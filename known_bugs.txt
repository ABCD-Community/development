CISIS

- 'to'-parameter in UTF8 version is not working correctly


Central

- special cisis_ver database cannot be selected as first database to open in main central menu, but can be opened well from next screen.
- iah_edit_db.php javascript-functions (e.g. edit index) not always working  => solved by <?php on line 84
- POST method in wxis_llamar.php replaced by $result=file_get_contents($url); because other method no longer working in recent versions of Linux
  new : file_get_contents now uses 'context' variables passed, seems to work well.

iAh

- 'to'-parameter in iax.xis avoided and replaced by count=100
