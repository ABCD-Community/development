<p>Foreword
</p>
<p>Energy efficiency has always been a major challenge for the scientist and the
</p>
<p>engineers. However, in recent years, the increased public concern for the preser-
</p>
<p>vation of natural resources and the protection of the environment has strongly
</p>
<p>stimulated the research and development activities in this area. More than 20,000
</p>
<p>technical papers written in 2016 and stored in &ldquo;Scopus&rdquo; database have &ldquo;energy
</p>
<p>efficiency&rdquo; in their title, in their abstract or in their list of keywords. There were less
</p>
<p>than 4000 in 1996.
</p>
<p>Energy harvesting is a much more recent topic. Less than 100 papers addressed
</p>
<p>it twenty years ago. More than 2500 articles were published in top-level journals
</p>
<p>from January to October 2016. The reason behind this spectacular growth is simple:
</p>
<p>Both academia and industry are interested in the design and engineering of
</p>
<p>energy-autonomous small electronic devices that can harvest the various forms of
</p>
<p>energy available in the environment (solar, eolian, and hydraulic) and convert them
</p>
<p>to electric power. The development of energy-harvesting applications is driven by
</p>
<p>the increased need of autonomous wireless electronic systems in various fields of
</p>
<p>human activities, ranging from medicine and aeronautics to civil engineering and
</p>
<p>animal tracking.
</p>
<p>Textbooks and monographs are already available for anyone who wants to learn
</p>
<p>more on either &ldquo;energy efficiency&rdquo; or &ldquo;energy harvesting.&rdquo; The merit of this book is
</p>
<p>that it brings together the two topics, which are more and more interrelated. The
</p>
<p>editors carefully selected the topics to be treated, and each chapter of this book is
</p>
<p>written by well-recognized experts in the field. This book introduces the reader to
</p>
<p>up-to-date research on nonlinearity of energy-harvesting systems, energy efficiency
</p>
<p>of hybrid power systems, and optimal design of autonomous electronic systems. It
</p>
<p>also contains instructive case studies and examples of experimental validation of the
</p>
<p>novel energy-saving or energy-harvesting techniques.

<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Energy harvesting and energy efficiency are two key topics for today&rsquo;s power
</p>
<p>community. In the development of modern society, one of the key factors is to save
</p>
<p>energy in order to become more independent of other resources. Two important
</p>
<p>approaches can be taken&mdash;one is to change behavior and thereby save energy and
</p>
<p>the second is to develop new technology which is able to save energy in different
</p>
<p>applications. Chapter 1 gives an overview of challenges and possibilities in terms of
</p>
<p>energy saving and also energy efficient use.
</p>
<p>Initially, the first key topic&mdash;energy harvesting&mdash;becomes one of the most
</p>
<p>motivated fields of the multidisciplinary science due to the complicated features
</p>
<p>of the harvester materials, dependences on various mechanical, electrical, and
</p>
<p>magnetic parameters, rich responses on different external excitation frequencies and
</p>
<p>strength. Strictly speaking, vibrations stem from either man-made systems or nat-
</p>
<p>ural processes can be used as an important electric resource for
</p>
<p>low-power-consuming electronic devices such as transducers and wireless sensors.
</p>
<p>That can contribute at the batteryless applications for much sustainable and
</p>
<p>renewable power generation, whereas some technical problems should be solved to
</p>
<p>achieve the expectations of the electronics society. Although conventional har-
</p>
<p>vesters work on the basis of linear resonance, there exist certain parametrical
</p>
<p>limitations on their power generation. Indeed, excitation frequency, electrical load,
</p>
<p>manufacturing tolerance, and ambient temperature play important roles in order to
</p>
<p>determine the optimized energy generation. Besides, the nonlinear nature of the
</p>
<p>vibration phenomena contributes at the power, and these nonlinear effects cannot be
</p>
<p>neglected for an optimized harvester system. Thus, Part I of this book initially gives
</p>
<p>an outline to the reader on the electromagnetic and piezoelectric energy-harvesting
</p>
<p>systems and then focuses on the theoretical and experimental techniques by
</p>
<p>introducing different harvester systems.
</p>
<p>In that context, Chap. 2 describes the harvesting sources with classical and novel
</p>
<p>types for the use of electromagnetic and piezoelectric hybrid structures. Various
</p>
<p>vii</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>experimental systems are described in detail in order to compare their output
</p>
<p>powers and their relation to the system parameters.
</p>
<p>The batteryless applications of microscale harvesters have been explained in
</p>
<p>Chap. 3 for information technologies (IT). The importance of low-power harvesting
</p>
<p>systems for IT applications is particularly emphasized, and model systems have
</p>
<p>been discussed. One of the important practice areas of the harvesters is wireless
</p>
<p>sensor application. Therefore, a specific chapter (i.e., Chap. 4) is dedicated to the
</p>
<p>problems of electromagnetic and piezoelectric harvesters in wireless devices. This
</p>
<p>chapter gives both experimental and theoretical details on the matter. As the har-
</p>
<p>vester systems have complicated equilibrium features for their time- and
</p>
<p>space-dependent nature, nonlinearity plays an important role to identify their
</p>
<p>dynamic behavior and power-generation strategy. Therefore, Chap. 5 is devoted to
</p>
<p>the nonlinear problems of the harvesters. Although the energy-harvesting issues
</p>
<p>mostly cover the systems related to the piezoelectric and electromagnetic ones in
</p>
<p>low power range, the most frequent energy-generation system&mdash;photovoltaics
</p>
<p>(PV) has been an important topic. Therefore, Chap. 6 focuses on the control phe-
</p>
<p>nomena of PV hybrid systems.
</p>
<p>It can be emphasized that the chapters mentioned above provide a good back-
</p>
<p>ground to the reader on the harvester systems and their applications. Both experi-
</p>
<p>mental and theoretical approaches to different harvesting problems help to
</p>
<p>understand the advanced problems and cutting-edge information, world widely,
</p>
<p>thereby the readers at different educational levels from undergraduate to the pro-
</p>
<p>fessionals can find interesting research topics in order to apply in their own studies.
</p>
<p>Other main topic of this book is the energy efficiency. Due to the increasing
</p>
<p>population and industrial growth, energy efficiency has become a popular topic for
</p>
<p>every level of communities from ordinary to technical. There exist many attempts
</p>
<p>today that the energy efficiency itself can be counted as a new energy resource.
</p>
<p>Thus, interdisciplinary studies, which have been carried out in the fields of
</p>
<p>renewable energy, focus on different mechanisms that decrease the losses of the
</p>
<p>energy in methodological ways. In light of the present technology, the efficiency
</p>
<p>cannot be considered detached from the cost. Strictly speaking, the balance between
</p>
<p>the efficiency and system cost should be ascertained. With that respect, many
</p>
<p>energy systems such as solar, wind, and tidal can make use of good-quality
</p>
<p>materials or efficiency techniques if they are financially appropriate. Therefore,
</p>
<p>Chaps. 7&ndash;9 are devoted to the sun-tracking applications and maximal power point
</p>
<p>tracking (MPPT) techniques in PVs. In these chapters, both practices and theoretical
</p>
<p>backgrounds on the tracking mechanisms are presented including the case studies.
</p>
<p>Chapter 10 mentions the partial shading effect on the PV systems and clarifies the
</p>
<p>methodology on the solution of MPPT for those systems. The applications on solar
</p>
<p>cars are presented in Chap. 11. This chapter also sheds a light on the polymer
</p>
<p>composite materials in order to enhance the efficiency and gives some information
</p>
<p>on the charging stations.
</p>
<p>The increasing demand for electricity supply along with higher requirements for
</p>
<p>power quality and system reliability, restrictions to use the available fossil fuels,
</p>
<p>and minimization of the environmental pollutants leads to the aggregation of clean
</p>
<p>viii Preface</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>energy sources (renewable energy sources, fuel cell, etc.) in distributed generation
</p>
<p>systems and developing microgrids. Consequently, the energy efficiency of hybrid
</p>
<p>power system that integrates such clean energy sources must be improved through
</p>
<p>appropriate energy management strategies. Thus, the remaining parts of the book,
</p>
<p>namely II, III, and IV, analyze the energy efficiency based on fuel cell, PV, wind,
</p>
<p>and hybrid power systems.
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; means the use of other energy storage devices, or multiple
</p>
<p>input energy sources in hybrid power sources to sustain the load demand. Thus, the
</p>
<p>use of fuel cell system as energy source or energy storage devices in conjunction
</p>
<p>with an electrolyzer is analyzed in Chaps. 12 and 13. While Chap. 12 analyzes the
</p>
<p>possibility to use the extremum seeking control schemes for the reduction of
</p>
<p>hydrogen consumption in fuel cell hybrid power sources, Chap. 13 analyzes the
</p>
<p>efficiency of a fuel cell hybrid power source required for an automotive application.
</p>
<p>Chapter 14 proposes a stochastic model to analyze the microgrids with the goal of
</p>
<p>profit maximization and imbalance cost minimization. In this framework, a new
</p>
<p>method based on neural network theory is proposed for predicting wind speed and
</p>
<p>solar radiation. Other chapter (i.e., Chap. 15) analyzes the energy efficiency of a
</p>
<p>micro-combined cooling, heating, and power system driven by a solar dish stirling
</p>
<p>heat engine that is used for residential buildings. A novel methodology was
</p>
<p>introduced for short-term scheduling of small-scale trigeneration system, which can
</p>
<p>be used optimally and efficiently to provide cooling, heating, and power for resi-
</p>
<p>dential applications, being environmentally friendliness, cost-cutting, and on-site
</p>
<p>applied.
</p>
<p>The last part of this book is dedicated to some technical strategies, efficient
</p>
<p>methods, and applications in field of energy efficiency, so it will be of interest for all
</p>
<p>current researchers and specialists in that field as well as for technicians.
</p>
<p>Chapter 16 presents wired and wireless communication systems in smart homes
</p>
<p>and buildings based on the recent developments proposed in applications. The basic
</p>
<p>principles of the smart homes and energy efficient buildings are introduced firstly in
</p>
<p>order to provide basic knowledge for readers and the chapter also gives an idea on
</p>
<p>the communication systems used for outdoor and indoor scenarios. Chapters 17 and
</p>
<p>18 propose new flexible hybrid architecture for the power-conditioning unit for
</p>
<p>small satellites. Since the space agencies all over the world are interested today in
</p>
<p>very small satellites due to their advantages compared to heavier satellites, the
</p>
<p>advanced techniques are discussed including their converter and storage systems.
</p>
<p>The batteries are unavoidable for any electricity system. Therefore, while
</p>
<p>making a discussion on the efficiency issues, one should also consider the storage
</p>
<p>techniques. Chapter 19 introduces a new method for determining the optimal model
</p>
<p>of batteries, puts a starting point in analyzing their discharge profiles, and employs a
</p>
<p>multicriteria analysis for processing the experimental data.
</p>
<p>While considering the efficiency in solar, fuel cell and related hybrid systems,
</p>
<p>the energy efficiency in wind and water distribution systems should also be men-
</p>
<p>tioned. In this manner, the optimal planning and operation of water distribution is
</p>
<p>presented in Chap. 20. This problem mainly involves the establishment of the
</p>
<p>operation schedule for all water hydrophore stations and uses a database of 85 urban
</p>
<p>Preface ix</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>water hydrophore stations as a case study. Finally, the last chapter (i.e., Chap. 21)
</p>
<p>provides an overview about available knowledge, references, and investigations on
</p>
<p>the active and passive flow control devices, initially developed for aeronautical
</p>
<p>industry that are currently being investigated and introduced on wind turbines in
</p>
<p>order to improve their efficiency.
</p>
<p>As a conclusion, a sustained research in the field of energy efficiency does not
</p>
<p>only give more chances to significant reduction of carbon dioxide, greenhouse gas
</p>
<p>emissions, and environmental pollution, but also increases the economic saving in
</p>
<p>fuel consumption and use of energy sources. Therefore, this book tries to highlight
</p>
<p>the difficulties of the basic methods on energy harvesting and energy efficiency and
</p>
<p>proposes advanced methods to solve these issues. All proposed methods were
</p>
<p>validated through simulation and experimental results. These &ldquo;hot subjects&rdquo; will be
</p>
<p>of interest for many decades and, at the same time, will be a challenge and hard task
</p>
<p>for the researchers all over the world, considering the new energy policies due to
</p>
<p>energy crisis.
</p>
<p>We hope that this book will be very efficient for students and engineers who
</p>
<p>learn and wish to work in this field, because the chapters of this book cover all
</p>
<p>important and challenging subjects related to energy harvesting and energy effi-
</p>
<p>ciency. The book comprises the knowledgeable and up-to-date contents that present
</p>
<p>the state-of-the-art equipment and methods used for the energy harvesting and
</p>
<p>energy efficiency. Finally, the main arguments that may recommend this book to be
</p>
<p>read are the following: (1) It is the first comprehensive book on energy harvesting
</p>
<p>and energy efficiency of the power hybrid systems; (2) covers the operating prin-
</p>
<p>ciples, design methods, and real applications; (3) enables the low power for
</p>
<p>autonomous electronic system design; (4) introduces the high-power density
</p>
<p>technology and adiabatic concept to efficiently design the mission critical systems;
</p>
<p>(5) provides a much-needed system approach to hydrogen energy applications;
</p>
<p>(6) provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of renewable power
</p>
<p>generation, conversion, and storage; and the last, but not the least, (7) can be used
</p>
<p>as a course text.
</p>
<p>The editors and authors made all efforts to have a good book, and we hope
</p>
<p>interested readers to enjoy by reading this book and to be satisfied by its content.

</p>
<p>Energy Saving and Efficient Energy Use
</p>
<p>By Power Electronic Systems
</p>
<p>Frede Blaabjerg, Huai Wang, Pooya Davari, Xiaohui Qu
</p>
<p>and Firuz Zare
</p>
<p>Abstract In the development of the modern society, one of the key factors is to
</p>
<p>save energy in order to become more independent of other energy resources. Two
</p>
<p>important approaches can be taken&mdash;one is to change behavior and thereby save
</p>
<p>energy&mdash;the second one is to develop new technology which is able to save energy
</p>
<p>in different applications. This chapter will give an overview of challenges and
</p>
<p>possibilities in terms of energy saving and also energy efficient use. This includes a
</p>
<p>discussion on high efficiency power electronics devices and the systems they are
</p>
<p>used for energy loss reduction. The key enabling technologies are power elec-
</p>
<p>tronics, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as well as systems to
</p>
<p>carry the electrical energy through power transmission, conversion and distribution.
</p>
<p>A couple of examples will be given to demonstrate the energy saving possibilities
</p>
<p>by power electronics systems, such as in the applications of adjustable speed drives
</p>
<p>and solid-state lighting systems. Power electronics gives also a high flexibility when
</p>
<p>renewable power production is introduced to electrical energy systems. Future
</p>
<p>research opportunities and challenges will finally be discussed.

<p>1.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Among the technologies that support the growth of clean energy and the
</p>
<p>improvement of energy efficiency, power electronics has been representing a major
</p>
<p>enabler. It provides efficient conversion and flexible control of electrical energy.
</p>
<p>The power electronics converters make possible the connection of renewable
</p>
<p>energy generators to the legacy power systems, as schematically shown in Fig. 1.1,
</p>
<p>and efficiency improvement of energy harvesting through dedicated controls.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, power electronics is extensively used on the consumer side and is a
</p>
<p>core technology for the new smart grid [1]. It unlocks the potentials of energy
</p>
<p>savings in motor drives, buildings (e.g., lighting, energy-efficient appliances),
</p>
<p>transportation (e.g., electric vehicles, high speed trains), consumer electronics (e.g.,
</p>
<p>computers, cell phones), etc.

<p>1.2 Electrical Energy Generation and Consumption
</p>
<p>Today more than 40% of all energy consumption is in the form of electrical energy,
</p>
<p>which is expected to grow to 60% by 2040 [2]. The generation of the electrical
</p>
<p>energy is becoming more renewable-based as shown in Fig. 1.2, which is according
</p>
<p>to the projection by the International Energy Agency (IEA) [3]. The power gen-
</p>
<p>eration capacity worldwide is expected to increase by 80%, from 5,952 GW in 2014
</p>
<p>to about 10,700 GW in 2040. During this period, about 2,250 GW power capacity
</p>
<p>currently in operation and about 200 GW capacity from newly commissioned
</p>
<p>renewables is expected to be retired due to the end of service life. The cost gap
</p>
<p>between electricity generated from renewable sources and fossil fuels is narrowing
</p>
<p>as discussed in [1]. Connection of the electrical energy generated from renewable
</p>
<p>energy sources (e.g., wind power and photovoltaics) to power grids is not possible
</p>
<p>without power electronics based energy conversion systems.
</p>
<p>The generated electrical energy is consumed by different sectors, such as
</p>
<p>industry, residential, and transportation. The transportation sector sees a clear
</p>
<p>electrification both in cars and ships, and also in air-planes which is made possible
</p>
<p>by means of power electronics. In terms of applications, motor drives, and lighting
</p>

<p>are two of the dominant ones, which will be discussed in the next two sections,
</p>
<p>respectively. The end-use energy efficiency of these applications plays a key role in
</p>
<p>reducing CO2 emissions as discussed in [4, 5].
</p>
<p>1.3 Power Electronics for Adjustable Speed Drives
</p>
<p>Electric motors consume more than 40% of global electrical energy, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.3. This share is even higher in industrial applications, where electric motors
</p>
<p>are utilized for approximately 64% of industrial electricity consumption [6, 7].
</p>
<p>In fact, the high demand for electric motors in different applications such as
</p>
<p>pumps, fans and conveyer systems has made them as the major source of electricity
</p>
<p>consumption. Therefore, developing energy efficient motor drive systems holds a
</p>
<p>great potential for reducing the worldwide energy consumption.
</p>
<p>Introducing Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD) based on power electronics tech-
</p>
<p>nology leads to more energy efficient motor drive systems. An ASD improves
</p>
<p>energy efficiency of a system by controlling the speed of motor at an optimal speed
</p>
<p>and/or torque. Hence, the energy consumption of the motor is reduced from full
</p>
<p>power to a partial power for the same performance (i.e., speed and/or torque).
</p>
<p>However, in order to achieve the maximum possible energy savings of a system,
</p>
<p>understanding the application demand and operating mode of an ASD, its system
</p>
<p>architecture and components are mandatory.
</p>
<p>1.3.1 Motor Drive Applications
</p>
<p>ASDs only contribute to energy saving when different speeds and/or torques are
</p>
<p>required over time. This means that adding an ASD unit to a motor which has to
</p>
<p>operate continuously at full speed and full load only result in excessive losses.
</p>

</p>
<p>motor drive system is utilized to adjust the speed based on the applied voltage and
</p>
<p>frequency.
</p>
<p>In reality, in most of ASD applications, their load profiles vary over time and the
</p>
<p>systems are commonly operated in partial load conditions [8]. However, the energy
</p>
<p>saving potential is different in every application and it can be exploited by
</p>
<p>understanding the application demand (Fig. 1.5).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.3.2 System Architecture
</p>
<p>Electric motors can operate in generative mode when decelerating from one speed
</p>
<p>to another or during a braking mode. As illustrated in Fig. 1.6a, standard ASDs are
</p>
<p>equipped with the conventional line-commutated front-end rectifiers, which provide
</p>
<p>unidirectional power flow [9]. Therefore, the regenerated power will be dissipated
</p>
<p>in braking resistors as heat. Feeding the regenerated power back to the grid may
</p>
<p>improve the system energy efficiency to some extent [8, 10]. This requires bidi-
</p>
<p>rectional power flow in ASDs which is achievable by replacing the conventional
</p>
<p>front-end rectifier with a regenerative rectifier such as Active Front-End (AFE). The
</p>
<p>resulting system is known as back-to-back topology shown in Fig. 1.6b.
</p>
<p>Although most applications generate energy during deceleration and braking, but
</p>
<p>feeding back this energy to the grid not necessarily justify the use of regenerative
</p>
<p>rectifiers in an ASD system. This is due to the fact that a regenerative rectifier
</p>
<p>accounts for more active components comparing with a standard rectifier unit.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>However, despite the losses in an ASD system, to select proper system architecture
</p>
<p>the grid side efficiency needs to be accounted as well.
</p>
<p>From power quality point of view the main concern with ASD systems is the
</p>
<p>generation of current harmonics which may lead to high losses and stability issues in
</p>
<p>the grid [11]. To cancel out the harmonics, additional passive or active filtering needs
</p>
<p>to be employed at the front-end stage of the ASD [12&ndash;14]. While such a technique
</p>
<p>has been matured in single-phase systems, known as Power Factor Correction
</p>
<p>(PFC), it still remains a big challenge in three-phase systems [7, 9, 12&ndash;14].
</p>
<p>Notably, regenerative rectifiers such as AFE extensively improve input current
</p>
<p>quality which leads to a better power quality and lower losses from grid side point
</p>
<p>of view [7, 10]. Therefore, employing a back-to-back system can only be validated
</p>
<p>by considering the motor regenerative load cycle versus the additional costs and
</p>
<p>losses affecting both the ASD and the grid.
</p>
<p>Another alternative approach in improving energy efficiency is employing a
</p>
<p>multi-drive or cascaded configuration (Fig. 1.7). In many applications it is a com-
</p>
<p>mon practice to employ parallel connected drive units (e.g., multi-pump arrange-
</p>
<p>ment) [7, 8, 15]. In this situation the application demand is met using multiple
</p>
<p>modestly sized motor units rather than one single large unit. Hence, depending on
</p>
<p>the applied control strategy such as multi-follower or multi-master the load can be
</p>
<p>shared across the drive units evenly or unevenly, respectively [15]. This configu-
</p>
<p>ration can satisfy partial load conditions more efficiently by keeping majority of units
</p>
<p>in standby mode. Moreover, it allows easier system diagnosis and leads to better
</p>
<p>redundancy. More importantly, by implementing a proper interaction among the
</p>
<p>parallel connected units the input current harmonics can be significantly reduced
</p>
<p>leading to a better power quality and losses from grid side point of view [7].

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.3.3 System Components
</p>
<p>Every component contributes to system losses. In power electronics systems
</p>
<p>switching losses of power semiconductors dominate significant share of total sys-
</p>
<p>tem losses. Figure 1.8 illustrates typical structures for unidirectional and bidirec-
</p>
<p>tional ASD systems. It is obvious that the bidirectional topology having AFE
</p>
<p>includes larger number of active power switches. Notably, the chopper switch used
</p>
<p>for braking operation is not in continuous operation in the unidirectional topology.
</p>
<p>In fact, the introduction of additional losses, cost and size cannot justify the
</p>
<p>investment in more complex topologies such as AFE in most of the three-phase
</p>
<p>ASDs.
</p>
<p>However, the advent of new power semiconductor devices, known as Wide
</p>
<p>Band-Gap (WBG) devices, and their continuous decreasing price due to market
</p>
<p>demand can break through many barriers and provide more degrees of freedom.
</p>
<p>Employing WBG devices at front-end stage not only significantly improve per-
</p>
<p>formance of single-phase systems, but also offer an opportunity to revolutionize the
</p>
<p>next generation of three-phase ASD systems.
</p>
<p>To sum up, although each three aforementioned sections can affect energy
</p>
<p>efficiency, but the ultimate efficiency are to be made by optimizing the entire
</p>
<p>system, which can be obtained by considering a trade-off between different sections.

<p>1.4 Power Electronics for Lighting
</p>
<p>1.4.1 Evolution of Lighting Technology
</p>
<p>Since the first incandescent light bulb was invented in 1879, lighting began to
</p>
<p>consume electrical energy. Nowadays electric lighting has accounted for 22% of the
</p>
<p>total electricity energy used in the world [16], and about 10% of the average
</p>
<p>household&rsquo;s energy use goes into lighting costs. Hence, energy-efficient lighting is
</p>
<p>potential to improve the global energy saving and cut users&rsquo; energy cost.
</p>
<p>In the last century, technology evolution has occurred in the lighting sources,
</p>
<p>which brings various efficient and durable lighting lamps suitable for different
</p>
<p>indoor and outdoor applications. According to the technology development, they
</p>
<p>can be classified as heated filaments (e.g., traditional incandescent and
</p>
<p>energy-saving incandescent (tungsten halogen) lamps), gas dischargers (e.g.,
</p>
<p>tubular and compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), and high intensity discharge
</p>
<p>(HID) lamps), and currently most promising solid state lighting, i.e., Light-Emitting
</p>
<p>Diode (LED) lamps. Figure 1.9 compares the luminous efficacy among these dif-
</p>
<p>ferent types of lamps, where the LED lighting has incomparable advantages on high
</p>
<p>luminous efficiency and also extremely long lifetime to become the dominant
</p>
<p>lighting source in the near future.
</p>
<p>To promote more energy saving, some government in the world, such as
</p>
<p>European Union, United States, and China have introduced measures to phase out
</p>
<p>traditional incandescent lamps gradually [17]. LED lamps are the prospective
</p>
<p>successors.
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.9 Comparison of luminous efficacy among different types of lighting lamps

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.4.2 Energy Efficient and Intelligent Lighting Power
</p>
<p>Electronics
</p>
<p>Due to different light emitting principles, some lamps may not operate properly or
</p>
<p>even fail without power electronic drivers. Efficient lighting power electronics can
</p>
<p>improve the efficiency by a minimum of 20%. Intelligent power electronic drivers
</p>
<p>with dimming can further save on average an additional 30%.
</p>
<p>Filament incandescent lamps can be heated directly by AC mains. TRIAC
</p>
<p>incandescent dimmer can change the turn-on phase of input voltage to dim light.
</p>
<p>Compared to incandescent lamps, gas discharge lamps offer higher efficiency, but
</p>
<p>are more complicated to manufacture and require auxiliary electronic equipment
</p>
<p>such as high voltage initiation circuit to excite the gas atoms and driving ballast to
</p>
<p>control current flow through the gas. Thus, the frequent turning on and off for these
</p>
<p>lamps will affect the operating life and there are some rules for CFL blub dimming.
</p>
<p>As the current-driven semiconductor, LEDs have fast dynamic response and the
</p>
<p>operating life is unaffected by turning them on and off. A small increment in driving
</p>
<p>voltage will cause the current increasing dramatically. Therefore, an LED driver
</p>
<p>should provide a constant DC current for a stable light color and lumen output.
</p>
<p>Figure 1.10 shows the typical LED driving configuration with accurate current
</p>
<p>control for each LED lamp. Generally, the LED dimming have three main methods:
</p>
<p>amplitude modulation (AM), pulse-width modulation (PWM) and TRIAC dim-
</p>
<p>ming. AM and PWM dimming can be integrated in LED driver with smart and
</p>
<p>simple dimming control for user requirement. TRIAC dimmers are suitable for the
</p>
<p>interim lighting fixtures, which are expected to have the ability of accommodating
</p>
<p>both incandescent bulbs and LED retrofit lamps to save the cost.
</p>
<p>For the potential solid state lighting, advanced power electronics not only
</p>
<p>improves the energy saving in the energy transformation, but also ensures a reliable
</p>
<p>and durable operation to reduce the running and maintenance cost. For example, the
</p>
<p>least reliable components in the LED driver are energy-buffering electrolytic
</p>
<p>capacitors, i.e., the main storage capacitor as shown in Fig. 1.10, most of which last
</p>
<p>below 5,000 h, far from the LED lifetime. LEDs emit heat, and 70&ndash;80% of
</p>

</p>
<p>multiple lamps

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>electrical power are radiated as heat. Without good thermal control, heat from LEDs
</p>
<p>and driver will significantly reduce the LED output lumen efficiency and lifetime.
</p>
<p>By taking into account the electrical, thermal and optical issues, efficient and
</p>
<p>intelligent lighting power electronics should integrate sensors, actuators and dim-
</p>
<p>mer control schemes to offer more functions, and develop more compact, efficient,
</p>
<p>and reliable drivers and control, leading to optimal LED lighting systems.
</p>
<p>The future of both domestic and professional lighting is in the application of
</p>
<p>LEDs, by taking advantages of the technology&rsquo;s intrinsic qualities. This will lead to
</p>
<p>products that inspire designers and enable lighting to develop in ways that con-
</p>
<p>ventional lighting systems could never do.
</p>
<p>1.5 Emerging Opportunities and Challenges
</p>
<p>Power electronics technology is highly evolving and becoming more and more
</p>
<p>multi-disciplinary based, bringing new opportunities and challenges in energy
</p>
<p>saving and electrical energy conditioning. One of the promising opportunities is the
</p>
<p>commercialization of WBG semiconductor devices (e.g., SiC and GaN) in the last
</p>
<p>decade. These new devices enable further power loss reductions and extended
</p>
<p>operation ranges, which are otherwise limited by Si based devices in terms of
</p>
<p>voltage rating and maximum allowable junction temperature. Figure 1.11 shows the
</p>
<p>figure of merit of SiC, GaN, and Si devices [18]. One of the important challenges is

</p>
<p>1.6 Conclusions
</p>
<p>The key role of power electronics in energy saving and highly-efficient electrical
</p>
<p>energy conditioning is discussed in this chapter. More and more power electronics
</p>
<p>systems will be used, especially as renewables are becoming the mainstreamed
</p>
<p>electrical energy sources, and the transportation sector sees a clear trend of elec-
</p>
<p>trification. The power electronics applications in ASDs and solid-state lighting
</p>
<p>systems are discussed. The future opportunities in WBG power semiconductor
</p>
<p>devices and the challenges in reliability aspect performance are also addressed.

</p>
<p>Abstract In this millennium, the methodologies to harvest existing dissipated
</p>
<p>powers not only supply input energy to our sophisticated devices, but also con-
</p>
<p>tribute the current technological researches and developments. Single harvester
</p>
<p>generator or harvesting single power source may remain insufficient for the energy
</p>
<p>feed into the systems like electronic devices, biosensors, human, structural and
</p>
<p>machine health monitoring, and wireless sensor nodes. To overcome this problem,
</p>
<p>hybridization of energy harvesters (EHs) takes place to increase the limited energy
</p>
<p>generation of stand-alone EHs. In this chapter, piezoelectric and electromagnetic
</p>
<p>generators are compared and classic as well as novel hybrid energy harvester (HEH)
</p>
<p>designs are reviewed by considering fixed-frequency; broadband including linear,
</p>
<p>nonlinear and tunable HEHs; multimode; and multisource powered configurations.
</p>
<p>This review covers two-, three-, four-multi source powered HEHs in micro-, meso-
</p>
<p>and large-scales. Overall comparisons of classic and novel HEHs are tabulated and
</p>
<p>discussed in detail in order to guide potential researchers. In the scope of this

<p>2.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Ever since the beginning of the industrial age, being independent from man and
</p>
<p>animal power sources, especially at greater energy levels, was the greatest inno-
</p>
<p>vation. As the time passes by, the more technological improvements occur along
</p>
<p>18 N. Gure et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>with wireless networks, the more devices are in our lives thus, elevating the quality
</p>
<p>of life, production and work. In spite of the efforts to decrease the energy input of
</p>
<p>the electronic devices, this ever increasing demand on energy surprisingly takes us
</p>
<p>to seek using existing power sources like human movement, known as kinesiology,
</p>
<p>similar to the energy source before industrial age [1&ndash;3]. In this millennium, the
</p>
<p>methodologies to harvest existing dissipated powers not only supply input energy to
</p>
<p>our sophisticated devices, but also contribute the current technological researches
</p>
<p>and developments. Among energy harvesting (EHing) systems, one of the inno-
</p>
<p>vative research trend is on hybrid energy harvesters [4, 5].
</p>
<p>Obeying the first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy implies that the
</p>
<p>existing and dissipated power sources can be scavenged and transduce into usable
</p>
<p>electrical energy [1]. Up until recently, energy harvester (EH) need is arose by the
</p>
<p>dominant use of electronic devices, biosensors, human, structural and machine
</p>
<p>health monitoring, and wireless sensor nodes [6&ndash;9]. Single harvester generator or
</p>
<p>harvesting single power source, also known as stand-alone EH, may produce low
</p>
<p>output powers to supply energy to the system. For sufficient energy feed to these
</p>
<p>vast varieties of applications, hybridization of EHs takes place to increase the
</p>
<p>limited energy generation of stand-alone EHs [10&ndash;23].
</p>
<p>Harnessing multiple power sources or combining multiple generators for energy
</p>
<p>extraction in a single unit is called &ldquo;hybrid energy harvesting or multimodal energy
</p>
<p>harvesting&rdquo; [24&ndash;27].
</p>
<p>In this chapter, piezoelectric (PE) and electromagnetic (EM) generators are
</p>
<p>compared in Sect. 2.2. Classic HEH designs and novel configurations are reviewed
</p>
<p>in Sects. 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 covers fixed-frequency,
</p>
<p>broadband HEHs, and their comparisons. Furthermore, Sect. 2.4 includes multi-
</p>
<p>mode vibration HEHs and multisource powered energy harvesters along with
</p>
<p>meso-, micro- and large-scale applications. In the final part, HEH performances and
</p>
<p>evaluations are compared and concluded.
</p>
<p>2.2 Comparison of Piezoelectric and Electromagnetic
</p>
<p>Generators
</p>
<p>EM energy harvesters (EMHs) generate power based on faraday&rsquo;s law of induction,
</p>
<p>which equates the time derivative of flux to the electromotive force. As the scale
</p>
<p>shrinks to microscopic level, the decreased coil area results smaller magnetic flux.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, quasi-static (ultra-low-frequency) movements increase the time
</p>
<p>intervals. Thus, both factors lead electromotive force to approach to zero. Apart
</p>
<p>from the fabrication boundaries of coil diameters and turns, theoretically EM har-
</p>
<p>vesters are bound to be limited at low speeds [28]. Thus, EM harvesters perform
</p>
<p>better at high frequencies and PE harvesters outperform at low frequencies [8].
</p>
<p>Additionally, at microscale level, EMH output voltage generally stays lower than
</p>
<p>the need to power devices [17]. As a result, piezoelectric and electrostatic harvesters
</p>
<p>2 Hybrid Energy Harvesters (HEHs)&mdash;A Review 19</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>are more suitable for microscale applications, while electrostatic systems hold
</p>
<p>greater advantage due to the ease of integration to microelectromechanical systems
</p>
<p>(MEMs) [27].
</p>
<p>Similar to EMHs, PE harvesters (PEHs) do not require voltage source while
</p>
<p>electrostatic generators require separate voltage source and more difficult in prac-
</p>
<p>tice, and in contrast to EMHs, PEHs produce sufficient output voltage but at low
</p>
<p>current level [8, 19, 27]. Among these three types of transducers, piezoelectric
</p>
<p>generators are the simplest ones in terms of required components, transducer
</p>
<p>geometries and directly converting mechanical energy to voltage output [9]. In
</p>
<p>addition to PEHs, at macroscopic level, EMHs also provide simplicity in geometry,
</p>
<p>design and production [19].
</p>
<p>In conclusion, PEHs are applicable for micro-, meso- and large-scales, while
</p>
<p>EMHs are easily manufactured and although they perform better at mesoscale, they
</p>
<p>are integrable to MEMs. As a result, abundant PE and EM HEH are reviewed and
</p>
<p>compared in the following sections.
</p>
<p>2.3 Classic HEH Systems
</p>
<p>While tremendous amounts of multimode energy harvesters (EHs) are possible,
</p>
<p>there exist such PE and EM combination that takes the greatest research and
</p>
<p>development interest and turns out to be classic. As listed in Fig. 2.1, these are
</p>
<p>composed of piezoelectric plate or patch attachment on Euler-Bernoulli beam and
</p>
<p>either magnetic or coil tip mass is surrounded by respective coil or magnets to
</p>
<p>achieve faraday law of induction [29].
</p>
<p>In this chapter, PE unimorph and bimorph structures; comparison of rectangular
</p>
<p>and trapezoidal beams; four and two poles magnet configurations and comparisons;
</p>
<p>serial, parallel and isolated connections of PE and EM transducers in HEHs;
</p>
<p>fixed-frequency applications; and rarely studied broadband HEH designs are
</p>
<p>reviewed.
</p>
<p>2.3.1 Fixed-Frequency Classic HEHs
</p>
<p>Figures 2.1 and 2.2 shows the classic HEH designs and fabrications, respectively.
</p>
<p>As a brief summary, in 2008, Wischke and Woias researched PE layers on uni-
</p>
<p>morph and bimorph cantilevers with rectangular and trapezoidal layouts in HEH. It
</p>
<p>is seen that trapezoidal shape is not superior in terms of power generation and its
</p>
<p>fabrication is more complicated. Since unimorph HEH has greater tip velocity, EM
</p>
<p>transducer generates greater power. In contrast to unimorph design, bimorph PE
</p>
<p>part produces greater output than EM part. Upon this contrary output, authors
</p>
<p>suggest using greater tip mass (magnet) to reduce EM coupling [11]. Becker et al.

</p>
<p>Xu et al., both theoretically and experimentally analyzed PE and EM HEH.
</p>
<p>Theoretical optimum output power is 1.02 mW at 77.8 Hz and experimental value
</p>
<p>is 0.845 mW at the resonance frequency of 66 Hz under the vibration acceleration
</p>
<p>of 9.8 m/s2. Respective to single PE and EM transducer, output powers are 667 and

</p>
<p>and c [30, 32, 37] are the most common ones and the tip mass can either be two magnets as in (a),
</p>
<p>or single magnet surrounded by coils as in (b) [4, 15] and (c), or vertical coil surrounded by
</p>
<p>magnets as in (d) [20, 33, 38] as well as modified horizontal arrangement [21]. Along with varying
</p>
<p>PE length on beam, PE unimorph (d) and bimorph (a, b and c) cantilever configurations are also
</p>
<p>possible [11]. Interface circuit is schematically indicated on (d)

<p>0.32 mW at 9.8 m/s2 and 66 Hz. Xu et al. proves that presented HEH generates
</p>
<p>greater power than single EHs [31].
</p>
<p>Ali et al., investigated total power outputs of PE and EM harvesters in serial,
</p>
<p>parallel connection and separately. As seen in Fig. 2.1c, the HEH has approxi-
</p>
<p>mately 1000 turns and 4 magnets (25 � 10 � 5 mm3) with opposite polarization at
</p>
<p>cantilever tip. At the fixed input frequency of 76.2 Hz, total generated power is the
</p>
<p>highest when PE and EM transducers are isolated. While PEH generates 27.56 mW,
</p>
<p>EMH generates the lowest power output. Besides, single PEH output power is 3
</p>
<p>times greater than serial connected HEH and parallel connected HEH generates 3
</p>
<p>times more than single EM transducer [32].
</p>
<p>As a recent study, Xia et al. not only investigates the classic HEH but also
</p>
<p>compared the performances of HEH and EMH (Fig. 2.1c). Throughout the
</p>
<p>experiments best HEH case generated the output power of 2.26 mW with 41%
</p>
<p>efficiency at 23.3 Hz and 0.4 g input excitation and thus, greater performance
</p>
<p>compared to EMH alone. HEH not only owns greater output power and efficiency,
</p>
<p>but also enables broadband operation [33]. In contrast to these findings, Sang and
</p>
<p>Shan et al. experiments result that HEH has the almost the same resonance fre-
</p>
<p>quency with the PEH. Sang et al., considered the valuable Classic HEH

<p>configurations and yet, similar to Fig. 2.1c with only difference of having vertical
</p>
<p>coil placement on both sides of magnet is researched for four different cantilever
</p>
<p>lengths. HEH with cantilever and PE layer respective sizes of 50 � 15 � 1 mm3
</p>
<p>and 30 � 15 � 0.5 mm3, generated 10.7 mW while EM alone was 5.9 mW at
</p>
<p>50 Hz with the acceleration of 0.4 g [21]. Supportively, Shan et al. also reported
</p>
<p>that HEH produced greater output power of 4.25 mW than single PEH of 3.75 mW
</p>
<p>at 40.5 Hz and optimum loads. Their design is slightly modified version of
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.1c, d. The U-shaped magnet cage is fixed at the beam end and coil was fixed
</p>
<p>filling the gap in U-shape magnets during vibration [16].
</p>
<p>Ab Rahman et al. studied two and four pole magnet arrangements on classic
</p>
<p>HEH in Fig. 2.1a, d, respectively (see Fig. 2.3). It is experimentally proved that
</p>
<p>each HEH transducer with four-pole magnets produce greater output voltage than
</p>
<p>two pole HEH. When the input excitation is 1 g, generated output powers of four
</p>
<p>pole type PE and EM parts were 2.3 and 3.5 mW at 15 Hz, whereas those outputs
</p>
<p>were 0.5 and 1 mW at 49 Hz for two pole HEH [20, 34]. More detailed comparison
</p>
<p>of four-, two- and single magnet novel HEH performances are studied by
</p>
<p>Castagnetti and covered in Sect. 2.4.2 [35].
</p>
<p>2.3.2 Broadband Classic HEHs
</p>
<p>The ever-demanded ideal EH efficiently performs in wide bandwidth. In order to
</p>
<p>satisfy this demand, many researches have been conducted and broadband EHing is
</p>
<p>still one of the popular EHing research subjects. These researches include passive
</p>
<p>tuning either manually or with linear, non-linear, multi-stable and band-pass har-
</p>
<p>vester structures; and active tuning which may result in negative power outputs due

<p>to consumed energy by active parts and advanced electronic networks [26, 36, 37].
</p>
<p>Among these efforts, there are some classic HEH design approaches exist.
</p>
<p>Operation of an EH within wider frequency band is a very significant advantage in
</p>
<p>EHs. A few studied novel micro scale HEHs are also mentioned in this section for
</p>
<p>being broadband.
</p>
<p>Linear Classic HEH: In 2013, Ping Li et al. designed similar to Fig. 2.4b without
</p>
<p>fixed magnets. They analyzed their linear HEH performance under white noise
</p>
<p>excitement to model random vibration. Their sensitivity analysis indicated that the
</p>
<p>power generation of HEH dominantly affected by vibration frequency, damping
</p>
<p>ratio, coupling coefficients, which widens the bandwidth and increase power output
</p>
<p>as increases, and load resistances to achieve HEH impedance matching and max-
</p>
<p>imize power generation. While PE load directly proportional to resonance

<p/>

<p>frequency of harvester, EM load has almost no effect. The most efficient perfor-
</p>
<p>mances have the mean power levels of 0.44, 1.93, 4.2 mW at 77.5 Hz [17, 38].
</p>
<p>Tunable Classic HEH: Wischke et al. focused on frequency tuning method for
</p>
<p>HEH exactly shown in Fig. 2.1a and the picture of the prototype is on the in
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.2a. In this technique, voltage is introduced to the PE layer. Applied voltage
</p>
<p>changes the stiffness of the generator and relatedly, resonance frequency. By
</p>
<p>matching input frequency with tuned generator&rsquo;s resonance frequency, broadband
</p>
<p>operation is achieved. Electrode length&rsquo;s effect on tunability is also investigated and
</p>
<p>found that greater than 10 mm PE beam length, tunable range almost saturates
</p>
<p>between *50 to 60 Hz. To investigate widest tunable range, fabricated HEH
</p>
<p>cantilever length was 20 mm with the width of 5 mm. Extractable output powers
</p>
<p>from EM part is 60 lW, for PE part with parallel connection is around 200 lW and
</p>
<p>with serial connection it is 215 lW. EM transducer generated minimum of 50 lW
</p>
<p>at 56 Hz wide operation band width around the range of 267&ndash;323 Hz [25, 39].
</p>
<p>Non-linear Classic HEHs: One method to achieve broadband operation is that
</p>
<p>harvester to be nonlinear so that the frequency response range between half power
</p>
<p>outputs can be widen [35]. Li et al. summarized nonlinear broadband mechanism
</p>
<p>such that as nonlinearity increases, resonance frequency decreases and as the
</p>
<p>acceleration increases, half power bandwidth broadens, whereas resonance fre-
</p>
<p>quency decreases [4].
</p>
<p>As inspired from classic HEHs in Fig. 2.1b and c, Shan et al. design and
</p>
<p>materials are illustrated in Fig. 2.4a. In magnet configuration, poles are oppositely
</p>
<p>aligned so that indirectly exerted force on the suspended magnet can yield nonlinear
</p>
<p>mono-stable HEH [15]. Two peak powers and modes of HEH are 11.4 mW at
</p>
<p>8.373 Hz by EM and 21.6 mW at 14.83 Hz by PE transducers. At half peak power,
</p>
<p>the device band is around 7&ndash;17 Hz [15].
</p>
<p>In Addition to HEH in Fig. 2.1c, Xu et al. used same pole magnet aligned in
</p>
<p>front of the tip magnet (Fig. 2.2a) so that HEH can be nonlinear and operate at
</p>
<p>larger frequency band. Their nonlinear HEH prototype achieved 5.66 mW power
</p>
<p>output at 1 g, this result is 247% greater than at 0.5 g and at half power level
</p>
<p>(3 dB), the frequency band is 83.3% wider than PE transducer alone [40].
</p>
<p>Recently, HEH illustrated in Fig. 2.4b is researched by Mahmoudi et al. [29] and
</p>
<p>Ping Li et al. [4]. Their device mirrors the configuration in Fig. 2.1b; opposite pole
</p>
<p>magnet arrangement is used by Mahmoudi et al. and same pole magnet arrangement
</p>
<p>is used by Ping Li et al. While the moving magnet is shared with both symmet-
</p>
<p>rically placed beams having bimorph PE layers by Mahmoudi et al. and lead
</p>
<p>zirconate titanate (PZT) patches by Ping Li et al. For Mahmoudi et al. HEH, EM
</p>
<p>and PE parts respectively produce 39 and 61% of the power output. This EM
</p>
<p>transducer can increase power density by 60% up to 1035 mW/cm3 and bandwidth
</p>
<p>by 29% (155 to 220 Hz) at 0.9 g with respect to single EMHs [29]. Ping Li et al.
</p>
<p>deeply studied modeling, tests, effects of nonlinear factors, loads, input frequency
</p>
<p>and acceleration on amplitude, and found that their HEH design both enhance as
</p>
<p>wider band with low resonance frequency and greater power output compared to
</p>
<p>linear HEH designs. In contrast to linear EHs, optimal loads differ with excitation

<p>As a different vibration source and application on airflow harvesting system
</p>
<p>example, hybrid aeroelastic vibration EH is modeled by Dias et al. Their system
</p>
<p>includes an airfoil that is connected to fixed spring and damper at around mid-plane
</p>
<p>and starting that point, cantilever beam as seen in Fig. 2.1c is connected. Dias et al.
</p>
<p>propose 2 and 3 degree of freedom system dynamic modeling [41, 42]. Relatedly,
</p>
<p>novel aeroelastic HEH harvesting incident sunlight is proposed by Chatterjee and
</p>
<p>Bryant (Fig. 2.16), and their research is covered in Sect. 2.4.3.2. under &lsquo;Two-Multi
</p>
<p>Source Powered HEHs&rsquo; title.
</p>
<p>2.3.3 Overall Classic HEHs Comparision
</p>
<p>Up to this end, classic HEHs are classified and their performances are reviewed in
</p>
<p>terms of generated powers by EM and PE parts as well as the whole HEH system.
</p>
<p>The important factors of classic HEHs are peak power generations, HEH volumes,
</p>
<p>magnet masses, input excitations, input frequencies and half power band width
</p>
<p>ranges. Comparison of reviewed performances in Sects. 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, regarding
</p>
<p>mentioned factors are listed in Table 2.1.
</p>
<p>As seen in Table 2.1, among broadband and the whole classic HEHs, the
</p>
<p>greatest power output of total of 33 mW (21.6 mW by PEH and 11.4 mW by EMH)
</p>
<p>is achieved by Shan et al. with HEH configuration as illustrated in Fig. 2.4a [15].
</p>
<p>Among fixed-frequency HEHs, Ali et al. reached the greatest power output of 27.56
</p>
<p>mW [32]. It is then followed by 10.7 mW via Sang et al. HEH [21], both of HEHs
</p>
<p>share the similar configuration as in Fig. 2.1c, Sang et al. HEH has almost the half
</p>
<p>device volume of Ali et al. HEH as well as applying below half of the input
</p>
<p>excitation.
</p>
<p>Shan et al. [16] and Ab Rahman et al. [20, 34] HEHs are around similar power
</p>
<p>generation levels of 4.25, 5.7 and 5.8 mW, respectively. For broadband HEHs to
</p>
<p>achieve similar power levels, the device volume expands approximately ten times
</p>
<p>with and exception of Xu et al. nonlinear HEH (Fig. 2.1a) having almost the same
</p>
<p>device volume with Ab Rahman et al. HEH [40]. Table 2.1 also indicates that
</p>
<p>four-pole arrangements [20, 34] are always superior to Ab Rahman et al. two-pole
</p>
<p>arrangement [20].
</p>
<p>Finally, the lowest power outputs belongs to Xu et al. [31] and Wischke et al.
</p>
<p>(Fig. 2.2b) [25, 39]. However, Xu et al. fixed-band HEH volume is also the smallest
</p>
<p>device volume in Table 2.1, whereas Wischke et al. tunable HEH owns the second
</p>
<p>biggest device volume.

<p>2.4 Novel HEH Systems
</p>
<p>While stand-alone systems are generally bound to be limited by one power source,
</p>
<p>multimode designs offer never-ending possibilities. Especially, when multi-source
</p>
<p>powered EHing concept is included as well as multimode HEHs, designs turn out to
</p>
<p>be novel. In this section, vibrational HEH novel designs are covered along with
</p>
<p>multiple vibration source harvesting, two and three multi-source powered har-
</p>

<p>2 Hybrid Energy Harvesters (HEHs)&mdash;A Review 27</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.4.1 Fixed-Frequency Single-Source Powered HEHs
</p>
<p>As a preliminary study, Reuschel et al. proposed axial flux and radial flux
</p>
<p>arrangements, where set of opposite pole magnets aligned radially in a radial coil
</p>
<p>house, designing EMH and PE cantilever modeling for the proposed arrangements.
</p>
<p>They announce to combine both transducers and analyze HEH as a whole system
</p>
<p>[43].
</p>
<p>Harvesting from human motion is a demanded research subject especially to
</p>
<p>power personal electronics. Wei and Ramasamy studied harvesting kinesiology and
</p>
<p>it is shown that the HEH is suitable to feed personal electronics and charged mobile
</p>
<p>phone in experiments. The mechanical harvesting part composed of flywheel and in
</p>
<p>each footfall, it runs the shaft connected to one-third of diameter of the actual
</p>
<p>wheel. Two piezoelectric configurations researched for shoe insole and it is seen
</p>
<p>that rolled piezoelectric plate is placed in shoe sole. It is seen that though this HEH
</p>
<p>is slow to charge mobile phone for being able to charge about 10% in 30 min, it is
</p>
<p>also found that starting from half-fully charged phone. The user can end up with
</p>
<p>70% of charge with HEH, whereas without any harvester, charge level would be
</p>
<p>16%. Authors assume the potential over one-million personal usages of their har-
</p>
<p>vester. In this case, they foreseen the total power generation of 60,000 kW h [1].
</p>
<p>Halim et al. unique components turns classic HEH into novel one. The main
</p>
<p>harvester body is almost same with the illustration in Fig. 2.4 on the right. Novel
</p>
<p>parts are the parabolic top of the tip mass, which is intended to move vertically by
</p>
<p>the non-magnetic ball action during horizontal input excitations (see Fig. 2.5). This
</p>
<p>mechanism also leads vertical PE bimorph displacement at center and EM induction
</p>
<p>with magnet attachment. This design is aimed to harvest human motion, thus
</p>
<p>shaken manually by hand at around 5 Hz during experiments. Resulted frequency
</p>
<p>responses of EM and PE transducers show that the first mode is at 816 Hz for both
</p>
<p>parts. Optimum power generation performances are 0.64 mW for EM part and 0.98
</p>
<p>mW for PE part of HEH system [14].
</p>
<p>2.4.2 Broadband Single-Source Powered HEHs
</p>
<p>Linear Novel HEHs: Castagnetti&rsquo;s novel HEH is one of the most innovative one
</p>
<p>as well possessing 60 Hz-bandwidth. The design concept is composed of Belleville
</p>
<p>springs (B1 and B2 in Fig. 2.6b and c) and three different case of EM part for
</p>
<p>having a single magnet as in Fig. 2.6a, 2 magnets (Fig. 2.6c) and four magnets
</p>
<p>configurations. The vertical frame in (a) is shown horizontally in (c), denoted by
</p>
<p>&ldquo;F&rdquo;. Experiments conducted for three cases of HEHs at 1 g and 19.62 m/s2. Input
</p>
<p>acceleration of 19.62 m/s2 yield greater power outputs at resonance frequency.
</p>
<p>Among HEHs, the generated power of four-magnet HEH is 2 times of two-pole
</p>
<p>magnet HEH and 8 times of single magnet HEH. The four-magnet HEH
</p>
<p>28 N. Gure et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>configuration produced the greater power of 15.31 mW and enables broadband
</p>
<p>operation from 120 to 180 Hz at 2 g. Castagnetti also reported their HEH is
</p>
<p>superior than commercial products like Perpetuum in terms of power generation
</p>
<p>and band-width [35].
</p>
<p>Non-linear Novel HEHs: Karami and Inman presented mono and bistable non-
</p>
<p>linear thus, broadband novel HEH, as seen in Fig. 2.7. As the horizontal input
</p>
<p>excitation is applied, then, the tip magnet moves harmonically. This oscillation
</p>
<p>yields EM and PE energy generation. HEH magnets are aligned with opposite
</p>
<p>polarization and these magnets&rsquo; distance is arranged such that the HEH can perform
</p>
<p>as mono or bistable but nonlinear unless the gap is set to 50 mm in order to see
</p>
<p>linear system performance. Additionally, the system behaves as linear at low input
</p>
<p>base excitation and nonlinear at greater acceleration inputs. The best power output
</p>
<p>results are close to 35 lW for EM transducer and 1.5 mW for PE part at 1.7 m/s2. It
</p>
<p>is worth to mentioned that linear dynamics of these HEH systems at low excitations
</p>
<p>[44, 45] are overcome by Leadenham and Erturk&rsquo;s M-shaped PEH design [46].

<p>2.4.3 Multimode and Multisource Powered HEHs
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;multimode EH&rdquo; refers larger literature than &ldquo;hybrid EH&rdquo;. Further,
</p>
<p>multimode and multisource power terms are used in title to imply that novel
</p>
<p>researches of the extreme levels of hybridization of harvesters, multi-vibrational
</p>
<p>power source types (Sect. 2.4.3.1) and multi-power source inputs (Sects. 2.4.3.2,
</p>
<p>2.4.3.3 and 2.4.3.4) are reviewed in this part.
</p>
<p>2.4.3.1 Hybrid Rotary-Translational Harvesters (HRTHs)
</p>
<p>The characteristics of motion highly affect the harvester design. Unlike the
</p>
<p>excitement types so far, two axes translational and rotary motions are the realistic
</p>
<p>cases of vibration inputs as in kinesiology and rotary machines. All these and
</p>
<p>chaotic or random and varying excitations lead broadband methods, among these,
</p>
<p>manual tuning is preferably employed for simplicity. However, as an alternative,
</p>
<p>different types of random motions can be scavenged without active physical input
</p>
<p>and it is known as &ldquo;automatic generating system (AGS)&rdquo; under the Kinetic brand.
</p>
<p>One classic commonly known commercial example is SEIKO wristwatches.
</p>
<p>Harmonic movement of the rotor drives the gear train and eventually almost 100
</p>
<p>times of the eccentric mass rotational speed is converted to run the EM generator (at
</p>
<p>5&ndash;15 krpm for 50 ms). In 1988, the device average power output range was 5&ndash;10
</p>
<p>lW and in 1996 it was 10 lW when worn, 1 mW when shaken with a maximum
</p>
<p>capacity of 10 mW [47&ndash;51]. Sasaki et al. researched this HRTH and analyzed
</p>
<p>damping, self excited rotation and swinging motions as indicated in Fig. 2.8b.
</p>
<p>Electric load connection on generator causes rotor axis damping to increase up to
</p>
<p>some limit for self-excited rotation mode. This electromechanical damping limit is a
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.7 Karami and Inman&rsquo;s design illustration and prototype [44, 45]
</p>
<p>2 Hybrid Energy Harvesters (HEHs)&mdash;A Review 31</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>bit greater than 10&minus;4 Nms/rad. Self excited rotation reaches its maximum value of
</p>
<p>10 mW at this point and as damping increases further, sudden decline in power
</p>
<p>generation occurs down to 1 mW and the mode turns into swinging motion. This
</p>
<p>indicated that power generation in self-excited rotation is 10 times greater than
</p>
<p>swinging mode. In the light of these findings, AGS is better at low frequency and
</p>
<p>large amplitude inputs like walking or running [48].
</p>
<p>For medical implants, this HRTH is experimentally tested on the right ventric-
</p>
<p>ular wall of the dog&rsquo;s heart. Test results are 13 &micro;J per heartbeat, and 80 mJ in
</p>
<p>30 min (44 lW), yet never further tested to feed aimed application of heart-pace
</p>
<p>since less power is produced than needed 200 mJ per half an hour. This design&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>feasibility on pacemakers further studied: This harvester mechanism is placed on
</p>
<p>the surface of a human chest and performance tested in office activity. In 8 h,
</p>
<p>multi-mode harvester generated 0.5 lW, which is much less than peacemaker
</p>
<p>battery recharge feed [50]. Related to Sasaki et al. conclusion on AGS, high
</p>
<p>amplitude is necessary for greater power outputs. Hence, office environment does
</p>
<p>not provide this vibration input as in running. However, generated power in office is
</p>
<p>sufficient enough to run wristwatches.

<p>Karami and Inman, investigated, modeled and simulated nonlinear HRTH in
</p>
<p>order to enlarge operation bandwidth. This design has magnetic pendulum as an
</p>
<p>eccentric mass connected to DC motor shaft and generates power from DC motor as
</p>
<p>the magnet oscillates (Fig. 2.9). In case of full rotation is passed, the resulted
</p>
<p>vibration is either two period vibration or chaotic. As the vertical base acceleration
</p>
<p>increases from 1 g up to 1000 g, power output rises from 10 mW to 1 W. While the
</p>
<p>base frequency increases up to 10 Hz, the output power is almost the same around 1
</p>
<p>mW, after 20 Hz, logarithmically increases maximum of 0.5 mW, which is the
</p>
<p>saturation value at 90 Hz. The multiplicity of these findings gave maximum power
</p>
<p>generation of about 70 mW. The analytic calculations of power generations are
</p>
<p>much higher than the alternative proposed HRTHs, which is highly favorable in
</p>
<p>applications like tires and wind turbine blades [51].
</p>
<p>Jung Kim Min et al. are especially designed HRTH for low frequency and
</p>
<p>structural applications. The complete HRTH design is shown in Figs. 2.10 and
</p>
<p>2.11c as Case 3. The whole system is separately analyzed and tested for three cases
</p>
<p>of harvester components. The first case (Fig. 2.11a) is EM transducer where same
</p>
<p>pole magnet movement results in EM induction. In case 2 (Fig. 2.11b), as the beam
</p>
<p>oscillates, it is transformed into rotational motion and similar to Karami and Inman
</p>
<p>design, this rotation input yields power generation by DC motor. When all the
</p>
<p>harvesting mechanisms are gathered, there exists another implementation for the
</p>
<p>permanent magnets to oscillate in boundary limits so that the efficiency can be
</p>
<p>increased and since the beam is not fixed or not able to complete full rotation.
</p>
<p>Therefore, In case 3, the mechanical stoppers are added to both oscillation radial
</p>
<p>clockwise and counter-clockwise directions as seen in Fig. 2.11. In experiments, all
</p>
<p>cases are tested at constant input excitation of 0.03 g and the frequency is shifted
</p>

<p>from 0.5 to 5 Hz. Frequency response showed that the resonance frequency of all
</p>
<p>cases is almost at 1 Hz and output power of the system in Case 2 that is power
</p>
<p>generated by the motor with the gear ratio of 10:1, overwhelms the generation in
</p>
<p>Case 1. As a result, the harvester power generation of 37 mW is mostly contributed
</p>
<p>by the second case [52].
</p>
<p>Larkin and Tadesse&rsquo;s novel design is composed of 3 HEH cantilevers in
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.1a mounted onto rotation center and a circular coil house (Fig. 2.12). The 3
</p>
<p>HEH cantilever acts as eccentric mass and in addition to operation modes are shown
</p>
<p>at the bottom of Fig. 2.8, PE beams allow harvesting perpendicular translational
</p>
<p>forces. To sum up, the operation modes are rotational, and translational in both
</p>
<p>vertical and horizontal axes in 1&ndash;10 Hz with a maximum of 30 Hz operation range.
</p>
<p>Combined PE generator output power was 332 &micro;W at 5 Hz and 0.8 g input exci-
</p>
<p>tation, and 1.25 mW at 20.6 Hz and 0.6 g vibration input. Other experiments cover
</p>
<p>testing at two body levels (wrist and ankle) when the device is placed horizontally
</p>
<p>(normal to gravitational axis, Fig. 2.12d and f) and vertically (in line with gravi-
</p>
<p>tational axis for walking, walk with spinning and jogging, Fig. 2.12e). The best
</p>
<p>performances respective to EM and PE generators are 17 at mW vertical placement
</p>
<p>on the wrist, and 759 &micro;W at ankle while jogging. For both transduction mecha-
</p>
<p>nisms, lowest performances are observed for horizontal placement on the wrist with
</p>
<p>walking alone. The reason for vertical placement to produce greater powers is that

<p>In addition to combination of multiple transducers for EHing in HEHs concept,
</p>
<p>the other phenomenon is to harvest multiple power sources with either single or

<p>connected in series for vibrational EHing and in parallel for RF EHing in the axial

<p>orientation to the source antenna as seen in the bottom in Fig. 2.14. The interesting
</p>
<p>finding was that the voltage differences between 1.52 V for coil 1 only and 1.32 V
</p>
<p>for coil 1 and 2 connected in parallel. Hehr et al. explains the reason as the
</p>
<p>indication of RF interface between the coils. At 1 g and 12.5 Hz, EM generator
</p>
<p>output energy is 1 J in *90 s namely, *11 mW. At 2.46 GHz, RF generator
</p>
<p>produces 70 mJ of energy in 100 s in other words, 0.7 mW [57].
</p>
<p>Collado and Georgiadis also comprised unusual two energy sources of solar and
</p>
<p>electromagnetic waves in a single device. Novelty of their research is not limited to
</p>
<p>these harvesting sources but also include the HEH design in Fig. 2.15, developed
</p>
<p>low cost and efficient solar cells, maximized power point tracking and low power
</p>
<p>DC/DC converter to fix DC voltage. Collado and Georgiadis&rsquo;s novel HEH design is
</p>
<p>based on broadband monopole rectifying antenna on flexible polyethylene
</p>
<p>terephthalate (PET) substrate structure and on top of the antenna, flexible hydro-
</p>
<p>genated amorphous silicon (A-Si) solar panel is thin solar cell arrays are imple-
</p>
<p>mented (Fig. 2.15). The antenna alone is the copper layer of 35 lm covering a PET
</p>
<p>substrate of 75 lm. In contrast to Hehr et al., authors aimed to harvest broadband
</p>
<p>range of 800 MHz to 6 GHz so that dissipated wide range of standard communi-
</p>
<p>cation bands can be harvested. Solar array integration was chosen such that the RF
</p>
<p>harvesting performance will not be affected. Thus the experiments conducted at a
</p>
<p>distance of 3.45 m from the transmitter, which transmits RF power less than

<p>solar cell integration. For solar and RF HEH, the illumination was set almost to
</p>
<p>standard global solar irradiance of 100 and 15 mW/cm2 for shade simulation. With
</p>
<p>respect to the stated illuminations, the voltage outputs of the solar array are 4.06 V
</p>
<p>and 3.90 mV. It is seen that EH with and without solar cells generates similar
</p>
<p>voltage trend and amount just as the radius of 10 and 7 mm prototypes resulted, yet
</p>
<p>10 mm radii prototype generates slightly higher voltage at 850 and 1850 MHz.
</p>
<p>Collado and Georgiadis concluded that the best performance of the HEH is able to
</p>
<p>generate 56 mW [58, 59].
</p>
<p>Resembling Gambier et al. novel multi source powered HEH [56], Chatterjee
</p>
<p>and Bryant&rsquo;s HEH harnesses solar and wind flow or vibration type kinetic powers.
</p>
<p>Only Chatterjee and Bryant state possible application of HEHs on mobile robots.
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 2.16, the PE patches are laminated underneath flexible thin film
</p>
<p>solar ribbon with very low aspect ratio. HEH is fixed in both ends and during
</p>
<p>longitudinal tension; transverse wind flow is induced to form aeroelastic vibration.
</p>
<p>In spite of setting the test set up, in Chatterjee and Bryant&rsquo;s paper, authors only
</p>
<p>proposed theoretical modeling and tuning via changing the longitudinal tension.
</p>
<p>They concluded that the transverse matrix methods is superior over Bokaikan
</p>
<p>method, where as the stress is reduced, the power generation of PE patches also
</p>
<p>reduces while being almost ineffective on mode shapes, yet effective on the mode
</p>
<p>shape of the structure without the PE patches [60].

<p>During experiments, hand induced rotation supplied to HEH and successfully lit 40
</p>
<p>LEDs and a globe light with a maximum illumination up to 1700 lux (Figs. 2.17
</p>
<p>and 2.18). At a rate of 200 rpm, HEH generates *8.4 mW by EM part and 8.4 mW
</p>
<p>by TENG part. Under optimum loads of 1 and 2 kX, respective power generations
</p>
<p>by EM and TENG transducers are 50 and 17 mW [61].
</p>
<p>Microscale Examples: Yu et al. investigated the combination of solar panels for
</p>
<p>low illumination and MEM vibrational EH. Similar to Collado and Georgiadis, Yu
</p>
<p>et al. also selected A-Si solar panel with a surface area of 9.6 cm2 since it is suitable
</p>
<p>for indoor light (fluorescent or LED). When authors&rsquo; five-parameter modeling
</p>
<p>simulations of solar power generations are compared with the experiments, their
</p>
<p>modeling is closer to the experimental measurements and thus, more accurate than
</p>
<p>traditional models. The maximum power output is 110 lW at 530 lux. Microscopic
</p>
<p>scale vibrational EH is composed of five PZT beam array connected in series with a

<p>Jeon et al. not only propose a novel multi source powered HEH but also solves
</p>
<p>the cleaning need of the solar cells and thus, keep its efficiency stable by the second
</p>
<p>power source of raindrops. In addition contact electrification by mechanic input,
</p>
<p>water solid interactions are also enough to harness energy via TENGs. Transparent
</p>
<p>and superhydrophobic TENGs with small contact angle allows water droplets to
</p>
<p>remove particles on the surface as well providing light to transmit and reach to the
</p>
<p>solar cells. In Fig. 2.19b, transparent superhydrophobic PDMS and ITO-PEN
</p>
<p>substrate layers on solar cells, and the prototype (below) are demonstrated.
</p>
<p>Throughout the experiments conducted with distilled water, raw tap water, actual
</p>
<p>rain, 0.01 and 1 M NaCl solutions. The resulted power generation is in the same
</p>
<p>order of the tested solutions regarding the highest to lowest power generation.
</p>
<p>While in the real rain case the output power is decreased, it is almost negligible
</p>
<p>especially the standard deviations are considered. Jeon et al. multi-function HEH
</p>
<p>generated maximum power output of 0.27 lW [63].
</p>
<p>Novelty of Zakharov et al. study is to harness thermal energy via PE transducer
</p>
<p>due to the resulted mechanical deformation. Their design couples shape memory
</p>
<p>effect (SME) and direct piezoelectric effect (DPE). However, proposed novel har-
</p>
<p>vester is partially HEH since the direct main source is thermal and the second
</p>
<p>source is indirect mechanical deformation, caused by the thermal input (Fig. 2.20)

</p>

<p>The developed system runs against low wind speeds due to PAGV integration
</p>
<p>(Fig. 2.21) [65, 66].
</p>
<p>De et al. also studied wind-solar hybrid EH. Their so-called &ldquo;WiSH&rdquo; system
</p>
<p>consists horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) having 500 W rotor and solar PV
</p>
<p>panels with 250 W capacity so that the energy production can be increased during

<p>low wind speed regimes in India. HAWTs have two types; having 3 blades and 4
</p>
<p>blades. Each blade weighs about 600 g and to achieve this low weight and high
</p>
<p>strength, they are made of carbon fiber composite. Performance curves gained from
</p>
<p>mobile testing indicated that fabricated 4-blade HAWT is more efficient than
</p>
<p>3-bladed one. Prototypes of WiSH systems are installed in Kodihalli Campus, India
</p>
<p>for field tests (Fig. 2.22). Both 4 bladed HAWTs are parallel and 30 m-high. With

<p>the help of industrial partnership of ARES, prototypes developed up to 1&ndash;5 kW

<p>and the respective wind generator maximum output powers are 3.1, 5, and 7.7 mW.
</p>
<p>Solar cell and wind harvester experimental results are very close to simulation
</p>
<p>findings. As a final component, fuel cell EH with 3.61 cm2 area, power generation
</p>
<p>is around 1 mW [68].
</p>
<p>Zheng et al. are researched a pretty novel application of single improved dual
</p>
<p>mode TENG in such a way to harness raindrop and wind energies, and combined it
</p>
<p>with solar EHing. The very similar structure is in Jean et al. HEH as demonstrated in
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.19b. Zheng et al. also used the transparent superhydrophobic TENG with a
</p>
<p>40 cm2 surface area on silicon-based solar cells. TENG&rsquo;s transparency is validated by
</p>
<p>spectra transmittance test as being more transparent even than a 3 mm-thick com-
</p>
<p>mercial glass. Moreover, separation of polytetrafluoroethylene and nylon layers by
</p>
<p>PET spacer border enhances dual mode of TENG (fabrication and experiments of
</p>
<p>HEH components are given in detail in Zheng et al. article). These dual modes are:
</p>
<p>water contact TENG as rain EH and the wind contact TENG as wind EH. The tests are
</p>
<p>set as such: Rainy day conditions are considered (13.6 and 20 mL/s dripping rates)
</p>
<p>and the incident angle between raindrops and TENG surface is 45&deg;, with a distance of
</p>
<p>40 cm from the rain shower. Common daily wind speeds of 1.7; 2.7; 4.1 and 4.9 m/s
</p>
<p>are flowed from a faucet and the solar irradiation is set to 100 mW/cm2. At 20 mL/s
</p>
<p>dripping rate, water TENG, water contact TENG andHEH drive 10, 20 and 50 LEDs,
</p>
<p>respectively. Experiments have shown that the dual-mode TENG (water and water
</p>
<p>contact TENGs are in series) voltage and current densities are greater than water
</p>
<p>contact TENG that is greater than water TENG alone. Generated power of the pro-
</p>
<p>totype is limited but since the size can be expanded, generated powers in per square
</p>
<p>meter of the HEH surface area are more representative as in current densities, thus, for
</p>
<p>HEH it is 86 mW/m2 at a dripping rate of 13.6 mL/s and in the absence of solar and
</p>
<p>rain sources, it is 8 mW/m2 from wind at a speed of 2.7 m/s [70].
</p>
<p>Microscale Examples: Chung et al. combined thermal, mechanical and magnetic
</p>
<p>powers in such a novel way. As mentioned in two-multi source powered HEHs title
</p>
<p>for Zakharov et al. 2015-design, in 2012, Chung et al. also used indirect source of
</p>
<p>magnetism to harness direct thermal power source. So, Chung et al. device is
</p>
<p>partially three-source powered HEH. As seen in the prototype picture in Fig. 2.24a,
</p>
<p>main body is copper-beryllium spring and the PE cantilever is both fixed to glass
</p>
<p>frame and attached to the spring. Design has two types of magnets: Moving
</p>
<p>gadolinium soft-magnet on top of spring and fixed neodymium-iron-boron
</p>
<p>hard-magnet on frame. The working principle of this novel HEH demonstrated in
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.24b and c: As the soft magnet is cooled below Curie temperature, it gains
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic property and almost attaches to the fixed hard magnet (b), which
</p>
<p>bends the spring and PEH. Worth to mention that magnets never really touch due to
</p>
<p>the distance between them in y direction. As the topside is cooled down (15 &deg;C) and
</p>
<p>heated (27 &deg;C), magnetic attraction incidence and withdrawal of the magnetic
</p>
<p>attraction leads spring, thus, PE beam oscillation and power generation. Second
</p>
<p>working mode is classic vibrational spring-proof mass energy generation on PEHs.
</p>
<p>Final creative additional working mode is the oscillation of the soft magnet on
</p>
<p>spring due to the induced AC magnetic field in z direction (c) [69].

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Chung et al. experiments resulted as: For temperature-difference-driven thermal
</p>
<p>EHing, a 25 &deg;C difference lead minimum and maximum of 15 and 70 peak-to-peak
</p>
<p>voltages, respectively. Generated peak-to-peak voltage outputs are 175 and 20 mV
</p>
<p>with respect to the input excitation of 1 mm at 46 Hz, and ACmagnetic field of &plusmn;3.5
</p>
<p>Oe at 43 Hz. The preliminary results clearly indicate that the vibrational energy
</p>
<p>generation is undoubtedly greater than other working modes [69]. Almost the same
</p>
<p>research team; Chen et al. took further to analyze their novel design (Fig. 2.25) [71].
</p>
<p>Chen et al. simplified their previous study by using gadolinium soft-magnet as a
</p>
<p>fixed beam on PZT sheet and silicon clamps and keeping the same fixed
</p>
<p>neodymium-iron-boron hard-magnet on frame. Experimental measurements are

</p>
<p>is and average power density is *1.37 nW with an average of *3.96 pW with the
</p>
<p>breakthrough HEH volume of about 0.063 cm3 [71].
</p>
<p>Large Scale Examples: Chong et al. presented VAWT, solar energy converter and
</p>
<p>rainwater collection systems integration with PAGV. Since the rainwater collection
</p>
<p>system is not an EH, it is only for storage purpose and indirectly saving energy from
</p>
<p>the reduced pumping need [72, 73] so their design is partially three-source powered
</p>
<p>HEH. Nevertheless, as Mithra et al. suggested in their research, it is also possible to
</p>
<p>harness energy from rainwater by increasing its kinetic energy from falling and the
</p>
<p>use of turbines [55]. As seen in their patent scheme in Fig. 2.26a&ndash;c, the wind
</p>
<p>turbine &lsquo;A&rsquo; is placed in the middle of the structure with rudder &lsquo;C&rsquo;, PAGV &lsquo;B&rsquo; has
</p>
<p>sloped upper &lsquo;D&rsquo; and lower &lsquo;E&rsquo; wall ducts, and surrounded by the protective mesh
</p>
<p>&lsquo;M&rsquo;. The upper wall duct also acts as a collector of the rain shower and at the same
</p>
<p>time, having solar energy converter (PV and/or solar thermal panel or solar con-
</p>
<p>centrator system) &lsquo;F&rsquo; on the upper surface. The captured rainwater after filter &lsquo;N&rsquo;
</p>
<p>flows through the passage &lsquo;G&rsquo; and reach to the storage &lsquo;K&rsquo;, which has thermal
</p>
<p>insulation at the base &lsquo;L&rsquo; so that heat transfer into building can be blocked. VAWT
</p>
<p>power drive shaft &lsquo;H&rsquo; is connected to the generator &lsquo;I&rsquo; via mechanical drive box &lsquo;J&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Their design is open to many modifications and one is illustrated in Fig. 2.26b.
</p>
<p>Tests conducted with and without 3-blade Sistan rotor having 0.5 m diameter and
</p>
<p>0.25 m height, surrounded by the PAGV having 30 m diameter. Pilot-scale test set
</p>
<p>up height from the PAGV to base is 12 m. It is reported that PAGV amplifies the
</p>
<p>wind speed by *1.8 times (46 rpm for pilot tests) and VAWT gains direct flow
</p>
<p>angle. It is seen that PAVG integration increases energy generation by 1.25 times. It
</p>
<p>is estimated that for the system on a 220 m high skyscraper, energy generations of
</p>
<p>the wind energy harvester system is approximately 157 and 58.4 MW h/year, solar
</p>
<p>panels with a 650 m2 active area is 280 kW h/day, and monthly the energy saving
</p>
<p>for 220 m pumped domestic water is 79 kW h. Ultimately, Chong et al. research

<p>east to west. PEH is selected as PZT (lead zirconium titanate) and connected in
</p>
<p>series. Measured maximum output power and peak-to-peak voltage of solar panel
</p>
<p>and PE are 10 W and 12 V, respectively. Authors propose wind turbine analytic
</p>
<p>modeling but do not mention the value of the potential power generation [75].
</p>
<p>Mithra et al. combined the classic rainwater, solar and wind harvesting systems.
</p>
<p>Rainwater harvesting starts from the collection of the rainfall on the roof of a
</p>
<p>three-floor, *9 m high building to the header tank. The water falls from the conduits,
</p>
<p>which increase pressure thus, velocity. At the base the falling water meets the turbine
</p>
<p>and its shaft is connected to alternator&rsquo;s rotor. After the rainwater hits the turbine
</p>
<p>blades it is collected and stored for further use, while the generated power is used to
</p>
<p>feed first of all power electronics and then, power systems. Based on this plot scale
</p>
<p>findings, the desired real-life application&rsquo;s evaluated electricity production is stated as
</p>
<p>1.53 kW h for 7 m high normal house and 290 kWh for 98 m skyscrapers. Classic
</p>
<p>Solar PV arrays and wind turbine to harvest wind energy are suggested to meet
</p>
<p>domestic power consumption. Nonetheless, Mithra et al. have not stated pilot scale
</p>
<p>tests along with rainwater system. The combination of mentioned generation systems
</p>
<p>are concluded as: The rainwater and wind power generations are rectified by AC-DC
</p>
<p>converters and the PV power alone is converted to fix DC voltage by chopper. The
</p>
<p>control unit combines these three different generated energies as a hybrid system [55].
</p>
<p>2.4.3.4 Four-Multi Source Powered HEH
</p>
<p>After Porcarelli et al. another attempt to research solar, wind and fuel cell EHs are
</p>
<p>studied by Saini et al. with an additional novel segment of electrolyzer (Fig. 2.27).
</p>
<p>Saini et al. uses solar, airflow, water, and produced hydrogen and oxygen as a result
</p>
<p>of electrolysis. HEH solar module is 95 � 135 � 30 mm3 in dimension, 89 g of
</p>
<p>weight and the maximum PV power generation is *190mWwhen exposed to single
</p>
<p>75 W lamp at 90&deg;. Six blade HAWT and the maximum output power is 400 mW.
</p>
<p>2 Hybrid Energy Harvesters (HEHs)&mdash;A Review 49</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Electrolyzer is the basis of fuel cell for decomposing water into hydrogen and oxy-
</p>
<p>gen. Afterwards, produced hydrogen and oxygen is used by fuel cell and increases
</p>
<p>the total source number up to four. Electrolyzer dimensions are 50 � 40 � 57 mm3
</p>
<p>and the generator is 54 g in weight with a decomposition voltage of 1.5 V in practice.
</p>
<p>Final harvester component of fuel cell is selected as proton exchange membrane and
</p>
<p>as a 5-fuel cell set, it is 60 � 70 � 175 mm3 in volume and 430 g in weight.
</p>
<p>Four-multi source powered HEH maximum output power is 315 mW [2].
</p>
<p>2.4.4 Overall Novel HEHs Comparison
</p>
<p>The reviewed novel HEH systems peak power generations, total harvester com-
</p>
<p>ponent volumes and/or active surface areas device masses, input excitations, input
</p>
<p>frequencies and half power band width ranges are compared in Tables 2.2 and 2.3.

<p>2 Hybrid Energy Harvesters (HEHs)&mdash;A Review 55</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Table 2.2 covers fixed-frequency and broadband single-source powered HEHs and
</p>
<p>multimode HRTHs in Sects. 2.4.1, 2.4.2 and 2.4.3.1. Table 2.3 emphasizes micro-,
</p>
<p>meso-, and large-scale based comparisons of two-, three- and four-multisource
</p>
<p>powered HEHs in Sects. 2.4.3.2, 2.4.3.3 and 2.4.3.4. The given device volume and
</p>
<p>surface areas are the conservative values of the HEHs, and generally belong to
</p>
<p>transducer parts and active surface areas. The overall novel HEHs comparisons are
</p>
<p>evaluated in Sect. 2.5.
</p>
<p>2.5 Conclusions
</p>
<p>The need to achieve greater power generation leads researchers to investigate
</p>
<p>hybridization of EHing transduction mechanisms, working modes and source
</p>
<p>powers. As indicated in literature [10&ndash;23], in the scope of this chapter review, it is
</p>
<p>seen that HEHs generate greater power outputs than their single harvester
</p>
<p>components.
</p>
<p>Among classic HEHs, Table 2.1 shows that Shan et al. HEH holds the greatest
</p>
<p>power output of 33 mW along with broadband performance in the range of 7 to
</p>
<p>17 Hz [16]. Regarding the device volume, Ali et al. holds greater power density
</p>
<p>than Shan et al. [32]. Once PE and EM power generations are compared, generally,
</p>
<p>EM power generations are lower than PE parts with an only exception of Ab
</p>
<p>Rahman et al. HEH with four pole magnet arrangement [20, 34]. Apart from
</p>
<p>Wischke et al. microscale HEH, Xu et al. device [31] has the lowest energy gen-
</p>
<p>eration with the minimum volume of 187.2 [31].
</p>
<p>In novel HEH class, the most promising power generations are proposed by Yu
</p>
<p>et al. [62] in microscale, Saini et al. [2] and Karami and Inman [51] in meso-scale,
</p>
<p>and Chang et al. [72, 73] in large scale HEHs. Broadband technique significantly
</p>
<p>increases output power and density in nonlinear designs [44, 45]. In case of linear
</p>
<p>HEHs, Halim et al. novel design suppresses power density of Castagnetti&rsquo;s HEH
</p>
<p>[35] about 5 times, but not the bandwidth [14]. Within HRTHs, best performance is
</p>
<p>achieved by Karami and Inman with an average power output of 70 mW and
</p>
<p>maximum of 1 W when exposed to 1000 g [51]. However, Jung et al. managed to
</p>
<p>produce 37 mW at low excitation as much as 0.03 g [52]. At almost the same
</p>
<p>device size with Jung et al. Larkin and Tadesse gained more than 17 mW during
</p>
<p>jogging activity on wrist placement [24, 54] (see Table 2.2). In micro-scale HEH
</p>
<p>class, Wischke et al. managed to gain the highest output power of 215 lW via
</p>
<p>tuning in broadband operation, yet the total harvester volume is much greater [25,
</p>
<p>39] than remaining prototypes. The closest result of 177 lW is reached by Yu et al.
</p>
<p>by solar and vibration powered HEH with a surface area of *1 cm2 [62]. The
</p>
<p>smallest size prototype with 13.4 mm2 surface area is fabricated and tested by Jeon
</p>
<p>et al. and it produces 0.27 lW of output power [63]. Comparison of mesoscale
</p>
<p>novel HEHs emphasize that four-source powered HEH produces the greatest power
</p>
<p>output of 315 mW, whereas occupying the greatest volume [2]. It is seen that
</p>
<p>two-multisource powered HEHs produce greater power than three-multisource
</p>
<p>56 N. Gure et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>powered ones without an exception. Collado and Georgiadis proved that RF and
</p>
<p>solar HEH are able to harness 56 mW of power with a small volume of 4 cm3 [58,
</p>
<p>59]. Regardless of the device size, Zhong et al. hand induced hybrid TENG and EM
</p>
<p>harvester generates total of 67 mW of power [61]. Lastly, large-scale HEHs result
</p>
<p>the best when implemented on high buildings such as skyscrapers. The greatest
</p>
<p>energy generation is estimated for solar and airflow harvesting along with rainwater
</p>
<p>storage, which saves pumping cost and eventually serves a total of 440 kW h of
</p>
<p>surplus energy daily [72, 73] (Table 2.3).
</p>
<p>Among overall reviewed classic and novel HEHs, the peak power of 1 W is
</p>
<p>achieved by Karami and Inman at an extreme excitation of 1000 g, yet reasonable
</p>
<p>daily conditions are enough for the generation of 315 mW by Saini et al.
</p>
<p>four-source powered novel HEH. Regarding the size of HEHs, Collado and
</p>
<p>Georgiadis&rsquo; two-source powered HEH generates the highest output power of 56
</p>
<p>mW. The most promising power generations are achieved by Saini et al.

</p>
<p>Abstract Continually growing integration levels and miniaturization in electronics
</p>
<p>has led to the enrichment of features to enable a variety of new applications with
</p>
<p>simultaneous reduction in system power consumption. The start of the 21st century
</p>
<p>is hallmarked by the emergence of small information engines (microsystems) as
</p>
<p>part of &ldquo;internet of things&rdquo; thrust to provide the intelligence behind the building
</p>
<p>blocks of the increasingly automated, digitized, and connected eco-system around
</p>
<p>residential, industrial, health, education, transportation, communication, and other
</p>
<p>sectors of our civilization. These engines require small amount of power to work in
</p>
<p>an embedded environment where frequent access for maintenance, and power
</p>
<p>delivery or battery refurbishment is not desirable. The focus of this chapter is
</p>
<p>batteryless operation, which is at the center-stage of microscale harvesting research

<p>3.1 Micro-scale Energy Harvesting
</p>
<p>3.1.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The development of integrated microprocessor chip in 1971 was a key enabler for
</p>
<p>the Personal Computer (PC). Since then, Moore&rsquo;s Law has correctly predicted the
</p>
<p>seamless technology advancement of doubled transistor count on a chip about every
</p>
<p>two years, while the transistors themselves shrunk with every generation.
</p>
<p>Additional transistors with better power consumption characteristics were utilized
</p>
<p>by component and system architects to develop advanced features in electronic
</p>
<p>platforms, and by circuit designers to build faster circuits. More integration was
</p>
<p>achieved with every technology generation, which not only pulled down system
</p>
<p>cost through reduced number of components, but also lowered overall power dis-
</p>
<p>sipation due to the elimination of glue-logic between components, and the fact that
</p>
<p>each transistor could be switched on/off with less power. Computer quickly stopped
</p>
<p>being an expensive machine in a laboratory reserved for privileged scientists, and
</p>
<p>by 1990s marketing segmentation drove differentiation of computer systems to
</p>
<p>address emerging usage models, making computers available to virtually everyone.

<p>Some computers evolved into mobile productivity tools that travel along with us.
</p>
<p>Some turned into entertainment centers with emphasis on multi-media performance.
</p>
<p>Some continued their evolution on traditional high performance computing with the
</p>
<p>goal to achieve more scientific computations per unit time. Another important
</p>
<p>segment was enabled through simple-task dedicated &lsquo;small&rsquo; information engines
</p>
<p>shaping the building blocks of the progressively automated, digitized, and con-
</p>
<p>nected eco-system around all major application sectors such as residential, indus-
</p>
<p>trial, health, education, transportation, and communication. It was commonly
</p>
<p>accepted by the end of the 20th century that wireless machines and networks would
</p>
<p>have a fundamental role in intelligent system design. It has become clear ever since
</p>
<p>that 21st century is the era of internet of things (IoT) or &ldquo;internet of everything&rdquo;,
</p>
<p>meaning everything from small sensors to large machines get connected. These
</p>
<p>&ldquo;things&rdquo; make our life easier, and increase our productivity. The information,
</p>
<p>available at our finger tips, contributes to our health, comfort, safety, education,
</p>
<p>professional development. This realization quickly leads to the need for embedded
</p>
<p>applications without batteries i.e. longevity with minimum maintenance.
</p>
<p>Contemporary microsystems for handling information require features to
</p>
<p>dynamically trade off performance and power dissipation. Other simultaneously
</p>
<p>critical ingredients are long battery life, low energy operation, wireless communi-
</p>
<p>cation, compact, low cost, light platforms. Due to the recent emphasis on intelligent
</p>
<p>environment, small embedded systems with very low power consumption and
</p>
<p>longevity have become vital to the exponentially growing number of &lsquo;miniaturized
</p>
<p>and ubiquitous&rsquo; devices in the 21st century. Since good power and energy con-
</p>
<p>sumption characteristics have been the determinant for the success of new infor-
</p>
<p>mation engines, much engineering effort has been spent on various aspects of power
</p>
<p>management. Batteryless operation, however, continues to be a great challenge.
</p>
<p>Energy harvesting is thus introduced in this section as the means to achieve zero or
</p>
<p>close-to-zero average input power for green micro-scale IT (Information
</p>
<p>Technologies) of the future. Energy and power budgeting for such applications, the
</p>
<p>need for batteryless operation, consumption management and generation are cov-
</p>
<p>ered in the following discussion.
</p>
<p>3.1.2 Demand for Micro-scale Information Technologies
</p>
<p>Use of IT has been proven to increase productivity in organizations for the last few
</p>
<p>decades [1]. Tendency for decentralized or distributed operations, mobile lifestyles
</p>
<p>has naturally increased the demand for IT. In a recent white paper by Cisco,
</p>
<p>tremendous growth in demand for smartphones, tablets, and other mobile com-
</p>
<p>puting devices is projected. Average number of connected devices per capita is
</p>
<p>projected to grow from 2 to 3.2 in the period between 2014 and 2019. Particularly,
</p>
<p>machine-to-machine (M2M) connection is the fastest growing category as depicted
</p>
<p>in Fig. 3.1 [2].
</p>
<p>3 Micro-scale Energy Harvesting for Batteryless Information Technologies 65</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The reported trends further emphasize the forecasted growth in demand for
</p>
<p>smaller or micro-scale IT devices for applications with M2M connectivity to
</p>
<p>improve quality of daily services. The largest expected growth is in connected
</p>
<p>health sector, with compound annual growth rate close to 50% between 2014 and
</p>
<p>2019 [2]. Similarly, agriculture, construction, emergency services, and transporta-
</p>
<p>tion (cars) sectors are expected to experience a fast growth rate in the adoption of
</p>
<p>M2M connected devices. Sensing, digitization, processing, and communication are
</p>
<p>ubiquitously embedded into everyday objects, turning them into the IoT [3].
</p>
<p>Individual devices thus collaborate in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) across a
</p>
<p>variety of contexts to provide invaluable data and information on physical phe-
</p>
<p>nomena. The applications of such WSNs are widespread as summarized in Fig. 3.2.
</p>
<p>The generic WSN system architecture and requirements are outlined in Fig. 3.3.
</p>
<p>Many embedded sensors attached to the system have the most stringent power
</p>
<p>dissipation and energy requirements for sensing and transmission of data to the
</p>
<p>local HUB. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) components may be used for
</p>
<p>miniaturization of mechanical aspects of the sensor nodes. These nodes also contain
</p>
<p>some processing features implemented in application specific integrated circuit
</p>
<p>(ASIC) components in a subset of the applications of interest. Adding to these the
</p>
<p>size and cost constraints, and potentially dynamic, unfavorably out-of-touch
</p>
<p>physical environment, the sensor node system design becomes a challenging
</p>
<p>problem. The local processing and control hub follows a pre-programmed algorithm
</p>
<p>to collect data from a variety of sensors in the neighborhood (few meters to few
</p>
<p>kilometers as typical range), and may respond by activating various actuators in the
</p>
<p>intelligent system after processing the received information. A desirable feature of
</p>
<p>the WSN is the ability to communicate with cloud or servers over the internet for
</p>
<p>remote monitoring and control. This aspect further allows remote policies and user
</p>
<p>interfaces to be devised and implemented through software for a particular WSN.
</p>
<p>Considering transportation, for example, use of WSNs in aeronautical vehicles is
</p>
<p>an emerging trend. More than one thousand sensor nodes may potentially be uti-
</p>
<p>lized in an aircraft, for automation of flight attendant control panels, passenger
</p>
<p>services, cabin illumination, surveillance cameras, safety sensors (smoke, temper-
</p>
<p>ature, humidity), passenger entertainment, signs and various other controls [7]. It
</p>
<p>has become increasingly difficult to reliably wire signals and power lines to and
</p>
<p>from the sensors and actuators through the tight space available within the structure

<p>of the plane. As in the case of aircrafts, many uses of WSNs require accurate
</p>
<p>processing and delivery of data from one location to another, while at the same time
</p>
<p>satisfying strict system requirements related to power source, power consumption
</p>
<p>and size.

<p>3.1.3 Power and Energy Budgets
</p>
<p>Sensor nodes are either battery driven or are required to operate on energy scav-
</p>
<p>enged (harvested) from the environment. Hence, the energy budget is tight. The
</p>
<p>importance of optimizing design based on application needs cannot be stressed
</p>
<p>enough. Designs using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components are often
</p>
<p>disadvantaged in power consumption due to redundancy of features, and inter-
</p>
<p>connect. Custom integrated designs and system-on-chip (SOC) components on the
</p>
<p>other hand can potentially deliver minimum power for the application, but typically
</p>
<p>are subject to longer design, fabrication and test lead times, and higher unit costs for
</p>
<p>low volume operations.
</p>
<p>A typical architecture for wireless sensor nodes is depicted in Fig. 3.4. The
</p>
<p>voltage from the battery is converted to one or more voltage levels by DC/DC
</p>
<p>converter(s) to supply power to sensor(s), one or more analog-to-digital converters
</p>
<p>(ADCs), microcontroller unit (MCU), a memory if storage requirement is higher
</p>
<p>than what is available in the MCU, and a radio for communication of data. Local
</p>
<p>algorithm for capturing and processing the data is programmed into the MCU.
</p>
<p>Although transceiver and/or receiver circuits in the radio module are generally
</p>
<p>accepted to be the most power-hungry of all blocks, the rest of the system com-
</p>
<p>ponents, software and hardware power management features, algorithms and pro-
</p>
<p>tocols may potentially have far greater cumulative impact on the average power
</p>
<p>dissipation and energy consumption of the node.
</p>
<p>Table 3.1 illustrates the power dissipation values for fundamental components
</p>
<p>and modes of the two sensor node architectures captured by a case study in 2002.
</p>
<p>Although the technology scaling in integrated circuit industry results in significant
</p>
<p>(potentially up to 2&ndash;3 orders of magnitude) reduction today in all of the provided
</p>
<p>power figures, the table is indicative of the relative spread of power consumption
</p>
<p>across modes of operation, and across different architectures. For calculation of
</p>
<p>accurate energy consumption, it is necessary to characterize the portion of the total
</p>
<p>operation time that is statistically spent in each valid sensor node power state i.e.
</p>
<p>percent residence per power state. Then the average power per sensor node can be
</p>
<p>computed for battery life estimation through weighted summation of all power
</p>
<p>levels. A comprehensive model was recently developed [10] for accurately
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.4 System architecture of a typical wireless sensor node [9]
</p>
<p>68 A. Muhtaroğlu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>predicting the power consumption of wireless sensor nodes across a variety of
</p>
<p>usage scenarios. It can be inferred from the table that, the variation with various
</p>
<p>power modes aside, transmitter and receiver (radio) circuits in sensor nodes con-
</p>
<p>sume a significant portion of the total power budget. Low-power radios typically
</p>
<p>have a minimum power consumption of around 50 &micro;W, for example, in order to
</p>
<p>provide sufficient sensitivity in body sensor networks [11]. In a recently reported
</p>
<p>bladder-pressure monitoring application [12], the concern was battery life, since the
</p>
<p>recharge frequency was not high. A custom application specific integrated circuit
</p>
<p>(ASIC) implant in this application achieved around 33 &micro;W average power when
</p>
<p>enhanced with a special power control unit (PCU). When the unit was excluded, the
</p>
<p>average power exceeded 1 mW.
</p>
<p>3.1.4 The Case for &ldquo;Batteryless&rdquo;
</p>
<p>A viable energy source continues to be a challenge in wireless sensors that make up
</p>
<p>the IoT infrastructure. Although batteries have traditionally been used to power

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>small microelectronic systems, much of recent research is focused on eliminating
</p>
<p>them from future sensor networks. Historically three parallel motivations have
</p>
<p>driven this thrust:
</p>
<p>i. Green Computing: Information and communication technologies (ICT) gen-
</p>
<p>erate 2% of worldwide CO2 emissions, which roughly corresponds to a quarter
</p>
<p>of the emissions generated by cars [13]. With the unprecedented growth
</p>
<p>forecasted in ICT, as outlined in Sect. 3.1.2, this trend brings on significant
</p>
<p>concerns about the contribution of computing to global warming. There have
</p>
<p>been many emerging initiatives on energy efficiency around the globe, such as
</p>
<p>the Energystar [14], which is clearly a significant component in green com-
</p>
<p>puting approach. The other important component is achieving a sustainable
</p>
<p>life-cycle cost in microelectronics. An undisputed problem in this regard has
</p>
<p>been the disposal of batteries or disposal of microelectronic components that
</p>
<p>contain batteries.
</p>
<p>ii. Avoiding Invasive and Bulky: Implantable sensors are of high interest in
</p>
<p>biomedical field for monitoring various body functions, such as blood pressure
</p>
<p>[15], electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and elec-
</p>
<p>tromyogram (EMG) [16]. However, their utility reduces significantly if they
</p>
<p>become invasive to the part of the body they are integrated in, or even cause
</p>
<p>additional patient anxiety due to bulkiness. Significant portion of the volume
</p>
<p>and intrusiveness of non-batteryless body sensor networks can be traced to
</p>
<p>on-board batteries.
</p>
<p>iii. Cost Reduction: Due to the cost and inconvenience or in some cases unfea-
</p>
<p>sibility of regular refurbishing of batteries, the operational expenses of the
</p>
<p>WSNs increase significantly. In many embedded applications, it may even be
</p>
<p>cheaper to install a new sensor node instead of accessing the old one for
</p>
<p>maintenance and battery replacement.
</p>
<p>3.1.5 Consumption Management and Generation
</p>
<p>Due to the concomitant power resource constraints, as discussed in the previous
</p>
<p>section, management of power and energy at sensor nodes takes high priority. There
</p>
<p>are many energy saving methods to improve the working model or algorithms
</p>
<p>employed by a given sensor at the data manipulation or communication layer in
</p>
<p>order to ensure different components are activated on demand whenever there is a
</p>
<p>significant &ldquo;event&rdquo;. These techniques significantly reduce average power con-
</p>
<p>sumption, and hence the energy. A comprehensive tree of approaches that can be
</p>
<p>applied to the energy conservation problem for a particular system is outlined in
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.5.
</p>
<p>Duty cycling solutions emphasize management of the radio transceiver subsys-
</p>
<p>tem, which traditionally consumes much more energy than the processing sub-
</p>
<p>system. Distributed sleep/wake-up scheduling algorithms are applied to the radio
</p>
<p>70 A. Muhtaroğlu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>circuits in order to turn them on when there is data to send or receive. The
</p>
<p>present-day subsystem components also support multiple power management
</p>
<p>modes, depending on &ldquo;how active&rdquo; they need to be in any given instant. Such
</p>
<p>component power management features will be further discussed later. Excessive
</p>
<p>data sampling unnecessarily keeps both the processor(s) and the transceivers awake
</p>
<p>causing them to burn active power. Thus, data driven techniques shown as one of
</p>
<p>the main branches in Fig. 3.5 target diminution in the amount of sampled or
</p>
<p>transmitted data, while maintaining the minimum required sensing accuracy. When
</p>
<p>the sensor nodes are static, some nodes may be on congested data paths while
</p>
<p>others may hardly receive data &lsquo;hops&rsquo; from the surroundings. Such asymmetry in
</p>
<p>WSN may require location based management schemes. In cases when sensor
</p>
<p>nodes are dynamic, data &lsquo;hops&rsquo; may first detect proximity of the receiving sensors
</p>
<p>to the transmitting sensors in order to optimize power dissipated in transmission.
</p>
<p>Such algorithms are categorized under mobility-based approaches in the figure.
</p>
<p>Details of the individual energy conservation schemes in the tree will not be dis-
</p>
<p>cussed further here, but can be accessed at the original publication [17].
</p>
<p>Various hardware design and fabrication methods are utilized to reduce power
</p>
<p>consumption at component level, which all directly contribute to the power man-
</p>
<p>agement of the sensor node. Different facets of power management in microelec-
</p>
<p>tronic computing systems are presented in Fig. 3.6. The balloon on the lower right
</p>
<p>represents the software design features described in the above paragraphs. As the rest
</p>
<p>of the picture exhaustively presents, the hardware power management design task is
</p>
<p>shared across different expertise areas. Process technology based features combine
</p>
<p>physical enhancements to semiconductors with fabrication methods to reduce static
</p>
<p>power consumption (leakage) per device for a targeted switching performance.
</p>
<p>Circuit designers focus on effective use of transistors in order to simultaneously
</p>
<p>achieve goals related to circuit delay, dynamic and static power dissipation through
</p>
<p>various circuit design techniques. Architects use their knowledge of hardware/
</p>
<p>software interface and how different hardware blocks are expected to &ldquo;behave&rdquo; to
</p>
<p>optimize power at a higher abstraction level. For example, memory blocks can be put
</p>
<p>in low-leakage (e.g. low supply voltage) mode, when not in use. Clocks may be

<p>removed from blocks of processing units (clock gating) to reduce dynamic power
</p>
<p>dissipation, or power may be shut down to inactive blocks selectively to lower total
</p>
<p>power. Dynamic speed/power tradeoffs can be realized in real-time through the
</p>
<p>simultaneous modulation of supply voltage and operating system clock frequency.
</p>
<p>Integration of power electronics, such as DC/DC regulators, into the SOC reduces
</p>
<p>system cost, and allows elimination of losses in large power delivery networks. More
</p>
<p>importantly, processing engines can control supply voltage with better resolution to
</p>
<p>support advanced power management. Temperature, power, motion sensors incor-
</p>
<p>porated into the electronic components or SOCs further provide tools for system
</p>
<p>level power/performance optimizations, while keeping within reliability constraints.
</p>
<p>Energy scavenging (a.k.a. energy harvesting), depicted at the bottom of Fig. 3.6,
</p>
<p>has recently been a fast growing area of research and development to enhance
</p>
<p>system power management characteristics, and address the issues associated with
</p>
<p>batteries covered in Sect. 3.1.4. This trend is encouraged by the ever-diminishing
</p>

<p>sources in the vicinity of the sensor node to generate electrical power. Since such
</p>
<p>resources practically never run out, they are referred to as &ldquo;renewable&rdquo;. Although
</p>
<p>traditional renewable energy sources such as sunlight and wind can and should be
</p>
<p>utilized in a variety of IoT contexts when applicable, they are often non-existent in
</p>
<p>the environment of the embedded sensors. When they do get utilized, the associated
</p>
<p>transducers need to be miniaturized to satisfy the requirements of the micro-scale IT
</p>
<p>nodes. Therefore, there are multiple system design challenges involved. Examples
</p>
<p>from appealing solutions will be discussed in the next section in the context of
</p>
<p>applications.
</p>
<p>3.2 Systems and Applications
</p>
<p>3.2.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>System design issues associated with incorporating and utilizing available energy
</p>
<p>sources around intelligent embedded systems are reviewed in this section.
</p>
<p>Particularly micro-scale (solar) photovoltaic, piezoelectric, vibration based elec-
</p>
<p>tromagnetic, thermoelectric and ambient radio-frequency (RF) wave energy will
</p>
<p>receive focus. The final section of the chapter highlights examples from emerging
</p>
<p>applications to demonstrate successful technology integration, and upcoming
</p>
<p>trends.
</p>
<p>3.2.2 System Design
</p>
<p>The goal of an ideal energy harvester, which is often referred to as a micro-power
</p>
<p>generator, is to replace the battery previously depicted in Fig. 3.4. Availability of
</p>
<p>sufficient energy at the source is an important but an insufficient condition for
</p>
<p>energy harvesting. This is due to the fact that useful power available at the
</p>
<p>micro-scale power generators typically varies between micro-Watts to tens of
</p>
<p>milli-Watts, with voltage output between tens of milli-Volts to hundreds of
</p>
<p>milli-Volts, at most, under realistic scenarios. It may take one or more power
</p>
<p>electronics stages before the power can be safely delivered to the sensor node with
</p>
<p>acceptable voltage and current characteristics.
</p>
<p>Each stage bears losses, and inadvertently reduces overall system efficiency by
</p>
<p>some amount. For example, if the generated voltage from the harvester is in AC
</p>
<p>(alternating-current) form, it requires rectification because typical electronic loads
</p>
<p>consume DC (direct-current) power. If the harvester output impedance or resistance
</p>
<p>characteristic is far from that of an ideal supply or varies significantly with envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental conditions, then impedance matching circuit may be required to extract
</p>
<p>maximum energy. Finally, the voltage needs to be stepped-up to suitable levels for
</p>
<p>3 Micro-scale Energy Harvesting for Batteryless Information Technologies 73</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the load circuits in the target system. Integrated design approaches often combine a
</p>
<p>number of such circuits in one design to simultaneously reduce the cost and size of
</p>
<p>the interface electronics, and improve power conversion efficiency. It is challenging
</p>
<p>to design interface electronics with high efficiency, especially in cost and area
</p>
<p>constrained systems. Therefore, one needs to carefully analyze the target applica-
</p>
<p>tion, and evaluate solution space for energy harvester integration at minimum cost.
</p>
<p>3.2.3 Micro-scale Harvesters
</p>
<p>Micro-scale IT systems vary widely in volume between few cm3 to few tens of cm3,
</p>
<p>which sets the range for acceptable sizes for the energy harvesters. The energy
</p>
<p>sources in the vicinity also alter in magnitude and availability. Depending on use
</p>
<p>environment, some sensor nodes may experience motion and vibration, while others
</p>
<p>may be subject to temperature variations. A number of embedded applications may,
</p>
<p>by design, shield RF radiation, while others may be exposed to strong RF waves.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary to carefully analyze application environment and
</p>
<p>requirements before incorporating the correct energy harvesting mode. Common
</p>
<p>ambient energy sources for embedded sensors are outlined in Table 3.2, along with
</p>
<p>available power density and voltage levels at their output. Pros and cons have also
</p>
<p>been listed.
</p>
<p>3.2.3.1 Photovoltaic (Solar) Energy Harvesting
</p>
<p>In a typical photovoltaic (PV) system shown in Fig. 3.7, MPPT (Maximum Power
</p>
<p>Point Tracking) sub-system matches the input impedance of the power conditioning
</p>
<p>circuitry to the output impedance of the PV source, and the output impedance of the
</p>
<p>power conditioning circuitry to the input impedance of the load. The function of
</p>
<p>maximizing power extraction across varying temperature and irradiance conditions
</p>
<p>is also often incorporated into the MPPT. All of these features bring along the extra
</p>
<p>burden of power consumption, and only make sense when this consumption is
</p>
<p>much lower than the harvested average power. System analysis is performed on
</p>
<p>feasibility of incorporating such circuits, which often results in bare minimum
</p>
<p>power conditioning design in sensor systems without a digital controller.
</p>
<p>One such simplified design based on COTS is presented in [19], with robust
</p>
<p>functionality, bare-bone maximum power point (MPP) support, and up to 10%
</p>
<p>divergence from the truly optimal operating point (PV current and voltage). The
</p>
<p>energy harvesting interface circuit consumes less than 1 mW. Since no MCU or
</p>
<p>DSP (Digital Signal Processor) is utilized for MPP regulation, the system can be
</p>
<p>shut down when unused for energy savings. A small (9 mm2) pilot cell with the
</p>
<p>same characteristics as the main harvester array (112 cm2) is used to track maxi-
</p>
<p>mum power point based on fractional open circuit voltage method as depicted in
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.8. The governing relationship in Eq. 3.1 justifies this simple approach to

<p>3.2.3.2 Thermoelectric (Temperature Difference) Energy Harvesting
</p>
<p>The available voltage level from thermoelectric micro-modules is low, as noted
</p>
<p>previously in Table 3.2. Recent work on integrating TE modules into WSN nodes
</p>
<p>have thus focused on developing efficient voltage step-up circuits. An integrated
</p>
<p>interface circuit in 0.35 &micro;m CMOS technology reported by [20] boosts 35 mV
</p>
<p>input voltage from a TE module up to regulated 1.8 V output to drive a sensor
</p>
<p>node. A motion activated switch is used to mechanically assist the starting of power
</p>
<p>generation, as depicted in Fig. 3.9. This approach avoids batteries for start-up. The
</p>
<p>interface achieves 58% efficiency using external inductors for the buck converter
</p>
<p>and start-up. The existing large inductors (not shown in the figure) cannot be
</p>
<p>integrated on-chip in this design, adding incrementally to the system cost (and size).
</p>
<p>The printed circuit board (PCB) for the thermal harvesting system only occupies
</p>
<p>7.5 cm2.
</p>
<p>A 130 nm CMOS ultra-low power batteryless energy harvesting body sensor
</p>
<p>node (BSN) system-on-chip (SoC) was presented in [16], which acquires, pro-
</p>
<p>cesses, and transmits electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), and
</p>
<p>electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Dynamic power management concepts, low
</p>
<p>voltage and subthreshold circuit techniques for low power design are applied to
</p>
<p>constrain average power dissipation to 19 &micro;W, which is supplied by thermoelectric
</p>
<p>module and/or RF harvester. It operates at a minimum thermoelectric supply
</p>
<p>voltage of 30 mV. The design, depicted at high level in Fig. 3.10, is a first of its
</p>
<p>kind in multiple aspects, but certainly in the small power dissipation achieved for
</p>
<p>the number of features it supports. A 4 � 4 cm2 COTS thermoelectric generator
(TEG) module successfully delivers the required sensor node power at room tem-
</p>
<p>perature when attached to the back of the neck or chest of a human being. First, the
</p>
<p>boost converter and voltage regulator together step up harvested TEG input up to a
</p>
<p>regulated 1.35 V using an off-chip capacitor and an inductor for efficient

<p>conversion. The regulator in addition provides five regulated voltage supplies and a
</p>
<p>bandgap reference to the rest of the chip. Monitored signal is processed through an
</p>
<p>analog front-end (AFE) with programmable gain and sampling range, and con-
</p>
<p>verted to digital domain using the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) block.
</p>
<p>Signals as low as a few &micro;Vs are amplified with less than 4 &micro;W power consumption
</p>
<p>per analog channel. The digital processing system that follows is implemented
</p>
<p>using subthreshold circuit design techniques, and incorporates power and clock
</p>
<p>gating as well as dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) for optimization of power dissi-
</p>
<p>pation. Internal voltage regulation control circuit requires 600 mV to start up,
</p>
<p>which is not available from the TEG. Wireless RF power is therefore used for
</p>
<p>kick-starting. A short RF burst of &minus;10 dBm completes a one-time precharge of
</p>
<p>VBOOST node within few seconds after TEG output settles through a six-stage
</p>
<p>charge pump circuit. The system is able to communicate data wirelessly in
</p>
<p>433 MHz ISM band with low (280 &micro;W) instantaneous (burst) power consumption.
</p>
<p>3.2.3.3 Piezoelectric (Vibration) Energy Harvesting
</p>
<p>Piezoelectric (PZT) harvesters have high output impedance, and need an impedance
</p>
<p>matching interface in order to supply maximum power. Recent improvements to
</p>
<p>conventional full-bridge rectifier and voltage doubler interface circuits have
</p>
<p>increased the piezoelectric harvester efficiency to above 85% [21]. This is achieved
</p>
<p>through a number of circuit enhancements for efficiency. External inductor arbiter
</p>
<p>component (with value in tens of &micro;Hs), shown in Fig. 3.11, cannot be integrated
</p>
<p>on-chip in the design. On the other hand special features, such as analog multi-
</p>
<p>plexers, are embodied to enable various power converters to share the same
</p>
<p>inductor for cost reduction.
</p>
<p>A different approach for power conversion, named synchronous electric charge
</p>
<p>extraction (SECE) is currently researched by several groups. The Multi-shot SECE
</p>
<p>system (MS-SECE), depicted in Fig. 3.12 [22], can self-start and handle a wide
</p>
<p>range of piezoelectric power and voltage levels with the help of small off-chip
</p>
<p>components. It only consumes 1 &micro;W at 5 Hz vibration frequency, and is suitable
</p>
<p>for low frequency motion available in daily human activity. The efficiency is

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>reported at 61% using a 125 mm3 coupled-inductor. Storage capacitors Casic and
</p>
<p>Cwsn in Fig. 3.12 are dedicated to the power supplies of the MS-SECE integrated
</p>
<p>circuit (IC) component and WSN device respectively. There is an &ldquo;optimized path&rdquo;
</p>
<p>controlled through the KP and KS switch transistors to implement the SECE tech-
</p>
<p>nique. The PZT harvester is optimally discharged through the flyback circuit to
</p>
<p>Cwsn. The SECE technique is based on storing charge to the primary inductor (Lp)
</p>
<p>when PZT harvester voltage reaches maximum value, and then transferring charge
</p>
<p>to secondary inductor (Ls) after a predetermined period by closing KS and opening
</p>
<p>KP. The further optimized MS-SECE technique transfers the energy from the
</p>
<p>harvester in N successive transfers instead of a single transfer (hence the name
</p>
<p>&ldquo;multi-shot&rdquo;). As the maximum value of the voltage vp is detected, multi-shot

<p>generator and ring-oscillator turn on to precisely control KP and KS for charge
</p>
<p>transfer. When VDDwsn reaches a predetermined threshold, Pgood_wsn signal trig-
</p>
<p>gers WSN block to perform a measurement or a RF transmission. The
</p>
<p>&ldquo;non-optimized path&rdquo;, which is used to charge Casic directly from the PZT har-
</p>
<p>vester, is activated during the cold-start, and periodically when Casic voltage drops
</p>
<p>below a minimum. FSM_slow block utilizes the Pgood_asic signal from the
</p>
<p>Pgood-ASIC block and clock from the relaxation-oscillator to manage transition
</p>
<p>between optimized and non-optimized paths.
</p>
<p>An application oriented study [23] on potential of typing as energy source
</p>
<p>couples electromagnetic and piezoelectric energy harvesting from the computer
</p>
<p>keyboard strikes. A prototype demonstrates that 40.8 &micro;W can be harvested from a
</p>
<p>single key using a micro-machined piezoelectric component, and 1.15 &micro;W from an
</p>
<p>electromagnetic component. Another similar application oriented study [24] focuses
</p>
<p>on the potential to power a body sensor node (BSN) through piezoelectric and
</p>
<p>thermoelectric harvesters. Real time experiments on human body demonstrate
</p>
<p>generation of up to 20 &micro;W at room temperature in a 9 cm2 area of thermoelectric
</p>
<p>generator. In addition, a 0.5 cm3 piezoelectric harvester used in this work generates
</p>
<p>3.7 &micro;W while running at 7 miles/h.
</p>
<p>3.2.3.4 Electromagnetic (Vibration) Energy Harvesting
</p>
<p>Another practical kinetic energy harvesting type relates to the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>principle of Faraday&rsquo;s Law. A magnet is typically actuated with low frequency
</p>
<p>environmental motion within a coil to generate current. Since the coil has low
</p>
<p>output impedance, power extraction does not typically require the type of complex
</p>
<p>interfaces described in the previous section.
</p>
<p>A novel batteryless interface was presented in a recent study [25] to be utilized
</p>
<p>in a system with low voltage electromagnetic harvesters to supply WSN nodes. The
</p>
<p>system, shown in Fig. 3.13, has an in-house 2 cm � 3.5 cm cylindrical harvester
that feeds a novel rectification circuit with a passive (less efficient) first stage that
</p>
<p>powers an active AC-DC doubler with high efficiency. The first stage AC-DC
</p>
<p>converter consists of diode-connected MOSFET transistors, and doubles the input
</p>
<p>peak voltage.
</p>
<p>The active doubler gets powered by the passive circuit to deliver DC voltage to
</p>
<p>the final stage with high efficiency. The final stage consists of an integrated step-up
</p>
<p>converter built using a charge-pump. The minimum AC input peak voltage that can
</p>
<p>be rectified by the system is 125 mV. The output voltage range is 1&ndash;2.48 V. The
</p>
<p>compact and low cost solution is suitable for a number of low frequency applica-
</p>
<p>tions. The combined rectifier stage can deliver 25 &micro;W and 0.61 V with 67% effi-
</p>
<p>ciency, while the second stage can deliver higher voltages and few &micro;Ws with 13%
</p>
<p>efficiency. Charge-pumps in general are commonly used for fully integrated voltage
</p>
<p>step-up, but are low in efficiency as demonstrated in this work.

<p>3.2.3.5 Ambient RF Harvesting

<p>Wireless digital television signals are constantly broadcasted over the air in many
</p>
<p>geographies. A wireless energy harvesting prototype, named E-WEHP [26],
</p>
<p>demonstrated harvesting of sufficient power from a TV broadcast source that is

<p>3.3 Conclusion
</p>
<p>Managing power consumption through traditional and new technologies enables
</p>
<p>smaller batteries and more compact microelectronic systems. In parallel, energy
</p>
<p>harvesting continues to be a pivotal research and development area in efforts to
</p>
<p>achieve batteryless operation in increased number of platforms. Micro-scale energy
</p>
<p>harvesting will enable many more aspects of intelligent living and working spaces.
</p>
<p>The reasons for the current trends have been presented in Sect. 3.1, and few selected
</p>
<p>examples have been provided in Sect. 3.2 from recent literature to demonstrate the
</p>
<p>state of the art. The upcoming developments are projected in the next paragraphs to
</p>
<p>conclude the chapter.

<p>3.3.1 Upcoming Trends
</p>
<p>A number of critical issues around sensor platforms with energy harvesting will
</p>
<p>continue to receive attention from researchers in order to enable new batteryless
</p>
<p>applications. These areas are outlined below in no particular order.
</p>
<p>i. Hybrid mode harvesting: Wireless sensor nodes need to support multiple
</p>
<p>harvesting modes at the same time in a hybrid configuration as depicted in
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.15 in order to extend on-board features and communication range.
</p>
<p>Examples of these have recently been noted, combining thermoelectric and
</p>
<p>RF, thermoelectric and piezoelectric, piezoelectric and RF harvesting.
</p>
<p>However, seamless implementation of a single power supply with multiple
</p>
<p>sources requires further study.
</p>
<p>ii. True self-starting operation: Efforts will continue to provide self-starting
</p>
<p>operation in all systems without batteries. Many of the more efficient systems
</p>
<p>today take advantage of small batteries, or depend on a kick-starting RF signal
</p>
<p>or motion to self-start. The system goal is to start on detection of any type and
</p>
<p>amount of energy in the surroundings without requiring any special
</p>
<p>arrangement.
</p>
<p>iii. Integration and Efficiency: SoC integration will strive to pull in harvesters,
</p>
<p>interface circuits, and sensors into the same package, and eventually into the
</p>
<p>same semiconductor component. Elimination of all off-chip discrete compo-
</p>
<p>nents (capacitors, inductors) will receive focus. Research on integrated CMOS
</p>

</p>
<p>3 Micro-scale Energy Harvesting for Batteryless Information Technologies 83</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>compatible interface circuits will hence maximize power conversion efficiency
</p>
<p>without the use of discrete components. This is required not only for minia-
</p>
<p>turization of sensor nodes, but also for reduction of cost to levels that will
</p>
<p>enable massive use of sensors in disposable or semi-disposable applications.
</p>
<p>iv. Improved materials: Material improvements will deliver transducers with
</p>
<p>higher intrinsic efficiency. This includes efficiency improvements in solar
</p>
<p>cells, thermoelectric modules, piezoelectric cantilevers, magnetic components,
</p>
<p>and RF antennas. Storage capacitors and super-capacitors with lower leakage
</p>
<p>will also be of major interest to reduce losses. New harvesters and harvesting
</p>
<p>modes will be researched in order to extend the harnessed frequency band for
</p>
<p>solar irradiation, vibrations, and RF waves without increasing the system size
</p>
<p>and cost.

<p>Abstract In the first part of the research, we present the design of a vibration-based
</p>
<p>energy harvesting system. Robotic flexible arm having variable cross-section is
</p>
<p>investigated to overcome serious problems, e.g. insufficient bandwidth and model
</p>
<p>inaccuracies. Most of the energy harvesting systems are linear with unimodal
</p>
<p>characteristics. On the other hand, real vibrations can be modeled as random,
</p>
<p>multi-modal and time varying systems. Hence, unimodal linear systems can give
</p>
<p>highly unsatisfactory results under certain circumstances. However, non-linear
</p>
<p>systems can have multi-modal character with increased performance in real and
</p>
<p>practical situations. In this work, tapered links are preferred with nonlinear coupling
</p>
<p>setup to provide sufficient bandwidth and output power requirements for modern
</p>
<p>applications. Thus, the proposed scheme has been proven by simulated and
</p>
<p>experimental results successfully. In the second part of the research, we present
</p>
<p>design and experimental results of an electromagnetic harvester, energy source of
</p>
<p>which is single-phase household AC power with a nominal voltage of 220 V and a
</p>
<p>frequency of 50 Hz. In this case, energy harvesting is based on the induced elec-
</p>
<p>tromotive force (EMF) as a result of the periodic variations of the magnetic field
</p>
<p>around the AC power cord. In this part, we also discuss basic principles of a
</p>
<p>wireless sensor network design powered by electromagnetically harvested energy
</p>
<p>obtained from household alternating current.

<p>4.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Portable devices cannot be maintained steadily by limited power sources, e.g.
</p>
<p>batteries. This idea improved and motivated the research in energy harvesting area.
</p>
<p>Harvesting by vibrating resources, e.g. trains, buildings, bridges, cars, aircraft,
</p>
<p>machinery, is well-studied. One of the harvesting methods is based on piezoelectric
</p>
<p>materials that can transform electrical energy into mechanical strain or force and
</p>
<p>vice versa [1&ndash;4]. Recently, remote sensors/actuators are usually hard to reach as
</p>
<p>they are hidden in inaccessible locations such as bridges, civil buildings, even
</p>
<p>human body. Thus, energy harvesting is the only way to keep them alive [5&ndash;7].
</p>
<p>88 M. Doğan et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As the first case study, e.g. [8], we consider a vibration-based harvesting system
</p>
<p>including beams with piezoelectric layers and proof mass. Most of the energy
</p>
<p>harvesting systems are linear with unimodal characteristics. On the other hand, real
</p>
<p>vibrations can be modeled as random, multi-modal and time varying systems.
</p>
<p>Hence, unimodal linear systems can give highly unsatisfactory results under certain
</p>
<p>circumstances. However, non-linear systems can have multi-modal character with
</p>
<p>increased performance in real and practical situations. In this work, tapered links are
</p>
<p>preferred with nonlinear coupling setup to provide sufficiently bandwidth and
</p>
<p>output power requirements for modern applications. Thus, the proposed scheme has
</p>
<p>been proven by simulated and experimental results successfully.
</p>
<p>The flexible beams with piezoelectric layers can capture the environmental
</p>
<p>vibrations. The partial differential equations (PDE) are used to model such a
</p>
<p>challenging system due to nonlinear coupling for producing accurate and consistent
</p>
<p>results, compare with finite-dimensional models, e.g. ordinary differential equations
</p>
<p>(ODE) or finite element method (FEM), approaches, refer to [9, 10]. Thus, we will
</p>
<p>use the infinite-dimensional model in [9] for the energy harvesting system.
</p>
<p>Optimal geometry of flexible links can be investigated to improve some features,
</p>
<p>e.g. low mass, low moments of inertia and high natural frequencies, e.g. see [11].
</p>
<p>Besides, large bandwidth is required for fast and stable motion, can be achieved
</p>
<p>with high fundamental frequency, e.g. refer to [12]. Therefore, non-uniform
</p>
<p>cross-section is implemented for the links in this research.
</p>
<p>The tapered beam structure and inherent non-linearity of the flexible arm model
</p>
<p>are indispensable to improve the bandwidth and output power. Thus, different from
</p>
<p>the literature, e.g. cantilever beams with permanent magnets, see [13&ndash;18], we do not
</p>
<p>use magnets, multiple beam-mass systems and lumped parameter models to
</p>
<p>increase the bandwidth and/or to introduce the non-linearity. One of main contri-
</p>
<p>butions is that the proposed structure is simple enough to catch multi-modality and
</p>
<p>nonlinearity.
</p>
<p>As the second case study, we will deal with an energy harvesting case for
</p>
<p>wireless network sensors. Wireless sensor nodes typically have power requirements
</p>
<p>as low as microwatts, and as the batteries suitable for wireless sensor have limited
</p>
<p>lifetimes of the order of a few years, powering such systems by energy scavenging
</p>
<p>is an interesting and practical alternative since sensor nodes will no longer require
</p>
<p>the occasional battery replacement [19].
</p>
<p>We consider a household power consumption detector for real time monitoring.
</p>
<p>Real time power consumption monitoring helps customers be more informed about
</p>
<p>their energy consumption and have greater control of their monthly costs. Our
</p>
<p>detector is based on a sensor with a current sense transformer which is powered by
</p>
<p>electromagnetically harvested energy originated from the AC source and is capable
</p>
<p>of wireless communication [20]. The detector transmits its readings wirelessly to a
</p>
<p>computer or a mobile terminal.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.2 Vibration-Based Energy Scavenger
</p>
<p>The power spectrum of the proposed system is significantly improved by
</p>
<p>non-uniform geometry of the links, especially for low frequency band that covers
</p>
<p>the most of practical ambient vibrations. The flexible robot arm configuration and
</p>
<p>equations of motion for the system are obtained with the extended Hamilton&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>principle, see extensive work in [8, 9].
</p>
<p>4.2.1 Energy Harvester Design
</p>
<p>Usual vibration sources have random, multi-modal and time varying characteristics.
</p>
<p>Hence, unimodal linear systems could be rather inefficient compared to non-linear
</p>
<p>systems that are capable of responding over a broad frequency range, thus per-
</p>
<p>forming better in realistic vibration spectrum.
</p>
<p>The proposed novel energy harvesting system with tapered geometry of the
</p>
<p>flexible arm, covered with thin piezoelectric materials. The analytic model which is
</p>
<p>developed in [8, 9], are modified with damping terms and external excitation. Two
</p>
<p>kinds of damping mechanisms are added to the model in [9]: viscous damping and
</p>
<p>Kelvin&ndash;Voigt (or strain-rate) damping. This will be helpful for modelling due to its
</p>
<p>extreme sensitivity to mechanical damping for the power output under resonance
</p>
<p>excitation. Therefore designing the energy harvester beam to have less damping can
</p>
<p>be more important than choosing the right piezoelectric material [21]. Modified
</p>
<p>equations (PDE) of motion that includes damping terms are given in [8]. The
</p>
<p>vibration modes will be distributed over rich spectrum content due to non-linear
</p>
<p>coupling as rigorously proven in [8]. On the other hand, tapered beam geometry
</p>
<p>provides uniform strain field, e.g., trapezoidal geometry can supply efficiently more
</p>
<p>than twice the energy per unit volume than the rectangular one [22]. Besides,
</p>
<p>increasing the slope of tapering improves bandwidth [23, 24]. The proposed energy
</p>
<p>harvesting system can be easily implemented due to its simple geometry and
</p>
<p>structure.
</p>
<p>4.2.2 Simulation Results
</p>
<p>The proposed harvesting system is simulated using a MATLAB code. The PDEs
</p>
<p>are discretized in both spatial and time domains using finite difference method. In
</p>
<p>order to avoid complexity of the fourth-order derivative approximation, the
</p>
<p>second-order derivative approximation has been managed by using intermediate
</p>
<p>states that corresponds to physical variables such as deflections, velocity and
</p>
<p>bending moments, e.g. refer to [25]. The same method was also applied success-
</p>
<p>fully and proven in [26]. The model parameters for the system, partially given in

<p>peak near &plusmn;2 is applied as external base excitation [8].
</p>
<p>The simulations are summarized in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2. The tapered beam structure
</p>
<p>and inherent non-linearity of the flexible arm model are indispensable to improve
</p>
<p>the bandwidth and output power. Increasing the slope of the beam result in robust
</p>
<p>vibrations with increased amplitudes, see Fig. 4.2.

<p>Although, any kind of nonuniform cross-section can be implemented; in this

<p>4.3 Wireless Sensor Network Powered
</p>
<p>by Electromagnetically Harvested Energy
</p>
<p>In this section, we present design and the experimental results of an electromagnetic
</p>
<p>energy harvester. The source of harvested energy is single-phase household AC
</p>
<p>power with a nominal voltage of 220 V and a frequency of 50 Hz. We also discuss
</p>
<p>the use of harvested energy to power a wireless sensor network.
</p>
<p>4.3.1 Energy Harvester Design
</p>
<p>Energy harvesting is based on the induced electromotive force (EMF) due to change
</p>
<p>in the magnetic flux as a result of the periodic variations of the magnetic field
</p>
<p>around the AC power cord. Using Faraday&rsquo;s Law of Induction, it is seen that
</p>
<p>amplitude of induced EMF is proportional to four quantities: Frequency of the
</p>
<p>alternating current (AC), amplitude of the alternating current, number of turns of the
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.11 Frequency
</p>
<p>response of the two links
</p>
<p>without tip mass with an
</p>
<p>estimated dominant frequency

<p>of183 Hz

<p>coil and the area enclosed by the coil. We are interested in harvesting power from a
</p>
<p>sub-kHz frequency and our typical current amplitude are at most of the order of a
</p>
<p>few 10 Amperes. Moreover, we have to restrict the area enclosed by the coil due to
</p>
<p>two reasons: Firstly, both magnetic field strength falls dramatically around a wire
</p>
<p>with distance. It typically changes with 1/r for very long straight wires, but in real
</p>
<p>life problems where the length of the straight part of the wire is of the order the
</p>
<p>geometric dimensions of the coil this decrease might be more substantial. Secondly,
</p>
<p>we seek for a harvesting solution that is as compact as possible. Thus, we try to
</p>
<p>increase the number of turns of the coil as much as possible without significantly
</p>
<p>extending the size of the coil. We also choose the type of the wire to ensure that it is
</p>
<p>not too thin to limit the total resistance and it is not too thick to limit the overall size
</p>
<p>of the coin.
</p>
<p>Properties of the coil used as the energy harvester are listed in Table 4.2.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.13 shows geometry of the coil.
</p>
<p>To harvest energy from the AC wire, we work on three different experimental
</p>
<p>setups. For the first and second setups (see top left and top right panels of
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.14), we separated the phase wire from the neutral wire so that they are more
</p>
<p>than 30 cm away. Then, as for the first setup, we place the phase wire close to the
</p>
<p>coil to enhance the magnetic flux and thus the amplitude of induced EMF. Similarly
</p>
<p>to test the amount of decrease in the harvested energy with increasing distance from
</p>
<p>the phase wire, we increase the distance between the phase wire and the coil.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, to increase the magnetic flux even further, we place both phase and neutral
</p>
<p>wires in the opposite edges of the coil (see bottom panel of Fig. 4.14). For all of
</p>
<p>these setups, the wire (or wires) are carefully held on the same plane with the area
</p>
<p>enclosing the coil.

</p>
<p>cord is connected to a 1000 W heater or a 2000 W heater. We measure current as a

<p>4.3.3 Design of a Wireless Sensor Network Powered

<p>by Electromagnetically Harvested Energy Obtained
</p>
<p>from Household Alternating Current
</p>
<p>Energy harvesting from household alternating current requires more diligent designs
</p>
<p>compared to energy harvesting from an RF field due to the fact that frequencies
</p>
<p>involved are orders of smaller compared to RF frequencies, see e.g. [27&ndash;29]. As seen
</p>
<p>from Figs. 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, 4.19, 4.20, 4.21, 4.22, 4.23, 4.24, 4.25, 4.26 and 4.27,
</p>
<p>harvested energy input from an AC power cord can be obtained very efficiently using
</p>
<p>a harvester design presented as the third experimental setup as shown in bottom
</p>
<p>panel of Fig. 4.14. For such a design, harvested powers can reach up to a few Watts
</p>
<p>for loads up to 1 kX in case of household currents of �5&ndash;10 A.

</p>
<p>4.4 Conclusion
</p>
<p>In this chapter, firstly we investigated the design of energy harvester by a flexible
</p>
<p>arm with non-uniform cross-section. It is proven by the simulation results that the
</p>
<p>new design method can provide efficient energy harvesting without complex
</p>
<p>structures, e.g. magnets and separated links. Coupled non-linear systems can have
</p>
<p>multi-modal character with increased performance in real and practical situations.
</p>
<p>The shape of the power spectrum is retained effectively even with some geometry
</p>
<p>and mass changes. This proves the robustness of the proposed scheme.
</p>
<p>The tapered beam structure and inherent non-linearity of the flexible robot arm
</p>
<p>are indispensable to improve the frequency response and maximum output power.
</p>
<p>Thus, different from the literature, e.g. cantilever beams with permanent magnets,
</p>
<p>we do not use magnets, multiple beam-mass systems and lumped parameter models
</p>
<p>to increase the bandwidth and/or to introduce the non-linearity. One of main con-
</p>
<p>tributions is that the proposed structure is simple enough to catch multi-modality
</p>
<p>and nonlinearity.
</p>
<p>In this work, variable cross-section links are preferred with rigorous nonlinear
</p>
<p>coupling setup to provide sufficiently bandwidth and output power requirements for
</p>
<p>modern applications. Thus, the proposed scheme has been proven by simulated and
</p>
<p>experimental results successfully.
</p>
<p>Secondly, we design and realize an efficient energy harvester which makes use
</p>
<p>of both phase and neutral wires of a household alternating current. Having

<p>Nonlinear Problems in Piezoelectric

<p>Harvesters Under Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>Erol Kurt and Yunus Uzun
</p>
<p>Abstract This chapter focuses on the nonlinear problems in the piezoelectric har-
vester systems under the magnetic field. In this manner, the chapter initially men-
tions an introductory section on the studies of piezoelectric harvester dynamics.
After the introductory section, the basic properties of the piezoelectric systems and
their energy harvester applications will be presented. Since the harvesters have a
complicated structure under the magnetic field, the electromagnetic design, mod-
eling and algebraic studies of a novel harvester study will be pointed out. After the
presentation of a theoretical outline on the harvester systems, the experimental
setups will be explained in detail. Thus, a complete picture of the problem will be
produced in order to sustain a comparable study on the theory and experiment. The
main dynamic quantities such as displacement and velocity of the vibrating piezo-
electric layer as function of the system parameters will be explored. According to
results, the effect of periodic magnetic flux can give varieties of responses from
regular dynamics to chaotic one. Phase space constructions, Poincare sections and
FFTs are evaluated depending on the parameter sets including the excitation fre-
quency f, amplitude Uc of electromagnet and the distance d. It is proven that the
periodic magnetic flux can exert high frequency velocity fluctuations nearby the
minimal and maximal values of the velocity, whereas the situation differs for
the position. Therefore it will be pointed out that the magnetic field mostly governs
the velocity by yielding complicated vibrations. According to the detailed analyses,
the FFTs prove the high frequency responses in addition to the main frequency.
When f differs from the natural frequency of the system f0, the responses become
chaotic. It is proven that lower and higher frequency fluctuations in displacement and
velocity, which are different from f0 decrease the electrical power harvested by the

<p>piezoelectric pendulum. Indeed, it is remarkable to get a relation between the rms
values of displacement/velocity and the harvested power according to the mea-
surements. Thus this relation can be used to estimate the power output in harvester
systems. The piezoelectric harvester generates much energy when f is closed to f0
and the distance to the magnetic device should be closer in order to decrease the
nonlinearities in displacement and velocity. The pendulum-like harvesters as the
most preferable ones can be applied to many devices or units as a power source. The
maximal power for these magnetically-excited structures can be estimated by the
system parameters. At the end of the chapter, the recent techniques of maximal
power point tracking (MPPT) and proposed controller units are explained for the
piezoelectric harvester systems in order to optimize the harvested power.

<p>5.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In parallel with the improvements on the fields of smart material and energy
material technologies, there exists a growing interest on the harvester systems,
world-widely [1&ndash;3]. The energy harvesting studies mainly focus on three types of
harvester systems: Piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and electrostatic [4&ndash;7]. Although
the piezoelectric materials have a complicated material production procedure
(which makes the piezo-structures much expensive than the others in any induction
system), higher energy densities from the piezo-systems can be available [8&ndash;10].
Table 5.1 gives brief information on the energy densities of three harvesting types.
</p>
<p>Piezoelectric systems are more convenient than electromagnetic ones for MEMS
applications, because of the problems in magnets miniaturization with current
state-of-the-art microfabrication processes [12]. Piezoelectric materials can

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>efficiently convert vibrations to electrical energy with relatively high output voltage
but without any other voltage source [5]. In addition to above-mentioned superi-
orities of piezoelectrics, the advances in solid material behavior shed a light to
combine the dynamical aspects of solids and the piezoelectric features in order to
explain the energy harvesting mechanism behind the solid/piezo structures. At this
point, there is very thin separation between a piezoelectric dynamical system and a
piezoelectric harvester system: Mainly if a piezoelectric system can harvest energy
from any ambient effect such as wind, human movement, seismic forces, water
flow, and traffic, etc. [13&ndash;16], it is classified as a piezoelectric harvester, otherwise
any other systems related to the piezo-structures can be acceptable as piezoelectric
dynamic system. From this point, any piezoelectric harvester system is also a
piezoelectric dynamic system, thereby the dynamical tools to explain the physics
and engineering of energy production and fluctuation phenomena can be used to
determine the amplitude/power or velocity/power relations [17, 18].
</p>
<p>According to the dynamics of a fluctuating beam, there exists a wide literature,
which has been mostly studied by physicists and mechanical engineers [19&ndash;21].
According to their approach, a spring-mass model can be used to understand the
dynamics of a fluctuating beam under an external stress and damping effect.
Equivalently, a basic pendulum model has also been used to identify the dynamical
features of the fluctuating beam in some other researches [22&ndash;24]. According to
these two models, the basic harmonic motion is described by the restoring force of
spring or gravitation.
</p>
<p>The piezoelectric beams have certain force-voltage relation. Indeed, when the
beam is buckled by an external stress (i.e. mechanical, magnetic, electrical, mag-
netic, etc.), the beam terminals induce a voltage. Note that if the buckled beam then
becomes static in any position, it does not induce any potential difference since there
is no certain electrical dipole moment inside the crystal structure of piezo-material.
Note also that the polarization direction also plays an important role to have an
efficient voltage production. Strictly speaking the force should be in the polarization
direction of the electrical dipoles. In the case of magnetic stress, the magnetic flux
should be oriented in such a way that the permanent magnet(s) should buckle the
piezoelectric beam in the polarization direction. Therefore the poles of the magnet(s)
and the external magnetic flux direction should be well-simulated [25].
</p>
<p>In the following section, initially some basic information on the electromagnetic
design, modeling and simulation will be given. Next section will handle the
experimental techniques on the piezoelectric systems. Section 5.4 explains the
methods of nonlinear analyses, which are used in the fluctuation studies of

<p>piezoelectric systems. Section 5.5 introduces some piezoelectric systems and
explains their nonlinear analyzes. While the nonlinear analyzes are discussed in the
next section, Sect. 5.7 explains the dependence of dynamics and power to the
system parameters. Section 5.8 presents MPPT techniques for piezoelectric har-
vester systems. Finally the conclusions give the main results of the chapter and
some clues on the future perspectives.
</p>
<p>5.2 Electromagnetic Design, Modeling and Simulation
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic (EM) design is very important for a piezoelectric system in
order to estimate the experimental results and the optimization of the system. If the
EM design is made in a proper way, it helps to decrease the time consumption in the
construction of the setup and the experimental researches. According to the liter-
ature there exists some tools to make electromagnetic design and simulation.
However, all of them use the finite element method (FEM) because of its reliability
and solution speed. Before starting any solution, the geometry and material
assignment should be made correctly. Since the magnetic force depends on the
distance between the magnetic sources and ferromagnetic bodies strictly, especially
the magnetic bodies in the model should be positioned in the correct position in
order to estimate the correct magnetic force fm. In Fig. 5.1, a representative mesh
structure is shown. Note that the number of mesh elements can be useful for the
FEM simulation. Extremely large elements yield to long runs of computer and the
results cannot be obtained in the proper time duration, whereas an optimized
number of elements yield to both correct and faster solution.
</p>
<p>In order to determine the number of mesh elements, one can assign different
numbers to FEM programme and look for the simulation results. If there is a valley
in the graph of a quantity (i.e. magnetic flux U, magnetic flux density B, field
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.1 A representative mesh structure
</p>
<p>110 E. Kurt and Y. Uzun</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>strength H, etc.) as function of number of mesh, then the left edge of this valley can
be used for a proper mesh number [26].
</p>
<p>The modeling of piezoelectric systems can be made as function of time by using
Runge-Kutta time integration technique. It is a proper technique, since the fourth
order term addiction gives good sensitivity for the estimation of quantities such as
position, velocity, voltage, current, etc. [18]. In addition, the findings of
Runge-Kutta technique can be directly used for the dynamic analyzes as in [18, 19].
In the following chapters, the applications of this technique will be given.
</p>
<p>After the initial drawings of the model harvester system, magnetostatic analyses
can be carried out. From magnetostatic solutions, the effects of magnetic sources,
magnetic fields can be found in detail in 3D media (see for instance Fig. 5.2).
</p>
<p>Note that the fields may increase at the vicinities of magnetic sources such as
magnets up to B = 1.1 T. The advantage of the 3D magnetostatic solution is that it
can give the field values at every solution region. Therefore the model can be
re-drawn easily for the best result. While the distance to a magnetic source is
adjusted, one should keep in mind that the piezoelectric beam should not be put
closer to the source. Since the magnetic force extremely increases, it can break the
beam. Thus the simulations can also give the resulting magnetic force in order to
estimate the optimal distance and save the laboratory materials with that respect.
</p>
<p>5.3 Experimental Techniques
</p>
<p>The setups in the piezoelectric energy harvester labs can include different equip-
ments from various research fields. Therefore experimental techniques may require
scientists from different fields such as acoustics, physics, electrical and computer

<p>engineering. The equipments, which are frequently used in the harvester studies can
be summarized as follows: Shaker, amplifier, laser displacement sensor and con-
troller, data acquation card, PC, oscilloscope, signal generator, magnets.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.3a&ndash;c shows the setup of piezoelectric shaker test. The shakers operate
with an amplifier in order to boost the amplitude of the vibration as in Fig. 5.3a.
The amplifier and the signal generator are used to excite the shaker for piezoelectric
tests. In some setups, a special package programme is used to excite the shaker. It
can be operated under a laptop and a specific frequency and amplitude can easily be

<p>adjusted via the package and it does not require any signal generator. However it
can increase the expenditures for such a setup. In Fig. 5.3b, c, the piezoelectric
mounted shaker and the laser displacement sensor (black coloured) are seen on top
of the system.
</p>
<p>Indeed the excitation signal which comes from a signal generator with a certain
frequency (generally 1&ndash;50 Hz) and amplitude (lower than 1 V peak to peak) is
increased in amplitude and directed to the shaker to produce certain displacements
at the tip of the piezoelectric beam. The vibration displacement can be adjusted by
the amplifier just by increasing the output amplitude. However, if a certain fre-
quency region will be sweeped, the amplitude should be constant for the experi-
mental sensitivity. Because any small increase or decrease in displacement at the
beam tip yields to different results, since the piezoelectrics are very sensitive to the
buckling. The shaker setup can be used for the testing of frequency responses of the
piezoelectric beams. When it vibrates the beam tip at certain frequencies f, the beam
would produce fluctuations between the negative and positive sides of the equi-
librium point. Figure 5.4 gives such a fluctuation on the laptop screen, if the
fluctuations are read by the laser displacement sensor and send via a DAQ card.
</p>
<p>For the interface of the laptop a LabView or other DAQ softwares can be used
efficiently. It is possible with recent equipments that the laser displacement sensor
and DAQ card can measure the vibrations with the sampling rate of 1 ms. This is a
good accuracy in order to measure the higher frequencies of these kind of systems.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.5 represents the results of a shaker test for three piezoelectric beams
with various lengths. While the vibration amplitude of the long beam becomes
large, the short one has small amplitude. In addition, the maximal amplitude, which

<p>refers to the maximum power, is obtained for different frequencies. The reason is
the difference in the natural frequencies of the beams due to their lengths. Similar to
pendulums, the length will increase the period of the vibration and the f is
decreased.
</p>
<p>In order to test the harvesters in a magnetic media, the following setup has been
proposed (Fig. 5.6). This system is different than the previous one, since there
exists magnetic excitation in place of a mechanical one.
</p>
<p>In this system, the response of the piezoelectric beam is tested for different
magnetic excitation. The setup can give opportunity to adjust the strenght and the
frequency of the magnetic field B. The electromagnet is responsible to generate the

<p>periodic B. The distance of electromagnet to the tip of the beam is important,
because the magnetic force strictly depends on the distance. The laser displacement
sensor, DAQ Card, rectifier and storage circuit and signal generator are the main
test equipments. Table 5.2 gives the experimental parameters of the equipments. In
order to create a mathematical expression on the magnetic field effect, the waveform
of the applied signal to the electromagnet is important. Such a problem will be
introduced in Sect. 5.5. The vibration amplitude and the distance are given by x
(t) and d, respectively. Note also that a non-ferromagnetic beam is adhered to the
piezoelectric beam tip in order to construct the desired length. The overall setup is
shown in Fig. 5.7.
</p>
<p>More than 500 thousand data points can be captured per second by the card in
this setup. All experimental outputs are gathered by the LabView software. To
determine the responses of harvester at different distances d to electromagnet, an
adjustable slide mechanism is utilized, thereby the electromagnet can be moved
forward and backward with respect to the beam tip. Throught the tests, input
voltages for the electromagnet can be sweeped between 6 and 10 V in order to

<p>change the magnetic force Fm(t). Note that the voltage directly influences the
current on the electromagnet. Since the electromagnet is an inductive load (XL), the
resulting waveform can change (see Sect. 5.5). The magnetic periodic force is
characterized as function of current Ic and the position of the piezoelectric layer
tip u.
</p>
<p>According to the test system, piezoelectric beam (sizes of 70 � 32 � 1.5 mm
and the weight of 10 g) produced by Piezo System Inc is used. The capacitance and
stiffness values of piezo-material are 232 nF and 188 N/m, respectively. The laser
displacement sensor has a IL-065 type head and a IL-1000 control unit made by
Keyence Inc. A rectifier and a storage circuit, a square pulse signal generating
circuit, and an NI USB-6250 DAQ unit are also included. The magnetic excitation
unit- the electromagnet has 1050 turns with 0.7 cm diameter copper wire.
A ferromagnetic core (sizes of 120 � 20 � 20 mm and the relative permeability of
&micro;r = 10,000) is used to increase the field density. The laser displacement sensor
which measures the vibration amplitude of the tip has a sensitivity of 4 &micro;m. It is
possible to get multiple records of different physical parameters such as vibration
amplitude and harvested voltages in the experiments, synchronously.
</p>
<p>5.4 Basic Methods of Nonlinear Analyses
</p>
<p>The nonlinearity in engineering systems is important in the sense that the
time-dependent systems can be out of stability by slight change in system param-
eters. Thus the estimated behavior cannot be observed and even it may affect the
overall results. Even in many systems such as converters [28, 29], RL-diode circuits
[30, 31], beams [19] the system can come out the controlled state and the behavior
of the physical quantities such as position, velocity, voltage, amplitude, current, etc.
becomes of randomized. Indeed the time-dependent change in these quantities may
lead to unpredictable values or periodic states with higher harmonics. At that point,
one requires a brief explanation on what the nonlinearity is. Figure 5.8 shows some
quantities as function of a variable.
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.8 Linearity and
nonlinearity of the quantities
</p>
<p>116 E. Kurt and Y. Uzun</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>While the line gives a linear behavior with respect to the variable (i.e. x-axis),
other two curves show complicated responses. Strictly speaking, the increase of
x-axis does not yield to simple linear formula (i.e. f(x) = ax), indeed it may have
higher order dependences to variable x such as x2, &minus;x3, ex, Sin(x), etc. A small
increase can yield to different results in f(x) function, thereby all these functions are
called as nonlinear [19, 32]. In many harvester systems, the quantities such as force,
voltage, magnetic field indicate such a behavior.
</p>
<p>There exist many tools to examine the results of a dynamic piezoelectric system.
The following parts give explanations on these tools:
</p>
<p>(a) Phase Space Construction (Attractor Formation): In any higher dimensional
system (i.e. higher than 1 variable), one can create a graph by putting one of the
variables to the x-axis and the other to the y-axis. This representation simply
gives the relation between these two variables (i.e. quantities) simultaneously.
Thus, if these variables have a closed well-defined curve in the phase space
representation, then one can identify the dynamics as &ldquo;periodic&rdquo;. Indeed a
periodic variable can have 2, 3 or more closed curves, then the periodicity is
called such as 2P, 3P, etc. by giving a few different frequency in the variable.
Figure 5.9 shows such an example.
If the phase space has no well-defined trajectory, indeed the output is assigned
as &ldquo;irregular&rdquo;. In such an attractor, the phase space fulls of many points and
their position always changes by time by filling the certain region of the phase
space. Beyond the quasi-periodic regime, these kinds of attractors are
encountered frequently and those are the indicator of strong unpredictability.
On the other hand, this irregular change in the variable is called as &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo;.
A representative example of such an attractor is shown in Fig. 5.10.
At first glance, the response of a dynamical system can be interpreted by
forming the attractors, easily. It is easy since there exists a fundamental dif-
ference between Figs. 5.9 and 5.10 and it really helps to get an idea on the
dynamic regimes.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(b) FFT Analysis: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is very-well known process on
the signal or image processing problems. It also finds broad application area in
power electronics, since the harmonics, sub-harmonics and super-harmonics
have importance on the design of a power electronics device. Indeed the
dynamics of an output from any system variable can be analyzed by FFT and
the frequency spectra can be identified in detail. From the analyses on the
piezoelectric beams, periodic, quasi-periodic or chaotic spectrum can be easily
understood. Mainly a chaotic output yields to a wide frequency spectra. It
means that the output has the combination of many individual frequencies.
Some of them can be larger than the main frequency f0, some others can be
smaller than f0. Many peaks in the FFT indicate the chaotic output of the
studied variables. On the other hand, the periodic output gives a basic FFT.
A main peak and a few frequencies (they can be sub- or super- harmonics).
Note that the peaks in a periodic FFT form can easily be identified, indeed it
does not become complicated. Figure 5.11a, b shows two experimental
examples on the FFTs from a piezoelectric beam.
</p>
<p>(c) Estimation of Lyapunov Exponents: Lyapunov exponents determine the
distance of the successive trajectories for a certain time evaluation in the phase
space [33]. It mainly considers the exponential difference from an initial state
for the system variables. Therefore the exponential change may increase the
distances of future successive trajectories or it may decrease it. Therefore the
logarithm of the ratio of the distances gives an idea how the variables improve
in the phase space. The expression,

function of time, it means that it has 3 exponentials for each variable. However,
the maximal exponential, which drives the overall system, is accepted as the
maximal Lyapunov exponent and it is responsible for the future of the system

<p>5.5 Nonlinear Analysis of the Piezoelectric Harvester
</p>
<p>Systems
</p>
<p>In this section, the nonlinear modeling procedure of some piezoelectric pendulum
system under the changeable magnetic field is explained. In our previous study (see
[19]), it was found that the vibrations of pendulum structures yield to many com-
plicated responses. Indeed, the elasticity, the magnetic field strength, distance to the
field source play important role to identify the dynamics. Initially, the pendulum
model under the periodic external field is considered. The model of the setup in is
given in Fig. 5.12.
</p>
<p>In this model, it is considered that the electromagnet generates a pulsed magnetic
field near the tip of beam. It has been known [19, 32] that the electromagnet can
create a static and inhomogeneous magnetic field near the tip of the beam.
Therefore, dynamics of the beam tip would include the elastic, gravitational and
magnetic forces. In the considered system, the elastic force is much higher than the
gravitational force since the mass of the system is small. With that respect, the
effects of elastic and magnetic forces can be considered dominantly [19, 32, 34]. All
forces which affect the tip can be summarized as in Fig. 5.13.
</p>
<p>Following our studies [19, 27, 32] the forces in Fig. 5.13 gives the system
equations. When the displacement x(t) occurs at the tip of the pendulum, it produces

<p>and internal mass displacement u(t) inside the piezoelectric material. Here,
Figs. 5.12 and 5.13 describe the system as a mass-spring, a damper and a capacitor.
In this system, the rigid mass mp and the stiffness constant k defines the mechanical
property under a damper c which denotes the mechanical losses. When the mass
displacement u occurs in the layer, current I and voltage V are generated. In this
case, the system equations is given by,

<p>In above expression, d transfers the coordinate system into the equilibrium point
of the beam. The vibration amplitude of the tip is represented by u.
</p>
<p>The main problem is to find out the expression of magnetic force. The best way
to find out the magnetic force expression, a magnetostatic analysis as similar to the
case in Ref. [27] should be realized. The field lines are shown in Fig. 5.14 at the
vicinity of the tip. Here, the Poisson SuperFish simulation package is used with
FEM. The magnetic force Fm increases near the electromagnet and affects the
ferromagnetic tip, dominantly. Flux density B decreases with the distance, thereby
the 2D simulation can find the effect of the distance.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.15 presents the results of the magnetostatic simulations. It has been
found that these variations can be fitted to a combined function depending on the
variables of u, Uc (i.e. Ic) and t. By considering Fig. 5.16, the overall nonlinear
expression can be considered as the functions of electromagnet voltage Uc and the
distance u,

<p>Here, d, Uc, Rc, L indicate the distance from the electromagnet to the pendulum
equilibrium, voltage, resistance and inductance of the electromagnet coil, respec-
tively. In the expression, the electromagnet force constants are defined as
a = 8 � 10&minus;8 and b = 10&minus;9 from the electromagnetic simulation.
</p>
<p>In order to simulate Eq. 5.6, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method can be used
efficiently in the MatLab media. In that case, the time dependent results for position,
velocity and voltage can be obtained. The main task is to fit the parameters of model
and experiment. For this reason, the responses of simulation should be compared by
the experimental findings. Therefore the damped results (without the magnetic
excitation) can be compared at first step to estimate the best parameter fit.
</p>
<p>From these graphs (Fig. 5.17), the natural period and frequency are found as
s = 0.210 s and f0 = 4.76 Hz. In addition, the damping constant is c = 1.48 and the
ratio of elastic constant to mass is k/m = 894. With the help of these parameters, the
simulations and experiments fit well. Moreover, this model can be used for finite
field values with the excitation frequencies.

field and the capacitance of the piezoelectric material, respectively.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.18 gives the experimental and theoretical results of the averaged power.
The resistive load about 1 MX gives the optimum power of the piezoelectric beam.
As in other electrical systems, the piezoelectric beam gives the maximal power
output when the load resistance equals to its internal empedance.
</p>
<p>It is obvious that the theoretical and experimental explorations give the same
value. In addition, power depends on the vibration amplitude with a higher order
polynomial function (see in Fig. 5.18b). With higher deflactions, much power is
obtained.
</p>
<p>5.6 Experimental and Theoretical Results of Nonlinearity
</p>
<p>In this part, the test results with respect to vibration amplitude, tip velocity and
output voltage are discussed. Figure 5.19a&ndash;c presents the dynamic responses of the
beam tip. It is understood that velocity has some ripples at the maximal values when
the tip is at the equilibrium point. The output voltage is not ideal sinusoidal,
however it has the same phase with the velocity. In Fig. 5.19d the phase plane
trajectories give ripples at minimal and maximal points of velocity as stated before.
This phase space representation shows these ripples much clear. Since an ideal
periodic motion yields to a simple circle or ellipse in the phase space, the ripples
here point out a non-regular dynamics even at the natural frequency of the system.
</p>
<p>It has been proven that these ripples are resulted by the magnetic field [27]. The
ripples cannot be related to any noisy data, because the external magnetic excitation
is very strong for the adjusted parameter set. Even in the theoretical formulation, it
yields to similar ripples. The spectral analysis shows that there exist some high
frequencies but low amplitude effects in the velocity data. It can have 88 Hz

<p>component and that explains the ripples occurring in a very short time scale. Strictly
speaking, the main frequency 4.7 Hz and other high frequency components such as
14.6, 26.3, 34.9 and 56.3 Hz are clearly seen in the spectrum (Fig. 5.19e).
</p>
<p>When the field frequency xm is increased to 6.09 Hz, the dynamics becomes
much complicated (Fig. 5.20a). Both the velocity and voltage shows ripples as in
Fig. 5.20b, c, however the vibration amplitude has still a sinusoidal character. In
addition to the main frequency 6.09 Hz, there exist infinite numbers of frequencies
in the spectrum as shown the inset of Fig. 5.20e. Some frequencies with larger
amplitudes can be summarized as follows: 24, 36, 54, 156, 256, 425, 452 Hz etc..
These frequencies produce many ripples as in Fig. 5.20d and dominate the phase
space. Thus the nonlinearity governs the dynamics for non-natural frequencies. On
the other hand, these high frequencies such as 425 and 452 Hz in the velocity data
are observed first time, experimentally in such a large-scale piezoelectric system to
our knowledge. This result proves how the nonlinearity is important for such
harvester systems and encourages us to obtain better power solutions for magnet-
ically excited systems. Although the vibration amplitude becomes sinusoidal, the
wide-band structure in velocity causes smooth power decay for different excitation
frequencies as will be shown later.

<p>lengths are low compared to the case in Fig. 5.19. The open circles on the
experimental data gives the Poincare section data, which is separated on the phase
space after the same time interval. The theoretical attractor, which was calculated
from Eq. 5.6 is shown in Fig. 5.21b and gives a good similarity to the experimental
one.
</p>
<p>The vibration amplitude of the beam tip becomes larger, when the field frequency
approaches to the natural frequency of the system (i.e. xm = x0 = 4.76 Hz). Thus
the frequencies near the natural frequency of the system are better to harvest much
energy from the system, since the voltage generated by the piezoelectric layer is
found to be dependent on the vibration amplitude. In Fig. 5.22, the attractors of
another parameter (i.e. xm = 6.02 Hz) are compared. The changeable character of
the magnetic flux can be seen in velocity fluctuations dominantly, whereas the
vibration amplitude gets smaller values compared to the earlier cases. The similarity
persists again between the theoretical and experimental findings. Note also the
distributed Poincare section points on the attractor in Fig. 5.22a.
</p>
<p>In addition to the similarities between the model system and the experimental
one, the harvester systems show another interesting phenomena called hardening
and softening effects. In Fig. 5.23, an example of this strange hysteresis bahaviour
is presented. Here, while the blue plot gives the maximal voltage when the exci-
tation field frequency is increased up step by step, the red plot gives the maximal
voltage when the frequency is decreased gradually.
</p>
<p>The frequency increase causes a harvesting effect with small amplitudes around
5 V (as in sweep up case) as in Fig. 5.23. But the frequency lowering beyond the
natural frequency causes three-fold voltage harvest in the softening effect. This
behavior is the result of the piezoelectric layer type. While some layers indicate
softening effect, others give hardening effect, where increasing frequency yields to
high amplitudes. As a result of these hysteresis effects, the excitation frequency

<p>should always change at the vicinity of natural frequency, where jumps in ampli-
tudes can be observed.
</p>
<p>5.7 The Dependence of Dynamics and Power to the System
</p>
<p>Parameters
</p>
<p>In this section, the parametrical dependence of power in pendulum-like harvesters
will be explained. For this aim, the dynamic feature of such a system can be
summarized by an intuitive bifurcation diagram (Fig. 5.24). Indeed, such diagram
can be produced by adjusting a parameter or two parameters on a plane. If one
parameter dependency is studied, it is called one-dimensional bifurcation diagram,
whereas two parameters are studied together on a parameter plane, it would be a
two-dimensional bifurcation diagram. The bifurcation data can be produced by
displacement, velocity or harvested voltage for successive parameter changes.
Therefore it is nothing else than the collection of many Poincare sections.
According to Fig. 5.24, the frequency values less than 4.8 Hz give regular dis-
placement values and a periodic behavior is observed. However beyond this value,
displacement values fluctuate between 0.4 and 1.4 cm till the excitation frequency
becomes 5.1 Hz. The displacement vibrations become regular (i.e. periodic) for
larger values. In the case of velocity (i.e. filled circles), the motion is much com-
plicated since the fluctuations does not decay to a certain velocity value for any
excitation frequency.

<p>Displacement and velocity data are represented by xn, and n gives the total data
point. It is interesting that there exist a good relation between RMS values of data
and the corresponding output power as in Fig. 5.25. Indeed, this relation can be
found for both experimental and theoretical data. All data can be fitted to a second
order formula, which states that power increases parabolically as function of dis-
placement and velocity rms data.
</p>
<p>This invention of this relation is new for magnetically-excited systems and it
gives a very clear result, which enables one to estimate output power just by
looking at rms data of displacement and velocity [18]. In Fig. 5.26, another
interesting result is given. The RMS values of displacement and velocity enables us
to determine the natural frequency of the harvester system. Both RMS displacement
and velocity data jumps at natural frequency. In this experiment, the natural fre-
quency is 4.76 Hz.

<p>One of the important concepts to measure the nonlinearity of time-dependent
data is the fluctuation amount. The nonlinearity of any fluctuation increases, when
different frequencies are included in the data. When one gets the amplitudes of
individual frequencies from the FFT result, a quantitative scaling can be obtained
for the data. This process is mainly described with the concept of total harmonic
distortion (THD) [17, 36]:

&eth;5:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>where A0 denotes the main frequency of the displacement or velocity data. Ai and Nf
denote other frequencies and the number of total frequencies in the FFT,
respectively.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 5.27a, b, the THD results of the data are presented as function of exci-
tation frequency. It is obvious that displacement fluctuations are smoother than
velocity fluctuations in Fig. 5.27b. The nonlinearity becomes 5 times powerful in
velocity fluctuations for some f values compared to the displacement fluctuations.
</p>

output power. (d = 2 cm, Uc = 8 V and the frequency changes between 4.25 and 6.53 Hz.)

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>While the maximal distortions are obtained at lower f for both displacement and
velocity, a contradiction occurs at the vicinity of natural frequency.
</p>
<p>Because the distortion in displacement increases up to 6 at the vicinity of f0, the
distortion in velocity stays lower near 15 at the same frequency. Note also that there
is a slightly decreasing character in THD of displacement (Fig. 5.27a). However, in
the case of velocity, THD increases for higher frequencies as seen in Fig. 5.27b.
Thus, these results prove that while the nonlinearity of displacement is generally
higher for the frequencies lower than natural frequency of the system, the nonlin-
earity of the velocity stays higher for lower and higher frequencies and becomes
lower at relatively medium frequencies. In order to find a relation between
displacement/velocity THD values and output power, Fig. 5.28 is depicted. While
the output power maximizes at f = 4.8 Hz, THD of velocity minimizes. Thus, it
proves that the power decreases when irregularity increase in the velocity data.
Whereas there is no significant correlation or anti-correlation between displacement
and power.
</p>
<p>From the electrical point of view, the resistive load RL and excitation frequency
f are important. In order to show this combined effect, Fig. 5.29 is presented.
</p>
<p>There exists a certain maximum for specific resistance and magnetic excitation
frequency. The output power of harvester becomes maximal, when f gets closer to
the natural frequency. While the dependence on the frequency is much strict in

<p>order to get the maximal output, the resistance dependence affects the output power
relatively low. Note that the resistance axis is in the logarithmic scale. Another
important result is that the harvester power shows the wider frequency region at its
same value for the resistive loads of 1 MX. Thus if one requires much stable output
for a wider range of excitation frequencies from the harvester, the load should be
adjusted at that value otherwise the maximal output can be generated at certain
parameters.

<p>5.8 Maximal Power Point Tracking Techniques
</p>
<p>for Piezoelectric Harvesters
</p>
<p>Parallel to the findings of previous section, a harvester gives the maximal power
generation for a specific vibration frequency and load (see in Fig. 5.29). Therefore
an efficient maximal power point tracking (MPPT) technique should be applied in
order to get the optimized energy. In the literature there exist various techniques for
the MPPT techniques [37&ndash;39]. Initially, it should be pointed out that surface
mounted devices (SMD) can be preferable to decrease the power loss in the circuit

<p>elements since they generate lW or mW scale powers. Figure 5.30 shows a general
circuit model with rectification, storage, MPPT and electrical load.
</p>
<p>The harvested signal is initially rectified and transferred to an MPPT circuit just
before the storage unit. Two recent MPPT techniques are mentioned below:
</p>
<p>1. DC/DC single inductor dual output (SIDO) control technique,
2. The single-supply pre-biasing (SSPB) technique.
</p>
<p>The SIDO control equipments and MPPT circuit diagram which are introduced
by Ramond et al. [37] is shown in Fig. 5.31. After the harvester part in the left
hand-side an AC/DC recitifier is first used as also refered in Fig. 5.30. Later, the
MPPT and controller part is added to the system for an optimized power control.
</p>
<p>In the MPPT part of Fig. 5.31, there is a certain voltage value called VMPP for
which the power PMPP is delivered maximal from the harvester. After this MPP,
the power decreases by the voltage increase until it reaches a value VOC, the Open
Circuit voltage of the harvester for which the harvested power is null. The main

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>function of this MPPT technique is to sample the open circuit voltage of the
harvester, periodically in order to provide a reference voltage to the DC/DC con-
verter. Indeed as shown in Table 5.3, the ratio VMPP/VOC is constant over the
whole vibration level range (0.1&ndash;0.5 g). Thus the DC/DC converter regulates the
harvester polarization voltage around VMPP leading to a maximal power emission
with an average efficiency of 95%.
</p>
<p>Consequently in order to achieve an optimal power, the micropower manage-
ment system should regulate the voltage of the harvester and place it close to the
MPP. According to literature, this kind of MPPT problem has been solved using the
charge pump or inductive DC/DC converters in order to isolate the piezoelectric
layer from heavy electrical load and enable to control the polarization of the source
independently of the load voltage (Fig. 5.32a). The solutions proposed by Yi et al.
[40] and Simjee and Chou [41] are interesting but all the power consumed by the

<p>load passes through the storage element and two converters (see in Fig. 5.32b),
which decrease the overall efficiency of the system.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.32c proposes another MPPT solution by providing a high efficiency
direct power path from the source to the load in addition to the MPPT scheme by
using a Single Inductor Dual Output (SIDO) DC/DC converter. The MPPT system
operates with the control circuit as in Fig. 5.31 as well. According to the findings of
Do et al. [42], the effect of an MPPT system can be seen in Fig. 5.33.
</p>
<p>The bell-shaped dotted curve shows the harvested power after the rectifier for
various ohmic loads. For the high loads then 200 kX, there exists a drametical
decrease in power as also shown in Fig. 5.29 in the previous section. However, the
MPPT system produces a much rough output for high loads and the output power is
nearly fixed around 70 lW.
</p>
<p>Other recently proposed MPPT technique is called as single-supply pre-biasing
(SSPB). According to Elliott and Mitcheson [39], their technique enables the
damping force to be set by a fixed voltage and by varying that voltage, real-time
adaptation to variations in the mechanical force can be implemented.
</p>
<p>Every half cycle of vibration, charge is placed on the piezoelectric material
which will induce a force opposing the motion of the piezoelectric material. This
tries to dampen the beam&rsquo;s motion, causing an increase in the harvested power.
SSPB changes the circuit from a velocity-damped resonant generator (VDRG) to a
Coulomb-damped resonant generator (CDRG) [43], enabling the level of damping
applied to be readily set by the pre-bias voltage, Vcc. At the piezoelectric beam&rsquo;s
extreme points, charge from the pre-biasing capacitor, Cbias, is transferred on to the
beam. This generates a Coulomb force to oppose the beam&rsquo;s vibration until it
reaches the opposite extreme position. The energy on the beam is then discharged
back into Cbias, and the process repeats. Similarly to the bridge rectifier, the
damping force can be optimally set by setting the voltage on the storage device in
order to achieve maximum power extraction,

<p>Here Q is the Q-factor of the resonant current discharge path through the
inductor and is the fraction of the magnitude of the voltage conserved on the
capacitor of an RLC oscillator with Q-factor after a half-cycle of the oscillator.
The system must detect a change in the piezoelectric induced voltage, quantify the
magnitude of the change, and operate an appropriate response. Since both the
bridge rectifier and SSPB techniques use a voltage on a bias capacitor to apply the
optimal conduction angle and damping force respectively, adding a buck converter
with battery enables the bias capacitor voltage to be independently set. The MPPT
scheme operates by adjusting the off-time of the buck converter causing the energy
on the bias capacitor to be more or less frequently transferred, resulting in a
decrease or increase in voltage respectively. Figure 5.34 shows the suggested
topology to adjust the voltage applied for the SSPB circuit. The voltage on the
biasing capacitor, Cbias, is controlled by varying the power transferred through the
buck converter. If the time between energy transfers is increased, Cbias voltage
would rise and a greater damping force is applied to the piezoelectric material. For
the implementation of the SSPB technique, the system requires three elements [39]:
A circuit to measure the harvested power, a controller to decide whether the power
has increased or decreased object to the previous measurement and a buck converter
to transfer the energy. In the design of these circuits, power consumption should be
minimised for the highest efficiency. Figure 5.35 gives the implementation to
demonstrate the MPPT technique.
</p>
<p>The measurement and control circuitry should operate at the lowest voltage
possible, but the voltage on the biasing capacitor maybe several times larger than
this. A potential divider can also be used by switching in across the biasing
capacitor during the operation (see in Fig. 5.35). The switch can be an n-type
MOSFET (BSS138), which can be driven by a low power FPGA (Igloo Nano). It
can also be used to implement the SSPB scheme [39]. A low power
Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC AD7468) can be used to measure the voltage
and a Booth Multiplier algorithm [44] on the FPGA can square the value.

<p>5.9 Conclusions
</p>
<p>In this chapter, the outlines of the dynamic explorations of the harvester systems
have been explained. Mainly, the 3D system modeling, electromagnetic analyses
and time-dependent simulations have been defined for the widely worked pendulum
system. While the 3D modeling of the system gives a clue on the electromagnetic
effects, especially the magnetic force steming from the permanent magnets or a
stable curring carrying winding play an important role to determine the dynamics. It
has been also proven that the distance between the magnetic or electrical souce
contributes to the nonlinear force term as well as the current flowing the electro-
magnet. The other parameters such as resistive load, electromagnet excitation fre-
quency and strength (i.e. current) dominate the dynamics and affect the harvested
power in the system. In parallel with the other systems in literature, the natural
frequency of the harvester causes maximum power generation. In fact, the non-
linearities in the velocity data for such periodic magnetic excited system subject to
decrease the power generation obviously, whereas there exists no remarkable effect
of the vibration amplitude on the output power. Considering the methodology of
dynamics, many applications of the pendulum-like harvester systems should be
realized and both theoretical and experimental explorations should be carried out
together in order to draw a complete picture of the applications. The chapter ends
with the recent proposed MPPT techniques in order to optimize the harvested power
from the piezoelectric systems.

<p>and low-pass filters are analyzed in order to evaluate their performance. The per-

<p>6.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In the last decades the solar energy is widely used as ambient energy that can be
</p>
<p>efficiently harvested and converted into electrical energy. The solar, wind and water
</p>
<p>energy are all ambient green energy resources without territorial restrictions, which
</p>
<p>can generate electrical energy via the Photovoltaic (PV) panels&rsquo; array, Wind
</p>
<p>Turbines&rsquo; (WT) farm and Hydro-Turbines (HT). The Energy Source (ES) shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 6.1 can represent a single source or a mix of renewable energy sources (such
</p>
<p>as PV array, WT farm, and HTs). The Fuel Cell (FC) stack can be used as an
</p>
<p>auxiliary energy source of the Hybrid Power Source (HPS) in order to minimize the
</p>
<p>Energy Storage System (ESS) if the HPS operates under high dynamic load.
</p>
<p>The DC loads will be connected on the ESS bus (directly or via a DC-DC con-
</p>
<p>verter) and the AC load via a DC-AC converter.
</p>
<p>The HPS architecture which will be analyzed in this chapter (see Sect. 6.2) is
</p>
<p>based on the generic HPS architecture shown in Fig. 6.1. Note that each ES will be
</p>
<p>connected to the ESS bus by an unidirectional DC-DC converter that is controlled
</p>
<p>using a Maximum Power Point (MPP) tracking algorithm [1]. The MPP tracking
</p>
<p>(MPPT) controller can control sequentially all ESs acquiring the samples of each
</p>
<p>ES current (iES) and the common ES voltage (vES) [2]. The MPP of each ES will be
</p>
<p>tracked using the Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) scheme that obtains the
</p>
<p>searching gradient based on the dithering action of the control loop [3].
</p>
<p>Both searching gradient and dither signals are parts of the reference current, iref.
</p>
<p>The reference current (iref) is compared with the ES current (iES) using an appro-
</p>
<p>priate current-mode control strategy to generate the switching pulses [4].
</p>
<p>If the HPS supplies a load that has a sharp and dynamic profile, then the ESS is
</p>
<p>necessary to assure the power flow balance on the ESS bus:
</p>

<p>pL &frac14; g � pES &thorn; pESS &eth;6:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>The ESS power is given by (6.2):
</p>
<p>pESS &frac14; pL � g � pES &eth;6:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>The ES power depends on the environmental and weather conditions, so it is
</p>
<p>difficult to dynamically compensate the power flow balance by controlling the fuel
</p>
<p>flow rates of the FC stack [5, 6]. Consequently, a hybrid ESS (of batteries and
</p>
<p>ultracapacitors connected with DC-DC converters to the ESS bus [7]) must be
</p>
<p>designed to minimize the cost of the HPS. The ESS will be charged and discharged
</p>
<p>during a load cycle and the average ESS power, PESS(AV), can be zero, positive or
</p>
<p>negative if the ESS operates in charge-sustaining (CS), charge-increasing (CI) or
</p>
<p>charge-depletion (CD) mode, respectively [8, 9].
</p>
<p>The Energy Management Strategies (EMSs) proposed in the literature are
</p>
<p>dependent to HPS application. For example, the EMS is applied to the HPS used as
</p>
<p>the Distributed Generation (DG) unit in the smart grids [10] or as the energy source
</p>
<p>for the power-train of the hybrid vehicles [8]. The EMS of the load-following type
</p>
<p>[9] will operate the ESS in CS mode based on the FC power controlled to assure the
</p>
<p>averaged power flow balance:
</p>
<p>PFC&eth;AV&THORN; &frac14; PL&eth;AV&THORN; � g � PES&eth;AV&THORN; &eth;6:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>The FC stack is efficiently operated based on the efficiency map [11] or the
</p>
<p>Maximum Efficiency Point (MEP) tracking algorithm [12, 13].
</p>
<p>If the EMS is not of load-following control type, then the ESS will operate in CI
</p>
<p>or CD mode by controlling the ESS charger (the bidirectional DC-DC converter)
</p>
<p>based on the charging ES factor (kES) and the regenerative load factor (kL) defined
</p>
<p>as following [9]:
</p>
<p>kES &frac14; PES!ESS&eth;AV&THORN; =PES&eth;AV&THORN; &eth;6:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>kL &frac14; PL!ESS&eth;AV&THORN; =PL&eth;AV&THORN; &eth;6:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>PES!ESS&eth;AV&THORN; is the part of the ES power flow that charge the ESS;
</p>
<p>PL!ESS&eth;AV&THORN; is the reverse power flow from the regenerative load that charge the
</p>
<p>ESS.
</p>
<p>The ESS charger usually has the plug-in feature, so choosing between the CI
</p>
<p>mode or CD mode will depend by the price of the energy offered at the plug-in units
</p>
<p>during the route [9].
</p>
<p>The energy must be harvested from each ES and the FC stack must be operated
</p>
<p>at MEP in order to optimize the HPS operation. In this chapter the PV HPS opti-
</p>
<p>mization based on an ESC scheme is analyzed. The perturbed ESC scheme will
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>track the MPP of the PV panel (see Fig. 6.2) or the Global MPP (GMPP) of the PV
</p>
<p>array.
</p>
<p>Besides the ESC scheme, different MPPT techniques have been proposed during
</p>
<p>the last decades. These techniques can be categorized as direct and indirect methods
</p>
<p>to maximize the power generated by an energy source that has a power charac-
</p>
<p>teristic with one maximum [1, 14]. The power characteristic of the solar cells is
</p>
<p>modeled using mathematical equations [15] or numerical approximations [16].
</p>
<p>The MPP tracking performance is dependent on the resolution of the
</p>
<p>analog-to-digital converter [17] and the cut-off frequencies of the low-pass filter
</p>
<p>(LPF) [18]. The Perturb &amp; Observe (P&amp;O) and Incremental Conductance (IC)
</p>
<p>methods are the most used MPPT algorithms implemented in the commercial
</p>
<p>controllers [19]. The P&amp;O method uses a perturbation of the PV voltage or PV
</p>
<p>current to search the MPP by observing the sense of the variation of the PV power.
</p>
<p>The step size of the perturbation must be carefully designed to balance the tradeoffs
</p>
<p>between the performance indicators (the search speed and tracking accuracy),
</p>
<p>assuring in meantime the robustness to variability of the irradiance [20, 21]. The
</p>
<p>irradiance profile during a sunny-cloudy day has a dynamic shape in reality, so a
</p>
<p>model of this profile is usually used in simulation [21].
</p>
<p>This chapter analyzes three ESC schemes to compare the performance of the
</p>
<p>MPPT process. The modified ESC (mESC) scheme (see Fig. 6.3) has improved
</p>
<p>performance in comparison with the high-order ESC (hoESC) scheme (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.4) related to the search speed if high cut-off frequency of the band-pass filter
</p>
<p>(BPF) is higher than that of the LPF. The low cut-off frequency of the BPF may be
</p>
<p>the same with that of the high-pass filter (HPF). It can be noted that the tracking

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>accuracy remains almost the same [22], where the MPP tracking accuracy is defined
</p>
<p>as 100 � (PPV / PMPP) [%], PMPP being the power of the PV panel operating at the
MPP and PPV the power harvested from the PV panel via DC-DC converter under
</p>
<p>the MPPT controller. The 99.8% tracking accuracy could be obtained with
</p>
<p>advanced MPPT algorithms (which decrease the level of perturbation close to
</p>
<p>MPP). An adaptive decrease of the perturbation is used in the advanced ESC
</p>
<p>(aESC) scheme proposed in [21]. The 99.99% tracking accuracy could be obtained
</p>
<p>without reducing the search speed and response time to irradiance changes.
</p>
<p>The generic topologies of the mESC and hoESC schemes will be detailed in the
</p>
<p>next sections for the Photovoltaic Hybrid Power Source (PVHPS) application. It is
</p>
<p>obvious that the performance inherited from the basic hoESC scheme (such as a
</p>
<p>guaranteed convergence and an internal robustness) is taken up as well [23].
</p>
<p>The ESC schemes can be used to search the unknown maximum of the PV power
</p>
<p>characteristic because it is a control method of adaptive type [24, 25].
</p>
<p>Also, it is easy to show that the mESC and hoESC schemes are functionally
</p>
<p>equivalent if the cut-off frequencies of the BPF are the same with those of the HPF
</p>
<p>and LPF (see Fig. 6.5). This will be briefly shown in next section based on the
</p>
<p>specific ESC schemes for the PVHPS [5, 26].
</p>
<p>The chapter is organized as follows. Section 6.2 briefly presents the architecture
</p>
<p>of the PVHPS. The modeling of the PVHPS is presented in Sect. 6.3, where the
</p>
<p>models of the solar cell, PV panel, boost converter, and ESC schemes used in
</p>
<p>simulation are shown. Section 6.4 deals with the performance analysis of the ESC
</p>
<p>schemes. The analysis in frequency domain of the ESC loop is performed here in
</p>
<p>order to evaluate the performance of the ESC schemes under step-up in the irra-
</p>
<p>diance profile. The dither persistence on the ESC loop is also approached here.
</p>
<p>The PVHPS behavior under variable irradiance profile is shown in Sect. 6.4 using
</p>
<p>the mESC and aESC schemes in Sect. 6.6.

<p>6.2 Architecture of the Photovoltaic Hybrid Power Source
</p>
<p>The Photovoltaic Hybrid Power Source (PVHPS) architecture is shown in Fig. 6.6,
</p>
<p>where the main subsystems are detailed by the diagram implemented in
</p>
<p>Matlab-Simulink&reg;. The dynamic load is connected on the ESS DC bus and the ESS
</p>
<p>is implemented using a passive topology [7]. A simple current-mode hysteretic
</p>
<p>controller is used here to generate the switching command for the boost converter.
</p>
<p>The boost converter is usually used as a DC-DC power interface between the
</p>
<p>low DC voltage of the ES (here the PV voltage) and the high DC voltage (VDC) of
</p>
<p>the common DC bus for ESS and inverter system [14, 27]. If the voltage inverter
</p>
<p>system is grid connected, then the switching command must be synchronized with
</p>
<p>the grid frequency and the harmonics of the inverter and the grid voltages must
</p>
<p>have the same magnitude [28]. Thus, the low frequency (LF) and high frequency
</p>
<p>(HF) ripple having harmonics at multiples of the grid frequency and switching
</p>
<p>frequency will appear on the DC bus. The LF ripple by three harmonics is con-
</p>
<p>sidered in the load model because only these are important to analyze the ESC
</p>
<p>control loop. It is known that the ripple correlation method can use both LF and HF
</p>
<p>ripple of the PV power signal (PPV) [29], but the natural inverter ripple is usually
</p>
<p>utilized by the perturbed MPPT algorithms based on the P&amp;O methods [30] or the
</p>
<p>ESS schemes [31].

<p>6.3.3 The ESC Schemes
</p>
<p>The ESC schemes used in this chapter will be briefly presented here.
</p>
<p>6.3.3.1 The hoESC Scheme
</p>
<p>The hoESC scheme shown in Fig. 6.1 is adapted for PVHPS as in Fig. 6.7. The
</p>
<p>HPF is necessary to extract the useful LF harmonics from the PV power signal and
</p>
<p>the LPF to reduce the HF noise [32].
</p>
<p>The information about the searching gradient is obtained by using a dither
</p>
<p>signal, kA�sin(2pfdt) (kA being the amplitude, fd the dither frequency and t the time),
injected in the ESC control loop. A compromise must to be made between the
</p>
<p>choosing of the design parameters (k1 and k1 gains) to obtain good performance for
</p>
<p>both indicators: the search speed and the tracking accuracy. The search speed can
</p>
<p>be increased if the cut-off frequency of the LPF is set about 5-times higher than the
</p>
<p>dither frequency. If the series connection of the HPF and LPF is replaced with an
</p>
<p>equivalent BPF, then the modified ESC (mESC) scheme will be obtained (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.8).
</p>
<p>Note that the cut-off frequencies of the LPF and HPF used in hoESC scheme are
</p>
<p>usually set as xl(ho) = bl(ho)x, 0 &lt; bl(ho) &lt; 1, and xh(ho) = bh(ho)x, 0 &lt; bh(ho) &lt; 1.
</p>
<p>6.3.3.2 The Modified ESC Scheme
</p>
<p>The modified ESC scheme is shown in Fig. 6.8. The search speed of the mESC
</p>
<p>scheme increases about 2-times in comparison with the hoESC scheme if the same

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>k1 and k1 gains are used for both mESC and hoESC schemes, but the cut-off
</p>
<p>frequency of BPF high is set bl(m)-times higher than dither frequency (xl(m) = bl
</p>
<p>(m)x, 3 &lt; bl(m) &lt; 6) [26].
</p>
<p>The HPF removes the average value of the PV power, so the low cut-off fre-
</p>
<p>quency of the HPF and BPF can be set the same for the both ESC schemes:
</p>
<p>xh = bhx, 0 &lt; bh &lt; 1.
</p>
<p>It is known that a large value of the k2 gain will increase the search speed, but the
</p>
<p>tracking accuracy is depreciated. A high power ripple will appear even during the
</p>
<p>stationary phase (constant irradiance). Thus, the k1 gain must be higher during the
</p>
<p>transitory phase (change of the irradiance level) and very small during the stationary
</p>
<p>phase. This can be obtained by using the advanced ESC (aESC) scheme, where the
</p>
<p>dither injected has the amplitude modulated with the first harmonic (H1) of the PV
</p>
<p>power: kA = A�k2�H1 (see Fig. 6.9).
</p>
<p>6.3.3.3 The Advanced ESC Scheme
</p>
<p>The advanced ESC (aESC) scheme is shown in Fig. 6.9, and its equivalent
</p>
<p>(EQaESC) topology based on HPF and LPF in series is shown in Fig. 6.10.
</p>
<p>It is obvious that all the ESC schemes (hoESC, mESC, and aESC schemes) will
</p>
<p>have the same equivalent operating equations (see for example [21, 26]):

<p>and (6.16) represent the signal processing in aESC and EQaESC schemes based on

<p>BPF and series connection of HPF and LPF, respectively.
</p>
<p>The following notations are used for all ESC schemes (see Figs. 6.7, 6.8, 6.9 and
</p>
<p>6.10):
</p>
<p>&bull; k1 is the loop gain;
</p>
<p>&bull; kA is the dither&rsquo;s amplitude (kA = A�k2 for the hoESC and mESC schemes, and
kA = H1�A�k2 for the aESC scheme);
</p>
<p>&bull; H1 is the magnitude of the first harmonic of the PV power;
</p>
<p>&bull; xl = blx is the cut-off frequency of the LPF (0 &lt; bl(ho) &lt; 1 for hoESC scheme,
</p>
<p>and 1 &lt; bl(m) &lt; 6 for the mESC and aESC schemes);
</p>
<p>&bull; xh = bhx, 0 &lt; bh &lt; 1, is the cut-off frequency of the HPF for all ESC schemes;
</p>
<p>&bull; A and fd = x/2p are the amplitude and frequency of the dither signal;
</p>
<p>&bull; i1, i2, and i3 are the signals after normalization block, HPF, and LPF blocks (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.9 and the Eqs. (6.14)&ndash;(6.16));
</p>
<p>&bull; iHPF is an intermediate variable related to the HPF operating;
</p>
<p>&bull; iBPF is the output signal from the BPF;

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; i4 is the signal that estimates the unknown parameter;
</p>
<p>&bull; VMPP is voltage on the MPP;
</p>
<p>&bull; IPV0 is the initial value for the PV current.
</p>
<p>Note that A = 1 and IPV0 = 0 for all simulations presented in this chapter.
</p>
<p>So, the k1 gain can be set higher (up to the stability limit) in order to have search
</p>
<p>speed up to the save value of HPS operating, without affecting the tracking accu-
</p>
<p>racy. It was shown in [26] that the performance of the aESC scheme is better than
</p>
<p>that obtained with the extended Kalman-filter used for gradient estimation [32].
</p>
<p>Thus, the main feature of the aESC scheme is related to its capability to set
</p>
<p>independently the performance indicators for each HPS application. The ESC
</p>
<p>schemes will be analyzed in next section.
</p>
<p>6.4 Performance Analysis of the ESC Schemes
</p>
<p>The comparative performance is performed in this section based on the analysis in
</p>
<p>the frequency domain of the ESC loop. The analytical results will be validate by a
</p>
<p>simulation using the testing diagram shown in Fig. 6.11.
</p>
<p>6.4.1 The Analysis in Frequency Domain of the ESC Loop
</p>
<p>The searching of the MPP on the power characteristic is mainly the same for all the
</p>
<p>ESC schemes considered here, being based on dither-pertubed search (see Fig. 6.2).

<p>&bull; The search speed at t = 0.05 s is about 450 and 300 Ws&minus;1 for the mES and
</p>
<p>hoESC schemes, so the ratio is 450/300 = 1.5. The theoretical value given by
</p>
<p>(6.40) is about 2.2. This difference could be explained based on simple
</p>
<p>assumptions considered in obtaining the relationship (6.40), which estimates this

<p>rate at the dither frequency. It can be observed that the LF spectrum of the i4
signal is different for the mESC and hoESC scheme (see plot 3 in Fig. 6.15).
</p>
<p>The dither persistence is improved for the mESC scheme [26]. This aspect will
</p>
<p>be briefly analyzed in Sect. 6.4.5 to clearly highlight the role of harmonics in the
</p>
<p>ESC loop.
</p>
<p>&bull; The difference between the shapes of the PV power during the searching phase
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 6.15, top plot) is about 5 J, which means an additional power har-
</p>
<p>vested of about 5 J/0.2 s = 25 W from the PV module (SX60 type having PMPP
&cong; 51.2 W) if the mESC scheme is used.
</p>
<p>6.4.4 On the Performance of the aESC and mESC Schemes
</p>
<p>The main difference between the mESC scheme and the aESC scheme is related to
</p>
<p>the dither gain, which is constant, kA(m) = A�k2, and time variable, kA(a) = A�k2�H1,
respectively, where H1 is the magnitude of first harmonic of the PV power. So, the
</p>
<p>searching speed for aESC and mESC schemes are given by (6.41) and (6.42) [21]:

</p>
<p>	cos&eth;/BPF&eth;a&THORN;&THORN; = &eth;2VMPP&THORN; &eth;6:42&THORN;
</p>
<p>If the same design parameters will be used for the aESC and mESC schemes (k1
</p>
<p>(a) = k2(m) and GBPF(a) = GBPF(m)), then the ratio of searching speeds will be:
</p>

</p>
<p>If the S1 saturation block has the limits 0 and 1, then kA(a) = kA(m) during the
</p>
<p>searching phase (when H1 &gt; 1) and kA(a) = H1kA(m) if the MPP was located and
</p>
<p>H1 &lt; 1. The H1 magnitude is very small close to MPP, so the PV power ripple is
</p>
<p>negligible during the stationary phase and the MPP is found accurately (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.16, where the magnitudes of the first three harmonics (H1, H2, and H3) of the
</p>
<p>PV power are shown).
</p>
<p>Note that the searching speed will be H1-times higher for the aESC scheme in
</p>
<p>comparison with the mES scheme if the S1 saturation block has the upper limit set
</p>
<p>to infinit.
</p>
<p>The magnitude of H1 and its mean value are shown in the first plot of Fig. 6.16.
</p>
<p>The magnitude of H2 and H3 is shown in next plots. The PV power during the
</p>
<p>MPP searching process is shown in plot 4 of Fig. 6.16 and the zoom shows the
</p>
<p>tracking accuracy. The search speed is about 200 W/s (see plot 4 of Fig. 6.16) if the
</p>
<p>values used for the k1 and k2 gains are set to 400 and 0.8, and A = 0.2.
</p>
<p>The effect of amplitude limitation of the dither used for the aESC scheme is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 6.17.

<p>If this type of limited dither is used for the aESC scheme, then the ratio of the
</p>
<p>searching speeds (6.43) will be 1 during the searching phase. This result is validated
</p>
<p>by simulation (see first plot in Fig. 6.18, where almost the same search speed is
</p>
<p>obtained for both mESC and aESC schemes). The search speed is about 800 W/s
</p>
<p>because k1 = 1,600 is 4-times higher than the previous value used in Fig. 6.16, and
</p>
<p>the saturation block (S1) is used to limit the H1 magnitude of the iBPF signal at 0.2
</p>
<p>(which is also the amplitude of the dither used in both ESC schemes), then the
</p>
<p>search speed will be the same for the both ESC techniques (about 800 W/s; see
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.10).
</p>
<p>The MPP tracking accuracy for the both control schemes is highlighted in the
</p>
<p>zooms from the right side of Fig. 6.18. The power ripple has a decreasing and
</p>
<p>constant magnitude of ripple for the aESC and mESC schemes. This validates the
</p>
<p>ratio of the searching speeds (6.43) that is H1 during the stationary phase. Note that
</p>
<p>the H1 magnitude decreases to a very small value during the stationary phase (see
</p>
<p>the last plot in Fig. 6.16).
</p>
<p>The PV panel without control (see Fig. 6.13) is used as reference to compute the
</p>
<p>MPP value for 500 W/m2 irradiance level, the zooms are used to evaluate the
</p>
<p>performance indicators for both ESC schemes. The performance evaluated based on
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.18 are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; The search speed is almost the same for both ESC techniques if H1 magnitude is
</p>
<p>limited at 1; the search speed using the aESC scheme is H1&mdash;times higer than
</p>
<p>that using the mESC scheme (see simulations shown in Sect. 6.5).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; The MPP tracking accuracy using the mESC scheme is about 99% (because 1%
</p>
<p>&cong;100% (51.4 &minus; 50.9)/2 
 51.4) and lower than 0.1% if the aESC scheme is
used;
</p>
<p>&bull; The power ripple during stationary phase is about 0.5 Wp-p (= 51.4 &minus; 50.9) and
</p>
<p>negligible for mESC scheme and aESC scheme;
</p>
<p>6.4.5 On the Dither Persistence on the ESC Loop
</p>
<p>The dither persistence on the ESC loop will be analyzed using the following
</p>
<p>simplifying assumptions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Ideal HPF and LPF;
</p>
<p>&bull; Unitary value for kN and kT gains;
</p>
<p>&bull; Initial value for the /k is set to zero;
</p>
<p>&bull; xd � xh(ES), where xh(ES) is the cut-off frequency of the Energy Source (ES)
transfer function.
</p>
<p>The dither will not interact with the ES dynamic based on last assumption, so the
</p>
<p>ES power signal will result as harmonics&rsquo; superposition based on the ES static
</p>
<p>characteristic (see Fig. 6.2) and, for example, the EQmESC scheme (Fig. 6.3). The
</p>
<p>first three harmonics will be considered for the iref(LF) signal:
</p>
<p>iref &eth;LF&THORN; &frac14;
X
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>k&frac14;1
</p>
<p>Iref &eth;k&THORN; sin&eth;kxd t&thorn;/k&THORN; &eth;6:44&THORN;
</p>
<p>So, the reference current, iref, will be given by (6.45):
</p>
<p>iref &eth;t&THORN; &frac14; Iref &thorn; iref &eth;LF&THORN;&eth;t&THORN; ffi Iref &thorn; a1 � sin&eth;xd t&THORN;
</p>
<p>&thorn; a2 � sin&eth;2xdt&THORN;&thorn; a3 � sin&eth;3xdt&THORN;
&eth;6:45&THORN;
</p>
<p>The power response, pES, to one harmonic can be approximated by the Taylor
</p>
<p>series:
</p>
<p>pES&eth;iref &THORN; &frac14; PESjIref &thorn; _pES&eth;iref &THORN; � Iref &thorn; ak � sin k � xd � t&eth; &THORN;

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Also, the i5(LF) harmonics will be evaluated based on signal processing related to
</p>
<p>ESC loop considering the reference current given by (6.45) as dither. The shapes of
</p>
<p>i5(LF) harmonics are shown in Fig. 6.20. The minor differences appear close to the
</p>
<p>MPP due to high distortion of the dither (which means more harmonics in the
</p>
<p>simulated ESC loop.
</p>
<p>The conclusion is that the searching speed is proportional to a linear combination
</p>
<p>of the first and third derivative of the pES power, besides the ESC loop gain (k1) and
</p>
<p>the dither amplitude (A). Consequently, the search speed is dependent to the pass
</p>
<p>band set for the BPF of the mESC and aESC schemes.
</p>
<p>The performance of the PVHPS under variable irradiance profile and constant
</p>
<p>load will be analyzed below for both mESC and aESC schemes.
</p>
<p>6.5 The PVHPS Using the ESC Schemes
</p>
<p>6.5.1 Testing the mESC Scheme
</p>
<p>The variable irradiance profile (■) of step-up stairs type is shown in Fig. 6.21.
</p>
<p>The MPP searching process is also shown in P-I phase plane (see Fig. 6.21). The
</p>
<p>simulation diagram was that from Fig. 6.6. The MPPs are tracked with a small
</p>
<p>ripple by using the mESC scheme (see the zooms on Fig. 6.22).
</p>
<p>The MPPs tracking is also shown in the first plot of Fig. 6.21, where the PV
</p>
<p>power (●) has the same MPPs as in Fig. 6.22. The ESS voltage (■) and the ESS
</p>
<p>power (●) are shown in the second plot of Fig. 6.21. The ESS power is given by
</p>
<p>(6.2). So for a constant load of 50 W and variable PV power, the ESS will com-
</p>
<p>pensate the power flow balance on the DC bus.
</p>
<p>The power ripple is about 2 Wp-p (see zooms on Fig. 6.22), which means a
</p>
<p>normalized ripple of about 2/51 &cong; 4%, but this can be reduce further if the aESC
</p>
<p>scheme will be used instead of mESC scheme.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.5.2 Testing the aESC Scheme
</p>
<p>The irradiance profile is step-up and -down type (see Fig. 6.23, plot 1). The fol-
</p>
<p>lowing plots are shown in Fig. 6.23:
</p>
<p>&bull; Plot 1: the irradiance sequence ( ) and the PV current, iPV ( );

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Plot 2: the PV power ( ) and the H1 magnitude of the first harmonic of the iBPF
signal( );
</p>
<p>&bull; Plot 3: the ESS power ( ) and the voltage on DC bus ( ).
</p>
<p>It can be observed that the search speed under aESC scheme is H1-times higher
</p>
<p>than the search speed under mESC scheme. The H1 magnitude increases quickly to
</p>
<p>any variation in the irradiance level (see Fig. 6.23, plot 2). The power ripple is also
</p>
<p>negligible during the stationary phase, after the MPP is located (see Fig. 6.23, plot
</p>
<p>2). Consequently, the performance of the aESC scheme is better than that of the
</p>
<p>mESS scheme.
</p>
<p>The ESS will operate in charge depletion mode to assure the power flow balance
</p>
<p>on the DC bus when the PV power is lower than the load (see Fig. 6.23, plot 3&mdash;the
</p>
<p>period when the irradiance level is lower that 500 W/m2). The DC bus remain
</p>
<p>almost constant around 50 V set by the ESS battery voltage (see Fig. 6.23, plot 3).
</p>
<p>The PVHPS behavior under the aESC scheme was tested in Matlab-Simulink&reg;
</p>
<p>for different irradiance and load profiles. The following performance may be high-
</p>
<p>lighted (see Table 6.2): (1) the robust tracking of the MPP under irradiance profile as
</p>
<p>in reality; (2) the search speed could be set higher than 1 kW/s; (3) the tracking
</p>
<p>accuracy is higher than 99.99%; (4) a negligible ripple during the stationary phase.
</p>
<p>6.6 Conclusion
</p>
<p>In this chapter some analytical results related to the new ESC schemes are high-
</p>
<p>lighted. The mESC scheme based on BPF was proposed to improve the search
</p>
<p>speed: this is about twice in comparison with that obtained with the hoESC scheme.

<p>Anyway, the PV power ripple remains the same for the both mESC and hoESC
</p>
<p>schemes analyzed. The PV power ripple can be reduced by using the aESC scheme
</p>
<p>that has the following performance (see Sect. 6.4.5): (1) the tracking accuracy is
</p>
<p>higher than 99.99%, (2) the PV power ripple is negligible during the stationary
</p>
<p>phase after the MPP is located; the aESC search speed is H1&mdash;times higher that
</p>
<p>mESC search speed; (3) the aESC search speed can be set independently (up to a
</p>
<p>safe value of PVHPS operation) in order to obtain high tracking accuracy during the
</p>
<p>transitory phase as well; (4) the aESC-based MPPT control is robust to irradiance
</p>
<p>profiles such as in reality; (5) the aESC-based MPPT control is simple to be
</p>
<p>implemented.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the aESC scheme slightly outperforms the mESC scheme in total
</p>
<p>power efficiency of the PVHPS.

</p>
<p>Abstract Due to both reduction and insufficient of fossil fuel to supply current
</p>
<p>growing energy needs, investigation and employing of renewable resources has
</p>
<p>been accelerated. Besides, using fossil fuel affected the environment negatively.
</p>
<p>Therefore, renewable energy resources in the most studies are solar, wind and
</p>
<p>geothermal. In this study, electrical energy production methods from solar energy
</p>
<p>have been examined, a fixed and a two axis tracking system have been designed.
</p>
<p>Both systems are compared each other regarding to several factors by performing
</p>
<p>annual measurements. Energy consumption of the system is minimized by
</p>
<p>employing actuator motor in two axis solar tracking system. According to the
</p>
<p>efficiency of two-axis tracking system, the annual average has been calculated as
</p>
<p>31.67% more. This efficiency has been calculated as 70% in winter, 11% in
</p>
<p>summer. As a result of these measurements several graphics of a year empirically
</p>
<p>daily, monthly and annual data have been contributed to the literature for
</p>
<p>Diyarbakir, one of the prominent cities of Southern east, having the most solar
</p>
<p>energy of Turkey. In the first section, literature review will be indicated. In the
</p>
<p>second section, solar angles, photovoltaic panels and systems, sample designs and
</p>
<p>solar tracking systems are examined. In the third section, photovoltaic two-axis
</p>
<p>solar tracking system and qualifications, work and advantages of fixed system
</p>
<p>which we designed are stated. In following section, obtained results will be given
</p>
<p>and in last section, financial analysis of fixed and tracking photovoltaic systems has
</p>
<p>been performed. Also, recommendations for increasing their efficiency have been

<p>7.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Importance of energy needed today in every area of life becomes increasing. Energy
</p>
<p>is the main input for our civilization and its production and consumption is one of
</p>
<p>the reliable merits to measure the improvement and development of the country.
</p>
<p>Studies on finding and developing alternative energy resources have been
</p>
<p>accelerated as a result of insufficiency of existing resources to provide constantly
</p>
<p>increasing energy need. Yet, traditional energy production and consumption
</p>
<p>methods, especially fossil fuel based ones, lead to unrecoverable environmental
</p>
<p>damages. Saving the living environment on earth and decreasing the environmental
</p>
<p>damage caused by energy production and consumption beneath the damage caused
</p>
<p>by climate change give responsibility to all humankind. As a result of this
</p>
<p>responsibility; preparing national and international legal regulations, prioritizing the
</p>
<p>environmental effects in selection of energy production technology and resources
</p>
<p>and giving maximum effort in efficiently using energy are gaining much more
</p>
<p>importance by the time.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, instead of using traditional and fossil fuel based energy
</p>
<p>production systems which are causing worldwide environmental pollution and
</p>
<p>climate change, finding energy resources and developing new technologies pro-
</p>
<p>viding sustainability and renewability and causing less environmental damage and
</p>
<p>climate change became necessary. Both of the facts that fossil fuel resources are
</p>
<p>limited and their production and consumption systems cause environmental damage
</p>
<p>led to investigate renewable, unlimited and environmental friendly energy resources
</p>
<p>and technologies. So, renewable energy resources including solar energy gained
</p>
<p>importance [1, 2].
</p>
<p>Solar energy with the characteristics such as its potential, cleanliness, renewa-
</p>
<p>bility, easy-to-use and being environmental friendly features has much more
</p>
<p>probability to become widespread when compared with other renewable energy
</p>
<p>resources. Overcoming it limitations such as having higher setup cost, having less
</p>
<p>efficiency and capacity will make it more attractive at the future. Unfortunately,
</p>
<p>Turkey could not use today all its potential even though it has a favorable position
</p>
<p>from solar energy perspective.
</p>
<p>Solar energy is vast and also does not damage environment. This makes it a
</p>
<p>good choice in this consumption era as most known energy sources have becoming
</p>
<p>exhausted and some complications are occurred such as corrosion in living world
</p>
<p>and climate changes. However, there are different opportunities which allow us fix
</p>
<p>the situation. One of these opportunities and also the most convenient one is to find
</p>
<p>out the new and clean energy sources. Another opportunity is to reduce the amount
</p>
<p>of consumed energy.
</p>
<p>Nuclear energy has first considered as sharp cut solution but having high hazard
</p>
<p>risk and changing nearby habitat made it less preferable. On the other hand, sun has
</p>
<p>much more potential as it has not such kind of disadvantages. Available energy on

<p>the world produced by sun is in 152,424 � 1013 kWh while total energy produced
by power plants is 100 thousand times less and produced solar energy on earth is 15
</p>
<p>thousand times less as seen in Fig. 7.1. Thus, today solar energy systems have
</p>
<p>begun to be used in every part of life even though solar energy is intended to use
</p>
<p>after the second half of our century [1&ndash;12].
</p>
<p>At the present time, utilization of solar energy becomes significant in almost
</p>
<p>every country as there are many different application areas. It is used in providing
</p>
<p>hot water or heating house. Also, it is converted into electrical energy and then used
</p>
<p>in lighting of buildings, for propulsion of cars and even for assisting to grow crops
</p>
<p>by the help of solar water pumps. In last 20 years, new technologies are improved
</p>
<p>on solar panels and studies are focused on making them cheaper [2, 3].
</p>
<p>Optimal usage of photovoltaic (PV) panels for different cases is an important
</p>
<p>problem because the efficiency of the panels is changing as the weather changes. To
</p>
<p>solve this problem, panels are used in rural area or away from city centers where
</p>
<p>there are plenty of empty spaces letting get much more sunlight onto panel surface.
</p>
<p>But even in these conditions it is needed to maximize obtained solar energy by
</p>
<p>determining appropriate declination angle. That is why so many studies on decli-
</p>
<p>nation angle have been done [1, 2].
</p>
<p>Output power of any photovoltaic system depends on amount of obtained solar
</p>
<p>irradiance. To provide more sunlight as an input to system, it is required to track the
</p>
<p>sun. Main concern of these systems is first cost of system and cost of consumed

<p>energy during sun tracking. In this study, consumed energy of the system during
</p>
<p>sun tracking is minimized and it is compared with the other studies [11&ndash;15].
</p>
<p>Applications brought out different sun tracking systems [16&ndash;20].
</p>
<p>7.2 Maximizing Sunlight on Panels
</p>
<p>Easiest way to maximize sunlight in most system is to mount panels onto a hori-
</p>
<p>zontal tracking system. Sun takes highest place in sky according to horizontal axis
</p>
<p>at noon, so it is the time that sun has minimum distance in atmosphere and air has
</p>
<p>the minimum density during day. At other times, incident radiation flux becomes
</p>
<p>less since mass density is increasing and the angle between sunlight and normal of
</p>
<p>panel surface is increasing. Consequently, tracking at two axes is needed to increase
</p>
<p>the efficiency by decreasing this angle.
</p>
<p>In summer, even with a dry weather, approximately 12% more energy could be
</p>
<p>produced by using dynamic photovoltaic panels. During winter, 70% more energy
</p>
<p>and as an annual average 31% more energy could be produced. Figure 7.2 shows the
</p>
<p>comparison of stationary and dynamic photovoltaic panels at different months [2].
</p>
<p>To select the type of PV system (single axis or two axes) is a difficult decision as
</p>
<p>two-axis systems are much more expensive even though they are much more
</p>
<p>efficient. Slope will be changed during the year if it is decided to use one-axis
</p>
<p>tracking system. Inclination of panel changes depending one semester. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, inclination of the system used during summer is different than others (Fig. 7.2).

<p>7.3 Sun Tracking Systems
</p>
<p>Solar cells produce electrical energy using photon energy of sunlight. Output
</p>
<p>electrical energy is directly related with the amount of sunlight hitting onto the
</p>
<p>panel surface. Sunlight reaches earth with different angles during the day. So, to
</p>
<p>obtain maximum electrical energy by solar cells, PV systems should track the sun.
</p>
<p>This system aiming to maximize sunlight by tracking sun is called Sun Tracking
</p>
<p>System. Sun tracking systems are designed to track through West-East direction
</p>
<p>(one axis), West-East and North-South directions (two-axis) [3, 4]. Main aim of the
</p>
<p>all studies on photovoltaics is to decrease payback time of the system. It becomes
</p>
<p>possible only by increasing its efficiency. And efficiency could only be increased by
</p>
<p>increasing amount of solar radiation hitting on to the panel surface (Fig. 7.3).
</p>
<p>Amount of radiation hitting on to panel surface is related with cosine of the angle
</p>
<p>between the sunlight and the normal of the surface. It means that efficiency is
</p>
<p>maximized when sunlight goes through the normal of the panel surface. This sit-
</p>
<p>uation brings the need of a system to provide sunlight always normal to the panel
</p>
<p>surface by tracking the sun.
</p>
<p>Finsten has developed the first tracker in 1962. Later Saavedra has added an
</p>
<p>automatic control unit to this mechanical system in 1963. This unit inspired to build
</p>
<p>Eppley pyrheliometer. Maldonado designed and constructed a sun tracker system at
</p>
<p>Technical University Federico Santa Maria [5, 6].
</p>
<p>Main function of all tracking systems is to provide 1 or 2 degree of freedom to
</p>
<p>motion. In other words, main function is to supply sunlight at desired direction.
</p>
<p>There are many applications of single (one) axis tracking systems (SAT) as they
</p>
<p>provide power gain: Horizontal (HSAT), Vertical (VSAT), Tilted (TSAT) and Polar
</p>
<p>Aligned (PASAT). But studies on these systems are seen rarely in literature except
</p>
<p>one study which has concerned these systems. It is mentioned in this study that
</p>
<p>TSAT with 5 has collected 10% more radiation than HSAT where HSAT 15% more
</p>
<p>than VSAT. Also, it is found that PASAT collected 10% more than HSAT [3, 4].
</p>
<p>Sun tracking systems are classified considering number of degree of freedom,
</p>
<p>position of turning axis or the systematic for sun tracking.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.3.1 Classification Considering Number of Degree
</p>
<p>of Freedom
</p>
<p>One Axis Sun Tracking, Two Axis Sun Tracking.
</p>
<p>One axis sun tracking systems: One axis tracking systems performs movement in
</p>
<p>either azimuth or vertical axis (Fig. 7.4). Reason to prefer single axis tracking
</p>
<p>system is to have free area where it is mounted [11]. For example, parabolic trough
</p>
<p>systems tracks using azimuth and most of the roof application of photovoltaic
</p>
<p>systems track using only height angle due to limited space. SAT is direct and
</p>
<p>cheaper way to get better efficiency. By using a simpler system, efficiency is
</p>
<p>increased. RayTracker, a tracking system manufacturer, implied that they improved
</p>
<p>the performance 23 and 38% when compared respectively with fixed angle modules
</p>
<p>and outer flat modules.
</p>
<p>Two axis tracking systems: Two-axis tracking systems let movement in two axes
</p>
<p>(vertical and azimuth) which maximizes the efficiency of the tracking process.
</p>
<p>But SAT developers are questioning the efficiency as two axis tracking systems
</p>
<p>have additional installation, permitting and ongoing maintenance costs. Also higher
</p>
<p>defect risk related to having more moving parts compared to SATs is another
</p>
<p>concern. Moreover, two-axis systems need bigger spaces to place and consequently,
</p>
<p>to receive planning permits is much more difficult for them [3, 4].
</p>
<p>7.3.2 Classification Considering Position of Turning Axis
</p>
<p>Sun tracking systems are also classified considering joint axis. One axis tracking
</p>
<p>systems are classified as polar (Fig. 7.5), azimuth (Fig. 7.6) and horizontal
</p>
<p>(Fig. 7.7). On the other hand, two axis tracking systems are divided into two
</p>
<p>groups: azimuth and polar (Fig. 7.8).
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.4 One axis tracker

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Panel surface of polar one axis tracking systems is tilted through south direction
</p>
<p>and azimuth angle is tracked by turning around the axis goes through weight center
</p>
<p>of panel surface. While panel is tracking azimuth angle, it also tracks height angle
</p>
<p>in the meantime due to its geometry. Thus, polar one axis tracking systems have
</p>
<p>higher performance values when compared with other one axis tracking systems
</p>
<p>from energy production perspective. Azimuth one axis tracking systems (Fig. 7.6),
</p>
<p>turns on a structure with tilted panels around the axis normal to ground. This kind
</p>
<p>of one axis tracking systems are preferred when there are big areas for the panels.
</p>
<p>Horizontal one axis tracking systems turns on an axis parallel to ground
</p>
<p>(Fig. 7.7). This kind of tracking systems is generally used where height angle is
</p>
<p>approximately 90&deg; like equatorial region (0&deg;&ndash;&plusmn;30&deg;). Structure is compatible to
</p>
<p>move as groups. One motor could run many photovoltaic arrays at the same time.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, two axis systems are separated as polar and azimuth angles.
</p>
<p>Polar two axis systems only completes turning around its axis in a day. During the
</p>
<p>year it moves complying with sun movements and the issuing the commands comes
</p>
<p>from control system or sensor by the time.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, two axis azimuth moves both around its axis and along two
</p>
<p>axis during a day and so its control is much more complex (Fig. 7.8).

<p>Setup and maintenance costs of sun tracking systems are higher than the fixed
</p>
<p>systems having certain angle. Thus, this kind of systems needs being robust, less
</p>
<p>maintenance required and high capacity to redeem their costs in long term. Also,
</p>
<p>this kind of systems should be built at rural areas and at the places where sunlight
</p>
<p>will be present from sunrise to sunset as the performance of sun tracking systems
</p>
<p>will be lowered in city centers and in the places where intense building shadows
</p>
<p>occurred (Fig. 7.9). At these places, costs related with sun tracking system and its
</p>
<p>sensors will be decreased as sun tracking will be able to be accomplished from one
</p>
<p>center for whole system. Any battery will not be needed as the system will be on
</p>
<p>grid and its cost will be removed.
</p>
<p>7.3.3 Classification Considering Sun Tracking Systematic
</p>
<p>Generally control circuits consisting of electronic sensor systems, controller,
</p>
<p>microprocessor and GPS are used to position the system to where it is required to be.

<p>Passive sensor tracking: Some companies have tried to develop more energy
</p>
<p>efficient and cheaper tracking systems. For example, Portasol tracking systems&mdash;
</p>
<p>Australia&mdash;developed a hydraulic passive tracking system working according to
</p>
<p>thermal changes during the day to track the sun. Company states that electrical
</p>
<p>energy is not needed as tracking system does not include any electronic equipment,
</p>
<p>motor or gearbox. Figure 7.10 shows (a) panel stopped at night through west, at
</p>
<p>morning sun heats more the bottom part of tube and liquid expands through top,
</p>
<p>(b) panel turns until sun heats both tube equally, (c) panel tracks the sun with a
</p>
<p>certain angle by the time sun moves, (d) as a last step panel stopped at night through
</p>
<p>west [3, 4].
</p>
<p>First decision that should be taken is to choose whether passive or active
</p>
<p>tracking system will be used. While low boiling point of compressed gas is used to
</p>
<p>move in passive tracking systems, motor, gearbox or hydraulic components are
</p>
<p>used in active tracking systems and they consume energy. Passive systems using
</p>
<p>gas pressure produced by sun does not consume energy but they are more insuf-
</p>
<p>ficient to track the sun [3, 4].
</p>
<p>Active sensor tracking: Two photoresistances and photovoltaic cell are used as a
</p>
<p>sensor for one axis tracking systems. These sensors place next to each other. So,
</p>
<p>both sensors are at same conditions. Sensor are directly connected to motor, gen-
</p>
<p>erally direct current (DC) motors are used. The angle between panel surface and
</p>
<p>sunlight changes when sun moves. This leads to occur a difference between sensor
</p>
<p>outputs. Control circuit runs the motor and turns the system considering where
</p>
<p>more sunlight has come. Control circuit adjusts as panel surface is always normal to
</p>
<p>sunlight using this difference. The example by Poulek and Libra claimed their
</p>
<p>system was able to collect 95% of the energy with a &plusmn;5&deg; tolerance. Figure 7.11
</p>
<p>shows a sample structure [3, 4].
</p>
<p>Chronological tracking: Systematic of chronological tracking is based on deter-
</p>
<p>mining the movement positions before for every day during the year. Calculations
</p>
<p>are done for the related geographical region. System includes a pressor

<p>is calculated and system is turned as panel surface is normal to sunlight.
</p>
<p>Disadvantage of this system is that system continues to track and consume energy
</p>
<p>even during overcast sky.
</p>
<p>7.4 Application
</p>
<p>In this section, design and comparison of fixed and two axis photovoltaic panel
</p>
<p>system applications are given. Energy consumption is an important factor in two
</p>
<p>axis systems differing from one axis systems. It affects the system efficiency. To
</p>
<p>minimize this effect, literature is investigated and a low energy consumed DC motor
</p>
<p>having gearbox (Damper motor) is selected to use. Both used motors are identical.
</p>
<p>To be able to compare rightfully, both systems are used in same circumstances and
</p>
<p>panels having same trademark and model are used. Also, disturbing environmental
</p>
<p>factors (shadows, reflections etc.) are minimized as much as possible. Thus, a
</p>
<p>location where sunlight reached the panel all day during the whole year is chosen.
</p>
<p>7.4.1 Fixed Photovoltaic Panel Systems
</p>
<p>Widely used systems are fixed panel systems having low efficiency. Block scheme
</p>
<p>of fixed system is shown in Fig. 7.12 and picture of the used system is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.13. This system contains panel, measurement system, battery, inverter and
</p>
<p>load. Photovoltaic panel is placed as fixed considering geographical and meteo-
</p>
<p>rological data. Obtained power from panels are stored in batteries optimally.

<p>7.4.2 Two Axis Photovoltaic Panel System
</p>
<p>(Sun Tracking System)
</p>
<p>In this section, proposed two axis PV (sun tracking) system will be detailed.
</p>
<p>Consumed energy by the system has a higher priority in designing dynamic systems
</p>
<p>as it is related with the system performance. To minimize the consumed energy,
</p>
<p>literature is investigated and a new motor type (DC motor with gear unit) is found
</p>
<p>as a solution. Figure 7.14 shows the application of proposed system.
</p>
<p>This dynamic system moves in two axes. East-West direction is defined as
</p>
<p>horizontal axis and North-South direction is defined as vertical axis. System is able
</p>
<p>to move in both axes at the same time as shown in Figs. 7.14 and 7.15. Two roller
</p>
<p>bearings are used as supports in the system. Wind load data of the last 10 years for

<p>the application area is acquired from meteorology are so low that no need to be
</p>
<p>taken into account in design stage eventhough system is capable of resisting the
</p>
<p>loads over average [1].
</p>
<p>Designed system consists of 2 Damper Motor (DM), 4 gel batteries (12 V&ndash;
</p>
<p>100 Ah), 2 PV panel (120 W), power inverter, solar battery charger, Maximum
</p>
<p>Power Point Tracker (MPPT), data acquisition card, Light-Dependent Resistors
</p>
<p>(LDR)s and mechanical system (Fig. 7.16).
</p>
<p>Required energy to track the sun is provided from batteries. System tracks sun
</p>
<p>continuously at vertical and horizontal axis in sunny weather conditions. System is
</p>
<p>stopped by a LDR in cloudy weather conditions and at nights. Produced energy just
</p>
<p>after sun rise is enough to start the motor even if all energy in batteries is consumed.
</p>
<p>Because total need power for panels is 240 W while it is only 12 W for motors.
</p>
<p>Two axes photovoltaic system contains solar panel moving through North-South
</p>
<p>and East-West directions. Solar panel is moved by the help of motor tracking sun by
</p>
<p>photoresistances (LDRs) and control system. So, it is profited from sun efficiently.
</p>
<p>Efficiency of photovoltaic panel is maximized when sunlight comes normal to panel
</p>
<p>surface. For this reason, control circuits need to command motor at certain points to
</p>
<p>provide panel angle as 90&deg; to sunlight. This task is accomplished by control circuit
</p>
<p>by the help of photoresistances. Control system has electronic and electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical components. Suns movement is determined by 5 LDRs in control circuit to
</p>
<p>provide being normal to surface (Fig. 7.17). Also, time delay relays arranged with
</p>
<p>3 s time difference are used to prevent PCBs work at the same time. 2 LDRs are
</p>
<p>used to measure movement in horizontal axis (East-West). 2 LDRs are used to
</p>
<p>measure movement in vertical axis (North-South) and one is to know whether being

</p>
<p>motors are able to move panel to provide being normal to surface [1]. To determine
</p>
<p>the position of sun, several variables (irradiance, declination angle, azimuth angle,
</p>
<p>zenith angle etc.) should be defined or calculated. Control unit calculates these

<p>7.4.3 Mathematical Modeling of Two Axis Photovoltaic
</p>
<p>System
</p>
<p>This system tracks in two axis. Even horizontal (East-west) and vertical
</p>
<p>(North-south) axis seems together, they are moving independently. System freely
</p>
<p>moves in horizontal and vertical as shown in Fig. 7.19. Two roller bearings ease
</p>
<p>movement in both axes. Wind load is omitted as it is seen low in Diyarbakır&rsquo;s last
10 year data (&lt;3.5 m/s). But system is designed for overloads. Mathematical
</p>
<p>modelling of system for horizontal and vertical axis is done as seen below [2, 10].
</p>
<p>In modeling the system, Eqs. (7.1)&ndash;(7.5) (derived for system shown in Fig. 7.20)
</p>
<p>are used for horizontal (East-West) and vertical (North-South) axis [2, 10].

<p>It is not needed to derive the equations for horizontal axis because both axes have
</p>
<p>same situation [2&ndash;10].
</p>
<p>7.5 Modeling of Sun Tracking
</p>
<p>As same principles are valid for both axes, modelling for one axis will be enough in
</p>
<p>designing system. Working principle of system is shown in Fig. 7.21. Four LDRs
</p>
<p>helped to direct panel into the right direction by giving correct angle (between
</p>
<p>normal and coming sunlight). Location of LDRs are adjusted as every LDR has the
</p>
<p>same amount of sunlight when sunlight comes as normal to panel surface. The
</p>
<p>current produced by LDRs are amplified by an operational amplifier and measured
</p>
<p>change in current is accepted as error which shows that sunlight doesn&rsquo;t come to
</p>
<p>surface normal. Then control unit drives the motor to turn the system into position
</p>
<p>here error value becomes zero.
</p>
<p>Coordinate System: Center of coordinate system is assumed to be on output gear.
</p>
<p>When reference axis is accepted as the stationary body of DC motor, all rotations
</p>
<p>are measured around this axis. Sun axis (line connecting center of output gear with
</p>
<p>sun) states hr(t) reference angle (Fig. 7.22). Purpose of control system is to mini-
</p>
<p>mize the angle difference, a(t), between Bvt and h0(t) where h0(t) represents the
</p>
<p>angle between reference axis and tracking axis [10].

<p>Error Detector: When tracking axis overlaps with sun axis: a(t) = 0 and
</p>
<p>ia(t) = ib(t) = I or ia(t) &ndash; ib(t) = 0. As shown in Fig. 7.21, sunlight having W width
</p>
<p>reaches at certain a angle to A cell with oa width and to B cell with ob width [10].

a(t) � (C &minus; W/2)L. When (C &minus; W/2)L � tan a(t) � (C + W/2)L, ia(t) current
goes through zero from 2I. When tan a(t) � (C + W/2)L, ia(t) &minus; ib(t) = 0.
Nonlinear characteristic shown in Fig. 7.23 can be used to define error detector. As
</p>
<p>a(t) angle is very small, a(t) is used instead of tan a(t) [10].

<p>Damper Motor: The systems using solar panels produce DC power and it is
</p>
<p>preferred to use DC motors and devices working with DC power in the system. As a
</p>
<p>matter of fact that an inverter will be needed for alternative current (AC) systems
</p>
<p>and both cost of inverter and losses of inverter will decrease the efficiency of
</p>
<p>system.
</p>
<p>Damper motors are the AC motor types which can easily control under varying
</p>
<p>loads. Easiness to control and to start running at desired speed makes DC motors
</p>
<p>preferred in tracking systems. Moment could be changed by changing armature
</p>
<p>current and speed could be changed by changing voltage in motors by the help of
</p>
<p>electronic circuits. The motor used in the system is a brushed permanent magnet
</p>
<p>DC motor. DM consists of DC motor and a coupled gear unit (having 15 gears).
</p>
<p>Moment of DM is increased by the help of gearbox (16 Nm). For both axes, same
</p>
<p>motor is used. Movements through North-South and East-West of panels in the
</p>
<p>system are performed slowly considering movement of sun. Selected DC motor
</p>
<p>with a gear unit is shown in Fig. 7.24 and its specifications are given in Table 7.1
</p>
<p>[1, 2].
</p>
<p>Damper motor consists of two components. First is gear unit and second is DC
</p>
<p>motor. Angular position h0 of output gear is related with angular position of motor
</p>

<p>Diyarbakır is chosen as the location where the area of highest solar radiation potential
in Turkey is and experiments are run on the roof of Engineering Faculty of Dicle

<p>under different weather conditions during the year [2]. To be able to compare the
</p>
<p>designed tracking system with the fixed system placed at the same location, panels
</p>
<p>having same trademark and model are used under same conditions. Comparison is
</p>
<p>done for the whole year data. Also, measurements are compared with the meteoro-
</p>
<p>logical data. These data belong to the interval between 01.01.2012 and 30.12.2012.
</p>
<p>Measurements are done at each 10 min daily. Then, hourly and daily data are cal-
</p>
<p>culated using minute measurement data and also monthly and annual data are derived
</p>
<p>from daily data. Obtained data are shown in Figs. 7.26 and 7.27.
</p>
<p>Energy consumption of two-axis sun tracking system is seen as low as not to
</p>
<p>take into consideration to calculate. As seen in Fig. 7.28, the permanent magnet DC
</p>
<p>motor of 12 W has a small structure and total consumed power during a day doesn&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>exceed 3 Wh. As sun tracking system stop at west position at sunset, at sunrise
</p>
<p>system turns to east for 3 min and most of the energy consumption occurs at this
</p>
<p>stage (0.6 Wh) as shown in Fig. 7.28. Then, until sunset energy is consumed at
</p>
<p>small values (as an average 0.1 Wh) according to movement of sun at horizontal
</p>
<p>and vertical axis.

<p>Disadvantage of sun tracking systems is its cost and consumed energy during
</p>
<p>tracking. Damper motor, used firstly in this system, has decreased both cost and
</p>
<p>also the consumed energy during tracking. Power of used motor is equal to 12 W.
</p>
<p>Daily power consumption even for the longest day (21 June) didn&rsquo;t exceed 3 Wh.
</p>
<p>DC motor is generally used in sun tracking system. Asynchronous motor is also
</p>
<p>used in several studies [1&ndash;3]. Obtained power is converted to AC by the help of an
</p>
<p>inverter in these studies. In this case, inverter losses decrease energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>Comparison with previous studies has shown that the system using damper motor
</p>
<p>consumed less energy as shown in Fig. 7.29 [1&ndash;4]. There are two reasons that
</p>
<p>damper motor consumes less energy. First reason is to have less power (12 W) and
</p>
<p>second reason is to have many gears (15 gears). To use these motors is recom-
</p>
<p>mended in tracking systems as sun moves slowly.

<p>7.7 Conclusions
</p>
<p>Energy production from sun by using panels is related with their cost and efficiency.
</p>
<p>Having high cost (1 W = 1$) and low efficiency (10&ndash;25%) of panels led to develop
</p>
<p>sun tracking systems. The feasible way to reduce the cost and produce more energy
</p>
<p>in a unit panel area is to use sun tracking systems. Even setup cost is higher than
</p>
<p>fixed systems; they are more advantageous when produced energy and occupied
</p>
<p>area is considered. Today it is inevitable to use these systems.
</p>
<p>Efficiency of photovoltaic systems used to produce electrical energy directly
</p>
<p>from sun energy is still low. Most difficult task for sun tracking system which is one
</p>
<p>of the methods applied to increase efficiency is to minimize the consumed energy
</p>
<p>and cost. Panel cost is much higher than design and consume energy costs of
</p>
<p>tracking system. Also, need surface area will be low as power obtained from a unit
</p>
<p>panel area is higher [2, 17].
</p>
<p>Disadvantages of the sun tracking systems are setup cost and the consumed
</p>
<p>energy during tracking. Using damper motor, contrary to general application, in
</p>
<p>designed system and having more basic control circuit made possible to decrease
</p>
<p>both cost and consumed energy during tracking. In the mentioned study 12 W
</p>
<p>damper motor is used and daily consumed power is not reaching even 3 W/h during
</p>
<p>the longest day (21 June). Design of control circuit is critical as it provides tracking
</p>
<p>at both horizontal (West-East) and vertical (North-South) direction during the day.
</p>
<p>Developed circuit stops the system at cloudy weather and night and so it helps
</p>
<p>saving energy.
</p>
<p>Obtained data showed that efficiency of newly designed two axis sun tracking
</p>
<p>system is 70% higher during winter, 11% higher during summer and 31.67% higher
</p>
<p>as an average during the year when compared with fixed system. Figure 7.2 shows
</p>
<p>that fixed system is also producing high power during summer where sun is gen-
</p>
<p>erous even two axis system is given better results. So, power difference is becoming
</p>
<p>low during summer. But this difference changes during winter and efficiency of two
</p>
<p>axis system becomes higher.
</p>
<p>Another important factor for tracking system is how much cheaper and light
</p>
<p>mechanical components are built. This factor affects directly payback time. New
</p>
<p>studies on minimizing its effect will make tracking system cheaper and advanta-
</p>
<p>geous and sun as a clean and renewable energy resource will continue to heat and
</p>
<p>give energy to next generations.

</p>
<p>Abstract The solar energy have become a challenging area among other renewable
</p>
<p>energy sources (RESs) since the photovoltaic (PV) systems have the advantages of
</p>
<p>not causing pollution, having low maintenance, and long-lasting operation life.
</p>
<p>Besides these advantages, a PV system has several drawbacks such as considerably
</p>
<p>higher installation cost comparing some other RESs, and limited efficiency ranges
</p>
<p>between 9&ndash;18%. The feasibility analyses have a great role in order to determine the
</p>
<p>most appropriate plant site before installation. On the other hand, the operating
</p>
<p>analyses and improvements based on maximum power point tracking (MPPT) are
</p>
<p>quite important to increase the harvested total energy. The intermittent characteristic
</p>
<p>and perturbing power curve of a PV module is one of the most important defects that
</p>
<p>should be tackled to increase the generation efficiency. The power-voltage (P-V) and
</p>
<p>current-voltage (I-V) curves are main efficiency indicators of a PV system that
</p>
<p>exhibit nonlinear characteristics in its natural structure. Furthermore, the generated
</p>
<p>maximum power with a PV panel depends on two main quantities of temperature
</p>
<p>and irradiation. However, it is possible to increase the generated power up to
</p>
<p>maximum rates by MPPT algorithms. This chapter introduces most widely used
</p>
<p>algorithms respecting to their implementation and utilization properties. The indi-
</p>
<p>rect, direct, and computational methods are presented considering their advantages
</p>
<p>and disadvantages. The conventional and novel algorithms are explained with
</p>
<p>flowcharts and analytical details in order to provide clear comparison. The artificial
</p>
<p>methods are expressed in the last section where fuzzy logic, artificial intelligence,
</p>
<p>and optimization-based approaches are discussed.

<p>8.1 Chapter Overview
</p>
<p>The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is an algorithm that is associated with
</p>
<p>dc-dc power converters and inverters to track maximum power point during energy
</p>
<p>conversion process. Thus, the generated energy is maximized in this way. Although
</p>
<p>there are several methods proposed to implement an MPPT system, there are two
</p>
<p>algorithms known as &ldquo;perturb and observe&rdquo; (P&amp;O) and the &ldquo;incremental conduc-
</p>
<p>tance&rdquo; (IncCond methods are widely used since they are commercially preferred.
</p>
<p>However, simpler algorithms lack to provide the anticipated performance on the
</p>
<p>output power. The recent researches on MPPT algorithms exhibited that more
</p>
<p>sophisticated algorithms yield better outputs comparing to widely known basic
</p>
<p>methods. Therefore, a wide variety of numerical methods including fuzzy logic,
</p>
<p>neural networks and other computational methods are proposed. Although these
</p>
<p>recent algorithms require increased complexity, they easily compete with malfunc-
</p>
<p>tions of previous methods in terms of partial shading, misdirection during tracking,
</p>
<p>power fluctuations around MPP, and inadequate performance at low irradiance.

<p>In this chapter, the MPPT algorithms have been analyzed in there groups where the
</p>
<p>first group includes indirect algorithms while others are described as direct algo-
</p>
<p>rithms, and numerical algorithms. The groups have been allocated considering the
</p>
<p>progress on methods and approaches where the indirect and direct algorithms are
</p>
<p>known as conventional MPPT techniques. The most recent computational algorithms
</p>
<p>including genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, and
</p>
<p>artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC) are the hottest topics in MPPT algorithms.
</p>
<p>The trade-off between conventional MPPTmethods and recent algorithms are related
</p>
<p>to complexity in algorithm and to cost in application.
</p>
<p>This chapter is dedicated to these widely used MPPT algorithms of PV systems.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the initial sections introduce analytical background of a PVpanel at a glance,
</p>
<p>and power curves of any PV panel in brief. Afterwards, the power conversion system of
</p>
<p>a PV plant with power converters is described to emphasize the application of a generic
</p>
<p>MPPTblock in power conversion issues in the following section. TheMPPTalgorithms
</p>
<p>have been presented in three sections including indirect algorithms, direct algorithms,
</p>
<p>and numerical algorithms with their application examples.
</p>
<p>8.2 Basic Principles of Photovoltaic Energy Conversion
</p>
<p>Edmund Becquerel, a French physicist, firstly discovered the photovoltaic (PV)
</p>
<p>energy by generating electricity when he illuminated an electrode in electrolyte
</p>
<p>solution in 1839. However, Adams and Day made the first practical application of
</p>
<p>PV by applying the PV energy to solid materials about 40 years later. The primary
</p>
<p>PV cells made of selenium were performing almost 1 or 2% efficiency. Probably
</p>
<p>Einstein was the most important contributor of PV by explaining theoretical PV
</p>
<p>effect in 1904 that brought a Nobel Prize to him in 1923. The first generation silicon
</p>
<p>PV cells were produced by 1940s and 1950s by Czochralski, a Polish scientist. The
</p>
<p>solar panels constituted with numerous PV cells were commercially available in
</p>
<p>1963 when Sharp Corporation succeeded in producing practical silicon photovoltaic
</p>
<p>modules. Although there were several applications of solar cells seen in Vanguard I
</p>
<p>space satellite in 1958, Explorer III, Vanguard II, and Sputnik-3 in 1959. World&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>first largest PV array was built in Japan with 242 Wp rated power in 1963 [1&ndash;4].
</p>
<p>A PV energy conversion system is composed of a PV module, a dc-dc converter,
</p>
<p>an inverter, and preferably an energy storage system (ESS). The PV module is
</p>
<p>constituted by PV cells that are series and parallel connected to generate the desired
</p>
<p>rated power. The cells are produced in monocrystalline or polycrystalline structure
</p>
<p>depending to the purity of semiconductor [5&ndash;7]. The polycrystalline cells that
</p>
<p>provide limited efficiency around 13&ndash;14% are less efficient comparing to the
</p>
<p>monocrystalline that the efficiency increases up to 20%.
</p>
<p>The analytical model of a PV cell is designed referring to one-diode electrical
</p>
<p>equivalent as shown in Fig. 8.1. This circuit includes a photocurrent source, a
</p>
<p>diode, and serial and shunt resistors that are known as one-diode or five-parameter
</p>
<p>model [8]. The calculations of the one-diode model seen in Fig. 8.1 are depended to
</p>
<p>the output current;

<p>where (V) depicts the dependency of diode and resistor currents to terminal voltage
</p>
<p>while they are independent from irradiation value.
</p>

<p>where ID is current and VD is voltage of the diode, IR is reverse blocking current, VD
is thermal voltage, and η is the ideality factor of the diode [9, 10]. The current of

<p>There are several other equivalent circuit models presented in the literature to
</p>
<p>increase the reliability of the PV cell design. The implementation structure of the
</p>
<p>cell is expressed by additional electrical elements in the improved models. One of
</p>
<p>these models that is being extensively studied one, amorphous silicon PV cell is
</p>
<p>illustrated in Fig. 8.2. The polymer and amorphous silicon based PV cell is con-
</p>
<p>stituted with an additional dependent current source controlled by photocurrent and
</p>
<p>terminal voltage.

<p>This equivalent circuit is obtained by modifying the well-known five-parameter

<p>8.3 Power Conversion and MPPT
</p>
<p>The solar power generation systems have attracted extensive attention in several
</p>
<p>application areas such as agricultural, residential, and even industrial sites.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sensations related to greenhouse emissions and carbon footprints
</p>
<p>are key factors to promote the utilization of solar power systems. Nowadays, the
</p>
<p>installation costs are decreased and overall efficiency of a PV system is increased

<p>comparing to a few decades ago. The decreased costs allow redeeming earlier by
</p>
<p>ranging five years to seven years that accelerate the usage of solar energy in
</p>
<p>distribution systems. The solar power generation systems are constructed in two
</p>
<p>types; either standalone or grid-tied [14&ndash;17].
</p>
<p>The standalone systems are attractive for remote sites where the distribution lines
</p>
<p>are unavailable. The standalone plants are composed of solar arrays, dc-dc converter,
</p>
<p>ESS, and inverter. On the other hand, the grid-tied systems eliminates ESS
</p>
<p>requirement and requires a grid-tie inverter instead of classical inverters. The
</p>
<p>complete block diagram of a solar power generation system with grid-connection is
</p>
<p>depicted in Fig. 8.5. The solar array is a combination of PV modules in series and
</p>
<p>parallel to generate the required power in various voltage and current ratings. The
</p>
<p>power conversion stage consists of dc power interface and its ac conversion pairs.
</p>
<p>The dc-dc converters are used to stabilize the intermittent characteristic of solar array
</p>
<p>that is considerably depended to solar irradiation and ambient temperature. The
</p>
<p>power conversion structure can be in single-stage or double-stage interface where
</p>
<p>the single-stage includes just a dc-ac inverter while the double-stage is composed of
</p>
<p>dc-dc converter and dc-ac inverter as seen in Fig. 8.5. The single-stage interface
</p>
<p>lacks in the stabilizing the dc bus voltage against rapidly varying dc output of solar
</p>
<p>array. However, the inverter requires operating an algorithm to track the maximum
</p>
<p>power point in order to match dc bus voltage of solar array.
</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to sustain optimum matching at all radiation levels
</p>
<p>since the maximum power point rapidly fluctuates depending to the radiation and
</p>
<p>temperature. This operation can be performed in large-scale solar plants where the
</p>
<p>generated dc bus voltage excesses the required supply voltage of inverter. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the most proper way is to use double-stage power interface in any case [4, 16, 18&ndash;20].
</p>
<p>A dc-dc converter is connected between solar array and inverter to match the
</p>
<p>required dc bus voltage in the double-stage power conversion system. The dc-dc
</p>
<p>converter handles the MPPT operation and the dc bus voltage is matched at this first
</p>
<p>stage. The MPPT algorithm of converter increases or decreases the dc bus voltage
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.5 The detailed block diagram of a solar power generation system

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>according to varied climatic conditions and maintains the match between dc supply
</p>
<p>limits of inverter. The MPPT algorithm controls the duty cycle of dc-dc converter
</p>
<p>where it changes the converted dc voltage level by adjusting the operation period of
</p>
<p>semiconductor switch in the topology. Thus, the maximum power is extracted from
</p>
<p>solar array by appropriately matching I-V balance of solar modules. The widely
</p>
<p>used dc-dc converter topologies are Buck-Boost and Cuk besides classical buck or
</p>
<p>boost topologies in solar power generation systems. It is not placed in this section
</p>
<p>since the converter topologies can be found in several textbooks [4, 20, 21].
</p>
<p>The second interface used in double-stage is inverter that converts the dc bus
</p>
<p>voltage to ac power where the converted ac power is either supplied to the stan-
</p>
<p>dalone loads or is injected to the utility grid. The inverter topology to be used in this
</p>
<p>interface depends to the power level where two-level or multilevel topologies can
</p>
<p>be selected. The multilevel topologies that were firstly introduced by Nabae gen-
</p>
<p>erate the third voltage level with the neutral point of dc bus. The most widely used
</p>
<p>multilevel inverter (MLI) topologies are diode clamped, flying capacitor, and cas-
</p>
<p>caded H-bridge in renewable energy. The diode clamped and cascaded H-bridge
</p>
<p>topologies provide the most proper involvement in high power applications where
</p>
<p>megavolt-ampere MVA power handling is desired. The flying capacitor arrange-
</p>
<p>ment eliminates filtering requirement comparing to diode clamped topology.
</p>
<p>However, this circuit is not accepted as robust as cascaded H-bridge to obviate the
</p>
<p>harmonic contents and the cost issues. Furthermore, several other MLI topologies
</p>
<p>such as grid-tied or string structures are implemented depending to the power
</p>
<p>ratings in solar energy application [4, 20].
</p>
<p>The efficiency of a power conversion system is related to several factors such as
</p>
<p>conduction losses, switching losses, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and total
</p>
<p>harmonic distortion (THD) rates. The power efficiency is primarily decreased by
</p>
<p>power loss that are caused by active devices while the EMI and THD losses induce
</p>
<p>to defects on power quality and efficiency. The power losses increase proportionally
</p>
<p>to the switched voltage and current rates. The MLI topologies decrease the switched
</p>
<p>voltage and current rates at each cycle owing to its staircase output waveforms.
</p>
<p>Consequently, the power losses are also decreased comparing to regular two-level
</p>
<p>inverter topologies. The harmonic contents, THD ratios, and EMI rates are reduced
</p>
<p>by this way. The MLI output waveforms, either voltage or current depending to the
</p>
<p>topology, are increased to several levels, are particularly presented in odd numbers
</p>
<p>such as 3-level, 5-level, 7-level etc. In addition to these, the asymmetrical MLI
</p>
<p>topologies allow generating more increased output voltage levels by using same
</p>
<p>power stages as cascaded topologies [4, 19&ndash;21].
</p>
<p>The rated power of a solar power generation system is increased by several string
</p>
<p>connections of power modules where the series-connected PV modules comprise
</p>
<p>the strings. Furthermore, several strings can be connected in parallel to achieve
</p>
<p>higher power ranges. The grid connection of PV plants that are constructed by using
</p>
<p>such strings is performed with various converter infrastructures. The most widely
</p>
<p>used power conversion schemes are illustrated in Fig. 8.6 where the connection
</p>
<p>diagrams of central converter, multi-string converter, string converter, and
</p>
<p>micro-converter are exhibited from Fig. 8.6a&ndash;d, respectively. Central converters are

<p>constituted of inverters that convert the dc voltage achieved from PV strings ac
</p>
<p>voltage. They are widely used in residential, commercial, and utility scale systems
</p>
<p>with a power level of 1 kW or higher. The MPPT operation of the PV panels is
</p>
<p>performed centrally at the dc-ac inverter stage as shown in Fig. 8.6a. The main

<p>advantages of this scheme are decreased cost of inverter and decreased switching
</p>
<p>losses owing to unique converter structure. However, the central converter usage
</p>
<p>causes to a main drawback in acquired energy level since it is controlled by a single
</p>
<p>MPPT where the individual MPPT support is not available for each PV strings.
</p>
<p>Thus, the acquired maximum power level is limited under shading, thermal vari-
</p>
<p>ations, aging or disorientation of PV strings. The multi-string converter seen in
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.6b is comprised of several individual dc-dc converters usually managing two

<p>PV strings or three PV strings at most. In this case, the double-stage interface is
</p>
<p>compulsory. The most important contribution of the double-stage interface is
</p>
<p>additional dc-dc converters that allow increasing the dc input voltage in a wide
</p>
<p>range. The PV plant can be freely constructed by arranging several dc-dc converter
</p>
<p>connections of strings. The dc-ac conversion is configured by using a central
</p>
<p>inverter that eliminates the drawbacks of the previous converter structure since the
</p>
<p>MPPT operations are handled by dc-dc converters.
</p>
<p>The string converter that is shown in Fig. 8.6c is configured with individual
</p>
<p>MPPT controllers that do not allow parallel connection of strings. This option
</p>
<p>provides to locate each PV string in any direction or orientation. Furthermore, it is
</p>
<p>freely possible to care shading conditions and to determine PV module number in a
</p>
<p>string. The prominent feature of string converter is relevant to its power level that is
</p>
<p>widely designed at low power levels to be used in single-phase applications. In
</p>
<p>addition to this, its common topology includes full-bridge inverter with lien fre-
</p>
<p>quency transformer at the output stage. Thus, this configuration causes to a drawback
</p>
<p>of higher cost per kW. The micro-inverter is constituted with a dc-ac converter for
</p>
<p>each PV module where individual MPPT and power conversion features are
</p>
<p>acquired by this way. The configuration seen in Fig. 8.6d enables each PV module to
</p>
<p>connect to the ac grid without any dc wiring. Although this configuration provides
</p>
<p>simpler usage and installation, the cost per kW is higher than string converters.
</p>
<p>Also, the operation cycle of the converter is lower than of a PV module [20, 21].
</p>
<p>Although the utilization of PV systems are increased day by day, two main draw-
</p>
<p>backs are being extensively studied to overcome which are high installation costs,
</p>
<p>and low conversion efficiency. The acquired output power of a PV system is
</p>
<p>increased by using several mathematical algorithms. The MPPT is a fundamental
</p>
<p>method that eliminates the mismatch along the load characteristic and maximum
</p>
<p>power output of a PV module. MPPT algorithms ensure the optimal usage of PV
</p>
<p>modules against several defective conditions such as disorientation, shading or
</p>
<p>partial shading. Furthermore, the intermittent characteristic of solar power is sus-
</p>
<p>tained in a reliable way by using MPPT methods. Many MPPT methods have been
</p>
<p>proposed for single-stage and double-stage systems to cope with performance lim-
</p>
<p>itations. The most prominent classifications of MPPT methods are indirect and direct
</p>
<p>methods. The indirect methods include several algorithms such as open-circuit,
</p>
<p>constant voltage, short-circuit, and pulse method where some of them requires
</p>
<p>former knowledge on the PV array characteristics while some requires mathematical
</p>
<p>calculations. These requirements limit the efficiency of the algorithm at any case of
</p>
<p>irradiance and temperature variations.
</p>
<p>The alternative MPPTmethods are classified under direct methods where the most
</p>
<p>widely known ones are perturb and observe (P&amp;O), hill climbing (HC), and incre-
</p>
<p>mental conductance (IncCon). These methods are competitor to indirect methods in
</p>
<p>terms of simplicity, easy implementation with limited prior information, and effi-
</p>
<p>ciency The commercial applications of MPPT methods are performed with P&amp;O
</p>
<p>algorithm where the algorithm instantly measures voltage value at the maximum
</p>
<p>power point and tracks the variation. The MPPT algorithm is used to determine the
</p>
<p>switching angle of power converters depicted in Fig. 8.6. The algorithm detects and
</p>
<p>8 Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Algorithms &hellip; 215</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>tracks the reference voltage to change the duty cycle, and consequently the output
</p>
<p>voltage of converter [4, 22&ndash;25]. The most recent improvement of MPPT algorithms
</p>
<p>are performed by using intelligence based methods such as fuzzy logic controllers
</p>
<p>(FLCs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), particle swarm optimization (PSO)
</p>
<p>algorithms, and several genetic algorithm (GA)methods [23, 26]. The soft computing
</p>
<p>methods provide better efficiency and faster response comparing to indirect and
</p>
<p>direct methods. However, they lack on simplicity. The MPPT methods and out-
</p>
<p>standing properties are presented in the following sections.
</p>
<p>8.4 Indirect MPPT Algorithms
</p>
<p>The indirect MPPT algorithms differ from direct MPPT methods by calculations to
</p>
<p>determine the PV cell voltage and current at MPP. However, the direct MPPT
</p>
<p>methods are based on measurements instead of calculations. The indirect algorithms
</p>
<p>are based on several calculation methods including system voltage adjustment,
</p>
<p>temperature measurement, open-circuit voltage VOC calculation, and azimuth and
</p>
<p>angle calculation sometimes. The system voltage or operating voltage adjustment is
</p>
<p>performed to detect the MPP voltage according to seasonal variations where it
</p>
<p>should be higher in winters. The operating voltage depends on the PV module
</p>
<p>temperature. The MPP voltage is calculated regarding to VOC that is instantly
</p>
<p>measured. The main advantage of indirect MPPT methods including constant
</p>
<p>voltage, open-circuit voltage, and short-current pulse-based is their simplicity.
</p>
<p>However, they lack against aging and pollution of PV cells [26&ndash;29].
</p>
<p>8.4.1 Constant Voltage MPPT Method
</p>
<p>The constant voltage (CV) method is the plainest MPPT algorithm that is based on
</p>
<p>regulating the array voltage to track the MPP voltage VMPP as seen in Table 8.1.
</p>
<p>The PV array voltage is adjusted around VMPP regarding to the reference voltage
</p>
<p>VRef that is the regulated array voltage. It is intended to match the VRef to VMPP in
</p>
<p>the most proper adjustment. If this is not the case, then the algorithm tries to acquire
</p>
<p>the most adequate adjustment around the VMPP. The CV algorithm assumes that the
</p>
<p>irradiance and temperature variations on the cells do not cause to meaningful
</p>
<p>changes on VMPP and therefore, the VRef can be kept constant during the operation
</p>
<p>of algorithm. The flowchart of the CV MPPT operation is illustrated in Fig. 8.7
</p>
<p>where the PV array voltage is required to be measured at the beginning of the
</p>
<p>algorithm. The algorithm does not involve any other input data. The measured array
</p>
<p>voltage VPV is used to set up the duty-cycle of dc-dc converter. Then the duty cycle
</p>
<p>is updated at each turn by comparing the array voltage to reference voltage [26, 28].
</p>
<p>When the array voltage is greater than reference, the duty cycle is decreased in the
</p>
<p>next step or vice versa.
</p>
<p>216 E. Kabalci</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It should be noted that CV method is more efficient comparing to regular P&amp;O
</p>
<p>technique during the lower irradiance conditions. Therefore, it may be integrated
</p>
<p>other MPPT methods.
</p>
<p>8.4.2 Open Voltage MPPT Method
</p>
<p>The open voltage (OV) method is based on the assumption of that VMPP is ever
</p>
<p>around a fixed percentage of the open-circuit voltage VOV. It is also assumed that
</p>
<p>the production variations of cells, temperature, and solar irradiance rates change the
</p>
<p>MPP around 2% of its regular value. Therefore, this method defines a reference
</p>
<p>voltage VRef at the 76% of VOV, which is quite near to VMPP.
</p>
<p>The flowchart of OV method is depicted in Fig. 8.8 where open-circuit voltage
</p>
<p>VOV measurement is required to determine the reference voltage. This measurement
</p>
<p>is performed by opening the circuit, and a series static switch is used to carry out
</p>
<p>this action. This operation causes to zero PV current that prevents the power
</p>
<p>generation at this stage. In the next step, the measured PV voltage VPV is compared
</p>
<p>to the reference voltage VRef to determine the exact duty-cycle of dc-dc converter.
</p>
<p>The pre-defined duty-cycle Dn is increased in the next step, if VRef is greater than
</p>
<p>VPV [26, 28, 30, 31].
</p>

</p>
<p>constant voltage MPPT

<p>method
</p>
<p>8 Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Algorithms &hellip; 217</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If the VPV is greater than VRef then the Dn is decreased by varied value for the
</p>
<p>next duty-cycle calculation Dn+1. The regulated dc output voltage is controlled by
</p>
<p>PI block at each cycle to track the VMPP.
</p>
<p>8.4.3 Short-Current Pulse-Based MPPT Method
</p>
<p>The short-current pulse-based (SCPB) MPPT method determines VRef that is
</p>
<p>required to generate the optimum operating current IOP. In the ideal conditions, IOP
is proportional to the short-circuit current ISC by a coefficient k and irradiance level
</p>
<p>of S as seen in Eq. (8.12);
</p>
<p>IOP&eth;S&THORN; &frac14; k � ISC&eth;S&THORN; &eth;8:12&THORN;
</p>
<p>The equation exhibits that the operating current is defined by irradiance level and
</p>
<p>ISC where it is also temperature dependent that varies between 0 and 60 &deg;C. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, the coefficient is assumed to be around 92%. It is obvious that this
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.8 Flowchart of the open-voltage MPPT method
</p>
<p>218 E. Kabalci</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>algorithm is based on short-circuit current measurement and that is performed by a
</p>
<p>parallel static switch similar to previous method. The parallel switch provides the
</p>
<p>short circuit conditions where the array voltage is zero and power generation is
</p>
<p>prevented. The flowchart of this control method is shown in Fig. 8.9 that the
</p>
<p>preliminary measurements and comparisons are depicted similar to OV MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithm with a difference where the measured and compared parameters are
</p>
<p>current in this method [27, 28, 30, 31].
</p>
<p>The PI regulator requires the array voltage as in the OV method to generate the
</p>
<p>operating current where the reference voltage is also acquired at this stage.
</p>
<p>8.5 Direct MPPT Algorithms
</p>
<p>The direct MPPT algorithms are based on measurement of PV module voltage,
</p>
<p>current, or instant power where the performance variations are rapidly detected and
</p>
<p>more accurate tracking is performed. The basic principles of direct MPPT
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.9 Flowchart of the short-current pulse-based MPPT method
</p>
<p>8 Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Algorithms &hellip; 219</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>algorithms are related to periodic tuning of I-V and P-V curves, and adjusting the
</p>
<p>operating voltage in small steps to increase the accuracy. The first principle is used
</p>
<p>to determine the maximum output power of PV module that is tracked at each turn
</p>
<p>of duty-cycle calculation of the dc-dc converter. The second principle is performed
</p>
<p>by a method known as hill climbing that is based on detecting the power or current
</p>
<p>direction either increasing or decreasing. In case the measured value increased
</p>
<p>depending on the operating voltage, the tracking direction is set to forward,
</p>
<p>otherwise it is set to backward. The MPP is detected by this principle and the
</p>
<p>operating point track the real MPP with little oscillations regarding to step size [24,
</p>
<p>25, 29, 32]. The characteristics of a typical PV cell under regular irradiance and
</p>
<p>partial shading conditions are illustrated in Fig. 8.10 where the MPP dot depicts the
</p>
<p>current source and voltage source operation of PV module. If the operating point of
</p>
<p>the load is on the left-hand side of MPP, it means the module operates as a current
</p>
<p>source and the error signal M required by Hill-Climbing HC MPPT is calculated as
</p>
<p>given in (8.14);
</p>
<p>If the operating point of the load is on the right-hand side of MPP, then PV
</p>
<p>module acts as a voltage source, and M is calculated as follows;
</p>
<p>@PPV
</p>
<p>@VPV
[ 0 ) M &frac14; M&thorn;DM &eth;8:13&THORN;
</p>
<p>@PPV
</p>
<p>@VPV
\0 ) M &frac14; M � DM &eth;8:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>Apparently, the error signal will be zero at the MPP that yield DM = 0. This
</p>
<p>approach is applied at several direct MPPT methods where the most outstanding
</p>
<p>algorithms are P&amp;O and Incremental Conductance (IncCon) [29, 31, 32].

<p>8.5.1 Perturb and Observe MPPT Algorithm
</p>
<p>The P&amp;O algorithm is one of the most widely used and studied method owing to its
</p>
<p>simplicity and practical implementation. It perturbs the terminal voltage, as its name
</p>
<p>implies, and compares the actual PV power to previous value. The algorithm
</p>
<p>decides to track the MPP in one direction or in the opposite direction by comparing
</p>
<p>the terminal voltage change and output power increment. In case the output power
</p>
<p>is increased against the voltage change, the algorithm keeps on tracking the MPP in
</p>
<p>the same direction. Otherwise, it shifts the tracking direction [4, 26, 32, 33].
</p>
<p>There are several textbooks and papers can be found on regular P&amp;O algorithm
</p>
<p>in the literature. However, the main attention should be directed to improve instead
</p>
<p>of applying the regular P&amp;O. The flowchart of an improved algorithm proposed by
</p>
<p>Dolara et al. [26] is shown in Fig. 8.11 where the power and voltage perturbations
</p>
<p>are detected in the progress, and then the voltage difference is detected to operate
</p>
<p>the algorithm. In the proposed method, the array power is sampled to generate an
</p>

<p>average value, and is used for arranging the magnitude of perturbation Dd at the
</p>
<p>MPP operating point.
</p>
<p>The arrangement is performed by calculating the a(n) regarding to voltage error
</p>
<p>signal M and power to voltage ratios as shown on the right-hand side of flowchart.
</p>
<p>The duty cycle is varied around 0.5% for each regular P&amp;O methods. However, the
</p>
<p>proposed algorithm in [26] tries to adjust the duty cycle variation between 0.5% and
</p>
<p>2.7% in the next turn regarding to k coefficient, a (n), and Dd where it is equated as
</p>
<p>follows;
</p>
<p>d&eth;n&thorn; 1&THORN;&frac14; d&eth;n&THORN; + k � a&eth;n&THORN; � Dd &eth;8:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>An improved P&amp;O MPPT method with PI control is proposed by Kabalci et al.
</p>
<p>[34, 35] where the schematic diagram of combined controller is illustrated in
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.12. The MPPT control of converters are improved with additional PI to
</p>
<p>regular P&amp;O algorithm where measurements of solar array, dc converter, and
</p>
<p>control diagram of PI controller are shown on the left-hand side of Fig. 8.12. The
</p>
<p>flowchart of the improved PI controlled MPPT algorithm is depicted in Fig. 8.13
</p>
<p>where additional PI calculation is managed by the error calculation segment on the
</p>
<p>flowchart.
</p>
<p>The flowchart of MPPT algorithm is depended on voltage and power calcula-
</p>
<p>tions that are based on current and voltage values acquired from sensors [34].
</p>
<p>Once the actual power is calculated, then the next cycle of the measurement is
</p>
<p>compared to previous value to track the reference voltage Vref. The implemented
</p>
<p>control section that the upper and lower parts of detailed PI controller block exhibit
</p>
<p>P&amp;O detection part while the middle part on the left hand side of figure illustrates
</p>
<p>the PI control added to MPPT algorithm considering Kp and Ki parameters of the
</p>

<p>system. The actual inputs and reference outputs are switched as seen in the center of
</p>
<p>PI controller block and modulating signal is conditioned by the zero-order sample
</p>
<p>and hold block. The logical comparator compares the triangular carrier signal and
</p>
<p>modulating signals to generate the PWM at each interval where the actual power
</p>
<p>measurement is repeated [34].
</p>
<p>In order to determine duty ratio the latest observation of the obtained power is
</p>
<p>compared to the previous observation. Afterwards, ensured difference is used to
</p>
<p>specify the next PWM duty cycle. The implemented P&amp;O algorithm looks for the
</p>
<p>increment of power perturbation and attempts to keep the duty cycle in the same
</p>
<p>way in order to achieve the MPP of PV array, also PI control is activated to reduce
</p>
<p>oscillation on the output voltage. The algorithm can reverse the perturbation when
</p>
<p>there is a decrement occurs in the power observation. The algorithm repeats this
</p>
<p>process for reach to MPP of PV array, if the system reaches to the MPP; the
</p>
<p>algorithm produces steady duty cycle value. The oscillation at the MPP of PV array
</p>
<p>is demanded to be reduced in order to increase the stability [35, 36]. The PI

<p>function, which is used to reduce oscillation on the output voltage is calculated as

<p>8.5.2 Incremental Conductance MPPT Algorithm
</p>
<p>The incremental conductance InCon algorithm depends on the detection of the
</p>
<p>slope occurred in the PV curve. The slope is zero when the MPP of the curve is
</p>
<p>reached as shown in Fig. 8.10. The movement direction of operating point is
</p>
<p>detected by tracking the change occurred in the I/V ratio comparing to the MPP
</p>
<p>point. The operating point increases the slope when it is moving towards to the
</p>
<p>MPP, while it turns negative on the right side of MPP. This situation can be
</p>
<p>expressed as follows [25, 37&ndash;39];
</p>
<p>dI
</p>
<p>dV
&frac14; �
</p>

</p>
<p>; at right of MPP
</p>
<p>&eth;8:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>The Eq. (8.17) and flowchart given in Fig. 8.14 are based on the instant con-
</p>
<p>ductance (I/V) and the incremental conductance (dI/dV) of PV array where the
</p>
<p>reference voltage is calculated regarding to incremental value in an iteration that is
</p>
<p>repeated until MPP is reached. Once the VRef acquired at the MPP, the algorithm
</p>
<p>maintains to track this value in order to ensure maximum output power. In case a
</p>
<p>change occurs in PV current dI, algorithm starts a new iteration at the beginning of
</p>
<p>the flowchart to track VRef by increasing or decreasing the previous value.
</p>
<p>When the irradiance increases on the PV array, the array voltage is increased and
</p>
<p>the MPP moves to the right-hand side as can be seen on Fig. 8.10. The algorithm
</p>
<p>increases the operating voltage of PV array for compensating this increment. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, the decrement on irradiance triggers the algorithm to decrease the
</p>
<p>operating voltage of array in order to compensate the change. That is the way that
</p>
<p>InCon algorithm track the slope value to detect the change on irradiance and react
</p>
<p>against the cases. The easier way to determine the change is comparing previous
</p>
<p>and actual values of voltage and current that are depicted as dV and dI in the
</p>
<p>224 E. Kabalci</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>algorithm. The dV and dI are zero when the irradiance and temperature are stable,
</p>
<p>and algorithm maintains to operate at MPP.
</p>
<p>If the irradiance increases, it causes an increment on dI (dI &gt; 0) while dV = 0 that
</p>
<p>also means the MPP is being increased by irradiance. The algorithm decides to
</p>
<p>increase the operating voltage at this stage. On the other hand, the decrement on
</p>
<p>irradiance causes to dI &lt; 0 that requires to decrease the operating voltage. The
</p>
<p>rapidly changing cases are easily detected by InCon algorithm since it depends on
</p>
<p>tracking the operating point towards MPP. This approach prevents misleading in
</p>
<p>tracking as seen in P&amp;O algorithm, and that makes InConmore reliable by decreasing
</p>
<p>the perturbation aroundMPP. However, there are several drawbacks of this algorithm
</p>
<p>related to MPP as others. Tey andMekhilef [40] proposed an optimized alternative to
</p>
<p>regular incremental conductance method by increasing the step size that is named as
</p>
<p>variable step size InCon. The algorithm is based on defining a step size to compensate
</p>
<p>the variations on MPP change and increasing or decreasing the duty cycle consid-
</p>
<p>ering this step size additional to previous duty cycle. Thus, an error rate is permitted
</p>
<p>by algorithm and the step size is adjusted to maintain the error control in the limit.
</p>
<p>There are several methods are proposed to optimize regular MPPT methods.
</p>
<p>However, the numerical methods including FLCs, Neural network controlled

<p>algorithms, and some other soft computing methods are applied to improve existing
</p>
<p>methods. The rapidly adapting structures, complexity, and sophisticated approaches
</p>
<p>of these algorithms increase the reliability of regular MPPT methods.

<p>8.6 Artificial MPPT Algorithms
</p>
<p>The most widely used MPPT methods are introduced in 4th and 5th sections. There
</p>
<p>are several other methods are also proposed in the literature including non-linear
</p>
<p>and sliding mode control methods in order to improve the stability and efficiency of
</p>
<p>regular MPPT algorithms such as perturb and observer or incremental conductance.
</p>
<p>However, the main drawbacks seen in the proposed methods are caused by irra-
</p>
<p>diation and cell temperature that are not robustly handled by existing algorithms.
</p>
<p>The widely known methods are based on discontinuous control strategy where the
</p>
<p>intersection tracking is performed around the MPP. The tracking approach of the
</p>
<p>previously introduced algorithms lack in efficiency since they are not supported by
</p>
<p>intelligent controls and are less efficient against the rapidly changing conditions
</p>
<p>[41&ndash;44]. Furthermore, the existing methods do not pay attention to measurement
</p>
<p>noises of voltage and current that has significant effect on the algorithm decisions.
</p>
<p>These drawbacks require fast time response and increased stability comparing to
</p>
<p>widely known methods. The oscillations occurred in the acquired power output
</p>
<p>should be decreased in order to decrease power losses. The latest improvements in
</p>
<p>MPPT methods are performed by using several numerical and artificial methods
</p>
<p>including FLC, neural network, neuro-fuzzy, genetic algorithm, and some opti-
</p>
<p>mization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony etc.
</p>
<p>The FLC is one of the simplest algorithms among other artificial methods. Recently,
</p>
<p>an increasing attention paid to FLC based MPPT algorithms owing to its robust
</p>
<p>response against unpredictable air conditions and its simple structure not requiring
</p>
<p>complex mathematical arrangements. The neural networks are also being exten-
</p>
<p>sively studied owing to their high level control structure and sophisticated man-
</p>
<p>agement features [42, 43]. The following subsections are dedicated to artificial
</p>
<p>methods used in MPPT algorithms with analyses.
</p>
<p>8.6.1 Fuzzy Logic Control MPPT
</p>
<p>The combining artificial intelligence with regular MPPT algorithms is a new trend
</p>
<p>of research and application in renewable energy sources. FLC is the most widely
</p>
<p>researched artificial method in MPPT applications since it provides better perfor-
</p>
<p>mance comparing the conventional methods, and involves simpler requirements
</p>
<p>comparing to sophisticate neural or estimation algorithms. These advantages of
</p>
<p>FLC are integrated to overall system by combining it to existing MPPT controller
</p>
<p>that provides to acquire maximum power transfer to the loads.

<p>The block diagram of a FLC based MPPT controller is depicted in Fig. 8.15
</p>
<p>where the contents of a regular FLC are also shown in a significant block. The
</p>
<p>reference input of FLC is used to determine the error signal E and change rate of the
</p>
<p>error CE where it is shown on the left-hand side of figure. The output of FLC is the
</p>
<p>duty cycle that is applied to converter where it is generated by the four sections of
</p>
<p>FLC. These sections are fuzzification where the numerical inputs are converted to
</p>
<p>lexical variables that are defined by rule base and depended to membership func-
</p>
<p>tions. The levels of membership functions can be increased to present better res-
</p>
<p>olution in the calculations. The analyzed inputs are weighted according to several
</p>
<p>methods, namely modus ponens, Takagi-Sugeno or Mamdani, in the inference
</p>
<p>section, and then the lexical outputs of FLC are converted to numbers in the
</p>
<p>defuzzification section in order to generate the duty cycle. The most widely used
</p>
<p>defuzzification method is the is the centroid of area (COA) owing to its successful
</p>
<p>averaging properties and more accurate results [41, 42, 44]. The integration of FLC
</p>
<p>to the regular P&amp;O algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 8.16 where the decision making
</p>
<p>against output power is performed regarding to the power and voltage perturbation
</p>
<p>by FLC controller that generates the adaptive duty cycle.
</p>
<p>8.6.2 Neural Network MPPT
</p>
<p>The most recent researches on computational MPPT methods include ANN studies
</p>
<p>that are significantly effective on wide disruptive conditions such as partial shading
</p>
<p>[45, 46]. The ANN based MPPT provides rapid and reliable estimations against
</p>
<p>quickly varying irradiance and temperature parameters. An ANN is composed of
</p>
<p>several layers in multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure as shown in Fig. 8.17. In a
</p>
<p>model as shown in figure, the neural-like organization is comprised of neurons seen
</p>
<p>in the lower part of figure where the inputs are linearly weighted and summed in a
</p>
<p>function. The sum of weighted input are transferred to a nonlinear function called
</p>

<p>activation function (AF), and lastly are sent to the following neurons. The definition
</p>
<p>of input function in AF is depicted as given in Eq. (8.18);
</p>
<p>x &frac14;

<p>M
</p>
<p>m&frac14;1
</p>
<p>wmxm &thorn; a &eth;8:18&THORN;
</p>
<p>where x1; x2; . . .; xm are input signals, and w1;w2; . . .;wm are the weights of each
</p>
<p>input signal [45].
</p>
<p>The weights define the significance of each input data and the learning operation
</p>
<p>of the network is performed regarding to continuously varying weights. The
</p>
<p>training set of the ANN is composed with several different input and output data
</p>
<p>where they are voltage and current in inputs and MPP voltage at the output as seen
</p>
<p>in Fig. 8.17. There are several ANN based MPPT operation approaches are pro-
</p>
<p>posed. In one hand, some ANN algorithms integrated to regular MPPT methods use
</p>
<p>irradiance and temperature measurement acquired from separate sensors and
</p>

<p>directly generates variable duty cycle. On the other hand, the measured irradiation
</p>
<p>and temperature data are used to detect the voltage and current of PV module in
</p>
<p>other ANN MPPT group. The second group is widely used rather than first one and
</p>
<p>it is constructed with MLP structure [46&ndash;48].
</p>
<p>8.6.3 Particle Swarm Optimization MPPT Algorithm
</p>
<p>Particle swarm optimization PSO is a novel swarm optimization algorithm that is
</p>
<p>firstly proposed by Kennedy as an evolutionary algorithm based on behavior of
</p>
<p>birds [49, 50]. PSO uses a set of particles that each one suggests a solution to the
</p>
<p>optimization problem. It is based on the success of all particles that emulates a
</p>
<p>population where the position of each particle depends to the agent position to
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>detect the best solution Pbest by using current particles in the population G. The
</p>
<p>position of any particle xi is adjusted by
</p>
<p>xk&thorn; 1i &frac14; x
k
i &thorn; vi &eth;8:19&THORN;
</p>
<p>where the velocity component vi represents the step size and is calculated by using
</p>
<p>the Eq. (8.20);
</p>
<p>vk&thorn; 1i &frac14; xv
k
i &thorn; c1r1&eth;Pbest i � x
</p>
<p>k
i &THORN;&thorn; c2r2&eth;G� x
</p>
<p>k
i &THORN; &eth;8:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>where x is the inertial weight, c1 and c2 are the acceleration coefficients, r1 and r2
are random values that belong to the interval of [0, 1], Pbest_i is the best position of
</p>
<p>particle i, and G is the best position in the entire population [50].
</p>
<p>A typical MPPT method should be used to integrate PSO algorithm to controller.
</p>
<p>Most widely used integration is based on hill-climbing or P&amp;O algorithm to PSO.
</p>
<p>The flowchart of a PSO MPPT algorithm is depicted in Fig. 8.18. The operation
</p>
<p>given in flowchart can be analyzed in five steps that are initialization, fitness
</p>
<p>evaluation, updating the individual and global best value, updating the velocity and
</p>
<p>position of each particle, and convergence determination [51]. In the first step,
</p>
<p>particles are randomly initialized in the distribution space, or are initialized on
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.18 Flowchart of PSO MPPT algorithm
</p>
<p>230 E. Kabalci</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>described grid nodes covering the search space. Similarly, the initial velocity values
</p>
<p>are defined randomly. The fitness value of each particle is evaluated in the second
</p>
<p>step where the fitness evaluation is leaded to provide candidate solution to the
</p>
<p>objective function.
</p>
<p>The individual and global best fitness values are determined in the third step
</p>
<p>where pbest_i and gbest are respectively determined. Then the positions are updated
</p>
<p>and replaced with better fitness values if they are found. The velocity and position
</p>
<p>of each particle are updated in the fourth step respecting to Eqs. (8.19) and (8.20).
</p>
<p>The last step of the flowchart checks the convergence criterion. If the criterion is
</p>
<p>met, the process is finished. Otherwise, the iteration number is increased and
</p>
<p>procedure returns to step 2 [51&ndash;53].
</p>
<p>The application of PSO MPPT in a PV system is depended to the matching
</p>
<p>definitions of both systems. The particle positions are used to define the duty cycle
</p>
<p>of dc converter, and the fitness value evaluation function stands for the output
</p>
<p>power of PV array. The success of algorithm is performed by increasing the number
</p>
<p>of particles that provides more accurate MPP tracking operation, even for shading
</p>
<p>problems. On the other hand, increased number of particles causes to longer
</p>
<p>computation times. The particle number is usually selected as the number of series
</p>
<p>connected cells in a PV array in order to obtain the most exact operation time.
</p>
<p>The particles are placed either on fixed positions or on random places in the PSO
</p>
<p>initialization step. It depends on the information about global MPP since the par-
</p>
<p>ticles can be placed around the point, if there is any information about it. The PV
</p>
<p>voltage and current are measured and digitally filtered by using finite impulse
</p>
<p>response filters in order to calculate the fitness value, PPV of particle i. The cal-
</p>
<p>culated fitness value is compare to the best fitness value in order to keep pbest_i or to
</p>
<p>update it with the new pbest_i in case of better fitness value. The velocity and
</p>
<p>positions of all particles are updated and convergence criteria are controlled to
</p>
<p>generate the best control signal [51&ndash;53].
</p>
<p>The dependency to pbest_i and gbest is the main problem of conventional PSO
</p>
<p>algorithm under nonlinear shading conditions. Since there are several PSO methods
</p>
<p>proposed in the literature. The outstanding alternative to classical PSO are deter-
</p>
<p>ministic and dormant PSOs [52, 53].
</p>
<p>8.7 Conclusions
</p>
<p>This chapter deals with most widely used and recent trends in MPPT algorithms.
</p>
<p>The literature reviews show that several methods are proposed to track the MPP in a
</p>
<p>PV power system. The main concerns of all the proposed algorithms are fast
</p>
<p>response, reliable tracking, and easy implementation. The power conversion devi-
</p>
<p>ces and configurations are improved to increase acquired energy level of a solar
</p>
<p>plant. Although there are various structures proposed in literature, double-stage
</p>
<p>power conversion holds the great share of usage in residential and industrial plants.
</p>
<p>The first stage is comprised of dc-dc converters while the second stage performs
</p>
<p>8 Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Algorithms &hellip; 231</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>dc-ac conversion by using inverters. The dc interface requires robust control
</p>
<p>methods to increase converted energy under heavily or partially shaded conditions.
</p>
<p>The MPPT algorithms are focused on coping with irradiance and temperature
</p>
<p>variations to balance the acquired total output power.
</p>
<p>The preliminary algorithms classified as indirect algorithms are based on several
</p>
<p>calculation methods including system voltage adjustment, temperature measure-
</p>
<p>ment, open-circuit voltage VOC calculation, and azimuth and angle calculation
</p>
<p>sometimes. These methods lack on responding against rapidly changing weather
</p>
<p>conditions. The direct methods that includes hill-climbing, P&amp;O, and indirect
</p>
<p>conductance are proposed to tackle this situation. The basic operation principles of
</p>
<p>direct MPPT algorithms are based on periodic tuning of I-V and P-V curves, and
</p>
<p>adjusting the operating voltage in small steps to increase the accuracy. The
</p>
<p>decreased step size and effective measurement methods increased the reliability of
</p>
<p>direct MPPT methods. However, the researches exhibited the perturbation issue
</p>
<p>seen around the MPP can be overcome with computational methods. Their simple
</p>
<p>analytical background led the main drawback of direct methods. Therefore, more
</p>
<p>sophisticated and complex algorithms were researched to prevent the perturbations
</p>
<p>occurred in power curve of PV arrays.
</p>
<p>A wide variety of numerical methods including fuzzy logic, neural networks and
</p>
<p>other computational methods are proposed. The most recent computational algo-
</p>
<p>rithms including GAs, PSO algorithms, and ABC are prominent topics in MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithms. The trade-off between conventional MPPT methods and recent algo-
</p>
<p>rithms are related to complexity in algorithm and increased cost in application.
</p>
<p>However, improved efficiency and fast response leads to extensive researches.

</p>
<p>Abstract Solar energy is one of the most important energy, which is environ-
</p>
<p>mentally friendly such as clean, inexhaustible and free, among the renewable
</p>
<p>energy sources. Studies on solar photovoltaic (PV) energy generation system were
</p>
<p>promoted in last two decades. The main application of PV systems are in
</p>
<p>stand-alone (water pumping, lighting, electrical vehicle, etc.), hybrid and
</p>
<p>grid-connected (PV power plants) configuration. Stand-alone PV power generation
</p>
<p>system is considered as good alternative for places that are far from conventional
</p>
<p>power generation/transmission/distribution system. PV generation systems have
</p>
<p>two big problems; PV conversion efficiency is very low and PV electricity gen-
</p>
<p>eration is effected from changing of weather condition. PV output varies periodi-
</p>
<p>cally in a year and in a day, and is not stable due to environmental condition.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, in order to increase PV output and PV efficiency, it is crucial to
</p>
<p>analyze PV output considering solar radiation, temperature, wind speed, shadow,
</p>
<p>etc. Maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) are employed for extracting power
</p>
<p>from photovoltaic (PV) panels. MPPTs enforce the solar modules to operate at
</p>
<p>maximum power point (MPP) under the fluctuations of ambient conditions.
</p>
<p>Therefore, they take a vital role for increasing of PV system efficiency. In this part,
</p>
<p>the case studies of MPPT system, which includes stand-alone and hybrid PV
</p>
<p>systems, will be briefly reviewed, followed by discussion of the MPPT modeling,
</p>
<p>design, etc. Several stand-alone and hybrid MPPT application will be presented.
</p>
<p>Latest developments in MPPT methods will be summarized. Finally some of the

<p>9.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Solar energy is one of the most important energy, which is environmentally friendly
</p>
<p>such as clean, inexhaustible and free, among the renewable energy sources [1].
</p>
<p>Studies on solar photovoltaic (PV) energy generation system were promoted in last
</p>
<p>two decades. The main application of PV systems are in stand-alone (water
</p>
<p>pumping, lighting, electrical vehicle, etc.), hybrid and grid-connected (PV power
</p>
<p>plants) configuration. Stand-alone PV power generation system is considered as
</p>
<p>good alternative for places that are far from conventional power generation/
</p>
<p>transmission/distribution system. Such systems applications presented in two scale:
</p>
<p>application at a small scale from 1 to 10 kW and stand-alone PV system in size,
</p>
<p>from 10 to 100 kW [2]. In hybrid PV systems, more than one type of electricity
</p>
<p>generator, such as wind turbine, fuel cell, diesel generator, etc., is employed. In
</p>
<p>grid-connected PV systems, it is usual practice to connect PV system to the elec-
</p>
<p>tricity grid [3]. A grid-connected PV system provides parallel work with the already
</p>
<p>established electricity grid and number of PV system features are determined by this
</p>
<p>connection to the utility grid [4]. PV capacity in the world, including stand-alone,
</p>
<p>hybrid and grid connected, is rapidly increasing. Figure 9.1 shows the global PV
</p>
<p>total capacity from 2004 to 2014.
</p>
<p>It is clear from the Fig. 9.1 that, 40 GW capacity added in 2014 and also more
</p>
<p>than 60% of all PV capacity in operation worldwide at the end of 2014 was added
</p>
<p>over the past 3 years [5].
</p>
<p>PV generation systems have two big problems; PV conversion efficiency is very
</p>
<p>low and PV electricity generation is effected from changing of weather condition
</p>
<p>[6]. PV output varies periodically in a year and in a day, and is not stable due to
</p>
<p>environmental condition. Accordingly, in order to increase PV output and PV
</p>
<p>efficiency, it is crucial to analyze PV output considering solar radiation, tempera-
</p>
<p>ture, wind speed, shadow, etc.
</p>
<p>Maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) are employed for extracting power
</p>
<p>from photovoltaic (PV) panels. MPPTs enforce the solar modules to operate at MPP
</p>
<p>under the fluctuations of ambient conditions. Therefore, they take a vital role for
</p>
<p>236 A. Durusu et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>increasing of PV system efficiency. Different MPPT algorithms are used for the
</p>
<p>determination of MPP. These algorithms are divided into two groups: direct and
</p>
<p>indirect. In indirect algorithms, the operating point, where PV generator operates
</p>
<p>with maximum power, is estimated either measuring current, voltage and radiation
</p>
<p>values or with numerical approximations-mathematical expressions using experi-
</p>
<p>mental data. In direct algorithms, the maximum power point is not obtained by
</p>
<p>procedures on the contrary to indirect algorithms; the system is forced to operate at
</p>
<p>MPP. Direct and indirect methods used for determination of maximum power point
</p>
<p>are examined in the literature. A detailed review of these algorithms is done by
</p>
<p>Salas et al. [2] and advantages and disadvantages of the algorithms are given. In a
</p>
<p>study conducted by Berrera et al. [1], seven commonly used MPPT algorithms&rsquo;
</p>
<p>MPP tracking performance are compared for two different radiation profiles under
</p>
<p>standard test conditions. Among the seven generally adopted algorithms,
</p>
<p>Perturbation and Observe (P&amp;O) algorithm shows the best performance for two
</p>
<p>different radiation profiles. M. Berrera also states that, Incremental Conductance
</p>
<p>(IC) algorithm can be a good alternative to P&amp;O algorithm under rapid and con-
</p>
<p>tinuous irradiance variations. Esram et al. [7], made a comparison of nineteen
</p>
<p>different MPPT methods according to their cost and performance. The authors state
</p>
<p>that different algorithms can be suitable for different practice areas. Hohm et al. [8]
</p>
<p>focus on comparison of three MPPT methods i.e., P&amp;O, IC and Constant Voltage
</p>
<p>(CV) algorithms, using a PV array simulator. Their performance comparison results
</p>
<p>show that P&amp;O algorithm is very competitive against other MPP tracking algo-
</p>
<p>rithms and can have a better performance in excess of 97%. The study carried out
</p>
<p>by Hua et al. [9] shows the performance comparison of voltage feedback control,
</p>
<p>power feedback control and widely used P&amp;O and IC MPPT methods for two
</p>
<p>different radiation condition. In result of their comparison, among three algorithms
</p>
<p>IC method shows best performance under two radiation conditions. Reisi et al. [10]
</p>
<p>compares different MPPT methods with simulation models under Matlab/Simulink.

<p>Their study introduces a classification for MPPT methods based on three categories:
</p>
<p>hybrid, online and offline methods. As a result of their study, they provide a
</p>
<p>selection guide of appropriate MPPT methods. Subudhi et al. [11] makes a com-
</p>
<p>prehensive comparison study based on features, like control variables, control
</p>
<p>strategies, circuitry and approximate costs. Their comparison results offer a useful
</p>
<p>tool not only for the MPPT users but also the designers and manufacturers of the
</p>
<p>PV systems. Brito et al. [12] performs the comparison of usual MPPT methods
</p>
<p>using solar array simulator. They made a comparison between twelve methods with
</p>
<p>respect to the amount of energy obtained from PV. The authors state that perfor-
</p>
<p>mance differences among the best MPPTs are very slight, and these algorithms must
</p>
<p>be evaluated according to each situation.
</p>
<p>In this part, the case studies of MPPT system, which includes stand-alone and
</p>
<p>hybrid PV systems, will be briefly reviewed, followed by discussion of the MPPT
</p>
<p>modeling, design, etc. Several stand-alone and hybrid MPPT application will be
</p>
<p>presented. Latest developments in MPPT methods will be summarized. Finally some
</p>
<p>of the present challenges facing the MPPT techniques will be explored. This chapter
</p>
<p>structured as follows: Sect. 9.2 describes the MPPT techniques and MPPT algo-
</p>
<p>rithms modeling; Sect. 9.3 presents the case studies of MPPT techniques, which
</p>
<p>includes stand-alone and hybrid PV systems; in Sect. 9.4, performance comparison
</p>
<p>of MPPTs are depicted and at last this part concluded with related discussion.
</p>
<p>9.2 Maximum Power Point Tracker
</p>
<p>Different MPPT algorithms are used for the determination of MPP. These algo-
</p>
<p>rithms are divided into two groups: direct and indirect. The direct methods are;
</p>
<p>sampling methods, methodology by modulation and other methods. The indirect
</p>
<p>methods are; curve-fitting, look-up table, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current
</p>
<p>and open-circuit voltage of test modules.
</p>
<p>9.2.1 Modeling of MPPT Algorithms
</p>
<p>This part is presented as a summary of our published conference paper [13]. MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithms control the PV output to take the PV power to the maximum power
</p>
<p>point. This control is basically changing of duty-cycle of the dc-dc converter.
</p>
<p>Duty-cycle changing decision depends on the: PV current in only current photo-
</p>
<p>voltaic (OC) algorithm, short circuit current in short-circuit current (SC) algorithm,
</p>
<p>PV current and voltage in P&amp;O and IC algorithms. Basic grid-connected PV-battery
</p>
<p>hybrid system is depicted in Fig. 9.2.
</p>
<p>Control part of the dashed diagram (MPPT) in Fig. 9.2 is a MPPT algorithm.
</p>
<p>Control and Duty part of the MPPT system is depicted as a Matlab/Simulink model
</p>
<p>in Fig. 9.3.

</p>
<p>MPPT system. In Fig. 9.3, PV output current, PV output voltage and C (the
</p>

</p>
<p>algorithm which is converted to PWM signal.
</p>
<p>In this part, Matlab/Stateflow based modeling methodology of four commonly
</p>
<p>used MPPT algorithms (SC, OC, P&amp;O and IC) are presented. Stateflow is an envi-
</p>
<p>ronment for modeling and simulating combinatorial and sequential decision logic
</p>
<p>based on state machines and flow charts. Stateflow provides combine tabular and
</p>
<p>graphical representations, including flow charts, state transition diagrams, state
</p>
<p>transition tables and truth tables to model how your system reacts to events,
</p>
<p>time-based conditions, and external input signals.With Stateflowyou can design logic
</p>
<p>for supervisory control, task scheduling, and fault management applications [14].
</p>
<p>9.2.1.1 Perturbation and Observe Algorithm
</p>
<p>Perturbation and Observe algorithm uses an iterative method to extract maximum
</p>
<p>power from PV. P&amp;O algorithm measures the power values of PV array and then
</p>
<p>compares the measured power with prior power to perturb the operation point of
</p>
<p>PV. If the PV power error is positive, then it changes the duty in same direction. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, if the PV power error is negative, then it changes the duty in reverse

<p>9.2.1.2 Incremental Conductance Algorithm
</p>
<p>IC algorithm forced the PV to the MPP based on the observation of conductivity by
</p>
<p>taking the instantaneous output voltage and output current of PV. Conductivity
</p>
<p>observation is based on the differentiation of PV power with respect to the PV
</p>
<p>voltage and setting result to zero. Equations (9.1) and (9.2) give the conductivity

<p>observation of the IC method [2].

</p>
<p>9.3.1.1 Widely-Used MPPT Algorithms Comparison
</p>
<p>In this part, unlike the MPPT performance studies which are investigated before,
</p>
<p>four commonly used MPPT algorithms performances are compared under real
</p>
<p>ambient conditions. The MPP tracking systems are realized with an experimental
</p>
<p>setup, which is capable of running four commonly used MPPT algorithms (P&amp;O,
</p>
<p>IC, OC and SC). As a result under real environmental condition, the performances
</p>
<p>of the MPPT algorithms are measured and compared [16].
</p>
<p>The realized experimental setup is constituted of five main elements: control
</p>
<p>unit, the dc-dc converters, battery, two identical PV panels and a power analyzer for
</p>
<p>measuring PV module output values. Figure 9.8 shows the block diagram of the

<p>experimental setup. Identical boost type dc-dc converters are connected identical
</p>
<p>PV panels which are fixed at same position. Dc-dc converters are controlled by the
</p>
<p>same controller (dSpace). 24 V battery bank is connected to the dc-dc converters&rsquo;
</p>
<p>outputs [15].
</p>
<p>Step-up type dc-dc converters are employed for the comparison. All of four
</p>
<p>above mentioned MPPT algorithms can be easily obtained by changing the control
</p>
<p>algorithm in the control system. Detailed information about dc-dc converter is given
</p>
<p>in [1]. Converters are operated at 35 kHz frequency. Dc-dc converters control is
</p>
<p>based on the current and voltage measurements of PV panels which are obtained by
</p>
<p>hall-effect sensors. Designed power boards and dc-dc converter circuit are depicted
</p>
<p>in Fig. 9.9. Figure 9.9a also shows that, there is a S1 switch which is necessary for
</p>
<p>measuring the short circuit current of PV for the SC method.
</p>
<p>MPPT algorithms are designed in Matlab/Stateflow Toolbar. Dc-dc converters
</p>
<p>are controlled by running the algorithms in the dSpace. Herein, algorithm codes are
</p>
<p>generated in Matlab-Simulink. Basic control scheme of the test bench is shown in

<p>This part presents performance comparison of IC, P&amp;O and OC algorithms

<p>examined under real environmental conditions. Performance of algorithms are

<p>The test bench employed for performance evaluation of MPPT algorithms is

<p>constituted from a measurement system (power analyzer) for measuring output
</p>
<p>power of PV modules, two identical dc-dc converters, two identical PV modules
</p>
<p>and control unit for employing three MPPT algorithms. The basic block scheme of
</p>
<p>the test bench is illustrated in Fig. 9.11. PV modules are mounted on test platform
</p>
<p>to simulate fluctuating irradiance of solar panels on a vehicle in motion. This
</p>
<p>platform can change both azimuth angle and tilt angle of PV modules. In this study,
</p>
<p>the platform is moved regarding to a defined motion loop to test realizations of three

<p>MPPT algorithms with variation of solar irradiance.
</p>
<p>Motion loop of the platform consist of four time intervals and motion ratio of

<p>platform is increased at each time interval to simulate fluctuation of solar irradiance
</p>
<p>with different ratios. This motion loop makes possible to verify responses of MPPT

<p>algorithms to the variation of solar irradiance. Consequently, the test platform can

<p>9.3.2 Hybrid System Application
</p>
<p>Hybrid system applications are given in this part as a summary of our previous

<p>published paper [17]. In this part, wind-solar-battery hybrid system constructed on
</p>
<p>the roof of Electrical Engineering Department Building, Yildiz Technical
</p>
<p>University, Istanbul, Turkey is studied. A wind turbine which is equipped with
</p>
<p>permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), two PV arrays and battery
</p>
<p>group are employed as hybrid system equipment in the system. In addition, an
</p>
<p>inverter, a MPPT controller and a hybrid charge controller are employed as power

<p>conditioner unit. A measurement and a data logging system are also exist in the
</p>
<p>hybrid system. It is planned to realize reliability analysis and wind/solar energy
</p>
<p>potential of investigated area with measurements.
</p>
<p>Hybrid system has eight PV modules. PV modules are divided into two groups.
</p>
<p>One of the groups (PV1: four modules) is connected to hybrid charge controller
</p>
<p>with wind turbines. The other PV group (PV2: four modules) is connected to the
</p>
<p>MPPT charge controller. Hybrid charge controller and MPPT charge controller are
</p>
<p>connected to 24 V DC bus. Battery group has two series (for reaching the DC bus
</p>
<p>voltage level) and two parallel elements. Figure 9.14 illustrates the basic block
</p>
<p>scheme of the wind-solar-battery hybrid system.

<p>9.4 Performance Comparison of the MPPTs
</p>
<p>9.4.1 Widely-Used MPPT Algorithms Comparison
</p>
<p>In this section, the experimental system performances of four algorithms are pre-
</p>
<p>sented. In this study two identical dc-dc converters are connected to two identical
</p>
<p>PV panels. These dc-dc converters are controlled by two different MPPT algorithms
</p>
<p>for a period of 240 s. This comparison process is carried out until all algorithms&rsquo;
</p>
<p>comparisons with each other are done. Because two algorithms are compared
</p>
<p>together on same platform and environmental conditions are same for each PV
</p>
<p>panel in all comparisons [15].
</p>
<p>In order to analyze the performance of fourMPP tracking algorithms, algorithms are
</p>
<p>experimentally compared under medium-high (540&ndash;640 W/m2) radiation level. This
</p>
<p>comparison process is carried out between 13:35 pm and 14:35 pm time intervals on
</p>
<p>26 Dec. 2012. Figure 9.17 shows the wind speed and ambient temperature variation
</p>
<p>between 13:35 pm and 14:35 pm (1 h) during the comparison process. As it can be
</p>
<p>seen in Fig. 9.17, while ambient temperature is almost stable, wind speed change
</p>
<p>between 1&ndash;5 m/s. Wind speed decreases the PV temperature which is one of the
</p>
<p>affecting factor of PV performance.Wind speed variation is neglected in this study due
</p>
<p>to the PV performance is mainly affected from temperature and radiation. The output
</p>
<p>power values of PV modules employed by each algorithm are depicted in Fig. 9.18.
</p>
<p>Numerical result of these comparisons are given in Table 9.5. The test results
</p>
<p>show that real environmental conditions, IC algorithm is the most successful MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithm. However P&amp;O algorithm performance is very close to the IC algorithm.
</p>
<p>When the P&amp;O algorithm is optimized, the MPP tracking performance of IC and
</p>
<p>P&amp;O algorithms will be the same. The IC algorithm success based on [15];
</p>
<p>&bull; IC algorithm oscillates around the MPP less then P&amp;O algorithm,
</p>
<p>&bull; IC algorithm does not diverge from MPP under rapidly changing radiation,
</p>
<p>&bull; IC algorithm uses PV current and voltage to track the MPP,
</p>
<p>&bull; IC algorithm does not cut the power flow for measuring the PV current/voltage.

<p>9.4.2 Vehicle Integrated Solar System
</p>
<p>This part presents performance comparison results related to the three MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithms. Three different algorithms compared as couples between each other and
</p>
<p>power values are measured. Power output values of each algorithm and the solar
</p>
<p>radiation variation on PV modules are illustrated in Fig. 9.19.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 9.19b, power output result of OC and IC algorithms are depicted.
</p>
<p>Figure 9.19 confirms natural expectation, that power outputs of both algorithms are

<p>similar with solar radiation. On the other hand, power-time graph in Fig. 9.19b also
</p>
<p>shows that IC algorithm is more successful at tracking MPP. Total energy data
</p>
<p>acquired from the power analyzer that are given in Table 9.6 also proves it.
</p>
<p>Percentage of energy differences in Table 9.7 indicates that efficiency of IC algo-

<p>In Fig. 9.19c, power output result of OC and P&amp;O algorithms are depicted. This
</p>
<p>time P&amp;O algorithm is more successful at tracking MPP. Total energy data in
</p>
<p>Table 9.6 which is acquired from the power analyzer also verifies this inference.
</p>
<p>Delta energy data in Table 9.7 reveals that P&amp;O algorithm has 5.284% more total
</p>
<p>efficiency as compared to OC algorithm.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 9.19d, power output result of winners of first and second comparisons are
</p>
<p>depicted. As depicted in Fig. 9.19d P&amp;O algorithm is less successful than IC
</p>
<p>algorithm at finding MPP. It is also stated in Tables 9.6 and 9.7 with total energy
</p>
<p>data and energy differences data respectively. IC algorithm is more successful than
</p>
<p>P&amp;O algorithm.
</p>
<p>The test results show that IC algorithm is the most successful maximum power
</p>
<p>point tracker algorithm under fast altering solar irradiation. However this perfor-
</p>
<p>mance is not based on success of IC algorithm at radiation fluctuation. This situ-
</p>
<p>ation is detected from energy differences data in Table 9.7. Although radiation
</p>
<p>variation values increased at every section, delta energy is not increasing regularly
</p>
<p>with each section. With presence of these results, it is not possible to show that IC
</p>
<p>algorithm is more adaptive to variation of irradiance than P&amp;O and OC algorithms.
</p>
<p>Besides it can be claimed that IC algorithm is the most successful one between three
</p>
<p>algorithms at tracking MPP also in the case quick variations at irradiation.

<p>and a data logger. The analyzed data are recorded between 10 Oct. 2013 and 30
</p>
<p>Oct. 2013 for 20 days. The variation of solar radiation on the location is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.21.
</p>
<p>Current and voltage values of PV panels are recorded for duration of a minute.
</p>
<p>Output voltage and current values of two panels are shown in Fig. 9.22. Vmppt and
</p>
<p>Imppt define output voltage and current of PV2, Vhybrid and Ihybrid identify output

<p>radiation is minimum. Output voltage of PV2 increases up to 45 V when the
</p>
<p>radiation is maximum whereas maximum output voltage of PV1 stays under 30 V.
</p>
<p>If the current variations are examined, although PV1 gives higher current than
</p>
<p>PV2, similar characteristics can be seen in both systems. In the days between 9th
</p>
<p>and 15th that solar radiation is maximum in, output current of PV2 is minimum
</p>
<p>since Controller 2 monitors and controls the DC bus voltage to prevent the voltage
</p>
<p>exceed 27.8 V.
</p>
<p>Output power variations of panels are shown in Fig. 9.23. The output power
</p>
<p>characteristic varies in proportion to solar radiation as seen in Fig. 9.23. Operation
</p>
<p>characteristic of PV2 panel group controlled by Controller 2 depending on DC bus
</p>
<p>voltage can be seen clearly in the Fig. 9.23.
</p>
<p>Since DC bus voltage reaches to maximum value between 9th and 15th days,
</p>
<p>Controller 2 restricts the related panel output power. This feature contributes to
</p>
<p>system stability. In the same time interval, there is no limitation in other panel
</p>
<p>output power. Although Fig. 9.23 creates perception that the generated power by
</p>
<p>PV1 is higher than PV2, the total energy obtained from PV1 is 39,826 kWh
</p>
<p>whereas PV2 is 45,366 kWh in the measurement interval. The energy generated
</p>
<p>from PV2 is higher by 16.81% from PV1.

<p>The power difference between two panel groups is caused by Controller 2 that
</p>
<p>always provides maximum power point operating. While output power of PV1
</p>
<p>oscillates in high range, there is stable output power in PV2. It clearly seen from
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.23a that DC bus voltage is higher than 27.8 V between the days 9th and 14th.

<p>Abstract Photovoltaic modules have nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics.
</p>
<p>Thus, output power of the photovoltaic module varies with module specification and
</p>
<p>its operation point. It means that, the photovoltaic system generates maximum power
</p>
<p>at a single operation point for an environmental condition such as the irradiation level
</p>
<p>and angle, ambient temperature level etc. In addition, energy conversion efficiency
</p>
<p>varies with load level and operation point of the photovoltaic system. Since these
</p>
<p>parameters are variable, operation point of the photovoltaic system should be con-
</p>
<p>trolled to get maximum output power and maximum energy conversion efficiency.
</p>
<p>This action is called as maximum power point tracking. The maximum power point
</p>
<p>tracking action is usually performed with a power electronics converter. A number of
</p>
<p>maximumpower point trackingmethods have been introduced to obtain fast response,
</p>
<p>especially in rapidly-changing atmospheric conditions, low oscillation and higher
</p>
<p>energy conversion efficiency values. However, most of thesemethods are effective for
</p>
<p>uniform solar irradiation conditions. If the solar irradiation is non-uniform, the
</p>
<p>power-voltage (P-V) curve of the photovoltaic module or array has multiple peak
</p>
<p>points: Several local maximum power points and one global maximum point. In this
</p>
<p>case, traditional maximum power point tracking methods determine the nearest peak
</p>
<p>power point, which may be a local maximum point. Thus, some improved maximum
</p>
<p>power point tracking methods have been proposed to determine the global maximum
</p>
<p>power point of the photovoltaic system even under partial shading conditions.
</p>
<p>A discussion on different maximum power point tracking methods for the solution of
</p>
<p>these problems will be given and themost powerful techniques in the literature will be
</p>
<p>outlined.

<p>10.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The increasing word power demand, limitation of the conventional energy sources
</p>
<p>and increasing environmental concerns increase the number of the studies on
</p>
<p>renewable energy sources. As a result of these studies, photovoltaic (PV) systems
</p>
<p>which are safe, modular, clean, inexhaustible, maintenance free and nearly reach-
</p>
<p>able in all over the word have gained importance. Their modular structure, long
</p>
<p>lifetime, decreasing cost and recent advancements in static power conversion
</p>
<p>technologies allows implementing PV systems from a few Watts to MW power
</p>
<p>level. Because power level of the PV module is limited, numbers of modules are
</p>
<p>connected in series and parallel to obtain the high power levels [1&ndash;5].
</p>
<p>The power generated by PV modules is depend on the module specifications,
</p>
<p>environmental issues such as pollution and temperature and solar irradiation level.
</p>
<p>So, the output power varies with operation conditions and this may reduce the
</p>
<p>module energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, maximum power point tracking
</p>
<p>(MPPT) methods are used to change the operation condition according to these
</p>
<p>effects to obtain maximum energy conversion efficiency. The perturb and observe
</p>
<p>(P&amp;O) method, the incremental conductance (IC) method, the constant voltage
</p>
<p>(CV) method, the constant current (CC) method, the pilot cell (PC) method, the
</p>
<p>262 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ripple correlation control (RCC) method, the current sweep technique (CST), the
</p>
<p>parasitic capacitance method are the well-known MPPT methods. These methods
</p>
<p>have different specifications in complexity, convergence speed, module depen-
</p>
<p>dency, and track the maximum power point (MPP) of the PV system under uniform
</p>
<p>insolation condition where only one peak point exists in the P-V curve [2&ndash;5].
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many factors that affect the operation of each module
</p>
<p>and generate differences on the module characteristics. In this condition, multiple
</p>
<p>peaks may appear in P-V curve of PV system. The conventional circuit models of
</p>
<p>PV modules are changed because of passing clouds, manufacturing tolerances, dirt,
</p>
<p>aging, soldering errors or micro cracks which occur during production, trans-
</p>
<p>portation or installation periods, and this cause degradation of PV system perfor-
</p>
<p>mance [6]. This effect results an extra heat on PV module and may cause localized
</p>
<p>hot spot. A bypass diode is connected in parallel with each PV module to overcome
</p>
<p>these negative effects [7]. Especially non-uniform insolation of PV system because
</p>
<p>of passing clouds or another cause of shadow has great effect on system perfor-
</p>
<p>mance. The preventive methods can be grouped into three categories as
</p>
<p>(1) Modification of power converter topologies and their interconnections,
</p>
<p>(2) Modifying of the PV module connection (or generating dynamic connection
</p>
<p>patterns), (3) Modifying the MPPT algorithm in order to obtain maximum power
</p>
<p>even in multiple peak power points [6].
</p>
<p>Characteristics of the shaded module will be different from the other ones under
</p>
<p>partially shading condition (PSC). So, using separate converter for each module
</p>
<p>seems as an effective way to prevent the negative effects of this condition. Thus, the
</p>
<p>power converter topologies are changed from centralized converters to string
</p>
<p>converters or to module integrated converters [6]. Also different connection patterns
</p>
<p>are investigated to mitigate the partial shading effects because performance
</p>
<p>degradation rate is not depending on shading area but depends on shading pattern,
</p>
<p>configuration of the array and location of the shaded module in the array []. In
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.1, P-V curve examples of a PV array for uniform and non-uniform inso-
</p>
<p>lation conditions are depicted [7]. As it is seen from the figure, the P-V curve can
</p>
<p>differ significantly. In addition, reconfiguration methods those dynamically change
</p>
<p>the array configuration with active switches have been proposed to adapt the PV
</p>

<p>system different PSCs. But these methods increase the system cost and complexity
</p>
<p>[8, 9].
</p>
<p>Since the P-V curve of the PV system has multiple peaks with several local
</p>
<p>peaks (LPs) and a global peak (GP), the MPPT action is more complicated under
</p>
<p>PSCs. Conventional MPPT methods such as P&amp;O and IC likely detect one of the
</p>
<p>LPs and oscillate around the vicinity of this LP. So, these methods cannot track the
</p>
<p>global MPP of partially shaded PV system. This may cause relevant energy loss.
</p>
<p>These issue has investigated lately, because the initial PV applications are usually
</p>
<p>rooftop and in rural areas [10]. Thus, enhanced MPPT methods have been inves-
</p>
<p>tigated to improve the performance of the PV system under PSCs with the
</p>
<p>increasing usage and power levels of PV systems. Initial studies on MPPT methods
</p>
<p>under PSCs are usually based on modification of the conventional methods. But
</p>
<p>with advancements of the microcontroller and their computational capability new
</p>
<p>methods based on soft computing have also been investigated. Although main
</p>
<p>objective of these methods and the conventional MPPT methods are same, they
</p>
<p>have different specifications in terms of complexity, convergence speed, calculation
</p>
<p>effort, flexibility, steady state oscillation and etc.
</p>
<p>10.2 Characteristics of Partially Shaded PV Module
</p>
<p>Output electrical parameters of photovoltaic modules exhibit nonlinear behavior.
</p>
<p>Several PV cell equivalent circuit models are presented in the past literature.
</p>
<p>Generally, the model called as double-diode model and one-diode model (which is
</p>
<p>also called or five parameters model) are used [11, 12]. The one-diode model is
</p>
<p>obtained from a reduction of double-diode model. Also, simpler equivalent circuits
</p>
<p>are obtained by assuming that the equivalent series resistor of cell (Rs) is zero and
</p>
<p>parallel equivalent resistor of cell (Rp) is infinity. The equivalent circuit of one
</p>
<p>diode model is given in Figure &ldquo;One-diode equivalent circuit of PV cell&rdquo; (shown in
</p>
<p>other chapter of this book).
</p>
<p>Two-diode model which is one of the common PV equivalent circuit models is
</p>
<p>obtained by adding second parallel diode to the model. The two-diode model
</p>
<p>provides more accurate V-I characteristics than one-diode model. In one diode
</p>
<p>model, the ideality factor A is assumed as constant. However, A is a function of
</p>
<p>voltage and its value is closer to one at high voltage levels approaches two at lower
</p>
<p>voltage. The junction recombination is modeled by adding a second diode in par-
</p>
<p>allel with the first diode. This PV cell model is shown in Figure &ldquo;Two-diode
</p>
<p>equivalent circuit of PV cell&rdquo; (shown in other chapter of this book). Equations for
</p>
<p>the output current of the PV cell are also given in another chapter of this book for
</p>
<p>one-diode and two-diode equivalent circuits.
</p>
<p>The output current of a PV cell has nonlinear characteristics. This results a
</p>
<p>nonlinear relation between the PV voltage and PV current and also between PV
</p>
<p>voltage and PV power. In addition, this relation is affected from operation condi-
</p>
<p>tions and environmental effects such as solar irradiation, ambient temperature,
</p>
<p>264 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>pollution etc. The PV module current and power curve versus module voltage is
</p>
<p>given Fig. 10.2a. The module voltage, current and power variations for different
</p>
<p>solar radiation levels are given Fig. 10.2b. As it is seen from the figure, each solar
</p>
<p>irradiation value defines new P-V and I-V curves. Therefore, the operation point of
</p>
<p>the PV system has to be changed with the environmental effects to track the
</p>
<p>maximum power points of each curve and to obtain maximum efficiency.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, PV system may generate lower power than it can.
</p>
<p>All curves in Fig. 10.2 are produced for ideal conditions. However, generally
</p>
<p>this is not valid all the time. Practically, it observed that dirtiness, shadow, unequal
</p>
<p>module specifications, aging of modules and usage of the by-pass diodes increase
</p>
<p>the nonlinearity and affect these curves [13, 14].
</p>
<p>10.2.1 Hot Spot and Partial Shading Effect
</p>
<p>Hot spot effect can be defined as occurring high temperature in any place of
</p>
<p>module. Shading, pollution, transportation damage, cracks during the installation
</p>
<p>and wrong soldering are the most important reasons of hot spot. The hot spot effect
</p>
<p>reduces the efficiency of the PV module and also if it goes on for a long time, it can
</p>
<p>shorten the life of the module. Moreover, PV modules can be out of order because
</p>
<p>of this effect [15].
</p>
<p>Any size of PV installations from low power rooftop systems to high power PV
</p>
<p>power plant can meet partially or fully shading effect. PV modules and connections
</p>
<p>should be checked for maintenance purpose and some parameters should be
</p>
<p>monitored for early intervention. Thus, early aging and hot spot effects can be
</p>
<p>minimized and energy production can be maximized.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When the PV modules run into partially shading effects, they perform different
</p>
<p>output functions depending on module connections and shading formation. The
</p>
<p>shadowed cells in a serial, parallel or serial-parallel mixed connection stop the
</p>
<p>energy generating source operation and operate like an energy consuming load.
</p>
<p>This is the main reason of this variation on output function. The PV system contains
</p>
<p>series or parallel connected modules to reach high power levels. Thus above
</p>
<p>described process may be encountered any time in a day. The shadowed cell gets
</p>
<p>reverse bias and starts to draw current. Namely, shadowed cell does not produce
</p>
<p>energy but consume energy produced from the other cells. Then, total amount of
</p>
<p>generated energy is getting down and hot spot occurs around the reverse biased
</p>
<p>cells. This condition is depicted for serial connected PV modules in Fig. 10.3 [16].
</p>
<p>Therefore, in a PV system which consists of several PV cell and modules
</p>
<p>connected in serial, parallel or serial-parallel to increase voltage and/or current
</p>
<p>levels, the P-V curve of entire PV system becomes different from ideal P-V curve
</p>
<p>which is given in Fig. 10.2a. The resultant P-V curve can be changed according to
</p>
<p>the module connection type and situation of the shaded module or modules. The
</p>
<p>partial shading effect on P-V curve is depicted in Figs. 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6 for
</p>
<p>serial, parallel and serial parallel mixed connection conditions, respectively [12].
</p>
<p>Here, UR and PSC indicate the uniform insolation and the PSC, respectively.
</p>
<p>The decrease in energy generation because of the partial shading is not only
</p>
<p>related with the size of shaded area (or number of shaded modules) but also it is
</p>
<p>related with the shaded pattern and situation of shaded PV modules and their
</p>
<p>connection. Therefore, configuration of the PV system such as numbers of serial
</p>
<p>and parallel connected modules has significant effect on performance of the PV
</p>
<p>system under PSCs. So, some connection strategies are investigated to reduce
</p>
<p>negative effects of the partial shading such as bridge link, total cross tied,
</p>
<p>honey-comb structures, etc. [17].
</p>
<p>Commercially available PV modules contain one or more parallel connected
</p>
<p>by-pass diodes to protect the modules from the negative voltages caused by partial
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.3 Shading effect of the serial connected PV modules
</p>
<p>266 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>shading and so prevent hot spot effects. The effect of the connected by-pass diode
</p>
<p>on PV module and serial connected cell string is depicted in Fig. 10.7 [18, 19].
</p>
<p>As well as by-pass diodes, blocking diodes are also used between photovoltaic
</p>
<p>module strings. These diodes protect the modules from reverse power flow between
</p>
<p>strings. However, both bypass and blocking diodes cause power loses and increase the
</p>
<p>system cost and nonlinearity of the string behavior. Although, using by-pass diodes is
</p>
<p>a well-known protection method, some active structures like power converters are
</p>
<p>also studied in the recent years instead of these by-pass diodes [13, 14].
</p>
<p>While objects with high volume such as building, tree, chimney and etc. cause
</p>
<p>partial shading, objects with low volume like pipe, wire, cable, rope can also cause
</p>
<p>partial shading of the PV. However, there is no direct relation between shadowed
</p>
<p>area of modules and degradation of efficiency. Therefore, degradation amount of
</p>
<p>efficiency can be more than the amount of shadowed area. Namely, a wire or a pipe
</p>
<p>based shadow can cause dramatic degradation on efficiency [20]. Cloudy or shaded
</p>
<p>operating conditions cause degradation of produced energy up to 70% even in the
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>power plants [21]. Moreover, if the reason of whole or partial shading is a moving
</p>
<p>object then, degradation of energy production can be dynamic [22].
</p>
<p>The conventional equations given for the PV cell can be easily extended for a
</p>
<p>PV array. The PV modules are composed of serial, parallel and serial parallel mixed
</p>
<p>connected cells. Although several connection possibilities exist to form the arrays,
</p>
<p>serial, parallel and serial parallel mixed connected modules are usually used in
</p>
<p>arrays. The superposition can be applied them to obtain the equations for a module
</p>
<p>or an array [21]. If subscript M represents the module, NSM and NPM show the
</p>
<p>number of serial connected modules and parallel connected modules, respectively.
</p>
<p>The total number of modules can be written as NSM x NPM for an array. While the
</p>
<p>PV array voltage is related with number of serial connected modules, the array
</p>
<p>current is related with number of parallel connected module strings. Thus, current of
</p>
<p>the array with NSM x NPM serial-parallel connected modules can be written as [21]:
</p>
<p>IA &frac14; NPM � IscM �

</p>
<p>junction temperature, RSA is the equivalent series resistance of the array, VA is the
</p>
<p>array voltage, VocA is open circuit voltage of the array, Ns is number of the serial
</p>
<p>connected cells in modules. The Eq. 10.1 is valid for only uniform insolation
</p>
<p>conditions and it should be revised for non-uniform insolation conditions such as
</p>
<p>partial shading. The current equation can be written for array, which is composed of

</p>
<p>10.3 Maximum Power Point Tracking Under Partially
</p>
<p>Shading Conditions
</p>
<p>Since the P-V curve of the PV array has multiple peak points, the conventional
</p>
<p>MPPT methods which usually use hill climbing method or are usually based on
</p>
<p>slope of the P-V curve may detect one of the local MPPs instead of the global
</p>
<p>MPP. This causes considerable energy losses, which is very important for today&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>energy markets and also for investors. So, a requirement of MPPT algorithms which
</p>
<p>can track the MPP of PV array even under PSCs is come out.
</p>
<p>The PV inverters are used to export the energy generated by PV system to the
</p>
<p>grid and can be grouped into two categories such as single-stage PV inverter and
</p>
<p>two-stage PV inverter as shown in Fig. 10.8a, b, respectively. The main difference
</p>
<p>between these inverter topologies are the number of the power converter stages.
</p>
<p>Two-stage PV inverters exist a DC-DC converter and a DC-AC inverter. While the
</p>
<p>DC-DC converter regulates the DC voltage and performs the MPPT, the inverter
</p>
<p>converters DC to AC, regulates the AC voltage and/or current and exports the PV
</p>
<p>supplied energy to the loads or to the grid. In single-stage inverters, only an inverter
</p>
<p>exists and performs all required actions. The MPPT part is one of the key com-
</p>
<p>ponents of the PV inverter, because it determines the inverter reference current
</p>
<p>value and therefore inverter output power. Here, The MPPT method determines the
</p>
<p>global MPP of the PV system by using some variables such as actual PV voltage
</p>
<p>(V), actual PV current (I), short circuit current (Isc), open circuit voltage (Voc), solar
</p>
<p>irradiation level (Ir), temperature (T) and etc. according to the applied method. As
</p>
<p>explained in the previous sections, resultant P-V curve of the PV system is
</p>
<p>dependent on both solar irradiation levels of the each modules and shading pattern.
</p>
<p>Therefore, connection strategies of the PV modules have significant effect on the
</p>
<p>PV system performance and different connection strategies are investigated.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the MPPT methods examined in two categories as hardware based
</p>
<p>MPPT methods and firmware based MPPT methods. The hardware based methods
</p>
<p>include the module connection strategies, decentralization of the PV system. The
</p>
<p>decentralization method recommends connecting smaller strings with less number
</p>
<p>of modules to the grid through their own inverter or even connecting each module
</p>
<p>to the grid through its own module integrated inverter, instead of connecting all
</p>
<p>modules to the grid through the central inverter. The software based methods are the
</p>
<p>algorithms proposed to determine the global MPP under any operation condition.
</p>
<p>The most common software based methods are explained in the following sections.

<p>10.3.1 MPPT Methods for Partially Shaded PV Systems
</p>
<p>In practical applications a number of PV modules are connected in series and
</p>
<p>parallel to obtain the required power level. Therefore, non-uniform insolation
</p>
<p>condition is very common. Because the energy conversion efficiency is very
</p>
<p>important value for PV systems and many MPPT methods which can track the
</p>
<p>global MPP even in PSCs are introduced [23&ndash;41].
</p>
<p>10.3.1.1 Modified P&amp;O Method
</p>
<p>The P&amp;O method is commonly used in MPPT systems because of its major
</p>
<p>advantages such as high tracking speed and simple implementation specifications.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>However, this method is based on hill climbing rule and cannot track the global
</p>
<p>MPP when multiple peaks are occurring in P-V curve of PV system. Thus, some
</p>
<p>modifications have done to extend the advantages of this method to PSCs. After the
</p>
<p>experimental studies, some observations are reported about partially shaded PV
</p>
<p>systems characteristics. It is seen that, the peak points of the P-V curve are still
</p>
<p>about 0.8 � Voc [17, 24]. In addition, while magnitudes of the peak points are in
tendency of increasing before the global MPP and they are in tendency of
</p>
<p>decreasing after the global MPP. Therefore, P&amp;O method is commonly used to
</p>
<p>track the global MPP under PSCs.
</p>
<p>Different modification schemes can be used for MPPT with P&amp;O method under

<p>PSCs. The PV system is started to operate at 0.85 � Voc and the conventional P&amp;O
method is used to track the MPP until a disturbance such as the PSC is detected or
</p>
<p>an interrupt is generated. When the disturbance is detected or a timer interrupts
</p>
<p>which is generated every predetermined time interval (for example 20&ndash;25 s) occurs,
</p>
<p>the partial shading subroutine is activated. This situation is detected by monitoring
</p>
<p>the power variation (DP) value. If the power variation value is higher than the
</p>
<p>predefined critical power (DPcrit) value, this situation is labeled as PSC. The par-
</p>
<p>tially shading subroutine searches the other peak points on the P-V curve. It is also
</p>
<p>known that, voltage difference between the sequential peak points is almost equal to
</p>
<p>80% of the open circuit voltage of the PV module (Voc_module). Therefore, the
</p>
<p>operating voltage value is changed with a voltage variation step (DVx) which is
</p>
<p>smaller than 0.8 � Voc_module. The lower voltage variation value provides higher
possibility of tracking global MPP, but tracking time also increases. The large
</p>
<p>values of DVx increase the risk of missing global MPP while reducing tracking time.
</p>
<p>After this variation is applied, dP/dV slope of P-V curve for this operation point is
</p>
<p>measured. If the slope is positive, the voltage variation action is repeated until
</p>
<p>minimum operation voltage value Vmin is reached. If the slope is negative, this
</p>
<p>means that there is a peak point in vicinity of this operation point and the P&amp;O
</p>
<p>method is activated to detect this peak point.
</p>
<p>The PV power (Pmax_last) and voltage (Vmax_last) values are stored when the first
</p>
<p>peak point is reached and these values are compared with the values obtained at
</p>
<p>next peak point and higher power values is updated. This action is repeated towards
</p>
<p>to left side of the P-V curve until Vmin or a peak point with lower power value is
</p>
<p>reached. If the power value of the peak point is lower than the previous one,
</p>
<p>operation point is slipped to last peak point with highest power value and voltage
</p>
<p>variation action is applied towards to other direction. The dP/dV slope of the P-
</p>
<p>V curve is measured for all voltage variation. The positive slope value represents
</p>
<p>that there is peak point in vicinity of this operation point. This peak value is tracked
</p>
<p>by activating the P&amp;O method. The PV power and voltage values are read, and if
</p>
<p>these values are higher than the Pmax_last and voltage Vmax_last, this operation is
</p>
<p>repeated in same direction. If the obtained power value is lower than the Pmax_last or
</p>
<p>Vmax which is determined as 0.85 � Voc_module, operation point is transferred to
previous peak point [24]. This modified method operates like double Perturb &amp;
</p>
<p>Observe method. It generates relatively big perturbations to track the GMPP in case
</p>

<p>of multiple peaks. However, the proposed modified P&amp;O method may not track the
</p>
<p>GMPP under rapidly changing solar irradiation conditions [25].
</p>
<p>In another study, an alternative P&amp;O method which compares instantaneous
</p>
<p>measured power (Pm(t)) and instantaneous maximum power reference value is
</p>
<p>proposed [26]. The instantaneous measured power is calculated by multiplying
</p>
<p>instantaneous voltage and instantaneous current measurements. The P-V curve is
</p>
<p>divided into two regions. The instantaneous maximum power is related temperature
</p>
<p>and irradiance as Eq. 10.3:
</p>
<p>PMPP&eth;t&THORN; &frac14; PMPP T&eth;t&THORN;;E&eth;t&eth; &THORN;&THORN; &frac14; a&frac12;T&eth;t&THORN;b&eth;E&eth;t&THORN;� &eth;10:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>here, T(t) is temperature value, E(t) is irradiance value, a(t) is temperature factor and
</p>
<p>E(t) is irradiance factor which determines the maximum power current. The tem-
</p>
<p>perature factor is also called as voltage factor. In region I, maximum power point
</p>
<p>current is obtained by reducing the PV array current as given below:
</p>
<p>I&eth;t&THORN; &frac14; Imeas&eth;t&THORN; � DI &eth;10:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>The performance of this method is depending on the DI. In region II, current
</p>
<p>reference is calculated by Eq. 10.5:
</p>
<p>I&eth;t&THORN; &frac14;
Pmeas&eth;t&THORN;
</p>
<p>a&eth;T&THORN;
&eth;10:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>This algorithm is operated until the power error ratio becomes lower than the
</p>
<p>predetermined level:
</p>
<p>Pm&eth;t&THORN; � Pref &eth;t&THORN;
</p>
<p>Pm t � 1&eth; &THORN;
\e &eth;10:6&THORN;
</p>
<p>here, Pm(t) is the instantaneous measured power and Pref (t) is the instantaneous
</p>
<p>maximum power reference. The P&amp;O method is used to estimate a(T). This method
</p>
<p>introduces various new coefficients which complicate the MPPT process to deter-
</p>
<p>mine the global MPP in case of multiple local peak points.
</p>
<p>Another P&amp;O based MPPT method for DC-DC converter operating under PSCs
</p>
<p>is voltage sweep method. In this method, the PV array is changed voltage from its
</p>
<p>maximum value (near to VOC) to a minimum value (near to ISC) periodically [7]. At
</p>
<p>each sampling cycle, the voltage reference and by the way output power of the
</p>
<p>DC-DC converter is increased step by step and operating voltage and current are
</p>
<p>measured and stored. This action is sustained until PV system voltage reaches the
</p>
<p>predetermined minimum PV voltage. After determining the region of global MPP,
</p>
<p>the conventional P&amp;O method is run to achieve operation at the global MPP [10].
</p>
<p>In addition, measuring the voltage of all PV modules is another method. This
</p>
<p>method is based on the observation that the voltages of PV modules receiving
</p>
<p>different irradiances are different [27]. The operation of this method is always start
</p>
<p>272 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>with reference voltage of 0.85 � Voc and calculates the number of PV modules. If
all voltages of PV modules are equal, this means that solar irradiation is uniform
</p>
<p>and system operates with conventional P&amp;O method. When the peak point is
</p>
<p>determined, the system stores the information (voltage and current values) of this
</p>
<p>point. Voltages of the PV modules are checked with a timer program. When voltage
</p>
<p>of a module is different from another, this is defined as PSC and a global MPP
</p>
<p>subroutine is called. This subroutine controls if any PV module voltage is less than
</p>
<p>zero or not. If there is a PV module with voltage less than zero, this means that, last
</p>
<p>peak point is left peak on the P-V curve. In this condition, reference voltage is set to
</p>
<p>0.85 � Voc and then P&amp;O method is used to determine the global MPP. If all PV
modules&rsquo; voltages is higher than zero, this means that, last peak point is right peak
</p>
<p>on the P-V curve. This means that some of PV modules are bypasses and do not
</p>
<p>provide power to the output. In this condition, subroutine classified the PV modules
</p>
<p>into two groups and determines the PV modules with low voltage. Then program
</p>
<p>set the reference voltage to 0.85 � Voc but, in this case number of modules with
lower voltages is not used calculating the array open circuit voltage (Voc). Again
</p>
<p>P&amp;O method is used to track the global MPP [27].
</p>
<p>10.3.1.2 Modified IC Method
</p>
<p>Since there are multiple peak points are observed in the P-V curve of the PV array,
</p>
<p>conventional MPPT methods cannot track the global MPP of the PV system.
</p>
<p>However, some of the conventional methods have been modified to track the
</p>
<p>GMPP even in PSCs [25]. The conventional IC method is used with predetermined
</p>
<p>linear function to track the MPP even in PSCs without any additional circuits [21].
</p>
<p>In this method, PV voltage and current values are evaluated to determine the PSCs
</p>
<p>by using Eqs. 10.7 and 10.8:
</p>
<p>DVPV &frac14; VPV n&frac12; � � VPV n� 1&frac12; �\DVSET &eth;10:7&THORN;

</p>
<p>here DVSET and DISET are predetermined voltage and current values and are defined

<p>according to manufacturer data. After this situation is determined, voltage reference
</p>
<p>of the system is set according to a linear function defined as given below:

<p>The P-V and I-V curves of a PV system for PSC and operation of the modified IC
</p>
<p>method are depicted in Fig. 10.9. As shown in the figure, the MPP of the PV system
</p>
<p>under uniform irradiation is depicted as point A and this point is tracked with
</p>
<p>conventional IC method. When a PSC occurs, operation point is changed to point
</p>
<p>10 Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithms &hellip; 273</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>B, while the real or global MPP is point D. In this condition, the IC method cannot
</p>
<p>track the GMPP and operates in vicinity of point B. The modified IC method check
</p>
<p>the Eqs. 10.7 and 10.8 and when both conditions are satisfied, the operation point is
</p>
<p>changed to point C which is located at lower voltage area via the linear function
</p>
<p>given in Eq. 10.9. When the operation point is reaches the point C, the conventional
</p>
<p>IC method is used again to track the global MPP and to reach the point D. In
</p>
<p>addition, using variable step size in conventional IC method improves the tracking
</p>
<p>performance and efficiency of the system and reduces the loss [21]. Moreover, this
</p>
<p>method is validated only two peaks condition and in case of multiple peak points at
</p>
<p>the left side is not considered.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, conventional IC method is modified with some observations to
</p>
<p>track the MPPT even in PSCs. The critical observations which are also used in
</p>
<p>modified P&amp;O method are:
</p>
<p>&bull; The maximum power points occur at the multiples of 0.8 � Voc which is also
used in modified P&amp;O method is combined.
</p>
<p>&bull; The magnitudes of the peak points increase before the global MPP and decrease
</p>
<p>after the global MPP.
</p>
<p>According to these observations it is obtained that there are three possible options
</p>
<p>for position of global MPP as shown in Fig. 10.10: (a) The global MPP is located
</p>
<p>between the local peak points and local peaks are increasing until the global MPP
</p>
<p>and decreasing after the global MPP, (b) The global MPP is located at left end of the
</p>
<p>P-V curve and (c) The global MPP is located at right end of the P-V curve [25].
</p>
<p>This method requires the Voc voltage value of the PV module and maximum
</p>
<p>number of the serial connected modules (Nmax), and determines the duty cycle value
</p>
<p>of the DC-DC converter. A reduced reference voltage value is determined and the
</p>
<p>operation starts with the conventional IC method. The conventional IC method
</p>
<p>tracks the first MPP that is depicted as peak point A in Fig. 10.10a. The duty cycle
</p>
<p>of the converter and maximum power value for this first MPP is stored. Then the
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>274 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>reference value is changed by adding 0.8 � Voc to the voltage of the first MPP and
operation point of the system is moved to right side of P-V curve (around B in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.10a). The IC method is operated again and second MPP point is tracked.
</p>
<p>The power and duty cycle value at this point is stored. If power value of the second
</p>
<p>MPP is higher than the first MPP and Vmax which is equal to multiply of Voc and
</p>
<p>Nmax is not reached, 0.8 � Voc is added to the previous reference voltage value and
operation point is moved to right side of P-V curve according to observation 2. If
</p>
<p>the next power value is lower than the previous one (for example peak point C in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.10a), the operation point is moved to the previous peak power point which
</p>
<p>is stored, and then the conventional IC method is operated. If the next power value
</p>
<p>is higher than the previous one (for example peak point H in Fig. 10.10c),
</p>
<p>0.8 � Voc is added to the previous reference voltage value and operation point is
moved to right side of P-V curve until the Vmax is reached [25].
</p>
<p>If the power value at the second MPP is lower than power at the first MPP as
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 10.10b and minimum reference voltage is not attained yet, the first
</p>
<p>MPP voltage is reduced by 0.8 � Voc and operation point is moved to left side of
first MPP. The conventional IC method is used again to track the peak point. This
</p>
<p>operation goes on until the minimum reference voltage is attained. A bias value for
</p>
<p>the slope in conventional IC method can be used to prevent the duty cycle variation
</p>
<p>in case of low power variations. Thus the total system efficiency is increased and
</p>
<p>oscillation in steady state is reduced [25].
</p>
<p>10.3.1.3 Dividing Rectangles (DIRECT) Algorithm
</p>
<p>The DIRECT algorithm uses Lipschitz function to describe the power/voltage
</p>
<p>relationship of PV cells and to track the global MPP of the partial shaded PV
</p>
<p>system [28]. Under PSC, connection of PV cells can be re-organized and new
</p>
<p>modules can be obtained with cells with similar irradiation condition. Then, these
</p>
<p>modules can be considered in series and/or parallel connection according to shading
</p>
<p>pattern to constitute a new PV array. Then, the output current (ia) and voltage
</p>
<p>(va) of new configuration can be defined as given below:

<p>Since M bounds the p0&eth;c&THORN;, Eq. 10.16 can be obtained from Eq. 10.15:
</p>
<p>p v1&eth; &THORN; � p v2&eth; &THORN;j j �M v1 � v2j j 8v1; v2 2 a; b&frac12; �: &eth;10:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>Equation 10.16 is known a Lipschitz condition and the function p v&eth; &THORN; which
satisfies this condition with constant M is known as Lipschitz function.
</p>
<p>If v1 is assumed as sampled point and v is a variable, Eq. 10.16 gives both lower
</p>
<p>and upper bounds and values of function p v&eth; &THORN; at other points can be obtained as:

<p>p v1&eth; &THORN; �M v� v1j j � p&eth;v&THORN;� p v1&eth; &THORN;&thorn;M v� v1j j: &eth;10:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>If v1 is assumed at center of a; b&frac12; �, Eq. 10.17 can be rewritten as:

</p>
<p>Thus, bound of the distance from global maximum is observed from sample

<p>276 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(b &minus; a) can be replaced by smaller length of subintervals by using more samples.
</p>
<p>The DIRECT method is proposed to search the global extreme of this Lipschitz
</p>
<p>function in a finite number of iteration [28].
</p>
<p>When a DC-DC converter is used, boundaries of the duty cycle is [0,1]. However,
</p>
<p>this bounded are can be narrowed by using PV parameters such as maximum and
</p>
<p>minimum values of the PV short circuit current, open circuit voltage and equivalent
</p>
<p>resistive load. Under PSC, while there are multiple peaks on P-V curve, I-V curve
</p>
<p>shows multiple steps characteristics. It is assumed that, the PV system is operating at
</p>
<p>its MPP depicted as Dm1 in Fig. 10.11a. If a PSC occurs at this time, operation point
</p>
<p>of the PV system is move from 1 to 2 as shown in Fig. 10.11a.
</p>
<p>This results decrease in output power and energy conversion efficiency of PV
</p>
<p>system. Now, the DIRECT method starts the sampling interval and takes three
</p>
<p>samples Di (i = 1,2,3) to determine operation condition if it is uniform irradiation or
</p>
<p>PSC. Each step of the multistep I-V curve can be considered a part of the I-V curve
</p>
<p>of a PV module under uniform irradiation. Therefore, the I-V can be considered in
</p>
<p>three parts. If Idi and VDi are well separated, means Eqs. 10.19 and 10.20 are
</p>
<p>satisfied, ID1 would be smaller than IMPP3 (MPP current of first step), and VD2
would also bigger than VOC of the middle step [28]:

<p>If the I-V curve has more than three steps, two sequential steps always con-
</p>
<p>sidered as one step. In addition, if the Eq. 10.19 or Eq. 10.20 is not satisfied, one of
</p>
<p>the intervals should be divided into three subintervals and two new samples should
</p>
<p>be taken. DIRECT evaluate the values obtained from these three samples and
</p>
<p>determines the operation condition as uniform irradiation or partial shading.
</p>
<p>If DIRECT determines the PSC, potentially optimal interval (for example jth
</p>
<p>interval) is divided into three subintervals by taking two new samples (Dj2 and Dj3)
</p>
<p>as second iteration. In third and fourth iterations, DIRECT divides other two
</p>
<p>potentially optimal intervals into three subintervals by taking two new samples for
</p>
<p>each potentially optimal interval as depicted in Fig. 10.12. At the end, there are nine
</p>
<p>intervals and DIRECT evaluates the obtained data. In most application this oper-
</p>
<p>ation is enough to determine some samples near the global MPP. If two samples
</p>
<p>that have the highest power values are sequential, the global MPP is in this interval

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and DIRECT moves the operation point to this interval and tracks the global MPP
</p>
<p>by using conventional P&amp;O or IC methods. However, if these two samples are not
</p>
<p>sequential, this means that system has two global MPPs or one local MPP closed to
</p>
<p>global one. In this case DIRECT operates two more cycles and finally obtains 27
</p>
<p>intervals [28].

<p>10.3.1.4 Fuzzy Logic-Based MPPT Method
</p>
<p>The fuzzy logic control (FLC) theory is vagueness and uncertainty based mathe-
</p>
<p>matical discipline and allows one to use non-precise or ill-defined concepts.
</p>
<p>The FLC removes the system&rsquo;s complete mathematical model requirement, but it
</p>
<p>requires prior knowledge about the system to provide proper design. The fuzzy
</p>
<p>logic control has robust performance even under some parameters of the system
</p>
<p>varies or and disturbances occur through its nonlinear and adaptive nature [3, 29,
</p>
<p>30]. The FLC is applied to MPPT of PV system under uniform insolation condi-
</p>
<p>tions and fast tracking speed with reduced oscillation is obtained. The inputs of the
</p>
<p>FLC are usually defined as an error (E) and a change in error (DE), and these are
</p>
<p>calculated as:
</p>
<p>E&eth;k&THORN; &frac14;
P&eth;k&THORN; � P k � 1&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>V&eth;k&THORN; � V k � 1&eth; &THORN;

</p>
<p>Thus, the P&amp;O method is evaluated with fuzzy logic controller with the advance
</p>
<p>of the variable size. Also the IC method can be evaluated by using change in PV
</p>
<p>power and change in PV voltage values as inputs and faster tracking speed and
</p>
<p>lower oscillation around the MPP are obtain with the help of variable step size [3].
</p>
<p>Both two approaches combine the advantages of P&amp;O or IC method such as fast
</p>
<p>response, easy to implement with the adaptive nature of the FLC.
</p>
<p>However, these FLC based MPPT algorithms unable to track the MPP of PV
</p>
<p>system under PSCs because of the complex structure of P-V characteristics of the
</p>
<p>PV system. So some modifications have been done to prevent the MPPT system to
</p>
<p>trap the local MPP. The initial voltage tracking function is introduced for this aim.
</p>
<p>If the PSC is determined, the operation point of the PV system is changed to the
</p>
<p>computed initial voltage, and then the MPPT action is performed. The initial
</p>
<p>voltage tracking function is defined as given below [30]:
</p>
<p>Vinitial &frac14;
VMPP
</p>
<p>IMPP
� I &eth;10:25&THORN;
</p>
<p>where VMPP and IMPP are MPP voltage and current values of PV array, respectively,
</p>
<p>and I is the instantaneous PV current. The VMPP and IMPP values can be obtained

<p>from I-V and P-V characteristics of the PV array operating at standard test condi-
</p>
<p>tions [30].
</p>
<p>In another method, the PV system is scanned and operating power of the PV
</p>
<p>system is stored. Then, these values are used together with the FLC based MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithm to track the global MPP even in PSCs. In this method, the operating area
</p>
<p>of PV system is scanned and obtained maximum power values are stored during the
</p>
<p>initial or changing weather conditions. A preset value representing admissible
</p>
<p>difference between the determined maximum power and operating power is used in
</p>
<p>control rules. If the actual power difference is greater than the pre-set power dif-
</p>
<p>ference value, the duty cycle is increased; otherwise the FLC based MPPT algo-
</p>
<p>rithm is applied. The flowchart of this modified FLC based MPPT method is given
</p>
<p>in Fig. 10.13. This scanning and storing action and control rule prevent the system
</p>
<p>to trap the local MPP.
</p>
<p>Three scanning and storing methods can be performed in this method:
</p>
<p>(i) Initializing system with maximum duty cycle, (ii) Increasing the duty cycle from
</p>
<p>a minimum value to a maximum value with a fixed step, (iii) Applying a large
</p>
<p>initial perturbation step to make a wide search. All three method guarantee to track
</p>
<p>the global MPP under PSCs but their detection speeds are different.

<p>10.3.1.5 Artificial Neural Network Based MPPT Method
</p>
<p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational computer systems which are
</p>
<p>designed to perform the characteristics of the human brain such as learning, pro-
</p>
<p>ducing new knowledge via learning and discovering new knowledge and skills
</p>
<p>automatically without any help. The ANN simulates the biological neural system by
</p>
<p>using artificial neurons instead of biological ones. These neurons are connected to
</p>
<p>each other with different weights to compose the artificial neural network which can
</p>
<p>learn, store in memory and discover the relations between the data.
</p>
<p>The ANN is used to track the MPP of the uniformly insolated PV systems with
</p>
<p>its pattern recognition capability. The PV parameters such as PV voltage and PV
</p>
<p>current or environmental parameters such as temperature and insolation or com-
</p>
<p>bination of these two groups can be used as input parameters for the ANN. The
</p>
<p>VMPP, the IMPP and the converter duty ratio are usually used as outputs. The
</p>
<p>designers should decide parameters about the hidden layers. Design process of the
</p>
<p>ANN is completed after the weights are determined with intricate training stage by
</p>
<p>using the data obtained from simulation or experimental results. Although the ANN
</p>
<p>based MPPT method has some advantages, its performance is depended on the
</p>
<p>technical knowledge and skill of the designers, and PV module characteristics. The
</p>
<p>differences between the commercially available PV module characteristics bring out
</p>
<p>module dependency to performance of this method. In addition, retraining is
</p>
<p>required because of variation of PV characteristics with time, with solar insolation
</p>
<p>or with temperature. Therefore, number of studies on the ANN based MPPT
</p>
<p>method under non-uniform insolation and PSCs is very less because of these
</p>
<p>drawbacks. Instead, the ANN is used together with the other methods to provide
</p>
<p>learning and remembering features.
</p>
<p>The conventional IC method that cannot track the global MPP can be combined
</p>
<p>with ANN to achieve improved performance in these conditions. The IC method is
</p>
<p>usually used together with the CV method to increase the tracking speed. The CV
</p>
<p>method uses the linear relation as given with Eq. 10.26 between the VMPP and VOC:
</p>
<p>VMPP &frac14; K � VOC &eth;10:26&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here K is usually 0.7&ndash;0.8, and this value is related with the module character-
</p>
<p>istics. Thus, the operation point of the PV system transferred to the vicinity of MPP
</p>
<p>with one step, and then the IC method tracks the real MPP with improved tracking
</p>
<p>speed. However, these values are valid for only uniform insolation conditions.
</p>
<p>Under non-uniform insolation conditions, the parameter K can be determined with
</p>
<p>ANN to transfer the PV system to the vicinity of the global MPP and then IC
</p>
<p>method can track the global MPP with fast speed. A feedforward ANN with two
</p>
<p>inputs and one output can be used for this aim. Here, the PV voltage and PV current
</p>
<p>can be used as input signals and the parameter K or directly VMPP can be used as the
</p>
<p>output value. After determining the numbers of the hidden layer and neurons at the
</p>
<p>hidden layer which have significant effect on ANN performance, the training
</p>
<p>process is executed with the training and test values obtained from experimental
</p>
<p>10 Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithms &hellip; 281</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>studies. After the successful training stage, the ANN that can perform nonlinear
</p>
<p>input-output mapping for different operation conditions is obtained. Consequently,
</p>
<p>a method that can perform fast MPPT performance under both uniform and
</p>
<p>non-uniform insolation condition is obtained by combining the ANN and the IC
</p>
<p>method [31].
</p>
<p>Similarly, the ANN and the FLC can be combined to achieve a fast and efficient
</p>
<p>MPPT method which can track the global MPPT even under PSCs. In this topol-
</p>
<p>ogy, while the ANN is determining the voltage reference (that is the required
</p>
<p>operation point), the FLC controls the power converter to transfer the actual
</p>
<p>operation point to the required operation point. Unlike the previous method,
</p>
<p>averaged solar insolation levels of modules and temperature value are used as
</p>
<p>inputs. The modules of the PV system are divided into four groups, and average
</p>
<p>insolation level value of each group is calculated by using Eqs. 10.27&ndash;10.30:
</p>
<p>E1 &frac14; 0:25� EM1 &thorn;EM2 &thorn;EM4 &thorn;EM5&eth; &THORN; &eth;10:27&THORN;
</p>
<p>E2 &frac14; 0:25� EM2 &thorn;EM3 &thorn;EM5 &thorn;EM6&eth; &THORN; &eth;10:28&THORN;
</p>
<p>E3 &frac14; 0:25� EM4 &thorn;EM5 &thorn;EM7 &thorn;EM8&eth; &THORN; &eth;10:29&THORN;
</p>
<p>E4 &frac14; 0:25� EM5 &thorn;EM6 &thorn;EM8 &thorn;EM9&eth; &THORN; &eth;10:30&THORN;
</p>
<p>where EM1-EM9 are the solar insolation level of the PV modules. Thus, the resultant
</p>
<p>P-V curve which is affected from the insolation level of each module and also the
</p>
<p>shading pattern is aimed to model. The output of the ANN is again voltage refer-
</p>
<p>ence. The difference between the voltage reference and the actual PV voltage and
</p>
<p>the integral of this difference are used as input variables of the FLC. The output
</p>
<p>variable of the FLC is duty ratio value of the converter. Thus, different insolation
</p>
<p>levels of the PV modules, in other words shading pattern of the PV system, are
</p>
<p>taken into account by the ANN used in voltage reference determination and the
</p>
<p>operation point is transferred to the determined point via the FLC [32]. The ANN is
</p>
<p>sufficiently accurate in mapping between a partially shaded condition and optimum
</p>
<p>voltage and power of a PV array is obtained by this ANN-FLC combined method.
</p>
<p>10.3.1.6 Particle Swarm Optimization Method
</p>
<p>The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is population based and stochastic search
</p>
<p>technique which is developed by inspiring the behaviors of bird flocks [33&ndash;35].
</p>
<p>This technique is presented for the multi-variable and multi-parameter optimization
</p>
<p>problems and successfully used in solution of nonlinear problems. This technique is
</p>
<p>evolutionary computing method and starts with random solutions which are called
</p>
<p>particles, and then optimum solution is obtained by updating the generations. Next
</p>
<p>directions of the each particle are determined according to its own success and
</p>
<p>282 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>success of the best particle in a neighborhood (Pbest) and success of the best particle
</p>
<p>in the population (Gbest). The position of the particle xi is adjusted by using:
</p>
<p>xi k&thorn; 1&eth; &THORN; &frac14; xi&eth;k&THORN;&thorn; vi k&thorn; 1&eth; &THORN; &eth;10:31&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here vi is the velocity component representing the searching step size and can be
</p>
<p>calculated by
</p>
<p>vi k&thorn; 1&eth; &THORN; &frac14; wvi&eth;k&THORN;&thorn; c1r1 Pbesti � xi&eth;k&THORN;f g&thorn; c2r2 Gbest � xi&eth;k&THORN;f g &eth;10:32&THORN;
</p>
<p>where c1 and c2 are the acceleration coefficients, w is the weight of the inertia, r1,
</p>
<p>r2 2 U(0, 1), Pbesti is the individual best position of particle i, and Gbest is the best
position of the population [33&ndash;35].
</p>
<p>While the PSO based MPPT method can be used to track the global MPP, this
</p>
<p>method can also be used together with one of conventional method such as IC or
</p>
<p>P&amp;O. In this situation, the conventional MPPT method tracks the MPP under
</p>
<p>uniform insolation conditions. When the PSC is detected, the PSO algorithm is
</p>
<p>activated and global MPP is detected even multiple peak points are occurring on P-
</p>
<p>V curve of the PV system.
</p>
<p>Generally, solution vector with Np particles is defined as given below:
</p>
<p>xki &frac14; dg &frac14; d1; d2; d3; d4; . . .::dn&frac12; � and n &frac14; 1; 2; . . .:Np: &eth;10:33&THORN;
</p>
<p>The objective function can be determined as:
</p>
<p>f xki
	 

</p>
<p>[ f Pbesti&eth; &THORN;: &eth;10:34&THORN;
</p>
<p>If the condition given in Eq. 10.34 is satisfied the individual best position Pbesti
is updated using Eq. 10.35:
</p>
<p>Pbesti &frac14; x
k
i : &eth;10:35&THORN;
</p>
<p>The algorithm generates three duty cycle values di (i &frac14; 1; 2; 3) and the opti-
mization process is started and updates these three duty cycle values. After some
</p>
<p>iteration, all three duty cycles reach the MPP of PV system. Owing to the low
</p>
<p>velocity of the duty cycle variation, the MPPT action is obtained without any
</p>
<p>oscillation. In addition, since this MPPT method is not based on the slope or sign
</p>
<p>value of P-V curve of PV system, this method can successfully track the MPPT
</p>
<p>even in PSCs [34].
</p>
<p>However, some problems may appear especially if the small but fast change in
</p>
<p>insolation occurs. In this case, small step sizes decrease the tracking speed of the
</p>
<p>system. In addition, bigger step sizes may cause skipping the global MPP and
</p>
<p>detecting local MPP instead of global MPP. Therefore, conventional PSO algorithm
</p>
<p>should be modified. The modification has two phases. In first one previous duty
</p>
<p>cycles are decreased and increased linearly according to the PV array power by
</p>
<p>10 Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithms &hellip; 283</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>factor K1. In second phase, after the three duty cycles reach the MPP, two of the
</p>
<p>three duty cycles are perturbed extremely in positive and negative directions with a
</p>
<p>constant K2 [34].
</p>
<p>The PSO algorithm can also be used together with conventional methods. In this
</p>
<p>case, if the solar insolation is uniform, the conventional MPPT method activated
</p>
<p>and tracks the MPP of the system. The operation condition of the system is checked
</p>
<p>by using Eqs. 10.19 and 10.20. If these equations are satisfied, this means that
</p>
<p>The PV system operates under PSCs and the PSO algorithm is activated to track the
</p>
<p>global MPP of system [33, 35].
</p>
<p>In this study, the PSO based MPPT method is designed to track the global MPP
</p>
<p>for the PSCs. The number of the particles used in the PSO method is 11. The other
</p>
<p>parameters of the PSO method are c1 = 1.5, c2 = 2.2 and w = 0.3. The commer-
</p>
<p>cially available PV module, SunPower SPR305-WHT, is modeled with
</p>
<p>MATLAB/Simulink and a sample PV system which consists of three strings with
</p>
<p>five serial connected modules is built up. The solar insolation level of the modules
</p>
<p>is changed to test the performance of the designed PSO based MPPT method. The
</p>
<p>P-V curves of the PV system tested for the different insolation conditions and
</p>
<p>determined operation points by the proposed method are depicted in Fig. 10.14. As
</p>
<p>seen from the figure, the proposed scheme, determines the global MPP with great
</p>
<p>performance both in accuracy and speed, and improves the efficiency.
</p>
<p>10.3.1.7 Modified Fibonacci Search Based MPPT Method
</p>
<p>The Fibonacci search method is recursive method that uses the Fibonacci numbers.
</p>
<p>There is limitation about this method that the objective function is to be have only
</p>
<p>single extremum point (single maximum or single minimum point). Therefore, this
</p>
<p>method narrows down the search space and produces subintervals that includes
</p>
<p>single maximum or minimum by using Fibonacci numbers. The searching action
</p>
<p>can be performed in both directions. The values of the objective function at two
</p>
<p>check points (e.g. PV voltage values V1 and V2 in MPPT action) are used to
</p>
<p>determine the direction. The Fibonacci numbers that this method uses can be
</p>
<p>determined with the Eq. 10.36 [36&ndash;38]:
</p>
<p>Fn &frac14; Fn�1 &thorn;Fn�2 for n &frac14; 2; 3; . . .: and F0 &frac14; 0;F1 &frac14; 1 &eth;10:36&THORN;
</p>
<p>As a result, Fibonacci numbers are 0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8 . . .
In this method a variable x and a function f(x) are determined. The PV voltage,
</p>
<p>PV current or duty cycle of the converter may be used as variable x and PV output
</p>
<p>power is used as f(x). Since the main aim is tracking the MPP, a search space should
</p>
<p>be determined as [xmin, xmax] for the variable. At initializing stage two operation
</p>
<p>points (or voltage values), here variables x1 and x2 are determined as depicted in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.15. If f(x1) &lt; f(x2), it means that the MPP should be in interval [x1, xmax] and
</p>
<p>range is shifted to the right as given in Fig. 10.15. In next iteration, x2 becomes x1
</p>
<p>284 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and a new value for x2 is calculated with Fibonacci search formula given in
</p>
<p>Eq. 10.37 [36]:
</p>
<p>x2 &frac14; xmin &thorn;
F n� 1&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>F&eth;n&THORN;
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>� xmax � xmin&eth; &THORN; &eth;10:37&THORN;
</p>
<p>where, F(n) is Fibonacci number. According to Eq. 10.37, the distance between the
</p>
<p>samples is given in Eq. 10.38 and it is seen that the distance becomes narrower in
</p>
<p>each iteration:
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.14 Operation points determined by the PSO based MPPT method for two different
</p>
<p>shading patterns

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ai&thorn; 1 &thorn; bi&thorn; 1 &thorn; ai&thorn; 1 &frac14; ai &thorn; bi &eth;10:38&THORN;
</p>
<p>In the next iteration, if f(x1) &lt; f(x2), again the previous process is performed. If f
</p>
<p>(x2) &lt; f(x1), at that time the search space is limited with x2, so xmax takes the value
</p>
<p>of x2 and this means that the MPP should be in interval [x1, x2] and range is shifted
</p>
<p>to the left. For the next iteration, x1 becomes x2 and a new value for x1 is calculated
</p>
<p>with Eq. 10.39 [36]:
</p>
<p>x1 &frac14; xmax &thorn;
F n� 1&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>F n&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>� xmax � xmin&eth; &THORN; &eth;10:39&THORN;
</p>
<p>In next iteration again f(x1) and f(x2) values are compared. The shifting direction
</p>
<p>is determined according to their values, and new variable values are calculated by
</p>
<p>using Eq. 10.37 or Eq. 10.39 according to the direction. As declared above, the
</p>
<p>distances between the samples are narrowed after each iteration. This process is
</p>
<p>preceded until the MPP is reached [36&ndash;38].
</p>
<p>10.3.1.8 Ant Colony Optimization Based MPPT
</p>
<p>The ant colony algorithm (ACO) is a population based probabilistic algorithm for
</p>
<p>finding optimal paths. This method uses the behavior of ants searching for food and
</p>
<p>is used to solve difficult optimization problems [39]. In MPPT applications, the PV
</p>
<p>array output power can be selected as the fitness function. After the initializing step,
</p>
<p>the PV array power (here fitness value) is calculated for all the newly generated
</p>
<p>particles in the current generation. Then, all fitness values of the newly generated
</p>
<p>particles and the particles in the archive are ranked in ascending order. The archive
</p>
<p>is updated with K best results. The particles in this generation are updated and
</p>
<p>particles for the next generation are generated. This process is repeated until
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.15 Modified Fibonacci search algorithm based MPPT method
</p>
<p>286 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>reaching the maximum iteration number or termination condition. Here, the ter-
</p>
<p>mination condition is reaching MPP of the PV system [39].
</p>
<p>One of the major concerns of using ACO is algorithm speed. This is directly
</p>
<p>related with the tracking speed. The conventional MPPT methods such as P&amp;O or
</p>
<p>IC method can be used to determine the first and the last local MPPs. Thus, these
</p>
<p>values are used as boundary of the searching space and the solution space is
</p>
<p>narrowed. Consequently, tracking speed is improved [39].
</p>
<p>Other evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, differential evo-
</p>
<p>lution algorithm are also used for MPPT of PV systems under PSCs. These systems
</p>
<p>can also be used together with the other methods to optimize the system parameters
</p>
<p>[39&ndash;41].
</p>
<p>10.4 Comparison of Global MPPT Methods
</p>
<p>As it is declared that, the PSC has great effect on PV system performance. After
</p>
<p>tests, it is obtained that power loss occurred at PV system as a results of partial
</p>
<p>shading can be high as 70% [24]. Therefore, the MPPT algorithm for partially
</p>
<p>shaded systems has gain importance and many algorithms have been investigated to
</p>
<p>improve the PV system performance. Initial studies are based on the modification of
</p>
<p>the commonly used MPPT methods like P&amp;O and IC methods which are effective
</p>
<p>for uniform insolation conditions with their advantages such as ease implementation
</p>
<p>and fast tracking speed. So, a search algorithm is combined with conventional
</p>
<p>MPPT methods to overcome the disadvantage of getting trapped at local peak of P-
</p>
<p>V curve. This search algorithm may search the whole P-V curve periodically to
</p>
<p>detect the global MPP. This requires long time and cause reduction on generated
</p>
<p>power.
</p>
<p>The DIRECT method is proposed to decrease the required search time and
</p>
<p>prevent the energy deduction. However, in some partially shading cases, this
</p>
<p>method cannot convergence to the global MPP in a few steps and therefore scan-
</p>
<p>ning time may be as long as ordinary search algorithm. The open circuit voltage or
</p>
<p>short circuit current of the PV module is also used to shorten the search time. Since
</p>
<p>this method is required the knowledge of PV module, the module dependency is
</p>
<p>come out. Besides, a declination on the PV module characteristics because of aging
</p>
<p>effect reduces the efficiency of this method. Although the line search algorithm with
</p>
<p>Fibonacci search has been used for tracking global MPP of partial shaded PV
</p>
<p>systems, this method does not guarantee converging to the global MPP for any
</p>
<p>PSCs. Similar to the conventional P&amp;O or IC methods, the conventional
</p>
<p>extremum-seeking based MPPT method also is trapped at a local peak and therefore
</p>
<p>this cannot track the global MPP under PSCs. Thus, sequential extremum-seeking
</p>
<p>based MPPT method is investigated. This method can track the global MPP and
</p>
<p>eliminate the power ripple around MPP, but its convergence time is high because of
</p>
<p>the global scan requirement [42]. However, this method has some drawbacks such
</p>
<p>as high implementation difficulty, noise sensitivity [43]. In addition, global
</p>
<p>10 Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithms &hellip; 287</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>perturbed-based extremum-seeking control method based on two band pass filters is
</p>
<p>also proposed to track the global MPP of partial shaded PV system. This topology
</p>
<p>reduces the noise sensitivities of band pass filter and improves the tracking per-
</p>
<p>formance and speed [44].
</p>
<p>In addition, artificial intelligence based methods such as FLC, PSO and ANN are
</p>
<p>also used to track the global MPP of partially shaded PV system [45]. The FLC has
</p>
<p>advantages of eliminating the mathematical model requirement, handling nonlin-
</p>
<p>earities and uncertainties and having adaptive nature. However, the conventional
</p>
<p>FLC method cannot guarantee to convergence to global MPP in PSCs. So modified
</p>
<p>FLC based MPPT methods have been implemented to increase the tracking speed
</p>
<p>and therefore efficiency of the PV system. The PSO is an optimization technique
</p>
<p>that models the behavior of bird flocks. The PSO uses a collection of particles to
</p>
<p>find the optimal solution for the problem. However, the PSO is used for
</p>
<p>time-invariant problems. Since the environmental conditions such as solar insola-
</p>
<p>tion and temperature vary with time, a detection and re-initialization procedures
</p>
<p>should be included in the PSO to re-initialize the system when a variation on
</p>
<p>environmental conditions is detected. The PSO with this specification has superior
</p>
<p>advantages such as tracking global MPP effectively in all insolation conditions, fast
</p>
<p>convergence speed and simple structure. However, initial particle positions affect
</p>
<p>the performance of PSO based MPPT method, and improper values may cause
</p>
<p>converging to a local MPP. The ANN methods are also used to track the global
</p>
<p>MPP [7, 45]. Although different neural network structures have different advantages
</p>
<p>and disadvantages, proper trained ANN based MPPT method can track the global
</p>
<p>MPP under any PSC. However, this method requires significant computational
</p>
<p>effort for training the ANN and also is model dependent. The main specifications of
</p>
<p>these methods are summarized in Table 10.1.
</p>
<p>The ACO is another soft computing method based on the swarm intelligence. It
</p>
<p>has superior advantage as adapting its parameters according to changing environ-
</p>
<p>mental conditions. However, it is difficult to implement this topology with low cost
</p>
<p>microcontroller because of the great computational effort requirement. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the convergence speed of this method is relatively low and this drawback limits its
</p>
<p>applications. In addition, this method can be combined with another conventional
</p>
<p>method such as P&amp;O or IC to narrow the search space and to improve the con-
</p>
<p>vergence speed especially for rapidly changing atmospheric conditions [39].
</p>
<p>The chaos search method is stochastic search method which is based on chaos
</p>
<p>theory. This technique generates knowledge and variables by using past experiences.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is superior to other techniques which use random variables. Although,
</p>
<p>this method has features to track the global MPP even under PSCs, number of studies
</p>
<p>are very limited and its performance has not been validated yet [43].
</p>
<p>The Tabu search method is an iterative search algorithm and can be used to track
</p>
<p>the global MPPT of the partial shaded PV applications. This algorithm uses the
</p>
<p>previous data to prevent the staying at the local MPP. However, similar to the chaos
</p>
<p>search method, number of the studies on global MPPT application of the Tabu
</p>
<p>search method is also limited. The cuckoo search method is another search method
</p>
<p>which becomes popular recently. This method uses the brood parasitism of the
</p>
<p>288 I. Sefa et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>cuckoo birds and presents superior performance on global optimization problems.
</p>
<p>This method is has only two parameters to tune, therefore it is simpler than the
</p>
<p>genetic algorithm and PSO method which have three parameters. The Levy flight is
</p>
<p>used in this method to determine the next step. Thus, short steps, long steps or short
</p>
<p>distance jumps can be determined as next step [43]. This method is used to track the
</p>
<p>global MPP with these features and provides fast and accurate performance. The
</p>
<p>differential evolution is another evolutionary algorithm and it can be used to track
</p>
<p>the global MPP of the partial shaded PV system. This method is an independent
</p>
<p>method but it has same disadvantages with the ACO based MPPT [39].
</p>
<p>10.5 Conclusions
</p>
<p>Obtaining maximum available power from PV system is very important. Therefore,
</p>
<p>high efficient power electronic converters, solar tracking systems and MPPT
</p>
<p>methods have been investigated to improve the efficiency of the PV system.
</p>
<p>Although various MPPT methods have been implemented and considerable results
</p>
<p>are obtained for uniform solar insolation conditions, these methods are not useful
</p>
<p>for PSCs. When the PV system does not receive uniform solar insolation, the
</p>
<p>resultant P-V characteristics of the entire PV system becomes more complex and
</p>
<p>have multiple peak points on it. Therefore, tracking the global maximum point of
</p>
<p>the P-V curve becomes more complicated and improved MPPT methods are

<p>required. Following observations about the partial shaded PV system characteristics
</p>
<p>should be taken account while investigating maximum power point search algo-
</p>
<p>rithm to improve the partially shaded PV system efficiency [24, 27]:
</p>
<p>&bull; Under PSCs, the P-V curve of PV system has multiple peak points while I-
</p>
<p>V curve of the system has multiple steps.
</p>
<p>&bull; The maximum PV power value and the PV voltage value that it occurs are not
</p>
<p>only dependent on solar insolation and ambient temperature level but also on the
</p>
<p>shading pattern and array configuration.
</p>
<p>&bull; The global MPP of P-V curve of PV system may lie on the left side of the load
</p>
<p>line. Therefore, the two stage technique will not be able to track the global MPP
</p>
<p>of PV system.
</p>
<p>&bull; The peak points on the P-V curve of the array occur nearly at multiples of 80%
</p>
<p>of module open circuit voltage.
</p>
<p>&bull; Therefore, the minimum displacement (voltage difference) between any two
</p>
<p>consecutive peak power points is nearly 80% of module open circuit voltage.
</p>
<p>&bull; After extensive study of P-V curves, it is reported that when the P-V curve is
</p>
<p>traversed from either side, the magnitude of the peak points increases. After
</p>
<p>reaching the global peak point, the magnitude of the consecutive peaks (if they
</p>
<p>are present) decreases continuously.

<p>Solar Energy Harvesting in Electro
</p>
<p>Mobility
</p>
<p>Ayta&ccedil; G&ouml;ren
</p>
<p>Abstract Based on the experiences of five solar cars designed and manufactured in
</p>
<p>11 years, participations in establishments of solar charging stations and local solar
</p>
<p>power plant projects, this chapter involves modeling energy harvesting and storing
</p>
<p>parts of solar cars, differences between maximum power point tracker topologies in
</p>
<p>implementations, the structures of brushless direct current motors (BLDCMs) and
</p>
<p>batteries as loads and the similarities of brushless direct current motors; briefly,
</p>
<p>solar energy harvesting for electro mobility. Light weight is one of the keys for
</p>
<p>efficiency in electro mobility. This enforces implementations of new technologies in
</p>
<p>manufacturing light weight electric vehicles. The end of the first section of this
</p>
<p>chapter is about using polymer composites in manufacturing process of solar cars.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if energy harvesting should be separated from the vehicle,
</p>
<p>modular on or off-grid solar charging stations might be an efficient solution and an
</p>
<p>implementation of this type of energy harvesting is presented in the second section
</p>
<p>of this chapter. The last section in this chapter is about hybrid off-grid systems
</p>
<p>which also includes smart solutions. Implementations of this chapter are manu-
</p>
<p>facturing process chassis and body of a solar car using polymer composites, a
</p>
<p>model of an off-grid PV charging station for electric vehicles (EVs) in a campus
</p>
<p>area, electrical units of a solar car for World Solar Challenge.

</p>
<p>11.1.1 Modeling of Semi Flex Silicon Solar Panel
</p>
<p>Equivalent circuit of a PV cell can be simply modeled as a current source in parallel
</p>
<p>with a resistor and a diode those are connected in series with another resistor
</p>
<p>(Fig. 11.1). The output of the current source is directly proportional with the light
</p>
<p>on the cell. The open circuit voltage of the cell is quite different from the cell that is
</p>
<p>connected with the load which is shaped with Rs resistor in the same figure.
</p>
<p>Besides, the temperature effects the output of the cell as well. On the other hand, the
</p>
<p>mathematical model of the cell is defined using the Shockley Diode Equation in
</p>
<p>most of the researches about PVs (Eqs. 11.1 and 11.2) [1&ndash;3]. The parameters in

<p>In Eqs. 11.1 and 11.2, the first one is the simple form of the solar cell which is
</p>
<p>represented by one diode or saturation current whereas the second equation is the
</p>
<p>cell representation with two diodes. Both models can be seen in Fig. 11.1a, b
</p>
<p>respectively.
</p>
<p>Semi flex PV panels are the panels which are flexible in one direction. This
</p>
<p>advantage makes it possible to cover a surface of the solar car whose shape is
</p>
<p>formed using fluid dynamics analysis. On the other hand, the final shape of a solar
</p>
<p>car might be also similar with a tube for some designs. In that case, the solar
</p>
<p>irradiation received by the surface might differ from a flat surface that is perpen-
</p>
<p>dicular to the sun rays and for rough calculations, the average energy generation
</p>

<p>In Fig. 11.2, current-voltage and power-voltage graphs of a PV cell at different

</p>
<p>in fact accidently discovered during photo diode experiments in 1950s. This was a
</p>
<p>discovery of a structure that does not control the current due to light, a structure that

<p>sun levels using optics. This systems are called as concentrators. Since the thickness
</p>
<p>of the body shell and mass are important parameters for solar cars, Fresnel Lenses
</p>
<p>are mostly used for this purpose.
</p>
<p>For modeling the photovoltaic cell in MATLAB, it is common to form a model
</p>
<p>of a current source, that is effected by the parameters of light intensity (radiation)
</p>
<p>and temperature. Considering the one or two diode equations, using the parameters
</p>
<p>in Table 11.1, a more convenient model might be used. Chapter 2 in this book
</p>
<p>gives a detail photovoltaic cell model. Besides, a simple MATLAB model might be
</p>
<p>seen in Fig. 11.3.
</p>
<p>Power generation optimization or finding the maximum point for the power
</p>
<p>generation is based on finding the maximum rectangular area in Fig. 11.2a or
</p>
<p>finding the peak point of the curve depending on the cell temperature and irradiance
</p>
<p>for Fig. 11.2c. The way of doing this is increasing or decreasing the output voltage
</p>
<p>level of a DC/DC converter (please see Fig. 11.7). One of the common techniques
</p>
<p>is to change the output voltage with a little difference and observe the output power
</p>
<p>with the previous output power value (perturb and observe). On the other hand, if
</p>
<p>the source is not just PV, but there are wind turbine(s), water turbine(s) or diesel
</p>
<p>generator in the system, total system output should be optimized due to energy
</p>
<p>efficiency or cost.

<p>11.1.2 Types of Energy Loads for Stationary Solar Powered
</p>
<p>Systems and on Vehicles
</p>
<p>11.1.2.1 Energy Loads for Stationary Solar Powered Systems
</p>
<p>Stand alone photo voltaic (SAPV) systems are the system which have only PV to
</p>
<p>generate electricity and are more implemented systems than hybrid ones because of
</p>
<p>their simplicity in design and implementation. Energy consumption of a house
</p>
<p>differs with the area of the house, the location, the number of the people use the
</p>
<p>house, the characteristic of usage and some other parameters, the energy con-
</p>
<p>sumption of the house should not only be analyzed in details but the analysis should
</p>
<p>also cover the whole year usage. In some countries, like Turkey, the generated
</p>
<p>power can be also sold using the grid. So, it is the initial point to design the system
</p>
<p>if the system will be off-grid (not connected to the grid) or on-grid (connected to the
</p>
<p>grid). If the system is on-grid, it is more like that a huge capacitance is connected to
</p>
<p>the system; but, this time charging the capacitor is selling the energy generated to
</p>
<p>the grid and discharging the capacitor is buying energy from the grid. So, it is
</p>
<p>mostly not reasonable to connect a battery pack to the system. On the other hand, if
</p>
<p>it is an off-grid system, commonly a battery pack that its 80% can be charged by the
</p>
<p>PVs in 5 h mostly convenient in Aegean Region of Turkey. Table 11.2 shows
</p>
<p>energy consumption of some loads. Battery, as a load, modeled in next part of this
</p>
<p>section with different types of batteries.
</p>
<p>If the system is an off-grid SAPV system, to be more efficient, loads are rec-
</p>
<p>ommended to use direct current, since the inverter (the unit converts DC to AC)
</p>
<p>also draws energy. Loads connected to the system are mostly considered as resistive
</p>
<p>loads.
</p>
<p>11.1.2.2 Energy Loads for Solar Powered Mobile Systems

<p>Brushless Direct Current Motor (BLDCM) Model
</p>
<p>The mathematical model of a linear BLDCM is generally related with the
</p>
<p>Lorentz force as in electric motors. Of course, there is a nominal force this time, but
</p>
<p>not a nominal torque.

</p>
<p>can reach 99% [4].

<p>Next step of generation energy comes with a harder engineering problem that is to
</p>
<p>store it. If it is a system that can be connected to grid, it is not needed to consider
</p>
<p>chemical reactions or heat up a mass to store energy; but if it is an off-grid one, the
</p>
<p>energy that is generated needs to be transformed in different forms or capacities.
</p>
<p>Capacity might be a water tank for a PV system that is for irrigation to reduce the
</p>
<p>costs and to increase the system life (see Fig. 11.17a). But, mostly it is the chemical

<p>mostly known rechargeable types of batteries for that purpose [8]. It is very

<p>advantage of high energy density (kWh/kg) values. Lead Acid types of batteries are

<p>used in off-grid SAPV or hybrid systems mostly because of their costs [9, 10].

<p>11.1.3 Energy Needs of Solar Cars
</p>
<p>Efficiencies of PVs for the known researches are between 6 and 46% for NREL [13]
</p>
<p>in year 2015. As for the same laboratory report, the most efficient ones are four
</p>
<p>junction or more GaAs ones whereas the maximum efficiency for Si panels is
</p>
<p>27.6% which are the concentrated ones. As known, the efficiency of solar panel is
</p>
<p>calculated using Eq. 11.15. In this equation, ηPV is the efficiency of the panel, Pm is
</p>
<p>the output power in Wp at standard test conditions (STC) for one square meter of
</p>
<p>area under 1000 (W) of global irradiation at 25 &deg;C and air mass (AM) of 1.5.

<p>On the other hand, in real conditions the cell temperature is not at laboratory
</p>
<p>conditions first of all. And for a vehicle that is travelling with different velocities at
</p>
<p>different weather conditions to different directions, the energy taken from the solar
</p>
<p>array varies. For the first step of being realistic, power can be taken from the solar
</p>
<p>array at a known temperature and global irradiation can be calculated using the
</p>
<p>temperature difference Eq. 11.16. NOCT is the normal operating cell temperature
</p>
<p>whereas the / is the solar irradiance. The difference between the temperature of the
</p>
<p>ambient air temperature (Ta) and the cell (Tc) is [14]:

<p>Energy need of a vehicle is calculated with the assumptions of all mechanisms
</p>
<p>run in ideal tolerances and in design phase it is mostly a prediction using these
</p>
<p>calculations. Unlike internal combustion engine cars, the electric car (EV) has
</p>
<p>highest torque at start and nearly a constant torque through running region.
</p>
<p>Considering the efficiencies of PVs which have the maximum efficiency of 46%
</p>
<p>even for the GaAs panels, for a vehicle which generates its energy from sun, the
</p>
<p>efficiencies and the robustness of the units have great importance. This also means
</p>
<p>nearly zero losses and very efficient systems. Electric motors of solar cars, for
</p>
<p>instance, have the efficiency of over 93% (most efficient 99.7%), the motor drivers
</p>
<p>mostly 99% and there is generally no transmission system.
</p>
<p>Considering the weights and technologies of steel body with internal combustion
</p>
<p>engine vehicles, travelling from place to another place feels like asking a traveler if
</p>
<p>he travels to the place you travel and planning to go to your target city without
</p>
<p>forgetting the cities he will visit. Minimizing energy needs and optimizing energy
</p>
<p>usage starts with minimizing travelling mass and analyzing way of doing. Unlike
</p>
<p>classical concept of mass production cars, fibers whether they are carbon, aramid or
</p>
<p>glass make the polymer composite structure more and more strength, light and
</p>
<p>durable. Mass of a car we use in daily life is approximately 1200 kg whereas a solar
</p>
<p>car with the dimensions of 4.7 m � 1.8 m � 1.1 m 200 kg. This case not only
reduces the energy needed to travel, but also gives a chance to manufacture the
</p>
<p>vehicle form more aerodynamics [15&ndash;18].
</p>
<p>In designing phase of a solar car, the basic equation to calculate the energy needs
</p>
<p>is the Eqs. 11.18 and 11.17 might be used for the energy predicted for a solar car
</p>
<p>race [18, 19]. The parameters are defined in Table 11.3. In Fig. 11.5, the resistances

<p>affect the energy need of a solar car can be seen.

</p>
<p>countries. Today, SCs in races are classified with international motorsport federa-

<p>tions and International Solar Car Federation which was formed in 1991 to give
</p>
<p>support to organizers.
</p>
<p>A solar car is powered by PVs (mostly semi flex) which cover the surface of the
</p>
<p>car. The vehicle is designed with the concept of &lsquo;least energy need to travel&rsquo; (see
</p>
<p>Figs. 11.6 and 11.7). After achieving the DC formed electrical energy from the

<p>Fresnel Lenses to concentrate the light intensity on the PV cell. This case, however
</p>
<p>means an additional weight to the car which makes the optimal energy usage
</p>
<p>problem a little bit more complex.
</p>
<p>Power for a resistor in direct current (DC) is the product of applied voltage and
</p>
<p>the current. So, the most efficient implementation of a solar cell is maximizing the
</p>
<p>area in Fig. 11.7. PV cells are assumed as DC formed constant current generators
</p>
<p>which might be differ in real implementations, but for engineering calculations
</p>
<p>which have tolerances inside, said to be true. With this assumption, the VI curve of
</p>
<p>a cell is a horizontal line starting from ISC then a line like curve falls down to VOC
with a slope which is connected to the first line with a radius simply (Fig. 11.9a).
</p>
<p>However, the output current is affected by the radiance directly and the temperature
</p>
<p>affects the point that the line like curve intersection point with the horizontal line, so
</p>
<p>the open circuit voltage. On the other hand, solar radiation and temperature change
</p>
<p>instantaneously in daytime as might be seen in Fig. 11.10. Maximum power point
</p>
<p>trackers are devices those find the point where the system gets maximum power
</p>
<p>from the photovoltaic.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 11.10, irradiation levels taken by the pyranometer which is mounted on
</p>
<p>the roof of the main solar charging station in Tinaztepe Campus Location of Dokuz
</p>
<p>Eylul University can be seen. These data are used to make the results of calculations
</p>
<p>more real for solar car energy harvesting. This station is one of the stations gen-
</p>
<p>erates the energy need of electric vehicles which are used in Dokuz Eylul

</p>
<p>Consider two points on V-I curve of a PV cell. Output power is the product of
</p>
<p>output voltage and current. The greatest output power can be achieved with the
</p>
<p>maximum area of the rectangle. Knowing that the MPPTs are devices those are

<p>connected between PVs and loads, MPPT is a DC/DC converter which increase or

<p>decrease the output voltage, to have the maximum area for the PV used (please see
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.9a). If the output voltage level of the MPPT is higher than input voltage
</p>
<p>level, it is boost type. If the output voltage level is lower than the input voltage
</p>
<p>level, it is buck type (please see Fig. 11.9b). Energy efficiency improvements using
</p>
<p>different MPPTs and different MPPT algorithms might be found in relevant
</p>
<p>chapters of this book.
</p>
<p>Team Solaris of Dokuz Eyl&uuml;l University (Izmir) is a community of academi-
</p>
<p>cians, young investors and researchers from undergraduate to Ph.D. level, who
</p>
<p>gathered around the idea of designing/creating a car powered by solar energy in
</p>
<p>December 2003. As per date, over two hundred and fifty researchers took part, five
</p>
<p>solar cars and four EVs were designed and manufactured in Solaris Projects. Solaris
</p>
<p>Cars took part in WSC (Australia), ESC (Belgium), MSC (Morocco), Formula G
</p>
<p>(Turkey) and European Electric Vehicle Event (Austria). Just between May 2013
</p>
<p>and November 2016, Team Solaris participated in eight international and five
</p>
<p>national solar car/EV races. Most of the implementations and information told
</p>
<p>about solar cars in this chapter are the technical experiences gained during Solaris
</p>
<p>projects design, manufacturing and challenging race phases.
</p>
<p>Although some cars are still using stationary system type MPPTs for some solar
</p>
<p>car teams, it is common to use special designed boost type DC/DC converters with
</p>
<p>adaptive algorithms and wireless telemetry embedded circuits for this purpose.
</p>
<p>Designing the PV array and battery capacity of a stationary solar power plant is
</p>
<p>mainly a cost optimization problem in engineering with more constant parameters.
</p>
<p>However, designing a solar array and energy storage system for a solar car is more
</p>
<p>complex which includes flow analysis, battery and PV combination calculations,
</p>
<p>energy need and optimization, strength analysis, efficiency analysis and more. The

<p>voltage level itself for example changes the speed of the vehicle whereas torque
</p>
<p>generated by the motor is a result of battery type, parallel branches of the battery
</p>
<p>pack, C rating, racing conditions and regulations of the challenges. Every details
</p>
<p>have to be considered. For instance, if the by-pass diode that is needed for
</p>
<p>bypassing the module that has a shaded cell even has to be a fast, low voltage drop
</p>
<p>type diode in order not to cause a big loss. Or sometimes teams spray water to
</p>
<p>surface of cells in order to decrease the cell temperature. If we consider an area of
</p>
<p>6 m2 is used to be covered with PVs for solar cars, for use of Si cells which have
</p>
<p>approximately 22% efficient, the solar array can generate more than 1300 W
</p>
<p>@1000 W/m2 global radiation @25 &deg;C. However, the cell temperature almost
</p>
<p>never 25 &deg;C, the global radiation level is limited just with laboratory conditions, the
</p>
<p>solar cells are just for a little time interval in daytime perpendicular to sun rays and
</p>
<p>1000 W/m2 is a rare value with limited time interval and affected with weather
</p>
<p>conditions. For an optimist prediction of average 1000 W output for a time interval
</p>
<p>from the solar array, the car itself should be very efficient in means of air flow,
</p>
<p>rolling resistances, the motor, driving unit and the batteries.
</p>
<p>Photovoltaics are sources which the current generated by them changes due to
</p>
<p>incident light intensity. As mentioned before, every unit or every system model
</p>
<p>block on the solar car should be used in maximum efficient regions. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, the load connected to the system changes instantaneous, so the unit which
</p>
<p>simulate the load as maximum for PVs is called as maximum power point tracker
</p>
<p>[24&ndash;26]. This is explained in Fig. 11.9 in previous sections. Commercial product
</p>
<p>MPPTs which are used on stationary systems are also used on some solar cars. This
</p>
<p>case causes inefficiency, because of not only the commercial products are designed
</p>
<p>in run as boost, buck and voltage regulation regions, but also are heavy products
</p>
<p>with unneeded cases. A more common and effective way is to design the MPPT just
</p>
<p>as buck (input voltage is greater than output voltage) or boost type (output voltage is
</p>
<p>greater than input voltage). With the assumption of using the optimal number of
</p>
<p>series and parallel groups of PVs on a solar car, the most efficient type of MPPT
</p>
<p>topology for a solar car mainly the boost type and a common algorithm is
</p>
<p>hill-climbing/P&amp;O (perturbation and observe) [1, 24&ndash;27]. The main disadvantage
</p>
<p>of this technique is the local maximum points that can cause not tracking the real
</p>
<p>maximum point. In Fig. 11.11, simplified electrical diagram of a solar car which
</p>
<p>designed by Team Solaris, might be seen. In this implementation, the cells are
</p>
<p>grouped in three groups. Each group has five MPPTs those are connected in series
</p>
<p>to charge a series of 32 LiPo cells connected also in series. The combination of the
</p>
<p>battery pack, however can be changed to different capacity of LiIon or LiPo cells
</p>
<p>and also the number of series-connected cells. If the values changes, developed
</p>
<p>bi-directional telemetry system and its software is used to change the charging
</p>
<p>voltage. The output voltage level is limited with the efficient test regions for MPPT.
</p>
<p>MPPTs in series can increase the efficiency, especially when some cells are shaded.
</p>
<p>A method of using solar energy more efficient is to rotate the PVs of the solar car
</p>
<p>towards the sun to be sure that the arrival of the sun&rsquo;s rays are as close to per-
</p>
<p>pendicular as possible (see Fig. 11.12). This is very common when the solar car is
</p>
<p>not travelling, but even they are rare, there are also some implementations of using

<p>during the race like a group of sun trackers. In that case, not only the route direction
</p>
<p>and car direction should be good analyzed, but also the energy used to control the
</p>
<p>angle of the panels and the energy generated by the panels and the change in center
</p>
<p>of gravity should be well analyzed.
</p>
<p>Before DesTech Solaris Solar Car, two common combinations of MPPTs are
</p>
<p>tested. First one was to divide the PV surface into two groups and to use two
</p>
<p>MPPTs. This selection, naturally was generally related with the voltages of battery
</p>
<p>and PV combination. As might be expected, this caused important power losses
</p>
<p>during the races because of damaged cells or connections of PV modules. Revised
</p>
<p>solution was to change the battery voltage level and PV groups. The groups
</p>
<p>increased to three with three boost type MPPTs whose algorithm also improved.
</p>
<p>This revision increased the efficiency level significantly. DesTech Solaris, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, uses fifteen MPPTs (five series, three parallels) which are optimized for
</p>
<p>shades and connection damages (please see Fig. 11.11).
</p>
<p>11.1.5 Using Polymer Composites for Increasing Efficiency
</p>
<p>of Energy Harvesting
</p>
<p>Wind turbine (WT) electric generation systems have less subsystems than in
</p>
<p>thermal, hydroelectric or nuclear power plants. And one of the great advantages of a
</p>
<p>wind turbine is, like PVs, it is easier to scale the structure. WT has three main parts,
</p>
<p>the electric generator, blades and the wind turbine tower. It has control systems to
</p>
<p>control the angles of the blades or the tail and for energy transfer. The electric is
</p>
<p>generally a three phase form which has 120&deg; between each other. Based on the
</p>
<p>orientation of the axis of rotation, wind turbines have two main types: Horizontal
</p>
<p>axis wind turbines (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). Figure 11.13
</p>
<p>shows (a) VAWT and (b) HAWT. HAWTs can be scalable from 500 W to MWs,
</p>
<p>but VAWTs are generally chosen for their motion of less vibration and esthetics,
</p>
<p>however they are less efficient and less scalable (mostly 10 kW). The output form
</p>
<p>of both types is alternate current form, as seen in previous section that is on Hybrid
</p>
<p>System. Blades, mechanical connection of blades and if the dimensions of the
</p>
<p>turbine has a small value in scale, sometimes the WT tower can be also polymer
</p>
<p>composites and they are manufactured using vacuum assisted resin transfer method
</p>
<p>which will be told with solar car body production in this section.
</p>
<p>There has been a growing interest to use composite materials in structural
</p>
<p>applications ranging from aircraft and space structures to automotive and marine
</p>
<p>applications instead of conventional materials. This is because advanced compos-
</p>
<p>ites exhibit desirable physical and chemical properties that include high specific
</p>
<p>stiffness and strength, dimensional stability, temperature and chemical resistance,
</p>
<p>and relatively easy processing. A variety of manufacturing methods can be used
</p>
<p>according to the end-item design requirements. Most commercially produced
</p>
<p>composites use a polymer matrix with textile reinforcements such as glass, aramid
</p>
<p>310 A. G&ouml;ren</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and carbon. Besides, the structures and parts which need light weight but also
</p>
<p>greater strength values need to be optimized in more cycles. Analyzing, recon-
</p>
<p>struction using CAD model, redesigning and remanufacturing phases include more
</p>
<p>details and loops. Solar Cars, ballistic parts, fifty meter long wind turbine wings are
</p>
<p>some examples of these light weight technological parts. This section is based on
</p>
<p>solar car manufacturing steps and techniques which is very similar with wind
</p>
<p>turbine blade manufacturing.
</p>
<p>Vacuum assisted resin infusion techniques have become popular in manufac-
</p>
<p>turing of these composites. In the literature, vacuum infusion is known under
</p>
<p>different acronyms. The most popular terms to describe vacuum infusion processes
</p>
<p>are: VARTM-Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding, VARIM-Vacuum
</p>
<p>Assisted Resin Infusion Moulding, SCRIMP&trade;-Seemann Composites Resin
</p>
<p>Infusion Moulding Process, VBRTM-Vacuum Bag Resin Transfer Moulding,
</p>
<p>VARI-Vacuum Assisted Resin Infusion process and so on. All involve basically the
</p>
<p>same technology, and describe methods based on the impregnation of a dry rein-
</p>
<p>forcement by liquid thermoset resin driven under vacuum [28]. Stages can be
</p>
<p>simplified as:
</p>
<p>1. Identifying the important parameters for design,
</p>
<p>2. Preliminary design with constraints,
</p>
<p>3. Identifying the types of fibers and analysis,
</p>
<p>4. Improving design with the conclusions of analysis,
</p>
<p>5. Model production (1:1),
</p>
<p>6. Mould production,
</p>
<p>7. Moulding.

<p>In manufacturing stages of polymer composite products, the analysis&rsquo; of a solar
</p>
<p>car are based on strength, vibration, fluent and efficiency [18, 29]. Figure 11.14
</p>
<p>shows the fluent analysis of Solar Car Solaris S7 (2013) whereas Fig. 11.15 shows
</p>
<p>the fluid mechanics analysis of Solar Car DesTech Solaris (2015). DesTech Solaris
</p>
<p>is 4500 mm in length and 1800 mm in width. Foam mold is formed from modular
</p>
<p>small foam parts. You may find the static structural analysis of Solar Car DesTech
</p>
<p>Solaris in Fig. 11.16.
</p>
<p>In flow analysis of the body, the regions which has turbulences or the regions
</p>
<p>against the flow are found. If vacuum is formed during flow, this causes the vehicle
</p>
<p>pulled backwards by the flow which is called as parachute effect. And if the analysis
</p>
<p>shows high regional forces against flow, this shows the need of smoothing the
</p>
<p>edges or angles of the form. Considering these two main cases, car body is opti-
</p>
<p>mized once more to be efficient. On the other hand, static and dynamic mechanical
</p>
<p>analysis determines the textile fiber angles and density per area (Fig. 11.16). These
</p>
<p>analysis determine the types (carbon, aramid or different fiber glass types) and
</p>
<p>layers of textiles. Analyzing person should not consider just material characteristics,
</p>
<p>but also some special characteristics of the selected types. For example, carbon,

<p>even it is in fiber formed textile, a good conductor which is not so needed when
</p>
<p>transmitting wireless signals or if there are non-isolated poles in a box of carbon
</p>
<p>polymer composites.
</p>
<p>Vacuum Assisted Resin Infusion Moulding (VARIM or VARTM) is a polymer
</p>
<p>composite manufacturing process to produce high-quality large-scale components.
</p>
<p>In this process, dry preform fabrics are placed in an open mold and a plastic vacuum
</p>
<p>bag is placed on the top of the mold. The one-sided mold is connected with a resin
</p>
<p>source and a vacuum pump. The liquid resin infuses into the reinforcing fibers
</p>
<p>thanks to the vacuum drawn through the mold. Curing and de-molding steps follow
</p>
<p>the impregnation process to finish the product. Curing process is very important to
</p>
<p>produce composite parts with optimum mechanical properties [30]. All regions in a
</p>
<p>composite part are supposed to be produced almost at the same curing conditions.
</p>
<p>So, a uniform temperature distribution through the mould surface is of high
</p>
<p>importance.
</p>
<p>The main steps of the process are:
</p>
<p>a. A dry fabric or preform and accompanying materials such as release films, peel
</p>
<p>plies are laid on tool surface.
</p>

<p>b. The preform is sealed with a vacuum bag and the air is evacuated by a vacuum
</p>
<p>pump.
</p>
<p>c. Liquid resin with hardener from an external reservoir is drawn into the com-
</p>
<p>ponent by vacuum.
</p>
<p>d. The liquid resin with hardener is infused into the preform until complete
</p>
<p>impregnation.
</p>
<p>e. Curing and de-molding steps follow the impregnation to finish the product.
</p>
<p>The components of the infusion process utilized in this work are illustrated in
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.17. The function of the each component, given in Fig. 11.17, during
</p>
<p>manufacturing can be summarized as:
</p>
<p>Vacuum bagging films are sealed to the edge of the mould with vacuum bag sealant
</p>
<p>tape to create a closed system.

<p>Double side bag sealant tapes are used to provide a vacuum-tight seal between the
</p>
<p>bag and the tool surface.
</p>
<p>Release films are typically placed directly in contact with the laminate. They sep-
</p>
<p>arate the laminate from the distribution medium. Release films are often perforated
</p>
<p>to ensure that any trapped air or volatiles, which may compromise the quality of the
</p>
<p>laminate, are removed.
</p>
<p>Release fabrics and peel plies are placed against the surface of the laminate. They
</p>
<p>are woven products which are strong and have good heat resistance. Release films

<p>impart a gloss finish on the cured laminate, whereas peel plies and release fabrics
</p>
<p>leave an impression of the weave pattern. Peel plies provide a clean, uncontami-
</p>
<p>nated surface for subsequent bonding or painting (Fig. 11.18).
</p>
<p>Tool release materials are used to release the product from tools easily and obtain a
</p>
<p>smooth surface finish. For this purpose, either self adhesive Teflon films or liquid
</p>
<p>release agents are utilized. In certain situations Teflon films can also temporarily
</p>
<p>solve tool porosity problems.
</p>
<p>A highly permeable layer called &ldquo;resin distribution medium&rdquo; placed on the top of
</p>
<p>the preform spreads the resin quickly over the lateral extent of the part.
</p>
<p>Bleeder/breather fabrics are non-woven fabrics allow air and volatiles to be
</p>
<p>removed from within the vacuum bag throughout the cure cycle. They also absorb
</p>
<p>excess resin present in some composite lay ups.
</p>
<p>For moulding (VARTM or VARTM) process, model of the product which has the
</p>
<p>scale of one is manufactured mostly (Fig. 11.18). However, for some cases which the
</p>
<p>time is very limited for manufacturing the product or if the product is a prototype that
</p>
<p>will be improved or the products will be manufactured in small numbers; the mold
</p>
<p>itself might be also manufactured without manufacturing the model (Fig. 11.19).
</p>
<p>The next step for manufacturing polymer composites is to tool the real model of
</p>
<p>the CAD model. This is needed for manufacturing the mould. However, having the
</p>
<p>exothermic reaction precautions of the curing process of polymer composite

<p>moulding, it is reasonable to tool the mould itself without manufacturing the real
</p>
<p>model if the product is a solar car body.
</p>
<p>Manufacturing the chassis of the solar car, is another challenging process which
</p>
<p>includes mechanical stress analysis and structural optimization. After optimization,
</p>
<p>one of the most efficient way of forming the chassis is to manufacture flat polymer
</p>
<p>composite sandwich parts and cut them using water jet and then form the chassis
</p>
<p>from cut modular parts. In Fig. 11.20, this process and fixing the chassis with the
</p>
<p>shell of the vehicle can be seen. Fixing the chassis with body needs reference points
</p>
<p>in order to have the exact solid model designed. This makes a even 150 kg total
</p>
<p>weight achievable as a solar car (pilot weight excluded).

<p>Figure 11.21 shows the latest solar car of Solaris Projects (Solaris 8

<p>Project EYLEM is a project supported by Izmir Development Agency (IZKA) and
</p>
<p>Dokuz Eylul University which is aimed to be a model for e-mobility in campus
</p>
<p>areas [22, 31]. Not only three EVs are designed and manufactured by Solaris Team,

<p>but also three solar powered charging stations are established in campus area (see
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.15). Project is proposed with the analysis of daily usage of ICE vehicles by
</p>
<p>campus security which is resulted as approximately 50 km. This limited the
</p>
<p>capacity of the batteries on EVs, since the batteries are gel lead acid type of
</p>
<p>batteries for the EVs in this project. A main solar charging station of 54 m2 that has
</p>
<p>a PV group of 5 kWp (4 kWp + 1 kWp) and a battery group of 28.8 kWh
</p>
<p>(21.6 kWh + 7.2 kWh) is located at the center of the campus area. The main station
</p>
<p>is also aimed to be used as a workstation for EVs. The second and third solar
</p>
<p>charging stations are located on 21 m2 and have 1 kWp PVs and 7.2 kWh battery
</p>
<p>groups (see Figs. 11.22 and 11.23). All stations are off-grid designed. So, the
</p>
<p>reasons of having battery packs at charging stations are to schedule the charging at
</p>
<p>night, to use batteries for illumination and hand-held electric motor operated tool
</p>
<p>purposes.
</p>
<p>An enhanced version of these EVs is also designed for EV car races in Turkey
</p>
<p>which is more light and efficient than other three (see Fig. 11.24).
</p>
<p>The electrical connection diagram of the main solar charging station (DECharge
</p>
<p>1) and two other stations might be seen in Fig. 11.25a, b. System output is 48 VDC
</p>
<p>for all. An additional DC/DC converter of 48/72 is used when the nominal voltage
</p>
<p>of the EV which is connected for charging is 72 V.

<p>11.3 Hybrid Combination of Power Generation Systems
</p>
<p>A system is called off-grid, if it is not connected the interconnected electrical grid
</p>
<p>whereas on-grid if it is connected. Storing energy is a more challenging engineering
</p>
<p>problem than generating mainly. If the energy generation system has its own simple
</p>
<p>natural solutions inside, it is more efficient and cost effective. A simple example of
</p>
<p>this is a solar energy generation system for irrigation. It is more efficient and cost
</p>
<p>effective to replace batteries with a water tank which is also a capacity for the
</p>
<p>system model (please see Fig. 11.25a). In this system, electricity generated by PVs
</p>
<p>runs the pump motor and water tank is a capacity that is charging for a potential
</p>
<p>energy level and discharging it through the system which is similar with the battery
</p>
<p>pack replaced. It is sure that if the system is on-grid, the grid itself behaves like an
</p>
<p>infinite capacity that can be used with the unit currency/kWh.
</p>
<p>Figure 11.25b shows another way of forming a hybrid system which is more
</p>
<p>common than Fig. 11.25a. A hybrid system which generates electricity from solar,
</p>
<p>wind and kinematic energy from water flow might be seen in Fig. 11.7b. Hybrid
</p>
<p>charge controller is the point where different sources are combined. Mobile phone
</p>
<p>base stations in outback are good implementations of hybrid systems since hybrid
</p>
<p>systems fills the lack of each other.
</p>
<p>It is well known that the source of a system should be well analyzed and
</p>
<p>designed due to the energy generation efficiencies, cost and dimensions. An
</p>
<p>important point is that the only DC generation is the PV cell part. Mostly, three or
</p>
<p>mono phase AC forms are the outputs of a turbine even it is a wind or another type
</p>
<p>of energy conversion implementation. If it is in mono phase form which is the
</p>
<p>voltage is generally represented with the Eq. 11.20 whereas if it is in three phase
</p>
<p>form that the voltages are represented with the Eqs. (11.21)&ndash;(11.23) (remember that
</p>
<p>x &frac14; 2pf). In that case, the balanced system calculations are used which is based on
the assumption that all three phases are following each other with 120&deg; angles and
</p>
<p>all loads are compensated.

</p>

</p>
<p>optimizes the source usages due to power generation of each source. Eliminating

</p>
<p>three-phase systems can be calculated using the Eqs. 11.24&ndash;11.26. VLL is the
</p>
<p>line-to-line voltage, IL is the line current, h is the angle between the phase voltage
</p>
<p>and the phase current&mdash;the impedance angle. Ptp is the real, Qtp is the reactive and

<p>Stp is the apparent powers for an uncompensated three-phase system.

<p>Stand alone photo voltaic (SAPV) systems are more implemented systems than
</p>
<p>hybrid ones because of their simplicity in design and implementation. Besides,
</p>
<p>installation and maintenance are simpler for SAPV systems. Hybrid systems might
</p>
<p>be efficient and cost effective if there is a great potential of flow in means of wind or
</p>
<p>water. Diesel engine generator or as a very rare implementation, the PEM fuel cell
</p>
<p>can be added to the system, if the system is a continuous generation system like a
</p>
<p>research laboratory which is far away from grid.
</p>
<p>11.4 Conclusion
</p>
<p>In this chapter, it is aimed to convey the experiences gained through several solar
</p>
<p>projects which are stationary or mobile to researchers who are studying on solar
</p>
<p>cars, system modeling and searching for more efficient algorithms or designing
</p>
<p>solar systems. Most of the loads and units of an EV or a SC are modeled and tried to
</p>
<p>be explained how to design with implementations. Solar system can be on a
</p>
<p>mountain that for a research center or on wheels to be challenged. The purpose and
</p>
<p>the output of the system aimed to be analyzed well in order to construct a system
</p>
<p>that is both cost effective and efficient. Last but not least, simplicity should be the
</p>
<p>main target, like as in every design, for being sustainable and stable.

<p>Energy Harvesting from the Fuel Cell
</p>
<p>Hybrid Power Source Based on Extremum
</p>
<p>Seeking Control Schemes
</p>
<p>Nicu Bizon
</p>
<p>Abstract Energy harvesting is known as the conversion process of ambient energy
</p>
<p>into usable electrical energy, including the available and free energy of the
</p>
<p>renewable and green energy sources. This chapter analyzes the possibility to use the
</p>
<p>Extremum Seeking Control schemes for harvesting the hydrogen energy via a Fuel
</p>
<p>Cell Hybrid Power Source. The new Extremum Seeking Control schemes proposed
</p>
<p>here are based on a band-pass filter with the frequencies&rsquo; band larger than that of the
</p>
<p>series combination of high-pass and low-pass filters used in the classical Extremum
</p>
<p>Seeking Control scheme. The mathematical modeling of the Extremum Seeking
</p>
<p>Control scheme that is applied to nonlinear dynamic plant shows the close relations
</p>
<p>between the search speed, the derivatives of the unknown input-to-output map, and
</p>
<p>the cut-off frequencies of the band-pass filter. The simulation results are compared
</p>
<p>with the results of classical Extremum Seeking Control schemes. The ratio of these
</p>
<p>search speeds is used as the performance indicator, besides the tracking accuracy
</p>
<p>evaluated for each control scheme. A Maximum Power Point tracking technique is
</p>
<p>proposed for the Fuel Cell stack based on a modified Extremum Seeking Control
</p>
<p>that slightly improves the performance. A higher value of the searching speed is
</p>
<p>obtained for the same tracking accuracy. The search speed will increase propor-
</p>
<p>tionally with the product of both control parameters (the closed loop gain and the
</p>
<p>dither gain), so it is practically limited for safe reasons. An advanced Extremum
</p>
<p>Seeking Control scheme is proposed here to further reduce the power ripple and
</p>
<p>obtain the imposed performance related to the search speed and tracking accuracy.
</p>
<p>Finally, the dynamical operation of the Fuel Cell stack under constant and variable
</p>
<p>load is shown.

<p>12.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In general, the conversion process of ambient energy into usable electrical energy
</p>
<p>using Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), such as Photovoltaic (PV) panels, and
</p>
<p>Wind Turbines (WT), or on hydrogen energy via a Fuel Cell (FC) stack can be
</p>
<p>modeled by a nonlinear dynamic plant having an unknown input-to-output map,
</p>
<p>y = f(x) with one or more maximums. Usually, one Maximum Power Point (MPP)
</p>
<p>appears in the stationary regime and more local extremes appear on the power
</p>
<p>profile during transitory regimes. The control variable used for searching the MPP
</p>
<p>or global MPP (GMPP) is the current or the voltage, or the power generated by the
</p>
<p>RESs [1, 2] (see Fig. 12.1). Note, that the GMPP must be accurately tracked in
</p>
<p>dynamic regime, too [3, 4].
</p>
<p>The Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Source (FCHPS) architecture which will be ana-
</p>
<p>lyzed in this chapter (see Sect. 12.6) is based on the generic Hybrid Power Source
</p>
<p>(HPS) architecture shown in Fig. 12.1. Note that the FC stack will be connected to
</p>
<p>the ESS bus by a unidirectional DC-DC converter that is controlled using a
</p>
<p>Maximum Power Point (MPP) tracking or a Maximum Efficiency Point (MEP)
</p>
<p>algorithm. The MPP tracking (MPPT) controller will control the FC power flow
</p>
<p>acquiring the samples of FC current and FC voltage (which are noted with iFC and
</p>
<p>vFC in Fig. 12.1). The MPP of the FC stack under different fuelling modes will be
</p>
<p>tracked using the Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) based on adaptive dithering
</p>
<p>action of the reference current (iref) (see Fig. 12.2). The reference current is
</p>
<p>compared to the FC current to generate the switching pulses based on an appro-
</p>
<p>priate current-mode control strategy.
</p>
<p>The MPP tracking (MPPT) algorithms and GMPP tracking (GMPPT) algorithms
</p>
<p>were extensively analyzed in last decade, starting with the required applications
</p>
<p>developed for an array of PV panels [5]. In general, some 1-D models were used to

<p>The PV power profile has multiple extremes due to the partially shading conditions.
</p>
<p>The temperature is also a very important parameter that affects the PV power, so a
</p>
<p>2-D model may be used for the PV system using the irradiance and temperature as
</p>
<p>input variables. Also, the 2-D model for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)
</p>
<p>FC system (which is also known as Polymer Electrolyte Membrane FC system) will
</p>
<p>use the oxygen and hydrogen fueling flow rates. The GMPPT algorithm must track
</p>
<p>the GMPP between the multiple local extremes based on an ESC 2D-scheme, but
</p>
<p>this case will not be approached here.
</p>
<p>A huge number of MPPT and GMPP algorithms have been developed in the last
</p>
<p>decades [6, 7], which are classified as offline, online and hybrid algorithms [6] or as
</p>
<p>conventional, computational, and soft computing techniques [7]. It is obvious that
</p>
<p>these MPPT and GMPP algorithms may be easily applied to harvest energy from all
</p>
<p>types of energy sources such as WT [8] and Fuel Cell (FC) stacks [9]. In this
</p>
<p>chapter the analysis of the MPPT and GMPP algorithms applied to FCHPS is
</p>
<p>shown.

<p>The most know MPPT algorithms are the Perturb and Observe (P&amp;O) [10], the
</p>
<p>Incremental Conductance (IC) [11] and the Hill Climbing (HC) [12] based on fixed
</p>
<p>or variable small searching steps to accurately track the MPP, but with limited
</p>
<p>searching speed because these performance indicators require opposite design
</p>
<p>values for the searching steps. Thus, if the step-size is increased to obtain a higher
</p>
<p>searching speed, then the tracking accuracy will be lower and vice versa.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the advanced ESC schemes for the MPPT algorithms are usually
</p>
<p>proposed here to solve this problem and make less dependent the tracking accuracy
</p>
<p>to model used [5].
</p>
<p>The group of soft computing techniques includes Artificial Intelligence (AI)
</p>
<p>algorithms such as the Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) [13], Artificial Neural
</p>
<p>Network (ANN) [14] and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) [15]. As it was mentioned
</p>
<p>before, these AI-based MPP tracking algorithms are used to optimize the GMPP
</p>
<p>localization [15] in the first stage of searching, level of tracking oscillations [16] in
</p>
<p>second stage of searching or during the tracking phase, and control robustness [17].
</p>
<p>Real-time optimization techniques such as the Ripple Correlation Control (RCC)
</p>
<p>[18] and ESC [19] schemes may increase the performance of searching of the
</p>
<p>GMPP. These GMPPT algorithms are based on perturbed signal injected in the
</p>
<p>control loop, which is usually named dither, or on ripple that normally exists on the
</p>
<p>HPS over the power generated by the energy source, being concentrated in har-
</p>
<p>monics at multiples of the grid (the low frequencies (LF) ripple) and switching
</p>
<p>frequency (the high frequency (HF) ripple).
</p>
<p>Because it is impossible to simultaneously obtain a high searching speed and a
</p>
<p>good tracking accuracy using classical ESC schemes (such the high order ESC
</p>
<p>scheme (hoESC) [20]), advanced ESC schemes were reported in literature [21, 22].
</p>
<p>Two classes of ESC approaches are reported in the literature: perturbation-based
</p>
<p>[23] and model-based methods [24].
</p>
<p>The performance of the 1-D ESC schemes will be analyzed here based on the
</p>
<p>Band Pass Filter ESC (bpfESC) scheme proposed in [25&ndash;27] to increase both
</p>
<p>searching speed and tracking accuracy indicators.
</p>
<p>Hydrogen is recognized as a viable energy source because it is widely spread in
</p>
<p>the Universe, being the most abundant elements in the Universe. The hydrogen
</p>
<p>energy is converted to electrical energy via the PEMFC systems that supply the
</p>
<p>FCHPS. This FCHPS is potentially a green energy resource that has no territorial
</p>
<p>restrictions, a competitive price, and a life cycle which continues to increase each
</p>
<p>year. Because it still requires expensive investments for hydrogen production, it is
</p>
<p>important to extract as much energy as possible from the PEMFC stack in order to
</p>
<p>reduce the hydrogen consumption [28]. Consequently, the PEMFC systems must
</p>
<p>operate close to MPP or MEP. The FC efficiency is with about 5% lower than the
</p>
<p>highest efficiency obtained at the MEP [28]. The MPPT algorithms for FC stack are
</p>
<p>retrieved from the PV system experience, but, in comparison with the PV systems,
</p>
<p>the operating point of a FC stack depends by more parameters of each subsystems
</p>
<p>of the FC system [29, 30]. Hybridization of the FC system with a Storage Devices,
</p>
<p>such as batteries and ultracapacitors which can be mixed in an Energy Storage
</p>
<p>System (ESS), and/or use of some RESs may be an effective technology to
</p>
<p>12 Energy Harvesting from the Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Source &hellip; 333</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>overcome the disadvantages of the FC-alone-powered source [31&ndash;33]. The energy
</p>
<p>harvesting techniques need a MPPT control of adaptive type to harvest all the
</p>
<p>energy available from the microbial FC stacks used to treat the wastewater [34].
</p>
<p>The FC power characteristic can be modeled using analytical equations [29] or
</p>
<p>numerical approximations [35] based on the loading and fueling conditions, stoi-
</p>
<p>chiometric air-fuel ratio, temperature and other parameters, such as transfer coef-
</p>
<p>ficients, internal humidity level, and catalyst layer thickness. Note that the last
</p>
<p>parameters are not simple simply available if these are not specified in the data
</p>
<p>sheet. The temperature is considered constant for the simulations performed here
</p>
<p>because its variation is slower than that on loading and fueling conditions.
</p>
<p>As it was mentioned before, the P&amp;O algorithms are the most used MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithms used for FC system, too [10, 36]. The design of the MPPT algorithms
</p>
<p>must carefully consider the tradeoffs between performance indicators (the searching
</p>
<p>speed and tracking accuracy) and safety operation. The FC power ripple must be as
</p>
<p>small as possible to increase the harvested power and to reduce the mechanical and
</p>
<p>electrical stress of the PEMFC membrane [37]. The control robustness to load
</p>
<p>dynamic could be assured by the load following control combined with the MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithms based on the ESC schemes [38, 39]. Although the ESC-based MPPT
</p>
<p>control is a well-established algorithm [20, 40, 41], certain instability may appear
</p>
<p>when the control parameters vary more quickly than action elements (for example,
</p>
<p>the air compressor) in order to increase the overall FC system efficiency [42, 43].
</p>
<p>So, an MPPT-based energy management to load dynamic is required for the fueling
</p>
<p>flow rates [44&ndash;47]. The MPPT control would be beneficial to operate the FC stack
</p>
<p>because the MEP is difficult to be tracked [48] and in some cases the power density
</p>
<p>is more required than the fuel efficiency [49, 50].
</p>
<p>In this chapter, three real-time optimization algorithms based on ESC schemes
</p>
<p>are compared as performance under different operating conditions of the PEMFC
</p>
<p>system. The ESC has been successfully applied in different engineering applications
</p>
<p>[51], which include the FCHPSs [52, 53]. The tracking accuracy reported for the
</p>
<p>PV inverters is higher than 99.98% [54], but lower accuracy (&lt;99%) is reported for
</p>
<p>the FC inverter [55, 56]. Note that the tracking accuracy is defined as, where PMPP
</p>
<p>is the FC power at the MPP and PFC is the average power effectively generated by
</p>
<p>the FC system operating under MPPT control.
</p>
<p>The chapter is organized as follows. Section 12.2 presents the classical
</p>
<p>High-Order ESC (hoESC) and bpfESC schemes used in simulation. If the transfer
</p>
<p>function of the Band Pass Filter (BPF) from the bpfESC scheme is equivalent to the
</p>
<p>series combination of the High-Pass Filter (HPF) and Low-Pass Filter (LPF) filters
</p>
<p>from the hoESC scheme, then the hoESC and bpfESC schemes are functionally
</p>
<p>equivalent, too. This aspect is briefly shown in this section. Section 12.3 deals with
</p>
<p>signal processing in the loop of the bpfESC scheme. An analytical analysis in the
</p>
<p>frequency and time domain of the bpfESC scheme is presented in order to compare
</p>
<p>the searching speed for both ESC schemes. The simulation results based on generic
</p>
<p>input-output maps validate the analytical results obtained. Section 12.4 briefly
</p>
<p>presents briefly the issue of modeling and control of the PEMFC system.
</p>
<p>Section 12.5 reviews the classical ESC, mESC and aESC schemes applied for the
</p>
<p>334 N. Bizon</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>PEMFC system, highlighting the main topological differences. The performance
</p>
<p>obtained is shown in Sect. 12.6 using the mESC and aESC schemes for PEMFC
</p>
<p>system under constant fueling rate and dynamic load profile. Last Section concludes
</p>
<p>the paper.
</p>
<p>12.2 The Equivalence of the hoESC and bpfESC Schemes
</p>
<p>The ESC schemes scans the plant&rsquo;s input, x, based on the plant&rsquo;s output, y, so that
</p>
<p>y = f(x) is maximized (see Fig. 12.2). The searching of the MPP (y ! yMPP) is
assured if the staring value, x0, will be set in the region of the MPP attraction. The
</p>
<p>noise level (n) does not affect the searching process in the closing loop [25, 26].
</p>
<p>The performance&rsquo;s analysis of the hoESC (Fig. 12.3) and bpfESC (Fig. 12.4)
</p>
<p>schemes is performed in this section. It can be observed that both ESC schemes
</p>
<p>have the same operating relationships, excepting the signal filtering and demodu-
</p>
<p>lation [20, 24&ndash;26].
</p>
<p>For brevity, only relationships of the bpfESC scheme are shown below, con-
</p>
<p>sidering GBPF(s) = GHPF(s) � GLPF(s) = [YBPF(s)/YF(s)] � [YF(s)/YN(s)] =

<p>&bull; The shape of the KSS(bpf) (top), Ksg(bpf) (middle) and H1 (bottom) during the

<p>&bull; The average value of the Ksg(bpf) (middle) and H1 (bottom) is almost the same

<p>Also, it is easy to notice that the values for the KSS(bpf) indicator are 10-times
</p>
<p>lower in case b, when the dither frequency is set to be 10-times lower than in case a.
</p>
<p>Thus, the analytical result given by (12.34), related to the KSS(bpf) indicator, is
</p>
<p>validated through simulation.
</p>
<p>In order to highlight the second term of the relationship (12.29&rsquo;), some simu-
</p>
<p>lations related to the searching phase for the bpfESC schemes using k2 = 0.1, which
</p>
<p>is 100-times higher than the above value, are presented in Fig. 12.9. To assure the

<p>loop stability the k1 gain is set 10-times lower than the above value considering in

<p>simulation csd = 0.02 and fd = 50 Hz.
</p>
<p>The simulation results validate the analytical results presented above for the

<p>bpfESC scheme:
</p>
<p>&bull; The convergence time is proportional to the product of the frequency and

<p>magnitude of the dither. The convergence time is 10-times lower in Fig. 12.10
</p>
<p>than in Fig. 12.7a.
</p>
<p>&bull; Considering the initial value for the KSS(bpf) indicator and Ksg(bpf) parameter, the

<p>csd parameter can be estimated based on (12.34) as 20/(314�3) &cong; 0.021 (for

<p>analysis of the physical and electrochemical phenomena involved [35, 60].
</p>
<p>The PEMFC model implemented in Matlab/Simulink&reg; will be used here because
</p>
<p>this model has good accuracy in reflecting the PEMFC operation. The model
</p>
<p>accuracy is not a critical issue: the ESC-based MPPT algorithm will track the MPP
</p>
<p>of the FC power characteristic that is simulated at 3380 K (because the effects of
</p>
<p>temperature are negligible on MPP position during the tracking process).
</p>
<p>The hydrogen consumption is proportional to the FC current. The MPP con-
</p>
<p>troller will regulate the FC current to maximize the FC power by controlling the
</p>
<p>fueling rate [42, 47]. The humidified air flow is regulated by the air controller,
</p>
<p>which commands the compressor&rsquo;s speed for the required FC power [42]. The
</p>
<p>classical control of the air flow rate is based on maintaining the oxygen excess ratio
</p>
<p>close to 2 [57]. Both fuel flow rates can be used to control the FC power [47], but
</p>
<p>for high FCHPS the air control is usually used [42, 60], without maximization of
</p>
<p>the FC system efficiency [61].
</p>
<p>It is obvious that the FC power could be controlled by both fueling rates or only
</p>
<p>by air flow rate [62, 63], this choose being in general an experimental challenge for
</p>
<p>the FCHPS designers [64&ndash;67]. Anyway, a model for the FCHPS is necessary to
</p>
<p>design the fueling controller. In general, a nine or five states variables are used to
</p>
<p>model the PEMFC system (named full-order model [63, 65] or reduced model
</p>
<p>[66, 67], respectively).
</p>
<p>12.4.2 FC System Control
</p>
<p>12.4.2.1 Air Flow Control
</p>
<p>The air flow rate must be efficiently controlled based on the load following con-
</p>
<p>troller. If the air flow rate is higher that the needed rate then the efficiency of the
</p>
<p>PEMFC system decreases, but also if this decreases under the needed rate, close to
</p>
<p>critical rate, then the air is insufficient and the oxygen starvation may appear. The
</p>
<p>controlled compressor can regulate the cathode excess oxygen ratio, avoiding this
</p>
<p>phenomenon. The air rate may be controlled using a dynamic feed-forward control,

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>linear quadratic regulator, robust control, predictive control, sliding control, MPPT
</p>
<p>control and so on [18, 43, 63, 67, 68]. Here, the ESC-based MPPT control will be
</p>
<p>analyzed.
</p>
<p>12.4.2.2 Hydrogen Flow Control
</p>
<p>The hydrogen flow rate can directly regulate the FC power, respecting the stoi-
</p>
<p>chiometric ratio of hydrogen and oxygen flow rates and dynamic range of the mass
</p>
<p>flow controllers. The hydrogen flow rate is a very good manageable variable,
</p>
<p>instead of the oxygen flow rates that is a poor manipulated variable to control the
</p>
<p>FC power [62&ndash;64]. The optimal hydrogen flow rate is estimated in real-time based
</p>
<p>on the PEMFC efficiency map [69]. This control is benefic for small PEMFC
</p>
<p>systems, where it is impractical to recycle the unreacted hydrogen [50].
</p>
<p>The FC power will fall after few FC time constants after the shutdown of the fuel
</p>
<p>valve and the FC power returns to the previous value if the fuel valve is reopened
</p>
<p>during this delay in powering (when the reactants in the manifolds are not con-
</p>
<p>sumed) [62]. So, the control of the on-off fuel valve must be made at a switching
</p>
<p>frequency lower than 0.5 Hz. Thus, this control of the FC power is impractical due
</p>
<p>to the slow response of the control loop. Consequently, a linear controlled valve is
</p>
<p>used to regulate the pressure of hydrogen [50] or oxygen [45]. The control loop is
</p>
<p>more complex, containing a valve, flowmeter, and an appropriate controller.
</p>
<p>A simple and cheap control loop may be obtained using a digital valve, which is a
</p>
<p>set of carefully sized sonic chokes installed in parallel (supplied by one common
</p>
<p>inlet line and all discharged into a common exit manifold). The chokes calibrated
</p>
<p>and sized in a binary pattern flowing may be digitally controlled using the on-off
</p>
<p>fuel valves in series with each choke. A digital approximation is obtained for the
</p>
<p>hydrogen flow rate that may be designed to be close to those given by the linear
</p>
<p>controlled valve.
</p>
<p>12.4.2.3 Control of Both Fueling Flow Rates
</p>
<p>The control objective is to maximize the net FC power based on the both fueling
</p>
<p>rates that are controlled in the admissible 2-D domain specified by the constraints.
</p>
<p>In this case, a 2D-scheme for controlling both fueling flows can be used [21, 47,
</p>
<p>70]. In general, a large tracking accuracy error is obtained due to the weak con-
</p>
<p>trollability of the fueling flow rates under pulsed load [71]. The modeling and the
</p>
<p>control of the air stream and hydrogen flow with recirculation in a PEMFC system
</p>
<p>with constraints is shown in [66, 72]. The ESC 2D-scheme to control both fueling
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>flows is analyzed in [47]. Here, the proposed mESC scheme of single input single
</p>
<p>output type will be analyzed to highlight its advantages in comparison with the
</p>
<p>classical control schemes.
</p>
<p>12.5 The ESC-Based MPPT Control for FC System
</p>
<p>The objective of the ESC scheme is to generate the control reference (Iref) that
</p>
<p>generates the FC output power close to PMPP without knowing the FC power
</p>
<p>characteristic, PFC = f(IFC). Consequently, the current control mode based on the
</p>
<p>ESC-based MPPT control will be implemented to regulate the fuel flow rate
</p>
<p>(FuelFr) using the following load technique [26, 39].
</p>
<p>12.5.1 The Classical ESC Schemes
</p>
<p>The first order ESC scheme is based on a scalar scheme, which is as that repre-
</p>
<p>sented in Fig. 12.3, but without use of the filters&rsquo; blocks [73].
</p>
<p>The hoESC scheme is augmented with filters of LPF and HPF type, as in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.3 [25] or adapted for the FC system in Fig. 12.13 [26], where the dither
</p>
<p>gain is kA &frac14; A � k2. Note that the LPF is not always necessary in searching and
tracking of the MPP, excepting the noise environment [52].
</p>
<p>12.5.2 The mESC Scheme
</p>
<p>The mESC scheme was shown in Fig. 12.3 [25] and adapted to the FC system in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.14 [26], where the dither gain is kA &frac14; A � k2. The initial value of the FC
current, IFC0, must be set in the attraction region that assures i5 ! IMPP.
</p>
<p>The analysis performed in next sections for the ESC schemes is based on a
</p>
<p>sinusoidal dither, but the dithers&rsquo; shape does not influence the performance [74].
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.13 The hoESC scheme for FC system [26]
</p>
<p>12 Energy Harvesting from the Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Source &hellip; 353</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.5.3 The aESC Scheme
</p>
<p>The aESC scheme is shown in Fig. 12.15 [27]. Note that the dither amplitude is set
</p>
<p>to be proportional with the first harmonic&rsquo;s magnitude (H1) of the FC power: Thus,
</p>
<p>the dither gain is kA &frac14; A � k2 � H1. The first harmonic&rsquo;s magnitude (H1) decreases
during the searching process to almost zero at MPP. Consequently, an insignificant
</p>
<p>ripple of FC power will be on FC bus during the stationary phase. The proposed
</p>
<p>aESC scheme outperforms the classical ESC schemes and the mESC scheme in
</p>
<p>global power efficiency if the search speed is limited to be the same for all ESC
</p>
<p>schemes.
</p>
<p>Note that aESC scheme will have the same operating relationships as mESC
</p>
<p>scheme (1&ndash;4), excepting that dither gain is kA &frac14; A � k2 � H1.
The equivalent aESC (EQaESC) scheme that uses a series connection of HPF
</p>
<p>and LPF, instead of a BPF, is also shown in Fig. 12.15. The aESC and EQaESC
</p>
<p>schemes are functionally equivalent if the filters have the same cut-off frequencies.
</p>
<p>So, the performance of both aESC and EQaESC schemes are almost the same. The
</p>
<p>demonstration can be made in the same manner as in Sect. 12.2 for hoESC and
</p>
<p>bpfESC schemes.

<p>12.6 Testing of the ESC Schemes on PEMFC System
</p>
<p>12.6.1 Testing at Constant Fueling Rate
</p>
<p>The Matlab-Simulink&reg; diagram shown in Fig. 12.16 contains the 6 kW&ndash;45 V
</p>
<p>PEMFC stack system that has the fueling rate set by the FuelFr constant and the FC
</p>
<p>current controlled by the ESC-based MPP controller.
</p>
<p>The preset PEMFC model has the nominal flow rates for hydrogen and air of 50
</p>
<p>and 300 lpm, membrane aria (S) of about 65 cm2, 65 cells in series (resulting the
</p>
<p>voltage at light load, VFC(0), of about 60 V), and the MPP will be around 129 A
</p>
<p>(IMPP) and 6175 W (PMPP). The PEMFC characteristic shown in Fig. 12.17 is
</p>
<p>obtained for the nominal fueling conditions mentioned in this figure, too.
</p>
<p>The PEMFC time constant was set in range 0.2&ndash;2 s and the dither frequency in the
</p>
<p>range 1&ndash;100 Hz in order to analyze the dynamic effects.
</p>
<p>The MPPT process is represented in the P-I phases plane (see Figs. 12.17 and
</p>
<p>12.18). The dither&rsquo;s gain (k2) and dither&rsquo;s frequency modifies the magnitude and
</p>
<p>position of the limit cycle (see Fig. 12.17). This means that the power ripple
</p>
<p>remains constant during the stationary phase (see the zoom on Fig. 12.18). The
</p>
<p>power ripple decreases to zero during the stationary phase if the aESC scheme is
</p>
<p>used. This aESC scheme will be analyzed in Sect. 12.6.4, highlighting its perfor-
</p>
<p>mance in comparison with mESC scheme.

<p>The harmonics&rsquo; magnitudes for three level of the FC power are also shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.17. The magnitude (H1) of the first harmonic decreases during the searching
</p>
<p>phase, being almost zero close to the MPP. In this section the performance of the
</p>
<p>mESC scheme in comparison with the EQmESC and the hoESC scheme will be

</p>
<p>12.6.2 The Equivalence of the mESC and EQmESC
</p>
<p>Schemes for FC System
</p>
<p>The LF equivalence (EQ) of the hoESC and bpfESC schemes was theoretically
</p>
<p>approached in Sect. 12.2 of this chapter. Some simulations to validate this theo-
</p>
<p>retical result were shown in Sect. 12.3.4 and will be shown here for the mESC and
</p>
<p>EQmESC schemes adapted from the hoESC and bpfESC schemes (see Figs. 12.2,
</p>
<p>12.3, 12.13 and 12.14, respectively) for a FC system. The simulation results are
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 12.21. The FC system behavior under the mESC and EQmESC
</p>
<p>schemes is almost the same (see the profile of the FC power and the LF harmonics
</p>
<p>of the iref). The simulation parameters for the both mESC and EQmESC schemes
</p>
<p>are the following: k1 = 400, kA = A � k2 = 0.1 (k2 = 1, and A = 0.1), fd = xd/
(2p) = 100 Hz, bl = 5.5, and bh = 0.5 (thus bl � bh = 2.75). The fuel flow rate is
nominal (50 lpm). A saw-tooth load is used for the FC system without MPP control
</p>
<p>in order to estimate the tracking accuracy (see the top zoom on right part of
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.21). Also, the zooms on the left part of Fig. 12.21 are obtained for bl = 5.5

tionship (12.11) during the search time phase: bl � bh = 1.
</p>
<p>Thus, the simulation results have again validated the analytical results reported
</p>
<p>in Sect. 12.2. The main performances of the mESC scheme based on the results
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 12.21 are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; The oscillations of the FC current is about 0.2 A peak-to-peak, being obtained if
</p>
<p>the dither period (10 ms) is chosen lower than the FC time constant (2 s).
</p>
<p>&bull; The power ripple is about 9 W (0.2 A � 45 V) for kA = 0.1, and the normalized
power ripple is about 9/6000 = 1.5%, being on admissible range mentioned
</p>
<p>in [55].
</p>
<p>&bull; The tracking accuracy is 6150/6250 &cong; 0.984 = 98.4% (see Fig. 12.21), being
</p>
<p>lower than 99% of the value reported in [56];
</p>
<p>&bull; The both mESC and EQmESC schemes have almost the same searching speed.
</p>
<p>For example, the initial search rate of the FC current is about 30 A/s, so the
</p>
<p>power increases with a rate of 1800 W/s, which is verified on the FC power
</p>
<p>shown on the top of Fig. 12.21.

<p>The simulations shown in Fig. 12.22 validate again the relationship (12.16). All
</p>
<p>parameters used in simulation were set the same for both mESC and hoESC
</p>
<p>schemes (k1 = 400, k2 = 1, A = 0.1, fd = xd/(2p) = 100 Hz, and bh = 0.5), with
</p>
<p>the exception of the cut-off frequency of the filters (bl(m) = 5.5 and bl(ho) = 0.5).
</p>
<p>The comparison of the performance obtained for both ESC schemes is as
</p>
<p>following:
</p>
<p>&bull; The searching speeds for both mESC and hoESC schemes are time dependent
</p>
<p>variable. For example, the speeds&rsquo; rates evaluated at 2 s are about 1500 Ws&minus;1
</p>
<p>and 1000 Ws&minus;1 for the mESC and hoESC schemes, respectively. The speeds&rsquo;
</p>
<p>ratio is 2.2 based on (12.16), being higher than the ratio evaluated based on the
</p>
<p>simulation results (which is 1500/1000 = 1.5) due to the harmonics effects
</p>
<p>explained in Sect. 12.3.
</p>
<p>&bull; The searching speed is proportional to the dither magnitude based on relation-
</p>
<p>ship (12.35) and (12.40). This results are validated by the results shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.22 (see zoom on left of Fig. 12.22) for k2 = 1 and A = 1. The searching
</p>
<p>speed is about ten time higher for both ESC schemes if the dither amplitude is
</p>
<p>10 times higher than the value A = 0.1, which was mentioned above.

<p>ple, the magnitude of second harmonic is with about 30% higher, so the dither&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>persistence on the mESC loop is better than that resulting on the hoESC loop.
</p>
<p>&bull; The design of the k1 gain to be proportional to the dither frequency will assure

</p>
<p>12.6.4 The Comparative Analysis of the aESC and mESC
</p>
<p>Schemes
</p>
<p>As it was mentioned above, the main difference between the mESC scheme and the
</p>
<p>aESC scheme is related to the dither gain, which is constant, kA(m) = A � k2, and
time variable, kA(a) = A � k2 � H1, respectively, where H1 is the magnitude of first
harmonic of the FC power.
</p>
<p>Consequently, the searching speed for the aESC and the mESC schemes are
</p>
<p>given by (12.46) and (12.47) [25, 26]:

</p>
<p>If the same design parameters will be used for the aESC and mESC schemes
</p>
<p>(k1(a) = k1(m) and k2(a) = k2(m) and so on), then the ratio of searching speeds will be:

</p>
<p>If the same filters are used, BPF(a)�BPF(m), and the S1 saturation block has the
limits 0 and 1, then kA(a) = kA(m) during the searching phase (when H1 &gt; 1) and
</p>
<p>kA(a) = H1kA(m) if the MPP was located and H1 &lt; 1. The H1 magnitude is very
</p>
<p>small close to the MPP, so the FC power ripple is negligible during the stationary
</p>
<p>phase and the MPP is found accurately (see Fig. 12.23, where the magnitudes of the
</p>
<p>first three harmonics (H1, H2, and H3) of the FC power are shown).
</p>
<p>Note that the searching speed will be H1&mdash;times higher for the aESC scheme in
</p>
<p>comparison with the mESC scheme if the S1 saturation block has the upper limit set
</p>
<p>to infinit. The rate limiter with saturation of the FuelFr value will assure the safe
</p>
<p>operation for the PEMFC system (see the flow rate regulator diagram in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.23).

<p>The FC power density (the ratio of the FC power to membrane aria), which is the

</p>
<p>modulates the dither signal (with A = 1 and the dither gain k2 = 10; see
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.24).
</p>
<p>If the same k1 gain (k1(a) = k1(m)) and filters (BPF(a) � BPF(m)) are used, A = 1
and the S1 saturation block has the upper limit 0.5, then kA(a) = 0.5 (because

<p>12.6.5 Testing the aESC Scheme on FCHPS
</p>
<p>The FCHPS is shown in Fig. 12.26, where an equivalent load is used to test the
</p>
<p>FCHPS. The design of the FCHPS is detailed in [27]. Here, only the results are
</p>
<p>shown to validate the performance of the aESC scheme. Two control loops can be
</p>
<p>identified in Fig. 12.26: the load following loop (with Gi = 4 set in relation (12.45))
</p>
<p>and the aESC-based MPPT loop.
</p>
<p>The results of the FCHPS behavior under aESC-based MPPT control are shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 12.26 as following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Plot 1: the load power profile, including a zoom of load ripple and its power

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The MPPT process can be understood based on the results shown in Fig. 12.27:
</p>
<p>the H1 magnitude increases quickly at any load variation, which actually means a
</p>
<p>FC power that follows the load profile based on the load following control
</p>
<p>implemented.
</p>
<p>The search speed is about a few kW/s (see plot 2 on Fig. 12.27).
</p>
<p>The power flow balance on DC bus is assured by the ESS, which will operate in
</p>
<p>charge depletion mode load (Pload[ gboostPFC ) PESS[ 0) or in the charge
increasing mode (Pload\gboostPFC ) PESS\0).
</p>
<p>12.7 Conclusion
</p>
<p>In this chapter, besides the well-known results for the hoESC scheme, which are
</p>
<p>obviously available for the all ESC schemes, new analytical results related to the
</p>
<p>bpfESC scheme are shown. The main results are: (1) the searching speed may be
</p>
<p>estimated based on the derivatives of the unknown input-output map; (2) the har-
</p>
<p>monics magnitudes during the searching phase could be evaluated based on (12.34);
</p>
<p>(3) the ratio of the searching speeds can be estimated during the searching phase
</p>
<p>based on (12.41).
</p>
<p>Note that these results related to ratio estimation must be interpreted in the
</p>
<p>context of the modeling approach considered, which was kept at a simple level for
</p>
<p>the signal processing in the ESC loop. All the analytical results obtained were
</p>
<p>validated by simulation using generic input-output maps. The FC power

<p>characteristic was used as input-output map to validate the above results on this
</p>
<p>nonlinear map (see Sect. 12.6). The mean value of the searching speeds ratio was
</p>
<p>computed to shown that this is close to the average approximation of this ratio
</p>
<p>based on a frequency approach given by (12.13). Also, it can be noted that the
</p>
<p>dither persistence is dependent to the BPF cut-off frequencies.
</p>
<p>The mESC scheme based on the bpfESC was proposed to improve the perfor-
</p>
<p>mance related to searching speed process. The main results of the comparison of the
</p>
<p>mESC scheme with the hoESC scheme are the following: (1) the rate of searching
</p>
<p>speeds is higher than 1.5 in all cases; (2) the dither&rsquo;s persistence is improved if the
</p>
<p>frequencies band of the BPF is enlarged; (3) the search speed could be set up to safe
</p>
<p>value by increasing the dither gain until the admissible value that is designed for an
</p>
<p>imposed performance for the tracking accuracy and the FC power ripple.
</p>
<p>Note that the FC power ripple and tracking accuracy are almost the same for
</p>
<p>both ESC schemes analyzed. These performance indicators were improved by the
</p>
<p>aESC scheme that was analyzed in comparison with mESC scheme (see
</p>
<p>Sect. 12.6.4): (1) the tracking accuracy is higher than 99.76%, (2) the FC power
</p>
<p>ripple is negligible during the stationary phase after the MPP is found; (3) the
</p>
<p>search speed could be set up to safe value, but maintaining the performance related
</p>
<p>to the tracking accuracy and the FC power ripple; (4) the aESC-based MPPT
</p>
<p>control is robust to load profiles that include high dynamic variations; (5) the
</p>
<p>aESC-based MPPT control is simple to be implemented.
</p>
<p>It was shown that the aESC scheme slightly outperforms the mESC scheme in
</p>
<p>total power efficiency and performance obtained for any load profile. The aESC
</p>
<p>searching speed is H1 times higher than the mESC searching speed, which finally
</p>
<p>means a very short time to find and track the current MPP.
</p>
<p>Thus, the aESC-based MPPT control combined with the load following control
</p>
<p>has good performance for nonlinear loads with unmodeled dynamics.
</p>
<p>The performance of the FCHPS with two control loops that was highlighted in
</p>
<p>this chapter could influence the designers to experiment this control architecture.

<p>Energy Efficiency of PEM Fuel Cell
</p>
<p>Hybrid Power Source
</p>
<p>Nicu Bizon and Mircea Raceanu
</p>
<p>Abstract The chapter deals with a single DC bus hybrid configuration of a power
</p>
<p>source required for an automotive application. Such system architecture is the best
</p>
<p>choice for interconnecting multiple energy sources in order to meet the load profile
</p>
<p>in the most efficient way. This work analyzes a new PEM Fuel Cell stack-Hybrid
</p>
<p>Power Source (PEMFCs-HPS) topology consisting of a 5 kW PEMFC stack (pri-
</p>
<p>mary source of power) and a bank of ultracapacitors (130 F, 56 V, 57 Wh) (aux-
</p>
<p>iliary power source) to fulfill the high energy and high power requirements of the
</p>
<p>vehicle applications, wherein the power demand is impulsive rather than constant.
</p>
<p>This topology uses three programmable unidirectional DC/DC converters which
</p>
<p>connects the PEMFCs, the UC and the programmable electronic load. The energy
</p>
<p>management strategy (EMS) for different power sources has great effect in
</p>
<p>decreasing the fuel consumption, increasing the performance and the lifetime of the
</p>
<p>fuel cells. The proposed EMS is based on the FC efficiency map and on the state of
</p>
<p>charge of the UC. The EMS is used to split the power between the PEMFCs and the
</p>
<p>UC in the hybrid arrangement to fulfil the power requirement, which depends on the
</p>
<p>operating conditions considering the optimum power of PEMFCs and UC. An
</p>
<p>algorithm the EMS is able to achieve the steady-state PEMFCs operating with
</p>
<p>minimum hydrogen consumption and the UC state of charge (SoC) maintaining at
</p>
<p>values higher than 20%. The system ability to efficiently follow the load variations
</p>
<p>under that EMS is also presented. The consumption of hydrogen was reduced by

<p>13.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Due to their operating principle through which hydrogen and oxygen are electro-
</p>
<p>chemically converted into electricity, with high conversion efficiency, low tem-
</p>
<p>perature operation and practically no pollutant emissions, Proton Exchange
</p>
<p>Membrane Fuel Cell stack (PEMFCs) became very attractive for both mobile and
</p>
<p>stationary power applications [1&ndash;3].
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, PEMFCs are characterized by relatively poor dynamics, being
</p>
<p>unable to follow fast transients in power demand. Besides that, it was observed that
</p>
<p>operating a fuel cell on pulsed load causes its relatively fast degradation [4, 5]. One
</p>
<p>of the main weak points of the PEMFCs is its slow dynamics mainly due to the
</p>
<p>hydrogen and air supply subsystems [6, 7]. The fuel starvation phenomenon will
</p>
<p>occur during fast load demand, which will cause a high voltage drop in a short time
</p>
<p>[8]. To solve this problem, the PEMFCs must to be efficiently operated in con-
</p>
<p>junction with other energy sources or energy storage systems [9, 10].
</p>
<p>Taking into account these aspects we can conclude that adding on an energy
</p>
<p>storage system (ESS) to the PEMFCs power source is a necessary step [11, 12].
</p>
<p>These are some reasons of adding an energy storage system (ESS) to the PEMFCs
</p>
<p>power system. The PEMFCs/ESS hybrid could be operated so that PEMFCs should
</p>
<p>meet the load power demand at steady-state and ESS (Energy Storage System) is
</p>
<p>buffering power transients [13].
</p>
<p>Rechargeable batteries are the most common devices used for electric energy
</p>
<p>storage, but recent advances in manufacturing and materials technology made that
</p>
<p>ultracapacitors (UC) into be considered strong competitors. Unlike battery storage,
</p>
<p>based on chemical reactions, which gives a slower energy transfer process in both
</p>

<p/>

<p>directions, UCs store energy electrostatically and have very low internal resistance,
</p>
<p>resulting in very fast charge/discharge rates with very little power loss and great
</p>
<p>overall efficiencies [3, 14]. It seems that the energy density remains the last
</p>
<p>advantage that batteries have over ultracapacitors, but only transitory, new better
</p>
<p>materials resulting in narrowing the gap between them.
</p>
<p>Hybrid Power Sources (HPS) in general and PEMFCs/UC sources in particular
</p>
<p>are currently being intensively investigated because of their use in stationary and
</p>
<p>vehicular applications [4, 15, 16]. PEMFCs are designed for continuous energy
</p>
<p>supply and are best operated at constant operating conditions [17]. They work poorly
</p>
<p>in the presence of power fluctuations and cannot handle high power demands. UCs,
</p>
<p>on the other hand, have relatively very low energy densities and very high power
</p>
<p>densities. UCs are used for energy storage and to protect the FC from power tran-
</p>
<p>sients. The purpose of any hybrid power sources that involves more than one device
</p>
<p>is to put together the advantage of the various devices in one single system and
</p>
<p>increase the fuel cell operating life and improve the device efficiency [18].
</p>
<p>In specialized literature, passive and active hybrid configurations are usually
</p>
<p>presented separately. The passive hybrid configuration is based on parallel con-
</p>
<p>nection between main and auxiliary sources. In a passive configuration the choice of
</p>
<p>energy management algorithms are greatly limited [19]. Active hybrid configuration
</p>
<p>needs the introduction of energy conversion steps between main and auxiliary
</p>
<p>sources. This provides great flexibility during design and different configurations can
</p>
<p>be realized. Through the power converters, power-sharing between the main and
</p>
<p>auxiliary source can be successfully implemented.
</p>
<p>Various control strategies to manage energy in a hybrid system [20&ndash;22] have
</p>
<p>been proposed in various applications. In some papers [23, 24], EMS are applied to
</p>
<p>high-power electric vehicles based on FC, battery and UC. Other papers [25&ndash;28]
</p>
<p>use control strategies based on fuzzy logic control, which determine the operating
</p>
<p>point of the power converter FC depending on the load power and the battery state
</p>
<p>of charge (SoC).
</p>
<p>In the paper [29] three energy management strategies for fuel cell hybrid
</p>
<p>vehicles were presented. The strategies are based on the knowledge of the fuel cell
</p>
<p>efficiency map: two of them are heuristic type strategies and the third strategy is
</p>
<p>based on constrained nonlinear programming.
</p>
<p>Due to the different characteristics of the various sources of energy, efficiency
</p>
<p>and fuel economy the HPS mainly depend on an adequate strategy for the energy
</p>
<p>management. In this chapter, the Energy Management Strategy between PEMFCs
</p>
<p>and UC is based on setting a number of power sub-regions of 1000 W in the range
</p>
<p>of 1&ndash;5 kW, in which we know the point of maximum efficiency, respectively the
</p>
<p>gas consumption in those sub-regions. Each sub-region has a maximum efficiency
</p>
<p>point while PEMFCs works in stationary conditions, at the lowest consumption of
</p>
<p>the hydrogen. Depending on the load and on the UC state of charge (SoC &gt; 20%)
</p>
<p>the power that is generated by the PEMFCs is established, according to the fuel cell
</p>
<p>power and efficiency map the hydrogen and air supply flows are established. The
</p>
<p>EMS algorithm identifies the sub-region in which the PEMFCs works with the
</p>
<p>maximum efficiency. If the power supplied by the fuel cell is greater than the power

<p>loads, the EMS will manage the UC surplus power through the DC/DC charge UC
</p>
<p>and this charging is controlled. The EMS algorithm is developed in NI LabVIEW
</p>
<p>using a state machine architecture, implemented in FPGA to run at a speed of
</p>
<p>execution of 100 ls. The novelty of this article is to use a DC/DC converter which
</p>
<p>is connected between PEMFCs and UC, and is designed to load the power excess in
</p>
<p>UC, thus making the PEMFCs to operate in regime static. The decreasing of
</p>
<p>hydrogen consumption depends on the operation of PEMFCs in the maximum
</p>
<p>efficiency point in that sub-region. The EMS algorithm proposed is tested experi-
</p>
<p>mentally and the results show favourable performances.
</p>
<p>The chapter is organized as follows: Sect. 13.2 introduces the configuration of
</p>
<p>the HPS and describes the experimental setup including the NI Compact-RIO
</p>
<p>hardware; Sect. 13.3 proposes the EMS based on the fuel cell efficiency map and on
</p>
<p>the state of charge of the UC including the NI Labview software; In Sect. 13.4, the
</p>
<p>experimental results are presented and discussed; and finally the conclusions are
</p>
<p>summarized in Sect. 13.5.
</p>
<p>13.2 Hybrid Power Sources Design
</p>
<p>13.2.1 General Architecture of the Hybrid Power Source
</p>
<p>In order to increase the power of the fuel cells from 10 to 90% is about 2 s are
</p>
<p>required [30]. On the other hand, the sudden variations of the load power could lead
</p>
<p>to a dramatic decrease of the life of cell. Hybridized fuel cell power sources for
</p>
<p>automotive applications can tolerate in this way much more transitory than a single
</p>
<p>cell. The hybrid system has a much better dynamic response, thus contributing to
</p>
<p>increasing the lifetime of the fuel cells.
</p>
<p>Figure 13.1 shows a generic HPS with two power flows (FC and UC), the
</p>
<p>required power load of the fuel cell being provided by a unidirectional converter.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>UC is directly connected to the load through a bidirectional converter. It provides a
</p>
<p>good suppression of transition and peak power. The energy stored in the UC is not
</p>
<p>limited to the fuel cell or the load. The power of each source can be controlled. UC
</p>
<p>shows its usefulness when braking regenerative.
</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this architecture is that the fuel cell connection always aims
</p>
<p>the load profile. The power management strategy is more difficult for small vari-
</p>
<p>ations in the load. To remove these disadvantages, between fuel cell and UC, an
</p>
<p>unidirectional converter DC/DC was inserted. The role of this converter is to guide
</p>
<p>the surplus power from the fuel cell to the UC.
</p>
<p>13.2.2 Proposed Architecture of the Hybrid Power Source
</p>
<p>A hybrid fuel cell/ultracapacitor architecture (photos in Fig. 13.2) is proposed for a
</p>
<p>FC power system intended to be used in an automotive application. A single DC
</p>
<p>BUS topology was chosen because it seems to be the best choice for intercon-
</p>
<p>necting multiple energy sources in order to meet the load profile in the most
</p>
<p>efficient way [31].
</p>
<p>The power system, schematically presented in Fig. 13.3, is based on a 40 cells,
</p>
<p>5 kW, 40 V NEDSTACK PEM Fuel cell stack and a 23 cells, 130 F, 56 V
</p>
<p>MAXWELL Ultracapacitor bank.
</p>
<p>The PEMFC stack is fed with humidified hydrogen and air, at a stoichiometry of
</p>
<p>1.25 and 2, respectively. The load of the system is represented by a 60 V, 240 A,
</p>
<p>5 kW IT8518C electronic load.
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.2 Test bench PEMFCs/UC&mdash;Hybrid Power Sources for real-time control

<p>13 Energy Efficiency of PEM Fuel Cell &hellip; 375</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Since the power system has two sources, it takes at least two converters to
</p>
<p>control the bus voltage and the power split between the two sources. The inde-
</p>
<p>pendent control through the DC/DC converters of both FC and UC allows com-
</p>
<p>bining the energy sources on a BUS, each operating at a different voltage. As it is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 13.2, a unidirectional DC/DC boost converter is used to connect the
</p>
<p>fuel cell stack to the bus (DC/DC boost FC_Conv), and two unidirectional DC/DC
</p>
<p>boost converters are used to connect the ultracapacitor bank to the FCs for charging
</p>
<p>(DC/DC boost UC_ch_Conv) and to the DC BUS for discharging (DC/DC boost
</p>
<p>UC_disch_Conv), respectively. The latter ones could be replaced by a single
</p>
<p>bi-directional converter.
</p>
<p>The power system objective is to meet the load power demand at the lowest fuel
</p>
<p>consumption and to reduce the transitional demands for the PEMFCs, simultane-
</p>
<p>ously with keeping the UC State of Charge (SoC) above 20%. SoC is defined as the
</p>
<p>UC voltage multiplied by 100 over its maximum rated voltage and ranges from 0%
</p>
<p>at no charge to 100% at full charge.
</p>
<p>13.2.3 PEM Fuel Cell Stack
</p>
<p>The main part of the Hybrid Power Sources is the fuel cell stack, where the
</p>
<p>electrochemical reaction between the fuel (hydrogen) and the oxidant (usually
</p>
<p>oxygen from air) occurs, producing electricity and heat. The behaviour of the PEM
</p>
<p>fuel cell stack depends of particularly variables. A Nedstack P5.0-40 PEMFCs,
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.3 Proposed block diagram of the FCS/UC power source
</p>
<p>376 N. Bizon and M. Raceanu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>composed from 40 cells for a nominal maximum power of 5 kW, operated at
</p>
<p>atmospheric pressure to about 3 bar, was used for experimental investigation [32].
</p>
<p>The operating voltage of the stack is a function of current and decreased with
</p>
<p>increasing power (Table 13.1).
</p>
<p>The test bench is represented by a hydrogen supply subsystem to the anode, air
</p>
<p>supply subsystem to the cathode, de-ionized water serving as coolant in the cooling
</p>
<p>channel, de-ionized water to humidify the hydrogen and the air flow, a pro-
</p>
<p>grammable electronic load, DC/DC converters, a control process and an interface.
</p>
<p>High purity hydrogen (99.995%) and compressed air are used as a fuel and as an
</p>
<p>oxidant. The hydrogen is supplied as fuel and air is supplied as oxidant reactant.
</p>
<p>Both reactants are controlled at the entrance of the fuel cell stack with two mass
</p>
<p>flow controllers, located before the bubble humidifiers. Pressures of the anode and
</p>
<p>cathode sides are controlled by back pressure regulators (Alicat Instruments). The
</p>
<p>voltage set point for the flow rates and pressures are connected to the NI 9263
</p>
<p>analog output module. Humidity levels are verified time to time with downstream
</p>
<p>humidity sensors. The maximum mass flow rates are calculated at the maximum
</p>
<p>power demand, maximum stoichiometric ratios, and the minimum cell voltage,
</p>
<p>taking into account the specification of the 5000 W PEM fuel cell. The minimum
</p>
<p>cell voltage is 0.5 V because any voltage below this value may result in deterio-
</p>
<p>ration of the PEM fuel cell stack.
</p>
<p>An important parameter namely the temperature is measured by T-type ther-
</p>
<p>mocouples inserted in a NI 9213 thermocouple input module system and regulated
</p>
<p>by a cooling water circuit which includes a water pump, a needle valve for flow
</p>
<p>water control, a cold exchanger and a heater. Another water circuit is used to
</p>
<p>condense the water in the gaseous phase.
</p>
<p>The tests were carried out by initialling the PEMFCs in flow-through anode
</p>
<p>fuelling mode. This operation was necessary to estimate the current/voltage refer-
</p>
<p>ence characteristics. The next step was focused on the comparison between the
</p>
<p>PEMFCs as single equipment and the PEMFCs &amp; BoP Balance of Plant (BoP)

<p>The reference characteristics of the NEDSTACK FCS were determined by
</p>
<p>supplying pure hydrogen at anode and air at cathode, in the following conditions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Anode supply stoichiometry of 1.25 and cathode stoichiometry of 2.0;
</p>
<p>&bull; Relative humidity: 80&ndash;100% for gaseous phase;
</p>
<p>&bull; Stack temperature: 65 &deg;C.
</p>
<p>The obtained polarization curve (Fig. 13.4), illustrates the power versus current
</p>
<p>characteristic. We have to mention that the hydrogen and air flow rates are pro-
</p>
<p>portional to the current produced by the stack. Moreover, the consumptions of
</p>
<p>reactants according to the power fuel cells, is presented in Fig. 13.5.
</p>
<p>The polarization curve obtained herein provides the ideal electrochemical results
</p>
<p>from the fuel cell stack. It could be considered as reference point for adjusting of the
</p>
<p>stoichiometric ratios, during sudden load. During this test the PEM fuel cell stack
</p>
<p>voltage decreases proportionally with the current and reaches the minimum cor-
</p>
<p>responding to the maximum current. The PEM fuel cell stack power increases
</p>
<p>proportionally with the current and the maximum is obtained at the maximum
</p>
<p>current (230 A) [6, 33].
</p>
<p>13.2.4 Ultracapacitor
</p>
<p>Ultracapacitors are devices for storing energy much more attractive than batteries,
</p>
<p>which have a much higher yield, higher power density and the number of
</p>
<p>charge/discharge up to a million times. The energy density of UC-s is much higher
</p>
<p>than traditional electrolytic capacitors, therefore, they can act as a bridge between
</p>
<p>the high power capacitors and high energy batteries.
</p>
<p>The ultracapacitor used in this application is produced by Maxwell. The ultra-
</p>
<p>capacitor electrolyte uses as an organic substance that is called acetonitrile. This
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>allows a higher operating voltage than an aqueous electrolyte. Organic electrolyte
</p>
<p>has a lower freezing point allowing use in a wider range of temperatures (&minus;40 to
</p>
<p>+40 &deg;C). Carbon electrodes are activated and use as a cellulose separator. Its
</p>
<p>specifications are shown in Table 13.2. The reason for the high nominal voltage
</p>
<p>VUC, max = 56 V means that several cells are connected in series in order to form
</p>
<p>a module or a bank of ultracapcitoars. Next it will be labelled &ldquo;UC&mdash;
</p>
<p>ultracapacitor&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The ultracapacitor must not be exploited over the specified maximum voltage. If
</p>
<p>it accidentally exceeds the upper limit of the mentioned voltage, it will result in
</p>
<p>shortened life and, in extreme cases, flue gas accumulated in the cell, due to
</p>
<p>overvoltage condition. To ensure maximum performance and longer life, the
</p>
<p>operating voltage should be between nominal voltage (56 V) and half the voltage
</p>
<p>(28 V). Usually in this operating range, the energy available is about 75%.

<p>13.2.5 DC/DC Boost Converters
</p>
<p>Our application is built with three DC/DC unidirectional converters: the first con-
</p>
<p>verter is disposed between the PEMFCs and load, it has an output power of 5000 W
</p>
<p>(DC/DC boost FC_Conv.); the second converter is placed between PEMFCs and
</p>
<p>UC, it has a power of 1,250 W, and it is designed to load the excess power from the
</p>
<p>PEMFCs in the UC (DC/DC boost UC_ch. Conv.); the third converter is connected
</p>
<p>between UC and load, and it is designed to supplement the power flow, when the
</p>
<p>PEMFCs power is smaller than the load power, the power output being 1,250 W
</p>
<p>(DC/DC boost UC_Disch. Conv.). The DCC5500 type converters are built by the
</p>
<p>company Ripenergy.
</p>
<p>The characteristics of the converter are: variable input voltage: 20&ndash;40 V; output
</p>
<p>voltage: 40&ndash;60 V; adjustable output voltage via 0&ndash;10 V input signal; remote shut
</p>

<p>13.2.6 NI Compact-RIO Hardware
</p>
<p>The test station is fully automated using a supervisory control and data acquisition
</p>
<p>system that utilizes the NI CompactRIO 9082 platform. The system consists of an
</p>
<p>embedded controller for communication and processing, a reconfigurable chassis
</p>
<p>housing the user-programmable FPGA and graphical LabVIEW software for rapid
</p>
<p>real-time, windows and FPGA programming.
</p>
<p>The system has twoNI 9205 analog input modules to read the analog parameters of
</p>
<p>the fuel cell stack, one NI 9263 analog output module for control mass-flow/pressure
</p>
<p>controllers and DC/DC converters, one NI 9213 thermocouple input module, one NI

</p>
<p>The aim of the hardware system was to control the power between the PEMFCs
</p>
<p>and the UC, which depends on the operating conditions by taking into account the
</p>
<p>optimum power of the PEMFCs and the UC state of charge, by adjusting of their

</p>
<p>13.3.1 Efficiency Analysis for the Hybrid PEMFCs/UC
</p>
<p>Power Source
</p>
<p>The load power at all times, Pload t&eth; &THORN;, has to be supplied by the FC power, PFC t&eth; &THORN;,
and by the UC power, PUC t&eth; &THORN;, so that the power balance on the DC bus must be
fulfilled permanently.
</p>
<p>At every moment,
</p>
<p>PFC t&eth; &THORN; � gFC � gFC=B &thorn;PUC t&eth; &THORN; � gUC � gFC=UC � gUC=B &frac14; Pload t&eth; &THORN;; 8t &eth;13:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>where: gFC; gFC=B; gUC; gFC=UC; gUC=B are respectively the efficiency of the FC, the
</p>
<p>efficiency of the power converter connecting the FC to the BUS, the efficiency of
</p>
<p>the UC, the efficiency of the UC charging power converter and the efficiency of the
</p>
<p>power converter connecting the UC to the BUS.
</p>
<p>In order to set up an Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for the hybrid
</p>
<p>PEMFCs/UC power source that meets the above mentioned objective, the 5 kW
</p>
<p>PEMFCs efficiency versus load power characteristic was determined.
</p>
<p>As presented in the Fig. 13.7, there is an operational zone where the PEMFCs
</p>
<p>efficiency is the highest, and another zone, where the PEMFCs efficiency is
</p>
<p>unacceptably low. This efficiency map shape at low power is due to the need of
</p>
<p>using almost all the generated power to compensate the parasitic power losses.
</p>
<p>The implemented EMS is intended to solve the problem of the power split
</p>
<p>between the PEMFCs and the UC, in compliance to Eq. (13.1) and in accordance
</p>
<p>with the following constraints:
</p>
<p>&bull; restricted PEMFCs power dynamics to avoid damage the stack;
</p>
<p>&bull; using UC state of charge as a parameter to be maintained in the fixed limits:
</p>
<p>20&ndash;100%.
</p>
<p>13 Energy Efficiency of PEM Fuel Cell &hellip; 381</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In addition to these constraints, the hydrogen consumption has to be monitored.
</p>
<p>As we already mentioned, a PEMFCs could not operate alone and some
</p>
<p>sub-systems to provide and control the operating conditions and parameters are
</p>
<p>necessary, but not limited to, pumps, blowers, heat-exchangers, sensors and con-
</p>
<p>trollers, all being named BoP. The power conditioning system, including the
</p>
<p>DC/DC converter, is consuming power too [33].
</p>
<p>The PEMFCs efficiency is defined as the ratio between the maximum generated
</p>
<p>power and the heating power of the hydrogen consumed at anode to generate that

<p>1850 W. Over that limit, a slight decrease in system efficiency is noticed, because
</p>
<p>of the greater increase in BoP supply when the generated power is increasing.
</p>
<p>13.3.2 EMS Algorithm
</p>
<p>The EMS algorithm is based on the above mentioned PEMFCs efficiency map and
</p>
<p>was implemented in one main routine and five subroutines.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 13.8 the main routine schematic is presented. This routine is programmed
</p>
<p>into a technical &ldquo;state machine&rdquo; and it is called the software interface (Fig. 13.10).
</p>
<p>The first block decision of the routine, Run Control, if it is true (controlled from the
</p>
<p>software interface) then the EMS algorithm is ran. The last block of decision, Stop
</p>
<p>Control, if it is true then the controller switches the safety system (gas flow stops
</p>
<p>and lock converters). As a method to reduce the PEMFCs transients, its power
</p>
<p>range was divided in 5 equal sub-domains (1000 W), depending on the load power,
</p>
<p>PL, the algorithm execute one of the sequences from 1 to 5. The PEMFCs power on
</p>
<p>each of them was being set to the value corresponding to the local maximum
</p>
<p>efficiency and allowing in this way a smooth transition. In order to avoid operating
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.8 EMS main routine
</p>
<p>13 Energy Efficiency of PEM Fuel Cell &hellip; 383</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the PEMFCs in the low efficiency zone, at the power system switch-on the PEMFCs
</p>
<p>operational point will be always set to the highest efficiency point by feeding it with
</p>
<p>the corresponding hydrogen and air flows.
</p>
<p>In the Fig. 13.9 one of the sequences is presented (Sequence 2) was chosen as an
</p>
<p>example, but it should be noted that all sequences are logically identical. The input
</p>
<p>signals of the EMS algorithm are SoC of the ultracapacitor (SoC_UC), fuel cell
</p>
<p>power (PFC), load power (PL), fuel cell total current (IFC), load current (IL), charge
</p>
<p>current in UC (IUC_ch1), discharge current from UC (IUC_disch2), fuel cell current
</p>
<p>before FC converter (IFC1), fuel cell current after FC converter (IFC2) and output
</p>
<p>signals are hydrogen and air flow values (H2_SP, Air_SP) and the reference of the
</p>
<p>DC/DC converter for switching (FC_Conv, UC-ch_Conv, UC-disch_Conv).
</p>
<p>For each PEMFCs power sub-domain, if the load power required exceeds the
</p>
<p>available PEMFCs power, the difference will be supplied by discharging the UC, as
</p>
<p>long as it meets the SoC imposed restriction, namely to maintain it above 20%. The
</p>
<p>energy level stored in UC is considered sufficient to start the UC discharging as
</p>
<p>soon as SoC level reaches 50%. For 50% � SoC � 20%, the EMS commands
the PEMFCs power to go to the upper level and to continue the UC charging.
</p>
<p>If the set FC power level exceeds the load power needed, then the UC will be
</p>
<p>charged until it will become fully charged.

<p>13.3.3 NI Labview Software Development for Control
</p>
<p>and Monitoring of PEMFCs/UC-HPS
</p>
<p>Dedicated software has been developed in the NI Labview 2015 environment to
</p>
<p>control the test station operation and acquire experimental data. All DC/DC uni-
</p>
<p>directional converters (analog output and digital output) and mass flow controllers
</p>
<p>(hydrogen and air) are controlled by the software. The current, voltage and gas flow
</p>
<p>rates are measured. The software allows the visualization data in real time through a
</p>
<p>Graphical User Interface. All data is saved in a database at a frequency of 0.2 Hz.
</p>
<p>Figure 13.10 includes a screen shot of the test station software front panel along the
</p>
<p>location of the controls and indicators for each subsystem. The block diagram
</p>
<p>(Fig. 13.11) is a graphical representation of the monitoring and control software.
</p>
<p>13.4 Experimental Results
</p>
<p>Experimental tests were performed on a known load profile. This profile was
</p>
<p>implemented by programming an electronic load IT8518C (5 kW air cooled) profile
</p>
<p>consisting of 8 segments, which have been chosen so that, to have all cases the
</p>
<p>algorithm implemented EMS (Fig. 13.12). Thus, the segment 1 is the scroll for 15 s
</p>
<p>with a rated load of 1,200 W (zone 2 from the map efficiency FC); thereafter,
</p>
<p>accelerating the dP/dt 80 W/s variation power is passed in segment 2 (zone
</p>
<p>2 + zone 3), segment 3 there for 45 s at a constant power of 2,400 W (zone 3), then
</p>
<p>is passed in segment 4 with ascension in ramp to 3,100 W for 35 s (zone 3 and 4),
</p>
<p>the segment 5 is 50 s at a power of 3,100 W (Zone 4), the segment 6 is a ramp
</p>
<p>70 W/s. (Zone 4 and 5) for 10 s. At a power of 4,500 W until to the segment 7
</p>
<p>(Zone 5), then is passed in segment 8, which consists of a brake of 20 s. until to the
</p>
<p>power load equals zero (here through all the zones). The ultracapacitor&rsquo;s initial
</p>
<p>charge status is 76%, which was calculated by measuring the voltage UC in real
</p>
<p>time and dividing it by 56 V, the maximum voltage of the UC.
</p>
<p>The EMS algorithm was implemented in FPGA using method called &ldquo;state
</p>
<p>machine&rdquo;. For the segment 1, the EMS algorithm determined PEMFCs to operate in
</p>
<p>Zone 2, fueling PEMFCs with H2 = 23.5 SLPM and Air = 91.6 SLPM providing
</p>
<p>power 2000 W. Excess power is directed by controlling the DC/DC converter
</p>
<p>charging in UC. When is passed in segment 2, PEMFCs remains to Zone 2 until the
</p>
<p>power load exceeds the threshold of 2000 W, then it passes into zone 3. In Segment
</p>
<p>3 is observed as at a time, the ultracapacitor state of charge reaches 100%, at which
</p>
<p>point the routine is triggered, it passes in previous zone (Zone 2), the power
</p>
<p>difference to cover the load is made by controlling the discharge of DC/DC con-
</p>
<p>verter. The EMS algorithm passes through all segments correct profile, in the last
</p>
<p>segment when the load power goes under 1000 W to observe as PEMFCs remains
</p>
<p>in Zone 1 of operation so that the surplus power is charged in the ultracapacitor.

<p>By using this algorithm EMS it has been observed that PEMFCs works on
</p>
<p>different levels in stationary conditions prolonging the life of FC. The ultracapacitor
</p>
<p>is protected for SoC less than 20%. Through the operation of PEMFCs at maximum
</p>
<p>efficiency on the level of operation has achieved a reduction in fuel consumption of
</p>
<p>11.8%. Note that during load profile of 200 s the quantity of hydrogen consumed in

<p>13.5 Conclusions
</p>
<p>A new topology of HPS that consists in a PEM Fuel Cell stack (5 kW power) and a
</p>
<p>bank of ultracapacitors (130 F, 56 V, 57 Wh) was investigated in this chapter. It is
</p>
<p>used to meet the high power demand of the automotive applications, where the
</p>
<p>power demand fluctuates a lot. The PEMFCs operate in the flow-through mode
</p>
<p>fuelling and it is cooled with deionized water (65 &deg;C). The stack is fed with
</p>
<p>humidified hydrogen and air, at a stoichiometry of 1.25 and 2 respectively and the
</p>
<p>gases are controlled by two mass flow controllers.
</p>
<p>To protect the fuel cell against the power load fluctuations an EMS algorithm has
</p>
<p>been designed. This algorithm aims to direct the flow of power toward UC, when
</p>
<p>we have an excess of power from the PEMFCs, and vice versa, when the power
</p>
<p>produced by the PEMFC is not enough to take the power requirement from UC.
</p>
<p>The power flow is controlled using three DC/DC converters.
</p>
<p>The EMS algorithm was based on an FC efficiency map and on the UC state of
</p>
<p>charge. This algorithm was implemented in a main routine and five subroutines.
</p>
<p>The main routine split the load power in five equal zones (1000 W per one zone). It
</p>
<p>is aimed that in each area the fuel cell to operate at the point of maximum efficiency.
</p>
<p>This algorithm was implemented in a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
</p>
<p>system that utilizes the NI CompactRIO That 9082 platform, software developed in
</p>
<p>the NI Labview 2015.
</p>
<p>PEMFCs/UC HPS have been tested experimentally on a known load profile. The
</p>
<p>advantages of this new HPS topology are: extended lifetime of the PEMFCs by its
</p>
<p>operation in a stationary regime, protecting the state of UC Charge below 20% and
</p>
<p>reducing the consumption of hydrogen by 11.8% compared to a system without
</p>
<p>UC. This reduction in fuel consumption was due to PEMFCs operation in the areas
</p>
<p>with maximum efficiency.

</p>
<p>Abstract Ever increasing demand for electricity supply along with higher power
</p>
<p>quality and reliability, available fossil fuels restrictions and environmental pollu-
</p>
<p>tions led to aggregation of clean energy resources (distributed generations) and
</p>
<p>developing microgrids. Integration of distributed generations such as wind power
</p>
<p>and solar energy are challenging with various problems such as non-deterministic
</p>
<p>nature of available wind power and solar energy. On the other hand, power systems
</p>
<p>are subject to other uncertainties such as load and energy prices in day-ahead
</p>
<p>(DA) and balancing markets. Hence, intermittence could be highlighted as the main
</p>
<p>obstacle of distributed generations&rsquo; aggregation which cause to imbalance charges
</p>
<p>set by uncertain market prices and accordingly economic losses. To this end, a
</p>
<p>comprehensive study should be performed to elaborate aforementioned issues. In
</p>
<p>this chapter, a stochastic model with the goal of profit maximization and imbalance
</p>
<p>cost minimization is presented. Unlike previous works, in the proposed model all
</p>
<p>existent uncertainties related to wind power, solar energy, load, day ahead and
</p>
<p>imbalance market prices altogether are considered by the means of scenario based
</p>
<p>investigations. In order to generate probable scenarios, uncertain parameters should
</p>
<p>be predicted. In this framework, a new method based on neural network theory is
</p>
<p>proposed for predicting wind speed and solar radiation. Afterwards,
</p>
<p>pumped-storage plant and demand response program are utilized as two comple-
</p>
<p>mentary resources to compensate power imbalances. Storage devices are used as
</p>
<p>flexible resources to exchange power between low consumption&mdash;cheap hours and
</p>
<p>peak hours. Finally, to investigate efficiency of the proposed method two operating
</p>
<p>modes, namely coordinated and uncoordinated operation of clean energy resources,
</p>
<p>are assumed and testified on a test microgrid.

<p>14.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Recently, there is a strong attitude toward utilizing distributed generations (DGs) as
</p>
<p>the alternative to traditional ones. Distributed generations are small scale generation
</p>
<p>units such as small wind turbines (WTs), Photovoltaic (PV), fuel cells, and Micro
</p>
<p>turbines (MTs) which are installed close to the consumers [1]. Electricity cheap-
</p>
<p>ness, higher reliability and quality in providing power services and satisfying
</p>
<p>environmental concerns are the most important benefits of using DGs [2].
</p>
<p>By aggregation of distributed generations, loads and energy storage devices a
</p>
<p>microgrid (MG) is formed [3] which can be operated in a grid-connected or
</p>
<p>islanding mode. Since, the output voltage and frequency of DGs are not regulated
</p>
<p>and on the other hand, these power sources have stochastic nature, their output is in
</p>
<p>DC or unregulated Ac form. This makes it necessary to connect and control output
</p>
<p>power of distributed generation units via power electronic converters [4, 5].
</p>
<p>14 Integration and Management Technique &hellip; 395</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In the grid-connected mode, the main grid is responsible for regulating voltage
</p>
<p>and frequency of microgrid [6]. To reach this goal, the difference between generated
</p>
<p>and demanded power in the microgrid is calculated and then the main grid is
</p>
<p>responsible to hold balance in the microgrid. So, lack of main grid in islanding
</p>
<p>operating mode makes difficulties in microgrid control. The control method of
</p>
<p>microgrid in islanding mode should be able to regulate its voltage and frequency in
</p>
<p>order to maintain its dynamic stability at any time which can be performed by
</p>
<p>fast-response storage devices such as batteries. The second aim of microgrid con-
</p>
<p>trolling is to provide power balance between generation and consumption [7].
</p>
<p>Therefore, an efficient power management method is required to make the most
</p>
<p>appropriate decision for various conditions of power sources, demanded load,
</p>
<p>electricity price and many other circumstances.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, deregulation is new template of power industry which tries to
</p>
<p>reach a high level of competition between market participants, maximizing eco-
</p>
<p>nomic benefits, and also creating new options for consumers [8]. In deregulation
</p>
<p>template, electricity market price for each hour of future is determined by offers of
</p>
<p>consumers and power generators. By the way, because of non-deterministic nature
</p>
<p>of DGs, the amount of future generation for these units should be estimated by short
</p>
<p>term forecasting tools [9]. Various prediction methods have been presented in the
</p>
<p>literature such as artificial neural network [10], ANFIS [11] wavelet transform [12],
</p>
<p>Kalman filtering [13]. Also, researchers in [14] proposed a method to forecast two
</p>
<p>dependent parameters, load and market clearing price, simultaneously as a
</p>
<p>multi-input multi-output model.
</p>
<p>Taking into account deregulation rules, wind and solar power producers submit
</p>
<p>their offers to the market while they are unaware of their exact production level.
</p>
<p>This leads to generation of unbalances between scheduled and delivered energy
</p>
<p>which should be compensated in balancing markets [15]. Prior to introduction of
</p>
<p>MG, various studies have been performed about DGs. For instance, in [16] wind
</p>
<p>and photovoltaic generations for supplying an office building are designed in such a
</p>
<p>way that annual costs of the overall system are minimized and economical and
</p>
<p>environmental profits are maximized. The effects of distributed generations on
</p>
<p>expansion of sub-transmission system is studied in [17] and all of fixed and variable
</p>
<p>costs of DGs are considered in mathematical formulation. A mixed-integer math-
</p>
<p>ematical formulation is presented in [18] in order to determine the optimal offers of
</p>
<p>wind farm and storage unit in day-ahead market. In this formulation, market prices
</p>
<p>related to power imbalances are assumed to be known. Authors of [19] employed
</p>
<p>stochastic programming techniques to simulate participation of wind power and
</p>
<p>storage unit owners in day-ahead and ancillary service markets as an integrated
</p>
<p>self-schedule. Reference [20] proposed a new method to model wind power and
</p>
<p>storage unit while utilizing Value at Risk (VaR) of units to measure their operation.
</p>
<p>In [21] profit maximization and optimal bids for participation of wind farm and
</p>
<p>demand response are calculated. In the presented method marginal and imbalance
</p>
<p>prices are considered known and wind producer offering is improved by using
</p>
<p>demand response as a storing device.

<p>Research studies prove that independent utilization of DG units in power system
</p>
<p>can lead to lots of difficulties. So, in order to solve these problems, microgrid
</p>
<p>concept has been presented [22]. According to above claims, many researches have
</p>
<p>been carried out to identify different aspects of microgrids. Considering uncer-
</p>
<p>tainties related to wind speed, solar irradiance and load, reference [23], focuses on
</p>
<p>integration of DG units in a microgrid to reach maximum profit. In [24], microgrid
</p>
<p>planning is done in such a way to achieve the least amount of cost and emission. In
</p>
<p>[25] a novel coordinated bidding strategy is addressed to aggregate multiple DGs
</p>
<p>and storage units and demand response as an independent power producer in the
</p>
<p>microgrid in order to increase their revenue in intra-day market. Stochastic coor-
</p>
<p>dination of distributed resources considering related uncertainties in an islanding
</p>
<p>microgrid is studied in [26]. This paper takes into account intermittencies related to
</p>
<p>load, wind and solar generation by a set of probable scenarios. Authors of [27] have
</p>
<p>performed the optimal energy management for microgrid as a multi-objective
</p>
<p>problem while considering uncertain nature of wind and solar power. In this paper
</p>
<p>an incentive based demand response program is proposed to cover power uncer-
</p>
<p>tainties which makes it possible for various kinds of residential, commercial and
</p>
<p>industrial consumers to participate in demand response program. An energy man-
</p>
<p>agement system is suggested by [28] to determine the optimal operating point of
</p>
<p>wind turbines along with storage devices in a microgrid and minimize its cost and
</p>
<p>emissions while considering wind uncertainty. Reference [26] models operation of
</p>
<p>distributed energy sources in a microgrid as a stochastic mathematical model which
</p>
<p>utilizes various possible scenarios in order to cover load, wind and solar uncer-
</p>
<p>tainties. In [29], a matrix real coded genetic algorithm method is applied to optimize
</p>
<p>the operation of microgrid. In this study, energy storage system is used to manage
</p>
<p>uncertainties of PV.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, bidding strategy of microgrid components are discussed in detail
</p>
<p>and a scenario generation process based on prediction errors is utilized to cover
</p>
<p>existing uncertainties. Also demand response and pumped-storage are utilized as
</p>
<p>both storage device and power generator to adjust power imbalances.
</p>
<p>Comprehensive description of the issue is provided in the following sections.
</p>
<p>14.2 Problem Description
</p>
<p>In this section background knowledge related to the power markets and role of
</p>
<p>pumped-storage and demand response participation in power markets are discussed.
</p>
<p>14.2.1 Day-Ahead and Balancing Market
</p>
<p>The market considered in this chapter is composed of two sub-markets with distinct
</p>
<p>planning horizons which are named day-ahead (DA) and balancing market. Most of
</p>
<p>14 Integration and Management Technique &hellip; 397</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>power is exchanged in day-ahead markets. The basis of this market is auctions in
</p>
<p>which power producers and consumers propose their hourly offers based on final
</p>
<p>predictions before termination time which happens at 10:00 am and lasts for 15
</p>
<p>until 38 h. Finally by computing junction point of summated hourly demand and
</p>
<p>supply functions, the marginal clearing price (MCP) for each hour is calculated.
</p>
<p>This price is the minimum price which satisfies all purchase bids with enough
</p>
<p>accepted sell offers. The payment process in day-ahead market is to pay multipli-
</p>
<p>cation of real generation and marginal price for each hour.
</p>
<p>The wind and solar power producers must predict their future generation for next
</p>
<p>day in order to participate in day-ahead power market, however due to uncertain
</p>
<p>nature of wind and solar, always there are differences between predicted value and
</p>
<p>the real one. So in order to reduce imbalances between demand and generation
</p>
<p>power, balancing markets are employed in real time horizon. Power imbalances
</p>
<p>which can be calculated by subtraction of cleared generated power from real value,
</p>
<p>are settled and fined in balancing market. If there is overproduction, it will be
</p>
<p>settled cheaper than marginal price. Controversy, if there is underproduction, it will
</p>
<p>be compensated more expensive than marginal price. If pup;t and pdown;t represent
</p>
<p>the imbalance prices for excess and lack of produced power, respectively, it can be
</p>
<p>said that pup;t � pDA;t � pdown;t and the revenue earned from this market at time t is
calculated as below:
</p>
<p>R&eth;DP&THORN; &frac14;
pup;t PGen;t � PBid;t
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>if PGen;t �PBid;t
pdown;t PBid;t � PGen;t
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>if PGen;t\PBid;t
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>&eth;14:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>Here PGen;t and PBid;t represent the actual and submitted generation offer in
</p>
<p>day-ahead market, respectively. By supposing a&thorn;t � 1 and a
�
t � 1 as the ratio
</p>
<p>between sell and buy imbalance prices to marginal prices, imbalance prices can be
</p>
<p>computed as below:
</p>
<p>pup;t &frac14; a
&thorn;
t pDA;t; pdown;t &frac14; a
</p>
<p>�
t pDA;t &eth;14:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>By replacing Eq. (14.2) with Eq. (14.1), imbalance revenue is rewritten as
</p>
<p>below:
</p>
<p>R&eth;DP&THORN; &frac14;
a
&thorn;
t pDA;t PGen;t � PBid;t
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>if PGen;t �PBid;t
a
�
t pDA;t PBid;t � PGen;t
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>If PGen;t\PBid;t
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>&eth;14:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>14.2.2 Role of Pumped-Storage Unit
</p>
<p>The aim of power producers in construction of pumped-storage plant is to support
</p>
<p>uncertainty of wind and solar power generations and provide flexibility to power
</p>
<p>generators by this complementation. For example, suppose that wind or solar power
</p>
<p>producers face with an overproduction in real time operation, it means that the
</p>
<p>398 H. Shayeghi and E. Shahryari</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>generated power in real time is more than the power which they should provide. In
</p>
<p>this situation, the surplus power is saved by pumping water from bottom tank to the
</p>
<p>upper. Vice versa, if there is lack of generation, this shortage could be compensated
</p>
<p>by hydro turbine. In this condition, delivered power is accurate and equals to the
</p>
<p>cleared amount in market. However, it should be considered that this flexibility
</p>
<p>depends on the characteristics of pumped-storage unit, too.
</p>
<p>14.2.3 Role of Demand Response
</p>
<p>Demand response (DR) is a program which enables end-users to participate in
</p>
<p>electricity markets. In this procedure, consumers submit their demanded loads to the
</p>
<p>market. After clearing the day-ahead market, consumers are charged for their
</p>
<p>submitted bids and also the value of MCP and production of each generating unit is
</p>
<p>specified. This program enables end-users to propose their load reduction bids to
</p>
<p>the market and to be paid by MCP in the case of admission. Response of consumers
</p>
<p>to the market price is called elasticity. Higher amount of elasticity makes consumers
</p>
<p>to react well in response to power price changes. So when the electricity price is
</p>
<p>high, consumers can adjust themselves by reducing consumption.
</p>
<p>Coordinated operation of DR and clean energy sources like wind and solar
</p>
<p>power, could cover uncertainties of wind and solar. For example, in peak hours
</p>
<p>consumers can decrease their consumption and compensate uncertainty of wind
</p>
<p>power and photovoltaic. On the other hand, applying flexible load helps in
</p>
<p>improving welfare of power producers and minimizing the penalties that they
</p>
<p>should pay to imbalance market resultant from their uncertain nature.
</p>
<p>The overall process of this chapter to aggregate clean energy sources in a
</p>
<p>microgrid is depicted in Fig. 14.1 which shows the total stages step by step.
</p>
<p>14.3 Modelling Uncertainties
</p>
<p>A situation in which there is lack of accurate and detailed information about present or
</p>
<p>future conditions is called uncertainty. Power systems confront with two main types
</p>
<p>of uncertainties which caused by failure of generation units or by prediction errors.
</p>
<p>Failure of generation units leads to lack of production which can be compensated via
</p>
<p>spinning or non-spinning reserves; but uncertainties related to prediction accuracy is
</p>
<p>consisted of load, produced power and market price uncertainties for each hour of
</p>
<p>next day. In this chapter second type of uncertainties is studied which can be con-
</p>
<p>trolled with stochastic programming techniques. In this method, aforementioned
</p>
<p>uncertain parameters must be predicted at first, then a scenario generation process
</p>
<p>based on prediction error is utilized to generate probable values of stochastic
</p>
<p>parameters. Finally, in order to speed up computation a scenario reduction technique
</p>
<p>is employed. Each of these steps are explained in detail as follows.

<p>14.3.1 Prediction Method
</p>
<p>This chapter proposes a new technique for short term prediction of uncertain
</p>
<p>parameters based on neural network (NN). NN is a nonlinear modeling technique
</p>
<p>which is trained by historical data to specify the relation between input and output
</p>
<p>data. In this chapter, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with one hidden
</p>
<p>layer is utilized to do forecasting. MLP networks are composed of three layers
</p>
<p>named as input, hidden and output layer that are connected to each other linearly
</p>
<p>through connection weights. Consider W1 &frac14; w1ij&eth;n&THORN;

</p>
<p>and W2 &frac14; w2jk&eth;n&THORN;

<p>weight matrixes which are used to link neurons of input layer to hidden ones and
</p>
<p>relate hidden layer neurons to the output one, respectively.
</p>
<p>In order to convert output values of neurons to nonlinear ones, sigmoid function
</p>
<p>is utilized as activation function which is defined below:

<p>Here, n and k denote the number of training pattern and output neurons,
</p>
<p>respectively. Finally, moving in a backward direction, from output layer to input
</p>
<p>one, connection weights are modified in such a way to minimize MSE value.
</p>
<p>In the presented method a new combination of last three years&rsquo;wind speed data of
</p>
<p>Sotavento wind farm in Spain [30] is used for training MLP neural network. The
</p>
<p>important property of learning data is that other historical parameters such as
</p>
<p>pressure or temperature are not considered but the earning results were accurate
</p>
<p>enough. In the presented combination, data for each season is used as training data of
</p>
<p>that season. Totally there would be 75 inputs and 24 outputs. The input signals are
</p>
<p>24-h wind speed of a day before prediction day, wind speed data for 24 h of the
</p>
<p>prediction day in the previous week, wind speed for all hours of prediction day in
</p>
<p>two weeks ago and the mean, maximum and minimum value of wind speed for
</p>
<p>prediction day that these last three input values are collected from weather prediction
</p>
<p>station. The output values are the 24-h wind speed of the desired prediction day.
</p>
<p>To choose the best number for hidden layer neurons which has the least training
</p>
<p>error, neuron number in hidden layer are changed from 1 to 10 and proportional
</p>
<p>training error value is calculated for each one. Figure 14.2 depicts the proportionate
</p>
<p>training error for each number. As can be seen, 9 neurons have the least error value
</p>
<p>and it is chosen as the best neuron number of hidden layer. Neural network
</p>
<p>parameters are expressed in Table 14.1.

<p>14.3.2 Scenario Generation Technique
</p>
<p>Step 1. First of all, all uncertain parameters are forecasted for each hour of a
</p>
<p>1 month period before bidding time.
</p>
<p>Step 2. By comparing the prediction values and actual ones for the respective
</p>
<p>month, hourly error values of prediction is calculated as below:

<p>Errort &frac14;
Actualt � Forecastt
</p>
<p>Actualt
� 100 &eth;14:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>where here Actualt and Forecastt symbolize the real and forecasted values
</p>
<p>of uncertain parameter at hour t in the respective month.
</p>
<p>Step 3. The resulting error values proportional to each hour are classified in 1%
</p>
<p>distances while each class symbolizes a probable scenario. By dividing the
</p>
<p>frequency of each class to total month hours, occurrence probability of
</p>
<p>each error value is computed.
</p>
<p>Step 4. In this step, the probability of categories are normalized in such a way that
</p>
<p>their total sum equals to unity. Afterward, a cumulative normalized
</p>
<p>probability is assigned to each category as shown in Fig. 14.4.
</p>
<p>Step 5. Existence of multiple categories with various probabilities led to employ
</p>
<p>Roulette Wheel mechanism in order to generate favorite number of
</p>
<p>scenarios (here 10) for each hour. In this mechanism, a number is
</p>
<p>generated between 0 and 1, randomly and then it is compared with sorted
</p>
<p>categories. First category with cumulative probability equal or greater than
</p>
<p>random value, is selected.
</p>
<p>Step 6. Now all of uncertain parameters are predicted for next 24 h, bidding
</p>
<p>interval, and the proportion value of each scenario is calculated as below:
</p>
<p>UPS;t &frac14; Pt &thorn;ErrorS � Pt &eth;14:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>where UPS;t, Pt and ErrorS symbolize the uncertain parameter in Sth
</p>
<p>scenario and rth hour, predicted value in hour t and prediction error in Sth
</p>
<p>scenario respectively.
</p>
<p>Step 7. Finally, after generating desired number of scenarios, occurrence prob-
</p>
<p>ability of each scenario is calculated as below:

<p>14.3.3 Scenario Reduction Technique
</p>
<p>The aim of scenario reduction technique is to speed up optimization process. That is
</p>
<p>why in this technique some of scenarios similar to each other or the ones with very
</p>
<p>small probability of occurrence, have been omitted. Although a higher number of
</p>
<p>scenarios along with a higher computational burden can result in an accurate
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>modeling of the uncertainty, but a proper scenario reduction method can also
</p>
<p>approximate system&rsquo;s uncertain behavior efficiently. Consider S as the total set of
</p>
<p>scenarios, here 105, which are generated in the scenario generation process. DS
</p>
<p>symbolize the scenarios that should be omitted and is initially null. Also initialize
</p>
<p>ND as the desired number of scenarios after reduction process. This steps of
</p>
<p>aforementioned scenario reduction process is as below:
</p>
<p>Step 1. First of all, calculate the distance of all scenarios, two by two as below:

</p>
<p>Step 2. For each scenario k, find the scenario r with least distance from scenario
</p>
<p>k as formulated below:
</p>
<p>DTk;r &frac14; min&eth;DTk;S0&THORN; &eth;14:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>Step 3 Calculate amount of pS � DTk;r and elect scenario d which has the
minimum production value. The election process results in selection of a
</p>
<p>scenario which has the least probability of occurrence and the most
</p>
<p>similarity to other scenarios simultaneously.
</p>
<p>Step 4. Omit the selected scenario, S &frac14; S� dgf and add it to omissions category,
DS &frac14; DS&thorn; dgf and also occurrence probability of d is added to its similar
scenario r, pr &frac14; pr &thorn; pd .
</p>
<p>Step 5. If the favorable number of scenarios are not omitted reached, go to Step 2.
</p>
<p>Flow chart of the explained scenario reduction process is depicted in Fig. 14.7.

<p>14.4 Mathematical Modelling of Clean Energy Sources
</p>
<p>The next subsections present detailed optimization formulation of abovementioned
</p>
<p>configurations. Each of these models makes effort to maximize its welfare and
</p>
<p>minimize unbalanced costs. It is worth mentioning that all equations are expressed
</p>
<p>in hourly intervals.
</p>
<p>14.4.1 Disjoint Operation (DO)
</p>
<p>In this operating mode, each of energy sources participate independently in power
</p>
<p>markets while aim to maximize their own income. In this mode, utilities sell their
</p>
<p>produced power to spot markets and compensate their unbalances in imbalance
</p>
<p>market. So the total income function is composed of earnings from selling power to
</p>
<p>406 H. Shayeghi and E. Shahryari</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>day-ahead markets plus revenues from imbalance market when facing with surplus
</p>
<p>production minus penalties costs to compensate lack of committed power in
</p>
<p>imbalanced market. Welfare function related to each clean energy source along with
</p>
<p>considering its own technical constraints are formulated as below.
</p>
<p>14.4.1.1 Wind Power Producer
</p>
<p>Considering probable nature of available wind power, wind power producer
</p>
<p>(WPP) participate in power markets based on predicted values in scenarios but as
</p>
<p>mentioned above, scenarios are generated by forecasted wind speed values. So in
</p>
<p>order to make it possible to participate in power markets, these speed amounts must
</p>
<p>be converted to power. The relation between wind speed and power is as follow [23]:

</p>
<p>utilized as wind turbine power curve to transform wind speed into power.

<p>14.4.1.2 Photovoltaic
</p>
<p>Similar to wind power, hourly available solar energy confront with uncertainties.
</p>
<p>To manage this stochastic nature, probable solar radiation for each hour was
</p>
<p>forecasted in previous section. Now in order to calculate available solar energy,
</p>
<p>radiation must be converted to energy via underneath equation [22]:
</p>
<p>PPV = Apvx
2 + Bpvx &eth;14:22&THORN;
</p>
<p>While, x symbolizes the solar radiation (W/m2), PPV signifies the available solar
</p>
<p>power and Apv and Bpv are constants which are equal to 2 and 3.6, respectively and
</p>
<p>are derived from radiation curve which is illustrated in Fig. 14.9.
</p>
<p>Formulating profit function of photovoltaic arrays are similar to wind power
</p>
<p>producer and their both production is cost free. So, considering uncertainties of solar
</p>
<p>radiation and market prices, the profit function is contained of three terms as below:
</p>
<p>FPV &frac14; FDA &thorn;FPos Im b � FNeg Im b &eth;14:23&THORN;

<p>14.4.1.4 Pumped-Storage Unit
</p>
<p>As a storage unit, pumped-storage plant conserves electricity power within low
</p>
<p>consumption and cheap hours by pumping water into top tank and releases this
</p>
<p>energy when it is needed by turbine. This process matches network delivered power
</p>
<p>to the cleared value with high accuracy.
</p>
<p>The expected income of participating pumped-storage unit in power markets is a
</p>
<p>function of selling power g
Pump

</p>
<p>Pump
t;S from, the market while
</p>
<p>considering CSu and CSd as the pumping start-up and close down expenses and also
</p>
<p>two terms to cover shortage or surplus of power in balancing market. All of these
</p>
<p>functions are expressed in Eq. (14.37). Here FDA, FSu, FSd , FPos Im b and FNeg Im b
represent the income function in DA market, start-up and close down expenses and
</p>
<p>income and penalty in imbalance markets, respectively. Each of them are expressed

<p>14.5 Simulation Results
</p>
<p>In this part of chapter, numerical studies have been done in order to analyze joint
</p>
<p>and disjoint operation of clean energy sources and to determine bids and benefits of
</p>
<p>each configuration. To do so a test system which is composed of all these clean
</p>
<p>energy sources is considered. The proposed method has a MILP nature which is
</p>
<p>solved by CPLEX solver of GAMS software. The numerical results has been
</p>
<p>performed on a 2.3-GHz based processor with 4 GB of RAM.
</p>
<p>14.5.1 Studied System
</p>
<p>The schematic diagram of studied system is shown in Fig. 14.10. The case study
</p>
<p>system is composed of a 2500 kW wind turbine, solar resource with nominal power
</p>
<p>of 300 kW and two pumped-storage units with 300 and 100 kW storage and
</p>
<p>generation capacity, respectively. The wind speed data of Sotavento wind farm in
</p>
<p>Spain [30] is employed. In this chapter, annual solar radiation of Madrid, Spain
</p>
<p>which is freely available for public in SAM website [32] is utilized. The MCP is
</p>
<p>extracted from Spanish electricity market [33]. The case study is simulated for 10
</p>
<p>February 2014. Table 14.2 shows the parameters of storage units. The start-up cost
</p>
<p>for each unit is equal to Csu &frac14; 100$ while the close down expense is assumed to be
10$. The basic values of demand response program parameters are given in
</p>
<p>Table 14.3. Also, overall scenarios are reduced to 1000 by the aforementioned
</p>
<p>scenario reduction process.
</p>
<p>14.5.2 Numerical Results
</p>
<p>In this section the abovementioned method for integration of DGs is applied on a
</p>
<p>typical microgrid and numerical results are extracted. First of all it is necessary to
</p>
<p>model uncertainties and generate required scenarios. In order to analyze behavior of
</p>
<p>414 H. Shayeghi and E. Shahryari</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>imbalance market prices, hourly buy and sell imbalance prices and also hourly
</p>
<p>MCP values throughout January is extracted from [33]. Then by dividing extracted
</p>
<p>imbalance prices to their proportional MCP value, their hurly ratios are computed.
</p>
<p>In this chapter in order to demonstrate the occurrence number of ratios, box plot for
</p>
<p>ratios of buy and sell imbalance prices is depicted in Fig. 14.11. Selling power in
</p>
<p>imbalance market occurs when there is a surplus generated power with respect to
</p>
<p>the commitment. Excess of generated power will be sold cheaper than MCP and sell
</p>
<p>imbalance price ratio will be lower than unity as shown in Fig. 14.11a. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, buying imbalance power results from shortage of produced power with
</p>
<p>respect to the promised value. So it clear that this deficiency will be traded in a
</p>
<p>higher price than MCP and as can be seen in Fig. 14.11b buy imbalance price ratios
</p>
<p>will be greater than unity. Each of these buy and sell ratios are a probable scenario
</p>
<p>which can be happened.

<p>Happening probability of each these scenarios is calculated by dividing its
</p>
<p>number of occurrences to the total hours of month which equals to 720. At this
</p>
<p>point, required number of buy and sell imbalance price ratio scenarios (here 10 for
</p>
<p>each one) are generated by roulette wheel mechanism. Figure 14.12 shows the real
</p>
<p>and forecasted values of wind speed, solar radiation, MCP and load. As can be seen
</p>
<p>the prediction results are not accurate completely and there is a prediction error for
</p>
<p>most of the hours between real and forecasted values.
</p>
<p>These error values are categorized in 1% distances for each uncertain parameter
</p>
<p>while each of these categories is considered as a probable scenario. Same as above,
</p>
<p>occurrence probability of each error value is computed by dividing its abundance to
</p>

<p>total number of error values. Roulette wheel mechanism is applied to generate
</p>
<p>desired number of scenarios (here 10) for each uncertain parameter. Ten generated
</p>
<p>scenarios for each of six uncertain parameters are depicted in Fig. 14.13.
</p>
<p>The aim of optimization models is to find optimal bidding values for next day in
</p>
<p>such a way that the social welfare is maximized. In this chapter in order to explain
</p>
<p>effects of uncertainties on earned profit, optimization is done on two configurations
</p>
<p>named as disjoint and joint operation. In disjoint configuration, each of microgrid
</p>
<p>elements bid independently to maximize their own profit but in the joint operation,
</p>
<p>all of microgrid elements suggest their offers to the market by considering effects of
</p>
<p>other participants to reach the maximum profit of microgrid. Figure 14.14 depicts
</p>
<p>the optimal bidding values for each hour in these two configurations. In disjoint
</p>
<p>configuration WPP and PV offer based on their available power. As Fig. 14.14
</p>
<p>shows PV offers only for hours between 10 till 17 while solar radiation is nonzero.
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.13 Generated scenarios for: a solar radiation, b wind speed, c demanded load, d marginal

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Also demand response and pumped storage unit bid based on load and MCP. For
</p>
<p>example during 11 till 16 when MCP and load are high, demand response program
</p>
<p>submit its bid to reduce load but between 16 till 19 when MCP is low, it will
</p>
<p>compensate the reduced loads. On the other hand, pumped-storage unit pumps
</p>
<p>water between 1 and 8 while demanded load and MCP are low and release this
</p>
<p>energy at 11 when load is high.
</p>
<p>By comparing the joint and disjoint operation results, it can be seen that offered
</p>
<p>power in joint mode during expensive hours is more than summation of units&rsquo;
</p>
<p>individual offers because of flexibility which arises from pumped-storage plant and
</p>
<p>demand response. On the other words, during off peak and cheap hours when WPP
</p>
<p>and PV&rsquo;s output power is high, pumped-storage unit acts in pumping mode to store
</p>
<p>energy. To do so, it buys inexpensive power and pumps water to the upper tank in
</p>
<p>order to save energy. The stored energy is sold to earn much profit during expensive
</p>
<p>hours or to reduce penalties when WPP and PV producers face with lack of gen-
</p>
<p>erated power because of their uncertain nature. Also, end users help this flexibility by
</p>
<p>reducing their demand during expensive hours and compensate them in cheap hours.
</p>
<p>Numerical results related to the expected profit for each configuration is
</p>
<p>expressed in Table 14.4. WPP, PV producer, pumped-storage units and DR pro-
</p>
<p>gram earn 1663.332$, 195.957$, 367.526$ and 120$ profit when they try inde-
</p>
<p>pendently to maximize just their own profit whose summation equals to 2346.812$.
</p>
<p>But in the joint mode, integration of all units together increases overall flexibility
</p>
<p>against existence uncertainties which lead to an overall profit which equals to
</p>
<p>2556.492$. Simulation results approve that aggregating all sources together was
</p>
<p>successful in increasing the profit by 8.9% in the case study.
</p>
<p>This profit increase in joint mode results from hedging against solar and wind
</p>
<p>production uncertainty which is provided by pumped-storage unit and demand
</p>
<p>response via pumping water to upper reservoir and saving energy during cheap
</p>
<p>hours and releasing water and generating energy during expensive hours or by
</p>
<p>reducing consumption in costly hours and buying it in inexpensive hours.

<p>Figure 14.15 depicts the operation of upper reservoir of pumped-storage unit for
</p>
<p>each hour and scenario in the joint configuration. As can be seen during inex-
</p>
<p>pensive hours, off-peak hours, the reservoir pumps water to its upper tank until it
</p>
<p>reaches to its upper reservoir limitation which equals to 1500 kW. Then in
</p>
<p>expensive hours it releases this energy to avoid economic losses. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>this figure proves that the initial and final value of stored energy in this reservoir
</p>
<p>equals to 900 kW which was constrained in the mathematical modeling of pumped
</p>
<p>storage unit.
</p>
<p>14.6 Conclusion
</p>
<p>Through this chapter, a scenario based stochastic method is proposed for planning
</p>
<p>the aggregated operation of wind turbine, photovoltaic arrays, pumped-storage unit
</p>
<p>and demand response with the goal of profit maximization. The proposed strategy
</p>
<p>considers uncertainties related to wind power, solar radiation, load, marginal and
</p>
<p>imbalance market prices over the 24 h study horizon. Using neural networks,
</p>
<p>uncertain variables are forecasted and then according to prediction errors, possible
</p>
<p>scenarios are generated and the proportional occurrence probability of each scenario
</p>
<p>is calculated. In order to save computation time, a backward scenario reduction
</p>
<p>process is applied.

<p>The proposed four-stage-scenario-based method is tested on a typical microgrid
</p>
<p>for various operating circumstances. Numerical results approve that aggregation of
</p>
<p>all units in a microgrid can significantly increase profit value in comparison to units
</p>
<p>disjoint operation. The results also approve that, demand response and
</p>
<p>pumped-storage plant as storage devices can efficiently cover production power
</p>
<p>uncertainties of microgrid units and make wind and solar producers more com-

<p>Optimal Planning of a Micro-combined

<p>Cooling, Heating and Power System Using

<p>Air-Source Heat Pumps for Residential

<p>Buildings

</p>
<p>Abstract This chapter explains a methodology for optimal planning of a
</p>
<p>micro-combined cooling, heating and power system driven by a solar dish Stirling
</p>
<p>heat engine. The solar dish concentrator collects the sun radiations and transforms
</p>
<p>them into thermal energy. The absorber and thermal storage systems are employed
</p>
<p>to absorb and store the thermal energy collected by a solar dish for continuous
</p>
<p>energy supplying when the sunlight is insufficient. The solar energy is absorbed and
</p>
<p>transferred to the working fluid in the hot point of the Stirling engine. The air source
</p>
<p>heat pump has been proposed to cool and heat the residential buildings in hot and
</p>
<p>cold weather conditions, respectively. During a hot weather, the air to air heat pump
</p>
<p>receives heat from the inside air and transfers it into the outside air, and vice versa
</p>
<p>in a cold climate. The heating energy obtained from air source heat pumps is not
</p>
<p>generated by a combustion process, rather it is transferred from the inside air to the
</p>
<p>outside air. Hence, the most promising aspect of the proposed micro-combined
</p>
<p>cooling, heating and power system is that it can be solar driven and transfer heat
</p>
<p>from the inside air during summer. Note that the process is reversed in winter times.
</p>
<p>Due to the increasing rate of carbon dioxide and more attention paid to the
</p>
<p>greenhouse gas emissions, use of solar energy and air source heat pumps in a
</p>
<p>micro-trigeneration system, which does not use any fossil fuel such as gasoline or
</p>
<p>natural gas, not only gives more chances to significant reduction of carbon dioxide,
</p>
<p>greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental pollution, but also increases the
</p>
<p>economic saving in fuel consumption. In an air to air heat pump, the electricity

<p>15.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In recent years, the urgent need to meet the increased power demand and to address
</p>
<p>the concerns over the environmental pollution as well as the greenhouse gas
</p>
<p>emissions reduction have led to employment of the tri-generation technology
</p>
<p>powered by renewable energy sources. The combined cooling, heating and power
</p>
<p>(CCHP) systems not only provide the cooling, heating and electricity demands of
</p>
<p>different customers such as residential, commercial and industrial loads, but also
</p>
<p>can provide reserve, peak saving and demand response services. As shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.1, a typical tri-generation system consists of the following main
</p>
<p>components:
</p>
<p>&bull; Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric energy, biomass,
</p>
<p>hydrogen and fuel cells, and geothermal power.
</p>
<p>&bull; Prime mover such as reciprocating internal combustion engine, combustion
</p>
<p>turbine, steam turbine, micro turbine, gas turbine, fuel cell, and Stirling engine
</p>
<p>as an external combustion engine.

</p>
<p>Recently, several remarkable researches have been carried out to plan and
</p>
<p>evaluate a tri-generation system. In [1], a novel energy management strategy based
</p>
<p>on the variational electric cooling with combined electric and absorption chillers
</p>
<p>under unlimited and limited power generation unit capacity has been proposed. The
</p>
<p>variational electric cooling to cool load ratio has been optimized according to
</p>
<p>electric and thermal demands in every hour. In [2], a multi-objective optimization of
</p>
<p>a CCHP microgrid driven by solar energy has been investigated. The flat-plate solar
</p>
<p>collectors have been employed to collect the sun beam radiations and transform
</p>
<p>them into thermal energy. The heat storage system has been installed to store the
</p>
<p>collected thermal energy. Turbine inlet temperature, turbine inlet pressure, con-

<p>been selected as the optimization decision variables to assess the performance of the
</p>
<p>entire solar CCHP microsystem. A two-stage optimal planning of tri-generation
</p>
<p>microgrid has been investigated in [3]. Total net present cost and carbon dioxide
</p>
<p>emission in life circle have simultaneously been minimized using non-dominated
</p>
<p>sorting genetic algorithm-II and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) algo-
</p>
<p>rithm. In [4], exergoeconomic optimization of a CCHP system has been applied to
</p>
<p>maximize the total revenue requirement and the cost of the total system product
</p>
<p>using a genetic algorithm. Air compressor pressure ratio, gas turbine inlet tem-
</p>
<p>perature, pinch point temperatures in dual pressure heat recovery steam generator,
</p>
<p>pressure of the steam that enters the generator of the absorption chiller, process
</p>
<p>steam pressure and evaporator of the absorption chiller chilled water outlet tem-
</p>
<p>perature have been chosen as decision variables.
</p>
<p>Reference [5] considers exergy modeling of a solar powered CCHP system
</p>
<p>consists of a single-effect absorption chiller, a heat exchanger, thermal storage tank,
</p>
<p>evaporator, absorber, solution expansion valve, solution pump, desorber, con-
</p>
<p>denser, and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) components. Three operating conditions
</p>
<p>have been considered in this study: low solar radiation, high solar radiation, and
</p>
<p>storage mode in night. A real-time model of hydrogen tri-generation system and
</p>
<p>onsite hydrogen dispensing systems in the presence of price and market uncer-
</p>
<p>tainties has been developed in [6]. Application of two multi criteria
</p>
<p>decision-making algorithms denoted as fuzzy logic and the grey incidence methods
</p>
<p>are discussed in [7] to select the best prime mover for a residential tri-generation
</p>
<p>microgrid under five different climates. Technological, economic, environmental
</p>
<p>and social have been considered in the optimization process. Reference [8] intro-
</p>
<p>duces a novel CCHP system including a low temperature polymer electrolyte fuel
</p>
<p>cell and a desiccant wheel-based air handling unit. An integrated solid oxide fuel
</p>
<p>cell (SOFC) cogeneration micro-grid, fueled by coke oven gas that needs large
</p>
<p>amount of hydrogen is developed in [9]. Exhaust gas deep-recovery and thermo-
</p>
<p>electric generator based tri-generation system is presented in [10]. Thermoelectric
</p>
<p>generator and condenser are used to efficiently recover the exhaust gas waste heat of
</p>
<p>internal combustion engine. In [11], a small-scale solar tri-generation cycle com-
</p>
<p>bined with ORC has been proposed for hot and cold weather conditions. Turbine
</p>
<p>inlet temperature and pressure, turbine back pressure, evaporator temperature and
</p>
<p>heater outlet temperature are selected as the decision variables to improve thermal
</p>
<p>efficiency, exergy efficiency and total product cost rate. The proposed system could
</p>
<p>continuously and stably operate with installed thermal storage tank.
</p>
<p>A novel CCHP microgrid with significant economic and environmental benefits,
</p>
<p>which consists of a power generation unit, an absorption chiller, two ground source
</p>
<p>heat pumps, a storage tank and two electric chillers has been introduced in [12]. The
</p>
<p>hourly programming with different cooling and heating demands has been carried
</p>
<p>out according to the outdoor climatic condition to improve system efficiency. In
</p>
<p>[13], a biomass tri-generation microgrid including a biomass gasifier, a heat pipe
</p>
<p>heat exchanger, an internal combustion engine, an absorption chiller and a heater
</p>
<p>for cooling and heating, and a heat exchanger to produce domestic hot water has
</p>
<p>been proposed. Operational planning has been provided in three modes: summer,

<p>winter, and the transient seasons. In [14], a novel micro-CCHP equipped with
</p>
<p>20 kW Lombardini diesel engine and a double effect water-LiBr absorption chiller
</p>
<p>has been introduced to generate hot water, by recovering heat from the engine
</p>
<p>cooling system, and chilled water, by recovering heat from the engine exhaust
</p>
<p>gasses. The engine and the absorption chiller have been modeled by means of 0&ndash;1D
</p>
<p>dimensional and thermochemical models, respectively. A Honda gas engine based
</p>
<p>micro-CCHP, which utilizes a heat recovery system, has been proposed to satisfy
</p>
<p>the required heating, cooling and electrical energy of a residential building
</p>
<p>according to the air conditions [15]. The formulation of a CCHP system including
</p>
<p>an air-conditioning system and a heat storage tank in residential and office buildings
</p>
<p>in Dalian, China is presented in [16]. The energy saving, total cost, and environ-
</p>
<p>mental pollution reduction have been considered as main objectives in the genetic
</p>
<p>based optimization process. In [17], a small scale CCHP system has been intro-
</p>
<p>duced. The waste heat of internal combustion engine is collected and managed
</p>
<p>using a thermal management controller. The waste heat can be used for heating or
</p>
<p>cooling cycle. The part load ratio of the internal combustion engine, buffer tank set
</p>
<p>point temperature, hot water tank set point temperature, chilled water temperature
</p>
<p>and cooling water temperature of adsorption chiller are treated as decision variables.
</p>
<p>Thermal management controller is used to manage the waste heat. The heating
</p>
<p>output of the thermal management controller is regulated via buffer tank and hot
</p>
<p>water tank set point temperatures. A CCHP microgrid with a gas turbine, a heat
</p>
<p>recovery steam generator unit and an absorption heat pump driven by a steam
</p>
<p>turbine has been designed in [18]. Genetic algorithm is used to minimize the total
</p>
<p>annual cost and maximize the exergy efficiency. In [19], a reliable grassroots
</p>
<p>biomass based cogeneration system has been designed according to the equipment
</p>
<p>redundancy. Chance constrained programming and k-out-of-m system modeling
</p>
<p>have been applied to solve a multi period optimization process.
</p>
<p>A tri-generation system including a solid oxide fuel cell, an air pre-heater, an
</p>
<p>ethanol reformer, a steam generator and a double-effect LiBr/H2O absorption
</p>
<p>chiller, which uses the heat recovery of the solid oxide fuel cell exhaust gas, has
</p>
<p>been proposed in [20]. In order to evaluate the performance of the presented
</p>
<p>microgrid, a parametric assessment of the effects of the current density, solid oxide
</p>
<p>fuel cell temperature, fuel consumption ratio and solid oxide fuel cell anode
</p>
<p>recirculation ratio variations on total net electrical, heating and cooling energies
</p>
<p>have been provided. An energy management strategy has been proposed to increase
</p>
<p>the biomass-CCHP yearly efficiency by managing the output heating energy [21],
</p>
<p>where double piping district heating and cooling demands of a residential building
</p>
<p>have been considered. In the maximization process of the net present value, hourly
</p>
<p>heating and cooling load have been forecasted using the degree-hour method.

<p>Energy and exergy based management of a three-reactor chemical looping hydro-

</p>
<p>gasification unit, a chemical looping hydrogen generation system, an extended heat

<p>management in energy hubs has recently attracted a great deal of attention around
</p>
<p>the world. The energy hub consists of several inputs (energy resources) and outputs
</p>
<p>(energy consumptions) and also some energy conversion/storage devices. The
</p>
<p>energy hub can be a home, large consumer, power plant, etc. The objective is to
</p>
<p>minimize the energy procurement costs (fuel/electricity/environmental aspects)
</p>
<p>subject to a set of technical constraints. In [23], a comprehensive multi-objective
</p>
<p>model is proposed to minimize both the energy procurement cost and risk level in
</p>
<p>energy hub. For controlling the pernicious effects of the uncertainties, conditional
</p>
<p>value at risk (CVaR) is used as risk management tool. A novel time varying
</p>
<p>acceleration coefficients particle swarm optimization (TVAC-PSO) algorithm is
</p>
<p>implemented to solve combined heat and power economic dispatch problem in [24].
</p>
<p>To achieve a practical planning of CCHP microgrids with no combustion pro-
</p>
<p>cess and no emission of potentially dangerous gases, high economic and techno-
</p>
<p>logical efficiency are difficult challenges to be addressed. In the literature,
</p>
<p>remarkable efforts have been made to manage on the energy and exergy of
</p>
<p>tri-generation systems. However, some problems have not been resolved yet.
</p>
<p>Among those are the significant reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions and the
</p>
<p>risk of the environmental pollutants, reducing the fossil fuel consumption using
</p>
<p>renewable energy sources, and economic savings due to energy exchanges with the
</p>
<p>main grid. This chapter develops an hourly scheduling of a novel micro
</p>
<p>tri-generation system to satisfy the electrical, heating and cooling demands of a
</p>
<p>residential building. A solar dish Stirling heat engine (SDSHE) is used as the prime
</p>
<p>mover to provide the required input mechanical power for the power generation
</p>
<p>unit. Thus, there is no need for a combustion process, fossil fuel consumption or
</p>
<p>equipment in the combustion process such as a combustion chamber, an air com-
</p>
<p>pressor and a gas turbine. Therefore, there will be no greenhouse gas emissions
</p>
<p>involved. The proposed small-scale CCHP system is designed to operate in two
</p>
<p>different modes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Combined heat and power (CHP) mode based on the heating cycle of the air to
</p>
<p>air heat pump (AAHP) in the cold weather.
</p>
<p>&bull; Combined cool and power (CCP) mode based on the refrigeration cycle of the
</p>
<p>air to air heat pump on hot days.
</p>
<p>The electric chiller is also used to supply a part of the required cold energy in the
</p>
<p>cooling mode. Furthermore, the proposed air to air heat pump based small-scale
</p>
<p>CCHP microgrid has the following advantages:
</p>
<p>&bull; Air to air heat pumps can provide cooling energy in hot climate condition, and
</p>
<p>vice versa.
</p>
<p>&bull; Air to air heat pumps requires less maintenance than the combustion process
</p>
<p>based heating systems.
</p>
<p>&bull; Similar to the SDSHE, air to air heat pumps are safe. No combustion or
</p>
<p>emission is involved.
</p>
<p>428 F. Jabari et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Air to air heat pumps save carbon emissions. Unlike the burning oil, gas, and
</p>
<p>biomass, an air to air heat pump produces no carbon emissions on site (no
</p>
<p>greenhouse gas emissions at all, if a renewable source of electricity such as solar
</p>
<p>or wind is used to power them).
</p>
<p>&bull; Air to air heat pumps are cheaper to run than the oil boilers and can be cheaper
</p>
<p>than the running gas boilers.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Sect. 15.2 expresses the
</p>
<p>basic concepts related to the solar powered Stirling heat engine and the refrigeration
</p>
<p>cycle of the air source heat pumps. The energy and the exergy of the proposed
</p>
<p>micro-combined cooling, heating and power system are analyzed in Sect. 15.3.
</p>
<p>Simulation results and discussions are presented in Sect. 15.4. Finally, Sect. 15.5
</p>
<p>concludes the chapter.

<p>15.2.1 Solar Dish Stirling Heat Engine (SDSHE)
</p>
<p>In this chapter, the solar energy is used as a renewable energy source to drive a
</p>
<p>Stirling engine, which is used to supply the primary mechanical power required for
</p>
<p>a power generation unit [25]. The location of an absorber and a thermal storage unit
</p>
<p>on a solar-dish concentrator are illustrated in Fig. 15.2.
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 15.3, the Stirling cycle comprises of four processes. Process
</p>
<p>1&ndash;2 is an isothermal process, in which the working fluid after compressing at
</p>
<p>constant temperature Tc and rejected heat to the heat sink at low temperature TL1 ,
</p>
<p>the temperature of heat sink is increased to TL2 . Then, the working fluid crosses
</p>
<p>over the regenerator and warms up to Th in an isochoric process 2&ndash;3. In process
</p>
<p>3&ndash;4, the working fluid is expanded in a constant temperature Th process and
</p>
<p>receives heat from the heat source in which its temperature is reduced from TH1 to
</p>
<p>TH2 . Last process (4&ndash;1), is an isochoric cooling process, where the regenerator
</p>
<p>absorbs heat from the working fluid.
</p>
<p>The actual useful heat gain of the dish collector, qu, considering the conduction,
</p>
<p>convection and radiation losses can be obtained as [25]:

<p>15.2.2 Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHPs)
</p>
<p>An air source heat pump is an electrical device that extracts heat from the inside air
</p>
<p>and transfers it to the outside air in hot climate and vice versa in cold weather [26].
</p>
<p>In other words, the air source heat pump&rsquo;s cycle is reversible. Based on the heating
</p>
<p>and the cooling energy exchange sources, the air source heat pumps can be clas-
</p>
<p>sified in two general categories:
</p>
<p>&bull; Air to water heat pump
</p>
<p>The first type is the air to water heat pump. In cold weather, it absorbs heat from
</p>
<p>the outside air and transfers it to the water in the hydronic distribution unit. In
</p>
<p>hot weather conditions, it extracts heat from the water in the hydronic distri-
</p>
<p>bution unit and pumps it to the outside air.
</p>
<p>&bull; Air to air heat pump (AAHP)
</p>
<p>The most common type of the air source heat pumps is the air to air heat
</p>
<p>pump. An AAHP extracts heat from the air and transfers it to the inside or the
</p>
<p>outside air of the building depending on the season. There are two cycles for an
</p>
<p>air source heat pump: The cooling cycle and the heating cycle.
</p>
<p>434 F. Jabari et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.2.2.1 The Cooling Cycle of the Air to Air Heat Pump
</p>
<p>The cooling cycle of the building using the air to air heat pump is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.4. In the cooling process of the building inside space, the heating energy is
</p>
<p>taken from the indoor air and then pumped to the outdoor air. An AAHP contains
</p>
<p>the following component: compressor, evaporator, condenser, and an expansion
</p>
<p>valve. The liquid refrigerant enters the indoor evaporator coils. In the inside
</p>
<p>evaporator, the low pressure liquid refrigerant absorbs heat from the warm inside
</p>
<p>air, vaporizes, and changes into a low temperature or cold vapor. The compressor
</p>
<p>coil then pumps the vapor, increases its pressure, and changes it into a hot high
</p>
<p>pressure vapor. The generated high-temperature high-pressure vapor passes over
</p>
<p>the condenser coil and then heating energy is given off to the outside air, and the
</p>
<p>vapor condenses to change to a high-temperature high-pressure liquid. The gen-
</p>
<p>erated liquid then passes over the expansion valve and changes into the
</p>
<p>low-temperature low-pressure liquid refrigerant. The cooling cycle is then repeated
</p>
<p>again. The energy required to operate the cooling cycle is the electrical energy,
</p>
<p>which powers the compressor inside and outside fans.
</p>
<p>15.2.2.2 The Heating Cycle of the Air to Air Heat Pump
</p>
<p>In the heating process, the heating flow is taken from the outdoor cold air and then
</p>
<p>pumped to the inside cold air. The outside air always contains some heat, a heat
</p>
<p>pump can supply heat to a building even on cold days [26]. The heating process of
</p>
<p>the residential buildings using the AAHPs is shown in Fig. 15.5.
</p>
<p>During the heating process, the liquid refrigerant enters the outdoor evaporator
</p>
<p>coil and absorbs heat from the outdoor air to evaporate, and changes into the low
</p>
<p>temperature liquid and vapor mixture. The vapor then enters the compressor,
</p>
<p>compressed, changes into the high temperature high pressure vapor. The heating

</p>
<p>15 Optimal Planning of a Micro-combined Cooling &hellip; 435</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>energy from the high temperature high pressure vapor is transferred to the inside
</p>
<p>cold air, causing the refrigerant to condense into the high temperature high pressure
</p>
<p>liquid. The hot high pressure liquid passes though the expansion valve and changes
</p>
<p>into the low temperature low pressure liquid refrigerant. Similar to the cooling
</p>
<p>cycle, the electrical energy powers the compressor, the inside and the outside fans.
</p>
<p>15.3 Energy and Exergy Analysis of the Proposed Micro
</p>
<p>Tri-generation System
</p>
<p>15.3.1 Combined Cooling and Power (CCP) Mode for Hot
</p>
<p>Weather Conditions
</p>
<p>The CCP mode of the proposed micro-CCHP system, which can be used for
</p>
<p>residential buildings, is shown in Fig. 15.6. According to Fig. 15.6, the SDSHE is
</p>
<p>used to drive the power generation unit. The output electric power generated by the
</p>
<p>power generating unit can be obtained from (15.20):
</p>
<p>PPGU &frac14; gelecPOSE &eth;15:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>where, PPGU is the output electric power in kW and gelec is the electrical efficiency
</p>
<p>of the power generating unit. The cooling energy generated by an AAHP, Qevap, can
</p>
<p>be calculated from the following equation:
</p>
<p>Qevap &frac14; _m4&eth;h1 � h4&THORN; &eth;15:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>where, Qevap and _m4 are the cooling energy generated by the AAHP in kW, and the
</p>
<p>mass flow rate of the refrigerant through each component such as evaporator, com-
</p>
<p>pressor, condenser and expansion valve in kg � s�1, respectively. Variables h1 and h4

<p>15.4 Simulation Results and Discussion
</p>
<p>In order to achieve the optimal performance of the proposed micro tri-generation
</p>
<p>system, the optimization process is conducted in two typical conditions: hot
</p>
<p>weather (CCP mode), and cold weather (CHP mode). A discontinuous nonlinear
</p>
<p>program (DNLP) is solved using CONOPT solver under general algebraic mod-
</p>
<p>eling system (GAMS) optimization software. The required parameters for the
</p>
<p>simulation of the solar micro-CCHP system are listed at appendix. In this chapter,

<p>the mass flow rate of the refrigerant, and the specific heat capacity of air are
</p>
<p>assumed to be constant due to the negligible changes during a hot or cold day.
</p>
<p>A benchmark residential building is considered in Tabriz, Iran to demonstrate the
</p>
<p>robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed CCHP system. The cooling,
</p>
<p>heating and electrical demands are shown in Fig. 15.8.

</p>
<p>The obtained optimal operating points of the proposed micro-CCHP system
</p>
<p>during the typical summer day are reported in Figs. 15.10, 15.11 and Table 15.1.

<p>and outside fans, electric chiller and building&rsquo;s electric demand increases. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, the hourly electrical energy purchased from the local grid during the
</p>
<p>sample hot day is equal to zero. According to the above results, the AAHP gen-
</p>
<p>erates 29.080 kW of total cooling energy required for the test residential building.
</p>
<p>The electric power consumed by the electric chiller and the cooling demand change
</p>
<p>in a similar manner during the hot day. In the meantime, the minimum and max-
</p>
<p>imum cooling demands are equal to 34 and 70 kW, respectively. Hence, supposing
</p>
<p>_m &frac14; 0:2 kg s�1 in CCP mode, the AAHP provides almost 41.5% of the total cooling
demand during the hottest hour (t &frac14; 16). If the mass flow rate of the refrigerant
increases, the AAHP&rsquo;s thermal capacity and the electric power consumed by the
</p>
<p>electric chiller will increase and decrease, respectively. Based on Figs. 15.9, 15.10
</p>
<p>and 15.11, the electric power consumed by the outside fan, ambient temperature
</p>
<p>and the supplied outside air temperature change in a similar fashion. According to
</p>
<p>Eq. (15.24) and assuming that Tout�airevap &frac14; 292K, if the inside air temperature
</p>
<p>increases, Tout�airevap � Tin�air becomes more negative. Hence, the electric power
</p>
<p>consumed by the inside fan will decrease. The electric power consumed by the
</p>
<p>inside fan maximized and minimized at t = 8 and t = 11, respectively. These two
</p>
<p>points coincide with the maximum and minimum points of the inside air temper-
</p>
<p>ature. As a result, an air to air heat pump can provide efficient cooling energy for a
</p>
<p>large-scale residential building using air as a renewable energy source, especially in
</p>
<p>a warm area. Finally, the cooling distribution systems such as forced air units can
</p>
<p>distribute the generated cooling energy and the cold weather between different flats
</p>
<p>and floors.
</p>
<p>15.4.2 CHP Mode
</p>
<p>The variations of ambient and indoor air temperatures during a sample autumn day
</p>
<p>are plotted in Fig. 15.12.
</p>
<p>The obtained optimum operating points of the proposed tri-generation system in
</p>
<p>CHP mode can be summarized in Table 15.2 and shown in Figs. 15.13 and 15.14.
</p>
<p>According to Figs. 15.8 and 15.14, the mass flow rate of the refrigerant increases
</p>
<p>monotonically as the value of heating demand increases. Hence, the values of _m and
</p>
<p>the maximum and minimum of the heating load occur at t = 4 and t = 15,
</p>
<p>respectively. The energy flux between the refrigerant and the outside air will be
</p>
<p>increased as the values of _m and heating demand increase. Also, if the heating load
</p>
<p>increases, the electric energy consumed by the inside fan, required to supply the
</p>
<p>inside cold weather, will increase. As shown in Fig. 15.14, the sum of the electrical
</p>
<p>energy consumed by the inside and outside fans, compressor and building&rsquo;s electric
</p>
<p>demand can be met by generator output power driven by a SDSHE (Thermal
</p>
<p>storage unit has been used for continuous energy supplying when sunlight is

<p>insufficient or nighttime). Note that the hourly objective cost obtained from opti-
</p>
<p>mizing of CHP mode is zero. From Fig. 15.13, the minimum value of the supplied
</p>
<p>inside air temperature is equal to 393.12 K. Assuming 10% heat losses in warm air
</p>
<p>storage tank (WAST), this value is reduced to 353.8080 K. In central heating
</p>
<p>system, minimum inlet water temperature to radiators is equal to 180 �F or
</p>
<p>355.22 K. Hence, the supplied inside air stored in WAST can satisfy the inlet water
</p>
<p>temperature to radiant floor systems. As an important result, an AAHP can supply

<p>the total heating demand (Qcond) of large residential towers with different flats and

</p>
<p>and expansion valve at no cost and without environmental pollutants and green-

</p>
<p>15.5 Conclusion
</p>
<p>In this chapter, a novel methodology was introduced for short-term scheduling of
</p>
<p>small-scale tri-generation system, which can be used to provide cooling, heating
</p>
<p>and power for residential applications. The solar energy may be used as a renewable
</p>
<p>energy to drive a Stirling engine, which is used to deliver the primary mechanical
</p>
<p>power required for driving a generator. The heat absorber and thermal storage unit
</p>
<p>are employed to absorb and store sun radiations collected by the solar dish. The air
</p>
<p>to air heat pumps were proposed to cool and heat the residential buildings during
</p>
<p>summer and spring/autumn days, respectively. The proposed micro-CCHP system
</p>
<p>does not use any fossil fuel such as gasoline and natural gas. Thus, use of solar
</p>
<p>energy and ASHPs in a CCHP system not only reduces the carbon dioxide,
</p>
<p>greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution, but also reduces the fuel
</p>
<p>consumption. Meanwhile, the proposed CCHP microgrid consumes less electricity
</p>
<p>energy than the traditional tri-generation systems. The contributions of the current
</p>
<p>chapter can be summarized as follows:

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Environmental friendliness: In this chapter, solar energy and air are used as
</p>
<p>renewable energy sources to drive a prime mover and an air to air heat pump,
</p>
<p>which is required in order to provide mechanical and cooling/heating energies
</p>
<p>for a modern residential tower.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost-cutting: The air to air heat pump was proposed to cool and heat the
</p>
<p>residential buildings in CCP and CHP modes. The energy required to operate
</p>
<p>the refrigeration cycle is the electrical energy, which powers the compressor,
</p>
<p>inside and outside fans. Hence, AAHPs based CCHP consumes less electrical
</p>
<p>energy than the traditional fossil fuels-based tri-generation systems.
</p>
<p>&bull; On-site fulfillment: The heating energy obtained from ASHPs is not generated
</p>
<p>by a combustion process, but is transferred from one place to another.
</p>
<p>It is clear that building&rsquo;s insulation reduces heat losses and can decrease the
</p>
<p>heating and the cooling demands. Hence, the electrical energy consumed by AAHP
</p>
<p>and electric chiller will be reduced. In a nutshell, a novel zero energy system was
</p>
<p>proposed to make residential tower technology smarter.

<p>Communication Methods for Smart
</p>
<p>Buildings and Nearly Zero-Energy
</p>
<p>Buildings
</p>
<p>Yasin Kabalci
</p>
<p>Abstract This chapter presents wired and wireless communication systems in
</p>
<p>smart homes and smart buildings by considering the recent developments seen in
</p>
<p>applications. In order to provide further knowledge for readers, the basic principles
</p>
<p>of the smart homes and energy efficient buildings are firstly introduced. Then, the
</p>
<p>nearly zero-energy buildings and renewable energy integration in buildings issues
</p>
<p>are comprehensively explained by taking into account existing applications. In
</p>
<p>addition, advanced metering infrastructure that is a vital component of the smart
</p>
<p>home systems is expressed in detail. Afterwards, the potential candidates of com-
</p>
<p>munication systems for smart buildings that have an important role to realize nearly
</p>
<p>zero-energy buildings are discussed by comparing each method and application
</p>
<p>types thoroughly. These communication systems are classified as wired and wire-
</p>
<p>less communication systems to examine more detailed and the communication
</p>
<p>systems are compared according to several considerable parameters such as used
</p>
<p>spectrum, modulation types, bit rates, supported network topologies, media access
</p>
<p>control (MAC) schemes, carrier types, and application areas. Moreover, several
</p>
<p>applications of examined communication systems are presented both for outdoor
</p>
<p>and indoor scenarios.

<p>more automation in daily life and industry, security of electric services, increased
</p>
<p>life-time of home appliances, and increasing the comfort of consumers. Owing to
</p>
<p>the improvement of smart grids, various developing methods and technologies have
</p>
<p>been reported in past decade by researchers across the globe. The most widely
</p>
<p>known technologies among them are smart meters (SMs), advanced metering
</p>
<p>infrastructure (AMI), home automation, bidirectional communication, and home
</p>
<p>area networks (HANs). The conventional electric power grid has been serving more
</p>
<p>than one century. The increasing and varying consumer profile depending to the
</p>
<p>increased population requires the conventional grid to supply electrical devices
</p>
<p>more than ever that causes instability of the electric power grid. The applications of
</p>
<p>the smart grid include generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption of
</p>
<p>electrical energy. The most important advance provided by the smart grid during the
</p>
<p>generation is to enable the distributed power generation, where power can be
</p>
<p>generated locally; to use the required energy and sale excess power back to utility.

<p>In transmission and distribution applications, the smart grid enables electric pro-
</p>
<p>viders to increase control capabilities by improving the reliability, stability, and
</p>
<p>sustainability of the system. Therefore, it is also demonstrated that economic and
</p>
<p>social benefits can be provided by consuming electrical energy efficiently. The
</p>
<p>smart building energy management systems (SBEMS) increase the efficient con-
</p>
<p>suming, and any consumer can reduce the energy bill and decrease peak demand.
</p>
<p>In recent years, the home environment has been rapidly converted to network
</p>
<p>enabled digital technologies. This improvement enabled the home appliances to
</p>
<p>increase the connectivity within the buildings for the purpose of home automation
</p>
<p>in novel and exciting opportunities. Power line communication (PLC) systems and
</p>
<p>mobile devices increase their communication speeds due to their portability and
</p>
<p>their wide range of capabilities. Hence, this chapter intends to comprehensively
</p>
<p>describe the communication methods for smart buildings that have an important
</p>
<p>role to realize nearly zero-energy buildings. The distributed generation (DG) that is
</p>
<p>one of the basic features of smart grids can be enabled to integrate to the man-
</p>
<p>agement system to allow consumers to manage renewable energy sources such as
</p>
<p>solar panels and wind turbine, electric vehicles and energy storage system com-
</p>
<p>prised of batteries that may be included in the energy infrastructure of the buildings.
</p>
<p>Thus, the SBEMS permits consumers to decrease the energy consumption and bill
</p>
<p>costs owing to the renewable energy sources that are controlled by the SBEMS
</p>
<p>besides security, illumination, heating, and multimedia system controls. The main
</p>
<p>features of the SBEMS are online control capability, renewable energy integration
</p>
<p>and consumption control, the charge amount of energy storage system, listing of
</p>
<p>monthly energy consumption rates saved bill costs, wireless monitoring and
</p>
<p>management system, and user interface to control home appliances. The commu-
</p>
<p>nication methods utilized for the smart buildings and nearly zero-energy buildings
</p>
<p>can be classified into two categories as wired and wireless communication systems.
</p>
<p>The PLC system provides an efficient communication scheme for transmitting and
</p>
<p>receiving any type of data by employing existing power lines. In addition, the PLC
</p>
<p>system presents an inexpensive and suitable communication channel for data
</p>
<p>transmission and is a potential candidate in many application areas such as smart
</p>
<p>homes, vehicles, home automation systems, smart grids and so on. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, the wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi can be utilized in
</p>
<p>the smart buildings alternatively. In this chapter, emerging communication tech-
</p>
<p>nologies, advanced design and modeling studies on nearly zero-energy buildings
</p>
<p>are comprehensively discussed.
</p>
<p>16.2 Smart Homes and Energy Efficient Buildings
</p>
<p>Smart home term can be defined as the integration of technology and services in
</p>
<p>order to present for a better quality of living, where the transmission of information
</p>
<p>is provided by means of home networking. This technology offers several features
</p>
<p>to users such as connecting, controlling and monitoring home appliances and
</p>
<p>462 Y. Kabalci</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>performing the functions with respect to predefined conditions. These features can
</p>
<p>be accomplished with communication systems of the smart homes based on the
</p>
<p>internet, mobile phones and PLC systems. In addition, developments on sensor
</p>
<p>technologies, embedded systems and communication systems have enabled the
</p>
<p>control of the smart homes in an easy and manageable way [1]. A smart home
</p>
<p>concept is shown in Fig. 16.1.
</p>
<p>The smart homes that offer flexibility and functionality advantages require an
</p>
<p>energy management system called the SBEMS to provide economic and social
</p>
<p>benefits to users. In addition to conventional home management systems, the
</p>
<p>SBEMS controls the DG that is one of the basic features of smart grids, renewable
</p>
<p>energy sources and the interaction of electric vehicles with homes. The technical
</p>
<p>background of the SBEMS can be classified into two categories as home man-
</p>
<p>agement system and energy management system. The home management system
</p>
<p>contains the control of electrical appliances used by the user&rsquo;s daily life and is
</p>
<p>concerned with user&rsquo;s comfort and other necessities. For instance, it comprises
</p>
<p>control of illumination, heating, cooling, multimedia systems and electrical
</p>
<p>household appliances. The second part of the SBEMS, which is the energy man-
</p>
<p>agement system, includes details that are more technical. The DG systems of the
</p>
<p>renewable energy sources such as wind turbine and solar panels, support units of
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.1 The concept of smart home systems
</p>
<p>16 Communication Methods for Smart Buildings &hellip; 463</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>these systems such as energy conversion and storage systems and the integration of
</p>
<p>electric vehicles can be utilized more efficiently owing to the energy management
</p>
<p>features of the SBEMS. A control and interface infrastructure diagram of the
</p>
<p>SBEMS is illustrated in Fig. 16.2.
</p>
<p>The main features of SBEMS given in the Fig. 16.2 can be summarized as
</p>
<p>renewable energy integration, energy consumption control, the charge amount of
</p>
<p>energy storage system, online control capability, listing of daily, weekly or monthly
</p>
<p>energy consumption rates to save bill costs, communication capability for moni-
</p>
<p>toring and management system, and user interface to control home appliances.
</p>
<p>Input data of the SBEMS that are shown on the left side of the Fig. 16.2 are
</p>
<p>transferred to the energy management system to inform users about actual status of
</p>
<p>the building. On the other hand, the right side of the figure indicates output controls
</p>
<p>and analyzes that can be carried out by the users. For instance, on/off control system
</p>
<p>contains basic level controls for starting or stopping commonly used electrical
</p>
<p>appliances and devices such as lamps, television, washing machine, refrigerator, air
</p>
<p>conditioning and so on.
</p>
<p>In recent years, the development of internet technology has led to social and
</p>
<p>economic developments. Depending on the rapid spreading of wireless internet,
</p>
<p>people can take advantage of internet technology even if they are outdoors and are
</p>
<p>able to follow their all activities. Furthermore, the interaction between internet and
</p>
<p>daily family life has enabled the creation of the infrastructure for smart home
</p>
<p>technologies. Internet based management systems can be provided remote control
</p>
<p>for electrical household appliances to form intended comforts before the users reach
</p>
<p>home. In addition to this, the conducted investigations shown that hard-working
</p>
<p>people did not take the time to track these systems and they considered the tracking
</p>
<p>process as a waste of time. Therefore, some of the users also expect that the system
</p>
<p>is able to track the situation automatically and able to predict or remember user&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>habits according to the user&rsquo;s requests [2&ndash;5]. Although these demands are noted
</p>
<p>among the features of the home management system, the smart home management
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.2 Control and interface infrastructure of the SBEMS
</p>
<p>464 Y. Kabalci</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>systems used in the Far East and the United States carry out the management of the
</p>
<p>home, by recognizing the user&rsquo;s behavior, according to the user&rsquo;s habits rather than
</p>
<p>simply fulfill the user&rsquo;s commands.
</p>
<p>16.3 Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings and Renewable
</p>
<p>Energy Integration in Buildings
</p>
<p>Energy efficiency has become an important issue since energy consumption has
</p>
<p>been increased throughout the world in recent years. The decreasing fossil fuels
</p>
<p>directed governments to encourage use of the renewable energy sources and to draw
</p>
<p>attention to the energy efficiency. Recently, researchers have made many studies on
</p>
<p>the energy efficiency. Tascikaraoglu et al. [6] has presented a study on the concept
</p>
<p>of smart home and energy efficiency by examining the structure and requirements
</p>
<p>of the smart grids. According to this study, the smart homes that use the production
</p>
<p>and transmission characteristics of smart grids can provide energy savings between
</p>
<p>10 and 30%. It is also emphasized in the study that user habits on this ratio are
</p>
<p>highly effective [6&ndash;8]. In addition, it is important to note that the SMs, energy
</p>
<p>management system and user habits should be considered to obtain energy savings
</p>
<p>in the specified ratio [8]. In [9], Missaoui et al. has reported that intensive resear-
</p>
<p>ches, which are mostly carried out considering the consumption side have been
</p>
<p>done on the smart grid technology and load control issues in the last 2 years. The
</p>
<p>total energy consumed at homes corresponds to 32% of the total amount consumed
</p>
<p>in the world according to results of this study. At the same time, 36% of the carbon
</p>
<p>emissions occurred in the European Union (EU) countries is caused by the homes.
</p>
<p>Within the scope of the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy policy, not only the energy
</p>
<p>performance but also load management in the homes has been identified as an
</p>
<p>important issue and was included in the 2020 plans [9, 10]. Moreover, a building
</p>
<p>energy management system is designed to control an electric kettle, heating,
</p>
<p>cooling, ventilation system and thermodynamic system in [9]. Research results
</p>
<p>shown that home appliances such as the heater, washing machine, dishwasher and
</p>
<p>refrigerator caused by 80% of energy consumption resulting from home. Mahmood
</p>
<p>et al. [11] realized a study based on demand response and consumption side of
</p>
<p>energy management similar to previously mentioned work. For this purpose, they
</p>
<p>focused on linear programming and developed an optimization algorithm to reduce
</p>
<p>the power consumption at homes. They built an infrastructure enabling the use of
</p>
<p>smart devices for smart home energy management and called this system as &ldquo;home
</p>
<p>appliances coordination scheme&rdquo;. Capitanelli et al. [12] also proposed another
</p>
<p>simulation model for smart home management system, where authors utilized this
</p>
<p>simulation model to manage household appliances in terms of performance and
</p>
<p>energy consumption. Accordingly, the proposed method is carried out in six stages.
</p>
<p>In the first two stages, users&rsquo; requirements are determined and these requirements
</p>
<p>are defined as the smart home functions. The third stage covers classification and
</p>
<p>16 Communication Methods for Smart Buildings &hellip; 465</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>identification operations of the household appliance characteristics. In the following
</p>
<p>stage, a general information management model is created. After defining the rules
</p>
<p>and tasks for intelligent system, service functions are performed and are stored in
</p>
<p>the last stage.
</p>
<p>In another study, the most widely used devices in the homes and their usage rates
</p>
<p>are investigated as a special case study for the Canada [13]. According to this work,
</p>
<p>the most widely used home devices are heating systems, refrigerators, electric cars,
</p>
<p>washing machines, dishwashers and lighting systems in terms of electricity con-
</p>
<p>sumption. In addition, the 45.6% of homes do not have the stereo system whereas
</p>
<p>there is at least one at 43.2% of them. The obtained results shown that annual
</p>
<p>energy consumption results are 19.3 MWh for heating devices, 5.5 MWh for water
</p>
<p>heaters, 3.6 MWh for electric cars, 1.364 MWh for washing machines and dryers
</p>
<p>and 1.277 MWh for lighting systems. The communication systems used in home
</p>
<p>management systems are indicated as Wi-Fi, WiMax, 3G, DSL, Ethernet, ZigBee
</p>
<p>and fiber optics. The ZigBee that is one of the mentioned communication methods
</p>
<p>is employed on an energy management system reported by Batista et al. [14].
</p>
<p>Although many communication technologies are appropriate, the ZigBee is pre-
</p>
<p>ferred in this study due to low power consumption in wireless communication
</p>
<p>protocols and suitability to the control and monitoring applications. In studies about
</p>
<p>the SMs conducted from 2009 to 2015, the ZigBee has become rapidly widespread
</p>
<p>and showed an increase of 35%. Therefore, authors establish a ZigBee communi-
</p>
<p>cation platform to monitor renewable energy grid consisting of wind and solar
</p>
<p>energy. In [15], Al-Ali et al. have proposed a GSM based energy management
</p>
<p>system for smart homes integrated with renewable energy sources.
</p>
<p>It is understood from these studies that a large number of the existing homes
</p>
<p>over the world and energy-consuming devices in these buildings increase the
</p>
<p>energy demands excessive. However, decreasing of fossil fuels requires efficient use
</p>
<p>of available energy sources and ensuring energy efficiency as soon as possible. The
</p>
<p>main legislations of the EU are the 2010 Energy Performance of Buildings
</p>
<p>Directive (2010/31/EU) and the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU)
</p>
<p>and these legislations are aimed to reduce energy consumption in the buildings.
</p>
<p>These legislations are also intended to ensure all new buildings to be nearly
</p>
<p>zero-energy buildings by 2020. At this point, the commission defines nearly
</p>
<p>zero-energy buildings as follow: Nearly zero-energy building is a building that is
</p>
<p>capable of a very high-energy performance. The required low amount energy
</p>
<p>should be provided from renewable energy sources which are constructed on-site or
</p>
<p>nearby of these buildings.
</p>
<p>16.4 Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)
</p>
<p>The smart metering systems that are composed of measurement and monitoring
</p>
<p>process are intended to provide information to users about energy consumption of
</p>
<p>the smart homes. The acquired data are mapped with respect to utilized
</p>
<p>466 Y. Kabalci</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>communication protocol standards and are conveyed to management system over
</p>
<p>wired or wireless communication networks. The AMI system could be considered
</p>
<p>as an improved type of the conventional automatic meter reading (AMR) and
</p>
<p>automatic meter management (AMM) systems since it includes various developed
</p>
<p>technologies such as the SMs, HANs, wide area networks (WANs) or neighbored
</p>
<p>networks [16, 17]. The smart measurement process can be carried out by employing
</p>
<p>a SM that computes the energy consumption of any smart home. Hence, the SMs
</p>
<p>should have the ability to determine energy consumption rates of the smart homes
</p>
<p>in real-time by measuring parameters such as voltage, current, phase angle and
</p>
<p>frequency. A smart metering system involved in the metering and communication
</p>
<p>infrastructures is depicted in Fig. 16.3.
</p>
<p>As can be seen from the figure, the metering section of the SM contains
</p>
<p>time-of-use pricing control system, data management system (DMS), and AMR
</p>
<p>framework. Wired or wireless communication techniques can be used in the
</p>
<p>communication part of the smart metering system. The communication substructure
</p>
<p>should permit a two-way data flow between smart homes and users. Therefore,
</p>
<p>network connection and control substructure are also required in the communica-
</p>
<p>tion part of the SM. In addition to these two main sections, the SM modules may
</p>
<p>contain power supply module, timing module, indicating module, and encoding
</p>
<p>module. Besides, the SMs control the energy demand of the user by restricting
</p>
<p>consumption. It is noteworthy that the SMs will cover important roles in the future
</p>
<p>of the smart home applications due to their real time management, scalability, and
</p>
<p>security features. It is important to note at this point that the use of the access point
</p>
<p>architecture is also required to communicate with several hundreds of the SMs in an
</p>
<p>area. Therefore, the security issue should be taken into account for preserving
</p>
<p>measurement information in the SMs.

<p>16.5 Wired Communication Systems for Smart Buildings
</p>
<p>The most significant advantages provided by wired communication systems are
</p>
<p>reliability and insensitivity to interference. While the PLC systems utilize con-
</p>
<p>ventional power lines, fiber optic and digital subscriber line (DSL) systems use
</p>
<p>telephone lines as a communication medium. The capability of transmitting Gbps
</p>
<p>data packets to several kilometers and ability of strength against electromagnetic
</p>
<p>interference are the most important advantages of optical communication systems
</p>
<p>[19, 20]. The optical communication systems can be used over high voltage power
</p>
<p>lines due to these advantages. Moreover, optical power ground wire (OPGW)
</p>
<p>cables that are a special type of optical cables are able to transmit high capacity data
</p>
<p>over long distances. The DSL systems, which permit to transmit digital data by
</p>
<p>telephone lines can be utilized as a wired communication technology in smart
</p>
<p>homes. High-speed data transmission can be accomplished by using digital com-
</p>
<p>munication methods. For instance, while the DSL systems provide up to 10 Gbps
</p>
<p>data rates, coaxial and fiber optic cables reach between 155 Mbps and 160 Gbps
</p>
<p>data rates [19, 21, 22].
</p>
<p>Recently, the PLC systems have gained a great deal of attention in the field of
</p>
<p>communication, smart grid and home automation systems. These systems provide
</p>
<p>an efficient communication scheme for transmitting and receiving any type of data,
</p>
<p>voice, and internet by using existing power lines [23&ndash;29]. When the PLC systems
</p>
<p>are compared with the other communication systems, the most important advantage
</p>
<p>offered by the PLC systems is obvious that there is no need to construct a new
</p>
<p>communication medium because of the fact that they utilize the current power lines
</p>
<p>to convey any type of data. Generally, the PLC applications can be classified into
</p>
<p>two categories as indoor and outdoor in terms of their application types. The most
</p>
<p>remarkable outdoor applications of the PLC systems are the smart grids that intent
</p>
<p>to accomplish several processes of conventional and renewable grids such as
</p>
<p>remote sensing, measurement, monitoring, and control in a maintainable and
</p>
<p>trustworthy way [20, 27, 28]. In addition, attention paid to this system is growing
</p>
<p>owing to numerous reasons such as the DGs, energy planning, remote monitoring
</p>
<p>and demand prediction issues. On the other hand, indoor applications of these
</p>
<p>systems aim to ensure high-data rate communication benefits for homes and offices.
</p>
<p>The PLC systems can utilize different frequency bands called as narrowband
</p>
<p>(NB) and broadband (BB) according to types of applications. In addition, many
</p>
<p>national and international organizations are started to define standards for countries.
</p>
<p>These standards aim to identify substantial criteria such as types of modulation,
</p>
<p>bandwidth, channel and source coding schemes, operating frequency and limits of
</p>
<p>electromagnetic compatibility for indoor and outdoor applications of the PLC
</p>
<p>systems. In general, it can be noted that while the BB PLC systems ensure high data
</p>
<p>rates thanks to wide bandwidth, the NB PLC systems are preferable in low-data rate
</p>
<p>applications such as remote data acquisition, AMR systems, remote fault local-
</p>
<p>ization and fault type recognition. The NB PLC standard utilized in Europe exploits
</p>
<p>between 3 and 148.5 kHz frequency band with respect to European CENELEC
</p>
<p>468 Y. Kabalci</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Standard EN50065. Furthermore, the NB PLC standards of the U.S. and Japan are
</p>
<p>9&ndash;490 kHz in accordance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and
</p>
<p>10&ndash;450 kHz with respect to Association of Radio Industries and Businesses
</p>
<p>(ARIB), respectively [30]. On the other hand, while the operating frequency of the
</p>
<p>BB PLC is proposed between 2 and 50 MHz according to the IEEE 1901-2010
</p>
<p>standard, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommends between
</p>
<p>2 and 100 MHz frequency band. The standards, technical specifications and
</p>
<p>application areas for the BB and NB PLC systems are given in Tables 16.1 and
</p>
<p>16.2, respectively.
</p>
<p>16.5.1 Outdoor Application Examples for the PLC Systems
</p>
<p>Several SG examples for outdoor application of the PLC systems are given in this
</p>
<p>subsection. First example deals with the feasibility of the PLC systems in renewable
</p>
<p>energy generation system modeled in Matlab/Simulink [32]. The aim of this system
</p>
<p>is to demonstrate that the electrical power lines are not only utilized to carry line
</p>
<p>voltages but also to transmit several measurement data of the renewable energy
</p>
<p>grids. Thus, monitoring costs can be reduced by using the reported technique rather
</p>
<p>than the SCADA, Ethernet or GSM based systems. The main parts of the designed
</p>
<p>system in the Matlab/Simulink are the photovoltaic (PV) panels, boost converter
</p>
<p>with perturb and observe (P&amp;O) control algorithm, full bridge inverter, coupling
</p>
<p>circuits and the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modem that is exploited to
</p>
<p>transmit measured data over the power lines. The block diagram of the system is
</p>
<p>depicted in Fig. 16.4.
</p>
<p>As can be seen from the block diagram, the BPSK modulator structure is con-
</p>
<p>nected to the output of the full bridge inverter to employ power lines as a com-
</p>
<p>munication channel. The modulator aims to convey output power information of the
</p>
<p>PV panels over the 10 km transmission line which is also modeled in
</p>
<p>Matlab/Simulink depend on the PI section line model. A coupling device usage is
</p>
<p>also required in order to combine the BPSK modems with transmission lines.
</p>
<p>The BPSK demodulator structure is established at the end of the transmission line to
</p>
<p>acquire the output power information of the PV panels at the monitoring center.
</p>
<p>Figure 16.5 shows obtained results for modeled remote monitoring system
</p>
<p>where two different scenarios are considered in terms of filtering circuit utilized in
</p>
<p>the BPSK demodulator structure. The cut-off values of the filter are set to 250 Hz
</p>
<p>and 4 kHz in the performed simulations. The fine filtering term is used for the
</p>
<p>250 Hz filter that provides better performance as can be shown from the Fig. 16.5b.
</p>
<p>While the first curves given in Fig. 16.5 show the measured output data of the PV
</p>
<p>panels, the second curves depict the quantized data signals of the BPSK modulator.
</p>
<p>The demodulated data acquired from the output of the BPSK demodulator are given
</p>
<p>in the third curves and the filtered and calibrated data are shown in the fourth and

<p>fifth curves, respectively. When the reported results in the Fig. 16.5a, b are com-
</p>
<p>pared, it is clearly shown that the filtering process has an important effect on the
</p>
<p>performance of the system. It is important to note that even though the modulated
</p>
<p>data of the output power information are embedded into the grid, there is no
</p>
<p>distortional effect in the power line and the total harmonic distortion (THD) values
</p>
<p>of the system are in the suitable ranges according to IEEE-519-1992 and IEC-61000
</p>
<p>standards.
</p>
<p>An improved PLC system model is presented as the second application where
</p>
<p>the Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK Quadrature) modems are designed to
</p>
<p>create the PLC infrastructure. The modeled energy monitoring system in
</p>
<p>Matlab/Simulink is shown in Fig. 16.6. First part of the model is the solar plant
</p>
<p>which is constituted by regarding 170 W commercial solar panels.
</p>
<p>In addition, the solar plant contains parallel-connected PV panels with the
</p>
<p>capability of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. While the con-
</p>
<p>verter output of the modeled system is fed to a three-phase IGBT inverter, generated
</p>
<p>AC output voltages are delivered to the grid over 10 km transmission line that are
</p>
<p>created in accordance with practical parameters. The QPSK modems which are
</p>
<p>located at the plant side and grid side are utilized to monitor generated power by the
</p>
<p>solar plant. In addition, coupling devices are employed to prevent information
</p>
<p>losses due to any mismatch.
</p>
<p>Different measurement results of the energy monitoring system are depicted in
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.7a, b. While cutoff frequency of used low pass filter in the QPSK modem is
</p>
<p>adjusted as 500 Hz in the Fig. 16.7a, the cutoff frequency is set to 250 Hz in
</p>
<p>another condition given in the Fig. 16.7b. As can be seen from the measurement
</p>
<p>results, the 250 Hz filtering provides better performance according to the 500 Hz
</p>
<p>filtering. As a final remark, the introduced results shown that use of the QPSK
</p>
<p>modems in the PLC applications to monitor energy plants can provide more
</p>
<p>accurate results according to use of the BPSK modem.

<p>16.5.2 Indoor Applications for the PLC Systems
</p>
<p>In this subsection, different applications of the PLC systems for indoor environ-
</p>
<p>ments are presented. The PLC system can be utilized to transmit data, which may be
</p>
<p>acquired information from any sensor located in the smart buildings, over indoor
</p>
<p>PLC channels. On the other hand, since the power lines have been fundamentally
</p>
<p>designed to deliver electricity over the world, they exhibit a destructive channel
</p>
<p>effect for communication signals. Hence, transmitting high frequency communi-
</p>
<p>cation signals over actual power lines is a difficult problem and the PLC channel
</p>
<p>need to be accurately characterized to solve this problem. A BB indoor PLC
</p>
<p>channel model was reported by taking into account of a realistic network infras-
</p>
<p>tructure for homes and small offices in [33].
</p>
<p>In this PLC channel model, structural features of building electricity network are
</p>
<p>considered to characterize the indoor PLC channel in terms of network scheme,
</p>
<p>employed cable types, and loads connected to the grid. Furthermore, this model
</p>
<p>offers more appropriate channel conditions in point of the attenuation, delay spread
</p>
<p>and average channel gain. Thus, this PLC channel model is exploited to create
</p>
<p>indoor PLC channel conditions in the application examples presented in this
</p>
<p>subsection.

<p>In order to evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performances of different channel
</p>
<p>coding schemes, several computer simulations over the BB PLC channels are
</p>
<p>performed in [34]. Since low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and convolutional
</p>
<p>codes (CC) are widely exploited channel coding codes in the communication
</p>
<p>systems, their performance comparison is presented when they are utilized as
</p>
<p>channel coding schemes in the indoor PLC channels. Two different-rate LDPC
</p>
<p>codes are tested to determine effect of the code rate on the performance of the
</p>
<p>communication systems. In addition, different soft and hard decision LDPC decoder
</p>
<p>schemes such as belief propagation (BP), implementation-efficient reliability ratio
</p>
<p>based weighted bit flipping (IRRWBF), improved weighted bit flipping (IWBF) and
</p>
<p>weighted bit flipping (WBF) decoders are considered in realized simulations.
</p>
<p>Simulation parameters of the designed communication system are given in
</p>
<p>Table 16.3.
</p>
<p>The performance results of the LDPC and CC coded communication systems in
</p>
<p>terms of BER versus Eb/N0 value are shown in Fig. 16.8. While (273,191) LDPC
</p>
<p>codes are selected in the Fig. 16.8a, (495,433) LDPC codes are used in the
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.8b. As expected from the disruptive effects of the indoor PLC channels,
</p>
<p>communication systems cannot supply an acceptable performance up to 15 dB
</p>
<p>Eb/N0 value for both results. When this Eb/N0 point is exceeded, performances of
</p>
<p>the LDPC decoders are increased rapidly. As can be seen from the Fig. 16.8a, b, the
</p>
<p>best performance result is provided by the BP decoder scheme for both results. The
</p>
<p>supplied coding gains by this decoder scheme are as much as 18 dB for a BER of
</p>
<p>10&minus;2 and 17 dB for a BER of 10&minus;1 as seen in Fig. 16.8a and b, respectively.
</p>
<p>Though the worst BER performance among the other LDPC decoders is presented
</p>
<p>by the IWBF decoder scheme, it provides up to 9 dB better performance than that
</p>
<p>of the CC at a BER level of 10&minus;2. The simulation results shown in the Fig. 16.8a, b
</p>
<p>clearly indicate that the BP decoder scheme presents best performance results
</p>
<p>because of using log likelihood ratio (LLR) for decision procedure. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, decoding complexity of the BP decoders is too high. However, WBF and
</p>
<p>IWBF decoders, which are hard decision decodes as mentioned before, offer

<p>tradeoff advantage between error correction and decoding complexity. In addition
</p>
<p>to reduce decoding complexity, IRRWBF decoders ensure very valuable perfor-
</p>
<p>mance on the error correction.
</p>
<p>The BER performances of LDPC coded orthogonal frequency-division multi-
</p>
<p>plexing (OFDM) systems are investigated in another indoor PLC application. This
</p>
<p>example aims to examine effects of the LDPC decoder schemes on the system
</p>
<p>performance which is evaluated over the BB PLC channels provided by Canete
</p>
<p>[33]. The block diagram of the LDPC coded OFDM system with different soft and
</p>
<p>hard decision decoder schemes is illustrated in Fig. 16.9.
</p>
<p>The upper part of the block diagram shows transmitter of the LDPC coded
</p>
<p>OFDM system. Even though input message of the communication system is gen-
</p>
<p>erated by random data generator block, the input message can be also supplied from
</p>
<p>any sensor located in homes or buildings. Later, input message is fed to forward
</p>
<p>error-correction (FEC) block where the LDPC encoder block fulfills channel-coding
</p>
<p>process. The constellation mapper block applies the mapping process, in other
</p>
<p>words modulation process, to the LDPC coded input data. In OFDM transmitter
</p>
<p>block, several important processes such as pilot symbol insertion, cyclic prefix (CP)
</p>
<p>adding and parallel to serial conversion are conducted and then coded data are sent
</p>
<p>to the indoor PLC channels. Several disruptive effects such as noise and attenuation
</p>
<p>that are originated by the characteristics of the power lines impress the data sent to
</p>
<p>the indoor PLC channels. The noise shown in these channels is composed of the
</p>
<p>background noise, impulsive noise and narrowband interferences. The underside of

<p>the block diagram denotes the receiver part of the communication system. In the
</p>
<p>first block of the receiver part, the input serial data are firstly transformed to parallel
</p>
<p>data type and then the CPs of the data are cancelled in order to perform fast Fourier
</p>
<p>transform (FFT) process. After the FFT process, pilot symbol removal and
</p>
<p>demodulation process are respectively applied to the data. The last step of the
</p>
<p>receiver unit is decoding process, which can be implemented by employing soft or
</p>
<p>hard decision decoders.
</p>
<p>In simulation carried out by using Matlab software, the LDPC codes with
</p>
<p>(96,48) and (1080,540) code lengths are exploited to obtain the BER performances
</p>
<p>of the modeled communication system. While the BP, WBF and IRRWBF decoders
</p>
<p>are utilized in the simulation, the maximum iteration number is adjusted as 50 for
</p>
<p>entire decoder schemes. In addition, the subcarrier space and CP of the modeled
</p>
<p>OFDM system are established as 468.75 kHz and 0.53 ls, respectively. The BER
</p>
<p>performance results of coded and uncoded OFDM systems in indoor PLC channels
</p>
<p>are illustrated in Fig. 16.10.
</p>
<p>It is clearly seen from the figure that the LDPC coded OFDM systems outper-
</p>
<p>form with regard to the BER performance than that of the uncoded OFDM system.
</p>
<p>The BER of (96,48) LDPC coded OFDM system shows virtually 9.5 dB better
</p>
<p>performance according to the uncoded system at a BER level of 10&minus;3. Furthermore,
</p>
<p>the (1080,540) LDPC coded system demonstrates 0.7 dB better performance results
</p>
<p>with respect to (96,48) LDPC coded system with BP decoder. When the perfor-
</p>
<p>mances of the WBF and IRRWBF decoders are considered, it is obvious that the
</p>
<p>IRRWBF decoder scheme ever provides approximately 0.5 dB better perfor-
</p>
<p>mances. In addition, it is detected that the hard decision decoder schemes present as
</p>
<p>well as 7.5 dB performance improvement at a BER level of 10&minus;3 with respect to the
</p>
<p>uncoded OFDM communication system.

<p>16.6 Wireless Communication Systems for Smart
</p>
<p>Buildings
</p>
<p>The wireless communication systems are one of the most powerful candidates in
</p>
<p>smart homes. Despite offering several advantages in terms of installation and
</p>
<p>coverage, the main problems of the wireless systems are reflection, diffraction,
</p>
<p>scattering and multipath propagation. Since the local area network (LAN), body
</p>
<p>area network (BAN) and personal area network (PAN) are generally utilized to
</p>
<p>create small area networks, they can be also employed to define HAN in the smart
</p>
<p>homes and nearly zero-energy buildings. Low-cost local network applications are
</p>
<p>generally exploited these network schemes. The HAN, which is formed to realize
</p>
<p>energy management and demand planning has a small coverage area with low
</p>
<p>latency advantage. In addition, the wireless networks contain hierarchical mesh
</p>
<p>networks thanks to wireless LANs to interact with electrical home appliances. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, wireless sensor networks (WSN) can be also used as an alternative
</p>
<p>cost effective solution in the smart homes owing to their low energy requirements.
</p>
<p>The wireless PAN (WPAN or IEEE 802.15.4 standard) intends to define the
</p>
<p>PHY layer for low data rate, low power consumption, and low-cost network. The
</p>
<p>basic PHY layer of the WPAN ensures 256 kbps data rate in the coverage area,
</p>
<p>which covers between 10 and 1600 m in the star topology for single-hop,
</p>
<p>cluster-tree, and mesh topology for multi-hops. In order to control the entire net-
</p>
<p>work, a PAN coordinator is placed in each type of the topology. Moreover, mesh
</p>
<p>and tree topologies are required additional router nodes to establish multi-hop
</p>
<p>connections between coordinator and devices. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is uti-
</p>
<p>lized in various industrial standards to accomplish monitoring and control appli-
</p>
<p>cations. The ISA 100.11a, Wireless-HART, and the ZigBee are the most popular
</p>
<p>standards in this classification. The ZigBee is the most distinguished one rather than
</p>
<p>the other standards since it is widely approved in both industrial and commercial
</p>
<p>applications due to its capabilities on the network management. ZigBee systems
</p>
<p>employ digital radios with low power consumption depending on the IEEE
</p>
<p>802.15.4 standard. The IEEE 802.11 standards utilize 2.4 or 5.8 GHz frequency
</p>
<p>band to standard the PHY and MAC layers of wide LANs (WLAN). The WLANs
</p>
<p>promote two different modes called ad hoc and infrastructure. The ad hoc permits
</p>
<p>stations to form a wireless LAN automatically where entire stations can commu-
</p>
<p>nicate in peer-to-peer architectures with each other. In the second operation mode,
</p>
<p>the network contains at least one access point (AP) in its structure and each terminal
</p>
<p>is accessed through one or more than one access point to another.
</p>
<p>There are various protocols such as Insteon, Z-Wave, SimpliciTI, EnOcean,
</p>
<p>Wavenis and Wireless M-BUS in applications apart from the above-mentioned
</p>
<p>standards [36]. The Insteon is an automation technology, which can be control
</p>
<p>electrical home appliances by using the PLC or wireless communication techniques.
</p>
<p>This protocol uses a dual mesh network topology at the 915 MHz frequency band
</p>
<p>[37]. The Z-Wave system has widely employed to control home appliances thanks
</p>
<p>to mesh network topology [38]. A protocol called SimpliciTI is developed by Texas

<p>Instruments to provide simple and low-power RF network protocol. This protocol
</p>
<p>supports star and peer-to-peer network topology [39]. The EnOcean standard is
</p>
<p>firstly utilized automation systems in buildings, and then it is used in different areas
</p>
<p>such as industry, logistics and smart homes. The peer-to-peer, mesh and star net-
</p>
<p>work topologies can be established in this standard [40]. The Wavenis technology is
</p>
<p>introduced by Coronis systems as a wireless protocol to control and monitor several
</p>
<p>applications of home and building automation. The Wavenis technology supports
</p>
<p>the peer-to-peer, mesh and star network topologies. Although data rates of the
</p>
<p>Wavenis can be programmable up to 100 kbps, most applications exploits at 19.2
</p>
<p>kbps [36]. The Wireless M-Bus (WM-Bus) standard has recently proposed for
</p>
<p>metering applications such as the SMs. The energy requirement of the WM-Bus is
</p>
<p>very low owing to used protocol and frequency bands. In addition, the WM-Bus
</p>
<p>can allow transmission over longer distances than that of the IEEE 802.15.4
</p>
<p>standard [41]. Technical specifications and application areas of the wireless network
</p>
<p>protocols utilized in the smart homes are listed in Tables 16.4 and 16.5. All of these
</p>
<p>network protocols support power saving feature.
</p>
<p>16.7 Conclusions
</p>
<p>Smart home systems aim to integrate technology and services to provide a better
</p>
<p>living quality. These systems can provide several benefits to users such as con-
</p>
<p>necting, controlling and monitoring home appliances. In addition, they can realize
</p>
<p>various functions according to predefined circumstances. The entire of these features
</p>
<p>can be achieved by the communication systems that are one of the most important
</p>
<p>components of the smart homes, smart buildings and nearly zero-energy buildings.
</p>
<p>Hence, the wired and wireless communication systems of the smart buildings and
</p>
<p>nearly zero-energy buildings are introduced in this chapter. When the wired com-
</p>
<p>munication systems are considered, the wired communication systems provide two
</p>
<p>crucial advantages such as reliability and insensitivity to interference. Recently, the
</p>
<p>PLC systems which are based on the idea of conveying any type of data by
</p>
<p>exploiting the power lines originally designed for electrical energy delivery have
</p>
<p>gained a great deal of attention in the field of communication, smart grid and home
</p>
<p>automation systems. The most important advantage provided by the PLC systems
</p>
<p>against the optic fiber and the DSL systems is clearly that they do not require a new
</p>
<p>communication medium owing to being power lines in living areas. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>strongest candidate among the wired communication systems in the smart homes is
</p>
<p>the PLC systems. On the other hand, the wireless technologies can be also consid-
</p>
<p>ered to build wireless HAN in the smart homes. Hence, several wireless technologies
</p>
<p>that are IEEE or not IEEE based standards are discussed for the smart homes.
</p>
<p>The IEEE standards such as ISA 100.11a, Wireless-HART, ZigBee and the Wi-Fi
</p>
<p>are the most popular standards in this classification. The ZigBee technology is the
</p>
<p>most distinguished one rather than the other standards since it is widely approved in
</p>
<p>both industrial and commercial applications due to its capabilities on the network

<p>management. Although the low-power and low data protocols provided by the
</p>
<p>MiWi, ZigBee or Wavenis are sufficient for energy management purposes in smart
</p>
<p>homes, the EnOcean and Insteon cannot ensure a satisfactory security feature. As a
</p>
<p>final remark, it is important to note that the wired and wireless communication
</p>
<p>technologies may be cooperated to establish an efficient, reliable and stable com-
</p>
<p>munication environment in the smart homes and smart buildings.

<p>17.1 Introduction in Very Small Satellites
</p>
<p>The spaceflight literature defines today the artificial satellite (usually, simply called
</p>
<p>satellite) as an object placed on purpose into a space orbit to fulfill a specific
</p>
<p>mission [1]. Small satellites, also known as miniaturized satellites, are defined as
</p>
<p>low mass satellites (up to 500 kg) and small size [2]. The definition of very small
</p>
<p>satellites varies today, sometimes gathering together micro-, nano-, pico- and
</p>
<p>femto-satellites [3], sometimes defining only nanosatellites and picosatellites (such
</p>
<p>as CubeSats) [4], sometimes including all small satellites having under a kilogram
</p>
<p>mass [5] etc.
</p>
<p>Many reasons justified small and very small satellites to appear and develop:
</p>
<p>&bull; big amount of energy saving
</p>
<p>&bull; to lower the cost of the existing heavier satellites, that impose massive rockets to
</p>
<p>make possible the launch operation in space and possibility of multiple launch;
</p>
<p>&bull; to allow with few finance in formation flight of a small satellites cluster;
</p>
<p>&bull; to allow low cost design;
</p>
<p>&bull; to make easier the mass production;
</p>
<p>&bull; to facilitate not solvable missions by larger satellites, such as:
</p>
<p>&ndash; formations missions dedicated to low data rate communications;
</p>
<p>&ndash; data collection missions from multiple points that need formation flights;
</p>
<p>&ndash; in-space inspection and service for larger satellites placed in orbit;
</p>
<p>&ndash; research and design missions for universities.
</p>
<p>Today the very small satellites become a usual presence in space. A significant
</p>
<p>increase of the number of space experiments is also observed. As a direct conse-
</p>
<p>quence of these, are the increased demands and technical challenges for the power
</p>
<p>system. The miniaturized satellites standards like the &ldquo;nanosat&rdquo; or &ldquo;picosat&rdquo; push
</p>
<p>the limits even harder: the engineers face the problem of designing in a restricted
</p>
<p>space, with a limited amount of the available energy and financial resources while
</p>
<p>satisfying in the same time the criteria of maximum capabilities and performances.
</p>
<p>17.1.1 Characteristics of Small Satellites
</p>
<p>The block diagram in Fig. 17.1 points out the mandatory systems present in any
</p>
<p>satellite in order to accomplish the proposed mission (marked with solid lines) and
</p>
<p>its essential supporting systems (marked with intermittent lines).
</p>
<p>In terms of spacecrafts, these systems are usually known and clustered as: the
</p>
<p>payload and the bus. The payload refers to the main communications equipment/
</p>
<p>science instruments for the commercial/research satellites. The bus gathers all the
</p>
<p>other essential systems that assist the payload such as: the electrical power system,
</p>
<p>the communications and data coordinating systems, all on-board telemetry sensors,
</p>
<p>the main satellite&rsquo;s computer etc.
</p>
<p>17 Power Architectures and Power Conditioning Unit &hellip; 493</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The electrical power system contains: the solar array as satellite&rsquo;s primary
</p>
<p>electric source of energy, the batteries to store and regulate this energy and all their
</p>
<p>associated power electronics to convert, control and distribute the electric energy to
</p>
<p>the payload [6]. A part of the electrical power system for very small satellites,
</p>
<p>namely the power conditioning unit, represents the subject of this chapter. Usually,
</p>
<p>the most popular theoretical approach to sort small satellites is by their mass, as
</p>
<p>shown in Table 17.1, where the presented values are just for reference and were
</p>
<p>taken according to the year 2014. In space field, a satellite may have different
</p>
<p>characteristics and still be in one of the presented categories.
</p>
<p>Aside from size and/or mass and the other typical classification criteria presented
</p>
<p>in Table 17.1, there are also some rather important factors such as orbital uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty, low satellite equivalent isotropic radiated power (e.i.r.p.) and speed of
</p>
<p>development [7].
</p>
<p>17.1.2 The Earth Orbits
</p>
<p>The Earth is almost a sphere with the mean radius of 6371.0 km, equatorial radius
</p>
<p>of 6378.1 km and the polar radius of 6356.8 km, that has a reduced flattening (as a
</p>
<p>measure of compression from sphere to spheroid) only of 0.0033528. Starting from
</p>
<p>the surface and up to 160 km in the air, Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is present and then it
</p>
<p>gradually vanishes into the vast space [6].

<p>The Earth orbits of the artificial satellites are mentioned in Table 17.2 with their
</p>
<p>major characteristics. The standard abbreviations of these orbits are:
</p>
<p>&bull; GEO Stationary (abbreviated GEO): the Earth Orbit with an orbital period the
</p>
<p>same as the Earth&rsquo;s rotation period, placed above the Earth&rsquo;s equator
</p>
<p>&bull; GEO Synchronous (abbreviated GSO): the Earth orbit which enables to be
</p>
<p>synchronized with the rotation of the Earth
</p>
<p>&bull; MEO: mid Earth orbit, circular at 2000&ndash;20,000-km altitude
</p>
<p>&bull; LEO: low Earth orbit, generally circular at 200&ndash;2000-km altitude
</p>
<p>&bull; HEO: highly elliptical orbit, such as Molniya.
</p>
<p>Van Allen radiation belts, depicted in Fig. 17.2, represent layers of energetic
</p>
<p>charged particles coming from the solar wind and cosmic rays, which are held in
</p>
<p>place by Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field [8]. The inner belt is formed by o combination of
</p>
<p>many protons and less electrons and the outer belt only of electrons, both being
</p>
<p>very dangerous for satellites. In order to avoid Van Allen belts, the orbit parameters
</p>
<p>of LEO and MEO satellites are chosen to surround the Earth at altitudes of 1.3&ndash;1.7
</p>
<p>and 3.1&ndash;4.1 Earth radii. So, a typical LEO satellite has an altitude of 500&ndash;1500 km,
</p>
<p>an orbit period of 1.5&ndash;2 h, and is visible to a given Earth station for only a few

</p>
<p>12,000 km altitude with orbit period of several hours.
</p>
<p>Today, most of the very small satellites operate in low Earth orbits (LEO), but
</p>
<p>there are no restricted orbits because of two reasons:
</p>
<p>&bull; mainly, their missions are usually technological demonstrations/verifications/
</p>
<p>tests/maneuvers etc. and they last as long as the communication with the Earth is
</p>
<p>maintained;
</p>
<p>&bull; their orbital parameters are defined at the end of the design process because of
</p>
<p>the multitude of launch possibilities, altitude and inclination flexibilities as
</p>
<p>secondary payloads.

<p>17.1.3 Eclipses on Earth Orbits
</p>
<p>When a satellite is on an Earth orbit (Fig. 17.3)&mdash;mostly during the equinox days
</p>
<p>when the longest eclipse appears and consists in the Earth totally blocking the solar
</p>
<p>light to illuminate the satellite&mdash;, the solar array ceases to generate the primary
</p>
<p>electrical power for the satellite and its temperature quickly falls. Therefore, for a

<p>circular Earth orbit of a satellite, the eclipse duration in hours is calculated using the

q
</p>
<p>cos b
; &eth;17:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>where b is the angle of the sunlight incidence on the orbit plane that varies sea-
</p>
<p>sonally between &plusmn;(i + c), i is the orbit inclination with respect to the equator and c
</p>
<p>is the angle between the sun line and the ecliptic plane (23.45&deg;).
</p>
<p>Equation (17.1) above shows how the eclipse duration Te depends on b angle:
</p>
<p>when b grows, Te is diminished, which improves the load capability of the electrical
</p>
<p>power system. There is a specific high value of b angle when no eclipse occurs:
</p>
<p>there are polar and near-polar low Earth orbits (LEO) that never have an eclipse of
</p>
<p>the sun and Te = 0. The opposite situation is when b = 0 and creates the case of the
</p>
<p>longest eclipse: in near-equatorial, circular, low Earth orbits (LEO), eclipses of
</p>
<p>approximately equal duration occur once every orbit period. As a consequence, the
</p>
<p>power system engineer starts with the orbit parameters indicated by the customer in
</p>
<p>order to obtain the orbit period, calculates the eclipse duration Te (that determines
</p>
<p>battery requirements onboard the satellite on a certain day) according to b angle.
</p>
<p>In addition, other parameters may appear if a Moon eclipse occurs simultane-
</p>
<p>ously with the Earth eclipse, when the battery must support an additional depth of
</p>
<p>discharge while temperature falls. Also, the solar flux depends of equinox and
</p>
<p>solstice and varies the power in the solar arrays with 11%. Figure 17.4 shows how
</p>
<p>the eclipse duration Te varies with the orbit altitude, inclination, and the sunlight
</p>
<p>incidence angle on the orbit plane-in LEO, it can vary by one of two factors. All
</p>
<p>these parameters greatly affect the power system design.
</p>
<p>17.1.4 Example of Very Small Satellites: CubeSats
</p>
<p>A typical example of very small satellites is strongly represented today by CubeSats
</p>
<p>[9], that has been widely adopted both by universities and industry as well [10, 11]
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.4 Eclipse in near-equatorial LEO, once per orbit in all seasons

<p>498 S. Oprea et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>due to many reasons distinctive from big satellites: a cheaper and faster design and
</p>
<p>launch, a larger modularization capacity by packaging many devices and sensors,
</p>
<p>project management&rsquo;s cost reduction, availability of the satellite&rsquo;s subsystems as
</p>
<p>Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components, the control from Earth through
</p>
<p>amateur stations, simple architecture and aims etc. CubeSats are in many situations
</p>
<p>called nanosatellites, but they represent only a class of them.
</p>
<p>The elementary cube unit of 10 cm (10 � 10 � 10 cm) and the mass smaller
than 1.33 kg is known as 1U CubeSat, though even 0.5U modules are manufac-
</p>
<p>tured nowadays. Still, only starting from 3U CubeSat dimensions (10 � 10 � 30
cm) with a mass of 3&ndash;4 kg, small payloads can be carried in space, without
</p>
<p>mentioning the additional mandatory equipment that expands these dimensions.
</p>
<p>CubeSats&rsquo; missions are generally classified in: experimental and research mis-
</p>
<p>sions, educational and radio amateur missions and commercial missions. As an
</p>
<p>example of the first mentioned mission, the European Space Agency (ESA) started
</p>
<p>in 2013 and will launch in 2016 (a development of 3 years) a number of four 3U
</p>
<p>CubeSats projects (GomX-3, SIMBA, QARMAN and Picasso) that are part of the
</p>
<p>QB50 flight of the In-Orbit Demonstration (IOD), which is part of the General
</p>
<p>Support Technology Programme (GSTP). Other ESA nanosatellite missions that
</p>
<p>begun in year 2014: cooperative nanosatellites (four parallel &lsquo;Sysnova&rsquo; studies
</p>
<p>within the General Studies Programme), commercial telecom services nanosatellites
</p>
<p>(within ARTES 1 programme) etc. [9].
</p>
<p>Still, there are a number of world organizations from academic and industry who
</p>
<p>design, manufacture and send in space nanosatellites whose buses comply with the
</p>
<p>requirements of a specific mission. In this case, CubeSat design specifications may
</p>
<p>be not followed.

<p>17.2 The Electrical Power System
</p>
<p>The electrical power system (Fig. 17.5) generates, stores, conditions, controls, and
</p>
<p>distributes power within the specified voltage band to all bus and payload
</p>
<p>equipment.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This system includes also the protection circuitry for all credible faults. For
</p>
<p>satellites that orbit Earth the primary energy source is the sun. For deep space
</p>
<p>missions, the primary energy may be supplied by other sources like the radioactive
</p>
<p>generators. The electrical energy provided by the energy conversion unit is further
</p>
<p>processed by the power conditioning unit. Power conditioning unit includes the
</p>
<p>maximum power point tracker, bus voltage regulator, battery charge and discharge
</p>
<p>regulators and additional DC&ndash;DC converters. Some energy may be stored into
</p>
<p>batteries in order to be delivered to the system during eclipses or high power
</p>
<p>demand periods. The distribution and protection unit includes the load switches,
</p>
<p>fuses, additional protection circuitry and the distribution harness. The harness
</p>
<p>consists of conducting wires and connectors that connect various components
</p>
<p>together.
</p>
<p>17.2.1 The Array of Solar Cells
</p>
<p>With few minor exceptions (low-cost, limited life missions that use non-
</p>
<p>rechargeable batteries as primary source) all satellites that orbit Earth use the
</p>
<p>solar energy. The solar energy is converted into electrical energy by meaning of the
</p>
<p>solar cells. The technology of solar arrays evolves continuously during years and
</p>
<p>the conversion efficiency increase significantly. Table 17.3 presents the typical
</p>
<p>solar cells and their characteristics ilicon solar cells have been used for electrical
</p>
<p>power on almost all space satellites since 1958. Their scalability, reliability, and
</p>
<p>predictability have made solar cell/arrays the prime choice for spacecraft designers.
</p>
<p>Early silicon solar cells were typically *11% efficient, and the conversion effi-
</p>
<p>ciency of silicon cells currently flown varies between 12.7 and 14.8%.

<p>Advanced solar cells with improved efficiency developed over the past fifteen
</p>
<p>years include: (1) single junction GaAs solar cells, (2) dual junction III-V com-
</p>
<p>pound semiconductor solar cells utilizing atoms from the 3rd and 5th columns of
</p>
<p>the periodic table, and (3) triple-junction III-V compound semiconductor solar cells.
</p>
<p>GaAs/Ge cells currently available on the market have an average conversion effi-
</p>
<p>ciency of 19% at AMO. The GaAs-type solar cells have higher radiation resistance
</p>
<p>than silicon solar cells. Dual-junction and triple-junction solar cells are presently
</p>
<p>available from several vendors. Commercially available dual-junction solar cells are
</p>
<p>21&ndash;22% efficient.
</p>
<p>Currently, triple-junction cells consisting of GalnP, GaAs, and Ge layers, are
</p>
<p>grown in series connected layers, and are 27% efficient in production lots [12&ndash;14].
</p>
<p>A typical triple junction solar cell is depicted in Fig. 17.6.
</p>
<p>17.2.2 Batteries for Space Applications
</p>
<p>The energy storage is required to meet the spacecraft load demand not only during
</p>
<p>eclipse, but also when the demand exceeds the power generation at any time. The
</p>
<p>most widely used energy storage technology is the battery, which stores energy in
</p>
<p>an electrochemical form. There are two basic types: primary batteries (for very short
</p>
<p>duration missions) and secondary (rechargeable) batteries.
</p>
<p>Major batteries used in the spacecraft industry at present are nickel cadmium
</p>
<p>(NiCd), nickel hydrogen (NiH2), and lithium-ion (Li-ion):
</p>
<p>&bull; NiCd batteries were the first type used in space applications. They have a
</p>
<p>medium energy density of about 30 Wh/l, the depth of discharge (DOD) is of
</p>
<p>0.5%/day, and their operating temperature is from 0 up to 40 &deg;C, offer relatively
</p>
<p>lower specific energy, is temperature sensitive, each elementary cell develops
</p>
<p>1.2 V and has shorter cycle life. Even if SuperNiCd has better parameters, under
</p>
<p>environmental regulatory scrutiny, the cadmium has been placed, and today
</p>
<p>NiH2 has replaced the NiCd batteries for most space applications;
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.6 The triple junction solar cell and the typical IV characteristic (Spectrolab)
</p>
<p>17 Power Architectures and Power Conditioning Unit &hellip; 501</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; NiH2 batteries were the last 20 years the main option for LEO and GEO
</p>
<p>applications because of their higher medium energy density of 60 Wh/l, having
</p>
<p>a the depth of discharge (DOD) is of 0.5%/day. Each elementary cell develops
</p>
<p>1.2 V and the operating temperature starts at &minus;20 &deg;C support up to 30 &deg;C;
</p>
<p>&bull; Li-ion batteries offer significantly higher specific energy density over that of
</p>
<p>NiH2 (from 150 up to 400 Wh/l) and perform better at low temperatures.
</p>
<p>Modern Li-Ion batteries can operate with good performance in a range between
</p>
<p>&minus;40 and 65 &deg;C. The production cost is relatively high but can be competitive
</p>
<p>with NiH2 in the same volume production. It is vulnerable to damage under
</p>
<p>over-charging or other shortcomings in the battery management. Therefore, it
</p>
<p>requires more elaborate charging circuitry with adequate protection against
</p>
<p>over-charging [15].
</p>
<p>17.2.3 Topologies of the Power Conditioning Unit
</p>
<p>(PCU) for Small Satellites
</p>
<p>The three most common power system implementation approaches found on
</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s small satellites that are presented below are: Direct Energy Transfer
</p>
<p>(DET) with Battery Bus, DET with Regulated Bus and the Maximum Power Point
</p>
<p>Tracker with Battery Bus The following sections describe the operation of each of
</p>
<p>the above systems.
</p>
<p>17.2.3.1 Direct Energy Transfer with Battery Bus (DET-BB)
</p>
<p>This topology is depicted in Fig. 17.7. The DET topology offers simplicity being
</p>
<p>often selected for space missions where the mass is critical. There are no
</p>
<p>switch-mode DC&ndash;DC converters involved in this topology, a major advantage for
</p>
<p>mass (no magnetic components), reliability (no high speed power components) and
</p>
<p>EMI. There are few disadvantages associated with this topology. The battery is
</p>
<p>directly connected to the PV voltage and a larger solar panel is required in this case
</p>
<p>to ensure the proper energy transfer. A larger panel means a higher price for the
</p>
<p>mission. Also in order to avoid excessive losses due to the presence of the Shunt
</p>
<p>Regulator the voltage and operating point of panel should be well known before
</p>
<p>launching.
</p>
<p>17.2.3.2 Direct Energy Transfer with Regulated Bus (DET-RB)
</p>
<p>This second topology is favored by the European Space Agency (ESA) and can be
</p>
<p>found in many European spacecrafts [16]. Typical architecture of this topology is
</p>
<p>depicted in Fig. 17.8. A Sequential Switching Shunt Regulator (S3R) regulates the
</p>
<p>502 S. Oprea et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>bus voltage (V BUS) to a typical value, usually between 24 and 50 V. This
</p>
<p>topology is well suited for missions where the spacecraft experiences extended
</p>
<p>periods of sunlight plus occasional long eclipse period like in case of GEO
</p>
<p>satellites.
</p>
<p>Power flows directly from panels to the bus via the blocking diodes and is
</p>
<p>regulated by S3R regulator during sunlight period. The Battery Discharge Regulator
</p>
<p>(BDR) will keep the bus voltage within regulation limits during eclipses or periods

<p>with high power demand. The DET-RB topology offers high efficiency for
</p>
<p>spacecrafts with medium to high power demands orbiting GEO or GTO. The solar
</p>
<p>arrays must operate at maximum power point for optimum performance of this
</p>
<p>topology. When used in LEO, this power system will require the use of solar arrays
</p>
<p>much larger than that required by an MPPT bus, but for GTO or GEO, the solar
</p>
<p>arrays can be sized for the equilibrium array temperature so that a smaller pro-
</p>
<p>portion of the potential array power is left in the panels.
</p>
<p>The battery must be discharged during eclipses by BDR to a value that ensures
</p>
<p>optimum regulation of the bus voltage by S3R regulator. The BDR is usually
</p>
<p>implemented using a switch-mode DC&ndash;DC converter and this may impact the final
</p>
<p>efficiency of the system especially in case of prolonged eclipses.
</p>
<p>This topology can be implemented using simple components like operational
</p>
<p>amplifiers and comparators already qualified for space operation, which is con-
</p>
<p>sidered a major advantage for larger satellites at higher orbits.
</p>
<p>17.2.3.3 Maximum Power Point Tracker with Battery Bus
</p>
<p>(MPPT-BB)
</p>
<p>This power system architecture uses a different approach. Instead of connect
</p>
<p>directly the output of the solar array to the battery a Maximum Power Point Tracker
</p>
<p>(MPPT) is used now to process the available energy from array. During sunlight the
</p>

<p>capable to track the maximum power point (MPP) of the array. The efficiency of
</p>
<p>this DC&ndash;DC converter should be as high as possible in order to minimize energy
</p>
<p>losses. A small amount of the available energy (5&ndash;10%) will be lost due to this
</p>
<p>converter. However, this architecture may achieve a better overall efficiency
</p>
<p>compared with previous topologies in case of satellites orbiting LEO where the
</p>
<p>array temperature, and hence MPP, changes considerably over the sunlight period
</p>
<p>of the orbit. This topology can be used also for small satellites without pointing
</p>
<p>gimbals where the solar array is not always oriented towards the sun. For GEO
</p>
<p>satellites where there are extended periods of sunlight and solar arrays at equilib-
</p>
<p>rium temperature, the inefficiency of the MPPT would make the use of this
</p>
<p>topology impractical [11].
</p>
<p>This topology is preferred for very small satellites like Cube Sat orbiting on
</p>
<p>LEO. The presence of the MPPT regulator increases the complexity of this
</p>
<p>topology. While the MPPT controller can be implemented in the analog domain
</p>
<p>using simple, space qualified components (operational amplifiers and comparators),
</p>
<p>the best performance of the MPPT algorithms requires digital implementation. The
</p>
<p>presence of a microcontroller or a digital signal processor (DSP) for implementing
</p>
<p>the MPPT algorithms reduces the radiation hardness of the system. This is not
</p>
<p>usually a problem for low cost LEO missions with limited life span.
</p>
<p>17.2.4 Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT)
</p>
<p>The MPPT is a common technique for terrestrial applications due to the typical
</p>
<p>output characteristic of a PV panel. The MPP of the panel depends on many factors
</p>
<p>like the irradiation and operating temperature. MPPT will ensure that the maximum
</p>
<p>available energy is processed and delivered to the load. However, for space
</p>
<p>applications this technique is in many cases avoided. For satellites orbiting high
</p>
<p>orbits the complexity associated with the implementation of MPPT is not justified.
</p>
<p>The orbit parameters are well defined before launching and the power system can be
</p>
<p>designed for optimum performance without the presence of MPPT. Here, archi-
</p>
<p>tectures based on Direct Energy Transfer (DET) are more appropriate as the eclipse
</p>
<p>period is shorter.
</p>
<p>In LEO, where the battery must be charged in a short period, the power point
</p>
<p>tracker (PPT) allows maximum power to be captured for several minutes after each
</p>
<p>eclipse when the array is cold. Architecture without the PPT feature, such as a direct
</p>
<p>energy transfer (DET) bus (as presented in Sects. 17.2.3.1 and 17.2.3.2), would
</p>
<p>waste a significant amount of power, as shown in Fig. 17.10. If DET systems were
</p>
<p>designed to deliver the required power at one-half the illumination at battery&rsquo;s end
</p>
<p>of life (EOL), the power waste would be C-D watts at EOL full sun, B-C-D watts at
</p>
<p>battery&rsquo;s beginning of life (BOL) full sun, and A-B-C-D watts at EOL full sun on a
</p>
<p>cold array. The PPT design eliminates this waste by utilizing all the power that can
</p>
<p>be generated.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The main advantages of the peak power tracking are that it maximizes the solar
</p>
<p>array output power all the time, and it does not require the shunt regulator and the
</p>
<p>battery charge regulator. On the other hand, the MPPT requires a DC&ndash;DC converter
</p>
<p>and there are losses associated with this converter that may affect the efficiency of
</p>
<p>the power system. Moreover, since this loss is dissipated inside the spacecraft body,
</p>
<p>it negatively impacts the thermal system. For very small satellites orbiting LEO the
</p>
<p>power system based on MPPT brings real advantages. This system will maximize
</p>
<p>the utilization of PV panels and due to low energy requirement of these satellites,
</p>
<p>the additional DC&ndash;DC converter losses will not significantly affect the thermal
</p>
<p>system.
</p>
<p>17.2.4.1 The Model of the Solar Cell
</p>
<p>A photovoltaic (PV) cell is basically a large photodiode that will convert the
</p>
<p>incident solar energy to electricity based on the well-known photovoltaic effect. The
</p>
<p>electrical equivalent model of a PV cell is depicted in Fig. 17.11.
</p>
<p>A PV panel is made from n identical cells connected in series, like in Fig. 17.12.
</p>
<p>The current source in Fig. 17.11, isun, is proportional to the amount of irradiation,
</p>
<p>and linear with respect to the PV cell temperature. The current is given by:
</p>
<p>isun &frac14; isun;STC &thorn; ktemp � Tcell � Tcell;STC&eth; &THORN;
� �
</p>
<p>� Psun
Psun;STC
</p>
<p>&eth;17:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>where isun and isun,STC is the short circuit current at the given working point and
</p>
<p>standard test conditions (STC), respectively. The constant ktemp is the temperature
</p>

<p>coefficient of isun. Tcell and Tcell, STC are the actual and STC cell temperatures,
</p>
<p>respectively. Finally, Psun and Psun,STC are the irradiations at the present operating
</p>
<p>point and at STC, respectively [17]. The current through the diode is expressed by:
</p>
<p>id &frac14; iS � e
q�ud
</p>
<p>k�A�Tcell � 1
� �
</p>
<p>&eth;17:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>where iS is the reverse saturation current, A is the diode idealization factor (usually
</p>
<p>defined between 1 and 5), and ud is the voltage across the diode. The PV cell
</p>
<p>equivalent model contains some additional elements, Rp and Rs. These circuit
</p>
<p>elements are associated with parasitic like the connection wires between cells.
</p>
<p>A more detailed description of these parasitic elements is found in [12, 13]. The
</p>
<p>Ccell is the capacity associated with the pn junction of the diode. Finally, the current,
</p>
<p>voltage and power generated by a single PV cell are expressed by:
</p>
<p>icell &frac14; isun � id &eth;17:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>ud &frac14; ucell &thorn;Rs � icell &eth;17:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>Pcell &frac14; ucell � icell &eth;17:6&THORN;
</p>
<p>A family of curves that plot the icell and ucell versus the irradiation is depicted in
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.13. The power delivered by the PV cell under different irradiation condi-
</p>
<p>tions is depicted in Fig. 17.14 [18].
</p>
<p>The power delivered by the PV cell has a maximum at certain voltage and this
</p>
<p>maximum depends on the irradiation. In order to extract the maximum available
</p>
<p>power delivered by the PV panel in certain illumination conditions, a certain
</p>
<p>techniques must be implemented in the system that process the photovoltaic energy.

<p>17.2.4.2 Algorithms for the MPPT
</p>
<p>There are many MPPT algorithms developed during years. Table 17.4 summarize
</p>
<p>the available algorithms and presents their important features and characteristics
</p>
<p>[19, 20]. Simple algorithms like Hill-climbing/Perturb&amp;Observe gain popularity
</p>
<p>over years due to simplicity but suffer from certain drawbacks like inability to
</p>
<p>distinguish between a local and absolute power maximum. The scientific com-
</p>
<p>munity concentrates the efforts to solve various drawbacks associated with simple
</p>
<p>algorithms and finally the complexity of the MPPT grows exponentially. The
</p>
<p>MPPT algorithms become more robust but the complexity and cost of the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation increases substantially. However, for space applications main criteria are
</p>
<p>reliability and simplicity. The MPPT should be able to continuously track the true
</p>
<p>MPP in minimum amount of time and should not require periodic tuning. In this
</p>
<p>case, hill climbing/P&amp;O, fractional VOC or ISC with their low implementation
</p>
<p>complexity are appropriate.
</p>
<p>The Fractional Open-Circuit Voltage Algorithm
</p>
<p>This algorithm is based on the observation that the MPP voltage is a fraction of the
</p>
<p>open voltage of the solar panel.
</p>
<p>UMPP &frac14; K � UOC &eth;17:7&THORN;
</p>
<p>where: UMPP&mdash;MPP voltage, UOC&mdash;open circuit voltage, K&mdash;a constant (usual
</p>
<p>between 0.7 and 0.85 for silicon cells).
</p>
<p>The implementation of this algorithm is depicted in Fig. 17.15. A switch dis-
</p>
<p>connects momentarily the panes from the load and the MPPT bloc measure the
</p>
<p>open circuit voltage of the PV panel. The MPP voltage is estimated using (17.7).
</p>
<p>This simple algorithm requires only one sensor for implementation (voltage sensor).
</p>
<p>The associated are:
</p>
<p>&bull; relative low efficiency of MPPT due to the fact that the K constant cannot be
</p>
<p>very precise determined.
</p>
<p>&bull; when the panel is disconnect from the load, no power flows for a short period of
</p>
<p>time. This may decrease the efficiency of the system.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The inherent low complexity makes this algorithm a potential candidate for
</p>
<p>space applications. The algorithm can be implemented using only analog compo-
</p>
<p>nents, a significant advantage for space applications. However, the presence of a
</p>
<p>microcontroller will increase the flexibility of the MPPT system.
</p>
<p>A simplified version of this algorithm is usually implemented in commercial
</p>
<p>integrated circuits. In this simplified implementation, the MPP voltage is set to a fix
</p>
<p>value by the circuitry and the panel is not disconnected from the load. The MPP
</p>
<p>voltage can be determined from the datasheet of the PV panel or by measurements.
</p>
<p>For very small satellites where the orbit parameters are known this algorithm
</p>
<p>may be a good option. However, the orbit parameters are usually not well defined
</p>
<p>before launching for most very small satellites.
</p>
<p>The Fractional Short-Circuit Current Algorithm
</p>
<p>This algorithm is similar with the previous one and is based on the observation that
</p>
<p>the maximum delivered current for a panel is a fraction of the short-circuit current.
</p>
<p>IMPP &frac14; K*ISC &eth;17:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>where: IMPP&mdash;current at MPP, ISC&mdash;short-circuit current, K&mdash;a constant (usual
</p>
<p>between 0.7 and 0.85 for silicon). The implementation of this algorithm is depicted
</p>
<p>in Fig. 17.16.
</p>
<p>A switch short circuit momentarily the output of the PV panel and the
</p>

<p>The advantages and disadvantages of this algorithm are similar with the frac-
</p>
<p>tional open circuit voltage algorithm. Some topologies of power converters, where
</p>
<p>the main switch is referred to ground like boost and SEPIC, can be used for
</p>
<p>implementation of this algorithm. In this case, the main switch of the converter is
</p>
<p>also used as short-circuit switch for the PV panel.
</p>
<p>The Perturb and Observe Algorithm
</p>
<p>This algorithm is probably the most used for MPPT systems (Fig. 17.17). The main
</p>
<p>advantage of this algorithm is his inherent insensitivity to PV panel parameters and
</p>
<p>operating conditions. The P&amp;O is a high performance algorithm capable to find and
</p>
<p>track the MPP with greater accuracy. This algorithm perturbs the operating point of
</p>
<p>the PV panel and monitors the effects of this perturbation on the output power. If
</p>
<p>the power increases, the perturbation should be kept in the same direction; other-
</p>
<p>wise, it should be reversed [21].
</p>
<p>In order to implement this algorithm, two parameters of the PV panel must be
</p>
<p>measured: the output voltage and the output current. The presence of two sensors
</p>
<p>increases the complexity of the MPPT system (Fig. 17.18).

<p>17.3 A Flexible Architecture of Power Conditioning Unit
</p>
<p>(PCU) for Very Small Satellites
</p>
<p>A flexible, scalable architecture for Power Conditioning Unit (PDU) of very small
</p>
<p>satellites is presented in Fig. 17.19. This architecture can be used for nanosatellites
</p>
<p>and picosatellites on LEO with maximum power requirement up to 50 W. The
</p>
<p>architecture contains the following functional blocks:
</p>
<p>&bull; the Chargers Unit (CU)&mdash;this unit is responsible for processing the power
</p>
<p>available from the PV panels.
</p>
<p>&bull; the Battery Unit (BU)&mdash;this unit contains the main battery of the PCU and the
</p>
<p>associated monitoring electronics (The Battery Charge/Discharge Monitor Unit
</p>
<p>(BCDMU)).
</p>
<p>&bull; the Isolation Unit (IU)&mdash;this unit provides galvanic isolation between the main
</p>
<p>battery unit and the rest of the PCU, a requirement for some missions. This unit
</p>
<p>is optional and can be removed if the mission does not require a galvanic
</p>
<p>isolation.
</p>
<p>&bull; the Point-of-Load/Distribution Unit (POL/D). This unit contains the Point-of-
</p>
<p>Load converters and the distribution switches. This unit includes a variable
</p>
<p>number of converters that produces the required voltages.
</p>
<p>This architecture is well suited for satellites that orbits LEO, where the number
</p>
<p>of eclipses is high and the solar panels experience large temperature variations. The
</p>
<p>system provides the required redundancy for certain satellites as well as some
</p>
<p>advanced features that can be usually found in larger satellites like galvanic iso-
</p>
<p>lation. Each functional subsystem is independent and can be used as a standalone
</p>
<p>building block for simple or more complex applications. For example, the BCU unit
</p>
<p>can be used as a standalone battery charging block for low cost missions, where the
</p>
<p>space and weight is a premium.
</p>
<p>The BCU unit implements a high performance MPPT algorithm and this is an
</p>
<p>important advantage especially for very low cost missions where the orbit can be
</p>
<p>changed just before or during launching and reprogramming of the energy

<p>POL units are implemented using planar magnetics in order to achieve best per-

</p>
<p>17.3.1 The Battery Charger Unit (BCU)
</p>
<p>The Battery Charger Unit (BCU) is the frontend of the proposed architecture.
</p>
<p>The MPPT and battery charger algorithms are implemented by this unit
</p>
<p>(Fig. 17.20).
</p>
<p>Due to the physical dimensions constraints, this board uses fully digital control.
</p>
<p>Digital control offers increased flexibility as most of the control parameters can be
</p>
<p>now adjusted by firmware. The BCU has two functional subunits:
</p>
<p>&bull; the DC&ndash;DC Power Converter, responsible with the energy conversion.
</p>
<p>&bull; the Digital Controller, responsible with the implementation of the MPPT
</p>
<p>algorithm, battery charging algorithm and power converter control.
</p>
<p>The measured parameters are: the input voltage (panel voltage), the input current
</p>
<p>(panel current) and the output voltage (battery voltage). The input voltage and
</p>
<p>current are used for the MPPT algorithm implementation, while the output voltage
</p>
<p>is regulated as part of the battery charging algorithm.

<p>17.3.1.1 The DC&ndash;DC Power Converter
</p>
<p>The DC&ndash;DC power converter uses the synchronous buck converter topology [22].
</p>
<p>This topology offers high conversion efficiency and a good controllability. The
</p>
<p>output voltage is always lower than the input voltage, this topology being recom-
</p>
<p>mended for satellites with larger solar panels like the 2U and 3U CubeSats. For
</p>
<p>satellite with small solar panels like 1U CubeSat, the topology must offer boost or
</p>
<p>buck-boost capability. Such topologies are boost and Single-Ended Primary
</p>
<p>Inductor Converter (SEPIC) [23].
</p>
<p>The power train of the synchronous buck converter is represented in Fig. 17.21.
</p>
<p>The freewheeling diode D is replaced by a synchronously-controlled switch Q2. In
</p>
<p>this case the losses associated with voltage drop on D are greatly reduced, a
</p>
<p>significant advantage for high output current converters.
</p>
<p>The design entry parameters are summarized in Table 17.5. The BCU accepts 7
</p>
<p>to 24 V at input. The output voltage is adjustable between 4.2 V (floating voltage
</p>
<p>for a single cell Li-Ion battery) to 16.8 V (floating voltage of four cells Li-Ion
</p>
<p>battery). The maximum output current is 1.75 A and is adjustable from firmware.
</p>
<p>The switching frequency is fixed, 62.5 kHz but the microcontroller has the option
</p>
<p>to internally adjust this frequency if dithering is required.
</p>
<p>The typical design equations for synchronous buck converter are summarized in
</p>

</p>
<p>The synchronous buck converter requires a specialized driver circuit for
</p>
<p>MOSFETs. In case of the proposed prototype, the MOSFETs drivers are integrated
</p>
<p>into a specialized circuit, the MCP14628. This circuit is specifically designed for
</p>
<p>driving the power MOSFETs of a synchronous buck converter.
</p>
<p>Figure 17.24 presents the internal simplified diagram of this part. This circuit is
</p>
<p>packaged in an 8-pin SOIC package and operates up to 125 &deg;C ambient tempera-
</p>
<p>ture. The MCP14628 driver offers also the diode emulation feature. A specific
</p>
<p>internal circuitry automatically adjust the &ldquo;dead time&rdquo; in order to prevent the
</p>
<p>cross-conduction phenomenon that can occurs if the &ldquo;dead time&rdquo; is missing or is too
</p>
<p>small.
</p>
<p>Notable advantages of the buck converter are:
</p>
<p>&bull; the output voltage has a low ripple/noise, a consequence of the continuous
</p>
<p>output current of the buck converter. This is a significant advantage if the
</p>
<p>switching frequency is relatively low like in case of converters controlled by low
</p>
<p>cost digital systems.
</p>
<p>&bull; the buck converter running in continuous current mode (CCM) has a linear DC
</p>
<p>conversion ratio (M) equal with D (the duty cycle). This is a significant
</p>
<p>advantage if the converter is controlled by low cost digital microcontrollers with
</p>
<p>limited PWM resolution.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; the buck converter has simple small signal model and is very well suited for
</p>
<p>digital control. The non-linear control techniques can be also easily imple-
</p>
<p>mented for this topology. The dynamic response of buck converter is excellent
</p>
<p>being the most used topology for high performance DC&ndash;DC converters.
</p>
<p>The disadvantages of the buck converter are:
</p>
<p>&bull; the input current is discontinuous, creating high ripple/noise on the input volt-
</p>
<p>age. The electrical stress on the input filter capacitor is high.
</p>
<p>&bull; the output voltage is always lower than the input voltage. This may limit the
</p>
<p>usability of this topology for certain applications.
</p>
<p>&bull; the buck converter requires a high-side switch driver. This increases the com-
</p>
<p>plexity and the cost of the schematic. Additionally, the implementation of the
</p>
<p>programmed current mode control (like the peak current mode control) is dif-
</p>
<p>ficult due to the presence of a high-side current sensor. All these problems are
</p>
<p>solved by using monolithic integrated circuits already available from many IC
</p>
<p>producers. However, in this case the flexibility of the system may decrease and
</p>
<p>some advance control (like the implementation of the MPPT) becomes difficult
</p>
<p>to be implemented.
</p>
<p>The buck converter is well suited for space applications either with analog or
</p>
<p>digital control. The only mandatory requirement is that the input voltage (the PV
</p>
<p>panel voltage in this case) should be always higher that the output voltage (the
</p>
<p>battery voltage in case of the proposed prototype).
</p>
<p>17.3.1.2 The Digital Controller
</p>
<p>The digital control of BCU is implemented using a commercial, low pin count
</p>
<p>microcontroller PIC12F1822 developed by Microchip Inc (Fig. 17.25). This
</p>
<p>microcontroller is packaged in an 8-pin package and includes all necessary
</p>
<p>blocks/features to develop a power converter:
</p>
<p>&bull; 10-bit Analog-to-Digital converter with up to four inputs selectable by an analog
</p>
<p>multiplexer
</p>
<p>&bull; digital PWM generator with up to 10-bit resolution
</p>
<p>&bull; low power consumption and advanced power management modes
</p>
<p>&bull; 8 MIPS core computational power
</p>
<p>&bull; internal reference voltage generator
</p>
<p>&bull; extended temperature operating range &minus;40&ndash;125 &deg;C
</p>

<p>microcontroller and the

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The MPPT algorithm implemented in BCU is P&amp;O and the typical block dia-
</p>
<p>gram of the system is depicted in Fig. 17.26. There are two PI controllers, one for
</p>
<p>the P&amp;O algorithm and one that controls the output voltage. This architecture
</p>
<p>prevents the negative effects introduced by the transitions between operating modes
</p>
<p>of the converter (continuous conduction mode CCM and discontinuous conduction
</p>
<p>mode DCM) over the functionality of the P&amp;O algorithm.
</p>
<p>The firmware flowchart is presented in Fig. 17.27. Timer T1 interrupt is used for
</p>
<p>measure the required parameters. The P&amp;O state machine runs inside the main loop
</p>
<p>and is triggered by the Measurements_Done flag set inside T1 interrupt after the
</p>
<p>completion of the measurements. The PI controllers are run inside the T1 interrupt
</p>
<p>and the update of the PWM duty cycle is done also here. The specific charging
</p>
<p>algorithm and protection state machine runs in the main loop.
</p>
<p>The measured parameters are: the input current, the input voltage and the output
</p>
<p>voltage. The output current, necessary for chemistry-specific charging algorithm is
</p>
<p>estimated from the input power. The decision between the two operating modes,
</p>
<p>tracking and regulating, were taking based on the output of the voltage PI
</p>
<p>anti-windup comparator. If the output voltage PI controller is saturated, the system
</p>
<p>is in tracking mode and the P&amp;O loop is executed every 15 ms. The PI controllers
</p>
<p>run simultaneous at 8 kHz.
</p>
<p>The difference equation for each PI controller is (17.10). This equation is tailored
</p>
<p>to be implemented using only shifting operations, a significant advantage for low
</p>
<p>computational power microcontrollers:
</p>
<p>y(T) = 2
m &eth;y(T� 1&THORN;&thorn; 2n e(T&THORN;&thorn; 2k e&eth;T� 1&THORN;&THORN; &eth;17:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>where: e(T) = Vout(T) &minus; Vref, m, n, k&mdash;real integers, y(n)&mdash;output of PI controller.
</p>
<p>This simplified implementation of the PI controller may introduce additional
</p>
<p>constraints for the controlled system. The corresponding s-domain equation is:

<p>17.3.1.3 The BCU Sensors Circuitry
</p>
<p>The BCU unit monitors three parameters: input voltage (panel voltage), input
</p>
<p>current (panel current) and the output voltage (battery voltage). The input voltage
</p>
<p>and the input current are used for the implementation of the MPPT algorithm and
</p>
<p>the output voltage is used for the implementation of the battery-specific charging
</p>
<p>algorithm.
</p>
<p>The input voltage is measured using a voltage divider. The ratio of this divider
</p>
<p>should be adjusted according with the input voltage range in order to maximize the
</p>
<p>dynamic range of the input voltage measurement circuitry. For the input voltage
</p>
<p>range between 9 and 24 V the divider ration is set to 4.7 (100 K with 27 K).
</p>
<p>A small capacitor is placed in parallel with the low-side resistor in order to form a
</p>
<p>low-pass filter that cleans the output of the voltage divider.
</p>
<p>The input current is measured using a 0.1 X low-side shunt placed in series with
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;Negative&rdquo; terminal. An inverting amplifier is used to amplify the voltage drop
</p>
<p>across the shunt and to restore the correct polarity of the current sense signal. The
</p>
<p>gain of this amplifier should be adjusted according with the hardware requirements
</p>
<p>in order to maximize the dynamic range of the current sense circuitry. For the
</p>
<p>proposed prototype, the gain of this amplifier is set to &minus;20X resulting in a con-
</p>
<p>version gain of the current sense circuitry of 2 V/A. A snapshot of the input current
</p>
<p>sense amplifier and the output voltage sense buffer circuits are presented in
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.31. The response of the sense amplifier is set to be of a low-pass filter (with
</p>
<p>pole introduced by C9) in order to provide a clean output signal and reject the noise
</p>
<p>introduced by the switch-mode power converter. The circuit is built around
</p>
<p>MCP6022 dual operational amplifier. The bandwidth of this operational amplifier is
</p>
<p>10 MHz and the maximum operating ambient temperature is 125 &deg;C.
</p>
<p>The output voltage is measured using a voltage divider. Because this divider is
</p>
<p>always connected across the battery voltage and because up to four charger units
</p>
<p>can be connected in parallel in the same time, the values of the resistors are very
</p>

<p>high. This avoids any significant current that can be drawn from the battery during
</p>
<p>eclipses via the measurement divider. The divider ratio can be again adjusted
</p>
<p>according with hardware requirements in order to maximize the dynamic range of
</p>
<p>the output voltage sensing circuitry. A buffer amplifier implemented with the
</p>
<p>second amplifier of MCP6022 is used to avoid any potential errors that may be
</p>
<p>introduced by the leakage currents of the analog input of the microcontroller.
</p>
<p>A small capacitor C11 placed in parallel with R12 forms a low-pass filter that
</p>
<p>rejects the output voltage ripple occurring at the switching frequency of the power
</p>
<p>converter.
</p>
<p>The internal temperature sensor of the microcontroller can be used for measuring
</p>
<p>the temperature of the microcontroller&rsquo;s die which depends on the ambient tem-
</p>
<p>perature and perform a correction of the internal loop parameters (ex. the reference
</p>
<p>voltages for output voltage regulation).
</p>
<p>17.3.1.4 The BCU Prototype
</p>
<p>The prototype of the BCU unit is implemented in a 50 � 35 mm dual layer PCB.
All components were selected with extended temperature range (&minus;40&ndash;125 &deg;C). The
</p>
<p>3D representation of the prototype and associated top PCB layer are represented in
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.32.
</p>
<p>All components are COTS and the radiations hardness tests/reports are
</p>
<p>unavailable for these components. The initial functional tests were conducted in
</p>
<p>laboratory conditions at the ambient temperature (25 &deg;C). The PV can be simulated
</p>
<p>by placing a variable resistor (rheostat) in series with a voltage source. According
</p>
<p>with the maximum power transfer theorem, the maximum power point occurs at the
</p>
<p>half of the voltage of the voltage source.
</p>
<p>The main switching node (source of the high-side MOSFET transistor) and the
</p>
<p>input voltage ripple waveforms are presented in Fig. 17.33.

<p>The battery current is measured using a bidirectional differential amplifier. This
</p>
<p>amplifier allows the measurement of the battery current in both directions: when the
</p>
<p>battery delivers the current to the load or when the battery is charged by the BMU
</p>
<p>units. A shunt of 10 mX is used for the current measurement. The low value of this
</p>
<p>shunt minimizes the associated losses. The gain of differential amplifier is set to
</p>
<p>62.5 (36 dB). By the resistors R2, R3, R4 and R5 and the output of the amplifier is
</p>
<p>centered to about 2.5 V by adding a DC offset. In order to prevent errors introduced
</p>
<p>by low Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMMR) the gain set resistors R2, R3, R4
</p>
<p>and R5 should be matched within 0.1%. Gain of this amplifier can be adjusted for
</p>
<p>different batteries currents for maximizing the dynamic range of the measurement
</p>
<p>circuit. A low-pass filter that rejects the high frequency noise is constructed with the
</p>
<p>aid of C1 and C2. The output of this amplifier is clamped in order to avoid damage
</p>
<p>of the microcontroller analog input using the circuit constructed with R6 and D2.
</p>
<p>For proposed prototype, the gain of the current sense amplifier is set to 0.625 V/A.
</p>
<p>The battery temperature is measured by using a thermistor usually attached to the
</p>
<p>battery&rsquo;s body. The thermistor provides a very wide measurement range (usually
</p>
<p>exceeding 150 &deg;C) and is very well suited for space applications. The output
</p>
<p>characteristic is non-linear (Fig. 17.38) and the microcontroller should perform a
</p>
<p>linearization operation for accurate temperature measurement. The thermistor used
</p>
<p>in the proposed prototype is of NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) type. The
</p>
<p>nominal value of this thermistor is 10 kX.

<p>17.3.2.3 The Battery Switch
</p>
<p>A power switch is placed between the BCDMU and the rest of the system. The role
</p>
<p>of this switch is to protect the battery against severe overload, deep discharge or
</p>
<p>accidental discharge during launch process. The power switch is implemented using
</p>
<p>a P-channel MOSFET and is activated by pulling his gate to the ground potential.
</p>
<p>The schematic of this switch is depicted in Fig. 17.39.
</p>
<p>A resettable PTC fuse is placed in series with the battery positive terminal in
</p>
<p>order to protect against severe overcurrent that can potentially occurs if the other
</p>
<p>protections become inoperative.

<p>17.3.2.4 The Battery Heater
</p>
<p>If the battery&rsquo;s temperature drops below a certain level usually specified by man-
</p>
<p>ufacturer, the capacity can be severely affected. In order to prevent this phe-
</p>
<p>nomenon that can occurs during eclipses, the BCDMU can activate a heater circuit
</p>
<p>if the measured temperature is below a specified threshold. The heater circuit can
</p>
<p>provides up to 200 mA current and the thresholds can be programmed inside the
</p>
<p>BCDMU firmware.
</p>
<p>17.3.2.5 Telemetry System
</p>
<p>The Telemetry, tracking and telecommand (TT&amp;C) system measures and reports
</p>
<p>various parameters of the battery. The parameters are available via the I2C interface
</p>
<p>provided by the BCDMU.
</p>
<p>The I2C interface provides support for 100 or 400 kHz data rates. The number
</p>
<p>format uses the mantissa/exponent format in order to achieve good resolution
</p>
<p>without using floating point format numbers. The exponent is fixed, equal with
</p>
<p>ten [25].
</p>
<p>Table 17.8 presents the BCDMU telemetry system set of commands.
</p>
<p>The general packet structure is represented in Fig. 17.40. The slave address is
</p>
<p>fixed for each unit and can be set in firmware. The BCDMU firmware provides a
</p>
<p>mechanism for error detection in the form of a CRC-8 generally known as &ldquo;Packet
</p>
<p>Error Check&rdquo; (PEC). This PEC byte is optionally and the firmware will automat-
</p>
<p>ically check for the presence of this byte.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;COM_BAT_VOLTAGE&rdquo; (0x01) command is used to read the battery volt-
</p>
<p>age. The battery voltage is reported directly in volts.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;COM_BAT_CURRENT&rdquo; (0x02) command is used to read the battery current.
</p>
<p>The battery current is reported as a signed value as the battery can deliver current
</p>
<p>during eclipses and absorb current during charging phase.

<p>capacity. The read value is a signed number that represents the capacity directly in

</p>
<p>in order to calibrate the coulomb counting block of BCDMU.

<p>17.3.3 The Effects of Space Radiation on Electronic
</p>
<p>Components
</p>
<p>The space is a harsh environment. All electronic components, semiconductor
</p>
<p>materials and assemblies are affected by this environment. The main factor that
</p>
<p>causes this is the space radiation. There are four major components that form the
</p>
<p>space radiation:

<p>&bull; Trapped electrons found in the Van Allen Outer Belt. These are negatively
</p>
<p>charged particles with low mass but high energy (up to 7 meV). Trapped
</p>
<p>electrons can be found on orbits with high altitude like GEO (mostly telecom
</p>
<p>satellites and GPS).
</p>
<p>&bull; Trapped protons found in the Van Allen Inner Belt. These are positively charged
</p>
<p>particles held captive by the Earth magnetosphere. Can have energies up to
</p>
<p>400 meV and dominates the low orbits (LEO).
</p>
<p>&bull; Solar particles. These are protons and heavy ions ejected from the Sun during
</p>
<p>solar flares. The energy of these particles is high enough to produce damages to
</p>
<p>electronics and the occurrence is essentially unpredictable.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cosmic rays. They are produced by some galactic phenomena like supernovae
</p>
<p>and contain particles with very high energy (sometimes up to 1020 eV). The flux
</p>
<p>is relatively low, 4 particles/cm2/s.
</p>
<p>There are two major categories of effects generated by space radiation on
</p>
<p>materials used for electronic devices:
</p>
<p>&bull; Cumulative effects. Long term exposure to space radiation produces a pro-
</p>
<p>gressive degradation of semiconductor materials. There are two major effects
</p>
<p>related to long term exposure: the Total Ionization Doze (TID) and
</p>
<p>Displacement Damages [DD]. The TID is measured in grey [SI] or rad [CGI]
</p>
<p>and indicates the accumulated doze where the electrical parameters of a semi-
</p>
<p>conductor device start to degrade. For radiation-hardened devices TID is
</p>
<p>between 100 krad (Si) and 1 Mrad (Si) while for COTS are between 1 krad
</p>
<p>(Si) and 100 krad (Si) (mostly below 30 krad (Si)). The displacement damages
</p>
<p>are produced by high energy particles that affect the lattice structure of the
</p>
<p>semiconductor.
</p>
<p>&bull; Single event effects. These effects are produced by a single high-energy particle
</p>
<p>that passes the semiconductor structure and disturb the normal functionality of
</p>
<p>the device. There are few categories of single event effects:
</p>
<p>&bull; Single Event Upset (SEU). This disturbance affects mostly the digital circuitry
</p>
<p>especially memories and is essentially non-destructive. The particle may change
</p>
<p>the state of a memory cell producing a temporary malfunction of the circuit or
</p>
<p>data loss.
</p>
<p>&bull; Single Event Latch-Up (SEL). This disturbance affects the circuitry that pre-
</p>
<p>sents the latch-up phenomenon like CMOS. Essentially the particle trigger the
</p>
<p>latch-up into the semiconductor structure and the current drawn by the device
</p>
<p>may become very large and uncontrollable. The SEL can produce destructive
</p>
<p>effects unless the current drawn by device is limited.
</p>
<p>&bull; Single Event Transient (SET). Here the particle produces a temporary dis-
</p>
<p>turbance of a parameter like a voltage or current. Mostly affects the analog
</p>
<p>circuitry like the voltage regulators but may also affect indirectly the digital
</p>
<p>circuits.
</p>
<p>&bull; Single Event Burnout (SEB). This is the most dangerous single-event effect
</p>
<p>because produces permanent failure of the semiconductor structure. Is often
</p>
<p>17 Power Architectures and Power Conditioning Unit &hellip; 535</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>triggered by a SEL and if the current into device is not limited the temperature of
</p>
<p>the semiconductor structure will exceeds the safety limit.
</p>
<p>For low cost, limited time space missions the cumulative effects are not a
</p>
<p>problem. However, the single event effects may severely affect the mission and
</p>
<p>some countermeasures against these effects are always necessary.
</p>
<p>17.3.4 Countermeasures Against the Effects of Space
</p>
<p>Radiation
</p>
<p>The cost of a space mission is very high and in this context the reliability of the
</p>
<p>electronic systems became of critical importance. A short list of specific techniques
</p>
<p>used for preventing catastrophic failure due to space radiation:
</p>
<p>&bull; Use of radiation-hardened components. These are specially developed com-
</p>
<p>ponents capable to sustain large doses of radiation without significant degra-
</p>
<p>dation of electrical parameters. The cost of these components is very high and
</p>
<p>the availability is limited. The typical development cycle is between five and
</p>
<p>seven years and the testing and validation effort is significant. Space agencies
</p>
<p>regularly publish documents with radiation tests done for various components.
</p>
<p>&bull; Redundancy. Redundancy is the primary option for increase the reliability of
</p>
<p>critical mission blocks or assemblies. Redundancy is obtained when more
</p>
<p>components than a specific operation needs are placed in a specific configuration
</p>
<p>so that in case that one component fails another takes instantaneously its place
</p>
<p>and the functionality is preserved. This method involves high cost and cannot be
</p>
<p>implemented for all components and assemblies for example the solar array and
</p>
<p>batteries. For very small LEO satellites this option is somehow limited by the
</p>
<p>cost and the mass/dimensions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Shielding. Shielding is an effective way to protect the electronic components
</p>
<p>against the effects produced by low-mass particles (electrons). The electronic
</p>
<p>assemblies can be covered by metal shields aluminum being the primary option
</p>
<p>due to its low mass. Shielding is not effective against large mass, high energy
</p>
<p>particles like those from the cosmic rays.
</p>
<p>17.3.5 Reliability of Low-Cost Designs Based on COTS
</p>
<p>The proposed PCU is entirely built with COTS. While the radiation tolerance of
</p>
<p>COTS is in most of the cases unknown there are few techniques that can improve
</p>
<p>the reliability of electronic blocks built using these components.
</p>
<p>The redundancy is primary option also in case of low-cost designs. In case of the
</p>
<p>proposed PCU there are three functional blocks that involves redundancy:
</p>
<p>536 S. Oprea et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; The Battery Charger Unit (BCU). There are four independent BCU units in this
</p>
<p>design. Each BCU is designed with a typical 30% power reserve.
</p>
<p>&bull; The Battery Charge/Discharge Monitor Unit (BCDMU). There are two
</p>
<p>BCDMU units that can run in parallel each one with his own battery. The
</p>
<p>telemetry system is independent for each BCDMU.
</p>
<p>&bull; The Isolation Unit (IU). There are two independent IU with outputs connected in
</p>
<p>parallel.
</p>
<p>The effects induced by SEU can be minimized by using a special technique in
</p>
<p>firmware. This technique involves the use of redundant code: critical code is exe-
</p>
<p>cuted multiple times and the results are checked by a voter. The same variable is
</p>
<p>stored in three different locations and the voting system decides if this variable was
</p>
<p>affected by SEU. All constants are stored in the non-volatile memory of micro-
</p>
<p>controller and fetched before being used in code.
</p>
<p>The most dangerous phenomenon for low-cost, COTS-based designs is SEL.
</p>
<p>SEL can produce severe malfunctions to the systems and is the primary cause for
</p>
<p>failure of these systems. The SEL can be prevented by using latch-up proof com-
</p>
<p>ponents and designs. Unfortunately most of the COTS components based on
</p>
<p>CMOS technology are not latch-up proof. In this category enters microcontrollers,
</p>
<p>volatile and non-volatile memories often used by low-cost designs. The counter-
</p>
<p>measures against SEL include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Use of the &ldquo;Watch Dog&rdquo; circuits. This circuit can reset the microcontroller in
</p>
<p>case of a malfunction produced by SEL. In order to be effective the &ldquo;Watch
</p>
<p>Dog&rdquo; is usually combined with other circuits like voltage supervisors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use of the input current monitors. These circuits are able to detect an over-
</p>
<p>current that typically occurs in case of a latch-up and can be used to cycle the
</p>
<p>input power of the protected device. This kind of protection is effective against
</p>
<p>SEL and their circuitry can be implemented using radiation-hardened
</p>
<p>components.
</p>
<p>17.4 Conclusions
</p>
<p>In this chapter a brief overview about the characteristics and specific demands of
</p>
<p>very small satellites together with their electrical power system topologies are firstly
</p>
<p>presented. The proposed flexible hybrid power is then introduced and only the
</p>
<p>power conditioning unit that includes the battery charger unit (BCU) and the battery
</p>
<p>charge/discharge monitor unit (BCDMU) are further detailed for a specific appli-
</p>
<p>cation of a very small satellite similar to a CubeSat.
</p>
<p>The battery charger unit (BCU) includes the DC&ndash;DC synchronous Buck con-
</p>
<p>verter, the digital controller implemented using a commercial, low pin count
</p>
<p>microcontroller and the BCU sensors&rsquo; circuitry that monitors three parameters:
</p>
<p>input voltage (panel voltage), input current (panel current) and the output battery&rsquo;s

<p>voltage. The input voltage and the input current are used for the MPPT imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of the P&amp;O algorithm and the output voltage is used for the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of the battery-specific charging algorithm. At the end of this subchapter,
</p>
<p>the BCU prototype is explained from the practical perspective of the built
</p>
<p>prototype.
</p>
<p>The battery charge/discharge monitor unit (BCDMU) contains at its turn a 16-bit
</p>
<p>low power microcontroller, the BCDMU&rsquo;s sensors circuitry that monitors other
</p>
<p>three battery parameters: voltage, current and temperature, the battery switch power
</p>
<p>whose role is to protect the battery against severe overload, deep discharge or
</p>
<p>accidental discharge during the launch process, the battery heater activated during
</p>
<p>eclipses in order to prevent battery&rsquo;s temperature drops below a certain level and
</p>
<p>finally the telemetry, tracking and telecommand (TT&amp;C) system that measures and
</p>
<p>reports various parameters of the battery available via the I2C interface provided by
</p>
<p>the BCDMU. The blocks described above are completely functional, being the
</p>
<p>subject of a national program, according to acknowledgements below.

<p>Abstract The need for high power density has been the trend of the power con-
</p>
<p>version industry for many years. The key to obtain a high power density is to
</p>
<p>increase system&rsquo;s efficiency. In the case of space applications, there is the same
</p>
<p>need for high power density but with the very important note that the reliability of
</p>
<p>the system must not be compromised. In order to increase system&rsquo;s efficiency while
</p>
<p>maintaining reliability, the latest soft switching converter topologies, high power
</p>
<p>density packaging, improved heat extraction and planar magnetics are used. Other
</p>
<p>key parameters are: the digital loop control and the digital energy management
</p>
<p>through microcontrollers, and digital signal controllers.

<p>In space, examples of a mission-critical system are: the navigation system for a
</p>
<p>space mission, or the electric power system (conversion and management).
</p>
<p>Electrical energy is one of the vital elements in keeping a satellite operational in
</p>
<p>orbit. Solar panels convert solar energy into electrical energy. From there, the
</p>
<p>electrical energy is processed, stored, regulated and distributed to electronic loads
</p>
<p>which consist mainly of analog and digital semiconductors, RF, optical, sensors,
</p>
<p>lasers and electromechanical devices. To underline the importance of the electrical
</p>
<p>power system in space applications as a mission-critical system whose failure would
</p>
<p>compromise the whole mission of any satellite, European Space Agency
</p>
<p>(ESA) briefly states that &ldquo;a satellite without electricity is nothing but space junk&rdquo; [1].
</p>
<p>In Chap. &ldquo;Power Architectures and Power Conditioning Unit for Very Small
</p>
<p>Satellites&rdquo;, an introduction in very small satellites (characteristics, Earth orbits and
</p>
<p>eclipses, Cube Sats brief presentation and missions) was made and some blocks of
</p>
<p>the electrical power system were discussed (the solar array, batteries for space
</p>
<p>applications, space power architectures, maximum power point tracker) and
</p>
<p>developed (the flexible architecture of the power conditioning unit). In this chapter
</p>
<p>focused on space power conversion units and energy management strategies, a brief
</p>
<p>presentation of space requirements for power conversion is introduced and the
</p>
<p>advanced technology of planar transformers&mdash;as part of the power conversion
</p>
<p>units&mdash;is detailed. Then, all the other remaining blocks of the satellite&rsquo;s electrical
</p>
<p>power system from the above mentioned chapter (the intermediate bus converter
</p>
<p>and the adiabatic point of load power converter) are developed, together with the
</p>
<p>power management block that links all the component blocks in both chapters. In
</p>
<p>the end, the original prototype of the whole energy management system for a very
</p>
<p>small satellite application is exposed, as the best obtained variant of practical
</p>
<p>demonstrator for the architectures, technologies, algorithms, methods, devices etc.
</p>
<p>presented in both chapters.
</p>
<p>18.1 Overview of Space Requirements for Power
</p>
<p>Conversion Units
</p>
<p>The technology of power electronics for space applications has special peculiarities.
</p>
<p>The most remarkable difference between power electronics for space and the ter-
</p>
<p>restrial environment one consists of space radiation. Power semiconductor devices
</p>
<p>such as MOSFET can fail after exposure to heavy ions due to SEGR (single event
</p>
<p>gate rupture) or SEBP (single event burnout phenomenon). Also controlling
</p>
<p>semiconductor integrated circuits (Ics) such as microcontrollers, microprocessors,
</p>
<p>analog to digital converters and sensors can suffer from heavy ions exposure,
</p>
<p>causing faulty data which may lead to catastrophic failure. To stress this even
</p>
<p>further, just considering one single bit alteration in the microcontroller&rsquo;s memory
</p>
<p>can lead to abnormal behavior of the control system, which can distort the control
</p>
<p>loop, which in the end may lead to damaging the electronic loads.
</p>
<p>18 Power Conversion and Energy Management &hellip; 543</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Converters are generally required to operate continuously in the radiation
</p>
<p>environment without damage and performance degradation with accumulative total
</p>
<p>ionizing doze (TID) in the range of 2&ndash;3 kiloradiatios (Krads) to 100 Krads or more.
</p>
<p>TID level is mission dependent. Also required is the converter&rsquo;s ability to survive
</p>
<p>and recover from singe event phenomena (SEE), e.g. single event upset (SEU),
</p>
<p>single event latch up (SEL) and single event burnout (SEB). The typical SEE level
</p>
<p>is linear energy transfer (LET) or 37&ndash;83 meV-cm2/mg. SEE level is mission
</p>
<p>dependent, too. Other radiation requirements may include performance under
</p>
<p>neutron, proton, and high doze rate radiation. However, these requirements are
</p>
<p>unique to strategic weapon applications. Table 18.1 lists the typical requirements of
</p>
<p>a space DC-DC converter [2].
</p>
<p>Unlike terrestrial applications, where mass and volume may not always be a big
</p>
<p>concern, space applications require the most compact and light design possible,

<p>Power system&rsquo;s thermal dissipation is a limiting parameter for power electronics
</p>
<p>design. Unlike the design for terrestrial applications, there is no atmosphere which
</p>
<p>leads to no convection process in outer space. Only conduction and radiation
</p>
<p>cooling can be used, which makes a lot of cooling methods unavailable in space
</p>
<p>applications.
</p>
<p>Space power systems must be very reliable, must maintain their functionality
</p>
<p>and have failure isolation capability. Power system failures can be temporary or
</p>
<p>permanent. Temporary failures include overheating and non-damaging memory
</p>
<p>corruption due to radiation. Overheating can be addressed by the controller through
</p>
<p>power derating or temporary latch. Memory corruption can be addressed by a
</p>
<p>governing watchdog which reboots the process when corruption is detected. In
</p>
<p>order to prevent permanent failures, key system parameters are closely monitored
</p>
<p>by the controller. Such parameters include temperatures in key component areas,
</p>
<p>memory coherence, voltage and current levels and power levels. The controller
</p>
<p>makes judgments to implement predictive maintenance. The mean time between
</p>
<p>failures (MTBF) calculation of such a power systems should exceed the mission
</p>
<p>lifetime. To successfully implement this, the individual components&rsquo; electrical and
</p>
<p>thermal derating levels must be kept lower than the terrestrial 80%.
</p>
<p>Some electronic components are restricted for space usage due to their inherent
</p>
<p>small lifetime. Such components, especially electrolytic and film capacitors, must
</p>
<p>be replaced by ceramic, tantalum or mica capacitors. Optoelectronic devices are
</p>
<p>also restricted for space usage due to electroluminescent effects caused by radiation.
</p>
<p>For mechanical restrictions, vibrations and thermal cycles impose larger footprints
</p>
<p>and components that are not soldered underneath. For example, chip film resistors
</p>
<p>and ceramic capacitors have a minimum footprint of 0805. For controller ICs, the
</p>
<p>footprint should be SOIC, TQFP or larger. Accepted transistor footprints are
</p>
<p>TO-252 or larger.

<p>18.2 Technological Trends of High Power Density
</p>
<p>Converters for Space Applications
</p>
<p>For the last few decades the focus of power subsystems development and
</p>
<p>advancement has revolved around the needs and requirements of large high power
</p>
<p>missions, mainly for telecommunication applications. The challenges to increase
</p>
<p>efficiency and simultaneously to reduce mass and volume in this application are
</p>
<p>valid, but for small satellite missions these challenges have been overlooked. From
</p>
<p>the power system&rsquo;s perspective, it is safe to say that the power challenges and
</p>
<p>requirements are common across the full spectrum of small satellite missions. Small
</p>
<p>satellites can have a range of power requirements from as little as 1 or 2 W to a
</p>
<p>few kW. As a result, there is a need for the power systems&rsquo; electronics to be
</p>
<p>compatible with a multitude of mission profiles and to be scalable in power han-
</p>
<p>dling capability.

<p>The trends presented in this chapter are focused on planar magnetics and their
</p>
<p>variable width winding structures, which are very good candidates for various
</p>
<p>power supply applications, including space power converters.
</p>
<p>18.2.1 Variable Width Winding Concept Summary
</p>
<p>Power density (or volume power density, or volume specific power) is the amount
</p>
<p>of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume. The trend toward high
</p>
<p>power density, high operating frequency, and low profile in power converters
</p>
<p>determined the appearance of limitations regarding the use of conventional
</p>
<p>wire-wound transformers. An alternative to conventional wire-wound transformers
</p>
<p>are planar transformers, which exhibit a unique set of advantages: good thermal
</p>
<p>characteristic, higher power density and low leakage inductance. The increase of
</p>
<p>power density is obtained by increasing the switching frequency which decreases
</p>
<p>the size of the passive components. However, this increase of the switching fre-
</p>
<p>quency creates a different set of problems regarding the skin and proximity effects
</p>
<p>of the transformer windings, especially with frequencies over 100 kHz [3]. The
</p>
<p>finite element analysis simplifies the computation of the DC and AC losses in the
</p>
<p>windings. Also analytical approach is presented in [4]. In [5] a comparison between
</p>
<p>simulation and analytical results for magnetic components is made. Windings with
</p>
<p>variable width turns are considered in [6], but they are not experimentally con-
</p>
<p>firmed. The limitations of planar transformer designs are the subject of [7, 8].
</p>
<p>In this chapter the DC and AC resistance of the windings have been analyzed via
</p>
<p>a finite element analysis, and a novel variable width winding concept is compared
</p>
<p>to the fixed with winding approach. The variable winding widths are chosen so the
</p>
<p>winding exhibits the same DC resistance per turn and so balancing the magnetic
</p>
<p>flux. This optimized variable width winding brings an improvement at DC and AC
</p>
<p>frequencies. Combined with a 10 W LLC application, the classical constant width
</p>
<p>and variable width windings are compared and the detailed experimental results are
</p>
<p>shown.
</p>
<p>18.2.2 Design with Constant Width Planar Winding
</p>
<p>The design process for a constant width planar winding is very straight forward.
</p>
<p>According to the desired application, the core size and type are chosen in the
</p>
<p>beginning. For a 10 W LLC converter, a Ferroxcube E32/6/20 3F3 core meets the
</p>
<p>requirements. The turn ratio of the transformer according to the input and output
</p>
<p>voltage needs are Np = 6 turns for the primary and Ns = 2 turns for the secondary.
</p>
<p>The design has a 2 layer structure with the primary and secondary windings on
</p>
<p>separate layers.
</p>
<p>18 Power Conversion and Energy Management &hellip; 547</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For the E32/6/20 core, the winding window is 9.19 mm. The effective winding
</p>
<p>window is obtained by introducing 0.5 mm of tolerance in each side resulted from
</p>
<p>the ferrite core and PCB manufacturing tolerances. The resulted effective winding
</p>
<p>window is wind = 8.19 mm.
</p>
<p>Building the transformer on a 2 layer structure assumes that the copper thickness
</p>
<p>(CT) should be set to a typical printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturer capability
</p>
<p>of 3 oz. This thickness dictates the distance between turns (x), which will be
</p>
<p>x = 0.3 mm. The primary winding width will be:
</p>
<p>Wprim &frac14;
wind � Np � 1
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>� x
Np
</p>
<p>; &eth;18:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>which computes to Wprim = 1.115 mm.
</p>
<p>Starting from (18.1), a similar equation for the secondary winding constant
</p>
<p>width can be found:
</p>
<p>Wsec &frac14;
wind � Ns � 1&eth; &THORN; � x
</p>
<p>Ns
; &eth;18:2&THORN;
</p>
<p>resulting in Wsec = 3.945 mm.
</p>
<p>Once the winding widths have been determined, in order to calculate the DC
</p>
<p>resistance, the windings length has to be determined. Due to the shape of the ferrite
</p>
<p>core, the winding has a rectangular shape. Additional parameters need to be defined
</p>
<p>the winding length calculation (Fig. 18.1) are: t&mdash;turn number, L&mdash;center core leg
</p>
<p>length, l&mdash;center core leg width, Lt&mdash;partial winding length, lt&mdash;partial winding
</p>
<p>width.
</p>
<p>The partial long length for a turn t is:
</p>
<p>Lt &frac14; L&thorn; 2t � w&thorn; 2t � 1&eth; &THORN; � x &eth;18:3&THORN;
</p>
<p>and for the short length t is:
</p>
<p>lt &frac14; l&thorn; 2t � w&thorn; 2t � 1&eth; &THORN; � x &eth;18:4&THORN;
</p>
<p>Equations (18.3) and (18.4) apply for primary and secondary constant width
</p>
<p>windings and combining them the total length for t = 6 turns primary winding can
</p>
<p>be determined:
</p>

<p>The DC resistances for the constant width design will be: Rprimcons &frac14; 59:727 mX
and Rsec cons &frac14; 5:801 mX.
</p>
<p>18.2.3 Proposed Design with Variable Width Winding
</p>
<p>Method
</p>
<p>The variable with winding design begins with the assumption that the resistance of
</p>
<p>each turn is equal to each other. By maintaining this assumption, the flux is bal-
</p>
<p>anced between the windings having the same current flowing through each turn. For
</p>
<p>simplicity only the primary winding will be a variable width. In Fig. 18.2 the
</p>
<p>complete transformer assembly is shown.
</p>
<p>Step 1: Design starts by choosing the width of the first inner turn w1 &frac14; 0:9 mm,
according to [6]. This will be a temporary value and will be adjusted. In order to
</p>
<p>comply with the maximum winding space the following in equation must be
</p>
<p>fulfilled:
</p>
<p>Np � 1
� �
</p>
<p>� x&thorn;
X
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>t&frac14;1
wt �wind; &eth;18:9&THORN;
</p>
<p>meaning that the sum of all widths and winding distances must not exceed the
</p>
<p>maximum winding window. The relation between widths will be dictated by a
</p>
<p>multiplier coefficient y, as it follows:
</p>
<p>w1 &frac14; 0:9 mm
w2 &frac14; w1y
. . .
</p>
<p>wn &frac14; wn�1y

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>where y &frac14; 1:085 is chosen for Np = 6 turns and winding window of wind = 8.19
mm to satisfy (18.9). Based on the calculations above the temporary winding
</p>
<p>widths can be determined.
</p>
<p>Step 2: Is to calculate the winding lengths, using the same (18.3) and (18.4) as for
</p>
<p>the constant with design. Since the resistance of each turn needs to be calculated,
</p>
<p>the average length of each turn, which is a similar calculation to the (18.3)&ndash;(18.5)
</p>
<p>but with a variable with introduced, is calculated:
</p>
<p>Lavgt &frac14; 2 � L&thorn; 2t � wt &thorn; 2 � 2t � 1&eth; &THORN; � x&thorn; lt &thorn; l&thorn; 2t � wt&frac12; � &eth;18:11&THORN;
</p>
<p>Having the widths and average lengths of each turn calculated the resistance per
</p>
<p>turn is:
</p>
<p>Rt &frac14; q �
Lavgt
</p>
<p>CT � wt
&eth;18:12&THORN;
</p>
<p>Step 3: Is to equalize the resistances. The simplest way of doing this is by using a
</p>
<p>mathematical calculation program like Mathcad and use (18.9), (18.10), (18.11) and
</p>
<p>(18.12). Two parameters can be adjusted: the inner winding with w1 and the
</p>
<p>multiplier coefficient y. When the two conditions are fulfilled (the resistance is the
</p>
<p>same per turn and the maximum winding window is not exceeded), the calculation
</p>
<p>is over. For a six turn variable winding, the winding resistances per turn results are
</p>
<p>as follows:
</p>
<p>R1 &frac14; 8:781 mX; R2 &frac14; 8:707 mX; R3 &frac14; 8:628 mX
R4 &frac14; 8:545 mX; R5 &frac14; 8:458 mX; R6 &frac14; 8:368 mX
</p>
<p>The total DC resistance for the variable with is be: Rprimvar &frac14; 57:487 mX.
</p>
<p>18.2.4 Comparisons Between Designs via FEA Simulations
</p>
<p>As a result from subchapter above, the DC resistance of the proposed variable width
</p>
<p>design has a 3.5% lower resistance that the constant width design. A finite element
</p>
<p>analysis is performed on the constant width and variable width designs. An AC
</p>
<p>magnetostatic solver is used. The excitation is a sinusoidal current of 1A peak
</p>
<p>amplitude which applies to both primary and secondary windings.
</p>
<p>At a first instance to obtain the DC resistance of the windings, the solver fre-
</p>
<p>quency is set to 0 Hz. To solve for skin and proximity effects the solver frequency
</p>
<p>has to be the operating design frequency of the converter, in our case 170 kHz. The
</p>
<p>result is an impedance matrix containing the resistance, inductance and coupling at
</p>
<p>the solver frequency. Results of FEM simulations are provided in Table 18.2.
</p>
<p>18 Power Conversion and Energy Management &hellip; 551</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In order to avoid the saturation of the core a small distributed air gap is intro-
</p>
<p>duced. The simulation results from Table 18.2 are performed with a core gap of
</p>
<p>0.22 mm. To make a proper comparison between the two winding designs, it is
</p>
<p>critical that the windings have to be at the same distance to the core gap. If the
</p>
<p>winding is placed closer to the gap, the AC effects increase due to the magnetic field
</p>
<p>cutting into the copper.
</p>
<p>Following the results of Table 18.2, a 2.8% improvement of the variable width
</p>
<p>design is noticed in the primary winding resistance at 170 kHz frequency compared
</p>
<p>to the constant width design. There is a good agreement between the simulated
</p>
<p>results and Chap. 2.2 theoretical results for the DC resistance. In Fig. 18.3 the
</p>
<p>current density plots of the primary windings for both designs are presented where
</p>
<p>almost no difference in current density for the variable width design is noticed,
</p>
<p>meaning that there are no strangulation points with the variable width turns.

<p>18.3 Intermediate Bus and POL Architectures, Topologies
</p>
<p>and Control Mechanisms
</p>
<p>18.3.1 Intermediate Bus and POL Architectures
</p>
<p>The purpose of the intermediate bus converter is to be a buffer between the solar
</p>
<p>array, battery and point of load converters.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.4 shows the relationship between the input stage DC-DC converter
</p>
<p>and the output stage DC-DC POL. The figure depicts three types of voltage rela-
</p>
<p>tions between these two: (a) regulated intermediate bus, (b) unregulated interme-
</p>
<p>diate bus and (c) double regulated intermediate bus [9]. In the case of regulated
</p>
<p>intermediate bus, the input stage converter regulates the bus voltage (Vib) via a
</p>
<p>feedback loop. The output stage converter operates at fixed parameters (duty cycle
</p>
<p>and frequency). In the case of unregulated intermediate bus, the input stage con-
</p>
<p>verters operate at fixed parameters (duty cycle and frequency) and the output stage
</p>
<p>converter regulates the load voltage via a feedback loop. In the case of double
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.4 Intermediate Bus and POL architectures
</p>
<p>18 Power Conversion and Energy Management &hellip; 553</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>regulated intermediate bus the input stage converter regulates the voltage using a
</p>
<p>feedback loop and the output stage converter also regulates the load voltage using
</p>
<p>its own feedback loop. For output voltage requirements of &plusmn;10%, the regulated
</p>
<p>intermediate bus can be used, while the unregulated intermediate bus is capable of
</p>
<p>&plusmn;5% regulation. For a regulation of lower than &plusmn;5%, double regulated intermediate
</p>
<p>bus (DRIBA) is preferred, due to its increased transient capabilities.
</p>
<p>Depending on the input voltage range and/or input voltage regulation or
</p>
<p>quasi-regulation, there are several possible topologies for this type of application
</p>
<p>and all of them are isolated DC-DC converters. The most used topology is the two
</p>
<p>Transistor Forward but new cutting edge topologies which obtains higher efficiency
</p>
<p>include Critical Conduction Flyback and LLC that will be also discussed further.
</p>
<p>18.3.2 Two Transistor Forward Converter
</p>
<p>The two switch forward converter is chosen as a classical candidate because it is
</p>
<p>considered to be one of the most reliable converters yet. Its benefits include the
</p>
<p>following: bulletproof operation (no timing issues or dead time requirements and no
</p>
<p>chance of shoot-through), no MOSFET body-diode conduction under any condi-
</p>
<p>tion, no snubber circuitry required, the voltage stress on the main MOSFETs is
</p>
<p>limited to the maximum supplied voltage and simplicity of operation over a wide
</p>
<p>range of input voltages and load conditions.
</p>
<p>Some of the few drawbacks of the two transistor forward topology are that it
</p>
<p>requires two transistors and two fast recovery diodes. It also requires a larger
</p>
<p>transformer and output inductor.
</p>
<p>It is falsely stated in many application notes [9, 10] that this topology can&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>operate in zero-voltage switched (ZVS) mode. ZVS is easily achieved by con-
</p>
<p>trolling the amplitude of the primary magnetizing current. Slight modulation in
</p>
<p>switching frequency enables the control of the magnetizing current. The transfer
</p>
<p>function equation for the two transistor forward is:
</p>
<p>Vout &frac14; Eff � Vin � D � N; &eth;18:13&THORN;
</p>
<p>where: Vout&mdash;the output voltage, Eff&mdash;the targeted efficiency, Vin&mdash;the input
</p>
<p>voltage, D&mdash;converter&rsquo;s duty cycle, N&mdash;the transformer turns ratio.
</p>
<p>The popular power levels chosen for this converter are in the range of 150 to
</p>
<p>750 W. The basic operation is as follows: Fig. 18.5a shows transistors Q1 and Q2,
</p>
<p>which turn on together transferring energy through the transformer&rsquo;s primary to the
</p>
<p>secondary. On the secondary side, the forward rectifying diode conducts, trans-
</p>
<p>ferring energy into the output filter and load.
</p>
<p>When transistors Q1 and Q2 are turned off, the transformer magnetizing current
</p>
<p>flows through the now forward biased diodes D1 and D2 and then back into the
</p>
<p>source, as shown by Fig. 18.5b. The diodes conduct until all the magnetizing
</p>
<p>energy in the primary along with energy stored in the leakage inductances is
</p>
<p>554 A.-S. Savu et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>returned to the input supply. Since diodes D1 and D2 clamp the input voltage, no
</p>
<p>snubber circuits are required. On the secondary side, the forward rectifying diode
</p>
<p>conducts, transferring the output inductor stored energy into the load.
</p>
<p>During the non-power delivery cycle of the primary, proper transformer reset
</p>
<p>time is achieved when the on-time is less than its off-time. As a result, the primary
</p>
<p>winding itself acts as the reset winding. Having the off-time longer than the
</p>
<p>on-time, the transformer will always reset. For this reason, the duty cycle of the two
</p>
<p>switch forward converter does not exceed 50%.
</p>
<p>As for any isolated DC-DC converter, a proper design begins with the trans-
</p>
<p>former, which is typically the main source of efficiency loss in the system. In the
</p>
<p>case of the two switches forward, the full input voltage is applied on the primary
</p>
<p>winding for a certain amount of time. In this case, the cross-section and core
</p>
<p>volume of the transformer have to be chosen in such a way to minimize core loss
</p>
<p>and copper loss. A good transformer design will have similar copper and core loss
</p>
<p>values. Transformer leakage inductance has to be minimized by winding inter-
</p>
<p>leaving techniques since the leakage is decreasing the effective duty cycle.
</p>
<p>The output inductor contains in most of the cases only DC current since the AC
</p>
<p>current amplitude is small. As a result, the inductor flux swing is low and core loss
</p>
<p>is negligible. Copper losses can be optimized by carefully designing the inductor.
</p>
<p>The two primary switches have conduction losses and switching losses.
</p>
<p>Switching losses are depending on the chosen switching frequency and imposes a
</p>
<p>limitation in increasing it. The two primary clamping diodes typically exhibit low
</p>
<p>conduction losses. The rectifier diodes in the secondary side exhibit conduction
</p>
<p>losses and reverse recovery losses. They can be replaced with synchronous rectifiers
</p>
<p>which increase the system efficiency but also complicate the driving circuitry. The
</p>
<p>output capacitors exhibit ESR conduction losses especially when there is a high AC
</p>
<p>current ripple in the output inductor.

<p>18.3.3 Quasi Resonant Flyback Converter
</p>
<p>The classical flyback topology has a fundamental advantage over all other isolated
</p>
<p>topologies: its ability to operate over large input voltage ranges. This may easily
</p>
<p>apply to our satellite power system since the solar panel output voltage varies with
</p>
<p>sunlight, eclipses and temperature. The typical power levels for this converter are in
</p>
<p>the range of 5 up to 150 W.
</p>
<p>The flyback converter operating in continuous conduction mode has several
</p>
<p>fundamental problems, which are: the leakage inductance voltage spike occurring
</p>
<p>on the main primary switch, transformer with typically low efficiency due to high
</p>
<p>AC losses, high switching losses in the main switch and reverse recovery losses in
</p>
<p>the secondary rectifier. However, the small component count makes this topology
</p>
<p>very desirable, since the mass and volume, which are key parameters in satellite
</p>
<p>applications, are lower than for other topologies [11].
</p>
<p>Figure 18.6a depicts the flyback converter schematic. To improve the con-
</p>
<p>verter&rsquo;s efficiency the converter is operated in discontinuous conduction mode
</p>
<p>(DCM). This flyback converter is called quasi-resonant flyback or variable fre-
</p>
<p>quency flyback or valley switching flyback, and this is largely used in low power
</p>
<p>switched mode power supply (SMPS) applications such as chargers, adapters and
</p>
<p>auxiliary supplies. This is also a good candidate for the intermediate bus converter.
</p>
<p>The converter stores energy in the primary magnetizing inductance with the
</p>
<p>main switch is on. In the meantime, output voltage is supplied by the output
</p>
<p>capacitor and the energy from the secondary winding. When the energy in the
</p>
<p>secondary winding is depleted, the output voltage is supplied only by the output
</p>
<p>capacitors. During this period, because the primary switch is off and the secondary
</p>
<p>rectifier is not conducting, there will be a ringing between the transformer leakage
</p>
<p>inductance, transformer intra-winding capacitance and the switch&rsquo;s output capaci-
</p>
<p>tance, as in Fig. 18.6b.
</p>
<p>The voltage across the main switch will experience a minimum valley point,
</p>
<p>whose minimum value will depend on the flyback reflected voltage. By turning on
</p>
<p>the main switch at this minimum valley, the flyback is called quasi-resonant or
</p>

<p>valley switching flyback. To maintain this operation mode, the frequency is
</p>
<p>adjusted depending on the load.
</p>
<p>The transfer function equation of the DCM flyback is:
</p>
<p>Vout &frac14; Vin � N � D �
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
</p>
<p>Rload
</p>
<p>2 � Lp � fsw
</p>
<p>s
</p>
<p>; &eth;18:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>where: Vout&mdash;the output voltage, Vin&mdash;the input voltage, N&mdash;the transformer turns
</p>
<p>ratio, D&mdash;converter&rsquo;s duty cycle, Rload&mdash;the converter load resistance, Lp&mdash;the
</p>
<p>primary inductance value, fsw&mdash;the converter&rsquo;s switching frequency.
</p>
<p>One of the most critical components in any flyback is the transformer design.
</p>
<p>Since the operation mode is slightly different from any other isolated converter, the
</p>
<p>transformer acts as a storage device and is delivering power to the output when the
</p>
<p>main switch is off. The secondary winding is exposed to the magnetic field created
</p>
<p>by the primary winding, thus having increased AC conduction losses. This applies
</p>
<p>also to the primary winding being in the magnetic field of the secondary winding,
</p>
<p>also creating AC conduction losses. The AC losses increase is more significant in
</p>
<p>the quasi-resonant design.
</p>
<p>Minimizing the leakage inductance is a must in any flyback transformer design.
</p>
<p>This can be achieved by proper winding interleaving. The leakage inductance
</p>
<p>creates a voltage spike on the main primary switch. This is often dampened by the
</p>
<p>use of RCD snubbers.
</p>
<p>The primary switch exhibits both conduction loss and switching loss. By turning
</p>
<p>on the switch at the minimum valley voltage, the switching losses decrease. This is
</p>
<p>one of the main advantages of using a quasi-resonant flyback. The secondary
</p>
<p>rectifier exhibits conduction losses and reverse recovery losses, the latter being
</p>
<p>eliminated by operation in quasi-resonant mode. The output capacitor exhibits ESR
</p>
<p>conduction losses.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.7 shows the switching waveforms for a Flyback converter used as an
</p>
<p>intermediate bus converter.
</p>
<p>18.3.4 LLC Converter
</p>
<p>Operation at higher switching frequencies reduces the size of passive components
</p>
<p>such as transformers and filters. Switching losses have been the main obstacle to
</p>
<p>achieve high frequency operation. Switching losses are directly proportional with
</p>
<p>switching frequency. Resonant converters have been in the power supply industry
</p>
<p>for more than 20 years. One of the most successful resonant topology which
</p>
<p>emerged is the LLC type. Its main advantages are that it obtains Zero Voltage
</p>
<p>Switching (ZVS) on the primary side switches and Zero Current Switching
</p>
<p>(ZCS) on the secondary side rectifiers [12]. The typical power levels for the LLC
</p>
<p>converter can be between 50 W and 1KW.
</p>
<p>18 Power Conversion and Energy Management &hellip; 557</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The power supply gain is controlled by changing the switching frequency.
</p>
<p>The LLC resonant converter contains a resonant network. This network is con-
</p>
<p>sisted, as the name implies from two inductors and a capacitor. Figure 18.8 defines
</p>
<p>a resonant inductor Lr and a shunt inductor Lm and also a resonant capacitance Cr.
</p>
<p>The resonant inductor can be the leakage inductance of the transformer, or a
</p>
<p>discrete inductor, or both in series. The shunt inductor is the magnetizing induc-
</p>
<p>tance of the transformer. If the primary side of the converter is used in a half-bridge
</p>
<p>configuration, the resonant capacitor value is the sum of the two bridge capacitor
</p>
<p>values. The resonant tank contains two resonant frequencies:

</p>
<p>where Lp is the sum of the shunt inductor and the series inductor, and Lr is the
</p>
<p>resonant inductor. To maintain ZVS conditions the converter must be designed to
</p>
<p>operate with a switching frequency higher than fp, ideally fp + (10&ndash;20%) margin.
</p>
<p>A particularity of this converter is that by operating around the resonant fre-
</p>
<p>quency f0, the gain characteristic is almost independent of the load, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.9 [12].
</p>
<p>Analyzing Fig. 18.9, depending on the primary side we can identify conduction
</p>
<p>losses in switches Q1 and Q2, conduction losses in Lr winding, transformer
</p>
<p>windings and also in the ESR of the resonant capacitor. The secondary side rec-
</p>
<p>tifiers can be diodes or synchronous rectifiers. If operated above the resonant fre-
</p>
<p>quency fp, there are theoretically no switching losses, one of the main advantages of
</p>
<p>this topology. Contrary to other topologies, a larger leakage inductance value will
</p>
<p>not affect the performance since the leakage inductance value is absorbed in the
</p>
<p>series inductor.
</p>
<p>This topology is a good candidate for an intermediate bus converter because of
</p>
<p>its load independent constant gain while operated at the resonant frequency f0. The
</p>
<p>main drawback of this topology is that the RMS current values in both primary side

<p>and secondary side are higher than typically operated PWM converters and also the
</p>
<p>peak values of the voltage and currents are higher, thus requiring higher component
</p>
<p>derating values.
</p>
<p>18.3.5 Control Mechanisms of Power Converter Units
</p>
<p>Controlling a power DC-DC converter unit is always dependent on the topology,
</p>
<p>transient needs and other factors required. Control mechanisms can be achieved via
</p>
<p>analog control, digital control or mixed analog-digital control [13, 14].
</p>
<p>Traditionally, analog control was used to generate the drive signals, feedback
</p>
<p>loop and other auxiliary needs. Some of the main advantages of analog control were
</p>
<p>the low quiescent power and very fast feedback loops. The disadvantages are the
</p>
<p>high number of discrete components, higher susceptibility to electrically induced
</p>
<p>noise and few reconfiguration options. As things evolved, IC manufacturers built
</p>
<p>integrated analog controllers, which are very good tools in building power supplies.
</p>
<p>However, they offer little flexibility and their usage is standard.
</p>
<p>As things evolved, digital control gained popularity, now being the most used
</p>
<p>control mechanisms. The advantages are numerous, while the disadvantages are
</p>
<p>low and decreasing. Advantages come from the fact that there is usually a
</p>
<p>user-programmable microprocessor core connected to numerous digital and analog
</p>
<p>peripherals, which offer large flexibility. Such peripherals include high-speed
</p>
<p>analog-to-digital converters, fast digital and analog comparators, high performance
</p>
<p>pulse width modulation (PWM) signal generators, which often allows dead time
</p>
<p>compensation and many other tweaks. Having all those peripherals backed by a
</p>
<p>microprocessor results in designing fast digital feedback loops, temperature and
</p>
<p>voltage protection, as well as powerful communication.
</p>
<p>Some of the drawbacks of using a microcontroller are that depending on the need
</p>
<p>for computation power (i.e. how fast the feedback loop needs to be), the current
</p>
<p>consumption may be higher. Also, for multi-output power supplies, the micro-
</p>
<p>controller may not have sufficient computation power to drive multiple output, each
</p>
<p>with its own loop, if we&rsquo;re talking about voltage regulation, or loops if both the
</p>
<p>voltage and the current needs to be regulated.
</p>
<p>Mixed analog and digital control usually incorporates both a user-programmable
</p>
<p>digital microprocessor and analog circuitry. The microprocessor usually handles
</p>
<p>communication, faults, temperature measurements, alarms and signal driving, while
</p>
<p>the analog circuitry provide a fast response feedback loop, with a reference set by
</p>
<p>the microprocessor. This allows for lower power consumption on the micropro-
</p>
<p>cessor (no need to process lot of signals) and very high transient performance of the
</p>
<p>power supply.
</p>
<p>Feedback control mechanisms used vary from the simplest On/Off control, to PI
</p>
<p>and PID loops, N pole M zero controls, Sliding Mode Controllers and Fuzzy logic.
</p>
<p>Any of these can be implemented in a microcontroller, with standard C or
</p>
<p>Assembly programming, or mixed C-ASM. The reason for using mixed C-ASM
</p>
<p>560 A.-S. Savu et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>coding is: state machines, alarms and communication require usually more complex
</p>
<p>thinking but are not time critical. For this reason C code (which after compiling, the
</p>
<p>output is usually less efficient) is a perfect candidate, while feedback loops and
</p>
<p>cycle by cycle current limiting are written directly in Assembly because of the time
</p>
<p>constraint. Other advantages in doing this is the fact that though the microcontroller
</p>
<p>has enough processing power to allow the user to write C-code over the entire
</p>
<p>firmware, having efficient code allows the possibility of tuning the processor clock
</p>
<p>down and reduce overall power consumption.
</p>
<p>18.4 Adiabatic Point of Load Modern Concept for Space
</p>
<p>Applications
</p>
<p>In thermodynamics, the &ldquo;adiabatic&rdquo; term refers to a system that doesn&rsquo;t change
</p>
<p>(gain or loss) heat with the exterior surroundings. Starting from this definition, an
</p>
<p>adiabatic point of load technology refers to an ultrahigh efficiency that forces the
</p>
<p>power converter to virtually produce no heat when processing the power, which is
</p>
<p>essential in space applications where no atmosphere exists for heating dissipation
</p>
<p>[15]. Applied in the electrical power systems for the existing satellites whose
</p>
<p>end-to-end efficiency in payloads doesn&rsquo;t exceed today 65%, this new, modern and
</p>
<p>of ultrahigh efficiency technology promises to bring the advantages of no heat
</p>
<p>removal and constant temperature [16].
</p>
<p>An illustrated explanation of this adiabatic technology concept is presented in
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.10a, where the adiabatic region has a slope of minimum 97% efficiency
</p>
<p>(ideally, at least 98.5%). It can be observed that both cost reduction and efficiency
</p>
<p>improvement are simultaneously achieved. With an efficiency improvement of only
</p>
<p>1.3% the throughout power doubles, as is shown in Fig. 18.10b.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In Fig. 18.11a the adiabatic POL design block diagram is presented and it can be
</p>
<p>observed that its overall architecture is similar with the Buck synchronous
</p>
<p>converter/rectifier, whose electrical diagram results from the basic Buck converter
</p>
<p>diagram from Fig. 18.11b if diode D1 is replaced with another switch similar to the
</p>
<p>switch S1, thus significantly reducing losses and optimizing the overall conversion
</p>
<p>efficiency [17].
</p>
<p>Point of Load (POL) or Point of Use (POU) is emerging solutions for applica-
</p>
<p>tions in which circuits require low voltages of 3.3 V and below. As it was shown
</p>
<p>above, the most popular POL topology is the Buck converter. Stepping down the
</p>
<p>voltage from the bus voltage of for example 48 to 1 V or lower will require a very
</p>
<p>low duty cycle, which will result low converter efficiency. For this reason, to obtain
</p>
<p>a good power system efficiency the POL must have in front of it an intermediate bus
</p>
<p>converter as Fig. 18.4c with a double regulated intermediate bus architecture
</p>
<p>shows. With this type of architecture both the bus converter and the POL converter
</p>
<p>can reach higher efficiencies and, with both tightly regulated, system&rsquo;s end-to-end
</p>
<p>efficiency and static and dynamic performances are improved to the level of the
</p>
<p>needed adiabatic region in Fig. 18.10a.
</p>
<p>Typically, the bus voltage for space applications is 12 V. The Buck converter is
</p>
<p>the most basic SMPS circuit. It is also called a DC transformer without galvanic
</p>
<p>isolation since it&rsquo;s a non-isolated topology. The Buck topology has several modes
</p>
<p>of operation: continuous conduction mode, boundary conduction mode and dis-
</p>
<p>continuous conduction mode. Depending on the load current and specific appli-
</p>
<p>cation, the converter can be designed to operate in one or more of these three
</p>
<p>modes. The Buck converter is widely used in Voltage Regulated Module
</p>
<p>(VRM) applications, where the output voltage is low and the load current is very
</p>
<p>high. This is similar the requirements of mission critical power levels. A good part
</p>
<p>of this proven technology can be borrowed from the VRM technology. For high
</p>
<p>current applications, the Buck POL will operate in continuous conduction mode and
</p>
<p>fixed frequency with variable duty cycle. For lower load current and higher voltage
</p>
<p>applications, the Buck POL will operate in discontinuous conduction mode with
</p>
<p>variable switching frequency and variable duty cycle.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.11b shows synchronous Buck converter&rsquo;s components which are:
</p>
<p>switches Q1 and Q2 (in the VRM technology, Q2 is placed instead diode D2 of the

<p>classical Buck converter in order to improve efficiency), output filter L and C and
</p>
<p>input resistance Rload. In the case of synchronized rectification, the main switch
</p>
<p>and the synchronous rectifier have a complementary drive signal, resulting in the
</p>
<p>fact that at low duty cycles (for switch Q1), the synchronous rectifier receives most
</p>
<p>of the load current. The implementation of a synchronous rectifier switch allows the
</p>
<p>converter to operate in discontinuous conduction mode with a negative rectifier
</p>
<p>current. This negative current allows the two switches to operate under zero voltage
</p>
<p>switching mode and eliminate the switching losses. This mode of operation has the
</p>
<p>drawback of introducing a large AC current ripple in the output inductor L which
</p>
<p>translates into AC winding inductor losses and increased inductor core loss. This is
</p>
<p>the reason that for high currents operation in discontinuous mode is less efficient.
</p>
<p>Decreasing the size of the POL has been a challenge in the industry for many
</p>
<p>years, POL efficiency has always been the limiting factor for this. New advance-
</p>
<p>ments in semiconductor technologies such as the use of Gallium Nitride
</p>
<p>(GaN) devices allow the increase of the switching frequency and reduction of the
</p>
<p>magnetic component size [18, 19]. Low voltage GaN switching devices, which can
</p>
<p>be employed in the POL are compared by similar silicon device in Table 18.3.
</p>
<p>These two devices are typical devices specifically designed to be used in POL
</p>
<p>converters. The GaN switching devices have an advantage over similar silicon
</p>
<p>devices in terms of parasitic capacitances, which is significantly lower than silicon
</p>
<p>counterpart.
</p>
<p>For the same Drain-to-Source maximum voltage the GaN exhibits a lower
</p>
<p>conduction resistance. It also exhibits a 40% lower gate charge, which decreases the
</p>
<p>driving losses. This advantage becomes more significant at a higher switching
</p>
<p>frequency. The GaN device output capacitance is almost half of the silicon coun-
</p>
<p>terpart, meaning that there will be efficiency advantages for the POL in both
</p>
<p>operating modes. Zero voltage switching is easier to obtain in discontinuous con-
</p>
<p>duction mode because of the lower output capacitance requiring less negative cir-
</p>
<p>culating current. In continuous conduction mode the drain-to-source voltage spike
</p>
<p>on the switching device is lower.

<p>Operation in continuous conduction mode has a fundamental problem in both
</p>
<p>cases using either rectifying diode or synchronous rectifier because of the reverse
</p>
<p>recovery losses. In each case this also creates voltage spikes on the switching
</p>
<p>devices. The main advantage of the GaN switching device is that it experiences zero
</p>
<p>reverse recovery charge, thus allowing POL operation for high currents at high
</p>
<p>switching frequencies. The voltage spike amplitude reduction due to the zero
</p>
<p>reverse recovery charge allows the usage of lower voltage switching devices, which
</p>
<p>have an inherent lower RDS(ON) and as a result increases efficiency. In Fig. 18.12
</p>
<p>we can see power density and efficiency improvements by using GaN transistors
</p>
<p>instead of conventional silicon ones for a typical POL application running at the

<p>switching frequency of 1 MHz. Low voltage GaN devices are being priced at
</p>
<p>comparable level with the silicone ones which makes them to be taken into account
</p>
<p>for new designs [20, 21].
</p>
<p>Briefly, the trend for POL converters is to decrease the size, increase the effi-
</p>
<p>ciency and increase the power density. The ultimate goal is that the converter not to
</p>
<p>require heat transfer to the surrounding environment. In order for the POL to run in
</p>
<p>an adiabatic environment, the power dissipation must be controlled, temperatures
</p>
<p>monitored at all times and considering no air flow, the only possible cooling is done
</p>
<p>via conduction and radiation.

<p>18.5 Energy Management and Experimental Results

<p>A power system configuration composed by an intermediate bus converter and one
</p>
<p>or more POL converters must have a governing &ldquo;brain&rdquo;, which monitors the overall
</p>
<p>system by knowing exactly each blocks status. This governing function is per-
</p>
<p>formed by one or several controllers. In case of multiple controllers, they must be
</p>
<p>able to establish bidirectional communication between them.

<p>In this overall power arrangement there are two or more isolation areas. As
</p>
<p>already stated before, the intermediate bus converter provides the isolation
</p>
<p>boundary which is defined by a primary side and a secondary side. The POL is
</p>
<p>located in the secondary side isolation.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 18.13a the power distribution/management system for very small satel-
</p>
<p>lites is presented. As also the picture shows, it is composed of four redundant
</p>
<p>battery charging units (BCU), two battery management units (BMU), two redun-
</p>
<p>dant intermediate bus converters, three POL converters and the management unit
</p>
<p>with two microcontrollers (the primary controller and the secondary controller). The
</p>
<p>system is designed to have four independent solar panels at its inputs and to supply
</p>
<p>three galvanic isolated output voltages of 5, 3.3 and 1.2 V. The total combined
</p>
<p>output power is designed to be 50 W. Also is has a 14.4 � 16.8 V four cell LiIon
battery pack connection, which is charged from the solar panels and also supplies
</p>
<p>the output power when the panels are in shade or malfunctioning. Figures 18.14
</p>
<p>and 18.15 describe the software flowchart for the primary side and secondary side
</p>
<p>controllers. The two intermediate bus converters have two system controllers, one
</p>
<p>for the primary side and the other for the secondary side. The secondary side

<p>controller is also responsible for regulating the voltages on the POL stages. The
</p>
<p>chosen topology for the intermediate bus converter shown here is the Flyback
</p>
<p>topology. The Flyback is chosen because of its ability to have a large input voltage
</p>
<p>range needed for our application and because it has no need for an output inductor
</p>
<p>and thus saving space on the PCB. The transformers are implemented using planar

<p>magnetic technology, which is more common in military applications and server
</p>
<p>applications. This was chosen because of inherent cooling capabilities, and better
</p>
<p>mechanical rigidity, especially in the cases of transportation vibrations. There are
</p>
<p>two intermediate bus converters for redundancy purposes. Each one has its own
</p>
<p>analog controller which drives and regulates the output bus voltage. As can be seen
</p>
<p>in Fig. 18.14, these analog controllers can be turned on and off by the primary
</p>
<p>system controller. In the same time, this controller can assume the drive and reg-
</p>
<p>ulation functions, fully replacing the analog control by digital control.
</p>
<p>At the end of each Flyback converter there is a protection stage called an ORING
</p>
<p>stage. This ORING stage technology is borrowed from telecom industry, where
</p>
<p>multiple DC-DC converters are paralleled into a single bus. The classical approach
</p>
<p>is for each converter to have an ORING diode. The main drawback of this repre-
</p>
<p>sents the high power dissipation on the diode. In the latest power systems, this
</p>
<p>diode has been replaced with a high-side MOSFET switch with low RDS(ON). This
</p>
<p>switch is controlled by an analog ORING controller, which monitors the switch
</p>
<p>current and disables the switch if the current becomes negative. A negative current
</p>
<p>in the switch indicates a converter fault which creates a short circuit path to ground.
</p>
<p>The basic function of the ORING controller is to disconnect this current path to
</p>
<p>ground, thus disconnecting and isolating the faulty stage from the bus.
</p>
<p>The primary controller also has a temperature monitoring array of sensors for
</p>
<p>both Flyback intermediate bus converters. Any detection of an abnormal temper-
</p>
<p>ature will trigger an internal fault state which decides whether to completely shut
</p>
<p>down the stage or run it in a power derating mode. The primary controller performs
</p>
<p>an under voltage and over voltage lockout function in case the bus converter input
</p>
<p>voltage is outside the accepted specifications.
</p>
<p>The primary controller communicates with the secondary controller via a
</p>
<p>bi-directional digital isolator. Since optoelectronic components are not accepted for
</p>
<p>mission-critical space applications due to their sensitivity to radiation and fast
</p>
<p>aging, the chosen isolator with magnetic transformers.
</p>
<p>The POL stages, have a regulated input bus voltage of 12 V and output voltages
</p>
<p>of 5, 3 and 1.8 V. They are digitally controlled and regulated by the secondary side
</p>
<p>controller. The output current for the 5 V POL is 6 A, for the 3.3 V POL is 9 A and
</p>
<p>for the 1.8 V output is 10 A.
</p>
<p>As depicted in Fig. 18.15, the secondary controller independently reads the
</p>
<p>output power for each POL and monitors the bus voltage. It also has a temperature
</p>
<p>monitoring function, buy monitoring the temperature of each POL. The secondary
</p>
<p>controller can receive fault signals from the primary controller and can control the
</p>
<p>ORING stages. In the case of an intermediate bus converter fault, the primary
</p>
<p>controller sends information to the secondary sides which must react and disconnect
</p>
<p>the faulty stage. This is a redundant protection in case the ORING controller fails to
</p>
<p>turn off the output switch.
</p>
<p>The primary controller can also send to the secondary controller a temperature
</p>
<p>warning information in the case the intermediate bus converters are getting close to
</p>
<p>the maximum temperature limit, such as the secondary controller will prepare to go
</p>
<p>into a power derating mode for the POL loads which allow it. If the POL load does
</p>
<p>18 Power Conversion and Energy Management &hellip; 567</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>not allow power derating mode, then the secondary controller will completely shut
</p>
<p>down the entire POL stage. The secondary controller can send information to the
</p>
<p>primary side regarding the bus voltage. If the bus voltage is out of the required
</p>
<p>specification, the secondary controller will send a shutdown command to the pri-
</p>
<p>mary controller.
</p>
<p>One of the most innovative features of the whole system is that the regulated
</p>
<p>intermediate bus voltage can be adjusted to make the POL converters operating
</p>
<p>under the most efficient conditions and/or make the Flyback intermediate bus
</p>
<p>converter run more efficiently. In the scenario of a high load situation for the POLs,
</p>
<p>with one of the POL stage goes close to the critical operation temperature, and the
</p>
<p>Flyback stage is in normal operating temperature, the secondary controller will ask
</p>
<p>the primary controller for a lower bus voltage, decreasing the POL power losses and
</p>
<p>decreasing the POL temperature. This works both ways, in the case that if the
</p>
<p>Flyback reaches the critical operating temperature while the POL is in the nominal
</p>
<p>operating temperature, the primary controller inquires the secondary controller for
</p>
<p>POL temperature values. If the POL temperatures are in the nominal regions, the
</p>
<p>primary controller decides to increase the bus voltage, which reduces the Flyback
</p>
<p>output current, increases its efficiency and inherently lowers the Flyback
</p>
<p>temperature.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.16 shows the intermediate bus converter efficiency curve versus dif-
</p>
<p>ferent loading conditions.
</p>
<p>The flyback intermediate bus converter operates in critical conduction mode
</p>
<p>using primary winding feedback. The control method is current mode control.
</p>
<p>Because of this mode of operation, voltage switching for the main primary side
</p>
<p>switch can be obtained.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.17 shows the efficiency graph of the POL 5 V Vout converter. The

<p>18.6 Conclusions
</p>
<p>Different requirements from conventional power conversion are imposed due to the
</p>
<p>critical nature of space applications. Any failure will likely trigger a chain of events
</p>
<p>which may lead to cancelling the mission. Component size restrictions are different
</p>
<p>from conventional power systems, which, in order to achieve lower end price and
</p>
<p>higher efficiency, use smaller and more high density and novel parts, which are
</p>
<p>usually smaller, like smaller resistors and capacitors and ball grid array
</p>
<p>(BGA) footprints. Especially in space power systems, components have a larger
</p>
<p>footprint in order to withstand the vibration stress.
</p>
<p>In most mission-critical applications there is limited cooling available due to the
</p>
<p>fact of operation in extreme environments such as the vacuum of space, high
</p>
<p>altitude, lower or higher pressure and lower or higher temperatures. In such cases,
</p>
<p>efficiency of the power system is a key parameter in the design. The packaging of
</p>
<p>the converter is a challenge to design because in the operation in harsh environ-
</p>
<p>ments the power system needs to be protected from outside elements, but also its
</p>
<p>inputs and outputs need to be protected with rated connectors. To improve pack-
</p>
<p>aging, planar magnetics are the future trend as a replacement for conventional
</p>
<p>magnetics. The advantages include lower profile, improved cooling, reduced par-
</p>
<p>asitic elements and high repeatability in production. System miniaturization is
</p>
<p>possible by the use of the planar magnetics and digital control. This feature is very
</p>
<p>important for power management units designed especially for very small satellites.
</p>
<p>The most proven power stage topologies can be imported from conventional
</p>
<p>power systems. Also the control schemes can be imported from conventional power
</p>
<p>systems, with an emphasis on parameters monitoring and redundancy. In order to
</p>
<p>improve converter efficiency new GaN devices can be employed. Intelligent power
</p>
<p>processing such as intelligent voltage buses help increase the overall power system

<p>Determining the Optimal Battery Model
</p>
<p>for a Specific Application
</p>
<p>Bogdan-Adrian Enache
</p>
<p>Abstract Determining the optimal battery model for a specific application is a
</p>
<p>complex process that must take into account several factors: the type of application,
</p>
<p>the accuracy required, the degree of complexity, etc. This chapter introduces a new
</p>
<p>method for determining the optimal model and has its starting point in analyzing the
</p>
<p>discharge profile, and employs a multi-criteria analysis for processing the experi-
</p>
<p>mental data. The method presented is validated experimentally for a LiFePO4 battery
</p>
<p>subjected to discharge after anUrbanDynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycle.

<p>developments of the PCB were made in order to extend is applicability not only to
</p>
<p>safety issues but also to better energy efficiency and so the Battery Management
</p>
<p>System (BMS) was born.
</p>
<p>These devices receive as input the operating parameters of the battery, and based
</p>
<p>on the logic that they implement, ensure the extraction of the maximum capacity of
</p>
<p>the battery within the boundaries specified by the manufacturer. Due to the complex
</p>
<p>processes that occur within the battery, some of these parameters, such as State of
</p>
<p>Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH), cannot be measured directly. However,
</p>
<p>these characteristics are critical for the energy efficiency of the battery, therefore
</p>
<p>they must be assessed by a different method. Currently, the most widely used
</p>
<p>method for determining the SoC and SOH is by approximating them based on a
</p>
<p>model of the battery operation. By embedding such a model into the BMS a
</p>
<p>significant improvement in battery capacity during discharge is achieved [1].
</p>
<p>The main strategies of developing a functional model of the battery are the
</p>
<p>electrochemical approach and the approach oriented towards electric circuits, but
</p>
<p>there are also models that combine elements of both strategies.
</p>
<p>The electrochemical models are based on the description of the processes
</p>
<p>occurring within the battery. They are used to explain the electrochemical phe-
</p>
<p>nomena occurring when the electrode interacts with the electrolyte [2]. Therefore
</p>
<p>they make use of differential equations systems with several unknowns. Using a
</p>
<p>computer to solve the equation systems gives rise to algebraic loops that need
</p>
<p>approximation methods to remove them and also to reduce the number of param-
</p>
<p>eters involved. The big advantage of the electrochemical models is their high
</p>
<p>accuracy. Using such a model in [3] is obtained, for a Li-ion battery, an error
</p>
<p>smaller than 0.01% to approximate the SoC.
</p>
<p>The models based on circuits use electrical and electronic components to
</p>
<p>describe the behaviour of the battery subjected to discharge. They have as a
</p>
<p>common source the Rint (elementary) model, which is composed only of a DC
</p>
<p>voltage source and a resistor set in series. Starting from this, other models have
</p>
<p>been developed by adding parallel resistor-capacitor branches. The accuracy of the
</p>
<p>most popular models based on electric circuits is analyzed in [3] which reports for a
</p>
<p>LiMn2O4 battery that is subjected to discharge at constant current a maximum
</p>
<p>relative error in determining the SoC between 0.1 and 0.35%. Unlike the electro-
</p>
<p>chemical models, the models based on electric circuits have lower accuracy, but
</p>
<p>their easy development and implementation makes them ideal for incorporation into
</p>
<p>simulation programs.
</p>
<p>The analytical models are models that combine properties of the electrochemical
</p>
<p>models and of the models based on circuits. Their aim is to develop a model that
</p>
<p>contains a small number of equations and a high accuracy, while at the same time
</p>
<p>being easy to use in other programs.
</p>
<p>Because of the fact that models are being developed along three different
</p>
<p>directions, choosing the optimal model is a complex issue, which must take into
</p>
<p>574 B.-A. Enache</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>account many factors, of which the most important are: the scope of the application,
</p>
<p>the degree of accuracy and the time required to make the model.
</p>
<p>In order to develop a BMS for portable devices, where the accuracy of the model
</p>
<p>used is not the most important parameter, but rather the ability to run in real-time on
</p>
<p>embedded systems, simple models based on electric circuits are the ideal solution
</p>
<p>[4, 5].
</p>
<p>As far as the applications for electronic devices in which the main factor of
</p>
<p>interest is displaying the SoC for the user, the models based on electric circuits
</p>
<p>compete with the analytical ones, as the discriminating factor is their computational
</p>
<p>complexity.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the sole viable solution for the hybrid vehicles applications
</p>
<p>designed to reduce fuel consumption, to determine the car performance, or improve
</p>
<p>the parameters of the batteries, which are usually carried out offline and require high
</p>
<p>accuracy, are the electrochemical models [3].
</p>
<p>The recommendations listed above are general, and are only useful so far as the
</p>
<p>categorization of the model is concerned, and not for choosing the model itself.
</p>
<p>In order to determine the optimal battery model for a specific application a new
</p>
<p>method based on the analysis of the discharge profile and the use of a multi-criteria
</p>
<p>analysis (MCA) is presented. This methodology, which is the main contribution of
</p>
<p>this chapter, was developed for better BMS development and it combines energy
</p>
<p>efficiency with ease of implementation. The proposed methodology is best suited
</p>
<p>for Li-Ion batteries which present highly non-linear evolution of the SoC and other
</p>
<p>parameters.
</p>
<p>Li-ion batteries are currently the most common type for power the mobile
</p>
<p>electronic devices and electric cars. The best known structures of these batteries are:
</p>
<p>LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiNiO2, LiNiMnCoO2, LiNiCoAlO2, LiFePO4, and they
</p>
<p>combine high energy density with high power density. Their main disadvantage is
</p>
<p>related to the flat plateau area from the discharge characteristic which makes very
</p>
<p>difficult the determination of the SoC [6]. Among these batteries the LiFePO4
(LFP) ones, which use a graphite anode and a cathode made of Li ferrophosphate
</p>
<p>distinguish them self. The olivine structure of the cathode gives these batteries a
</p>
<p>high structural and thermodynamic stability, making them the safest Li-based
</p>
<p>batteries [7]. Besides the advantages of safety and the fact that their structure does
</p>
<p>not contain rare metals (Ni, Co, Mn, etc.), LFP batteries also present a set of
</p>
<p>negative aspects as compared to the rest of Li-Ion batteries. The most important of
</p>
<p>them are the low energy density, the low electrical potential (3.2&ndash;3.3 V compared
</p>
<p>to 3.6&ndash;3.7 V that is typical for Li-Ion batteries) and the strongly non-linear dis-
</p>
<p>charge characteristic.
</p>
<p>The next of the chapter is organized as follows: Sects. 19.2&ndash;19.4 describe the
</p>
<p>most known types of modeling strategies&mdash;electrochemical, analytical and circuit
</p>
<p>based followed by the proposed screening process for determining the optimal
</p>
<p>model for a specific application and a case study to validate it.

<p>19.2 Electrochemical Models
</p>
<p>The electrochemical models describe the behaviour of batteries based on the
</p>
<p>chemical processes that occur between the electrodes and the electrolyte. They use a
</p>
<p>set of differential equations to represent, in time, the processes of ion diffusion,
</p>
<p>transportation, reduction, oxidation, and distribution, and the side effects occurring
</p>
<p>in the battery. Solving these equations yields the time evolution of the battery
</p>
<p>voltage and current.
</p>
<p>The complexity of the chemical processes determines the complexity of the
</p>
<p>model, and thus the number of differential equations needed for it.
</p>
<p>There are several electrochemical models, which, starting from the lumped
</p>
<p>model which needs only two equations, evolve towards the very complex models
</p>
<p>that require up to six equations and more than 50 parameters in order to describe the
</p>
<p>behaviour of the battery.
</p>
<p>19.2.1 The Lumped Model
</p>
<p>The lumped model was one of the first models that described the processes that take
</p>
<p>place in the battery with a less complex chemical structure, such as lead-acid
</p>
<p>batteries or some Ni-MH batteries.
</p>
<p>This model is based on the Butler-Vormer equations and the Nerst theory, and
</p>
<p>considers the spatial distribution of the chemical elements between the two elec-
</p>
<p>trodes as uniform.
</p>
<p>In this model the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) generated by the electrochemical
</p>
<p>processes is given by the Nerst equation [3]:

<p>&bull; U&eth;t&THORN;&mdash;the potential of an electrode [V];
</p>
<p>&bull; U0&mdash;the electromotive force under standard conditions [V];
</p>
<p>&bull; R&mdash;the universal gas constant;
</p>
<p>&bull; T&mdash;temperature [K];
</p>
<p>&bull; F&mdash;Faraday&rsquo;s constant [C/mol];
</p>
<p>&bull; k&mdash;number of participants in the reaction;
</p>
<p>&bull; m&mdash;molarity;
</p>
<p>&bull; c&mdash;the activity coefficient;
</p>
<p>&bull; m&mdash;stoichiometric ratio
</p>
<p>576 B.-A. Enache</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To determine the current density of the battery the Butler-Vormer equation is
</p>
<p>used [2]:
</p>

<p>where:
</p>
<p>&bull; J0&mdash;density of transfer current;
</p>
<p>&bull; a&mdash;transfer coefficient;
</p>
<p>&bull; η&mdash;polarization.
</p>
<p>The advantage of this model is that it uses only two simple equations, which are
</p>
<p>easy to integrate in a simulation software. Thus, a model was developed for a
</p>
<p>Ni-MH cell, which allowed simulating its behavior in a matter of milliseconds by
</p>
<p>using the existing computers [4].
</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of the lumped model is that the equations that it uses are
</p>
<p>insufficient to describe the complex processes taking place in the modern batteries,
</p>
<p>which use advanced materials such as Li-ion, Li-Po, metal-air, etc. To model such
</p>
<p>batteries a new class of models has been developed, which have as a starting point
</p>
<p>the porous electrode theory. Among these the best known model is the
</p>
<p>Doyle-Fuller-Newman model which is presented next.
</p>
<p>19.2.2 The Doyle&ndash;Fuller&ndash;Newman Model
</p>
<p>The Doyle-Fuller-Newman model describes in detail the electrochemical processes
</p>
<p>of ion diffusion, transport and distribution that take place into a Li-ion battery. The
</p>
<p>structure of a Li-ion cell&mdash;Fig. 19.1, consists of an anode and a cathode made from
</p>
<p>a porous material, which are isolated by a separator, the whole assemblage being
</p>
<p>immersed in the electrolyte.
</p>
<p>When the battery is charged, the Li ions occupy the interstitial space within the
</p>
<p>anode. As the battery discharges, the Li ions leave the anode and enter the elec-
</p>
<p>trolyte. From there they pass through the separator and reach the cathode. This
</p>
<p>migration of ions ends when they reach the cathode and occupy an interstitial space
</p>
<p>within it. When Li ions leave the anode, an electron is released into the external
</p>
<p>circuit, generating power. When that electron reaches the cathode, it allows a Li ion
</p>
<p>to occupy a position inside it. Charging retraces the Li ions path, yet backwards,
</p>
<p>and now the cell receives power from the external circuit cell instead of delivering
</p>
<p>electricity.
</p>
<p>The Doyle-Fuller-Newman is also known as the 1D model because it considers
</p>
<p>the dynamic processes as taking place only along one axis (the horizontal axis&mdash;x).
</p>
<p>This approximation is made because the length of a cell structure along the x-axis is
</p>
<p>19 Determining the Optimal Battery Model for a Specific Application 577</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>much smaller (of the order of 100 lm) than the length of the structure for the other
</p>
<p>axes (ranging up to 100,000 lm) [3].
</p>
<p>The model uses a set of differential equations to describe the linear diffusion of
</p>
<p>Li ions in the electrolyte and the solid material of the electrodes, as well as the
</p>
<p>spatial distribution of the electrochemical processes generated as part of that pro-
</p>
<p>cess. These equations are obtained from Fick&rsquo;s diffusion law (for Li ion concen-
</p>
<p>tration), Ohm&rsquo;s law (for electric potential distribution) and the Nerst and
</p>
<p>Butler-Vormer equations [8]. The coefficients occurring in these equations are
</p>
<p>listed in Table 19.1.
</p>
<p>The 1D model is based on the diffusion of Li ions in the solid material of the
</p>
<p>electrodes. This diffusion occurs at each point of the anode and the cathode, and is
</p>
<p>modelled by the following equation, where the particles taking part in the reaction
</p>
<p>are considered to be spherical [9].

<p>On the other hand, the concentration of Li ions in the electrolyte&mdash;c2(x,t),

<p>The differential equations system (19.3)&ndash;(19.9) represents the 1D model for a
</p>
<p>cell Li-ion cell that is both in the process of discharging and in the process of
</p>
<p>recharging.
</p>
<p>The traditional methods for solving this equations system are based on the finite
</p>
<p>difference technique, which consists in dividing the x axis into equal intervals that
</p>
<p>are small enough to allow estimation of derivatives using Taylor series.
</p>
<p>Another way to process it is by linearization and solving the equations using the
</p>
<p>BAND subroutine [10]. This subroutine is coded in COBOL and solves nonlinear
</p>
<p>of equations systems with partial derivatives. The subroutine underlay the devel-
</p>
<p>opment of the DUALFOIL software, which is used for modelling and simulation of
</p>
<p>complex-structure batteries.
</p>
<p>19.2.3 DUALFOIL
</p>
<p>DUALFOIL is a free software, coded in FORTRAN, which enables modelling and
</p>
<p>simulation of such batteries as Lithium-metal, Li-ion, Na-ion and Ni-MH.
</p>
<p>To be used, the program requires an input file with the specific parameters of the
</p>
<p>battery being modelled. The user must enter in this file, in addition to the battery
</p>
<p>discharge profile, no less than 50 parameters concerning its geometrical and elec-
</p>
<p>trochemical properties. Among them are the thickness and porosity of the elec-
</p>
<p>trodes, the initial temperature, salt concentration in the electrolyte, heat dissipation
</p>
<p>capacity for the entire battery, diffusion coefficient, etc. [10].
</p>
<p>After running, the program produces four output files. The main file contains the
</p>
<p>values for the most important parameters: time, current, voltage and battery tem-
</p>
<p>perature. The remaining files contain more detailed reports about the battery
</p>
<p>operating mode; the most important being the file that describes the evolution of
</p>
<p>internal resistance.
</p>
<p>In order to be used, the DUALFOIL program requires detailed knowledge about
</p>
<p>the battery to be modelled, which is not always accessible to the average user. But
</p>
<p>once this obstacle has been overcome, the results of the modelling are of high
</p>
<p>fidelity, and are often used as benchmarks for determining the accuracy of other
</p>
<p>models.
</p>
<p>The electrochemical models are based on a linear equations system that describe
</p>
<p>the electrochemical phenomena that takes place inside the batteries. To solve this
</p>
<p>580 B.-A. Enache</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>system, a whole range of techniques of simplification and approximation are used,
</p>
<p>which do not significantly affect the accuracy of the model, but do not reduce its
</p>
<p>complexity, either. Electrochemical models generally have a high accuracy, yet
</p>
<p>they require long periods of time for simulation and detailed knowledge about the
</p>
<p>electrochemical structure of the batteries that are being modelled. For this reason
</p>
<p>they cannot be incorporated into other simulation systems that include other
</p>
<p>functional elements apart from batteries.
</p>
<p>To facilitate incorporation of the battery model within a more general simulation
</p>
<p>system electrochemical models have been abandoned for models whose accuracy is
</p>
<p>smaller, while also being less complex. These models were grouped into two
</p>
<p>classes: analytical models, and models based on electric circuits.
</p>
<p>19.3 Analytical Models
</p>
<p>Analytical models describe the behaviour of the battery at a higher level of
</p>
<p>abstraction than electrochemical models. They have been developed from experi-
</p>
<p>mental tests performed on the battery, and the obtained data were processed by
</p>
<p>curve fitting techniques. The great advantage of these models is that they manage to
</p>
<p>describe the behaviour of the battery using a small number of equations. The best
</p>
<p>known analytical models are the Shepherd model and the Peukert model which are
</p>
<p>presented next.
</p>
<p>19.3.1 The Peukert Model (Peukert&rsquo;s Law)
</p>
<p>Wilhelm Peukert studied the behaviour of lead-acid batteries subjected to constant
</p>
<p>current discharge. Following these tests, he noticed that only one equation is suf-
</p>
<p>ficient to determine the remaining battery capacity for a discharge current:
</p>
<p>C &frac14; Ik � t &eth;19:10&THORN;
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>&bull; C&mdash;battery capacity, expressed in Ah;
</p>
<p>&bull; I&mdash;discharging current;
</p>
<p>&bull; t&mdash;discharge time, in hours;
</p>
<p>&bull; k&mdash;calibration coefficient.
</p>
<p>Equation 19.10 is known as Peukert&rsquo;s law, and was developed to model the
</p>
<p>behaviour of the battery for different discharge currents.
</p>
<p>When a battery is subjected to discharge using increasingly higher constant
</p>
<p>currents, it was found that the battery internal resistance increases and the dis-
</p>
<p>charged battery capacity (up to the cutoff voltage) decreases. To compensate for
</p>
<p>19 Determining the Optimal Battery Model for a Specific Application 581</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>these losses Peukert introduced the calibration coefficient k, also known as
</p>
<p>Peukert&rsquo;s coefficient.
</p>
<p>The value of Peukert&rsquo;s coefficient is determined experimentally using two dif-
</p>
<p>ferent battery discharge curves. If we consider that the battery is discharged in time
</p>
<p>t1 for the current I1, and in t2 for the current I2, then, applying Eq. (19.10), one gets:

<p>Introducing the calibration coefficient was only a partial solution for determining
</p>
<p>the capacity discharged from the battery. It has been experimentally proven that, in
</p>
<p>a battery subjected to discharge under a high value current, even after the cutoff
</p>
<p>voltage is reached, the available capacity it is not zero [11]. This remaining capacity
</p>
<p>is caused by the decrease of the active centers number in the active substance at the
</p>
<p>cathode and the rapid increase in the resistance for the interaction between the
</p>
<p>anode and the electrolyte [12, 13].
</p>
<p>Similarly, it was demonstrated experimentally that the Peukert model can only
</p>
<p>be applied to batteries that are subjected to discharge at constant current and
</p>
<p>constant temperature. In many real situations, however, the battery discharge is
</p>
<p>done using varying currents within an extended temperature range. In such cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, the Peukert model usually approximates a smaller capacity for the
</p>
<p>battery [11].
</p>
<p>A first attempt to adapt the Peukert model, when the discharging current is
</p>
<p>variable, involves using an effective pseudo-current. Thus the discharge alternating
</p>
<p>current is discretized in several areas where its value can be considered constant;
</p>
<p>and for those areas the value of the pseudo-current (Ieff) is calculated, using the
</p>
<p>relationship:
</p>
<p>Ieff &frac14; I �
I
</p>
<p>Inom
</p>
<p>� �k�1
</p>
<p>&eth;19:12&THORN;
</p>
<p>where I is the constant discharge current, Inom is the rated discharge current supplied
</p>
<p>by the manufacturer (usually, a battery discharge time of 20 h).
</p>
<p>In this situation the total discharged capacity (Cd) from the battery is determined
</p>
<p>for each constant current range (Dt) as:
</p>
<p>Cd &frac14;
X
</p>
<p>Ieff � Dt
� �
</p>
<p>&eth;19:13&THORN;
</p>
<p>This method is generally accepted as an improvement on the Peukert model [14]
</p>
<p>for variable currents; however its accuracy is limited because it neglects the tem-
</p>
<p>perature effects over the discharge.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Another way to improve the Peukert model proposes an equation that includes
</p>
<p>the effects of both a variable current and the temperature variation. Accordingly, the
</p>
<p>capacity discharged from the battery is defined as:
</p>
<p>DCd &frac14; f I; T&eth; &THORN; &eth;19:14&THORN;
</p>
<p>Considering the least favorable case, when the discharging temperature drops
</p>
<p>and the current increases, in order to describe the behaviour of the variable dis-
</p>
<p>charge current this relationship is used:
</p>
<p>f I&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
I
</p>
<p>Inom
</p>
<p>� �a
</p>
<p>&eth;19:15&THORN;
</p>
<p>where a is a constant that depends on the type of the calibration coefficient.
</p>
<p>To describe the behaviour of the temperature within the discharge process, a
</p>
<p>function similar to that presented in (19.15) is used.
</p>
<p>f T&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
Tnom
</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>� �b
</p>
<p>&eth;19:16&THORN;
</p>
<p>where: Tnom is the rated discharge temperature, T is the temperature in the discharge
</p>
<p>process, and b is a coefficient that depends on the battery technology and the battery
</p>
<p>configuration.
</p>
<p>Considering the relations (19.15) and (19.16), an improved Peukert model is
</p>
<p>given by:
</p>
<p>DCd &frac14; c �

</p>
<p>� �b
</p>
<p>&eth;19:17&THORN;
</p>
<p>where c is a coefficient that compensates the combined effect of a and b coefficients.
</p>
<p>This model has been verified experimentally, and it was shown to have an error
</p>
<p>of less than 5% for an extended range of temperature and discharge currents [14].
</p>
<p>The Peukert model is one of the simplest and most enduring models developed
</p>
<p>to simulate battery behaviour. Although it has undergone some changes over time,
</p>
<p>it remains a model with a limited degree of accuracy, which is used, in particular, to
</p>
<p>deal with batteries with a simple structure. For batteries that involve more complex
</p>
<p>phenomena in the process of discharge, the Peukert model is not sufficient. For such
</p>
<p>batteries a different model that combines ease of use with high accuracy, namely the
</p>
<p>Shepherd model is used.

<p>19.3.2 The Shepherd Model
</p>
<p>The Shepherd model was developed to optimize the capacity/weight ratio of the
</p>
<p>batteries used by the US Navy. To achieve this objective it was considered nec-
</p>
<p>essary to develop a model that could express the dependence of the output voltage
</p>
<p>of the battery for a specific the discharge [15].
</p>
<p>Developing the model was done according to the following hypotheses:
</p>
<p>&bull; The anode and cathode have porous active materials;
</p>
<p>&bull; The electrolyte and the electrodes are homogeneous;
</p>
<p>&bull; The electrodes are parallel;
</p>
<p>&bull; The current density is evenly distributed between the two electrodes;
</p>
<p>&bull; The distance between the electrodes is small compared with their dimensions
</p>
<p>(width, length);
</p>
<p>&bull; The temperature is constant;
</p>
<p>&bull; Internal resistance is constant;
</p>
<p>&bull; The battery is discharged at a constant current.
</p>
<p>After formulating the hypotheses, the development of the model passed on
</p>
<p>obtaining the discharge curves for different types of batteries: Ni-Cd,
</p>
<p>silver-zinc-alkaline; Air-zinc-alkaline, lead-acid, etc. On this basis Shepherd noted
</p>
<p>that any discharge feature presents three distinct areas which are presented in
</p>
<p>Fig. 19.2 and are:
</p>
<p>&bull; The initial area;
</p>
<p>&bull; The zone determined by the polarization effects;
</p>
<p>&bull; The zone determined by internal resistance;
</p>

</p>
<p>zones for a LiFePO4 battery

<p>584 B.-A. Enache</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>After establishing the discharge zones, Shepherd approximated their evolution
</p>
<p>by a series of curves with known equations. As a result of this process, it was
</p>
<p>determined that the equation that best models the discharge behavior of the battery
</p>
<p>is:
</p>
<p>Vbatt &frac14; E0 � K � Q= Q�
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>idt
</p>
<p>� �� 	
</p>
<p>� i� R0 � i &eth;19:18&THORN;
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>&bull; Vbatt&mdash;output voltage of the battery (V);
</p>
<p>&bull; E0&mdash;open circuit voltage (V);
</p>
<p>&bull; K&mdash;polarization coefficient (Ω);
</p>
<p>&bull; Q&mdash;battery capacity (Ah);
</p>
<p>&bull; i&mdash;discharge current (A)
</p>
<p>&bull; R0&mdash;battery internal resistance (Ω).
</p>
<p>This relationship is known as the Shepherd model. It presents a nonlinear term
</p>
<p>K � Q= Q�
R
</p>
<p>idt
� �
 �
</p>
<p>that models the terminal voltage variation in accordance with
</p>
<p>the magnitude of the discharge current. This behaviour is specific to real batteries,
</p>
<p>but this term generates an infinite loop and instability in simulation [16].
</p>
<p>For the Shepherd model to be usable in simulations software, the algebraic loop
</p>
<p>must be removed. The models obtained in this way are known as simplified
</p>
<p>Shepherd models, and the most representative such model is described by the
</p>
<p>relation [17]:
</p>
<p>Vbatt &frac14; E0 � K � Q= Q� i � t&eth; &THORN;&frac12; � &thorn;A � exp �B � it&eth; &THORN; &eth;19:19&THORN;
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>&bull; A&mdash;the amplitude at the end of zone 1 (V);
</p>
<p>&bull; B&mdash;the inverse value of the capacity discharged at the end of zone 2 (Ah&minus;1).
</p>
<p>The Shepherd model has the great advantage of incorporating, into a single
</p>
<p>equation, the dependence of output voltage for a discharge current. This makes it
</p>
<p>easy to use in a complex simulation system that also includes other operation
</p>
<p>equations for the components involved.
</p>
<p>As regards the simulation systems that use electrical and electronic components,
</p>
<p>the Shepherd model, and by extension analytical models, cannot be used, so a new
</p>
<p>category of models was developed specifically for these systems, i.e. models based
</p>
<p>on electric circuits which are presented next.

<p>19.4 Models Based on Electric Circuits
</p>
<p>The models based on circuits describe the electrochemical phenomena that occur as
</p>
<p>part of the batteries, using only electrical and electronic components. They typically
</p>
<p>use voltage sources, resistors and capacitors to model the variation of the output
</p>
<p>voltage for a specific discharge current and SoC.
</p>
<p>The complexity of the system is given, in general, by the number of components
</p>
<p>used in the model. The simplest systems use only a voltage source and a resistor,
</p>
<p>and the most complex ones use in addition one or more parallel resistor&mdash;capacitor
</p>
<p>branches.
</p>
<p>19.4.1 The Elementary (Rint) Model
</p>
<p>The simplest circuit model used to describe the behaviour of a battery consists of a
</p>
<p>voltage source whose value is equal to the OCV of the battery (E0) and a resistance
</p>
<p>whose value is equal to the internal resistance of the battery (R0)&mdash;Fig. 19.3.
</p>
<p>If a load is connected to the terminals of that circuit, it will produce a current in
</p>
<p>the circuit which, according to Kirchhoff&rsquo;s second theorem, will have the
</p>
<p>expression:
</p>
<p>I &frac14;
E0 � Vbatt
R0 &thorn;RL
</p>
<p>&eth;19:20&THORN;
</p>
<p>where Vbatt is the output voltage, and RL is the load resistance.
</p>
<p>The emergence of the discharge current will lead to a lower battery capacity, and
</p>
<p>consequently to a output voltage drop. To model this behaviour it is necessary that
</p>
<p>both the value of the supply voltage and the value of the internal resistance should
</p>
<p>change in concordance with the battery SoC. This being the case, the easiest
</p>
<p>method for determining the remaining battery capacity consists in integrating the
</p>

<p>discharge current over time. Thus, by integrating Eq. (19.20) one gets the variation
</p>
<p>of the SoC for a specific discharge current:
</p>
<p>SOC t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; SOC t0&eth; &THORN; �

<p>t0
</p>
<p>I t&eth; &THORN;dt &eth;19:21&THORN;
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>&bull; SOC(t)&mdash;the battery charge status at a given time t;
</p>
<p>&bull; SOC(t0)&mdash;the battery charge status at the beginning of the discharge;
</p>
<p>&bull; QNOM&mdash;rated capacity of the battery;
</p>
<p>&bull; I&mdash;discharge current.
</p>
<p>In those specific cases where the battery charge state is very well determined, the
</p>
<p>discharge current has very low variance, and the discharge time is also short, the
</p>
<p>elementary model is sufficient to accurately model the behaviour of the battery.
</p>
<p>The elementary model considers the battery to be an ideal voltage source whose
</p>
<p>value depends only on the discharge current and SoC, but it fails to consider more
</p>
<p>complex phenomena such as polarization or hysteresis, and therefore in the more
</p>
<p>complex simulations its accuracy is limited.
</p>
<p>A way for increasing the elementary model&rsquo;s accuracy in incorporating a number
</p>
<p>of nonlinear elements to reproduce the more complex phenomena occurring in the
</p>
<p>battery. One of these models is the Th&eacute;venin model.
</p>
<p>19.4.2 The Th&eacute;venin Model
</p>
<p>It is a circuit-based model, which extends the elementary model by adding a parallel
</p>
<p>group consisting of a resistor and a capacitor (an RC branch)&mdash;Fig. 19.4.
</p>

</p>
<p>model
</p>
<p>19 Determining the Optimal Battery Model for a Specific Application 587</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Applying Kirchhoff&rsquo;s second theorem for the Th&eacute;venin, one gets:
</p>
<p>Vbatt &frac14; E0 � R0 � I � Rp � Ip &eth;19:22&THORN;
</p>
<p>where Rp is the polarization resistance and Ip is the polarization current.
</p>
<p>The polarization current is obtained by applying Kirchhoff&rsquo;s first theorem to the
</p>
<p>circuit node and taking into account the expression of the current on the polarization
</p>
<p>capacitor Cp side:
</p>
<p>dIp
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14;
</p>
<p>&eth;I � Ip&THORN;
</p>
<p>s
&eth;19:23&THORN;
</p>
<p>where s = RpCp is the time constant of the circuit.
</p>
<p>A discrete solution of the Eq. (19.23) is [18]:
</p>
<p>Ip;i &frac14; 1�
1� exp �Dt=s&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>�Dt=s

</p>
<p>� Ii�1 &thorn; exp �Dt=s&eth; &THORN; � Ip;i�1
</p>
<p>&eth;19:24&THORN;
</p>
<p>Keeping the same discretization pace and applying the solution provided by
</p>
<p>Eq. (19.24) in the Eq. (19.22), the equation for the Th&eacute;venin model is obtained in a
</p>
<p>discrete form:
</p>
<p>Vbatt;i &frac14; E0 � R0 � Ii � Rp � Ip;i &eth;19:25&THORN;
</p>
<p>This Eq. (19.25) is the basis for determining the values of the components used
</p>
<p>in the model. The main techniques for extracting the parameters of the model are
</p>
<p>based on the analysis of a discharge pulse or approximation and errors minimizing
</p>
<p>strategies.
</p>
<p>The Th&eacute;venin model is able, by adding the RC branch, to model both polar-
</p>
<p>ization effects and the effects of the loss of capacity due to the high current dis-
</p>
<p>charge [3]. From this point of view it manages to describe some of the complex
</p>
<p>processes that occur within the battery without appealing to complicated differential
</p>
<p>equations.
</p>
<p>The Th&eacute;venin model combines the electrochemical effects occurring into the
</p>
<p>batteries with the ease of use and easy integration into simulation systems, which
</p>
<p>makes it a model often used both by battery manufacturers and developers of
</p>
<p>systems for the automotive industry.

<p>19.4.3 The R-C Network Model
</p>
<p>It is a model that extends the Th&eacute;venin model by adding several parallel resistance&ndash;
</p>
<p>capacitor branches&mdash;Fig. 19.5. The number of RC branches models the transitory
</p>
<p>behaviour of the battery through a truncated exponential series. They determine, in
</p>
<p>fact, the resolution of the system response for various input signals.
</p>
<p>For a real battery there are no exponential series that can entirely model its
</p>
<p>behaviour, therefore the number of RC branches must be chosen in such a way as to
</p>
<p>best approximate the behaviour of the battery for a particular discharge profile [18].
</p>
<p>By applying Kirchhoff&rsquo;s first theorem to each node of the RC networks and

<p>19.5 Determining the Optimal Battery Model
</p>
<p>for a Specific Application
</p>
<p>Determining the optimal battery model for a specific application is actually a
</p>
<p>problem of establishing a compromise between accurately approximating the
</p>
<p>experimental data and the complexity of the model. In general, the complexity of
</p>
<p>the model is limited by the computational resources and the correlation of the
</p>
<p>phenomena occurring inside the battery with the number of elements that are part of
</p>
<p>it [19].
</p>
<p>Another indispensable factor that needs to be taken into account when deter-
</p>
<p>mining the optimal model is the nature of the discharge profile. As a result of
</p>
<p>experimental measurements carried out in [20] it is shown that in discharge profiles
</p>
<p>involving rapid current changes, the response of the system is determined by the
</p>
<p>component with the lowest time constant.
</p>
<p>In general the most common discharge profiles is the constant current discharge
</p>
<p>[21, 22] or slow variation pulses [23]. For this case, the determination of the
</p>
<p>optimal model is done by analyzing the response of the system to a discharge
</p>
<p>impulse at 10% of the SoC [21]. This method of analysis cannot be applied in the
</p>
<p>case of complex profiles that include rapid variations of the discharge current.
</p>
<p>Taking into account all of the above, next is presented a novel method for
</p>
<p>determining the optimal battery model for a specific application. This method
</p>
<p>comprises of two phases: a discharge profile analysis and a data processing stage for
</p>
<p>choosing the model that combines best approximation of the experimental data with
</p>
<p>the minimum of resources used.
</p>
<p>In the first stage from the discharge profile are extracted the areas that have rapid
</p>
<p>variations of the discharge current and the areas where the discharge current is
</p>
<p>constant, namely plateau areas. Since a single model should best approximate both
</p>
<p>areas, the less favorable ones are extracted. These areas are the area where the
</p>
<p>variation of the discharge current occurs within the shortest period of time, and the
</p>
<p>area where the plateau discharge has the longest period. For those areas the
</p>
<p>response speed of the models undergoing analysis will be determined.
</p>
<p>In the second stage the experimental data previously obtained are processed by a
</p>
<p>MCA and the optimal model is determined.
</p>
<p>MCA is a tool for comparison and ranking of the different results, even when
</p>
<p>using multiple evaluation criteria [24]. It operates with several concepts, of which
</p>
<p>the most important are: the option, the criteria, the performance matrix, the score
</p>
<p>and weight.
</p>
<p>The options are items that are subject to comparison or hierarchy. Of these, after
</p>
<p>applying the MCA, the best solution (option) is chosen according to certain criteria.
</p>
<p>A criteria is the measure according to which the options are assessed. Each
</p>
<p>criteria measures a relevant aspect of the option, and should not depend on any
</p>
<p>other criteria.
</p>
<p>Systematization of data, as part of the MCA, is done by using the performance
</p>
<p>matrix. Each row of the matrix represents option, and each column includes an
</p>
<p>590 B.-A. Enache</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>evaluation criteria. The values that are recorded in each cell represent the perfor-
</p>
<p>mance level of an option for a particular evaluation criteria.
</p>
<p>The score (the number of points) represents the value of the consequences
</p>
<p>generated by each option. They are usually standardized for a scale between 0 and
</p>
<p>100, where the best option gets 100, and the remaining options get values pro-
</p>
<p>portional to their performance.
</p>
<p>The weights represent a percentage values assigned to each criteria in order to
</p>
<p>highlight its importance. The sum of the weights must add up to 100%.
</p>
<p>In the next section a case study which involve determining the optimal model for
</p>
<p>a LFP battery subjected to discharge after the Urban Dynamometer Driving
</p>
<p>Schedule (UDDS) cycle is presented. This study has the main goal of establishing
</p>
<p>the best suited model to be incorporated into a BMS for a LFP battery. The model
</p>
<p>has to combine ease of implementation with energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>The characteristics of the LFP cell used are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Rated voltage: 3.3 V
</p>
<p>&bull; Rated discharge current: 0.7 A
</p>
<p>&bull; Rated capacity: 1400 mAh for the rated discharge current
</p>
<p>&bull; Cut off voltage: 2.5 V
</p>
<p>&bull; Maximum allowable discharge current: 2.1 A.
</p>
<p>The UDDS discharge cycle&mdash;Fig. 19.6, was chosen because of its high com-
</p>
<p>plexity [25] and also because it is part of the basic tests aimed to determine the
</p>
<p>characteristics of the batteries that equip electric and hybrid cars in Europe and
</p>
<p>America, alongside other test such as: European Driving Cycle, Extra Urban
</p>
<p>Driving Cycle, Highway Fuel Economy Test, New York City Cycle, Urban
</p>
<p>Dynamometer Driving Schedule.
</p>
<p>To determine the optimal model for the LFP cell subjected to discharge after the
</p>
<p>UDDS cycle only those models which include the variation of the output voltage
</p>
<p>with the discharge current, and which can be incorporated in a BMS will be

<p>analyzed. Therefore, the following models were chosen: Shepherd, Th&eacute;venin,
</p>
<p>second, third and fourth RC network.
</p>
<p>Determining the parameters used in these models was based on experimental
</p>
<p>tests carried out in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the USABC [26],
</p>
<p>and PNGV [27, 28], manuals. The determined parameters are presented in
</p>
<p>Tables 19.2 and 19.3.
</p>
<p>In accordance with the method proposed, in the first stage the UDDS discharge
</p>
<p>cycle is analyzed, and the most representative areas of rapid change and plateau are
</p>
<p>extracted&mdash;Fig. 19.7a. These areas are number from P1 to P5 for the plateau areas
</p>
<p>and from R1 to R6 for the rapid change ones, after this they are organized according
</p>
<p>to their duration. The longest plateau and the shortest rapid change areas are chosen
</p>
<p>which, in this case, are P3 and R2. From these areas a new discharge profile is
</p>
<p>constructed&mdash;Fig. 19.7b.
</p>
<p>This profile is applied to the selected models and their response speed for the two
</p>
<p>areas is calculated&mdash;Fig. 19.8.
</p>
<p>The second stage of the proposed methodology is dedicated to data analysis.
</p>
<p>Now the MCA for the five models is constructed as follows:
</p>
<p>Options: The Shepherd model, the Th&eacute;venin model, the RC network model of
</p>
<p>order II, III and IV;
</p>
<p>Criteria: The response speed of the models for the new discharge profile (for both
</p>
<p>areas P3 and R2) and the number of parameters needed for the modelling (to reduce
</p>
<p>the complexity of the models).

<p>Weights: Response rates for both areas get a 45% weight, and the number of
</p>
<p>model parameters a 10% weight [29].
</p>
<p>The values of each option for the following three criteria are (Tables 19.4 and
</p>
<p>19.5):
</p>
<p>Through the standardization of these values and applying the weights, the per-
</p>
<p>formance matrix of the MCA is obtained.
</p>
<p>Analyzing the scores in the performance matrix, it can be noticed that the four
</p>
<p>models based on electric circuits are very similar in terms of performance, while the
</p>
<p>Shepherd model does not perform so well for this discharge profile.
</p>
<p>Even though the fourth order RC network has the highest score regarding per-
</p>
<p>formance, it fails to compensate the large number of parameters used, so ends up on
</p>
<p>the third place with a total score of 94 points. Even if the score difference between
</p>
<p>the first two models is very small, the third order RC network model, which
</p>
<p>obtained the best score, i.e. 94.01, is the optimal model for a LFP cell subjected to
</p>
<p>discharge after the UDDS cycle, as it manages to achieve the best compromise
</p>
<p>between approximating the experimental data and the number of parameters
</p>
<p>required for modelling.
</p>
<p>In order to validate the proposed method, we compared the data obtained from
</p>
<p>the five models subjected to discharge after the UDDS cycle to the data obtained
</p>
<p>from a LFP cell subjected to discharge after the same test&mdash;Fig. 19.9.
</p>
<p>Once all data has been processed, the mean and maximum relative errors gen-
</p>
<p>erated by the five models were counted. The most significant errors were reported

<p>order RC network model produces the smallest errors 0.53 and 1.30% respectively,
</p>
<p>but its large number of parameters and the close performance of the other two
</p>
<p>models makes him the third choice. The third and second order RC network models
</p>
<p>have almost the same mean error of 0.55%, but the difference in the maximum error
</p>
<p>i.e. 1.34% for the third order RC network and 1.37% for the second order RC
</p>
<p>network makes the third order RC network model the best choice for this appli-
</p>
<p>cation. The results obtained from the real data comparison are very similar with the
</p>
<p>ones from the proposed methodology and so the method is validated.
</p>
<p>19.6 Conclusions
</p>
<p>Battery modelling is a complex area where there is still no universally valid con-
</p>
<p>stant. Choosing the right model is be based on several parameters, out of which the
</p>
<p>most important ones are: the range of application, the accuracy and the model
</p>
<p>complexity.
</p>
<p>The main modeling techniques are involve electrochemical phenomena, elec-
</p>
<p>trical and electronic circuits or analytic approximation techniques.
</p>
<p>The electrochemical models are based on a linear system of equations that
</p>
<p>describe the electrochemical phenomena that occur within the batteries. Solving this
</p>
<p>system require a range of techniques for approximation and reduction, which do not
</p>
<p>significantly affect the accuracy of the model, but do not significantly reduce its
</p>
<p>complexity either.
</p>
<p>In general, the electrochemical models have high accuracy, but require large
</p>
<p>simulation periods of time and detailed knowledge about the electrochemical
</p>
<p>structures of the batteries being modelled.
</p>
<p>The analytical models describe the behaviour of the battery at a higher
</p>
<p>abstraction level than do the electrochemical models. They have been developed
</p>
<p>from experimental tests performed on the batteries, on which curve fitting tech-
</p>
<p>niques were applied. The great advantage of these models is that they manage to
</p>
<p>describe the behaviour of the battery using a small number of equations. The
</p>
<p>accuracy of these models is smaller than that of the electrochemical models, but
</p>
<p>they are more suitable for incorporation into the simulation systems and other
</p>
<p>systems.
</p>
<p>The models based on electrical circuits do not represent the internal structure of
</p>
<p>the battery, but they rather replicate its behavior by using different electrical
</p>
<p>components. They typically use voltage sources, resistors and capacitors to model
</p>
<p>the variation of the output voltage for a specific discharge profile and SoC. They
</p>
<p>have a lower degree of accuracy, but are the easiest to integrate into the simulation
</p>
<p>systems and BMSs, which makes them attractive both for battery manufacturers and
</p>
<p>developers of systems for the automotive industry.
</p>
<p>For applications that involve rapid discharge current variations, and also periods
</p>
<p>of stability, such as the UDDS discharge profile, after the research conducted it was
</p>
<p>determined that the optimal model for an LFP cell is the third order RC network

<p>Abstract The energy management problem is essential in optimal planning and
</p>
<p>operation of water distribution systems. This problem involves establishing the
</p>
<p>operation schedule for all water hydrophore stations from the system. One of the
</p>
<p>available policies for improving energy efficiency is related to the decrease of
</p>
<p>electricity consumption. This supposes two important aspects: the upgrading of the
</p>
<p>water distribution system and use of software packages order to ease the decision
</p>
<p>making process. Two approaches based on clustering and decision trees are pro-
</p>
<p>posed for electrical energy consumption forecasting in the water distribution sys-
</p>
<p>tems. The comparative studies were realized using a database of 85 urban water
</p>
<p>hydrophore stations belonging to a Romanian water distribution company. Based
</p>
<p>on these results, it can be considered that the new proposed approaches have the
</p>
<p>ability to constitute an IT infrastructure which can be actively used for improving
</p>
<p>energy efficiency in water distribution systems.

<p>20.1 Energy Efficiency of Water Distribution Systems
</p>
<p>The linkage between two important components of our life, namely water and
</p>
<p>energy, sometimes called the water-energy nexus, is increasingly tighter due to
</p>
<p>massive demand for both water and energy. Water is used in electrical energy
</p>
<p>production and electrical energy is necessary to extract, treat and distribute water
</p>
<p>and to clean the waste water.
</p>
<p>These aspects explain the water-energy nexus, such that both components must
</p>
<p>be addressed together in an efficiency energy policy [1]. Even if there is a rela-
</p>
<p>tionship between the two components, these have been considered and managed
</p>
<p>independently until recently.
</p>
<p>In planning or operating water supply systems, traditionally the electrical energy
</p>
<p>consumptions were mostly neglected or given little importance [2, 3]. The inter-
</p>
<p>dependency between these two important components is shown in Fig. 20.1 [4].
</p>
<p>These interdependencies must be considered, because the constraints of one
</p>
<p>resource introduce constraints in the other. For example, the droughts and heat
</p>
<p>waves can lead to water constraints that, subsequently, can become constraints in
</p>
<p>the hydropower sector. In the same way, the outages from power systems can
</p>
<p>represent constraints in the water and wastewater sectors [3, 5].
</p>
<p>High energy amounts are needed for pumping water, treating the water to
</p>
<p>drinking quality, distribution of water, pumping and treating wastewater. Thus,
</p>
<p>obtaining potable water and cleaning wastewater using less electrical energy
</p>
<p>amount should represent an important target for water companies. For example,
</p>
<p>there are countries where energy used for water treatment is of about 3% of the
</p>
<p>nation&rsquo;s electricity use (in USA and UK). In some European countries, Sweden for
</p>
<p>example, the energy amount is approximately 1%. However, there are countries

<p>with a big percent, around 10% (for example Israel) [1, 6]. From the entire chain,
</p>
<p>water pumping requires the highest energy amount.
</p>
<p>In this moment, some countries have already launched nation-wide energy
</p>
<p>efficiency programs in water supply systems. For example, in the USA, in
</p>
<p>California region, energy efficiency must increase by 20% according to the
</p>
<p>California Water Plan. A similar percentage was approved in China and Sweden,
</p>
<p>where the wastewater treatment energy saving target is set for at least 20&ndash;30% from
</p>
<p>the total electrical energy requirement [1].
</p>
<p>In the context of energy efficiency, the Watergy concept appeared. The term
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watergy&rdquo; was coined by the Alliance to Save Energy in order to describe the
</p>
<p>strong link between water and energy in urban water distribution systems [7, 8].
</p>
<p>In a statement given in the Alliance to Save Energy report [8] it is stated that
</p>
<p>between 2 and 3% of the total world electricity consumption is used for the
</p>
<p>pumping and treatment of water used by residential and industrial consumers.
</p>
<p>For the water supply companies, these costs with consumed energy are the
</p>
<p>largest expenditure. These costs can reach up to 65% of the annual operating budget
</p>
<p>of a water supply company [9]. Also, water losses can augment the total cost. These
</p>
<p>losses may reach high levels in cities from countries where investments in water
</p>
<p>supply systems are very small. The examples can include countries from Latin
</p>
<p>America (Mexico, Brazil) or India where the losses are in the range of 40&ndash;50% [8].
</p>
<p>The major steps involved in cities with clean water supply are presented in
</p>
<p>Fig. 20.2 [10]. It can be observed that in each step the electrical energy con-
</p>
<p>sumption is significant.
</p>
<p>The electrical energy consumption from water supply systems is influenced by
</p>
<p>factors such as: topographical factors, geographical factors (water sources and
</p>
<p>consumers location), technical factors (pipe dimensions and configurations, rated
</p>
<p>powers of the pumps), treatment standards, and consumption factors (consumers&rsquo;
</p>
<p>number, consumers&rsquo; types, and consumption category). This varies from city to
</p>
<p>city, depending on the factors described above [7&ndash;9, 11&ndash;15].
</p>
<p>Other factors that can also significantly affect electrical energy consumption
</p>
<p>depend on operational strategies and technology choices at national level [14].
</p>
<p>An analysis of Fig. 20.2 can lead to the discovery of the technical factors that
</p>
<p>lead to a high electrical energy consumption: pump stations poor design, installa-
</p>
<p>tion or maintenance, old pipes with high head loss, bottlenecks in the supply
</p>
<p>networks, excessive supply pressure, or inefficient operation strategies of various
</p>
<p>supply facilities [9, 11, 16&ndash;23].
</p>
<p>There are many solutions for energy-saving in water supply systems, which do
</p>
<p>not require huge investment: from decreasing the volume of water pumps (e.g.,
</p>
<p>adjusting pressure zone boundaries) to reducing the price of energy (e.g., avoiding
</p>
<p>peak hour pumping and making effective use of storage tanks) or increasing pump
</p>
<p>efficiency (e.g., ensuring that pumps are operating near their best efficiency point).
</p>
<p>These solutions can recover their costs in a time period ranging from a few months
</p>
<p>to 3 years [19&ndash;24].
</p>
<p>In addition to these technical solutions, the companies can implement modern
</p>
<p>solutions based on the supervisory, control, and acquisition data systems. These
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>solutions use integrated information systems, able to realize complex monitoring
</p>
<p>and automation functions, implemented through customized software packages.
</p>
<p>Also, the SCADA systems can provide an efficient energy consumption manage-
</p>
<p>ment and can improve all activities from water supply systems. The motivation for
</p>
<p>introducing such systems is due the following factors [9, 17&ndash;23].
</p>
<p>&bull; the structure of the water supply systems became increasingly complex due to
</p>
<p>rising demands and the diversity of water sources;
</p>
<p>&bull; an aging infrastructure that leads to high operating costs;
</p>
<p>&bull; the availability and reliability of capable hardware components and software
</p>
<p>packages.

<p>The energy efficiency policies in water supply systems must take account both of
</p>
<p>technical aspects which lead to infrastructure upgrades and information aspects that
</p>
<p>enable the supervisory and control of all activities through SCADA systems.
</p>
<p>Energy efficiency policies correlated with of electricity prices growth have
</p>
<p>stimulated water supply companies, to find solutions to minimize their electrical
</p>
<p>energy consumption. An electrical energy consumption forecast with small errors
</p>
<p>can guarantee an efficient management plan leading to water supply of the cus-
</p>
<p>tomers at all times with minimum energy cost, considering the various technical
</p>
<p>constraints (reservoir levels, water pressure in the distribution system, water quality,
</p>
<p>and supply restrictions). Because in electricity markets, the price of electricity can
</p>
<p>change hourly, the water supply companies could move a part from the daily
</p>
<p>electrical energy consumption from a certain hour to other hours when the price is
</p>
<p>lower. But to achieve this target the water companies must have accurate electricity
</p>
<p>consumption forecasts. If the errors are high, they can lead to purchasing a sup-
</p>
<p>plementary energy amount with a high price from the day-ahead market or the
</p>
<p>intra-day market.
</p>
<p>For electrical energy consumption forecasting, many methods were proposed in
</p>
<p>the literature. These methods are based mainly on classical approaches: heuristic,
</p>
<p>linear regression, or similar day. From these, the heuristic approach leads to the
</p>
<p>smallest errors (between 2.5 and 3%). In order to apply this type of method, a
</p>
<p>significant input database is required, with measurements: weather forecast, day
</p>
<p>type (working or weekend), knowledge of future events, and other historical
</p>
<p>operational data.
</p>
<p>Out of these methods, few are taking into account the technical characteristics of
</p>
<p>the water hydrophore stations and the uncertainties that may exist in the system due
</p>
<p>to lack of measurements. The higher uncertainty degree leads to lower quality
</p>
<p>decisions made by the human operator. Therefore, the attempts to reduce uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty must be well substantiated. However, even with the reduction of the infor-
</p>
<p>mation uncertainty, considerable efforts and expenses are necessary. Thus, the
</p>
<p>targets of the forecasting process are to determine those parameters and charac-
</p>
<p>teristics which influence most the results and to improve the quality of the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding models and the relevant information.
</p>
<p>In order to consider all these factors, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques
</p>
<p>based on decision trees and clustering techniques are proposed for the electrical
</p>
<p>energy consumption forecasting in water distribution systems. These approaches
</p>
<p>are original because, to the author&rsquo;s best knowledge, no other methods proposed
</p>
<p>previously in the literature use decision trees or clustering for electricity con-
</p>
<p>sumption forecasting in water distribution systems. A comparative study using a
</p>
<p>database that contains records from 85 urban hydrophore stations belonging to a
</p>
<p>water distribution company from Romania will be presented. Using these approa-
</p>
<p>ches, the forecasting errors of the electrical energy consumption are better (ap-
</p>
<p>proximately 1%) than the ones currently expected by water companies
</p>
<p>(approximately 3%). Thus, the results obtained demonstrate the ability of the
</p>
<p>proposed approaches to become an important step in ensuring an efficient man-
</p>
<p>agement in the water distribution systems.

<p>The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 20.2 presents a
</p>
<p>short review of AI techniques. Section 20.3 presents the implementation details of

<p>the proposed methods and the results of their testing on a real water distribution

</p>
<p>20.2 AI Techniques in Electrical Energy Consumption
</p>
<p>Forecasting
</p>
<p>20.2.1 General Aspects
</p>
<p>Today, information technology has drastically changed education, the nature of
</p>
<p>work, society, and decision-making processes all over, among other things. More
</p>
<p>information is becoming available, faster than ever before. The changing face of
</p>
<p>information technology and communication are proof that the economy, and in
</p>
<p>particular the utilities systems sector (power, water, gas, etc.), have entered a new
</p>
<p>era of fundamental change. The impact is being felt in the market, in the control and
</p>
<p>operation of the power, water or gas networks. Under these circumstances of
</p>
<p>momentous change, AI has the potential to play a more important role [25&ndash;27].
</p>
<p>The main AI applications developed worldwide in the last years are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Load/energy forecasting,
</p>
<p>&bull; Optimal flow,
</p>
<p>&bull; Operating and expansion planning,
</p>
<p>&bull; Tariff selection,
</p>
<p>&bull; Alarm processing and fault diagnosis,
</p>
<p>&bull; Consumption control (power, water, gas, etc.).
</p>
<p>The most used AI techniques are: Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, or
</p>
<p>Evolutionary programming. Other techniques based on machine learning are also
</p>
<p>used for classification and prediction. From these, the Decision Trees and
</p>
<p>Clustering algorithms are considered the most popular approaches. In the following,
</p>
<p>a summary of some theoretical issues relates to the AI techniques are presented.
</p>
<p>20.2.2 Artificial Neural Networks
</p>
<p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used increasingly in modelling and con-
</p>
<p>trolling industrial processes, gaining momentum in recent years in front of the
</p>
<p>conventional methods. Also called connectionist networks, ANNs reproduce certain
</p>
<p>functions of the human brain by simulating a model of the brain which is as yet
</p>
<p>extremely simplified. Because they are able to generalize linear statistic methods,
</p>
<p>ANNs are extremely well adapted for solving shape recognition problems, for
</p>
<p>604 G. Grigoras</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>which they give excellent results. Much of this interest has come about with the
</p>
<p>successful of real-word applications of ANNs and their ability to learn [26].
</p>
<p>ANNs, as universal approximators, can give a systematic approach to the
</p>
<p>modelling of industrial processes, especially in those complex processes where
</p>
<p>solving the operation equations is very difficult using conventional mathematical
</p>
<p>methods. The most widely used ANN is the Multilayer Perceptron with the asso-
</p>
<p>ciated back propagation error learning, for minimizing the observed sum of squared
</p>
<p>errors over a given set of data.
</p>
<p>In the literature excellent results were obtained using RNAs in some technical
</p>
<p>areas, but there have been also some problems that could not be successfully
</p>
<p>resolved using these techniques. From a recent analysis of applications in electric
</p>
<p>systems the main conclusions are:
</p>
<p>&bull; ANNs are extremely well developed to forecasting short-term consumption,
</p>
<p>especially if their architecture is optimized (for example, by using genetic
</p>
<p>algorithms);
</p>
<p>&bull; encouraging results have been obtained in modelling and controlling production
</p>
<p>units, alarm processing, and distribution networks control;
</p>
<p>&bull; ANNs are not the best choice for problems concerning network safety, pro-
</p>
<p>duction plan research and electrical networks planning.
</p>
<p>The success in industrial process modelling can be firstly represented by the
</p>
<p>ability to extract information about the model structure and the relationships
</p>
<p>between its input and output data from trained network. Thus, these can become
</p>
<p>very important in validation of the models and the optimization and control of
</p>
<p>process. Furthermore, when the model of the process is not known, the objective is
</p>
<p>to learn as much about the system, and the obtained information to be used in the
</p>
<p>analysis of the process and in determining the disturbing factors that affect it.
</p>
<p>20.2.3 Fuzzy Techniques
</p>
<p>The fuzzy techniques (FT) were presented for the first time in the mid of the 60s by
</p>
<p>L. A. Zadeh. They had a huge success and have been used immediately in various
</p>
<p>fields. The broad development of mathematical theory, especially in areas of
</p>
<p>Possibility Theory, Fuzzy Control, ANN, and Pattern Recognition provided the
</p>
<p>basis for resolving different problems. Today, these techniques are implemented in
</p>
<p>many software packages and hardware components [25&ndash;28].
</p>
<p>The advantage of these techniques is represented by the ability to work and
</p>
<p>perform calculations with uncertainties. These uncertainties can result from human
</p>
<p>observations based on descriptions and abstract information obtained by modelling
</p>
<p>the process. A classification of the uncertainty sources and the mathematical models
</p>
<p>corresponding to these is shown in Fig. 20.3.
</p>
<p>20 Electrical Energy Consumption Forecasting &hellip; 605</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If for the first two sources of imprecision (inaccurate measurements, random
</p>
<p>events) appropriate mathematical models have been determined, it&rsquo;s not the same
</p>
<p>for the last source of imprecision (description language), although we use everyday
</p>
<p>expressions such as &ldquo;the energy consumption is small/big&rdquo; etc. Most linguistic
</p>
<p>descriptions such as Small, Medium, and High are fuzzy in nature. These vague
</p>
<p>descriptions are part of modelling process and the algorithm.
</p>
<p>The decision maker must make the difference between the various linguistic
</p>
<p>classes, e.g., when these classify the operation regimes of the supervised system
</p>
<p>according to certain operational characteristics [25&ndash;28]. The linguistic description is
</p>
<p>a part of the modelling process and the operators/experts&rsquo; language. The experts&rsquo;
</p>
<p>knowledge is usually translated in natural language. Therefore, it requires a way of
</p>
<p>encoding and manipulating knowledge expressed in natural language. This
</p>
<p>approach could be based on the use of linguistic variables and nuanced sets.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the experts&rsquo; knowledge is affected by the ambiguity and imprecision of
</p>
<p>the natural language. The fuzzy techniques try to resolve these problems through a
</p>
<p>coherent modelling of the uncertainty, while providing the possibility to operate
</p>
<p>with such models.
</p>
<p>The fuzzy sets are conceptually linked to the uncertain intrinsic properties of the
</p>
<p>model. A fuzzy set presents the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; an area that represents the fuzzy population;
</p>
<p>&bull; the semantic representation associated fuzzy population;
</p>
<p>&bull; a function that defines the degree of membership of an element from the fuzzy
</p>
<p>population to the set.
</p>
<p>Unlike bivalent logic, in which membership degree of an element to the set can
</p>
<p>have two values, in fuzzy logic it can have any real value in the [0, 1] range.
</p>
<p>The major advantage of this logic is that it operates with sets which by definition
</p>
<p>are characterized by continue and normal membership functions.
</p>
<p>Fuzzy logic can be used with success in real applications, where there are many
</p>
<p>uncertainties in mathematical models (both in the objective function and con-
</p>
<p>straints). But, these uncertainties can be modelled using the FTs. Designed to work
</p>
<p>with uncertain data, the fuzzy techniques can be applied in most industry sectors

<p>process control. Thus, the control and regulation of industrial processes are areas
</p>
<p>where fuzzy techniques found a breeding ground for their application.
</p>
<p>20.2.4 Evolutionary Programming
</p>
<p>Evolutionary programming (EP) searches an optimal solution by evaluating a set of
</p>
<p>candidate solutions, over a number of generations or iterations. In each iteration,
</p>
<p>another set is formed, starting from the existing set, using the mutation operator.
</p>
<p>Thus, a new solution is obtained, by disturbing each element of the existing solution
</p>
<p>by a random value. The optimality degree of o each candidate solution or individual
</p>
<p>is measured by its fitness, which can be defined based on the objective function of
</p>
<p>the problem. In this case, if a competition scheme is used, the individuals in each
</p>
<p>population compete with each other. The winning individuals will form a resultant
</p>
<p>set, which is regarded as the next generation [26].
</p>
<p>The optimization process must be conducted so that the competitive scheme
</p>
<p>should favour the survival of the better solutions.
</p>
<p>20.2.5 Decision Trees
</p>
<p>Machine learning represents an important AI research domain. This is due to the
</p>
<p>following two aspects:
</p>
<p>&bull; the ability to learn represents a characteristic of an intelligent behaviour;
</p>
<p>&bull; the understanding of the intelligence should be done through the understanding
</p>
<p>of the learning model [29].
</p>
<p>In the last years, the approach based on decision trees (DTs) was used
</p>
<p>increasingly in resolving classification and prediction problems. DTs use a flow
</p>
<p>chart-like tree structure. From the view point of data-mining tools, decision trees

<p>can extract useful information contained in large databases, which can be used in
</p>
<p>decision-making processes.
</p>
<p>A decision tree can have three nodes categories: root, internal, and leaf. The
</p>
<p>structure of a decision tree can be seen in Fig. 20.4.
</p>
<p>If a decision tree is viewed as a logical model, this can indicate a relationship
</p>
<p>between a target variable and a set of predictor variables [29, 30]. The classification
</p>
<p>process will take place in function by separation rules relating to the numerical or
</p>
<p>categorical values of the explanatory variables. Each node will have proper clas-
</p>
<p>sification rules derived from a mathematical process that will minimize the impurity
</p>
<p>of the resulting nodes, using the available learning set. Using these classification
</p>
<p>rules, the leaf nodes will be finally reached [30, 31]. But, for the leaf nodes, the
</p>
<p>separation rules are not applied just like internal nodes. With the help of these
</p>
<p>nodes, the probability of each obtained pattern can be estimated. From the structure
</p>
<p>of a decision tree it can observed that the root and internal nodes indicate a binary
</p>
<p>split test on an attribute. The classification process depends mainly by first node
</p>
<p>(root) that contains all learning set.
</p>
<p>Also, the leaf nodes represent the results of the classification process so that they
</p>
<p>are labelled as targets. From the point of view of the algorithm, in order to generate
</p>
<p>a decision tree, two steps should be covered, namely learning and classification
</p>
<p>[30]. These steps are shown in Fig. 20.5. The available data must be divided in two
</p>
<p>sets: the first set (the learning set) is used in the learning process in order to build
</p>
<p>the structure of the tree, while the second set (the testing set) has the role to assess
</p>
<p>the generalization capability of the tree using new input data. The sizes of the two
</p>
<p>sets are different and depend on the number of elements from the database. The

<p>ratio between the two sets can vary between 90/10 and 60/40%. In the literature, the
</p>
<p>most used method used to generate a decision tree is Classification and Regression
</p>
<p>Trees (CART) method [32, 33].
</p>
<p>This method uses the data recorded in a database during a period of time to
</p>
<p>construct the structure of the decision tree. Also, a number of patterns must be
</p>
<p>introduced from the beginning of the learning process. These patterns can be
</p>
<p>obtained using various techniques (for example, clustering techniques).
</p>
<p>Finally, the information resulted from the learning and classification processes
</p>
<p>can be arranged in a matrix named confusion matrix [34, 35]. Based on this matrix,
</p>
<p>the performance of the classification process can be assessed.
</p>
<p>20.2.6 Clustering Techniques
</p>
<p>Clustering techniques are based on the arranging/organization of an objects/elements
</p>
<p>set into groups (clusters) with similar characteristics. With the help of these tech-
</p>
<p>niques, information can be extracted easily from large databases, such that the
</p>
<p>decision maker understands the existing relationships between recorded data.
</p>
<p>In the clustering process, there are some important steps which the decision
</p>
<p>maker should take into account. The steps are presented in Fig. 20.6 [25, 36, 37].
</p>
<p>Feature selection In this step, the relevant characteristics corresponding to the
</p>
<p>elements/objects from the database will be chosen for the clustering process.
</p>
<p>Clustering algorithm According to the choice of the clustering algorithm, the
</p>
<p>elements/objects from the database can be separated either into clearly defined
</p>
<p>groups, either into fuzzy groups, where each element has a varying degree of
</p>
<p>membership to each resulted group.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Validation of the results In this step, an evaluation of the clustering process is
</p>
<p>made. Usually, an optimization criterion is used. This analysis must be objective
</p>
<p>and it is performed to determine if the results are grouped as accurately as possible.
</p>
<p>Interpretation of the results The decision maker will compare the obtained results
</p>
<p>with other methods. In accordance with the benchmarking, it will reach a conclu-
</p>
<p>sion and it will take a decision.
</p>
<p>In literature, two clustering methods categories were developed: hierarchical
</p>
<p>clustering and K-means clustering.
</p>
<p>Hierarchical clustering In the hierarchical clustering, two type of methods can be
</p>
<p>identified: agglomerative methods, which perform a succession of unifications of
</p>
<p>the n elements from the initial database into clusters, and divisive methods, which
</p>
<p>separate the n elements gradually into finer clusters. The agglomerative techniques
</p>
<p>are easier to implement. The clustering process can be interpreted through a two
</p>
<p>dimensional diagram (dendrogram). This explains the unifications/splits which take
</p>
<p>place in each step.
</p>
<p>The hierarchical clustering can be used for databases with a number up to several
</p>
<p>hundred elements. The methods from this category are differentiated by how the
</p>
<p>similarity between clusters is evaluated. The similarity is determined by computing
</p>
<p>the Euclidean distance. Single linkage clustering (connectedness or minimum
</p>
<p>method), complete linkage clustering (diameter or maximum method), average
</p>
<p>linkage clustering, and the centroid method can be used.
</p>
<p>K-means clustering In this method, the elements are grouped in K clusters (K is a
</p>
<p>positive integer number, introduced a priori) based on the similar characteristics of
</p>
<p>the elements from the database. Initially, the ck centroids of each cluster Ck � S (the
set of clusters), k = 1, &hellip;, K, are chosen randomly. An element xi will be assigned
</p>
<p>to a centroid ck if the distance between them d(xi, ck) is the minimum of all distances
</p>
<p>between this element, xi, and the other centroids. The algorithm has as objective the
</p>
<p>minimization of a squared error function.
</p>
<p>The objective function E will minimize the distance between each element and
</p>
<p>the centroid of the cluster to which the element will be assigned.

<p>Ck � S, k = {1, &hellip;, K});
d(xi, ck) is the Euclidean distance computed between the element xi 2 S, i = 1, &hellip;,
N, and the centroid ck
</p>
<p>In the first step, a set of K centroids will be initiated randomly. Then, the
</p>
<p>algorithm tries to assign each element from the dataset to a cluster when distance
</p>
<p>between it and the centroid is the shortest. Further, the new positions for centroids
</p>
<p>610 G. Grigoras</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>will be recomputed. The iterative process will stop when the positions of centroids
</p>
<p>will not change. After that, the decision maker will verify the validation of the
</p>
<p>obtained results.
</p>
<p>The validation and evaluation of the results must highlight the quality of the
</p>
<p>clustering process. This quality will be evaluated through an analysis that will
</p>
<p>consider the clusters&rsquo; density, sizes and, separation degrees. In the literature, the
</p>
<p>main approaches used for the cluster validation are [38]:
</p>
<p>&bull; external tests&mdash;the results obtained in the clustering process will be compared
</p>
<p>with the results obtained using other databases.
</p>
<p>&bull; internal tests&mdash;the quality of clustering process is evaluated based on the input
</p>
<p>data to validate the division mode of the clusters.
</p>
<p>&bull; relative tests&mdash;the final results are compared using the same clustering algo-
</p>
<p>rithm, but with different parameters.
</p>
<p>The most used tests in clustering analysis are the internal ones. Many of these are
</p>
<p>based on a Silhouette Global Index (SGI). In the determination of this index, the
</p>
<p>following silhouette widths will be evaluated successively: for each sample, for
</p>
<p>each cluster, and for the entire database. The last width represents the average
</p>
<p>silhouette that will be used for validation. Also, with its help, the optimal number of
</p>
<p>clusters will be determined.

</p>

</p>
<p>An interpretation of the Silhouette Global Index is given in [39, 40]:
</p>
<p>&bull; 0.71&ndash;1.0: The formed structure is strong. The results can be trusted.
</p>
<p>&bull; 0.5&ndash;0.7: An acceptable structure of the clusters was obtained.

<p>&bull; 0.26&ndash;0.5: The obtained structure is very poor. Low confidence degree.

<p>&bull; &lt;0.25: The degree of confidence in results is zero. No structure exists.
</p>
<p>Data validity represents the most important step in clustering analysis. Based on
</p>
<p>its results, the decision maker can assess the confidence degree in the relationships
</p>
<p>established between the input data.

<p>20.3 Electrical Energy Consumption Forecasting in Water
</p>
<p>Distribution Systems
</p>
<p>20.3.1 Clustering-Based Approach
</p>
<p>In this section, an extension of the clustering based profiling techniques in the area
</p>
<p>of water distribution systems for electricity consumption forecasting is presented.
</p>
<p>The K-means clustering algorithm will be used for determining the representative
</p>
<p>loading profiles (RLP) of hydrophore stations, and these, together with a statistical
</p>
<p>approach will forecast the electrical energy consumption from the water distribution
</p>
<p>systems [41, 42].
</p>
<p>By knowing the loading profiles of the hydrophore stations, the distribution
</p>
<p>companies can forecast easily the water demand for a certain zone. Based on this
</p>
<p>forecast, these can establish the best energy efficiency strategies. The load profiling
</p>
<p>can represent a more realistic approach for energy consumption forecasting because
</p>
<p>the loads are not monitored in all hydrophore stations at each hour. Thus, a rep-
</p>
<p>resentative loading profile will be attached for each hydrophore station, determined
</p>
<p>based on the different operation conditions (season, type of day, types of supplied
</p>
<p>consumers, energy consumption, water consumption etc.). The sampling interval
</p>
<p>can be 10, 15, 30 or 60 min. In these conditions, the loading profiles can have 144,
</p>
<p>96, 48 or 24 load values. The forecasted profile of a hydrophore station is obtained
</p>
<p>using a representative loading profile and its daily (monthly, yearly, depending the
</p>
<p>case) electric energy consumption.
</p>
<p>20.3.1.1 Load Profiling for Water Hydrophore Stations
</p>
<p>In the profiling process, the clustering techniques can be used for grouping the
</p>
<p>loading profiles recorded in hydrohpore stations (in various measurement cam-
</p>
<p>paigns) in coherent clusters based on their the similarities. Finally, a representative
</p>
<p>loading profile will be attached to each cluster. This profile is achieved if all loading
</p>
<p>profiles belonging to the respective cluster are averaged.
</p>
<p>Each RLP is represented by a vector xi = {xih, h = 1, &hellip;, T} for i = 1, &hellip;, K, and
</p>
<p>the comprehensive set of RLPs is contained in the set P = {xi, i = 1, &hellip;, K}. The
</p>
<p>time scale along the day is partitioned into T time intervals of duration Dth, for
</p>
<p>h = 1, &hellip;, T. Hourly values are used in this chapter. The variables used in the
</p>
<p>612 G. Grigoras</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>calculations are assumed to be represented as constant (average) values within each
</p>
<p>time interval. The clustering process generates K clusters corresponding the hy-
</p>
<p>drophore stations. In the final step, each hydrophore station will have a RLP
</p>
<p>attached, based on its loading characteristics. All steps of the algorithm are pre-
</p>
<p>sented in Fig. 20.7 [41]. Each step will be detailed in the following.
</p>
<p>Measurements After the measurement campaigns performed in each hydrophore
</p>
<p>station from the water distribution system during a certain time period (day, month,
</p>
<p>season, or year), a set of loading profiles will be obtained. The profiles can have a
</p>
<p>certain number of values, according to the used sampling step. After that, all
</p>
<p>loading profiles will be collected into a database.
</p>
<p>Data cleaning and pre-processing Due to the following factors: measurements
</p>
<p>carried out over a long period of time, high number of recorded data, and a spread
</p>
<p>of the hydrophore stations on a large geographical area, the recorded data can be
</p>
<p>affected by communication errors and failures of the measurement equipment.
</p>
<p>These problems will impact the quality of recorded data. In order to remove the
</p>
<p>missing or irregular values from the database of, data pre-processing is required.
</p>
<p>Classification In the classification process, the clustering methods will be used.
</p>
<p>Because the database can have a high number of profiles, the best suited algorithm
</p>
<p>is K-means. In order to use this algorithm, an important aspect is represented by the
</p>
<p>normalization of the loading profiles before starting the clustering process.
</p>
<p>A suitable factor is the energy consumption over the analysed time. This factor is
</p>
<p>used because each hydrophore station has an energy meter with classical mea-
</p>
<p>surement technology.
</p>
<p>Determination of RLPs For each cluster, a representative loading profile will be
</p>
<p>determined by averaging all its assigned profiles. This profile will characterize the

</p>
<p>20.3.1.2 Electrical Load and Energy Consumption Forecasting
</p>
<p>The electrical load and energy consumption forecasting of a water distribution
</p>
<p>system can be made with an improved simulation method which uses the repre-
</p>
<p>sentative loading profiles of the hydrophore stations. The method can be used if the
</p>
<p>following assumptions are considered [41, 42]:
</p>
<p>&bull; the hourly average load is approximately proportional to the electrical energy
</p>
<p>consumption. This load represents a cluster of hydrophore stations from a water
</p>
<p>distribution system during the analysed time period.
</p>
<p>&bull; the hourly average loads have a normal statistical distribution.
</p>
<p>If these assumptions are satisfied, the hourly load in a water distribution system
</p>
<p>can be forecasted with:

<p>20.3.1.3 The Electrical Energy Consumption Forecasting Algorithm
</p>
<p>The algorithm adopts a two stage procedure presented in Fig. 20.8:
</p>
<p>&bull; the use of a clustering technique (K-means method) in the first stage to deal with
</p>
<p>the time evolution of (normalized) electrical load patterns and to determine a
</p>
<p>subset of representative load profiles to be processed in the second stage. At
</p>
<p>each iteration, the clustering outcomes simplify the process of selecting a rel-
</p>
<p>atively small number of profiles corresponding to the hydrophore stations;
</p>
<p>&bull; the use of load simulation in the second stage. This approach is based on a
</p>
<p>statistical method which assumes that the hourly loads have a normal statistical

<p>A. Determination of Representative Load Profiles
</p>
<p>The electrical energy consumption is used in the normalization process of the
</p>
<p>characteristic loading profiles. This normalization factor is used because each
</p>
<p>hydrophore station has measurement meters that record continuously the electrical
</p>
<p>energy consumption. In the next step, the algorithm will determine the optimal
</p>
<p>numbers of clusters with the K-means clustering and an internal test that uses the
</p>
<p>silhouette global index to validate the classification. Subsequently, the representa-
</p>
<p>tive loading profiles (RLP) will be obtained through an averaging process of all
</p>
<p>normalized profiles inside each cluster. In the final step, the representative loading
</p>
<p>profiles will be assigned to all hydrophore stations based on their type.
</p>
<p>B. The Electrical Load Forecasting
</p>
<p>Using information from the clustering process (hourly average values, average
</p>
<p>energy consumption and standard deviation of the distribution of load for each
</p>
<p>hydrophore station from the cluster Ci, i = 1, &hellip;, K and Eq. 20.5, the hourly loads
</p>
<p>of the analyzed water distribution system will be obtained.
</p>
<p>The forecast accuracy depends on the accuracy of information recorded in the
</p>
<p>database. If the real value of the load is known, the forecasting error can be assessed
</p>
<p>using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE):

<p>flow, the pressure growth, the number and nominal power of force pumps located in
</p>
<p>these distribution substations. The stations are equipped with 3 or 4 pumps working
</p>
<p>in parallel, with rated powers in the 2.2&ndash;7.7 kW range. The input data used in the
</p>
<p>analysis is based on a measurements campaign performed during a year. The
</p>
<p>recorded parameters are represented by the consumed active power, the water flow,
</p>
<p>and the pressure of the water in repression and aspiration zones of the pumps in
</p>
<p>each hydrophore station, recorded using a 5 min sampling rate.
</p>
<p>In the pre-processing step, 12 water hydrophore stations were eliminated due to
</p>
<p>missing technical characteristics (the daily water flow, pressure growth and rated
</p>
<p>powers of force pumps located in the stations). Then, the remaining data was
</p>
<p>recorded in a database for each of the remaining stations (73 stations).
</p>
<p>In the analysis, one of the technical characteristic used in the clustering process
</p>
<p>is the pressure growth of the water. This parameter represents the difference
</p>
<p>between the pressures of the water in the repression and aspiration zones of the
</p>
<p>pumps:
</p>
<p>Dp &frac14; prep � pasp &eth;20:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>prep&mdash;the pressure of the water in the repression zone of the pumps;
</p>
<p>pasp&mdash;the pressure of the water in the aspiration zone of the pumps.
</p>
<p>The consumed active powers are represented by loading profiles of the water
</p>
<p>hydrophore stations. The profiles were analysed only for the day when the maxi-
</p>
<p>mum load in the water distribution system was registered. The time interval is
</p>
<p>defined by taking hourly steps within a day, that is, T = 24 and Dth = 1 h.
</p>
<p>In the first step of the clustering process, normalization is applied to all loading
</p>
<p>profiles from the database, using the daily electrical energy consumption as nor-
</p>
<p>malizing factor.

</p>
<p>will verify the classification quality. The optimal solution will correspond to the
</p>
<p>classification that will obtain the highest value for the silhouette global coefficient.

<p>distribution system is taken into account.
</p>
<p>20.3.2 Decision Trees-Based Approach
</p>
<p>20.3.2.1 The Electrical Energy Consumption Forecasting Algorithm
</p>
<p>In this section, a decision trees-based methodology for the daily electrical energy
</p>
<p>consumption forecasting of a water distribution system is presented. The algorithm
</p>
<p>consists of four steps, as presented in Fig. 20.15.
</p>
<p>Firstly, a database of possible primary variables which characterize the beha-
</p>
<p>viour of the water hydrophore stations from the analysed system is built. The choice
</p>
<p>of primary variables is based on the decision maker&rsquo;s experience. The chosen
</p>
<p>variables are: the daily water flow, pressure growth and rated powers of the pumps
</p>
<p>located in the stations. In this step, data preprocessing is also performed. This aspect
</p>
<p>is very important because preprocessing detects/corrects/removes improper data. In
</p>
<p>the following step, the water hydrophore stations will be classified based on their
</p>
<p>daily water flow, pressure growth, and electrical energy consumption, using the
</p>
<p>clustering techniques. The K-means algorithm will be used in the clustering process
</p>
<p>to obtain a finite number of significant patterns with similar behaviour.
</p>
<p>The third step refers to building the decision tree. This tree will explain the
</p>
<p>behaviour of each station with regard to the variables chosen in the second
</p>
<p>step. Thus, by entering the significant variables that explain the technical and
</p>
<p>operational characteristics of the water hydrophore stations, based on the rules that

</p>
<p>In the fourth step, the daily electrical energy consumption forecasting in the
</p>
<p>water distribution system is made using a statistical approach which must satisfy the
</p>
<p>assumptions made in Sect. 20.3.1.2. The used expression in the proposed approach

</p>
<p>20.3.2.2 Results
</p>
<p>The proposed methodology was applied on same database with 85 water hydrophore
</p>
<p>stations presented in Sect. 20.3.1.4. The daily electrical energy consumption is the
</p>
<p>target variable and the technical characteristics are the input variables. Thus, the
</p>
<p>technical variables (the daily water flow, pressure growth, and rated powers of force
</p>
<p>pumps) were recorded for each hydrophore station. In the pre-processing step, 12
</p>
<p>water hydrophore stations were removed due to some incorrect data corresponding
</p>
<p>to the daily water flow or electrical energy consumption. Then, the data for each of
</p>
<p>the remaining stations (73 stations) were stored in a database
</p>
<p>For generating the decision tree, CART method is used. In the first CART stage,
</p>
<p>the number of patterns must be known. The patterns can be obtained with the
</p>
<p>clustering techniques. Using these techniques, a more precise model was obtained
</p>
<p>that, has ability to adapt easily to any other input data set.
</p>
<p>The hydrophore stations were classified in five significant clusters (patterns) by
</p>
<p>their daily water flow (WF), pressure growth (PG) and daily electrical energy
</p>
<p>consumption (W) on the basis of the K-means clustering algorithm. The represen-
</p>
<p>tation of these clusters (patterns) is given in Fig. 20.16. Table 20.3 presents the
</p>
<p>statistical parameters (average and standard deviation) for each input variable
</p>
<p>corresponding to all clusters.

<p>The rule set that characterizes the decision tree obtained is presented in
</p>
<p>Table 20.4. The confusion matrix corresponding to the classification process, for
</p>
<p>the learning database, is presented in Table 20.5.
</p>
<p>The analysis of data from Table 20.5 indicated that all stations from Clusters 1,
</p>
<p>3, and 4 were classified correctly, and only 4 stations (3 stations from Cluster 2 and
</p>
<p>1 station from Cluster 5) were misclassified. Thus, it can be seen that for the
</p>
<p>learning database, the accuracy rate is 0.94.
</p>
<p>This decision tree structure was verified on the test database. The results are
</p>
<p>presented in Table 20.6, corresponding to the confusion matrix. Only one station
</p>
<p>from Cluster 1 was misclassified, so that the accuracy rate is 0.96.
</p>
<p>In the final stage, using information from the classification process (Table 20.3
</p>
<p>and Eq. 20.10) the daily electrical energy consumption in the analysed water dis-
</p>
<p>tribution system was obtained, as in Fig. 20.18. The forecasting error is 0.7% (17.77
</p>
<p>kWh), which is better than the expected one by water companies (2&ndash;3%) [43].
</p>
<p>20.4 Conclusions
</p>
<p>A proper evaluation of the existing linkage between the two important components
</p>
<p>from human life (water and energy) can lead to saving both money and resources by
</p>
<p>water distribution companies. The investigation methods, which take in account the
</p>
<p>aspects of the two components, can lead to increasing energy efficiency in order to
</p>
<p>minimize electricity consumption in water distribution systems.
</p>
<p>In this study, two approaches based on AI techniques (clustering and decision
</p>
<p>trees) for forecasting the amount of energy consumed in water use are presented.
</p>
<p>These approaches are tested on a real water distribution system from Romania.
</p>
<p>The first approach is based on two stages in which the K-means clustering
</p>
<p>algorithm and a load simulation technique are exploited the electrical energy
</p>
<p>consumption forecasting. The K-means clustering algorithm was used in the pro-
</p>
<p>filing process to obtain the representative loading profiles of the hydrophore sta-
</p>
<p>tions. The electrical energy consumption was forecasted using statistical techniques.
</p>
<p>The mean absolute percentage error in the forecasting process was 2.42%.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The second approach is based on a set of input data processed through the K-
</p>
<p>means clustering algorithm, and then on a decision tree through with which the
</p>
<p>daily electrical energy consumption for one or more hydrophore stations, depending
</p>
<p>on some input variables (the water flow and the pressure of the water in repression
</p>
<p>and aspiration zones of the pumps) was estimated with a very good accuracy. The
</p>
<p>forecasting error for electrical energy consumption was 0.7%.
</p>
<p>Using these approaches, the forecasting errors of the electrical energy con-
</p>
<p>sumption are very close or even better than the ones expected by water companies
</p>
<p>(between 2 and 3%).
</p>
<p>In both case studies, the results obtained demonstrate the utility of the AI
</p>
<p>techniques in resolving problems in water distribution systems operation. The
</p>
<p>solutions proposed can improve decision making, in order to ensure an efficient
</p>
<p>management in the water distribution systems.

<p>Abstract The following chapter provides an overview about available knowledge,
</p>
<p>references and investigations on the active and passive flow control devices, ini-
</p>
<p>tially developed for aeronautic industry that are currently being investigated and
</p>
<p>introduced on wind turbines. The main goal pursued with the introduction of these
</p>
<p>devices is to delay the boundary layer separation and enhance/suppress turbulences.
</p>
<p>The aim is to achieve a lift enhancement, drag reduction or flow-induced noise
</p>
<p>reduction among other parameters. However, achieving these goals present some
</p>
<p>issues, because the improvement of one of these parameters may suppose an
</p>
<p>undesired effect in another. For this reason it is necessary to study in detail each one
</p>
<p>of these devices, their operating concept, applications and their main advantages
</p>
<p>and drawbacks. Depending on the flow control nature, devices can be classified as
</p>
<p>actives or passives. Passive techniques allow to improve the performance of the

<p>21.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Nowadays, the depletion of global fossil fuel reserves, the environmental con-
</p>
<p>cerning and energy security after recent accidents as happened in Fukushima
</p>
<p>nuclear plant in Japan in 2011, has served to focus attention on the development of
</p>
<p>ecologically compatible and renewable energy sources. Besides, the power demand
</p>
<p>is also increasing more and more through new emergent economies as China, Brazil
</p>
<p>or India.
</p>
<p>At this point, the optimization of renewable power systems (wind, solar thermal,
</p>
<p>biomass, etc.) is a key point to be able to compete in energy production and cost
</p>
<p>against the traditional energies. Wind energy becomes in a promising technology
</p>
<p>able to provide a large portion of the power requirements in many countries of the
</p>
<p>world. Wind turbines are a practical way to capture and convert the kinetic energy
</p>
<p>of the atmospheric air to either mechanic or, consequently, electrical energy.
</p>
<p>According to EWEA [1] (European Wind Energy Association) wind power is
</p>
<p>the generating technology with the highest rate for new installations in 2014,
</p>
<p>representing the 43.7% of total power capacity, an increment of 12% in relation to
</p>
<p>2013. Since 2000, 29.4% of new capacity installed in Europe has been wind power,
</p>
<p>56.2% renewables and 91.1% renewables and gas combined.
</p>
<p>The total wind power generating capacity has been increasing continuously, not
</p>
<p>only in Europe but worldwide for the last 15 years [2], as it can be seen in
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.1.
</p>
<p>In 2015, China was the country which led the wind capacity installed, with
</p>
<p>almost a half of the total 63.000 MW, followed by the USA and Germany.
</p>
<p>12.105 MW of the global amount capacity until 2015 corresponds to offshore
</p>
<p>installations being UK, Germany and Denmark the countries with more wind
</p>
<p>capacity installed of this type (5061, 3295 and 1271 MW respectively).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>However, even though the wind cost of energy has decreased in the last decade,
</p>
<p>a high initial investment is yet required, so it is necessary to improve its lifetime and
</p>
<p>efficiency in order to keep it economically viable.
</p>
<p>There are several research fields to achieve this goal. Development of new
</p>
<p>materials which allow to reduce the structure weight or new blade designs just to
</p>
<p>reduce the fatigue loads and increase the aerodynamic performance of the rotors,
</p>
<p>are some of them. CFD simulations become a very interesting tool to study the
</p>
<p>behavior of this new improvements and their impact in wind turbines.
</p>
<p>The considerable growth of wind turbines size and weight in the last years has
</p>
<p>made it impossible to control as they were controlled 30 years ago. Rotors of 120 m
</p>
<p>are now a reality. Johnson et al. [3] compiled some of the most important load
</p>
<p>control techniques that could be used in wind turbines to assure a safe and optimal
</p>
<p>operation under a variety of atmospheric conditions. They include blades made of
</p>
<p>soft, flexible materials that change shape in response to wind speed or aerodynamic
</p>
<p>loads, aerodynamically-shaped rotating towers, flexible rotor systems with hinged
</p>
<p>blades and other advanced control systems.
</p>
<p>The higher the size of a wind turbine the higher the structural and fatigue loads.
</p>
<p>By researching and working in new and innovative load control techniques a
</p>
<p>decrease of these excessive loads could be achieved, which affect the rotor and
</p>
<p>other key components of the turbine. Loads on wind turbines are normally divided
</p>
<p>into extreme structural loads and fatigue loads. Reducing these fatigue loads is a
</p>
<p>main goal, which can reduce the maintenance costs and improve the reliability of
</p>
<p>wind turbines.
</p>
<p>21.2 Wind Turbine Improvement Goals
</p>
<p>The improvements of wind turbines present 3 key points [4]:
</p>
<p>1. Setting upper bounds on and limiting the torque and power experienced by the
</p>
<p>drive train, mainly the low-speed shaft.
</p>
<p>2. Minimize the fatigue life extraction from the rotor drive train and other struc-
</p>
<p>tural components due to changes in wind direction, speed (including gusts), and
</p>
<p>turbulence, as well as start-stop cycles of the wind turbine.
</p>
<p>3. Maximize the energy production.
</p>
<p>The cost of energy (COE) [5] plays an important role inside this last key point, in
</p>
<p>order to maintain this kind of energy as a viable alternative in economic terms with
</p>
<p>traditional or other renewable energies. There are three independent variables to
</p>
<p>calculate its value as we can see in (Eq. 21.1): the total energy captured by the
</p>
<p>turbine and the costs related with the turbine (capital cost) and with the operation
</p>
<p>and maintenance (O&amp;M) works.

&eth;21:1&THORN;
</p>
<p>The loads, directly related with the second key point, can be separated into
</p>
<p>aerodynamics and structural loads. The relative velocities around the blade sections,
</p>
<p>as a result of horizontal or vertical wind shear, turbulences and yaw and tilt
</p>
<p>misalignment, influence the aerodynamic loads on the rotor. The gravitational
</p>
<p>forces can also play a role producing periodic structural loads in the rotor blades.
</p>
<p>Control systems should be able to reduce and minimize the variation of these
</p>
<p>aerodynamic loads or to add damping to the structural nodes.
</p>
<p>First of all, it is essential to know the relationship between the wind speed and
</p>
<p>the normalized power in a wind turbine. There are four different operating regions,
</p>
<p>as shown in Fig. 21.2, which define the power curve.
</p>
<p>In Region 1, the wind speed is not enough to power generation. In Region 2,
</p>
<p>which lies between the cut-in velocity (Vcut-in) and rated velocity (Vrated), the
</p>
<p>generator works under the rated power. In Region 3, the power output is limited by
</p>
<p>the turbine. This happens when there is enough wind intensity for the turbine to
</p>
<p>reach its rated output power. The Region 4 corresponds to higher wind speed,
</p>
<p>which could shut down the turbine and even cause damage in the blades or structure
</p>
<p>of the wind turbine, with the resulting impact on maintenance costs.
</p>
<p>The curve which separates the regions 1 and 2 shows a basic law about gen-
</p>
<p>eration of power, where the power is directly related to the wind speed cubed. (See
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.3).

<p>21.3 Flow Control Devices Classification
</p>
<p>Through the last decades many different flow control devices have been developed.
</p>
<p>Most of them were created for aeronautical issues and this was its first research field
</p>
<p>and application. Nowadays researchers are working to optimize and introduce this
</p>
<p>type of devices in wind turbines. Wood [6] developed a four layer scheme which
</p>
<p>allows to classify the different concepts that are part of all flow control devices
</p>
<p>(See Fig. 21.4).

<p>1st Layer
</p>
<p>According to the technique:
</p>
<p>1. Geometric device (G): Modify the geometry and airfoil shape and thereby the
</p>
<p>airflow about it.
</p>
<p>2. Fluidic device (F): Change the flow about the blade section by either adding air
</p>
<p>into or subtracting air from external flow.
</p>
<p>2nd Layer
</p>
<p>Depending on where the device is set:
</p>
<p>1. Near the leading edge (LE).
</p>
<p>2. Near the trailing edge (TE).
</p>
<p>3. In the mid-chord (MC).
</p>
<p>3rd Layer
</p>
<p>Depending on how the device adjusts the lift curve, flow control devices modify
</p>
<p>the lift curve of an airfoil in two different ways (See Fig. 21.5).
</p>
<p>1. Shifting the curve up (increasing lift) or down (reducing lift). (See Fig. 21.5b).
</p>
<p>2. Extending the lift curve of the airfoil to stall at a higher angle of attack (a). (See
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.5a).
</p>
<p>To alleviate loads successfully, it is indispensable the device to be able to reduce
</p>
<p>the generated lift. With a first watching to Fig. 21.5, it can be seen that delaying
</p>
<p>stall (DS) only increases lift at high angles of attack. For that reason devices based
</p>
<p>on DS concept would not be considered as a good alternative for load mitigation.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a suggestion presented by Corten [7] provides a different way of
</p>
<p>using this type of devices to mitigate turbine loads. Their main purpose is to include
</p>
<p>them to an existent profile to increase CLmax and, consequently, to delay stall. In
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.6 we can see an example with passive vortex generator (VG).

<p>It is known that lift force is defined by the (Eq. 21.5):
</p>
<p>FL &frac14; CLmax �
1
</p>
<p>2
� q � A � v2 &eth;21:5&THORN;
</p>
<p>where (q) is air density in kg/m3, (A) is airfoil area in m2 and (v) is the air velocity
</p>
<p>over the blade in m/s. CLmax is the maximum lift coefficient.
</p>
<p>The idea presented by Corten was to redesign the blade in order that the max-
</p>
<p>imum sectional lift of a blade with a DS device matches that of the original blade
</p>
<p>without a DS device. Figure 21.6 illustrates the difference in chord length between
</p>
<p>both designs. Density and velocity around the blades would be equal at similar
</p>
<p>conditions. So, if CLmax is increased by the effect of the DS device, the chord
</p>
<p>(c) could be reduced an equivalent quantity according to the lift force equation, as it
</p>
<p>can be seen in (Eqs. 21.6 and 21.7).

<p>Depending on device working conditions, we can classify them as steady or

<p>unsteady devices (if the position of a device varies with time about a nominal

</p>
<p>it changes its position to produce a sequence of steady state conditions.

<p>Passive control techniques represent an improvement in the turbine&rsquo;s efficiency

<p>and in loads reduction without external energy consumption. Active control tech-

<p>niques, instead, require external energy or a secondary power source. Even though,
</p>
<p>further investigations must be carried on to make sure that this raise in energy
</p>
<p>output can balance the external energy necessary for load control together with the
</p>
<p>increase in turbine capital and O&amp;M costs.
</p>
<p>Johnson et al. [3] made an analysis and discussed 15 different devices for wind
</p>
<p>turbine control. Some of them are still being tested on full-scale turbines.
</p>
<p>21.4.1 Passive Control Systems
</p>
<p>21.4.1.1 Vortex Generators
</p>
<p>A Vortex Generator (VG) is a passive flow control device which modifies the
</p>
<p>boundary layer fluid motion bringing momentum from the outer flow region into
</p>
<p>the inner flow region of the wall bounded flow. Its main goal is to delay the flow
</p>
<p>separation and increase the maximum lift coefficient CLmax. VGs are designed to
</p>
<p>re-energize the boundary layer by inducing momentum transfer between the free
</p>
<p>stream velocity and the near wall region. The boundary layer separation begins
</p>
<p>when the portion of boundary layer closest to the wall or leading edge reverses in
</p>
<p>flow direction. (See Fig. 21.7). The separation is where the shear stress is null or
</p>
<p>close to under stall conditions.
</p>
<p>Initially introduced by Taylor [8] VGs have been investigated for more than fifty
</p>
<p>years for a wide range of applications in aerodynamics and airplane wings. They are
</p>
<p>small vanes, usually triangular or rectangular, inclined at an angle to the incoming
</p>
<p>flow and placed as close as possible of the leading edge. They are generally
</p>
<p>assembled in a spanwise on the suction side of the blade and present the advantage
</p>
<p>that they can be added as a post-production fix to blades that do not perform as
</p>
<p>expect. Its height is usually similar to the boundary layer thickness.
</p>
<p>21 Flow Control Devices for Wind Turbines 637</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Fernandez-Gamiz et al. [9] studied the behavior of a rectangular VG on a flat
</p>
<p>plane and the streamwise vortices produced by them to investigate how the physics
</p>
<p>of the wake behind VGs in a negligible streamwise pressure gradient flow can be
</p>
<p>reproduced in CFD simulations and their accuracy in comparison with experimental
</p>
<p>observations. (See Fig. 21.8).
</p>
<p>Pearcey [10] noted that the vane type VG can be set in two basic ways, as shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 21.9.
</p>
<p>1. Co-rotating array: the vortices which are shed are all of the same rotational
</p>
<p>direction.
</p>
<p>2. Counter-rotation array: the rotational sense of the vortices alternate along the
</p>
<p>array.
</p>
<p>Godard and Stanislas [11] demonstrated that VGs work most efficiently when
</p>
<p>creating counter-rotating vortices and their geometry is triangular.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In order to study the impact of VGs on wind turbines, to optimize their position
</p>
<p>and distribution, CFD tools can be used. However, modelling a fully-meshed profile
</p>
<p>with VGs becomes prohibitively expensive because of its small size (VGs height
</p>
<p>are usually equal to the boundary layer thickness). This great number of cells in the
</p>
<p>simulation becomes a trouble in computation time and therefore, in costs.
</p>
<p>An alternative way of modeling VGs in CFD is to model the influence of the
</p>
<p>vortex generator on the boundary layer using body forces and boundary conditions
</p>
<p>generated by them. In that way, Bender et al. [12] presented the BAY model for
</p>
<p>simulating the vane vortex generators without the necessity of defining the VG
</p>
<p>geometry in the mesh. Later, Jirasek [13] introduced a new version of this model,
</p>
<p>called jBAY model, based on the lifting force theory.
</p>
<p>Fernandez-Gamiz et al. [14] presented a detailed comparison between four
</p>
<p>different models of VGs on a flat plane. The first one is based on the traditional
</p>
<p>mesh-resolved VG. The second one, called Actuator Vortex Generator Model
</p>
<p>(AcVG), based on [12] provides an efficient method for CFD simulations of flows
</p>
<p>with VG&rsquo;s. The third one is an experimental model (Velte et al. [15]) based in
</p>
<p>experimental data, where measurements were carried out in a low speed
</p>
<p>closed-circuit wind tunnel. The fourth model is the analytical model of the primary
</p>
<p>vortex based on the helical structure of longitudinal embedded vortex. Following
</p>
<p>the same idea, Zamorano et al. [16] studied the evolution of the wake downstream a
</p>
<p>rectangular VG at different incidence angles. &Oslash;ye [17] and Miller [18] compared,
</p>
<p>on a 1 MW wind turbine, the measured power curves with VGs and without them.
</p>
<p>Although they used quite rough methods for the VGs design optimization, both
</p>
<p>studies showed that, in these cases, VGs on average increased the output power for
</p>
<p>nearly all winds.
</p>
<p>These devices present some important advantages, such as their small size, that
</p>
<p>allows to distribute a big number of them along the profile. They are also
</p>
<p>replaceable with no trouble in an inexpensive and uncomplicated way and they
</p>
<p>have the possibility to add them once the aerodynamic profile is built. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, their main disadvantage is the drag increases (CD) that involve the implan-
</p>
<p>tation of this device, an undesirable feature for this kind of applications. Great care
</p>
<p>is also need to be taken in their blade integration not to deteriorate the performance
</p>
<p>of the wind turbine or the aeroelastic conditions.

<p>Case Study: DTU 10 MW Reference Wind Turbine
</p>
<p>The DTU 10 MW RWT (Reference Wind Turbine) is part of the Light Rotor
</p>
<p>Project [19]. Initiated as a cooperation of DTU Wind Energy and Vestas, its main
</p>
<p>goal is to create the design basis for next generation wind turbines of 10 MW
</p>
<p>(See Table 21.1).
</p>
<p>The purpose of this design is [20]:
</p>
<p>1. To achieve a design in a sequential multidisciplinary design optimization
</p>
<p>process.
</p>
<p>2. To obtain a high-quality aerodynamic performance with lower weight.
</p>
<p>3. To achieve a high-detail design for a complete comparison of both aero-elastic
</p>
<p>as well as high fidelity aerodynamic and structural tools.
</p>
<p>4. To provide a openly available design basis for next generation of wind turbines.
</p>
<p>In this project the manufacturing process is not considered, so the design does
</p>
<p>not provide a design to that end. Therefore, the purpose is not to provide a design of
</p>
<p>a complete wind turbine but of the rotor.
</p>
<p>DTU Wind Energy developed some codes used in the design of DTU 10 MW
</p>
<p>RWT.
</p>
<p>1. HAWC2 (Horizontal Axis Wind turbine simulation Code 2nd generation). An
</p>
<p>aeroelastic code proposed for calculating wind turbine response in time domain.
</p>
<p>2. HAWCstab2: (Aero-servo-elastic stability tool for wind turbines).
</p>
<p>3. BECAS. Determines cross section stiffness properties using FEM.

<p>ABAQUS and XFOIL were used as well for the structural design (FEM com-
</p>
<p>putations) and airfoil characteristics respectively.
</p>
<p>Recently, Troldborg et al. [21] presented a case study of the DTU 10 MW RWT,
</p>
<p>making a CFD comparison with and without VGs installed on the inboard part of
</p>
<p>the blades. A personalized version of the BAY model, previously mentioned, was
</p>
<p>used in order to overcome the computational cost of simulating a blade with a large
</p>
<p>number of this type of devices on it. Forty VG pairs are distribute on each blade and
</p>
<p>were setting up in counter-rotation distribution. A grid sensitivity study was per-
</p>
<p>formed, with five different configurations, to check out that the model calculates the
</p>
<p>lift with precision on all grids.
</p>
<p>The EllipSys3D flow solver was implemented which solves, in a steady state
</p>
<p>mode, the incompressible finite volume Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
</p>
<p>equations. A fully developed turbulent boundary layer on the blade surface was
</p>
<p>assumed using the k-x Shear SST Model [22, 23].
</p>
<p>Figure 21.10 illustrates the rotor surface mesh, together with the VGs region as
</p>
<p>can be seen with a little more detail in the second picture, corresponding to 8 cells
</p>
<p>per VG pair and for a height of the first boundary layer of 2 � 10&minus;6 m in order to
obtain a y+ &lt; 2.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The results of the simulations, in a blade with VGs, showed an increase in both
</p>
<p>tangential and normal forces at the inboard part of the blade. At the outer part of the
</p>
<p>blade, however, a slight reduction in both forces was appreciated in the case with
</p>
<p>VGs installed. The power improvement caused by the VGs is 0.51% in the best
</p>
<p>scenario studied corresponding to a wind speed of 10 m/s. Figure 21.11 shows the
</p>
<p>lift and drag curves with and without VGs at a radial position r = 24 m. It can be
</p>
<p>seen how the VGs increase the lift for a broad series of angles of attack but, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, involve a more abrupt stall which finally causes a higher drag and a
</p>
<p>lower lift.
</p>
<p>The simulations showed a good adjustment between CFD results and wind
</p>
<p>tunnel experiments, so the 8 grid cells per VG pair can be considered enough to
</p>
<p>capture the effect of them.
</p>
<p>21.4.1.2 Microtabs
</p>
<p>The microtabs consist on small tabs situated near the TE of an airfoil, which
</p>
<p>projects perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil a few percent of the chord length
</p>
<p>(1&ndash;2% c) corresponding to the boundary layer thickness.
</p>
<p>The small movement of these microtabs jets the flow in the boundary layer away
</p>
<p>from the blade&rsquo;s surface, bringing a recirculation zone behind the tab, as can be
</p>
<p>observed in Fig. 21.12 affects the aerodynamics shifting the point of flow separation
</p>
<p>and, therefore, providing changes in lift. Lift improvement is obtained by deploying
</p>
<p>the microtab downwards (on the pressure side) and lift reduction is obtained by
</p>
<p>deploying the microtab upwards (on the suction side).
</p>
<p>Van Dam [25] has made multiple studies and investigations into this topic,
</p>
<p>including CFD simulations and wind-tunnel experiments in order to determine their
</p>
<p>optimal distribution height and location. The results provided, as previous studies,
</p>
<p>that the best place to situate the lower surface tab with respect to lift and drag was
</p>
<p>around 95% c with a height of 1% c and around 90% c for the upper surface tab.
</p>
<p>They present some appealing features for wind turbine control applications:

<p>1. Small size.
</p>
<p>2. Low power requirements for its activation.
</p>
<p>3. Simplicity of the design (low cost).
</p>
<p>4. They can be installed without significant changes in the actual techniques to
</p>
<p>manufacture the profiles.
</p>
<p>Case Study: New Design of a Microtab Deployment Mechanism
</p>
<p>The existing microtab device system described before presents two main drawbacks
</p>
<p>(See Fig. 21.13):
</p>
<p>1. The insufficient tab height when it is fully-deployed.
</p>
<p>2. The actuating mechanism which causes stiction during tab deployment.
</p>
<p>Tsai et al. [26] presented recently and innovative design to improve the
</p>
<p>microtabs performance. The new microtab system is based on a four-bar linkage
</p>
<p>that overcomes the two disadvantages previously mentioned and providing:
</p>
<p>1. An increase of the maximum tab height in relation to the existing microtab
</p>
<p>system. From 1 to 1.7% c.
</p>
<p>2. A higher stability due to the four-bar linkage mechanism.
</p>
<p>The four-bar linkage mechanism has four links and pivot joints (See Fig. 21.14);
</p>
<p>and therefore a DOF = 1. The degree of freedom (DOF) of a mechanism, i.e. the
</p>
<p>number of independent moves it has, is defined by Gruebler&rsquo;s equation:
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.12 Microtab concept and zoom of streamlines around a trailing-edge region during tab
</p>
<p>pressure side deployment (Chow and Van Dam) [24]
</p>

</p>
<p>actuation system [26]

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>DOF &frac14; 3 N � 1&eth; &THORN; � 2M &eth;21:8&THORN;
</p>
<p>where M is the number of pivot joints and N is the number of links.
</p>
<p>The input link is connected to an actuator which is the responsible for controlling
</p>
<p>the movement of the system, retracting or extending the microtab. Due to the space
</p>
<p>limitations in the trailing edge, the microtab cannot be positioned normal to the
</p>
<p>lower surface but a tilting angle is required. The steadiness and reliability
</p>
<p>improvement is achieved using five links (three input links and two output links)
</p>
<p>instead of the lever arm which is used in the existing microtabs.
</p>
<p>In normal conditions, this new microtab will describes a curved trajectory
</p>
<p>throughout its deployment and retraction. To avoid that and to remain a simple
</p>
<p>straight line motion the actuator input bar is transformed into a V-shape. The
</p>
<p>measurements of the links and their angles, the stroke length and the slot length
</p>
<p>were also calculated as well as the force of the actuator.
</p>
<p>21.4.1.3 Serrated Trailing Edge
</p>
<p>Wind turbine noise is one of the main issues for the widespread use of wind energy.
</p>
<p>The sources of aerodynamic noise can be divided into [27]:
</p>
<p>1. Airfoil self-noise: is produced by the blade in an undisturbed inflow and it is
</p>
<p>caused due to the interaction between an airfoil blade and the turbulence pro-
</p>
<p>duced in its own boundary layer and near wake. Self-noise can be tonal or
</p>
<p>broadband in character and may be caused by several mechanisms, such as
</p>
<p>laminar boundary-layer vortex-shedding noise, turbulent boundary-layer/trailing
</p>
<p>edge interaction noise (trailing-edge noise), blade tip noise or trailing-edge
</p>
<p>bluntness noise.
</p>
<p>2. Inflow-turbulence noise: it depends on the atmospheric conditions and it is
</p>
<p>caused by the interaction of upstream atmospheric turbulence with the blade.
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.14 Four-bar linkage scheme and the new scheme which is used for the microtab
</p>
<p>644 I. Aramendia et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Originally, the aerodynamic surfaces of wind turbine blades have sharp or
</p>
<p>moderately blunt trailing edges from which the wake is shed. The shedding of the
</p>
<p>wake and the confluence of flow from the pressure and suction sides of the profile
</p>
<p>are sources of aerodynamic noise, and increased drag and reduced lift. It has long
</p>
<p>been recognized that airfoil trailing edge noise may be reduced by modifying the
</p>
<p>trailing edge geometry so that the efficiency by which vorticity is scattered into
</p>
<p>sound is reduced. One alternative to resolve this trouble was patented by Siemens
</p>
<p>[28] and consists in a flexible serrated trailing edge, also known as Dino Tail,
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 21.15.
</p>
<p>Over the years, the characteristics and properties of airfoil noise have been
</p>
<p>studied extensively in both theoretical and experimental investigations. Both inflow
</p>
<p>turbulence and self-noise mechanisms were considered and dependence on
</p>
<p>parameters such as flow speed, angle of attack or radiation direction was studied by
</p>
<p>Howe [29]. About experimental studies, Oerlemans et al. [30] carried out different
</p>
<p>investigations where they tested the noise reduction in NACA 64418 airfoil and in
</p>
<p>blades of 2.3 MW wind turbine.
</p>
<p>As an added aerodynamic profile, it presents the advantage of creating a cus-
</p>
<p>tomized geometry profile for each device according to the operating conditions in
</p>
<p>which it is located (See Fig. 21.16).
</p>
<p>21.4.1.4 Fences
</p>
<p>Fences, a system patented in 2009, consist in fin-like vertical surfaces attached to
</p>
<p>the upper surfaces of the wing that are used to control the airflow [31]. Their
</p>
<p>purpose is to disrupt the spanwise airflow, protecting the outboard wing section
</p>
<p>from a developing inboard stall. So, keeping the outboard section from stalling,
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.15 Wind turbine blade with serrated trailing edge device
</p>
<p>21 Flow Control Devices for Wind Turbines 645</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>aileron effectiveness is maintained during a stall, enabling the pilot to keep the
</p>
<p>aircraft level and exit the stall safety.
</p>
<p>On straight wing airplanes they control the airflow in the flap area and on swept
</p>
<p>wing airplanes they prevent the accumulation of air toward the tip at high angles of
</p>
<p>attack placing them at about two-thirds of the way out towards the wing tip. In both
</p>
<p>cases, they give better slow speed handling and stall characteristics (See Fig. 21.17).
</p>
<p>On wind turbines, the airflow also spreads in spanwise direction of the blades.
</p>
<p>This airflow generate adverse consequences in wind turbines performance, partic-
</p>
<p>ularly because contribute to the separation of the main airflow of the blade surface,
</p>
<p>and therefore, reduce the rotor blade lift.
</p>
<p>In order to fix that problem a fence is placed (See Fig. 21.18) extending through
</p>
<p>the entire blade surface in chord-wise direction, to prevent the creation of these
</p>
<p>airflows. This barrier or wall delay this effect by preventing the spanwise flow from
</p>
<p>moving too far along the wing and gaining speed.
</p>
<p>The extent to which the fence is able to prevent these airflows is directly related
</p>
<p>to the fence height. However, the higher the height, the higher the weight, besides
</p>
<p>the fact that it affects to other aerodynamic characteristics of the blade, as the lift.
</p>
<p>So, it comes to choose a fence design that does not get worse the blade qualities,
</p>
<p>even though does not remove the spanwise airflow completely.
</p>
<p>The required height and length of the particular planar element and the optimal
</p>
<p>position of this element on the suction side of the rotor blade inherently varies with
</p>
<p>the distance from the rotor axis of rotation, the blade contour depth, the rotor width,
</p>
<p>the most likely speed of the incident airflow, etc. So, the best configuration is
</p>
<p>determined empirically.

<p>Chow and Van Dam [32] made a fence height study with an NREL 5-MW blade
</p>
<p>of 63 m span. The fence height study was made at the same constant spanwise
</p>
<p>location or maximum chord location, at 13.7 m from the blade baseline.
</p>
<p>Figure 21.19 illustrates the percent change in power and thrust for different fence
</p>
<p>heights, for a free stream velocity of 11 m/s and rotor speed of 11.89RPM. It can be
</p>
<p>appreciated a nearly constant difference between power and thrust for large fence
</p>
<p>heights (hfence &gt; 5%cmax) and the maximum power values for heights between 1
</p>
<p>and 2.5%cmax. The thrust and power curves are very pronounced for small fence
</p>
<p>heights (hfence &lt; 3%cmax). At the spanwise position of 2%cmax is located the most
</p>
<p>favorable fence height, with a power increase of 0.67% and a thrust increase of

<p>0.34% (See Fig. 21.19).
</p>
<p>The previous study was made at the same constant spanwise location or maxi-

<p>11.89RPM, respectively). Figure 21.20 illustrates the thrust and power curves and
</p>
<p>their relation, almost constant over the entire range of spanwise locations studied,
</p>
<p>with a relatively larger increment in power capture of 0.15% in comparison to
</p>
<p>thrust. The effectiveness of the fences clearly gets worse when fences are located
</p>
<p>further and further outboard beyond maximum chord.
</p>
<p>21.4.1.5 Spoilers
</p>
<p>In general terms, the shape of a wind turbine blade can be defined in three regions
</p>
<p>(See Fig. 21.21)
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.20 Percent change in rotor power and thrust for various fences located at various
</p>
<p>spanwise fence locations relative to the baseline NREL 5 MW blade (Chow and Van Dam [32])

<p>1. The nearest region to the hub (circular section).
</p>
<p>2. The transition region between the circular section and the airfoil region.
</p>
<p>3. The airfoil region.
</p>
<p>The root and transition region, because of their section, do not help to the energy
</p>
<p>production of the wind turbine and even decreases it due to drag. These sections of
</p>
<p>wind turbines often work in stall situations, especially at high wind speeds.
</p>
<p>Therefore it is desirable a mechanism, such as spoilers [33], to increase the lift on
</p>
<p>these conditions (and not to stop) and for increasing the power generated by the
</p>
<p>turbine. The spoiler is assembled in the inboard part of the blade, i.e. the part
</p>
<p>nearest the hub, and particularly to the transition region of the blade, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.22. A realistic estimate of the potential performance improvement is
</p>
<p>1&ndash;1.5% of annual energy yield compared to conventional wind turbine blades
</p>
<p>without such spoilers. This provides a substantial economic benefit compared to the
</p>
<p>additional manufacturing costs related to the manufacturing of blades with such
</p>
<p>spoilers. However, this device presents a main disadvantage for its application in
</p>
<p>wind turbines against aerodynamics, the fact that the blades must work with higher
</p>
<p>angles of incidence.
</p>
<p>21.4.2 Active Control Systems
</p>
<p>21.4.2.1 Traditional Trailing-Edge Flaps
</p>
<p>Before coming as a candidate for wind turbine control, traditional trailing-edge
</p>
<p>flaps were used previously with good results in aircraft load control. The National
</p>
<p>Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) began and carried out their investigations
</p>
<p>throughout the 1990s in order to improve wind turbines performance with this type
</p>
<p>of active control system.
</p>
<p>The trailing-edge flaps vary the airfoil camber. The lift and the camber line,
</p>
<p>which is a measure of the amount of airfoil curvature, are directly related. The more
</p>
<p>curve the camber line is, the more lift the airfoil will generate. So, deploying the
</p>
<p>flap on the pressure side a lift increase is obtained and deploying it on the suction
</p>
<p>side a lift reduction is obtained.
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.22 Airfoil with
</p>
<p>discrete flap and flexible flap
</p>
<p>21 Flow Control Devices for Wind Turbines 649</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>They can be assembled in two ways: either as discrete flaps or flexible flaps (See
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.22).
</p>
<p>1. Discrete trailing-edge flap: Conventionally used in aircraft, also known as
</p>
<p>ailerons are assembled in the blade (hinged) and require a moment over the
</p>
<p>hinge to achieve the required position. They provide good results in terms of
</p>
<p>power regulation and load alleviation. The development cost to integrate them in
</p>
<p>the blade should not be high considering all the background experience with this
</p>
<p>type of device in aviation.
</p>
<p>2. Flexible trailing-edge flap: Their addition into the wind turbine blade is similar
</p>
<p>than discrete flaps. However, in this case there is no need for implementing
</p>
<p>rotating shafts mounted at the sides of the flaps. Therefore it is possible to
</p>
<p>produce the flexible flaps in modules which are attached to the blade only via a
</p>
<p>single connecting surface.
</p>
<p>Its application in wind turbines presents some drawbacks, such as the size and
</p>
<p>weight that can reach the device and the mechanical actuators necessaries for its
</p>
<p>deployment. The aero-acoustic noise during operation and the energy required for
</p>
<p>deployment are some pending parameters to improve for its application.
</p>
<p>21.4.2.2 Air Jet Vortex Generators
</p>
<p>The air jet vortex generator (AJVG) was first suggested by Wallis et al. [34], where
</p>
<p>circular jets issuing from a surface (airfoil) were used to produce &ldquo;persistent
</p>
<p>velocity&rdquo; for the purpose of delaying turbulent separation. It was discovered that a
</p>
<p>normal jet issuing into the free stream would produce a pair weak counter-rotating
</p>
<p>vortices that would pass downstream. Wallis chose a cross-stream jet that was
</p>
<p>angled at a pitch angle of 45&deg; to the airfoil surface. The vortex remains embedded in
</p>
<p>the boundary layer over the airfoil and entrains high-momentum air from the
</p>
<p>undisturbed flow into the boundary layer. This process helps mitigate boundary
</p>
<p>layer separation and leads to an increase in CLmax and angle of attack at stall astall
(See Fig. 21.23).
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.23 Schematic of AJVG actuator with a pitch angle of 30&deg; and streamlines representation
</p>
<p>in a wind turbine blade [3]
</p>
<p>650 I. Aramendia et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Johnston and Nishi [35], in 1990, studied more in detail the AJVG choosing a
</p>
<p>number of simple cases to assess the effects of the vortices. However, there was a
</p>
<p>problem in this study with the measurement system because the scale of the vortex
</p>
<p>compared to the size of the hole-probe (used to derive the vorticity in the cross-flow
</p>
<p>plane) and the sampling grid was quite small. Consequently, it was not possible to
</p>
<p>sample the vorticity in the region where the vortex was close to the wall, so too
</p>
<p>much information of the vortex was lost.
</p>
<p>A study by Compton and Johnston [36] in 1992 showed that, even for the
</p>
<p>strongest case tested, the air-jet was qualitatively compared with the vortex pro-
</p>
<p>duced from a VG but the dissipation of the vorticity takes place at a much greater
</p>
<p>rate for the AJVG.
</p>
<p>Lately, investigations with pulsed vortex generator jets (PVGJ), which are
</p>
<p>placed in the leading edge, have been gaining interest because they are more
</p>
<p>effective in delaying stall due to two factors mainly:
</p>
<p>1. The improved vorticity production related with the impulsively started jet flow.
</p>
<p>2. The reduction in mass flow compared to steady jets due to the reduced duty
</p>
<p>cycle.
</p>
<p>The AJVG presents some interesting characteristics for wind turbine applica-
</p>
<p>tions. One of the most important is its wide controllability, which allows to modify
</p>
<p>the parameters of vortex generation according to the circumstances. Its location in
</p>
<p>the leading edge makes it easy to install, however, it requires the installation of
</p>
<p>compressed air lines and determine how much air would be necessary and its power
</p>
<p>expenditure. Other factor that must be taken into account is to maintain the exit
</p>
<p>ports free of outside influences (insects, dirt or ice).
</p>
<p>21.4.2.3 Synthetic Jets
</p>
<p>Initially investigated by James et al. [37] in 1996, this type of active flow control
</p>
<p>creates streamwise vortex similar to those created by PVGJ but with a significant
</p>
<p>difference, a synthetic jet adds momentum to airflow without adding mass.
</p>
<p>A conventional jet sucks in air, accelerates this air, and exhausts the air out of a
</p>
<p>different opening, maintaining airflow. In contrast, a synthetic jet alternates sucking
</p>
<p>in and blowing out air through the same opening at high frequencies. One method
</p>
<p>for creating this jet is to use a piezoelectric diaphragm to act as the oscillating
</p>
<p>membrane. When this membrane oscillates, it sends puffs of air through the cavity
</p>
<p>and out of a small surface hole. Figure 21.24 illustrates the operating principle of
</p>
<p>this type of active control device.
</p>
<p>Pechlivanoglou [38] summarized the main characteristics of synthetic jets, their
</p>
<p>mechanical structure, integration, costs and reliability. They are usually located at
</p>
<p>10&ndash;20% c (close to the leading edge) and can be installed at any angle to the
</p>
<p>aerodynamic surface. In this case there would not be any problem in terms of space
</p>
<p>to integrate the synthetic jets. Another factor to be taken into account about their
</p>
<p>21 Flow Control Devices for Wind Turbines 651</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>integration in wind turbine blades is the structural consequences of the surface
</p>
<p>discontinuities caused by the synthetic jet slots/holes. The most possible solution to
</p>
<p>mitigate this trouble would be the integration of additional parts in the blade
</p>
<p>structure and consequently, changing the laminate structure of the blade.
</p>
<p>The existence of synthetic jet mechanisms inside the blade structure increases
</p>
<p>the complexity of the blade as well as the required maintenance effort. For this
</p>
<p>reason the flow control mechanisms (individual or integrated in inserted units)
</p>
<p>should be removable and replaceable in such a way that their maintenance and
</p>
<p>replacement is fast and cost effective.
</p>
<p>Numerous investigations, experimental [39] and numerical [40] have supported
</p>
<p>the efficiency of this device in aerodynamics achieving significant maximum lift
</p>
<p>increases, about 29%, and delaying boundary layer separation.
</p>
<p>21.5 Energy Efficiency of Active and Passive
</p>
<p>Flow Control Devices
</p>
<p>The cost of electricity generated by wind turbines depends on the location of the
</p>
<p>wind farm, i.e. the number of full load hours per year. In low wind areas the costs
</p>
<p>ranges from 0.05 to 0.07 &euro;/kWh and at windy coastal areas the costs ranges from
</p>
<p>0.09 to 0.11 &euro;/kWh [41]. A place at the highest point possible and away from
</p>
<p>obstructions (forests, towers, rocky outcrops) corresponds to the best location for a
</p>
<p>wind turbine, where the wind can concentrate and get higher speeds.
</p>
<p>Currently, it is not easy to quantify in terms of profits the improvement of these
</p>
<p>flow control devices because it depends on many variables such as the size and
</p>
<p>weight of each wind turbine or the wind speed average over the year. In terms of lift
</p>
<p>enhancement, active control devices, in general, present better results than passive
</p>
<p>control devices, and therefore to improve the energy efficiency of wind turbines,
</p>
<p>even though they are more costly to integrate in the blades and to maintenance.
</p>
<p>Pechlivanoglou [38], with his experimental investigations in large wind tunnel
</p>
<p>facilities testing different flow control devices, could check the advantages and
</p>

</p>
<p>652 I. Aramendia et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>disadvantages that present each device in costs (development, integration, main-
</p>
<p>tenance, operation) and therefore get some preliminary conclusions about the cost
</p>
<p>of energy and their efficiency.
</p>
<p>21.6 Conclusion
</p>
<p>The wind-power sector is growing rapidly and shows evidences that it will continue
</p>
<p>in that way in the following years. The growth of this industry becomes in an
</p>
<p>increase in the size of wind turbines, which leads to an increase in fatigue and
</p>
<p>structural loads that the system have to support. This may also lead to higher O&amp;M
</p>
<p>costs to maintain the structure lifetime. The active and passive flow control devices
</p>
<p>are presented as a solution to these problems. Small size and lightweight are some
</p>
<p>of their main characteristics and can offset turbulent wind loads. Improvements in
</p>
<p>these types of devices can increase the life-cycle of wind turbines, power pro-
</p>
<p>duction, system performance and reduce the COE. This decrease in COE would
</p>
<p>allow to increase the competitiveness in price against traditional sources or other
</p>
<p>renewable alternatives. The purpose of this chapter was not to make a direct
</p>
<p>comparison between the different types of devices, reach a conclusion or make a
</p>
<p>recommendation to choose one device or another. The goal was just to present to
</p>
<p>the reader a review of today&rsquo;s research in this field that could make major contri-
</p>
<p>butions to improve wind turbine control in the next years.
