<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Introduction
What makes this cataloguing book different from other cataloguing
books? This book uncovers the oftentimes nebulous world of cataloguing
unusual kinds of materials that many academic libraries do not collect and
for which there are no set cataloguing guidelines. Libraries cataloguing
materials such as fanzines, movie press kits, popular music CDs, and other
formats are few, although it appears that more and more libraries are
collecting these unusual formats. The problem, therefore, is that many
cataloguers may not have encountered these types of material before and
may not feel comfortable cataloguing them, or are unsure of how to
catalogue them. Therein lies the inspiration for this book. Cataloguing
outside the box relies on the experience of the authors, who routinely
catalogue the very same formats covered here and who seek to assist others
facing the same challenges.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing is sometimes a thankless job. It requires a great deal of
attention to detail, and an understanding of rules and regulations that may
seem useless and completely unnecessary to some in other areas of the
library profession, and certainly to users of the library catalogues we so
religiously populate with data. However, if the bibliographic records are
incomplete or sparse, it is difficult for users to find the information they
need. So, it follows that cataloguers are a necessary spoke in the library
wheel. Cataloguing unfamiliar materials is not an easy task, however.
Cataloguing primary source materials is especially difficult, since many are
rather old and scarce. Frequently there are no examples of records to
examine, and many challenges can arise while cataloguing these valuable
resources. This book aims to be a practical guide for other cataloguers and
for library school students who face these challenges and obstacles. Using
the collections &ndash; of which many of the holdings are themselves fairly old
and scarce &ndash; in the Music Library and Sound Recordings Archives
</p>
<p>xix</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(MLSRA) and the Ray and Pat Browne Library for Popular Culture
Studies (BPCL) at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) as examples, the
authors give practical guidelines for cataloguing such things as: fanzines
(music and popular culture), movie press kits, comic books, popular
fiction, nickel weeklies, and many other kinds of materials. Additionally,
they outline both general and more specific challenges for each type of
material. The book also covers name authority work for these materials,
and the particular challenges that this presents. A thorough background of
the two collections in which the materials reside follows this introductory
section, because in order to fully understand the challenges that they
present a basic understanding of the history of the collections is necessary.
</p>
<p>The examples in the book use primarily AACR2 and MARC, and are of
actual items in the BPCL and MLSRA collections. As examples are
presented, the basics and the challenges are reviewed, in an effort to assist
other cataloguers with similar problematic records. MARC21, used in the
United Kingdom, when compared to the MARC tags used in this book,
has very few differences, if any. Field numbers and associated subfields are
in bold, while actual field values are in italics. There are also some example
records of nickel weeklies that use a modified Dublin Core metadata
standard. The authors use OCLC&rsquo;s Connexion software for finding,
creating, and exporting MARC records into BGSU&rsquo;s library catalogue. The
examples used in this book do not use end punctuation, simply because it
does not appear in BGSU&rsquo;s online catalogue.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that although BGSU relies on the cataloguing
practices outlined in this book, other practices may also be used to
describe these types of item. Each institution has standard and local
practices to guide cataloguers, and so the guidelines in this book should
be modified as necessary. A certain amount of professional judgment
needs to be applied when items do not fit standard AACR2 practices.
</p>
<p>Background of the MLSRA and the BPCL
The MLSRA and BPCL at BGSU began in 1968 and 1969 respectively. The
collections were developed by Bill Schurk and Ray B. Browne to &ldquo;collect
and preserve that which was considered trivial &ndash; if not worthless &ndash; by the
academic community&rdquo; (Boettcher 850). Although the collections began as
one under Schurk&rsquo;s supervision, they were eventually split into two
separate collections and now reside on two separate floors of the Jerome
Library at BGSU.
</p>
<p>xx
</p>
<p>Cataloguing outside the box</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The collections initially held small amounts of materials given by donors
or provided by Schurk and Browne. By 1971, both collections had built to
a substantial amount of materials, including LPs and 45s in the MLSRA
and thousands of books, periodicals, fanzines, and other related materials
in the BPCL. By 1979 the collections had been separated and each had a
head librarian. By 1989, the BPCL had its own floor in the Jerome Library,
as did the MLSRA.
</p>
<p>BPCL collection development policies have changed since 1999,
becoming more refined in an effort to create a more focused collection and
to create space for an ever-growing collection in a place where there is no
space to spare. The primary areas of collection are resources relating to:
popular entertainment (i.e. motion pictures, television, and radio); popular
fiction in the genres of romance, mystery/detective fiction, science
fiction/fantasy, and western/adventure fiction; and the graphic arts (i.e.
comic books, graphic novels, and other items). Other resources in the
collection include, but are not limited to: games, realia, sports
memorabilia, occult materials, popular religion, advertising, cookery,
periodicals, fanzines and manuscript collections. The collection is non-
circulating, except for the DVDs and has a reading room, and a reference
section that can be browsed by anyone. The main focus is on print
materials; however, there are other media in the collection, including: VHS
Star Trek tapes, DVDs, CD-ROMS that accompany books, and cassettes.
Much of the collection has been created through donations from various
individuals since 1969. A budget for new materials is provided through the
library accounts and the departments of Popular Culture and American
Culture Studies. While the majority of the collection has been catalogued
in OCLC, some items, mainly the more specialized collections, will most
likely never be catalogued in OCLC, owing to their nature.
</p>
<p>The MLSRA comprises both circulating and non-circulating collections.
The Music Library (ML) portion is primarily devoted to collecting
materials for the College of Musical Arts (CMA) and includes: books,
scores, periodicals, videos, CDs, and LPs. This is the circulating collection.
The Sound Recordings Archives (SRA) is a non-circulating collection that
is devoted to acquiring and preserving various formats of popular sound
recordings, including: LPs, CDs, 78s, 45s, books, scores, periodicals,
posters, biographical files of performing artists, sheet music, and fanzines.
The collection has grown to over 650,000 recordings and thousands of
books, journals, and sheet music items. About 140,000 LPs have been
catalogued since 1989 and over 15,000 CDs have been catalogued more
recently. While the fanzines are completely catalogued, cataloguing of the
</p>
<p>xxi
</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>sheet music collection is still in progress. Space continues to be an issue for
the SRA collection as new materials are acquired and donations accepted.
</p>
<p>While the main priority of these collections is to support the BGSU
curriculum &ndash; particularly the music, popular culture and American
culture departments &ndash; they have also been important for other
departments on campus and have become internationally known
collections, with scholars from all parts of the globe traveling to BGSU
to use them. The BPCL is also a founding member of the Consortium of
Popular Culture Collections in the Midwest (CPCCM), which currently
consists of Kent State University, Michigan State University, Cleveland
State University, the Ohio Historical Society, the Ohio State University,
and Oberlin College. CPCCM libraries endeavor to coordinate collecting
between institutions so as not to overlap a great deal, and attempt to
direct patrons and/or donors to the appropriate library.
</p>
<p>Although both collections have in the past been recognized
internationally, they have recently become even more visible to users since
numerous materials have been catalogued and the web has made resources
and information accessible to anyone with internet access. Among the items
catalogued in recent years are: comic books, fanzines, dipzines, periodicals,
popular fiction in various formats, popular music CDs, New Music Festival
original compositions, movie and television scripts, and press kits. These
are the special collections materials that are addressed in this book. 
</p>
<p>Brief outline of chapters
Each chapter covers a particular format (e.g. fanzines, movie press kits),
with information about each (e.g. what is a press kit?), the challenges
presented in cataloguing these items, and detailed cataloguing guidelines.
The following is an outline of the materials covered in each chapter. 
</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Examples of cataloguing non-commercially published scores
and recordings for the MidAmerican Center for Contemporary Music
</p>

<p>Self-published music scores and
recordings
</p>
<p>Introduction
The New Music and Arts Festival at Bowling Green State University (BGSU)
began in 1980. Each year in October, the festival includes a number of
master classes, art exhibits, and performances which feature musicians and
artists. Students at BGSU participate in performances and attend master
classes and sessions during the festival. Music scores and other media 
are submitted to the MidAmerican Center for Contemporary Music
(MACCM), are reviewed, and a select number of scores are sent to
performance faculty for additional review. Finally, the approved scores are
distributed to student and professional artists for performance at the festival.
</p>
<p>The scores and other media submitted each year are either returned to
the composer if he/she so chooses or sent to the MLSRA to be catalogued
and added to the New Music Festival Archive Collection. These materials
are typically self-published scores and recordings, though some well-
known composers have also had their works performed at the festivals,
including Philip Glass, John Cage, Joan Tower, and Pauline Oliveros, to
name a few. Since the festival began, the collection has amassed more than
6,500 scores and over 2,000 recordings. It is available for anyone to listen
to and view. Circulation is available to local BGSU patrons, if permitted
by the MACCM. Many of the scores are not available elsewhere, and they
include a wide range of genres and instrumentation.
</p>
<p>Library of Congress (LC) call numbers are assigned to the scores and
accession numbers are assigned for all other formats, such as CDs, LPs,
cassettes, DVDs, and VHS tapes. For example, for a cassette tape a call
number would look something like NMFCAS-0001, and for a DVD
something like NMFDVD-0001. All media formats that accompany
scores are linked to the score without creating a separate bibliographic
record. Any media formats without an accompanying score are
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>catalogued individually in OCLC. Authority records are also created for
each name not already established in OCLC. This aspect will be covered
later, in Chapter 9 on authority work.
</p>
<p>This chapter will cover the various types of scores and recordings found
in the New Music Festival Archive Collection and the ways they are
catalogued at BGSU.
</p>
<p>Challenges
One of the main challenges in cataloguing this collection is the lack of
information. Typical omissions include, but are not limited to: full author&rsquo;s
name, date of composition, full title, instrumentation, and publisher. Because
many of the scores are self-published, some available information is simply
not included in the bibliographic record, which is current practice among
cataloguers. Another challenge is assigning subject headings for unusual
instrumentation not typically covered in LC subject headings. The final
challenge is in housing the scores to put them on the shelves. Most of the
scores are placed in Tyvek envelopes of one of three different sizes, depending
upon the size of the score. However, a number of scores in odd sizes require
custom envelopes, which are made by our conservator at a nearby site.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing self-published music scores
at BGSU
When the scores and recordings arrive at the MLSRA they are usually in
alphabetical order by composer&rsquo;s last name. Recordings, videos, and
other items are separated from the scores and put in alphabetical order
as well. This makes it easier for the cataloguer to organize and catalogue
the materials, particularly when it comes to creating authority records.
Also, some information is usually provided by the MACCM staff, which
typically includes composer, title, instrumentation, date of composition,
and possibly date of birth of the composer. This is also helpful for
cataloguing, as the information is not always visible on the item itself.
</p>
<p>The MARC format for scores is a long-established one. The collection
is catalogued using the scores format, but as a type &ldquo;d&rdquo; manuscript
format, since the scores are unpublished.
</p>
<p>Tables 1.1 and 1.2 show some of the standard fixed and variable field
codes used in cataloguing this collection. The left column lists the
MARC fields, while the right column describes the field values.

<p>As previously stated, these items present several challenges for
cataloguers. These are illustrated in the following examples.
</p>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>Since the score in Example 1.1 is self-published, there is no date or place
of publication information. Date of publication has been estimated in the
260 field as [200&ndash;] and in the date fixed field as 200u (found above in the
008 line), based on the fact that it was submitted for the 2005 New Music
Festival. Based on current practice, the instrumentation statement for
orchestra is listed in the 245 subfield |b section, rather than in a 500 note.
</p>
<p>There was no title page, so the 500 note of Cover title indicates the
primary source of information. The score was also born digital, thus the
500 note Computer printout. The additional 440 series field, 590 local
notes and 710 2 corporate author fields have all been added as part of
the record for local information.

<p>Again, Example 1.2 has no title page, thus the 500 note for Cover title.
The instrumentation is listed in a separate 500 note for medium voice and
piano, since it is not included on the cover. This is another self-published
score, but it does include the copyright date and the completed date of the
composition, as noted in the 500 note &ldquo;22-7-81&rdquo;--Cover. As the date is
provided on the score, it is entered in the 260 field. This is a handwritten
score, thus the 500 note Reproduced from holograph. In addition, because
the text of the music is included on the verso of the cover this is entered as
a 500 note; and the piece is sung in English, as noted in the 546 field.
</p>
<p>The self-published handwritten score in Example 1.3 has very little
information provided on the item itself. When viewing the MARC record,
note that a few items are given in brackets. This means that the
information is estimated, or a guess, or simply is not actually stated on

<p>the item. The author in the 245 field is in brackets because it is taken from
information provided by the MACCM staff. The 260 field has [2006],
since it is just an estimate of the date the composition was completed. The
300 physical description field has [13] leaves, since the pages were not
numbered, but were counted by the cataloguer. The title was taken from
the caption area, as well as the instrumentation. The item is handwritten,
so the 500 note Reproduced from holograph is again included, as in
Example 1.2. Based on a review of the text, it is spoken in English, so the
language information is recorded in the 546 field. 
</p>
<p>In Example 1.4, the title, instrumentation and statement of
responsibility are again taken from the caption area. The date is clearly
provided in the caption area as well, and the score is written by hand
(Reproduced from holograph). The subject for this instrumentation was
somewhat interesting, due to the unusual combination of instruments.
The date recorded for the composer&rsquo;s year of birth was provided by the
MACCM staff.

<p>Summary
One thing noteworthy in all five examples is that all of the titles are
distinctive ones that do not require uniform titles. There are a number of
scores in the collection that do have uniform titles, but they are the
exception rather than the rule. Also, since this is primarily a collection of
self-published scores, no examples of commercially published scores
have been given in this chapter (these types of score are fairly well
covered in various resources).
</p>
<p>The scores have been catalogued by following the basic rules of
AACR2, with some minor variations due to some unusual and distinct
differences in publication practices and the creativity of composers from
the early 1980s onwards. Hopefully, these examples will provide some
guidance in creating score format records for those new to cataloguing
these types of score, and for others who may need to be more creative in
ways of describing scores of this nature.

<p>Popular music compact discs
</p>
<p>Introduction
As part of arguably the largest popular music collection in an academic
setting, the MLSRA&rsquo;s CD collection includes a variety of popular music
styles, including reggae, rap, rock, popular, country, jungle music, soca,
ska, filk, world beat, and emo (see Glossary for definitions), along with
many other styles. The collection also includes motion picture soundtrack
music, musicals, and spoken recordings, including comedy, poetry,
speeches, and radio shows.
</p>
<p>The MLSRA has a well-established history of cataloguing popular
sound recordings since Machine-Readable Cataloguing (MARC) records
began in the late 1970s. At that time LPs were the principal format
catalogued at BGSU; however, the MLSRA also began collecting compact
discs (CDs) when they became available in the early 1980s. The collection
has grown to more than 50,000 CDs, not including box sets. The popular
music CDs (or those housed in the Sound Recordings Archives) have
become a cataloguing priority at BGSU since summer 2007 and, at the
time of writing, are being catalogued at a rapid rate (over 11,000
catalogued in one year). With a project staff of only one full-time
cataloguer and another part-time cataloguer, numerous parts of the project
are completed by MLSRA student assistants; copy cataloguing is provided
by the library&rsquo;s technical services department.
</p>
<p>This collection provides support to various departments on campus
and is an internationally known archive. Thus, it is important that local
records are as complete as possible and to ensure that they are
customized for our users, not only local, but also those around the
world. For this reason, certain local practices are used at BGSU that
differ from those of other institutions and would not be necessary for
general cataloguing.
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>2</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Challenges
The main challenge in cataloguing this format is the assignment of subject
headings. Oftentimes no subject headings are available for newer forms of
music and something more generic needs to be used. Frequently no
information is found about the group or its style of music, even on the
internet. This also proves a challenge when creating authority records. In
addition, it can be difficult to determine the title and the performer by just
looking at the label or container.
</p>
<p>Another difficulty encountered when cataloguing CDs has been the
changes in the format itself. There are now enhanced CDs, super audio
CDs (SACD), and CDs with accompanying DVDs. There have also been
variants in the sizes of discs. In addition to the standard 4&frac34; in. discs, there
are also 3 in. discs and discs in various shapes such as footballs, shirts, and
the like. Packaging of the discs, booklets, inserts, etc. has proven to be
another challenge. These modified types of containers can be difficult to
set on the shelf with other CDs, since they are sometimes larger in size or
even have round or other shapes.
</p>
<p>This chapter will focus on the particular challenges of cataloguing
popular music CDs and the unique features used in the bibliographic
records to more effectively assist users at BGSU. The formats covered 
here include: CDs with fairly standard features, CDs by little-known
artists, compilation CDs (those with songs from multiple artists), and
promotional CDs.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing CDs at BGSU
Determining which CDs at BGSU are to be catalogued next has not been
an organized effort, but the focus at the time of writing is on regular-sized
albums, not on box sets. The CDs are searched in OCLC, processed,
catalogued, and shelved as quickly as possible. Any new CDs that have
been ordered are likewise processed as quickly as possible. The discs are
arranged by publisher number rather than accession number. Thus, all of
the Columbia, Decca, RCA Victor, etc. discs are arranged on the shelves in
alphabetical order by publisher name and then number. Most albums
contain fairly complete information by which to catalogue them, but
others require some research. There are a number of promotional
recordings in this collection, which in many cases require extra notes.

<p>Examples
</p>
<p>It is oftentimes difficult to determine, prior to cataloguing a particular
popular music CD, whether it will prove troublesome to catalogue. While
there are many challenges in the collections at BGSU, the following
examples are a select few that represent many of the challenges and
peculiarities of the popular music CDs in the MLSRA.
</p>
<p>The recording in Example 2.1 represents a fairly standard CD with the
author, title, publisher name and number, and date of publication
provided on the disc itself. The fields corresponding to these pieces of
information use standard formats, as can be seen in the example.
</p>
<p>The note fields, however, become critical with popular music CDs.
Many of the recordings in the MLSRA are not in standard format, and
therefore extra information is needed in the 500 fields to accurately
describe the item. In this example, a 511 0 note is added which describes
the types of music and the performer(s) and a 518 field includes the place
and date of recording. The 518 note is a field that is added on a regular
basis for the popular music collection because of its importance for BGSU
users and researchers: the place and time of recording can be important to
establish the recording&rsquo;s authority or authenticity, as well as for the
examination of a specific performance. The standard 500 Compact disc
note is also added, and since lyrics were included in the booklet, that note
has also been added as the last 500 note before the contents.

<p>Example 2.1 Single artist CD with lyrics in booklet (Cont&rsquo;d)
</p>
<p>While many libraries are already using the formatted 505 00 content
notes with |t for titles and |r for performers/composers, our library
currently uses the regular 505 0 non-formatted content notes field, along
with the 740 02 for separate titles. This allows our users to find individual
titles by conducting a title search rather than find them by keyword.
Keyword searches are not as useful for the popular song titles as for other
types of titles. Finally, the subject fields contain |z England, so there is a
corresponding 043 field towards the top of the record that reflects the
geographical location of England. 
</p>
<p>In the album in Example 2.2, the title and the author are one and the
same, so there is no need to add a |c author field in the 245 line. The
name/title and publisher information were found only on the container
spine, another chief source of information on CDs. The publication date
was found on the back of the container, still another source of information.
</p>
<p>A 500 note is used for the type of music, but no 518 is used, since no
recording information was provided. Again, the 500 note for Compact disc</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and another for Lyrics on insert are both included. The subject is simply
Rock music, along with the decade in which it was published. There is also
an extra 740 02 added for one of the titles: Caxton vs. the fourth estate, and
Caxton versus the fourth estate, with the word &ldquo;versus&rdquo; spelled out the
second time. This allows users to search under both versions of the title. 
</p>
<p>Example 2.3 represents a compilation album that includes multiple
artists and songs. The title found on the disc is recorded in the 245 field.
The 100/110 author field at the top is omitted because there is no single

<p>author/group performing on the album. Thus the 245 field begins with a
first indicator code of 0 (i.e. 245 04 The soul of Texas blues women). 
A 246 field has been added for the subtitle.
</p>
<p>There is a 500 note for the type of music and various performers. The
518 field reflects the overall time period of the recordings, rather than
one specific place and date, since each individual time and place would
be difficult to record in the 518 field. There is a 500 note for the
biographical notes. The performers are listed in parentheses in the 505 0
contents field, after the song titles in which they are performing. One of
the subject headings includes the |z Texas for the specific geographic
area, with a corresponding 043 field n-us-tx. Each performer is
searchable in the 700 1 field with a relator code of |4 prf to represent
performer. Again, the individual titles are searchable in the 740 02 fields. 
</p>
<p>Example 2.4 is one of the many demonstration/promotional CDs in the
collection. All of the pertinent information is provided on the disc label,
including the information that this is a demonstration album. This also
happens to be a remix album featuring one song with several versions. An
additional 500 note regarding the Demonstration-not for sale is included
before the 500 Compact disc note. Again, the lyrics are included in the
booklet and this is reflected as a 500 note. Each edit/version of the song is
listed in the 505 0, but no 740 02 is necessary since it is the same as the
245 title field. 
</p>
<p>Although the MARC record in Example 2.5 was not originally created
by BGSU, it is an example of one of the more unusual types of CDs in the
collection. No performers are listed, so there are no 100 or 700 fields. The
date 2000? is in brackets in the 260 field, as it was not listed anywhere on
the album. This is an estimated date. The publisher and title information

this information was located. There is also added information after
Compact disc about the disc&rsquo;s shape. Another 500 note is added for not
being able to play the disc in other types of player. As in the other
examples, a |z Hawaii for geographical location has been added to the 650
subject field. The corresponding 043 n-us-hi is also added. 
</p>
<p>The recording in Example 2.6 is an example of filk music (i.e. science
fiction-related topics in music format). The basic elements of author, title,
publisher, and publisher number are created as usual. The main difference
in this record is the subject matter. Subject headings have been added for
650  0 Science fiction |v Songs and music and 650  0 Fantasy fiction |v Songs
and music, since these are the topics covered in the songs. There is
currently no subject heading for filk music, so other solutions have been
found by using the two headings above. There are a number of recordings
in this genre, but many of the records in OCLC were created by BGSU as
original records.

<p>Summary
The CD examples above are just a small representation of popular music
styles catalogued at BGSU. There are other types of popular genres, and
even spoken recordings, that are not addressed here &ndash; they are too
numerous to provide examples for each and every style and format. The
main lesson to be gained from these cataloguing examples is to follow
standard cataloguing rules when possible, but to be prepared to adjust and
think outside the box when encountering something unusual. Popular
music subject headings can be difficult if the cataloguer is unfamiliar with
popular genres, but using the internet and contacting artists/managers by
e-mail can make it easier to find information about styles and artists when
reference books are not up to date on current artists.

<p>Fanzines
</p>
<p>Introduction
Fanzines, or zines as they are commonly called, are generally self-published
magazines. Many of them focus on very specific topics such as: science
fiction, mystery, motion pictures, short stories, poems, and various types
of rock music or musicians/performing groups, among others. Some zines
include reviews or interviews, while others are personal zines with no one
particular subject or focus. Zines are usually published irregularly and
have a smaller circulation than commercially published periodicals.
</p>
<p>The zines at BGSU are split into multiple collections, with the music
zines housed in the MLSRA and other, non-music zines and Diplomacy
zines (a.k.a. dipzines) housed in the BPCL in two separate collections. Until
2005, none of these zines was available in the BGSU online catalogue. The
zines in the BPCL were originally filed alphabetically and listed by title in
a 3 &times; 5 card file. The music zines were in boxes in a storage area and had
no access whatsoever.
</p>
<p>Challenges
When cataloguing these materials began, the first challenge was
determining how to catalogue them &ndash; as serials (i.e. continuing resources
in OCLC) or as books. It was determined that the serials format would
be more appropriate, as most zines are typically published as serials,
albeit irregularly. A few zines have been catalogued as books if they
appear to be unnumbered and only single issues.
</p>
<p>A second challenge is the lack of publication information and the
irregularity of publication. Oftentimes no place or date of publication is
available on the zines and there is no way to research them. The author&rsquo;s
address, if available, is often used as the place of publication. Numbering

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>sequences are sometimes non-existent or inconsistent, and publication
frequency is usually given as irregular, since most zine publishers print
zines around their own schedules, not standard publication periods.
</p>
<p>A third challenge is the assignment of subject headings. All zines in the
BPCL and MLSRA were given an LC subject heading 650 0 Fanzines
(before Zines became available as a heading). In addition to that, other
topical LC subject headings were added as appropriate. Local subject
headings were also created for different types of zine. The following are
some examples of local 690 subject fields:
</p>
<p>� Musiczines (for all zines held in the MLSRA relating to music)
</p>
<p>� Reviewzines (all zines that included reviews)
</p>
<p>� Perzines (for personal zines)
</p>
<p>� Artzines (for art-related topics)
</p>
<p>� D.I.Y.zines (for do-it-yourself zines)
</p>
<p>� Dipzines (for Diplomacy zines)
</p>
<p>� Slashzines (for underground/erotic zines).
</p>
<p>Many zines lack even one particular subject, while others cover too
many subject areas to apply all the appropriate subject headings. While
the lack of subjects/topics is prominent in many zines, it is still important
to provide some subject access rather than none.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing zines at BGSU
There were a number of factors to consider when cataloguing work began
on these collections. Unfortunately, no instructions were available to
determine how to catalogue the zines, nor any cataloguing colleagues to
ask for advice, since most zine collections in libraries remain uncatalogued.
There are articles about zines and institutions that collect them, but there
was nothing giving specific detailed cataloguing records.
</p>
<p>It thus became apparent that most zines would require original
cataloguing in OCLC, due to the lack of existing records. Some titles were
found in OCLC for copy cataloguing, but they were few and far between.
</p>
<p>Another area to be determined was placement of the author(s) of the
zine. Most commercially published magazines do not have an individual
author/editor. It was decided that for serial records the author would be
placed in the 7xx field. If the zine was catalogued in book format, the
author was placed in the 1xx field, as is standard practice for that format.
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>Cataloguing outside the box</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For most zines the author was also the publisher, so this was included in
the |b section of the 260 field as well as in the 7xx fields.
</p>
<p>As with all serials at BGSU, the zine collections in the MLSRA and
BPCL do not have any type of LC call number and are arranged
alphabetically, with numbered titles first, followed by acronyms at the
beginning of each letter of the alphabet, and then arranged by issue. Each
issue has an individual item record and barcode to keep track of in-house
usage statistics. The music zines do have a local call number field,
FANZINES, to distinguish them from other periodicals in the MLSRA.
The dipzines also have a local call number field, DIPZINES, to distinguish
them from the regular zines in the BPCL. The examples later in the chapter
will provide better insight into cataloguing these materials.
</p>
<p>The bibliographic fields for fanzines catalogued at BGSU are provided
in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. Not all serial record fields available in OCLC are
used in this format at BGSU. It is up to individual institutions to determine
which fields are appropriate for access in their particular environment.

<p>Examples
</p>
<p>Below are examples of various types of fanzine held at BGSU.
The music zine in Example 3.1, published by Jeff Rappaport, is a fairly
</p>
<p>typical zine, as it has basic information, including title, author, date of
publication, and the author&rsquo;s address. Following standard AACR2 and
OCLC fields, this record supplies the user with necessary elements to access
this zine. The subjects were applied based on the types of groups and music
described in the issues available in the MLSRA collection. Notice that the
author is listed both in the 260 |b publisher field and below in the 700 1
field as a separate author field. The local 690 fields are also added.
</p>
<p>The record in Example 3.2 has basic information in regards to author,
title, and publisher, but lacks the starting date information and frequency
of publication. The first issue held in the MLSRA is No. 112 (Aug. 8,
1981), thus the 362 field is listed with a question mark and Began in the
1970s? It is also listed in brackets in the 260 |c field, since this is just an
estimate of the starting date. The subjects reflect the fact that there are
reviews in the zine and it is basically about rock music.

<p>Example 3.3 is an example of a personal zine (or perzine), which can
cover any topic or a number of topics in each volume. Subjects vary by
person or author. The author is listed in the 260 |b field and also as a 700 1
author. The estimated date is in brackets in the 260 |c field and the 362
field reflects an estimate of the starting date, i.e. second issue, spring 1997,
as the closest issue to the first issue from which to glean information.
</p>
<p>Since this zine focuses on no one particular topic to use as a subject field,
only the 650 Fanzine and 690 Perzines were used for subject access. As a side
note, this zine does not appear to have anything to do with chicken or food.
Notice also the range of sizes in the 300 |c section. This is because BGSU
holds multiple issues of this title, in varying sizes, which is fairly typical of
fanzine publishers. There is no standard size for these types of publication.
</p>
<p>The zine in Example 3.4 has been treated as a single book, rather than a
continuing resource (or serial) publication. It is a manual for the card game
Spooneye, and therefore is limited to a single publication. Note that the
author is provided in the 100 field and 245 |c as in typical book format. The
author&rsquo;s address and name are again used as the publisher 260 |a and |b
fields. The subjects are very straightforward and require no additional local
subjects.

<p>Example 3.5 is another personal zine, but it is also about a specific place,
Japan. The authors are both listed in the 260 |b and in the 700 field as
authors. The date of issue one is clear, but the publication frequency is
Irregular. A 651 LC subject heading for Japan has been added to cover
that aspect of the zine and a local 690 Perzines has been added for personal
zines.
</p>
<p>The zine in Example 3.6 offers little in regards to publication dates and
subject topics. The title and author/publisher information are provided, but
the date can only be inferred, based on the first issue held at BGSU, No. 18
(1997). The 260 |c date is in brackets and the 362 field is listed as having
the zine start sometime in the 1990s. As for the subjects, the two local 690s
provide about as much information as possible, given that there is otherwise
no particular topic. The author is also provided in the 700 1 field. 
</p>
<p>Example 3.7 is an example of a Diplomacy zine (or dipzine), part of a
large collection of zines housed at the BPCL and donated by the Hoosier
Archives collector. These zines are related to the Diplomacy board game,
which was and is still being played by mail.

<p>Example 3.8 is an example of a slashzine (or underground/erotic zine).
Many, but not all, of these in the BPCL&rsquo;s collection are related to television
characters and explore the homosexual relationships of various characters
in a program. These zines tend to be more graphic in nature and contain
explicit sex-related stories. This particular slashzine is based on the
television program The Equalizer. Again the author, title and publication
information are similar to other examples. The date has also been provided
by the first issue in hand. Additional subject headings are provided for
Private investigators and the television program Equalizer. In addition, a
genre heading for Erotic stories and a separate 690 for Slashzines have
been added. This is a unique collection and represents yet another side of
the world of zines.</p>

<p>Summary
The challenges of cataloguing the zine collections at BGSU have been well
worth the effort, as we have had regular usage from patrons, both on-
campus and visiting researchers. Interlibrary loan requests for photocopies
of articles are on the rise for these materials. Even with the challenges of
the lack of information, lack of subjects, and the irregularity of the
publications, these collections provide a unique perspective on popular
culture, popular music, and the world of self-publishing. Hopefully, the
cataloguing of these collections at BGSU will pave the way for other
institutions to make their own zine collections accessible to patrons around
the world.

<p>Comics and graphic novels
</p>
<p>A: Comics &ndash; introduction
Comic books have been in existence since the late nineteenth century,
but did not become a mass-market production until the 1920s in Japan
and the late 1930s in America. Comic books evolved out of the comic
strips usually reproduced in newspapers and generally featured 
&ldquo;a narrative told by way of a sequence of pictures, a continuing cast of
characters from one sequence to the next, and the inclusion of dialogue
and/or text within the picture&rdquo; (Horn 1:56). Early comic stories
included topics such as mystery/detective, adventure, and romance and
were aimed more at children and juvenile audiences. The introduction
of Superman in the first issue of Action Comics in June 1938 led the way
for other superheroes to follow, particularly during the war years of
1940&ndash;45. Eventually other genres were created and expanded to appeal
more to teenagers and adults, including such areas as horror, crime,
animal and cartoon characters, fantasy, science fiction, underground/erotic,
and major world events such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Japanese
manga comics also make up a large part of the comic world. In fact,
&ldquo;Japan is the largest producer of comic books in the world ... and they
range from romance to thrillers to whimsical subjects&rdquo; (Horn 1:41).
</p>
<p>Challenges
As with the fanzines, the issue arose whether to catalogue these as serials
(continuing resources) or as books. Both formats are used, depending on
the number of issues published, usually twelve or less for book format.
There were plenty of copy cataloguing records in OCLC by the time
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>4</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>BGSU added its holdings. Michigan State University and the Library of
Congress already had many records created in OCLC. However, there
were still a large number of original titles to be catalogued, particularly
in the underground/independent comics.
</p>
<p>Once the format is determined, the next factor to consider is how
many contributors to add as authors, as there are often an author,
penciler, inker, etc. For serial records, this is not an issue. For book
formats, there is not always a simple solution. At BGSU, authors and
other contributors are added in many instances, but not all, due to the
complexity of name authority files (covered in Chapter 9).
</p>
<p>Lack of publication frequency and publisher information was another
factor in cataloguing the comic collection, particularly the underground/
independent titles. These were a bit like the fanzines when it came to
publishing and numbering and in providing publisher information. Some
regular publishers, such as DC and Marvel, also used numbers out of
sequence, or might have multiple covers of the same issue number. This
can make for complications in call number/issue number sequences. The
Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, a valuable tool in cataloguing these
materials, is often used in determining dates and issues and in verifying
information.
</p>
<p>The final area to be considered is the assignment of subject headings.
All titles at BGSU are given the generic 650  0 Comic books, strips, etc.
heading, as well as any other topic that applies. Genre headings are used
on a frequent basis, such as 655  7 Superhero comic books, strips, etc. or
Science fiction comic books, strips, etc. Specific fictitious character
names are also used where appropriate (e.g. 650  0 Batman (Fictitious
character) |v Comic books, strips, etc.). Sometimes it is not possible to
use any other topical subjects, or there may be too many topics to cover.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing comics at BGSU
The comic book collection in the BPCL houses over 50,000 comics,
ranging in date from the 1930s to the present and in varying sizes from
digest to magazine styles and larger. There are a number of independent
and underground comics in addition to mainstream titles. The collection
is arranged by LC call number sequences, which reflect an order by
publisher (i.e. DC, Marvel, etc.), title of comic, and finally by issue
number. The comics are placed in Mylar bags and then put in archival
boxes before being shelved.

<p>The following examples are a selection of comic book cataloguing from
the BPCL collection.
</p>
<p>Example 4.1 represents a typical serial comic book record. The title and
subtitle are provided, along with a separate 246 title field for the subtitle
Garden of souls. The publisher information is complete, with the open-
ended date |c 2007&ndash;, as the title has not yet ceased publication. The 300
physical description field is standard for a multiple-volume set of colored
illustrations and the size of 26 cm. is characteristic of a standard-size
comic book. The 310 frequency is Monthly and the 362 volume/date is
based on the first issue in hand. The title was found on the indicia (usually
p. 1) and the appropriate genre and LC subject headings have been added. 
</p>
<p>Example 4.2 is of a comic catalogued in book format, because there
are only four issues. The title is given in the 245 and also as an alternate
spelled title in the 246 with the &amp; written out as and. The publication
date is the year 2000, as all issues were published in one year. The 500
note (Complete in 4 nos.) has been added to establish it as a complete

<p>Summary
The comic book collection in the BPCL is a varied and growing collection,
especially since additions are made yearly by regular donors. Now that the
comic book cataloguing process is well established, it is easier to catalogue
new items as they arrive. Challenges still occasionally arise, usually regarding
a new series where little information is currently available or an issue
number falls out of the regular numbering sequence. At least, it is now easier
to find OCLC copy records for many titles, since other institutions are
adding this format to their collections. The collection at BGSU continues to
be a valuable resource for our users on campus, particularly the popular
culture and art students, as well as for outside researchers.

<p>B: Graphic novels &ndash; introduction
Graphic novels have been in existence since the mid nineteenth century.
They have not been a widely accepted form of literature in the United
States, as compared to other countries. Graphic novels combine comic-like
illustrations with the storytelling features of novels and are meant to 
be read as a single story. Some have been published in limited series
collections. The first modern graphic novel was written and illustrated
by cartoonist Will Eisner. His title, A Contract with God, was published
in 1978 and has made Eisner one of the most successful graphic novelists
(Weiner 17, 20).
</p>
<p>A few examples of modern graphic novels include the Silver Surfer,
Elfquest, the Watchmen, and the most successful United States graphic novel
series, the Sandman. Other types of graphic novels, such as the Japanese
form of manga or self-published novels, have also become very popular.
</p>
<p>The graphic novels in the BPCL continue to grow in number, as donors
give to the collection on a fairly regular basis. The titles range from
typical characters such as Batman and Spider-man, to Japanese manga
series and titles, horror titles, cartoon characters, and newer titles such
as 24 Seven, 30 Days of Night, and Captain America.
</p>
<p>Challenges
Graphic novels tend to be less challenging than some of the other print
formats in the BPCL. However, sometimes thin spines and bindings can
cause instability when shelving. At the BPCL, items are sometimes placed
in acid-free envelopes or stored in plastic cases on the shelves to help
keep them upright. Another challenge can be in not knowing how many
volumes there may be in a series, especially if donors have given only one
or two issues of an ongoing set. Multiple author fields are needed for
additional authors, inkers, pencilers, letterers, etc. and it can be time
consuming to check authority records or create new authority records
for conflicting names.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing graphic novels at BGSU
Graphic novels are catalogued using the standard book format, even
those that comprise multiple volumes. Authors, artists and others

are added, including a 650  0 field Graphic novels. LC call numbers are
assigned based on either the author or the title in the PN6726&ndash;PN6728
call number ranges. Some foreign titles are classified under other call
number ranges, depending on the authors or subject matter.
</p>

<p>(Strange visitor), but the first volume title is unknown. The -- before pt. 2
in the 505 0 contents field represents this lack of information. The 590
(local note) field has been added to give the edition number on the item
at hand from a publication of 1,000 issues. Appropriate subject headings
have been added, as usual.
</p>
<p>The record in Example 4.10 (not created originally by BGSU)
represents the manga style of graphic novels. The author and illustrator
are provided and shown in the 100 1 and 700 1 fields respectively. The
title field includes the number 17 and a subtitle, so these are also listed

with multiple volumes, so the 260 |c and 300 |a are again open ended. The
size is slightly smaller, as can be seen in the 300 |c subfield as 19 cm. 
The title and description of Graphic novel/manga Sci-fi were found on 
the cover and listed as such in separate 500 notes. The subject and
form/genre headings also include the |v Translations into English to
reflect the fact that they were originally published in Japanese.

<p>Special periodicals
</p>
<p>Before paperbacks made reading books a more accessible form of
entertainment, there were serialized stories in inexpensive formats such
as: story papers (or penny dreadfuls), nickel weeklies, dime novels, and
pulp magazines. The BPCL has a fairly large collection of these kinds of
publication, each of which has its own set of issues and challenges. This
chapter is subdivided by format, and the challenges of each are described
under the respective format.
</p>
<p>A: Story papers &ndash; introduction
Story papers represent some of the oldest materials housed in the BPCL.
Some issues date back to the mid 1860s. Story papers were newspaper-
sized publications of fiction and began around the early nineteenth
century. They were family oriented and included genres such as romances,
westerns, adventure stories, and juvenile stories for younger children. The
papers were mainly black and white publications, with illustrations usually
found on the front cover and possibly interspersed. &ldquo;Published weekly,
usually on Saturdays when people were finishing their workweeks, the
story papers soon gained enormous popularity, with the most popular
achieving a circulation of 400,000&rdquo; (DeForest 13). The papers were usually
issued in a consecutive sequence and could be mailed for very cheap postal
rates. They were known in England as &ldquo;penny dreadfuls.&rdquo;  Some story
paper titles include The Saturday Journal, Golden Argosy, The New York
Ledger, and Boys of New York.
</p>
<p>Challenges
Story papers present similar challenges to other serial publications seen
in previous chapters. There are title changes, numbering issues and
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>5</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>subject headings to be established. In addition, this format is even older
and more fragile than other formats and needs extra care when handling.
Many of the papers have been folded into half or quarto sizes and tend
to break apart at the creases. Because of the poor condition of some
issues, judgments must be made about whether it is acceptable to keep
them in the collection. It is hoped that this collection will be digitized in
the future and metadata will also be created &ndash; the condition of the
collection will have to be checked prior to that step.
</p>
<p>An additional challenge is the packaging and housing of the collection.
Some issues are bound and easy to stack on shelves. Loose issues are
placed in large archival folders, with tissue paper separating the issues,
and then put into acid-free boxes. They are arranged alphabetically, then
chronologically. There are no markings or labels on the issues. Instead,
rolodex cards with individual titles and barcodes are used to count usage
of the collection.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing story papers at BGSU
Story papers are catalogued as serial records in OCLC. Like other serial
formats, there are some copy records in OCLC, but most require updates
to meet current standards and subject headings and/or form/genre terms.
There is no specific reference book to assist in gathering information
about issues and titles of story papers. Much of the information is
estimated, based on issues at hand. The fixed and variable fields of the
bibliographic record are presented in Tables 5.1 and 5.2, followed by
cataloguing examples.

<p>Examples
</p>
<p>Example 5.1 shows a record with a straightforward title and complete
publisher information, but lacking the starting date of the publication.
Based on the issue at hand (vol. 5, no. 6), the date in the 260 |c field has
been estimated at starting sometime in the 1880s. The ending date has
been provided as vol. 49, no. 1 in May 1933 in the 362 field. Since this
is a serial record, the 300 (physical description) includes v. for a multi-
volume set. The frequency has been listed as Monthly in the 310 field.
Subject headings have been added and a 785 04 has been included for
the title continuation to Good stories.

<p>Example 5.2 illustrates a number of cataloguing issues. The title and
subtitles are given in the 245 and 247 fields, but also note the title
variations in the 580 linking entry complexity note (a way to show the
connection between this title and the others). The title changes are
provided here and also shown in the 780 (absorbed by) and 785
(continued by) fields. There is also a separate 500 note stating the
variations in subtitles and caption titles.
</p>
<p>The 260 publication field includes standard fields with the |c subfield in
brackets, since the dates are estimated. The 300 physical description field
establishes this as a multi-volume series, with some illustrations, and 
44 cm in height. The 505 0 contents field has been added for local
information about specific issues held at BGSU. Subjects have been added,
including geographic headings for the United States and New York. 
</p>
<p>Example 5.3 also shows some variety in cataloguing fields. The first
major difference can be found in the 130 (uniform title) field. This places
the title with like titles, with the added qualifier for the place and date in
parentheses. The 245 and 260 fields are completed as usual, with the
added brackets around N.Y. in the |a section, since it is assumed and not
provided on the publication itself. The 300 field includes a range of sizes
for the |c field, indicating that the size varies among issues. The 310
frequency field is listed as Weekly and two 362 fields are provided. The
first one describes the beginning volume and date information as found
on that item by the cataloguing institution. The second 362 field
contains the ending date information found in the Oct. 2, 1847 issue of
a story paper with the same title, as seen in the |z Cf. statement. The Cf.
is Latin for &ldquo;confer&rdquo; or &ldquo;bring together and compare.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>General 500 notes have been added for the editors and for the quote
found on issues of the story papers. Again, a 505 0 contents field has
been added for local holdings. The 525 field is a supplement note and the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>580 fields again link to the other versions of this story paper. These are
also provided in the 775 fields for other titles. The subjects have been
added for New York and New York County along with the |v Newspapers.
The 752 (hierarchical place name) field has also been added to show the
hierarchy of location.

<p>Example 5.4 represents a fairly simple record for a story paper. The
title and publisher information are provided, although the Pa. and |c date
are in brackets since the information is assumed. This is a weekly
publication, as noted in the 310 frequency field and Began in 1868 is
based on the source used in the 362 field (A Checklist of Pennsylvania
newspapers). A 500 note is also added to describe which issue was used
to obtain bibliographic information. BGSU has again added a 505 0
contents note for local holdings. The subject headings are also included,
along with a 752 hierarchical place field.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Summary
Although these story paper bibliographic records were not originally
created by BGSU, they can present challenges for all who catalogue
serials. Some of the biggest challenges can be the title and publisher
variations, establishing beginning and ending dates, creating subject
headings, and lack of sources to verify information. Serials cataloguing
can be done at various levels of access, depending on the institution and
the type of material. As an older and more fragile format, the story papers
in the BPCL have been an interesting one to catalogue. It is hoped that
eventually digitizing the collection will make it more accessible to others.

<p>B: Nickel weeklies &ndash; introduction
Nickel weeklies were offshoots of the dime novel format from the late
nineteenth century. The nickel weeklies format of a 13&frac14; &times; 9 in., 32-page,
black and white illustrated cover was introduced in 1873 by the
publisher Beadle &amp; Adams (Johannsen 1: 169). The title was New and
Old Friends and the price began at 10 cents, but eventually dropped to
5 cents as other publishers like Street &amp; Smith and Frank Tousey also
became involved in publishing nickel weeklies. Muted colors for covers
were introduced in the late 1890s and subjects included mysteries,
western, urban crime, and adventure stories. Some stories became serials
and would be continued in various issues. Titles included Pluck and
Luck, the Liberty Boys of &rsquo;76, Tip Top Weekly, Work &amp; Win, among
others. Nickel weeklies continued into the 1920s, but were eventually
succeeded by the pulp magazine format. BGSU holdings include nearly
2,000 issues of nickel weeklies.
</p>
<p>Since this collection is fairly large and contains a variety of titles, some
unique, and the majority of it is in the public domain, in early 2007 BGSU
decided to digitize each appropriate issue. Later that year, metadata
assignation began, much discussion about metadata having taken place
beforehand. Cataloguing practices and challenges inherent in cataloguing
these types of resources are dispersed throughout this chapter.

<p>changes, errors in number sequences, and assignment of subject headings
to a multi-volume series were some of the main difficulties.
</p>
<p>The condition of the nickel weeklies caused problems in cataloguing
and scanning for digitization, primarily because the fragility of the paper
made it difficult to handle or scan properly at times.
</p>
<p>Individual issues of nickel weeklies have their own challenges. Because
of the condition of some issues, it can be difficult to read text,
particularly on the cover, which is frequently in worse condition than the
rest of the issue. Most of the pertinent issue information is located on the
front cover in most titles. In addition, there is no comprehensive index
to this type of periodical, so it is difficult to find synopses of the stories
in order to assign subject headings. It is therefore necessary to read
through or to browse each issue to get a sense of what the main story is
about. This is very time consuming.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing nickel weeklies at BGSU
Nickel weeklies have been catalogued using serial records in OCLC.
Each title is catalogued and exported into the BGSU Libraries catalogue,
and each issue of a title is added individually to the bibliographic record
with its own barcode. Each issue is placed in an acid-free manila folder
with the title and issue number written in pencil at the top of the folder
and the barcode on the front of the folder. The folders are filed
alphabetically and chronologically in acid-free boxes, and then shelved.
</p>
<p>There was no specific reference tool to assist in cataloguing the nickel
weeklies. Many starting and ending dates are therefore estimated, based
on volumes in hand at the time of cataloguing. As for other serial
formats from this period, there were bibliographic records in OCLC for
most titles, but many were lacking subjects, complete date information,
or publication data. Again, fields were added and updated to meet
current cataloguing standards. An additional subject heading of 650  0
Dime novels |v Periodicals was added to each record to provide
additional searching capabilities.
</p>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>Examples are provided below; however, none has been originally created
by BGSU. For all except Example 5.5 no title and publication
information are presented before the MARC record, since most

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>information for nickel weeklies is on the cover and occasionally on the
first page.
</p>
<p>The record in Example 5.5 includes a title and subtitle, as shown in the
245 field. The 260 publication field includes the place of publication and
publisher as noted in the indicia. However, the |c date field is in brackets
with the last two digits missing. This means that the starting date is
estimated as sometime in the nineteenth century, probably in the late
century, since the issue in hand was no. 110 from 1900, as recorded in
the 500 note. The 300 physical description field is typical for a serial
record, with v. : ill. ; 28 cm. The 310 frequency field is listed as Weekly
and a 500 note contains the information about distinctive titles for
individual issues. Other 500 notes are included for publisher variations,

<p>The serial in Example 5.8 represents a record with a title and subtitle,

<p>Using metadata to catalogue individual
issues of nickel weeklies
The digitized nickel weekly collection at the BPCL is slowly becoming
part of the OhioLINK Digital Resource Commons (DRC), Ohio&rsquo;s
comprehensive digital repository. However, before any issues were
entered, there was much discussion about which fields to use to describe
each issue. The DRC uses a modified Dublin Core metadata schema (see
Example 5.10b for many of the fields), which made decisions a bit easier.
Discussions included: how much information should be included in these
records, what information would be the most useful, which stories
should be assigned specific metadata, and which could be mentioned in
the descriptive notes.
</p>
<p>The digitization has been completed, but assigning of metadata
continues. As the metadata is completed the issues are batch uploaded
into the DRC (http://drc.ohiolink.edu/). The most pertinent fields are
outlined in Example 5.10a.
</p>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>Example 5.10a reflects the &ldquo;simple item record&rdquo; format that this particular
collection uses in the DRC as its default display. These fields are considered
to be the most useful for users of the collection and were formatted
specifically for the BPCL Nickel Weekly Collection. The software used for
the DRC is DSpace and it allowed customization of the simple item record
screen, unlike the full item record screen (Example 5.10b). As far as
representing the item, this &ldquo;simple&rdquo; format is fairly complete.
</p>
<p>Most nickel weekly issues have two titles for the story inside, which
are labeled here as Title and Alternative Title. This issue has no alternate
title. Most nickel weeklies have an author; in fact, it is not uncommon
for one author only to write for a particular series or about a particular
character. Date of the issue and its volume and issue number occupy the

<p>next two fields. The Description field describes the issue itself, and
records also if there are any other items of interest (e.g. additional
serialized stories) within the issue.
</p>
<p>Each issue is assigned subject headings for the main story only, using
Library of Congress subject headings. This issue has Coverage Temporal
assigned as 19th century, which is not a Library of Congress subject
heading but is consistent within this collection. Library of Congress
headings are used whenever possible. The final fields are the language of
the item and its persistent URI.
</p>
<p>Example 5.10b is the &ldquo;full item record&rdquo;, which uses a modified Dublin
Core metadata schema. As is evident, this format is difficult to read,
which is why it is not the default display. Some fields in this format are
not reflected in the default display, but they are there, should anyone
have an interest in them.
</p>
<p>The metadata for the DRC can be entered two ways: directly into the
DRC via a customized input form, or by batch upload from an xml file.

<p>The digitized nickel weeklies present some challenges, such as: pdf files
that are difficult to read because the original items are damaged in some
way; difficulties in reading the dates or other text because the original
text is too small; no synopsis to review in order to assign subject
headings, which means the cataloguer has to read through portions of
these items in order to determine one subject or several.
</p>
<p>Summary
The nickel weeklies represent a unique format of dime novel publication
from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. While the serial
cataloguing records are somewhat limited in giving complete details of
individual stories, the metadata records will provide more access to
images and specific stories. Overall, this format presented minimal
challenges as compared to others in the BPCL collections. This rich
collection of records will be helpful to researchers interested in dime
novel literature.

<p>C: Pulp magazines &ndash; introduction
Pulp magazines make up a large portion of the special collections within
the BPCL. This collection of periodicals contains stories from various
topics including: science fiction, detective and mystery, love stories, sea
stories, adventure stories, and westerns. As a successor to the penny
dreadfuls and dime novels of the nineteenth century, pulp magazines first
appeared in 1896, with Argosy being the first title made of pulp-wood
paper, with a size of 10 &times; 7 in. Pulps continued into the mid twentieth
century, with cover art that was often considered lurid and dramatic in
order to appeal to consumers of the time. Active in the production of
pulps were numerous authors and illustrators, such as: Ray Bradbury,
H.P. Lovecraft, Max Brand and Raymond Chandler, Rudolph Belarkski,
Earle K. Bergey, N.C. Wyeth, and J. Allen St. John.
</p>
<p>The pulp collection at BGSU has been growing and developing since
the late 1960s. Donors continue to help fill gaps in holdings by sending
donations on a regular basis. The BPCL currently holds more than
15,000 issues of pulps, which are separated into two collections: one
general collection from several different donors, and one named
collection from a single donor.
</p>
<p>Challenges
Pulps are similar to other serial publications in regards to the challenges
they present. Like other serials, there can be title changes, publisher and
place of publication changes, lack of numbering sequences, lack of dates,
errors in numbering sequences, and difficulties in assigning subject
headings to a multi-volume serial.
</p>
<p>Another challenge in working with pulps is their condition. Many
have been stored in a variety of places before being donated to the library
(e.g. basements, warehouses, other storage facilities). The musty smell,
flaky and sometimes torn papers, and the general fragility of this
particular format make it difficult to work with.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing pulps at BGSU
Since the pulps are a serial format, they have been catalogued using serial
records. Each title is catalogued and exported into the BGSU online

<p>Many records were found in OCLC, but were lacking subject fields,
complete date information, or publication information. Fields were
updated to meet current standards and subject headings and form/genre
terms were added, as well as the LC subject &ldquo;Pulp literature&rdquo; as a way to
search all of the pulps more easily. Tables 5.3 and 5.4 show the standard

<p>Example 5.11 shows a title field (245) that contains a number in the title.
A 246 field has been added with the number 10 spelled out so that it is

<p>Summary
The pulp collections in the BPCL comprise a large part of American
fiction stories from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The
wide range of topics and cover art appealed to readers of all ages. The
few challenges encountered in cataloguing this format have been well
worth the effort, as the BPCL continues to receive requests for articles
found in the pulp collection. Visiting researchers seem to find a wealth
of material here as well.

</p>
<p>Introduction
One of the BPCL&rsquo;s strengths is its popular fiction collections and
materials. A majority of the collection covers the romance and mystery
genres, with science fiction/fantasy and western/adventure fiction not far
behind. These genres cover a number of different &ldquo;formats&rdquo; such as:
vintage paperbacks, pulp magazines and nickel weeklies (covered in
Chapter 5 on special periodicals), and the mass-market hardbound and
paperback fiction.
</p>
<p>This chapter uses AACR2, MARC/MARC21, as appropriate, and is
organized by cataloguing &ldquo;issue&rdquo; or &ldquo;challenge&rdquo;. The &ldquo;formats&rdquo; covered
here are mass-market hardbound and paperback books as well as vintage
paperbacks.
</p>
<p>Challenges
Cataloguing fiction sounds like it would be fairly easy, but that is not
always true. As has been mentioned in earlier chapters, the BPCL materials
are only browsable by the library staff, so the cataloguing records need to
be research-level records (as complete and accurate as possible). Many
challenges arise when cataloguing the kinds of fiction that the BPCL
collects: from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Different
printings from different publishers, changes in title, author pseudonyms,
various series, rereleases from a series to a mass-market release,
translations of works &ndash; all of these can make fiction cataloguing difficult.
In addition, assigning call numbers and subject and genre headings is
sometimes difficult. A final challenge is enhancing older cataloguing
records in order to ensure that they are correct and complete, and that it
is obvious to all which edition or printing of a work is being viewed.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A: Cataloguing popular fiction at BGSU
Naturally, the basic book format is used for fiction at BGSU (except for
that in the pulp magazines and nickel weeklies). There are not too many
surprises, but it is imperative that the records are complete and accurate,
given the number of editions or printings that may be represented in 
the BPCL. Oftentimes researchers want to view only particular editions
of a work and not others, so the BPCL records must reflect exactly what
is in the collection. In the past, some records have been found to not
accurately reflect the collections, and the BPCL cataloguers are dedicated
to rectifying those errors.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>This chapter contains several examples of different challenges illustrated
in records from the BPCL. It should be noted that although some of these
records are not original to BGSU, they do illustrate the issues being
discussed.
</p>
<p>Example 6.1 is a fairly straightforward book record; it has one simple
title and one author, evident in the 245. The author&rsquo;s name is in the 
100 field, with the publication information in the 260. Generally, 
the publisher&rsquo;s name is shortened for well-known publishers, indicated in
the 260 with just |b Dell instead of Dell Publishing (seen in the table
above the MARC record). The 300 field has no surprises, just the page
number and the size of the book, which, for paperbacks, is usually 18
cm. There is a 500 note for the phrase &ldquo;Dell Contemporary Romance&rdquo;
on the spine, which could also be used as a series. This is enough to trace
it a bit if someone wanted to find other Dell Contemporary Romances.
It is usually findable using a keyword search in a library catalogue. There
is a genre heading of Love stories, which is typically used for romance
novels, both stand-alone and series titles. This is a field that can also be
traced in many types of library catalogues. Additionally, the 020 field can
be filled in using the ISBN and price of the book given on the spine (or
sometimes on the back cover).
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been mentioned before in this book that many examples shown
here reflect previous cataloguing practices &ndash; and this record is no
different. No subject headings were assigned to this record, but there
could have been, given that the book contains a synopsis on the back
cover.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Donor relations &ndash; manuscript collection
donors
As has already been mentioned, much of the BPCL&rsquo;s collection consists
of donated materials. A fair amount of these materials are books and
manuscripts donated by authors. Often, as part of the legal agreement
between the BPCL and the author/donor, the BPCL must keep every copy
that it is given of the author&rsquo;s works. Thus, there are many versions of
these works, including in other languages or from publishers outside the
U.S. For example, an author who writes for Harlequin may donate a
work published by Harlequin in the U.S., and also editions published in
Italy or Australia. Frequently, the donated books published by Harlequin

<p>are series romances, which have a numbering system under which they
are catalogued. Series romances published outside the U.S. have different
numbering systems, which necessitate new call numbers for a particular
series, or even trying to fit the items into the current call number
sequence. This issue will be covered in more detail later in the chapter.
</p>
<p>Users can find it useful to study various editions of a particular title,
especially if they can view an author&rsquo;s body works or a range of book
covers. Cover illustrations can reflect the time in which the book was
written or provide evidence of a trend in the publishing or marketing of
books. For example, one might study how women herring fishers are
represented on the covers of romance novels (Liffen 349).
</p>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>Susan Elizabeth Phillips, a manuscript donor, has donated many different
editions of a book entitled Fancy pants, which are represented in
Examples 6.2a to 6.2d. These examples again support the assertion that,
for the MLSRA and the BPCL, MARC records must be as accurate and
complete as possible. When cataloguing these types of book, a single
edition is simple to catalogue, but when there are several editions of the
same work, cataloguing them alongside one another can become a
challenge. The following records illustrate the above issues.
</p>
<p>The record for Example 6.2a looks fairly typical of a book record.
From the information in the table, data can be entered into the 100 and
245 fields easily, as well as into the 260 and 300 fields. Another
important field to be aware of for book records is the 250, the edition
field. Information in this field is important for those looking for
particular editions of works. Since this book is an advance reading copy,
it is correct to note this in the 250. The brackets indicate that the
information was found not on the title page or verso, but elsewhere on
the book. The first 500 field indicates that the information was found on
the cover. Advance reading copies are not typically catalogued in the
BPCL, but are included in a donor author&rsquo;s manuscript collection. This
particular copy was catalogued a number of years ago and thus reflects
an earlier cataloguing practice. Advance reading copies, sometimes
called galley proofs, are usually not quite ready for release. They may be
sent to particular readers or reviewers for initial review of the text, or to
bookstores for review. They do not always have a finished cover, though
this particular copy does, and they may contain typos that would be
noticed and reported by the advance readers.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The second two 5xx fields record a Pocket Books book number as
well as the fact that this is part of a named collection, even though it is
not part of this author&rsquo;s manuscript collection.
</p>
<p>The record contains no genre or subject headings, which again reflects
earlier practices, so it could be enhanced by the addition of these fields.
</p>
<p>The MARC record in Example 6.2b is very brief, containing only basic
information about the book, though it does have a genre heading (Love
stories) to give it some subject relevance. When cataloguing numerous
editions of the same work, it is a must to keep the author and title fields
the same, since these fields link the records together. This was the first
printing of this work, so there is no need to have a 250 field. To enhance
the record, a 500 note could indicate the printing date. The 300 field is
the same as in Example 6.2a, as is the 260 field. In Example 6.2b, the
020 field contains the ISBN and price of the book. In Example 6.2a, the
price is not available, since the item is an advance copy, but it does have
an ISBN.

<p>When cataloguing works in another language one must be careful,
particularly if it is not a language with which the cataloguer is familiar.
Romanized languages, unlike those that use symbols (e.g. Korean) or
Cyrillic characters (e.g. Russian), can be &ldquo;figured out&rdquo; enough to fill 
in a basic record. The record in Example 6.2c is the Swedish version 
of Fancy pants, which is indicated in the 240 10 (uniform title). The
original title is entered first, followed by a |l and the language of the
book. The 245 is always the title from the title page of the item. The rest
of the 245 for this item shows the author in the |c and, after that, what
is believed to be the translator.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the place of publication is not listed on the title page
with the publisher, nor on the verso of the title page, so the place of
publication is in brackets, indicating that it is found elsewhere, as is the
date. The 300 field is fairly simple and the 700 field is the tracing of the
translator&rsquo;s name.
</p>
<p>This record could be enhanced by the addition of genre and subject
headings, as there is a synopsis of the book on the back cover, but one</p>

<p>would need to look at one of the English versions, unless one were able

</p>
<p>BPCL cataloguers are careful to use the same subject headings for
different editions of a work. Older catalogue records, when found to
have missing genre and subject headings, are enhanced to include these
and to match like records.
</p>
<p>The record for the German edition, Example 6.2d, is of course similar
to the others, with a few differences. This record has a 240 10 with the
uniform title and the |l with German as the language of the item. This
item, however, has a slightly different title, as is evident in the 245. The
rest of the 245 contains the author&rsquo;s name as well as what is believed 
to be the translator. Notice, in the table, that there is a phrase on the 
title page verso stating that this book&rsquo;s original title is Fancy pants, and
that is recorded in the 546. In the 260 is the publisher and place of

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Example 6.3a describes the oldest version that the BPCL holds of this
work. The record is fairly straightforward. There is no 020 field, since
there were no ISBNs in 1905. The 100 contains the official form of the
author&rsquo;s name and his birth and death dates. The 245 has the title, which
contains a subtitle in the |b, with the author&rsquo;s name in the |c. The 260
contains the publisher, place of publication and the date, none of which
have brackets, since all of this information is on the title page. The 300
has the page numbers and the size (20 cm. is fairly standard for books of
this period), as well as a |b, which contains illus., indicating illustrations
in this work (which now would be abbreviated as ill.).
</p>
<p>The record for Example 6.3b, the second oldest version that the BPCL
holds, has very few surprises. The 100 field is again the authority file
name (more on that in Chapter 9) and the 245 field looks exactly like
that for the 1905 edition. The 260 has a different publisher and place of
publication. Notice in the 008 the enk abbreviation in the fixed field

<p>Example 6.3c Book with very old and newer editions: 1977 edition</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It should be noted that not all of the current punctuation standards are
included in this record.
</p>
<p>The version in Example 6.3c is clearly a reprint, since the publication
year is 1977, many years after the original edition. This version has an
020 field, unlike the earlier editions, which had no ISBNs. Further
changes are reflected in the 245, which adds a statement about the new
introduction and who wrote it. The brackets around that statement,
however, make it obvious that this information did not come from the
title page or verso. The 260 is fairly straightforward. However, the 300
has some extra information in it. Rules mandate that Roman numerals
are placed before Arabic numerals when noting pagination. Typically, in
fiction monographs, when Roman numerals are present at the beginning
of the book they contain an introduction or some type of introductory
material prior to the main text. Then, following that is ill. in the |b,
indicating that there are illustrations in this work and, finally, the size,
which is slightly larger than the other two editions of this work.
</p>
<p>Notice, also, that this book is apparently part of a series, which is
traceable with the 490 tag. This tag is usually formatted as shown, with
the series title first in the field, then followed by a semi-colon and a |v
with the volume or part number, if available.
</p>
<p>The following two 5xx fields are similar to Example 6.3b, as is the
655  7 field. Again, this record could be enhanced by adding subject
headings and a 700 1 field to trace the author of the introduction. It is
currently standard practice in the BPCL to assign 7xx fields to all
individuals mentioned in the 245.
</p>
<p>The record in Example 6.3d begins much like the others, with the
ISBN for this edition in the 020 and the author&rsquo;s name in the 100 field.
The 245 is the same as the earlier editions, except that, finally, the
illustrator is acknowledged, both here and in a 700 field. The 260 and
300 fields hold no surprises. The first 500 is the same, but there is an
additional 500 field that states that this is a reprint of the 1904&ndash;1905
Ward, Lock edition (which is not the same as the 1905 edition in
Example 6.3a). This record also includes a summary of the work, which
is a nice addition. This is part of a named collection and has a few
assigned subject headings, another pleasant addition. A slightly different
genre heading is assigned in the 655.
</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the differences in cataloguing practices
throughout the BPCL&rsquo;s history. Future projects could include ensuring
consistency among like records.

<p>Tracing characters
Many of the BPCL&rsquo;s resources relate to each other a great deal, given the
kinds of large donated collections and other resources that have been
collected in the popular fiction collections. With some of the popular
entertainment collections, related items are traced via a 730 field or a
240 uniform tag. Of course, items can be traced with the 100 or 700
fields. An example of another way to trace related items is assigning
particular subject headings, and &ndash; particular to the BPCL &ndash; related
materials by fictional character. If a subject heading for the character
does not exist, assign subject headings based on the occupations or other
characteristics of the main characters, such as: Cowboys, Single fathers,
Private investigators, and many others.
</p>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>In named collections, there are frequently many different editions and
printings of a work which may also include a change in the title. In
addition, named collections include books that feature one character
from one book to the next, even though these books may not form part
of a named series. Examples 6.4a to 6.4e illustrate changes in title and
tracing materials by character.
</p>
<p>The item in Example 6.4a is part of the Gary C. Hoppenstand
Adventure Fiction Collection, which is one of the larger named
collections of fiction in the BPCL. A good portion of the books in this
collection are parts of series or are installments in the adventures of 
one character or another &ndash; in these examples Harry Paget Flashman. 
Mr. Flashman has his own assigned subject heading, noted in the 650
field, with the words Fictitious character in parentheses next to the
name. Many books in the BPCL feature characters that continue to
appear in story after story. This issue was first addressed in Chapter 4,
on comics and graphic novels. Putting recurring characters in subject
heading fields helps to link like items, as is evident in the remaining
examples.
</p>
<p>The rest of this record is fairly straightforward. There are no real
surprises in the 100 and 245 fields. This particular record uses the 250
field to reflect that this book is the first American edition. In the 260,
much of the record is standard, except for the second |b, which includes
the book distributor. It is featured prominently in the item, so the
cataloguer felt it was necessary to acknowledge it in the record.

<p>There are two 5xx fields, of which one is a local note to signify that

<p>in the 300 field. Notice also that the fixed fields use both dates with an
r in the DtSt field, which indicates a Reprint/Original date.
</p>
<p>This record also appears to include an expanded title, as compared to
the previous example (the 1982 edition), which is placed in a |b as a
subtitle. Additionally, George MacDonald Fraser is apparently the
editor/arranger rather than the author, as he appears to be in Example
6.4a. Still, his name is listed in the 100 field as the individual principally
responsible for the content of this book.
</p>
<p>In the 300 field, notice in the |b the word maps. Typically, when this
is used there are maps on the inside covers or somewhere at the
beginning of the book. Additionally, in the fixed fields under Ills, there
needs to be a b to indicate maps in the item. This item includes
bibliographical references in the 504 as well, and also includes the page
numbers for them. This is also part of a named collection (590 field), is
about Mr. Flashman (650  0), and represents two genres &ndash; Historical
fiction and Adventure fiction. This record, too, could be enhanced by
additional subject headings.
</p>
<p>The record for Example 6.4c looks very much like the previous ones,
though possibly not as complete. Notice the Example 6.4c main table
with the book information, and then notice the MARC record. The 020
fields are populated by the ISBNs from the verso of the title page and
from the back cover, and by the price from the back cover. The 100 is 
the same, and the 245 is similar to the first two examples. The only
difference is the range of years from the Flashman papers. The 260 field
pulls information from the title page and the verso and the 300 has no
surprises. This book again contains bibliographical references, with page
numbers, as the 504 reflects. A local note establishes that this book is
part of a named collection. The one subject heading that links this record
with the others is the Fictitious character heading with the main
character&rsquo;s name. The record finishes with a genre heading. This record
could be enhanced by adding more subject headings.
</p>
<p>In Example 6.4d there are only a few differences from the previous
three examples. This record uses a 250 to acknowledge that this is the
first American edition. Also, in the 260, the distributor is recognized.
This record also has an additional genre heading.
</p>
<p>Notice that the record in Example 6.4e is much newer than the others,
and note also that it is more complete. It uses the 020, the 250, and an
additional subject heading (651), reflecting that this story takes place in
Great Britain between 1837 and 1901. Because this record uses a 651 to
denote a place for a subject heading, there also has to be a 043 with the
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>Popular fiction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>abbreviation for the country and section of that country. Since 
the subject heading is Great Britain, but not a particular part of Great
Britain, the 043 includes simply an e and a uk to denote that 
Great Britain is in Europe, but nothing after that to denote a part of 
that country. There is also a genre heading for Historical fiction.

<p>Books in series
Many of the books in the BPCL are parts of series, particularly in the
romance genre, from such publishers as Harlequin, Silhouette, and
others. These series titles include: Harlequin romance, Harlequin&rsquo;s
collections, Silhouette romance, Silhouette intimate moments, Harlequin
intrigue, Candlelight regency romances, Loveswept, and many others.
They use the same basic call number, PN6071.L7, and are given cutter
numbers reflecting the particular series title.
</p>
<p>In addition to the adventure fiction, the BPCL also has series in the
science fiction genre. Some of these series titles or characters include:
Perry Rhodan, Doc Savage, The Avengers, Tarzan, and many others.
Most of these series, unlike those in the series romances, have their own

<p>call number rather than the PN6071 area. The science fiction/fantasy
series are typically not as large as the series romance titles and tend to
focus on one character, unlike the series romances.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing these series is not always very difficult, since they are part
of a series and the call number for the series is usually already
established, but they can sometimes be a little different, as some of the
following examples will show.
</p>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>Within the romance collections in the BPCL, there are many series
romances that have smaller series within them, one of which is illustrated
in Examples 6.5a and 6.5b. The two books in the examples are by the
same author in The seekers series. Occasionally, series within a series have
different authors, but a majority of the books will have the same author.
The record in Example 6.5a is very similar to that in Example 6.5b, but
with a few differences. The author signed this book, which is reflected
here in a 590 (local note) field rather than in a 500, which is actually the
preferred practice. The record in Example 6.5a also uses the Love stories
genre heading, but no others. This record should be enhanced to match
the others in this series, and could benefit from subject headings as well.
</p>
<p>Within the Harlequin romance series (one of the oldest series in the BPCL)
there are a number of titles that are different printings of the same title and
that have different numbers assigned to them. Many of the Harlequin
romances were previously published by Mills &amp; Boon, London, and then
were published in North America in early years by Harlequin in Winnipeg,
Ontario before being published in Toronto, Ontario in later years. Some of
the Harlequin romances in the BPCL&rsquo;s collection were published in the U.S.
</p>
<p>These two examples are part of a donation by one of the BPCL&rsquo;s
manuscript donors. The author has signed them, as is reflected in a 500
note in Example 6.5b. Note the 090 field with the general call number,
PN071.L7 for the series romances, with the cutter H34, which denotes the
Harlequin intrigue series. The 100 and 245 fields are standard, but take a
look at the 260 field. Because the main place of publication is Toronto,
which is not in the U.S., there needs to be a second |a for the city in the
U.S., which happens to be New York. The 440 field reflects the series title,
with the main series as the first 440. The series statement is now reflected
in a 490 field, but this record was created before that rule was enacted. The
|v in the 440 holds the number on the book in this series. The second 440
indicates that there is another series to which this book belongs: a series
within a series. Many of the series romances, particularly the newer titles,
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>Popular fiction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>have smaller series within the larger series. All of the books in the romance
genre in the BPCL have the genre heading of Love stories. The Harlequin
intrigue series generally uses the Romantic suspense fiction and/or
Suspense fiction genre headings as well. In addition, this record could be
further enhanced by the use of subject headings.

<p>In many cases, the BPCL must contend with having the same story,
two different times, in the same series, as is illustrated in Examples 6.6a

cataloguing practices. At first glance, it could be enhanced by subject and

<p>this record uses the 1966 date only, since this is a new edition published
by Harlequin rather than by Mills &amp; Boon. In the 260, Harlequin could
have been abbreviated, but using Harlequin Books is fine. The 440  0
would now be a 490 0. A 500 note could be included to acknowledge the
fact that Mills &amp; Boon previously published this book.
</p>
<p>Example 6.6b indicates that this is the Harlequin U.S. edition (in the
250), but still has Winnipeg in the first |a. This record also includes a 020,
since there is an ISBN for this later printing, and acknowledges the original
publication from Mills &amp; Boon. Notice, however, the number in the |v area
in the 440, which has 52991, rather than a three-digit number as the rest
of the titles have. Harlequin reissued a number of their titles using a five-
digit numbering sequence rather than continuing the three-digit sequence.
The last three numbers are the same as the original Harlequin printing, but
a 50-, 51-, or 52- have been added to the numbers on these reissued titles.

<p>titles is something that the BPCL needs to deal with eventually. For
example, should a 240 be used along with a 245, or should a 245 and a
246 be used to acknowledge the original title? Could the records simply
contain a 500 note that reflects the original title? Most likely, any of
these options is correct, but whatever practice is used needs to be
consistent throughout this type of record. Genre and subject headings
complete the record in Example 6.7a.

<p>librarian, Example 6.7b states that it was first published under Jan
Marlowe, hospital librarian. Therein lies the problem: which is the
original title, or which title should be the uniform title, if that is 
the practice used? This record also has a 500 note that acknowledges the
original title, but does not use either a 240 or 246, although the BPCL
currently uses these, albeit inconsistently, for this type of record. Subject
and genre headings complete the record.

<p>Summary
Cataloguing popular fiction is not typically difficult, but issues arise that
make it an occasional challenge. The key is to adhere to standards as
much as possible and to have consistent cataloguing policies in place to
deal with issues such as those covered in this section of the chapter.

<p>B: Vintage paperback collection &ndash;
introduction
The vintage paperback collection, the BPCL&rsquo;s largest series, contains mass-
market paperbacks published from the 1930s to around 1963, before
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) were used. The collection
includes such topics as science fiction, mysteries, Greek tragedy, westerns,
history, and many other subject areas, both fiction and non-fiction. Though
the majority of the BPCL vintage paperbacks are fiction, some non-fiction
examples have been used in the chapter to illustrate particular cataloguing
issues. The collection is arranged in LC series call numbers, arranged by
publisher and publisher series number. Some of the publishers in this
collection include Ace Books, Bantam, Dell, Pocket, Pyramid, and others.
</p>
<p>Authors and the stories they published in this vintage paperback era
were an important part of the history of mass-market publications.
Another part of this history, however, was the cover art, and the
illustrators who made these books more attractive and appealing to
consumers during this period. For the collection at BGSU, the illustrator

<p>has been added to the bibliographic record if noted in the book itself.
Some of the major authors featured in this collection include Edgar Rice
Burroughs, J.R.R. Tolkien, Isaac Asimov, and Fritz Leiber. Some major
illustrators featured in the collection include Gerald Gregg, Walter
Brooks, Lawrence Camp, Victor Kalin, and Josh Kirby, to name a few.
</p>
<p>Challenges
The main issue which causes some complication in cataloguing these
paperbacks is the printing version and other publishing dates that appear
on the verso of the title page. This can make it difficult to determine the
correct publishing date.
</p>
<p>Another challenge is the numbering sequence provided by the
publishers. Sometimes the same number is used in a series for two
different books, or, as in the Ace Books, two are books published in one
volume as an Ace Double. A decision must be made whether to catalogue
the titles separately or on one bibliographic record.
</p>
<p>The final challenge is the authority work. While many authors have
existing authority records, there are a number that still need to be
created. It can also be difficult to locate information about illustrators.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing vintage paperbacks at BGSU
Cataloguing of the Vintage Paperback Collection was begun in the 1990s
by staff in the Technical Services Cataloguing Department. The LC call
number PN1 was established for the collection, since it was not used for
classification of periodicals at BGSU. Publisher cutter numbers were
established following basic cutter rules, such as .A23 for Ace Books, .B35
for Bantam, .P6 for Pocket, and .P97 for Pyramid, to name a few. The
final line of the call number was determined by the publisher series
number on the item (e.g. no.75002 or F-234). Thus a call number for an
Ace Book will look something like this:
</p>
<p>PN
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>.A23
</p>
<p>G-123
</p>
<p>105
</p>
<p>Popular fiction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Besides establishing the call number series, a 490 0 series was created for
both the publisher&rsquo;s name and number (e.g. Ace books ; |v G-123 and
another with [Vintage Ace Books ; |v G-123]) for the local name of the
series. Subjects and form/genre headings were added. There were a
number of books requiring original cataloguing (perhaps around 10&ndash;20%)
and quite a few with older existing records that needed updating. The
standard book format of OCLC was used to create these records. The
basic fields are shown in Table 6.1.

<p>Examples

<p>Examples of catalogued vintage paperbacks are provided below.
In Example 6.8 the author field 100 1 is a straightforward example.
</p>
<p>There is an existing authority record for this author in OCLC that
includes both birth and death dates. The 245 field also includes a subtitle,
along with the title that is separated by the colon |b before the |c for the

<p>Table 6.1
Standard fixed fields for cataloguing vintage paperbacks
(italics signify BGSU default values)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>author field. A 250 edition statement has been added for the Pocket
Books edition to distinguish it from the 1939 Farrar &amp; Rhinehart
edition. The 260 publication information includes the place, publisher,
and both the current publication date and the previous date. This would
also appear in the Date and DtSt fixed fields which are the 008 line in
the BGSU record. There is a t in the DtSt field for different publication
and copyright dates and both dates, 1943 and 1939, are included in the
008 fixed field area. The two 490 series statements have been added,
with the second 490 appearing in [ ], meaning this was created by BGSU.
The cover artist is noted in a 500 note and also as an alternate author 
in the 700 1 field. Finally, the LC subject (650) and genre/form (655)
headings have been added to describe the subject areas of this book.
</p>
<p>Example 6.9 is similar to the previous example, except it is a non-fiction
book. The author (100 1), title (245), and subtitle (245 |b) information are
created as normal for book format, with the addition of the illustrator in

<p>the 245 |c section after the author. The 250 edition statement is similar to
Example 6.8. The 260 field includes an additional |b for Pocket Books as
the distributor, rather than the publisher, and there is only one publication
date in the 260 |c field. The 300, physical description, field includes a |b
ill., meaning that there are illustrations in the book. Again, the 490 series
are added and LC subjects are added for the author and the Marines and
World War II. The illustrator is also added as a 700 1 alternate author
field.
</p>
<p>Example 6.10 shows an additional title from a British publication.
This is accounted for in a 500 note and a 740 02 alternate title field. All
other bibliographic fields follow standard AACR2 format. Once again,
an LC subject heading has been added and a 655 genre heading as well.

<p>Movie, television, and radio scripts
</p>
<p>Introduction
The popular entertainment collections at the BPCL include thousands of
scripts in three types: movie, radio, and television (TV). As resources,
many of these are priceless, donated by those involved with the
productions (e.g. a script donated by Tim Conway from the reunion show
of the Carol Burnett Show), or scripts from the 1950s and 1960s of well-
known soap operas no longer on the air (e.g. Search for Tomorrow, Edge
of Night). Additionally, several of the television scripts have handwritten
revisions (e.g. episodes of M*A*S*H). A great many of the movie scripts
are dated revisions of famous films (e.g. Midnight Cowboy), but countless
others are written by unknown screenwriters and may never even have
been produced or filmed. Most of the radio scripts are from Dupont&rsquo;s
Cavalcade of America radio show.
</p>
<p>This three-part chapter includes guidelines for cataloguing the three
different types of script mentioned above: movie/film, television, and radio.
</p>
<p>A: Movie scripts
Scripts are valuable primary resources, allowing students and scholars the
opportunity to study a screenwriter&rsquo;s work over time or to study different
revisions of one particular work, especially if they differ from the released
film. Scripts can also be used to study how different screenwriters have
tackled novel adaptations or revisions of classic films. In addition, scripts
are useful as illustrating one step in how to develop a screenplay or an idea
for a film.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Challenges
Because of the various types of scripts held in the BPCL, cataloguing 
them presents many deviations from the cataloguing norm. Some of the
challenges include: unknown or little-known authors and films, many
script revisions, and difficulty in finding authoritative information about
either the films or the writers.
</p>
<p>The best course of action when dealing with such challenges is to have
a clear idea of the basic format, and to follow it as closely as possible, in
order to fit the needs of the collection and its users.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing movie scripts at BGSU
Cataloguing scripts is very similar to cataloguing books, but with a few
differences. First of all, determine whether the script is complete. Some
scripts donated to BGSU are incomplete, as many of them are photocopies.
These are typically not kept. Second, use copy cataloguing where possible,
though this is rarely done for scripts at BGSU, since many of the titles are
unique to BGSU. Most of the script records at BGSU are original
cataloguing.
</p>
<p>Since there is no format in AACR2 for scripts, the closest available
format is the book format, which is used at BGSU. However, while general
book descriptions include the following: statement of responsibility, title of
resource, edition statement, publication information, physical description,
series information, note fields, standard book numbers, and so on, many
scripts do not have this kind of information. A great number of these 
are not published or produced, and so do not contain the standard
information one finds in books.
</p>
<p>Typical fields found in a movie script include: statement of
responsibility, title of film, and date of particular version of film. These are
usually found on the title page of the script, which is the chief source of
information. Standards force one to use as much information as one can,
although in many cases much of the record is left blank, since the
information is simply non-existent. Guesses must sometimes be made as to
publication information (e.g. place of publication and publisher), or it
must be left out altogether.
</p>
<p>Tables 7.1 and 7.2 show some of the fixed and variable fields used for
movie scripts.

<p>Examples
</p>
<p>The following are examples of records for movie scripts in the BPCL.
Notice the record in Example 7.1, which is fairly typical of the basic script
records in the BPCL: a title, two screenwriters, and a date, although there
is not always even that much information on some of the script holdings.

</p>
<p>260 Year of publication is usually the only information available
</p>
<p>300 Scripts usually have page numbers, but occasionally the pages
are unnumbered and 1 v. is used instead. Page or leaf numbers
are used for scripts that are paginated.

</p>
<p>740 02 Additional title field for variations in film title</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In Example 7.1 the record is a fairly simple one, except that a 700 field
is needed to reflect the additional name in the 245. Of course, the first
screenwriter listed goes in the 100 field and each additional screenwriter
has a 700 field. The second indicator of a 2 denotes the presence of the |t,
which is used to link the screenwriter with the title of the screenplay.
Brackets are used around the and in the 245, since the word is not used on
the item itself.
</p>
<p>In the 260, only the date is used, since there is no apparent publisher or
place of publication. These are intentionally left blank, but [S.l. : |b s.n.]
could be used as well.
</p>
<p>In the 300 field, page numbers are used, since the script is photocopied
double-sided. If it were photocopied single-sided, leaves would be the
term used. Additionally, scripts are typically 28 cm. tall.
</p>
<p>On many scripts there is a specific date of revision or draft, which would
be added in quotes in a 500 field, but there is none on this one, so the only
500 field used is for Photocopy. This particular script had only a year for
publication information, which was placed in the 260 field. The majority

<p>Example 7.1 Basic movie script record</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of scripts have a title page, and if the date is on this page it is not put in
brackets.
</p>
<p>Subject headings are assigned after a fair amount of research in film
reference books, online sources, or by reading the script. Oftentimes,
however, it is unnecessary to read the script, as a basic synopsis of the film
can usually be found in resources in print or online. Nevertheless, it was
necessary to read this script, as no information could be found to obtain
even a synopsis of the film. The record reflects that the film is about
gambling and crime in Las Vegas, hence the 043 n-us-nv, and Gambling
and crime and Las Vegas (Nev.) in the 650 and 651 fields respectively. The
Drama subdivision is after the |v to denote a drama rather than a work of
fiction. As is standard practice in the BPCL, &ldquo;Motion picture plays |y
2001&ndash;2010&rdquo; is also present in another 650, to signify the decade in which
the script was written.
</p>
<p>Occasionally, even more added entries are needed in the bibliographic
description. For example, a script may be based on a novel, or written
by one person and revised by another. A number of variations exist, as
can be seen in the following examples.
</p>
<p>Example 7.2 is a record for a script that is based on a novel and has one
or more revisions. Because it is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith and
has additional revisions by James Ryan and Terry Kinney, the director, it
necessitates three additional 700 fields: one for the author of the novel and
two for the writers of the revisions. At the BPCL it is common practice to
assign those individuals mentioned in the 245 a 700 field. In this case, a
700 was assigned to Terry Kinney as well, from the 500 note, since this
seems to be a significant enough revision to be mentioned on the title page.
</p>
<p>In the 245 are the title and the |b [screenplay], which is in brackets
because it is not written on the title page. Following that are the original
screenwriter, the writers of the novel and the first revision. Adding the
&ldquo;director revision ...&rdquo; line would make the 245 fairly long, so it is
preferable to put additional added entry information in a 500 note.
</p>
<p>This script has a publisher and place of publication listed, along with a
year, so the 260 field is complete. This is also used for the addition of cau
in the Ctry fixed field instead of xxu, which reflects that the publisher is in
California in the United States, even if the place of publication is uncertain.
In the 300, leaves is used, since the text is on only one side of the page.
</p>
<p>Since there is an exact date of revision &ndash; &ldquo;Director revision by Terry Kinney
4/1/02&rdquo; &ndash; it is entered in a 500 note. The statement is entered in quotation
marks it because it is a direct quote from the title page. More frequently, the
revision dates do not have names associated with them and are simply entered
as they appear on the title page, but with quotation marks around them.
</p>
<p>117
</p>
<p>Movie, television, and radio scripts</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For the subject headings, research was performed online, since this film
does not appear to have been produced, and therefore would most likely
not have representation in standard reference sources. Typically, the
Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is consulted first for online information.
Another good online source of information is the All Movie Guide (AMG).
If nothing is found in either of these sites, a search engine such as Google
is used to ascertain whether another website has any information or
whether an article has been published somewhere about the screenwriter
or the film. In this case, a short synopsis was found on Hollywood.com &ndash;
individuals interacting with each other in Greenwich Village, New York
City. It is enough to assign basic subject headings. This gives the record a

<p>Frequently, a script has a title that is a preliminary title, often called a
working title. This is not the title that the film uses when released. In
such cases, additional fields are required, as shown in Example 7.3.
</p>
<p>It is not yet clear upon first review of the script that the title written
on the title page is not the title of the released film, but it is safe to
assume that the 100 field would be &ldquo;Leven, Jeremy&rdquo;, with Lord Byron&rsquo;s
name in a 700 field (see MARC record for actual name authority) and
that the 245 would have only the title from the title page. The record was

was the working title and the film was released under Don Juan
DeMarco, hence the 245 that is in the current record in brackets.
</p>
<p>Because the film was released under the title Don Juan DeMarco, that
title was used for the 730 field. However, because that is not the title on
the title page, the 740 field was used as well, with the title Don Juan
Demarco and the centerfold. Along with using the 730 and 740 fields to
reflect two different titles, additional information is also entered in the 245
field. Standards call for the use of the title on the title page as the first entry,
but the released title is entered in brackets, with i.e. preceding it, before the
|b. A 500 note is also added to reflect that the original title is the working
title and the film was released under a different title.
</p>
<p>The 260 and 300 fields are relatively typical: only a date for the 260
(in which the year of the revised draft is used), and the number of leaves
and size for the 300 field.
</p>
<p>Since there is a specific date for this revised draft, a 500 note is added
copying verbatim the wording used on the title page, thus the quotation
marks around the note.
</p>
<p>This record also has a fair number of subject headings, which
enhances the findability of the record.

<p>B: Television scripts &ndash; introduction
There are many different kinds of TV scripts in the BPCL, such as: TV
pilot episodes, series episodes, made-for-TV movies, and soap operas.
Made-for-TV movie scripts are very similar to regular movie scripts, but
other television scripts can differ substantially from movie scripts.
Episodic television is by nature different than working on a film. Events
happen faster on television and there is oftentimes a stage atmosphere,
especially with series that are filmed in front of live audiences. TV scripts
are useful examples to study if one wants to write for television,
especially where there may be several writers working on a particular
series. TV scripts can also be used to examine how characters are
developed over the course of a television season.
</p>
<p>Challenges
Challenges in cataloguing TV scripts include incomplete information on
the actual items, and difficulty in assigning subject headings because of
the serial nature of these programs (similar to the challenges with special
periodicals). Subjects are typically very &ldquo;general&rdquo; or vague and, for
some, not very useful. These challenges make it difficult to assign subject
headings or even to fill out an entire record.

Cataloguing TV scripts is much like cataloguing movie scripts. The most
significant differences are evident in the scripts from episodes of TV
series. Unfortunately, over the years, standard practices have changed in
regards to cataloguing these types of script. This will be addressed
throughout this section, as ideas are given about how to enhance these
older records. The exercises in Appendix 7 provide some opportunities
to enhance records used in the examples below.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Many of the scripts from series TV in the BPCL were previously
catalogued as one record, rather than each episode being catalogued
separately, as is current practice. This is first evident in the 260 field, where
the dates, if there are scripts with dates ranging over a span of years, 
must be presented as a year range. If a TV episode script is catalogued
separately, the 260 typically contains a single year, but the record can also
have a 518 field, which allows the cataloguer to input the broadcast dates
or premier dates for pilot episodes and the like. Tables 7.3 and 7.4 show
some of the fixed and variable fields for cataloguing TV scripts.

</p>
<p>Lang eng (majority of scripts are in English)

<p>Dates Most times there is a date, but frequently research needs to be
done to find an approximate date, or even decade

</p>
<p>100 1 Screenwriter&rsquo;s name &ndash; used if the script is for a made-for-TV
movie or an episode of a TV series &ndash; do not use if creating a
record for the entire series (series typically have many writers 
for one program)
</p>
<p>245 10 Title of program along with screenwriter(s), if applicable &ndash; is
typically just the title of the program, especially for a series
record
</p>
<p>260 Use the production company as the publisher and the address as
the place of publication &ndash; year is entered, if available (single year
for a single episode or a made-for-TV movie; range of years for a
series record)
</p>
<p>300 Scripts usually have page numbers, but occasionally the pages
are unnumbered and 1 v. is used instead. Page or leaf numbers
are used for scripts that are paginated (e.g. 68 p. or 112 leaves).
For multi-volume series records, use simply v.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>The following examples are representative of the many different kinds 
of television script the BPCL holds. Be aware that in some of these
examples certain field codes and standard cataloguing practices have
been changed since these items were catalogued (e.g. 710 20 would now
be 710 2) &ndash; these will be addressed throughout this part of the chapter.
</p>
<p>Made-for-TV movie script records are very similar to regular movie
scripts, covered earlier in this chapter. The MARC record for the script
in Example 7.4 is relatively complete, as there is more information on the
title page of this script than there is for many of our other scripts. There
are two scriptwriters, so the record necessitates a 100 field for the first
writer, Ann Marcus, and a 700 field for the second writer, Ellis Marcus,
using the name authority records, of course. The 245 field contains the
title as it shows on the title page (which, it should be noted, is not the
first page of the script), and the writers&rsquo; names are written as they show
on the title page, with the ampersand between the two names.
</p>
<p>The cataloguer of this script chose to use the 250 field for the
particular draft of the script, Production draft, Oct. 12, 1978, with the
month abbreviated, as is the custom in the 250 field. In most of the more
recent script records in the BPCL, the particular draft of screenplay is
placed in a 500 note with quotation marks around it (see earlier movie
script examples). Either way is correct.

in the BPCL are originals)
</p>
<p>518 Broadcast date(s) or date/time the program premiered and on
which channel &ndash; many times this information is unavailable
</p>
<p>540 Duplication of materials must comply with applicable copyright
laws. &ndash; listed in every script record
</p>
<p>650 0 Television plays |y xxxx-xxxx &ndash; this is the default subject heading
currently used for scripts &ndash; the year range changes according to the
publication date, if applicable; Motion picture plays |y xxxx-xxxx is
used for made-for-TV movies and the television format is reflected
in the subject and genre headings
</p>
<p>700 12 Additional authors with |t for title, if applicable
</p>
<p>730 0 Name of program (Television program)
</p>
<p>740 02 Additional title field for variations in film title</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It is fortunate that the title page contains a production company name
(which acts as the publisher, for cataloguing purposes), but unfortunate
that there is no place of publication. One could infer that the place was
most likely somewhere in California and put that in brackets with a
question mark, or [S.l.] can be used, as this record shows. With many
scripts, extra research must be done to determine place of publication,
which would also have brackets surrounding it because the information
does not exist on the title page itself.
</p>
<p>For the 300 field, leaves is used instead of p., since there is text on only
one side of the page, and, once again, scripts are usually 28 cm.
</p>
<p>Field 500 notes are used to further describe the item. The second 500 could
also be changed to a 520 field, since it defines part of the contents of the script.
</p>
<p>In the 650 field, Television scripts is used as a subject heading for many
of the TV scripts, though current practice differs by using Television plays
|y xxxx-xxxx. For this example of older cataloguing practices, Women
soldiers would be an appropriate subject heading to use as well to enhance
the record. Other appropriate subject headings would be: 610 2 United States
Military Academy or 610 1 United States. |b Army. |b Dept. of West Point.

<p>The BPCL has numerous soap opera scripts, many of them dating
from the 1950s. Example 7.5 records information for the long-running
soap Days of Our Lives.
</p>
<p>Many of the Days scripts do not have a great deal of information on
them, but some do have detailed information and this record reflects
that. The 245 field indicates that there is no clear statement of
responsibility, as there is information only for the |a area. For the 260,
only the date is clear; the BPCL&rsquo;s holdings began in 1968 and the
program is currently broadcast, thus the open-ended date. Since this is a
record for the entire run of episodes, it would be difficult to clearly state
one &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; for this run, given that for some episodes there is one
production company and for the others another production company, as
is evident in the second 500 note. However, NBC-TV and Burbank, CA

the statement of responsibility. If the executive producer or creators were
known, their names could be entered here. If this were a record for a
single episode, producers, directors, or writers could be entered here. The
260 field includes the dates of the scripts that BGSU holds. In the 300, v.
is used to signify volumes for the entire set, instead of particular pages.
</p>
<p>The first 500 field includes the additional pieces of information that
can be found on the title page. There are additional 500 fields for the
production company as well as for the standard Draft versions may vary.
The 590 local note denotes the particular collection to which this script
belongs. Subject headings are included but are very basic, given a set of
episodes rather than a particular episode. The production company is
included in the 710. The 730 holds the title of the series, with Television
program in parentheses, similar to movie script records. This particular
record has a 740 field to hold the title, with Dr. written out as Doctor.
This field is also traced to increase findability.
</p>
<p>The record in Example 7.7 reflects the series overall, with the 245 field
being the title that the series was commonly known as and the |b showing
the title that is on the title page. Additional information on the cover and
title page of the script includes the title of the episode, which is not
reflected in the record, since this is a record for the entire series. The 260
field has the series&rsquo; inclusive dates, with the 300 having the standard v. and
28 cm. size. In the table preceding the MARC record, notice the &ldquo;place of
publication&rdquo;, which could be used in the 260 field as well.
</p>
<p>There are several 500 notes, which cover something about the episode
numbers and other items that are included in the scripts, as well as the
production companies that produce the show. There are two local notes
(590) to indicate that this script is part of a particular collection (to which
many of the BPCL&rsquo;s scripts belong) and that there may be variation
between drafts of scripts.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Since this is a series about a particular real person, there is a 600 note
to indicate Loretta Young as one of the subjects. The other subject
heading is the very broad Television scripts. There is a 730 for the
uniform title of the series as well as a 740 for the a.k.a. title.
</p>
<p>The record in Example 7.8 is similar to the previous example, in that it
is for the set of scripts held in the BPCL, rather than for the entire series.
The 245 has only the title of the show, but executive producers or creators
could be entered here. As with the other examples, if this were a record for
a single episode, other crew members could be listed here as well. For
example, writers, producers, or directors could be listed. The 260, once
again, only has the inclusive dates, but not the publication information,
which can be found on the title page. The 300 field is similar to previous
examples and there are several 5xx notes. The first signifies that episodes
have no organized numbering system and the second denotes other
information included in the script itself. Paramount Pictures Corporation
is the production company listed on the title page, but the exact name,
taken from the authority files, is Paramount Television Productions, which
is indicated in the 710 20. 
</p>
<p>One difference between this record and the previous examples is that the
contents of the BPCL holdings are listed in a 505 field. With many of the
BPCL&rsquo;s television script holdings this would be ill advised, as there are too
many episodes to list. As the final 590 field indicates, this script is a part of

<p>It is current practice in the BPCL to catalogue television scripts as
single episodes rather than entire series. The following records are
examples of that practice. Example 7.9 is a record for a single episode of
the television program Starsky and Hutch.
</p>
<p>In Example 7.9 the 099 field, for a local call number, is one full entry
rather than the number separated by the |a, reflecting current practice.
The 245 is also more complete, with the title of the program, then the title
of the episode after the |b, followed by the statement of responsibility
after the |c. There is also a 246 with the title of the episode itself. The 250
(edition statement) indicates that this is the final draft and gives the date
as well. This could also be added as a 500 note, enclosed in quotation
marks, which is current practice for original records at the BPCL.
</p>
<p>The 260 field reveals the current practice in regards to publication
information. It contains not just the years that the series ran, but also the
production company and the place of publication, which were absent

<p>of the |b, which has the episode title. The episode title is also repeated in the
246 1 in order for it to be traceable. The title page has three names, the first
of which is entered in the 100 1 field. In the statement of responsibility in the
245, they are entered in the order in which they appear on the title page, with
an and in [] to signify that there is no and on the title page.
</p>
<p>The 260 contains only a year in brackets with a question mark. This
indicates that there is no year written on the title page and there is some
doubt as to when this episode was actually written, i.e. it is an estimated
date. The 300 field contains the number of leaves of the script and the size,
28 cm.
</p>
<p>There are only two 5xx fields and one of those is for the standard
photocopying and copyright statement, the entering of which is current
practice at the BPCL. The other indicates that there is some kind of number,
perhaps an episode number, on the cover as well as on the title page.
</p>
<p>Subject and genre headings are assigned: one for Married people |v
Drama, which applies to the subject matter and another for Television
scripts, which is a fairly generic heading for the format of this resource.
The genre heading Comedy television programs. |2 gsafd, is entirely
appropriate for this type of resource.
</p>
<p>Because there were three names on the title page, the last two have to
be accounted for in the 700 1 fields. A 730 0 field for the television
program&rsquo;s official name rounds out the record.
</p>
<p>The script in Example 7.11 is from a television program that has been
categorized in The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and
Cable TV Shows 1946&ndash;Present (2007) as a &ldquo;dramatic anthology&rdquo;. Each
episode was a separate story about a citizen of Hollywood, but a fictional
story instead of a documentary, which makes these scripts somewhat
difficult to classify. Topics varied widely from episode to episode,
therefore subject and genre headings are either non-existent or very
generic, but much of the record above is similar to other script records.
</p>
<p>The title page lists the writer of this particular episode, which is then
entered in the 100 1 field. The 245 is fairly standard as well, with the
series title first, the episode title after the |b and the statement of
responsibility with the writer&rsquo;s name. The episode title is repeated in the
246 1 field so as to increase findability.
</p>
<p>On the title page a draft version is listed, the first draft, which is
entered in the 250 field. This could also simply be entered in a 500 field,
with the exact wording and date enclosed in quotations (see the movie
script examples earlier in this chapter). The 260 field has only the date,
which is on the title page, but the production companies could be
included in this field with a [S.l.] or [California?] for the place of

<p>publication. If the production companies were to be included, they
would each need a 710 field. The 300 field is standard, with 25 leaves
for number of pages and 28 cm for the size of the script.
</p>
<p>There are two 500 notes: one for the exact date of draft listed on the
title page and one for the episode number. The 540 is the standard
photocopying and copyright statement. Since this script is part of a
named collection, the 590 reflects that.
</p>
<p>The record is finished with a 650 of Television scripts and a 730 for
the official title of the television program.
</p>
<p>The BPCL has a number of scripts for television pilots, both titled and
untitled. The following examples are representative of BGSU&rsquo;s holdings.

Most of the radio scripts held by the BPCL are from the radio show
DuPont Presents the Cavalcade of America. They&rsquo;ve been catalogued
with one series record and each item record is listed. The URL
(www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/pcl/page49005.html) for the inventory
of all of the episodes is linked to the record in the 856 field. The number
of episodes was too large to catalogue each one separately, thus the URL

<p>Summary
Cataloguing movie, TV, and radio scripts can be challenging, but for
those studying scripts for a particular writer&rsquo;s work or for scriptwriting,
these records can be a great asset. If the scripts are part of a closed
collection, detailed records such as those in the examples in this chapter
are essential.
</p>
<p>Challenge yourself
Because the example above for radio scripts is the only one that the
BPCL holds, the exercise for this part of the chapter is fabricated, but
based on a real radio show (Dunning 404). Answer in Appendix 7.

</p>
<p>Introduction
Movie and television press kits in the BPCL are numerous and cover the
years 1929 to the present. Most are in paper format, though an increasing
number of current kits are available on CD or on the web. Press kits
typically are used for marketing films or television shows and include such
items as: a fact sheet or lead sheet (resembles the title page of a book or a
short story about the film; for the purposes of cataloguing these materials,
they have the same function), production information, biographical
information, cast and credits listing, photo stills (usually black and white
when in print, color when electronic), press releases, and occasionally ad
slicks (currently called key art or one-sheets) and ideas for marketing the
film or television program in particular venues (Marich 149).
</p>
<p>Many of the older movie press kits are in booklet form, often called a
&ldquo;press book&rdquo; &ndash; typically a one-piece, oversize item containing ad-slicks
that can be ordered for theaters or video stores, as well as information
about the film and the major cast and crew. In addition, these often
contain many more ideas for marketing the film than do the newer press
kits &ndash; for example, using films to market particular products. The more
recent kits have a standard format, each piece of information being a
separate item within the folder.
</p>
<p>Television press kits are similar to movie press kits, but are typically
not as comprehensive in their coverage of the program, most likely
because of the episodic or serial nature of many television programs.
Additionally, many television press kits do not follow a standard format
as do movie press kits. A number of the kits in the BPCL focus on
individual television series; others include: awards shows, documentaries
on PBS, made-for-TV movies, mini-series, and more. Some of them are
fairly &ldquo;old&rdquo;, dating from the 1950s and 1960s, most are newer.
</p>
<p>This chapter uses examples from the press kit collection at the BPCL.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Challenges
Challenges inherent with these types of material include: incomplete kits,
the problems that arise from not having enough information about the
film or television show to complete the records, and difficulties with
authority work. The BPCL has made a practice of keeping only press kits
that are populated with enough information not readily available
elsewhere. Many of the older kits (the press books) received at the BPCL
are incomplete and mutilated, unfortunately, which forces staff to purge
material that otherwise might be useful.
</p>
<p>Authority work with names associated with films and television
programs is covered in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>Cataloguing movie press kits at BGSU
Before beginning the cataloguing of these resources, it was determined to
use the book format for most of them, as it was the closest format
available. Occasionally, the computer file format has to be used for press
kits that are completely electronic (on CD) or that have most of their
materials in electronic format. Tables 8.1 to 8.3 show the fixed and
variable fields used for the movie press kit records, in book format and
on computer file. Many fixed fields are the same as for a typical book
record, except the LitF, which uses a 0, for Not fiction (not further
specified). The DtSt typically has only one date and Lang typically uses
eng. Ctry varies according to where the production company is located.
In the variable fields, the nature of these resources dictates that the
cataloguing must be more flexible.
</p>
<p>There is no 100 field, since there is no one person responsible for these
productions. In the 245, the title of the film is listed along with the main
crew responsible: director, producer(s), writer(s). Before we catalogued
the first press kit, we determined that these three responsibilities would
be the most visible, as they are usually listed in movie credits as three of
the highest-billed individuals. All other main responsible individuals
(actors, executive producers, cinematographers, film editors, production
designers, songwriters) are listed in the 508 and 511 fields, and also in
700 fields. As one might expect with resources of this nature, there are
many 5xx fields: 511, 508, 520s, 500, 540, 518, etc. It is important to
note that much of the information contained in these press kits is almost
unavailable anywhere else. Oftentimes, the production and biographical

<p>and sometimes more. For a researcher looking for information on these
&ldquo;behind-the-scenes&rdquo; individuals, press kits can thus provide a wealth of
information.
</p>
<p>Assigning subject and genre headings to these kits is not usually so
difficult as with other resources, simply because a synopsis of the film or
television program is typically included as part of the kit. The need to go
outside of a press kit to find information about a film is infrequent.
</p>
<p>In addition, the records usually have numerous 7xx fields for:
individual cast and crew members listed elsewhere in the record,
production companies, and the uniform title for the film. Any individual
included in the 245, 511, and 508 fields has an associated 700 field.
</p>
<p>Determining the chief source of information for press kits is not easy,
since a kit has no actual title page. The kit as a whole is therefore considered
the chief source of information, no matter where the information is found
within it. The current practice at BGSU is that if one has to look outside of
the press kit itself, that information is put in brackets.
</p>
<p>Examples
</p>
<p>The following examples are actual records in the BPCL press kit collection.
Example 8.1 is a good example of a basic print-based press kit. For reasons
of space, actual titles and names are not listed in the examples.
</p>
<p>Example 8.1 represents a fairly standard press kit record. There are no
real surprises. Newer press kits frequently have a loose-leaf sheet, called
a fact sheet (or lead sheet) at the BPCL, which contains much of the basic
information needed to fill in a catalogue record. This kit, however, has a
cover letter with the same type of information on it. Much of the
information comes from the booklet, which makes up the bulk of this kit.
</p>
<p>For the press kit collection, a local call number (099 field) is used
instead of an LC call number. As long as it is accessible and findable, a
local call number seems to work best. The press kits are kept in boxes,
so each one has an assigned box number (e.g. Presskitsbox01) and an
assigned file number. The file number is assigned in the item record, but
in the bibliographic record only the box number is entered.
</p>
<p>The 245 for this kit is fairly typical, with the name of the movie, followed
by [press kit] in the |b. In the statement of responsibility, the BPCL lists 
the producers, directors, and writers of the film. All other responsible
individuals are entered into the 511 and 508 fields. In the 260, because no
place of publication is found in the press kit, [S.l.] is used, with the publisher
and year entered in the |b and |c respectively. If a place of publication can
be found in another source, it must be placed within brackets.

<p>In the 300, instead of page numbers, 1 portfolio (xx pieces) is used to
indicate how many separate pieces the press kit has. The size, 31 cm, is
typical for a press kit.
</p>
<p>The 511 1 field lists the main cast members and comes first in the 5xx
note order, with the associated character names in parentheses alongside.
Because cast members are frequently numerous, this field is limited to
listing the main six or seven cast members. The 508 lists the remaining
main crew members, i.e. those not listed in the 245 field. These, more often
than not, are the executive producer(s), the director of photography or
cinematographer, the film editor(s), production designer(s), and the
individual responsible for the musical score.
</p>
<p>Press kit records typically have two 520 fields; one for the synopsis of
the film and another to list what the kit contains. The 540 is the default
copyright statement used in all of the BPCL records. The film synopsis,
if it is a direct quote from the source, must have quotations around it,
and the source is listed.
</p>
<p>This record has several subject headings assigned to it, the first of which
is the default subject heading used for movie scripts as well as for movie
press kits &ndash; Motion picture plays |y xxxx-xxxx. All others reflect the topic
of the movie. All press kits use the local subject heading (e.g. 690), Press
kits. Genre headings are assigned if appropriate ones are available.
</p>
<p>The 700 fields reflect all of the individuals listed in the 245, 511, and
508 fields. Name authority records are used to format the names, if

<p>available. Creation of name authority records for individuals involved 
in movie making is covered in Chapter 9. The 710 2 field(s) is the
production company, which uses corporate name authority files if
available. The record is completed using the 730 0 field for the name
under which the film was released, followed by (Motion picture).
</p>
<p>Example 8.2 is characteristic of many of the older press kits in the
BPCL. Most of the BPCL&rsquo;s older press kits do not have a standard &ldquo;fact
sheet&rdquo;, unlike the newer kits, but have much of the information on 
the front of the kit or book (which looks much like the movie poster for
the film). These older kits were usually called &ldquo;press books&rdquo;. In this
example, information for the 245 field was readily available. The 260
field is relatively sparse, given that no place of publication was provided
anywhere on the item, and the year of release had to be found elsewhere.
Since this is in booklet form and paginated, page numbers were used in
the 300 field in place of the more standard 1 portfolio (xx pieces), which
is used for the newer, multi-piece kits.
</p>
<p>Following standard 5xx note order, the 511 field is the first field used
for notes in the press kits. Listed are the main six or seven cast members,
with the actor&rsquo;s name listed first, followed by the character&rsquo;s name in
parentheses. Next is the 508 field.
</p>
<p>Normally two 520 fields are used, one for the items in the press kit
itself and one for the summary of the film. Typically, the summary 520 is
first. The 540 field is the standard copyright notice that is entered into
every record.
</p>
<p>Subject and genre headings are typically numerous, since the BPCL has no
direct access for users of these resources. Access points are very important.
</p>
<p>The 7xx fields are usually numerous as well. The sheer number of
individuals listed in some press kits is staggering, and so the numbers of
individuals listed in the record are limited, for reasons of time and space.
The production company(ies) are listed in the 710 2 and the official title
of the motion picture is in the 730 0 field.
</p>
<p>For many of the following press kit examples, for reasons of space
minimal information is listed in the tables. Abundant individuals are
added to these records, as is evident in the MARC record examples.
</p>
<p>The record in Example 8.3 represents one of the newer press kits in the
BPCL. It also represents a common difficulty presented by this type of press
kit: because of the nature of the format (CD with some accompanying
material), what format should be used to catalogue it? Since most of the
press kit information is on the CD, it was decided to use the computer file
format and acknowledge the presence of additional material within the
record.

<p>The computer file format used for these press kits is similar to the
book format, but the 007 tag is used as well as the 538 tag. In addition,
the 245 and 300 fields look a bit different, as well as the fixed fields, as
indicated in Table 8.2 above.
</p>
<p>With the computer file format, the 007 field must be present. In this
case, the field contains subfields |a, |b, and |d, all of which are mandatory.
In the |a is entered c, which indicates that this is an electronic resource. The
|b subfield contains a c as well, which stands for computer optical disc
cartridge (a.k.a. CD). Subfield |d had a c, which means this is a multicolor
item. Subfield |e indicates the size of the item, which is g in this case, at 
4&frac34; in. Subfields |f and |h are, respectively, a for sound (this CD has sound),
and m, indicating that multiple file formats are associated with this CD.
</p>
<p>With a computer file, the |h must be present in the 245. It is located
before the |b statement. With this type of record, this would look like
Title of movie |h [electronic resource] : |b [press kit] / |c statement of
responsibility. This record also has a 246 with the &amp; spelled out as and.
In this 260, Franchise Pictures is the publisher, but no location was
found, so [S.l.] has been used instead for the place of publication.
</p>
<p>The 300 field is different for a computer file because the description of
the item is important to note. First is 1 CD-ROM, to indicate what kind
of computer file it is; then the |b states that this CD contains sound and
color files. The |c states the size of the CD, and the |e states that additional
material is included with this press kit &ndash; in this case, two print booklets.

<p>positions are important for an animated movie. For example, in the 508
several supervising animators are listed as well as an art director. These
are not typical positions that are listed in live-action movie press kits.
Additionally, in the 245, there are animated screenplay writers.
</p>
<p>Since this is a film to which many high-profile actors contributed their
voices, there are many more names in the 511 1 than there normally

<p>006 field has been added for the accompanying CD-ROM and the 300
has been modified a bit to include extra material. In the 006 the first m
signifies that the extra material is a computer file and the second m
signifies that the information in it is a combination of text and graphics.
In the 300, similar to the CD press kit record above, a |e is added after
the size of the item, following a + sign (e.g. 30 cm + |e 1 CD-ROM). This
information is added to increase the findability of the record. In the
library catalogue at BGSU, if a 006 field exists the record can be searched
or limited to as a book, and also as a CD (computer file).
</p>
<p>The 043 field is included in this record because one of the subject
headings used is 651 0 Buenos Aires (Argentina) |v Drama.
</p>
<p>Much of this record is very similar to other examples in this chapter.
The next record, Example 8.6, represents one of the biggest challenges
posed by press kits: sparse information in hand.
</p>
<p>The press kit in Example 8.6 contained a postcard with information in
a very small font on the front. It also had a short booklet with some
additional information. Because the postcard was so difficult to read,
much of the information for the record came from the booklet &ndash; which
had enough information for a basic record and was easily readable.
</p>
<p>Notice the 043, which includes the code for Thailand, where the film
takes place, also represented in the subject headings. The 245 is fairly
straightforward, but close attention must be paid to names like these, to
make sure that they are accurately entered in the record. There are three
246 fields: one for the &ldquo;at head of title&rdquo; statement, one for the title as all
one word (written that way on some of the materials in the kit) and one
for what looks like a subtitle &ndash; but its status is uncertain, so it is entered
into a 246. The first indicator on the first 246 is a 1 indicating that it
should print as a note and an added entry. The second 246 has a 1 as the
first indicator (prints as note and added entry) and a 3 as the second
indicator, for the fact that it is another title. The third 246 uses a 3 as the
first indicator (prints as an added entry only) and a 0 as the second
indicator, which means it is a portion of the title.
</p>
<p>The remainder of the record is fairly straightforward, excepting that
there appear to be duplicate subject and genre headings. Genre headings
are not always searchable in library catalogues and there are not always
appropriate genre headings for every film, so there are some Library of
Congress subject headings that are similar to or the same as some genre
headings. These can be used with the 650  0 tag or with 655  0 tags,
without the |2 and source of the genre heading (e.g. gsafd). For example,
the heading Historical films could be entered as 650  0 Historical films
or 655  0 Historical films.

<p>The above are just a few examples of the movie press kit records at
BGSU. The next examples are from the TV press kits in the BPCL.
</p>
<p>The first example of TV press kits, Example 8.7, is a documentary on
portrayals of women and African Americans in western films. This is an
exceptional example of using the entire press kit to gather information.
There are no fact sheet, no booklet with production and biographical
information, and no cast list, only the name of the host. Still, there is
enough information to fill out most of a press kit record effectively. Notice
the 099, which is the local call number field, which lists tvpresskitsbox01
to distinguish it from the movie press kits. Many of the TV press kits are
very different from movie press kits, because there are so many different
types of TV program, such as older primetime programs, documentary
programs like those on The Discovery Channel or PBS, made-for-TV
movies, newer primetime programs from the big three networks (ABC,
CBS, NBC) or from cable networks, awards shows, Olympics coverage,
and many others. Movie press kits are more standardized.
</p>
<p>In the 245, note the title with subtitle and the statement of responsibility,
which is in brackets. This information was found outside of the press kit,
since there was no such information available in the kit itself. The same
goes for the 260: the year for this program was found outside of the kit.
In the first subfield, the place of publication could have been [S.l.], 
but [United States] was chosen since TNT is most likely based in the
United States. Thus, the fixed field Ctry has xxu entered for the generic
United-States-with-no-particular-state designation.
</p>
<p>In the 300, there are actually 9 pieces to this press kit, since each slide
is counted, even though they are stored in a slide keeper. The 511 1 only

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>has one entry, for the host, James Garner. There is no cast, since this
program is a study of several movies, not a series television program. The
TV press kits use the 518 field to include the broadcast date or premier
date (in the case of regular series television). Usually, as much
information as can be found should be entered in this field.
</p>
<p>Enough information was included in the meager items to provide a
basic synopsis of the program, so there is enough information for a
summary 520. The second 520 is the &ldquo;press kit includes&rdquo; note.
</p>
<p>Appropriate subject and genre headings are included to enhance the
findability of this record. Notice, instead of Motion picture plays, TV
press kits use Television plays |y xxxx-xxxx. There are only 700 fields
for the individuals entered in the record. The 710 2 field is for the
network name and production company(ies). In the 730 0, the title of the
program is entered. Instead of (Motion picture), as used in the movie
press kits, TV press kits use (Television program). The exception to this
rule is made-for-TV movies, which still use (Motion picture) and reflect
the TV nature of the program elsewhere in the record, such as in the
subject headings.
</p>
<p>Example 8.8 is another good example of sparse information on the
actual kit. This particular program was broadcast in the later 1970s,
apparently under a slightly different title than that on the press kit. The
cataloguer of this record used Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com) to
verify years of broadcast and found that the title on the press kit does
not match the title used in IMDb. The Complete Directory to Prime
Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946&ndash;Present was consulted to
validate information found in IMDb, and IMDb was found to be correct
in the title of the program. See the record in the example.
</p>
<p>The 245 reflects the difference in titles. This issue was first discussed
in Chapter 7, on scripts, when a script has a working title that differs
from the released title. The same approach was used for this record. The
first part of the 245 reflects what is on the press kit and the actual
broadcast title is entered in brackets directly after it. In a 500 note,
reference is made to each title&rsquo;s status. A 730 0 is used for the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
title of the program, with the &ldquo;working&rdquo; title in a 740 02.
</p>
<p>Even though this press kit had minimal information, there was still
enough available to fill in most of the fields. Present are the main cast
members, the two executive producers, and a synopsis of the series, which
is enough to assign subject and genre headings. It is obvious from the
synopsis that the series takes place in California, thus the record has a 043
field (e.g. 043 n-us-ca) as well as a 651  0 field (California |v Drama). Even

<p>though this series is clearly a comedy, the |v Drama is used to denote a play
or dramatic work. The comedic nature of the program is represented in the
genre heading Comedy television programs.
</p>
<p>Example 8.9 is representative of newer TV press kits, with a great deal
of information &ndash; and possibly more information sources available
outside of the kit, should they be needed.
</p>
<p>This press kit is fairly straightforward, but notice in the 245, in the
statement of responsibility, that there are names only for the creator and
producers. In episodic TV programs there are typically many writers and
directors, and their names will most likely not be mentioned in the press
kit. In the 300, notice also that there is only one piece to this kit. Instead
of several separate items, it consists of several parts in one piece,
information which is included in the second 520 field. The 518 is used
to denote the premier date, with as much information as is available.

Cataloguing press kits can be a time-consuming process, but is well
worth the effort for those users who may be looking for background
information about, or individuals working on, a film or television
program &ndash; information that cannot always be found on websites or in
reference books. Enhancing these records to this extent increases their
findability in library catalogues.

<p>Authority work
</p>
<p>Introduction
Authority work (or the checking and creating of name and subjects
headings) is an important part of the cataloguing process. It is a way to
distinguish name headings and to link the various names of an individual
or group under one or more headings. Headings range from the simple 
to very complex, depending upon the name being established. Name
headings are created to distinguish individuals or groups associated with
catalogued materials. Authority records can also be created for subject
headings and form/genre headings. This chapter will examine name
authority records for both individual and corporate headings for the
special collection materials such as those described in the foregoing
chapters.
</p>
<p>Challenges
There are various challenges in creating and verifying name headings. One
is authors writing under pseudonyms, whether these are joint pseudonyms
(used by more than one individual) or multiple pseudonyms of the same
author. Cross references or additional authority records need to be created
to account for all headings. Another challenge is lack of information to
distinguish two individuals of the same name. Even with all of the print
and online resources available today, there are times when information is
simply unavailable.
</p>
<p>Another challenge is verifying which established heading might be the
correct one, based on what is being catalogued. With common names such
as &ldquo;John Smith&rdquo;, it can be difficult to decide which existing authority
</p>
<p>165
</p>
<p>9</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>record might be the correct heading, or whether an authority record exists
for the name on the item in hand.
</p>
<p>The final challenge is in deciding when to add a qualifier to a name,
or when to attach to an undifferentiated record (a record that does not
distinguish between persons with the same name).
</p>
<p>Creating authority records at BGSU
BGSU creates authority records under both the Name Authority
Cooperative Project (NACO) and the NACO Music Project (NMP). All
names associated with popular sound recordings, and with some scores,
are created under the NMP with a separate OCLC authorization. All
other headings are created through the regular NACO process. BGSU
cataloguers attended NACO training and were subjected to a review
process for a period of time before becoming independent contributors
of music and non-music authority records. Institutions or cataloguers
must receive training to be contributors to the authority file.
</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the records created at BGSU are most helpful in the
cataloguing process, since it is easy to verify whether a person or group is
the same as the name in the authority file when BGSU owns other works
by the same person or group.
</p>
<p>The examples presented in this chapter begin with simple personal and
corporate names and progress to more complex headings with qualifiers,
pseudonyms, and cross references. Also included are the print and online
tools used to help in creating and verifying headings for the various types
of format.
</p>
<p>The standard fixed fields are shown in Table 9.1.

<p>Examples
</p>
<p>The following examples are of name authority records created or
enhanced at BGSU.
</p>
<p>Example 9.1 is an authority record representing an individual author
of a score, with a date of birth included. The 670 reference line shows
the format used by NMP for scores, which includes the last name of the
author followed by the first name initial. The date is next, with the |b
subfield showing that the information was taken from the cover,
including the date of birth.
</p>
<p>Example 9.2 is a record for a film actress included in one of the movie
press kit records at the BPCL. For all authority records, the more unique
items of information that can be included, the better. In this case, the
actress&rsquo;s name is itself unique, but it is more common practice at BGSU
to add at least one other unique piece of information to authority
records, such as a birth year or middle initial, included in the 100 1 with
the |d. The first 670 refers to the initial source of this name, where this
actress is listed in the credits. Credits is the wording often used for
sources related to movie and television, where the chief source of
information is not a title page, but a piece of the video recording or a
piece of a press kit. The second 670 source refers to a search in the
Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for additional information. Often, this
is one of the only places where information can be found on those
involved in the entertainment field. Many of the available reference
books are too outdated to include current information. To reflect the
source from IMDb, the name of the website is included, with the date of
access, followed by the |b with the name of the person as it appears in

<p>the source and, in this case, her birth date and occupation. Notice, after
the date of access, that there is no colon, which is used only when there
is wording outside of the parentheses after the |b.
</p>
<p>When using the IMDb for additional information, if it were to yield an
alternate name, perhaps, the |b in the IMDb 670 would need to reference
that also. For example, if Ms. Bleeth had been found to have a nickname
or another name, that information also would need to be included with
her birth date (e.g. |b Yasmine Bleeth; actress; b. June 14, 1968; also
known as Yasmine A. Bleeth). There would also need to be a 400 field
to reflect that.
</p>
<p>Example 9.3 is a record representing an individual author, with a see
reference for a different version of her name. The format for the 670 line
is the same as in Example 9.1, with the exception of an added area for
where the other name was found on the score. The |b section includes the
cover with one version of the composer&rsquo;s name and the caption area with
a different version of her name. The 400 1 line presents the different
spelling as a see reference.
</p>
<p>Example 9.4 is an authority record for a corporate authority name for
a musical group. The 670 line is created as per NMP instructions. The
author is first, then the album title (which in this case happens to be the
same as the author). The [SR] stands for sound recording and the date of
the recording is next. The |b field shows that the name of the group was
found on the label of the recording.
</p>
<p>The only difference between Example 9.5 and the previous example is
the 670 line. There is no individual author at the beginning of the line,
just a title, followed by [SR] and date and the |b information.

<p>Example 9.6 shows a name with a number in it, thus the need for a
410 2 see reference. The number is spelled out in the 410 2 see reference
field. Also, this record is from a compilation album, so there is no author
at the beginning of the 670 line.
</p>
<p>The record in Example 9.7 represents a rapper&rsquo;s name, without a
surname. See references have been made for the reverse version of the
name as well as for the real name of the performer. The first 670 line is
the description from the album. The second 670 line is from the website
All Music Guide, with the information that was found about the rapper&rsquo;s
real name and date and place of birth.
</p>
<p>The musical group in Example 9.8 is associated with Count Basie. The
110 2 has Count Basie after Musical group. This is because there are a
number of other groups called All-Stars. Count Basie has been added a
qualifier to differentiate this group from the others. Also, Count Basie
has been added as a 500 1 see also reference. The other 410 2 see
references have been added because they were found on two different
albums with these headings. The 670 lines represent those two albums.

<p>Examples 9.9 and 9.10 represent two versions of identical names.
Example 9.9 represents the musical group version of the name; Example 9.10
is for the person named Manfred Mann. This is not a typical situation,
but it does happen from time to time. The group authority record includes
various see references for the versions found on different albums, as well
as a 500 1 see also reference for Manfred Mann the person.
</p>
<p>The second authority record includes a 400 1 see reference for
Manfred Mann&rsquo;s real name. The information was found in the Guinness
Encyclopedia of Popular Music, as noted in the final 670 line. There is
also a second authority see also reference, which is not shown here, that
links the individual record to the musical group authority record.
</p>
<p>In Example 9.11 the authority record includes a |c in the 100 1 field for
the qualifier blues vocalist. It has been added to distinguish this person
from someone else with the same name. A 675 line shows what sources
were checked to find biographical information about this person. Since no
year of birth was found, the |c blues vocalist was added instead. In such
cases, reference sources need to be entered to show that research was
conducted to locate information, if available. Qualifiers are added to many
authority records to distinguish names from one other. Various reference

<p>sources, both print and online, are now available and can be checked.
Numerous reference sources are available for popular music names, but it
can still be difficult to find appropriate sources, or sources that have
information about current names.
</p>
<p>Many authors of fiction works use pseudonyms. Some are joint
pseudonyms that are shared between two or more individuals; others
belong to a writer who uses many pseudonyms, typically to write under
different genres or subgenres. The following examples are of a joint
pseudonym and multiple pseudonyms.
</p>
<p>Example 9.12 is a fairly good example of a joint pseudonym heading,
although it was not created by BGSU. It originated with the book,
Licence to thrill, which has two different author names in a statement on
a page opposite the title page verso. Research suggests that neither of
these authors appears to have written as anyone other than as Tori
Carrington, therefore only 400s are used for cross-references, indicating
that these names are not used elsewhere. There is also a 400 field for the
name in another language, to which the two 667 (non-public general
note) fields refer. The 670 refers to the initial source of this name, with
the locations of the various names found. To enhance this record, it
would also be appropriate to add a 663 field to explain that this is a joint
pseudonym, with wording such as: Joint pseudonym of Tony and Lori
Karayianni. Works by this author are entered under the name in the

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>pseudonym of the author in the basic heading. Notice that the basic
heading in Example 9.13a shows three names in 400 fields. According to
the third 670, two of these are names that were found to be pseudonyms
of the author, but none is in use in OCLC. The first 400 is a variant listing
of the author&rsquo;s established name, just in case someone searches under
Campbell Thomson, Christine instead of Thomson, Christine Campbell.
It should be noted, and as seen in the 040 field, that this record was only
enhanced by BGSU, not created.
</p>
<p>Further names were added to enhance the heading and reflect that there
is not one pseudonym, but several. The name in the 100 field is the
established name, and birth and death years are included with the |d,
which further establishes uniqueness. Since there are years in the
established name, these years need to be included on all names listed in
the basic record as well. The exception is a name that is already
established in OCLC and already has a name authority record with no
years listed. There is one such name in the basic heading here, in the
second 500. The first 500 is another name in use, but the years are added
to that, since it is created at the same time as the basic record is being
enhanced.
</p>
<p>The 663, for extended explanations, lists the other names under which
to search. The 670s are for verifying the names by listing sources where
the information is found. The first 670 was already in this record. The
others were found during investigation into this author&rsquo;s pseudonyms.
The second 670 verifies the birth and death years of the author. The third
verifies the pseudonyms and that Christine Campbell Thomson is indeed
the real name of this author. The fourth 670 verifies that one of the
pseudonyms is used to write short stories, which, most likely, will not be
entered into a record in OCLC. Note in the third and fourth 670s, that
after the |b is the exact place in the source where the information was
found. Thus, the colon is needed right before the |b.
</p>
<p>Since there are two 500 see also references in the basic heading, there
must be corresponding headings for the pseudonyms listed in those
fields. Example 9.13b relates to the first 500 name, Alexander, Dair, |d
1897&ndash;1985. These headings must always have a 500 field with the
established name in it, formatted the same as the 500 fields in the basic
heading. Again, there is a 663 for additional explanation. This example
contains typical wording for a pseudonym. The first 670 refers to the
original source of this particular name, with the location of the name
after the |b and then the wording of the name in the source. The second
670 is the same as in the basic heading that verifies the pseudonyms of
the established author name.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Example 9.13c is an enhanced record, not originally created by BGSU.
It is the 500 field that was already in use in OCLC, so only needs to be
revised to fit the enhanced basic heading. There is a 400 field in this
record, which was found in one of the sources in the 670s that verified the
name in the 100 field, but misspelled the author&rsquo;s last name. This must be

The 663 field is again used for extended explanations. The first 670 refers
to the source which verifies the name in this heading and also notes the
misspelling of the last name. The second 670 verifies birth and death dates
and is found, initially, in the basic heading. The third 670 indicates that
this name is verified in the LC database.

<p>Summary
Authority work is an essential part of the cataloguing process at BGSU.
The authority examples presented above represent the kinds of situation
that can arise with special collection formats, as well as other types of
material. While many names do not require research and can be created
immediately, there are still a number of names that do require research
to distinguish like names. It is appropriate and very helpful to use
reference tools to assist in creating unique authority records. The sources
listed above are just a few that have been helpful for the types of material
catalogued in the special collections at BGSU. It is hoped that the
authority examples listed will provide insight into the value and certain
complexities of authority work.

<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>Cataloguers of special collection materials can work with some of the most
interesting and valuable parts of a library&rsquo;s holdings. Primary sources such
as those presented in this book can provide rich resources for researchers
and other users, particularly if they have been made accessible to the public
in the online catalogue or through digitization projects. However, useful as
these materials are, they can sometimes pose challenges beyond those of
standard book and periodical formats for the cataloguer. Some of these
challenges have been presented in this book. They can include situations
such as lack of information, publication variances, title variances, name
authority conflicts, difficult subject and form/genre assignments, and lack
of resources to verify information. These can all make for a difficult job,
especially if one is working with more than one special collection format.
The formats presented in this book (scores, popular music CDs, fanzines,
comics, graphic novels, periodicals, fiction, press kits, and scripts) are all
common materials, catalogued at BGSU on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>It is hoped that this book will provide other cataloguers, and perhaps
students new to the library profession, with guidelines and a starting point
for approaching special collection formats. Although some of the examples
shown are formatted for local BGSU cataloguing practices, there are
usually other solutions for particular situations. Being able to use one&rsquo;s
judgment is just part of the cataloguing process.
</p>
<p>The world of cataloguing is always changing and updating, but perhaps
never more so than at present, with the upcoming publication of RDA &ndash;
Resource Description and Access. While this new method of cataloguing
will require changes in cataloguing processes, materials must still be made
as accessible as possible to users. The cataloguer&rsquo;s job still remains an
integral part of the process of making materials, particularly those rich
resources in special collections, available to patrons.

instrumentation and for chopsticks. A 538 system requirements field has
been provided, although it is not a typical field used in score formats. A
500 note has been added for the program and biographical notes and
performance instructions included with the score.

<p>Exercise 1.3 is an unusual piece in that it does not include notated music.
There is only text, as instructions for the piano player and the page turner,
thus the 500 note for no playing on an instrument. This type of 500 note
is open to interpretation on wording, but should be included as an
explanation. The 650 subject heading for Humorous music has also been
added, based on the text provided for performing the piece.

<p>Exercise 2.2 is an album that shows how performers&rsquo; names can cause
confusion when cataloguing items. The 511 0 field shows the performer
as 60 Channels (also known as Angel). The label also listed the author
as 60 Channels. After further research, it was found that 60 Channels
was the same person as Angel, who already had an authority record
established. A 400 cross reference was added to the authority record to
account for 60 Channels. Other 500 notes have been added to this
bibliographic record to account for the location of the publisher number
and the title for this album.

<p>Exercise 2.3 represents a compilation album with multiple performers
and songs, as seen in the 505 0 contents field. The artists are listed in
parentheses after the title they perform. The artists are also listed as
alternate authors in the 700 1 and 710 2 fields. There is no 100 1 author
field, since the authors are all in the 700 1 and 710 2 fields. The subtitle
reflects the fact that this is music originally from the 1960s. 650  0 subject
headings have been assigned to cover the complete decade of 1961&ndash;1970.
The first 650  0 is listed as To 1961, since this is the heading established
for rock music prior to 1961.

<p>Exercise 3.1 is a personal zine that includes comic-related material,
which is reflected in the 650  0 subject headings. The estimated starting
date in the 362 1 field is based on the fact that BGSU had only the No. 2
(June 1997) issue on hand at time of cataloguing, which is also
mentioned in a 500 note. The author is listed in the 100 1 field and the
260 imprint information is based on where the author resides. An extra
500 note has been added to reflect the original title and a 740 02 has
been included to be searchable as an alternate title.

The zine revolves around punk rock and rock music and also includes
reviews. These are all covered in the 650  0 and 690 subject headings.

<p>In Exercise 6.1a, notice that the place of publication is England, which
is reflected in the 260, the 440, and in the fixed fields (e.g. enk) in the
008 field. Using (Great Britain) following the series title distinguishes it
from the American series title (Exercise 6.1c). It also has a different
numbering system in the |v than the American version, therefore it is
best to catalogue it with the other series romances but to give this
English series its own cutter number in the PN6071.L7 classification.
To link it with the other titles, it also uses the same subject and genre
headings.

<p>Exercise 6.1b is the Australian edition of this story, as is evident in the
250, the 260 (place of publication), and the 440 (which would now be a
490). The author is the same, but the title is a bit different from that in
Exercise 6.1a. While Exercise 6.1a uses &ldquo;Live-in mum&rdquo;, this one (and
Exercise 6.1c) has &ldquo;Live-in mom&rdquo;, although it is the same story. Notice
the 440, the series title, is Silhouette special edition, as is used in Exercise
6.1c, except that it has (Australia) after it to distinguish it from the
American version in Exercise 6.1c. In the |v, the numbering system is
different also, and has a different cutter number in the PN6071.L7
classification.

<p>Exercise 6.1c, the American edition of the same story, is very similar to
the preceding exercises. They all use the 043 for the setting (place) of the
story, as well as the same subject and genre headings, which link them
together. The title is the same as the Australian one and the physical
description (300 field) is the same for all three. The most significant
difference is the 440 field, which has the series title without the place of
publication but with the numbering in the |v. The call number in the 090
has a very similar cutter number to the earlier two examples. The
American version of this series is by far the largest of the Silhouette
special editions in the BPCL, thus the cutter numbers in Exercises 6.1a
and 6.1 b are based on this original cutter number for the series.

<p>Exercise 6.2a is the oldest copy of this title and includes fairly basic fields. This
is one of the books about a character named Mongo (as seen in the 500 note)
and there is a 650 for the fictitious character. There are also other subject and
genre headings to describe the book. There is also a corresponding 043 for
the setting of the book. This is part of two named collections (see the 590s).
The second 590 states which copy is part of the second named collection. The
500 note phrase comes from the cover of the book and it is acceptable to
place it in a 500 note, with quotes to indicate a direct quote.

<p>Exercise 6.2b is a different edition from that in Exercise 6.2a: it is the
paperback version of the original hardbound Mysterious Press edition.
The only obvious differences are: the 250 edition statement, which does
not appear in the hardbound edition, but does appear on the verso of the
paperback edition; the 300 |c is 18 cm. instead of 24 cm.; and this is part
of only one named collection. The subject and genre headings are
consistent, as they should be when there are like records. This helps to
improve findability for these resources.

</p>
<p>Exercise 6.2c is another edition of the same title, but the only real
differences, again, are the 260 field (publication years are different); in
the 300 the size is different (21 cm.); and there is no statement about this
being &ldquo;A Mongo Mystery&rdquo;, since the phrase does not appear on the
actual item. The 260 field is different because this is a reprint of the
original edition by Atheneum, which is acknowledged with the original
copyright date following the publication date of this item.

</p>
<p>Exercise 6.3a is one of the older Harlequin romances that the BPCL
owns. It is a good example of one way to acknowledge a previous title,
which in this case was most likely published by Mills &amp; Boon. Often,
Mills &amp; Boon publishes the original work with one title and Harlequin
reprints it under a new title and a new imprint. In this record, the title
on the actual item is in the 245, with the previous title, as acknowledged
in the 500, in a 246 field. This is one way to establish a relationship
between two related records.

</p>
<p>Exercise 6.3b shows another way to maintain a relationship between two
related records. Establish a uniform title with the 240 and the title on the
actual item in the 245. Books in the Harlequin&rsquo;s collection series were
previously published in the Harlequin romance series. Many times, they
are given the title of the original Mills &amp; Boon edition. This record
mentions that this was originally entitled Hospital pro in the Harlequin
romance series, which is misleading, since the original work used this
title. There are many records like this one in the BPCL collection, and
plans are underway to accurately and consistently catalogue these types
of record. This is difficult if a library does not hold all versions of a work
and not enough information is available about the original work and
original title. This record, when compared to that in Exercise 6.3a, may
not be catalogued in this manner, when all is said and done.

<p>Exercise 7.2 has a rather different 245. In the |c, after the screenwriter&rsquo;s
first name, there is a statement in brackets which suggests that the
writer&rsquo;s first name on the title page is not spelled correctly. In researching
this film to find a synopsis, the writer&rsquo;s name was found to be spelled as
&ldquo;Neena&rdquo; rather that &ldquo;Nenna&rdquo;, hence the [i.e. Neena] in the 245. It is
spelled in the name authority file as &ldquo;Neena&rdquo;. This script is based on a
novel by William Sleator and has revisions by a writer other than the
original screenwriter, and there are corresponding 700 fields for each
additional person.

<p>From the record in Exercise 7.3, one can clearly see what is different
about it. The title in the 245 does not appear to be actual words. How
does one determine that this was a working title? How does one find the
released title or the subject of the film?  To research this, since the
cataloguer had no clear idea of how to determine these pieces of
information, the writer&rsquo;s name was searched as well as the characters&rsquo;
names. IMDb.com is useful for searching character names. The released
title was found, and with it, the subject of the film, thus subject headings
could be assigned. The same format as Exercise 7.1 was followed, with
the released title in brackets after the title from the title page in the 245.

<p>If there were one production company responsible for all of the scripts
in Exercise 7.4, it would be appropriate to include it in the 245 and the
260, but this program has more than one, so each field is correct in this
record. 511 1 and 508 fields could be added for main cast members over
time (or the span of years in scripts held in the collection) and also main
crew (e.g. executive producers).
</p>
<p>Subject headings such as Small cities, Families, or Families |v Drama,
Love |v Drama, Interpersonal relations |v Drama and others could be
added to this record. All are generic enough to describe this program&rsquo;s
main themes. Television plays or Television scripts could be used for
genre headings.

<p>In Exercise 7.5, if this set of scripts from Mork and Mindy were to be
catalogued now, it would likely be split into individual script records. In
that case, the date of each script would be entered, and possibly the date
of broadcast, if available, in a 518. Subject and genre headings could be
added to the record above, or to the record of each individual episode.
An appropriate subject heading for the record above might be Human-
alien encounters |v Drama. Genre headings could include Fantasy
television programs or Comedy television programs.
</p>
<p>Since this program has just one production company, this should be
added to the 245 and 260 fields. 511 1 and 508 fields could be added as
well, to acknowledge main cast and crew. Of course, 700 1 fields would
need to added also, to trace these individuals.

<p>In Exercise 8.1 the biggest challenge is the non-standard format of the
press kit. It was mostly a little booklet with several photocopied articles
about the show, so it really had none of the usual pieces of information
that are typically included in a press kit. The Animation Show was a series
of smaller animated short films and was shown in only a few theaters
around the United States. Because the main booklet appeared to be
somewhat incomplete, there was some uncertainty as to whether the
record had enough information. A lot of comparisons were made between
a few of the articles that were with the press kit to make sure all of the
information was included.
</p>
<p>This compiled film had two creator/compilers, along with several
creator/directors for each segment, which leads to a fairly complex 505
field and several 700 fields. No real topical subject headings that can be
used, since too many different short films are compiled, so the 650
headings are for Animated films, Short films and the standard Motion
picture plays and the local Press kits.

<p>Exercise 8.2 also has a non-standard format, slightly more complete that
the previous exercise, but still a complex example of a press kit. This film
is a series of short films, each being a dramatic movement set to a
classical aria. The record therefore needs to accurately reflect each
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>responsible person, including the producer of the film, the composer of
each aria, the title of each aria, the director of each short film set to each
aria, and each vocalist who sang in each aria.
</p>
<p>The record includes a 500 note with the composers of the arias and there
is a 505 with the titles of the arias and the names of the composers, the
directors, and the vocalists. With so much information in the 500 notes,
there needed to be 700 fields for each person, which also included the actors
in the short films. The challenge came when it was time to put together the
700 12 fields with the composer, the title of the opera, then the title of the
aria. There are also three 710 fields for the production companies.

<p>As mentioned in Chapter 8, with series television there are typically
many directors and writers for each episode, so unless there is a record
for every episode, there is no need to acknowledge each and every writer
and director in the record, but instead the producers who oversee the
entire series are acknowledged. The same holds true for press kits, as is
evident in Exercise 8.3. The information for the 508 was found in the
first booklet, which listed synopses for each episode of Alive TV as well
as the series credits (i.e. all of the producers and the production
company). The other booklets are focused on particular episodes and
naturally have credits for those episodes only, and are therefore not
represented in the record for the entire kit.
</p>
<p>In the 245, notice the statement of responsibility that says &ldquo;produced
by KTCA Minneapolis/St. Paul&rdquo;. Even though this was broadcast on
PBS, it was produced by a particular public television station, so that is
who is listed in the 260 as the publisher. There is a 500 note stating what
is included in this press kit; this is similar to the second 520 that is
always present for any press kit, but slightly more descriptive than what
can be included in the second 520.
</p>
<p>In the subject heading fields, it is difficult to assign all appropriate
subject headings for a program which spotlights so many different
topics. It is simpler to assign subject headings based on the overall series,
as is evident in this exercise. The 7xx fields are few with this kit: 7xx
fields for the producers, the production companies, and the companies
providing the funding. The record is completed with the 730 for the title
of program, with (Television program) alongside it.

surname, but including two see references (in 400 fields): one for another
performing name (Dope Style) and one for his real name. It is helpful to
add an additional 670 reference for the performer&rsquo;s real name if available.
