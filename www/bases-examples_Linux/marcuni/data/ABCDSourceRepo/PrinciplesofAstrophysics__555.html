<p>Preface
</p>
<p>This book is designed to show how physical principles can be used at the advanced
undergraduate level to understand astronomical systems such as planets, stars,
galaxies, and the universe as a whole. It emerges from a pair of courses at Rutgers
University that attract not just astrophysics students but a broad audience of physics
and engineering students. The organization is therefore &ldquo;physics-first&rdquo;: we start with
key principles of physics and then examine applications to astronomical systems.
</p>
<p>At Rutgers, each half of the book constitutes a coherent semester-length course;
while there is a little overlap (notably with cosmology in Chaps. 11 and 20),
the two halves are largely independent and complementary. Part I focuses on
gravity, because this is the dominant force in many astronomical systems and it
governs many types of motions we observe. The goal of Chaps. 2&ndash;11 is to develop
a progressively richer understanding of gravity and the way astrophysicists use
gravitational motion to investigate mass.
</p>
<p>Part II centers on one of the &ldquo;big questions&rdquo; we humans ask. Why are we here? is
admittedly beyond the realm of physics, but a related question is within our reach:
How did we come to be here? As the Sun was forming, various elements came
together in the right combination to form a rocky planet with a tenuous atmosphere.
On this planet Earth, the energy from the Sun and the gas in the atmosphere were
just right to allow the emergence of life. The energy that sustains us originates deep
inside our star, thanks toE D mc2. The atoms that comprise our bodies were forged
in previous generations of stars. Literally, we are star dust. The goal of Chaps. 12&ndash;20
is to understand the roles that electromagnetism as well as gas, atomic, and nuclear
physics play in this remarkable story.
</p>
<p>I hope this book will help you learn to think like an astrophysicist. Rather than
memorizing facts about specific astronomical systems, you will learn to break the
systems into pieces you can analyze and understand using material that should
be familiar from introductory physics and vector calculus. (The necessary physics
topics are reviewed as they arise; vital aspects of vector calculus are reviewed in
Appendix A.) Then you will be equipped to investigate interesting systems that you

<p>encounter in the future, even if they are not addressed in this book. Astrophysics
is a dynamic field of research&mdash;and one in which you can understand the physical
principles that underlie even the newest discoveries. So let&rsquo;s have fun!

<p>Acknowledgements
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No book is an island, entire of itself.&rdquo; That is not what John Donne actually wrote,
but it could have been. It is certainly apt here. This book would not exist in its
present form without the help of many people.
</p>
<p>Arthur Kosowsky originally developed the structure for the astrophysics courses
at Rutgers, which is reflected in the makeup of this book. Saurabh Jha, Eric Gawiser,
and JohnMoustakas have taught from this material at various stages of development,
and provided critical feedback. All contributed ideas for homework problems; and
many rounds of students have (perhaps to their chagrin) field-tested a lot of the
problems. The Rutgers Department of Physics and Astronomy, and in particular the
astrophysics group, has provided an environment where excellence in research and
teaching are both encouraged and supported.
</p>
<p>Art Congdon, Allan Moser, Erik Nordgren, Barnaby Rowe, and Tim Jones have
done yeomen&rsquo;s work with the manuscript. They provided extensive and insightful
comments throughout the drafting process, catching everything from typos to
muddled thinking. All remaining errors are my fault, not theirs!
</p>
<p>Many researchers have graciously let me use images and figures to illustrate the
material. They are too numerous to list here, but are credited in the figure captions.
</p>
<p>A number of books have contributed to my own learning, but two in particular
stand out. An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics by Bradley W. Carroll and Dale
A. Ostlie is a monumental survey of astrophysics at the undergraduate level. The
&ldquo;big orange book&rdquo; maintains a respected place on every astronomer&rsquo;s bookshelf.
Astrophysics in a Nutshell by Dan Maoz is a more focused treatise that shares a lot
of the spirit animating this book. Both have influenced my thinking about how to
present this material, as indicated throughout the text.
</p>
<p>Last but not least, my wife and son have not merely endured this absorbing
project, but actively endorsed it. To Kelly: thank you for letting me dream. To Evan:
if you can dream it, you can do it, but it might take more effort than you imagine.

<p>Mathematical Symbols
</p>
<p>Astrophysicists employ a variety of mathematical relations. One skill I hope you
will develop is a sense of how and when they apply. This book uses what I think are
conventional symbols to indicate the different relations:
</p>
<p>D strict equality
� strict equivalence (often used for definitions)
/ strict proportionality
� close approximation (e.g., Taylor series expansion)
� order-of-magnitude estimate
Here are symbols for comparative relations (with similar symbols for &lsquo;less than&rsquo;):
</p>
<p>&gt; strictly greater than
&amp; greater than or approximately equal to
� much (i.e., order of magnitude) greater than
We sometimes use symbols to indicate logical relationships:
</p>
<p>) implies

<p>We use two symbols to indicate a statistical average (choosing between them based

<p>Introduction: Tools of the Trade
</p>
<p>A concise way to state the scientific method in astrophysics is this: We use theory to
make quantitative predictions that can be compared with observations. Sometimes
we can solve the relevant equations with pencil and paper in a modest number of
steps, but other times we cannot. How do we proceed? Often we can use physical
insight and approximate calculations to understand the salient features of a system
without sweating the details. Before diving into technical material, it is good to
see how physical reasoning and estimation techniques (such as toy models, scaling
relations, Taylor series approximations, and dimensional analysis) offer a potent
approach to astrophysics.
</p>
<p>1.1 What Is Gravity?
</p>
<p>Understanding gravity opens the door to studying many fascinating systems, so it is
a natural place to begin. Plus, it provides a nice way to illustrate the analytic tools
that infuse our inquiry. You can probably recite Newton&rsquo;s law of gravity,
</p>
<p>F D GMm
r2
</p>
<p>(1.1)
</p>
<p>but where does it come from? Put yourself in Isaac Newton&rsquo;s shoes and imagine you
are trying to understand the motion of planets. Johannes Kepler has combed through
reams of observational data and distilled three laws of planetary motion:
</p>
<p>I. Planets move in elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus.
II. A line that connects a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
III. A planet&rsquo;s orbital period P and average distance from the Sun a are related by

<p>2 1 Introduction: Tools of the Trade
</p>
<p>These are examples of empirical laws; they are extracted from, and provide a
powerful summary of, observational data, but they do not explain in any physical
way why planets move as they do. Empirical laws can, however, offer clues that
help us find physical explanations, if we know how to reason with them.
</p>
<p>The first step is to recognize that Kepler&rsquo;s third law is an example of a scaling
relation. It answers the question: If you move a planet farther from the Sun, will
its orbital period increase or decrease, and by how much? The second step is to
see if we can relate the scaling relation we know to something we want to learn.
While I cannot say for certain, I imagine Newton&rsquo;s reasoning was something like
this: Galileo famously demonstrated that objects of different mass fall at the same
rate under the influence of gravity. Since a more massive object has more inertia, it
must feel more gravity; the gravitational force should therefore be proportional to
m. Then by Newton&rsquo;s third law of motion (equal and opposite reactions),1 the force
must be proportional to the product Mm. Surely gravity depends on the distance
between two objects; intuitively it should decrease with distance, so let&rsquo;s postulate
</p>
<p>F / Mm
rn
</p>
<p>where n is unknown. Let&rsquo;s call the constant of proportionalityK and write
</p>
<p>F D KMm
rn
</p>
<p>(1.2)
</p>
<p>The third step is to connect the two scaling relations. Here we might introduce a
toy model that is deliberately simple but (we hope) rich enough to capture the
essential physics. To build a toy model for motion under the influence of gravity,
we ignore Kepler&rsquo;s lesson about ellipses and just consider circles. From Newton&rsquo;s
laws of motion, we know the force required to keep an object of massm in a circular
orbit of radius r and speed v is
</p>
<p>F D mv
2
</p>
<p>r
D 4�
</p>
<p>2mr
</p>
<p>P 2
(1.3)
</p>
<p>where we replace the orbital speed v with the period P D 2�r=v in order to connect
with Kepler III. We then equate the force we have available (1.2) with the force we
need to explain the motion (1.3):
</p>
<p>KMm
</p>
<p>rn
D 4�
</p>
<p>2mr
</p>
<p>P 2
</p>
<p>1Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion are independent of his law of gravity. We will discuss them later; for
now we take them as given.</p>

</p>
<p>If we want to explain Kepler&rsquo;s third law (P 2 / r3), we apparently need the
gravitational force to follow an inverse square law (n D 2). This argument is only
heuristic; it cannot be taken as proof of Eq. (1.1). But imagine you were Newton
and had no one to tell you the law of gravity. An analysis like this would strongly
suggest the hypothesis that gravity is described by an inverse square law.2
</p>
<p>Once we know the gravitational force law, we might wonder how it affects our
everyday experience on Earth. Strictly speaking, we already have everything we
need to determine how gravity weakens with height (h) above the surface of Earth
(indicated by the radiusR˚):
</p>
<p>F D GM˚m
.R˚ C h/2
</p>
<p>This formula can be a little unwieldy, though, if we just want to know what happens
when we climb a mountain or fly in an airplane. Is there any way to simplify the
analysis when h is much smaller than R˚? Yes! Rewriting F slightly lets us make
the following approximation:
</p>
<p>F D GM˚m
R2˚
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>1C h

</p>
<p>(1.4)
</p>
<p>If h � R˚ then the second term in square brackets is much smaller than the first,
and the third term is smaller still so we can neglect it without making a significant
error. What we have done here is make a Taylor series expansion of F . This is a
form of estimation that we will use from time to time when we encounter functions
that are cumbersome, or we want to examine a function&rsquo;s behavior over some fairly
narrow range. In Eq. (1.4), the Taylor series shows that at &ldquo;lowest order&rdquo; (i.e., in the
first term) the force of gravity is independent of height above the surface of Earth.
In elementary mechanics classes we often write this as F D mg where3

you to get in the habit of doing this; it will help you catch errors and remember to convert units
when necessary.</p>

<p>4 1 Introduction: Tools of the Trade
</p>
<p>The minus sign in the second term of Eq. (1.4) then says gravity weakens with
height. While we knew that already, the approximation offers a simple way to
quantify this effect. Suppose we ask how much gravity varies when you go up in
a building or an airplane, or into the upper parts of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere:
</p>
<p>Example h 2h=R˚ 1� 2h=R˚
Building �6m 2� 10�6 0.999998
Airplane �6 km 2� 10�3 0.998
Upper atmosphere �60 km 0.02 0.98
</p>
<p>These numbers help us understand that you have to go pretty high (relative to the
atmosphere) for any change to be significant.
</p>
<p>To recap: we have combined an empirical scaling relation with a toy model to
deduce the form of the gravitational force law. We did not do any complicated math;
rather, we used careful physical reasoning. We also used a Taylor series expansion
to examine how gravity varies with height. I hope this book will help you cultivate
these types of analysis skills, which can be quite valuable throughout astrophysics
and beyond.
</p>
<p>1.2 Dimensions and Units
</p>
<p>Most of the quantities we discuss in physics and astrophysics come as numbers
with some units attached (such as meters or light-years). The units are crucial;
the numbers are meaningless without them. That said, units themselves are merely
conventions for how we express measurements. The more fundamental quantities
are dimensions (such as length). The distinction may seem subtle, but it is important
because units are fungible while dimensions are not. Analyzing the dimensions that
matter for a particular problem can be a good first step, as we are about to see.
</p>
<p>In this book we use a combination of SI and astrophysical units. While it may
seem unnecessarily complicated to mix different sets of units, there can be some
advantages. Using certain units can help build your intuition about the relevant
scales for different problems (e.g., it is more enlightening to specify star masses
in units of the mass of the Sun than in kilograms). Also, knowing that you may
encounter different sets of units can make you more vigilant about checking them.
As a general rule:
</p>
<p>In calculations, always check dimensions and units!</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Dimensions and Units 5
</p>
<p>1.2.1 Fundamental Dimensions
</p>
<p>The three key dimensions we use in physics are length, mass, and time. Here are
their units in the SI system:
</p>
<p>Dimension Unit
</p>
<p>Length ŒL&#141; m
Mass ŒM &#141; kg
Time ŒT &#141; s
</p>
<p>Other familiar quantities involve combinations of the fundamental dimensions:
</p>
<p>velocity v D dx

</p>
<p>ŒLT �1&#141;
</p>
<p>acceleration a D d

volume
</p>
<p>ŒL�3&#141;
</p>
<p>mass density � D mass
volume
</p>
<p>ŒML�3&#141;
</p>
<p>We sometimes invent special units to measure certain quantities. Some of the special
units are clearly combinations of fundamental dimensions (and their associated
units):
</p>
<p>Force Newton N D kgm s�2
Energy Joule J D Nm
Energy Electron volt eVD 1:60� 10�19 J
</p>
<p>Other special units might seem to be unique but turn out to be composites as well:
</p>
<p>&bull; Temperature is often measured on the Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin scale, but it
is actually a measure of energy. We can always convert a temperature in Kelvins
to an equivalent energy using E D kB T where
</p>
<p>kB D 1:38 � 10�23 JK�1 D 8:62 � 10�5 eVK�1</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 1 Introduction: Tools of the Trade
</p>
<p>is Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant.4 Astronomers sometimes invoke the equivalence
between temperature and energy by reporting the &ldquo;temperature&rdquo; of hot gas
in keV.
</p>
<p>&bull; Charge has a special unit&mdash;the Coulomb&mdash;in the SI system of units, but it
can actually be expressed in terms of the three fundamental dimensions. In the
Gaussian system of units, the force between charges q1 and q2 separated by a
distance r is written with no proportionality constant5:
</p>
<p>F D q1 q2
r2
</p>
<p>With this convention, we can identify the dimensions of charge as follows:
</p>
<p>q1 q2 D r2F
ŒQ2&#141; D ŒL2 �MLT �2&#141;
</p>
<p>) ŒQ&#141; D ŒM 1=2L3=2T �1&#141;
</p>
<p>This is one case in which I favor the Gaussian system, because thinking of charge
in terms of the three fundamental dimensions turns out to be very helpful for
dimensional analysis (as we will see below). In centimeter-gram-second units the
value of the electron charge is e D 4:8032� 10�10 g1=2 cm3=2 s�1. Converting to
meter-kilogram-second units yields e D 1:5189� 10�14 kg1=2m3=2 s�1.
</p>
<p>1.2.2 Constants of Nature
</p>
<p>There are some special, fundamental numbers in physics:
</p>
<p>Speed of light (in vacuum) c D 2:9979 � 108ms�1 ŒLT�1&#141;
Newton&rsquo;s grav. constant G D 6:6738 � 10�11m3 kg�1 s�2 ŒM�1L3T�2&#141;
Planck&rsquo;s constant &bdquo; D 1:0546 � 10�34 kgm2 s�1 ŒML2T�1&#141;
Electron charge e D 1:5189 � 10�14 kg1=2m3=2 s�1 ŒM 1=2L3=2T�1&#141;
Electron mass me D 9:1094 � 10�31 kg ŒM &#141;
Proton mass mp D 1:6726 � 10�27 kg ŒM &#141;
Neutron mass mn D 1:6749 � 10�27 kg ŒM &#141;
</p>
<p>4We often drop the subscript B to simplify the notation. Any k that appears in conjunction with T
is probably Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant.
5You might ask whether we could do something similar to redefine the dimensions of mass. The
answer is no, because mass appears not only in F D GMm=r2 but also in F D ma. We cannot
eliminate proportionality constants from both relations at the same time.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Dimensions and Units 7
</p>
<p>These allow conversions between the fundamental dimensions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Time$ length: ` D ct or t D `=c (think of a &ldquo;light-year&rdquo;)
&bull; Mass$ length: ` D GM=c2
&bull; Energy$ mass: E D mc2
&bull; Energy$ time: E D h� where � is frequency (or inverse time)
Using these conversions, you could argue in principle that there is really one
fundamental dimension: length. Theoretical studies of general relativity or quantum
mechanics often do such conversions. We will stick with length, mass, and time,
though, because they are familiar and keeping track of all three dimensions can help
us check and interpret calculations.
</p>
<p>1.2.3 Astrophysical Units
</p>
<p>There are some numbers that are used so frequently in astrophysics that they act
as a de facto set of units. Using astrophysical units can help us interpret quantities
quickly; for example, it is easier to get an impression of an exoplanet&rsquo;s properties if
we quote its mass and radius as 0:7MJupiter and 1:6RJupiter than if we specify them
as 1:3 � 1027 kg and 1:1 � 108m. We need to remember, though, that the quantities
we take as reference values are not fundamental; they just happen to be quantities
that are familiar in our corner of the universe. (Part of our goal as astrophysicists
is to see if we can explain why these quantities have the values they do.) Here are
some of the quantities we will use as astrophysical units:
</p>
<p>Mass Earth mass M˚ D 5:974 � 1024 kg
Jupiter mass MJ D 1:899 � 1027 kg
Solar mass Mˇ D 1:989 � 1030 kg
</p>
<p>length Earth radius R˚ D 6:378 � 106m
Jupiter radius RJ D 7:149 � 107m
Solar radius Rˇ D 6:955 � 108m
Astronomical unit AU D 1:496 � 1011m
Light-year ly D 9:461 � 1015m
Parsec pc D 3:086 � 1016m
</p>
<p>Our earlier discussion of Kepler&rsquo;s third law illustrates the value of picking good
units. The proportionality means there is some constant K such that P 2 D Ka3.
When we study planets orbiting the Sun, we can eliminate K by taking a ratio with
respect to Earth:
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 1 Introduction: Tools of the Trade
</p>
<p>Since P˚ D 1 yr and a˚ D 1AU (by definition), we can write

</p>
<p>P

</p>
<p>D

</p>
<p>(1.5)
</p>
<p>If we measure a planet&rsquo;s distance from the Sun in AU and orbital period in years,
we can write P 2 D a3 without any additional constants.6 Using appropriate units
for a problem can simplify things quite a bit.
</p>
<p>1.2.4 Dimensional Analysis
</p>
<p>Thinking about dimensions can be a good way to begin analyzing a particular
system. Before doing any detailed calculations, we might be able to make an
&ldquo;educated guess&rdquo; about the properties of a system just by finding combinations
of constants and scales that have the right dimensions. This approach cannot pin
down numerical factors of order unity (e.g., 2, � , etc.), but those are rarely essential
for conceptual understanding. Nor can it tell us what to do if we find several
combinations of constants and scales that have the right dimensions. If that happens,
we can use physical reasoning to choose among the possibilities. Let&rsquo;s see how this
works in a few examples.
</p>
<p>Planetary Motion
</p>
<p>Consider a planet orbiting at distance r from a star of massM , and suppose we want
to determine the period of the orbit. To make a dimensional analysis estimate, we
start by listing the scales or constants that are involved in the problem.We are given
r andM , and we know gravity plays a role, so we write this list:
</p>
<p>Distance r ŒL&#141;
Mass M ŒM&#141;
Gravity G ŒM�1L3T�2&#141;
</p>
<p>If we want to form a combination that has dimensions of time, we clearly need to
start with G�1=2. Then we includeM�1=2 to eliminate mass, and r3=2 to eliminate
length. Thus, we guess that the expression for orbital period should look like
</p>
<p>6This works only for objects orbiting the Sun, becauseK depends on the mass of the central object.
Equation (1.5) implies that we can writeK D 1 yr2 AU�3 for motion around the Sun.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Dimensions and Units 9
</p>
<p>P � r
3=2
</p>
<p>.GM/1=2
</p>
<p>Does our guess make sense? Consider the scalings: asM increases, the gravitational
force gets stronger, so things move faster and P decreases. Also, as r increases, P
increases with the specific relation
</p>
<p>P 2 / r3
</p>
<p>This is the scaling in Kepler&rsquo;s third law! In other words, we can recover Kepler III
from dimensional analysis alone. The exact calculation for a circular orbit (which
we did in Sect. 1.1) gives
</p>
<p>P D 2� r
3=2
</p>
<p>.GM/1=2
</p>
<p>Our dimensional analysis estimate was right up to a factor of 2� � 6, which is
not bad for such a simple analysis. Even more important is the fact that we got the
scalings correct.
</p>
<p>Black Hole
</p>
<p>In Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity, a point mass has an &ldquo;event horizon&rdquo; out
of which no physical object can escape (see Sect. 10.6). What is the radius of the
event horizon of a black hole with mass M ? Again, we begin by listing the scales
and constants we think are relevant:
</p>
<p>Mass M ŒM&#141;
Gravity G ŒM�1L3T�2&#141;
Relativity c ŒLT�1&#141;
</p>
<p>The combination that has dimensions of length is
</p>
<p>R � GM
c2
</p>
<p>The exact answer is the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole,
</p>
<p>RS D
2GM
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>Here dimensional analysis comes within a factor of 2.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 1 Introduction: Tools of the Trade
</p>
<p>Suppose we had incorrectly invoked quantum mechanics rather than gravity.
Then we would have used &bdquo; D ŒML2T �1&#141; and constructed
</p>
<p>R � &bdquo;
Mc
</p>
<p>Think about this for a moment: it would imply that more massive objects have
smaller event horizons. That would not make sense! There may be different
combinations of scales and constants with the dimensions we are looking for, but
considering the physical scalings can help us identify the best choice.
</p>
<p>Atom
</p>
<p>How big is an atom? The size is determined by electrons orbiting under the
influence of the electric force from the nucleus. The force must involve the electric
charge, while an electron&rsquo;s response to the force is affected by its mass. And the
whole problem is quantum mechanical in nature. Thus, we have:
</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics &bdquo; ŒML2T�1&#141;
Electric force e ŒM 1=2L3=2T�1&#141;
Electron mass me ŒM &#141;
</p>
<p>The combination with dimensions of length is
</p>
<p>&bdquo;2
me e2
</p>
<p>The scalings with e andme make sense: increasing the charge would strengthen the
electric force and pull the electrons closer, while increasing that mass would mean
the electrons do not move as much (less acceleration for a given force). In fact, the
combination we have found is the Bohr radius a0, which is the radius of the lowest
electron energy level in the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom (see Sect. 13.4.1). We
take it as characteristic of the sizes of atoms.
</p>
<p>1.3 Using the Tools
</p>
<p>In Part II of this book we will encounter gases in various astrophysical contexts.
Even before we study the details, we can use dimensional analysis to understand the
key properties of the gases, and then deduce a few features&mdash;some straightforward,
some unexpected&mdash;of different types of stars.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.3 Using the Tools 11
</p>
<p>1.3.1 Phases of an Electron Gas
</p>
<p>Our first goal is to uncover the equation of state relating the pressure of a gas to
its other physical properties. In many settings we will study, the gas is ionized and
most of the pressure comes from free electrons; hence we consider an electron gas.
There are different scenarios depending on whether the behavior of the gas depends
on quantum physics, relativity, both, or neither.
</p>
<p>Ideal Gas
</p>
<p>If quantum physics is not important, we can think of the gas as being made of
point particles that hardly interact with one another; this is a classic &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; gas.
Pressure is caused by particles bouncing off the walls of any container holding the
gas. Dimensionally, pressure is force per unit area so
</p>
<p>ŒP &#141; D ŒML�1T �2&#141;
</p>
<p>What quantities might influence the pressure of a classical ideal electron gas? The
speed with which particles hit the wall depends on the temperature, and the rate at
which that happens depends on how many particles there are. Are temperature (or
equivalent energy) and number density enough?
</p>
<p>Temperature kT ŒML2T�2&#141;
Number density n ŒL�3&#141;
</p>
<p>In fact, simply multiplying these quantities gives dimensions of pressure, so we put
</p>
<p>P � nk T
</p>
<p>A detailed analysis reveals that there are no dimensionless factors, and we have
actually recovered the famous ideal gas law (see Sect. 12.1.3).
</p>
<p>We might wonder whether relativity is important for an ideal gas. That is the
subject of Problem 1.5.
</p>
<p>Classical Degenerate Gas
</p>
<p>What happens when the density increases significantly? As the electrons squeeze
closer together, the main contribution to pressure comes from the fact that different
particles cannot occupy the same quantum state; in effect, the Pauli exclusion
principle kicks in to create what is known as electron degeneracy pressure. This
pressure would exist even if the temperature were zero, so the equation of state must
not involve T . What does it depend on?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 1 Introduction: Tools of the Trade
</p>
<p>Number density n ŒL�3&#141;
Particle mass me ŒM &#141;
Quantum mechanics &bdquo; ŒML2T�1&#141;
</p>
<p>To this point we have built dimensional analysis estimates basically by trial and
error. We can be more systematic, though. Let&rsquo;s postulate that the equation of state
has the form
</p>
<p>P � &bdquo;˛mˇe n&#13;
</p>
<p>where the exponents ˛, ˇ, and &#13; are to be determined. Plugging in the dimensions,
we obtain
</p>
<p>ŒM L�1 T �2&#141; � ŒM ˛ L2˛ T �˛ �M ˇ � L�3&#13; &#141;
� ŒM ˛Cˇ L2˛�3&#13; T �˛&#141;
</p>
<p>To match the dimensions on the left- and right-hand sides, we need
</p>
<p>1 D ˛ C ˇ
�1 D 2˛ � 3&#13;
�2 D �˛
</p>
<p>This is a system of three equations in three unknowns, whose solution is ˛ D 2,
ˇ D �1, and &#13; D 5=3. Thus, our equation of state for a degenerate electron gas is
</p>
<p>P � &bdquo;
2
</p>
<p>me
n5=3
</p>
<p>A complete analysis gives a dimensionless factor of .3�2/2=3=5 D 1:91 (see
Sect. 17.1).
</p>
<p>To find the transition between an ideal gas and a degenerate gas, we want to find
the point at which the two systems have comparable pressures. This is equivalent to
requiring
</p>
<p>Pideal � Pdeg ) kT �
&bdquo;2
me
</p>
<p>n2=3
</p>
<p>To find the transition between a classical and relativistic system, we can estimate a
typical speed
</p>
<p>v � &bdquo;

</p>
<p>n1=3</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

�mec
</p>
<p>&bdquo;
�3
</p>
<p>� 2 � 1037m�3
</p>
<p>Relativistic Degenerate Gas
</p>
<p>Finally we come to the case of a degenerate gas in which the particles are moving
near the speed of light. The energy of relativistic particles is dominated by motion
rather than mass, so me presumably drops out of the equation of state and c enters.
Thus, our list of ingredients becomes:
</p>
<p>Number density n ŒL�3&#141;
Relativity c ŒLT�1&#141;
Quantum mechanics &bdquo; ŒML2T�1&#141;
</p>
<p>As before, we put
</p>
<p>P � &bdquo;˛ cˇ n&#13;
</p>
<p>ŒML�1T �2&#141; D ŒM ˛ L2˛Cˇ�3&#13; T �˛�ˇ &#141;
</p>
<p>and solve to find ˛ D 1, ˇ D 1, &#13; D 4=3. This yields the equation of state
</p>
<p>P � &bdquo; c n4=3
</p>
<p>Where is the transition between a relativistic ideal gas and a relativistic degenerate
gas? That would correspond to
</p>

</p>
<p>kT

<p>Phase Diagram
</p>
<p>To recap, here are the equations of state we have estimated for the various scenarios
we have considered:
</p>
<p>Ideal gas P � n k T
Classical degenerate gas P � &bdquo;2m�1e n5=3
Relativistic degenerate gas P � &bdquo; c n4=3
</p>
<p>All of these expressions have dimensions of pressure, but our physical reasoning
has let us understand which expression corresponds to which physical context.</p>

<p>We also found the transitions between different regimes, so we can sketch a phase
diagram as shown in Fig. 1.1. The boundaries between the different regions are not
sharp (because we have only done dimensional analysis, which is not exact). But
this analysis does give a general picture of the type of gas we will encounter in
different settings.
</p>
<p>1.3.2 Stars, Familiar and Exotic
</p>
<p>The preceding analysis may have seemed esoteric, but it proves to be very useful
for understanding different kinds of stars. To make the connection, let&rsquo;s shift from
microscopic quantities like density and pressure to the macroscopic quantities that
we typically use to characterize an astrophysical object: massM and radius R. We
can relate them as follows:
</p>
<p>mass density � � M
R3
</p>
<p>number density n � M

<p>Such a star would be a little more massive that the Sun, but only as big as a city.
In fact, we observe this kind of object as a neutron star. (Real neutron stars are
probably not ultra-relativistic, but this analysis still gives a useful sense of the
physics. See Chap. 17 for more discussion.)
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>1.1. Use dimensional analysis to derive a relationship between the total massM of
a gravitationally bound system, its sizeR, and the typical speed v of its components.
Then use it to answer the following questions.
</p>
<p>(a) At what speed does the Earth orbit the Sun?
(b) Globular clusters typically contain�106 stars moving at speeds of�10 kms�1.
</p>
<p>How big are they?
(c) Spiral galaxies are typically about 10 kpc in size and rotate such that the stars
</p>
<p>move at �200 kms�1. Estimate the mass of a spiral galaxy (inMˇ).
1.2. Type Ia supernovae are exploding stars that have played an important role in
observational cosmology (see Chap. 18).
</p>
<p>(a) The exploding stars are white dwarfs that have a mass of about 1:4Mˇ and a
radius of about 5;000 km. Use dimensional analysis to estimate the gravitational
binding energy of such a star.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>References 17
</p>
<p>(b) The explosion is powered by nuclear fusion. Howmuch mass must be converted
to energy (E D mc2) in order to overcome the binding energy and explode
the star?
</p>
<p>1.3. Explosions such as Type Ia supernovae produce blast waves.
</p>
<p>(a) Use dimensional analysis to estimate the size R of a blast wave at time t after
an explosion with energy E , propagating into a medium of ambient density �.
(Hint: these are all the quantities you need; gravity is not directly relevant here.)
</p>
<p>(b) Information about the first atomic bomb tests was kept secret, but the physicist
Geoffrey Taylor estimated the energy of one test from published photographs
showing a fireball expanding through the air [2]. If the blast wave reached 100m
just 0:02 s after the explosion, what was the energy? What mass was converted
into energy? (Hint: you will need to look up the density of air.)
</p>
<p>(c) How large would the remnant of a supernova (E � 1044 J) be 1,000 years after
the explosion, as it expands into the interstellar medium with a typical density
of 106 hydrogen atom per cubic meter?
</p>
<p>1.4. The universe is believed to be about 14 billion years old. Use dimensional
analysis to estimate the average density of the universe. About how many hydrogen
atoms are there in 1 m3 of &ldquo;empty&rdquo; space?
</p>
<p>1.5. Can we treat the center of the Sun as a classical ideal gas? Let&rsquo;s find out.
</p>
<p>(a) Consider a gas at temperature T composed of particles of mass m. Use
dimensional analysis to estimate the typical speed of the particles.
</p>
<p>(b) Recall our estimate of the Sun&rsquo;s central temperature, T � 2 � 107K. This is
hot enough to ionize atoms, so electrons and nuclei move independently. What
is the typical speed of electrons? Of hydrogen nuclei? Are they relativistic?
</p>
<p>(c) At roughly what temperature does an electron gas become relativistic (v � c)?
1.6. Light carries momentum, so it creates pressure when it shines on something.
This has led people to propose using &ldquo;solar sails&rdquo; on interplanetary or interstellar
spacecraft.
</p>
<p>(a) Use dimensional analysis to estimate the light pressure at a distance d from a
star with luminosity L (energy per unit time).
</p>
<p>(b) Estimate the force on a solar sail with an area of 1 km2 that is 1AU from the
Sun.
</p>
<p>(c) Suppose that sail is pulling a 10 ton spacecraft. How long would it take to reach
Jupiter&rsquo;s orbit (5.2AU from the Sun)? For simplicity, assume the acceleration
remains constant even though it actually varies with distance from the star.

<p>Celestial Mechanics
</p>
<p>Patterns of motion in the sky played a significant role in the historical development
of mechanics. Briefly reviewing the history lets us see how physical concepts and
models emerged from the empirical facts.
</p>
<p>2.1 Motions in the Sky
</p>
<p>Science often begins when people notice patterns in nature and try to understand
what causes them. One well-known pattern is the daily rising and setting of the Sun,
Moon, and stars. As the stars move across the sky each night, they look for all the
world like points of light on some kind of crystalline sphere rotating around Earth.
The Sun seems to move around Earth as well, although the relative positions of
the Sun and stars vary throughout the year (the collection of visible stars changes
with the season) so there must be two different crystalline spheres. The Moon is a
little more complicated because its position and phase both change throughout the
month, but both effects can be explained by placing the Moon on a sphere of its
own. In other words, most of the obvious motions in the sky can be explained with
the intuitive notion that Earth is fixed and objects in the sky move around us. This
is the classic geocentric model of the universe.
</p>
<p>Problems arise, though, when we notice another set of motions in the sky: planets
are points of light that seem to &ldquo;wander&rdquo; among the stars.1 Ancient societies knew
of five planets (the discovery of others had to await the invention of the telescope).
Mercury and Venus always stay fairly close to the Sun, appearing either in the west
after sunset or in the east before sunrise. Jupiter and Saturn can be seen across a
much wider range of positions, moving from west to east relative to the stars from
one night to the next. Mars is a bit like Jupiter and Saturn, but with a twist. Most of

<p>Fig. 2.1 Pictures taken across several months have been combined to illustrate Mars&rsquo;s retrograde
motion. Relative to the background stars, Mars usually moves from right to left. However, from
November 15, 2007 to January 30, 2008 the planet moved from left to right, producing the loop
pattern shown here. In other cases retrograde motion can create a zigzag pattern. (Credit: Tun&ccedil;
Tezel (TWAN), reproduced by permission)
</p>
<p>the time it moves from west to east, but every once in a while Mars appears to stop,
turn around and go from east to west for a few weeks, then turn around again and
resume its &ldquo;normal&rdquo; motion (relative to the stars). Today we can see this retrograde
motion very clearly in composite photographs, as shown in Fig. 2.1.
</p>
<p>When scholars in ancient Greece tried to explain the apparent motions of
planets, they started with the assumption that the intrinsic motions involve circles.
Apollonius (c. 200 BC) constructed a model in which a planet moves on a small
circle (called an &ldquo;epicycle&rdquo;) that itself moves along a larger circle (called the
&ldquo;deferent&rdquo;). As shown in Fig. 2.2, the composite motion can allow the planet to
move backward at certain points in its orbit (depending on the relative sizes and
speeds of the epicycle and deferent; see Problem 2.1). As the measurements became
more precise, Ptolemy (c. 100 AD) refined the model by shifting the center of the
deferent away from Earth and introducing yet a different point (called the &ldquo;equant&rdquo;)
around which the angular speed was defined.2
</p>
<p>While Ptolemy&rsquo;s model was admittedly complex, its quantitative success kept it
successful well into the Renaissance. Nicolaus Copernicus (1473&ndash;1543) introduced
the first mathematically detailed alternative with the Sun at the center of motion.3
</p>
<p>2There is a common misconception that Ptolemy and his successors added more and more
epicycles. They couldn&rsquo;t; even one was hard enough to compute. See Chap. 4 of The Book Nobody
Read by Owen Gingerich [1].
3The geocentric model had been questioned much earlier by Aristarchus (c. 300 BC), but without
a fully developed alternative.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 2.2 In the geocentric model, a planet moves on an epicycle (dotted) whose center moves
along a curve called the deferent (dashed). The combined motion (solid) can cause the planet to
move backward as viewed from Earth. In the full Ptolemaic model, the deferent was not perfectly
centered on Earth
</p>
<p>In this heliocentric model, retrograde motion is an illusion that occurs when
fast-moving Earth overtakes a slower-moving outer planet (see Problem 2.2);
planets never actually move backward in space. Offering a simple explanation
of retrograde motion is not all that Copernicus&rsquo;s model had going for it. The
heliocentric model also explained why the observed planets fall into two categories:
Mercury and Venus are never seen far from the Sun because their orbits are smaller
than Earth&rsquo;s; while Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn can be seen near the Sun, on the
opposite side of the sky, or anywhere in between because their orbits are larger
than Earth&rsquo;s. Last but not least, Copernicus&rsquo;s model revealed a simple pattern in the
quantitative relation between a planet&rsquo;s distance from the Sun and its orbital period.
To Copernicus, this was a striking success: &ldquo;In no other way,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;do we find
a wonderful commensurability and a sure harmonious connection between the size
of the orbit and the planet&rsquo;s period&rdquo; (quoted by Gingerich [1, p. 54]).
</p>
<p>That said, the original heliocentric model was not without fault. Like the Greeks,
Copernicus assumed that planetary motion involved circles. While he was able to
eliminate equants and large epicycles, he still needed small epicycles to make the
model fit the data. That made Copernicus&rsquo;s model about as mathematically complex
as Ptolemy&rsquo;s, even if it was conceptually simpler.
</p>
<p>Copernicus&rsquo;s model made an important prediction: Earth moves in space. If that
is true, then our perspective on the stars should change as Earth travels from one
side of its orbit to the other (e.g., from January to July). Tycho Brahe (1546&ndash;1601),
who was perhaps the world&rsquo;s greatest naked-eye astronomer, set out to test this
prediction. He amassed years&rsquo; worth of careful measurements of planet and star</p>

</p>
<p>positions in an attempt to measure parallax, or small shifts in the apparent positions
of stars that should arise when we look from different sides of Earth&rsquo;s orbit. Tycho
failed to find clear evidence for parallax, although now we know that stars are so far
away that parallax can only be detected with a good telescope. Tycho&rsquo;s efforts did
ultimately provide support for the heliocentric model, although not in the way he
expected.
</p>
<p>Shortly before he died, Tycho hired Johannes Kepler (1571&ndash;1630) as an assistant.
Kepler combed through Tycho&rsquo;s measurements of planet positions and tried to
find a geometric model to explain the motion. He initially adopted Copernicus&rsquo;s
heliocentric model with circular orbits modified by epicycles. Kepler found, though,
that the model could not quite reproduce Tycho&rsquo;s high-quality data, notably for
Mars. Once he considered more general forms of motion, Kepler discovered that he
could fit the data using elliptical orbits. Working through the details, he eventually
extracted three laws of planetary motion:
</p>
<p>I. Planets move in elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus.
II. A line that connects a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 2.3).
III. A planet&rsquo;s orbital period P (in years) and average distance from the Sun a
</p>
<p>(in AU) are related by P 2 D a3.
Suddenly the heliocentric model had an attractive and powerful quantitative frame-
work. Still, people continued to struggle with the notion of a moving Earth.
</p>
<p>That situation finally began to change thanks to the work of Galileo Galilei
(1564&ndash;1642), who was arguably the first great experimental physicist. Using the
newly-invented telescope, Galileo made two key discoveries related to planetary
motion. First, he observed that Venus has phases just like the Moon. In the
geocentric model, Venus would always stay between Earth and the Sun so it could</p>

<p>Fig. 2.4 Phases of Venus in the heliocentric model (not to scale). Full and gibbous phases can
occur only if Venus travels to the far side of the Sun
</p>
<p>only have new and crescent phases. Galileo saw that Venus has quarter and gibbous
phases as well, which implies that Venus can go &ldquo;behind&rdquo; the Sun (as seen from
Earth; see Fig. 2.4). In other words, if we know that Venus is closer to the Sun than
Earth is, and the planet has a full cycle of phases, then it must orbit the Sun. Second,
Galileo discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter. While this did not directly prove
that planets orbit the Sun, it did demonstrate that objects can orbit something other
than Earth. On the basis of his evidence, Galileo argued strongly in favor of the
heliocentric model, most famously in his book Dialogue on the Two Chief World
Systems. The work violated dictates from the Catholic Church, causing the book to
be banned by the Roman Inquisition and Galileo to be placed under house arrest.
More than three and a half centuries later, Pope John Paul II renounced the Church&rsquo;s
condemnation of Galileo.
</p>
<p>2.2 Laws of Motion
</p>
<p>All of those ideas set the stage for Isaac Newton (1642&ndash;1727) to devise the fields
we now know as theoretical physics and calculus (among other accomplishments).
In 1665, Newton graduated from Cambridge but the university then closed because
of the plague. He went home and, working alone, entered a period of remarkable
intellectual creativity.4 Newton started with mathematics, inventing the idea of
</p>
<p>4Historical aside: In 1665&ndash;1666 Newton solved the problems of motion and gravity to his
satisfaction, keeping a detailed notebook but not publishing his work. In 1684, Edmund Halley
visited Newton to pose the question: If gravity has an inverse square force law, what curve
will a planet follow? Newton knew the answer was an ellipse (see Sect. 3.1), but only after
battling Robert Hooke for some time did he finally decide to write his famous work Philosophiae
Naturalis Principia Mathematica, or &ldquo;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.&rdquo; Newton&rsquo;s
introduction of mathematical principles was profoundly important for the further development of
physics and astrophysics. See Isaac Newton by James Gleick [2] for more about the life and work
of this fascinating figure.</p>

</p>
<p>plotting solutions of equations as curves (a topic now known as algebraic geometry).
He developed calculus so he could analyze curves, using derivatives to represent
tangent lines and integrals to compute areas. Then Newton began to think about
curves representing trajectories of objects in motion. Before he could apply his
mathematical tools to motion, though, Newton had to introduce some new physical
concepts that became his famous laws of motion:
</p>
<p>I. Inertia. An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line
unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
</p>
<p>II. Force and acceleration. A net force acting on an object produces an acceler-
ation in the same direction as the applied force. The acceleration and force are
related by
</p>
<p>F D ma D m dv
dt
</p>
<p>(2.1)
</p>
<p>III. Equal/opposite reaction. If object #1 exerts a force on object #2, then object
#2 exerts an equal and opposite force back on object #1: F12 D �F21.
</p>
<p>These laws are general; they are not specific to planets. In fact, to explain planetary
motion Newton had to add one more law specifying the force. We will come to the
law of gravity in Sect. 2.3.
</p>
<p>While they are often introduced as above, Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion can be
restated in terms of quantities that do not change with time. Think of a rod: the
.x; y; z/ coordinates of the endpoints depend on whether the rod is moving or
rotating, but the distance between the two endpoints is always the same. A quantity
that is &ldquo;conserved&rdquo; is usually thought to represent some fundamental property of
a system (such as the length of the rod). Stating physical theories in terms of
conservation laws can often help us find the simplest expressions of those theories.
Let&rsquo;s see a few examples that are probably familiar but nonetheless valuable.
</p>
<p>Momentum is defined by
</p>
<p>p � mv
</p>
<p>We can use this to rewrite Eq. (2.1) as
</p>
<p>F D dp
dt
</p>
<p>While this might seem trivial, it is actually a nice generalization of Newton&rsquo;s
second law. It helps us see that when there is no net force, momentum does not
change. Thus, Newton&rsquo;s first law is fundamentally a statement of conservation of
momentum.
</p>
<p>Angular momentum is defined by
</p>
<p>L � r � p D m.r � v/ (2.2)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Laws of Motion 27
</p>
<p>We will sometimes use the specific angular momentum, defined to be the angular
momentum per unit mass:
</p>
<p>` � L
m
</p>
<p>D r � v (2.3)
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the derivative of angular momentum with respect to time:
</p>
<p>dL
</p>
<p>dt
D dr
</p>
<p>dt
� p C r � dp
</p>
<p>dt
</p>
<p>D v � .m v/ C r � F
D r � F
</p>
<p>(The cross product of a vector with itself is zero, so the first term vanishes.) Clearly
if there is no net force then angular momentum is conserved. More interesting is a
situation in which the force is purely radial, F D F.r/ Or. In this case,
</p>
<p>dL
</p>
<p>dt
D r � ŒF .r/ Or&#141; D 0
</p>
<p>We see that if a force is applied but there is no angular component to the force, then
angular momentum is conserved.
</p>
<p>Energy. If a force acts on an object, it takes &ldquo;work&rdquo; to move the object against
the force. The amount of work required to go from some initial position ri to final
position rf can be calculated as
</p>
<p>&#129;U D �
Z rf
</p>
<p>ri
</p>
<p>F � dr (2.4)
</p>
<p>We call this potential energy because it is energy that would be released if the
object were to move back to the initial position. We include a minus sign because
the work acts against the force F, and we write &#129;U to emphasize that this is an
energy difference. If desired, we can pick a reference point at which the potential is
defined to be zero and thus obtain a potential energy function U.r/. Then Eq. (2.4)
can be inverted to say the force is obtained by differentiating the potential energy:
</p>
<p>F D �rU (2.5)
</p>
<p>(This is independent of the choice of zeropoint because any additive constant
vanishes in the derivative.) Now let&rsquo;s return to Eq. (2.4) and use Newton&rsquo;s second
law along with v D dr=dt to see what we can learn:

<p>&#129;U D �

</p>
<p>Toward the end we identify K D .1=2/m v2 as the kinetic energy, or energy of
motion. Trivially rewriting the final equation gives
</p>
<p>&#129;U C&#129;K D 0
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>&#129;Etot D 0 where Etot D U CK
</p>
<p>This is the statement of conservation of energy. Note that potential and kinetic
energy are not separately conserved; in fact, one can be traded for the other. But
the combination&mdash;the total energy&mdash;is conserved. This is true for any force, at least
in the context of Newtonian physics.
</p>
<p>2.3 Law of Gravity
</p>
<p>In order to apply his general laws of motion to planets, Newton had to specify
the force that acts on planets to generate their motion. We saw in Chap. 1 how he
used Kepler&rsquo;s third law to motivate the inverse square law form. To give a precise
formulation, let&rsquo;s suppose that an object of massM exerts a gravitational force on
a second object of mass m whose position relative to the first object is given by
the vector r. If the objects are both point masses, Newton&rsquo;s law of gravity in vector
form reads
</p>
<p>Fgrav.r/ D �
GMm
</p>
<p>r2
Or (2.6)
</p>
<p>where Or reminds us that the force is radial, and the minus signs indicates that gravity
is an attractive force.
</p>
<p>What if the two objects are not point masses? One of Newton&rsquo;s triumphs was to
show that the gravitational force outside a spherically symmetric object of mass
M is the same as that from a point mass M at the center of the object. Also,
the gravitational force inside a spherical shell is zero. To understand these results,
consider the setup in Fig. 2.5. Let&rsquo;s use spherical coordinates5 but modify them

<p>This is also the potential energy outside any spherical object with total mass M .
As noted above, we must pick a reference point in order to define the full potential

<p>This function is independent of m, so it describes the gravitational field aroundM

consider:

</p>
<p>All objects at a given position in the gravitational field of M experience the same
acceleration, regardless of their mass.
</p>
<p>If we focus attention near the surface of Earth (as in introductory physics
courses), it may be convenient to adopt a different convention and let the reference

<p>In the next chapter we will see how Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion and gravity come
together to explain Kepler&rsquo;s laws. First, though, it is useful to do a short example
that illustrates how conservation laws can help us analyze certain problems quickly
and easily.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What goes up must come down,&rdquo; according to the common saying, but Newton
begged to differ. He discerned that the force causing an apple to fall from a tree is
the same force keeping the Moon in orbit around Earth; the key difference is that
the Moon&rsquo;s forward motion keeps it from crashing into the ground. In principle,
if we could throw an apple hard enough we could give it enough motion to go up</p>

<p>Fig. 2.6 The solid curve shows the gravitational potential energy; the dashed horizontal line
shows the total energy (which is conserved); and the difference between the two gives the kinetic
energy. Since kinetic energy cannot be negative, the object can never go beyond rmax
</p>
<p>and never come back down. (This works better with rockets than apples.) How hard
would we have to throw it?
</p>
<p>To find out, suppose an object with massm is at radius r and moving with speed
v in the gravitational field around mass M . Is there any limit on how far the small
object can go? If so, what is the maximum radius (rmax) it can reach? How fast do
we need to make the object move if we want it to escape?
</p>
<p>If we wanted to work with the original version of Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion,
we would have to solve the differential equation d2r=dt2 D �.GM=r2/Or for all
trajectories that originate at radius r with speed v, and then we would have to search
among those trajectories to find rmax. That does not sound like a simple task. But the
analysis gets much easier if we turn to conservation of energy. At any given r , the
total energy is the sum of the potential and kinetic terms,

</p>
<p>We can think about this in terms of an energy diagram as in Fig. 2.6. The total energy
must be independent of radius. Since the kinetic term is non-negative, the potential
energy can never exceed the total energy. The maximum allowed radius is the place
where the kinetic energy vanishes and the potential energy equals the total energy,
</p>
<p>E D �GMm

<p>Notice that we reached this answer in just three lines of algebra; we did not have to
specify the direction of motion or examine specific trajectories, or deal with vectors
and differential equations at all. Applying conservation of energy is a powerful
approach to this problem.
</p>
<p>We can now ask how fast the object would have to be moving when it is at radius
r in order to escape the gravitational field altogether. This is the speed that allows
rmax to become infinity, and it is given by the value of v that causes the quantity in
parentheses in Eq. (2.16) to vanish:

<p>2.1. Consider a geocentric model for retrograde motion. Suppose the deferent has
radius R and angular speed ˝ , while the epicycle has radius a &lt; R and angular
speed ! (about its center). Find the velocity vector in polar coordinates centered on
Earth. By analyzing the tangential velocity at the innermost points, show that the
condition to have retrograde motion is a! &gt; R˝ .
</p>
<p>2.2. Here is a way to understand retrograde motion in the heliocentric model using
geometric reasoning (no equations required). Consider a system with two planets
orbiting the Sun along circles in the same plane. Suppose the outer planet takes
twice as long as the inner planet to orbit the star. Let t D 0 be the time when the
two planets are lined up on one side of the star.
</p>
<p>(a) Sketch the orbits, and add some distant stars. Suppose both planets orbit and
spin in the counterclockwise direction. Indicate the directions in the star field
that an observer on the inner planet would identify as &ldquo;east&rdquo; and &ldquo;west.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>(b) Sketch the positions of the planets a little before and after t D 0. In which
direction across the sky does the outer planet appear to move, as viewed from
the inner planet?
</p>
<p>(c) Repeat part (b) at times when the planets are not lined up (for example, when
the inner planet has completed 1/4 or 1/2 of its orbit).
</p>
<p>2.3. To practice/reviewworkingwith vectors, compute the specific angular momen-
tum for straight line motion r.t/ D vt Ox C b Oy. Is angular momentum conserved?
Should it be?
</p>
<p>2.4. Consider conservation of energy and angular momentum as applied to an
elliptical orbit.
</p>
<p>(a) At what point in an elliptical orbit does a planet move fastest? Slowest?</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>(b) Sketch the kinetic and potential energies as a function of time for a planet in an
elliptical orbit.
</p>
<p>2.5. Consider a uniform sphere with mass M and radius R. Compute the gravita-
tional force on a particle of mass m at any radius 0 &lt; r &lt; 1. Then compute the
corresponding gravitational potential. You make take the potential to be zero at the
center of the sphere.
</p>
<p>2.6. Consider a particle of mass m released from rest at a distance r0 from a point
massM (and assumeM � m soM does not move). Use conservation of energy to
find the speed v, which is also dr=dt . Then compute the acceleration and show that
the motion satisfies Newton&rsquo;s laws.
</p>
<p>2.7. For a sufficiently small object, compute the radius at which the escape velocity
equals the speed of light. Since nothing can go faster than the speed of light, this
is the &ldquo;Schwarzschild radius&rdquo; for the event horizon of a black hole. What is the
Schwarzschild radius of a black hole the mass of Earth? Of the Sun?
</p>
<p>2.8. Could you jump off an asteroid? Let&rsquo;s find out.
</p>
<p>(a) Estimate the velocity you achieve when you jump straight up on Earth. Hint:
use the height you reach to estimate the change in your potential energy, and
then use conservation of energy to estimate your initial kinetic energy.
</p>
<p>(b) Now estimate the size of the largest asteroid you could escape from by jumping.
You will need to make an assumption about the asteroid&rsquo;s density; just explain
your reasoning.

</p>
<p>Gravitational One-Body Problem
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion and gravity come together to explain the motion of planets
around the Sun, plus a wide range of other astrophysical systems. In this chapter we
study systems in which the source of gravity (e.g., the Sun) is stationary and a single
object (e.g., a planet) is in motion. While Newton&rsquo;s third law tells us that a planet&rsquo;s
gravitational pull must also cause the Sun to move, the Sun is so muchmore massive
than any of its planets that its motion can be neglected as a first approximation.
In Chap. 4 we will generalize to the case in which both objects move.
</p>
<p>3.1 Deriving Kepler&rsquo;s Laws
</p>
<p>Kepler&rsquo;s laws provide a great way to analyze orbital motion, since they are already
focused on relevant properties of orbits, but in their initial form they were purely
empirical and limited to motion around the Sun. If we can use Newton&rsquo;s laws to
justify and generalize Kepler&rsquo;s, then we can use the latter to analyze orbital motion
in a wide range of settings.
</p>
<p>Since Kepler taught us to work with ellipses, we begin by reviewing their
geometry. An ellipse is specified mathematically as the solution of the equation
</p>
<p>x2
</p>
<p>a2
C y
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>b2
D 1 (3.1)
</p>
<p>We can assume a &gt; b without loss of generality, so Eq. (3.1) is written in a
coordinate system where the long or &ldquo;major&rdquo; axis of the ellipse is along the x-axis,
while the short or &ldquo;minor&rdquo; axis is along the y-axis. There are two special points
inside the ellipse called foci (plural of focus) that are a distance c D
</p>
<p>p
a2 � b2 from
</p>
<p>the center along the major axis. They are special because the combined distance to
the two foci is constant along the ellipse. We define the eccentricity of an ellipse to
be the dimensionless ratio e D c=a, such that a circle has e D 0 and more elongated

the major axis, and the foci (points) are located a distance ae from the center. The area of the
ellipse is A D �a2.1 � e2/1=2. In the text we use polar coordinates .r; �/ centered on one focus.
The pericenter and apocenter distances are indicated: rp D a.1� e/ and ra D a.1C e/
</p>
<p>ellipses have higher eccentricities up to the limit e D 1. Using the eccentricity we
can rewrite b D a
</p>
<p>p

</p>
<p>.a; e/ instead of .a; b/.
Kepler also taught us that the Sun is at one focus of an elliptical orbit, so if we

<p>introduce polar coordinates .r; �/ centered on the Sun then we have (see Fig. 3.1)

</p>
<p>then we see that Eq. (3.5) says angular momentum is conserved (also see Sect. 2.2).

(3.8)
</p>
<p>If the right-hand side were zero, this would be the equation for a simple harmonic
oscillator and the solution would have the form u0 D B cos� where B is some
constant. To deal with the constant on the right-hand side, we just need to add
GM=`2 to u0 (which works because the constant does not affect the derivative term).
In other words, the solution has the form u D B cos� C GM=`2. Without loss of
generality, we can define a new constant e such that B D GMe=`2 and our final
solution is

<p>Comparing with Eq. (3.2), we see that this curve describes an ellipse, and the

<p>To examine Kepler&rsquo;s second law, we need to consider the area dA swept out by a
planet&rsquo;s motion in some small time interval dt . From the geometry shown in Fig. 3.2,
the area is

</p>
<p>This is constant because angular momentum is conserved. Thus, Kepler&rsquo;s second
law is a direct consequence of the fact that gravity is a central force.</p>

<p>I. The orbit is an ellipse because that shape is the solution of Newton&rsquo;s laws of
motion under the influence of an inverse square gravitational force.
</p>
<p>II. The rate at which area is swept out is constant because of conservation of
angular momentum, which holds because gravity is a central force.

<p>III. The relation P 2 / a3 holds because gravity has an inverse square force law.</p>

</p>
<p>3.2 Using Kepler III: Motion ! Mass
</p>
<p>With Newton&rsquo;s generalization, Kepler&rsquo;s third law becomes a powerful principle for
astrophysics. Rearranging Eq. (3.14), we can write
</p>
<p>M D 4�
2a3
</p>
<p>GP 2
(3.15)
</p>
<p>This form is notable because the right-hand side involves quantities we can
measure&mdash;the size and period of an orbit&mdash;while the left-hand side is something we
maywant to know&mdash;themass of an astrophysical object. As we explore applications,
we will encounter a number of practical challenges (mostly related to measuring a
accurately), but the fundamental principle remains valid: if we can observe motion
and interpret it using Newton&rsquo;s laws, we can infer mass. Mass is a key property
of astronomical systems that is difficult to measure directly, so the motion!mass
principle is valuable in a wide range of contexts.
</p>
<p>3.2.1 The Black Hole at the Center of the Milky Way
</p>
<p>At the center of the MilkyWay galaxy is a compact source known as Sagittarius A�
</p>
<p>(often abbreviated as Sgr A�) that emits light across the electromagnetic spectrum.
At radio wavelengths, high-resolution observations have constrained the size to be
.0.3AU [1]. At X-ray wavelengths corresponding to photon energies2 between 2
and 10 keV, the luminosity is greater than 1026 J s�1 [2]. What could be so energetic
yet compact?
</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1990s, powerful telescopes and clever observational techniques
made it possible to resolve individual stars in the Galactic Center, as shown in
Fig. 3.3. Dedicated observers discovered that the stars are moving, mapped the
motions, and ultimately found that the orbits appear to be ellipses with Sgr A� as a
common focus. In other words, the stars orbiting Sgr A� form a Keplerian system
that is directly analogous to the planets orbiting the Sun.
</p>
<p>We can therefore use the motion!mass principle to measure the mass of
Sgr A�. Stars #2, 16, and 19 (labeled in Fig. 3.3) are particularly important because
they have been tracked long enough to pass pericenter, so their orbits are well
constrained. Fitting ellipses to the motion yields the following orbital parameters
(taken from Ghez et al. [3]; see Gillessen et al. [4] for updated data):
</p>
<p>Star P (yr) a (AU) rp (AU)
</p>
<p>2 14.53 919 122
16 36 1,680 45
19 37.3 1,720 287

relation E D h� D hc=�.</p>

<p>Applying Eq. (3.15) to star #2 yields

</p>
<p>D 7:3 � 1036 kg
D 3:7 � 106Mˇ
</p>
<p>Repeating the analysis for other stars gives consistent results. In other words, from
the motions of stars we conclude that there is an object with nearly four million
times the mass of the Sun lying at the center of the Milky Way. From the radio and
X-ray observations, and the pericenter distances, we know this object is luminous
and compact. What could it be? The only plausible answer is a black hole&mdash;indeed,
a supermassive black hole (SMBH).
</p>
<p>At this point you may have some questions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Why did we treat this as a one-body problem?
The black hole is even moremassive relative to the stars than the Sun is compared
to the planets, so its reflex motion is negligible.
</p>
<p>&bull; Could Sgr A� be anything other than a black hole?
Could it be a single star? No: in Chap. 16 we will see that there is no way for a
single star to be anywhere near this massive. Could it be a cluster of stars? Again,
no: in Sect. 3.3.2 below we will see that such a massive and compact star cluster
would &ldquo;evaporate&rdquo; due to stellar dynamical effects.</p>
<p/>

<p>42 3 Gravitational One-Body Problem
</p>
<p>&bull; If it is a black hole, why haven&rsquo;t we used relativity?

comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole. For Sgr A� this is

a reasonable approximation to the motion.
</p>
<p>&bull; Can we see the event horizon?

black hole&rsquo;s event horizon is (using the small-angle approximation)

<p>At optical wavelengths, the best resolution that can be achieved today is
0.05&ndash;0.1 arcsec (with the Hubble Space Telescope, or adaptive optics from the
ground). At radio wavelengths, it is possible to use an array of telescopes with a
technique called interferometry to achieve a resolution of 10�4 arcsec or better.
While observations have not directly revealed the event horizon, they do seem to
be on the verge of resolving some of the interesting structure in Sgr A� [1].

<p>3.2.2 Supermassive Black Holes in Other Galaxies
</p>
<p>Our galaxy is not the only one with a supermassive black hole at the center;
evidence is growing that every massive galaxy hosts such an object. In most cases
we cannot study the black holes in as much detail as Sgr A�, but we can still use the
motion!mass principle to infer their masses.

<p>masers3 orbiting the center of the galaxy. While the orbital period is too long for
us to see the masers shift position, we can still measure motion. Masers emit light
at very specific wavelengths, but if they are moving toward or away from us the
emission is shifted to shorter or longer wavelengths by the Doppler effect. For non-
relativistic motion, the shift in wavelength is&#129;�=�e D v=c where �e is the emitted
wavelength, and v is the component of velocity along the line of sight with the
convention that v &gt; 0 if the object is moving away from us and v &lt; 0 if it is moving
toward us. (See Sect. 10.2.4 for a full discussion of the relativistic Doppler effect.)
Figure 3.4 shows that masers closer to the center of NGC 4258 move faster, and the
motion is consistent with orbits around an object with mass .3:9˙0:1/�107Mˇ [6].

although &ldquo;microwave&rdquo; is now sometimes replaced by &ldquo;molecular.&rdquo; A laser is similar to a maser
except that it operates in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (the &ldquo;l&rdquo; stands for
&ldquo;light,&rdquo; specifically meaning visible light).</p>

<p>The current upper limit on the size of the object is 0:16 pc, so the size constraint is
not nearly as strong as for Sgr A�. Nevertheless, astronomers believe the central
object is a black hole.

<p>NGC 4374
</p>
<p>At present there are no other galaxies where we can observe individual objects
moving around the center of the galaxy. Still, we can measure collections of stars or
gas moving around in the centers of many galaxies. As an example, Fig. 3.5 shows
an optical spectrum of the galaxy NGC 4374. The light from stars and gas on one
side of the galaxy center is shifted toward bluer wavelengths by the Doppler effect,
while the light from stars and gas on the other side of the center is shifted toward
redder wavelengths. Also, objects closer to the center move faster. The motion again
reveals a central massive object, this time with a mass of nearly 9 � 108Mˇ [7].

<p>A Supermassive Black Hole in Every Galaxy?

<p>Similar observations in other galaxies have shown that whenever we can make
good measurements we find evidence for supermassive black holes. Astronomers

<p>the Sun. What&rsquo;s more, the mass of the black hole appears to be closely related to the
properties of the galaxy in which it resides.
</p>
<p>We will study galaxies later (in Chaps. 7 and 8), but for now we note that most
galaxies can be described in terms of two types of structures: a flat disk in which the
star orbits lie mostly in a plane; and a rounder spheroid in which the star orbits have
random orientations. Spiral galaxies usually have large disks surrounding smaller
spheroids known as bulges, while elliptical galaxies are pure spheroids. Since the
motion in spheroids is random, we characterize it by examining the distribution
of star velocities (strictly speaking, the component along the line of sight) and
computing the statistical standard deviation, which we call the velocity dispersion.
</p>
<p>A striking discovery about supermassive black holes is that the black hole mass
is correlated with the velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component of its host
galaxy, as shown in Fig. 3.6. You may wonder: why should it be remarkable that
motion (�) is closely related to mass (M )? Most of the stars used to measure
the velocity dispersion lie far enough from the black hole that they should hardly
notice its gravity.4 Yet the stars seem to know how much the black hole weighs&mdash;
or, conversely, the black hole knows how fast the stars move. Astronomers are still

<p>4We quantify this idea in terms of a gravitational &ldquo;sphere of influence&rdquo; in Sect. 3.3.1.</p>

<p>trying to understand how this came to be: observers are trying to see whether the
M -� relation was the same in the past, while theorists are trying to understand
whether the processes by which black holes and spheroids grow might be related to
one another. The final answers are not known, but the discovery of theM -� relation
has sparked a lot of new research.
</p>
<p>3.2.3 Active Galactic Nuclei
</p>
<p>Direct motion-based measurements of black hole masses can be made only in
relatively nearby galaxies, where we can resolve the motion on small scales.
Nevertheless, strong indirect evidence suggests that supermassive black holes are
common in galaxies throughout the universe.
</p>
<p>The evidence comes from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)&mdash;an umbrella term for
galaxies that emit huge amounts of energy from their centers. There are many types
of AGN but for our purposes there are two key features. First, these objects can be
very luminous, reaching L � 1012Lˇ. Second, AGN can vary on time scales as
short as &#129;t � 1 h. The variability lets us place an upper limit on the size, because a
source can change coherently only if information about the physical conditions can
travel across the source. If we imagine that something changes in the middle of the
source, the time it would take for that information to reach the edge is &#129;t &amp; R=c
(and perhaps much longer if the information propagates at less than the speed of
light). If &#129;t � 1 h then we can infer
</p>
<p>R . c &#129;t � 3:0 � 108ms�1 � 3;600 s � 1012m � 7AU
</p>
<p>In other words, an AGN can be as bright as a galaxy, but smaller than the Solar
System! What might be so energetic? A supermassive black hole.
</p>
<p>You may ask: Aren&rsquo;t black holes supposed to be black? How can they emit so
much energy? While nothing can escape a black hole once it has fallen in, a lot of
energy can be emitted as matter approaches a black hole. Imagine mass falling in
at a rate PM D dM=dt . In time dt , an amount PM dt falls into the black hole, and as
it falls from infinity to the event horizon it releases potential energy
</p>
<p>dU � �GM
Rs
</p>
<p>PM dt
</p>
<p>(We will use Newtonian gravity for this simple estimate.) As atoms fall in, their
kinetic energy must increase to conserve energy. As they speed up, they bump into
one another more and more often, causing the gas to heat up and radiate. If all the
potential energy that was liberated gets converted to light, the total luminosity (light
energy per unit time) could be as large as

<p>3.3 Related Concepts 47
</p>
<p>As mass falls into a black hole, a significant fraction of its rest mass energy could
be converted into light.
</p>
<p>There are some caveats. The energy release is probably gradual; it does not all
happen at the event horizon. Some of the energy might even vanish into the black
hole. Also, a proper analysis should account for relativity. Detailed analyses indicate
that the energy release has the form (e.g., [10])
</p>
<p>L � " PM c2
</p>
<p>where the &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; is " � 0:06 � 0:42 and " � 0:1 is a typical value. Even so,
it is fair to say that black holes are the most efficient machines in the universe for
converting mass into energy.5
</p>
<p>3.3 Related Concepts
</p>
<p>Let us briefly step away from the main story to address two topics that arose
in Sect. 3.2. The notion of a gravitational sphere of influence is important for
interpreting the M -� relation, and it is an interesting variant of the one-body
problem. The concept of stellar dynamical evaporation is important for interpreting
constraints on supermassive black holes (particularly Sgr A�), and it provides a nice
application of dimensional analysis.
</p>
<p>3.3.1 Sphere of Influence
</p>
<p>In Sect. 3.2.2 we mentioned that astronomers were surprised to find a tight relation
between the masses of supermassive black holes and the velocity dispersions of
the spheroids in which they are embedded. Why was that a surprise? To find out,
let&rsquo;s estimate the size of the region in which a black hole has a significant influence
on the motions of stars. To be more specific, let&rsquo;s define a black hole&rsquo;s &ldquo;sphere of
influence&rdquo; to be the region where the gravity from the black hole is stronger than
the gravity from the rest of the matter in the galaxy. At radius r , the strength of the
gravitational force from the black hole is
</p>
<p>Fbh.r/ D
GMbhm
</p>
<p>r2
</p>
<p>What about the force from the galaxy? For simplicity, let&rsquo;s assume the galaxy is
spherically symmetric. From Eq. (2.11), the force is then

<p>These distances are very small comparedwith the size of a galaxy (which is typically

enough mass compared with its galaxy to have a strong effect on the entire galaxy.</p>

<p>3.3 Related Concepts 49
</p>
<p>The M -� relation must arise from some indirect connection between the way
galaxies form and the way supermassive black holes grow inside galaxies.
</p>
<p>3.3.2 Stellar Dynamical Evaporation
</p>
<p>In Sect. 3.2.1 we learned that stellar motions reveal Sgr A� to be massive and
compact, but they do not definitively prove it to be a black hole, so we should
consider alternatives. We said it cannot be a single star, but could it be a cluster
of stars?
</p>
<p>If millions of stars are confined to a small space, they will occasionally pass
very close to each other. Since gravity gets strong when separations get small, close
interactions can impart enough force to eject one of the stars from the cluster. Let&rsquo;s
use dimensional analysis to estimate the time it would take for a star cluster to
&ldquo;evaporate&rdquo; in this way.6 Suppose there are N stars of mass m (so the total mass
isM D Nm), in a region of size R. For dimensional analysis, what do we have to
work with?

<p>We need G�1=2 to get a time, and then we need R3=2 to eliminate length. We have a
choice of mass:M orm. Since the evaporation interactions involve individual stars,
I think the key mass ism. There may also be some factor that depends on the number
of stars N ; we will come back to that in a moment. To this point, our analysis of
dimensions gives a guess of the form
</p>
<p>tevap �
R3=2
</p>
<p>.Gm/1=2
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider the number of stars. I imagine that there are two places
where N enters. First, since stars are ejected one by one the time it takes to
evaporate the cluster should have a factor of N . Second, if we pack more stars
into a fixed space, gravity will be stronger, and the stars will move faster. That
will cause interactions to happen more quickly, decreasing the evaporation time.
In Problem 1.1 you used dimensional analysis to estimate the typical velocity
of stars in a gravitationally bound system; the upshot is that speed scales as

Incorporating both of these factors yields

<p>Let&rsquo;s plug in numbers. Our mass estimate for Sgr A� isM D 3:7�106Mˇ. Strictly
speaking, all we know from the motion is that the mass is confined within a region
R &lt; 45AU. If we assume all stars are like the Sun, we have m �Mˇ. Then:

</p>
<p>While this estimate from dimensional analysis may be fairly crude, it certainly
indicates that if Sgr A� were a cluster of normal stars it would have evaporated
long ago.
</p>
<p>We are left with the conclusion that Sgr A� is probably a black hole. Even
though we have not yet detected the event horizon&mdash;that is the holy grail of black
hole studies&mdash;we have assembled a strong case in which the Kepler&rsquo;s laws and the
motion!mass principle have played a key role.

<p>Gravitational Two-Body Problem
</p>
<p>Now we are ready to study what happens when two objects interact via gravity
and both are free to move. As we will see, there is a deep connection between
the one-body and two-body problems that provides a powerful opportunity to
understand binary star systems and extrasolar planets.
</p>
<p>4.1 Equivalent One-Body Problem
</p>
<p>Our first task is to solve the equations of motion and find the orbits in the two-
body problem. We can do this by uncovering a mathematical equivalence with the
one-body problem, which we have already solved.
</p>
<p>4.1.1 Setup
</p>
<p>Consider the gravitational interaction between mass m1 at position r1 and mass m2
at position r2, as sketched in Fig. 4.1. Introducing a few new quantities will clarify
our analysis. Define the separation vector,
</p>
<p>r D r2 � r1 (4.1)
</p>
<p>and the center of mass position,
</p>
<p>R D m1r1 Cm2r2
m1 Cm2
</p>
<p>(4.2)
</p>
<p>Also define the total mass,
</p>
<p>M D m1 Cm2 (4.3)

<p>As defined, the total and reduced masses obey the product relation

</p>
<p>With these definitions, we can rewrite the positions as

</p>

</p>
<p>m2

</p>
<p>Notice that the two objects are always on opposite sides of the center of mass. While
this should be apparent from the term &ldquo;center,&rdquo; it is a good point to keep in mind
when visualizing motion in the two-body problem.
</p>
<p>Intuitively, the gravitational force on object #1 should point toward object #2,
which means the force vector F1 is parallel to the separation vector r. The force on
object #2 points in the opposite direction, so F2 has the opposite sign. Newton&rsquo;s law
of gravity tells us that both forces have strength Gm1m2=r2. Putting these pieces
together, we can write the forces as
</p>
<p>force on #1: F1 D C
Gm1m2

Or (4.7a)
</p>
<p>force on #2: F2 D �

<p>4.1.2 Motion
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first consider the acceleration of the center of mass:</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>F1 C F2
�
</p>
<p>D 0
</p>
<p>In the first step we replace R using Eq. (4.2). In the second step we use Newton&rsquo;s
second law to putmi d2ri=dt2 D Fi , and in the third step we use Newton&rsquo;s third law
(in the form of 4.7). We learn that the center of mass does not accelerate.
</p>
<p>Thereforewe can define an inertial referencewith the center of mass at the origin,
so R D 0. Shifting to this center of mass frame for the remainder of the analysis,
we can write
</p>
<p>r1 D �
�
</p>
<p>m1
r and r2 D
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>m2
r (4.8)
</p>
<p>Note that when we deal with vectors, r1 and r2 have opposite signs, and the
separation vector still includes a minus sign: r D r2� r1. But if we just consider the
lengths of vectors, we know the length of the separation vector is (not surprisingly)
the sum of the lengths of r1 and r2:
</p>
<p>jrj D jr1j C jr2j
</p>
<p>The ratio of lengths is interesting:
</p>
<p>jr2j
jr1j
</p>
<p>D m1
m2
</p>
<p>(4.9)
</p>
<p>Even before we fully characterize the motion, we realize that the orbits of the two
objects are scaled versions of one another, with the scaling given by the (inverse)
mass ratio.
</p>
<p>To analyze the motion in detail, consider the equation of motion for object #1:
</p>
<p>m1
d2r1
dt2
</p>
<p>D F1
</p>
<p>�� d
2r
</p>
<p>dt2
D Gm1m2
</p>
<p>r2
Or
</p>
<p>) d
2r
</p>
<p>dt2
D �GM
</p>
<p>r2
Or (4.10)
</p>
<p>We first use Eq. (4.8) for r1 and Eq. (4.7a) for F1, and then use Eq. (4.5) to replace
m1m2. Considering object #2 yields the same equation. This equation should look
familiar: it is the equation of motion for the gravitational one-body problem. The key
lesson is that a two-body problem with masses m1 and m2 is mathematically
equivalent to a one-body problem with mass M D m1 Cm2.</p>

<p>Fig. 4.2 Sample two-body problem with a 2:1 mass ratio and eccentricity e D 0:6 (right) and the
equivalent one-body problem (left). The two-body orbits are scaled down versions of the one-body
ellipse, with the same eccentricity. They share a common focus at the center of mass of the system
(denoted by �). As the separation vector sweeps around, it is pinned at the center of mass
</p>
<p>We know from Eq. (3.9) that the solution to the one-body problem has the form

<p>r D
a
�
</p>
<p>1 � e2
�
</p>
<p>1C e cos� (4.11)
</p>
<p>We can then use Eq. (4.8) to say that the orbits for the two-body problem are smaller
ellipses with semimajor axes

<p>a1 D
�
</p>
<p>m1
a and a2 D
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>m2
a (4.12)
</p>
<p>The orbits are arranged so the two ellipses share a common focus (at the center
of mass) and the two objects always lie on opposite sides of the center of mass.
The association between a two-body problem and its equivalent one-body analog is
illustrated in Fig. 4.2.
</p>
<p>As we use the one-body analogy, we need to keep in mind that it is a math-
ematical connection more than a physical one. It is not correct to say that a
problem with masses m1 and m2 orbiting each other is physically equivalent to a
problem with masses M and � orbiting each other. The issue is that a physical
scenario with massesM and � would itself be a two-body problem so both objects
would move, but the mathematical equivalence is to a one-body problem in which
M is stationary. The analogy between the two-body and one-body problems is
powerful, but it must be used with some care.
</p>
<p>4.1.3 Energy and Angular Momentum
</p>
<p>We have seen the analogy with the equation of motion, but does it extend to energy
and angular momentum? Let&rsquo;s start with kinetic energy. Equation (4.8) implies that
the velocity vectors are related by</p>

</p>
<p>r

</p>
<p>where we use Eq. (4.4) to simplify the first term. A similar analysis of the angular
momentum yields

<p>�2 r � v
</p>
<p>D � r � v (4.15)
</p>
<p>The analogy continues to be useful: the final expressions for both energy and angular
momentum have forms appropriate for an object of mass � orbiting a (stationary)
object of massM in a one-body problem.
</p>
<p>4.1.4 Velocity Curve
</p>
<p>Equation (4.13) gives general relations for the velocity, but it is worthwhile to dig
into the details because a lot of what we can learn about binary stars and exoplanets</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58 4 Gravitational Two-Body Problem
</p>
<p>comes from analyzing velocities. We focus here on v for the one-body problem,
since v1 and v2 can be obtained from it. To begin, we find the components of v in
polar coordinates. The angular component is
</p>

<p>dt
D `

<p>r
D `.1C e cos�/
</p>
<p>a.1 � e2/ (4.16)
</p>
<p>where we recall that the specific angular momentum ` D r2 d�=dt is constant, and
we use Eq. (4.11) for r . The radial component of velocity is
</p>
<p>vr D

</p>
<p>a.1 � e2/ (4.17)
</p>
<p>We use the chain rule to rewrite the derivative, then evaluate dr=d� from Eq. (4.11),
and finally substitute for d�=dt using Eq. (4.16). We can convert to Cartesian
coordinates as follows:
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>vx
</p>
<p>vy
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>D

</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>vr
</p>
<p>v�
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>where we now allow a general coordinate system in which the major axis of the
ellipse lies at angle �0. Carrying out the matrix multiplication yields
</p>
<p>vx D �
`Œe sin �0 C sin.� C �0/&#141;
</p>
<p>a.1 � e2/ and vy D
`Œe cos�0 C cos.� C �0/&#141;
</p>
<p>a.1 � e2/ (4.18)
</p>
<p>To this point we have mainly characterized the orbit as a function of �, and we
have not discussed �.t/ in much detail. It turns out to be easier to keep � as
the independent variable and compute the time dependence as t.�/. Recall from
Eq. (3.10) that area in the ellipse is swept out at the rate dA=dt D `=2 where
` D

<p>p
</p>
<p>GMa.1 � e2/ is the specific angular momentum. If we rewrite this as

<p>Note that a circular orbit has e D 0 and hence t=P D �=2� , which makes sense.
Now we have the ingredients to understand the shapes of orbits and velocity
</p>
<p>curves for the two-body problem. Figure 4.3 shows examples with different
eccentricities. Recall that the orbits must share a common focus at the center of
mass, and the two objects must always lie on opposite sides of this point. If the
eccentricity is zero, the orbits are circular and concentric, and the velocity we would
measure with the Doppler effect is a sinusoidal function (because it is a projection of
circular motion). If the eccentricity is nonzero, the orbit centers are offset from one
another, and the velocity curve is less regular. These two effects give us the ability
to determine the eccentricity from the shape of the orbits or velocity curves.
</p>
<p>4.1.5 Application to the Solar System
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how the two-body theory applies to the Solar System and consider whether
it was reasonable for Kepler to neglect the Sun&rsquo;s motion. We just want to get a sense
of the numbers, so we examine the Sun&rsquo;s interaction with one planet at a time and
assume circular orbits for simplicity. For the Sun/Earth system, here are the key
quantities:
</p>
<p>a D 1AU D 1:50 � 1011m
P D 1 yr D 3:16 � 107 s
m1 D 1:99 � 1030 kg
m2 D 5:97 � 1024 kg

<p>Jupiter affects the Sun more than Earth does, because its larger mass more than
compensates for its greater distance.
</p>
<p>The Sun&rsquo;s actual motion is more complicated than we have accounted for here,
because it is influenced by all objects in the Solar System at once. Even so, the
lesson is that the Sun&rsquo;s position changes only by an amount comparable to its size,
and its speed is around a dozen meters per second. Such motion was too small for
Kepler to detect, which is why he and then Newton could treat planetary motion as
a one-body problem.
</p>
<p>4.1.6 Kepler III Revisited
</p>
<p>To conclude our discussion of the theory, let&rsquo;s see how the motion!mass principle
applies to the two-body problem. We know from Sect. 3.1 that the equation of
motion (4.10) leads to an expression for the orbital period of the form
</p>
<p>P 2 D 4�
2a3
</p>
<p>GM
</p>
<p>Each object in the two-body system has this same orbital period (they have to stay on
opposite sides of the center of mass, after all). UsingM D m1 Cm2 from Eq. (4.3)
and a D a1 C a2 from Eq. (4.12), we can now write the generalized version of
Kepler&rsquo;s third law for two-body problems:</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>P 2 D 4�
2.a1 C a2/3
</p>
<p>G.m1 Cm2/
(4.20)
</p>
<p>We can still use motion to measure mass in binary systems, but we must understand
that what Kepler&rsquo;s third law gives is total mass. In the applications below we
will consider if and when it is possible to decompose the total mass into the two
individual components.
</p>
<p>4.2 Binary Stars
</p>
<p>Binary systems provide an opportunity to measure accurate masses for stars using
two-body theory. We identify three classes of binaries based on what we are able
to observe. In a visual binary, we can watch the stars move on the sky and follow
their orbits. In a spectroscopic binary, we can detect absorption lines2 in the stars&rsquo;
spectra and use the Doppler effect to measure the velocities along the line of sight.
In an eclipsing binary, the orbit is nearly edge-on and the stars periodically pass in
front of each other. These categories are complementary; any given system may fall
into one, two, or all three of them. The way we measure motion is different in each
case, so let&rsquo;s take them one by one and see what we can learn about mass.
</p>
<p>4.2.1 Background: Inclination
</p>
<p>Before we proceed, there is one bit of technical background to discuss. We can
observe two dimensions of position projected onto the &ldquo;plane of the sky,&rdquo;3 but
the third dimension of distance is often difficult to determine. Even when it can
be found, the distance is not precise enough to reveal changes in position along the
line of sight. The quantity we can measure along the line of sight is velocity, using
the Doppler effect.
</p>
<p>This is an issue for binary stars because the orbital plane can have an arbitrary
orientation with respect to the line of sight. We define the inclination angle i to be
the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky, as shown in Fig. 4.4.
To be more precise, let On be a unit vector perpendicular to the orbital plane, which
we call the normal vector. The inclination is the angle between the normal vector
and the line of sight; this is the same as the polar angle � if we express On in spherical
</p>
<p>2In Chap. 14 we study spectral lines created by atoms and molecules in the outer layers of stars.
3Strictly speaking, we measure angles on the spherical sky. If the angular extent of a system is
small, we can project onto a plane tangent to the sphere to obtain Euclidean coordinates without
making a significant error.</p>

inclinations: i D 0ı (left), i D 30ı (middle), and i D 60ı (right)
</p>
<p>coordinates. With this definition, a face-on orbit has i D 0ı while an edge-on orbit
has i D 90ı.
</p>
<p>To specify what we can measure, let .xint; yint; zint/ be the intrinsic coordinate
system in which the orbital motion is in the .xint; yint/-plane, while .xobs; yobs; zobs/
is the observed coordinate system in which we are looking along the zobs-axis. The
two frames are rotated with respect to one another by the angle i . Let&rsquo;s choose
coordinates so the x-axes line up and the rotation applies to the y- and z-directions.
Then the observed position is related to the intrinsic position by
</p>
<p>xobs D xint and yobs D yint cos i (4.21)
</p>
<p>(Recall that the intrinsic orbital motion has zint D 0.) The measured velocity along
the line of sight is
</p>
<p>vz;obs D vy;int sin i (4.22)
</p>
<p>The factors of cos i and sin i will be important in what follows. For each type of
binary system, we need to consider whether the inclination can be determined, and
how it affects our analysis.
</p>
<p>Inclination can run between 0ı and 90ı, but the values are not all equally likely.
If orientations are random in space, the normal vector will be distributed uniformly
over the unit sphere. Figure 4.5 shows that there is more area on the sphere with a
larger value of i , and less area with a smaller value of i . In fact, the area is such that
the probability distribution for inclination is
</p>
<p>p.i/ D sin i (4.23)</p>

in the range 5ı &lt; i &lt; 10ı, while the large band has 40ı &lt; i &lt; 45ı. Larger inclinations have a
higher probability of being seen, with p.i/ D sin i
</p>
<p>This factor of sin i is the same as the factor of sin � in the spherical coordinate
volume element, dV D r2 sin � dr d� d�.
</p>
<p>4.2.2 Visual Binary
</p>
<p>If we can see both stars and watch them move, we can measure the period and
trace the orbits directly. Can we determine the inclination? This might seem tricky
at first because inclination causes an orbit to look squashed (due to the cos i
factor in Eq. 4.21): a circle can look like an ellipse, or an ellipse can look more
flattened than it truly is. There is, however, an important distinction between the
configuration of orbits in a system with inclined circular orbits and a system with
face-on elliptical orbits, as you can understand through Problem 4.1. The analysis is
a little more subtle when the orbits are both elliptical and inclined, but the key idea
is that the true orbits must satisfy Kepler&rsquo;s laws while the projected orbits may not.
This principle makes it possible to deduce the true orbits and hence determine the
inclination.
</p>
<p>The challenge with visual binaries is that we can only measure the angular size
of the orbits. If ˛1 and ˛2 are the angles subtended by the semimajor axes of the
orbits, the corresponding physical lengths are
</p>
<p>ai D D tan˛i � D˛i
</p>
<p>where D is the distance to the binary system, and we are using the small-angle
approximation tan˛i � ˛i . We can still find the mass ratio using Eq. (4.9):
m2=m1 D a1=a2 D ˛1=˛2. But if we want to find the actual masses using Eq. (4.20),
we need to know the distance:
</p>
<p>m1 Cm2 D
4�2D3.˛1 C ˛2/3
</p>
<p>GP 2
</p>
<p>Inclination is not a problem for visual binaries, but distance is.</p>

<p>4.2 Binary Stars 65
</p>
<p>4.2.3 Spectroscopic Binary
</p>
<p>If a binary system is too distant and/or small, we may not be able to resolve the two
stars on the sky. We can still analyze the motion, though, by using spectroscopy.
As the stars move in their orbits, the Doppler effect causes each star&rsquo;s spectral lines
to shift to shorter wavelengths when the star is moving toward us, and to longer
wavelengths when the star is moving away.
</p>
<p>Double-Line System
</p>
<p>If we see distinct spectral lines from both stars, we can measure both of the Doppler
velocity curves. The amplitude of the velocity curve for star #1 can be found by
using Eqs. (4.13) and (4.18) for the intrinsic velocity and including a factor of sin i
from projection (Eq. 4.22):
</p>
<p>k1 D
�
</p>
<p>m1
</p>
<p>`
</p>
<p>a.1 � e2/ sin i D
�
</p>
<p>m1
</p>
<p>2�a
</p>
<p>P.1 � e2/1=2 sin i
</p>
<p>where we simplify using Eqs. (3.11) and (4.20). The expression for k2 is similar,
with m2 replacing m1. If we measure both velocity amplitudes and take the ratio,
most of the factors drop out,
</p>
<p>k2
</p>
<p>k1
D m1
m2
</p>
<p>(4.24)
</p>
<p>and we can determine the ratio of masses directly from the measurements. Also, if
we add the velocity amplitudes we find:

</p>

</p>
<p>P.1 � e2/1=2 sin i D
2�a
</p>
<p>P.1 � e2/1=2 sin i
</p>
<p>where we use Eq. (4.4) to simplify. Thus, we can write the semimajor axis in terms
of the measurable4 quantities k1, k2, P , and e as

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>66 4 Gravitational Two-Body Problem
</p>
<p>For a spectroscopic binary, we can measure the absolute masses only if we know i .
That makes spectroscopic binaries the opposite of visual binaries in the sense that
distance is not a problem, but inclination is. If the inclination is unknown, the
observables determine only the productsm1 sin3 i andm2 sin3 i .
</p>
<p>Single-Line System
</p>
<p>If one object (say, star #2) is faint, we may not be able to detect its absorption lines
in the spectrum. We can still use the wavelength oscillations of the lines we do see
to deduce that star #1 is in a binary orbit, and to measure its velocity amplitude k1
as well as the orbital period P and eccentricity e. Now what can we do? Let&rsquo;s go
back to Eq. (4.26) and use Eq. (4.24) to eliminate k2, since it is not measurable:

<p>P
</p>
<p>2�G
</p>
<p>�1=3
</p>
<p>.1 � e2/1=2 k1 (4.27)
</p>
<p>In other words, we can use the observables to infer a funny combination of masses,
along with the usual inclination factor.
</p>
<p>What good is this? Let&rsquo;s make two assumptions. First, suppose m2 � m1 so the
left-hand side is approximately
</p>
<p>m2 sin i
</p>
<p>m
2=3
1
</p>
<p>Second, suppose we have some way to estimate m1 (perhaps from other properties
of the star, such as its brightness and color). Then we can movem1 to the right-hand
side in Eq. (4.27) and write
</p>
<p>m2 sin i D

<p>m21P
</p>
<p>2�G
</p>
<p>�1=3
</p>
<p>.1 � e2/1=2 k1 (4.28)
</p>
<p>As we will see in Sect. 4.3, these two assumptions are reasonable for extrasolar
planets, so measuring Doppler velocities of stars lets us determine m2 sin i for
planets orbiting those stars.</p>

and moving right-to-left behind the large star. In this example, the large star has a higher surface
brightness (luminosity per unit area) than the small star
</p>
<p>4.2.4 Eclipsing Binary
</p>
<p>If a binary system is very close to edge-on, one star can fully or partially eclipse
the other. The light curve, or brightness as a function of time, will dip during the
eclipse events as shown in Fig. 4.6. Eclipses can occur only if i � 90ı (or sin i � 1),
so seeing them solves the inclination problem in spectroscopic binaries and lets us
determine the absolute masses of the two stars.
</p>
<p>Eclipses contain information about the sizes of stars as well. In Sect. 4.3.2, we
will see that eclipse depth alone can reveal the relative sizes of the stars (or, in the
case below, a star and a planet). If we combine eclipses with Doppler velocities,
we can go a step further and determine the absolute sizes. For example, the time
between points A and B in Fig. 4.6 is the time it takes for the stars to move
(relative to one another) by the diameter of the small star. Since the stars are moving
in opposite directions, their relative speed is v1 C v2. The radius of the smaller star
is therefore

</p>
<p>4.3 Extrasolar Planets
</p>
<p>Since 1995, hundreds of planets have been discovered around other stars using the
techniques we just discussed. A star+planet system acts as a single-line spectro-
scopic binary, while an edge-on system acts as an eclipsing binary. The effects</p>

<p>are generally small&mdash;speeds are typically tens of meters per second or smaller,
and eclipse depths are at the percent level or smaller&mdash;but they can now be
measured routinely. Systems in which we can measure both motion and eclipses
are particularly valuable, as we will see.
</p>
<p>4.3.1 Doppler Planets
</p>
<p>A star with a planet is a prime example of a single-line spectroscopic binary; the
planet contributes very little light to the spectrum, so it does not introduce detectable
absorption lines, but its gravity causes the star to &ldquo;wobble&rdquo; so the spectral lines
oscillate in wavelength. As we saw in Eq. (4.28), if the planet is much less massive
than the star then we can estimate m2 sin i , but we need to know the mass of
the star. This can be often inferred from the star&rsquo;s visible properties; as we will
see in Chap. 16, there are good relations between the mass, luminosity, color, and
spectroscopic properties of stars.
</p>
<p>The first extrasolar planet discovered orbits the star 51 Peg [3]. Figure 4.7 shows
that the star&rsquo;s velocity curve is nearly sinusoidal, indicating that the orbit is close to
circular. The measured period, eccentricity, and velocity amplitude are [4]

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Extrasolar Planets 69
</p>
<p>The mass of the star is estimated to be m1 D 1:05Mˇ D 2:09 � 1030 kg. Using
these values in Eq. (4.28) yields for the planet:
</p>
<p>m2 sin i D

<p>.2:09 � 1030 kg/2 � .3:65 � 105 s/

<p>.1 � 0:0132/1=2 � 55:9ms�1
</p>
<p>D 8:73 � 1026 kg
D 0:46 MJ
</p>
<p>So m2 sin i is comparable to the mass of Jupiter and much smaller than the mass
of a typical star. Does that automatically imply that m2 itself is small, i.e., that the
second object is a planet? The alternative is that i is small, i.e., that the second object
is a star but the orbits are very close to face-on. The early phase of exoplanet studies
faced this key question: do low values ofm2 sin i indicate planets or just binary star
systems in nearly face-on orbits?
</p>
<p>One way to proceed is to make a statistical argument and point out that only
a small fraction of orbits are nearly face-on. If observed m2 sin i values are small
because m2 is large but i is small, then we would expect there to be many other
systems where i and hence m2 sin i are larger. How many? In order for us to
misinterpret a stellar companion with massMs as a planet less massive than Jupiter,
we would need

</p>
<p>where in the last step we make a Taylor series expansion assuming MJ � Ms .
If the true companion mass were Ms D Mˇ, then we would expect Ntot=NJ D
2:2�106, or more than a million times as many &ldquo;stellar&rdquo; companions as &ldquo;planetary&rdquo;
companions. Even if the true companion mass were as low as Ms D 0:08Mˇ
(which is the smallest mass we consider to be a star; see Chap. 16), we would still
expectNtot=NJ D 14;000. In other words, if systems like 51 Peg were really stellar
binaries seen nearly face-on, there ought to be many more systems seen at moderate
inclinations with larger values of m2 sin i . The statistics suggested otherwise,
but the argument was indirect and did not actually prove that the objects are
planets.
</p>
<p>4.3.2 Transiting Planets
</p>
<p>Strong confirmation that some companions are in fact planets came with the
discovery of planets that cross in front of their stars and produce eclipsing binaries.
As we noted in Sect. 4.2.4, seeing a transit proves that a system is very close to
edge-on, so sin i � 1 andm2 sin i accurately represents the companion&rsquo;s mass.
</p>
<p>The first transiting planet found orbits a star called HD 209458 [5,6]. The eclipse
light curve, shown in Fig. 4.8, is more complicated than the simple flat-bottomed
curve sketched in Fig. 4.6. Previously we assumed the star was a flat, uniformly-
bright disk, but in fact it is a sphere emitting light isotropically and we receive more
light from the part of the surface that faces us and less light from the limbs. This</p>

<p>where R1 and R2 are the radii of the star and planet, respectively. If we assume the
star is a uniform disk (again, not correct but reasonable for a simple estimate), then
fecl is also the fraction of the star&rsquo;s light that is blocked during the eclipse. Once
we see an eclipse, we can use the depth to measure the size of the planet in relation
to the size of the star. Then with an independent estimate of the star&rsquo;s size we can
determine the planet&rsquo;s actual size, which we can finally combine with the mass to
estimate the density. This is a big step toward understanding the physical properties
and compositions of exoplanets.</p>

</p>
<p>Application to HD 209458
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the numbers for HD 209458b5 [8]. This is a system with both Doppler
and transit information, so we can use a joint analysis to learn a lot about the planet.
The star&rsquo;s mass and radius are estimated to be

</p>

compute the mass of the companion:

from the star:

<p>5By convention, planets are named by appending letters starting with &ldquo;b&rdquo; to the name of the star.
For example, HD 209458b is a planet orbiting the star HD 209458.</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>There are many things to say:
</p>
<p>&bull; The planet is roughly the mass and size of Jupiter, but is very close to its star.
&bull; The density is much less than that of water, so the planet must be gaseous
</p>
<p>(as opposed to a rocky world like Earth).
&bull; The planet is less massive but larger than Jupiter. It appears to be &ldquo;puffed up&rdquo;
</p>
<p>compared to Jupiter, presumably by heat from its star.
</p>
<p>The discovery of large, massive planets very close to their stars&mdash;planets now called
hot Jupiters&mdash;came as an enormous surprise and posed a significant challenge to
theories of planet formation. In the traditional picture, which we will examine in
Sect. 19.4.2, planets close to a star are expected to be rocky (like the terrestrial
planetsMercury, Venus, Earth, andMars in our Solar System) because it was too hot
near the star for planetesimals to accumulate much gas or ice. Only planets forming
farther from the star were able to collect volatile elements and grow much bigger.
It seems difficult to change that picture, so the idea has emerged that hot Jupiters
formed much farther from their stars than they are now, and then migrated inwards.
Understanding how this migration occurred is a hot topic (pardon the pun) in planet
formation theory.
</p>
<p>4.3.3 Status of Exoplanet Research
</p>
<p>Studies of exoplanets are advancing at an amazing rate. As of December 2013,
more than 400 planets have been detected by the Doppler technique. With sensitive
spectrographs it is now possible to measure star velocities as small as 0:25ms�1
</p>
<p>6We follow common practice and quote planet densities in CGS rather than MKS units because
densities are of order unity in g cm�3. For example, water has a density of 1 g cm�3 at standard
temperature and pressure on Earth, while rocks and metals have densities of several g cm�3. Earth&rsquo;s
average density is about 5.5 g cm�3.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74 4 Gravitational Two-Body Problem
</p>
<p>and thus to find planets with m sin i values comparable to the mass of Earth [9].
Well-measured velocity curves can reveal complicated motion caused by multiple
planets; the most populous Doppler system found so far has at least five and perhaps
as many as seven planets [10]. At the same time, more than 250 planets have been
detected by the transit technique, along with some 2,500 more candidates from the
Kepler mission. Kepler&rsquo;s precise transit measurements make it possible to discover
planets as small as Mercury [11], systems with as many as six planets [12], and even
planets orbiting binary stars [13,14]. (Another technique for finding planets is based
on gravitational microlensing, which we will discuss in Sect. 9.2.4.)
</p>
<p>After finding planets, the next step is to characterize their physical properties.
As we saw with HD 209458b, measuring both mass and radius lets us use the mean
density to investigate the bulk composition. There seems to be a lot of diversity: for
example, the planet Kepler-10b has a mass of 4:6M˚ and a density of 8:8 g cm�3,
suggesting that it is made of rock and metals [15], while Kepler-11e has a mass of
8:0M˚ and a density of 0:58 g cm�3, suggesting that it has a significant amount of
light gas such as hydrogen and helium [12].
</p>
<p>With transiting hot Jupiters we can investigate planetary atmospheres in some
detail.7 For example, spectra taking during a transit can reveal absorption by atoms
and molecules when the star&rsquo;s light passes through the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere [16].
Infrared observations are sensitive to light emitted by hot planets. Most of time we
receive light from both the star and planet, but during the secondary eclipse (when
the planet goes behind the star; see Fig. 4.6) we receive light only from the star; we
can use the difference to determine the brightness and temperature of the planet.
We can even measure differences between daytime and nighttime temperatures and
then investigate how effectively winds and clouds distribute heat across the planet
[17, 18]. (For a more comprehensive review of work on exoplanet atmospheres,
see [19].)
</p>
<p>There is broad interest in finding planets similar to Earth. We could think about
similarity in terms of mass, size, composition, etc., but perhaps the most tantalizing
aspect is the ability to host life. On Earth it seems that liquid water is important for
life, so we typically define the &ldquo;habitable zone&rdquo; around a star to be the region in
which water could exist in liquid form (see Chap. 13, especially Problem 13.7).
Kepler has found several planets that lie in the habitable zone and are between
40 and 140% larger than Earth [20&ndash;22]. Their compositions are not known so
it remains to be seen whether these planets are like Earth, Venus, or something
altogether different. Nevertheless, it is remarkable to see how far exoplanet research
has advanced in less than two decades since 51 Peg b was discovered&mdash;and to think
that it all rests on the foundation of the gravitational two-body problem.
</p>
<p>7We defer our own study of atmospheric physics to Chaps. 12 and 13; here we briefly summarize
recent work on exoplanets.</p>

<p>4.4. In a visual binary, we need to know the period (P ), angular extent of the
semimajor axis (˛), and distance (d ) to determine the star masses (see Sect. 4.2.2).
Often the main source of uncertainty is d . If our measurement of the distance is
d ˙ �d , the fractional uncertainty is fd D �d=d .
(a) If the fractional uncertainty in the distance is fd , what is the corresponding

</p>
<p>(c) When we analyze stars orbiting the black hole at the center of the Milky Way
(Sect. 3.2.1), we are essentially studying a visual binary with one really massive
component. If our estimate of the distance to the center of the Milky Way is
8:33 ˙ 0:35 kpc [24], what is the fractional uncertainty in our estimate of the
black hole mass?

<p>4.5. The binary system J0737�3039 has two pulsars orbiting with period P D
0:102 day and eccentricity e D 0:088 [25, 26]. It is nearly edge-on, and the velocity
amplitudes are k1 D 302:9 kms�1 and k2 D 324:5 kms�1. What are the masses of
the two pulsars? What is the distance between the pulsars?
</p>
<p>4.6. Imagine that an alien astronomer observes Jupiter transiting the Sun. For this
problem, you may take Jupiter&rsquo;s orbit to be circular and assume that Jupiter crosses
the center of the star and does not emit any light itself. Define time t D 0 to be the
middle of the eclipse.
</p>
<p>(a) Plot the radial velocity curve the alien astronomer would measure, spanning at
least one period. Be quantitative; label the axes with appropriate units.
</p>
<p>(b) Plot the eclipse light curve. Make sure to identify all phases of the eclipse and
quantify when each phase starts and ends. Also specify the depth of the eclipse
(as a fraction of the uneclipsed brightness of the Sun).
</p>
<p>4.7. Show that the geometric probability for having a system oriented so that we
see a transiting planet is P � R�=a where R� is the radius of the star and a is the
orbital separation. Hint: use a geometric argument similar to the one in Sect. 4.3.1.</p>

technique.
</p>
<p>(a) Kepler is observing about 100,000 stars. If every one is just like the Sun, with
an Earth orbiting at 1 AU, how many would show transits? Use the probability

<p>(b) Imagine that Kepler discovers a system that is an exact analog to our Solar
System: &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; orbiting &ldquo;New Sol.&rdquo; How deep is the transit? How long
does each transit last? Assume the planet crosses the center of the star.
</p>
<p>(c) The reactionary group Just One Earth disputes the notion that &ldquo;New Earth&rdquo; is
a planet and argues that it is a white dwarf instead. A white dwarf is about the
same size as Earth but much more massive (MWD � 0:6Mˇ). Calculate New
Sol&rsquo;s radial velocity amplitude for the cases in which New Earth is (i) a planet,
or (ii) a white dwarf. (Keep the orbital period the same.)
</p>
<p>(d) We can now make radial velocity measurements with uncertainties of about
40 cms�1. Could we tell whether New Earth is a planet or a white dwarf?
</p>
<p>4.9. Kepler has found some planets that orbit binary star systems. The presence of
two stars complicates the motion (see Chap. 6), but not too much if the planetary
orbit is large compared with the stellar orbits. (In this problem, assume the stars and
planet all move in the same plane.)
</p>
<p>(a) Consider a coordinate system with the binary center of mass at the origin and
the two stars on the x-axis. Let the semimajor axis of the binary orbit be astar.

is the semimajor axis of the planetary orbit (in the Keplerian approximation).
Compute this ratio for the Kepler-16 system [13]. The two stars have velocity
amplitudes 13:7 and 46:5 kms�1, and their orbit has period 41:1 day and
eccentricity 0:16. The planet has a nearly circular orbit with period 228:8 day.

<p>Tidal Forces
</p>
<p>Most of our analysis so far has used point masses. Now we ask whether the sizes of
objects affect their gravitational interaction. For the source of gravity, size does not
matter if the object is spherically symmetric (see Sect. 2.3). For the target of gravity,
however, size does matter because gravity pulls harder on one side of the object than
on the other. Newton studied this problem and realized that variations in the Moon&rsquo;s
gravity across Earth&rsquo;s surface would &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; the oceans and create the tides. This
phenomenon is therefore known as the tidal force, and it has a variety of interesting
consequences.
</p>
<p>5.1 Derivation of the Tidal Force
</p>
<p>Consider the gravitational force on an object of radius R from an object of mass
M a distance r away (see Fig. 5.1). To use specific terminology, let&rsquo;s say the target
of gravity is a planet and the source of gravity is a moon (later we will reverse
the picture). Let&rsquo;s also say the moon lies in the planet&rsquo;s equatorial plane; while
this is not quite correct for the Earth/Moon system, it allows us to use familiar
geographic terms like equator, poles, and latitude. In this analysis we work in the
plane containing the moon as well as the center and poles of the planet; everything
else can be obtained by rotating around the line between the planet and moon.
</p>
<p>Since the force of gravity scales as 1=r2, the side of planet that faces the moon
feels a stronger force than the side of the planet away from the moon. The force on
the center of planet causes the planet as a whole to move (orbiting the center of mass
of the planet/moon system), so what creates the tidal force is the difference between
the force at the surface and the force at the center. This differential force pulls &ldquo;up&rdquo;
(relative to the planet&rsquo;s surface) near the equator and &ldquo;down&rdquo; near the poles.
</p>
<p>Consider a small object of mass m on the surface at latitude � . We draw the
triangle shown in Fig. 5.1, and call s the length of the third side while ˛ is the other

<p>82 5 Tidal Forces
</p>
<p>Given the sign convention that O� points &ldquo;north,&rdquo; the horizontal force&#129;Fhoriz always
points toward the equator. Here are a few additional notes:
</p>
<p>&bull; The maximum &ldquo;pull up&rdquo; (at the equator) is twice the maximum &ldquo;push down&rdquo;
(at the poles).
</p>
<p>&bull; The horizontal component of the tidal force is largest at midlatitudes.
&bull; Relative to the surface (i.e., in terms of vertical and horizontal components), the
</p>
<p>tidal force is the same on the near and far sides of the planet.

<p>5.2 Effects of Tidal Forces
</p>
<p>Since the strength scales as &#129;F / R=r3, the tidal force is important for large
objects that are near the source of gravity. There are variety of systems in which
tidal forces play an interesting role.
</p>
<p>5.2.1 Earth/Moon
</p>
<p>Like Newton, we first consider the Earth. We mentioned tidal forces from the Moon,
but in principle there could be tidal forces from the Sun as well. Which are more
important on Earth? The maximum tidal force from each is

</p>
<p>Although the Moon is much less massive than the Sun, it is so much closer that
it exerts the stronger tidal force. Nevertheless, the Sun&rsquo;s effect is not negligible.
It modulates the height of tides induced by the Moon, sometimes creating high tides
that are higher than average (known as &ldquo;spring tides&rdquo;) or low tides that are lower
than average (&ldquo;neap tides&rdquo;; see Problem 5.1).
</p>
<p>How does the tidal force from the Moon compare with Earth&rsquo;s own gravity? Let&rsquo;s
consider the maximum vertical component of the tidal force:</p>

</p>
<p>�3
</p>
<p>D 1:1 � 10�7
</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is that the maximum tidal force from the Moon
would create an acceleration of just 1:1� 10�6ms�2 in the vertical direction. Thus,
the vertical component of the tidal force would be very difficult to detect against the
backdrop of the Earth&rsquo;s gravity.
</p>
<p>The horizontal component of the tidal force is a different story, though. Earth&rsquo;s
own gravity has a tangential component only to the extent that Earth is not a
perfect sphere, which is a small effect. The horizontal tidal force therefore has little
opposition beyond the rigidity of material on Earth&rsquo;s surface. It acts on water in
the oceans (which, after all, is fluid rather than rigid) to create tidal &ldquo;bulges&rdquo; on the
near and far sides of Earth (relative to the Moon). Analyzing ocean tides in detail
requires advanced material, such as fluid dynamics on a rotating surface, but we can
still understand several notable features.
</p>
<p>As Earth rotates through the tidal bulges, we see two high tides and two low
tides each day. Shore dwellers know the cycle of tides actually lasts longer than
1 day (almost 25 h) because a point on Earth&rsquo;s surface must complete a little more
than one full rotation to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; with the Moon moving in its own orbit. Also,
friction between rock and water slows Earth&rsquo;s rotation; the length of the day is
increasing at a rate of few milliseconds per century. While this effect is small, it
can be measured using historical records of eclipse timing [1] as well as geological
records of sedimentation that is influenced by tides [2].
</p>
<p>As Earth&rsquo;s spin slows, its rotational angular momentum decreases; to keep total
angular momentum conserved, the Moon drifts farther away at a rate of about 4 cm
per year. We can measure this by timing how long it takes laser pulses to travel out
to the Moon and back to Earth, reflecting off mirrors left on the Moon by Apollo
astronauts [3]. The changes to Earth&rsquo;s rotation and the Moon&rsquo;s orbit will cease only
when Earth&rsquo;s rotation period equals the Moon&rsquo;s orbital period, i.e., when the Earth
and Moon are in synchronous rotation. At that point we would say Earth is tidally
locked with the Moon (although we are unlikely to get there because it would take
longer than the lifetime of the Sun).
</p>
<p>So far we have considered the Moon&rsquo;s effect on Earth, but we can invert the
picture and consider the tidal force on the Moon created by gravity from Earth.
How do the forces compare? As we have seen, the maximum tidal force on Earth
from the Moon is

<p>The tidal force on the Moon is strong enough to raise tidal bulges in the rock itself.
The rotational deceleration has been so strong that theMoon is already tidally locked
with Earth, which explains why we always see the same face of the Moon.
</p>
<p>5.2.2 Jupiter&rsquo;s Moon Io
</p>
<p>Another system that displays fascinating tidal phenomena is Jupiter and its moon
Io. Let&rsquo;s examine the tidal force from Jupiter on Io,
</p>
<p>&#129;Fon Io D
2GMJupmRIo
</p>
<p>r3Io
</p>
<p>and use the tidal force from Earth on our Moon (Eq. 5.4) as a reference point. Here
are the numbers we need to make the comparison:

<p>Moon 5:97� 1024 1,737 3:84 � 105
Io 1:90� 1027 1,821 4:22� 105
</p>
<p>Io and the Moon are fairly similar in terms of their size and distance from the
planet, but of course Io&rsquo;s planet is much more massive than the Moon&rsquo;s planet. That
causes the ratio of tidal forces to be

</p>
<p>Tidal effects are much stronger on Io than on the Moon. They have caused Io to be
tidally locked with Jupiter.
</p>
<p>Io&rsquo;s orbit is slightly eccentric, with e D 0:0041. This may not seem like a lot,
but it means Io&rsquo;s distance varies by 0.8% between pericenter and apocenter, which
translates into a 2.4% change in the strength of the tidal force. This may not seem
like a lot either, but 2.4% of a strong tidal force is significant. Plus, the variation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.3 Tidal Disruption 85
</p>
<p>happens over the course of Io&rsquo;s orbital period, which is just 1.8 days. In essence, Io
has been flexing every few days for more than 4 billion years, creating a significant
amount of internal heat from friction1 [4]. The cumulative heating has been strong
enough to create volcanoes that have been observed by several spacecraft visiting
Jupiter and its moons [5, 6]. The volcanoes on Io are perhaps the most striking
manifestation of the amount of energy associated with tidal forces.
</p>
<p>5.2.3 Extrasolar Planets
</p>
<p>Tidal forces can be relevant for planets as well&mdash;especially hot Jupiters, since they
are large and close to their stars. One interesting case is the planet that transits HD
209458 (see Sect. 4.3.2). Careful observations have shown that gas is escaping from
the planet [7]. Heat from the star allows some of the gas molecules to exceed the
planet&rsquo;s escape velocity (see Chap. 12 for more discussion), but the tidal force from
the star contributes by helping to counteract the planet&rsquo;s gravity.
</p>
<p>Many hot Jupiters are expected to be tidally locked to their stars. While direct
evidence is difficult to obtain, there is indirect evidence for tidal locking from studies
that examine how heat from a star is distributed across a planet by atmospheric
circulation [8,9]. It is even conceivable that a star could be tidally locked to a planet.
This may be the case for Tau Bo&ouml;tis: the rotation period of the star (measured from
flux variability) is consistent with the orbital period of its planet [10, 11].
</p>
<p>5.3 Tidal Disruption
</p>
<p>When the tidal force from a planet pulls &ldquo;up&rdquo; on a moon&rsquo;s surface, it acts against the
moon&rsquo;s self gravity. If the tidal force gets strong enough, it could actually tear the
moon apart. To estimate when this occurs, let&rsquo;s adopt a simple criterion: if the tidal
force &ldquo;up&rdquo; at the equator exceeds the gravitational force &ldquo;down,&rdquo; the surface will be
ripped off. (We remark on a more realistic criterion below.)
</p>
<p>Consider a moon with mass Mm and radius Rm, which is orbiting a planet with
massMp and radius Rp . Suppose the moon is a distance r from the planet. As we
have seen, the tidal force up at the equator of the moon is
</p>
<p>Ftidal D

<p>while the gravitational force down is

<p>Notice that the threshold depends on the density of the moon, but not its size.
The preceding analysis applies to a moon that is rigid enough to maintain
</p>
<p>its shape as it is peeled away layer by layer. Edouard Roche considered a more
general scenario in which the moon gets distorted even before it is disrupted. Tidal
distortion stretches the moon in the radial direction (relative to the planet), which
enhances the difference between the surface and center of the moon and causes
disruption to occur at a somewhat larger distance from the planet. Roche found that
a loosely bound moon would be disrupted when

<p>This condition is now called the Roche limit. The most conspicuous consequence
of tidal disruption is Saturn&rsquo;s rings. You can explore this idea and some other
interesting scenarios in the problems below.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>5.1. Spring tides occur when the Sun is oriented in a way that reinforces the Moon&rsquo;s
tidal force, while neap tides occur when the Sun partially cancels the Moon&rsquo;s effect.
Sketch the arrangements of the Earth, Moon, and Sun that lead to spring and neap
tides.
</p>
<p>5.2. Saturn has mass 5:7 � 1026 kg and radius 60;300 km.
(a) Find an image of Saturn and estimate the radius of the outer edge of the rings,
</p>
<p>in units of Saturn&rsquo;s radius.
(b) Compute Saturn&rsquo;s average mass density.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Problems 87
</p>
<p>(c) What is the minimum density that a moon of Saturn orbiting at the outer edge
of the rings must have to resist tidal disruption?
</p>
<p>(d) It is thought that Saturn&rsquo;s rings are composed of bodies made of water ice. Is this
consistent with your answer from part (c)?
</p>
<p>5.3. Neptune has mass 1:02 � 1026 kg and radius 24;764 km. Its moon Triton has
mass 2:14 � 1022 kg, radius 1;353 km, and orbital period 5:88 day. Triton&rsquo;s orbit is
&ldquo;backwards&rdquo; (retrograde) relative to Neptune&rsquo;s spin, so tidal forces are causing the
orbit to shrink. Simulations predict that Triton will cross Neptune&rsquo;s Roche limit in
a few billion years [12].
</p>
<p>(a) Where is the Roche limit for the Neptune/Triton system?
(b) Assuming Triton will reach the Roche limit in 2 billion years, approximately
</p>
<p>how fast is its orbit shrinking?
</p>
<p>5.4. You may have heard that a person falling feet-first into a black hole would be
stretched out by the tidal force, in a process affectionately called &ldquo;spaghettification.&rdquo;
But would the effect actually be dramatic? Let&rsquo;s consider:
</p>
<p>(a) Use scaling relations to determine whether the tidal force at the event horizon
gets stronger or weaker as the black hole mass increases.
</p>
<p>(b) It seems reasonable to say that we would &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the stretching only if the tidal
acceleration exceeds the familiar acceleration due to gravity on Earth. Find
the black hole mass that would produce such a tidal acceleration at the event
horizon.
</p>
<p>(c) Use your results from (a) and (b) to say whether we would be spaghettified by
the black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
</p>
<p>(d) What about by the black hole in the binary system M33-X7 (M � 16Mˇ)?
5.5. In 1994 the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter. The comet was
actually a set of fragments that hit Jupiter one after the other, producing a series
of explosions that visibly scarred the planet. Why fragments? It is believed that the
comet had been tidally disrupted during a previous close pass by Jupiter (probably
in 1992). How close must the comet have come to Jupiter?
</p>
<p>5.6. Suppose an asteroid is headed straight for Earth. People have talked about
using a rocket or bomb to divert the asteroid. You need not only to prevent a
collision, but also to avoid having the asteroid be tidally disrupted. (Creating a bunch
of asteroid rubble around Earth would be no good!) If you reach the asteroid when
it is 1 AU from Earth, how much &ldquo;sideways&rdquo; velocity would you need to impart?
How about if you reach it when it is 384,000km from Earth (the same distance as
the Moon)?
</p>
<p>You may assume the Earth and asteroid form an isolated system; in other words,
you can neglect the effects of the Moon, the Sun, and everything else in the Solar
System. You may assume the asteroid started from rest infinitely far from Earth.
</p>
<p>Hint: think about the trajectory the asteroid will follow once you have diverted
it, and about energy and angular momentum.</p>

<p>Gravitational Three-Body Problem
</p>
<p>After solving the one- and two-body problems, generalizing to the three-body
problem should be easy, right? No! In fact, it was the gravitational three-body
problem that led Henri Poincar&eacute; to discover dynamical &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; [1]. Some systems
are so sensitive to initial conditions that a tiny shift today can dramatically change
the long-term behavior. The Solar System is actually an example: despite being
well-approximated by the two-body problem, planetary motion is formally chaotic
because of gravitational interactions among planets [2]. We cannot solve the three-
body problem in general, but we can gain valuable insights from two cases that are
simplified but still relevant for systems ranging from satellites near Earth to planets
around distant stars.
</p>
<p>6.1 Two &ldquo;Stars&rdquo; and One &ldquo;Planet&rdquo;
</p>
<p>First consider a three-body problem in which two of the objects are much more
massive than the third. Let&rsquo;s use the language of a &ldquo;planet&rdquo; (massm) moving around
two &ldquo;stars&rdquo; (masses M1 and M2), although we will examine a variety of systems.
We assume m � M1;M2 so the planet does not affect the stars&rsquo; motion. Let&rsquo;s
further assume the stars have circular orbits, and the planet moves in their orbital
plane. This is clearly a restricted version of the three-body problem, but it is one
that has some interesting applications.
</p>
<p>6.1.1 Theory: Lagrange Points
</p>
<p>To analyze this problem, it is convenient to work in a reference frame that rotates
at the same angular frequency as the stars so we can keep the stars fixed and focus
on the planet. We have to be careful, though, because Newton&rsquo;s laws in their usual

<p>form hold only in an inertial (i.e., non-rotating) reference frame. In Sect. A.3 we
find that acceleration measured in a rotating reference frame (arot) is related to
acceleration measured in a fixed reference frame (afixed) via
</p>
<p>afixed D arot C&#127; � .&#127; � r/C 2&#127;� vrot C
d&#127;
</p>
<p>dt
� r
</p>
<p>where&#127; is a vector that points along the rotation axis and has an amplitude equal to
the rotational frequency ! D 2�=P . Newton&rsquo;s second law relates the true force to
the acceleration in the fixed frame: Ftrue D m afixed. We can retain the form of this
law in the rotating frame if we define an effective force such that Feff D m arot.
Clearly we need
</p>
<p>Feff D Ftrue �m&#127;� .&#127; � r/ � 2m&#127; � vrot �m
d&#127;
</p>
<p>dt
� r (6.1)
</p>
<p>The second term is known as the centrifugal force, and it is what you feel &ldquo;pulling&rdquo;
you outward on a merry-go-round. The third term is known as the Coriolis force,
and it is important for systems like airplanes and weather moving around the
rotating Earth. The fourth term is known as the Euler force, and it applies only
if the rotation rate is not uniform; it vanishes for problems like ours in which &#127; is
constant.
</p>
<p>It is important to remember that these are not real forces; they are just
consequences of working in a rotating reference frame, and are sometimes called
&ldquo;fictitious forces.&rdquo; Nevertheless, they do need to be taken into account when
working in a rotating frame.1
</p>
<p>With the planet&rsquo;s motion restricted to the orbital plane of the stars, r is
perpendicular to &#127; and the centrifugal force simplifies: &#127; � .&#127; � r/ D �!2 r.
If we neglect the Coriolis force (because it depends on the speed of the planet and
is generally small for the systems we consider), then the effective force is

<p>This function is plotted in Fig. 6.1 for an illustrative example. Since˚eff is a function
in two dimensions, it can have three types of critical points where the derivatives
vanish: local minima, local maxima, and saddle points. In the restricted three-
body problem, the effective potential has three saddle points, which all lie on the
line joining the two stars, and two local maxima, which make equilateral triangles
with the two stars (regardless of the stars&rsquo; masses; see Problem 6.3). These are
collectively known as Lagrange points after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, and they are
labeled as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; L1: between the two stars
&bull; L2: &ldquo;behind&rdquo; the less massive star
&bull; L3: &ldquo;behind&rdquo; the more massive star

<p>Formally, the saddle points L1&ndash;L3 are unstable equilibria: a particle at rest can stay
put, but any little nudge will cause it to roll away. It is possible, though, to find small
orbits around L1, L2, or L3 [3]. Despite being local maxima, L4 and L5 turn out to</p>

involves the Coriolis force, which goes beyond the level of detail we are considering
here [4].
</p>
<p>6.1.2 Applications
</p>
<p>Lagrange points are important for natural and artificial objects in our own Solar
System, and for certain types of binary star systems as well.
</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to place a satellite away from Earth but in a location where
it will not drift off. The Lagrange points for the Sun/Earth system are natural
choices. Several satellites observing the Sun, including the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory, are at L1. Several telescopes, including the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe and the Planck spacecraft (both observing the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation; see Sect. 20.1), are at L2.
</p>
<p>The L4 and L5 Lagrange points of the Sun/Jupiter system host a few thousand
asteroids collectively known as &ldquo;Trojan&rdquo; asteroids (see Fig. 6.2). These objects
are not actually fixed at L4 or L5; they move in sizable regions but are trapped in
stable orbits around the Lagrange points (again, see [4] for more about stability).
There are also some Trojan asteroids associated with Neptune, Mars, and even
Earth [5].</p>

<p>Fig. 6.3 If one component of a binary (gray) expands and fills its Roche lobe (middle), mass can
flow out and envelop the companion (right). Here the dashed line shows the effective potential
contour that passes through the Lagrange point L1
</p>
<p>The Lagrange point L1 plays a prominent role in binary systems with two stars
close together. If one star puffs up (for example, when it becomes a red giant; see
Sect. 16.3), then matter near the surface might actually feel stronger gravity from
the companion than from its own star. In that case mass can begin to flow from one
star to the other. The equipotential contour running throughL1 marks the transition
zone, which we call the Roche lobe. This scenario, which is pictured in Fig. 6.3, can
have several consequences:
</p>
<p>&bull; Accretion. To conserve angular momentum, the transferred matter often settles
into a disk around the second star and then slowly spirals in.
</p>
<p>&bull; Energy release. When matter drops from L1 onto the accretion disk or star,
potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is further converted into
heat and light; we can observe X-rays from accretion onto neutron stars and black
holes.
</p>
<p>&bull; Nova. If the second star is a white dwarf, hydrogen can accumulate and heat up
to the point that nuclear fusion occurs on the surface; this can make the system
much brighter for a few weeks or months, in a phenomenon we call a nova.
</p>
<p>&bull; Supernova. If enough mass accumulates on a white dwarf, it can carry the white
dwarf over the &ldquo;Chandrasekhar limit&rdquo; of about 1:4Mˇ (see Sect. 17.2) and
cause the white dwarf to explode as a Type Ia supernova; these objects have
become important probes of the expanding universe (see Sect. 18.2).
</p>
<p>6.2 One &ldquo;Planet&rdquo; and Two &ldquo;Moons&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Now consider a different limit in which one object far outweighs the other two
(M1 � m2; m3). This limit can describe a variety of systems, but we will initially
use the language of a &ldquo;planet&rdquo; with two &ldquo;moons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>94 6 Gravitational Three-Body Problem
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.4 The top row shows four successive points of closest approach for two bodies in a 2:1
orbital resonance. At each snapshot in time, the dots show the positions of the two bodies, and the
arrow indicates the direction of the force exerted by the outer body on the inner body. The bottom
row show a case that is not in resonance, with a frequency ratio of 2.2:1
</p>
<p>6.2.1 Theory: Resonances
</p>
<p>The planet dominates the gravitational field and keeps the moons moving in
Keplerian orbits, but whenever the moons approach one another they exchange a
small gravitational &ldquo;kick.&rdquo; In general, the kicks occur at different locations in the
orbits, so they have different directions and tend to average out over time (see the
bottom row of Fig. 6.4). Suppose, however, that the inner moon completes exactly
two orbits while the outer moon completes one:
</p>
<p>P2 D
1
</p>
<p>2
P3 , !2 D 2!3
</p>
<p>In this case the kicks happen at the same place in the orbit and in the same
direction (see the top row of Fig. 6.4) so they tend to add up over time. Any integer
combination of orbits can likewise let the gravitational kicks combine coherently.
If the inner moon goes around m times2 while the outer moon goes around n
times, then
</p>
<p>mP2 D nP3 ,
!2
</p>
<p>!3
D m
n
</p>
<p>and we call this an m:n resonance (for example, a 2:1 resonance, 3:2 resonance,
etc.). In any single orbit the gravity between the moons is weak compared with the
gravity from the planet, but the accumulated perturbations can have some interesting
consequences.
</p>
<p>2Here we briefly use m as an integer, not a mass.</p>

<p>Fig. 6.5 Orbital properties of objects in the outer Solar System. Different colors indicate different
classes of objects; we focus on the blue points, which are in orbital resonances with Neptune. The
dashed line marks the semimajor axis of Neptune; the solid curves indicate orbits whose perihelion
is interior to the semimajor axis of Neptune (upper curve) or Pluto (lower curve) (Credit: David
Jewitt, UCLA)
</p>
<p>6.2.2 Applications
</p>
<p>One effect of orbital resonances is to lock groups of objects into related orbits.
We see this in the Jupiter system; here are the orbital periods and frequencies for
three of the moons that Galileo discovered:
</p>
<p>P (day) ! (day�1)
</p>
<p>Io 1.769 3.552
Europa 3.551 1.769
Ganymede 7.155 0.878
</p>
<p>These moons are in a joint 4:2:1 resonance. The mutual gravitational interaction
causes Io&rsquo;s orbit to be more elongated than it would have been otherwise, which
couples with the tidal force from Jupiter (Sect. 5.2.2) to make Io the most geolog-
ically active body in the Solar System. We also see resonances in the outer Solar
System. Figure 6.5 shows the distribution of semimajor axes and eccentricies for</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>96 6 Gravitational Three-Body Problem
</p>
<p>known &ldquo;trans-Neptunian objects.&rdquo; There are notable groupings of objects in 1:1,
4:3, 3:2, and 2:1 resonances with Neptune. (Pluto is part of the group in the 3:2
resonance.)
</p>
<p>We might ask how objects come to be in resonance. With the trans-Neptunian
objects, an intriguing possibility is that Neptune migrated outward during the planet
formation process, causing the location of the resonance to travel outward as well.
If the moving resonance captured an object like Pluto, the gravitational interaction
would have caused Pluto to migrate such that it remained trapped in resonance [6].
In this way Neptune&rsquo;s migrationmay have swept a number of objects into resonance.
Ongoing research is examining whether a similar process happened among Jupiter&rsquo;s
moons to create the resonance between Io, Europa, and Ganymede [7].
</p>
<p>In a complementary action, resonances can also clear gaps in extended structures.
One example is the dark band called the Cassini division in Saturn&rsquo;s rings.
Objects cannot stay in this region because they would be in resonance with one
of Saturn&rsquo;s moons (see Problem 6.5); the gravitational kicks would elongate the
orbit, move the apocenter into the outer ring, and cause these objects to collide with
other ring constituents [8]. Another example involves asteroids that lie in the &ldquo;main
belt&rdquo; between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. While the distribution of positions
in space looks fairly continuous (Fig. 6.2), the distribution of semimajor axes has
conspicuous dips at certain values (notably 2.5 and 3.3AU; see Fig. 6.6).3 These
Kirkwood gaps are associated with Jupiter resonances (especially 3:1, 3:2, and
7:3). Even the outer edge of the asteroid belt seems to have been sculpted by a 2:1
resonance with Jupiter.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>6.1. A staple of science fiction is the idea that you could spin a spaceship or space
station so that the centrifugal force simulates gravity. How fast would a spaceship
with a radius of 10m have to spin to mimic the gravity on the surface of Earth? How
about a space station with a radius of 100m?
</p>
<p>6.2. There are a few known three-body solutions beyond the restricted three-body
problem and resonances. Lagrange found a solution with the three bodies forming
an equilateral triangle. For this problem, assume the masses are the same.
</p>
<p>(a) If the initial velocities are zero, what will happen to the system? Estimate how
long it takes the system to reach its final state.
</p>
<p>(b) Find the rotational velocity required to balance the gravitational attraction and
keep the masses moving along a circular obit.
</p>
<p>3You might ask why the Kirkwood gaps are not apparent in a snapshot of positions in space. Since
asteroid orbits can be moderately elliptical, an asteroid with a given semimajor axis can be found
at a range of radii. The gaps in a plot of semimajor axis get smeared out in a plot of position.</p>

distribution coincide with orbital resonances with Jupiter (dashed lines) (Credit: NASA/JPL-

</p>
<p>(c) Is the circular rotating configuration stable? Give a qualitative description of
what happens if the velocity is slightly larger or smaller than the &ldquo;critical&rdquo;
velocity from part (b), or if one of the masses moves slightly inward or outward.
</p>
<p>6.3. Consider the restricted three-body problem from Sect. 6.1. Let&rsquo;s show that
Feff D 0 at the Lagrange point L4. Recall that L4 makes an equilateral triangle
with the two masses.
</p>
<p>(a) What is the net gravitational force on a particle of mass m at L4? Work in
Cartesian coordinates, and express your answer in terms ofM1,M2, and a.
</p>
<p>(b) Convert the result from part (a) into polar coordinates centered on the M1/M2
center of mass. You should find that the force is radial.
</p>
<p>(c) Compute the centrifugal force at L4 in terms of M1, M2, and a. Hint: use
Kepler&rsquo;s laws to find !.
</p>
<p>(d) Show that the effective force vanishes at L4.
</p>
<p>6.4. Here is a way to find the locations of closest approach for two orbiting bodies.
Consider a planet going around a star in a circular orbit. Its phase angle increases
steadily with time, going from 0ı to 360ı in one period, then jumping back down to
0ı and repeating. If the orbital period is 1 yr, the plot looks like this:</p>

<p>Extended Mass Distributions: Spiral Galaxies
</p>
<p>There is much to say about galaxies,1 but with our current theme we focus on
motion and mass. The stars in a galaxy are always moving, but the sheer number of
them means the galaxy&rsquo;s overall mass distribution hardly changes with time.2 To a
good approximation we can take the mass distribution to be static, which makes
the gravitational force static and effectively puts us back in the realm of the one-
body problem. The difference now is that the mass distribution is spatially extended,
which affects the gravitational force and therefore the motion.
</p>
<p>7.1 Galaxy Properties
</p>
<p>Before we analyze the action, let&rsquo;s set the stage by reviewing the general properties
of galaxies. Observed galaxies generally fall into three categories (see Fig. 7.1 for
examples):
</p>
<p>&bull; Spiral galaxies contain stars, gas, and dust that is mostly confined to a thin,
rotating disk, although some of the mass may lie in a central bulge. Spiral arms
run through the disk, and a straight &ldquo;bar&rdquo; may or may not be present in the middle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Elliptical galaxies contain mostly stars (little gas or dust) in a smooth, feature-
less, ellipsoidal distribution of light.
</p>
<p>&bull; Irregular galaxies include everything that is not spiral or elliptical.
</p>
<p>Edwin Hubble introduced an organizational scheme known as the &ldquo;tuning fork&rdquo;
diagram, which is shown in Fig. 7.2. Elliptical galaxies are placed on the left and
classified by their degree of flattening. Spiral galaxies are divided into barred and

interactions between galaxies in Sect. 8.3.

(top) families. Lenticular galaxies lie at the transition (Figure created by Karen Masters using
astronomical images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Reproduced by permission)
</p>

disk and the degree to which spiral arms are wound tightly or loosely. (Some

</p>
<p>spiral arms.) For historical reasons, galaxies toward the left are referred to as
&ldquo;early-type&rdquo; and galaxies toward the right as &ldquo;late-type,&rdquo; but please be aware that
the names are not meant to have any temporal connotations (see [2]).
</p>
<p>7.1.1 Luminosity Profiles
</p>
<p>When quantifying galaxy properties, the most salient distinction is between disks
and spheroids. Disks are just what you think. Spheroids are roundish (spherical or
ellipsoidal) distributions of stars like those found in elliptical galaxies and the bulges
of spiral galaxies.
</p>
<p>Face-on disks seem to be quite symmetric, apart from the spiral arms. The
measured brightness profile is well described by the exponential disk model,
</p>
<p>I.R/ D I0 e�R=hR (7.1)
</p>
<p>The quantity I.R/ is called surface brightness; it has dimensions of luminosity per
unit area and is often measured in Lˇ pc�2. Also, I0 is the surface brightness at the
center of the disk, and hR is the disk scale length. If we want to speak about the
surface mass density (mass per unit area, often inMˇ pc�2), we write
</p>
<p>˙.R/ D ˙0 e�R=hR (7.2)
</p>
<p>We usually assume the light and mass distributions have the same scale length
so I.R/ and ˙.R/ are proportional to one another. However, the value of the
proportionality constant&mdash;called the mass-to-light ratio&mdash;is not well known. Even
though we understand the relation between luminosity and mass for individual
stars, at least during the main stage of their lives (see Sect. 16.2), we have limited
information about the mix of stars that make up a given galaxy.
</p>
<p>The exponential disk model has two notable limitations. First, it explicitly omits
spiral arms. While spiral structure stands out in the light distribution, it is less
dramatic in the mass distribution. We will ignore spiral arms initially but consider
them in Sect. 7.4.4. Second, the model does not account for the thickness of the disk.
In edge-on disks, the vertical extent is much smaller than the horizontal size, so we
often approximate disks as being infinitesimally thin. We study disk thickness in
Sect. 7.4.2.
</p>
<p>Spheroids have some depth along the line of sight, but all we can measure is the
projected surface brightness distribution. Spheroids typically follow what is called
the de Vaucouleurs R1=4 law after G&eacute;rard de Vaucouleurs,
</p>
<p>I.R/ D I0 e�7:67.R=Re/

</p>
<p>Fig. 7.3 Surface brightness profile of the galaxy NGC 3379. The vertical axis is �B D
�2:5 log10 ICconst where I is the surface brightness and B indicates that the measurements were
taken through a filter that transmits blue light. Because of the minus sign, brighter regions have
smaller values of �B . For the de Vaucouleurs model we expect �B D �8:3268 .R=Re/1=4Cconst,
which is shown as the dashed line (Credit: de Vaucouleurs and Capaccioli [3]. Reproduced by
permission of the AAS)
</p>
<p>This is an empirical fit to the data, and it is written with a factor of 7.67 in the
exponent so the effective radius Re also winds up being the half-light radius, or
the radius that encloses half of the light. The de Vaucouleurs profile is shown in
Fig. 7.3. As written, Eq. (7.3) describes a galaxy that looks circular, but it is can be
generalized to handle galaxies that look elliptical by replacing R with the elliptical
radius .x2 C y2=q2/1=2 where q D b=a is the axis ratio of the ellipse.
</p>
<p>7.1.2 Concepts of Motion
</p>
<p>Distinguishing between disks and spheroids also makes sense in terms of motion.
In a disk, the stars move on orbits that are nearly circular and coplanar, so the disk
rotates coherently. We can plot a rotation curve showing orbital speed as a function</p>

inclined by angle i then what we measure with the Doppler effect is vobs D vint sin i ,

disk will appear in projection as an ellipse whose axis ratio is cos i . Thus, it is
usually feasible to correct for inclination and recover the intrinsic rotation curve of
a disk galaxy.
</p>
<p>In a spheroid, the star orbits have random orientations, so stars in any small
region of the galaxy are moving every which way. Since there is no coherent
rotation to measure, we plot the distribution of velocities instead (see Fig. 7.5).
The distribution is usually close to Gaussian: if v is the Doppler speed relative to
the center of the galaxy, the number of stars as a function of v is approximately
N.v/ / exp.�v2=2�2/. The standard deviation of the distribution, � , is typically
referred to the velocity dispersion in galaxy dynamics. When analyzing spheroids,
we must keep in mind that the measured distribution includes all stars throughout
the thickness of the galaxy.</p>

</p>
<p>7.2 Equations of Motion
</p>
<p>For the rest of this chapter we focus on spiral galaxies (we study elliptical galaxies
in Chap. 8). The disk defines a preferred plane, and the main component of motion is
tangential in that plane, but there are small components of radial motion within the
disk and vertical motion perpendicular to the disk. A flat disk has axial symmetry,
but we begin with the case of spherical symmetry to connect with our previouswork.
As we will see, there is good evidence that galaxies are embedded in &ldquo;dark matter
halos&rdquo; that are fairly round, so spherical models do have some relevance for spiral
galaxies.
</p>
<p>7.2.1 Spherical Symmetry
</p>
<p>In Sect. 3.1 we studied the equation of motion for a point mass. We now consider a
case that retains spherical symmetry but allows an arbitrary radial dependence, so
the gravitational potential ˚ depends on r but not on � or �. The analysis follows

<p>Suppose the mass distribution and gravitational potential are symmetric about the

<p>7.3 Rotational Dynamics
</p>
<p>Since the main component of spiral motion is ordered rotation, let&rsquo;s begin our
analysis there. Suppose for the time being that all stars move on perfect circular
orbits. How does the mass determine the motion, and what can we learn by
observing that motion?</p>
<p/>

<p>106 7 Extended Mass Distributions: Spiral Galaxies
</p>
<p>7.3.1 Predictions
</p>
<p>If the mass distribution is spherically symmetric, we can analyze the motion using
Eq. (7.5). For pure circular motion, the radius is constant so d2r=dt2 D 0 and we
can solve the equation to find the angular speed

<p>D
�
</p>
<p>GM.r/
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>(7.7)
</p>
<p>where we write v.r/ to emphasize that speed may vary with radius. (This result can
also be derived by setting the centripetal acceleration for a circular orbit, a D v2=r ,
equal to the acceleration due to gravity, a D GM.r/=r2.) Equation (7.7) is useful
if we know the mass distribution and want to compute the corresponding rotation
curve. If instead we measure the rotation curve, we can invert the relation to find the
mass:
</p>
<p>M.r/ D r v.r/
2
</p>
<p>G
(7.8)
</p>
<p>This is the motion/mass principle applied to rotating spherical objects. Note that
outside an object with a finite extent,M.r/ becomes constant and Eq. (7.7) recovers
the Keplerian rotation curve v / r�1=2.
</p>
<p>The analysis of a disk is more involved. In the idealized case of an infinitesimally
thin disk, the density is zero everywhere except in the z D 0 plane. The approach
is to solve the Laplace equation r2˚ D 0 for z &curren; 0 and then apply appropriate
boundary conditions at z D 0. See Sect. 2.6 of Galactic Dynamics by Binney and
Tremaine [4] for the complete analysis. We are most interested in motion within the
disk, so we quote the general expression for the gravitational potential in the z D 0
plane,

<p>This rotation curve is plotted in Fig. 7.6. The important qualitative features are that
the curve peaks at
</p>
<p>rmax D 2:15 hR and vmax D 1:56.G˙0hR/1=2
</p>
<p>and then declines with radius. Since the disk mass is finite, the rotation curve
approaches the Keplerian form at large radius.
</p>
<p>7.3.2 Observations and Interpretation
</p>
<p>Real rotation curves may be more complicated than Fig. 7.6 because disks need not
be perfectly exponential, and stellar bulge or gaseous components can also affect the
motion. Even so, as a general rule rotation curves should decrease in the outer part
of disks if spiral galaxies contain only the stars and gas we see. It therefore came as
a surprise in the 1970s when Vera Rubin and others began to discover that observed
rotation curves do not match predictions. Today we see that some rotation curve fall
but not as much as expected, others rise all the way to the largest radii at which they
are measured, and many remain approximately constant over a wide range of radii
(see Fig. 7.7). The shapes have been seen so many times that the term flat rotation
curves has entered the lexicon of astronomy.
</p>
<p>What is going on? If the observed rotation speed is higher than expected, then
the gravitational force must be stronger than expected, so there must be more mass</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>than expected. Whatever this mass is, we seem not to detect any light from it. That,
in a nutshell, is the original argument for dark matter.4
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look for the simplest scenario that could give rise to rotation curves similar
to what is observed. As a toy model, let&rsquo;s suppose the rotation curve is perfectly flat
at all radii: v.r/ D vc where vc is the constant circular velocity. Let&rsquo;s also suppose
the mass distribution is spherical. This is obviously wrong&mdash;the stellar distribution
is manifestly not spherical&mdash;so why should we make the assumption?
</p>
<p>&bull; It is simple, and simple can often be good for capturing key ideas without getting
bogged down in details.
</p>
<p>&bull; We do see some stars (individually and in globular clusters) in a round stellar
&ldquo;halo&rdquo; around the disk.
</p>
<p>&bull; We also see satellite galaxies whose motions imply a roundish halo.
&bull; Gravitational lensing provides evidence for roundish halos (see Chap. 9).
&bull; Galaxy formation models suggest that disks should be embedded in dark matter
</p>
<p>halos that are fairly round.
</p>
<p>With the spherical assumption, Eq. (7.8) gives the enclosed mass as
</p>
<p>M.r/ D r v

</p>
<p>G
</p>

</p>
<p>4Evidence for &ldquo;missing mass&rdquo; appeared as early as the 1930s, from an analysis of motions in
the Coma cluster of galaxies by Fritz Zwicky [6] and an analysis of vertical motions of stars in
the Milky Way by Jan Oort [7]. Those analyses were hindered, especially by poor knowledge of
mass-to-light ratios, but notice that they too were based on the motion!mass principle.</p>

<p>7.3 Rotational Dynamics 109
</p>
<p>This model is known as an isothermal sphere because any gas in the system will
reach an equilibrium with the same (&ldquo;iso&rdquo;) temperature (&ldquo;therm&rdquo;) everywhere.5
</p>
<p>While this is admittedly a toy model, it is a very useful one that we will see several
times in the next few chapters. The simplicity does raise a few concerns:
</p>
<p>&bull; In the model, � diverges as r ! 0; this is not devastating, but it is inconvenient.
&bull; In the model, v remains constant all the way down to the origin, whereas in real
</p>
<p>galaxies the rotation speed tends to be small near the center.
&bull; In the inner parts of real galaxies, there is probably more stellar matter than dark
</p>
<p>matter (more on this in a moment).
</p>
<p>One way to address these concerns is to modify the density profile slightly and write
</p>
<p>�.r/ D v

</p>
<p>where a is referred to as the core radius, because when r � a the model has a
central &ldquo;core&rdquo; where the density is approximately constant. When r � a the model
reduces to � / r�2. This model is referred to as a softened isothermal sphere,
although the word &ldquo;softened&rdquo; is sometimes dropped. Let&rsquo;s derive the rotation curve
for a softened isothermal sphere. First, the enclosed mass is

<p>r � a tan�1 r

</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>where we change variables using x D r 0=a to make the integral dimensionless.
The rotation speed is then

<p>(7.11)
</p>
<p>It is useful to understand the limiting behavior. If r � a then a=r approaches
zero while tan�1.r=a/ approaches �=2, so the second term in parentheses vanishes.
This means v.r/ approaches a constant at large radii, so the rotation curve
is asymptotically flat. At small radii r � a, we can use a Taylor series expansion:

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>110 7 Extended Mass Distributions: Spiral Galaxies
</p>
<p>We have been focusing on the physical speed of the stars, but let&rsquo;s briefly consider
the angular speed ! D v=r . At small radii, where the rotation curve rises linearly,

</p>
<p>In other words, stars at different radii all take the same amount of time to go around.
This is known as solid body rotation because it describes the rotation of an object
(such as a compact disk) in which all the atoms are connected to one another.
By contrast, in the flat part of the rotation curve,
</p>
<p>v.r/ D vc ) !.r/ D

</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>which is not constant. This corresponds to differential rotation, and it is generic for
spiral galaxies in the sense that it occurs even if the rotation curve is not perfectly
flat. Differential rotation will be crucial when we study spiral structure in Sect. 7.4.4.
</p>
<p>7.3.3 Cold Dark Matter
</p>
<p>While the spherical model was instructive, it omitted known parts of the galaxy: the
stellar disk and bulge, and perhaps gas as well. If we want to study dark matter in
any detail, we need to build models that account for all the components of a galaxy,
and in order to do that we need to consider how multiple components combine.
By the principle of superposition, densities and masses just add:
</p>
<p>Mtot D Mdisk CMbulge CMgas CMhalo
</p>
<p>We have seen that expressions for mass involve v2, so the sum of masses translates
into
</p>
<p>v2tot D v2disk C v2bulge C v2gas C v2halo (7.12)
</p>
<p>To quantify the disk, bulge, and gas components, we can take the observed
distributions and apply a mass-to-light ratio to obtain model mass distributions.
If the mass-to-light ratio is not well known (see Sect. 7.1.1), it can be treated as
a free parameter when fitting models to data.
</p>
<p>To quantify the dark matter component, people have taken two basic approaches.
One is to look for the simplest model that can reproduce the data. The softened
isothermal sphere fits the bill. By increasing the core radius, we can reduce the
density of dark matter at small radii and let stars dominate the mass there. Then we
can adjust the vc parameter for the halo component to keep the circular velocity high
at large radii (where the contributions from stars and gas are falling off). Whether
or not this model has a deep physical motivation, it seems to be successful in fitting
the data. This is the type of model shown in the left panel of Fig. 7.8.</p>

model, which is similar to the isothermal model discussed in the text. In the right panel, the halo
is treated with an NFW model. The small bottom panels show the residuals, or the differences
between data and model. Note that 1 kpc corresponds to 5:800 (Credit: Gentile et al. [8], reproduced
by permission of Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society)
</p>
<p>The second approach is to try to predict the properties of dark matter halos
and compare those predictions with observations. What do we know about dark
matter?
</p>
<p>&bull; It must be non-relativistic; otherwise it would move too fast to collect around
galaxies.
</p>
<p>&bull; As a starting point, we assume that dark matter feels gravity but is not affected
by any other forces.
</p>
<p>&bull; From studies of &ldquo;nucleosynthesis&rdquo; in the early universe (see Sect. 20.2), we
know that most of the dark matter cannot be composed of protons, neutrons,
and electrons. It must be something exotic&mdash;probably some other kind of
fundamental particle.
</p>
<p>These are the tenets of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM)6 paradigm, which has
become the foundation for modern cosmology. In Chap. 11 we will see that this
model is remarkably successful at describing the global structure of the universe.7
</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, people have used computer simulations to study how galaxies
form in a universe dominated by cold dark matter. They find that simulated dark
matter halos can be described by a density profile of the form

</p>
<p>6&ldquo;Cold&rdquo; refers to the fact that the particles are slow compared with the speed of light. As we will
see in Chap. 12, the temperature of a gas is related to the typical speed of its constituent particles.

<p>where rs is a &ldquo;scale radius&rdquo; and A is a constant that has dimensions of mass

the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile after the scientists who first made the
prediction [9, 10]. An important feature of the NFW profile is that the density
diverges as � / r�1 at small radius. This is referred to as a cusp, in contrast with
the core in the softened isothermal model.
</p>
<p>To test the prediction, we need to compute the NFW rotation curve. First, the
enclosed mass is

<p>This rotation curve is shown in Fig. 7.9. The presence of the central cusp causes the
rotation curve to increase more quickly at small radius (v / r1=2 when r � rs)
than it does for the isothermal model with a flat core. The dependence � / r�3 for
r � rs is steeper than the isothermal model, so the rotation curve declines slowly
at large radius.
</p>
<p>You might think this would lead to a nice application of the scientific method:
we have both a prediction and data to test it. The situation is murky, though.</p>

<p>7.3 Rotational Dynamics 113
</p>
<p>For ESO 287-G13 (Fig. 7.8), an isothermal model is formally better than an NFW
model, although the main differences are at small radii where the motion may
be complicated. For other galaxies, NFW fits seem to be favored. The challenge
here is dealing with devils that lurk in the details for both observations and
interpretation.With the measurements, we must worry about systematic effects such
as the placement of the slit used to measure the spectrum, and blurring from the
atmosphere. With the analysis, we usually assume the dark matter halo is spherical,
the disk is thin, and the orbits are perfectly circular; while those assumptions may
seem reasonable, they might not be strictly true, and relaxing them could affect
the conclusions. The last point to recall is that there are uncertainties in the rotation
curve data themselves, the inclination, and the mass-to-light ratio. All together, these
effects can permit a range of successful models, and it is difficult to say for certain
whether rotation curves &ldquo;prefer&rdquo; cusps or cores.
</p>
<p>To bypass some of the details, we could just ask howmuch darkmatter is found in
the central regions of galaxies. There seems to be less dark matter than CDMmodels
would predict. However, it is not clear if that represents a fundamental problem with
the CDM paradigm. It may just indicate that there are aspects of galaxy formation&mdash;
which is complicated, after all&mdash;that are not fully understood. For our purposes,
what is important is to follow the physical reasoning that astronomers use to find
evidence for dark matter in galaxies and deduce its abundance and distribution.
</p>
<p>7.3.4 Is Dark Matter Real?
</p>
<p>Throughout the preceding analysis we relied on Newton&rsquo;s laws of gravity and
motion to connect rotation curves with the underlying mass distribution. When
we saw a discrepancy, we imagined that we have the right laws of physics but the
wrong ideas about howmass is distributed. That approach seems reasonable because
Newton&rsquo;s laws (and Einstein&rsquo;s generalizations of them; see Chap. 10) have been well
tested. However, most of the tests have taken place on Earth and in the Solar System,
where the accelerations are much larger than the accelerations of stars in galaxies:
</p>
<p>Situation Acceleration (m s�2)
</p>
<p>Surface of Earth 9:8
Moon orbiting Earth 0:003
Earth orbiting Sun 0:006
Sun orbiting Galaxy 2� 10�10
</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Mordehai Milgrom asked: What if Newton&rsquo;s laws break down at low
accelerations? After all, we already know they fail at high speeds (for relativity) or
short distances (for quantum mechanics). Milgrom proposed to modify Newton&rsquo;s
second law when the acceleration is smaller than some value a0:</p>

<p>m

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>This idea is known as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) because what
changes is not the force of gravity but rather a particle&rsquo;s response to the force. In a
series of papers, Milgrom argued that applying MOND below a0 � 10�10ms�2
could explain galaxy rotation curves as well as an observed correlation between the
rotation speeds and luminosities of spiral galaxies [11&ndash;13]. You can explore these
ideas in Problem 7.5.
</p>
<p>Another possibility is to modify Newton&rsquo;s law of gravity so the force is
something other than F D GMm=r2. We know the usual force law works very
well on scales ranging from labs on Earth to the Solar System, so the idea would be
to have a force law that is equivalent to F D GMm=r2 at &ldquo;small&rdquo; radii but has a
different form at radii larger than some value r0.
</p>
<p>Most astronomers prefer the idea of dark matter to that of modified dynamics
or gravity. While MOND can successfully explain galaxy dynamics, it faces more
trouble with galaxy clusters (most famously, the Bullet Cluster; see Sect. 9.4) and
the universe as a whole. Even MOND requires some amount of dark matter to
explain these systems. Supporters of MOND suggest the additional mass could be
provided by massive neutrinos, but it remains to be seen whether this hypothesis
works out in detail (e.g., [14&ndash;16]). In my view, strong evidence supports the
conventional theory of dark matter. Still, there is value in exploring alternatives
because scientific disputes like dark matter versus MOND are ultimately settled by
developing different models and testing them with observations.
</p>
<p>7.4 Beyond Rotation
</p>
<p>To this point we have focused on tangential motion, which is the predominant form
of motion in spiral galaxy disks. Stars can, however, have small components of
motion in the radial and vertical directions. We can analyze the additional motion
using Eq. (7.6).

</p>
<p>This conservation law follows from axisymmetry (similar to the way in which
conservation of the full angular momentum vector follows from spherical symmetry
in Sect. 2.2).
</p>
<p>7.4.2 Vertical Motion
</p>
<p>The vertical component of the equation of motion is
</p>
<p>d2z
</p>
<p>dt2
D �@˚
</p>
<p>@z
(7.17)
</p>
<p>We cannot solve this equation in general without knowing the gravitational potential
˚.R; z/. However, we can learn a lot if we consider small motions. Since disks are
thin, the stars never get very far from the midplane, so we might consider z to be
small and make a Taylor series expansion of the potential:

</p>
<p>z2 C : : : (7.18)
</p>
<p>If we take the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; of the disk (indicated by the subscript 0) to be the place
where @˚=@z D 0, the second term vanishes and Eqs. (7.17) and (7.18) combine
to give

<p>This is an equation for simple harmonic motion (The angular frequency � may
depend on R but it is independent of z.) Physically, any star above the disk will
be pulled down. The star will pass through the disk, come out the other side, and
then be pulled back up. The star will keep going back and forth, oscillating in the
vertical direction with a period of P D 2�=�.
</p>
<p>Our Sun is presently about 25 pc out of the midplane of the Milky Way and
moving away at a speed of about 7 kms�1 [17, 18].</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>116 7 Extended Mass Distributions: Spiral Galaxies
</p>
<p>Example: Uniform Disk
</p>
<p>Consider a simple model in which the disk density is uniform. (This can be viewed
as an approximation that is valid in a small region of a more realistic disk model.)
Let&rsquo;s explicitly derive the equation of motion and check that the preceding analysis
makes sense. We start with the following formal analysis:
</p>
<p>a D �r˚
r � a D �r2˚ D �4�G�
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>.r � a/ dV D �4�G
Z
</p>
<p>� dV
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>a � dA D �4�GMin (7.20)
</p>
<p>In the second line, we use the Poisson equation, r2˚ D 4�G�. From the third
to the fourth line, we use Gauss&rsquo;s divergence theorem to rewrite the volume
integral on the left as a surface integral. (You may have seen a similar analysis
in electromagnetism.) The fourth line tells us the surface integral of the acceleration
vector is given by the mass enclosed by that surface.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the surface of integration to be a small box that extends from �z toCz
and has cross sectional area S (the shape of S is arbitrary). For vertical acceleration,
the integral on the left-hand side of Eq. (7.20) has aS for the top and another aS
for the bottom, giving a total of 2aS . The mass inside the box is the density, �, times
the volume, 2zS . Putting the pieces together, we have
</p>
<p>2aS D �4�G � 2zS� ) a D �4�G�z
</p>
<p>This is the vertical acceleration at height z in a uniform density disk. Since the
vertical acceleration is a D d2z=dt2, the key equation is
</p>
<p>d2z
</p>
<p>dt2
D �4�G�z
</p>
<p>This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, as expected. The vertical
oscillation frequency is � D .4�G�/1=2.
</p>
<p>Application: Disk Thickness
</p>
<p>Real spiral galaxy disks have finite thicknesses. Empirically, the vertical distribution
is often characterized as an exponential function,
</p>
<p>�.z/ / e�jzj=hz</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.4 Beyond Rotation 117
</p>
<p>where hz is the scale height. At any given time, some stars are moving up and others
down, so there is a distribution of vertical velocities and it is natural to characterize
the distribution using the vertical velocity dispersion �z. When quantified in this
way, the MilkyWay seems to have two disk components (see [17,19] and references
therein). The &ldquo;thin&rdquo; disk has hz � 300 pc and �z � 18 kms�1, and it tends to contain
younger stars. The &ldquo;thick&rdquo; disk has hz � 900 pc and �z � 35 kms�1, and it tends to
contain older stars. The disk scale radius is hR � 3:5 kpc so even the &ldquo;thick&rdquo; disk
is still thin in comparison with its radial extent. Other spiral galaxies show similar
structures [20].
</p>
<p>Disk thickness can be created by a variety of mechanisms. When a star encoun-
ters an object such as another star, a gas cloud, or a spiral arm, the gravitational
interaction can give the star a &ldquo;kick&rdquo; in the vertical direction. Also, if a star migrates
out from the center of the galaxy, any vertical motion can be amplified. Finally,
an external event such as a small galaxy falling into the Milky Way can generate
vertical motion. There is a lot of interest in using the vertical structure of galaxy
disks to understand the processes that have driven their evolution over billions of
years (see [21] and references therein).
</p>
<p>7.4.3 Radial Motion
</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the radial component of the equation of motion (7.6a). Using
Eq. (7.16) to rewrite d�=dt in terms of the constant `z, we obtain
</p>
<p>d2R
</p>
<p>dt2
D �@˚

<p>@R

`2z

</p>
<p>˚eff.R/ � ˚.R/C
`2z
</p>
<p>2R2
(7.22)
</p>
<p>As with vertical motion, we cannot solve the equation of motion in general without
knowing the potential, but we can make progress by considering small deviations
from a constant radius. A circular orbit has d2R=dt2 D 0, so by Eq. (7.21) the
derivative @˚eff=@R must be zero at the radius of the circular orbit. Let&rsquo;s call this
radiusR0, and then write the radius more generally as
</p>
<p>R D R0 C&#129;R
</p>
<p>where we expect&#129;R to be small. Then we can make a Taylor series expansion:
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>118 7 Extended Mass Distributions: Spiral Galaxies
</p>
<p>The first term disappears when we take the derivative. The second term vanishes
because we just noted that @˚eff=@R D 0 at R0. Thus the only meaningful term is
the third, and using it in Eq. (7.21) yields
</p>

<p>Stars can oscillate in and out (in addition to up and down), all while orbiting the
center of the galaxy. The radial oscillations can actually be viewed as a small circle
superimposed on the main circular orbit&mdash;in other words, as an epicycle. The idea
originally introduced by ancient Greeks to explain the retrograde motion of planets
(see Sect. 2.1) has reemerged, albeit in a different form! Because of this connection,
� is called the epicycle frequency.
</p>
<p>Example: Point Mass
</p>
<p>Consider motion around a point mass. Obviously this is not a good model for a
galaxy, but it serves as an instructive example. A point mass has spherical symmetry,
but we can think of that as a type of axial symmetry as well. The gravitational
potential is

</p>
<p>where ! D v�=r is the angular frequency. In other words, around a point mass
the epicycle frequency exactly equals the angular frequency. That, in turn, allows
the orbit to be perfectly closed (the object returns exactly to its starting point). We
already knew this from our analysis of Kepler&rsquo;s laws and the one-body problem, but
now we see it in a different context.
</p>
<p>7.4.4 Application to Spiral Arms
</p>
<p>We finally have the tools to examine the defining feature of spiral galaxies, namely
spiral arms.We noted in Sect. 7.3.2 that spiral galaxy disks have differential rotation,
meaning the orbital period varies with radius. As a result, if we paint a stripe on a
galaxy, it will wrap up and look like a spiral, as shown in Fig. 7.10. This is good,
right? Well, yes and no.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;yes&rdquo; applies to certain kinds of spiral galaxies called flocculent spirals,
like NGC 4414 shown in Fig. 7.11. Flocculent means fluffy; this term is applied to
galaxies with little wisps of spiral structure, rather than grand spiral arms. Here the</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 7.11 Hubble Space Telescope image of the flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 4414 (Credit: NASA
and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA))
</p>
<p>idea is that if you have a little cloud of gas that forms some stars, differential rotation
can stretch the cloud out into a wispy structure like what is seen in these galaxies.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;no&rdquo; applies to grand design spirals, or galaxies where the spiral arms
run through the whole disk, like the one shown in Fig. 7.1. The problem is that
differential rotation causes spirals to wind up way too fast to survive for billions of
years. This is known as the winding problem, and it means the simplest imaginable
explanation of spiral arms cannot be correct.
</p>
<p>How can we proceed? Imagine creating an arrangement of stars labeled by
j D 1; : : : ; N . From Sect. 7.4.3 we know each star will execute radial oscillations
given by
</p>
<p>Rj .t/ D aC b cos.�t C ˛j /
</p>
<p>where a is the radius of the reference circle, b is the amplitude of the radial
oscillations, � is the epicycle frequency, and ˛j is the initial phase of the oscillations.
While the star is doing this, it is also moving around the galaxy with angle
</p>
<p>�j .t/ D �j 0 C !t
</p>
<p>where ! is the angular speed and �j 0 is the starting angle for star j . The star&rsquo;s x
and y positions as a function of time are then

</p>
<p>What happens at later times? Each star follows its epicyclic orbit, oscillating in
radius as it orbits the galaxy. But the pattern appears to rotate more slowly, as shown
in the remaining panels of Fig. 7.12. It is crucial to understand that the motion of the
pattern is different from the motion of the individual stars.</p>

�j .t/ D �j 0 C !t (7.26b)

</p>
<p>�t C 2�j 0 D 0 ) �j 0 D �
�t
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>Plugging this into Eq. (7.26b), we find that the angular position of this farthest star is

<p>�j .t/ D
�
</p>
<p>! � �
2
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>t

given by the pattern speed
</p>
<p>˝p D ! �
�
</p>
<p>2
(7.27)
</p>
<p>The example in Fig. 7.12 has ! D 6:28 and � D 10:05, yielding ˝p D 1:26. The
time it takes for the pattern to rotate once is P D 2�=˝p D 5:0. Thus, the pattern
of stars rotates five times more slowly than any individual star. The color coding in
the figure is designed to show this. Notice, for example, that at t D 0:5 each star has
moved halfway around the galaxy, but the oval pattern has rotated by only 36ı.
</p>
<p>How does this help with spiral structure? At t D 0 we can set up nested ovals to
create a spiral pattern, as shown in Fig. 7.13. When we let this evolve, as shown in
Fig. 7.14, the spiral winds up much less quickly than before. Working with patterns
that can occur thanks to epicyclic orbits, we can mitigate the winding problem.
</p>
<p>There is still more that can be said about the dynamics of spirals. To this point we
have imagined that the stars move in a smooth, constant gravitational field, but in</p>

<p>Fig. 7.14 If stars move on epicyclic orbits, they can form spiral patterns that rotate more slowly
than the stars themselves, which helps mitigate the winding problem
</p>
<p>fact they feel an additional force from the local overdensity of matter in a spiral arm.
Lin and Shu [23,24] developed this notion into a hypothesis that spiral arms are self-
sustaining density waves propagating through galaxy disks. The physical picture is
often likened to a traffic jam, with stars as cars that catch the jam from behind, slow
down as they move through it, and then escape out the front and keep going. The
Lin-Shu hypothesis has stimulated extensive work on the theory of density waves in
disks (see [24]), but whether it truly describes real spirals is still unclear. In general,
the hypothesis can explain why there is more star formation in spiral arms than
elsewhere in the disk: the buildup and compression of gas in the arms can kick-start
the formation process (see Chap. 19). In detail, though, the predictions may not be
consistent with new observations of the spatial distribution of features associated
with star formation [25]. Regardless of how the story turns out, the key point for us
is that spiral arms are patterns (rather than fixed groups of stars) whose behavior
seem to be connected to the epicyclic motion we have studied here.</p>

<p>Problems
</p>
<p>7.1. Consider the exponential disk model in Eq. (7.1).
</p>
<p>(a) Show that the total brightness of the exponential disk is Itotal D 2�I0h2R. Hint:
change variables to x D R=hR, and use integration by parts.
</p>
<p>(b) What fraction of the total light is contained within one disk scale length (R �
hR)? Within three disk scale lengths (R � 3hR)?
</p>
<p>7.2. The Milky Way has a rotation curve that is approximately flat with a circular
speed of about 220 kms�1. The Sun is about 8 kpc from the center of our Galaxy.
In this problem you may assume the mass distribution of the Milky Way is
spherical.
</p>
<p>(a) How much mass is enclosed by the orbit of the Sun (inMˇ)?
(b) Assuming an appropriate mass distribution, what is the density of mass in the
</p>
<p>vicinity of the Sun (inMˇ pc�3)?
(c) How long does it take the Sun to make one orbit of our Galaxy?
</p>
<p>7.3. Recall the rotation curve data and models for the galaxy ESO 287-G13 shown
in Fig. 7.8. Answer the following questions for both types of models.
</p>
<p>(a) What is the mass of dark matter within 5000?
(b) What fraction of the total mass within 5000 is dark matter? (Here you may
</p>
<p>assume all the mass is in a spherical distribution.)
</p>
<p>7.4. Here is the rotation curve for the galaxy UGC 5166, along with a model that
includes a spheroidal bulge component (data from [26], figure courtesy Kristine
Spekkens).

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Problems 125
</p>
<p>(b) A popular model for the mass distribution in a spheroid is the Hernquist model,
</p>
<p>�.r/ D Mtotal a

</p>
<p>where Mtotal is the total mass and a is a constant with dimensions of length.
Derive the rotation curve for this model.
</p>
<p>(c) Fit the Hernquist model to the bulge component in UGC 5166 and plot your
derived rotation curve (with r in kpc and v in km s�1). Hint: use the total bulge
mass from part (a), and use trial and error to find a reasonable value for a.
</p>
<p>7.5. In Modified Newtonian Dynamics, Newton&rsquo;s second law is replaced by
F D ma2=a0 for accelerations smaller than some value a0 (see Eq. 7.15).
(a) In this scheme, what is the rotation curve around a point mass?
(b) Assuming that all spiral galaxies have the same ratio of mass to light, what is
</p>
<p>the scaling relation between circular velocity and luminosity in MOND?
</p>
<p>7.6. The vertical motion of stars in a spiral galaxy depends on the gravity exerted
by the disk, so it allows us to &ldquo;weigh&rdquo; the disk.
</p>
<p>(a) Use dimensional analysis to derive an estimate of the mass density � of a spiral
galaxy disk, in terms of its scale height hz, its vertical velocity dispersion �z,
and a relevant physical constant.
</p>
<p>(b) Use the disk parameters given in Sect. 7.4.2 to estimate the mass density of the
Milky Way&rsquo;s disk, in Mˇ pc�3. Do the thin and thick disks give a consistent
results to the level of precision we might expect from dimensional analysis?
</p>
<p>7.7. Recall from Sect. 7.4.2 that the vertical of motion for a uniform density disk
corresponds to simple harmonic motion with angular frequency � D .4�G�/1=2.
The motion can therefore be written as
</p>
<p>z.t/ D A sin.�t/C B cos.�t/
where A and B are constants.8
</p>
<p>(a) The mass density near the Sun is about � D 0:1Mˇ pc�3 [28]. The Sun is about
25 pc above the midplane of the disk and rising at 7 kms�1. Find the constants
A andB , then plot the Sun&rsquo;s vertical motion. Label the axes and be quantitative.
</p>
<p>(b) Some people have suggested that the Sun&rsquo;s motion through spiral arms and/or
the Galactic disk may affect climate and evenmass extinctions on Earth [29,30].
(Passing through higher-density regions increases the chance of encounterswith
other stars or gas clouds that could send comets toward the inner Solar System.)
When did the Sun last cross the midplane of the disk?
</p>
<p>7.8. How does the epicycle frequency compare with the angular frequency for an
isothermal sphere? The gravitational potential is ˚.r/ D v2c ln.r/C constant. Using
the isothermal model for the Milky Way, what is the epicycle period for the Sun?
</p>
<p>8This question is inspired in part by a problem in the book by Carroll and Ostlie [27].</p>

<p>Chapter 8
</p>
<p>N-Body Problem: Elliptical Galaxies
</p>
<p>In Chap. 7 we treated galaxies as if each star orbits in a fixed gravitational field.
In fact, the gravity comes from other stars and particles of dark matter, which
themselves are moving. How can we analyze a collection of particles that move
under the influence of each other&rsquo;s gravity? While we can write down the exact
equations of motion, we should not expect to solve them by hand. Where we can
make progress is understanding statistical properties of the motion. The statistical
approach is applicable to elliptical galaxies and a range of other systems.
</p>
<p>8.1 Gravitational N-Body Problem
</p>
<p>We begin by developing a formal framework for analyzing the collective motion of
N particles interacting via gravity.
</p>
<p>8.1.1 Equations of Motion
</p>
<p>The force on any one object in the system is a vector sum of contributions from all
the other objects. When we write the force vectors, it is useful to avoid unit vectors
by writing Or D r=jrj. In the one-body problem, the force can then be written as
</p>
<p>F D �GMmjr j2 Or D �
GMm
</p>
<p>jr j3 r
</p>
<p>In the N -body problem, the force on star ˛ from star ˇ is
</p>
<p>f˛ˇ D �
Gm˛mˇ
</p>
<p>jr˛ � rˇj3
.r˛ � rˇ/

<p>128 8 N-Body Problem: Elliptical Galaxies
</p>
<p>Notice that if we reverse the indices we have
</p>
<p>f˛ˇ D �fˇ˛ (8.1)
</p>
<p>which is Newton&rsquo;s third law of motion. The total force on star ˛ is the sum of forces
from all the other stars,
</p>
<p>F˛ D
X
</p>
<p>ˇI ˇ&curren;˛
f˛ˇ (8.2)
</p>
<p>The sum notation means that ˇ runs over all values from 1 to N , except for the case
when ˇ matches ˛. Thus, the equation of motion for star ˛ is
</p>
<p>d2r˛
dt2
</p>
<p>D �
X
</p>
<p>ˇI ˇ&curren;˛
</p>
<p>Gmˇ
</p>
<p>jr˛ � rˇj3
.r˛ � rˇ/ (8.3)
</p>
<p>With ˛ running from 1 toN , this constitutes the complete set of equations of motion
for the system. It is a system of N coupled second-order differential equations.
</p>
<p>8.1.2 Conservation of Energy
</p>
<p>Aswe have seen before, analyzing energy can be a goodway to understand a system.
The kinetic and potential energies for the N -body problem are
</p>
<p>K D 1
2
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>˛
</p>
<p>m˛jv˛j2 and U D �

</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>˛;ˇI ˛&curren;ˇ
</p>
<p>Gm˛mˇ
</p>
<p>jr˛ � rˇj
(8.4)
</p>
<p>In the expression for potential energy, the sum runs over all values of ˛ and ˇ except
when they match each other. The factor of 1=2 enters because the sum in this form
counts each pair of stars twice. When we compute a sum like this, we can exchange
the indices ˛ and ˇ everywhere and still get the same result. In other words for the
potential energy we can write
</p>
<p>U D �1
2
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>˛;ˇI ˛&curren;ˇ
</p>
<p>Gm˛mˇ
</p>
<p>jr˛ � rˇj
D �1
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>˛;ˇI ˛&curren;ˇ
</p>
<p>Gmˇm˛
</p>
<p>jrˇ � r˛j
</p>
<p>We will use this index switching trick a few times below.
In Sect. 2.2 we saw conservation of energy as a general principle, but now we
</p>
<p>ask whether and how it holds in a complicated N -body system. To test energy
conservation, we clearly need to compute the time derivative of the total energy.
Evaluating dK=dt and dU=dt from Eq. (8.4) gives:</p>

</p>
<p>˛;ˇI ˛&curren;ˇ
f˛ˇ � v˛
</p>
<p>In the second step we exchange the indices ˛ and ˇ in the second term. In the third
step we use Eq. (8.1). In the last step, we notice that the two terms are identical and
combine them.
</p>
<p>Now going back to Eq. (8.5), we can write

<p>The quantity in parentheses vanishes by Eq. (8.2), leaving
</p>
<p>dE
</p>
<p>dt
D 0
</p>
<p>Thus energy is in fact conserved.While the final result is not surprising, the analysis
itself is enlightening as we learn to handle complex systems. Seeing the analysis also
helps us remember that what is conserved is the total energy of all stars. Stars can
exchange energy, both between kinetic and potential and among different stars, so
conservation of energy does not apply to individual objects. But it does apply to the
system as a whole.</p>

</p>
<p>In the second step we split the sum into two identical terms and then exchange the
indices ˛ and ˇ in the second term. In the third and fourth lines we combine the
two terms and simplify. In the last step we realize that what we have is the total
gravitational potential energy. So when we go back to Eq. 8.6 we have

<p>2K C U D dQ

</p>
<p>Now consider averaging over time � . If f .t/ is some function of time, we define the

<p>When we take the time average of Eq. (8.8) we obtain:

</p>
<p>D 0 for � ! 1
</p>
<p>At the last step we assume that Q remains finite, so the whole quantity vanishes if
we average over a long enough time interval (because of the � in the denominator).
We do not actually have to know anything about Q except that it remains finite, as
it should for a well-behaved system.
</p>
<p>The bottom line from this analysis is:
</p>
<p>2 hKi C hU i D 0 (8.10)
</p>
<p>This is known as the virial theorem. It looks a little bit like conservation of energy,
but it is quite different. Conservation of energy is instantaneous, whereas the virial
theorem describes the average properties of a system. Also, the virial theorem has
that funny factor of two.
</p>
<p>One way in which the virial theorem is like conservation of energy is that it is
exact (at least for time-averaged quantities). It is not a result of dimensional analysis,
estimation, or approximation.While we will sometimes employ it for estimation, the
virial theorem is really much deeper.
</p>
<p>8.1.4 A Simple Application: N = 2
</p>
<p>The derivation above holds for any N � 2, so the virial theorem ought to apply to
the familiar two-body problem. For simplicity, first consider a two-body problem
with a large central mass M , and a small mass m � M in a circular orbit with
radiusR; this is effectively a one-body problem.We have seen that the orbital speed
is v D
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>GM=R, so the kinetic and potential energies are
</p>
<p>K D 1
2
mv2 D GMm
</p>
<p>2R
and U D �GMm
</p>
<p>R
</p>
<p>Because the orbit is circular, these quantities are constant in time, so hKi D K and
hU i D U . Clearly the virial theorem is satisfied: 2 hKi C hU i D 0.
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s relax the conditions and allow for elliptical orbits with two bodies
of arbitrary masses, m1 and m2. We showed in Chap. 4 that this problem can be
expressed as an equivalent one-body problem with a reduced mass � orbiting a
fixed total mass M . With elliptical orbits, the speed and separation, and hence the
kinetic and potential energies, vary with time but we can compute their average as
follows. From Sect. 4.1.3 we know the potential energy is</p>

<p>The virial theorem is satisfied for the general two-body problem (as it must be).
</p>
<p>8.2 Elliptical Galaxies
</p>
<p>The N D 2 example was a case in which we already knew the complete motion.
The power of the virial theorem becomes more apparent when N � 2 and a
complete, exact description of the motion is not available. Let&rsquo;s see how it leads to
a motion!mass principle for elliptical galaxies. We will study a spherical system
with radius R and total mass M , but similar concepts apply to ellipsoidal systems
(with some geometric complications that are not essential here).
</p>
<p>8.2.1 Potential Energy
</p>
<p>When we average over time, the individual stars blur out and we get what looks
like a smooth mass distribution. If the system is in equilibrium, we can compute the
potential energy for the corresponding smooth case and take that to be hU i.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine building the distribution of stars by assembling spherical shells
like the layers of an onion. Suppose we have a sphere of radius r and enclosed mass
M.r/, and we add to it a shell of thickness dr and density �.r/. The mass of this new
layer is
</p>
<p>dm D 4�r2�.r/ dr
</p>
<p>If we bring the shell in from infinity, its gravitational potential energy is
</p>
<p>dU.r/ D �GM.r/ dm

</p>
<p>D �4� GM.r/ �.r/ r dr</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>134 8 N-Body Problem: Elliptical Galaxies

<p>The total potential energy is found by summing all the shells,

Z R
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>M.r/ �.r/ r dr (8.12)
</p>
<p>For an infinite distribution, we extend the integral to R! 1 as long as the density
falls off faster than � / r�2 (otherwise the integral diverges). The potential energy
depends on how the mass is distributed, so let&rsquo;s examine two simple examples.
</p>
<p>Example: Uniform Density Sphere with Radius R
</p>
<p>Here the density is

<p>hU i D �� GM

</p>
<p>R
(8.15)
</p>
<p>where � is a dimensionless factor of order unity that depends on the density profile.
We have seen that � D 1 for an isothermal sphere and � D 3=5 for a uniform sphere;
other distributions can lead to other values for �.
</p>
<p>8.2.2 Kinetic Energy
</p>
<p>In a reference frame centered on the galaxy, the total kinetic energy is

</p>
<p>(8.16)
</p>
<p>What we can measure with the Doppler effect is the dispersion in the component
of velocity along the line of sight (which we take to be the z-axis). The dispersion
among all stars is
</p>
<p>�2 D 1
N
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>˛
</p>
<p>v2˛z (8.17)
</p>
<p>Stars may not contribute equally to our measurements, though. Brighter stars will
contribute more of the light we receive, and fainter stars less. Therefore it may be
better to think of a luminosity-weighted dispersion,
</p>
<p>�2 D

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>136 8 N-Body Problem: Elliptical Galaxies
</p>
<p>where L˛ is the luminosity of star ˛. If the stars are identical, this reduces to
Eq. (8.17). As defined, � is instantaneous. We do not actually see � change (on
human time scales) because we are summing over so many stars, so we take �2 and
˝
</p>
<p>�2
˛
</p>
<p>to be equivalent.
In order to relate hKi to what we can measure, we need to make two assumptions.
</p>
<p>First, we need to assume something about how the components of velocity
in the x and y directions relate to what we measure in the z direction. The
simplest possibility is that the orbits are arranged so the motion is isotropic and
˝

<p>v2˛y
</p>

</p>
<p>. Second, we need to assume something about the distribution
</p>
<p>of star masses and luminosities. The simplest possibility is that the stars are
identical. If we assume identical stars undergoing isotropic motion, we can combine
Eqs. (8.16) and (8.17) to write
</p>

</p>
<p>Relaxing the two assumptions, we write the general case as
</p>
<p>hKi D 3
2
ˇM�2 (8.19)
</p>
<p>where ˇ is a dimensionless factor that depends on the arrangement of orbits and
population of stars.
</p>
<p>8.2.3 Mass Estimate
</p>
<p>Plugging Eqs. (8.15) and (8.19) into the virial theorem yields
</p>
<p>3ˇM�2 � � GM

</p>
<p>R
D 0
</p>
<p>Rearranging, we obtain the virial mass estimate
</p>
<p>M D 3ˇ
�
</p>
<p>R�2
</p>
<p>G
(8.20)
</p>
<p>The factor R�2=G is what we would derive from dimensional analysis. Now we
identify the dimensionless factors (ˇ and �) that encode the internal properties of the
system. For an isothermal sphere composed of identical stars with isotropic motion,
ˇ D � D 1. For other scenarios, ˇ and � can take on different values.
</p>
<p>Equation (8.20) gives the motion/mass connection for elliptical galaxies. Once
we measure the size (R) and motion (�), we can use the formula to estimate the
mass. When astronomers discuss elliptical galaxies, they usually quote the velocity
dispersion because it is directly measurable, and&mdash;as we now know&mdash;it is a good
indicator of the mass.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.3 Galaxy Interactions 137
</p>
<p>Here are some typical numbers for elliptical galaxies:
</p>
<p>� D 200 kms�1
</p>
<p>R D 10 kpc
</p>
<p>M D 3 � .10 � 3:09 � 10
19m/ � .200 � 103ms�1/2
</p>
<p>6:67 � 10�11m3 kg�1 s�2
</p>
<p>D 6 � 1041 kg
D 3 � 1011 Mˇ
</p>
<p>(This mass estimate is derived with ˇ D � D 1.)
</p>
<p>8.3 Galaxy Interactions
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s shift attention from a single, isolated galaxy to a pair of galaxies
that interact with one another. This is a natural step for two reasons. First,
elliptical galaxies are thought to be formed by collisions between spiral galaxies.
Second, studying galaxy interactions illustrates how the virial theorem can teach us
something interesting and perhaps unexpected.
</p>
<p>8.3.1 Fly-By
</p>
<p>First consider an interaction in which two galaxies fly past one another but do
not collide.3 The encounter has two effects: the gravitational attraction gives each
galaxy a global impulse in the direction of the other galaxy, and the tidal force
squeezes each galaxy. What happens to the internal properties of each galaxy?
</p>
<p>Suppose the encounter is fast enough that the stars within a given galaxy do
not move very much during the event. Then the potential energy is the same just
before and just after the encounter. The kinetic energy changes, though, because
each star gets a little velocity &ldquo;kick.&rdquo; Part of this is collective motion (the whole
galaxy moves), but part of it is internal motion (from tidal squeezing). The key
implication is that the encounter increases the internal kinetic energy.4
</p>
<p>3This analysis follows Binney and Tremaine [2].
4Note that the internal energy of each galaxy is not conserved during the encounter. The total
energy of the system is conserved, though; the &ldquo;new&rdquo; internal energy comes at the expense of the
translational kinetic energy of the two galaxies moving past each other.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>138 8 N-Body Problem: Elliptical Galaxies
</p>
<p>Before the encounter, a galaxy is in equilibrium with
</p>
<p>state #1 kinetic energy hKi D Ki
potential energy hU i D Ui
</p>
<p>equilibrium ) 2Ki C Ui D 0 (8.21)
</p>
<p>Immediately after the encounter, the galaxy has
</p>
<p>state #2 kinetic energy Ki C&#129;K
potential energy Ui
</p>
<p>The system no longer satisfies the virial theorem, so it is not in equilibrium. It must
redistribute the energy to achieve a new equilibrium. It will settle into a final
state with
</p>
<p>state #3 kinetic energy hKi D Kf
potential energy hU i D Uf
</p>
<p>equilibrium ) 2Kf C Uf D 0 (8.22)
</p>
<p>We can combine the virial theorem with conservation of energy5 to obtain two
equations that allow us to find the final state:
</p>
<p>virial theorem W 2Kf C Uf D 0
conservation of energy W Kf C Uf D Ki C&#129;K C Ui
</p>
<p>Subtract these two equations:
</p>
<p>Kf D �Ki �&#129;K � Ui
D �Ki �&#129;K � .�2Ki/
D Ki �&#129;K
</p>
<p>In the second step we use Eq. (8.21) to replace Ui D �2Ki . Once we know Kf we
can use Eq. (8.22) to find Uf :
</p>
<p>Uf D Ui C 2&#129;K
</p>
<p>5Once the encounter is complete, energy must again be conserved. Thus, energy is conserved
between states #2 and #3 even if it is not conserved between states #1 and #2.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.3 Galaxy Interactions 139
</p>
<p>Long after the encounter, the galaxy settles into a state with lower kinetic energy and
higher potential energy. Since U D ��GM=R2, the system must increase R and/or
redistribute mass (thereby changing �) in order to increase the potential energy.
Either way, we realize that the galaxy has been &ldquo;puffed up&rdquo; by the encounter. This
is a conclusion that is interesting and not at all obvious, and it comes from very
general reasoning. Such is the power of the virial theorem.
</p>
<p>8.3.2 Collision
</p>
<p>What happens when two galaxies meet each other head-on? Galaxies are mostly
empty space, so they pass right through one another; it is very unlikely that
one star will actually hit another (see Problem 8.4). But stars can pass close
enough to change each other&rsquo;s motions. The stellar orbits are dramatically dis-
rupted, creating a final state that can be very different from either of the initial
galaxies.
</p>
<p>There are so many stars, and the interactions are so complicated, that it is
difficult to make much progress analytically. Theoretical studies of galaxy collisions
therefore rely on numerical simulations [3,4]. Computers are good at the large-scale
computations needed to track the motions of stars throughout a collision. The benefit
of the numerical approach is that we can make movies and see all the stages of the
merger event. The drawback is that the details depend onmany factors, including the
galaxies&rsquo; masses, velocities, rotation rates, and orientations. Each simulation takes
a lot of computer time, so the idea is to do a plausible range of examples and then
try to extract some general conclusions. For example, one common aspect is the
formation of long, coherent structures called &ldquo;tidal tails&rdquo; that last for a few hundred
million years before settling back into the final galaxy.
</p>
<p>Observational studies investigate systems that appear to be collisions in progress
(see Fig. 8.1). While we cannot follow a single event from start to finish, we can
find observed systems that look like various stages of the simulated mergers, and
vice versa. By identifying such matches, we can validate the simulations and also
make educated guesses about what happened in the past and what will occur in
the future for each system. The general lessons are that galaxies can collide, the
collision process drastically changes the motions of stars in the galaxies, and the
end product is a system full of stars with seemingly random motions that resembles
conventional elliptical galaxies (e.g., [5]).</p>

</p>
<p>8.4 Other N-Body Problems
</p>
<p>Gravitational N -body problems also occur in many other astrophysical settings,
ranging from star clusters within galaxies, to the formation and evolution of galaxies
themselves, to clusters and superclusters of galaxies, and finally to the large-scale
distribution of matter in the universe. Computer simulations, coupled with analytic
tools like the virial theorem, allow us to understand astrophysical processes over a
huge range of scales. You can explore a few examples in the problems below.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>8.1. You should be able to answer these questions using the virial theorem, without
doing any detailed calculations.
</p>
<p>(a) For a system in virial equilibrium, is the total energy positive, negative, or zero?
(b) Suppose a system is in equilibrium. In order for the system to shrink in size,
</p>
<p>how must the total energy change?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Problems 141
</p>

<p>�.r/ D 3M

</p>
<p>a2
</p>
<p>.r2 C a2/5=2
</p>
<p>whereM is the total mass, and a is a core radius.
</p>
<p>(a) Compute the enclosed mass profileM.r/. Hint: by changing variables, you can
express the integral in a form that can be evaluated using Sect. A.7.
</p>
<p>(b) Now compute the total potential energy in terms of G, M , and a. Hint: again
change variables and use Sect.A.7.
</p>
<p>(c) If the mass distribution is in equilibrium, what is the total kinetic energy?What
is the total energy? Give your answers in terms of G,M , and a.
</p>
<p>(d) The globular cluster ! Centauri can be described by a Plummer model with a
total mass M D 5 � 106Mˇ and core radius a D 4:5 pc. Assuming identical
stars in isotropic orbits, find the cluster&rsquo;s radial velocity dispersion � in km s�1.
</p>
<p>8.3. Some time in the future, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies will collide.
While we need computer simulations to study the process in detail, we can get an
idea of what the end product will be like.
</p>
<p>(a) For an isothermal sphere with a radius R and circular velocity v, express the
potential and total energies in terms ofM and v.
</p>
<p>(b) Consider two identical finite isothermal spheres, each with initial mass Mi
and initial circular velocity vi , that are at rest a distance d apart. What is the
total energy of this system? Hint: consider the total energy for each object in
isolation, and then the potential energy between the two.
</p>
<p>(c) Suppose the two spheres fall toward each other and merge, and after some time
they equilibrate into a single isothermal sphere. Use conservation of mass and
energy along with the virial theorem to derive the following quantities, and
explain your results in words:
</p>
<p>&bull; The final massMf (in terms of the initial massMi )
&bull; The final circular velocity vf (in terms of vi , Ri , and d )
&bull; The final radius Rf (in terms of Ri and d )
</p>
<p>(d) Apply your results to a system like theMilkyWay and Andromeda, approximat-
ing the galaxies as isothermal spheres with circular velocities of 250 kms�1 and
radii of 150 kpc, which fall from rest at an initial separation of 780 kpc. What
are the mass (in Mˇ), radius (in kpc), and circular velocity (in km s�1) of the
final galaxy? (This is not a perfect model of the MilkyWay/Andromeda system,
because the two galaxies are not identical and they are already heading toward
each other. Nevertheless, it gives a reasonable idea of how things will go.)
</p>
<p>8.4. I mentioned that when two galaxies come together they do not physically
hit each other, but gravitational interactions change the star motions. Let&rsquo;s make
some estimates to understand what would happen if an interloper passed through</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>142 8 N-Body Problem: Elliptical Galaxies
</p>
<p>the Milky Way&rsquo;s disk in the vicinity of the Sun.6 The mass density in stars near the
Sun is about 0:05Mˇ pc�3 [7]. For simple estimates you may assume the disk has
a uniform density and is 1 kpc thick, and all stars are like the Sun.
</p>
<p>(a) As seen from above, what fraction of the area of the disk is covered by stars?
This can be interpreted as the probability that a star passing through the disk
would hit a disk star.
</p>
<p>(b) Even if the interloper does not hit a disk star, it may pass close enough to
change the disk star&rsquo;s motion. Let&rsquo;s suppose this happens if the gravity from
the interloper ever exceeds the gravity from the galaxy. Show that this occurs if
the interloper comes within a distance
</p>
<p>d � .GmRgal/
1=2
</p>
<p>vc
</p>
<p>of the disk star, where m is the mass of the disk star, Rgal is the distance of the
disk star from the center of the galaxy, and vc is its circular rotation speed.
</p>
<p>(c) Now estimate the probability that the interloper perturbs a disk star while it
passes through the disk.
</p>
<p>The key result here is that bona fide collisions between stars are rare, but interactions
that change stars&rsquo; motions are common.
</p>
<p>8.5. The Coma cluster of galaxies has a velocity dispersion of about 1;000 kms�1
</p>
<p>and a radius of about 3Mpc. Estimate its total mass assuming an isothermal sphere
with isotropic orbits of identical galaxies. Would your estimate increase, decrease,
or stay the same if you used a constant density model?

<p>Bending of Light by Gravity
</p>
<p>To this point we have examined how massive objects move under the influence of
gravity. Einstein taught us that light&rsquo;s motion is affected by gravity as well. Despite
being relativistic, gravitational light bending can be studied with a quasi-Newtonian
framework to obtain a new way to probe mass in the universe.
</p>
<p>9.1 Principles of Gravitational Lensing
</p>
<p>The gravitational deflection of light can be treated as a variant of the Newtonian
one-body problem.A full relativistic analysis gives a deflection angle that is twice as
large (see Sect. 10.6.5), but for most astrophysical purposes we can insert the factor
of 2 by hand and proceed in the Newtonian framework. In this section we identify
observable effect of light bending including distortion, magnification, and multiple
imaging.
</p>
<p>9.1.1 Gravitational Deflection
</p>
<p>Consider a particle of mass m passing near a massive bodyM � m. The particle&rsquo;s
trajectory is curved, but asymptotically (i.e., far from M ) it is a straight line. We
can quantify the bending in terms of the angle Ǫ between the asymptotic segments,
as shown in Fig. 9.1. To compute Ǫ , strictly speaking we need to solve a differential
equation characterizing the motion.1 If the bending is small, however, we can obtain
a good approximation much more simply, by computing the change in velocity
perpendicular to the original motion.
</p>
<p>1This is related to the analysis in Sect. 3.1, but now applied to an unbound orbit.

<p>Fig. 9.1 Setup for calculating the deflection when a particle of mass m passes near a massive

closest approach on the original trajectory. The position shown has t &lt; 0
</p>
<p>Let the particle&rsquo;s speed be v. Consider the point of closest approach on the
original trajectory: let the distance of this point from M , known as the impact
parameter, be b; and let the time at this point be t D 0. The component of the

Therefore, we expect light to be bent by gravity.2
</p>
<p>This analysis used Newtonian gravity. The analysis with general relativity
(see Sect. 10.6.5) gives a bending angle that is the same for a massive particle, but a
factor of 2 larger for a massless particle (like light). Therefore we can say:

<p>It is possible to develop the theory of gravitational lensing in a relativistic framework
(e.g., [1]), but for lensing by stars and galaxies it is adequate (and much simpler) to
work in the Newtonian framework and insert the factor of 2 for light.3
</p>
<p>Example: Deflection of Light by the Sun
</p>
<p>The nearest object that creates measurable light bending is the Sun. Light from a
distant star that passes just outside the surface of the Sun is deflected by the angle

<p>Such starlight is normally swamped by light from the Sun, but it becomes visible
during a solar eclipse. Frank Dyson and Arthur Eddington led expeditions to
measure the positions of stars during an eclipse in 1919 [3]. They found that the
positions were shifted (relative to the standard positions when the Sun is not present)
by amounts that were consistent with Einstein&rsquo;s predictions (see Fig. 9.2). This
measurement and a similar one by Campbell et al. during a 1922 eclipse [4] are
considered to be among the classic tests of general relativity (see Sect. 10.4).
</p>
<p>2You might wonder whether it makes sense to take the limit of the gravitational force as m ! 0,
but in general relativity we learn that energy gravitates.
3Gravitational lensing by black holes does require a full relativistic treatment (see [2] for a review).</p>

<p>Fig. 9.2 The left panel shows a photographic negative from the solar eclipse of 1919. Although
they are hard to see, star positions are marked. Comparing the positions in this picture with those
measured when the Sun is not in the way yielded the deflections plotted in the right panel. (Note
that the horizontal axis is inverted so stars closer to the Sun are plotted toward the right) (Credit:

</p>
<p>9.1.2 Lens Equation
</p>
<p>If the impact parameter is small enough, light can go around both sides of the lensing
mass and still reach Earth. In such strong lensing,4 we see what appears to be the
same light coming from two different directions, so we detect two images of the
background source.
</p>
<p>To quantify this effect, let Dl and Ds be the distances from the observer to the
lens and source, respectively, and Dls be the distance from the lens to the source.
Using the small-angle approximation,we can define various distances perpendicular
to the line of sight as shown on the left-hand side of Fig. 9.3. If we assume Euclidean
geometry, we can write down the relation
</p>
<p>Dsˇ D Ds� �Dls Ǫ .�/
</p>
<p>where we write Ǫ .�/ to remind ourselves that the deflection angle depends on the
impact parameter, which in turn depends on � . Rewriting this very slightly, we have
</p>
<p>ˇ D � � ˛.�/ (9.2)
</p>
<p>4&ldquo;Strong&rdquo; is a relative term; the bending angle is still in the small-angle regime.</p>

<p>Fig. 9.3 The geometry of strong gravitational lensing. In this example, light can take two paths
from the source (on the left) to the observer (on the right). The angle from the lens to the source
is ˇ, the angle from the lens to an observed image is � , and the deflection angle is Ǫ . The distance
from the observer to the lens is Dl , from the observer to the source is Ds , and from the lens to
the source isDls . The lengths shown on the left assume the small-angle approximation

<p>where we define the scaled deflection angle

</p>
<p>Ǫ .�/ (9.3)
</p>
<p>For lensing by galaxies, we cannot use Euclidean geometry to describe the expand-
ing universe through which the light rays move. However, the bending happens
only in close proximity to the galaxy, over a distance that is a small fraction of
the total distance traveled. We can therefore view the trajectory as two &ldquo;straight&rdquo;
lines (as generalized to an expanding universe) that are connected by a sharp bend.
This is known as the thin lens approximation. It allows us to interpret Eq. (9.2)
in a cosmological context provided that we take the distances Dl , Ds , and Dls to
be cosmological angular diameter distances (see Sect. 11.3.2 for details). The key
point for now is that angular diameter distances do not add in a simple way, so
Dls &curren; Ds �Dl for cosmological lensing
</p>
<p>In Fig. 9.3 all the light rays lie in a plane, which is true if the gravitational field
is spherically symmetric and the force is purely radial. In general that may not be
the case, but we can keep the same form of the lens equation if we interpret all the
angles (ˇ, � , and ˛) as 2-dimensional vectors in the plane of the sky. In other words,
� has two components .�1; �2/ that measure angles in the east/west and north/south
directions, respectively (and similar for ˇ and ˛). This general form of the lens
equation serves as the foundation for the theory of gravitational lensing. The vector
form of ˛ acts as a 2-d analog of the gravitational force, so in the same way that we
define a potential via F D �rU in 3-d, we can define a lens potential in 2-d via
</p>

<p>9.1.3 Lensing by a Point Mass

the gravitational one-body problem to light bending. The scaled deflection angle is

<p>We will interpret this quantity momentarily. For now, it lets us write the lens
equation as

</p>
<p>Rearranging gives

<p>Consider the case ˇ D 0, so the solutions are �˙ D ˙�E . In this case the observer,
lens, and source all lie on a line, so we can rotate the system around that line and
have perfect symmetry. In other words, there are images that appear all the way
around the lens, forming a perfect Einstein ring image. Since �E gives the angular
size of the ring, we call it the angular Einstein radius.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.1 Principles of Gravitational Lensing 149
</p>
<p>In the general case ˇ &curren; 0, notice that
</p>
<p>�C � �E and � �E � �� &lt; 0
</p>
<p>TheC image is always outside the Einstein ring, while the� image is always inside
the Einstein ring and on the other side of the lens (as indicated by the minus sign).

<p>If we observe two lensed images, and we know the distances involved, we can
compute the mass of the lens. This is the motion!mass principle for gravitational
lensing. What is different now is that we are using the motion of light to measure
mass.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 9.4, the left and middle columns show examples of lensing by a point
mass. Each source produces two images, one on the same side of the lens as the
source and outside �E , the other on the opposite side and inside �E . The exception
is a source directly behind the lens, which produces a complete Einstein ring. The
right column shows an example in which the gravitational field is not spherically
symmetric, which we will examine below. In that case lensing can produce four
images for certain source positions. Figure 9.5 shows an example of an observed
4-image lens system.
</p>
<p>9.1.4 Distortion and Magnification
</p>
<p>In Fig. 9.4 we see that lensed images can be stretched, and in Fig. 9.5 we see that
images of a single source can have different brightnesses. Thus, the observable
effects of lensing include distortion and magnification. To illustrate how these occur,
Fig. 9.6 shows the images of a straight arrow source behind a point mass lens. The
outer image is created when each piece of the source arrow is pushed radially
outward until it lies beyond the Einstein radius. The image subtends the same</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>150 9 Bending of Light by Gravity
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.4 Examples of strong gravitational lensing. The top row shows arrays of sources, while
the bottom row shows the resulting lensed images (colored the same as the sources). In the left
and middle columns, the lens is a point mass; the dashed circle indicates the Einstein radius.
The difference is whether the sources are offset from or aligned with the middle of the lens.
A source directly behind a circular lens produces an Einstein ring (bottom middle). In the right
column, the lens is an ellipsoidal galaxy model; the dashed curves indicate the &ldquo;critical curves&rdquo; (in
the image plane) and &ldquo;caustics&rdquo; (in the source plane). A source within the inner caustic produces
four images
</p>
<p>azimuthal angle as the source,5 but since it lies at a larger radius it winds up being
longer. The inner image is created when each piece of the source is pushed radially
&ldquo;through&rdquo; the center of the lens. Again the image subtends the same azimuthal angle
as the source, but it can lie close to the center and thus be short, or it can lie near
(but inside) the Einstein radius and thus be relatively long (as in the example).
Notice that the outer image gets distorted but retains the same orientation as the
source. By contrast, the inner image gets flipped upside down while keeping the
same left/right orientation as the source. There is no way to obtain this image by
distorting and rotating the source, so we say the parity (or handedness) of the inner
image has been reversed.
</p>
<p>5Having the image subtend exactly the same azimuthal angle as the source requires a radial
deflection and thus is limited to circular lenses. The concept of tangential stretching is general,
though.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 9.6 Example of lensing distortion and magnification. The straight red arrow shows the
source; the curved blue arrows show the two lensed images. The outer image has the same parity
as the source, but the inner image has the opposite parity. The dashed circle indicates the Einstein
radius. The dotted lines show that, for a spherical lens, each part of the source yields two images
on radial lines
</p>
<p>To quantify these effects, consider a small displacement&#129;ˇ in the source plane.

<p>In Problem 9.1 you can learn that � &gt; 0 makes a source look bigger; it is related to
focusing of light, so it is known as convergence. By contrast, &#13;C and &#13;� cause
a source to look distorted, so they are known as shear. Strictly speaking, the
convergence and shear describe what happens to a source that is small enough for
.�; &#13;C; &#13;�/ to be constant across the source, but they offer an intuitive sense of what
happens to larger sources as well.
</p>
<p>Lensing conserves surface brightness (it merely redirects photons, without
creating or destroying any), so if a small source has surface brightness I and area
dAsrc and it leads to an image with area dAimg, then the ratio of fluxes is
</p>
<p>fimg
</p>
<p>fsrc
D I dAimg
I dAsrc
</p>
<p>D dAimg

<p>Thus we define

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.1 Principles of Gravitational Lensing 153
</p>
<p>to be the lensing magnification such that the ratio of fluxes is fimg=fsrc D j�j.
We could make the absolute value part of the definition of �, but it is convenient
to let � be a signed quantity because the sign reveals the parity of the image. If
the source is large enough that we can resolve the images, then we observe the
shapes directly and so we work with A itself. By contrast, if the source is small
and we cannot resolve the images, then we only measure fluxes and so we work
with �. Using Eq. (9.12) we can write the magnification in terms of the convergence
and shear:

</p>
<p>Circular Symmetry
</p>
<p>If the lens has circular symmetry, the potential and deflection are functions of
� D .�21 C �22 /1=2. Then working out the derivatives and using some trigonometry
(see Problem 9.2) gives

</p>
<p>Recall that the Einstein radius satisfies �E �˛.�E/ D 0, so at the Einstein radius the
first factor vanishes and hence the magnification diverges. For an image near but not
precisely at �E , the magnification will be finite but it can be large. This is reflected in
the size and shape of images near the Einstein radius in Fig. 9.4. In multiply-imaged
quasars it is not uncommon for the brightest images to have magnifications of 10
or 20, and in some cases of microlensing (Sect. 9.2) magnifications of hundreds or
even thousands have been recorded [6, 7].

<p>Recall that the C image has �C � �E , so the denominator is positive, and indeed
the entire quantity is larger than 1; this image is always brighter than the source.
By contrast, the � image has j��j � �E , so the denominator and hence the
magnification is negative. The sign reflects the parity reversal. There is no lower
bound on j�j for the � image, so this image can be bright or faint. For both images,
when � approaches �E the magnification gets arbitrarily large.</p>

</p>
<p>9.1.5 Time Delay
</p>
<p>Looking back at Fig. 9.3, notice that each light ray is longer than it would have been
if it went straight from the source to the observer. Also, each light ray experiences a
relativistic phenomenon called gravitational time dilation (see Sect. 10.2.3). The two
effects cause the light to take longer to reach us along the lensed path than it would
have along the direct route (without lensing). The excess light travel time, which is
called the lens time delay, is

<p>where zl is the cosmological redshift of the lens (see Sect. 11.3.1). The first term in
square brackets quantifies the extra distance the light has to travel, while the second
term encodes gravitational time dilation.
</p>
<p>Usually we cannot measure the time delay itself, because we cannot know how
long it would have taken the light to reach us without lensing, but we can measure
the differential time delay between two images. Time delays are thus another
observable aspect of lensing, although we will not say much more about them here.
One conceptual point is that time delays provide a new way to think about where
the lens equation comes from. By Fermat&rsquo;s principle, light will &ldquo;choose&rdquo; trajectories
that correspond to stationary points of the travel time function.6 The condition
r� D 0 immediately yields � � ˇ � r D 0, which is the lens equation (9.5).
In other words, images form at stationary points of the time delay surface.
</p>
<p>9.2 Microlensing
</p>
<p>In the remainder of this chapter we examine several ways in which gravitational
lensing can be used to investigate matter that is difficult or impossible to observe
directly. Let&rsquo;s begin in our own Milky Way galaxy. Once galaxy rotation curves
gave evidence for dark matter, people begin to wonder what the extra mass is made
of. Two competing hypotheses emerged7:
</p>
<p>&bull; MACHOs, or Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects. According to this
hypothesis, dark matter is composed of astrophysical objects that are faint but
otherwise familiar. Possibilities include: brown dwarf stars, which are balls of
</p>
<p>6You may be familiar with the principle of least time, but local minima are not the only stationary
points. As a function of two dimensions, � can also have local maxima and saddle points.
7Don&rsquo;t blame me&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t invent the names! For the record, &ldquo;WIMP&rdquo; was introduced first, and
&ldquo;MACHO&rdquo; was chosen deliberately (see [8]).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.2 Microlensing 155
</p>
<p>gas that are too small to support nuclear fusion, so they do not shine (see
Problem 16.5); white dwarf stars, which are dim stellar corpses (see Sect. 17.2);
planets; or black holes.
</p>
<p>&bull; WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. According to this hypothesis,
dark matter is a fundamental particle that is unfamiliar to us. There are many
hypothetical particles that could have the right properties to act as dark matter,
including neutralinos, axions, gravitinos, and much more (see [9]).
</p>
<p>If dark matter is made of MACHOs, the Milky Way should be rife with objects the
mass of planets or stars that can cause a form of lensing known as microlensing.
If dark matter is instead made of WIMPs, it should be spread more diffusely, which
would limit microlensing to events produced by stars. Measuring the rate of lensing
in our own galaxy can therefore help us distinguish between MACHO and WIMPy
dark matter.
</p>
<p>9.2.1 Theory
</p>
<p>Consider using a star in the MilkyWay as the source of light, and either another star
or a MACHO in the foreground as the lens. In a typical scenario the source is a star
in the bulge of our galaxy, which is about 8 kpc away, and the lens is a star roughly
halfway in between. The Einstein radius for a solar mass star is then
</p>
<p>�E D

</p>

� rad
</p>
<p>� 3600 arcsec
1 deg
</p>
<p>D 0:001 arcsec
</p>
<p>Since the Einstein radius is so small, the images are too close together to be resolved
(even with the Hubble Space Telescope). As the source and lens move through
the galaxy, though, the positions and brightnesses of the images change with time.
We can detect microlensing through variations in the apparent brightness of the
source star.
</p>
<p>Problem 9.4 you can practice solving the lens equation to predict the changes in
brightness as the source moves relative to the lens. For now let us focus on the time
scale for variability. The natural scale is the time it takes for the source and lens to
move (relative to the each other) by the diameter of the Einstein ring. Since �E is the
angular Einstein radius, the corresponding length isDl�E . The speed that matters is
the relative velocity of the lens and source perpendicular to the line of sight, which
we write as v?. The typical Einstein crossing time is therefore</p>

<p>For the typical values quoted above and v? D 200 kms�1, the time scale is tE D
70 days. This is quite convenient: short enough that impatient astronomers do not
have to wait too long, but long enough that they can make many measurements
during the course of an event even if some nights are lost to bad weather.
</p>
<p>9.2.2 Observations
</p>
<p>The biggest observational challenge is the low probability for any given star to be
microlensed (which you can estimate in Problem 9.5). If you watch enough stars
over a long enough period of time, however, you are bound to see some events. The
prospect of testing the MACHO hypothesis was tantalizing enough to lead several
groups to make a concerted effort to look for microlensing. Three of the main teams
were the MACHO Project, the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE),
and Exp&eacute;rience pour la Recherche d&rsquo;Objets Sombres (EROS). To give a sense of
scale: the MACHO Project monitored about 17 million stars toward the center of the
MilkyWay for 3 years and observed 99 events, and also monitored almost 12 million
stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, a small galaxy orbiting the Milky Way)
for almost 6 years and observed 13&ndash;17 events (depending on the selection criteria)
[10,11]. Looking toward the Galactic Center raised the odds that the team would see
at least a few events and thus validate their observational methods, while looking
toward the LMC let them look through the Milky Way&rsquo;s halo to search for MACHO
dark matter.
</p>
<p>Two sample microlensing events are shown in Fig. 9.7. Each star was observed
in both red and blue light to distinguish lensing from other effects. Light bending
is independent of wavelength, so a microlensing event ought to look the same in
both red and blue light.8 Most of the time the light curve is constant (revealing the
star&rsquo;s natural flux). But during a period of a few months the star brightens, reaches
a peak, and then fades back to its original flux. The measured data points nicely
follow the predicted microlensing light curve. For each event, we can measure the
peak magnification, which depends on how close the source star came to the lens,
and the duration of the event, which depends on a combination of the mass of the
lens, the distances, and the relative velocity (see Eq. 9.18). While this information
does not uniquely determine the mass of the lens star, it does at least confirm that
we saw microlensing.
</p>
<p>As we said, the idea is to see whether the number of microlensing events is
comparable to or higher than the number expected from known populations of stars
in the Milky Way. The analysis is necessarily detailed; suffice it to say that the
</p>
<p>8By contrast, variable stars tend to change color as they change brightness.</p>

</p>
<p>microlensing event rate is much lower than expected if all the dark matter were
MACHOs [11]. There may be some but not very many MACHOs in the Milky Way.
Dark matter, it seems, is mostly WIMPy.
</p>
<p>9.2.3 Binary Lenses
</p>
<p>Observed light curves do not always match standard predictions as well as the
ones in Fig. 9.7. Many of them have features that arise when the lens star has
a companion: either another star or a planet. The gravitational field for a binary
lens is sufficiently complicated that we cannot predict the light curve analytically.
Nevertheless, we can understand some of the distinctive phenomena that occur in
binary lensing.
</p>
<p>Consider the case of two equal mass stars, and a source star directly behind the
center of mass. The resulting image configuration is shown in Fig. 9.8. Image #1
appears right in the middle because the gravity from the star on the right cancels the
gravity from the star on the left. Image #2 appears where it does because both stars
pull the light to the right; and vice versa for image #3. For image #4, both stars pull
down, while the leftward and rightward forces cancel; and vice versa for image #5.
</p>
<p>The key concept is that there can be five images. This is true not only for a source
right between the stars, but also for some other positions. As shown in Fig. 9.9, there</p>

<p>is a region in the source plane that leads to five images, and another region that leads
to three. The boundary between them is called a caustic curve in the source plane.
Caustics map to critical curves in the image plane, which are like the Einstein ring
but generalized to scenarios without circular symmetry. Caustics mark where the
number of images changes. A source just inside a caustic produces two images near
a critical curve that are highly magnified and distorted. (If the source straddles the
caustic, the two imagesmerge into one that crosses the critical curve.) Consequently,
the lensing magnification can change dramatically from one side of the caustic to
the other.</p>

<p>Fig. 9.10 Light curve for a binary microlensing event. The vertical axis is labeled magnification
but is actually 2:5 log j�j, so the highest points correspond to magnifications of around 40.
The colored points show data from different telescopes. The curve shows a binary lens model.
In the inset, the two upper panels show results for different filters, while the bottom panel shows
the residuals between the data and model (Credit: Kubas et al. [13]. Reproduced with permission
c&#13; ESO)
</p>
<p>We can see this as a sharp change in the magnification when a source moves
across a caustic during a microlensing event, as shown in Fig. 9.10. The main
plot shows the full light curve. The inset shows a close-up of the caustic crossing
event; the colored points show the data, while the black curve shows a theoretical
prediction. Remarkably, the light curve depends not only on the properties of the
lens (the masses and positions of the two stars), but also on the structure of the
source. At any given time the part of the source that is right on the caustic is
dramatically magnified. As the source moves across the caustic, different portions
of its surface are magnified in turn, and the light curve essentially maps the surface
of the star (in the direction of motion, at least). In this way microlensing effectively
boosts the resolving power of our telescopes to help us study structures that would
otherwise be too small to see.
</p>
<p>9.2.4 Planets
</p>
<p>If we reduce the companionmass to the scale a planet, the caustics shrink to the point
that the gravity from the planet just produces a &ldquo;blip&rdquo; on the light curve. The time
scale for the planetary feature, compared to the full stellar event, is</p>

<p>For the Sun and Jupiter, the mass ratio translates into a duration ratio of tplanet=tstar D
0:031. With the typical numbers from Sect. 9.2.1, the planetary event would last
about tplanet � 2 days. For the Sun and Earth, the numbers are tplanet=tstar D 0:0017
and tplanet � 3 h.
</p>
<p>Planetary microlensing events are short enough that they require continuous
monitoring by telescopes around the world. To do this efficiently, microlensing
observers developed a strategy in which the main teams would observe their large
samples of stars once a week or so. When they spotted a star in the early stages
of a microlensing event, they would broadcast an alert so that other teams could
begin using other telescopes to monitor the event very closely. This strategy has
paid off with the discovery of more than a dozen microlensing planets so far [14].
Figure 9.11 shows a planetary event discovered in August 2005 after an alert from
the OGLE team.
</p>
<p>Beyond merely detecting a planet, what did they learn from this event? The
most well-constrained quantity is the mass ratio between the planet and star, which
basically comes from the ratio of time scales [15]:
</p>
<p>Mplanet
</p>
<p>Mstar
D .7:6˙ 0:7/ � 10�5
</p>
<p>To estimate the actual masses of the star and planet, the team had to make a detailed
model of the population of stars in the galaxy and figure out which ones are most
likely to produce an event like the one seen. This yielded

<p>Mstar D 0:22C0:21�0:11 Mˇ and Mplanet D 5:5C5:5�2:7 M˚</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.3 Strong Lensing 161
</p>
<p>The uncertainties are significant: the planet could be only a few times more massive
than Earth, or more than 10 times more massive. This is the best that can be done
without direct knowledge of the distance to the lens or the relative velocity between
the lens and source. Still, it allows the important conclusion that this planet is in the
same league as Neptune.
</p>
<p>While microlensing has revealed fewer exoplanets than the Doppler and transit
techniques (see Sect. 4.3), it serves as a valuable complement.Microlensing involves
completely different physical processes and observational methods, so it provides
independent confirmation that other stars have planets. Also, microlensing is more
sensitive to small planets far from their stars. Finally, microlensing is better able
to examine stars that are far from Earth. The main drawback is that we only see a
microlensing event once, when the star and planet cross in front of a background
source; after the event concludes, it cannot be repeated. Therefore microlensing will
probably contribute more to a statistical census of planets rather than to detailed
knowledge of individual systems. Nevertheless, microlensing is expected to play an
increasingly important role in planet searches in the coming decade.
</p>
<p>9.3 Strong Lensing
</p>
<p>With stars and planets it is reasonable to use the point mass approximation, but
when we turn to galaxies and clusters of galaxies we must consider extended mass
distributions.
</p>
<p>9.3.1 Extended Mass Distribution
</p>
<p>We can still work in the thin lens approximation, so what matters is the projected
surface mass density of the galaxy, ˙ . A small patch of the lens at position � 0 has
mass ˙.� 0/ d� 0, so the amount of bending it creates at � is

<p>162 9 Bending of Light by Gravity
</p>
<p>We call this the critical surface density for lensing, for reasons that will become
clear shortly. If we take the divergence r � ˛ and recall that the deflection is related
to the lens potential by ˛ D r , we obtain
</p>
<p>r2 D 2 ˙

</p>
<p>(9.21)
</p>
<p>This has the form of the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential, but in two
dimensions. It provides the general framework for lensing by arbitrary 2-d mass
distributions. By comparing Eqs. (9.13a) and (9.21), we see that the convergence is
the surface mass density scaled by the critical density:
</p>
<p>� D ˙
˙crit
</p>
<p>(9.22)
</p>
<p>9.3.2 Circular Mass Distribution
</p>
<p>For a mass distribution with circular symmetry, we can evaluate Eq. (9.19) using
an analog of Newton&rsquo;s theorem about gravity from a spherical mass distribution.
Recall from Sect. 2.3 that Newton found F.r/ / M.r/=r2 whereM.r/ is the mass
enclosed within r . The radial dependence is 1=r2 because a certain &ldquo;amount of
gravity&rdquo; is spread over a spherical shell whose area scales as r2. By analogy, in 2-d
the dependence should be 1=R, or in terms of the angular impact parameter 1=� .
Indeed, the scaled deflection from a circular mass distribution is
</p>

</p>
<p>Dls
</p>
<p>DlDs
</p>
<p>M.�/
</p>

</p>
<p>Recalling that the Einstein radius is defined by ˛.�E/ D �E , we can write

<p>M.�E/ D
c2
</p>
<p>4G
</p>
<p>DlDs
</p>
<p>Dls
�2E (9.24)
</p>
<p>If we see an Einstein ring, we can infer the mass enclosed by the ring even if we
do not know the density profile. If we do not see a complete ring, the principle still
holds that the quantity we measure best is the mass within �E . This is how we can
use gravitational lensing as a tool to weigh distant galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
</p>
<p>Consider the average surface mass density enclosed by the Einstein ring (in angu-
lar units, e.g., solar masses per square arcsecond):

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.3 Strong Lensing 163
</p>
<p>All Einstein rings enclose an average density that is given by ˙crit from Eq. (9.20).
Put another way, an object must have ˙ � ˙crit in order to have an Einstein ring
at all. This is the sense in which˙crit is the critical density for lensing.
</p>
<p>9.3.3 Singular Isothermal Sphere
</p>
<p>A specific example of an extended, circular mass distribution is the Singular
Isothermal Sphere (SIS), which we first encountered when studying spiral galaxies
(Sect. 7.3.2). With spiral galaxy rotation curves we used the (softened) isothermal
model as one part of a multi-componentmodel that also included contributions from
a disk and bulge. With lensing we can often get away with even simpler models,
because we mostly deal with elliptical galaxies where the stellar distribution is
roundish like the dark matter halo, we focus on the total mass distribution (light
bending depends only on the total amount of matter, not whether it is luminous
or dark), and we only need to know the projected surface mass density. For all of
these reasons, the singular isothermal sphere (and its generalization to an ellipsoid;
Sect. 9.3.4) turns out to be a valuable model for lensing. An isothermal sphere with
circular velocity vc has a 3-d density profile9

<p>We can then write the lens equation as:
</p>
<p>� &gt; 0 W ˇ D � � �E (9.25a)
� &lt; 0 W ˇ D � C �E (9.25b)
</p>
<p>Without loss of generality we can take ˇ � 0. Then we can solve Eq. (9.25a) to find
one of the images:
</p>
<p>�C D ˇ C �E
</p>
<p>We can also solve Eq. (9.25b):
</p>
<p>�� D ˇ � �E only if ˇ � �E
</p>
<p>(If ˇ &gt; �E this equation would imply �� &gt; 0, which would violate the condition in
Eq. 9.25b.) A singular isothermal sphere, in other words, can produce three types of
configurations:
</p>
<p>ˇ D 0 W Einstein ring at �E
0 &lt; ˇ � �E W two images at �˙ D ˇ ˙ �E
</p>
<p>ˇ &gt; �E W one image at �C D ˇ C �E
</p>
<p>Whereas a point mass lens always produces two images, an SIS lens creates two
images only for sources in a finite region behind the lens.
</p>
<p>9.3.4 Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid
</p>
<p>Few galaxies are perfectly spherical, and new lensing phenomena appear when
spherical symmetry is broken (see Figs. 9.4 and 9.9), so it worthwhile to consider the
case of ellipsoidal symmetry. With circular symmetry the surface mass density˙ is
a function of the polar radius � D .�21 C �22 /1=2. To make the symmetry elliptical
instead, we can write ˙ in terms of the ellipse coordinate � D .�21 C �22=q2/1=2
where 0 &lt; q � 1 is a dimensionless parameter that measures the ratio of the short
and long axes: for q D 1 the model is again spherical, but for q &lt; 1 it is flattened.
</p>
<p>With elliptical symmetry it can be difficult to evaluate the integral in Eq. (9.19).
The singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) is one case that can be treated analytically,
leading to the lens equation [16]

<p>While these expressions are admittedly non-intuitive, the main conceptual point is
straightforward: a source at the origin yields four images, with two on the horizontal
axis and two on the vertical axis. Figure 9.4 shows that other source positions can
also yield four images.
</p>
<p>9.3.5 Spherical Galaxy with External Shear
</p>
<p>We can capture a lot of the same phenomenology using simpler algebra if we revert
to a spherical model but account for the gravitational influence of other galaxies that
happen to lie near the main lens galaxy. If the neighboring galaxies lie more than a
few Einstein radii away, their effects can be characterized using a tensor of the form
given in Eq. (9.12) where �, &#13;C, and &#13;� are constant across the main lens galaxy.10
</p>
<p>If we choose coordinates such that &#13;� D 0, the lens equation has the form
</p>
<p>10The shear is basically a tidal effect analogous to what we studied in Chap. 5.</p>

</p>
<p>We can now examine how the &ldquo;external&rdquo; shear11 influences the number of images.
Typical values of external shear are &#13; � 0:01&ndash;0:1. In what follows we set � D 0 for
simplicity, because it does not actually affect the image multiplicity.
</p>
<p>For a source at the origin, an analysis similar to what we did in Sect. 9.3.4 yields
four images:

</p>
<p>˙ �E
1C &#13; ; 0
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>A source on the horizontal axis can be treated analytically as well. In Problem 9.6
you can find the following results:
</p>
<p>&bull; For 0 � ˇ1 &lt; 2&#13;�E=.1 � &#13;/ there are four images. Two are on the �1-axis and
two are off the axis.
</p>
<p>&bull; For 2&#13;�E=.1 � &#13;/ &lt; ˇ1 &lt; �E there are two images, both on the �1-axis.
This helps you understand the different configurations seen in Fig. 9.4, as well
as the transition between two and four images. There is one additional type of
4-image configuration that is produced by an off-axis source, but it is usually found
numerically.
</p>
<p>We have considered ellipticity or shear, but real lenses may have both. Quantita-
tively, both ellipticity and shear are often required to fit observed 4-image lenses in
detail. Qualitatively, though, the two models we have considered capture the main
phenomenology of 4-image lensing.
</p>
<p>9.3.6 Science with Galaxy Strong Lensing
</p>
<p>Several hundred cases of strong lensing by galaxies have now been observed; in
some the source is a quasar or other compact source that is lensed into multiple
distinct images, while in others the source is a galaxy that is lensed into a partial
or complete Einstein ring. The majority of lens galaxies are ellipticals because such
galaxies tend to be more massive, and hence better lenses, than spirals.
</p>
<p>So far in this chapter we have assumed a mass distribution and solved for the
image positions. When we study observed lenses, we invert the problem: we take
</p>
<p>11&ldquo;External&rdquo; because it comes from outside the main lens galaxy (i.e., from the neighbors). Note
that we drop the subscript on &#13; to simplify the notation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.3 Strong Lensing 167
</p>
<p>the images as given and try to solve for the mass distribution that produced
them. It impossible to uniquely determine the mass distribution, though; there
are just too many unknowns. To make progress, we often adopt assumptions that
limit the unknowns.12 For example, if we assume the lens is a point mass or
singular isothermal sphere then we only need to solve for the mass or velocity
dispersion (respectively).We can make the model more complicated by addingmore
parameters: for example, moving from an isothermal profile to a general power
law adds one parameter; allowing the mass distribution to be elongated adds two
(ellipticity and orientation angle); accounting for external shear adds another two
(shear strength and direction); and so forth. A lot of the art and science of strong
lens modeling lies in choosing assumptions whose restrictions are useful but not
oversimplified, incorporating observational and/or theoretical knowledge from other
realms of astrophysics.
</p>
<p>Strong lens modeling has taught us a number of lessons about galaxy mass
distributions (see the review by Treu [18]; you can explore some aspects of
lens modeling in Problem 9.7). Themost robust quantity we canmeasure is the mass
within the Einstein radius, M.�E/. By comparing the mass inferred from lensing
with the mass associated with the starlight, we can find evidence that lens galaxies
contain dark matter. The next step is to learn how the dark matter is distributed. One
approach is to recognize that �E varies from one lens to another (it depends not only
on the lens mass but also on the distances between the observer, lens, and source);
if we assume lenses follow certain scaling relations, we can use the variousM.�E/
measurements to infer the average mass profile. Another approach is to combine
lensing with an analysis of stellar dynamics, which tends to be sensitive to the mass
closer to the center of a galaxy (see Sect. 8.2.3). Having mass measurements at small
radii from dynamics and somewhat larger radii from lensing provides important
information about the mass profile in individual systems. All told, models suggest
that lens mass distributions are nearly isothermal, so the dark matter halos are more
extended than the visible galaxies.
</p>
<p>We noted above that many lens models require both ellipticity and external shear.
Constraints on shear let us investigate the distribution of matter in the vicinity of a
lens, which is interesting because lens galaxies often lie in gravitationally bound
&ldquo;groups&rdquo; containing a few dozen galaxies [19]. Lensing therefore helps us study
how galaxies form and evolve in environments that play an important role in galaxy
evolution.
</p>
<p>12An alternative approach is to make as few assumptions as possible (although assumptions can
never be avoided altogether), and then deal with the large range of mass models that are consistent
with the observed images [17].</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>168 9 Bending of Light by Gravity
</p>
<p>9.4 Weak Lensing
</p>
<p>To this point we have considered situations in which the impact parameter is small
and light bending is strong enough to create multiple images. At larger impact
parameters, lensing still acts but the effects are more subtle. Consider an array of
source galaxies as shown in the left panel of Fig. 9.12. Putting a lens in front yields
the picture shown on the right. Only sources near the center are multiply imaged,
but sources farther out are still distorted. This is the regime known as weak lensing.
</p>
<p>There is not much we can learn from individual sources that are weakly lensed.
The observed shape of an image depends not only on the lensing distortion but
also on the intrinsic shape of the source, and it is difficult or impossible to
distinguish the two effects on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis (see Fig. 9.13).We can make
progress, though, by examining collections of galaxies. Weak lensing distortion
is predominantly tangential (perfectly so in the case of a spherical lens), whereas
intrinsic shapes and orientations are random.13 Therefore if we measure the shapes
of galaxies in polar coordinates centered on a lens, the intrinsic shapes should
average out while the lensing distortions will not.
</p>
<p>One way to study weak lensing is to collect galaxies into annuli centered on the
lens, compute the average shape in each annulus, and relate that to the lensing shear.
As you can show in Problem 9.2, the shear is related to the density for a circular
lens by
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.12 The left panel shows an array of source galaxies. The right panel shows what we would
see if there were a gravitational lens in front. One source produces an Einstein ring, a few are
multiply imaged, but most are only slightly distorted (&ldquo;weak lensing&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>13We hope. Correlations among the intrinsic shapes of galaxies could present a challenge for weak
lensing [20, 21], but they are generally expected to be small and there are ways to deal with them
in a weak lensing analysis [22].</p>

<p>9.4 Weak Lensing 169
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.13 Similar to Fig. 9.12, but the source galaxies have random positions, shapes, and
orientations. The images are no longer perfectly tangential, but the overall pattern of distortion
is still apparent

Ṅ .r/ �˙.r/
</p>
<p>˙crit
(9.28)
</p>
<p>where Ṅ .r/ is the average surface mass density within radius r . Measuring the shear
profile clearly provides information about the density profile of the lens.
</p>
<p>A more sophisticated approach is to observe a large sample of galaxies, collect
them in bunches on the sky, and measure the full shear map (at a spatial resolution
that is limited by the sample size). If we know both &#13;C and &#13;� as a function of
position, we can view Eqs. (9.13b) and (9.13c) as a pair of differential equations that
can be solved for the lens potential,  . We can then use Eq. (9.21) to uncover the
underlying mass distribution,˙ . This general analysis cannot be done analytically,
but it is well suited to computational methods (e.g., [23]).
</p>
<p>The challenge of weak lensing is that its statistical nature provides less detailed
information about lens mass distributions, compared with strong lensing. The ben-
efit is that there are many, many more objects in the universe that are weakly
lensed than objects that are strongly lensed. As a result, weak lensing has become a
widespread and important tool for studying dark matter. This is especially true for
clusters of galaxies, which are the most massive bound objects in the universe and
thus good targets for weak lensing (see the review by Kneib and Natarajan [24]).
</p>
<p>Figure 9.14 shows a famous weak lensing system known as the &ldquo;bullet cluster,&rdquo;
which provides arguably the clearest evidence that dark matter is real. The system
contains two clusters of galaxies that passed through each other some 100 million
years ago; the cluster on the left is moving to the left, and the one on the right is
moving to the right. Each cluster contained hot gas that can be mapped because it</p>

is a map of the hot X-ray gas (colored red) and the dark matter inferred from weak lensing (colored

<p>emits X-rays (colored red in the image). During the &ldquo;collision&rdquo; the two gas clouds
slammed into one another, but the galaxies and dark matter did not feel gas pressure
so they kept on going. As a result, the X-ray gas got separated from the galaxies and
dark matter.
</p>
<p>How does lensing apply? There are lots and lots of small background galaxies in
the field (although they are too small and faint to be apparent in Fig. 9.14). A weak
lensing analysis yields the mass distributions indicated in blue in the image [25].
There is a significant offset between the hot gas, which represents the bulk of the
normal matter in the clusters, and the source of gravity. This is exactly what we
would expect if there is a significant amount of dark matter that exerts gravity but is
otherwise inactive. Most astrophysicists conclude that it would be very difficult to
explain the weak lensing result in the bullet cluster and similar systems [26] without
exotic dark matter (but see [27] for a dissenting view).
</p>
<p>Strong and weak lensing are most apparent near massive objects like galaxies
and clusters, but gravitational deflection actually affects all light rays in the universe
at some level. Inhomogeneities in the large-scale distribution of matter create
distortions that are quite small but detectable with a careful statistical analysis of
galaxy shapes [28]. This cosmic shear is sensitive to the relative abundances of
dark matter and dark energy in the universe, so it plays a prominent role in existing
and planned probes of cosmology [29]. The analysis methods are more detailed than
we want to get into here, but the fundamental principle is just what we have used
throughout this chapter: mass creates gravity that bends light, so if we can detect the
light bending we can use it to map the matter and weigh the universe.</p>

Milky Way&rsquo;s dark matter is made of MACHOs. In this problem you will estimate
the microlensing probability. (This is analogous to Problem 8.4, with the interloper
star replaced by a light ray.)
</p>
<p>(a) Suppose there is a uniformmass density � in MACHOs between us and a source
a distanceDs away. Consider a thin slab that is located a distanceDl away and
has thickness dDl . Find the fraction of the area of the slab that is covered by
the Einstein rings of MACHOs. This is the probability that the light ray passes
within one Einstein radius of one of the MACHOs in the slab, i.e., close enough
to be strongly lensed. Hints: �E is the angular Einstein radius, but here you need
to convert it to a length; the result does not depend on the mass of theMACHOs.</p>
<p/>

<p>(b) Now sum up all the slabs between us and the source, i.e., integrate overDl . The
resulting quantity is called the &ldquo;optical depth&rdquo; for microlensing, often written
as � , and it represents the probability that a light ray passes close enough to a
MACHO to be lensed.
</p>
<p>(c) To compute a numerical value of � you need to specify the mass density in
MACHOs. To make a simple estimate, assume that dark matter is distributed
uniformly between the Sun and the center of the Milky Way, and compute the
mean density. Also assume that all of the mass is in MACHOs (i.e., don&rsquo;t worry
about the disk). With these assumptions, calculate �.

microlensed by a MACHO.

have four. The simplest lens that can produce four images is an isothermal sphere
with an external shear, whose lens equation is given by (9.27). Recall that &#13; is
dimensionless, and we can take it to be positive.
</p>
<p>(a) Consider a source placed on the horizontal axis in the source plane (i.e.,
ˇ2 D 0). Solve the lens equation (working with symbols) to show that:
&bull; For 0 � ˇ1 &lt; 2&#13;�E=.1 � &#13;/ there are four images. Two are on the �1-axis
</p>
<p>and two are off the axis.
&bull; For 2&#13;�E=.1� &#13;/ &lt; ˇ1 &lt; �E there are two images, both on the �1-axis.
Give the positions of all images in both cases.

Sketch the image configurations for the following source positions:

to measure galaxy masses. Imagine you observe a galaxy lens system with distances
Dl D 940Mpc, Dls D 1;293Mpc, and Ds D 1;745Mpc. One image appears at an
angular position of �C D 1:0500 from the lens galaxy, while the other appears at an
angular position �� D �0:3500 on the opposite side of the galaxy. You may assume
the lens is circularly symmetric.

<p>(a) Assume the galaxy can be modeled as a point mass. Find the Einstein radius
and mass of the lens galaxy.

<p>Chapter 10
</p>
<p>Relativity
</p>
<p>With his special and general theories of relativity, Einstein revolutionized our
understanding of space, time, gravity, and hence motion. Why, then, have we
spent so much time with Newton? Newtonian physics is a good approximation
when motion is slow compared with the speed of light and gravity is &ldquo;weak&rdquo; in
a sense to be defined. A lot of astrophysics research is still carried out under these
assumptions. That said, discussing our modern conception of gravity and motion
opens fascinating topics such as the weirdness of spacetime around black holes and
(in Chap. 11) the expanding universe.1
</p>
<p>10.1 Space and Time: Classical View
</p>
<p>All of our discussion of motion so far has relied on an implicit understanding of
&ldquo;space&rdquo; and &ldquo;time.&rdquo; Intuitively, we think everyone agrees on what space and time
are; we imagine there are universal rods and clocks we can use to define them.
Although physicists knew that only relative motion matters for inertial observers,
they assumed that a universal, absolute reference frame does exist.
</p>
<p>To glimpse some consequences of this assumption, let&rsquo;s examine the relation
between two inertial reference frames that are moving relative to each other.
Consider one frame .x; y; z; t/, and a second frame .x0; y0; z0; t 0/ moving relative
to the first with a constant speed u in the x-direction. If time and space are the
same in both frames, the coordinates must be the same except for a translation in
the x-direction:

<p>This is referred to as the Galilean transformation between reference frames.
A direct corollary is

</p>
<p>The velocity with respect to the unprimed frame is the simple sum of the velocity
with respect to the primed frame, plus the velocity of the primed frame with respect
to the unprimed frame. This certainly makes sense intuitively.
</p>
<p>If we take a second derivative, we find
</p>
<p>d2x
</p>
<p>dt2
D d
</p>
<p>2x0
</p>
<p>dt 02
</p>
<p>so the accelerations are the same in both frames. Then by Newton&rsquo;s second law the
net force must likewise be the same, and the laws of physics are equally valid in
either frame.
</p>
<p>This all made sense until physicists studied electricity, magnetism, and light in
the late nineteenth century. On the theoretical side, James Clerk Maxwell&rsquo;s theory of
electrodynamics indicated that light is an electromagnetic wave traveling at speed
c D 3:0 � 108ms�1 in all inertial reference frames. On the experimental side,
Albert Michelson and Edward Morley tried to measure differences in the speed of
light emitted by sources moving at different speeds&mdash;and found that there were
no differences. Physicists were stunned. Some suggested there must be a problem
in Maxwell&rsquo;s theory. Others supposed there was some substance known as &aelig;ther
pervading the universe whose properties caused all inertial observers to measure the
same speed of light.
</p>
<p>10.2 Special Theory of Relativity
</p>
<p>Albert Einstein took a different approach: he wondered whether the problem lay in
misconceptions about space and time. Instead of assuming absolute space and time,
he took an operational view: he described how to use a system of rigid rods and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.2 Special Theory of Relativity 179
</p>
<p>synchronized clocks to construct a coordinate system in any reference frame.2 To
Einstein, space and time could be real only to the extent that they could be measured.
</p>
<p>That only served to define coordinates within a given reference frame. To relate
different reference frames, Einstein proposed two postulates [4]:
</p>
<p>1. The equations of motion of any (mechanical) system are the same in all inertial
reference frames.
</p>
<p>2. The speed of light is constant and universal.
</p>
<p>The first postulate is called the principle of relativity, and it predated Einstein.
What Einstein did was introduce the second postulate as an extension of the theory
of electrodynamics, and show that together the two postulates are inconsistent with
the Galilean transformation.
</p>
<p>10.2.1 Lorentz Transformation
</p>
<p>Einstein worked out what different observers would have to say about space and
time in order for them to agree on the speed of light. He found the relations:
</p>
<p>ct D &#13; ct 0 C &#13; ˇ x0 (10.1a)
x D &#13; x0 C &#13; ˇ ct 0 (10.1b)
y D y0 (10.1c)
z D z0 (10.1d)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>ˇ D u
c
</p>
<p>and &#13; D
�
</p>
<p>1 � ˇ2
��1=2
</p>
<p>(10.2)
</p>
<p>Note that we use ct and ct 0 because working with a quantity that has dimensions
of length clarifies the interplay between time and space coordinates. The inverse
relations are:
</p>
<p>ct 0 D &#13; ct � &#13; ˇ x (10.3a)
x0 D &#13; x � &#13; ˇ ct (10.3b)
y0 D y (10.3c)
z0 D z (10.3d)
</p>
<p>2Peter Galison [3] notes that, as a clerk in the Swiss Patent Office, Einstein probably saw many
patent applications for schemes to synchronize clocks. The spread of the railroad and telegraph had
prompted a need for long-distance synchronization.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>180 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>The relations (10.1) and (10.3) were already known as the Lorentz transformation
after Hendrik Lorentz. They had been derived in electrodynamics as the transforma-
tion that preserves Maxwell&rsquo;s equations in both reference frames.3 What Einstein
offered was a sweeping new interpretation: time and space are no longer separate,
absolute quantities. Rather, they are linked in a 4-dimensional structure we now call
spacetime. Points in spacetime are referred to as events. (We will say more about
the structure of spacetime beginning in Sect. 10.5.)
</p>
<p>We can use the Lorentz transformation to relate velocities measured in the primed
and unprimed frames. The differential version of Eq. (10.1) is
</p>
<p>c dt D &#13; c dt 0 C &#13; ˇ dx0
</p>
<p>dx D &#13; dx0 C &#13; ˇ c dt 0
</p>
<p>dy D dy0
</p>
<p>dz D dz0
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s rewrite these relations using the components of velocity measured in the
primed frame: v0x D dx0=dt 0, v0y D dy0=dt 0, and v0z D dz0=dt 0. We also use ˇ D u=c.
These substitutions yield
</p>
<p>dt D
�
</p>
<p>1C uv
0
x
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>&#13; dt 0

<p>dx D

<p>v0x C u
�
</p>
<p>&#13; dt 0
</p>
<p>dy D v0y dt 0
</p>
<p>dz D v0z dt 0
</p>
<p>Now we can find the velocity components in the unprimed frame:
</p>
<p>vx D
dx
</p>
<p>dt
D v
</p>
<p>0
x C u
</p>
<p>1C uv0x=c2

<p>vy D

dz
</p>
<p>dt
D
</p>
<p>v0z
&#13;.1C uv0x=c2/
</p>
<p>(10.4c)
</p>
<p>Under the Lorentz transformation, velocity in the unprimed frame is no longer a
simple sum of the velocity in the primed frame and the velocity of the frame itself.
In Problem 10.2 you can see how the modified transformation explains why the
speed of light does not depend on the speed of the source.
</p>
<p>3Maxwell&rsquo;s equations are not invariant under the Galilean transformation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.2 Special Theory of Relativity 181
</p>
<p>Non-relativistic Limit
</p>
<p>Our experience and intuition are more closely aligned with the Galilean transforma-
tion than the Lorentz transformation, but of course they are associated with motion
that is slow compared with the speed of light. Let&rsquo;s see if we can confirm our
intuition by examining the Lorentz transformation when u=c � 1. A Taylor series
expansion of Eq. (10.1) yields
</p>
<p>t � t 0 C ux
0
</p>
<p>c2
C O
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>u2
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>and x � x0 C ut 0 C O
�
</p>
<p>u2
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>Since the speed of light is so large, ux0=c2 is small and to a very good approximation
we can write
</p>
<p>t � t 0 and x � x0 C ut
</p>
<p>A similar analysis applied to Eq. (10.4) yields
</p>
<p>vx � v0x C u vy � v0y vz � v0z
Thus, the Lorentz transformation does not actually invalidate the Galilean trans-
formation (which is reassuring since the latter was the basis of all physics prior to
the twentieth century). Rather, it clarifies that the Galilean transformation should be
used only when motion is slow compared with the speed of light.
</p>
<p>10.2.2 Loss of Simultaneity
</p>
<p>When speeds are not small, however, we must use the full Lorentz transformation.
Following Einstein, we can use some gedanken (German for &ldquo;thought&rdquo;) experiments
to uncover some consequences of the interplay between space and time. First,
consider two lights that are set up to flash at the same time in the primed coordinate
system (which we can take to be t 0 D 0). What are the times of the flashes in the
unprimed coordinate system? Let the first event be the flash of light #1:
</p>
<p>event 1: .t 0; x0/ D .0; x01/ ) ct1 D &#13; ˇ x01
</p>
<p>Let the second event be the flash of light #2:
</p>
<p>event 2: .t 0; x0/ D .0; x02/ ) ct2 D &#13; ˇ x02
</p>
<p>The time between the two flashes is &#129;t 0 D 0 in the primed frame, but the time
between the two flashes in the unprimed frame is
</p>
<p>c &#129;t D &#13; ˇ .x02 � x01/ &curren; 0</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>182 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>In other words, events that are simultaneous in one reference frame are not
simultaneous in other reference frames. This is the first indication that there is
something decidedly non-intuitive in the new way of thinking about the universe.
</p>
<p>10.2.3 Time Dilation
</p>
<p>Now focus on a single flashing light and consider the time between flashes. For
simplicity, let&rsquo;s put the light at the origin of the primed frame. If we again consider
two flashes as two spacetime events, we have:
</p>
<p>event 1: .t 0; x0/ D .0; 0/ ) t1 D 0
event 2: .t 0; x0/ D .&#129;t 0; 0/ ) t2 D &#13; &#129;t 0
</p>
<p>In other words, the time between flashes as measured in the unprimed frame is
</p>
<p>&#129;t D &#13; &#129;t 0 (10.5)
</p>
<p>Since &#13; � 1, more time passes between flashes in the unprimed frame than in the
primed frame. This effect is known as time dilation. If we think of a flashing light
as a kind of clock, we can distill this into the maxim &ldquo;moving clocks run slowly.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>If the measurement of time between events depends on the reference frame, how
can we single out a frame to focus on when we study physical laws? The most
natural quantity is the time interval measured by a clock at rest with respect to the
events, which has the advantage of being the smallest time interval that any clock
will measure. We call this the proper time.
</p>
<p>Time dilation is a definite and weird prediction of relativity, so it deserves to
be tested experimentally. One of the classic tests was performed in 1963, when
David Frisch and James Smith [5] studied elementary particles called muons coming
from space. Frisch and Smith compared the number of muons detected at the top
of Mt. Washington in New Hampshire (1,907m above sea level) with the number
detected at sea level. It takes a certain amount of time &#129;t for muons to travel the
intervening distance, but the measurements indicated that the muons &ldquo;experienced&rdquo;
a much shorter interval &#129;t 0 &lt; &#129;t . The experiment confirmed predictions of time
dilation, as you can see in more detail in Problem 10.3. In 1971, Joseph Hafele and
Richard Keating [6, 7] flew atomic clocks on airplanes to do a more controlled test
of time dilation. That experiment involved gravity as well as motion, so we will
consider it among tests of general relativity (Sect. 10.4.5). Today, relativistic time
dilation is built into the Global Positioning System (Sect. 10.4.6).</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.2 Special Theory of Relativity 183
</p>
<p>10.2.4 Doppler Effect
</p>
<p>In a final use of the flashing light, let&rsquo;s consider the times when flashes reach an
observer who is stationary at the origin of the unprimed frame. This is what the
observer (whether a person or an instrument) would actually measure. The first flash
occurs at coordinates .t 01; x
</p>
<p>0
1/ D .t 01; 0/ in the primed frame, which correspond to
</p>
<p>coordinates .t1; x1/ D .&#13; t 01 ; &#13; u t 01/ in the unprimed frame. In order for this flash to
be observed, it must travel to the observer at the origin. The distance it must travel
is &#13; u t 01, and the time it takes is &#13; u t
</p>
<p>0
1=c. The time at which the flash is observed is
</p>
<p>therefore
</p>
<p>t1;obs D &#13; t 01 C
&#13; ut 01
c
</p>
<p>D &#13;
�
</p>
<p>1C u
c
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>t 01
</p>
<p>By similar reasoning, we find the time at which the second flash is observed to be
</p>
<p>t2;obs D &#13;
�
</p>
<p>1C u
c
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>t 02
</p>
<p>Thus, the time that elapses between observations of the two flashes is
</p>
<p>&#129;t D t2;obs � t1;obs D &#13;
�
</p>
<p>1C u
c
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>&#129;t 0 D
�
</p>
<p>1C u=c
1 � u=c
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>&#129;t 0
</p>
<p>where &#129;t 0 D t 02 � t 01 is the time interval between flashes in the frame in which they
are emitted, and in the last step we substitute for &#13; using Eq. (10.2).
</p>
<p>Now if we replace the flashes with peaks of a wave, the time between peaks is the
inverse of the frequency of the wave: so �obs D 1=&#129;t in the frame of observations,
and �em D 1=&#129;t 0 in the frame of emission. Then we have
</p>
<p>�obs
</p>
<p>�em
D
�
</p>
<p>1 � u=c
1C u=c
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>(10.6)
</p>
<p>Equivalently, in terms of wavelength we can use � / ��1 to write
</p>
<p>�obs
</p>
<p>�em
D
�
</p>
<p>1C u=c
1� u=c
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>(10.7)
</p>
<p>This is the relativistic Doppler effect. It says that if a light source is moving away
from the observer (u &gt; 0), the observed frequency of light is lower than the emitted
frequency; this corresponds to a longer wavelength and hence a redder color, so
we call this a redshift. Conversely, if a light source is moving toward the observer
(u &lt; 0), the Doppler effect produces a blueshift.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>184 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>In the non-relativistic limit, we can use a Taylor series expansion to write
</p>
<p>�obs
</p>
<p>�em
� 1C u
</p>
<p>c
C O
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>u2
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>We often express the shift in terms of the change in wavelength,&#129;� D �obs � �em:
</p>
<p>&#129;�
</p>
<p>�em
� u
c
</p>
<p>(10.8)
</p>
<p>This is the Doppler shift of light when the source of light is moving at non-
relativistic speeds. It is what we use, for example, to measure the motions of stars
and discover that they are orbited by planets (Sect. 4.3.1).
</p>
<p>10.2.5 Length Contraction
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change gedanken tools and consider a ruler oriented along the x-axis that is at
rest in the primed frame. Place one end of the ruler at x01 D 0 and the other end at
x02 D L0, so the ruler&rsquo;s length in the primed frame is L0. What is the length of the
ruler in the unprimed frame? It may seem backward at first, but let&rsquo;s use the Lorentz
transformation x01 D &#13; x1 � &#13; u t1 (and likewise for the other end). Then we have
</p>
<p>x02 � x01 D .&#13; x2 � &#13; u t2/ � .&#13; x1 � &#13; u t1/ D &#13; .x2 � x1/ � &#13; u .t2 � t1/
</p>
<p>It is important to measure the ends of the ruler at the same time in the unprimed
frame. Then we can put t2 � t1 D 0 and obtain
</p>
<p>x02 � x01 D &#13; .x2 � x1/ ) L0 D &#13; L ) L D
L0
</p>
<p>&#13;
</p>
<p>In other words, the moving ruler appears to have a length L D L0=&#13; that is shorter
than its length at rest. This is known as length contraction: moving objects appear
shorter in the direction of motion. As with proper time, if we want to single out a
particular length then we usually use the proper length measured when the object
is at rest.
</p>
<p>10.3 General Theory of Relativity
</p>
<p>In order to deal with gravity, Einstein had to generalize his theory from inertial to
accelerated reference frames. This led him to sophisticated mathematical structures
including non-Euclidean geometry, manifolds, tensors, and more. We will glimpse
some of the mathematical framework in Sect. 10.5, but first let&rsquo;s examine the
physical principles that underlie general relativity.</p>

<p>10.3.1 Concepts of General Relativity
</p>
<p>General relativity is a geometric theory of gravity: acceleration is a consequence
of the curvature of spacetime. There are two key concepts governing the interaction
between curvature and mass (as stated by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler [8]):
</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;Space acts on matter, telling it how to move.&rdquo;
2. &ldquo;In turn, matter reacts back on space, telling it how to curve.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>People often think of these in terms of a rubber sheet analogy. Imagine stretching a
rubber sheet so it lies flat. This is a model of a 2-dimensional universe described by
special relativity. Now place a bowling ball on the sheet. The bowling ball deforms
the sheet; this is point #2 above. Then roll a ping-pong ball near the bowling ball.
The curvature induced by the bowling ball controls how the ping-pong ball moves;
this is point #1.
</p>
<p>It is important to understand that this is an analogy. It is imperfect because it
describes the 2-d rubber sheet as being curved into the third dimension. For the
3-d spatial universe, we would have to think of the curvature as extending into a
fourth spatial dimension. I cannot picture such a thing! Also, the analogy works
only if there is external gravity pulling on the bowling ball to distort the rubber
sheet. In general relativity, everything needs to happen within the theory. So the
rubber sheet is useful as a pictorial analogy, but please do not take it too literally.
We will be more precise about describing curvature soon.
</p>
<p>10.3.2 Principle of Equivalence
</p>
<p>When Einstein was trying to figure out how to describe gravity and acceleration, he
had an important thought: &ldquo;If a person falls freely he will not feel his own weight.&rdquo;
[9] To be more precise, let&rsquo;s go back to Newton for a moment. We have often used
the equation
</p>
<p>GMm
</p>
<p>r2
D F D ma (10.9)
</p>
<p>and cancelled the m&rsquo;s from both sides. But it is not obvious that they have to be the
same. Them on the left describes how an object feels the force of gravity; we might
call it the &ldquo;gravitational mass,&rdquo; mg. The m on the right describes an object&rsquo;s inertia
and how it responds to a force; we might call it the &ldquo;inertial mass,&rdquo; mi . We really
ought to rewrite Eq. (10.9) as
</p>
<p>GMmg
</p>
<p>r2
D Fg D mia</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>186 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>which yields the acceleration
</p>
<p>a D GM
r2
</p>
<p>mg
</p>
<p>mi
</p>
<p>It is an experimental fact that the ratiomg=mi is 1. Galileo is said to have shown this
by dropping balls off the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Modern versions of the experiment
reveal that the difference between gravitational and inertial masses is less than 1 part
in 1012 (e.g., [10]). Therefore we can say to high precision that the acceleration due
to gravity is independent of mass&mdash;all objects fall at the same rate.4
</p>
<p>If that is true, then no experiment can reveal the acceleration because the
equipment will fall at the same rate as the sample. By extension, no experiment
can reveal that gravity is at work! Another way to say this is that a freely falling
laboratory is equivalent to a lab floating in empty space. Within such a freely
falling lab, we can apply the principles of special relativity. This simplifies things
quite a lot.
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this reasoning holds only in a region of space in which the
acceleration due to gravity is uniform. Since objects on the surface of Earth fall
towards the center of the planet, objects at different positions fall in different
directions; that is enough to reveal the gravity. But if we pick a region that is small
enough, these effects are negligible.
</p>
<p>Einstein turned this idea into the foundation of his theory of gravity, calling it the
principle of equivalence:
</p>
<p>&bull; All local, freely falling, non-rotating frames of reference are equivalent for
performing physical experiments.
</p>
<p>This is the fundamental principle that allows us to identify some physical aspects of
general relativity.
</p>
<p>10.3.3 Curvature of Spacetime
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s apply the principle of equivalence to some thought experiments to understand
how gravity affects spacetime. Consider a lab in freefall in a gravitational field where
the acceleration due to gravity is g, as depicted in Fig. 10.1. Suppose a light source
on the left-hand wall is pointed toward the right. By the principle of equivalence,
the lab acts as a local inertial reference frame, so an observer in the lab would see
the light travel in a straight line from one side to the other.
</p>
<p>4This is not true of other forces. Consider the acceleration created by the electric force acting on
an object with mass m and charge q near another charge Q: a D Qq=mr2 does depend on mass.</p>

<p>t = 2
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.1 Setup for gedanken experiment #1. A light ray travels horizontally in a lab that is in
freefall with uniform acceleration. To an observer in the lab, the light ray travels straight across the
room (dotted lines). But to an outside observer, the light ray follows a curved trajectory
</p>
<p>What would be seen by an observer on the ground (who is stationary in the
gravitational field)? As the light moves to the right in the lab, the lab accelerates
downward, so the trajectory of the light looks like a parabola. Gravity has caused
light to curve!
</p>
<p>To be specific, let&rsquo;s write the equation of the trajectory. If the light starts at
.x; y/ D .0; 0/, its position as a function of time is
</p>
<p>x D ct and y D �1
2

</p>
<p>Eliminating t yields
</p>
<p>y D �gx
2
</p>
<p>2c2
</p>
<p>We know this trajectory is curved, but by how much? To quantify curvature, think
about a circle:
</p>
<p>x2 C y2 D R2c ) y D
�
</p>
<p>R2c � x2
�1=2</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>If we know y.x/, we can extract the radius Rc as follows:
</p>
<p>dy
</p>
<p>dx
D � x
</p>
<p>.R2c � x2/1=2
</p>
<p>d2y

<p>at x D 0 W d
2y
</p>
<p>dx2
D � 1
</p>
<p>Rc
</p>
<p>(The minus sign means the circle is curved downward.) As a general rule, then, we
can define the radius of curvature for a trajectory y.x/ as
</p>
<p>Rc D
1
</p>
<p>jd2y=dx2j
Heuristically, Rc is the distance over which the trajectory deviates significantly
from a straight line, so a smaller value corresponds to a greater curvature. For our
gedanken experiment, the radius of curvature is found as follows:
</p>
<p>dy
</p>
<p>dx

</p>
<p>c2

</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>g
</p>
<p>If we assume Newtonian gravity for simplicity, the gravitational acceleration at a
distance r from an object of massM is
</p>
<p>g D GM
r2
</p>
<p>so the radius of curvature for light is
</p>
<p>Rc D
c2r2
</p>
<p>GM
</p>
<p>Example: Earth
</p>
<p>Near the surface of Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is g D 9:80ms�2 so the
radius of curvature for light is
</p>
<p>Rc D
c2
</p>
<p>g
D 9:17 � 1015m D 0:97 ly
</p>
<p>The radius of curvature is huge&mdash;far, far bigger than the size of Earth&mdash;whichmeans
the curvature is quite small. Nevertheless, it is significant enough to produce all the
familiar effects of gravity.</p>

</p>
<p>The radius of curvature is comparable to the size of the event horizon, which means
gravity is strong.
</p>
<p>Bottom line: we have found that gravity causes light to move on a curved
trajectory. A similar analysis could be done for material particles. Operationally,
then, what we mean when we say spacetime is curved is that objects follow curved
trajectories. To summarize:
</p>
<p>objects follow curved trajectories , space is curved
</p>
<p>10.3.4 Gravitational Redshift and Time Dilation
</p>
<p>Consider the same freely falling lab, only now put the light source on the floor and
have it shine upward. By the time the light reaches a detector in the ceiling, the lab
will be moving faster because of the acceleration. If the light moves a distance h, the
time elapsed is t D h=c and the lab&rsquo;s new speed is u D �gt D �gh=c (where the
minus sign means downward). By Eq. (10.6), there should be a Doppler blueshift of
the form
</p>
<p>&#129;�Doppler D �obs � �em D �em
</p>
<p>"

u
</p>
<p>c

</p>
<p>gh
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>(assuming u � c). Here is the crux of this experiment: if there were a Doppler
shift, we would know the lab is accelerating, and that would violate the equivalence
principle. The only way out is to say that gravity causes the frequency of light to
shift by just the right amount to cancel the Doppler shift. In other words, there must
be a gravitational redshift
</p>
<p>&#129;�grav � ��em
gh
</p>
<p>c2
(10.10)
</p>
<p>This actually makes sense physically: light loses energy as it moves against gravity,
and since E / � the frequency must decrease.
</p>
<p>The preceding analysis assumed a constant gravitational acceleration. To deal
with the general case, we can use the gravitational acceleration g D GM=r2 and
change the height to dr and the frequency shift to d�, obtaining

<p>10.4 Applications of General Relativity 191
</p>
<p>To put this number in context: if your life expectancy is 100 years, you would get
to live about 2 s longer on Earth than if you were in space with no gravity. Please
note, though, that your experience of time is unaffected by acceleration or gravity;
you would not actually have more &ldquo;time&rdquo; to enjoy life. You would just appear to age
slowly as seen by those living in weaker gravity, while to you they would seem to
age quickly.
</p>
<p>10.4 Applications of General Relativity
</p>
<p>In the previous section we used gedanken experiments to discover the curvature of
spacetime, gravitational redshift, and gravitational time dilation. Now let&rsquo;s consider
several real experiments that have confirmed these predictions of general relativity.
</p>
<p>10.4.1 Mercury&rsquo;s Perihelion Shift (1916)
</p>
<p>When we studied planetary motion (Chaps. 3 and 4), we said a planet follows a
perfectly elliptical orbit and traces it over and over again. Strictly speaking that
is true only in an ideal two-body problem. When a planet&rsquo;s orbit is dominated by
the Sun but perturbed by another planet, the situation is only approximately two-
body. The resulting orbit can be thought of as an ellipse that precesses, or rotates a
little each time the planet goes around (see Fig. 10.2). We can quantify the effect by
measuring the shift in the perihelion position.5
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.2 An illustration of perihelion shift. Roughly speaking, the orbit is approximately
elliptical but the ellipse rotates with time, which causes the location of perihelion to vary. The
effect shown here is greatly exaggerated, with � D 0:05 (compared with � D 8 � 10�8 for
Mercury)
</p>
<p>5We could use any part of the orbit, but perihelion is distinctive.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>192 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>In our Solar System, the largest perihelion shift is 560 arcsec/century for
Mercury. Most of the shift can be attributed to perturbations from other planets, but
after all the known planets are taken into account a shift of 43 arcsec/century remains
unexplained.Historically, some people speculated that there might be another planet
closer to the Sun than Mercury that caused the additional perihelion shift. The
hypothetical planet was called Vulcan [11].
</p>
<p>When Einstein considered Mercury&rsquo;s orbit in the context of general relativity, he
discovered that it would be described by the equation of motion (see Sect. 10.6.4)
</p>
<p>d2r
</p>

</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>c2r4
</p>
<p>where ` D r2d�=d� is the specific angular momentum, which is conserved. The
first term is standard Newtonian gravity, and the second term is the usual centrifugal
term. The third term is new in general relativity, and it perturbs the orbit away from
a pure ellipse. To see this, let&rsquo;s go all the way back to our analysis of Newtonian
gravity in Chap. 3. Recall that we changed independent variables from time to angle,
and we put r D 1=u. Repeating the analysis yields
</p>
<p>d2r
</p>
<p>d�2
D �`2u2 d
</p>
<p>2u
</p>
<p>d�2
</p>
<p>so the equation of motion becomes

<p>d�2

</p>
<p>`2
C 3GM
</p>
<p>c2

</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s define
</p>
<p>� D 3.GM/

</p>
<p>c2`2
(10.12)
</p>
<p>and then rewrite the equation of motion as

</p>

</p>
<p>With � D 0 this would be Newtonian gravity and the solution would be an ellipse.
For Mercury, � is very small and so we can look for a solution that is perturbed away
from an ellipse. The solution has the form [12]

<p>Notice the second term. In order for cosŒ�.1 � �/&#141; to complete a full cycle, � has
to range from 0 to 2�=.1 � �/ � 2�.1C �/. Therefore it takes an extra azimuthal
angle&#129;� � 2�� for the planet to return to perihelion.
</p>
<p>How strong is the effect? Using Eq. (3.11) we can rewrite ` in terms of orbital
elements and obtain

<p>The precession is an angle of about 2�� per orbit, so given Mercury&rsquo;s orbital period

</p>
<p>This was the first good explanation for Mercury&rsquo;s perihelion shift, and it convinced
Einstein that he was on the right track with his new theory of gravity.
</p>
<p>10.4.2 Bending of Light (1919)
</p>
<p>We have already discussed Einstein&rsquo;s prediction for the bending of light by the Sun,
and the measurements in 1919 and 1922 that confirmed the prediction. This was the
second significant test of general relativity, and the first true prediction. (Einstein&rsquo;s
explanation of Mercury&rsquo;s perihelion shift was &ldquo;merely&rdquo; an explanation of existing
data.)
</p>
<p>10.4.3 Gravitational Redshift on Earth (1960)
</p>
<p>In Sect. 10.3.4 we discussed gravitational time dilation on the surface of Earth.
While the effect is small, it turns out that we can measure the corresponding
gravitational redshift. Atomic nuclei have energy levels just like atomic electrons,
so they can produce emission or absorption lines in energy spectra. The difference
is that nuclear lines generally involve much higher energies and are very narrow.
For example, iron-57 has a spectral line with energy E D 14:4 keV and line
width ıE � 10�11 keV. Because the line is so narrow, we can measure energies or
frequencies very precisely. In 1959 and 1960, Pound and Rebka [13, 14] realized</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>194 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>they could use this to measure gravitational redshift. They wanted of course to
have light traverse as much vertical distance as possible; in the physics department
at Harvard, the best option was a height of h D 22:6m in the stairwell. From
Eq. (10.10) with g D GM=r2, the fractional change in frequency as the light travels
upward is

<p>It seems astounding that we can measure relativistic effects to a few parts in 1015.
More recent experiments are even more precise.
</p>
<p>10.4.4 Gravitational Redshift from a White Dwarf (1971)
</p>
<p>The gravitational redshift on Earth is small because Earth&rsquo;s gravity is weak. Even
on the Sun the effect is small:&#129;�=� D �2�10�6 between the surface and a point at
infinity. To get a larger shift we need an object that is massive but compact. A white
dwarf star is typically about as massive as the Sun but only as large as Earth (see
Sect. 17.2). The nearest white dwarf is Sirius B, so named because it is in a binary
with the bright star Sirius. In 1971, Greenstein et al. [15] managed to measure the
gravitational redshift of light from Sirius B. (See Hetherington [16] for more about
the history.) Greenstein et al. analyzed the spectrum of Sirius B to infer that the star
has a radius of

<p>In October 1971, Joseph Hafele and Richard Keating [6, 7] flew atomic clocks on
airplanes around the Earth. Airborne clocks experience time dilation (relative to
surface clocks) for two reasons: motion, because airplanes move at different speeds
than the surface of Earth; and gravity, because gravity is a little weaker at the
altitudes where planes fly.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the motion first. Both the airplane and the surface of Earth follow
curved trajectories, so strictly speaking they are not inertial reference frames, but we
will still use the special relativistic expression (10.5) to estimate the time dilation
due to motion. We will, however, reference our measurements to the center of Earth
so we can treat the surface and airplane on equal footing. Earth&rsquo;s rotation causes a
clock at the equator to have a speed relative to the center of Earth of

<p>Suppose the airplane is flying east/west with speed vA relative to Earth&rsquo;s center; then
write
</p>
<p>vA D vS C u
</p>
<p>so u is the speed of the airplane relative to Earth&rsquo;s surface. Relative to Earth&rsquo;s center,
the surface and airplane have relativistic factors

<p>10.4 Applications of General Relativity 197
</p>
<p>Note that the time dilation due to motion depends on the direction in which the
airborne clock flies. This is an important part of the relativistic prediction.
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider the effect of gravity. Using Eq. (10.11) but making a Taylor
series expansion, we can write the gravitational time dilation as
</p>
<p>t.r C h/
t.r/
</p>
<p>D t.r C h/=t1
t.r/=t1
</p>
<p>� 1 �GM=c

</p>
<p>GM
</p>
<p>c2r
� 1C GMh
</p>
<p>c2r.r C h/
</p>
<p>To this point we have only assumed that r and rCh are large comparedwithGM=c2.
For this experiment we can do an additional Taylor series expansion with h� r :
</p>
<p>t.r C h/
t.r/
</p>
<p>� 1C GMh
c2r2
</p>
<p>Then we identify t.r/ D t 0S with the surface and t.r Ch/ D t 0A with the airplane, so
we can write the time dilation induced by gravity as
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>t 0A � t 0S

</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>gravity

</p>
<p>The Concorde flew at an altitude of about 20 km, so the gravitational time shift is

</p>
<p>t 0A � t 0S
t 0S
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>gravity
</p>
<p>� 2:2 � 10�12 � C190 ns/day
</p>
<p>This is the same for airplanes moving both east and west.
We have considered an idealized experiment (daylong Concorde flights over the
</p>
<p>equator) that captures the main ideas, but Hafele and Keating analyzed the actual
flight paths. They found the following time shifts (measured in nanoseconds):
</p>
<p>Motion Gravity Net prediction Measurement
</p>
<p>Eastbound �184˙ 18 144˙ 14 �40˙ 23 �59˙ 10
Westbound 96˙ 10 179˙ 18 275˙ 21 273˙ 7
</p>
<p>(The uncertainties in the predictions include uncertainties in the flight parameters.)
Notice that the east- and westbound flights havemotion shifts with different signs, as
we discussed. Also, they have different gravity shifts, presumably because the flights
had different altitudes and/or durations. The key result is that the measurements
confirm the predictions; relativistic time dilation can be measured in a controlled
experiment.</p>

<p>10.4.6 Global Positioning System (1989)
</p>
<p>Since 1989 we have had a widespread example of flying clocks: the Global
Positioning System. GPS receivers take the time received from a satellite, compare
it with the time on Earth, and use the difference (along with the known speed of
light) to determine the distance to the satellite. Measuring distances to multiple
satellites makes it possible to triangulate a position on Earth to high precision. The
entire system rests on careful coordination between satellite and surface clocks, but
relativity says they tick at different rates. Relativistic effects must therefore be taken
into account for GPS to work. Let&rsquo;s estimate the size of those effects (see [17] for a
more detailed discussion).
</p>
<p>Each GPS satellite orbits about h D 20;000 km D 2 � 107m above the surface
of Earth. Its orbital speed is therefore
</p>
<p>v D
�

<p>GM
</p>
<p>r C h
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>D 3:9 � 103ms�1
</p>
<p>Each GPS satellite is moving faster than the surface of the Earth, so there is time
dilation due to motion6:
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>t 0A � t 0S
t 0S

2c2
</p>
<p>� �8:3 � 10�11 � �7:2 �s/day
</p>
<p>where we again use vS D 464m/s as the velocity of the surface of Earth. There is
also time dilation due to gravity (note that we no longer have h� r):
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>t 0A � t 0S
t 0S
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>gravity
</p>
<p>� GMh
c2r.r C h/ � 5:3 � 10
</p>
<p>�10 � 45:6 �s/day
</p>
<p>The net effect is that GPS satellites gain about 38�s per day relative to clocks on
the ground. If this difference were not taken into account, the time it takes the signal
to travel from the satellite would be calculated incorrectly, so the distance to the
satellite would be wrong, and the triangulation would be thrown off. How badly?
After 1 day the time error would be&#129;t D 38 �s, which would translate into an error
in the distance to each satellite of &#129;` D c &#129;t D 11 km. This is not precisely the
same as the error that a GPS receiver would make when triangulating from multiple
satellites, but it does give a sense of the magnitude of the effect.
</p>
<p>GPS is successful because the engineerswho designed the system used the antici-
pated orbits to build clocks that would compensate for most of the relativistic effects.
Also, each GPS receiver has a computer that performs relativistic calculations to
determine additional corrections. Impressive, eh? General relativity at work!
</p>
<p>6For comparison with Sect. 10.4.5, we retain the subscripts &ldquo;A&rdquo; for airplane and &ldquo;S&rdquo; for surface,
respectively, even though the airplane is now a satellite.</p>

</p>
<p>10.5 Mathematics of Relativity
</p>
<p>Now we turn to the mathematical framework of relativity. While we will not delve
into all of the details, we want to get to the point where we can analyze motion
around a black hole.7
</p>
<p>10.5.1 Spacetime Interval
</p>
<p>Fundamentally, relativity is about the geometry of spacetime. How do we quantify
geometry? The first step is to measure the distance between points. In familiar
Euclidean geometry, if we have two points
</p>
<p>.x; y; z/ and .x C dx; y C dy; z C dz/
</p>
<p>then we define
</p>
<p>d`2 D dx2 C dy2 C dz2
</p>
<p>and say that d` is the distance between the two points. If we have a curve, we
imagine breaking it into a series of small segments, computing d` for each segment,
and adding them up (by integrating).
</p>
<p>The distance d` is the same in all coordinate systems&mdash;it is invariant. We can
rotate or translate the coordinate system any way we like and still get the same
distance between the points.
</p>
<p>In the spacetime of special relativity, we add time to the mix by defining
</p>
<p>ds2 D c2 dt2 � .dx2 C dy2 C dz2/ (10.14)
</p>
<p>This is the &ldquo;distance&rdquo; between two points in spacetime, which we call the spacetime
interval. The expression for ds2 is known as the metric because it specifies how
we &ldquo;measure&rdquo; intervals. Notice that space and time both enter the metric but with
different signs. A key property of the spacetime interval is that it is invariant under
the Lorentz transformation, so it is a good tool for characterizing the geometry of
spacetime in special relativity.
</p>
<p>In Euclidean geometry d`2 is non-negative. In special relativity, by contrast, ds2
</p>
<p>can be positive, negative, or zero.8 As we will see below, a light ray has ds2 D 0;
</p>
<p>7Many books do give more details; A First Course in General Relativity by Bernard Schutz [2] is
a good example.
8It is tempting to think that ds is a real-valued quantity such that ds2 must be non-negative. In
relativity, ds2 is the quantity we work with, and it can be positive, zero, or negative. We may writep
ds2 (see below), but we do not write ds by itself.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>200 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>we call this a lightlike interval. For a clock sitting at a fixed position, the spacetime
interval between any two ticks has ds2 D c2 d�2 where � is the proper time;
therefore we say that any positive spacetime interval is timelike. Conversely, for a
ruler the spacetime interval between the two ends at any given time has ds2 D �dL2
where L is the proper length; therefore we say that any negative spacetime interval
is spacelike. To summarize:
</p>
<p>ds2 D

<p>ˆ

</p>
<p>c2 d�2 &gt; 0 timelike
</p>
<p>0 lightlike
</p>
<p>�dL2 &lt; 0 spacelike
(10.15)
</p>
<p>So far we have worked in Cartesian coordinates. Since many astrophysical
objects are (approximately) spherical, it is good to be able to work in spherical
coordinates .r; �; �/ as well. In Euclidean geometry, the distance between nearby
points in spherical coordinates can be written as
</p>
<p>d`2 D dr2 C r2 d�2 C r2 sin2 � d�2
</p>
<p>The extension to the spacetime interval of special relativity just adds time:
</p>
<p>ds2 D c2 dt2 � .dr2 C r2 d�2 C r2 sin2 � d�2/ (10.16)
</p>
<p>We will see variants of the spatial piece several times in this chapter and the next.
</p>
<p>Example: Straight Line
</p>
<p>To help understand the spacetime interval, consider a light ray moving in a straight
line. Suppose it moves along a line parallel to the x-axis but offset in the z-direction
by an amount b. The Cartesian spacetime coordinates can be written
</p>
<p>.t; x; y; z/ D .t; ct; 0; b/
</p>
<p>The spacetime interval for the light ray is the
</p>
<p>ds2 D c2 dt2 � c2 dt2 D 0
</p>
<p>This is a lightlike interval, as it should be.
Now consider spherical coordinates. Converting from .t; x; y; z/ to .t; r; �; �/
</p>
<p>yields
</p>
<p>r D
�
</p>
<p>b2 C c2t2

.b2 C c2t2/1=2 c dt d� D
</p>
<p>b
</p>
<p>b2 C c2t2 c dt d� D 0
</p>
<p>The spacetime interval in spherical coordinates is then
</p>
<p>ds2 D c2 dt2 � dr2 � r2 d�2
</p>
<p>D c2 dt2 � c

</p>

</p>
<p>While spherical coordinates are less natural for this problem than Cartesian
coordinates, they yield the same result. They will be more natural when we study
black holes.
</p>
<p>10.5.2 4-Vectors
</p>
<p>We need to introduce vectors describing motion in four-dimensional spacetime. Let
</p>
<p>X D .ct; x/ (10.17)
</p>
<p>be a 4-d position vector that includes the time coordinate (with a factor of c so
all components have dimensions of length). To compute the spacetime interval, we
need to introduce a tensor that characterizes the metric. In special relativity, the
tensor has the form
</p>
<p>g D
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>1 0 0 0
</p>
<p>0 �1 0 0
0 0 �1 0
0 0 0 �1
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>(10.18)
</p>
<p>Then we can write the spacetime interval as
</p>
<p>ds2 D
4
X
</p>
<p>�;�D1
g�� dX� dX�
</p>
<p>More generally, we use the tensor to define the dot product of any two 4-vectors:
</p>
<p>U � V D
X
</p>
<p>�;�
</p>
<p>g�� U� V� (10.19)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>202 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>Given X, we can define the associated 4-velocity to be
</p>
<p>V D dX
d�
</p>
<p>(10.20)
</p>
<p>Since this is defined using proper time, the spatial part of V is not the same as the
measured velocity v D dx=dt . In a frame where the particle moves with measured
velocity v, time dilation says the measured time is9
</p>
<p>t D &#13;v� where &#13;v D
�
</p>
<p>1 � jvj
2
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>��1=2
(10.21)
</p>
<p>Therefore the 4-velocity can be written in terms of the measured velocity as
</p>
<p>V D .&#13;vc; &#13;vv/ (10.22)
</p>
<p>Why do we define 4-velocity in this way? We know that X transforms by the
Lorentz transformation; then since � is invariant, we realize that V must follow
the Lorentz transformation as well. This clarifies the relation between reference
frames10:
</p>
<p>Vt D &#13;u V 0t C &#13;u ˇu V 0x (10.23a)
Vx D &#13;u V 0x C &#13;u ˇu V 0t (10.23b)
Vy D V 0y (10.23c)
</p>
<p>Vz D V 0z (10.23d)
</p>
<p>Our definition does mean that it takes a few extra steps to relate the measured
velocities in different frames. In the primed frame, we can use Eq. (10.22) to write
the 4-velocity in terms of the components of the measured velocity:
</p>
<p>V0 D
fc; v0x ; v0y ; v0zg
Œ1 � .v0/2=c2&#141;1=2
</p>
<p>We can then use Eq. (10.23) to find the 4-velocity in the unprimed frame:
</p>
<p>V D
f&#13;u.c C ˇuv0x/; &#13;u.v0x C ˇuc/; v0y ; v0zg
</p>
<p>Œ1 � .v0/2=c2&#141;1=2
</p>
<p>9We put a subscript v on this &#13; to indicate that it is defined in terms of the particle&rsquo;s velocity and is
not necessarily the same as the &#13; factor between arbitrary inertial frames (defined in Eq. 10.2).
10We put a subscript u on &#13; and ˇ here to distinguish these factors, which relate arbitrary inertial
frames, from &#13;v in Eq. (10.21), which relates an arbitrary inertial frame to the particle&rsquo;s rest frame.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.5 Mathematics of Relativity 203
</p>
<p>Inverting the relation between v and the spatial components of V gives
</p>
<p>fvx; vy ; vzg D
fVx ; Vy ; Vzg
</p>
<p>Œ1C .V 2x C V 2y C V 2z /=c2&#141;1=2
</p>
<p>Plugging in and simplifying yields

<p>vz D
v0z
</p>
<p>&#13;u.1C uv0x=c2/
</p>
<p>This is the same transformation we found by a different approach in Eq. (10.4).
</p>
<p>10.5.3 Relativistic Momentum and Energy
</p>
<p>We also need to generalize the concepts of energy and momentum. We define the
4-momentum to be
</p>
<p>P D mV D .&#13;vmc; &#13;vmv/ (10.24)
</p>
<p>We then take the relativistic versions of energy and momentum to be the time and
space parts of P, respectively:
</p>
<p>P D
�
</p>
<p>E
</p>
<p>c
;p
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>(10.25)
</p>
<p>(The factor of c is included so E has dimensions of energy.) To understand what E
represents, consider the dot product of P with itself. Using Eq. (10.24) along with
the definition of the dot product in Eq. (10.19), we have
</p>
<p>P � P D &#13;2vm2c2 � &#13;2vm2v2 D &#13;2v
�
</p>
<p>1 � v
2
</p>
<p>c2
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>m2c2 D m2c2
</p>
<p>where we use Eq. (10.21) to simplify. If instead we computed the dot product using
Eq. (10.25), we would find
</p>
<p>P � P D
�
</p>
<p>E
</p>
<p>c
</p>
<p>�2
</p>
<p>� p2</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>204 10 Relativity
</p>
<p>In other words, the relativistic energy and momentum are related by
�
</p>
<p>E
</p>
<p>c
</p>
<p>�2
</p>
<p>� p2 D m2c2 ) E2 D p2c2 Cm2c4 (10.26)
</p>
<p>In the particle&rsquo;s rest frame, p D 0 so we recover the famous relation E D mc2 for
the rest mass energy. In the non-relativistic limit, p � mc so we can make a Taylor
series expansion:
</p>
<p>E D mc2
�
</p>
<p>1C p
2
</p>
<p>m2c2
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>� mc2 C p
2
</p>
<p>2m
</p>
<p>The first term is the rest-mass energy,while the second term is the Newtonian kinetic
energy. The bottom line is that we can interpret E as the total energy in relativity.
</p>
<p>There is one more useful relation we can derive. Again combining Eqs. (10.24)
and (10.25), we can write
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>E
D v
c2
</p>
<p>Using Eq. (10.26) to rewrite E yields
</p>
<p>v D pc
2
</p>
<p>.p2c2 Cm2c4/1=2 (10.27)
</p>
<p>This is the relativistic version of the relation between momentum and velocity. In
the non-relativistic limit, p � mc so Eq. (10.27) reduces to the familiar relation
v � p=m.
</p>
<p>10.6 Black Holes
</p>
<p>To this point we have discussed situations in which gravity is &ldquo;weak&rdquo; and we can
make Taylor series expansions. We now move into the regime of &ldquo;strong&rdquo; gravity
and examine a surprising and bizarre prediction of general relativity: black holes.
While we are particularly interested in the strange physics near a black hole&rsquo;s event
horizon, our analysis actually applies outside any spherical object in GR.

<p>To begin, we need to specify the spacetime geometry through the metric. To
understand the form of the metric, recall from Eq. (10.11) the expression for
gravitational time dilation,</p>

<p>Presumably this factor appears in the time term of the metric. It also appears in
the space term (basically from the curvature we discussed in Sect. 10.3.3). The full
metric outside any spherical object of massM is

</p>
<p>This is called the Schwarzschild metric after the German mathematician Karl
Schwarzschild, who discovered it as a solution of the equations of Einstein&rsquo;s general
theory of relativity.11
</p>
<p>We think of the coordinates .t; r; �; �/ as quantities that would be measured by an
observer far from the object, and we refer to them as &ldquo;coordinate time,&rdquo; &ldquo;coordinate
radius,&rdquo; etc. They are different from quantities measured by an observer near the
object; understanding the difference is one of our goals.
</p>
<p>Notice that something funny happens to the metric when r approaches the
Schwarzschild radius RS D 2GM=c2: the time term vanishes, while the radial
term diverges. In the early twentieth century, all known astrophysical objects had
sizes R � RS , so Einstein and other prominent figures such as Arthur Eddington
assumed the weirdness was merely a mathematical curiosity, not a physical reality.
It was only later, after Subramanyan Chandrasekhar and Robert Oppenheimer
showed that stars could collapse to become comparable to or even smaller than the
Schwarzschild radius, that physicists began to take the strange predictions seriously.
</p>
<p>The Schwarzschild metric deviates from the flat spacetime from special relativity
(Eq. 10.16) only to the extent thatRS=r is nonzero. This allows us, finally, to specify
what we mean by &ldquo;weak&rdquo; or &ldquo;strong&rdquo; gravity:
</p>
<p>r � RS !

</p>
<p>r
� 1 ! &ldquo;weak field&rdquo;
</p>
<p>r � RS !

</p>
<p>r
� 1 ! &ldquo;strong field&rdquo;
</p>
<p>11Historical aside (drawn from Black Holes and Time Warps by Kip Thorne [18]): When Einstein&rsquo;s
general theory of relativity was published on Nov. 25, 1915, Schwarzschild was serving in the
German army on the Russian front in the first World War. He managed to obtain Einstein&rsquo;s paper,
read it, apply it to stars, discover a solution to the complicated equations Einstein had derived,
write a paper of his own, and send it to Einstein&mdash;all in time for Einstein to present the paper on
Schwarzschild&rsquo;s behalf at a meeting on Jan. 13, 1916. Unfortunately, Schwarzschild died on May
11 of illness contracted during his service.</p>

<p>To give some examples, let&rsquo;s quantify the Schwarzschild radius:

</p>
<p>10.6.2 Spacetime Geometry
</p>
<p>To begin to see some of the weird properties of a black hole, consider the spacetime
interval between ticks on a stationary clock. If the clock does not move then dr D
d� D d� D 0, so the spacetime interval is
</p>
<p>ds2 D

<p>c2 dt2 D
(
</p>
<p>&gt; 0 (timelike) for r &gt; RS
</p>
<p>&lt; 0 (spacelike) for r &lt; RS
</p>
<p>The spacetime interval changes sign at the Schwarzschild radius, switching from
spacelike to timelike. This is important because no physical object can experience a
spacelike interval; to do so, it would have to move faster than the speed of light.
We seem to have a paradox: a stationary clock inside the Schwarzschild radius
would have a spacelike interval, which is not allowed. To resolve the paradox, we
conclude that it is impossible to remain stationary inside the Schwarzschild radius.
In fact, objects inside the Schwarzschild radius are inexorably drawn to the central
singularity, just as on Earth we are inexorably drawn forward in time.</p>

<p>10.6.3 Particle in a Circular Orbit
</p>
<p>As we set out to study motion in general relativity, it is good to start with the
simple case of circular orbits. Such an orbit stays in a plane, and we can choose
our coordinates so this is the equatorial plane:
</p>
<p>r D constant � D �
2
</p>
<p>� D ! t
</p>
<p>where ! is the coordinate angular speed. The period of the orbit in coordinate time
is P D 2�=!. The spacetime interval for the orbit is:
</p>

</p>

<p>c2 dt2
</p>
<p>With this we can determine the proper time (see Eq. 10.15):

<p>This is the time that would be measured on a clock that is executing the circular
orbit. Note that it is not a simple integral over dt ; we must account for the motion
using the spacetime interval.
</p>
<p>We have not yet specified the radius. We can find it by applying Fermat&rsquo;s
principle of least time: for a given angular speed, the particle will &ldquo;choose&rdquo; the
radius that minimizes the proper time. Operationally, we want to find the radius that
minimizes � , so we want to solve

<p>This is the same expression we had in Newtonian gravity (see Eq. 7.7). In other
words, a distant observer would measure the same orbital size and orbital velocity,
and hence the same orbital period, as in Newtonian gravity. But a clock following
the circular orbit would measure the proper time, which is different:

<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>P
</p>
<p>This is identical to the gravitational time dilation for a clock at rest in a gravitational
field that we examined in Sect. 10.3.4.
</p>
<p>We see that time is complicated! The time you measure depends on where you
are and how you are moving. These are both effects that we have seen already
(time dilation in special and general relativity), but it is interesting to see how they
manifest themselves here.
</p>
<p>Example: Circular Orbit Around Sgr A�
</p>
<p>Imagine we were in a spaceship orbiting the black hole at the center of the Milky
Way at r D 3RS . If we take Mbh D 4 � 106Mˇ then from Eq. (10.29) the
Schwarzschild radius is RS D 1:18 � 1010m, and so the radius of the orbit is
r D 3RS D 3:54 � 1010m. The orbital period as measured by a distant observer
(i.e., in coordinate time) is the same as in Newtonian gravity:
</p>
<p>P D 2�

<p>D 2�
�
</p>
<p>r3
</p>
<p>GM
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>D 1;800 s D 30min
</p>
<p>However, our clocks on the spaceship show the proper time, and in our frame one
orbital period takes
</p>
<p>�circ D
�
</p>
<p>1 � 3RS
2r
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>P D 1;290 s D 21min
</p>
<p>If we had friends in a space station that is sitting at a fixed spot with r D 3RS (i.e.,
not orbiting but stationary), they would measure our orbital period as
</p>
<p>�rest D
�
</p>
<p>1 � RS
r
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>P D 1;490 s D 25min
</p>
<p>Again, time depends on where you are and how you are moving.</p>

<p>10.6.4 General Motion Around a Black Hole

<p>Now we allow general motion.12 Let&rsquo;s briefly review the Newtonian case as a point

to a plane, which we can define to be the equatorial plane. The equation of motion

<p>The first term is the familiar Newtonian gravitational potential. The second term is
the centrifugal term. The last term is just a constant that we add because it will prove
to be convenient in the relativistic case.
</p>
<p>The effective potential is useful because we can think of it as a surface and use our
intuition to understand what would happen to a ball on that surface. Some examples
are shown by the dashed curves in Fig. 10.3. For ` D 0 the ball would roll all the
way down to r D 0. For any nonzero value of `, however, the centrifugal term
causes an upturn at small radius. This creates a stationary point that corresponds to
a constant radius and hence a circular orbit. In the Newtonian effective potential, the

<p>In general relativity the equation of motion can be written in the form of (10.31)
but with a different effective potential. To find that potential, recall that special
relativity has a relation between energy, momentum, and mass: .E=c/2 � p2 D m2
(Eq. 10.26). With the Schwarzschild metric the analogous relation has factors of

we cannot define the energy and angular momentum per unit mass. Nevertheless,
light does carry both energy and momentum, and we can keep the same form of

Sample GR potentials are shown by the solid curves in Fig. 10.3. There are
</p>
<p>several important points to make:
</p>
<p>&bull; At large radius, the new term GM`2=c2r3 from GR is small, so Newtonian
gravity is a good approximation. GR effects are significant only at small radii.
</p>
<p>&bull; For ` above some critical value `crit, there is a minimum in the potential curve,
which corresponds to a stable circular orbit. (You can find `crit, along with the
location of the stable circular orbit, in Problem 10.7.)
</p>
<p>&bull; For ` &gt; `crit, there is also a maximum in the GR potential curve. It corresponds
to a second allowed circular orbit for a given angular momentum, but one that is
unstable. This is new in GR.
</p>
<p>&bull; For ` &lt; `crit, there is no minimum in the potential curve, and hence no stable
circular orbit. Thus, there exists some smallest stable circular orbit in GR. This is
another new feature (Newtonian gravity allows arbitrarily small circular orbits).
</p>
<p>&bull; The GR potential turns over at small radius, so if a particle gets too close to the
black hole it cannot help but fall in. The ability to fall all the way to r D 0 with
finite angular momentum is yet another difference from Newtonian gravity.
</p>

<p>Fig. 10.4 The dashed and solid lines show how the coordinate time and proper time (respectively)
flow as an object falls into a black hole. The horizontal axis is radius scaled by the Schwarzschild
radius; the dotted line indicates the event horizon. The vertical axis is time scaled by RS=c. In this
example, time is defined to be 0 at r=RS D 10 even though the particle started from rest at infinity
</p>
<p>You can explore various aspects of motion in the Schwarzschild metric in
Problems 10.6 and 10.7. Here let&rsquo;s consider a particle falling from rest into a black
hole. We know the particle falls straight in, so one of the constants of motion is
` D 0. If the particle starts from rest (dr=d� D 0) at infinity, then QE D c2.
In Eq. (10.40) we choose the minus sign since we know radius must decrease with
time. We can then rewrite the equation of motion as
</p>
<p>c dt D �
�
</p>
<p>1 � RS
r
</p>
<p>��1 �
r
</p>
<p>RS
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>dr
</p>
<p>Integrating both sides yields t.r/ as shown in Fig. 10.4. The curious result is that
time goes to infinity as r approaches RS . As seen by an observer far away, the
particle never actually reaches the black hole!
</p>
<p>This bizarre result only applies to the coordinate time. Repeating the analysis
using the equation of motion (10.38) reveals that proper time&mdash;which is what you
would see on your watch if you fell into a black hole&mdash;is perfectly well behaved.
It is possible to fall into a black hole, but no one on the outside can see it.

<p>10.6.5 Gravitational Deflection
</p>
<p>We are now equipped to derive the relativistic deflection angle that we previously
quoted in Sect. 9.1.1.13 Consider the setup in Fig. 10.5, which is modified from
Fig. 9.1 to have the particle move from right to left so the azimuthal angle �

<p>10.7 Other Effects
</p>
<p>Many other aspects of relativity lie beyond the scope of this book, but two are
worth mentioning briefly. First, we have studied black holes that are static and
spherically symmetric, but most objects in the universe rotate. Roy Kerr [20] found
a solution to Einstein&rsquo;s equations that describes a rotating black hole. The spin
modifies spacetime in the vicinity of the black hole, which affects the motion of
any matter in an accretion disk and the properties of light emitted from the disk.
Observations of spectral lines from black hole accretion disks can therefore be used
to measure black hole spin and probe the Kerr metric (see [21] for a review).
</p>
<p>Second, relativity predicts that accelerating masses create ripples in spacetime
that propagate as gravitational waves. Gravitational radiation from accelerating
masses is somewhat analogous to electromagnetic radiation from accelerating
charges, although the analogy is not precise. The waves are predicted to carry
energy away from a binary star system and cause the stars&rsquo; orbits to decay. (You can
explore this process in Problem 10.8.) The energy loss scales with orbital separation
as P / a�5, so it mainly affects close binaries. Two particular systems show
clear evidence for orbital decay due to gravitational radiation: the &ldquo;binary pulsar&rdquo;
PSR B1913C16, discovered in 1974 by Hulse and Taylor [22] (for which they
received the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics); and the &ldquo;double pulsar&rdquo; J0737�3039,
discovered in 2003 by Burgay et al. [23]. These systems provide strong if indirect
tests of predictions for gravitational radiation [24, 25]. The next goal is to detect
gravitational waves directly. Projects such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-
Wave Observatory as well as Virgo, AURIGA, and MiniGRAIL are trying to create
newways for us to observe the effects of strong gravity in extreme events throughout
the universe.</p>

<p>Problems
</p>
<p>10.1. If the Sun were replaced by a black hole with the same mass, would Earth&rsquo;s
orbit change significantly? Why or why not?
</p>
<p>10.2. The Michelson-Morley experiment showed that the speed of light does not
depend on the speed of the source. Use the velocity transformation (10.4) to explain
the result. Specifically:
</p>
<p>(a) Suppose a source moving horizontally with speed u emits a light ray going in the
horizontal direction.What is the speed and direction of the light ray as measured
by a stationary observer?
</p>
<p>(b) Suppose a source moving horizontally with speed u emits a light ray going in
the vertical direction (in the source&rsquo;s reference frame). What is the speed and
direction of the light ray as measured by a stationary observer?
</p>
<p>10.3. Muons are elementary particles produced when cosmic rays collide with
atoms in Earth&rsquo;s upper atmosphere. Muons are unstable and decay, so the number of
muons as a function of time has the formN.t/ D N0 e�t=� where � D 2:20�10�6 s
and N0 is the number at t D 0. In 1963, Frisch and Smith [5] put a muon detector
at the top of Mt. Washington (1,907m above sea level) and counted 563 muons
per hour coming down through the atmosphere. Then they took their detector to
sea level and counted 408 muons per hour. From the muon energies they inferred a
speed of 0:995 c.
</p>
<p>(a) If there were no time dilation, how many muons should have been measured at
sea level?
</p>
<p>(b) How does time dilation affect the experiment?
(c) Use the experimental data to determine the muons&rsquo; relativistic &#13; factor.
</p>
<p>10.4. Let&rsquo;s see how light from the Hˇ transition of hydrogen (wavelength
486:13 nm) is affected by the relativistic Doppler effect and time dilation.
</p>
<p>(a) Consider debris from a supernova moving directly toward an observer on Earth
with a speed v D 18;000 kms�1. At what wavelength would the Hˇ spectral
line from the debris be observed?
</p>
<p>(b) Imagine instead the debris is moving perpendicular to our line of sight (i.e., &ldquo;in
the plane of the sky&rdquo;) with a transverse velocity v D 18;000 kms�1. Now at
what wavelength would the Hˇ line be observed? Hint: you can consider the
light to be a &ldquo;clock&rdquo; with a frequency �.
</p>
<p>(c) What would the predicted wavelengths have been for parts (a) and (b) if we had
ignored special relativity and used the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; Doppler formula &#129;�=� D
vradial=c?
</p>
<p>10.5. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938MeV. The Large Hadron
Collider is designed to accelerate protons to an energy of about 7TeV. How fast
do such protons move? Hint: write v D .1 � ı/c and find ı.</p>

<p>10.6. Suppose a probe that emits a flash of green light (� D 500 nm) once every
second is dropped into the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, starting at rest
from r D 2RS . UseM D 4 � 106Mˇ (see Sect. 3.2.1).
(a) In the probe&rsquo;s reference frame, howmuch time elapses as it falls from its starting

<p>point to the event horizon? From the event horizon to the center? Hint: by
changing variables, you can express the integral in a form that can be evaluated
using Sect. A.7.
</p>
<p>(b) Describe qualitatively what you would see from a fixed vantage point far from
the black hole as the probe falls in.
</p>
<p>(c) What is the wavelength of the first flash, as measured by a distant observer?
What about the last flash emitted by the probe before it crosses the event
horizon? Hint: you will need to use a numerical root finder to solve for radius
corresponding to the last integer second before the probe crosses the event
horizon.
</p>
<p>10.7. For a particle moving in the Schwarzschild metric, the effective potential is
given by Eq. (10.37). Consider a circular orbit.
</p>
<p>(a) For a massive particle ( Qm D 1), there are two possible circular orbits. What are
their radii? What is the smallest value of ` for which the answer is physical?
What is the radius of the smallest possible circular orbit?
</p>
<p>(b) For a photon ( Qm D 0), show that it is possible to have a circular orbit at a
particular radius, but the orbit is unstable.
</p>
<p>10.8. In a binary star system, the accelerating masses create gravitational radiation
that removes energy from the system. For stars of massM1 andM2 in nearly circular
orbits separated by distance a, the power emitted in gravitational radiation is [26]

<p>(c) The binary pulsar system J0737�3039 has an orbital period of P D 0:102 day,
and the stars move in nearly circular orbits with speeds of about 310 kms�1.
When will the stars merge? (Assume the stars have the same mass. Problem 4.5
gives more precise parameters, but we use simpler approximations here.)</p>

<p>Cosmology: Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>Beyond describing the spacetime around a black hole, general relativity provides a
framework for studying the universe as a whole. Some of the great discoveries in
cosmology during the twentieth century related to the expansion of the universe.
In this chapter we study cosmic expansion in the context of relativistic cosmology.
Later, in Chap. 20, we will examine how particles and gas behaved within the
expanding universe shortly after the Big Bang.
</p>
<p>11.1 Hubble&rsquo;s Law and the Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century, Vesto Slipher [1], WilliamWallace Campbell [2], and
others measured spectra of &ldquo;nebulae&rdquo; (these objects were not yet known to be other
galaxies) and used the Doppler effect to infer that most of them are moving away
from us. For nearby galaxies, whose recession speeds are small compared with the
speed of light, we can use the non-relativistic limit of the Doppler formula (10.8) to
write the redshift as
</p>
<p>z � &#129;�
�rest
</p>
<p>� v
c
</p>
<p>In 1929, Edwin Hubble [3] discovered a linear correlation between a galaxy&rsquo;s reces-
sion speed, v, and its distance from us, d , which is now known as Hubble&rsquo;s law:
</p>
<p>v D H0 d (11.1)
</p>
<p>where the proportionality factor H0 is called the Hubble constant. As we will see,
we now understand that the original relation is limited in two ways: the Hubble
&ldquo;constant&rdquo; actually varies with time, and the linear relation holds only for galaxies
that are &ldquo;nearby&rdquo; on cosmic scales (within a few hundred Mpc). Hubble&rsquo;s discovery

<p>222 11 Cosmology: Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>nevertheless played a key role in revealing the expansion of the universe. Assuming
that we are not in a special place in the universe (see Sect. 11.2.1), Hubble&rsquo;s law
implies that galaxies are receding not only from us but also from each other; all
galaxies are moving apart as the universe itself expands.
</p>
<p>After many decades of effort (and dispute), we now have a good value for the
Hubble constant [4, 5],
</p>
<p>H0 D 73:8˙ 2:4 km s�1Mpc�1 (11.2)
</p>
<p>The controversy is not entirely gone; a recent analysis of the Cosmic Microwave
Background from the Planck spacecraft (see Sect. 20.1.3) yielded a value H0 D
67:3˙1:2 kms�1Mpc�1 [6] that is formally inconsistent with Eq. (11.2). The Planck
analysis involved certain assumptions that remain to be verified, so I prefer to
adopt the value in Eq. (11.2) that comes more directly from measurements of
expansion. The dimensions of the Hubble constant are inverse time, but using
units of km s�1Mpc�1 gives us the convenience of expressing distances in Mpc
and velocities in km s�1. For example, Eqs. (11.1) and (11.2) together indicate
that a galaxy 100Mpc away will have a cosmological recession velocity of about
7;380 kms�1.
</p>
<p>If the universe is expanding and all galaxies are moving apart, we can imagine
reversing time and watching them come together at some moment in the past:
the Big Bang. If the expansion occurred at a uniform rate, the age of the universe
(the time since the Big Bang) would be t0 D H�10 . In fact, the expansion rate has not
been constant, but the quantity H�10 still sets the basic time scale for the universe,
so it is known as the Hubble time:

<p>11.2 Relativistic Cosmology
</p>
<p>Why is relativity important for cosmology? Recall from Sect. 10.6.1 that relativistic
effects become important when the ratio � D GM=c2R becomes comparable to
unity. In the case of black holes and other compact objects, � can approach 1 when
R is small. In the case of the universe, by contrast, � can be significant when R
is large. If the density of the universe is roughly uniform, a region of size R will
have massM / R3 and the &ldquo;relativity indicator&rdquo; will scale as � / R2. Even if � is
small on the scale of a planetary system or galaxy, it will become appreciable as we
consider larger and larger scales.</p>

<p>11.2 Relativistic Cosmology 223
</p>
<p>11.2.1 Robertson-Walker Metric
</p>
<p>The first step in any relativistic analysis is to specify the spacetime geometry.
It may seem daunting to describe the universe in its entirety, but certain symmetries
simplify the task. According to the cosmological principle, no place or direction
is special: the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. This is a working hypothesis,
not a proven result, and it is obviously wrong on small scales; we can make a
long list of ways in which the place we live differs from other places (on Earth,
in the Solar System, etc.). However, as we examine larger and larger volumes of the
universe, it does seem that everything begins to look the same [7].
</p>
<p>In order for the universe to be isotropic, the angular piece of the metric must have
the form r2 d�2Cr2 sin2 � d�2 that is familiar from the spherically-symmetric case.
In order for the universe to be homogeneous, the spatial curvature must be the same
everywhere. In the 1930s, Howard Percy Robertson [8] and Arthur GeoffreyWalker
[9] showed that the most general metric satisfying the cosmological principle has
the form
</p>
<p>ds2 D c2 dt2 � R.t/2
�
</p>
<p>dr2
</p>
<p>1 � kr2 C r
2 d�2 C r2 sin2 � d�2
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>(11.3)
</p>
<p>This is now known as the Robertson-Walker metric. The constant k describes the
spatial geometry:
</p>
<p>k
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>ˆ
</p>
<p>ˆ
</p>
<p>&lt;
</p>
<p>ˆ
</p>
<p>ˆ
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>&gt; 0 curved like a sphere (&ldquo;closed&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>D 0 flat
&lt; 0 curved like a saddle (&ldquo;open&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>While it may be difficult to picture curved 3-d space, we can think of 2-d analogs as
shown in Fig. 11.1. We describe the k &gt; 0 case as &ldquo;closed&rdquo; because it is possible to
walk in a &ldquo;straight&rdquo; line (i.e., always going in the same direction) and still return to
the starting point, tracing out a closed curve; another way to say this is that the area
of a k &gt; 0 surface is finite. By contrast, a k &lt; 0 surface is &ldquo;open&rdquo; in the sense
that &ldquo;straight&rdquo; lines do not close on themselves, and the area is infinite (unless the
surface has an edge). A k D 0 surface is also infinite, but it is special for being
geometrically flat.
</p>
<p>The factor R.t/ multiplying the spatial part of the metric is called the scale
factor. To understand why, consider for a moment a radial spoke in a flat universe
(k D 0). The proper distance between two points with radial coordinates r1 and r2 is
</p>
<p>L D
p
�ds2 D R.t/ jr2 � r1j</p>

For a matter-filled universe, the curvature is related to the density of the universe (represented here
by ˝0; see text) (Credit: NASA / WMAP Science Team)
</p>
<p>If R.t/ changes with time, the proper distance between the two points changes even
if they stay at the same coordinates. Heuristically, we say the &ldquo;size&rdquo; of the universe
changes with time. In what follows we take R.t/ to have dimensions of length,
making r a dimensionless radial coordinate.
</p>
<p>11.2.2 The Friedmann Equation
</p>
<p>In the Robertson-Walker metric, the expansion of the universe is described by the
way the scale factor changes with time. The proper way to derive an &ldquo;equation of
motion&rdquo; for R.t/ involves more details of relativity than I want to go into. Several
sources (e.g., [10, 11]) present a nice argument based on Newtonian gravity that,
while not precisely correct, captures the key physics and yields the right equation.
</p>
<p>Consider a sphere of radius R and density �, so the mass is M D .4=3/�R3�.
Place a small &ldquo;test&rdquo; mass m � M on the surface of the sphere. Now let the
sphere expand and suppose the test mass stays right on the surface. At any time
the gravitational potential energy of the test mass is

G �.t/ R.t/2 D �kc2 (11.4)
</p>
<p>This is called the Friedmann equation after Alexander Friedmann, who derived it
in 1922 [12]. (It was derived independently by Georges Lema&icirc;tre in 1927 [13].) In
general relativity, it is the equation of motion for a universe that is filled with matter
that exerts gravity but has effectively no pressure.
</p>
<p>It is customary to define some new quantities:
</p>
<p>expansion rate H.t/ D 1
R
</p>
<p>dR
</p>
<p>dt
(11.5a)
</p>
<p>critical density �crit D

<p>8�G
(11.5b)
</p>
<p>density parameter ˝ D �
�crit
</p>
<p>(11.5c)
</p>
<p>Defining the expansion rate in this way makes it scale free, so its dimension is
inverse time; we use the symbolH deliberately, because it turns out that the Hubble
constant H0 is just the value of H.t/ today. Defining a density parameter that is
dimensionless is not merely convenient but also enlightening if we use the right
normalization factor. We will interpret the density normalization �crit momentarily.
Using these quantities, we can rewrite the Friedmann equation as
</p>

</p>
<p>This equation reveals that the density of the universe is related to its geometry:
</p>
<p>˝ &gt; 1$ k &gt; 0 &ldquo;closed&rdquo;
˝ D 1$ k D 0 &ldquo;flat&rdquo;
˝ &lt; 1$ k &lt; 0 &ldquo;open&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The transition corresponds to ˝ D 1, or � D �crit. Now we understand that �crit is
the &ldquo;critical&rdquo; density that makes the universe flat. A density higher than the critical
value causes the universe to be closed, while a density lower than the critical value
makes the universe open.
</p>
<p>As written in Eq. (11.4), the Friedmann equation involves what is effectively the
velocity of expansion (dR=dt). We can also obtain an equation for the effective
acceleration. As the universe expands, conservation of mass implies
</p>
<p>�0R

</p>
<p>This acceleration equation is another key component of relativistic cosmology.
Since � and R are always positive, the right-hand side is always negative. This
means a universe filled with matter that exerts gravity but no pressure is always
decelerating (and so the equation might be better termed the &ldquo;deceleration
equation&rdquo;). No static solution is allowed; such a universe must be dynamic.
</p>
<p>The Friedmann equation can be solved for the model discussed here (see
Problem 11.5) to obtain the curves shown in Fig. 11.2. An interesting conceptual
point is that for ˝ � 1 the universe expands forever, while for ˝ &gt; 1 the universe
expands only to some finite maximum size before turning around and collapsing
(see Problem 11.4). For a universe filled with pressure-less matter, the density of the
universe determines its destiny.</p>

</p>
<p>11.2.3 Einstein&rsquo;s Greatest Blunder
</p>
<p>Einstein discovered in 1917 that his equations did not naturally permit a static
universe. He did not believe the universe is dynamic, though, so he modified the
equations. He introduced a new term so the Friedmann equation would become
</p>
<p>�
</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>R2 D �kc2 (11.7)

<p>and the corresponding acceleration equation would be

</p>
<p>dt2
D
�
</p>
<p>�4� G �C�c2
� R
</p>
<p>3
(11.8)
</p>
<p>Here� is a new constant that is now known as the cosmological constant. With the
modification, Einstein was able to find a model of the universe that was static: the
two equations admit a solution with dR=dt D 0 and d2R=dt2 D 0 if
</p>
<p>� D kc
2
</p>
<p>4�GR2
and � D k
</p>
<p>R2
(static)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>228 11 Cosmology: Expanding Universe
</p>
<p>In other words, the universe can be static&mdash;but only if it has certain values of the
matter density, the cosmological constant, and the scale factor. If � &gt; 0 then k &gt; 0
as well, so the universe must have positive curvature.
</p>
<p>After Edwin Hubble discovered the expansion of the universe in 1929, Einstein
dismissed � as his &ldquo;greatest blunder&rdquo;; he had missed an opportunity to predict a
dynamic universe. Despite this inauspicious beginning, the notion of a cosmological
constant has come to play a major role in modern cosmology. Over the decades,
theorists have explored the implications of �. One key concept is that if �
exceeds some value then d2R=dt2 can be positive: the expansion of the universe
can accelerate! This feature began to receive broad attention in 1998, when two
groups mapping the universe with supernovae announced observational evidence
for accelerated expansion (see Sect. 11.3.3). Their work ultimately led to the 2011
Nobel Prize in Physics.
</p>
<p>11.2.4 FRW Cosmology
</p>
<p>Combining the Robertson-Walker metric with the Friedmann equation for the scale
factor leads to what we call Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology.
Let&rsquo;s manipulate the Friedmann equation again to put it in a form used in research
today. First, define a dimensionless scale factor
</p>
<p>a D R
R0
</p>
<p>(11.9)
</p>
<p>where the subscript 0 again denotes the value today. At a general time, the
Friedmann equation can be written as

</p>
<p>where ˝k D 1 � ˝M � ˝� is defined to be the &ldquo;curvature density.&rdquo; Now we
understand that in a universewith both matter and�, the total density of the universe
is still related to its geometry:
</p>
<p>˝M C˝� &gt; 1$ &ldquo;closed&rdquo;
˝M C˝� D 1$ &ldquo;flat&rdquo;
˝M C˝� &lt; 1$ &ldquo;open&rdquo;
</p>
<p>However, the total density of the universe no longer uniquely determines its destiny,
because matter and � affect the expansion in different ways.
</p>
<p>11.3 Observational Cosmology
</p>
<p>With FRW theory in place, it would be lovely if we could measure R.t/ directly
and compare it with the curves in Fig. 11.2. Unfortunately, we cannot. What we
can measure is redshift as galaxies recede from us, and distance. In this section we
examine redshifts and distances in FRW cosmology, and then say a few words about
how we measure them and what the measurements have revealed.</p>

<p>The expansion of the universe carries galaxies away from us and therefore creates a

we use the minus sign and integrate from re to 0, but then we use the sign to switch

</p>
<p>R.te/

<p>If we are the observers then R.to/ is just the scale factor today, R0, and the ratio on
the right-hand side is the inverse of the dimensionless scale factor at the time the
light was emitted. Dropping the subscript &ldquo;e&rdquo; (since it is implicit that we discuss the
scale factor and redshift at the time the light was emitted), we have
</p>
<p>z D 1
a

<p>We see that cosmological redshift is directly related to the scale factor: as the
universe expands, a light ray gets stretched to longer wavelengths.

<p>11.3.2 Cosmological Distances
</p>
<p>We also want to discuss distance, but in a universe that is expanding and possibly
curved we need to take care to specify what we mean by the notion of &ldquo;distance.&rdquo;

Eq. (11.16), we can say that if light is emitted at .re; te/ and observed at .0; to/,
the coordinates are related by

<p>This is the general expression for the coordinate distance to redshift z. (We have
dropped the subscript on z for simplicity.) The factor of R0 appears on the left-hand
side because the coordinate radius always appears in the metric in combination with
the scale factor.
</p>
<p>Like the scale factor, coordinate distances cannot be measured directly. What,
then, can we measure? We can measure the apparent brightness of an object,
quantified in terms of the flux F defined to be the energy received per unit time
per unit area. The flux is related to the intrinsic luminosity L (energy emitted per
unit time) via the inverse square law,
</p>
<p>F D L
4�d 2L
</p>
<p>The distance that appears here is known as the luminosity distance (hence
the subscript &ldquo;L&rdquo; for &ldquo;luminosity&rdquo;). As light propagates through the universe, it
is subject to two effects. First, as we saw in Sect. 11.3.1, the time between photons
scales as .1 C z/, so the rate at which photons arrive scales as .1 C z/�1. Second,
the cosmological redshift increases the wavelength, which scales the photon energy
by .1C z/�1. These two factors mean the observed flux is related to the coordinate
distance as
</p>
<p>F D L
4�R20r
</p>
<p>2.1C z/2
</p>
<p>Thus, luminosity distance is related to coordinate distance as
</p>
<p>dL.z/ D .1C z/R0r.z/ (11.24)
</p>
<p>This, not R.t/, is the relation that is actually measurable (see below). Figure 11.3
shows dL.z/ curves for the FRW solutions that were shown in Fig. 11.2.
</p>
<p>We can also measure the angular size of an object. Consider an object with proper
length dL placed perpendicular to the line of sight such that the two ends have the
same azimuthal angle � but span a small range of polar angle, d� . We define the
angular diameter distance, dA, such that

</p>
<p>We can measure luminosity distances if we can observe a set of sources whose
luminosities are known. The simplest way to do this is to find standard candles,
or sources that all have the same intrinsic luminosity. In practice, few objects are
perfectly identical, but several classes of objects are &ldquo;standardizable&rdquo; in the sense
that their observable properties allow us to infer their intrinsic luminosities with</p>

<p>enough accuracy and precision to enable distance measurements. We will see in
Chap. 18 that this includes a class of variable stars called Cepheids and a class of
exploding stars called Type Ia supernovae.
</p>
<p>The latter objects revealed the accelerated expansion of the universe. In 1998, two
teams of astronomers [14, 15] reported that Type Ia supernovae at redshifts z &amp; 0:1
are farther away than expected for a universe in which matter has been causing
the expansion of the universe to decelerate (see Fig. 11.4). They concluded that the
universe contains some substance, dubbed dark energy, that causes the expansion
to accelerate. For now let us assume that dark energy is just the cosmological
constant, but we will briefly discuss other possibilities.
</p>
<p>While the evidence for accelerated expansion was strong, there was some
concern that a phenomenon other than dark energy might make distant supernovae
appear to be farther away than they actually are (e.g., supernovaewere less luminous
when the universe was younger, or some unusual kind of dust absorbs supernova
light without changing the color). A model with dark energy stands out from those
possibilities in an important way: in the past, the density of matter was higher than</p>

<p>Fig. 11.5 More supernova data, showing that the universe was decelerating at higher redshifts
(earlier times) before it switched to accelerating at lower redshifts (later times). That behavior
is expected for a model with both matter and dark energy. The top panel shows data points for
individual supernovae, while the bottom panel shows average values (Credit: Riess et al. [16].

</p>
<p>now (because the universe was smaller and mass is conserved), while the density of
� was the same (hence cosmological &ldquo;constant&rdquo;). Such a universe would shift from
deceleration at early times (when matter dominates) to acceleration at late times
(when � dominates). To test this prediction, astronomers searched for more distant
supernovae. Figure 11.5 shows that higher-redshift supernovae indeed reveal that
the universe was decelerating in the past before it switched to accelerating more
recently.
</p>
<p>The next step is to determine what values of ˝M and ˝� are consistent with
the data. Broadly speaking, the idea is to adjust these two parameters to make
the predicted dL.z/ curve pass through the data points. Figure 11.6 shows the
constraints from supernova data (in blue), together with constraints from two
other probes of the geometry of the universe: the cosmic microwave background
(in orange; see Chap. 20), and baryon acoustic oscillations (in green).1 Individually,
no probe uniquely determines both ˝M and ˝�. Supernovae, for example, permit
models with less mass and less � or more mass and more �, as long as the

<p>1The fluctuations we see in the cosmic microwave background were created by sound waves, or
acoustic oscillations, in the gas in the young universe. Those fluctuations left subtle imprints in the
structure of normal (&ldquo;baryonic&rdquo;) matter that are known as &ldquo;baryon acoustic oscillations.&rdquo; BAO can
be measured using the distribution of galaxies [18, 19].</p>

</p>
<p>combination yields a certain net acceleration. The three sets of constraints are
complementary, though, and together they determine ˝M and ˝� with small
uncertainties. The conclusion is that the universe is flat or very close to it, with
mass (mostly dark matter) contributing about 32% and � contributing about 68%
of the total energy density of the universe.
</p>
<p>The cosmological constant is weird: not only does it act as a kind of anti-gravity,
but as the universe expands the energy density associated with � stays constant.
Since the energy density associated with matter decreases (mass is constant as
volume increases), dark energy will dominate more and more over matter, and
the accelerated expansion will continue forever. In this scenario, everything outside
our Local Group of galaxies (which includes not only the Milky Way but also the
Andromeda galaxy and a few dozen small galaxies that orbit the two big ones) will
eventually have recession velocities so large that their light will never reach us. The
visible universe beyond the Local Group will eventually go dark (see Problem 11.7).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Problems 237
</p>
<p>That scenario assumes dark energy is Einstein&rsquo;s cosmological constant, which
is a simple assumption that is consistent with today&rsquo;s best data. However various
theoretical concerns about� have led many people to hypothesize that dark energy
could be more complicated and dynamic. We can characterize the repulsive effect
of dark energy by saying that it has a negative pressure and then relating the
pressure (P ) to the density (�) via an equation of state of the form P D w�c2.
The cosmological constant corresponds to w D �1, but other models of dark
energy have values of w that differ from �1 and maybe even vary with time.
In such scenarios, the ultimate fate of the universe is uncertain. In some models,
dark energy might be able to convert into matter or radiation and even lead to a
collapse and Big Crunch. Alternatively, if w &lt; �1 then the density of dark energy
will increase with time to the point that the expansion will ultimately overcome all
forces (not only gravity but also electromagnetism and nuclear forces) and tear apart
all galaxies, stars, planets, atoms, and even nuclei at some finite time in the future,
known as the Big Rip.
</p>
<p>Having said all that, we still need to ask: is dark energy even the correct model?
What if our assumptions about the cosmological principle are wrong, or general
relativity is not the correct theory of gravity? People are thinking seriously about
the possibility that Einstein&rsquo;s theory is an approximation to some more general
theory of gravity (similar to the way that Newton&rsquo;s theory is an approximation to
Einstein&rsquo;s) that can accommodate accelerated expansion without invoking an exotic
substance. We will not say more about that here, except to note that the issue of
dark energy versus modified gravity will ultimately be decided not by debate but
by data. More and better data, from supernovae, the cosmic microwave background,
and a wealth of other techniques, will provide the evidence we need to distinguish
between differentmodels for the structure, content, and eventual fate of the universe.

</p>
<p>11.2. Here is an alternate, and perhaps more intuitive, way to derive the critical
density of the universe.
</p>
<p>(a) Consider throwing a ball upward with speed v from the surface of a planet with
radius R. Show that if the planet&rsquo;s density exceeds some critical value, the ball
will go up, stop, and come back down, but if the density is lower than the critical
value, the ball will go up forever. Derive an expression for the critical density
of the planet in terms of v, R, and fundamental constants.
</p>
<p>(b) Now write v D HR in analog with the Hubble law, and show that your
expression is equivalent to the critical density of the universe.
</p>
<p>(c) Using the present-day value of the Hubble constant, compute the critical density
of the universe in g/cm3. How many protons per cubic meter is that?
</p>
<p>11.3. Show that the general expressions for cosmological distances reduce to
Hubble&rsquo;s law at low redshifts (z � 1). In this limit, the recession speed is v � cz.
11.4. For certain values of the cosmological density parameters, the expansion of
the universe can change direction. For each of the following scenarios, find the
value of a for the turnaround point, and indicate whether the universe changes from
expansion to contraction or vice versa. Explain your analysis.
</p>
<p>(a) ˝� D 0 and˝M &gt; 1
(b) ˝M D 0 and˝� &gt; 1
11.5. Consider how the scale factor evolves with time (see Fig. 11.2).
</p>
<p>(a) Use the Friedmann equation to obtain an expression for t.a/ in terms of an
integral over a.
</p>
<p>(b) Evaluate the integral for the two cases .˝M ;˝�/ D .1; 0/ and .0; 1/. Fix the
integration constant by setting a D 1 today. Invert the results to find a.t/.
</p>
<p>(c) Now consider more general cases: (i) ˝� D 0 and ˝M &curren; 0; (ii) ˝M D 0
and ˝� &curren; 0. You may find it helpful to use a table of integrals or symbolic
mathematics software.
</p>
<p>11.6. The cosmological lookback time to redshift z is the difference between the
age of the universe now and the age it had at redshift z. In a universe with ˝M D 1
and˝� D 0, find the age of the universe today and the lookback times to z D 1 and
z D 2. (Your results from Problem 11.5 should be useful.)
11.7. In a universe with accelerated expansion, the future will be lonely. Since
galaxies are accelerating away from us but the speed of light is finite, there is some
time in the future when light emitted by a given galaxy will no longer be able to
reach us. Consider ˝M D 0 and ˝� D 1 and find the evolution of the scale factor
(see Problem 11.5). Then use ds2 D 0 for light to compute the time it would take
light emitted from a given galaxy at a given time to reach us. Finally, find the time
when light emitted by the galaxy would take an infinite amount of time to reach us.
How long in the future will we lose contact with a galaxy that is presently 10Mpc
away?</p>

<p>Chapter 12
</p>
<p>Planetary Atmospheres
</p>
<p>We now shift attention from gravity to other aspects of physics that are relevant
for astronomical systems. We begin with gas physics, which has two facets.
Thermodynamics describes the bulk properties of a gas (such as temperature,
density, and pressure), while statistical mechanics describes the microscopic
motions of the particles in the gas. In this chapter we use both to study Earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere in the context of a basic theory of planetary atmospheres.
</p>
<p>12.1 Kinetic Theory of Gases
</p>
<p>We can connect the macroscopic and microscopic pictures of a gas by characterizing
the motions of particles as they move within a container and bump into the walls.
In the simplest version of kinetic theory, we view gas particles as billiard balls that
do not interact except for occasional collisions.
</p>
<p>12.1.1 Temperature and the Boltzmann Distribution
</p>
<p>There are many more particles than we can track individually, so we focus on
statistical properties of the motion such as the distribution of velocities. Elastic
collisions allow particles to exchange energy and momentum and settle into an
equilibrium in which the statistical properties do not change with time. This lets
us invoke a general discovery made by Ludwig Boltzmann (and also Josiah Gibbs):
for a system in equilibrium with temperature T , the number of particles with energy
Ei is
</p>
<p>Ni / gi e�Ei =kT (12.1)

<p>where gi counts the number of different ways in which a particle can have energy
Ei , and k D 1:38�10�23 kgm2 s�2K�1 is the Boltzmann constant. Equation (12.1)
is known as the Boltzmann distribution, and it plays a fundamental role in many
parts of statistical physics.
</p>
<p>In everyday life we measure temperature using the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales,
but in the Boltzmann distribution (and elsewhere in physics) it is better to use the
Kelvin scale. The reason is that Kelvin temperature is directly related to kinetic
energy in a way that we will see shortly. For reference, the Fahrenheit (TF ), Celsius
(TC ), and Kelvin (T ) temperatures are related as follows:
</p>
<p>T D TC C 273:15 D
5
</p>
<p>9
.TF C 459:67/
</p>
<p>12.1.2 Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution of Particle Speeds
</p>
<p>We can use the Boltzmann distribution to derive the distribution of speeds for
particles in a gas, at least in the following idealized scenario:
</p>
<p>1. The motion is non-relativistic.
2. The particles interact only through collisions.
3. The particles have no significant internal structure, so collisions are elastic.
</p>
<p>These assumptions describe an ideal gas, which is simplified but instructive and a
good representation of many real gases. We will check their validity in Sect. 12.1.4.
</p>
<p>Assumption #1 lets us write the kinetic energy of a single particle asK D mv2=2.
Assumptions #2 and #3 tell us there is no potential energy between particles
or internal energy within a given particle, so the total energy of a particle is
just E D mv2=2. This means the Boltzmann distribution will have a factor
of exp.�mv2=2kT /. What about the factor gi? If the motion is isotropic, gi is
a constant. The Boltzmann distribution then gives the number of particles with
velocity between v and v C dv as
</p>
<p>N.v/ dv D C � e�mjvj2=2kT dv

<p>Fig. 12.1 The Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution

<p>Here we write out jvj2 D v2x C v2y C v2z and then recognize that the full integral is a
product of three Gaussian integrals, which can be evaluated using

volume element to replace dv with 4�v2 dv. Then the number of particles with speed
between v and v C dv is

<p>We can understand some general properties of the distribution as follows. The

vanish, hvi D 0. We could instead compute the mean speed, hvi D hjvji. If we are
shifting to speed, though, it actually makes more sense to compute the mean of v2,

<p>12.1.3 Pressure and the Ideal Gas Law
</p>
<p>The macroscopic effect we call pressure arises from particles hitting the walls of
the container. We can use the microscopic picture to derive the equation of state
relating the pressure to other physical properties of the gas.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with motion in the x-direction and then generalize. Suppose the gas
is in a container of length L and cross sectional area A, so the volume is V D AL.
Consider a particle moving to the right with velocity vx and momentum px.2 When
it hits the right-hand wall, the particle rebounds with momentum px in the opposite
direction (assuming an elastic collision). The change in the momentum of the
particle is thus &#129;px D �2px. By Newton&rsquo;s third law, this same impulse is applied
to the wall of the container, but in the opposite direction. The time-averaged force
on the wall is then j&#129;pxj divided by the time between collisions with the right-hand
wall, which is &#129;t D 2L=vx (the particle must traverse the length of the container
twice, going first left and then back right). Thus, the time-averaged force on the right
wall from this one particle is
</p>
<p>fx D
&#129;px
</p>
<p>&#129;t
D vxpx
</p>
<p>L
</p>
<p>The average force on the wall from all particles is
</p>
<p>F D 1
L
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>vx px N.px/ dpx
</p>
<p>where N.px/ dpx is the number of particles whose x-component of momentum is
between px and px C dpx .3 Pressure is then force per unit area:
</p>
<p>2Note that velocity and momentum enter this analysis in different ways. While the two quantities
are related, keeping them separate lets the framework describe either classical or relativistic
motion.
3We could equivalently write the integral in terms of velocity using N.vx/ dvx .</p>

<p>where we recognize AL as the volume of the container so N=.AL/ is the number

</p>
<p>n.px/ dpx
D ntot hvxpxi (12.8)
</p>
<p>where we use Eq. (12.5) to recognize the average of vxpx .
Now we generalize to motion in all directions. For a large collection of particles
</p>
<p>moving randomly, the motion is isotropic and the averages in different directions
are the same:

</p>
<p>vp n.p/ dp (12.10)
</p>
<p>This pressure integral specifies how to compute the pressure from any collection of
particles with a known momentum distribution n.p/. It can handle either classical
or relativistic motion as long as we use the appropriate relation between v and p.
</p>
<p>In particular, for a non-relativistic ideal gas we can use p D mv. Then the

<p>, and dropping the subscript

</p>
<p>This is the famous ideal gas law. You may have seen the law in different forms, but
they are equivalent to this one. For example, since n D N=V we can write
</p>
<p>PV D NkT</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.1 Kinetic Theory of Gases 249
</p>
<p>If we specify the number of moles (rather than the number of particles), we can put
N D N=NA where NA is Avogadro&rsquo;s number and then write
</p>
<p>PV D N RT
</p>
<p>where the &ldquo;gas constant&rdquo; is R D NAk. In this book we use Eq. (12.11) so we can
work with local quantities (e.g., number density) and avoid having to specify the
global size and shape of the container holding the gas.
</p>
<p>Example: Gas Density on Earth
</p>
<p>What is the number density of gas molecules at the surface of Earth? Room
temperature is about T D 293K, and standard air pressure at sea level is about
101 kPa where a Pascal is a unit of pressure: Pa D kgm�1 s�2. Treating the

</p>
<p>12.1.4 Assumptions in the Ideal Gas Law
</p>
<p>Is it reasonable to treat Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere as an ideal gas? Let&rsquo;s check the
assumptions stated in Sect. 12.1.2. We have already seen that molecules in Earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere have speeds of a few hundred meters per second, so the motion is non-
relativistic. Most of the atoms and molecules are electrically neutral, so there is little
electromagnetic interaction between particles. Nuclear forces operate only within
the nucleus, so they are not important across a single atom let alone between atoms.
Gravity between particles is insignificant compared with the gravity from Earth.
(We will see how gravity affects gas in Sect. 12.2.)
</p>
<p>That leaves the question of internal structure. As we will discuss in Chap. 14, all
gas particles have energy levels associated with electron excitation, and molecules
can have additional energy associated with vibrational and rotational motion. The
kinetic energy scale at room temperature, kT D .8:62� 10�5 eVK�1/� .293K/ D
0:025 eV, is too low for collisions to excite electron transitions (which typically
require energies of a few eV), but it may allow collisions to set molecules rotating.
Internal structure does not greatly affect the distribution of particle speeds, though.
In equilibrium, any type of motion that can be excited already will be. Rotational
modes therefore absorb energy in some collisions but give it back in others, so the
overall set of speeds remains close to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.4 On the
whole, then, the assumptions of an ideal gas are not too bad for Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.
</p>
<p>4Internal modes play a more significant role in the specific heat of a gas, which quantifies the
amount of energy required to raise the temperature by a certain amount (see Sect. 16.1.2).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>250 12 Planetary Atmospheres
</p>
<p>To enhance our intuitive picture, let&rsquo;s estimate some characteristic properties of
the gas on a microscopic scale. First, how densely or sparsely are the particles
distributed? More specifically, what fraction of the volume is occupied by the
particles? For simplicity, let&rsquo;s treat each particle as a sphere of radius R, where
the typical size of atoms and molecules is around an Angstrom (1&Aring; D 10�10m).5
The total volume occupied by all particles is � Ntot � .4=3/�R3, so the fraction of
the overall volume that is taken up by particles is
</p>
<p>fV �
Ntot
</p>
<p>V
� 4
3
�R3 � 4
</p>
<p>3
�R3n
</p>
<p>Using R � 3 � 10�10m as an estimate for molecular nitrogen, along with
n � 2:5 � 1025m�3 from above, we estimate fV � 3 � 10�3. The gas around us
is mostly empty space!
</p>
<p>Second, how far do particles typically travel between collisions? This is a
quantity known as the mean free path. With our simple spherical model,6 we say
that each particle has a cross sectional area � � �R2. As a particle travels distance `,
its cross section sweeps out a volume `� , and the number of other particles it
encounters can be estimated as N D `�n. The mean free path is the distance `
such that N � 1:
</p>
<p>` D 1
n�
</p>
<p>� 1
�R2n
</p>
<p>(12.12)
</p>
<p>For Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, the numbers give
</p>
<p>` � 1
� � .3 � 10�10m/2 � .2:5 � 1025m�3/ � 1:4 � 10
</p>
<p>�7m
</p>
<p>While this may seem like a small number, what matters is how it compares with the
size of a particle:
</p>
<p>`
</p>
<p>R
� 1
�R3n
</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is (within a factor of order unity) just the inverse of the volume
fraction, fV . For the numbers we have been using, `=R � 500 and we see that
particles do travel a fairly long way, at least compared with their own size, between
collisions.
</p>
<p>5While atoms and molecules do not have sharp edges and need not be spheres, the simple
assumption is adequate for rough estimates.
6This is appropriate if we think of particles as billiard balls that literally hit one another, but the
concept of cross section can be generalized to other interactions (see Sect. 15.2.3).</p>
<p/>

</p>

</p>
<p>On a human time scale, collisions happen incredibly often. That is what allows the
gas to be in thermodynamic equilibrium.
</p>
<p>12.2 Hydrostatic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>Before we can analyze atmospheres we need one more piece of physics: the effect
of gravity on gas. On Earth, why doesn&rsquo;t gravity pull all the gas particles down to
the surface? As gravity tries to squeeze the gas, the pressure rises until it counteracts
the gravity. Here we seek to specify how gravity and pressure can achieve the
balance that allows gas to be in equilibrium.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine dividing the atmosphere into a number of rectangular volume
elements7 with radial thickness&#129;r and cross sectional area A. Let the mass density
be �, so the mass of this volume element is m D � A&#129;r . The force from gravity is
Fgrav D �mg.r/ where g.r/ is the local acceleration due to gravity, and the minus
sign indicates that the force is downward. Pressure on the bottom of the volume
element creates an upward forceFbottom D AP.r�&#129;r=2/, while pressure on the top
creates a downward force Ftop D �AP.r C&#129;r=2/. In order for the atmosphere to
be in equilibrium, the net vertical force must vanish8:
</p>
<p>AP.r �&#129;r=2/�AP.r C&#129;r=2/�mg.r/ D 0
</p>
<p>Using m D �A&#129;r and rearranging yields
</p>
<p>P.r C&#129;r=2/� P.r �&#129;r=2/
&#129;r
</p>
<p>D �g�
</p>
<p>If &#129;r is sufficiently small, the left-hand side is the derivative9 dP=dr , so we have
</p>
<p>dP
</p>
<p>dr
D �g� (12.13)
</p>
<p>7We could divide space in different ways and still obtain the same result.
8The net horizontal force vanishes by symmetry: the pressure on the &ldquo;left&rdquo; side of the volume
element is balanced by the pressure on the &ldquo;right&rdquo; side, and likewise for the &ldquo;front&rdquo; and &ldquo;back.&rdquo;
9You may be more familiar with the derivative written in terms of ŒP.r C&#129;r/ � P.r/&#141;=&#129;r , but
in the limit&#129;r ! 0 it is equivalent to use ŒP.r C&#129;r=2/� P.r �&#129;r=2/&#141;=&#129;r . By introducing a
derivative, we are assuming that P is a continuous function. While gas is made of discrete particles
on a microscopic scale, the sheer number of particles allows us to treat pressure as effectively
continuous on a macroscopic scale.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>252 12 Planetary Atmospheres
</p>
<p>This is the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, and it is the fundamental equation
for describing gas in a gravitational field. Physically, it says that equilibrium requires
not just pressure but a pressure gradient to offset gravity.
</p>
<p>12.3 Planetary Atmospheres
</p>
<p>As we apply gas physics and gravity to planetary atmospheres, several questions
come to mind: Can we understand the structure of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere? Should
we be surprised that Earth has an atmosphere at all? Why do some bodies (like
Earth) have atmospheres, while others (like the Moon) do not? These are important
questions because life as we know it depends on having an atmosphere.
</p>
<p>12.3.1 Density Profile
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s combine the ideal gas law and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to
construct a model for an atmosphere.We will make two simplifying assumptions:
</p>
<p>&bull; The gas is isothermal, meaning the temperature is the same throughout the
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>&bull; The acceleration due to gravity is constant throughout the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, these conditions do not apply to Earth: temperature tends to
decrease with altitude (think of going to the top of a mountain or up in an airplane),
and gravity weakens with height. However, Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is thin enough
compared with the size of the planet that the assumptions are not too bad. Plus,
making the assumptions lets us obtain a toy model that is instructive.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s replace the general radius r with height above the planet&rsquo;s surface by
writing r D R C h. Let n.h/ be the number density of gas particles at height h,
so the mass density is �.h/ D mn.h/ wherem is the particle mass. The equation of
hydrostatic equilibrium then gives
</p>
<p>dP
</p>
<p>dh
D �mgn.h/
</p>
<p>With the ideal gas law, this becomes
</p>
<p>dP
</p>
<p>dh
D �mg
</p>
<p>kT
P D �P
</p>
<p>H
(12.14)

</p>
<p>(12.15)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.3 Planetary Atmospheres 253
</p>
<p>This quantity has dimensions of length and a physical interpretation that will soon
be apparent. IfH is independent of height, we can solve Eq. (12.14) by rearranging
and integrating:
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>dP
</p>
<p>P
D �
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>dh
</p>
<p>H
</p>
<p>lnP D � h
H
</p>
<p>C constant (12.16)
</p>
<p>P D e�h=H � constant
</p>
<p>Now we see that H characterizes scale height over which the pressure changes
substantially. We can determine the constant by saying the pressure is P0 at the
surface:
</p>
<p>P.h/ D P0 e�h=H (12.17)
</p>
<p>Then from the ideal gas law the number density has the same form:
</p>
<p>n.h/ D n0 e�h=H (12.18)
</p>
<p>where n0 is the number density at the surface. The model we have derived here,
known as the exponential atmosphere, is admittedly idealized but still useful for
understanding a lot of the basic properties of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Aside. If we return to Eq. (12.16) and allowH to vary with height (e.g., because
T changes), we can write the solution in the form
</p>
<p>P / e�
R
</p>
<p>H�1dh
</p>
<p>This is a generalized version of the atmosphere model.
</p>
<p>Example: How Thick Is Earth&rsquo;s Atmosphere?
</p>
<p>We take the scale height to give the characteristic thickness of the atmosphere; in the
exponential model, about 63% of the gas lies between h D 0 and h D H . On Earth,
the average temperature near the surface is around T D 288K, and the acceleration
due to gravity is g D 9:80ms�2. The main components of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere are
molecular nitrogen and molecular oxygen. Plugging in numbers yields:

as constant throughout the atmosphere.)
</p>
<p>Example: Why Are Airplanes Pressurized?
</p>
<p>Airplanes fly at an altitude of around 10 km or 33;000 ft. At that altitude in an
exponential atmosphere, the pressure is
</p>
<p>P.10 km/ D P0 e�.10 km/=H D
(
</p>
<p>0:32 P0 nitrogen
</p>
<p>0:27 P0 oxygen
</p>
<p>In other words, the ambient pressure is too low to breathe or operate comfortably.
</p>
<p>12.3.2 Exosphere
</p>
<p>Where does Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere end? While there is no sharp &ldquo;edge&rdquo; to an
exponential atmosphere, we can consider an effective boundary to be the place
where the mean free path becomes long enough that a particle could escape to
infinity without experiencing a collision. We call this the exosphere. Recall that the
mean free path is ` D .n�/�1 where n is the number density and � is the collision
cross section. If a particle moves a distance dh, the average number of collisions is
n� dh. The total number of collisions when traveling from height h to infinity is
therefore
</p>
<p>p.h/ � �
Z 1
</p>
<p>h
</p>
<p>n.h0/ dh0 (12.19)
</p>
<p>If this number is much less than 1, we can interpret it as the probability for a collision
(which is why we write it as p). Using the exponential atmosphere, we can compute
</p>
<p>p.h/ � n0�
Z 1

<p>e�h
0=H dh0 � n0�H e�h=H �
</p>

</p>
<p>`0
e�h=H
</p>
<p>where `0 � 1=.n0 �/ is the mean free path at Earth&rsquo;s surface. We can invert to find
the height at which the collision probability has some value p:</p>

</p>
<p>(12.20)
</p>
<p>In truth, the exosphere is not sharply defined; we should really consider it to be a
broad region from which air molecules can escape into space. So please do not take
our analysis too literally. But do use it as a guide for understanding the physical
picture of air molecules leaking out of the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Example: Earth
</p>
<p>In Sect. 12.1.4 we estimated `0 � 1:4 � 10�7m, and in Sect. 12.3.1 we obtained
H D 8:7 km for nitrogen. Suppose we consider the exosphere to be the place where
the probability of a collision is 1%, or p D 0:01. Then we estimate the height of
the exosphere to be
</p>
<p>hexo � 260 km
</p>
<p>Note that p appears in a logarithm, so changingp would not change the answer very
much. For example, if we took p D 0:001 we would get hexo � 280 km. Similarly,
the result is not very sensitive to the specific value of `0. Increasing the mean free
path by a factor of 10 would change hexo to 240 km.
</p>
<p>12.3.3 Evaporation
</p>
<p>In discussing the exosphere, we only considered whether particles would be held in
place by collisions. But there is another factor: gravity. A particle can escape only
if it overcomes gravity by exceeding the planet&rsquo;s escape velocity Eq. (2.17). The
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution extends to high speeds, though, so some particles
can in fact escape. We can make a simple estimate of the temperature required
to have a reasonable fraction of particles escape, and a somewhat more detailed
estimate of the time scale for an atmosphere to evaporate.10
</p>
<p>The first thing we might do is compare the escape speed (vesc) and the typical
speed of particles in the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (which we take to be vrms).
If vrms � vesc then the fraction of particles that can escape will be very small.
Conversely, if vrms &amp; vesc then the fraction will be much larger. As a rough estimate,
we might expect that evaporation can occur if
</p>
<p>vesc . 6 vrms
</p>
<p>10This analysis draws from the book by Carroll and Ostlie [1].</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>256 12 Planetary Atmospheres
</p>
<p>The factor of 6 ensures that we count only particles able to escape and roughly
accounts for other restraining effects like collisions and geometry (particles moving
downward will not escape even if they exceed vesc); however, it is somewhat
arbitrary so the following numerical values should be taken as indicative, not
precise. Using vesc from Eq. (2.17) and vrms from Eq. (12.6), we can write the
evaporation condition as
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>2GM
</p>
<p>R
</p>

(12.21)
</p>
<p>This represents a simple criterion that we can use to estimate whether a planet&rsquo;s
atmosphere is hot enough to evaporate.
</p>
<p>Example: Earth and Moon
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider molecular nitrogen since it is the main component of Earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere (see below for other molecules). For Earth, the relevant numbers are
</p>
<p>M D 5:97 � 1024 kg

<p>12.3 Planetary Atmospheres 257
</p>
<p>Earth&rsquo;s gravity is strong enough to hold onto gas particles, but the Moon&rsquo;s gravity
is not.
</p>
<p>We can go a step further and estimate the rate at which particles escape.
Specifically, we imagine that once a particle crosses the exosphere moving upwards
at a speed faster than the escape velocity, it is effectively gone. Therefore the number
of particles&#129;N that escape from areaA in time&#129;t is given by counting all particles
that have speed v &gt; vesc and lie in a layer of thickness vz&#129;t below the exosphere,
where vz is the z-component of the velocity. If n.h; v/ dv is the number density of
particles at height h with velocity between v and v C dv (i.e., the density version of
Eq. 12.2), then we can write:

<p>Even if the rate varies, this is still a useful order-of-magnitude estimate of the
evaporation time.
</p>
<p>Example: Earth
</p>
<p>For Earth&rsquo;s nitrogen-dominated atmosphere, we have already estimated the scale
height and the exosphere. The exosphere is actually warmer than the atmosphere
near the surface because the upper atmosphere is heated by ultraviolet radiation
from the Sun; let&rsquo;s use T � 1;000K, which might seem to exaggerate the effects
of evaporation but is actually a conservative choice (as we will see). The escape
velocity at the exosphere is vesc D 11 kms�1 (which is not very much smaller than
the escape velocity from the surface). In the following table, Column 2 is the particle
mass in units of the proton mass, Column 3 is the peak speed in the Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution, Column 4 is the dimensionless escape parameter xesc from
Eq. (12.22), and finally Column 5 is our estimate of the evaporation time scale.
</p>
<p>For everything except monatomic hydrogen, the evaporation time is longer than
the age of Earth (about 4.5 billion years). Earth can and will hold onto its atmosphere
for a long time.12 (Had we used a lower value of temperature, the evaporation times
would have been longer; that is why using T � 1;000K is a conservative choice.)

</p>
<p>For comparison, the numbers for the Moon are as follows. Because the Moon has no
atmosphere to act as an insulating blanket, the temperature varies quite dramatically
from day to night; the dayside temperature can reach T � 373K. The weak gravity
leads to a low escape velocity (2:4 kms�1 from the surface, or 2:3 km s�1 from an
altitude of 100 km) and to a large scale height (H D 68 km for molecular nitrogen).
With no actual atmosphere it is not clear how to define an exosphere in a meaningful
way; let&rsquo;s set hexo � 100 km as something rather arbitrary but reasonable for an
estimate (and conservative, as we will see).

<p>While the gas speeds are lower than on Earth, the escape velocity is so much
lower that the evaporation time scales are quite short. Even relatively heavy gases
like molecular nitrogen and molecular oxygen would evaporate in a time much
shorter than the age of the Moon. (Had we used a smaller value of hexo, the
evaporation times would have been even shorter.) Now we understand why Earth
has an atmosphere but the Moon does not.

<p>Planetary Temperatures
</p>
<p>In Chap. 12 we saw how a planet&rsquo;s temperature and gravity combine to determine
whether the planet has an atmosphere. In this chapter we study the physical
processes that determine the temperature in the first place. Intuitively, we expect
a planet close to the Sun to be warmer than a planet farther away, but we seek to
quantify that effect.We also consider ways in which a planet&rsquo;s atmosphere can act as
a blanket to trap heat. The physical phenomena that play a role here are blackbody
radiation and the interaction of light with matter.
</p>
<p>13.1 Blackbody Radiation
</p>
<p>A blackbody is a hypothetical object that absorbs all light incident upon it. Since
light carries energy, the object must either heat up or get rid of the excess energy.
Heating a solid object causes it to glow, and a blackbody emits a characteristic
spectrum that depends only on the temperature (not on the size or composition).
While real astrophysical objects are not perfect blackbodies, the blackbody spec-
trum nevertheless provides a good starting point for describing the light emitted by
stars and planets.
</p>
<p>13.1.1 Luminosity
</p>
<p>The relationship between temperature and the total amount of energy emitted
by a blackbody was determined empirically by Josef Stefan, and then explained
theoretically by Ludwig Boltzmann. (We will consider the theory in Sect. 13.1.2.)
The Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity is

more precise about the question: What is the temperature of a blackbody that has
the same size and luminosity as the Sun? This is what we define to be the effective
temperature of the Sun, and while it may not be precisely the same as the physical
temperature in the outer layers of the star it is close enough to be very useful. Using

<p>13.1.2 Spectrum
</p>
<p>Moving beyond the total luminosity, Max Planck discovered a formula that
describes the full spectrum of blackbody radiation. First, let&rsquo;s think about how
it is expressed. We define the wavelength spectrum to be B�.�IT / such that the
luminosity can be written as

<p>Planck considered a box filled with electromagnetic radiation that has a small

<p>This function, which is shown in Fig. 13.1, agrees very well with observed
blackbody spectra. The most precise blackbody spectrum ever measured actually
comes from astrophysics: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation,
which was produced by hot glowing gas in the early universe. As the universe
has expanded, the radiation has effectively cooled such that the spectrum today is
accurately described by a Planck spectrum with a temperature of 2:73K. (We will
study the CMB in Chap. 20.)

<p>13.1.3 Color
</p>
<p>Early studies of blackbody radiation noted that an object&rsquo;s color shifts from red to
orange to yellow (and so on) as the temperature rises. While the blackbody spectrum
contains a mixture of wavelengths (the function is continuous), we can get a sense
of the color by considering the location of the peak in the spectrum. To find the
peak, let&rsquo;s begin by computing the derivative:

</p>
<p>This relation is known as Wien&rsquo;s displacement law after Wilhelm Wien. It quan-
tifies the connection between temperature and color: as temperature increases, the
peak wavelength decreases, so the spectrum shifts toward bluer colors. Notice that
we did not specify anything about the size or shape of the object; Wien&rsquo;s law is
universal for blackbodies.

<p>This is green light. It is no accident that our eyes are most sensitive to light around

spectrum in which the Sun emits most of its light.

</p>
<p>13.1.4 Pressure
</p>
<p>According to Planck, each photon carries energy E D h� D hc=�. According to
relativity, then, we can think of a photon as a massless particle with momentum
p D E=c (see Eq. 10.26), or equivalently p D h�=c D h=�. Particles that carry
momentum can exert pressure (recall Sect. 12.1.3), so we infer that there must be
some pressure associated with light.
</p>
<p>We can compute the pressure by thinking of blackbody radiation as a &ldquo;gas&rdquo; of
photons. The number density of photons with momentum between p and pC dp is
</p>
<p>n.p/ dp D 2
h3
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>epc=kT � 1 4�p
2 dp
</p>
<p>This basically comes from expressing the Planck spectrum (13.10) in terms of
momentum, except that we have switched to number density; note that the factor of
4�p2 dp is the spherical volume element. Using the pressure integral (Eq. 12.10),
we can write the pressure of the photon gas as

</p>
<p>13.2 Predicting Planet Temperatures
</p>
<p>We can now use the properties of blackbody radiation to make a simple model for the
temperature of a planet. The logic is as follows: light from the Sun heats the planet,
causing the planet to radiate. The planet heats up until it reaches an equilibrium state
in which the energy it radiates exactly balances the energy it receives from the Sun.
The model is simplistic because it assumes the temperature and composition are
uniform across the planet, which we know is not true, but using average quantities
yields a model that works surprisingly well. Plus, the model illuminates the basic
physics, which is ultimately the purpose of a simple model.
</p>
<p>In Sect. 13.1.1 we already defined the effective temperature of the Sun, Tˇ,
through the relation Lˇ D 4�R2ˇ�T 4ˇ. By the inverse square law, the energy flux
(energy per unit area per unit time) at a distanceD from the Sun is

4�D2
</p>
<p>D
�R2ˇT
</p>
<p>4
ˇ
</p>
<p>D2
</p>
<p>The total power (energy per unit time) incident on a planet of radius Rp is the flux
times the area of the planet. From the perspective of the Sun, the planet appears to
subtend a circle of area �R2p . Planets are not perfect blackbodies; they reflect part
of the incident light. We define the albedo, a, to be the fraction of the incident light
that is reflected. Thus the fraction of the incident power that is absorbed is .1 � a/,
and the total power that acts to heat the planet is4

</p>
<p>4Here P denotes power, not pressure.</p>

</p>
<p>(13.15)
</p>
<p>Notice that the radius of the planet has dropped out; in this simple model, a planet&rsquo;s
temperature depends only on its distance from the Sun and its albedo (and the
properties of the Sun, of course).
</p>
<p>We have constructed the model using the average temperature and albedo of the
planet. In reality, the absorption and emission properties vary with latitude and
from the day-side to the night-side (not to mention smaller-scale features), and
the variation depends on whether there is much atmosphere to retain and circulate
warmth. We do not attempt to incorporate such details into the model, though.
At this point we just want to see whether this simple model of planet heating can
help us gain a basic understanding of why some planets are hot and others are cold.
</p>
<p>Example: Earth
</p>
<p>Earth lies D D 1AU D 1:50 � 1011m from the Sun and has an average albedo of
a D 0:306. What does this model predict for its average temperature?

</p>
<p>!1=2
</p>
<p>D 254K D �19 degC D �2 deg F
</p>
<p>Not bad for a simple model, but a bit colder than reality. Why? Our analysis actually
applies to the outermost layer of a planet; the situation may be somewhat different
on the surface, if the planet has an atmosphere.
</p>
<p>13.3 Atmospheric Heating
</p>
<p>In order to predict the temperature on the surface of a planet, we need to account
for the fact that an atmosphere can trap heat near the surface. In Sect. 13.4 we
will consider the physical processes by which light can interact with gas in an
atmosphere; for now, let&rsquo;s estimate how much atmospheric heating can warm the
surface.5
</p>
<p>5This analysis is inspired by Problems 19.13 and 20.7 in the book by Carroll and Ostlie [1].</p>

<p>Fig. 13.2 Setup for the one-layer model of atmospheric heating. The atmosphere (dotted line) is
treated as a thin layer at temperature Ta , while the surface (solid line) has temperature Ts . Energy
flux (in units of energy per unit time per unit area) is denoted with arrows. The incident flux is
quantified with Tp from Eq. (13.15). The atmosphere is transparent to the visible light incident
from the Sun, but it absorbs the infrared radiation emitted by the surface and then re-radiates that
energy both upward and downward
</p>
<p>13.3.1 One Layer
</p>
<p>To start, let&rsquo;s make a toy model in which the atmosphere is a thin layer hovering
above the surface of the planet. Suppose the atmosphere is transparent to the visible
light that comes from the Sun, but it absorbs 100% of the infrared radiation emitted
by the planet and then re-radiates that energy. (Again, we will see below how this
happens at the level of atoms and molecules.) Consider the energy flow, quantified
in terms of the energy flux (power per unit area), as sketched in Fig. 13.2:
</p>
<p>&bull; The incident flux from the Sun comes down through the atmosphere with no
effect, and then hits the surface. We can use the analysis from Sect. 13.2 to
quantify the incident flux as �T 4p where Tp is given by Eq. (13.15).
</p>
<p>&bull; The surface has temperature Ts (which is to be determined), so it radiates a flux
�T 4s upward. That flux is absorbed by the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>&bull; The atmosphere has temperature Ta (which is to be determined), so it radiates a
flux �T 4a both upward and downward.
</p>
<p>The net flux incident on Earth is �T 4p , while the net flux leaving Earth is �T
4
a .
</p>
<p>In equilibrium, we must therefore have Ta D Tp . Thus, what Eq. (13.15) predicts is
the temperature of the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>What about the surface? In order for the incident and emitted radiation to balance,
we must have
</p>
<p>�T 4s D �T 4p C �T 4a D 2 �T 4p ) Ts D 21=4 Tp (13.16)
</p>
<p>In this simple model, the atmosphere raises the surface temperature by a factor of
21=4 D 1:19. An increase of 19% may not seem like a lot, but remember that it
applies to the Kelvin temperature.</p>

<p>Fig. 13.3 Setup for the many-layer model of atmospheric heating. Atmospheric layers are labeled
1; : : : ; N from top down (most intermediate layers are not shown here). Energy flux is denoted with
arrows. The layers are transparent to the visible light incident from the Sun, but each layer absorbs
100% of the infrared radiation incident upon it and then re-radiates that energy both upward and
downward
</p>
<p>Example: Earth
</p>
<p>Using Tp D 254K as above, the one-layer model would predict a surface
temperature of Ts D 302K. This is closer to Earth&rsquo;s average surface temperature,
but a little high. The problem, presumably, is the assumption that 100% of the
infrared light emitted by the surface is trapped by the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>13.3.2 Many Layers
</p>
<p>To improve the model we need to handle what is effectively a partial layer. While
it may seem counterintuitive, our best bet is actually to understand what happens
when we add more layers, and then to generalize the notion of layers, so we can
finally circle back to the case of a partial layer.
</p>
<p>Now suppose the atmosphere is made of N layers that transmit visible light but
absorb infrared light. Number the layers from top to bottom and then consider the
energy flow as sketched in Fig. 13.3. Again, we write the incident flux as �T 4p . Now</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.3 Atmospheric Heating 273
</p>
<p>consider the energy balance for each layer; on the left of each equation is the output
flux, and on the right is the input6:
</p>
<p>2T 41 D T 42
2T 42 D T 41 C T 43
2T 43 D T 42 C T 44
</p>
<p>:::

</p>
<p>2T 4N�1 D T 4N�2 C T 4N
2T 4N D T 4N�1 C T 4s
T 4s D T 4N C T 4p
</p>
<p>We also have the condition that the net input to the planet must equal the net output
from the planet. This yields:
</p>
<p>T 41 D T 4p
</p>
<p>Now that we know T1, we can work from the top down:
</p>
<p>T 41 D T 4p
T 42 D 2T 41 D 2T 4p
T 43 D 2T 42 � T 41 D 3T 4p
</p>
<p>:::
</p>
<p>The pattern is clear: the temperature of layer i satisfies
</p>
<p>T 4i D i T 4p ) Ti D i1=4 Tp
</p>
<p>Finally, the last energy balance equation tells us what happens at the surface:
</p>
<p>T 4s D .1CN/T 4p ) Ts D .1CN/1=4 Tp (13.17)
</p>
<p>Addingmore layers creates more heating at the surface,7 with the scaling .1CN/1=4.
</p>
<p>6To get true energy flux we need a factor of � multiplying each T 4, but those all factor out.
7This is why we wear more layers of clothing in the winter.</p>

<p>274 13 Planetary Temperatures
</p>
<p>13.3.3 Optical Depth
</p>
<p>The preceding analysis becomes more applicable to Earth when we generalize the
notion of &ldquo;layers&rdquo; in the atmosphere. What actually matters is the number of times
a photon is absorbed and reemitted between the surface and free space. If the mean
free path of light in the atmosphere is ` D .n�/�1, then the number of interactions
over some distance dx is n� dx. The total number of interactions as light travels
through the atmosphere is then (cf. Eq. 12.19)
</p>
<p>� D
Z
</p>
<p>n� dx (13.18)
</p>
<p>We call this the optical depth because it gives a sense of how far light penetrates
into a gas: roughly speaking, we can see fairly clearly up until the point where
� � 1.
</p>
<p>Since � counts the number of interactions, we can interpret it as the effective
number of layers in the atmosphere. Then we can write our model for atmospheric
heating as
</p>
<p>Ts D .1C �/1=4 Tp (13.19)
</p>
<p>This is a nice generalization because � no longer needs to be an integer. In particular,
we can use a value � &lt; 1 to model an atmosphere that absorbs infrared radiation
partially but not perfectly. In Problem 13.7 you can see how to apply this model to
Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.
</p>
<p>13.4 Interaction of Light with Matter
</p>
<p>In the previous section we postulated that Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere can absorb infrared
light. How does this happen on a microscopic level? More generally, how do light
and matter interact? At the moment we are most interested in how matter absorbs
light, and there are four phenomena that may be relevant:
</p>
<p>&bull; Photoionization: a photon can give enough energy to an electron to knock it out
of its atom/molecule.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electron excitation: a photon can give energy to an electron and cause it to jump
to a higher energy level.
</p>
<p>&bull; Molecular vibration: a photon can cause the atoms in a molecule to vibrate
relative to one another.
</p>
<p>&bull; Molecular rotation: a photon can cause an entire molecule to spin.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.4 Interaction of Light with Matter 275
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider each in turn. For now we want to figure out which phenomena affect
infrared light, but we will encounter all of them in various contexts in coming
chapters.
</p>
<p>13.4.1 Photoionization
</p>
<p>To analyze photoionization, we need to determine what wavelengths of light have
enough energy to unbind an electron. Let&rsquo;s use the Bohr model to estimate the
energy levels of electrons in atoms. In this model we picture the electron in a
classical circular orbit, but we say the angular momentummust be quantized. While
the physical picture is not strictly correct, the resulting energy levels turn out to be
accurate for hydrogen and reasonable for some other elements.
</p>
<p>Consider a single electron orbiting a nucleus with atomic numberZ. The electric
force between the nucleus and electron isZe2=r2, while the force needed to keep the
electron in a circular orbit with speed v is mev2=r . Equating these lets us determine
the orbital speed v and angular momentum L:

</p>
<p>Ze2mer

</p>
<p>We then quantize the angular momentum by setting Ln D n&bdquo; where n is an integer.
This yields the orbital radius for level n:

2! 3 transition has �23 D 6;563&Aring;. These spectral lines will play an important role
when we study stars in Chap. 14. For now, the key point is that electron excitation
occurs at discrete wavelengths of visible and ultraviolet light.
</p>
<p>13.4.3 Molecular Vibration
</p>
<p>In a molecule, light can cause the chemical bonds to vibrate. We can use our tools
of dimensional analysis and toy models to estimate the range of wavelengths that
can excite vibrational motion.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with dimensional analysis. The force involved is the electric force,
so we ought to use e. Since the nuclei themselves move, the mass scale is that
of a proton or neutron. The important length scale is the typical distance r0
between atoms in the molecule. Note that r0 encodes the physics (including quantum
mechanics) that governs the chemical bond and determines the size of the molecule;
we can avoid those details by working with r0 directly. Let&rsquo;s write
</p>
<p>! � e˛ mˇp r
&#13;
0
</p>
<p>ŒT �1&#141; � ŒM ˛=2L3˛=2T �˛ �M ˇ � L&#13; &#141;
</p>
<p>This is solved with ˛ D 1, ˇ D �1=2, and &#13; D �3=2, yielding
</p>
<p>! � e

<p>The angular frequency ! corresponds to a linear frequency � D !=.2�/. The
corresponding wavelength of light is</p>

</p>
<p>This is in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
To make a fully realistic model, we would need to consider the structure of the
</p>
<p>bond between atoms, handle quantummechanics properly, and account for different
vibrational modes. Without getting into all of the details, we can go one step further
by thinking about the bond. In water, the hydrogen and oxygen share a covalent
bond: each atom contributes one electron to a sort of cloud surrounding the two
nuclei.8 Let&rsquo;s make a toy model in which the oxygen and hydrogen ions (each with
charge Ce) are enclosed in a spherical cloud with total charge �2e and radius R.
The oxygen ion is heavier so we imagine it sits motionless at the center of the cloud
while the hydrogen ion moves. Let&rsquo;s suppose the hydrogen oscillates radially. What
is its equation of motion? There is a repulsive force between the two positive ions
of e2=r2. There is also an attractive force due to the portion of the electron cloud
interior to the hydrogen ion&rsquo;s position.9 If the electron cloud has a uniform charge
density, the charge contained within r is�2er3=R3. Thus, the equation of motion is
</p>
<p>m
d2r
</p>
<p>dt2
D e
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>r2
� 2e
</p>
<p>2r
</p>
<p>R3
</p>
<p>How do we analyze this equation? Consider: there is some equilibrium position r0
where the attractive and repulsive forces exactly balance. This is the place where
d2r=dt2 D 0, or
</p>
<p>r0 D
R
</p>
<p>21=3
(13.23)
</p>
<p>Now we imagine the ion makes small excursions around this position. Let&rsquo;s write
</p>
<p>r D r0 C ır D r0
�
</p>
<p>1C ır
r0
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>and imagine that ır � r0. Then we can write the equation of motion as
</p>
<p>8We can picture a cloud for two reasons: according to quantum mechanics the electron wavefunc-
tions are shells; even in classical mechanics, if we took a long-exposure photograph the electrons
would look smeared out due to their motion.
9In analogy with gravity, the portion of the cloud outside the hydrogen ion&rsquo;s position produces no
net force.</p>

<p>Now, the numerical factor is not necessarily precise, because our toy model does
not account for all the details of the real chemical bond. Nevertheless, the model
does contain some real physics (even if simplified), so perhaps it helps you believe
the dimensional analysis.
</p>
<p>13.4.4 Molecular Rotation
</p>
<p>A molecule can also rotate, but perhaps at a different frequency than it vibrates.
Here, dimensional analysis will not involve the electric force, but it will explicitly
involve &bdquo; because that is the natural scale of angular momentum for atoms and
molecules. In this case, the usual dimensional analysis yields

water molecules in food to rotate; friction then disperses the rotational energy as heat.</p>

<p>13.5 Greenhouse Effect and Climate Change 279
</p>
<p>13.4.5 Recap
</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, we can say that the four phenomena we have considered are
important in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum:
</p>
<p>&bull; Photoionization: ultraviolet
&bull; Electron excitation: near-UV and visible
&bull; Molecular vibration: infrared
&bull; Molecular rotation: microwave
</p>
<p>Molecular vibration is the main phenomenon that drives atmospheric absorption of
infrared radiation, with molecular rotation kicking in at the long-wavelength end.
</p>
<p>13.5 Greenhouse Effect and Climate Change
</p>
<p>Atmospheric heating is commonly known as the greenhouse effect. We hear a
lot about the greenhouse effect in connection with global warming and climate
change, but the three phenomena are not exactly identical. The greenhouse effect
is a well-understood physical effect that we know takes place on Earth. (As we
have seen, Earth&rsquo;s surface would be measurably cooler without it.) Global warming
occurs if the greenhouse effect strengthens with time, especially due to changes
caused by humans. An increase in (average) temperature is part of a broader set of
changes to the climate that can develop when the greenhouse effect is increased.
Notwithstanding any political controversy about how we should respond to climate
change, there is no doubt that the greenhouse effect is real.
</p>
<p>13.5.1 Earth
</p>
<p>Detailed studies of molecular rotation lead to the absorption spectra shown in
Fig. 13.4. In Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, water is responsible for most of the absorption
between 1&ndash;8�m and beyond about 20�m. Carbon dioxide is important beyond
14�m, and in a band around 4�m. There is little natural greenhouse effect in an
&ldquo;atmospheric window&rdquo; at 8&ndash;14�m.Using information like this, we canmake a table
showing how much different gases contribute to the greenhouse effect on Earth, and
the degree to which people are concerned about their role in climate change. (Here
ppmDparts per million) [2]
</p>
<p>Notice that the contribution to the greenhouse effect is not dictated by abundance
alone: molecular nitrogen and oxygen are very common, but they are poor absorbers
at infrared wavelengths, so they contribute little to the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>280 13 Planetary Temperatures
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.4 The top panel shows the percentage of light that is absorbed by Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere
as a function of wavelength, running from the visible into the infrared. The bottom panels show
contributions from different gases (Credit: Robert A. Rohde/Global Warming Art)
</p>
<p>Abundance in Contribution to
Molecule Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere greenhouse effect Concern?
</p>
<p>N2 78.1% &ndash; No
O2 20.1% &ndash; No
Ar 0.9% &ndash; No
H2O &lt;1% 60% Indirect
CO2 0.04% 26% % Yes
CH4, N2O 2ppm 6% Yes
O3 0.1 ppm 8% Yes
</p>
<p>Public discussion of climate change focuses on carbon dioxide, whose atmo-
spheric abundance is increasing due to human activity. The fact that atmospheric
CO2 is within our control means we can and should be concerned about it. Industrial
gases containing carbon and fluorine and/or chlorine are also important. While they
are not very abundant, they are efficient absorbers in the 8&ndash;14�m atmospheric
window so even trace amounts can strengthen the greenhouse effect.
</p>
<p>What about water vapor? It contributes the majority of the greenhouse effect,
but we have little direct control over its atmospheric abundance because of natural
evaporation from the oceans.Water vapor plays a complicated role in climate change
because of feedback loops. If the temperature rises, more water can evaporate,
which would strengthen the greenhouse effect and thus raise the temperature even
further. This would be an example of positive feedback, which reinforces any change
that takes place. But there may be another effect: evaporating water can form</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.5 Greenhouse Effect and Climate Change 281
</p>
<p>more clouds, which can reflect more sunlight, which would increase the albedo
and thereby reduce the net energy absorbed from the Sun. That would create
negative feedback, which acts against the prevailing trend and tries to regulate the
temperature.
</p>
<p>Additional factors include snow and ice (whose formation removes water vapor
from the atmosphere and increases the albedo), and forests (which consume carbon
dioxide and have low albedo), to name just two. In detail, climate change is a
complicated process with many connected pieces that climatologists are working
hard to understand fully. Nevertheless, there is solid evidence that the average
temperature of Earth&rsquo;s surface and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
are on the rise. Where there are legitimate scientific questions, they mainly
involve detailed predictions about exactly how the climate will change in the next
century. Even there, though, the question is not whether the climate is changing; the
question is really, &ldquo;how much?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>13.5.2 Venus
</p>
<p>Venus offers an example of what can happenwhen an atmosphere has strong positive
feedback. Today the planet has a thick atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide that
warms the surface to about 740K, far above the temperature of 185K that we would
expect if there were no atmospheric heating.11 Also, the atmospheric pressure at
the surface of Venus is about 90 times higher than at the surface of Earth (and
comparable to the water pressure almost a kilometer down in the oceans on Earth).
</p>
<p>Yet Venus and Earth were probably alike when they were young: the planets are
similar in size, and they presumably formed by similar processes (see Sect. 19.4.2).
What happened? Venus is closer to the Sun, so young Venus would have been a little
warmer than young Earth. That would have caused any water on Venus to evaporate
quickly, loading the atmosphere with water vapor and creating a strong greenhouse
effect. As the temperature rose, carbon dioxide began to &ldquo;bake out&rdquo; of rocks,12
</p>
<p>which created yet more positive feedback and led to a runaway greenhouse effect.
As the atmosphere filled with CO2, the lighter H2O molecules rose to the upper
atmosphere, where they could be dissociated by ultraviolet light from the Sun. Then
the light hydrogen atoms escaped from the atmosphere (see Sect. 12.3.3), leaving
mostly carbon dioxide.
</p>
<p>A tangential aspect of this story makes a testable prediction. A small fraction of
the hydrogen in Venus&rsquo;s atmosphere was actually the isotope deuterium (D, whose
nucleus contains one proton and one neutron). Being heavier, deuterium would
evaporate less quickly than hydrogen, so the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen would
</p>
<p>11Venus&rsquo;s cloud cover creates a high albedo, so the predicted temperature is actually lower than
Earth&rsquo;s even though Venus is closer to the Sun.
12On Earth, most of the carbon is locked up in the crust.</p>
<p/>

<p>282 13 Planetary Temperatures
</p>
<p>rise with time. Today the D/H ratio is about 100 times higher on Venus than on
Earth, supporting the notion that Venus was once wet but the runaway greenhouse
effect has made it such an inhospitable place [3, 4].
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>In several problems, the albedo is relevant but not specified. Recall it must be
</p>
<p>between 0 and 1, and think about whether the specific value affects your conclusions.
</p>
<p>If it does, explain any assumptions you make.
</p>
<p>13.1. Is a blackbody actually black? Explain. How would you determine if a given
object emits electromagnetic radiation like a blackbody?
</p>
<p>13.2. In common usage, we sometimes call things &ldquo;red hot&rdquo; or &ldquo;white hot.&rdquo; Which
is hotter? Explain.
</p>
<p>13.3. Rank the following stars by luminosity:
</p>
<p>Star R (Rˇ) T (Tˇ)
</p>
<p>A 0.5 0.5
B 1.0 2.0
C 1.5 1.0
D 20.0 1.0
</p>
<p>13.4. In the Sirius binary system (see Problem 4.4b), star A has a luminosity of
25:4Lˇ and the peak in its spectrum is at 292 nm, while star B has a luminosity
of 0:026Lˇ with peak emission at 115 nm. Treating these stars as blackbodies,
what physical properties of the stars can you determine from the information given?
Calculate at least two properties for each star.
</p>
<p>13.5. The star HD 209458 has mass Ms D 1:13Mˇ, luminosity Ls D 1:61Lˇ,
and surface temperature T D 6;000K. It is orbited by a planet with mass Mp D
0:69MJ and radiusRp D 1:35RJ that lies 0.045 AU from the star (see Sect. 4.3.2).
The size and mass of the planet suggest it is a gaseous planet like Jupiter, but it is so
close to its star that it must be hotter than Jupiter. Would you expect hydrogen to be
able to evaporate from the planet? Explain, and be quantitative.
</p>
<p>13.6. Consider the planet orbiting the star HD 209458 (see data in Problem 13.5).
Treating both objects as blackbodies, compute the brightness of the planet relative
to the star at the following wavelengths: � D 450 nm (blue light), � D 700 nm
(red light), and � D 2:2 �m (infrared light). Consider both starlight reflected off
the planet and blackbody light emitted by the planet itself. Explain your reasoning.
If you want to detect light from this exoplanet, which of these three wavelengths is
the best choice?</p>

</p>
<p>The phenomena that affect the transmission of light through planetary atmospheres
also operate in stellar atmospheres. For planets, our interest in infrared light led us
to focus on molecular vibrations. For stars, we are more interested in visible light
so our attention shifts to electron excitation and ionization. In this chapter we study
how those processes affect the absorption lines that appear in stellar spectra.
</p>
<p>14.1 Atomic Excitation and Ionization
</p>
<p>Observed spectra of stars resemble blackbody spectra modified by absorption bands
at specific wavelengths (see Figs. 14.1 and 14.2). The absorption lines are produced
when light that originates from some modest depth passes through the star&rsquo;s outer
layers.1 The gas in stars is predominantly hydrogen, so we might expect to see strong
hydrogen absorption lines. Recall from Eq. (13.22) that the transition between
hydrogen energy levels n and m corresponds to wavelength

2. In a non-negligible fraction of atoms, level n must be occupied but level m must
</p>
<p>not be full.
</p>
<p>Consider point #2. In isolation, an atom generally has all of its electrons in the
lowest possible energy levels. In a gas, however, atoms occasionally bump into each
other, and some of the kinetic energy can be transferred to internal energy. The
temperature and associated kinetic energy in stellar atmospheres are high enough
that collisions can excite electrons into higher energy levels.
</p>
<p>The amount of collisional excitation depends on the kinetic energy, which in turn
depends on the temperature. To quantify this effect, recall from Eq. (12.1) that the
probability for level n to be occupied is
</p>
<p>Pn / gn e�En=kT
</p>
<p>where En is the energy and gn is the statistical weight, which in this case counts
the number distinct quantum states in the energy level. The ratio of the number of
atoms with level m occupied to the number with level n occupied is then

<p>This Boltzmann equation allows us to determine which energy levels are signifi-
cantly occupied and analyze whether absorption lines will be strong or weak.
</p>
<p>14.1.2 Ionization Stages
</p>
<p>A collision with sufficient energy can kick an electron out of an atom altogether.
This influences absorption lines because electrons that are not in atoms cannot
produce atomic transitions, and the loss of an electron may modify the energy
levels for any remaining electrons in an atom. It is conventional to label different
ionization stages with Roman numerals:</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>I. Neutral
II. Singly-ionized
III. Doubly-ionized
</p>
<p>and so on. Consider a transition that starts with a neutral atom (stage I) whose most
loosely bound electron has energy EI D ��I , where �I &gt; 0 is the ionization
energy, and ends with a stage II ion plus a free electron with speed ve or energy
EII D mev2=2. The energy difference between the two states is &#129;E D EII �
EI D �I C mev2=2, so the relative abundance of ionized and neutral atoms has a
Boltzmann factor of the form

<p>The key factors here are e��I =kT and .kT /3=2.
There are a few more details that enter a complete analysis. First, the number
</p>
<p>density of free electrons must play a role. It appears in the denominator because
free electrons can combine with ions and return them to a neutral stage. Second,
where we used statistical weights to count states for the Boltzmann equation, we
must now use a more general counting that is done with the partition function,2

</p>
<p>where E1 is the energy of the ground state. This is basically the sum of the number
of ways the atom can arrange its electrons, with more energetic (and therefore
less likely) configurations receiving less weight from the Boltzmann factor. Careful
counting reveals that the ratio of the number of atoms in ionization stage II to the
number in stage I is

<p>This is called the Saha equation after Meghnad Saha.
Hydrogen only has two ionization stages: neutral (H I) and ionized (H II). For
</p>
<p>heavier elements, higher ionization stages are possible, and the Saha equation can be
applied to them as well. For example, the ratio of doubly ionized atoms (like He III)
to singly ionized atoms (like He II) would be described by an equation like (14.3)
but with the second ionization energy �II and the partition functionsZIII and ZII
(see Problem 14.1).
</p>
<p>14.1.3 Application to Hydrogen
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use these ideas to study hydrogen Balmer lines. These occur when an electron
jumps from level n D 2 up to level m &gt; 2, so they are strong only if a reasonable
fraction of hydrogen atoms have electrons in the n D 2 level. Before we can use
the Boltzmann equation to compute that fraction, we need to specify the statistical
weight for hydrogen:
</p>
<p>gn D 2n2
</p>
<p>The n2 comes from the orbital quantum numbers, while the 2 comes from spin.
Using Tˇ D 5;780K for the Sun yields the following numbers:
</p>
<p>kT D 7:98 � 10�20 J D 0:498 eV
E1 D �13:6 eV
E2 D �3:4 eV
g1 D 2
g2 D 8

<p>) n2
n1
</p>
<p>D g2
g1
</p>
<p>e�.E2�E1/=kT D 5 � 10�9 (14.4)
</p>
<p>Only a tiny fraction of hydrogen atoms in the outer layers of the Sun are excited to
n D 2, which is why Balmer lines are not very prominent in the spectrum of the
Sun. The excitation fraction increases with temperature, as shown in Fig. 14.3, so in
general we would expect Balmer lines to be more prominent in hotter stars.
</p>
<p>However, as the temperature increases, so too does the ionization fraction.
At some point ionization must overcome excitation and prevent hot stars from
producing any hydrogen absorption lines. We can investigate this using the Saha
equation, but first we need to determine the partition functions. The starting point is
neutral hydrogen, whose partition function is</p>

<p>We want determine the ionization fraction, X . Let the number densities of
hydrogen ions and neutral atoms be nII and nI , respectively, and the total number
density of hydrogen be ntot D nI C nII . By the definition of the ionization
fraction, nII D Xntot and nI D .1 � X/ntot. Then the left-hand side of the Saha
equation (14.3) becomes nII =nI D X=.1 � X/. The right-hand side has a factor

contrast, is much less sensitive toX (because electrons contribute so little mass). As
we will see shortly, the ionization fraction in the Sun&rsquo;s photosphere is quite low so to
a good approximationwe can take the mean particle mass to be the mass of a neutral
hydrogen atom, Nm � mp , and then compute the mass density as � D NmP=kT

to recombine into neutral atoms, which reduces the equilibrium ionization fraction
at a given temperature.</p>

<p>Fig. 14.4 Ionization fraction X for hydrogen, as a function of temperature, assuming the pressure

</p>
<p>We can combine the Boltzmann and Saha analyses to determine the fraction of
hydrogen atoms that are neutral and in the first excited state. If we assume that very
few neutral atoms are excited beyond the first excited state, we can use nI � n1Cn2
to write

</p>
<p>.1 � X/
</p>
<p>The first factor involves n2=n1 from Fig. 14.3 while the second factor has X from
Fig. 14.4. Putting them together yields Fig. 14.5, where we focus on the top of
the photosphere because more absorption lines are produced there than at the
bottom. For the assumed mass density, the excitation fraction n2=ntot peaks for
a photospheric temperature of around 12;000K. We need to be a little careful
when interpreting this result because the mass density would not necessarily
remain fixed as the temperature varies, and the density we have assumed for the
Sun would not necessarily apply to stars with different masses. Nevertheless, our
simplified analysis suggests that hydrogen Balmer lines will be most prominent
in stars with photospheric temperatures in the ballpark of 10;000&ndash;15;000K, which
is in fact what we see. And we understand why: at cooler temperatures, too little
hydrogen is excited into the state that can produce Balmer absorption lines; while at
hotter temperatures, too much of the hydrogen is ionized.</p>

</p>
<p>14.2 Stellar Spectral Classification
</p>
<p>Now we understand that the appearance of spectral lines is governed not only by
the composition of stellar atmospheres, which is to be expected, but also by the
temperature, which is less obvious but no less important. Using the physics of
atomic excitation and ionization, we can comprehend the key patterns observed in
stellar spectra.
</p>
<p>In the 1890s, astronomers at Harvard College Observatory amassed a large
collection of stellar spectra. The Observatory employed many women (who were
known at the time as &ldquo;computers&rdquo;) to analyze astronomical data. Williamina
Fleming developed a taxonomy in which spectra were classified based on the
strength of their hydrogen absorption lines. A stars had the strongest lines, B stars
the next strongest, and so forth. Annie Jump Cannon then consolidated the spectral
classes and discovered that the order &ldquo;O B A F G K M&rdquo; corresponds to a sequence
in temperature, running from hot to cool.3 Figures 14.1 and 14.2 show that the peak
of the spectrum shifts with temperature (Wien&rsquo;s law) and the set of absorption lines
varies as listed in Table 14.2.4
</p>
<p>One additional pattern in star properties was discovered in the early 1900s
by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Working independently, they
compared the spectral classes and luminosities of different stars in a plot now called
the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram (see Fig. 14.6). Stars do not scatter across
</p>
<p>3People have invented a variety of mnemonics to remember the sequence. What&rsquo;s yours?
4Recently the spectral sequence has been extended to include types L, T, and Y for low-mass stars
known as brown dwarfs whose cores are not hot enough for normal hydrogen fusion to occur (see
Problem 16.5).</p>

runs from the upper left (hot, bright stars) to the lower right (cool, dim stars); this is
known as the main sequence.
</p>
<p>Another grouping of stars is seen in the upper right portion of the HR diagram.
What can we say about these stars, in comparison with main sequence stars? Stars
of a given spectral type have the same temperature, so how can they have such
different luminosities? Going back to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Eq. 13.1), recall
that luminosity and (effective) temperature are related by
</p>
<p>L D 4�R2�T 4eff</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Compared to main sequence stars, stars in the upper right are more luminous, so
they must be larger. This is the region of giant stars. Most of these stars have K and
M spectral types, which correspond to cool temperatures and red colors, so they are
red giants. Red giants can be 100&ndash;10,000 times brighter than main sequence stars
with similar temperatures, so they must be 10&ndash;100 times bigger.
</p>
<p>Finally, a third grouping is seen in the lower left of the HR diagram. They are
less luminous than main sequence stars of the same spectral type, so they must
be smaller. Because these stars are generally hot and white, they are called white
dwarfs.
</p>
<p>One of our goals for the coming chapters is to understandwhat physical processes
create the patterns seen in the HR diagram.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>14.1. In the text we analyzed hydrogen to understand the presence of Balmer lines
in stellar spectra. Now consider helium. The presence of two electrons allows more
configurations; here are the statistical weights and energies of the first five energy
levels of neutral helium:
</p>
<p>n gn En (eV)
</p>
<p>1 1 �24:59
2 3 �4:77
3 1 �3:97
4 9 �3:63
5 3 �3:37
</p>
<p>Helium has three ionization stages: I is neutral, II is singly-ionized (one electron
removed), and III is doubly-ionized (both electrons removed). The ionization energy
to go from I to II is �I D 24:6 eV, while to go from II to III it is �II D 54:4 eV.
The partition functions for the three stages are ZI D 1, ZII D 2, andZIII D 1.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>296 14 Stellar Atmospheres
</p>
<p>(a) Neutral helium is observed to have absorption lines at wavelengths of 447.1,
438.7, and 402.6 nm (to name a few). Do these absorption lines correspond to
transitions between any of the energy levels listed above? Explain.
</p>
<p>(b) These absorption lines correspond to transitions in which an electron jumps
from level 4 to a higher level. This can happen only if atoms are excited to
level n D 4. Use the Boltzmann equation to compute N4=N1 for stars with
surface temperature T D 25;000K (an O star), T D 14;000K (a B star), and
T D 9;000K (an A star).
</p>
<p>(c) Why have we focused on transitions starting from level 4, rather than level 3?
Compute N4=N3 for our three sample stars (O, B, and A). Explain why level 4
has a higher occupation despite having a higher energy.
</p>
<p>(d) Now compute the helium ionization fraction for our three sample stars. Since
stars have more hydrogen than helium, assume the factor of ne is dominated by
electrons from ionized hydrogen, drawing on our analysis in Sect. 14.1.3.
</p>
<p>(e) Using your results from parts (b) and (d), explain whether you would expect to
see neutral helium lines, ionized helium lines, or no helium lines at all in O, B,
and A stars.
</p>
<p>14.2. As we will see later (Sect. 16.3), a planetary nebula is an expanding shell
of gas expelled by a low-mass star near the end of its life. Planetary nebulae are
observed to have a prominent emission line from oxygen5 at 5,007&Aring;, which is

say about the temperature of the gas from knowing that a significant fraction of
the oxygen atoms are collisionally excited? You may assume the lower and higher
energy states have the same statistical weight.

<p>Nuclear Fusion
</p>
<p>To this point we have viewed star temperatures and luminosities as empirical
quantities, but now we seek to understand them in terms of physical processes that
occur deep within stars. Nuclear fusion provides a potent power source, and studying
fusion reveals a link between properties of astrophysical objects and reactions that
occurs on scales more than 20 orders of magnitude smaller.
</p>
<p>15.1 What Powers the Sun?
</p>
<p>Before delving into the physics of fusion, it is worthwhile to consider why that is the
only source of energy that could power the Sun. At stake is the total energy emitted
by the Sun during its lifetime. The Sun&rsquo;s present luminosity is 3:84 � 1026 J s�1,
and the age of the Solar System inferred from radiometric dating of rocks and
meteorites is about 4:5Gyr � 1:4 � 1017 s. Even if the Sun was a little dimmer in
the past (see Sect. 16.3.1), we can safely estimate that the Sun has already released
more than 1043 J in light. What is the source of that energy?
</p>
<p>Gravitational energy? The gravitational potential energy of an object of mass
M and radius R is U � �GM 2=R (see Sect. 8.2.1). If the object shrinks without
losing mass then U decreases (becomes more negative). The process of releasing
energy by gravitational contraction is known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism.
If the Sun was initially large enough that its gravitational potential energy was
roughly zero, the amount of gravitational energy it could have released by now is
</p>
<p>&#129;U �
GM 2ˇ

</p>
<p>� 4 � 1041 J
</p>
<p>There is a dimensionless factor of order unity that depends on how the density
changes with radius, and an additional factor of 1=2 because, according to the virial
theorem (see Sect. 8.1.3) only half of the energy can be radiated (the other half

<p>goes into kinetic energy). Thus, as an order-of-magnitude estimate we can say that
something like Etot � 1041 J could have been released by gravitational collapse.
At its current luminosity the Sun would radiate this amount of energy in a time

<p>� 10
41 J
</p>
<p>3:84 � 1026 J s�1 � 3 � 10
14 s � 8 � 106 yr
</p>
<p>This is far too short compared with the age of the Solar System. The Sun cannot be
powered by gravitational energy alone.
</p>
<p>Chemical energy? Chemical reactions can release energy by rearranging elec-
trons in atoms and molecules. The energy scale is set by the difference between
electron energy levels. If we optimistically assume that each atom can release
E1 D 10 eV, the energy available from all atoms is Etot D NE1. If we assume
the Sun is pure hydrogen, the total number of atoms is N �Mˇ=mp � 1:2� 1057.
Then
</p>
<p>Etot � 1:2 � 1058 eV �
1:60 � 10�19 J

<p>3:84 � 1026 J s�1 � 5:0 � 10
12 s � 160;000 yr
</p>
<p>The Sun cannot be powered by chemical energy, either.
Nuclear energy? Nuclear reactions involve energies in the range of MeV,
</p>
<p>and thus provide something like a million times more energy than chemical
reactions. Specifically, nuclear fusion involves the conversion of mass into energy
via E D mc2. If the entire mass of the Sun were converted to energy in this way,
the total energy released would be
</p>
<p>Etot � Mˇc2 � .1:99 � 1030 kg/ � .3:0 � 108ms�1/2 � 2 � 1047 J
</p>
<p>which would correspond to a lifetime of
</p>
<p>t � 2 � 10
47 J
</p>
<p>3:84 � 1026 J s�1 � 5 � 10
20 s � 1013 yr
</p>
<p>In practice, the total energy available from fusion is less than this, because only a
small fraction of mass is converted into energy in each reaction, and only a portion
of matter in the Sun can undergo fusion. (We quantify these fractions below.) Even
so, nuclear fusion provides ample energy to power the Sun.</p>

</p>
<p>15.2 Physics of Fusion
</p>
<p>Fusion occurs when two lighter nuclei combine to create a heavier nucleus. The
process can release energy because the mass of the final nucleusmay be less than the
combined mass of the starting nuclei; the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; mass gets converted to energy
(such that the total mass/energy is conserved). In this section we study the physics
of fusion to understand the conditions under which fusion can occur and the rate at
which energy is released.1
</p>
<p>15.2.1 Mass and Energy Scales
</p>
<p>To discuss fusion we need to be more precise than we have been about the masses
of particles and nuclei. Given the focus on energy, it is common to quote masses in
terms of equivalent energies using m D E=c2; the corresponding unit is MeV/c2.
The masses of the three familiar fundamental particles are:
</p>
<p>Proton mp D 938:272MeV=c2
Neutron mn D 939:565MeV=c2
Electron me D 0:511MeV=c2
</p>
<p>We will see in Sect. 15.3 that the reaction powering the Sun is the fusion of 4
hydrogen nuclei into a helium nucleus. The mass involved are2
</p>
<p>4 hydrogen 4mH D 3;753:09MeV=c2
</p>
<p>helium mHe D 3;727:38MeV=c2
</p>
<p>The amount of mass that gets converted to energy is3
</p>
<p>&#129;m D 25:71MeV=c2
</p>
<p>The fraction of the original mass that goes into energy is sometimes called the
efficiency of a nuclear reaction,

mstart
</p>
<p>D &#129;m
mstart
</p>
<p>1Parts of this presentation draw on the books by Carroll and Ostlie [1] and Maoz [2].
2These are masses of nuclei; they do not include electrons. In the core of the Sun where fusion
occurs, atoms are ionized (see Sect. 16.2.2).
3There may be a little additional energy released when electrons annihilate with anti-electrons (see
Sect. 15.3.3), but we are focusing on nuclear masses.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>302 15 Nuclear Fusion
</p>
<p>With this definition we can write the energy released when some massM undergoes
fusion as
</p>
<p>E D �Mc2
</p>
<p>For hydrogen fusing into helium, the efficiency is � D 0:007.
How much fusion energy is available in the Sun? A first estimate is:
</p>
<p>E � 0:007 �Mˇ c2 � 1:3 � 1045 J
</p>
<p>This could power the Sun for a lifetime of
</p>
<p>t � 1:3 � 10
45 J
</p>
<p>3:84 � 1026 J s�1 � 3:3 � 10
18 s � 1011 yr
</p>
<p>In practice, only about 10% of the Sun&rsquo;s mass can undergo fusion, so the actual
energy and lifetime are about a factor of 10 smaller.
</p>
<p>15.2.2 Requirements for Fusion
</p>
<p>Why does only a portion of the Sun&rsquo;s mass ever participate in fusion? Fusion
requires high temperatures and densities that occur only in the core of the Sun.
To understand why, note that nuclei have positive charges and thus repel each other
through the Coulomb force. Fusion can occur only if the nuclei get close enough
for the strong nuclear force to take over and create an attractive force that binds
nuclear particles together (see Fig. 15.1). The strong force operates over scales of
femtometers (1 fm D 10�15m), so we need to consider the conditions under which
nuclei are able to overcome Coulomb repulsion and get close enough for the strong
force to come into play.
</p>
<p>Classical Analysis
</p>
<p>The center of the Sun is hot, so nuclei are zipping around and bumping into one
another. Is this enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier between nuclei? Thinking
in terms of classical physics, we would say that fusion can occur only if the kinetic
energy is above the height of the Coulomb barrier. For a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution of velocities (see Sect. 12.1.2), the typical kinetic energy is
</p>
<p>kinetic energy � 3

kT
</p>
<p>If rs is the scale on which the strong nuclear force acts, the height of the Coulomb
barrier is</p>

<p>Fig. 15.1 A simple Coulomb barrier between two nuclei. At large separations, Coulomb repulsion
leads to a V .r/ / 1=r potential. At small separations, the strong nuclear force creates a deep
potential well. If a particle approaches from the right with an energy E that is lower than the peak,
a classical analysis would say the particle can never reach the inner potential well. According to
quantum mechanics, however, the particle can tunnel through the barrier. The tunneling probability
is analyzed in Sect. 15.2.3

<p>3 � .1:38 � 10�23 kgm2 s�2K�1/ � .10�15m/ � 10
10K
</p>
<p>The center of the Sun is hot (1:6 � 107K), but not this hot. According to classical
physics, fusion should not occur in the Sun.
</p>
<p>Quantum Analysis
</p>
<p>The picture changes when we consider quantum physics, thanks to tunneling.
In the language of quantum mechanics, we discuss not particles themselves but
rather their wavefunctions, which characterize the probability of finding particles in
particular positions (or other quantum states). Approaching a barrier in the potential,
a wavefunction need not vanish; it can penetrate the barrier and, if the barrier is not</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>304 15 Nuclear Fusion
</p>
<p>too thick, come out the other side with an amplitude that is smaller but still finite.
This corresponds to a finite probability for the particle to &ldquo;jump through&rdquo; the barrier.
</p>
<p>Tunneling means that particles do not necessarily have to have enough energy
to go over the Coulomb barrier; they just need enough energy to tunnel through it.
Tomake a toy model of this effect, recall wave/particle duality.We have already seen
that wavelength and momentum are related for light through the relation � D h=p
(see Sect. 13.1.4). Louis de Broglie suggested that the same idea applies to massive
particles like electrons and nuclei. We imagine, then, that bringing two nuclei within
a de Broglie wavelength of one another will allow them to tunnel through the
Coulomb barrier and fuse (we will be more careful about the criterion below). Using
p D h=�, we can write the kinetic energy as
</p>
<p>kinetic energy D 1

�v2 D p
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>2�
D h
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>2��2
</p>
<p>where � D m1m2=.m1 C m2/ is the reduced mass of the system.4 The Coulomb
barrier has the same form as before, but now we take the separation to be �:

</p>
<p>The kinetic energy matches the Coulomb barrier for

</p>
<p>This is quite close to the central temperature of the Sun.While our toy model should
not be taken too literally, it does suggest that tunneling enables fusion in the Sun and
therefore deserves a more careful treatment.
</p>
<p>4We can work in the center of mass frame and convert the two-body Coulomb problem into an
equivalent one-body problem, as we did with gravity in Sect. 4.1. The relevant mass is then the
reduced mass.</p>

<p>15.2 Physics of Fusion 305
</p>
<p>15.2.3 Cross Section
</p>
<p>The preceding analysis gives a general sense of the conditions required for fusion
to be possible. Now let&rsquo;s get more specific. In Chap. 12 we saw that it is useful to
discuss interactions between particles in terms of the cross section. Previously we
pictured billiard ball collisions and took the cross section to be the physical size of
the objects, but now we introduce a more general definition:
</p>
<p>�.E/ D number of reactions / nucleus / time
number of incident particles / area / time
</p>
<p>D ŒL2&#141; (15.1)
</p>
<p>We write �.E/ for nuclear reactions because the ability to cross the Coulomb barrier
depends on energy. While the full energy dependence may be quite complicated,
there are some key factors that we can identify.
</p>
<p>First, the &ldquo;size&rdquo; of a nucleus is either its physical size or its de Broglie
wavelength, whichever is larger. To estimate the de Broglie wavelength, we take
the momentum to be p � �vrms where � is the reduced mass and vrms D
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>3kT=�
</p>
<p>is the typical particle speed (see Eq. 12.6). At the center of the Sun, T D 1:6�107K
(see Sect. 16.2.2) and hence kT D 2:2 � 10�16 J. Using � D mp=2 for hydrogen
then yields
</p>
<p>� � h
.3�kT /1=2
</p>
<p>� .6:626 � 10
�34 kgm2 s�1/
</p>
<p>Œ3 � .8:36 � 10�28 kg/ � .2:2 � 10�16 kgm2 s�2/&#141;1=2
</p>
<p>� 10�12m
</p>
<p>This is much larger than the physical size of a nucleus (�10�15m), so we can
approximate the effective size of a nucleus as �. Therefore we expect the cross
section to scale as
</p>
<p>�.E/ / �2 /
�
</p>
<p>h
</p>
<p>�v
</p>
<p>�2
</p>
<p>/ 1
E
</p>
<p>(15.2)
</p>
<p>Second, we need to account for the tunneling probability. Below we derive the
probability for tunneling through a simple, fixed Coulomb barrier and show that
it has the form
</p>
<p>P D e�.Ec=E/1=2 (15.3)
</p>
<p>where the energy scale Ec is defined by
</p>
<p>Ec �
2�2Z21Z

2e
4�
</p>
<p>&bdquo;2 (15.4)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>306 15 Nuclear Fusion
</p>
<p>Even if the real interaction is more complicated than we have considered here, the
two factors we have identified in Eqs. (15.2) and (15.3) should capture the strongest
energy dependence. We therefore write
</p>
<p>�.E/ D S.E/
E
</p>
<p>e�.Ec=E/
1=2
</p>
<p>(15.5)
</p>
<p>and bundle any remaining effects into S.E/, which is called the nuclear S-factor.
In principle, S.E/ needs to be determined for each reaction (mainly from experi-
mental data; e.g., [3, 4]). However, in the next section we will see that knowing the
details of S.E/ is not essential for a general understanding of fusion (although it is
vital for detailed investigations, of course).
</p>
<p>Tunneling Probability
</p>
<p>Quantum tunneling through a barrier that is wide compared with the de Broglie
wavelength of a particle can be analyzed in the standard WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-
Brillouin) approximation of quantum mechanics. (For more details, see Chap. 8 of
Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths [5] or a similar textbook.) Consider
a barrier with potential V.r/. Conservation of energy gives the momentum:
</p>
<p>E D p
2
</p>
<p>2�
C V.r/ ) p.r/ D f2�ŒE � V.r/&#141;g1=2
</p>
<p>where � is the reduced mass of the system. If the energy E is below the peak of
V , then p.r/ is imaginary within the barrier, but that is not a problem in a quantum
analysis. The WKB approximation gives the probability that the particle can tunnel
through the barrier as P such that
</p>
<p>lnP � �2&bdquo;
</p>
<p>Z r2
</p>
<p>rs

<p>The integral can then be evaluated as follows:

</p>
<p>15.2.4 Reaction Rate
</p>
<p>The cross section is one important factor in determining how many reactions occur.
Another is the sheer number of nuclei that have the required energy. To figure out
how to compute the reaction rate, let&rsquo;s go back to the definition of cross section
(Eq. 15.1). The particles that can interact with a target nucleus in some time dt are
those in a cylinder whose cross sectional area is � and length is v dt . The number of
reactions per nucleus in time dt can therefore be written as
</p>
<p># reactions per nucleus D
Z
</p>
<p>n2.v/ � v dt dv
</p>
<p>where n2.v/ dv is the number density of particles with speeds between v and vC dv.
Consider a volume V that contains N1 target nuclei. To get the total number
</p>
<p>of reactions for all the nuclei, multiply the previous expression by N1. To get the
number of reactions per unit volume, divide by V . Finally, to get the number of
reactions per unit volume per unit time, divide by dt . The result is the reaction
rate,
</p>
<p>r12 � number of reactions per unit volume, per unit time D n1
Z
</p>
<p>n2.v/ � v dv
</p>
<p>where n1 D N1=V is the number density of nuclei. Using the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution for n2.v/ gives5

</p>
<p>5Now n2 indicates the total number density of reactants. We could write it as n2;tot following
Eq. (12.3), but we omit &ldquo;tot&rdquo; to simplify the notation.</p>

reactions),6 we can approximate S.E/ by its value at E0 and pull S.E0/ out of the
integral. Then the integral can be evaluated analytically, using the method outlined
in Problem 15.4.

<p>15.2 Physics of Fusion 309
</p>
<p>Since fusion typically involves nuclei in a fairly narrow range of energies,
the reaction rate can increase dramatically as the temperature increases and more
particles are brought into the fusion energy range. It is convenient to characterize
such a rapid temperature dependence as a power law relation,
</p>
<p>r12 / T ˛
</p>
<p>How do we determine the power law index, ˛? First, let&rsquo;s write the relation as
</p>
<p>r12 D C T ˛
</p>
<p>where C is a multiplicative factor that does not depend on temperature. Consider
the derivative:
</p>
<p>dr12
dT
</p>
<p>D ˛ CT ˛�1 D ˛r12
T
</p>
<p>Therefore we can compute the power law index as
</p>
<p>˛ D T
r12
</p>
<p>dr12
dT
</p>
<p>(15.10)
</p>
<p>Alternatively, take the logarithm of the original relation:
</p>
<p>ln r12 D ln .CT ˛/ D lnC C ˛ lnT
</p>
<p>Then we can find ˛ using
</p>
<p>˛ D d.ln r12/
d.lnT /
</p>
<p>which is mathematically equivalent to Eq. (15.10). Using either method, you can
show in Problem 15.4 that the power law index for the fusion reaction rate has the
form

nuclei involved in fusion have energies about three times the RMS value. While
such nuclei are not right at the peak of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, they
are still sufficiently abundant to make fusion work as an energy source.
</p>
<p>15.3 Nuclear Reactions in Stars
</p>
<p>Having discussed the general theory of fusion, we can now consider the specific
reactions that occur in stars.
</p>
<p>15.3.1 Cast of Characters
</p>
<p>The first step is to list all the particles that might participate in nuclear reactions. The
elements in the periodic table are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. All
three particles have alternate versions called antimatter obtained by reversing the
electric charge:
</p>
<p>Matter Antimatter
</p>
<p>Electron, e� $ Positron, eC
Proton, p $ Antiproton, Np
Neutron, n $ Antineutron, Nn</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.3 Nuclear Reactions in Stars 311
</p>
<p>When matter and antimatter come together, they annihilate into energy in the form
of photons of light (denoted by &#13; ):
</p>
<p>e� C eC ! 2&#13;
Two photons are needed so the reaction can conserve momentum and energy
simultaneously.
</p>
<p>In the 1930s physicists noticed that certain nuclear reactions seemed to violate
energy and momentum conservation.Wolfgang Pauli proposed that unseen particles
carried the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; energy and momentum. They had to be neutral (there was
no missing charge), so Enrico Fermi christened them neutrinos for &ldquo;little neutral
ones.&rdquo; As we will see in Sect. 15.4, we now understand that there are different types
of neutrinos, but for the moment we focus on ones associated with electrons:
</p>
<p>Matter Antimatter
</p>
<p>Neutrino, �e $ Antineutrino, N�e
</p>
<p>Whenever a nuclear reaction involves an electron or positron, a neutrino or
antineutrino is produced as a result of the weak nuclear force.
</p>
<p>15.3.2 Masses and Binding Energies
</p>
<p>When we discuss atomic nuclei, we label them as
</p>
<p>A
ZX
</p>
<p>where X is the abbreviation for the element in the periodic table, Z is the atomic
number (the number of protons), and A is the mass number (the total number of
protons and neutrons). For example, 42He indicates helium with two protons and two
neutrons.
</p>
<p>To quantify the energetics of fusion, we define the binding energy to be the
difference between the actual mass of a nucleus (mnuc) and the combined mass that
all the constituent protons and neutrons would have if they were isolated:
</p>
<p>Eb D
�
</p>
<p>Zmp C .A�Z/mn �mnuc
�
</p>
<p>c2 (15.12)
</p>
<p>This is the amount of energy that would be released if the nucleus were built from
scratch in one step (although nuclei are not actually made that way, as we will see).
To compare different nuclei, it can be valuable to consider the binding energy per
nucleon,Eb=A. Here are the nuclear masses and binding energies of some low-mass
isotopes, along with electrons and neutrons for comparison [6]7:
</p>
<p>7These are the masses of bare nuclei, not neutral atoms. Recall that we are considering reactions
between nuclei in ionized gas.</p>

<p>Notice that helium-4 has a higher binding energy per nucleon than other nearby
nuclei. Moving up the periodic table, Fig. 15.3 shows that carbon-12 and oxygen-16
also have higher binding energies per nucleon than adjacent nuclei. That fact makes
helium-4, carbon-12, and oxygen-16 unusually stable, which in turn makes them
important players in the fusion reactions inside stars, and among the most abundant
nuclei in the universe (after hydrogen).
</p>
<p>15.3.3 Burning Hydrogen Into Helium
</p>
<p>The reaction that powers stars for most of their lives8 is the fusion of four hydrogen
nuclei into helium-4. From theory and experiment, the overall reaction is
</p>
<p>8In Chap. 16 we will examine reactions that occur in the late stages of stellar evolution.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.3 Nuclear Reactions in Stars 313
</p>
<p>4 11H ! 42HeC 2eC C 2�e C 2&#13; (15.13)
</p>
<p>This does not happen in one step, though. In fact, several sequences of reactions
have this net effect.
</p>
<p>Proton-Proton (PP) Chain
</p>
<p>One sequence of reactions is called the proton-proton chain. There are actually
several variants of this chain. The first, called PP I, begins with:
</p>
<p>1
1HC 11H ! 21HC eC C �e (15.14)
2
1HC 11H ! 32HeC &#13; (15.15)
</p>
<p>After this pair of reactions occurs twice, there are two helium-3 nuclei that can
fuse via
</p>
<p>3
2HeC 32He ! 42HeC 2 11H
</p>
<p>The first pair of steps uses three hydrogen nuclei; they must occur twice, consuming
a total of six hydrogens. The final step produces two new hydrogens, though, so the
net effect is that four hydrogens are consumed to create one helium-4 nucleus.
</p>
<p>Note that the first reaction requires one proton to be converted into a neutron,9
</p>
<p>p ! nC eC C �e
</p>
<p>There is something odd here: the neutron weighs more than the proton, so the
right-hand side has more mass/energy (940.076MeV, plus the neutrino energy) than
the left-hand side (938.272MeV). In other words, at least 1.8MeV of energy is
absorbed by this reaction. That is okay, though, because the fusion of a proton and
neutron into deuterium (21H) releases more than enough energy to compensate.
</p>
<p>Once some helium-4 exists,10 there is a chance that the helium-3 produced in the
second step above will react with helium-4,
</p>
<p>3
2HeC 42He ! 74BeC &#13;
</p>
<p>After this, there are two possibilities. One branch called PP II involves:
</p>
<p>7
4BeC e� ! 73LiC �e (15.16)
7
3LiC 11H ! 2 42He
</p>
<p>9This is a form of beta decay, which is different from hypothetical spontaneous proton decay.
10Helium-4 is produced in the big bang (see Chap. 20), so it can be present in stars even before PP
I occurs.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>314 15 Nuclear Fusion
</p>
<p>The alternative called PP III has:
</p>
<p>7
4BeC 11H ! 85BC &#13;
</p>
<p>8
5B ! 84BeC eC C �e (15.17)
8
4Be ! 2 42He
</p>
<p>In principle, helium-3 can go straight to helium-4 through the reaction
</p>
<p>3
2HeC 11H ! 42HeC eC C �e (15.18)
</p>
<p>This is known as PP IV, or HeP because it combines helium (He) with a proton (P).
It has not actually been identified in the Sun because the predicted rate is too low.
</p>
<p>In addition to Eq. (15.14), there is an alternate way to produce deuterium, which
is known as PEP because it involves an electron in addition to two protons:
</p>
<p>1
1HC e� C 11H ! 21HC �e (15.19)
</p>
<p>This step replaces Eq. (15.14) in about 1/400 of the reactions in the Sun.
Overall, 87.6% of the reactions in the Sun follow the PP I branch, 10.7% follow
</p>
<p>the PP II branch, and 0.9% follow the PP III branch. (Only 0.8% of reactions follow
the alternate sequence known as the CNO cycle.) [7]
</p>
<p>CNO Cycle
</p>
<p>Another sequence of reactions for converting hydrogen into helium uses carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen as catalysts, and hence is called the CNO cycle. The main
branch looks like this (CNO I):
</p>
<p>12
6 CC 11H ! 137 NC &#13;
</p>
<p>13
7 N ! 136 CC eC C �e (15.20)
</p>
<p>13
6 CC 11H ! 147 NC &#13;
14
7 NC 11H ! 158 OC &#13;
</p>
<p>15
8 O ! 157 NC eC C �e (15.21)
</p>
<p>15
7 NC 11H ! 126 CC 42He
</p>
<p>This representation makes it look like carbon-12 is the start- and end-point, but the
sequence is in fact a cycle that can be entered at any point. While various forms of
carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are created and consumed in the cycle, the net effect
is the conversion of four hydrogens into one helium-4.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.4 Solar Neutrinos 315
</p>
<p>An alternative branch (CNO II) replaces the 157 N step above with a different
series of reactions:
</p>
<p>15
7 NC 11H ! 168 OC &#13;
16
8 OC 11H ! 179 FC &#13;
</p>
<p>17
9 F ! 178 OC eC C �e (15.22)
</p>
<p>17
8 OC 11H ! 147 NC 42He
14
7 NC 11H ! 158 OC &#13;
</p>
<p>15
8 O ! 157 NC eC C �e (15.23)
</p>
<p>Notice that this branch does not replace the initial carbon. However, this branch is
rare (0.04%), so the overall carbon destruction rate is small. There are yet other
branches of the CNO cycle that occur only in massive stars.
</p>
<p>PP or CNO?
</p>
<p>Which chain actually powers stars? As you can compute in Problem 15.5, the CNO
cycle has a much stronger temperature dependence than the PP chain. The PP chain
therefore dominates at low temperatures while the CNO cycle takes over at high
temperatures (see Fig. 15.4). The transition temperature corresponds to the core of a
main sequence star with a mass of about 1:2Mˇ. Along the main sequence, in other
words, stars with M . 1:2Mˇ are mainly powered by the PP chain, while stars
withM &amp; 1:2Mˇ are mainly powered by the CNO cycle.
</p>
<p>15.4 Solar Neutrinos
</p>
<p>For the most part, we can test the theory of fusion only by building it into stellar
models (see Sect. 16.2) and seeing how well the models reproduce properties of
stars such as mass, size, and luminosity. With the Sun, however, we have access to
the fusion reactions through the neutrinos they produce. These particles interact so
weakly that they stream right out of the Sun. Most of them stream through Earth,
too, but the few that are caught prove to be very informative.
</p>
<p>15.4.1 Neutrino Production in the Sun
</p>
<p>John Bahcall and collaborators [8] used a detailed model of the Sun (known as
the Standard Solar Model; see Sect. 16.2.2) to predict the rate at which neutrinos</p>

<p>are produced. Neutrinos hardly notice the matter in the Sun (see Problem 15.7), so
the spectrum of neutrino energies at Earth should reflect the intrinsic distribution
of energies in the core of the Sun. Figure 15.5 shows that the spectrum for each
reaction has a cutoff set by the masses involved in the reaction (see Problem 15.8).
This is important because, as we will see, it is easiest to detect neutrinos whose
energies are above a few MeV. Most of the solar neutrinos that we detect therefore
come from the boron decay reaction in the PP III branch. The boron reaction may
be rare in the Sun, but it plays a major role in our understanding of stellar physics.
</p>
<p>15.4.2 Neutrino Detection (I)
</p>
<p>Figure 15.5 suggests that there are enormous numbers of neutrinos passing through
Earth. How can we detect them? One reaction that can be used to &ldquo;capture&rdquo; a
neutrino is
</p>
<p>37
17ClC �e ! 3718ArC e� (15.24)
</p>
<p>This reaction involves the isotope chlorine-37, which constitutes about 25% of
natural chlorine. In the 1960s, Ray Davis assembled about 600 tons of tetra-
chlorethylene (cleaning fluid) to serve as the world&rsquo;s first neutrino detector. (See
[9] for a contemporaneous article.) The idea was to let the tank sit for a few weeks,</p>

<p>then collect the argon atoms that were produced when chlorine-37 atoms captured
neutrinos. It seems quite remarkable that Davis and his team were able to separate
a few dozen argon atoms from �1030 chlorine atoms!
</p>
<p>The experiment took place nearly 1.5 km underground, in the Homestake Gold
Mine in South Dakota. It was located in a mine so the overlying rock could act as
a natural shield against stray particles that might produce argon. Neutrinos pass
through rock with ease (in fact, the Homestake experiment collected neutrinos
during both day and night, because neutrinos could travel the long way through
Earth and enter the bottom of the tank at night), but most other particles are stopped.
</p>
<p>Homestake did detect neutrinos from the Sun, confirming our basic picture of
fusion in the Sun&rsquo;s core. For this pioneering work, Davis shared the 2002 Nobel
Prize in Physics. However, the measured flux of neutrinos was only about 30% of
the flux predicted by the Standard Solar Model. The discrepancy between theory
and observations became known as the solar neutrino problem.

the Sun was wrong, or neutrino physics was richer than anticipated. The second</p>

<p>possibility was intriguing because the reactions that produce neutrinos in the Sun
and the chlorine reactions used to capture neutrinos at Homestake all involve
electrons or anti-electrons. According to particle physics, neutrinos associated with
electrons are not the only kind that exist. The electron has two sister particles, known
as the muon and the tau particle, and they have their own related neutrinos:

leptons, and the three different classes are known as flavors.
</p>
<p>The particle physics became relevant for astrophysics because theorists specu-
lated that neutrinos might be able to oscillate between flavor states [10]. If so, then
electron neutrinos produced in the Sun might transform to mu or tau neutrinos on
the way to Earth, thereby becoming invisible to experiments like Homestake and
causing the observed neutrino flux to be lower than expected. Such changes could
occur only if the three types of neutrinos have different masses, but at the time it
was not known whether they have any mass at all. The possibility that neutrino
oscillations might solve the solar neutrino problem&mdash;and, conversely, that solar
neutrinos might reveal new physics&mdash;inspired a new generation of experiments to
detect other flavors of neutrinos and constrain their masses.
</p>
<p>The oscillation process is modified slightly when neutrinos propagate through
matter, because the presence of electrons changes the effective mass states. This
process, known as the MSW effect after Mikheyev and Smirnov [11] and Wolfen-
stein [12], can affect neutrinos as they leave the Sun and also as they travel through
Earth.
</p>
<p>15.4.4 Neutrino Detection (II)
</p>
<p>In order to test the hypothesis that neutrino oscillations solve the solar neutrino
problem, new detectors needed to be sensitive not only to electron neutrinos but
also to the mu and tau flavors. The two experiments that played the most significant
roles were Super-Kamiokande in Japan and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in
Canada.
</p>
<p>Super-Kamiokande
</p>
<p>Super-Kamiokande detects neutrinos when they scatter off electrons in 50,000 tons
of water. (There is nothing particularly special about water; it is just a convenient</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.4 Solar Neutrinos 319
</p>
<p>medium that is translucent and feasible to obtain and purify in large quantities.)
Formally, the interaction can be written as
</p>
<p>�x C e� ! �x C e�
</p>
<p>where �x refers to any flavor of neutrino. In detail, electron neutrinos have a
higher electron scattering cross section than mu or tau neutrinos, but the difference
is known and can be factored into data analysis. Super-Kamiokande focuses on
neutrinoswith energies above 5MeV in order to discriminate them from background
effects. When such an energetic neutrino scatters, it transfers some of its energy to
an electron, causing the electron to reach a speed very close to c that can actually be
faster than light moves in water.11 A faster-than-light electron emits a flash of blue
light called Čerenkov radiation that can be detected with photomultiplier tubes
lining the tank.
</p>
<p>Electron scattering does not directly distinguish neutrino flavors, but it still offers
ways to look for evidence of oscillations. There may be a daily modulation in
the solar neutrino flux: during daytime solar neutrinos come down from above,
but at night they must travel through Earth before reaching the detector, which
subjects them to the MSW effect. There may also be an annual modulation:
as Earth&rsquo;s distance from the Sun varies, there is not only a 1=r2 change in flux
(which can be accounted for) but also a small change in oscillations because of
the varying propagation distance. Super-Kamiokande has analyzed these variations,
in conjunction with the total flux and energy spectrum, to constrain neutrino
oscillations and provide evidence that the neutrino flux at Earth is in fact consistent
with predictions from the Standard Solar Model. (See [13] for a discussion of the
methodology and initial results, and [14] for more recent results.)
</p>
<p>Super-Kamiokande has also been used to study neutrinos that are produced
when cosmic rays strike Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere [15], as well as neutrinos in artificial
beams produced at accelerators [16]. The various studies are designed to understand
different aspects of neutrino oscillations and implications for neutrino masses.
</p>
<p>Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
</p>
<p>Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) was designed not only to detect but also to
distinguish between electron, mu, and tau neutrinos. It used 1,000 tons of heavy
water (D2O) in order to be sensitive to three different processes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electron scattering (ES), as in Super-Kamiokande.
&bull; Charged current reaction (CC). An electron neutrino can split a deuterium
</p>
<p>nucleus into a proton and neutron, and then convert the neutron into a proton
and electron:
</p>
<p>11The speed of light in a water is c=n where n � 1:3 is the index of refraction at visible
wavelengths. Electrons can travel faster than light in water without violating the relativistic speed
limit v &lt; c.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>320 15 Nuclear Fusion
</p>
<p>�e C 21H ! 11HC 11HC e�
</p>
<p>(This is the inverse of step (15.14) in the PP chain.) Electrons produced in this
reaction can also emit Čerenkov radiation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Neutral current reaction (NC). Any flavor of neutrino can split a deuterium
nucleus without transforming the neutron:
</p>
<p>�x C 21H ! 11HC nC �x
</p>
<p>The neutron can then be captured by another nucleus in a reaction that emits
an energetic gamma ray. The gamma ray photon then scatters off an electron,
accelerating the electron to the point that it can emit Čerenkov radiation.
</p>
<p>Like Super-Kamiokande, SNO had a neutrino energy threshold of 5MeV, so it was
mainly sensitive to neutrinos from boron decay.
</p>
<p>In the initial experiment, the three channels led to the following neutrino fluxes
(in units of 106 cm�2 s�1) [17]:
</p>
<p>CC: �CC D 1:76C0:06�0:05(stat.)C0:09�0:09(syst.)
ES: �ES D 2:39C0:24�0:23(stat.)C0:12�0:12(syst.)
NC: �NC D 5:09C0:44�0:43(stat.)C0:46�0:43(syst.)
</p>
<p>where the two sets of errorbars represent statistical and systematic uncertainties. The
fact that the NC flux was higher than the CC and ES fluxes immediately revealed that
some of the neutrinos from the Sun are being detected as mu and/or tau neutrinos,
i.e., that neutrino oscillation does occur. Decomposing the three channel fluxes into
contributions from electron neutrinos or mu/tau neutrinos (combined) yielded
</p>
<p>�e D 1:76C0:05�0:05(stat.)C0:09�0:09(syst.)
��� D 3:41C0:45�0:45(stat.)C0:48�0:45(syst.)
</p>
<p>There were two key conclusions. First, the total flux of neutrinos agreed with
predictions from the Standard Solar Model (5:05 in these units [18]). Second, only
about 34% of the detections involved electron neutrinos. Apparently the original
solar neutrino problem arose not because the predictions were incorrect but because
the Homestake experiment was unable to detect 2/3 of the solar neutrinos that pass
through Earth.
</p>
<p>In a second phase of the experiment, SNO added two tons of salt (NaCl) to the
heavy water to enhance the sensitivity to NC reactions. (Chlorine is a good target
for capturing neutrons released when deuterium is split; there were other technical
gains as well.) This experiment yielded neutrino fluxes of [19]
</p>
<p>CC: �CC D 1:68C0:06�0:06(stat.)C0:08�0:09(syst.)</p>

NC: �NC D 4:94C0:21�0:21(stat.)C0:38�0:34(syst.)
</p>
<p>In a third phase, SNO introduced an independent way to detect the NC neutrons by
having them captured in helium-3 nuclei. This experiment yielded fluxes of [20]
</p>
<p>CC: �CC D 1:67C0:05�0:04(stat.)C0:07�0:08(syst.)

NC: �NC D 5:54C0:33�0:31(stat.)C036�0:34(syst.)
</p>
<p>Clearly the neutrino flux measurements are reproducible and robust to different
methodologies.
</p>
<p>The bottom line is that SNO solved the solar neutrino problem by demonstrating
that neutrino oscillation is real andmeasuring a (total) neutrino flux that is consistent
with predictions from the Standard Solar Model. The agreement between theory and
experiment indicates that we understand quite a lot about what is happening deep
inside the Sun. The little neutral ones have proven to be both harbingers of new
particle physics and important messengers from the center of our star.

<p>Problems
</p>
<p>15.1. Does the fusion of heavy nuclei require higher or lower temperatures than the
fusion of light nuclei? Why?

</p>
<p>If everything else were the same, would the Sun&rsquo;s lifetime be longer or shorter? By
how much?
</p>
<p>15.3. Show that the function

peak (i.e., a local maximum, not a local minimum).
</p>
<p>15.4. The goal of this problem is to understand how the fusion reaction rate depends
on temperature. In Eq. (15.8) we showed that the reaction rate can be written as</p>

<p>Our task is to estimate the remaining integral. Here are the steps to do that.
</p>
<p>(a) Expand the function f .E/ as a Taylor series around the Gamow peak,E D E0.
This means you can approximate f with the form

<p>f .E/ � b0 C b1.E �E0/C b2.E � E0/2 C : : :
</p>
<p>What you need to do is determine the coefficients b0, b1, and b2. Hint: you
should find b1 D 0 since E0 is a local maximum of f .E/.
</p>
<p>(b) Using part (a) and setting x D E � E0 converts the integral into a Gaussian
form that can be evaluated using expressions in Sect. A.7.12 Use this with your
values of b0 and b2 to write an approximation for r12.
</p>
<p>(c) Following Sect. 15.2.4, write the temperature dependence with a power law
approximation r12 / T ˛ and show that ˛ is given by Eq. (15.11).
</p>
<p>15.5. Let&rsquo;s compute the temperature dependence of the reaction rate for two
specific examples. Even if you have not worked through Problem 15.4, you can
still use Eq. (15.11) here. Take the temperature to be T D 1:6 � 107K.
(a) PP chain: Consider the 11HC 11H step and compute kT , Ec , E0, and ˛.
(b) CNO cycle: Consider the 147 NC 11H step and compute kT , Ec , E0, and ˛.
15.6. A brown dwarf is a star that is not massive enough to have normal hydrogen
fusion (see Problem 16.5).
</p>
<p>(a) A brown dwarf can release energy by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism.
Suppose a brown dwarf of mass M and radius R is shrinking at a rate dR=dt .
What is its luminosity? (As always, state any assumptions you make.)
</p>
<p>(b) Consider a brown dwarf with M D 0:05Mˇ and R D 0:1Rˇ, whose radius
shrinks by 1% over 109 yr. What is its luminosity (in units of Lˇ)? If it radiates
like a blackbody, what is its effective temperature? In what portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum does it emit most of its light?
</p>
<p>12Section A.7 gives integrals of Gaussian functions over the range �1 &lt; x &lt; 1. The limits of
integration in this problem are far enough from the peak that we can extend them to˙1.</p>

<p>(c) Brown dwarfs can fuse deuterium13 via the reaction 21H C 11H ! 32He. If a
fraction f D 4 � 10�5 of a brown dwarf&rsquo;s mass is deuterium, how long
could deuterium burning power the star at the same luminosity you estimated in
part (b)?

<p>Stellar Structure and Evolution
</p>
<p>In previous chapters we examined physical processes that occur near a star&rsquo;s surface
(atomic excitation, ionization, absorption) and in the interior (nuclear fusion). Now
we unite them in detailed models of stars. We use the models to analyze the
structure of stars during the main stage of life when they burn hydrogen to generate
the heat and pressure that balance gravity. We then consider what happens when
the hydrogen fuel runs out. As we will see, old stars begin burning heavier nuclei
and working their way up the periodic table of the elements. How far a star gets
depends on its mass: stars with masses below about 8Mˇ reach carbon and oxygen
before experiencing a relatively meek death; stars with masses above about 8Mˇ,
by contrast, create all the heavier elements and then literally go out with a bang.
</p>
<p>16.1 Energy Transport
</p>
<p>Before we can build stellar models, we need to think about how energy produced
in the core can be transported to the surface, to be released as light. In Chap. 13
we saw one mechanism for moving energy: with radiation, energy is carried by
light that can be absorbed by an atom or molecule and then reradiated in a different
direction. Now we consider two other mechanisms that act in dense gas. With
conduction, heat moves on microscopic scales by collisions between particles. With
convection, heat travels across macroscopic scales by bulk motion of gas. Let&rsquo;s
examine each in turn.
</p>
<p>16.1.1 Conduction
</p>
<p>Consider a box of gas (for now, one small enough that we can neglect the effects
of gravity). In equilibrium, it has the same temperature throughout. Suppose we
heat one end of the box just a little&mdash;not enough to substantially change the density

</p>
<p>and pressure, but enough to make the particles jiggle a little faster. As these faster
particles fly around, they bump into other particles in the box and transfer some
of their kinetic energy. In this way collisions can allow the extra energy (heat) to
travel across the box. Can we find an equation to describe this process, specifically
to describe how the temperature changes with time at different locations in the box?
</p>
<p>The temperature can change only if T is not spatially uniform&mdash;heat can only
&ldquo;flow&rdquo; from a hotter region to a colder region&mdash;so @T=@t must be related to some
spatial derivative of T . Can we have
</p>
<p>@T
</p>
<p>@t
/ @T
@x
</p>
<p>&lsaquo;
</p>
<p>No, by symmetry. If this were true, the sign of @T =@t would depend on whether we
heat the left end or the right end of the box. That cannot be right! What about
</p>
<p>@T
</p>

<p>ˇ
</p>
<p>ˇ
</p>
<p>&lsaquo;
</p>
<p>No again. Consider T / x2. The temperature is non-uniform so there ought to be
heat flow. But with this hypothesis we would have @T =@t D 0 at x D 0. That does
not make sense.
</p>
<p>If first derivatives do not work, what about
</p>
<p>@T
</p>
<p>@t
/ @
</p>
<p>2T
</p>
<p>@x2
&lsaquo;
</p>
<p>This makes sense physically: if we raise the temperature anywhere, @2T=@x2 will be
nonzero, and indeed it will be positive away from the source of heat. This is in fact
the right dependence, so let&rsquo;s specify the proportionality constant, �, and generalize
to three dimensions:

</p>
<p>D � r2T (16.1)
</p>
<p>This is the heat equation, and it has the general form of a diffusion equation. The
coefficient � is called the thermal diffusivity. By dimensional analysis, we must
have
</p>
<p>� D ŒL2T �1&#141; ) � � ` v � `

</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>for some characteristic length ` and velocity v, which are presumably the mean free
path and the typical particle velocity, respectively. Alternatively, we can write � in
terms of � � `=v, which is the typical time between collisions.
</p>
<p>What is the time scale &#129;tdiff for heat to diffuse over some distance &#129;L? If we
suppose that some amount of heat &#129;T moves, then we can approximate @T=@t �
&#129;T=&#129;tdiff, and we can approximate r2T � &#129;T=.&#129;L/2. Then the heat equation

meandering trajectories known as random walks.

<p>16.1.2 Convection
</p>
<p>Adding a lot of heat to the box can induce mechanical forces that generate bulk
motion in the gas. To analyze convection, we imagine taking a small bubble of gas
from height z, moving it to height z C &#129;z, and asking what will happen next (also
see [2, 3]). If the bubble will fall back to its starting point, then small changes (such
as the formation of a bubble) tend to damp out and the gas is stable. If the bubble
will continue to rise, however, then small changes can grow into larger changes and
convection can begin spontaneously.1Our goal in this section is to derive a condition
under which gas is unstable to convection.
</p>
<p>First, we need to recall some thermodynamics. Specific heat quantifies the
amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a substance. There are actually
two specific heats: one if we increase the temperature while holding the pressure
fixed, and another if we hold the volume fixed:

<p>A non-relativistic ideal gas has &#13; D 5=3 for monatomic particles and &#13; D 7=5 for
diatomic particles (such as N2, O2, etc.). A relativistic ideal gas has &#13; D 4=3.
The adiabatic index characterizes a process in which no heat flows into or out
of a system, which is a reasonable approximation for any &ldquo;slow&rdquo; thermodynamic
process. Carroll andOstlie [2] show that such a process is described by the adiabatic
equation of state,
</p>
<p>PV &#13; D constant ) P D K �&#13; (16.4)
</p>
<p>whereK is a constant.
Now consider an ideal gas whose density, temperature, and pressure vary with

<p>height. At height z the gas is described by T , P , and �, while at height zC&#129;z it has
T C&#129;T , P C&#129;P , and �C&#129;�. We can write

<p>In the lower part of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, the temperature varies roughly linearly

<p>The temperature gradient is smaller than the value required for convective insta-

not mean that convection cannot occur; it just means that convection will not begin
spontaneously.
</p>
<p>16.2 Stellar Models
</p>
<p>Now we are ready to assemble the pieces and write down a set of equations
that describe a model star. For simplicity, we assume the star is spherically
symmetric and static (time-independent), so the density, pressure, temperature, etc.
are functions only of r . Stars may not be perfectly spherical, especially if they rotate
rapidly, and they are not truly static, but during the bulk of their lives they change
slowly; so a spherical, static model is not a bad place to start.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>332 16 Stellar Structure and Evolution
</p>
<p>16.2.1 Equations of Stellar Structure
</p>
<p>The first set of equations describe how mass, luminosity, pressure, and temperature
vary with radius. The equation relating mass to density is one we have seen before:
</p>
<p>enclosed mass
dM
</p>
<p>dr
D 4�r2� (16.10)
</p>
<p>We can write an equation for luminosity that has a similar form if we define � to
be the energy generation rate per unit mass (in units of J s�1 kg�1, for example).
Then the energy output (or luminosity) from a spherical shell of radius r and
thickness dr is dL D 4�r2�� dr , so the differential equation we need is
</p>
<p>energy generation
dL
</p>
<p>dr
D 4�r2�� (16.11)
</p>
<p>The equation for pressure comes from hydrostatic equilibrium (12.13):
</p>
<p>hydrostatic equilibrium
dP
</p>
<p>dr
D �GM.r/�
</p>
<p>r2
(16.12)
</p>
<p>Finally, the equation for temperature depends on how energy is transported. In
a convective regime, the temperature gradient will match the right-hand side of
Eq. (16.9)2:
</p>
<p>convection
dT
</p>
<p>dr
D �&#13; � 1
</p>
<p>&#13;
</p>
<p>Nm
k
</p>
<p>GM.r/
</p>
<p>r2
(16.13)
</p>
<p>In a radiative regime, the temperature gradient depends on the opacity of the gas,
N� D 1=`�. If the opacity is high, light cannot transport energy very efficiently, so
heat remains trapped and the temperature gradient is large. Conversely, if the opacity
is low, light is able to move heat energy and the temperature gradient remains small.
Carroll and Ostlie [2] and Maoz [3] derive the differential equation for temperature
in a radiative regime:
</p>
<p>radiation
dT
</p>
<p>dr
D � 3
</p>
<p>16�
</p>
<p>N��
T 3
</p>
<p>L.r/
</p>
<p>4�r2
(16.14)
</p>
<p>To supplement the four differential equations, we need equations of state that
relate the pressure, energy generation rate, and opacity to the density, temperature,
and composition of the gas. These are based on the gas physics, nuclear physics,
thermodynamics, and other principles we have studied since Chap. 12. As an
illustration, let&rsquo;s consider the pressure. The net gas pressure is the sum of partial
pressures from all the constituents:
</p>
<p>2Recall from Sect. 16.1.2 that this equation applies to an ideal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium.</p>

<p>where ntot D

<p>i ni and we are assuming an ideal gas. Pressure depends fundamen-
tally on the number density of particles, but gravity depends on the mass density so
our model is expressed in terms of �. Using the average particle mass, Nm � �=ntot,
we can write pressure in terms of mass density as
</p>
<p>Pgas D
�
</p>
<p>Nm kT (16.15)
</p>
<p>As a star evolves, its mass density remains nearly unchanged,3 but its composition
varies as hydrogen gets converted to helium. Consider how this affects Nm:
&bull; Pure neutral hydrogen: Nm D mp Cme � mp
&bull; Pure neutral helium: Nm D 2mp C 2mn C 2me � 4mp
&bull; Pure ionized hydrogen: Nm D .mpnp C mene/=.np C ne/ � mp=2, where we
</p>
<p>assume np D ne for charge neutrality
(Sinceme � mp, we can neglect the mass in electrons.) Clearly Nm and Pgas depend
on the composition of the gas, which can vary throughout the star.
</p>
<p>In addition to gas pressure, there is radiation pressure from the light.
In Sect. 13.1.4 we derived the equation of state for photon pressure,

</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>K
</p>

</p>
<p>Radiation pressure is actually negligible in the Sun. We will see below that the
temperature at the center of the Sun is about T D 1:567 � 107K, so the radiation
pressure is
</p>
<p>Prad D 2:52 � 10�16 kgm�1 s�2 �
�
</p>
<p>1:567 � 107
�4 D 1:5 � 1013 kgm�1 s�2
</p>
<p>This is small compared with the gas pressure P D 2:357 � 1016 kgm�1 s�2.
Radiation pressure is subdominant in most normal stars, but it becomes increasingly
important as the mass increases and helps determine the upper limit on the mass of
normal stars (see Problem 16.6).
</p>
<p>The differential equations shown above only describe how quantities change
with r . In order to obtain a complete solution we must specify starting or ending
values. There are some natural boundary conditions for stars. At the center, as
r ! 0 there is no mass or luminosity enclosed, so we must have
</p>
<p>M.0/ D 0 L.0/ D 0
</p>
<p>3Strictly speaking, some matter gets converted to energy, but that is a small fraction of the total.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>334 16 Stellar Structure and Evolution
</p>
<p>At the surface, the mass, luminosity, and temperature should take on their overall
values for the star, and at least for simplicity we might imagine that the density and
pressure vanish:
</p>
<p>�.R/ D 0 P.R/ D 0 M.R/ DMtot L.R/ D Ltot T .R/ D Teff
</p>
<p>In reality the boundary conditions can be more complicated: stars have diffuse but
extended atmospheres, and they can lose mass (due to a &ldquo;stellar wind&rdquo;). But the
simple boundary conditions given here provide a good starting point.
</p>
<p>The equations of stellar structure represent a set of coupled differential equations
where some of the components may not even be known analytically. (Nuclear
reaction rates are often empirically calibrated.) In general they cannot be solved
by hand, but they are suitable for numerical integration as discussed in Sect. A.6.
</p>
<p>16.2.2 The Sun
</p>
<p>John Bahcall and his collaborators have used the stellar structure equations to
develop a detailed model of the Sun known as the Standard Solar Model [4]. It
predicts the following values at the center of the Sun:
</p>
<p>Density 1:529 � 105 kgm�3
Temperature 1:567 � 107 K
Pressure 2:357� 1016 kgm�1 s�2
Hydrogen mass fraction 34.61%
Helium mass fraction 63.37%
</p>
<p>The density, temperature, pressure, and composition change with radius as shown
in Fig. 16.2. The composition curves suggest that fusion occurs mainly in a core
region whose radius is 15&ndash;20% of Rˇ. As we saw in Sect. 15.4, Bahcall et al.
used the model to predict the abundance of neutrinos produced by the Sun, and
subsequent detections have provided important evidence that the Standard Solar
Model is accurate.
</p>
<p>There are other ways to test the model as well. For example, some of the curves in
Fig. 16.2 show a small &ldquo;kink&rdquo; around 0:7Rˇ. As you can show in Problem 16.3, this
corresponds to the point at which the Sun becomes convectively unstable. The idea
that the outer 30% of the Sun is convective is confirmed by granulation in the
photosphere. Hot bubbles of gas rise to the surface, spread out, cool, and sink
back down. Since the rising hot gas is brighter than the sinking cool gas (by the
Stefan-Boltzmann law, Sect. 13.1.1), convection produces a patchwork of brighter
and darker regions as shown in Fig. 16.3. Convection also causes the surface of the
Sun effectively to oscillate. As with seismology on Earth, helioseismology uses</p>

<p>16.2.3 Other Stars
</p>
<p>When the equations are applied to different kinds of stars, a pattern known as
the Vogt-Russell theorem emerges: &ldquo;The mass and the composition structure
throughout a star uniquely determine its radius, luminosity, and internal structure,
as well as its subsequent evolution.&rdquo;4 This is not a rigorous mathematical theorem
because quantities beyond mass and composition (such as magnetic fields and

</p>
<p>rotation) can in fact influence stellar structure. Nevertheless, the Vogt-Russell
theorem is a good rule of thumb that seems to describe real stars quite well.
</p>
<p>Mass is the main factor that determines star properties, because compositions
are fairly uniform at birth&mdash;mostly hydrogen and helium in a ratio that reflects
cosmic abundances (see Chap. 20), plus trace amounts of heavier elements&mdash;and
they change slowly with time. Using the models to predict the luminosity and
effective temperature as a function of mass yields a curve that follows the main
sequence in the HR diagram (see Fig. 16.4). In other words, the observed main
sequence is actually a sequence in mass, running from cool, faint, low-mass stars
in the lower right of the HR diagram to hot, luminous, massive stars in the upper
left. Physically, a more massive star needs a higher temperature and pressure to
balance the stronger gravity. Those conditions yield more fusion and thus a higher
energy output (luminosity).
</p>
<p>What sets the endpoints of the main sequence? At lower masses the internal
temperature is cooler, and at some point it is too low to support fusion. This
is the bottom end of the main sequence&mdash;the lowest mass object we call a star.
Models indicate that the fusion limit occurs around 0:08Mˇ. At the top end, above
�100Mˇ the fusion is so intense that radiation pressure makes the core unstable.
(You can estimate these limits in Problems 16.5 and 16.6.)
</p>
<p>There are a couple of points at low masses that are worth noting. In Sect. 15.3.3
we remarked that fusion in stars with M . 1:2Mˇ mainly follows the PP
chain, whereas fusion in more massive stars mainly follows the CNO cycle. For
CNO-driven stars, the fusion rate depends strongly on temperature and hence radius.
Radiation cannot transport energy rapidly enough, so a large temperature gradient
builds up and induces convection. As a result, stars with M &amp; 1:2Mˇ have
convective cores. For PP-driven stars, by contrast, the fusion rate varies less strongly
with temperature and hence radius, so radiation is sufficient to transport energy and</p>

<p>there is no convection in the core. Radiation becomes inefficient near the surface,
though, because the lower temperature leads to less ionization and excitation and
hence greater opacity. As a result, stars with M . 1:2Mˇ have convection in
the outer layers. As the mass decreases, the bottom of the convection zone moves
progressively downwards until at�0:4Mˇ it reaches the core and the star becomes
fully convective (e.g., [6]).

</p>
<p>16.3 Evolution of Low-Mass Stars (M . 8Mˇ)
</p>
<p>Stars are not truly static; they evolve as fusion modifies the internal composition and
hence the equations of state. Stellar models can be extended to track the evolution
and predict how stars move through the HR diagram once they leave the main
sequence. Figure 16.4 shows examples of evolutionary tracks for a few different
masses. In this section we consider the main stages in the life of a star whose mass
is less than �8Mˇ.5
</p>
<p>16.3.1 Hydrogen, Helium, and Beyond
</p>
<p>During most of a star&rsquo;s life it generates power by burning hydrogen to produce
helium. Once a star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it can burn helium to produce heavier
elements. It turns out that the hydrogen and helium burning phases can each be
divided into two sub-stages depending on where within the star the fusion occurs.
</p>
<p>Hydrogen core burning. Stars that burn hydrogen in their cores lie on the main
sequence in the HR diagram. Even during this stage there are some notable changes.
As a star converts hydrogen into helium, its internal composition changes even
if its surface composition (which determines its spectral type) does not. Recall
from Eq. (16.15) that the pressure of a gas depends on the composition through
the average particle mass, Nm (assuming the mass density is constant). As hydrogen
changes to helium, Nm increases. In order to maintain the same pressure (to balance
gravity), the temperature must likewise increase. That causes the fusion rate to
increase, which in turn raises the star&rsquo;s luminosity. The net effect is that stars
brighten a little as they age (by a factor of �2 for the Sun [8]), so they have a
small vertical movement in the HR diagram. This contributes to the thickness of the
main sequence.
</p>
<p>Hydrogen shell burning. Once the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, the star has a
helium core surrounded by an envelope of hydrogen. The temperature and pressure
can be high enough to ignite hydrogen fusion in a shell around the helium core.
The temperature in the shell is actually higher than it was during the earlier stage
of hydrogen core burning, so the energy production rate and luminosity are higher.
Some of the energy goes into making the outer envelope expand, which causes the
surface to cool and become redder. The star becomes luminous, large, and cool&mdash;a
red giant. As the star continues to age, it moves up the red giant branch in the HR
diagram.
</p>
<p>Helium core burning. Once enough helium accumulates to cross a threshold in
mass, the helium core begins to collapse due to its gravity. At some point the central

<p>16.3 Evolution of Low-Mass Stars (M . 8Mˇ) 339
</p>
<p>temperature (T � 108K) and density (� � 107 kgm�3) become high enough to
initiate fusion that converts three helium nuclei into carbon:
</p>
<p>4
2HeC 42He &bull; 84Be
8
4BeC 42He ! 126 C
</p>
<p>Helium-4 nuclei are known as &ldquo;alpha particles,&rdquo; so this set of reactions is called
the triple alpha process. Beryllium-8 can spontaneously decay (hence the reverse
arrow above), so it needs to react quickly with another helium-4 nucleus to form
carbon-12. Thus, the triple alpha process can proceed only if the temperature and
density are high enough to achieve a sufficient reaction rate. Once some carbon
exists, it can combine with more helium to form oxygen:
</p>
<p>12
6 CC 42He ! 168 O
</p>
<p>With these new energy sources, the core is able to expand a little, which lowers the
core temperature and reduces the luminosity. That, in turn, allows the envelope to
shrink, causing the surface temperature to rise. Once helium ignites, in other words,
the star shifts down and to the left in the HR diagram, moving onto the horizontal
branch.
</p>
<p>Helium shell burning. Once helium in the core is used up, the process above
repeats itself, only at higher temperatures. Now the star burns hydrogen in an outer
shell and helium in an inner shell, all surrounding a carbon/oxygen core. Such a star
lies on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) in the HR diagram.
</p>
<p>AGB stars are large and have cool envelopes (T � 3;000K) that contain carbon
and oxygen dredged up from the core by convection. The conditions are right to
generate dust that is rich in silicates and/or graphite. Such dust will eventually return
to the interstellar medium, where it can be detected by the way it scatters light.
</p>
<p>The energy production rate in AGB stars is high enough to drive a stellar wind
that carries away some of the mass. Themass loss can be dM=dt � �10�4Mˇ yr�1,
which may not seem like a lot but is enough that a star could lose most of its mass
in as little as 10,000 years.
</p>
<p>Planetary nebula. Eventually the entire outer envelope is expelled to form an
expanding gas cloud known as a planetary nebula. (These have nothing to do with
planets; they got the name because in early telescopes they appeared as circular
disks and thus resembled images of nearby planets.) The planetary nebula expands
at a rate of 10&ndash;30 km/s, so after 10,000&ndash;50,000 years it will be so large and diffuse
that it will have dispersed into the interstellar medium.
</p>
<p>White dwarf. The remnants of the carbon/oxygen core settle into a hot, dense
object known as a white dwarf. The gas has changed from an ideal gas in which
the pressure is produced by motion of the gas particles to a &ldquo;degenerate&rdquo; gas in
which the pressure arises from a quantum mechanical effect that prevents particles</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>340 16 Stellar Structure and Evolution
</p>
<p>from being in the same quantum state. We will study a gas supported by electron
degeneracy pressure in Chap. 17. White dwarfs cool slowly, and they can be around
for a long time.
</p>
<p>To recap, here are the stages in the life of a low-mass star, the corresponding
parts of the HR diagram, and the approximate duration of each stage (for a solar
mass star [7, 9]):
</p>
<p>Hydrogen core burning Main sequence 1010 yr
Hydrogen shell burning Red giant branch 109 yr
Helium core burning Horizontal branch 108 yr
Helium shell burning Asymptotic giant branch 107 yr
Mass loss Planetary nebula 104 yr
Electron degeneracy White dwarf
</p>
<p>Again, this evolutionary process creates elements up through carbon and oxygen.
</p>
<p>16.3.2 Observations
</p>
<p>We cannot observe all the stages of evolution for any single star; even the &ldquo;short&rdquo;
stages are longer than a human lifetime. Nevertheless, it is possible to see the
whole evolutionary pathway. The key idea is that all stars withM . 8Mˇ follow
the same set of steps, but at different rates. More massive stars pass through the
sequence more quickly than less massive stars (they have more fuel but burn it
faster).
</p>
<p>Consider a set of stars with different masses that all formed at the same time.
After a few billion years, the more massive stars will have progressed through the
evolutionary sequence to reach, say, the asymptotic giant branch. Stars that are a
little less massive will have reached the horizontal branch. Still smaller stars will be
on the red giant branch. The lowest mass stars will remain on the main sequence.
At a snapshot in time, the stars will trace out the full evolutionary track in the HR
diagram (with position along the track determined by mass).
</p>
<p>The universe kindly provides exactly what we need to see this. Star clusters
are collections of stars that formed at approximately the same time (when a gas
cloud collapsed and fragmented; see Chap. 19). Figure 16.5 shows HR diagrams for
two observed star clusters. Stellar evolution theory can be used to predict curves
showing the positions of stars that have different masses but the same age, known as
isochrones (from iso= sam+ chrone= time). Matching an isochrone to the observed
HR diagram makes it possible to determine the age of a star cluster.
</p>
<p>A particularly important point in the HR diagram of a cluster is the main
sequence turn-off (MSTO). Less massive stars have longer main sequence life-
times than more massive stars, so as time passes the turn-off point moves down
the main sequence. Matching observed MSTO points with theoretical predictions</p>

<p>reveals how much time has passed since the cluster formed&mdash;the age of the cluster.
Such &ldquo;age dating&rdquo; has revealed that the oldest known star clusters are around
11.5Gyr old [10], whereas the universe is about 13.8Gyr old [11]. (The two clusters
shown in Fig. 16.5 are relatively young.)
</p>
<p>16.4 Evolution of High-Mass Stars (M &amp; 8Mˇ)
</p>
<p>High-mass stars also go through stages of core H burning, shell H burning, core He
burning, and shell He burning. What makes them different from low-mass stars is
that they do not stop at helium. The higher mass leads to higher temperatures and
densities that can drive fusion further up the periodic table of the elements.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>342 16 Stellar Structure and Evolution
</p>
<p>16.4.1 Beyond Carbon and Oxygen
</p>
<p>After helium burning produces carbon and oxygen, the temperature in a high-mass
star remains high enough (T &amp; 108K) that carbon and oxygen can burn by reacting
with helium:
</p>
<p>12
6 CC 42He ! 168 OC &#13;
16
8 OC 42He ! 2010NeC &#13;
</p>
<p>As the temperature increases still further, carbon and oxygen can burn in new ways,
producing a whole range of byproducts. Above 6 � 108K, carbon/carbon reactions
become possible:
</p>
<p>12
6 CC 126 C ! 168 OC 2 42He
</p>
<p>! 2010NeC 42He
! 2311NaC p
! 2312MgC n
! 2412MgC &#13;
</p>
<p>Above 109K, oxygen/oxygen reactions begin:
</p>
<p>16
8 OC 168 O ! 2412MgC 2 42He
</p>
<p>! 2814SiC 42He
! 3115PC p
! 3116SC n
! 3216SC &#13;
</p>
<p>And above 3 � 109K, even heavier elements can burn:
</p>
<p>28
14SiC 42He &bull; 3216SC &#13;
32
16SC 42He &bull; 3618ArC &#13;

52
26FeC 42He &bull; 5628NiC &#13;
</p>
<p>These reactions are known collectively as silicon burning.
Where does the process stop? As fusion creates heavier and heavier nuclei, it
</p>
<p>releases less and less energy because the available binding energy decreases (see
Fig. 16.6). The burning must go faster and faster in order to supply the energy the</p>

<p>star needs to avoid collapsing. Here are the durations of the various stages for a
25Mˇ star [3]:
</p>
<p>Core hydrogen burning 5� 106 yr
Core helium burning 5� 105 yr
Core carbon burning 500 yr
Core silicon burning 1 day
</p>
<p>Once silicon burning produces nickel-56, the core has crossed the peak in the
binding energy curve. At that point there is nomore energy to be released by fusion.6
</p>
<p>When the star loses its ability to create energy, things get really wild.
</p>
<p>16.4.2 Explosion: Supernova
</p>
<p>By the time the star is burning silicon, the temperature is so high that photons
possess enough energy to destroy heavy nuclei; this process is called photodis-
integration (and it is why the silicon burning reactions above have reverse arrows).
Two reactions that absorb energy from the star are:
</p>
<p>56
26FeC &#13; ! 13 42HeC 4 n
</p>
<p>6A little energy is available from radioactive decay of nickel-56 into cobalt-56 and then into iron-
56, but it is not enough to support the star.</p>

2HeC &#13; ! 2 p C 2 n
</p>
<p>Another significant reaction is inverse beta decay,
</p>
<p>p C e� ! nC �e
</p>
<p>Essentially, the pressure is high enough to squeeze protons and electrons together
to form neutrons and neutrinos. This process is important for two reasons. First,
the neutrinos carry away huge amounts of energy. Second, electrons that had
been helping to support the core (via electron degeneracy pressure) are removed.
When they disappear, the core quickly collapses. How quickly? In Problem 16.9
you can derive the freefall time for a sphere of density � to collapse under its own
gravity:

</p>
<p>The degenerate core of a massive star can be comparable to the mass of our Sun.
In Sect. 1.3.2 we used dimensional analysis to estimate that an object of mass
M �Mˇ supported by electron degeneracy pressure has a radius ofR � 6�106m.
Thus the mean density is

<p>With no pressure support, it takes a core that is the mass of the Sun and the size of
Earth only about a second to collapse.
</p>
<p>Once the core shrinks to a size of �10 km, the density is comparable to that of
an atomic nucleus. The gas develops neutron degeneracy pressure that prevents
the core from collapsing further. (This is an example of a relativistic degenerate gas,
which we will study in Sect. 17.1.) The collapse releases a tremendous amount of
gravitational potential energy, going from

In the middle and right panels, the crosshairs mark different supernovae that were observed in
2005 and 2011, respectively (Image c&#13; 2011 R. Jay GaBany, Cosmotography.com, reproduced by

</p>
<p>Something in the ballpark of 1046 J of gravitational energy is released. Most of it is
carried by the neutrinos produced when the protons and electrons combined to form
neutrons. Only a fraction of the energy goes into kinetic energy, but it is enough to
create a shock wave that blows apart the gaseous envelope of the star. The result is
an enormous stellar explosion called a type II (core collapse) supernova.7 An even
smaller fraction of the energy goes into photons&mdash;but that is still a lot of light energy.
At peak brightness a supernova can have a luminosity of around 109Lˇ, so it stands
out even against the background galaxy (see Fig. 16.7). Overall, the rough energy
budget for the explosion is as follows [3]:
</p>
<p>Neutrinos �1046 J
Kinetic energy �1044 J
Photons �1042 J
</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, a typical massive star-forming galaxy has about one
supernova per century. In the Milky Way, a type II supernova observed in 1054
left a remnant known as the Crab Nebula (Fig. 16.8).8 Another one seen in 1987
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way) has provided
a wealth of information about core collapse supernovae. In particular, Supernova
</p>
<p>7There is another class of supernova, called type Ia, that occurs when a white dwarf crosses a
threshold in mass known as the Chandrasekhar limit (see Sect. 17.2.2). These are the supernovae
that are used to study the expansion of the universe (see Chap. 18).
8In addition, there were supernovae that were probably type Ia seen in the years 1006, 1572
(&ldquo;Tycho&rsquo;s supernova&rdquo;), and 1604 (&ldquo;Kepler&rsquo;s supernova&rdquo;).</p>

</p>
<p>1987A was close enough (cosmically speaking) that three neutrino detectors on
Earth were able to record a total of 24 neutrinos from the explosion. While that may
not seem like a large number, it was consistent with predictions given the distance
to the supernova and the small cross section for neutrino interaction. This marked
the first direct confirmation that neutrinos are produced in copious amounts as part
of a core collapse event.
</p>
<p>16.4.3 Beyond Iron
</p>
<p>Where do elements heavier than iron come from? There are two sets of reactions
that do not produce energy but can occur when neutrons are abundant. The first is
neutron capture:
</p>
<p>A
ZXC n ! AC1Z XC &#13;
</p>
<p>The second is beta decay, which turns a neutron within a nucleus into a proton and
a free electron:
</p>
<p>AC1
Z X ! AC1ZC1XC e� C N�e C &#13;
</p>
<p>There are two cases:
</p>
<p>&bull; If beta decay is more rapid than neutron capture, then heavy elements build up
&ldquo;slowly.&rdquo; This s-process tends to create stable nuclei.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Problems 347
</p>
<p>&bull; If neutrons are captured more rapidly than beta decay can eliminate them, then
heavy, neutron-rich elements build up &ldquo;rapidly.&rdquo; This is the r-process.
</p>
<p>With all of this as background, we can now understand where all of the elements in
the universe come from:
</p>
<p>Hydrogen, helium, lithium Big bang (see Chap. 20)
Beryllium through carbon and oxygen Low- and high-mass stars
All heavier elements High-mass stars
</p>
<p>Nuclear processes in dying stars is responsible for all elements in the universe
heavier than hydrogen, helium, and lithium.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>16.1. Throughout most of the Sun the gas is fully ionized. In this problem, you
may ignore elements heavier than helium, but remember to account for the free
electrons.
</p>
<p>(a) In intermediate layers of the Sun (r � 0:5Rˇ), there are about 86 helium nuclei
for every 1,000 hydrogen nuclei. What is the average particle mass Nm in this
region, in units of the proton mass mp?
</p>
<p>(b) In the core of the Sun, the average particle mass approaches 0:84mp. For every
1,000 hydrogen nuclei in the Sun&rsquo;s core, how many helium nuclei are there?
</p>
<p>16.2. How long does it take a photon to escape from the center of the Sun? A photon
has to random walk its way out because it scatters off free electrons with cross
section �T D .8�e4/=.3m2ec4/ D 6:65 � 10�29m2 (the Thomson cross section).
Make a rough estimate of the travel time using the average density of the Sun. (See
[13] and references therein for a more detailed treatment.)
</p>
<p>16.3. The data file for Bahcall&rsquo;s Standard Solar Model (Sect. 16.2.2, [4]) is
available online. You may use any appropriate software to analyze the data and
make plots. Note that in electronic files, we abbreviate scientific notation, so
that 6:02 � 1023 becomes 6.02E+23 (or just 6.02E23) and 1:38 � 10�16 becomes
1.38E�16.
(a) Use Eq. (16.15) to compute and plot the average particle mass (in units of mp)
</p>
<p>versus radius (in units of Rˇ). Make sure to label the axes with appropriate
units. You should see three fairly distinct zones: (i) the inner 20% of the Sun;
(ii) the region between 20 and 95% of the Sun&rsquo;s radius; (iii) the outer 5% of
the Sun. What is happening physically that distinguishes these three zones? Do
your results agree with Problem 16.1?</p>

</p>
<p>16.4. Problems 12.6 and 14.3 involve a model star with a uniform density of
hydrogen gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. Would such a star be stable or unstable
to convection?
</p>
<p>16.5. The lower limit to the main sequence occurs when the core temperature of a
star is not sufficient to fuse hydrogen into helium. In Sect. 1.3.2 we estimated the
central temperature of a star of mass M and radius R. For main sequence stars,
radius and mass are correlated: R / M ˛ with ˛ � 0:7 [14, 15]. In Sect. 15.2.2 we
estimated the central temperature required to support fusion. Put the pieces together
to estimate the mass (inMˇ) of the smallest star whose core is hot enough to ignite
fusion.
</p>
<p>16.6. The upper end of the main sequence occurs where radiation pressure is strong
enough to make a star unstable. In Sect. 1.3.2 we used dimensional analysis to derive
scaling relations for the central pressure and temperature of a star with massM and
radius R. Filling in the constants of proportionality by working in reference to the
Sun, we can write
</p>
<p>Pc D Pˇ
.M=Mˇ/2
</p>
<p>.R=Rˇ/4
and Tc D Tˇ
</p>
<p>.M=Mˇ/
</p>
<p>.R=Rˇ/
</p>
<p>This is the pressure required to counteract the pull of gravity. If a star is hot enough
that the pressure from photons (see Sect. 13.1.4),
</p>
<p>Prad D
�2.kT /4
</p>
<p>45.&bdquo;c/3
</p>
<p>is strong enough to counteract gravity, the star will be unstable. Find an expression
(in terms of symbols) for the mass at which this occurs. Then plug in numbers to
estimate the mass (inMˇ) at the upper end of the main sequence.</p>

<p>16.7. Estimate the duration of the core hydrogen and helium burning phases in
the life of a 4Mˇ star. In both phases, the star&rsquo;s luminosity is roughly 500Lˇ (see
Fig. 16.4).Why is the helium burning phase much shorter than the hydrogen burning
phase?
</p>
<p>16.8. Supernova 1987A occurred in the LargeMagellanic Cloud about 50 kpc from
Earth. Models indicate that about 1:5 � 1044 J went into the kinetic energy of the
explosion, with an ejected mass of about 20Mˇ. Estimate the typical speed of the
ejecta. About how long would it take for the ejecta to expand to subtend a radius of
0.1 arcsec on the sky such that we could resolve the debris as a supernova remnant?
You may assume for simplicity that the shell expands at a constant speed, but please
comment on how this assumption affects your answer.
</p>
<p>16.9. Here is how you can derive the freefall time for gravitational collapse.
</p>
<p>(a) Consider dropping a test particle from rest at a height r0 above a massM . Use
conservation of energy to determine the speed v of the particle at any height r .
</p>
<p>(b) With v.r/ D dr=dt we have a differential equation for r , which can be solved
by writing
</p>
<p>dr
</p>
<p>v.r/
D dt

M , r0, and constants. Hint: to evaluate the r integral, you may find it helpful to
change variables using r D r0 cos2 � .

<p>Stellar Remnants
</p>
<p>White dwarfs and neutron stars are dense objects left behind when low- and high-
mass stars die (respectively). These objects have no ongoing fusion to generate
the heat and pressure that normally counteract gravity, so the gas gets crushed to
incredibly dense states that are quite unfamiliar to us on Earth. Essentially, gravity
squeezes the gas until quantum mechanics pushes back. In this chapter we study
white dwarfs in some detail and discuss neutron stars briefly.1
</p>
<p>17.1 Cold, Degenerate Gas
</p>
<p>In physics, the term degeneracy describes a situation in which multiple states have
the same energy. If the lowest energy states in a gas are completely filled, we say
the gas is degenerate. Our first task is to determine the equation of state for such a
system. In Sect. 12.1.3 we derived a general expression for the pressure,
</p>
<p>P D 1

</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>p v n.p/ dp
</p>
<p>where n.p/ dp is the number density of particles with momentum between p and
p C dp (now in vector form). Let&rsquo;s introduce the concept of phase space as an
abstract space in which each possible state of a system is represented as a unique
point. For a particle, phase space has six dimensions; in Cartesian coordinates the six
dimensions are .x; y; z; px ; py ; pz/, but it is possible to use other coordinate systems
as well. Then n is the number of particles per unit phase space volume. This quantity
is more generally known as the phase space distribution function,
</p>
<p>1This presentation follows part of the book Black Holes, White Dwarfs, and Neutron Stars: The
Physics of Compact Objects by Shapiro and Teukolsky [1], which gives considerably more detail.

</p>
<p>In classical mechanics we treat phase space as continuous, but in quantum mechan-
ics we think of it being discretized into cells whose 6-d volume is h3, where h is
Planck&rsquo;s constant.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider gas that is &ldquo;cold.&rdquo; We will specify what this means in a moment;
for now it lets us say the system will arrange itself to minimize the total energy. In an
ideal gas the energy is all kinetic (there is no interaction potential), so the lowest
energy state has the particles packed as close as possible to the origin of momentum
space. The fundamental limitation comes from the Pauli exclusion principle: for
spin-1/2 particles like protons, neutrons, or electrons, the maximum number of
particles in each phase space cell is two (spin-up and spin-down). The configuration
that minimizes the total energy is a sphere centered on p D 0 that has two particles
in every cell out to some momentum threshold pF , which is referred to as the Fermi
momentum. In other words, the distribution function for the Fermi sphere is
</p>
<p>F D
(
</p>
<p>2h�3 p &lt; pF
</p>
<p>0 p &gt; pF
(17.2)
</p>
<p>Since white dwarfs and neutron stars emerge from the cores of dying stars, it may
not be clear whether they qualify as &ldquo;cold.&rdquo; The key is how the thermal energy
(ET , Sect. 12.1.2) compares with the kinetic energy at the surface of the Fermi
sphere (EF ). If ET � EF , then random thermal motions prevent particles from
settling into the Fermi sphere, and the gas is not degenerate. If ET � EF , by
contrast, then particles can settle into the Fermi sphere with little or no thermal
fluctuations above EF . In scenarios where EF is large, particles can have what we
might consider to be a high temperature&mdash;they can even be relativistic&mdash;yet still
qualify as &ldquo;cold&rdquo; in terms of the criterion for degeneracy. (See Problem 17.2 for
quantitative examples.)
</p>
<p>Given the distribution function, we can obtain the number density by integrating
over all momenta:
</p>

</p>
<p>3h3

</p>
<p>Turning this around, we can express the Fermi momentum in terms of the density:

<p>17.2 White Dwarfs 353
</p>
<p>Finally, combining the phase space distribution function (17.2) with the relativistic
expression (10.27) for v lets us write the pressure integral as

</p>
<p>This is the general expression for the pressure of a cold, degenerate gas.
</p>
<p>Non-relativistic Case
</p>
<p>If the gas is non-relativistic, having v � c and hence p � mc lets us simplify the
integrand to p4=m. Then we can evaluate the integral:
</p>

<p>�5=3
</p>
<p>(17.6)

<p>where we use Eq. (17.3) for pF . Collecting constants yields

</p>
<p>&bdquo;2

n5=3 (17.7)
</p>
<p>This is the exact equation of state for a non-relativistic, cold, degenerate gas.
You may recall that we obtained this expression&mdash;up to the numerical factors&mdash;
in Chap. 1 using dimensional analysis. Now we see where it comes from in detail.
</p>
<p>Ultra-relativistic Case
</p>
<p>If the gas is ultra-relativistic, having p � mc modifies the analysis. In Problem 17.1
you can work through this case to derive the equation of state
</p>
<p>P D .3�
2/1=3
</p>
<p>4
&bdquo; c n4=3 (17.8)
</p>
<p>Again, we found this expression using dimensional analysis in Chap. 1, but now we
see the details (and the numerical factors).
</p>
<p>17.2 White Dwarfs
</p>
<p>We have seen that the pressure of a degenerate gas depends on the number density
of particles, and in the non-relativistic case it depends inversely on the particle
mass. White dwarfs are typically composed of ionized carbon and/or oxygen (the
byproducts of the helium burning that is the last stage of fusion in a low-mass star;
see Sect. 16.3). Electrons outnumber nuclei and have smaller masses, so the pressure
comes mainly from electrons even though the mass is mostly in nuclei. In this</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>354 17 Stellar Remnants
</p>
<p>section we develop a model for a star composed of a cold, degenerate electron gas
and compare the model predictions with the properties of observed white dwarfs.
</p>
<p>17.2.1 Equation of State
</p>
<p>The analysis in Sect. 17.1 gives the pressure in terms of the number density of
particles, but in astrophysics we find it more convenient to work in terms of
mass density. To relate the electron number density to the mass density (which is
dominated by protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons), we use:
</p>
<p>ne D
�
</p>
<p># electrons
</p>
<p>nucleon
</p>
<p>��
</p>
<p># nucleons
</p>
<p>volume
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>D Z
A
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>mp
(17.9)
</p>
<p>where Z and A are the atomic number and atomic mass, respectively, and for our
purposes here it is adequate to say that all nucleons have mass mp. In the non-
relativistic case we can combine Eqs. (17.7) and (17.9) to write the pressure in terms
of � as
</p>
<p>P D .3�
2/2=3
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>&bdquo;2

</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>A
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>mp
</p>
<p>�5=3
</p>
<p>(17.10)
</p>
<p>while in the relativistic case we instead use (17.8) to obtain
</p>
<p>P D .3�
2/1=3
</p>
<p>4
&bdquo;c
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>A
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>mp
</p>
<p>�4=3
</p>
<p>(17.11)
</p>
<p>In both cases, the pressure has the form of a polytropic equation of state,
</p>
<p>P D K �1C1=n (17.12)
</p>
<p>where the constant K depends on the gas composition through Z and A, and the
polytropic index is
</p>
<p>n D
(
</p>
<p>3=2 non-relativistic
</p>
<p>3 relativistic
</p>
<p>(Please do not confuse this n with number density. The notation is unfortunate, but
it is so common that we will stick with it. It should be clear from context whether n
represents number density or polytropic index.)
</p>
<p>17.2.2 Polytropic Stars
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to the stellar structure equations in Sect. 16.2 and consider a star that
has gravity and polytropic pressure, but no energy production or transport. This is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.2 White Dwarfs 355
</p>
<p>a simplified but useful model for a white dwarf. (You can test the assumptions in
Problem 17.2.) In this case, the key equation of stellar structure is the equation of
hydrostatic equilibrium,

</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>dP
</p>
<p>dr
D �GM.r/
</p>
<p>Take the derivative of both sides, and use the mass equation dM=dr D 4�r2�:
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>r2
d
</p>
<p>dr
</p>

<p>�
</p>
<p>dP
</p>
<p>dr
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>D �4�G� (17.13)
</p>
<p>Now use the polytropic equation of state. It is convenient to introduce some new
variables. Let � be a dimensionless density variable defined by
</p>
<p>� D �c�n (17.14)
</p>
<p>where �c is the central density. Then the polytropic equation of state is
</p>
<p>P D K �1C1=nc �nC1
</p>
<p>Also, let � be a dimensionless radial coordinate defined by
</p>
<p>r D a� where a D
�
</p>
<p>nC 1
4�G
</p>
<p>K �1=n�1c
</p>
<p>�1=2
</p>
<p>(17.15)
</p>
<p>It is useful to invert the last equation and solve for �c :
</p>
<p>�c D
�
</p>
<p>.nC 1/K
4�G
</p>
<p>�n=.n�1/
a�2n=.n�1/ (17.16)
</p>
<p>The motivation for these choices becomes clear when we use the new variables in
Eq. (17.13):
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>a2�2

</p>
<p>a

For most values of n the solutions must be found numerically, but they are well
studied. We can use simple boundary conditions: �.0/ D 1 by construction from</p>

<p>Eq. (17.14), and � 0.0/ D 0 because we want the density to be smooth at the center.
Then there is a unique solution for each value of n, some of which are shown in
Fig. 17.1. For all cases n &lt; 5 the density goes to zero at some finite value of radius,
which corresponds to the surface:
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.2 White Dwarfs 357
</p>
<p>In the third step we use Eq. (17.17) to replace �n; then we evaluate the integral in
terms of �1 and � 0.�1/, which are tabulated above. Now replace �c using Eq. (17.16):
</p>
<p>M D 4�a3�2n=.n�1/

</p>
<p>.nC 1/K
4�G
</p>
<p>�n=.n�1/
�21 j� 0.�1/j
</p>
<p>Finally, use a D R=�1 from Eq. (17.18):
</p>
<p>M D 4� R.n�3/=.n�1/

<p>�n=.n�1/

</p>
<p>2
1 j� 0.�1/j (17.19)
</p>
<p>What was the point of all of this? We have obtained a relation between mass and
radius for a polytropic star. The collection of constants looks a little messy, but the
important scaling is
</p>
<p>M / R.n�3/=.n�1/
</p>
<p>For the non-relativistic case we have n D 3=2 and hence
</p>
<p>M / R�3 , R /M�1=3
</p>
<p>We found this scaling using dimensional analysis in Chap. 1, but nowwe have shown
it rigorously. Physically, a star with more mass needs more pressure to balance
gravity. If the star is supported by degeneracy pressure, electrons need to move
closer together in order for P to increase. Consequently, more massive stars must
be smaller.
</p>
<p>We can go further and fill in the constants. For the non-relativistic case we found

<p>This analysis reveals that all relativistic polytropic stars have the same mass, up
to the composition-dependent factor Z=A. For Z=A D 0:5 as appropriate for a
carbon/oxygen white dwarf, the mass is
</p>
<p>M D 1:44Mˇ (17.22)
</p>
<p>We can connect the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases with the following
physical picture. As a white dwarf becomes more massive, it shrinks according to
R / M�1=3. The rising density increases the Fermi momentum (Eq. 17.4) and
makes the system increasingly relativistic. Once the star reaches 1:44Mˇ (for
Z=A D 0:5) it is ultra-relativistic, and it cannot get any more massive and still
be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The upper limit on the mass of a
white dwarf is called the Chandrasekhar limit after Subramanyan Chandrasekhar,
who made the theoretical prediction in 1930.
</p>
<p>If a white dwarf exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, it will explode as a type Ia
supernova. These are objects that cosmologists have used as standard candles to
chart the expanding universe (see Chap. 18).
</p>
<p>17.2.3 Testing the Theory
</p>
<p>To recap, our detailed analysis of white dwarfs has yielded three key conceptual
points:
</p>
<p>1. A white dwarf the mass of the Sun is about the size of Earth.
2. More massive white dwarfs are smaller, withM / R�3.
3. There is a maximum allowed mass for an object supported by electron degener-
</p>
<p>acy pressure.
</p>
<p>How can we test these predictions?</p>

<p>White dwarfs were seen long ago but not recognized as particularly unusual until
the early twentieth century. One is a dim star discovered by William Herschel in
1783 in the triple star system 40 Eridani [2].2 Another is in a binary system with
Sirius, the brightest star in our night sky. Between 1834 and 1844, Friedrich Bessel
observed that Sirius moves as if it has a companion [3]. Christian Peters used the
motion to infer the orbit in 1851, and Alvan Clark identified the companion itself
in 1862 [4]. Today the Hubble Space Telescope can easily resolve the two stars
(see Fig. 17.2). The orbital motion reveals that the bright star has mass MA D
2:0Mˇ while the faint star has mass MB D 1:0Mˇ [5]. The small difference in
mass is surprising given the large difference in luminosity (a factor of nearly 1,000).
</p>
<p>Even more striking are the spectral properties of these stars. In 1910,
Henry Norris Russell, Edward Pickering, and Williamina Fleming used spectral
classification to realize that 40 Eridani B lies far below the main sequence in the
HR diagram [6, 7]. In 1915, Walter Adams discovered that the spectrum of Sirius B
is very similar to that of Sirius A despite the large difference in luminosity [8]. Now
we know that the faint star is actually hotter than the bright star (TB � 25;000K vs.
TA � 10;000K [5]). According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Eq. 13.1), an object
with a high temperature but low luminosity must be very small (see Problem 13.4).
</p>
<p>Today many more white dwarfs are known, although it is still challenging to
measuremasses and radii precisely enough to test theoretical predictions. (For a long
time, one obstacle was knowing distances well enough to convert flux to luminosity.
</p>
<p>2The brightest stars in our sky have individual names, but most stars are labeled by the name of the
constellation in which they appear on the sky, and a letter or number that indicates how they rank
among stars in that constellation.</p>

<p>In the 1990s the Hipparcos satellite measured precise distances for a large sample of
nearby stars, including some white dwarfs.) Here is a brief summary of the analysis.

<p>Mass. Three approaches have been used, depending on what information is
available.
</p>
<p>1. Binary star. If the white dwarf is in a binary system, the orbital motion yields
reliable masses (see Sect. 4.2).
</p>
<p>2. Surface gravity. The width of spectral lines depends on the strength of gravity
at the star&rsquo;s surface, g D GM=R2. Increasing g raises the gas pressure and
density, leading to more frequent collisions that perturb atomic and molecular
energy levels. Measuring g from the star&rsquo;s spectrum and R from (17.23) makes
it possible to infer the mass.
</p>
<p>3. Gravitational redshift. Photons emitted by a star lose some energy as they
climb out of the gravitational potential well, and thus shift to slightly longer</p>

</p>
<p>wavelengths (see Sect. 10.3.4). This gravitational redshift offers another way to
determine the strength of gravity at the star&rsquo;s surface, which can be combined
with the radius to find the mass.
</p>
<p>Observational data are compared with theoretical predictions in Fig. 17.3. Many
of the errorbars are fairly large, indicating the challenge in making the mea-
surements. Nevertheless, the agreement with theory is quite good, especially for
the predictions that white dwarfs are comparable in size to Earth and more
massive white dwarfs are smaller. There is some scatter among the observed white
dwarfs, which can be interpreted as evidence that the stars have different internal
compositions and/or different atmospheres (see [9]). The bottom line is that objects
made of the novel state of matter known as degenerate gas do exist, and we
understand their properties.
</p>
<p>17.3 Neutron Stars and Pulsars
</p>
<p>Neutrons stars are also supported by degeneracy pressure, but from neutrons rather
than electrons. The difference is important because degeneracy pressure depends on
the number density of particles. Since they are so muchmoremassive, neutronsmust
have a higher mass density than electrons to create a comparable number density
and hence pressure. Neutron stars are therefore much smaller than white dwarfs&mdash;
typically about 10 km in radius (see Problem 17.6).
</p>
<p>Being so compact, neutron stars have very strong gravity, which means general
relativity is needed for any detailed analysis. Furthermore, the neutrons are so
close together that interactions between them cannot be ignored, which means the
equation of state for dense nuclear matter plays a role as well. These two facts make
neutron stars more complicated in detail than white dwarfs, but many of the key
conceptual ideas are similar. (See [1] for details.)
</p>
<p>Observationally, we study neutrons stars primarily as pulsars. Neutron stars tend
to rotate very rapidly. (If a spinning star shrinks, it must spin faster to conserve
angular momentum.) They also have strong magnetic fields (another consequence
of having shrunk), which causes them to emit strong beams of radio waves from
their magnetic poles. If the magnetic poles are not aligned with the spin axis, the
radio beams sweep through space like beams from a lighthouse, and if one reaches
Earth we detect periodic pulses of radio waves. Hence the name pulsar.
</p>
<p>Pulsars are observed to have spin periods in the range of seconds down to mil-
liseconds.3 Moreover, they are extremely regular, and the periods can be measured
incredibly precisely; for example, the binary pulsar system PSR J0737�3039 has an
orbital period of 0:10225156248 day, with an uncertainty of˙5 in the last digit [10].
Such precision is rare in astronomy, and it makes pulsars important tools for testing

Antony Hewish in 1974, and Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor Jr. in 1993. Using
pulsar timing to test relativity continues to be the focus of exciting research (e.g.,
[10, 11]).

<p>17.2. We have assumed the gas in a white dwarf is cold and degenerate, while
the gas inside the Sun is not degenerate. Measurements suggest the assumptions
are reasonable (see Fig. 17.3), but we should check the numbers. As discussed in
Sect. 17.1, the key is how the thermal and Fermi energies compare. For each of the
following cases, calculate ET and EF and determine whether the gas is degenerate.

<p>Charting the Universe with Stars
</p>
<p>The physics of stars has turned out to be surprisingly important for cosmology. If
we understand how stars work, we can use their observed properties to infer their
intrinsic luminosities, and combine those with measured fluxes to determine dis-
tances. Finding stars at different distances then allows us to map the geometry of the
universe. Two types of stars have come to play vital roles in cosmology: pulsating
stars called Cepheids, and exploding white dwarfs called type Ia supernovae.
</p>
<p>18.1 Stellar Pulsations
</p>
<p>As we will see, we do not actually need to understand the physics of Cepheid
variable stars in detail to use them as distance indicators. Nevertheless, the general
ideas (if not the full details) are interesting and within our reach, so it is worthwhile
to take a brief look at stellar pulsations.
</p>
<p>18.1.1 Observations
</p>
<p>For at least 400 years (and probably longer) people have noted that certain stars
vary in brightness. In 1595, David Fabricius saw that o Ceti faded to the point that
it became invisible to the naked eye, then returned to visibility, with a period of
11 months (see Fig. 18.1). He named the star Mira, meaning &ldquo;wonderful.&rdquo; In 1784,
John Goodricke discovered that ı Cephei varies with a period of a little over 5 days.
This is the prototype for a class of stars now called Cepheids.
</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century,Henrietta Swan Leavitt was one of the &ldquo;computers&rdquo;
working at Harvard (like Williamina Fleming and Annie Jump Cannon, whom we
encountered in Chap. 14). Leavitt discovered some 2,400 Cepheids by painstakingly
comparing photographs of star fields taken at different times and identifying stars

<p>that varied. Many of them were in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy
orbiting the Milky Way. Leavitt noticed that the brighter Cepheids seemed to have
longer periods. Since all the stars were in the SMC, she knew the stars that appeared
to be brighter were intrinsically more luminous. To check for a connection between
period and luminosity, Leavitt plotted the two quantities as shown in Fig. 18.2. Her
discovery of the Cepheid period/luminosity relation&mdash;now known as the Leavitt
law [1]&mdash;was a breakthrough in our ability to chart the universe (as we will see in
Sect. 18.2).</p>

</p>
<p>Now many different kinds of variable stars are known, with periods as long as
hundreds of days (as for Mira) or as short as hours or even minutes. Several classes
of variable stars, including Cepheids, lie in a particular region of the HR diagram.
This &ldquo;instability strip&rdquo; intersects the horizontal branch of the stellar evolution tracks,
implying that the stars are in the helium core burning stage of their lives. We now
understand that these stars are pulsating&mdash;rhythmically expanding and contracting
or undergoing even more complex oscillations.
</p>
<p>18.1.2 Theory
</p>
<p>Pulsations in Cepheids are thought to be driven by a mechanism known as the
&ldquo;Eddington valve&rdquo; [3, 4]. Suppose there is region of the star where compressing
the gas causes the opacity to rise. If the star contracts, the opacity increases and acts
as a closed valve, trapping light and causing heat and pressure to build. Conversely,
if the star expands, the opacity decreases and the valve opens. A star has to have a
region with a significant amount of partially ionized helium in order for opacity to
behave this way, which is why opacity-driven pulsations occur in a specific region
of the HR diagram.
</p>
<p>Treating the valve mechanism in detail is beyond the scope of our analysis, but
we can make a model that captures the basic physics. The key ingredient is having</p>

</p>
<p>Furthermore, let&rsquo;s assume the star expands and contracts as a whole, maintaining
spherical symmetry. Then we can obtain an equation of motion by considering a
spherical shell of massm at the surface of a star of massM and radius R. Applying
Newton&rsquo;s second law to the shell yields

it would have some radiusR0 and pressure P0. Setting d2R=dt2 D 0 in equilibrium,
we can solve the equation of motion to find

possibility below.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.1 Stellar Pulsations 369
</p>
<p>This is the scaled equation of motion for pulsations if the equation of state has the
form of Eq. (18.1). As with polytropic stars in Sect. 17.2.2, we have made some
progress with the differential equation by identifying the key physical scalings so
that the remaining piece is dimensionless.
</p>
<p>In Problem 18.1 you can work with numerical solutions to Eq. (18.5). To
make further analytic process here, let&rsquo;s imagine that the oscillations have a small
amplitude such that
</p>
<p>� D 1C ı� with ı� � 1

<p>d�2
� �.K � 4/ ı� (18.6)
</p>
<p>IfK &gt; 4, this is the equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator. The angular
frequency in scaled units is .K � 4/1=2, so when we put in the physical scaling from
Eq. (18.4) we obtain the angular frequency and period in physical units as follows:

</p>
<p>(18.7)
</p>
<p>We see that the period depends on the star properties through the combination
M=R30, which is proportional to the mean density. From the Vogt-Russell theorem
of stellar structure (see Sect. 16.2.3), the radius and mean density are determined
mainly by the mass, and to a lesser extent by the composition; thus, there should be
a reasonably tight relation between period and mass. Since pulsating stars lie on the
horizontal branch in the HR diagram, and thus are in a similar phase of evolution,
there is a close relation between mass and luminosity. Putting the pieces together,
we imagine there to be a reasonably tight relation between period and luminosity&mdash;
which is exactly what Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered.

<p>What can we say quantitatively about the scaling of period with mass? If we
postulate that stars on the horizontal branch have a mass&ndash;radius relation of the form
R /M ˛, then the period scales as ˘ / M .3˛�1/=2. If ˛ &gt; 1=3 then the period will
increase as the mass increases. In the examples below we see that this is indeed the
case.
</p>
<p>The period clearly depends on K . Without getting into details of the Eddington
valve, we might consider a simple case in which the fluctuations are adiabatic. From
Eq. (16.4), the adiabatic equation of state is P / R�3&#13; where the adiabatic index &#13;
is the ratio of specific heats. An ideal, non-relativistic, monatomic gas has &#13; D 5=3
and henceK D 5. We use this in Eq. (18.7) and plug in numbers to work in reference
to the Sun:</p>

<p>This leads to the following quantitative examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; If the Sun were to pulsate in the way we have described, it would have a period
of about 0.12 day. (It would not actually be a Cepheid, though, because it is not
in the helium burning phase.)
</p>
<p>&bull; The star ı Cephei is the original Cepheid variable. It has M � 5Mˇ and R �
45Rˇ [5,6], so our model predicts˘ D 15:6 day. For comparison, the observed
period is 5.4 days.
</p>
<p>&bull; Well-studied Cepheids in our galaxy have masses in the range 4&ndash;11Mˇ and radii
in the range 30&ndash;120Rˇ [6,7]. The corresponding range of periods, according to
our model, is then:

</p>
<p>For comparison, the observed range of periods is about 3&ndash;40 day.
</p>
<p>Our model is not highly accurate because it is based on a simplified treatment of the
pulsation physics. Nevertheless, it gives useful estimates, and it reveals in a general
way how the pulsation period depends on the properties (mass and radius) of a star.
</p>
<p>18.2 Standard Candles
</p>
<p>The practical value of Cepheids comes from their use as distance indicators. Since
we cannot lay down a ruler to another star, let alone another galaxy, we need to
find indirect ways to measure distances. Distance appears, of course, in the inverse
square law relating flux and luminosity,2
</p>
<p>2In an expanding universe, the d in (18.8) is the &ldquo;luminosity distance&rdquo; (see Sect. 11.3.2).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.2 Standard Candles 371
</p>
<p>F D L
4�d 2
</p>
<p>(18.8)
</p>
<p>We measure F , so if we somehow knew L then we could use Eq. (18.8) to infer d .
Put another way, if we had a set of standard candles with known luminosities, we
could use their fluxes to determine their distances.
</p>
<p>The Leavitt law made that possible by letting astronomers determine a Cepheid&rsquo;s
luminosity from a direct measurement of its pulsation period. In fact, it was
by combining Cepheid-based distance measurements with Doppler-based veloc-
ity measurements that Edwin Hubble discovered the expanding universe (see
Sect. 11.1). Astronomers have continued to refine and extend the use of Cepheids as
standard candles, even making it a Key Project for the Hubble Space Telescope [8].
</p>
<p>There are some challenges in using standard candles to chart the universe. As
a matter of principle, we might be concerned that we lack a complete theoretical
interpretation of the Leavitt law. While we can understand the general physics of
stellar pulsations (as in Sect. 18.1), that is not the same as predicting Cepheid prop-
erties from first principles. The period/luminosity relation that we use is primarily
empirical, and we cannot be certain that it captures all of the important physics.
For example, luminosity may depend on variables beyond period, such as color and
metallicity (see [1]). If additional parameters are important, neglecting them could
create scatter in the period/luminosity relation; that would be inconvenient but not
terrible. More troublesome is the possibility that there could be a systematic shift
in the period/luminosity relation between different galaxies that have, say, different
distributions of metallicity. Fortunately, such a possibility can be tested empirically
by comparing the period/luminosity relation in many different galaxies.
</p>
<p>As a matter of practice, we need to calibrate Cepheids as standard candles before
we can use them to measure distances. Strictly speaking, what Henrietta Swan
Leavitt discovered was a relation between period and flux for a set of Cepheids in
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Since the stars were all at (essentially) the same
distance from Earth, there was a direct proportionality between flux and luminosity,
but in order to determine the proportionality constant&mdash;and thereby calibrate
the period/luminosity relation&mdash;Leavitt needed an independent measurement of the
distance to the SMC. Today, astronomers use two main techniques to establish the
calibration. One is to measure distances to Cepheids in our own Milky Way galaxy
using parallax.3 The other is to observe Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC), and then measure the distance to the LMC independently (which can be
done several different ways; see [1] for a review). Figure 18.3 shows that the two
techniques yield consistent results for the relation between period and luminosity.
</p>
<p>Last but not least, Cepheids can be observed (even with the Hubble Space
Telescope) only in galaxies that are relatively nearby in cosmic terms. If we want
to chart galaxies that are more distant, we need to find a different standard candle.
</p>
<p>3Parallax is a kind of triangulation that uses Earth&rsquo;s motion around the Sun to provide a different
perspective on nearby stars relative to background objects (see Sect. 2.1).</p>

<p>This is where type Ia supernovae became important tools for cosmology. The light
curves of these exploding stars exhibit a characteristic rise and fall, and the duration
and shape of the curve turn out to be related to the peak luminosity (as shown in
the top panel of Fig. 18.4). Correcting for the &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; makes it possible to place
supernovae on a common curve so they serve as standard candles (bottom panel of
Fig. 18.4).
</p>
<p>Type Ia supernovae are bright enough to be seen at great distances (out to
cosmological redshifts of z � 1 and beyond, corresponding to billions of light
years). As with Cepheids, though, we lack a theoretical understanding of the all-
important relation&mdash;in this case, between light curve shape and luminosity. We
know that type Ia supernovae occur when a white dwarf accretes enough mass from
a binary companion to cross the Chandrasekhar limit and explode (see Sect. 17.2.2),
but we do not know whether the companion is another white dwarf or a non-
degenerate star. While we do not necessarily need to understand all of the details
in order to use type Ia supernovae to measure distances, we do need to consider the
possibility that the explosions might not always be the same. This, again, is an issue
that can be tested empirically by observing a large sample of supernovae in different
galaxies.</p>

astronomers have dealt with imperfect knowledge of the Hubble constant.) For the horizontal axis,
time is measured from the peak brightness; the explosion occurs a few weeks before the peak. The

the observed relation has been used to derive a &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; factor that places all of the supernovae

<p>To calibrate type Ia supernovae as standard candles, we can piggyback off
of Cepheids: if a supernova is observed in a galaxy whose distance has been
measured with Cepheids, we can use that supernova and its distance as an anchor
for measuring other supernova distances. The idea of using different but overlapping
distance indicators is known as building a distance ladder. While modern distance
ladders have a number of parallel and interlocking rungs, stellar pulsations and</p>

</p>
<p>explosions still play a central role in charting the universe. In fact, it was Cepheid-
calibrated type Ia supernovae that led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion
of the universe (see Fig. 11.4).
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>18.1. We can study pulsations numerically to complement the analysis in
Sect. 18.1.2.4 Section A.6 discusses a computational algorithm to solve a second-
order differential equation such as (18.5). Implement the algorithm in a spreadsheet
or computer program. To obtain a specific solution you need to give initial
conditions �init and vinit; one reasonable approach is to set vinit D 0.
(a) Briefly explain how you solve the differential equation.
(b) Assume an adiabatic equation of state with &#13; D 5=3. Plot the size of the star
</p>
<p>and the velocity of the surface (in scaled units) assuming �init D 1:05. Determine
the oscillation period of your numerical solution, and explain how you did it.
Calculate the expected period of small-amplitude oscillations from Eq. (18.7).
How well do the period values agree?
</p>
<p>(c) Pick a different value of K , find the numerical solution, and compare the
oscillation period with the prediction from Eq. (18.7).
</p>
<p>(d) Now go back to the case with &#13; D 5=3 and try �init D 0:65. What is the
oscillation period? Why don&rsquo;t these plots look like your previous ones? Why
doesn&rsquo;t the analytic prediction do a good job here?
</p>
<p>18.2. In this problem you can get a sense of how to use Cepheids as standard
candles to measure distances.
</p>
<p>(a) Imagine you observe 5 Cepheids in a galaxy 1Mpc away, with the following
periods and fluxes:
</p>
<p>Star P (day) F= OF
A 10.75 1.17
B 46.53 6.80
C 6.19 0.48
D 36.07 4.15
E 7.89 0.86
</p>
<p>Here OF is a reference flux value, taken to be the flux of a Cepheid with a period
of OP D 10 day when seen from a distance of 1Mpc. Make a plot of logP
</p>
<p>4This problem is inspired by Problem 14.13 in the book by Carroll and Ostlie [10], but we work
with the dimensionless version of the equation of motion (18.5).</p>

</p>
<p>and logF (similar to Fig. 18.3) and use it to calibrate a relation of the form
F= OF D .P= OP/˛ by determining ˛. Hints: a power law relation appears as a
straight line in a log-log plot; there is some &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in the data, so the plot will
not be a perfect line.
</p>
<p>(b) Now suppose you observe a second galaxy and discover a Cepheid with period
P2 D 18:34 day and flux F2= OF D 0:22. How far away is galaxy #2?
</p>
<p>18.3. In this problem you can see how to construct a distance ladder. Suppose you
observe 10 galaxies: in #1 you measure a well-calibrated Cepheid; in #2&ndash;3 you
see both Cepheids and type Ia supernovae; and in #4&ndash;10 you find SN Ia. Here are
the data, including distance and Doppler velocity where known. (The flux units
are arbitrary.) For this problem, assume Cepheids have a simple period/luminosity

<p>Star and Planet Formation
</p>
<p>Now that we have discussed the life and death of stars, we should say a few
words about their birth as well. Stars form out of gas clouds when gravity conquers
pressure, causing the clouds to collapse and fragment into pieces that can become
individual solar systems. The process is complicated, and we will not try to capture
all of the details, but with some judicious simplifications we can elucidate the key
physics.1
</p>
<p>19.1 Gravitational Collapse
</p>
<p>Many gas clouds achieve a state of (near) equilibrium in which the inward force
of gravity is balanced by the outward force from pressure. In order to form stars,
the gas must be able to collapse to the high densities (and temperatures) that enable
fusion. To understand how that happens, we need to understand both the state of
equilibrium and the conditions for collapse.
</p>
<p>19.1.1 Equilibrium: Virial Temperature
</p>
<p>Consider a gas cloud in equilibriumwith pressure balancing gravity. Suppose the gas
is cold, so there is no fusion, and the only force is gravity. (The pressure is created by
particles flying around; it is not a different force.) In Sect. 8.1.3 we proved the virial
theorem, which describes the relation between the (average) kinetic and potential
energies for an equilibrium system of particles interacting via gravity:

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.1 Gravitational Collapse 379
</p>
<p>Example: Giant Molecular Cloud
</p>
<p>Our galaxy contains many gas clouds that are cool enough to have molecules whose
rotational modes allow them to emit light at radio wavelengths (see Sect. 13.4.4).
Despite the presence of the complex molecules, the gas clouds are still pre-
dominantly hydrogen. Some typical numbers are M � 1;000Mˇ and n �
108&ndash;1010m�3. Since the hydrogen is mostly in molecular form (H2), the average
particle mass is Nm � 2mp. For the quoted range of densities, the virial temperature
is in the range Tvir � 60&ndash;270K. For comparison, the clouds are actually at
temperatures more like 20K. We will soon see what this means for such clouds.
</p>
<p>Example: Protogalaxy
</p>
<p>While our focus in this chapter is on stars, the physical processes that underlie
the virial temperature also apply to gas clouds out of which galaxies form, so
it is worthwhile to take a brief sidetrack. A protogalaxy might have something
like M � 1012Mˇ and R � 300 kpc. This yields a mean mass density of
� � 6 � 10�25 kgm�3, or a mean number density of n � 7 � 102m�3 for Nm D
mp=2 as appropriate for ionized hydrogen. The corresponding virial temperature is
T � 2 � 105K. Protogalaxies are quite hot (albeit diffuse) because a lot of energy
is liberated by gravitational collapse.
</p>
<p>19.1.2 Conditions for Collapse
</p>
<p>What happens if the actual temperature is below the virial temperature? The
particles move slowly, so the kinetic energy is small, and there is no way to have
2KCU D 0. This means the virial theorem does not apply and the cloud cannot be
in equilibrium. Rather, it must collapse.
</p>
<p>James Jeans first formulated the conditions under which a cloud will collapse.
He studied a general form of the problem [3, 4], but we can get at the essential
physics through a toy model. Consider a cloud of mass M and radius R. Suppose
we squeeze it so the radius decreases by an amount dR. (For clarity, we assume
dR &gt; 0 and keep track of signs explicitly.) Originally, the gravitational potential
energy is

<p>Since the gas has pressure P D nkT , when we squeeze we do work on it, which

<p>If the term in parentheses is negative, it is energetically favorable for the cloud to
shrink, so the cloud will spontaneously begin to collapse. In order for this to happen,
the mass must exceed the following threshold:
</p>
<p>M &gt;
5kTR
</p>
<p>G Nm
</p>
<p>We can express the condition for collapse in a different way if we go back to
Eq. (19.3) and write R in terms ofM and the mean density �. This yields a limit on
the mass (at fixed density):

<p>This is the Jeans density. The threshold values are not highly precise because they
were derived under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and uniform density, but
they are still useful as estimates of the conditions required for a cloud to be able to
collapse under its own gravity.
</p>
<p>19.1.3 Fragmentation
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the example of giant molecular clouds in Sect. 19.1.1. Recall the
typical numbers: mass M � 1;000Mˇ, average particle mass Nm � 2mp, and
temperature T � 20K. Then the Jeans density corresponds to a number density of</p>

</p>
<p>�3
</p>
<p>� 4 � 106m�3
</p>
<p>The actual density of the cloud (n � 108&ndash;1010m�3) exceeds the Jeans threshold by
several orders of magnitude, so the cloud ought to be able to collapse. The fact that
molecular clouds still exist suggests that having a density above the Jeans density
may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for collapse. In Sect. 19.3.3 we will
discuss other processes that might support a cloud against collapse.
</p>
<p>For now, though, let&rsquo;s carry on and think about what happens when the cloud
does start to collapse. Suppose the cloud is not perfectly uniform but has some
lumps where the density is a little higher. Consider a lump of mass �Mˇ. Since
nJ / M�2, the Jeans density for the lump is more like nJ � 1012m�3. This is
much higher than the density of the lump itself, so the lump cannot collapse any
further within the cloud.
</p>
<p>However, as the whole cloud collapses, everything becomes more dense. Even-
tually the density gets high enough that the�Mˇ lump crosses its Jeans density. At
that point the lump essentially separates from the global cloud and collapses on its
own within the cloud.
</p>
<p>This process can repeat itself throughout the cloud, wherever the density was a
little higher than average. The cloud fragments into a bunch of smaller, collapsing
lumps. It is those lumps that will eventually form individual stars.
</p>
<p>The fragmentation can happen over a variety of scales, meaning there are lumps
of differentmasses. That, in turn, leads to a population of stars with differentmasses.
We describe the resulting distribution of masses with the initial mass function
(IMF), which we write as dN=dM such that
</p>
<p>dN
</p>
<p>dM
dM D number of stars with mass betweenM andM C dM
</p>
<p>In practice, there are a few high-mass stars and many low-mass stars. Salpeter [5]
analyzed the population of stars near the Sun and inferred that the IMF could be
approximated by the function
</p>
<p>dN
</p>
<p>dM
/M�2:35 (19.6)
</p>
<p>at least over the range 0:4&ndash;10Mˇ. Since the exponent is negative, the number
of stars decreases as the mass increases. There is still a lot of work underway to
understand the IMF in detail (see [6]), but we will use the Salpeter IMF as a simple
model for quantitative estimates.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>382 19 Star and Planet Formation
</p>
<p>19.1.4 Collapse Time Scale
</p>
<p>What happens if the Jeans criterion is satisfied and the cloud can collapse? If the
temperature is low enough that the pressure is negligible, the cloud will go into
freefall and collapse on the freefall time scale (see Sect. 16.4.2),
</p>
<p>tff D

</p>
<p>��1=2
� n
</p>
<p>106m�3
</p>
<p>��1=2
(19.7)
</p>
<p>For the giant molecular cloud we have been considering, with Nm � 2mp and n �
108&ndash;1010m�3, the freefall time scale is in the range of hundreds of thousands to
millions of years. That is relatively short on astronomical time scales.
</p>
<p>19.2 Gas Cooling
</p>
<p>The Jeans criteria merely indicate whether it is possible for a cloud to begin to
collapse; they do not say anything about what happens next. Consider: as the cloud
shrinks, the gravitational potential energy decreases. By conservation of energy, the
kinetic energy must increase. This corresponds to a higher temperature, which by
the ideal gas law translates into more pressure. In other words, even if a cloud is
initially able to collapse, at some point the pressure will rise to the point that it halts
the collapse. Stars are much, much smaller than the clouds out of which they form,
so star forming clouds must have some way to get rid of excess energy and prevent
pressure from building up. How do they do that?
</p>
<p>When we studied ideal gases (Sect. 12.1), we treated the gas particles as billiard
balls with no internal energy states, so all collisions between particles were elastic.
Real gas particles do have internal energy states, though. This makes it possible
to have inelastic collisions that transfer some of the kinetic energy into particles&rsquo;
internal energy. Depending on the physical state of the gas, various things can
happen2:
</p>
<p>&bull; The collision can breakmolecules apart. The dissociation of molecular hydrogen
(H2) absorbs 4.5 eV per molecule.
</p>
<p>&bull; The collision can ionize an atom. Ionization of atomic hydrogen absorbs 13.6 eV
per atom.
</p>
<p>&bull; The collision can excite an electron inside an atom (without ionizing it). The atom
will subsequently decay by emitting light. If the gas is optically thin, the light can
escape, carrying away the energy.
</p>
<p>&bull; The collision can excite a vibrational or rotational mode of a molecule. The
molecule will subsequently decay and emit light.
</p>
<p>2We discussed collisional excitation and ionization in Sect. 14.1, and molecular vibration and
rotation in Sect. 13.4.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.2 Gas Cooling 383
</p>
<p>In the first two cases the gas itself absorbs energy, while in the last two cases the gas
converts kinetic energy into light. Either way, the bottom line is that kinetic energy
decreases&mdash;the gas cools.
</p>
<p>When we quantify gas cooling, it is convenient to write the energy loss rate in a
form that explicitly identifies the dependence on global quantities (such as volume
and density) so the piece that depends on atomic physics is scale-free. The energy
loss rate has dimensions of energy/time, so it is equivalent to a luminosity. It surely
scales with the overall volume of the gas cloud. It must depend on density through
n2 because collisions involve two particles and the collision rate scales with n2.
Putting the pieces together, we write
</p>
<p>Lcool D V n2� (19.8)
</p>
<p>where the factor� is called the cooling function, which has dimensions
</p>
<p>Œ�&#141; D

</p>

</p>
<p>We will say more about the cooling function as it applies to star-forming clouds
below. For now, we assume� is known and ask how the cooling rate compares with
the rate at which gas is heated by collapse. If we neglect dimensionless factors, we
can take V � R3 �M=. Nmn/ and write

<p>In the second line we use dR=dt � .GM=R/1=2 and d2R=dt2 � GM=R2, which
come from dimensional analysis and are valid for freefall collapse. Now let&rsquo;s define
the cooling efficiency to be the ratio of the cooling and heating rates:</p>

</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>The idea now is that if "cool &amp; 1 then cooling is efficient and the collapse will occur
on the freefall time scale. By contrast, if "cool � 1 then cooling is inefficient so the
collapse will be limited by the time it takes the gas cloud to get rid of its excess
kinetic energy.
</p>
<p>Application to Star-Forming Clouds
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to the example of a giant molecular cloud with M � 1;000Mˇ, n �
108&ndash;1010m�3, Nm � 2mp, and T � 20K. At this temperature, molecular rotation
is the main coolant because the kinetic energy is too low for collisions to dissociate
molecules, ionize atoms, or even excite electrons. Neufeld et al. [7] study rotational
cooling of dense molecular gas in detail. At a density of n � 109m�3 they find� �
10�42 Jm3 s�1, which translates into a cooling efficiency of "cool � 13. Therefore
the gas should be able to cool quickly enough to collapse on a time scale close to
the freefall time, which is tff � 106 yr for this density. For comparison, at a density
of n � 1010m�3 Neufeld et al. find � � 10�43 Jm3 s�1, which translates into
"cool � 2. While the efficiency is lower, it should still be adequate to allow the
collapse to proceed at a rate not too much slower than freefall, which has a time
scale of tff � 4 � 105 yr for this density.
</p>
<p>In other words, our estimates suggest that cooling should allow molecular clouds
to collapse, and to do so on time scales of millions of years. Why, then, do molecular
clouds still exist in a galaxy like the Milky Way, which is billions of years old?
There must be other physical processes that come into play; we will mention some
possibilities in Sect. 19.3.3 below.
</p>
<p>19.3 Halting the Collapse
</p>
<p>If freefall and cooling continued forever, gas clouds would collapse all the way to
black holes. That does not happen, so we must ask what processes could slow or
halt the collapse.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.3 Halting the Collapse 385
</p>
<p>19.3.1 Cessation of Cooling
</p>
<p>As the gas collapses and becomes more dense, eventually the mean free path for
light becomes smaller than the size of the cloud. Once that happens, light emitted
by atoms and molecules will be scattered and/or reabsorbed before it can escape.
The photons begin to bounce around inside the gas, so the gas becomes opaque,
and the system begins to behave like a blackbody (see Sect. 13.1). A protostar has
formed.
</p>
<p>The protostar will continue to contract, but more slowly than before because all it
can do is convert gravitational energy into blackbody radiation. This is the Kelvin-
Helmholtz mechanism that we discussed in Sect. 15.1 (when we ruled it out as the
power source for the Sun). As we saw there, the time scale for Kelvin-Helmholtz
collapse is � 107 yr for a star like the Sun. The star goes through a series of steps
before igniting regular hydrogen fusion and settling onto the main sequence in the
HR diagram. (Other books, such as An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics by
Carroll and Ostlie [1], discuss pre-main-sequence evolution in more detail.)
</p>
<p>19.3.2 Radiation Pressure
</p>
<p>Once the protostar begins to glow as a blackbody, the light itself can exert an
outward force that opposes gravity. (Recall our discussion of radiation pressure in
Sect. 13.1.4.) If the luminosity is high enough, the outward force from light can
overpower the inward force from gravity and halt the collapse. What is the condition
for this to occur?
</p>
<p>First consider the force from radiation pressure. If the luminosity is L, the
energy flux (energy per unit area per unit time) at distance r is L=.4�r2/. Each
photon carries energy h�, so the number of photons per unit area per unit time
is L=.4�r2h�/. Light interacts mainly with electrons, and the cross section for a
photon to interact with an electron is given by the Thomson cross section,

<p>�T D

</p>
<p>3m2ec
4
</p>
<p>D 6:65 � 10�29m2 (19.12)
</p>
<p>Therefore the number of photons per unit time that interact with a given electron
is L�T =.4�r2h�/. Each photon carries momentum h�=c, so the change in the
momentum of the electron is

</p>
<p>(19.13)
</p>
<p>Now consider gravity. This acts mainly on protons, because they are so much more
massive than electrons; but the gas is mainly hydrogen, so there are equal numbers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>386 19 Star and Planet Formation
</p>
<p>of protons and electrons and it is fine to work with electrons for the light force and
protons for the gravity force. The force on a proton at distance r is

<p>Fgrav D

</p>
<p>r2
(19.14)
</p>
<p>Equating (19.13) and (19.14) lets us find the luminosity for which the outward light
force exactly balances the inward gravity force:

</p>
<p>This is known as the Eddington luminosity. Here are some examples, which
involve mature stars rather than protostars but are illustrative:
</p>
<p>&bull; The Sun&rsquo;s luminosity is well below the Eddington value for its mass, so radiation
pressure has a negligible effect.
</p>
<p>&bull; O stars are much more luminous than the Sun. Consider an O star with M D
60Mˇ and L D 8 � 105Lˇ. How does the actual luminosity compare with the
Eddington value for this mass?

<p>Radiation pressure does not dominate gravity, but it is hardly negligible.
</p>
<p>Aside: Quasars
</p>
<p>While our focus in this chapter is on stars, the effects of radiation pressure are
interesting in a different context. As discussed in Sect. 3.2.3, quasars and other active
galactic nuclei are small but bright objects in which the light is emitted by matter
that is heated as it falls into a supermassive black hole. Infall can occur only if the
luminosity does not exceed the Eddington limit:

<p>For a given luminosity, we can turn this into a lower limit on the mass of the black

<p>Before direct dynamical measurements were available (see Sect. 3.2.2), this argu-
ment provided indirect evidence that black holes could be very massive.
</p>
<p>19.3.3 Other Effects
</p>
<p>In our discussion of giant molecular clouds we have found that the density typically
exceeds the Jeans threshold for collapse, and cooling ought to be quite efficient, so
we might wonder why the clouds still exist. The answer, presumably, is that some
physical effects we have not considered play a role. One possibility is external
heating. Light from bright stars near a gas cloud may ionize gas atoms and
inject heat through the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. Also, cosmic rays
are charged particles that can carry enormous amounts of kinetic energy (up to
1014MeV), some of which may be transferred to the gas through collisions.
</p>
<p>In addition, there may be turbulence in the gas, and it is not easy for gas to get
rid of kinetic energy associated with turbulent motion. Finally, if there is a magnetic
field in the cloud it can provide additional support against collapse. Magnetic fields
act a little bit like rubber bands threading the gas. The tension in the rubber bands
provides resistance when the gas tries to collapse.
</p>
<p>Clearly our discussion of the physics of star formation is far from complete.
Nevertheless, with gravitational collapse and gas cooling we have understood some
of the most important concepts.
</p>
<p>Recap
</p>
<p>Even our simplified discussion of star/galaxy formation has covered a lot of ground,
so let&rsquo;s review the key elements:
</p>
<p>&bull; Stars form by the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of gas clouds.
&bull; A cloudmust exceed the Jeans threshold (onmass or density) in order to collapse.
&bull; Gravitational collapse heats the gas, so a cloud needs to cool if it is to shrink
</p>
<p>enough to form stars. It does so by dissociating molecules, ionizing atoms, and/or
radiating light.
</p>
<p>&bull; A cloud will fragment as it collapses, creating stars with a wide range of masses.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>388 19 Star and Planet Formation
</p>
<p>&bull; The collapse halts with the formation of a protostar that is dense enough to trap
light inside.
</p>
<p>19.4 Protoplanetary Disks
</p>
<p>Now that we have developed a basic picture of how stars are born, let&rsquo;s think about
how planets form around those stars. The key idea is that angular momentum keeps
some of the matter from falling into the star itself; this matter settles into a disk
in which planets can grow. Our goal here is to understand gross features of our
Solar System like the difference between the inner, terrestrial planets and the outer,
Jovian planets. As we will see, long-standing ideas about planet formation have
been challenged by the properties of planets orbiting other stars.
</p>
<p>19.4.1 Temperature Structure
</p>
<p>The formation of planets within a protoplanetary disk will be influenced by the
temperature of the material out of which the planets form. We can predict how
temperature varies with position in any sort of accretion disk if we make the
following assumptions [1, 2]:
</p>
<p>1. The disk is roughly in equilibrium, so the amount of mass and the temperature at
a given position are nearly independent of time.
</p>
<p>2. Mass is flowing through the disk onto the star. Let Pm � dm=dt be the mass
accretion rate.
</p>
<p>3. The disk radiates as a blackbody.
4. The total mass in the disk is small compared with the mass of the star, so we can
</p>
<p>neglect the self-gravity of the disk.
</p>
<p>This model is clearly simplistic. It fails to describe the processes of planet formation
that are taking place within the disk. The disk must eventually disappear, so it
cannot truly be in equilibrium. The model does not specify how much mass flows
through the disk. Nevertheless, as we have often done in this chapter and throughout
the book, we will use a simplified model to uncover some important concepts and
scalings.
</p>
<p>Consider a narrow annulus of the disk extending from radius r to r C dr .
Imagine that a small packet of mass dm moves through the annulus, thus changing
its gravitational potential energy. For circular orbits (and, more generally, from the
virial theorem), half of the potential energy goes into the kinetic energy of motion
while the other half is released into the gas to be radiated away. The energy released
is thus</p>

</p>
<p>By assumption #1, this amount of energy must be radiated away to keep the disk in
equilibrium. By assumption #3, the energy is radiated as blackbody radiation. The
Stefan-Boltzmann law then says the luminosity from the annulus is the area times
�T 4. The area is 2�r dr , and there is another factor of 2 because radiation can leave
both the &ldquo;top&rdquo; and &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; of the disk. Thus, the luminosity from the annulus is

<p>L D 4�r � T 4 dr

</p>
<p>In our model, temperature decreases with radius in the disk with the scaling
</p>
<p>T / r�3=4
</p>
<p>Recall that this scaling describes heat generated gravitationally as material falls
through the disk toward the star. For comparison, in Sect. 13.2 we saw that heat
generated radiatively (i.e., direct heating by starlight) yields a shallower radial
dependence T / r�1=2.
</p>
<p>19.4.2 Picture of Planet Formation
</p>
<p>The temperature structure of a protoplanetary disk becomes important when we
consider what happens within the disk. Any small grains of ice or dust that happen
to exist will occasionally bump into each other and stick together. These seeds
will begin to pull in nearby material by gravity.3 As they grow larger, they will
collect more and more material, becoming planetesimals. Those planetesimals will
themselves collide and aggregate into planets.
</p>
<p>3We neglected the self gravity of the disk when modeling disk temperature in Sect. 19.4.1, but we
cannot neglect it when discussing how planets form.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>390 19 Star and Planet Formation
</p>
<p>The temperature structure determines what materials can participate in this
process. Based on our specific model of disk temperature, and on general physical
reasoning, we expect the inner region of a protoplanetary disk to be warm. Heavy
atoms and molecules (like rocky and metallic compounds) can condense into solid
grains, but light atoms and molecules (like hydrogen and water) cannot. As as result,
the main material that can participate in planet building here is rocks and metals&mdash;
the principal constituents of terrestrial planets.4
</p>
<p>Beyond some threshold in radius, which is known as the snow line or frost
line, water is able to condense into ice and join in the planet formation process. In
general there is more ice than rocks and metals in protoplanetary disks, so including
ice allows planetesimals to become much more massive. That, in turn, lets young
planets in the outer disk develop enough gravity to capture light gases like hydrogen
and helium. Since those two elements are so much more abundant than everything
else, any planet that can incorporate hydrogen and helium can become much more
massive than planets that only have rocks and metals.
</p>
<p>From Eq. (19.16) we see that the temperature scaling, and by extension the
location of the frost line, depends on both the mass of the central star and the
accretion rate in the protoplanetary disk. Even without knowing Pm, we can infer
that the frost line in our protoplanetary disk must have been somewhere between
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The story we have told then explains why the inner
planets are small and rocky while the outer planets are large and gaseous. But is
there any actual observational support for this story? Several pieces of evidence are
circumstantial but compelling:
</p>
<p>&bull; Impacts. Bodies such as the Moon and Mercury are covered with impact craters,
suggesting that collisions were common at some point in the past.
</p>
<p>&bull; Asteroids. These seem to be planetesimals that were not able to aggregate into a
planet.
</p>
<p>&bull; Moons. Some small moons could be planetesimals that got captured by a planet.
Some large moons (like our own) could have been created by a violent collision
between a planet and a big planetesimal.
</p>
<p>&bull; Rotation. Most of the planets rotate in the same direction as they orbit the Sun,
which makes sense if they grew in a spinning disk. However, Venus rotates
&ldquo;backward,&rdquo; and Uranus is tipped on its side. These unusual rotations could have
been produced by particularly violent collisions.
</p>
<p>In other words, the picture we have described seems to do a good job explaining the
general features of our Solar System. That is certainly reassuring, but perhaps not
surprising: theories of planet formation have presumably been tuned to agree with
</p>
<p>4Earth does have light molecules in the form of oceans and atmosphere, but they do not invalidate
the general argument because they constitute a tiny fraction of Earth&rsquo;s mass. Also, evidence from
isotopic ratios suggests that Earth received at least some of its water from planetesimals and comets
that formed farther out in the protoplanetary disk (see [8] and references therein).</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Problems 391
</p>
<p>what we observe. To test the theories we really need to consider other planetary
systems.
</p>
<p>That has been possible since about 1995, as the discovery of multitudes of planets
orbiting other stars has opened the &ldquo;era of comparative exoplanetology&rdquo; [9]. We
discussed exoplanets in Sect. 4.3. For our purposes here, a momentous discovery
was the existence of planets like Jupiter in orbits very close to their stars. For
example, the planet orbiting HD 209458 has a mass of 0:68MJ and a semimajor
axis of just 0:047AU. Not all exoplanets are such &ldquo;hot Jupiters,&rdquo; but enough of
them are that we need to understand how such objects came to be.
</p>
<p>It is hard to find fault with the idea that Jovian planets can only form in the outer
parts of a protoplanetary disk, beyond the frost line. So the hypothesis has emerged
that hot Jupiters formed in large orbits and then migrated into the small orbits
where they are found today. Gravitational interactions between a young planet and
the remnants of the protoplanetary disk could pull the planet toward the star [10].
While the general idea makes a lot of sense, there are still a number of issues to
understand in detail:
</p>
<p>&bull; Why did the planet stop at some specific, small radius? Why didn&rsquo;t it migrate all
the way into the star?
</p>
<p>&bull; Why did some Jovian planets move a long way while others did not? In particular,
why didn&rsquo;t Jupiter migrate very far?
</p>
<p>&bull; Were there other (Earth-like) planets in hot Jupiter systems? What happened to
them when the big planet migrated?
</p>
<p>&bull; What does all of this imply for the existence of habitable planets and the
possibility of extraterrestrial life?
</p>
<p>There are ideas about how to answer these questions, but so far no complete theory
that explains the full diversity of planetary systems. This is the subject of active
research, so stay tuned (e.g., [11]).
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>19.1. In Problem 12.6 you analyzed a uniform density star and found that the
pressure and temperature are not uniform. Compute the average temperature inside
the star and compare it with our expression for the virial temperature.
</p>
<p>19.2. Suppose a galaxy forms stars at an average rate of 1Mˇ yr�1 with a Salpeter
IMF (Eq. 19.6) in the range 0:1&ndash;100Mˇ. After the first �100Myr, the galaxy will
have a steady rate of type II supernovae from the deaths of stars more massive than
8Mˇ (see Sect. 16.4.2). What is the average time between supernovae? Hint: think
about the average number of new stars that form each year, and the fraction of
those that will explode; stellar lifetimes do not affect the answer as long as the star
formation and supernova rates are steady.</p>

<p>392 19 Star and Planet Formation
</p>
<p>19.3. The distribution of masses discussed in Sect. 19.1.3 is the initial mass
function. The distribution changes with time because stars with different masses
evolve at different rates (see Sect. 16.3). Let&rsquo;s make a simple model for main
sequence (MS) stars. Suppose the IMF is a power law dN=dM / M�˛ with
˛ � 2:35. Also suppose main sequence stars have a power law relation between
mass and luminosity, L / M ˇ with ˇ � 4 [12]. The luminosity reflects the rate at
which stars consume fuel, so the main sequence lifetime is roughly �MS / M=L /
M 1�ˇ. The proportionalities can be calibrated with respect to the Sun, which has
�MS;ˇ � 1010 yr. Finally, suppose a galaxy has been forming stars at a constant rate
PN for time �gal.
(a) At low masses, all the stars that ever formed are still on the main sequence. How
</p>
<p>does the number of MS stars scale with mass in this regime?
(b) At high masses, only stars that formed &ldquo;recently&rdquo; are still on the main sequence.
</p>
<p>How does the number of MS stars scale with mass in this regime?
(c) What mass marks the transition between the two regimes? How does the
</p>
<p>transition mass vary with time?
</p>
<p>19.4. Detailed studies of gas cooling are quite involved [7], but we can make a
simple model to understand the basic physics of the cooling function �. Consider
a gas cloud of mass M containing particles of mass m at temperature T . Low-
temperature gas cools when collisions excite rotational modes that decay and emit
light. Suppose the photon energy is E and the time between collisions is � . (We
assume the time for a rotational mode to decay is shorter than � .) Then the energy
loss rate per molecule is E=� , and the energy loss rate for the whole cloud is E=�
times the number of molecules.
</p>
<p>(a) Estimate the energy loss rate for the cloud. Hint: recall Sect. 12.1.4 and 13.4.4;
where necessary, assume the molecule has some characteristic size r0.
</p>
<p>(b) Write your answer from (a) in the same form as Eq. (19.9) and extract an
expression for � in our model. Apply the model to the example in Sect. 19.2.
Hint: the expression involvesm, T , and constants.
</p>
<p>(c) Our model so far assumes all particles contribute equally and all collisions
yield photons. In reality, cooling in low-temperature gas is dominated by carbon
monoxide even though CO is rare (an abundance of about 1 part in 104). How
does that affect our estimate of �? How does our final estimate compare with
the values quoted in Sect. 19.2?
</p>
<p>The model developed here is admittedly simplistic; it does not capture, for example,
how � depends on density in detailed calculations. Nevertheless, it serves the
purpose of a toy model, which is to identify the key physical principles.
</p>
<p>19.5. We said in Sect. 19.2 that ionization can absorb energy and allow a gas
cloud to shrink. Let&rsquo;s see how this affects a spherical cloud of hydrogen with total
massM .5
</p>
<p>5This question is inspired in part by an analysis in the book by Maoz [2].</p>

<p>Cosmology: Early Universe
</p>
<p>In Chap. 18 we saw how Cepheid stars and type Ia supernovae have been used to
measure the expansion of the universe. If we run the clock backward, we deduce
that in the past the universe was smaller, denser, and hotter than it is today. In this
chapter we use gas physics and particle physics to understand the early, hot phase of
the universe, and we discuss observations that probe this phase directly (through the
cosmic microwave background radiation) and indirectly (through the abundances of
elements created in the first few minutes after the big bang).
</p>
<p>20.1 Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
</p>
<p>When the universe was young, it was hot enough for gas to be ionized. The many
free electrons were very effective at scattering light, so the gas was optically thick
and photons were tightly coupled to matter. As the universe expanded and cooled,
the electrons and ions were able to come together to form neutral atoms. Suddenly
the photons were liberated, free to travel great distances through the universe. Those
photons are still around and visible as the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation.
</p>
<p>These ideas were initially developed in the late 1940s by Ralph Alpher, George
Gamow, and Robert Herman (see [1]), and later by Robert Dicke and Jim Peebles
(see [2]). In the early 1960s, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were working with
a new microwave antenna in Holmdel, NJ. They measured a low level of noise no
matter what direction they pointed the antenna, which persisted despite all efforts to
clean the antenna and eliminate sources of noise (including pigeons). They realized
the signal was consistent with blackbody radiation at a temperature �3K, but did
not know how to interpret such a signal. Eventually they heard that Dicke, Peebles,
and others at Princeton University had predicted microwave radiation from the early

together, and the rest is history [4,5]. Penzias and Wilson won the 1978 Nobel Prize
in Physics for their discovery of the CMB.
</p>
<p>20.1.1 Hot Big Bang
</p>
<p>We said the universe was hotter when it was younger, but to study the CMB we
need to quantify that statement. In Chap. 11 we discussed the theoretical framework
for describing the expansion of the universe. For our purposes here, there are two
key results. First, we characterize the expansion using the dimensionless scale factor
a.t/ such that distances scale as a and volumes scale as a3 relative to today. Second,
the expansion causes light waves to stretch, creating the cosmological redshift. From
Eqs. (11.19) and (11.20), the ratio of observed and emitted wavelengths is

</p>
<p>Suppose the universe today is filled with blackbody radiation with some temper-
ature T0. In the past, the wavelengths were all smaller by the factor a. What was the
corresponding temperature? From the Planck spectrum (Eq. 13.8), or equivalently
Wien&rsquo;s law (Eq. 13.13), wavelength and temperature are related by �T D constant,
which immediately implies

<p>(20.1)
</p>
<p>This allows us to characterize how the universe has cooled as it has expanded.
We also need to specify how the density has changed. Density times volume

conservation of mass implies

</p>
<p>20.1.2 Theory: Recombination Temperature
</p>
<p>As the universe expanded, two effects caused photons to decouple from matter. As
the density decreased, the photon&rsquo;s mean free path increased; at some point this
effect alone would have made the gas optically thin. But another process was also
underway: as the universe cooled, electrons and ions were able to combine to form
neutral atoms in a process known as recombination. The gas effectively became
transparent, leaving the universe filled with a bath of photons that are free but carry
a memory of the physical conditions of the universe at the time they were released.
</p>
<p>We can estimate the temperature of the universe at recombination,which helps us
understand the state of the universe that we study when we observe the CMB (also
see [6]). For simplicity, let&rsquo;s assume the universe was pure hydrogen. Let nb and
�b be the total number and mass density of baryons, which in a hydrogen universe
just means protons.3 LetX be the ionization fraction, so the number densities of free
electrons and ions are ne D ni D Xnb while the number density of neutral hydrogen
atoms is nH D .1 � X/nb . If the gas was in equilibrium, the Saha equation (14.3)
gives the ratio of ionized to neutral atoms to be

when characterizing the mass density of the universe. They are important when it comes to charge,
though.</p>

<p>This is a quadratic equation that we can solve to plotX as a function of temperature,
as shown in Fig. 20.1. According to this simple estimate, recombination should have
occurred between about 3;500 and 4;000K. More detailed analyses account for
the fact that a photon released when one atom combined could reionize a nearby
neutral atom, and place everything in an expanding universe (e.g., [7]). Those
analyses indicate that the temperature had to be a little lower, around 3;000K, for
recombination to be complete.4

<p>Mapping the CMB is a vital part of cosmology today. The first detailed maps were
obtained by the Cosmic BackgroundExplorer (COBE, launched in 1989). The CMB
spectrum measured by COBE (Fig. 20.2) matches a theoretical blackbody spectrum

transition temperature of�104 K. In the Sun, the higher density facilitates recombination.</p>

<p>phenomenally well; in fact, the CMB is the best blackbody known. This is the first
piece of evidence that we truly understand what was happening in the early universe
when the CMB was produced. COBE also found that the CMB is not quite uniform:
there are small anisotropies, or directions where the temperature is slightly warmer
or cooler than the average. George Smoot and John Mather won the 2006 Nobel
Prize in Physics for their discoveries with COBE.
</p>
<p>In the years since COBE, a number of instruments have been used to map
the CMB (see Fig. 20.3). The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP,
launched in 2001 [8]) observed the full sky with better resolution than COBE. The
ground-based Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT [9]) and South Pole Telescope
(SPT [10]) have produced maps that cover only a portion of the sky but have
even higher resolution than WMAP. The Planck spacecraft (launched in 2009 [11])
recently mapped the full sky at a resolution higher thanWMAP but not quite as high
as SPT and ACT.
</p>
<p>The anisotropies are small&mdash;less than 1 part in 10,000&mdash;but measurable. In a
map like Fig. 20.3, it is apparent that warmer and colder regions tend to have a
characteristic angular size. We quantify this effect in terms of the angular power
spectrum, shown in Fig. 20.4. Roughly speaking, you can think of creating a circle
with some particular angular size, computing the average temperature within that
circle, and then measuring the variations as you move the circle around the sky.
Repeating the process for circles with different sizes yields the power spectrum.
The CMB power spectrum shows a prominent peak at about 1ı, which is the main
scale visible in Fig. 20.3, but there are significant features on other scales as well.</p>

the power spectrum is computed in terms of the multipole moment `, indicated on the top axis.)
The vertical axis quantifies the amplitude of temperature fluctuations. Points with errorbars are
Planck measurements; the curve indicates a ƒCDM model fit to the data ( c&#13; ESA and the Planck
Collaboration [11])
</p>
<p>20.1.4 Implications
</p>
<p>The anisotropies in the CMB are important for two reasons. First, they represent
seeds from which galaxies grew. What we see as temperature fluctuations actually</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.2 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis 401
</p>
<p>correspond to variations in density. Overdensities create cold spots in the tempera-
ture map because photons lose energy as they climb out of a gravitational potential
well; this is known as the Sachs-Wolfe effect [12]. In places where the density
was a little higher than average, gravity was a little stronger, which tended to pull
in more matter from nearby, causing the overdensity to grow, making gravity even
stronger, drawing even more matter, and : : : well, you get the picture. There was a
runaway process that turned tiny overdensities into the large structures we see today
as galaxies and even clusters of galaxies. We know those all-important seeds were
there because we observe them in the CMB.
</p>
<p>Second, the anisotropies constrain the geometry and composition of the universe.
Before recombination, the material in the universe was governed by a fairly straight-
forward combination of gas physics and gravity. Over- and underdensities acted
as sound waves propagating through a nearly-uniform medium in an expanding
universe. The sound waves had a characteristic physical scale, which we can
compare with the measured angular scale to determine the geometry of the universe.
Also, the power spectrum of fluctuations depended on the relative abundances of
normal matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe. Although we will not
delve into the details, it is possible to predict the CMB power spectrum for different
assumptions about the composition of the universe. Adjusting the predictions to
match the data (as shown by the curve in Fig. 20.4) yields strong constraints on
cosmological parameters. (See [13] for a full discussion of cosmological constraints
from Planck.) Constraints from the CMB and other datasets are shown in Fig. 11.6.
It is striking is that three very different ways of probing the universe yield consistent
results. Even if we do not yet know what dark matter and dark energy are, we think
we know how much of each substance the universe contains.
</p>
<p>20.2 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
</p>
<p>The CMB provides direct access to the physical state of the universe when it was
about 380,000 years old. We can reach back even further&mdash;to when the universe
was only a few minutes old&mdash;by using the idea that the very young universe was a
nuclear reactor.
</p>
<p>20.2.1 Theory: &ldquo;The First Three Minutes&rdquo;
</p>
<p>When the universe was young and hot, it was filled with a sea of elementary
particles: protons, neutrons, electrons, positrons, neutrinos, antineutrinos, and
photons. Why not anti-protons and anti-neutrons? This is the unsolved question of
baryogenesis: why is there a (slight) asymmetry favoring matter over antimatter in
our universe? If there were exact symmetry between matter and antimatter, there
would have been equal numbers of baryons and anti-baryons in the early universe,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>402 20 Cosmology: Early Universe
</p>
<p>and they would have annihilated to leave a universe filled only with photons. Particle
physicists are still trying to understand the origin of the asymmetry, but for our
purposes we simply accept that there is matter in the universe and attempt to
understand how the density of matter affects things we can measure.
</p>
<p>Early on, the temperature and density were high enough to allow reactions among
the particles5:
</p>
<p>nC eC &bull; p C N�e (20.5a)
nC �e &bull; p C e� (20.5b)
</p>
<p>n&bull; p C e� C N�e (20.5c)
</p>
<p>How high did the temperature have to be for such reactions to occur? The neutron
weighs a little more than the proton, so there is a Boltzmann factor that describes
their relative numbers (in thermodynamic equilibrium):
</p>
<p>Nn
</p>
<p>Np
� e�.mn�mp/c2=kT
</p>
<p>The mass difference corresponds to energy difference
</p>
<p>&#129;Enp D .mn �mp/c2 D 1:29MeV
</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, then, protons and neutrons could be in thermodynamic equilib-
rium only when
</p>
<p>kT &amp; 1:29MeV ) T &amp; 1:5 � 1010K
</p>
<p>As the universe cooled, two things happened. First, the &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; reactions slowed
down and protons began to outnumber neutrons. Second, while the protons and neu-
trons were doing their thing, electron/positron pairs were forming and annihilating:
</p>
<p>e� C eC &bull; 2&#13;
</p>
<p>Electrons and positrons each have a mass of 0:51MeV, so this reaction could occur
only when
</p>
<p>kT &amp; 1:02MeV ) T &amp; 1:2 � 1010K
</p>
<p>Once the temperature fell below about 1MeV, it was no longer possible to form
new electron/positron pairs. As existing pairs annihilated, the decreasing number
of electrons made it harder to form neutrons (see Eqs. 20.5b and 20.5c). When all
the details are taken into account, it turns out that the above reactions ceased when
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.2 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis 403
</p>
<p>the temperature cooled to about 0:8MeV. This is called neutron freezeout, and it
(momentarily) fixed the relative abundance of protons and neutrons to be
</p>
<p>Nn
</p>
<p>Np
� e�1:3MeV=0:8MeV � 0:20
</p>
<p>I say &ldquo;momentarily&rdquo; because free neutrons spontaneously decay by the process in
Eq. (20.5c), with a half-life of just 615 s. The remaining neutrons did begin to decay,
and the neutron/proton ratio fell to
</p>
<p>Nn
</p>
<p>Np
� 1
7
</p>
<p>(20.6)
</p>
<p>Another process kicked in once the temperature cooled to about 0.1MeV:
neutrons could combine with protons to form deuterium,
</p>
<p>nC p ! 21HC &#13;
</p>
<p>Neutrons that are bound into nuclei are stable, so this was a key step that locked
in the (primordial) abundance of neutrons. Once deuterium formed, it could go
through various reactions to create helium-4 (see, e.g., [16]). One channel involves
hydrogen-3,
</p>
<p>2
1HC 21H ! 31HC p
3
1HC 21H ! 42HeC n
</p>
<p>while another involves helium-3,
</p>
<p>2
1HC p ! 32HeC &#13;
2
1HC 21H ! 32HeC n
3
2HeC 21H ! 42HeC p
</p>
<p>The process could even produce a little lithium and beryllium:
</p>
<p>4
2HeC 31H ! 73LiC &#13;
4
2HeC 32He ! 74BeC &#13;
</p>
<p>It is possible to work out the reaction rates in detail, taking into account the
expansion and cooling, and thus predict the abundances of different elements as
a function of time. Figure 20.5 shows the results and reveals two important points.
First, all of the action occurred when the universe was just a few hundred seconds
old. This is reflected in the title of a famous book by Steven Weinberg about the
formation of the elements: The First Three Minutes [18].</p>

<p>Fig. 20.5 Predicted
abundances of light elements
as a function of time in the
early universe (&ldquo;p&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo;
indicate protons and neutrons,
respectively). The vertical
axis is mass fraction; note the
enormous range reflected in
the logarithmic scale (Credit:
Coc et al. [17]. Reproduced
by permission of the AAS)
</p>
<p>Second, the binding energy of helium-4 makes it very stable (recall our discus-
sion of fusion in Chap. 15), so the vast majority of neutrons wound up in helium-4.
We can estimate the mass fraction of helium-4 in the primordial gas as follows. Each
helium-4 nucleus has 2 neutrons. From (20.6), there must be about 14 protons for
those 2 neutrons. Two of the protons are in the helium-4 with the neutrons, leaving
12 protons left over. Thus, there are about 12 hydrogens for every helium. If we
consider the mass fraction that is in helium, we have
</p>
<p>MHe
</p>
<p>MH CMHe
� 1 � 4mp
12 �mp C 1 � 4mp
</p>
<p>� 4
16
</p>
<p>� 0:25
</p>
<p>In other words, we predict that about 25% of the mass of the primordial gas
was helium (and almost all the rest was hydrogen). This follows directly from
the neutron/proton ratio and is not very sensitive to other details of the nuclear
processes.
</p>
<p>While most of the deuterium and helium-3 went into helium-4, small amounts
stuck around. It is possible to analyze the reactions and predict the relative
abundances of all the different elements. The results depend, not surprisingly, on the
total density of baryons in the universe, specifically in the combination˝bh2 where
h D H0=.100 kms�1Mpc�1/ is a dimensionless version of the Hubble constant.</p>

</p>
<p>20.2.2 Observations: Primordial Abundances
</p>
<p>With predictions in hand, we would like to test them observationally. The challenge
is figuring out how to uncover the primordial abundances of elements, because much
of the gas in the universe has been &ldquo;polluted&rdquo; by the lives and deaths of stars in the
13.8 billion years since big bang nucleosynthesis.</p>

redshifted to the observed wavelength .1 C zQ/1;216&Aring; D 4;425&Aring;. The &ldquo;forest&rdquo; of absorption
lines at shorter wavelengths correspond to gas clouds between us and the quasar. A cloud at redshift
z produces a Ly-˛ absorption line at wavelength .1 C z/1;216&Aring; (Credit: O&rsquo;Meara et al. [25].

</p>
<p>With a primordial mass fraction of about 25%, helium-4 would seem to be
the easiest element to measure. But helium-4 is also created by fusion in stars.
Most stars produce oxygen before they die and release their helium-4 back into
the interstellar medium (see Sect. 16.3), so one strategy has been to measure
the abundance of helium-4 in gas clouds that contain very little oxygen. Such
measurements imply that primordial gas does have an abundance of helium-4 that
matches predictions from big bang nucleosynthesis (see [24] for a review).
</p>
<p>To probe elements that are more rare, one trick is to look far away, and therefore
back in time. If we are hunting for gas that does not contain stars, we cannot rely on
emission of light from the gas; instead, we search for absorption of light that passes
through the gas. Quasars provide ideal &ldquo;flashlights&rdquo; for this experiment, because
they are distant&mdash;creating a good chance that the light passed through a gas cloud
when the universe was younger&mdash;yet bright enough to observe. (The most distant
quasars date from when the universe was only�1Gyr old.) High-resolution spectra
of quasars indeed reveal a &ldquo;forest&rdquo; of absorption lines from gas clouds that lie along
the intervening line of sight, as shown in Fig. 20.7. Zooming in on different portions
of the spectrum, we can identify all the different lines in the Lyman series that are
produced by a single gas cloud, as shown in Fig. 20.8.
</p>
<p>We can use such spectra to search for deuterium. The electron shell structure is
similar to that of hydrogen, but the presence of a neutron in the nucleus perturbs
the energy levels and shifts the absorption to slightly shorter wavelengths than in
hydrogen. With a high-quality spectrum, it is possible to distinguish the deuterium
lines from the hydrogen lines (see Fig. 20.8), and thus to measure the abundance of
deuterium relative to hydrogen in the distant gas cloud. If we find similar deuterium
abundances in a variety of systems, we can infer that it reflects the primordial
abundance.</p>

<p>Fig. 20.8 Close-up of various absorption lines in the spectrum from Fig. 20.7. To put the panels
on a common scale, wavelength offsets have been converted to velocity offsets using &#129;v D c &#129;�.
The absorption lines shown here are all part of the Lyman series produced by a single gas cloud. In
several lines (notably Ly-ˇ through Ly-6) there is clear evidence of absorption by deuterium just
blueward of the absorption by hydrogen (Credit: O&rsquo;Meara et al. [25]. Reproduced by permission
of the AAS)
</p>
<p>There are ways to recover the primordial abundances of helium-3 and lithium-7
as well, as discussed by Weiss [24]. The measurements are indicated by the hori-
zontal bands in Fig. 20.6. For deuterium, helium-3, and helium-4, the measurements
agree well with the theoretical predictions for the value of ˝bh2 inferred from
Planck observations of the CMB. In other words, for these three elements at least,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>408 20 Cosmology: Early Universe
</p>
<p>we seem to have a consistent picture of what the universe was doing when it was
just a few minutes old. Curiously, the measured abundance of lithium-7 is a little
lower than expected for the relevant value of ˝bh2, and we do not yet know what
to make of that result. It is thought that lithium-7 might be easier to destroy than
other elements, which could explain the low measured abundance. But it is also
possible that some &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; processes in the early universe could have modified
the production of lithium-7 [26]. Either way, we should learn something interesting
from the discrepancy between theory and observations.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the lithium problem, the overall picture suggests that we have
a remarkably good understanding of what the universe was like in the first few
minutes after the big bang. Together, the CMB and BBN provide exceedingly strong
evidence that normal matter makes up a small fraction of the universe, and that the
universe is dominated by two exotic substances about which we still have much to
learn.
</p>
<p>20.3 How Did We Get Here?
</p>
<p>This brings to a close our story of how the elements were created: inside stars, and
in the early universe. Combining that with our understanding of gas (for the CMB)
and stars (especially type Ia supernovae), we can assemble a fairly detailed census
of the contents of the universe: today the universe contains about 5% normal matter,
27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy. And with our knowledge of (astro)physics
we can reconstruct the history of the universe. To recap: the composition of the
primordial gas was determined when the universe was about 3min old. The gas
went through recombination when the universe was around 380,000 years old, and
we can observe this with the CMB. In the intervening 13.8 billion years, large
gas clouds collapsed under the influence of gravity to become galaxies. Within
galaxies, smaller clouds cooled and collapsed to form stars. Inside stars, the density,
temperature, and pressure rose to the point that nuclear fusion could begin, releasing
energy and creating all the elements heavier than hydrogen, helium, and lithium. At
the end of their lives, those stars released heavy elements to the interstellar medium,
where they could be incorporated into new stars and planets. Our planet and our
bodies are made from elements forged by nuclear fusion in earlier generations of
stars; and our lives today are powered by fusion in the Sun. What is even more
remarkable than the story itself, I think, is that we can use physical principles to
figure it all out. I hope you have enjoyed the journey!

<p>Technical Background
</p>
<p>A.1 Cartesian and Polar Coordinates
</p>
<p>We often study motion that is confined to a plane (e.g., orbits in a spherically
symmetric gravitational field), so it is worthwhile to review 2-d coordinate systems.
In standard Cartesian coordinates the position vector is written as
</p>
<p>r D x Ox C y Oy
</p>
<p>(Alternate notations include r D rx OxC ry Oy D x OiCy Oj D x OexCy Oey .) Here Ox and
Oy are unit vectors, which means their lengths are jOxj D jOyj D 1.
</p>
<p>If an object moves in two dimensions as a function of time, we can describe its
motion as r.t/ D x.t/ Ox C y.t/ Oy. In Cartesian coordinates, the unit vectors are
independent of position and hence independent of time, so we can write the velocity
and acceleration vectors as
</p>
<p>v � dr
dt
</p>
<p>D dx
dt
</p>
<p>Ox C dy
dt
</p>
<p>Oy
</p>
<p>a � dv

</p>
<p>D d
2x
</p>
<p>dt2
Ox C d
</p>
<p>2y
</p>
<p>dt2
Oy
</p>
<p>There are no surprises or complications when the unit vectors are constant.
We can also write the position vector in polar coordinates, in which we specify
</p>
<p>the object&rsquo;s radius r and azimuthal angle � as shown in Fig. A.1. The angle is
defined to go counterclockwise by convention. From trigonometry, we have
</p>
<p>x D r cos� and y D r sin �

Cartesian and polar
coordinates in two
dimensions. For point A, the
polar coordinates .r; �/ are
indicated. The Cartesian unit
vectors Ox and Oy are shown
with solid arrows, while the
polar unit vectors Or and O� are
shown with dashed arrows.
For point B , the Cartesian
unit vectors are the same but
the polar unit vectors are
different
</p>
<p>along with the inverse relations

<p>r D

</p>
<p>and � D tan�1 y

</p>
<p>We can define unit vectors in polar coordinates, which are also shown in Fig. A.1.
The radial unit vector, Or, always points away from the origin:
</p>
<p>Or D r
r
</p>
<p>, r D r Or
</p>
<p>The angular unit vector, O�, is perpendicular to Or and defined to point in the direction
in which � increases (i.e., counterclockwise). Expressing the polar unit vectors in
Cartesian coordinates gives
</p>
<p>Or D cos� Ox C sin � Oy and O� D � sin� Ox C cos� Oy
</p>
<p>Because the polar unit vectors depend on position, they change with time as an
object moves:
</p>
<p>dOr
dt
</p>
<p>D � sin � d�
dt
</p>
<p>Ox C cos� d�

dt
</p>
<p>Ox � sin � d�
dt
</p>
<p>Oy D �d�
dt
</p>
<p>Or
</p>
<p>This makes sense: because their lengths are fixed, the unit vectors can only change
direction, so the derivative of each unit vector is perpendicular to that unit vector.
</p>
<p>We can now define the velocity and acceleration vectors in polar coordinates.
The velocity is fairly straightforward:
</p>
<p>v � dr
dt
</p>
<p>D dr

</p>
<p>Or C r dOr

<p>A.2 Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates
</p>
<p>To generalize polar coordinates to three dimensions, one option is to keep polar
coordinates in the .x; y/ plane and add a simple Cartesian component in the z
direction. This leads to cylindrical coordinates .R; �; z/, as shown in the left
panel of Fig.A.2. Here OR and O� behave just like the unit vectors in basic polar

</p>
<p>Fig. A.2 The left panel illustrates cylindrical coordinates .R; �; z/while the right panel illustrates
spherical coordinates .r; �; �/. In both cases, the azimuthal angle � is measured in the .x; y/ plane.
In cylindrical coordinates, R is also measured in the .x; y/ plane, and z is perpendicular to the
plane. In spherical coordinates, r is the distance from the origin to the point, and � is the polar
angle measured from the z-axis</p>

<p>coordinates, while Oz is constant. We can therefore write down the position, velocity,
and acceleration vectors:

<p>OR CRd�

</p>
<p>Another option is to keep a single length variable and use two angular variables.
This yields spherical coordinates .r; �; �/, as shown in the right panel of Fig. A.2.
By convention, � still measures the azimuthal angle in the sense of rotation around
the z-axis, while � measures the angle with the z-axis (so it is akin to latitude on
Earth&rsquo;s surface). The conversion between spherical and Cartesian coordinates is
</p>
<p>x D r sin � cos� y D r sin � sin � z D r cos �
</p>
<p>An analysis similar to that in Sect. A.1 yields the following expressions for the
position, velocity, and acceleration vectors:

<p>A.3 Rotating Reference Frame
</p>
<p>Consider a coordinate system .x0; y0; z0/ that is a rotating version of some stationary
reference frame .x; y; z/. The rotation axis is fixed, but the rotation rate may be
variable. Without loss of generality we can define Oz D Oz0 to be the axis of rotation.
Then we can write the unit vectors in the rotating frame as
</p>
<p>Ox0 D cos�.t/ Ox C sin �.t/ Oy
Oy0 D � sin�.t/ Ox C cos�.t/ Oy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A.3 Rotating Reference Frame 417
</p>
<p>where �.t/ is the phase angle between the two frames at time t . The derivatives of
these are
</p>
<p>dOx0
</p>
<p>dt
D �! sin�.t/ Ox C ! cos�.t/ Oy D ! Oy0 (A.1)
</p>
<p>dOy0
</p>
<p>dt
D �! cos�.t/ Ox � ! sin �.t/ Oy D �! Ox0 (A.2)
</p>
<p>where ! D d�=dt is the angular frequency of rotation. It is useful to define the
angular frequency vector&#127; so it points along the rotation axis and has a magnitude
equal to the angular frequency at which the axes rotate: in our setup,&#127; D ! Oz.
</p>
<p>Given some general vector Q, we can write its components in both the fixed and
rotating frames,
</p>
<p>Q D Qx Ox CQy Oy CQz Oz D Q0x Ox0 CQ0y Oy0 CQ0z Oz0
</p>
<p>(With z as the rotation axis, Q0z D Qz and Oz
0 D Oz.) The time derivative can be
</p>
<p>written in the fixed frame as
</p>
<p>dQ
</p>
<p>dt
D dQx
</p>
<p>dt
Ox C dQy
</p>
<p>dt
Oy C dQz
</p>
<p>dt
Oz
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s identify this as .dQ=dt/fixed. Now consider the rotating reference frame:
</p>
<p>dQ
</p>
<p>dt
D
 
</p>
<p>dQ0x
dt
</p>
<p>Ox0 C

<p>dOy0
</p>
<p>dt
CQ0z
</p>
<p>dOz0
</p>
<p>dt
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>The first set of terms are what we would call .dQ=dt/rot, the derivative with respect
to the rotating coordinates. The second set of terms can be rewritten using Eqs. (A.1)
and (A.2) to obtain
</p>
<p>dQ

<p>dt
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>rot
C&#127; � Q
</p>
<p>using the properties of the vector cross product. Since the left-hand side is the same
as .dQ=dt/fixed, we can think of the derivative operator as
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
</p>

</p>
<p>rot
C&#127;�</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>418 A Technical Background
</p>
<p>Now if we let Q be the position vector r, we have
</p>
<p>vfixed D vrot C&#127; � r
</p>
<p>Taking the derivative of this yields
</p>
<p>�
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>fixed

</p>
<p>dr
</p>
<p>dt
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>rot
C&#127; � .&#127; � r/
</p>
<p>The first term is the acceleration with respect to the rotating frame. Since .dr=dt/rot
is the velocity in the rotating frame, the fourth term is the same as the second.
Collecting and identifying terms gives
</p>
<p>afixed D arot C&#127; � .&#127; � r/C 2&#127;� vrot C
d&#127;
</p>
<p>dt
� r (A.3)
</p>
<p>The physical interpretation of the various terms is discussed in Sect. 6.1.1.
</p>
<p>A.4 Angular Momentum
</p>
<p>At various places in the book we encounter conservation of angular momentum as
applied to an individual particle. As a reminder, a particle&rsquo;s angular momentum is
</p>
<p>L D r � p D m r � v
</p>
<p>For a circular orbit, v is perpendicular to r so this reduces to
</p>
<p>L D mr v D mr2 !
</p>
<p>where ! D v=r is the angular speed of the orbit.
How do we generalize to an object with a finite size? Consider a sphere with
</p>
<p>massM and radius R. Suppose it is rotating in solid body rotation, so all parts of
the sphere rotate with the same period and hence the same angular speed. A particle
with spherical coordinates .r; �; �/ moves in a circle of radius r sin � . The total
angular momentum is obtained by adding up the contributions of all the individual
particles:
</p>
<p>L D
Z
</p>
<p>V
</p>
<p>� .r sin �/2 ! dV D !
Z R
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>dr r4
Z �
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>d� sin3 �
Z 2�
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>d� �.r; �; �/
</p>
<p>where we use the spherical volume element dV D r2 sin � dr d� d�, and we pull
out ! because it is constant. If the sphere has uniform density we can also pull out
� and then evaluate the integrals:</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>5
MR2 !
</p>
<p>where we useM D .4=3/�R3�. Finally, we note that the factor of ! just depends
on how fast the sphere is spinning, while the factor of .2=5/MR2 depends only on
the structure of the sphere. We collect the structure-dependent pieces and write
</p>
<p>L D I!
</p>
<p>where I is the moment of inertia. For a uniform density sphere of mass M and
radiusR, the moment of inertia is
</p>
<p>I D 2
5
MR2
</p>
<p>Other geometries would give different values for the moment of inertia.
</p>
<p>A.5 Taylor Series Approximation
</p>
<p>If we need to study some complicated function f .x/ but are mainly interested in
its behavior over some &ldquo;small&rdquo; region, we can obtain a useful approximation by
making a Taylor series expansion. Recall that to expand f .x/ around some value
x D a, we write
</p>
<p>f .x/ � f .a/ C f 0.a/ .x � a/ C 1
2
f 00.a/ .x � a/2 C O
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>.x � a/3
�
</p>
<p>where f 0.a/ is the first derivative of the function, evaluated at x D a, while f 00.a/
is the second derivative, and so forth. If we can write the function in a form such
that a D 0, then we have
</p>
<p>f .x/ � f .0/ C f 0.0/ x C 1
2
f 00.0/ x2 C O
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>x3
�
</p>
<p>Example. We often see functions of the form
</p>
<p>f .x/ D .1C x/˛
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s evaluate the derivatives:
</p>
<p>f 0.x/ D ˛.1C x/˛�1
</p>
<p>f 00.x/ D ˛.˛ � 1/.1C x/˛�2</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>420 A Technical Background
</p>
<p>The Taylor series approximation is therefore
</p>
<p>f .x/ � 1 C ˛ x C 1
2
˛.˛ � 1/x2 C O
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>x3
�
</p>
<p>The approximation .1C x/˛ � 1C ˛x is one we use a lot.
</p>
<p>A.6 Numerical Solution of Differential Equations
</p>
<p>If we face a differential equation that is difficult or impossible to solve with pencil
and paper, we can turn to numerical techniques. Consider a differential equation of
the form
</p>
<p>df
</p>
<p>dt
D g.t/
</p>
<p>We can rewrite the left-hand side as
</p>
<p>f .t C&#129;t/ � f .t/
&#129;t
</p>
<p>� g.t/
</p>
<p>if &#129;t is sufficiently small. Rearranging, we can write:
</p>
<p>f .t C&#129;t/ � f .t/C g.t/&#129;t
</p>
<p>Suppose as an initial condition we know f .t1/. Then we can take a series of steps:
</p>
<p>f .t2/ � f .t1/C g.t1/.t2 � t1/
f .t3/ � f .t2/C g.t2/.t3 � t2/
f .t4/ � f .t3/C g.t3/.t4 � t3/
</p>
<p>:::
</p>
<p>f .tiC1/ � f .ti /C g.ti /.tiC1 � ti /
</p>
<p>If the steps are small, the approximations are good enough to give something close
to the right answer. Taking a long series of small steps is tedious by hand but
manageable by computer.
</p>
<p>This approach can be extended to handle a system of differential equations. For
example, if we have two equations
</p>
<p>df1
dt
</p>
<p>D g1.t/ and
df2
dt
</p>
<p>D g2.t/</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A.7 Useful Integrals 421
</p>
<p>then we can write the solution as
</p>
<p>f1.tiC1/ � f1.ti /C g1.ti /.tiC1 � ti / and f2.tiC1/ � f2.ti /C g2.ti /.tiC1 � ti /
</p>
<p>and so on for as many time steps as desired. The generalization to three or more
equations is straightforward.
</p>
<p>So far we have considered first-order differential equations, but we can generalize
to second-order equations through a &ldquo;trick.&rdquo; Consider a second-order equation of the
form
</p>
<p>d2x
</p>
<p>dt2
D a.t/
</p>
<p>If we take not only the position x but also the velocity v to be dependent variables,
we can write the second-order equation as a pair of coupled first-order equations:
</p>
<p>dx
</p>
<p>dt
D v.t/ and dv
</p>
<p>dt
D a.t/
</p>
<p>This pair of equations can be solved as above.
There is an important subtlety here: computers have finite precision, and with

<p>a large number of steps the numerical error can build up. Keeping the steps
small enough to make the approximations valid but large enough to control
numerical errors may require a delicate balance. In addition, the equations and/or
boundary conditions may have intrinsic difficulties in certain problems. A variety
of algorithms have therefore been developed for solving differential equations
computationally (see, e.g., [1]).

<p>A.7 Useful Integrals
</p>
<p>Here is a compilation of integrals, some of which appear at various places in the
text. The integrals can be evaluated by consulting a reference book (e.g., [2]) or
using software such as Mathematica [3]. Most of these are expressed as indefinite
integrals, which have an arbitrary constant of integration that is omitted here to avoid
clutter. First consider integrals of the form:
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>x
</p>
<p>1C x dx D x � ln.1C x/
Z
</p>
<p>x
</p>
<p>.1C x/2 dx D
1
</p>
<p>1C x C ln.1C x/</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>422 A Technical Background
</p>
<p>Next consider similar integrals with x2 instead of x:
</p>

</p>
<p>.1C x2/1=2 dx D

<p>.1C x2/3=2 dx D �

<p>Z
</p>
<p>x2
</p>
<p>.1C x2/5=2 dx D
x3
</p>
<p>3.1C x2/3=2
</p>
<p>Here are a few other integrals that may be useful:
</p>
<p>Z
</p>
<p>� x
</p>
<p>1 � x
�1=2
</p>
<p>dx D � Œx.1 � x/&#141;1=2 C sin�1 x1=2

</p>
<p>48.1C x2/3 C

</p>
<p>16

</p>
<p>Finally, here are definite integrals with a Gaussian integrand:
</p>
<p>Z 1

<p>2=.2�2/ dx D .2�/1=2�
