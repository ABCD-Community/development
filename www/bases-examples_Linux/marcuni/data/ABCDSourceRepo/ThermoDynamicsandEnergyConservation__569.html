<p>Preface
</p>
<p>This textbook grew out of lecture notes for the thermodynamics courses
offered in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Victoria. Writing my own notes forced me to thoroughly consider how, in
my subjective view, engineering thermodynamics should be taught. At the
same time I aimed for a concise presentation, with the material of three
courses delivered on about 600 pages.1 My hope in publishing this book is
that students of thermodynamics might find the chosen approach accessible,
and maybe illuminating, and discover thermodynamics and its interesting
applications for themselves.
</p>
<p>Probably the biggest difference to standard texts is when and how the
second law of thermodynamics and its central quantity, the entropy, are in-
troduced. The second law describes irreversible processes like friction and
heat transfer, which are related to a loss in work. For instance, work that
is needed to overcome friction in a generator cannot be converted into elec-
tricity, hence there is a loss. Accordingly, it should be one of the main goals
of a thermal engineer to reduce irreversibility as much as possible. Indeed,
the desire to understand and quantify irreversible losses is one of the central
themes of the present treatment, it is touched upon in almost all chapters.
</p>
<p>The emphasis on irreversibilities requires the introduction of the second law
as early as possible. The classical treatment, which is still used in most texts
on engineering thermodynamics, is to derive the second law from discussion
on thermal engines with and without losses. Obviously, this requires an exten-
sive discussion of thermodynamic processes and thermal engines by means of
the first law of thermodynamics&mdash;the law of conservation of energy&mdash;before
the second law can even be mentioned. In the present treatment, entropy and

<p>1 The courses (13 weeks à 3 hours), and the relevant book chapters, as currently
taught at the University of Victoria, are:
Thermodynamics (UVic Mech 240): Chapters 1-10
Energy Conversion (UVic Mech 390): Chapters 11-14, 18.1-18.9, 19,
23.1-23.5, 24
Advanced Thermodynamics (UVic Mech 443): Chapters 16-18, 20-26</p>
<p/>

<p>VI Preface
</p>
<p>the second law are introduced directly after the first law, based on observa-
tions of rather simple processes, in particular the trend of unmanipulated
systems to approach a unique equilibrium state. With this, the complete set
of thermodynamic laws is available almost immediately, and the discussion of
all thermodynamic processes and engines relies on both laws from the start.
All considerations on engines which are typically used to derive the second
law, are now a result of the analysis of the engines by means of the first and
second law.
</p>
<p>As soon as the thermodynamic laws are stated we are in calmer waters.
The discussion of property relations, processes in closed and open systems,
thermodynamic cycles, mixtures and so on follows established practice, only,
perhaps, with the additional emphasis on irreversibility and loss. Some el-
ements that might not be found in other books on engineering thermody-
namics concern the microscopic definition of entropy, the afore mentioned
emphasis on thermodynamic losses, and the detailed discussion of a number
of advanced energy conversion systems such as Atkinson engine, solar tower
(updraft power plant), turbo-fan air engine, ramjet and scramjet, compressed
air energy storage, osmotic power plants, carbon sequestration, phase and
chemical equilibrium, or fuel cells. The principles of non-equilibrium thermo-
dynamics are used to derive transport laws such as Newton&rsquo;s law of cooling,
Darcy&rsquo;s law for flow through porous media, and activation losses in fuel cells.
</p>
<p>There are about 300 end-of-chapter problems for homework assignments
and exams. The problems were chosen in order to emphasize all important
concepts and processes. They are accompanied by detailed solved examples
in all chapters, and it is recommended to first study the examples and then
tackle the problems. Many problems require the use of thermodynamic prop-
erty tables, which are widely available in print and online.
</p>
<p>Any presentation of a large topic such as thermodynamics can never be
complete. The choice of topics in this book is a personal one, but I am
confident that after studying this book the reader will find easy access to
most other thermodynamics texts, be they written for mechanical engineers,
chemical engineers, or scientists. Thermodynamics and Energy Conversion
processes will remain an important part of modern civilization. High energy
efficiency can only be obtained from a deep understanding of the Laws of
Thermodynamics, which describe the interplay of Energy, Entropy, and Ef-
ficiency. It is my sincere hope that this book will contribute to this end.

<p>My view on thermodynamics has evolved over the years, and I benefitted
from discussions with many colleagues and friends, in particular: my teacher
Prof. Ingo Müller (Technical University of Berlin, Germany), Prof. Manuel
Torrilhon (RWTH Aachen University, Germany), Prof. Hans Christian
Öttinger (ETH Zürich, Switzerland), Profs. Signe Kjelstrup and Dick Be-
deaux (NTNU Trondheim, Norway).
</p>
<p>All chapters of this book went through several runs of the respective course,
and each re-run led to additions and deletions, changes and adjustments, more
examples and new problems. For feedback, corrections, and, sometimes, criti-
cal praise I would like to thank the countless students that went through these
courses, as well as the graduate students that served as teaching assistants.
</p>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Victoria
provides a wonderfully collegial atmosphere for which I express my heartfelt
thanks to my colleagues.
</p>
<p>Finally, I thank my wife, Martina, and our daughter, Nora, for their con-
tinuous support, understanding, and love.</p>

<p>Introduction: Why Thermodynamics?
</p>
<p>1.1 Energy and Work in Our World
</p>
<p>Mechanical and electrical work is what drives our daily lives: cars, trucks,
planes, trains, ships&mdash;in short, all transport&mdash;require motors which are ei-
ther based on combustion of fuel or on electric energy. Our home and work
environments are unthinkable without the many devices that are powered
by electricity: light, microwave and stove, freezer and refrigerator, television
and radio, DVD and bluray, CD and MP3 player, smartphone and telephone
landline, computer and printer, washer and dryer, air conditioning and (some-
times) heat, power drill and lawn mower; the list goes on. Hospitals and fac-
tories are filled to the rim with mechanical and electronic devices and robots
that are driven by electrical energy.
</p>
<p>Electricity, however, is mainly obtained by converting mechanical work
into electrical work in a generator: our lifestyle requires an endless supply of
mechanical work.
</p>
<p>For most of its history, humankind was only able to harvest mechanical
work as nature provided it. Wind and water wheels were used not only to mill
grain, but also for other purposes, most importantly for pumping irrigation
water.1 But else, there was little, and an abundance of tasks had to be done
by human labor: farming, e.g., harvesting with a scythe, and weaving with a
loom come to mind immediately.
</p>
<p>Heat, as obtained from combustion of wood, fat, oil or coal, however, was
used for cooking, lighting and heating, and other tasks unrelated to mechan-
ical work, most importantly probably the smelting of metals.
</p>
<p>The industrial revolution was triggered in the 18th century by the invention
of heat engines, that is engines that convert heat into work. In particular the
development of the steam engine by engineers like James Watt led to the
lifestyle we enjoy. Now a wide array of heat engines is available. The original
</p>
<p>1 Today, wind turbines and large hydropower dams harvest the same natural powers
to directly produce electricity.

<p>2 1 Introduction: Why Thermodynamics?
</p>
<p>piston steam engines are replaced by steam turbines, while piston engines
such as the Diesel and Otto engines are omnipresent on our streets and in
ships, gas turbines drive aircraft and run in power plants.
</p>
<p>For all engines, the heat is typically created by the burning of a fuel, such
as coal, natural gas, oil, etc., or from nuclear power. The fuel is costly, and
scarce, and therefore one will aim to make heat engines as efficient as possible.
Moreover, combustion of fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,
which impacts global climate. More efficient use of fuels can at least slow down
the rate at which carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere, and hence high
efficiencies have more than pecuniary value.
</p>
<p>Thermodynamics was developed out of the desire to understand the limits
of heat engine efficiency. Modern power plants run on intricate improvements
on the original steam engine process that result from the deeper understand-
ing of thermodynamic processes. Early steam engines had efficiencies of heat
to work conversion of only a few percent, while modern combined cycle gas
turbine/steam power plants exhibit efficiencies of up to 60%. Moreover, ther-
modynamic consideration can establish absolute upper bounds on efficiencies
for processes, answering questions such as: how much work can be obtained
at best from a heat source at a given temperature? or: what is the maximum
work that could be obtained from a given amount of fuel? Only comparing ac-
tual performance against these theoretical limits can give adequate measures
of efficiency. Of course, these questions and the answers will be discussed
throughout this book.
</p>
<p>Since its beginnings with the industrial revolution, thermodynamics has
developed into a science that explains a wide array of natural and technical
phenomena. Thermodynamic laws govern a host of processes: heat to work
conversion in heat engines, and the inverse, i.e., the work to heat conversion
in freezers, refrigerators and air conditioning systems; mixing and separation;
transport through membranes (osmosis); chemical reactions and combustion,
and so on. All of these will be discussed in this text.
</p>
<p>In short, a good understanding of thermodynamics is indispensable in a
wide range of fields, in particular mechanical and chemical engineering, chem-
istry, physics, and life sciences.
</p>
<p>1.2 Mechanical and Thermodynamical Forces
</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion describe how a system reacts to an applied force:
it moves. For instance, a weight on a coiled-up thread can be used to bring
a shaft to rotation. When the shaft is connected to a generator, electricity
is produced: the potential energy of the weight is transformed into electrical
work. We see that a force, here gravity acting on the weight, can be used to
generate mechanical work, here the rotation of the shaft, which then can be
transformed again, here into electrical work. As long as the mechanical and
electrical systems used are frictionless and resistance free, there is no loss,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Mechanical and Thermodynamical Forces 3
</p>
<p>that is the electrical work produced is equal to the mechanical work done by
the weight.
</p>
<p>But, of course, there is friction and ohmic resistance, and some of the in-
put work is required to overcome these. Hence, in a system with friction, the
amount of electrical work provided is less than the work done by the weight.
So where has that work gone? Thermodynamics gives the answer: due to
friction and resistance, the system becomes warmer than its environment,
and then heat flows into the environment: some of the work is converted to
heat. While mechanics can describe friction losses, and electrodynamics can
describe ohmic resistance, a full account of the system requires a thermody-
namic description, entailing quantities like temperature and heat, which do
not appear in mechanics and electrodynamics.
</p>
<p>We all have some idea of what temperature is, since we have a sense for
hot and cold. Also, we have the experience that when we put a cold and a hot
body in contact, the cold body will become warmer and the warm body will
become colder, until they have the same temperature. Just think of a soft
drink originally at room temperature and ice: the ice will warm and melt,
and the drink will become cooler . . . and a bit watery. Or think of a hot cup
of coffee left on a table: After sufficiently long time the coffee assumes the
temperature of the room around&mdash;it has cooled down&mdash;while the air in the
room has become just a tiny bit warmer. Our iced soft drink, when forgotten
on the table, will eventually warm up to the room temperature. In both cases,
thermal energy is redistributed between the subsystems we looked at&mdash;soft
drink, ice, coffee, air in the room. The associated temperature change is also
linked to the size of the system: soft drink and ice both experience sensible
changes in temperature and state; also the coffee&rsquo;s temperature changes no-
ticeably, while it would require a rather sensitive thermometer to measure
the temperature change of the air in the room.
</p>
<p>Hot and cold drinks are just an example for a fundamental observation:
heat goes from hot to cold in the desire to equilibrate temperature. In analogy
to mechanics, where a force causes movement of its point of application, we
can say that the temperature difference is a thermodynamic force that causes
heat to flow. And just as a mechanical force can drive a generator to produce
electricity, the thermodynamic force can be used to generate mechanical work,
and electricity. This, in fact, is what a heat engine does.
</p>
<p>The tendency to equilibrate into a homogeneous state is not observed
only for temperature but also for other quantities. For instance, a droplet of
ink added to a glass of water will distribute until, after some time, the ink
concentration is homogeneous. This desire to mix evenly is driven by another
thermodynamic force, which is related to the difference in concentration.
Careful analysis will show that the driving force is the difference in a quantity
known as the chemical potential. Also this force can be harvested for work,
e.g. using osmosis, where freshwater is drawn into saltwater through semi-
permeable membranes that allow only water, but not salt, to pass.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4 1 Introduction: Why Thermodynamics?
</p>
<p>There are other examples for nature&rsquo;s desire to equilibrate, for instance
in chemical reactions. The amounts of reactants and reaction products will
assume an equilibrium state that depends on the actual conditions in the
reactor, such as pressure and temperature. Any equilibration process can be
described by a thermodynamic force, and can be used&mdash;at least in principle&mdash;
to provide work.
</p>
<p>Processes opposite to equilibration move against the thermodynamic forces,
and hence work must be provided to force these processes to happen. A re-
frigerator cools only a small part of the kitchen, by forcing heat from the
inside to the outside: (electrical) work is required to drive the compressor in
the refrigerator. Separation processes require work, or other forms of energy,
as well. Using the same semi-permeable membrane as above, one can produce
freshwater from saltwater by pressing the latter against the membrane. This
requires high pressures, and consumes work.
</p>
<p>Chemically fabricated materials are everywhere in our lives from clothing&mdash;
fleece has replaced wool&mdash;to medication. About one percent of the world&rsquo;s
energy consumption is used to produce ammonia (NH3) which is the base
product for nitrogen fertilizers and explosives. Widespread availability of
fertilizer, together with modern machines&mdash;driven by heat engines&mdash;for the
year-round farm work have increased yield from fields largely, while at the
same time the relative number of people working in farming has&mdash;in the first
world&mdash;declined dramatically. For all chemical processes the goal is to run the
reactors such that the yield is high. This requires perfect understanding of
the thermodynamic forces and equilibria, so that one can set the conditions,
e.g., pressure and temperature, accordingly.
</p>
<p>1.3 Systems, Balance Laws, Property Relations
</p>
<p>In order to describe thermal processes accurately, we require a number of
equations and relations to describe the behavior of the thermal system under
consideration, and the details of the materials contained in the system.
</p>
<p>The previous paragraph in fact points to the first requirement of any ther-
modynamic analysis, which is to chose a well defined system to be described,
e.g., the system could be an entire power plant, or just the steam turbine
within. In any case, the system boundary must be well defined so that all
transport of material, energy etc. across the system boundary is well under-
stood.
</p>
<p>The processes within a system are described by balance laws, equations
that account for all changes within the system as well as the transport across
the system boundary. Balance laws are often written as rate equations, where
the change of the amount of the balanced quantity over time is equated to
causes for change, such as flow over the boundary, or creation/destruction
inside the system.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.3 Systems, Balance Laws, Property Relations 5
</p>
<p>The simplest balance law is the conservation law for mass, which states
that mass cannot be created or destroyed. Hence, the mass inside the sys-
tem boundaries can change only due to transfer of mass in or out over the
boundaries. A closed system is defined as having no mass transfer over the
boundaries, accordingly the mass in a closed system is constant. In an open
system mass can enter or leave; this can lead to changing amount of mass
within the system, for instance when a container is filled, or, when the inflow
is balanced by the outflow, to an exchange of the material in the system,
while the mass in the system is constant.
</p>
<p>The conservation laws for energy states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed. To emphasize its central importance, it is known as the First Law
of Thermodynamics. Energy exists in different forms; familiar from mechanics
are kinetic and potential energy, and thermodynamics adds internal (also
called thermal) energy. The first law describes the conversion between the
different forms of energy, and the transport of energy in form of heat and
work. While the first law describes conversion from work to heat and vice
versa, it cannot distinguish between possible and impossible processes.
</p>
<p>Indeed, thermodynamic processes are restricted in many ways, e.g., heat
will by itself go from hot to cold and not vice versa, or a mixture will not
spontaneously separate. These restrictions are formulated in the Second Law
of Thermodynamics. The second law introduces a new quantity, the entropy,
which can only be created, but not destroyed. Accordingly, the second law is a
balance law for entropy that describes the change of entropy in the system due
to transport across the boundary, and creation inside the system. Since we
have no sense for entropy, this quantity is somewhat non-intuitive, however,
the second law is seen at work quite easily, for instance in all equilibration
processes such as those discussed above. Processes in which entropy is created
are called irreversible, and any creation of entropy can be related to a loss in
work. The second law has far ranging consequences, including the restriction
of the efficiency of heat engines to values below unity, that is, heat cannot be
fully converted into work.
</p>
<p>As just stated, we have no sense for entropy. But then, we have no sense
for energy as well, and our sense for temperature is rather inexact. To fill
the thermodynamic laws with life, the quantities appearing in them, most
importantly energy and entropy, must be related to measurable quantities.
</p>
<p>With temperature playing a prominent role in thermodynamics, temper-
ature and its measurement must be clearly defined, which is done by means
of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics, which states that two bodies in equi-
librium have the same temperature. The assigned number (zero) indicates
that this law now is introduced before the first and second laws, but histori-
cally its importance for a sound development of thermodynamic theory was
recognized only after these were named.
</p>
<p>Measurable quantities are length (and thus area and volume), time (and
thus velocity and acceleration), mass, pressure (or force), temperature, and
concentration. For specific systems the thermodynamic lawsmust be furnished</p>

<p>6 1 Introduction: Why Thermodynamics?
</p>
<p>with property relations that describe the physical behavior of the materials
contained in the system, by relating measurable quantities to each other as
well as to those that cannot be measured directly (energy, entropy . . . ). Prop-
erty relations are laid down in equations or in tables, they result from careful
measurements and evaluation of these by means of the thermodynamic laws.
</p>
<p>1.4 Thermodynamics as Engineering Science
</p>
<p>Typically, scientists and engineers ask different questions. With some sim-
plification, one might say that a scientist asks Why does this happen?, while
an engineer asks How can I use it? But then, the boundaries between sci-
ence and engineering are rather fluent, and there is significant overlap. For
instance, both disciplines will be interested in the basic laws&mdash;in form of
equations&mdash;that describe the observed phenomena. For the scientist this is
part of understanding and describing nature, while for the engineer the basic
laws are tools to model and improve engineering devices. It is probably fair
to say that the deeper an engineer understands the laws of nature, the more
use she/he can make of them. Deeper understanding will lead to new ideas
that might not be obvious at the first look.
</p>
<p>As stated earlier, thermodynamics was developed out of an engineering
desire, namely to improve the efficiencies of heat engines. This need resulted
in the thermodynamic laws, which were found on purely phenomenological
grounds, that is by observation and conclusion. As will be seen, thermal
energy and entropy arise as necessary, and rather helpful, quantities, which
appear in their respective laws (1st and 2nd). The laws describe work and heat
exchange, and the trend to equilibrium, but they do not answer the questions
What is energy? What is entropy? Indeed, for engineering applications the
answer to these questions is not relevant, as long as property relations for
energy and entropy can be found from measurements, as is the case.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of these quantities can be obtained
by looking at the microscopic description of matter, that is on the atomic
or molecular level. Thermal energy can be related to microscopic kinetic and
potential energies, so that concepts from mechanics can be transferred to
some degree.
</p>
<p>Entropy can be related to the number of microscopic realizations of the
same macroscopic state, as will be discussed for rather simple model exam-
ples. The trend to equilibrium as expressed in the second law is then simply a
motion of the system towards macroscopic states that have a larger number of
microscopic realizations. The final equilibrium state has the largest number
of realizations, and thus is&mdash;by far&mdash;most likely. Often one finds explanations
of entropy as a measure for &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;, but this might be misleading wording,
unless a careful definition of &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; is provided.
</p>
<p>Even somewhat superficial arguments on microscopic behavior can yield
deeper insight into entropy, and thermodynamic processes. Hence, the</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.5 Thermodynamic Analysis 7
</p>
<p>introductory chapter on entropy and the chapters on reacting and non-reacting
mixtures contain some descriptions on the microscopic level. Naturally, we
can just scratch the surface. The reader might study these sections for some
insight&mdash;for deeper understanding, we must refer to the relevant scientific
literature.
</p>
<p>As might become clear from the above, the microscopic description of
entropy relies on ideas of statistics. The proper understanding of matter on
the microscopic level is subject of Statistical Mechanics, a branch of physics
which for instance can be used to find property relations.
</p>
<p>1.5 Thermodynamic Analysis
</p>
<p>After the introduction and general discussion of the basic laws of thermody-
namics and the property relations, the study of thermodynamics turns to the
thermodynamic analysis of a wide variety of systems.
</p>
<p>The system considered, and the goal of the analysis, depends on the field
of study. This text focuses on engineering applications of thermodynamics,
where the aim is to understand the working principles, and to evaluate the
performance of thermodynamic systems such as power plants, refrigerators,
chemical reactors and so on. Deep understanding of system behavior from
thermodynamic analysis will lead to performance enhancement by proper
setting of available parameters, redesign for improved efficiency, replacement
by more efficient alternatives, and, possibly, to development of completely
new system configurations.

<p>Systems, States, and Processes
</p>
<p>2.1 The Closed System
</p>
<p>The first step in any thermodynamic consideration is to identify the system
that one wishes to describe. Any complex system, e.g., a power plant, can be
seen as a compound of some&mdash;or many&mdash;smaller and simpler systems that
interact with each other. For the basic understanding of the thermodynamic
laws it is best to begin with the simplest system, and study more complex
systems later as assemblies of these simple systems.
</p>
<p>The simplest system of interest is the closed system where a substance
is enclosed by walls, and no mass flows over the system boundaries. The
prototype of the closed system is a piston-cylinder device, as depicted in
Fig. 2.1. We shall assume that the device contains a fixed amount of a simple
substance, that is a substance that does not undergo chemical changes.
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.1 The piston-cylinder device with heat and work exchange is the standard
example for closed systems
</p>
<p>There is only a small number of manipulations possible to change the
state of a closed system, which are indicated in the figure: the volume of

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 2 Systems, States, and Processes
</p>
<p>the system can be changed by moving the piston, the system can be stirred
with a propeller, and the system can be heated or cooled by changing the
temperature of the system boundary, as indicated by the heating coil.1 These
actions lead to exchange of energy between the system and its surroundings,
either by work in case of piston movement and stirring, or by the exchange
of heat. The transfer of energy by work and heat will be formulated in the
First Law of Thermodynamics.
</p>
<p>The change of energy and volume of the system will lead to changes in
other properties of the enclosed substance, in particular pressure and tem-
perature. Thermodynamic laws and property relations are required to predict
the changes of the different properties, and the exchange of heat and work.
</p>
<p>Most processes have a direction in time. For instance, we can do work to
move the propeller and stir a liquid, which increases the liquid temperature
due to friction, but we will never observe that a liquid at rest suddenly begins
to move a propeller and does work (e.g. the lifting of a weight), see Fig. 2.2.
The direction of processes is formulated in the Second Law of Thermody-
namics, which has, as will be seen, far ranging consequences for technical
applications.
</p>
<p>possible impossible
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.2 A possible and an impossible process
</p>
<p>We shall first consider the complete set of thermodynamic equations for
closed systems. In open systems mass crosses the system boundaries, and this
leads to additional terms in the thermodynamic laws. These will be discussed
in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>2.2 Micro and Macro
</p>
<p>A macroscopic amount of matter filling the volume V , say a steel rod or a
gas in a box, consists of an extremely large number&mdash;to the order of 1023&mdash;
of atoms or molecules. These are in constant interaction which each other

<p>1 Another possibility to heat or cool the system is through absorption and emission
of radiation, and transfer of radiation across the system boundary.</p>

<p>2.3 Mechanical State Properties 13
</p>
<p>and exchange energy and momentum, e.g., a gas particle in air at standard
conditions undergoes about 109 collisions per second.
</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of mechanics, one would have to describe each particle
by its own (quantummechanical) equation of motion, in which the interactions
with all other particles would have to be taken into account. Obviously, due to
the huge number of particles, this is not feasible. Fortunately, the constant in-
teraction between particles leads to a collective behavior of the matter already
in very small volume elements dV , in which the state of the matter can be de-
scribed by fewmacroscopic properties like pressure, mass density, temperature
and others. This allows us to describe the matter not as an assembly of atoms,
but as a continuum where the state in each volume element dV is described by
these few macroscopic properties.
</p>
<p>Note that the underlying assumption is that the volume element contains
a sufficiently large number of particles. Indeed, the continuum hypothesis
breaks down under certain circumstances, in particular for highly rarefied
gases. In all what follows, however, we shall only consider systems in which
the assumption is well justified.
</p>
<p>2.3 Mechanical State Properties
</p>
<p>Of the many state properties that we shall meet, we first introduce those
properties that can be easily measured, and are familiar from mechanics.
</p>
<p>We consider a system of volume V which is filled by a massm of substance.
To describe variation of properties in space, it is useful to divide the system
into infinitesimal elements of size dV and mass dm, as sketched in Fig. 2.3.
</p>
<p>V =

</p>
<p>Fig. 2.3 A system of volume V and mass m is divided into infinitesimal elements
of size dV and mass dm
</p>
<p>The volume V =
&int;
</p>
<p>dV filled by the substance can, in principle, be mea-
sured by means of a ruler. The SI unit for volume is the cubic meter [m3],</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14 2 Systems, States, and Processes
</p>
<p>for smaller volumes one might use the litre, 1 litre = 10&minus;3m3, or the cubic
centimetre, 1 cm3 = 10&minus;3 litre = 10&minus;6m3.
</p>
<p>The mass m =
&int;
</p>
<p>dm of the substance can be measured using a scale. The
SI unit of mass is kilogram [ kg]. For small masses it is convenient to use the
gram, 1 g = 10&minus;3 kg, and for large masses it is convenient to use the metric
ton, 1 t = 1000 kg.
</p>
<p>The pressure p of the substance can be measured as the force required to
keep a piston in place, divided by the surface area of the piston. The SI unit
for pressure is the Pascal: 1 Pa = 1 Nm2 = 1
</p>
<p>kg
m s2 ; one often uses the kilo-Pascal,
</p>
<p>1 kPa = 1000Pa, or the mega-Pascal, 1MPa = 106Pa. Two common non-SI
units for pressure are the bar, 1 bar = 105Pa = 0.1MPa, and the atmosphere
(the standard air pressure at sea level), 1 atm = 1.01325 bar.
</p>
<p>Many pressure measuring devices (manometers) do not measure absolute
pressure, but the difference to the local atmospheric pressure patm (which
is normally not 1 atm!), the so-called gauge pressure pgauge = p &minus; patm. For
pressures below the local atmospheric pressure the gauge pressure would be
negative, and it is common to use the vacuum pressure pvac = patm &minus; p.
</p>
<p>The velocity vector of a mass element is defined as its directed displacement
per unit time. Mostly we shall be interested only in the absolute velocity V ,
the SI unit is meters per second

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>2.4 Extensive and Intensive Properties
</p>
<p>It is useful to distinguish between extensive properties, which are related to
the size of the system, and intensive properties, which are independent of
the size of the system. Mass m and volume V are extensive quantities, e.g.,
they double when the system is doubled; pressure p and temperature T are
intensive properties, they remain unchanged when the system is doubled.
As an example Fig. 2.4 shows the combination (or splitting) of a system at
pressure p and temperature T , with total mass m1+m2 and volume V1+V2.
</p>
<p>2.5 Specific Properties
</p>
<p>A particular class of intensive properties are the specific properties, which
are defined as the ratio between an extensive property and the correspond-
ing mass. In general notation, the specific property φ corresponding to the
extensive property Φ is defined as
</p>
<p>φ =
Φ
</p>
<p>m
. (2.1)
</p>
<p>For instance, the specific volume is
</p>
<p>v =

</p>

</p>
<p>2.6 Molar Properties
</p>
<p>For the thermodynamic discussion of mixtures, reacting or not, it is advan-
tageous to consider the number of particles involved rather than mass. The
number of atoms or molecules is rather large and thus it is customary to
count the number of particles in moles, with the unit [mol] or [ kmol]. One
mole is the number of atoms in 12 g of the carbon isotope 12C, which is given
by the Avogadro constant (Amedeo Avogadro, 1776-1856)
</p>
<p>NA = 6.022&times; 1023
1
</p>
<p>mol
. (2.3)
</p>
<p>The mass of one mole of particles is the molar mass M with the unit 1 gmol =
</p>
<p>1 kgkmol . By definition, the molar mass of
12C is MC = 12
</p>
<p>kg
kmol , the molar mass
</p>
<p>for other substances can be found in tables.
The number of moles of substance is related to mass by

</p>

.
</p>
<p>Mole specific properties will be labeled with an overbar, they are related to
extensive and mass specific properties as, e.g.,

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16 2 Systems, States, and Processes
</p>
<p>2.7 Inhomogeneous States
</p>
<p>In inhomogeneous states intensive and specific properties vary locally, that
is they have different values in different volume elements dV . In this case,
the local specific properties are defined through the values of the extensive
property dΦ and the mass dm in the volume element,
</p>
<p>φ =
dΦ
</p>
<p>dm
. (2.5)
</p>
<p>For example, the local specific volume v and the local mass density ρ are
defined as
</p>
<p>v =
1
</p>
<p>ρ
=
</p>
<p>dV
</p>
<p>dm
. (2.6)
</p>
<p>The values of the extensive properties for the full system are determined
by integration of the specific properties over the mass elements,
</p>
<p>Φ =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>φdm , (2.7)
</p>
<p>or, by means of the relation dm = ρdV , by integration over the volume
elements,
</p>
<p>Φ =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>ρφdV . (2.8)
</p>
<p>As an example, Fig. 2.5 shows the inhomogeneous distribution of mass density
ρ in a system. Note that due to inhomogeneity, the density is a function of
location &minus;&rarr;r = {x, y, z} of the element dV , hence ρ = ρ (&minus;&rarr;r ).

<p>2.9 Quasi-static and Fast Processes 17
</p>
<p>2.8 Processes and Equilibrium States
</p>
<p>A process is any change in one or more properties occurring within a system.
The system depicted in Fig. 2.1 can be manipulated by moving the piston
or propeller, and by exchanging heat. Any manipulation changes the state of
the system locally and globally: a process occurs.
</p>
<p>After all manipulation stops, the states in the volume elements will keep
changing for a while&mdash;that is the process continues&mdash;until a stable final state
is assumed. This stable final state is called the equilibrium state. The system
will remain in the equilibrium state until a new manipulation commences.
</p>
<p>Simple examples from daily life are: (a) A cup of coffee is stirred with a
spoon. After the spoon is removed, the coffee will keep moving for a while
until it comes to rest. It will stay at rest indefinitely, unless stirring is recom-
menced or the cup is moved. (b) Milk is poured into coffee. Initially, there
are light-brown regions of large milk content and dark-brown regions of low
milk content. After a while, however, coffee and milk are well-mixed, at mid-
brown color, and remain in that state. Stirring speeds the process up, but
the mixing occurs also when no stirring takes place. (c) A spoon used to
stir hot coffee becomes hot at the end immersed in the coffee. A while after
it is removed from the cup, it will have assumed a homogeneous tempera-
ture. (d) Oil mixed with vinegar by stirring will separate after a while, with
oil on top of the vinegar. The last example shows that not all equilibrium
states are homogeneous; however, temperature will always be homogeneous
in equilibrium.
</p>
<p>In short, observation of daily processes, and experiments in the laboratory,
show that a system that is left to itself for a sufficiently long time will ap-
proach a stable equilibrium state, and will remain in this state as long as the
system is not subjected to further action.
</p>
<p>The details of the equilibrium state depend on the constraints on the sys-
tem, in particular material, size and energy. The time required for reaching
the equilibrium state depends on the initial deviation from the equilibrium
state, the material, and the geometry.2 A change of pressure at the system
boundary propagates with the speed of sound (sound is a pressure wave) into
the system, which will reach a new equilibrium pressure relatively fast. On
the other hand, a change of temperature at the system boundary diffuses
relatively slowly into the system: the spoon that is used to stir hot coffee
needs quite a while to feel hot at the side that is not immersed in the cup.
</p>
<p>2.9 Quasi-static and Fast Processes
</p>
<p>Whenone starts tomanipulate a system that is initially in equilibrium, the equi-
librium state is disturbed, and a new process occurs. When the manipulation
</p>
<p>2 Some systems remain in metastable states for very long time, until a bigger
disturbance causes them to go into their stable equilibrium state.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18 2 Systems, States, and Processes
</p>
<p>happens sufficiently slow, the system can adapt so that it is in an equilibrium
state at any time. Slow processes that lead the system through a series of equi-
librium states are called quasi-static, or quasi-equilibrium, processes.
</p>
<p>If the manipulation that causes a quasi-static process stops, the system is
already in an equilibrium state, and no further change will be observed.
</p>
<p>Equilibrium states are simple, quite often they are homogenous states, or
can be approximated as homogeneous states. The state of the system is fully
described by few extensive properties, such as mass, volume, energy, and the
corresponding pressure and temperature.
</p>
<p>When the manipulation is fast, so that the system has no time to reach a
new equilibrium state, it will be in non-equilibrium states. If the manipulation
that causes a non-equilibrium process stops, the system will undergo changes
until it has reached its equilibrium state. The equilibration process takes
place while no manipulation occurs, i.e., the system is left to itself. Thus, the
equilibration is an uncontrolled process.
</p>
<p>Non-equilibrium processes typically are inhomogeneous. Their proper de-
scription requires values of the properties at all locations&minus;&rarr;r (i.e., in all volume
elements dV ) of the system. The detailed description of non-equilibrium pro-
cesses is more complex than the description of quasi-static processes.
</p>
<p>All real-life applications of thermodynamics involve some degree of non-
equilibrium. Quasi-static processes are an idealization that serves to approx-
imate real-life&mdash;i.e., non-equilibrium&mdash;processes.
</p>
<p>2.10 Reversible and Irreversible Processes
</p>
<p>The approach to equilibrium introduces a timeline for processes: As time
progresses, an isolated system will always go towards its unique equilibrium
state. The opposite will not be observed, that is a system will never be seen
spontaneously leaving its equilibrium state when no manipulation occurs.
</p>
<p>Indeed, we immediately detect whether a movie of a non-equilibrium pro-
cess is played forward or backwards: well mixed milk coffee will not separate
suddenly into milk and coffee; a spoon of constant temperature will not sud-
denly become hot at one end, and cold at the other; a propeller immersed in
a fluid at rest will not suddenly start to move and lift a weight (Fig. 2.2);
oil on top of water will not suddenly mix with the water; etc. We shall call
processes with a time-line irreversible.
</p>
<p>Only for quasi-static processes, where the system is always in equilibrium
states, we cannot distinguish whether a movie is played forwards or back-
wards. We shall call these processes reversible. Since equilibration requires
time, quasi-static, or reversible, processes typically are slow processes, so
that the system always has sufficient time to adapt to an imposed change.
</p>
<p>Equilibration processes can have quite different time scales. For instance,
pressure changes are transported with the speed of sound (&sim; 350 ms ), and
piston cylinder systems can be approximated as quasi-static if the piston</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.11 Temperature and the Zeroth Law 19
</p>
<p>velocity is significantly below the speed of sound. The mean piston speed in
a car engine, which depends on stroke and speed, is typically below 20 ms ,
hence compression and expansion processes in a car engine can be considered
as quasi-static. Heat transfer, on the other hand, is a very slow process, with
a time scale determined by the heat conductivity. Accordingly, quasi-static
processes involving heating must be rather slow. For fast processes such as
the compression and expansion process in a car engine, there is no time at
all for significant heat transfer between the cylinder walls and the gas, and
the process can be approximated as quasi-static processes with no heating.
</p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics will be introduced as formalization of
the observation that an isolated system is moving towards a unique equi-
librium state, and will allow for a more formal definition of reversible and
irreversible processes.
</p>
<p>2.11 Temperature and the Zeroth Law
</p>
<p>So far we have discussed only properties known from mechanics, namely mass
m, volume V , pressure p, and velocity V . Temperature, as a measure of how
hot or cold a body is, is the first thermodynamic quantity that we introduce.
</p>
<p>Indeed, through touching objects we can distinguish between hot and cold.
However, our sense for temperature is relatively inexact, just feel the metal
and the wood of your chair, which have the same temperature, but feel differ-
ent. Objective measurement of temperature requires (a) a proper definition,
and (b) a proper device for measurement&mdash;a thermometer.
</p>
<p>Observation of nature and of processes towards equilibrium have estab-
lished the following definition of temperature:
</p>
<p>Two bodies in thermal equilibrium have the same temperature.
</p>
<p>This statement is so important that it is known as the Zeroth Law of
Thermodynamics. As example, consider two bodies, e.g., a cup of hot coffee
and a spoon, or two stones, at different temperatures T̄A &gt; T̄B which are
brought into thermal contact, see Fig. 2.6 for a schematic representation.
An equilibration process occurs, and after a while the system comprised of
the two bodies reaches its equilibrium state, with a common temperature T .
While we shall need the first law&mdash;the conservation of energy&mdash;to compute
its actual value, we know from experience that the final temperature will lie
between the initial temperatures, T̄A &gt; T &gt; T̄B.
</p>
<p>The zeroth law as stated above implies that if body A is in thermal equi-
librium with bodies B and C, than also bodies B and C will be in equilibrium.
All three will have the same temperature.
</p>
<p>Thus, to measure the temperature of a body, all we have to do is to bring
a calibrated thermometer into contact with the body and wait until the equi-
librium state of the system (body and thermometer) is reached. When the
size of the thermometer is small compared to the size of the body, the final</p>

<p>Fig. 2.6 Two bodies of different temperatures T̄A, T̄B assume a common temper-
ature T a while after they are brought into thermal contact
</p>
<p>temperature of body and thermometer will be almost equal to the initial
temperature of the body, see Sec. 3.12.
</p>
<p>2.12 Thermometers and Temperature Scale
</p>
<p>So what is a thermometer? Thermometers rely on the change of physical
properties with temperature. The volume of most liquids grows with temper-
ature, the volume change is employed in mercury or alcohol thermometers:
liquid thermometers rely on the measurement of length. Resistance ther-
mometers rely on the change of ohmic resistance of electric conductors with
temperature. Thermocouples use thermoelectric effects&mdash;voltage caused by
temperature difference&mdash;to measure temperatures.
</p>
<p>Thermometers must be carefully calibrated, so that different thermome-
ters, and different types of thermometers, will agree in their measurements.
The calibration requires reference points that can be reproduced accurately,
and a proper definition of the scale between the reference points.
</p>
<p>The temperature scale used in daily life is the Celsius scale which measures
temperature in degrees Celsius [ ◦C]. The Celsius scale was originally defined
based on the boiling and freezing points of water at p = 1 atm to define the
temperatures of 100 ◦C and 0 ◦C. The Fahrenheit scale, which is employed in
the USA, assigns these points the temperatures 212 ◦F and 32 ◦F. National
and international bureaus of standards now use a larger number of well-
defined fix points for the calibration of thermometers.
</p>
<p>Just having reference points is not enough, theremust be a well-defined scale
for the temperatures between the reference points. As an example we consider
two liquid thermometers filled with different liquids A and B, which are build
such that their liquid columns have the same heights for the reference points
at 0 ◦C and 100 ◦C, see Fig. 2.7. However, the change of volume with temper-
ature might follow different non-linear functions V (T ) for the two liquids, so
that both thermometers show different heights for temperatures between the
reference points, as example the figure shows different readings for 50 ◦C.</p>

</p>
<p>2.13 Gas Temperature Scale
</p>
<p>To define a proper temperature scale between the reference points, one has to
agree on a particular reference substance, and define the scale for that sub-
stance. Thermometers involving other substances, or other physical effects,
can then be calibrated based on the reference.
</p>
<p>The reference substance used is the ideal gas. Any gas at sufficiently low
pressures and large enough temperatures (see Sec. 6.10), behaves as an ideal
gas. From experiments one observes that for an ideal gas confined to a fixed
volume the pressure increases with temperature. The temperature scale is
defined such that the relation between pressure and temperature is linear,
that is
</p>
<p>T ( ◦C) = a+ bp (2.9)
</p>
<p>where the two constants a and b can be found from two well-defined reference
points. With this, temperature is determined through measurement of pres-
sure, see Fig. 2.8. For the Celsius scale one finds a = &minus;273.15 ◦C independent
of the ideal gas used. The constant b depends on the volume, mass and type
of the gas in the thermometer.
</p>
<p>By shifting the temperature scale by a, one can define an alternative scale,
the ideal gas temperature scale, as
</p>
<p>T (K) = bp . (2.10)
</p>
<p>The ideal gas scale has the unit Kelvin [K, not ◦ K] and is related to the
Celsius scale as
</p>
<p>T (K) = T ( ◦C)
K
◦C
</p>
<p>+ 273.15K . (2.11)</p>

<p>V = const
T , p
</p>
<p>T = a + bp
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.8 In a gas thermometer, temperature T is determined through measurement
of pressure p
</p>
<p>For engineering problems one often uses T ( K) = T ( ◦C) K◦C + 273K, that is
one ignores the difference of 0.15K to the exact value. Temperature differ-
ences have the same numerical value for both scales, ∆T (K) = ∆T ( ◦C) K◦C .
</p>
<p>Since pressure cannot be negative, the ideal gas temperature cannot as-
sume negative values, T ( K) &ge; 0. The ideal gas temperature scale fulfills all
requirements on the thermodynamic temperature scale that will follow from
the second law, and it coincides with the thermodynamic Kelvin scale. Much
later, in Sec. 23.6, we will learn about the 3rd law of thermodynamics which,
simply put, states that absolute zero &equiv; 0K cannot be reached.
</p>
<p>Some care must be taken in notation. For convenience temperatures are
quite often given on the Celsius scale, but many thermodynamic equations
require the thermodynamic temperature in Kelvin. Most often the same sym-
bol, T , is used for temperatures on either scale, one has to be careful to not
get confused.
</p>
<p>2.14 Thermal Equation of State
</p>
<p>Careful measurements on simple substances show that specific volume v (or
density ρ = 1/v), pressure p and temperature T cannot be controlled inde-
pendently. Indeed, they are linked through a relation of the form p = p (v, T ),
or p = p (ρ, T ), known as the thermal equation of state. For most substances,
this relation cannot be easily expressed as an actual equation, but is laid
down in property tables, see Chapter 6.
</p>
<p>The thermal equation of state relates measurable properties. It suffices to
know the values of two properties to determine the values of others. This will
still be the case when we add energy and entropy to the list of thermodynamic
properties, which can be determined through measurement of any two of the
measurable properties, i.e., (p, T ) or (v, T ) or (p, v).
</p>
<p>For inhomogeneous states, where the properties are space dependent, we
assume the validity of the thermal equation of state in the local volume</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.15 Ideal Gas Law 23
</p>
<p>element dV . This assumption reflects our understanding that the atoms and
molecules of the considered substance are interacting frequently, and thus
behave collectively, see Sec. 2.2.
</p>
<p>To summarize: The complete knowledge of the macroscopic state of a sys-
tem requires the values of two intensive properties in each location (i.e., in
each infinitesimal volume element), and the local velocity. The state of a sys-
tem in equilibrium, where properties are homogeneous, is described by just
two intensive properties (plus the size of the system, that is either total vol-
ume, or total mass). In comparison, the knowledge of the microscopic state
would require the knowledge of location and velocity of each particle.
</p>
<p>2.15 Ideal Gas Law
</p>
<p>The ideal gas is one of the simplest substances to study, since it has simple
property relations. Ideal gases are employed in many engineering applications.
Arguably, the most important ideal gas is air, which is the working substance
in a large number of systems, including internal combustion engines.
</p>
<p>Careful measurements have shown that for an ideal gas pressure p, total
volume V , thermodynamic temperature T , and mass m are related by an
explicit thermal equation of state, the ideal gas law
</p>
<p>pV = mRT . (2.12)
</p>
<p>Here, R is the gas constant that depends on the type of the gas. Alternative
forms of the equation result from introducing the specific volume v = V/m
or the mass density ρ = 1/v so that
</p>
<p>pv = RT , p = ρRT. (2.13)
</p>
<p>The ideal gas law is our first property relation. According to this equation,
the properties appearing in the equation cannot be changed independently:
the change of one property must necessarily lead to a change of at least
one other property. When the temperature is kept constant, an increase in
pressure leads to a reduction of volume; when pressure is kept constant, the
increase of temperature leads to increase of volume; when volume is kept
constant, reduction of temperature leads to lower pressure. Of course, there
can be processes where all three, pressure, volume, and temperature, change.
</p>
<p>The gas constant R has the unit
[
</p>
<p>kJ

</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>, where 1 kJ = 103Nm is the
</p>
<p>energy unit kilo-Joule. Further examination has shown that the gas constant
is related to the molar mass of the gas. One finds

<p>2.16 A Note on Problem Solving
</p>
<p>Before we start solving our first problems, it might be worthwhile to briefly
list good practices for problem solving. Typically, any engineering problem
should be tackled by the following steps:
</p>
<p>1. Understand the problem, i.e., read the question carefully. Nothing good
can come from a solution that is based on a misunderstanding.
</p>
<p>2. Make a sketch of the relevant system, and proper diagrams. A good sketch
can summarize a complicatedly worded problem in a far more accessible
form.

</p>
<p>3. Indicate all quantities that are known on the sketch, or in a list, so that
they are easy to find when needed. List all processes that occur in the
system
</p>
<p>4. List the quantities that need to be determined.
5. List the relevant thermodynamic equations for their determination.
6. Simplify the equations based on what is known about the processes in
</p>
<p>the system.
7. Solve the equations for the quantities of interest. Do not insert values
</p>
<p>for quantities before all manipulation of equations is complete; in other
words, solve symbolically, and insert values as late as possible. This sim-
plifies double checking of computations, and makes it far easier to correct
errors that occur due to mistyping of values or wrong unit conversions.
</p>
<p>8. Carefully consider and simplify all units. Before you have sufficient prac-
tice, never assume the outcome of a unit conversion, or the final unit for
a value in a computation. Wrong unit conversions are a rather frequent
source of major problems: always double-check. Note that each property
value must be accompanied by a unit, i.e., never just write a number but
[number value&times;unit].
</p>
<p>9. Add comments throughout your treatment of the problem, so that you
have text and equations/values on your answer. Written out sentences
make the solution accessible, and you can explain assumptions, simplifi-
cations etc. This makes it far easier to follow through the line of argument
for any reader&mdash;including yourself at a later point in time; just equations
make for an unreadable submission.
</p>
<p>10. Finally, use experience and common sense to scrutinize the final results.
Do they make sense, e.g., are the values for temperatures, pressures,
energies etc. realistic?
</p>
<p>We shall as much as possible adhere to these steps in the examples through-
out this book. However, due to space restrictions, we will, e.g., not always
have a sketch, and will skip over algebraic reformulations of equations. More-
over, explicit unit conversions will be shown only in few early examples. It is
strongly recommended that the reader goes through the examples carefully,
including making a sketch, and double checking of all calculations, including
the units.

<p>2.17 Example: Air in a Room
</p>
<p>A room of dimension 5m &times; 10m &times; 3m is filled with air at 20 ◦C, 1 atm.
Compute the mass of air in the room, the number of moles and the number
of particles. If the temperature in the room increases to 25 ◦C for the same
pressure, what amount of air has left through doors and windows?
</p>
<p>We use the ideal gas law (2.12) with the values V = 150m3, p =
101.325 kPa, T = 293K. Note that the ideal gas law requires the Kelvin
temperature! We find, with R = 0.287 kJkgK as the gas constant for air,</p>

<p>2.18 Example: Air in a Refrigerator
</p>
<p>A refrigerator of volume VR = 330 litre which maintains food at TR = 5
◦C
</p>
<p>is located in a kitchen at T0 = 22
◦C, p0 = 1.02 atm. When the refrigerator
</p>
<p>door is opened, warm air enters the cooling space, and when the door is closed
again, this warm air is cooled to TR. We ask for the amount of air inside, and
for the net force on the door after cooling is complete.
</p>
<p>To simplify the problem, we assume that the air in the refrigerator is
completely exchanged, so that in the moment of closing all air in the interior
is at T0, p0. Then, the mass in the interior is, with p0 = 103.35 kPa, VR =
0.33m3, T0 = 295K and R = 0.287

<p>As long as no air enters during the cooling process, the pressure in the

</p>
<p>= 0.961 atm = 97.4 kPa .
</p>
<p>When the door has an area of A = 0.6m2, the pressure difference between
inside and outside gives the net force
</p>
<p>F = A (p0 &minus; pR) = 3.57 kN .
</p>
<p>This force must be overcome to open the door. Note that the calculation
assumes perfect sealing, and complete replacement of the cold air with warm
air. Actual kitchen refrigerators have imperfect seals, so that some air creeps
through during cooling, hence the observed forces are weaker. Nevertheless,
in particular not too long after closing, one can observe this effect. Try your
refrigerator at home!</p>

</p>
<p>Pressure p is defined as the force (F ) exerted by a fluid per unit area (A),
p = F/A, in the limit of infinitesimal area. Pressure is isotropic, that is the
force on a surface is independent of the orientation of that surface.

<p>Fig. 2.9 A piston resting on a liquid
</p>
<p>A piston of mass m and cross section A rests on a liquid in a cylinder,
as depicted in Fig. 2.9; the atmospheric pressure is p0. We determine the
pressure p of the liquid at the piston.
</p>
<p>The piston is at rest, in mechanical equilibrium, which implies that all
forces Fi on the piston add up to zero,
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>Fi = 0. The acting forces are the
weight mg of the piston, where g = 9.81 ms2 is the gravitational acceleration,
and the pressure forces due to atmospheric and liquid pressure, p0A and pA,
respectively. With the proper signs for the forces we have
</p>
<p>mg + p0A&minus; pA = 0 =&rArr; p = p0 +
mg
</p>
<p>A
. (2.19)
</p>
<p>The system pressure, p, balances the external pressure, p0, and the weight of
the piston.
</p>
<p>Gravitation leads to variation of water pressure with depth, and of air
pressure with height. We compute both following Fig. 2.10. The water-air
interface is at the location z = 0 where the pressure is p0. The insert shows
a small layer of substance, air or water, of thickness dz and cross section A.
The mass of the layer, dm, follows from the mass density ρ and the layer
volume dV = Adz as dm = ρAdz.
</p>
<p>The forces acting on the layer are the contributions of the pressures below,
p (z)A, and above, p (z + dz)A, and the weight g dm = ρgAdz . We assume
the fluid (air or water) is at rest, so that the forces balance,
</p>
<p>p (z + dz)A+ ρgAdz &minus; p (z)A = 0 . (2.20)
</p>
<p>For infinitesimal dz we can use Taylor&rsquo;s formula p (z + dz) = p (z) + dp(z)dz dz
and find a differential equation for pressure,

<p>Fig. 2.10 On the computation of pressure variation in the gravitational field
</p>
<p>To proceed, we have to differentiate between water and air. First we con-
sider water: Water can be assumed in good approximation to be an incom-
pressible substance, that is the water density is constant, with the well-known
value of ρH2O ≃ 1000
</p>
<p>kg
m3 . Integration of (2.21) is straightforward, and gives,
</p>
<p>together with the condition p (z = 0) = p0,
</p>
<p>p (z) = p0 &minus; ρgz . (2.22)
</p>
<p>This is the hydrostatic pressure law, which is often written in terms of depth
h = &minus;z as
</p>
<p>p (h) = p0 + ρgh . (2.23)
</p>
<p>This relation is valid for all incompressible liquids, where the appropriate
mass density ρ must be used. For water, depth increase by ∆h = 10.33m
increases the pressure by about 1 atm. Hydrostatic pressure depends only on
depth, not on the actual weight of liquid above. This implies that hydrostatic
pressure is independent of the geometry of the container, see Fig. 2.11 for an
illustration.
</p>
<p>Air, on the other hand, is compressible, it obeys the ideal gas law p = ρRT .
Using this to eliminate density from the differential equation for pressure
(2.21), we find
</p>
<p>dp (z)
</p>
<p>p
= &minus; g
</p>
<p>RT (z)
dz . (2.24)
</p>
<p>Integration is only possible when we have additional information on the tem-
perature T (z) as a function of height z.</p>

<p>When the atmospheric temperature is constant, T (z) = T0, integration

barometric formula
</p>
<p>p = p0e

</p>
<p>RT0 . (2.25)
</p>
<p>This formula describes the exponential decrease of pressure with height in an
isothermal atmosphere.
</p>
<p>In the actual atmosphere, however, the temperature is not constant, but
decreases with height approximately as T (z) = T0 &minus; αz with α = 10 Kkm .

<p>Figure 2.12 compares both pressure functions for air and T0 = 293K. For
the non-isothermal atmosphere the pressure decreases slightly faster, but at
moderate heights the difference is almost not noticeable. The Canadian town
of Banff is located at an altitude of 1463m above sea level. When the sea level
pressure is p0 = 1 atm we compute from (2.25) and (2.26) local pressures of
0.843 atm and 0.839 atm, respectively. Note that most weather forecasts do
not present the actual local pressure p, but the normalized pressure, that is
the corresponding sea level pressure p0. For instance, when the forecast gives
the pressure for Banff as 990 kPa, based on (2.26) the actual pressure in town
will be 831 kPa.
</p>
<p>The example shows a marked influence of gravitation on pressure for
heights on the kilometer scale. Most engineering devices are relatively small,
at most on the scale of several meters, and the variation of gas pressure can
be safely ignored. Therefore it is sufficient to assign just one value of pressure
to a gaseous system in equilibrium.
</p>
<p>Gas pressure results from the momentum change of those gas particles
that hit the wall and bounce back, and thus exert a force. When a gas filled
container is put on a scale, the scale will show the total weight of container and
gas, although most of the gas particles are not in contact with the container</p>

<p>The First Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>3.1 Conservation of Energy
</p>
<p>It is our daily experience that heat can be converted to work, and that work
can be converted to heat. A propeller mounted over a burning candle will spin
when the heated air rises due to buoyancy: heat is converted to work. Rubbing
your hands makes them warmer: work is converted to heat. Humankind has
a long and rich history of making use of both conversions. Friction between a
fast spun stick and a resting piece of wood is used since millennia to create a
fire. Technical applications of heat to work conversions are abundant through
history, and our modern life is unthinkable without heat engines such as steam
and gas turbines for generation of electricity, or car and aircraft engines
for transport. In cooling engines work is used to withdraw heat, such as in
refrigerators or in air conditioning devices.
</p>
<p>The evaporation of water to steam by heating provides a large change in
volume and/or pressure. Devices using this effect were known already more
than 2000 years ago, but they became prevalent with the development of the
steam engine. Thermodynamics was initially developed to better understand
the processes in steam engines and other conversion devices, so that the
understanding can be used to improve the engines.
</p>
<p>While the heat-to-work and work-to-heat conversions are readily observ-
able in simple and more complex processes, the governing law is not at all
obvious from simple observation. It required groundbreaking thinking and
careful experiments to unveil the law of conservation of energy. Due to its
importance in thermodynamics, it is also known as the First Law of Ther-
modynamics.
</p>
<p>Expressed in words, the First Law of Thermodynamics reads:
</p>
<p>Energy cannot be produced nor destroyed, it can only be transferred, or
converted from one form to another. In short, energy is conserved.
</p>
<p>It took quite some time to formulate the first law in this simple form, the
credit for finding and formulating it goes to Robert Meyer (1814-1878), James

<p>34 3 The First Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>Prescott Joule (1818-1889), and Hermann Helmholtz (1821-1894). Through
careful measurements and analysis, they recognized that thermal energy, me-
chanical energy, and electrical energy can be transformed into each other,
which implies that energy can be transferred by doing work, as in mechanics,
and by heat transfer.
</p>
<p>The first law is generally valid, no violation was ever observed. As knowl-
edge of physics has developed, other forms of energy had to be included,
such as radiative energy, nuclear energy, or the mass-energy equivalence of
the theory of relativity, but there is no doubt today that energy is conserved
under all circumstances.

<p>Fig. 3.1 Closed system with energy E exchanging work Ẇ and heat Q̇ with its
surroundings
</p>
<p>We formulate the first law for the simple closed system, depicted again
in Fig. 3.1, where all three possibilities to manipulate the system from the
outside are indicated. For this system, the conservation law for energy reads
</p>
<p>dE
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇&minus; Ẇ , (3.1)
</p>
<p>where E is the total energy of the system, Q̇ is the heat transfer rate in or
out of the system, and Ẇ = Ẇpiston+Ẇpropeller is the total power&mdash;the work
per unit time&mdash;exchanged with the surroundings.
</p>
<p>This equation states that the change of the system&rsquo;s energy in time (dE/dt)
is equal to the energy transferred by heat and work per unit time (Q̇ &minus; Ẇ ).
The sign convention used is such that heat transferred into the system is
positive, and work done by the system is positive.
</p>
<p>The SI unit of energy, work, and heat is the Joule, 1 J = 1Nm = 1 kgm
2
</p>
<p>s2 ;
</p>
<p>the SI unit of power and heat transfer rate is the Watt, 1W = 1 Js .
All contributions to the first law (3.1), i.e., energy, work and heat, will be

<p>discussed in detail in the following sections.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.4 Potential Energy 35
</p>
<p>3.2 Total Energy
</p>
<p>The total energy E of the system is the sum of its kinetic energy Ekin,
potential energy Epot, and internal&mdash;or thermal&mdash;energy U ,
</p>
<p>E = U + Ekin + Epot . (3.2)
</p>
<p>Presently, these are the only forms of energy that we need for the description
of thermal processes; other forms of energy that can be relevant are chemical
energy, nuclear energy, radiative energy and electrical energy, which will be
introduced when required.
</p>
<p>We address the different contributions to energy in the next sections.

<p>36 3 The First Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>3.5 Internal Energy and the Caloric Equation of State
</p>
<p>Even if a macroscopic element of matter is at rest, its atoms move (in a gas
or liquid) or vibrate (in a solid) fast, so that each atom has microscopic ki-
netic energy. Moreover, the atoms are subject to interatomic forces, which
contribute microscopic potential energies. These microscopic energies depend
on temperature, and the higher the temperature, the higher the average mi-
croscopic energy. Since the microscopic kinetic and potential energies cannot
be observed macroscopically, one speaks of the internal energy, or thermal
energy, of the material, denoted as U .
</p>
<p>For inhomogeneous states the total internal energy of the system is ob-
tained by integration of the specific internal energy u over all mass elements
dm = ρdV . For homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems we have
</p>
<p>U = mu and U =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>ρudV . (3.7)
</p>
<p>Internal energy cannot be measured directly. The caloric equation of state
relates the specific internal energy u to measurable quantities, it is of the form
u = u (T, v), or u = u (T, p). Recall that pressure, volume and temperature
are related by the thermal equation of state, p (v, T ); therefore it suffices to
know two properties in order to determine the others.
</p>
<p>The caloric equation of state must be determined by careful measurements,
where the response of the system to heat or work supply is evaluated by means
of the first law. For most materials the results cannot be easily expressed as
equations, and are tabulated in property tables, see Chapter 6. Some simple
caloric equations of state will be presented already in Sec. 3.10.
</p>
<p>For inhomogeneous states, where the properties are space dependent, we
assume the validity of the caloric equation of state in the local volume element
dV . This assumption reflects our understanding that the atoms and molecules
of the considered substance are interacting frequently, and thus behave as a
collective, see Sec. 2.2.
</p>
<p>3.6 Work and Power
</p>
<p>Work, denoted by W , is the product of a force and the displacement of its
point of application. Power, denoted by Ẇ , is work done per unit time, that
is the force times the velocity of its point of application. The total work for
a process is the time integral of power over the duration ∆t = t2 &minus; t1 of the
process,
</p>
<p>W =
</p>
<p>&int; t2
</p>
<p>t1
</p>
<p>Ẇdt . (3.8)
</p>
<p>For the closed system depicted in Fig. 2.1 there are two contributions to
work: moving boundary work, due to the motion of the piston, and rotating</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.6 Work and Power 37
</p>
<p>shaft work, which moves the propeller. Other forms of work, e.g., spring work
or electrical work will be discussed as required.
</p>
<p>Work and power can be positive or negative. We follow the sign convention
that work done by the system is positive and work done to the system is
negative.
</p>
<p>Moving boundary work is best computed from a piston-cylinder system,
as depicted in Fig. 3.2; however, the subsequent expressions are valid for
arbitrary system geometries. The force on the piston of cross section A
is pA and thus the work for an infinitesimal displacement ds is given by
δW = pAds = pdV , where dV = Ads is the volume change associated with
the displacement. As the piston is moved, the pressure within the system
might change. Thus, the work W12 for a finite displacement V2 &minus; V1 must
be computed by summing over the infinitesimal contributions δW , that is by
</p>
<p>integration, W12 =
&int;
</p>
<p>δW =
&int; 2
</p>
<p>1 pdV .
</p>
<p>ds
</p>
<p>A
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.2 Moving boundary work in a piston-cylinder system at pressure p, piston
area A, displacement ds. Work is δW = pdV = pAds.
</p>
<p>The power Ẇ is obtained from multiplying the force pA with the velocity
ds
dt of the piston. Since the cross section does not change, we have A
</p>
<p>ds
dt =
</p>
<p>dV
dt ,
</p>
<p>and Ẇ = pdVdt .
Altogether we have the following expressions for moving boundary work
</p>
<p>with finite and infinitesimal displacement, and for power,
</p>
<p>W12 =
</p>
<p>&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>pdV , δW = pdV , Ẇ = p
dV
</p>
<p>dt
. (3.9)
</p>
<p>Here, p is the pressure at the piston; for simplicity we have ignored variations
of pressure along the piston surface.
</p>
<p>Closed equilibrium systems are characterized by a single homogeneous
pressure1 p, a single homogeneous temperature T , and the volume V . In
quasi-static (or reversible) processes, the system passes through a series of
equilibrium states which can be indicated in suitable diagrams. Figure 3.3
shows a pressure-volume diagram (p-V-diagram) of two different reversible
processes connecting the points {p1, V1} and {p2, V2}. Due to the relation

</p>
<p>W12 =

<p>Fig. 3.3 Two reversible processes between points 1 and 2 in the p-V-diagram, and
the corresponding moving boundary work
</p>
<p>The power transmitted by a rotating shaft is related to the torque T and
the revolutionary speed ṅ (revolutions per unit time) as Ẇ = 2πṅT, the
</p>
<p>total work transmitted during a finite time interval is, again, W12 =
&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
Ẇdt.
</p>
<p>The transmission between the shaft and the working fluid is performed by a
propeller (turbines, compressors etc.).
</p>
<p>In a closed system the propeller stirs the working fluid and creates in-
homogeneous states. Fluid friction transmits fluid motion (i.e., momentum
and kinetic energy) from the fluid close to the propeller to the fluid further
away. Due to the inherent inhomogeneity, stirring of a fluid in a closed system
cannot be a quasi-static process.
</p>
<p>This is different in open systems, where fluid is entering and leaving the
system. The motion of the fluid can be used to drive the propeller, which de-
celerates the fluid and transmits work out of the system, or the propeller can
provide work to accelerate the fluid. These flow processes can be reversible.
</p>
<p>In general, there might be several work interactions Ẇj of the system, then
the total work for the system is the sum over all contributions; e.g., for power
</p>
<p>Ẇ =
&sum;
</p>
<p>j
</p>
<p>Ẇj . (3.10)
</p>
<p>Finally we note that mechanical work can be transferred without restric-
tions between systems in mechanical contact:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.8 Heat Transfer 39
</p>
<p>By using gears and levers, one can transfer work from slow moving to
fast moving systems and vice versa, and one can transmit work from
high pressure to low pressure systems and vice versa.
</p>
<p>3.7 Exact and Inexact Differentials
</p>
<p>Above we have seen that work depends on the process path. In the language
of mathematics this implies that the work for an infinitesimal step is not an
exact differential, and that is why a Greek delta (δ) is used to denote the
work for an infinitesimal change as δW . As will be seen in the next section,
heat is path dependent as well.
</p>
<p>State properties like pressure, temperature, volume and energy describe
the momentary state of the system, or, for inhomogeneous states, the momen-
tary state in the local volume element. State properties have exact differen-
</p>
<p>tials for which we write, e.g., dE and dV . The energy change E2&minus;E1 =
&int; 2
</p>
<p>1 dE
</p>
<p>and the volume change V2 &minus; V1 =
&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
dV are independent of the path con-
</p>
<p>necting the states.
It is important to remember that work and heat, as path functions, only
</p>
<p>describe property changes, not states. A state is characterized by state prop-
erties (pressure, temperature, etc.), it does not possess work or heat.
</p>
<p>Quasi-static (reversible) processes go through well defined equilibrium
states, so that the whole process path can be indicated in diagrams, e.g.,
the p-V-diagram.
</p>
<p>Non-equilibrium (irreversible) processes, for which typically the states are
different in all volume elements, cannot be drawn into diagrams. Often irre-
versible processes connect homogeneous equilibrium states which can be in-
dicated in the diagram. We shall use dashed lines to indicate non-equilibrium
processes that connect equilibrium states. As an example, Fig. 3.4 shows a
p-V-diagram of two processes, one reversible, one irreversible, between the
same equilibrium states 1 and 2. We emphasize that the dashed line does
not refer to actual states of the system. The corresponding work for the non-
equilibrium process cannot be indicated as the area below the curve, since
its computation requires the knowledge of the&mdash;inhomogeneous!&mdash;pressures
at the piston surface at all times during the process.
</p>
<p>3.8 Heat Transfer
</p>
<p>Heat is the transfer of energy due to differences in temperature. Experience
shows that for systems in thermal contact the direction of heat transfer is
restricted:
</p>
<p>Heat will always go from hot to cold by itself, but not vice versa.</p>

</p>
<p>This restriction of direction is an important difference to energy transfer
by work between systems in mechanical contact, which is not restricted.
</p>
<p>Since heat flows only in response to a temperature difference, a quasi-static
(reversible) heat transfer process can only be realized in the limit of infinites-
imal temperature differences between the system and the system boundary,
and for infinitesimal temperature gradients within the system.
</p>
<p>The main heat transfer mechanisms are: (a) Heat conduction, where ther-
mal energy is transmitted by microscopic energy exchange between neighbor-
ing particles. (b) Convection, where fluid elements move to hotter or colder
parts of the system and then exchange energy with the new neighborhood.
(c) Radiative transfer, where electromagnetic radiation that crosses the sys-
tem boundaries is absorbed or emitted by the matter inside the system. In
the present context we do not need to discuss the details of these heat trans-
fer mechanisms, which ultimately describe the same thing: energy transfer
driven by temperature difference.
</p>
<p>We use the following notation: Q̇ denotes the heat transfer rate, that is
the amount of energy transferred as heat per unit time. Heat depends on the
process path, so that the heat exchanged for an infinitesimal process step,
δQ = Q̇dt, is not an exact differential. The total heat transfer for a process
between states 1 and 2 is
</p>
<p>Q12 =
</p>
<p>&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>δQ =
</p>
<p>&int; t2
</p>
<p>t1
</p>
<p>Q̇dt . (3.11)
</p>
<p>By convention, heat transferred into the system is positive, heat transferred
out of the system is negative.
</p>
<p>A process in which no heat transfer takes place, Q̇ = 0, is called adiabatic
process.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.10 The Specific Heat at Constant Volume 41
</p>
<p>In general, there might be several heat interactions Q̇k of the system, then
the total heat for the system is the sum over all contributions; e.g., for the
heating rate
</p>
<p>Q̇ =
&sum;
</p>
<p>k
</p>
<p>Q̇k . (3.12)
</p>
<p>Confusion might result between the use of the word heat in everyday lan-
guage, and its use in thermodynamics. In thermodynamics, heat solely de-
scribes a means to transfer energy in response to temperature differences. In
particular we emphasize that heat is not a form of energy, and does not relate
to how hot it might be outside. To say &ldquo;oh, what a heat&rdquo; is common language,
a thermodynamicist will say &ldquo;oh, it&rsquo;s pretty hot outside&rdquo;, or, even better, &ldquo;oh,
the temperature is pretty high today.&rdquo; A state is characterized by its energy
or temperature, a change of state is characterized by heat (transfer).
</p>
<p>3.9 The First Law for Reversible Processes
</p>
<p>The form (3.1) of the first law is valid for all closed systems. When only
reversible processes occur within the system, so that the system is in equi-
librium states at any time, the equation can be simplified as follows: From
our discussion of equilibrium states we know that for reversible processes
the system will be homogeneous, and that all changes must be very slow,
which implies very small velocities. Therefore, kinetic energy can be ignored,
Ekin = 0. Stirring, which transfers energy by moving the fluid and friction,
is irreversible, hence in a reversible process only moving boundary work can
be transferred. As long as the system location does not change, the potential
energy does not change, and we can set Epot = 0.
</p>
<p>With all this, for reversible (quasi-static) processes the first law of ther-
modynamics reduces to
</p>
<p>dU
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇&minus; pdV
</p>
<p>dt
or U2 &minus; U1 = Q12 &minus;
</p>
<p>&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>pdV , (3.13)
</p>
<p>where the second form results from integration over the process duration. We
shall later, in particular in Chapter 7, use this equation extensively to study
reversible processes in closed systems.
</p>
<p>3.10 The Specific Heat at Constant Volume
</p>
<p>We consider a closed system heated at constant volume (isochoric process),
where the first law (3.13) reduces to (recall that U = mu (T, v) and m =
const.)

</p>
<p>v
= &part;u(T,v)&part;T denotes the partial derivative of internal energy with
</p>
<p>temperature at constant specific volume2 v = V/m. This derivative is known
as the specific heat (or specific heat capacity) at constant volume,
</p>
<p>cv =
</p>

<p>&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;T
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>v
</p>
<p>. (3.15)
</p>
<p>To understand this name for cv, we rewrite (3.14) as
</p>
<p>cvdT =
Q̇dt
</p>
<p>m
=
</p>
<p>δQ
</p>
<p>m
. (3.16)
</p>
<p>From this equation we see that cv is the amount of heat required to increase
the temperature of 1 kg of substance by 1K at constant volume. The specific
heat can be measured by controlled heating of a fixed amount of substance
in a fixed volume system, and measurement of the ensuing temperature dif-
</p>
<p>ference; its SI unit is
[
</p>
<p>kJ
kgK
</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>In general, cv (T, v) =
(
</p>
<p>&part;u

</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>v
is a function of temperature and specific vol-
</p>
<p>ume. For incompressible liquids and solids the specific volume is constant,
v = const, and the specific heat is a function of temperature alone. Inter-
estingly, also for ideal gases the specific heat turns out to be a function of
temperature alone, both experimentally and from theoretical considerations.
For these materials the internal energy depends only on temperature, and
integration gives the caloric equation of state as
</p>
<p>u (T ) =
</p>
<p>&int; T
</p>
<p>T0
</p>
<p>cv (T
&prime;) dT &prime; + u0 . (3.17)
</p>
<p>Only energy differences can be measured, where the first law is used to eval-
uate careful experiments. The choice of the energy constant u0 = u (T0) fixes
the energy scale. The actual value of this constant will only become relevant
for the discussion of chemical reactions. Note that proper mathematical nota-
tion requires to distinguish between the actual temperature T of the system,
and the integration variable T &prime;.
</p>
<p>For materials in which the specific heat varies only slightly with temper-
ature in the interval of interest, the specific heat can be approximated by a
suitable constant average cavgv , so that the caloric equation of state assumes
the particularly simple linear form
</p>
<p>2 Due to the abundance of thermodynamic properties, and the freedom to choose
any two of them as variables, one needs to be careful with the notation. In the
present context, internal energy depends on two variables, and when a partial
derivative is taken with respect to one variable, it is customary to indicate the
second variable by a subscript, to condense notation. This notation, where, e.g.,
(

<p>3.11 Enthalpy 43
</p>
<p>u (T ) = cavgv (T &minus; T0) + u0 . (3.18)
</p>
<p>This relation for the caloric equation of state will serve us well in our first
examples.
</p>
<p>For temperatures around the standard environmental temperature T0 =
298K (&equiv; 25 ◦C), the specific heat of air is cairv = 0.717 kJkgK , for liquid water
one finds cw = 4.18
</p>
<p>kJ
kg K . The old unit for heat and thermal energy, the
</p>
<p>calorie [ cal], is defined such that one calorie is the heat required to raise the
temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius (from 14.5 ◦C to
15.5 ◦C at p0 = 1 atm), thus 1 cal = 4.18 J, and 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ.
</p>
<p>3.11 Enthalpy
</p>
<p>In many thermodynamic calculations one encounters the combination U+pV ,
or the mass divided equivalent u+pv, and it is convenient to introduce a name
and a symbol for these. We define the total and the specific enthalpy as
</p>
<p>H = U + pV , h = u+ pv , (3.19)
</p>
<p>where H = mh.
Using enthalpy to replace internal energy, the first law for quasi-static

<p>processes assumes the forms3

<p>dH

and H2 &minus;H1 = Q12 +

<p>V dp . (3.20)
</p>
<p>As an application we consider a closed system heated at constant pressure
(isobaric process), so that dpdt = 0. In this case, the first law reduces to
dH
dt = Q̇, or, since H = mh (T, p),

<p>Here
(

</p>
<p>p

<p>44 3 The First Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>cpdT =
δQ
</p>
<p>m
. (3.23)
</p>
<p>We see that cp is the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of
</p>
<p>1 kg of substance by 1K at constant pressure; its SI unit is
[
</p>
<p>kJ
kgK
</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>For an ideal gas the thermal equation of state gives pv = RT , and the
internal energy u (T ) is a function of temperature alone. It follows that for
the ideal gas also the enthalpy h (T ) = u + pv = u (T ) + RT is a function
of temperature alone. From the definitions of the specific heats (3.15, 3.22)
follows cp = cv + R; for air at T0 one finds c
</p>
<p>air
p = 1.004
</p>
<p>kJ
kgK . For ideal gases
</p>
<p>enthalpy and specific heat are related as
</p>
<p>h (T ) =
</p>
<p>&int; T
</p>
<p>T0
</p>
<p>cp (T
&prime;) dT &prime; + h0 or h = c
</p>
<p>avg
p (T &minus; T0) + h0 , (3.24)
</p>
<p>where the latter relation holds in case of constant specific heat.
For incompressible solids and liquids (v = const.), the specific heats at
</p>
<p>constant pressure and constant volume agree, since
(
</p>
<p>&part;pv
&part;T
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>p
= p
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;v
&part;T
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>p
= 0
</p>
<p>(also see Sec. 16.7 for a more detailed argument), and one writes the specific
heat without an index, c = cv = cp. The specific heat for water will be
denoted as cw.
</p>
<p>While its internal energy depends only on temperature, the enthalpy of an
incompressible substance (constant specific volume v) depends on tempera-
ture and pressure. Indeed, by its definition h = u + pv, enthalpy depends
explicitly on pressure. With h0 as the enthalpy at a reference point (T0, p0),
the enthalpy for an incompressible solid or liquid with constant specific heat
becomes
</p>
<p>h (T, p) = cavg (T &minus; T0) + (p&minus; p0) v + h0 . (3.25)
Note that no substance is truly incompressible, normally the specific volume
changes at least a little bit. This leads to small differences between specific
heats which can be ignored as long as the compressibility is sufficiently small.
</p>
<p>3.12 Example: Equilibration of Temperature
</p>
<p>We apply the first law to the situation depicted in Fig. 2.6. Two bodies A
and B that are initially at different temperatures T̄A and T̄B, respectively,
are brought into thermal contact. After a sufficiently long time, we find that
both bodies have assumed the common temperature T .
</p>
<p>For this problem, kinetic energy is zero, and potential energy does not
change. When the system [A+B] is adiabatically enclosed (Q̇ = 0), and no
work is done (Ẇ = 0), the first law of thermodynamics simply states that
the energy of the system remains constant,</p>

</p>
<p>Thus, the energy of the end state is equal to the initial energy, Uend = Uinit.
For simple incompressible solids the internal energy is given by4 U = mcT ,
</p>
<p>where c denotes the average specific heat (assumed to be a constant) and m
is the mass. The internal energy of the system consisting of the two bodies
is initially
</p>
<p>Uinit = UA + UB = mAcAT̄A +mBcBT̄B .
</p>
<p>To emphasize that the first law does not automatically give equal final tem-
peratures for the two bodies, we write Uend = mAcATA + mBcBTB with
different final temperatures TA and TB. We solve for TA,
</p>
<p>TA = T̄A +
mBcB
mAcA
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>T̄B &minus; TB
)
</p>
<p>, (3.26)
</p>
<p>and see that there are infinitely many solutions for the final temperatures
(TA, TB) that fulfill the first law: conservation of energy alone is not sufficient
to determine the final equilibrium state.
</p>
<p>However, our experience, laid down in the zeroth law, tells us that the
final temperatures agree: TA = TB = T . We find the final temperature as the
weighted average of the two initial temperatures,
</p>
<p>T =
mAcAT̄A +mBcBT̄B
</p>
<p>mAcA +mBcB
,
</p>
<p>with the weights given by the thermal masses mAcA, mBcB. We shall later
employ the second law to find the same result.
</p>
<p>As discussed, a thermometer utilizes the equilibration of temperature. The
act of measurement should not affect the result. To study the relevant con-
dition, let body B be the thermometer, used to measure the temperature of
body A. The final temperature T of body and thermometer can be written
in the alternative form
</p>
<p>T = T̄A +
mBcB
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>T̄B &minus; T̄A
)
</p>
<p>mAcA +mBcB
.
</p>
<p>The measured temperature T is close to the initial temperature T̄A of body
A when mBcB ≪ mAcA. It follows that a thermometer should have consid-
erably smaller thermal mass mc than the body whose temperature is to be
measured.

</p>
<p>3.13 Example: Uncontrolled Expansion of a Gas
</p>
<p>Our next example concerns the uncontrolled expansion of an ideal gas. For
this, we consider an ideal gas in a container which is divided by a membrane,
see Fig. 3.5. Initially the gas is contained in one part of the container at
{T1, p1, V1}, while the other part is evacuated. The membrane is destroyed,
and the gas expands into the container. The fast motion of the gas is slowed
down by internal friction, and in the final homogeneous equilibrium state
{T2, p2, V2} the gas is at rest and distributed over the total volume of the
container. Note that we have no control over the flow after the membrane is
destroyed: this is an irreversible process.

</p>
<p>Fig. 3.5 Irreversible adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas
</p>
<p>The container is adiabatically enclosed to the exterior, and, since its walls
are rigid, no work is transmitted to the exterior. Thus, the first law for closed
systems (3.1) reduces to
</p>
<p>d (U + Ekin + Epot)
</p>
<p>dt
= 0 ,
</p>
<p>or, after integration,
</p>
<p>U2 + Ekin,2 + Epot,2 = U1 + Ekin,1 + Epot,1 .
</p>
<p>Since the gas it at rest initially and in the end, Ekin,1 = Ekin,2 = 0, and
since potential energy has not changed Epot,1 = Epot,2, the above reduces to
U2 = U1. With U = mu, and m = const., the specific internal energy remains
unchanged,
</p>
<p>u (T1, v1) = u (T2, v2) .
</p>
<p>Measurements for ideal gases show that T1 = T2, that is the initial and
final temperatures of the gas are the same. With this, the previous condition
becomes
</p>
<p>u (T1, v1) = u (T1, v2) ,
</p>
<p>which can only hold if the internal energy of the ideal gas does not depend
on volume. This experiment verifies that the internal energy of the ideal gas
is independent of volume, and depends only on temperature, u = u (T ).</p>

</p>
<p>3.14 Example: Friction Loss
</p>
<p>One litre of water in an adiabatic container is stirred such that the initial
average velocity of the water is V1 = 5 ms . Stirring stops, and due to internal
friction and friction between water and container walls the water will come
to rest after a while. The water still moves after the stirrer is removed, but
we have no control over the water motion: this is an irreversible process. We
compute the change of temperature in the equilibration process.
</p>
<p>After stirring stops, the system is isolated, no heat and work are exchanged,
Q̇ = Ẇ = 0, potential energy remains constant,
</p>
<p>dEpot
dt = 0. The energy
</p>
<p>balance (3.1) reduces to ddt (U + Ekin) = 0, so that the total energy U +Ekin
stays constant,
</p>
<p>U2 + Ekin,2 = U1 + Ekin,1 .
</p>
<p>From experience we know that in the final homogeneous equilibrium state
the water is at rest, Ekin,2 = 0, and we find

that this very small temperature change is due only to the destruction of the

temperature considerably; the relevant form for the first law is dUdt = &minus;Ẇ , or
dT
dt = &minus; Ẇmc , where Ẇ is the work required for stirring. A good example from
daily life is the kneading of pizza dough, which can become quite warm.
</p>

</p>
<p>3.15.1 Heating of Water
</p>
<p>2 litre of water at T1 = 20
◦C are heated in a well isolated 2 kW electric kettle.
</p>
<p>We compute the time required to heat the water to T2 = 90
◦C.
</p>
<p>In this temperature range, liquid water can be well described as an incom-
pressible liquid with mass density ρ = 1000 kgm3 and constant specific heat
</p>
<p>cw = 4.18

</p>
<p>kgK . The mass of water in the heater is m = ρV = 2kg. Since the
volume of the water remains unchanged, there is no work done, and with the

</p>
<p>3.15.2 Heating of Water with Heat Loss
</p>
<p>We consider the same problem as above, only that now the water in the heater
loses heat to the environment at T0 = 20
</p>
<p>◦C at a rate of Q̇loss = α (T &minus; T0)
with a transfer coefficient α = 25 WK . The heat loss must be added to the heat
supplied by the kettle, so that the first law reads (careful with the sign, the
heat loss must be subtracted)
</p>
<p>mcw
dT
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇&minus; α (T &minus; T0) .
</p>
<p>Since T0, Q̇ and α are constant in time, this differential equation can be

</p>
<p>for α is a bit high for a water heater, which normally can bring water to boil
and evaporate in finite time.
</p>
<p>The heat transfer coefficient α depends on the material, and the system
configuration. Our sense of cold or hot is not a sense of temperature, but
rather a sense of heat transfer. When we touch an object with large heat
transfer coefficient, a large amount of heat is exchanged between our hand</p>

<p>3.15 Example: Heating Problems 49
</p>
<p>and the object, which feels hotter or colder as an object with smaller heat
transfer coefficient at the same temperature. The amount of energy available
plays a role as well. A larger amount of heat can be transferred to our hand
from an object with large thermal mass mc. Wood feels not as cold as metal
of the same temperature.
</p>
<p>3.15.3 Isochoric Heating of an Ideal Gas
</p>
<p>We consider the air-filled room from a previous example which contains
180.94 kg of air, initially at 20 ◦C, 1 atm. We now assume the room is per-
fectly sealed, so that the air volume remains constant, and ask for the total
amount of heat that must be supplied to heat the room to 25 ◦C.
</p>
<p>We describe air as an ideal gas with constant specific heat, so its internal
energy is given by U = mcv (T &minus; T0) + u0, with cv = 0.717 kJkgK . Since the
volume remains constant, no work is done, W12 =
</p>
<p>&int; 2
</p>
<p>1 pdV = 0, and the first
law reduces to
</p>
<p>mcv
dT
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇ .
</p>
<p>Integration gives
</p>
<p>Q12 =
</p>
<p>&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>Q̇dt = mcv∆T = 648.7 kJ .
</p>
<p>A 2 kW heater would need ∆t = Q12/Q̇ = 324 s to heat the air in the room
by 5 ◦C. The heating of a real room takes longer, since a substantial amount
of heat is required to heat the walls, which have a large thermal mass mc,
moreover one will expect heat loss through the walls to the colder outside
environment.
</p>
<p>The pressure after heating is completed, p2, follows from the ideal gas
law pV = mRT . Since mass and volume remain constant we have p/T =
mR/V = const, so that p2/T2 = p1/T1 or p2 = p1T2/T1 = 1.017 atm =
1.0305 bar (temperatures in Kelvin!).
</p>
<p>3.15.4 Isobaric Heating of an Ideal Gas
</p>
<p>Next we ask for the amount of heat required to heat the same amount of air
under constant pressure.
</p>
<p>In this case, the heat is best computed from the alternative form (3.20)
which for constant pressure reduces to
</p>
<p>dH
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇ ,
</p>
<p>where H = mh is the enthalpy of the enclosed air, with h = cp (T &minus; T0) + h0
and cp = 1.004
</p>
<p>kJ
kgK . Integration gives</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50 3 The First Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>Q12 =
</p>
<p>&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>Q̇dt = mcp∆T = 908.3 kJ .
</p>
<p>A 2 kW heater would need ∆t = Q12/Q̇ = 454 s to heat the air in the room,
provided that no heat loss occurs to and through the walls.
</p>
<p>The initial volume is V1 = 150m
3 and the volume after heating follows
</p>
<p>from the ideal gas law pV = mRT . Since pressure and mass remain constant,
we have V2/T2 = V1/T1 and find V2 = V1T2/T1 = 152.6m
</p>
<p>3. The expansion
of the air requires moving boundary work. Since pressure is constant we find
</p>
<p>W12 =
</p>
<p>&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>pdV = p
</p>
<p>&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>dV = p (V2 &minus; V1) = 259.4 kJ .
</p>
<p>In the isochoric case all heat supplied goes to increase the internal energy.
The heat required for isobaric heating is bigger since, while the increase
of internal energy is the same, additional energy is required to provide the
expansion work.

<p>The Second Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>4.1 The Second Law
</p>
<p>In our qualitative description of processes we have already emphasized the
trend of any isolated system towards an unique and stable equilibrium state.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is the quantitative formulation of this
observation. Its importance goes well beyond the computation of the unique
equilibrium states for isolated systems. In particular, as will be seen, it gives
strong restrictions for the efficiency of energy conversion systems, and thus
is of enormous importance for engineering applications.
</p>
<p>The original derivation of the second law through Rudolf Clausius (1822&ndash;
1888) was based on the argument that the direction of heat transfer is re-
stricted and then relied heavily on statements on thermodynamic cycles. The
following derivation postulates an inequality to describe the trend to equi-
librium, and uses arguments on process direction for simple equilibration
processes to identify terms in the postulated equation. This approach allows
us to introduce the second law quite early, before any thermodynamic pro-
cesses and cycles are discussed. With this, entropy and the second law will
be available for the evaluation of processes and cycles from the start. All
equations and conclusions agree to the classical approach, as presented in
most textbooks on engineering thermodynamics, just the order of arguments
is different.
</p>
<p>4.2 Entropy and the Trend to Equilibrium
</p>
<p>To set the stage, we briefly summarize our earlier statements on processes
in closed systems: a closed system can be manipulated by exchange of work
and heat with its surroundings only. In non-equilibrium&mdash;i.e., irreversible&mdash;
processes, when all manipulation stops, the system will undergo further
changes until it reaches a final equilibrium state. This equilibrium state is
stable, that is the system will not leave the equilibrium state spontaneously.

<p>It requires new action&mdash;exchange of work or heat with the surroundings&mdash;to
change the state of the system.
</p>
<p>The following non-equilibrium processes are well-known from experience,
and will be used in the considerations below: (a) Heat goes from hot to
cold. When two bodies at different temperatures are brought into thermal
contact, heat will flow from the hotter to the colder body until both reach
their common equilibrium temperature. (b) Work can be transferred without
restriction, by means of gears and levers. However, in transfer some work
might be lost to friction.
</p>
<p>The process from an initial non-equilibrium state to the final equilibrium
state requires some time. However, if the actions on the system (only work and
heat!) are sufficiently slow, the system has enough time to adapt and will be
in equilibrium states at all times. We speak of quasi-static&mdash;or, reversible&mdash;
processes. When the slow manipulation is stopped at any time, no further
changes occur.
</p>
<p>The behavior of isolated systems described above&mdash;a change occurs until
a stable state is reached&mdash;can be described mathematically by an inequality.
The final stable state must be a maximum (alternatively, a minimum) of
a suitable extensive property describing the system. We call that extensive
property entropy, denoted S, and write an inequality for the isolated system,
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
= Ṡgen &ge; 0 . (4.1)
</p>
<p>Ṡgen is called the entropy generation rate. The entropy generation rate is pos-
</p>
<p>itive in non-equilibrium (Ṡgen &gt; 0), and vanishes in equilibrium (Ṡgen = 0).
The new equation (4.1) states that in an isolated system the entropy will
grow in time (dSdt &gt; 0) until the stable equilibrium state is reached (
</p>
<p>dS
dt = 0).
</p>
<p>Non-zero entropy generation describes the irreversible process towards equi-
librium, e.g., through internal heat transfer and friction. There is no entropy
generation in equilibrium. Since entropy only grows before the equilibrium
state is reached, the latter is a maximum of entropy.
</p>
<p>The above postulation of an inequality is based on phenomenological ar-
guments. The discussion of irreversible processes has shown that all isolated
systems will in time evolve to a unique equilibrium state. The first law alone
does not suffice to describe this behavior. We have seen this in the description
of temperature equilibration in Sec. 3.12, where the first law has infinitely
many solutions for the final temperatures TA, TB, and additional input is
needed to state that TA = TB in equilibrium. Above, we relied on experience
as additional input, the second law is a formalization of that experience. Non-
equilibrium processes aim to reach equilibrium, and the inequality is required
to describe the clear direction in time.
</p>
<p>In the next sections we will extend the second law to non-isolated system,
and identify entropy as a measurable property.</p>

<p>4.4 Entropy in Equilibrium 57
</p>
<p>4.3 Entropy Flux
</p>
<p>In non-isolated systems, which exchange heat and work with the surround-
ings, we expect an exchange of entropy with the surroundings which must be
added to the entropy inequality. We write
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
= Ψ̇ + Ṡgen, with Ṡgen &ge; 0 , (4.2)
</p>
<p>where Ψ̇ is the entropy flux. This equation states that the change of entropy in
time (dS/dt) is due to transport of entropy over the system boundary (Ψ̇) and
generation of entropy within the system boundaries (Ṡgen). This form of the
second law is valid for all processes in closed systems. The entropy generation
rate is positive, Ṡgen &gt; 0, for irreversible processes, and it vanishes, Ṡgen = 0,
in equilibrium, and for reversible processes, where the system is in equilibrium
states at all times.
</p>
<p>All real technical processes are somewhat irreversible, since friction and
heat transfer cannot be avoided. Reversible processes are idealizations that
can be used to study the principle behavior of processes, and best performance
limits.
</p>
<p>Since a closed system can only be manipulated through the exchange of
heat and work with the surroundings, the transfer of any other property,
including the transfer of entropy, must be related to heat and work, and
must vanish when heat and work vanish. Therefore the entropy flux Ψ̇ can
only be of the form
</p>
<p>Ψ̇ = βQ̇ &minus; γẆ , (4.3)
with coefficients β, γ that must be related to system and process properties.
</p>
<p>Equation (4.2) gives the mathematical formulation of the trend to equilib-
rium for a non-isolated closed system (exchange of heat and work, but not of
mass). The next step is to identify entropy S and the coefficients β, γ in the
entropy flux Ψ̇ in terms of quantities we can measure or control.
</p>
<p>4.4 Entropy in Equilibrium
</p>
<p>For quasi-static processes, which are in equilibrium states at all times, the
entropy generation vanishes, Ṡgen = 0, and the equation (4.2) for entropy
becomes
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
= Ψ̇ ; (4.4)
</p>
<p>in quasi-static processes the entropy of a closed system changes by entropy
transfer only.
</p>
<p>With this and (4.3), we have for reversible processes, where Ẇ = pdVdt ,
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
= βQ̇&minus; γpdV
</p>
<p>dt
. (4.5)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58 4 The Second Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>Eliminating heat Q̇ between this, and the first law for quasi-static processes
(3.13), dUdt = Q̇&minus; pdVdt , yields
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
= β
</p>
<p>dU
</p>
<p>dt
+ (β &minus; γ) pdV
</p>
<p>dt
. (4.6)
</p>
<p>This equation relates entropy S to the state properties U and V , and implies
that S (U, V ) is a state property as well. Since pressure p, volume V , temper-
ature T , and internal energy U are related through the thermal and caloric
equations of state, p = p (T, V ), U = U (T, V ), the knowledge of any two of
these determines the others. Thus, entropy, our new property, can be written
as a function of any two of the above properties, e.g., S (T, V ) or S (p, T ) or
S (U, p) or S (U, V ). From the last form, we compute the time derivative of
entropy with the chain rule,
</p>
<p>dS

<p>&part;V
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>U
</p>
<p>dV
</p>
<p>dt
. (4.7)
</p>
<p>Comparison of the last two equations relates β and (β &minus; γ) to the partial
derivatives of entropy,
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;S
</p>
<p>&part;U

</p>
<p>&part;V
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>U
</p>
<p>= (β &minus; γ) p . (4.8)
</p>
<p>So far, entropy and the coefficients β and γ in the entropy flux are not yet
fixed. Since entropy is a state property, also its derivatives
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;S
&part;U
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>V
and
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;S
&part;V
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>U
are state properties, and it follows that β and (β &minus; γ) are state properties as
well.1 Since S, U and V are extensive, their quotients and derivatives must
be intensive quantities; therefore β and γ are intensive quantities. Obviously,
we are interested in non-trivial entropy functions, and therefore we must have
β 
= 0, (β &minus; γ) 
= 0.
</p>
<p>In anticipation of later discussion we introduce the thermodynamic tem-
perature as T = 1/β. At this point, this is a just a definition, however, it will
be shown soon that T has all the characteristics required for the definition of
a thermodynamic temperature. In particular, it will be seen that the entropy
flux term βQ̇ = Q̇/T is related to the restriction of the direction of heat
transfer: heat flows from warm to cold, not vice versa. No such restriction
applies for work, which, by means of gears and levers, can be transmitted
from slow to fast and vice versa, or from low force to high force and vice
versa. Because of this, γ must be a constant, which can be set to γ = 0&mdash;the
interested reader will find the full argument in Sec. 4.17.
</p>
<p>With β = 1/T and γ = 0, we have the partial derivatives of entropy
expressed through measurable quantities,
</p>
<p>1 Note that, when the entropy flux (4.3) was introduced, this was not clear: β and
(β &minus; γ) could in principle depend on work and heat. The argument presented here
shows that this is not so, at least in equilibrium.</p>

<p>)

<p>V

</p>
<p>U
dV becomes
</p>
<p>TdS = dU + pdV . (4.11)
</p>
<p>This relation is known as the Gibbs equation, named after Josiah Willard
Gibbs (1839 - 1903). The Gibbs equation is a differential relation between
properties and valid for all simple substances.
</p>
<p>Since T and p are intensive, and U and V are extensive properties, entropy
is extensive. The specific entropy s = S/m can be computed from the Gibbs
equation for specific properties, which is obtained by division of (4.11) with
the constant mass m,
</p>
<p>Tds = du+ pdv . (4.12)
</p>
<p>Replacing internal energy by enthalpy, u = h&minus; pv, gives an alternative form
of the Gibbs equation,
</p>
<p>Tds = dh&minus; vdp . (4.13)
The Gibbs equation gives a large number of relations and restrictions between
properties, in particular it allows to determine property relations for entropy.
</p>
<p>Entropy, just as internal energy, cannot be measured directly. Property
relations for entropy are computed from the Gibbs equation, and the thermal
and caloric equations of state, p (T, v) and u (T, v). Here, we consider this for
incompressible substances and for ideal gases.
</p>
<p>For incompressible liquids and solids, the specific volume is constant, hence
dv = 0. The caloric equation of state (3.18) implies du = cdT and the Gibbs
equation reduces to Tds = cdT . For constant specific heat, c = const., inte-
gration gives entropy as explicit function of temperature,
</p>
<p>s (T ) = c ln
T
</p>
<p>T0
+ s0 , (4.14)
</p>
<p>where s0 is the entropy at the reference temperature T0. As long as no chem-
ical reactions are involved, the definition of the entropy scale, i.e., the value
of s0, can be freely chosen; the third law of thermodynamics will fix the scale
properly.
</p>
<p>For an ideal gas we have du = cvdT and v = RT/p so that the Gibbs
equation (4.13) becomes</p>

entropy is a state property, i.e., dS is an exact differential. In the language
of mathematics, the inverse thermodynamic temperature 1T serves as an in-
tegrating factor for δQ, such that dS = 1T δQ becomes an exact differential.
</p>
<p>From the above, we see that for reversible processes δQ = TdS. Accord-
ingly, the total heat exchanged in a reversible process can be computed
from temperature and entropy as the area below the process curve in the

constant in the process. We say a reversible adiabatic process is isentropic.
The process curve in the T-S-diagram is a vertical line, see Fig. 4.2.
</p>
<p>4.7 The Entropy Balance
</p>
<p>In the previous sections, we considered homogeneous systems that undergo
equilibrium processes. To generalize for processes in inhomogeneous systems,
we consider the system as a compound of sufficiently small subsystems. The
key assumption is that each of the subsystems is in local equilibrium, so that
it can be characterized by the same state properties as a macroscopic equilib-
rium system. To simplify the proceedings somewhat, we consider numbered
subsystems of finite size, and summation. A more refined argument would
consider infinitesimal cells dV , and integration.</p>

system i inside the system and a subsystem k at the system boundary. Tem-
perature and pressure in the subsystems are given by Ti, pi and Tk, pk,
respectively. Generally, temperature and pressure are inhomogeneous, that
is adjacent subsystems have different temperatures and pressures. Accord-
ingly, each subsystem interacts with its neighborhood through heat and work
transfer as indicated by the arrows. Heat and work exchanged with the sur-
roundings of the system are indicated as Q̇k and Ẇk.

</p>
<p>Internal energy and entropy in a subsystem i are denoted as Ei and Si, and,
since both are extensive, the corresponding quantities for the complete system
are obtained by summation over all subsystems, E =
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>iEi, S =
&sum;
</p>
<p>i Si. Note
that in the limit of infinitesimal subsystems the sums become integrals, as in

<p>j Q̇i,j is the net heat exchange, and Ẇi =
&sum;
</p>
<p>j Ẇi,j is the net
work exchange for the subsystem. Here, the summation over j indicates the
exchange of heat and work with the neighboring cells, such that, e.g., Q̇i,j is
the heat that i receives from the neighboring cell j.

the corresponding laws for the subsystems, which gives

</p>
<p>In the above Q̇k is the heat transferred over a system boundary which has
temperature Tk. As will be explained next, the summation over k concerns
only heat and work exchange with the surroundings.
</p>
<p>Since energy is conserved, the internal exchange of heat and work between
subsystems cancels in the conservation law for energy (4.23). For instance,
in the exchange between neighboring subsystems i and j, Qi,j is the heat
that i receives from j and Wi,j is the work that i does on j. Moreover, Qj,i
is the heat that j receives from i and Wj,i is the work that j does on i.
Since energy is conserved, no energy is added or lost in transfer between i
and j, that is Qi,j = &minus;Qj,i and Wi,j = &minus;Wj,i. Accordingly, the sums vanish,
Qi,j+Qj,i = 0 and Wi,j+Wj,i = 0. Extension of the argument shows that the
internal exchange of heat and work between subsystems adds up to zero, so
that only exchange with the surroundings, indicated by subscript k, appears
in (4.23).
</p>
<p>Entropy, however, is not conserved, but may be produced. Exchange of
heat and work between subsystems, if irreversible, will contribute to the en-
tropy generation rate Ṡgen. Thus, the total entropy generation rate Ṡgen of
the compound system is the sum of the entropy generation rates in the sub-
systems Ṡgen,i plus additional terms related to the energy transfer between
</p>
<p>subsystems, Ṡgen =
&sum;
</p>
<p>i Ṡgen,i+
&sum;
</p>
<p>i,j
Q̇i,j
Ti
</p>
<p>. In simple substances, entropy gen-
eration occurs due to internal heat flow and internal friction. We repeat that
entropy generation is strictly positive, Ṡgen &gt; 0, in irreversible processes, and
</p>
<p>is zero, Ṡgen = 0, in reversible processes.
To fully quantify entropy generation, that is to compute its actual value,
</p>
<p>requires the detailed local computation of all processes inside the system from
the conservation laws and the second law as partial differential equations.
The derivation and analysis of the local laws is a topic of Non-equilibrium
Thermodynamics.
</p>
<p>The above derivation of the second law equation (4.24) relies on the
assumption that the equilibrium property relations for entropy are valid lo-
cally also for non-equilibrium systems. This local equilibrium hypothesis&mdash;
equilibrium in a subsystem, but not in the compound system&mdash;works well
for most systems in technical thermodynamics. It should be noted that the
assumption breaks down for extremely strong non-equilibria; this lies outside
the scope of our endeavours.

conductor, which is the thermodynamic system to be evaluated. A pure heat
transfer problem is studied, where the conductor receives the heat flows Q̇H
and Q̇L, and exchanges no work with the surroundings, Ẇ = 0. The first and
second law (4.23, 4.24) applied to the heat conductor read

&minus; Q̇L

&minus; Q̇H
</p>
<p>TH
= Ṡgen &ge; 0 . (4.25)
</p>
<p>For steady state conditions no changes over time are observed in the conduc-
tor, so that dUdt =
</p>
<p>dS
dt = 0. The first law shows that the heat fluxes must be
</p>
<p>equal in absolute value, but opposite in sign,
</p>
<p>Q̇H = &minus;Q̇L = Q̇ . (4.26)
</p>
<p>With this, the second law reduces to the inequality

</p>
<p>= Ṡgen &ge; 0 . (4.27)
</p>
<p>Clausius&rsquo; original derivation of the second law is based on the statement
that heat will go from hot to cold by itself, but not vice versa. We shall use
this statement to learn more on thermodynamic temperature T . Since we
declared TH as the temperature of the hotter reservoir, heat should go from
the reservoir at TH to the reservoir at TL. According to Fig. 4.4 the proper
direction of heat transfer in accordance to Clausius&rsquo; statement is for positive
Q̇H , that is for Q̇ &gt; 0, which implies Q̇L &lt; 0. With Q̇ &gt; 0 the inequality

<p>The sign of temperature follows from the observation that a stirred substance
will come to rest due to friction with the container walls, and within the fluid.
When coffee, or any other liquid, is stirred, it will spin a while after the spoon
is removed. The motion will slow down because of internal friction, and finally
the coffee will be at rest in the cup. The second law should describe this well-
known behavior, which is observed in all viscous fluids.
</p>
<p>With the fluid in motion, we have to account for the kinetic energy of
the swirling, which must be computed by summation (i.e., integration), of the

tion, but not gained. Figure 4.7 shows the work and heat flows for a gearbox

The figure shows absolute values for work, the arrows indicate the direction
of the work flows. The first law is straightforward to evaluate: Since the gear
box operates at steady state, the energy supply must equal the energy loss.
The statement of the first law can be read straight from the figure: Energy

area A. This relation, which we already used in an example, is known as New-
ton&rsquo;s law of cooling, and is often used in heat transfer problems. The values of
the positive coefficient α must be found from the detailed configuration and

</p>
<p>conditions in the heat transfer system. The surface area A appears due to the
intuitive expectation that enlarging the transfer area leads to a proportional
increase in the amount of heat transferred.
</p>
<p>Heat transfer was introduced as energy transfer due to temperature dif-
ference with heat going from hot to cold, Newton laws of cooling states that
as a result of the temperature difference one will observe a response, namely
the heat flux.
</p>
<p>The procedure to derive Newton&rsquo;s law of cooling can be described as fol-
lows: The entropy generation rate (4.27) is interpreted as the product of
a thermodynamic force&mdash;here, the temperature difference (TH &minus; TL)&mdash;and a
corresponding flux&mdash;here, the heat flux Q̇. To ensure positivity of the entropy
generation rate, the flux must be proportional to the force, with a positive
factor αA that must be measured. The same strategy can be used for other
force-flux pairs.
</p>
<p>With Newton&rsquo;s law of cooling it is easy to see that heat transfer over
finite temperature differences is an irreversible process. Indeed, the second
law (4.27) gives with (4.35)
</p>
<p>Ṡgen = Q̇
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>TL

</p>
<p>TH
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>= αA
(TH &minus; TL)2
</p>
<p>TLTH
&gt; 0 . (4.36)
</p>
<p>Only when the temperature difference is infinitesimal, i.e., TH = TL + dT ,
entropy generation can be ignored, and heat transfer can be considered as
a reversible process. This can be seen as follows: For infinitesimal dT the
</p>
<p>entropy generation rate becomes Ṡgen = αA
(
</p>
<p>dT
TL
</p>
<p>)2
</p>
<p>. Since quadratic terms in
</p>
<p>infinitesimal differences can be ignored, this implies Ṡgen = 0 (dT &rarr; 0). In
this case, to have a finite amount of heat transferred, the heat exchange area
A must go to infinity.
</p>
<p>4.11 Zeroth Law and Second Law
</p>
<p>While above we considered heat transfer between reservoirs, the conclusion is
valid for heat conduction between arbitrary systems: As long as the systems
are in thermal contact through heat conductors, and their temperatures are
different, there will be heat transfer between the systems. Only when the
temperatures of the systems are equal, heat transfer will cease. This is the
case of thermal equilibrium, where no change in time occurs anymore. This
includes that the temperature of an isolated body in thermal equilibrium will
be homogeneous, where equilibration occurs through heat transfer within the
system.
</p>
<p>The zeroth law states: In equilibrium systems in thermal contact assume
the same temperature. Thus, the zeroth law of thermodynamics might appear
as a special case of the second law. It stands in its own right, however, since
it defines temperature as a measurable quantity.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.13 Example: Uncontrolled Expansion of a Gas 69
</p>
<p>4.12 Example: Equilibration of Temperature
</p>
<p>We return to the problem considered in Sec. 3.12, the equilibration of tem-
perature between two bodies A and B, with initial temperatures T̄A and T̄B.
The first law alone was not sufficient to find the final common temperature,
which will now be obtained from the second law. The compound system A+B
is adiabatic to the outside, so that the second law becomes
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
=
</p>
<p>d (SA + SB)
</p>
<p>dt
&ge; 0 .
</p>
<p>Thus the total entropy S = SA + SB of the system will grow in time until it
will assume its maximum in equilibrium, when no further changes occur.
</p>
<p>For the simple solids under consideration, by (4.14) the entropy is S =
mc ln TT0 , so that
</p>
<p>S = SA + SB = mAcA ln
TA
T0
</p>
<p>+mBcB ln
TB
T0
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>The first law relates the actual temperatures TA and TB of the two bodies
and their initial temperatures T̄A, T̄B through (3.26). With this, the entropy
of the system becomes a function of TB only,
</p>
<p>S = mAcA ln

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Since the entropy of the compound system A+B can only grow, in equilibrium
the entropy assumes the largest possible value, which is obtained from the
condition dSdTB = 0. The evaluation, left as an exercise for the reader, gives
the expected result for the common equilibrium temperature,
</p>
<p>TB = TA = T =
mAcAT̄A +mBcBT̄B

<p>mAcA +mBcB

</p>
<p>4.13 Example: Uncontrolled Expansion of a Gas
</p>
<p>We consider the entropy change for the uncontrolled expansion of an ideal
gas in Sec. 3.13, for which the first law gave T1 = T2. The second law for this
adiabatic process simply reads
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt

</p>
<p>Integration over the process duration yields
</p>

</p>
<p>Ṡgendt = Sgen &ge; 0 .</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>70 4 The Second Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>The total change of entropy follows from the ideal gas entropy (with constant
specific heat), Eq. (4.19) as

</p>
<p>Since in this process the temperature of the ideal gas remains unchanged, the
growth of entropy is only attributed to the growth in volume: by filling the
larger volume V2, the gas assumes a state of larger entropy. Since the container
</p>
<p>is adiabatic, there is no flux of entropy over the boundary (i.e.,
&sum; Q̇k
</p>
<p>Tk
= 0),
</p>
<p>and all entropy generated stays within the system, Sgen = S2 &minus; S1.
</p>
<p>4.14 What Is Entropy?
</p>
<p>The arguments that gave us the second law and entropy as a property cen-
tered around the trend to equilibrium observed in any system left to itself
(isolated system). Based on the derivation, the question What is entropy?
can be answered simply by saying It&rsquo;s a quantity that arises when one con-
structs an inequality that describes the trend to equilibrium. Can there be a
deeper understanding of entropy?
</p>
<p>Before we try to answer, we look at internal energy: When the first law of
thermodynamics was found, the concept of internal energy was new, and
it was difficult to understand what it might describe. At that time, the
atomic structure of matter was not known, and internal energy could not
be interpreted&mdash;it appeared because it served well to describe the phenom-
ena. Today we know more, and we understand internal energy as the kinetic
and potential energies of atoms and molecules on the microscopic level. Thus,
while the concept of internal energy arose from the desire to describe phenom-
ena, today it is relatively easy to understand, because it has a macroscopic
analogue in mechanics.
</p>
<p>Entropy also came into play to describe the phenomena, but it is a new
quantity, without a mechanical analogue. A deeper understanding of entropy
can be gained, as for internal energy, from considerations on the atomic scale.
Within the framework of his Kinetic Theory of Gases, Ludwig Boltzmann
(1844-1905) found a microscopic interpretation of entropy, where entropy
is related to concepts of probability. A not too precise description of this
interpretation follows below.
</p>
<p>Macroscopically, a state is described by only a few macroscopic proper-
ties, e.g., temperature, pressure, volume. Microscopically, a state is described
through the location and momentum of all atoms within the system. The
microscopic state is constantly changing due to the microscopic motion of
the atoms, and there are many microscopic states that describe the same
macroscopic state. If we denote the total number of all microscopic states
that describe the same macroscopic state by Ω, then the entropy of the
macroscopic state according to Boltzmann is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.14 What Is Entropy? 71
</p>
<p>S = kB lnΩ . (4.37)
</p>
<p>The constant kB = R̄/A = 1.3804 &times; 10&minus;23 JK is the Boltzmann constant,
which can be interpreted as the gas constant per particle.
</p>
<p>The growth of entropy in an isolated system, dSdt &ge; 0, thus means that the
system shifts to macrostates which have larger numbers of microscopic real-
izations. Equilibrium states have particularly large numbers of realizations,
and this is why they are observed.
</p>
<p>To make the ideas somewhat clearer, we consider the expansion of a gas
when a barrier is removed, see Secs. 3.13, 4.13. This is a particularly simple
case, where the internal energy, and thus the distribution of energy over the
particles, does not change. Hence, we can ignore the distribution of thermal
energy over the particles, and the exchange of energy between them.
</p>
<p>We assume a system of N gas particles in a volume V . The volume of a
single particle is v0, and in order to be able to compute the number Ω, we
&ldquo;quantize&rdquo; the accessible volume V into n = V/v0 boxes that each can ac-
commodate just one particle. Note that in a gas, where the distance between
individual particles is relatively large, most boxes are empty. Due to their
thermal energy, the atoms move from box to box. The number of microstates
is simply given by the number of realizations of a state with N filled boxes
and (n&minus;N) empty boxes, which is
</p>
<p>Ω (N, V ) =
n!
</p>
<p>N ! (n&minus;N)! . (4.38)
</p>
<p>By means of Stirling&rsquo;s formula lnx! = x ln x &minus; x (for x ≫ 1) the entropy
(4.37) for this state becomes
</p>
<p>S (N, V ) = kB
</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>&minus;N ln N
n
</p>
<p>&minus; (n&minus;N) ln
(
</p>
<p>1&minus; N
n
</p>
<p>)]
</p>
<p>. (4.39)
</p>
<p>Now we can compute the change of entropy with volume. For this, we
consider the same N particles in two different volumes, V1 = n1v0 and V2 =
n2v0. The entropy difference S2&minus;S1 = S (N, V2)&minus;S (N, V1) between the two
states can be written as
</p>
<p>S2 &minus; S1 = kB
[
</p>

)
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1&minus; Nn1
)
</p>
<p>⎤
</p>
<p>⎦ . (4.40)
</p>
<p>In an ideal gas the number of possible positions n is much bigger than the
number of particles N , that is Nn1 ≪ 1,
</p>
<p>N
n2
</p>
<p>≪ 1. Taylor expansion yields the

computed in Sec. 4.13.

<p>It is instructive to compare the number of realizations for the two cases,

<p>. (4.42)
</p>
<p>For a macroscopic amount of gas, the particle number N is extremely large
(order of magnitude &sim; 1023), so that already for a small difference in volume
the ratio of microscopic realization numbers is enormous. For instance for
V2 = 2V1, we find
</p>
<p>Ω2
Ω1
</p>
<p>= 2N .
Microscopic states change constantly due to travel of, and collisions be-
</p>
<p>tween, particles. Each of the Ω microstates compatible with the given
macrostate is observed with the same probability, 1/Ω. The Ω1 microstates
in which the gas is confined in the volume V1 are included in the Ω2 mi-
crostates in which the gas is confined in the larger volume V2. Thus, after
removal of the barrier, there is a finite, but extremely small probability of
</p>
<p>P = Ω1Ω2 =
(
</p>
<p>V1
V2
</p>
<p>)N
</p>
<p>to find all gas particles in the initial volume V1. This
</p>
<p>probability is so small that the expected waiting time for observing a return
into the original volume exceeds the lifetime of the universe by many orders
of magnitude. If we do not want to wait that long for the return to initial
state, we have to push the gas back into the initial volume, which requires
work.
</p>
<p>In generalization of the above, we can conclude that it is quite unlikely that
a portion Vν of the volume is void of particles. The corresponding probability
</p>
<p>is Pν =
(
</p>
<p>V&minus;Vν
V
</p>
<p>)N
. The average volume available for one particle is V̄ = VN ,
</p>
<p>and when Vν = νV̄ we find, for the large particle numbers in an macroscopic
</p>
<p>amount of gas, Pν =
(
</p>
<p>1&minus; νN
)N ≃ e&minus;ν . Thus, as long as Vν is bigger than the
</p>
<p>average volume for a single particle, so that ν &gt; 1, the probability for a void is
very small. Moreover, inhomogeneous distributions are rather unlikely, since
the number of homogeneous distributions is far larger than the number of
strongly inhomogeneous distributions. This is why we observe homogeneous
distributions in equilibrium.

<p>4.15 Entropy and Disorder
</p>
<p>Often it is said that entropy is a measure for disorder, where disorder has a
higher entropy. This can be related to the above discussion by means of the
following analogy: The ordered state of an office is the state where all papers,
folders, books and pens are in their designated shelf space. Thus, they are
confined to a relatively small initial volume of the shelf, V1. When work is
done in the office, all these papers, folders, books and pens are removed from
their initial location, and, after they are used, are dropped somewhere in the
office&mdash;now they are only confined to the large volume of the office, V2. The
actions of the person working in the office constantly change the microstate
of the office (the precise location of that pen . . . where is it now?), in analogy
to thermal motion.
</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the office looks like a mess and needs work to
clean up. Note, however, that the final state of the office&mdash;which appears to
be so disorderly&mdash;is just one accessible microstate, and therefore it has the
same probability as the fully ordered state, where each book and folder is
at its designated place on the shelf. A single microstate, e.g., a particular
distribution of office material over the office in the evening, has no entropy.
Entropy is a macroscopic property that counts the number of all possible
microstates, e.g., all possible distributions of office material.
</p>
<p>A macroscopic state which puts strong restrictions on the elements has a
low entropy, e.g., when all office material is in shelves behind locked doors.
When the restrictions are removed&mdash;the doors are unlocked&mdash;the number of
possible distributions grows, and so does entropy. Thermal motion leads to a
constant change of the distribution within the inherent restrictions.
</p>
<p>To our eye more restricted macroscopic states&mdash;all gas particles only in a
small part of the container, or all office material behind closed doors&mdash;appear
more orderly, while less restricted states generally appear more disorderly. In
this sense one can say that entropy is a measure for disorder.
</p>
<p>In the office, every evening the disordered state differs from that of the
previous day. Over time, one faces a multitude of disordered states, that is</p>

<p>74 4 The Second Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>the disordered office has many realizations, and a large entropy. In the end,
this makes cleaning up cumbersome, and time consuming.
</p>
<p>Our discussion focussed on spatial distributions where the notion of or-
der is well-aligned with our experience. The thermal contribution to entropy
is related to the distribution of microscopic energy em over the particles,
where em is the microscopic energy per particle. In Statistical Thermody-
namics one finds that in equilibrium states the distribution of microscopic
energies between particles is exponential, A exp

</p>
<p>U =
&sum;
</p>
<p>m Aem exp
[
</p>
<p>&minus; emkBT
]
</p>
<p>. One might say that the exponential itself is an
</p>
<p>orderly function, so that the equilibrium states are less disordered than non-
equilibrium states. Moreover, for lower temperatures the exponential is more
narrow, the microscopic particle energies are confined to lower values, and
one might say that low temperature equilibrium states are more orderly than
high temperature equilibria. And indeed, we find that entropy grows with
temperature, that is colder systems have lower entropies.
</p>
<p>4.16 Entropy and Life
</p>
<p>The second law states that systems left to themselves tend to disorder, in
the non-trivial sense discussed above. To leave a system to itself, it must
be isolated from its surroundings, so that no transport of mass and energy
over the system boundaries occurs. For such a system the second law reads
dS
dt &ge; 0, entropy&mdash;disorder&mdash;must increase. A system which is not isolated
can have decreasing entropy. Indeed, for a closed system the second law reads
dS
dt &minus;
</p>
<p>&sum; Q̇k
Tk
</p>
<p>&ge; 0; thus, by suitable manipulation of the system, in particular
cooling (Q̇k &lt; 0), its entropy can decrease, more ordered states are possible.
</p>
<p>Earth itself is not isolated, since it receives an abundance of high tem-
perature energy from the sun in form of radiation (sun surface temperature
TS ≃ 5700K). At the same time Earth emits low temperature energy, also
in form of radiation (Earth surface temperature TE ≃ 300K). This exchange
of energy with Earth&rsquo;s surrounding allows decreasing entropy locally on the
planet. When we assume that the amount of heat received and emitted by ra-
</p>
<p>diation is the same (
∣
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣Q̇
∣
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣), the second law for Earth reads dSdt &ge;
∣

</p>
<p>∣Q̇

</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1
TS
</p>
<p>&minus; 1TE
)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Since TS &gt; TE , the left hand side is negative, Earth&rsquo;s entropy may, but must
not, decrease.
</p>
<p>If entropy is decreasing within a system (which cannot be isolated!), en-
tropy must be growing somewhere else. When a sufficient portion of the
surroundings are included in the system, entropy must grow. The entropy
in the universe, which is a rather large isolated system, is increasing. The
processes in the sun create entropy locally, in the sun.
</p>
<p>Life, most importantly, is fed by the sun. Just think of the human body:
we grow, we learn, and thus keep disorder within the confines of our body</p>
<p/>

<p>4.17 The Entropy Flux Revisited 75
</p>
<p>rather small. As humans are open systems, we maintain a low entropy level
by exchange of mass and energy with our surroundings. Within the larger
system around us, entropy grows, but within the smaller boundaries of our
bodies (and minds!), entropy decreases, or is at least maintained at the same
level.
</p>
<p>The sun is the source of life, since it provides the energy we need to lower
entropy in our open system Earth, and in our open system human body.
Evolution, as an increase of order, does not contradict the second law.
</p>
<p>4.17 The Entropy Flux Revisited
</p>
<p>When we discussed the possible form of the entropy flux Ψ̇ in Sec. 4.3, we
introduced two coefficients β, γ but we soon set them to β = 1/T and γ = 0
in order to simplify the proceedings. In this section, we run briefly through
the proper line of arguments that show that γ must be a constant, which
can be set to zero. The argument also shows that β must depend only on
temperature, must grow inversely to temperature, and must be positive. Thus
β behaves like inverse thermodynamic temperature, which agrees with our
statements above.
</p>
<p>For the argument we split the inhomogeneous system under consideration
into a large number of small subsystems, each with their individual properties,
see Fig. 4.3. With the entropy flux Ψ̇ = βQ̇&minus; γẆ we find the second law for
non-equilibrium systems from summing over subsystems as
</p>
<p>dS(γ)
</p>
<p>dt
+
&sum;
</p>
<p>γkẆk &minus;
&sum;
</p>
<p>βkQ̇k = Ṡgen &ge; 0 , (4.43)
</p>
<p>where S(γ) is the entropy for this choice of flux. As before, Q̇k, Ẇk denote the
exchange of heat and work with the surroundings of the system, and βk, γk
are the corresponding values of the unknown coefficients in the sub-systems
at the system boundaries. All internal exchange of heat and work between
the subsystems must be such that entropy is generated. The corresponding
terms are absorbed in the entropy generation rate Ṡgen. The first law for the
system is given in (4.23).
</p>
<p>We consider the above form (4.43) of the second law for a heat conductor.
For steady state heat transfer without any work exchange between a hot
reservoir (H) and a cold reservoir (L) through the heat conductor, the above
reduces to
</p>
<p>&minus;βHQ̇H &minus; βLQ̇L = Ṡgen &ge; 0 . (4.44)
Here, βH and βL are the values of β at the hot and cold sides of the conductor,
respectively. The first law gives Q̇H = &minus;Q̇L = Q̇ so that
</p>
<p>(βL &minus; βH) Q̇ = Ṡgen &ge; 0 . (4.45)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>76 4 The Second Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>Since heat must go from hot to cold, the heat must be positive, Q̇ &gt; 0, which
requires (βL &minus; βH) &gt; 0. Thus, the coefficient β must be smaller for the part
of the system which is in contact with the hotter reservoir. This must be so
irrespective of the values of any other properties at the system boundaries
(L,H). Therefore β must depend on temperature only.
</p>
<p>It follows that β must be a decreasing function of temperature alone, if
temperature of hotter states is defined to be higher. The left part of Fig. 4.9
shows a schematic of the heat transfer process.

<p>Fig. 4.9 Heat transfer through a heat conductor HC (left) and transmission of
work through a steady state system S (right)
</p>
<p>We proceed with the discussion of the coefficient γ. For this, we turn our
attention to the transmission of work. The right part of Fig. 4.9 shows two
&ldquo;reservoirs&rdquo; characterized by different values γI, γII between which work is
transmitted by a steady state system S. The direction of work transfer is not
restricted: by means of gears and levers work can be transmitted from low
to high force and vice versa, and from low to high velocity and vice versa.
Therefore, transmission might occur from I to II, and as well from II to I.
Accordingly, there is no obvious interpretation of the coefficient γ.
</p>
<p>Friction might occur in the transmission. Thus, in the transmission process
</p>
<p>we expect some work lost to frictional heating, therefore

N blocks of different metals with masses mi, specific heats ci and tempera-
tures Ti are enclosed in an adiabatic rigid chamber. All blocks are brought
into thermal contact. Use the first and second law to show that in equilibrium
all blocks must have the same temperature.
</p>
<p>Hint: In equilibrium entropy must be a maximum. Since energy is con-
served, entropy must be maximized under the constraint of given energy.
The most elegant way to solve the problem is using the method of Lagrange

the system in a thermodynamic equilibrium state, and if so, why? If not,
what is the system&rsquo;s thermodynamic equilibrium state, and why? Does your

<p>Energy Conversion and the Second
Law
</p>
<p>5.1 Energy Conversion
</p>
<p>In the preceding sections we have evaluated the second law with respect
to its ability for the description of basic equilibration processes, e.g., the
equilibration of temperature, the direction of heat transfer, the dissipation of
kinetic energy, and friction losses in gears. Now we shall apply thermodynamic
analysis to conversion processes between work and heat.
</p>
<p>The science of thermodynamics emerged from an engineering question:
How much work can be obtained from a given amount of heat? This question
arose when the first steam engines were built, which had efficiencies of only a
few percent. The question is still of outmost importance, as a sustainable way
of living requires the optimal use of resources. Having a good understanding
of the possibilities and limitations in energy conversion processes is the first
step in building better&mdash;more efficient&mdash;engines.
</p>
<p>Before we discuss more complex energy conversion processes, we consider a
relatively simple problem: Energy conversion processes between two thermal
reservoirs at different temperatures TH and TL, with TH &gt; TL.
</p>
<p>The natural environment, usually assumed to be at T0 = 25
◦C, is the
</p>
<p>prototype of a thermal reservoir. Due to its size, the environment has al-
most infinite thermal mass mcv, and hence it can provide or accept a large
amount of heat without changing its temperature. Ultimately, all systems are
in thermal contact with the natural environment, and it serves as heat sink
or source for most energy conversion processes.
</p>
<p>Many of today&rsquo;s heat engines rely on the combustion of a fuel (coal, oil,
gas). Combustion processes do not create a reservoir of constant high tem-
perature, but rather a flow of hot combustion gases that provides heat at
varying temperature. Therefore, the following considerations are not always
directly applicable to combustion systems. Nevertheless, the subsequent sec-
tions give important and relevant insights, to which we shall come back again
and again.

</p>
<p>Pure heat transfer between the two reservoirs was discussed already in Sec.
4.8, with the statement that by itself heat goes from warm to cold, but cannot
go from cold to warm. We now consider processes that involve heat and work.
The systems considered are engines that operate at steady state, that is they
do not accumulate or loose energy or entropy over time, dEdt =
</p>
<p>dS
dt = 0. The
</p>
<p>detailed processes inside the engines will be discussed extensively later. For
the present overall evaluation, however, they are of no concern, and thus the
set-up considered is as simple as shown in Fig. 5.1: The thermal engine E
exchanges heat with both reservoirs, and produces or consumes power. The
direction of the arrows in Fig. 5.1 simply indicates the convention for heat
and work: heat in and work out are positive. In the following figures, however,
we will use absolute values of heat and work, and the direction of the flows
will be indicated by the directions of the arrows.

<p>Fig. 5.2 Heat and work directions in a heat engine
</p>
<p>According to (5.2), for given TH , TL, the work output is larger for smaller
entropy generation rate Ṡgen &ge; 0. Entropy generation is due to heat transfer
and friction processes within the engine, and between engine and reservoirs,
and cannot be totally avoided in real engines. Instead, the engineering task
is to minimize entropy generation within the system as much as possible, in
order to achieve the best possible performance of the engine. The work loss
to irreversibilities is proportional to the entropy generation,
</p>
<p>Ẇloss = TLṠgen &ge; 0 . (5.3)
</p>
<p>The theoretical limit for the power generated from two reservoirs with
constant temperatures is obtained for Ṡgen = 0, that is for a fully reversible
engine, as
</p>
<p>ẆC =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1&minus; TL
TH
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>Q̇H . (5.4)
</p>
<p>This is the work output of a Carnot engine, named after Sadi Carnot (1796-
1832), who established this theoretical limit. Any entropy generation Ṡgen in
</p>
<p>the engine reduces the work output by TLṠgen.
To quantify the performance of engines, it is useful to define dimensionless
</p>
<p>efficiency measures that compare the output (&ldquo;what you get&rdquo;) to the input
(&ldquo;what you pay for&rdquo;). For heat engines, accordingly, one defines the thermal
efficiency ηth as the ratio between work output and heat input. For heat
engines operating between two reservoirs, we obtain
</p>
<p>ηth =

&lt; 1 (5.6)
</p>
<p>for the Carnot engine.
The Carnot efficiency ηC is the efficiency of a fully reversible engine oper-
</p>
<p>ating between two reservoirs at constant temperatures. Since it was computed
from general considerations, its value is completely independent of the details
of the engine, i.e., it does not depend on the working fluid used, nor on the
realization of the engine. The Carnot efficiency is a universal limit for the
thermal efficiency any engine operating between two reservoirs at TH , TL
can have. We summarize the above in two statements:
</p>
<p>(a) The thermal efficiency of a fully reversible engine operating between
two reservoirs is independent of the realization of the engine; it is given
by the Carnot efficiency ηC.
</p>
<p>(b) Any engine operating between two reservoirs in which irreversible
processes occur has a thermal efficiency below that of a fully reversible
engine.
</p>
<p>The amount of work produced grows with the temperature ratio TH/TL
between the reservoirs. In technical energy conversion processes one will aim
for high upper temperature TH to ensure high energy conversion efficiency.
At high temperatures material strength is limited, so that the upper tem-
peratures are limited through the materials used for building the engines.
Typically, the lower temperature TL is the temperature of the environment,
T0.
</p>
<p>For temperature ratios TH/TL close to unity, i.e., small temperature differ-
ences, the thermal efficiency is small, and only little power can be produced.
Hence, low temperature waste heat (low TH) is relatively useless for power
production, and, if possible, should rather be used for space heating. High
temperature waste heat (high TH), however, has considerable work potential
that should be used. In other words:
</p>
<p>Energy at high temperature is more valuable than energy at low temper-
ature, since more work can be extracted from it.
</p>
<p>5.3 The Kelvin-Planck Statement
</p>
<p>Even the&mdash;fully reversible&mdash;Carnot engine has a thermal efficiency ηC below
unity: Not all heat received from the hot reservoir can be converted into
work, some heat must be rejected to a colder reservoir. The Kelvin-Planck
formulation of the second law states this as follows:
</p>
<p>No steady state thermodynamic process is possible in which heat is com-
pletely converted into work.</p>

pletely converted to heat

steady state process with just one heat exchange the laws require

<p>&minus; Q̇H

</p>
<p>= &minus; Ẇ
TH
</p>
<p>&ge; 0 , (5.7)
</p>
<p>hence heat and work must both be negative. Figure 5.3 shows the forbidden
process, and also the&mdash;allowed&mdash;inverse process, the complete conversion of
work into heat through friction. A typical example for the latter are resis-
tance heaters in which electrical work is converted to heat through electric
resistance.
</p>
<p>5.4 Refrigerators and Heat Pumps
</p>
<p>While heat cannot go from cold to warm by itself, one can use work consum-
ing devices to perform this task, a refrigerator or heat pump as depicted in
Fig. 5.4.
</p>
<p>A refrigerator removes heat from a cold reservoir, e.g., the interior of a
freezer, at TL, and rejects heat to the environment at TH&mdash;the goal is to cool
the cold reservoir. A heat pump is used for space heating, it takes heat from
the environment at TL, and rejects heat into the room that is being heated
at TH . While the values of the temperatures TL, TH differ for refrigerator
and heat pump, both operate according to the same principles.
</p>
<p>With heat being removed from the colder reservoir, and heat rejected into
</p>
<p>the warm reservoir, we have Q̇H = &minus;

COPRH = 1, which is the lower bound for heat pumps. A typical heat pump
has a COP above unity and gives more efficient heating.

<p>5.5 Kelvin-Planck and Clausius Statements
</p>
<p>Clausius&rsquo; statement of the second law says that heat will not go from cold
to warm by itself. Note that the two words &ldquo;by itself&rdquo; are important here: a
heat pump system can transfer heat from cold to warm, but work must be
supplied, so the heat transfer is not &ldquo;by itself.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law says that it is impossible
to construct a device operating at steady state that receives heat from a single
reservoir and produces work. In other words, no heat engine can be build that
has a thermal efficiency of ηth = 1. In our treatment, this statement followed
from the evaluation of the second law, while the Clausius statement was used
explicitly in its development.
</p>
<p>The Clausius statement is a daily experience&mdash;when we touch a hot plate,
we do not expect to get colder hands&mdash;but the Kelvin-Planck statement might
be more difficult to grasp. It is instructive to show that both statements are
equivalent. To this end, we consider the setting shown in Fig. 5.5, consisting

<p>Fig. 5.5 The equivalency of the Kelvin-Planck (K/P) and Clausius (C) statements
of the second law
</p>
<p>combined system [I+ II] is heat transfer from cold to warm &ldquo;by itself&rdquo;, which
is forbidden by the Clausius statement. Both statements are equivalent.
</p>
<p>5.6 Thermodynamic Temperature
</p>
<p>In the derivation of the second law we have introduced thermodynamic tem-
perature T as the factor of proportionality between the heat transfer rate Q̇
and the entropy flux Ψ̇ .
</p>
<p>In previous sections we have seen that this definition of thermodynamic
temperature stands in agreement with the direction of heat transfer: heat
flows from hot (high T ) to cold (low T ) by itself. The heat flow aims at
equilibrating the temperature within any isolated system that is left to itself,
so that two systems in thermal equilibrium have the same thermodynamic
temperature. Moreover, the discussion of internal friction showed that ther-
modynamic temperature must be positive.
</p>
<p>The discussion of energy conversion processes between two reservoirs adds
another requirement for thermodynamic temperature: For any reversible en-
gine operating between two reservoirs, it must fulfill the relation
</p>
<p>TH
TL
</p>
<p>= &minus; Q̇H
Q̇L
</p>
<p>. (5.15)
</p>
<p>This relation follows from (5.1)2 for the case of a fully reversible engine,
Ṡgen = 0, independent of the realization of the reversible engine, or the
working substance employed.
</p>
<p>It is therefore possible, at least in principle, to measure temperature ra-
tios through measurement of the heat exchange in fully reversible engines.
Accordingly, to define the thermodynamic temperature scale, only a single
reference temperature is required.
</p>
<p>The Kelvin temperature scale, named after William Thomson, Lord Kelvin
(1824 - 1907), uses the triple point of water (611 kPa, 0.01 ◦C) as reference.
The triple point is the state at which a substance can coexist in all three</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.8 Reversible and Irreversible Processes 91
</p>
<p>phases, solid, liquid and vapor, see Sec. 6.3. The Kelvin scales assigns the
value of TTr = 273.16K to this unique point, which can be reproduced easily
in laboratories.
</p>
<p>Since thermodynamic temperature cannot be negative, the smallest possi-
ble thermodynamic temperature is 0K, known as absolute zero.
</p>
<p>The ideal gas temperature scale, introduced in Sec. 2.13, coincides with the
Kelvin scale. This will be seen later, in Sec. 8.2, when we explicitly compute
the thermal efficiency of a Carnot cycle operating with an ideal gas.
</p>
<p>5.7 Perpetual Motion Engines
</p>
<p>Perpetual motion engines are engines that violate the first or the second law
of thermodynamics, or both. Naturally, one will never meet these engines
since they are impossible to build&mdash;the thermodynamic laws are not to be
violated! One might meet inventors, however, who claim to have invented
engines that do miraculous things. Inevitably, the inventors will never be
able to show their engines in working condition, and their claims remain
eternally unproven.
</p>
<p>A perpetual motion engine of the first kind is an engine that violates the
first law of thermodynamics, e.g., an engine that produces more work than
</p>
<p>the net heat exchange,

</p>
<p>∣Q̇L
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣.
</p>
<p>A perpetual motion engine of the second kind is an engine that violates
the second law of thermodynamics, e.g., a heat engine operating between two
reservoirs at TL, TH with an efficiency above the Carnot efficiency, η &gt; 1&minus; TLTH .
Violations of the second law are sometimes difficult to understand, and thus
perpetual motion engines of the second kind are more difficult to identify for
not so clever inventors, and their gullible investors.
</p>
<p>5.8 Reversible and Irreversible Processes
</p>
<p>Irreversible processes are associated with entropy generation which reduces
the performance of engines. So far the terms reversible and irreversible were
rather loosely defined in Sec. 2.10. A more exact definition of these terms
will make it easier to identify irreversible processes, and the related losses.
We define:
</p>
<p>A thermodynamic process from state 1 to state 2 is reversible, if the
process can be inverted so that the system returns to its initial state
(state 1), and no changes remain in its surroundings.
</p>
<p>A thermodynamic process from state 1 to state 2 is irreversible, if, when
the system is brought back into its initial state (state 1), changes remain
in its surroundings.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92 5 Energy Conversion and the Second Law
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.6 Upper row: Irreversible expansion of a gas into vacuum. Lower row: The
intial state is recovered by pushing the piston and removing heat. Since the heat
added to the surroundings, Q21, cannot be fully converted into the work needed to
push, W21, changes remain in the surroundings.
</p>
<p>For an example, we return to the uncontrolled expansion of an ideal gas,
which is shown again in Fig. 5.6. We found, in Sec. 3.13, that the internal
energies of initial and final states are the same, U2 = U1, while the gas fills a
bigger volume in the final state, V2 &gt; V1. To return the gas to the initial state,
its volume must be reduced by compression, which requires the (reversible)
</p>
<p>work W21 =
&int; V1
V2
</p>
<p>pdV &lt; 0. The first law for any process from state 2 back to
the initial state 1 reads
</p>
<p>U1 &minus; U2 = Q21 &minus;W21 = 0 ,
</p>
<p>so that the heat Q21 = W21 &lt; 0 must be removed from the system, as
shown in the figure. Thus, the process 2-1 draws the work W21 from the
surroundings and transfers the heat Q21 to the surroundings. The process
would be reversible, if the heat Q21 could be completely converted to the work
W21 by an engine residing in the surroundings. This, however, is forbidden by
the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law, which states that only some
of the heat can be converted to work, but not all. Thus, some extra work
has to be provided to return the system to its original state, the system&rsquo;s
surroundings have changed: the original process is irreversible.
</p>
<p>Heat transfer serves as another example: The heat |QAB| has flown from
a hot body A to a cold body B by itself. To return both bodies to their</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.10 Irreversibility and Work Loss 93
</p>
<p>original state one can use a heat pump, which consumes the work WHP ,
removes the heat QAB from the colder body B, and delivers the heat |Q&prime;AB| =
|QAB|+|WHP | to the warmer body A. After this, body B is in its initial state.
Body A received too much heat, however. To return A into its initial state,
the heat |Q&prime;&prime;AB| = |WHP | must be moved from A to the surroundings. Due to
the Kelvin-Planck statement, the heat added to the surroundings |Q&prime;&prime;AB| can
only provide part of the work |WHP | required to drive the heat pump: the
process is irreversible.
</p>
<p>5.9 Internally and Externally Reversible Processes
</p>
<p>For a sound thermodynamic evaluation of processes it is important to identify
and understand all causes for work loss to irreversible processes. Even if a
process is reversible within the boundaries of the system considered, there
might be associated irreversible processes outside the system boundaries. For
the thorough evaluation of the performance of a system, in particular for
accounting for the associated work losses inside and outside the system, the
following definitions are useful:
</p>
<p>Internally reversible process: No irreversible processes occur inside the
system boundaries.
</p>
<p>Externally reversible process: No irreversibilities occur outside the sys-
tem boundaries.
</p>
<p>Fully reversible process : A process which is both, externally and inter-
nally reversible.
</p>
<p>5.10 Irreversibility and Work Loss
</p>
<p>The thermodynamic laws for closed systems that exchange heat with an ar-
bitrary number of reservoirs read
</p>
<p>d (U + Ekin)
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇0+
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>Q̇k&minus;Ẇ ,
dS
</p>
<p>dt
&minus; Q̇0
</p>
<p>T0
&minus;
&sum; Q̇k
</p>
<p>Tk
= Ṡgen &ge; 0 , (5.16)
</p>
<p>where the heat exchange Q̇0 with a reservoir at T0 is highlighted. Most ther-
modynamic engines utilize the environment as heat source or sink, and in this
case Q̇0 should be considered as the heat exchanged with the environment.
Note that the environment is freely available, and no cost is associated with
removing heat from, or rejecting heat into, the environment. For the heat
engines of Sec. 5.2 and the heat pumps of Sec. 5.4 the environmental tem-
perature is T0 = TL, while for the refrigerators of Sec. 5.4 we have T0 = TH .
</p>
<p>Elimination of Q̇0 between the two laws and solving for work gives</p>

</p>
<p>dt
&minus; T0Ṡgen . (5.17)
</p>
<p>This equation generalizes the findings of the previous sections to arbitrary
processes in closed systems: The generation of entropy in irreversible pro-
cesses reduces the work output of work producing devices (where Ẇ &gt; 0,
e.g., heat engines) and increases the work requirement of work consuming
devices (where Ẇ &lt; 0, e.g., heat pumps and refrigerators). We note the
</p>
<p>appearance of the Carnot factor
(
</p>
<p>1&minus; T0Tk
)
</p>
<p>multiplying the heating rates Q̇k.
</p>
<p>The amount of work lost to irreversible processes is
</p>
<p>Ẇloss = T0Ṡgen &ge; 0 , (5.18)
</p>
<p>sometimes it is denoted as the irreversibility. It is an important engineering
task to identify and quantify the irreversible work losses, and to reduce them
by redesigning the system, or use of alternative processes.
</p>
<p>5.11 Examples
</p>
<p>5.11.1 Entropy Generation in Cooling
</p>
<p>A 2 kg block of copper at T1 = 250
◦C equilibrates with the environment at
</p>
<p>T0 = 20
◦C through heat transfer. The left part of Fig. 5.7 shows a sketch
</p>
<p>of the process, where the system boundary is chosen such that heat is trans-
ferred at the environmental temperature T0. Copper can be considered as
an incompressible solid with constant specific heat c = 0.4 kJkgK , specific in-
</p>
<p>ternal energy u = c (T &minus; T0), and specific entropy s = c ln TT0 . We compute
the amount of heat transferred into the environment, and the total entropy
generated.

<p>Since entropy is generated, an irreversible loss is associated with the process.
The entropy generating process is heat transfer over the finite temperature
difference between copper block and environment.
</p>
<p>5.11.2 Work Generation in Cooling
</p>
<p>In the this example we determine the amount of work that could have been
obtained if the heat was not just transferred, but used to drive a heat engine.
We consider the same block of copper as before, but now the heat is used
to drive a Carnot engine in contact with the environment, as shown in the
right part of Fig. 5.7. In this case, there is no entropy generation, since the
Carnot engine is fully reversible. Thus, the first and second laws read (system
boundaries include the Carnot engine)

</p>
<p>A temperature difference can be used to drive a heat engine. If heat is just
transferred over a finite temperature difference, entropy is created, and the
opportunity to provide work is lost. In this example about 26% of the heat
leaving the copper (QH = 184 kJ) could be converted to work in the best
case. Note that W = T0Sgen, where Sgen is the entropy generation in case
that no work is produced as computed in the previous section.
</p>
<p>5.11.3 Perpetual Motion Engines
</p>
<p>We consider some perpetual motion engines.
(a) A company claims to produce a power generation device that produces
</p>
<p>7 kW of power, takes in 11 kW of heat at a temperature of 840K and rejects
8 kW of heat at 280K.
</p>
<p>We evaluate this claim: The work and heat flows are as in Fig. 5.2. Eval-

</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣ = 8kW the first law is not fulfilled&mdash;
</p>
<p>the device is a perpetual motion engine of the first kind.
(b) Another company claims to produce a power generation device that
</p>
<p>produces 7 kW of power, takes in 10 kW of heat at a temperature of 840K
and rejects 3 kW of heat at 280K.
</p>
<p>We evaluate this claim: The first law is balanced now, we need to check the
second law. The thermal efficiency of the device would be η = Ẇ/Q̇H = 0.7.
The work of a Carnot engine operating between the same temperatures is
ηC = 1 &minus; TL/TH = 2/3. Thus the efficiency claimed is bigger than the
Carnot efficiency, which violates the second law&mdash;this engine is a perpetual
motion engine of the second kind.
</p>
<p>(c) Yet another company markets a refrigeration device that removes 1 kW
of heat from a cold space that is kept at &minus;10 ◦C, and rejects heat into an
environment at 22 ◦C. The company claims a power consumption of 122W.
</p>
<p>We evaluate this claim: The coefficient of performance for a Carnot refrig-
</p>
<p>eration device operating between the same temperatures is COPR,C =
|Q̇|
|Ẇ | =
</p>
<p>1
TH/TL&minus;1 = 8.219 which would give a power consumption of ẆC = 122W.
</p>
<p>Thus, the company claims to have a Carnot refrigeration device. While this
claim does not violate the first or the second law, it stands in contrast to
the fact that any real process is irreversible. Thus, for an actual device one
must expect efficiencies and COP&rsquo;s below the Carnot values, which are the
maxima obtained for fully reversible processes. The company&rsquo;s claim must
be wrong.</p>

<p>5.11 Examples 97
</p>
<p>5.11.4 A Heat Engine
</p>
<p>An engine that operates at steady state between two reservoirs at TH =
750 ◦C and TL = 15 ◦C, has a heat intake of 0.1MW, and rejects 50 kW
of heat to the low temperature environment. We compute the power pro-
duced, the thermal efficiency, the entropy generation rate, and the work loss
to irreversibilities.
</p>
<p>We identify Q̇H = 100 kW and Q̇L = &minus;50 kW. The first law applied to
the engine gives Ẇ = Q̇H + Q̇L = 50 kW. Accordingly, the engine&rsquo;s thermal
</p>
<p>efficiency is η = Ẇ
Q̇H
</p>
<p>= 0.5.
</p>
<p>The second law gives Q̇HTH +
Q̇L
TL
</p>
<p>+ Ṡgen = 0 and thus the entropy generation
</p>
<p>rate is Ṡgen =
|Q̇L|
TL
</p>
<p>&minus; Q̇HTH = 0.076
kW
K . Since Ṡgen &gt; 0, the second law is
</p>
<p>fulfilled.
The thermal efficiency for a Carnot engine operating between the same
</p>
<p>temperatures is ηC = 1&minus; TLTH = 0.718 (Kelvin temperatures!) which is above
the efficiency of the engine, as it must be. A Carnot engine would produce
the power ẆC = ηCQ̇H = 71.8 kW. The work loss to irreversibilities is
Ẇloss = ẆC &minus; Ẇ = 21.8 kW.
</p>
<p>A more instructive way to compute the work loss is as follows: Eliminating
the heat exchange with the environment, Q̇L, between first and second law
gives
</p>
<p>Ẇ =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1&minus; TL

<p>A restaurant refrigerator located in a kitchen at 21 ◦C maintains its inte-
rior at 4 ◦C. The refrigerator consumes 300W of power with a coefficient of
performance COPR = 3. We compute entropy generation and work loss.

<p>The work loss to irreversibilities is Ẇloss = TH Ṡgen = 247.7W; this work is

<p>Note that efficient operation of a refrigerator is not only achieved by in-
creasing its COP, but also by improving the thermal insulation. Indeed, the
heat Q̇L that is removed from the interior has crept in through the insulated
walls of the refrigerator. Better insulation reduces the amount of heat that
must be removed, and thus the work consumption of the refrigerator.

<p>We note that the heat required to keep the home at a comfortable tem-
perature needs to be provided since the home loses the same amount of heat

<p>5.2. Investment Advice
A friend asks whether he should invest in a new start-up company. The
company claims to sell a power generation device that produces 12.5 kW of
power, takes in 21 kW of heat at a temperature of 800K and rejects 13 kW
of heat at 300K. What advice do you give? Why?
</p>
<p>5.3. More Investment Advice
Another friend asks whether she should invest in a company which claims to

uct with the following specifications: For keeping a room at 20 ◦C when the
outside temperature is 30 ◦C the product consumes 0.5 kW to remove 9 kW
of heat. What&rsquo;s your advice here, and why?
</p>
<p>5.5. The Perfect Heater?
A relative needs a new heating system. She shows you a flyer from a company
marketing baseboard heaters. The flyer claims a 100% heating efficiency. Is
that a valid claim? Can your relative find a more efficient alternative? If so,

<p>Properties and Property Relations
</p>
<p>6.1 State Properties and Their Relations
</p>
<p>The thermodynamic laws contain many state properties, e.g. [SI units in
brackets]
</p>
<p>T temperature [K]
p pressure [ kPa]
m mass [ kg]
V volume [m3]
</p>
<p>v = V/m specific volume [ m
3
</p>
<p>kg ]
</p>
<p>ρ = 1v mass density [
kg
m3 ]
</p>
<p>V velocity [ ms ]
u specific internal energy [ kJkg ]
</p>
<p>h = u+ pv specific enthalpy [ kJkg ]
</p>
<p>s specific entropy [ kJkgK ]
</p>
<p>However, only few properties (T, p,m, V,V) can be measured directly, while
many of the quantities that appear in the thermodynamic laws (u, h, s, . . .)
cannot be measured directly.
</p>
<p>Experience shows that state properties are not independent, but are related
through property relations, which depend on the substance. By means of
property relations, thermodynamic quantities (u, h, s, . . .) can be determined
indirectly, through measurement of (T, p,m, V,V).
</p>
<p>Measurements show that for simple substances it is sufficient to know two
properties to find all others. This implies property relations of the form
</p>
<p>p = p (T, v) thermal equation of state
v = v (T, p) thermal equation of state
u = u (T, v) caloric equation of state
h = h (T, p) caloric equation of state
s = s (T, p) entropy

<p>104 6 Properties and Property Relations
</p>
<p>and so on. The thermal and caloric equations of state, p (T, v) and u (T, v),
must be determined in careful measurements, where the measurement of the
latter relies on the first law. In most cases, the equations of state are not
given as explicit equations, but in form of tables. The best known exception
is the ideal gas law, p = RT/v.
</p>
<p>Entropy must be determined from the thermal and caloric equations of
state through integration of the Gibbs equation, which gives a differential
relation between properties, and holds for all simple substances in the form
</p>
<p>Tds = du+ pdv , (6.1)
</p>
<p>or, with h = u+ pv and thus dh = du+ pdv + vdp, in the alternative form
</p>
<p>Tds = dh&minus; vdp . (6.2)
</p>
<p>Property relations can be formulated between any set of three properties.
For instance: Considering the entropy as function of temperature and pres-
sure, s (T, p), together with the thermal equation of state, p (T, v), both can
be combined to s (T, p (T, v)) = s (T, v), that is entropy as function of tem-
perature and volume. Inversion of the caloric equation of state u (T, v) for
temperature yields temperature as a function of energy and volume, T (u, v).
Considering the latter in the entropy expression s (T, v) yields entropy as
function of energy and volume, s (u, v). Solving this relation for energy, yields
energy as a function of entropy and volume, u (s, v). And so on. These are
just some examples of variable changes in property relations. A detailed anal-
ysis of property relations, where variable changes are used to identify deeper
relations between properties can be found in Chapter 16, where it will be seen
that the Gibbs equation substantially reduces the measurements necessary
to produce thermodynamic tables.
</p>
<p>6.2 Phases
</p>
<p>Depending on the conditions, e.g., the values of pressure and temperature,
a substance assumes different phases&mdash;solid, liquid, vapor&mdash;which can also
coexist. We shall need property relations for all individual phases as well as
for the coexisting states.
</p>
<p>Atoms and molecules interact through interatomic potentials φ (r) of the
form depicted in Fig. 6.1. For intermediate particle distances around d, the
particles attract each other, while they repel each other when they are pushed
very close together (r &lt; d). For large distances (r ≫ d), the particles do not
notice each others presence (φ (r) &rarr; 0 for r &rarr; &infin;).
</p>
<p>In a solid, the particles sit at fixed locations in the atomic compound, e.g.,
a crystal lattice, and oscillate around the minimum of the potential. The
interatomic forces are strong, and keep the solid together.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.3 Phase Changes 105
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.1 Interparticle potential φ as function of interparticle distance r
</p>
<p>When the temperature is increased, the oscillations become stronger, and
the particles have enough energy to split the molecular bonds with their
neighbors, while the attractive forces are still significant. The particles can
move freely, but are densely packed with distances close to d. This is the
liquid state.
</p>
<p>At even higher temperatures the particle energies exceed the attractive
potentials which cannot hold the particles together anymore. The particles
move fast at greater average distances. This is the gaseous, or vapor, state.
</p>
<p>In solid and liquid states, the particles are in permanent contact and in-
teraction. While gas particles have a large average distance, they neverthe-
less interact through frequent collisions. The interaction between particles
leads to microscopic exchange of energy and momentum which facilitates the
macroscopic transfer of energy and momentum. The constant redistribution
of momentum and energy between particles drives the system towards the
equilibrium state.
</p>
<p>6.3 Phase Changes
</p>
<p>It is a daily experience that matter changes between phases: ice will melt,
water will boil and evaporate, dew will condense out of moist air, and so on.
</p>
<p>We study the evaporation of liquid water at constant pressure p = 1atm,
as depicted in Fig. 6.2. Water is confined in a piston-cylinder system with a
moving piston, the mass of the piston fixes the pressure in the system.
</p>
<p>We go through the figure from left to right: At temperatures below 100 ◦C
(and above 0 ◦C) only the liquid phase is found, we speak of compressed liq-
uid. Isobaric heat supply increases the temperature of the compressed liquid.
When the temperature reaches 100 ◦C, the water starts to evaporate. Fur-
ther heat supply does not increase the temperature, which still is 100 ◦C,
but leads to more evaporation. As evaporation occurs, liquid and vapor are
in an equilibrium state where both phases coexist, the saturated state. The
corresponding liquid and vapor states are denoted as saturated liquid and</p>

<p>saturated vapor, respectively. Finally, when all liquid is evaporated, further
heat supply increases the temperature of the vapor above 100 ◦C, we speak
of superheated vapor.
</p>
<p>When heat is withdrawn, the opposite process happens: the superheated
vapor will cool down until it reaches 100 ◦C, then vapor will start to con-
dense. After all vapor is condensed, the compressed liquid cools to lower
temperatures.
</p>
<p>The saturation temperature depends on pressure, we write Tsat (p). The
inversion gives the saturation pressure, denoted as psat (T ). In the example
we have Tsat (1 atm) = 100
</p>
<p>◦C and psat (100 ◦C) = 1 atm. Figure 6.3 shows
a sketch of the saturation curve of water in the p-T-diagram. The curve
begins in the triple point (611Pa, 0.01 ◦C) and ends in the critical point
(22.09MPa, 374.14 ◦C).
</p>
<p>For temperatures above the critical temperature, and for pressures above
the critical pressure, a saturated liquid-vapor equilibrium is not possible. In
the critical point all properties agree between vapor and liquid, and above
the critical point only one phase exists, one speaks of supercritical fluid.
</p>
<p>The triple point gives the lowest temperature/pressure at which a satu-
rated liquid-vapor equilibrium is possible; only at this point all three phases,
solid, liquid and vapor, can coexist.
</p>
<p>Apart from the liquid-vapor phase change, i.e., evaporation and conden-
sation, one observes the phase changes between solid and liquid, i.e., melting
and freezing (solidification), and between solid and vapor, i.e., sublimation
and deposition. For each, phase equilibrium is only possible for values of
pressure and temperature T and pressure p on the corresponding saturation
curve, psat (T ).</p>

pressure
</p>
<p>Figure 6.4 shows the saturation curves for water as ice, liquid, and vapor
in a p-T-diagram. Note the large number of different ice phases, which reflect
different lattice configurations.1 Phase equilibria (coexistence of two phases)
are only possible on those curves which are given by the saturation pressure
psat (T ) for the respective phase equilibrium, or, alternatively, by the satura-
tion temperature Tsat (p) which is the inverse function. All three phases can
coexist in only one point, the triple point. Away from the saturation lines
the substance will be in just one of the phases as indicated in the figure. An
interesting information that can be drawn from the diagram is that no liquid
water exists at temperatures below &minus;23 ◦C.
</p>
<p>A particular feature of water is the negative slope of its melting curve
which implies that ice will melt under pressure. This behavior is related to
the volume change: A given amount of ice has a larger volume than the same
amount of liquid water, as can be seen by ice swimming on water. Melting
reduces the volume and thus counteracts the pressure increase. Melting under
pressure might play a role in the flow of glaciers, but does not explain the
slipperiness of ice, see Sec. 17.12.

<p>sublimation is the process of freeze-drying which is used to produce instant
coffee: coffee is frozen at a temperature TC , and then subjected to a pres-
sure pC below the sublimation pressure, pC &lt; psub (TC); this forces direct
evaporation of ice.
</p>
<p>Saturation curves for other substances show the same principal charac-
teristics as those for water, in particular the existence of critical and triple
points. However, for almost all other substances the solid has a smaller vol-
ume than the liquid, and the solid-liquid line has a positive slope. Figure
6.5 shows p-T-diagrams with the saturation lines for sublimation, melting
and vaporization, and indication of the solid, liquid, and vapor regions. For
supercritical fluid there is no distinction between liquid and vapor.
</p>
<p>Phase changes are related to volume changes. For most substances the
volume of the liquid is larger than that of the solid (see the left Fig. 6.5),
with water being an exception (see the right Fig. 6.5). Other substances that
exhibit expansion on freezing are silicon, gallium and bismuth. Vapor vol-
ume is always larger than liquid volume at the same pressure. The volume
differences do not become apparent in the p-T-diagram, where the saturated
states appear as lines, but in the pressure-volume diagram (p-v-diagram). For
a substance that contracts on freezing, such a diagram is sketched in Fig. 6.6.
Saturated state lines in the diagram are indicated. There are two lines for
saturated liquid, one describes phase equilibrium with saturated vapor, the</p>

<p>We could also plot a T-v-diagram, but instead we show, in Fig. 6.7, the p-
v-T-surface of an ordinary substance (contracts on freezing). The p-T-, p-v-,
and T-v-diagrams are just the appropriate projections of the surface.
</p>

</p>
<p>6.4 p-v- and T-s-Diagrams
</p>
<p>An indispensable tool for thermodynamic analysis are plots of processes in
suitable diagrams. The diagrams most often used are the p-v- and the T-s-
diagram. For most processes only liquid and vapor or gas phases are encoun-
tered, and thus one uses diagrams that only show liquid and vapor states,
and the corresponding two-phase region.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.8 shows both diagrams including saturation lines and critical point.
Isothermal lines (constant temperature) are sketched in the p-v-diagram, and
isobaric lines (constant pressure) are sketched in the T-s-diagram. Note that
both are horizontal in the two-phase region, where pressure and temperature
are related through the saturation equation p = psat (T ). Obviously, in the
p-v-diagram constant pressure lines are horizontal, and constant volume lines
are vertical; in the T-s-diagram constant temperature lines are horizontal, and
constant entropy lines are vertical.</p>

<p>6.5 Saturated Liquid-Vapor Mixtures
</p>
<p>For technical applications the most important phase change is that between
liquid and vapor; it is, e.g., employed in steam power plants and vapor re-
frigeration systems. We describe the properties of liquid-vapor mix in detail.
Other phase equilibria, e.g., liquid-solid equilibrium, can be treated along the
same lines.
</p>
<p>We consider a mass m of a substance at temperature T and saturation
pressure psat (T ) in liquid-vapor equilibrium. In phase equilibrium, saturated
liquid and vapor can either be separated, with the liquid on the bottom of
the container, or they can be mixed, with the liquid dispersed as droplets in
the vapor, see Fig. 6.9. The mass of substance in the liquid phase is mf , and
the mass of substance in the vapor phase is mg, where mf +mg = m. The use
of the indices f (for fluid) and and g (for gaseous) stems from a time when
the word fluid was synonymous with liquid, while the word today includes
gaseous states as well.
</p>
<p>The specific volumes of the saturated liquid and vapor are vf (T ) and
vg (T ), respectively,
</p>
<p>2 and thus the total volume of the saturated mixture is
</p>
<p>V = mfvf +mgvg . (6.3)
</p>
<p>The specific volume of the mixture is obtained by division with the total
mass,
</p>
<p>v =
V
</p>
<p>m
=
</p>
<p>mf
m
</p>
<p>vf +
mg
m
</p>
<p>vg = (1&minus; x) vf + xvg . (6.4)
</p>
<p>Here, we have introduced
</p>
<p>2 Normally, specific volume is a function of temperature and pressure, v (T, p). For
saturated states, however, the pressure is the saturation pressure psat (T ) which
is a function of temperature. Therefore the specific volume of a saturated state
is a function only of temperature. The same holds for other specific quantities
(energy, enthalpy, entropy).</p>

<p>Property data for saturated states are listed in tables, either ordered by
temperature (&ldquo;temperature table&rdquo;, with p = psat (T )) or by pressure (&ldquo;pres-
sure table&rdquo;, with T = Tsat (p)). Figure 6.10 shows an excerpt of a temperature
table and Fig. 6.11 shows an excerpt of a pressure table, both for water. Sat-
uration tables for other substances are widely available.
</p>
<p>Property data for internal energy and enthalpy is determined from ex-
periments by evaluating the first law, which only allows to determine en-
ergy or enthalpy differences. Therefore, in designing a property table, one
has the freedom to choose the value of a reference energy. For the tables
shown, the internal energy of the saturated liquid at the triple point was
chosen as uf (TTr) = 0. All other energy and enthalpy values refer to this
choice. Entropy is determined from integration of the Gibbs equation, and
one has a choice of an integrating constant, which was chosen here such that,
sf (TTr) = 0. Often, the reference value used in tables is determined from the
third law (Sec. 23.6).
</p>
<p>Care has to be taken when one uses data from different tables, since these
might rely on different choices for the energy and entropy references, which
will lead to errors, if not properly corrected.
</p>
<p>6.6 Identifying States
</p>
<p>Quality can only have values between 0 and 1. If one finds values outside this
range, one either has compressed liquid, or superheated vapor.
</p>
<p>A state of given temperature T for which another property (v or u or h or
s) is known, is compressed liquid for
</p>
<p>v &lt; vf (T ) or u &lt; uf (T ) or h &lt; hf (T ) or s &lt; sf (T ) ,
</p>
<p>and it is superheated vapor if

<p>and it is superheated vapor if

</p>
<p>It is a useful exercise to verify the above conditions by means of p-v-, T-s-,
and p-T-diagrams!
</p>
<p>6.7 Example: Condensation of Saturated Steam
</p>
<p>As an example we consider the isochoric (constant volume) condensation of
saturated steam from an initial temperature of T1 = 280
</p>
<p>◦C to T2 = 200 ◦C.
In the initial state, the properties are just at the saturation values, which can
be read from Fig. 6.10 as</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>The values of two properties&mdash;two bits of information&mdash;are required to fix
a state. In state 1 these are the temperature and the knowledge that the
steam is saturated. For state 2, we know its temperature T2, and its volume,
which is unchanged, v2 = v1. To learn more about the final state, it is best
to draw the process into a p-v-diagram. As shown in Fig. 6.12, the isochoric
process to lower temperature is a vertical line downwards from the saturated
vapor curve, and the final state 2 lies in the two-phase region between the
saturation lines. Hence, this state is a mixture of saturated liquid at volume
vf (T2), and saturated vapor at volume vg (T2), which we find from the table
</p>
<p>as vf (T2) = 0.001157

</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 6.12 Isochoric cooling of saturated vapor between T1 and T2 in the p-v-
diagram. The final state 2 is in the two-phase region (mixture of saturated liquid
and saturated vapor).
</p>
<p>Since v2 = v1 = vg (T1), the quality of the final state is
</p>
<p>x2 =
v2 &minus; vf (T2)
</p>
<p>vg (T2)&minus; vf (T2)
=
</p>
<p>0.03017&minus; 0.001157
0.12736&minus; 0.001157 = 0.23 .
</p>
<p>With this value for quality we find the properties at the end point as</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>s2 = sf (T2) + x2sfg (T2) = 3.274

</p>
<p>kgK
.
</p>
<p>The values for uf (T2) , ufg (T2) etc. are taken from the table. The verification
of the above results is left to the reader.
</p>
<p>We recall that quality must have values between 0 and 1. If one computes
a quality outside this range, the corresponding state is not a saturated state,
but either compressed liquid or superheated vapor, for which the property
data must be found in the appropriate tables.
</p>
<p>6.8 Superheated Vapor
</p>
<p>For superheated vapors the equations of state depend on two properties, and
are normally laid down in extensive tables, or in computer software. Figure
6.13 shows an excerpt of a table with data for water vapor at some pressures
between 10 kPa and 20MPa.
</p>
<p>As an example we consider the adiabatic reversible compression of satu-
rated vapor at T1 = 100
</p>
<p>◦C to a pressure p2 = 3MPa. From the second law
for reversible processes, δq = Tds follows that such a process is isentropic
(constant entropy), and thus it is a natural choice to draw the process curve
in a T-s-diagram as depicted in Fig. 6.14. Clearly, the final state 2 is outside
the two phase region, to the right, which means the final state is superheated
vapor. The properties of state 1 can be read from the saturation table in
Fig. 6.10 as

</p>
<p>Two bits of information are required to identify state 2, and here these are
its pressure, p2, and its entropy, since the process is isentropic, s2 = s1 =
7.3549 kJkgK . In the table for superheated water vapor, Fig. 6.13, we have to
consider the center box which refers to the pressure 3MPa. The required
value for entropy cannot be found in the table, but lies between values given.
The values closest above and below the required value of s2 = 7.3549
</p>

</p>
<p>Figure 6.15 shows a sketch of the function s (p2, T ) in a diagram, with the
tabled data points sa, sb and the target point s2 indicated. Assuming that
the line a &minus; 2 &minus; b can be well approximated by a straight line, we find the
target temperature T2 by linear interpolation as
</p>
<p>T2 = Ta +
s2 &minus; sa
sb &minus; sa
</p>
<p>(Tb &minus; Ta) = 543.1 ◦C .
</p>
<p>Correspondingly, the values for volume, internal energy, and enthalpy are
computed by interpolation as

<p>Fig. 6.15 Linear interpolation
</p>
<p>Here, va = v (p2, Ta), ua = u (p2, Ta) etc. are the appropriate data values
from the table.
</p>
<p>Since the process is adiabatic, we have q12 = 0 and the work per unit mass
can be computed from the first law as w12 = u1 &minus; u2 + q12 = &minus;679.5 kJkg .
</p>
<p>Thermodynamic properties are often listed in tables as discrete values, and
interpolation must be frequently used. Typically, tabulated values are spaced
such that the assumption of linearity is valid in good approximation.
</p>
<p>6.9 Compressed Liquid
</p>
<p>For compressed liquid, i.e., the pure liquid state, only few tables are available,
Fig. 6.16 shows a table for compressed liquid water.
</p>
<p>Most liquids, including water, are almost incompressible for a wider range
of pressures, and this allows us to develop useful approximations that relate
compressed liquid properties to those of saturated liquid.
</p>
<p>For incompressible fluids a change of pressure does not lead to a change
of volume, so that the volume can be approximated by the volume of the
saturated liquid,
</p>
<p>v (T, p) ≃ v (T ) ≃ vf (T ) , (6.10)
that is the volume is independent of pressure, but not of temperature. Incom-
pressibility refers to changes at constant temperature, while thermal expan-
sion or contraction are allowed. With this approximation, isothermal lines for
the compressed liquid in the p-v-diagram are vertical lines upwards from the
saturated liquid line.
</p>
<p>Internal energy seen as a function of temperature and volume can then be
reduced to its saturated liquid value as well:
</p>
<p>u (T, v) ≃ u (T, vf (T )) = uf (T ) . (6.11)</p>

<p>Fig. 6.16 Excerpt from a property table for compressed liquid water for a variety
of pressures. The temperature in brackets is the saturation temperature.
</p>
<p>For consistency, enthalpy needs to be treated differently. Due to the def-
inition h = u + pv, the above approximations give in a first step h (T, p) =
uf (T ) + pvf (T ). For the saturated liquid at the same temperature we have
hf (T ) = uf (T ) + psat (T ) vf (T ). Combining both by eliminating uf (T ), we
find the approximation for the enthalpy of compressed liquid as
</p>
<p>h (T, p) ≃ hf (T ) + (p&minus; psat (T )) vf (T ) . (6.12)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>122 6 Properties and Property Relations
</p>
<p>For small enough pressures, the correction term for enthalpy can be ignored,
so that h (T, p) ≃ hf (T ).
</p>
<p>Finally, entropy can be treated similar to internal energy,
</p>
<p>s (T, v) ≃ s (T, vf (T )) = sf (T ) . (6.13)
</p>
<p>With this approximation, isobaric lines for the compressed liquid in the T-s-
diagram lie on the saturated liquid line.
</p>
<p>As an example, we consider compressed liquid water at p = 10MPa and
T = 200 ◦C, for which the table in Fig. 6.16 gives
</p>
<p>v (T, p) = v (200 ◦C, 10MPa) = 0.001148

</p>
<p>s (T, p) = s (200 ◦C, 10MPa) = 2.3178

</p>
<p>kgK
.
</p>
<p>With the above approximations, we find the corresponding values from the
saturation table in Fig. 6.10 as
</p>
<p>v (T, p) ≃ vf (T ) = vf (200 ◦C) = 0.001157
m3

</p>
<p>u (T, v) ≃ uf (T ) = uf (200 ◦C) = 850.65

</p>
<p>h (T, p) ≃ hf (T ) = hf (200 ◦C) = 852.45

</p>
<p>h (T, p) ≃ hf (T ) + (p&minus; psat (T )) vf (T ) = 862.2

</p>
<p>s (T, v) ≃ sf (T ) = sf (200 ◦C) = 2.3309

</p>
<p>kgK
.
</p>
<p>For this particular example, the approximations yield relative errors below
1%, and even smaller at lower pressures. For higher pressures, however, the
relative errors are larger, since compressibility affects all property values,
hence these approximations should be used with care. Whenever a full table
for compressed liquid states is available, that table should be used. If a table
for the liquid states is not available, as is often the case for relatively low
pressures, the approximations are quite useful.</p>

<p>6.10 The Ideal Gas 123
</p>
<p>6.10 The Ideal Gas
</p>
<p>When the temperature of a vapor is sufficiently above the critical temperature
or when the pressure is sufficiently below the critical pressure, it will obey
the ideal gas law
</p>
<p>pv = RT , (6.14)
</p>
<p>where R = R̄/M is the gas constant. We have discussed ideal gases already
in Sec. 2.15, and used the ideal gas law and the caloric equation of state in
examples. We repeat some of the property relations and add new ones.
</p>
<p>Experiments and theoretical considerations (see Sec. 16.3) show that for
ideal gases internal energy u and enthalpy h = u + pv = u + RT depend
on temperature only. Therefore, also their derivatives, the specific heats at
constant volume, cv, and at constant pressure, cp, defined in (3.15, 3.22),
depend only on temperature,
</p>
<p>cv =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;T
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>v
</p>
<p>=
du
</p>
<p>dT
= cv (T ) , (6.15)
</p>
<p>cp =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;h
</p>
<p>&part;T
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>=
dh
</p>
<p>dT
= cp (T ) .
</p>
<p>Since h = u+RT , it follows
</p>
<p>cp = cv +R . (6.16)
</p>
<p>Integration of the specific heats gives energy and enthalpy,
</p>
<p>u (T ) =
</p>
<p>&int; T
</p>
<p>T0
</p>
<p>cv (T
&prime;) dT &prime; + u0 , (6.17)
</p>
<p>h (T ) =
</p>
<p>&int; T
</p>
<p>T0
</p>
<p>cp (T
&prime;) dT &prime; + h0 ,
</p>
<p>with reference energy u0 and, for consistency, reference enthalpy h0 = u0 +
RT0.
</p>
<p>The entropy of an ideal gas is determined from integration of the Gibbs
equation (6.2). With dh = cpdT and the ideal gas law, the Gibbs equation
assumes the form
</p>
<p>ds =
cp
T
dT &minus; v
</p>
<p>T
dp =
</p>
<p>cp
T
dT &minus; R
</p>
<p>p
dp . (6.18)
</p>
<p>The entropy for the state (T, p) follows by integration between (T, p) and
(T0, p0) as
</p>
<p>s (T, p) = s0 (T )&minus;R ln p
p0
</p>
<p>, (6.19)
</p>
<p>where we introduced the abbreviation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>124 6 Properties and Property Relations
</p>
<p>s0 (T ) =
</p>
<p>&int; T
</p>
<p>T0
</p>
<p>cp (T
&prime;)
</p>
<p>T &prime;
dT &prime; + s (T0, p0) . (6.20)
</p>
<p>The constant of integration is chosen such that s0 (T ) is the ideal gas entropy
at reference pressure p0 = 1bar. The value of the reference entropy s (T0, p0)
can be obtained from the third law, which will be discussed later (Sec. 23.6).
As long as non-reacting mixtures are considered, its value is unimportant,
since it cancels in all calculations. Indeed, only entropy differences are rele-
vant, for which we find
</p>
<p>s (T2, p2)&minus; s (T1, p1) = s0 (T2)&minus; s0 (T1)&minus;R ln
p2
p1
</p>
<p>. (6.21)
</p>
<p>When one is not interested in entropy as a function of T and p, but as a
function of T and v, the ideal gas law can be used to eliminate pressure,
</p>
<p>s (T2, v2)&minus; s (T1, v1) = s0 (T2)&minus; s0 (T1)&minus;R ln
T2v1
T1v2
</p>
<p>. (6.22)
</p>
<p>In summary, energy and enthalpy of the ideal gas depend only on temper-
ature, and its entropy depends explicitly on pressure (6.21) or volume (6.22),
and on temperature through the function s0 (T ). The temperature dependent
quantities u (T ) , h (T ) , s0 (T ) are tabulated.3
</p>
<p>As an example we consider a property table for air. The molar specific
heat of air can be approximated by the Shomate equation
</p>
<p>c̄p = a0 + a1T + a2T
2 + a3T
</p>

<p>The mass based specific heats are cp = c̄p/M and cv = cp&minus;R. Internal energy
u, enthalpy h and entropy function s0 (T ) follow from integration using the
formulas above. Figure 6.17 shows the resulting table.
</p>
<p>Tables for other gases are widely available, or can be easily produced from
the Shomate equation with the appropriate data for the coefficients, which
can be found, e.g., from NIST (http://webbook.nist.gov/).

<p>For monatomic gases, i.e., the noble gases helium (He), neon (Ne), argon
(Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn), the specific heats are true
constants with the values

<p>and the caloric equation of state follows from straightforward integration as
</p>
<p>u (T ) = cv (T &minus; T0) + u0 , (6.26)
h (T ) = cp (T &minus; T0) + h0 .
</p>
<p>With cp = const, the integration in (6.20) can be performed easily, and
the entropy becomes

<p>s (T, p) = cp ln
T
</p>
<p>T0
&minus;R ln p

monatomic gases are rather simple, these are typically not tabulated.</p>

<p>126 6 Properties and Property Relations
</p>
<p>6.12 Specific Heats and Cold Gas Approximation
</p>
<p>The value of the specific heat is related to the degrees of freedom of a
molecule. Specifically, each degree of freedom contributes 12R to the specific
heat at constant volume (equipartition of energy). The atoms of monatomic
gases are essentially spheres that can translate in three directions (up/down,
right/left, forward/backward); accordingly, the specific heat of monatomic
gases is cv = 3&times; 12R.
</p>
<p>For diatomic gases like oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), hydrogen (H2), the
molecules are shaped like dumb-bells. At low temperatures these have, in
addition to their three translational degrees of freedom, two rotational de-
grees of freedom for the rotation about two principal axes&mdash;there is no rota-
tion around the longitudinal axis. More complex molecules like carbondioxid
(CO2) and water (H2O) have three translational and three rotational degrees
of freedom. Moreover, the molecules can oscillate, the more complicated a
molecule is, the more oscillating modes are observed.
</p>
<p>At sufficiently low temperatures only translational and rotational modes
are excited. With each mode contributing 12R to the specific heat, we have
at low T for a diatomic gas cv =
</p>
<p>5
2R, cp =
</p>
<p>7
2R, and for a polyatomic gas
</p>
<p>cv = 3R, cp = 4R. Oscillatory modes obey quantum mechanical laws; they are
not excited at low temperatures and contribute in a temperature dependent
manner for higher temperatures. Figure 6.18 shows the molar specific heat
c̄p = Mcp for a variety of ideal gases. Note the temperature independent value
c̄p =
</p>
<p>5
2 R̄ = 20.8
</p>
<p>kJ
kgK for monatomic gases, and the common low temperature
</p>
<p>value of c̄p =
7
2 R̄ = 29.1
</p>
<p>kJ
kg K for diatomic gases.
</p>
<p>Air, as a mixture of roughly 78% N2, 21% O2 and 1% Ar, behaves
essentially like a diatomic gas, with the low temperature specific heats
cairv =
</p>
<p>5
2Rair, c
</p>
<p>air
p =
</p>
<p>7
2Rair . As air temperatures rises, so do the specific
</p>
<p>heats.
To simplify computations, one frequently assumes constant specific heats.
</p>
<p>To not deviate too much from the actual states, one should use suitable
average values cavgv , c
</p>
<p>avg
p for the temperature interval under consideration, or,
</p>
<p>alternatively, the values at room temperature. In the latter case one speaks
of the cold-gas-approximation, or, for air, cold-air-approximation. Internal
energy, enthalpy and entropy are
</p>
<p>u (T ) = cavgv (T &minus; T0) + u0 ,
h (T ) = cavgp (T &minus; T0) + h0 , (6.28)
</p>
<p>s (T, p) = cavgp ln
T2
T0
</p>
<p>&minus;R ln p2
p0
</p>
<p>+ s0 .
</p>
<p>The cold-gas-approximation, where one uses cavgv = cv (T0), works best for
relatively low temperatures (e.g., T &lt; 600K for air), but is highly useful
to understand the basic behavior of thermodynamic systems. Constant spe-
cific heats allow analytical calculations that give, e.g., explicit expressions for</p>

</p>
<p>efficiencies that help to further the understanding. Exact engineering calcu-
lations must use variable specific heats, of course, and tabulated data must
be used, unless the gas is monatomic and the specific heat independent of
temperature!
</p>
<p>6.13 Real Gases
</p>
<p>Gases (or vapors) at relatively high pressures or relatively low temperatures
do not obey the ideal gas law. To understand why that is the case, it is
helpful to know a little bit about the derivation of the ideal gas law with the
tools of Statistical Thermodynamics, which relies on two assumptions: (a)
Gas particles are mass points, that is their volume can be ignored. (b) There
are no long-distance forces between the particles, they only interact in short
collisions, and travel most distance between collisions in free flight.
</p>
<p>J. D. van der Waals (1837-1923) derived an equation that modifies the
ideal gas equation to address both points. The van der Waals equation reads
</p>
<p>p =
RT
</p>
<p>v &minus; b &minus;
a
</p>
<p>v2
. (6.29)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>128 6 Properties and Property Relations
</p>
<p>The constant b accounts for the volume of the particles, where v &minus; b is the
volume accessible to an individual particle. The constant a accounts for long-
range attractive forces between the particles, which reduce the pressure. The
constants a, b can be obtained from fitting to critical point data. For large
values of the specific volume v the equation reduces to the ideal gas law. A
deeper discussion of the van der Waals equation can be found in Sec. 16.8,
where it will be seen that the equation gives a good qualitative description
of real gas effects and liquid-vapor phase change. However, its quantitative
agreement with gas behavior is not so good. Therefore, the equation is mainly
used as an educational example, but not for simulation of real processes.
</p>
<p>Since explicit equations for real gas behavior are useful for simulations
and calculations, there exist a wide variety of real gas equations, which
can be found in the technical literature (Redlich-Kwong equation, Beattie-
Bridgeman equation, virial expansions, etc.).
</p>
<p>6.14 Fully Incompressible Solids and Liquids
</p>
<p>Also for solids the specific heats depend in general on temperature and volume
(or any other pair of properties), and must be collected in tables. Quite often
it is possible to treat the solids to be fully incompressible (no change of
volume, v = const), and to assume constant specific heat. Then, internal
energy, enthalpy and entropy are
</p>
<p>u (T ) = c (T &minus; T0) + u0 ,
h (T, p) = c (T &minus; T0) + v (p&minus; p0) + h0 , (6.30)
</p>
<p>s (T ) = c ln
T
</p>
<p>T0
+ s0 .
</p>
<p>As always, u0, h0 and s0 are suitable reference values. Due to incompressibil-
ity, the specific heats at constant volume and constant pressure agree, as the
following line of equations shows:

water and vapor are left in the jar. Then cooking stops, and as the jar cools,

<p>Reversible Processes in Closed
Systems
</p>
<p>7.1 Standard Processes
</p>
<p>In Chapter 8 we shall study thermodynamic cycles in closed systems which
model thermal engines, including internal combustion engines. The focus will
lie on the understanding of the working principles of the cycles, and on the
main parameters that determine their efficiency. For this it is customary to
base the analysis on reversible processes, which allow a full analysis.
</p>
<p>There are a number of processes that are often realized (at least approx-
imately) in thermodynamic systems: processes at constant volume, constant
pressure, constant temperature, or adiabatic processes. Typical thermody-
namic cycles consist of closed chains of several of these processes. In this
chapter we compute work and heat for these standard processes as a refer-
ence for the discussion of cycles.

<p>through heating and piston work only; stirring (propeller work) as an irre-
versible process is excluded. All movement of the material in the system is so
slow that velocity and kinetic energy can be ignored. For a stationary system,
potential energy is constant and can be ignored as well. Thus, at all times
the system is in homogeneous equilibrium states which are characterized by
the temperature T , the pressure p, and the volume V .
</p>
<p>We list the relevant equations from previous chapters. Under the above
simplifications, the first law for closed systems reduces to
</p>
<p>dU
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇&minus; Ẇ , (7.1)
</p>
<p>where Q̇ is the heat transfer rate, and Ẇ denotes power. Integration over the
duration of the process gives the time-integrated energy balance
</p>
<p>U2 &minus; U1 = Q12 &minus;W12 , (7.2)

</p>
<p>Ẇdt (7.3)
</p>
<p>are the total amounts of heat and work exchanged between the states 1 (at
time t1) and 2 (at time t2).
</p>
<p>For an infinitesimal step of the process (duration dt) we have the differen-
tial form of the first law
</p>
<p>dU = δQ&minus; δW , (7.4)
where δQ = Q̇dt and δẆ = Ẇdt are heat and work exchanged during dt.
The notation implies that work and heat have inexact differentials, since they
are process dependent quantities.
</p>
<p>For a reversible process in a closed system, the work is just the piston
work,

<p>Ẇ = p

<p>This was used for drawing the curve in the diagram. For an ideal gas, the
isobaric process in the T-s-diagram follows an exponential. Since cp = cv +
R &gt; cv, isobaric lines in the T-s-diagram are not as steep as isochoric lines
starting at the same point.
</p>
<p>7.5 Isentropic Process: q12 = δq = ds = 0
</p>
<p>A system that is insulated against heat transfer is adiabatic. However, adi-
abatic processes are also realized if the process is sufficiently fast, so that
there is no time to exchange heat. A pressure disturbance at the boundary,
i.e., induced by the moving piston, travels with the speed of sound, and ac-
cordingly mechanical equilibrium in the working fluid is assumed rather fast.
A temperature disturbance at the boundary, however, diffuses slowly into the
working fluid. In other words, pressure equilibration and heat transfer occur
on quite distinct time scales. Accordingly, a compression (i.e., pressure in-
crease) or expansion (i.e., pressure decrease) process may be slow enough to
allow for pressure equilibration in the system, but at the same time may be
so fast that there is no time to exchange heat between the working fluid and
the system walls, even if they have different temperatures. Such a process
can be modelled to be (approximately) adiabatic.
</p>
<p>From the relation between entropy and heat for reversible processes (7.6)
follows for an adiabatic process
</p>
<p>δq = 0 = Tds =&rArr; ds = 0 , s = const. (7.15)
</p>
<p>The reversible adiabatic process is isentropic, see Fig. 7.5 for process sketch

<p>The value of the ratio of specific heats is k = 1.667 for monatomic gases, and,

<p>Isothermal processes require exchange of heat with a large reservoir at con-
stant temperature. Since heat exchange is slow, isothermal processes must be
rather slow and therefore they are not found in the most common thermo-
dynamic cycles. Figure 7.6 shows process sketch and diagrams.

<p>7.7 Polytropic Process (Ideal Gas): pvn = const
</p>
<p>Processes in actual applications might differ from those discussed above. A
useful approximate description of a wide variety of processes in ideal gases is
offered by the polytropic process, which is a generalization of the adiabatic
relations (7.23) to arbitrary exponents n,
</p>
<p>Tp
1&minus;n
n = const. , pvn = const. , T vn&minus;1 = const. (7.27)

<p>Special choices for the polytropic exponent n refer to the previously discussed
processes as follows
</p>
<p>n = 0 &rArr; p = const isobaric
n = 1 &rArr; pv = RT = const. isothermal
n = k &rArr; pvk = const isentropic (const. cp)
n = &infin; &rArr; v = const. isochoric
</p>
<p>Often one uses values of n in the interval 1 &le; n &le; k to describe processes
that are not fully adiabatic and not fully isothermal, e.g., compression or
expansion processes with small heat exchange. Figure 7.7 shows the various
processes in the two diagrams.

<p>7.9.6 Reversible and Irreversible Adiabatic
Expansion
</p>
<p>Reversible processes require control over the process at all times. The slow
expansion of a gas in a piston-cylinder system is the prototypical example for
reversible processes.
</p>
<p>To further our understanding, we consider the adiabatic expansion&mdash;
reversible and irreversible&mdash;of air as ideal gas at initial state p1 = 10 bar,
T1 = 500K to an end state of half the pressure, so that p2 =
</p>
<p>1
2p1.
</p>
<p>For the adiabatic reversible case we can refer to the above table which tells
us that
</p>
<p>w12 = u (T1)&minus; u (T2) ,
where T2 follows from isentropicity of the process,
</p>
<p>0 = s (T2, p2)&minus; s (T1, p1) = s0 (T2)&minus; s0 (T1)&minus;R ln

<p>The table in Fig. 6.17 gives pr (T1 = 500K) = 6.202, hence pr (T2) = 3.101,
and interpolation in the table yields T2 = 412K.
</p>
<p>The tabulated relative pressure simplifies the determination of the final
state. We now show how one has to proceed when pr is not in the table: The

</p>
<p>We compare the reversible adiabatic process to the fully irreversible pro-
cess, which was discussed in Secs. 3.13, 4.13. There we saw that the temper-
ature of the ideal gas remained constant. If the initial and final pressures are
the same as for the reversible process, we compute the change of entropy as
</p>
<p>s2 &minus; s1 = s (T1, p2)&minus; s (T1, p1) = s0 (T1)&minus; s0 (T1)&minus;R ln

</p>
<p>In the irreversible process no useful work is produced and entropy is gener-
ated.

<p>It is interesting to compare this result with that obtained under the as-

which yields

gas effects. Clearly, the assumption of ideal gas behavior of steam at these
conditions is not justified.

<p>8.1 Thermodynamic Cycles
</p>
<p>In previous chapters we discussed thermal efficiency of heat engines and co-
efficient of performance of refrigerators and heat pumps from a general view-
point, without asking for the processes occurring within the engines. Now we
will discuss the working principles of several closed system cycles.
</p>
<p>All engines considered are steady state devices that do not accumulate
energy or mass over time. To realize a steady state thermodynamic engine,
a working fluid is subjected to a series of processes such that the process
curve in a property diagram forms a closed loop. As the engine operates, the
working fluid runs through the same cycle of processes again and again.
</p>
<p>The closed loop integral of the energy vanishes,
∮
</p>
<p>dE = 0, since energy is
a state property;1 the engine does not accumulate energy. Thus, integration
of the differential energy balance dE = δQ&minus; δW over the full cycle yields
</p>
<p>W⊙ =

</p>
<p>δW =

<p>∮
</p>
<p>δQ = Q⊙ = Qin &minus; |Qout| , (8.1)
</p>
<p>where W⊙ and Q⊙ are the total net work and net heat exchanged for the
cycle. Moreover, Qin &gt; 0 is the total heat transferred into the cycle, and
Qout &lt; 0 is the total heat transferred out.
</p>
<p>Net work and net heat are positive for a clockwise process&mdash;a heat engine&mdash;
and are negative for a counter-clockwise process&mdash;a refrigerator or a heat
pump.
</p>
<p>For a closed system, the engine contains the constant mass m of the work-
ing substance, and the net work and heat per unit mass are

<p>While in this chapter we discuss only reversible cycles, we note that the
processes in real engines always suffer from irreversibilities, so that their
thermal efficiencies or COP&rsquo;s will be smaller than those that will be computed
below.
</p>
<p>8.2 Carnot Cycle
</p>
<p>As a first example for the evaluation of a thermodynamic cycle we consider the
Carnot cycle. We introduced the Carnot engine as a fully reversible engine&mdash;
no internal or external irreversibilities&mdash;operating between two reservoirs of
temperatures TH , TL. The Carnot cycle is one possible realization of such an
engine. For a heat engine, it consists of the following four processes
</p>
<p>1-2 rev. isothermal compression at TL
2-3 rev. adiabatic (isentropic) compression from TL to TH
3-4 rev. isothermal expansion at TH
4-1 rev. adiabatic (isentropic) expansion from TH to TL
</p>
<p>Heat is only exchanged with the reservoirs during the isothermal processes,
at which the working substance is at the temperature of the reservoirs, and
therefore there are no external irreversibilities associated with the cycle. Since
there are no internal or external irreversibilities, the above cycle is a fully
reversible cycle that exchanges heat only with the two reservoirs.
</p>
<p>The T-s-diagram allows us to compute the thermal efficiency of the cycle:
The area enclosed by the cycle is the net work,
</p>
<p>w⊙ = q⊙ = (TH &minus; TL)∆s . (8.8)
</p>
<p>The area below the curve 3-4 is the heat in,
</p>
<p>qin = q34 = TH∆s . (8.9)</p>

</p>
<p>We now compute the efficiency by considering the cycle for an ideal gas.
With the work and heat of reversible processes computed in the last chapter,
we find the values for heat and work of the individual processes as

<p>1-2 isothermal: w12 = &minus;RTL ln p2p1 , q12 = &minus;RTL ln

</p>
<p>,

p3 ,
</p>
<p>4-1 isentropic: w41 = u (TH)&minus; u (TL) , q41 = 0 ,
</p>
<p>(8.11)
</p>
<p>Since the processes (2-3) and (4-1) are isentropic, we have

</p>
<p>. (8.12)
</p>
<p>From comparison of the two equations we find that the pressures at the corner
points of the process are related as p3p2 =
</p>
<p>p4
p1
, or, alternatively, p3p4 =
</p>
<p>p2

pressures, we find, once more, the Carnot efficiency,</p>

</p>
<p>That we found the well-known result again from detailed calculations for
an ideal gas proves that the ideal gas temperature scale (Sec. 2.13) is identical
to the thermodynamic temperature scale (Sec. 5.6).

<p>grows with the temperature difference (TH &minus; TL) and the pressure ratio p2p1 .
Thus, for large efficiency and large work output the Carnot cycle should
operate at large temperature difference TH &minus; TL and at large pressure ra-
tios p2p1 . Then, the volume ratio between smallest and largest volume,

</p>
<p>becomes large, which makes effective sealing difficult. For example, an engine
with air as working gas operating at TL = 300K, TH = 750K, and a pressure
ratio of p2p1 = 5, has the thermal efficiency ηC = 1 &minus;
</p>

<p>= 0.6, the overall

</p>
<p>= 124; it produces
</p>
<p>the net work w⊙ = 208
kJ
kg . Internal combustion engines with comparable net
</p>
<p>work operate with significantly smaller volume and pressure ratios, and thus
are more compact and lighter, and suffer less from sealing problems.
</p>
<p>Another problem for the Carnot cycle is that the isothermal heat exchange
processes (1-2, 3-4) require slow processes, so that the cycle frequency ṅ must
be low. To produce significant amounts of power Ẇ = ṅmw⊙ the engine
would have to contain a large mass m, that is it must be large. Engines that
operate on higher frequencies ṅ can be more compact.
</p>
<p>The Carnot engine operates between two reservoirs of constant tempera-
ture. If the engine is to be heated by burning of a fuel, one does not have a
constant high temperature reservoir, but a flow of hot combustion product at
flame temperature TF which is gradually cooled to TH in the heat exchange.
This implies that there will be a temperature difference between engine and
combustion gas, and thus an external irreversibility. If one uses such a hot
flow to heat the engine, one will have warm exhaust which has still work
potential. If the exhaust is expelled into the environment, the equilibration
of temperature between the warm exhaust (at TH or higher) and the environ-
ment (at TL or lower) is an external irreversibility. To eliminate, or at least

<p>reduce this loss, the exhaust must be used for preheating of the combustion
air. We shall come back to this point in Secs. 11.7 and 12.1.
</p>
<p>In principle, one could make an effort to design an engine that follows the
Carnot cycle. Obviously, due to irreversibilities, the real engine would have an
efficiency below the Carnot efficiency. Moreover, for the reasons listed above,
such an engine would be relatively large and heavy in relation to the amount
of power it could deliver. Thus, in fact, one does not try to build engines that
follow the Carnot cycle for practical applications.
</p>
<p>The Stirling cycle with an ideal gas, which will be discussed in Sec. 13.1,
is an alternative realization of a Carnot engine, but compared to the Carnot
cycle it has a significantly smaller volume ratio. Stirling engines, i.e., engines
designed to follow the Stirling cycle, are commercially available. Naturally,
these have efficiencies below the Carnot efficiency due to unavoidable internal
and external irreversibilities.
</p>
<p>8.3 Carnot Refrigeration Cycle
</p>
<p>Inversion of the Carnot cycle gives the Carnot refrigeration (or heat pump)
cycle with the following processes:
</p>
<p>1-2 rev. adiabatic (isentropic) compression from TL to TH
2-3 rev. isothermal compression at TH
3-4 rev. adiabatic (isentropic) expansion from TH to TL
4-1 rev. isothermal expansion at TL
</p>
<p>The process curves in the p-v- and T-s-diagrams are depicted in Fig. 8.3.
As before, the curve in the T-s-diagram is independent of the working fluid,
while the p-v-diagram is sketched for an ideal gas as working fluid.

<p>8.4 Internal Combustion Engines
</p>
<p>In an internal combustion engine, heat is provided to the system by burning
an air-fuel mixture inside the system. Engine operation requires the exchange
of the working fluid after one cycle is completed, to bring in new fuel and
oxygen. Accordingly, internal combustion engines exchange mass with their
surroundings. Nevertheless, during the working cycle the system is closed,
and thus internal combustion engines can be analyzed as closed systems.
</p>
<p>Internal combustion engines are the dominant power source for cars,
trucks, ships and non-electric trains. In cars one usually finds Otto engines,
while in trucks, ships and trains Diesel engines are used.
</p>
<p>Figure 8.4 shows a sketch of a single piston-cylinder assembly of an internal
combustion engine. The piston is connected through rods to the crankshaft.
The crankshaft is driven through the expansion process, which pushes the
piston down, and it provides the work for the compression processes. Most
engines have several cylinders that run through the cycle with a phase shift
to ensure even load on the crankshaft; in single cylinder engines a fly wheel
might be mounted to the crankshaft.
</p>
<p>As the crank shaft turns, the piston moves between bottom dead center
and top dead center. The volume the piston moves through is known as the
swept volume Vs, the remaining volume at top dead center is the clearance
volume Vc. Valves allow the exchange of working fluid with the surroundings.
</p>
<p>The main difference between Otto and Diesel engine is that an Otto engine
draws in air-fuel-mix while in a Diesel engine the fuel is injected into the
cylinder later in the process. The combustion process in the Otto engine is
triggered by a spark plug, while in the Diesel engine the fuel begins to burn
as soon as it is injected. Accordingly, the figure shows spark plug (for Otto
engine) and injector (for Diesel engine).
</p>
<p>We now follow through the processes in a four-stroke engine, starting at
top dead center:
</p>
<p>Stroke I: The first stroke is the intake stroke. The valves are open, and as the
piston moves towards bottom dead center air-fuel-mix (Otto) or air (Diesel)</p>

<p>enters the cylinder. Since the valves are open, the pressure in the cylinder is
nearly constant. Whence bottom dead center is reached, the valves close.
</p>
<p>Stroke II: In the second stroke the piston returns to top dead center. Since
the valves are closed, the working fluid (air-fuel-mix or air) is compressed.
The process is fast, and nearly adiabatic, pressure and temperature increase.
The compression work is provided by the crankshaft. Shortly before the piston
reaches top dead center, the combustion is triggered, either by firing the spark
plug (Otto), or by injecting fuel which begins to burn in the hot air (Diesel).
</p>
<p>Stroke III: As the fuel burns, the temperature of the working fluid is fur-
ther increased. The hot combustion gas expands in the third stroke, as the
piston returns to bottom dead center. The expansion is fast, nearly adiabatic,
pressure and temperature decrease. The expansion work is transferred to the
crankshaft.
</p>
<p>Stroke IV: For the last of the four strokes the valves open, which leads to a
sudden pressure drop. The piston returns once more to top dead center and
pushes the expanded combustion products out. This is the exhaust stroke.
</p>
<p>We summarize the processes in the four strokes in the following list:
</p>
<p>Stroke I : intake valve open
Stroke II : compression, combustion starts valve closed
Stroke III : combustion continues, expansion valve closed
Stroke IV : exhaust valve open
</p>
<p>A rough schematic p-V-diagram for all four strokes is shown in Fig. 8.5.</p>

<p>Fig. 8.5 Schematic p-V-diagram for an internal combustion engine
</p>
<p>During strokes I and IV the valves are open, and the mass in the cylinder
changes. As indicated in the p-V-diagram, in real engines there is a small
depression during intake, and a small compression during exhaust, which we
ignore. Thus, assuming that during intake and exhaust the pressure equals
the exterior pressure p0, the piston work for the two processes is WI = p0Vs
andWIV = &minus;p0Vs. The work for these two strokes just cancels,WI+WIV = 0,
and does not need to be considered further.
</p>
<p>During strokes II and III the valves are closed, and the working fluid goes
through a closed system cycle. Due to the chemical processes occurring in
the combustion processes, the full analysis of this closed cycle is difficult.
However, the ratio between the amounts of air and fuel is rather large.
Therefore, the amount of fuel can be ignored for a basic analysis, and the
working fluid can be considered as air for the complete cycle. This leads to
the following modelling assumptions:
</p>
<p>(a) The working fluid is air.
(b) The energy that is supplied through the combustion of fuel can be
</p>
<p>described as a heat transfer into the system.
(c) The exchange of the working fluid in exhaust and intake during which
</p>
<p>hot expanded combustion product is exchanged against cold precombustion
working fluid can be considered as a heat exchange with the surroundings.
</p>
<p>This air standard analysis allows to study internal combustion engines
in a simplified yet significant manner. Further simplifications will appear in
the following sections which deal with the Otto and Diesel cycles, and some
variants.</p>

<p>8.5 Otto Cycle
</p>
<p>The Otto cycle is named after Nicolaus.A. Otto (1832-1891), who build the
first working internal combustion engine. In the Otto cycle, the fuel is mixed
into the air outside the cylinder by injection, so that air-fuel mix enters
the engine. The compression and expansion processes are assumed to be
adiabatic&mdash;the processes are fast, and there is hardly time for effective heat
exchange. When the spark plug ignites the compressed air-fuel-mix, the mix-
ture explodes. The reaction is so fast, that the piston does not move much,
and for modelling we describe this as an isochoric heat transfer into the work-
ing fluid. Thus, the compression and expansion strokes of the Otto engine can
be modelled as
</p>
<p>Stroke II: 1-2 adiabatic compression
2-3 isochoric heating (air-fuel mix explodes)
</p>
<p>Stroke III: 3-4 adiabatic expansion
4-1 isochoric cooling (exchange of working fluid)
</p>
<p>The respective process curves are shown in Fig. 8.6. For further analysis we
assume reversible processes for which we find heat and work as
</p>
<p>1-2 isentropic: w12 = u1 &minus; u2 &lt; 0 , q12 = 0 ,

</p>
<p>The simplified analysis shows that the compression ratio r is the most im-
portant parameter for the evaluation of the Otto cycle. Under the cold air
assumption the thermal efficiency depends solely on the compression ratio,
and it grows with increasing compression ratio. Obviously, one will aim for
large compression ratios to have efficient engines.
</p>
<p>The compression ratio cannot be arbitrarily large. As the air-fuel-mix is
compressed, its temperature increases, T2 = T1r
</p>
<p>k&minus;1. When the temperature
of the air-fuel-mix reaches its auto-ignition temperature, it will start to re-
act before the spark plug induces the explosion at the appropriate point in
the process. Premature combustion, known as engine knocking, reduces the
power output since it leads to increased pressure during compression, and,
even more importantly, it damages the engine. To prevent knocking, the com-
pression ratio must be limited to values which guarantee that auto-ignition
cannot occur. High grade fuel, i.e., gasoline with larger octane numbers, has
a higher auto-ignition temperature, and must be used in engines with larger
compression ratios.
</p>
<p>Typical values for the compression ratio in Otto engines are between 8
and 12. These values yield efficiencies for the idealized cycle discussed above
between 0.565 and 0.63. Real engines have about 30% loss to irreversible
processes (friction, heat transfer) within the engine, and another 30% loss to
friction in the drive train, so that their actual efficiency is η = 0.7 &times; 0.7 &times;
ηOtto = 0.28 (for r = 8).

strokes (recall that inlet and exhaust work cancel), the power delivered by

</p>
<p>As an example we consider an engine operating on the ideal Otto cycle with
a compression ratio r = 9. The total swept volume of all cylinders is Vs =
3 litres, and the engine runs at ṅ = 3000 rpm. The intake is at T1 = 300K,
p1 = 0.98 bar, and the heat transfer through the combustion process is q23 =
717 kJkg . We determine temperatures, pressures and specific volume for the four
corner points of the process, and compute heat and work for all subprocesses.

<p>. Since the process 4-1 is isochoric, we have v4 = v1,
and the other two volumes follow from the compression ratio as v2 = v3 =

<p>The compression process 1-2 is isentropic, so that p2 = p1r

<p>8.7 Diesel Cycle
</p>
<p>In the Diesel cycle, named after its inventor Rudolf Diesel (1858-1913), only
air is drawn in and compressed, and the fuel is injected after the compression.
Here, one utilizes the temperature increase of the air in compression: as the
fuel is injected it starts to burn in the hot compressed air. The compression
ratios of Diesel engines can be substantially higher than those of Otto engines,
with values of up to r = 30.
</p>
<p>However, injection of the fuel is slow, and the injected fuel disperses into
droplets which are not as well mixed with the air as the gasified fuel in the
Otto engine. Therefore combustion is slower than in the Otto engine, the
piston moves as the fuel burns. This process can be modelled as an isobaric
heat transfer process, so that the Diesel cycle is modelled as follows:
</p>
<p>Stroke II: 1-2 adiabatic compression
Stroke III: 2-3 isobaric heating (slow combustion during fuel injection)
</p>
<p>3-4 adiabatic expansion
4-1 isochoric cooling (exchange of working fluid)
</p>
<p>The respective process curves are shown in Fig. 8.7, which also indicates
clearance volume, swept volume, and the injection volume Vi, which is the
volume at the end of the isobaric heating process. For further analysis we
assume reversible processes for which we find heat and work as
</p>
<p>1-2 isentropic: w12 = u1 &minus; u2 &lt; 0 , q12 = 0 ,
2-3 isobaric: w23 = p3 (v3 &minus; v2) &gt; 0 , q23 = h3 &minus; h2 &gt; 0 ,

<p>For the same compression ratio r the Diesel efficiency is below the Otto
efficiency. However, the Diesel cycle allows significantly higher compression
ratios than the Otto cycle, and that is the reason why it has a larger efficiency.
For a cycle with cut-off ratio rc = 2 and compression ratio r = 20, we find
the thermal efficiency as 0.65. Irreversible losses to friction in the engine
and drive train reduce the thermal efficiency, actual engines have efficiencies
around 37%.

</p>
<p>the maximum pressure is just a short spike. Due to this, Diesel engines must
be build more sturdily, which is the main reason why they are more expensive.
On the other hand, they are more efficient, and thus require less fuel. The
cost of gasoline and Diesel fuel, respectively, also depends on taxation, and
thus it might be more cost effective to drive a Diesel powered car in some
countries, while an Otto powered car might be more cost effective in other
countries.
</p>
<p>8.8 Example: Diesel Cycle
</p>
<p>An air standard four-stroke Diesel cycle has a clearance volume Vc = 0.5 litre,
and a compression ratio r = 16.16. Intake temperature and pressure are 17 ◦C
and 1 bar, respectively, and the temperature at the end of the expansion is
707 ◦C. The engine runs at 4400 rpm. We determine temperatures, pressures
and specific volume for the four corner points of the process, and compute
heat and work for all subprocesses. For the computation we treat the working
fluid as air with variable specific heats.
</p>
<p>We outline how the various properties are determined, and collect their
numerical values in the table below this paragraph. The values for T1, p1 and
T4 are given above. From the ideal gas law we have v1 = v4 =

<p>8.9 Dual Cycle
</p>
<p>In real engines the combustion process is neither just an instantaneous, i.e.,
isochoric, explosion as assumed above for the Otto cycle, nor is it a slow iso-
baric combustion as assumed above for the Diesel cycle. To have a somewhat
better model, one can modify the description of the fuel combustion process
as a combination of isochoric and isobaric heating. The resulting cycle is the
dual cycle:
</p>
<p>Stroke II: 1-2 adiabatic compression
2-3&rsquo; isochoric heating
</p>
<p>Stroke III: 3&rsquo;-3 isobaric heating
3-4 adiabatic expansion
4-1 isochoric cooling
</p>
<p>Figure 8.8 shows the corresponding diagrams. Depending on the choice of
parameters, one can model Otto and Diesel engines as a dual cycle. The dual
step would have a more pronounced isochoric and smaller isobaric step for
Otto engines, and a smaller isochoric but more pronounced isobaric step for
Diesel engines. Moreover, Otto engines have compression ratios below 12,
while Diesel engines have higher compression ratios.</p>

<p>8.10 Atkinson Cycle
</p>
<p>At the end of the expansion process in the Otto and Diesel cycles, the work-
ing fluid is at elevated pressure and temperature, and more work could be
extracted. One method to use this work is to drive a turbo charger, which
essentially is a compressor that is used to fill the cylinders with air-fuel mix
(Otto) or air (Diesel) at elevated pressures. With this, the mass of air in the
engine is higher than when it only draws air at environmental pressure p0.
Since the power output of the engine is proportional to mass, Ẇ = ṅ2mw⊙,
turbo charging increases the power output, or gives the same power from a
smaller engine.
</p>
<p>An alternative method to make use of the work potential is used in Atkin-
son engines. The Atkinson cycle is a modification of the Otto cycle where the
compression and expansion strokes have different lengths. Specifically, the
expansion stroke is longer than the compression stroke, so that&mdash;in the best
case&mdash;the pressure at the end of expansion is equal to the intake pressure.
The early engines build by James Atkinson (1846&ndash;1914) relied on mechan-
ical valve control. Since valves can be controlled electronically, Atkinson&rsquo;s
ideas become more prominent, and engines based on the Atkinson cycle are
routinely used in modern hybrid cars.
</p>
<p>To achieve the Atkinson cycle in an actual engine one uses clever control
of the valves. In the Otto engine the valves close at the end of the intake
stroke (Stroke I), and as the piston reverses its direction, compression starts
immediately (Stroke II). In an Atkinson engine the valve remains open during
the beginning of the second stroke, so that some of the intake is pushed back
into the intake manifold. The valve closes a bit later (at volume V1) and com-
pression commences. Thus, compression occurs only on part of Stroke II. The
valves remain closed for the full expansion (Stroke III), so that the expansion
stroke is longer than the compression stroke. At the end of expansion, the
valves open and the exhaust stroke (Stroke IV) begins. Computerized control</p>

<p>Open Systems
</p>
<p>9.1 Flows in Open Systems
</p>
<p>So far we have considered only closed systems, which do not exchange mass.
We shall now extend the discussion to systems which exchange mass with
their surroundings. Figure 9.1 shows a generic open system with two inflows
and two outflows. In the following, and in the figure, the amount of mass
exchanged per unit time, the mass transfer rate or mass flow, is denoted by
ṁ. The system also exchanges propeller and piston work, Ẇ = Ẇpropeller +
</p>
<p>Ẇpiston, and heat, Q̇ = Q̇1+Q̇2, with its surroundings, just as a closed system
does. Below, we shall add the appropriate terms to the thermodynamic laws
to account for mass transport over the system boundary.
</p>
<p>States in open systems are normally inhomogeneous. One might think of
a mass element entering the system of Fig. 9.1 on the left. As the element
of mass travels through the system, it constantly changes its state: When it
passes the heating, its temperature changes, when it passes the propeller its

<p>pressure and temperature change and so on. Thus, at each location within the
system one finds different properties. As discussed earlier, an inhomogeneous
system is in a non-equilibrium state. In an open system the non-equilibrium
is maintained through the exchange of mass, heat and work with the sur-
roundings.
</p>
<p>9.2 Conservation of Mass
</p>
<p>Mass cannot be created or destroyed, that is mass is conserved. Chemical
reactions change the composition of the material, but not its mass.1 In a
closed system, the law of mass conservation states that the total mass m
in the system does not change in time, i.e., it simply reads dmdt = 0. In an
open system, where mass enters or leaves over the system boundaries, the
conservation law for mass states that the change of mass in time is due to
inflow&mdash;which increases mass&mdash;and outflow&mdash;which decreases system mass.
In other words, the rate of change in mass is due to the net difference of mass
flows entering and leaving the system,
</p>

</p>
<p>ṁe . (9.1)
</p>
<p>Here, ṁi denotes incoming mass flows and ṁe denotes exiting mass flows, as
indicated in Fig. 9.1. By definition, the mass flow is positive, the direction of
flow is made explicit by the signs in the equation.

</p>
<p>Fig. 9.2 Mass flow through the cross section A
</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 shows an element dA of the system boundary that is crossed by
mass flowing with the local velocity V&perp;. All velocity components parallel to
the surface do not play a role in transport through the surface elements, and
it suffices to consider only the normal (i.e., perpendicular to dA) velocity
V&perp; as indicated in the figure. During the time interval dt a mass element
travels the distance ds = V&perp;dt. All mass elements that are initially in the
volume element dsdA = V&perp; dAdt will cross the surface element dA during
dt. With the local density ρ, the mass in the volume element is ρV&perp; dAdt,
which thus is the mass crossing dA during dt. Division by the time interval
dt gives the amount of mass crossing the surface element per unit time as

<p>ρV&perp; dA. The macroscopic mass flow through a finite cross section A results
from integration over all surface elements,
</p>
<p>ṁ =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>A
</p>
<p>ρV&perp; dA . (9.2)
</p>
<p>For a finite cross section one will expect spatial variations of the density
ρ and velocity V&perp; over the cross section which would have to be taken into
account in the integral. As an example Fig. 9.3 shows a typical velocity profile
in pipe flow, where the fluid sticks to the wall, so that the velocity at the wall
is zero, and the flow is fastest in the middle. However, for many engineering
applications it is not necessary to resolve the velocity profile, or the profiles
of other properties. Instead, it suffices to work with local averages, and this
will be done from now on. When the average values are inserted in (9.2), they
can be pulled out of the integral, and we find
</p>
<p>ṁ = ρV A , (9.3)
</p>
<p>where ρ and V are averages over the cross section A.

</p>

</p>
<p>9.3 Flow Work and Energy Transfer
</p>
<p>The total energy E of an open system changes due to exchange of heat and
work, and due to convective energy transport, that is energy carried in or out
by the mass crossing the system boundary. Apart from propeller and volume
change work one has also to account for flow work, which is the work required
to push mass over the system boundaries.
</p>
<p>We consider convective transfer first: The specific energy e = u+ 12V2+gz
is the local energy per unit mass. Any element of mass crossing the boundary</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>180 9 Open Systems
</p>
<p>carries this specific energy along, and thus a mass flow ṁ carries the convec-
tive energy flux
</p>
<p>Ė = ṁe = ṁ
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>u+
1
</p>
<p>2
V2 + gz
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>(9.5)
</p>
<p>over the system boundary.
Now we compute flow work. The power required to push mass over the
</p>
<p>system boundary is, as always, the force required times the velocity. The
force is the local pressure times the cross section, thus
</p>
<p>Ẇflow = &minus; (pA)V = &minus;
p
</p>
<p>ρ
ṁ . (9.6)
</p>
<p>Work is done to the system when mass is entering, then Ẇflow must be
</p>
<p>negative. The system does work to push leaving mass out, then Ẇflow must
be positive. Accordingly, flow work points opposite to mass flow, which is
ensured by the minus sign in the equation.
</p>
<p>Thus, in comparison to the energy balance for closed systems, the energy
balance for the general open system of Fig. 9.1 has additional contributions to
account for convective energy transport and flow work. In condensed notation
it reads
</p>
<p>dE
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇&minus; Ẇ +
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>in/out
</p>
<p>Ė &minus;
&sum;
</p>
<p>in/out
</p>
<p>Ẇ flow , (9.7)
</p>
<p>where the sums have to be taken over all flows crossing the system boundary.
From the above expressions we find
</p>
<p>Ė &minus; Ẇ flow = ṁ

</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>. (9.8)
</p>
<p>The enthalpy h = u+ pρ arises through the combination of convective trans-
port of internal energy and flow work.
</p>
<p>Explicitly accounting for mass flows leaving and entering the system, the
1st law&mdash;the balance of energy&mdash;for the general open system becomes
</p>
<p>dE
</p>
<p>dt
=

</p>
<p>The indices (i, e) indicate the values of the properties at the location where
the respective flows cross the system boundary, that is their average values
at the inlets and outlets, respectively. This equation states that the energy
E within the system changes due to convective inflow and outflow, as well as
due to heat transfer and work. Note that the flow energy includes the work
required to move the mass across the boundaries (flow work). Moreover, there
can be several contributions to work and heat transfer, that is Ẇ =

heat transfer (Q̇k/Tk) and entropy generation due to irreversible processes
inside the system (Ṡgen &ge; 0). If all processes within the system are reversible,
the entropy generation vanishes (Ṡgen = 0). Recall that Q̇k is the heat that

<p>9.5 Open Systems in Steady State Processes
</p>
<p>Many thermodynamic systems and cycles are composed of open system de-
vices. Since the cycles (e.g., power plants or refrigerators) run continuously,
they are mainly operating at steady state. In the following sections we shall
study the basic equations for steady open systems, and tabulate work and
heat for the most important devices.
</p>
<p>In steady state processes no changes occur over time at a given location.
Then all time derivatives vanish and mass balance (9.1), energy balance (9.9),
and entropy balance (9.10) assume the forms

<p>The interpretation of these equations is straightforward: The mass balance

ters. The energy balance (9.12) states that a change of the flow energy

</p>
<p>between outflow and inflow is effected by exchange of heat
and work. The last equation, Eq. (9.13), states that the difference of entropy
flowing in and out of the system is due to transfer of entropy caused by heat
transfer (Q̇/T ) and entropy generation inside the system (Ṡgen). Entropy is</p>

</p>
<p>Here, A is the mass transfer area and β &gt; 0 is a positive transport coefficient
that must be measured.
</p>
<p>One particular example for this law is the Hagen-Poiseuille relation
(Gotthilf Hagen, 1797-1884; Jean Poiseuille, 1797-1869) of fluid dynamics
which gives the volume flow V̇ = ṁ/ρ of a fluid with shear viscosity η through

<p>Another example for (9.30) is Darcy&rsquo;s law (Henry Darcy, 1803-1858) that
describes flow through porous media. Then A is the cross section of the
porous medium considered, and β is a coefficient of permeability.

<p>9.8 Adiabatic Compressors, Turbines and Pumps
</p>
<p>In a turbine, high pressure flow drives propeller blades that are attached to a
rotating shaft. The flow does work on the blades, the rotating shaft delivers
the work to the surroundings. As the flow does work, the pressure drops,
that is turbines are driven by pressure differences. Compressors perform the
opposite task: the shaft is driven, and the rotating blades pressurize the flow:
compressors create a pressure difference and consume work.
</p>
<p>The flow through most turbines (T ) and compressors (C), as sketched in
Fig. 9.6, is so fast that there is no time to exchange heat with the surround-
ings, and thus they are often treated as being adiabatic. Although the flows
are fast, the flow velocities are normally ignored, since the kinetic energy does
not contribute significantly to work. With these simplifications (9.15, 9.16)
reduce to
</p>

sumed to be incompressible in good approximation, so that v = const. The

</p>
<p>9.9 Heating and Cooling of a Pipe Flow
</p>
<p>In flow heat exchangers, the working fluid flows through pipes that are ex-
posed to an environment at different temperature. For a simple pipe flow with
heat exchange but no work, as depicted in Fig. 9.7, one can usually ignore
the kinetic and potential energies, thus the heat exchanged is obtained from
the first law as
</p>
<p>Q̇12 = ṁ (h2 &minus; h1) , q12 =
Q̇12
ṁ
</p>
<p>= h2 &minus; h1 . (9.37)
</p>
<p>For further insight, we consider the associated entropy generation. First
we apply the second law to the flow alone, that is the system boundary is
directly at the pipe, see left of Fig. 9.7. The appropriate form of the second
law for an element dx of the flow is the Bernoulli equation (9.21). Ignoring
kinetic and potential energy, we see that the pressure must drop along the
flow, dp = &minus; 1ṁvTδṠgen &le; 0. The pressure drop is due to friction in the flow.
In our calculations we normally ignore friction effects in heat exchangers, so
that δṠgen = 0, and thus the pipe flow in heat exchangers is assumed to be
isobaric: dp = 0, or p = const.
</p>
<p>While the flow itself is reversible, typically there is irreversibility associated
with the heat exchange to the external environment: the isobaric flow heat
exchanger is internally reversible, but externally irreversible. The schematic</p>

discussed in Secs. 9.15, 9.16.
</p>
<p>9.10 Throttling Devices
</p>
<p>Throttling devices are used to create significant pressure drops by pressing
the fluid through a small orifice or a porous plug, as depicted in Fig. 9.8, or
other narrow obstacles which induce friction losses to the flow.
</p>
<p>No work is exchanged, and the flow can be considered as adiabatic; flow
velocities are small so that kinetic energy can be ignored. Due to high friction
losses the process is irreversible, and the pressure drops, dp = &minus; 1ṁvTδṠgen &lt;
0, or p2 &minus; p1 &lt; 0. Then first and second law (9.15, 9.16) reduce to
</p>
<p>h2 &minus; h1 = 0 , s2 &minus; s1 &gt; 0 . (9.39)

<p>To better understand the relation between changes of pressure and velocity
we employ the Bernoulli equation (9.21) for reversible processes and constant
potential energy, dz = 0, which gives vdp = &minus;VdV . For a nozzle dp &lt; 0 and
thus dV &gt; 0 (acceleration in pressure gradient), while for a diffuser dV &lt; 0
and thus dp &gt; 0 (pressure increase by deceleration).

<p>In reversible adiabatic nozzles and diffusers the flow is isentropic (con-

entropy must grow (dashed lines 1-2), as illustrated in Fig. 9.9.</p>

<p>9.12 Isentropic Efficiencies
</p>
<p>Many thermodynamic processes are adiabatic, since they happen so fast that
no heat can be exchanged during the process. When the process is adiabatic
and reversible, the second law tells us that the process is isentropic as well,
since Q̇ = 0 and Ṡgen = 0. Real processes, however, will always be irreversible,
so that real adiabatic processes are accompanied by entropy generation. A
useful measure for the quality of the performance of irreversible devices is
given by efficiency measures that compare adiabatic irreversible devices to
their isentropic counterparts. In the following we discuss isentropic efficiencies
for compressors, pumps, turbines, nozzles and diffusers.
</p>
<p>Compressor: The left T-s-diagram in Fig. 9.6 shows, for an ideal gas, two
isobaric lines. An adiabatic and reversible compression of the gas between
pressures p1 and p2 follows the isentropic path 1-2s; the required compressor
work per unit mass is wC,rev = h1 &minus; h2s. A real compressor is irreversible
due to internal friction and internal heat transfer, and the compressed state
will have a larger entropy. The endpoint of the compression is point 2 with
s2 &gt; s2s = s1 and the required compressor work is wC = h1&minus;h2. Note that in
the figure the line connecting points 1 and 2 is dotted to indicate that during
compression the gas is in non-equilibrium states that cannot be marked as a
path in the T-s-diagram, only the initial and endpoints are known.

do not compress a gas, but increase the pressure in a liquid.

<p>Turbine: The expansion in an adiabatic and reversible turbine follows the

<p>9.14.1 Reversible Turbine with Kinetic Energy
</p>
<p>Steam (water vapor) at 15MPa, 500 ◦C is expanded in a steady state adi-
abatic reversible turbine to 40 kPa. The inlet diameter of the turbine is
d1 = 0.1m, the exit diameter is d2 = 1.0m, and the entry velocity is
V1 = 40 ms . We determine the properties of the end state and the power
produced. As we do this, we consider the question whether the kinetic energy
of the flow can be ignored.

ample supports our statement that in the computation of turbines and com-
pressors kinetic energy can be ignored.

specific work required. The irreversible compression process (1&minus; 2), and the

<p>throttle, which it leaves at p2 = 140 kPa. We determine the exit state of the
flow.
</p>
<p>Since the saturation pressure psat (T1) = 0.504MPa is less than the actual
pressure p1, the initial state is compressed liquid. The throttle is isenthalpic,
that is h2 = h1. With the approximation for compressed liquid, we have for
the latter

<p>h1 ≃ hf (T1) + v1 (p1 &minus; psat (T1)) ≃ hf (T1) = 71.7

<p>At 140 kPa, the enthalpy h2 = h1 = 71.7

kg lies between the enthalpies of

<p>The temperature at the exit is the saturation temperature, T2 = Tsat (p2) =

</p>
<p>From the compressed liquid approximation we find the inlet entropy as
s1 ≃ sf (T1) = 0.274 kJkgK . The entropy of the end state is

</p>
<p>The isentropic nozzle is the best possible case, since it has no losses to friction

<p>Air enters the adiabatic irreversible diffuser of an air engine with a velocity of

The process can be described as polytropic with n = 1.5. We determine the
pressure at the end of the diffuser, where the flow velocity can be ignored
(V2 ≃ 0), and the mass flow.

<p>Throughout the process the temperature is so low that constant specific

<p>9.15 Closed Heat Exchangers
</p>
<p>Closed heat exchangers serve to transfer heat between different fluids, for
instance from the hot combustion gas to evaporating water in steam power
plants, or from the condenser in the power plant to the cooling water. We
ignore friction losses in the flow, so that the flows are isobaric. Figure 9.14
shows the exchange of heat between two fluids A and B in co- and counter-
flow heat exchangers, where superscripts i and e denote incoming and exiting
flows, respectively. Since the fluids flow through different piping systems, they
might have different pressures pA, pB.
</p>
<p>The conservation laws for mass and energy give for both set-ups (adiabatic
to the outside, steady state)
</p>
<p>ṁA = const. , ṁB = const. , ṁB (hB,e &minus; hB,i) = &minus;ṁA (hA,e &minus; hA,i) .
(9.48)
</p>
<p>Due to finite temperature differences, the heat exchange will be irreversible.
The second law for externally adiabatic heat exchange reads
</p>
<p>ṁA (sA,e &minus; sA,i) + ṁB (sB,e &minus; sB,i) = Ṡgen &ge; 0 . (9.49)
</p>
<p>For a closer look, we consider the first and second law for an infinitesimal
section dx of the heat exchanger (no work, kinetic and potential energies can
be ignored), which read
</p>
<p>ṁAdhA + ṁBdhB = 0 , ṁAdsA + ṁBdsB = δṠgen (9.50)

</p>
<p>Accordingly, entropy generation and lost work depend on the local temper-
ature difference between the streams. The total entropy generation is given
by the integral over the length of the heat exchanger (HE),

<p>To see that the entropy generation is positive, we note that, under the given
simplifications, the first law for stream A reads ṁAdhA = δQ̇BA where δQ̇BA
is the heat going from B to A (heat into the system is positive). Since heat
goes from warm to cold, we have δQ̇BA &gt; 0 if TB &gt; TA .
</p>
<p>A detailed discussion of counter-flow and co-flow heat exchangers shows
that the local temperature difference between the two flows is smaller for the
counter-flow design, which therefore is thermodynamically preferable (see
Sec. 15.2).
</p>
<p>9.16 Open Heat Exchangers: Adiabatic Mixing
</p>
<p>Another interesting process that occurs quite often is heat exchange be-
tween two flows by adiabatic mixing of two (or more) streams, as depicted
in Fig. 9.15. To prevent backflow, the mixed streams should have the same
pressure, but their temperatures and/or phase states are different. For the
computation, pressure losses through the mixing chamber are normally ig-
nored, so that the outflow pressure equals the inflow pressure. Moreover,
kinetic and potential energies can be ignored since their changes are much
smaller than changes in enthalpy.

<p>That is, the mass flow and the total enthalpy flow are conserved in mixing.

<p>Basic Open System Cycles
</p>
<p>10.1 Steam Turbine: Rankine Cycle
</p>
<p>About 70-75% of the World&rsquo;s electrical energy are produced in steam cycles.
An external heat source is used to evaporate pressurized water, and then the
high pressure vapor is expanded in steam turbines. The fuel for most steam
power plants is coal, followed by nuclear power. Since the heat is supplied
externally, many other heat sources can be used, including oil, gas and heat
from solar radiation.
</p>
<p>The Rankine cycle, which we shall discuss now, has been the basic steam
cycle for power generation, it is named after William Rankine (1820-1872).
Modern steam power plants use more efficient variations of the Rankine cycle
that will be discussed in Sec. 12.2.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.1 shows a schematic of the Rankine cycle. Saturated liquid wa-
ter is pressurized in an adiabatic pump (1-2). In the steam generator, the
high pressure water is heated, evaporated and superheated (2-3). The super-
heated steam is expanded in the steam turbine (3-4), which generates work;
part of the turbine work is used to run the pump, the net work is delivered
to the generator. The turbine discharges into the condenser (4-1), in which
the steam is condensed back to the initial state. Pump and turbine may be
irreversible. Figure 10.2 shows the Rankine cycle in the diagrams with respect
to saturation lines. Work and heat for the four processes are (see Sec. 9.13)

<p>10.1 Steam Turbine: Rankine Cycle 211
</p>
<p>In early steam engines the steam was expanded in piston-cylinder devices,
not in turbines. Reciprocating piston engines have large load changes, and
are more bulky, while turbines are running at constant loads, and can deliver
the same amount of power with a significantly smaller footprint.
</p>
<p>The condenser is James Watt&rsquo;s (1736-1819)most important contribution&mdash;
of many&mdash;to the improvement of steam engines. The temperature Tc in the
condenser is prescribed through heat exchange with the environment, so that
Tc is not much above the environmental temperature T0. The condenser pres-
sure is the corresponding saturation pressure psat (Tc) which lies substantially
below the environmental pressure p0. Since the work delivered by a turbine
grows with the pressure ratio,1 a steam cycle with a condenser will have a
significantly larger work output than a cycle that discharges into the envi-
ronment. The gain of work through the condenser is illustrated in the T-s-
diagram of Fig. 10.3.

of work through the condenser.
</p>
<p>A condenser requires a significant amount of cooling which usually is pro-
vided by a cooling water cycle that employs cooling towers. Due to the dif-
ficulty of providing sufficient cooling, most steam locomotives do not have
condensers, and discharge into the environment. Therefore steam locomo-
tives have low thermal efficiencies, and must be supplied with fresh water
frequently.2 In a steam power plant with condenser the working fluid runs
continuously through the system in a closed loop, which allows the use of

<p>purified water to reduce pipe corrosion. Some of the cooling water, however,
evaporates in the open cooling towers from which warm moist air rises. As
the rising moist air cools down by heat exchange with the surrounding air,
some of the water condenses to clouds (Sec. 19.9).
</p>
<p>Would the pump be fed with saturated liquid-vapor mix, the sudden col-
lapse of vapor bubbles during the compression process (cavitation) would in-
duce shock waves that lead to material damage and, ultimately, pump failure.
Cooling into the compressed liquid region only increases the heat removal,
and has no benefit. Thus, the pump should be fed with saturated liquid.
</p>
<p>As the steam expands in the turbine, it crosses the saturation line and small
liquid droplets form. These droplets hit the fast rotating turbine blades and
cause corrosion. On the other hand, a smaller quality x4 reduces the amount
of heat rejected in the condenser, and thus improves thermal efficiency. To
obtain a good balance between efficiency and prevention of corrosion, one
aims at having the quality at the turbine exit at x4 = 0.9 or higher.
</p>
<p>The pipes of the steam generator are normally made from standard steel.
At the high pressures that occur in the cycle, the temperature for the pipes
should not exceed &sim; 560 ◦C.
</p>
<p>Increase of the pressure in the steam generator improves efficiency since the
average temperature for heat supply increases. However, when the pressure
becomes large, and the turbine inlet temperature is capped at Tmax, the
expansion into the condenser leads to low qualities, and thus damage of the
turbine blades due to droplet formation. This is illustrated in Fig. 10.4, where
the standard Rankine cycle has the corner points 1-2-3-4&rsquo;. To shift the point
4&rsquo; towards values of higher quality requires either a turbine inlet temperature
T3 above the maximum temperature Tmax for the steam generator, or lower
pressure p3. Another alternative, as illustrated in the figure, is to expand the
steam in a first turbine to the intermediate pressure p5, reheat back to Tmax,
and then expand in a low pressure turbine to the condenser pressure pc. Net
work, heat in and thermal efficiency for the reheat cycle are

</p>
<p>Thus, the irreversibilities in pump and turbine reduce the cycle efficiency by

</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216 10 Basic Open System Cycles
</p>
<p>Less than one percent of the turbine work is required for the pump. To
understand the low back-work-ratio we recall that for a reversible adiabatic
process the work for both, pump and turbine, is given by w = &minus;
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>vdp. The
overall pressure difference for both devices are the same, but the volumes for
both processes differ considerably: The pump is fed with liquid water, while
the turbine is fed with vapor which has a substantially larger volume than
the liquid.
</p>
<p>10.3 Vapor Refrigeration/Heat Pump Cycle
</p>
<p>The vapor refrigeration cycle is based on the inversion of the Rankine cycle.
However, as we have seen in the last example, the back-work-ratio for the
Rankine cycle is very small, that is only a small portion of the turbine work
is required for the pump. In the inversion of the cycle the turbine becomes a
compressor which consumes power. Due to the small back-work-ratio, only a
very small portion of the compressor work could be regained in the inverse
pump, and thus one uses a throttling valve instead.
</p>
<p>We consider a refrigerator or heat pump, exchanging heat with a cold and
a warm external environment at temperatures TL, TH , respectively (recall
Sec. 5.4). Heat pump and refrigerator follow the same cycle, but they differ
in the external temperatures, and in the temperatures and pressures that
occur in the process.
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.5 Schematic and T-s-diagram for a standard vapor refrigeration cycle
exchaning heat with environments at TL, TH
</p>
<p>The standard vapor compression cycle operates as shown in the schematic
and the T-s-diagram of Fig. 10.5: Saturated or superheated vapor at low
temperature (state 1) is adiabatically compressed to higher pressure (state
2). The compressed vapor is cooled and condensed (state 3) in the condenser
which exchanges heat with the high temperature environment. The liquid at</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3 Vapor Refrigeration/Heat Pump Cycle 217
</p>
<p>state 3, either saturated or compressed, is then expanded in the throttling
device to the lower pressure (state 4). In the throttling process some of the
liquid evaporates, and the temperature drops. The low temperature saturated
mixture at state 4 receives heat from the low temperature environment and
evaporates to the compressor inlet condition (state 1).
</p>
<p>Work and heat for the four processes are
</p>
<p>1-2 adiabatic compressor: w12 = h1 &minus; h2 &lt; 0 , q12 = 0 ,
2-3 isobaric cooling: w23 = 0 , q23 = h3 &minus; h2 ,
3-4 adiabatic throttle: w34 = 0 , q34 = 0 ,
4-1 isobaric heating: w41 = 0 , q41 = h1 &minus; h4 .
</p>
<p>(10.7)
</p>
<p>The expense for refrigerator and heat pump is the work required to drive the
compressor. The gain for the refrigerator is the heat taken in from the cold
environment (qin = q41), and the gain for the heat pump is the heat rejected
into the warm environment (qout = q23). Thus, depending on whether we
consider a refrigeration device or a heat pump we find the coefficients of
performance, as gain/expense,

cycle follow after multiplication with the mass flow ṁ as
</p>
<p>Ẇ = ṁw⊙ , Q̇in = ṁq41 , Q̇out = ṁq23 . (10.10)
</p>
<p>Working fluids employed for vapor compression cycles must have good
temperature-pressure characteristics. For the low temperatures reached, the
pressures should be relatively high, and the specific volumes small, so that
the pipes and the compressors must not be too voluminous. The critical
point should be high, so that the process runs through the 2-phase region.
Moreover, the operating temperatures must lie above the triple point, so that
solid formation (freezing) will not occur. The heat of evaporation should be
large. Finally, at least for household applications, one will prefer a non-toxic
and non-flammable working fluid.
</p>
<p>Water, obviously, is not suitable, due to extremely low vapor pressures
at low temperatures, and the relatively high triple point temperature Ttr =
0.01 ◦C. Chlorofluorocarbons (e.g., refrigerant R12, CCl2F2) are now phased
out since they destroy the ozone layer, and are presently replaced by fluoro-
carbons (no chlorine) like R134a (CF3CH2F). Efficient alternatives are am-
monia (NH3) which is poisonous, and propane (C3H8) and methane (CH4)
which are flammable.</p>

compressor draws saturated vapor, and the throttle draws saturated liquid.

<p>The cycle 1-2-3-4 operates without temperature difference between the cold
environment and the evaporator. For the heat transfer between condenser
and warm environment (2-3), there is a finite temperature difference for the
cooling before the saturation temperature is reached, but the condensation
occurs with infinitesimal temperature difference. Moreover, the compressor
is reversible.

lead to a significant reduction of the performance characteristics of a cycle in

<p>The realistic cooling cycle 1&prime;-2&prime;&prime;-3&prime;-4&prime; has a COP that is not much more
than 1/3 of the Carnot cycle. Advanced cooling cycles use process modifica-

</p>
<p>We see that each of the four sources of irreversibility&mdash;two internal, and two
external&mdash;contributes about one quarter of the total work loss of Ẇloss,R =
2.337 kW. This result clearly shows that for a proper thermodynamic assess-
ment of a system one must consider both, internal and external irreversibili-
ties. Note that the work loss is the difference between the actual system work
and the work of the Carnot refrigerator (apart from round-off errors).

<p>10.5 Gas Turbine: Brayton Cycle
</p>
<p>The Brayton cycle (George Brayton, 1830-1892) is an internal combustion
cycle based on a gas turbine. Schematic and T-s-diagram are depicted in
Fig. 10.7. Environmental air at p1 = p0, T1 = T0 enters the compressor
in which it is adiabatically compressed to the pressure p2. As the air flows
through the combustion chamber, fuel is injected and burnt with some of the
air&rsquo;s oxygen which leads to heating of the air. The pressurized hot combustion
product expands in the turbine and delivers work; some of the work is required
to drive the compressor. The expanded combustion product exhausts to the
environment.
</p>
<p>5 Also for a heat pump the work loss is entropy generation times the temperature
of the environment, only that the latter is at TL, so that Ẇloss,HP = TLṠgen;
re-read Secs. 5.4, 5.10 for details.</p>

the equilibration of the exhaust to envrionmental temperature.
</p>
<p>As for the reciprocating internal combustion engines, we shall ignore the
addition of fuel, and the change of composition through the chemical reac-
tion, and treat the working fluid as air. Then, the combustion is described
as an isobaric heating process. The turbine exhaust is warmer than the en-
vironment, and exchanges heat with the environment at T0. The discharge
of hot air (state 4) and the intake of cool air (state 1) can be described as
an isobaric cooling process at p1 = p4 = p0; this process is indicated in the
schematic as dotted line.
</p>
<p>The Brayton cycle is the equivalent to the Rankine cycle for the ideal gas,
and the basic analysis is similar. The main differences are that the Brayton
cycle operates without phase change, has no cooler or condenser, and that
its back-work-ratio is much larger than that of the Rankine cycle.
</p>
<p>Work and heat for the four processes are
</p>
<p>1-2 adiabatic compressor: w12 = h1 &minus; h2 , q12 = 0 ,
2-3 isobaric heating: w23 = 0 , q23 = h3 &minus; h2 ,
3-4 adiabatic turbine: w34 = h3 &minus; h4 , q34 = 0 ,
4-1 isobaric cooling: w41 = 0 , q41 = h1 &minus; h4 .

</p>
<p>and the heat supply is

<p>The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine increases with the pressure ratio
P = p2/p1.
</p>
<p>We proceed by studying operating conditions of gas turbine systems. Obvi-
ously, the inlet pressure and temperature, p1 and T1, are set by the environmen-
tal conditions, p0 and T0. The highest temperature in the cycle is the turbine
inlet temperature T3 which is limited by the materials used for the turbine. For
fixed values of T1 and T3, the work per unit mass of air for the gas turbine is

<p>Figure 10.8 shows Brayton cycles in the T-s-diagram. All cycles share the
intake pressure p1 and the maximum temperature Tmax, but their upper
pressures (pa, pb, . . .) differ. The specific work is the area enclosed by the cycle
in the T-s-diagram, and the figure shows that the cycle with the largest upper
pressure (ph), which has the largest efficiency, has a low work output. Also
the cycle with the smallest pressure (pa), which has the smallest efficiency,
has low work output, while a cycle with intermediate pressure (pd) has the
largest work output.
</p>
<p>The goal is to produce a certain amount of power Ẇ = ṁw⊙. A gas turbine
with small specific work but large efficiency must have a larger mass flow than
a turbine with larger specific work. Larger mass flow can only be achieved by
building a bigger system, or several smaller systems, which adds capital and
maintenance costs. Normally, one will chose to operate a gas turbine close</p>

<p>For simple gas turbine systems, the hot exhaust is just expelled into the

<p>Figure 10.8 shows that the turbine exit temperature T4 decreases with in-

with increasing pressure ratio, and hence explains why the cycle efficiency
increases.
</p>
<p>As can be seen from the T-s-diagrams in Figs. 10.7, 10.8, the exhaust
temperature T4 lies above the environmental temperature T1, and may also
lie above the pre-combustion temperature T2. In advanced gas turbine cycles,
the hot exhaust is used to preheat the compressed gas before combustion
(regenerative Brayton cycle, Sec. 13.4), or as heat source for a steam power
plant (combined cycle, Sec. 13.6). With this, the hot exhaust is used, and the
external loss is reduced.

<p>10.7 Gas Refrigeration System: Inverse Brayton Cycle
</p>
<p>The inversion of the Brayton cycle results in a gas cooling system as depicted
in Fig. 10.9. Gas is compressed adiabatically (1-2), and then cooled by heat
exchange with the warm environment (2-3). The cooled gas is expanded adi-
abatically in a turbine, and assumes a low temperature (3-4). Finally, the gas
is heated by drawing heat from the cold environment (4-1). As always, we
consider a cooling system exchanging heat with reservoirs at TL, TH . Then,
to have heat transfer in the proper direction, the compressor inlet temper-
ature T1 must not be above TL, and the turbine inlet temperature T3 must
not be smaller than TH . These temperature requirements are shown in the
T-s-diagram in Fig. 10.9.

<p>Larger pressure ratios give smaller COP, but increase the cooling power. In
particular for large pressure ratios there are large external irreversibilities
associated with the heat transfer over finite temperature differences between
the cooling fluid and the two environments (see T-s-diagram in Fig. 10.9).
Nevertheless, gas refrigeration cycles offer a relatively simple means to achieve
low temperatures (&sim; 130K). Advanced gas cooling systems use internal heat
exchange (regeneration) to increase the COP.</p>

<p>Efficiencies and Irreversible Losses
</p>
<p>11.1 Irreversibility and Work Loss
</p>
<p>In the discussion of work losses for closed and open systems we found that
irreversibilities reduce the efficiency of energy conversion, see Sec. 5.10. We
shall study this now in greater detail. The arguments used in this section are
similar to &ldquo;exergy accounting&rdquo; (see Sec. 11.8 further below).
</p>
<p>We consider a general thermodynamic system as in Fig. 9.1 which is de-
scribed through the balance laws for mass, energy, and entropy (9.1, 9.9,
9.10). Part of the heat exchange between the system and its surroundings
will take place at a temperature T0, and we write

<p>The highlighted temperature T0 can be freely chosen according to the de-
tails of the actual system considered. Since most thermodynamic systems
interact with the environment, one most often chooses T0 to be the tem-
perature of the environment, usually T0 = 298K for the standard reference

no cost is associated with heat drawn from, or dumped into, the environment.
</p>
<p>Elimination of the heat exchange with the environment, Q̇0, between the
first and second laws (11.2, 11.3) yields an equation for power,

</p>
<p>This equation is the generalization of (5.17) in Sec. 5.10 to include open
system boundaries. The equation is valid for any system, open or closed,
transient or steady state, that exchanges heat at least at T0, and possibly at
other temperatures.
</p>
<p>Note, that for Q̇ = Q̇0 = 0 there is nothing to be eliminated between the
two equations, so that (11.4) is not relevant for fully adiabatic processes.
</p>
<p>The factor T0 relates power loss to entropy generation; the lost power is
sometimes denoted as irreversibility,
</p>
<p>Ẇloss = T0Ṡgen . (11.5)
</p>
<p>Equation (11.4) allows to relate irreversibility as measured by entropy
generation Ṡgen to power losses for complete thermodynamic systems, such
as power and refrigeration cycles, in contact with the environment. Since
Ṡgen &ge; 0 and1 T0 &gt; 0, this equation shows that irreversibilities reduce work
output for a power producing system (where Ẇ &gt; 0, e.g., a power plant) or
increase work demand for a power consuming system (where Ẇ &lt; 0, e.g., a
heat pump or a refrigerator).
</p>
<p>The task of a thermal engineer can be described as to improve efficiency of
a thermal system as much as possible. This requires to identify and reduce&mdash;
as much as possible&mdash;causes of losses, i.e., irreversibilities. This will lead to a
redesign of the system, which in turn leads to a change of the inflow, outflow
and boundary conditions of the system.
</p>
<p>A proper understanding of the losses associated with a system requires
that all sources for irreversibility are considered. For a proper accounting of
losses, the system boundary should be wide enough to include all causes for
loss, so that internal and external irreversibilities are accounted for.
</p>
<p>The redesign should start with removing the main causes for losses. If we
indicate the different causes for entropy generation by Greek indices, we can
write
</p>
<p>Ẇloss =
&sum;
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Reversible Work and Second Law Efficiency 237
</p>
<p>The importance of the various entropy generating processes can be evaluated
by a relative measure, e.g., the ratio between lost power and the total power
exchange for the process
</p>
<p>χα =
T0Ṡ
</p>

<p>∣
</p>
<p>. (11.7)
</p>
<p>One will not be able to avoid losses altogether, and thus will have to ac-
cept values of a few percent (or more) for χα. Nevertheless, any reduction
in irreversibilities that can be attained at reasonable cost for redesign and
construction will lead to increased power production or decreased power con-
sumption, and thus offer substantial savings in the long run of operation.
</p>
<p>11.2 Reversible Work and Second Law Efficiency
</p>
<p>A sometimes useful measure2 for the performance of a system is the second
law efficiency ηII, which compares the actual performance to the reversible
work, i.e., the best case scenario for the same process parameters.
</p>
<p>The reversible work Ẇrev is the power that would be obtained from a re-
versible process operating under the same boundary conditions as the system
considered, and exchanging heat with the environment at T0. Its value follows
from (11.4) simply by setting the irreversibility to zero, T0Ṡgen = 0,
</p>
<p>Ẇrev =
&sum;
</p>
<p>k=1
</p>

</p>
<p>1&minus; T0

</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>&minus; dE &minus; T0S
dt
</p>
<p>. (11.8)
</p>
<p>Since all irreversibilities reduce the process performance, for a work generat-
ing process the reversible work is the maximum work that could be obtained,
and for a work consuming process it is the minimum work required. The
actual work can be expressed as the difference between reversible work and
work loss, Ẇ = Ẇrev &minus; Ẇloss.
</p>
<p>The second law efficiency is defined as the ratio between the actual work
of the process and the reversible work. For a power producing system one
defines
</p>

<p>The simplest examples are given by steady state engines operating be-

refrigerator, and heat pump, as depicted in Fig. 11.1. Note that all engines
exchange heat with the environment at T0, while the temperatures of the
other reservoirs are different. The fully reversible engines operating between
two reservoirs are Carnot engines.

<p>To summarize, we state that the second law efficiency gives a qualitative
measure for the overall quality of a process by comparing actual performance
to that of a fictional reversible system with the same parameters..
</p>
<p>11.3 Example: Carnot Engine with External
Irreversibility
</p>
<p>Fully reversible (e.g., Carnot) engines cannot be build since any real process is
associated with some irreversibilities. These can be reduced, but not avoided.
For instance, heat transfer requires finite temperature differences, which are
accompanied by entropy generation, i.e., work loss. As an example we study
a reversible Carnot heat engine with external irreversibilities that occur in
transferring heat in and out of the engine, see Fig. 11.2.
</p>
<p>We compare a fully reversible engine (I), which does not require tem-
perature differences for heat transfer, and an engine (II) that requires finite
temperature differences. When both engines take in the same amount of heat,
their power outputs are</p>

<p>This simple example shows once more the importance of considering ex-
ternal losses. In order to obtain a comprehensive picture of thermodynamic
performance, one cannot restrict the attention to the performance of an</p>

</p>
<p>isolated system, say a heat engine, but one has to account for the interaction
of the system with its surroundings as well.
</p>
<p>A perfect heat exchanger, which operates at infinitesimal temperature dif-
ference, and hence does not generate entropy, requires an infinite exchange
surface, and thus can only be thought of, but not be build. Thus, in any
existing heat exchanger the temperature difference is finite, and entropy is
generated. The art of building heat exchangers, or choosing heat exchangers
for a particular system, is to make the temperature difference, and thus the
work losses, as small as technology and purchase or construction costs allow.
</p>
<p>11.4 Example: Space Heating
</p>
<p>Another instructive example is given by the heating of a house with a device
powered by electricity, e.g., a resistance heater or a heat pump. The house
sits in an external environment at temperature T0, and its temperature is
maintained at Thouse &gt; T0. Due to the temperature difference between the
warm house and the cooler environment there is a heat loss Q̇loss to the
environment. The heating system must provide the same amount of heat to
compensate for the loss, so that the inside temperature remains at Thouse.
</p>
<p>We first examine the case where the heat is provided by a heat pump
which draws the power Ẇ from the electrical grid, draws heat Q̇L from the
environment, and provides the heat Q̇H = Q̇loss at a temperature TH &gt;
Thouse; the temperature difference ensures heat transfer from the heat pump
to the house. Figure 11.3 shows the energy flows and the temperature levels
for this process.

<p>242 11 Efficiencies and Irreversible Losses
</p>
<p>There are two sources of entropy generation, that is, ultimately, work loss:
the heat pump itself, and the heat transfer from the house to the environment.
The latter is given, from (11.4), as
</p>
<p>Ṡloss =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>T0
&minus; 1
</p>
<p>Thouse

<p>)

</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣
Q̇loss
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣
.
</p>
<p>This loss is independent of the method used for heating, and can be reduced
by reducing the heat loss Q̇loss, or the inside temperature Thouse. By Newton&rsquo;s
law of cooling the heat loss is given by
</p>
<p>Q̇loss = αA (Thouse &minus; T0) ,
</p>
<p>where A is the outer surface of the house, and α is an overall heat transfer
coefficient. The heat loss can be reduced by better insulation of the exterior
walls and the roof, which gives smaller value for α, but also by reduction of
the inside temperature Thouse. For a house exposed to an environment at 0
</p>
<p>◦C,
the heating cost can be reduced by 10% when the setting of the thermostat
is reduced from 22 ◦C to 20 ◦C.
</p>
<p>Next we consider losses associated with the heat pump. To ensure heat
transfer from the environment and into the house, the heat pump operates
between temperatures TL &lt; T0 and TH &gt; Thouse. The first law relates power
and heat transfer rates as

is cheap, e.g., in Norway and British Columbia where hydropower is the main
source for generation.</p>

<p>244 11 Efficiencies and Irreversible Losses
</p>
<p>11.5 Example: Entropy Generation in Heat Transfer
</p>
<p>Heat exchange over finite temperatures is irreversible, the associated entropy
generation is related to a work loss. The reason for the work loss is that
any temperature difference could be used to drive a heat engine. In heat
exchange, there is no engine, hence the loss. As we have seen, energy at
higher temperature is more valuable, since more work can be extracted (larger
Carnot efficiency). Heat transfer over finite temperature difference conserves
the amount of energy transferred (heat), but after transfer the energy is at
lower temperature, where the energy is less valuable, since less work can be
extracted. We now discuss why the lost work for a system in contact with
the environment is T0Ṡgen (11.5).
</p>
<p>We consider heat transfer Q̇ between reservoirs at TH and TL. The asso-
ciated entropy generation is

</p>
<p>Note that the Carnot engine involves heat exchange, which must be done
by perfect heat exchangers operating at infinitesimal temperature difference,
which is impossible in practice.
</p>
<p>We recall that the computation of work loss and reversible work relies
on the assumption that all boundary parameters remain unchanged. The

</p>
<p>In both cases, the second engine is exchanging heat with the environment
at T0. It should be noted that fully reversible engines are not available, so that
the discussed systems are only of theoretical interest. Nevertheless, wherever
heat transfer over finite temperature differences occurs, there is the poten-
tial to do work. Whether it is feasible to do this depends on the individual
circumstances of the heat transfer process, in particular on the temperature
difference. The larger the temperature difference, the larger is the entropy
generation, and the bigger is the work potential.
</p>
<p>11.6 Work Potential of a Flow (Exhaust Losses)
</p>
<p>Many engines, in particular combustion engines, discard warm or hot exhaust.
We ask how much work could be extracted by bringing the exhaust into
equilibrium with the environment by reversible processes. For this we consider
Fig. 11.4, which shows a system to extract work from an available mass flow
ṁ at T1, p1, V1. The figure indicates that we can obtain work from propellers
inside the flow and by heat transfer through reversible engines which discard

The first term on the right, &minus;T0Ṡgen, describes irreversible losses anywhere
in the system, the second term is the reversible flow work extracted from the
propellers inside the flow, and the third term is the reversible work available
from the external heat engines. Indeed, with ṁTds = δQ̇ the last term can

engines on an infinitesimal step of the flow. Thus, if the entropy generation
vanishes, the heat engines are a series of infinitesimal Carnot engines.
</p>
<p>The maximum work is extracted when all processes are reversible, so that
Ṡgen = 0, and when no external irreversibilities occur, which requires that
the exhaust is in equilibrium with the environment, i.e.,3 T2 = T0, p2 = p0,
V2 = V0 = 0. Then,

<p>Here we have defined the flow exergy (or availability) ψ as the maximum
work per unit mass that can be extracted from a flow by equilibrating it with

</p>
<p>The exhaust of a turbine or nozzle has work potential as measured by
its exergy. If this work potential is not used, exergy is destroyed and en-
tropy produced. For the case of a single outflow into the environment, the
corresponding entropy generation is

<p>3 The environment is at rest and work could be extracted from any flow faster
than the environment. Thus, for no external irreversibilities to occur, one must
set V2 = 0. However, then one could not remove the exhaust&mdash;for real applications
one will assume V2 ≪ V1.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.7 Heat Engine Driven by Hot Combustion Gas 247
</p>
<p>compare the result to that of a case where a single reversible Carnot engine
is employed to convert combustion heat into power.
</p>
<p>Fuel must be mixed with air and, after its work is done, the combustion
product must be removed. Thus, for combustion processes one does not have
a single hot reservoir, but the heat is taken from a stream that is gradually
cooled as heat is withdrawn.
</p>
<p>To simplify the discussion, we ignore the amount of fuel mass added, and
treat the combustion product as air; we shall also simplify for constant specific
heats to obtain explicit formulae for work and efficiencies. Pressure losses
are ignored, and the combustion is assumed to take place at environmental
pressure p0.
</p>
<p>First we consider the isobaric combustor: fuel and air enter the combustor
at environmental temperature T0, and the hot combustion gas leaves at the
flame temperature TF . Since we ignore the mass flow of fuel, the heat added
to the air is
</p>
<p>Q̇fuel = ṁ [h (TF )&minus; h (T0)] = ṁcp (TF &minus; T0) , (11.20)
</p>
<p>where the flame temperature TF depends on the amount of fuel added. The
amount of heat supplied by combustion of the fuel is the product of the
mass flow of fuel and the fuel&rsquo;s heating value qHV (measured in kJ/ kg fuel),
Q̇fuel = ṁfuelqHV. Thus, the cost associated with the process is proportional
to Q̇fuel.
</p>
<p>Q̇fuel is also the maximum heat available to convert into power in a heat
engine. If Q̇fuel is completely consumed by the heat engine, the exhaust of
the power plant is at T0. The maximum amount of work that can be obtained
from the hot combustion gas4 follows from (11.18), after ignoring kinetic and
potential energies, as
</p>
<p>Ẇrev = ṁ [h (TF )&minus; h (T0)&minus; T0 (s (TF , p0)&minus; s (T0, p0))]
</p>
<p>= ṁcp

<p>Q̇fuel

</p>
<p>ln TFT0

</p>
<p>&minus; 1
. (11.22)
</p>
<p>This thermal efficiency for power extraction from a hot gas flow, valid only
for constant specific heat, is the equivalent to the Carnot efficiency, which
describes processes between reservoirs at constant temperatures.
</p>
<p>4 This is also the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from the fuel in a
combustion process, but, since combustion is irreversible, it is not the maximum
amount of work available from the fuel&mdash;this will be discussed later, when reacting
mixtures are discussed.</p>

<p>Fig. 11.5 Carnot engine heated by continuous stream of combustion gas
</p>
<p>Now we compare this hypothetical best case to the case where the heat
extracted from the flow is transferred into a single Carnot engine operat-
ing between the temperatures T0 and TH . The engine is heated by the hot
combustion gas that enters its heat exchanger at flame temperature TF and
leaves at TH . For now we assume that the exhaust at TH is not further
utilized, but dumped into the environment. The Carnot engine is internally
reversible, but obviously there are external irreversibilities associated with
the heat transfer into the engine, and with heat transfer between the exhaust
gas and the environment. Figure 11.5 shows the corresponding system, in-
cluding the air temperatures before and after combustion, and before and
after heat exchange with the Carnot engine. The heat withdrawn from the
combustion gas and added to the Carnot engine is
</p>
<p>Q̇in = ṁ [h (TF )&minus; h (TH)] . (11.23)
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the work produced by the&mdash;reversible&mdash;Carnot engine is
</p>
<p>ẆC =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1&minus; T0
TH
</p>

<p>)
</p>
<p>(TF &minus; TH) . (11.24)
</p>
<p>The temperature TH at the hot side of the engine is a variable of the
process. A larger value of TH increases the thermal efficiency of the Carnot
engine, but also leads to a larger exergy of the exiting flow, and thus to a larger
external loss. Small values of TH lead to small thermal efficiency, and to large
temperature difference between engine and hot gas flow, which implies large
entropy generation and work loss in heat transfer. Closer examination shows
that for a given flame temperature TF and the combustion flow ṁ, the power
produced by the Carnot engine, ẆC , has a maximum at TH,max =
</p>
<p>&radic;
T0TF ,
</p>

<p>)2
</p>
<p>. (11.25)
</p>
<p>Next we consider the efficiency of this conversion process. There are several
efficiency measures that can be defined. The thermal efficiency of the Carnot
engine alone is based on the heat intake of the engine,
</p>
<p>ηC,max =
ẆC,max
</p>
<p>Q̇in

</p>
<p>TH,max
= 1&minus;
</p>
<p>&radic;
</p>
<p>T0
TF
</p>
<p>. (11.26)
</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is just the thermal efficiency (10.21) of the ideal Brayton
cycle at maximum work. However, this efficiency is not a good measure for
the system performance, since it ignores that more heat is available from
the exhaust gas at TH , which is not further used, and, according to the
assumptions made, dumped into the environment.
</p>
<p>Since the total heat available from cooling the hot flow to environmental
temperature is5 Q̇fuel = ṁcp (TF &minus; T0), the proper efficiency measure for the
conversion of combustion heat into power in this set-up is
</p>
<p>ηcomb =
ẆC,max

<p>Figure 11.6 shows the efficiencies ηmax, ηC,max and ηcomb for temperatures TF
between T0 = 298K and 1500K. We compute the efficiencies for TF = 1500K
as ηmax = 0.599, ηC,max = 0.554, and ηcomb = 0.383 (TH = 668K for the
Carnot engine).

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>250 11 Efficiencies and Irreversible Losses
</p>
<p>The efficiency ηmax describes the best possible, i.e., fully reversible, system
to produce work from the combustion gas. This efficiency can be used to define
the second law efficiency for other processes as ηII = ηηmax
</p>
<p>. For the data given
</p>
<p>above, we find the second law efficiencies ηIIC,max = 0.925, and η
II
comb = 0.639.
</p>
<p>The fully reversible system has the highest efficiency, ηmax. The single
Carnot engine looses work to irreversibilities in heat transfer between hot
gas and engine, and in the dumping of hot exhaust into the environment;
accordingly it has a significantly lower efficiency ηcomb. The efficiency ηC,max
considers only the actual heat entering the engine, Q̇in, not the total heat
produced in combustion, Q̇F . This efficiency is higher than ηcomb since it
ignores the energy lost with the hot exhaust at TH .
</p>
<p>It is particularly important to note that the efficiency ηC,max, which ignores
the exhaust losses, leads to a far better impression of the quality of the process
than the use of the efficiency ηcomb which includes the exhaust losses. The
important lesson to be learned here, is that one has to be rather careful about
efficiency values presented anywhere, since one can always find an efficiency
measure that lets a process appear to be better than it actually is, simply by
excluding some, or all, external irreversibilities associated with the process.
</p>
<p>The discussed process invites the question what one could do to utilize
the exhaust at TH . For an answer, we recognize that the fuel is needed to
heat the air before it exchanges heat with the heat engine. Fuel consumption
can be reduced by using the exhaust air (at TH) to preheat the incoming air
before combustion. The heat exchanger used for this is called a regenerator,
and Fig. 11.7 shows the system with the regenerator added. When we assume
perfect heat exchange between the incoming and the exiting air streams (both

air cools down to T0. In this case, only the heat

</p>
<p>must be provided from the combustion of fuel. As indicated, this is just the
heat going into the heat engine, Q̇in, so that now all heat from the fuel is
used in the engine. The exhaust is in equilibrium with the environment, and
hence there is no external entropy generation&mdash;and no external loss. The
only irreversibility in the considered process is the heat transfer between the
hot gas and the engine. The efficiency for the engine with regenerator, and
optimal choice for TH , is

<p>Regeneration will be discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters, includ-
ing the consideration of imperfect heat exchange.
</p>
<p>11.8 Exergy
</p>
<p>Exergy, also known as &ldquo;availability&rdquo;, is defined as the maximum amount of
work that can be extracted from a flow or an amount of substance by only
exchanging heat with the environment until equilibrium with the environment
is reached.
</p>
<p>Thus, exergy describes work potential, and can be a useful concept to an-
swer questions like whether it is worthwhile to harvest energy from a system.
As an example one might think of the exhaust of fuel fired power plants as
discussed in Section 11.6.
</p>
<p>Exergy analysis is now an accepted method within the field of thermody-
namics. We shall introduce the concept in this section, but since we prefer
to focus on entropy generation and lost work arguments, we shall use exergy
only occasionally.
</p>
<p>To compute exergy, the combined first and second law (11.4) is simplified
for the case where heat is exchanged only with the environment at T0 and all
</p>
<p>processes are reversible, that is by setting
&sum;
</p>
<p>k 
=0
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>1&minus; T0Tk
)
</p>
<p>Q̇k &minus; T0Ṡgen = 0 .
We shall distinguish between flow exergy, and closed system exergy.
In a closed system, where all mass flows vanish, Eq. (11.4) reduces further
</p>
<p>to
</p>
<p>&minus;d (E &minus; T0S)
dt
</p>
<p>= Ẇ . (11.30)
</p>
<p>Integrating between the actual state {Ea, Sa} and the final equilibrium state
{E0, S0}, and subtracting the work done to the environment, which has con-
stant pressure p0, yields the closed system exergy as</p>

</p>
<p>Flow exergy ψ is defined as the maximum work per unit mass that can
be extracted from a single flow in a steady state process as it is equilibrated
with the environment, that is heat is exchanged only with the environment
and the outflow is in equilibrium with the environment. Thus, from (11.8),

(11.33)
</p>
<p>With these definitions, the combined first and second law (11.4) can be writ-
ten in form of an exergy balance. Use of the mass balance (9.1) to eliminate

<p>12.1 Boiler Exhaust Regeneration
</p>
<p>The discussion of losses in combustion driven systems in the last chapter has
shown that regeneration, i.e., use of exhaust energy by means of heat exchange
within the system, can yield dramatic improvement of engine efficiency. In
direct continuation of the argument, we first discuss regeneration in steam
cycles, which rely on external combustion. For this, we need to consider not
only the steam cycle, but also its heat source, which is hot combustion air.

</p>
<p>Earlier, we have discussed this set up when the heat engine is a Carnot
engine, and have found the exhaust temperature TX for optimum work out-
put, see Sec. 11.7. The discussion showed that the simplest way to utilize the
exhaust heat Q̇E is regeneration by preheating the air before combustion.

<p>Fig. 12.2 Heat engine driven by external combustion with exhaust regeneration
</p>
<p>Figure 12.2 shows the system with an added regenerator for preheating
the air. The heat exchange in the regenerator is, from the first law,
</p>
<p>Q̇R = ṁ (hR &minus; h0) = ṁ (hX &minus; hE) , (12.4)
</p>
<p>where TE is the final exhaust temperature, and TR the preheat temperature.
In a perfect regenerator the preheat temperature would be TX , and the ex-
haust would leave at T0. Accordingly, the regenerator effectiveness is defined
as the ratio between the heat used for preheating, (hR &minus; h0), and the heat
available for preheating, (hX &minus; h0), that is
</p>
<p>ηreg =
hR &minus; h0

<p>. (12.5)

<p>With regenerator, the heat addition from the fuel becomes

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.2 Regenerative Rankine Cycle 259
</p>
<p>where Q̇H = ṁ (hF &minus; hX) is the heat supplied to the heat engine as before.
Thus, with a perfect regenerator (ηreg = 1), we have Q̇H = Q̇F , i.e., all the
heat provided from the fuel arrives in the engine.
</p>
<p>A realistic regenerator has effectiveness of about 80%, and still leads to
a much better fuel usage compared to direct exhaust into the environment.
It must be noted that for several reasons a somewhat elevated exhaust tem-
perature TE is beneficial: The combustion of fossil fuels generates water and
sulfur oxides; the exhaust temperature must be high enough to avoid water
condensation and subsequent formation of sulfuric acid. Also, the combustion
air must be moved through the system, either by means of fans, or by natural
draught chimneys, which rely on the buoyancy of warm air (Sec. 13.8). Since
effective natural draught requires relatively warm exhaust, there is a marked
loss. Therefore, modern power plants use fans.
</p>
<p>From our previous discussion of heat engines we know that efficiency is
high when heat is added at larger temperatures. Thus, for the heat engine
one will aim at having the average temperature for heat addition TH as
high as possible. The temperature TH is limited by the temperature-pressure
characteristics of the working fluid and the materials used for construction.
The maximum steam temperature in steam cycles using steel pipes in the
steam generator is 560 ◦C. The regenerative steam cycles discussed below
aim at raising the average temperature for heat addition, and thus increasing
efficiency.
</p>
<p>External (to the heat engine) irreversibilities occur in the combustion
chamber, and in heat transfer to the heat engine. Our discussion of com-
bustion processes in Chapter 25 will show that combustion irreversibility
decreases with increasing flame temperature TF . On the other hand, heat
transfer irreversibility grows with the temperature difference between com-
bustion product (TF ) and the heat engine (TH). If TH is limited, as is the case
in steam power plants, reduction of TF decreases heat transfer irreversibility,
but increases combustion irreversibility, with the total irreversibility staying
relatively constant. Heat is transferred more easily at larger temperature dif-
ferences, and one can adjust TF for efficient heat transfer. More efficient use
of the fuel is made when the heat engine temperature TH is increased, as in
the combined cycle of Sec. 13.6.
</p>
<p>12.2 Regenerative Rankine Cycle
</p>
<p>With a high average temperature of the combustion gas in the boiler pos-
sible by exhaust regeneration, we now turn to the question of how to raise
the average temperature during heat addition in a steam power plant. The
basic Rankine cycle was already discussed in Sec. 10.1, where we introduced
reheating between turbine stages as one means to this end, Fig. 12.3 repeats
the T-s-diagram and the schematic, with air preheater added to the sketch.
A higher pressure in the steam generator implies higher average temperature.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>260 12 Vapor Engines
</p>
<p>However, direct expansion from high pressure into the condenser (3-4&rsquo;) results
in unacceptably low values for steam quality at the turbine exit, and turbine
blade damage through droplet formation. Reheat at intermediate pressure is
used so that the quality at turbine exit is larger, which implies fewer droplet,
and low blade damage.

<p>Heat is added between states 2 and 3, with rather low temperatures in
the liquid region right after the pump, the boiler feedwater. In a regenerative
Rankine cycle internal heat exchange is used to preheat the feedwater between
pump and boiler. For this, some steam is bled-off after the high pressure
turbine stage (state 4), and then used to heat the feedwater.
</p>
<p>One distinguishes between open feedwater heaters, in which vapor and
water are mixed isobarically, and closed feedwater heaters, where vapor and
feedwater are running through a heat exchanger at different pressures. In
both cases modifications of the cycle are necessary, in order to feed the bled-
off flow back into the cycle, and to adjust pressures. Real life power plants
employ an array of closed and open feedwater heaters to optimize efficiency
and thus increase fuel utilization as much as possible.
</p>
<p>12.2.1 Open Feedwater Heater
</p>
<p>A reheat steam cycle with a single open feedwater heater is depicted in
Fig. 12.4 together with the corresponding T-s-diagram. In the open feedwa-
ter heater, compressed liquid water coming from the low pressure pump (P1,
state 2) is mixed isobarically with some of the steam leaving the high pressure
turbine (T1, state 6). The mixing ratio is adjusted such that the resulting
mixture (state 3) is saturated liquid at the mixing pressure p3 = p2 = p6.
The high pressure pump (P2) compresses this liquid to p4 before it is fed
into the boiler where it is heated, evaporated and superheated to state 5.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.2 Regenerative Rankine Cycle 261
</p>
<p>The high-pressure, high-temperature steam is expanded in the high pressure
turbine and then split into the stream to the feedwater heater, and the main
stream. The latter is reheated in the boiler (6-7), expanded in the low pres-
sure turbine (7-8), condensed (8-1), and compressed (1-2), before it enters
the feedwater heater.
</p>
<p>As the figure indicates, the working fluid undergoes two different cycles.
The main stream ṁA undergoes the full cycle 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-1 (continuous
line), while the mass flow ṁB bled-off after the high pressure turbine under-
goes the cycle 3-4-5-6-3 (dashed line).

process curves are indicated for pumps and turbines.
</p>
<p>The heat added to this process from the fuel is
</p>
<p>Q̇in = (ṁA + ṁB) (h5 &minus; h4) + ṁA (h7 &minus; h6) , (12.7)

<p>and takes place at relatively high temperature. The low temperature heat-
ing 2-3 occurs through internal heat exchange in the open feedwater heater.
Increase of the average temperature for external heat addition increases the
thermal efficiency, and this is why the open feedwater heater gives better
efficiency.
</p>
<p>The mass flow ratio is determined from the energy balance for the feed-
water heater. We assume that the feedwater heater has no heat loss to the
environment, so that
</p>
<p>ṁAh2 + ṁBh6 = (ṁA + ṁB)h3 , (12.8)

<p>12.2.2 Closed Feedwater Heater
</p>
<p>With closed feedwater heaters the streams that exchange heat can be at
different pressures, which gives some additional flexibility for process design.
The bled-off steam must re-enter the main flow after the feedwater heater,
and this can be done either by pumping it into the boiler flow, as depicted in
Fig. 12.5, or by throttling it to lower pressure, for instance into the condenser
as shown in Fig. 12.6. The latter solution is less efficient, since throttling is
highly irreversible.
</p>
<p>We consider the case with pump in detail. Steam is bled-off after the high
pressure turbine (state 6) and runs through the closed feedwater heater (cfwh)

<p>Note that the temperature of the main flow after the feedwater heater, T3,
will be below the temperature of the condensing heating flow, T9.
</p>
<p>The energy balance for the adiabatic mixing chamber reads
</p>
<p>ṁAh3 + ṁBh10 = (ṁA + ṁB)h4 . (12.15)

<p>Heat input, turbine power and pump power are

ẆT = (ṁA + ṁB) (h5 &minus; h6) + ṁA (h7 &minus; h8) &gt; 0 , (12.16)
ẆP = ṁA (h1 &minus; h2) + ṁB (h9 &minus; h10) &lt; 0 .
</p>
<p>and thus the thermal efficiency is
</p>
<p>η =
(1&minus; y) (h1 &minus; h2 + h7 &minus; h8) + y (h9 &minus; h10) + (h5 &minus; h6)

. (12.17)
</p>
<p>If the bled-off flow is simply throttled into the condenser, the total mass
flow ṁA + ṁB must be pumped up and preheated in the feedwater heater.
In this case the energy balance for the feedwater heater is
</p>
<p>(ṁA + ṁB) (h3 &minus; h2) = ṁB (h5 &minus; h8) ,
</p>
<p>which gives the mass flow ratio as

<p>ṁA + ṁB

<p>The thermal efficiency for this cycle can be read from the schematic as

<p>12.2.3 Several Feedwater Heaters
</p>
<p>The example below will give further evidence that regeneration through
feedwater heaters yields improvement of thermal efficiency. Already small
improvements of thermal efficiency lead to significant savings (or increased
profit), and therefore one aims for optimum process configurations. Modern
power plants employ arrays of open and closed feedwater heaters operating
at various pressures.
</p>
<p>Feedwater heaters reduce the external irreversibility in the heat transfer
between the combustion gas and the working fluid in the boiler steam gen-
erators. However, feedwater heaters add internal irreversibilities, due to heat
transfer over finite temperature differences, mixing, and throttling. The sub-
sequent examples will show that the overall irreversibilities of cycles with
feedwater heaters are smaller. With multiple feedwater heaters, the internal
irreversibilities become smaller, since the temperature differences for heat
exchange become smaller. Since irreversibilities imply work loss, plants with
multiple feedwater heaters have higher thermal efficiency, due to smaller irre-
versibilities. While efficiency grows with the number of feedwater heaters, the
increase slows down with the number of heaters. Above a certain number of
heaters, the small increase of efficiency cannot offset the cost for construction
and maintenance, and thus one will limit their number.
</p>
<p>The design of a large power plant with multiple feedwater heaters requires
optimization of the process to determine the number of feedwater heaters,
and the optimal values for the pressures and mass flow rates of the bled-
off flows. This multi-parameter optimization is done by means of computer
programs.
</p>
<p>Figure 12.7 shows a schematic of a 750MW power plant in Germany. The
plant employs three turbine stages at high pressure (HP), intermediate pres-
sure (MP) and low pressure (LP), which drive the generator. The power</p>

<p>for the feedwater pumps is provided by a smaller turbine. Steam is bled-off
from the turbines at a variety of pressures and routed through six feedwater
heaters. The condensate leaving the low pressure feedwater heaters 2 and 4
is pumped up into the main flow, while for the other feedwater heaters the
condensate is throttled into the lower heaters, or the condenser.
</p>
<p>12.3 Example: Steam Cycles with Feedwater Heaters
</p>
<p>We consider the thermal efficiencies for the cycles depicted in Figs. 12.3-12.6
with the following base data:
</p>
<p>condenser pressure: 7.5 kPa
boiler pressure: 125 bar
reheat pressure: 10 bar
high pressure turbine inlet temperature: 500 ◦C
low pressure turbine inlet temperature: 500 ◦C
boiler temperature TB: 900K
standard environmental temperature T0: 298K
</p>
<p>The boiler temperature will be required to estimate the entropy generation
in the heat transfer between boiler and steam cycle. Since all cycles operate
between the boiler temperature TB and the environmental temperature T0,
their efficiencies must be compared to the corresponding Carnot efficiency
ηC = 1&minus; T0TB = 0.669.
</p>
<p>To simplify the discussion, we shall assume that all pumps and turbines
are reversible. Realistic pumps and turbines are irreversible, and add another
source of irreversibility to the discussed cycles. Since all pumps and turbines
are considered to be adiabatic, their entropy generation rates are Ṡgen =
ṁ (sout &minus; sin), where the appropriate mass flow and entropy values must be
used. The latter would be obtained from pressure and enthalpy data, based
on the isentropic irreversibilities.

<p>Compared to the standard reheat cycle, the single closed feedwater with
throttling into the condenser improves thermal efficiency by only &sim; 1%. The
improvement is significantly lower than for the case where the bled-off flow

<p>12.3.5 Summary
</p>
<p>The analysis of the four configurations, one without and three with feedwa-
ter heaters, shows that incorporation of feedwater heaters improves thermal
efficiency of steam cycles. Due to the feedwater heaters, the average tempera-
ture for heat transfer between the working fluid and the boiler is smaller, hence
there is less irreversibility for the boiler processes. All feedwater heaters are as-
sociated with irreversibilities through heat exchange over finite temperature</p>

</p>
<p>difference, mixing, or throttling. The reduction of irreversibility in the boiler
processes is larger than the additional irreversibility associated with the
feedwater heaters, so that overall the irreversibility is reduced, and the pro-
cess performance is improved. For this example, the improvement through
open feedwater heater and closed feedwater heater with pump is similar. The
system with open feedwater heater and throttling into the condenser yields
a smaller improvement, due to the additional irreversibility in the throttling
process; however, this system is cheaper to build and maintain. With more
feedwater heaters employed, the temperature differences for heat transfer, and
the pressure differences for throttling decrease, and thus irreversible losses are
reduced.
</p>
<p>Finally, it must be noted that losses occurring in irreversible pumps and
turbines were ignored, to not overwhelm the computations with more detail.
</p>
<p>12.4 Cogeneration Plants
</p>
<p>12.4.1 Process Heat
</p>
<p>Many industries require process heat and electrical power, for instance the
chemical industry, pulp and paper plants, refineries, textile production, etc.
Cogeneration power plant are variants of the Rankine cycle, which produce
power and provide heat at the required temperature level. Adjustments in
the process allow to provide variable amounts of process heat, depending on
demand. If excess electrical power is produced, this can be sold to the grid,
if more electrical power is needed, it must be purchased from the grid.
</p>
<p>As an example we study a cogeneration plant that produces power and
steam at intermediate pressures and temperatures (say, 5 &minus; 7 bar, 150 &minus;
200 ◦C). Depending on the demand for process heat, steam can be routed into
the process heater either directly from the steam generator (with throttling
to lower the pressure), or it can be drawn out of the turbine at intermediate
pressure, see Fig. 12.8.
</p>
<p>In normal mode, all generated steam is supplied to the turbine, and only
a portion of the steam is extracted from the turbine, that is
</p>
<p>ṁ6 = 0 , ṁ5 
= 0 , ṁ4 
= 0 .
</p>
<p>If the demand for process heat is larger, all steam is taken from the turbine,
so that
</p>
<p>ṁ6 = 0 , ṁ5 
= 0 , ṁ4 = 0 .
This decreases the power generation. Only in case of extremely high demand
one will bypass the turbine entirely, so that
</p>
<p>ṁ6 
= 0 , ṁ5 = 0 , ṁ4 = 0 .</p>

<p>Fig. 12.8 Cogeneration power plant. The plant generates power and process heat.
Depending on demand, steam for the process heater is supplied directly from the
turbine feed flow (State 3), or extracted from the turbine (State 5).
</p>
<p>In this case, only process heat is provided, no electrical power is generated.
From the diagram, we read off the pump and turbine work as
</p>
<p>ẆP = ṁ1 (h1 &minus; h2) + (ṁ5 + ṁ6) (h7 &minus; h8) ,
ẆT = ṁ1 (h3 &minus; h4) + ṁ5 (h3 &minus; h5) ,
</p>
<p>and the net work of the plant is
</p>
<p>Ẇnet = ẆP + ẆT .
</p>
<p>The process heat is

</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣
</p>
<p>∣ = ṁ5 (h5 &minus; h7) + ṁ6 (h6 &minus; h7) ,
</p>
<p>and the heat addition in the steam generator is
</p>
<p>Q̇in = ṁ1 (h3 &minus; h2) + (ṁ5 + ṁ6) (h3 &minus; h8) = (ṁ1 + ṁ5 + ṁ6) (h3 &minus; h2&prime;) .
</p>
<p>The so-called utilization factor of the plant is
</p>
<p>εu =
Ẇnet +

</p>
<p>∣Q̇proc
</p>

<p>∣
</p>
<p>Q̇in
.
</p>
<p>Note that the utilization factor favors use of process heat: For the case where
all heat is used in the process (ṁ5 = ṁ4 = 0), the utilization factor is unity.
However, for the case where no process heat is used (ṁ5 = ṁ6 = 0), the
utilization factor is equal to the thermal efficiency of the plant. Hence, as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.5 Refrigeration Systems 275
</p>
<p>with all efficiency measures, one has to be careful in the interpretation of the
utilization factor.
</p>
<p>12.4.2 District Heating
</p>
<p>Since heat cannot be completely converted to work, a power plant has to
reject heat, typically to the environment. To maximize the work output, the
temperature for heat rejection should be as close as possible to the local en-
vironmental temperature T0. Heat transferred at environmental temperature
has no further use, and thus has no value. For space heating in winter, one
needs heat at somewhat elevated temperature. This heat can be provided
from the heat rejection of power plants in district heating systems. For this,
at times when space heating is required, the plant is operated at elevated
condenser temperature. The condenser heat is rejected into a water circuit
that then is used to bring the heat into buildings. In summer, when no heat-
ing is required, the condenser operates at lower temperatures, and the heat
is rejected directly to the environment. District heating works best when the
distance for heat transmission is short, so that little heat is lost to the envi-
ronment in transmission. Hence, for combined heat and power plants, its is
best to build smaller local power stations, which provide power and heat for
the closer neighborhood, rather than large plants far from consumers. Uti-
lization factors for combined heat and power plants can be defined similar to
those for process heating.
</p>
<p>12.5 Refrigeration Systems
</p>
<p>We return to the discussion of vapor refrigeration and heat pump cycles. The
basic cycle, consisting of compressor, condenser, throttle, and evaporator was
discussed in 10.3. Refrigerators and heat pumps draw heat from a cold envi-
ronment (TL) and reject heat into a warm environment (TH). This transfer of
heat from cold to warm requires work, which in vapor and gas refrigeration
systems is supplied to the compressor. Efficient refrigeration and heat pump
cycles requires: (a) small temperature differences between the working fluid
and the respective environments, and (b) efficient compressors.
</p>
<p>Typically, compressors are adiabatic, which leads to relatively high temper-
ature of the compressed vapor, and therefore to large temperature differences
between the working gas and the warm environment. This implies large en-
tropy generation in heat transfer, hence more work is required to overcome
irreversibilities. Intercooling during compression lowers the work requirement
for compressors (see also Sec. 13.3). Intercooling also leads to lower tempera-
tures after compression, which reduces the work loss to irreversibilities. There
are several ways to incorporate intercooling into refrigeration cycles, which
we now discuss.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>276 12 Vapor Engines
</p>
<p>Multi-stage refrigeration systems are particularly useful when one has to
bridge a large temperature difference between the cold and warm environ-
ment, as, e.g., in the production of frozen food. Heat pumps normally operate
on smaller temperature differences, and multi-stage compression is not used.
</p>
<p>12.5.1 Cascade Refrigeration System
</p>
<p>In a cascade refrigeration system two or more refrigeration cycles operate on
top of each other. Figure 12.9 shows an example with two cycles A and B
connected by a closed heat exchanger, which serves as evaporator for cycle
A, and as condenser for cycle B.
</p>
<p>With the closed heat exchanger, the working fluids of the two cycles re-
main separated. Thus, the two cycles can employ different cooling fluids,
and operate at different pressures; cooling fluids can be chosen with the best
temperature-pressure characteristics in the respective temperature ranges.
For simplicity, the T-s-diagram is drawn for the case that both cycles use the
same working fluid, and for the case of reversible compressors.

<p>The T-s-diagram in Fig. 12.9 also indicates state 2&prime;, which would be the
compressor exit state in a single stage system. The corresponding temper-
ature T2&prime; is significantly above the temperature TH of the heat receiving
environment. The two stage system reaches the maximum temperature T6,
which is not as high, and has smaller temperature differences in all heat
transfer processes, and thus lower irreversibility, and better COP.
</p>
<p>12.5.2 Refrigeration with Flash Chamber
</p>
<p>If only a single refrigerant is to be used, there are alternatives to design
multi-stage refrigeration cycles that do not need closed heat exchangers, and
use simpler open heat exchangers. Figure 12.10 shows a two-stage refriger-
ation system which uses a flash chamber at intermediate pressure to divide
the exit flow of the upper throttle into saturated liquid and saturated vapor.
The saturated liquid (state 7) is throttled further into the evaporator. The
saturated vapor (state 9) is mixed with the vapor leaving the low pressure
compressor (state 2); the mixture (state 3) is fed into the high pressure com-
pressor. Effectively, this cycle compresses with intercooling to temperature
T3.
</p>
<p>The mass flow ṁA goes through the cycle 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-1, and the mass
flow ṁB goes through the cycle 3-4-5-6-3. Both mass flows are related through
the quality x6 of state 6,

<p>12.6 Linde Method for Gas Liquefaction
</p>
<p>Liquefaction of air, and other gases, provides low temperatures, and offers a
method to separate gas mixtures by distillation. For instance, steel mills have
their own air liquefaction plants to separate oxygen from air. The oxygen is
needed to remove carbon from the pig iron that leaves the blast furnace.
</p>
<p>The Linde method is a classical approach to achieve this goal, by throttling
pressurized gas. For gases the critical point is relatively low, e.g., for air
Tcr = 132.5K, pcr = 37.7 bar, and thus the process must include a pre-
cooling stage.

<p>12.6 Linde Method for Gas Liquefaction 279
</p>
<p>For air liquefaction, the process runs as shown in Fig. 12.11: Air at envi-
ronmental conditions (T1 = 298K, p1 = 1bar) is compressed in a multi-stage
compressor with intercooling to a high pressure p2 ≃ 200 bar. Intercooling is
necessary to reduce the work for compression as much as possible; for simplic-
ity the T-s-diagram in the figure shows isothermal compression at T2 = T1.
Next the compressed air is pre-cooled isobarically in the regenerator to a
temperature T3, and then throttled to p1. The temperature T3 must be suf-
ficiently low, so that state 4 after throttling is in the two-phase region. In a
flash chamber the flow is divided into saturated liquid&mdash;the desired product
P&mdash;and saturated vapor (state 5) which is routed through the pre-cooler. Ob-
viously, the conditions for this process are such that air cannot be described
as an ideal gas; proper tables for air as superheated vapor and saturated
liquid-vapor mix are required.
</p>
<p>Due to the use of throttling, the Linde process is inherently irreversible,
and thus requires more work than a reversible process for the same task. As
we have seen, all refrigeration systems suffer from irreversibilities, and there
is little alternative to this process for large scale gas liquefaction.

A steam power plant operates on a reheat-regenerative Rankine cycle with
an open feedwater heater. Steam enters the high-pressure turbine at 100 bar,
550 ◦C, and leaves at a pressure of 8 bar as saturated vapor. Some steam is
extracted at this pressure to heat the feedwater in an open feedwater heater
which provides saturated liquid. The rest of the steam is reheated to 500 ◦C
and then expanded in the low pressure turbine to the condenser pressure of
10 kPa.

closed feedwater heater. Steam enters the turbine at 12.5MPa, 550 ◦C, the
condenser pressure is 10 kPa. Steam for the closed feedwater heater is ex-
tracted from the turbine at 0.8MPa and for the open feedwater heater at
0.3MPa. The feedwater is heated to the condensation temperature of the
stream for the closed feedwater heater. The extracted steam leaves the closed

heater.

<p>12.7. Steam Power Plant with Reheat and Two Feedwater Heaters,

The boiler pressure in a reheat steam power plant is 150 bar, the reheat
pressure is 14 bar, and the condenser pressure is 10 kPa. For both turbines,
the inlet temperature is 500 ◦C. After the high pressure turbine, some steam is
bled-off and routed to the closed feedwater heater where it is fully condensed,
and then pumped into the boiler feedwater. The remaining steam is reheated,
and then runs through the low pressure turbine. Part of the flow is bled-off
from the turbine at a pressure of 4 bar, while the main flow expands into the
condenser. The diverted flow is mixed in the open feedwater heater with the
flow that is pumped in from the condenser. The resulting mixture, which is in
the saturated liquid state, is then pumped to boiler pressure before it enters
the closed feedwater heater.

pressure is 15 bar, and the condenser pressure is 10 kPa. For both turbines,
the inlet temperature is 500 ◦C. After the high pressure turbine, some steam is
bled-off and routed to the o.f.w.h. The remaining steam is reheated, and then
runs through the low pressure turbine. Part of the flow is bled-off from the
turbine at a pressure of 5 bar. This flow is further routed through the c.f.w.h.,
where it fully condenses, and is then pumped into the o.f.w.h. The main flow
expands into the condenser, which it leaves as saturated liquid. This flow is
pumped to the o.f.w.h. pressure, heated in the c.f.w.h., and then mixed with
the other flows in the o.f.w.h. The resulting mixture in the o.f.w.h., which is

<p>12.11. Cogeneration Power Plant
A cogeneration power plant with reheat produces 3MW of power and supplies
7MW of process heat. Steam enters the isentropic high-pressure turbine at
8MPa and 500 ◦C and expands to a pressure of 1MPa. At this pressure, part
of the steam is extracted from the turbine and routed to the process heater;
this stream leaves the process heater as compressed liquid at 120 ◦C. The
remaining steam is reheated to 500 ◦C and then expanded in the isentropic
low-pressure turbine to the condenser pressure of 15 kPa. The condensate is
pumped to 1MPa and then mixed with the stream of compressed liquid that
comes from the process heater. The mixture is then pumped to the boiler
pressure.

condenser pressure 0.075 bar (state 4). After condensation to saturated liquid
state (state 5) this stream is pumped isentropically to 10 bar (state 6) and</p>

<p>routed into the open feedwater heater. Part of the steam extracted after
the high pressure turbine (state 2) is used for process heating. For this, the
steam passes through a heat exchanger which it leaves as compressed liquid
at 60 ◦C (state 7) that is fed into the open feedwater heater. The rest of the
extracted steam of state 2 is directly routed into the feedwater heater. The
water leaving the feedwater heater is in the saturated liquid state (state 8);
an isentropic pump increases its pressure to the boiler pressure (state 9).

<p>12.13. District Heating
A 40MW power plant is to be build to supply electrical power to a small town
in the North where, due to the low average temperature, a large amount of
space heating is required. One proposal suggest to set the condenser pressure
a bit higher, so that the condenser is at temperature TC1, and to use the
removed heat for district heating. An alternative proposal suggests to set the
condenser to the lower temperature TC2 so that the turbine delivers more
work, which can then be used to run heat pumps between TC1 and TC2.
Discuss these proposals and make a recommendation to town council. Use
thermodynamic arguments (of course!), it might be helpful to draw pictures
with energy flows and temperatures.

</p>
<p>13.1.1 The Ideal Stirling Cycle
</p>
<p>We have pointed out again and again that effective energy conversion requires
the reduction of internal and external irreversibilities as much as possible. An
important cause of external irreversibility is heat transfer between the sys-
tem and its heat sources and sinks, e.g., a stream of combustion gas, or the
environment. The related loss can be reduced if heat that is rejected in one
process of a cycle can be added elsewhere within the system. This simulta-
neously reduces the heat rejection and the heat supply from the exterior,
thus leading to efficiency improvements. Indeed, regeneration, i.e., internal
exchange of heat within a system, is the most important tool to reduce ex-
ternal irreversibilities, and increase efficiency. Historically, the first engine
which used a regenerator was the Stirling engine.
</p>
<p>The idealized Stirling cycle consists of two isothermal and two isochoric
processes, taking place at temperatures TH and TL, and volumes V1, V2,
respectively. The working medium is an ideal gas, e.g., air or helium, which is
confined permanently in a cylinder. The T-S- and p-V-diagrams are depicted
in Fig. 13.1.
</p>
<p>We ignore all internal irreversibilities, so that work and heat for the re-
versible processes within the ideal Stirling cycle are

</p>
<p>Fig. 13.1 Idealized Stirling power cycle in p-V- and T&ndash;s-diagrams
</p>
<p>Since internal energy of the ideal gas depends only on temperature, u = u (T ),
it turns out that the heats exchanged during the isochoric processes are equal,
but of opposite sign,1
</p>
<p>q23 = u (TL)&minus; u (TH) = &minus;q41 . (13.2)
</p>
<p>With this, the heat q23, which is rejected during the isochoric cooling process,
can be used for the isochoric heating q41. In the Stirling engine, this is done
by means of the regenerator, which allows for internal heat exchange. The
working principle of the regenerator will be discussed further below.
</p>
<p>When a regenerator is employed, the heat q41 is exchanged internally, and
only the heat q12 must be provided from the outside, e.g., by burning a fuel.
The thermal efficiency is obtained, with (13.1), as
</p>
<p>ηSt =
w⊙
qin
</p>
<p>=
w12 + w34
</p>
<p>q12
= 1&minus; TL
</p>
<p>TH
. (13.3)
</p>
<p>In case that TL and TH are the temperatures of reservoirs with which the cycle
exchanges heat, the above is just the Carnot efficiency, that is the maximum
efficiency for a process operating between reservoirs at temperatures TH and
TL. It follows that the ideal Stirling process with regenerator is a realization
of a Carnot engine, as long as the heat transfer with the reservoirs takes
places at infinitesimal temperature difference.
</p>
<p>We note that the amounts of heat exchanged during the isochoric processes,
q23 and q41, can only be equal in size for an ideal gas (with variable or constant
specific heats), for which internal energy does not depend on specific volume,
u = u (T ) and not u = u (T, v). This is different for the Carnot cycle&mdash;another
realization of a Carnot engine&mdash;which has the same efficiency independent of
the working medium.
</p>
<p>1 This implies that in the T-s-diagram the areas below the curves 2-3 and 4-1 are
equal.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.1 Stirling Cycle 291
</p>
<p>Although the efficiency is independent of the type of ideal gas used, most
Stirling engines use helium or hydrogen as working medium. The high heat
conductivity of gases with low molecular masses leads to a faster heat ex-
change and thus allows to operate the engine at a higher frequency.
</p>
<p>The power output of the engine depends on the mass m enclosed in the
cylinder, and the rotation speed ṅ of the engine,
</p>
<p>Ẇ = ṅmw⊙ . (13.4)
</p>
<p>Fast changes in power demand, as they are necessary for use in cars, can
be achieved by changing the amount of working gas in the cylinder, i.e., by
pumping additional mass in or out. This, of course, adds to the complexity
of the process. It is therefore no surprise that most of today&rsquo;s applications of
the Stirling engine consider systems which run at constant load, and generate
electricity, in particular with heat supply from solar collectors.
</p>
<p>13.1.2 Working Principle of a Stirling Engine
</p>
<p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to build an engine that operates on the ideal
Stirling cycle. All real Stirling engines approximate the ideal cycle to some
extent. There are many different working principles for Stirling engines, and
here we discuss the operating principle of a Leybold Stirling engine for use in
teaching laboratories, which operates in the same way as the original Stirling
engine.2
</p>
<p>The lab engine, sketched in Fig. 13.2, consists of a glass cylinder in which
two pistons&mdash;the working piston and the displacement piston&mdash;move verti-
cally with a phase shift of 90◦. Mounted on top of the cylinder is the heating
coil (electrical heating), which maintains the upper part of the engine at high
temperature (TH). The lower part of the cylinder is encased by a second glass
cylinder, with cooling water flowing between the two cylinders and through
the bottom of the displacement piston to maintain the lower part of the
engine at low temperature (TL).
</p>
<p>The displacement piston shifts the gas between the upper high-
temperature part of the engine and the lower low-temperature part. The
movement of the displacement piston forces the gas through a cylindrical
hole in the displacement piston that is filled with copper wool which acts
as the regenerator. As the gas passes from the hot part of the engine to the
cold part, the gas cools gradually by giving up heat to the copper wool. On
the way back the gas takes heat from the regenerator and is thus gradually
heated. The working piston seals the gas against the environment and serves
to compress or expand it while exchanging work with the environment.
</p>
<p>The actual thermodynamic cycle of the Stirling engine differs somewhat
from the idealized Stirling cycle, see Fig. 13.3 for a qualitative comparison
</p>
<p>2 This engine is used in the teaching laboratory at the University of Victoria.</p>

<p>of the idealized and the real cycle. In order to understand how the Stirling
engine approximates the ideal cycle, it is best to study the p-V-diagram in
Fig. 13.3, which also shows the displacement of the two pistons as function
of the shaft angle.
</p>
<p>I. Isothermal expansion: The displacement piston is at bottom dead cen-
ter, almost at rest, so that most of the working gas is in the upper hot
zone. The working piston moves downward and the gas expands, the heat
supplied is transferred to work.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.1 Stirling Cycle 293
</p>
<p>II. Isochoric cooling: The working piston is at bottom dead center, so that
the total gas volume is (almost) fixed. The displacement piston is moving
upwards and the working gas streams into the lower cold part of the
engine. While flowing through the regenerator (copper wool), the gas
transfers heat to the regenerator.
</p>
<p>III. Isothermal compression: The displacement piston is at top dead center,
and the working gas is in the lower cool part of the cylinder. The working
piston moves upwards compressing the gas. The gas releases heat to the
cooling water so that the gas temperature remains nearly constant.
</p>

</p>
<p>The main reasons why the measured p-V-diagram deviates from the ideal
one, and assumes the more oval form shown in Fig. 13.3 are:
</p>
<p>1. Truly isochoric processes require that the working piston is at rest. How-
ever, since it is driven by a crankshaft, the working piston moves sinu-
soidally.
</p>
<p>2. Compression and expansion (I and III) are fast, and do not take place
isothermally.
</p>
<p>3. The heating coil releases heat into the gas at all times, not only during
step I .
</p>
<p>4. Part of the working gas remains in the cool part of the engine at all times.
5. The regenerator is not 100% efficient.
6. Heat losses to the environment and friction dissipate energy.
7. Insufficient sealing leads to exchange of gas with the outside.</p>

<p>13.1.3 The Reverse Stirling Cycle
</p>
<p>A Stirling engine can also operate as a refrigeration engine or a heat pump.
In both cases the engine is driven by a motor, and the process curve in
the p-V-diagram runs counter-clockwise, see Fig. 13.4 for the ideal process
curve. During the isothermal processes (1-2, 3-4) heat is exchanged with
the environment of the engine, while the heat transfer during the isochoric
processes (2-3, 4-1) is an internal heat exchange by means of the regenerator.
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.4 Stirling refrigeration cycle in p-V- and T&ndash;s-diagrams
</p>
<p>We find for the branches of this cycle the following exchange of heat and
work with the environment:

<p>&lt; 0 , q12 = RTH ln

</p>

</p>
<p>As for the Stirling heat engine, the heats for the isochoric processes have the
same absolute value, q23 = &minus;q41, and the regenerator ensures internal heat
exchange.

Carnot engines, i.e., the maximum COP&rsquo;s that can be reached between the
temperatures TH , TL.
</p>
<p>The lab engine can run as both, heat pump and refrigerator. If run as a
heat pump, the lower, water cooled, part of the engine is the cold part of the
engine (at TL) and heat is pumped to the upper part of the engine which
becomes hot (TH). When the operating direction of the engine is reversed,
the lower, water cooled, part of the engine becomes the hot part of the engine
(at TH) and heat is pumped away from the upper part of the engine which
becomes cold (TL), the engine operates as a refrigerator.
</p>
<p>13.1.4 Stirling Engines Then and Now
</p>
<p>The Stirling engine was patented in 1816 by Robert Stirling (1790-1878), a
minister of the Church of Scotland. At that time, steam engines had a rather
low efficiency (2-10%), and were quite unsafe. Boilers exploded often, and
the high pressure steam that was released had scalding effects. The Stirling
hot-air engine was promising to overcome both problems: The regenerator
gave it a good efficiency, and in the unlikely case of a bursting engine, only
hot air was released so that the consequences of an accident were far less
severe. However, the Stirling engine could never live up to the expectations.
While the steam turbine was improved more and more to today&rsquo;s efficiencies
of over 45%, and internal combustion engines, i.e., Otto and Diesel engines,
prevailed for the use in cars and trucks, Stirling engines almost vanished from
the scene.
</p>
<p>Unlike an internal combustion engine, a Stirling engine does not exchange
the working gas in each cycle, but contains the gas permanently. The heat
is supplied outside the engine, so that any heat source is suitable to power a
Stirling engine. Thus, a Stirling engine can be driven by carbon fuels (coal,
natural gas, gasoline, Diesel oil), hydrogen, solar radiation, nuclear power,
waste heat of industrial processes, etc. If a fuel is used, it is burned con-
tinuously, with lower emissions than in a reciprocating internal combustion
engine.
</p>
<p>Stirling refrigeration engines can give very low temperatures, and are
widely used for small scale cryogenic cooling. A promising application for
Stirling heat engines is the conversion of solar energy into electricity by means
of parabolic mirror dishes with Stirling engines in the focus. While these de-
vices can only operate under direct sunlight, they can be far more efficient
than photovoltaic cells.
</p>
<p>At present it is not possible to build a high efficiency Stirling engine at
a competitive price. In order to have a high specific power (kW per litre of
engine capacity), the working gas must be highly pressurized (goal: up to
190 bar), causing problems of sealing against the environment and lubrica-
tion. It is at the seals where a large portion of mechanical losses occur. The</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>296 13 Gas Engines
</p>
<p>efficiency increases with the temperature difference between the cold and the
hot part of the engine. Thus, highly efficient engines require non-standard
materials that can operate at temperatures of 750 ◦C and more.

</p>
<p>13.2 Ericsson Cycle
</p>
<p>The Stirling cycle operates in piston-cylinder assemblies, in closed systems.
The Ericsson cycle is very similar, only that it consists of open system devices,
namely isothermal turbine and compressor, and isobaric heat exchangers;
again, the working fluid is an ideal gas. Figure 13.5 shows the correspond-
ing p-V- and T-s-diagrams. Since we consider open system devices for the
realization of the cycle, the corresponding work and heat contributions are
</p>
<p>1-2 compressor at TL: w12 = &minus;RTL ln p2p1 &lt; 0 , q12 = &minus;RTL ln
p2
p1
</p>
<p>&lt; 0 ,
</p>
<p>2-3 heating at p2: w23 = 0 , q23 = h (TH)&minus; h (TL) &gt; 0 ,
3-4 turbine at TH : w34 = &minus;RTH ln p1p2 &gt; 0 , q34 = &minus;RTH ln
</p>

p2
</p>
<p>&gt; 0 ,
</p>
<p>4-1 cooling at p2: w41 = 0 , q41 = h (TL)&minus; h (TH) &lt; 0 .
</p>
<p>Since the enthalpy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature, but not on
pressure, the amounts of heat exchanged on the isobaric legs are equal in mag-
nitude with opposite signs: a regenerator can be used for internal exchange of
heat. In fact, the regenerator must be a counter-flow heat exchanger, which
leads to the schematic shown in Fig. 13.6.
</p>
<p>With the use of the regenerator, only the heat q34 must be supplied from
the outside, and the thermal efficiency of the ideal cycle becomes

<p>This, again, is the Carnot efficiency, that is the best possible efficiency obtain-
able from a heat engine operating between reservoirs at temperatures TH , TL.</p>

</p>
<p>As the Stirling engine, the Ericsson engine uses external heat supply, which,
in principle, allows the use of any heat source.
</p>
<p>The Ericsson cycle relies on isothermal turbine and compressor, which
require heat exchange during compression and expansion. Since heat transfer
is slow, these are difficult to realize: Fast compressors and turbines normally
are adiabatic, since the mass flows through too fast so that there is no time
for significant heat transfer. Adiabatic compression with intercooling, and
adiabatic expansion with reheat, together with regeneration, as discussed in
the next sections, are means to bring gas turbine cycles closer to the Ericsson
cycle, and thus improve their efficiency.
</p>
<p>13.3 Compression with Intercooling
</p>
<p>The work required in a reversible compressor which compresses an ideal gas
from pressure p1 to pressure p2 is given by Eq. (9.25),
</p>
<p>wC = &minus;
&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>vdp . (13.9)
</p>
<p>Thus, as discussed earlier, the work is the area to the left of the process curve
in the p-v-diagram, see Sec. 9.6; less work is required for smaller specific
volume of the compressed substance.
</p>
<p>Figure 13.7 shows the curves for an isothermal and an adiabatic compressor
in the p-v-diagram, in the reversible case. The adiabatic curve is steeper
than the isothermal curve (Sec. 7.7), since in the isothermal process the
cooling during compression ensures a smaller specific volume. Therefore the
isothermal compressor requires less work than the adiabatic one.
</p>
<p>For an isothermal compressor we have v = RT1/p, and the work is wC =
&minus;RT1 ln p2p1 , while for an adiabatic compressor, assuming constant specific</p>

<p>Fig. 13.7 Adiabatic (1-2) and isothermal (1-2&rsquo;) compressor in p-V-diagram. The
grey area is the difference in the compressor work.
</p>
<p>Obviously, to reduce the work requirement one would aim at isothermal
compression. However, isothermal compression requires cooling during com-
pression which is impossible to achieve for the large throughputs required,
and cannot be used in practice.
</p>
<p>An alternative is offered by multi-stage compressors with intercooling, in
which the gas is compressed adiabatically in each stage, and then isobari-
cally cooled to the environmental temperature T1 before it enters the next
stage. Intercooling reduces the gas volume, and thus the work requirement is
reduced. As an example, Fig. 13.8 shows a three stage compressor with inter-
cooling. As more stages are used, the process curve approaches the isothermal
curve. It should be noted that construction is more costly than for a single
stage compressor.
</p>
<p>The work savings depend on the pressures chosen for intercooling, which
must be optimized. We consider an n-stage compressor which takes in gas at
p1, T1, and compresses it to the final pressure pe; between each stage the gas
is cooled back to T1. Stage i compresses from T1, pi to pi+1, and requires the
work
</p>
<p>wCi =
h (T1)&minus; h (Ti+1)
</p>
<p>ηCi
, (13.10)
</p>
<p>where ηCi is the isentropic efficiency of stage i. The temperature at the exit
of an adiabatic reversible compressor between the same pressures, Ti+1, is
</p>
<p>obtained from the relation pr(Ti+1)pr(T1) =
pi+1
pi
</p>
<p>. Accordingly, the reversible work
</p>
<p>wC,rev (Pi) = h (T1) &minus; h (Ti+1) is a function of the pressure ratio P = pi+1pi
for the stage, and we can write</p>

In case that the isentropic compressor efficiency depends on the pressure

<p>within the compressor, one has to evaluate (13.14). We note that the above
argument is valid also for polytropic compressors, as long as the polytropic
exponent for all compressors is the same.
</p>
<p>13.4 Gas Turbine Cycles with Regeneration and
Reheat
</p>
<p>13.4.1 Regenerative Brayton Cycle
</p>
<p>We return to the discussion of the Brayton cycle, which was introduced in
Sec. 10.5. As is evident from the discussion there, in particular from the T-s-
diagram, the Brayton cycle expels rather warm exhaust into the environment.
Since the exhaust is warmer than the environment, it has a work potential as
was shown in Sec. 11.6. If the exhaust is just blown into the environment, this
work potential remains unused. The ensuing equilibration between exhaust
and environment is an irreversible process&mdash;it is an external irreversibility
for the gas turbine.
</p>
<p>To recover at least a portion of the exhaust work potential, the exhaust can
be lead through a regenerator to heat the compressed air before it enters the
combustion chamber. With this, less heat must be supplied from the outside,
and the efficiency is increased.
</p>

<p>goes from warm to cold, the preheat temperature Tx cannot be larger than
the turbine exhaust temperature T4, while the final exhaust temperature Ty
cannot be smaller than T2. Thus, the use of a regenerator makes only sense
when the turbine exhaust temperature T4 is larger than the temperature after
compression, T2.
</p>
<p>A perfect heat exchanger would yield Tx = T4 and this is used to define
the regenerator effectiveness as3
</p>
<p>ηreg =
hx &minus; h2
h4 &minus; h2
</p>
<p>. (13.19)
</p>
<p>A 100% effective regenerator would transfer heat at infinitesimal temperature
differences, a realistic regenerator operates with finite temperature differences
and around 80% effectiveness. The exhaust temperature Ty follows from the
energy balance over the regenerator, assuming that no heat is lost to the
exterior, as
</p>
<p>h (Ty) = hy = h4 &minus; hx + h2 . (13.20)
The regenerator reduces the amount of heat that must be supplied from
</p>
<p>the fuel, which is qx3 = h3 &minus; hx. Accordingly, the thermal efficiency for the
depicted cycle 1&minus; 2&minus; x&minus; 3&minus; 4&minus; y is given by
</p>
<p>ηB,reg =
h1 &minus; h2 + h3 &minus; h4
</p>
<p>h3 &minus; hx
= 1&minus;
</p>
<p>h4 &minus; h1 &minus; ηreg (h4 &minus; h2)
h3 &minus; h2 &minus; ηreg (h4 &minus; h2)
</p>
<p>. (13.21)
</p>
<p>For ηreg = 0, this reduces to the thermal efficiency of the standard Brayton
</p>
<p>cycle, ηB = 1&minus; h4&minus;h1h3&minus;h2 . For non-zero effectiveness, the efficiency is larger than
ηB. This follows from the fact that, because 0 &lt; ηB &lt; 1, h4 &minus; h1 &lt; h3 &minus; h2,
which implies that with growing regenerator effectiveness ηreg the thermal
efficiency ηB,reg grows as well.
</p>
<p>The actual improvement depends on the detailed data of the process.

perature only, h = h (T ).</p>

<p>First, we consider the fully reversible cycle, with 100% effective regenera-
tor. For this, according to (13.19, 13.20), the preheat temperature after the
regenerator is Tx = T4s, and the exhaust temperature is Ty = T2s. With the
computed temperatures, we find the specific work of the reversible cycle as
</p>
<p>w⊙ = cp (T1 &minus; T2s + T3 &minus; T4s) = 454.8
kJ
</p>
<p>kg
,
</p>
<p>and the thermal efficiencies of the cycle without and with regenerator are
</p>
<p>ηB =
T1 &minus; T2s + T3 &minus; T4s
</p>
<p>T3 &minus; T2s
= 48.2% ,
</p>
<p>ηB,reg =
T1 &minus; T2s + T3 &minus; T4s
</p>
<p>T3 &minus; Tx
= 62.7% .
</p>
<p>We see that a regenerator can give substantial improvement for cycle
efficiency.
</p>
<p>With the regenerator, the external loss is reduced, since the exhaust tem-
perature, and thus the external irreversibility, is lowered considerably. Indeed,
the exhaust of the cycle without regenerator (temperature Tx = T4s) has the
work potential
</p>
<p>wex = cp

.
</p>
<p>Recall that the work potential of the exhaust is lost, since the exhaust is
dumped into the environment. For this example, the regenerator reduces the
exhaust loss by about 60%.</p>

<p>13.5 Brayton Cycle with Intercooling and Reheat 303
</p>
<p>All efficiency values in the above example are relatively high, since no
internal irreversibilities are accounted for. To study how internal irreversibil-
ities affect the results, we now assume isentropic efficiencies for compressor
and turbine of ηT = ηC = 0.85, and a regenerator effectiveness of ηreg = 0.8.
</p>
<p>Then, we find the temperatures after compressor and turbine as
</p>
<p>T2 = T1 +
T2s &minus; T1
</p>
<p>ηC
= 618K , T4 = T3 + ηT (T4s &minus; T3) = 885K ,
</p>
<p>and the temperatures after heat exchange in the regenerator, from (13.19,
13.20), as
</p>
<p>Tx = T2 + ηreg (T4 &minus; T2) = 832K , Ty = T4 &minus; Tx + T2 = 671K .
</p>
<p>The specific work for the cycle is now
</p>
<p>w⊙ = cp (T1 &minus; T2 + T3 &minus; T4) = 288
kJ
</p>
<p>kg
,
</p>
<p>and the thermal efficiencies for the cycle with and without regenerator are
</p>
<p>ηB =
T1 &minus; T2 + T3 &minus; T4
</p>
<p>T3 &minus; T2
= 32.5% ,
</p>
<p>ηB,reg =
T1 &minus; T2 + T3 &minus; T4
</p>
<p>T3 &minus; Tx
= 43% .
</p>
<p>The corresponding work potentials of the dumped exhaust are wex = 273
kJ
kg
</p>
<p>and wex,reg = 138
kJ
kg , i.e., the regenerator reduces the exhaust loss by 50%.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the exhaust still has significant work potential, which is about
50% of the work actually delivered by the system. Another heat engine can be
used to produce work from the exhaust&mdash;see the discussion of the combined
cycle further below.
</p>
<p>For motivation of the next section we compute the ratio between compres-
sor and turbine work, i.e., the back work ratio, for this cycle as

<p>13.5 Brayton Cycle with Intercooling and Reheat
</p>
<p>Our discussion of compressors has shown that multi-stage compression with
intercooling reduces the work required for compression. Applying this idea in
a gas turbine cycle reduces the back work ratio, and also the temperature T2
behind the compressor. When a regenerator is used, the exhaust temperature
Ty is limited by the temperature T2 after compression, which is lower with</p>

<p>multi-stage compression. Lower exhaust temperature Ty lowers the external
irreversibility, and thus gives better efficiency.
</p>
<p>In short, further efficiency gain can be obtained by using multi-stage com-
pression with intercooling together with regeneration. Figure 13.10 shows
schematic and T-s-diagram for a system with two-stage compression and re-
generator that also includes two turbines stages with intermediate reheat.
</p>
<p>Reheat increases the average temperature for heating, and thus the effi-
ciency. The optimum reheat pressure can be determined by maximizing work,
similar to the discussion is Sec. 13.3. If the turbines have the same inlet tem-
perature, and the same isentropic efficiency, the maximum work is obtained
when they have the same pressure ratio.
</p>
<p>Since reheat increases the turbine exit temperature, reheat will increase the
thermal efficiency only if accompanied by regeneration. The thermal efficiency
of this cycle is obtained as
</p>
<p>η =
wC1 + wC2 + wT1 + wT2

= 1&minus; ha &minus; h1 + h2 &minus; hb + h4 &minus; hx
</p>
<p>(h3 &minus; hx) + (hd &minus; hc)
. (13.22)
</p>
<p>With intercooling and reheat, a larger portion of the heat can be exchanged
in the regenerator, which reduces the exhaust temperature Ty and the corre-
sponding exhaust loss, thus increasing the thermal efficiency. With more and</p>

</p>
<p>more intercooling and reheat stages, the process becomes more similar to the
Ericsson process.
</p>
<p>13.6 Combined Cycle
</p>
<p>As we have seen, even in a gas turbine with regeneration there are significant
exhaust losses. An alternative to regeneration is using the gas turbine exhaust
to provide heat for another heat engine. In the combined cycle the gas turbine
exhaust is used in a heat recovery steam generator (HSRG) to provide heat for
a steam power cycle. Figure 13.11 shows schematic and energy flow diagram
for the combination of a standard Brayton cycle with a standard Rankine
cycle. Real power plants use state of the art regenerative steam cycles (see
Section 12.2).4

<p>In order to evaluate the combined cycle, we consider a gas turbine cycle
with thermal efficiency ηGT and a steam cycle with thermal efficiency ηSC ,
which are connected by an HSRG with effectiveness ηHSRG.
</p>
<p>The heat into the system from combustion in the gas turbine is Q̇in. The
gas turbine cycle produces the work

<p>4 In case that the gas exhaust from the HRSG still has marked work potential, a
regenerator can be added to the gas cycle for preheating of the combustion air

<p>and rejects the heat

<p>to the HSRG. The latter delivers the heat

<p>Q̇SC = ηHSRGQ̇

GT = ηHSRG (1&minus; ηGT ) Q̇in
</p>
<p>to the steam cycle, which thus produces the power
</p>
<p>ẆSC = ηSCQ̇SC = ηSCηHSRG (1&minus; ηGT ) Q̇in .
</p>
<p>The combined power output of both cycles is
</p>
<p>Ẇ = ẆGT + ẆSC = (ηGT + ηSCηHSRG (1&minus; ηGT )) Q̇in ,
</p>
<p>which gives the thermal efficiency of the combined cycle as
</p>
<p>η =
Ẇ
</p>
<p>Q̇in
= ηGT + ηSCηHSRG (1&minus; ηGT ) .
</p>
<p>The efficiency of the combined cycle is always greater than the efficiency of the
gas turbine alone (unless ηHSRG = 0), and is also larger than the efficiency of
the steam cycle alone as long as ηHSRG is large enough (in particular η &gt; ηSC
if ηHRSG = 1).
</p>
<p>A gas turbine with ηGT = 0.31 combined with a steam cycle of ηSC = 0.45
by means of a HRSG with ηHRSG = 0.9 has an overall efficiency of 60%.
Indeed, combined cycle power plants have the highest available efficiencies
among all combustion driven power plants. They allow large upper temper-
atures in the gas turbines, and reject heat at relatively low temperatures.
The only drawback to their use is that they require gaseous or liquid fuels,
and cannot be fed directly with coal. Recall that the average efficiency of
the World&rsquo;s combustion power plants is about 35% or less. Much better use
of fossil fuels could be made by using coal gasification or liquefaction and
combined cycle plants.

<p>13.7 The Solar Tower
</p>
<p>We mentioned solar power conversion as an application for Stirling engines.
Here, we discuss an interesting application for solar power conversion, which
relies on the chimney effect, which, in turn, relies on the variation of air
pressure with height as expressed in the barometric formula (2.25).
</p>
<p>The solar tower, or solar chimney, sketched in Fig. 13.12, works as follows:
Solar radiation provides heat Q̇⊙ which passes through a glass roof, is ab-
sorbed by black mats on the ground, and the warm mats heat up air. The</p>

<p>Fig. 13.12 Solar Tower. The sketch shows a cut trough a circular device.
</p>
<p>warm air rises through the chimney and drives turbines which are connected
to a generator to produce the power Ẇ . When a layer of water is placed
below the black mats (e.g., one might use black sacks filled with water), the
heat provided from the sun goes partly into air and partly into the water.
When the solar heat supply stops after sunset, the warm water heats the air,
and the tower still produces electricity until the water has cooled down. An
experimental plant with a 180m tower was build some years ago in Spain,
plans to build a tower with a height of 1000m and a diameter of the glass
roof of 6 km in Australia are presently on hold.
</p>
<p>We aim at a thermodynamic evaluation of the solar tower, and ask in
particular for its thermal efficiency. The temperatures involved are rather
low, and thus we can use the cold air approximation, i.e., we assume the
specific heats of air to be constants. The exterior air is assumed to have
constant temperature T0, and the pressure depends on height z according to
the barometric formula, p (z) = p0 exp
</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>&minus; gzRT
]
</p>
<p>with p0 the pressure at the
ground.
</p>
<p>The incoming air is at {T0, p0}, and as it flows towards the turbines it is
heated isobarically until it reaches the temperature T1 just before the tur-
bines. To compute this temperature, we apply the first law for open systems
between the outer rim and the point just before the turbine. Since the radius
is large, the flow velocity V0 at the outer rim can be neglected, and the first
law gives

</p>
<p>The velocity at turbine inlet is related to mass flow by V1 = ṁρ1A1 , where A1
is the cross section of the chimney at point 1, and the pressure of the flow
remains constant, so that ρ1 = ρ0

</p>
<p>To avoid a detailed discussion of heat transfer mechanisms, we assume the
temperature T1 to be given, so that the above is an equation for the heat
supply from the sun, Q̇⊙. Note that due to emission and absorption of radi-
ation the temperature T1 is limited, as in a greenhouse. A proper radiation
heat transfer analysis must be performed to establish the size the glass roof
must have, so that the specified temperature T1 is reached.
</p>
<p>Next, we consider the flow between the turbine inlet (Point 1) and the
exhaust from the chimney (Point 2). We assume that turbine and chimney
are adiabatic, and, for simplicity, that the flow is reversible, so that it is
isentropic. The first law gives

<p>Accordingly, it is beneficial to build the tower as high as possible. For a height
of 200m the efficiency is η = 0.65% and this increases to η = 3.25% when
the height is raised to 1000m. Note that the thermal efficiency is very low
nevertheless. Here it must be considered that the main investment is to build
the plant, while the energy source&mdash;solar radiation&mdash;is available for free, as
long as no clouds are present, which is, of course, why one would build such
a solar tower power plant in a sunny country.

<p>Since the investment costs are high, one will aim to harvest as much power
as possible, which will be achieved by optimizing the operating conditions.

<p>In the past, the chimney effect was used for instance to drive the combus-
tion air for a coal power plant. As the above analysis shows, a well working
natural draught chimney requires a relatively high temperature (T1 = 2T0),
which implies discharge of large amounts of warm gas, and correspondingly
high entropy generation, and work loss. In modern power plants, and other
applications, discharge is effected by fans, which allow low exhaust temper-
atures. High chimneys are still build today, not to increase draught, but to
expel the exhaust into higher layers of the atmosphere for better dispersion
of the exhaust.

<p>13.9.1 Thrust and Propulsive Power
</p>
<p>While stationary turbines drive generators to produce electrical power, air-
craft turbines accelerate the incoming air flow to produce thrust, which is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.9 Aircraft Engines 311
</p>
<p>the force F to push the airplane. The engines are powered through the com-
bustion of a fuel.
</p>
<p>We consider an airplane moving with the velocity VA through environmen-
tal air. Due to the motion of the airplane, air is swept into the engine with
velocity VA and the engine accelerates the flow to the exhaust velocity VE
measured with respect to the engine. The temperature of the incoming air is
TA and the exhaust is at TE; inlet and exit pressure are just the environmental
pressure, but higher pressures occur inside the engine.
</p>
<p>A sketch of the flow through the engine is shown in Fig. 13.14, which also
indicates the fuel that is required to drive the engine; the working principle
of the engine is discussed later.

</p>
<p>According to Newton&rsquo;s second law, the thrust is the rate of change of
momentum of the air that passes the engine,
</p>
<p>F = ṁ (VE &minus; VA) . (13.25)
</p>
<p>Power is force times velocity, and thus the propulsive power provided by the
engine is the product of the force acting on the airplane, i.e., the thrust, and
the airplane velocity, that is
</p>
<p>ẆP = FVA = ṁ (VE &minus; VA)VA . (13.26)
</p>
<p>Before we look inside the engine to discuss its working principles, we take
a look at the engine as a whole from different points of view, in order to find
criteria for engine performance. Indeed, depending on the point of view of
the observer, the engine seems to be performing different tasks:
</p>
<p>For an observer resting with the engine, e.g., the pilot or a passenger, the
engine consumes fuel, and accelerates and heats air that passes through. This
is the frame of reference used in Fig. 13.14. For this observer the first law
reads

<p>Fig. 13.15 Airplane and engine as observed from the ground
</p>
<p>An observer on the ground, as depicted in Fig. 13.15, sees the airplane
flying with velocity VA through air which is at rest, and observes air expelled
from the engine with velocity (VE &minus; VA) and temperature TE . To obtain the
appropriate form of the first law for this observer we use the identity

</p>
<p>2
ṁ (VE &minus; VA)2 + ṁ (VE &minus; VA)VA = Q̇fuel . (13.29)

<p>We introduce the abbreviations
</p>
<p>Ėexkin =

</p>
<p>2
ṁ (VE &minus; VA)2 ,
</p>
<p>for the exhaust flow of kinetic energy, and
</p>
<p>Q̇H = ṁ (hE &minus; hA) (13.30)
</p>
<p>for the heating rate of the air passing through the engine, that is the amount
of heat required to heat the air isobarically from TA to TE . With these, and
the definition of propulsive power (13.26), the first law (13.29) assumes the
compact form
</p>
<p>Q̇H + Ė
ex
kin + ẆP = Q̇fuel . (13.31)
</p>
<p>This is the first law for the observer on the ground, who understands that
the heat Q̇fuel supplied through combustion of the fuel leads to three effects:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.9 Aircraft Engines 313
</p>
<p>(a) Propulsive power ẆP ; (b) Acceleration of environmental air, so that the
kinetic energy of exhaust is Ėexkin; (c) Heating Q̇H of the air to temperature
TE .
</p>
<p>Of course, both forms (13.27, 13.31) of the first law are equivalent, they
just differ by the point of view of the observer. However, the latter form is
better suited for evaluation of engine performance.
</p>
<p>Subsonic flight and supersonic flight have different aerodynamics, with
more propulsive power required in supersonic flows. To optimize speed and
efficiency, commercial airliners fly at about 80-90% of the speed of sound.
For military applications speed is essential, and many fighter planes fly at
supersonic speeds.
</p>
<p>13.9.2 Air Engine Efficiency
</p>
<p>The engine is build to deliver the propulsive power ẆP . Heating Q̇H and
acceleration Ėexkin are side effects which must be considered as losses. The ex-
haust leaving the engine at TE , VE &minus;VA has work potential (exergy) against
the environment as discussed in Sec. 11.6. Since there is no way to put the
exhaust to use after it is expelled from an engine in flight, it just equilibrates
with the surrounding air&mdash;this is an irreversible loss, i.e., an external irre-
versibility associated with the process. For efficient use of the fuel one must
diminish external losses, that is aim for processes with low exhaust exergy,
which means low exhaust temperature TE and low exhaust velocity VE &minus;VA.
We also note that low exit velocities diminish engine noise significantly.
</p>
<p>The obvious measure for engine performance is the thermal efficiency for
propulsion, defined as
</p>
<p>ηP =
ẆP
</p>
<p>Q̇fuel
=
</p>
<p>ẆP
</p>
<p>Q̇H + Ėexkin + ẆP
, (13.32)
</p>
<p>where the first law (13.29) was used. For fixed value of ẆP the thermal
efficiency of propulsion grows, when heating Q̇H and exhaust kinetic energy
Ėexkin become smaller.
</p>
<p>A common measure from fluid dynamics for propulsive efficiency is the
Froude propulsive efficiency (William Froude, 1810-1879) ηF which asks how
much of the gain in kinetic energy produced in the engine, as seen from the
observer resting with the engine, is actually converted to propulsive power,
that is
</p>
<p>ηF =
ẆP
</p>
<p>ṁ
(
</p>
<p>1

</p>
<p>) =
ẆP
</p>
<p>ẆP + Eexkin
=
</p>
<p>2VA
VA + VE
</p>
<p>. (13.33)
</p>
<p>The Froude efficiency is a purely mechanical measure, other than the ther-
mal efficiency ηP it does not account for the loss through expulsion of hot</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>314 13 Gas Engines
</p>
<p>exhaust. The Froude efficiency approaches unity when the outflow velocity
VE approaches the inflow velocity VA.
</p>
<p>For a certain airplane, the required propulsive power ẆP and flight velocity
VA are given, while inflow temperature TA and inflow pressure pA depend on
the local condition of the air the airplane is flying through. Both efficiencies,
ηF and ηP , show that an efficient engine for the airplane will have a small
increase in velocity (VE &minus; VA), but a large mass flow ṁ, so that ẆP =
ṁ (VE &minus; VA)VA has the required value. Moreover, to keep the thermal loss
small, the exhaust temperature should be as low as possible.
</p>
<p>13.9.3 Turbojet Engine
</p>
<p>Standard air turbines operate similar to stationary gas turbines for power
generation. While in the latter the turbine serves to drive the compressor
and the generator, an air engine has a smaller turbine, which only serves to
drive the compressor. After the turbine, the still hot and compressed air is
expanded in a nozzle to accelerate the flow to VE .

(1-2), compressor (2-3), combustion chamber (3-4), turbine (4-5) and nozzle (5-6)
</p>
<p>Figure 13.16 shows a schematic and the T-s-diagram for a simple standard
air turbine, i.e., a turbojet engine, consisting of diffuser, compressor, com-
bustion chamber, turbine and nozzle. The diffuser decelerates the inflow to
increase the pressure, thus lowering the work required for compression. The
turbine is used solely to drive the compressor, the work for both is equal,
with different sign. The hot pressurized combustion product is expanded and
accelerated in the nozzle. Since the throughput is fast, there is no time to
exchange heat, and diffuser, compressor, turbine and nozzle are considered
to be adiabatic.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.9 Aircraft Engines 315
</p>
<p>For the discussion of air engines we shall rely, again, on the air standard
analysis, that is we ignore any composition changes and treat the working
fluid as air. The standard air turbine operates on the following cycle
</p>
<p>1-2 adiabatic diffuser: h2 = h1 +

</p>
<p>2-3 adiabatic compressor: wC = h2 &minus; h3 ,

<p>Again, we consider the ideal process under cold-air approximation (constant
specific heat) to get insight into the parameters that determine performance.
Inlet conditions T1, p1, VA are given; compressor pressure ratio PC = p3p2
and turbine inlet temperature T4 are design parameters for the engine. For
reversible processes, we find the following relations between the properties at
the corner points of the process:

and propulsive power wP grow slower. Thus, increase of the turbine inlet
temperature increases propulsive power, but reduces the propulsive thermal
efficiency ηP = wp/qin, due to larger external irreversibilities.</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>316 13 Gas Engines
</p>
<p>From the above follows that engines with high pressure ratio and large
turbine inlet temperatures provide large propulsive power. If one is interested
mainly in power, and efficiency has lower importance, one will run a engine
under these conditions. However, fuel cost is significant, and directly related
to efficiency. Most of today&rsquo;s jet engines are high bypass turbofan engines,
which are far more efficient, as will be discussed in Sec. 13.9.5.
</p>
<p>Standard turbojet engines, or turbofan engines with low bypass ratio, are
employed for supersonic propulsion, mostly for military applications. In af-
terburner engines additional boost is obtained by injecting fuel into the hot
nozzle flow, where it burns, and further heats the flow, and thus gives even
higher nozzle exit velocities.
</p>
<p>13.9.4 Example: Turbojet Engine
</p>
<p>An airplane cruises with a velocity VA = 300 ms at about 9000m altitude
where the local pressure and temperature are p1 = 32 kPa and T1 = 241K.
The compressor pressure ratio is P = 12, and the turbine inlet temperature is
1400K. We assume isentropic efficiencies of 80% for compressor and turbine,
and 95% for diffuser and nozzle, and compute the velocity and temperature
of the exhaust gas, propulsive power for a mass flow of ṁ = 50 kgs , thermal
and Froude efficiencies, and the work potential of the exhaust. The working
fluid is air, as ideal gas with variable specific heats. The process is as shown
in Fig. 13.16, with irreversible subprocesses. We go through the processes
step by step, all numerical values will be entered into a table that is found
further below.
</p>
<p>Diffuser (1-2): The first law gives h2 = h (T2) = h1 +
1
2V2A which de-
</p>
<p>termines T2. The pressure after an isentropic diffuser that reaches T2 is
</p>
<p>obtained as p2s = p1
pr(T2)
pr(T1)
</p>
<p>; however, this is not the pressure after the
</p>
<p>irreversible diffuser. The isentropic efficiency of the diffuser ηD =
hx&minus;h1
h2&minus;h1
</p>
<p>defines the fictitious temperature Tx that would be obtained by isentropic
compression to the actual pressure p2 for the irreversible compressor. We
find hx = h (Tx) = h1 + ηD (h2 &minus; h1), and hence Tx. With that, the pressure
after the diffuser is p2 = px = p1
</p>
<p>pr(Tx)
pr(T1)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Compressor (2-3): The exit pressure of the compressor is p3 = p2P .
Moreover, we find T3s from pr (T3) = pr (T2)P , and then h3 and T3 fol-
low from the isentropic compressor efficiency as h3 = h (T3) = h2 +
(h3s &minus; h2) /ηC .
</p>
<p>Heating (3-4): As always, the combustion chamber is assumed to be
isobaric, p4 = p3; the temperature T4 is given.
</p>
<p>Turbine (4-5): The turbine is required to drive the compressor, that
is wT = &minus;wC , or h4 &minus; h5 = h3 &minus; h2 from which we find h5 and then T5. A
reversible turbine expanding to the same pressure p5 would end with enthalpy
h5s = h4 + (h5 &minus; h4) /ηT which follows from the definition of the isentropic</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.9 Aircraft Engines 317

<p>turbine efficiency ηT . The pressure finally is obtained from the isentropic
</p>
<p>relation between points 4 and 5s, p5 = p5s = p4
pr(T5s)
pr(T4)
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Nozzle (5-6): The nozzle expands the turbine exhaust to the environ-
mental pressure p6 = p1. An isentropic nozzle would give the turbine exit
temperature T6s, and thus the enthalpy h6s = h (T6s), which follow from
pr (T6s) = pr (T5)
</p>
<p>p6
p5
. Exit enthalpy, and temperature, follow from the isen-
</p>
<p>tropic nozzle efficiency ηN , one finds h6 = h5 + (h6s &minus; h5) ηN . The nozzle
exit velocity is V6 =

</p>
<p>Almost half of the loss (9.12MW) is due to kinetic energy losses, the re-
mainder is due to thermal losses. Altogether, the external work loss is more
than twice the actual propulsive power produced. Both must be reduced to
improve engine efficiency.
</p>
<p>13.9.5 Bypass Turbofan Engine
</p>
<p>The general discussion of air engine efficiency has shown that engines with
relatively slow and cold exhaust are more efficient. Since propulsive power is
given as ẆP = ṁ (VE &minus; VA)VA, lower exit velocity VE must be compensated
by larger mass flow, to generate the desired power. Bypass turbofan engines
have smaller exit velocities, increased mass flow, and also smaller (average)
exit temperature, and thus have small external losses, and high efficiency.

<p>Fig. 13.17 Bypass turbofan engine with fan, compressor, combustion chamber,
turbine and nozzle. The fan forces air through the bypass, where it is accelerated
</p>
<p>In a turbofan engine, sketched in Fig. 13.17, an additional turbine stage
is added to drive the fan. The fan forces air through a duct outside the
engine core, called the bypass, where the air is accelerated to velocity VB.
The incoming mass flux ṁ is split into two streams, the bypass stream ṁB
and the core stream ṁC . Only the core stream runs through compressor,
combustion chamber, turbine and nozzle. The bypass flow is not heated; this
lowers the exhaust temperature and improves efficiency.
</p>
<p>This arrangement increases the mass flow through the engine and decreases
the outflow velocity and temperature, and thus allows to produce propulsive
power at higher efficiency. The bypass ratio is defined as the ratio of the inlet
cross sections of core and bypass, MB =
</p>
<p>AB
AC
</p>
<p>= ṁBṁC , and we expect better
efficiency for larger bypass ratio. The fan is particularly important at take-off,
where the power demand is high, but the airplane speed VA is low.
</p>
<p>Again, we study the ideal process under cold-air standard conditions. The
power demand for the adiabatic fan follows from the first law. For the ideal
process, we have isentropic compression by the fan followed by isentropic
expansion in the duct. Inlet and exit pressures agree, as do the respective</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.9 Aircraft Engines 319
</p>
<p>entropies, and thus the exit temperature equals the inlet temperature. Hence,
the fan work is just the difference in kinetic energy for the bypass flow,

<p>For irreversible fan and duct, the exit temperature would be slightly higher,

</p>
<p>The processes in the core are the same as for the standard turbine, but now
we use the numbering as in Fig. 13.17. As long as all processes are ideal, the
evaluation is easiest when we begin with the first law balanced over the total
core, between states 1 and 5. The turbine work is used to drive the compressor
and the fan, but since turbine and compressor are within the control volume,
only the fan work appears in the first law, which reads6

</p>
<p>The optimized values computed above from simplifying assumptions (cold
air, air standard, reversible processes, same exit velocity for bypass and core
flows) are not too far from those encountered in state-of the art turbofan
engines. These engines are quite complex, with 2 or 3 turbine-compressor
and turbine-fan pairs running on concentric shafts, and sometimes gears, so
that high and low pressure turbines and compressors, and the fan run at
optimal rotational speeds.
</p>
<p>Noise reduction is an important task in commercial aircraft. Engine noise is
high when engine exit flows are supersonic, hence real-life engines must be con-
structed to have subsonic exit velocities. From the above discussion it is evident
that turbofans allow low exit velocities, and hence relatively silent operation.7
</p>
<p>7 The above optimization of the bypass engine relied on several simplifying as-
sumptions (cold air standard, all processes reversible) which leads to somewhat
inaccurate results. Hence, there is no value in including the requirement for sub-
sonic outflow into the arguments.</p>

<p>In propjet engines, fan and bypass are replaced by a propeller, which pro-
vides all thrust, the turbine expands to the environmental pressure and pro-

while turbofan engines can operate at subsonic and supersonic flight speeds.

<p>Compressible Flow: Nozzles and
Diffusers
</p>
<p>14.1 Sub- and Supersonic Flows
</p>
<p>Gas flows through nozzles and diffusers show an interesting behavior when
their speed reaches, or is above, the speed of sound of the gas. This behavior
must be well understood for the proper design of devices and engines. In this
section we study the laws that govern the transition from sub- to supersonic
flow and vice-versa, and draw relevant conclusions for the design of nozzles
and diffusers, and for rocket motors. We will see that subsonic nozzles have a
converging cross section, while supersonic nozzles have a converging-diverging
cross section.
</p>
<p>14.2 Speed of Sound
</p>
<p>The ear reacts to small pressure oscillations,1 that is sound is a pressure
wave. The speed of sound is the speed with which such a small pressure
disturbance travels through a medium. To compute its value, we consider a
simple experiment, shown in Fig. 14.1 (left): In a long pipe, a wave is created
by a small push of a piston. This wave travels through the pipe with the
speed of sound, a.
</p>
<p>To analyze the wave, and to compute the speed of sound, it is best to
consider the wavefront from a co-moving frame, as depicted on the right of
the figure. The wave travels into undisturbed fluid with properties p, ρ, h, s,
and the observer travelling with the wave sees fluid coming in at the speed
of sound a. The fluid left behind by the wave has slightly altered properties
p + dp, ρ + dρ, h + dh, s + ds, and the observer on the wave sees it leaving
with speed a&minus; dV .
</p>
<p>Since the wave travels fast, there is no time for heat exchange, thus we can
assume that the wave is adiabatic. Moreover, we shall ignore irreversibilities
through friction, that is we consider reversible wave propagation.

</p>
<p>Indeed, sound waves in air are only very weakly damped. That we hear
noises from far away only weakly is due to the spherical propagation of sound
waves, where the sound energy is distributed over shells of surface 4πR2 when
R is the distance from the sound source. Thus local sound energy, which is
what we hear, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the
source, that is proportional to 1/R2. In a pipe, however, the propagation is
one-dimensional, waves travel as plane waves with unchanged wave surface
area, which is equal to the pipe cross section.
</p>
<p>Applying the mass balance to the wave front yields
</p>
<p>ṁ = ρAV = const. (14.1)
</p>
<p>Since the cross section A does not change, this yields
</p>
<p>(ρ+ dρ) (a&minus; dV) = ρa . (14.2)

<p>The changes dV and dρ are so small that their product can be ignored, so

<p>Keep in mind that k depends on temperature: For air (R = 0.287 kJkgK ) at
T = 298 we have k = 1.4 and thus a = 346 ms , while at T = 1200K we have

<p>14.4 Area-Velocity Relation
</p>
<p>The main design parameter for nozzles and diffusers is the change of cross
section, and we ask how flow properties, in particular velocity and pressure,
change with the cross section. Figure 14.2 shows an adiabatic and reversible,
i.e., isentropic, flow through a duct with varying cross section. We consider
a small slice of the duct of width dx, and apply the balances of mass, energy
and entropy, similar to what we did for the wave in the pipe above.

<p>Accordingly, a change of cross section has different effect when applied to

<p>pressure grows, and the flow decelerates; this is a diffuser.

flow, but as a nozzle in supersonic flow. Figure 14.3 shows a summary.

</p>
<p>14.5 Nozzle Flows
</p>
<p>Rocket motors and some jet engines expel supersonic flows for propulsion,
and thus need appropriate nozzle geometries. To accelerate a subsonic flow
to supersonic speed requires a converging-diverging nozzle, where the flow
is accelerated to sonic speed in the converging part, and then to supersonic
speed in the diverging part. After its inventor Gustaf de Laval (1845-1913),
such a nozzle is called Laval nozzle.
</p>
<p>We will almost exclusively deal with isentropic flows. So that we can per-
form analytical calculations, we restrict the treatment to ideal gases with
constant specific heats. We shall discuss flows through purely converging noz-
zles, and through converging-diverging nozzles. In both cases, the balances
of mass, energy and entropy reduce to

<p>and this relation will be used now to understand converging and converging-
diverging nozzle flows. For this, we study the outflow from a large container
into a nozzle, where the gas in the container is in the constant stagnation state
(T0, p0). The flow is driven by the difference between the back pressure outside
the nozzle, pb, and the stagnation pressure p0, as indicated in Fig. 14.5. No
flow occurs when pb = p0, and we now study what happens when pb is lowered
gradually.
</p>
<p>14.6 Converging Nozzle
</p>
<p>As the back pressure pb is lowered a bit, the flow develops. The cross section
A is decreasing along the nozzle coordinate x, see Fig. 14.6. According to
Fig. 14.4, the flow function is hill-shaped, and the nozzle feed state is on
</p>
<p>the right foot of that hill, at p = p0, ψ = 0. Since Aψ

<p>decreasing cross section A the flow function must grow, i.e., go uphill. The
flow function grows along x, and reaches its largest value in the smallest cross
section Ath, the throat of the nozzle, which is at the end of the converging
nozzle. As ψ grows along the nozzle coordinate, the pressure decreases, until
it assumes the pressure pe = pb in the end cross section of the nozzle. Further
decrease of the back pressure leads to lower pressures along the nozzle, and
larger values of the flow function.
</p>
<p>When the back pressure pb assumes the critical value p
&lowast;, the flow function
</p>
<p>in the exit is at its maximum ψ&lowast;. No further growth of ψ is possible when
the back pressure is lowered further. Thus, the exit state remains at ψe = ψ
</p>

</p>
<p>and pe = p

<p>where Ath is the cross section at the nozzle end. No further increase of the
mass flow through the nozzle is possible. To understand this behavior, we
determine temperature and velocity in the exit at choked conditions. From
the adiabatic relation and (14.26, 14.29) we find

</p>
<p>Thus, for choked flow, the exit speed is just the local speed of sound, a&lowast;. We
recall that the speed of sound is the velocity of a pressure disturbance. When
the back pressure is lowered, the information on the pressure change travels
with the speed of sound relative to the gas. Since the gas leaves with just the
same speed, the information on pressure change is not transmitted into the
nozzle, and no changes can occur inside, the exit velocity and the mass flow
are limited.
</p>
<p>With pb &lt; p
&lowast;, a pressure discontinuity occurs at the nozzle exit, which
</p>
<p>contributes to thrust for the airplane or rocket. The exhaust expands outside
the nozzle to the back pressure, and accelerates, and this expansion is some-
what irreversible, more so with bigger pressure differences.2 Most commercial
airplanes have converging nozzles and subsonic outflow, to reduce noise.
</p>
<p>14.7 Example: Safety Valve
</p>
<p>The mass flow limitation must be considered for the design of safety valves.
As an example we consider a steam boiler that produces 10t/ h of saturated
vapor at p0 = 15 bar (so that T0 = 471K). In case of emergency, all steam
produced must be discharged through a safety valve. We compute the mini-
mum cross section the valve can have under the assumption that the steam
can be described as an ideal gas with constant specific heats and k = 1.135.
Solving (14.31) for the cross section gives, with the ideal gas law p0 = ρ0RT0,

<p>2 In the discussion of jet engines we have considered adiabatic expansion to the
back pressure, which, for pb &lt; p
</p>
<p>&lowast;, is only possible in Laval nozzles as discussed
below. This simplification ignores the external expansion; however, the associated
irrversibilities can be included into the nozzle efficiency. A full discussion of the
exterior expansion, and the related thrust is beyond the scope of this book.</p>

</p>
<p>To reach exit velocities above the speed of sound requires converging-
diverging nozzles, which will be discussed next. The cross section A is first
decreasing until is reaches its smallest value Ath in the throat of the noz-
zle, and then it is increasing to the exit cross section Ae. Again we consider
the pressure distribution in the nozzle which results from lowering the back
pressure pb, see Fig. 14.7.

depend on the back pressure as discussed in the text.
</p>
<p>When pb = p0, there is no flow and homogenous pressure p0 throughout the
nozzle. When the back pressure is lowered somewhat, a flow occurs. According
to Fig. 14.4, the flow function is hill-shaped, and the nozzle feed state is on
</p>
<p>the right foot of that hill, at p = p0, ψ = 0. Since Aψ
(
</p>
<p>p
p0
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>is constant, the
</p>
<p>flow function must grow&mdash;go uphill&mdash;in the converging part of the nozzle,
and it must decrease&mdash;go downhill&mdash;in the diverging part.
</p>
<p>We first consider relatively large back pressures in the pressure range p1 &lt;
pb &lt; p0 in the figure. As the nozzle converges, the flow state climbs uphill
until a value pth &gt; p
</p>
<p>&lowast;, ψth &lt; ψ
&lowast; is reached in the throat. This point is
</p>
<p>to the right of the maximum. As the cross section grows in the diverging
part, the flow function must decrease, and this is only possible by returning
to higher pressures, that is by going back downhill towards the right. The
flow is accelerated in the converging part of the nozzle, and decelerated in
the diverging part, the outflow velocity is relatively low, and subsonic. The
extreme case of this flow type is reached for pb = p1, when the air is in the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>338 14 Compressible Flow: Nozzles and Diffusers
</p>
<p>critical state in the throat&mdash;on top of the hill with sonic speed&mdash;but then is
decelerated again.
</p>
<p>When the flow reaches the critical state in the throat, the flow function
can decrease by going down the left side of the hill, towards lower pressures,
and higher, i.e., supersonic, velocities. As indicated in the figure, this requires
low back pressures p2 &lt; pb &le; 0. In this range the flow is isentropic inside
the nozzle. If the back pressure is just at p3, the end pressure is equal to
the back pressure, and no external irreversibilities occur. If the back pressure
is in the range p2 &lt; pb &lt; p3, the end pressure is below the back pressure
and pressure is equilibrated through oblique shocks outside the nozzle. For
lower back pressures pb &lt; p3, the end pressure is above the back pressure and
pressure is equilibrated through external expansion waves.

<p>In the range p2 &lt; pb &lt; p1, isentropic flow inside the nozzle is not possi-
ble. The flow will follow isentropic flow conditions for a while, accelerating
to supersonic flow behind the throat, and then a irreversible normal shock
will occur, that is a sudden jump from low pressure supersonic flow to high
pressure subsonic flow. Behind the shock, the flow will be isentropic again,
and the gas will expand to the back pressure.
</p>
<p>We shall not further discuss normal and oblique shocks, but stress that
they are strongly irreversible, and thus reduce nozzle efficiency substantially.
In a shock, the flow changes from supersonic to subsonic, which means signif-
icant reduction of thrust. Nozzle geometry must be carefully designed so that
the flow conditions are optimal. Some supersonic aircraft have nozzles with
variable geometry, to adjust for the wide range of back pressures encountered
between take-off and high altitude flight.

<p>14.9 Rockets, Ramjet and Scramjet
</p>
<p>Jet engines are air-breathing, that is they carry the fuel on board, and burn
it with oxygen from the ambient air that passes through the engine. Rockets
carry the oxygen on board, either as liquefied oxygen, or in the form of
a compound. Thus, rockets are independent of ambient air, and can fly at
extremely high altitude, and in space. In a rocket motor, fuel and oxidizer are
burnt at high pressure in the combustion chamber and then expand through
a Laval nozzle, which provides large supersonic exit velocities, and thus large
thrust, see Fig. 14.8.
</p>
<p>The oxygen a rocket has to carry on board increases the take-off weight,
and reduces the payload that can be carried along. Some military applications
require fast transport of payload through the atmosphere,3 and rockets are
used because they offer extremely high velocities.
</p>
<p>Ramjet and scramjet are conceptually simple air-breathing engines for su-
personic flight, hence they do not require to carry the heavy oxidizer on board.

<p>In both pressure build-up in the engine is affected only through diffusers, see
Fig. 14.9 for sketches.
</p>
<p>In a ramjet, the incoming air is slowed down to subsonic speed and high
pressure by means of a converging-diverging diffuser, which operates on the
same principles as a Laval nozzle, only inversely. Fuel is injected into the com-
pressed air and burned, the hot combustion product then expands through
a Laval nozzle to high velocities. Ramjets can be used for supersonic flight
with speeds up to Ma = 6.
</p>
<p>In a scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet), the flow stays supersonic at
all times. A supersonic diffuser slows down the flow and pressure increases.
Fuel is injected into the flow and burned, and the hot pressurized combustion
product leaves through a supersonic nozzle. Flight speeds could be up to
Ma = 15 or so. Due to the high air velocity at the burner, it is quite difficult
to maintain stable combustion of the fuel. To get the scramjet engine started
it must be accelerated to supersonic speed first, so that the converging diffuser
leads to pressure build-up.

</p>
<p>14.10 Example: Ramjet
</p>
<p>A ramjet is to fly at MaI = 3 in high altitude, where the temperature is
TI = 200K and the pressure is pI = 0.3 bar. The diffuser inlet, diffuser
outlet, and nozzle inlet all have the cross section AR = 0.1m
</p>
<p>2. We determine
the throat cross sections of diffuser and nozzle, and the nozzle exit cross
section for the case that the nozzle expands isentropically to the outside
pressure. Moreover, we will compute exit velocity, thrust, and propulsive
power. To simplify proceedings, we consider the working gas air as ideal gas
with constant specific heats, R = 0.287 kJkgK , k = 1.4, cp =

</p>
<p>To be able to use the equations for nozzles, which also hold for diffusers, we
first need to determine the stagnation state for the diffuser. The stagnation
temperature TD0 follows from the first law (adiabatic deceleration), and the
corresponding stagnation pressure pD0 follows from the isentropic relation

<p>Transient and Inhomogeneous
Processes in Open Systems
</p>
<p>15.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>So far, we have considered steady state processes in open systems, and time
dependent processes in closed systems. In this chapter, to widen the scope a
bit, we show some simple applications of space dependent and time dependent
open systems.
</p>
<p>The full discussion of inhomogeneous processes, steady state or transient,
requires the solution of the partial differential equations of hydrodynamics,
e.g., the Navier-Stokes equations and Fourier&rsquo;s law of heat conduction. The
derivation of the transport equations is the subject of Non-equilibrium Ther-
modynamics, and their solution is a question of mathematics and numeri-
cal methods. Fluid Dynamics, and Heat and Mass Transfer are disciplines
which rely heavily on the study of solutions of the appropriate transport
equations.
</p>
<p>Below, we first discuss one-dimensional co- and counter-flow heat exchang-
ers as a simple application of inhomogeneous systems. Then, as a relatively
easy application of open time-dependent systems, we consider filling and dis-
charge processes, e.g., of gas bottles, rooms, or cavities, as long as the content
can be assumed to have homogeneous properties.
</p>
<p>15.2 Heat Exchangers
</p>
<p>15.2.1 Basic Equations
</p>
<p>We discuss the principles of simple heat exchange between two flows, which
are either running in the same direction (co-flow), or in opposite directions
(counter-flow), see Fig. 15.1 for a basic sketch of the set-up. Heat exchange is
assumed to be a one-dimensional process, where the temperatures TA (x) and
TB (x) of the two flows depend only on the space coordinate in flow direction,

</p>
<p>Heat is transferred between the two flows due to different temperatures
TA (x) and TB (x). Typically, the inflow temperatures of the flows are given,
and one aims at determining the outflow temperatures.
</p>
<p>Since the temperatures depend on the location x, we need to balance
energy for each location. Figure 15.2 shows small elements of infinitesimal
width dx and the corresponding flows and properties for co- and counter-flow
settings.

<p>where in the second equation the upper sign refers to co-flow, and the lower
sign refers to counter-flow. The heat exchange between the flows within the
element dx is denoted by δQ̇, and is given by Newton&rsquo;s law of cooling (4.35),
which we write here as
</p>
<p>δQ̇ = α (TA &minus; TB) dx . (15.2)
</p>
<p>Heat transfer is proportional to the contact area bdx. In the above, the width
b is absorbed into the coefficient α and only the length dx of the element is
made explicit. The heat transfer coefficient α will be assumed to be constant.

<p>15.2.2 Co-flow Heat Exchangers
</p>
<p>We consider co-flow heat exchangers (upper sign) first. The known inflow
conditions are the temperatures TA (0) and TB (0), for which we find from

<p>α̂A + α̂B

</p>
<p>Solving this for the constants K1 and K2 and inserting these into (15.6) gives
the temperature curves for the co-flow heat exchanger as
</p>
<p>TA (x) =
TA (0) +

&minus; TA (0)&minus; TB (0)
</p>
<p>1 + α̂Aα̂B
exp [&minus; (α̂A + α̂B)x] .
</p>
<p>According to these equations, the two temperatures approach a common value
exponentially. The common value is obtained in the limit x &rarr; &infin; as

TB (L) differ from this value, see Fig. 15.3.

</p>
<p>The entropy generation is a useful measure for the work loss associated
with the heat exchanger. Since we consider the heat exchanger to be adiabatic
to the outside, the entropy generation is just the difference between entropy
flowing in and out; for simple incompressible fluids it is computed as
</p>
<p>Ṡgen = ṁAc
A
p ln
</p>
<p>TA (L)
</p>
<p>TA (0)
+ ṁBc
</p>
<p>B
p ln
</p>
<p>TB (L)
</p>
<p>TB (0)
. (15.10)
</p>
<p>In a co-flow heat exchanger, all heat transfer takes places over finite tempera-
ture differences and the entropy generation is always finite. Therefore co-flow
heat exchangers always have an associated work loss.
</p>
<p>15.2.3 Counter-Flow Heat Exchangers
</p>
<p>Now we consider counter-flow heat exchangers (lower sign). The known inflow
conditions are the temperatures TA (0) and TB (L), for which we find from
(15.6)
</p>
<p>TA (0) = K2 +
α̂A
</p>
<p>α̂A &minus; α̂B
K1 ,
</p>
<p>(15.11)
</p>
<p>TB (L) =
α̂B
α̂A
</p>
<p>K2 exp [&minus; (α̂A &minus; α̂B)L] +
α̂A
</p>
<p>α̂A &minus; α̂B
K1 .
</p>
<p>Solving this for the constants K1 and K2 and inserting these into (15.6) gives
the temperature curves for the counter-flow heat exchanger as
</p>
<p>TA (x) = TA (0) + [TB (L)&minus; TA (0)]
exp [(α̂B &minus; α̂A) x]&minus; 1
</p>
<p>α̂B
α̂A
</p>
<p>exp [(α̂B &minus; α̂A)L]&minus; 1
,
</p>
<p>(15.12)
</p>
<p>TB (x) = TB (L) + [TB (L)&minus; TA (0)]
exp [(α̂B &minus; α̂A)x]&minus; exp [(α̂B &minus; α̂A)L]
</p>
<p>exp [(α̂B &minus; α̂A)L]&minus; α̂Aα̂B
.
</p>
<p>This solution becomes singular for the special case α̂A = α̂B = α̂. L&rsquo;Hôpital&rsquo;s
rule must be used to find the temperature curves for this case as
</p>
<p>TA (x) = TA (0) + [TB (L)&minus; TA (0)]
α̂x
</p>
<p>1 + α̂L
, (15.13)
</p>
<p>TB (x) = TB (L) + [TB (L)&minus; TA (0)]
α̂ (x&minus; L)
1 + α̂L
</p>
<p>. (15.14)
</p>
<p>Thus, in general, we will observe exponential curves for the temperatures, but
straight lines in the case that α̂A = α̂B. Figure 15.4 shows the temperature
curves for three cases with different or equal values of α̂A and α̂B.</p>

<p>Thus, stream A exits in equilibrium with stream B at x = L&infin;, but stream

α̂B &gt; α̂, the behavior is opposite. The only case where both exiting streams

<p>15.2.4 Summary
</p>
<p>In an infinitely long counter-flow heat exchanger running at optimum con-
dition α̂Aα̂B = 1, both streams have the same temperatures at all locations
(with an infinitesimal difference for heat transfer, of course), and no entropy
is generated. In co-flow heat exchangers, the entropy generation is always
non-zero, since the temperature difference at the common inlet is given by
the temperatures of the incoming streams.
</p>
<p>Realistic heat exchangers have finite length, and thus some generation of
entropy, which is always less in counter-flow heat exchangers as compared
to co-flow systems. In the latter, both flows approach an intermediate tem-
perature, while in the counter-flow case, the flows approach an exchange of
their temperatures: the exit temperature of one flow is close to the inlet
temperature of the other. This certainly is the more desirable outcome.
</p>
<p>Entropy generation arguments should be used in the design of heat ex-
changers, which should be build such that the overall entropy generation in
the heat exchanger is as small as possible.

<p>15.3 Heating of a House
</p>
<p>As first example for transient processes in open systems, we study the heat-
ing of a house in a simplified model. The house of volume V0 is initially in
equilibrium with the outside environment at p0, T0. To elevate the temper-
ature in the house to a pleasant value TH , the house is heated at constant
rate Q̇heat. Heat transfer through the walls leads to heat loss Q̇loss to the
outside. Moreover, the house exchanges air through gaps in doors, windows</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.3 Heating of a House 353
</p>
<p>and walls, and we assume that the pressure stays constant at all times. We
ask for the amount of heat that must be supplied to keep the house at the
inside temperature TH , and for the time required to heat the house to that
temperature.
</p>
<p>The house consists of the mass mS of structural material (wood, stone,
concrete, plaster, . . . ), which has the average specific heat cS . To simplify the
calculation, we shall assume that the whole structure is at the temperature
T (t), that is we ignore any inhomogeneous temperature distribution in the
outside walls, which, in reality, would be colder further outside. The mass of
air in the house is denoted as ṁA (t) and is subject to change due to inflow
or outflow through gaps.
</p>
<p>The mass and energy balances for the house read
</p>
<p>dmA
dt
</p>
<p>= &minus;ṁA ,
dU
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇heat &minus; αA (T &minus; T0)&minus; ṁAhA , (15.20)
</p>
<p>where α is the heat transfer coefficient for the house, U is the total internal
energy (air and structure) and A is the outside surface. Kinetic and potential
energies are ignored, and the house and air have the homogeneous tempera-
ture T . The last term in the energy balance, ṁAhA, is the convective outflow
of energy. As long as the house is heated, we expect only outflow, due to iso-
baric expansion of the inside air. In cooling of the house, say at night when
the heating is switched off, the air contracts, and outside air (at h0) flows in.
</p>
<p>Before we consider the time dependent process, we have a look at the final
steady state, for which dmAdt =
</p>
<p>dU
dt = 0 and T = TH , so that the final house
</p>
<p>temperature is obtained as
</p>
<p>TH = T0 +
Q̇heat
αA
</p>
<p>. (15.21)
</p>
<p>This relation shows that the house temperature is controlled through adjust-
ment of the heating rate Q̇heat. Improved insulation reduces the heat transfer
coefficient α and thus the heat requirement Q̇heat.
</p>
<p>With suitable choice of the energy constants, the internal energy of the
house and the enthalpy of the air are
</p>
<p>U = (mScS +mAcv)T , h = u+RT = cpT , (15.22)
</p>
<p>where cv and cp = cv+R are the specific heats of air, assumed to be constant.
The mass of air in the house follows from the ideal gas law as
</p>
<p>mA =
p0V0
RT
</p>
<p>. (15.23)
</p>
<p>Combining the above, including eliminating the air mass by means of (15.23),
yields a differential equation for temperature, which after some simplifications
reads</p>

the evolution of the inside temperature T towards TH over time t, in an
implicit way. The first term on the left hand side describes the heating of the
air, and the second term describes the heating of the structure.
</p>
<p>We consider a small house with a footprint of 10m&times; 10m, a height of 3m
and a flat roof. The air volume of the house is approximately 300m3 which
at final conditions (TH , p0) corresponds to a mass of mH =
</p>
<p>p0V0
RTH
</p>
<p>= 350 kg.
Clearly, this mass, and the corresponding heat capacity mHcp, is much less
than mass mS and heat capacity mScS of the structure.
</p>
<p>If we completely ignore the contribution to air heating, we obtain for the
temperature an exponential relation,
</p>
<p>T = T0 + (TH &minus; T0)

])
</p>
<p>, (15.28)
</p>
<p>where we have used (15.21).
In a house, normally first the air is heated, e.g., by radiators or forced air
</p>
<p>heating, and then heat is transferred from the warm air to the structure. If
heat transfer to the structure is slow, the structure heating can be ignored,
and the air temperature approaches the final temperature according to

</p>
<p>The approach to the final temperature is determined by the time constants
αA

<p>cSmS
and αAcpmA , respectively. Due to the large differences in mass between

<p>air and structure, the air heats up much faster than the structure.
</p>
<p>15.4 Reversible Filling of an Adiabatic Container
</p>
<p>When one inflates a bicycle tire with a hand pump, tire and pump become
warm. While some of the heat comes from friction in the pump&mdash;no seal is
friction free&mdash;a large part of the heat is due to the rise of temperature of the
air being compressed.
</p>
<p>To fix ideas we consider the simplest possible case, namely the filling of an
adiabatic container with an ideal gas under the assumption that all processes
are fully reversible. The system to be considered consists of the adiabatic
container of volume V0 and an adiabatic reversible compressor which draws
outside air at T0, p0 and compresses it to the pressure p inside the container,
which grows over time. Figure 15.6 gives a sketch of the system considered.

<p>where Ẇ is the power to run the compressor, and ṁ is the mass flow pushed
into the container. There is no generation of entropy due to the assumption
of reversibility. We assume that initially the container is in equilibrium with
the environment, so that it contains the mass m0 =
</p>
<p>p0V0

</p>
<p>, and that the mass
flow has the same value at all times, i.e., ṁ = const. Integration of the mass
balance gives the mass in the container at time t as</p>

<p>The entropy balance can be integrated easily, to give
</p>
<p>S = ṁs0t+ S0 , (15.32)
</p>
<p>where S0 = m0s0 is the entropy of the initial filling, and S = ms is the
entropy at time t. Combining the last two equations we find
</p>
<p>S = ms = ṁs0t+m0s0 = ms0 . (15.33)
</p>
<p>Therefore the specific entropy of the gas stays constant,

<p>The air inside the container is compressed adiabatically, as is the intake air

<p>15.5 Reversible Discharge from an Adiabatic
Container
</p>
<p>In the previous section we filled a container with compressed air. Expansion
of the compressed air yields work. Thus, compressing air into a container can
be used as a means to store energy. The reversible work potential of the air in
the filled container is the closed system exergy of the compressed air (11.31),
</p>
<p>Ξ = m (u&minus; uE) + pE (V &minus; VE)&minus; TEm (s&minus; sE) . (15.40)
</p>
<p>For the evaluation we must consider the appearing quantities with some
care: V is the system volume, which for the present notation is the container
volume V0, while VE =
</p>
<p>mRTE
pE
</p>
<p>is the volume of the system when expanded
to environmental pressure and temperature pE = p0, TE = T0. Note that,
due to the reversible adiabatic filling process considered, s = s0 = sE . With
this, and the filling state m = nm0, T , p, as given above, the exergy of the
compressed air becomes
</p>
<p>Ξn = m0cvT0
[
</p>
<p>nk &minus; 1&minus; k (n&minus; 1)
]
</p>
<p>= &minus;Wn . (15.41)
</p>
<p>So, not surprisingly, the work potential of the compressed air equals the
work that is required for its reversible filling (with opposite sign). Thus, if all
processes are fully reversible, compressed air storage gives a 100% efficient
means of energy storage. All work required to fill the container could be taken
out to produce work again, e.g. as electricity.
</p>
<p>15.6 Reversible Discharge after Cooling
</p>
<p>Real life compressed air storage will have a storage efficiency below 100% due
to irreversible losses in compressor and turbine during filling and discharge,
and due to energy loss by heat transfer from the hot compressed gas to the
environment. To get some insight, we assume that, while filling and discharge
happen adiabatically and reversibly, the container loses some heat during
storage, so that the temperature drops to TC . In this case, the state of the
air in the container is
</p>
<p>T = TC , mC = nm0 , pC =
mCRTC

</p>
<p>Since pressure and temperature are lower than directly after filling, the work
potential has dropped, ΞC &lt; Ξn.
</p>
<p>Realizing the work potential is another question. We study the inversion
of the filling process, that is a turbine for the reversible discharge of the air
into the environment. Again, we assume an adiabatic process with constant
mass flow. During discharge, the state of the air in the container changes
due to expansion. For this computation it is best to consider container and
turbine separately. With the present state in the container denoted by T , p,
u, s and so on, the discharge from the adiabatic container is given by mass
and energy balance,
</p>
<p>dm
</p>
<p>dt
= &minus;ṁ , dU
</p>
<p>dt
= &minus;ṁh . (15.44)
</p>
<p>Integration of the mass balance with the initial mass mC = nm0 gives the
mass at time t as
</p>
<p>m (t) = mC &minus; ṁt . (15.45)
With U = mcvT and h = cpT , the first law gives the temperature of the air
remaining in the container as

<p>The discharged gas is then expanded through the turbine from p to p0. For
the reversible adiabatic turbine the entropy is constant, so that the turbine

<p>15.7 Reversible Filling of a Gas Container with Heat
Exchange
</p>
<p>In the previous sections we assumed that no heat is exchanged during filling
and discharge, which would be the case when the processes are rather fast.
For a lower filling rate, since real containers are not adiabatic, there will
be heat exchange during filling, and here we study a container with heat
exchange. We assume that the container is in contact with the environment
at T0, and use Newton&rsquo;s law of cooling. The balances for mass, energy and
entropy become
</p>
<p>dm
</p>
<p>dt
= ṁ ,
</p>
<p>dU
</p>
<p>dt
= Q̇&minus; Ẇ + ṁh0 ,
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
&minus; Q̇
</p>
<p>T
= ṁs0 , (15.55)
</p>
<p>where Q̇ = α (T0 &minus; T ) is the heat exchange between the compressed gas at T
and the environment. As before, we assume that initially the container is in
equilibrium with the environment, so that it contains the mass m0 =
</p>
<p>p0V0
RT0
</p>
<p>,
and that the mass flow is constant, ṁ = const. Integration of the mass
balance gives the mass in the container at time t as
</p>
<p>m (t) = ṁt+m0 .
</p>
<p>With S = ms and the mass balance, the entropy balance assumes the form
</p>
<p>m

</p>
<p>dt

<p>The filling pressure follows from the ideal gas equation, p = mRTV0 . Of course,
for the adiabatic case (α = 0) the solution of Sec. 15.4 fulfills both equations.
</p>
<p>For the non-adiabatic case, the equation for temperature cannot be solved
with pencil and paper, but must be solved on a computer. The numerical so-
lution T (t) can then be used to determine the compressor power (15.59) and
the total work W =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>Ẇdt. Figure 15.7 shows, in dimensionless form, mass,
temperature, pressure and compressor work as functions of time, comparing
the adiabatic case (α = 0, dashed), and the case with heat loss to the envi-
ronment (α 
= 0, continuous). Less work is required in the latter case, since,
due to the constant heat loss, the temperature, and thus the pressure is lower.
For the data given with the figure, the total work requirement for filling (di-
mensionless) is, Wm0RT0 = &minus;34.26 for the adiabatic case, and
</p>
<p>W
m0RT0
</p>
<p>= &minus;22.28
for the non-adiabatic case.
</p>
<p>While non-adiabatic filling requires less work, the work potential of the
filling (same mass) is less as well, due to lower pressure. The heat loss to
the environment will continue after filling is completed. Accordingly, the fill-
ing pressure, and the work potential will drop after filling is completed. We
consider the work potential (exergy) in case that the filling temperature has
dropped to the environmental temperature T0. Then the state of the air in
the cavern is
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>m0
= n , T = T0 , p =
</p>
<p>mRT0
V0
</p>
<p>, s = cp ln
T0

</p>
<p>&minus;R ln p

<p>with the work potential (exergy)
</p>
<p>Ξ0 = m0cvT0 (k &minus; 1) (n lnn&minus; n+ 1) . (15.61)
</p>
<p>The non-dimensional value corresponding to n = 11 (the final state in
Fig. 15.7) is Ξ0m0RT0 = 16.38. Thus, if the container is filled adiabatically
and then cools to environmental temperature, the work potential is only half
of the filling work. Of course, irreversibilities during filling will increase the
work requirement, and irreversibilities during discharge will reduce the work
output below Ξ0 so that in the end the storage efficiency is relatively low.</p>

<p>15.8 CAES: Compressed Air Energy Storage
</p>
<p>Renewable energy resources such as wind power or solar energy suffer from
the fact that one cannot align the times of energy generation and energy de-
mand. Large scale use of renewable energy therefore requires efficient storage
mechanisms for the energy. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems
are suggested as one means to this end. The idea is to use renewable energy
at the time of production to fill a big cavern, e.g. an abandoned salt mine,
with compressed air. Later, when energy demand arises, the compressed air
in the cavity can be expanded through a turbine to generate electricity.
</p>
<p>The filling and discharge problems discussed above can be considered as
prototypes of the processes in a compressed air storage system. But, of course,
what happens in realistic systems differs from the idealized description con-
sidered so far: First of all, the compressor used to fill the cavern, and the
turbine used to expand the air, will not be reversible, but both will loose
some work to friction. Typically, the temperature of the gas fed into the cav-
ern by the compressor differs from the temperature of the gas in the cavern,
entropy is generated as the two mix. As the air in the cavern heats up due
to compression there will be heat flow from the hot gas to the colder cavern
wall, entropy is generated in heat transfer over finite temperature differences.
Moreover, when simply a turbine is used to expand the air leaving the cavern,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.8 CAES: Compressed Air Energy Storage 363
</p>
<p>the exhaust temperature will typically lie below the environmental temper-
ature. More entropy is generated as the cold turbine exhaust mixes with
the environmental air. Since entropy generation means work loss, the storage
efficiency will always be below 100%.
</p>
<p>A simplified CAES system is depicted in Fig. 15.8: An adiabatic irreversible
compressor (1-2) pushes air into the cavern, the compressor power is provided
by renewable energy, indicated in the figure by a wind turbine. After filling
is completed, the air sits a while in the cavern (state C). Cavern temperature
TC (t) and pressure pC (t) change over time. Since the simple expansion of the
air through a turbine leads to cooling and external loss, one typically reheats
the air that leaves the cavern. In the system studied here, the reheat occurs
by means of a regenerator (C-3) and a combustion chamber (3-4), that is a
fuel is used to add heat to the system. The compressed reheated air is then
expanded in the turbine (4-5) and the turbine exhaust is run through the
regenerator (5-6) before it is discharged into the environment.
</p>
<p>With this set-up, a CAES system is not a pure energy storage system
but a mix between a storage system and a conventional gas turbine. In a
conventional gas turbine the compressor work is provided by the turbine,
and thus comes from the fuel. In a CAES system, the compressor work is
provided by an external source, either a regenerative source like wind or
solar, or surplus electricity from conventional power plants at times of weak
demand.

</p>
<p>In a realistic system, the compressor power depends on the amount of re-
newable energy available for storage. To simplify the problem we consider
constant mass flow ṁ and treat air as ideal gas with constant specific heats.
Typically, the cavern is not emptied to environmental pressure, but is main-
tained in a window, pmin &le; pC (t) &le; pmax, to ensure sufficient pressure ratio
in expansion and even power generation.
</p>
<p>For compressor, regenerator and turbine, we can use the usual expressions
for exit properties, work, and heat. The only difference to steady state op-
eration is that due to the changing state in the cavern all temperatures and
pressures change over time.
</p>
<p>The adiabatic irreversible compressor draws air at environmental state
p1 = p0, T1 = T0 and compresses it to the cavern pressure pC (t). The com-
pressor power is given by

<p>For the description of the cavern state we need the time dependent first law

<p>The above equations can be easily solved on the computer. To get some

hour long segments of filling&ndash;resting&ndash;discharge&ndash;resting. The cavern volume is
VC = 250000m
</p>
<p>3. All other parameters are set somewhat arbitrarily, so that
the basic characteristics of the process become evident: The coefficient for
Newton&rsquo;s law was chosen as α = 1000 kWK , which is high enough to almost
equilibrate air and cavern wall over the resting period. The mass in the cavern,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>366 15 Transient and Inhomogeneous Processes in Open Systems
</p>
<p>and the mass flow ṁ, are adjusted so that the cavern pressure oscillates
between 20 and 50 bar. The turbine inlet temperature, which is controlled
by fuel addition, is set to T4 = 1000K. The equation presented above can
be solved with an easy numerical stepping system. To have no influence of
initial conditions, the equations must be solved over several cycles. Figure
15.8 shows, for one cycle, mass, pressure, temperatures, work and heat for
the cavern and the devices.
</p>
<p>We point to some distinctive features: During filling, cavern pressure and
temperature go up, they reach their maximum when filling stops. Subse-
quently, both drop, due to isochoric cooling by heat transfer to the cavern
walls. In discharge both drop further due to expansion. When discharge is fin-
ished, temperature is slightly below the wall temperature, hence it increases
during the low pressure rest period. Compressor power and exit temperature
increase during the filling period, since the compressor has to work over an
increasing pressure ratio. Turbine power decreases during discharge, since the
pressure ratio goes down.

</p>
<p>There are several efficiency measures that can be used to evaluate the
performance of the system. The simplest is the ratio between overall work
produced by the turbine and energy input from renewable energy and fuel,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.8 CAES: Compressed Air Energy Storage 367
</p>
<p>ηoverall =
WT
</p>
<p>Q+ |WC |
= 0.475 . (15.74)
</p>
<p>Here, WT ,WC , Q are the time integrals of ẆT , ẆC , Q̇. This measure assigns
the same importance to the renewable energy used to drive the compressor
and the heat from the fuel. For the given data, less than half of the energy
input is converted into work.
</p>
<p>When the interest is mainly about the fuel usage, or the accompanying
release of CO2 into the atmosphere, which both are proportional to the heat
required to produce the work output, one will use the thermal efficiency
</p>
<p>ηthermal =
WT
Q
</p>
<p>= 0.940 . (15.75)
</p>
<p>Since the compressor work must not be provided by the turbine, the back
work ratio is zero, and the thermal efficiency is about twice that of a conven-
tional Brayton cycle with regenerator. This efficiency assigns no cost to the
renewable energy.
</p>
<p>The storage efficiency of the system is the percentage of compressor work
(input) that is recovered in the expansion (output). The output comes from
the fuel and the storage, and it is a question of interpretation how much can
be attributed to the fuel. It seems sensible to compare the CAES with a heat
engine with a thermal efficiency ηHE , so that its net work is WHE = ηHEQ.
The difference between the CAES turbine work, WT and the net work WHE
is due to the storage, and therefore we define the storage efficiency as
</p>
<p>ηstorage =
WT &minus; ηHEQ
</p>
<p>WC
. (15.76)
</p>
<p>Clearly, the efficiency value depends on the type of heat engine one considers
for comparison. State of the art combined cycle power plants reach thermal
efficiencies of 60%, which gives a rather low storage efficiency ηstorage = 0.347.
However, the comparison between CAES and combined cycle is somewhat
unfair, since both will be used for different purposes. The steam engine in the
combined cycle has large start-up and shut-down times, so that the cycle must
run at steady states for long periods to provide base power. By construction,
the CAES only operates from time to time, and one will run it at peak
power demand. Gas turbine systems have short start-up times, and therefore
are often used to provide power at times of large demand. Therefore, it is
more reasonable to compare CAES to a typical Brayton cycle, which, with
regenerator, can have efficiencies of up to ηHE = 42%. The corresponding
storage efficiency is ηstorage = 0.531.</p>

<p>15.1. Heating of a Room
A room of volume 75m3 contains air, initially at T0 = 273K. A heater sup-
plies heat at a rate of 2000W. Since air can leave or enter the room through
small gaps in windows and doors, the pressure in the room is equal to the
outside pressure of 1 bar at all times. Assume that no air enters the room.
</p>
<p>Consider air as an ideal gas with constant specific heats, and assume that
all properties inside the room are homogeneous.

and temperature of the air in the room as a function of time and plot the
result.
</p>
<p>2. Consider the same problem with heat losses. For this, assume that the heat
losses are proportional to the difference between the temperatures inside
and outside (assume Toutside = T0 = 273K), that is Q̇loss = αA (T0 &minus; T ).
Here, α = 90 kJm2 hK , is the heat transfer coefficient, and A = 60m

of the pipe section of length dx with the environment at T0 can be described
by Newton&rsquo;s law as δQ̇ = α (T0 &minus; T ) dx. For the following, assume that the
fluid has constant specific heat cp and ignore kinetic and potential energies.

p1. Due to friction, the pressure drops as δp = &minus;βdx along the distance
dx. Assume that the fluid is incompressible and has constant specific heat c

<p>More on Property Relations
</p>
<p>16.1 Measurability of Properties
</p>
<p>Some properties are easy to measure, and thus quite intuitive, e.g., pressure
p, temperature T and specific volume v. Accordingly, the thermal equation
of state, p (T, v) can be measured with relative ease. Other properties cannot
be measured directly, for instance internal energy u or enthalpy h, which
must be determined by means of applying the first law to a calorimeter, or
entropy s, which must be determined from other properties by integration of
the Gibbs equation.
</p>
<p>The Gibbs equation
Tds = du+ pdv (16.1)
</p>
<p>gives a differential relation between properties for any simple substance. Its
analysis with the tools of multivariable calculus, as presented below, shows
that specific internal energy u = U/m, specific enthalpy h = H/m, specific
Helmholtz free energy f = u&minus;Ts, and specific Gibbs free energy g = h&minus;Ts
are potentials when considered as functions of particular variables. The eval-
uation of the potentials leads to a rich variety of relations between thermo-
dynamic properties which will be derived and explored in this chapter. In
particular, these relate properties that are more difficult, or even impossible,
to measure to those that are more easy to measure, and thus reduce the
necessary measurements to determine data for all properties.
</p>
<p>Later, in Chapter 17, it will be seen that the thermodynamic potentials
play an important role in finding the equilibrium states of a system.
</p>
<p>16.2 Thermodynamic Potentials and Maxwell

<p>This equation suggests to consider the internal energy u as a function of
entropy s and volume v, that is u (s, v). Its exact differential (u is a state
function) is given by
</p>
<p>du =

</p>
<p>. (16.4)
</p>
<p>Thus, the internal energy u (s, v) is a potential, in the sense that temperature
T (s, v) and pressure p (s, v) are obtained from derivatives of u.
</p>
<p>The order of second derivatives can be exchanged,

</p>
<p>and since u is a potential for T and p, we find a relation between the deriva-
tives of T and p, one of the so-called Maxwell relations,

<p>. (16.6)
</p>
<p>For the novice, expressions like (16.6) seem to be just mathematical sym-
bols. However, all expressions have a clear meaning which derives from the
properties they entail. For instance, the expression
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;T
&part;v
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>s
gives the change of
</p>
<p>temperature with volume at constant entropy. It can be measured, in prin-
ciple, by varying the volume of the system by a small amount dv while the
entropy s stays constant, and measuring the associated change in tempera-
</p>
<p>ture dT . Similarly, the expression
(
</p>
<p>&part;p
&part;s
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>v
describes the change of pressure with
</p>
<p>entropy at constant volume. It can be measured, in principle, in a system at
constant volume v by varying the entropy by ds and recording the associated
pressure change dp. Similar interpretations apply to the expressions in (16.4).
</p>
<p>The above partial derivatives are, in fact, not accessible to measurements
since one of the variables is entropy: since there is no direct measurement of
entropy, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to conduct an experiment in
which entropy is changed by a given amount ds, or fixed at a given value s.1
</p>
<p>To find more relations of the same kind, we use that &minus;pdv = &minus;d (pv)+vdp,
which leads to a shift in variables from v to p, a so-called Legendre transform
</p>
<p>1 Earlier we learned that an adiabatic and reversible process is isentropic. Thus,
a process at constant entropy s can be achieved in a very slow experiment in an
isolated container. However, the actual value of entropy for the given experiment
cannot be determined through measurement.</p>

<p>(Adrien-Marie Legendre, 1752-1833). With this, the Gibbs equation (16.2)
becomes du = Tds+ vdp&minus; d (pv), and by introducing enthalpy as

<p>h = u+ pv , (16.7)
</p>
<p>the Gibbs equation assumes the alternative form
</p>
<p>dh = Tds+ vdp . (16.8)
</p>
<p>This equation points to considering enthalpy h as a function of entropy s and
pressure p, where now h (s, p) is a potential, with

&part;s&part;p . Again all partial derivatives
</p>
<p>contain the entropy s as one of the variables, and therefore they are not
accessible to measurements.
</p>
<p>Similarly, we can apply a Legendre transform to the term Tds = d (Ts)&minus;
sdT in the Gibbs equation. This transformation exchanges the variable s,
which cannot be measured directly, by the variable T , which can be measured.
As a result, we find new potentials, the free energies.

<p>It is important to note that the thermodynamic properties u, h, f, g are
only potentials when considered as functions of the given variables. That is
only u (s, v), h (s, p), f (T, v), g (T, p) are potentials! One can use property
relations to change the variables, for instance with the thermal equation of
state p (T, v) one obtains g (T, p) = g (T, p (T, v)) = g (T, v)&mdash;however, as
function of T and v the Gibbs free energy is not a potential.

<p>Gibbs equation and Maxwell relations can be used to obtain additional rela-
tions between properties which will form the center of the following section
on measurement of thermodynamic properties. To proceed, we consider en-
ergy and entropy in the Gibbs equation (16.2) as functions of temperature
and volume, u (T, v), s (T, v), and evaluate their differentials as</p>

<p>A faster approach to the first relation is to take the partial derivative of the

in (16.16)1, we find an equation for the volume dependence of internal energy

</p>
<p>Since internal energy cannot be measured directly, the left hand side cannot
be determined experimentally. However, the right hand side is determined
by the thermal equation of state, p (T, v), which is easy to measure. The
equation states that the volume dependence of the internal energy is known
from measurement of the thermal equation of state.

<p>For instance for the ideal gas p (T, v) = RT/v and thus

</p>
<p>the internal energy of the ideal gas is independent of volume, and therefore
depends only on temperature, u = u (T ). While we have used this from the
beginning as an experimental fact, we see here that it is a direct consequence
of the Gibbs equation and the thermal equation of state.

<p>16.4 Relation between Specific Heats
</p>
<p>Our first use of (16.17) is to derive a relation between the specific heats at
constant volume and constant pressure,
</p>
<p>cv =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;T
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>v
</p>
<p>and cp =
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;h
</p>
<p>&part;T
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>. (16.20)
</p>
<p>It will be seen that, as long as the thermal equation of state is known, it
suffices to measure one of the specific heats, the other can then be determined
from the relation to be derived.
</p>
<p>We start with the first law for reversible processes in differential form,
du = δq &minus; pdv, and insert u (T, v), so that with the above definition of cv
</p>
<p>δq = du+ pdv = cvdT +
</p>
<p>[(
</p>
<p>&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;v
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>+ p
</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>dv . (16.21)
</p>
<p>With the just found relation (16.17) this simplifies to
</p>
<p>δq = cvdT + T
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;p
</p>
<p>&part;T
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>v
</p>
<p>dv . (16.22)
</p>
<p>For a constant volume process we have dv = 0 and thus δq = cvdT which
relates the specific heat cv to the heat that must be added in an isochoric
process to raise the temperature by dT ; in fact this is the definition of cv as
a measurable quantity. Measurement of the specific heat cv (T, v) is done in
calorimeters, where a substance in a rigid container (dv = 0) originally at
temperature T is carefully heated by a known amount δq, e.g., by means of a
electrical resistor, and the corresponding temperature change dT is recorded.
Great care must be taken to control heat leaks, so that the amount of heat
added to the material is known as accurately as possible.
</p>
<p>To introduce the specific heat at constant pressure, cp, we proceed as
follows: In the last equation, we consider volume v as function of T and p
by means of the thermal equation of state v (T, p), so that dv =

<p>Thus, the two specific heats are related as

</p>
<p>. (16.26)
</p>
<p>The right hand side is known when the thermal equation of state, p (T, v), is
known. Thus, if one of the specific heats and the thermal equation of state
are measured, the other specific heat is known. It is easy to show from the
above that for the ideal gas cp &minus; cv = R.
</p>
<p>Finally, we note that straightforward application of the Gibbs equation in
(16.20) yields the equivalent expressions for the specific heats

</p>
<p>16.5 Measurement of Properties
</p>
<p>Only few thermodynamic properties can be measured easily, namely temper-
ature T , pressure p, and volume v. These are related by the thermal equation
of state p (T, v) which is therefore relatively easy to measure.
</p>
<p>The specific heats (16.20) can be measured in careful measurements where,
because of (16.26), it suffices to measure either cv or cp. These calorimetric
measurements employ the first law, where the change in temperature in re-
sponse to the heat added to the system is measured.
</p>
<p>Other important quantities, however, e.g., u, h, f, g, s, cannot be measured
directly. In the following we shall study how they can be related to measurable
quantities, i.e., T , p, v, and cv by means of the Gibbs equation and the
differential relations derived above.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>378 16 More on Property Relations
</p>
<p>We first consider the measurement of internal energy. The differential of
u (T, v) is
</p>
<p>du = cvdT +
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;u
</p>
<p>&part;v
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>dv . (16.28)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the internal energy u (T, v) can be determined by integration when
cv and
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;u
&part;v
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>T
are known from measurements. By (16.17) the term
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>&part;u
&part;v
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>T
is
</p>
<p>known through measurement of the thermal equation of state, and we can
write
</p>
<p>du = cvdT +
</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>T

</p>
<p>dv . (16.29)
</p>
<p>Thus, only the specific heat cv (T, v) must be measured when the thermal
equation of state p (T, v) is already known.
</p>
<p>To determine what measurements must be taken to determine the specific
heat cv (T, v) =
</p>

</p>
<p>. (16.31)
</p>
<p>Thus, the volume dependence of cv follows from measurement of the thermal
equation of state.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, in order to determine the specific heat cv (T, v) for all T and
v it is sufficient to measure the thermal equation of state p (T, v) for all (T, v)
and the specific heat cv (T, v0) for all temperatures T but only one volume
v0. Then, cv (T, v) follows from integration of (16.30). Finally, integration of
(16.28) gives the internal energy u (T, v).
</p>
<p>Integration is performed from a reference state (T0, v0) to the actual state
(T, v). Since internal energy is a point function, its differential is exact, and
the integration is independent of the path chosen. The easiest integration
is in two steps, first at constant volume v0 from (T0, v0) to (T, v0), then at
constant temperature T from (T, v0) to (T, v). The integration results in

<p>The internal energy can only be determined apart from a reference value
u (T0, v0). As long as no chemical reactions occur, the energy constant
u (T0, v0) can be arbitrarily chosen; see Chapter 23 on chemical reactions

<p>Here we have explicitly introduced the heats of phase change∆hi which must
be added whenever the line of integration crosses a saturation curve in the

be chosen as the enthalpy of formation, see the discussion in the chapter on

<p>After u, h and s are determined, Helmholtz free energy f and Gibbs free
energy g simply follow by means of their definitions (16.10, 16.12). Thus the
measurement of all thermodynamic quantities requires only the measurement
of the thermal equation of state p (T, v) for all (T, v) and the measurement
of the specific heat at constant volume cv (T, v0) for all temperatures, but
only one volume, e.g., in a constant volume calorimeter.2 All other quantities
follow from differential relations that are based on the Gibbs equation, and
integration.
</p>
<p>Above we have outlined the necessary measurements to fully determine all
relevant thermodynamic properties. We close this section by pointing out that
all properties can be determined if just one of the thermodynamic potentials is
known, this is shown in the next example. Since all properties can be derived
from the potential, the expression for the potential is sometimes called the
fundamental relation.
</p>
<p>16.6 Example: Gibbs Free Energy as Potential
</p>
<p>In this example we consider a particular function for the Gibbs free energy
g (T, p), to show that knowledge of one potential allows to determine all
relevant property relations, including all other potentials.
</p>
<p>We consider the fundamental relation (A is a constant with the appropriate
dimensions)
</p>
<p>g (T, p) = &minus;AT
4
</p>
<p>p
.
</p>
<p>We first use that g (T, p) is a potential (16.13), which gives the entropy and
the specific volume as derivatives,

<p>s (T, p) = &minus;

<p>a accounts for the reduction in pressure due to attractive forces between the
particles. In ideal gases, the specific volume is relatively high, so that b ≪ v
and a ≪ v2, in which case the equation reduces to the ideal gas law p = RTv .
</p>
<p>While the van der Waals equation offers intuitive insight into the devia-
tion from ideal gas behavior, it only offers a qualitative description of real
gas behavior, including, as will be seen later, phase changes. Thus, despite
its quantitative inaccuracy, it serves as an important example to study ther-
modynamic principles and methods.
</p>
<p>16.8.1 Determination of Constants a, b
</p>
<p>The constants a and b are related to microscopic quantities, namely the eigen-
volume of gas molecules, and the interaction potential between gas molecules.
Their values a, b can be determined from property data at the critical point.
</p>
<p>The critical isotherm has a horizontal inflection point at the critical point,
so that

<p>T,cr
</p>
<p>= 0 . (16.49)
</p>
<p>Thus, together with the van der Waals equation (16.48) itself evaluated at
the critical point, we have three conditions to be fulfilled at the critical point,
which gives, after a brief calculation,
</p>
<p>pcr =

<p>water: Tcr = 647.3K , pcr = 22.09MPa , vcr = 3.156&times; 10&minus;3 m

</p>
<p>(16.51)

(16.52)
</p>
<p>The actual values for the gas constants of helium and water are 2079 JkgK and
</p>
<p>462 JkgK , respectively, and we see that the van der Waals equation predicts
</p>
<p>wrong values of the gas constants, with an error of about 20% for helium
and 38% for water. The bigger error for water can be attributed to the more
complex character of the dipole water molecules and their interaction among
themselves, which makes them, other than the monatomic &ldquo;spherical&rdquo; helium
atoms, not well suited for the arguments on interaction and eigenvolume that
lead to the van der Waals equation.</p>

. (16.55)
</p>
<p>In this dimensionless form, the equation is independent of the type of gas, all
factors are independent of the type of gas. This somewhat surprising finding
is known as the principle of corresponding states.
</p>
<p>Figure 16.1 shows isothermal lines in the π-υ-diagram (i.e., the dimen-
sionless p-v-diagram). The critical isotherm (τ = 1) exhibits the horizontal
inflection point at the critical point (π = υ = 1). At supercritical tempera-
tures (τ &gt; 1), the isotherms are monotonically decreasing with volume, and
for large temperatures they agree with the curves from the ideal gas law.
</p>
<p>For sub-critical temperatures, however, the curves are non-monotonic; in
</p>
<p>particular there is a portion of the curves where
(
</p>
<p>&part;v
&part;p
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>T
&ge; 0, which means
</p>
<p>that the isothermal compressibility is negative, κT = &minus; 1v
(
</p>
<p>&part;v
&part;p
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>T
&lt; 0. In
</p>
<p>the next chapter we will see that thermodynamic stability requires positive
compressibility, κT &ge; 0. Thus, these portions of the curves are unstable and
cannot be attained. In Section 17.8 it will be seen how these unstable states
are bridged by splitting of the van der Waals fluid into liquid and vapor
phases.
</p>
<p>For sufficiently small temperatures the isothermal curves predict negative
pressure. States of negative pressure are unstable, but can be reached by very
careful experiments in which they appear to be metastable.</p>

<p>16.8.3 Internal Energy and Entropy

<p>&part;T 2
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>v
</p>
<p>= 0 . (16.57)
</p>
<p>This implies that for a van der Waals gas, as for the ideal gas, the specific heat
depends only on temperature, but not on volume. Energy itself, other than
for the ideal gas, has a dependence on volume. Insertion of the above into
(16.32) and explicit integration over volume then gives the internal energy of
the van der Waals gas as
</p>
<p>u (T, v)&minus; u (T0, v0) =
&int; T

<p>16.9 Joule-Thomson Coefficient 387
</p>
<p>We recall that the coefficient a describes the influence of long range inter-
action between the particles. The above shows the explicit contribution of
these interactions on the energy of the gas. For large volume, the average
particle distance is very large, and the average particle-particle interaction
energy vanishes.

<p>To compute the entropy s (T, v) we use the Gibbs equation,

<p>As we have seen earlier, entropy measures the number of possible microscopic
realizations of the macroscopic state of a gas. In the van der Waals gas,
the volume accessible to a particle is reduced by the presence of the other
particles (measured by the coefficient b), and this reduces the number of
possible configurations, and thus the entropic contribution from volume. For
large volumes, v &minus; b ≃ v, i.e., the contribution of particle volume can be
ignored.
</p>
<p>16.9 Joule-Thomson Coefficient
</p>
<p>In a throttling process, the pressure drops while the enthalpy stays constant,
the process is isenthalpic and irreversible. The temperature, however, may
rise, fall, or stay constant. The Joule-Thomson coefficient (&part;T/&part;p)h describes
the change of temperature with pressure in an isenthalpic process.
</p>
<p>With the choice x = h, y = p, z = T , the relation (16.43)2 gives an
expression for the coefficient,

<p>Thermodynamic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>17.1 Equilibrium Conditions
</p>
<p>We introduced the second law of thermodynamics to formalize the statement
that a system which is left to itself will approach a final stable equilibrium
state. A system left completely to itself is isolated, and does not exchange
heat, work or mass with its surroundings, therefore Q̇ = Ẇ = 0; for such
a system, the second law states that in equilibrium entropy will assume a
maximum. While the initial state of a system typically is inhomogeneous,
in equilibrium we expect homogeneous temperatures and zero velocity, since
internal heat transfer will equilibrate temperature, and internal friction will
dissipate all kinetic energy. If gravity can be ignored, pressure and density
(in a single phase system) are homogeneous as well, else they might be inho-
mogeneous, as, e.g., in the barometric formula.
</p>
<p>Below, we shall confirm these expectations by evaluating the second law
for isolated systems. Thereafter, we generalize the discussion to thermody-
namic equilibria of closed systems with various boundary conditions. The
state of the system can be controlled from the surroundings of the system in
a number of ways. When the system is in thermal contact with a tempera-
ture reservoir it will assume the temperature of the reservoir, and thus the
system temperature is controlled. The system volume can be controlled by
confining material into a closed box. The system pressure can be controlled
by exerting a constant force on a piston that closes the system. The system&rsquo;s
energy E is controlled when heat and work balance, i.e., Q̇ = Ẇ , so that
dE
dt = 0. Systems at controlled temperatures or pressures will exchange heat
or work, and change their volume, as they approach their equilibrium state.
</p>
<p>We shall see that, depending on the boundary conditions, different ther-
modynamic properties will attain a minimum or a maximum in equilibrium.
However, the resulting equilibria share the same characteristics.

<p>394 17 Thermodynamic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>17.2 Equilibrium in Isolated Systems
</p>
<p>An isolated system does not exchange energy or mass with its surroundings.
Accordingly, first and second law reduce to
</p>
<p>dE
</p>
<p>dt
= 0 ,
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
= Ṡgen &ge; 0 , (17.1)
</p>
<p>with a constant mass m in the system. Since no work is exchanged, the
volume V must be constant as well. According to the second law, the state of
the system will change until the entropy has reached a maximum. However,
since mass and energy of the system do not change over time, at all times
the process is restricted by having the initial mass and energy enclosed in
the system. The approach to equilibrium is a reorganization of the local
properties of the system towards the final equilibrium state.
</p>
<p>We study the approach to equilibrium for a single phase system; heteroge-
neous systems will be discussed later, in Sec. 17.7. For this we have to consider
the total mass, energy and entropy by integration over the full system,
</p>
<p>m =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>V
</p>
<p>ρdV , E =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>V
</p>
<p>ρ
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>u+

</p>
<p>2
V2 + γz
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>dV , S =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>V
</p>
<p>ρsdV . (17.2)
</p>
<p>In order to avoid confusion with the Gibbs free energy, the gravitational
acceleration is denoted by γ. Here, ρ, T , V , and u (ρ, T ), s (ρ, T ) are the local
values of the thermodynamic properties, that is, ρ = ρ (&minus;&rarr;r ), T = T (&minus;&rarr;r ) etc.,
where &minus;&rarr;r is the location in the volume V of the system, see Sec. 2.7.
</p>
<p>Before we proceed, we need to state the momentum vector
&minus;&rarr;
M of the system.
</p>
<p>Typically, we are interested in systems that are globally at rest, where the
overall momentum vanishes, but we might consider also systems moving with
</p>
<p>a constant velocity &minus;&rarr;v , so that &minus;&rarr;M = m&minus;&rarr;v . Since all elements of the system
have their own velocity
</p>
<p>&minus;&rarr;V (&minus;&rarr;r ), we find the total momentum by summing
over the system,
</p>
<p>&minus;&rarr;
M = m&minus;&rarr;v =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>V
</p>
<p>ρ
&minus;&rarr;V dV ; (17.3)
</p>
<p>here
&minus;&rarr;V is the local velocity vector with V =
</p>
<p>&radic;&minus;&rarr;V &middot; &minus;&rarr;V . As long as no forces
act on the system, its momentum will be constant; total momentum vanishes
</p>
<p>for a system at rest in the observer frame,
&minus;&rarr;
M = 0.
</p>
<p>The equilibrium state is the maximum of entropy S under the constraints
</p>
<p>of given mass m, momentum
&minus;&rarr;
M , and energy E. The best way to account
</p>
<p>for the constraints is the use of Lagrange multipliers Λρ,
&minus;&rarr;
ΛM and ΛE to
</p>
<p>incorporate the constraints and maximize not S but</p>

</p>
<p>X (x, y, y&prime;) dx with
</p>
<p>y = y (x) and y&prime; = dy/dx, where X (x, y, y&prime;) is known, is that the first varia-
tion of the integral vanishes. This requirement results in Euler&rsquo;s differential
equation of variational calculus, ddx
</p>
<p>&part;X
&part;y&prime; &minus; &part;X&part;y = 0 (Leonhard Euler, 1707 -
</p>
<p>1783). The solution of Euler&rsquo;s equation yields the desired function y (x) that
maximizes the integral. Euler&rsquo;s equation holds also when x and y are vectors.

<p>It follows that in equilibrium the temperature is homogeneous, and equal to
the inverse Lagrange multiplier,
</p>
<p>T =

</p>
<p>ΛE
. (17.14)
</p>
<p>To evaluate the first condition, (17.7), we insert the above results for ΛE ,

</p>
<p>g = u&minus; Ts+ p
ρ
= &minus;TΛρ &minus; γz , (17.15)
</p>
<p>where g is the Gibbs free energy, and γ is gravitational acceleration. With
the temperature homogeneous, and the constant Lagrange multiplier Λρ, this
is an implicit equation for the equilibrium density, which appears as an ar-
gument in the Gibbs free energy g (ρ, T ), or, alternatively, it is an equation
for pressure p, if we write g (p, T ). Often we consider systems in which the
potential energy can be ignored. For such systems, the Gibbs free energy is
homogeneous, g (ρ, T ) = &minus;TΛρ. Homogeneous Gibbs free energy and tem-
perature implies that density and pressure are homogeneous as well. Phase
equilibrium will be discussed in Sec. 17.9.
</p>
<p>In summary, maximizing entropy in the isolated system yields that the sys-
tem is fully at rest, V = 0, has homogeneous temperature, T = 1/ΛE, and,
in the gravitational field, has inhomogeneous density and pressure, given im-
plicitly by g (T, ρ) = &minus;TΛρ&minus;γz. What remains is to determine the Lagrange
multipliers ΛE = 1/T and Λρ, which follow from the given values of mass</p>

<p>V ρ [u (T, ρ) + γz] dV in the system. Their
detailed values depend on the size and geometry of the system.
</p>
<p>17.3 Barometric and Hydrostatic Formulas
</p>
<p>To gain insight into the influence of potential energy, we evaluate (17.15) for
ideal gases and incompressible fluids. For an ideal gas, the Gibbs free energy
</p>
<p>is g (ρ, T ) = h (T )&minus;T
(
</p>
<p>s0 (T )&minus;R ln ρRTp0
)
</p>
<p>. Using this in (17.15) and solving
</p>
<p>for density gives the barometric formula,
</p>
<p>ρ = ρ0 exp
[
</p>
<p>&minus; γz
RT
</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>, (17.16)
</p>
<p>where ρ0 = p0RT exp
[
</p>
<p>&minus;ΛρR &minus;
h(T )&minus;Ts0(T )
</p>
<p>RT
</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>is the density at reference height
</p>
<p>z = 0. The ideal gas law gives the corresponding expression for pressure as
p = p0 exp
</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>&minus; γzRT
]
</p>
<p>, where p0 = ρ0RT is the pressure at z = 0.
For incompressible fluids, ρ = const., and internal energy and entropy
</p>
<p>depend only on temperature, so that the Gibbs free energy is g (T, p) =
u (T ) + pρ &minus; Ts (T ). Using this in (17.15) and solving for pressure gives the
hydrostatic pressure formula,
</p>
<p>p = p0 &minus; ργz , (17.17)
</p>
<p>where p0 = ρT [s (T )&minus; u (T ) /T &minus; Λρ] is the pressure at reference height
z = 0.
</p>
<p>17.4 Thermodynamic Stability
</p>
<p>The equilibrium state determined in the previous sections should be stable,
which means that, indeed, it should be a maximum of the integral Φ as defined
in (17.4). This requires that the second variation of Φ must be negative. In
our case, where the integrand X depends only on y, this requires negative
values for the second derivatives &part;2X/&part;y2 at the location of the maximum.
With the help of the Gibbs equation, the second derivatives can be written
as

specific heat, and thermodynamic temperature are positive,
</p>
<p>κT &gt; 0 , cv &gt; 0 , T &ge; 0 . (17.20)
</p>
<p>These conditions imply that the volume decreases when pressure is increased
isothermally, and that the temperature rises when heat is added to the sys-
tem. While this matches our daily experience, it is nevertheless remarkable
that it is guaranteed by the second law as a universal principle, valid for all
materials.
</p>
<p>17.5 Equilibrium in Non-isolated Systems
</p>
<p>Non-isolated systems exchange work or heat with their surroundings. For the
study of their equilibria, we use the first and second law in their global forms,
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
(U + Epot) = Q̇&minus; pB
</p>
<p>dV
</p>
<p>dt
,
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
&minus; Q̇
</p>
<p>TB
= Ṡgen &ge; 0 , (17.21)
</p>
<p>which are valid when the system exchanges work only via a piston. Here, pB
is the pressure at the piston boundary, and the system exchanges heat only</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.5 Equilibrium in Non-isolated Systems 399
</p>
<p>at boundary temperature TB; we shall consider only cases with homogeneous
pressure and temperature at the system boundary. For simplicity, we ignore
kinetic energy, which can be incorporated as in the previous sections, with
the same result that all elements of the system will be at rest in equilibrium.
</p>
<p>For all systems discussed below, if single phase systems are considered, the
respective maximization or minimization requirements are mathematically
very similar to the maximization of entropy as discussed above.
</p>
<p>In cases where the homogeneous boundary temperature TB is prescribed,
the role of the Lagrange multiplier ΛE is assumed by the boundary temper-
ature TB, and thus the homogeneous equilibrium temperature of the system
is T = TB.
</p>
<p>In cases where the piston pressure is prescribed, the pressure condition
g (p, T ) = &minus;TΛρ &minus; γz must be compatible with the pressure prescribed at
the piston. If gravity can be ignored, this gives g (p, T ) = g (pB, T ) = &minus;TΛρ,
hence homogeneous pressure p = pB. In cases with gravity, since we have
assumed homogeneous piston pressure, this implies horizontal piston and
g (p, T ) = g (pB, T )&minus; γ (z &minus; zB), where zB is the height of the piston.
</p>
<p>17.5.1 Adiabatic and Isochoric System
</p>
<p>For an adiabatic system, we have Q̇ = 0 and thus
</p>
<p>d
</p>
<p>dt
(U + Epot) = &minus;pB
</p>
<p>dV
</p>
<p>dt
,
</p>
<p>dS
</p>
<p>dt
&ge; 0 . (17.22)
</p>
<p>Entropy grows in an adiabatic process, until it reaches a maximum in equilib-
rium. We note that for an isochoric process, where V = const., or dVdt = 0, the
total energy E = U+Epot stays constant as well. Thus, we have in particular
</p>
<p>S =&rArr; Maximum and U + Epot = const. for Q̇ = 0, V = const. (17.23)
</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the case of a fully isolated system as discussed above, which
does not exchange heat and work with its surroundings. The equilibrium
state for this case follows from maximizing entropy under constraints of given
values for mass m and energy U + Epot.

(17.25)

<p>Note that H = U + pV is the enthalpy. The equilibrium state for this case
follows from maximizing entropy under constraints of given values for mass
m and U + pBV + Epot.

<p>E = U + Epot =&rArr; Minimum for S = const., V = const. (17.27)
</p>
<p>The equilibrium state for this case follows from minimizing energy U +Epot
under constraints of given values for mass m and entropy S. Note that en-
tropy is difficult to control, and thus this case is typically not encountered in
applications.

equilibrium state for this case follows from minimizing U+pBV &minus;TBS+Epot
under constraint of given value for mass m.
</p>
<p>17.5.6 Energy vs. Entropy
</p>
<p>Temperature, volume and pressure are far easier to control than energy and
entropy, and thus one normally encounters the last two cases for the compu-
tation of equilibria. For simple one-phase systems the results are straightfor-
ward: homogeneous temperature T , and, if gravity is ignored, homogeneous
pressures p. More complex systems, in particular systems in several phases,
and reacting and inert mixtures of several components have additional degrees
of freedom that approach equilibrium values, and it is convenient to determine
these equilibrium values under the assumption that thermal and mechanical
equilibrium, i.e., homogeneous temperature and pressure, are established al-
ready. Then, the computation of equilibrium states typically entails to find
minima of free energies, either of the Helmholtz free energy F = U &minus; TS, or
of the Gibbs free energy G = H &minus; TS.
</p>
<p>The free energies describe the competition between energy and entropy,
with the temperature as factor to determine their relative importance. We
take a look at this for the Helmholtz free energy, F = U&minus;TS. The Helmholtz
free energy can attain a minimum state either by making the energy U small,
or by making the entropic term TS large. At low temperatures, the product
TS is relatively small, thus the entropic term does not matter much, and
energy is more important; states of low energies are assumed, for instance
the liquid state, which is due to the attractive potential between molecules.
For high temperatures, however, the entropic term TS dominates, and states
of large entropy are assumed, e.g., the vapor state. For intermediate tem-
peratures, energy and entropy find a compromise, e.g., the coexistence of
vapor, which has large entropy, and liquid, which has low energy, in phase
equilibrium.
</p>
<p>17.6 Interpretation of the Barometric Formula
</p>
<p>We discuss the barometric formula (17.16) in the context of the competition
between energy and entropy, where the temperature is the deciding factor.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>402 17 Thermodynamic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>The barometric formula is quite interesting as a rough indicator on the behav-
ior of planetary atmospheres. For an exact discussion, however, one should
account for temperature variances within the atmosphere, and for the spher-
ical geometry of the planets.
</p>
<p>We consider a column of atmosphere of base area A. The number of moles
</p>
<p>in a layer of the atmosphere at height z is dn = ρ(z)M Adz, while the total
number of moles in the column is N = m/M , with m =
</p>
<p>&int;
</p>
<p>ρAdz being the
total mass in the column. The probability to find a particle in the layer at z
is given by
</p>
<p>πdz =
dn
</p>
<p>N

</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>&minus; γz

</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>dz . (17.31)
</p>
<p>π (z) as defined here is a probability density, which fulfills
&int;&infin;
0
</p>
<p>π (z)dz = 1.
Mean value and variance of the height of a particle are
</p>
<p>z̄ =
</p>
<p>&int; &infin;
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>zπ (z) dz =
R̄T
</p>
<p>Mγ

</p>
<p>&radic;
</p>
<p>&int; &infin;
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>(z &minus; z̄)2 π (z)dz = R̄T
Mγ
</p>
<p>. (17.32)
</p>
<p>For large values of z̄ and σ, gases are more likely to escape a planet.
Obviously, z̄ and σ grow with temperature, which explains why hot planets,
e.g., Mercury, have lost their atmosphere. Moreover, z̄ and σ are smaller for
larger gravitation γ, which explains why heavier planets have more stable
atmospheres: Jupiter, for instance, is a heavy gas planet. Finally, z̄ and σ
grow with decreasing molar mass M which explains why light elements are
more likely to escape from the atmosphere of a planet. Indeed, there is only
little helium left in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, although helium is one of the most
abundant elements in the universe. A good source for helium is natural gas
which was formed long ago, when Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere was richer in helium.
</p>
<p>The above discussion can be seen in the context of competition between
energy and entropy. When the temperature is low, the entropy is less impor-
tant, and the equilibrium state has a low potential energy, z̄ is small, and
z̄ = 0 for T = 0. But when the temperature is high, entropy is more impor-
tant, and tries to establish a state of even distribution within the accessible
volume. The actual state, with exponential decay, is a compromise between
the two opposing tendencies. We shall explore this competition more as we
proceed.
</p>
<p>17.7 Equilibrium in Heterogeneous Systems
</p>
<p>The thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, e.g., system entropy assumes a
maximum in isolated systems (17.23), or Gibbs free energy assumes a mini-
mum when pressure and temperature are prescribed at the boundary (17.30),
are universally valid. In this section, we evaluate the equilibrium state for a
heterogeneous system, which consists of two parts in thermal and mechani-</p>

<p>Fig. 17.1 An externally adiabatic system at constant volume, containing two dif-
ferent materials or phases
</p>
<p>cal contact. To be specific, we consider an adiabatically enclosed system at
constant volume that is divided into two parts as depicted in Fig. 17.1. The
two parts may contain different substances, or the same substance, and they
might contain different phases. The divider between the two parts can move
freely, and is diathermal, i.e., heat can pass, potential and kinetic energies
are ignored. Due to the boundary conditions for the system, total energy,
U = U1 + U2, and total volume, V = V1 + V2 are constants, but energy
and volume of the parts might change. We assume the system is in thermal
equilibrium and consider small perturbations from the equilibrium state such
that the energies and volumes of the two parts are
</p>
<p>U1 + δU , U2 &minus; δU and V1 + δV , V2 &minus; δV . (17.33)
</p>
<p>This perturbation yields a change in entropy, so that the entropy of the
perturbed state is S + δS. Since the perturbed state is an equilibrium state,
the entropy S = S1 (U1, V1) + S2 (U2, V2) is a maximum; accordingly, the
perturbation in entropy must be negative, δS &lt; 0. We have
</p>
<p>S + δS = S1 (U1 + δU, V1 + δV ) + S2 (U2 &minus; δU, V2 &minus; δV ) , (17.34)
</p>
<p>and from Taylor expansion to first order we find

</p>
<p>From the Gibbs equation TdS = dU + pdV we identify (&part;S/&part;U)V = 1/T
and (&part;S/&part;V )U = p/T , and thus the above can be rewritten (with some
reordering) as

<p>&minus; p2

</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>δV . (17.36)
</p>
<p>Since δU and δV can have arbitrary positive or negative values, the sign
condition on δS can only be fulfilled when both terms vanish. This gives the
expected equilibrium conditions for the two parts, namely that they have the
same temperatures and pressures</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>404 17 Thermodynamic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>T1 = T2 and p1 = p2 . (17.37)
</p>
<p>The above discussion can be performed for any splitting of the system, and for
different substances in the subsystem. It follows that all possible subsystems
have the same temperature and pressure, that is pressure and temperature
are homogeneous within the system.
</p>
<p>If potential energy, e.g., gravitation, plays a role, pressure is not homoge-
neous, see Sec. 17.3. Pressure distribution within one substance or phase is
then given by g (p, T ) = &minus;TΛρ &minus; γz, while the pressure is continuous at the
interface between two substances or phases.
</p>
<p>17.8 Phase Equilibrium
</p>
<p>A particular class of equilibrium states concerns equilibria between different
phases of the same substance, e.g., liquid-vapor equilibria.

<p>L
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.2 Liquid (L) and vapor (V ) phase in equilibrium at given pressure p and
temperature T
</p>
<p>Figure 17.2 shows liquid and vapor in equilibrium in a system where pres-
sure p and temperature T are fixed at the boundaries by the given mass of
the piston, and exposure to a large reservoir at T . According to (16.1) the
equilibrium state of this system is determined by a minimum of the Gibbs
free energy G, which is just the sum of the Gibbs free energies of the two
phases. The mass m = mL +mV within the system is constant, and thus we
have
</p>
<p>G = mV gV (T, p) +mLgL (T, p) = mV gV (T, p) + (m&minus;mV ) gL (T, p) .
(17.38)
</p>
<p>The specific free energies of the individual phases, gL and gV , depend only on
the intensive variables p and T . When thermal and mechanical equilibrium
are established, T and p are homogeneous throughout both phases, and the
vapor mass mV is the only variable. The chemical equilibrium is assumed
when G becomes a minimum, that is for dG/dmV = 0, which gives</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.8 Phase Equilibrium 405
</p>
<p>gV (T, p) = gL (T, p) . (17.39)
</p>
<p>Hence, in a two phase system in equilibrium, pressure, temperature and Gibbs
free energies are homogeneous. It follows that both phases can coexist only
at values for pressure and temperature (T, p) that fulfill the above condition.
Solving for p gives the saturation pressure psat (T ), with the well known
value of psat (100
</p>
<p>◦C) = 1 atm for water. Solving for T gives the saturation
temperature, Tsat (p).
</p>
<p>In case that temperature and pressure are chosen such that the Gibbs
free energies of liquid and vapor are different, the Gibbs free energy (17.38)
assumes a boundary minimum with either mL = m, mV = 0 (compressed
liquid) or mV = m, mL = 0 (superheated vapor). In detail we have for a
specified pressure p:
</p>
<p>T &lt; Tsat (p) =&rArr; gL (T, p) &lt; gV (T, p) =&rArr; mL = m, mV = 0 ,
T &gt; Tsat (p) =&rArr; gL (T, p) &gt; gV (T, p) =&rArr; mV = m, mL = 0 .
</p>
<p>The phase change can be understood as a competition between energy and
entropy. Recall that Gibbs free energy is g = h&minus;Ts. For small temperatures,
the entropic term (&minus;Ts) is relatively small, and energetic effects dominate.
Then the Gibbs free energy is small for the liquid, where the potential energy
between particles due to the molecular interaction is at a minimum, the parti-
cles are close to each other, and the volume is small. For larger temperatures,
the entropic contribution becomes more important, and the Gibbs free energy
becomes small for large entropies. Since vapor entropy grows with volume,1
</p>
<p>the vapor state prevails and the volume is large. At saturation, energetic and
entropic contributions are of comparable size, and both phases coexist.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, we have for a specified temperature T :
</p>
<p>p &gt; psat (T ) =&rArr; gL (T, p) &lt; gV (T, p) =&rArr; mL = m, mV = 0 ,
p &lt; psat (T ) =&rArr; gL (T, p) &gt; gV (T, p) =&rArr; mV = m, mL = 0 .
</p>
<p>Since vapor entropy grows with lower pressure2, the entropic term will domi-
nate even at low temperatures, if only the pressure is sufficiently small. Thus,
exposing a substance to low pressure might induce phase change.
</p>
<p>While we used liquid and vapor as example, the above derivation is not
restricted to any particular phases. For any two phases to be in equilibrium,
their Gibbs free energies must agree. For an example, revisit Fig. 6.4 in Chap-
ter 6 which shows the saturation lines for water as ice, liquid, and vapor.
</p>
<p>At the triple point, all three phases coexist in equilibrium, and their free
energies must agree (S stands for solid),
</p>
<p>gV (T, p) = gL (T, p) = gS (T, p) . (17.40)

<p>406 17 Thermodynamic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>These are two conditions for T, p and thus there is only one pair of values
Ttr, ptr at which three phases can coexist, the triple point (e.g., for water:
Ttr = 0.01
</p>
<p>◦C, ptr = 611Pa).
The conditions derived above describe the thermodynamic equilibrium of
</p>
<p>two phases, which is not always attained. Some substances can exist for very
long periods in metastable states, outside of equilibrium. A typical example is
tin, which below 13.2 ◦C is stable as a semiconductor phase, and is metallic
above. However, the phase transition does only occur at much lower tem-
peratures. Another example is carbon, for which the stable phase at room
temperature is graphite, while diamond is metastable, which obviously does
not diminish its value, both as a gem, and for toolmaking.

(17.39) which can be written as

<p>gL = gV or, with g = f + pv, as fL &minus; fV = p (vV &minus; vL) , (17.41)
</p>
<p>where p is the common pressure of the two phases, i.e., the saturation pres-

</p>
<p>pdv = p (vV &minus; vL) . (17.43)
</p>
<p>This is Maxwell&rsquo;s equal area rule, which states that the areas below the S-
shaped van der Waals curve and the straight line connecting vapor and liquid,
as shown in the figure, must be equal.
</p>
<p>The evaluation of this condition leads to transcendental equations which
must be solved numerically. Figure 17.4 shows, in dimensionless variables,
some isotherms and the computed vapor dome in the p-v-diagram.

<p>The Clapeyron equation describes the slope of the saturation curve. The
two phases, and the corresponding properties are denoted as phase &prime; and
phase &prime;&prime;, respectively. To find the Clapeyron equation, we consider a point
{psat, T } on the saturation curve, and an adjacent point on the curve
{psat + dpsat, T + dT }. For the Gibbs free energy of the latter, for one phase,
we find by Taylor expansion

<p>We use this equation to estimate the heat of evaporation at 7.5 ◦C from
measurements of saturation pressures and volumes. From steam tables we
find the following data:
</p>
<p>T1 = 278.15K , psat (T1) = 0.8721 kPa , vV (T1) = 147.12

<p>T2 = 283.15K , psat (T2) = 1.2276 kPa , vV (T2) = 106.38
m3
</p>
<p>kg .
</p>
<p>With R = 0.462 kJkg K we find hLV (7.5
◦C) = 2488.18 kJkg , which is reasonably
</p>
<p>close to the exact value of 2515 kJkg .
</p>
<p>17.12 Example: Ice Skating
</p>
<p>Another interesting application is the discussion of ice flows and ice skating.
We consider the solid-liquid equilibrium at temperatures not too far from

<p>Due to the density anomaly of water, ice swims on water. Would this not be
so, ponds and lakes would freeze completely in cold climates (ice would form
on the top, and sink), and no life could survive. Thus, the anomaly is of some
importance to our ecosystem. Note also that, considering its low molar mass,
water condenses at rather high temperatures (100 ◦C at p = 1 atm; compare
to saturation temperature of oxygen (O2) of &minus;218.8 ◦C); this is due to the
strong attractive intermolecular forces between water molecules (hydrogen
bonds).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>410 17 Thermodynamic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>Coming back to (17.49), we conclude that in order to lower the melting
temperature by 1 ◦C, the pressure must be increased by 142 bar. In other
words, to melt ice of &minus;10 ◦C the pressure must be increased by 1420 bar. Due
to the weight of the ice, the pressure inside glaciers is quite high, and the
slow flow of glaciers might be attributed to this effect, but also to plastic
deformation.
</p>
<p>Quite often, however, melting under pressure is used to explain the physics
of ice skating, but this is not a valid explanation. Indeed, high pressures would
break the ice before it could melt. The contact area for the skates would have
to be very small, to bring these high pressures on the ice. As most people
know, ice is very slippery even with street shoes, which have a large contact
area. Also one would expect a strong dependence of the skating ability on
temperature, since higher pressures are required for melting at lower tem-
peratures. Moreover, since no liquid water exist below &minus;23 ◦C, skating would
not be possible at temperatures below that. Canadian students report that
they skated without problems at temperatures below &minus;30 ◦C.
</p>
<p>Today, it is believed that the slipperiness of ice is due to a molecular layer
of water molecules at the surface which are not fixated in the lattice struc-
ture of the ice. There seems to be no stable configuration with an energetic
minimum for the surface molecules, and they dangle about. This molecular
layer behaves almost like liquid water, and thus ice is slippery.4

<p>17.4. Stirred Water
A rigid adiabatic container contains 1 litre of water at 20 ◦C. The water was
briefly stirred with a propeller, so that the average velocity is 15 ms . Consider
only the time after stirring (but not the water motion) has stopped. Under the
conditions of this process, water can be described as an ideal incompressible

2. Combine the 1st and 2nd law of thermodynamics to show that, while the

incompressibility.
</p>
<p>3. Determine the increase of temperature between the stirred state and the

</p>
<p>17.5. Approximate Equation for Saturation Pressure
In order to find an approximate equation for the saturation pressure of a
substance, assume that the liquid can be considered as an incompressible
liquid, and the vapor as an ideal gas.
</p>
<p>1. For the liquid (f) show first that incompressibility implies that the specific
heats at constant pressure and constant volume are the same. Next, assume</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>412 17 Thermodynamic Equilibrium
</p>
<p>constant specific heat cf and incompressibility and find internal energy,
enthalpy and entropy by integration. Show that
</p>
<p>uf = cf (T &minus; T0) , hf = cf (T &minus; T0) , sf = cf ln
T
</p>
<p>T0
.
</p>
<p>The assumption of incompressibility is not sufficient to obtain the relation
for hf . What contribution is missing, and why (or when) can it be ignored?
</p>
<p>2. Consider vapor (g) as an ideal gas with constant specific heats, and show
that specific enthalpy and entropy are given by
</p>
<p>hg = cp (T &minus; T0) + hfg (T0) , sg = cp ln

&minus;R ln p
</p>
<p>psat (T0)
+
</p>
<p>hfg (T0)
</p>
<p>T0
;
</p>
<p>cp is the specific heat of the vapor, hfg (T0) is the specific heat of evapora-
tion at reference temperature T0, and psat (T0) is the saturation pressure
at T0. Discuss the choice of integrating constants and give clear arguments
why hfg (T0) appears in both relations.
</p>
<p>3. Find an expression for the heat of evaporation hfg (T ).
4. Use the condition for phase equilibrium gf (T, psat (T )) = gg (T, psat (T ))
</p>
<p>to find an equation for the saturation pressure psat (T ) .
5. Use data for water and chose T0 = 273.15K to make a table with values
</p>
<p>of saturation pressure and heat of evaporation for several temperatures.
Compare to tabled data: When an error of 5% is acceptable, what is the
maximum temperature for which the approximation can be used?
</p>
<p>6. An equation that is regularly used, and gives a better fit, is the Antoine
equation
</p>
<p>log psat (T ) = A&minus;
B
</p>
<p>C + T
.
</p>
<p>Use data for water at 0.01 ◦C, 50 ◦C, and 100 ◦C to obtain the constants
A,B,C. You may use a computer program to find the constants. Plot the
saturation pressure as function of T , and make a list of values for temper-
atures up to the critical temperature 374.14 ◦C. Compare with tabulated
data.
</p>
<p>17.6. Heat of Evaporation
Use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation together with the Antoine equation for
water (see previous problem) to find a relation for the heat of vaporization,
hfg (T ). Assume that the liquid volume can be ignored against the vapor
volume, and that the vapor can be described as an ideal gas. Plot hfg (T )
over T , and compare with tabulated data. Discuss the result.
</p>
<p>17.7. Property Data: Interpolation
For a thermodynamic computation you need the Gibbs free energy, the en-
tropy, and the enthalpy of liquid water at a temperature of 97.5 ◦C and a
pressure of 1 atm. In an old and incomplete table you find the following data:</p>

<p>Use only this data to determine (a) g(97.5 ◦C, 1 atm), (b) s(97.5 ◦C, 1 atm)
and (c) h(97.5 ◦C, 1 atm).
</p>
<p>17.8. Phase Equilibrium of a Van der Waals Gas
Use Maxwell&rsquo;s equal area rule to construct the two phase region for the
dimensionless van der Waals equation. For given temperature τ you need
to determine saturation pressure πsat (τ ) and saturation volumes υf (τ ) and
υg (τ). It is best to prescribe a value for υf and then find the corresponding
values for τ , πsat, and υg.
</p>
<p>1. Write down the equations you need to solve the problem.
2. The equations are transcendental and thus must be solved numerically. Use

<p>Mixtures
</p>
<p>18.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Many applications of thermodynamics involve not single substances but mix-
tures. The challenge is to track mixture composition, and to find the prop-
erty data for the given composition. As long as mixture composition does not
change, one can deal with mixtures the same way as with simple substances,
including tabulating their properties; our treatment of air is the prime exam-
ple of this.
</p>
<p>Mixture composition can change through mixing or separation processes,
through phase changes when the components have different vapor pressures,
and through chemical reactions.
</p>
<p>There is a vast array of applications for mixture theory, in particular in
chemical engineering. Applications to be discussed include desalination of
seawater, osmotic power plants, phase equilibrium and distillation processes,
chemical equilibrium and NH3 production, and combustion.
</p>
<p>In this and the following chapters we shall provide the tools to properly
describe and evaluate these processes. The present chapter introduces addi-
tional properties to account for mixture composition, and relations between
properties of components and the mixture as a whole.
</p>
<p>18.2 Mixture Composition
</p>
<p>We consider mixtures of ν components, indicated by greek subscripts α =
1, 2, . . . , ν. The present chapter deals with non-reacting mixtures, reacting
mixtures will be discussed later.
</p>
<p>Throughout the following we assume that all components have the same
temperature T . The mixture is contained in the volume V , and the mixing
state is homogeneous, so that each component is equally distributed in V .
</p>
<p>The composition of the mixture can either be described through the masses
mα of the components contained in the volume V , or by their amount in

<p>molecule numbers Nα. Rather than tracking actual particle numbers, one
uses the mole as a unit for counting particles, with the mole number defined
as

mα
Mα
</p>
<p>. (18.1)
</p>
<p>Here A = 6.022&times; 1023 1mol is Avogadro&rsquo;s number, which defines the number
of particles in one mole, and Mα is the molar mass, i.e., the mass of 1mol of
particles of type α.
</p>
<p>The total mass m and the total mole number n of the mixture are obtained
by summation over all components,

</p>
<p>18.4 Mixture Properties
</p>
<p>In previous chapters, we have mainly used specific properties, that is proper-
ties per unit mass which are denoted as, e.g., vα, uα, hα, sα. For mixtures it
is often more convenient do refer to particle numbers, and thus we will often
use mole based properties, denoted as, e.g., v̄α, ūα, h̄α, s̄α.
</p>
<p>Mole and mass based quantities are related through the molar mass Mα,
in particular we have
</p>
<p>mass/mole density: ρa =
mα
V , ρ̄a =
</p>
<p>nα
V ,
</p>
<p>specific/molar volume: vα =
V
mα
</p>
<p>, v̄α =
V
nα
</p>
<p>= vαMα ,
</p>
<p>specific/molar internal energy: uα , ūα = uαMα ,
specific/molar enthalpy: hα , h̄α = hαMα ,
specific/molar entropy: sα , s̄α = sαMα .
</p>
<p>Properties of the mixture are obtained as weighted sums over the properties
of the individual components. We study this for the total internal energy, for
which we have
</p>
<p>U = mu =
ν
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>mαuα = nū =
ν
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>nαūα . (18.6)
</p>
<p>The specific internal energy, and the molar internal energy of the mixture are
obtained by division with m or n, as
</p>
<p>u =
U
</p>
<p>m
=
</p>
<p>ν

<p>α=1

<p>Fig. 18.1 Mixing of components at constant T and p
</p>
<p>Above, we have not indicated the dependencies between properties. In
general, the properties of one component will depend on the presence of
all other components. For instance, the internal energy of component α will
depend on temperature T and total pressure p of the mixture, and on all mole
fractions Xβ , β = 1, . . . , ν, that is ūα = ūα (T, p,Xβ). Therefore tabulated
data for single components (where Xα = 1 and Xβ = 0 for β 
= α) normally
cannot be used. As will be seen, tabulated data for pure components can only
be used for ideal gas mixtures, and ideal mixtures.
</p>
<p>While all components have the same temperature T , they contribute to
pressure differently. The partial pressure pα is the contribution of component
α to total pressure p, with
</p>
<p>p =
ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>pα . (18.10)
</p>
<p>Note that, in general, pα = pα (T, p,Xβ), that is the partial pressure of a
component will depend on the state and composition of the mixture.
</p>
<p>18.5 Mixing Volume, Heat of Mixing and Entropy of
Mixing
</p>
<p>As components are mixed at constant temperature and pressure the extensive
properties might change. To properly account for the change, we consider ν
components in an initial unmixed state (I) where each component is at the
same temperature, T , and pressure, p. The components are mixed while keep-
ing temperature and pressure constant, the final state (E) is a homogeneous
mixture, see Fig. 18.1. We ask for the corresponding changes in total volume,
total enthalpy, and total entropy.
</p>
<p>The volume change between initial and final state is computed as1
</p>
<p>1 This and the other equations in this section are written with molar quantities and
mole numbers. It is straightforward to write all in specific properties and masses,
e.g. Vmix = mγvγ (T, p, cβ)&minus;

<p>α=1 mαvα (T, p).</p>

</p>
<p>Vmix = VE &minus; VI = nγ v̄γ (T, p,Xβ)&minus;
ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>nαv̄α (T, p) , (18.11)
</p>
<p>where v̄α (T, p) denotes the specific volume of component α alone at (T, p) and
v̄γ (T, p,Xβ) denotes the specific volume of any component γ in the mixture
of composition Xβ (β = 1, . . . , ν) at (T, p). Note that in the mixed state all
components are distributed over the volume of the mixture, VE .
</p>
<p>The change of volume is due to spatial hindrances or advantages on the
molecular scale. For instance a mixture of 1 litre of water with 1 litre of
ethanol (C2H5OH) yields a mixing volume of 1.93 litres.
</p>
<p>When volume ratios are used to define the composition of a mixture, it
must be clarified whether the volume of the component is related to the

<p>where Hmix is the heat that must be exchanged in order to keep the tempera-
ture T constant for the mixing process. Here, h̄α (T, p) is the molar enthalpy
of component α alone at (T, p) and h̄α (T, p,Xβ) is the molar enthalpy of the
component α in a mixture of composition Xβ (β = 1, . . . , ν) at (T, p).
</p>
<p>The enthalpy and internal energy are influenced by the interaction poten-
tial between molecules. In a pure substance, particles of type α interact only
with particles of the same type. In a mixture, however, particles of type α
are surrounded by different types of particles β (β = 1, . . . , ν), which leads
to different molecular interaction potentials, and thus a change in internal
energy ūα and enthalpy h̄α for the particles of type α as compared to the
pure substance. A more detailed exploration of this will come in Sec. 22.9.

</p>
<p>18.6 Ideal Gas Mixtures
</p>
<p>We first consider ideal gas mixtures, which are particularly simple. In ideal
gases, due to the large average distance between particles, the potential en-
ergies between particles can be ignored against their microscopic kinetic en-
ergies. Then, the individual components are not affected by the presence of
other components, there is no enthalpy of mixing, and the ideal gas law holds
for the individual components and the mixture.2
</p>
<p>The partial pressure of one component distributed over the mixture volume
V is given by the ideal gas law
</p>
<p>pα =
mα
V
</p>
<p>RαT =
nα
V
</p>
<p>R̄T , (18.14)
</p>
<p>where R̄ = 8.314 kJkmolK is the universal gas constant, and Rα = R̄/Mα. The
second form of the ideal gas law shows that the behavior of all ideal gases
depends only on mole number, temperature and volume, but not on the type
of gas.
</p>
<p>The total pressure is just the sum of the partial pressures. For ideal gases,
where the partial pressures are unaffected by the presence of other molecules,
this is known as Dalton&rsquo;s law (John Dalton, 1766-1844),
</p>
<p>p =

R̄T =

<p>V

</p>
<p>Here R = R̄/M is the gas constant for the mixture and M is the mixture&rsquo;s
mean molar mass (18.5). Thus, with the proper molar masses, the components
and the mixture obey the ideal gas law.
</p>
<p>Division of the ideal gas laws for the component and the mixture shows
that for ideal gas mixtures the pressure ratio equals the mole ratio,

</p>
<p>In case that the ideal gas mixture is separated, so that each individual
component is at the mixture pressure p and temperature T in its own volume
Vα, the ideal gas law for the components reads
</p>
<p>Vα =
nαR̄T

Gases

<p>For ideal gases, all energies and enthalpies depend only on the temperature

enthalpy of mixing, Hmix = Umix + pVmix = 0. With that, the energies and

<p>18.8 Entropy of Mixing for Ideal Gas
</p>
<p>While volume, energy and enthalpy do not change when originally separated
ideal gases at (T, p) (state I) are mixed, so that the mixture is at (T, p) (state
II), the entropy does change. We compute the entropy for the two cases.
</p>
<p>Component α fills the mixture volume V at temperature T and is at its
partial pressure pα. Its entropy is not affected by the presence of other com-
ponents, it reads just as for a single component,
</p>
<p>s̄α (T, pα) = s̄
0
α (T )&minus; R̄ ln
</p>
<p>pα
p0
</p>
<p>, (18.22)
</p>
<p>where s̄0α (T ) denotes the entropy of α alone at (T, p0) and is tabulated.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>422 18 Mixtures
</p>
<p>With Xα =

p the molar entropy of one component in the mixture can be

0
α (T )&minus; R̄ lnXα &minus; R̄ ln
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>p0
. (18.23)
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the entropy of component α depends only on the relative amount
of α, while the composition of other components Xβ (β 
= α) does not play
a role.
</p>
<p>In the unmixed state, all components are at (T, p) (i.e., Xα = 1), and
in the mixed state the components are at (T, pα). The corresponding total
entropies follow from summation over all components as

<p>The entropy of mixing is positive, since Xα &le; 1. Thus, entropy grows in
mixing, and we conclude that mixing is an irreversible process, with a work
loss. We shall later discuss how work could be obtained by reversible mixing.

<p>18.9 Gibbs Paradox
</p>
<p>We consider two different ideal gases in a container of Volume V , halved by
a slider. Both gases are at the same temperature and pressure (T, p), and
their mole numbers are equal n1 = n2 =
</p>
<p>n
2 . When the slider is pulled out,
</p>
<p>the two gases mix while pressure and temperature remain unchanged. The
partial pressures for both gases are
</p>
<p>p1 = p2 =
n1RT
</p>
<p>V

</p>
<p>RT
</p>
<p>V

</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>2
. (18.28)
</p>
<p>In the final equilibrium state, both gases are evenly distributed throughout
the container. Entropy has grown, and the entropy of mixing for this process
is</p>

<p>α=1
</p>
<p>nα ln
pα
p
</p>
<p>= nR̄ ln 2 &gt; 0 . (18.29)
</p>
<p>When the slider is pushed back to separate the two parts of the container,
the state is quite different from the initial state, since both parts now con-
tain mixture. The difference between the two states becomes manifest in the
positive value of the entropy of mixing.
</p>
<p>Let us now consider that both gases are identical. The slider can be pulled
out and pushed back at any time, without any change in the state of the
gas, which is always the same gas at (T, p) in both compartments. Yet, the
expression for the entropy of mixing, Eq. (18.29), predicts an entropy increase.
This increase should not be present for a single gas, and thus the prediction
of a positive entropy of mixing is considered to be a paradox, known as Gibbs
paradox.
</p>
<p>The paradox can be resolved by noting that the particles of just one type
of gas cannot be distinguished. In particular, we cannot recognize whether an
arbitrary particle picked from the gas was originally in a particular partition
of the container. Indeed, could we mark the particles in one of the partitions
at the initial time (before the slider is pulled out), the final state would show
that particles that were on one side initially are now distributed over the
whole container. In short, the entropy of mixing can only be computed for
the mixing of distinguishable species.
</p>
<p>18.10 Example: Isentropic Expansion through a
Nozzle
</p>
<p>We consider the isentropic expansion of a mixture of oxygen (XO2 = 0.2)
and carbon dioxide (XCO2 = 1&minus;XO2 = 0.8) entering a nozzle at V1 = 25 ms ,
p1 = 6bar, T1 = 1200K and leaving at p2 = 1bar. We ask for the temperature
T2 and the velocity V2 at the nozzle exit.

<p>The molar mass of the mixture is M = XO2MO2+XCO2MCO2 = 41.6

Since the process is reversible and adiabatic, it is isentropic, that is the molar

<p>18.12 Ideal Mixtures
</p>
<p>Ideal mixtures are defined as mixtures with vanishing volume and heat of
mixing, and an entropy of mixing just as that of the ideal gas, i.e.,
</p>
<p>Vmix = Hmix = 0 , Smix = &minus;
&sum;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>nαR̄ lnXα . (18.30)
</p>
<p>Ideal gas mixtures are a special case of ideal mixtures. In particular, the
theory of ideal mixtures can be applied to dilute liquid solutions.
</p>
<p>As for the ideal gas, the first two conditions (18.30)1,2 for ideal mixtures
state that mixing does not affect energy. This would be the case if inter-
molecular potential of the various components are equal, or at least rather</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>426 18 Mixtures
</p>
<p>similar, so that the potential energy of a pair of identical molecules (α-α-pair)
is similar to that of a dissimilar pair (α-β-pair).
</p>
<p>The entropy of mixing warrants more detailed discussion. It is best moti-
vated through Boltzmann&rsquo;s microscopic interpretation of entropy as discussed
earlier, in Sec. 4.14. The microscopic definition of entropy reads
</p>
<p>S = k lnΩ , (18.31)
</p>
<p>where k = R̄/A = 1.3806 &times; 10&minus;23 JK is Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant, and Ω is the
number of microscopic realizations of a given macroscopic state. For instance,
for an ideal gas, simply speaking, a macroscopic state is given by the values
of temperature, pressure, and velocity of the gas, while a microscopic state
is given by the location and velocities of the gas particles. The entropy can
be computed from (18.31) for rather complex systems, e.g., polymers, but for
many systems the evaluation of the equation becomes too cumbersome to be
done analytically.
</p>
<p>A macroscopic state is for instance given by mass, volume, and temperature
of a sample of substance. While the macroscopic state is maintained, due to
the thermal motion of the particles the system runs through a succession of its
accessible microscopic states. At standard condition, the average speed of a
gas molecule is of the order of the speed of sound (&sim; 350 ms ), and it undergoes
about 1010 collisions per second. Accordingly, the system goes through a vast
number of microstates per second.
</p>
<p>While the full evaluation of S = k lnΩ requires consideration of the full
microstate, i.e., locations and velocities of particles, we can consider the lo-
cations alone to compute the entropy of mixing. We study a container with
N =
</p>

larger number of microstates. Equation (18.32) gives Ω = 6; the states are</p>

<p>Thus, the mixed state, where the wall is removed has more microscopic real-
izations than the unmixed state, and the higher entropy.

<p>Note that the original configuration forms one of the accessible microstates
of the unrestrained system as well. The probability that this state is 1/Ω,
which is indeed the probability that any particular microstate is assumed.
For real systems, the particle numbers are huge, and the number of possible
configurations is enormous. The probability to find the original configuration,
which was maintained by the wall before it was removed, is negligible, and
most microstates will be mixed&mdash;thus mixed states will be observed.

<p>The computation of the entropy of mixing in this section relied on the
assumption that there are as many location cells as particles, which is
appropriate for simple liquids. The reader might wonder how the entropy of
mixing for an ideal gas comes about, for which there are far more cells than
particles. We briefly run through the necessary arguments: To deal with an
ideal gas mixture, we consider empty cells as an additional species with count</p>

<p>18.13 Entropy of Mixing and Separation Work
</p>
<p>We consider mixing and separation of ideal mixtures at constant tempera-
ture T . The combined first and second law for a closed system at constant
temperature T reads
</p>
<p>Ẇ = &minus;T Ṡgen &minus;
dU &minus; TS
</p>
<p>dt
, (18.38)
</p>
<p>or, after integration over the duration of the process,
</p>
<p>W12 + TSgen = &minus; (U2 &minus; U1) + T (S2 &minus; S1) , (18.39)
</p>
<p>where Sgen =
&int; t2
t1
</p>
<p>Ṡgendt is the total entropy generation for the process.
We consider mixing first, where state 1 is the unmixed state, and state 2
</p>
<p>is the mixed state. Then, since Umix = 0 for an ideal mixture,
</p>
<p>W12 + TSgen = TSmix &minus; Umix = TSmix &gt; 0 . (18.40)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.14 Non-ideal Mixtures 429
</p>
<p>When the mixing is fully irreversible, no work is drawn, W12 = 0, and the
entropy generation is just the entropy of mixing, Sgen = Smix. However, the
equation shows that it is possible to generate the work
</p>
<p>W12 = TSmix &minus; TSgen &gt; 0 . (18.41)
</p>
<p>In a real device, the irreversibilities of the process diminish the work by
TSgen. The maximum work is obtained from a fully reversible process as
</p>
<p>W revmix = TSmix . (18.42)
</p>
<p>Note that more work can be produced at higher temperature.
Now we consider separation, where state 1 is the mixed state, and state 2
</p>
<p>is the unmixed state. Then, again with Umix = 0,
</p>
<p>W12 = &minus;TSgen &minus; TSmix &lt; 0 . (18.43)
</p>
<p>Work is required for separation (TSmix &gt; 0) and to overcome irreversibilities
in the device (TSgen &gt; 0). The minimum separation work is obtained or a
fully reversible process, where Sgen = 0, as
</p>
<p>W revsep = &minus;TSmix . (18.44)
</p>
<p>The separation work is directly proportional to the entropy of mixing, less
work is required for separation at lower temperatures.
</p>
<p>Section 21 will present a closer look at desalination plants, which sepa-
rate salt from water, and osmotic power plants, which use mixing for power
generation. 21.5.
</p>
<p>18.14 Non-ideal Mixtures
</p>
<p>The equilibrium condition for a mixture at given pressure p and temper-
ature T is that the Gibbs free energy assumes a minimum. We denote the
Gibbs free energies of the unmixed and the mixed states by Gunmixed, Gmixed,
respectively. Both are related as
</p>
<p>Gmixed = Gunmixed +Gmix with Gmix = Hmix &minus; TSmix . (18.45)
</p>
<p>The equilibrium state will be the mixed state for negative Gibbs free energy
of mixing, Gmix &lt; 0, so that Gmixed &lt; Gunmixed, but it will be the unmixed
state, if Gmix &gt; 0, so that Gunmixed &lt; Gmixed.
</p>
<p>For an ideal mixture we have Hmix = 0, hence Gmix = &minus;TSmix &lt; 0.
Accordingly, ideal mixtures will assume a mixed equilibrium state.
</p>
<p>The Gibbs free energy of mixing will only be positive if the enthalpy
of mixing is large, that is for Hmix &gt; TSmix. Large enthalpy of mixing is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>430 18 Mixtures
</p>
<p>observed when the intermolecular forces between like particles are much larger
than those between unlike particles.
</p>
<p>Due to its dipole structure, water has strong polar bonds between its
molecules, while oil is non-polar. Breaking up the water bonds to form water-
oil pairs instead of water-water pairs requires energy, and hence the enthalpy
of mixing, Hmix, is positive. From the fact that oil separates from water,
we can conclude that the energetic effect exceeds the entropic effect, that is
Hmix &gt; TSmix.
</p>
<p>Table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) dissociates in water into charged ions,
Na+ and Cl&minus;, which have energetic bonds with water. Nevertheless, for water-
salt solutions, the enthalpy of mixing is positive, but smaller than the entropic
term TSmix. In dilute solutions, the energetic interaction between salt ions
and water molecules can be ignored, and the solution can be approximated
as an ideal mixture. Dissociation requires shielding of salt ions by the polar
water molecules, where several water molecules are shielding one salt ion. If
all water molecules are used for the hydrogen shells, no additional salt ions
can be dissolved, the solution becomes saturated.

acteristic of the balloon is of the form ∆p = a (VB &minus; V0)2 where ∆p is the
pressure difference between inside and outside, VB is the actual volume, the

<p>Psychrometrics
</p>
<p>19.1 Characterization of Moist Air
</p>
<p>Psychros and metro are Greek words meaning cold and measure, respectively,
and psychrometrics describes moist air: mixtures of air and water vapor with
possibly some liquid water present as well. Psychrometrics is most impor-
tant for designing proper air conditioning systems for buildings, where the
air should be not too dry or moist, to make the environment comfortable;
moreover, moisture buildup at (or in!) walls must be prevented.
</p>
<p>This chapter describes how to characterize and analyze moist air mixtures,
and discusses basic processes for moisturizing and dehumidification in HVAC
systems (Heating-Ventilating-Air-Conditioning).
</p>
<p>We consider air-vapor mixtures at temperature T and pressure p = pa+pv.
Air behaves as an ideal gas, hence the partial pressure of air, pa, follows the
ideal gas law. At the relevant temperatures, the partial pressure of the vapor
in moist air, pv, is so low that the vapor can be described as an ideal gas as
well.
</p>
<p>The vapor pressure cannot exceed the saturation pressure psat (T ). If pv &lt;
psat (T ) there is no liquid water present, but if pv = psat (T ) some liquid water
will be present either in form of droplets (fog), or as an larger amount on
the bottom. Figure 19.1 illustrates undersaturated moist air as a mixture of
air and vapor, and saturated moist air as a mixture of air, vapor, and liquid
water.
</p>
<p>Since the saturation pressure psat (T ) increases with temperature, warm
air can hold more water vapor than cold air. Cooling of moist air can lead to
condensation of water, e.g., on cold bottles, or on eyeglasses when one enters
the warm and humid air of a house coming in from a cold winter environment.
</p>
<p>The humidity ratio ω, also known as specific humidity, is defined as the
ratio of vapor and air mass in a sample of moist air of the volume V ,

<p>where it was used that, for ideal gas mixtures, Xα =

p . Whether we perceive
</p>
<p>moist air as comfortable or not depends on the temperature and the relative
humidity. In a dry environment, the human body loses a lot of moisture to
evaporation from the skin and in breathing; one must drink a lot to replenish
the moisture. In deserts, it helps to cover the body loosely with cloth, to
prevent exposure of skin to the dry air, thus limiting evaporation from the
skin. In high humidity, the air cannot accept more vapor, and thus sweat does
not evaporate which results in difficulty to regulate the body temperature.
For buildings, a relative humidity of φ ≃ 0.6 is providing the most pleasant
environment.
</p>
<p>The enthalpy of a moist air sample is
</p>
<p>H = Ha +Hv = maha +mvhv , (19.4)
</p>
<p>where ha (T ) and hv = hg (T ) are the specific enthalpies of air and water
vapor. Since the amount of vapor changes due to evaporation and condensa-
tion, it is convenient to base the specific enthalpy of moist air on the dry air
mass and we write1
</p>
<p>1 The subscript 1 + ω serves to distinguish a specific property per unit mass of
dry air, which corresponds to 1 + ω unit masses of moist air. This notation is
uncommon in the North-American literature, but it is useful to avoid confusion
with proper specific enthalpies.</p>

also on the humidity ratio ω.

</p>
<p>In isobaric cooling, see Fig. 19.2, the partial pressures of air and vapor stay
constant as long as no water condenses. The dewpoint temperature Td is
defined as the temperature at which vapor starts to condense when moist air
is isobarically cooled,2
</p>
<p>psat (Td) = pv or Td = Tsat (pv) . (19.7)
</p>
<p>Figure 19.3 illustrates the cooling and condensation process for water in air
in a T-s-diagram. Initially, the vapor is at state 1. No water condenses as the
vapor is cooled until it reaches the dewpoint (state d). In the final state, the
air is mixed with saturated vapor (state 2) and saturated liquid (state 3).

<p>19.3 Adiabatic Saturation and Wet-Bulb
Temperature
</p>
<p>When moist air of temperature T and humidity ratio ω &lt; ωsat flows over a
surface of water, some water will evaporate and the humidity of the air will
increase. Evaporation requires the heat of evaporation hfg, which is drawn
from the air and the liquid, which therefore cool down as liquid evaporates.
If there is sufficient contact between air and water, water will evaporate until
the air will finally be saturated.
</p>
<p>This effect is an important part of our life: When the body gets hot, humans
sweat, the sweat evaporates by drawing the heat of vaporization from the
body. The dryer the surrounding air is, the more vapor it can accept, and thus
cooling by sweating is more efficient in dry climates. In moist climates, e.g., in
tropical rainforests, the air can only accept little or no additional vapor, the
sweat cannot evaporate, and no cooling is achieved. In dry climates, patios
are cooled by spraying a fine mist of water. The small droplets evaporate
immediately in the dry air, and this cools the air. Mothers blow air over their
babies&rsquo; food to cool it, good restaurants serve the meals under covers, so that
the food is only in contact with the saturated moist air under the cover, and
remains hot.
</p>
<p>We study the system depicted in Fig. 19.4. Moist air at (T, p, ω) flows
through a wetted porous material, which provides a large contact surface
between air and liquid water. Pressure losses in the flow through the porous
material are ignored in the following. The air leaves in saturated state at
the so-called wet-bulb temperature Twb. We assume a steady state process
under adiabatic conditions, that is no heat is added to the air flow from the
exterior, and we assume that the make-up water flow from the reservoir is
at the wet-bulb temperature Twb. The first law for the system then reduces
to the equality between incoming and outgoing enthalpy flows,

<p>(19.9)
The temperatures of the incoming air, T , and of the wet bulb, Twb, can
be measured easily, and this measurement allows to determine the humidity
ratio ω from the above equation.
</p>
<p>Indeed, for the measurement of the wet-bulb temperature it is sufficient
to cover a thermometer with a wet cloth, and expose it to air flow. After a
while (before the cloth has dried, of course) a steady state is reached, and
the thermometer shows the wet-bulb temperature of the air flow. For the
measurement in standing air (e.g. in a room), the wet thermometer has to be
moved, and one uses a sling psychrometer: two thermometers, one dry, one
wet, on a handle are rotated in the air.
</p>
<p>19.4 Psychrometric Chart
</p>
<p>From (19.9) it is evident that determining humidity from the measurement of
dry- and wet-bulb temperatures involves some work for finding property data.
Instead of working with property tables it is practical to use a psychrometric
chart, from which all interesting data for moist air can be extracted. Through
the humidity ratio, the equations depend on the total pressure, p, and one
should take care to use the proper chart. Small daily pressure changes at
a location do not affect the results much, but one will have to account for
changes of environmental pressure with height. Figure 19.5 shows a chart for
p = 0.8 bar which would be appropriate for a location at a height of about
2000m above sea level.
</p>
<p>The psychrometric chart has the dry-bulb temperature T on the abscissa
and the humidity ratio ω on the ordinate. The diagram shows lines of constant</p>

<p>relative humidity φ, constant wet-bulb temperature Twb, constant enthalpy
h1+ω, and constant specific volume v1+ω . When two of these six quantities
are known, all others can be easily read of the diagram. The chart will be
used in subsequent sections.
</p>
<p>The construction of the psychrometric chart is not difficult. For typical
HVAC applications, vapor and dry air can be described as ideal gases with
constant specific heats, and liquid water can be described as incompressible
liquid with constant specific heat, so that
</p>
<p>ha(T ) = c
a
p(T&minus;TR) , hv(T ) = cvp(T&minus;TR)+hfg (TR) , hf (T ) = cf (T&minus;TR) ,

kg . This choice of reference values for enthalpies and temper-
</p>
<p>ature (TR) ensures that the psychrometric chart is compatible with standard
steam tables, for which the triple point enthalpy of the saturated liquid is
typically set to zero.
</p>
<p>At low pressures, the saturation pressure psat(T ) of water can be described
by the Antoine equation

<p>psat(T ) = ptr exp

</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>, (19.11)
</p>
<p>where T is the temperature in ◦C, and ptr = 0.611 kPa is the triple point
pressure.
</p>
<p>To plot the lines of constant φ, Twb, h1+ω and v1+ω, we need, for the given
total pressure p, the humidity ratio ω as a function of the dry-bulb temper-
ature T , and the quantity in question, i.e., relative humidity, enthalpy, etc.
Lines of constant wet-bulb temperature Twb follow immediately by plotting
(19.9), which gives ω (T, Twb, p), for fixed values of Twb and p. Equations
(19.1) and (19.3) can be combined into
</p>
<p>ω (T, φ, p) =
0.622
</p>
<p>1
φ
</p>
<p>p
psat(T )
</p>
<p>&minus; 1 (19.12)
</p>
<p>which, when plotted for fixed φ and p, gives the lines of constant relative
humidity. Solving (19.5) for ω yields
</p>
<p>ω (T, h1+ω) =
h1+ω &minus; ha (T )
</p>
<p>hv (T )
, (19.13)
</p>
<p>which gives the lines of constant enthalpy per unit mass of dry air, h1+ω.
Finally, lines of constant specific volume per unit mass of dry air follow from
(19.6) as
</p>
<p>ω (T, v1+ω, p) =

<p>440 19 Psychrometrics
</p>
<p>The psychrometric chart for p = 0.8 bar of Fig. 19.5 was obtained from
the above equations. The chart exhibits lines of constant enthalpy (h1+ω =
10, 20...120 kJkg ), constant relative humidity (φ = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1), constant wet-
</p>
<p>bulb temperature (Twb = 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, ...32.5
◦C), and of constant specific
</p>
<p>volume (v1+ω = 0.99, 1.00, ..., 1.24). Lines for enthalpy, volume and wet-bulb
temperature have no meaning for φ &gt; 1 and are not drawn. As can be seen
from the equations above, the lines of constant wet-bulb temperature, con-
stant enthalpy h1+ω and constant volume v1+ω are not straight. Their curva-
ture is so small, however, that in the chart they appear to be straight lines.
Also note that enthalpy and wet-bulb temperature lines are not parallel.
</p>
<p>Differences in enthalpy values between diagrams obtained from the equa-
tions above and those commonly distributed could arise due to different ref-
erence states for enthalpies, while enthalpy differences will agree. Figure 19.6
shows a standard ASHRAE3 chart for p = 1.01325 bar; the process depicted
in the chart will be discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p>19.5 Dehumidification
</p>
<p>When moist air is cooled below its dewpoint, water condenses, and the humid-
ity ratio ω drops. This process forms the basis for dehumidification systems,
in which moist air is cooled below the dewpoint, some water condenses, and
then the air is reheated, so that a desired final state is reached, Figure 19.7
shows a schematic for such a process.
</p>
<p>We study the process by means of an example, that also shows how to
use the psychrometric chart. A mass flow ṁa = 10
</p>
<p>kg
s of outside air of state
</p>
<p>1 (T1 = 30
◦C, T 1wb = 22.5
</p>
<p>◦C, p = 1 atm) is to be dehumidified and cooled
so that the final state 4 is T4 = 20
</p>
<p>◦C, φ4 = 0.7. To achieve this state,
the flow is first cooled isobarically. As long as the temperature is above the
dewpoint, the humidity ratio does not change. At state 2 (φ2 = 1), water
starts to condense. The moist air is cooled further to state 3, while some
water condenses. State 3 has the same humidity ratio as the desired final
state 4, which is finally obtained by isobaric heating. The process curve is
shown in the psychrometric chart, Fig. 19.6.
</p>
<p>From the diagram, we read the following data for the process
</p>
<p>ω1 = 0.0145 , ω2 = ω1 , ω3 = ω4 , ω4 = 0.0105 ,

<p>We assume that the liquid water leaves the system at temperature T3 where
it has the enthalpy hf(T3) = cf (T3 &minus; T0) = 60.61 kJkg , see (19.10). The mass
balance for water reads
</p>
<p>ṁ1v = ṁw + ṁ

<p>19.6 Humidification with Steam
</p>
<p>The humidity ratio of dry or moist air can be increased by adding water
either as steam or as liquid at pressure p. Steam injection increases humidity
ratio and temperature, as long as the steam temperature is above the air
temperature. Injection of liquid water, e.g., by spraying of fine mist, leads to
cooling of the air, due to evaporation. We study both processes by means of
examples, beginning with steam.
</p>
<p>We study a steam injection process as depicted in Fig. 19.8. A volume flow

</p>
<p>state (state 2) of the air.
From the psychrometric chart Fig. 19.5 we find the properties of state 1
</p>
<p>as
</p>
<p>ω1 = 0.0032 , φ1 = 0.26 , h

</p>
<p>and the enthalpy of the injected steam follows from (19.10) as hs = 2897

</p>
<p>The mass flow of dry air is ṁa = V̇1/v

1+ω = 9.66
</p>
<p>kg

</p>
<p>For this continuous flow process, the balances for vapor mass and energy
read

</p>
<p>ṁah

1+ω + ṁshs = ṁah

</p>
<p>From these, we find

</p>
<p>With the above values for ω2 and h

<p>and we find the following other properties: φ2 = 0.6, T2 = 20

<p>19.7 Evaporative Cooling
</p>
<p>Next we consider cooling and moisturizing of air by addition of liquid water,
again by means of an example, see Fig. 19.9. The initial state is relatively dry
air at a pressure of p = 1bar, relative humidity φ1 = 0.2, and temperature
T1 = 40
</p>
<p>◦C, so that ω1 = 0.009. Liquid water at Tw = 20 ◦C is sprayed into</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 19.9 Evaporative cooling: Water is sprayed into moist air and evaporates
</p>
<p>the air, and we ask how much liquid must be added per kg of air in order to
lower the temperature to T2 = 30
</p>
<p>◦C. The conservation laws for water mass
and energy for this process read
</p>
<p>ω1ṁa + ṁw = ω2ṁa ,
</p>
<p>ṁah1+ω (T1, ω1) + ṁwhf (Tw) = ṁah1+ω (T2, ω2) . (19.15)
</p>
<p>First, we solve the problem analytically. With the above relations for en-
thalpies (19.5, 19.10) we find
</p>
<p>ω2 &minus; ω1 =
ha (T1)&minus; ha (T2) + ω1 [hv (T1)&minus; hv (T2)]
</p>
<p>hv (T2)&minus; hf (Tw)

</p>
<p>= 4.13
g
</p>
<p>kg
= 0.00413 ,
</p>
<p>and thus ω2 = 0.0131.
When one plots this process into the psychrometric chart, one notices that
</p>
<p>the wet-bulb temperatures of both states are very close. To understand this
behavior, we consider two states α = 1, 2 with the same wet-bulb temperature
Twb so that, from (19.9),
</p>
<p>ha (Twb)+ωsat (Twb) [hv (Twb)&minus;hf (Twb)]=ha (Tα)+ωα [hv (Tα)&minus;hf (Twb)] .
(19.17)
</p>
<p>By taking the difference of this equation for α = 1 and α = 2 we find
</p>
<p>ω2 &minus; ω1 =
ha (T1)&minus; ha (T2) + ω1 [hv (T1)&minus; hv (T2)]
</p>
<p>hv (T2)&minus; hf (Twb)
. (19.18)
</p>
<p>This almost agrees with the expression (19.16), the only difference is the value
of the temperature of the added water in the denominator. If the added liquid
water in (19.16) is at the wet-bulb temperature of state 1, then the wet-bulb
temperature will stay constant. Since under HVAC conditions the enthalpy of
the vapor exceeds the enthalpy of the added liquid by far, the denominators</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.8 Adiabatic Mixing 445
</p>
<p>in (19.16) and (19.18) will be very close, and both equations will give almost
the same result.
</p>
<p>In short, evaporative cooling, that is injection of liquid water into moist
air, can be well approximated as a process of constant wet-bulb temperature.
The psychrometric chart shows lines of constant Twb and can be used to eval-
uate these processes. Moreover, since the lines of constant enthalpy h1+ω are
almost parallel to the lines of constant wet-bulb temperature, some authors
suggest to describe evaporative cooling as a constant enthalpy process.
</p>
<p>19.8 Adiabatic Mixing
</p>
<p>We consider the adiabatic and isobaric mixing of two moist air streams of
states 1 and 2. Mass and energy balances relate the final state 3 to the
incoming streams as

</p>
<p>which implies that in the psychrometric chart the mixed state 3 lies on the
line connecting states 1 and 2, see Fig. 19.10 for illustration.

<p>As an example we consider mixing of two streams at p = 1 atm and

<p>Fig. 19.10 Adiabatic mixing of moist air streams: In the psychrometric chart, the
mixed state 3 is on the line connecting the initial states 1 and 2
</p>
<p>A special situation may arise due to the convexity of the saturation line
(φ = 1). It can happen that the line connecting the two initial states lies
outside the accessible region of the diagram. Figure 19.11 shows this for the
special case of mixing of two saturated states. In these cases, some liquid
water will fall-out as fog, and the mixture will be in the saturated state.
Obviously, formation of fog must be avoided in HVAC applications. The
relevant equations are again the conservation laws for air and vapor mass,
and for energy, which now read

<p>ṁ1a + ṁ

</p>
<p>3
1+ω (T3, ωsat) + ṁwhw (T3) .
</p>
<p>Due to the occurrence of ωsat (T3), these are three non-linear equations for
the three unknowns T3, ṁw, ṁ
</p>
<p>3
a, which are best solved numerically.
</p>
<p>The air on top of water bodies normally is saturated. When two streams of
water at different temperatures meet, fog will occur as a result of the mixing
of the two accompanying air flows.
</p>
<p>19.9 Cooling Towers
</p>
<p>Evaporate cooling is used in cooling towers for steam power plants, which
require a large amount of heat rejection in the condenser. Figure 19.12 shows</p>

</p>
<p>a schematic for a natural draft cooling tower, the hyperbolic shape is chosen
for structural strength and low material use.
</p>
<p>The cooling water flow ṁcw comes from the condenser of the power plant,
where it was heated to T1 while the water circulating in the steam cycle was
condensed. The incoming cooling water is sprayed into the cooling tower,
where some of it evaporates, which leads to cooling of the liquid. Since moist
air is lighter than dry air&mdash;the low molar mass of vapor lowers the average
molar mass&mdash;moist air rises and leaves the tower, while fresh environmental
air at (T3, ω3) is drawn in at the bottom. Make-up water at ṁm, T5 is added
to compensate the loss of evaporated water and the mass flow ṁcw leaves
the cooling tower towards the condenser at T2. Normally, the make-up water
is drawn from rivers or lakes, and that is why power plants are build close
to these. As the rising moist air equilibrates with the environment, some of
the added water might condense, which leads to clouds that normally can be
seen above cooling towers.
</p>
<p>The balances for air and water mass, and for energy, read
</p>
<p>ṁa = const. ,
</p>
<p>ṁcw + ṁm + ṁaω3 = ṁcw + ṁaω4 , (19.21)

</p>
<p>As an example we study the cooling tower for a Ẇ = 300MW power plant
with a thermal efficiency η = 0.4. In the condenser, the cooling water is
heated from T2 = 30
</p>
<p>◦C to T1 = 40 ◦C (the numbers refer to Fig. 19.12), thus
the mass flow of cooling water is</p>

</p>
<p>We ask for the required flows of air and make-up water, which both depend
on the state of the incoming and exiting moist air. For further computation
we assume that the incoming air is at T3 = 25
</p>
<p>◦C, φ3 = 0.5, so that ω3 = 0.01,
h31+ω = 51
</p>
<p>kJ

</p>
<p>◦C, so that, with

<p>(19.10), hf (T5) = 104.5
kJ
kg , and hf (T1) = 167.2
</p>
<p>kJ
kg , hf (T2) = 125.4
</p>
<p>kJ
kg . Fur-
</p>
<p>thermore, we assume that the exiting air is saturated, so that ω4 = ωsat (T4).
The remaining unknowns in this problem are the air mass flow ṁa, the
</p>
<p>make-up water flow ṁm and the exit temperature T4. This problem differs
from evaporative cooling as discussed above, due to the large amount of
warm water sprayed into the air. The heat transfer between air droplets and
air could only be described by a detailed heat transfer analysis. To simplify
the problem, we assume T4 = 30
</p>
<p>◦C which implies h41+ω = 100
kJ
kg and ω4 =
</p>
<p>ωsat (T4) = 0.0272. Then we find from the conservation laws
</p>
<p>ṁa =

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.10 Example: Cooling Tower 449
</p>
<p>The river that provides the make-up water should have a sufficiently large
mass flow rate, so that the removal of the make-up water will not disturb
the ecological equilibrium of the river. An alternative to cooling towers is the
direct use of river or lake water as cooling water. In this case, the heat rejected
by the power plant is added to the river or lake. The related increase in water
temperature changes the chemical environment, e.g., the amount of oxygen
dissolved decreases with increasing temperature (Henry&rsquo;s law, Sec. 22.10),
which might disturb the ecological equilibrium more than the removal of
some water for use in cooling towers.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>19.1. Compression of Moist Air
Air initially at 1 atm, 25 ◦C and relative humidity of 60% is compressed
isothermally until condensation of water occurs. Determine the pressure at
the onset of condensation. Draw the process for the vapor into a T-s-diagram.
</p>
<p>19.2. Compressed Air
To avoid condensation of water in compressed air lines, it might be neces-
sary to dehumidify the compressed air. To study this, consider a compressor
that draws outside air at 93 kPa, 14 ◦C and relative humidity of 40%, and

distribution, where it is cooled to the workshop temperature of 22 ◦C. Deter-
mine the dewpoint of the compressed air&ndash;will there be condensation in the

</p>
<p>An air conditioning system provides a volume flow of 3 m
3
</p>
<p>s of moist air at
1 atm, 22 ◦C and 50% relative humidity by conditioning outside air at 34 ◦C
and 50% relative humidity. For this, the outside air is first cooled and dehu-
midified, and then heated to the final temperature. Assume that the conden-
sate leaves the system at 10 ◦C and determine the temperature after dehu-
midification is completed, the amount of heat that must be withdrawn in the
cooling process, and the heat added in the heating process per unit mass of
dry air.

<p>19.4. Air Conditioning
An air conditioning system provides air at 1 atm, 20 ◦C and 60% relative hu-
midity which is obtained from outside air at 38 ◦C and 70% relative humidity
as follows: The outside air is first cooled and dehumidified, and then heated
to the desired final temperature. The pressure stays constant throughout the
process. Determine the temperature after dehumidification is completed, and
assume that the condensate leaves the system at this temperature. Next, de-
termine the heat that must be withdrawn in the cooling process, and the
heat added in the heating process, both per unit mass of dry air. Finally,</p>

bulb temperatures of the incoming air are 10 ◦C and 2.5 ◦C, respectively. To
reach the desired state, the air is first heated to a temperature T2, and then
humidified by injection of superheated steam at 0.8 bar, 150 ◦C, where the
enthalpy is 2777.84 kJkg . The air leaves the system at 22

supply in the heating section, and the temperature of the air before steam is
injected.
</p>
<p>19.7. Dehumidification and Mixing
The outside air of a building is at 26 ◦C, and 90% relative humidity, the
pressure is 1 atm. The air conditioning system of the building is required to
provide air at 22 ◦C and 50% relative humidity. To reach that state, the flow
of incoming outside air is split into two streams.
</p>
<p>One stream is dehumidified by cooling to 5 ◦C so that liquid water con-
denses, and subsequent reheating. The cooling system removes 6 kW from
this flow.

<p>Then, the dehumidified stream is mixed with the other stream, so that the
desired state is reached.

streams, stream A and stream B. Stream A is first dehumidified by cooling to
5 ◦C (state 2), and then heated to state 3. Stream A and stream B are then
mixed adiabatically. The mixture has a dry-bulb temperature of 20 ◦C at 50%
relative humidity (state 4). The pressure is constant at 1 atm throughout the

In the desert: The outside air of a building is at 40oC, and 10% relative
humidity, the pressure is 1 atm. The air conditioning system of the building
is required to provide air at 20 ◦C and 50% relative humidity. To reach that
state, the flow of incoming outside air is split into two streams, A and B:
</p>
<p>Stream A is spray-cooled by injection of liquid water to a relative humidity
of 100%, the mass flow of water (at 20 ◦C) injected is 10 kgh .

<p>19.14. Cooling Tower
In a 500MW steam power plant, the condenser is cooled by a cooling water
flow that enters the condenser at 26 ◦C, and leaves at 40 ◦C. The cooling
water is cooled back to 26 ◦C in a natural-draft cooling tower which draws
environmental air at 1 atm with dry- and wet-bulb temperatures of 23 ◦C
and 18 ◦C, respectively, and discharges saturated air at 37 ◦C. The thermal
efficiency of the power plant is 43.5%. Determine mass flow of cooling water,
volume flows of air into and out of the cooling tower, and the required mass
flow of makeup water.
</p>
<p>19.15. Clouds
Cumulus clouds are formed when air at the ground is heated, takes up mois-
ture, and then rises due to its buoyancy. While rising, the moist air expands,
more or less adiabatically, since the pressure decreases with height. During
expansion the temperature of the rising air is decreasing. When the tempera-
ture reaches the dew point temperature, water vapor condenses, and a cloud
is formed.
</p>
<p>In order to compute the height of the clouds, assume that the pressure in
the atmosphere is given by the barometric formula 2.26.
</p>
<p>Consider a fixed mass of moist air, that occupies a volume V , and has
enthalpy H . Consider the moist air as an ideal gas, so that its enthalpy and
volume are given as

<p>The Chemical Potential
</p>
<p>20.1 Definition and Interpretation
</p>
<p>Changes in the composition of the mixture, either by addition or removal of
components or by reaction, change the properties of the mixture, in particular
the Gibbs free energy. A straightforward extension of the Gibbs equation
which accounts for the change of Gibbs free energy with varying composition
is
</p>
<p>dG = &minus;SdT + V dp+
ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>&micro;̄αdnα , (20.1)
</p>
<p>where the new quantity &micro;̄α is the chemical potential. We have by definition,

<p>&part;G
</p>
<p>&part;nγ
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>T,p,nα(α 
=γ)
. (20.2)
</p>
<p>The chemical potential is of fundamental importance in the thermody-
namics of inert and reacting mixtures. To understand its physical meaning,
we consider two mixtures of different composition and different pressures
but equal temperatures T , which are divided by a semi-permeable membrane
that only allows component γ to pass, as depicted in Fig. 20.1. Since pressure
and temperature are controlled, we know that in equilibrium the Gibbs free
energy of the system must assume a minimum,
</p>
<p>G &minus;&rarr; Minimum . (20.3)
</p>
<p>The total Gibbs free energy of the system is the sum of the Gibbs free
energies of the two parts I and II of the system, which depend only on the
pressure, temperature and mole numbers within their portion of the system,

</p>
<p>Just as the continuity of temperature at diathermic walls allows us to measure
temperature, the continuity of the chemical potential at semi-permeable walls
allows us its measurement, at least in principle. And just as temperature
differences lead to heat flow and allow for power generation, differences in
chemical potential cause particle flow and allow for power generation, as will
be discussed in Section 20.7.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the chemical potential is a rather abstract quantity, and we
need to study it further, and relate it to quantities we are more familiar with.
</p>
<p>20.2 Properties of the Chemical Potential
</p>
<p>The Gibbs free energy G (T, p, nβ) is an extensive quantity, which implies
that it is a homogeneous function of mole number,
</p>
<p>zG (T, p, nβ) = G (T, p, znβ) . (20.8)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.2 Properties of the Chemical Potential 457
</p>
<p>We take the derivative of the above with respect to z, to obtain
</p>
<p>G (T, p, nβ) =
</p>
<p>ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>&part;G (T, p, znβ)
</p>
<p>&part; (znα)
</p>
<p>d (znα)
</p>
<p>dz
</p>
<p>=
</p>
<p>ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>&part;G (T, p, znβ)
</p>
<p>&part; (znα)
nα =
</p>
<p>ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>&micro;̄α (T, p, znβ)nα . (20.9)
</p>
<p>This must hold for all z. Since the left hand side is independent of z, the
right hand side should not depend on z as well. This is so, when the chemical
potential does not depend on all mole numbers nβ, but only on quotients like
the mole ratio Xβ , which is independent of z, since Xβ (nγ) =
</p>
<p>nβ
n , so that
</p>
<p>Xβ (znγ) = Xβ (nγ). Thus we have
</p>
<p>&micro;̄α = &micro;̄α (T, p,Xβ) . (20.10)
</p>
<p>With this we obtain from (20.9)
</p>
<p>G (T, p, nβ) =
</p>
<p>ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>nα&micro;̄α (T, p,Xβ) . (20.11)
</p>
<p>According to (20.11), in a mixture the total Gibbs free energy is the sum of
the component mole numbers times their chemical potentials, G =
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>nα&micro;̄α.
Since
</p>
<p>G = H &minus; TS =

<p>nα
(
</p>
<p>h̄α &minus; T s̄α
)
</p>
<p>, (20.12)
</p>
<p>this implies that the chemical potential is the specific Gibbs free energy of
the component in the mixture, in the sense that
</p>
<p>&micro;̄α (T, p,Xβ) = h̄α (T, p,Xβ)&minus; T s̄α (T, p,Xβ) . (20.13)
</p>
<p>Here, h̄α (T, p,Xβ) and s̄α (T, p,Xβ) are the specific enthalpy and entropy of
component α in the mixture at temperature T , pressure p, and composition
Xβ .
</p>
<p>The molar Gibbs free energy of the mixture is defined as
</p>
<p>ḡ =
G
</p>
<p>n
=
</p>
<p>ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>Xα&micro;̄α (T, p,Xβ) . (20.14)
</p>
<p>For a single substance the chemical potential is equal to the molar Gibbs free
energy,
</p>
<p>G = nḡ = n&micro;̄ so that &micro;̄ (T, p) = ḡ (T, p) . (20.15)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>458 20 The Chemical Potential
</p>
<p>For this reason, one sometimes finds the specific Gibbs free energy denoted
as the chemical potential. For the description of the component, it is useful
to distinguish between the Gibbs free energy ḡα (T, p) that describes the
component α alone at (T, p) and the chemical potential &micro;̄α (T, p,Xβ) that
describes the component α in a mixture at (T, p) with mole fractions Xβ ,
β = 1, . . . , ν.

<p>Since the order of derivatives can be exchanged, we have the symmetry
property

<p>20.3 Gibbs and Gibbs-Duhem Equations
</p>
<p>We revisit the Gibbs equation for the mixture (20.1),
</p>
<p>dG = &minus;SdT + V dp+
ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>&micro;̄αdnα . (20.17)
</p>
<p>The Gibbs equation for molar quantities of the mixture follows by setting
G = nḡ, S = ns̄, V = nv̄ and nα = nXα as
</p>
<p>dḡ = &minus;s̄dT + v̄dp+
ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>&micro;̄αdXα . (20.18)
</p>
<p>Alternative forms of the Gibbs equation can be obtained through Legendre
transforms, which yield, e.g.,
</p>
<p>Tds̄ = dū + pdv̄ &minus;
ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>&micro;̄αdXα . (20.19)
</p>
<p>As discussed in Sec. 16.2, the Gibbs equation leads to Maxwell relations,
such as

<p>20.5 The Chemical Potential for an Ideal Mixture
</p>
<p>The Gibbs free energy of an ideal mixture at (T, p) is given by
</p>
<p>G =
</p>
<p>ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>

</p>
<p>where
&sum;
</p>
<p>α nαḡα is the Gibbs free energy of the unmixed state, and Hmix &minus;
TSmix is the Gibbs free energy of mixing. For the ideal mixture Hmix = 0,
and Smix is given by (18.26) so that
</p>
<p>G =

<p>α=1

&sum;
</p>
<p>α=1
</p>
<p>nα lnXα . (20.35)
</p>
<p>Thus the chemical potential of the ideal mixture is the sum of the Gibbs free
energy of the component alone at mixing conditions (T, p) plus a contribution
from the entropy of mixing,
</p>
<p>&micro;̄α (T, p,Xβ) = ḡα (T, p) + R̄T lnXα . (20.36)
</p>
<p>20.6 The Chemical Potential for an Ideal Gas Mixture
</p>
<p>Using that g = h &minus; Ts and the property relations for the ideal gas, the
chemical potential of an ideal gas is
</p>
<p>&micro;̄α (T, p,Xβ) = h̄α (T )&minus; T s̄0α (T ) + R̄T ln
Xαp
</p>
<p>p0
. (20.37)
</p>
<p>As an example we study two ideal gas mixtures at
(
</p>
<p>T, pI
)
</p>
<p>and
(
</p>
<p>T, pII
)
</p>
<p>,
separated by a semi-permeable membrane that only allows component ν to
pass. The equilibrium condition (20.7) is
</p>
<p>&micro;̄ν
(
</p>
<p>T, pI, XIβ
)
</p>
<p>= &micro;̄ν
(
</p>
<p>T, pII, X IIβ
)
</p>
<p>, (20.38)
</p>
<p>and evaluation with (20.37) gives
</p>
<p>X Iνp
I = X IIν p
</p>
<p>II . (20.39)
</p>
<p>Thus, we find the intuitive result that for an ideal gas the partial pressure
pν = Xνp is continuous at the ideal semipermeable membrane. This means,
that the component that can pass the membrane behaves as if the mem-
brane is not present, it is homogeneously distributed over the entire accessible
volume.</p>

</p>
<p>We consider the set-up shown in Fig. 20.2: Two reservoirs I and II contain
mixtures of different temperature T , pressure p, and composition Xα, which
remain constant at all times. Through semipermeable membranes the two
reservoirs are connected to a heat and mass conducting duct. Due to the
non-equilibrium between the two reservoirs we expect flows of mass and heat.
The duct might contain devices to extract work from these flows.

<p>Power can be generated from the differences in temperature and chemical

differences, in great detail in previous chapters. The generation of power from

</p>
<p>As before, in Sec. 4.10, we interpret the entropy generation in terms of
thermodynamic forces and fluxes. The forces are the differences in reduced
</p>
<p>chemical potential,
[
</p>
<p>&micro;̄Iγ
T I &minus;
</p>
<p>&micro;̄IIγ

<p>, and inverse temperature,
[
</p>
<p>1
T II &minus; 1T I
</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>, between
</p>
<p>the reservoirs. The related fluxes are the matter flow ṅγ and the total energy
</p>
<p>flow
(
</p>
<p>ṅγ h̄
I
γ + Q̇
</p>
<p>I
)
</p>
<p>. Previously, when we discussed Newton&rsquo;s law of cooling,
</p>
<p>we had only one flux-force pair, and set the flux proportional to the force.
For the present setting, we have two such pairs, which offers a richer set of
transport laws. Indeed, we allow for both forces to affect both fluxes, and write
fluxes and forces as vectors, with a matrix of coefficients αij ,
</p>
<p>⎡

</p>
<p>⎦
. (20.43)
</p>
<p>As always, we made the transfer surface A explicit. To ensure positive entropy
generation, the matrix of transport coefficients αij must be positive definite,
which is the case for α11 &gt; 0 and α11α22 &minus; α12α21 &gt; 0.
</p>
<p>We note that transfer of matter does not only occur due to differences in
pressure (typical flow), and composition (diffusion), but also in response to
a temperature gradient (thermodiffusion, or Soret effect, Charles Soret 1854-
1904) ). Heat transfer does not only occur due to a temperature difference,
but also due to differences in pressure or composition (Dufour effect, Louis
Dufour 1832-1892).
</p>
<p>A deep discussion of laws of this type reveals the Onsager reciprocity
relations (Lars Onsager, 1903-1976), which for this case state that the matrix
must be symmetric, α21 = α21. Careful experiments show that the so-called
cross effects, which are described by the off-diagonal terms in the matrix, are
less important than the direct effects, which are described by the diagonal
terms. In engineering applications the cross effects are often ignored.1

<p>1 The arguments we use here are typical in the field of Non-equilibrium Thermo-
dynamics. A thorough yet accessible introduction into this topic is presented in:

namics for Engineers, World Scientific, Singapore 2010.</p>

</p>
<p>When the flow ṅγ goes from I to II as shown, the reduced chemical potential
&micro;̄Iγ
T I must be larger than
</p>
<p>&micro;̄IIγ
T II . In other words, a difference in chemical potential
</p>
<p>causes a flow against the gradient of the (reduced) chemical potential.
When we ignore temperature differences (T I = T II = T ), we can expect a

<p>where κ = α11/T is a positive constitutive coefficient, and A is the cross
section of the duct.

</p>
<p>: there will be a particle
</p>
<p>flux unless both mole fractions are equilibrated.
In short, the desire to equilibrate the chemical potential leads to a flux
</p>
<p>of that component that can pass the duct. The flux direction is against the
gradient, which reduces the gradient. According to Eq. (20.41), this flux can
be used to produce power Ẇ &gt; 0. Inversion of the flux, that is forcing flow
in the direction of the gradient, requires power input, Ẇ &lt; 0. This is fully
equivalent to what we have seen on temperature differences: Heat will flow
from hot to cold&mdash;against the gradient&mdash;by itself, and this heat flux can be
used to produce power in a heat engine. Transferring heat from cold to hot&mdash;
in the direction of the gradient&mdash;requires work input, i.e., a heat pump.

<p>The word &ldquo;osmosis&rdquo; comes from the greek word for pushing and refers to the

<p>The osmotic pressure is the pressure on the membrane due to those compo-
nents of the mixture that cannot pass. Specifically, we consider a membrane
which separates the pure solvent ν at pressure pps from an ideal mixture at
pressure ps, see Fig. 21.1. The osmotic pressure is defined as the pressure
difference over the membrane in equilibrium,
</p>
<p>posm = ps &minus; pps . (21.1)

<p>The dissolved substances in a dilute solution exert an ideal gas pressure on
the membrane; the osmotic pressure is the sum of these ideal gas pressures.
</p>
<p>21.3 Example: Pfeffer Tube
</p>
<p>An instructive example for the strength of the osmotic forces is the Pfeffer
tube (Wilhelm Pfeffer, 1845-1920), depicted in Fig. 21.2. The solvent is water.
A tube is closed by a membrane that only lets the solvent ν pass, and is set
vertically into a bath of solvent. Some solvent will pass the membrane, so
that the solvent inside and outside the tube are at the same level. Then salt
is added to the tube. This leads to an additional amount of solvent drawn
from the bath into the tube; in the final equilibrium, the osmotic pressure
and the hydrostatic pressure are balanced.
</p>
<p>Since this is a system in which temperature and (environmental) pressure
are controlled, the total Gibbs free energy G = H &minus;TS+Epot of the system
will minimize. Drawing solvent into the tube increases the entropy of the

<p>dissolved particles, which now have a greater volume to access, but also in-
creases the potential energy. The final equilibrium state, a balance of height
increasing entropic force and height reducing energetic force, will be calcu-
lated next under some simplifying assumptions. The goal is the computation
of the height H1 in the tube.
</p>
<p>Directly at the membrane, the hydrostatic pressures of the solution in the
tube and solvent in the bath are
</p>
<p>ps = p0 + ρsgH1 , pps = p0 + ρνgH2 ,
</p>
<p>and these are balanced by the osmotic pressure, so that

<p>21.4 Desalination in a Continuous Process 471
</p>
<p>When the tube is immersed into the pure solvent by H2 = 1 cm, the
solution in the tube will reach a height of H1 = 9.29m, which corresponds
to about 1 litre of water in the tube! This shows the enormous forces that
are present in osmosis, which are due to the desire of the salt to increase the
entropy of mixing by making the accessible volume (i.e., the volume of the
solution), as large as possible.
</p>
<p>Due to the difference in density between salt solution and pure water, the
height H1 becomes smaller as the tube is pushed deeper into the solvent (i.e.,
for larger H2), as the problems show, it might even happen that H2 &gt; H1.
</p>
<p>The strong desire of the salt to draw water can be used (and was widely
used in the past) to cure meat: While water can pass cell membranes, salt
cannot, and thus a piece of meat or fish immersed in salt will be depleted
from some water. The same is true for bacteria on the meat which will die
from dehydration, and thus cannot spoil the meat.
</p>
<p>Since seawater contains more salt than the cells of the human body, drink-
ing seawater is deadly: The seawater will draw water from the cells, which
will be damaged by dehydration. In fact, after drinking seawater one will be
more thirsty than before.
</p>
<p>Another example for osmotic forces is putting sugar on strawberries, which
will draw water (juice) out of the strawberries that mixes with the sugar. The
opposite can be seen when raisins are put into water: the sugar inside the
raisin draws water in, and the raisin swells.
</p>
<p>21.4 Desalination in a Continuous Process
</p>
<p>In the previous section we have seen that salt can draw water through a
semipermeable membrane. In the inverse process, fresh water is obtained
from saltwater, by pressing the saltwater against a semipermeable membrane,
which only allows freshwater to pass, e.g., think of increasing the pressure
on the saltwater column in the Pfeffer tube. We ask for the minimum work
required for desalination, that is for the work required in a reversible process.
</p>
<p>Figure 21.3 shows the general set-up for a continuous desalination plant,
without specifying how desalination is taking place inside the plant, which is
drawn as a grey box. A mole flow ṅsw of salt water with salt mole fraction
Xsw enters the plant at environmental pressure and temperature (p0, T0).
Work Ẇ is supplied to the plant, which also exchanges heat Q̇ with the
environment. Two streams leave the plant at (p0, T0), a stream of freshwater
ṅfw, and the brine stream ṅb which contains all salt and has a salt mole
fraction Xb &gt; Xsw.</p>

<p>This is a best case scenario, where the streams entering and leaving the
plant are in thermal (T0) and mechanical (p0) equilibrium with the environ-
ment. The following calculation will assume reversible processes, and thus
the actual work that a real plant requires will be larger. It is the task of
the engineer to design a process that uses as little work as possible, and the
calculation of the minimum work will serve as an important guideline on the
quality of the actual process devised.

<p>Figure 21.4 shows the work required as function of the freshwater ratio y.
For smaller values of y the increase in work requirement is not too large, and

<p>of y reduce the amount of seawater drawn for a given amount of freshwater
produced, and thus the overall size of the device or plant. As y approaches
the maximum value, we observe fast increase of the work requirement.
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.4 Work required per litre of seawater over freshwater/seawater ratio y
</p>
<p>The work requirement will be larger in actual processes, where additional
work input is needed to overcome irreversible losses. For a membrane-based
desalination system there are losses to friction in the pipes, the pump, in
filters, and as water is pressed through the membrane, and losses due to non-
uniform salt concentration: salt might accumulate in front of the membrane
and this concentration polarization increases the local osmotic pressure and
thus the work requirement. Note that less work is needed when reverse os-
mosis takes place at lower temperatures, where the osmotic pressure is lower.
Typical values for separation work in commercial membrane desalination sys-
tems are about 10 kJ per litre of freshwater.

<p>21.5 Reversible Mixing: Osmotic Power Generation
</p>
<p>Rivers transport freshwater into the sea, where freshwater and saltwater mix.
The difference in salt content can be used to drive osmotic power plants.
</p>
<p>An intuitive basic set-up is to enclose saltwater in a piston-cylinder system
and bring it into contact with the freshwater via a semipermeable membrane.
The saltwater will draw freshwater into the cylinder to increase its entropy,
the piston will be pushed and work is done. Note that, in principle, the salt
inside the cylinder can draw an infinite amount of freshwater! Alternatively,
one can enclose the freshwater in the cylinder and bring it into contact with
the seawater via a semipermeable membrane. The saltwater will draw fresh-
water out of the cylinder to increase its entropy, the piston will be pulled in
and work is done.</p>

verting the continuous desalination process discussed in the previous section,
see Fig. 21.5. To be able to use the same notation, we consider the reversible
mixing of brine (ṅb, Xb) and freshwater (ṅfw, Xfw = 1) to saltwater (ṅsw,
Xsw); for mixing of seawater and river water, Xb is the composition of the
seawater.

versible, case per litre of freshwater for Xb = 0.0218 (which is the value for
seawater) at T = 5 ◦C. The maximum work (2.8 kJlitre) could be obtained by
reversibly mixing the freshwater with an infinite amount of seawater (limit
x &rarr; 0). When even amounts of salt- and freshwater are mixed (x = 1),
one still could produce 1.9 kJlitre . The river Rhine, Germany&rsquo;s largest river,
</p>
<p>discharges in average a volume flow of 2200 m

</p>
<p>s . The power potential of an os-
motic power plant that uses 1/10 of the volume flow and operates at x = 1 is
Ẇpot = 418MW. There are many rivers with large
</p>
<p>1 or small discharge, which
in principle offer a tremendous potential for regenerative energy production
(driven by weather processes, i.e., the sun). Not all locations will be suitable,
and a feasible technology that operates on large and small scales would be
helpful.
</p>
<p>Particular care must be taken in keeping the osmotic pressure of the in-
coming seawater high. Normally the freshwater discharged from a river into
the ocean will mix with the local seawater, and the mixture in front of the
river mouth will have a lower salt content, and therefore lower osmotic pres-
sure, than the ocean far away. This implies that the mixture that leaves the
osmotic power plant must be discharged at some distance from the origin of
the saltwater entering the plant.

<p>21.6 Example: Desalination in Piston-Cylinder Device 477
</p>
<p>The Norwegian company Statkraft (www.statkraft.com) is developing a
power plant based on the concept of pressure retarded osmosis, see Fig. 21.7.
The process relies on the fact that seawater pressurized to a pressure
psw between the environmental and the osmotic pressure of the seawater,
(psw &minus; p0) &lt; posm, draws freshwater at the environmental pressure p0 through
a semipermeable membrane. This increases the flow of pressurized brackish
(lower salt content than seawater) water, which is split into two streams.
The first stream runs through a turbine to produce power, while the other
stream is used to pressurize the incoming seawater in a pressure exchanger.
The relative amount of freshwater, i.e., x in the above calculation, depends
on the pressure psw. In reversible operation, as soon as the osmotic pressure
of the brackish water, which decreases due to dilution, has reached the value
(psw &minus; p0), no further freshwater is drawn in. Irreversible pressure losses in
pipes and pressure exchanger will reduce the amount of power produced.

<p>21.7 Example: Removal of CO2
</p>
<p>The effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on Earth&rsquo;s climate is widely
discussed. One of the solutions to at least reduce the impact of burning carbon
fuels is to remove CO2 from the combustion product, compress it, and and
store it in depleted gas or oil reservoirs below ground (CCS - carbon capture
and storage). As an alternative, it is sometimes suggested to remove CO2 from
the atmosphere. This is a less viable alternative, since the concentration of
CO2 in the atmosphere is very low, which makes it more costly to remove it,
as will be seen below.
</p>
<p>2 Assuming ideal mixture. As said before, this assumption is only valid for low salt
concentrations. The computation of Vs is an extrapolation, and Vs should be seen
as a useful abbreviation.</p>

<p>480 21 Mixing and Separation
</p>
<p>In the oxy-fuel process, oxygen is separated from air, then mixed with
fuel and a portion of the power plant&rsquo;s exhaust, then the mixture is burned
to provide heat for power production. The exhaust is only CO2 and water,
which can be separated rather easily by condensation of water. Since the
concentration of oxygen in the air is far higher than the concentration of
CO2 in air, the separation work for O2 is lower in comparison.
</p>
<p>To estimate the work requirements, we consider air as a mixture of &ldquo;gas&rdquo;
(no need to specify the composition), and carbon dioxide or oxygen with mole
fraction X and ask for the work required per mole of CO2 or O2 to reduce
the mole fraction in the air to X̂ = αX . For the computation we consider a
given amount nair of air at (T, p), and a fully reversible separation process.
The total amount of air is
</p>
<p>nair = ngas + ns ,
</p>
<p>where ns is the number of moles of the component to be separated (CO2 or
O2) in the air, and ngas is the number of moles of all other gases in the air.
</p>
<p>Since all contributing gases are ideal, and since the temperature remains
constant, the first law just gives that the work for separation is equal to the
heat that must be removed,
</p>
<p>W12 = Q12 .
</p>
<p>The second law for the reversible process gives
</p>
<p>S2 &minus; S1 =
Q12
T
</p>
<p>;
</p>
<p>thus the separation work is
</p>
<p>W12 = T (S2 &minus; S1) .
</p>
<p>Since total pressure and temperature remain unchanged, only the mixing
contributions to entropy are relevant.
</p>
<p>In state 1, before separation, we have ngas moles of &ldquo;gas&rdquo; mixed with
ns =
</p>
<p>X
1&minus;Xngas moles of CO2 (or O2). In state 2 we have ngas moles of &ldquo;gas&rdquo;
</p>
<p>mixed with n̂s =
X̂
</p>
<p>1&minus;X̂ngas moles of CO2 (or O2), and [ns &minus; n̂s] moles of pure
separated CO2 (or O2). The corresponding mixing contributions to entropy
are

X is larger, is cheaper.
</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to look at some numbers: Removal of CO2 from atmo-
spheric air, where3 XCO2 = 400 ppm, requires a reversible separation work
of {19.6, 20.2, 21.3} kJmol for α = {0.9, 0.5, 0.1}. On the other hand, removal
of O2 from atmospheric air, where XO2 = 0.21 = 210000 ppm, requires a re-
versible separation work of approximately {3.99, 4.59, 5.54} kJmol , that is just
a quarter of the work required for CO2.
</p>
<p>The Virgin Earth Challenge4 asks for the removal of one billion metric tons
of carbon dioxide per year, that is 2.273&times; 1010 kmolyear . This would require&mdash;in
form of work!&mdash; 4.5 &times; 1014 kJyear at least (in a fully reversible process), that
is about 0.1 percent of the world&rsquo;s energy consumption of 16TW = 5 &times;
1017 kJyear , and about 0.6 percent of the world&rsquo;s power generation of 2.3TW =
</p>
<p>7.2&times; 1016 kJyear . The world&rsquo;s yearly emissions of CO2 are ca. 30&times; 1012
kg
</p>
<p>year or
</p>
<p>6.8 &times; 1011 kmolyear . The minimum (!) work requirement for the removal of this
amount directly from the atmosphere is 1.45&times; 1016 kJyear&mdash;about 2.9% of the
world&rsquo;s energy consumption, and 20% of the world&rsquo;s power generation.

<p>482 21 Mixing and Separation
</p>
<p>The reversible separation of oxygen (XO2 = 0.21) requires only about
5 kJmol , and thus the cost of oxygen separation is lower by approximately a
factor of four. Note that one oxygen molecule is required to form one CO2
molecule in combustion.
</p>
<p>Obviously, additional cost occurs for compressing, pumping and storing of
the removed carbon dioxide, and, most importantly, for overcoming the irre-
versibilities in the separation process. Thus, it might be that the separation
cost is only a small part of the bill&mdash;only a careful cost analysis can show the
relative importance of the various cost factors.5
</p>
<p>Indeed, an important cost factor that must not be forgotten is the oc-
currence of irreversible losses in the separation process. After all, the above
calculation only considers the reversible limit for separation work. The actual
amount of losses will depend strongly on the process chosen for separation,
and we can only make some general estimates.
</p>
<p>It is a reasonable assumption that the work loss for separation of one mole
of CO2 (or of O2, in the case of the oxy-fuel process) is proportional to the
amount of air that must be moved through the separation plant and to the
work w̄p (X,α) required to move and process the incoming air in the plant.
</p>
<p>To proceed, we need to estimate w̄p (X,α). The process through the sep-
aration plant is a flow process and we can estimate the processing work as
</p>
<p>w̄p = v̄0∆p ,
</p>
<p>where v̄0 is the molar volume of the air at environmental conditions. The
overall pressure loss∆p is associated with the actual transport and separation
process; examples are the pressure difference required to press the air through
a semipermeable membrane as given by Darcy&rsquo;s law, or the pressure difference
required to transport air over larger distances, which is necessary to remove
the depleted air far from the plant, so that re-circulation of depleted air is
minimized. With the ideal gas law we obtain
</p>
<p>w̄p = R̄T0
∆p
</p>
<p>p0
.
</p>
<p>Based on the above, the work to overcome irreversible losses required per
mole of gas separated can be estimated as
</p>
<p>w̄irr =
ngas + ns
ns &minus; n̂s
</p>
<p>w̄p (X,α) =
1&minus; αX
(1&minus; α)X R̄T0
</p>
<p>∆p (X,α)
</p>
<p>p0
.
</p>
<p>Due to the low CO2 content of air, one needs to move about 550 times more
air through a separation plant to remove one mole of CO2, than one would
need to remove one mole of O2 for the oxy-fuel process. For α = 0.5 the value
</p>
<p>for the work to overcome irreversible losses is 12990∆p(X,α)p0

Figure 21.10 compares w̄irr for X = 390 ppm (the CO2 fraction in air in

</p>
<p>small α a larger amount of CO2 or O2 is removed), for
∆p(X,α)
</p>
<p>p0
= 0.01.
</p>
<p>Already for this small pressure loss, the loss to irreversible work for taking
CO2 directly from the air is about 5 times the reversible work for separation,
so that the overall work would be about 6 times the reversible work! Presently,
no technology exists that would even reach this value.
</p>
<p>Obviously, the actual values for w̄irr will depend on the pressure losses
∆p (X,α) for the actual process devised. One will expect higher pressure
losses for smaller gas content X and larger extraction ratio, i.e. smaller α.

</p>
<p>The separation processes discussed earlier in this chapter rely on membrane
separation. For a membrane that allows only one component to pass, we can
see from (20.39) that the pressure ratio over the membrane must be (X IIν = 1
for the pure separated gas)
</p>
<p>pI
</p>
<p>pII
&gt;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>X Iν
.
</p>
<p>With XCO2 = 400 ppm this implies a pressure ratio larger than 2500, while
for O2 separation, the pressure ratio must be only above 5. Clearly, while
membrane separation might be feasible for O2, it is not at all feasible for CO2
removal from air. Not only would the large pressure ratio require extremely
sturdy membrane materials, but the creation of huge pressure ratios will lead
to huge irreversible losses.
</p>
<p>Thus, chemical processes must be considered, where the air passes over a
substance A that is keen to react with the CO2 to form An-CO2 compounds.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>484 21 Mixing and Separation
</p>
<p>In a subsequent step, the reaction product must be split into A and CO2 to
dispose the CO2 and re-use the A.
</p>
<p>Another alternative is separation by distillation as discussed in the next
chapter. This requires cooling and partial liquefaction of air. All known large-
scale cooling processes involve substantial irreversibilities in compressors,
throttling valves, heat exchangers, also through heat leaks, and, again, the
actual work required will be substantially bigger than the reversible work.

past a semipermeable membrane, which allows only fresh water to pass. The
exiting brine drives a turbine, and leaves the system at 1 bar. Assume that the
temperature remains constant throughout the device, and that all processes
are reversible.</p>

Some carbon dioxide is to be separated from a mixture of nitrogen and carbon
dioxide with mole fraction XCO2 = 0.0205. For this, the mixture is pressur-
ized to a pressure of 50 bar, and then flows past a membrane, which allows
only CO2 to pass. The CO2 pressure on the back of the membrane is 1 bar.
Determine:
</p>
<p>1. The mole fraction of CO2 in the exiting mixture, in the best case.
2. The percentage of CO2 separated from the mixture.
3. The change of the entropy of mixing.

<p>21.20. Removal of Carbon Dioxide from the Atmosphere
From http://www.virginearth.com/ (2007): The Virgin Earth Challenge is
a prize of $25m for whoever can demonstrate to the judges&rsquo; satisfaction a
commercially viable design which results in the removal of anthropogenic,
atmospheric greenhouse gases so as to contribute materially to the stability
of Earth&rsquo;s climate. From Wikipedia: The prize will be awarded to the first
scheme that is capable of removing one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere per year for 10 years.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s evaluate the goal thermodynamically, by computing how much work
is necessary.
</p>
<p>1. The Earth radius is 6370 km, the pressure at ground level is 1.01325 bar and
the gravitational acceleration is 9.81 ms2 . Estimate mass and mole number
of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.
</p>
<p>2. In January 2014, the mole fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere was
397.80ppm, up from 393.14ppm in January 2012 (data from http://
co2now.org/). The pre-industrial level was 284ppm. Determine mole num-
ber and mass of CO2 in the atmosphere, the amount added in the past
year, and the amount added since industrialization began.
</p>
<p>3. The yearly emissions from fossil fuels and cement production are 33.5Gt
of CO2. Compare this number to the amount added to the atmosphere
computed above. Where is the remaining CO2 going?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.7 Example: Removal of CO2 491
</p>
<p>4. Assume that there is a winner of the competition, the device is built, and
1 billion tons of CO2 are removed in one year. Determine the new mole
fraction of CO2 after the year.
</p>
<p>5. Compute the minimum work required to remove 10 billion tons from the
atmosphere per year (assume T = 290K and January 2014 composition),
and compare to the world energy consumption of about 16TW, and the
world generation of electric power of about 2.5TW. Also compute the
minimum work required to remove the amount added to the atmosphere
per year. To simplify, consider a binary mixture of &lsquo;air molecules&rsquo; and CO2
molecules.
</p>
<p>6. Discuss all results and also the question of irreversibilities in the processes.</p>

<p>Phase Equilibrium in Mixtures
</p>
<p>22.1 Phase Mixtures
</p>
<p>In this chapter we discuss equilibria between mixtures in different phases, e.g.
liquid-vapor equilibria, or liquid-solid equilibria. Phase mixtures normally are
characterized by different mole fractions (or concentrations) in the different
phases. We shall discuss phase diagrams, changes of melting and evaporation
temperatures in solutions, distillation processes, and gas solubility.
</p>
<p>22.2 Gibbs&rsquo; Phase Rule
</p>
<p>In extension to our previous notation we introduce Latin superscripts to de-
note the phases, and we assume that we have f different phases. For instance
Xjα (α = 1, . . . , ν, j = 1, , . . . , f) denotes the mole fraction of component α
</p>
<p>in phase j. Also, &micro;jα
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>T, p,Xjβ
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>is the chemical potential of component α in
</p>
<p>phase j; note that the chemical potential depends only on the mole fractions
of the same phase.
</p>
<p>For each phase, the mole fractions sum to unity, that is
</p>
<p>ν
&sum;
</p>
<p>β=1
</p>
<p>Xjβ = 1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , f . (22.1)
</p>
<p>It follows that a mixture with ν components in f phases is characterized by
(ν &minus; 1) f independent mole fractions. In addition, pressure p and temperature
T are variables, so that the mixture is characterized by (ν &minus; 1) f+2 intensive
variables,
</p>
<p>{
</p>
<p>p, T,Xjα
}
</p>
<p>.
Phase boundaries are permeable interfaces between phases that allow all
</p>
<p>components to pass, and thus in equilibrium the chemical potentials of all
components must be continuous between any two phases,

<p>494 22 Phase Equilibrium in Mixtures
</p>
<p>These equations are known as Gibbs&rsquo; phase rule, and they give (f &minus; 1) ν
conditions1 that restrict the (ν &minus; 1) f + 2 variables. The difference between
these numbers gives the number of degrees of freedom for the system,
</p>
<p>F = [(ν &minus; 1) f + 2]&minus; [(f &minus; 1) ν] = 2 + ν &minus; f . (22.3)
</p>
<p>That is, we can freely chose F properties of the mixture, while the remaining
(f &minus; 1) ν properties are then fixed through Gibbs&rsquo; phase rule.
</p>
<p>We consider this rule for the simple example of a single component, where
ν = 1. The variables are (p, T ) and we find F = 3&minus; f .
</p>
<p>In a single phase, we have f = 1, so that there are F = 2 degrees of
freedom: p and T can be chosen independently.
</p>
<p>When there are two phases, either liquid-vapor, liquid-solid, or vapor-solid,
we have f = 2, so that there is only one degree of freedom, F = 1: pressure
and temperature cannot be chosen independently, but are dependent. The
sole equilibrium condition &micro;1 (p, T ) = &micro;2 (p, T ) defines the saturation pressure
psat (T ).
</p>
<p>For three phases to coexist, we have f = 3, so that F = 0: this is possible
only at one pair of values (p, T )tr&mdash;the triple point.

<p>Our goal is to simplify the phase rule by using constitutive equations for
incompressible liquids and ideal gases, respectively. Deviations from this ide-

assumptions:
</p>
<p>1. The liquids are ideal mixtures, so that

3. The vapor can be described as a mixture of ideal gases, so that, since

<p>The equations (22.12, 22.13) can be numerically solved for T ; this requires
equations or tables for the saturation pressures psatα (T ). The resulting T-X-
diagram for constant pressure is sketched in Fig. 22.3. The interpretation of
the diagram follows the same lines as for the p-X-diagram: For temperatures
above both saturation temperatures T satα (p), e.g., T7, the mixture will be
pure vapor for all values X1. The mixture will be pure liquid for temperatures
below both saturation temperatures, e.g., T0 in the figure. For temperatures
between the two saturation temperatures (T1 to T6), the mixture will split
into two phases at X &prime;1 (T, p) and X
</p>
<p>&prime;&prime;
1 (T, p), if the overall mole fraction X1 lies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>498 22 Phase Equilibrium in Mixtures
</p>
<p>between these values; else the mixture is either liquid (for X1 &le; X &prime;1 (T, p)) or
vapor (for X1 &ge; X &prime;&prime;1 (T, p)).
</p>
<p>22.5 Distillation
</p>
<p>Distillation is a separation procedure based on the different compositions
of vapor and liquid mixture in equilibrium. Figure 22.4 shows a sketch for a
bubble tray column for distillation that matches the T-X-diagram of Fig. 22.3.
A temperature gradient is imposed by heating at the bottom and cooling
at the top of the column. Several bubble trays are inserted in the column.
Industrial columns have up to 100 trays and can reach heights of 60 metres.
Heating at the bottom generates vapor that rises in the column, while liquid
is generated by condensation at the cooled top and drips down.
</p>
<p>On the trays, which all have different temperatures following the temper-
ature gradient established in the column, the rising vapor passes as bubbles
through the liquid. This contact between vapor and liquid establishes thermo-
dynamic equilibrium on the tray, determined by the pressure in the column
and the temperature on the tray. Consider the tray at T3: The vapor leav-
ing the tray upwards has the mole fraction X &prime;&prime;1 (T3) while the liquid dripping
down has the mole fraction X &prime;1 (T3). Figure 22.5 illustrates how liquid and
vapor pass through the tray: The vapor is forced to bubble through the liquid,
and this leads to exchange of components and energy.
</p>
<p>For the mixture shown in Figs. 22.3 and 22.4, component 1 is more volatile,
so that the vapor becomes richer in component 1 as it ascends, while the liquid
becomes richer in component 2 as it descends.
</p>
<p>The design and dimensioning of distillation columns is the task of chemical
engineers and will not be discussed further. Obviously, distillation becomes
more complex when multicomponent mixtures are involved, when saturation
temperatures of components are close, and when the mixtures exhibit non-
ideal behavior, e.g., azeotropes, see Sec. 22.11.

<p>22.6 Saturation Pressure and Temperature of a
Solvent

<p>We consider solutions of low volatility components, e.g., salts, in a more

solvent vapor is

<p>X &prime;&prime;ν = 1&minus;

</p>
<p>Here, psol (T ) denotes the actual saturation pressure of the solvent vapor
over the solution at temperature T . In other words, the ideal mixture of
composition X &prime;ν at temperature T will boil when the pressure is psol (T ).
</p>
<p>According to (22.15) the actual pressure in the solvent vapor, psol, is
smaller than the saturation pressure of the solvent alone, psatν (T ), that is
the dissolved substances reduce the volatility of the solvent. The reason for
this is a competition between solvent vapor and the salt dissolved in the liq-
uid to increase their entropy: The solvent vapor has a larger entropy than the
solvent liquid, but the dissolved salt has a larger entropy when it can access
a larger volume, that is when there is more liquid solvent.

<p>Figure 22.6 shows the saturation curves for the pure solvent and the so-
lution in a p-T-diagram. The curve for the pure solvent (psatν ) lies above the
curve for the solution (psol), in accordance with (22.15). The figure shows
that for a given pressure p the saturation temperature Tsol (p) of the solution
is higher than the saturation temperature T satν (p) of the solvent alone: at a
given pressure saltwater boils at higher temperatures than pure water. To
estimate the change in saturation temperature, we assume that the slope of
the new saturation curve is close to the slope of the saturation curve of the
solvent as described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (17.46), that is

</p>
<p>22.7 Freezing of a Liquid Solution
</p>
<p>Ice crystals cannot easily accept salt molecules into their lattice, and thus
when a salt solution is cooled, first water will freeze out, while the salt will
remain in the liquid as long as possible. Sea-ice, that is ice that freezes out of
oceans in cold climates, contains no salt. As sea-ice forms, the salt content of
the water just below the ice increases. This salty water has increased density,
and will sink towards the bottom of the ocean, thus driving ocean currents.
Completely frozen salt-water solution is a mixture of pure ice and regions of
salt-water crystals, e.g., NaCl-2H2O crystals.
</p>
<p>The dissolved salt ions move in the liquid, they have a larger entropy when
they can move in a larger volume, that is when more liquid water is present.
So in order to gain entropy, the dissolved salt prevents water from freezing,
which is observed as a drop in the temperature at which water will freeze.
To estimate this drop, we consider solid and liquid as incompressible ideal
mixtures, so that we can approximate the chemical potentials of the solvent
in liquid solution (&prime;) and ice (&prime;&prime;) as
</p>

<p>22.8 Non-ideal Mixtures: Activity and Fugacity
</p>
<p>So far, we considered only ideal mixtures. In this section, we study how non-
ideal effects are incorporated into the description.
</p>
<p>The activity coefficient γα (T, p,Xβ) and the activity aα (T, p,Xβ) =
γα (T, p,Xβ)Xα are defined such that the chemical potential reads
</p>
<p>&micro;̄α (T, p,Xβ) = ḡα (T, p) + R̄T ln aα = ḡα (T, p) + R̄T ln [γαXα] . (22.23)
</p>
<p>As always, ḡα (T, p) denotes the Gibbs free energy of component α alone,
under the same pressure and temperature as the mixture. For ideal mixtures
or ideal gases, the activity coefficient reduces to γα = 1, and the activity
becomes aα = Xα.
</p>
<p>For the description of vapors, one uses typically the fugacity coefficient
ϕα (T, p,Xβ) and the fugacity fα (T, p,Xβ) = ϕαXα
</p>
<p>p
psatα (T )
</p>
<p>, which are defined

<p>22.8 Non-ideal Mixtures: Activity and Fugacity 503
</p>
<p>Here, ḡα (T, p
sat
α (T )) denotes the Gibbs free energy of component α alone at
</p>
<p>saturation under the same temperature as the mixture. When the vapor can
be described as an ideal gas, the fugacity coefficient reduces to ϕα = 1.
</p>
<p>Just as the chemical potential, activity and fugacity depend on the detailed
composition, Xβ , of the respective phase. Thus, on the first glance, it might
seem that the introduction of activity and fugacity and their coefficients has
no advantage, since one replaces one unknown function, the chemical poten-
tial, with another, activity or fugacity. The latter, however, are accessible to
measurements, and this is why they are used in chemical engineering.
</p>
<p>To understand how fugacity can be measured, we consider the Gibbs equa-
tion (20.1) and take mixed derivatives with respect to p and nα, to find

&part;2G
</p>
<p>&part;nα&part;p
. (22.25)
</p>
<p>Here, we insert the chemical potential in the form (22.24) and separate the
term containing the fugacity ϕα. The result is an expression for the change
of ϕα with pressure,
</p>

. (22.26)
</p>
<p>In the limit p &rarr; 0 the vapor will behave as an ideal gas, and therefore will
have the fugacity coefficient ϕα (T, p = 0, Xβ) = 1. Integration at constant
temperature between p = 0 and the actual pressure p thus gives the fugacity
coefficient as

<p>lnϕα (T, p,Xβ) =

</p>
<p>The function under the integral can be measured by systematically adding
component α, and determining the resulting volume change; this must be
repeated for many pressures. Thus, the fugacity can be measured in the
vapor phase.
</p>
<p>Measurements of activity and activity coefficients rely on Raoult&rsquo;s law. We
reconsider Raoult&rsquo;s law for the equilibrium between a liquid and a vapor mix-
ture, where we now use activity and fugacity coefficients to describe the liquid

</p>
<p>22.9 A Simple Model for Heat of Mixing and Activity
</p>
<p>Ideal mixtures have zero enthalpy of mixing Hmix, and their activity coeffi-
cients are unity. We shall now develop a simple model for Hmix to describe
non-ideal behavior. We consider binary mixtures only.
</p>
<p>Part of the internal energy of a substance comes from the interaction poten-
tial between neighboring molecules. For a component alone, this contribution
to energy is included in enthalpy h̄α (T, p) or free energy ḡα (T, p), and we
can consider identical neighboring particles as energetically neutral.
</p>
<p>In a mixture between components 1 and 2, there will be neighboring pairs
of the same type (1-1, 2-2) and pairs of different type (1-2). While the for-
mer are energetically neutral, the formation of the latter can either release or
require energy. When the attractive force between different particles (1-2) is
stronger than that between equal particles (1-1, 2-2), 1-2 pairs are energet-
ically preferred over neutral pairs, due to negative interaction energy; then
energy is released when a mixed pair (1-2) is formed. When the attractive
force between different particles (1-2) is weaker than between equal particles
(1-1, 2-2), neutral pairs are energetically preferred over (1-2) pairs, due to
positive interaction potential; then energy is required to form a pair.
</p>
<p>We consider a mixture of N = N1 +N2 particles of types 1, 2. The proba-
bility to find a particle of type α is NαN and thus the probability to find a pair
</p>
<p>(1-2) is proportional to N1N2N2 . The total number of pairs is of the order of the
total number of particles N , and thus the number of (1-2) pairs is propor-
tional to N N1N2N2 =
</p>
<p>N1N2
N . When we introduce mole numbers, the enthalpy of

<p>It should be noted that at environmental temperatures oxygen and nitrogen
are well above their critical point, where no saturation pressure exists. There-
fore, it is somewhat surprising that the above derivation gives a meaningful
result for these temperatures.
</p>
<p>In carbonated drinks, carbon dioxide dissolves in water under pressure
(normally around 2 bar, depending on temperature). When the pressure is
released by opening the bottle or can, the gas bubbles out, to establish the
equilibrium for the partial pressure of CO2 at the surface. From (22.36) we see
that Henry&rsquo;s constant grows with temperature, so that less gas is dissolved
in warmer water. This is the reason for the effervescence of a warm pop can
as compared to a cold one.

could dissolve 50 times more CO2 than N2), unless a &ldquo;widget&rdquo; is used, where
N2 is enclosed in a small capsule that releases the gas when the pressure in
the can drops after it is opened.

in the discussion of psychrometrics.

<p>Next, we study phase diagrams for non-ideal mixtures, based on Raoult&rsquo;s law
(22.29). To obtain interesting behavior, it suffices to consider non-ideality in
the liquid phase, expressed through activity coefficients of the form (22.33),
while the vapor is considered as a mixture of ideal gases where the fugacity
coefficients are unity.

<p>22.25. For non-ideal mixtures, the saturated liquid and vapor lines meet not
only for the pure substances (X1 = 1 or X1 = 0), but also in a point between,
the so-called azeotrope.
</p>
<p>The corresponding T-X-diagrams at constant p, which are of importance
to understand distillation processes, can be constructed as follows: For the
saturated liquid line one prescribes (X &prime;1, p) in (22.39) and solves numerically
for T to find one point (X &prime;1, T ) of the saturated liquid curve T (p,X
</p>
<p>&prime;
1). The
</p>
<p>curve results from repetition for many values X &prime;1. For the saturated vapor
curve one evaluates (22.40) for values on the saturated liquid curve to com-
pute X &prime;&prime;1 (T (p,X
</p>
<p>&prime;
1) , X
</p>
<p>&prime;
1) and then uses the saturated liquid line to find points
</p>
<p>on the saturated liquid lines as {T (p,X &prime;1) , X &prime;&prime;1 (T (p,X &prime;1) , X &prime;1)}. Figure 22.9
shows the resulting T-X-diagrams corresponding to the p-X-diagrams above,
they show azeotropes as well.
</p>
<p>As compared to the ideal mixture, when the formation of mixed pairs (1-
2) is not favored, which is the case for ε̄ &gt; 0, the mixture becomes more
volatile, as can be seen from the larger vapor pressures in Fig. 22.8 and the
lower saturation temperatures in Fig. 22.9. When the formation of mixed
pairs is favored, ε̄ &lt; 0, the mixture is less volatile, vapor pressures are lower,
and saturation temperatures are higher.
</p>
<p>Azeotropic mixtures cannot be separated by distillation processes, as be-
comes obvious when one considers the distillation column discussed earlier in
conjunction with an azeotropic T-X-diagram. The location of the azeotrope
might change with pressure, and separation can be achieved by distillation
at different pressures (for the model used to generate these figures, this effect
is very weak, however). Other methods for separation of azeotropic mixtures
are discussed in the chemical engineering literature.

<p>22.22. Henry&rsquo;s Law: Measurement of Oxygen Content of Lake
Water
In order to retrieve water from deeper layers of a lake, the following simple
device is suggested: A cylinder of volume V = 0.11 litre is filled with helium
at 2 bar. The device is brought to the desired depth, and a valve is opened
which allows water to enter the system, while the helium remains inside. Then
the system is brought to the surface, and a sample of the water is taken to
analyze the oxygen content.
</p>
<p>The temperatures of all gases and liquids are assumed to be 9 ◦C, and the
pressure on top of the lake is 0.9 bar. Density of water is 1 kg/litre. Henry&rsquo;s
constant for O2 in water at 9
</p>
<p>◦C is HO2(T ) = 31200 bar.
</p>
<p>1. 100ml of water enter the system&mdash;estimate the depth at which the valve
was opened.
</p>
<p>2. It is measured that the mole fraction of oxygen in the water sample is
1.1 &times; 10&minus;6. Use this information to compute the mole fraction of oxygen
in the water where the sample was taken.
</p>
<p>Hint: Obviously, some of the oxygen will gas out and enter the gas volume
spanned by the helium, and this leads to a lower gas content in the liquid.
</p>
<p>22.23. Measurement of Henry&rsquo;s Constant
To measure Henry&rsquo;s constant for oxygen in water, the following device is
suggested. A container is divided into two equal parts, one part is filled with
highly purified water, the other part is filled with oxygen at 10 bar. Then,
the division is removed, and oxygen and water assume an equilibrium state.
The gas pressure is measured as 9.66 bar, and throughout the measurement
the temperature is kept at 20 ◦C. Determine Henry&rsquo;s constant HO2 (T ), and
the relative amount of oxygen that enters the liquid.
</p>
<p>Hint: Ignore the change in volume due to oxygen entering the liquid.

<p>23.1 Stoichiometric Coefficients
</p>
<p>In a chemical reaction, the composition of a mixture changes due to the
formation of chemical compounds. The chemical changes are expressed in
reaction equations, e.g., for the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen,
where two hydrogen molecules and one oxygen molecule react to form two
water molecules,
</p>
<p>2H2 + 1O2 ⇋ 2H2O (23.1)
</p>
<p>or
&minus;2H2 &minus; 1O2 + 2H2O = 0 . (23.2)
</p>
<p>The first reaction equation uses arrows to indicate the possibility of forward
and backward reactions, while the second is written as an actual equation.
The coefficients (&minus;2, &minus;1, +2) are the stoichiometric coefficients γα, which
count how many particles of species α are involved in the reaction. Posi-
tive stoichiometric coefficients refer to products, negative coefficients refer to
reactants.
</p>
<p>Chemical reactions can occur forward and backward. In chemical equilib-
rium, the composition of the reacting mixture does not change and there
are as many forward as backward reactions. Thus, the definition of &ldquo;for-
ward&rdquo; and &ldquo;backward&rdquo; is somewhat arbitrary, which implies that the signs
of the stoichiometric coefficients can be switched. Moreover, multiplication
of all stoichiometric coefficients with the same factor is possible as well, e.g.,
an alternative chemical equation for the above reaction is (multiplication
with &minus; 12 )

<p>23.2 Mass and Mole Balances
</p>
<p>Due to chemical reactions, the mole numbers of all components involved in
the reaction change. The reaction rate λ is defined as the number of net reac-
tions (counted in moles) per unit time and volume. The reaction rate can be
positive or negative, depending whether forward or backward reactions pre-
vail. For each mole of reactions there are γα moles of component α produced
or consumed. The rate of change of mole number for component α reads
</p>
<p>dnα

</p>
<p>= γαV λ . (23.4)
</p>
<p>Multiplication with the molar massMα gives the corresponding rate of change
for mass,
</p>
<p>dmα
dt
</p>
<p>= γαMαV λ . (23.5)

<p>The total mass, m =

<p>dm
</p>
<p>dt
= V λ
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>γαMα = 0 , (23.6)
</p>
<p>where the summation has to be taken over all substances involved in the
reaction, that is products and reactants. Thus, the mass of the products is
equal to the mass of the reactants,
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>γαMα = 0 . (23.7)
</p>
<p>Division of (23.4) by the stoichiometric coefficient, and taking the difference
of the result for different components gives a conservation law,

</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can balance the mole numbers of elements, since these
must be conserved (nuclear reactions excluded). The only elements in the
water reaction are oxygen and hydrogen, and the conservation of elements
gives rise to the equations

Obviously, this is equivalent to the previous equations. Balancing of elements
must be used when multiple reactions occur.
</p>
<p>23.3 Heat of Reaction
</p>
<p>Chemical reactions are accompanied by changes in energy. We consider a
mixture in a piston-cylinder system at (T, p), in which reactions take place
at constant pressure and temperature. The heat of reaction is defined as the
amount of heat that must be exchanged to keep temperature and pressure
constant.
</p>
<p>Since the system is isobaric, the first law assumes the form
</p>
<p>H2 &minus;H1 = Q12 . (23.13)
</p>
<p>The initial enthalpy is
</p>
<p>H1 =
&sum;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>n1αh̄α , (23.14)
</p>
<p>and when a total of Λ =
&int; 2
</p>
<p>1
V λdt moles of net reactions take place, the final
</p>
<p>enthalpy is
</p>
<p>H2 =
&sum;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>n1α + γαΛ
)
</p>
<p>h̄α . (23.15)
</p>
<p>Thus, the heat of reaction for one mole of reactions is2
</p>
<p>∆h̄R (T, p) =
Q12
Λ
</p>
<p>=
&sum;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>γαh̄α . (23.16)
</p>
<p>A reaction with ∆h̄R &lt; 0 is an exothermic reaction, heat must be with-
drawn to keep the temperature constant. A reaction with ∆h̄R &gt; 0 is an
endothermic reaction, heat must be added to keep the temperature constant.

α.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>520 23 Reacting Mixtures
</p>
<p>The heat of reaction can be measured. Normally, one finds ∆h̄R tabulated
at standard conditions, i.e. at T0 = 298.15K, p0 = 1bar. Some values are
given in the following table:
</p>

CH4 + 2O2 ⇋ CO2 + 2H2O(v) : ∆h̄R = &minus;802.3 kJmol
</p>
<p>If one of the products is water, the heat of reaction depends on whether the
product water is liquid (l) or vapor (v). Note that a change of sign or value of
the stoichiometric coefficients changes sign and value of the heat of reaction;
e.g., for the reaction 2H2O(l) ⇋ 2H2 + 1O2, we find ∆h̄R = 571.6

</p>
<p>23.4 Heating Value
</p>
<p>The heating value is defined as the energy released in the combustion of 1 kg
of fuel at reference conditions. One distinguishes between the lower heating
value (LHV), where the product water is vapor (v) and the higher heating
value (HHV), where the product water is liquid (l). The difference is just the
heat of evaporation of the the product water at standard reference tempera-
ture T0 which is 2442

<p>23.5 Enthalpy of Formation
</p>
<p>When we discussed the measurement of properties, it became clear that in-
ternal energy, enthalpy and entropy cannot be measured directly. What can
be measured is, for instance, the specific heat at constant pressure, and the
thermal equation of state. The enthalpy follows by integration, as shown in
(16.34), which for the molar enthalpy of α assumes the form</p>

</p>
<p>(23.17)
</p>
<p>When chemical reactions take place, the reference enthalpy h̄0α =
h̄α (T0, p0) cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Indeed, for a reaction occurring at
(T0, p0) the heat of reaction&mdash;which can be measured&mdash;is ∆h̄R (T0, p0) =
&sum;
</p>
<p>γαh̄
0
α. Thus, the reference enthalpies h̄
</p>
<p>0
α for different substances must
</p>
<p>be properly related, so that they give the proper, i.e., measured, heat of
reaction&mdash;for all possible reactions.
</p>
<p>To ensure this, the following convention is used to define the reference en-
thalpies as enthalpies of formation h̄0f at (T0, p0): Stable elements at (T0, p0),
such as O2, N2, H2, C are assigned values of zero enthalpy,
</p>
<p>h̄0f,α = 0 (stable elements) . (23.18)
</p>
<p>The values h̄0f,α for compounds follows from measurement of ∆h̄R. For in-
stance for the water reaction

<p>∆h̄R = h̄

</p>

</p>
<p>2
h̄0f,O2 = h̄
</p>
<p>0
f,H2O . (23.19)
</p>
<p>While it would be convenient to use the h̄0f,α as reference for thermody-
namic property tables, this is most often not done. Most property tables that
list enthalpy and internal energy as functions of temperature and pressure
refer to other reference states. For ideal gas tables it is customary to scale
such that the extrapolated enthalpy at T = 0K is zero. Vapor tables often
have the internal energy or the enthalpy at the triple point set to zero. Thus,
the tabulated values must be re-scaled before they are used for computations
involving chemical reactions.
</p>
<p>We discuss how the proper data can be found, when the molar enthalpy
h̃α (T, p) is tabulated. When no chemical reactions occur, the tabulated data
can be used as is. However, when chemical reactions are considered, the
tabulated values h̃α (T, p) must be corrected to the proper reference. Since
enthalpy differences are independent of the choice of the reference state, and
since the enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy at (T0, p0), we have h̄α (T, p)&minus;
h̄0f,α = h̃α (T, p)&minus; h̃α (T0, p0), or

<p>Here, h̃α (T, p) denotes tabulated enthalpy values, and h̄α (T, p) denotes the
enthalpies with proper reference value that must be used for the discussion
of chemical reactions.</p>

<p>23.6 The Third Law of Thermodynamics
</p>
<p>Also the entropy of a substance can be determined from integration based on
measurements of specific heat and the thermal equation of state. Equation
(16.35) written for the molar entropy of component α reads
</p>
<p>s̄α (T, p)&minus; s̄0f,α =

<p>∆h̄α,i
Ti
</p>
<p>,
</p>
<p>(23.21)
with the entropies of formation s̄0f,α = s̄α (T0, p0).
</p>
<p>The Third Law of Thermodynamics, formulated by Walther Nernst (1864-
1941) based on experimental evidence, states that at absolute zero (T = 0K),
the entropy of any crystalline substance is a constant, and independent of
pressure and other properties (e.g. magnetization). Based on the microscopic
definition of entropy, S = k lnΩ, Max Planck (1858-1947) found that the
value of the constant depends on the quantum mechanical ground state,
and it is zero for crystals that only have one ground state (Ω = 1); then
s (T = 0K) = 0. Systems with more ground states have a residual entropy.
</p>
<p>The third law allows to determine the entropy of formation s̄0f,α =
s̄α (T0, p0) from (23.21) by evaluating it at T = 0K and p = p0, which
yields 3
</p>
<p>s̄0f,α = s̄α (T0, p0) =
</p>
<p>&int; T0
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>c̄p,α (T
&prime;, p0)
</p>
<p>T &prime;
dT &prime; +
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>∆h̄α,i
Ti
</p>
<p>. (23.22)
</p>
<p>For substances with residual entropy, the latter must be added on the right
hand side. Thus, the third law assigns absolute values to the entropy constants
s̄0α = s̄α (T0, p0), i.e., the entropies of formation, which can be found in tables.
</p>
<p>Most data tables for ideal gases show the entropy values s̄α (T, p0) with
respect to the proper reference, so that the tabulated value s̄α (T0, p0) is the
entropy of formation of α at standard reference conditions. In other words,
in contrast to enthalpy data, tabulated entropy data normally needs not to
be corrected. A notebale exception are saturation tables, e.g., for water one
</p>
<p>3 Note that the sign of the enthalpies of phase change, ∆h̄α,i, depends on the
direction of the phase change as the line of integration crosses a saturation curve
in the p-T-plane. When the integration goes from (T0, p0) to (0K, p0), the ∆h̄α,i
are negative. For (23.22) the sign was switched, so that the ∆h̄α,i appear with a
plus sign.</p>

<p>23.7 The Third Law and Absolute Zero 523
</p>
<p>often finds the reference set such that the entropy of liquid at the triple point
is set to zero.
</p>
<p>23.7 The Third Law and Absolute Zero
</p>
<p>An interesting implication of the third law is that a temperature of absolute
zero cannot be reached in a finite number of process steps. This can best be
shown with the help of the T-s-diagram in Fig. 23.1, which shows lines of
constant property ψ (e.g., pressure, magnetization, . . . ).
</p>
<p>Fig. 23.1 Series of isothermal-isentropic processes between lines of constant ψ to
reach low temperatures; ψ can be any property (except T, s)
</p>
<p>Due to the third law, the lines of constant ψ all emerge from one point at
T = 0K. To reach low temperatures, one can take a relatively large amount of
substance at (T1, ψ1) and subject it to an adiabatic process ending at (T2, ψ2).
Next, one takes a part of the substance at (T2, ψ2) and brings it to (T2, ψ1)
isothermally, where the rest of substance at (T2, ψ2) serves as a temperature
reservoir. Now one repeats the series of adiabatic and isothermal processes,
with smaller and smaller amounts of substance. The resulting zigzag process is
shown in the figure, where for simplicity the adiabatic processes are drawn as
adiabatic reversible&mdash;i.e., isentropic&mdash;processes. Since the curves of constant
ψ meet in the origin, the distance between the curves becomes smaller and
smaller, and each step leads to a temperature reduction smaller than the
previous. Accordingly, the heat δq = Tds removed per unit mass in each
isothermal step becomes smaller and smaller as well. Evidently, absolute zero
cannot be reached with a finite number of steps.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>524 23 Reacting Mixtures
</p>
<p>Another conclusion from the third law refers to the specific heat: When
phase changes are excluded, specific heat and entropy are related by
</p>
<p>s̄ (T, p) =
</p>
<p>&int; T
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>c̄p (T
&prime;, p)
</p>
<p>T &prime;
dT &prime; . (23.23)
</p>
<p>Entropy must remain finite in the limit T &rarr; 0K, which implies that the
specific heat must vanish in the limit,

T&rarr;0K

<p>c̄p (T

<p>23.10 Example: NH3 Production (Haber-Bosch
Process)
</p>
<p>Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important materials in chemical industry.
It is used for the production of fertilizers and explosives, as cooling fluid in re-
frigeration systems, and as source material for many other chemical processes.
The world ammonia production is about 130&times; 106 ty , and an ammonia plant
that produces 1500 td consumes about 650MW of energy; the energy required
to produce one ton is ca. 35GJ. Approximately 1% of the world&rsquo;s energy
usage is devoted to the production of ammonia!
</p>
<p>Before Haber and Bosch found out how to produce ammonia industrially,
the supply came from guano fields off the cost of South America (guano is
. . . bird droppings). Here, we discuss the basic principles of the Haber-Bosch
process which was developed by Fritz Haber (1868-1934) and brought to
industrial production by Carl Bosch (1874-1940).
</p>
<p>Ammonia is produced by combining hydrogen, normally obtained from
natural gas by steam methane reforming, with nitrogen from air, where the
oxygen is removed by reaction with carbon monoxide and hydrogen from
the hydrogen production step. The chemical equation for ammonia synthesis
reads
</p>
<p>&minus;N2 &minus; 3H2 + 2NH3 = 0 ,
and the law of mass action (23.31) for this reaction assumes the form
</p>
<p>p2NH3
pN2p
</p>
<p>3
H2
</p>
<p>= Kp (T ) .
</p>
<p>In order to determine the equilibrium compositions of ammonia, nitrogen and
hydrogen at given (T, p), we require the balances of hydrogen and nitrogen
mole numbers, and the total pressure,
</p>
<p>nNH3 + 2nN2 = 2n
0
N2 , 3nNH3 + 2nH2 = 2n
</p>
<p>0
H2 , p = pNH3 + pN2 + pH2 .

<p>Pressures and mole numbers are related via the ideal gas law
</p>
<p>nα =

</p>

,
</p>
<p>where V is the reactor volume. Thus, we have four equations for the four

<p>bar2
,
</p>
<p>Kp (773K) = 1.585&times; 10&minus;5
1
</p>
<p>bar2
.
</p>
<p>Thus, a larger ammonia fraction is encountered for smaller temperatures,
where Kp (T ) is larger, and for larger pressures. For instance, at T = 300K
and p = 1bar, one finds XNH3 = 0.935 and this increases to XNH3 = 0.9970
when the pressure is increased to 500 bar.
</p>
<p>However, when one mixes hydrogen and nitrogen at (300K, 1 bar), the
mixture does not approach thermodynamic equilibrium, but remains in a
metastable state; nothing happens, since the reaction rate is too slow. As
Haber found out, iron catalysts are required to advance the reaction, but
these work only at relatively high temperatures, where the ammonia yield
is relatively small. In order to have a significant yield, the process must be
performed under high pressures. For a reactor temperature of T = 773K, the
mole fraction is XNH3 = 0.309 for p = 500 bar, but only XNH3 = 0.0013 for
p = 1bar.
</p>
<p>In continuous reactors, the product is cooled (at pressures below psat), the
ammonia condenses and is removed, while the unused portions of hydrogen
and nitrogen are fed back into the production process.</p>

<p>23.11 Le Chatelier Principle
</p>
<p>The ammonia reaction shifts its equilibrium towards the desired product
when the temperature is lower, and the pressure is higher. To study how
changes of temperature and pressure affect the chemical equilibrium in other
reactions (for ideal mixtures), we turn to (23.30) and compute the change of
the equilibrium constantKX (T, p) with pressure and temperature. According
to the definition, larger KX implies more product.
</p>
<p>We compute first the change of KX with temperature, as
</p>

&sum;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>γαs̄α = &minus;∆s̄R . (23.36)
</p>
<p>It follows that an endothermic reaction (∆h̄R &gt; 0) will advance further at
larger temperatures, while an exothermic reaction (∆h̄R &lt; 0) will advance
further at lower temperatures. The ammonia reaction is exothermic, and thus
temperature increase reduces the yield. Dissociation processes, e.g., H2 ⇋
2H, are endothermic and thus pronounced dissociation takes place at high
temperatures.
</p>
<p>For the change of KX with pressure we find

<p>α

</p>
<p>we might call ∆v̄R the volume of reaction. Note that v̄α (T, p) is the volume
of component α alone at temperature and pressure of the mixture. We have
∆v̄R &lt; 0 when the volume of the product is less than the volume of the
reactants, and ∆v̄R &gt; 0 when the volume of the product is larger than the
volume of the reactants. The reaction will advance further at higher pressures
for negative volumes of reaction, ∆v̄R &lt; 0.
</p>
<p>For ideal gases, we have v̄ (T, p) = R̄T/p, hence, when all components are
ideal gases, the volume of reaction becomes</p>

<p>In the ammonia reaction one mole of N2 and three moles of H2 combine to two
moles of NH3, hence
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>α γα = &minus;2. Thus, the product has half the volume
of the reactants, the volume of reaction is negative, and pressure increase
advances the reaction. In dissociation processes, e.g., H2 &rarr; 2H, the product
has a larger volume, and pressure increase reduces the amount of dissociated
gas.
</p>
<p>The above statements are examples, for ideal mixtures, of Le Chatelier&rsquo;s
Principle (Henry Le Châtelier, 1850-1936) which states that A change in one
of the variables (temperature, pressure, concentration, . . . ) that describe a
system in equilibrium, produces a shift in the position of the equilibrium that
counteracts the change.
</p>
<p>For instance, when a reactive mixture with exothermic reaction is heated
to a higher temperature, backward reactions occur which consume energy
and reduce the temperature. When the pressure is increased on a reactive
mixture of ideal gases with negative reaction volume ∆v̄R, reactions occur
that reduce the overall particle number, and increase the mole volume v̄, to
reduce the pressure p = RTv̄ .
</p>
<p>23.12 Multiple Reactions

<p>In many technical applications multiple reactions occur simultaneously. We
denote the reaction rate densities for the various reactions as λa and the
stoichiometric coefficient for component α in reaction a as γaα, where the
superscript a = 1, . . . , N indicates the reaction. The mole balance for com-
ponent α then reads

<p>Activation of Reactions
</p>
<p>24.1 Approaching Chemical Equilibrium
</p>
<p>So far, we have considered chemical equilibrium, which stands at the end of
a reactive process, but not the details of reaching the equilibrium. In the dis-
cussion of the ammonia synthesis, we have mentioned the need for catalysts,
which facilitate the reactions, and are required to reach the equilibrium state
in reasonable time. In the present chapter, we shall discuss reaction rates,
and the activation of reactions. Activation losses are an important cause of
losses in fuel cells, and thus we will come back to this topic in the discussion
of thermodynamics of fuel cells.

<p>Fig. 24.1 Metastable state in mechanics
</p>
<p>To introduce the problem, we consider a mechanical analogy, see Fig. 24.1.
The stable state for the ball is the minimum at the bottom, but it is trapped
in a metastable state at a local minimum at height H . In order to reach
the absolute minimum, the ball has to overcome the well of height h, which
requires energy.
</p>
<p>For chemical reactions to occur, the reactant molecules must be split into
parts that then can take part in forming the products. This requires energy,

<p>536 24 Activation of Reactions
</p>
<p>which can come, e.g., from collisional impact. As an example we consider the
formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen. The reactants are gases, and
even at high pressures, most collisions involve only two particles, while three-
particle collisions are very rare. In the following list X denotes a collision
partner that provides or removes energy to or from the collisions, but is not
involved in the reaction itself. The reactions that happen in the formation of
water are
</p>
<p>H2 +X ⇋ 2H + X
O2 +X ⇋ 2O + X
H+O2 ⇋ O+OH
O+H2 ⇋ H+OH
OH+H2 ⇋ H2O+H
</p>
<p>OH+H+X ⇋ H2O+X
</p>
<p>From the statement that two-particle collisions are far more frequent than
three-particle collisions one might conclude that the first two reactions will
mainly happen in the forward direction (high energy impact of X on H2 or
O2 splits these), while the last reaction will mainly happen in the backward
direction (splitting of water by impact of X). The rate at which reactions
take place will be proportional to the probability for a collision and to the
probability that a reaction actually occurs when a collision takes place.
</p>
<p>24.2 Reaction Rates and the Chemical Constant
</p>
<p>We consider a simple reaction of the type
</p>
<p>A + B ⇋ C +D . (24.1)
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the rates of change of the mole densities να = nα/V of the
involved species must be related as
</p>
<p>dνA
dt
</p>
<p>=
dνB
dt
</p>
<p>= &minus;dνC
dt
</p>
<p>= &minus;dνD
dt
</p>
<p>. (24.2)
</p>
<p>We consider the rate of change of molecules of species A. Molecules of
type A are produced in backward reactions at rate rb and are consumed in
forward reactions at rate rf . The rate of change is just the difference between
backward and forward reactions,
</p>
<p>dνA
dt
</p>
<p>= rb &minus; rf . (24.3)
</p>
<p>Each rate, rb or rf , is proportional to the probability to find the reaction
partners at the same location, and to the probability that a reaction will
actually take place when the partners meet. An intuitive choice for the rates
is
</p>
<p>rb = kbνCνD , rf = kfνAνB , (24.4)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24.3 Gibbs Free Energy of Activation 537
</p>
<p>where νCνD and νAνB are measures for the probability to find the reac-
tion partners C &minus; D or A &minus; B, and kb, kf measure the reaction probability
(and include scaling factors for the probability). The above are the simplest
meaningful choices for the reaction rates; realistic reactions will have more
complicated relations between reaction rates and mole densities.
</p>
<p>According to the model, the rate of change of the mole density of species
A is
</p>
<p>dνA
dt
</p>
<p>= kbνCνD &minus; kfνAνB . (24.5)
</p>
<p>This equation describes the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium. In the
final equilibrium state dνAdt = 0 and the rate equation gives the law of mass
action of this reaction as

</p>

<p>is the chemical constant. Indeed, since for this reaction the total number
of moles stays constant, and since all stoichiometric coefficients are &plusmn;1, we
can write

&minus;∆ḡR
</p>
<p>R̄T ; (24.7)
</p>
<p>the last identity follows from the law of mass action for ideal mixtures (23.30).
</p>
<p>24.3 Gibbs Free Energy of Activation
</p>
<p>The law of mass action (24.7) does not allow to identify the reaction rate
coefficients kb and kf individually, it only relates their ratio to the Gibbs free
energy of reaction. We split the latter into two contributions, the Gibbs free
energies of activation for backward and forward reactions, ḡb and ḡf , as
</p>
<p>&minus;∆ḡR = ḡb &minus; ḡf . (24.8)
</p>
<p>The law of mass action (24.7) is fulfilled for the coefficients
</p>
<p>kf = k0e
&minus; ḡf
</p>
<p>R̄T , kb = k0e
&minus; ḡb
</p>
<p>R̄T , (24.9)
</p>
<p>where k0 is a dimensional factor.
Both coefficients are of the form exp
</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>&minus; ē
R̄T
</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>, where ē is an energy (here,
the Gibbs free energy of activation). The barometric formula is of the same
form, only that there ē is the potential energy Mgz. The factor exp
</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>&minus; ē
R̄T
</p>
<p>]
</p>
<p>is know as the Boltzmann factor, it is the typical form of a probability in a
thermally activated system.
</p>
<p>Figure 24.2 shows the Gibbs free energies of activation in an energy land-
scape that refers back to Fig. 24.1. The Gibbs free energy of reaction, &minus;∆ḡR,
is a measure for the energy difference between the reactants (A,B) and the</p>

<p>products (C,D). The equilibrium of the reaction lies towards the products.
For the forward reaction (A,B) &rarr; (C,D) to occur the activation energy ḡf
must be overcome, for the backward reaction (C,D) &rarr; (A,B) the larger
activation energy ḡb must be overcome.
</p>
<p>In equilibrium, the same number of reactions takes place in both directions,
rf = rb, or kfνAνB = kbνCνD, so that the mole densities of all constituents
do not change in time. Due to the larger activation energy ḡb, the likelihood
</p>
<p>for a backward reaction is less (kb = k0e
&minus; ḡb
</p>
<p>R̄T ) than the likelihood for the
</p>
<p>forward reaction (kf = k0e
&minus; ḡf
</p>
<p>R̄T ). With kb &lt; kf and kfνAνB = kbνCνD
follows νAνB &lt; νCνD: there must be more particles on the product side.
</p>
<p>The activation energies ḡf , ḡb do not affect the equilibrium, which is de-
scribed by the Gibbs free energy of reaction ∆ḡR in the law of mass action.
However, the activation energies determine how fast the equilibrium will be
reached. When the activation energies are large, reactions are unlikely and
the reactants will persist in a metastable state, and make no progress towards
the final equilibrium state.
</p>
<p>The smaller the activation energies divided by temperature,
ḡf,b
R̄T
</p>
<p>, are, the
faster the equilibrium will be reached. Thus, equilibrium will be reached faster
at higher temperatures. Fuel in contact with oxygen must be ignited&mdash;that is
heated to higher T&mdash;to overcome the energy barrier at the point of ignition.
The released heat then provides the energy to overcome the barrier in the
neighborhood, a fast chain reaction occurs.
</p>
<p>Catalysts do not take part in the reaction, but their presence lowers the
activation energies. Ammonia synthesis provides an example for a reaction
that is stuck in a metastable state, and will come to reaction only with the
help of catalysts. Even then, to overcome the energy barrier, the temperature
must be increased.</p>

<p>Combustion
</p>
<p>25.1 Fuels
</p>
<p>Combustion describes the exothermic reaction between a fuel and an oxidizer,
most often oxygen from air. Normally, the reactive equilibrium lies almost
completely on the product side (&sim;99.99%,), so that for computations it can
be assumed that all fuel is consumed, as long as enough oxygen is present.
However, by the Le Chatelier principle, the reaction will be less complete
when the product temperature is high: in very hot combustion one might
have to account for the law of mass action.
</p>
<p>Many fuels are hydrocarbons, CxHy, of different compositions. Of these,
the best known are methane (natural gas) CH4, propane C3H8, n-octane
C8H18, n-dodecane C12H26, and hydrogen H2. Octane is the main ingredi-
ent in gasoline which is a mixture of various hydrocarbons. Similarly, Diesel
fuel is a mixture of heavier hydrocarbons such as dodecane. Other fuels con-
tain additional elements as well, e.g. methyl alcohol CH3OH, ethyl alcohol
C2H5OH, or coal which is mainly carbon (C) and other elements (S, O, H,
N, ash) in varying amounts.

<p>542 25 Combustion
</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide is an odorless and highly toxic gas that is a fuel itself
(CO + 12O2 ⇋ CO2). Combustion processes take place in many reaction
steps, which involve the splitting of larger molecules into smaller units, and
the formation of new species. The formation of H2O and CO is relatively
fast, while the formation of CO2 is slow, hence CO is formed first, and then
reacts to CO2 later.
</p>
<p>25.2 Combustion Air
</p>
<p>Most combustion processes use air as an oxidizer, which is freely available
for most applications, e.g., stationary power plants or air breathing engines
for cars and airplanes. Rockets fly at high altitudes or in space where the
oxygen density is low or zero and thus they must bring their oxidizer along.
To reduce payload, rocket engines are fed with fuel and pure oxygen, or with
solid oxidizer-fuel compounds, e.g., ammonium perchlorate and aluminium
powder.
</p>
<p>For combustion with air, the oxygen is accompanied by the other com-
ponents of air. Since oxygen and nitrogen are the two main ingredients, in
combustion analysis one normally ignores the other components, and consid-
ers air as a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen with XO2 = 0.21 and XN2 = 0.79.
Thus, in dry air for one mole of oxygen 1XO2
</p>
<p>= 4.76 moles of air are required,
</p>
<p>that is each mole of oxygen is accompanied by 3.76 moles of nitrogen.
Due to the presence of nitrogen, nitrogen oxides (NOx) may form in the
</p>
<p>combustion processes which are toxic. Since the amounts are small, the for-
mation of NOx will be ignored below, but due to the toxicity the formation
of NOx must be monitored, and suppressed, in practice.
</p>
<p>The amount of oxygen that is required for complete combustion of a fuel
is known as the stoichiometric amount, the corresponding amount of air is
denoted as stoichiometric air or as theoretical air. For the general hydrocar-
bon reaction (25.1) the stoichiometric air is
</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>4.76
(
</p>
<p>x+ y4
)]
</p>
<p>moles of air per
mole of fuel. Often the air amount is given as percent of theoretical air, for
instance 150% of theoretical air corresponds to
</p>
<p>[
</p>
<p>7.14
(
</p>
<p>x+ y4
)]
</p>
<p>moles of air
per mole of fuel, or to 50% of excess air .
</p>
<p>25.3 Example: Mole and Mass Flow Balances
</p>
<p>As an example we consider the combustion of a mass flow ṁF = 5
kg
h of
</p>
<p>octane (C8H18) with 150% theoretical air. We ask for the mass flow of air
required, and the mass flows of the products. Since chemical balances concern
mole numbers rather than masses, we first determine the mole flow of fuel as

<p>25.3 Example: Mole and Mass Flow Balances 543
</p>
<p>The required amount of air, and the resulting amount of product, is deter-
mined by writing a chemical equation for all involved components as
</p>
<p>C8H18 + 1.5a (O2 + 3.76N2) &rarr; 0.5aO2 + bCO2 + cH2O+ dN2 .
</p>
<p>Here, a is the amount of oxygen required for the stoichiometric combustion
per mole of fuel, the factor 1.5 on the left accounts for 150% of theoretical
air. The first term on the right is the unused portion of oxygen, which is total
oxygen coming in (1.5a) minus the stoichiometric amount (a). The numbers
a, b, c, d must be determined from balancing the elements C, H, O and N, on
both sides of the equation. This gives

<p>25.4 Example: Exhaust Water
</p>
<p>For the analysis of combustion processes it is important to know whether
some of the product water is liquid. Liquid water can lead to corrosion in
the system, and should be avoided; it will form when the temperature of the
combustion product sinks below the dewpoint of the product. For the analy-
sis, the moisture content of the incoming combustion air must be considered
as well to obtain accurate results.
</p>
<p>We study this by means of an example. Fuel gas with a volumetric analysis
of 60% CH4 and 40% H2 is burnt with moist air at temperature 20
</p>
<p>◦C and
relative humidity φ = 0.7 with 60% excess air; the pressure is 1 bar. We ask
for the dew point temperature of the combustion product.
</p>
<p>The mole fraction of water in the incoming air is
</p>
<p>XH2O =
pv
p
</p>
<p>= φ
psat (20
</p>
<p>◦C)
</p>
<p>p
= 0.0164 ,
</p>
<p>so that each mole of oxygen is accompanied by XH2O/XO2 = 0.079 moles of
water.1 Then, the overall mole balance for the combustion per mole of fuel
reads
</p>
<p>0.6CH4 + 0.4H2 + 1.6a (O2 + 3.76N2 + 0.079H2O)
</p>
<p>&rarr; 0.6aO2 + bCO2 + cH2O+ dN2 ,
</p>
<p>which yields, from balancing elements (C, H, O, N),
</p>
<p>0.6 = b , 0.6&times; 4 + 0.4&times; 2 + 1.6a&times; 0.079&times; 2 = 2c ,
1.6a (2 + 0.079) = 0.6a&times; 2 + 2b+ c , 12.032a = 2d ,
</p>
<p>with the solution
</p>
<p>a = 1.4 , b = 0.6 , c = 1.78 , d = 8.42 .
</p>
<p>1 The calculation is as follows: Mole fraction of water is XH2O =
nH2O
</p>
<p>nO2+nN2+nH2O
;
</p>
<p>with nN2 = 3.76nO2 follows

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.5 First and Second Law for Combustion Systems 545
</p>
<p>The mole fraction of water in the product is
</p>
<p>XprodH2O =
c
</p>
<p>0.6a+ b+ c+ d
= 0.153 .
</p>
<p>Thus, the partial pressure of the vapor in the product is pv = 0.153 bar which
corresponds to a dewpoint temperature Td = Tsat (pv) = 54.4
</p>
<p>◦C.
When the reaction product is cooled below the dewpoint, cliq moles of
</p>
<p>water per mole of fuel will condense, while the remaining cvap = c&minus;cliq moles
per mole of fuel will be in the vapor phase. When the product temperature is
25 ◦C, the partial pressure of the vapor in the gas phase is pv = psat (25 ◦C) =
3.169 kPa, and the mole fraction of the vapor is

<p>XH2O =

</p>
<p>Thus, for each mole of fuel there will be 1.452mol of liquid water in the
system, which have to be removed.

<p>25.5 First and Second Law for Combustion Systems
</p>
<p>The goal of combustion is to produce heat, either for heating purposes or for
conversion into work in heat engines. Since the changes in chemical energy
are reflected in the proper values for enthalpies (23.20) and entropies (23.22),
the first and second law for a combustion system have the usual form (9.9,
9.10),

<p>The temperature Tf of the combustion product is the adiabatic flame tem-
perature.
</p>
<p>25.7 Example: Adiabatic Flame Temperature
</p>
<p>As an example, we compute the adiabatic flame temperature for the combus-
tion process studied in Section 25.3, when the incoming fuel and airstreams
are at reference temperature and pressure, Tin = T0, p = p0. Then, the
enthalpies for the incoming streams are

</p>
<p>h̄O2 (Tin) = h̄
0
f,O2 = 0 , h̄N2 (Tin) = h̄
</p>
<p>0
f,N2 = 0 .
</p>
<p>After division by ṅF , and with the results of Sec. 25.3, the energy balance
(25.7) becomes
</p>
<p>bh̄CO2 (Tf ) + 0.5ah̄O2 (Tf) + ch̄H2O (Tf) + dh̄N2 (Tf) = h̄F (Tin, p) .
</p>
<p>When written with tabulated enthalpy values h̃α (T ) instead, this gives, by
means of (23.20),

is p1 = 10 atm. Reactants and products are considered as ideal gases.
</p>
<p>The chemical equation for this reaction is
</p>
<p>CH4 + 9O2 = CO2 + 2H2O+ 7O2 ,
</p>
<p>which implies nCO2 = 1mol, nH2O = 2mol, nO2 = 7mol. The final tempera-

sitions change. and are affected by the different entropies of formation s̄0f,α of
the various constituents. One will expect entropy generation in combustion,
since combustion processes cannot be controlled once started. As always, the
generation of entropy is related to a work loss.
</p>
<p>The computation of the entropy changes in steady state combustion in
open systems will be seen in Sec. 25.12. Here we have a look at the entropy</p>

<p>25.11 Work Potential of a Fuel
</p>
<p>As we have seen in the last section, combustion processes are accompanied
by entropy generation. Combustion is irreversible, and work potential is lost
to the irreversibility. In order to quantify the work loss, we ask how much
work one could obtain from a fuel in a reversible process.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.1 shows the mass and energy flows of a fuel consuming power
plant: fuel and oxidizer enter the plant at reference conditions (T0, p0) and
are processed inside the plant, which produces the net power Ẇnet and rejects

</p>
<p>and we assume that they are in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with
the outer environment, i.e., they are at (T0, p0) as well. This guarantees that
most work available from the exhaust with respect to the environment is
harvested. Note that, in principle, some work could be obtained by reversible</p>

heat engines, that is Otto, Diesel, Brayton, Rankine cycles, and their variants,
and to electrochemical power devices, i.e., fuel cells.
</p>
<p>Elimination of the heat rejected into the environment between (25.5) and
(25.6) gives the net work of the plant as

</p>
<p>All irreversible processes occurring inside the plant, e.g., combustion, heat
transfer over finite temperature differences, or friction losses in turbines, con-
tribute to the entropy generation Ṡgen, and thus diminishes the net work
output of the plant.
</p>
<p>We evaluate (25.15) for the stoichiometric combustion of a fuel with pure
oxygen, with the chemical equation
</p>
<p>|γfuel| fuel +

</p>
<p>∣γO2
∣
</p>
<p>∣O2 = γCO2CO2 + γH2OH2O . (25.16)
</p>
<p>We choose γfuel = &minus;1, and thus the mole flow of oxygen entering is ṅO2 =

</p>
<p>∣ ṅfuel and the mole flows of the products, carbon dioxide and water, are
ṅCO2 = γCO2 ṅfuel and ṅH2O = γH2Oṅfuel.
</p>
<p>Since all flows are entering and leaving at atmospheric conditions (T0, p0),
we have h̄α (T0, p0) &minus; T0s̄α (T0, p0, Xα) = ḡα (T0, p0) + R̄T0 lnXα, where we
have assumed ideal mixtures; as always ḡα (T0, p0) is the Gibbs free energy
of α alone at standard conditions.</p>

</p>
<p>For this case, (25.15) can be written as

</p>
<p>The last term is the entropy of mixing of the products. Since fuel and oxidizer
enter the system separately, there is no mixing term for the reactants.
</p>
<p>The first term&mdash;which is always negative&mdash;is the work lost to the irre-
versible processes inside the system, and the last term is the work that could
be obtained by reversible mixing of the combustion products CO2 and H2O.
The second term&mdash;which is positive, since for a fuel ∆ḡR &lt; 0&mdash;is just the
Gibbs free energy of reaction, which is the dominant contribution to the
work potential of a fuel. The maximum work obtainable from the fuel in a
reversible process results from setting Ṡgen = 0.
</p>
<p>In case that the combustion products (CO2, H2O) leave the plant in sepa-
rate streams at (T0, p0) the mixing term vanishes (last term in (25.17)), and
the maximum work that can be extracted per mole of fuel in a reversible
process is just the Gibbs free energy of the reaction,
</p>
<p>wrevfuel =
Ẇnet
ṅfuel
</p>
<p>= &minus;∆ḡR (T0, p0) . (25.18)
</p>
<p>Additional work could be obtained by mixing the exhaust streams reversibly
(last term in (25.17)), and by reversible mixing of the exhaust with the envi-
ronmental air. The exhaust is in thermal (T0) and mechanical (p0) equilibrium
with the environment, but not in chemical equilibrium (&micro;̄α,0). For combus-
tion with (excess) air, additional mixing terms arise due to the presence of
N2 and excess O2; these will be studied in the next section.
</p>
<p>The question arises whether the maximum work obtainable from a fuel
can be obtained from actual engineering devices. The answer is no, obvi-
ously, since all realistic processes are somewhat irreversible. It is, however,
important to understand and quantify the different causes for irreversible
losses, since only this understanding can lead to the design of better devices,
with smaller losses.
</p>
<p>In a classical combustion power plant losses are due to combustion, heat
transfer, irreversible mixing, and friction. We shall study the relative impor-
tance of these in an extended example in the next section.
</p>
<p>In fuel cells the flow of electrons is controlled, and thus combustion losses
do not occur, but there are other causes for irreversible losses. Fuel cells and
the losses within will be discussed in Chapter 26.</p>

</p>
<p>The work produced in a combustion power plant differs significantly from the
work available from the fuel, due to entropy generation within the system. In
the present section we study and compare the contributions to work loss from
all elements of a combustion driven Rankine cycle, where we consider different
amounts of excess air. Figure 25.2 shows a simplified picture of the energy
and mass flows in the considered system; neither reheat nor regeneration are
considered. Fuel and air enter the plant at (T0, p0), the fuel is burned at
constant pressure in the combustion chamber so that the flame temperature
is T2, and then the hot flue gas passes the steam generator that delivers heat
to the Rankine cycle. The exhaust leaves the plant at (T3, p0).

maximum work per mole of fuel are found:

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>More work could be obtained for larger amounts of excess air. Part of the
reversible work is related to reversible mixing of the products, and this con-
tribution is larger for larger amounts of excess air.
</p>
<p>Now we proceed with the evaluation of the actual process, which is irre-
versible.
</p>
<p>The combustion chamber is adiabatic, and exchanges no work with the
surroundings. The entropy generation in the combustion process follows from
applying the second law between inlet and combustion chamber exit as
</p>
<p>Ṡcombgen =
&sum;
</p>
<p>out,2
</p>
<p>ṅαs̄α &minus;
&sum;
</p>

</p>
<p>ṅαs̄α .
</p>
<p>The corresponding power loss is T0Ṡ

</p>
<p>the loss and the maximum work as
</p>
<p>T0Ṡ
comb
gen
</p>
<p>Ẇmax
= {51.9%, 38.3%, 30.5%} .
</p>
<p>Thus, depending on the flame temperature (or the amount of excess air),
a large amount of the work that is available from the fuel is lost to the
irreversibility of the combustion process. The loss is larger for lower flame
temperature, since the hotter flow has increased work potential (or exergy):
heat at higher temperature is more valuable. A closer look shows that only
a small part of this loss (2.67%, 1.91%, 1.23%) can be attributed to mixing
loss.
</p>
<p>After the combustion chamber, the hot flue gas enters the heat exchanger
where the heat Q̇SE is withdrawn from the gas and transferred to the steam</p>

<p>ṅαh̄α &minus;
&sum;
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>ṅαh̄α .
</p>
<p>To determine the values, we need to specify the exhaust temperature, and we
assume an exhaust temperature of 400K (127 ◦C). Depending on the flame
temperature, we find the following amounts of heat transmitted to the steam
cycle (per mole of fuel):

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>Since some thermal energy leaves with the exhaust, the heat transmitted lies
below the available heat of reaction, ∆h̄R. Since the total mass flow is higher
at high excess air (low flame temperature), more heat (13.6%∆h̄R) is lost
than in the case for lower amounts of excess air (6.9%, 4.5%).

<p>For the further calculation we have to specify the details of the steam
engine. We choose a standard Rankine cycle operating at condenser temper-

</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>The above analysis gives insight into the relative importance of the differ-
ent entropy generating processes.
</p>
<p>For this standard steam cycle it becomes evident that more than 60% of the
available work are lost in combustion and heat transfer (T0Ṡ
</p>
<p>comb
gen + T0Ṡ
</p>
<p>HE
gen).
</p>
<p>The heat transfer loss is reduced when the flame temperature is smaller, and
more excess air is used, but this also increases the combustion loss.
</p>
<p>For the low exhaust temperature chosen, the exhaust loss (T0Ṡ
exhaust
gen )
</p>
<p>is relatively small, but still amounts to up to 6% of the work produced
(ẆSE). Obviously this contribution will increase when the exhaust is hot-
ter. While we did not explicitly account for regeneration of the exhaust,
which might be used for preheating of the combustion air, see Sec. 12.1,
it is clear that a regenerator will reduce the final exhaust temperature,
T3. When the exhaust temperature is lowered to 350K, the exhaust loss
is {0.51%, 0.27%, 0.18%} of Ẇmax, and the overall efficiency is increased, so
that ẆSE/Ẇmax = {31.6%, 33.0%, 33.7%}.
</p>
<p>Due to the large amount of heat transferred, the condenser loss (T0Ṡ
cond
gen )
</p>
<p>is relatively large. While the temperature difference between environment
and condenser (Tc &minus; T0 = 15 ◦C) cannot be reduced further, this contribu-
tion to the irreversible losses will become smaller when a more efficient heat
cycle (reheat and regeneration) is used, where more of the incoming heat is
converted to work, and less heat is rejected in the condenser.
</p>
<p>The entropy generation in turbine and pump is
</p>
<p>Ṡirrgen = ṁsteam (s2 &minus; s1 + s4 &minus; s3) ,
</p>
<p>which relates to the relative work loss
</p>
<p>T0Ṡ
irr
gen
</p>
<p>Ẇmax
= {5.36%, 5.40%, 5.44%} .
</p>
<p>This loss is already included in the above calculation. Improved turbine and
pump increase the thermal efficiency and thus increase the net work, and
reduce the heat rejection&mdash;and thus the entropy generation&mdash;in the con-
denser. Indeed, for reversible operation of the steam cycle (use of h2s, h4s
instead of h2, h4, η = ηrev = 41%), the relative condenser loss reduces
to {2.40%, 2.61%, 2.70%} ,while the relative amount of power produced,
ẆSE/Ẇmax, increases to {34.5%, 37.5%, 38.7%}.
</p>
<p>In summary, most of the heat available from the fuel, ∆h̄R, is supplied to
the steam cycle, and converted to work with the thermal efficiency of that cy-
cle. Improving the thermal efficiency of the cycle leads to better conversion of
the thermal energy of the hot combustion gas. Modern combined cycle power</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>558 25 Combustion
</p>
<p>plants, in which high temperatures are reached, have a thermal efficiency of
close to 60%.
</p>
<p>It must be noted, though, that the combustion process and the subsequent
heat transfer process are accompanied by a substantial work loss, due to
irreversible combustion and heat transfer. The combustion irreversibility is
due to the uncontrolled reorganization of the molecules in the reaction, which
involves movement of electrons. In fuel cells the paths of the electrons are
controlled, and combustion entropy is avoided. Thus they promise to harvest
larger portions of the theoretically available work. However, also in fuel cells
irreversible processes occur, which reduce their efficiencies, see Chapter 26.

When hydrocarbon fuels are burnt with less than theoretical air, the products
may contain carbon monoxide, carbon (as soot) and hydrogen. When there is
only little deficiency of oxygen, all hydrogen in the fuel will form water, but
some carbon monoxide will exist. This is due to reaction kinetics: water and
carbon monoxide are formed earlier in the combustion process, while carbon
dioxide is formed later from the reaction between CO and O2.

<p>Thermodynamics of Fuel Cells
</p>
<p>26.1 Fuel Cells
</p>
<p>We have seen before that entropy generation in combustion, and subsequent
heat transfer, leads to considerable irreversible work losses. The combustion
loss can be attributed to the uncontrolled movement of electrons as new
molecules are formed in the reaction. Fuel cells offer a process in which the
electron movement is controlled, and thus no combustion losses occur. The
performance of real life fuel cells is diminished by irreversible losses due to
resistance, reaction activation and mass flow restrictions, and these will be
discussed after the basic discussion of fuel cells and their efficiencies.
</p>
<p>In fuel cells an electrochemical process allows to directly convert the energy
stored in a fuel into electrical energy. There are many types of fuel cells that
consume different fuels, e.g. direct methanol fuel cells, direct carbon fuel
cells, and hydrogen fuel cells. Large parts of the discussion below are valid
for all types, however, when it comes to evaluation of the equations, we shall
consider only hydrogen fuel cells with the overall reaction
</p>
<p>H2 +
1
</p>
<p>2
O2 ⇋ H2O . (26.1)
</p>
<p>Figure 26.1 shows a schematic of a hydrogen fuel cell. Hydrogen and oxy-
gen (pure or with air) are supplied to the two sides of the fuel cell in transport
channels, and enter gas diffusion layers (GDL) through which they travel to-
wards the catalyst layer. The GDL shields the gas from the electrolyte, and
contributes to the management of water flows within the cell. The electro-
chemical reactions take place in the catalyst layers at anode and cathode.
These are separated by an electrolyte through which electrons cannot pass.
The electrons move from anode to cathode through the electrical device (with
resistance Rd) and provide the power Ẇ to run the device. At the same time
ions move through the electrolyte.
</p>
<p>The reactions at anode and cathode, and the transport processes through
the electrolyte depend on the type of electrolyte.

4 + 3H
</p>
<p>++ water), or polyelectrolyte membranes (PEM), which
are polymers with sulfuric acid groups (polymer +SO&minus;3 +H
</p>
<p>++ water). At the
anode, the incoming hydrogen is split into electrons, e&minus;, and protons, H+.
The protons travel through the electrolyte to the cathode, while the electrons
pass through the device. At the cathode, protons, electrons and the incoming
oxygen react to water, which must be removed from the electrolyte.
</p>
<p>In alkaline electrolyte fuel cells, see Fig. 26.3, the electrolyte is a base,
e.g., potassium hydroxide (K+ +OH&minus;+ water). At the anode, the incoming
hydrogen reacts with hydroxide, OH&minus;, to form water and electrons, which
travel through the electrical device to the cathode. At the cathode, the elec-
trons and the incoming oxygen react with water to form hydroxide, that then
travels through the electrolyte to the anode, while half of the water produced
at the anode travels through the electrolyte to replenish the water consumed
in the cathode reaction.
</p>
<p>In both types of fuel cells, the ion and electron movement is forced by the
electric potential V between cathode and anode.

<p>26.2 Fuel Cell Potential

between acidic and alkaline fuel cells. We consider the mass and energy flows

<p>For most of our discussion, the system to be considered is just the fuel cell.
For the evaluation we shall assume that all inflows and outflows take place at
the homogeneous fuel cell temperature T . Additional irreversible processes
(external losses) might occur outside the fuel cell, e.g., in the heating of the
incoming oxygen and hydrogen, or in the heat transfer Q̇ between the fuel
cell and its exterior environment.

<p>In order to guarantee sufficient supply of fuel and oxidizer to the gas diffusion
layers at all locations along the gas channels, one normally will have excess
hydrogen and oxygen which are circulated back to the inlet (at least the
hydrogen).
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.3 Fuel Cell Efficiency 567
</p>
<p>that the Gibbs free energy of reaction is the maximum amount of work that
can be obtained per mole of fuel. This work could be obtained from a fully
reversible fuel cell, where Vover = 0.
</p>
<p>When the electron circuit is interrupted, reactions cannot take place, and
accordingly no irreversible processes occur. In this case one measures the
open circuit voltage between anode and cathode,1
</p>
<p>V0 = &minus;
∆ḡR

</p>
<p>. (26.9)
</p>
<p>At standard reference conditions, the open circuit potential of a hydrogen
fuel cell is V0 = 1.23V . Higher voltages, and thus higher powers, are obtained
by connecting several cells in series, to form fuel cell stacks.
</p>
<p>26.3 Fuel Cell Efficiency
</p>
<p>Efficiencies of engines are normally defined as
</p>
<p>η =
gain
</p>
<p>expense
, (26.10)
</p>
<p>where for power producing heat engines the gain is the power produced, and
the expense is the heat put into the engine through the combustion of fuel,
nuclear reactions, etc. Fuel cells are not heat engines, and thus the question
arises how to best define their efficiency. The gain is the power produced,
hence this is a question of defining the expense.
</p>
<p>For comparison of heat engines and fuel cells the following definition is of-
ten used: In a combustion process one could obtain the heat Q̇C = &minus;Λ∆h̄R =
&minus; I2F ∆h̄R. Considering this heat as the expense, one defines the &ldquo;thermal ef-
ficiency&rdquo; of a fuel cell as
</p>
<p>ηFCth =
Ẇ
</p>
<p>Q̇C
=
</p>
<p>&minus;∆ḡR &minus; 2FI T Ṡgen
&minus;∆h̄R
</p>
<p>. (26.11)
</p>
<p>With this definition, the perfect&mdash;i.e., reversible&mdash;fuel cell has the efficiency
</p>
<p>ηFCth =
&minus;∆ḡR
&minus;∆h̄R
</p>
<p>=
&minus;
(
</p>
<p>∆h̄R &minus; T∆s̄R
)
</p>
<p>&minus;∆h̄R
= 1&minus; T∆s̄R
</p>
<p>∆h̄R
. (26.12)
</p>
<p>For all fuels ∆h̄R &lt; 0, but there is no definite sign for the entropy of reaction
∆s̄R. For the hydrogen reaction,∆s̄R &lt; 0 and thus η
</p>
<p>FC
th &lt; 1 for reversible fuel
</p>
<p>cells (irreversible fuel cells have even smaller efficiencies, of course). However,
there are reactions, in particular the reaction between carbon and oxygen,
C +O2 ⇋ CO2, in direct carbon fuel cells, for which the entropy of reaction
</p>
<p>1 There is no current, so that I = 0 and Ẇ = 0.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>568 26 Thermodynamics of Fuel Cells
</p>
<p>is positive, ∆s̄R &gt; 0, so that η
FC
th as given in (26.11) becomes larger than
</p>
<p>unity. A proper efficiency measure should always assume values between zero
and unity. It follows that the efficiency definition (26.11) is not suitable for
the evaluation of fuel cells.
</p>
<p>In order to understand why this efficiency measure can be above unity, one
needs to consider that, according to the second law, the heat exchanged with
the surroundings for the reversible fuel cell is T∆s̄R. If T∆s̄R &lt; 0, heat is
rejected into the surroundings, but if T∆s̄R &gt; 0, heat is imported from the
surroundings.
</p>
<p>One should not be surprised that this efficiency definition leads to prob-
lems, since the heat of reaction, &minus;∆h̄R, is not relevant in the thermodynamics
of fuel cells, as is apparent in that it does not appear in the discussion of fuel
cell power and voltage. Heat of reaction is a quantity relevant only for com-
bustion systems.
</p>
<p>A more meaningful efficiency is the ratio of the actual power produced by
the fuel cell and the maximum power that could be obtained from the fuel,
in a fully reversible process. This leads to the second law efficiency,
</p>
<p>ηIIFC =
Ẇ
</p>
<p>Ẇrev
=
</p>
<p>V
</p>
<p>V0
= 1&minus; T Ṡgen
</p>
<p>(&minus;∆ḡR) I2F
, (26.13)
</p>
<p>which is always positive, and becomes unity only when all irreversibilities
vanish.
</p>
<p>When only the fuel cell is considered, ∆ḡR is to be evaluated at the fuel
cell temperature T . The following table shows the Gibbs free energy, the open
circuit voltage V0, and the ratio
</p>
<p>&minus;∆ḡR
&minus;∆h̄R of the hydrogen fuel cell as a function
</p>
<p>of temperature (product water is liquid for T = 25 ◦C, 80 ◦C and vapor for
higher temperatures2) at standard pressure p0:
</p>
<p>T &minus;∆ḡR V0 = &minus;∆ḡR2F
&minus;∆ḡR
&minus;∆h̄R
</p>
<p>25 ◦C 237.2 kJmol 1.23V 0.83
80 ◦C 228.2 kJmol 1.18V 0.80
100 ◦C 225.2 kJmol 1.17V 0.79
200 ◦C 220.4 kJmol 1.14V 0.77
400 ◦C 210.3 kJmol 1.09V 0.74
600 ◦C 199.6 kJmol 1.04V 0.70
800 ◦C 188.6 kJmol 0.98V 0.66
1000 ◦C 177.6 kJmol 0.92V 0.62
</p>
<p>All three quantities decrease with increasing temperature. Thus, if one con-
siders a fuel cell alone, one will gain more work at lower temperatures. High
temperature fuel cells, e.g. solid oxide fuel cells, operate at temperatures be-
tween 700 and 1000 ◦C, and thus have lower open circuit voltages than low
</p>
<p>2 For the Gibbs free enthalpy, this makes no difference!</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.3 Fuel Cell Efficiency 569
</p>
<p>temperature fuel cells. However, due to the high temperatures, the activation
losses (see below) are lower, and expensive catalysts are not required. More-
over, the heat rejected from high temperature fuel cells can be used to drive
heat engines in a combined cycle to produce additional power. If the heat is
barely rejected into the environment, there is an external loss.
</p>
<p>In other words, fuel cells must be imbedded into a system, where the fuel
cell is at the center, but additional systems for extracting work, heating and
cooling must be considered as well. In order to clarify this, Fig. 26.4 shows a
(reversible) fuel cell operating at temperature T as part of a fully reversible
external system, where the incoming fuel and oxidizer are heated to T by
a series of infinitesimal Carnot heat pumps, the heat Q̇FC rejected from
the fuel cell drives a Carnot heat engine, and the exhaust is cooled through
infinitesimal Carnot heat engines so that it leaves at T0. Of course, other
fully reversible set-ups are possible, e.g., some heat could be exchanged be-
tween the incoming reactant streams and the product stream, using reversible
counter-flow heat exchangers. Heat is only exchanged at environmental tem-
perature, and since all incoming and outgoing mass flows are at T0 and since
the system exchanges heat only at T0, and when all flows are at p0, the work
produced per mole of fuel is given by (25.18),
</p>
<p>Ẇrev = ẆFC + ẆC = &minus;ṅfuel∆ḡR (T0, p0) = &minus;
I
</p>
<p>2F
∆ḡR (T0, p0) . (26.14)
</p>
<p>Thus, the obvious definition of a second law efficiency for a fuel consuming
system is the relative amount of the work that is actually produced from the
available work, i.e.,
</p>
<p>ηIIsystem =
Ẇ
</p>
<p>Ẇrev

</p>
<p>To finish this section we present and criticize a misleading figure that is
sometimes found in the fuel cell literature. Figure 26.5 shows the thermal

</p>
<p>efficiency of a Carnot heat engine, ηC = 1&minus; T0T , both plotted over temperature
T . The Carnot efficiency ηC grows with temperature, while
</p>
<p>∆ḡR(T )

<p>∆h̄R(T )
decreases.
</p>
<p>The figure seems to imply that at higher temperatures fuel cell efficiency
might not be as good as the efficiency of a heat engine.

</p>
<p>This interpretation is misleading for two reasons: (a) As discussed above, a
high temperature fuel cell must be seen as one element in a larger system that
includes heat engines to convert the high temperature heat rejected from the
fuel cell and its exhaust. (b) The Carnot efficiency is relevant only for heat
engines operating between two reservoirs at constant temperatures T, T0. A
heat engine that is driven by the reaction of a fuel does not belong into that
category, and thus the Carnot efficiency is not necessarily relevant for a fuel
driven engine process.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.4 Nernst Equation 571
</p>
<p>The proper efficiency measure to compare fuel cell systems and heat en-
gines is the second law efficiency ηIIsystem, Eq. (26.15), which relates the actual
work produced to the maximum amount that could be produced in a fully re-
versible process. For real engines, this efficiency is below unity, due to entropy
generation in irreversible processes. As discussed in Sec. 25.12, combustion
engines suffer from losses in combustion, heat transfer, friction and mixing.
Fuel cells suffer from a different array of irreversible losses that will be dis-
cussed below. Whether or not a fuel cell system will have a higher efficiency
than a combustion system depends on the details of the design, materials
used, and the processes within the system.
</p>
<p>26.4 Nernst Equation
</p>
<p>The Nernst equation describes how the Gibbs free energy of reaction, and
thus open circuit voltage and power generation of a fuel cell, depends on the
pressures of the reactant and product streams. Indeed, so far we have only
considered the temperature dependence of ∆ḡR and implicitly assumed that
the flows are at reference pressure. Now we consider the more general case,
where the in- and outflows have different pressures pα.
</p>
<p>To simplify the argument, we assume that all streams are ideal gases, so
that s̄α (T, pα) = s̄
</p>
<p>0
α (T )&minus; R̄ ln pαp0 . As always, s̄
</p>
<p>0
α (T ) is the tabulated entropy
</p>
<p>at reference pressure p0. We recall the definitions ∆ḡR = ∆h̄R &minus; T∆s̄R with
∆h̄R =
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>α γαh̄α (T ) and ∆s̄R =
&sum;
</p>
<p>α γαs̄α (T, pα). This gives the Nernst
equation
</p>
<p>∆ḡR (T, pα) = ∆ḡR (T, p0) + R̄T ln
&prod;
</p>
<p>α
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>pα
p0
</p>
<p>)γα
</p>
<p>, (26.18)
</p>
<p>where the argument (T, pα) indicates that the in- and outflows are all at the
same temperature T , but at different pressures pα.
</p>
<p>For a hydrogen fuel cell in which the product is steam, the Nernst equation
gives the open circuit potential
</p>
<p>V0 =

<p>If the product water is liquid, the entropy of the water is independent of
pressure due to incompressibility, s̄H20 (T, pH2O) = s̄H20 (T ), and the open
circuit potential is

</p>
<p>These two equations show that the open circuit voltage can be increased by
supplying fuel (H2) and oxidizer (O2) at elevated pressures.When the product
is steam, lowering the steam pressure increases the open circuit voltage.
</p>
<p>26.5 Mass Transfer Losses
</p>
<p>The pressure considered in the Nernst equation above are the pressures at
which the inflows are supplied, and the outflows are removed, that is the
pressures in the transport channels. The transport of reactants and prod-
ucts through the porous gas diffusion layers leads to friction losses, and thus
generation of entropy as discussed in Sec. 9.7. Entropy generation and over-
potential associated with this loss will be determined next.
</p>
<p>The flow through the porous medium can be described by Darcy&rsquo;s law
(9.30) which we can write for mole flows as
</p>
<p>ṅα = K (pα,1 &minus; pα,2) , (26.21)
</p>
<p>where flow goes from pα,1 to pα,2; K is an overall transport parameter.
For ideal gases, the corresponding entropy generation rate (9.29) can be

<p>written in the equivalent forms3

<p>The relevant mole flows and pressures for a hydrogen fuel cell are depicted
in Fig. 26.6, where pα denotes the pressures in the gas channels, and p̃α
denotes the pressures at the catalyst layers. Note that hydrogen and oxygen
flow from the channels to the catalyst layer, while water flows in the opposite
direction. The mole flows are related to current as

H2 and O2 are entering the device, while the water leaves; all three expressions
are positive.

will be discussed below.
</p>
<p>In acidic fuel cells, water is produced at the cathode, and must be removed.
In low temperature fuel cells the produced water is liquid, and might clog
the pores of the gas diffusion layer, and even the gas channels. This reduces
the transport parameter K and the limiting current Ilimit. The air flow that
provides the oxygen must be dry enough, so that the product water can evap-
orate into the exhaust. The use of excess air increases the water intake, and
also guarantees sufficient oxygen pressures everywhere (see Nernst equation).
</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Nernst equation and the entropy generation
terms for transport can be combined to give the fuel cell potential as4

<p>This form of the equation shows that it is really the pressures p̃α at the
catalyst layers that are important. These however cannot be controlled, rather
they depend on the pressures pα in the gas channels and the current I as
expressed in (26.23). This dependence is explicit in the form (26.26), which
therefore must be used.
</p>
<p>26.6 Resistance Losses
</p>
<p>The ions travelling through the electrolyte between anode and cathode, and
the electrons forming the electrical current that provides electrical power, ex-
perience resistance in the media they move in. The overall internal resistance
of the fuel cell is denoted by Ri.
</p>
<p>Electrical resistance is an irreversible process, and we proceed by deter-
mining the corresponding entropy generation, for a resistor at steady state.
The resistor consumes work in form of electrical power Ẇ = &minus;V I = &minus;RiI2,
where I is the current and V is the voltage. The temperature of the resistor
is T , and first and second law reduce to
</p>
<p>0 = Q̇&minus; Ẇ , &minus; Q̇
T
</p>
<p>= Ṡgen &ge; 0 , (26.28)
</p>
<p>respectively. As done often before, first and second law are combined by
eliminating the heat, which here gives5

<p>Ṡgen = &minus;

<p>Electrical resistance produces entropy by downgrading electrical work to heat.
Thus, the voltage (26.8) of a fuel cell with resistance Ri is

<p>where the last term refers to other contributions to entropy generation.
In PEM fuel cells, a particular contribution to resistance loss is the drying-
</p>
<p>out of the membrane. The protons travelling from anode to cathode drag some
water along, and this water is removed together with the product water. Thus,
the membrane becomes somewhat dryer at the anode, and this reduces its
conductivity, i.e., increases the membrane resistance. A common method to

<p>5 Also here, the entropy generation can be considered as the product of a force
(the potential V ) and a flux (the current I). The linear relation between flux and
force, I = V/R, guarantees positive entropy generation.</p>

<p>26.7 Activation Overpotential 575
</p>
<p>deal with this problem is to moisturize the incoming hydrogen fuel, so that
new water is available at the anode.
</p>
<p>26.7 Activation Overpotential
</p>
<p>The third main cause for overpotential in fuel cells is activation loss. This
irreversible effect is related to finite reaction rates and activation barriers
at the reaction sites. The following discussion is based in part on the ideas
discussed in Sec. 24.
</p>
<p>At interfaces between different substances one observes electric poten-
tials, due to different charge distribution at the interface. Figure 26.7 shows
schematically the electric double layers that result at the interfaces between
catalyst layers and electrolyte at anode and cathode in a fuel cell. For the
sake of simplicity, the electrolyte at the interface is assumed to be electrically
neutral.
</p>
<p>The upper part of the figure shows anode and cathode potentials at open
circuit, denoted as Va,0 and Vc,0, with respect to an arbitrary reference, chosen
such that the anode potential is negative and the cathode potential is positive.
The overall cell potential at open circuit is V0 = Vc,0 &minus; Va,0.
</p>
<p>The lower part of the figure sketches the conditions at closed circuit: a
current flows and negative charges are removed from the anode, which be-
comes less negative, Va&minus;Va,0 &gt; 0. On the other side, the additional electrons
weaken the cathode potential, Vc &minus; Vc,0 &lt; 0.
</p>
<p>Due to reactions, new electrons are produced constantly at the anode, and
consumed at the cathode. When the current is low, the electrons withdrawn
are replaced through reactions, and the resulting change in the potentials is
small. When the current is large, at the anode electrons are not replaced fast
enough by reactions, and at the cathodes electrons are not consumed fast
enough, so that the absolute values of the potentials drop. Thus, the overall
potential of the cell, V = Vc &minus; Va, depends on the rate of reactions relative
to the current drawn.
</p>
<p>The activation overpotentials for anode and cathode are defined as
</p>
<p>ηa = Va &minus; Va,0 , ηc = Vc,0 &minus; Vc , (26.31)
</p>
<p>so that they both are positive, and the total overpotential is
</p>
<p>η = ηa + ηc = V0 &minus; V . (26.32)
</p>
<p>From the above discussion follows that the activation overpotential η should
be small for small current, and large for large current. We proceed to find
the relation between overpotential η and current I.
</p>
<p>The anode and cathode potentials are related to the Gibbs free energies
of reaction at anode and cathode as</p>

<p>The expressions in the exponentials are just those that occur in the 2nd law
expression for the overpotential (26.38). Replacing them with (26.39) finally
leads to the desired relation between current and overpotential, the Butler-
Volmer equation (Max Volmer, 1885-1965; John Butler, 1899-1977):

<p>])
</p>
<p>. (26.45)

cathode is obtained simply by switching signs, as

</p>
<p>. (26.46)
</p>
<p>For large overpotentials the exponential with negative argument can be
ignored against the exponential with positive argument; in this limit the
Butler-Volmer equation reduces to the so-called Tafel equation (Julius Tafel,
1862-1918), e.g., for the anode,

are plotted for a constant value for the parameter β. Both curves coincide at
larger η, where the approximation (26.47) is valid. The overpotential can be</p>

</p>
<p>According to the Butler-Volmer equation the activation overpotential will
be smaller for large exchange currents I0. For an efficient fuel cell one must
aim to make the exchange current large. According to (26.43), the exchange
current depends on an activation energy and on temperature. It grows with
temperature, so that activation losses are smaller for high temperature fuel
cells. The activation barriers ḡf , ḡb depend strongly on the electrode material:
good catalysts have low activation energies and thus low overpotential. For
a hydrogen electrode at T0, the following data for the exchange current per
unit area can be found in the literature:
</p>
<p>lead: Î0 = 2.5&times; 10&minus;13 Acm2 ,
nickel: Î0 = 6&times; 10&minus;6 Acm2 ,
platinum: Î0 = 5&times; 10&minus;4 Acm2 ,
palladium: Î0 = 4&times; 10&minus;3 Acm2 .
</p>
<p>The data indicates that expensive catalysts must be used at low tempera-
tures. The most common catalyst for low temperature fuel cells is platinum.
No catalysts are required for high temperature fuel cells. The total exchange
current of a fuel cell is proportional to the surface of the catalyst layer,
I0 = Î0Acatalyst. To reach sufficient catalyst area, the catalyst must be dis-
tributed well within the catalyst layer, e.g., as extremely small spheres.
</p>
<p>In hydrogen fuel cells, typically the reaction at the anode is considerably
slower than the reaction at the cathode. Then, the activation overpotential
at the cathode is small and can be ignored against the anode overpotential.</p>

<p>The power-current characteristic is shown in Fig. 26.12, based on the same
data as the first voltage curve, Fig. 26.10. A reversible fuel cell would deliver
the power V0I (continuous), but due to the various losses, the power curve
exhibits a maximum, and drops to zero at the limiting current. In order to
minimize the losses, a fuel cell should operate at currents well left of the
maximum, where the losses are relatively small. Note that the power loss is
the difference between the actual power curve and the reversible curve, and
grows non-linearly with current!

<p>26.9 Crossover Losses
</p>
<p>Even when the circuit is open, the observed potential lies below the open
circuit potential (which describes reversible operation). The common expla-
nation for this drop is the occurrence of electron crossover losses, due to
electrons that find a path through the electrolyte and travel from anode to
electrode without delivering electrical work. Thus, there is a certain number
of net reactions taking place which do not contribute to the useful current
Iused. The overall current I = 2FΛ, where Λ is the fuel consumption rate,
can be split into the useful current and the crossover current Ilost, so that
the voltage-current relation reads
</p>
<p>V =&minus;∆ḡR

</p>
<p>(26.50)
When plotted over the useful current for constant Ilost, the current scale is
merely shifted, Fig. 26.13 shows an example.
</p>
<p>Additional losses can occur due to fuel and oxidizer entering the electrolyte,
and reacting directly, without flow of electrons involved. This does not affect</p>

<p>the potential V of the fuel cell, nor the power drawn which still is Ẇ = V I,
but leads to additional heat developed by the fuel cell, and additional fuel
consumption.
</p>
<p>If the reaction rate of these reactions is Λc, the corresponding heat to be
removed from the fuel cell is Q̇c = &minus;Λc∆h̄R. This heat, if unused, leads to
external entropy generation, and waste of fuel.
</p>
<p>The work potential of the fuel consumed in crossover is &minus;Λc∆ḡR, and, since
this potential is not used, this is just the entropy generated in fuel crossover,
T Ṡcgen = &minus;Λc∆ḡR. The relation between power and entropy generation is
Ẇ = &minus;Λ∆ḡR&minus;T Ṡgen where Λ counts all reactions, i.e., the fuel consumption.
Accounting explicitly for the loss due to crossover, we have
</p>
<p>ẆFC = &minus;Λ∆ḡR + Λc∆ḡR &minus; T Ṡgen = &minus;ΛI∆ḡR &minus; T ṠIgen , (26.51)
</p>
<p>where ΛI = Λ &minus; Λc = I2F is the reaction rate for electrochemical reactions.
Moreover, T ṠIgen denotes the power loss due to all mechanisms discussed
above, excluding crossover loss. Thus, the expressions for fuel cell work of
the previous sections remain valid. Fuel crossover does not affect the voltage-
current curve, but leads to increased fuel consumption, and increased heat
transfer from the cell.
</p>
<p>The influence of crossover is best seen in the second law efficiency for the
fuel cell. The reversible work available from the fuel is Ẇrev = &minus;Λ∆ḡR where
the reaction rate Λ measures the amount of fuel used. With ΛI = Λ&minus;Λc the
second law efficiency becomes

<p>In fuel cells, hydrogen and oxygen combine to produce electrical energy and
water. In electrolyzers, the opposite takes place: electrical energy is used to
split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Figure 26.14 shows the basic reactions
taking place, and indicates the flows of hydrogen, oxygen, water, protons,
and electrons.

<p>The power consumption of the electrolyzer is ẆE = &minus;VEI and the amount
of hydrogen produced is equal to the reaction rate Λ = I/2F . Thus, the

<p>26.11 Hydrogen
</p>
<p>A common method to produce hydrogen is steam methane reforming, in
which hydrogen (H2) is split from natural gas (that is mainly methane, CH4)
according to the overall reaction CH4+2H2O &harr; 4H2+CO2. Larger quantities
of H2 are produced this way for NH3 production (see Sec. 23.10). This process
generates CO2 and thus is not carbon neutral. If the natural gas is used in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>586 26 Thermodynamics of Fuel Cells
</p>
<p>a combined cycle power plant with thermal efficiency of 60% (Sec. 13.6),
there will be less CO2 produced per kWh of electricity than if H2 from steam
methane reforming is used in a fuel cell.
</p>
<p>By means of electrolyzers, hydrogen can be produced from any primary
source of electrical power, including carbon neutral power sources like nuclear,
solar, wind, or tidal. As opposed to electricity, hydrogen can be stored and
distributed in pipelines and tanks, and therefore offers a means to store power
produced from intermittent sources (solar, wind, tidal).
</p>
<p>The stored hydrogen can be reconverted into electricity either in traditional
combustion systems (e.g. combined cycle power plants, Atkinson cycle), or
in fuel cells. The latter offer an elegant and efficient means to use power
produced by stationary non-carbon power plants (solar, wind, . . . ) for trans-
portation (cars, trucks, busses, trains, . . . ). The use of hydrogen produced by
carbon neutral energy sources could play a role in the future energy system,
which must aim to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon
dioxide.
</p>
<p>Due to irreversibilities, only a portion of the energy fed into the electrolyzer
is retrieved from the fuel cell. Moreover, one needs to account for the efficiency
of processes required to store and distribute the hydrogen. Indeed, at normal
conditions hydrogen is a gas which, due to its low molar mass, assumes a
relatively large specific volume. In particular for use as transportation fuel,
the hydrogen needs to be compacted, either by compression of the gas, or
by liquefaction. The (irreversible) processes involved can be described by a
storage and distribution efficiency measure ηIISD.
</p>
<p>With the second law efficiencies for electrolyzer, storage and distribution,
and fuel cell, the ratio between the power provided by the fuel cell, ẆFC ,
and the power ẆE which was consumed to produce the hydrogen in the
electrolyzer, is
</p>
<p>ẆFC
</p>
<p>ẆE
= ηIIFCη
</p>
<p>II
SDη
</p>
<p>II
E . (26.59)

<p>Typical values for these efficiencies are ηIIFC = 0.6, η
II
SD = 0.75, η
</p>
<p>II
E = 0.6,
</p>
<p>so that only 27% of the energy provided at the source is finally recovered.
Doubtless, new materials and better designs will lead to efficiency improve-
ments in the future. Meanwhile, other storage concepts might have higher
efficiencies, e.g., batteries or pumped hydro.

</p>
<p>MCFC can work with carbon monoxide (CO) as fuel. Then the anode
reaction occurs in two steps, first the water gas shift reaction, followed by
reaction of the generated hydrogen with the carbonate ion, CO2&minus;3 . The reac-
tions occurring are:
</p>
<p>Anode: CO + H2O �&rarr; H2 +CO2 , H2 +CO2&minus;3 �&rarr; H2O+CO2 ,
Cathode: 12O2 +CO2 + 2e
