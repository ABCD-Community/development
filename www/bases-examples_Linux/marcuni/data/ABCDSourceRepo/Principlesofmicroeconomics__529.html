<p>Acknowledgements
</p>
<p>One may wonder why I think that it makes sense to add yet another introductory
textbook to the overfilled shelf of well-established books on microeconomics. There
are three reasons that motivated me to do so.
</p>
<p>First, a lot of textbooks in economics want to make one believe that the theories
presented are more or less context-free and objective. This is a wrong and dangerous
belief. First of all, all theories are embedded in an intellectual milieu from which
they borrow and on which they build. No man is an island, and no scientific theory
is either. The tendency to shun any contextualisations of the theories comes at the
risk of blindness towards the implicit assumptions, value judgements and epistemes
on which the theory depends. This makes economics prone to being misused for
ideological purposes. Economic literacy does not only mean that one is able to un-
derstand the rules and patterns of modern economies, but also that one understands
how economic theories relate to other social sciences and the culture from which
they emerge. This textbook is an attempt to contextualize modern economics in the
hope that students will get a better overview of its strengths and weaknesses. It puts
also a specific emphasis on case studies that range widely from the functioning of
coffee markets, the logic of overfishing, to price discrimination in the digital age.
This approach makes this book also potentially interesting for students who study
economics as a minor and who want to understand how economic theories relate to
other social sciences and how they can be used to better understand markets as well
as phenomena like climate change, among many others.
</p>
<p>To make it easier to identify the most important contextualizations in this book, I
work with a series of icons that one will find in the margins of this book. L indicates
a legal, B a business, and ˆ a philosophical (broadly speaking) context. Further-
more, one will find the most important definitions and technical terms highlighted
with a ✍-sign in the margins of the book.
</p>
<p>Second, textbooks that give an introduction to economics have become a million-
dollar business over the last decades, with thousands of universities and colleges
teaching the same basic principles worldwide. The globalization of this market
has led to a commodification of textbooks in the attempt to sell as many copies as
possible. As a result, the lion&rsquo;s share of the market is served by textbooks that are
</p>

</p>
<p>very elementary and only scratch the surface of most theories. This strategy makes
them commercially successful, because of the appeal to the mass market but, at the
same time, denies the students a deeper and more sophisticated understanding of
the strengths and weaknesses of the theories. One could argue that such an in-depth
understanding of theories is not necessary in an introductory class in economics,
because there will be plenty of intermediate and advanced courses that will fill these
gaps later on. The reality is, however, that a significant fraction of students gets all
of its knowledge from the introductory course. It is never too early to educate
independent and critical minds.
</p>
<p>Third, most textbooks that I am aware of are not tailored to the needs of a busi-
ness school where students study economics, business administration and maybe
law. Economics is about the functioning of institutions and most institutions have
a legal backbone. Bringing this fact to the foreground creates synergies between
law and economics. By the same token, economic theory allows one to identify
the key parameters that a firm must know in order to be successful in the mar-
kets in which they compete. Examining the common ground between management
and economics allows one to better understand the implications of different market
contexts and industries for managers and it shows one how closely economics and
business administration can and should be linked. Economics, law and business
administration are really three perspectives on the same phenomenon: the logic of
social interaction.
</p>
<p>This book took shape over many years during which I have been teaching &ldquo;Prin-
ciples of Economics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Microeconomics&rdquo; to undergraduate students. I would
like to thank all of my former students for their patience and for their countless
discussions that all contributed, in their own ways, to this book. Special thanks are
due to my present and former PhD students and research assistants Philipp Den-
ter, Magnus Hoffmann, Hendrik Rommeswinkel and Dana Sisak, all of whom had
a major influence on the content and the didactics of this book. This is also true
for Thomas Beschorner, Friedrich Breyer, Claudia Fichtner, J&uuml;rg Furrer, Michael
Heumann, Normann Lorenz, Ingo Pies, Alfonso Sousa-Poza and Andreas Wagener,
who gave me me detailed feedback on earlier versions of the book and helped me
with valuable suggestions. I would also like to thank Maya G. Davies, Corinne
Kn&ouml;pfel, Leopold Lerach, Jan Riss and Jan Serwart, who supported me in finishing
this book and who did a great job in making it more student friendly and accessi-
ble. It is definitely not their fault if you find yourself struggling with some of the
material.

status and scientific role of economic theories.

<p>� the basic paradigm of economics: to understand the functioning of societies as

<p>1.1 What Is Economics About?
</p>
<p>Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and
scarce means which have alternative uses. (Lionel Robbins)
</p>
<p>If one looks at economics departments all over the world, one may be surprised
to see what economists are doing. Of course, economists deal with &ldquo;the economy,&rdquo;
but modern economics is extremely diverse and covers a wide range of fields, which
few laymen would intuitively associate with economics. Here is a list of examples:
economists deal with the &ldquo;big old&rdquo; questions about the sources of growth and busi-
ness cycles, poverty and the effects of unemployment, or the effects of monetary
policy on the economy. More generally, they want to find out how markets allocate
goods and resources and how markets have to be regulated in order to make sure that
they function properly. An important field of research is the economic role of the
government: the ways it can levy taxes and provide services. However, economists
also deal with problems related to political institutions, like the effects of different
voting systems, the causes and consequences of political and military conflicts, or
the relationship between different levels of government. They are involved in evolu-
tionary biology, the design of products on financial markets, auctions, and internet

<p>4 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>market platforms; they work with lawyers to understand the consequences of legal
rules and cooperate with philosophers.
</p>
<p>The reason for this diversity of fields stems from the evolution of the modern
definition of the science of economics. Economics is not the science that studies
&ldquo;the economy:&rdquo; it is not defined by an object of study. Instead, it defines itself
by a particular perspective from which it tries to make sense of the social world:
scarcity. Paul A. Samuelson (1948), one of the most influential economists of the
20th century, provided what is still the most concise definition of economics: &ldquo;Eco-
nomics is the study of how men and society choose, with or without the use of
money, to employ scarce productive resources which could have alternative uses,
to produce various commodities over time and distribute them for consumption,
now and in the future among various people and groups of society.&rdquo; This definition
may not be as elegant as the one by Lionel Robbins, but it has the advantage of
larger concreteness: economists try to understand how resources are used to allevi-
ate scarcity. Economics is therefore a scientific method: economists start with the
premise that it is possible to understand the logic of individual behavior and collec-
tive action as a result of scarcity. This is why the above list of examples covers such
a broad array of fields. Whenever one has the conjecture that scarcity plays a role
in the functioning of a situation, economists can be brought on board.
</p>
<p>But what is scarcity?✍ Scarcity refers to situations where the wants exceed the
means. In economics, the wants are usually restricted to human wants, and means
includes the resources and goods that contribute to fulfilling these wants. The ref-
erence to wants implies that scarcity has its origin in human physiology as well as
psychology. The human metabolism requires a certain intake of energy in order to
function and, if food intake falls below a certain threshold, human beings cannot
develop and will eventually become sick and die. These physiological wants can
be called objective, and their fulfilment is indispensable for life. However, a lot of
wants are not of this type. Fast cars, big houses, and fancy clothes are not necessary
for healthy survival, but are merely pleasant. These wants can be called subjec-
tive. Economics is the study of how individuals and societies manage goods and
resources, which can be objectively as well as subjectively scarce.
</p>
<p>Digression 1. Increasing Means or Increasing Autonomy?ˆ
Economics has no monopoly on scarcity as a starting point for the scientific
endeavor. Philosophies like Buddhism start from a similar premise, although
phrased in a different terminology. The first two of the so-called &ldquo;Four Noble
Truths&rdquo; state that (1) dhukka exists and (2) that it arises from one&rsquo;s attachment
to desires. Dhukka is often translated as suffering, but this blurs its meaning.
It refers to misaligned desires and needs or, in other words, scarcity.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to see, however, that the impulse that resulted from this
same premise points in opposite directions. Most &ldquo;Western&rdquo; economists try
to find out how scarcity can be alleviated by increasing means (through tech-
nological progress, growth, etc.). The intuitive reaction to the phenomenon</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.1 What Is Economics About? 5
</p>
<p>of scarcity points outwards: increasing the means to fulfill the given wants.
This impulse is even reflected in the idea of individual freedom that is, by
and large, conceptualized in the Western tradition as political freedom: as the
absence of external compulsion.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, the reaction to scarcity in Buddhism points inwards: over-
coming the wants to make them match the means. To see this, consider the
two other noble truths: (3) suffering ceases when attachment to desire ceases
and (4) freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the Eightfold Path.
Freedom, according to this view, is interior freedom: autonomy from the &ldquo;dic-
tatorship&rdquo; of desires. One sees the same starting point, but two completely
different conclusions.
</p>
<p>Scarcity ✍immediately leads to one of the most powerful tools of economics: the
concept of opportunity cost. If one makes decisions under the conditions of scarcity,
then going one way necessarily implies that one cannot go another way. On the
other hand, the other way looks interesting, as well, so deciding to go this way
incurs a cost, in this sense. To be a little more specific, assume that one has to
choose an alternative a from a set of admissible alternatives A and assume further
that one can rank the admissible alternatives according to the joy and fulfillment
that one is expecting to experience when one chooses them. If a1 is the best and a2
is the second-best alternative, according to this measure, then the opportunity costs
of choosing a1 is the joy and fulfillment that one would have expected to enjoy from
alternative a2.
</p>
<p>This sounds rather abstract, but it need not be. The concept of opportunity cost
allows one to better understand how one makes decisions and how one should make
decisions (this distinction will be discussed in more depth later). If one goes to the
movies, one cannot go to a restaurant; if one spends one&rsquo;s money on a new car,
one cannot afford an expensive trip to Japan; if one studies Economics, one cannot,
at the same time, study Physics; and so on. In order to make the right decisions,
one should be aware of the value one attaches to the other alternatives that one
cannot realize. The value one connects to the next-best alternative forgone is the
opportunity cost of one&rsquo;s choice.
</p>
<p>Digression 2. Generosity for Nerds: Opportunity Costs and Donations ˆ
The concept of opportunity costs is helpful when considering the conse-
quences of any kind of behavior. To illustrate this point, I would like to focus
on a recent trend called effective altruism, sometimes also called &ldquo;generosity
for nerds.&rdquo; Effective altruism seeks to maximize the good from one&rsquo;s charita-
ble donations. Here is an example that illustrates the problem. Assume that
one graduates and wants to make a great difference in the world by devoting
one&rsquo;s career to doing something good. A lot of students with this type of mo-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>tivation consider careers at Oxfam, or some other charity. However, this may
not be the smartest idea. Assume that one would earn CHF 50,000 with a job
at a charity and could be replaced by some other graduate student, who does
an equally good job. Now, assume that one considers a career at a major bank,
where one would earn CHF 120,000 instead and then gives CHF 70,000 away
to charity. This decision creates CHF 70,000 that can be used for doing good.
In fact, it finances the position at Oxfam and still leaves CHF 20,000 for other
charitable purposes. If the person replacing one at Oxfam does not have this
career option, it is better if one works for the bank, even if it seems to contra-
dict one&rsquo;s intentions of devoting one&rsquo;s life to doing good. (But please, make
sure to actually donate the money!)
</p>
<p>The importance of this example is not the career advice that it provides,
but the principle that can be elicited from it. Consider a simple version of this
problem in which one wants to donate a certain amount of money and wants
to make sure that it does as much good as possible. Effective altruism makes
the point that one should think in terms of opportunity costs when one makes
one&rsquo;s decision: what are the alternative uses for one&rsquo;s money and how much
good could be done with the different uses? One should then spend one&rsquo;s
next Swiss Franc in a way that would maximize the additional good that the
money can create.
</p>
<p>This idea of donations may look like economics on steroids but, in fact, it is
an important regulative idea to alleviate suffering. There is a lot of evidence,
for example, that donations are highly irrational. Disaster relief following
earthquakes and tsunamis is a good example. These events are horrible and
create a lot of human suffering. However, media attention often creates &ldquo;su-
perstar effects,&rdquo; where people want to help and thereby crowd out other needs.
In the end, earthquake-relief programs end up with more money than they can
usefully spend to alleviate the suffering from the earthquake. To illustrate, if
everyone spends a fixed amount of money on charitable projects, then one ad-
ditional Swiss Franc for earthquake relief reduces the money that is available
for less prominent (but equally urgent) projects. Some charities are aware
of this problem and want to use part of the earmarked donations for other
projects, but they are often criticized for doing so, because the people want
to make sure that their money is spent &ldquo;in the right way.&rdquo; On the other hand,
what is the right way to spend their money? If saving an additional life in the
earthquake region is expected to cost CHF 50,000 and it will likely cost CHF
10,000, if the money is spent on malaria prevention in some low-key project,
then it may make sense to apply economic principles to save as many lives
as possible. Thinking in terms of opportunity cost allows for a more rational
allocation of scarce resources from a utilitarian perspective.</p>

<p>1.1 What Is Economics About? 7
</p>
<p>When economists study social phenomena, they usually distinguish between
three different levels of analysis:
</p>
<p>� Individual level: The individual level focuses on the question of how individual
people behave under conditions of scarcity. A typical question is, for example,
how a person spends his or her income on consumption. Will she go to the
movies or to dinner? Will she spend her income on clothes or travel? Decision-
theory is the field of research that develops theories about individual behavior.
</p>
<p>� Interaction level: Typically, individual behavior does not take place in isolation.
If A decides to go to the movies tonight, and B would like to meet A, then B must
go to the movies, as well. Equilibrium models of trade and market behavior or
game theory are examples of fields of research that investigate how human beings
interact with each other.
</p>
<p>� Aggregate level: Phenomena that are studied at the aggregate level are, for
example, inflation, growth, or unemployment. They are a result of individual
decisions and the rules that govern individual interactions, but an analysis of a
certain phenomenon at the aggregate level usually abstracts from a lot of the de-
tails of individual decision-making and interactions in order to still be able to see
the forest for the trees.
</p>
<p>I have ✍already mentioned that individual human beings ultimately cause all social
phenomena at the aggregate or interaction levels. Methodological individualism is
a scientific position that requires that all social phenomena be explained with ref-
erence to individual behavior. According to this view, it is not sufficient to assume
that abstract laws exist, which explain, for example, growth and inflation: these
laws must be derived from the behavior of individuals in a society. Methodologi-
cal individualism is a widely recognized position among economists, according to
which ultimately all phenomena, which are studied on the aggregate level, need to
be traced back to patterns of behavior on the individual and interaction levels.
</p>
<p>Digression 3. Homo Oeconomicus
</p>
<p>Economics is infamous for a character that populates most of its tales: the
homo oeconomicus. Any theory that explains social phenomena as a result of
individual behavior needs a decision theory that allows for the making of pre-
dictions. The term homo oeconomicus summarizes a number of assumptions
about the way individuals make the decisions that are used in mainstream
economics to make predictions about behavior.
</p>
<p>Different economists use the term differently, but there is a broad consen-
sus that the minimum requirements are as follows: first, economists usually
do not use the concept to explain the motivations that drive behavior in an ex-
clusively descriptive way. This approach goes back to Vilfredo Pareto, John
Hicks, Roy Allen, and Paul Samuelson, who eliminated psychological con-
cepts from economics and based economic theory on principles of rational</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>choice. The idea is that all one can observe are individual choices, but not the
mental processes that motivate or cause behavior.
</p>
<p>All one has to know is that people make decisions in a structured way that
allows one to infer a so-called preference relation from the observed behavior
of the individuals. This is the revealed-preference approach in economics,
which makes the point that, if behavior follows certain consistency assump-
tions, then the individual behaves as if she maximizes her preferences or her
utility function. Note that the formulation says &ldquo;as if,&rdquo; which implies that the
theory does not claim that individuals have preferences or utility functions
somewhere in their heads. Pareto justified this approach in a letter from 1897:
&ldquo;It is an empirical fact that the natural sciences have progressed only when
they have taken secondary principles as their point of departure, instead of
trying to discover the essence of things. [. . . ] Pure political economy has
therefore a great interest in relying as little as possible on the domain of psy-
chology.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The consistency assumptions, which guarantee that an individual behaves
as if she maximizes preferences, are as follows: she can rank the alternatives
from which she can choose according to some relation representing her pref-
erences (if I have the choice between broccoli and potato chips, then I prefer
broccoli to potato chips). This ranking is unique and stable over a sufficiently
long period of time. Furthermore, the ranking is complete (I can rank any
two alternatives) and transitive (if I prefer broccoli to potato chips and potato
chips to ice cream, then I also prefer broccoli to ice cream). Such prefer-
ences are called an ordering. Last but not least, it is assumed that individuals
always choose the best alternative that is available to them (maximization).
The maximization of a preference ordering is the core of the rational-choice
paradigm, which is integral to the concept of homo oeconomicus.
</p>
<p>Please note that this view on rationality is purely instrumental: it refers to
the consistency of a ranking and the relationship between ranking and behav-
ior. (If preferences are inferred from behavior, then there is conceptionally
no gap between behavior and preferences; the latter are a workaround to sys-
temize choices.) It can be discussed whether completeness and transitivity
capture the idea of rationality and if individuals always choose an alternative
that is best for them, but both assumptions are considered indispensable for
rational decision-making. The concept has been further refined to be able to
cover choice situations under conditions of risk and uncertainty.
</p>
<p>It is a widespread misunderstanding that homo oeconomicus is conceptu-
alized as a selfish actor. Given that the above concept wants to eliminate any
deliberations about motives for action from the theory, it cannot, in its purest
form, say anything about selfishness, altruism, or fairness concerns, because
these concepts refer to the individual&rsquo;s motives for taking action. Admittedly,
a lot of authors added assumptions about the structure of a preference order-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.1 What Is Economics About? 9
</p>
<p>ing that can be interpreted as selfishness to the theory, but it should be noted
that selfishness is not an integral part of what economists conceptualize as
rationality.
</p>
<p>A detailed discussion of the concept of homo oeconomicus is beyond the
scope of an introductory chapter, but some remarks are important. The dif-
ferent aspects of the concept have been subject to critique. Psychologists
and behavioral economists have shown that preferences need not be transitive
and that individuals do not consistently choose alternatives that are best for
them (a statement that cannot even be made within the revealed-preference
paradigm). Furthermore, people do not act selfishly in a number of situations.
Despite these empirical anomalies, the concept is popular in economics. From
a methodological point of view, it is important as a regulative idea that helps
one to better understand the structure of limited rationality and non-selfish
behavior, even if everyone agrees that real people often deviate from the ideal
of rational decision-making. Boundedly rational behavior follows patterns
and it is easier to explore these patterns with reference to the standard of full
rationality. In addition, as will become clear throughout this chapter, good
theories do not rely on &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; assumptions in a na&iuml;ve understanding of
the word. The predictive power of a theory that, for example, explains the
behavior of prices in markets can be high, even if the underlying assumptions
abstract from a lot of factors that may be important in reality.
</p>
<p>Claiming scarcity as the exclusive paradigm of economics would be imperialistic
and wrong without further deliberation. The definitions of economics by Robbins
(1932) and Samuelson are vague about the exact role that human beings play in
economic theory. Methodological individualism is what, for the most part, distin-
guishes mainstream economics from other sciences that are also built on the idea of
scarcity.
</p>
<p>Evolutionary biology is a good example. Evolution in populations is the result of
three basic principles: (1) There are traits that are heritable, (2) there is variability
in them, and (3) some traits are more adaptive than others, which implies that the
organisms pass more copies of their genes on to the next generation. The crucial
point is that a mismatch between means and ends must be underlying the &ldquo;mechan-
ics&rdquo; of evolution, because otherwise traits could reproduce indefinitely. Therefore,
to get the theory of evolution off the ground, one has to start from scarcity. What
distinguishes evolutionary biology from economics is not the underlying paradigm,
but the smallest unit of study, genes versus human beings, and it would be prepos-
terous to declare evolutionary biology as part of economics (even though there is
a subfield of economics called evolutionary economics that applies the above three
principles to study economic phenomena and to lay the foundations for human be-
havior). Evolutionary biologists distinguish between ultimate and proximate causes.
According to this view, the human brain, with its desires and preferences and, more
generally, a human being is a proximate cause of behavior, shaped by forces of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>evolution. It is an organism that makes its genes more or less well-adapted to its
environment. The laws of genetic evolution are, therefore, the ultimate causes of
human behavior. Economists recognize that human brains are ultimately shaped by
evolution, but nevertheless take the individual human being as the ultimate cause
of behavior and as the starting point of their scientific endeavor. As shown in the
next subchapter, this shortcut is neither right nor wrong, good nor bad: it merely
simplifies the analysis.
</p>
<p>Another common distinction is made between microeconomics and macroeco-
nomics. Microeconomists study individual decision-making at the individual and
interaction levels, whereas macroeconomists study economic phenomena at the ag-
gregate level. The distinction is, however, not as sharp as it may seem. Traditional
macroeconomics postulated regularities for aggregates like national savings, which
were then used to predict the consequences of, for example, an increase in economic
growth. One could find in the data that about 30% of national income Y goes into
savings S , which would yield a savings function S.Y / D 0:3 � Y . Combined with
other regularities of this kind, such a function can be used, for example, for eco-
nomic forecasting. The problem with this approach is, however, that it remains
unexplained why, on average, 30% of national income goes into savings. It is not
a theory that fulfills the requirements of methodological individualism. In the end,
it is the single individual that makes savings decisions, so the implications of such
aggregate models of the economy are more reliable if the behavior of aggregates
is linked to individuals. This observation led to the so-called micro-foundation of
macroeconomics, i.e. the attempt to relate aggregate phenomena, like unemploy-
ment or growth, to individual decision-making. Mainstream macroeconomics is
micro-founded in this sense, so it is more appropriate to distinguish between micro
and macro, as they are colloquially called, by their fields of application. Macro-
economists usually study phenomena like growth, unemployment, business cycles
or monetary policy, whereas microeconomists focus on the functioning of markets
and other institutions or the role and design of incentives in economic decision-
making, among other things.

<p>1.2 SomeMethodological Remarks
</p>
<p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. (Attributed to Albert
Einstein)
</p>
<p>There are cookbooks and scientific theories. In a cookbook, one learns that it takes
a hot pan, eggs, flour, milk, baking soda and a pinch of salt to make pancakes.
If one follows the recipe, one ends up with a tasty meal, but one does not really
understand why. A scientific theory tells one how heat changes the molecular struc-
ture of proteins present in egg white, how baking soda reacts with acids and how
gluten builds elastic networks. This knowledge may not inform one about how to
make a pancake, but it can tell one a lot about the deeper reasons why the recipe
works. Moreover, one can use this information to develop new, innovative recipes.
Both cookbooks and scientific theories complement each other: understanding the</p>

<p>1.2 Some Methodological Remarks 11
</p>
<p>physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms underlying the transformation of in-
gredients into meals helps one improve recipes, and the evolved recipes are a source
of inspiration for scientific discoveries.
</p>
<p>Economics comes in the form of both cookbooks and scientific theories. A stock-
broker may just &ldquo;follow his gut&rdquo; about profitable picks. He has no explicit theories
about the functioning of capital markets in the back of his mind, which inform him
about the future development of stocks. Like an experienced cook, he just &ldquo;feels&rdquo;
or &ldquo;sees&rdquo; which stocks will be profitable. Scientific reasoning would require try-
ing to understand the mechanisms that make one stock successful and the other a
failure. Alternatively, take the manager of a firm as an example. When she sets up
the organization of the firm and the compensation packages for the employees, she
might follow custom and her intuition. The scientific approach to organization and
compensation would be to develop theories about the consequences or organiza-
tional designs and the incentive effects of different ways to compensate employees.
These theories might not be directly applicable to a specific problem but, over time,
they feed into the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; of a society and shape the intuitions of decision-makers.
John Maynard Keynes made this point quite poignantly: &ldquo;The ideas of economists
and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong are
more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little
else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellec-
tual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct economist.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Economics, as a social science, develops such theories. It is not the primary pur-
pose of these theories to inform decision-makers about the consequences of their
decisions, but rather to give one a better understanding of the logic of economic
interactions by developing scientific theories. Deepening one&rsquo;s understanding of
the functioning of, for example, labor or financial markets will, in the end, allow
decision-makers to make better decisions, but this is only a byproduct of the en-
deavor.
</p>
<p>The following subchapters give a short introduction to some philosophical issues
that are important for understanding economics as a social science. It is very dif-
ficult to find the right point in time to discuss these fundamental issues because, if
one discusses them before one starts studying economics, then one discusses issues
that are still very abstract; one gives answers to questions that the students would
not even have asked. If one covers the material at the end of a course, then stu-
dents will have difficulty understanding what is going on in economic theories and
it is very likely that they will be led astray in their ideas about their relevance and
potential. The third option is also suboptimal: integrating the philosophical debate
into the presentation of the theories. If one sprinkles economic theories with little
bits of the philosophy of science here and there, it is very likely that one will miss
the forest for the trees. (The fourth option would, of course, be to skip the material
completely and to rely on the methodological and philosophical intuitions of the
students.) This is why I have decided to cover some ground at the beginning of
this book, with the idea that one need not understand every little detail after the first
reading. It is good enough if one gets the basic concept in the beginning and then re-</p>

All the bits and pieces will fall into place eventually if one perseveres.
</p>
<p>1.2.1 True and Reasonable Theories
</p>
<p>I used✍ the term scientific theory in the last subchapter. For the purposes of this text,
a theory is defined as a relatively broad conceptual approach that makes reasonable
conjectures about causal relationships in the world.
</p>
<p>When is a conjecture reasonable and why does one find the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;true&rdquo; in the above statement? Given the limitations of one&rsquo;s sense-
organs and one&rsquo;s mind, it is impossible to say that a conjecture is true in the sense
that it is in total accordance with reality. A nice way to briefly grasp the epistemic
problems that come with a na&iuml;ve idea of truth is a short elaboration of the so-called
M&uuml;nchhausen Trilemma. The basic problem is that scientific reasoning requires that
one is prepared to provide proof for any of one&rsquo;s statements. However, such a proof
can only be given by means of another statement, which must also be provable. The
M&uuml;nchhausen trilemma makes the point that one has the choice between exactly
three unsatisfactory options to deal with this situation:
</p>
<p>� Infinite regress: Each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum. This process
will, of course, never end, such that one never &ldquo;breaks through&rdquo; to the truth. It
is, understandably, impossible to give an example for an infinite regress.
</p>
<p>� Circularity: The statement and the proof support each other, maybe in a com-
plex chain of arguments. An example is a flawed interpretation of the theory of
evolution that defines the species that fits best in an environment as the one that
survives, and then one argues that the species one observes must fit best into its
environment.
</p>
<p>� Dogmatism: One finally reaches a stage in the process of statement and proof,
where the underlying assumptions have no further justification. A wonderful
example of dogmatism is the second sentence of the US Declaration of Indepen-
dence, even if it is not a scientific theory: &ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with cer-
tain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>For all practical intents and purposes, only dogmatism is an option. That means
that truth cannot be achieved by a process of scientific reasoning, but necessar-
ily relies on intuition that must be nurtured by other sources. Dogmatism, for the
same reason, also implies that every scientific theory must start from value judg-
ments about the basic, self-evident principles. Coming back to the discussion about
theories, calling a conjecture reasonable bites the trilemma-bullet by requiring the
much more moderate standard of being consensual. Ludwig Wittgenstein (1972,
94 and 110) expressed this beautifully: &ldquo;But I did not get my picture of the world
by satisfying myself of its correctness; nor do I have it because I am satisfied of its</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Some Methodological Remarks 13
</p>
<p>correctness. No: it is the inherited background against which I distinguish between
true and false. [. . . ] As if giving grounds did not come to an end sometime. But
the end is not an ungrounded presupposition: it is an ungrounded way of acting.&rdquo; In
order to reach a consensus among experts, one must at least reach an agreement of
the different dogmas that (perhaps subconsciously) taint one&rsquo;s own perspective.
</p>
<p>Digression 4. Transcending Reason ˆ
The necessity of a dogmatic starting point of any scientific research project
points towards the limits of language in expressing reality. Some spiritual
traditions even claim that some truths can and must be assessed by means
other than scientific reasoning &ndash; for example an act of revelation &ndash; and that
reason is not a means of perceiving the truth but an obstacle on the way. This
thought is most clearly expressed in Zen Buddhism, where the practice of
meditation leads to a state of pure consciousness in which one sees the world
&ldquo;as it really is.&rdquo; In order to get closer to this state, students are expected to
work on kōans which, from the point of view of a Western understanding,
are unanswerable questions or meaningless statements. Working with them
helps one to transcend reason, which is seen as an obstacle on the way to an
enlightened state of being. The idea of enlightenment in Buddhism differs
from the use of the word in the West, where it refers to the independent use
of reason to gain insight into the true nature of this world.
</p>
<p>The first ✍dogmatic principles of a theory closely resemble what Thomas Kuhn
called a paradigm. Paradigms are sets of practices that define a scientific discipline
at any particular period of time. Paradigms come in at different levels of abstraction.
The most general level of abstraction within the Western paradigm of Enlighten-
ment is the belief that the independent use of reason allows one to gain insight into
the true nature of this world (see the above digression). Neoclassical economics,
for example, has the ideas of rational choice and methodological individualism as
important parts of its paradigm.
</p>
<p>1.2.2 Theories andModels
</p>
<p>In mainstream economics, at least, theories have models ✍as their &ldquo;logical back-
bones.&rdquo; A model is a collection of assumptions and hypotheses that are linked by
the rules of logic and mathematics. A model makes several assumptions about an
aspect of reality and derives hypotheses from these assumptions in a logically con-
sistent way. To understand the difference between theories and models, look at the
following example.
</p>
<p>Assume one wants to develop a theory about the functioning of the price mech-
anism on markets. In order to do so, one thinks about, for example, the way</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>individuals sell and buy their stuff and how these buying and selling decisions ex-
plain the formation of prices. This structured way of thinking is one of the models
underlying one&rsquo;s theory.
</p>
<p>The crucial function of a model, in the context of theory-formation, is to make
sure that the key causal mechanisms underlying a theory are made explicit and
logically consistent. Look at the following model to understand why:
</p>
<p>Model 1
</p>
<p>Assumption 1: All human beings are in the streets.
Assumption 2: Peter is a human being.
Hypothesis: Peter is sitting at my home.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Model 1&rdquo; is a model because it has a set of assumptions and a hypothesis,✍ but the
hypothesis does not follow logically from the assumptions. In this case, the model
is logically inconsistent, even though the hypothesis might be correct empirically
(Peter is sitting right next to me). The point is that the assumptions cannot explain
my observation, which makes the model useless for any theory. A consistent model
is therefore a necessary condition for a good theory.
</p>
<p>However, is it also sufficient? Here is an example of a very simple model:
</p>
<p>Model 2
</p>
<p>Assumption 1: All the dead are looking over one&rsquo;s shoulder.
Assumption 2: Karl Marx is dead.
Hypothesis: Karl Marx is looking over one&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>The above set of assumptions and hypotheses fulfills all the requirements of a
good model. All the assumptions are spelled out explicitly and the hypothesis fol-
lows from the assumptions in a logically consistent way. Would the model be a good
ingredient of a theory of the dead? It is difficult to imagine that it would get the ap-
proval of many experts. Logical consistency is therefore of obvious importance for
scientific reasoning, but it is not enough. In order to evaluate the &ldquo;soundness&rdquo; of a
theory, one needs additional, &ldquo;softer&rdquo; criteria like adequacy, simplicity or plausibil-
ity.
</p>
<p>1.2.3 The Virtue of Thriftiness
</p>
<p>An important criterion for good models is simplicity, frugality or thriftiness. The
idea is often referred to as Ockham&rsquo;s razor (named for an English Franciscan Friar
in the 14th century), which states that, among competing models, the one with
the fewest assumptions should be selected. However, this concept is much older.
Aristotle (2004), in his Posterior Analytics, stated that, &ldquo;we may assume the supe-
riority ceteris paribus [all things being equal] of the demonstration which derives
from fewer postulates or hypotheses.&rdquo; Ockham&rsquo;s razor is widely accepted among</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Some Methodological Remarks 15
</p>
<p>economists. Robert Solow (1997, p. 43) summarizes the self-image of the profes-
sion in a very concise way: &ldquo;Today, if you ask a mainstream economist a question
about almost any aspect of economic life, the response will be: suppose we model
that situation and see what happens. [. . . ] A model is a deliberately simplified
representation of a much more complicated situation. [. . . ] The idea is to focus
on one or two causal or conditioning factors, exclude everything else, and hope to
understand how just these aspects of reality work and interact.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Ockham&rsquo;s razor necessarily implies that the assumptions of a model should not
be realistic in the na&iuml;ve sense that the assumptions shall fit reality. Scientific theory-
building necessarily reduces complexity to make a situation comprehensible for
the human mind. Joan Robinson (1962) found a nice expression for the problems
implied by models built on &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; assumptions: &ldquo;[a] model which took account
of all the variegation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of
one to one.&rdquo; However, the epistemic problem goes even deeper, as illustrated by the
novel Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne (2003). The book is the autobiography
of the protagonist, which is so detailed that it takes the author one year to write
down a single day of his life. From this perspective, the map is even more detailed
than the territory and the level of detail one considers adequate must be based on a
subjective value-judgment.
</p>
<p>Maps have to simplify in order to be useful. On the other hand, is there a &ldquo;right&rdquo;
way to simplify? The answer to this question must also be &ldquo;no,&rdquo; because it depends
on what one wants to do with the map. If one is driving a car, contour lines are not
essential and may easily distract attention from other, more important information.
However, if one is planning to hike in the mountains, contour lines are crucial.
Therefore, a good simplification depends on its purpose.
</p>
<p>1.2.4 Do AssumptionsMatter?
</p>
<p>If assumptions shall not be realistic, then maybe one can conclude that assumptions
do not matter at all. This position has, in fact, been put forward by Milton Friedman
(1953, p. 14), one of the most influential economists of his time. He proposed that
&ldquo;Truly important and significant hypotheses will be found to have &lsquo;assumptions&rsquo;
that are wildly inaccurate descriptive representations of reality, and, in general, the
more significant the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions (in this sense).&rdquo;
</p>
<p>There is some debate as to whether Friedman adheres to the extreme position that
assumptions do not matter at all (called instrumentalism) or not but, for the sake of
argument, consider this position and see where it leads. According to an instrumen-
talist&rsquo;s view, one should judge a theory according to the validity and usefulness of
the hypotheses, whereas the assumptions are irrelevant. Does this position make
sense? Look at the following model.
</p>
<p>Model 3
</p>
<p>Assumption: Seatbelts reduce the likelihood of fatal accidents.
Hypothesis: Seatbelts reduce the likelihood of fatal accidents.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>Model 3 looks like a pretty nonsensical waste of time and is an example of a cir-
cular argument, but why does one find it intuitively unconvincing? The hypothesis
can be empirically tested and it has been confirmed by the data. Therefore, accord-
ing to an instrumentalist&rsquo;s view, a theory that is built on this model passes the test of
usefulness. The idea that assumptions are completely irrelevant is, of course, flawed
because it prevents one from learning anything about the causal mechanisms that
drive the hypotheses, if one cannot rule out the trivial model where hypotheses and
assumptions coincide. Even if one&rsquo;s mind can never grasp the true causal mecha-
nism, and thus one has to be satisfied with crude narratives and heuristics, declaring
the assumptions irrelevant leaves one with only cookbooks.
</p>
<p>Instrumentalism is an extreme position and there are reasons to assume that
Friedman&rsquo;s own position is more balanced. He argues that the role of a posi-
tive science &ldquo;is the development of a &lsquo;theory&rsquo; or &lsquo;hypothesis&rsquo; that yields valid and
meaningful (i.e. not truistic) predictions about phenomena not yet observed.&rdquo; It can
be argued that the term &ldquo;truistic&rdquo; refers to models of the above type that are only
uninteresting tautologies. In the end, scientific theory-building has a subjective
component, because the balance between, on the one hand, meaningful simplifica-
tions of the assumptions and of the supposed causal mechanisms and, on the other
hand, the explanatory power of the hypotheses cannot be precisely nailed down. It
is the art and craft of experienced scientists to see if a theory is &ldquo;in balance&rdquo; in this
sense.
</p>
<p>1.2.5 An Example
</p>
<p>To illustrate✍ the role assumptions play in models, I will introduce the concept of the
production-possibility frontier that will reappear in Chap. 2. In a modern, complex
economy, there are millions of people, who all go to work, consume goods, enjoy
their friends and families, and so on. This maze of interactions would be impossi-
ble to analyze without simplifying assumptions that make it comprehensible to the
scientist&rsquo;s mind. One question, which is relevant to economists, is about the trade-
offs the economy faces when it produces goods and services. Goods and services
are produced by all kinds of resources, using tools and skills. The production-
possibility frontier abstracts from all these complexities. In the simplest case, one
makes the assumption that the economy can produce exactly two goods, 1 and 2,
whose quantities are drawn along the axes of Fig. 1.1.
</p>
<p>The quantity of good 1 is drawn along the abscissa (horizontal axis) and the
quantity of good 2 along the ordinate (vertical axis). The downward-sloping graph
in the figure is the production-possibility frontier for goods 1 and 2. The graph
shows the various combinations of the two goods that can be produced in the econ-
omy, in a given period of time. This illustration of production possibilities relies
on drastically simplifying assumptions, but it has two great advantages: it is easy
to grasp and it allows for analyzing some of the basic trade-offs a society faces.
The graph must be downward-sloping, because scarcity implies that an increase in
the production of one good must have opportunity costs: an increase in the produc-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Some Methodological Remarks 17
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 An example for a
production-possibility fron-
tier
</p>
<p>x2
</p>
<p>x1
</p>
<p>tion of one necessitates a reduction in the production of the other good. The slope
of the function is a measure of the opportunity costs, because it measures by how
much the production of one good must be reduced, if one produces an additional
(small) unit of the other good. It remains to be shown how useful this tool actually
is. The purpose of this simple model is to illustrate what the role of simplifying
assumptions means.
</p>
<p>1.2.6 Critical Rationalism
</p>
<p>The workhorse epistemology in economics is Critical Rationalism, ✍which has been
advocated by Karl Popper, among others. According to this view, scientific the-
ories can never be verified (for reasons that have been discussed before) but can,
in principle, be falsified by bringing in empirical evidence that is in conflict with
the hypotheses of the theory. Hence, theories should be formulated such that their
hypotheses are falsifiable, which means that it has to be possible to give empirically
accessible conditions under which the theory is considered incompatible with ob-
servations. Good theories are those that have a large empirical content, but have not
been falsified so far. In addition, Ockham&rsquo;s razor is also an integral part of Critical
Rationalism.
</p>
<p>Critical Rationalism leads to a back-and-forth between theoretical and empirical
reasoning: the (empirically) falsifiable hypotheses of models must be empirically
tested. These tests can either falsify the theory or not. Non-falsified theories are
preliminarily accepted, if no other non-falsified theory exists that explains more
cases with less restrictive assumptions. If the theory is falsified, the insights from
the process of falsification can be used to modify the models.
</p>
<p>A weak spot of Critical Rationalism is its unscrutinized belief in empirical fal-
sification. The problem is that one does not have direct proof of facts; that any</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>empirical observation relies on a theory, as well. A lot of statistical data, for ex-
ample, is collected within a highly complex system of national accounting and
data generated in lab experiments depends on the interpretation of the experiment.
Therefore, from an epistemic point of view, falsification is no more or less than the
proof of the logical inconsistency of two different theories: a theoretical theory and
an empirical theory. Which one will be refuted relies, again, on value judgments or
on experts&rsquo; &ldquo;gut feelings.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>This problem is an example of the much more profound problem known as un-
derdeterminacy of scientific theory or the Duhem-Quine problem. According to
Quine (1951), &ldquo;[t]he totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs, from the most
casual matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of atomic physics
or even of pure mathematics and logic, is a man-made fabric which impinges on
experience only along the edges. Or, to change the figure, total science is like a
field of force whose boundary conditions are experience. A conflict with experi-
ence at the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field. But the
total field is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions, experience, that there
is much latitude of choice as to what statements to reevaluate in the light of any
single contrary experience. No particular experiences are linked with any particular
statements in the interior of the field, except indirectly through considerations of
equilibrium affecting the field as a whole.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Some philosophers of science, like Imre Lakatos (1976), draw the conclusion
that underdetermination makes scientific &ldquo;progress&rdquo; largely a function of the scien-
tist&rsquo;s talent, creativity, resolve and resources. Even more radical work, by Thomas
Kuhn (1962), suggests that ultimately the social and political interests determine
the conclusions one draws from the inconsistencies within or between theories. In
order to take this sting out of the program of scientific reasoning, one must con-
clude that the best one can hope for is to create a level playing field for scientific
debate, where the success of an argument is not influenced by money or power, and
a consensus among experts is reached by a &ldquo;non-hierarchical discourse&rdquo; (J&uuml;rgen
Habermas (1983)).
</p>
<p>1.2.7 Positive and Normative Theories
</p>
<p>Theories come✍ in two flavors: positive theories are used to explain a phenomenon.
With the exception of the underlying &ldquo;dogmatic&rdquo; first principles, they contain no
value judgments. They generate insights into the causal mechanisms linking causes
and effects. Positive economics, therefore, tries to explain how people deal with the
phenomenon of scarcity. Statements about &ldquo;what is&rdquo; are also called descriptive.
</p>
<p>Normative theories✍ , on the other hand, make prescriptions about what people
should do under certain circumstances. They, therefore, rely on a value judgment.
Statements like &ldquo;you should lose some weight&rdquo; or &ldquo;Switzerland should reduce its
corporate income-tax rate&rdquo; are normative statements. Whether one considers them
relevant or not depends on two things. First, one has to share the basic norma-
tive principles underlying the advice (&ldquo;living longer is better than living shorter&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;Switzerland should maximize its national income&rdquo;). Second, one has to agree with</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Some Methodological Remarks 19
</p>
<p>the positive theories bridging normative principles and normative advice (&ldquo;over-
weight people live, on average, shorter than lean people because they have a higher
risk of cardiovascular diseases&rdquo;, or &ldquo;lower corporate-income tax rates attract capital
investments, which increase national income&rdquo;). Amartya Sen (1970) calls the first
class of value judgments basic and the second nonbasic. Basic value judgments
only depend on first ethical principles, whereas nonbasic value judgments are an
amalgam of first principles and positive theories.
</p>
<p>The distinction between basic and nonbasic value judgments is important for
political debates, because it is possible to debate about positive statements. The
claim that lower tax rates increase investments which, in turn, increase national in-
come, can be empirically tested, so people can, in principle, settle disputes about
positive statements (in the sense of consensus among experts in a non-hierarchical
discourse). The mainstream view, however, claims that this is not the case for basic
value judgments. According to David Hume, there is a qualitative difference be-
tween descriptive and prescriptive statements. Prescriptive statements, according to
this widely accepted view, are not facts of life that can be discovered by scientific
reasoning. Here is the famous passage where Hume (1739) makes his point: &ldquo;In ev-
ery system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that
the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary ways of reasoning, and establishes
the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when all of a
sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions,
is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an
ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the last consequence.
For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, &lsquo;tis nec-
essary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason
should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can
be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do
not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers;
and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of
morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely
on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Likewise, George Edward Moore (1903) coined the term naturalistic fallacy for
the category error someone commits when he defines the &ldquo;good&rdquo; (in the sense of
intrinsically valuable) by certain properties of things. It could, for example, be
that pleasant things are &ldquo;good&rdquo; things, and that pleasure should therefore be the
basis for one&rsquo;s value judgments (a position called hedonism). Others may argue
that meaningful things are &ldquo;good&rdquo; things, and society should therefore provide the
necessary means to promote meaningfulness. The point of the naturalistic fallacy, as
Moore describes it, is that, even if one agrees to a certain position, one cannot define
the idea of goodness with reference to these properties, because it is no natural
property. It is &ldquo;one of those innumerable objects of thought which are themselves
incapable of definition, because they are the ultimate terms by reference to which
whatever is capable of definition must be defined.&rdquo; (Principia Ethica, &sect;10)
</p>
<p>Scientific reasoning cannot prove the goodness of things or acts; goodness can
only reveal itself in, for example, a moment of bliss or awe. The fact that ethical
insights lie beyond scientific reasoning is also clearly expressed by Wittgenstein</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>(1998) in that &ldquo;there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express
anything higher. [. . . ] It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcen-
dental. [. . . ] There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make
themselves manifest.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The fact-value dichotomy has not remained undisputed, however. As shown,
dogmatism is the only practical solution to the M&uuml;nchhausen Trilemma. However,
dogmatism implies that the distinction between facts and values is not as clear as
was envisioned by Hume. Apparently, value-free facts are tainted by value judge-
ments about first principles (Hilary Putnam 2002). The opposite point of view is
the position that ethical sentences express propositions, which refer to objective
features of the world. It is called moral realism.
</p>
<p>The fact-value dichotomy is widely accepted by economists, which has impor-
tant consequences for economics as a social science, because it constrains the role of
the economist to that of an expert (hopefully) in descriptive statements. Economists
can clarify the effects of changes in the tax system, monetary policies, or labor mar-
ket policies like minimum wages, to name only a few. However, the economist is
no expert in the basic normative question, of what the members of society should
want. The division of labor between economists and the general public is, accord-
ing to this view, that the general public articulates what it wants (in terms of first
principles) and that the economist uses her toolbox to figure what to do.
</p>
<p>This restricted role of economists sounds pleasantly humble and innocuous but,
in fact, it is not necessarily so. First of all, and at a very profound level, even posi-
tive theories have a normative core that defines the acceptable practices (remember
the problem of dogmatism discussed before). However, from a more practical point
of view, the division of labor outlined above does not exist in practice. Usually, av-
erage people &ndash; and even politicians &ndash; have very opaque and conflicting ideas about
their normative principles. As a result, they mix conflicting emotions and narratives
into an amalgam of ideas that Sen (1970) has called nonbasic value judgments. Eco-
nomic advisors have to somehow fill the resulting gaps, which necessarily grants
them authority in normative matters that they should not have. There is not much
that one can do about that, but an awareness of this fact can be very helpful. In
addition, it should be a unanimously accepted principle of scientific hygiene that
economists, who are asked for advice in a situation of unclear normative principles,
disclose and actively communicate the normative premises of their work. Other-
wise, one crosses the border from scientist to ideologist.
</p>
<p>1.2.8 Schools of Economic Thought
</p>
<p>The majority of the theories discussed in this book stem from two different schools
of thought: neoclassical economics and new institutional economics. Despite the
fact that neoclassical economics is the mainstream school of thought and taught at
most universities around the world, the underlying paradigm is far from uncontro-
versial. The purpose of this subchapter is, therefore, to give a short overview over</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Some Methodological Remarks 21
</p>
<p>these, as well as other schools of thought, to better understand the paradigms and to
put them into perspective.
</p>
<p>Neoclassical economics ✍is not a monolithic theory with undisputed first princi-
ples. Despite its heterogeneity and versatility, some underlying unifying principles
can be identified: (1) methodological and normative individualism, (2) consequen-
tialism (and, more specifically, welfarism, an ethical theory that we will discuss in
Chap. 5), (3) rational or rationality-seeking agents, and (4) society as a network of
mutual transactions that follow the logic of opportunity costs. These basal axioms
are enriched by other, more specific assumptions. Neoclassical economics is es-
pecially dominant in microeconomics, but it also developed into macroeconomics
where, together with Keynesian economics, it forms the so-called neoclassical syn-
thesis. Keynesianism was initially a fundamental critique of some of the implica-
tions of neoclassical thinking (like the neutrality of money) but was later integrated
into the neoclassical theory (at the price of changing Keynes&rsquo; initial theory beyond
recognition, as some Keynesians would stress).
</p>
<p>As the name suggests, neoclassical economics emerged from classical eco-
nomics, which is also called political economy. The main differences between
classical and neoclassical economics represented a shift in attention regarding the
most relevant economic problems and in the underlying theory of value.
</p>
<p>Classical economics originated at a time when capitalism was gradually re-
placing feudalism and innovations were fueling the Industrial Revolution that was
completely changing society. One of the most pressing problems, in such a period
of change, was how society could be organized, if every individual seeks his or her
own advantage. This is why the idea that free markets have the ability to regulate
themselves was of such profound importance, because it expressed the belief that
a decentralized society, built on the principles of self-interest, can work. Important
proponents of this school of thought were Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, David
Ricardo, Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill.
</p>
<p>In addition, the classical economists had a focus on economic growth and pro-
duction. This is why they shared the view that the economic value of a product
depends on the costs involved in producing that product. This theory of value is one
of the key differences between classical and neoclassical thinking, which replaced
this comparatively more objective standard of value with a subjective one that is
based on utility. The idea is that economic value does not stem from any objective
property of a good (like the amount of labor that went into its production), but from
the importance the good has for the achievement of the individuals&rsquo; goals.
</p>
<p>A second distinctive feature of early neoclassical thinking is what is sometimes
called the &ldquo;marginalist revolution&rdquo; in economics. When individuals make decisions,
they think in terms of trade-offs and they think &ldquo;at the margin,&rdquo; which means that
they compare the satisfaction they get from an additional unit of a good with the
costs of this additional unit. Market prices then reflect these marginal exchange
rates. Thinking &ldquo;at the margin&rdquo; allowed neoclassical thinking to resolve puzzles
that resulted from objective theories of value, like the fact that water is more im-
portant than diamonds, but the price for diamonds is higher than the price for water.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22 1 First Principles
</p>
<p>While water has greater total utility, diamonds have greater marginal utility, which
is relevant for prices.
</p>
<p>The neoclassical approach started to replace classical economics in the 1870s.
Important early proponents of neoclassical economics were William Stanley Jevons,
Carl Menger, John Bates Clark, and L&eacute;on Walras. They were followed by Alfred
Marshall, Joan Robinson, John Richard Hicks, George Stigler, Kenneth Arrow, Paul
Anthony Samuelson and Milton Friedman, to name only a few.
</p>
<p>Institutional economics emphasises that economic transactions are embedded in✍
a complex network of culture, norms and institutions. The functioning of, for exam-
ple, markets, according to this view, cannot be understood in isolation, which brings
this school of thought into sharp contrast with neoclassical economics and it is con-
sidered a heterodox school of thought. However, an important variant of this school
evolved in the second half of the 20th century: new institutional economics. It has
its roots in two articles by Ronald Coase. They made it clear that transaction costs
are at the heart of an institutional analysis, which allows for the characterization of
the relative merits of markets, firms or the government in achieving the normative
goals of society. New institutional economics is critical of neoclassical economics,
because of its focus on markets and rationality, but uses and builds on elements of
this theory. Therefore, it does not contrast with, but instead complements neoclas-
sical thinking. Important figures in this field are Armen Alchian, Harold Demsetz,
Douglass North, Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson, among others.
</p>
<p>There are, of course, other schools of economic thought, and it would be be-
yond the scope of this book to do justice to them all and to show their relationships
with neoclassical and new institutional economics. Some influential schools of the
past have declined in influence, including the historical school of economics (for
example, Gustav von Schmoller, Etienne Laspeyres, Werner Sombart), Marxian
economics (for example, Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci), Austrian economics (for
example, Carl Menger, Eugen von B&ouml;hm-Bawerk, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich
von Hayek, some of whom are better classified as neoclassical economists), and in-
stitutional economics (for example, Thorstein Veblen, John R. Commons, and John
Kenneth Galbraith), and are now often considered heterodox approaches. How-
ever, there are also more recent developments like feminist economics (represented
by, for example, Marylin Waring Marianne Ferber or Joyce Jacobson) and ecolog-
ical economics (represented, for example, by Herman Edward Daly or Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen). Up until now, however, these schools mostly criticize specific
aspects of mainstream economics without developing independent schools.
</p>
<p>It is unclear how other, more recent developments, like evolutionary economics,
behavioral economics and neuroeconomics will relate to the neoclassical paradigm.
As demonstrated by the neoclassical synthesis, which integrated a specific interpre-
tation of Keynesian with neoclassical thinking, neoclassical economics proved to be
extremely versatile in the past, adapting to changes and adopting approaches that
started as a critique of the mainstream.</p>

<p>2.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a
great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we
ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own
industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage. The general industry of
the country, being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby
be diminished [. . . ] but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the
greatest advantage. (Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book IV: 2)
</p>
<p>Under a system of perfectly free commerce, each country naturally devotes its capital and
labour to such employments as are most beneficial to each. This pursuit of individual
advantage is admirably connected with the universal good of the whole. [. . . ] It is this
principle which determines that wine shall be made in France and Portugal, that corn shall
be grown in America and Poland, and that hardware and other goods shall be manufactured
in England. (David Ricardo (2004))
</p>
<p>Economics has always been an underdog among the sciences, with the aspiration
to play in the same league as the natural sciences but, at the same time, lacking
the general theories and insights that characterize, for example, modern physics.

<p>26 2 Gains from Trade
</p>
<p>This fact is nicely expressed by an exchange between Paul Samuelson, one of the
most influential economists of the 20th century and Nobel price winner, and the
mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, who once challenged Samuelson to &ldquo;name me one
proposition in all of the social sciences which is both true and non-trivial,&rdquo; obvi-
ously expecting the question to be left unanswered. Apparently it took Samuelson
several years before he found one: the theory of comparative advantage. &ldquo;That it is
logically true need not be argued before a mathematician; that it is not trivial is at-
tested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able
to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them&rdquo;
(Samuelson 1969). It should, therefore, come as no surprise that this theory is still
at the heart of economics and it is very useful for understanding how societies cope
with the problem of scarcity. Perhaps surprisingly, after all these years, the theory
of comparative advantage still gives rise to misunderstandings and ideology-tainted
controversies. It is the purpose of this chapter to illustrate the basic insight of this
theory, its implications not only for economics but also for business administration
and law, as well as the potential fallacies one is prone to when applying the theory.
</p>
<p>Ricardo developed the theory of comparative advantage to explain why it is
mutually beneficial for nation states to allow for international trade. His famous
example is trade between England and Portugal. This focus on international trade
was obvious in the political atmosphere of the days when powerful political forces
in England opposed free trade, because they feared that they could not compete with
Portugal. At the same time, it planted the seed for potential misunderstandings and
misinterpretations, as will be discussed below. This is why I approach the theory
from a different angle where individuals rather than states contemplate exchanging
goods and services.
</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect of societies, which must cope with scarcity, is that the acts
of individuals are interdependent. If person A eats a sandwich, then B cannot eat
the same sandwich; if B wears a red sweater, then A has to look at it, and so on.
This interdependency can explain the phenomenon of exchange and specialization.
The starting point of this endeavor is a situation where all individuals in a society
abstain from trading goods and services, i.e. an individual must produce everything
she consumes. This situation is called an autarky.
</p>
<p>The theory of comparative advantage is developed here by means of an intuitive
example: assume there are two individuals, Ann (A) and Bill (B), and two com-
modities, pears (P ) and tomatoes (T ). Ann and Bill are initially in a situation of
autarky.
</p>
<p>� Case 1: Each individual can produce exactly one and wants to consume only
this good. This is the trivial benchmark case when autarky is, in fact, a per-
fectly adequate way to organize economic activities. Interactions between Ann
and Bill cannot reduce scarcity because neither person has goods or services to
offer that the other person wants. The only challenge imposed by scarcity is
self-management: how should Ann and Bill organize their days such that they</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.1 Introduction 27
</p>
<p>can consume enough pears and tomatoes? If this situation were an adequate
and exhaustive description of reality, the economic journey would end before it
really got started, because there would be no need to think about how people or-
ganize interactions and develop institutions to alleviate scarcity. Human beings
would live happily from the yields of their own gardens. Fortunately for social
scientists, this is not what the world is about.
</p>
<p>� Case 2: Each individual can produce exactly one good, but wants to consume
both. This case gives a first explanation for trade between the individuals. Ann
can grow only tomatoes in her garden and Bill only pears, but they prefer to have
both for lunch and dinner. In this case, it is obvious that it makes sense for them
to establish a &ldquo;trade agreement&rdquo; that specifies how many pears and tomatoes shall
be exchanged between A and B . If this scenario were to adequately describe the
world, one should observe trade.
</p>
<p>� Case 3: Each individual ✍can produce and wants to consume both goods. How-
ever, one individual is better at producing tomatoes (Ann) and the other at pro-
ducing pears (Bill). In this situation, each individual has an absolute advantage
in the production of exactly one good. (One can interpret case 2 as a special
case of case 3 where the absolute advantage of each individual is pushed to its
extreme.) In this situation, Ann and Bill do not necessarily rely on each other,
if they want to have tomatoes together with pears for lunch, but cooperation can
make life easier. With absolute advantages in the production of goods, it makes
sense if individuals specialize and trade. The total number of pears and toma-
toes that is available, if Ann specializes in the production of tomatoes and Bill
in the production of pears, increases. However, specialization and trade are two
sides of the same coin. Assume that the production of pears and tomatoes in an
autarky reflects Ann&rsquo;s and Bill&rsquo;s &ldquo;taste&rdquo; for both goods (economists call these
tastes the individuals&rsquo; preferences) such that they are the most preferred bundles
they can produce, given their production possibilities. Deviating from this pro-
duction plan and specializing, according to the absolute advantage, makes them
worse off without trade. Given that specialization increases total production, it
is always possible to guarantee both individuals their autarky consumption and
still leave a surplus.
</p>
<p>� Case 4: Each individual can produce both goods and wants to consume both.
One individual is better at producing both goods, tomatoes and pears. This is the
critical case, which required Ricardo&rsquo;s ingenuity to understand that both, Ann
and Bill, can be better off by specialization and trade. The intuition as to why this
is the case is built around the idea of scarcity itself. Assume A has an absolute
advantage in the production of pears and tomatoes. With unlimited resources,
she could easily outperform B . However, resources are not unlimited. Assume
that both individuals spend all of their work time producing either P or T . In
this case, the only way for A to produce more T is by reducing the production
of P , because she has to devote more of her scarce time to the production of T ,
which leaves less for P . Assume that the rate of transformation is 2 to 1, i.e. a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28 2 Gains from Trade
</p>
<p>reduction of one unit of P increases the production of T by two units. Given that
her autarky production was optimal for her needs, such a change is not advisable.
At this✍ point, B can make his appearance. Assume that A and B team up and
arrange that B compensates the loss of P by producing less T . Remember that
his rate of transformation is 1 to 1. To compensate for the increase of P by one
unit, he therefore has to reduce the production of T by one unit. However, if
one does the math, one can see how the apparent magic of comparative advance
works: the change in the total quantity of pears is �1 (by A) C1 (by B) D 0, so
the total amount of pears remains unchanged. How about tomatoes? The change
in total the quantity of tomatoes is C2 (by A) �1 (by B) D C1: total production
goes up, because Bill has a comparative advantage in the production of pears.
Even though Ann is twice, or even a hundred times, more productive than Bill in
absolute terms, she is still subject to resource (time) constraints. Hence, as long
as Ann and Bill differ in their rates of transformation of the two goods at the
point where the resource (time) constraints become binding (their opportunity
costs), there is room for mutually beneficial specialization and trade.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the point, compare Jonathan Ive, the chef designer of Apple Inc., with me.
I am doing OK as an economics teacher, but I am a pretty bad designer. Jonathan
Ive is a brilliant designer and, I assume, he would also be a very good economics
teacher. Thus, he is better than me in both respects: he has an absolute advantage in
designing computers and in teaching economics. I can sympathize with the position
that a student would like to be educated by a very good teacher, not only a decent
one, but does it make sense from an overarching perspective? If Jonathan Ive were
to teach economics, he would not be able to use the time to develop new designs
for the next generation of whatever kind of gadget is in Apple&rsquo;s pipeline. Thus, one
basically has the choice between two alternatives: learning economics from the
best teacher available, but using computers that are, well, interestingly designed, or
learning economics from an OK teacher but with well-designed computers. Alter-
natively, consider another perspective. It is very likely that I would be unemployed
as a designer. If I replace Jonathan Ive as an economics teacher, then I am better
off, because I make at least some money. He would, however, be profoundly better
off because, despite the fact that he loses the money he would make as professor,
he makes much more money as Apple Inc.&rsquo;s head of the design group.
</p>
<p>Looking at it from this perspective, the theory of comparative advantage is very
comforting for people like me: you think that you are nothing special? Do not
worry, even if there are people out there who outperform you in every possible
aspect of life, they have only a limited amount of time. That is your chance.
</p>
<p>2.2 An Example
</p>
<p>The next step is to develop a more precise understanding of the theory of compara-
tive advantage by specifying the production possibilities of Ann and Bill. Assume
that both have a total of 100 hours that they can spend on the production of either</p>

the implied maximum production levels. The table shows that A is, in fact, more
productive than B : she needs half the time to produce a kilo of tomatoes and one
quarter of the time to produce a kilo of pears. Assume that A and B can divide their
time freely between the production of both goods and that productivities are con-
stant. With this assumption, one can analyze the example by means of the concept
of the production-possibility frontier that was introduced in Chap. 1.

<p>The total production of pears (in kilos) is drawn along the abscissa and the total pro-
duction of tomatoes (in kilos) is drawn along the ordinate. The absolute advantage
of A in the production of both goods is reflected in the fact that her production-
possibility frontier lies to the north-east of B&rsquo;s. Note, however, that the slopes of
both frontiers differ, which will be crucial for the identification of a comparative
advantage.
</p>
<p>In order to get there, one starts with the determination of the opportunity costs
of production (OC). The opportunity cost of an additional kilo of, for example,
tomatoes is the reduction in the production of pears, which is necessary due to
the reallocation of time from pear to tomato production. It is equal to the slope
of the production-possibility frontier (in absolute terms). Alternatively, one can
determine the opportunity cost of pears in terms of tomatoes, which is equal to the
inverse slope of the production-possibility frontier (in absolute terms). Table 2.2
summarizes these costs.
</p>
<p>A comparison of the opportunity costs allows one to identify the comparative
advantage of Ann and Bill. Figure 2.2 shows the increase in the production of

</p>
<p>tomatoes, if Ann and Bill are willing to reduce the production of pears by one kilo.
It is one kilo for Ann and half a kilo for Bill. This observation shows that it is
relatively easier for Bill to increase the production of tomatoes: an additional kilo
costs him half a kilo of pears, whereas Ann would have to reduce the production by
one kilo. Hence, Bill has a comparative advantage in the production of tomatoes.
</p>
<p>The concept of comparative advantage is relational, because the fact that Bill
has a comparative advantage in the production of tomatoes necessarily implies that
Ann has a comparative advantage in the production of pears: if she reduces the
production of tomatoes by one kilo, she gets an additional kilo of pears, whereas
Bill only gets 500 grams.
</p>
<p>After identifying the comparative advantages of Ann and Bill, one can set up
an example that illustrates how specialization, according to comparative advantage,
can increase total production. In order to do so, assume that both individuals want to
consume pears and tomatoes in equal quantities. The 45ı-line in Fig. 2.3 denotes the
set of most preferred combinations of pears and tomatoes (consumption bundles).
</p>
<p>The consumption levels in autarky are given at the intersections of the 45ı-line
and the production-possibility frontiers. Analytically, they are the solution to the
two systems of equations xAT D 100 � xAP ^ xAT D xAP , and xBT D 50 � 2 � xBP ^
xBT D xBP . The solutions are xAT D xAP D 50 and xBT D xBP D 50=3. The
important question is if both Ann and Bill can be made better off, if they specialize
according to their comparative advantages and exchange goods. Table 2.3 shows</p>

</p>
<p>how individual and total production changes, if A produces more pears and B more
tomatoes. As predicted by the theory of comparative advantage, specialization can
increase the total production of both tomatoes and pears. It is completely irrelevant
that B is less productive than A in everything he can do. The only thing that matters
is that they differ in their opportunity costs.
</p>
<p>The increase✍ in production is called the material gains from trade, which one
distinguishes from the subjective gains from trade or, simply, gains from trade.
What is the difference? The material gains from trade measure the increase in total
production. The production of material goods is, however, only a means and not the
end of economic activities. What ultimately counts is what material goods can do
for people, how they contribute to their well-being, and the term &lsquo;gains from trade&rsquo;
refers to a measure of this increase in subjective well-being.
</p>
<p>At this point, one has to ask two different questions.
</p>
<p>� First, it is important to understand how comprehensive the result is. Is it an
artifact of the above model or does it hold under general conditions?
</p>
<p>� Second, if it is a general result, then one has to ask what it implies for an econ-
omy. Are gains from trade exploited automatically or must societies organize
economic activity in a specific way to ensure that the potential gains from trade
will in fact be exploited?
</p>
<p>The next two subchapters are dedicated to the discussion of these two topics.
</p>
<p>2.3 How General is the Theory of Comparative Advantage?
</p>
<p>A peculiar feature of the above model is the linearity of the production-possibility
frontier. In this case, comparative advantage is a well-defined global concept and
the results are completely general: with the exception of the limiting case of equal
opportunity costs, there is always a way to increase production by specialization.
There may, however, also be cases where production possibilities are more accu-
rately described by a strictly concave (outward-bending) frontier. In this case, com-
parative advantage is no longer a global, but rather a local concept and it depends on
the autarky points along the production-possibility frontier. Production-possibility
frontiers are concave, if productivity is decreasing in production. Figure 2.4 illus-
trates such a situation and the possibility for the reversal of comparative advantages.
</p>
<p>Points X and Y represent two possible autarky situations. The slopes of the
frontiers are a measure for local opportunity costs. As one can see, A has a com-
parative advantage in the production of T in X and a comparative advantage in the</p>

<p>production of P in Y . Beyond that, however, there is no difference from the model
with constant opportunity costs: if opportunity costs in autarky differ, there is room
for mutual improvement by specialization and trade.
</p>
<p>If the frontier can be concave, it could also be convex (inward-bending).
Production-possibility frontiers are convex, if productivity is increasing in pro-
duction. Figure 2.5 illustrates this case.
</p>
<p>Assume that one starts in a situation of autarky X , where neither A nor B have
a local comparative advantage. Even in this case, it makes sense to specialize and
trade, because specialization allows them to increase productivity. In this case,
specialization creates a comparative advantage that was nonexistent in autarky. This
is shown with point Y in Fig. 2.5 in which it is assumed that A and B completely
specialize.
</p>
<p>The theory ✍of comparative advantage, therefore, seems to be robust with respect
to the laws governing production. In this sense it is, in fact, completely general. If
this were the end of the story, however, there should be no resentment towards the
process of globalization, which seems to be shared by many people. It can often
be read that globalization does not only create winners but also losers and that it is,
therefore, a lie to claim that everyone is better off. If, in the words of Adam Smith,
&ldquo;the extent of this division [of labor] must always be limited by the extent [. . . ] of
the market,&rdquo; and if division of labor is a good thing, the process of global market
integration must be a good thing, as well. The only explanation as to why skeptics
are skeptics is that they do not get it.</p>

</p>
<p>However, this may not be the case. I claimed, at the beginning of this chapter,
that there is an important difference in whether the theory of comparative advantage
is applied to individuals or states and that one of the reasons for the confusion can be
traced back to Ricardo&rsquo;s decision to apply it to the England-Portugal case. However,
what is the difference?
</p>
<p>The key to finding an answer to this question is the realization that the sequence
of market integration may matter, and this phenomenon cannot be understood in a
two-person example. To illustrate this, I will, therefore, add Charles (C ) to the pic-
ture and assume that he can produce tomatoes and pears, as well. One distinguishes
between two scenarios.
</p>
<p>1. Simultaneous integration In this scenario, assume that all the individuals start
negotiating about specialization and trade simultaneously, starting from autarky.
In this case, the theory of comparative advantage readily applies in the modified
situation: A, B , and C will specialize according to their comparative advantages,
and the surplus of production can be distributed in a way that makes at least one
individual better off, without making any other individual worse off, since each
individual can at least ensure himself the autarky level of consumption. Therefore,
with simultaneous integration, the benchmark is autarky consumption and, given
this benchmark, there can be no loser from integration.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.3 How General is the Theory of Comparative Advantage? 35
</p>
<p>2. Sequential integration In this scenario, assume that A and B have already ne-
gotiated a trade agreement when C enters the picture. Thus, the benchmark for
comparisons for A and B is no longer the autarky consumption, but the consump-
tion with &lsquo;partial&rsquo; integration. Compared to this situation, including C into the trade
agreement need no longer be mutually beneficial. It could, for example, be that the
availability of C as a potential trading partner for A motivates A to drop B as a
trading partner and to replace him with C . In this case, B falls back to autarky,
which worsens his position. This is, in a nutshell, exactly the situation a lot of man-
ufacturing industries in Europe were facing when China entered the world markets.
Its rise as the &ldquo;workbench of the world&rdquo; induced deep structural changes in Europe,
which lost the better part of its manufacturing jobs to China. The crucial fact one
has to understand, in order to square this fact with the theory of comparative advan-
tage, is that the theory can be correct and yet, at the same time, market integration
creates losers. It is a problem of the adequate benchmark that is used for welfare
comparisons.
</p>
<p>The fact that a process of sequential integration can create losers on the way to
a fully globalized world economy also gives a hint as to why Ricardo&rsquo;s example
is potentially misleading. Ricardo&rsquo;s original example had cloth and wine as goods
and England and Portugal as countries, with Portugal having an absolute advantage
in the production of both. Market integration between countries is a special form
of sequential integration in the above sense: the starting point is not autarky, but
a situation where the English and the Portuguese have partially integrated markets.
Starting from this benchmark, any further integration of markets can produce losers.
</p>
<p>The decisive difference between Portugal and Ann and England and Bill is that
countries are no unitary actors. Saying that &ldquo;England&rdquo; can profit from trading with
&ldquo;Portugal&rdquo; is not the same as saying that Bill can profit from trading with Ann. If,
in the process of specialization, the necessary restructuring of the two economies
leads to a loss of jobs in the winemaking industry in England, it is hardly comforting
for the now unemployed to learn that the total size of the cake for the English has
increased. On the contrary, knowing that the total size of the cake is larger, but one&rsquo;s
own piece is smaller, may even foster social tensions. The restructuring processes in
the economies create winners and losers and, even if the winners could, in principle,
compensate the losers because goods become more abundant, this is rarely done in
practice. The problem does not exist in the Ann and Bill example because it is
a single individual that has to reorganize her or his day. Treating countries like
individuals blurs the underlying distributional conflicts that necessarily exist when
new players enter a market. Forcing one to think all the way back to the level of the
individual is one of the strengths of methodological individualism.
</p>
<p>There are two additional aspects of the theory of comparative advantage that
should, at least briefly, be discussed: the vulnerability towards exploitation and the
phenomenon of alienation.
</p>
<p>� Exploitation: An economy Lthat opens up for international trade will undergo re-
structurings when the industries adapt, according to the comparative advantages
of the economy, which is usually not in the short-run interests of the workforce</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36 2 Gains from Trade
</p>
<p>of the declining industries. An often-heard argument in the preceding political
debates is that relinquishing autarky makes a country more vulnerable, because
of the increasing dependence on exports and imports. Switzerland, for exam-
ple, sees the security of vital goods like food as sufficiently important to give it
the rank of constitutional law. Article 102 of the federal constitution specifies
two principles. &ldquo;(1) The Federation ensures the supply of the country with vital
goods and services for the case of power-politics or martial threats, or of severe
shortages which the economy cannot counteract by itself. It takes precautionary
measures. (2) The Federation may, if necessary, deviate from the principle of
economic freedom.&rdquo; By and large, agriculture is not a sector where Switzerland
has a comparative advantage by international standards, which implies a ten-
sion between economic freedom, market integration, and food security. These
enacted policies to protect domestic agriculture lead to higher domestic food
prices and subsidies of the agrarian sector.
It is not easy to understand whether ensuring food security in times of political
crises is a welcome narrative for the farmers to support protectionism or not.
What can be said, however, is that vulnerability due to specialization cuts both
ways, because different economies become more dependent on each other. In
order to get the right perspective on the problem, one therefore has to distinguish
between two scenarios. The first can be called the ceteris paribus scenario: if a
crisis occurs, it is important that one does not have to give in to the unjustified
demands of an aggressor. Food security is, potentially, a way to achieve this
goal. The second can be called the General equilibrium scenario, which tries to
understand the effect of specialization on the likelihood of political crises. Here,
the basic idea is that mutual interdependencies make crises less likely, because
international interdependencies also increase the risks for potential aggressors.
However, there are✍ conditions under which countries are vulnerable towards
exploitation. Such a scenario exists, if a relatively small country is highly de-
pendent on a relatively large, powerful country, and the restructuring of the
local economy is not easily reversible. Economists have coined the term hold-up
problem for a situation where specialization creates power asymmetries that can
be exploited by the relatively more powerful partner. It is, ultimately, an em-
pirical question whether the pacifying effects of specialization or the potential
exploitability dominate in a specific context.
</p>
<p>Digression 5. &ldquo;Tamingˆ the Passions:&rdquo; How Early Theorists of Capitalism Looked
at Trade and Competition
</p>
<p>Early theorists of capitalism, like Montesquieu, James Steuart and Adam
Smith, had a complex understanding of the interplay between individuals and
society. Albert Hirschmann (1977), for example, pointed out that it was a
widely shared conjecture among these philosophers that a major merit of an
economic system, based on specialization and trade, is its ability to &ldquo;tame&rdquo;
the passions of men: &ldquo;Money making [was seen] as an &lsquo;innocent&rsquo; pastime and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.3 How General is the Theory of Comparative Advantage? 37
</p>
<p>outlet for men&rsquo;s energies, as an institution that diverts men from the antago-
nistic competition for power to the somewhat ridiculous and distasteful, but
essentially harmless accumulation of wealth.&rdquo; This view on markets (as insti-
tutions) is fundamentally different from the later view, held by 20th century
mainstream economics, which has almost exclusively focused on the ability
of competitive markets to achieve efficiency. It was reanimated in the 20th
century by John Maynard Keynes (1936, p. 374), who argued that &ldquo;[. . . ]
dangerous human proclivities can be canalized into comparatively harmless
channels by the existence of opportunities for money-making and private
wealth, which, if they cannot be satisfied in this way, may find their outlet
in cruelty, the reckless pursuit of personal power and authority, and other
forms of self-aggrandisement. It is better that a man should tyrannise over
his bank balance than over his fellow-citizens; and whilst the former is some-
times denounced as being but a means to the latter, sometimes at least it is an
alternative.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Profit-seeking behavior and competition defined a vision of a better soci-
ety where the darker passions of human beings are kept under control by the
pursuit of profit. With free trade, according to this view, one need not see an
enemy in a stranger, but instead a potential trading partner. Free trade and
competition present a form of moral education that brings about relatively
harmless bourgeois virtues and that suppresses the darker aspects of human
nature. Competition, within the context of free markets, has an explicitly
moral quality, because the alternatives are so much worse. This view found
its expression in Milton Friedman&rsquo;s famous example of discrimination in a
competitive economy (Friedman 1962, Ch. 7): &ldquo;It is a striking historical fact
that the development of capitalism has been accompanied by a major reduc-
tion in the extent to which particular religious, racial, or social groups have
operated under special handicaps in respect of their economic activities; have,
as the saying goes, been discriminated against. The substitution of contract
arrangements for status arrangements was the first step toward the freeing of
the serfs in the Middle Ages. The preservation of Jews through the Middle
Ages was possible because of the existence of a market sector in which they
could operate and maintain themselves despite official persecution.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>� Alienation: ˆSpecialization implies the division of labor. As soon as one gives
up autarky, one devotes one&rsquo;s professional life to a specialized task. The limit
of this process is, according to Adam Smith, only defined by the number of po-
tential trading partners: &ldquo;As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to
the division of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by
the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market.&rdquo; (Adam
Smith 1776, p. 21). Thus, the larger the number of potential trading partners is,
the more specialized the individual activities can be. The only additional lim-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38 2 Gains from Trade
</p>
<p>its come from coordination and transportation costs, which are inevitable when
production is partitioned into specialized tasks.
This view focuses exclusively on the material side: the production of &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; ma-
terial goods and services. However, this ignores the psychological consequences
for the people. Karl Marx (1844) was, perhaps, the most prominent thinker, who
stressed the implications of the division of labor on the ability of human beings to
experience a happy, autonomous, and meaningful life. He described the concept
of Entfremdung, or alienation, as the costs of living in a socially stratified and
specialized society where each individual is just a little cog in a big wheel, with-
out autonomy of his time and the products he contributes to, and his managers
merely value him as a factor of production.
However, the idea of alienation goes back, at least, to Adam Smith. He expresses
the idea very poignantly in The Wealth of Nations: &ldquo;In the progress of the divi-
sion of labour, the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour
[. . . ] comes to be confined to a few very simple operations; frequently to one or
two. But the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by
their ordinary employments. The man whose whole life is spent in performing
a few simple operations, of which the effects too are, perhaps, always the same,
or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exer-
cise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never
occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally
becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for human creature to become.&rdquo;
He follows up on these ideas in his Lectures: &ldquo;Where the division of labour is
brought to perfection, every man has only a simple operation to perform; to this
his whole attention is confined, and few ideas pass in his mind but what have an
immediate connection with it. [. . . ] These are the disadvantages of a commer-
cial spirit. The minds of men are contracted and rendered incapable of elevation.
Education is despised, or at least neglected, and heroic spirit is almost utterly
extinguished. To remedy these defects would be an object worthy of serious
attention.&rdquo;
In order to be able to understand if specialization leads to alienation, in this
sense, one has to understand the meaning work has for human beings, which is
to a certain extent culture specific. Thus, the concept is inherently a cultural and
psychological one. What one can say, without digging deeper into this matter, is
that the production of goods and services is a means for some underlying end:
call it happiness, meaningful life, or whatever. A focus on the materialistic side
of production can, therefore, be too narrow to understand the implications of the
division of labor on individual wellbeing.

<p>2.4 Comparative Advantage and the Organization of Economic
Activity
</p>
<p>Growing up, I slowly had this process of realising that all the things around me that people
had told me were just the natural way things were [. . . ] weren&rsquo;t natural at all. They were
things that could be changed. (Aaron Swartz (2010))</p>
<p/>

<p>2.4 Comparative Advantage and the Organization of Economic Activity 39
</p>
<p>When will we realise that the fact that we can become accustomed to anything [. . . ] makes
it necessary to examine carefully everything we have become accustomed to? (George
Bernard Shaw (1930))
</p>
<p>I committed a major scientific crime in the last subchapter, because I was very
sloppy with respect to the terminology I used. I repeatedly referred to markets,
although the theory of comparative advantage is formulated as a technological prop-
erty, without any reference to specific institutions like markets. However, Adam
Smith (1776)[1991] and David Ricardo (2004) are brothers in arms, which makes
this crime, hopefully, forgivable. Examples of the effects of specialization and trade
are easier to find in market contexts and the political tensions and debates are also
results of market integration. For David Ricardo, it was reasonable to think of com-
parative advantages in market contexts, because he was thinking of opening up the
English economy to competition. What he found, however, was much more general
than a property of markets.
</p>
<p>� Consider the theory of comparative advantage within the organizational context
of a firm. The divisional structure of the firm (like accounting, marketing, strat-
egy, production, . . . ) reflects a specific form of division of labor. Employees
specialize as engineers, workers, or accountants with the expectation that the
whole is bigger than the sum of its parts. The within-firm exchange of goods,
services, and resources is, in general, not organized like a market, but follows
hierarchical rules that may, but need not, simulate market mechanisms (as, for
example, in the case of profit centers that exchange goods and resources on the
basis of firm-internal transfer prices).
</p>
<p>� Alternatively, looking at organizations like public research institutes or univer-
sities, scientists are extremely specialized, but their exchange of ideas is not
governed by market forces. Instead, to a large extent, this takes place in confer-
ences and in research seminars where scientists give away their ideas &ldquo;for free.&rdquo;
Competition for public research funds more closely resembles a contest where
the relatively best or most promising proposals get the funding.
</p>
<p>The examples ✍show that one can have a division of labor and an exchange of goods,
services, and resources without markets. A more fruitful perspective on the relation-
ship between the theory of comparative advantage and markets is to ask whether
markets are a good means to enable specialization and trade. Theory states that
people can alleviate scarcity by a process of specialization and exchange. The next
question has to then be: do they have to organize economic activities in a specific
way to make sure that the potential becomes actual gains from trade? This is the
question about institutions, which is at the heart of economics.
</p>
<p>According to Douglas North (1991), &ldquo;[i]nstitutions are the humanly devised
constraints that structure political, economic and social interaction. They consist
of both informal constraints (sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, and codes of
conduct), and formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights). Throughout his-
tory, human beings devised institutions to create order and reduce uncertainty in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 2 Gains from Trade
</p>
<p>exchange, either consciously or by cultural evolution. Together with the standard
constraints of economics they define the choice set and therefore determine transac-
tion and production costs and hence the profitability and feasibility of engaging in
economic activity. They evolve incrementally, connecting the past with the present
and the future; history in consequence is largely a story of institutional evolution
in which the historical performance of economies can only be understood as a part
of a sequential story. Institutions provide the incentive structure of an economy; as
that structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic change towards growth,
stagnation, or decline.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Economics, as the study of how men and society choose to employ scarce pro-
ductive resources, is therefore primarily the study of institutions. A market is one
example for an institution, a firm is a second, and centralized government planning
is a third. The study of the properties of different institutions will help develop an
understanding of how they function (positive science), to what extent they alleviate
scarcity and how they distribute goods, services, and resources (positive as well as
normative science).
</p>
<p>From a philosophical point of view, institutions are very peculiar. Searle (2010)
reconstructs the ontology of institutions as a specific class of speech acts called
&ldquo;declarations.&rdquo; Humans possess &ldquo;the capacity to impose functions on objects and
people where the objects and the people cannot perform the functions solely in
virtue of their physical structure. The performance of the function requires that
there be a collectively recognized status that the person or object has, and it is only
in virtue of that status that the person or object can perform the function in ques-
tion.&rdquo; Institutions come into being by the repeated applications of specific linguistic
representations (declarations), and they cease to exist as soon as people no longer
collectively recognize their status. They are, at the same time, epistemologically ob-
jective and ontologically subjective: there can be no doubt that an institution exists
within a given convention, but the convention itself is, to a certain extent, arbitrary.
</p>
<p>Take the convention or institution &ldquo;Switzerland&rdquo; as an example. There is a
mutually recognized consensus that Switzerland exists, as a legal entity and as
an institution; thus, it makes no sense for a single human being to deny its exis-
tence and act on its territory according to, for example, Russian law. In this sense,
the institution &ldquo;Switzerland&rdquo; objectively exists. However, as soon as the people
in Switzerland (and the rest of the world) deny that Switzerland exists, it actually
ceases to exist, which makes it ontologically subjective. Its existence relies on a
convention. This is different, for example, from the Matterhorn, which continues
to exist even if seven billion people deny its existence; it is ontologically objective.
The hybrid nature of institutions distinguishes them from most phenomena studied
in the natural sciences: they are products of &ldquo;shared fantasies.&rdquo; Property rights, as an
integral requirement for markets, do not exist independently of human beings: their
existence relies on a mutual consensus. The same is true for money, the state, firms,
and so on. The most fundamental declarative speech act is language itself: there is
nothing inherent in the ontological object &ldquo;chair&rdquo; that requires one to call it a chair:
it could just as well be called a &ldquo;Stuhl.&rdquo; The partition of phenomena, according to
the rules of a language, has far-reaching implications for one&rsquo;s perception of reality.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Digression 6. What is Ontology and Epistemology? ˆ
In philosophy, ontology is the study of &ldquo;what there is,&rdquo; of the nature of being
and reality. It studies problems concerning the entities that do exist and their
properties. Examples of ontological questions include the following: What
is existence? What is the nature of existence? What principles govern the
</p>
<p>properties of matter?
</p>
<p>Epistemology is the study of knowledge and justified belief. Questions that
it addresses may include: What are the necessary and sufficient conditions of
knowledge? How does one separate true ideas from false ideas? How does
</p>
<p>one know what is true?
</p>
<p>In other words, ontology is about what is true and epistemology is about
the methods of figuring out those truths.
</p>
<p>The specific ontology of institutions makes economics special among the sci-
ences. In the words of Rosenberg and Curtain (2013), &ldquo;[u]nlike the physical world,
the domain of economics includes a wide range of social &ldquo;constructions&rdquo; &ndash; insti-
tutions like markets and objects like currency and stock shares &ndash; that even when
idealized don&rsquo;t behave uniformly. They are made up of unrecognized but artificial
conventions that people persistently change and even destroy in ways that no social
scientist can really anticipate. We can exploit gravity, but we can&rsquo;t change it or de-
stroy it. No one can say the same for the socially constructed causes and effects of
our choices that economics deals with.&rdquo; This potential fluidity of institutions makes
them inherently difficult to study. Here is an example: money relies on the social
convention that people are willing to accept it as a medium of exchange, because it
cannot directly be consumed. As soon as this convention starts to unravel, money
loses its value; it is ontologically subjective. In order to have a reliable theory of
money, economists cannot simply assume its existence; they have to identify the
individual and group processes that determine its emergence and sustainability.
</p>
<p>To summarize, the theory of comparative advantage can explain why people or-
ganize economic activities. They are organized by means of institutions, which is
why economics is the study of such institutions. The major part of this book will be
devoted to the analysis of markets as &ndash; together with democracy &ndash; the most promi-
nent institution in bourgeois societies. However, it should be clear by now that
markets are only one way to organize economic activities, among many others.

<p>3.1 General Remarks
</p>
<p>The chapter ✍on the theory of comparative advantage has revealed that the problem of
scarcity can be alleviated, if individuals are willing to specialize according to their
comparative advantages and then find a way to allocate goods and services that is
mutually beneficial. I have further argued that this process cannot be expected to
unfold without an adequate institutional &ldquo;frame&rdquo; within which specialization and
exchange can take place. A market is one such institution; it is the most important
institution that fosters specialization and exchange and is the foundation on which
modern capitalist societies are built. Informally speaking, a market is a framework
that allows potential buyers and sellers to exchange goods, services, and informa-
tion.
</p>
<p>In Lorder to make these transactions possible, a market relies on private property
rights and contract law. ✍Property rights define individual spheres of control over
objects and they allow individuals to determine in which ways these objects shall
be used and thus create a distinction between &lsquo;mine&rsquo; and &lsquo;yours.&rsquo; Without such a
distinction, it would be impossible to establish markets and trade, because it would
be unclear who has the right to control and use these objects. Property rights can be
absolute, giving the owner of an object the freedom to use it in any way she wants,
but in most societies there are socially agreed upon restrictions on the use of one&rsquo;s

<p>46 3 Introduction
</p>
<p>property. Restrictions may occur, if some uses impede on the well-being of others
or are in conflict with moral values.
</p>
<p>An important✍ example of objects for which many countries have constrained the
rights of the owner is the ownership of land, which is called real estate or immovable
property. Land development, types of uses and the architecture of buildings are
subject to constraints and regulations, and some countries limit individual rights
even further by preventing them from using real estate in the way most preferred
by the owner (for example by construing the right to abandon one&rsquo;s buildings).
Therefore, it is more adequate to think of property rights as those user rights that
society leaves to the formal owner. The technical term for these rights is residual
control rights.
</p>
<p>Digression 7. Property Rights Enforcementˆ
It is vital to distinguish between the mutual recognition and the enforcement
of property rights. People are used to thinking of property-rights enforcement
as a centralized activity delegated to &ldquo;the state.&rdquo; An important proponent of
this view was Max Weber (1988), who observed that the modern state has
monopolized the legitimate use of force. According to this point of view, the
state provides for public enforcement and, with a few exceptions like self-
help, limits private enforcement of property rights. This has not always been
the case. The private enforcement of rights has been of considerable impor-
tance historically, for example in late medieval Europe. The development
of the code of conduct called &ldquo;Lex Mercatoria,&rdquo; in the 11th and 12th cen-
tury, is seen as one of the key factors for the economic success of Europe,
which arched over into the Renaissance. This helped to overcome the limited
possibilities of centralized law enforcement in a politically fragmented Eu-
rope. According to Berman (1983), &ldquo;[t]his legal system&rsquo;s rules were privately
produced, privately adjudicated, and privately enforced.&rdquo; The system became
effective exactly because medieval Europe was plagued by a maze of frag-
mented states, whose rulers more closely resembled self-interested elites. In
certain respects, the situation in medieval Europe looks similar to the situation
of the globalized economy of today, where multinational firms are confronted
with nation-states that lack a centralized agency, which enforces contracts.
</p>
<p>The factL that markets rely on property rights implies that every transaction on a
market has a &ldquo;physical&rdquo;✍ and a &ldquo;legal&rdquo; side. The physical side of a transaction is the
exchange of goods, services, or information (I will henceforth speak of goods and
services, implicitly assuming that information can be interpreted as a specific kind
of service) whereas, from a legal perspective, a transaction is an exchange of rights.
In order to be able to exchange rights, it is necessary to specify the conditions under
which such a transaction is binding. An exchange of rights is specified in a contract
and the rules that apply to the establishment of such contracts are specified in a
society&rsquo;s contract law.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.1 General Remarks 47
</p>
<p>Digression 8. Self Ownership ˆ
An often bypassed constituent element of private property is self-ownership,
which is an important virtue and achievement of modern bourgeois society.
Self-ownership excludes serfdom and slavery and is a necessary prerequisite
for ownership rights over objects in the outside world. It is also important for
the establishment of transactions of services like, for example, the time and
expertise a person offers on labor markets. Usually, a labor contract specifies
the duties of the employer as well as of the employee. Self-ownership makes
these contracts possible and, at the same time, defines limits to contractual
freedom, because it, for example, prohibits a person from voluntarily selling
herself into slavery.
</p>
<p>The very brief Ldiscussion of the institutional prerequisites for a market economy
&ndash; private property as residual control rights plus contract law &ndash; reveals that there is
a close relationship between the legal and economic aspects of the study of mar-
kets. The civil law of a society implicitly defines the extent to which markets can
develop and what they can achieve, while the economic analysis of the functioning
of markets can inform the legal scholar about the likely consequences of legal rules.
The importance of the interaction between a legal and an economic perspective is
reflected in the fact that a whole field of analysis called &ldquo;Law and Economics&rdquo; has
emerged, which is devoted to the analysis of the relationship between legal rules,
individual behavior, and social outcomes.
</p>
<p>Assume that a society has established a system of private property rights, which
assigns residual rights of control over objects to individuals and contract laws,
which specify the conditions under which the ownership of rights can be transferred.
The individuals can now start to exchange these rights, given the rules specified in
contract law. The rights-based approach to markets is straightforward but, at the
same time, may be a little too abstract to define a good or service as any (bundle of)
right(s) an individual may be interested in buying or selling. These rights can be
anything from the right to eat an apple to the right to acquire a share in a company
twelve months from now, if the share price is above a certain threshold.
</p>
<p>Basically, there are ✍two ways to establish trade. In a barter economy, goods and
services are exchanged for other goods and services, like two apples for a loaf of
bread. Most modern societies, however, rely on an abstract medium of exchange:
money. At this point, it is not necessary to explicitly distinguish between economies
that barter and economies that use money as a medium of exchange, but the follow-
ing digression discusses the &ldquo;nature&rdquo; of money:
</p>
<p>Digression 9. Money
</p>
<p>One of humanity&rsquo;s major achievements has been the invention of an abstract
medium of exchange for facilitating the exchange of goods or trade. This
medium of exchange is called money. Money is traditionally regarded as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48 3 Introduction
</p>
<p>having three functions: it acts as a medium of exchance, a unit of accounting
and as a means of storing value.
</p>
<p>Given that most people grew up in societies where money is almost as
pervasive as the air we breathe, it is easy to oversee these three really peculiar
aspects of money. First, compared to a barter economy where transactions
can only take place if the supply and demand of two individuals perfectly
align (which is called the &ldquo;double coincidence of want&rdquo;), the use of money
dramatically facilitates this exchange, because it no longer depends on this
coincidence.
</p>
<p>Second, given that money has no intrinsic value and merely represents
an abstract promise to be convertible into directly useful goods and services
in the future, it is a convention in the sense of Searle, see Chap. 2. Thus, its
invention relies on abstract thinking and trust (it most likely evolved from debt
certificates) and the historic development of money shows people&rsquo;s increasing
ability of thinking in abstract ways about the use and nature of money. The
step from gold and silver coins (used by the Lydian&rsquo;s around 500-600 BC) to
paper money (from the 7th century AD in China and the 13th century AD in
Europe), and then from Banknotes backed by Gold (Bretton-Woods System)
to unbacked money, and finally to a perfectly abstract unit of exchange in the
digital age, show an increasingly abstract way of thinking.
</p>
<p>Third, in opposition to directly useful goods and services, the value of
money results from a social convention. Money has value only insofar as
people are willing to accept it as a medium of exchange. This explains why
the value of money, and of currencies, is inherently fragile, because the value
of banknotes and coins (and, even worse, of purely abstract forms of money)
drops to almost zero (which is an extreme form of inflation) as soon as people
lose faith in its future value and start rejecting it as a medium of exchange,
despite the fact that everyone would be better off, if money was accepted.
</p>
<p>Assume that an exchange rate between goods and services, or a monetary price,
exists. In the case of money, a person who is willing to give away (some of) her
residual rights of control in exchange for the given price is called a seller of these
rights (and the associated goods and services), while a person who is willing to
acquire (some) residual rights of control from another person, in exchange for the
given price, is called a buyer. The example of a barter economy, where one good
is necessarily exchanged for another, makes it clear that a person is necessarily a
buyer and a seller at the same time, because she has to give up apples for potatoes
or vice versa. This reciprocity of supply and demand carries over to monetary
economies, if one reminds oneself that money is an abstract promise to acquire
goods and services in the future and, therefore, a bundle of rights. Thus, buying
apples for money means that one person acquires control rights over apples (buyer)
and the other gives up control rights over future consumption (seller). Hence, one
should bear in mind that any transaction in a market is necessarily complemented
by a transaction on some other market.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.2 Taxonomy of Markets 49
</p>
<p>3.2 Taxonomy of Markets
</p>
<p>The remainder of this book will take the existence of property rights and contract
law as given and develop a taxonomy of different markets. Table 3.1 gives an
overview of the most important market structures. It is common to distinguish sup-
ply and demand according to the number of buyers and sellers on a market. It is also
customary to distinguish between one buyer or seller, a few buyers or sellers, and
many buyers or sellers. This taxonomy defines nine prototypical market structures,
each one with its own distinctive, functional logic. First of all, one should focus on
the three market structures that will be analyzed in greater detail in the following
chapters: polypoly, oligopoly, and monopoly.
</p>
<p>A polypoly has many buyers and sellers of a homogenous good or service. ✍Goods
or services from different suppliers are called homogenous, if the potential buyers
are not willing or able to distinguish between them and, therefore, consider them as
perfectly interchangeable. The term &ldquo;many&rdquo; has a specific meaning in this context,
as well. It refers to a situation where each buyer or seller considers her influence in
the market so negligible that she does not have any influence on the market price.
The buyers and sellers are therefore price takers, and the market is also called per-
fectly competitive. A market with perfect competition is the workhorse model for
a lot of problems analyzed by economists, ranging from the determination of mar-
ket prices, to the effects of taxes and to the determinants of international trade. In
addition, this market is relatively easy to analyze, which is why this analysis of mar-
ket economies starts with this case. Examples for markets that approximate perfect
competition are:
</p>
<p>� Some agrarian resources, like wheat, approximate perfect competition, because
an international commodities market exists for these approximately homogenous
resources, which implies a large number of producers (farmers) and buyers.
</p>
<p>� The stock exchange is, in principle, also a good example for a competitive
market, but one has to be cautious, because of institutional investors who can,
generally, influence prices.
</p>
<p>However, for reasons that will become apparent later on, not many markets can
be adequately described as polypolistic. The reason why economics textbooks still
focus on a market structure that is apparently unrealistic or not very common is
because its simplicity allows one to understand fundamental properties of market
transactions. Furthermore, it also acts as a reference point for more complicated
markets. More realistic markets, like monopolies or oligopolies, are more complex
to analyze but, fortunately, the additional complexity is relatively easy to digest

<p>50 3 Introduction
</p>
<p>because it is, in a sense, additive: the functioning of the most basal monopolistic
market can be analyzed using the understanding derived from competitive markets,
plus additional layers of complexity.
</p>
<p>These additional layers of complexity exist because the seller on a monopolistic
market understands that she is the only seller of a specific good or service, which
gives her a certain power to influence prices. Hence, the assumption of price-taking
behavior is no longer adequate and one has to understand how this additional factor
influences supply and demand. The first known mention of a monopoly goes all the
way back to Aristotle who, in his &ldquo;Politics,&rdquo; describes the market for olive presses
as a monopoly. More recently, De Beers had a monopoly in raw diamonds be-
fore countries like Russia, Canada, and Australia emerged as alternative distributers
of diamonds. Public utilities that maintain infrastructures like electricity, water,
sewage, etc. usually also have regional monopolies.
</p>
<p>On the same note, the functioning✍ of the most basic oligopolistic market can be
analyzed using the understanding derived from monopolistic markets, plus yet an-
other layer of complexity. With only a few suppliers, each of them has, in principle,
some control over prices, but they have to take their competitors&rsquo; likely behavior
into consideration. Such strategic considerations are not necessary in monopolis-
tic markets, because there are no competitors. They are also obsolete in perfectly
competitive markets, because no supplier is able to influence the market. This
is no longer the case with a limited number of competitors, because the optimal
behavior of one supplier, in general, depends on the behavior of her competitors.
This situation is defined as strategically interdependent and an analysis of markets
with strategically interdependent decisions will be the capstone of this introductory
textbook. Formally, an oligopoly is a market where a limited number of suppliers
sell homogenous goods. Here are some examples:
</p>
<p>� The grocery market in Switzerland is dominated by Coop and Migros.
� The market for wireless telephone services in Switzerland is dominated by
</p>
<p>Swisscom, Sunrise, and Salt.
� The worldwide accountancy market is dominated by PriceWaterhouseCoopers,
</p>

<p>Bearing the increasing complexity of different market structures in mind, the struc-
ture of the following chapters is straightforward: they start with a relatively simple
market structure that is easy to understand, continue with a market structure that
better describes a lot of markets that one is confronted with on an almost daily ba-
sis and that is of moderate complexity, and finish with the most complex market
structure.
</p>
<p>The taxonomy in Table 3.1 encompasses not only three, but nine market struc-
tures. Even if I only explicitly cover the above-mentioned three in this introductory
textbook, I will discuss the other structures&rsquo; peculiarities briefly.
</p>
<p>Monopsonistic and oligopsonistic markets are mirror images of monopolistic
and oligopolistic markets and the main insights that can be derived from the latter
can also be applied to the former.</p>
<p/>

<p>3.2 Taxonomy of Markets 51
</p>
<p>A bilateral monopoly, however, confronts one with a totally different situation,
because both sides of the market possess some market power, which derives from
the fact that the trading partner cannot fall back on some other identical alternative,
if trade does not take place. Such a situation arises because manufacturers and
suppliers often customize their production processes and products to the needs of
their trading partners, with the result that the manufacturer cannot sell the tailored
products at the same price to other trading partners and the trading partner has
difficulties finding adequate substitutes on the market. Here are some additional
examples:
</p>
<p>� Collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) between labor unions and (especially
large) companies or employers&rsquo; associations,
</p>
<p>� highly specialized scientists and their employers (e.g. pharmaceutical companies
and their lead scientists; both would have difficulties finding adequate alterna-
tives, at least in the short run),
</p>
<p>� governments and some of their defense contractors (an extreme example is the
market for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, where the US government is the
only buyer and Huntington Ingalls Industries is the only seller);
</p>
<p>� marriage (think about it: dissolving a partnership is costly so, even if one thinks
that one has found an even better match, one may decide not to dissolve it).
</p>
<p>Analytically, the challenge lies in understanding the factors that influence the suc-
cess of the resulting bilateral negotiations and the distribution of the potential gains
from trade between the buyer and seller. The field of research that analyses these
questions is called bargaining theory.
</p>
<p>The three remaining market structures, bilateral oligopoly, restricted monopoly
and restricted monopsony, are far less studied. The basic challenge in understand-
ing the functioning of these markets, and the corresponding optimal strategies, is
how varying degrees of competitiveness influence the bargaining power of a single
buyer or seller. An example is the retail industry: historically, the supply side was
concentrated and the demand side was rather competitive in the corresponding mar-
kets, but demand-side concentration greatly increased over the last forty years or
so. The grocery sector in Germany is a case at hand and the trend towards concen-
tration was reinforced by the formation of buyer groups. In 2014, the five largest
buyer groups had a market share of more than 80%.
</p>
<p>Another commonly analyzed market form, which does not appear in Table 3.1,
is called monopolistic competition. The model of monopolistic competition blends
elements from the monopoly with elements from the polypoly model. Basically, it
is assumed that firms behave like monopolists and that firms can produce similar,
but not identical, products. A good example is the market for sports-utility vehicles
(SUVs), where each major car company sells its own variant of SUV. All of them
are similar, but a lot of customers have their favorite brands. The model of monop-
olistic competition is very useful, if one is interested in determining the number of
competitors that a market can sustain.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>52 3 Introduction
</p>
<p>The above line of argumentation assumes that the number of buyers or sellers
has an important influence on the functioning of a market and one will get a deeper
understanding of this conjecture throughout the following chapters. However, there
are two questions that should come to mind at the present stage. First, it is un-
clear what determines the market structure. Is it possible to organize markets for
arbitrary goods and services at will, or are there underlying explanatory factors that
determine whether a specific good or service is traded on a perfectly competitive
or on a monopolistic market, or on a completely different one? Second, how many
are &ldquo;few&rdquo; and how many are &ldquo;many?&rdquo; If the dividing line between few and many is
important for the functioning of a market, it would be helpful if one could attach a
number to this question.
</p>
<p>An exhaustive answer✍ to these questions is beyond the scope of an introductory
textbook, but the following chapters will shed a little light on the subject. Regarding
question one, economists usually distinguish between markets and industries. An
industry is a sector of the economy that produces a specific type of good; it is better
characterized by the technological way of production that summarizes the physical,
biological, and chemical laws that convert the resources needed for production (in-
puts) into products (outputs). This relationship between inputs and outputs is also
called the technology of production. As Chap. 8 illustrates, industries differ with
respect to the laws linking inputs with outputs and these laws have an important
influence on the possible market structures. Furthermore, the perception of goods
and services by the &ldquo;buyers&rdquo; (customers) has a direct impact on the market struc-
ture. If they can, or are willing to, distinguish between, for example, red wine and
white wine, all producers of red wine are in the same market for &ldquo;red wine.&rdquo; If the
customers, however, distinguish between different types of grapes, region of origin,
producer, or even characteristics of the vineyard, the market for red wine explodes
into a plethora of differentiated markets, where even small local producers may
have the market power to influence prices. I will discuss this phenomenon further
in Chap. 10. Last, but not least, the legal framework determines market structures.
Most countries have, for example, a competition law, the purpose of which is to
guarantee a minimum degree of competitiveness on each market, thereby excluding
monopolies. However, the opposite can be true as well: patent law, for example,
grants the patent holder a temporarily restricted monopoly for those products that
can be developed from his patent. In summary, market structure is not completely
arbitrary, but it depends, in a complex way, on the technology of production, the
perception of goods and services by customers, and the legal framework.
</p>
<p>With respect to the second question, the answer is even more difficult. Remem-
ber that the dividing line between &ldquo;few&rdquo; and &ldquo;many&rdquo; is the perception of one side of
the market that the price is de-facto given. There are industries for which two sellers
or two buyers are &ldquo;many&rdquo; (there is an example in Chap. 12), and other industries,
where a much larger number of competitors is necessary to more closely approach
price-taking behavior. Experiments for so-called Cournot markets have shown that
the magic number seems to be between two and four.
</p>
<p>With these prerequisites, it is now time to analyze the functioning of the first
type of market: a market with perfect competition.</p>

<p>4.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>From the time of Adam Smith&rsquo;s Wealth of Nations in 1776, one recurrent theme of eco-
nomic analysis has been the remarkable degree of coherence among the vast numbers of
individual and seemingly separate decisions about the buying and selling of commodities.
In everyday, normal experience, there is something of a balance between the amounts of
goods and services that some individuals want to supply and the amounts that other, dif-
ferent individuals want to sell. Would-be buyers ordinarily count correctly on being able
to carry out their intentions, and would-be sellers do not ordinarily find themselves pro-
ducing great amounts of goods that they cannot sell. This experience of balance is indeed
so widespread that it raises no intellectual disquiet among laymen; they take it so much
for granted that they are not disposed to understand the mechanism by which it occurs.
(Kenneth Arrow (1974))
</p>
<p>This chapter will start with a basic initial analysis on the functioning of competitive
markets. One may remember, from the last chapter, that everyone acts as a buyer
and a seller simultaneously. I buy groceries and other consumer goods in the local
stores or on the Internet and, in turn, sell my time and expertise to my employer.
In order to have a lean terminology, it is therefore necessary to interpret buyers
and sellers as artificial roles, both of which one adopts, depending on the good or
service one is considering. For the purposes of this book, the terms seller, firm, and
company as well as buyer, consumer, and customer will be used interchangeably,

<p>56 4 Supply and Demand Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>keeping in mind that not only firms sell and that not only (end-)consumers buy
goods and services.
</p>
<p>The two most fundamental concepts in the analysis of markets are supply and de-
mand. These measure the quantity of a given good or service, which customers are
willing to buy and firms are willing to sell at a given market price, as well as other
explanatory factors like income, expectations about the future, prices of resources,
and so on. In order to be able to study the functioning of perfectly competitive
markets, one has to develop theories that explain the market&rsquo;s demand-side and its
supply-side, as well as the interaction between the two sides.
</p>
<p>4.2 Determinants of Supply and Demand
</p>
<p>In order to be able to create these theories, one has to distinguish between the de-
mand of a single individual (one&rsquo;s demand of apricots) and market demand (the
demand of all individuals, who buy apricots in Switzerland). On that note, one also
has to distinguish between the supply of a single firm (the supply of apricots in
one&rsquo;s local grocery store) and market supply (the supply of all firms selling apricots
in Switzerland).
</p>
<p>Given that this chapter is a primer in competitive markets, it will motivate sup-
ply and demand heuristically by means of plausibility considerations. A full-sized
microeconomic theory of markets replaces these plausibility considerations by a
decision-theoretic foundation, which traditionally assumes that individuals can
rank alternatives according to their preferences and determine demand and supply
by choosing the most highly ranked alternative available. This kind of decision-
theoretic foundation of supply and demand is, from a scientific point of view,
preferable. However, it comes at the cost of added complexity, so it makes sense to
skip it during our first passage through the logic of competitive markets. We will
develop the underlying decision theory in Chap. 7.
</p>
<p>Demand✍ One can start this endeavor with the analysis a single customer&rsquo;s demand
for a given good. Assume that there are n goods in total among which a customer,
j , can choose. n is a natural number larger than 1, and the goods are numbered
1; 2; : : :; n.
</p>
<p>� It is reasonable to assume that the quantity of the good i (kilos of apricots), xji ,
demanded by customer j most likely depends on the price of the good, pi (CHF
per kilo), as well as on the prices of other goods p1; p2; : : :; pi�1; piC1; : : :; pn
(for example, the price for a kilo of pears, as well as the price for a kilo of bread).
</p>
<p>� In addition to prices, other factors will also likely influence demand. A promi-
nent candidate is the customer&rsquo;s income or wealth, bj (for budget, which is the
amount of money the customer can spend on purchases).
</p>
<p>� On a more profound level, the demand is also influenced by the customer&rsquo;s
tastes, which are called the customer&rsquo;s preferences. Different customers may
have different preferences and they, of course, have an influence on the demand</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.2 Determinants of Supply and Demand 57
</p>
<p>for goods. A vegetarian will spend nothing on meat, an outdoorsy person will
spend part of her budget on hiking boots and other outdoor equipment, etc.
</p>
<p>� The last factor, which is likely to influence the customer&rsquo;s demand for some
good i , is her expectations for the future. They include expectations about gen-
eral economic development, life expectancy, career perspectives, and so forth.
For example, expectations about the impact of climate change may influence
a person&rsquo;s consumption pattern, leading to more environment-friendly choices.
Alternatively, the expectations about the future innovative drive of different com-
panies may influence her investment strategy.
</p>
<p>This list ✍is not meant to be exhaustive, but it summarizes some of the key explana-
tory factors for individual demand. Hence, this is a formulation of the first causal
hypothesis that will play an important role in the model of the competitive markets
that are going to be developed: prices, budget, preferences, and expectations are the
explanatory or exogenous variables, whereas individual demand is the explained or
endogenous variable. Neglecting preferences and expectations for the rest of this
chapter, one can write this causal hypothesis of the demand of customer j for good i
in the form of a mathematical function xji .p1; : : :; pn; b
</p>
<p>j /. This complicated piece
of notation has the following interpretation: the quantity of the good that is de-
manded by the customer, xji , is explained by all the prices, p1; : : :; pn, and income,
bj . A function of several variables is, therefore, a straightforward extension of a
function with one variable, which a college student should know from high-school.
The premise of competitive markets, in which all buyers are too small to influence
prices, is reflected in the fact that prices are explanatory variables and, therefore,
independent of the behavior of the customer.
</p>
<p>Table 4.1 shows the demand of customer A, Ann, for apricots based on different
prices of apricots. Ann would buy two kilos, if the price were CHF 6 per kilo,
and her demand would increase to 6 kilos, if the price were to sink to CHF 2 per
kilo. Why should the demand go up, if the price goes down? It could, for example,
be that a reduction in the price of apricots induces a change in behavior, because
Ann likes different types of fruit equally well and, therefore, decides to save some
money by going for the, now, relatively cheaper ones, and substituting, for example,
cherries with apricots.

<p>This table is called an individual demand schedule✍ and it is a perfectly sound way
of representing demand. However, this kind of a table places a heavy load on one&rsquo;s
cognitive resources, which is why economists usually analyze demand through the
use of a graph.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.1 is a✍ graphical representation of the demand schedule in Table 4.1. This
figure has the good&rsquo;s price on the ordinate and the quantity demanded on the ab-
scissa. It is easy to verify that the individual demand function, xAi .pi /, summarizes
the same information as the demand schedule.
</p>
<p>One will have noticed by now that economists have an apparently odd conven-
tion regarding the axes of the diagram. Most students learned in school that the
explanatory variable is drawn along the horizontal axis, and the explained variable
is drawn along the vertical axis. If this is the case, the opposite convention used
by economists will likely drive one crazy during the first few weeks. However,
economists have a good reason for this deviating convention: from the point of
view of a customer, the price is given. However, what one is ultimately interested
in is the determination of prices by the interplay of supply and demand. Thus,
the determination of supply and demand is only an intermediate step on one&rsquo;s way
towards understanding the market. In the end, the &ldquo;old&rdquo; convention will hold again.
</p>
<p>In order to determine✍ prices, however, one needs an additional intermediate step
that brings one from individual to market demand. Table 4.2 shows A&rsquo;s as well as
B&rsquo;s (Bill&rsquo;s) demand for apricots. Assuming that A and B are the only customers,
one can get from the individual demand schedules to the market demand schedule</p>

<p>by adding up the individual demands for each price. Market demand is shown in
column four.
</p>
<p>It is, of course, also possible ✍to analyze market demand by the use of demand
functions, as one can see in Fig. 4.2. In this figure, xAi .pi / and x
</p>
<p>B
i .pi / denote
</p>
<p>Ann&rsquo;s and Bill&rsquo;s demand functions. In order to get from there to the market demand
function one has to add both demand functions horizontally (i.e. look for the total
demand for every possible price). The market demand function is the bold kinked
line denoted by xi.pi /. The kink results from the fact that only Ann is willing to
buy apricots, if the price is between CHF 8 and CHF 5.
</p>
<p>One can express the same relationship formally. Denote A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s demand for
good i (apricots, in this example) by xAi .p1; : : :; pn; b
</p>
<p>A/ and xBi .p1; : : :; pn; b
B /.
</p>
<p>Then the market demand function for good i can be denoted as:
</p>
<p>xi.p1; : : :; pn; b
A; bB/ D xAi .p1; : : :; pn; bA/C xBi .p1; : : :; pn; bB/:
</p>
<p>Realistically, there are more than two customers for a good in the economy, but the
same logic applies to the general case. Assume that there are m customers in total,
where m is a natural number, and that j is a generic customer with demand function</p>

<p>Now that✍ one has defined individual and market demand, one can introduce some
terminology, whichˆ will allow one to describe the different causal mechanisms that
link explanatory and explained variables that can be formulated for individual, as
well as market, demand. One defines them for an individual j . These mechanisms
are described with respect to the induced changes in demand, which are caused by
changes in the explanatory variables. This kind of exercise is called comparative
statics and lies at the heart of economics as a positive science. The reason why it
is so important, is because most of the testable predictions of economic theory are
predictions about changes in empirically identifiable endogenous variables, caused
by changes in empirically identifiable exogenous variables. The absolute value of
a variable, like demand, is often irrelevant and the models can usually be tailored
to meet the empirical patterns. However, changes in variables are often more ro-
bust and are, therefore, the only means to falsify a theory. The ability to produce
falsifiable hypotheses is crucial for Critical Rationalism, which is the mainstream
philosophy of science in economics, and is why comparative statics plays such an
important role. However, even more than that, most economic-policy questions are
also about the effects of changes in taxes, regulations and so on; or on changes in
employment, production and so forth.
</p>
<p>I Definition 4.1, Ordinary goods A good, i , is called ordinary, at given prices and
budget, if the demand for that good, xji , is decreasing with its price, pi .
</p>
<p>Note that this property is defined as a local one, if it holds for a given combina-
tion of explanatory variables. A good can be ordinary at some prices and incomes,
and not ordinary at others. The basic idea behind Definition 4.1 is that, if the price
increases, the demand decreases; this is the most common type of good. However,
this need not be the case and there are a lot of empirical examples showing that
the demand for a good can be increasing with its price. Examples for goods that
are not ordinary are those that are primarily purchased to signal status, but are oth-
erwise of limited intrinsic value (they have to be expensive to function as a status
symbol) or goods whose prices are interpreted as a quality signal by the customers.
These goods are called Giffen goods, named after Robert Giffen, who studied this
phenomenon.
</p>
<p>I Definition 4.2, Giffen goods A good, i , is called a Giffen good, at given prices
and budget, if its demand, xji , increases with its price, pi .
</p>
<p>I Definition 4.3, Normal goods A good, i , is called normal, at given prices and
budgets, if the demand for that good, xji , increases with an increasing budget, b
</p>
<p>j .</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.2 Determinants of Supply and Demand 61
</p>
<p>The name &ldquo;normal good&rdquo; is also suggestive, because it seems intuitive that in-
dividuals will buy more of a good, if they get richer. However, there are important
exceptions from this rule, especially cheaper goods of perceived low-quality that
will be substituted by higher-quality goods (as perceived by the customer), if she
gets richer. Examples are cheap food that is replaced by high-quality food, or cheap
used cars that are replaced by more expensive new ones. These goods are covered
by the next definition.
</p>
<p>I Definition 4.4, Inferior goods A good, i , is called inferior, at given prices and
budgets, if the demand for that good, xji , decreases with an increasing budget, b
</p>
<p>j .
</p>
<p>The next definitions describe the relationship between different goods:
</p>
<p>I Definition 4.5, Substitutes A good, i , is called a substitute for good k, at given
prices and budgets, if the demand for that good, xji , increases with an increase in
price, pk .
</p>
<p>An intuitive example for two goods that are substitutes is two different, but sim-
ilar, types of wine. If the price of, for example, Chianti goes up, the customer
substitutes it with Barolo. (Bear in mind, however, that the example may or may
not be correct for a given customer: it is ultimately an empirical question whether
she is willing to substitute one type of wine for another.) However, a different
relationship is also possible:
</p>
<p>I Definition 4.6, Complements A good, i , is called a complement for good k, at
given prices and budgets, if the demand for that good, xji , decreases with an increase
in price, pk .
</p>
<p>If one has ever wondered why shoes are sold in pairs, the concept of com-
plementarity gives one a clue: for most people, left and right shoes are perfect
complements: they always need a pair of them. If they were sold separately, an
increase in the price of left shoes would reduce the demand for right shoes and vice
versa. Another example for two goods that are complementary is printers and toner,
because one can only print, if one has both.
</p>
<p>Table 4.3 summarizes the comparative-static effects.
With these definitions, one can now analyze the demand-side of the market. This
</p>
<p>is done graphically and, in order to do, one sticks to the convention that the price
of a good is drawn along the ordinate and its quantity along the abscissa. In order

</p>
<p>to be able to isolate the effects of a single explanatory variable on an explained
variable, economists decompose complex changes in the explanatory variables into
simple ones, where the effect of each explanatory variable on the explained variable
is analyzed separately (comparative statics), and the possible, comparative-static
experiments for our model are changes in the price of the good, changes in the price
of other goods and changes in income. A change in the price of the good can be
analyzed by a movement along the demand curve, as illustrated in Fig. 4.3.
</p>
<p>Changes in the prices of other goods or income have an influence on the location
of the demand function. There are two potential effects: a rightward or a leftward
shift of the demand function. Both are illustrated in Fig. 4.4.
</p>
<p>Please verify that the demand for the good shifts outwards (inwards), if
</p>
<p>� the good is normal and income goes up (down),
� the good is inferior and income goes down (up),
� the price of a substitute good goes up (down), or
� the price of a complementary good goes down (up).
</p>
<p>Given the comparative-static effects covered by the definitions, this list gives one a
comprehensive overview of the possible effects. The art and craft of economics is
to identify situations that can be analyzed as price or income changes. An increase
in income taxes, for example, decreases the disposable income of the individual.</p>

<p>The economic effects on the goods markets can, therefore, be analyzed as if the
individual&rsquo;s income had decreased. Alternatively, rising immigration to a region
might increase the market value of real estate, which implies that the landlords&rsquo;
incomes go up.
</p>
<p>Before one can start to see how perfectly competitive markets work, the supply
side has to be introduced, as well.
</p>
<p>Supply The ✍derivation of the individual and market supply functions follows the
same steps as before, assuming that some good, i , is produced by a firm, j , of a
total of h firms. What are the likely determinants of firm j &rsquo;s supply decision, yji ,
(for example kilos of apricots)?
</p>
<p>� The price of the good pi (CHF per kilo of apricots) is likely to have an influence
on the quantity supplied.
</p>
<p>� Furthermore, ✍the good must be produced by the use of some resources (for the
apricot example, land, labor, fertilizer, etc.). Hence, the price of these resources
determines the profitability of the firm. These resources are also called inputs,
whereas the quantity produced is called an output. Physical, chemical or biolog-
ical laws causally link inputs and outputs. The production of goods requires all
kinds of inputs, resources and intermediate products. Economists customarily
restrict attention to two generic inputs called capital and labor, whose quantities</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>64 4 Supply and Demand Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>are denoted by k and l and whose prices (per unit) are denoted by r (which is the
interest rate the firm has to pay per unit of capital for borrowing it on the capital
market) and w (which is the wage rate the firm has to pay a worker per unit of
labor).
</p>
<p>� Given that the conversion of inputs into outputs follows the laws of physics,
chemistry and biology, the technology of production is also relevant for the sup-
ply decisions of the firm. For example, assume that a technological innovation
makes labor more productive, thus increasing the output per unit of labor by
20%. In that case, production becomes more profitable, implying that the firm,
ceteris paribus, is likely to produce more.
</p>
<p>� Again, similar to the determination of demand, the supply of some good, i , is
likely dependent on the firm&rsquo;s expectations for the future. If, for example, a firm
determines the medium- to long-run production capacity of its plants, then it has
to form expectations about future output and input prices, exchange rates (if part
of the production shall be exported), and so on. The more optimistic the firm&rsquo;s
expectations are, the more likely it is to invest in its capacity.
</p>
<p>This heuristic allows one to formulate the second causal hypothesis for one&rsquo;s model
of competitive markets: output and factor prices, technology of production, and
expectations are the explanatory or exogenous variables, whereas firm supply is the
explained or endogenous variable. As before, I will neglect all non-price variables
for the rest of this chapter, such that one can write this causal hypothesis for the
supply of firm j of good i in the form of a mathematical function, yji .pi ; w; r/,
</p>
<p>which reads as: the supply of good i by firm j , yji , is a function of (is explained
by) the price of the good, pi , and the prices of labor and capital, w; r .
</p>
<p>Digression 10. What is Capital?
</p>
<p>Capital is a key concept in economics and the eponym of the economic sys-
tem of capitalism. It, therefore, deserves some extra attention. The term goes
back to the Latin word caput, &ldquo;head,&rdquo; which is also the origin of cattle. This is
important, because it casts light on two basic properties a resource must have
in order to count as capital: the stock of cattle is moveable (which distin-
guishes it from land) and reproduces. Therefore, capital is any resource that
is potentially mobile and bears an interest, if it is not immediately consumed.
Adam Smith defined capital as &ldquo;[t]hat part of a man&rsquo;s stock which he expects
to afford him revenue [. . . ].&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The first resources economists had in mind when they used the term capi-
tal were livestock, machines and other tools. However, over time, the concept
got more abstract, covering other &ldquo;interest-bearing&rdquo; phenomena, as well. On
a very abstract level, capital consists of resources that enhance a person&rsquo;s
power when she uses her time to achieve her goals (Pierre Bourdieu (1983)).
This idea is nicely exemplified by the closely related German words &ldquo;Kapital&rdquo;
(capital) and &ldquo;Verm&ouml;gen&rdquo; (capability, which stems from the latin word capa-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.2 Determinants of Supply and Demand 65
</p>
<p>bilis, &ldquo;being able to grasp or hold&rdquo;, but is translated as &ldquo;assets&rdquo; in the system
of national accounts). One could say that capital is a resource that makes one
capable of achieving a goal. (This idea is also reflected by the fact that wealth
is counted as an asset, whereas capital is a liability, in the system of national
accounts.)
</p>
<p>Consequently, contemporary economists distinguish between three or four
different types of capital: physical, human, social and symbolic.
</p>
<p>Physical capital corresponds to the traditional concept, including ma-
chines, tools and so on.
</p>
<p>Human capital refers to the skills of a human being that make him or her
more productive in manipulating physical capital. It is the stock of knowledge
that allows an individual to use his or her labor in a productive way.
</p>
<p>Social capital refers to the network of friends that allows one to achieve
one&rsquo;s goals. It is the stock of social bonds and relationships that helps one
succeeding with one&rsquo;s plans and insures one against adverse events. For ex-
ample, information disseminated in a network of friends may allow one to
make better decisions, or one may profit from cooperative and altruistic be-
havior among friends. This has its roots in the preferential treatment group
members can expect from each other.
</p>
<p>Symbolic capital is a controversial concept, which is better established
in sociology than in economics. It refers to the ability of an individual to
achieve her goals because of honor, prestige or recognition and it depends
on the cultural norms and language games of a society. The concept allows
one to better understand the role of cultural conventions and ideologies within
societies and it, therefore, became important in gender studies. Here is an ex-
ample why: cultural norms and language games impose categories of thought
and perception upon individual social agents who, if they accept these cate-
gories unscrutinized, perceive the social order as legitimate. If women, for
example, do not consider it appropriate to become CEOs of firms, they do not
strive for these careers and, thereby, leave them to their male counterparts.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, human, social and symbolic capital are difficult to differenti-
ate, and some definitions have social and symbolic capital, as in special cases
of human capital.
</p>
<p>One can, ✍in principle, analyze individual and market supply using supply sched-
ules that are constructed analogously to the demand schedules introduced in the
previous subchapter. Given that a demand or supply schedule is a rather cumber-
some instrument for the analysis of markets and, given that this chapter has only
introduced demand schedules as an intermediate step to motivate demand curves,
one can immediately jump to individual and market supply functions.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.5 is a graphical representation of the supply of firm A (&ldquo;Alpha Limited&rdquo;)
of some good i . As before, the figure has the price of the good on the ordinate and
the quantity supplied on the abscissa.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 4.5 Firm A&rsquo;s supply curve
</p>
<p>The graph assumes that supply is increasing in the price of the good, which
is a very intuitive assumption, because a higher price &ndash; holding all other factors
constant &ndash; makes the good more profitable and encourages the firm to try to expand
production. However, there may be situations where supply is not upward sloping,
for example, in the short run, if a capacity constraint is binding. In the apricot case,
farming company Alpha limited may not be able to buy or rent additional land to
plant and harvest additional apricots, in the short run.
</p>
<p>The final step that one has to take is to move from individual to market supply.
Figure 4.6 shows A&rsquo;s, as well as B&rsquo;s (Beta Limited&rsquo;s), supply curves for apricots.
Assuming that A and B are the only producers, one can get from individual to
market supply curves in the following way: yAi .pi / and y
</p>
<p>B
i .pi / denote Alpha&rsquo;s and
</p>
<p>Beta&rsquo;s supply functions. In order to get from there to the market-supply function,
one has to add both supply functions horizontally (i.e. look for the total supply for
every possible price). The market-supply function is the bold kinked line, denoted
by yi .pi /. The kink results from the fact that only Alpha is willing to sell apricots,
if the price is below a certain threshold.
</p>
<p>Again, one can express the same relationship formally. Denote A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s
supplies of good i by yAi .pi ; r; w/ and y
</p>
<p>B
i .pi ; r; w/, then the market supply function
</p>
<p>for good i is:
yi .pi ; r; w/ D yAi .pi ; r; w/C yBi .pi ; r; w/:</p>

<p>Fig. 4.6 Firm A&rsquo;s and firm B&rsquo;s supply curves and the market supply curve
</p>
<p>This formulation implicitly assumes that both firms have access to capital and labor
at the same input prices. If both firms hire on different capital and labor markets,
they would likely face different interest rates and wages, which would then have to
be reflected by firm-specific indices rj and wj . This situation is likely to be rele-
vant, if the firms produce in different countries, like apricot farmers who produce in
Switzerland and apricot farmers who produce in Italy and export to Switzerland.
</p>
<p>If there are more than two firms producing a good, then market supply is the sum
of all firms&rsquo; supplies at a given market price. Thus, with a total of l firms, and j
being a generic firm with a supply of yji .pi ; r; w/, market supply for good i is given
as:
</p>
<p>yi .pi ; r; w/ D
l

</p>

i .pi ; r; w/:
</p>
<p>How do changes in input and output prices affect supply? In order to answer
this question one follows the same steps as before and graphically analyzes this
question in a figure where the price of a good is drawn along the ordinate and its
quantity along the abscissa. A change in the price of the good can be analyzed by a
movement along the supply curve (see Fig. 4.7).
</p>
<p>Changes in input prices have an influence on the location of the supply curve
and, again, it can either shift leftward or rightward, as illustrated in Fig. 4.8.
</p>
<p>What are plausible conjectures about the effect of changing input prices? If
production gets cheaper (more expensive), it is plausible to assume that firms will
increase (reduce) production. If this is the case, one can summarize the potential
effects as follows: the supply of the good shifts outwards, if wages or interest rates
go down, and vice versa. As before, the tricky thing is to identify real-life situations
that can adequately be described as changes in input prices.
</p>
<p>The fact that this textbook has thus far included only output and input prices as
explanatory variables in the formal definition of supply functions is a matter of con-</p>

</p>
<p>venience. There are, of course, other causal mechanisms that are likely to influence
individual and, therefore, market supply. Expectations, as already discussed, are
one example, but there are other influences as well. For example, a natural disaster
may destroy part of the production capacity, which cannot be offset in the short run
(supply shifts leftward), good weather conditions may increase the crop (supply
shifts rightward), or technological progress may lead to an increase in output per
unit of input (supply shifts rightward).
</p>
<p>The same arguments can, of course, also be made for the demand side,
which implies that a complete analytical description of demand and supply func-
tions should include all those other factors. Call these explanatory variables
˛; ˇ; &#13;; : : : and suppose that all customers have identical budgets b. Market sup-
ply and demand for good i could then be written as yi .pi ; r; w; ˛; ˇ; &#13;; : : :/ and
xi.p1; : : :; pn; b; ˛; ˇ; &#13;; : : :/. Specifying the most interesting causal mechanisms,
therefore, depends on the specific problem.
</p>
<p>With these concepts in the back of one&rsquo;s mind, one is now ready to move on and
see how demand and supply are coordinated on a competitive market.
</p>
<p>4.3 Equilibrium
</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about how it is possible that the baker knows that you will
buy a bagel when you go to the city? When you enter his store, the bagel is just
there, ready for you to buy and eat it. How come? How could the baker have
known, even though you never ordered the bagel in advance? If this example seems
a little bit underwhelming, to put it mildly, then one had better think twice. The
great miracle of the market mechanism is that millions and billions of people are
making decisions in an apparently uncoordinated, decentralized way and, despite
this fact, there is a great deal of order in market outcomes. How is this possible?
</p>
<p>Well, the first hint is that decisions are, of course, not uncoordinated. They
are coordinated by market prices that shape individual incentives to buy and sell
(and, more generally, to act), so decisions in a market economy are decentralized,
but not uncoordinated. The question then becomes: to what extent are prices able
to coordinate individual behavior and what does this imply for the functioning of
markets?
</p>
<p>Economists put ✍a lot of emphasis on the idea of equilibrium. To motivate a
formal definition, look at the following example: assume that, at a given market
price, demand exceeds supply, i.e. customers want to buy more than suppliers are
willing to sell. A situation like this has an in-built tension, because some customers
have to go home unsatisfied: the decentralized plans of the economic agents are
mutually inconsistent. (One reaches the same conclusion in the opposite case of
excessive supply.) Therefore, the only situation where all the plans of the economic
agents are compatible is at a price where supply equals demand. This situation is
called an equilibrium. It can be defined for the whole economy with n different
goods and associated markets (general equilibrium), or for a single market for good
i , leaving the rest of the economy out of the picture (partial equilibrium). For</p>

</p>
<p>Graphically speaking, a partial or general equilibrium is reached at the point
where the supply curve intersects the demand curve, as represented in Fig. 4.9.
</p>
<p>As this chapter has explained, equilibrium implies mutual consistency of plans
and has, therefore, the status of a local property. However, the question is whether
it is a good requirement from an empirical point of view. In other words, the ques-
tion is whether or not &ldquo;real&rdquo; markets tend to be in equilibrium. This is a question
about the dynamic forces that would act on the variables, if the system were not in
equilibrium. Economists usually have two epistemic views on that problem.
</p>
<p>Some would argue that equilibrium is nothing more than the requirement of
logical consistency, which implies that markets cannot be out of equilibrium, by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Equilibrium 71
</p>
<p>definition. When one empirically tests these theories, one can only observe equilib-
rium points. The rest of supply and demand curves are empirically non-accessible.
Others have an epistemically less rigid approach and interpret the idea of equilib-
rium more metaphorically, admitting that markets can be out of equilibrium in the
above sense. Equilibrium analysis, in this case, must be complemented by a model
that explains the adjustment of prices out of equilibrium. Otherwise, the concept
would be analytically arbitrary. This is usually done by the formulation of the fol-
lowing conjecture:
</p>
<p>I Assumption 4.1, &ldquo;Law&rdquo; of supply anddemand The prices of goods adjust in a way
that supply becomes equal to demand.
</p>
<p>One may have noticed that there is a tension in the way the &ldquo;law&rdquo; of supply and
demand is introduced. It has the status of an assumption but, at the same time,
it looks like a property of markets that can either be true or false and that could,
in principle, be empirically tested. Intuitively, it makes perfect sense that excess
demand will have the tendency to drive prices up and excess supply will have the
tendency to drive prices down, but mainstream economics is still lacking a full-sized
theory that explains out-of-equilibrium behavior in this sense and, at the same time,
it unambiguously supports the &ldquo;law.&rdquo; The conceptual problem is nicely summarized
by the following quote from Kirman (1992): &ldquo;Economists have no adequate model
of how individuals and firms adjust prices in a competitive model. If all participants
are price-takers by definition, then the actor who adjusts prices to eliminate excess
demand is not specified.&rdquo; In other words, the invisible hand of the market has to
belong to someone and this someone is absent in standard theory. Therefore, the
standard theory is static in nature, and the epistemically most convincing position
is to bite the bullet and interpret equilibrium as a logical constraint of the model.
</p>
<p>Why are economists interested in a general equilibrium? There are at least five
reasons that one should briefly discuss.
</p>
<p>� As mentioned before, ✍economists are concerned about the existence of an equi-
librium, because its existence implies that &ldquo;the invisible hand of the market&rdquo;
can guide individual decisions in a way that makes them mutually consistent.
The modern treatment of the existence problem and general equilibrium the-
ory, in general, goes back to L&eacute;on Walras, a French economist from the nine-
teenth century. His idea, from today&rsquo;s perspective, was of striking simplicity:
the equilibrium condition for each market, i , is characterized by the equation
yi .p
</p>
<p>�
i ; r; w/ D xi .p�1 ; : : :; p�n ; b/, or xi .p�1 ; : : :; p�n ; b/ � yi .p�i ; r; w/ D 0, for
</p>
<p>every good or service i D 1; : : :n. Thus, the problem of the existence of a general
(partial) equilibrium boils down to characterizing the conditions under which a
system of n (1) equation(s) with n unknown variables &ndash; the prices &ndash; has a so-
lution. Nearly a hundred years later, in the beginning of the 20th century, there
were still uncertainties as to whether or not such an equilibrium exists under cir-
cumstances that are sufficiently general to be representative of real-world supply
and demand decision. One of the major achievements of the so-called general-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72 4 Supply and Demand Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>equilibrium theory is the clarification of these conditions. Digging deeper into
the problem would be far beyond the scope of an introductory textbook, but the
general consensus is that the conditions that are sufficient to guarantee its exis-
tence are relatively mild. Thus, I give a statement of this property without proof:
</p>
<p>I Result 4.1, Existence theorem A general (partial) equilibrium exists under quite
general assumptions.
</p>
<p>This statement, of one of the most fundamental results of general-equilibrium
theory that has been used, is rather loose, so it makes sense to work on under-
standing this result by means of an example: assume there is only one market
with one price, so that the equilibrium condition boils down to z.p�; b; r; w/ D
x.p�; b/ � y.p�; r; w/ D 0. This function is called the excess-demand func-
tion and the equilibrium is the root of this function. Intuition dictates that this
function would tend to be positive, if the price approaches zero, because a lot
of people would like to buy, but only few are willing to sell. By the same to-
ken, this function tends to be negative, if the price approaches infinity, because
no one can afford to buy the good, but it is very attractive to sell. (Making
this conjecture precise requires a lot of work, but this is the insight of intu-
ition in a nutshell.) If one knows the properties of the excess-demand function
for very low and very high prices, the intermediate-value theorem tells one that
the function has at least one root, if it is continuous, because continuity makes
sure that it cannot &ldquo;jump&rdquo; above or below zero. Does it make sense to assume
that the excess-demand function is continuous? Continuity implies that demand
and supply change only a little bit for small price changes. One&rsquo;s demand for
apricots does not &ldquo;jump,&rdquo; if apricots become a little bit more expensive. This
assumption also seems pretty reasonable, but whether it holds true or not is ulti-
mately a question of preferences and production technologies. The art and craft
of general-equilibrium theory is to work out conditions based on preferences and
technologies that make sure that demand and supply are continuous. If they are,
a generalization of the intermediate-value theorem confirms that an equilibrium
exists. Interested readers can find more details in graduate-level textbooks on
advanced Microeconomics.
</p>
<p>� A related question is the uniqueness of an equilibrium.✍ It is an important prop-
erty of any positive theory to make unique and testable predictions. If there
are Multiple equilibria, then the predictive power of the theory is rather limited.
Unfortunately, it turns out that the assumptions that are necessary to guarantee
uniqueness are much stronger than the assumptions that are necessary to guar-
antee existence.
</p>
<p>� Coming back to the✍ epistemic question of the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; interpretation of the ex-
istence property, a lot of economists consider stability a desirable property of an
equilibrium. Stability refers to the property of a system to return to its initial
state after a shock has occurred. Assume, for example, that an economy is not
in equilibrium initially. Are there forces at work that will lead the economy to-
wards the equilibrium? The answer is similar to the case of uniqueness: only
under strong assumptions.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.4 EquilibriumAnalysis 73
</p>
<p>� The problems of uniqueness and stability are also relevant for the predictive
power of the model. Assume, for a moment, that the model of competitive mar-
kets is a good description of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; economy and that it is used to inform
oneself and political decision makers about the likely effects of policy reforms
like changes in taxes, integration of markets, and so on. As covered before,
comparative-static analysis is the analysis and comparison of equilibria for dif-
ferent states of the explanatory variables like, for example, the equilibrium with
high and low income taxes. In order to be able to learn something meaningful
about real-world policies, uniqueness and stability are, in fact, crucial. Without
uniqueness, it would be very hard to predict the outcome of policy reforms and,
without stability, one could not be sure that the &ldquo;new&rdquo; equilibrium would ever be
reached.
</p>
<p>� The basic normative question that results from the theory of comparative advan-
tage is how to design institutions (like competitive markets) to make sure that the
gains from trade that are, in principle, possible from specialization and trade can
actually be realized. This is the question about economic efficiency: are com-
petitive markets capable of inducing incentives such that the problem of scarcity
is alleviated to the largest extent possible, given technological and resource con-
straints? Chapter 5 will be devoted to an in-depth analysis of this question.
</p>
<p>� Last, but not least, ✍one could be interested in questions of economic justice, in
the following sense: assume that there are two individuals, Ann and Bill, who
can specialize and trade according to the theory of comparative advantage. Let
the monetary value of the gains from trade that is made possible by this process
be CHF 100 (which will henceforth be called rents). The fact that markets are,
in principle, able to make sure that these gains from trade can, in fact, material-
ize does not tell one anything about their distribution. They could, in principle,
go exclusively to Ann, exclusively to Bill or could be shared. This raises the
question of distributive justice and if society has strong opinions about the dis-
tribution of these rents, there might be a tension between economic efficiency
and distributive justice.
</p>
<p>4.4 Equilibrium Analysis
</p>
<p>As one says, the proof of the pudding is in the eating so, the next step is to see
how useful the model of perfect competition is for gaining better understanding
of the economy. The most important comparative-static exercises for the supply
and demand side have already been covered. This subchapter will now put them
together to show how they can be used to develop one&rsquo;s intuition for the effects of
external shocks or economic policy. The case studies below are intended to give
one a basic idea of how to analyze economic problems by means of models. The
purpose is not to develop a complete picture, which would be a very demanding
task. Even the very simple model of demand and supply gives one a lot of mileage
in understanding complex social phenomena.</p>

<p>Fig. 4.10 Equilibrium in the market for green coffee
</p>
<p>Case study: How bad weather in Brazil affects the Swiss coffee market After
oil, coffee is the world&rsquo;s second most important commodity and Brazil is the world&rsquo;s
largest coffee producer. In the days before the so-called second and third waves of
coffee culture, coffee was essentially run down to a commodity of moderate quality
and low prices. Low quality implied that the customers had low willingness to pay,
and a low willingness to pay implied that farmers would have a low willingness to
invest in quality. Assume that there is a world market for green coffee and that the
situation in this market can be summarized by Fig. 4.10.
</p>
<p>The supply of green coffee is shown by the upward-sloping supply function
y.p/, which is determined by the coffee farmers from the different growing re-
gions. On that note, the downward-sloping function, x.p/, is the demand for green
coffee, which is determined by the coffee roasters, who buy green coffee, roast and
package it, and sell it directly to the consumer or to national retailers. Assume that
these supply and demand functions reflect the situation in an average year with av-
erage harvests. The equilibrium in this market is given by the intersection of the
supply and demand curves, which implies a market price of p� and a trade volume
of x�.
</p>
<p>Now, examine the effects of adverse weather conditions in a country, like Brazil,
that is responsible for about one third of the world supply of green coffee. These
weather conditions reduce the crop by a substantial amount compared to an average
year. The effect of this reduction in supply is illustrated in Fig. 4.11: the world</p>

<p>Fig. 4.11 The effect of a reduction in the crop on the equilibrium
</p>
<p>supply function for green coffee shifts leftward, because the quantity available at
any given price is now smaller than in an average year. The demand function is
unaffected by this change, because it is mainly determined by the demand function
of the final customers, which leverages onto the demand function of the roasters.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the total effect of the shift in the supply function is that the market
price for green coffee increases to p��, and the volume of trade drops to x��. What
are the implications of this change? At first glance, Brazilian coffee farmers are, of
course, negatively effected by the adverse weather conditions, because they suffer a
loss in their crop. However, they are at least partly compensated for this loss by the
increase in the market price which can even lead to higher revenues of the Brazilian
farmers.
</p>
<p>The following example illustrates this point: assume the demand for green coffee
is given by x.p/ D 1�p, and supply by y.p/ D aCp. a is a scaling parameter that
can be used to analyze the effect of changes on the crop. Smaller values of a shift
the supply function leftwards. These demand and supply functions lead to a market
equilibrium of p� D .1 � a/=2, x� D .1C a/=2. In addition, the total revenues R
of the coffee farmers are given by the total quantity of green coffee times the market
price, R D p� � x� D .1 � a2/=4. Assume that supply in an average year is given
by a D 1=2, which implies that p� D 1=4, x� D 3=4, and R D 3=16. The loss in
crop can be analyzed by a change in a from 1=2 to, say, 0. In this case, p� D 1=2,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>76 4 Supply and Demand Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>x� D 1=2, and R D 1=4 D 4=16 &gt; 3=16: total revenues go up, despite the fact that
farmers sell less coffee.
</p>
<p>It should✍ be noted that the positive effect of the adverse weather conditions on
the farmers&rsquo; revenues depends on the parameters of the model (please check for dif-
ferent values of a). It may also be the case that revenues go down, so it is ultimately
an empirical question as to whether a shortage in supply has positive or negative
effects on revenues. However, assume for a moment that the effects are positive,
because this nicely illustrates the nature of perfect competition. If revenues go up
and production costs do not overcompensate this effect, then profits should go up,
as well (I will come back to this point in Chap. 8, when I will be in a position to
determine profits explicitly). In that case, why do coffee farmers have to rely on bad
weather conditions to reduce their crop when they could reduce it voluntarily? Are
they irrational, too stupid to understand what is good for them, or is there something
more profound going on? The reason why every single farmer has no incentive to
reduce his crop is that he is too small to be able to influence the market price by a
reduction in crop size. Bad weather conditions, on the other hand, influence approx-
imately one third of the farmers, which has a substantial effect on the market. This
explains why prices go up. Therefore, even though each single coffee farmer acts
rationally, the total effect is that prices and revenues are low. This is an illustration
of the idea of unintended consequences, first brought forward by John Locke and
Adam Smith.
</p>
<p>Other coffee farmers, of course, profit from the increase in price, because their
crops are unaffected, so they are able to sell them at higher prices. The effect on
roasters is unclear at the moment, because it depends on whether they can pass
on the price increase to the retailers or final customers or not. On that note, one
can have a look at the downstream market for coffee and, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake,
assume that roasters sell directly to customers, bypassing retailers (this simplifying
assumption has no qualitative effect on our analysis). The market for roasted coffee
looks similar to the market for green coffee, but has a different interpretation. Figure
4.12 shows this market.
</p>
<p>The demand function, X.P / (I use capital letters to distinguish this downstream
market from the upstream market for green coffee), represents the demand for
roasted coffee by customers like students and professors. The supply function,
Y.P /, for coffee is determined by the coffee roasters. They buy green coffee on
the downstream market, which was analyzed before, and use it as an input to pro-
duce the different varieties of coffee that customers can find on the shelves. The
equilibrium in an average year is given by X� and P �. What is the effect of the
shortage of green coffee due to the Brazilian crop failure? The increase in the price
for green coffee raises the costs of the coffee roasters, which implies that their sup-
ply functions also move leftward. Thus, the situation is qualitatively similar to the
market for green coffee and is illustrated in Fig. 4.13.
</p>
<p>As before, the price for roasted coffee tends to go up to P �� and the quantity
sold tends to go down to X��. In a situation like this, the roasters are able to pass
on part of the increase in input prices to the customers, but only part of it, because
customers react to an increase in prices by a reduction in the quantity of coffee</p>

Brazil will ultimately affect Swiss coffee drinkers, because of the tight relationship
between the different markets.
</p>
<p>Case study: What makes financial markets special? In principle, it is possible
to use the same techniques to analyze the functioning of financial markets. There
are, however, a few peculiarities of the traded goods that make these markets special
and that create an inherent instability. For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, one can restrict one&rsquo;s
attention to equity markets, where shares of firms are traded and then start with a
representative, potential buyer of stocks. How does she determine her willingness
to pay? Contrary to consumer goods, like apples or shoes, shares are not directly
useful; people buy them because they want to make money and there are two ways
to make money with shares: the first source of income results from the future flow
of profits the share will bring to the shareholder, and the second results from a
difference between the future selling and the present buying price.
</p>
<p>If the flow of future profits were known, the price of a share should be equal to
the discounted cash flow (DCF). For example, assume that a share brings a profit of
CHF 100 a year from now, CHF 100 two years from now, and nothing from then on.
Assume further that she could invest her money in safe government bonds that give
her an annual return of 10%. In that case, she should use this interest rate to discount
the future profits, which leads to a DCF of 1=.1C0:1/1 �100C1=.1C0:1/2 �100 �
173:5. With uncertainty about future returns, the price would be reduced by a risk
premium. In such a world and with rational expectations, there could only be a
difference between discounted selling and buying prices, if unanticipated surprises
regarding the future value of the shares take place (for example, because of an
unanticipated invention).
</p>
<p>The problem with the DCF method is, of course, that no one in the market knows
the discounted cash flow for sure, which implies that no one knows if a share is
overvalued or undervalued at any given point in time. Take Apple Inc. as an exam-
ple: its DCF depends on the perceived ability to create &ldquo;the next big thing.&rdquo; This
ability depends on a large number of factors, from the current personnel, to the abil-
ity to attract creative employees in the future, and to the general corporate culture
and technological constraints and opportunities (the usefulness of devices, like the
Apple Watch, depends on the reliability of sensors that allow one to track certain
parameters of one&rsquo;s health, and it is unclear ex ante if and when the technology will
be marketable).
</p>
<p>The plethora of different factors that determine future profits make any assess-
ment of DCF risky. If all market participants had equal information, then trade
should only occur because of differences in attitudes towards risk. If all market
participants also had equal attitudes towards risk, the transactions should only take
place between those individuals with more optimistic and those with less optimistic
expectations.
</p>
<p>The market becomes inherently unstable, because expectations about future prof-
its may become self-fulfilling, if they can spread through the market and influence
buyers and sellers. Similarly to viruses that infect a population, rumors can spread
and influence the willingness to pay for shares. If market participants, for exam-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.4 EquilibriumAnalysis 79
</p>
<p>ple, lose their faith in the ability of Apple Inc. to deliver the next big thing, they
will reduce their DCF, which can cause a downward price spiral. If share prices go
down, however, the ability of a company to finance investments and research and
development can be severely impeded, which creates a situation where its ability
to create profits in the future is, in fact, reduced: the negative expectations become
self fulfilling, even if there was initially no reason for the more pessimistic view.
This is the key difference between the share price for Apple Inc. and the price for
apples.
</p>
<p>Case study: Markets as production technologies The theory of comparative ad-
vantage was covered in Chap. 2 and it is now time to come back to those basic ideas
to see how they relate to competitive markets. To recapitulate, the sequential inte-
gration of ever more trading partners increases the size of the cake, but may, at the
same time, produce losers who would be better off with a system of partial integra-
tion. The identity of winners and losers is determined by the institutional structure
of the economy. I will elaborate on this idea by focussing on policy interventions
on competitive markets. There is a striking formulation of the central thought un-
derlying the idea of comparative advantage that goes back to David Friedman. In
the words of Steven Landsburg (1995): &ldquo;There are two technologies for producing
automobiles in America. One is to manufacture them in Detroit, and the other is to
grow them in Iowa. Everybody knows about the first technology; let me tell you
about the second. First, you plant seeds, which are the raw material from which
automobiles are constructed. You wait a few months until wheat appears. Then you
harvest the wheat, load it onto ships, and send the ships eastward into the Pacific
Ocean. After a few months, the ships reappear with Toyotas on them. International
trade is nothing but a form of technology. The fact that there is a place called Japan,
with people and factories, is quite irrelevant to Americans&rsquo; well-being. To analyze
trade policies, we might as well assume that Japan is a giant machine with myste-
rious inner workings that convert wheat into cars. Any policy designed to favor the
first American technology over the second is a policy designed to favor American
auto producers in Detroit over American auto producers in Iowa. A tax or a ban on
&lsquo;imported&rsquo; automobiles is a tax or a ban on Iowa-grown automobiles. If you protect
Detroit carmakers from competition, then you must damage Iowa farmers, because
Iowa farmers are the competition.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>This way of thinking allows one to focus on the key aspects of policy interven-
tions in globalized markets. Markets for wheat and markets for cars are connected,
because individuals spend the money that they make with wheat for buying cars and
vice versa. The connection does not have to be direct, but may follow from a com-
plicated maze of interactions that, in the end, make both markets interdependent.
Wheat farmers may, for example, sell their harvests to bakeries, which produce and
sell bread and pay wages to their workers. The bakeries sell the bread to retailers,
who pay their workers, as well. Farmers and bakers use part of their wage income
to buy cars and thereby transform, via a complicated chain of events, wheat into
Toyotas. The really fascinating insight from this example is that policy interven-
tions in one industry may have &ndash; for the layperson &ndash; completely unanticipated side
effects on other industries. The above example shows that, at the end of the day,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>80 4 Supply and Demand Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>the complicated interplay between different markets makes Detroit-built cars and
Iowa-grown wheat substitutes. Economists, who are used to think in terms of mar-
ket interdependencies, can play a very important role in society by carving out these
effects.
</p>
<p>Here is another example✍ that this chapter does not fully work out, but that can
serve as food for thought. Switzerland is currently an immigration country and most
people are motivated to move to Switzerland, because of high wages. A couple of
years ago, some politicians and economists discussed the idea to skim off part of the
&lsquo;immigration rent&rsquo; by the introduction of an immigration tax that has to be paid by
the immigrant workers. This may sound like a good idea, however, are we aiming at
the right target? In order to understand this question, assume that the labor market
for internationally mobile workers is competitive. In this case, immigration will
take place up until the point at which workers are indifferent between working in
different countries, in the long run. This is called an arbitrage condition. The
introduction of an immigration tax does not change this logic: arbitrage between
labor markets makes sure that the tax-induced reduction of net incomes of mobile
workers will be compensated by an increase in gross income, up until the point
where the marginal immigrant is again indifferent between working in Switzerland
and working abroad. Therefore, the immigration tax cannot skim off rents from
mobile workers, because the market reacts in such a way as to compensate them
for the tax. Then again, all immigrant workers pay the tax and the state generates
revenues.
</p>
<p>Hence, there seems to be a puzzle: who pays the immigration tax, in the end? To
answer this question one has to analyze the connections between different markets
and the most promising candidate is the housing market: immigrants have to live
somewhere, so one can expect that immigration would tend to increase rents and the
overall price level on the housing market. (A side effect is that immigration triggers
a redistribution from Swiss renters to landlords, because rents tend to increase for
both Swiss and foreign renters.) What one can conclude is that at least part of the
immigration tax is passed on to property owners. Given that an arbitrage condition
holds in labor markets for internationally mobile workers, in the long run, it is the
group of property owners who profit from immigration, because of the increased
values of their property, and it is the same group that, in the end, has to bear the
better part of the immigration tax. The phenomenon that the groups that are legally
responsible for paying taxes and the groups that, in fact, pay it do not have to coin-
cide is called tax incidence in economics and it is, again, one of the most important
duties of an economist to create an awareness of the real effects of policy decisions.
</p>
<p>Case study: The likely consequences of autonomous vehicles A more specu-
lative example is to tinker with the likely effects of self driving cars, which is no
longer exclusively Google&rsquo;s hobby horse. Companies like Mercedes Benz or Volvo
have invested a lot of resources into this new technology, and an economic analysis
reveals why this is the case. This case study will combine the insights gained from
the concepts of both opportunity costs and competitive markets in order to speculate
about the economic and social implications of this technological innovation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.4 EquilibriumAnalysis 81
</p>
<p>It is tempting to think about autonomous vehicles (AVs) in terms of increased
convenience, creating the appearance that it is just another innovation. The reality
will, however, be quite different, because the new technology will have massive
ramifications for cities, insurance markets, labor markets and the way one thinks
about mobility.
</p>
<p>To begin with, if cars can move around autonomously, then why should they be
idle most of the day? It may make much more sense to let a car pick one up and drop
one off at work before it continues on to transport someone else. The reason why
this option opens up with AVs is a change in opportunity costs. With the current
technology, mobility is bound to a human driver, so the opportunity costs of letting
one&rsquo;s car transport other people during one&rsquo;s office hours is the wage rate of the car
driver (this is the Taxi or Uber model). These opportunity costs drop to essentially
zero as soon as the new technology takes over, which makes it more costly (in terms
of opportunity costs) to leave a car idle.
</p>
<p>These changes will have four likely major consequences:
</p>
<p>� They will likely cause a change in ownership structures, because it becomes
more and more attractive for an individual user to borrow usership rights than
to own a vehicle, because the transaction costs of organizing vehicle sharing are
likely smaller with large, specialized sharing companies (that may but do not
have to be the car manufacturers themselves; Zipcar, Car2Go and Mobility are
good examples). Additionally, one may observe the emergence of new sharing
models that do not exist today. People will not stop buying cars altogether, be-
cause they might still enjoy the act of driving or the flexibility of owning a car,
but the opportunity costs of these aspects of individual ownership will increase,
implying that fewer cars will be owned.
More fundamentally, with AVs forming a large part of transportation, commuting
could be thought of as an interlinked system of complementary transport carriers
that, together, form a seamless network of mobility opportunities. AVs will be
moving through the streets and people will hop on and off as needed. For long-
distance rides, AVs will pick one up at home, drop one off at the train station or
airport, and another AV will pick one up at the final destination. As a result, the
divide between private and public transportation will get blurred.
</p>
<p>� If total mobility remains stable, a better utilization of the existing fleet frees
up parking space in cities (AVs can park more consistently and closer together
humans do now and they can park outside of the city center), which changes the
appearance and functioning of cities, leaving more room for pedestrians, but also
freeing up valuable properties for better uses than parking space.
</p>
<p>� However, if consumers develop from owners of cars to users of mobility ser-
vices, the functioning of the insurance industry will change, as well. Today, it
is mostly a highly regulated business-to-customer market where each individual
car driver or car owner is required to insure against accidents. In the future, it
will transform into a business-to-business market where insurance companies in-
sure the providers of mobility services. This move is also inevitable, because the
main sources for accidents will change from human error to technology failures.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82 4 Supply and Demand Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>In addition, experts assess that the new technology will be safer than the existing
one. McKinsey predicts a 90% drop in accidents, implying annual savings on
repair and health-care bills of up to $190 billion in the US alone. This will save
lives and drastically reduce insurance premiums.
</p>
<p>� The incentives to rethink ownership structures will also likely change the way
individuals think about cars and mobility. Cars have been a very important status
symbol for the better part of the 20th century. Changes in opportunity costs make
this status symbol increasingly costly and maybe even ridiculous in the eyes of
a majority of people.
</p>
<p>However, AVs will also influence productivity and labor markets. They will, for
example, fundamentally reform the logistics industry. The current complementarity
between vehicles and human drivers will be replaced by substitution competition
between man and machine. The short-run consequence will be downward pressure
on wages in these sectors and the long-run consequence will be massive job losses.
</p>
<p>Regarding productivity and leisure time, the time spent commuting might not go
down but people, freed from the need to drive, can spend their commute working,
consuming media or being in contact with friends. These changes will provide
opportunities for other industries, for example by creating an in-car media market.
</p>
<p>The above examples illustrate the usefulness of the model of perfect competition
for an understanding of the functioning and interdependence of markets. They have
been exercises in what has been called positive economics. A natural question at
this point may be if markets are able to coordinate economic activities in a way
that is desirable from a normative point of view. The next chapter is devoted to
answering this question.

<p>The analysis of the coffee market in the last chapter showed how the model of per-
fect competition can be used to better understand economic phenomena. This has
been an exercise in what economists call positive economics, which is a very im-
portant aspect of economics, as a social science. However, most people are not
only interested in the logic of social interaction, but also in normative questions
about desirable properties of institutions like markets. Economists, like other social
scientists, are not experts in justifying specific, normative criteria, but what they
can do is to analyze if or to what extent certain institutions make one&rsquo;s ideas about
justice and fairness a reality. There is a division of labor between economists, prac-
tical philosophers and the general public in the discourse about the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to

<p>84 5 Normative Economics
</p>
<p>organize society. The general public has certain (culturally influenced) viewpoints
and gut feelings about justice that are scrutinized and systematically analyzed by
practical philosophers, and some of these theories are put to the test by economists,
who try to figure out how institutions have to be designed to help promote the nor-
mative goals of the individual members of society. Under ideal circumstances, this
process can lead to a fruitful discourse between philosophers, economists and the
general public, because the coherence of one&rsquo;s ethical gut feelings with the implied
institutional consequences can thereby become visible and may lead to a process of
adjustments in one&rsquo;s ethical views as well as one&rsquo;s ideas of just institutions. John
Rawls (1971), a philosopher, called such a state of balance among ethical intuitions
and institutions, which is reached through a process of deliberative mutual adjust-
ment among general principles and particular judgments, a reflective equilibrium.
</p>
<p>The outlined✍ picture of the division of labor is, maybe, a little bit too optimistic,
in the sense that mainstream economics is overwhelmingly concerned with a spe-
cific class of normative theories, which are called welfarism. Welfaristic theories
of just institutions start from the normative premise that individual welfare, and
only individual welfare, should matter for an evaluation of institutions. Individ-
ual welfare is measured in terms of the (subjective) wellbeing (often called utility)
the individuals experience (or are supposed to experience) in a specific institutional
context. Welfarism is a subclass of a larger class of normative theories that is called
consequentialism. All consequentialist theories of justice share the view that the
consequences of acts are all that matters for normative evaluations. This property
has far-reaching implications for the way one perceives the role of institutions: they
are basically incentive mechanisms that have to guarantee that individual behavior
leads to the socially most desired outcomes. Institutions are like irrigation systems:
the flow of water follows the laws of gravity so, to make sure that a garden flour-
ishes, one has to dig the channels in the right way. The same is true for society:
individuals follow their interests so, to make sure that individual and social inter-
ests are aligned, one has to make sure that individual interests are &ldquo;channeled&rdquo; in
the right way, by means of adequately designed institutions.
</p>
<p>In looking✍ at the big picture, consequentialism itself is only one of three major
classes of normative theories that are debated in practical philosophy, the other two
being deontology and virtue ethics. Deontological theories assert that consequences
are irrelevant for the normative evaluation of acts, but rather the focus belongs on
certain properties of the procedure, which lead to decisions. A prominent represen-
tative of this way of thinking is Immanuel Kant, who famously claimed that good
will is the only analysis that counts for the normative evaluation of acts, though
there are many more. This view puts much more emphasis on individual moral re-
sponsibility and less on institutions. It states that the primary entity that makes sure
that individuals behave morally is the law of reason, not the law of the state. The
role of formal institutions is, therefore, secondary.
</p>
<p>Another classical proponent for a completely different deontological concept of
justice is John Locke, who argued that humans have absolute natural rights. Rights
are not assigned because they serve a higher purpose (they are means), but because
they are an integral part of what it means to be human (they are ends). According to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.1 Introduction 85
</p>
<p>this view, natural rights are not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any
particular culture or government, and therefore are universal and inalienable. They
are life, liberty, and property. However, if property is a natural right of every human
being, then markets get a direct, normative underpinning, because liberty, private
property and markets go hand in hand. Disciples of the natural-rights tradition do
not support markets because they have desirable consequences, but because they
respect property and liberty.
</p>
<p>Virtue ethics goes all the way back to at least Aristotle and is a theory that sees
the main challenge a human being faces in the quest to perfect his or her virtues.
Very similar ideas can be found, in for example, Confucianism and Buddhism. The
virtuous moral person, like the virtuosic violin player, acts morally effortlessly,
because she trained herself to make it her &ldquo;second nature.&rdquo; The virtuous person
does not act morally in the sense of Kant, because she does not act out of a sense of
duty. If a person performs an act, it is because she is inclined to act this way, due to
it it &ldquo;feeling natural&rdquo; to the virtuous person, Kant calls this act beautiful, not moral.
</p>
<p>The virtuous person acts in accordance with his or her moral duties, which again
changes the view one has on the role of institutions. Contrary to Kant, who puts a lot
of trust in the ability of reason to control individuals, institutions play an important
role in virtue ethics, because good institutions help individuals to become (morally)
virtuous. The good state, according to this view, is the state that helps its citizens
become virtuous: &ldquo;We become just by the practice of just actions, self-controlled
by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage. [. . . ]
Lawgivers make the citizens good by inculcating [good] habits in them, and this is
the aim of every lawgiver; if he does not succeed in doing that, his legislation is
a failure. It is in this that a good constitution differs from a bad one.&rdquo; (Aristotle,
Ethics 1103a30)
</p>
<p>There is also ✍a decisive difference between virtue ethics and consequentialism
regarding the role of institutions, which can be traced back to Machiavelli. He
wrote that &ldquo;anyone who would order the laws [. . . ] must assume that all men are
wicked [. . . ] it is said that hunger and poverty make them industrious, laws make
them good.&rdquo; (Machiavelli 1984, 69&ndash;70). The task of government for Machiavelli,
was not to make citizens moral, but to make them act as if they were (Adam Smith&rsquo;s
invisible hand that leverages self-interest onto social welfare lurks in the door). In-
stitutions, in this sense, are incentive mechanisms and this view made its way via
Mandeville and Hobbes into modern consequentialism, with far-reaching conse-
quences for people&rsquo;s ideas about the role of institutions and the balance between
individual responsibility, autonomy and the state. A state, whose main purpose is
to make selfish people behave as if they were not selfish, is a different state from
the one that helps people to develop, for example, the virtue of justice. Both ideas
about the role of institutions start from different anthropologies and it is unclear
which one describes a human being more adequately.
</p>
<p>Mainstream economics has mostly, if not exclusively, focused on welfaristic the-
ories of just institutions and is, in this respect, normative. Insofar as it is not tailored
to the specificities of consequentialism, the toolbox could, in principle, be used to
analyze the implications of other ethical views, but this is not done in practice.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>86 5 Normative Economics
</p>
<p>Economists&rsquo; self-perception✍ is that they are no experts in normative theories and
that they, therefore, focus on what could be seen as a minimum criterion for a
just society: the criterion of Pareto efficiency. The idea goes back to the Italian
economist Vilfredo Pareto. He wanted to understand under which conditions insti-
tutions are able to cope with the problem of scarcity in order to avoid waste. Waste,
in this sense, is not the peel of a carrot, but a specific property of the allocation of
goods, services and resources. An allocation is a technical term for the distribu-
tion of resources, goods and services among the individuals in a society. The basic
idea is that this allocation would be wasteful, if it were possible to redistribute the
available goods and resources in a way that makes at least one individual better
off without making any other individual worse off. This type of wastefulness will
henceforth be called inefficiency, and an allocation that avoids waste will be called
efficient.
</p>
<p>The idea of efficiency sounds rather intuitive: an allocation cannot be just in the
welfaristic sense, if it is possible to make some people better off without harming
others. Therefore, efficiency is, in a sense, a necessary condition for a just allocation
of goods and resources. The question as to whether this is sufficient or not will be
the topic of later discussion.
</p>
<p>In order to make this idea more precise, one can split the production and con-
sumption of goods and services into two classes of activities: production, given
resource constraints, and consumption, given constraints on the available goods
and services (scarcity).
</p>
<p>I Definition 5.1, Efficiency in production An allocation of given quantities of re-
sources is efficient in production, if it is not possible to reallocate the resources
among the producers in such a way as to increase the production of at least one
good without reducing the production of some other good.
</p>
<p>I Definition 5.2, Efficiency in consumption An allocation of given quantities of
goods and services is efficient in consumption, if it is not possible to reallocate the
goods and services among the consumers in such a way as to increase the well-being
of at least one consumer without reducing the well-being of another consumer.
</p>
<p>I Definition 5.3, Pareto efficiency An allocation of given quantities of resources,
goods and services is Pareto-efficient, if it is efficient in production and consump-
tion.
</p>
<p>It is straightforward✍ to extend the above definitions to the concept of a Pareto
improvement: comparing allocations A and B , if no one is worse off and at least one
person is strictly better off in A than in B , then A is said to Pareto-improveB . (Note
that two Pareto-efficient allocations can never Pareto-improve each other, but it is
not true that a move from an allocation that is not Pareto-efficient to an allocation
that is Pareto-efficient is always a Pareto improvement. Assume, for example, that
allocation A gives 30 apples to individual i and 30 apples to individual j , allocation
B gives 80 apples to individual i and 20 apples to individual j , and allocation C</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.2 Normative Properties of Competitive Markets 87
</p>
<p>gives 40 apples to individual i and 40 apples to individual j . The individuals prefer
more apples to fewer apples. A is not Pareto efficient, because it is dominated by C ,
but both, B and C are Pareto efficient. Moving from A to B implies a change from
a Pareto inefficient to a Pareto efficient allocation, but it is no Pareto improvement,
because j is worse off.)
</p>
<p>The concept of Pareto efficiency has some intuitive appeal as a normative princi-
ple, but has nevertheless been criticized even by adherents of welfarism. The reason
is that Pareto efficiency is &ldquo;blind&rdquo; with respect to the distribution of economic rents.
Assume that Ann and Bill prefer more money to less money and try to distribute
CHF 100 in a Pareto-efficient way. It is straightforward to see that any distribution
of the money among the two is Pareto-efficient: the only way to make one person
better off is by taking money away from the other person, which makes this per-
son worse off. Thus, Pareto-efficient allocations may easily be at odds with one&rsquo;s
ethical intuitions about just or fair distributions of goods and services.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is hard to deny that a plausible normative theory (among the
welfaristic ones) would not qualify a Pareto improvement as a general improvement
in the well-being of society: if it is possible to improve the lot of at least one person
without harming any other, why should one not move in this direction? As long as
one is not malevolent, it is hard to justify arguments against Pareto improvements.
To summarize, if one considers welfarism to be a convincing class of normative
theories, then seeking Pareto improvements is necessary, but may not be sufficient
for justice.
</p>
<p>5.2 Normative Properties of Competitive Markets
</p>
<p>The definition of Pareto efficiency is very general and relies on a concept of in-
dividual wellbeing that this textbook has not formally introduced so far. While
motivating individual and market demand, Chapter 4 made a vague point that it
has something to do with individual preferences that we will formally introduce in
Chap. 5. In order to see if one can say anything about the efficiency of equilib-
ria on competitive markets, one has to derive a proximate measure for efficiency.
Fortunately, this can be done.
</p>
<p>In order to see how to do this, it makes sense to focus on a special example of
a market, a market for some good in which the demand of a single customer is
typically either zero or one, like refrigerators. The analysis is completely general,
though, and extends to all products. Figure 5.1 shows the demand function on the
market for fridges.
</p>
<p>Each point along the demand function can be associated with a specific indi-
vidual in society and the individuals are ranked according to their willingness to
pay for a fridge. This interpretation allows for a very powerful interpretation of the
points along the demand function: they give us the customers&rsquo; maximum willing-
ness to pay. Look at the individual who is &ldquo;behind&rdquo; the first unit of the good. The
market-demand function at this point signals a willingness to pay that is equal to
CHF 2,000. How does one know? By analyzing the response of this customer to</p>

<p>different prices. If the market price is below CHF 2,000, the customer is willing to
buy, if it is above, she prefers to not buy. Thus, CHF 2,000 is the critical price of
the good where the customer is indifferent between buying and not buying, hence it
is her willingness to pay.
</p>
<p>Assume that the price✍ of the good is equal to CHF 1,200. In that case, the
customer will buy one unit of the product. Is it possible to infer anything about the
customer&rsquo;s increase in well-being? Under a certain condition that will have to be
scrutinized below, yes, because her willingness to pay would have been CHF 2,000
and she pays only CHF 1,200, so a monetary measure for her increase in well-
being is CHF 2,000�CHF 1,200 D CHF 800. The same logic can be applied to all
customers, whose willingness to pay exceeds the market price. (All other customers
are neither better nor worse off, because they do not buy the good.) Therefore,
the aggregate monetary surplus is given by the added differences between one&rsquo;s
maximum willingness to pay and one&rsquo;s actual payment. It is equal to the triangular
area ABC in Fig. 5.1. This area is called the consumer surplus.
</p>
<p>In order to define this measure formally, one has to make use of the concept of
an inverse function. Remember that a function, f , is a mapping from one set A to
some other set B that links elements from A with elements from B , so f W A ! B .
Assume that the mapping is one-to-one such that, for every element a in A there is
exactly one element b in B that is connected with the element in A by f , b D f .a/
and vice versa. The function, f , answers the question as to which elements in B</p>

<p>are associated with the elements in A. One can also ask the opposite question: take
an arbitrary element of B ; which element of A is associated with it? Given that
the mapping is on-to-one, the answer is given by the inverse function that is usually
denoted by f �1 and which is a mapping from B to A.
</p>
<p>I Definition 5.4, Consumer surplus Given a market demand function for some
good i , xi .pi /, and a market price pi , let Pi.x/ be the inverse demand function
and define as x.pi / the demand where the price equals the willingness to pay. The
consumer surplus is the aggregate difference between the customers&rsquo; willingness to
pay and their actual payment,

<p>One can develop a similar argument for the supply side. Figure 5.2 gives one the
supply function for refrigerators.
</p>
<p>Assume, for simplicity, that each seller sells either one or no fridge. Then, each
point along the supply function can be associated with a specific seller in society
and the sellers are ordered according to the minimum price they want to receive
in order to be willing to sell the fridge. In order to understand why, look again at
the firm that is &ldquo;behind&rdquo; the first unit of the good. The market supply function at</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>90 5 Normative Economics
</p>
<p>this point signals a minimum price that is equal to CHF 100. How does one know?
Again, by analyzing the response of this firm to different prices. If the market price
is below CHF 100, the firm prefers not to sell the good; if the price exceeds CHF
100, it is willing to sell. CHF 100 is the critical price where the firm is indifferent
between selling and keeping the good, hence it is its willingness to sell (which is
also sometimes called the reservation price). Formally, this price is equal to a point
on the inverse of the supply function. Assume that the price of the good is equal to
CHF 1,000. In this case, the firm will sell one unit of the product. This increases its
(monetary measure of) well-being by CHF 1,000 � CHF 100 D CHF 900.
</p>
<p>Again, the aggregate monetary✍ surplus of all firms that sell at a given market
price is given by the added differences between market price and willingness to
sell. It is equal to the triangular area ABC in Fig. 5.2. This area is called producer
surplus.
</p>
<p>I Definition 5.5, Producer surplus Given a market supply function for some good
i , yi .pi /, and a market price pi , let Qi.y/ be the inverse supply function and define
as y.pi / the supply where the price equals the willingness to sell. The producer sur-
plus is the aggregate difference between the market price and the firms&rsquo; willingness
to sell,
</p>
<p>PS.y.pi // D
y.pi /Z
</p>
<p>yD0
</p>
<p>.pi �Qi.y//dy:
</p>
<p>Combining supply and demand in the same figure, one can now calculate a mea-
sure for the aggregate rent on this market, see Fig. 5.3.
</p>
<p>What one can see in this figure is the sum of consumer and producer surpluses
as the total area between the supply and demand function up to the equilibrium
quantity x�. This sum of consumer and producer surpluses is a measure for the
gains from trade that are made possible by this market.
</p>
<p>How do the concepts of consumer and producer surplus relate to the concept of
Pareto efficiency? If one identifies the willingness to pay and the willingness to
sell as expressed on the market with the individual&rsquo;s &ldquo;true&rdquo; willingness to pay and
sell, then one can identify the allocation that maximizes the sum of consumer and
producer surplus with a Pareto-efficient allocation: the only way to make sellers
better off is by increasing prices, which makes customers worse off, and vice versa.
By the same token, selling more than the equilibrium quantity requires both a price
below the market price, to induce a buyer to buy, and a price above the market price,
to induce a seller to sell, which boils down to saying that one would destroy rents.
This observation is one of the most profound findings of the theory of competitive
markets and, therefore, has a very prominent name.

</p>
<p>The First Theorem of Welfare Economics is a strong result in support of com-
petitive markets, because it implies that markets have a tendency to avoid socially
wasteful activities. Under conditions of scarcity, when people would always prefer
a larger slice of the cake, competitive markets make sure that the cake is as large as
it can be, given the available resources. This is why many economists have a lot of
confidence in market economies and competition.
</p>
<p>It gets even better. The previous subchapter explained that Pareto efficiency is
only a necessary but, for many people, not a sufficient criterion for distributive jus-
tice, because the resulting allocation may be highly unequal. Can one say anything
about the distribution of welfare? The so-called Second Theorem of Welfare Eco-
nomics gives a clue.
</p>
<p>I Result 5.2, Second TheoremofWelfare Economics Assume there are endowments
of goods and resources, and that demand and supply fulfill certain conditions of
regularity. Then, every Pareto-efficient allocation can be reached as a competitive
equilibrium by means of reallocating the endowments.
</p>
<p>Again, the statement of this result is not very precise, but it is sufficient for work-
ing on the economic reasoning underlying the theorem. Building this reasoning is
important, because the theorem became very influential for the way economists
think about redistribution. For simplicity, assume that one looks at an economy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92 5 Normative Economics
</p>
<p>without production, where individuals are endowed with certain goods. They can
decide to consume their endowments (autarky), or they may enter the market and
trade their endowment for some other goods. For example, Ann and Bill are en-
dowed with apples and pears and can try to do better than what they can expect
from their endowments, by trading apples for pears with each other. The total en-
dowment of apples and pears is 10 and 10, and both want to consume as many
apples as pears. Assume that Ann has all the apples and pears in her endowment
and Bill has nothing, so the endowments are eA D .10; 10/ and eB D .0; 0/. In
this case, there is nothing to trade and the allocation is Pareto-efficient, but highly
unequal. Next, assume that the endowments are eA D .2; 8/ and eB D .8; 2/. In
this case, it makes sense to trade and a plausible candidate would be to trade three
apples for three pears, allowing Ann and Bill a consumption of five apples and five
pears each. This trade would lead to a market price of apples in terms of pears that
is equal to 1 (one gets one apple for one pear), and the resulting allocation is the
egalitarian one.
</p>
<p>Now, assume that one is a social planner or politician, who is leaning towards
egalitarian outcomes, and one is confronted with initial endowments eA D .10; 10/
and eB D .0; 0/. The Second Theorem of Welfare Economics tells one what to do:
in order to reach a more egalitarian outcome, one should redistribute the endow-
ments of the individuals in roughly the desired direction and let the market do the
rest. Therefore, if a social planner, &ldquo;the state&rdquo;, or politicians have sufficient coer-
cive power to administer this type of redistribution, then there is no tension between
efficiency and equity.
</p>
<p>One should devote some more effort to deeply understanding the meaning of the
welfare theorems. A modern economy is an unbelievably complex social arrange-
ment, where millions and billions of decisions are made every day. Each decision
has a tiny influence on the way goods and resources are distributed among individ-
uals. If I decide to spend CHF 150 for a new pair of sneakers, I am revealing that
the pair of sneakers are worth more to me than their price and, at the same time,
they must be worth less to the producer, because the purchase is voluntary. Thus,
trading the sneakers is efficiency-enhancing. On that note, if there are people who
are willing to sell sneakers at the given market price, they will enter the market.
Given that this process only stops when the willingness to pay of the &ldquo;last&rdquo; buyer
equals the willingness to sell of the &ldquo;last&rdquo; seller, markets are Pareto-efficient and
goods and resources are directed towards their most efficient uses. There is no cen-
tralized planner with information about the willingness to buy and sell of billions of
individuals to get to this point: the only thing that is needed is that individuals have
information about the prices that are relevant for them.
</p>
<p>At the same time, I am revealing that CHF 150 for a pair of sneakers is worth
more to me than any other alternative use of the money, including saving the money
for my future (concept of opportunity costs). This creates a link between the market
for sneakers and all other markets. This complicated network of markets makes sure
that signals about relative scarcity are transmitted in a way that guides resources
towards their most efficient uses. If, for example, a technological innovation in
the IT sector (for example a new accounting software) creates a substitute for a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.2 Normative Properties of Competitive Markets 93
</p>
<p>traditional job, like an accountant, which has capital costs lower than the wage rate,
then firms will start replacing accountants with software. If software is cheaper to
use, it reduces the costs of production, which reduces the firm&rsquo;s willingness to sell.
For given market prices, profits increase, but the firm will ultimately be pressured
on market prices, because high profits will encourage market entry. Hence, the
technological innovation influences the price of the goods that are produced with
this technology and makes them relatively cheaper compared to other goods. This
effect, again, redirects consumer behavior: if the good is ordinary, consumers will
buy more of the cheaper goods, increase consumption of their complements, and
reduce consumption of their substitutes, which has effects on these markets, as
well. Therefore, the effect of a relatively local technological change will ultimately
be spread over the whole economy, leading to adjustments in all kinds of markets.
</p>
<p>How about the accountant? The technological innovation created a substitute
for his job, making him compete with a new technology. The only way for the
accountant to keep his job is to be willing to reduce his wage to the point where
the employer is indifferent between using the new computer software and human
labor. In this sense, wage rates also signal relative scarcity: the emergence of new
technologies makes this specific type of labor less scarce, leading to lower prices
(wages). In the long run, this reduction in wages is an important signal, because
it discourages people from becoming accountants, making labor available for more
valuable uses. Thus, wage rates are also an important signal of scarcity that support
individuals in their decisions to qualify for certain jobs. However, this knowledge
may be of little help for a fifty-year old accountant with two young kids and a
mortgage to pay, who becomes unemployed.
</p>
<p>Should one trust the theorems of welfare economics? There are three points that
should be mentioned before one can reach a conclusion:
</p>
<p>� The reason why there is no tension between efficiency and equality in the ex-
ample is that redistributing exogenous endowments has no adverse incentives
for the individuals. The amount of ingredients that are available for baking the
cake do not depend on the initial property rights of the ingredients. If this were
the case, redistribution might have adverse incentive effects. For example, if the
state levies an income tax, people are likely to be discouraged from working.
In this case, there is a tension between efficiency and equity, because moving
into the direction of more egalitarian outcomes shrinks the pie. Therefore, the
policy advice that follows from the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics is to
look for &ldquo;tax bases&rdquo; that do not react to redistributive policies. However, such
tax bases are rather limited. The only ones that come to mind are land plus the
natural resources in the ground (but, even in this case, the willingness to extract
them may depend on the tax system), potential ability of the people, like IQ (but
there is a lot of evidence that IQ is, to a certain extent, a function of effort),
or the individual himself (which is called a head tax). All other tax bases may
react to changes in redistributive policies. Hence, the range of applicability of
the theorem, in its pure form, is rather narrow, but the general insight is very
important: if one wants to minimize the efficiency costs of egalitarian policies,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>94 5 Normative Economics
</p>
<p>one should try to identify tax bases that are as independent as possible from the
redistributive policies.
</p>
<p>� In order to be able to impose and enforce redistributive policies that are in line
with the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics, the agency that is in charge
needs sufficient independence and sufficient coercive power to be able to enforce
the policies. Independence: coming back to the apple-pear example, it is likely
that the endowment-rich Ann will oppose redistributive policies and she has at
least two channels to be effective in this respect. First, she can try to influence the
agency&rsquo;s decisions, for example by lobbying. Putting politicians on the payroll
of the rich is a very effective way to prevent even worse redistributive policies
(from the point of view of the rich). Therefore, the quality of political institutions
becomes important in determining whether redistributive policies can be imple-
mented or not, if one cannot rely on the intrinsic motivation of the politicians
and bureaucrats to execute them. Coercive power: a second problem, which has
to do with the quality of political institutions, is the ability of the agency that
is responsible for redistributive policies to actually enforce them. Ann, for ex-
ample, could try to shield her fortune by complicated tax-avoidance strategies,
trusts, etc. If the agency has only limited means to enforce its policies, then it
has to rely on the voluntary cooperation of the &ldquo;rich.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>� The third point worth mentioning is more methodological. In the apple-pear
example, the &ldquo;state&rdquo; would like to enforce the egalitarian solution .5; 5/; .5; 5/.
However, if this is the case, why do they choose the detour .2; 8/; .8; 2/ and rely
on markets, instead of choosing the desired allocation directly? Looking at the
problem from this angle shows that the second theorem is, of course, correct, but
it does not provide us with a strong argument in favor of competitive markets,
because it is unclear why markets are needed in the first place.
</p>
<p>5.3 Is One&rsquo;sWillingness to Pay One&rsquo;s Willingness to Pay?
</p>
<p>The argument about the efficiency of market equilibria relies heavily on a rather
innocuous-looking, implicit assumption about the relationship between the willing-
ness to pay and the &ldquo;true&rdquo; willingness to pay of individuals. Research, which has
been primarily conducted by so-called &ldquo;behavioral&rdquo; economists, neuroscientists and
psychologists has increasingly scrutinized whether one can always identify the ex-
pressed willingness to pay or sell with the &ldquo;true&rdquo; willingness to pay or sell.
</p>
<p>The identification✍ of both is an example of what economists call the theory
of revealed preference, which makes the point that the true, normatively relevant
preferences of a person can be elicited from his or her (market) behavior. This con-
jecture has strong implications for the normative evaluation of individual choices,
because it implies that individuals make no mistakes when they choose among dif-
ferent alternatives. This does not mean that they never regret their choices, but that
any regret is a necessary consequence of resolved uncertainty: I caught a virus dur-
ing my trip to a foreign country so, ex-post, I would have preferred to have stayed</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>5.3 Willingness to pay 95
</p>
<p>at home. However, ex-ante, before the trip, and given my subjective assessment of
the risks, it was still the right decision.
</p>
<p>Whether or not the observed willingness to pay is a reliable measure for the
actual preferences of the individuals is a highly controversial and disputed question,
because much is potentially at stake. If one assumes that people sometimes do not
know what is best for them, then the door is wide open for paternalistic interventions
that undermine individual freedoms. However, at the same time, not interfering with
individual freedoms implies that those who understand those weaknesses and design
products and pricing strategies to their advantage can exploit systematic weaknesses
in the ability to make correct decisions. I will come back to this point in Chap. 10
when discussing pricing strategies.
</p>
<p>A comprehensive overview of so-called behavioral biases, which point towards
a gap between the actual and the revealed interests of people, would be far beyond
the scope of this book, but this subchapter will use two examples to illustrate the
point:
</p>
<p>� There is a lot of experimental evidence that decisions can depend on apparently
arbitrary &ldquo;anchors.&rdquo; Anchoring describes a process from behavioural economics,
based on which one can influence people&rsquo;s estimates with arbitrarily suggested
associations &ndash; even if the association, the so-called anchor, is completely un-
related. For example, if one asks people whether Gandhi was older than 114
when he died and then ask them for his age of dying, one will get higher esti-
mates then if one asks whether he was older than 35. In a famous experiment,
researchers demonstrated how arbitrary and irrelevant information can influence
the willingness to pay. MBA students could buy a bottle of wine. In a first step,
they were asked if they would be willing to pay an amount that equals the last
two digits of their social-security number. In a second step, they were asked how
much they would actually be willing to pay for the bottle of wine. According
to standard theory, the social security number should have no influence on their
willingnesses to pay for the wine. In practice, however, it turned out that stu-
dents with a social-security number that ended with a number below 50 were
willing to pay significantly less than those whose social-security number ended
with a number above 50. The average willingness to pay in the former group
was �11.62, whereas the other group was willing to pay �19.95, on average.
Bringing the social-security number to mind makes it an anchor from which the
subjects develop their estimates. It implies that completely irrelevant informa-
tion can influence one&rsquo;s willingness to pay, even for relatively ordinary products
like wine, which challenges the idea of revealed preference, because decisions
to buy or sell are likely highly context dependent and the specificities of the con-
text that will determine decisions are hard to anticipate. People are especially
prone to anchoring effects when they make financial decisions and it can explain
a number of marketing strategies like arbitrary rationing: customers will, on av-
erage, buy more items in sales promotions if one sets a (high) limit than if one
sets no limit at all.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>96 5 Normative Economics
</p>
<p>� Another effect is called ego depletion. A number of studies have shown that peo-
ple who are confronted with a challenging cognitive task and a temptation (like
eating chocolate) are more likely to give in to the temptation than people are
who do not have to solve the cognitive task. The term ego depletion reflects the
fact that the cognitive task exhausts important aspects of the personality: mo-
tivation and self-control. Ego depletion has a lot of behavioral consequences,
from aggressive responses to status-oriented behavior. However, from the point
of view of willingness to pay, the most interesting consequences are the follow-
ing: people with depleted egos are more prone to overspending and impulsive
purchases (people, for example, are more prone to impulsive purchases after a
long day of work, which partly explains why some companies concentrate inter-
net adds during this part of the day), and they have a harder time abiding their
diet. Therefore, economic decisions, which are made with a depleted ego, will
likely be regretted and one cannot infer the &ldquo;true&rdquo; preferences from the observed
behavior.
</p>
<p>What are the areas where it is very likely that individuals do not consistently act
according to their true interests? Loewenstein, Haisley and Mostafa (2008) give
an overview: &ldquo;There are areas of life [. . . ] in which people seem to display less
than perfect rationality. For example, although the United States is one of the most
prosperous nations in the world, with a large fraction of its population closing in
on retirement, the net savings rate is close to zero and the average household has
$8,400 worth of credit card debt. Fifty percent of U.S. households do not own any
equities, but the average man, woman and child in the U.S. lost $284 gambling in
2004, close to $85 billion in total. Many workers don&rsquo;t max out&rsquo; on 401k plans
despite company matches (effectively leaving free money &lsquo;on the table&rsquo;) and what
they do invest often goes undiversified into their own company&rsquo;s stocks or into fixed
income investments with low long-term yields. At lower levels of income, many
individuals and families sacrifice 10&ndash;15 percent of their paycheck each month to
payday loans, acquire goods through rent-to-own establishments that charge effec-
tive interests rates in the hundreds of percent, or spend large sums on lottery tickets
that return less than fifty cents on the dollar. Worldwide, obesity rates are high and
rising rapidly, and along with them levels of diabetes and other diseases, and peo-
ple with, or at risk for, life-threatening health conditions often fail to take the most
rudimentary steps to protect themselves.&rdquo;

<p>If one takes this list at face value, a pattern becomes visible: the decisions that
require a minimum degree of financial literacy, far-sightedness and commitment
seem to be the ones where people struggle the most. Maybe our evolutionary past
did not shape our brains in a way that makes it easy for us to handle these problems,
because they have not been very relevant for the better part of the history of our
species.

<p>If one agrees that there are economic decisions where it is uncertain whether
an individual is acting according to his or her well-understood interests, then the
revealed-preference paradigm is hard to defend and, if one cannot defend it, then

up in the air. This assessment does not imply that competitive markets are not
efficient, if the revealed-preference paradigm cannot be defended in a substantial
number of market contexts. What it implies, however, is that one cannot build one&rsquo;s
understanding of Pareto efficiency on the welfare theorems.

</p>
<p>Theorem of Welfare Economics). This finding has potentially far-reaching conse-
quences for one&rsquo;s perception of the economic role of institutions and, especially, of
the state: if competitive markets can alleviate scarcity efficiently, and if efficiency is
a convincing normative ideal, then the role of the state is restricted to that of a night
watchman. The night-watchman state is a metaphor from libertarian political phi-
losophy that refers to a state whose only legitimate function is the enforcement of
property rights and contracts and whose only legitimate institutions are, therefore,
the military, police, and courts.
</p>
<p>This concept of a state, whose monopoly on violence is restricted to the enforce-
ment of property rights and contracts, is sometimes also called a minimum state.
According to this view, a state that extends its functions beyond this role needs a
different normative legitimization by, for example, including distributive objectives.
However, even in this case, the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics guides di-
rections of government intervention: distributive objects can best be achieved by
redistributing exogenous endowments and, if they are not subject to redistribution,
one should look for the closest substitutes.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to scrutinize this narrative by extracting the im-
plicit assumptions underlying the claims about competitive markets. The idea is to
put the conclusions into perspective in order to allow one to better understand the
reasons for the efficiency of competitive markets, as well as their potential and their
limitations in the organization of economic activities. In summary, there are three
qualitatively different lines of reasoning suggesting that the First Theorem of Wel-
fare Economics cannot be the final say in the debate about the best way to organize
economic activities:
</p>
<p>� The first line of reasoning has already been mentioned in the last chapter: ir-
respective of the functioning of the price mechanism, it is unclear whether the
revealed-preference paradigm is adequate for all types of goods and services.
</p>
<p>� The second point that one has been able to tackle, is the relationship between the
mode of production in a given industry, summarized by the production technol-
ogy, and the viable market structures. Not all market structures are compatible
with all technological modes of production, but there is a close link between
the two. For example, perfect competition requires a specific production tech-
nology to be sustainable. I only briefly mention this point in this chapter, for
completeness, but will dive into the details in Chap. 8.
</p>
<p>� Last, but not least, there can be contractual limits to the establishment of markets,
and these limits will be the focus for now. As I argued in the last chapter, any
exchange of goods and services has two dimensions: a real one that focuses on
the physical aspects and a legal one that focuses on the transfer of rights. This is
why the majority of arguments, which will be developed below, are also relevant
in legal contexts and, in fact, law and economics as an interdisciplinary field of
research evolved along some of the lines demonstrated here.
</p>
<p>I will start with some observations that should puzzle one if one looks at them
from the perspective of the First Theorem of Welfare Economics.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.1 Introduction 101
</p>
<p>First, the welfare theorems provide only necessary, but not sufficient, arguments
for a night-watchman state, because one has not looked for the efficiency-properties
of alternate solutions yet. It may be that, under the conditions of the welfare theo-
rems, other organizational structures would also turn out to be efficient. As I will
show in later chapters, both monopolistic and oligopolistic markets can turn out to
be Pareto-efficient as well, and one does not have any a priori reason to assume that
centralized planning is not efficient, even though the big historical experiment in
centralized planning called socialism can, in all fairness, be called a failure. How-
ever, maybe a comparison between &ldquo;capitalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; is too bold and
ideologically charged to allow for a constructive view on institutions. A strong and
complete argument in favor of markets has to close this gap.
</p>
<p>Second, there L, Bis a big theory-reality gap that one has to approach. Assume that
the First Theorem of Welfare Economics is a correct characterization of competi-
tive markets, for all types of goods and services. What one should expect, in this
case, is a strong tendency of real economies to evolve into the direction of perfect
competition, because such an organization would outcompete others. What would
such an economy look like? Every transaction would take place in markets and, for
example, corporations and other institutional entities would not exist. The assembly
of, for example, cars would be organized by a complex chain of bilateral contracts
between all the persons who contribute to the manufacturing of the car and the cus-
tomers. Everyone would act as &ldquo;You Inc.&rsquo;s&rdquo; on atomistic markets without any firms
as hierarchical organizations, which replace the market place by a system of hierar-
chical command and control mechanisms. However, this is not what we observe.
</p>
<p>A lot of economic activities are revoked from markets and are, instead, organized
according to the different logic of corporations. Basically, what happens if a firm
hires a worker is that the worker accepts, within a certain scope, to comply with the
instructions of one&rsquo;s principal, which is a hierarchical and not a market interaction.
The first step into the corporation is of course a market transaction (signing the
job contract), but it is exactly with this contract that one agrees to simply follow
the orders of one&rsquo;s boss without further negotiations about prices and so on. A
firm can be interpreted as an institution that replaces markets with hierarchies. Yet
how could this ever be beneficial, if a market is a reliable instrument for achieving
Pareto-efficiency? Taking the First Theorem of Welfare Economics at face value,
firms should not exist. But they do. Here are two potential reasons why: first,
because people are not sufficiently smart to figure out how efficient markets are, so
they make mistakes by withdrawing so many transactions from the market place;
second, there is something missing in the theory.
</p>
<p>One can also turn the question on its head: if one infers, from the existence of
firms, that there must be good reasons (in efficiency terms) for their existence, why
does one not organize all economic activities within a firm? Why does one organize
some transactions with the use of markets? This question has been baptized the
&ldquo;Williamson puzzle&rdquo; after one of the founding fathers of contract theory and the
theory of the firm, Oliver Williamson. Here is the idea: if one has a set of transac-
tions that are organized on markets, one could just as well organize them under the
roof of one big firm. If markets are efficient, the manager leaves everything as it</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>102 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>is, so the performance of the firm must be equal to the performance of the market.
However, if the market is, for some reason, inefficient, then the manager can correct
this inefficiency by a centralized, selective intervention. Hence, the firm should be
able to outperform the market. However, if one thinks about it, this one big firm,
which is organizing all economic activities under its roof, comes close to a system
of centralized planning. Thus, again, the puzzle shows that there must be something
missing in the theory thus far.
</p>
<p>Additionally, to further increase the confusion, why do some firms replace the
market mechanism for a set of transactions and then hurry to imitate its functioning
in mimicking its mechanisms internally by, for example, the introduction of cost
and profit centers, where the inter-center transfer of goods and services is organized
by centrally administered transfer prices?
</p>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs
</p>
<p>There is a plethora of different institutions in modern economies: markets, profit-
oriented firms, non-profit organizations and government agencies. These are all
responsible for the mediation of the production and distribution of goods and ser-
vices, all with their own distinctive logic for providing and distributing goods and
services. Any economic theory that aims to understand the reasons for the existence
and boundaries of these different ways, in order to organize economic activity, must
go beyond the First and Second Theorem of Welfare Economics.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenge is to identify the missing idea that explains institutional
diversity. In order to do so, it makes sense to look at the logic of the First Theorem
of Welfare Economics from a different perspective. This allows one to reach a
deeper understanding of the reasons why markets can be efficient, but also points
towards possible explanations for the limitations of markets.
</p>
<p>On a very basic level,✍ scarcity implies that individual acts and consequences are
interdependent. My decision to drink this glass of wine implies that no one else can
drink it. My decision to wear a blue sweater implies (a) that no one else can wear
this sweater at the same time and (b) that everyone passing along my way has to see
me wearing it. In a world without scarcity, acts would be independent from each
other and, therefore, individual goals would not compete with each other. There-
fore, what scarcity does is to make individual acts interdependent. As a result, my
decisions have repercussions on some other peoples&rsquo; well-being and the question
is whether I take these consequences into consideration when I make a decision.
Efficiency, from this perspective, requires exactly this: that each and every person
takes the effects of his or her decisions on others into consideration and behaves
accordingly. The technical term is that the person internalizes the effects of his or
her behavior on others.
</p>
<p>However, if I am selfish or ignorant, or both, then I do not care about the effects
of my behavior on others. This is the point where markets step in: if I own a car
and I consider driving it myself, I am also aware of the fact that I could alternatively
sell it on the market. What I am doing in this situation is comparing the monetary</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 103
</p>
<p>value of using the car myself with the market price. If the market price is higher, I
want to sell my car; otherwise, I prefer to use it myself.
</p>
<p>What does this almost trivial observation have to do with other people? Remem-
ber what one has found out about equilibrium prices thus far. The market price in a
competitive market is equal to the willingness to pay of the consumer, who is just
indifferent between buying and not buying. Thus, prices reflect the willingness to
pay of other market participants: my ability to sell the good makes me implicitly
internalize the effects that my choices have on others, with the consequence that I
only use the good if my willingness to pay exceeds the willingness to pay of other
potential users. This is the deeper meaning behind Adam Smith&rsquo;s famous remark on
self-interest mediated by the market: &ldquo;It is not from the benevolence of the butcher,
the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their
own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and
never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.&rdquo; The self-love of
the baker leverages onto one&rsquo;s well-being, because one pays him to do so. Prices,
in this respect, have two very powerful functions in an economy: they motivate the
selfish to care about the effects of their actions upon others, and they also help the
benevolent, because prices considerably reduce complexity.
</p>
<p>6.2.1 An Example
</p>
<p>Assume a firm produces some good (bread) by means of capital and labor. The
capital (oven) is debt-financed and labor (the baker&rsquo;s time) is employed. This eco-
nomic activity has three effects. First, the bread makes those people eating it better
off (it is crispy, tasty bread). Second, it ties capital to the specific use, which has
opportunity costs in the sense that it cannot be used elsewhere. Third, the baker
spends some time baking bread, which also has opportunity costs either in the form
of forgone alternative earnings or in the form of forgone leisure time. With com-
petitive markets for capital, labor, and goods, there will be market prices for both
inputs and the output. The owner of the bakery has to decide how much bread to
bake, how much to invest in capital, and how much labor to hire. The price for
bread signals the social value of an additional loaf of bread, which implies that
he correctly internalizes the additional welfare that he creates with his bread. The
price for capital (the interest rate) signals the opportunity costs of the next-best use
of capital, which implies that the owner correctly internalizes the &ldquo;damage&rdquo; that he
creates by detracting capital from alternative uses. Additionally, the price for labor
(wage) signals the opportunity costs of labor, i.e. the loss in welfare that results
because the baker cannot do anything else during the time he is baking bread. This
example illustrates not only that decisions are interdependent, but also that markets
make sure that they are made in an efficiency-enhancing way.
</p>
<p>So far, so good, but one still is not at the point where it becomes apparent how
markets are not efficient. In order to reach this point, I will modify the above
example. In the first modification, the production of the product now has sewage as
a necessary byproduct, which is dumped into a nearby lake. This reduces the profit</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>104 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>of a fisherman. Can one still count on markets doing their magic and leading the
economy towards efficiency? The answer is that it depends, and this is where the
legal side of the problem enters the picture. There are three possible scenarios:
</p>
<p>1. The firm has the legal right to dump sewage.
2. The fisherman has the legal right to prohibit the dumping of sewage.
3. The existence and allocation of rights is unclear.
</p>
<p>The first and second cases are qualitatively identical to the first example: property
rights are completely assigned, which is a prerequisite for bilateral negotiations be-
tween the firm and the fisherman. Assume that the reduction of sewage by 10%
reduces the profits of the firm by CHF 1000 and increases the profits of the fisher-
man by CHF 1500. In this case, there are gains from trade between the fisherman
and the firm, and the fisherman can buy &ldquo;sewage-abatement rights&rdquo; from the firm,
in case the firm owns the rights. Any price for a 10% reduction between CHF 1000
and CHF 1500 increases the profits of both, the firm and the fisherman, and it is
a priori not clear why negotiations should not be successful. However, the same
holds true if the fisherman is the initial owner of the rights. In this case, the firm
can buy &ldquo;sewage rights&rdquo; from the fisherman. There is no reason to assume that one
assignment of rights is better than the other, from the point of view of efficiency
but, of course, both scenarios lead to different distributions of economic rents, be-
cause the owner of the right gets paid. This is no different from the case of, for
example, apples: ownership rights, of course, have a value, but they are irrelevant
with respect to the efficiency of the resulting allocation.
</p>
<p>It is only case three where markets cannot do their magic. If there is no &ldquo;owner&rdquo;
of the lake, the fisherman and the firm can haggle until eternity without ever reach-
ing a legally binding agreement. Therefore, what one can take away from the
example is that markets can only be established if property rights are well defined.
These findings motivate the following definition:
</p>
<p>I Definition 6.1, externality✍ An institution is inefficient if not all interdependencies
caused by the individuals are internalized. These non-internalized interdependen-
cies are called externalities or external effects.
</p>
<p>Definition 6.1 is sufficiently✍ general to include non-market as well as market
institutions. In a market context, the institution is, for example, a system of com-
petitive markets and the internalization takes place by means of market prices. A
situation where externalities exist in a system of markets is sometimes also called
a market failure. If the institution is a firm, the internalization could take place by
means of internal transfer prices between divisions or by means of wage contracts
for employees. It is important to stress that the concept of external effects refers
to the institutional framework in which transactions take place; externalities are not
properties of goods and services per se.
</p>
<p>The above example has shown that incompletely specified property rights can
lead to externalities, because markets cannot emerge. This is an example of what is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 105
</p>
<p>called incomplete markets, and the key question is whether markets are necessarily
incomplete, because it is impossible to assign property rights, or if the problem can
be fixed by &ldquo;closing the gaps&rdquo; and assigning previously unassigned property rights.
</p>
<p>The narrative of the example has purposefully been developed around an envi-
ronmental problem, because many people think that there is something inherent in
environmental goods that prevents markets from being efficient. This is a profound
misunderstanding, as the example shows. The fact that the interdependency be-
tween the fisherman and the baker is caused by sewage is inconsequential for the
ability of markets to steer incentives efficiently; what is relevant is the existence
and enforcement of property rights and contracts. The same type of problem, as in
case 3, would occur if the property rights for bread were not assigned or unclear. If
everyone were to enter the bakery and take as much bread as he or she could, the
allocation of bread would likely be inefficient and the owner of the shop would lose
any incentive to continue production. Thus, why is it that, especially environmental
goods are prone to market inefficiencies? There are several reasons, but none of
them is causally linked to the &ldquo;environmental quality&rdquo; of a good or service. One
reason is that, for a long time in human history, a lot of environmental goods have
not been scarce. Fresh air and water became only scarce in a lot of areas over the
last century or so. However, without scarcity, it is not necessary to think about effi-
cient uses and there is, therefore, no need to assign property rights to these goods.
Thus, part of the problem is a lagging behind of the assignment of property rights
when scarcity finally kicks in. For the better part of human history, humans simply
did not have the technology to completely deplete fishing grounds, so there was no
need to regulate access, and the same goes for other natural resources. However,
these problems are relatively easy to solve because, in principle, one can assign
rights.
</p>
<p>In addition to incompletely assigned property rights, there is another reason why
markets may fail. Assume, in the above example, that property rights are completely
assigned, so that either the firm or the fisherman have the user rights for the lake.
Therefore, in principle, it should be possible to set up a contract that specifies the
quantity of sewage the firm is allowed to emit into the lake. The problem may then
be that the contracting parties are not able to verify if the other party sticks to the
terms of the contract. There may be emissions by the firm that cause a reduction in
the population of fish that is not easily detectable or even impossible to detect. In a
situation like this, setting up a contract that specifies emissions may be insufficient
to reaching efficiency because the contract cannot be enforced if neither party can
verify a potential breach of it (in front of a court, for example).
</p>
<p>However, there are other reasons Lwhy markets may fail. In order to get to this
point, consider a further variation of the example. In this case, the firm no longer
produces sewage that impedes with a single fisherman, but pollutes the air with
negative consequences for all the residents in the nearby city. Now, one can look
into what property rights and markets can do in this example.
</p>
<p>1. The firm has the right to emit.
2. The residents have the right to prohibit emissions.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>106 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>In the first case all the residents have to find an agreement with the firm. However,
given that there are a lot of them, reaching such an agreement is likely to be very
costly (think of the opportunity costs of time the residents and firm representatives
have in reaching an agreement). Thus, it is very likely that negotiations will break
down. The same is also true, if the residents hold the rights. Here is a numerical
example: assume, as before, that the reduction of pollution by 10% reduces the
profits of the firm by CHF 1000 and has a monetary value for each of the 10,000
residents of CHF 2. So there are huge gains from trade (CHF 20,000�CHF 1000 D
CHF 19,000), but each resident is only willing to negotiate up to the point where
his or her opportunity costs of time are smaller than CHF 2, which is if they take no
longer than, say, five minutes.
</p>
<p>These opportunity costs are an example for a type of costs that turned out to be
the key for understanding the economic role of institutions:
</p>
<p>I Definition 6.2, transaction costs✍ Transaction costs are the costs of economic ac-
tivity that are caused by the institutional framework.
</p>
<p>Transaction costs are, therefore, the costs of organizing economic activities, of
measuring and policing property rights, of lobbying and rent seeking, or of moni-
toring performance, to mention a few potential sources.
</p>
<p>One can check if the above-mentioned type of opportunity costs prevents suc-
cessful negotiations. Assume that mutual negotiations take longer than five minutes
for each resident. In this case, the potential gains from trade are more than con-
sumed by the transaction costs of negotiations (the transaction costs of five minutes
of negotiations are CHF 2 times 10,000 residents D CHF 20,000), so it is very
unlikely that negotiations will be successful and, even if they are, they create a
negative net value.
</p>
<p>The fact that markets will likely lead to inefficient outcomes is not an argument
against markets per se. The question is if alternative institutions exist that econ-
omize on transaction costs. In the above case, the residents could, for example,
delegate the authority to negotiate with the firm to a single representative. Even
if some residents have to accept a compromise in the negotiations because of their
very specific preferences, this compromise may be better than the externalities that
would result from decentralized negotiations. To be more specific, assume that the
opportunity costs of reaching an agreement to delegate authority to a representative
are CHF 1 per resident, and that the subsequent negotiations between the repre-
sentative incurs additional opportunity costs of CHF 1000 but reach an efficient
agreement. In order to calculate the &ldquo;net&rdquo; gains from trade one has to subtract the
sum of transaction costs from the gains from trade, i.e. CHF 20,000� CHF 1000�
CHF 10,000 D CHF 9000. In this case, delegating authority consumes part of the
gains from trade, but dominates the decentralized market outcome, because it re-
duces the transaction costs. Note that the resulting arrangement can no longer be
described as a decentralized market mechanism, but more closely resembles what
might be called &ldquo;representative democracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 107
</p>
<p>Digression 11. Class Action L
A class action is an element of the U.S. legal system that allows a group to
sue another party. It is a way to overcome the collective-action problem that
exists, if many people are harmed by the actions of one party. The problem,
in cases like these, is often that the small recoveries that can be expected by
any individual do not provide an incentive to sue individually, despite the fact
that the aggregate recoveries may be very high. Such a situation creates an
incentive for parties to take disproportionately high risks, because the likeli-
hood that they will be brought to court in case of harm is inefficiently small
without class action. This problem leads to externalities.
</p>
<p>Class action is a means to internalize these externalities. This argument
has been explicitly used by the United States Court of Appeals. In Mace
v. Van Ru Credit Corporation (1997), the court argued that &ldquo;[t]he policy at
the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that
small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a
solo action prosecuting his or her rights. A class action solves this problem
by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth
someone&rsquo;s (usually an attorney&rsquo;s) labor.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>This point is also stated in the preamble to the Class Action Fairness Act
of 2005: &ldquo;Class-action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal
system when they permit the fair and efficient resolution of legitimate claims
of numerous parties by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single
action against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Swiss law, on the contrary, does not allow for class action. When the gov-
ernment proposed a new Federal Code of Civil Procedure in 2006, replacing
the cantonal codes of civil procedure, it rejected the introduction of class ac-
tions. In the message to Parliament on the Swiss Code of Civil Procedure
(Federal Journal 2006, p. 7221) it has been argued that &ldquo;[it] is alien to Eu-
ropean legal thought to allow somebody to exercise rights on the behalf of a
large number of people if these do not participate as parties in the action.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>6.2.2 Analysis of Externalities onMarkets
</p>
<p>Externalities in markets can easily be analyzed using the supply and demand di-
agram that was introduced in Chap. 4. One describes the demand function as a
function that measures the customers&rsquo; willingness to pay, and the supply function
as a function that measures the producers&rsquo; willingness to sell. If interdependencies
between individuals remain uninternalized, there is a gap between the individual
and the social valuations of economic transactions, implying that individual de-
mand and supply do not adequately reflect the social value of the transaction. Take
the emissions problem from above as an example and assume that the residents do</p>

<p>not figure out ways to organize collective action. In this case, markets are incom-
plete, because a market for emissions does not come into existence. If one wants
to analyze this problem using standard supply and demand diagrams one, therefore,
has to focus on the market for bread, which is given in Fig. 6.1.
</p>
<p>The figure shows the demand and supply of bread in this economy, with an equi-
librium quantity x� and equilibrium price p�. Focus on the case where the baker
pays for pollution first. One knows, from the above reasoning, that there must be
a difference between the baker&rsquo;s willingness to sell, if he does not have to pay for
pollution, and the willingness to pay, in case he has to pay. If pollution is propor-
tional to the quantity of bread, the supply curve with internalized interdependencies
must be above the supply curve with uninternalized interdependencies. Making the
baker pay for pollution increases his opportunity costs of production, which should
influence his willingness to sell any given quantity of bread. Production becomes
more expensive, so his willingness to sell should be higher than with uninternalized
interdependencies. This situation is given in Fig. 6.2.
</p>
<p>Given that the upward-shifted supply curve has been derived for the hypothetical
case of complete markets, where the baker has to pay for pollution, it reflects the
true social opportunity costs of bread production. Hence, the intersection between
the demand curve and the &ldquo;truncated&rdquo; supply curve (point O in Fig. 6.2) represents
the Pareto-efficient solution, and one sees that uninternalized interdependencies
lead to inefficiently high levels of production at disproportionately cheap prices:</p>

<p>too much for too little. A situation like this is also called a negative externality in
production.
</p>
<p>Digression 12. Externalities, L, ˆ&ldquo;Polluter-Pays Principle,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Principle of Mini-
mumHarm&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In environmental law, the &ldquo;polluter-pays principle&rdquo; makes the party respon-
sible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage. It has
support from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) and European Community countries and it seems to make a lot of
sense intuitively: in the above example, the baker is responsible for the pol-
lution of the lake, so why not making him pay for cleaning up his mess?
</p>
<p>Before one rushes to this conclusion, however, it makes sense to hold on
for a second. It is correct to say that the baker causes the pollution, but this
does not mean that he also causes the externality. This claim seems odd at
first and it is one of the many counterintuitive insights from Ronald Coase
to stress that externalities, necessarily, involve more than a single party. The
externality exists only because both, the baker and the fisherman, are located
on the same lake. If one of them would move away, the externality would</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>110 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>cease to exist. In other words, externalities must be treated as a reciprocal
problem. The polluter-pays principle ignores the fact that externalities are
jointly caused by all involved parties: to avoid harm to a pollutee necessarily
inflicts harm on the polluter.
</p>
<p>If one is still not convinced, because it is the baker who pollutes the lake,
think about a situation where a dynasty of bakers has been living at the lake
for generations. Then, from one day to the other, a fisher decides to settle
and set up his business. A few days later, he starts complaining about the
pollution. Is it still so obvious that the baker causes the externality?
</p>
<p>The polluter-pays principle is one way to assign rights, because it implies
that one party, and not the other has to pay and, with adequately set pay-
ments, the externality gets internalized. One has, however, also seen that the
same type of solution can be reached if the baker has the right to pollute and
the fisherman pays for reductions in pollution. Such a &ldquo;pollutee-pays princi-
ple&rdquo; may be at odds with one&rsquo;s intuitions of fairness but, from an efficiency
point of view, one has no reason to assume that it is better or worse than the
polluter-pays principle. If one sticks with efficiency as a normative principle,
it makes sense to replace the principle with a &ldquo;cheapest cost avoider princi-
ple.&rdquo; The idea behind this principle is that it cannot be assumed, in general,
that both assignments of rights are equally efficient. With differences in trans-
action costs, however, it makes sense to assign the rights in a transaction-costs
minimizing way.
</p>
<p>The above discussion was exclusively concerned with the normative crite-
rion of efficiency, which is an example of an anthropocentric ethic. The reason
why the normative problem of externalities vanishes, if the fisherman moves
away, is because there is no human being left to be harmed. Environmental
ethics like &ldquo;deep ecology&rdquo; make the point that such an ethic is too narrow,
because the lake, as an ecosystem, still gets harmed and the only way to solve
this problem is to reduce pollution. If one includes considerations like this,
the polluter-pays principle requires a different interpretation, because it is the
only one that respects the integrity of nature. From this perspective, it can
be seen as a special case of the more general principle of minimal harm or
ahimsa that is a fundamental moral position of Jainism, Hinduism, and Bud-
dhism. A very popular proponent of the principle of ahimsa was Mahatma
Gandhi, and it also shaped Albert Schweitzer&rsquo;s principle of &ldquo;reverence for
life.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>L As previously stated, there are always two ways of internalizing interdependen-
cies (that may differ in transaction costs), depending on which side of the market
holds the property rights. Therefore, the alternative in the example above would
be to analyze the effects on the bread market, if the residents pay the baker. Is the
effect on the bread market identical to the example above or can one expect some-
thing different? If the previous analysis is correct, then the assignment of property
rights should not influence the efficiency of the solution (without transaction costs),</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 111
</p>
<p>so both scenarios had better yield the same effects on the bread market. In order
to check this, assume that the baker gets paid for the reduction in emissions and
emissions are again proportional to bread production. For simplicity, assume that
one loaf of bread produces one unit of emissions. Let the price of bread be pb and
the price for each unit of omitted emissions be pe . In this case, an additional loaf
of bread has two effects on the baker: it increases his revenues by the market price
for bread, pb , and he reduces his revenues because of the additional emissions by
pe . The total effect on the baker&rsquo;s revenues is therefore pb � pe , whereas it had
been pb with uninternalized interdependencies. The effect of this change is that
the supply curve moves upwards as in Fig. 6.2: the only way to convince the baker
to sell as much bread as with uninternalized interdependencies is to pay him more.
This finding verifies the conjecture that, in the absence of transaction costs, it is
irrelevant which side of the market pays for the interdependency: it is only relevant
that one side does. This insight plays an important role in the literature on law and
economics that tries to understand the behavioral consequences of different legal
rules.
</p>
<p>If there are negative externalities in production, it should not be too surprising
that there can also be positive externalities in production, negative externalities in
consumption, and positive externalities in consumption:
</p>
<p>� Negative externality in production: The behavior of an individual causes non-
internalized interdependencies, the internalization of which would increase the
opportunity costs of production. An example is the above-mentioned problem of
uninternalized environmental interdependencies.
</p>
<p>� Positive externality in production: The behavior of a firm causes uninternal-
ized interdependencies, the internalization of which would reduce the opportu-
nity costs of production. An example is the pollination of fruit trees by bees.
The presence of a beekeeper in proximity of a fruit farmer increases the crop
of the farmer, because more blossoms get pollinated. If there is no market for
&ldquo;pollination services,&rdquo; the resulting equilibrium is inefficient with too few bees,
honey and fruits. Such a situation can, for example, be analyzed in the market for
honey, where the individual&rsquo;s willingness to pay falls short of the social value of
honey, because the quantity of honey is positively correlated with the pollination
services provided, for which the beekeeper is not paid. (This is an assumption
to illustrate how this type of interdependency can be analyzed using supply and
demand diagrams if, in fact, the interdependency causes an externality. In prac-
tice, farmers and beekeepers are likely to figure out ways to pay for the services).
Alternatively, one can focus on the fruit market, in which the individual&rsquo;s will-
ingness to sell is higher than the efficient one, because the same quantity of fruit
is more costly to produce, if there are not enough bees around.
</p>
<p>Digression 13. Pollination Services

<p>The first reaction of a lot of people when they first hear about pollination
services is to discard them as a slightly idiosyncratic curiosity, without much</p>

</p>
<p>economic relevance. The truth is that pollination services are the backbone of
agriculture and are also a very important economic factor.
</p>
<p>Pollination makes a very significant contribution to the agricultural pro-
duction of fruits, vegetables, fiber crops and nuts. Estimates show that
pollination services contribute between US $6 and US $14 billion to the US
economy per year (Southwick and Southwick, 1992; Morse and Calderone,
2000). The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimated that
pollination services are worth more than US $215 billion globally.
</p>
<p>Given the economic importance of pollination services, it should not come
as a surprise that commercial pollination services have emerged, mostly
provided by honeybees through a long-standing and well-organized market.
Californian Almonds are a good example to study the functioning of this mar-
ket. Almonds are one of the most profitable agricultural products. Recently,
honeybee pests and other problems have reduced available bee supplies. At
the same time, the high profit margins led to an expansion of almond acreage.
Standard supply-and-demand analysis predicts that this trend &ndash; shortage in
supply and increase in demand for pollination services &ndash; leads to an increase
in the price. Figure 6.3 shows that this has, in fact, been the case: the average
price per colony almost tripled between 1995 and 2006.
</p>
<p>Pollination services are an example of what is called an ecosystem func-
tion, which is defined as &ldquo;the capacity of the ecosystem to provide goods and
services that satisfy human needs, directly or indirectly&rdquo; (De Groot 1992).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 113
</p>
<p>These services are not only provided by bees, but by a wide variety of
insects, birds and mammals (like bats). A study for the UK found that insect-
pollinated crops have become increasingly important in UK crop agriculture
and, as of 2007, accounted for 20% of UK cropland value. Bees account
for only about 34% of pollination services, down from 70% in 1984 (Breeze,
Bailey, Balcombe, and Potts 2011). Unlike with bees, it is very difficult to
create markets for pollination services provided by other species, which leads
to externalities. One of the consequences is that the conservation status of pol-
linating bird and mammal species is deteriorating. Eugenie Regan of UNEP&rsquo;s
World Conservation Monitoring Centre makes the point that this trend may
be negatively impacting the global pollination services.
</p>
<p>� Positive externality in consumption: The behavior of an individual causes non-
internalized interdependencies with other individuals, which increases the value
of their consumption. An example is the decision to buy a product that is inter-
connected in a network, like a specific type of software or cellphone. The more
users coordinate on a given standard, the more valuable the standard becomes
for others. For example, the more people use the same text editor, the easier it
becomes to exchange text documents. This means that the social value of con-
sumption exceeds the individual. In other words, the Pareto-efficient demand
function lies above the market demand with uninternalized interdependencies.
Other examples are individual education decisions that raise individuals&rsquo; qual-
ifications, but also have an effect on the average literacy of a community, or
maintenance of housing that not only increases the value of the individual prop-
erty, but also the attractiveness of the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>� Negative externality in consumption: The behavior of an individual causes un-
internalized interdependencies with other individuals, which reduces the value of
their consumption. An example is noise from gardening that annoys the neigh-
bors. In this case, the Pareto-efficient demand function for gardening activities
lies below the market demand with uninternalized interdependencies. Another
example is vaccination. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
vaccination averts 2&ndash;3 million deaths per year (in all age groups) and that up to
1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented
by vaccination. The individual decision to vaccinate against a pathogen creates
a positive interdependency, because it makes the spreading of pathogens more
difficult, reducing the risk of other people getting infected. By the same token,
the individual decision not to vaccinate creates a negative interdependency. The
transaction costs of internalizing these interdependencies on markets are pro-
hibitive, leading to negative externalities in consumption.
</p>
<p>The literature on externalities is very inconsistent in its terminology, mixing the
physical properties of activities, which one calls interdependencies, together with</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>114 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>the institutional properties, which either lead to an internalization of these interde-
pendencies or do not. It should therefore be stressed again that, in a market context,
the term externality relates to missing or imperfect markets. An analysis that makes
the assumption that an externality exists does not ask for the deeper reasons for the
externality and, therefore, risks that one will draw the wrong policy conclusions,
which could have been derived from a more thorough analysis. The baker-fisherman
problem is a good example. If one starts the analysis with the premise that there is
a negative externality between the two, one assumes that the two gentlemen cannot
figure out ways to fix the problem. However, it would be in their best interest to
find a solution, because there are gains from trade. Therefore, one must explore
the deeper reasons for this failure and the institutional alternatives. This points one
towards a detailed analysis of transaction costs.
</p>
<p>Economists can sometimes be blinded by their own theories. It was, for example,
a staple in the profession that lighthouse services are a good example for positive
externalities in production, because ships cannot be excluded from the insurance
provided by the lighthouses. The obvious policy implication from this analysis
would be that the state has to step in to provide these services, because markets must
fail. However, a more detailed empirical analysis revealed that there are numerous
examples for the provision of lighthouse services without government interventions
and the key to understanding this &lsquo;curiosity&rsquo; was the realization that port owners
have an incentive to provide these services to make their ports more attractive. The
situation is similar to today&rsquo;s free TV or free services on the Internet. Content
providers give away content for free because users allow those firms to make money
on other markets, like advertising or data collection.
</p>
<p>6.2.3 The Bigger Picture
</p>
<p>It is now time to use these examples to develop a more comprehensive view on
institutions and transaction costs. The idea that something may be missing in stan-
dard theory, which helps explain institutions, goes back to a paper by Ronald Coase
that he wrote as early as 1937. Standard theory models firms simply as technologi-
cal phenomena transforming inputs into outputs, and make a behavioral assumption
that they seek to maximize profits. This &ldquo;black-box approach&rdquo; to the firm had the
advantage of simplicity and it allowed for generating a lot of deep insights into the
functioning of markets, some of which the last chapter covered. However, the stan-
dard approach turned out to be ill-suited to answering the question of why firms
exist in the first place, given the apparent efficiency of markets. Ronald Coase&rsquo;s
major insight was that transaction costs are at the heart of the problem of optimal
institutional design. Unfortunately, transaction costs are a vexed concept, because
they turned out to be very difficult to define in a precise and useful way.
</p>
<p>Much effort has been devoted to better understanding the exact conditions un-
der which the invisible hand can leverage self-interest onto social welfare and the
most useful insight, for this purpose, goes back to another paper by Ronald Coase
(1960). If society is interested in promoting efficiency, then every institution that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 115
</p>
<p>is compatible with this goal must share the same structure: it has to make sure that
individuals fully internalize the effects of their behavior on others.
</p>
<p>As suggested above, internalization of externalities can be achieved by a com-
plete set of competitive markets. The completeness of the markets implies the
absence of an important category of market-related transaction costs. The term
&ldquo;transaction costs&rdquo; is closely related to institutions, since transaction costs can be
used to assess the relative &ldquo;imperfectness&rdquo; of different institutions. This understand-
ing allows it to put the First Theorem of Welfare Economics into perspective. It was
clear from the work of theorists of socialist planning like Oskar Lange (1936, 1937)
that, under the conditions of the First Theorem of Welfare Economics, a central
planning mechanism is efficient, as well. In order to find the market clearing prices,
&ldquo;the market&rdquo; needs information that, in the hands of a central planner, would be
sufficient to implement the efficient allocation directly without the detour of market
transactions. This implies that, under ideal circumstances, the institutional structure
does not matter for the efficiency of the resulting allocation.
</p>
<p>Coase (1960) generalized this idea by creating the awareness that it is neither the
complete set of markets nor the idealized planner mechanism that is responsible for
the result, but two other, implicit assumptions, namely the rationality of economic
actors and the absence of transaction costs. The insight is of striking simplicity: if
individuals are rational and no transaction costs exist, they should always end up in
a situation where gains from trade are completely exhausted; it would simply not
be rational to leave them unexploited. This result is called the &ldquo;Coase Irrelevance
Theorem.&rdquo; In an ideal world, without transaction costs, potential externalities would
be fully internalized, whether through market prices, centralized planning in either
the form of centrally determined transfer prices or direct quantity control, or other
institutional arrangements.
</p>
<p>The implication of this finding is, of course, not that institutions do not mat-
ter in reality, but that one has to identify the institution-specific transaction costs,
if one wants to understand the relative efficiency of, for example, markets, firms
and government agencies. The transaction-costs-free economy plays the role of
the frictionless pendulum in physics: it is not a good description of reality, but a
benchmark that allows one to understand the role of frictions (or, for that matter,
transaction costs) better.
</p>
<p>A number of important research areas emerged from this benchmark over the
last decades, all of them unified by their attempt to understand transaction costs
and their implications for efficiency and the organization of economic activity. The
following are some of the most important types of transaction costs:
</p>
<p>1. Transaction costs due to the formation of contracts: as shown in the above ex-
ample, contracts are not just &ldquo;there&rdquo; but have to be negotiated, which requires
investment of scarce time and effort. Thus, contracts will only be written (and
market transactions will only be performed), if the gains from trade exceed the
(opportunity) costs of negotiations. Even buying a smoothie requires that one
enter the shop, check the price and pay.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>116 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>A very dramatic example of market failure, due to the impossibility to cope
with interdependencies by means of contracts, is the interdependencies between
generations. Most of one&rsquo;s present decisions are likely to have long-term con-
sequences far beyond one&rsquo;s own planning horizon. However, they will likely
affect the well-being of future generations. The most prominent examples are
anthropogenic climate change and nuclear power. In both cases, there surely
are intergenerational interdependencies and they cannot be internalized by the
use of markets, because one side of the contracting table has not yet been born
when the relevant decisions have to be made. Markets must create externalities
almost by definition. On the other hand, if markets must fail, what other means
does one have to include the interests of future generations? Given that unborn
people cannot be part of any decision procedure, be it market-based or political,
there is only one alternative left: the literal internalization of interdependencies
by means of moral concerns of contemporaries. If the present generations are
willing to think and act according to the legitimate claims of future generations,
then and only then is it possible to internalize the otherwise existing external-
ities. Even if political decisions to, for example, raise the price of fossil fuels
constrain individual behavior, the decision to implement these regulations is not
a result of some kind of bargaining between all the affected parties. It is a com-
mitment mechanism by contemporaries that makes it easier for them to follow
their moral standards.
</p>
<p>Digression 14. Is Thereˆ Someone to be Harmed? The Non-Identity Problem of
Intergenerational Justice
</p>
<p>There is an aspect of the problem of intergenerational justice that makes it
different from standard allocation problems between contemporaries. There
is a debate in practical philosophy about the normative status of unborn people
that focuses around the question, of whether unborn people have the same
rights as contemporaries and whether and in what sense contemporaries can
harm unborn human beings (Parfit 1984). One of the key obstacles is the so-
called non-identity problem, which argues that apparently trivial changes in
one&rsquo;s plans are likely to change the identity of the future people (for example,
because the egg is fertilized by a different sperm).
</p>
<p>Thus, changes in the political environment are likely to have some influ-
ence on the identity of future generations but, if this is the case, it cannot
be argued that anybody is worse off in the future because one is comparing
different people. A pragmatic view would accept this problem as it is and
declare the specific identity of a future human being to be morally irrelevant.
The only fact that counts, one could argue, is that future generations will
come into existence and that they can profit or can be harmed by present gen-
erations&rsquo; choices. Plausible as this approach may sound, it implies a major
deviation from standard welfarism, which builds on the idea that the welfare
of actual people is normatively relevant.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 117
</p>
<p>2. Transaction costs due to the enforcement of contracts: even in a night-watchman
state, property rights and contractual arrangements have to be backed by the
police and courts. The capital and labor costs of maintaining these agencies must
be considered part of the transaction costs of markets. From an efficiency point
of view, the police is only indirectly productive, because its presence creates
the necessary environment in which people feel save to invest and trade but, if
police were obsolete (for example because individuals behave cooperatively out
of an intrinsic motivation), capital and labor would be freed for other directly
productive purposes.
</p>
<p>3. Transaction costs due to the incompleteness of contracts: An extensively studied
problem is the role that information plays in contract design and in the perfor-
mance of institutions. There are several strands of literature that I will briefly
discuss in turn.
(a) Asymmetric information: Asymmetric information refers to a situation
</p>
<p>where one of the contracting parties is aware of information that is relevant
for the contract and that of which the other contracting party is not aware.
This situation is, of course, the rule rather than the exception, because the
parties, in almost any buyer-seller relationship, are unaware of the willing-
ness to pay or sell of the other party. Here is an example that highlights the
specific problems that may be caused by asymmetric information. Assume a
market for used cars, where the sellers are better informed about the quality
of the cars than the buyers are. The representative buyer&rsquo;s willingness to
pay depends on her assessment of the average quality of the car, which
implies that the price is not attractive for high-quality sellers. These sellers
will withdraw from the market. If the buyers anticipate this incentive, they
will further reduce their expectations about average quality and, therefore,
their willingness to pay. In the end, the market can completely unravel,
leaving only cars of poor quality for sale. George Akerlof (1970), one of
the pioneers of information economics, called this type of market a market
for lemons (a lemon is an American slang term for a car that is found to be
defective only after its purchase).
It turns out that this informational incompleteness is especially relevant on
insurance markets and explains why unregulated insurance markets are likely
to be inefficient. Specific forms of regulation, like mandatory insurance and
obligation to contract (plus some form of price regulation that is necessary
to prevent insurance companies from levering out the obligation to contract
by charging high prices), reduce these inefficiencies. This kind of regula-
tion works on insurance markets, but not generally on other markets because
the standard for efficiency is easy to set. If individuals want to avoid risk
(they are risk averse), an efficient solution is one where everybody gets full
insurance. Such a standard is relatively easy for a government to regulate.
</p>
<p>(b) Non-verifiable contracts: Some contractual arrangements may refer to prop-
erties of the good or service that are observable for both contracting parties,
but are not verifiable, for example, in front of a court. An example would be</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>118 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>a labor contract, where both parties know that the employee is cheating, but
the employer is unable to prove it.
</p>
<p>(c) Imperfect foresight: Many contracts expand into the future, which makes
the anticipation of future consequences of contractual arrangement crucial.
However, in a number of cases, the future cannot be foreseen with sufficient
precision to allow for efficient contracts. An example is a different labor
contract where a person is hired to conduct research for a company. By
definition, the terms of the contract cannot be specified contingent on the
outcome of the research project, because it would contradict the nature of re-
search and development. Something completely and qualitatively new may
come out of a research project, which makes contracts necessarily incom-
plete.
</p>
<p>ˆ From the perspective of transaction-cost economics, climate change is maybe the
worst problem someone could have invented to challenge humanity, because it com-
bines a lot of elements that human beings are ill-prepared to solve. First of all, the
very nature of intergenerational interdependencies makes it impossible for everyone
who is influenced by a decision to participate in a market or any other form of ne-
gotiation. Therefore, the only way to incorporate the interests of future generations
into today&rsquo;s decision-making is by means of the morality of the present generations.
Second, even if one is sufficiently morally motivated to care for future generations,
one has imperfect foresight about the future consequences of one&rsquo;s behavior. Third,
humanity evolved as a species that had to solve small-group problems for the better
part of its history. One&rsquo;s &ldquo;hard wired&rdquo; moral instincts are restricted to one&rsquo;s kin
and tribe. Problems on a global scale require going beyond one&rsquo;s moral intuitions
and caring for the lot of all human beings, not only one&rsquo;s relatives and fellow tribe
members. However, reason is a lazy and easily exhausted companion. The execu-
tive summary of the so-called Stern Review (2007) makes this point in all clarity:
&ldquo;The scientific evidence is now overwhelming: climate change presents very seri-
ous global risks, and it demands an urgent global response. [. . . ] Climate change
presents a unique challenge for economics: it is the greatest and widest-ranging
market failure ever seen. The economic analysis must therefore be global, deal with
long time horizons, have the economics of risk and uncertainty at center stage, and
examine the possibility of major, non-marginal change. [. . . ] The effects of our
actions now on future changes in the climate have long lead times. What we do
now can have only a limited effect on the climate over the next 40 or 50 years. On
the other hand what we do in the next 10 or 20 years can have a profound effect on
the climate in the second half of this century and in the next. No one can predict the
consequences of climate change with complete certainty; but we now know enough
to understand the risks. [. . . ] For this to work well, policy must promote sound
market signals, overcome market failures and have equity and risk mitigation at its
core.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The following subchapter will cover the examples of traffic congestion and en-
vironmental problems in order to illustrate how the concept of transaction costs can
be used to understand the organization of economic activity better and to design
solutions for externality problems.</p>

<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 119
</p>
<p>6.2.3.1 Externalities in Traffic
</p>
<p>A society sufficiently sophisticated to produce the internal combustion engine has not had
the sophistication to develop cheap and efficient public transport?
</p>
<p>Yes, boss . . . it&rsquo;s true. There&rsquo;s hardly any buses, the trains are hopelessly underfunded,
and hence the entire population is stuck in traffic. (Ben Elton (1991), Gridlock)
</p>
<p>The most common feeling of car drivers who are locked in a traffic jam is anger,
but these psychological costs are only the tip of the iceberg of the economic costs
caused by crowded streets and overburdened infrastructure. The main causes of
traffic jams are accidents, poor infrastructure, peak-hour traffic and variable traf-
fic speeds on congested roads. The Centre for Economics and Business Research
and INRIX (a company providing Internet services pertaining to road traffic) has
estimated the impact of such delays on the British, French, German, and American
economies. Here are some of the main findings (US data):
</p>
<p>� The costs of congestion summed up to $124 billion in 2013. This cost is (ceteris
paribus) expected to increase 50 percent to $186 billion by 2030. The cumulative
cost over the 17-year period is projected to be $2.8 trillion.
</p>
<p>� The annual cost of traffic for each American household is $1700 today. This
cost is expected to rise to $2300 in 2030, with huge regional variations (the cost
is $6000 in the Los Angeles area). To put these numbers into perspective, the
median household income was $51,939 in 2013.
</p>
<p>� The monetary value of carbon emissions caused by congestion was $300 million
in 2013. By 2030, this is expected to rise to $538 million, totaling $7.6 billion
over the 17-year period.
</p>
<p>Congestion costs of traffic can legitimately count as an externality, because the main
causes of these costs are (a) opportunity costs of time, (b) costs of carbon and other
emissions and (c) price effects of higher transportation costs. In order to understand
this conjecture, it makes sense to look at a car driver&rsquo;s decision problem. When
deciding if, when or where to use streets, she takes individual costs and benefits
into consideration. However, the lion&rsquo;s share of costs and benefits spills over onto
other traffic participants and the general public. Emissions cause either regional
or global effects, which are not included in the individual&rsquo;s decision problem, and
other drivers&rsquo; wasted time is also neglected. The reason is that decentralized negoti-
ations about when and where to use the streets would lead to prohibitive transaction
costs.
</p>
<p>What else can one do to make traffic more efficient? What are the institutional
alternatives? Solving congestion is not easy. Building more roads, or widening ex-
isting ones, can encourage people to drive even more. Charging road users for
travelling at busy periods can help to solve the efficiency problem, but it may
cause other problems. To highlight them, one can focus on the London Congestion
Charge. The standard charge in 2016 was &pound;11.50 on most motor vehicles operat-
ing within the Congestion Charge Zone (Central London) between 07:00 a.m. and
08:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. In theory, the charge should be set such that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>120 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>the individual driver pays a price that is equal to the costs caused by his decision to
use a specific network of streets during a given time period. Hence, if the charge
is calculated correctly, one can infer that the externality caused by a single driver
is approximately &pound;11.50. If the price of going to central London goes up, demand
should go down and one gets the desired increase in efficiency, because congestion
is reduced. What makes this instrument problematic is that is has distributional con-
sequences, because the fee is especially burdensome for the relatively poor, who are
disproportionately deterred from coming to the city center by car.
</p>
<p>Digression 15. The Role of Public Space in Democracyˆ
Congestion charges or road prices not only have distributive consequences,
which one might find objectionable, but also have more profound effects on
how one thinks about the societal role of public space. In a democracy, pub-
lic spaces have an important role in the expression of political opinions, as
locations for spontaneous gatherings and, more generally, places where a rep-
resentative profile of people comes together and has the right to do so. A
public space is a site where democracy becomes possible. Henri Lefebvre
(1974) made this point quite poignantly: &ldquo;(Social) space is a (social) product
[. . . ] the space thus produced also serves as a tool of thought and of action
[. . . ] in addition to being a means of production it is also a means of con-
trol, and hence of domination, of power.&rdquo; Charging high prices for the access
to public space, which makes it more difficult for specific groups to access
them is, therefore, politically questionable. A narrow economic view, which
focuses on efficiency gains, easily loses sight of the bigger context in which
the instruments are embedded.
</p>
<p>A good example for the relationship between democracy and public space
is the Landsgemeinde (cantonal assembly). This is a Swiss institution where
eligible citizens of the canton meet on a certain day in a public space and
debate and decide on laws and public expenditures. Another example is the
Speakers&rsquo; Corner, an area for unrestricted public speaking, debate and dis-
cussion, which became a symbol for the importance of unrestricted access
to public space in a democracy. An interesting, yet unresolved, question is
whether virtual public space on the internet can take over the role of physical
public space, thereby overcoming physical and legal boundaries.
</p>
<p>6.2.3.2 Environmental Externalities
</p>
<p>Climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has seen. (Nicholas Stern)
</p>
<p>The metaphor is so obvious. Easter Island isolated in the Pacific Ocean &ndash; once the island
got into trouble, there was no way they could get free. There was no other people from
whom they could get help. In the same way that we on Planet Earth, if we ruin our own
[world], we won&rsquo;t be able to get help. (Jared Diamond (2005), Collapse: How Societies
Choose to Fail or Succeed)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 121
</p>
<p>Oil spills that waste beautiful beaches and wilderness areas are only the tip of
the iceberg of environmental externalities. The following are some examples of
environmental externalities in production that lead to social costs that are not in-
ternalized by market prices. Unregulated air pollution from burning fossil fuels
becomes a problem, if no market for pollutants exists. Anthropogenic climate
change, as a consequence of greenhouse gas emissions, involves future generations.
Negative effects of industrial animal farming include, for example, the overuse of
antibiotics that results in bacterial resistance and the contamination of the environ-
ment with animal waste. Another problem is the cost of storing nuclear waste from
nuclear plants for very long periods of time.
</p>
<p>There is a broad consensus among scientists that the rate of species loss is greater
now than at any time in human history. In 2007, the German Federal Environment
Minister acknowledged that up to 30% of all species would be extinct by 2010. The
Living Planet Report 2014 comes to the conclusion that &ldquo;the number of mammals,
birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the
size it was 40 years ago.&rdquo; If one follows the scientific consensus and assumes that
part of the loss in biodiversity is a consequence of the economic system, the question
is whether this loss is a result of externalities. Is it possible that mass extinction
of species can be Pareto-efficient? This is a tough question, because it requires
information about the role of biodiversity in supporting human life on this planet
and it relies on assumption about the way humans value biodiversity per se. If one
starts with the conservative assumption that biodiversity has only instrumental value
in supporting human life and if one admits that intergenerational externalities exist,
because current generations do not adequately take the interests of future ones into
consideration, then one can make a case for the existence of an externality. This
is if one assumes that a more diverse biosphere is more likely to support human
life than an impoverished one. This latter conjecture, however, is built on deep
uncertainty of the complex role of the biosphere in supporting human life. The
deeper problem is that the concept of Pareto-efficiency, as seen before, is blind
with respect to the distribution of gains from trade, and, more generally, economic
welfare. A policy where the present generation has a big &lsquo;party&rsquo; and uses up most
of the natural resources, leaving a devastated planet where future generations scrap
along at the subsistence level, is Pareto-efficient as long as there is no alternative
policy to make future generations better off without harming the present ones.
</p>
<p>The concept of Pareto-efficiency has a lot of shortcomings when it comes to
long-term problems, which is why is has been supplemented, and even replaced,
by the concept of sustainability in the normative social and natural sciences and
in politics. The most popular definition of the concept of sustainable development
goes back to the so-called Brundtland Commission of the United Nations (1987):
&ldquo;sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present with-
out compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&rdquo; This
concept implicitly acknowledges the right of future generations to live a decent life
and is, therefore, stronger than the Pareto criterion. However, it still suffers from
the need to understand the complex role of ecosystems and it is anthropocentric in
nature. I will come back to this latter point at the end of this subchapter.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>122 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>Returning to a less complex externality, the example of an oil spill illustrates
the basic problems and solutions. Assume that a company operates a fleet of oil
tankers, which move large quantities of crude oil from its point of extraction to the
refineries. The environmental risk of this business model is that oil spills, due to
accidents, affect the (marine) environment and may also affect the fishing industry.
One can divide the discussion into two parts. Part one assumes that it is possible to
attach a meaningful monetary value to the damage caused by oil spills and to ask for
institutional arrangements that lead to efficient outcomes. Part two scrutinizes this
assumption and takes a closer look at the normative issues that are involved when
attaching price tags to oil spills.
</p>
<p>The risk of an accident can be influenced by the shipping companies&rsquo; investment
in safety technology. A profit-oriented company faces a tradeoff between the costs
and benefits of such investments and the question is whether it adequately reflects
the social costs and benefits when it makes its decisions. In an unregulated market,
with only property rights and contract law, this is very unlikely, because many peo-
ple are potentially influenced by an oil spill, so decentralized negotiations cannot
solve the problem efficiently. Therefore, safety standards are presumably ineffi-
ciently low in an unregulated market. How can one internalize these externalities?
I will discuss three different instruments:
</p>
<p>� A very direct and crude way of enforcing safety standards is by setting and
enforcing mandatory standards. This instrument is effective, if enforcement is
guaranteed, but not necessarily efficient. It becomes the more efficient, the more
homogeneous the global fleet is because, in this case, the costs and benefits of
a reduction in the risk of accidents are the same for all tankers. Unfortunately
this is not the case and, the more heterogeneous the ships are, the less efficient
a homogenous regulation will be. One could argue that this is not a problem, as
long as regulation can be fine-tuned to the specific characteristics of the tanker,
but regulations that are more complicated are more difficult to enact and enforce.
Therefore, it is very likely that, in practice, standards would lead to some effi-
ciency losses.
</p>
<p>� It is also possible to tax activities that are positively correlated with risks and to
offer state subsidies for activities that are negatively correlated with risks. Taxes
and subsidies change the perceived prices, either making risky activities more
costly or making risk-avoiding activities cheaper. The effect is that one creates
incentives to influence investments into safety in a socially desirable way. The
major advantage of this solution is that, unlike with standardization, this instru-
ment works selectively for different types of tankers and it is, in principle, able to
avoid inefficiencies that result from the one-size-fits-all approach of standards.
However, a tax-subsidy system has to be administered, which causes transaction
costs of its own.
</p>
<p>� Last, but not least, one can react with the introduction of liability law. Li-
ability law makes shipping companies pay in case of damage. Liability law
increases the costs of the firms in case of an accident and is, therefore, a theo-
retically promising instrument for internalizing externalities. When it becomes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 123
</p>
<p>more costly to have an accident, the company will be more prudent and invest in
higher safety standards. However, this legal instrument can conflict with other
legal instruments, which have legitimizations of their own. For example, most
countries have an insolvency law that restricts the risks of firms and individuals.
If such a law is in place, the worst that can happen to a firm is for it to become
insolvent, which effectively restricts its monetary risks. Since oil spills are usu-
ally big events, liability law can, therefore, be a toothless tiger, if the owners of
the company are protected by insolvency regulations.
</p>
<p>The above discussion has shown that there are several tools for coping with environ-
mental externalities in the economist&rsquo;s toolbox and it depends on the case at hand
which tool (or combination of tools) will work best.
</p>
<p>The second aspect of the problem, which one should at least briefly consider, is
the question of whether it is possible to attach a price tag to environmental dam-
ages. It is relatively uncontroversial that it is possible to get reasonable estimates of
damages to the local fishing or tourism industries, because the goods and services
they provide have market prices and past experience gives a good proxy for the
loss in revenues and profits that result from environmental damages. The question
becomes more involved, if one tries to estimate the non-economic costs to human
beings that result from the depletion of resources such as air, water, and soil, the
destruction of ecosystems and the extinction of wildlife. What is the value of a
species of beetle to humankind, which is threatened to become extinct?
</p>
<p>ˆHowever, a radical position would even go beyond the evaluation of non-
economic (in a narrow sense) damages and scrutinize the implied anthropocentrism
implicit in the normative values underlying Pareto efficiency (or more generally
welfarism) and also in the idea of sustainability in the sense of the Brundtland
report. According to, for example, the deep ecology movement, heavily influenced
by the Norwegian philosopher Arne N&aelig;s, animals, wildlife and biosystems have
intrinsic value, whereas the mainstream approach is to see them exclusively as
means for human ends. The latter approach would deny wildlife a right to exis-
tence, if it does not serve any needs of human beings. The deep ecology movement
would reject the characterization of non-human life as a means to an end. The core
principle is the belief that the living environment, as a whole, should be respected
and regarded as having certain inalienable legal rights to live and flourish, indepen-
dent of its utilitarian instrumental benefits for human use. This has far-reaching
consequences for normative economics, which are based on welfaristic ideas about
good and bad, right and wrong. From the perspective of deep ecology, classifying a
meat market as being efficient is completely off the mark, because animals are ends
and not means to human needs. A comparison to slave marketsx is illuminating:
trading slaves on markets can be classified as Pareto-efficient, as long as one denies
slaves human and civil rights and does not see them as ends, but rather as means for
the needs of the class of &ldquo;non-slaves.&rdquo; Hence, it is a meaningful problem to discuss
the efficiency properties of slave markets in such a society. As soon as one extends
basic human and civil rights to all human beings and declares them unalienable,
however, there is no meaningful way to discuss the efficiency of such a market,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>124 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>because the traded &ldquo;resources&rdquo; are no longer means, but rather ends in themselves.
One gets the same fundamental transformation if one grants rights to non-human
species.
</p>
<p>It would be far beyond the scope of an introductory textbook to dig deeper into
the thorny issues of environmental ethics and the consequences for one&rsquo;s perception
of economic systems. What the above discussion should have made clear, however,
is that our perception of markets relies on normative principles that are &ndash; despite
their widespread acceptance &ndash; far from obvious and innocuous.
</p>
<p>There are other, less obvious, ways to cope with externalities and also other,
less obvious, sources of externalities in markets. The next two examples focus
on business ethics and, especially, the concept of corporate social responsibility
(CSR), status concerns and relative-performance measurement as illustrations.
</p>
<p>6.2.3.3 Morality and Corporate Social Responsibility
</p>
<p>Globalization makes it clear that social responsibility is required not only of governments,
but of companies and individuals. (Attributed to Anna Lindh (2002))
</p>
<p>In the realistic case that the institutional structure of a state is imperfect, in the
sense that it does not always provide incentives for (Pareto-)efficient behavior, the
question is how the people within society do or should deal with these inefficiencies.
An example of this is when property rights are imperfectly enforced because of high
transaction costs. The better part of everyday transactions is, for example, formally
but not materially protected by property rights, because it would be too costly to
enforce them. If a customer buys a bottle of orange juice at a kiosk and the retail
clerk refuses to give back the change, the opportunity costs of calling the police,
verifying the tort (which is difficult, if the retail clerk refuses to confess), etc. are
likely prohibitive. Alternatively, on that subject, it is equally unlikely that the retail
clerk can do much to prevent the customer from saying thank you and walking
away with the bottle of juice without paying for it. Property rights cannot explain
the fact that the overwhelming number of these transactions take place smoothly
and efficiently.
</p>
<p>There must be other mechanisms at work, and I will briefly discuss two of them.
First, the interaction may not be singular but rather repeated and, if there is always
a probability that the customer and the retail clerk will meet again in the future,
it would be rather shortsighted to sacrifice future trades for the (relatively small)
present gain. Repeated interactions can, therefore, be used to build up a reputation
as a reliable trading partner, which can stabilize transactions, even in situations
where formal property rights cannot be protected by the state. Second, the trading
partner may have an intrinsic motivation to play fair. There is broad, scientific
consensus by now that individuals are, for good evolutionary reasons, not always
selfish, but have the ability and also (sometimes) the desire to act morally. The
willingness to keep one&rsquo;s promises, to pay one&rsquo;s bills, etc., however, depends very
much on the perception of the situational context. If people have the feeling that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Transaction Costs 125
</p>
<p>&ndash; by and large &ndash; society gives everyone his or her fair share, their willingness to
cooperate, to act fairly and to voluntarily follow certain moral standards of behavior
is much larger than in a situation that is considered unfair from the beginning. Social
norms and the intrinsic desire to act morally are then substitutes for formal property-
rights enforcement. The more porous the system of property-rights enforcement is,
the more important moral behavior becomes.
</p>
<p>How relevant is the above observation? Is moral behavior, as the example sug-
gests, only necessary for small-scale transactions, like buying soft drinks at kiosks,
or is there more to the story? Here is an example. As one has seen, imperfect and
asymmetric information is potentially a major cause of transaction costs. There-
fore, in all cases where the better-informed party can exploit the other party, moral
behavior can reduce transaction costs and facilitate trade. This view has been nicely
expressed by Kenneth Arrow (1971): &ldquo;In the absence of trust [. . . ] opportunities
for mutually beneficial cooperation would have to be forgone [. . . ] norms of social
behavior, including ethical and moral codes (may be) [. . . ] reactions of society to
compensate for market failures.&rdquo; What could be scrutinized in this quote is the im-
plied supremacy of markets. It is too narrow of a view to see morality only as a
repair shop for market failures. However, the general point is irrespectively valid:
if specialization, exchange and trust go hand in hand, it is much easier for a society
to flourish.
</p>
<p>As one will see below, the existence of public goods, like infrastructure, basic
research or defense, is a reason why the state can improve efficiency by playing a
role beyond the enforcement of property rights. In order to be able to do so, the state
needs to have access to finances, which are primarily collected as taxes. The process
of globalization has, however, created opportunities for (multinational) firms and
(mainly) wealthy individuals to minimize their tax burden by ever more complicated
financial constructions. It may be a good deal for small countries to attract big
companies by low tax rates, but the result is a global tax structure and provision
of public goods that is inefficient. The point is that the international system of
sovereign national states and international tax treaties creates loopholes and leads
to discretionary power for firms and wealthy individuals and, despite the OECD
initiatives, it is unrealistic to close those loopholes by means of enforceable treaties.
As a consequence, one can either accept the resulting inefficiencies or appeal to the
moral responsibilities of these firms or people. This is what the former Swedish
politician Anna Lindh had in mind in the quote from the beginning of this section
and international tax evasion strategies, of course, do not exhaust the number of
challenges imposed by globalization.
</p>
<p>BIn the field of Business Ethics, corporate social responsibility (CSR) emerged as
a separate field of research, exactly because current trends in international markets
led to a redistribution of power from the institutions of the traditional state into the
hands of corporations. One of the key questions, in this literature, is whether this
increase in power goes hand in hand with the moral responsibilities of the managers
and the corporation as an institutional actor.</p>

<p>126 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>6.2.3.4 Status
</p>
<p>From whence, then, arises that emulation which runs through all the different ranks of men,
and what are the advantages which we propose by that great purpose of human life which
we call bettering our condition? To be observed, to be attended to, to be taken notice of with
sympathy, complacency, and approbation, are all the advantages which we can propose to
derive from it. It is the vanity, not the ease, or the pleasure, which interests us. (Adam
Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiment, Chapter II.)
</p>
<p>Comparison brings about frustration and merely encourages envy, which is called compe-
tition. (Jiddu Krishnamurti (2005))
</p>
<p>Social comparisons and the urge to outperform others seem to be deep motivational
factors for human beings. Humans are, sometimes, a cooperative but, even more
regularly, they are a competitive species and there are good evolutionary reasons
for why relative performance is an important factor in mate selection. The human
metabolism also requires that some absolute standards are met to stay healthy (for
example daily caloric intake) but, apart from that, relative (status) concerns are an
important factor for the explanation of human behavior across cultures and times.
</p>
<p>However, this powerful drive has a dark side to it and almost all spiritual tradi-
tions from Christianity to Buddhism warn people that the concern for relative status
is the road to unhappiness and suffering and that the way towards a fulfilling live
is to free oneself from social comparisons. Mark Twain has the, perhaps, shortest
account of this fact: &ldquo;Comparison is the death of joy.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>May this be as it is; is there anything that one can say, as an economist, about
the functioning of markets, if demand is driven by status concerns? The first obser-
vation that one can make is that scarcity works differently for status than for other
goods. Say one is eating apples for nourishment. An additional apple makes one
better off, irrespective of what the other people are doing. Thus, if everybody in
society eats twice as many apples, everybody is better off. This is not true for status
goods. If cars are acting as a status symbol (or for that matter, smartphones or Prada
shoes) and one buys a bigger car, while no one else in one&rsquo;s neighborhood does the
same, then one gains in status and prestige. However, if everyone buys a bigger car,
the effects neutralize and one ends up in the same status position as before, when
everyone had the smaller car. It is like running a race: if everyone trains harder and
runs faster, the odds of winning remain the same but, if one is the only one who
&ldquo;goes the extra mile,&rdquo; then one can tip the balance in one&rsquo;s direction.
</p>
<p>What this example shows is that technological progress or an increase in material
well-being can alleviate scarcity for ordinary goods (people live healthier, longer
lives, are better nourished, etc.), but not for social status. This is why status is called
a position good. It is the relative ranking in the pecking order that determines one&rsquo;s
position and, if everyone works twice as hard to improve, then no one will be better
off in the end. It might even be the case that a point is reached when everybody is
worse off, when people start paying tribute for working longer hours. However, do
status concerns create externalities in market economies? To understand this, one
can use the extended supply and demand analysis introduced in Sect. 6.2.2. Assume</p>

<p>that x measures supply and demand for a status good (mechanical watches), which
means that part of the reason for buying this good is to impress the neighbors.
Assume further that this interdependency between one and one&rsquo;s neighbor cannot
be internalized directly (think about it: &ldquo;how much would you pay me to not buy
that Rolex?&rdquo;). In that case, the individual value of the status good is, in general,
higher than the social value.
</p>
<p>One may wonder if positional externalities are a mere theoretical curiosity, or if
anything more significant is going on. One way to approach this problem is to look
for empirical evidence that is anomalous, given the predictions of standard theory
(without status concerns), but that can consistently be explained, if one accounts
for status. In fact, such evidence exists and it became famous as the &ldquo;happiness
paradox.&rdquo; However, it is still highly contested whether the empirical findings are
valid.
</p>
<p>The happiness paradox refers to patterns in empirical research on happiness.
Two findings are key for it. The first relates to the relationship between average
subjective happiness and average income. The findings are summarized in Fig. 6.4.
</p>
<p>The figure depicts average happiness levels and average income levels in differ-
ent countries. It shows that there is a positive association between average happiness
and average income up to an annual income of about $12,000. However, there is</p>

<p>Fig. 6.5 Individual happiness as a function of individual income. (Source: Stevenson &amp; Wolfers,
2008; General Social Survey, 2006)
</p>
<p>no positive association between average happiness and average income for higher
income levels. This &ldquo;flatness&rdquo; is sometimes also referred to as the &ldquo;hedonic tread-
mill&rdquo; where one runs faster and faster without moving forward. This finding is
difficult to square with the idea that individuals are mutually unconcerned or self-
ish, because this assumption would imply that increases in material well-being (and
average income should be a proxy for this) increase subjective well-being (i.e. hap-
piness). This is apparently not the case. Here is a nice summary of this aspect of the
paradox: &ldquo;People in the West have got no happier in the last 50 years. They have
become much richer, they work much less, they have longer holidays, they travel
more, they live longer, and they are healthier. But they are no happier.&rdquo; (Layard,
2005)
</p>
<p>The second finding refers to individual happiness levels as a function of individ-
ual income within countries, see Fig. 6.5.
</p>
<p>The figure reveals that richer individuals are happier than poorer individuals, in
a given society, and this is the puzzle: how is it possible that individual income is
a good proxy for individual happiness while, at the same time, these effects net out
for the whole society as soon as the average income exceeds a certain minimum?
</p>
<p>Status preferences provide a missing link for resolving this puzzle: in poor coun-
tries, where individuals have to fight for subsistence, the relative importance of
non-status-related compared to status-related consumption and production is high.
However, the richer a society gets, the more important status concerns become.
Thus, in these societies, there is no longer a positive association between average
income and average happiness, because status effects &ldquo;net out.&rdquo; If one climbs up</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.3 Four Boundary Cases 129
</p>
<p>on the status ladder, someone else necessarily has to climb it down. However, in-
creases in individual income make a difference, because one climbs higher on the
status ladder, and the negative happiness effects on others that result from this im-
provement are irrelevant for one&rsquo;s individual happiness.
</p>
<p>As I have mentioned before, the findings and the interpretation of the happiness
paradox are contested, but they are in line with a lot of evidence from other fields,
like evolutionary biology, where relative fitness is key for mating and therefore evo-
lutionary success of ones&rsquo; genes. Additionally, it comes as no surprise that all the
major spiritual traditions humans have created attach large warning signs to indi-
vidual comparisons. However, even if one takes the interpretation at face value, the
policy implications are complicated. Should one infer from the hedonic treadmill
that the state has an active role in the internalization of status externalities that is
similar to its role in the internalization of, for example, environmental externalities
(taxation of status goods, etc.), or should one leave it to the individual to overcome
the attachment to status? These are deep questions and they are even more pressing
because, as long as social norms have declare that social status is a function of ma-
terial well-being, one straps oneself to the wheel of consumerism and materialism,
which is, at least partly, responsible for the environmental externalities mentioned
above.
</p>
<p>6.3 Four Boundary Cases
</p>
<p>[T]hey devote a very small fraction of time to the consideration of any public object, most
of it to the prosecution of their own objects. Meanwhile each fancies that no harm will
come to his neglect, that it is the business of somebody else to look after this or that for
him; and so, by the same notion being entertained by all separately, the common cause
imperceptibly decays. (Thucydides (2013), The Peleponnesian War, Book 1, Section 141)
</p>
<p>Coming back to the variations of the bakery example from the last subchapter, the
distinctive difference between the two types of environmental interdependencies
(sewage and air pollution) was the physical &ldquo;reach&rdquo; of the interdependency-causing
activity. In the sewage-case, there was only one person, the fisherman, who caused
the interdependency with the bakery whereas, in the air-pollution case, the bakery
influenced all the residents. These differences in the number of people, who are
influenced by economic activities, are an important element in the classification
of goods and services and in developing an understanding of the functioning of
markets.
</p>
<p>The implicit assumption behind the model of competitive markets discussed in
Chap. 4 was that the interdependency is bilateral. A typical example for a bilateral
interdependency is an apple. Either one or the other person can eat an apple (one
cannot eat the same apple twice), so Ann&rsquo;s decision to sell an apple to Bill has no
direct physical consequences for third parties. The same was true in the sewage ex-
ample. However, the bilateralism of the interdependency was a result of the fact that
only one fisherman made his living from the lake. If two fishermen had have cast
their nets into the lake, the interdependency would have been trilateral, because the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>130 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>emissions by the factory would have reduced the catches of both fishermen. In the
air-pollution example, the reach of the interdependency was even larger, covering
all residents of the area. This observation motivates the following definition.
</p>
<p>I Definition 6.3, reach✍ The reach of an economic activity is the set of people di-
rectly influenced by the activity.
</p>
<p>The two meaningful boundary cases are the minimum and the maximum reach.
The use of a good with minimum reach has an effect on only one person, and the
use of a good with maximum reach has an effect on all individuals in an economy.
A good with minimum reach is called rival in consumption, and a good with maxi-
mum reach is called non-rival in consumption. Combined with scarcity, goods with
minimum reach create a bilateral interdependency. One has already seen that an ap-
ple is an example for a rival good and it is either person A or B who gets nourished
by the apple. An example for a global non-rival good is a fossil-fuel combustion
increasing CO2 levels which, in turn, contributes to anthropogenic climate change,
which has an impact on all individuals on the planet. Finally, an example for a
national, non-rival good is the protection against foreign aggressors due to national
defense.
</p>
<p>A good part of the goods and services fall in-between these extremes. The reach
of national defense, for example, is the boundaries of the nation-state. A live sports
event or a music concert has a reach that is limited to the visitors of the stadium
or concert hall. Additionally, a piece of music uploaded on YouTube has everyone
with internet access within its potential reach. Even though reach can vary widely
in range, it is customary to start with a discussion of the two extreme forms of rival
and non-rival goods and this book will stick to this custom here, keeping in mind
that the understanding that one can develop from these cases must be somewhat
modified, when applied to intermediate cases.
</p>
<p>What one has also seen from the air-pollution example is that different types
of transaction costs exist that have an impact on the functioning of markets, as
well as on other institutions. In order to be able to use markets to allocate goods
and services, one relies on the ability of the owner of the good to exclude others
from its use. Without excludability, people would freely use the goods and services
provided by others with the consequence that market transactions would never take
place. Excludability of goods and services is, therefore, a necessary condition for
the establishment of markets and the (opportunity) costs of exclusion are a major
source of transaction costs in the market mechanism. This motivates the following
definition:
</p>
<p>I Definition 6.4, exclusion costs✍ The transaction costs that are necessary to exclude
third parties from the appropriation and use of goods and services owned by a per-
son are called exclusion costs.
</p>
<p>The reach of an economic activity and the exclusion costs span a two-dimensional
map where goods can be pinned down according to their specific characteristics.
Figure 6.6 illustrates this point.</p>

<p>Fig. 6.6 Types of goods according to reach and exclusion costs
</p>
<p>The four corners of this &ldquo;map&rdquo; define the boundary cases of minimum and maxi-
mum reach and zero and prohibitive exclusion costs. In reality, all goods are located
somewhere in the middle. A point like A could, for example, be a car. Its reach is
to carry up to five persons and exclusion costs are given by the price for locks and
the alarm system.
</p>
<p>Exclusion costs can vary over time. Take music as an example. In the good
old days of the phonograph record, excluding third parties from the illegal con-
sumption of music was relatively easy: in the absence of technologies for copying,
exclusion required investments to prevent the theft of the physical record. The piece
of music, as such, was non-rival in consumption, but the specific physical &ldquo;carrier&rdquo;,
the record, made it de facto rival (a point like B in the figure). With the inven-
tion of music cassettes, copying music became easier, which had an impact on the
way property rights had to be protected. However, the big change came, of course,
with the digitalization and distribution of music via the internet. This technologi-
cal change essentially transformed music from a rival to a non-rival good and had
a huge impact on the ability of the owner to exclude people from the illegal use
of music (a shift from point B to point C in the figure). It took the music industry
years to cope with this problem and to develop new business models. Technological
inventions like copy and data-storage devices can, therefore, cause externalities for
other products, like music or software.</p>

</p>
<p>Excludable Private goods Club goods
</p>
<p>Non-excludable Common goods Public goods
</p>
<p>Again, custom has it that one focuses on the two most extreme manifestations of
exclusion costs. If exclusion causes zero transaction costs, then the good or service
is called (perfectly) excludable. If exclusion causes prohibitive transaction costs,
then the good or service is called (perfectly) non-excludable. Perfect excludability
is, obviously, a simplifying assumption. To quote Madison in the Federalist Papers
No. 51, &ldquo;If men were angels, no government would be necessary,&rdquo; because mankind
would never steal, which is the only way perfect exclusion is possible without any
costs. Otherwise, shop owners protect their shops by locks, security systems and
guards, all of which contribute to transaction costs. The same is true for the general
public that protects its flats, houses and cars against theft. However, some goods
come relatively close to the ideal of perfect excludability, for example the above-
mentioned apple. An essential good that is non-excludable is oxygen in the air. Just
try to enforce any property rights on a specific molecule.
</p>
<p>The extreme cases of rivalry and excludability give rise to a two-by-two matrix
of goods that is useful for a first discussion of the different types of challenges that
have to be overcome, if one wants to organize economic activities. Table 6.1 gives
an overview. The four boundary cases are called private goods, common goods,
club goods, and public goods, and I will discuss them in turn.
</p>
<p>Private goods One does not have to devote much time and attention to private
goods, because they are the ones whose efficient production and distribution can be
organized relatively easily, at least in principle. They are also the type of good that
is implicitly assumed in the theory of competitive markets, which is analyzed in
Chap. 4. Their minimum reach makes the interdependence bilateral under con-
ditions of scarcity and market prices induce efficient incentives to produce and
exchange these goods. If it is, furthermore, costless to exclude others from the
use of these goods, without consent from the owners, there is nothing standing in
the way of establishing markets.
</p>
<p>Common goods Things are getting much more involved when it comes to com-
mon goods. These goods share the minimum-reach property, but it is not possible
to allocate them using market mechanisms, because the owner of these goods can-
not prevent others from their use, which is a prerequisite for the functioning of
market transactions. The ability to exclude others from the use of resources, goods,
and services depends very much on the state&rsquo;s ability to function properly. Even
the night-watchman state needs laws and law enforcement to support the develop-
ment of markets and, with weak state institutions (insufficient funding of the police,
corrupt officials, etc.), excludability is far from guaranteed, which prevents markets
from functioning efficiently. Irrespective of the quality of institutions, though, there</p>

<p>yield

</p>
<p>Fig. 6.7 Maximum sustainable yield
</p>
<p>are some goods and resources, whose inherent qualities make exclusion very costly.
Examples are migratory species, like fish and birds, or oxygen (see above). In
comparison to cattle, where the assignment of property rights to specific animals is
possible and effectively enforceable in principle, it is very hard to assign and en-
force property rights to individual fish. This need not be an impediment to effective
exclusion, as long as close substitutes to property rights for fish exist, and a close
substitute could be property rights over the part of the sea where a shoal of fish
lives. For example, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea assigns
exclusive economic zones (EEZ) to states. These zones grant special rights regard-
ing the exploration and use of marine resources to nation states. They stretch from
the baseline out to 200 nautical miles from its coast (as long as there are no overlaps
between different countries). Territories beyond this stretch are international waters
without exclusively assigned user rights.
</p>
<p>Exclusion is, therefore, possible for all fish that migrate only within the bound-
aries of a given EEZ. However, for fish that migrate beyond or across the EEZs
or in international waters, property rights over the sea are no effective substitutes
for property rights over the fish themselves. The result is often overexploitation,
because sustainable shoal management is not in the interest of the states or the fish-
ery fleets: they have to bear the (opportunity) costs of sustainable management, but
part of the revenues spill over to other nations or fleets. In order to understand this
problem better, it makes sense to dig a little deeper into the economics of renewable
resource management. For all renewable resources, there is a causal relationship
between the size of the stock and the yield. If the stock size is zero, obviously,
the yield is zero, as well. Increasing stock size makes positive yields possible and
the yield increases with stock size up to a certain point, where larger stocks require
smaller yields again, up to the point of maximum stock size, which can only be
sustained if the yield is zero. Figure 6.7 shows this relationship.
</p>
<p>The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is the largest yield (or catch for the fish-
ery example) that can be taken from a species&rsquo; stock over an indefinite period. It
is given by point MSY in Fig. 6.7. Given this biological law, it is in the interest</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>134 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>of a long-term business to adjust the yield around MSY . Underexploitation would
leave money on the table and overexploitation would trade long-term for short-term
profits. However, if the stock is not excludable, the incentives to act according to the
long-run interests are diminished, because no user of the stock can be sure that the
stock will still be there tomorrow. There is a tension between the logic of individual
and the logic of collective action. I will come back to this point in Chap. 11.
</p>
<p>Digression 16. Codˆ
One of the most &lsquo;famous&rsquo; examples for the overexploitation of marine re-
sources is gadus morhua, or cod. Cod has been a very important commodity
for about 600 years and dried cod (also called stockfish or clipfish) was an es-
sential food for mariners. During the Middle Ages and the Age of Discovery,
it was one of the most important commodities that made seafaring possible,
because dried cod was one of the world&rsquo;s first non-perishable foods. It also
became a popular food in Europe and, for about 250 years, 60 percent of all
the fish eaten in Europe was cod. As early as 1620, cod fishing was at the
center of international conflict, because various nations attempted to monop-
olize rich fishing grounds. Even the King of Spain married off his son to the
royal house of Portugal, because of fishing rights. By the late 1700&rsquo;s, codfish
made New England an international commercial power.
</p>
<p>For a very long time, it was beyond imagination that human activity could
negatively impact the species, because it was famous for its reproduction
rates. In the words of Alexandre Dumas (1873), &ldquo;It has been calculated that
if no accident prevented the hatching of the eggs and each egg reached ma-
turity, it would take only three years to fill the sea so that you could walk
across the Atlantic dryshod on the backs of cod.&rdquo; Human imagination proved
to be too limited. Since the late 1950ies, technological advances, which have
made fishing more effective, have heralded the start of a period of overfish-
ing, which led to a first partial collapse of Atlantic northwest cod fishery in
the 1970ies and a complete collapse in the 1990ies. In the summer of 1992,
the Northern Cod biomass fell to 1% of its earlier level, see Fig. 6.8.
</p>
<p>Cod is only a very prominent example of the problem of overfishing: the
Peruvian coastal anchovy fisheries crashed in the 1970s after overfishing, the
sole fisheries in the Irish Sea and the west English Channel have become
hopelessly overfished and many deep-sea fish are at risk, as well as a number
of species of tuna. A 2008 UN report asserts that the world&rsquo;s fishing fleet
could be halved with no change in catch. Even more fundamental is the im-
pact on the whole marine biosystem. Scientific evidence regarding the impact
of humans on marine life is nicely summarized in a recent paper by McCauley
et al. (2015): &ldquo;Three lessons emerge when comparing the marine and terres-
trial defaunation experiences: (i) today&rsquo;s low rates of marine extinction may
be the prelude to a major extinction pulse, similar to that observed on land
during the industrial revolution, as the footprint of human ocean use widens;</p>

<p>(ii) effectively slowing ocean defaunation requires both protected areas and
careful management of the intervening ocean matrix; and (iii) the terrestrial
experience and current trends in ocean use suggest that habitat destruction is
likely to become an increasingly dominant threat to ocean wildlife over the
next 150 years. [. . . ] Human dependency on marine wildlife and the linked
fate of marine and terrestrial fauna necessitate that we act quickly to slow the
advance of marine defaunation.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Unresolved commons problems even led to the collapse of whole societies
throughout human history. As far as we know today, examples are the Greenland
Norse, Easter Island, the Polynesians of Pitcairn Island, the Anasazi of southwest-
ern North America and the Maya of Central America. There are, of course, always
several factors that contribute to the collapse of a society, but overexploitation of
natural resources plays a very prominent role.
</p>
<p>Markets are only sufficient, not necessary, to reach efficiency. Humans have de-
veloped other effective means to cope with commons problems and property rights
plus trade, interestingly, is not one of the most common forms of resource man-
agement, as is stressed by Elinor Ostrom who systematically analyzed solutions to
the commons problem in different societies. She came to the conclusion that the
absence of private property and markets need not be an impediment to the efficient
and sustainable use of common goods. On the contrary, evidence suggests that well-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>136 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>maintained systems of resource and ecosystem management can, in fact, yield better
results than markets can. These findings are of considerable importance for the way
one should think about institutions, because they point towards the blind spots of
the standard model in economics, which puts (too?) much emphasis on markets.
What makes Ostrom&rsquo;s findings difficult to integrate into this discussion about com-
mon goods is, however, a tension between this definition of common goods and the
way she uses the term. This book defines them by the &ldquo;technological&rdquo; property of
non-excludability, which excludes certain institutions by definition. Ostrom (2005)
starts from a different perspective, focusing on goods and resources for which com-
mon property exists de facto. The set of admissible institutions, therefore, remains
unclear and some of her criteria for successful institutional principles show that they
rely on excludability. With this caveat, one can briefly discuss the basic principles
of successful management of common goods that have been identified.
</p>
<p>� Pretty much in line with the standard model, precise delineations of the resources
and effective exclusion of externals is important. Hence, even if exclusion is not
practiced within the group, it is important to exclude outsiders.
</p>
<p>� One needs rules regarding the appropriation and provision of the common goods
and these rules have to be adapted to local conditions. This property shows that
institutional diversity is key, because there are close ties between the norms and
cultures of groups and the environment.
</p>
<p>� Rules for collective decision-making play an important role by giving voice to as
many users of the common resource as possible and allowing the management
system to adapt to changing environmental and social conditions.
</p>
<p>� Monitors maintain compliance effective and are part of or are accountable to the
users.
</p>
<p>� One needs a scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators, who violate
community rules.
</p>
<p>� One needs mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and are easily acces-
sible for the conflicting parties.
</p>
<p>� The self-determination of the community is recognized by higher-level authori-
ties.
</p>
<p>This list shows that institutions, which can effectively manage common goods, are
diverse, but share common patterns. One-size-fits-all solutions that rely on prop-
erty rights and markets should, therefore, be considered with caution, because they
are only one means to cope with commons problems and may even be maladapted
to local norms and traditions. However, given that the above principles have been
identified in mostly stable and small communities, it remains an unresolved ques-
tion whether they can be &ldquo;scaled up&rdquo; to cope with large or even global commons
problems. Trust and sanctions are relatively easy to establish in small and stable
communities and small-scale communities are also the environments in which hu-
man beings evolved and developed their intuitions about fairness and justice. A
suggestion about how to deal with larger common-goods problems, which comes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.3 Four Boundary Cases 137
</p>
<p>out of this line of research, is to organize them in the form of multiple layers of
nested organizational units.
</p>
<p>Club goods If exclusion is possible and the good is non-rival, then it is a club
good. The name sounds strange at first, but it will become clear as I discuss the
implications of this combination of factors. Think of a live music concert or sports
event. In order to be able to enjoy it, one has to enter a stadium or concert hall and
this physical barrier can be used to exercise exclusion and to force one to buy an
entrance ticket. Further examples for club goods are Pay TV, lectures, music and
software or &ndash; to a certain extent &ndash; roads. I will briefly discuss them, to see if there
are interesting patterns to be found.
</p>
<p>Lectures at universities, for example, are pretty much like live music and sports
events club goods, because one can, in principle, exclude people from attending and
thereby enforce the payment of prices. These prices are sometimes also called en-
trance or user fees. Moreover, if the primary motive for attending lectures is a grade
certificate, one can enforce the payment of user fees by withholding the certificate.
Given that exclusion is possible, in principle, it is mainly a political decision of
whether access should be regulated by the price mechanism and whether it shall
be complemented by other mechanisms (like making a high-school degree manda-
tory). A lot of public universities in Europe charge only moderate or no tuition
fees, whereas private universities and also public universities in countries like the
USA charge substantial amounts. MIT, for example, charged its undergraduate stu-
dents $45,016 annually (2014/15), which is pretty much in line with other top US
universities. The University of Cambridge (for its undergraduate computer science
program) discriminates tuition fees between UK and EU and other international
students and the fees are &pound;9,000 and &pound;22,923 for both groups, respectively.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of lectures, music and sports is that the &ldquo;live event&rdquo; has a limited
reach defined by the capacity of the lecture room, concert hall or stadium. There-
fore, the maximum supply is defined by this capacity. To make sure that supply
meets demand, one can rely on the price mechanism, adjusting user fees accord-
ingly or one can use alternative rationing schemes. Universities, for example, screen
students by means of entrance tests, and so on.
</p>
<p>Why is there a difference in the way demand is rationed between, for example,
music events and university programs? Profit-oriented universities face a tradeoff
between short- and long-term profits. Assume that, at given tuition fees, demand
exceeds supply, such that entrance tests must be used to ration. In the short run,
the university could increase its revenues by increasing tuition fees, but this may
have a negative impact on the selection of the student body, which may have a
negative effect on the future reputation of the university, which &ndash; as the last step in
a complex causal chain &ndash; has a negative effect on future entrance fees. This is not
the case with other commercial events, like concerts and sports, because the talents
and motivation of the audience has only a very limited effect on the quality of the
event.
</p>
<p>One has already seen that live events face certain capacity constraints, which
limits the reach of a club good. These limitations can, in principle, be overcome by</p>

<p>138 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>&ldquo;going digital.&rdquo; Broadcasting sports events or live music and selling studio music
via, for example, iTunes markedly extended the reach of these goods such that, at
the maximum, everyone with access to the internet can get access to the product,
which creates huge profit potentials for firms. However, every distribution chan-
nel has its own enforcement costs and the music industry had to learn this the hard
way during the early days of the internet, when it was almost impossible to prevent
illegal downloads. Thus, digital products somehow oscillate between the charac-
teristics of a club good and a public good. &ldquo;Going digital&rdquo; is also a recent trend in
education, where so-called MOOC&rsquo;s (massive open online courses) are mushroom-
ing.
</p>
<p>Last, but not least, roads are an example of a good for which regulating access
via price mechanisms is becoming increasingly popular, partly because of changes
in the available technologies of exclusion, and partly because of other trends. Ac-
cess to most roads in the majority of countries is free and traffic infrastructure is
financed by taxes. One of the reasons is that road pricing and the investments in
the setup and maintenance of the necessary exclusion technology is very costly in
general. Furthermore, there is a lot of evidence that, as long as congestion is not an
issue, a region&rsquo;s traffic infrastructure creates huge positive externalities, because it
facilitates trade. For example, Paris experienced a boost in its economic develop-
ment after the abolishment of bridge tolls by Baron Haussmann in the 19th century.
However, positive externalities caused by traffic infrastructure can easily be com-
pensated by negative externalities, if traffic gets congested. The current trend to
(re-)introduce tolls on highways, bridges and other major roads is, to a certain ex-
tent, a reaction to the increasing economic costs of congested traffic infrastructure,
combined with more efficient technologies for the enforcement and collection of
tolls that bring down the transaction costs of enforcing fees.
</p>
<p>If one looks at club goods from a slightly different angle, one observes an in-
teresting property because, as long as no capacity constraints are binding (there
are still empty seats in the lecture room), an additional user of the good causes no
additional costs. This property has two interesting implications.
</p>
<p>First, from an efficiency perspective, it makes sense to increase the number of
users to the largest extent possible, because each additional user increases the gains
from trade (no additional costs, but additional consumer surplus). It follows that
actually excluding people from using the club good can never be efficient. Exclu-
sion is a mechanism that can be used to establish a market and, therefore, has to
be distinguished from the act of actually excluding people. The threat of exclusion
makes the enforcement of prices (like tolls or tuition fees) possible, but it depends
on the actual prices whether potential users will be excluded or not.
</p>
<p>Second, the fact that firms can serve additional customers at approximately zero
additional costs creates a tendency towards the monopolization of markets for club
goods. Take software as an example. From the point of view of a software devel-
oper, the lion&rsquo;s share of the costs she has to invest is caused by the development of
the product. As soon as the product is on the market, each additional user causes
approximately zero additional costs. Hence, the more users there are the better, for
the software developer. The fact that the minimum price that is necessary to break</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.3 Four Boundary Cases 139
</p>
<p>even falls as the number of users increases creates an inherent tendency for market
concentration: firms with larger market shares can outcompete their smaller com-
petitors, because they can charge lower prices without running a deficit. This is the
reason why club goods are sometimes also called natural monopolies. I will come
back to this point when I discuss production costs in Chap. 8 and monopoly pricing
in Chap. 10.
</p>
<p>Public goods The last type of good is non-rival in consumption and exclusion is
impossible. If exclusion is impossible, markets cannot be used to incentivize the
production and allocation of these goods, so one has to look for alternative ways to
organize economic activity.
</p>
<p>Examples for public goods are fireworks, basic research, national defense, avoid-
ance of climate change and legal systems, and the following paragraphs will discuss
all five examples in turn. Fireworks are an example for a (local or regional) public
good, because no one in a city can be effectively excluded from the spectacle and it
is also non-rival. Arguably, the other examples are more important than fireworks.
</p>
<p>Basic research is non-rival, because the fact that I understand a mathematical
theorem does not make it impossible for another person to understand it, as well.
All knowledge, in this sense, is non-rival. The difference between basic and applied
research is, therefore, not the degree to which goods are rival, but the ability to
exclude. Applied research usually builds on basic research and &ldquo;brings it to the
market.&rdquo; A good example is quantum physics. Without quantum mechanics, there
would be no transistor and hence no personal computer and no laser. Therefore,
the development of quantum mechanics made the development of a large number
of products possible, without which today&rsquo;s world would be impossible. Products
or components thereof, like transistors or computers, can be effectively protected
by patent law. However, the protection of property rights for the mathematical
formulation of quantum physics, like the Schr&ouml;dinger equation or the uncertainty
principle, is not as easy to do. Even if a formal property right exists, one cannot
sell the Schr&ouml;dinger equation directly and it is, in general, very hard to establish
a causal link between abstract physical principles and marketable goods, such that
potential property-rights infringements would be hard to detect.
</p>
<p>The public-goods character of basic research requires alternatives to the market
mechanism and one can find essentially two different ways to organize the pro-
duction process. One is public financing. Major resources for basic research at
universities and research institutions are provided by the state and financed by taxes,
and career incentives for scientists have the form of a contest, where the relatively
most successful qualify for professorships and research money. The alternative is
to interpret education and research as complementary bundles where basic research
is, at least partly, financed by tuition fees and students profit indirectly from the
direct access to a research-intensive environment, because new ideas disseminate
earlier, which gives them a competitive edge in developing new, marketable prod-
ucts. A good example is the synergistic relationship between Stanford University
and Silicon Valley startups and companies.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>140 6 Externalities and the Limits of Markets
</p>
<p>A staple example for public goods is national defense. It is relatively obvious
that, within certain geographic limits, a military of a given size provides a non-rival
service to its citizens. By its very nature, the reach of national defense is the people
living within the territory of a nation state (protecting people living abroad is much
more difficult). The non-excludability of national defense becomes apparent, if one
distinguishes between an actual military conflict and the insurance against attacks
provided by the military. In case of an act of aggression, exclusion of specific
citizens is, in principle, possible. One could escort them to the border and hand them
over to the enemy. However, it is virtually impossible to exclude people within the
territory from the insurance provided by the existence of the military, which results
from the fact that one is not attacked at first place.
</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the avoidance of climate change has important properties of
a truly global public good: CO2 emissions have global effects on the climate, so
measures to slow down climate change cause non-rival effects. Similarly, no one
can be excluded from the effects of climate change (or the effects from slowing it
down). The global nature of climate change is what makes the problem so difficult
to solve. The expected costs and benefits of climate change are unevenly distributed
between countries and regions and international negotiations take place within the
holey network of international law. International agreements are difficult to reach
and they are even more difficult to enforce. If one would ask a group of social
scientists and psychologists to design a problem that is hard to solve for human
beings, I am pretty sure that it would look very much like climate change.
</p>
<p>L The last example for a public good that I will discuss is the legal system of a
country, because it allows one to focus one&rsquo;s attention on the fact that excludability
need not be a physical characteristic of a good. The legal system of a country is
clearly nonrival. If A uses contract law to set up contracts, it does not impede B
from using the contract law himself. Things get more complex when it comes to
excludability. Technically, it is no problem to exclude people from contract law
because the courts could decide not to apply it to contracts signed by specific peo-
ple. However, contract law is embedded within the rest of the legal system, which
makes such restrictions illegal. It can (and, in practice, usually does) specify that
all laws apply equally to all citizens of a country. Such a norm creates a legal non-
excludability and the system depends on levels of analysis to determine whether
such constraints are taken as a given or if they are subject to scrutiny.

<p>Part III
</p>
<p>Foundations of Demand and Supply
</p>
<p>So far, I have motivated the structure and interpretation of the individual supply
functions heuristically. I have argued that it is plausible that the supply of a good
increases with its price and decreases with the prices of the inputs that are used
for its production. I have argued that it is plausible that a point along the supply
function can be interpreted as the willingness to sell this particular unit and the
area between the market price and the supply curve can be interpreted as a measure
for the gains from trade the firm is able to appropriate. By the same token, I have
argued that it is plausible that the demand of a good decreases with its price.
</p>
<p>This approach was a good first approximation, because it allows one to discuss
the functioning of markets without large detours into the bits and pieces of firm
decision making. However, it has (opportunity) costs (as one should know by now)
as well, because it leads one no further than the current point. One&rsquo;s understand-
ing of the demand and supply curve, the interpretation of consumer and producer
surplus and the functioning of markets remain necessarily limited as long as one
does not move on and look for a deeper understanding of how decisions are made
by consumers and within firms.
</p>
<p>This is the purpose of the following chapters. Remember that microeconomics is
the study of decision making in households and firms and their interactions. Thus,
according to this paradigm, the understanding of individual decision making must
be at the core of one&rsquo;s discipline and the field that specializes on decisions is called
decision theory. Models of decision making have two building blocks:
</p>
<p>� They have to specify a set of alternatives, from which a decision maker can
choose.
</p>
<p>� They have to specify an objective function of the decision maker that specifies a
ranking of the alternatives and a motivational assumption, which allows one to
make predictions about the alternative she or he will choose, if confronted with
a set of alternatives.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>144
</p>
<p>This specification is very generic and can be applied to all kinds of decision prob-
lems, ranging from demand decisions of consumers, to supply decisions of firms to
voting behavior in elections.
</p>
<p>The above approach allows one to develop a road map for the endeavor to more
deeply understand demand and supply decisions: one first has to specify the set
of alternatives from which a firm can choose. Afterwards, one has to specify the
objectives of consumers and firms and bring those two building blocks together
in order to derive hypotheses about consumer and firm behavior (i.e. demand and
supply decisions).
</p>
<p>From the point of view of a consumers, admissible alternatives are those con-
sumption bundles that are affordable given prices and income. Economists assume
that consumers can rank the affordable consumption bundles according to their
tastes or preferences, and it is assumed that they try to select the best consump-
tion bundle available. The formal model that allows to cope with decisions like
these is introduced and analyzed in Chap. 7 where we will in a first step introduce
the general preference model that will in a second step applied to the problem of
consumer choice in competitive markets.
</p>
<p>The set of alternatives from which a firm can choose is, as one will see, in-
fluenced by the costs it faces. I will, therefore, continue with an analysis of the
different types of costs (Chap. 8). With a thorough understanding of the determi-
nants and structures of costs, one can then go back to goods markets and see how
they can be linked with objectives of the firm to better understand supply decisions.
In order to do so, I assume that firms want to maximize profits (there will be more
about this assumption in Chap. 8). Then I will return to the competitive environ-
ment to have a second look at firm behavior under perfect competition (Chap. 9).
Costs will also be a crucial building block for firm behavior in monopolistic and
oligopolistic markets that are analyzed in Chaps. 10 and 12.
</p>
<p>The decision-theoretic perspective makes it possible to turn to the managerial
perspective in greater detail. Chapters 9, 10 and 12 will move back and forth be-
tween a more &ldquo;economic&rdquo; perspective, which focuses on the functioning of markets,
and a &ldquo;management&rdquo; perspective, wich focuses on the decisions firms have to make
in order to be successful in certain market environments, the information that is
needed to make these decisions and the implications for the internal organization of
the firm. Economics and business administration cannot be dealt with separately.
Economists can only understand the functioning of markets, if they understand
how managers make decisions, and managers can only make sound decisions if
they understand the market context in which they act. Economics and business ad-
ministration are, therefore, complementary and an in-depth exchange between both
disciplines can only be fruitful for both of them.</p>

<p>7Decisions and Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>This chapter covers . . .
</p>
<p>� the concepts of preferences and utility functions and how these are related.
� how the assumption that individuals maximize preferences can be used to deter-
</p>
<p>mine the individual demand functions on a competitive market.
� the strengths and weaknesses of this approach as a foundation of choice and
</p>
<p>decision-making in general and the structure of demand functions specifically.
</p>
<p>7.1 Basic Concepts
</p>
<p>The theory of Economics must begin with a correct theory of consumption. (William Stan-
ley Jevons)
</p>
<p>Individual and market demand are the consequences of decisions made by individ-
uals. Until now I have taken a shortcut and skipped a more detailed analysis of the
way individuals make decisions, because I wanted to keep the focus on the func-
tioning of markets. For that purpose, it was sufficient to heuristically explain how
prices, income and other factors influence demand. However, this shortcut&rsquo;s cost is
preventing one from developing a deeper understanding of the structure of individ-
ual and market demand. Additionally, the way I related the idea of Pareto efficiency
and the demand function was also pretty clumsy.
</p>
<p>Reduced to its essential core, economic decision theory is very simple: one
assumes that individuals choose the best alternative from a set of admissible alter-
natives. In a market context, the admissible alternatives are the goods and services
a consumer can afford, given prices and income. It is more difficult to model the
meaning of individuals choosing the best alternative, though. This chapter is de-
voted to making these ideas precise and to seeing how they can help us to gain a
better understanding of market behavior and of behavior in general.

<p>146 7 Decisions and Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>7.1.1 Choice Sets and Preferences
</p>
<p>In order to develop✍ a decision theory, one needs two conceptual ingredients. First,
a set of alternatives from which an individual can choose. Call it a choice set and
denote it by X D fx1; x2; : : :; xng, in which xi ; i D 1; : : :; n is one of the possible
alternatives and assume, for simplicity, that the total number of alternatives n is
finite. The idea of a choice set is very general. If one goes to a caf&eacute;, one&rsquo;s choice
set is a subset of all of the items on the menu. This implies that an alternative can
be a list of individual items, like &ldquo;one cup of tea, two scones and one portion of
orange jam.&rdquo; Mathematically speaking, this type of list is called a tuple. If xi is the
above-mentioned alternative, it could be denoted as xi D fquantity of tea, number
of scones, quantity of orange jamg D f1; 2; 1g. If one goes to vote, one&rsquo;s choice set
is the set of all admissible parties or candidates and if one is deciding what to do
after high school, one&rsquo;s choice set is the set of all potential professions.
</p>
<p>Second, the individual may prefer some alternatives to others, which is an ex-
pression of her taste or preferences. Assume that she is able to make pairwise
comparisons of all the alternatives in X to make statements like, &ldquo;I prefer alterna-
tive xi to alternative xj ,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am indifferent between alternative xi and alternative
xj .&rdquo; In order to have a lean notation, economists use the following symbols for
these statements: &ldquo;I prefer alternative xi to alternative xj &rdquo; is denoted by &ldquo;xi � xj &rdquo;
and &ldquo;I am indifferent between alternative xi and alternative xj &rdquo; by &ldquo;xi � xj .&rdquo;
</p>
<p>It is important to understand✍ the exact meaning of the terminology. Mathemati-
cally speaking, I am taking two arbitrary elements of X , xi and xj , and comparing
them to each other. This comparison is called a binary relation on X . The strict
preference relation, &ldquo;�,&rdquo; and the indifference relation, &ldquo;�,&rdquo; can therefore be de-
noted as a subset of the Cartesian product of X , X � X . (I am slightly abusing the
notation by using the symbols as names for both the relation and for indicating the
binary comparison of alternatives.)
</p>
<p>Here is an example: assume that Ann can choose between an apple, x1, an
orange, x2, and a cherry, x3. In this case, the choice set is equal to X D
fx1; x2; x3g and the Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs X � X D
f.x1; x1/; .x1; x2/; .x1; x3/; .x2; x1/; .x2; x2/; .x2; x3/; .x3; x1/; .x3; x2/; .x3; x3/g.
Assume that Ann prefers apples to oranges and is indifferent between oranges and
cherries, x1 � x2, x2 � x3. If one reads a pair .xi ; xj / as &ldquo;xi stands in relation R
to xj ,&rdquo; one can represent her preferences, &ldquo;�,&rdquo; by the subset of pairs f.x1; x2/g and
her preferences, &ldquo;�,&rdquo; by the subset of pairs f.x1; x1/; .x2; x2/; .x2; x3/; .x3; x3/g.
Note that the pairs .xi ; xi / are elements of the subset, because Ann is indifferent
between an alternative and itself. This property is not self-evident from a purely
mathematical point of view and, therefore, sometimes is stated as an assumption of
the preference relation that is known as reflexivity.
</p>
<p>As stated, relation &ldquo;�&rdquo; is✍ called the strict preference relation and relation � the
indifference relation. It turns out that it is easier to work with a third type of relation
that is called the weak preference relation, which is denoted by &ldquo;%.&rdquo; It contains all of
the pairs from X�X that either belong to the strict preference or the indifference re-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.1 Basic Concepts 147
</p>
<p>lation. In this example, it is the set f.x1; x1/; .x1; x2/; .x2; x2/; .x2; x3/; .x3; x3/g.
The strict preference and indifference relations can easily be reconstructed from the
weak preference relation by the following operations:
</p>
<p>� (xi � xj / , .xi % xj / ^ :.xj % xi /,
� (xi � xj / , .xi % xj / ^ .xj % xi /,
</p>
<p>in which ^ and : stand for the logical operations &ldquo;and&rdquo; and &ldquo;not.&rdquo;
In order for the concepts to have predictive power, one has to make additional
</p>
<p>assumptions on the structure of the weak preference relation.
</p>
<p>I Assumption 7.1 (Completeness) For every xi ; xj 2 X , either xi % xj or xj %
xi or both are true.
</p>
<p>Assumption 1 implies that the individual can compare any two pairs of alter-
natives. This assumption may sound innocuous, because it seems obvious that one
should either be better off with one alternative or the other. However, critiques point
out that, depending on the context, alternatives can exist that cannot be compared
in a meaningful way. Think, for example, of the alternative &ldquo;destruction of human
life by means of nuclear weapons&rdquo; and &ldquo;destruction of human life by means of a
lethal virus.&rdquo; It is argued that there is a meaningful difference between being indif-
ferent between two alternatives and not being able to compare them. If one has to
choose between alternatives whose consequences are beyond our imagination, it is
not clear that an inability to compare and an indifference are the same.
</p>
<p>I Assumption 7.2 (Transitivity) For every xi ; xj ; xk 2 X , if xi % xj and xj % xk ,
then xi % xk .
</p>
<p>Transitivity implies that there are no &ldquo;cycles&rdquo; in the relation. The main jus-
tification for this assumption stems from the so-called &ldquo;money-pump&rdquo; argument,
which rests on the idea that a person with intransitive preferences can be exploited
by some other person. In order to understand this, assume that there is a &ldquo;cycle&rdquo;
xi � xj � xk � xi and that the individual is willing to pay at least one cent for the
next best alternative. In that case, she would be willing to give up xi plus a small
amount of money in exchange for xk , xk plus a small amount of money in exchange
for xj and &ndash; attention money pump &ndash; xj plus a small amount of money in exchange
for xi . Now she is back where she started, with the exception that the individual has
lost three cents. Continuing this process would, in the end, separate the individual
from all her money.
</p>
<p>However, a lot of empirical experiments have shown that transitivity cannot be
taken for granted. Here is an example. Procrastination describes the tendency to
delay uncomfortable duties until later. A tendency to procrastinate may have very
adverse consequences and the intransitivity of inter-temporal preferences seems to
be playing an important role. This is why: assume that it is Monday and you have
a report due on Thursday. Overall, you would like to hand in a high-quality report.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>148 7 Decisions and Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>However, starting to work on Monday is less preferable to starting to work on Tues-
day (&ldquo;you know, I had a stressful day anyway&rdquo;). However, when Tuesday comes,
it is preferable to delay and start working on Wednesday (&ldquo;I need the pressure to
get things done&rdquo;). However, from Wednesday&rsquo;s perspective it seems better to delay
another day (&ldquo;well, I simply cannot do it&rdquo;). However, on Thursday it is too late to
prepare and hand in a report of decent quality.
</p>
<p>A weak preference relation✍ that fulfills Assumptions 1 and 2 is also called
a preference ordering. What do they imply in this little example? One al-
ready knows that Ann&rsquo;s preferences are x1 % x2 (because x1 � x2 and % is
a weaker condition than �) and x2 % x3 (because x2 � x3 and % is weaker
than �). Completeness is guaranteed by assumption (there are only three al-
ternatives in the example) and transitivity implies that one can infer x1 % x3
</p>
<p>from x1 % x2 % x3. Hence, the completed preference ordering is given by
f.x1; x1/; .x1; x2/; .x1; x3/; .x2; x2/; .x2; x3/; .x3; x3/g.
</p>
<p>Completeness and transitivity are usually taken for granted in almost all eco-
nomic applications. However, depending on the specific context that is analyzed
additional assumptions have to be imposed. I list three of them in the following
paragraphs.
</p>
<p>I Assumption 7.3 (Continuity) For any xi 2 X the set of all xj 2 X is such that
xi % xj and the set of all xk 2 X is such that xk % xi are closed sets in X .
</p>
<p>Continuity is less obvious from an economic point of view, but it still has some
intuitive plausibility. It implies that the preference relation does not &ldquo;jump&rdquo; in the
following sense. Assume that an individual is comparing two alternatives, x1 and
x2, and she weakly prefers x1 to x2, x1 % x2. For example, if one modifies x1 a
tiny bit to x1 C �, in which � is a very small quantity, then the preference ordering
does not suddenly reverse, x1 % x2 ) x1 C � % x2.
</p>
<p>I Assumption 7.4 (Monotonicity) For any xi ; xj 2 X , xi � xj and xi 6D xj
implies that xi � xj .
</p>
<p>Assumption 4 needs a few words of clarification. The specification of X is
completely general: elements can be arbitrarily complex or very simple alterna-
tives. However, in some cases the alternatives can be quantitatively measured and
compared, for example the quantity of a good like milk. In that case, xi could
be two liters of milk and xj one liter. In all of these cases, an expression like
&ldquo;xi � xj ^ xi 6D xj &rdquo; makes sense. It makes no sense, however, to compare
smartphones with ice cream. Assumption 4 is, therefore, only applicable for those
alternatives that can be measured and quantified on an absolute scale. It then implies
that the individual prefers larger quantities to smaller quantities.
</p>
<p>I Assumption 7.5a (Convexity) For any xi ; xj 2 X , such that xi % xj and for all
t W 0 � t � 1, it follows that t � xi C .1 � t/ � xj % xj .</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.1 Basic Concepts 149
</p>
<p>I Assumption 7.5b (Strict Convexity) For any xi ; xj 2 X , such that xi � xj and
for all t W 0 &lt; t &lt; 1, it follows that t � xi C .1 � t/ � xj � xi .
</p>
<p>Assumptions 7.5a and 7.5b are similar in spirit. What they imply is that individ-
uals prefer balanced over extreme alternatives. However, in order to illustrate this
idea, one has to restrict one&rsquo;s attention to the alternatives that are quantifiable and
measurable in the same way as one has assumed in Assumption 7.4.
</p>
<p>Assumptions 7.5a and 7.5b will play an important role in the theory of consumer
choice on competitive markets, which is why it makes sense to discuss them in
greater detail. Assume that the alternatives from which the individual can choose
are quantities of two different goods, like bread and water. Denote two alternatives
by x1 D f10; 0g and x2 D f0; 10g. In alternative 1 the individual gets 10 units of
water and no bread, while in alternative 2 she gets no water and 10 units of bread. In
this example, convexity as well as strict convexity imply that an individual would,
for example, prefer the more balanced alternative x3 D 0:5 � x1 C 0:5 � x2 D .5; 5/
to the extreme ones.
</p>
<p>In the example, Assumptions 7.5a and 7.5b seem to make perfect sense, but
looking at the alternative example, in which the first good is Miso soup and the
second is vanilla ice cream, few people would like to eat them together.
</p>
<p>The above assumptions are usually not all imposed simultaneously. As the theory
of consumer choice on competitive markets will show, economists try to establish
properties of choice behavior with minimal assumptions about preferences, because
every additional assumption constrains the admissible behavior of individuals, thus
making the theory less general.
</p>
<p>One can now define the concept of rationality as used in economics. It has two
different aspects. First, if individuals have a preference ordering, a well-defined
subset of alternatives Xo � X exists that defines the best or optimal alternatives
given the preferences. This would not necessarily be the case, if preferences were
not complete and transitive. Hence, a preference relation is called rational, if it
is complete and transitive. Second, it is not sufficient that individuals are able to
consistently order the alternatives according to their preferences; they must also act
according to them. Hence, individual behavior is rational, if the individual chooses
a best alternative given the choice set and the preference ordering. This idea of
rationality is at the heart of the concept of homo oeconomicus.
</p>
<p>I Definition 7.1 (Homo Oeconomicus) An individual behaves as homo oeconomi-
cus, if (i) she perceives a choice situation as a choice set X , (ii) has a preference
ordering over this choice set and (iii) chooses one of the best alternatives from this
choice set, given her preferences.
</p>
<p>Two statements are helpful to understand this. First, the concept of rationality is
purely instrumental. It only requires that the preferences are structured in a manner
that makes it possible to talk about better and worse alternatives in a meaningful
way and that individuals act according to their preferences. It does not scrutinize</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>150 7 Decisions and Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>the individual&rsquo;s taste or value judgments that caused her preferences. A debate
that allows one to distinguish between better and worse preference orderings would
build on a different concept of rationality, which is called value-based rationality.
Mainstream economists accept a philosophical position called subjectivism, a value
judgment that leads to an acceptance of all types of preference orderings. Second,
note that no such thing such as selfishness enters this definition of homo oeco-
nomicus. Selfishness is not an integral part of what economists consider rational
behavior, even though selfish behavior is added as an additional assumption in a lot
of analyses. The reason is that concepts such as selfish, altruistic, sadistic etc. pref-
erences refer to motives of action and, as I have just said, mainstream economists
do not scrutinize such motives but take them as given. It would, therefore, be alien
to the idea of instrumental rationality, if it required any specific motive to act. (See
Digression 3, Chap. 1, for a more detailed analysis of this topic.)
</p>
<p>In order to get started with an analysis of decision making, one needs a few more
concepts.
</p>
<p>I Definition 7.2 (Not-Worse-Than-x Set) The Not-Worse-Than-x Set, for an alter-
native x 2 X , NW.x/, is given by the set of all xi 2 X , such that xi % x.
</p>
<p>I Definition 7.3 (Not-Better-Than-xSet) The Not-Better-Than-x Set, for an alterna-
tive x 2 X , NB.x/, is given by the set of all xi 2 X , such that x % xi .
</p>
<p>I Definition 7.4 (Indifferent-To-x Set) The Indifferent-To-x Set, for an alternative
x 2 X , I.x/, is given by the intersection NW.x/\NB.x/.
</p>
<p>7.1.2 Indifference Curves
</p>
<p>Thus far, I have introduced the concept of a preference ordering in the simplistic
case of a finite set of alternatives X . However, the concepts can be readily gener-
alized to allow for infinitely many different alternatives, which is usually done if
the theory is applied to market contexts. In this case, if there are n different goods,
then the choice set is a subset of the n-dimensional set of positive real numbers,
X � RnC. In this case, one can illustrate the indifferent-to-x set by a graph. As-
sume that there are two goods whose quantities are represented by the two axes of
Fig. 7.1.
</p>
<p>The downward-sloping graph✍ represents the indifferent-to-x set for an alterna-
tive that one calls a consumption bundle Nx D . Nx1; Nx2/. It is called indifference
curve. Hence, Ann is indifferent between this consumption bundle and any other
consumption bundle on the indifference curve ( Qx D . Qx1; Qx2/ and Ox D . Ox1; Ox2/ are
two examples for such bundles in the figure), Nx � Qx � Ox. Please note that if the
curvature of this curve is representative for the whole preference ordering, &ldquo;%,&rdquo; then
the ordering is both convex and strictly convex. The continuity of the curve reveals
that preferences are continuous.</p>

</p>
<p>The indifference curve in Fig. 7.1, of course, only partially represents the individ-
ual&rsquo;s preference ordering. There exists an indifferent-to-x set for every consumption
bundle x that can in principle be represented by an indifference curve.
</p>
<p>The slope of an indifference curve has an important economic interpretation.
Suppose that one not only wants to reallocate the consumption goods but also wants
to ensure that the individual is neither better nor worse off. This is only possible
if one chooses consumption bundles that lie on the same indifference curve. Now,
suppose that at some point x one takes dx2 &lt; 0 away from the individual. Given
that the indifference curve is downward sloping, one has to compensate the individ-
ual by some extra quantity, dx1 &gt; 0, to ensure that one stays on the indifference
curve. See Fig. 7.2 for an illustration of this.
</p>
<p>If one looks at infinitesimal ✍changes, dx2 ! 0, then the exchange rate between
the two goods is given by the slope of the tangent to the indifference curve at the
point Nx. The absolute value of this exchange rate, dx2=dx1, is called the marginal
rate of substitution (MRS) between good 2 and good 1. It is an expression of the
idea of opportunity costs in the context of the individual&rsquo;s decision problem: if one
takes a little bit of one good away, how much of the other good does one have to
give the individual to make her indifferent?

</p>
<p>Figure 7.3a illustrates so-called perfect substitutes. Indifference curves are
straight, parallel lines. The outward-pointing arrow indicates that the individual
prefers larger quantities to smaller ones (monotonicity). If indifference curves are
straight lines, then the MRS is independent of the consumption bundle. This means
that the individual is always willing to substitute one good for the same quantity of
the other good, hence the name perfect substitutes. Whether two goods are perfect
substitutes to each other or not ultimately depends on the perception of the individ-
ual, but plausible examples are different brands of toothpaste, yoghurt, shoes, etc.
Perfect substitutes are preference orderings that fulfill continuity, monotony and
convexity, but not strict convexity.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.3b illustrates so-called perfect complements. Indifference curves are
L-shaped with a kink. L-shaped indifference curves imply that the individual wants
to consume the two goods in a fixed ratio. This fixed ratio is given by the slope of
the straight line through the origin that connects the kinks. Examples could be left
and right shoes (which is why they are sold as pairs), computer hard- and software,
coffee and cream, etc. Perfect complements are preference orderings that fulfill
continuity, monotony and convexity, but not strict convexity.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.3c illustrates strictly convex preferences. Indifference curves bend in-
wards, but not as extremely as it does for perfect complements. Perfectly convex
preferences are somewhere in between perfect substitutes and perfect complements.
An individual with such preferences is willing to substitute one good for the other,
but has a ceteris paribus preference for more balanced bundles.
</p>
<p>Finally, Fig. 7.3d illustrates another type of strictly convex preferences, however,
with a point of saturation. As the arrows indicate, such preferences are not mono-
tonic, because a globally optimal consumption bundle exists. If consumption falls
short of this point, then increasing it makes the individual better off. If consumption</p>

Preferences like these are plausible in situations in which goods are not storable and
there are physical limits to consumption. Think of ice cream as an example: the first
scoop is very good, the second still good, the third is ok, but a fourth, fifth, or sixth
scoop makes you sick. It is important to note, however, that if it were possible to
produce goods in quantities such that individuals are on or beyond their points of
satiation (and the excess can be freely disposed of), society would have overcome
scarcity. Hence, the assumption that economics is the science that studies the al-
location of scare goods and services implies that one implicitly assumes that one
is not beyond these points of satiation, either because no such points exist (mono-
tonicity), or because our technological means to production are insufficient to reach
these points for all goods in X . In this latter case, however, the indifference curves
in Fig. 7.3d look qualitatively similar to the indifference curves in Fig. 7.3c.</p>

<p>154 7 Decisions and Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>7.1.3 Utility Functions
</p>
<p>The decision problem✍ of an individual can be completely analyzed by the use of
the concept of preference orderings. However, it has turned out that it is sometimes
more convenient to represent an ordering by a function, because it allows one to
use different and more standard tools from mathematics. This kind of a functional
representation of a preference ordering is called a utility function. This subchapter
will first introduce the concept and then describe some of the potential pitfalls and
misunderstandings that come with it.
</p>
<p>Economists use the following convention when they represent preference order-
ings by a function u.x/, in which x refers to an arbitrary alternative that can itself
be a tuple. They assume that the function assigns a larger number to strictly pre-
ferred alternatives, xi � xj , u.xi / &gt; u.xj /, and the same number to indifferent
alternatives, xi � xj , u.xi / D u.xj /. Any function that meets these require-
ments qualifies as a utility representation, u.x/, of a preference ordering &ldquo;%.&rdquo; More
formally, this means:
</p>
<p>I Definition 7.5 (Utility Function) A function u W X ! R is called a utility function
for a preference ordering &ldquo;%&rdquo; if and only if xi � xj , u.xi/ &gt; u.xj / and
xi � xj , u.xi / D u.xj / for all xi ; xj 2 X .
</p>
<p>This definition of a utility representation or function leaves a lot of freedom when
assigning numbers to alternatives or, to put it differently, a given preference order-
ing has not only one utility representation but many. Here is an example: assume
that an individual must choose from a choice set X D fx1; x2; x3g and has pref-
erences x1 � x2 � x3. In this case, the following three assignments of numbers
to alternatives uA; uB ; uC are all utility representations of this preference ordering:
uA W uA.x1/ D 3; uA.x2/ D 2; uA.x3/ D 1, uB W uB.x1/ D 354; uB.x2/ D
7:65; uB.x
</p>
<p>3/ D 0, uC W uC .x1/ D �1; uC .x2/ D �2; uC .x3/ D �3. How-
ever, Function D does not represent the preference ordering: uD W uD.x1/ D
3; uD.x
</p>
<p>2/ D 1; uD.x3/ D 2, because it assigns a larger number to the worst al-
ternative x3 rather than to the second-best alternative x2 (2 compared to 1).
</p>
<p>An implication of this definition of a utility function is that the absolute values
that it assigns to alternatives are meaningless. By the same token, the differences
in utility levels for different alternatives are meaningless, as well. The only thing
that counts is that preferred alternatives are assigned larger numbers. This is why
it is called an ordinal concept (absolute values and cardinal differences have no
economic meaning).
</p>
<p>An immediate implication of this concept is summarized with the following re-
sult: assume that u W X ! R is a utility representation of preference ordering &ldquo;%&rdquo;
and assume that f W R ! R is a monotonic and increasing function. In that case,
the composite function v D f ı u is also a utility representation of &ldquo;%.&rdquo; In order
to show this, I assume that u W X ! R is a utility representation of &ldquo;%,&rdquo; which
implies, by the definition of a utility function, that
</p>
<p>u.xi/ &gt; u.xj / , xi � xj ^ u.xi/ D u.xj / , xi � xj :</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.1 Basic Concepts 155
</p>
<p>If f .x/ is a monotonic increasing function, then one knows that
</p>
<p>f .u.xi // &gt; f .u.xj // , u.xi/ &gt; u.xj / ^
f .u.xi // D f .u.xj // , u.xi/ D u.xj /:
</p>
<p>However, this implies that
</p>
<p>f .u.xi // &gt; f .u.xj // , xi � xj ^ f .u.xi // D f .u.xj // , xi � xj ;
</p>
<p>And, thereby, that
</p>
<p>v.xi / &gt; v.xj / , xi � xj ^ v.xi / D v.xj / , xi � xj :
</p>
<p>The transfer from preference orderings to utility functions bears some risk of misin-
terpretation. Because utility functions assign numbers to alternatives, it is tempting
to use these numbers and perform all types of operations with them, like calculating
differences (u.xi/ D 10; u.xj / D 7, hence u.xi/ � u.xj / D 10 � 7 D 3 and thus
the individual must be three units better off) and comparing them between differ-
ent individuals (individual A has 8 units of utility, whereas individual B only has
3 units, which makes individual A 5 units better off than individual B). These cal-
culations are mathematically well defined, but economically meaningless, because
absolute values of utility or differences in utilities have no meaning if the underly-
ing, primary concept is a preference ordering. What remains, however meaningful,
is the marginal rate of substitution MRS , because it is independent of the exact util-
ity representation used. To see this, return to the two representations used above,
u.x/ and v.x/ D f .u.x//, and use the following notation: alternative xi consists
of the quantities xi1 and x

</p>
<p>preference ordering. Hence, the MRS is an economically meaningful concept,
because it is a property of the preference ordering, which itself is an explanatory
element of the theory.
</p>
<p>Digression 17. What Do Preferences and Utility Functions Stand for? The Devel-
</p>
<p>opment of the Modern Concept of Preference Orderings
</p>
<p>The view on the concept of utility has gone through substantial changes over
the past 100 years or so. What unifies all interpretations is the assumption
that individual behavior is somehow related to individual well-being. Ini-
tially, economists used the term utility as a proxy for what is called hedonic
well-being. This position was put forward by utilitarian philosophers, like
Jeremy Bentham or John Stuart Mill. Mill wrote: &ldquo;The creed which accepts as
the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest-Happiness Principle, holds
that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong
as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended
pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of
pleasure.&rdquo; Therefore, these philosophers had a specific understanding of what
is now called the theory of mind and a substantive claim as to what promotes
happiness: feeling good. Both the brain and the mind were conceptualized as
pleasure- and pain-generating machines and these feelings were considered
to be the exclusive motivators for behavior. According to this view, a utility
function is a measure for hedonic pleasure (higher utility = more (pleasure mi-
nus pain), lower utility = less (pleasure minus pain)) and &ndash; together with the
assumption that pleasure motivates behavior &ndash; is therefore a highly stylized
theory of mind. This view of utility was pretty much in line with the lead-
ing paradigm of psychology of the time. Psychologists like Gustav Theodor
Fechner or Wilhelm Wundt were convinced that mental processes could be
measured and compared.
</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, however, this view was increasingly scrutinized.
The idea that mental phenomena could be measured was mocked as &ldquo;meta-
physical hocus pocus,&rdquo; the paradigm in psychology shifted towards what is
today called behaviorism and economics followed swiftly. One of the main
proponents was Vilfredo Pareto, who wrote in a letter in 1897: &ldquo;It is an empir-
ical fact that the natural sciences have progressed only when they have taken
secondary principles as their point of departure, instead of trying to discover
the essence of things. [. . . ] Pure political economy has therefore a great inter-
est in relying as little as possible on the domain of psychology.&rdquo; He replaced
the concept of measurable and comparable utility with the concept of an or-
dinal preference ordering and even went a step further by suggesting that one
should not think of a preference ordering as something that summarizes what
is going on in the mind or brain, but as a mere as-if-device that allows one to
explain behavior without giving it a deeper meaning.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.1 Basic Concepts 157
</p>
<p>However, Pareto kept a minimal theory of mind by assuming that alterna-
tives that individuals rank higher in their preference ordering are better for
them (given their own subjective standard). This assumption led to the idea
of what is today called Pareto efficiency as a normative criterion (see Chap. 5
for the definition).
</p>
<p>This concept of preferences and the associated idea that utility functions
have no deeper ontological meaning beyond representing preferences led to
the development of economic analysis of individual behavior on the basis
of indifference curves by Edgeworth and it was perceived as liberating at
the time. The enthusiasm can still be sensed in the following quote (Eu-
gen Slutsky (1915/1952)): &ldquo;[I]f we wish to place economic science upon a
solid basis, we must make it completely independent of psychological as-
sumptions [. . . ].&rdquo; In the wake of this enthusiasm, economics also developed
from a rather narrow science of market behavior to a one-size-fits-all tool
in an attempt to understand society at large (John Hicks and Douglas Allen
1934): &ldquo;The methodological implications of [the new] conception of utility
[. . . ] are far reaching indeed. By transforming the subjective theory of value
into a general logic of choice, they extent its applicability over wide fields of
human conduct.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>There is one issue remaining before I can move on to applying the theory of pref-
erence orderings in order to better understand the market behavior of consumers. Up
until this point the assumption has been that preference orderings can be represented
by a utility function, but this is far from obvious. In fact, there is a counterexam-
ple that is not too far off the mark when it comes to human behavior. Assume that
a consumer who has the choice between two goods, x1 and x2, has the following
preferences: she prefers more of good 1 to less of good 1 and the same for good 2,
but for every quantity of good 1 and, irrespective of the quantity of good 2 that she
could consume, she prefers more of good 1. These preferences are called lexico-
graphic, because the individual orders the quantities of the goods in the same way
as a lexicon orders entries: it defines a hierarchy that gives priority of the first letter
over the second, the second letter over the third and so on. Only in the event of a tie
in the first letter, the second letter becomes relevant and so on. Figure 7.4 illustrates
this case.
</p>
<p>Here is an example: assume the consumer has the choice between three alterna-
tives x1 D .1; 1/, x2 D .1; 100/, x3 D .2; 1/. With lexicographic preferences, the
consumer prefers x2 to x1 (more of good 2) and x3 to x2 (more of good 1, in which
good 2 does not matter as soon as there is more of 1).
</p>
<p>Lexicographic preferences may seem rather special and they probably are, but
one cannot exclude them from consideration without knowing what people really
want. However, the problem with these preferences is that they cannot be repre-
sented by a utility function. Understanding the deeper reason for this odd result
requires some knowledge in measure theory. Intuitively speaking, there are not</p>

<p>enough real numbers to represent all the information that is in such a preference
ordering. One way to fix the problem is to assume a continuity of preferences,
which gives one an explanation for this assumption, and I will henceforth assume
that preference orderings are continuous.

<p>7.2 Demand on Competitive Markets
</p>
<p>Chapter 4 described several causal factors that explain both individual and market
demand on a competitive market. It was argued that demand will most likely de-
pend on the price of the good as well as the prices of other goods, the income of an
individual, the individual&rsquo;s tastes and expectations of the future. I am now in a posi-
tion to replace these intuitive arguments with a sound decision-theoretical analysis
using the model of preference or utility maximization introduced before. Remem-
ber that economic decision theory comes in two parts: the specification of a choice
set and the determination of individual choices from this set for given preferences.
</p>
<p>Assume that an individual (Ann) has the choice between two consumption
goods, 1 and 2, whose quantities are denoted by x1 and x2, both from the set of
positive real numbers (including 0). The individual behaves as a price taker and
has a budget or income b that she completely spends on the two goods. (The model
is very versatile, if one assumes, for example, that x1 is the consumption today</p>

<p>and that x2 is the consumption tomorrow, it can be interpreted in an intertemporal
way to analyze savings behavior.) The prices of the two goods are p1 and p2,
respectively.
</p>
<p>This information can be used to specify Ann&rsquo;s choice set: we know that Ann can
spend at most b units of money for the two goods. Expenditures for them are equal
to p1 �x1Cp2 �x2. Hence, if expenditures cannot exceed the budget, it must be that:
</p>
<p>p1 � x1 C p2 � x2 � b:
</p>
<p>This inequality defines ✍all the pairs x1; x2 that Ann can afford to buy, given her
income b and prices p1; p2. It is her choice set that will henceforth also be called her
budget set and denoted by B.p1; p2; b/. If Ann completely spends her budget, one
will reach a point along the boundary of this set, p1 �x1Cp2 �x2 D b. This equality
implicitly defines a function that is called the budget constraint or the budget line.
Figure 7.5 illustrates the budget set.
</p>
<p>In this figure, x1 is drawn along the abscissa and x2 along the ordinate. Using
this convention, one can use the budget constraint to solve for x2,

</p>
<p>This equation reveals that the budget constraint is a downward sloping straight line
that intersects the abscissa at b=p2, the ordinate at b=p1 and has a slope �p1=p2.
The set below and to the left of this line is the budget set. It defines the set of all
consumption bundles that Ann can afford to buy.
</p>
<p>The budget constraint changes with changes in prices or income, as indicated
in Fig. 7.6. Note that it shifts outwards (inwards) in a parallel way if the income
goes up (down). It rotates outwards (inwards) through the intersection with the
ordinate (0; b=p2) if p1 goes down (up) and it rotates outwards (inwards) through
the intersection with the abscissa (b=p1; 0) if p2 goes down (up).
</p>
<p>The slope of the budget constraint �p1=p2 has an important economic interpre-
tation; it measures the rate at which the two goods can be exchanged against each
other. Assume that b D 100, that p1 D 8 and that p2 D 4. In this example,
�p1=p2 D �2: if one spends one&rsquo;s whole income on the two goods, one has to
forfeit two units of good one if one wants to consume an additional unit of good 2,
because good 2 is twice as expensive as good 1. The slope �p1=p2 is, therefore,
the relative price of good 1 in units of good 2 and measures the opportunity costs
of an additional unit of good 2 as defined by market prices.
</p>
<p>7.2.1 Graphical Solution
</p>
<p>Now one can apply the concept of preference orderings or utility functions in order
to analyze choice. The hypotheses that can be derived depend on the assumptions
that one makes regarding the structure of the preference ordering. Most of the liter-
ature assumes that individual behavior in markets can be described as if individuals
would like to maximize a continuous (Assumption 3), monotonic (Assumption 4)
and convex (Assumption 5a) or strictly convex (Assumption 5b) preference order-
ing based on their respective budget sets B.p1; p2; b/. In order to have an easier
diagrammatic representation of the choice problem, it is also assumed that pref-</p>

</p>
<p>erences are not only defined on B.p1; p2; b/ but also on all possible consumption
bundles .x1; x2/, irrespective of whether the individual can afford them or not.
</p>
<p>Continuity implies that a preference ordering can be represented by a (utility)
function, u.x1; x2/, and I will henceforth work with this convention. In order to
illustrate the choice problem of an individual (Ann) I will assume in the remain-
der of this subchapter that her preferences are strictly convex and that they can
be represented by a continuously differentiable utility function. In that case, her
indifference curves for different levels of utility uj must be inward bending, as il-
lustrated in Fig. 7.7, where I have drawn three indifference curves for utility levels
u1 &lt; u2 &lt; u3. In order to keep the language simple I will refer to indifference
curves that have larger utility indices as &ldquo;higher&rdquo; and indifference curves that have
smaller utility indices as &ldquo;lower.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Monotonicity implies that indifference curves that correspond to higher utility
levels lie to the upper right of indifference curves that correspond to lower levels
of utility. As one can see, the indifference curves provide an ordering of the set of
potential consumption bundles. Starting from a given indifference curve, consump-
tion bundles that lie on indifference curves with a larger utility index are preferred
and bundles on indifference curves with a smaller utility index make the individual
worse off, in comparison.
</p>
<p>If one adds the budget set to the picture, one can use the ordering induced by
indifference curves to predict behavior.</p>

<p>Fig. 7.8 Structure of optimal choices
</p>
<p>Figure 7.8 displays a family of indifference curves that is derived from a utility
function u.x1; x2/, and a budget set B.p1; p2; b/. Qualitatively there are four poten-
tial situations that can occur. These are denoted by consumption bundles A;B;C
and D. Consumption bundle A is affordable for Ann because it is within her budget
set. However, it is not Ann&rsquo;s best choice. If one compares A and B , one can see
that B is on a higher indifference curve than A, but still within Ann&rsquo;s budget set.
Hence, she would prefer B to A. Is B optimal for Ann? One could argue that C
is even better, because it is on an even higher indifference curve. However, note
that a consumption bundle like C is outside of Ann&rsquo;s budget set: she would prefer
C to B but cannot afford it. Hence, C cannot be her optimal choice either. What
one therefore has to do in order to determine Ann&rsquo;s best choice is to look for the
highest indifference curve that still belongs to her budget set. Consumption bundle
D fulfills this requirement. D is associated with the highest indifference curve that
still belongs to budget set B.p1; p2; b/.
</p>
<p>A situation like D has a straightforward economic meaning that is important
for understanding the concept of opportunity costs as well as the mechanics of the
utility-maximization model. Note that the slope of the budget constraint and the
slope of the indifference curve are identical at a point like D. The slope of the bud-
get constraint measures the relative price of the two goods and the ratio at which
they can be exchanged on the market. The slope of the indifference curve is the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.2 Demand on Competitive Markets 163
</p>
<p>marginal rate of substitution (MRS) and thus the exchange rate between the two
goods that makes Ann indifferent between two bundles. At a point like D, both
exchange rates coincide and the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the rela-
tive price. Why is this condition economically meaningful? Look at the following
example: assume that the relative price of good 1 in terms of good 2 is �2 and
that the marginal rate of substitution of good 1 in terms of good 2 is �4 at point
B . (The budget constraint is less steep than the indifference curve.) Hence, Ann
would be willing to give away four units of good 2 for an additional unit of good
1 to stay indifferent. However, given the market rate of exchange, she only has to
give away two units. Hence, she can be better off by consuming more of good 1 at
the expense of good 2. This logic applies to all consumption bundles for which the
&ldquo;internal&rdquo; rate of exchange (the MRS) differs from the &ldquo;external&rdquo; rate of exchange
(the relative price). Hence, only consumption bundles for which the marginal rate
of substitution equals the relative price are consistent with the assumption of utility
maximization.
</p>
<p>The fact that the utility-maximizing consumption bundle is on the budget con-
straint and not in the interior of the budget set is a consequence of the assumption
of monotonicity of preferences. With non-monotonic preferences, it could be that
Ann is satiated without fully spending her income. Monotonicity, in this sense, can
therefore be thought of as an expression of the underlying assumption of scarcity:
with non-monotonic preferences, there could be situations with high incomes b such
that all of Ann&rsquo;s desires are fulfilled. This would be the point at which scarcity &ndash; at
least for Ann &ndash; ceases to exist. It is, ultimately, an empirical question as to whether
such a point can ever be reached or not. One should, therefore, take the assumption
with caution because its unscrutinized acceptance implies that one has implicitly
commuted to the idea of quantitative growth in terms of some measure, like gross
national product.
</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that the MRS equals the relative price of the two goods at the
optimum is a consequence of the assumption of the strict convexity of preferences
(in fact, indifference curves additionally have to be continuously differentiable in
order to guarantee this, otherwise they could have &ldquo;kinks&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>7.2.2 Analytical Solution
</p>
<p>The utility-maximization problem can also be studied analytically. In order to do
so, one starts by formally stating Ann&rsquo;s choice situation. One is confronted with an
optimization problem that has the following structure: p1; p2 and b are the explana-
tory variables of the model, which means that the variables that determine Ann&rsquo;s
consumption decisions are x1 and x2. They are, therefore, the explained variables.
Hence, one needs to determine the functions x1.p1; p2; b/; x2.p1; p2; b/. How is
this possible? By assuming that Ann maximizes her utility function, u.x1; x2/, un-
der the constraint that she does not spend more on consumption than her income is,
p1 � x1 C p2 � x2 � b, one assumes that her preferences are monotonic, one knows</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>164 7 Decisions and Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>that Ann will spend her whole income, and one can write:
</p>
<p>max
x1;x2
</p>
<p>u.x1; x2/ s:t: p1 � x1 C p2 � x2 D b:
</p>
<p>This notation needs some explanation. The maxx1;x2-term indicates that one is
looking for the maximum of the objective (utility) function with respect to the en-
dogenous variables. The term s.t. abbreviates &ldquo;such that,&rdquo; which indicates that Ann
has to respect her budget constraint.
</p>
<p>Formally, this is a constrained optimization problem and there are several ways
to solve it. As long as one restricts one&rsquo;s attention to two endogenous variables,
the solution does not require advanced mathematical techniques; instead one can
simply use the constraint to eliminate one of the endogenous variables in the objec-
tive function. For more general (and realistic) problems in which Ann can choose
between more than two goods, however, one needs a more general procedure that
uses so-called Lagrange multipliers. I will not get any deeper into the field of opti-
mization problems under constraints, because the results that I can derive with the
more elementary approach for the two-goods case gives me sufficient mileage in
explaining individual behavior on competitive markets for an introductory course
in microeconomics.
</p>
<p>In order to solve the problem, one can convert the budget constraint in the same
way as I have shown before, x2 D b=p2 � .p1=p2/ � x1, and denote the function
that relates x1 and x2 by X2.x1/ D b=p2 � .p1=p2/ � x1. This equation can be
used to eliminate x2 in the utility function. One, therefore, ends up with a modified,
unconstrained optimization problem:
</p>
<p>max
x1
</p>
<p>u.x1; X2.x1// D max
x1
</p>
<p>u.x1; b=p2 � .p1=p2/ � x1/:
</p>
<p>In order to illustrate how this problem can be solved, assume that u.x1; x2/ is twice
continuously differentiable and that the underlying preference ordering is strictly
convex. If these assumptions are fulfilled, then an interior maximum is charac-
terized by a value of x1, such that the first derivative is equal to zero (first-order
condition):

</p>
<p>� @u

</p>
<p>This condition can be simplified to:
</p>
<p>@u=@x1
</p>
<p>@u=@x2
D p1
</p>
<p>p2
;
</p>
<p>which is the optimality condition for the consumer-choice problem. In order to be
able to interpret this condition, one has to understand the term on the left-hand side.
In order to do so, one can use the total differential of the utility function
</p>
<p>du D @u
@x1
</p>
<p>� dx1 C
@u
</p>
<p>@x2
� dx2:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.2 Demand on Competitive Markets 165
</p>
<p>The total differential measures the total effect on utility with a change in the ex-
planatory variable of dx1 and dx2, respectively. One is not interested in arbitrary
changes but in changes that leave total utility constant, du D 0, because this keeps
one on the same indifference curve. In other words, the set of all .x1; x2/ that lead
to the same level of utility constitute the marginal rate of substitution:
</p>
<p>du D @u
@x1
</p>
<p>� dx1 C
@u
</p>
<p>@x2
� dx2 D 0
</p>
<p>, MRS.x1; x2/ D
dx1
</p>
<p>dx2
D @u=@x1
</p>
<p>@u=@x2
:
</p>
<p>However, this is exactly the left-hand side of the optimality condition. One can
therefore conclude that a preference- or utility-maximizing individual chooses con-
sumption in a way that the marginal rate of substitution equals the relative price of
the goods.
</p>
<p>Consumption bundles ✍.x�1 ; x
�
2 / that fulfill the first-order condition are the indi-
</p>
<p>vidual&rsquo;s utility-maximizing choices. Formally, they are functions of the explanatory
variables x1.p1; p2; b/ and x2.p1; p2; b/ and are named Marshallian demand func-
tions after Alfred Marshall. What is interesting, from the point of view of the
structure of individual demand, is whether the Marshallian demand functions have
any particular properties that allow one to better understand the structure of indi-
vidual and, thereby ultimately, market-demand behavior.
</p>
<p>However, here comes the challenge: the ultimate test for the usefulness of a
theory is &ndash; according to critical rationalism (see Chap. 1 for a description of this
position in the philosophy of science) &ndash; its empirical validity. Hence, one has to for-
mulate a theory in a way that makes it empirically testable. The theory of consumer
choice has two building blocks: preferences and choice sets that are determined by
prices and income. It is relatively straightforward to empirically measure the latter
elements of the theory, but it is not possible to determine individual preferences di-
rectly. This is bad news for empirical tests: behavior is determined by both, choice
sets and preferences. If one cannot observe preferences, one cannot test the theory.
Hence, one can only measure the properties of the theory that are independent of the
specific preference ordering underlying consumer choices. However, given that any
choice of consumption can be rational for some preference ordering, the only hope
that one has is that the theory is testable when one looks at changes in observable
behavior that are caused by changes in prices or income. It may be that a change
in prices or income induces stable and predictable reactions that can, in principle,
be falsified by confronting them with empirical data. In order to be able to do so,
however, one has to impose the (dogmatic, see Chap. 1) assumption that preferences
remain stable over a period of time. This is why comparative statics plays such an
important role in economics: if there is any hope for empirically testing the theory,
it is because it produces refutable hypotheses regarding the change in Marshallian
demand functions when prices or income change. Whether the theory can live up
to these standards or not will be the subject of this investigation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>166 7 Decisions and Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>One important property is that Marshallian demand functions are homogeneous
of degree zero, i.e. that a proportional change in all prices and income has no
influence on individual behavior. Formally, this means that xi .p1; p2; b/ D xi .� �
p1; � �p2; � �b/ for i D 1; 2 and � &gt; 0. Intuitively this means that it does not matter
whether prices and income are measured in Swiss Francs or in Rappen, Euro or
Cent; as long as the relative price of both goods and the purchasing power of income
remains the same, the individual will not change her behavior. In order to see that
this must be the case return to the budget constraint x2 D b=p2 � .p1=p2/ � x1. If
all prices and income are multiplied by the same factor �, one gets
</p>
<p>x2 D
�b

� �p1
</p>
<p>�p2
� x1 D
</p>
<p>b
</p>
<p>p2
� p1
</p>
<p>p2
� x1:
</p>
<p>The effect of � cancels out and, therefore, leaves the location of the budget con-
straint unaltered. However, with an unaltered budget constraint, the optimal be-
havior of the individual must be unaltered as well, hence the Marshallian demand
functions are homogeneous of degree zero in prices and income.
</p>
<p>Digression 18. Money Illusion and the Debate Between Keynesian and Neoclas-
</p>
<p>sical Economics
</p>
<p>The homogeneity of degree zero in prices and income of the Marshallian de-
mand function may sound like an innocuous mathematical property, but, in
fact, it marks a very important watershed in the history of economic thinking.
Keynesian and neoclassical economists have profoundly disagreed on the role
of economic policy to stabilize the economy. One important field of disagree-
ment is monetary policy. Neoclassical economists are usually sceptic on the
role that monetary policy can or should play, with the implication that price
stability is usually the primary focus of neoclassical monetary policy. On
the contrary, Keynesian economists usually see a much more active role for
monetary policy in stimulating and stabilizing the economy (Keynes 1936).
</p>
<p>There are several reasons why these schools disagree, but at least one can
be traced back to the homogeneity of degree zero of the Marshallian demand
functions. If this property holds, the possibility to influence the economy
by means of monetary policy are severely limited. Increasing or reducing
money supply is like multiplying all prices and income by �. However, if this
is the case and if the model of utility- or preference-maximizing individuals
is correct, then the real effects of these changes on the economy are zero:
general inflation or deflation is like measuring prices in different currencies
without changing the purchasing power of income or the relative prices of
goods. This property is sometimes also called the absence of money illusion.
Without a money illusion, monetary policy has no impact on the economy,
because people will not change their behavior and, if people&rsquo;s behavior does
not change, then everything remains the same. The only way monetary pol-
icy can influence behavior, according to this view, is if inflation or deflation</p>

</div>

<p>7.2 Demand on Competitive Markets 167
</p>
<p>change different prices and incomes differently, hence either changing rela-
tive prices, purchasing power or both. This can happen if some prices are
nominally fixed, while other prices can adjust to changes in money supply. A
Keynesian economist, who sees an active role for monetary policy, therefore,
either has to think that some prices or incomes are nominally fixed or that the
model of preference or utility maximization is flawed to begin with.
</p>
<p>The first-order condition is only a necessary condition for a utility maximum,
and one does not know yet if it characterizes a local maximum, a local minimum
or a point of inflection. In order to say more, one has to check the second-order
condition. The first-order condition is the function:

only if the underlying preference ordering is convex. Hence, the assumption that the
preference ordering is convex guarantees that the first-order condition characterizes
a maximum. If the inequality is strict, then the preference ordering is strictly convex
and the solution is unique.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>168 7 Decisions and Consumer Behavior
</p>
<p>A utility function with this property is called (strictly) quasi-concave. Quasi-
concavity is weaker than concavity of functions, because it only guarantees that
the not-worse-than-x sets (whose boundaries are the respective indifference curves)
are convex sets, but makes no assumptions about the concavity of the rest of the
function.
</p>
<p>7.2.3 Three Examples
</p>
<p>There are three utility functions that represent typical preference orderings and that
play an important role in a lot of economic applications of the model. This sub-
chapter will analyze these examples both graphically and analytically.
</p>
<p>7.2.3.1 Homothetic Strictly Convex Preferences
An example of a so-called homothetic utility function is given by u.x1; x2/ D
a � .x1/˛ � .x2/ˇ, where a; ˛; ˇ are positive real numbers. It is an example for a
strictly quasi-concave utility function that has the additional property that the MRS
is constant for proportional changes of the two goods (x1=x2 D c, with c &gt; 0 being
constant).
</p>
<p>The following paragraphs focus on a special case in which a D 1 and ˛ D ˇ D
1=2, because it is more convenient to solve mathematically. These assumptions
imply that u.x1; x2/ D

x2. Before one derives the Marshallian demand

<p>functions, it makes sense to familiarize oneself with the structure of this function.

</p>
<p>This is a family of hyperbolic functions, one for each value of Nu, which implies that
the underlying preference ordering is strictly convex.
</p>
<p>At this point, one can further illustrate that every monotonic transformation of a
utility function represents the same preference ordering. If one squares the utility
function (this is a monotonic transformation, because the underlying utility function
only has positive values) one gets v.x1; x2/ D .u.x1; x2//2 D .

value of utility, but remember that this number has no meaningful interpretation.

<p>the income-consumption path. This is depicted by A�, B�, and C �. Figure 7.10b
displays the demand of one of the two goods (say 1) as a function of income levels.
The argument above implies that the relationship between income b and demand
x�1 must be linear. The straight line E reflects this fact. The relationship between
income and utility- or preference-maximizing consumption is called an Engel curve.
In this case, it is upward sloping, which means that the good is normal (see Chapt. 4
for the definition of this term).

<p>in p1 rotates the budget constraint inwards around the point 0; b=p2. The utility-
maximizing consumption bundles are, again, depicted by A�, B� and C �. They lie
on the horizontal line displayed in the figure that is called the price-consumption
path. Figure 7.11b displays the demand for good 1 as a function of its price p1.
This is the individual demand function that is already known from Chap. 4. It is
downward sloping, which means that it is ordinary (see Chap. 4 for the definition
of the term).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can derive Ann&rsquo;s demand function analytically. In order to
do so, one can either use the information that MRS has to be equal to the relative
price directly, or start with the utility-maximization problem. In order to practice,
I will follow the second road in the following paragraphs. Additionally, in order to
simplify the mathematics I will use a utility representation v.x1; x2/ D x1 � x2 (try
the other formulation to see if it leads to the same result):
</p>

x1
</p>
<p>.x1/ � .b=p2 � .p1=p2/ � x1/:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.2 Demand on Competitive Markets 171
</p>
<p>To get the first-order condition one can apply the product rule:
</p>
<p>.b=p2 � .p1=p2/ � x1/ � .p1=p2/ � x1 D 0:
</p>
<p>One can solve this condition for x1 to get the Marshallian demand function for good
1:
</p>
<p>x1.p1; p2; b/ D
b
</p>
<p>2 � p1
:
</p>
<p>Knowing that x2 D b=p2�.p1=p2/�x1, one can also derive the Marshallian demand
function for good 2:
</p>
<p>x2.p1; p2; b/ D
b
</p>
<p>2 � p2
:
</p>
<p>The demand functions have three remarkable properties. First, they are linear in
income, which is what one would have expected from the linearity of the Engel
curve. Second, they are downward sloping and hyperbolic in their own prices,
which is also what one would have expected from the graphic analysis. Third, they
do not depend on the price of the other good.
</p>
<p>These utility functions play an important role in economic applications, because
of their simplicity. They can be generalized by assuming that the relative impor-
tance of the two different goods can be measured by some parameter ˛ 2 Œ0; 1&#141; that
yields u.x1; x2/ D x˛1 � x1�˛2 . It is, however, not clear if individuals behave as if
they maximize preferences of this type. It is more useful as a thought experiment
than an empirically supported claim about actual behavior.
</p>
<p>7.2.3.2 Perfect Substitutes
The above utility function represents a case in which individuals prefer to consume
the goods in relatively balanced bundles, but react to price changes by increasing
the relative demand of the good that gets relatively cheaper. This need not be the
case. There may be goods for which the individual has more extreme preferences:
Ann consumes either one or the other, depending on which one is cheaper. If this
is the case, the two goods are called perfect substitutes and such a taste can be
represented by the following utility function:
</p>
<p>u.x1; x2/ D ˛ � x1 C ˇ � x2;
</p>
<p>in which ˛=ˇ measures the relative importance of good 1 compared to good 2. This
function is homothetic as well. In the following paragraphs, assume that they are
of equal importance to Ann and normalize them to ˛ D ˇ D 1. In this case,
Ann&rsquo;s indifference curves are downward sloping straight lines with a slope of �1.
A family of indifference curves is denoted by the dotted lines in Fig. 7.12. I have
also drawn a budget constraint in this figure. It is already known that its graph is a
straight line with slope �p1=p2, so the optimal consumption bundle depends on the
relative slope of the indifference curves and the budget constraint: if the former is
steeper than the latter, then Ann only consumes good 2 (as in the Figure) and vice</p>

<p>versa. If both curves have an equal slope, then Ann would be indifferent between
both goods.
</p>
<p>Given that Ann will only buy the relatively cheaper good, the Engel curves are
easy to derive. They are a straight line with slope 0 for the relatively more expensive
and a straight line with slope 1=pi for the relatively cheaper good. Price changes
can be analyzed as before, but have a somewhat different effect on demand. Figure
7.13a shows a family of indifference curves and &ndash; as in the first example of a utility
function analyzed before &ndash; adds different budget constraints to different price levels
for good 1, p11 &lt; p
</p>
<p>2
1 D p2 &lt; p31 . An increase in p1 lets the budget constraint rotate
</p>
<p>inwards around the point .0; b=p2/. The utility-maximizing consumption bundles
are, again, depicted by A�, B� and C �. If the price for good 1 is smaller than the
price for good 2, then Ann spends all her income on good 1, which is indicated
by point A�. If both prices are equal (p21 D p2), then Ann is indifferent between
both goods and we use the convention that she buys equal quantities, in this case. If
p1 rises further, then demand is zero, because Ann prefers the cheaper good. This
behavior is illustrated by the demand function in Fig. 7.13b. It is discontinuous at
p1 D p2 and hyperbolic for smaller prices of good 1.
</p>
<p>If one remembers the analysis of competitive behavior in Chap. 4, this discon-
tinuity can be problematic, because it may be that there is no intersection between
market demand and market supply, in this case. This is why the continuity of both</p>

<p>demand and supply functions are important to guarantee the existence of a compet-
itive equilibrium and one has now seen a case in which this is not the case. This
reveals an advantage of the behavioral foundation of the demand function: it leads
to a better understanding of the deeper reasons behind the continuity or discontinu-
ity of demand functions by linking them to individual preferences. As one can see,
the potential non-existence of an equilibrium can be a result of preferences that are
not entirely absurd. The deeper reason for the discontinuity is that the preference or-
dering is only convex, not strictly convex. With strictly convex preferences, &ldquo;small&rdquo;
changes in prices will lead to &ldquo;small&rdquo; changes in demand, but this is not the case if
goods are, for example, perfect substitutes.
</p>
<p>In order to derive the Marshallian demand functions analytically, one has to be
careful. Given that both the budget constraint and the indifference curves are linear,
the utility maximum cannot be derived from the first-order condition. Fortunately,
one has already collected almost all the information that is necessary to determine
Marshallian demand. One knows that Ann only buys the cheaper good and one has
introduced the convention that she splits her income equally if both goods have the
same price. The only step left is to formalize this information:

<p>7.2.3.3 Perfect Complements
The last example that I discuss is, in a sense, the opposite extreme from the case
of perfect substitutes. There are some goods that Ann wants to consume together
in fixed proportions, like left and right shoes, printer and toner, or hardware and</p>

<p>software. If this is the case, she wants to spend her income on the two goods in way
that makes sure that she buys both goods in fixed proportions. A utility function
that expresses such preferences is:
</p>
<p>u.x1; x2/ D minf˛ � x1; ˇ � x2g;
</p>
<p>in which ˛=ˇ measures the number of units of good 2 that Ann needs to make use
of an additional unit of good 1. This is also a homothetic function. To see this,
assume that x1 is the number of car bodies and x2 is the number of wheels. It takes
four wheels and a car body to assemble a useful car, so if ˛ D 4 and ˇ D 1 one
gets ˛=ˇ D 4, the number of units of good 2 (wheels) that is needed for one unit
of good 1 (car bodies). The following paragraphs will focus on the easiest case in
which ˛ D ˇ D 1, i.e., Ann needs one unit of good 1 together with one unit of
good 2, u.x1; x2/ D minfx1; x2g.
</p>
<p>How do the indifference curves look like? I have drawn a family of them in
Fig. 7.14a. They are L-shaped with a kink at the 45-degree line, which is where
both goods are consumed in equal quantities. Increasing the quantity of one good
while keeping the quantity of the other good constant is useless for Ann, which is
why points on the vertical and horizontal lines are on the same indifference curve.
</p>
<p>I have also added budget constraints for different income levels b1 &lt; b2 &lt; b3.
As one can see, the utility-maximizing consumption bundle is always at the kink,
which is why they are along the 45-degree line through the origin. This is depicted
by A�, B� and C �. It follows immediately that the Engel curve must also be a
straight line as in Fig. 7.14b.</p>

<p>How about changes in prices? As before, an increase in the price of good 1
rotates the budget constraint inwards. Once again, I focus on three such prices
p11 &lt; p
</p>
<p>2
1 &lt; p
</p>
<p>3
1 and illustrate them in Fig. 7.15a.
</p>
<p>One already knows that Ann will always buy both goods in equal quantities, i.e.,
stay on the 45-degree line. However, this implies that both the demand for good
1 and for good 2 is falling, if the price for good 1 goes up. Hence, the demand
function for good 1 is given by the downward sloping graph in Fig. 7.15b. Note
that it intersects the abscissa at x1 D b=p2, because at p1 D 0 Ann can afford b=p2
units of both goods. It is illustrative to also look at x2 as a function of p1, which is
done in Fig. 7.16.
</p>
<p>One knows that Ann will always buy both goods in equal quantities. However,
this implies that the demand of good 2, as a function of p1, is identical to the
demand of good 1, as a function of p1.
</p>
<p>In order to derive the Marshallian demand functions analytically, first note that
one cannot use first-order conditions in this case either, because the indifference
curves have a kink, which implies that they cannot be continuously differentiated.
Fortunately, the problem is very intuitive to solve. One knows that Ann is con-
strained by her budget, p1 � x1 C p2 � x2 D b, and wants to consume both goods
in equal quantities, x1 D x2 D x. This information can be used in the budget
constraint to get p1 � x C p2 � x D b. However, this is a linear function in one
endogenous variable, so one can solve it. The solution is:

</p>
<p>7.2.4 Comparative Statics and the Structure of Market Demand
</p>
<p>The three examples for potential preference orderings with associated utility func-
tions have revealed that there is a stable relationship between the structure of pref-
erences on the one and the structure of market demand on the other hand. In all
three cases, one has seen that individual demand is decreasing in the price of the
good and (weakly) increasing in income. The cross-price effects, however, seem
to be more complex. They do not exist in the strictly convex and homothetic case,
are (weakly) positive but extreme in the case of perfect substitutes and negative in
the case of perfect complements. One has also seen that the strict convexity of the
preference ordering seems to be important in order to guarantee that an equilibrium
exists, because individual demand can otherwise be discontinuous.
</p>
<p>Now one can find out if these findings can be generalized. Preferences are not
directly observable and individuals seem to differ substantially with respect to their
tastes. Hence, it would be nice if one did not have to make too many assumptions
on the structure of preferences, as every assumption reduces the explanatory power
of the theory, because they rule out certain preferences of which one does not know
if they accurately describe real-life individuals. Thus, one can see how far one
gets if one imposes monotonicity and strict convexity of a preference ordering with
respect to the structure of individual demand. In order to do this, one can focus on
two comparative-static experiments: a change in income and a change in the price
of a good.</p>

</p>
<p>7.2.5 Changes in Income
</p>
<p>One has already seen that a change in income leads to a parallel shift of the budget
constraint. Furthermore, one has already seen in the above examples that goods can
be normal (demand increases if income increases). The remaining question is if this
property is an artifact of the specific preference orderings or whether it is a general
property of demand functions that are derived from preferences. Figure 7.17 shows
that this is unfortunately not the case.
</p>
<p>It displays two income levels, b1 and b2, and the associated indifference curves
that Ann can reach, if she maximizes utility. As can be seen, the demand for good
2 goes up if income goes up, but the demand for good 1 does not. Hence, good 2 is
normal and good 1 is inferior for this change in income. (Note that these properties
are local and that they can hold for some changes in income, but not for others.)
Hence, strict convexity and monotonicity do not rule out the inferiority of one of
the goods. Besides, they should not, because there are a lot of goods that are, in fact,
inferior, like low-quality products that are replaced by higher-quality substitutes, if
the individual gets richer.</p>

</p>
<p>7.2.6 Changes in Price
</p>
<p>In addition to continuity, individual and market demand should be decreasing as the
price of the good increases in order to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a
competitive equilibrium. If demand is increasing as its price increases, there may
be cases in which an equilibrium does not exist at all or in which multiple equilibria
exist. Figures 7.18a and 7.18b illustrate both cases.
</p>
<p>Hence, it would✍ be nice if one could show that goods are ordinary if individuals
maximize a monotonic and strictly convex preference ordering. Unfortunately, this
is not the case. Figure 7.19 gives an example for the so-called Giffen paradox,
which is a situation in which the demand of a good decreases despite the fact that
its price decreases.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.19 focuses on a decrease in the price of good 1 from p11 to p
2
1 .

</p>
<p>curves that can be reached are denoted by I.p11 ; p2; b/ and I.p
2
1; p2; b/. As can
</p>
<p>be seen, the demand for good 1 goes down (and the demand for good 2 goes up)
and this follows necessarily from the strict convexity of the preference ordering,
because one is moving along the indifference curve.
</p>
<p>What is going on here? One gets closer to understanding this phenomenon if one
focuses on the curvature of the indifference curves. If the change in p1 did not in-
duce a rotation around .0; b=p2/ but instead induce a rotation along the indifference
curve (see Fig. 7.20), then the effect of an decrease in the price of good 1 would
have the expected negative sign: good 1 gets relatively cheaper compared to good
2 and this isolated effect motivates Ann to buy more of good 1 and less of good
2. However, the reduction of p1 not only has the effect that good 1 gets relatively</p>

<p>cheaper, it also makes Ann richer, because her new budget set contains the old one
as a subset. As a matter of fact, it is this latter effect that may cause the Giffen
paradox.
</p>
<p>In order to understand this, one has to disentangle the two effects in Fig. 7.21.
Figure 7.21 is identical✍ to Fig. 7.19, with the exception that I have introduced
</p>
<p>an artificial budget constraint for a hypothetical income level Qb. This hypothetical
constraint is constructed to allow Ann to reach the same maximum indifference
curve as before the price change, I.p11; p2; b/. In order to guarantee this, one
</p>
<p>has to change her income from b to some hypothetical income level Qb, such that
I.p11; p2; b/ D I.p21; p2; Qb/. The utility-maximizing consumption bundle that re-
sults from this hypothetical budget constraint p21 �x1Cp2 �x2 D Qb is denoted by C D

sated demand for good 1 is larger than before, x1.p

the isolated effect of a change in the relative price is negative (a smaller price and a
larger quantity). This compensated effect is called the price effect, and it brings us
from A to C in the figure.
</p>
<p>However, the compensation✍ in income from b to Qb is only the first step in the
thought experiment. Therefore, in the next step, one will see what happens if one</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>moves from .p21 ; p2;
Qb/ to .p21 ; p2; b/. This change holds the relative price con-
</p>
<p>stant, but changes Ann&rsquo;s income and one has already seen what can happen. One
already knows that this change brings one from C to B , but the additional insight
is that this is only possible if the good is inferior; comparing C with B reveals that

</p>
<p>2
1 ; p2;
</p>
<p>Qb/. This is called the income effect.
This thought experiment is important, because it allows one to better understand
</p>
<p>why individual demand may not fall as its own price falls. Any change in the price
of one good has a price as well as an income effect and it is the income effect that
may cause the Giffen paradox: if the good is inferior for Ann, then it is possible
that her demand is (locally) increasing as the price increases.
</p>
<p>This result is perhaps intellectually fascinating and it allows one to understand
the mechanics of the preference-maximization model more profoundly, but it is,
at the same time, highly unsatisfactory. In the end, the whole exercise to develop
a choice-theoretic foundation of market behavior was motivated to better under-
stand the structure of demand functions on competitive markets. These demand
functions have to fulfill certain properties, like continuity and ordinary goods, to
ensure that a market equilibrium exists. What one can learn from the Giffen para-
dox and its deeper reasons is that the assumption of preference maximization alone
(even with the further restrictive assumptions of strict convexity and monotonicity)
is insufficient to guarantee that a unique equilibrium exists. As Chap. 4 described,
existence and uniqueness are important for positive economics, because sound eco-
nomic prognoses depend on them. As one has seen with the three examples above
on economic preferences, one can guarantee existence and uniqueness by imposing
additional assumptions regarding preferences (like the assumption that all individ-
uals have strictly quasi-concave utility functions), but this comes at the cost of
sacrificing generality. Additionally, this cost is substantial indeed, because one does
not have epistemic access to individual preferences, so one cannot know if any spe-
cific assumptions regarding their structure are empirically justified. However, this
is the situation: if one wants a general theory of consumer choice that allows all
types of preferences, then one cannot be sure that an equilibrium exists or if it is
unique and if one want a unique existing equilibrium, then one has to start from
specific assumptions regarding preferences.

<p>If one goes shopping and buys a new pair of sneakers, the cost for one&rsquo;s sneakers
is the price that one pays for them. The monetary price of a good is, however,
only part of the story economists tell when they talk about costs. As covered in
Chap. 1, scarcity implies that one&rsquo;s decision to go this way makes it impossible to
go the other way; that all activities have opportunity costs. The opportunity cost of
choosing one alternative is the value that one attaches to the next-best alternative
foregone. The implication for the sneakers example is that the total costs of the
sneakers are, in general, higher than the price one pays, because one has to invest
time and effort to find and buy them. If one could have used one&rsquo;s time otherwise,
then one has to take the opportunity costs of time into consideration to get a correct
measure of the costs one has to incur to get hold of a new pair of sneakers. To give
another example, opportunity costs are the reason why it may be silly to drive the
extra mile to refuel your car, only because the gas station is a cent cheaper.
</p>
<p>However, the true costs of sneakers are only higher than the monetary costs in
general. It may be that one actually enjoys going shopping, which implies that the

<p>184 8 Costs
</p>
<p>opportunity costs of time are negative, subtracting from the monetary costs. More-
over, to make things even more involved, the value that one attaches to the price
sticker may depend on one&rsquo;s situation in life and one&rsquo;s expectations. If one assumes
that there will be considerable inflation the next day, reducing one&rsquo;s purchasing
power substantially, one will most likely do one&rsquo;s best to get rid of one&rsquo;s money
that day. Thus, all costs are ultimately opportunity costs, which are psychological
and subjective concepts of value that are related, but not identical, to market prices.
</p>
<p>The fact that the relevant costs are opportunity costs may be interesting in and of
itself, but the real importance of this observation becomes apparent if one considers
the implications for decision making. Here is an example: assume one wants to
make some extra money parallel to one&rsquo;s studies by offering tutoring services to
other students, but one is not sure whether this is a good idea, because one does
not fully oversee all the consequences of this decision. In order to get a better idea,
one makes a business plan to identify the costs and benefits of one&rsquo;s decision. To
keep the analysis simple, assume that one can help one student at a time (class size
is one) and that the only things one needs to get one&rsquo;s business going is one&rsquo;s time
and a room that one has to rent. Further, assume that one can teach up to 20 hours
per month. The monthly rent for the room is CHF 500, and one can charge students
CHF 50 for an hour of tutoring. A first back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals
that one has to teach for ten hours per month to cover one&rsquo;s monetary costs (this
is called the break-even point). If one teaches for the entire 20 hours, one ends up
with a monetary profit of CHF 500. Given this calculation, the question is if one is
willing to enter the tutoring business. Based on the above calculation, one should
enter the tutoring business because of the positive monetary profit.
</p>
<p>If, however, one does not feel completely happy with starting the business based
on this calculation, the reason must be that one puts this number into a different
context. What could that context be? For example, the next-best alternative on
the job market could be to work as a barista in a caf&eacute;, at an hourly wage of CHF
30 (including tips). Thus, working 20 hours, one could earn CHF 600 per month.
Even though the hourly wage is much smaller than the one that one could earn for
tutoring, the income exceeds the profits from tuition, because one does not need to
pay the rent. Therefore, compared to the barista job, one would loose CHF 100 by
opening one&rsquo;s business. Hence, one should somehow take these opportunity costs
explicitly into consideration.
</p>
<p>Now, one could argue that tutoring is a more meaningful way to spend time
for one than brewing coffee is. If this is the case, one should also include these
psychological rewards and costs into one&rsquo;s calculation. Working may not just be
about making money, but also about doing something that one finds meaningful,
which implies that there is a difference between costs and expenditures. Assume
that one assesses the intrinsic pleasure that one gains from tutoring by CHF 30
and the intrinsic pleasure that one gains from brewing coffee by CHF 20 per hour.
In that case, these psychological benefits sum up to opportunity costs of brewing
coffee of CHF 20 �CHF 30�20 �CHF 20 D CHF 200, which would tip the balance
towards opening one&rsquo;s tutorial business.</p>

<p>One can elaborate on one more aspect of the problem of getting the business plan
straight before summarizing it. Assume that the alternative to opening one&rsquo;s busi-
ness is not working as a barista, but studying for one&rsquo;s exams. In that case, there are
no direct monetary opportunity costs that can be taken into consideration. However,
even in this case, one has to figure out how much the additional 20 hours of studying
would be worth. These benefits might be completely functional, driven by the effect
that one&rsquo;s grades get better and one is, therefore, more likely to qualify for better
programs and jobs. On the other hand, they might be purely intrinsic, measuring the
pleasure that one derives from learning. Regardless how one evaluates one&rsquo;s own
situation, the theory suggests that one should be able to attach some monetary value
to these alternatives in order to be able to make the right decision. Table 8.1 gives
an overview of the example. It is assumed that one can attach a monetary value of
CHF 500 to the intrinsic pleasure of learning and a monetary value of CHF 1; 000
to the better job prospects.
</p>
<p>What the above example has illustrated is that costs are a tool that can help one
to make smart decisions. However, in order to be able to support your decisions in a
rational way, one has to think about costs in terms of opportunity costs. If the costs
are calculated incorrectly, then one&rsquo;s decisions will not be smart.
</p>
<p>One may wonder if it is always possible to attach a meaningful monetary value to
psychological opportunity costs. Numerous psychological studies have shown that,
for different reasons, people have trouble specifying their valuations of alternatives
in a reasonable way. Section 5.3 discussed some of these reasons. How reliable is
the figure that one attaches to the value of 20 hours of additional learning? Will
one really use the time to learn? Can one anticipate how much fun it will be to
help other students? People are very bad in what is called affectual forecasting, i.e.
anticipating how they will feel in the future. Is one&rsquo;s perception of the psychologi-
cal costs and the benefits context-dependent (the anchoring effect from Sect. 5.3)?
There is also evidence that people have a tendency to rationalize their gut feelings
by developing narratives that selectively focus on aspects that support their &ldquo;guts.&rdquo;
The term narrative fallacy describes how flawed stories of the past influence one&rsquo;s
perception of the present and future. People have an innate urge to develop a coher-
ent story about the events that shape their lives and simplicity and coherence often
more important than accuracy. The mind is a sense-making organ and the narratives
it cooks up reduce the anxiety that one would experience if one faced the complex-</p>

<p>186 8 Costs
</p>
<p>ity and unpredictability of life. This may help one in one&rsquo;s life, but it is not the same
as descriptive accuracy.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if one has ample reason to scrutinize the numbers that one as-
signs to psychological opportunity costs, would it not be better to abandon the idea
altogether? This would throw out the baby with the bathwater, because one has
to decide somehow and decisions that take all the relevant opportunity costs into
consideration are, in expectation, better than decisions that neglect some of the
tradeoffs. An awareness of the flaws and biases that exist when one thinks about
psychological opportunity costs can help one to put the concept into perspective
and to cope with the idiosyncrasies of one&rsquo;s mind.
</p>
<p>The following three examples will illustrate how one can proceed in assigning
opportunity costs. Assume that a firm produces a good using capital and labor.
Profits are revenues minus costs. What are the costs and revenues that are associated
with this activity?
</p>
<p>� Case 1, all costs monetary: The firm borrows capital from capital markets,
rents labor from labor markets and sells the good on a goods market. In this
case, the revenues of the firm are the market price times the produced and sold
quantity of the good (assume revenues are CHF 1,000). The firm&rsquo;s costs are the
sum of interest payments for rented capital (CHF 400) and wage payments for
hired labor (CHF 500). All relevant costs and revenues are monetary, because
they involve market transactions. An accounting system that includes (&ldquo;takes
into account&rdquo;) all three costs and benefits makes the business appear profitable.
</p>
<p>� Case 2, goods not sold: The firm borrows capital from capital markets, rents
labor from labor markets, but the owner of the firm consumes the goods directly.
The costs of the firm are, again, the sum of interest payments (CHF 400) for
rented capital and wage payments for hired labor (CHF 500). However, it has no
monetary revenues. A system of accounting that considers only monetary pay-
ments would support the decision to shut down the business, because it would
show a deficit of CHF 900. There is no monetary equivalent for the satisfaction
or utility of the owner from consuming the goods (again CHF 1,000). Hence,
economically meaningful decisions can only be supported by an accounting sys-
tem that attaches a monetary value to the satisfaction or utility of the owner.
</p>
<p>� Case 3, owner self-employed: The firm borrows capital from capital markets,
sells the good on a goods market, but the owner works himself. In this case, the
firm&rsquo;s revenues are, again, the market price times the produced and sold quantity
of the good (for example CHF 800 this time). The firm&rsquo;s monetary costs are
the interest payments for rented capital (CHF 400). Without incorporating labor
costs into the equation, the business appears profitable. However, this calculation
would lead to the wrong decision. Assume the owner would make CHF 500, if he
worked somewhere else. These opportunity costs should be taken into account
to support the right decision. The business now appears deficient and, compared
to the next-best alternative, it actually is: if the owner were to shut down the
firm, he would earn CHF 500. Staying in business gives a monetary profit of
CHF 400, so he actually loses CHF 100 compared to the next best alternative.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.1 What Are Costs, and why Are They Important? 187
</p>
<p>What are the consequences Bof the idea that costs and revenues have to incorporate
non-monetary opportunity costs? First of all, it can serve as a guideline for the de-
sign of managerial accounting systems. One of the primary reasons for the existence
of accounting systems is that they can support decisions. However, as one has seen,
decisions are only accurate according to some objective (profits, in this example)
of the firm, if the accounting system that supports decisions incorporates all oppor-
tunity costs. These opportunity costs are sometimes referred to as imputed interest
or calculatory entrepreneur&rsquo;s salary. Management accounting, however, has to be
distinguished from financial reporting. The primary purpose of the latter is to com-
municate a company&rsquo;s financial situation to the outside world. These statements are
subject to legal constraints and regulations that are sometimes incompatible with
the idea of opportunity costs. So-called imputed costs are a good example of op-
portunity costs that are, in general, considered in management accounting, but are
not allowed to be considered in financial statements. It is, for example, possible
to activate interest payments on debt capital, but not imputed interest payments on
equity. Imputed interest payments on equity are opportunity costs, because they are
equal to the interest payments one would have received, if the capital had been lent
to someone else.
</p>
<p>Digression 19. Opportunity Costs andMaximization
</p>
<p>The idea that rational decisions are based on the correct identification, eval-
uation and comparison of opportunity costs is closely related to the idea of
maximization. An individual is a maximizer, if she consistently chooses the
best (according to her subjective standard) alternative among the available
alternatives. There is a lot of evidence that people are rarely maximizers in
this sense. One is seldom in a position to know and precisely evaluate all the
alternatives, because of uncertainties regarding the relevant probabilities and
cognitive limitations. Hence, a lot of people are not aiming for the best, but
for a good enough alternative. Think of your decision to meet a friend for din-
ner. Most people browse their directory and call the first friend with whom
it seems sufficiently interesting to spend the evening. Simon (1957) called
this type of behavior satisficing. The idea is that individuals have certain
aspiration levels and choose the first alternative that meets these standards.
Because of that, the resulting choices are, in general, less than optimal. There
may have been friends in your directory with whom you could have spent an
even better evening.
</p>
<p>At first glance, satisficing seems to contradict the idea of maximization
and thereby the concept that one should start by identifying and evaluating
all opportunity costs. However, advocates of the maximization approach
have argued that the opposite is the case: satisficing is optimization where
all opportunity costs, including the costs of processing information and op-
timization, are considered. Looking for the best friend to spend the evening
with may be so complicated and time consuming that, in the end, one has</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188 8 Costs
</p>
<p>dinner alone. It is disputed, however, whether this is a legitimate defense
of the idea of maximization. It brings the whole concept close to a tautol-
ogy, because it comes with the risk of explaining every type of behavior by
identifying arbitrary and non-falsifiable opportunity costs.
</p>
<p>What studies with monozygotic and dizygotic twins have shown is that the
tendency to satisfice or to maximize has a strong genetic component and that
people can be categorized into &ldquo;maximizers&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisficers.&rdquo; Interestingly,
maximizers tend to make better decisions than satisficers, but are less happy
with them. One explanation for this apparent paradox is that even maxi-
mizers tend to fail to identify the best alternative in complex environments,
but are more aware of the fact that they may have failed to achieve their goals.
Hence, they often feel regretful when they evaluate their choices. Therefore,
in the end, the satisficer goes to the first ok-looking restaurant with the first
ok-looking friend and spends a happy evening, whereas the maximizer con-
tinuously questions whether sushi with Sasha would have been better than
pizza with Paul.
</p>
<p>8.2 A Systematic Treatment of Costs
</p>
<p>One is now in a position to define costs in a systematic way. Costs are the sum of
factor inputs evaluated by their prices (be they monetary or opportunity costs).
</p>
<p>In the easiest case, there is only one input, whose quantity is denoted by q and
that can be purchased at a price (per unit) of r . In this case, costs are simply
C.q; r/ D q � r . If there are i D 1; : : : ; m different inputs with quantities denoted
by qi and prices by ri , the cost equation can be defined as:
</p>
<p>C.q1; : : : ; qm; r1; : : : rm/ D
m
X
</p>
<p>iD1
qi � ri :
</p>
<p>The cost equation is easy to specify, but it is not particularly interesting for eco-
nomic decision making. What one would like to understand is the relationship
between output and costs or, more precisely, between output and the minimum costs
that are necessary to produce this output. This information is given by the cost
function.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.1, Cost function A cost function C.yi / assigns the minimum costs
to the production of yi units of a good i .
</p>
<p>In principle, it would be possible to define certain properties of cost functions
and see what they imply for the behavior of firms in different market contexts.
Economists, however, usually take a detour and establish a causal link between the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.2 A Systematic Treatment of Costs 189
</p>
<p>cost equation and the cost function, because it allows them to see how the cost
function relates to the physical properties of production. This is important for as-
sessing, for example, the effects of technological change on market behavior or
market structure, and so on.
</p>
<p>Production is, first of all, a physical activity that transforms matter from one state
into another, generally more desirable state. The rules of transformation are sum-
marized by the so-called technology of production. It is the set of all technologically
feasible input-output combinations and is &ndash; mathematically speaking &ndash; a set. The
boundary, or &ldquo;outer hull,&rdquo; of this set is the subset of all productively efficient input-
output combinations because at a point along the outer hull it is (for given quantities
of inputs) only possible to increase the production of one good by lowering the pro-
duction of some other good. This outer hull is called the production-possibility
frontier. It can &ndash; under certain conditions &ndash; be represented by a function that one
calls the production function.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.2, Production function A production function relates the output of
a production process to the necessary inputs. It assigns the productively efficient
output to any combination of inputs.
</p>
<p>Digression 20. Firms Bas Production Functions and Firms as Organizations; How
Efficient Can One Possibly Be?
</p>
<p>At this point, it is important to scrutinize the basic assumption that a point
along the production function can actually be reached. Underlying this as-
sumption is the view that firms are able to organize economic activities within
the firm in a perfectly efficient way. Historically, economists were not partic-
ularly interested in the management structures of firms and treated the firm as
a black box that entered their analysis as a production function. This simpli-
fication might be useful, if the primary focus of the analysis is the interaction
of supply and demand on markets. As one knows from the short introduction
into the philosophy of science, every scientific theory has to make simplifying
assumptions; the question is if the simplifications are useful.
</p>
<p>The firm-as-production-function view was challenged when economists
started to realize that they cannot explain the existence of firms as subsets of
transactions that replace decentralized market transactions with more central-
ized forms of governance (see Sect. 6.2 for more detailed information). Since
then, a large body of literature on the internal organization of firms and the
boundaries between firms and markets has emerged that allows one to bet-
ter understand under what conditions and with what kind of organizational
structure companies can get to or close to the production function. This is-
sue boils down to understanding if firms can organize economic activities in
a way that all interdependencies, which are internal to the firm, are internal-
ized (i.e. no firm-internal externalities exist). The strands of the literature that
focus on these problems are called principal-agent theory, contract theory or</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>190 8 Costs
</p>
<p>merely theory of the firm. The important point is that one has to conceptually
distinguish between the production function and the relationship between in-
puts and outputs, which exists given the (possibly imperfect) way economic
activities are organized within a firm.
</p>
<p>Economists and business economists are usually no experts in the physical laws
of production. Nevertheless, they have to be able to communicate with engineers
and scientists (who are experts in respect of these laws of production) in order to
understand how the production process influences the structure of the cost func-
tion. The idea is relatively straightforward and can be exemplified by means of a
(hypothetical) production technology that transforms one input, labor (l), into one
output, apples (y). The input price is equal to the market wage (w). The production
function can then be defined as y D Y.l/, and the structure of the function Y.:/
summarizes the &ldquo;laws&rdquo; for transforming labor into the number of apples picked.
A potentially interesting question is by how much the number of apples picked is
increased by one additional unit of labor.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.3, Marginal product The marginal product of a production function
measures the change in production y that is caused by an additional unit of an
input l .
</p>
<p>In order to access the powerful toolbox of Calculus, one has to assume that in-
finitesimal changes in inputs and outputs are possible and that the production func-
tion is continuously differentiable. These assumptions allow one to approximate
the marginal product by taking the partial derivatives of the production function.
Formally, let dl be a change in labor input and dy the associated change in output.
With only one input and a marginal change in l , dl ! 0, the marginal product is
given by
</p>
<p>dy
</p>
<p>dl
D Y 0.l/;
</p>
<p>where Y 0.:/ is the partial derivative of Y.:/. If several inputs q1; : : : ; qm are needed
for production, the production function can be denoted as Y.q1; : : : ; qm/, and the
marginal product for an infinitesimal change in input i , dqi , is given by
</p>
<p>dy

<p>dqi

<p>Costs are inputs evaluated by input prices. The production function establishes
a link between inputs and outputs. If one had the opposite link between output and
input, one would be close to the solution of the problem: if one could associate a
level of input with each level of output, the only thing that one would have to do
is to multiply the input by the input price to get the cost function. However, the
opposite link can be readily established as the inverse function of the production
function. It gives an answer to the question of how much input one needs for a
given output. Multiply this input by the factor price and you have the cost function.
More formally, assume the production function is monotonically increasing (i.e.
more input generates more output), let L be the set of all possible inputs and Y
be the set of all possible outputs. The production function is a mapping from L to
Y, Y W L ! Y. Denote by L.y/ the inverse function of the production function,
L.y/ D Y �1.y/. It is a mapping from Y to L, L W Y ! L. Figure 8.2 illustrates.

<p>This figure displays the relationship between labor input (l , along the abscissa)
and output (y, along the ordinate). People are used to following the convention
of interpreting the variable on the abscissa as the explanatory variable and the one
on the ordinate as the explained variable. This is the interpretation as a production
function: how much output can be produced with l units of labor input? Graphically
speaking, one looks at the figure from the abscissa to the ordinate, indicated by the
stylized eye in Fig. 8.2a. One can, of course, also look at the figure from another
angle. In Fig. 8.2b, the stylized eye indicates that one interprets y as the explanatory</p>

<p>and l as the explained variable. The question that one asks then is how much labor
input one needs, if one wants to produce y units of output. The answer to this
question is given by the inverse of the production function.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.4, Cost function for one-output-one-input technologies The cost

Now, output (y) is drawn along the abscissa and input (l) along the ordinate. The

<p>cost function (see upper graph) is a multiple of the inverse production function (see
lower graph).
</p>
<p>This link between the production and the cost function allows one to understand
how cost functions are related to production technologies. Two qualifying remarks
have to be made in order to get the bigger picture.
</p>
<p>� First, the assumption that the firm can rent or buy inputs at given input prices
reveals the implicit assumption that factor markets are perfectly competitive. If
the firm has market power on some input market (for example, if it is the only
major employer in the region), then the relationship between costs and technol-
ogy is no longer so straightforward and is also determined by the power of the
firm to set wages as a function of labor input.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 8.3 Inverse production function and cost function
</p>
<p>� Second, it is, of course, a completely ✍unrealistic assumption that production re-
quires only one input. Some production processes lead to co-production, such
as when crude oil is separated into its different marketable components. Multi-
input production gives rise to the more complex question of how to determine
the optimal mix of inputs. This optimal mix is influenced by the technologi-
cally determined degree to which the different inputs can be substituted for each
other and the input prices. Manufacturing, for example, can be relatively capital-
intensive or relatively labor-intensive, and the capital-labor ratio depends on the
relative prices of capital and labor. In order to determine the cost function, in this
case, one has to solve what is called a cost-minimization problem. For under-
standing this and the following chapters, it is sufficient to work with the insight
that one gets from the one-input-one-output model.
</p>
<p>With this understanding of a cost function, one can now move on and use it as
an explanatory tool for different theories of firm behavior in markets. As one will
see throughout the following chapters, different types of costs will turn out to be
important explanatory factors. Therefore, this subchapter will introduce them now,
filling the toolbox with additional tools that one will use later on.
</p>
<p>If one takes total costs and distributes them equally among all the units that one
produces, one gets the average costs of production:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>194 8 Costs
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.5, Average costs The average costs of production equal the total
costs of production divided by the quantity produced, AC.y/ D C.y/=y.
</p>
<p>Some costs vary with, and some are independent of, the quantity produced. Take
computer software or cars as examples. Before one can sell a new product, one has
to incur development costs. These costs are independent of the number of licenses
or vehicles that one produces and sells; they are a prerequisite for their production.
The reason why these costs do not vary with the volume produced is technological.
They have the property that, from an ex-ante perspective (before one makes the
investment decision), they are zero, but immediately &ldquo;jump up,&rdquo; if one decides to
develop and sell the new product. One calls these costs technological fixed costs.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.6, Technological fixed costs The technological fixed costs of produc-
tion are the costs that occur once a firm starts production and they are independent
of the volume of production,
</p>
<p>TFC.y/ D
(
</p>
<p>0; y D 0
FC; y &gt; 0
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>Costs are related to prices and prices exist within an institutional framework
as part of a contract. This is why costs can also be independent of production
volume, because of contractual reasons. Take a long-term rental agreement as an
example: the rent has to be paid throughout the duration of the contract, irrespective
of the firm&rsquo;s performance on markets. Such costs have the peculiar feature that they
are fixed throughout the duration of the contract, but can be variable over longer
periods of time or with different contractual arrangements. These costs are called
contractual fixed costs.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.7, Contractual fixed costs The contractual fixed costs of production
are the costs that are independent of production: CFC.y/ D FC for all y � 0.
</p>
<p>The major differences between contractual and technological fixed costs are,
therefore, their causes and their behavior around y D 0. Technological fixed costs
can become contractual fixed costs, for example, if the engineers who develop a
new product have long-term contracts. For a lot of economic applications, it does
not matter whether fixed costs are contractual or technological, but there are some
important exceptions. If the difference is without relevance, one simply calls them
fixed costs; otherwise, one explicitly refers to their cause.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.8, Fixed costs The fixed costs of production include the technologi-
cal and the contractual fixed costs.
</p>
<p>Contractual fixed costs are also costs that cannot be recovered: once one has
signed the contract, one has to pay them. This is true for all costs that are necessary
for production, as well as those that occurred in the past. The fact that the monthly</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.2 A Systematic Treatment of Costs 195
</p>
<p>payments fixed in a long-term rental agreement will occur in the future is irrelevant
for this, because the legally relevant act, the signature of the contract, happened in
the past.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.9, Sunk costs Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred
at a given point in time and thus cannot be recovered.
</p>
<p>It can be argued that sunk costs are, necessarily, fixed costs: from today&rsquo;s per-
spective, they cannot be influenced and are, therefore, independent of the volume
of production. However, if all costs are opportunity costs, then sunk costs are not
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; costs at all, because they refer to events in the past and are, therefore, ir-
relevant for one&rsquo;s decisions. They are like gravity: one can complain that it exists
and that it makes flying difficult, but the only thing one can do is to cope with it.
</p>
<p>The costs that vary with production are called variable costs. If one is in the
fruit-picking business and one hires fruit pickers every morning, then labor costs
are variable on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.10, Variable costs The variable costs of production are the costs that
vary with the quantity produced: VC.y/ D C.y/ � FC .
</p>
<p>One can now look for averages in fixed and variable costs, which motivates the
following two definitions:
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.11, Average fixed costs The average fixed costs of production equal
the fixed costs of production divided by the quantity produced: AFC.y/ D FC=y.
</p>
<p>The concept of average fixed costs can be applied to both contractual and tech-
nological fixed costs.
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.12, Average variable costs The average variable costs of production
equal the variable costs of production divided by the quantity produced: AVC.y/ D
VC.y/=y.
</p>
<p>Last, but not least, one might be interested in the costs that result if one produces
an additional unit of output:
</p>
<p>I Definition 8.13, Marginal costs The marginal costs of production are the costs
that result from the production of an additional unit of output: MC.y/ D
dC.y/=dy.
</p>
<p>Marginal costs MC.y/ are approximately equal to the partial derivative of the
cost function C 0.y/, if one allows for infinitesimal changes in inputs and outputs.
Marginal costs are a key concept in mainstream economics, because they play a
prominent role in determining the behavior of firms, which seek to maximize their
profits.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>196 8 Costs
</p>
<p>The above office-rental and fruit-picker examples suggest that the relationship
between fixed and variable costs is a matter of time frame and contract structure.
As soon as one has signed a contract with a specific duration, the costs that emerge
from this contract are sunk and, therefore, fixed during the term of the contract,
but variable for larger time spans. Thus, the question of which inputs contribute
to fixed costs and which to variable costs depends on the contract structure and the
contract structure may be culture-specific. In countries with extensive employment-
protection laws, it is difficult to fire employees on short notice, so one gets a certain
downward rigidity. In countries with hire-and-fire cultures, it is much easier to
adjust one&rsquo;s workforce on short notice. The same is true for capital, where one needs
to understand the contract structure in order to know whether rental agreements,
etc., contribute to sunk and fixed or variable costs. In the long run, however, all costs
are either variable costs or technological fixed costs. (For nerds: strictly speaking,
technological fixed costs are a special case of variable costs, because they depend
on production, even if only at y D 0. Classifying them as such, however, makes it
harder to build an understanding about the underlying economic phenomena, which
is why one summarizes them in a specific category.)
</p>
<p>Digression 21. The Profits for the AppleWatch Are . . .
</p>
<p>According to the news agency Reuters (May 01, 2015), Apple Inc&rsquo;s Watch
has the lowest ratio of hardware costs to retail price of any Apple phone. The
hardware costs of the Sport edition was about 24% of the suggested retail
price (29&ndash;38% for Apple&rsquo;s other products). The suggested US retail price for
the watch is $349, and the hardware costs (including manufacturing costs of
$2.50) amount to $83.70.
</p>
<p>One could argue that this is a nice profit margin and a proof of Apple&rsquo;s
strong monopoly position in the industry. Nevertheless, be careful! It may be
safe to say that Apple will make a nice profit with its new product line, but to
conclude from the above report that it amounts to $265.30 per watch would
be premature.
</p>
<p>Based on the costs analysis, one knows that total costs consist of variable
plus fixed costs and that hardware and manufacturing costs are usually vari-
able costs. Hence, $265.30 is closer to what we have called producer surplus.
</p>
<p>Fixed costs are usually substantial for products like the Apple Watch, be-
cause they include costs for research and development and also for marketing.
What makes the above numbers almost impossible to interpret is the fact that
one does not know to which extent these costs are already figured into the
hardware costs.
</p>
<p>Here is an example why this is complicated. Apple buys the processor
from Samsung. If Samsung did all the research and development, these costs
must already be figured into the price Samsung charges Apple for this part.
The same is true for all the other components that make up an Apple Watch.
Therefore, if Apple mainly assembles components developed by other firms,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>References 197
</p>
<p>a substantial part of the technological fixed costs are not contractual fixed
costs from the perspective of Apple. In this case, the per-unit profit is closer to
$265.30. But wait! Maybe the contract between Apple and Samsung specifies
a so-called two-part tariff where Apple makes a fixed, upfront payment and
pays a lower price for each processor. Such a contract would bring the price
structure more closely in line with Samsung&rsquo;s cost structure, which may be
beneficial from an efficiency point of view. Nevertheless, if this were the
case, the upfront payment should not count as part of the variable hardware
costs . . . unless Apple divides them among the expected sales, which again
would make them appear in the hardware costs.
</p>
<p>To make a long story short: one should be very cautious when reading
news like the above, because the information is usually much too crude to
draw any reliable conclusions about profits.

</p>
<p>9.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The natural price or the price of free competition . . . is the lowest which can be taken. [It]
is the lowest which the sellers can commonly afford to take, and at the same time continue
their business. (Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations (1776[1991]), Book I, Chapter VII)
</p>
<p>This chapter will take a closer look at the supply decision of a firm that sells in
a market with perfect competition. To make the problem manageable, one has to
specify the objective of the firm and say a few words about its ownership structure
as well as its internal organization.
</p>
<p>The standard assumption ✍in the literature is that firms seek to maximize profits.
If p is the price of some good produced by the firm, y is the quantity produced
and C.y/ are the costs of production, then the profits are �.y/ D p � y � C.y/ D
R.y/�C.y/, where R.y/ stands for revenues. One way to think about this objective
function is in terms of the interests of the owners. Assume that a single person
owns the firm and uses it as a vehicle to maximize her income. What objective
would she try to give the firm in order to pursue her goal? Obviously, the increase
in income that the owner can extract from the firm is equal to the firm&rsquo;s profit: the
owner deploys capital and labor, which costs her C.y/ for y units of output, and

</p>
<p>she gets the revenues of the firm, p � y. Therefore, the surplus or the increase in
income is equal to the firm&rsquo;s profit. Hence, if income-maximizing owners invest
in firms, it is in their best interest that the firms maximize profits. If owners invest
in firms because they want to reach something else, then the imputed objective
may be different. Nevertheless, it is a good starting point to conjecture that most
shareholders invest in corporations because they want to make money.
</p>
<p>Digression 22. The LimitsB of Profit Maximization: Information, Contracts, and the
Organization of Firms
</p>
<p>The idea that income-maximizing owners would like to make sure that the
managers of the firm maximize profits is simple and powerful. However, it
is the source of a lot of controversy for both normative and positive reasons.
From the positive point of view, it is sometimes argued that firms do not, in
fact, maximize their profits. Deviations from this objective may have several
reasons. They can be a result of imperfect information about costs and rev-
enues. Limited information is definitely a relevant problem and it may lead
to decisions that are apparently not in line with profit maximization. Nev-
ertheless, it does not falsify the objective per se. As previous chapters have
shown, it is the purpose of managerial accounting to provide information to
support decisions. If the information is bad, the decisions are bad, and the
first impulse should be to develop a better accounting system, not to abandon
profit maximization.
</p>
<p>Another important reason for deviations from profit maximization results
from the fact that firms are usually complex networks of individuals with their
own objectives. The key question then becomes whether it is possible to align
the interests of the owners with the interests of the workers. Take the CEO
of a firm that is not managed by the owner and assume further that both, the
owner and the manager, want to maximize their incomes. The income of the
manager depends on the contract, so it becomes a problem of contract design
whether the owner&rsquo;s and the manager&rsquo;s income maximizations coincide. (One
can think of such a contract as an incentive mechanism. An optimal contract
is one that creates no externalities between manager and owner.) The key
question is, therefore, how such a contract has to be designed to make sure
that the manager internalizes the interests of the owner. If the contract is ill-
designed, the manager will use her discretionary power to maximize her own
income, which is not compatible with the owner&rsquo;s income maximization and,
therefore, is in conflict with profit maximization. An example might be a
contract with bonus payments that incentivizes short-term profits, despite the
fact that they are in conflict with the long-term interests of the firm.
</p>
<p>To simplify things, one assumes that owners want to maximize income, that
contracts perfectly align owners&rsquo; and managers&rsquo; interests, and that the accounting
system is sufficiently precise to allow for a realistic view of costs and revenues.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.1 Introduction 203
</p>
<p>Hence, firms maximize profits. This case acts like a benchmark. If one understands
the benchmark, one can get a better understanding of the effects of deviations from
it.
</p>
<p>It makes sense to state the objective function explicitly. The firm maximizes
profits by the choice of the quantity of the good produced. Formally, it is expressed
as follows:
</p>
<p>max
y
</p>
<p>p � y � C.y/:
</p>
<p>The assumption of perfect competition enters the above choice problem, because
the price is treated as a parameter, which means that the firm takes it as given. The
above formulation also assumes both that the quantity produced and the quantity
sold is identical and that firms do not produce for or sell from stocks.
</p>
<p>The concept of marginal revenues will be helpful in understanding optimal firm
decisions.
</p>
<p>I Definition 9.1, Marginal revenues The marginal revenue of production is the rev-
enue the firm makes by an additional unit of production: MR.y/ D dR.y/=dy.
</p>
<p>What are the implications of the assumption of profit maximization for the sup-
ply decision of the firm? The following thought experiment allows one to gain a
better understanding. Assume that the firm produces a quantity such that marginal
revenue is larger than marginal cost and marginal costs are strictly positive. What
would the effect on profits of an increase in production by one unit be? Given
that profit is revenues minus costs, profit must increase, if marginal revenues ex-
ceed marginal costs, so it would be rational to increase production, because the firm
would make more money with the additional unit than it would cost. Next, assume
that the firm produces a quantity such that the marginal revenues are smaller than
the marginal costs. In this case, profit would go down, because the next unit of
production costs more than the firm would get for it on the market. Therefore, it
would be rational to reduce production. These two observations pin down the profit-
maximizing behavior of a firm: the optimal quantity is the one where marginal
revenues are equal to marginal costs.
</p>
<p>This condition can also be derived analytically, by setting the first derivative
of the profit function equal to zero. Given that the price is fixed for a firm on a
competitive market (the firm is a price-taker), the marginal revenues are equal to
the price of the good, MR.y/ D p, and one gets:
</p>
<p>� 0.y/ D p � C 0.y/ D p �MC.y/ D 0:
</p>
<p>Denote the quantity of the good that fulfills this condition by y�. This result is a
very important finding in the theory of firm behavior: a profit-maximizing firm on
a competitive market produces according to the &ldquo;price-equals-marginal-costs&rdquo; rule,
because marginal revenue is equal to the price under perfect competition. This rule
has several implications that the following paragraphs will discuss. Its applicability
also depends on several factors that one has to make explicit for an in-depth under-
standing of its role in the theory of firm behavior. I will start with the implications.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>204 9 A Second Look at Firm Behavior Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>The first and most important implication, for an economist, is the link between
the cost and supply functions. The condition p D MC.y/ formally establishes
a relationship between price p and quantity y. The supply function of a firm es-
tablishes the same type of relationship with y D y.p/. It maps each price onto
a quantity produced by the firm. If one looks at the inverse of the marginal-cost
function, one gets y D MC�1.p/. But this mapping has prices as domain and
quantities as codomain. This mapping described by the supply function has quan-
tities as its domain and prices as its codomain. The implication of this is that these
two mappings are inverse to each other and that a competitive firm&rsquo;s supply func-
tion is identical to its inverse marginal-cost function. When one observes a firm&rsquo;s
market behavior, one can &ldquo;look through&rdquo; the supply decision and get information
about the firm&rsquo;s marginal costs.
</p>
<p>This finding also allows for a more in-depth understanding of the willingness-to-
sell concept, which Chap. 5 introduced: I have argued that one can interpret a point
along the supply function as the minimum price the producer has to get in order to
be willing to sell an additional unit of the good. This price, as we have seen, is equal
to the marginal costs of producing this unit, which makes perfect sense: marginal
costs measure how much it costs to produce an additional unit of the good. If one
is paid more than that, one makes a profit with this unit, if one is paid less, one
takes a loss. Therefore, one is indifferent between selling and not selling, if one
gets exactly one&rsquo;s marginal costs.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;price-equals-marginal-costs&rdquo;B rule also has important managerial implica-
tions: In order to be able to behave in accordance with this rule, a manager needs
information about the market price and the marginal-cost function. This has impli-
cations for the organization of her company: in addition to the factory that produces
the goods that the firm sells, the firm needs a controlling department that collects
information about costs as well as current (and maybe also expected future) market
prices. The organization of a competitive firm is not very complicated. However,
getting the controlling correct is crucial for the firm, because the quality of decisions
depends on the accuracy of the information about marginal costs.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, life on competitive markets, as either a manager or an economist,
is not as simple as the above rule suggests. Next, one has to put the &ldquo;price-equals-
marginal-costs&rdquo; rule into perspective. I will discuss three aspects in the following
subchapter: technological conditions under which perfect competition works, short-
versus long-run decisions, and the relationship between firm and market supply.
</p>
<p>9.2 The Relationship Between Production Technology and
Market Structure
</p>
<p>As this chapter has already shown, the profit-maximizing production decision of a
firm can be characterized by the condition:
</p>
<p>� 0.y�/ D p � C 0.y�/ D p �MC.y�/ D 0:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.2 Production Technology and Market Structure 205
</p>
<p>I will scrutinize this approach from a purely technical point of view and discuss
the economic implications thereafter. This approach illustrates how a back-and-
forth between economic thinking and mathematical reasoning can improve one&rsquo;s
understanding of the economy.
</p>
<p>One may remember, from one&rsquo;s mathematics classes in high school, that the so-
called first-order conditions are necessary, but not sufficient, for the characterization
of a maximum. The only thing that a first derivative of zero guarantees is that the
function has a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; point, which can be a maximum, a minimum or a point of
inflection. In order to make sure that one characterizes a maximum, one has to
check the so-called second-order conditions, i.e. one has to check if
</p>
<p>� 00.y/ D �C 00.y/
</p>
<p>fulfills a certain property at the potential optimum. The second-order condition
says something about the curvature of the function. In order to make sure that
the first-order condition characterizes a maximum, one has to make sure that the
profit function is &ldquo;hump shaped&rdquo; or, more technically, strictly concave. (In addition,
one has to make sure that there is an interior optimum. A technical condition that
guarantees this is p &gt; MC.0/ and p &lt; limy!1 MC.y/.) This is guaranteed if the
second derivative of the profit function is negative,
</p>
<p>� 00.y/ D �C 00.y/ &lt; 0 , C 00.y/ &gt; 0:
</p>
<p>Figure 9.1 illustrates this case.
The upper part of Fig. 9.1 shows the profit of a firm for all possible production
</p>
<p>levels. It is inversely u-shaped. The first-order condition identifies the quantity
where the slope of the function is zero, which characterizes the maximum profit.
The lower part of Fig. 9.1 disentangles the profit into revenues and costs. The
straight line represents revenues as a function of y. Revenues are linear in produc-
tion, because it is simply the product of an exogenous price and the endogenous
quantity of the good. Costs increase disproportionally. Profit in Fig. 9.1 is equal to
the vertical difference between the revenue and the cost curve. What the firm tries
to do is to identify the output where this vertical difference is at its maximum. This
point is at the place where both functions have the same slope. The slope of the
revenue function is p and the slope of the cost function is MC.y/.
</p>
<p>In concluding that purely technical argument, is there anything one can learn
from this condition as an economist? First of all, one can see that the condition
restricts the class of admissible cost functions to those that increase overproportion-
ally in production. Hence, the marginal costs of production increase in the quantity
produced. Here is an example: assume that one invests time to study for the final
exam. The more time one spends, the better one&rsquo;s expected grade becomes. It is rel-
atively easy to pass, but it becomes more and more difficult to get the best possible
grade. This property is nicely reflected by an application of the so-called 80-20 rule
(also called the Pareto principle), which states that, for many events, 80% of the
effects come from 20% of the causes. Applied to the example, it would say that one</p>

<p>gets 80% of the output in 20% of the time, and the additional 20% of output in the
remaining 80% of the time. This principle applies to a large number of production
processes, and intellectual or physical skills are only one example. If one exploits
natural resources, it is usually relatively easy at the beginning and gets increasingly
difficult, when the source becomes depleted. Increasing the crop on a given piece
of land is relatively easy at the beginning but, the larger the crop, the more difficult
it gets to further increase it, and so on.
</p>
<p>The above arguments used technological explanations for increasing marginal
costs and this is exactly one of the reasons why I have linked costs with production
functions. Given that input markets are competitive, the structure of the cost func-
tion is determined by the structure of the production function, because they are, in
the one-factor example (up to a scaling factor, which is determined by input prices),
inverse to each other. Increasing marginal costs exist, if the marginal product de-
creases, i.e. if it gets more difficult to increase production the more one is already
producing.
</p>
<p>Assume that marginal costs are decreasing. In this case, the first-order condition
characterizes a minimum. What are the economic implications of this finding?
Figure 9.2 illustrates this case.

<p>208 9 A Second Look at Firm Behavior Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 shows revenues (straight line) and costs (curved line) as functions of
output. What one can see is that the output level, where price equals marginal costs,
now characterizes the profit minimum and the marginal-cost curve is downward-
sloping. At this point, the firm basically has two strategies. It can leave the market
and make zero profits (arrow to the left) at y D 0, or it can try to grow as large as
possible (arrow to the right). If the firm is successful in growing beyond the point
ybe , it starts making profits. However, the firm should not stop here; the figure
reveals that the difference between revenues and costs get larger the more the firm
produces. Therefore, it is the best strategy for the firm to grow as large as possible.
However, this strategy is incompatible with the assumption that the firm takes prices
as given because of its smallness relative to the rest of the market. If a firm gets so
large that it can serve the whole market, then it is able to influence the market price.
The assumptions of perfect competition and decreasing marginal costs are logically
incompatible.
</p>
<p>The implication of this inconsistency is that perfectly competitive markets are no
one-size-fits-all institution that can be used to organize economic activities. Such
markets can only sustain themselves if the industry produces with the &ldquo;right&rdquo; type
of technology, and an important number of industries do not fit into this picture.
</p>
<p>The intermediate case, of constant marginal costs, deserves some attention, as
well. Figure 9.3 shows revenues and costs as functions of output.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.3 The Short Versus the Long Run 209
</p>
<p>Constant marginal costs imply that the cost function is linear. One can denote
it as C.y/ D c � y with c &gt; 0. There are three possible cases: the cost function
is steeper than the revenue function, c &gt; p; flatter, c &lt; p; or both have the same
slope. The economic implications of these scenarios are straightforward: the best
the firm can do, if c &gt; p, is to shut down its business and to leave the market.
If c &lt; p, however, the opposite is the case. The firm should grow indefinitely,
which is in conflict with the assumption of perfect competition. Thus, there is only
one case left, where perfect competition is compatible with constant marginal costs:
c D p. In this case, the firm is indifferent between all production levels, because
it makes zero profits irrespective of how much it produces. (At some other point, I
explain in detail why zero profits do not imply zero gains from trade. Zero profits
imply that equity owners cannot expect a rate of return that exceeds the market
interest rate for a similar investment. Hence, one can assume that the firm continues
to produce, even with zero profits.)
</p>
<p>9.3 The Short Versus the Long Run
</p>
<p>I have argued in Chap. 8 that, depending on the time frame and the term structure of
contracts, some costs of the firm can be contractually fixed and some are variable.
The &ldquo;price-equals-marginal-costs&rdquo; rule made the implicit assumption that the firm
is active on the market. However, it can always decide to leave the market and this
may be a wise decision, if the losses that occur when leaving the market are smaller
than the losses would be, if it stays. This statement may sound dubious at first, so
one has to dig a little deeper to understand what exactly is meant by it.
</p>
<p>Assume that a firm produces with technological fixed costs FC &gt; 0 and variable
costs:
</p>
<p>C.y/ D
(
</p>
<p>0; for y D 0
VC.y/C FC; for y &gt; 0 ;
</p>
<p>and further assume that marginal costs are increasing. This situation is depicted in
Fig. 9.4 with the example of a variable cost function being VC.y/ D 0:5 �y2. Please
note that this function implies that the marginal costs MC.y/ D y for all y &gt; 0.
</p>
<p>The horizontal line (p) is the market price and the linear monotonic line repre-
sents the marginal costs. If the firm decides to stay in the market, it will choose the
quantity that equals price and marginal costs, indicated by y� in the figure. Total
revenues for an output of y� are p � y�, and can be represented by the rectangular
area 0pAy�0. Given that marginal costs are the first derivative of the variable-cost
function, the triangular area 0Ay�0, under the marginal-cost curve, represents the
variable costs. Hence, the producer surplus, PS.y�/, is given by the triangular area
0pA0 and is equal to revenues minus variable costs.
</p>
<p>This is a general property. One may have wondered why the measure for the
gains from trade of a firm is called producer surplus instead of profit. The reason
is that the profit includes fixed costs, whereas producer surplus does not. One can</p>

<p>establish the following relationship between profit and producer surplus:
</p>
<p>�.y/ D PS.y/� FC:
</p>
<p>It follows that producer surplus and profits coincide, if fixed costs are zero, FC D
0. In this case, the area 0pA0 is also the profit of the firm. However, if production
requires upfront investments, then the profit is lower than the producer surplus.
</p>
<p>The easiest way to see how technological fixed costs (remember that these costs
can be avoided by producing a quantity of 0) influence profits is by adding the
average-cost curve to the picture. It is equal to
</p>
<p>AC.y/ D VC.y/
y
</p>
<p>C FC
y
</p>
<p>D 0:5 � y C FC
y
</p>
<p>;
</p>
<p>if y &gt; 0. A closer look at the expression reveals that it is u-shaped: the first term
is a linear, increasing function, whereas the second term is hyperbolic. Hence, the
sum must be u-shaped. Is there anything else that one can say about the average-
cost curve? Yes: it intersects with the marginal-cost curve at the minimum of the
average costs. To understand this intuitively, think of the range over which the
average-cost curve is declining. Within this range, marginal costs must be smaller
than average costs: if the average is declining at a given point, then the cost of the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.3 The Short Versus the Long Run 211
</p>
<p>last unit needs to be below the average costs up to this point. By the same token, if
the average-cost curve is increasing, then the costs of the last unit must be higher
than the average costs at any given point, because otherwise marginal costs would
not have sufficient &ldquo;leverage&rdquo; to bring up average costs.
</p>
<p>To see this algebraically, note that, applying the quotient rule, a necessary con-
dition for the minimum of the average-cost curve is
</p>
<p>AC 0.y/ D 0 , C
0.y/ � y � C.y/
</p>
<p>y2
D 0:
</p>
<p>For y &gt; 0, this condition can be simplified to
</p>
<p>C 0.y/ � y � C.y/ D 0;
</p>
<p>if one multiplies by y2 (which is possible because y &gt; 0). Dividing by y and
rearranging terms gives the desired result:
</p>
<p>C 0.y/ D C.y/
y
</p>
<p>, MC.y/ D AC.y/:
</p>
<p>(The same calculation can be carried out for average variable costs.) To illustrate,
Fig. 9.5 shows the marginal-cost curve and the average-cost curve for FC D 10.
</p>
<p>Note that AC.y/ D C.y/=y, or C.y/ D AC.y/ �y, which means that total costs
for any output y can be measured by the rectangular area 0ABy0.
</p>
<p>With this prerequisite, one can return to the relationship between producer sur-
plus and profit, or the role of technological fixed costs in firm behavior. Different
levels of technological fixed costs give rise to a family of average-cost curves, where
higher curves correspond to higher technological fixed costs.
</p>
<p>Figure 9.6 shows the marginal-cost curve and the family of average-cost curves
for different values of FC .
</p>
<p>There is one average-cost curve that is of particular interest: the one that inter-
sects with the marginal-cost curve exactly where price equals marginal costs. Call
this level of fixed costs FC 0. This situation is represented in Fig. 9.7.
</p>
<p>One already knows that total revenues are equal to 0pAy�0 at y� and that pro-
ducer surplus is equal to 0pA0. What one knows, in addition, is that total costs are
0pAy�0 at y�, so total profits are equal to zero. What is happening here is that the
producer surplus is sufficient to cover the technological fixed costs. If fixed costs
are lower, the firm stays in business and makes a profit. What happens, however, if
the technological fixed costs are higher? In this case, the firm would end up with a
negative profit or loss. Is there anything the firm can do about this loss? Yes, given
that one is talking about technological fixed costs, it can ex-ante (before it starts
the development process), anticipate that the producer surplus will be insufficient
to cover the technological fixed costs, at the expected market price, and stay out
of business. At this ex-ante stage, the total profit from staying out of business is
0, which is better than the loss that results from entering the market. This finding</p>

<p>leads to an important modification of the optimal supply decision. In the long run,
when all costs can be avoided by not entering the market, the optimal strategy of a
competitive firm is to determine the optimal quantity, according to the price-equals-
marginal-costs-rule, if the market price is (weakly) above the average costs, and
to stay out of the market otherwise. The individual supply function is, therefore,
identical to the inverse of the marginal-cost function, if the price is (weakly) larger
than average costs.
</p>
<p>One can now turn to a slightly modified case. Contrary to the above example,
assume that the firm has already entered a contractual arrangement that turns the
fixed into sunk costs, i.e. &ldquo;costs&rdquo; that cannot be avoided by shutting down the
business. In this case, the same analysis as in Fig. 9.7 applies, but the economic
consequences are different. For all levels of fixed costs FC &gt; FC 0 the firm makes
a loss, but this loss cannot be avoided by going out of business. Hence, the best
the firm can do is to minimize losses, which means sticking to the price-equals-
marginal-costs rule. This rule will lead to losses in the end, but they are smaller than
the loss that would occur with any other strategy, including going out of business.
Figure 9.8 compares the two scenarios.
</p>
<p>The upward-sloping function is the marginal-cost curve and the u-shaped func-
tion is the average-cost curve. The supply curve equals the section of the marginal-
cost curve above the average-cost curve, if the technological fixed costs are not yet</p>

</p>
<p>The above exampleL, B carved out the implications of the difference between tech-
nological and contractual fixed costs. Contractual fixed costs can, however, also
exist in situations where technological fixed costs are zero. Assume, for example,
that a farmer has a cherry orchard with a given number of trees. The only addi-
tional input that he needs at harvest time is labor. Assume also that the quantity
of cherries picked is increasing in the number of hours fruits are picked, but that
the increase is declining (it gets harder and harder to pick additional cherries). At a
given market wage, this &ldquo;picking technology&rdquo; creates increasing marginal costs of
fruit picking. If the farmer can hire fruit pickers on a daily spot market, this assump-
tion turns wage payments into variable costs. Assume, on the contrary, that a union
of fruit pickers negotiated a three months dismissal protection. In this case, labor
costs become fixed and sunk once the employment contract is signed. The analysis
of situations like this is qualitatively identical to the analysis above and the basic
understanding is simple: costs that the firm cannot influence have no significance
for the optimal behavior of the firm. Alternatively, to put it shortly: sunk costs are
sunk.
</p>
<p>At this point, a remark is in order about the role that sunk costs play in standard
economics. It is a generally accepted view that rational decision makers ignore sunk</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.3 The Short Versus the Long Run 215
</p>
<p>costs in their decisions: if one cannot influence them, they should be irrelevant for
one&rsquo;s decisions. One calls this the sunk-cost principle. Generally, it is a wise and
important normative principle: one should not care about the past, if one wants
to make rational decisions (but one should have a look at the digression below).
However, it is less clear that its predictive power in positive theory is very high. In
a number of cases, people care about sunk costs, even if they should not, according
to the sunk-cost principle.
</p>
<p>An example is the empirical phenomenon of mental accounting that describes
the tendency of individuals to keep different financial titles in different &ldquo;mental ac-
counts,&rdquo; and to evaluate the performance of the different titles separately, despite
of the fact that a rational decision maker should aggregate them and evaluate the
performance of the whole portfolio. For example, assume that someone made equal
investments in two stocks. If he sold them today, stock A would have gained CHF
5,000 and stock B would have lost CHF 5,000. Assume that he has to sell a stock
because he needs some extra liquidity. A rational person would take the past per-
formance of stocks into consideration, only if he thinks that past performance is
correlated with future performance, such that one can learn from the past. Other-
wise, past gains and losses should be irrelevant for one&rsquo;s decision to sell stock A
or stock B . However, empirical evidence shows that most people have a preference
for selling the winning stock A, which could only be rationalized, if the good past
performance is an indicator for bad future performance. Much more likely is the
explanation that they hold both stocks in different mental accounts and react emo-
tionally to realized losses and gains. Capitalizing the gains from selling stock A
gives one pleasure and, at the same time, it allows one to avoid the confrontation
with the pain of realizing the losses of stock B . These emotional predispositions
may influence one&rsquo;s behavior and make it incompatible with the sunk-cost princi-
ple. The tendency to invest additional resources into losing accounts or to &ldquo;throw
good money after bad&rdquo; is sometimes also called the sunk-cost fallacy.
</p>
<p>Digression 23. Evolution, Emotions, ˆand Sunk Costs: When Caring about Sunk
Costs Can Be Beneficial
</p>
<p>It appears that deviations from the sunk-cost principle are always bad. How-
ever, if this were the case, one may wonder why humans&rsquo; brains evolved in a
way that make us vulnerable to the sunk-cost fallacy. Recent research in evo-
lutionary biology challenges the theory that such behavior is necessarily bad.
Take the so-called ultimatum game as an example. In this game, two players
have to decide how to divide a sum of money. The first player can propose
how to split the sum between the two players and the other player can then
accept or reject the offer. If she accepts, the money will be split according to
the proposal; if she rejects, neither player receives anything. According to the
sunk-cost principle, the second player should accept any positive amount, be-
cause the proposal of the first player is in the past and cannot be influenced.
Nevertheless, with this logic, a selfish player 1 should offer the minimum</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216 9 A Second Look at Firm Behavior Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>amount possible. Hence, the sunk-cost principle guarantees that player 2 gets
almost nothing.
</p>
<p>This prediction has been consistently tested and falsified in the laboratory.
It turns out that subjects in the role of player 2 very often reject small offers,
because they find them unfair or even outrageous. However, rejecting positive
offers violates the sunk-cost principle. In the end one walks home without any
money when one could at lease have had some. From an evolutionary point
of view, however, the apparently dysfunctional emotions of anger, frustration
or rage that lead one to turn down flimsy offers may play a very functional
role. Within a community, reputation takes on a vital role in human interac-
tion, because it is not unlikely for one to be in a position to do business with
the same person more than once or with people who have heard about one&rsquo;s
previous business dealings. Thus, player 2 would like to commit to a strat-
egy that turns down bad offers because, if player 1 knows that bad offers will
be turned down, he has an incentive to make better ones. The problem is, of
course, how to make such an announcement credible. An important role emo-
tions seem to be playing in regulating human interactions is exactly this: to
make credible commitments possible. Assume player 2 reacts with anger and
frustration to bad offers, so that he happily rejects them and player 1 knows
this (either by introspection or because he knows player 2). This knowledge
would motivate player 1 to make a better offer, with the consequence that the
resulting allocation is more egalitarian, which gives an &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; player
2 a fitness advantage over a purely &ldquo;rational&rdquo; player 2. What this example
shows is that one&rsquo;s behavioral dispositions and emotional reactions evolved
over a long period of time and that they are usually functional adaptions to
certain environments. In different environments, however, they may become
dysfunctional. This is why it would be completely premature to classify the
sunk-cost principle as the only rational way to make decisions; it all depends
on the context.
</p>
<p>9.4 Firm andMarket Supply
</p>
<p>This chapter has, up until this point, concentrated on the behavior of an individual
firm. It has also shown that one can interpret the individual supply function as the
inverse of the marginal-cost function, if the market price exceeds a certain bench-
mark, which is defined by the relevant average costs of the firm. It has neglected,
thus far, to cover the relationship between individual and market supply. The as-
sumption that firms seek to maximize profits allows one to say a little bit more than
one already knows from Sect. 4.2.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.4 Firm and Market Supply 217
</p>
<p>Section 4.2 worked under the assumption that there is a given number of firms l
in each market i . In this case, market supply for a good j was defined as
</p>
<p>yi .pi ; r; w/ D
l
X
</p>
<p>jD1
y
j
i .pi ; r; w/:
</p>
<p>Depending on market prices, fixed and sunk costs, the optimal policy of a firm can
lead to positive profits, zero profits or even losses (during a period of time when
contractual obligations restrain firms). Assume now that, for the given number of
firms l , profits are strictly positive. Under certain conditions, such a situation is
unsustainable in the long run, if firms maximize profits. Positive profits in a market
attract additional firms to enter the market.
</p>
<p>A good example Lis Lidl and Aldi, two German grocery stores that entered the
Swiss market a few years ago. The old situation, in which two major incumbents,
Coop and Migros, divided the lion&rsquo;s share of the Swiss market, was no longer sus-
tainable after Switzerland signed the Bilateral Agreements II with the European
Union, which became relevant for the food industry in 2004. These treaties opened
the Swiss market for new entrants from the European Union and the relatively high
profit margins, in fact, encouraged Aldi (in 2005) and Lidl (in 2009) to enter.
</p>
<p>As the example shows, there may be legal impediments to entering a market, but
there may be technological ones, as well: for example, if one has to invest in an
infrastructure for the distribution of one&rsquo;s products, whose value depreciates if one
leaves the market again. The loss in value is like a barrier to entering the market,
because it defines a minimum producer surplus below which market entry is not
profitable.
</p>
<p>There may not only be barriers to enter, but also barriers to exit a market. Most
of them are related to unfinished contractual obligations, which create financial li-
abilities even after leaving the market, as seen in the sunk-costs example above.
However, there may also be technological closure costs, like shipping costs of
equipment. With positive exit costs, a firm might be forced to stay in the market
because the costs of leaving are higher than the operative loss.
</p>
<p>I will focus on the extreme case, where entry and exit costs are zero, because it
allows one to derive a very strong conclusion about the effects of competition. If the
number of firms is fixed, profits can be positive, if the price exceeds average costs.
Therefore, without market entry, it may be possible that profits are positive. Without
entry and exit costs, these profits will encourage other firms to enter the market.
This process will continue until they drive profits down to zero. Any other solution
would be incompatible with the assumption of profit maximization. However, this
is only possible if the market price is equal to the average costs of the firm, which
is the situation that Fig. 9.7 illustrates.
</p>
<p>This equilibrium is bad news for the owners of firms and good news for the
general public. It is bad news for owners, because any expectation about positive
profits will ultimately be discouraged, because market forces drive them down to
zero. This finding illustrates Adam Smith&rsquo;s quote from the beginning of this chapter.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>218 9 A Second Look at Firm Behavior Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>Zero profits does not mean that being in business is meaningless, as one can
see from the cost equation. I will focus on two factors, capital K and labor L,
for simplicity. Zero profits means that revenues p � y equal costs C.K;L; r; w/ D
r �K Cw �L. Assume the owner provides all the capital and works himself. In this
case, zero profits means that he cannot expect a compensation for his capital and
labor that exceeds the market interest rate r and the market wage w, because all the
revenues of the firm are completely used for factor payments, whose opportunity
costs are evaluated at the input prices. Therefore, the owner is indifferent between
investing in her own firm, renting out the capital at an interest rate r and working
for his own firm or working for someone else for a wage w. Zero profit, in other
words, does not mean that there are no gains from trade; it only implies that the
owners of a company do not get rents larger than the current market rates.
</p>
<p>From the point of view of the general public, zero profits are good news: they
imply that production takes place at minimum average costs, because marginal costs
intersect with average costs at the minimum of the average costs. As long as profits
are positive or negative, the average costs of production are not at their minimum.
The allocation is efficient, given the number of firms in the market, but the number
of firms (or factories) is not yet optimal. Free entry and exit implies that, in the long
run, even the number of firms adjusts such that goods are produced in the cheapest
possible way.
</p>
<p>Digression 24. The Ethics of Profit MaximizationL, B
</p>
<p>Profit is useful if it serves as a means towards an end that provides a sense both
of how to produce it and how to make good use of it. Once profit becomes the
exclusive goal, if it is produced by improper means and without the common good
as its ultimate end, it risks destroying wealth and creating poverty. (Benedict XVI
(2009), Caritas in Veritate)
</p>
<p>One of the most intensely scrutinized assumptions of mainstream economics
is profit maximization. Most people find it unethical, or even morally offen-
sive, and claim that profit maximization is a major source of the problems of
capitalist societies. The idea of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is seen
as an alternative to profit maximization, which helps firms to better align their
behavior with society&rsquo;s interests.
</p>
<p>The debate about ethical and moral standards in business is probably as
old as business itself. One of the oldest deciphered writings of significant
length in the world, the Code of Hammurabi (1700s B.C.), lays down the
rules of commerce and prescribes prices and tariffs, as well as penalties for
noncompliance.
</p>
<p>According to the 2001 Greenbook by the European Union, CSR is a &ldquo;con-
cept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their
business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a vol-
untary basis.&rdquo; In addition, since 2011 the European Union defines CSR as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.4 Firm and Market Supply 219
</p>
<p>&ldquo;the responsibility of enterprises for their impacts on society.&rdquo; This concept
goes far beyond the narrow idea of profit maximization, which was put for-
ward by Milton Friedman (1970): &ldquo;In [a free economy] there is one and only
one social responsibility of business &ndash; to use its resources and engage in ac-
tivities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of
the game.&rdquo; This quote nicely expresses the mainstream view that normative
concerns should, and can be, addressed at the level of the foundational in-
stitutions of society: the &ldquo;rules of the game.&rdquo; One has seen examples for this
approach in the preceding chapters: externalities should be internalized by the
design of property rights, contract law, taxes, regulations and so on, but not by
appealing to firms to voluntarily internalize them by non-profit-maximizing
business practices.
</p>
<p>Given these opposing views, is it possible to bridge them? For starters, one
gets a lot of support for the so-called Friedman doctrine from the model of
firm behavior under perfect competition, which was developed in this chapter.
First, note that the existence of a complete set of competitive markets implies
an ideal institutional framework which, in the language of Milton Friedman,
could be understood as the perfect rules of the game. This is expressed in
the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. Second, with free entry and exit,
competition has the tendency to drive profits to zero. However, if profits are
zero at the maximum, firms do not have much choice but to maximize them.
Paying higher wages to employees or selling at lower prices simply drives
firms out of business. The only exceptions to this rule are short-run profits,
or a situation where entry and exit are restricted, such that profits are positive
even in the long-run. However, in this case, advocates of free markets would
argue that one should first try to reduce the entry- and exit barriers to the
largest extent possible, in this case. Like it or not, under perfect competition,
there is not much room for anything but profit maximization.
</p>
<p>A lot of firms voluntarily choose ethically sound business practices. One
has to be careful to judge these practices correctly, though. Their existence
does not necessarily imply that firms incorporate other objectives than simply
profits into their business models. There are a number of cases where a more
comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the adoption of
these practices is necessary. For example, there are apparently cases in which
ethical practices are profit maximizing in a long time horizon. Paying decent
wages may motivate employees to work harder and to be loyal to the firm,
thereby increasing profits. Sustainability standards may lead to higher prices,
if consumers have a willingness to pay for sustainable production, and so on.
In fact, a lot of proponents of CSR reduce the concept to this &ldquo;enlightened
self-interest&rdquo; of the firm, the argument being that a lot of potential conflicts of
interest between the owners and managers of firms (&ldquo;shareholders&rdquo;) and other
groups in society (&ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo;) result from a too-narrow perspective of the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>220 9 A Second Look at Firm Behavior Under Perfect Competition
</p>
<p>shareholders. This view implicitly accepts the profit motive, but aligns it with
social interests by declaring them compatible. The approach could also be
called responsible profit maximization.
</p>
<p>However, this is not the end of the story. One has seen that perfect compe-
tition depends on technological prerequisites, which are not always fulfilled,
and that externalities may make an equilibrium inefficient. In situations like
these, there is room for discussion about the adequate way to address ineffi-
ciencies and problems of sustainability, as well as distributive justice on the
firm level. Here is an example: one of the major challenges of globalization
is exactly the lack of a consistent global regulatory framework &ndash; the rules of
the game &ndash; that create a perfectly level playing field, and institutions like the
WTO or OECD are too weak to fill the holes and gaps in the playground.
(Nevertheless, CSR goes beyond the problems imposed by globalization.)
Nation-states even enter into race-to-the-bottom types of international compe-
tition, where they reduce taxes and social standards to attract internationally
mobile capital. This type of competition can, in principle, be beneficial, if
it is primarily utilized as a disciplinary device for nation states to provide
public services more efficiently, but it often drives standards below the effi-
cient level. Especially large, multinational corporations can profit from these
developments and, for the foreseeable future, there is no other institutional
actor able to address the ethical issues that result from these developments
other than the corporations themselves. Again, like it or not, if they do not
care, no one will.

<p>10.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Like many businessmen of genius he learned that free competition was wasteful, monopoly
efficient. And so he simply set about achieving that efficient monopoly. (Mario Puzo
(1969), The Godfather)
</p>
<p>The model of firm behavior under perfect competition has shown how a firm&rsquo;s sup-
ply is determined, if it takes prices as given. If it produces a positive quantity, a
firm&rsquo;s optimal policy is generally determined by the condition &ldquo;marginal revenues
equal marginal costs,&rdquo; which simplifies to &ldquo;price equals marginal costs,&rdquo; because
marginal revenues and prices are identical under perfect competition. Therefore,
the firm&rsquo;s supply function is the inverse of its marginal-costs function. The fact that
it is willing to sell at marginal costs is also a prerequisite for the Pareto-efficiency
of a competitive market.
</p>
<p>However, the model has also shown that not all goods can be traded under con-
ditions of perfect competition. One prerequisite is that there are many perfect

<p>substitutes for the good a firm produces. Another prerequisite is that the firm&rsquo;s
production technology has to guarantee that the (long-run) marginal costs are non-
decreasing. For different reasons, both conditions cannot be taken for granted.
Consequently, one has to ask how markets function, if there is no perfect competi-
tion and keep one&rsquo;s focus on imperfect competition on the supply side. A similar
logic applies to imperfect competition on the demand side as is, for example, fre-
quently observed in regional labor markets, when there are only a few firms and
labor has a low mobility. Another example is public procurement with firms that
specialize in public projects. However, because imperfect competition on the sup-
ply side is the more commonly analyzed case, I will derive the implications of a
supply-side monopoly for the functioning of markets.
</p>
<p>One can start by analyzing a situation in which a firm has a monopoly for the
supply of some good. The definition of a monopoly as a market with only one
supplier of a good seems pretty obvious. However, this definition is not very opera-
tional, because it is unclear what exactly is meant by the idea that there is only one
supplier. Hence, one first has to get to grips with a more operational understanding
of what it takes for a firm to have a monopoly. Then one studies the optimal policy
for a monopolist and analyze what this implies for the functioning of markets.
</p>
<p>10.2 Conditions for the Existence of a Monopoly
</p>
<p>Assume that one wants to bake a cake and needs flour. If one compares different
retailers, one will find that each of them has different brands. In this sense, for
example Migros is a monopolist for flour sold as &ldquo;M-Budget Haushaltsmehl&rdquo; (M-
Budget flour), because Migros is the only supplier of this brand in the world. How-
ever, does this mean that Migros has a monopoly on &ldquo;M-Budget Haushaltsmehl&rdquo; in
any meaningful economic sense? This question cannot be answered without further
information. The reason is that two conditions have to be met in order to leverage
the unique characteristics of a brand onto a monopoly position.
</p>
<p>1. The customers have to be able to differentiate the product from other products
and this ability to differentiate is reflected in the fact that alternative goods are
not perceived as perfect substitutes. If consumers of flour are aware that there
are different brands, but if this fact does not influence their decision which one
to buy (because, for example, all they care for is the price of the flour), then
flour is a homogeneous good sold by different suppliers, irrespective of the dif-
ferent brands. The fact that no other firm sells &ldquo;M-Budget Haushaltsmehl&rdquo; does
not translate into the ability of Migros to raise prices above those of its com-
petitors. However, if the customers consider the different brands to stand for
non-homogeneous goods, then firms can use this willingness to differentiate be-
tween brands to charge brand-specific prices and optimal pricing becomes an
integral aspect of the optimal firm policy. Indeed, flour seems to be a homoge-
nous good to most customers and one may thus conjecture that the market for
flour is, in fact, competitive. However, it is important to note that homogeneity</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.2 Conditions for the Existence of a Monopoly 223
</p>
<p>of goods has nothing to do with the good&rsquo;s physical characteristics or the brand
name per se. It is the customers&rsquo; willingness and ability to differentiate between
goods of different suppliers that is a necessary prerequisite for a monopoly.
The willingness to differentiate can be assessed empirically by estimating the
price and cross-price elasticities of demand. Intuitively, elasticities measure
the percentage change of a variable that is caused by a one percent change in
some other variable. If demand is ordinary and very price elastic, then it reacts
strongly to price changes and there is no leeway to set prices actively. Similarly,
the cross-price elasticity describes how demand changes, if the price of another
good changes. If this elasticity is very large (in absolute terms) and the goods
are close substitutes, then there is, again, little scope for price setting. An intro-
duction to the concept of elasticities can be found in the mathematical appendix
in Chap. 14.
If the existence of a monopoly position depends on the customers&rsquo; ability and
willingness to differentiate between products, then it must be an integral element
of corporate communications and marketing to define and communicate relevant
differences to other firms&rsquo; products or to create them in the first place. From
this point of view, even an ordinary product like flour becomes interesting: in
recent years, the market has displayed increasingly differentiated products. For
example, wheat flour has been differentiated by cultivation method (organic vs.
conventional), origin (local vs. from somewhere else), etc. This differentiation
has the purpose of transforming a formerly homogeneous product into a set of
heterogeneous products for which &ndash; if the efforts are successful &ndash; differences
in the willingness to pay exist that can be exploited by the firms. Two other
examples are denim jeans and coffee.
� Denim jeans Bdo not fundamentally differ in their functionality: they protect
</p>
<p>from weather, have pockets to store and carry small items, and so on. The
physical characteristics of jeans seem to suggest that they are a fairly ho-
mogeneous product, which is sold on competitive markets. However, this
reasoning does not take into account that producers of jeans can use ad-
vertising campaigns in an effort to create a specific brand image that adds
additional &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; content to the product, from which customers can ben-
efit: jeans do not only protect from weather, but customers send a specific
social message by wearing a specific brand. The brand&rsquo;s image is transferred
onto the customer, allowing the customer to perform a specific societal role;
to belong to a specific group whose values are implicitly communicated by
the brand name. In our societies, jeans and many other products are sophis-
ticated mediums of communication and the communicative function often
dominates, or even replaces, the primary, utilitarian one (think of intention-
ally ripped jeans). This is why firms often produce cultural narratives in
which their products play an important role. If successful, there are many
differentiated products with their own differentiated markets, like the mar-
kets for Levi&rsquo;s jeans, Diesel jeans, Wrangler jeans, and so on, and the firms
have more or less extensive leeway to set prices. One can, for example, buy a</p>

<p>pair of H&amp;M jeans for $19.95 and a pair of Tom Ford Jeans for $990 (spring
2015).
</p>
<p>� For many firms in the food industry, the wine market is the reference point
for the development of marketing strategies. Because, for large parts of the
population, it is fashionable to be a &ldquo;wine connoisseur,&rdquo; a plethora of dif-
ferentiated products exist, such that producers are, to some degree, able to
exploit the customers&rsquo; ability and willingness to differentiate by charging
higher prices (which, ceteris paribus, translates into larger profits).
Currently, coffee is probably one of the more interesting products in the food
industry, because many producers &ndash; inspired by the market for wine &ndash; try
to escape the dead end of the homogeneous-good market by &ldquo;educating&rdquo;
the customer to distinguish different types of coffee. Historically, the lion&rsquo;s
share of the market sold homogenous quality and customers were very price-
sensitive, which implied a high degree of competition between suppliers. The
central elements of the &ldquo;third wave of coffee culture,&rdquo; as it is called, are ref-
erencing the origin of the coffee all the way back to the farm where it was
cropped: an accentuation of the varieties of tastes of coffee and differences
in cultivation methods, from the coffee cherry to the final beverage. This
includes the introduction of quality standards, like the &ldquo;Cup of Excellence&rdquo;
seal, and the training of customers with respect to the flavors and brewing
methods. On top of this, the emergence of the third wave as a subcultural
phenomenon in Portland, Chicago and San Francisco gives third-wave coffee
specific cultural overtones, which makes it an attractive symbol for certain
groups of customers (as in the jeans example) and which is important for the
evolution of a niche product into the (profitable) mainstream. If this project
succeeds, the &ldquo;third wave&rdquo; has the potential to change the logic of coffee
markets.
</p>
<p>2. If the demand for some product is not perfectly elastic (the market demand curve
is not flat), then the potential for a firm to create a monopoly exists. However,
a somewhat inelastic demand function is not sufficient, but merely necessary
for a monopoly. In addition, it has to be impossible for other firms to undercut
the privileged position by simply imitating the first firm&rsquo;s products. There are
different reasons for why imitation might not be a possibility.
� The producer has exclusive control over some necessary resource. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, the &ldquo;De Beers diamond monopoly&rdquo; existed because De Beers controlled
a large share of raw diamond mines.
</p>
<p>� The producer is a technology leader, such that other firms are not able to
imitate the product, because of a lack of skills. A good example is the
US-American telecommunications company AT&amp;T. It became the first long-
distance telephone network in the USA and made huge investments in re-
search and development that allowed it to acquire crucial inventions. As a
result, the company obtained near-monopoly power on long-distance phone
services.
</p>
<p>� The state regulates market entry by creating public monopolies or by patents
and trademarks. An example for high profit margins that are protected by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3 Profit Maximization in Monopolistic Markets 225
</p>
<p>patents and trademarks was the Nespresso capsule system (most patents
have expired by now). A slightly awkward example for a public monopoly
was the German monopoly for safety matches (Z&uuml;ndwarenmonopol) from
1930, which granted exclusive rights to distribute safety matches within
the borders of the German Empire to a monopolist (Deutsche Z&uuml;ndwaren-
Monopolgesellschaft). It ended in 1983. Historically, most countries had
public monopolies in the post and telecommunications industries, as well
as for rail transportation. A lot of these industries were, at least partially,
privatized and opened up for competition in the 1980ies and 1990ies.
</p>
<p>� One has already seen that competitive markets cannot function, if either or
both marginal and average costs are decreasing. In industries with such tech-
nologies, firms with larger market shares have an advantage, because they
can produce at lower marginal and average costs and, hence, can sell at lower
prices compared to their smaller competitors. Therefore, a large market share
protects firms to some extend against competition. I have already discussed
a special case of such a technology in Chapter 6, where I argued that club
goods are sometimes called natural monopolies, because they imply decreas-
ing average costs by increasing the number of users.
</p>
<p>� Some products are characterized by the fact that the utility and, therefore, the
customers&rsquo; willingness to pay is increasing with the number of customers.
This phenomenon is called a positive &ldquo;network externality.&rdquo; Examples in-
clude telephones, word processing software and social media like Facebook
and Twitter. Positive network externalities benefit firms with large market
shares. Market share protects, to some degree, against market entries and
competition, because a competitor with a smaller market share offers a ce-
teris paribus less attractive product.
</p>
<p>If one or more of the above conditions holds, then the customers&rsquo; willingness to
differentiate translates into a (possibly temporary) monopoly position. The next
subchapter analyzes how firms can make use of such a position.
</p>
<p>10.3 Profit Maximization in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>The problem of a monopolistic firm is quite complex. As the previous subchap-
ter explained, it has to decide about brand management and product development,
needs to develop pricing strategies and has to take into account the political en-
vironment to protect and further its interests. In the following subchapter, I will
reduce this complexity by focusing on the pricing aspect. Thus, the following anal-
ysis will assume that a firm has a monopoly in an already existing market with an
established product. To understand optimal pricing policies, different cases have to
be distinguished:
</p>
<p>� The firm is not able to discriminate prices between customers; each customer
buys at the same price. This is the standard model of monopoly theory. It will
allow one to understand the important elements of an optimal pricing strategy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>226 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>better. However, it is not quite realistic, because firms will usually try to dif-
ferentiate prices between customers. Hence, the standard model alone cannot
give one an appropriate picture of monopolistic behavior. The fact that price dis-
crimination is an important tool of a firm&rsquo;s policy will become clear during the
analysis.
</p>
<p>� The firm is able to discriminate prices.
&ndash; Perfect (first degree) price discrimination is possible.✍ This is a theoretical
</p>
<p>benchmark, where the firm is able to set individualistic prices for each cus-
tomer and can, in addition, discriminate by the quantity demanded. This
model helps one to understand the consequences of price discrimination by
bringing it to its extreme. It is, however, not particularly realistic, because
it assumes that firms have all the relevant information about their customers
and that a legal environment exists that allows them to use this information
to charge different customers different prices. The availability of &ldquo;big data&rdquo;
and the development of sophisticated algorithms that analyze the behavior of
individuals on the internet may, however, allow them to move closer in the
direction of perfect price discrimination in the future.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Price discrimination✍ according to the quantity, quality or time demanded (sec-
ond degree price discrimination). A firm often knows that there are different
&ldquo;types&rdquo; of customers, who differ in their willingness to pay. From its market
research, it may also know the different demand functions of these types.
However, it does not know the willingness to pay of a specific customer.
Therefore, the firm cannot condition the price on the customer&rsquo;s type directly,
but needs to find alternative, indirect ways to skim off the different types&rsquo;
willingnesses to pay by appropriately designing products and prices. Exam-
ples are economy- and business-class airline tickets. Flexibility regarding the
altering of the booking, leg space and service on board are important qual-
ity dimensions and airlines have an incentive to play with these variables to
optimize profits.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Price discrimination according✍ to specific customer attributes or customer
segments (third degree price discrimination). The monopolist is able to
discriminate between groups of customers, but cannot discriminate within
groups. An example is price discrimination of multinational firms between
countries.
</p>
<p>The following subchapters will discuss these four cases.
</p>
<p>10.4 The Optimal Production and Pricing Decision of a
Monopoly Without Price Discrimination
</p>
<p>The most studied case is the non-price-discriminating monopolist. Before dis-
cussing the circumstances under which it may be optimal to dispense with price
discrimination, one should analyze how such a market functions. Assume the mo-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.4 Monopoly without price discrimination 227
</p>
<p>nopolist acts as a profit maximizer and produces with a technology that leads to a
cost function C.y/.
</p>
<p>A firm&rsquo;s market-research Bdepartment estimates a market-demand function x D
X.p/ for one of the firm&rsquo;s products. This function shows the amount of the good or
service that can be sold at a given price p. In perfectly competitive markets, the per-
ceived demand function is perfectly price elastic at the market price. This implies
that the only information necessary to determine the optimal output is the existing
or expected market price. However, this is no longer the case for a monopoly, where
the firm needs to estimate the market-demand function with as much precision as
possible. The organization of the firm is hence more complex: while in perfectly
competitive markets, firms only need managerial accounting to determine marginal
and average costs, but a firm in a monopoly market also needs a market research
unit to estimate the demand function, because it is no longer a price taker.
</p>
<p>Digression 25. Measuring Willingness to Pay B
This chapter&rsquo;s analysis shows that an understanding of the likely responses of
potential buyers to price changes is of considerable importance for firms. De-
spite this fact and despite the advances in pricing research, many firms price
and develop products without an adequate knowledge of their customers&rsquo;
willingness to pay. Research has shown that only 8% to 15% of all com-
panies use pricing strategies that are based on empirical assessments of buyer
responses (Monroe and Cox, 2001), despite the fact that there is empirical ev-
idence that even minor changes in prices can have important effects on profits
(Marn et al., 2003). A lot of firms would rather use a strategy that may be
dubbed &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; pricing.
</p>
<p>Marketing research offers a large variety of different techniques for mea-
suring the willingness to pay. Broadly speaking, they fall into two different
categories: &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; and &ldquo;stated&rdquo; preference models. Revealed-preference
techniques infer a customer&rsquo;s willingness to pay from observed data. This can
be market data, data that is generated while browsing the internet or data gen-
erated in experiments. Stated-preference techniques are based on surveys that
are designed to elicit information about the willingness to pay. Examples of
these include, among others, expert or customer surveys, and a technique that
is called conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis is a statistical technique where a
product is partitioned into different attributes that together generate value for
the customer (in the case of a car, these attributes might be mobility, versa-
tility, status, etc.). Customers are then asked to rank or rate different bundles
of these attributes. The results are used for the design and pricing of future
products.
</p>
<p>The different techniques to measure one&rsquo;s willingness to pay have their
own strengths and weaknesses and it depends on the specific product and the
available budget of the market-research department which method is applied.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>228 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>At this point, one has to make a decision. One can assume that the monopolist
sets a price and passively adjusts the produced quantity, X.p/, or one can alterna-
tively assume that the monopolist decides on the quantity and demand determines
the price at which the market clears. Both approaches lead to the same result but,
since the second is somewhat simpler, it is the one that is usually applied. In or-
der to do so, however, one has to infer the so called &ldquo;inverse demand function&rdquo;
from X.p/, knowing that, for any price (p), the quantity (x) that can be sold is
given by x D X.p/. Taking the inverse function of this demand function yields
p D X�1.x/, which determines the price that clears the market for any quantity
offered by the firm. The convention from the previous chapters is to denote demand
by x and supply by y. Given that one is analyzing the problem from the position
of the monopolist who decides how much to supply, it makes sense, therefore, to
replace x by y in the inverse-demand function that one denotes as p D P.y/.
</p>
<p>If � denotes the firm&rsquo;s profit, then one can use this information to express it as
revenues minus costs:
</p>
<p>�.y/ D P.y/ � y � C.y/:
The problem faced by the firm&rsquo;s manager is to determine the quantity that maxi-
mizes profits. This quantity is implicitly defined by the necessary (&ldquo;first-order&rdquo;)
condition � 0.y/ D 0. (Assume in the rest of the book that this condition charac-
terizes the global profit maximum. This is guaranteed, for example, if the second
derivative of the profit function is globally negative, has a positive slope at y D 0
and has a negative slope for y ! 1.) This yields:
</p>
<p>P 0.y/ � y C P.y/ � 1 � C 0.y/ D 0:
</p>
<p>This condition has a straightforward economic interpretation: the first two terms
represent the marginal revenues of an additional unit of the good, which can be
decomposed into a price effect (first term) and a quantity effect (second term). The
quantity effect is known from perfectly competitive markets. It measures by how
much revenues increase, if an additional (marginal) unit is sold and the price stays
constant. For infinitesimal changes, it is equal to the good&rsquo;s price. The price effect
is new, however, and measures the loss in revenues of the firm, if it wants to sell
another unit. To be able to sell another unit, the firm has to lower its price a bit to
gain more customers. Since price discrimination is not possible, the firm also has to
lower the price for those customers who would have paid a higher price. This &ldquo;loss&rdquo;
can be interpreted as an opportunity cost and is measured by the price effect. The
third term represents marginal costs and hence the &ldquo;marginal revenues = marginal
costs&rdquo; rule holds.
</p>
<p>The first-order conditionB can be transformed into an easy rule of thumb, which is
of great relevance in the management and pricing literature. Simple manipulations
of the first-order condition show:
</p>
<p>P 0.y/ � y C P.y/ D C 0.y/
</p>
<p>, P.y/

</p>
<p>P 0.y/ � y

<p>The transformation from the second to the third row follows from the definition
of the inverse-demand function and the fact that demand is denoted by x. The
manipulation between the third and fourth rows follows from the definition of the
price elasticity of demand: �xp .p/.
</p>
<p>One can start by making a short plausibility check: when the market-demand
function has a negative slope, the price elasticity of demand is negative. Hence, the
expression in brackets is smaller than one. Therefore, the condition can only hold if
the price exceeds marginal costs. If there are perfect substitutes for the good, then
the price elasticity converges to �1, such that the expression in brackets converges
to 1, which leads to an intuitive conclusion: to comply with the above condition
the price has to be equal to marginal costs, which is, of course, the case in perfect
competition.
</p>
<p>If the price elasticity is finite, however, then the optimal price exceeds marginal
costs. The difference between price and marginal costs is called the &ldquo;markup&rdquo; and
this rule of thumb is called &ldquo;cost-plus pricing.&rdquo; Generally, the optimal markup is
the higher, the less elastic market demand reacts to price changes. Thus, a manager
who wants to set the optimal price needs information about two things: the marginal
costs and the price elasticity of demand.
</p>
<p>To further illustrate the optimal pricing decision of a monopolist, I derive the
solution for the special case of a linear demand function p.y/ D a � b � y and
constant marginal costs MC.y/ D c. In this case, revenues are equal to R.y/ D
a � y � b � y2, with marginal revenues being MR.y/ D a � 2 � b � y. Equating
marginal revenues and marginal costs and solving for y yields the optimal solution
y� D .a � c/=.2 � b/ and a price of p� D .aC c/=2.
</p>
<p>The demand function x.p/ D a=b � .1=b/ � p has a price elasticity of demand:

</p>
<p>The fact that the optimal quantity and price are in the elastic part of the demand
function is no coincidence: if demand is inelastic, then the monopolist can increase
revenues by reducing output, because a one percent decrease in output increases the
price by more than one percent. However, in this case, the initial level of output
could not have been profit maximizing, since reducing output also reduces costs.</p>

<p>Fig. 10.1 The supply of a monopolist without price discrimination
</p>
<p>Figure 10.1 shows the graphical solution to the profit-maximization problem of
the monopolist. The optimum is given at the quantity where the marginal-revenue
and the marginal-cost curves intersect. The associated price is defined by the value
of the demand function for that quantity.
</p>
<p>The solution to the linear model looks abstract, but is, in fact, rather intuitive.
Assume for the moment that c D 0. In this case, profit maximization boils down
to revenue maximization and revenues p.y/ � y are the rectangular area under the
demand function for any output y. Hence, the monopolist maximizes the size of this
area. The optimal output is, therefore, given at y D a=.2 � b/. If costs are positive,
one has to restrict attention to the area where gains from trade are positive. .a � c/
are the maximum gains from trade of the customer with the highest willingness to
pay, in this case. Thus, what one effectively gets is a &ldquo;truncated&rdquo; demand function
Np.y/ D Na � b � y with Na D a � c. The same argument as was used in the case of
</p>
<p>zero marginal costs also applies to this truncated function.</p>

</p>
<p>Digression 26. What Factors Determine Price Elasticities?
</p>
<p>There are two factors that determine the price elasticity of demand: the
customer&rsquo;s purchasing power (when the good becomes more expensive, cus-
tomers can ceteris paribus afford less of it) and the willingness and possibility
to substitute the good with another one. This second determinant makes
the model applicable to markets with close but imperfect substitutes, e.g.
different brands of jeans. The model&rsquo;s implication for markets with close
substitutes is that markups have to be relatively moderate. The markup rule
also gives one a first clue about how firms should invest in advertising and
public relations: cost-plus pricing indicates that the markup in a market is
negatively related to the price elasticity of demand. A marketing campaign
should hence aim at making demand less elastic. In order to determine the
optimal advertising budget, the firm needs to know the marginal revenues and
marginal costs of advertising. The marginal revenues are determined by the
change of the price elasticity of demand that is induced by another unit of
advertising.
</p>
<p>The monopolist&rsquo;s optimal price policy has interesting implications for economic
policy: since the optimal price exceeds marginal costs, unexploited gains from trade
will remain. There are still customers who are willing to pay a price that exceeds
the firm&rsquo;s marginal costs, but at which the monopolist is not willing to sell. Conse-
quently, the sum of consumer and producer surplus is below its maximum and the
market is inefficient, a situation that is also called &ldquo;market failure.&rdquo; The reason for
this market failure is easy to grasp: if the monopolist wants to sell another unit of
the good, he needs to lower the price by a bit. However, because price differentia-
tion is not possible, the price needs to be lowered for all: not only for the marginal
customers, but also for those who would buy the product at higher prices. If the
firm wants to sell at marginal costs, the decrease in revenues due to the price effect
exceeds the increase due to the quantity effect; therefore, the monopolist prefers
to constrain the quantity to keep the price high. The inefficiency is given by the
triangular area DWL in Fig. 10.1. DWL stands for deadweight-loss and is a mea-
sure for the inefficiency of the allocation. Before one can discuss the implications
for economic policy one needs to have a better understanding of the causes of this
inefficiency. Hence, the next analysis is a monopolist&rsquo;s optimal pricing policy, if
price discrimination is possible.</p>

</p>
<p>10.5.1 First-Degree Price Discrimination
</p>
<p>This subchapter covers the problem of a monopolist who is able to discriminate
prices perfectly. Although this is not a very realistic assumption, as firms are usually
unable to get all the relevant information, it is a useful theoretical benchmark and
allows one to better understand the reasons for the above-mentioned inefficiency as
well as current trends in firms&rsquo; pricing strategies.
</p>
<p>Perfect price discrimination is easy to analyze. In order to be able to pursue this
strategy, the monopolist needs to know the willingness to pay of each individual
customer. If this information is available, the firm will charge individualized prices
for each customer, which equal that customer&rsquo;s willingness to pay. (It may be nec-
essary to lower the price a bit to induce customers to actually buy the product. The
remainder of this book will assume that indifferent customers behave in the interest
of the firm. This assumption is innocuous with respect to its implications and sim-
plifies the analysis.) Hence, in such a market, there is no uniform price, but a price
function that is exactly equal to the inverse-demand function.
</p>
<p>What is the minimal price at which the monopolist will supply the good? His
profit increases as long as the price of the last unit exceeds the marginal costs of
that unit. Hence, he will expand his supply up until the point where price equals
marginal costs. This brings about a surprising result: the resulting market equi-
librium is Pareto-efficient and the sum of consumer and producer surpluses are
maximized. However, contrary to the case of perfect competition, gains from trade
are not shared between the producer and the customers. Instead, the monopolist is
able to skim off all the surplus in the market (see Fig. 10.2).
</p>
<p>Digression 27. Price Discrimination in the Digital Age

<p>is necessary to charge personalized prices was considered too extensive. On
the other hand, moving in the direction of perfect price discrimination is ex-
tremely tempting for firms, because of its obvious consequences for profits.
It should therefore not come as a surprise that e-commerce sites experiment
heavily with pricing strategies that are based on the tracks people leave while
browsing the internet.
</p>
<p>A 2015 report in the hands of the President of the United States concludes
that &ldquo;the combination of differential pricing and big data raises concerns that
some customers can be made worse off, and have very little knowledge why.
[. . . ] [M]any companies already use big data for targeted marketing, and
some are experimenting with personalized pricing, though examples of per-
sonalized pricing remain fairly limited. [. . . ] [P]roviding consumers with
increased transparency into how companies use and trade their data would
promote more competition and better informed consumer choice.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Hannak et al. (2014) analyzed the search results of 300 people who visited
16 online retailers and travel agencies from the US. They found that cus-
tomers were shown different prices or different results for the same searches
on nine of these 16 sites. For example, the online-travel company Expedia dis-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>234 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>criminates prices according to the browsing history stored on the customers&rsquo;
computers. It is unclear, however, which type of browsing history triggers
high prices. Another travel-agency, Travelocity, offered hotel rooms that were
$15 a night cheaper if viewed from an iPhone or iPad. Home Depot displays
higher prices and pricier products for smartphone users than for customers
using desktops. In 2012, Wall Street Journal found that Staples discriminated
prices according to the location of the device, and Orbitz discriminated prices
between Mac and PC users, because data analysis revealed that Mac users are
willing to pay higher prices for hotels.
</p>
<p>These attempts to discriminate prices are still relatively crude, but the
availability of more information and better algorithms may soon change the
picture. Calo (2013) concludes that big data and better algorithms will enable
companies to profile customers and deliver advertisements in a much more
personalized way, also making use of the limited rationality of individuals.
For example, Apple and Microsoft have filed patents for so-called &ldquo;mood-
based advertising&rdquo; and Amazon is developing algorithms that tell them what
the customers are likely to want before they place an order. This information
is crucial for price discrimination, because it allows them to adjust prices or
tweak choices while the customer is still searching. Google, for example,
is filing a patent for an algorithm that can decide if a customer is likely to
buy something and then to display a high price, while lowering the price for
customers who have a low likelihood of buying.
</p>
<p>Shiller (2014) studies the effects of including more information into pric-
ing strategies on profits in the case of Netflix. He found that, compared to
standard second-degree price discrimination, using the full set of information
about web-browsing behavior increases variable profits by 1.39%, compared
to 0.15% if pricing strategies are based on demographics alone. This may
not sound like much but, compared to net profit margins of 2.34% in the US
online retail industry, it makes a big difference.
</p>
<p>What are the consequences of this discovery for economic policy and the regula-
tion of monopoly markets? If one compares the case of a non-price-discriminating
monopolist with that of a perfectly price-discriminating one, one can see that the
monopolist will always choose to discriminate prices, if he can. Hence, the ineffi-
ciency in the market with a non-price-discriminating monopolist is caused by the
inability to discriminate prices. There are three reasons why this instrument may be
infeasible:
</p>
<p>1. Price discrimination is illegal.L The monopolist is then forced to charge the same
price for any customer. In this case, it is the regulation of the market that causes
the inefficiency. Market failure is not a result of some inherent tendency of the
monopolist to be inefficient, but by a failed regulation of the monopoly (if the
objective of regulation is to achieve efficiency).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.5 Price Discrimination 235
</p>
<p>An example for efforts to impede price discrimination by legal action is the
&ldquo;Robinson Patman Act,&rdquo; specifically Title 15, Chapter 1 &sect;13 of the United States
Code titled &ldquo;Discrimination in price, services, or facilities&rdquo;. It is worthwhile
studying the first paragraph of the act. &ldquo;It shall be unlawful for any person
engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indi-
rectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of
like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such
discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, con-
sumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the
District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the juris-
diction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may
be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line
of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who
either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with
customers of either of them: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall pre-
vent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of
manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities
in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered: Provided,
however, That the Federal Trade Commission may, after due investigation and
hearing to all interested parties, fix and establish quantity limits, and revise the
same as it finds necessary, as to particular commodities or classes of commodi-
ties, where it finds that available purchasers in greater quantities are so few as
to render differentials on account thereof unjustly discriminatory or promotive
of monopoly in any line of commerce; and the foregoing shall then not be con-
strued to permit differentials based on differences in quantities greater than those
so fixed and established: And provided further, That nothing herein contained
shall prevent persons engaged in selling goods, wares, or merchandise in com-
merce from selecting their own customers in bona fide transactions and not in
restraint of trade: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall pre-
vent price changes from time to time where in response to changing conditions
affecting the market for or the marketability of the goods concerned, such as
but not limited to actual or imminent deterioration of perishable goods, obso-
lescence of seasonal goods, distress sales under court process, or sales in good
faith in discontinuance of business in the goods concerned.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>2. The monopolist cannot prevent the resale of his products. In this case, resale
markets evolve and so-called arbitrageurs specialize in buying and reselling the
monopolist&rsquo;s products. For example, if there are two customers and one of them
can buy at a high price only while the other can buy at a low price, it is worth-
while for both to trade at a price that is somewhere in between the two monopoly
prices. Under ideal conditions, this process continues until only a uniform price
prevails in the market.
Why should La monopolist be unable to prevent the emergence of resale mar-
kets? To answer this question one needs to take a closer look at the types
of contracts a monopolist can use because, from a legal perspective, the sale
of a product or service is a transfer of a bundle of rights that is (explicitly or</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>236 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>implicitly) specified in the underlying contract. If the monopolist can freely
choose and constrain these rights, he can prohibit the resale of his products.
He grants his customers the right of usage, but not the right of resale. The
formation of resale markets can be precluded, if such contracts are legal and en-
forceable. However, in reality, it is often the case that courts do not enforce such
contracts. They are sometimes legal in insurance markets, where insurance poli-
cies cannot be traded freely whereas, in traditional, consumption-goods markets,
such contracts are usually illegal (for example in the European Union). How-
ever, the picture is more complicated for digital products, where complicated
arrangements exist that regulate user rights. If resale were possible, then one
would have to conclude that the source of market failure is, once again, an inef-
ficient regulation of the market.
</p>
<p>3. The monopolist does not have the information that is necessary to discriminate
prices. The next chapter will cover the implications for the monopolist&rsquo;s profit
maximization in more detail.
</p>
<p>The preliminary conclusion that one can draw at this stage is somewhat surpris-
ing, because one cannot make a case against monopolies that is based on efficiency
arguments. In light of the two models that have already been covered, one has to
conclude that market inefficiencies are a result of an insufficient regulation of the
market, not of the monopoly as such. This conclusion is, however, at odds with the
intuitive feeling that most people and also most economists share, which states that
monopolists are inherently inefficient. There are two ways to align this idea with
the realizations discussed above:
</p>
<p>First, it is, indeed, possible that a monopolist, who can perfectly discriminate
prices, can lead to an efficient market outcome. Still, society might have goals that
go further than efficiency. For example, distributive justice is a goal that many so-
cieties pursue. However, since monopolies are owned by individuals, who are also
customers, customers will, in the end, receive the monopolist&rsquo;s profits. Therefore,
one cannot judge the distributive properties of monopoly markets without further
knowledge of the distribution of property shares among the population. However,
there is empirical data about asset ownership in different countries. The demand for
products and services is usually widely scattered, whereas property is concentrated
in the hands of relatively few, rich individuals such that, from a more egalitarian
point of view, a tradeoff between efficiency and distributive justice can exist. This
may explain why some inefficiency is seen as the necessary price for a more egali-
tarian society. However, then the question arises of why the problem of distributive
justice is not addressed more directly, for example by redistributive taxation, which
would be more in line with the idea of the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics.
</p>
<p>Digression 28. Pricing and Bounded Rationality
</p>
<p>Finding ways to more effectively discriminate prices is a key topic in many
industries. Strategies to discriminate go under names such as &ldquo;dynamic pric-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.5 Price Discrimination 237
</p>
<p>ing,&rdquo; &ldquo;power pricing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;yield management.&rdquo; The basic problem behind all
of these strategies is the same: how can a firm segment its customers into
groups, which differ in their willingness to pay, and charge group-specific
prices? Such strategies can actually lead to win-win situations between firms
and customers, if there are close substitutes to the offered products (customers
do not have to accept the offer, which is why they have to be better off if they
accept it) and customers economize on search costs (e.g. finding an appropri-
ate hotel for the planned trip to Vienna).
</p>
<p>A related problem has to do with irrational or boundedly rational behavior.
Based on findings from behavioral economics, some legal scholars criticize
pricing strategies that systematically exploit customers&rsquo; behavioral biases.
Research in this field is still in its infancy.
</p>
<p>Here is an example: assume a health club or gym uses a two-part tar-
iff with an upfront-payment of L and a per-visit charge of p. If p equals
marginal costs and L contributes to the financing of the club&rsquo;s fixed costs,
then the contract is efficient. There is a lot of evidence, however, that cus-
tomers overestimate the number of times that they will go to the club. This
form of irrationality can be used by the club by charging p below its marginal
costs and increasing L, which widens the gap between the surplus that the
customer expects to receive from accepting the contract and what she actu-
ally receives. The customer finds this contract more appealing, but may end
up with a negative consumer surplus.
</p>
<p>Another example is a pricing strategy that is based on the anchoring effect
discussed in Chap. 5. The rule of thumb on how to sell a good, for which
customers have an unclear willingness to pay, is to place it right next to a
similar, but much more expensive good. Williams-Sonoma added a $429
breadmaker next to their $279 model. The consequence was that sales of
the cheaper model doubled, even though practically nobody bought the $429
machine (Ariely 2008): in this case, the expensive option acted as a price
anchor.
</p>
<p>A similar effect occurred in a study on purchasing patterns for beer
(Poundstone 2011). In the first test, subjects had the choice between a reg-
ular beer for $1.80 and a premium beer for $2.50; 80% chose the premium
beer. In the next test, a smaller and cheaper ($1.60) option was added. No
one chose the cheap option, but orders for the premium beer dropped to 20%.
In the final test, the cheap option was replaced by a large, expensive ($3.40)
option. In this case, orders for the premium beer rocketed to 85%. This ex-
periment shows that customers react to the pricing brackets in which products
are displayed. Most people go for the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; option, which gives firms a lot
of leeway in manipulating choices by developing adequate contexts for their
products.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>238 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>It might also be the case that the intuitive problems many people have with mo-
nopolies are not adequately grasped by the model. It is possible that the reason
for a lack of efficiency of a monopoly is inherently dynamic, for example, because
an ironclad monopoly position decreases the incentives to innovate. Such an argu-
ment, however, suggests that a completely different model is necessary to tackle the
problem.
</p>
<p>10.5.2 Second-Degree Price Discrimination
</p>
<p>One central problem a monopolist faces when trying to discriminate prices is his
lack of information about customers. There are two ways to solve this problem:
investing in better information or using the given information to discriminate prices
with maximum possible effectiveness. This subchapter will analyze the latter strat-
egy.
</p>
<p>In order to keep the problem simple and manageable, assume that there are two
groups of customers, which can be differentiated by their willingness to pay. The
firm knows each group&rsquo;s willingness to pay and also the respective group sizes, but
cannot identify a customer as a member of one group or the other. An example
for this situation is an airline that offers a flight from Zurich to Frankfurt, which is
frequented by both business and leisure travelers. Business travelers have a higher
willingness to pay for the flight and, in particular, for altering bookings flexibly.
The airline knows the respective willingness to pay, as well as the groups&rsquo; relative
sizes, but cannot distinguish between individuals at the ticket counter (or on their
homepage for that matter).
</p>
<p>If the firm had all the relevant information, it would charge each customer ac-
cording to his or her willingness to pay, such that both groups would receive their
respective optimal offers, as in the case of first-degree price discrimination. From
the point of view of the firm, the problem with asymmetric information is that a cus-
tomer with a high willingness to pay may prefer the offer that is being provided for
customers with a low willingness to pay. Their &ldquo;own&rdquo; offer gives the customer zero
consumer surplus, whereas the offer provided for the other group not only differs in
the quantity or quality of the good, but is also sold at a different price (both lower).
Hence, buying a lower quality or quantity at a lower price might be profitable for the
customer, if the lower price compensates for the loss in quality or quantity. In that
case, all customers choose the offer that was designed for the group with the lower
willingness to pay and the other offer remains a shelf warmer. This observation
begs the question of what a firm&rsquo;s optimal reaction should be.
</p>
<p>In order to answer the question, one should give the problem a more formal struc-
ture and analyze it graphically. In the following figures, one can see the quantity
or quality of a good along the abscissa and the customers&rsquo; willingness to pay along
the ordinate. &ldquo;Quantity&rdquo; or &ldquo;quality&rdquo; can thereby be interpreted as an attribute, for
which there are differences in the willingness to pay. In the airline example, quality
can be interpreted as the flexibility to alter a booking, how much leg space there is
or the level of service provided. If the good is a printer, quantity could refer to the</p>

text, it may be hard to distinguish between the quantity and the quality of a product.
I will use the convention to talk about quantity in the following example.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 10.3, one can see the inverse demand functions pH .x/ and pL.x/ of an
individual with a high (H-type, solid line) and low (L-type, dashed line) willingness
to pay. In order to simplify matters, assume that there are as many H-types as there
are L-types and that there is only one individual of each type. The monopolist
has marginal costs of zero, such that the efficient quantities supplied are equal to
the maximum demand levels xHo and x
</p>

</p>
<p>R x

<p>0 p
L.x/dx. Her respective willingness to pay for the
</p>
<p>efficient quantity is, therefore, given by the areas P L.xLo / D A and PH .xHo / D
AC B C C .
</p>
<p>In the preceding chapters, one has implicitly assumed that a firm sets a price
per unit of the good and the customers choose how much to buy. For effective
price discrimination with asymmetric information, the firm needs to restrict the
customers&rsquo; sovereignty by offering pre-specified quantity-price bundles. For exam-
ple, fy;PH .y/g is a possible offer where the monopolist offers quantity y at the
maximum price the H -type is willing to pay. An arbitrary pair fy;P g is also called
a &ldquo;contract.&rdquo; P is the price for y units, not for one unit of the good, as it was before.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>240 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets

<p>It is immediately clear that, with perfect information and, therefore, price dis-
crimination, the monopolist will offer the efficient contracts, fxL; P L.xL/g D
fxLo ; Ag, fxH ; PH .xH /g D fxHo ; AC B C C g. (In the following analysis, assume
that a customer is willing to purchase a contract, if he is indifferent between buying
and not buying, and that he is also willing to purchase the contract designed for
him in case that he is indifferent between two contracts. This assumption simplifies
the analysis and is without relevance for the qualitative results.) The monopolist&rsquo;s
profit is then 2ACBCC , and the consumer surplus is zero, CSH .xHo ; PH .xHo // D
CSL.xLo ; P
</p>
<p>L.xLo // D 0.
However, with asymmetric information, these contracts are not enforceable. A
</p>
<p>H -type individual would prefer to buy the contract of the L-type, because it leads
to a higher consumer surplus of B . The L-type would never buy the H -contract,
because she has no willingness to pay for the additional quantity and, therefore, has
no willingness to pay the higher price.
</p>
<p>How will the firm react to this problem? In order to answer this question, one
first needs to understand whether it is possible to change the contracts in a way that
increases profits. If nobody buys the H -contract, because the H -types prefer the
L-contract, then the firm&rsquo;s profits are 2A. In order to induce the H -type to buy
&ldquo;his&rdquo; contract, the firm can decrease the price of the H -contract until the H -type
is indifferent between the two. Because his consumer surplus is B , this is achieved
when the H -contract is fxHo ; AC C g (see Fig. 10.3). Because altering the contract
in that way increases profits to 2ACC , it is always profitable. The profit is smaller
than it would be with perfect price discrimination, but larger than 2A is.
</p>
<p>Is this the profit-maximizing pair of contracts? The answer is no, because the
firm has another policy parameter that it can use to increase the effectiveness of
price discrimination, namely the quantity of the product. If it is reduced in the L-
contract, then both types&rsquo; willingness to pay for this contract decreases. Therefore,
the firm has to complement this change with a decrease in the price for this contract
in order to be able to sell it. This seems like a bad idea, because it decreases the
profit from the L-contract. The fact that a change of the contract in this direction
can increase profits can be seen once one takes into account that the H -type has a
higher marginal willingness to pay for additional quantity; he is willing to pay more
for the last unit than the L-type is. This fact has the following consequence: the
reduction of the quantity that is offered in the L-contract does not only decrease the
profit from selling to the L-type, but can also be used to increase the price for the H -
contract. The H -types&rsquo; implicit &ldquo;threat&rdquo; to choose the L-contract becomes weaker
given that fxH ; PH .xH /g D fxHo ; ACC g. The L-contract becomes less attractive
for both, but this effect is stronger for the H -type, whose willingness to pay for
additional quality is higher than the L type&rsquo;s is. Thus, this quantity reduction can
be used as an instrument for type selection. In the limit, as the L-contract&rsquo;s quantity
goes to zero at a price of zero, it becomes possible to increase the H -contract&rsquo;s price
to AC B C C again.
</p>
<p>Contracts that make the H -type indifferent between both contracts fulfill the so-
called self-selection constraint. Figure 10.4 shows the possible and necessary price
adjustments accompanying a change of the quantity of the L-contract from xLo to
xLo � dxLo .</p>

</p>
<p>The adjustment of the contract stops when the marginal increase in profits, due
to the increase in the price for the H -contract, equals the marginal loss in profits
caused by the reduction of the price for the L-contract. Graphically, this means that
the line segment between the H -type&rsquo;s and the L-type&rsquo;s demand functions have to
be of equal length as the line segment between the L-type&rsquo;s demand function and
the abscissa. This situation is depicted in Fig. 10.5.
</p>
<p>(In Fig. 10.5, both contracts offer positive amounts of the good. This finding
results from the assumption that both types have equal frequencies in the population
and the specific demand functions. If there are either very few L-types, or their
willingness to pay differs significantly from the H -type&rsquo;s, then it can be the case
that the monopolist prefers not to sell to the L-types at all.)
</p>
<p>The previous analysis has revealed some general characteristics of optimal price
discrimination with asymmetric information.
</p>
<p>� The H -type always consumes his optimal quantity, unlike the L-type. This prop-
erty is also called no distortion at the top, because it is a general property of
models with asymmetric information to not distort the allocation of the &ldquo;best&rdquo;
type.
</p>
<p>� With such contracts, the H -type always receives positive consumer surplus, if
the L-quantity is positive. The L-type always gets a surplus of zero.</p>

</p>
<p>While these characteristics of optimal contracts sound quite abstract, they are
very useful for understanding real-world pricing decisions. In the aforementioned
example of airline pricing, business travelers usually have a higher willingness to
pay for flexibility than leisure travelers do. In order to apply the model, one can
interpret x as a variable that measures the flexibility of a ticket. The results of the
model can then be interpreted in the following way: the airline should discrimi-
nate between the two groups of customers by offering economy and business class
tickets. Business class tickets offer the optimal flexibility and comfort to business
travelers, but economy tickets come with less flexibility and comfort than econ-
omy customers would like (and are willing to pay for). This reduced flexibility
and comfort of economy tickets is the reason that business travelers choose &lsquo;their&rsquo;
higher-priced tickets, because they get a larger surplus from doing so. This can
lead to strange incentives for airlines that may, for example, make economy seating
purposely uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>This logic can be applied to many other markets, for example ones in which
customers can be grouped as &ldquo;professional&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo; users (software, computer
hardware, . . . ). The strategy to play around with product quantity and quality in a
way that makes sure that market segments are kept separate, in order to prevent
demand spillover from high-priced segments to low-priced segments, is also called</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.5 Price Discrimination 243
</p>
<p>price fencing. Price fences are very important for effective market segmentation
and, therefore, for profit maximization. As in the above example, they are designed
such that customers who can afford and are willing to pay higher prices are not
tempted by the lower-priced versions.
</p>
<p>Looking at the pricing of the MacBook Pro with Retina display (US prices,
2013), there were three versions of the computer, priced $1,299, $1,499 and $1,799.
The only difference between the $1,299 and $1,499 versions was the RAM and flash
capacity. Assume that one prefers the cheapest version, but would like to have more
flash capacity. One option would be to customize the cheapest version by increas-
ing the flash capacity. However, this option was not available. The only way to get
more flash capacity was to buy the $1,499.00 version. The only option offered was
to increase RAM from 4 GB to 8 GB for $100 more. It could be argued that the
lack of such an option resulted from a technical problem, but it is not because the
option to upgrade flash capacity was offered for the non-Retina version of the Mac-
Book Pro. Hence, constraining options for customers must be seen as a purposeful
strategy to &ldquo;fence them in.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Sometimes, firms even have an incentive to incur costs to make products worse.
Manufacturers of printers, for example, standardly equip their printers with soft-
and hardware that is designed for fast printing speed and then equip a series of
these printers with (costly) additional hard- and software to slow them down and
sell them at a lower price. Thus, if a private user wonders at times why firms
do not offer the perfect products for her needs, this may be the answer: from the
point of view of a firm, the marginal costs of production are not the only ones it
has to take into consideration. Additionally, there are opportunity costs that exist
because customers from a different group may buy a version of the product that is
not designed for them. These opportunity costs are relevant for the firm, but not for
society, which is why there are externalities in the resulting equilibrium.
</p>
<p>A related strategy ✍for profit maximizing firms, which should briefly be men-
tioned, is called bundling. The underlying problem for a firm is to decide on the
number of characteristics or features of a product. A car manufacturer can, for
example, include features like driver alert, adaptive cruise control or other safety
features in the standard package, or sell them separately. A flower shop can sell
bouquets or separate flowers, a computer can come with word processor, spread-
sheet and presentation program, or the soft- and hardware can be sold separately,
and so on.
</p>
<p>If one thinks of different features of a complex product as separate, simpler
products, then the problem of bundling is to determine which products should be
included in a bundle and which ones should be sold separately. There are several
rationales for bundling. There could, for example, be complementarities between
products, which is why shoes are usually sold as pairs. Alternatively, bundling
might economize on costs, because bundles are more efficient to produce or dis-
tribute.
</p>
<p>A subtler reason for bundling results from the fact that it allows the producer to
skim off the willingness to pay in situations where it would otherwise be impossible</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>244 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>Table 10.1 An example for
product bundling
</p>

</p>
<p>N 120 100 220
</p>
<p>A 100 120 220
</p>
<p>to do so. This is why it makes sense to discuss bundling in the context of asymmetric
information and second-degree price discrimination.
</p>
<p>Here is an example. Assume there are two types of customers in the market, who
are interested in two different products: word-processing (WP ) and spreadsheet
(SS) software. One type of customer has a high willingness to pay for WP and
a low willingness to pay for SS (say, a novelist, N ), and the other has a high
willingness to pay for SS and a low willingness to pay for WP (an accountant, A).
Table 10.1 gives an example for the two types of customers&rsquo; willingness to pay for
the two different products. Type N is willing to pay up to CHF 120 for WP and
CHF 100 for SS , and type A is willing to pay up to CHF 100 for WP and CHF 120
for SS . Hence, the total willingness to pay for both products is CHF 220 for both
types.
</p>
<p>Assume that the firm that sells the software knows that these two types of cus-
tomers exist (one of each type), but that it cannot verify the identity of a customer
when she buys the software. Assume further that the marginal costs of an addi-
tional software license are zero. Now, consider two pricing strategies for the firm:
the unbundled and bundled selling of the two products.
</p>
<p>What happens if the firm sells both products separately? I start with WP and
denote its price by pWP . If pWP � 100, the firm can sell two licenses. If pWP 2
.100; 120&#141;, it can sell one license and, for all prices pWP &gt; 120, the number of
licenses sold drops to zero. Hence, the profit-maximizing price is pWP D 100,
yielding a profit of � D 200. The same calculation applies for SS . Therefore, total
firm profits with unbundled selling are � D 400.
</p>
<p>What happens if the firm decides to bundle the products? Denote the price of
a bundle by pB . Demand for each bundle is two, if pB � 220, and drops to zero
for higher prices. Hence, the profit-maximizing price for each bundle is equal to
pB D 220, yielding profits of � D 440.
</p>
<p>Compared to the unbundled selling, bundling increases profits by 40 D 440 �
400. What has happened? The underlying rationale is that differences in the will-
ingness to pay &ldquo;average out&rdquo; by bundling. If the licenses are sold separately, the
minimum willingness to pay becomes decisive in the example. This effect cancels
out, if the two products are bundled and sold as a &ldquo;package.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>This result is robust and especially relevant for digital products that are produced
at almost zero marginal costs: bundling large numbers of unrelated goods makes it
easier to predict the customers&rsquo; valuations for a bundle than their valuation for an
individual good does when it is sold separately. This &ldquo;predictive value of bundling&rdquo;
makes it possible to increase sales and profits. Examples are cable television, an in-
ternet site&rsquo;s content (e.g. the New York Times), or copyrighted music (for example
Spotify).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.5 Price Discrimination 245
</p>
<p>To conclude Bthis subchapter, it is important to note that the above findings also
have implications for the optimal organization of firms. As seen, there are differ-
ent contracts for different groups of customers. The two dimensions of the optimal
contracts, which are price and &ndash; depending on the specific interpretation &ndash; quan-
tity or quality, are not independent from each other, but can only be understood in
combination. Hence, to take these important interdependencies into account, the
responsibility for the different customer groups should not be given to different,
independent product managers whose responsibility is to maximize profits for their
departments (profit centers). This system ignores the fact that modifications of the
contracts cause externalities in the other departments thereby leads to a situation
where each manager maximizes the profits of his profit center, but not the total firm
profits.
</p>
<p>10.5.3 Third-Degree Price Discrimination
</p>
<p>The last case is third-degree price discrimination. This variant is characterized
by the firm&rsquo;s ability to discriminate between different segments of customers, but
not within each segment. A prominent example is price discrimination between
national markets, which is often practiced by internationally operating firms. Espe-
cially the pharmaceutical industry repeatedly makes it into the headlines for selling
the same active ingredients at higher prices in Switzerland than in, for example,
the European Union. However, prices for ordinary consumption goods are also dis-
criminated in this way and Swiss customers quite often pay more for a good than
others do. Apple Inc., for example, makes extensive use of international price dis-
crimination. The average price for a song in the iTunes store was $1.29 in the US
and CHF 2.30 in Switzerland in 2011 (the average exchange rate in 2011 was about
US$ 1.10 per 1 CHF). However, there are many other forms of third-degree price
discrimination, for example according to age group or status (student or senior dis-
counts, discounts for military members in the US) or according to gender (&ldquo;Ladies&rsquo;
night&rdquo; in nightclubs or at the dry cleaners, which typically charge higher prices for
women&rsquo;s clothes).
</p>
<p>Assume that a firm produces a given product at a given production facility (say
in China) and sells it to two countries, Switzerland (country 1) and France (country
2). The respective quantities are y1 and y2, and the production and logistics costs
depend on the total quantity produced, C.y1 C y2/. The market-research depart-
ment estimates the demand functions in the two countries as P 1.y1/ and P 2.y2/.
Consequently, total profits are given by:
</p>
<p>�.y1; y2/ D P 1.y1/ � y1 C P 2.y2/ � y2 � C.y1 C y2/:
</p>
<p>From the manager&rsquo;s point of view, the problem is to choose the quantities supplied
to the different markets in order to maximize profits. The optimal decision is char-</p>

</p>
<p>If one looks at the two conditions in isolation, the result is not very surprising: as in
the model without price discrimination, the firm chooses the quantity that equalizes
marginal revenues with marginal costs for each market. Only if one takes into
account the fact that marginal costs are identical irrespective of the market where
the products are sold (production takes place in the same factory) can one learn
something new. Then one can establish the following relationship between the two
markets:
</p>
<p>@P 1.y1/
</p>
<p>@y1
� y1 C P 1.y1/ D @P
</p>
<p>2.y2/
</p>

� y2 C P 2.y2/:
</p>
<p>Thus far, the above condition only states that marginal revenues are equal in both
markets. However, rewriting the equation to transform it into the rule of thumb that
was developed before, one gets:

<p>To further illustrate this condition, assume that demand in both markets is linear,

</p>
<p>This result gives an important hint as to why prices in Switzerland are generally
higher than abroad. The willingness to pay (as reflected by a low price elasticity) is
higher in Switzerland than elsewhere, which implies that firms sell their products at
higher prices. One can use this theoretical result to test the theory empirically. All
one needs to do is to estimate the price elasticities in different markets and compare
them with prices. If the hypothesis of the model cannot be rejected, then one has a
valid explanation for an important empirical phenomenon.
</p>
<p>Without going into the analytical details, it is time to contemplate the conse-
quences of a regulation that forbids price discrimination between markets. Such a
regulation might, for example, prevent price discrimination directly, or it might al-
low the emergence of resale markets that make profit out of price arbitrage between
markets. Such a &ldquo;single-price philosophy&rdquo; can, for example, be found in the Euro-
pean Union with its &ldquo;Single European Market,&rdquo; which is enforced by the European
Commission.
</p>
<p>Taking the theoretical results from above as a point of departure, the monopolist,
who is no longer in a position to discriminate prices, needs to determine the new,
aggregate demand function for the joint market. This new demand function results
from adding up the individual market demand functions, X.p/ D x1.p/ C x2.p/,
and it follows that the new inverse demand function is P.x/ D X�1.x/. The result-
ing problem is equivalent to the problem of a monopolist who cannot discriminate
prices. Hence, even without a formal analysis of the situation, one can determine
the differences between the new and the old situation. There are three different
constellations possible:
</p>
<p>1. The demand structure is similar in both countries and markets are of approxi-
mately the same size. The monopolist will sell to customers in both markets and
the new price will be in between the prices that would be charged with price
discrimination. The redistributive consequences between the customers in both
markets are easy to determine: customers in the previously high-price market
profit, because they can buy at lower prices, and more customers buy, while
those in the previously low-price market lose, because they are paying higher
prices and fewer customers buy.
</p>
<p>2. The country with less elastic demand is relatively large or the price difference
between countries is large, or both. In this case, it can happen that the monop-
olist will not serve the smaller market anymore. The reason is that, in order to
sell to the smaller market, he must lower the price in the larger market to an ex-
tent that makes it rational to not serve the more elastic, or smaller market, at all.
The effect is that nothing changes for the large country, but the situation in the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>248 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>smaller market deteriorates, because its customers are excluded from the con-
sumption of the product. Therefore, prohibiting price discrimination in different
markets may lead to inefficiency and exclude customers from consumption.
</p>
<p>3. The country with higher prices is relatively small or the price difference is rela-
tively small, or both. In this case, the price in the more expensive country might
decrease almost to the level of the other country. There is no change for the for-
merly low-price country, whereas customers in the formerly high-price country
benefit.
</p>
<p>This qualitative analysis shows that no clear prediction about the consequences of
market integration can be made without further information about the relative size
of the markets and the relative willingness to pay in each market. Only if this kind
of information is available, is it possible to make a reliable prognosis about the
effects of such a policy change.
</p>
<p>Digression 29. Parallel Imports in the European Union (EU)L
Firms that sell in different markets have an incentive to discriminate prices
according to the market-specific elasticities of demand. However, the cre-
ation of a common market within the EU has made it possible for parallel
imports to move freely across the EU. Parallel imports are sales by autho-
rized or unauthorized distributors to another country without the permission
of the initial property owner.
</p>
<p>Parallel importers use price differences between markets to make a profit
out of price arbitrage. This puts pressure on high prices and, thereby, cre-
ates a tendency towards uniform prices within a common market. The only
industry-specific exemption from the general competition principles is the
automotive industry. The purpose of the so-called &ldquo;block exemptions&rdquo; is to
restrict competition between car dealers. Nevertheless, even with these spe-
cial agreements, EU rules require the car dealers to sell their products to any
EU citizen regardless of where they live.
</p>
<p>This regulation is, of course, a thorn in the side of car manufacturers, who
try to find ways to limit competition due to parallel imports. The European
Commission fined Volkswagen an amount of �102 million (later reduced
to �90 million) for preventing Austrian and German customers from buy-
ing cars in Italy. It also fined PSA Peugeot Citroen �49.5 million. Peugeot
Netherlands tried, for example, to incentivize its franchise dealers to restrict
sales to other countries by withholding bonus payments and limiting the sup-
ply of Peugeot cars.</p>

<p>10.6 Monopolistic Competition 249
</p>
<p>10.6 Monopolistic Competition
</p>
<p>I have argued that the models of monopolistic behavior apply to situations where a
firm faces a demand function that is not perfectly elastic. This situation allows the
firm to charge prices that are above marginal costs. The associated producer surplus
is higher than in a situation of perfect competition. This has two consequences.
</p>
<p>First, if production involves fixed costs, the firm can stay profitable in situations
where firms in competitive markets would have to leave the market, as long as
prices are above average costs. Such a situation is illustrated in Fig. 10.6, where it
is assumed that the monopolist can not discriminate prices.
</p>
<p>In this figure, average costs are above marginal costs, but below the price of a
non-price-discriminating monopolist. This leads to a situation where a competitive
firm makes a loss equal to area A, whereas a monopolist makes a profit that is equal
to area B .
</p>
<p>Second, positive profits in a monopolistic market, as in Fig. 10.6, make it attrac-
tive for other firms to develop similar products. Even if these firms are legally or
otherwise prevented from simply imitating the profitable product, they can try to
develop and sell similar ones. Such a situation is called monopolistic competition
and there are several examples for such industries:

<p>� Cars of a given type from different manufacturers (like SUVs from Audi, Mer-
cedes, BMW, Volkswagen, etc.).
</p>
<p>� Books or music that are variations of the same topic (romantic novels or text-
books in economics) or style (Jazz, Pop, Classical Music).
</p>
<p>� Smartphones, tablets or notebooks from different manufacturers.
� Pubs and restaurants in a city.
</p>
<p>The above list illustrates that monopolistic competition is a very prominent mar-
ket structure, especially in an economy where brands are important for customers
(which is the same as saying that they are willing to pay for a specific brand). This
is why it makes sense to understand the functioning of this type of a market. The
different varieties of similar goods are called differentiated products.
</p>
<p>The main question is about the number of similar products that exist in such an
industry. When one compares the total number of different SUVs with the total
number of different romantic novels, one sees that there are huge differences. Are
there any patterns that allow one to explain why some industries produce a relatively
small number of variants, whereas others produce far more?
</p>
<p>The basic idea for answering this question is to blend the analysis of a single
monopoly with the idea of market entry: assume there is free market entry and exit
and that a monopolist makes a profit with a product, say an SUV from a given man-
ufacturer A. Profits exist, if the price exceeds the average costs, pA &gt; ACA.yA/.
</p>
<p>These profits encourage another firm, B , to enter the market and to sell a similar
product. The availability of this additional product increases the choice of the cus-
tomers. They still consider the products to be different, but the existence of another
model in the SUV market makes the first one less exclusive and manufacturers A
and B have to somehow share the market. The effect is that the demand for SUV A
is likely to shift leftward and to become more price elastic, which reduces profits.
With free entry and exit, additional firms will enter the market as long as profits are
still positive.
</p>
<p>By the same token, if the number of different products is so large that the firms
(for example i ) are making losses, pi &lt; AC i .yi /, some of them will have to leave
the market. The effect is that the number of products from which the customers can
choose decreases. This effect likely shifts the demand rightward and makes it less
price elastic.
</p>
<p>The long-run equilibrium must, therefore, be a situation where the prices of the
products equal average costs, pi D AC i .yi /, because at this point firms make zero
profits. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 10.7.
</p>
<p>This is the situation where no further competitor is willing to sell another similar
product and no existing competitor is willing to leave the market. The figure reveals
two properties of the long-run equilibrium in such a market.
</p>
<p>First, if firms can develop similar products, there is no escape from the zero-profit
equilibrium in the long run. As in the case of perfect competition, competitors will
react to positive profits by entering the market with differentiated products.</p>

</p>
<p>Second, even though long-run profits are zero, the resulting allocation is not
Pareto-efficient. The single firm is still facing a downward-sloping demand function
for its product, so prices in this industry will be above marginal costs.
</p>
<p>In addition, one can say something about the number of differentiated products
that can survive in such an industry. Figure 10.6 shows a situation where the mo-
nopolist has profits �M . Profits depend on the relationship between the demand and
the average-cost curve. The bigger the difference is, the higher the profits are. Now,
assume that this firm is the first one to sell a new type of product (the first SUV),
such that Fig. 10.6 refers to a situation where no other firm has entered the market
with a similar product.
</p>
<p>Profits depend on fixed costs. An increase in fixed costs shifts the average-cost
curve upwards, which implies that profits decline. In the extreme case, profits are
equal to zero without any competition from differentiated products. If a second
firm enters the market with a similar product, any leftward shift of the demand
function that is caused by market entry implies losses for the firm. If profits had
been positive but relatively small, the shift in the demand function reduces them,
but not necessarily to zero, which would imply that there is room for a second firm
selling a similar product. The pattern that becomes visible here is a general one:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>252 10 Firm Behavior in Monopolistic Markets
</p>
<p>the more fixed-cost-intensive the production of the product is, the fewer firms can
succeed in the market; the number of differentiated products is inversely related to
the fixed costs of production.
</p>
<p>The above argument was pretty loose, so it makes sense to develop it formally.
In order to do so, assume that there are n differentiated products in a market and
that demand for a single product is given by the demand function yi D Y.1=n �
b.pi � Np//, where Np D
</p>
<p>Pn
jD1 p
</p>
<p>j =n is the average price level and Y D
Pn
</p>
<p>jD1 y
j
</p>
<p>is the total output in the industry. Here, b represents the responsiveness of a firm&rsquo;s
output to its price. The demand function implies that the n different firms share
the market equally, if they charge identical prices: pi D Np implies yi D Y=n.
When we solve the model we will see that this function implies that individual and
market demand are not absolutely fixed so that we have a degree of freedom in
determining the equilibrium. Assume further that all firms produce with identical
cost functions C.yi / D c �yi CFC and maximize profits. These assumptions may
not be particularly realistic, but they simplify the analysis considerably without
changing the qualitative insights.
</p>
<p>From the point of view of a single firm, the inverse demand function is given as
P.yi / D 1=.b � n/C Np � yi=.b � Y /, which leads to profits as a function of output:
</p>
<p>�.yi / D P.yi / � yi � c � yi � FC D
�
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>b � n C Np �
yi
</p>
<p>b � Y
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>� yi � c � yi � FC:
</p>
<p>The profit-maximizing output of firm i is, again, characterized by the first-order
condition of the profit function. (In general, Y and Np are functions of yi . As-
sume that the firm neglects this effect.) If one does the math, one ends up with the
following price and output of product variant i :
</p>
<p>yi� D bY .1=.b � n/C Np � c/
2
</p>
<p>; pi� D 1=.b � n/C Np C c
2
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>The solution has intuitive economic properties: the profit-maximizing output and
price of variant i is decreasing as the number of variants n increases. This property
illustrates the effect of competition on the market for product variant i : the larger
the number of similar products, the fewer the number of products of a given variant
that can be sold and the lower the price level for this variant.
</p>
<p>What is even more interesting is if one can say something about the number of
differentiated products that can be supplied in this market. In order to gain insight
into this question, assume that all firms charge equal prices in equilibrium, pi� D
Np D p�. If one uses this assumption, one can solve for the equilibrium price level
</p>
<p>in this industry for a given number of differentiated products n:
</p>
<p>p� D 1=.b � n/C p
� C c
</p>
<p>2
, p� D 1
</p>
<p>b � n C c:
</p>
<p>This finding nicely illustrates that the markup rule still applies: the firm is able to
sell the variant above marginal costs c, but the markup is the lower, the higher the
competitive pressure is that results from the number of similar products n.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.6 Monopolistic Competition 253
</p>
<p>If we use the information that all prices in the industry are the same, we get back
to the above-mentioned property that individual and market demand are not fixed
in absolute terms such that we have a degree of freedom that we can use to fix one
of these variables and solve the rest of the model relative to it. We use yi� D 1 as
normalization because it is easy to solve, but any other convention would work as
well:
</p>
<p>yi� D bY .1=.b � n/C 1=.b � n/C c � c/
2
</p>
<p>D Y
n
</p>
<p>D 1:
</p>
<p>Hence, the total supply of variant i is equal to 1, and industry output is, therefore,
equal to n, the number of firms in the industry. One last step is missing to deter-
mine how many differentiated products exist in the long run. Given the equilibrium
outputs and prices, profits of an arbitrary firm i are equal to
</p>
<p>� i� D
�
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>b � n C c
�
</p>
<p>� 1 � c � 1 � FC:
</p>
<p>This equation, again, shows the effects of competition: equilibrium profits are de-
creasing with an increasing number of differentiated products.
</p>
<p>One knows that free entry and exit into this industry drive profits down to zero,
</p>
<p>�
1
</p>
<p>b � n C c
�
</p>
<p>� 1 � c � 1 � FC D 0:
</p>
<p>This information can be used to finally determine the long-run number of differen-
tiated products:
</p>
<p>�
1
</p>
<p>b � n C c
�
</p>
<p>� 1 � c � 1 � FC D 0 , n D 1
b � FC :
</p>
<p>This result confirms the intuitive conclusion that I have discussed before: there is
a negative relationship between the fixed costs of an industry and the number of
differentiated products that exist in a long-run equilibrium. This result sheds light
on the question of why there are fewer SUVs than romantic novels on the market:
product categories differ with respect to fixed costs. Writing a beach novel is far
less expensive than developing a new car. (Both, the costs of writing the novel and
the development costs, are part of the technological fixed costs, because they occur
independently of the number of copies or cars sold.)
</p>
<p>BThe result also contains an important message for managers in an industry with
differentiated products, because profits for a given number of competitors and the
long-run number of competitors allows estimations as to whether market entry is
still profitable and how many variants a product can survive in the long run.</p>

<p>11.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>I am willing to take life as a game of chess in which the first rules are not open to discussion.
No one asks why the knight is allowed his eccentric hop, why the castle may only go straight
and the bishop obliquely. These things are to be accepted, and with these rules the game
must be played: it is foolish to complain of them. (W. Somerset Maugham (1949))
</p>
<p>Game theory addresses the analysis of strategic interdependencies between the ac-
tions of different decision makers. Many of the early contributions to game theory
dealt with the analysis of parlor games. Two of the most important works on game
theory of the early 20th century were Ernst Zermelo&rsquo;s &ldquo;&Uuml;ber eine Anwendung der
Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels&rdquo; (On an Application of Set Theory
to the Theory of the Game of Chess, 1913) and John von Neumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Zur Theorie
der Gesellschaftsspiele&rdquo; (On the Theory of Parlor Games, 1928). The term game
obtained a totally different meaning, referring to all kinds of situations where indi-
viduals interact. Game theory is, by now, an indispensable tool in many scientific
disciplines, apart from economics, mostly in political science and finance, but also
in biology, law and philosophy. The goals of game theory are various and reach
from explaining societal phenomena, to predicting individual decision making, to
providing consultation.

<p>256 11 Principles of Game Theory
</p>
<p>Many economistsB would even state that it was the development of game the-
ory that made economics a scientific discipline of its own. Traditional economic
reasoning has been based on more or less informal theories or on models, which
were frequently adapted from physics. The analysis of imperfect competition on
markets, bargaining, conflicts between individuals and groups, and competition be-
tween states are only some of the fields in which techniques from game theory are
successfully applied. In the course of the appearance of game theory, economists
developed a subfield called &ldquo;market design.&rdquo; This discipline has strong similarities
to engineering, because it applies scientific theories to design market mechanisms
that help to facilitate structured transactions and improve efficiency. Market design
became known to a wider audience because of the auctioning of UMTS telecom-
munications licenses, for which many countries used auction formats that had been
developed by economists using methods from game theory. Another example for
market design is the development of algorithms facilitating organ donations and
labor markets. For instance, in some countries, they are used to facilitate kidney
exchanges or to allocate doctors to hospitals. Game theory is also the backbone of
behavioral economics, a field of research in which economists study the structure
of cooperative behavior and the limitations of rational decision making.
</p>
<p>A classic field of study within economics, in which game theory is often used, is
the analysis of oligopoly markets. The central characteristic of those markets is that
firms have some control over prices, similar to a monopolist, but the existence of
competitors restricts this control and makes the optimal price and quantity decision
dependent on each firm&rsquo;s expectations about the behavior of the competitors and,
hence, the decisions are interdependent. In order to study these interdependencies
and, thus, be able to make predictions about these market types (as well as many
other societal phenomena), I give a short introduction to game theory in this chapter.
</p>
<p>11.2 What Is a Game?
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;game&rdquo; describes a situation of strategic interdependence. The involved decision
makers, for example individuals and firms, are called &ldquo;players.&rdquo; Strategic interde-
pendence in the game-theoretic sense is given, if the actions of players potentially
influence one another. Here is a simple example that illustrates the problem. As-
sume there were no rules about on which side of the road one should drive. Two
cars, moving in opposite directions, meet. The driver of each car wants to go on
driving without an accident. If both stay on their right or left lane, then no harm is
done. However, if one goes left and the other one goes right, then the result is an ac-
cident. Probably, everybody knows similar situations from crowded market places
and sidewalks, where people go in opposite directions and try to avoid bumping into
each other. A good way to navigate through the crowds depends on the actions of
all the others and, hence, this is a situation of strategic interdependence.
</p>
<p>Another illustrative example is the &ldquo;rock-paper-scissors&rdquo; (RPS) game. Two play-
ers face each other and have to choose one of the following gestures: &lsquo;rock&rsquo;, &lsquo;paper&rsquo;
or &lsquo;scissors.&rsquo; &lsquo;Rock&rsquo; beats &lsquo;scissors&rsquo;, &lsquo;scissors&rsquo; beats &lsquo;paper&rsquo;, and &lsquo;paper&rsquo; beats</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.3 Elements of Game Theory 257
</p>
<p>&lsquo;rock&rsquo;. If both players choose the same gesture, then nobody wins and the game
ends in a draw. If a player wants to win the game, then his optimal gesture de-
pends on the gesture of his opponent. If the other player chooses &lsquo;rock&rsquo;, then one
optimally chooses &lsquo;paper&rsquo;; if the other chooses &lsquo;scissors,&rsquo; then &lsquo;rock&rsquo; would be the
optimal gesture.
</p>
<p>11.3 Elements of Game Theory
</p>
<p>In order to analyze a situation of strategic interdependence using game theory, it
is necessary to (1) systematically describe a game, (2) to form hypotheses about
players&rsquo; behavior and (3) to apply a so-called solution concept.
</p>
<p>The description of a game � usually starts with listing the involved decision
makers, the players. The set N D f1; 2; : : : ; ng denotes all n � 1 players involved
in a game. In the example of RPS, this set is N RPS D f1; 2g, i.e. the set listing
players 1 and 2.
</p>
<p>Next, one has to specify what the players can do. An action of a player is called
a strategy. The set of all, mi , possible strategies of a player, i 2 N , is denoted
by Si D
</p>
<p>˚
</p>
<p>s1i ; s
2
i ; : : : ; s
</p>
<p>mi
i
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>, and sji , j 2 f1; 2; : : : ; mig denotes one specific strategy
from this set. In the example of RPS, both players have the same strategy sets:
SRPS1 D SRPS2 D frock; paper; scissorsg.
</p>
<p>A strategy profile assigns a strategy to each player and is denoted by s 2 S D
S1 �S2 � � � � �Sn (the mathematical operator &lsquo;�&rsquo; refers to the Cartesian product of
the sets Si , i D 1; 2; : : : ; n). S is the set of all possible strategy profiles. In RPS,
it is equal to the set of all combinations of the form .s1 2 SRPS1 ; s2 2 SRPS2 /, which
is the set with the elements .scissors; scissors/, .rock; scissors/, .paper; scissors/,
.scissors; rock/, .rock; rock/, .paper; rock/, .scissors; paper/, .rock; paper/, and
.paper; paper/.
</p>
<p>Each strategy profile is a possible course of the game. Starting from the strategy
profiles s 2 S , one can determine the possible outcomes of a game induced by
the different profiles. The outcome function, f W S ! E, assigns to each strategy
profile s 2 S an outcome e, from the set of potential outcomes E. In the example of
RPS, the set of possible outcomes is ERPS D fplayer 1 wins; player 2 wins; drawg.
The function f .s/ determines an outcome e 2 E for every s 2 S . For example if, in
RPS, the strategy profile is s D .scissors; rock/, then the function f .s/ determines
the outcome &lsquo;e D player 2 wins.&rsquo; If s D .paper; paper/, then the outcome is &lsquo;e D
draw.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Finally, in order to be able to determine what the players will do, one has to
connect the outcome of a game with the players&rsquo; evaluations of this outcome. The
functions ui.e/ assign an evaluation for each player and for each possible outcome,
namely ui W E ! R for player i . Economists use the convention that larger num-
bers are assigned to preferred outcomes. This convention suggests that one calls
ui player i&rsquo;s utility. In RPS, if one assumes that players prefer winning to having
a draw, and having a draw to losing, then any assignment of numbers to outcomes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>258 11 Principles of Game Theory
</p>
<p>with the following property is consistent with this evaluation:
</p>
<p>ui .player i wins/ &gt; ui.draw/ &gt; ui .player i loses/:
</p>
<p>For example, each player could assign 1 to the outcome &lsquo;win,&rsquo; 0 to the outcome
&lsquo;draw,&rsquo; and �1 to the outcome &lsquo;lose.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>The above elements describe a game and can be summarized in the following
way:
</p>
<p>� D fN;S; f; fuigiD1;:::;N g :
</p>
<p>It is often quite useful to sidestep the somewhat lengthy definition by directly
conditioning the players&rsquo; utilities on strategy profiles instead of outcomes. This
is possible, because a strategy profile determines an outcome, which in turn de-
termines utilities: S ! E ! R. One can therefore skip the step in the middle
and assign utilities directly to strategy profiles: ui W S ! R. This shortens the
description of a game and one gets:
</p>
<p>� 0 D fN;S; fuigiD1;:::;N g :
</p>
<p>This representation of a game will be used in the remainder of this chapter. How-
ever, it loses some of the societal content of the situation that is being analyzed:
one no longer knows why players prefer this strategy over that strategy. This is not
relevant from a technical point of view, but it may be important for understanding
the social context that is represented by the game. In RPS, one only knows that
a player prefers .rock; scissors/ to .scissors; rock/, if one specifies � 0. The more
lengthy specification � allows one to answer why this is the case: because the
player wins with the first strategy profile and loses with the second.
</p>
<p>In order to be able to make predictions about the way players play the game, one
needs a hypothesis about the players&rsquo; behavior and the way this behavior is coordi-
nated. Usually, economists work with the so-called (expected) utility-maximization
hypothesis, which states that each player chooses a strategy to maximize her (ex-
pected) utility. If the players are competing firms and if utility can be identified
with profits, then the already familiar profit-maximization hypothesis is an exam-
ple. However, altruistic or even malevolent motives can also be taken into account,
if one uses the more general concept of utility. For example an altruistic player
prefers a distribution of profits (5,5) to a distribution of profits (10,0), whereas a
profit maximizer always prefers (10,0), irrespective of the other player&rsquo;s profits.
</p>
<p>Knowing this, one can assign the optimal reaction of a player to the strategies of
the other players. This information is contained in the so-called reaction function.
Let si 2 Si denote a strategy of each player, i 2 N , and let the strategy profile of
all players except i be denoted by s�i 2 S�i (&lsquo;�i &rsquo; refers to the set of all players
except i). Player i &rsquo;s best responses to the other players&rsquo; strategy profile s�i specifies
the subset of strategies that maximize player i&rsquo;s utility, given strategy profile s�i .
The reaction function of player i collects this player&rsquo;s best responses to all possible
strategy profiles of the other players. The idea can again be exemplified by using</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Normal-Form Games 259
</p>
<p>RPS. If player 2 chooses &lsquo;scissors&rsquo;, then the best response of player 1 is to choose
&lsquo;rock&rsquo;. If player 2 chooses &lsquo;rock&rsquo;, then player 1&rsquo;s best response is &lsquo;paper&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>I Definition 11.1, Reaction function A strategy, s�i 2 Si , that maximizes a player&rsquo;s
utility, ui.si ; s�i /, given the strategies of all other players, s�i 2 S�i , is called his
or her best response to s�i :
</p>
<p>ui.s
�
i ; s�i / � ui .si ; s�i / for all si 2 Si :
</p>
<p>A function that specifies a best response for all possible strategy profiles of all other
players is called the reaction function of player i .
</p>
<p>The concepts &lsquo;best response&rsquo; and &lsquo;reaction function&rsquo; are convenient for solving
a game. A particular kind of best response is called a dominant strategy, which
means that a strategy is a best response to all the other players&rsquo; possible strategy
profiles:
</p>
<p>I Definition 11.2, Dominant strategy A strategy, sdi 2 Si , is called a dominant
strategy, if it is a best response to all possible strategy profiles, s�i 2 S�i :
</p>
<p>ui.s
d
i ; s�i / � ui .si ; s�i / for all si 2 Si and for all s�i 2 S�i :
</p>
<p>If a player has a dominant strategy, then her best response is the same for all s�i .
Therefore, a dominant strategy is a borderline case of strategic interdependence,
because the strategies of all other players, s�i , may influence the utility of player
i , but do not impact which strategy she optimally chooses. However, dominant
strategies often do not exist, as in the example of RPS.
</p>
<p>11.4 Normal-Form Games
</p>
<p>In a so-called normal-form game, all players choose their strategies simultaneously
and are not allowed to alter them during the course of the game. If there are only
two players with only a few strategies, then a normal-form game can be represented
in matrix form, see Table 11.1 for an example. The m1 strategies of player 1 are
represented by the different rows of the matrix, and the m2 strategies of player 2 are
represented by the different columns. Each field of the matrix represents a strategy
profile and displays the corresponding utility levels. For example, u2.s21 ; s
</p>
<p>m2
2 / is
</p>
<p>player 2&rsquo;s utility level from the strategy profile .s21 ; s
m2
2 /, which is implemented, if
</p>
<p>player 1 chooses strategy 2 and player 2 chooses strategy m2.
The best-response function tells us what each player is expected to do when
</p>
<p>confronted with the other players&rsquo; strategy profiles. What is not known, at this point,
is how these best responses are coordinated. In order to be able to make predictions
about the way people are playing games, one has to make an assumption about
how they coordinate their behavior. Such an assumption is called an equilibrium</p>

<p>concept. The most important equilibrium concept for normal-form games is called
a Nash equilibrium, which is named after the US mathematician John F. Nash. A
Nash equilibrium is defined in the following way:
</p>
<p>I Definition 11.3: Nash equilibrium A strategy profile, sne D fsne1 ; : : : ; snen g, is
called Nash equilibrium, if the strategies of all the players are best responses to
the equilibrium strategies of all the other players:
</p>
<p>ui .s
ne
i ; s
</p>
<p>ne
�i / � ui .si ; sne�i / for all si 2 Si and for all i 2 N:
</p>
<p>The idea behind a Nash equilibrium is relatively easy to grasp. Assume there are
two players. Player 1 has two strategies, going to the movies or going to a bar, and
player 2 has two strategies, as well: going to the movies or going to a bar. Each
player i assumes that the other player will stick to his strategy no matter what player
i does. This allows i to determine reaction functions (in which they treat the other
players&rsquo; strategies as parameters).
</p>
<p>However, the players do not only have to figure out what they, but also what the
other player will do. Assume that it is the best response of player 1 to go to the
movies, if player 2 goes to the movies, and to go to a bar, if player 2 goes to a bar
(he wants to meet the other player). What should player 1 do? In order to answer
this question, he has to get into the head of player 2. Assume that player 2 will go
to the movies no matter what 1 is doing. Then, player 1 knows that he should go
to the movies if player 2 does so, and that player 2 will go to the movies no matter
what: thus, the best responses are mutually consistent. The conjecture that player 2
will go to the movies induces player 1 to go there as well and it is a best response
of player 2 to stick to his plan. This mutual consistency is the missing link between
individual reaction functions and the outcome of the game. A Nash equilibrium is
nothing more than such a consistency condition. To see why, focus on the other
possible conjecture that player 1 could make, namely that player 2 will go to a bar.
In that case, the best response would be to go to a bar, as well, to which player
2 reacts by going to the movies, which is not consistent with the conjecture that
player 2 will go to the bar.
</p>
<p>The above argument✍ shows that the players have to be able to figure out the
planned equilibrium strategies of the other players and that they have to believe that
deviations in their own strategy will not cause deviations by any other player (which
is why they can treat their strategies as parameters). However, this is not all. At this
point a player can figure out his or her best strategy for some strategy profile of the
other players and also the best strategies of the other players for some given strategy</p>

</p>
<p>profile. What is missing is that the players know that the other players will use this
logic to solve the game and furthermore that the players know that the other players
know that they will use this logic, and so on. The term common knowledge refers to
a situation where the players have this special kind of knowledge about the beliefs
of the other agents.
</p>
<p>There is common knowledge of some state, z, in a group of players, N , if all
players in N know z, they all know that they know z, they all know that they all
know that they know z, and so on ad infinitum. The next digression illustrates why
common knowledge is important.
</p>
<p>Digression 30. A Tale about the Importance of Common Knowledge
</p>
<p>On an island in the South Seas, there live 100 blue-eyed persons. The rest
have a different eye color. They are perfect logicians and never talk about eye
color. An old custom, to which all citizens adhere, demands that, as soon as
a citizen knows that he or she has blue eyes, he or she will leave the island
during the subsequent night. However, because the citizens never talk about
their eye color and because there is no reflecting surface on the island, no one
knows his or her eye color. Consequently, no one ever leaves the island.
</p>
<p>One day, an outsider comes to the island. He is allowed to stay and soon
acquires a reputation for being completely trustworthy. After a while, a ship
lands and the outsider leaves the island again. At the time of his departure, all
citizens gather at the harbor and the last thing the outsider tells the citizens is:
&ldquo;By the way, there is at least one blue-eyed person on the island!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>What happens during the subsequent nights? Additionally, what does all
this have to do with the concept of common knowledge? The answer is that,
during the 100th night after the announcement, all the blue-eyed people will
leave the island.
</p>
<p>Why does the announcement of the outsider make a difference? Before
his announcement, each islander knew that there are blue-eyed persons on the
island, but she did not know that the other islanders knew it as well, knew
that she knows it, etc. Thus, the knowledge that there are blue-eyed islanders
was not common knowledge. This changed with the announcement by the
outsider. From that moment on, the existence of blue-eyed persons became
common knowledge.
</p>
<p>Why does it make a difference? To see this, one can use an inductive ar-
gument. If there is exactly one person with blue eyes, that person knows that
there is no other person with blue eyes on the island. Before the announce-
ment of the outsider it was a possibility that there is no one with blue eyes on
the island, so there was no need to leave. However, given the information by
the outsider, the blue-eyed person learns that she must have blue eyes, so she
leaves at night one.
</p>
<p>Next, assume that there are two persons with blue eyes. There is no need
for any of them to leave during the first night, because there is a possibility</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>262 11 Principles of Game Theory
</p>
<p>that there is only one person with blue eyes and that it is the other person.
Thus, both will still be around the next day. However, given that both are still
around the next morning, they have to realize that both of them must have
seen another person with blue eyes. Given that there is no one else around, it
must be herself. Therefore, both will leave during night two.
</p>
<p>The same argument holds if there are n blue-eyed persons: induction states
that no one will leave during the first n � 1 nights. However, given that ev-
eryone is still around after night n�1, each blue-eyed person has to conclude
that there are n persons with blue eyes in total, one of them being him- or
herself.
</p>
<p>Thus, the rather innocuous-sounding announcement by the outsider allows
the islanders to eventually figure out the color of their eyes.
</p>
<p>To further illustrate, take the game represented in Table 11.2 as an example. In
this game, two players i D 1; 2 have two strategies each. The game has one Nash
equilibrium, .U;L/. First, one has to show that this strategy profile is, in fact, an
equilibrium. Suppose player 2 chooses &lsquo;L.&rsquo; Player 1&rsquo;s best response is then to
choose &lsquo;U &rsquo; because 4 &gt; 2. Hence, &lsquo;U &rsquo; is a best response to &lsquo;L.&rsquo; If it is a Nash
equilibrium, then &lsquo;L&rsquo; must also be a best response to &lsquo;U ,&rsquo; which is indeed the case,
because 3 &gt; 2. Thus, no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from this
strategy profile. The strategies are mutually best responses and .U;L/ is a Nash
equilibrium.
</p>
<p>There is an easy procedure to determine the set of Nash equilibria for games
in matrix form. First, one successively goes through all the strategies of player 1
and marks the respective best response(s) of player 2. Then one repeats the whole
procedure with the strategies of player 2 and marks player 1&rsquo;s best responses. If
there are fields in which there are marks for both players, then the strategy profile
associated with that field is a Nash equilibrium.
</p>
<p>A Nash equilibrium is a prediction about the outcome of a game, but why should
a game actually be played in such a way? One could argue that an important
property of a Nash equilibrium is stability in the following sense: no player has
an incentive to unilaterally deviate from the equilibrium strategy profile, because
strategies are, by definition, best responses to each other. Players do not regret their
choices of strategies once they find out what the other players are doing. This idea
of consistency sounds plausible and rather innocuous. A potential problem is, how-
ever, that players make their choices simultaneously, that is without observing the
strategies of all other players, and can commit to the strategies while the game is

<p>being played. Hence, each player has to be able to not only determine her own
optimal strategy, but also the optimal strategies of the other players, and therefore
to understand and solve the utility-maximization problems of these players. The
concept of a Nash equilibrium requires both a large extent of implicit agreement
between players that they are in fact seeking to find a Nash equilibrium, as well as
strong cognitive abilities to be able to think through all the different strategic situ-
ations from the perspective of all the players. For instance, in the above example,
player 2 needs to ponder which strategy player 1 will choose. If player 1 chooses
&lsquo;D&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;U &rsquo;, then her best response would not be &lsquo;L,&rsquo; but &lsquo;R&rsquo;. She needs to
conjecture that player 1 will actually assume that a Nash equilibrium will be chosen
and must then put herself into player 1&rsquo;s position. In the example, complexity is
reduced, though, because player 1 has a dominant strategy. Because &lsquo;U &rsquo; is always
a best response, it is the best choice player 1 can make, independent of player 2&rsquo;s
decision. Player 2, being aware of that, is able to predict that 1 will always choose
this strategy, if she is rational. Hence, she will always choose &lsquo;L&rsquo; herself. If a given
player, i , has a dominant strategy, then the complexity of the game is significantly
reduced, because it is easier for all the other players to make predictions.
</p>
<p>One can conjecture that the predictive power of Nash equilibria is better in sit-
uations that are not very complex and if players are more experienced with the
situation with which they are confronted.
</p>
<p>As this subchapter has shown, the problem of cognitive overload can be reduced
significantly, if the solution concept is not a Nash, but a &lsquo;dominant-strategy equilib-
rium.&rsquo; In such an equilibrium, each player follows a dominant strategy and hence
no player needs to conjecture about the strategy choices of all the other players,
because her own optimal choice does not depend on the strategies of all the others.
</p>
<p>I Definition 11.4, Dominant-strategy equilibrium A strategy profile, sds D fsds1 ;
: : : ; sdsn g, is called a dominant-strategy equilibrium, if the strategy of each player is
a dominant strategy:

<p>ui.s
ds
i ; s�i / � ui.si ; s�i / for all si 2 Si ; for all s�i 2 S�i and for all i 2 N:
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, dominant-strategy equilibria exist only for a very limited class of
games, such that it is rarely possible to predict the outcome of a game based on this
equilibrium concept. Hence, using this concept instead of a Nash equilibrium does
not really solve the problem.
</p>
<p>A dominant strategy equilibrium is always a Nash equilibrium, but not vice
versa. This property is exemplified by the game in Table 11.3.
</p>
<p>This game has two Nash equilibria, .U;L/ and .U;R/, and each player has a
dominant strategy, namely &lsquo;U &rsquo; for player 1 and &lsquo;L&rsquo; for 2. Therefore, .U;L/ is also</p>

&lsquo;U .&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Digression 31. Existence of a Nash Equilibrium
</p>
<p>As we have seen when we have analyzed the game in Table 11.3, it is often not
easy to predict the outcome of a game because there may be multiple equilib-
ria. Another problem, which is at least as fundamental as the multiplicity, is
the (non-)existence of Nash equilibria, a potential problem one already knows
from the subchapter covering dominant strategies. Is it possible that a game
has no Nash equilibrium? If so, then what would be a good prediction of the
game&rsquo;s outcome?
</p>
<p>An example for a game in which no Nash equilibrium exists is RPS. A
matrix representation of the game can be found in Table 11.4. Whenever a
player chooses a best response to the strategy of her opponent, the opponent
must end up with a payoff that is smaller than the one that could be achieved
by a different strategy, yielding her a utility of -1. Hence, there cannot be
a profile of strategies that are mutually best responses and, thus, no Nash
equilibrium exists.
</p>
<p>A game that does not have an equilibrium is quite unsatisfactory, because
this means one cannot make a prediction about the way people play it, which
was why we started with game theory in the first place. Consequently, re-
searchers started searching for a way out of this problem and found one in
the idea of &ldquo;mixed strategies.&rdquo; The idea is quite simple: put yourself in the
position of a player in RPS. It is immediately clear that you want to avoid
the other player knowing what you will do, because she could then exploit
this knowledge, which would guarantee you a payoff of -1. Hence, how can
you ensure that she does not know what you will do and is not able to pre-
dict it, either? One possibility is to delegate the strategy choice to a random
generator that chooses each strategy with a given probability that you deter-
mine at the beginning. This is precisely the idea underlying mixed strategies.
A mixed strategy is a probability distribution over the (as they will be called
from now on) pure strategies at your disposal. If one allows players to choose
probability distributions over pure strategies, then one increases the set of
possible strategies, because each probability distribution over pure strategies
also becomes a strategy &ndash; a mixed strategy. A Nash equilibrium, in which at</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Normal-Form Games 265
</p>
<p>least one player uses a mixed strategy, is called a mixed strategy Nash equi-
librium.
</p>
<p>However, what is the point of this exercise? In games like RPS, no Nash
equilibrium exists in pure, but only in mixed strategies. In RPS, the equilib-
rium is easy to find: each player chooses a pure strategy with the probability
of 1/3. For example, if player 1 chooses a pure strategy with that probability,
then player 2 receives the following expected utility from each of her pure
strategies:

</p>
<p>Player 1&rsquo;s mixed strategy makes player 2 indifferent between all of her pure
strategies and, thus, each of her pure strategies is a best response. This is, in
turn, the precondition for her to be willing to randomize herself. If she ran-
domizes herself with the same probabilities, then player 2 is also indifferent
between all her pure strategies and each pure strategy, as well as the mixed
strategy, is a best response. Therefore, it is a Nash equilibrium in mixed
strategies, if both players randomize and choose each pure strategy with a
probability of 1/3.
</p>
<p>As the example shows, one can come up with a clear prediction of the
game&rsquo;s outcome, if one allows for a more comprehensive concept of a strat-
egy. It was one of John Nash&rsquo;s seminal contributions to show that such an
equilibrium exists under very general conditions.
</p>
<p>Result 11.1, Nash&rsquo;s theorem Every game with a finite number of players
and a finite number of pure strategies has at least one Nash equilibrium in
mixed strategies.
</p>
<p>This result of Nash&rsquo;s theorem is of fundamental importance, because it
guarantees that a prediction about the outcome of a game, based on the con-
cept of a Nash equilibrium, is possible under very general conditions. I omit
the proof of the theorem, because it involves advanced mathematical meth-
ods.
</p>
<p>Another example of a game in which no Nash equilibrium exists in pure
strategies is the penalty kick in soccer. The goalkeeper decides which part of
the goal to defend, while the kicker simultaneously decides where to place
the shot. If the goalkeeper conjectures the kicker&rsquo;s strategy correctly, then
she successfully defends the shot; otherwise the kicker is successful. In or-
der to be able to analyze this situation one can simplify and assume that each
player has the pure strategies &lsquo;left,&rsquo; &lsquo;middle&rsquo; and &lsquo;right.&rsquo; The game has a Nash
equilibrium in mixed strategies, in which each player randomizes by choos-
ing among the pure strategies with a probability of 1/3. Economists studied</p>

French professional soccer leagues. They found that the observed behavior

</p>
<p>11.4.1 Multiple Equilibria
</p>
<p>This chapter has shown so far that some games, for example the one in Table 11.3,
have multiple Nash equilibria. There are at least two problems caused by the mul-
tiplicity of equilibria. First, the predictive power of a theory that makes several
predictions is limited and, second, it is only of limited use in supporting players
with identifying optimal strategies. The problems are dramatic in the game repre-
sented by Table 11.3 because any strategy of a player can be rationalized, even if
there are only two equilibria. The players have to, somehow, coordinate on one of
the two equilibria in order to exclude some kinds of behavior as implausible. With-
out such a coordination, a formal analysis of the game is useless, from the point
of view of the predictive power of the theory as well as from the point of view of
giving advice how to play it.
</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to employ a stronger solution concept, for exam-
ple an equilibrium in dominant strategies. The game in Table 11.3, for example, has
two Nash equilibria, but only one equilibrium in dominant strategies. As argued be-
fore, not many games have equilibria in dominant strategies and, among them, there
are some that have more than one.
</p>
<p>Another possible solution to the problem of multiple equilibria is to hypothe-
size that players can coordinate on so-called &ldquo;focal&rdquo; strategies. The term focal was
coined by Schelling (1960) and implies that some equilibria are, in a sense, more
&ldquo;salient&rdquo; than others. However, the concept of focality is weak. It is not quite clear
how to precisely define what makes an equilibrium focal and whether or not an
equilibrium is focal depends on many things, such as the context of the respective
game. In Schelling&rsquo;s own words (p. 57): &ldquo;People can often concert their inten-
tions or expectations with others if each knows that the other is trying to do the
same. Most situations &ndash; perhaps every situation for people who are practiced at
this kind of game &ndash; provide some clue for coordinating behavior, some focal point
for each person&rsquo;s expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be ex-
pected to do. Finding the key, or rather finding a key &ndash; any key that is mutually
recognized as the key becomes the key &ndash; may depend on imagination more than
on logic; it may depend on analogy, precedent, accidental arrangement, symmetry,
aesthetic or geometric configuration, casuistic reasoning, and who the parties are
and what they know about each other.&rdquo; The idea of focal points is, therefore, not
a full-fledged theoretical concept, but merely a heuristic one that helps determine
how players behave in certain situations. Here is an illustrative example. Assume
that you and another player have to pick one out of three numbers. If you pick</p>

</p>
<p>identical numbers, then everybody wins CHF 10; otherwise, nobody gets anything.
In that game, each pair of identical numbers is a Nash equilibrium and dominant-
strategy equilibria do not exist. Now, assume the set of numbers you can pick from
is 0.73285, 1 and 1.3857. In this situation, many people intuitively pick the integer
1. All pairs, f0:73285; 0:73285g, f1; 1g and f1:3857; 1:3857g, are Nash equilibria,
but only f1; 1g is focal, although it is very difficult to theoretically identify why.
</p>
<p>In some games with multiple equilibria, the equilibria can be ranked according to
the payoffs or utilities that the players receive. If one equilibrium makes everyone
better off than all the others, it is a strong candidate for a focal point.
</p>
<p>I Definition 11.5, Pareto dominance A Nash equilibrium is Pareto dominant, if
each player&rsquo;s utility is strictly larger in it than in all other Nash equilibria.
</p>
<p>An illustrative example for such a situation is depicted in Table 11.5. The basic
story underlying this payoff matrix goes as follows. Two businessmen are planning
to meet at noon in New York City, but have forgotten to fix a meeting point. The
possible meeting points are the information desk at Grand Central Terminal (GCT),
the main entrance to the Empire State Building (ESB), and the bull and bear statue
at Wall Street (WS). If they do not meet, they get a utility of zero each. If they meet
at ESB or WS, both of them get a utility of 1. However, because their favorite cafe
is close to GCT, they get a utility of 3, if they manage to meet there.
</p>
<p>The game has three Nash equilibria: all the strategy profiles where the busi-
nessmen go to the same place. However, since there are multiple equilibria, it is
not possible to predict what the businessmen will end up doing on the basis of
this solution concept alone. In addition, there are no equilibria in dominant strate-
gies. However, the equilibrium .GCT;GCT/ Pareto improves the others and, hence,
might be focal. Using the idea of Pareto improvements as a means to select be-
tween equilibria is promising, because it can be assumed that people have a strong
tendency to coordinate on the better ones.
</p>
<p>Still, it has to be taken into account that, while the concept of Pareto dominance
may often be helpful in predicting the outcome of a game, this is not always the
case. First, it may be the case that equilibria cannot be ranked according to Pareto
dominance, such that the concept is not applicable to these games. Second, there
may be multiple Pareto dominant Nash equilibria. In these games it may be possible
to reduce the number of plausible Nash equilibria, but the multiplicity problem
cannot be overcome completely. If, for example, the utility of meeting at the ESB
is also 3 for each player, then it is possible to exclude (WS;WS) as a &ldquo;likely&rdquo;
equilibrium, but a prognosis about the game&rsquo;s outcome is still not possible; both the
(GCT;GCT) and the (ESB;ESB) equilibria are Pareto dominant.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>268 11 Principles of Game Theory
</p>
<p>It is even possible for players to coordinate to play out a Pareto-dominated equi-
librium, even though each of them would prefer a different outcome? Even the
worst equilibrium (in utility terms) is an equilibrium and unilateral deviations are
not beneficial. An example for such a situation is inefficient production standards,
like the so-called QWERTY keyboard, which stems from the arrangement of letters
on the (US) keyboard that begins with the sequence q,w,e,r,t,y. The arrangement
of the letters on a keyboard was determined in the times of the mechanical type-
writer. The purpose of its design was to maximize an effective typing speed. With
mechanical typewriters, there is always the risk that the typebars will entangle, if
one&rsquo;s typing is too fast. For that reason, the arrangement of letters on the QWERTY
keyboard did not maximize the potential, but instead the effective typing speed.
With the invention of the electric typewriter, the problem of entangled typebars was
solved, but the then inefficient QWERTY arrangement remains in use until today.
The standard is inefficient, but it is also an equilibrium. In that example, one of
the reasons why it is hard to coordinate on another, more efficient equilibrium is
that the expectations of the players are shaped by history. The new, more efficient
equilibrium is counterfactual and it lives only in our imagination, whereas the other,
less efficient equilibrium has been played out for years and decades. History can,
therefore, be a more powerful focal mechanism than Pareto dominance is.
</p>
<p>Another important example for multiple equilibria is public transportation. Sup-
pose creating and maintaining a public transportation system has fixed as well as
variable costs per user. In order to cover the fixed costs, users must pay taxes that
equal the fixed costs divided by the number of users and the variable costs (for ex-
ample as user fees). If the number of users is small, the costs per user are high,
which implies that it is individually rational to rely on private transportation. If the
number of users is high, costs per user are low and this can create a virtuous circle
where people rely heavily on public transportation. Switzerland is an example for a
country with a dense, reliable and affordable public transportation system, whereas
most metropolitan areas in the USA heavily rely on private transportation.

<p>Digression 32. The Economics of Social Media
</p>
<p>The QWERTY keyboard may seem like an odd example for inefficient stan-
dards that is without much relevance for the functioning of the economy. The
conclusion that coordination problems are only of secondary relevance would
be premature, however, because the problem of multiple equilibria underlying
the choice of inefficient production standards is at the heart of a lot of digital
technologies. Take social media as an example. The attractivity of websites
like Facebook or AirBnB depends on the number of users. The more users
these websites have, the more attractive they are. This phenomenon is called
a network externality. Network externalities can easily dominate quality dif-
ferences between the different sites, like user friendliness, transparency or
privacy. A platform that offers poorer quality may nonetheless survive (and
even thrive), simply because it is used by a larger number of customers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Normal-Form Games 269
</p>
<p>When one looks at these industries, one finds a typical pattern. In the
early stages, there are usually several competing platforms, like Facebook,
Friendster, MySpace or Xanga, and it is, ex ante, unclear which one will
succeed. In the language of game theory, the game has multiple equilibria:
one where the majority of users coordinate on Facebook and others where
they coordinate on any one of the other platforms. Objective differences in the
quality of the different platforms are a poor predictor for their future success.
The number of users, however, is. The fastest-growing platforms are usually
the ones that will outcompete the others and, once they dominate the market,
it is very hard for new entrants to succeed, even if they offer much better
quality. The large quantity of users protects the incumbent against market
entries.
</p>
<p>11.4.2 Collectively and Individually Rational Behavior
</p>
<p>Another important topic that is, by now, better understood, because of game theo-
retic reasoning, is whether or not one should expect that self-interested behavior of
individuals leads to outcomes that benefit a group&rsquo;s welfare. Game theory can play
an important role in answering these questions by identifying mathematical struc-
tures that lead to certain equilibria. The structural characteristics of such a game,
which lead to certain types of equilibria, can help social scientists to detect patterns
that help them to interpret and grasp situations in the real world.
</p>
<p>In order to illustrate this point, I will introduce one of the most famous games:
the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. What is the historical background of this game? I discussed
the First and Second Theorem of Welfare Economics in Chap. 5. According to these
theorems, market equilibria are Pareto-efficient under certain conditions. The Coase
Irrelevance Theorem has generalized these conditions and opened a perspective for
a better understanding of the factors that explain differences between institutions:
transaction costs. Way into the 20th century, many economists were convinced that
the &ldquo;invisible hand,&rdquo; as Adam Smith had coined it, is reality: if man follows his or
her self-interest, then the interests of the rest of society are taken care of and there
is no tension between individual self-interest and societal welfare.
</p>
<p>This vision of a frictionless society can be illustrated by the following &ldquo;invisible-
hand game given in Table 11.6:&rdquo; In this game, the two players have two strategies,
M;F , each and both have a dominant strategy to play F . Hence, .F; F / is a unique
Nash, as well as a dominant-strategy, equilibrium. It is, at the same time, Pareto-
efficient.
</p>

game

</p>
<p>M 3; 3 10; 1
</p>
<p>F 1; 10 7; 7
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;invisible-hand game&rdquo; reveals no deeper truth about our social reality; in
the end, it should not surprise one that it is possible to tinker with utilities such
that a unique, Pareto-efficient equilibrium exists. The really important question is
whether the game is meaningful to describe the social world.
</p>
<p>Now that one has started to tinker with utilities, one will most likely end up
with the game given in Table 11.7. Together with the invisible-hand game, this
game became the most famous metaphor for the logic of social interactions. It was
developed by the mathematicians Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher. The name
&ldquo;prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma&rdquo; is due to Albert W. Tucker, who adapted the game by Flood
and Dresher, but framed it in a different context where two individuals have com-
mitted a crime and can either confess or not. (Both are better off collectively, if
they do not confess, but each person is individually better off confessing. Hence,
the name prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma.)
</p>
<p>The game is a parable applicable to many economically relevant situations, for
example the tragedy of the commons that was discussed in Chap. 6. Table 11.7
shows a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma in matrix form. Two players can choose between two
strategies, &lsquo;M &rsquo; and &lsquo;F .&rsquo; The central characteristic of the game is that it is optimal to
choose &lsquo;M &rsquo; for each player individually; that .M;M/ is a dominant-strategy equi-
librium. However, in a concerted effort, both players could increase their respective
utility by choosing &lsquo;F .&rsquo; Applied to the example of the tragedy of the commons, one
can interpret the game as follows: two fishermen live on a lake, where they catch
fish to make a living. While going out to catch fish, they have the choice between
catching many fish (&lsquo;M &rsquo;) or just a few (&lsquo;F &rsquo;). If both choose &lsquo;F ,&rsquo; both can sell only
a smaller quantity, but at higher prices and the fishing grounds stay intact, which
guarantees future income. One normalizes the utility associated with this strategy
to 7. If both choose &lsquo;M &rsquo;, they can sell a lot, but prices are low and fish stocks dwin-
dle due to overfishing. This leads to utilities of 3. If one fisherman chooses &lsquo;M ,&rsquo;
while the other chooses &lsquo;F ,&rsquo; the fish stocks also dwindle, but to a lesser extent. The
fisherman choosing &lsquo;M &rsquo; sells a lot at moderate prices, while the other sells a small
quantity. In this situation, the fisherman choosing &lsquo;M &rsquo; gets a utility of 10, while the
other receives only 1.
</p>
<p>Because both players have the dominant strategy to choose &lsquo;M ,&rsquo; it seems clear,
if one believes in invisible hands, that the equilibrium should have good welfare
properties. But this is wrong. If both players could coordinate and play &lsquo;F ,&rsquo; then
both would be better off. The decentralized decisions of the players are individually,
but not collectively, rational.</p>

<p>11.4 Normal-Form Games 271
</p>
<p>11.4.3 Simple Games as Structural Metaphors
</p>
<p>Coming back ˆto the starting point of this chapter, the analysis of two-player two-
strategy games reveals a lot about the fundamental problems that can exist when
individual decisions are mutually dependent. These simple games illustrate the
problems societies are confronted with in a nutshell.
</p>
<p>� There can be situations with a unique equilibrium that is also efficient. In such a
situation, there is no tension between individual and collective rationality.
</p>
<p>� There may be a unique equilibrium that is inefficient. In such a situation, there
is tension between individual and collective rationality. Situations of this type
are referred to as &ldquo;cooperation problems,&rdquo; because individual incentives impede
beneficial cooperation.
</p>
<p>� Multiple equilibria may exist. Situations like these are called &ldquo;coordination prob-
lems,&rdquo; because they represent the fundamental challenge to coordinate on an
equilibrium.
</p>
<p>The above classification of potential problems is useful, because it provides a
framework for interpreting problem structures in many different societal contexts.
Chapter 6 already analyzed the problem of overfishing (the tragedy of the commons)
and showed that it is inherently a cooperation problem. It can also be argued that
the social and economic causes of anthropogenic climate change are unresolved
cooperation problems.
</p>
<p>Digression 33. Cooperation Problems and Externalities
</p>
<p>This is a good point to hint at an important link between different concepts
that have been discussed in this book. I discussed the concept of external-
ities in Chap. 6. An externality exists, if the acts of an individual, A, have
an impact on the well-being of another individual, B , that A does not take
into consideration: it is a non-internalized interdependency. Looking at co-
operation problems, like the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma, one sees that it is exactly an
externality that is at the heart of the problem: the rational behavior of one in-
dividual makes the other individual worse-off, but the individuals do not find
a way to internalize this effect. Hence, cooperation problems are metaphors
for situations with mutual externalities, like anthropogenic climate change.
</p>
<p>I also discussed the ontology of money in Chap. 3 and one can now interpret it
in the context of a simple game. Money has no intrinsic value and its value, as a
medium of exchange and storage of wealth, relies on a convention: an agreement
between people to accept money as a medium of exchange. If everybody complies,
the simplified exchange of goods has positive effects on the economy and this is also
an equilibrium. If a single individual stops accepting money, nothing bad happens
for the rest of society. However, if nobody accepts money as a medium of exchange,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>272 11 Principles of Game Theory
</p>
<p>it is rational for each individual to not accept money, either, and the economy has
to rely on barter. The important fact is that both, a monetary and a barter economy,
are equilibria. Due to the multiplicity of equilibria, one of the central challenges
of an economy that relies on some abstract medium of exchange is to stabilize
peoples&rsquo; expectations, such that they believe in the convention and are willing to
accept money. The stabilization of expectations is not always easy, as can be seen
in times of economic crises when there a the danger of so-called &ldquo;bank runs.&rdquo; A
bank run is a situation in which many people lose trust in a bank&rsquo;s solvency and
try to get back their savings. If enough people do that, then the belief becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy and the bank actually gets into trouble. Many phenomena
on financial markets have a similar structure and are better understood once they are
interpreted as coordination problems. Bank runs and financial crises are examples
of why game theory is important in macroeconomics and finance and why it came
to new fame during the global financial crises in recent years.
</p>
<p>The three classes of problems described above are, in principle, prototypes for
most of the problems that one will encounter during one&rsquo;s studies. If one keeps
them in mind, it will be easier to understand the fundamental structure underlying
the different theories.
</p>
<p>Digression 34. The Cold War as a Gameˆ
</p>
<p>Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy the fear to attack. (Stan-
ley Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove)
</p>
<p>During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were in a nu-
clear stand-off. Thus, the RAND Corporation (a major US think tank) hired
some of the world&rsquo;s top game theorists to study the situation. At the time,
both nations had the same policy, &ldquo;If one side launched a first strike, the other
threatened to answer with a devastating counter-strike.&rdquo; This became known
as Mutually Assured Destruction, or MAD, for short. Game theorists got wor-
ried about the rationality and, thereby, the credibility of MAD. The argument
goes like this, &ldquo;Suppose the USSR launches a first strike against the USA. At
that point, the American President finds his country already destroyed. He
doesn&rsquo;t bring it back to life by now blowing up the world, so he has no in-
centive to carry out his original threat to retaliate, which has now manifestly
failed to achieve its point. Since the Russians can anticipate this, they should
ignore the threat to retaliate and strike first. Of course, the Americans are
in an exactly symmetric position, so they too should strike first. Each power
will recognize this incentive on the part of the other, and so will anticipate an
attack if they don&rsquo;t rush to preempt it. What we should therefore expect is a
race between the two powers to be the first to attack.&rdquo; (Don Ross 2016)
</p>
<p>This analysis led the RAND Corporation to recommend that the United
States take actions designed to show their commitment to MAD. One strategy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.5 Extensive-Form Games 273
</p>
<p>was to ensure that &ldquo;second-strike capability&rdquo; existed. A second strategy was
to make leaders appear irrational. The CIA portrayed President Nixon as
either insane or a drunk. The KGB, which appears to have come to the same
conclusion as RAND, responded by fabricating medical records to show that
General Secretary Brezhnev was senile.
</p>
<p>Another strategy was to introduce uncertainty about the ability to stop a
counterstrike, for example by building more nuclear missiles and storing them
in numerous locations (which made it less likely that the President could stop
all of them from being launched in the event of a Soviet attack). A third
strategy was to make MAD credible by creating &ldquo;doomsday machines&rdquo;: tech-
nologies that carry out a counterstrike automatically, without the ability of
human beings to interfere. The USSR went so far as to create Perimeter,
or Dead Head, which was the closest thing this world has ever seen to such a
doomsday machine. It can automatically trigger the launch of intercontinental
ballistic missiles, if a nuclear strike is detected by seismic, light, radioactivity
and overpressure sensors.
</p>
<p>It is commonplace to suggest that the strategic situation during the Cold
War was a case of the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. However, it is far from obvious that
the leaderships in either country in fact attached the necessary payoffs in their
utility functions &ndash; preferring the destruction of the world to their own unique
destruction &ndash; that would have been required for their situation to actually have
been a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma.
</p>
<p>11.5 Extensive-FormGames
</p>
<p>Up until this point, one has not been able to analyze situations where players choose
their strategies sequentially instead of simultaneously. Many social phenomena
cannot be adequately described as simultaneous-move games, because timing plays
an important role.
</p>
<p>If the order ✍of play is important, then games are usually not depicted in matrix
representation but with the help of a game tree. A game tree describes what actions
any given player has at the different points in time and how these actions influence
the further course of the game. Formally, a game tree is a directed graph with
nodes as positions in a game, where the players have to make decisions and edges
represent the possible decisions (moves). The nodes are also called decision nodes
in game theory.
</p>
<p>As an example for such a game tree, take Fig. 11.1. The game is a version of the
so-called centipede game (it is called that, because the game tree looks a bit like a
centipede, if there are enough decisions that the players have to make). There are
two players, i D 1; 2, and three decision nodes, T D f1:1; 2; 1:2g. Player 1 has to</p>

<p>make a decision at nodes 1.1 and 1.2, while player 2 only decides at node 2. Both
players have a choice between the same actions at every node, Ati D fa; f g, t 2 T .
</p>
<p>The concept of a strategy✍ is more complex than before. A strategy is a rule
that determines an action for every potential node in the game. Because player 1
has to make a decision at two decision nodes, a strategy assigns an action to both,
irrespective of whether both nodes are reached during the course of the game or
not. This complete list of actions, one for each decision node where a player has to
make decision, is called an action profile.
</p>
<p>One has to specify a complete contingency plan for each player, because oth-
erwise it would not be possible to solve the game. If a player contemplates her
optimal strategy, she has to be able to figure out how the game ends, if she goes for
this or for that strategy. This is only possible, if all players specify what they will
do at each decision node.
</p>
<p>The set of possible strategies of a player equals the set of possible action profiles.
Player 1&rsquo;s strategy set is S1 D faa; af; fa; ff g where, for example, s1 D af is
interpreted as player 1 choosing a at decision node 1:1 and f at decision node 1.2.
Because player 2 decides only once during the game, at node 2, her strategy set
equals the set of actions she has at this node, S2 D A22 D fa; f g.
</p>
<p>As in normal-form games, each strategy profile leads to an outcome, which is
represented by the players&rsquo; utilities. For instance, the strategy profile .af; f / im-
plies that the game ends immediately and that players&rsquo; utilities are u1.af; f / D 1
and u2.af; f / D 0.
</p>
<p>Solution concepts are defined by means of an analogy to normal-form games
and, hence, extensive-form games can basically be solved in the same way as games
in normal-form once the strategies are defined. However, due to the more complex
structure, there may be some problems related to the concept of a Nash equilibrium
that did not exist before: Nash equilibria can be based on so-called &ldquo;empty threats.&rdquo;
In order to see what that means, take a look at the game in Fig. 11.2, the chainstore
game (or market-entry game). Two firms, i D 1; 2, are potentially competing in a
market. If firm 1 does not enter the market, NE, then the incumbent firm, 2, has
a monopoly. If firm 1 enters, E, then firm 2 has two options: to start a price war,
PW , or to accommodate, A. The game has two Nash equilibria in pure strategies:
NE;PW and E;A. Because no player has a dominant strategy and no equilibrium</p>

</p>
<p>is Pareto dominant, the concepts that were discussed thus far are of little help in
determining the game&rsquo;s outcome.
</p>
<p>However, one can use the sequential structure of the decisions to distinguish
between the different equilibria. Because firm 1 makes her decision before firm
2, firm 2&rsquo;s choice &lsquo;PW &rsquo; is not credible. If firm 1 enters the market, firm 2&rsquo;s best
response is &lsquo;A.&rsquo; The threat to start a price war if firm 1 enters is not credible, because
it relies on the assumption that firm 1 does not enter. However, .NE;PW / is still a
Nash equilibrium, since unilateral deviations are not beneficial for any firm.
</p>
<p>A concept ✍that will help one to identify such non-credible strategies is called
backward induction. Intuitively, backward induction can be described as &ldquo;think-
ing ahead and reasoning backward:&rdquo; In a first step, one determines the individual
&ldquo;subgames&rdquo; of a game, i.e. the parts of the game tree that can be interpreted and an-
alyzed as independent games. For example, the chainstore game has two subgames:
one starting with firm 2&rsquo;s decision node and another that is the whole game.
</p>
<p>In a next step, one looks at the terminal subgames and determines the optimal
actions chosen at these nodes. A subgame is a terminal subgame, if the game ends
thereafter, no matter what the player who makes a decision does. In the chain-
store game, the subgame that starts at firm 2&rsquo;s decision node is a terminal subgame,
whereas the whole game is not because, if firm 1 enters the market, the game goes
on and firm 2 makes a decision.
</p>
<p>Once the optimal decisions at the terminal nodes have been determined, then
the terminal subgame is replaced by the utilities the players get from the optimal
play. For example, in the chainstore game, the terminal subgame starts at decision
node 2 and firm 2&rsquo;s best action is to choose &lsquo;A,&rsquo; because this yields a higher utility
than starting a price war &lsquo;PW .&rsquo; Hence, in this step, the last subgame is replaced
by the utilities achieved through this action, (2,1). Replacing the terminal subgame
with the utility vector makes the game tree &ldquo;shorter&rdquo; and there are new terminal
subgames. This procedure needs to be repeated until the start of the game is reached.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>276 11 Principles of Game Theory
</p>
<p>In the chainstore example, this is the case after replacing node 2, when firm 1 faces
the decision to enter the market, which gives her a utility of 2, or to stay out of
the market, which gives her a utility of 1. Since entering the market gives her a
greater utility, she will do exactly this and choose &lsquo;E.&rsquo; Therefore, only one Nash
equilibrium remains after backward induction, .E;A/, and the other equilibrium,
.NE;PW /, which contained the empty threat to start a price war, is eliminated.
</p>
<p>By solving the game from its end, one can reduce its complexity step by step.
Players who need to determine their optimal choices at earlier nodes can rely on a
continuation of the game that is always (at every decision node) optimal for each
player.
</p>
<p>Digression 35. Chess and the Existence of Backward-Induction Equilibria
</p>
<p>One of the first formal game theoretic studies was Ernst Zermelo&rsquo;s analysis
of the game of chess. Chess can be interpreted as an extensive form game
between two players, but the game&rsquo;s complexity makes it impossible to write
down the players&rsquo; strategies, to draw a game tree, or to solve it (at least with
today&rsquo;s means). However, Zermelo was able to show that there is an optimal,
deterministic way to play chess. This result also illustrates why backward-
induction equilibria must exist, if each player has a finite number of strategies.
</p>
<p>Certain rules in chess guarantee that it cannot go on forever (see Article
5.2 of the official Fide chess rules) and, thus, every player has finitely many
strategies. The conditions that Zermelo found to be necessary in his proof are
hence met and it is, therefore, proven that either white has a winning strategy,
or that black has a winning strategy, or that both can force at least a draw.
</p>
<p>Until now, nobody has been able to find out whether white or black has
a winning strategy or whether each player can force a draw. Therefore, of
course, nobody knows the optimal strategy to play chess. Zermelo&rsquo;s result is,
in this respect, a rather strange mathematical theorem: one knows that there
is an optimal way to play chess, but one does not know what the optimal
strategies are. Fortunately, one might say, because this is why the game of
chess remains interesting.
</p>
<p>Zermelo&rsquo;s theorem has important implication for other games, as well.
First, it reveals that, under quite general conditions, a pure strategy equilib-
rium exists when players move sequentially. Furthermore, it shows that this
equilibrium is not based on empty threats. These two points are of importance
for the ability to predict the outcomes of extensive-form games.
</p>
<p>11.6 Summary
</p>
<p>One has seen that game theory is an analytical tool that helps one to analyze situa-
tions of strategic interdependence. This method has proven to be extremely versatile
and has generated interesting insights far beyond the narrow field of economics,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.6 Summary 277
</p>
<p>ranging from political science, law and business administration to evolutionary biol-
ogy. A topic that I have not covered in this chapter is that the insights of game theory
also paved the way for behavioral economics and neuroeconomics. Even in simple
games, the required cognitive abilities for the players to find a Nash equilibrium
are so high that it became apparent that rational-choice models of decision-making
have poor predictive power in a number of situations. In addition, problems like the
prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma spurred literatures on the cultural and genetic roots of coopera-
tive behavior, which has been generating fascinating insights into the evolutionary
and cultural forces that have shaped our brains and our perceptions of reality.
</p>
<p>Digression 36. Games as Structural Metaphors: Further Examples ˆ
This chapter has already clarified that game theory is a method and that games
with specific sequences of moves and payoff structures are problem struc-
tures, which are not tied to specific interpretations, but that can be used as
metaphors for a wide array of social phenomena. This versatility is one of
game theory&rsquo;s strengths, because it allows one to understand the strategic
similarities between, apparently, very different social spheres. Here are some
examples for social phenomena that have aspects of the chainstore game:
</p>
<p>� Military conflicts: Situations that are very similar in their logic to the
market-entry problem can be found in many military conflicts. Often,
one party in a conflict threatens to attack another party, should that party
continue with some provocative action. However, if there were an actual
attack, both parties would be worse off.
</p>
<p>� Bailouts: The state has an interest in ensuring that its major banks are
managed in a way that makes situations of serious financial stress unlikely.
However, if a major bank gets into financial trouble, the economic conse-
quences for the rest of the country are so severe that the state bails it out.
If banks anticipate this incentive, they know that they are at least partially
insured against failure and so they have an incentive to invest in riskier
strategies, which increases the likelihood that a bailout will become nec-
essary. The major challenge for a state is, therefore, to make a no-bailout
strategy credible. This is, of course, the exact situation that Switzerland,
the USA and other European countries faced during the financial crises that
started in 2007, and it also illustrates some of the EU&rsquo;s problems regarding
institutional reforms in some of its member states.
</p>
<p>� Legalization of illegal immigrants: Countries want to restrict and control
illegal immigration. Therefore, it is in their best interest to signal a tough
policy towards potential illegal immigrants in order to prevent them from
attempting to migrate. It is in light of this background that the debate about
the legalization of illegal immigrants in the USA can be understood. The
Obama administration was largely in favor of legalizing this group of peo-
ple. President Barack Obama said in a press conference on September 06</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>278 11 Principles of Game Theory
</p>
<p>2014 that, although his &ldquo;preference is to see Congress act,&rdquo; he intended to
take unilateral action in order to give illegal aliens &ldquo;some path&rdquo; to &ldquo;be
legal,&rdquo; if Congress did not enact the sort of immigration legislation he
wanted (at that time congress was being controlled by a Republican major-
ity that was mostly against legalization). Advocates of the pro-legalization
camp typically use two types of arguments to support their views: human-
itarian and economic (illegal immigrants are, for example, an important
part of the Californian agricultural industry). Opponents often argue that
legalization sends the wrong signals, because it encourages immigration.
</p>
<p>� Touchiness can pay off: Now, it is time to get to the really important stuff.
Think of a typical situation in a partnership. You can stay home for the
night with TV and crackers (your partnership has reached a mature stage)
or you can go out with friends, but without your significant other. You
think the latter alternative is much more fun, but only if your significant
other does not create a scene the next morning. Your partner would be
jealous if you go out without him or her, but he or she also shies away
from making a scene. Thus, if you actually went he or she would give in
and make the best out of the evening. However, he or she would profit
from a reputation of being touchy.
</p>
<p>The art and craft of a social scientist is to boil complex social phenomena
down to their essential strategic structures. This is not always easy, as the
discussion of the Cold War as a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma game has shown, and a
reconstruction of the above situations as chainstore games may be wrong or
misleading in a given situation. Everyone is well aware that, if one has a
hammer, everything looks like a nail and it is the same with game theory: if
one has, for example, the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma as a device for making sense of
things, then suddenly everything looks like a cooperation problem.
</p>
<p>Fascinating as these topics may be, it is now time to come back to the analysis
of prototypical markets, which is why I had to cover game theory in the first place.
Markets rarely fit to the ideals of perfect competition or monopoly and, next, I
will apply the methods from game theory to creating a better understanding of the
functioning of oligopoly markets. Usually, firms have some control over prices.
However, that is limited by the existence of competitors. Thus, there are important
strategic interdependencies that have to be taken into account, if one wants to make
meaningful predictions about the functioning of these markets. Game theory is the
analytical toolbox for achieving this.</p>

<p>Models of markets with perfect competition and monopolistic markets pinpoint ex-
treme cases. They illustrate and help to understand how markets work. However,
the stylized nature of these models makes it necessary for them to abstract from
aspects of reality that may be relevant for understanding some markets. One such
aspect &ndash; strategic interdependence of firm decisions &ndash; will be the topic of this chap-
ter.
</p>
<p>This chapter starts with a short summary of the central results from the theory of
competitive and monopolistic markets:
</p>
<p>� Perfect competition: There are many suppliers of an identical product and each
seller assumes that she cannot influence the market price with her decisions. Un-
der certain conditions, price-taking behavior leads to the &ldquo;price-equals-marginal-
costs&rdquo; rule for the profit maximizing choice of output and, at the same time, to
the Pareto efficiency of this type of market, because all potential gains from trade

</p>
<p>are exploited. Two additional conditions, however, have to be met to make this
rule rational. On the one hand, producer surplus has to exceed the relevant fixed
costs. On the other hand, the production technology has to induce increasing or
constant long-run marginal costs. If competitive markets work, then market entry
and exit will drive profits to zero, because positive (negative) profits encourage
entry (force exits).
The managerial implications of these findings point towards the crucial impor-
tance of having an effective accounting system: marginal and average costs of
production have to be precisely reflected in the relevant indicators. In addition,
given that profits are approximately zero with constant returns to scale or, in the
long run, the return on equity cannot exceed the return on debt, owners cannot
expect larger profits from their investments than they would get in the capital
market.
</p>
<p>� Monopoly: Only one supplier of a product exists, which implies that customers
see a relevant difference between this product and the closest substitute and that
other firms cannot imitate it. Compared to competitive markets, a monopo-
list generates a higher producer surplus, such that it can sustain itself, even if
fixed costs would drive competitive firms out of the market (if they are not too
high). The efficiency of such a market depends on the monopolist&rsquo;s ability to
discriminate prices. The closer the monopolist gets to the ideal of perfect price
discrimination, the more efficient the market becomes. However, there is a ten-
sion between the efficiency of monopolistic markets and the distribution of rents
between the firm and the consumers, because in the efficient solution, the mo-
nopolist is able to transform all rents into producer surplus.
In order to implement the optimal policy, the firm needs more information
than under perfect competition. In addition to an accounting system, it needs a
market-research department that estimates price elasticities and helps to segment
demand into different groups that are targeted individually.
</p>
<p>These findings give some mileage in understanding firm behavior and the func-
tioning of markets, but the important topic of the strategic interdependence of firms&rsquo;
decision making has been left out of the picture. Strategic interdependence does not
play any role in a monopolistic market, by definition, and it does not play a role in
competitive markets, because each single firm is too small to influence aggregates.
It becomes important, however, if there is more than one firm that is sufficiently
large to influence the market price such a decision made by one firm can influence
the profit of another. This direct interdependency between firms&rsquo; objectives fol-
lows the same logic as the one analyzed in Sect. 6 and can therefore, in principle,
be analyzed with the same toolbox of property rights and transaction costs. A di-
rect interdependency can occur if several firms sell homogenous goods, but also if
they sell differentiated goods that are closely linked (which happens, if cross-price
elasticities between the goods are non-zero).
</p>
<p>The latter situation is, to some extent, always present for a monopolist, but it is
usually left out of the analysis to avoid additional complexities. This chapter will
also neglect the analysis of several monopolists whose profits are interdependent,
because they sell similar products. Instead, it focusses on oligopoly markets in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.1 Introduction 283
</p>
<p>which few sellers supply a homogenous good. The assumption that the goods are
perfect substitutes, from the consumers&rsquo; point of view, simplifies the analysis and
allows it to isolate the pure effect of strategic interdependence.
</p>
<p>The central tool for understanding strategic interdependence is game theory and
the definition of a game and Nash equilibrium will aid in the development of a so-
lution concept. Firms have, in principle, two instruments to maximize profits, if
they are selling a given product. Both instruments are, however, not independent,
because they are linked by the market-demand function. This is why it is irrelevant,
for the monopolist, whether he sets a price and lets quantities adjust passively or
sets a quantity and lets the price adjust passively; both approaches lead to the same
solution. This equivalence is lost in an oligopolistic market. As the following anal-
ysis will show, predictions for the functioning of an oligopoly market with price-
and quantity-setting firms differ sharply. In order to understand the deeper reasons
for this difference, one has to start by building models of price- and quantity-setting
and then see what predictions they make.
</p>
<p>The model of quantity setting is called the Cournot model and the model of
price setting is called the Bertrand model, named after the French mathematicians
Antoine Augustin Cournot, who developed his model as early as 1838, and Joseph
Louis Fran&ccedil;ois Bertrand, who reworked the model by using prices in 1883. It is fas-
cinating that Cournot&rsquo;s analysis anticipated a lot of concepts from economics and
game theory, like supply and demand as functions of prices, the use of graphs to an-
alyze supply and demand, reaction functions and the concept of a Nash equilibrium
(limited to the oligopoly context).
</p>
<p>Digression 37. The Stackelberg Model and the Value of Commitment ˆ
</p>
<p>I can resist everything except temptation. (Oscar Wilde (1892))
</p>
<p>There is a third model of oligopolistic decision making that goes back to
Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg (1934). He returned to Cournot&rsquo;s original
analysis, but assumed that two firms determine their quantities sequentially
instead of simultaneously, as Cournot had assumed. This model will not be
covered in this chapter, but I would like to focus attention on a figure of
thought that emerged from this model and that proved to be of primary im-
portance for economics and other social sciences: the idea of commitment.
</p>
<p>It turns out that the firm that sets its quantity first (the &ldquo;leader&rdquo;) has an
advantage over the other firm (the &ldquo;follower&rdquo;), in comparison to the Cournot
model. However, if this were the case, both firms would like to be the leader
and the factors that determine leadership are not obvious. Both firms would do
whatever they could to be able to choose their strategy first. What is necessary
is the existence of some mechanism or device to be available to one firm, but
not to the other, which allows the firm to make its leadership position credible.
Such a mechanism is called a commitment device.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>284 12 Firm Behavior in OligopolisticMarkets
</p>
<p>The appreciation of the economic role and value of such a device offers an
important new perspective on a number of social phenomena. One can inter-
pret them as reactions to commitment problems. According to Dubner and
Levitt (2005), a commitment device is &ldquo;a means with which to lock yourself
into a course of action that you might not otherwise choose but that produces
a desired result.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The ultimate commitment device can be found in Homer&rsquo;s Odyssey, where
Ulysses puts wax in his men&rsquo;s ears so that they could not hear and had them
tie him to the mast so that he could not jump into the sea, to make sure that
he does not fall prey to the song of the sirens. (Franz Kafka (1931) sees this
as &ldquo;[p]roof that inadequate, even childish measures, may serve to rescue one
from peril.&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>Commitment problems exist on the individual as well as on the social level.
Fitness goals are a good example of an individual commitment problem. Most
people would like to exercise a little more, drink less alcohol or eat health-
ier food. However, if it is time for a run, a friend asks if one is ready for
a second glass of wine, or one has the choice between chocolate cake and
broccoli, one can resist everything other than the temptation to give in. What
would be needed in these situations is a device that forces one to stick to
one&rsquo;s resolutions. Some argue that emotions, like shame and embarrassment,
can be interpreted as such a device: assume that one publicly announces a
fitness goal (&ldquo;I will run the Berlin Marathon next year&rdquo;). If one makes such
a public announcement and fails to stick to one&rsquo;s goals, one&rsquo;s friends will
ridicule one and one will feel ashamed, which helps one&rsquo;s future self perse-
vere. These emotions make deviations from one&rsquo;s plans costly (in this case,
in a purely psychological sense), which is the most important property of a
credible commitment device: if one wants to stick to a savings plan, sign
a long-term contract that is costly to cancel; if one wants to prepare for an
exam, lock oneself into a room without internet access and give the key to a
friend, who will be away for the weekend; and so on.
</p>
<p>The prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma is the main example of a social commitment prob-
lem: both players would profit from a device that makes the cooperative
strategy credible. If the dilemma is used as a metaphor for social interac-
tions in general (a mainstream view since Thomas Hobbes claimed that life
before organized, civil societies was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short),
then the state can be interpreted as one big attempt to make cooperation cred-
ible. This idea can refer to institutions like the rule of law, property rights,
and their enforcement by means of material sanctions and punishments, but
it can also refer to culture in general, where credibility stems from &ldquo;softer&rdquo;
sanctions like feelings of guilt and shame.
</p>
<p>Commitment problems have also been shown to be at the heart of phenom-
ena like inflation and taxation. The phenomenon is also known as the time</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.1 Introduction 285
</p>
<p>inconsistency of decision making. For the case of monetary policy, politicians
have an interest in promising low inflation for the future, in order to control
the expectations of the people. However, once tomorrow comes, increas-
ing inflation can have positive, short-run effects, like increasing employment.
Hence, the announcement of a low-inflation goal may not be credible, if the
government cannot commit to it, leading the economy into a high-inflation
equilibrium. Independent central banks with high degrees of discretion in
monetary policies are widely seen as a commitment device that can solve this
problem. If the central banker&rsquo;s objective is a zero-inflation policy, then tak-
ing away discretion from politicians can, in the end, help them in achieving
their goals. The same is true for taxation. If a government wants to encour-
age investment, then it should announce very low rates of capital taxes but,
once the investments are sunk and the factories are built, the corporations are
locked in and it is rational for the politician to increase taxes again. If this
incentive is anticipated, then firms will not invest in the first place. One of
the reasons why Switzerland is considered an attractive place for investments
is because it managed to establish a reputation for not falling prey to this in-
centive. A lack of such a reputation can be a serious impediment to economic
development.
</p>
<p>The above mentioned firms are &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; with their investments. This
lock-in effect is a widely used business practice that helps firms to make
profits. Software standards are a good example. In order to be able to use
software, one usually has to make large investments of time and effort. These
investments lock one into a standard because, ex-post, after one has made the
investments, the opportunity costs of switching to another standard (called
switching costs) are higher than ex-ante, before one committed to it. This
asymmetry in opportunity costs can be exploited by firms for setting higher
prices for software updates, and so on.
</p>
<p>Evolutionary biologists have used commitment problems to explain the
evolution of moral sentiments, by arguing that the evolution of emotions that
make cooperation rational (not in a material, but in a psychological sense)
have a positive effect for the survival of groups.
</p>
<p>A problem with any credible commitment device is that they reduce flex-
ibility. If the future can be perfectly foreseen, then commitment incurs no
additional costs but, the more uncertain the future becomes, the more risky it
is to constrain one&rsquo;s choices. What would have happened to the epic poem
&ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; if Ulysses, tied to the mast, had drowned because of an unforeseen
storm that hit his ship before he passed the island of the sirens? He would not
be remembered for his brilliance and cunning intelligence, but but for his abil-
ity to drown himself in an attempt to control his virility. That is not exactly
the type of story that would be remembered forever.</p>

<p>286 12 Firm Behavior in OligopolisticMarkets
</p>
<p>12.2 Cournot Duopoly Model
</p>
<p>In the Cournot duopoly model, it is assumed that two profit-maximizing firms, U1
and U2, simultaneously plan the quantities y1 and y2 of a homogenous good that
they want to sell in a given period of time. Quantities are chosen from the set of
positive real numbers (including zero). They produce with a technology that, for
given factor prices, leads to linear or overproportionately increasing cost functions,
C1.y1/ and C2.y2/. Furthermore, there is an inverse demand function, P.y1 C y2/,
that gives the market price for market supply, y1Cy2, (customers see both goods as
perfect substitutes). In order to keep the analysis simple, assume that all firms are
completely informed about all the cost functions and the inverse demand function,
and that all of this is common knowledge.
</p>
<p>If the profits of the firms are denoted by �1 and �2 and can be written as:
</p>
<p>�1.y1; y2/ D P.y1 C y2/ � y1 �C1.y1/; �2.y1; y2/ D P.y1 C y2/ � y2 �C2.y2/:
</p>
<p>From the managers&rsquo; points of view, the problem is that profits depend not only on
the firm&rsquo;s own strategy, but also on the strategy chosen by the other firm, because the
market price is a function of total quantity. In order to solve this problem, assume
that manager 1 (2) expects that the other firm will supply a quantity ye2 (y
</p>
<p>e
1 ). The
</p>
<p>managers determine the optimal quantities given these expectations. The first-order
conditions for the profit-maximizing strategies are:
</p>
<p>@�1.y1; y
e
2/
</p>
<p>@y1
D @P.y1 C y
</p>
<p>e
2 /
</p>
<p>@y1
� y1 C P.y1 C ye2/ � 1
</p>
<p>&bdquo; ƒ&sbquo; &hellip;
</p>
<p>DMR1.y1;ye2 /
</p>
<p>�@C1.y1/
@y1
</p>
<p>D 0
</p>
<p>for firm 1 and
</p>
<p>@�2.y
e
1 ; y2/
</p>
<p>@y2
D @P.y
</p>
<p>e
1 C y2/
@y2
</p>
<p>� y2 C P.ye1 C y2/ � 1
&bdquo; ƒ&sbquo; &hellip;
</p>
<p>DMR2.ye1 ;y2/
</p>
<p>�@C2.y2/
@y2
</p>
<p>D 0
</p>
<p>for firm 2.
Both conditions have a simple economic interpretation: for an expected pro-
</p>
<p>duction level of the competitor, a firm chooses its quantity such that the marginal
revenue of the last unit produced equals the unit&rsquo;s marginal costs. This condi-
tion corresponds to the condition of a non-price discriminating monopolist with
the exception that marginal revenues depend on the expectations of the other firm&rsquo;s
production decision.
</p>
<p>If one solves the first-order conditions for the respective decision variables, y1
and y2, one gets two functions Y1.ye2/ and Y2.y
</p>
<p>e
1/, which determine the optimal
</p>
<p>quantity for one firm for a given expected supply of the other firm. These are the
so-called reaction functions of the two firms.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.2 Cournot Duopoly Model 287
</p>
<p>Points on the reaction functions imply that firms behave optimally for any given
expectation of the other firm&rsquo;s strategy. However, plans do not have to be mutually
consistent. There can be situations where both firms start with expectations, ye2
and ye1 , choose their strategies optimally, but end up with quantities that deviate
from the expectations of the other firm, Y1.y
</p>
<p>e
2 / 6D ye1 or Y2.ye1/ 6D ye2 . In order
</p>
<p>to guarantee consistency, one has to require that expectations and actual behavior
coincide, Y2.Y1.y
</p>
<p>e
2 // D ye2 ^ Y1.Y2.ye1// D ye1 : The best response of firm 2 to
</p>
<p>the best response of firm 1, at an expected quantity of ye2 , is equal to the expected
quantity ye2 , and the best response of firm 1 to the best response of firm 2, at an
expected quantity of ye1 , is equal to the expected quantity y
</p>
<p>e
1 .
</p>
<p>This is another way to say that one is looking for a Nash equilibrium in the
game. Formally, a Nash equilibrium of a Cournot duopoly model is completely
characterized by Y2.Y1.ye2// D ye2 ^ Y1.Y2.ye1 // D ye1 .
</p>
<p>The general characterization of the Nash equilibrium does not contain anything
interesting from an economic point of view, because it is just a formal way to say
that firms follow their objectives rationally and that their behavior is mutually con-
sistent. In order to gain more economic understanding, this chapter will proceed by
assuming that the demand function is linear and that the cost functions are identical
and linear, p.y1 C y2/ D a � b � .y1 C y2/, C1.y1/ D c � y1, C2.y2/ D c � y2 with
a &gt; c &gt; 0 und b &gt; 0. These functional specifications are called the linear model.
A lot of the understanding that one can get from this model carry over to more gen-
eral models with nonlinear functions for either demand or cost, or both. The model
is illustrated in Fig. 12.1. In the figure, y1 C y2 is plotted along the abscissa and
demand, as well as the marginal-cost functions, are plotted along the ordinate. The
marginal-cost function intercepts the ordinate at c; the demand function interrupts
at a and has a slope of �b.
</p>
<p>From a mathematical point of view, there are a lot of different ways to determine
the equilibrium. This subchapter will cover a long and rather complicated way for
the purpose of exercise, by first computing the profit functions (in order to have a
lean notation, one can skip the explicit mention of expected values):
</p>
<p>�1.y1; y2/ D .a�b �.y1Cy2//�y1�c�y1; �2.y1; y2/ D .a�b �.y1Cy2//�y2�c�y2:
</p>
<p>They can be simplified to:
</p>
<p>�1.y1; y2/ D .a�c�b �y2/ �y1�b �y21 ; �2.y1; y2/ D .a�c�b �y1/ �y2�b �y22 :
</p>
<p>The next step is to determine the first-order conditions:
</p>
<p>@�1.y1; y2/
</p>
<p>@y1
D .a � c � b � y2/ � 2 � b � y1 D 0
</p>
<p>and
@�2.y1; y2/
</p>
<p>@y2
D .a � c � b � y1/� 2 � b � y2 D 0:</p>

<p>Fig. 12.1 The linear model
</p>
<p>Firm 1&rsquo;s first-order condition is depicted in the left panel of Fig. 12.2. Marginal
costs are constant at c. Marginal revenues intersect the ordinate at a � b � y2 and
have a slope of �2 � b. They are falling with the supply of the other firm. A
comparison with the monopoly case is illustrative: the marginal revenues of a non-
price-discriminating monopolist have the same slope, �2 � b, but they intersect the
ordinate at a. One can, therefore, think of a Cournot duopolist i as a monopolist
with a &ldquo;curtailed&rdquo; demand function Qa D a � b � yj . If one solves both conditions
for the respective decision parameters, one ends up with the reaction functions:
</p>
<p>Y1.y2/ D
(

(

0 if y1 &gt; .a � c/=b
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>They are illustrated in Fig. 12.2 where y1 is plotted along the abscissa and y2 along
the ordinate. Given that firm 1&rsquo;s reaction function has y2 and firm 2&rsquo;s reaction func-
tion has y1 as explanatory variables, one has to look from the abscissa and ordinate
simultaneously to understand the figure. The &ldquo;flatter&rdquo; graph is firm 2&rsquo;s reaction
function, which has the traditional orientation. The &ldquo;steeper&rdquo; graph is firm 1&rsquo;s re-
action function, which is symmetric to firm 2&rsquo;s, but with the opposite orientation.</p>

<p>The figure reveals the following. (1) Y1.0/ D Y2.0/ D .a � c/=.2 � b/: thus, if
the other firm produces nothing, the remaining duopolist behaves like a monopolist.
(2) The profit-maximizing quantity of a firm falls with an increase in the quantity
of the competitor. (3) The Nash equilibrium is given by the intercection of both
reaction functions. Only at that point are the actual and the expected supplies of the
firms consistent with each other.
</p>
<p>Formally, one can find the Nash equilibrium by inserting the reaction functions
into one another, Y1.y2/ D .a�c�b �y2/=.2�b/ and Y2.y1/ D .a�c�b �y1/=.2�b/.

3 � b
</p>
<p>for the equilibrium market supply.
Compare this solution to the monopoly solution, yM D a�c

<p>2�b , and to the solu-
tion under perfect competition, yPC D a�c
</p>
<p>b
. (One can obtain this number from
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;price equals marginal costs&rdquo;-rule, which implies for the linear model that
a � b � y D c. Solving for y gives the result.) It follows that yM &lt; yCN &lt; yPC ,
which reveals a lot about the effects of competition: comparing a monopoly with a
duopoly and this, in turn, with perfect competition reveals that competition reduces
inefficiency. However, with only two firms, the competitive forces are not strong
enough to enforce the solution under perfect competition. Accordingly, the equilib-
rium price in a duopolistic market lies between the price in a monopolistic market
and the price under perfect competition, because the demand function is monoton-
ically decreasing. The different prices can be determined as markups on marginal</p>

<p>These markups play an important role as &ldquo;rules of thumb&rdquo; in the management lit-
erature, because they allow it to quickly assess the profitability of a market. They
depend on the elasticity of demand, which is, in and of itself, a function based on
the customers&rsquo; tastes and incomes (as reflected in a and b), as well as the competi-
tiveness of the market, expressed by the number of firms. The markup under perfect
competition is zero and it is smaller in a Cournot duopoly than in a monopoly.
</p>
<p>12.3 The Linear Cournot Model with n Firms
</p>
<p>The above analysis suggests that the Cournot model builds a bridge between the
model of non-price-discriminating monopolies and the model of perfect competi-
tion. In order to define this insight more precisely, it makes sense to analyze the
equilibrium of an oligopolistic market with an arbitrary number of firms, to see
how the number of competitors influences the outcome. The following paragraphs
will determine the Nash equilibrium for the linear model with n firms in the market.
For this purpose, some additional notation is needed. Denote the supply of any firm
i by yi and the supply sum of all firms, except for firm i , by y�i . Then, firm i &rsquo;s
profit equation is:
</p>
<p>�i .yi ; y�i / D .a � b � .yi C y�i // � yi � c � yi ; i D 1; : : : ; n:
</p>
<p>Given the quantity supplied by all other firms, firm i&rsquo;s profit-maximizing supply
can be determined by the first-order condition:
</p>
<p>@�i.yi ; y�i /
</p>
<p>@yi
D .a � c � b � y�i /� 2 � b � yi D 0; i D 1; : : : ; n:
</p>
<p>In general, there are n first-order conditions and n unknown variables y1; : : : ; yn. If
one assumes that identical firms behave identically in equilibrium, i.e. for any two
firms i and j yi D yj , one can replace yi with y and y�i with .n � 1/ � y. This
substitution reduces the system of equations to one:
</p>
<p>.a � c � b � .n � 1/ � y/ � 2 � b � y D 0:
</p>
<p>If one solves this equation for y, one obtains the Nash equilibrium quantity of a
representative firm as y� D .a � c/=..n C 1/ � b/. Market supply n � y� is then
given by n=.n C 1/ � .a � c/=b. To understand this result, compare it to the one
under perfect competition, which was determined as .a � c/=b. Then carry out the
comparative-static analysis with respect to n by treating n as a continuous variable
(which it is not, but the assumption facilitates the analysis):
</p>
<p>@y�
</p>
<p>@n
&lt; 0;
</p>
<p>@.n � y�/
@n
</p>
<p>&gt; 0:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.4 The Bertrand Duopoly Model 291
</p>
<p>Two implications follow: first, individual supply is falling due to the number of
firms; the more competitors there are, the less each single firm produces. Second,
market supply is increasing due to the number of competitors. Even though each
single firm produces less, if more competitors are on the market, this effect is over-
compensated by the sheer number of firms. Now let the number of firms become
very large, such that one obtains limn!1 n=.n C 1/ � .a � c/=b D .a � c/=b in
the limit: the market tends towards the equilibrium under perfect competition, if
the number of firms gets very large. The other extreme is a monopolistic market,
(n D 1). In this case, the optimal quantity is .a � c/=.2 � b/: the result from the
monopoly model.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can look at the markup the firms can charge. The equilibrium
price is given by p� D a � b � n � y�, which is equal to p� D c C .a � c/=.nC 1/.
It follows that the markup is decreasing in the number of firms and converges to
zero, if n becomes very large. Hence, the Cournot model provides a theoretical
foundation for the idea that competition drives a market towards efficiency: the
more competitors there are, the smaller the individual firm&rsquo;s influence is on the
outcome of the market. If the number of firms becomes arbitrarily large, then the
influence of a firm completely disappears and it behaves as a price taker and sells
according to the efficient &ldquo;price-equals-marginal-costs&rdquo; rule.
</p>
<p>12.4 The Bertrand Duopoly Model
</p>
<p>In order to see how price- instead of quantity-setting influences the behavior in
such a market, assume that the duopolists choose the prices p1 and p2 instead of
quantities. All other assumptions from the previous model persist and prices are
assumed to be positive, real numbers (including zero). The only exception is that
one directly assumes constant and identical marginal costs for both firms, C1.y1/ D
c � y1; C2.y2/ D c � y2. Price competition with more general cost functions is very
difficult to analyze formally and the fundamental ideas of price competition are
contained in the simplified model.
</p>
<p>The firms&rsquo; profits are analogous to the previous model, but with the exception
that, this time, prices are the strategic variables. Customers are confronted with two
prices and they will choose their preferred firm and their optimal demand accord-
ingly. Hence, x1.p1; p2/ and x2.p1; p2/ are the demand functions relevant for the
two firms, for any given pair of prices p1 and p2. The profit functions become:
</p>
<p>�1.p1; p2/ D p1 � x1.p1; p2/� c � x1.p1; p2/;
�2.p1; p2/ D p2 � x2.p1; p2/� c � x2.p1; p2/:
</p>
<p>Both firms set prices simultaneously and independently. In order to be able to do
so, they have to form expectations about the other firm&rsquo;s price pe1 ; p
</p>
<p>e
2 . A Bertrand-
</p>
<p>Nash equilibrium is a pair of prices, p�1 and p
�
2 , such that both firms maximize
</p>
<p>their profits given price expectations for the other firm, and these expectations are
correct, pe1 D p�1 ; pe2 D p�2 .</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>292 12 Firm Behavior in OligopolisticMarkets
</p>
<p>The maximization problems are non-standard, because the profit functions are
not continuous in prices. Both goods are perfect substitutes from the point of view
of the customers, so they will always buy the cheaper one. Assume that one firm
charges a price that is a little bit higher than the price of the competitor. In that
case, no one will buy from this firm. If the firm lowers the price just a little bit to
undercut its competitor&rsquo;s price, then all customers will change their minds and now
buy from this firm instead. The firm can meet this demand, because it can produce
with constant marginal costs and without any capacity constraint. Hence, demand
is non-continuous at this point.
</p>
<p>An example is two neighboring bakeries that are on the way to work for a num-
ber of people. If one bakery sets a higher price for a croissant than the other bakery,
then no one will buy there (one abstains from queuing or transaction costs of queu-
ing). Hence, demand as a function of both prices can be written as follows. Let
X.pi/; i D 1; 2 be the market demand function:
</p>
<p>x1.p1; p2/ D
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>&lt;
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>X.p1/; p1 &lt; p2
0:5 �X.p1/; p1 D p2
</p>
<p>0 p1 &gt; p2
</p>
<p>;
</p>
<p>x2.p1; p2/ D
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>&lt;
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>X.p2/; p1 &gt; p2
0:5 �X.p2/; p1 D p2
</p>
<p>0 p1 &lt; p2
</p>
<p>;
</p>
<p>using the convention that consumers will be split up equally between the two firms,
if prices are identical.
</p>
<p>The non-continuity of the profit functions implies that one cannot characterize
the best-response functions using partial derivatives of the profit functions. The
non-continuity occurs at p1 D p2 because, at this point, demand switches from
one firm to the other. To characterize best responses, the following paragraphs will
focus on firm 1. A similar argument holds for firm 2, because of the symmetry of
the problem.
</p>
<p>If the purpose is to characterize just one equilibrium, then the task is simple:
start with the conjecture that both firms offer a price that equals marginal costs,
p1 D p2 D c. Market demand splits equally between the firms for this pair of
strategies and both firms make zero profits. If a firm sets a higher price, it loses
the demand and still makes zero profits. If it sets a lower price, it wins over all the
customers, but sells at a price that is lower than its marginal costs, so it incurs losses.
In other words, it cannot improve its profits by deviating to another price, which is
the definition of a Nash equilibrium. Therefore, p�1 D p�2 D c is a Bertrand-Nash
equilibrium.
</p>
<p>It is slightly more complex to prove that the equilibrium is unique. In order
to show uniqueness, start with the scenario in which at least one firm sets a price
below marginal costs. This price leads to losses for at least one firm (the one with
the lower price). This firm can avoid these losses by increasing its price above that
of its competitor. (If both firms set equal prices, the same logic applies.) Now,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.4 The Bertrand Duopoly Model 293
</p>
<p>assume that at least one firm sets a price that is strictly larger than its marginal
costs. If the other firm sets a price below marginal costs, then one is back at the
case analyzed above. Thus, assume that the other firm sets a price above or equal
to its marginal costs. If they are equal to marginal costs, both firms make a profit
of zero, because one of them has no customers and the other is selling at marginal
costs. The firm that is selling at marginal costs can increase its profits by increasing
its price a little bit, making sure that it is above marginal costs, but below the price
of the competitor. If the price is larger than marginal costs, but smaller than the
competitor&rsquo;s price, it wins the whole market and also makes a profit. However, it
is not rational for the competitor to stick to the higher price. He can increase his
profits by slightly undercutting the other price, making sure that it is still above
marginal costs. In this case, he wins over the market, which increases profits from
zero to something strictly positive. Last, but not least, one has to focus on situations
in which both firms set equal prices above marginal costs. In this case, they share
the market equally, making positive profits. Denote the prices by p &gt; c. Formally,
this leads to �1.p; p/ D 0:5 �X.p/ � .p�c/ &gt; 0. What happens if firm 1 deviates to
a price p1 D p��, where � is a small positive number, � &gt; 0; � ! 0? Given that all
customers buy from firm 1 now, profits become �1.p��; p/ D X.p��/�.p���c/.
Given that the firm wins half of the market by this change, there exists an � that is
small enough such that profits go up.
</p>
<p>To summarize, the above line of reasoning has shown that the equilibrium is,
in fact, unique. The model of Bertrand price competition has a stark implication:
price competition drives prices all the way down to marginal costs. This result is
remarkable: even with only two firms, the market behaves as if it were perfectly
competitive. This result has an important implication for competition policy: the
number of firms in a market is, in general, a poor indicator for the functioning of
the market. No conclusive evidence about the intensity of competition can be drawn
from the number of firms alone. Further information about the type of competition
is necessary.
</p>
<p>This result has been derived under very specific assumptions, especially regard-
ing the absence of capacity constraints and identical marginal costs. In order to
figure out how robust the results are, one must start with an analysis of the conse-
quences of different marginal costs, c1 &lt; c2. In this case, setting prices equal to
marginal costs leads to different prices and only the low-cost firm 1 is able to sell
its products. However, it no longer has an incentive to stick to a price that equals
marginal costs, because it can still serve the whole market at higher prices, as long
as it sets a price below firm 2&rsquo;s marginal costs (which define the lower limit for
the price of this other firm). The exact strategy of firm 1 depends on the difference
between both firms&rsquo; marginal costs. Let pM1 be the price that firm 1 would set, if it
had a monopoly.
</p>
<p>� If c2 &gt; pM1 then firm 1 is able to set the monopoly price without being threatened
by firm 2. Due to a sufficiently large cost differential, firm 1 has a de facto
monopoly, even though another firm exists that could enter the market. Firm 1 is
protected against market entries, due to its cost leadership.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>294 12 Firm Behavior in OligopolisticMarkets
</p>
<p>� If c2 &lt; pM1 then firm 1 cannot enforce the monopoly price, because it would
encourage market entry by firm 2. This case is not only interesting because of its
economic implications, but also because it shows a tension between economic
intuition and mathematical modelling, where one has to ask which source is
more trustworthy: one&rsquo;s intuition or the results from the theoretical model. Here
is the problem: intuitively one would expect that the low-cost firm would set the
highest price it can that is still lower than the marginal costs of the competitor,
i.e. p1 D c2 � � with � &gt; 0; � ! 0. Such a price keeps firm 2 out of the
market and is, at the same time, as close to the monopoly price as possible. Such
a strategy does not exist from a mathematical point of view, however, because
the set p1 &lt; c2 is an open set (the boundary p1 D c2 does not belong to it).
Hence, for each price, p1 D c2 � �, there exists a larger price, Qp1 &lt; c2 � 0:5�,
that leads to higher profits, which follows from the denseness of real numbers.
The implication of the denseness of real numbers is that firm 1 has no optimal
strategy, which in turn implies that there is no Nash equilibrium. This result is
highly unsatisfactory, because intuition tells one that this is highly unlikely; that
this problem is merely an artefact of an abstract property of real numbers.
One way to bring intuition in line with the mathematical model is to impose a
certain &ldquo;granularity&rdquo; on the set of admissible prices. If one assumes that prices
are elements of a finely structured set of possible prices (the smallest change in
prices could, for example, be 1/10 of a Rappen), then an equilibrium exists where
firm 1 chooses the highest price lower than the marginal costs of the second firm
(provided that it is higher than its own marginal costs).
If the granularity of prices solves the problem, one may ask why this assumption
was not used right from the beginning. The reason is twofold. First of all, the
necessary notation would be more complex. Second of all, discrete price changes
have unintended side effects of their own. For example, in the case of identical
marginal costs, one would get the potential for multiple equilibria or positive
profits in the equilibrium. These problems illustrate the role mathematics plays
in economics: there is no deeper truth behind the mathematical formalism used
in most theories. Mathematics helps one to understand the logical structure of
arguments: it does no more nor less.
</p>
<p>12.5 Conclusion and Extensions
</p>
<p>The Cournot and the Bertrand models lead to radically different predictions about
the functioning of oligopolistic markets. The natural question then becomes which
model is more adequate to describe oligopolistic behavior. Unfortunately, the an-
swer to this question is not that simple. The Cournot and Bertrand models are only
the tip of the iceberg of models of oligopolistic behavior that have been developed
over the years and that focus on different aspects of firm strategies in such a market
environment. Firms can, for example, also compete in the positioning of their prod-
ucts, technological innovations, marketing or reputation. It depends on the specific
industry, maybe on the exact period of time, as well as on other factors that are hard</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.5 Conclusion and Extensions 295
</p>
<p>to predict, whether a market is more adequately described by quantity or by price
competition. While both models are useful, a meta theory that explains and clarifies
the conditions under which each model is more adequate is still missing.
</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it can be argued that the Bertrand model is useful for the analysis
of price wars. It shows that the results of the model of perfect competition may also
hold in markets with few firms. This has important methodological consequences,
because it implies that the much easier model of perfect competition can also be
used to analyze industries with few competitors, as long as there is evidence that
they engage in price competition.
</p>
<p>The Cournot model is useful for the analysis of firms&rsquo; behavior in less compet-
itive situations. It builds a bridge between the monopoly model and the model of
perfect competition, because it predicts a continuous adjustment from the monopo-
listic to the perfectly competitive equililibrium as the number of firms increases.
</p>
<p>Economists have tried to develop a &ldquo;unified&rdquo; approach to the Cournot/Bertrand
problem. An interesting one is to disentangle the problem of an oligopolist into two
stages. The idea is to assume that a firm&rsquo;s production capacity has to be planned
at a relatively early stage (stage 1) and that the firm is then committed to produce
within the chosen capacity constraint. The production decision (stage 2) takes place
under conditions of price competition. Interestingly, such a two-stage game is able
to predict Bertrand-type price competition in periods of low demand and overcapac-
ity (capacity constraints are not binding). At the same time, the market transforms
into Cournot competition, if capacity constraints are binding. Given that firms try
to avoid overcapacities (they are costly), Cournot competition can therefore be re-
garded as the normal case, if demand is relatively predictable. However, if demand
fluctuates widely over time, there will be periods of Bertrand competition again and
again.
</p>
<p>Independently of whether one is confronted with price or quantity competition,
firms have a strong incentive for coordinated or collusive behavior. The reason is
that the joint industry profits are maximal, if the firms coordinate on the monop-
olistic solution and share the profits equally. To see this assume, on the contrary,
that industry profits would be maximized in the oligopolistic equilibrium. If this
were the case, the monopolist could imitate the oligopolists and choose the Cournot
or Bertrand solution instead. The fact that a profit-maximizing monopolist prefers
another solution shows that he must be better off. Thus, it is in the interest of the
oligopolists to collude and constrain their production in an attempt to move closer
to the monopolistic outcome, which creates a tension between profits and efficiency
of the market. Different strategies are possible to achieve this goal.
</p>
<p>� Firms can try to make explicit price-fixing agreements. However, this is illegal in
most countries, exactly because it would make the market less efficient. Hence,
firms have developed more subtle strategies to coordinate their outputs.
</p>
<p>� One way of reducing competition is through a merger or an acquisition (M&amp;A).
These measures usually have to be approved by the national or supranational
competition authorities. However, even if M&amp;As are not an option, in practice it</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>296 12 Firm Behavior in OligopolisticMarkets
</p>
<p>is sometimes possible to gain control over some other firm&rsquo;s strategies by com-
plicated cross-ownership or holding structures.
</p>
<p>� It is also possible to reach implicit agreements on prices or quantities that fly
below the radar of the competition authorities. These agreements are relatively
easy to achieve, because of the limited number of firms that all operate in the
same industry but, at the same time, difficult to enforce. However, enforcement
is crucial, because every single firm has an incentive to break the agreement and
sell a little more at a lower price. The reason is that the monopoly solution is not
a Nash equilibrium, so every single firm can profit from unilaterally deviating
from a non-equilibrium strategy. Coordination in an oligopolistic market has the
structure of a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. A way out of this dilemma opens, if firms
compete repeatedly. If firms compete not only today, but also in the future, then
trust can build and they can, in principle, punish deviations from cooperative
behavior over time. The exact conditions under which cooperation can be stabi-
lized, by repeated interactions, are complicated to characterize, but an important
factor is how forward-looking firms are. If they focus heavily on the present,
then future gains and losses are of only secondary importance, which makes the
enforcement of cooperative behavior difficult.
</p>
<p>Digression 38. The Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma and Frames of Reference
</p>
<p>From the point of view of the competing firms, Cournot and Bertrand equi-
libria have the character of the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma: both firms could be better
off by coordinating on the monopoly solution, but individual rationality leads
them to a different outcome.
</p>
<p>At this point, one could argue that, as with the prisoners in their interro-
gation rooms, this solution is no dilemma at all, because the general public
profits from the inability of the firms or prisoners to cooperate. The prisoners
are guilty and end up in jail and the outcome of oligopolistic competition is
closer to the Pareto optimum than the monopolistic one is.
</p>
<p>What this discussion shows is that the perception of a problem depends on
the frame of reference. Oligopolistic competition is a cooperation problem
from the point of view of the firms, but not from the point of view of society.
On the contrary, society can make use of the dilemma structure between the
firms to make markets more efficient.
</p>
<p>Thus, the existence of a cooperation problem does not automatically imply
that society should do something about it. It depends on the frame of reference
(the most adequate one from a normative perspective), whether a cooperation
problem is perceived as a vice or as a virtue.
</p>
<p>Empirical industry studies usually identify many factors that influence market
behavior, but that change rather frequently, which makes it very difficult to empiri-
cally identify and control, ceteris paribus, experiments to test the theory. One way
out of this dilemma is to test the theories in the lab by means of market experiments.</p>

<p>Fig. 12.3 Experimental results about collusion and the intensity of competition
</p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is that the researcher can control a lot of the rele-
vant factors by the design of the experiment. However, the validity of experiments
is limited, because participants are aware that they are not in real markets, but in the
lab. There is an extensive debate about the so called external validity of experiments
that this chapter will not cover. Instead, this subchapter will briefly summarize the
main findings from the literature on experimental oligopoly theory.
</p>
<p>In experiments about Cournot quantity competition studies find a lot of support
for the predictions of the model, if the experiment is run for a single round and
subjects are anonymous and cannot communicate with each other. Repeated in-
teraction and the possibility to communicate reduces the intensity of competition
and collusive behavior becomes more likely. However, collusion is fragile and de-
pends on the number of firms (players) in the experiment. In a duopoly, collusive
behavior can be frequently observed, but it breaks down quickly, if the number of
players increases. With four firms (players), the intensity of competition is gener-
ally higher in experiments than is predicted by the theory and the solution converges
very quickly to the competitive equilibrium. Figure 12.3, which is taken from Huck,
S., Normann, H.T., Oechssler, J., 2004, illustrates this result.
</p>
<p>The number of firms, or players, is denoted on the abscissa, and average quan-
tities are displayed along the ordinate. The experiment ran for 25 rounds. The left
bar shows the average production levels over all rounds. The middle bar depicts
the average production levels over the last nine rounds. The right bar gives the the-
oretical prediction of the Cournot model. One finds the pattern described above:
with only two firms, production is lower than theoretically predicted, which points
towards some form of implicit collusion. The incentive for collusive behavior is,
however, more limited towards the end of the experiment, which supports the idea
that cooperative behavior is supported by repeated interactions because, the closer
one gets to the end, the less credible future punishments become. A second result
of the experiment is that total production increases in the number of firms.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>298 12 Firm Behavior in OligopolisticMarkets
</p>
<p>The Bertrand model has also been experimentally tested. Dufwenberg and
Gneezy (2000) found that the experimental findings are in line with the theoretical
predictions, if the number of firms is three or larger. With only two firms and re-
peated interactions (in which pairs of players are randomly matched in each round
to make sure that the above-mentioned punishment mechanisms cannot work), the
authors found that prices are consistent with the theoretical predictions during the
first rounds, but increase later on in the experiment. Apparently, the realization
of the bitter truth that the &ldquo;price-equals-marginal-costs&rdquo; rule leads to zero profits
made the players creative in findings ways to implicitly collude. This seems to
be possible in duopolistic situations, even if players are randomly matched but, as
soon as the number of players exceeds two, it apparently becomes too complicated
to figure out collusive strategies.
</p>
<p>Digression 39. The ThreeC s of Economics✍
</p>
<p>Chapter 11 explains that games can be interpreted as structural metaphors
that allow one to gain insight into the logic of individual decision making
and collective outcomes. It asserts that society has to overcome two types of
challenges, if it wants to alleviate scarcity, cooperation problems and coor-
dination problems. At the beginning of this chapter, the argument is brought
that a third type of problem exists: commitment. Commitment problems lie at
the heart of the solution to cooperation, as do coordination problems. To see
why, take a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma as an example. In this cooperation problem,
players would like to mutually coordinate on the the cooperative strategy, but
individual rationality makes cooperation not credible. Hence, what is missing
is a commitment device that allows them to overcome the credibility problem.
Coordination problems have a different logic, but commitment mechanisms
play a crucial role, as well. If all players could publicly commit to a specific
strategy, the equilibrium-selection problem would be solved.
</p>
<p>Hence, coordination, cooperation and commitment problems define the
structural landscape of economics. This is why they can be called the three
C s of economics.
</p>
<p>Such a structural approach to economics has two main advantages:
</p>
<p>� First, the simplicity of the the three C s approach gives one a frame of ref-
erence for the interpretation and understanding of societal problems. Is
it a coordination problem or a cooperation problem? What kind of com-
mitment device might help to overcome it? Additionally, if there is no
problem, then what kind of commitment mechanism is in the background
that helps in stabilizing the efficient outcome?
Here are two examples that illustrate this approach: Chapter 10 demon-
strated that externalities can be interpreted as unresolved cooperation
problems. Hence, the next step is to think about commitment mechanisms
that help in internalizing them. On the other hand, previous chapters have</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.5 Conclusion and Extensions 299
</p>
<p>argued that a complete set of competitive markets leads to efficiency under
certain assumptions. The commitment device in the background is a sys-
tem of perfectly enforced property rights. But is this the end of the story?
Who enforces the property rights and is it in the interest of this person to
do so? Does one have to dig deeper to identify commitment mechanisms
for law enforcers? etc.
</p>
<p>� Second, the three C s are a tool for future studies. When one begins to
study more elaborate and advanced economic theories, it is easy to lose
track of the basic story underlying the theory. Yet most, if not all, theories
are variations of coordination or cooperation problems, plus some more
or less elaborate ideas on commitment. Approaching these theories with
a three-C s perspective helps one to make sense of them. It also helps
one to scrutinize the basic ideas of these theories. Is the problem at hand
adequately described as a coordination or cooperation problem? Are the
institutions the theory focuses upon convincing, in the sense that they are
credible commitment devices and, if not, why?

<p>13.1 The Grounding of Swissair as a Case Study for the Use of
Economic Theory
</p>
<p>Swissair&rsquo;s collapse this week stranded thousands of passengers world-wide; saw its planes
blocked in London; and left fliers holding potentially worthless tickets. A widespread
feeling in Switzerland is that the airline that was the national pride was finished off by
the banks that embody its national character of reliable, no-nonsense business. Yet its
undoing may have been something very un-Swiss: bad management. [. . . ] The plunge in
air traffic after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. pushed Swissair over the edge, but
it has been flirting with collapse for months. [. . . ] The nightmare began as a grand plan for
growth. Like scores of other companies from this small, land-locked country, Swissair grew
into a global player. &lsquo;An inflexible regulatory environment and some poor investments&rsquo;
crippled Swissair, says Damien Horth, an airline analyst at ABN-Amro in London. &lsquo;Poor
management by Swissair in terms of its acquisitions and not controlling its associates well&rsquo;
proved fatal. (The Wall Street Journal, October 02, 2001)

<p>We have covered a lot of ground in the last chapters and one should, by now, have
a decent understanding of the functioning of prototypical markets, how they con-
tribute to welfare and their weaknesses. We have also devoted a lot of pages putting
the theories into perspective and applying them toward getting a better understand-
ing of the societal phenomena that are characteristic for today&rsquo;s societies. The case

<p>304 13 A Case Study
</p>
<p>studies have been relatively short, however, and have been tailored to specific the-
ories, or even to specific aspects of a theory. What is still missing is a case study
of sufficient complexity that it allows one to bring different theories together and
to discuss the adequacy of the different theories for gaining an understanding of
complex economic and social issues.
</p>
<p>This chapter is an attempt at filling this gap and at illustrating how economic the-
ories can be used to analyze and to better understand developments in markets and
industries. The case that I am analyzing is the spectacular grounding of Swissair, a
former Swiss airline. In order to be able to do so, one has to combine insights from
different chapters. As one will see, a narrow economic focus is not sufficient to get
a grip on this case. Rather, one has to embed economic analysis into the integrative
approach that is fostered in this book, in order to gain a better understanding of the
different factors that contributed to the insolvency of this once proud airline. One
will see that legal, political, managerial and cultural aspects played important roles
in this case. However, this analysis will also mention the limitations of the theoret-
ical framework that has been developed in this book. Some aspects of the aviation
industry require more elaborate market models, and I will briefly show how one
can use the theories presented in this book to address these issues and to develop
the theories in the directions necessary to understand these more complex aspects.
</p>
<p>The market structure of an industry reflects the technology of production, the size
of the market, as well as the legal and regulatory framework in which the firms oper-
ate. Changes in any of these factors can trigger deep, structural changes that impact
on the number of competitors in a market, as well as the way competition works.
Some of the reasons for the grounding of Swissair cannot be understood, if one
does not take these factors into consideration. In the following pages, I will briefly
summarize the most important theoretical insights from the preceding chapters that
are relevant for a better understanding of the airline industry and apply them to the
Swissair case. They provide one with a toolkit that allows one to better understand
some of the key factors that determine the functioning of the airline industry. If one
is still familiar with them, one can skip this subchapter. However, there are some
additional properties of the industry that have to be taken into consideration for a
comprehensive understanding, which require more advanced theories and therefore
have to be left out of consideration. The main purpose of the following case study
is, therefore, twofold:
</p>
<p>1. It should help one to see how economic theories can be used in order to better
understand real-world phenomena, how to select the most adequate theories, and
how to use one&rsquo;s insights to gain an understanding of the case. The fact that one
has to conduct a thought experiment under &ldquo;laboratory conditions,&rdquo; which leave
out some important aspects of the problem, does not compromise this approach,
but instead creates a relatively accessible foundation. Hence, one is not aiming
to present a &ldquo;full-scaled&rdquo; report on the case, but rather a version that allows
one to apply and restrict one&rsquo;s attention to the theories that one has learned
throughout the previous chapters.</p>

<p>13.2 Some Facts About the Aviation Industry in Europe 305

<p>2. It illustrates how economics, law and management can and should work hand
in hand to better understand the logic of social phenomena. In the end, good
political and managerial decisions become more likely, if they are built on such
an integrative approach.
</p>
<p>13.2 Some Facts About the Aviation Industry in Europe
</p>
<p>On March 31, 2002, after 71 years of service, Swissair ceased operation. This was
the official endpoint of an economic downturn that led a once major international
airline into bankruptcy. The airline prospered well into the 1980s, when it was one
of the five major airlines in Europe. It was known as the "Flying Bank," due to its
financial stability, and it was considered a national icon in Switzerland. How is it
possible that a &ldquo;Flying Bank&rdquo; can turn into a money burner within 20 years? Which
factors contributed to the demise of this airline?
</p>
<p>A major event like the grounding of an airline can never be traced back to only a
few causal factors. Reality is messy and one should shy away from oversimplifica-
tions. An economic analysis of the European aviation industry sheds at least some
light on the case and makes some of the aspects that contributed to the grounding
more transparent. However, an economic analysis of the case only gets one so far.
In the end, the interplay between legal, technological and institutional factors cre-
ated an environment in which managers had to act and define strategies for their
firms. This environment may have been relatively hostile towards an airline like
Swissair, but there is no direct causal chain from the changing economic logic of
the industry to the demise of Swissair.
</p>
<p>After World War 2, air traffic increased rapidly and many airlines profited from
the political regulation of the markets that created national, de-facto, monopolies.
During the 1960ies and 1970ies, Swissair was considered one of the best airlines
of the world and made huge profits. Things began to change in the 1980ies when
the European Community started a process of liberalization of the community air
transport market, to which the member states committed themselves in 1986, and
that also became relevant for Switzerland. In order to create a single market for air
transport, the EU liberalized its air transport sector in three stages, called &ldquo;pack-
ages.&rdquo; This process culminated in the third package, adopted in 1993 and extended
in 1997. It introduced the freedom for any airline of a member state to provide ser-
vices within the EU and the freedom to provide &ldquo;cabotage,&rdquo; the right for an airline
of one member state to operate a route within another member state. This single
market was extended to Norway, Iceland and Switzerland in the following years.
</p>
<p>This process of liberalization gradually changed the market structure from a sys-
tem of regionally partitioned monopolies into a system of interregional competition,
leading to a period of &ldquo;cutthroat&rdquo; competition in a market with too many, too small
airlines, i.e. a form of competition where it is clear that some firms will be forced to
leave the market. The following analysis will show that it was clear from the onset
that this change in the political regulation of the industry would eventually lead to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>306 13 A Case Study
</p>
<p>a consolidation and concentration of airlines. Different airlines began from differ-
ent starting positions in this process of predatory competition. The &ldquo;Flying Bank&rdquo;
Swissair had a head start, because of its large asset holdings and huge liquidity.
However, the fact that Switzerland rejected taking part in the European Economic
Area in 1992 was a huge disservice to Swissair, because the emerging common air-
line market was, for that reason, not a level playing field. Here are a few examples
of the obstacles that confronted them: Swissair planes were not allowed to take
up passengers during intermediate landings in EEA countries and Swissair was not
allowed to sell tickets for sections within EEA member countries.
</p>
<p>13.3 Applying Economic Theory to Understand the Aviation
Industry
</p>
<p>Now, one can lay down some principles that govern optimal firm behavior in a
monopolized aviation industry. One should focus one&rsquo;s attention on two different
technological characteristics that are of major importance: the technology-induced
cost structure of an airline and the bundling problem that results from the network
structure of the product. These factors influence the pricing strategies of the airlines
and, thereby, its profits. The network of flights offered by an airline determines
its portfolio of different products, which implies that all airlines offer a different
product portfolio, even if there may be some routes for which they compete directly.
</p>
<p>Digression 40. Additional Aspects
</p>
<p>This analysis gives only a very broad concept about airline pricing. There are
at least three additional aspects in reality that complicate pricing, but that also
make pricing in this industry intellectually fascinating. (1) There is no spot
market for flights, so demand for a specific flight drops more or less stochas-
tically over time before the flight. This implies that there is no single price
on such a &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; market, but a time-dependent price function. Prices
may vary over time, depending on load factors, and so on. (2) Each flight
has a given capacity, which implies that the marginal costs of an additional
passenger are very small before and very large after the capacity threshold is
reached (one would have to change the aircraft). Hence, any cost-plus pricing
rule would discriminate prices at this point. The resulting problem is known
as peak-load pricing in the literature. (3) An airline offers a network of dif-
ferent connections, which implies that there are complementary, as well as
substitutive, edges in each network and airlines also compete with respect to
their network structures.
</p>
<p>In order to be able to analyze the effect of liberalization on the industry, remem-
ber that the model of oligopolistic quantity setting (Cournot competition) includes
the case of perfect competition (and thereby also Bertrand Competition) as a spe-</p>

</p>
<p>cial case, with a perfectly elastic demand function. Hence, one can restrict one&rsquo;s
attention to a short repetition of this model in order to be able to distill the main
messages for the Swissair case.
</p>
<p>13.3.1 Costs
</p>
<p>Chapter 7 explained that a firm&rsquo;s total costs, C.y/, are the sum of fixed costs, FC ,
and variable costs, VC.y/, the last of which depend on the quantity produced, y.
In the airline context, y may be, for example, the number of passengers transported
from A to B or the frequency of flights offered. Hence, one can describe the total
costs as:
</p>
<p>C.y/ D VC.y/C FC:
</p>
<p>One important characteristic of the aviation industry is the structure of the airlines&rsquo;
cost functions: fixed costs are a significant share of total costs because the logistic
infrastructure is, at least in the short run, largely independent of the occupancy rate.
Fixed costs do not influence the pricing policy of a firm, but are relevant for profits
and for determining whether a firm stays in a market or has to exit it.
</p>
<p>Fixed costs are, to a large degree, capacity costs: that is, the depreciation and
financing costs of the aircraft fleet and its maintenance, the costs of the supporting
infrastructure, as well as the costs of landing rights and the handling of passengers
at airports (contracts are usually longer term).
</p>
<p>An airline&rsquo;s variable costs, for a given flight, encompass gasoline, onboard ser-
vices like free drinks and meals (if they exist), and so on. If one breaks down costs
to a single passenger, not even gasoline costs are variable. Hence, depending on the
level of aggregation, variable costs are relatively unimportant in this industry. This
leads to the following observation: average total costs of a firm are:
</p>
<p>AC.y/ D C.y/
y
</p>
<p>D VC.y/
y
</p>
<p>C FC
y
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>Average costs are decreasing over a given range when y is small and, depending on
the structure of the variable costs, they might even be decreasing for all y. In order
to see this, note that VC.0/ D 0 by definition. Because fixed costs are large, average
costs decrease over a significant range of y and decrease over the whole range (for
all y), if marginal costs are constant or decreasing. Assume, for simplicity, that
variable costs are linear,
</p>
<p>VC.y/ D c � y; c &gt; 0;
</p>
<p>which implies that marginal costs are constant and equal to c. Hence, the average-
costs function is:
</p>
<p>AC.y/ D c C FC
y
</p>
<p>:</p>

<p>Average costs decrease strictly for all y and converge to c as y grows large, because
AC 0.y/ D �FC=.y2/ &lt; 0 and limAC.y/jy!1 D c. In Fig. 13.1, one can see this
relationship in the special case of FC D 10 and c D 1.
</p>
<p>What are the implications of this type of cost structure for the functioning of the
industry? First, a single firm can operate a given network more efficiently than two
competing firms can that share the market:
</p>
<p>C.y/ D FC C c � y &lt; 2 � C.y=2/ D 2
�
</p>
<p>FC C 1
2
� y
�
</p>
<p>D 2 � FC C c � y:
</p>
<p>There are size effects, because an increase in output decreases average costs. Be-
cause of this property, industries like the aviation industry have a tendency for
concentration, because fixed costs limit the number of competitors that can prof-
itably operate in the market. However, it indicates that the number of firms, for
which this is the case, is rather limited. Hence, starting from a situation with a
large number of protected airlines, it is very likely the case that competition leads
to concentration; some airlines will not be able to survive the process of market
liberalization, as soon as they start to compete on some segments of the networks.
Airlines were forced to play musical chairs when the European Community decided
to liberalize the market. However, to the extent that average costs are downward
sloping, the process of market concentration is potentially efficiency-enhancing,
because it reduces the total costs of production.
</p>
<p>13.3.2 The Linear Cournot Model with n Firms
</p>
<p>In the following subchapter, assume that the effect of an increase in competition
can be captured by the Cournot model of oligopolistic competition. Taken liter-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.3 Applying economic theory 309
</p>
<p>ally, the model could only be applied to flights for which airlines directly compete
(e.g. Zurich &ndash; Frankfurt), because the products have to be perfect substitutes. The
assumption of Cournot competition is, however, innocuous insofar as that the qual-
itative results do not depend on this specific market model. The assumption of
monopolistic or Bertrand competition would lead to similar conclusions. Also,
more elaborate pricing strategies, or more complicated models of network com-
petition, with imperfect substitutability, would also leave the qualitative results
unchanged. If the qualitative results are robust in this sense one can &ndash; remem-
ber the epistemic status of positive theories that was discussed in Chap. 1 &ndash; go for a
simple model.
</p>
<p>In order to be able to understand the effects of competition, one can determine
the Nash equilibrium for a linear Cournot model, with n airlines that compete in
(some segment of) the market. I follow the notation from Chap. 12. (If one is still
familiar with the n-firm model from Chap. 12, then one can skip the derivation of
the Nash equilibrium and jump immediately to the conclusions.)
</p>
<p>Assume, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake, that the demand for the services of a given airline
is linear and has the following form:
</p>
<p>p D a � b � Y;
</p>
<p>where Y is market supply, a &gt; c denotes the maximal willingness to pay in the
market and b quantifies how price-sensitive the market is. Denote by yi , the supply
of a single airline i , and by y�i , the supply sum of all airlines except i . Then, airline
i &rsquo;s profit equation is:
</p>
<p>�i.yi ; y�i / D .a � b � .yi C y�i // � yi � c � yi � FC; i D 1; : : : ; n:
</p>
<p>Given the quantity supplied by all other firms, firm i &rsquo;s profit-maximizing supply
can be determined by the first-order condition, which establishes the well-known
&ldquo;marginal-revenues-equals-marginal-costs&rdquo; rule:
</p>
<p>@�i.yi ; y�i /
</p>
<p>@yi
D .a � c � b � y�i /� 2 � b � yi D 0; i D 1; : : : ; n:
</p>
<p>A single airline, i , behaves like a monopolist on a &ldquo;curtailed&rdquo; market with a market-
demand function of p D a0 � b � yi , where a0 D a � b � y�i . Figure 13.2 depicts
this situation for a curtailed demand function, p D 11 � y, and cost function,
C.y/ D y C 10. In this situation, the airline&rsquo;s optimal output is yM D 5, with a
corresponding price of pM D 6. Per-unit profit would be pM �AC.yM / D 6�3 D
3 &gt; 0. (Remember that this result need not be a Nash equilibrium: declaring it as
such would require specifying all the parameters to make sure that all the other
airlines are on their reaction functions, as well.)
</p>
<p>This formulation reveals that the relevant demand function for a single airline,
p D a0 � b � yi , depends on the total quantity supplied by all other airlines, which
captures the effect of competition in this model: an increase in y�i shifts the cur-
tailed demand function inwards; an increase in the total supply of the competitors</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 13.2 The airline&rsquo;s optimal policy for a given curtailed demand function
</p>
<p>has the same consequences as a reduction in the demand for aviation services does.
In the example displayed in the figure, the price is above average costs, which im-
plies that the airline makes positive profits. If competition has the effect of shifting
the curtailed demand function inwards, it is easy to see that there is a point at which
price equals average costs, such that the airline can no longer operate profitably.
This is the point at which the airline is forced out of the market, if it cannot cut
costs or make its services more attractive to the customer.
</p>
<p>If one assumes that all other airlines supply the same quantity, y�i D .n �
1/y, it becomes apparent that this downward shift in the curtailed demand function
may be a result of an increase in the quantity supplied by the competitors, holding
the number of competitors constant, or the result of new airlines competing in the
market. The model, therefore, makes very sharp predictions about the effect of
market liberalization on a single airline: as soon as new airlines start to compete
with the formerly monopolistic network of, for example, Swissair, this increase in
competition &ldquo;steals&rdquo; part of the demand from Swissair, which eventually reduces
profits to zero. How long it takes before an airline starts making losses depends on
its fixed and variable costs.
</p>
<p>In order to derive more detailed results, one has to solve for the Nash equilib-
rium. In general, the first-order conditions specify a system of n equations and n
unknowns, y1; : : : ; yn. If one assumes that identical firms behave identical in equi-
librium so that, for any two firms i and j , yi D yj holds, one can replace yi with y
and y�i by .n � 1/ � y. One ends up with one equation and one unknown variable:
</p>
<p>.a � c � b � .n � 1/ � y/ � 2 � b � y D 0:</p>

<p>Fig. 13.3 Prices and demand after market entry
</p>
<p>If one solves this equation for y, one obtains the equilibrium quantity of a firm as
y� D .a � c/=..nC 1/ � b/ and market supply n � y� is n=.nC 1/ � .a � c/=b. One
can also derive the market price, as well as the airline&rsquo;s profits:

nC 1 ; (13.1)
</p>
<p>�� D .a � c/
2
</p>
<p>.nC 1/2b � FC: (13.2)
</p>
<p>These findings allow a more detailed analysis of the effect of competition (which
one can interpret as an increase in the number of competitors n in the market). First,
looking at equilibrium prices, one finds that @p�=@n &lt; 0: an increase in competition
brings prices down and, given that demand and prices are inversely related, leads to
an increase in total demand.
</p>
<p>Reliable data for this effect exists for the US-market. Figure 13.3 demonstrates
the potential empirical magnitude of this effect for a single route, the Baltimore
(BWI) to Albany (ALB) market for the 1992-2001 period. The entry of South-
west Airlines into the market decreased the average fare by 61%, causing passenger
demand to increase by 641%.
</p>
<p>The downward pressure on prices, which is caused by competition is, in and
of itself, no problem; on the contrary, it can be argued that it makes the market
more efficient, because it brings the equilibrium closer to a Pareto-efficient alloca-</p>

</p>
<p>tion. However, a look at profits reveals that competitive pressure can lead to deeper
structural changes in the market. The first term in the profit condition is revenues
minus variable costs. It defines the gross margin that an airline can use to cover its
fixed costs. This gross margin decreases as the number of competitors increases,
which implies that a number of competitors exists, due to which airlines start to
make losses. Denote this number by Nn. It can be determined from (13.3) by setting
profits equal to zero:
</p>
<p>�� D .a � c/
2
</p>
<p>. NnC 1/2 � b � FC D 0 , Nn D
a � cp
b � FC
</p>
<p>� 1: (13.3)
</p>
<p>If, for example, b D 1; c D 1; a D 2001 and FC D 1:000:000, then the maximum
number of firms that can exist without taking losses is Nn D 2. Of course, given that
market liberalization heats up competition and competition brings down profits, the
maximum number of airlines that can survive in a regulated, quasi-monopolized
market exceeds the number of airlines that can survive on a liberalized market.
Hence, if the number of airlines that operate in the regulated market, On, exceeds Nn,
then cutthroat competition sets in. This was exactly the situation European airlines
were confronted with at the beginning of market liberalization.
</p>
<p>If cutthroat competition is the effect of market liberalization, one may ask why
airlines were willing to enter new, formerly protected markets. The answer to
this question follows the logic of Cournot competition and the market-entry game.
Assume that an airline does not offer a direct flight from A to B before market lib-
eralization and that it considers opening this route. The incumbent had a monopoly
before liberalization and will suffer from market entry. However, even if total mar-
ket profits fall after market entry, because of competition, it is still profitable to
enter, as long as profits are positive. The fact that the incumbent is worse off is
irrelevant for the entry decision (one is facing a cooperation problem).
</p>
<p>It could also be argued that the picture painted above is incomplete, because an
airline like Swissair could compensate the loss in profits in its formerly protected
markets (routes) by entering other markets (routes); competition is not a one-way
street. In order to see why this logic is flawed, one has to remember that monopoly
profits exceed the sum of oligopoly profits in a market. Hence, if two former mo-
nopolists on markets A and B start competing with each other on both markets,
total profits are reduced. Therefore, the additional profits from entering new mar-
kets cannot compensate the loss in profits in one&rsquo;s former monopoly market. The
only case where it is, theoretically, possible that an airline can increase its total
profits is a situation with asymmetric competition, where the airline enters more
new markets that there are competitors entering its formerly monopolized market.
(In this example, this effect would trivially occur, if the airline operating market B
decides not to enter market A, but the airline operating market A enters market B.)
As this chapter already suggested, Swissair was not able to compete on a par with
other European airlines because it did not belong to the EEA. Hence, it was much
more difficult for Swissair to compensate for losses in the home market by entering
new ones than it was for its competitors from the EEA.</p>
<p/>

<p>13.3 Applying economic theory 313
</p>
<p>The managers of the airlines could have known that market competition would
eventually lead to market concentration by either insolvencies of some carriers,
mergers and acquisitions, or strategic alliances. What was not clear from the outset,
however, was whether Swissair would be among those airlines that survived this
process, despite its handicap.
</p>
<p>13.3.3 Extension: Network Choice, Acquisitions, and Strategic
Alliances
</p>
<p>The effect of market liberalization was, of course, that airlines started to operate
flights on routes that had previously been monopolized. Any new route has an
effect on the network structure of an airline and this network structure is such an
important factor for an understanding of the functioning of the market that one has
to devote some time and energy to this fact so that one can fully appreciate it. In
order to do so, one can use the models in the toolbox gained from previous chapters
as heuristics so one can develop an understanding of more complex technological
and market structures.
</p>
<p>Its network structure is an important element for the success of an airline. An air-
line&rsquo;s network is the collection of routes or connections that it offers. This network
structure is important for at least two reasons. First, it is an important determinant
of the airline&rsquo;s total costs. Depending on the size and structure of the network, costs
may differ and it is, therefore, of great importance to develop and structure the net-
work efficiently. Second, the size and structure of the network influences demand,
because it influences the potential customer&rsquo;s willingness to pay.
</p>
<p>The second argument can be illustrated by means of the following example. As-
sume an airline offers a flight between two cities, A and B , and considers extending
its network by offering a new connection between cities B and C . The first effect
is, of course, that this new flight creates demand from those passengers who want
to travel from B to C . However, there is a second, indirect effect, because the new
connection creates additional demand by those passengers who want to travel from
A to C , who can now be served by this airline. Hence, from the airline&rsquo;s point of
view, the value of network A � B � C exceeds the sum of values of sub-networks
A � B and B � C , which is a simple form of a positive network effect. The fact
that network effects imply that the total is more than the sum of its parts has im-
plications for the optimal network structure, from the point of view of the demand
side: the network should be extended by including additional routes, if the addi-
tional revenues from an additional route (including network externalities) exceed
the additional costs (airport charges, direct operating costs of the flight, etc.).
</p>
<p>The first, cost-saving argument can be illustrated by the same three-cities model
with cities A, B , and C . Assume that, for given prices m, passengers want to travel
from any city to either of the others (A to B , B to A, A to C , C to A, B to C , and
C to B). An airline has, basically, two options at its disposal. The first is to offer
the full set of connections (FCN , fully connected network): that is, to offer the
capacity to accommodate demand for each route. The second is to use one of the</p>

<p>cities, say A, as a hub that is connected to both other cities, but to not connect the
others directly with each other. Passengers who want to fly from B to C , or vice
versa, need to fly via A. This structure is called a hub-and-spoke (HSN ) network.
Figure 13.4 shows the two network types and the corresponding traffic flows on
each route.
</p>
<p>In order to illustrate how network structures influence costs, I introduce a simpli-
fied model that illustrates how network structure influences an airline&rsquo;s costs. For
simplicity, the study only encompasses a single airline, but the general message
remains valid in a competitive environment. The tree different routes are denoted
by AB , BC and CA. Demand is 2 � m for each route, m for each direction. The
airline&rsquo;s total costs are a function of the number of routes it operates and of the
number of passengers on each route. There are fixed costs for operating a route, F ,
and variable costs on each route, i , are a function of the total number of passengers,
k, transported on that route times marginal costs, c, so:
</p>
<p>VCi .ki / D c � k˛i :
</p>
<p>where ˛ � 1 is a parameter that determines whether marginal cost increase (˛ &gt; 1)
or are constant (˛ D 1). Note that k is not necessarily equal to 2 � m because, if
the HS-network is chosen, nobody flies on BC , but all the BC passengers have to
take a detour via A, and analogously for all passengers who want to go from C to
B . In that case, kAB D kCA D 4 �m. If the airline offers a fully connected network,
ki D 2 �m, then total costs are

</p>
<p>In the case of constant marginal costs, ˛ D 1, the above condition simplifies to
</p>
<p>m &lt; FC=.2c/:
</p>
<p>Hence, the relationship between the demand for a given route and the fixed-to-
variable-costs ratio is crucial for the optimality of a network structure. Large fixed
costs make it, ceteris paribus, more likely that a HSN is more cost efficient. This
relation is depicted in Fig. 13.5.
</p>
<p>Cost efficiency, however, is not the only factor an airline has to take into con-
sideration when it optimizes its network for a given set of possible connections.
From the point of view of a customer, it may make a difference whether she flies
directly from Zurich to Copenhagen or whether she has to change planes in Frank-
furt. Usually, the willingness to pay is lower in the latter case. The optimal network
structure, therefore, reflects an optimal compromise between cost efficiency and the
willingness to pay.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>316 13 A Case Study
</p>
<p>At the point in time at which the European market started to liberalize, experi-
ence from the liberalization of the US market (which went through a similar process
more than a decade earlier) already suggested that a HSN is superior to a FCN and
most European airlines adopted a HSN structure (Air France with a hub in Paris,
Lufthansa with a hub in Frankfurt, KLM with a hub in Amsterdam,. . . ). Swissair,
however, resisted that trend and maintained three, large-scale airports in Zurich,
Basel and Geneva. In fact, Swissair operated a network that was neither purely
FCN nor HSN but, given the size of the Swiss market, it was closer to a FCN .
While this decentralized structure did not really make the available network more
attractive for travellers, because the geographic distance between the three cities is
negligible by international standards and the local market is too small to justify such
a network, it was (and is) costly to maintain. The additional costs were estimated to
be in the high double-digit million Swiss Francs per year.
</p>
<p>The decision to maintain three, comparably large, international airports in a
small country like Switzerland was, to a great extent, political. Especially keep-
ing the airport in Geneva was a political decision to manifest the equality between
the French and German speaking parts of the country. However, political decisions
that do not follow the logic of markets have their price and, in the case of Swissair,
that price was substantial. The cost-inefficient network structure further reduced
the airline&rsquo;s profits over a period of time when increased competition was already
driving fares down and cutting back profits.
</p>
<p>The analysis up until this point has shown that the effects of liberalization of the
airline market are rather complex. First, opening a new route in a formerly protected
market has the competitive effects analyzed before. Airlines will start opening new
routes, if they can increase their profits by doing so, even if the overall effect is that
industry profits go down. For this isolated effect, strategic alliances, mergers and
acquisitions are forms of collusive behavior that can increase the airline, as well as
the industry profits by coordinating the strategies of the airlines. Hence, the analysis
predicts that there is a strong tendency to move in the direction of a more concen-
trated industry, but the overall welfare effects of concentration are unclear, because
concentration allows the airlines to move closer in the direction of a monopolistic
solution. Second, opening new routes may have positive network externalities, as
well as cost-saving effects, if the extended network can be organized in a more cost
efficient way. There are two ways to achieve such a goal: either by an extension of
an airline&rsquo;s own network (internal growth), by the formation of strategic alliances,
or by mergers and acquisitions (external growth). Both strategic options have their
own advantages and disadvantages and it would be beyond the purpose of this case
study to analyze them in detail.
</p>
<p>13.4 How About Swissair?
</p>
<p>The analysis of the last sections has shown that market liberalization was likely to
erode profits by intensifying competition and that decreasing average costs could
easily make airlines unprofitable. Internal, as well as external, growth strategies</p>

<p>(alliance formation, mergers and acquisitions) were key to managing profits during
a period of time when the whole industry was likely to consolidate. It is, there-
fore, no surprise that the world&rsquo;s first and largest global alliance, Star Alliance, was
founded in 1997.
</p>
<p>European market liberalization was more of a challenge than an opportunity for
Swissair, because the vote against the ratification of the EEA Treaty in 1992 implied
that Switzerland had to renegotiate the restrictive, bilateral air service agreements
with every single EU member-state. Additionally, equal access for Switzerland-
based airlines to the EU market was granted only in combination with the Agree-
ment on Free Movement of Persons, which was not fully in force before 2004. Table
13.1 gives an overview of the main factors that contributed to Swissair&rsquo;s demise.
</p>
<p>Given the above arguments and, despite of the impediments that resulted from
the non-membership in EEA, it seems straightforward that Swissair had its own
growth strategy, the Hunter strategy, with the objective to reach a 20 percent market
share in Europe. Its aim was to increase its market share by the acquisition of
smaller airlines instead of by entering into alliance agreements. (In 1989, however,
Swissair was the first European airline to seal a partnership agreement with the
overseas carrier, Delta Airlines. Part of the arrangement was a mutual, 5% equity
swap. One year later, a similar deal was made with Singapore Airlines.) These
airlines created the so-called &ldquo;Qualifier Group.&rdquo; Table 13.2 gives an overview of
the acquisitions, as of 2000.
</p>
<p>As can be seen, the Hunter strategy exclusively targeted airlines from smaller
European countries like Belgium, Austria, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Portugal and
Ireland and, thereby, bypassed the more important and mature markets in Italy,
Germany and France.
</p>
<p>The idea was to funnel traffic from the accessed markets through Zurich and
Brussels to establish two principal hubs within Europe. One key problem with this
strategy was, however, a lack of network externalities and cost synergies, because
the different networks did not fit together well. On top of that, the strategy di-
luted the company&rsquo;s valuable brand, because of the lower quality standards of the
acquired carriers (effectively only carriers that had been shunned by the other al-
liances). The dilution of the brand further undermined Swissair&rsquo;s ability to extract
premium fares from its passengers.</p>

<p>13.5 Concluding Remarks
</p>
<p>Economic analysis is not like a crime novel where, in the end, the detective man-
ages to perfectly solve the case and to identify the culprit. In economics, there
usually is no single culprit and the best an economist can hope for is to identify
some of the more important contributing factors, which are related to the industry,
regulatory and, ultimately, market context in which Swissair was embedded. Man-
agement failure may have played another important role, upon which economists
can only speculate without further information. Nevertheless, as the above analysis
has shown, management happens within a political, legal and regulatory, as well as
economic context that, together, created a huge handicap for Swissair.
</p>
<p>1. Increasing competition drove profits down and created a situation of cutthroat
competition in which some carriers could not survive.
</p>
<p>2. The decision not to ratify the EEA Treaty made it difficult for Swissair to get a
foothold in the profitable EEA markets.
</p>
<p>3. Growth strategies had to take this strategic disadvantage into consideration and
Swissair had to acquire what was left on the market. The resulting network
structure was far from optimal. Market share alone was not a good objective.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this case study was not to develop a detailed analysis of the eco-
nomics of aviation industry in general, or the insolvency of Swissair in particular,
but to illustrate how different economic theories, combined with empirical facts
about politics and law, can be used to better understand certain aspects of reality.</p>

<p>The purpose of scientific theories is to develop hypotheses about causal relation-
ships and to test them empirically. This is why the mathematical concept of a
function is very important in both the natural and the social sciences. A function
is a mapping from a set of explanatory variables onto a set of explained variables.
One should know simple functions from high school: in order to define a function,
it is usually assumed that a variable x, which is an element of some set X , and a
variable y, which is an element of some set Y , exist and that y is related to x by
some mapping f W X ! Y . Such a function is the easiest representation of a causal
mechanism. If one states that y D f .x/, one means that some &ldquo;state&rdquo; y is caused
by some &ldquo;state&rdquo; x and the function f .:/ represents this causal relationship between
x and y. One calls x the explanatory and y the explained variable, because y is
caused or &ldquo;explained&rdquo; by x via the function f .:/. Look at the following example:
an individual demand function x.p/ assumes a relationship between a market price
p and a quantity x that the consumer is willing to buy at this price. This is a causal
relationship that is represented by the function x.:/ and for which the price, p, is
the explanatory and the quantity, x, is the explained variable.

<p>320 14 Mathematical Appendix
</p>
<p>The simple, one-explanatory&ndash;one-explained-variable function is convenient, but
often too simplistic to appropriately cope with economic phenomena. In social
systems there are usually several factors that causally determine some outcome. In
the case of individual or market demand for some good, i , for example, it is not
only the price of this good, pi , that determines demand, but also the prices for other
goods, as well as the income of the individual. With n goods, one would, therefore,
have prices, p1; : : : ; pi ; : : : ; pn, and income, b, that explain demand, xi , and one
has to denote this by means of a demand function that depends on all these variables,
xi.p1; : : : ; pi ; : : : ; pn; b/. Otherwise, one would not be able to fully understand the
causal mechanisms at work.
</p>
<p>There are two important fields of application for functions that represent causal
mechanisms. First, it might be important to understand how the change in one
explanatory variable changes the explained variable because, in empirical tests, it is
often possible to measure changes in some variables, but not their absolute values.
In order to describe those changes one can use the concept of the partial derivative
of a function. The next subchapter introduces and works with partial derivatives.
</p>
<p>Second, there are important cases in which a causal system is described by sev-
eral functions. In markets, for example, both supply, y.p/, and demand, x.p/, are
of importance. Supply and demand are mappings from explanatory to explained
variables. In such situations, it is a standard problem to analyze whether it is
possible to find values of the explanatory variables that are consistent with some
constraints on the explained variables. In the case of supply and demand, such a
constraint is the condition that supply equals demand, x.p/ D y.p/ (equilibrium).
If one asks if a price exists such that supply equals demand, one asks, from a math-
ematical point of view, if a value p exists such that x.p/ � y.p/ D 0. In other
words, one is looking for the root of the equation x.p/ � y.p/. This will be done
in the subchapter after the next.
</p>
<p>Functions are rather abstract and complicated tools. In order to avoid complica-
tions, assume throughout this book that the domain, as well as the codomain, of all
functions are the set of real numbers and that all functions are continuous and have
no &ldquo;kinks.&rdquo; Why this is important, as well as more general properties of functions,
will be discussed in math class.
</p>
<p>14.1 Functions with Several Explanatory Variables
</p>
<p>This subchapter now leaves the demand and supply context behind to talk about
functions more generally. Most people are familiar with the y D f .x/ notation of
functions. (y no longer stands for supply, but for an arbitrary explained variable and
x no longer stands for demand, but for an arbitrary explanatory variable, from now
on.) For a function with only one explanatory variable, it is possible to use a very
lean notation in order to be able to describe a change in the explained variable that
is caused by a (small, infinitesimal) change in the explanatory variable: f 0.x/. For
example, the derivative of f .x/ D x2 is denoted as f 0.x/ D 2 � x. There is nothing
wrong with this notation, but it is not sufficiently precise, if one faces a problem</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.1 Functions with Several Explanatory Variables 321
</p>
<p>with several explanatory variables. Assume that there are two explanatory variables
x1 and x2, and denote by y D f .x1; x2/ the causal relationship. If one denotes
derivatives as f 0.x1; x2/ one cannot distinguish between changes in x1 or x2. One,
therefore, has to introduce a way to denote derivatives that solves this problem. In
principle, there are several ways to do so. For example, one could use the notation
f 1.x1; x2/, f
</p>
<p>2.x1; x2/ for the derivatives with respect to x1 and x2. However, this
is not the usual convention.
</p>
<p>Let x1; : : : ; xn be the explanatory variables. One is interested in the changes
of the function f evaluated at some point a1; : : : ; an, which is caused by some
infinitesimal change in xi , holding all other explanatory variables constant (com-
parative statics). The most common notation for these so-called partial derivatives
is given by:
</p>
<p>@f .a1; : : : ; an/
</p>
<p>@xi
; i D 1; : : : ; n:
</p>
<p>The notation f .a1; : : : ; an/ reminds one that one is looking for the derivative of
the function at a specific point .a1; : : : ; an/. The &ldquo;@&rdquo;-sign is pronounced as &ldquo;del&rdquo;
and is reminiscent of the definition of partial derivatives by means of the difference
coefficient,

The notation &ldquo;d&rdquo; represents a discrete change in xi and f .:/, respectively, and
</p>
<p>@ indicates the limit of this change, if dxi becomes arbitrarily small (converges to
zero).
</p>
<p>In order to be able to work with partial derivatives, one has to generalize the
rules of differentiation. Here are the most important ones:

<p>Chain rule For a number of scientific problems, the causal chain between ex-
planatory and explained variables is more complex, because the effect of some
explanatory on the explained variable is mediated by some &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; variable.
For example, it could be that some variable, xi , has an influence on the intermediary
variable z, z D g.xi/, and z has an influence on y, y D Qf .x1; : : : xi�1; z; xiC1; xn/.
(For simplicity, assume that there is no direct effect of xi on y, which will gener-
alize the analysis in the next section. One calls this function Qf .:/, because it is a
function of z and one has to be able to distinguish it from f .:/, which is a func-
tion of xi . One can denote this structure as y D f .x1; : : : xi�1; xi ; xiC1; xn/ D
Qf .x1; : : : xi�1; g.xi/; xiC1; xn/.
</p>
<p>The individual demand function can be used as an example. One has assumed
that individual demand is a function of prices and income, b. If one further assumes
that income is, itself, determined by some other factors, like qualification, then
one gets a chain of causal effects: qualification determines income and income
determines demand.
</p>
<p>In a situation like this, one gets the following rule for the differentiation of f .:/
with respect to xi :
</p>
<p>@f .a1; : : : ; an/
</p>
<p>@xi
D @
</p>
<p>Qf .a1; : : : ; an/
@z
</p>
<p>� @g.ai/
@xi
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>The above expression is intuitive: xi has an influence on z. This effect is captured
by the second term of the product. The induced change in z, in turn, influences y.
This is captured by the first term.
</p>
<p>If xi has an additional direct effect on y, one gets a function y D Qf .x1; : : : xi�1;
xi ; xiC1; xn; z/. The derivative with respect to xi must, therefore, also include this
direct effect:
</p>
<p>@f .a1; : : : ; an/
</p>
<p>@xi
D @
</p>
<p>Qf .a1; : : : ; an; z/

<p>C @
Qf .a1; : : : ; an; z/
</p>
<p>@z
� @g.ai/
</p>
<p>@xi
:
</p>
<p>A frequent application of partial derivatives is to estimate the effect of a discrete
change, or simultaneous changes, in the explanatory variables on the explained vari-
able (for example, because only discrete changes can be measured empirically).
This can be done by means of the total differential.</p>

</p>
<p>The right-hand side is a linear function of xi , because the partial derivative is eval-
uated at a given point a1; : : : ; an. However, this means that one can estimate the
effect of an explanatory variable on y by means of a linear approximation, which is
sometimes also called the linear form. Figure 14.1 illustrates this method.
</p>
<p>Graphically speaking, the slope of the tangent line is equal to the partial deriva-
tive of the function at a given point. As can be seen, for discrete changes in xi there
is a gap between the true effect on y and the effect that is measured by the linear
approximation: the linear approximation overestimates the true effect, in this ex-
ample. However, if dxi becomes very small, the &ldquo;error&rdquo; becomes arbitrarily small
and vanishes in the limit for an infinitesimal change in xi . One of the reasons why
linear approximations are popular is that linear systems can be analyzed by means
of linear algebra, which is powerful and simplifies the analysis considerably.
</p>
<p>The following will reveal how the above rules can be used to determine deriva-
tives of specific functions.</p>

<p>The additive structure of the function implies that the different variables do not

<p>The multiplicative structure implies that the partial derivatives, with respect to one
variable, also depend on the other variable. However, in order to determine the
derivative, the other variable can be treated as a number, because it is, in fact, a
number, given that the partial derivative is an exercise in comparative statics (which
means that all other variables are treated as constants).

All other rules that one has learned in school remain applicable to this gen-
</p>
<p>eralized problem. If, for example, the problem is to determine the derivative of
f .x/ D 10 � lnŒx&#141;, with respect to x, it follows that f 0.x/ D 10=x. One can use
this function to generalize the rules in the direction of functions with more than one
variable. In order to do so, recognize that the above function has multiple variables
already, because it is a function of x as well as 10, f .x; 10/, because 10 influences
the result. Now, assume that one is not only interested in the partial derivative of
this function at 10, but also at 9; 11; : : :. In this case, one can either determine
the derivative for each case separately, or one can replace the specific number 10
by a dummy variable. If one redefines x by x1 and calls the dummy variable x2,
one ends up with a new function f .x1; x2/ D x2 � lnŒx1&#141;. However, now one has
crossed the border from standard to multivariate analysis. The partial derivative of
this function, with respect to x1, can now be determined:

<p>It is time for a quick plausibility check: if x2 D 10, one gets 10=x1, which is
reassuring. What one sees, from this example, is that one treats all the explanatory</p>

<p>14.2 Solution to Systems of Equations
</p>
<p>Economists are interested in equilibria, because they tell them something about the
logical consistency of the assumptions of a model. As already stated, an equilib-
rium exists, if there is a price such that supply equals demand. Supply and demand,
however, are both functions, which implies that the previous chapters have implic-
itly talked about a property of mathematical objects (functions). If x.p/ and y.p/
are the market-demand and market-supply functions, an equilibrium is a price p�,
such that x.p�/ D y.p�/. One can, alternatively, rearrange this condition to get
x.p�/ � y.p�/ D 0: excess demand has to be equal to zero. If one looks at the
problem from this perspective, one can see that the economic problem of the exis-
tence of an equilibrium is equivalent to the mathematical problem of the existence
of a root of a function, the excess demand function ED.p/ WD x.p/ � y.p/.
</p>
<p>Most students will have touched the problem of the existence of roots in high
school: a function has a maximum or minimum, if its first derivative is zero. The
intermediate-value theorem is useful, in this respect, because it specifies sufficient
conditions that guarantee the existence of a root of a function ED.p/: ED.:/&rsquo;s
domain has to be closed, ED.:/ has to be continuous and at least two prices, p and
p0, exist, such that ED.p/ &lt; 0 &lt; ED.p0/.
</p>
<p>In order to be able to analyze problems like the one above, one needs a little
knowledge about how to solve functions. The above problem is very simple, be-
cause it only has one equation in one explanatory variable: ED.p/ D 0. In a
number of more realistic situations, the problem is more complex, however. As-
sume, for example, that there is not one, but two markets, with goods 1 and 2, and
one wants to know if prices exist that equilibrate both markets simultaneously. The
mathematical problem becomes:
</p>
<p>ED1.p1; p2/ D 0 ^ ED2.p1; p2/ D 0;
</p>
<p>with ED1.:/, ED2.:/ being the excess-demand functions for both markets, which
are functions of both prices, p1 and p2. The mathematical problem is to find a
solution to a system of two equations and two unknowns.
</p>
<p>In reality, there are many more goods and services that are simultaneously traded
in markets, such that one has to specify n markets with excess-demand functions
and an equilibrium exists, if the system of n equations in n unknowns has a solution.
This is a rather involved problem, which is why I restrict my attention to, at most,
two equations and two unknowns and one also restricts one&rsquo;s attention to linear</p>

<p>functions, most of the time in this book. Here, I denote the explanatory variables
by x1; x2, the explained variables by y1; y2 and the causal mechanisms by y1 D
f1.x1; x2/; y2 D f2.x1; x2/.
</p>
<p>Assume that one has to identify a pair of explanatory variables, x�1 and x

</p>
<p>conjectured from the intermediate-value theorem, it is not guaranteed that such a
solution exists for general functions. However, if both equations are linear, one can
use methods from linear algebra to identify the solution. Let
</p>
<p>f1.x1; x2/ D a1 C b1 � x1 C c1 � x2; f2.x1; x2/ D a2 C b2 � x1 C c2 � x2
</p>
<p>be a linear system of equation with a1; b1; c1; a2; b2; c2 as the exogenous parameters
of the equations. (a1; a2) are the intercepts and the other parameters measure the
respective slopes. The problem of finding a zero is then given as:
</p>
<p>a1 C b1 � x�1 C c1 � x�2 D 0 ^ a2 C b2 � x�1 C c2 � x�2 D 0:
</p>
<p>This problem has a unique solution, if the two equations are not parallel:
</p>
<p>x�1 D
a1 � c2 � a2 � c1
b2 � c1 � b1 � c2
</p>
<p>; x�2 D
a1 � b2 � a2 � b1
b2 � c1 � b1 � c2
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>These formulas give one the general solution to the problem. In order to make sure
that the denominator does not become zero, one has to, in addition, assume that
b2 � c1 � b1 � c2 D 0 is excluded. If one inserts specific numbers, one can see what
the general solution implies.
</p>
<p>One can calculate the above solution with a little effort by, for example, solving
the first equation for x1, which yields x1 D �a1=b1 � c1=b1x2. This equation
is an intermediate step that can be used to eliminate x1 in the second equation,
a2C b2 � .�a1=b1� c1=b1x2/C c2 �x2 D 0. Now, one is left with only one equation
with one unknown variable that can be solved for x2.
</p>
<p>This approach comes to an end, if one is confronted with a problem with more
than two variables and unknowns. In such a case, one can use techniques from
matrix algebra to characterize a solution.
</p>
<p>Another problem may exist, if the equations are not linear. It would be far beyond
the scope of this textbook to dig deeper into the solution of systems of nonlinear
equations.
</p>
<p>14.3 Elasticities
</p>
<p>The measurement and comparison of changes is very important in economics and
market research. So-called elasticities are a bread-and-butter concept with which
everyone should be familiar. This subchapter will introduce the problems to which
elasticities provide an answer and introduce the concept formally.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.3 Elasticities 327
</p>
<p>Assume one wants to know how demand x.p/ reacts to price changes. To be
more specific, I will analyze the demand for bread and will assume that the demand
function is linear, x.p/ D 100 � p. Additionally, the price is in Swiss Francs and
the quantity is in kilos.
</p>
<p>An obvious candidate for the measurement of the effect of price changes is the
partial derivative of the demand function:
</p>
<p>dx
</p>
<p>dp
D x0.p/ D �1:
</p>
<p>This finding has a very straightforward interpretation: an increase in the price of
bread by one Swiss Franc reduces the demand by one kilo.
</p>
<p>This is a perfectly reasonable and informative statement and one could leave it
at that. However, it has one disadvantage that limits its usefulness in practice: the
instrument depends on the units in which one measures the dependent, as well as
the independent, variable. Why is this a problem? Assume that one measures bread
in grams instead of kilos. In this case, the demand function would be x.p/ D
100; 000� 1; 000 � p and the partial derivative becomes:
</p>
<p>dx
</p>
<p>dp
D x0.p/ D �1; 000:
</p>
<p>This is, again, a perfectly reasonable number: an increase in the price of bread by
one Swiss Franc reduces the demand by 1,000 grams. However, without knowing
the units of measurement, one cannot compare the two numbers and, at first glance,
one could conclude that they are referring to completely different markets.
</p>
<p>The same thing happens if one measures the price in Rappen instead of Franks.
The demand function becomes x.p/ D 100 � 0:01 � p, and the first derivative is
</p>
<p>dx
</p>
<p>dp
D x0.p/ D �0:01 W
</p>
<p>an increase in the price of bread by 1 Rappen reduces the demand for bread by 0.01
kilos (or 10 grams).
</p>
<p>This dependence on the units of measurement also limits the usefulness of the
instrument, because it makes it difficult to compare changes between countries that
use different currencies. However, it is a potentially interesting question to ask if
Swiss customers react more or less strongly to price changes than, for example,
the French customers. Nevertheless, even within a country, it may be interesting
to understand if the demand for bread reacts more or less strongly to price changes
than does the demand for smartphones and it is very hard to make the units of
measurement for these two products commensurable.
</p>
<p>This is why economists use a measure that is independent of the units of mea-
surement. The basic idea is to focus on relative instead of absolute changes. The
absolute change in demand is given by dx and the relative change can be con-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>328 14 Mathematical Appendix
</p>
<p>structed by dividing the absolute change by some reference level xr :
</p>
<p>relative change in demand D absolute change in demand
reference level of demand
</p>
<p>D dx
xr
</p>
<p>D x � x
r
</p>
<p>xr
:
</p>
<p>The same can be done for price changes. Let dp be the price change and pr the
reference price, one gets:
</p>
<p>relative change in price D absolute change in price
reference level of price
</p>
<p>D dp
pr
</p>
<p>D p � p
r
</p>
<p>pr
:
</p>
<p>The relative changes are independent of the units of measurement, because they
cancel out: if the numerator is measured in, for example, kilos or Swiss Francs, the
denominator is measured in kilos or Swiss Francs, as well. Relative changes can be
transformed into percentage changes, by multiplying them by 100.
</p>
<p>Now that the units of measurement have been eliminated, one can come back
to the initial question of how to measure changes in demand that are caused by
changes in prices. An elasticity relates the relative change of one variable (demand)
to the relative change in another variable (price):
</p>
<p>price elasticity of demand D relative change in demand
relative change in price
</p>
<p>or, more formally:
</p>
<p>�xp D
dx=x
</p>
<p>dp=p
D dx
</p>
<p>dp
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>x
:
</p>
<p>This elasticity is called the price elasticity of demand and it measures the percentage
change in demand that is caused by a 1% change in the price.
</p>
<p>If one allows for infinitesimal changes in prices, one can use partial derivatives
to characterize elasticities:
</p>
<p>�xp D
dx=x
</p>
<p>dp=p
D dx
</p>
<p>dp

<p>p
</p>
<p>x
D @x
</p>
<p>@p
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>x
:
</p>
<p>The elasticity one gets for infinitesimal changes is also called point elasticity.
This determines one important elasticity, but the concept can also be used to
</p>
<p>determine changes in demand that are caused by changes in other explanatory vari-
ables, as well: for example, income levels or prices of other goods. Definitions
14.1&ndash;14.3 cover the most commonly used elasticities of demand. The following
notation is used: the demand for good i is a function of the price of good i , pi , as
well as of the prices of other goods j , pj , as well as income b.</p>

<p>Elasticities can be positive or negative. Economists usually use the convention
to talk about elasticities in absolute values (i.e. the modulus of the function), unless
this is misleading. This convention allows them to use the following qualitative
categories (expressed in absolute terms):</p>
