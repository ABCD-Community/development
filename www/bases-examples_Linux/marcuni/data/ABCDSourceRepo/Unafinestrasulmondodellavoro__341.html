<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>The purpose of this volume is that of making standards of basic 
employment law, accessible to everybody, even to non-lawyers.
Primarily, it focuses on young people. They are facing a twofold 
difficulty: because of their limited experience, they have a limi-
ted negotiating power with the employer, and thus exposes them 
to a higher risk of exploitation; and, they also are the group most 
frequently hired through &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; contracts. Flexible contracts 
have a specific regulation, different from the one of open-ended 
contracts.
This book is part of the &ldquo;A window on the world of work&rdquo; project 
of University of Milano &ndash; Bicocca. The project is promoted by the 
Students&rsquo; Association of Bicocca and the Left Wing List. Within 
this project, graduate students of the Faculty of Law, practitioners 
and young lawyers specialized in employment law, have joined 
their skills to create a platform of labour law training for students 
by organizing practical thematic conferences and a point of per-
manent information.
This volume is a tool of dissemination, aimed at bringing the op-
portunity given by the training project outside the gates of the 
University.
The first chapters of this text describe the atypical employment 
contracts (fixed-term employment contract, part-time employ-
ment contract, project-based employment contract, agency con-
tract, outsourcing contract and contract as a working member of 
a cooperative), training contracts (apprenticeship and internship 
employment contract) and occasional employment contracts 
(temporary and ancillary labour).
The last chapters are dedicated to two of the major issues young 
workers often have to deal with: the transition from one job to a </p>

</p>
<p>better one (resignation) and protection of maternity leave.
This work does not aim to academically and comprehensively tre-
at these subjects: it is rather moved by the spirit of giving to anyo-
ne, non-lawyers as well, the ability to access the raw information 
to understand the regulation of their employment contract.

<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>In 2013, in Lombardy, the unemployment rate of the university 
graduates aged 25 to 29, namely is the five years after the end of the 
studies, reaches 13%; at the same time, the unemployment rate of 
high-school graduates aged 20 to 24 (again, the five years after the 
end of the studies) is nearly 24%, while it is as high as 55% among 
people aged 15 to 19 who have not gone beyond primary school. 
Similar differences, obviously taking into account higher levels 
of unemployment, are nowadays found nationwide. Even in the 
past, in Italy, the transition from the education system to the la-
bor market used to be less difficult for young people with a higher 
education profile. Despite common opinion, in regard to the risk 
of being unemployed in the process of entry into the labor market, 
having achieved a higher level of education grants an advantage, 
which during periods of economic crisis tends to be bigger. Howe-
ver, the clich&eacute; that education &ldquo;does not pay&rdquo; has its foundation. As 
a matter of fact, the yield of education, as far as it concerns the risk 
of unemployment when entering the labor market, is relatively 
low in Italy, lower than in other European countries.
Furthermore, it is more and more clear that a high level of edu-
cation not always ensures access to positions with a high level of 
professional qualification. In the Italy of the Seventies and Eighties 
of the last century, when the parents of the current university&rsquo;s 
students were entering the labor market, over half of the gradu-
ates found their first job in a managerial or intellectual position. 
Currently this percentage has more than halved and most recent 
graduates find a first job opportunity in technical or clerical posi-
tions. Even in Lombardy, the Italian most developed region, out of 
over 25 thousand young graduates who managed to find their first 
job in 2013, only slightly more than 35% found managerial or in-</p>

</p>
<p>tellectual occupations, while nearly half of them found technical 
or clerical occupations. However, if we consider the quality of the 
first job, the relative advantage of the newly university graduated 
compared to the newly high-school graduated remains relatively 
high, rather it has increased over the last years. Considering this po-
int of view too, a higher level of education rewards young people 
entering into the labor market, albeit less than in the past. The fact 
is that, in Italy, the increasing level of education from generation 
to generation was not matched by a parallel increasing of the labor 
qualification demand levels by businesses and public sector.
This is not just an Italian phenomenon since in all European coun-
tries, among young people who manage to find a job, are becoming 
increasingly more those who perform an activity for which, un-
til recently, a lower level of education was enough. Although the 
question is whether the over-education phenomenon is oversta-
ted, since the importance of soft skills (ability to work in groups, to 
cope with situations of sudden crises, etc.), which need more com-
plex abilities of those learned in high-school, has grown. In Italy, 
however, this growing imbalance is better explained with a low 
demand of highly qualified labor rather than with over-education. 
Indeed, with regard to young people aged 25 to 39, a percentage of 
university graduates of almost 15 percentage points lower than the 
European average is accompanied of a percentage of employment 
in intellectual and technical professions of nearly 10 points lower. 
This combination relegates Italy among the last countries in Euro-
pe, together with some eastern European countries.
This de-skilling process of the first employment opportunities for 
graduates has been accompanied by a fragmentation of the legal 
status. In the Seventies and early Eighties more than 60% of young 
people could find a permanent contract of employment as first one. 
The progressive reduction of this type of employment was stronger 
for the young university graduates, who were much more affected 
by the new forms of para-subordinate work. Among young gradu-
ates who have found their first job in Lombardy during 2013, not 
even 16% has been hired as permanent employee and only 16% of 
them started working as a freelancer or self-employed worker, whi-
le all the others were hired with fixed-term employment contracts 
(almost 48%) or have had ancillary labour (over 20%). Considering 
that over half of the self-employed and private workers work for 
a single customer (a percentage that exceeds 85% in regard to pa-
ra-subordinates), it can be said that the two traditional figures, the </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>one of the open-ended employee and the one of the self-employed 
or private worker with a large customer base do not reach 28% of 
graduates who have found their first job. Finally, considering that 
over 13% of males and 35% of females work part-time (almost 60% 
of the males and more than two thirds of the females having not 
found a full-time job), the standards employment area results even 
more limited to recent graduates in Lombardy. As for the rest of 
Italy, the economic crisis has accelerated a long-term trend to the 
growing instability and fragmentation of employment relation-
ships, especially those of young people. 
Therefore, we consider providing all the students of the University 
of Milano - Bicocca (and, I hope students of other universities as 
well) with an overview of the various non-standard employment 
relationships they are, inevitably, going to meet at the end of their 
study period, as a worthy initiative. My hope, as an old universi-
ty professor who has devoted his research to labor issues, is that 
thanks to some of these reports, the newly graduates succeed in 
finding a job as soon as possible, and that just as soon they succeed 
in getting out and finding a more stable and secure job situation.

<p>SUBORDINATE EMPLOYMENT AND SELF-
EMPLOYMENT
</p>
<p>by rIccardo bonato
</p>
<p>The distinction between subordinate employment (employees), 
self-employed workers (the so-called VAT owners) and subcontract 
workers (eg.: collaborators) affect the rights and obligations of em-
ployees towards the employer. For example, rights of a subordinate 
worker comprehend:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the application of the National Collective Bargaining Agree-
ment (It.: Contratto Collettivo Nazionale di Lavoro, or CCNL) 
&ndash; minimum wages, holidays, leaves, maternity, Christmas bo-
nuses, etc.;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the application of the rules on unfair dismissal pursuant to 
former art. 18 of the italian Workers&rsquo; Statute (It.: Statuto dei 
Lavoratori), formerly art. 8 l. 604/1966;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Mandatory Severance Indemnity (It.: Trattamento di Fine 
Rapporto, or TFR);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the possibility to get access the best tools of income support 
(eg.: unemployment benefits);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; a different social security and fiscal taxation.
</p>
<p>Under Article 2094 of the Italian Civil Code (It.: Codice Civile), the 
employee is the person &ldquo;who is obliged to cooperate in the enterpri-
se providing its own intellectual and manual labor, employed by and 
under the direction of the entrepreneur, through fair returns&rdquo;, i.e. the 
worker is &ldquo;other-directed and employed&rdquo;.
Other-directed and employed means that the worker, in carrying 
out its activities, must meet employer&rsquo;s strict guidelines (the fol-
lowing list is not to be considered complete or exhaustive):</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> RICCARDO BONATO
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the employer gives precise instructions on how the work 
must be performed and sanctions any eventual infringe-
ments of the company&rsquo;s conduct/procedure regulations
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the employee may be part of a group of workers who colla-
borate to reach a result useful to the employer;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the production tools (eg.: equipment) are owned by the em-
ployer;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the workplace is an environment in use to the employer;
&bull;&emsp; the employee:
</p>
<p> &raquo; is paid regardless of the outcome of his work or economic 
activity;
</p>
<p> &raquo; is paid periodically;
 &raquo; undergoes a work schedule;
 &raquo; is obliged to plan holidays and leaves together with the 
</p>
<p>employer.
</p>
<p>Act n. 92/2012 (the so called &ldquo;Riforma Fornero&rdquo;) introduced a provi-
sion aimed at countering the illegitimate use of VAT to disguise em-
ployment relationships. There is a presumption of subordination 
for the worker who encounters two out of these three elements:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; relationship duration with the same employer of more than 
8 months per year for two consecutive years;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; payments by the employer being more than 80% of the to-
tal annual fees received by the employee over 2 consecutive 
years;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the employee has a fixed place in one of the employer&rsquo;s sites.
</p>
<p>This rule, however, does not apply in the following cases:
&bull;&emsp; if the service performed by those who own VAT is connoted 
</p>
<p>by &ldquo;high level skills&rdquo; acquired through significant training 
courses (eg.: titles awarded at the end of the 2nd education 
cycle and training), or by technical-practical skills acquired 
through &ldquo;relevant experiences&rdquo; gained in the actual perfor-
ming of the activities (eg.: apprenticeship diplomas);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; if the VAT owner has a gross income due to self-employment 
exceeding 1.25 times the smallest taxable income for the pay-
ment of social security contributions, under Act 233 of 1990 
(&euro;&emsp;18.663&emsp;in&emsp;2012);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; if the registration to a professional college or class, board, re-
cord, role or qualified profession list is required in order to 
perform the activities.</p>

<p>ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

</p>
<p>FIXED-TERM EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
</p>
<p>by rIccardo elIa
</p>
<p>legal SourceS and laWfulneSS on fIxed-term emPloyment 
contract
</p>
<p>Fixed-term employment contract is governed by the Decrete Law. 
368/2001, and by its subsequent amendments, the last of which oc-
curred in 2014 with the dl 34/2014 converted into Law 78/2014.
Until the last intervention of the emergency decree, in order to offer 
the necessary lawfulness of the fixed-term employment contract, 
the law involved two requisites, a formal one and a substantial one: 
(a) written agreement &ndash; failing which the contract is considered null 
and void &ndash; and (b) the existence of a reason that justifies the affixing 
of a term. The term could be of a technical, productive, organiza-
tional or substitutive nature.
Nowadays, however, the use of fixed-term employment contracts 
have been &ldquo;liberalized&rdquo;, and the justifying reason is no longer ne-
cessary. Basically, today it is always possible to start a fixed-term 
employment contract lasting no more than thirty-six months 
(including any possible extension). The maximum limit, in addi-
tion to the total aforementioned duration, consists of the number 
of fixed-term employment contracts signed by employers with 
more than 5 employees (no more than 20% of the open-ended em-
ployment contracts). On the contrary, it is not mandatory for em-
ployers with less than 5 employees to follow such a proportion.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> RICCARDO ELIA
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>Being understood the requirement of written agreement, failing 
which the contract is considered null and void.
Under certain assumption, the stipulation of a fixed-term employ-
ment contract is not subject to the second of the above mentioned 
conditions of lawfulness.
Some exceptions are related to specific workers or manufacturing 
sectors (art. 10, D.Lgs. 368/01), including, for example, fixed-term em-
ployment contracts lasting no more than five years and signed with 
the managers.
In any case, no fixed-term hiring can be carried out in the following 
cases (art. 3 D.Lgs. 368/01):
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; to replace employees on strike;
&bull;&emsp; in production units that have carried out, within the pre-
</p>
<p>vious 6 months, procedures of collective redundancies;
&bull;&emsp; in production units where a suspension of contractual re-
</p>
<p>lations or working hours reduction is present, with wage 
supplements rights involving workers assigned to the same 
duties to which the fixed-term employment contract relates;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; by companies that have not performed the assessment of 
work place safety risks.
</p>
<p>unlaWfulneSS of term and comPenSatIon for damageS
</p>
<p>The employee may take legal action to assert the invalidity of the 
term applied to the employment contract. The appeal must be 
made within 120 days from the termination of the contract and 
within the next 180 days conciliation or court appeal should be 
attempted.
The consequence of court assessment on unlawfulness of term is 
the transformation of the fixed-term employment contract into 
an open-ended employment contract, with immediate effect, and the 
condemnation of the employer to pay the employee a compensa-
tion for damages of an amount (identified by the court) between 
2,5 and 12 months salary.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>THE ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>The fixed-term employment contract will be automatically termi-
nated upon the end date. Termination before that dateline is go-
verned by art. 2119 c.c. According to this rule, the termination ante 
tempus is only allowed for just cause, that is, only when there is a 
reason that does not allow the continuation, even temporary, of 
the employment relationship.
In case of unfair dismissal before the end date, the worker will re-
ceive damage compensation equal to the amount of wages not 
received from the date of termination to the due date of the em-
ployment.
</p>
<p>extenSIon of the InItIal term and temPorary contInuatIon 
of the relatIonShIP after the deadlIne 
</p>
<p>The extension is approved prior worker&rsquo;s free consent, without 
prejudice to the maximum limit of duration of three years. Since 
the last legislative action, the extension does not require any justi-
fying reason.
However, the extensions are still allowed up to a maximum of five 
times, regardless the number of renewals, provided that they refer 
to the same working activity corresponding to the original con-
tract.
Should the employment relationship continue after the expiry of 
the contractual period, the employer is obliged to pay the worker 
an increase on salary, equal to 20% until the tenth day, and 40% 
for each extra day.
In any case, once the term of contract has expired, the employment 
relationship cannot continue up to 20 more days after the end date 
if the duration of the contract is less than 6 months or up to 30 
more days if the contract lasts longer than 6 months. Otherwise, 
a &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; for the employment transformation arises. From that 
moment the contract must be considered as an open-ended one.
</p>
<p>fIxed-term re-emPloyment of the emPloyee and the max-
Imum duratIon of a fixed-term emPloyment
</p>
<p>At the expiry of the contract term, the employer can re-hire the 
worker through a new fixed-term contract. The only condition re-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> RICCARDO ELIA
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>quired by law is for the employer to observe a certain time interval 
between the two contracts. More precisely, it is necessary to allow 
at least 10 days from the date of expiry of a contract lasting up to 
6 months, or 20 days from the date of expiry of a contract lasting 
more than six months. In case those minimum time intervals re-
quired by law are not observed, the second fixed-term contract is 
to be considered an open-ended one.
Moreover, when two consecutive fixed-term hiring actions are 
seamlessly taken, there is a &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; for the transformation of the 
employment relationship into a open-ended employment starting 
from the contract stipulation.
In any case, the law establishes that the maximum term for fixe-
d-term relationship between the same employer and employee for 
performing work of equal value can not exceed 36 months. If the 
total duration period is not fulfilled, the employment relationship 
is to be considered open-ended starting from the expiry date of 36 
months.
</p>
<p> PrIncIPle of non-discrimination and PrIorIty rIght
</p>
<p>Under the principle of non-discrimination the fixed term worker 
is entitled to holidays and Christmas bonus/thirteenth salary, em-
ployee severance indemnity (&ldquo;TFR&rdquo;) and any other compensation 
provided by the company for the workers with similar fixed-term 
employment contract.
In addition, the law recognizes, for a year, the priority right to per-
manent employment to all those hired with a fixed-term contract 
that have worked for a period exceeding six months.</p>

</p>
<p>PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>by laura carbonera
</p>
<p>baSIcS.
</p>
<p>The open-ended or fixed-term employment contract, is considered 
a part-time one when the working hours, as fixed in each indivi-
dual contract, are less than full time working hours. The 
latter corresponds to the ordinary working hours fixed by law (art. 
3, co. 1, D.Lgs. 66/2003) at 40 hours per week, or to the possible less 
working hours fixed by collective agreements.
The regulation of the part-time employment contract is provided 
by multiple sources, in particular D.Lgs. 61/2000, D.Lgs. 276/2003, 
L. 247/2007 and L. 92/2012 (as well as Circ. Min. Lav. n. 9 of 2004).
The part-time employment contract can be:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; horizontal, when the labor hours reduction refers to the 
ordinary daily working time (the employee works every 
working day of the week but each day for fewer hours);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; vertical, when the job is performed full time but for prede-
termined periods during the week, month and year (the em-
ployee works full-time but only in certain days of the week, 
or in certain weeks of the month or certain months of the 
year);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; mixed, when a part-time employment contract is structured 
combining the horizontal and vertical modes, (for example, 
the employee works every working day of the week: on Mon-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> LAURA CARBONERA
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>days, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays full-time and on Thursdays 
or Fridays part-time).
</p>
<p>The part time employment scheme can be applied as part of any em-
ployment contract, including fixed-term, apprenticeship and out-
sourcing contract, as expressly provided by the so called Fornero 
reform (L. 92/2012).
</p>
<p>form.
</p>
<p>The employment contract must be stipulated in a written form, 
in order to prove the existence of the part-time employment rela-
tionship (ad probationem form). The lack of written form shall not 
render void the contract but determines only a limitation of the 
proofs in a possible judgment: in case it is impossible to provide 
a proof of a part-time employment relationship, upon employee&rsquo;s 
request, existence of a full-time employment relationship can be 
declared starting from the date on which the lack is juridically 
ascertained.
The contract must specify, in a written form, the job duration 
and location with reference to the day, week, month and year; dif-
ferent clauses are allowed only if integrated with elastic or flexible 
clauses (see below). 
</p>
<p>Salary.
</p>
<p>When determining the salary, the part-time worker cannot be 
discriminated merely because hired as (or becoming) a part-time 
worker: the salary cannot be less favorable than that payable to a 
similar full-time worker (with equal contractual status).
The implementation of this principle means that:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The part-time worker must be paid the same hourly wage as 
the full-time worker;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; In consideration of the different work performance, the 
whole retribution as well as its individual items, the week-
day salary, the amount of salary due during illness period, 
maternity period, injury and professional illness, are re-pro-
portioned.</p>

</p>
<p>The prohibition of discrimination operates also in relation to the

The implementation of this principle implies that the part-time 
worker has the same rights as a similar full-time worker with parti-
cular regard to:
</p>

Regarding this issue, we must to distinguish two cases:

</p>
<p>Art. 5, comma 1, D.Lgs. 61/2000 provides that the parties may avail 
themselves of a written agreement, to transform the employ-
ment relationship from full-time to part-time. It is a consensual 
transformation of the employment contract into part-time.
The employee is entitled to refuse the employer&rsquo;s request of tran-
sformation of the contract and such conduct does not constitute 
just cause of dismissal.
The law does not recognize to the full-time worker the right to 
have transformed his contract in a part-time one, even in the 
event of planned part-time staff recruitment.
In the latter case, the employer is required to give immediate no-
tice to his formerly full-time employed staff working in similar 
production units and to take account of any request of full-time 
workers to have their contract transformed into a part-time one.
Special rights are recognized at the full-time worker suffering 
from confirmed oncological pathology: in this case the worker is 
recognized a genuine right to have his contract transformed from 
full-time to part-time and to have his full-time contract restored 
whenever he desires it (this hypothesis was introduced by D.Lgs. 
276/2003).

</p>
<p>Part-time workers &ndash; for the purpose of application of all law and 
contract rules, including discipline provided for in Title III of the 
Statute of workers &ndash; are computed in proportion to the working 
hours actually performed: therefore it is also taken into account 
actual work performed in excess of the scheduled time provided in 
each single contract.</p>

<p>THE ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

</p>
<p>the extra Work and overtIme.
</p>
<p>The contractual provisions of extra work and overtime allow par-
ties in the relationship to vary working hours within its maximum 
duration, without prejudice to the constrains of the format and 
content of the contract.
The extra work, corresponding to the difference between part-ti-
me hours &ndash; agreed between the parties &ndash; and the normal daily time 
schedule, is legitimate in case of horizontal, vertical and mixed par-
t-time (in the latter cases, it is true only if the part-time working 
hours are less than standard weekly ones).
The regulation of extra work is entrusted to collective bargaining 
that can determine the maximum number of feasible additional 
hours, the reasons under which the employer can request it and 
possible consequences in case of exceeding overtime provided by 
the contract (increases or compensatory rests).
 The consent of the employee to handle the extra work is not re-
quired if the collective bargaining provides for and regulates the 
right of the employer to request additional services. If the collecti-
ve agreement does not provide this option, the consent of the em-
ployee, which may be explicit or conclusive, is needed.
Overtime work is the one performed exceeding weekly working 
hours limit (40 hours). As far as it concerns part-time contract it is 
possible only when full time has been achieved and hence only in 
case of vertical or mixed part-time. In this case, overtime rules (the 
ones valid for full-time workers) apply

<p> LAURA CARBONERA
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>the individual written agreement between the employer and the 
worker: that agreement can also be contextual to the employment 
contract&rsquo;s signing.
The worker can avail himself of the assistance of a trade union re-
presentative in the company, appointed by himself.
The collective agreements are delegated by the authority to esta-
blish the terms and conditions in relation to which the employer 
may change the timing and duration of work performance (art. 3, 
co. 8, D.Lgs. 61/2000).
However, even in the absence of provisions of the collective agree-
ment, or regardless of the same, the employer, &ndash; prior agreement 
with the worker &ndash; may apply these clauses to a part-time contract.
The required notice, in order to let the worker know these terms 
&ndash; without prejudice to a different intention of the parties &ndash; is of at 
least two working days, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
The D.Lgs. 276/2003 did not allow the modification of the assent to 
the flexibility of the worker.
The rigor of this provision has been partially mitigated by law 
92/2012 which has intervened in two ways:
&bull;&emsp; assigning to collective bargaining the power and methods that 
</p>
<p>allow the worker to request the removal or the modification of 
the flexible or elastic clauses;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; introducing to workers who are in the conditions governed by

<p>THE PROJECT-BASED EMPLOYMENT 
CONTRACT
</p>
<p>by Irene bega
</p>
<p>The project-based employment contract is governed by artt.61-69 d.l-
gs. 276/2003 (as updated by L. 92/2012 and by D.L. 28 june 2013, n. 
76).The following are excluded from the Directive&rsquo;s scope:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; agents and sales representatives;
&bull;&emsp; anyone engaged in direct selling of goods and services car-
</p>
<p>ried out through &ldquo;outbound&rdquo; call center ;
&bull;&emsp; occasional workers;

lian National Olympic Committee) ;

</p>
<p>a) defInItIon and requIrementS
</p>
<p>The project-based employment contract is a form of self-employ-
ment contract very close to paid employment (but different from 
the latter), defined as para-subordinated work, involving on one 
hand the intention of the employer to recruit staff to be used for 
coordinated and collaborative activities and on the other hand 
the will of the employee to perform his activities in a way that 
differ from those of paid employment.
The so called project-based employment is the only one sub-type 
of para-subordinated employment admitted by law as a result of 
changes introduced by L. 92/2012. This means that the existence 
of a project becomes an essential requisite for the validity and legi-
timacy of the contract.
In order to fit in this type of contract, the art. 61 del d.lgs 276/03 
defines the following requirements;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the coordinated and continuous collaborations must be 
linked to one or more specific projects;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; such specific projects must be determined by the project 
owner;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; such specific projects must be self managed by the worker;
&bull;&emsp; the project must be functionally linked to a particular final 
</p>
<p>result and cannot consist of a mere repetition of the corpo-
rate purpose of the customer, with regard to coordination 
with the organization of the project owner and regardless 
of the time taken to perform the task;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The project must not lead to the performance of purely exe-
cutive and repetitive duties, which can be identified by the 
collective agreements set up by most representative trade 
unions at national level.
</p>
<p>In other words, for an employment contract to be considered 
project-based, not only the existance of a project is necessary, spe-
cified in the contract and independently managed by the worker, 
but it must also be addressed to achieve a result not related to the 
corporate purpose. The project must not simply consist in perfor-
ming repetitive and executive tasks.</p>

<p>THE ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>b) the form
</p>
<p>The project-based employment contract must be executed in a 
written form and shall include the following items:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the duration of the service provided;
&bull;&emsp; a description of the project, including its distinguished con-
</p>
<p>tent and the final result to be achieved;
&bull;&emsp; the consideration and the criteria for its determination as 
</p>
<p>well as payment terms and the expenses reimbursement re-
gulation;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; forms of co-ordination of the project worker provided that 
under no circumstances can not be such as to jeopardize his/
her independence of the work;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; any measure to protect health and safety of the project 
worker.
</p>
<p>In addition, the project-based contract shall not provide any trial 
period.
</p>
<p>c) Salary.
</p>
<p>The project worker is entitled to a remuneration which shall be pro-
portionate to the quality and quantity of the service provided, not 
less than the minimum established by collective bargaining for 
project workers of each business segment and, in any case, based 
on the minimum wage applied in the field comparable to the same 
tasks performed by paid employees.
</p>
<p>d) duty of confIdentIalIty and loyalty 
</p>
<p>The project worker must not engage in activities that compete with 
the ones of his/her employer/s nor, in any event, spread news and 
appreciation related to the programs and their organization, nor, 
in any way, perform acts that might prejudice the activities of the 
same customers.</p>

<p>e) reaSonS to SuSPend contractS: Pregnancy, dISeaSe and 
Injury.
</p>
<p>Pregnancy, disease and injury suspend the project worker&rsquo;s em-
ployment contract without any right to compensation .
It has to be mentioned that only in the event of pregnancy, an ex-
tension of the contract for a period of 180 days is expected.
In case of disease and injury, however, the contract shall termina-
te on the expiry date (if the duration of the contract has been set 
forth) and, in any case, the customer (the employer) may, however, 
end or terminate the contract if the suspension lasts for a period 
exceeding one sixth of the agreed duration, i.e more than thirty 
days for fixed-term contracts, if specified.
</p>
<p>f) reaSonS for termInatIon of a project-Based contract.
</p>
<p>The project-based contract can be ended or terminated in case of:
&bull;&emsp; implementation of the project;
&bull;&emsp; expiration of the term;
&bull;&emsp; early withdrawal of the contract (compared to the due date 
</p>
<p>provided for in the project-based contract or prior to the im-
plementation of the project itself) for just cause;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; early withdrawal of the contract decided by the employer 
in the case of worker&rsquo;s professional unfitness to perform the 
project;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; early termination of the contract decided by the worker, 
expected in the case of advanced notice, only if provided for 
in the employment contract.
</p>
<p>g) conSequenceS cauSed by any breach of project-Based 
contract laW.
</p>
<p>Art. 69 of d.lgs. 276/2003 sanctions those cases where a project-based 
contract does not present the formal requirements established by 
law or disguises an paid-employment relationship.
In both cases, the law provides the transformation of the contract 
into an open-ended employment.</p>

</p>
<p>In particular, as regards the violation of the formal require-
ments of the project-based contract, that article provides that in 
case of failure to identify a specific project, the coordinated colla-
borative contracts are considered as open-term employment con-
tract from the date the relationship has been established. 
Should a project-based contract disguise a paid-employ-
ment contract, it must be converted into an employment con-
tract corresponding to the mode of execution of the same.

</p>
<p>THE AGENCY AGREEMENT
</p>
<p>by roberto lama
</p>
<p>The agency agreement - governed by articles 1742 et seq of Codi-
ce Civile and the provisions of collective economic agreements 
signed by trade unions - creates a legal contract in which one par-
ty (the agent) undertakes the obligation to permanently promote 
upon remuneration, the conclusion of contracts in a given area on 
behalf and in the interest of the other (the principal) .
The agency agreement, in terms of labor is due to the self-employ-
ment&rsquo;s patterns. The agent, indeed, besides assuming the risk of 
the futility of its business activity, operates completely indepen-
dently, thus taking decisions according to his own consideration, 
(for example, how much time to spend on promotion activity, 
the choice of the best strategy to follow or the identification of 
clients whom deserve more attention/efforts). The only limit to 
the agent&rsquo;s autonomy in performing his obligation, is the obser-
vance of the instructions issued by his principal: instructions whi-
ch, being mostly general guidelines on how to perform the work, 
are not capable of affecting the aforementioned agent&rsquo;s autonomy.
The promotion activity aimed at the conclusion of contracts 
between the principal and third parties can be held by the agent ei-
ther on an individual basis or with a company; however, to lawful-
ly carry out business agent&rsquo;s activities it is required to be in posses-
sion of the requirements governed by the Law no. 204/1985 and 
subsequent amendments.
However, it must be noted that the D.Lgs no. 59 of 26.03.2010 (in </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> ROBERTO LAMA
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>force since 12.05.2012 ), which was implemented in the EU Direc-
tive 2006/123 / EC (the so called &ldquo;services directive&rdquo;), in order to 
simplify access and pursuit of the agency activities, has provided, 
among other things:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the suppression of the role of the sales agents (enrollment 
was previously provided by art. 2 of Law no . 204/1985 requi-
red as a mandatory condition of eligibility in pursuit of the 
activities as an agent);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the obligation to submit the SCIA (Certified Notification of 
Business Start up) to the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, 
Handicraft and Agriculture at the beginning of the sales 
agent&rsquo;s activity;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; sales agents&rsquo; registration with Companies&rsquo; Registry.
</p>
<p>The activities typically performed by the agent for the fulfillment 
of his obligations are, simplifying, research in the assigned area of 
potential contractors, the startup and the management of nego-
tiations, the transmission to the principal of the achieved agree-
ments. Among these, it can not be included the conclusion of the 
agreement which remains, precisely, an activity of the principal.
The agency agreement must be contained in a written document; 
a duration time may be established (indefinite as well). In the first 
case, up to the closing date, the parties may end the contract only 
if any of the cases which do not allow, even on a temporary basis, 
the continuation of the contract occurs; if the contract has an in-
definite period, however, the parties may withdraw it regardless of 
the reason by giving notice within a specified period governed by 
law or collective economic agreements.
Either way, at the time of termination of the agency agreement, 
shall the conditions laid down by art. 1751 Cod. civ. and by collec-
tive economic agreements occur, the principal shall pay the agent 
an economic indemnity, the amount of which is variable .
The agent takes the risk that the activity he performs turns out 
to be useless to the principal and, consequently, unproductive for 
him as well. This means that his right to remuneration (which in 
the agency agreement is called commission and takes the form of a 
percentage of the value of the deal promoted) is subject to the con-
clusion of the contract between the third party and the principal, 
and that conclusion must be attributed directly to his interven-
tion. It follows that the agent does not mature any right of remu-
neration in the event that the third and the principal, who came </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>THE ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>in contact thanks to his work, decide not to conclude the contract. 
In this case, however, he must bear all costs incurred in the perfor-
mance of promotional activities later proved useless (travel, room 
and board expenses etc.).
It may also happen that the parties provide - through a special sti-
pulation called &ldquo;del credere fee, (Italian for belief or trust)&rdquo; - a gua-
rantee clause under which the agent, in case the third contractor 
fails to perform the obligation assumed with the stipulation of the 
contract, shall compensate the principal of the damage suffered as 
a result of the failure of the third contractor. It can be assumed that 
such compensation has the form of a penalty due, given the ne-
gligent conduct of the agent who has recruited contractors then 
proved to be willful defaulter. Article 1746 cod. civ. excludes that 
this guarantee can be agreed in general terms, but has to refer to 
individual transactions identified from time to time. In any case, 
the fee payable by the agent cannot be higher than the commis-
sion for that business and, in any case, the agreement of this clause 
includes the agent&rsquo;s right to a special remuneration, additional to 
and distinct from the commission.
Finally, the parties may come to an arrangement in order to limit 
the promotional activity of the agent in the period following the 
expiry date of the agency agreement. This is the so called non-com-
petition agreement permitted by the legislator only if it does 
not last longer than two years. In order to have a legal value, the 
non-competition agreement must cover the same area, customers 
and kind of goods and services for which the agency agreement 
was stipulated and a specific indemnity, intended to compensate 
the agreed future impediment to the conduct of an activity to him 
profitable, must be awarded to the agent. This allowance shall be 
consistent with the duration and the nature of the agency agree-
ment and the amount of the indemnity referred to in art. 1751 cod. 
civ.</p>

<p>WORKER CO-OPERATIVES AND MEMBERS OF 
THE COOPERATIVE.
</p>
<p>by laura carbonera
</p>
<p>Producer and worker co-operative are autonomous associations 
of people who voluntarily cooperate, carrying out an economic 
activity, for their mutual social, economic, and cultural benefit 
committed to self-help in the welfare of working people, possibly 
at more advantageous conditions than those offered by existing 
market (so-called principal of mutuality), taking benefit of the 
members&rsquo; work, who shall be entitled to share the profits of the 
association.
The regulation of the worker co-operative is entrusted to multi-
ple sources: particular note must be payed to art. 2511ss of c.c. and 
L. 142/2001, subsequently amended and supplemented by Law 
30/2003.
There are various types of co-operative, such as, worker co-ope-
ratives, agricultural co-operatives, housing co-operatives, fishery 
co-operatives, consumer co-operatives, transport co-operative, so-
cial co-operatives.
The latter, very common because they can qualify for special be-
nefits, are governed by Law 381/1991 and are intended to pursue 
the general interest of the community to promote human and 
social integration of citizens through the management of social, 
healthcare and educational services (type A), or performing other 
activities (agricultural, industrial, commercial or services) aimed at 
providing work for socially disadvantaged people (type B).</p>

</p>
<p>the dIScIPlIne of the WorkIng member.
</p>
<p>As for the regulation of the working member, the first thing to note is 
that the same establishes with the cooperative two legal relationships:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; an associative relationship;
&bull;&emsp; an employment relationship.
</p>
<p>These are not two equal relationships: the associative relationship 
prevails over the employment one that is considered to be merely 
instrumental to the bond of association (Min. Lav. No. 10/2004 ).
As fas as it concerns the associative relationships, the working 
members are &ldquo;co-stars&rdquo; of the association&rsquo;s performance. This is 
what differentiates them from a regular employment relation-
ship in an enterprise that fulfills an economic purpose. Indeed, 
they have the typical powers and duties arising form the status as 
a co-op member, for example: management power through par-
ticipation in the establishment of the governing bodies and the 
definition of the management structure, participation on the bu-
siness risk and obligation to contribute in the capital formation, 
obligation to put their professional and personal skills at disposal 
depending on the type of activity performed.
As far as it concerns the working relationship established with 
the cooperative, it may have a paid-employment or self-employ-
ment nature (including forms of coordinated and continuous, 
non-occasional relationships) in accordance with the conditions 
set in the internal regulation of the co-operative, approved at the 
DTL: a document that must contain the type of relationship esta-
blished with the working members, recalling the collective agree-
ments applicable to members with the employment contract.
When the employment contract has a subordinated nature, the 
corresponding rules in the Civil Code and the social legislation 
should apply. In order to safeguard the special position of the 
working member, the application of the institutions, typical of 
subordinate employment, is only partial, therefore:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; all the provisions on health and safety at work and insti-
tutions such as severance indemnity and vacation time are 
applied. The aforementioned internal regulation of the 
co-operative may introduce pejorative exemptions with 
respect to working conditions due under the legislative fra-
mework with the only exception of minimum remunera-
tion requirements;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>THE ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the Workers&rsquo; Statute applies, but the exercise of trade union ri-
ghts (Title III Stat. Lav.) must occur through the procedures set 
in the appropriate collective agreements between the natio-
nal associations of the co-operative movement and the most 
representative trade unions;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; co-operative are required to pay an overall remuneration pro-
portionate to the quality and quantity of work performed, but 
not less than the minimum provided - for similar services - by 
the national collective bargaining of respective or similar busi-
ness segment.
</p>
<p>As far as it concerns members who establish an un-subordinated 
working relationship, accident-prevention regulation (D.L. no. 
81/2008 ) and the Workers&rsquo; Statute limited to the Articles 1, 8, 14 
and 15, as long as such rules are compatible with the specific form of 
work performance, applies. They are also entitled to compensation 
not lower than the &ldquo;average in use&rdquo; ones. 
</p>
<p>Salary.
</p>
<p>Working members remuneration consists of a minimum, calculated 
differently depending on the type of working contract between the 
parties (social worker with a subordinated employment contract or 
contract other than subordinated one) and any other additional fee, 
which can be decided by the Assembly.

</p>
<p>Looking at the provisions that regulate the causes and the consequen-
ces of the employment relationship, the principle of primacy of the 
associative relationship on the employment, with regard to which 
the entire L. 142/2001 is informed, appears prominently. Especially:
</p>

the Civil Code Articles 2526 and 2527 c.c. provisions), the

<p>the right of reinstatement in case of unfair dismissal) does 
not apply; however, the court may apply the mandatory sta-

in case the provisions of art. 18 S.L. does not apply), namely 
order the company to pay compensation for the damage ari-
sing as a result.The excluded member&rsquo;s unique remedy possi-
ble, if the conditions apply, is to obtain the annulment of the 
resolution for exclusion. The cancellation of the resolution 
automatically resets the situation prior to the unfair exclu-

struction of the former employment relationship;

<p>Disputes relating only to employment relationship fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Labour Court (Art . 409, par. 3 , c.p.c.; Cass. Ja-
nuary 18, 2005 n. 850; Trib. Bologna July 7, 2010 ).
On the other hand, ordinary procedures apply to disputes between 
members and the co-operative relating to the associative relation-
ship and mutual services, i.e. services that the co-operative provides 
to its members on more advantageous terms than third parties. The 
provision must be understood in a strict sense and cannot be ex-
tended to disputes concerning the substantive welfare rights of the 
worker (art. 5 , para. 2, L. 142/2001; Ord. Cass. January 18, 2005, n. 850 ).
It is important to note that, if the employee has been fired as a result 
of a resolution to exclude him from the social structure, the so called 
Tribunal of the Entrepreneurs is responsible. According to the inter-
pretation given by some courts, the Tribunal of the Entrepreneurs ab-
sorbs the power to hear and decide on the dismissal. This extension 
of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal of the Entrepreneurs results in a 
substantial increase in costs for the worker-actor and longer trials, 
thus consisting in a different treatment (a pejorative one) of the 
working member of the co-operative than other employees. Other 
Courts, in accordance with the requirement of equal treatment, 
consider the Labour Court as more competent.</p>

</p>
<p>OUTSOURCING
</p>
<p>By franceSca camPInI
</p>
<p>defInItIon
</p>
<p>Outsourcing (artt. 20 &ndash; 28 d.legs. 276/03) involves that a qualified 
subject (&ldquo;Supplier&rdquo;, or more commonly &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;) provides em-
ployees to another subject (&ldquo;User&rdquo;). Thus, the outsourced workers 
carry out their work performance within the User&rsquo;s organization, 
but are formally employed by the Supplier. Therefore, in outsour-
cing, an increase of involved subjects in the job relationship occurs 
because to the classical figures of employer and employee the User 
figure is added. The three parties involved are bound to each other 
by means of two different contracts:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; an outsource contract between the User and the Supplier;
&bull;&emsp; an employment contract between the Supplier and the worker.
</p>
<p>Both contracts can be either open-ended or fixed-term.
</p>
<p>aPPlIcatIon fIeld
</p>
<p>a) Involved SubjectS
</p>
<p>The Agencies are accountable for the manpower supply. The Agen-
cies have to be certified by the Ministry of Labour, in which a de-</p>

</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>dicated register has been established. In order to be enrolled on this 
register, the Agencies have to fulfill specific requirements to attest 
their economical, juridical, and organizational solidity. 
The user can be any subject, non-entrepreneur included. For in-
stance, it might be a society, an entrepreneur, an association, or 
even Public Administration.
According to the task performed, the outsourced workers will be 
considered within the contractual level envisaged by the target 
CCNL. They can engage a broad range of different professional 
qualification levels (management, or more or less specialized jobs).
</p>
<p>b) ProhIbItIonS
</p>
<p>Subject to administrative sanction, it is forbidden appeal to out-
sourcing in the following cases:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; For the substitution of employees on strike;
&bull;&emsp; unless otherwise provided by trade union agreements, in the 
</p>
<p>production units affected by, in the previous six months, col-
lective redundancies (unless this contract was made to provi-
de for the replacement of absent employees, or is concluded 
for workers in mobility for not exceeding 12 months or that 
has an initial term non exceeding 3 months) or salary inte-
gration treatments;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; For the User&rsquo;s company that have failed in the risk assessment 
pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 81/08 on safety at work.
</p>
<p>lImItS
</p>
<p>National collective agreements negotiated by the more representa-
tive trade unions set the maximum number of outsourced workers 
(as a percentage of all workers) that the company can have.

<p>THE ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>this contract the User gets the professional service upon agreed 
payment that includes the outsourced worker&rsquo;s salary and contri-
butions, as well as a fee, to the Supplier, for research, training and 
bureaucratic management of workers.
The outsourcing contract must meet the following (formal) requi-
rements:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Written form; failing which the contract shall be considered 
void;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Essential contents (including number of outsourced workers; 
cases and reasons of technical, productive, organizational, or 
substitutive nature in the case of fixed-term outsourcing; the 
starting data and the expected duration; the workers tasks 
and their classification; the workplace, the working time, 
and the economic and regulatory treatment of work perfor-
mance; outsourcing Agency&rsquo;s commitment to directly pay 
the workers&rsquo; salary and contributions; User&rsquo;s commitment to 
repay to the Supplier wage and social security charges incur-
red by them in favor of the employers, etc.)
</p>
<p>Shall the Agency and the User agree in not considering the User 
obliged to hire the worker if there were any defect in the contract, 
that clause will be null and void (unless it provides the employee 
the recognition of an adequate allowance).
The outsourcing contract can be fixed-term or open-ended (the so 
called staff leasing). Both types of contract are subject to legal restri-
ctions to guarantee the worker&rsquo;s rights. In particular:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; regarding fixed-term outsourcing contract, as well as fixe-
d-term standard one, there is no longer need to specify the re-
asons that justify the limited duration. It is possible, though, 
to sign a fixed-term outsourcing contract without specifying 
a reason, in order to enhance its use in the economics world.
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; while regarding staff leasing, the law lists the circumstances 
(not mandatories, given that other ones can be provided 
by the collective bargaining) wherein its use is possible. For 
example, staff leasing is allowed in consulting and assistance 
services in the IT sector; cleaning services; transport of per-
sons or goods; libraries&rsquo;, parks&rsquo; and museums&rsquo; management; 
marketing activities; call-center management; etc.</p>

</p>
<p>cIvIlIty PenaltIeS related to defectS of form In the outSourcIng 
contract
</p>
<p>The employment contract, if any defect of form is present, must 
be converted into an open-ended employment contract directly 
managed by the User, who becomes the employer. In particular, 
this scenario occurs in the following situations:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; absence of the written form;
&bull;&emsp; lack of reasons justifying the fixed-term outsourcing contract 
</p>
<p>or out of the cases that justify recourse to the staff leasing
&bull;&emsp; where forbidden by law;
&bull;&emsp; absence of authorization from the Ministry of Labour;
&bull;&emsp; absence of any ministry clearance indication;
&bull;&emsp; in case of fraudulent outsourcing (i.e, having the explicit 
</p>
<p>purpose of evading imperative legal or collective bargaining 
norms applied to the employee)
</p>
<p>b) emPloyment contract and emPloyment relatIonShIP&rsquo;S reg-
ulatIon
</p>
<p>The employment contract is concluded between the employee 
and the Supplier. The law does not provide a specific framework 
for this employment contract, therefore the use of any kind of 
contract (open-ended and fixed-term employment contract, inter-
nship, job on call, etc.) and schedule (either full time or part time) 
could be possible.
In details:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Fixed-term employment contract: is regulated as any fixe-
d-term employment contract. It may be extended with the 
employee&rsquo;s agreement and in a written form if provided by 
the collective agreements applied by the Supplier.
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Open-term employment contract: during periods when the 
employee is not working but he is still available, he is entitled 
the right to an availability allowance, usually lower than the 
salary. This allowance, paid out by the Supplier, cannot be 
less than 350 and is divisible by hourly shares.
</p>
<p>The supplier has the power to dismiss, and the dismissal follows the 
ordinary rules, therefore varying according to the employment re-
lationship&rsquo;s duration (open-ended/fixed-term).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>THE ATYPICAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>Given that the Supplier is the formal employer, he is in charge of 
remuneration and contribution, as well as the exercise of the em-
ployer&rsquo;s authority. It is, however, a formal title considering that:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; regarding the employee&rsquo;s renumeration, social security and 
national insurance contributions, the User shall reimburse 
the Supplier;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; regarding the employer&rsquo;s authority, executive and control 
authority are up to the User, since the ones in a direct con-
tact with the employee at the workplace must exercise them. 
However, the Supplier is charged with disciplinary autho-
rity: the User is obliged to promptly notify the Provider of 
facts that could constitute a disciplinary offense.
</p>
<p>As far as it concerns the so called jus variandi (i.e the power to modi-
fy the employee&rsquo;s duties), it is exercised, to the extent permitted by 
the employment relationship (and therefore, pursuant to art. 2103 
cc, the worker can not be assigned to duties far below the ones he 
was hired for) by the User provided he gives immediate notice to 
the leasing agency. In case the User does not give immediate notice 
to the leasing agency, he has to pay the salary differences and the 
eventual compensation for the damages.
</p>
<p>economIc and legal treatment
</p>
<p>Article. 23 provides that the outsourced worker is entitled to an 
overall economic (salary) and legal treatment (trade union rights) 
not less than that of same level Users&rsquo; workers who perform similar 
tasks. 
Given that the law refers to an &ldquo;overall&rdquo; estimate, some differences 
on particular aspects (i.e. a single wage entry) may arise.</p>

<p>THE APPRENTICESHIP CONTRACT
</p>
<p>By gIulIa negrI
</p>
<p>The apprenticeship should be seen a main way to promote young 
people&rsquo;s entry into the labour market.
The internship (or on-the-job training), which has been recently in-
troduced, differs in many ways from the apprenticeship contract, 
primarily because (unlike the latter) it is not considered an em-
ployment contract but only a means to enable young people to 
make their first experiences in the working world.
On the other hand, the apprenticeship contract is a real open-ended 
employment contract designed to train and employe young peo-
ple. This is the reason why this type of contract is called a mixed 
one. Apart of renumeration, the employer has the legal obligation 
to provide the employee with the necessary professional training 
to acquire the professional specialization which corresponds to the 
employee&rsquo;s right to learn through a working activity.
It has a number of advantages both for the employer (as it provides 
him with the opportunity to directly train the professional figu-
res he needs, according to the requirements of the entrepreneurial 
activity he actually carries out, taking advantage of a facilitating 
regime in terms of salary and contributions and flexibility of the 
relationship) and the new employee (whom, in addition to the sa-
lary and social security payments related to any employment rela-
tionship, is also given a training program that allows him to obtain 
an official professional qualification)</p>

<p>legISlatIve SourceS
</p>
<p>The regulation of the apprenticeship contract is first provided by 
the articles 2130 &ndash; 2134 of the civil code (although it is referred to as 
internship), subsequently extended by law L. n. 25/1955.
In the following years, several modifications have been introdu-
ced, the most significant of which - as it has completely revised the 
apprenticeship discipline - being contained in the D Lgs. Septem-
ber10, 2003, n. 276 (the so called Biagi Law), art. 47-53: for the first 
time ever, three different kind of apprenticeships are introduced; 
this differ from each other based on the education and the qualifi-
cation system. This tripartite division has been maintained, as we 
will see later, even in the following reforms.
However, the rules that now govern the apprenticeship contract 
are contained in Legislative Decree no. 14 September 2011, n. 167, 
the so-called &ldquo;Consolidated Apprenticeship Act&rdquo;, which has simpli-
fied and brought together in a single regulatory body (composed 
of only seven items) the existing legislative stratification on the 
subject, expressly abrogating all previous rules.
Recently, even the Law no. 92/2012 (the so called &ldquo;Fornero Law&rdquo;), 
the Leg. Decree 76/2013, converted into Law 99/2013 and Law De-
cree no. 34/2014 converted into Law 78/2014 have intervened on 
the rules governing the apprenticeship contract.
In addition to the general provisions of the Consolidated Act, ap-
prenticeship supplementary provisions contained in national col-
lective agreements and legislation of the regional level (the latter, 
in particular, has been entrusted with the regulation of profiles spe-
cifically related to the disbursement of educational content) must 
always be checked.

</p>
<p>INTERNSHIP &ndash; ON-THE-JOB TRAINING
</p>
<p>By jeSSIca battaIa
</p>
<p>The internship (or on-the-job training) is a training and first entry 
into the workforce tool aimed at young people who have comple-
ted their compulsory education. 
Because of its training purpose the internship is not considered an 
employment relationship despite the fact that working activity is 
performed.
As a result, nor the requirements governing employment relation-
ship nor those governing self-employment are applied.
The internship can be used only for those work activities that re-
quire professional training and not to replace absent workers with 
a right to retain their position (sickness, maternity, leave), or to 
cope with peaks of activity or temporary needs in the establish-
ment.
Internship&rsquo;s discipline is entrusted to the Regions, on the basis of 
information provided by the guidelines laid down by the State-Re-
gions Conference, in implementation of the 1. n. 92/2012 (the so 
called Fornero reform). In the absence of specific regional, the rules 
of art. 18, l. n. 196/1997, as well as to D.M. n.142/1998 remain appli-
cable.
The internship involves three parties: the trainee, the promoter, 
and the host.
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The trainees: young people who have completed compulsory 
education (recent graduates) but also jobless/unemployed, 
disabled and disadvantaged persons.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> JESSICA BATTAIA
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The promoter: the subject - public or private - that connects 
the aspiring trainee with the employer - the host (eg. services 
and employment agencies, universities, schools); the promo-
ters guarantee the authenticity of the internship, thus, they 
have to be authorized by the national and regional law
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The host: the employer &ndash; public or private &ndash; that allows the 
actual conduct of the internship. In order to activate an in-
ternship the host must meet strict numerical requirements, 
be in compliance with the regulations governing health and 
safety at the workplace, not have imposed dismissals (except 
those for just cause and for justified subjective reasons) in 
the 12 months prior the training, nor have ongoing extraor-
dinary wage supplementation fund procedures concerning 
activities equivalent to those of the internship in the same 
unit.
</p>
<p>It is noted that the employer-host can not sign more than one in-
ternship contract with the same trainee.
The relationship between the parties is ruled by an agreement. The 
agreement is stipulated between the promoter and the host but it 
has to be known and signed by the trainee as well. The basic ele-
ments of the internship are written in the agreement:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Stage duration, that differs based on the subjects and the re-
gion;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The two tutors of the apprentice (one made available form 
the promoter and the other one from the host);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The expense where the minimum is indicated by the regio-
nal rules applicable, subject to the fact that the Guidelines 
have considered a gross amount of Euro 300.00 per month as 
a fair compensation;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the rights and obligations of the parties involved: in particu-
lar, compulsory insurance requirements paid by the promo-
ter (INAIL and civil liability against third parties).
</p>
<p>The training program (based on the models defined by the Regions) 
which describes the object and the methods of the internship must 
be attached to the agreement
It should be remembered that regarding curricular training, ie tho-
se performed under a defined path of study, there are specific pro-
visions at both national and regional level.</p>

</p>
<p>STUDY PERMITS &ndash; TRAINING LEAVE
</p>
<p>by jeSSIca battaIa
</p>
<p>In compliance with art. 34 Cost., which protects the right to study, 
different permissions, leaves, and benefits for study reason or edu-
cation are recognized to the workers.
The regulations governing study permits and training leave are 
outlined by art. 10 l. n. 300/1970, art. 13 l. n. 845/1978 and Articles. 5 
and 6 l. n. 53/2000.
However, the provisions provided by law must be integrated with 
the provisions contained in the collective agreements of the sector. 
It is necessary, therefore, to check the terms of the collective agree-
ment applicable to a specific employment relationship.
</p>
<p>PermItS for Study PurPoSe
</p>
<p>Permits for study purpose are intended for employed students, en-
rolled and attending regular courses of study in schools of primary, 
secondary and vocational qualification, state, equalized or legally 
recognized or otherwise qualified to issue legal qualifications.
In particular, the definition of hours paid (usually 150 hours in 
three years), the number of workers that can simultaneously enjoy 
the permissions in the same company, the terms and limits of use 
of the same permission are entrusted to the collective bargaining 
of a specific fields. Collective agreements may also provide additio-</p>

<p>WORK AND TRAINING
</p>
<p>59
</p>
<p>In order to obtain permits for study purpose, the worker must sub-
mit a written application according to the procedures and timing 
specified in the sectoral collective agreement , and if requested by 
the employer, certify his enrollment and attendance of courses. 
Under Art. 10, Law no. 300/1970, the workers are entitled to a range 
of benefits and in particular:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; To work in shifts that facilitate the attendance of courses 
and exam preparation;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; To be exempted from overtime during the weekly rest days;
&bull;&emsp; To make use of paid leave to attend the exams: the granting 
</p>
<p>of such permits is independent of both the time slot and the 
outcome of the exams.
</p>
<p>traInIng leave
</p>
<p>Employees with  at least 5 years of service with the same employer 
(private or public), can take advantage of training leave, ie periods 
of suspension of employment aimed to conclude compulsory edu-
cation, take an upper secondary educational qualification, diplo-
ma or university degree, or even participate in training activities 
other than those conducted or funded by the employer (art. 5, law 
no. 53/2000).
The leave request must be submitted to the employer with notice 
of at least 30 days and can be used for a maximum period of 11 
months (continuous or fractionated), throughout working lives. 
During this period the employee shall retain his working position 
but is not entitled to remuneration nor his length of service is ex-
tended.
Even in this case, the collective agreements establish the procedu-
res and timing for submitting the application, the assumptions of 
deferral or refusal by the employer to the exercise of this option, 
the mode of use of the leave and the maximum percentages of 
workers who can use them.
Further education leave, unlike training leave, as provided by art. 6, 
Law no. 53/2000, are intended for workers who wish to - by perso-
nal choice or business decision - follow vocational training courses.</p>

<p>INTERMITTENT EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
(ON-CALL EMPLOYMENT)
</p>
<p>By rIccardo bonato
</p>
<p>The job flexibility reaches its maximum with this particular con-
tract: on-call employees are on standby until called to work.
The on-call employment contract is divided in three types:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The employee is required to work when called 
upon.The on-call job contract must stipulate the monthly 
allowance to be paid to the worker during the period of his 
or her stand-by availability to the employer. The amount is 
to be fixed by collective agreements but may not be less than 
a level established and periodically updated by the Ministry 
of Labour and Social Policies, after consultation with the em-
ployers&rsquo; associations and trade unions. If the employee unrea-
sonably refuses to answer a call, the contract can be termina-
ted and (besides having to refund any perceived allowance) 
shall surely make restitution to the extent determined by the 
individual employment contract.
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The employee can decide whether to come to work </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> RICCARDO BONATO
</p>
<p>64
</p>
<p>when called upon. It is characterized by the fact of the 
on-call employee is not obliged to answer the call and no al-
lowance is payable for periods of inactivity.
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; on-call employment contract for limited periods 
of the year. The worker gives his availability in particular 
periods of the year (e.g. week-end, Christmas holidays, Easter 
holidays, or summer holidays) no allowance is payable for 
periods of inactivity. In case of unjustified failure to respond 
to the call of the worker, the contract is expected to be termi-
nated without paying any compensation.
</p>
<p>In all cases, according to the art. 34 Legislative Decree no. 276/2003, 
the intermittent employment contract can be concluded in two 
cases:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Related to work tasks with a non-continuos or intermittent 
character to be determined by collective bargaining at natio-
nal or local level, in specific periods of the week, month, or 
year (third category described);
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; For employees aged under 25 years old or over 45.
</p>
<p>ProhIbItIonS
</p>
<p>On-call worker cannot be used to replace workers on strike or if, 
during the previous 6 months, the company has initiated a collec-
tive redundancy procedure.
Recently, a new normative modification has been introduced in 
order to limit the use of this particular contract. In particular, D.L. 
76/2013 (the so called Work Package), with the inclusion of para-
graph 2a art. 34 Legislative Decree no. 276/2003, has determined 
that the use of intermittent employment contract shall be permit-
ted for each worker with the same employer, for a maximum of 
400 working days over three years. Upon successful completion of 
this period, the law provides for the contract to be converted into 
an open-ended employment one.

<p>both of the intermittent contract stipulated and the individual per-

The employee will be paid in proportion to the amount of hours 
worked and tasks performed, with a minimum hourly wage equal 
to that established by collective agreements for workers of the 
same level.

<p>Article. 38, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree 276/2003, establi-
shes a curious &ldquo;principle of non-discrimination&rdquo; for intermittent 
workers, therefore, during the periods of standby, they do not hold 
any of the rights granted to subordinated employees.
This means that illness, maternity and injuries are not recognized 
during those periods.</p>

<p>ANCILLARY LABOUR
</p>
<p>By gIulIa leonI
</p>
<p>Ancillary occasional labour is defined as an employment relation-
ship with the same customer not exceeding thirty days from the 
beginning of the year, whose total remuneration does not exceed 
5,000 euro (Legislative Decree no. 276/03, art . 61).
For a better understanding of the characteristics of the occasional 
employment contract, it is necessary to emphasize what differen-
tiates it from the project-based employment contract:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Lack of coordination with the activities of the client;
&bull;&emsp; Lack of integration in the company organization;
&bull;&emsp; Occasional nature of the activity;
&bull;&emsp; Complete autonomy of the worker regarding the time and 
</p>
<p>mode of the performance.
</p>
<p>It is not necessary nor to register for VAT or enrollment in a profes-
sional register: it is enough for the employee to issue an invoice for </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> GIULIA NEGRI
</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>occasional performance.
Regarding the contributory standpoint, subscribing in Inps separa-
te management fund is mandatory only for taxable income excee-
ding 5,000 euro: the occasional collaborators, therefore, are exempt 
from paying contributions.
The Legislative Decree 276/2003 has also introduced the occasio-
nal accessory work, thus defining all activities of an occasional na-
ture which do not lead, with reference to the totality of the buyers, 
in amounts exceeding 5,000 euro in a year, referring to activities 
performed occasionally and in an auxiliary position with respect 
to the main situation.
If the customer is an entrepreneur or self-employed, the remunera-
tion received can not exceed 2,000 euro.
The rules laid down in 2003, however, has undergone significant 
changes over the years. The objective and subjective requirements 
limiting its scope have now been removed; in fact the actual le-
gislation is applicable to all productive areas, all clients, and all 
workers.
The only parameter to be considered is the respect of the economic 
limit.
The one who offers occasional accessory work must notify the 
competent Employment Service or accredited Labour Agencies.
One the other hand, the individual or the organization that is plan-
ning to hire workers with this type of contract, will purchase from 
authorized retailers (usually INPS) the so-called &ldquo;vouchers&rdquo;, which 
he will give to the employee as remuneration.
The worker will get paid giving these voucher to the authorized 
offices and will receive back, for every voucher presented 7.50 eu-
ros, ie 10.00 euros minus 25% tax that includes: INPS Separate Ma-
nagement contributions (13%), INAIL contributions (7%) and the 
administration fee (5%).</p>

<p>MATERNITY LEAVE PROTECTION
</p>
<p>By roberto lama
</p>
<p>Pregnancy of an employee is an event that justifies the application 
of a series of protections, specifically provided for by the legislatu-
re in implementing the provisions of art. 37 paragraph 1 of the Con-
stitution which states: &ldquo;The Working women have the same rights 
and, for equal work, the same wages as working men. Working 
conditions must allow women to fulfill their essential role in the 
family and ensure the mother and the child a special appropriate 
protection.
The spirit and purpose underlying the provision of these protec-
tion instruments is twofold: it includes the need to safeguard the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> ROBERTO LAMA
</p>
<p>72
</p>
<p>worker&rsquo;s and unborn child&rsquo;s health, being this a potentially dan-
gerous event, as well as the need to avoid that the maternity leave 
causes the end of the business relationship due to the productivity 
drop.
What emerges from an analysis of Legislative Decree no. 151/2001 
(Consolidation Act on maternity leave) is that the working mother 
has a different level of protection whose greater or lesser intensity 
is related to the type of working relationship. It can be noted that 
maternity protection regulatory institutions are mainly provided 
with reference to the female employee with an open-ended em-
ployment contract.
In any case, the maternity leave protections provided in the Con-
solidation Act are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; paid time off for antenatal care
&bull;&emsp; protection against unfair dismissal;
&bull;&emsp; protection against unfair treatment or discrimination.
</p>
<p>First of all, the pregnant worker, form the conception up to the 7th 
months, cannot perform dangerous, exhausting, and/or unhealthy 
working activities (all. A e B.of the Consolidation Act) nor work the 
night shift (from 24 pm to 6 am). In the event that the woman nor-
mally performs this kind of activities, the employer is obligated to 
change her duties, notwithstanding art. 2103 cc, may be even lower 
than the original ones, without prejudice to the right of the worker 
to maintain the salary previously perceived. If duties equivalent to 
or less than those originally performed are not possible, the inspec-
tion service of the Ministry of Labour may suspend the employee 
on full pay for the entire period of gestation (art. 17 of the CA).
A period of mandatory maternity leave (art. 16 T.U) lasting 5 mon-
ths is provided by law. During this period the working activity of 
the working mother is forbidden an punishable by art. 18 of the 
CA. The maternity leave period covers: the two months before the 
expected date of confinement; the period between the expected 
date of confinement and the actual date; the three months fol-
lowing the confinement. An arrangement known as &ldquo;flexible ma-
ternity leave&rdquo; has recently been introduced: this allows the worker 
to put off her maternity leave until one month before the expec-
ted date of confinement and then continue it up to four months 
after the birth of her child.
Shall the woman present risk of serious outcomes and / or suffers 
from forms of disease, certified by the competent health care facili-</p>

<p>COMMON PROBLEMS 
</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>ties, capable of worsening the pregnancy (eg. toxoplasmosis, rubel-
la, hepatitis, etc.) the maternity leave can be anticipated.
During the period of maternity leave the worker is entitled to a 
maternity allowance from the INPS at 80% of the contractual wage 
rate on which national insurance contributions have been paid.
In case of death, serious illness of the mother or neglect, as well as 
in the case of sole custody of the child to the father, the latter has 
the right to take time off from work throughout the duration of 
maternity leave (art. 28 TU).
In pursuit of equally child care share between parents, the Law no. 
92/2012 has introduced a period of compulsory leave for the fa-
ther: within five months after the child&rsquo;s birth, the working father 
is obligated to take a day off from work that must coincide with 
a mother&rsquo;s day off. A period of optional leave of two days can be 
enjoyed even continuously, in substitution, and previously agreed 
with the mother.
During pregnancy a woman is entitled to get leave paid to perform 
antenatal cares (art. 14 of the Consolidation Act), provided that 
such checks are to be carried out during working hours. Until the 
first year of a child&rsquo;s life the worker is eligible for two daily rest pe-
riods for breastfeeding lasting one hour each, combined into one 
rest period of two hours. These leaves are fully paid (art. 39 of the 
Consolidation Act). Rest periods are half-hour when the worker be-
nefits from the nursery or (similar), established by the employer in 
the production unit or in the immediate vicinity of it. During the 
daily rests the worker has the right to leave the workplace.
In case of illness of the child aged less than three years, the parents 
are entitled to unpaid leave for a period equal to the duration of 
the illness of the child (art. 47 of the CA). For children aged between 
3 and 8 years, each parent can refrain from working, alternately, for 
a period not exceeding five working days per year.
During the first eight years of life of each child, each parent can 
enjoy, even fractionally, a period of leave (Parental leave) lasting 
up to six months (art. 32 of the CA). Altogether, the parental leave 
can not last more than 10 months. Parental leave entitles the per-
ception of an indemnity equal to 30% of the contractual wage.
The discipline described above applies to employee (at home, par-
t-time, domestic). Planned periods of compulsory leave and early 
leave, if necessary, apply even to those who have subscribed INPS 
separate management. Regarding project-based employees, in case 
of pregnancy, the unpaid suspension of the employment relation-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> ROBERTO LAMA
</p>
<p>74
</p>
<p>ship as well as an extension of 180 days apply. Regarding self-em-
ployed, the protections provided by the specific professional as-
sociations (art. 70 of the CA) apply; a period of compulsory leave 
lasting five months is in any case expected.
With regard to dismissal, it is expressly forbidden for the employer 
to dismiss the worker for the period between the date of conception 
of the child and the completion of one year of age of the child. 
Where the dismissal is imposed in violation of this prohibition, it 
is void and, consequently, devoid of any effect. Dismissal due to 
absence during maternity leave or child&rsquo;s illness is also forbidden.
Dismissal can only occur on grounds that have nothing to do with 
maternity, such as:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; negligence of the worker constituting just cause for dismis-
sal;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; expiry of the term of the contract;
&bull;&emsp; company&rsquo;s cessation, or one of its independent branch at 
</p>
<p>which the employee worked
&bull;&emsp; negative outcome of the test.
</p>
<p>Art. 56 of the Consolidation Act establishes that, after maternity le-
ave, employees are entitled to return to the same job in which they 
were employed before taking leave or in any other one located in 
the same town and remain there until the child is one year old. She 
has also the right to benefit from any improvement in working 
conditions introduced during the absence of collective bargaining 
or by law. This right to return to the same job must apply even in 
the case of enjoyment of leave periods other than the mandatory 
one.
Additionally, in order to tackle the so-called problem of blank resi-
gnations, the resignations and mutual termination agreements of 
parents with children under the age of three must always be vali-
dated and confirmed by such mothers or fathers through a special 
procedure. Failure to do so renders the resignation/mutual termi-
nation agreement ineffective.
Eventually, discriminations based on pregnancy when it comes to 
any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assign-
ments, promotions, layoff, training, fringe benefits, such as leave 
and health insurance, and any other term or condition of employ-
ment are forbidden</p>

<p>RESIGNATION
</p>
<p>by franceSca camPInI
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;resignation&rdquo; indicates the termination of the employ-
ment relationship by the worker. With the resignation, the worker 
expresses his will (normally, for the simple convenience to leave 
the workplace), and he can resign at any time, provided he gives 
reasonable notice, special cases (just cause, working parents, in the 
case of marriage with incentives) excluded.
From a regulatory standpoint, the resignation are contemplated in 
the art. 2118 of the Civil Code as one of the causes that may stop 
the employment relationship: the most conspicuous discipline is 
contained in. 92/12 (the so-called Fornero Reform) that, for the first </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> FRANCESCA CAMPINI
</p>
<p>76
</p>
<p>time, subordinates it to compliance with a specific procedure. This 
arrangement is, according to the legislature, intended to ensure 
that the withdrawing employee is genuinely willing to do so and 
is not pushed in this direction by the employer.
</p>
<p>1. requIrementS
</p>
<p>Voluntariness is the basic feature of resignation. In cases where 
the will of the worker has been in any way affected by an external 
event, resignation is invalid.
Should therefore be considered flawed and invalid, resignation de-
termined if:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the employer has followed a course of conduct deliberately 
aimed at coercing the employee to resign
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; worker&rsquo;s mistake falling on a rule of law (for example: the re-
signation of an employee who believes he has a fixed-term 
contract, while actually having a open-ended contract)
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; the inability of understanding and willing (eg. worker affec-
ted by bipolarity).
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; it is also possible that the employer and the employee agree 
for the employee to resign in exchange for an economic in-
centive (the &ldquo;voluntary redundancy&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>2. communIcatIon
</p>
<p>There is no obligation to resign in a particular form: resignation 
can therefore be submitted orally, in a written form or made im-
plicitly.
More specifically, the written form is prescribed by collective 
agreements and sometimes expressly referred in individual con-
tracts. In most cases, resignation is submitted with a letter signed 
and addressed to the employer or to the Human Resources Depart-
ment, provided with date, company&rsquo;s address or the one of any 
natural person whom it is addressed, the indication of the notice 
period and the last day of work. It is not mandatory to include per-
sonal motivations regarding resignation.
Resignation &ldquo;made implicitly&rdquo;, is referred to all those behaviors of 
the employee such as to explicitly and unequivocally externalize </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>COMMON PROBLEMS 
</p>
<p>77
</p>
<p>its intention to withdraw (eg. No unjustified refusal of transfer).
</p>
<p>3. the rISk of the So called &ldquo;blank reSIgnatIon&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The legislature, in order to discourage a widespread past practice 
(the employer used to extort the worker to sign an undated resi-
gnation letter, being in this way able to terminate the employment 
relationship without incurring the risks of a reckless dismissal), has 
introduced a special validation procedure (see below) the respect 
of which affects the effectiveness of the resignation (to formalize 
the will of the employee who intends to resign).
In addition, a blank letter of resignation is null and void and cannot 
be used by the employer to end an employment relationship. An 
administrative fine is imposed to the employer who uses it.
</p>
<p>4.valIdatIon Procedure
</p>
<p>The Fornero reform, in order to certify the authenticity of the will 
of the worker to withdraw, has introduced a new validation pro-
cedure of resignation making the simple communication of the 
resignation not adequate enough.
After submitting his resignation to the employer, the employee 
who wishes to terminate the relationship should,:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Validate it at the Territorial Labour Office or at the Employ-
ment Centre with territorial jurisdiction, or at other locations 
identified by collective agreements;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; Alternatively, sign a statement in the footnote of the resigna-
tion communication receipt.
</p>
<p>Failing the validation, the employer must send to the worker (wi-
thin 30 days from the resignation) a written invitation to provide 
for it. If the employer fails to do so or if the employee does not 
accept the invitation and does not validate the resignation within 
7 days, or if he withdraws the resignation (see below) the same is 
intended ineffective.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> FRANCESCA CAMPINI
</p>
<p>78
</p>
<p>5. reSIgnatIon effectS
</p>
<p>If the employee follows the validation procedure, the employ-
ment relationship ends (from the day of presentation not from the 
validation day). It is not necessary for the employer to accept the 
resignation.
During the validation period, the resignation is valid but tempo-
rary ineffective. 
Within seven days following the invitation of the employer to 
validate the resignation, the employee may withdraw them. The 
consequences of the withdrawal are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; The day following the revocation notice, the employment 
contract has a normal course again;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; If there was no work performance from withdrawal to revo-
cation, the worker doesn&rsquo;t build up any remuneration;
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp;  The revocation shall cease any effect of any agreement rela-
ted to the withdrawal and the employee is required to return 
all amounts received under these agreements.
</p>
<p>The invalid resignation is cancelled by the judge who orders the 
worker reintegration and any eventual compensation for the da-
mage.
</p>
<p>6. the advance notIce
</p>
<p>To prevent that the sudden resignation of the worker affects the 
conduct of the employer, it is necessary that these take action in 
respect of a period of notice determined by the collective agree-
ment or individual contracts. During this period, the parties keep 
all the rights and duties arising form the employment relationship 
(e.g. the worker can be fired for just cause).
The employee may, however, withdraw before the expiry of the 
notice period. In that case the employer withholds from the em-
ployee severance indemnities a compensation at an amount equal 
to that an employee would have earned as salary or wages if they 
worked through the whole notice period (payment in lieu of 
notice). Once the employee choses this option, he can not change 
his mind. On the other, the employer as well can refuse the prior 
notice by paying the indemnity in lieu of notice.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>COMMON PROBLEMS 
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>In the following cases, the employee is not required to comply 
with any term of notice:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; resignation for just cause
&bull;&emsp; working mother/father resignation
&bull;&emsp; at-will employment (e.g. during a trial period).
</p>
<p>7. reSIgnatIon for juSt cauSe
</p>
<p>According to the classical definition, just cause refers to: a breach 
of duty by the employer (i.e. a breach of the employment agree-
ment or the duty of fair and reasonable treatment) such that the 
employee feels he or she cannot continue the employment rela-
tionship, not even on a temporary basis.
As an example, the judges has recognized the just cause in the fol-
lowing:
</p>
<p>&bull;&emsp; repeated delays or failure in the payment of wages;
&bull;&emsp; Failure to pay the contributions
&bull;&emsp; Abusive behavior of the employer
&bull;&emsp; Illicit behavior
&bull;&emsp; Sexual harassment
&bull;&emsp; Mobbing
</p>
<p>Being the just cause a behavior particularly serious and not tolera-
ted, communication of resignation should be immediate. The de-
lay in the employee resign is justified only in exceptional cases and 
only for a short period of time.
The resignation for just cause gives to the employee the right to 
receive compensation in lieu of notice, but not compensation for 
the pecuniary damage induced by termination of the relationship. 
If, however, he suffered a non-pecuniary damage by virtue of the 
failure which led to the just cause of resignation, the worker can 
certainly claim damages.

The reasons that lead me to withdraw, ie (summary indication of the 
reasons), not allowing the continuation, even on a temporary basis, of 
the relationship are indeed a just cause for resignation.
Therefore, together with employee severance indemnities I kindly ask 
for the indemnity in lieu of notice to be granted.

<p>LAW N. 183 OF DECEMBER 10, 2014  
(&ldquo;JOBS ACT II&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>by SImone varva
 
</p>
<p>IntroductIon
</p>
<p>Through law No 183 of December 10, 2014, vigorously suppor-
ted by the President of the Italian Council of Ministers, Matteo 
Renzi, the Italian Cabinet intervenes once again on employment 
rules with the aim of creating a better, more fair labor market, 
following the flexicurity model (i.e. combining flexibility of em-
ployment with job security).
For the purposes of this paper, it will be sufficient to address the 
most important issues faced by young people. Given the enabling 
act nature of the aforementioned legislation, we will also refer to 
the first two legislative decrees; these legislative decrees, as we 
write, are still in draft, awaiting for the mandatory (but non-bin-
ding) opinions of the parliamentary committees in charge, before 
the actual entry into force which will take place on the day fol-
lowing its publication in the official bullettin. It would appear 
at present that any amendments that may affect these legislative 
decrees will not assume an importance such as to entail the com-
prehensive approach, however it will be necessary to ensure that 
the final version does not contain measures other than those cur-
rently contemplated.
From a schematic point of view, the enabling act, followed by a 
series of legislative decrees which will put into effect and imple-</p>

<p>UPDATES APPENDIX

</p>
<p>ment its principles and criteria, contemplates a series of signifi-
cant  measures of interest to young workers.
</p>
<p>oPen-ended contract of emPloyment WIth &ldquo;rISIng Protec-
tIonS&rdquo;
</p>
<p>A first innovation concerns the amendment to the regime of san-
ctions in case of unfair dismissal. Companies must pay a severance 
package, rather than reinstatement, a worker in case of &ldquo;wrongful 
dismissal&rdquo; (which is decided by a labor court). The size of the se-
verance will be based on the worker&rsquo;s years of employment with 
the company. It does away with the previous rule, in which fired 
workers who sue their former employers under Art. 18 have often 
been able to get the courts to have them get reinstated. The right of a 
new open-ended employee to be reinstated in the event of unfair di-
smissal will be limited to cases of unfair dismissal on discriminatory 
or disciplinary grounds. Reinstatement will no longer be available 
where the dismissal was based on business (economic) reasons.
Minimum severance package in case of unfair dismissal within 
companies employing more than fifteen employees in the same 
production unit, or more than sixty employees in total, is four 
months and is paid to workers up to two years of tenure; it is expec-
ted to increase of two months for each additional year of employ-
ment, up to a maximum of twenty-four months. This sanction is 
instead halved in case of vitiated dismissal under a formal or pro-
cedural point of view.
As far as it concerns production companies of smaller size, mini-
mum severance package in case of unfair dismissal is halved com-
pared to the aforementioned sanction regime and in any case not 
exceeding a maximum of six months.

<p>extended maternIty benefItS to female WorkerS and neW 
formS of Work - lIfe balance
</p>
<p>Law 183/2014 objectives include two important issues. The first 
one concerns new form of work - life balance; the second one, is fo-
cused on the introduction of new forms of parental protection. In 
particular, the act includes a number of new &ldquo;measures to protect </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> SIMONE VARA

</p>
<p>maternity leave and to promote work - life balance policies for the 
majority of workers.&rdquo;
The law provides extended maternity benefits to all female workers 
(also to those with a freelance work), introducing a tax credit to 
help mothers return to work, and promoting union agreements 
which encourage flexible working and working from home. The 
legislator is then called to introduce tax incentives to promote the 
work of women &ldquo;with minor or disabled children and those who 
find themselves below a certain threshold of overall individual in-
come&rdquo; and promoting union agreements which encourage flexible 
working and working from home. Concerning parental leave, the 
legislator is finally called upon to assess the current arrangements 
for the protection and support of motherhood and fatherhood &ldquo;in 
order to be able to evaluate the audit to ensure greater flexibility 
regarding mandatory parental leave and, promoting work - life ba-
lance policies, also taking into account the organizational features 
within the companies.&rdquo;
It should be noted that this legislative decree is quite broad in terms 
of political and discretionary content: it is therefore not possible to 
predict in which terms it will be implemented; however, the indica-
tion of the two contextual issues suggests that the encouragement 
and promotion of parenting should be mainly based on the expec-
tation of better chances of flexible working to all female workers (or, 
more broadly, to workers burden of parental care); as for the work 
&ndash; life balance, principles or guiding criteria are not to be found. 
</p>
<p>the neW unemPloyment benefItS (naSPI)
</p>
<p>The draft decree introduces a new form of unemployment bene-
fits in case involuntary loss of employment. The new unemploy-
ment benefit - whose Italian acronym is NASPI - will be available 
to anyone who paid into the national pension fund for at least 13 
weeks sometime in the past four years, and who can prove they 
were employed at least 18 days in the current year. At the same 
time, it eliminates the &ldquo;mini-ASPI&rdquo;.
In order to take advantage of the new benefits, the unemployment 
system requires workers to look for work and to be able and availa-
ble to work, should a job turn up.
The duration of the subsidy is directly proportional to the contri-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>bution period: every two weeks of contribution a week of unem-
ployment is matured. In any case, a maximum limit is provided, 
currently, established in about a year and a half (precisely seven-
ty-eight weeks, starting from 2017).
Pending the reform of the contract types,  &ldquo;para &ndash; subordinate&rdquo; (co-
ordinated and continuous or project) workers are provided with an 
experimental, specific service (called DIS - COLL), which reprodu-
ces (as far as compatible with the peculiarities of this contract) the 
NASPI&rsquo;s characteristics.
The system ends with an unemployment income support check 
(ASDI) which intervenes in case the unemployed subject runs out 
of the unemployment benefits and lives in extreme poverty (ac-
cording to the &ldquo;economic condition of need&rdquo; wording in the draft 
Decree).
</p>
<p>helP In fIndIng neW emPloyment
</p>
<p>One of the main objectives of the enabling act is the reorganising 
and strengthening of the national agency for employment po-
licy on the basis of European guidelines for maximising jobs and 
the &ldquo;flexicurity&rdquo; model (i.e. combining flexibility of employment 
with job security). A national employment agency will be set up, 
reinforcing pro active politics in order to bring a balance between 
supply and demand in the Italian workforce market.
In particular, an employee who is dismissed under the new rules 
will receive a voucher from his or her local governmental Job Cen-
tre in order to receive help in finding new employment from pri-
vate job agencies. The employee is required to cooperate with the 
Job Centre and provide a profile in order to facilitate his reintro-
duction to the work force.
The employment agency is called upon to take concrete and effec-
tive action, since it is possible to collect the voucher&rsquo;s value &ldquo;only 
in case of result.&rdquo; This measure, which political objective is clear, 
however, presents sensitive issues on how implementation will 
be performed, as there is the risk that agencies (especially private 
ones) are only activated in practice regarding professionalism and 
subjects attractive to the market (in order to collect the vouchers 
from the public authorities, as well as the employers&rsquo; compensa-
tion regarding the mediation activities).</p>
