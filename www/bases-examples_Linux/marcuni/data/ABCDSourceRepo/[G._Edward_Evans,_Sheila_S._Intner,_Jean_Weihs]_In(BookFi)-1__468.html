<p>It was more than thirty years ago when I and my co-author, Marty
Bloomberg, submitted the manuscript for what became the first edition of this
book. I bet Bloomberg a dinner at the best restaurant in Los Angeles that the
book would never sell more than 500 copies. Needless to say, I was wrong.
Looking back over the past thirty years and the previous six editions, it is clear
how much technical services have changed through the intervening years.
Readers familiar with earlier editions will quickly see that this seventh edition
includes changes that go far beyond new co-authors joining me in this work.
</p>
<p>The evolution of technical services during the past thirty years has been dra-
matic. With all of the public and professional press hype about the Internet, elec-
tronic services, and the &ldquo;Virtual Library,&rdquo; people tend to forget that it was in
technical services that the technology &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; got its start in libraries. The
paper-based type of catalogers and public catalogs led the way into the computer
world for most libraries. Representing a library&rsquo;s holdings, the bibliographic
database is still the heart of integrated library systems. That &ldquo;database,&rdquo; mani-
fested first in book form and then on card stock, and available today electroni-

And, it is technical services that provide both the key and the resources.
</p>
<p>This seventh edition has changed so much as to almost call for a new title.
All of the chapters have been rewritten. Sheila Intner and Jean Weihs, the new
co-authors, bring an outstanding background and publication record in the fields
of cataloging and classification. In addition, Jean provides the Canadian per-
spective to all aspects of the book, which is a first for this title. There are three
broad sections to this edition: Part One provides an overview of technical ser-
vices and current issues; Part Two explores the issues of the acquisition of mate-
rials for collections; and Part Three covers the work of preparing materials for
the end-users.

<p>Part One, General Background, consists of four chapters. The first is an
overview of technical services and the changing environment. Chapter 2 exam-
ines the various types of staffing that libraries use, particularly technical service
units, with a special focus on library technicians and other support staff. Admin-
istrative issues in technical service units is the subject of Chapter 3, and the im-
pact of cooperation and consortia on technical services constitutes Chapter 4.
</p>
<p>Part Two, Acquisitions and Serials, examines the acquisitions functions
of technical services, covering all types of formats&mdash;both print-based and digi-
tal. Chapters 5 through 14 in Part Two cover the activities and processes of the
unit, as well as the issues associated with the acquisition of each major type of
material.
</p>
<p>Part Three, Cataloging and Processing, comprises eight chapters beginning
with an overview in Chapter 15. The decisions that one must make in cataloging
are discussed in Chapter 16. How one goes about describing items in the collec-
tion is fundamental to end-users being able to locate desired materials, which is
covered in Chapter 17. Issues related to providing subject access are explored in
Chapter 18, while the formal headings used for subjects appear in Chapter 19.
The common classification systems used in the United States and Canada are de-
scribed in Chapter 20. Cooperation among technical services units within a
country and across national boundaries is dependent upon a variety of standards,
the most important of which is the MARC format. This topic is covered in Chap-
ter 21. The final chapter, 22, looks at the special management issues in catalog-
ing units.

<p>I welcome my new co-authors and look forward to years of collaboration on
yet future editions.

<p>Until recently, the vast majority of libraries divided their services and activ-
ities into two broad categories, technical services and public services. Technical
services traditionally handled those tasks associated with bringing materials into
the library and making them ready for the general public or service population to
use. Public services managed those activities that directly assisted the end-user
in gaining access to information in the library&rsquo;s collection as well as from other
collections. As discussed elsewhere in this chapter, that pattern is changing.
However, although the administrative structure is evolving, libraries still need to
acquire materials in some manner for the end-user and process the items, be they
paper or electronic-based.
</p>
<p>All libraries, regardless of type, perform nine basic functions to carry out
their information transfer activities:
</p>
<p>Identification: Locating potentially worthwhile items to add to the collec-
tion(s).
</p>
<p>Selection: Deciding which of the identified items to add to the collection(s).
</p>
<p>Acquisitions: Securing the items selected for the collection(s).
</p>
<p>Organization: Indexing and cataloging the items acquired in a manner that
will aid the end-user in locating materials in the collection(s).
</p>
<p>Preparation: Labeling and otherwise making the items ready for storage in
a manner that allows for easy retrieval.
</p>
<p>Storage: Housing the prepared items in units that take into consideration
the long-term preservation of the items while allowing staff and
end-users easy access to the material.
</p>
<p>�
</p>
<p>3</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Interpretation: Assisting end-users in locating appropriate materials that
meet the users&rsquo; needs.
</p>
<p>Utilization: Providing equipment and space to allow staff and end-users to
make effective use of the items in the collection(s).
</p>
<p>Dissemination: Establishing a system that allows for the use of items away
from the library.
</p>
<p>This book focuses on the first five activities; for information on the four remain-
ing activities, please see Introduction to Library Public Services.1

<p>The two broad traditional divisions within technical services are acquisi-
tions and cataloging. Within those two divisions larger libraries often have
sub-units such as serials, bindery/repair, copy cataloging, original cataloging,
and gifts and exchange. (No matter the size of the library, all of the items listed,
with the possible exception of original cataloging, do take place to some degree.)
The acquisitions section always handles securing materials. In many libraries,
it&rsquo;s also responsible for some of the identification of potentially useful materials,
if only by directing publishers&rsquo; catalogs and flyers to the appropriate deci-
sion-maker. Selection activity takes a variety of forms and depends on the type
of library and its size. In some cases the acquisition unit is the primary collection
development unit for the library. The cataloging section handles the other two
functional activities: organization and preparation.
</p>
<p>Acquisition activities also focus on securing items desired for the library&rsquo;s
end-users and handling the financial transactions associated with the purchase or
leasing of the item(s). Today most libraries acquire materials in a variety of for-
mats: print, electronic, and audiovisual. Those broad categories include a num-
ber of types of material such as books, journals, videocassettes, CD-ROMs,
electronic journals, and online databases. We explore the broad types of material
in subsequent chapters.
</p>
<p>Cataloging units provide the basic material upon which a library&rsquo;s service
program is built. They determine the appropriate form for identifying authorship
of works in the collection, describe the item as a physical item (or, increasingly,
a &ldquo;virtual source&rdquo;), and assign subject access points. They also add a classifi-
cation and author number to the physical items acquired; this &ldquo;call number&rdquo; al-
lows the public service staff to group materials on the same topic together in
storage units. Without cataloging it would be difficult at best for anyone to know
what was in the collection, much less how many items dealt with, say, geology.
What one sees in the public catalog is the result of the efforts of the cataloging
staff. (Although cataloging activities are essential for operating a successful
library/media center, this does not necessarily mean that there is a cataloging
unit in the library. For example, in 1993 Arnold Hirshon announced that the
Wright State University Library was closing its cataloging department and
</p>

<p>outsourcing all of its cataloging work to OCLC. He has since published a book
on the subject.2)
</p>
<p>
������������ ����#��$%�&amp;"�'

</p>
<p>Over the past fifty years there has been a steady shift in the philosophy
underlying technical services. Emphasis is increasingly being placed on the
end-user. Cataloging activities, which are the core element in providing access to
collections, are dependent on rules and codes that are complex and difficult for
non-catalogers to fully comprehend or use when seeking information. The codes
and rules are essential in providing consistency when organizing the collec-
tion(s). Acquisitions financial transactions are also dependent on a set of codes
and rules that are almost incomprehensible to anyone without a background in
accounting or bookkeeping. The previous approach was that these activities did
not require, need, or want much involvement with end-users. As late as the 1960s
and early 1970s a general opinion prevailed that the public catalog, the means
for determining the collections&rsquo; content, was a tool created by librarians for
librarians.
</p>
<p>Over time, and with a growing focus on attempting to understand
end-users&rsquo; information-seeking behavior and adjusting processes and proce-
dures to reflect that understanding, there were efforts to make technical services
outputs more &ldquo;user-friendly.&rdquo; An example of the shift in thinking is illustrated in
an article by Karen Drabenstott, Schelle Simcox, and Eileen Fenton3 reporting
the results of a study of end-user understanding of public catalog subject head-
ings. In their conclusion, they noted, &ldquo;It is time for the library community to
grapple with the difficult questions about its subject access system and make in-
formed decisions about solving the problem of low levels of end-user subject
heading understanding.&rdquo;4
</p>
<p>Libraries have tried a number of structures in the hope of breaking the
&ldquo;front room/back room&rdquo; view that prevailed in the past and that one may still en-
counter in some libraries. As early as 1948, Ray Swank argued that catalogers
and bibliographers were the key staff to create a collection that end-users would
find valuable.5 However, for a variety of reasons, he was ahead of existing prac-
tice and it was almost ten years before anyone attempted to implement some of
his ideas. In the late 1950s the University of Nebraska experimented with a sub-
ject approach to the provision of information. What this meant at Nebraska was
that librarians had a subject area responsibility for all the functions listed previ-
ously except preparation and storage.6 The idea that a person working directly
with the public is best able to understand the needs and behavior of users and
thus create collections and access tools tailored to local conditions is probably
correct.
</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, there are problems in applying the concept
in the real world. Individual librarians are neither all equally skilled nor inter-
ested in all the functional areas. In those cases functions of interest receive a
greater share of the person&rsquo;s time and effort, and less attention is given to those
</p>
<p>Technical Service Background and Philosophy 5</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>areas of least interest. Too great a variance causes substantial unevenness be-
tween subject collections and the quality of access to those collections. As Laura
Harper stated in a presentation at the 1998 midwinter meeting of the Academic
Technical Services Discussion Group (American Library Association) dealing
with the idea of blending public and technical service responsibilities, one can-
not force people to do what they cannot or do not want to do.7
</p>
<p>One of the most common methods for achieving some of the benefits of
Swank&rsquo;s and others&rsquo; ideas about blending the two traditionally distinct areas is
to have technical service librarians work some hours at the reference desk. Li-
braries employ different approaches to that idea, ranging from voluntary to re-
quired desk hours. At the University of Texas&ndash;Pan American campus, technical
service librarians were asked to work some desk hours.8 Such requests may, in
fact, be a directive; in other instances compliance is truly up to the individual.
However, when that request is generated by a library-wide reorganization plan
and/or staff reductions, it is likely that some of those receiving the request may
believe it would be impolitic not to &ldquo;volunteer.&rdquo; At the Loyola Marymount Uni-
versity (Los Angeles) Library two newly graduated catalog librarians asked if
they could have some reference desk hours at the time they were hired. Both be-
lieved working at the reference desk would help maintain their reference skills
and enhance their career options. Ten years later, they are still working at the ref-
erence desk and have not tested the career development idea; however, if one or
both were to leave, the head of public services probably would want to make
desk hours a part of the required duties for their successors.
</p>
<p>There can be significant advantages in terms of making better informed de-
cisions about access tools and for collection development from having technical
service librarians work in public services. However, there are some disadvan-
tages to consider before implementing such a plan. One is loss of productivity.
For example, for technical services personnel an hour spent on the reference
desk is an hour not spent on the &ldquo;real job.&rdquo; When there is a processing backlog,
the sense of what is &ldquo;real work&rdquo; becomes even stronger. Reference staff also lose
some productivity because they must train or update the reference skills of the
technical service librarians. When reference work drew solely on printed materi-
als this was not a major concern; today, with ever-increasing dependence on con-
stantly changing electronic resources, it can be a significant issue.
</p>
<p>Another issue is the quality of service that part-timers are able to provide,
especially if desk hours are required. The Loyola Marymount University (LMU)
Library recently conducted several faculty and student surveys regarding all as-
pects of library service as part of an assessment program in preparation for an
institution-wide accreditation visit. One of the surprise findings was that while
the reference staff service overall was very highly regarded by both students and
faculty, there were numerous written comments about those librarians who only
worked a few hours a week (none of the &ldquo;part-timers&rdquo; works more than four
hours). Comments indicated that although those individuals tried to help and
sometimes succeeded, the time required was high and the degree of confidence
in the results of the assistance was low. Essentially the users reported that they
would wait, if they could, for one of the &ldquo;regular librarians.&rdquo; The library staff is
attempting to develop a system that will give the part-timers a better opportunity
</p>
<p>6 1&mdash;Introduction and Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>to stay current with the changing menu of online services the library provides to
it users.
</p>
<p>A third issue is staff perception. When only technical service librarians are
asked to cross over (that is, reference staff are not asked to assist in technical ser-
vices), this sends a message about values&mdash;that of devaluing technical service
activities. With some administrative effort one can reduce the sense of devalua-
tion but seldom eliminate it.
</p>
<p>Another method for blending the two areas, not often used, is a modified
version of the subject approach. Sometimes this is referred to as &ldquo;matrix teams,&rdquo;
in which several people share a set of duties but allocate their time according to
their interest and skill levels. An example might be four persons who share ac-
quisitions, cataloging, reference, and collection development responsibilities for
the humanities. They might allocate their work time as illustrated in Table 1.1;
notice that both the rows and columns add up to 100 percent.
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Clearly, the benefit of this approach is a better use of skills, knowledge, and
interests of each team member. At the same time, team members gain a holistic
view of the library&rsquo;s activities and service programs, which in turn should result
in improved decision making, at least in terms of end-user needs. It is also clear
that a matrix team needs individuals who are not only committed to the concept
but also reasonably skilled in all the areas. That type of person is not always
available, and developing in-house interest and skills or seeking such breadth
during the hiring process takes time. Thus, this is not currently a model one sees
often.

</p>
<p>Three of the most prominent trends affecting technical services are technol-
ogy, budgetary issues, and outsourcing. We begin by discussing technology.
</p>
<p>Trends Affecting Technical Services 7</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Technology
</p>
<p>As mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, it was cataloging that
brought computers and networking into libraries on a large scale more than thirty
years ago. The integrated library systems (ILS)&mdash;computer systems and pro-
grams that automate various library operations and link them together in an al-
most seamless manner&mdash;that most libraries have today in one form or another
grew out of libraries&rsquo; efforts to provide cost-effective handling of acquisitions
and cataloging activities. During the 1960s, U.S. librarians engaged in a variety
of efforts to create cooperative or centralized technical service centers. Some
projects focused on a type of library, such as academic or public. Later efforts
focused on multi-type regional or statewide programs. Today we see the results
of those efforts in the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) and state and
regional &ldquo;networks&rdquo; that go well beyond technical service activities. We some-
times forget that the roots of these programs were in technical services. Few of us
who began our careers in technical services at the time fully understood where
these efforts would lead.
</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s ILS handle all of the traditional technical service functions. That
use of technology has both accelerated activities and improved consistency
throughout the library; perhaps the area where this is most evident is technical
services. For example, at the LMU library in 1987 there were four OCLC termi-
nals in the cataloging department and no other computers anywhere. There was
an acquisitions budget of just under $400,000, and the library processed (cata-
loged) between 3,500 and 4,000 items. By 1990 there was an ILS and computers
or terminals on about two-thirds of the staff desks. The acquisition budget was
just over $2 million, and processing exceeded 15,000 items per year in fiscal year
2000/2001. Although the dollar amount and processing increases may not be im-
pressive by themselves, what is impressive is that a staff that had declined by one
full-time equivalent (FTE) handled the larger workload in its entirety. It is also
noteworthy that the library did not employ outsourcing to handle the increased
processing. This was possible only by using technology, primarily the ILS.
</p>
<p>Productivity gains from an ILS come about in several ways. One of the
most significant arises from the ability to share files at the desktop throughout
the library. One of the great challenges for architects designing a new library
facility in pre-ILS days was that almost every staff member wanted to be adja-
cent to the card catalog to make the workday easier. Exacerbating those demands
was the fact that the end-users had to have access to the catalog. Obviously satis-
fying all of them was physically impossible, but the online public access catalog
(OPAC), a key element in an ILS, now makes it possible.
</p>
<p>Sharing files electronically reduces the amount of time staff have to spend
walking to and from their desks to shared physical files. Some of the shared files
for technical services include on-order, in-processing, serials check-in, shelflist,
and of course the public catalog. Both technical and public service staff require
access to information contained in such files; in pre-computer times, a substan-
tial amount of staff time was spent walking. Another problem was that some of
these files contained basically the same information, but arranged differently.
Creating and maintaining such files also required staff time, especially when
</p>
<p>8 1&mdash;Introduction and Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>there were hundreds, and often in large libraries, thousands of slips of paper. (A
traditional format in U.S. libraries was, and still is to some degree, a 3-by-5-inch
[ca 8-by-13-cm] card or paper slip.) Maintaining paper-based files was a chal-
lenge for every technical services unit. Misfiled slips were a constant issue and
could cost the library money. For example, if a book was already on order
but the order slip was in an incorrect location, a second unwanted copy might be
ordered.
</p>
<p>An ILS generally provides keyword searching of a variety of &ldquo;fields&rdquo; in the
electronic bibliographic record. (There is more information about fields and bib-
liographic records in Chapters 15, 16, and 21.) Keyword searches provide a more
complete view of collection holdings on a subject than does a straight subject
search. This is because such a search scans multiple fields such as title, subtitle,
and notes. When LMU first installed its ILS, many faculty members commented
that the number of titles they found when using a keyword approach to a search
surprised them. Such information is clearly something end-users like, and for
collection development staff it is also very useful.
</p>
<p>Many of the automation systems offer staff and end-users the opportunity
to &ldquo;browse&rdquo; the collection electronically. That is, they can see the bibliographic
record of each physical item in the collection in the order in which the material is
stored (the equivalent of the traditional shelflist). The advantage of electronic
browsing is that all items appear on the screen even if the item is checked out.
</p>
<p>One of the attractions of journals and newspapers is the currency of the in-
formation they contain. A frequently asked question in public service is, &ldquo;Has
the latest issue of XX arrived yet?&rdquo; In pre-ILS days such queries required either a
telephone call or a trip to the serials check-in file, usually located in technical
services, to provide the answer. Today most ILS will quickly provide the answer
at the location where the question is asked, and in some cases the end-user can
determine the answer directly from the OPAC. Even &ldquo;on-order&rdquo; information is
available to end-users in some systems, which is particularly useful in academic
institutions where faculty requests are important in building the collections.
</p>
<p>Another reason for increased productivity is that a single electronic record
can serve many purposes. With paper-based systems, technical services staff
often had to re-create the same information in a slightly different arrangement or
attempt to use multiple carbon copies of a form and then arrange files in the
desired order. Anyone who has worked with the multiple-copy order forms can
recall how faint the images were on the fourth, fifth, or sixth copy. Not having to
re-create records and having the computer rearrange information has freed up a
considerable amount of staff time. There is also greater consistency and accuracy
in the files, assuming the original entry was correct.
</p>
<p>Overall, the ILS has given libraries a strong incentive to review what, how,
and who does what. Technical services units have taken advantage of the oppor-
tunities and made numerous adjustments in their workflows and staffing patterns
(see Chapter 2, &ldquo;Staffing,&rdquo; and Chapter 5, &ldquo;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview&rdquo;). There is
every reason to believe that the ILS will continue to evolve and provide further
opportunities for improvements in productivity.
</p>
<p>Certainly the impact of technology now goes far beyond the ILS. The
Internet and the World Wide Web (the Web) have a substantial impact on library
</p>
<p>Trends Affecting Technical Services 9</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>activities. Vendors, especially those handling books or journals, are providing
more of their services through the Web. Following are two examples of ways in
which vendor Web services influence technical services. First, importing (down-
loading) OCLC bibliographic data has been a staple activity in libraries for many
years. What has changed and is changing is that it is becoming easier to down-
load files from vendors into the ILS and then modify the files to meet local needs.
In the not too distant past, the best one could expect was to make modifications
of files in the bibliographic utilities&rsquo; or vendor&rsquo;s database and then import the
file. The supplier also determined the amount of modification or manipulation
that could be made. In general, they allowed limited modification. Another
change is the ability to order materials and pay invoices electronically, which
makes for faster service and, assuming the electronic data are correct, fewer
errors. These and other electronic influences on technical services are covered in
Chapters 3 and 4.
</p>
<p>An important element in the area of electronic influences is metadata,
which is the generic term for cataloging and indexing for electronic documents.
Internet/Web sites are a mixed bag of information ranging from the worthless, or
even dangerous, to the authoritative. Libraries have been engaging in &ldquo;electronic
collection development&rdquo; for a number of years by attempting to sort out the good
from the bad and the ugly. Essentially, the idea is to identify worthwhile and reli-
able electronic resource sites and provide end-users with access to those sites. A
serious issue for libraries is how to go about describing such locations in the li-
brary&rsquo;s OPAC or on its Web page. Metadata (information about information) is a
term used to identify this concern. The Dublin Core is an example of an effort to
reach agreement on a standardized method for describing Internet/Web re-
sources.9 In July 2000 OCLC and hundreds of cooperating libraries launched the
Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC) project, a service that allows li-
braries around the world to retrieve and describe outstanding Internet resources.
</p>
<p>Electronic issues will be an ever-increasing factor for technical services.
Linda Bills provides an accurate assessment of some of the directions that librar-
ies will follow in this area:
</p>
<p>(1) Cooperation among vendors, often instigated by libraries,
</p>
<p>(2) Standards, either de facto or de jure for the exchange of var-
ious types of data, and
</p>
<p>(3) Re-allocation of responsibilities for various processes both
within libraries and between libraries and vendors.10
</p>
<p>Budgetary Issues
</p>
<p>Budget considerations have played a significant role in determining all
aspects of library services, not just technical services, over the past thirty years.
All of the usual economic and financial suspects appear on the following list of
influences:
</p>
<p>10 1&mdash;Introduction and Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Overall economic conditions,
</p>
<p>&bull; Reluctance of taxpayers to raise taxes (and in some cases rolling them
back),
</p>
<p>&bull; Shifting allocation priorities by funding authorities,
</p>
<p>&bull; Increasing collection material prices, far beyond that of overall inflation
rates, and
</p>
<p>&bull; Rapidly changing technology and the constant need to upgrade systems.
</p>
<p>From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, the economic conditions in dif-
ferent regions of the country varied, but overall it was a time of little real eco-
nomic growth. Phrases such as &ldquo;small is beautiful,&rdquo; &ldquo;less is more,&rdquo;
&ldquo;downsizing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;reengineering&rdquo; were commonplace and reflected the idea
that people and organizations could be more effective, often with fewer staff. For
libraries, the approaches represented by these expressions resulted in major
changes in services, staffing, and collections.
</p>
<p>Related to the overall economic conditions were taxpayers&rsquo; &ldquo;revolts&rdquo;
against tax increases in the United States. The notion that taxpayers could have a
major say in determining tax levels, both new and existing, started in California
and quickly spread across the country. These efforts had an impact on govern-
ment revenues, especially at the community and county levels. Libraries were
not very successful in securing voter support for bond issues that might provide
funds for new or remodeled buildings or increases in the level of base support. In
a few extreme cases, the lack of support led to the closure of the library. An ex-
ample is the closing of the Shasta County (California) operated libraries in
1987.11 (Citations to other examples of library misfortunes appear in the Sug-
gested Reading section of this chapter.) Libraries in other countries do not raise
money through bond issues but rather are funded directly by governments. Tax-
payers everywhere in the United States are reluctant to have increased taxation,
and politicians are anxious not to alienate voters, with the result that libraries in
many jurisdictions are not generously supported.
</p>
<p>Government officials understood that voters wanted certain services main-
tained. Police, fire, sanitation, and road maintenance services were high priori-
ties. Services such as schools, libraries, museums, and parks had to struggle for a
share of the small amount of funding that remained after top priority services
were almost fully funded. Often the best a library could hope for was funding at
the same level as the previous year. With inflation, at times even the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) was in the double-digit range, and &ldquo;last year&rsquo;s funding&rdquo; did not
go as far in each succeeding year.
</p>
<p>During those years, and to some extent continuing up to the time we pre-
pared this chapter, the cost of materials for the library&rsquo;s collection increased at
rates that were even higher than the CPI. Journal prices in particular escalated
rapidly. The magnitude of the problem is illustrated by some late 1990s data
about serial prices for libraries. For public libraries in 1995 the average price of a
journal was U.S. $52.59; by 1999 the average was U.S. $62.98 (a 19.45 percent
increase in five years), and these were considered by many librarians to be the
&ldquo;good times.&rdquo; In the case of academic libraries, the situation was grim: The 1995
</p>
<p>Trends Affecting Technical Services 11</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>average price was U.S. $282.51, and by 1999 it was U.S. $419.22 (a jump of
48.39 percent).12 (Journal prices vary in large measure by the size of the potential
market for a given title. Popular titles, with millions of potential subscribers,
have relatively low prices, whereas low-interest titles, with a few thousand sub-
scribers, have high prices. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 10). Book
and media prices were also increasing faster than the CPI throughout much of
this period.
</p>
<p>While addressing these challenges, libraries also faced the need to first in-
stall a variety of technologies and then maintain them at an appropriate level, if
the library was to remain a viable player in the new &ldquo;Information Society.&rdquo; Tech-
nology changes rapidly, and it is often impossible not to move forward with
those changes if one hopes to receive support for the technology. Upgrading al-
ways seems to cost more than expected, which puts an additional strain on the
budget.
</p>
<p>All of these factors, and others, created an environment in which libraries
faced difficult financial and service choices. Initially, some libraries thought
reducing service hours might generate a demand from end-users to funding
authorities for increased funding to restore service levels. This seldom was the
outcome, and circumstances did not improve. Another approach that almost
every library tried was to change or reduce its collection-building activities. One
change was to reduce one-time purchases&mdash;books and media formats&mdash;to main-
tain current journal subscriptions. However, year after year of double-digit price
increases for serials forced many libraries to engage in serial cancellation projects
and also try to increase book purchases as those collections began showing seri-
ous signs of aging.
</p>
<p>One of the other frequently seen outcomes of the overall reduction or mini-
mal growth in the library budget was changes in staffing patterns. Sometimes
this took the form of hiring &ldquo;freezes&rdquo; (not being allowed to fill a staff vacancy)
for long periods of time. At other times it involved losing a position when a staff
member resigned (staff attrition). Occasionally, it was outright staff reductions
through voluntary or involuntary terminations (called &ldquo;reductions in force,&rdquo;
&ldquo;riffing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; depending on location). Not surprisingly, having
fewer one-time purchases to make and fewer serial titles to process, as well as
seeing an overall drop in the number of materials to catalog, meant technical ser-
vices had staffing and workload issues to face and greater pressure to reduce its
staff. It also meant that there was pressure to look at alternative methods for han-
dling the workload. One such method is outsourcing.
</p>
<p>Outsourcing
</p>
<p>Outsourcing means having some service or activity performed by persons
or organizations (&ldquo;third parties&rdquo;) that are not part of a library or library system.
When looking at the professional literature of the past ten years for discussions
about the concept, a newcomer to the field might believe that outsourcing is a
new phenomenon in libraries. That impression is only partially correct. Techni-
cal services units have been outsourcing activities for a great many years: using
jobbers for ordering books rather than purchasing directly from the publisher;
</p>
<p>12 1&mdash;Introduction and Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>using serial vendors to place the bulk of subscriptions rather than going directly
to the publishers; and using outside companies to bind and repair materials for
the collection. Somewhat new are efforts to use outside agencies for collection
building and even overall library operations. In the case of overall operations,
U.S. government agencies have used such services for their library programs for
many years, just as have some corporations.
</p>
<p>The current emphasis on outsourcing started in the for-profit sector at the
same time that topics such as reengineering and downsizing were popular. Like
libraries, businesses had employed the concept for many years without media at-
tention. The difference in coverage was that the idea was often linked with staff
reductions. Another term that came into play at the time was contingent
workforce. Anne Polivka and Thomas Nardone defined this concept as
</p>
<p>a wide range of employment practices, including part-time
work, temporary work, employee leasing, self-employment,
contracting out, and home-based work. As a result, the opera-
tional definition of a contingent job has become an arrange-
ment that differs from full-time, permanent, wage, and salary
employment.13
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contracting out&rdquo; is a synonym for outsourcing. Karen Jette and
Clay-Edward Dixon discussed contingent work in libraries in an article in Li-
brary Administration &amp; Management, noting that libraries have also employed
that concept for many years.14 Their article has a sound section on the pros and
cons of such work, including outsourcing.
</p>
<p>In an excellent article addressing some of the management issues related to
outsourcing, James Marcum reviewed both management and library literature on
the subject; this article is a good starting place for those considering
outsourcing.15 One of his points is especially noteworthy: &ldquo;To the extent that
outsourcing is a stand-in for downsizing, it is an act of a desperate management
seeking short-term survival and not a strategy of implementing a transformation
for the future.&rdquo;16 Although Marcum&rsquo;s focus is on the general concept rather than
its application to technical services, the issues he raises apply to any aspect of
library outsourcing.
</p>
<p>As a cost-reduction tactic, outsourcing may be correct and effective in the
short run but may have unexpected long-term consequences. No matter what one
does, certain coordination costs will always be present. Reducing those coordi-
nation and monitoring costs results in long-term quality control issues. Expertise
that will be needed later may also be lost, and the cost of re-securing that exper-
tise can be high. There may also be unexpected salary implications, if the activity
outsourced involves staffing changes. What happened in the Hawaii State Li-
brary system is a good example of the unexpected outcomes of outsourcing when
the focus is on cost reduction.17 The director/state librarian outsourced selection
to Baker &amp; Taylor, a vendor. Resulting collections were not satisfactory and the
public outcry caused the contract to be rescinded. Lawsuits were filed by both
the state against the vendor and the vendor against the state.
</p>
<p>Trends Affecting Technical Services 13</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Despite these drawbacks, there is substantial potential for using
outsourcing as another tool for helping to control costs or supplement and ex-
pand services. This is how libraries have effectively employed the concept in the
past without labeling it &ldquo;outsourcing.&rdquo; Two examples from acquisitions and one
from cataloging illustrate the point that outsourcing has a long tradition in librar-
ies. As mentioned previously, using either, or in most instances both, a book or a
serials jobber is not absolutely essential for libraries. A library could place all its
orders for books or journals directly with the publishers. For very small libraries
that may be a reasonable option. However, as the volume of orders increases the
work involved in maintaining address files, credit terms, discount information,
and so forth from hundreds or even thousands of publishers becomes prohibitive.
Years ago, acquisitions librarians saw the value of placing a single order with a
jobber or wholesaler for the items needed from various publishers. (Placing one
order for 100 books from thirty-five different publishers instead of thirty-five
orders with the individual publishers saves staff time in order preparation alone.)
The idea was not to reduce staff or cut costs; it was to make the most effective use
of existing staff and keep costs from increasing.
</p>
<p>Another example, and one that is not often mentioned as outsourcing, is the
use of approval plans in academic libraries. In these plans, the vendor identifies
items that match a list of subject areas that the library wants to collect and ships
various materials that fall into the category to the library for review. Thus, the li-
brary outsources the identification function, one of the basic functions discussed
previously in this chapter.
</p>
<p>Cataloging departments have an equally long, if not longer, history of using
outsourcing. For example, until widespread implementation of the ILS took
place most libraries made extensive use of catalog cards produced by commer-
cial companies and the Library of Congress. (LC started selling its cards around
1901.) Certainly there was even greater use of the National Union Catalog
(NUC) and Canadiana in creating cards for public catalogs. (One of this book&rsquo;s
authors well remembers his days as a cataloger with the responsibility of over-
seeing the duplication of LC/NUC and local copy for use in the library&rsquo;s public
catalog and shelflist.) No one thought of this as outsourcing; at best it may have
been regarded as resource sharing (although libraries were depending on &ldquo;third
parties&rdquo; to provide the product and did pay for the services and cards).
</p>
<p>By the 1960s there were efforts to create shared processing centers. As
noted previously, these efforts resulted in bibliographic utilities such as OCLC
(Online Computer Library Center). This form of outsourcing is an accepted and
very valuable service.
</p>
<p>A common first response to suggestions of using outsourcing for a library
activity, especially cataloging, is the lack of quality control on the part of third
parties. Local catalogers are known to &ldquo;correct mistakes&rdquo; made by the Library of
Congress, and many have grave doubts that bibliographic records from other
libraries can possibly be as accurate as ones produced in-house. Obviously
doubts about a third-party source (another library or one that is for-profit) are
even greater. As Sheila Intner has noted, the goal of the perfect catalog record
and perfect public catalog is akin to seeking the Holy Grail&mdash;a worthy idea but,
at least in the case of cataloging, highly unrealistic and costly in many ways for
</p>
<p>14 1&mdash;Introduction and Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the library.18 Certainly there are quality concerns, but they exist no matter where
the work is done or by whom, and the reality is that perfection is highly unlikely
to exist anywhere at reasonable cost to the library and end-users. Quality of
third-party work therefore should not be a limiting factor in deciding to move
ahead with an outsourcing project; it should just be one of many issues that must
be addressed.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most ambitious effort at outsourcing technical services is that
taking place at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU). FGCU is the newest uni-
versity in the Florida university system; it opened in late 1997. FGCU&rsquo;s
outsourcing project consists of five major technical service activities:
</p>
<p>&bull; The retrospective conversion and reclassification of a collection of
65,000 volumes purchased from a college that had closed. This also in-
cluded the physical processing of the volumes.
</p>
<p>&bull; The selection and processing of 35,000 volumes from a collection of
160,000 volumes that were part of the library collections at two Florida
academic institutions.
</p>
<p>&bull; The merging and de-duplication of the two retrospective collections and
the creation of a retrospective purchasing list for the balance of an &ldquo;open-
ing day&rdquo; collection.
</p>
<p>&bull; The creation of an opening day collection consisting of 130,000 volumes,
fully processed and shelf ready, with bibliographic records for all items
in both OCLC and the Florida Center for Library Automation database.
</p>
<p>&bull; The creation of a fund accounting system for the collection.
</p>
<p>The primary vendors of the services were OCLC and Academic Book Cen-
ter (now part of Blackwell North America). At press time it was still too early to
predict the outcome of the efforts at handling essentially all of the library&rsquo;s tech-
nical services by third parties. However, it does seem to be more successful than
the aforementioned Hawaiian efforts, perhaps because this is a start-up situation
and there were no vested interests in &ldquo;how we did it better.&rdquo; Another factor that
has made this effort less controversial than the Hawaiian project is that the selec-
tion activities are based on collections from previously established academic li-
braries. Thus there is a sense that the titles were vetted by librarians at an earlier
time.
</p>

</p>
<p>Technical services provide both information resources that end-users need
and the means of gaining effective and efficient access to those materials. Tech-
nology has played an ever-greater role in changing the way in which technical
services operate but has not changed their basic functions. In addition to technol-
ogy, general economic conditions also have had a significant impact on the ac-
tivities performed. One of the most notable of those effects is a growing
emphasis on outsourcing.

</p>
<p>Staffing
</p>
<p>Clearly a library without staff would indeed be &ldquo;virtual&rdquo;; however, more
often than not its end-users would be unable to locate the precise information
they need. Even the so-called virtual organizations require people power. Any-
one who has used an online service, no matter how intuitive it supposedly is,
knows there are always a few questions that need answering, preferably by a
knowledgeable human being. In terms of technical services, there will always be
a need for individuals who understand and can handle the basic technical service
functions discussed in Chapter 1. Outsourcing of technical service activities may
mean that a person does not work for an individual library but rather works for an
organization that supplies technical services to a number of libraries. Whether
someone works for a library or for a technical service outsourcing organization,
the skills and knowledge required are the same. This chapter explores a number
of staffing and personnel issues as they affect technical service activities.
</p>
<p>��#���)�(���&amp;�������
�%&amp;����
</p>
<p>End-users of libraries generally view anyone working in the library as a
&ldquo;librarian.&rdquo; Actually libraries, like most other organizations, utilize several cate-
gories of employees. The labels for the categories vary from library to library;
however, there are three basic groups:
</p>
<p>&bull; Full-time individuals who have a master&rsquo;s degree in library and informa-
tion science and/or a subject graduate degree (librarians/profession-
als/subject specialists),
</p>
<p>&bull; Full-time individuals with degrees ranging from high school to
post-graduate (paraprofessional, nonprofessional, support staff, library
assistant, technical assistant, library media technical assistant, and cleri-
cal staff are some of the more common titles), and
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>�</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Part-time individuals with or without a degree (pages, shelvers, interns,
student assistants, volunteers).
</p>
<p>Large research and academic libraries often have full-time staff who have
graduate degrees in subject areas that are of primary interest to the library; often
these are doctoral degrees. Other professionals who do not have library degrees
also work in large libraries (for example, personnel officers and networking spe-
cialists). Although the end-user seldom recognizes, and may not understand or
care about, these variations, such differences do matter to library staff.
</p>
<p>Starting in the 1960s, an ever-increasing volume of literature examined the
question of library staffing categories, job titles, job duties, and related issues.
Two of this book&rsquo;s authors have been writing about these issues for a much lon-
ger period. The interest in the topic has grown substantially since the 1970s. Part
of the reason for the increasing coverage arises from the factors discussed in
Chapter 1 relating to the changing nature of library activities. To a large degree
what has been taking place is summed up in a statement by Michael Gorman:
&ldquo;No librarian should do a job a paraprofessional can do, no paraprofessional
should do a job that a clerical staff member can do, and no human being should
do a job a machine can do.&rdquo;1 Budget reductions, downsizing, technology, and
changing staffing patterns all create an environment of uncertainty, tension, and
often fear. Add to that mix variable beliefs or understandings about the types of
work and who should do what, when, and how, and there are bound to be con-
cerns about employment security and what jobs will exist in the future as well as
the labels associated with those positions. Liz Lane and Barbara Stewart have
correctly noted that &ldquo;many staff members are being assigned higher-level work
which then require an upward reclassification of jobs in the automated technical
services environment. Work previously done at lower levels has either become
automated, outsourced to a library vendor, or is not done anymore.&rdquo;2
</p>
<p>As Paula Kaufman wrote some years ago, the categories used to classify li-
brary employees &ldquo;can create problems, tensions, and conflicts between library
nonprofessional and professional staffs.&rdquo;3 (These tensions, at least in technical
services, go back to at least the mid-1960s and the movement to create computer-
ized processing centers.) Brian Nettleford addressed some of the key issues
when he looked at the relationship between staff performing &ldquo;professional&rdquo; ac-
tivities and those performing other library activities.4 Nettleford defined librari-
ans as individuals who act &ldquo;as planners, administrators, or practitioners of
librarianship, and have the ability to analyze information in depth and with per-
spective, based on an appreciation of the role of the library as a service organiza-
tion.&rdquo;5 He defined paraprofessionals as individuals who have &ldquo;the knowledge,
use, and understanding of a range of specific techniques, procedures, and ser-
vices that can be undertaken according to a set of predetermined rules, without
the need to exercise professional judgment in decision-making.&rdquo;6
</p>
<p>Labels carry different meanings to different people and can have implica-
tions for overall organizational morale. Using the term nonprofessional is likely
to cause some tension, especially among those who are part of that group. Terms
such as support staff, library assistant, and technical assistant cause less tension
</p>
<p>Library Personnel Categories 21</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>but are not universally appreciated by those so labeled. The term used in this
book is paraprofessional because it is widely used in other fields as well.
</p>
<p>Five broad categories of library employees are covered in this chapter: the
three mentioned previously as well as clerical staff (for positions that call for
basic office skills, such as keyboarding and filing abilities) and volunteers. The
terms professional, paraprofessional, clerical, part-time staff, and volunteer are
used for these categories. Because the issues of professional background and
skills are widely discussed in library literature, little space is devoted to it here.
The primary focus is on the other categories; however, all five categories of em-
ployee play important roles in technical service programs.
</p>
<p>Professional Staff
</p>
<p>When the first edition of this textbook appeared (1970), graduates of library
schools had at least a basic understanding of cataloging, classification, and col-
lection development. Library schools of the time had a &ldquo;core curriculum&rdquo; that in-
cluded at least one course in each of these subjects. That type of background
permitted libraries to experiment with organizational structures cutting across
technical and public services, such as those mentioned in Chapter 1.
</p>
<p>During the intervening years library schools, like libraries, have encoun-
tered a changing social environment that required significant responses. Like
some libraries, a few schools closed; others reduced their size or focused on one
or two types of libraries. Some of the schools shifted their focus to a generic &ldquo;in-
formation&rdquo; curriculum in an attempt to broaden employment opportunities for
their graduates as well as reflecting an external environment that emphasizes in-
formation and technology. Several have gone so far as to drop the word &ldquo;library&rdquo;
from the school&rsquo;s name. Name changes and changing curriculum needs led to
revised &ldquo;core requirements,&rdquo; as few schools in the United States were willing to
expand their programs beyond one year in length. The result has been that fewer
and fewer graduates have a background in cataloging, classification, and collec-
tion development at a level that was once typical. Most schools still offer course
work in these areas, but as electives rather than as requirements.
</p>
<p>It is therefore not surprising to see articles such as Janet Hill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Why Are
There So Few of Us? Educating Librarians for Technical Services,&rdquo;7 in which
she stated that
</p>
<p>Another wrong message is sent by the curriculum itself. Once
cataloging and technical services topics occupied about half of
the curriculum . . . no librarian got out of library school without
knowing how to catalog at least at some level. As other subjects
have needed to be accommodated, however, bibliographic con-
trol and technical services have been pinched and squeezed and
shaved so that they now represent only a small portion of the
course offerings . . . [which] carries the message that the techni-
cal services functions are of little importance.8
</p>
<p>22 2&mdash;Staffing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We believe that there is a message in the new curricula. However, perhaps
that message is less that technical services are unimportant and more that em-
ployers are, or should be, able to provide training in these functions. Essentially
this boils down to the long-standing debate about library education: Should it be
theory- or practice-based, for &ldquo;day one skills&rdquo; or &ldquo;career skills,&rdquo; and can every-
thing fit into the existing time frame for the course of study? There is an
ever-growing tendency for the employers of new graduates to provide more and
more of the training needed for success in beginning positions. This adds yet an-
other task to the load on staff members who are usually stretched almost to their
limit.
</p>
<p>Historically, acquisitions departments have employed a limited number of
librarians unless the department has collection development responsibilities. To-
day, a single professional usually fills the department head position in most
small, medium-sized, and even a few large libraries. The balance of the depart-
mental staff usually consists of a combination of paraprofessionals, clerical, and
some part-time personnel. Traditionally, if there was a separate serials depart-
ment, the department head was a professional. Today that is also changing, at
least in medium-sized academic libraries, and the position, if it exists at all, is
held by a paraprofessional.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the challenge of professional staffing in technical ser-
vices, particularly for acquisitions and serials work, is that in the past individuals
developed an interest in these areas as a result of working under the direction of
an experienced librarian. With fewer professionals working in these depart-
ments, where will libraries be able to find librarians with the necessary back-
ground to head up the departments? (Ed Evans wonders and worries about what
will happen when the LMU library&rsquo;s head of acquisitions and serials decides to
retire. Both joke about making a written pact that they will retire at the same time
to prevent either of them having &ldquo;to break-in a new person.&rdquo; This is only partly a
joking matter, at least for the director, as finding a new professional to fill the
department head position would in all likelihood mean attracting an experienced
person from another library. Doing that will become increasingly difficult and
costly as the pool of suitably experienced candidates shrinks.) Why the issue is
more significant for acquisitions and serials work is that even in the past these
topics were often only a subset within a course on collection development in li-
brary schools. Very few schools had full courses on acquisitions work; more had
or have a full course on serials, but enrollment in such courses apparently is
small. Becoming a professional in acquisitions or serials work is a matter of
on-the-job training and self-teaching.
</p>
<p>Lisa German and Karen Schmidt summed up the current education situa-
tion for librarians in the area of acquisitions, and their comments are applicable
to serials work:
</p>
<p>At present there are sporadic instances of library schools in the
United States offering acquisitions courses, but it is more com-
monplace for acquisitions to be included in technical services
courses that may or may not include the administrative details
</p>
<p>Library Personnel Categories 23</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>that make for successful acquisition procedures. . . . The de-
tailed and more clerical aspects of acquisitions are being codi-
fied by computer systems, but the framework of theory and
knowledge upon which these skills hang is lost.&rdquo;9
</p>
<p>In the area of cataloging the challenges are only slightly less daunting. Al-
though almost every library school offers full courses on cataloging and classifi-
cation, they may be electives rather than requirements. Yes, most of the schools
have a required course that covers the theories and concepts related to organizing
knowledge, and certainly cataloging and classification is a subset of that field of
study, but such courses seldom focus on the real world aspects of how libraries
currently organize their collections. For students to learn about these issues they
must take one or more electives covering such topics. Not many students make
that choice. One of the factors contributing to the lack of interest in the field is
that schools are placing little emphasis on the topics as central to a career choice.
</p>
<p>Paraprofessional Staff
</p>
<p>Paraprofessional and clerical staffs are often difficult to differentiate in
some libraries. Unionized libraries have clearer staff divisions that everyone on
the staff understands, even if those divisions are not readily apparent to end-users.
There is also what some people perceive as overlap between paraprofessional
and professional staff. During the first half of the twentieth century, libraries had
three very clear categories of staff: librarians, clerks, and pages. Starting shortly
after the end of World War II, a steady blurring of those categories has taken
place, and the number of categories has increased. Several factors combined to
initiate this process.
</p>
<p>The post&ndash;World War II period was a time of expansion in North American
society, in communities, institutions, and education. Home ownership grew as
developers built housing tracts or even created entirely new communities near
large urban centers to meet the housing needs of returning veterans and war
workers. With the development of &ldquo;suburbia,&rdquo; urban-area public libraries built
new branches to serve these communities. Some new communities created their
own public library systems when they incorporated as independent political enti-
ties. Higher education also went through a &ldquo;boom&rdquo; period from the 1950s to the
early 1970s as a result of government actions. National legislation allowed veter-
ans to go to college at government expense. The number of students exceeded
the capacity of existing institutions despite the construction of new classrooms
and student housing. This resulted in the establishment of new colleges and uni-
versities and, of course, new libraries to support these institutions. There was an
expansion of primary and secondary schools and growth in school library/media
centers. The new and expanding libraries needed more librarians than existing
library schools could supply, and people began to look at librarians&rsquo; activities
and ask who else could do the work.
</p>
<p>This was also a period of very large budgets for collection building, which
in turn resulted in a huge increase in acquisitions and cataloging work. At the
time the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; methods for handling the workflow resulted in acquisitions
</p>
<p>24 2&mdash;Staffing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>departments ordering and receiving much higher levels of new materials than
catalog departments could process. The outcome was a &ldquo;cataloging backlog,&rdquo; at
least in most academic institutions. Ed Evans&rsquo;s experience as a cataloger took
place just as the peak funding was drawing to a close. When he started, the
shelves surrounding his workplace held books awaiting cataloging arranged by
the year of purchase. The oldest section was four years old. The seven other cata-
logers in the department had similar collections in their work areas. Departmen-
tal policy was for librarians to prepare all cataloging copy and edit card sets,
including those from the Library of Congress (LC), and pass the material on to a
clerical assistant for typing. Other clerical staff handled the physical preparation
of the items and filed the cards in the public catalog and shelflist under close
supervision of librarians.
</p>
<p>It was clear that short of hiring four or five more librarians as well as addi-
tional support staff, there was no way to reduce the backlog and still use the ex-
isting procedures. Two catalogers received permission to survey other state
university libraries to see what they were doing. The data suggested that every-
one was struggling with the same issue, and one or two departments were trying
to have clerks work on materials with LC copy. Soon that approach became com-
monplace, and, in time, as duties changed, the backlogs, at least in small- and
medium-sized academic libraries, began to disappear.
</p>
<p>Use of paraprofessional staff and their education is much more organized in
countries other than the United States. A number of European countries have for-
mal education programs for paraprofessionals. Examples of non&ndash;North Ameri-
can guidelines are the Library Association of Australia, Working Party on Work
Level Standards, Work Level Guidelines for Librarians and Library Technicians
(Canberra: Library Association of Australia, 1985) and D. Baker&rsquo;s Training
Library Assistants, Guidelines for Training in Libraries, 6 (London: Library
Association, 1985).
</p>
<p>Both Canada and Australia have highly developed programs. All of the pro-
grams for technicians and paraprofessionals, including those in the United
States, are two years in length in post-secondary institutions. Australian pro-
grams are part of Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges, whereas
Canadian programs are found in community colleges, institutes of technology,
and some universities. Nordic country programs are part of each country&rsquo;s
two-year college system. A good article on non&ndash;U.S. programs with in-depth
coverage of the Canadian system is &ldquo;Library Technician Programs.&rdquo;10 As of
2001, there was no national system in the United States, and many states have no
formal education programs for paraprofessionals. ALA&rsquo;s Support Staff Interests
Round Table is moving toward a national program or a model for state programs;
see their report, issued in May 2000, at http://www.ala.org/ssirt/contedu.pdf.
</p>
<p>The first Canadian program was started at the Manitoba Institute of Tech-
nology in 1962.11 Since that time, programs have been developed in eight of the
ten provinces. The Canadian Library Association (CLA) played an active role in
monitoring the quality of these programs in three ways. First, they were instru-
mental in the development of guidelines for the training of library technicians.12
Second, CLA several times funded the visits of John Marshall, a professor at the
University of Toronto Faculty of Library Science, to each program. Third, for
</p>
<p>Library Personnel Categories 25</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>many years CLA published surveys documenting how well these programs con-
formed to the guidelines.13 Several programs did not follow CLA&rsquo;s guidelines;
most closed because their graduates had difficulty obtaining jobs as library
technicians.
</p>
<p>Tracing the history of U.S. paraprofessionals is beyond the scope of this
book; however, we do want to provide a thumbnail outline to illustrate the rela-
tively long and slow development of the field. Los Angeles City College (a
two-year college) offered what was the first course for &ldquo;library assistants&rdquo; in
1937. The first full program for paraprofessionals we are aware of was the one
started in 1947 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School. Two
years later, the Special Libraries Association instituted course work in clerical
and assistant practices as a joint effort with the New York City YWCA&rsquo;s Ballard
School. The American Library Association&rsquo;s reaction to such efforts was mixed
at best and discouraged such programs on the basis that they created &ldquo;cheap
librarians.&rdquo;14 However, by 1967 ALA was following the lead of the Canadian
Library Association in affirming the need for technicians and paraprofessionals
and programs to educate them. Today the Council on Library Technology
(COLT) is the leading U.S. association representing the interests of
paraprofessionals. COLT has been affiliated with ALA since 1976, the same
year that Australia adopted national guidelines for educating paraprofessionals.
</p>
<p>Although the concern about librarians (professionals) losing their positions
because of the existence of technicians and paraprofessionals has abated, some
issues remain. The flavor of library technicians&rsquo; early struggles for recognition
can be found in Jean Riddle&rsquo;s [Weihs] &ldquo;Professionalism for Library Techni-
cians.&rdquo;15 Perhaps the most problematic issue is that of a &ldquo;career ladder.&rdquo; ALA
issued a &ldquo;Library Education and Manpower&rdquo; statement in 1970, with a proposed
revision in 1999 (still pending approval). This statement and various articles
about the statement put forward the concept of a career ladder for library person-
nel. Unfortunately, we have to agree with Anthony Wilson and Robert
Hermanson that &ldquo;library rhetoric has included the notion of a career ladder since
the &lsquo;Library Education and Manpower&rsquo; statement. . . . But the ladder has not been
implemented to a degree that has been satisfactory in terms of &lsquo;growing our
own&rsquo; and promoting people in libraries in a way that taps their potential or their
ambition.&rdquo;16
</p>
<p>In 1973 the U.S. Office of Education published a comprehensive study on
the role and training of technicians and paraprofessionals. The study detailed the
types of positions (and their related activities) in a library in which technicians
and paraprofessionals could expect to work. Although the document is dated, it
does provide a sense of where and how far the field has come in terms of techni-
cians and paraprofessionals as key personnel in library operations:
</p>
<p>Graduates . . . can expect to find employment in many types and
sizes of libraries requiring a variety of responsibilities. Most
graduates will further develop their abilities by continued study
on a part-time basis to keep pace with new developments in
their fields. The following listing shows a sampling of only a
few of the job opportunities for library technical assistants, as
</p>
<p>26 2&mdash;Staffing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>described by employers. Some are beginning positions; others
are attained through work experience or further study, or both.
</p>
<p>1. Library Technical Assistant I&mdash;May perform one or more
of the following: assist readers in locating books and using the
public catalog; supervise shelving and other tasks performed
by student assistants and clerks; supervise the maintenance and
distribution of special collections and equipment; assist in the
cataloging department; and, may be responsible for the repro-
duction of media materials.
</p>
<p>2. Library Technical Assistant II&mdash;May perform all of the
duties of the Library Technical Assistant I, as well as one or
more of the following: supervise the work of Library Technical
Assistant I; assist in the preparation of bibliographies; develop
displays; supervise multiple book stack areas; and, be responsi-
ble for the production of media materials.
</p>
<p>3. Library Technical Assistant III&mdash;May perform all duties
of the Library Technical Assistant II, as well as one or more of
the following: be responsible for supervision of all other library
technical assistants and clerical staff; prepare special bibliogra-
phies; do basic uncomplicated cataloging; provide reference
services on information desks and answer reference questions
of an uncomplicated nature; supervise circulation, interlibrary
loan or periodical services; and, assist with special community
projects and services. The classifications and degrees of re-
sponsibility may vary somewhat depending on the objectives
and size of the particular library, and the clientele it serves. Li-
brary technical assistants work in a great variety of libraries.
These include public and private school libraries, academic li-
braries, public libraries, and special libraries such as medical,
business, and government.17
</p>
<p>As noted previously, many of these activities were performed by librarians at
one time, and today many are markedly changed as a result of technology.
</p>
<p>The importance of technicians and paraprofessionals in U.S. academic librar-
ies is clear from data collected in 1990. A research team conducted a comprehen-
sive survey on the role, status, and working conditions of paraprofessionals.18
They reported that there were 9,466 paraprofessionals working in the reporting
libraries and 7,644 librarians. Some of the data of interest to readers of this book
follow:
</p>
<p>&bull; More than 90 percent of the responding Association of Research Li-
braries reported using paraprofessionals for copy cataloging work.
</p>
<p>&bull; More than 50 percent reported having paraprofessionals engage in some
original descriptive cataloging.
</p>
<p>Library Personnel Categories 27</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; A somewhat surprising 20 percent reported assigning book selection du-
ties to paraprofessionals.
</p>
<p>A good case study article that covers the changes and developments in the role of
technical services is &ldquo;Blurring the Boundaries Between Professional and
Paraprofessional Catalogers at California State University, Northridge.&rdquo;19
</p>
<p>In recent years, many of the major library journals have contained articles
or notices about matters of concern to library technicians. This increase in arti-
cles and announcements is an indication that the role and importance of the tech-
nician are steadily increasing. An excellent source of current information is the
COLT Newsletter. COLT also publishes a directory of LMTA programs. Addi-
tional information on COLT activities is available at http://library.ucr.edu/COLT.
Another good publication is Library Mosaics. A list of Canadian library techni-
cian programs can be found at www.nlc_bnc.ca/services/elic.htm#5.
</p>
<p>Susan Chapman has made an interesting observation about differences be-
tween technicians and paraprofessionals and clerical staff:
</p>
<p>Library technicians also have an outlook distinct from clerical
staff members with whom they may share some tasks. Prepara-
tion of library technicians results in workers who possess com-
plex skills coupled with a dedication to library service. Clerical
workers&rsquo; specific knowledge of particular institutions does not
necessarily indicate commitment to the profession which may
be transferred to other libraries.20
</p>
<p>Library technicians very often supervise clerical and part-time staff as well as
volunteers.
</p>
<p>Clerical Staff
</p>
<p>Clerical staff perform essential activities such as typing, data entry, filing,
answering telephones, and sorting and delivering the mail. The educational level
required ranges from fewer than twelve years of schooling to specialized office
training to several years of college. Most library positions require a high school
degree. Although their work is essential, clerks are usually the lowest paid
full-time library staff members.
</p>
<p>Clerical positions often have a high turnover rate, not only because of the
low salary level, but because some of the work is highly repetitive. There is still a
fair amount of what some people label &ldquo;donkey work&rdquo; in the library. If, occa-
sionally, all library staff do some of the &ldquo;donkey work,&rdquo; for example helping out
with unusually heavy mail or book deliveries, the staff members who perform
this work full-time will see that their efforts are important to the success of the
library. (Ed Evans, the longtime author of this book, recalls the words of the
library director at his first professional job: &ldquo;I expect everyone to get their hands
dirty whenever necessary. When it comes to the work, there are only library staff&mdash;
no librarians and clerks.&rdquo; Those have proven to be words worth remembering
</p>
<p>28 2&mdash;Staffing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and implementing throughout Ed&rsquo;s career.) Using part-time staff for these duties
can help reduce turnover. Another method is to provide cross-training for staff in
several areas. This not only gives the staff some variety but also enables the li-
brary to provide coverage of areas during vacations and sick leave or when a staff
member resigns.
</p>
<p>Part-Time Nonprofessional Staff
</p>
<p>Part-time employees are often students or retired persons who work just a
few hours per week. There are many library duties suitable for people working
fewer than twenty hours per week, such as sorting and delivering mail, biblio-
graphic checking, attaching spine labels, attaching plastic book jackets, and
affixing and recording bar code labels. Like clerical work, this work is often very
routine but nevertheless requires accuracy. Part-time staff often require more
supervisory time and attention than do full-time personnel. This is true even
when the number of total working hours is the same for full- and part-time staff.
Two half-time people often require double the supervision of one full-time person.
</p>
<p>It is possible to keep clerical turnover down by using a variety of manage-
ment techniques, but it is almost impossible to control part-time turnover. Low
pay, routine work, and better full-time employment opportunities inevitably cause
a constant cycle of recruitment, selection, training, supervision, and termination.
</p>
<p>When the part-timers are full-time students, there is yet another dimension
to the situation. For most full-time students, their schooling is paramount, as it
should be. However, test schedules, vacation periods, term paper deadlines, and
a host of other crises create a workforce that is not always dependable. Normally,
full-time staff must cover for absent part-timers, which of course means that
their regular tasks go undone.
</p>
<p>There are challenges in having part-time staff, especially students, but there
are some basic steps to make their employment worthwhile for all concerned.
The key is to use the same selection, orientation, and training for all staff whether
they are full- or part-time. All too often part-timers do not get the same orienta-
tion or depth of training. This is the result of a self-fulfilling prophecy: &ldquo;They
won&rsquo;t stay long so there is no point in spending time orienting and training
them.&rdquo; Not surprisingly, more often than not they do leave.
</p>
<p>Giving the new part-timer an orientation and training on both the job and
how that work is an essential element in the library&rsquo;s service program provides
the person with a sense that his or her efforts are important and worth doing well.
Knowing the library&rsquo;s mission as well as how the various departments interact to
achieve it also helps part-timers understand the context of their tasks. Orienting
them only to the department does little to show the ultimate worth of the work.
</p>
<p>When working with students there are several issues that do not come up
with other part-timers. First, there is the annual cycle of the academic term.
There are the challenges of a changing workforce as terms start and end, sched-
uled holidays occur, term paper &ldquo;crunch time&rdquo; comes, and examinations take
place. This cycle also means there are training challenges: large numbers of stu-
dents to orient and train in a very short period of time. It is difficult to train a large
number of students without careful planning. The planning is relatively easy
</p>
<p>Library Personnel Categories 29</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>compared to how to train them in using equipment and systems in spaces where
only one or two actually work at the same time.
</p>
<p>A second issue is the narrow time window between selection, training, and
having to do the work. Students rarely return more than a day or two before the
term starts, so there is little opportunity for spreading the training out and giving
individuals time to practice. This usually means either a superficial orientation to
a host of situations that may arise or a highly selective set of skills that the imme-
diate supervisor is concerned about at the time.
</p>
<p>Trainers who must also carry out their &ldquo;normal duties&rdquo; during the training
period also have a time crunch: how to perform their other duties while conduct-
ing the training. If the training is not considered a major duty, the person may not
give the part-timers the attention they deserve and need to become effective
employees. One way to make the importance of the training clear to all con-
cerned, including senior management, is to have the work be a significant part of
the person&rsquo;s annual performance review.
</p>
<p>Another useful step, especially for student workers, is to have both a job
description and a set of performance expectations for all part-time positions. The
material does not have to be complex but should outline key activities, results,
behavior, and skills needed, as well as two or three performance expectations.
</p>
<p>A final step, more often an issue with student employees, is follow-up train-
ing. There is seldom time to cover everything that may come up for the students
in a single session; in fact, it is not always a good idea to try to do so. Single-session
training for students is rather common. Saving the infrequent situations for later
follow-up sessions, after the individuals have had time to practice the basic or
key activities, also permits the trainer to address any problems in those areas.
</p>
<p>Nonprofessional Volunteers
</p>
<p>Volunteers are important in staffing many libraries; however, they are a
mixed blessing. The initial thought is, &ldquo;Of course we can use some free help.&rdquo;
Certainly in school media centers and small public libraries volunteers play a
critical role. From the budget point of view, one can easily see the pros and cons
of using volunteers. Limited funds for staffing make using volunteers appealing,
especially if one has tried and failed to get a new staff position approved. But if a
volunteer &ldquo;helps out for a while&rdquo; and the work gets done, all too often the budget
officers see no reason to approve additional staff. A comprehensive study of
library volunteers that includes useful information for public libraries in any
country is The Use of Volunteers in Public Libraries.21
</p>
<p>Libraries have had volunteer programs for years. However, since the
mid-1970s, when budget constraints led to at least hiring freezes, if not staff
reductions, securing an additional full-time equivalent (FTE) position for a
library has been and remains a rare event. There has been a growing use of volun-
teers, who are more and more called upon to perform necessary work rather than
work that is nice to have done if there is extra time. That change carries with it
important implications for the salaried staff. One result of the budget crunch is
that small libraries, especially those in schools and small towns, are all too often
completely dependent on volunteers to provide any level of service. Many libraries
</p>
<p>30 2&mdash;Staffing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>outside the corporate environment have some volunteers working on their behalf
even if they do not have a formal volunteer program.
</p>
<p>A few years ago there was a national publicity effort to promote the impor-
tance and value of volunteerism. At the beginning of 2002, there was little evi-
dence that the publicity has done much to increase the number of volunteers.
Some press coverage focused on building volunteerism and service into educa-
tional curricula in high schools and colleges. This is not a new concept; John
Dewey pushed it in the 1930s. There are, and long have been, many successful
educational programs of that type, including in libraries. One such example is a
joint project of the St. Paul (Minnesota) Public Library and public school system.
They created a library youth volunteer corps, a mentoring program that involves
teaching others how to use library technology such as online catalogs and
CD-ROM products.
</p>
<p>Another factor that may increase the use of &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; in publicly funded
libraries is government initiatives in some jurisdictions, commonly known as
&ldquo;welfare reform.&rdquo; One component of the &ldquo;from welfare to work&rdquo; concept is
some community service. Because many libraries are public institutions, there
will be an expectation that libraries will take on their share of former welfare
recipients, who must perform as much as forty hours of community service work
per week. The &ldquo;community service&rdquo; component now appears to be an estab-
lished element in such programs. This will probably result in increasing pressure
on public and school libraries to take on more and more &ldquo;volunteers,&rdquo; especially
in communities where the libraries say they are in need of staff. Two additional
&ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; programs that present both opportunities and challenges are
court-ordered community service and work placement programs.
</p>
<p>There will be a number of challenges for existing full- and part-time paid
staff in a situation where the library takes on some of the participants in such a
program. One expectation is that the &ldquo;host site&rdquo; will provide the volunteers with
opportunities that both help establish an appropriate work behavior pattern&mdash;
such as on-time, regularly scheduled attendance&mdash;and develop work skills to
prepare them to be more competitive in the labor market. The first goal will not
be too much of a challenge because an existing volunteer program has the same
expectations for all its participants: Often work schedules are an area of flexibil-
ity in existing programs to retain the volunteer help.
</p>
<p>However, the second goal, developing marketable job skills, may present a
challenge in at least two ways. First, many of the tasks that libraries have for vol-
unteers are specific to the library environment, especially given the high degree
of automation in libraries. Thus the tasks that are available do not translate well
into the general labor market. (Perhaps if libraries can count on the community
service component lasting for a number of years, it would be possible to create
the equivalent of several FTEs for participants. These FTEs could be incorpo-
rated in the regular operating procedures, performing necessary rather than
desirable activities.)
</p>
<p>A second factor is the amount of staff time necessary to train and supervise
program participants. Anyone who has been a supervisor of an intern&mdash;someone
who is taking course work and wants a career in the field&mdash;knows how much time
that activity takes. Further complicating the issue is the level of motivation of the
</p>
<p>Library Personnel Categories 31</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>participants, which may not be high. Library trainers need to learn how to in-
crease or maintain a high level of motivation. Motivation of volunteers is always
a factor in any program and becomes more important with welfare-to-work par-
ticipants. One hopes that some of the groups identified in Georgean Johnson-
Coffey&rsquo;s article22 as currently involved in working with welfare reform partici-
pants will publish their experiences to assist other libraries starting a program.
</p>
<p>Volunteers have become an important element in operating many types of
libraries and are likely to increase in number as a result of welfare reform initia-
tives. A review of literature on volunteerism suggests &ldquo;that effective manage-
ment of volunteer activities in public organizations requires a management style
that is less technically rational and bureaucratic than the traditional model . . . at a
very minimum, a public organization using volunteers as well as paid staff must
be flexible to accommodate two work forces with very different expectations
and backgrounds.&rdquo;23
</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of background a volunteer brings to the job,
training and supervisory time can far exceed that needed to train and supervise a
person the library would hire. No matter how much knowledge and skill they
bring with them, volunteers usually require more supervisory time than do paid
staff. Supervisors, or &ldquo;volunteer coordinators,&rdquo; must devote time to working and
interacting with the volunteers. Volunteers&rsquo; &ldquo;salaries&rdquo; come in the form of satis-
faction in knowing the library fully appreciates their efforts, so the coordinators
should spend time providing positive feedback to maintain volunteer interest and
willingness to contribute their time. Providing corrective feedback that does not
cause the volunteer to quit is also a challenge for the coordinator. Normally the
library has fewer corrective options with volunteer staff than with paid person-
nel, and the coordinator needs excellent &ldquo;people skills&rdquo; to bring about the desired
change while retaining the volunteer.
</p>
<p>If the volunteer works alongside permanent staff, different treatment for the
volunteer can cause serious staff morale problems. An excellent guide to using
volunteers is Carla Campbell&rsquo;s Volunteer Involvement in California Libraries:
Best Practices.24 This publication addresses all aspects of volunteer work, in-
cluding full-time staff reactions and relations. It also contains a number of forms
and materials used in libraries across the state. Richard Sundeen has been re-
searching the topic for more than ten years. One of his articles, published in
2000, addressed the value of and obstacles to teenagers becoming volunteers;25
another, &ldquo;Differences in Personal Goals and Attitudes Among Volunteers,&rdquo; ap-
peared in 1992.26

<p>One key to having a successful customer service&ndash;oriented library is making
certain all staff have adequate and appropriate training and development oppor-
tunities. (Training funds are sometimes the most difficult to secure from funding
authorities.) There are several types of needs and opportunities. Needs are re-
lated to a person&rsquo;s specific job duties; opportunities may or may not be directly
job related. Those libraries that provide opportunities for and encourage all staff
to continue their education generally have high morale.
</p>
<p>32 2&mdash;Staffing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>There is no question that staff needs continuous updated training as librar-
ies add to or upgrade existing technology. (Because securing training funds is
difficult, it is sometimes helpful to have a vendor include the cost for training the
staff in the price of the hardware or software rather than attempting to secure sep-
arate training funds.) One &ldquo;downside&rdquo; of technology is that it changes constantly
and there is a never-ending need for staff and customers to adjust to the changes
and receive frequent training.
</p>
<p>Chapter 1 noted the impact technology has had on technical services. There
are probably few, if any, large or medium-sized libraries that are not virtually
closed when their computer systems go down. With &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; library systems
handling most of basic library functions and local networks providing &ldquo;produc-
tivity software,&rdquo; such as word processing and spreadsheet applications, library
staff members often spend a substantial part, if not all, of their workday at a PC
or terminal. When one adds an ever-increasing variety of electronic services,
there is almost no full-time staff member who would not benefit from some train-
ing on a software package or system upgrade. (There is a need for ergonomic
training for staff who spend several hours a day &ldquo;online.&rdquo; There is also a manage-
ment responsibility to ensure that workstations are ergonomically correct.) Li-
braries must think about three types of technology training needs: existing staff,
new hires, and customers. Where does the library turn for such training?
</p>
<p>Vendors are one option; especially those who handle integrated library sys-
tems and those selling electronic products. Unfortunately, most of the system
vendors charge for their training, which usually means newly hired staff must re-
ceive their training from existing staff. This works well if the existing staff fully
understand the system. Marketing needs may force vendors of electronic prod-
ucts to offer free training; this is a &ldquo;service&rdquo; the library should take advantage of,
especially because it is built into the cost of the product.
</p>
<p>The least desirable approach is to try to do in-house (self) training based on
vendor documentation; however, it may be the only immediately available op-
tion. When necessary, the most cost-effective approach is having the most expe-
rienced person work through the material and then teach other staff members. If
the product affects most of the departments in the library, using a &ldquo;mentor&rdquo; ap-
proach often is effective. That is, one person in each department becomes the
&ldquo;teacher or expert&rdquo; and works with colleagues as a trainer.
</p>
<p>Another option is to seek workshops offered by various library groups. For
example, almost every vendor of integrated library systems has a &ldquo;users&rsquo;
group&rdquo;&mdash;customers using the product who have some voice in how the product
changes. Users&rsquo; groups often have regional &ldquo;chapters&rdquo; that have occasional
meetings at which experiences are exchanged, as well as holding workshops on a
new &ldquo;module&rdquo; or upgrade. Sometimes library consortia acquire an electronic
product or service and then arrange one or more workshops for staff members in
the use of the item. State, provincial, regional, and national library association
meetings are other sources for workshops that are job related; many now offer
programs designed for librarians and paraprofessionals. The major drawback to
all these sources is that a particular type of training may not be available when a
library most needs it.
</p>
<p>Staff Development and Training 33</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Productivity software training is another matter. If the library&rsquo;s parent or-
ganization does not provide training, the library must either handle it in-house or
use a commercial training organization. Commercial training is usually available
in larger communities for most of the widely used word processing, database
management, graphics presentation, and spreadsheet applications. Companies
often offer several levels of training&mdash;beginning, intermediate, and ad-
vanced&mdash;so there is some hope of getting the training at the level needed. Expect
to pay a price for such availability, often $300 to $400 per person for six hours of
training. Another option is to use video or CD-ROM training packages that cost
about the same as the fee for a single person at a commercial program. The obvi-
ous advantage of this approach is that many staff members can benefit from the
expenditure, and they can select the best time for them to take the training. One
such source (and there are others; this is not an endorsement) of productivity and
network training programs is Learn Key, a company that the LMU library uses.
</p>
<p>Organizations such as OCLC (http://www.oclc.org/support/training) and
the National Library of Canada are major resources for technical service train-
ing. Also, universities with library schools frequently offer continuing education
programs; two examples are the University of Toronto and the University of Cal-
ifornia, Los Angeles. The LMU library&rsquo;s cataloging department sends all new
staff to OCLC training as soon as possible and makes extensive use of the ad-
vanced training offerings. Other training opportunities are frequently offered by
regional OCLC organizations such as CAPCON or SOLINET, with a substantial
discount for system members.
</p>
<p>All staff should have opportunities to develop personal skills and knowl-
edge that may or may not be directly job related. Encouraging staff to secure an
academic degree, whether library related or not, is good for overall staff morale.
In fact, the better educated the staff is, the better service the library is likely to
provide. When staff members know there is support for self-development they
generally view the library as more than the place they have to spend time to get a
paycheck. Such an attitude often translates into high-quality performance and
customer service.
</p>
<p>Staff training is essential and costs money as well as time away from &ldquo;nor-
mal duties.&rdquo; One public library director estimated that he spends about 1 percent
of the total operating budget on staff training (in this case just over U.S.
$150,000 in 1995) and wondered if that was even enough.27 Loyola Marymount
Libraries plan for just under 1 percent but know that by year&rsquo;s end they will
exceed that amount and still not have addressed all the year&rsquo;s training needs. We
agree with the following statement by Glen Holt:
</p>
<p>One thing is certain, however, no library can create a cus-
tomer-oriented information-and-knowledge institution without
considerable staff training. A solid staff training program is an
operational imperative for an effective bottom line in the
twenty-first-century library, and library budgets need to reflect
the library training effort.28

<p>The function of the paraprofessional, regardless of the type of library, is to
assume clerical and paraprofessional duties so librarians can perform profes-

</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Technical Services Organization,&rdquo; Cecily Johns wrote that the motto
for cataloging and technical services is and will be &ldquo;more, better, cheaper,
faster.&rdquo;1 These are shorthand labels for what today&rsquo;s administrators of technical
services units must constantly address. This chapter covers how unit heads in
technical services try to respond to those needs. The first sections of this chapter
are organized around those labels, in a slightly different order: more,
faster/better, cheaper.
</p>
<p>Supervising or administering a unit in technical services calls upon all of
the same basic management skills and knowledge as does any other unit in the
library. However, some of those &ldquo;basic&rdquo; skills are being called upon with
ever-increasing frequency as libraries try to adjust to a changing external envi-
ronment. Some of the skills that need to come into play more often are managing
change, fostering innovation and creativity, cost containment, team building,
and staff motivation.
</p>
<p>
���-+&amp;��.�*��
&amp;�
</p>
<p>For most libraries in the 1980s and early 1990s, &ldquo;more&rdquo; did not mean higher
volumes of books and serials to acquire, catalog, and process. The &ldquo;more&rdquo; was
and is the expanding range of material formats that have to be dealt with on a reg-
ular basis. A seemingly constantly changing &ldquo;information industry&rdquo; that creates,
and occasionally drops, new formats for delivering material has generated pres-
sures on technical service units. Electronic materials quickly demonstrated that
libraries had to &ldquo;gear up&rdquo; to handle not only constant change but also very rapid
shifts in direction. In addition, as economic conditions improved, there has been
some increase in library budgets that allows for increasing the volume of print
materials acquired; however, in many instances that increase falls upon a signifi-
cantly reduced technical services staff.

<p>As both a library school educator and library administrator for many years,
Ed Evans has experienced those events from both the classroom/conceptual
point of view and the &ldquo;how are we going to deal with this development&rdquo; practical
perspective. The factors noted in Chapter 1 as leading to the changing shape of
technical services&mdash;economic, technological, and financial&mdash;make it difficult
for practitioners to keep abreast of the shifting landscape of information re-
sources and still get today&rsquo;s work done.
</p>
<p>For practitioners a major problem is finding time to carry out necessary duties
and attempt to learn about the most critical new developments in their area(s) of
responsibility. Time management is one of the skills that technical services
supervisors and administrators increasingly must call upon. To learn about new
formats, who handles them, pricing/discount models, how to represent the for-
mat in a MARC record or OPAC, and so forth takes more time than outsiders
realize, and the day&rsquo;s ongoing work does not stop. Most of the time, the new for-
mats do not replace an existing format; rather each is just one more for the unit to
handle.
</p>
<p>Whereas public, school, and community college libraries have a long his-
tory of acquiring and building collections of audiovisual and nonbook formats,
the same is not true of large academic libraries. Today, with the proliferation of
electronic databases, even the largest research libraries are adding formats that
fifteen to twenty years ago were considered inappropriate for their collections.
</p>
<p>An example of the problems encountered when adding a new format to a
library&rsquo;s collecting profile is what took place at Harvard University when Edward
Evans was head of the anthropology library. Interviews with the full-time faculty
and graduate teaching assistants revealed a strong demand for adding
ethnographic and archaeological videocassettes to the collection for both teach-
ing and research purposes. At that time, Harvard College Libraries collected
only print materials. When the first invoices for videos arrived in the central
accounting office, the result was a telephone call stating that this type of pur-
chase was not allowed. After considerable discussion, a decision was reached
that, if the anthropology library could secure grant money for such purchases,
they would be acceptable. It was relatively easy to find some &ldquo;seed funds&rdquo; to
establish a collection, but securing ongoing funding from granting agencies was
next to impossible. The budget committee asked for an in-person presentation as
well as a written document explaining why operating funds should be allocated
for nonprint acquisitions. (It was notable there were no such requests to justify
the 30 percent increase in book funds and a 42 percent increase in the serials
budgets&mdash;both were granted without comment.) Finding the funds was the easy
part of the process; learning about sources, establishing business relationships,
determining how to handle the cataloging in a system not set up for anything but
print materials, and so forth, required significant amounts of technical service
staff time. Most of the staff were longtime employees who had no prior experi-
ence with video and felt this was a major increase in their workload, yet they
were happy about the very substantial budget increases for print materials. With
effort the staff made the transition to handling a new format.
</p>
<p>This example highlights two facets of the current technical services envi-
ronment: time allocation/availability and staff morale. Although the underlying

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>steps for handling the new format or material may be the same as for other mate-
rials, there are special characteristics that make each one a separate process, thus
requiring remembering many more details. Some formats carry with them issues
that require new steps or procedures. One example is legal issues associated with
electronic resources, such as licensing agreements and contracts (covered in
more detail in Chapters 7 and 11).
</p>
<p>Extra steps or procedures, even having to think &ldquo;what do I need to do differ-
ently with this format,&rdquo; take a little more time. Unfortunately, time is finite.
While there is always a chance, however remote, of acquiring additional money,
people, or other resources, there is no chance of expanding the time available.
All one can do is use time as effectively as possible or find new ways of doing
things that are more efficient.

<p>Being a good manager of time can assist in more ways than just &ldquo;getting
more work done.&rdquo; It can help reduce work stress for one&rsquo;s own benefit (and
sometimes for one&rsquo;s colleagues as well). For some individuals, it may also assist
in delegation of activities or reduce the tendency to &ldquo;put off until tomorrow
whatever one can do today&rdquo; behavior.
</p>
<p>These tips are relatively easy to implement; what is more difficult is to fol-
low them long enough to make them habits rather than special activities. Perhaps
the least complicated but hardest to follow is avoiding the &ldquo;paper shuffle&rdquo; game.
In most work situations, there is a steady flow of paper across the desk or into the
in-basket. Some of it is informational in nature and should be the easiest to read
and dispose of. Too often there is a tendency to quickly look at such items and
think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to this later when I have more time&rdquo; and set it aside in what be-
comes an ever-growing pile of &ldquo;when I have time reading.&rdquo; For many people that
growing pile (mountain) becomes a source of stress because &ldquo;when I have time&rdquo;
never seems to come. Reading the material when it arrives and taking the appro-
priate action&mdash;file it for future reference, pass it on, or recycle the paper&mdash;will
resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>Some material may call for a response by a given date. Again, responding
right away will save time in the long run. There is a tendency to think, &ldquo;Oh, this is
due in two weeks (or whenever), I&rsquo;ll do this later.&rdquo; If nothing more, handling the
matter immediately saves the review time involved in rereading the material at
the time the response is due. In addition, given that many issues arise unexpect-
edly, having completed an &ldquo;expected&rdquo; project ahead of time allows for more
flexibility in responding to &ldquo;rush&rdquo; projects that suddenly appear. Waiting until
later may lead to the item getting mislaid until after the date due, and that can
cause an even greater expenditure of time and effort by various people. There are
items that require some searching for information or just straightforward time to
think about before taking the appropriate action; a useful method for handling
such items is to have a filing system based on action time requirements&mdash;start
tomorrow, the day after, in three days, and so forth. (This approach also helps
organize time, as discussed later.)
</p>
<p>42 3&mdash;Technical Services Administration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A few items are complex or difficult &ldquo;projects&rdquo; that may seem overwhelm-
ing. One way to handle those items is to establish a &ldquo;finish date&rdquo; that is slightly
earlier than the required date and break the activity into small, daily actions to
maintain a sense of progress and a measure of success.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the second most common suggestion for managing time is to create
&ldquo;to-do&rdquo; lists. Using a file folder system is a sound variation of the to-do list. Set
up a file for each day of the week, one for next week, two weeks, and three
weeks, thus covering a month. The files can hold some of the papers mentioned
previously that require some time to address. Each day just before leaving work
go into the next day&rsquo;s folder and set up the priorities for the items in the folder
(the next day&rsquo;s to-do list). This establishes for the next day the items to attend to
and their priorities. It is a good idea to make the first item something of high in-
terest and relatively easy to accomplish; this creates a positive sense of achieve-
ment that may carry over into less interesting but necessary activities. At the end
of each work week, again at the end of the day, go through the next week&rsquo;s folder
and sort the material into the appropriate folders by the day each item should be
handled. Certainly setting up such a system takes some time, and the daily re-
view does so as well; however, as one of the authors can attest, it saves a surpris-
ing amount of time in the long run.
</p>
<p>Interruptions are one of the most common reasons given for not having
enough time. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for all the interruptions I&rsquo;d be fine,&rdquo; is a lament of
many staff members. Interruptions cost time, even when they are warranted, be-
cause they fragment one&rsquo;s activities. It always takes a few minutes to get back to
where one left off in a task or thinking after the interruption. The two most fre-
quent sources of interruptions are the telephone and colleagues &ldquo;dropping by.&rdquo;
Managing the telephone is easier to handle than workmates, but both can be done
without offending people.
</p>
<p>With telephone calls, batch the necessary ones and spend a few minutes
planning each: &ldquo;What do I need to convey or learn.&rdquo; Make a list for each call and
stick to it. Use a large writing pad to keep all the notes and lists together.
(Looking for the lunch napkin, business card, or empty envelope with the needed
information is a great time waster.) Time management consultants often suggest
that a business call should not require more than three minutes.2 If the matter is
too complex or detailed to handle in that time, consider some form of written
communication. This is a useful guideline for the majority of calls, but there are
exceptions, especially when developing or maintaining a working relationship
with someone in another organization, such as a library vendor or bindery firm. It
is also good, if not always possible, to batch return calls. A useful approach to
handling incoming calls, at least from other library staff members and those with
whom one works closely on a regular basis, is to tell people &ldquo;the best time to call
me is between x and y.&rdquo; Although this does not and should not stop calls from
coming in at other times, it does in time lead to batching of many, if not most, in-
coming calls. During that calling time frame, engage in activities that take less
concentration, making the interruptions less of a problem.
</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s technology environment, e-mail can become almost as big a time
waster as the telephone. Use the same approach to e-mail as to the telephone.
Batch the reading of and responses to these messages. Don&rsquo;t fall into the pattern
</p>
<p>Tips for Effective Time Management 43</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of leaving your e-mail active all day or frequently checking to see whether there
is mail if you want to make the most effective use of your time.
</p>
<p>With colleagues, if at all possible, try to establish time frames when &ldquo;drop-
ping by&rdquo; is welcome and times when dropping by is not welcome. For supervi-
sors, it is a little easier to establish times when staff can just come by with
questions as well as some time during the day when &ldquo;the door is closed,&rdquo; even if
there is no physical door to close. In smoothly running units, establishing such
times for everyone is relatively easy. In times of change or uncertainty creating
such time is problematic, but even in those circumstances having some private
work time can be beneficial. However, supervisors need to make it clear that a
&ldquo;closed door time&rdquo; does not mean they are unavailable for unusual or emergency
situations.
</p>
<p>Sometimes a person likes to engage in &ldquo;small talk&rdquo; before and after getting
to the purpose of the visit. Frequently these are also individuals who, if allowed,
will spend more time on the informal and social aspects of the &ldquo;visit&rdquo; than on the
issue in question. Setting time limits and sticking to them&mdash;&ldquo;I can give you xx
minutes&rdquo;&mdash;is a sound method for any interruption, unless of course the person in
question is a supervisor. However, a supervisor should be as concerned about ef-
fective time usage as the person interrupted and take no more time than neces-
sary. Finally, there is nothing wrong with asking people what it is they want to
discuss, in a polite way, if they are having trouble getting to the point.
</p>
<p>There are many other time management techniques; several books on this
topic are listed in the Suggested Reading section of this chapter.

</p>
<p>Certainly the Internet has contributed significantly to the &ldquo;more&rdquo; factor. On
the plus side, it has helped with the faster/better factors. Think of the Internet as
just another tool rather like the MARC format that facilitates more effective use
of time and effort.
</p>
<p>For example, in the not-so-distant past libraries often compared working
practices and policies by conducting a field trip or site visit to neighboring librar-
ies. Although such trips still occur, they are becoming rare. In their place, staff
use the Internet through e-mail systems and discussion lists to post questions
such as, &ldquo;How do you handle x?&rdquo; In addition to saving travel time and expenses,
responses can come in from around the world in some cases and staff can draw
on a much wider range of experience. Furthermore, discussion lists help keep the
staff informed about new developments and issues. Technical service librarians
and senior paraprofessional staff usually subscribe to several such lists.
</p>
<p>Each of the topics covered in this book has a number of Web sites devoted
to it. There are URLs throughout the book, but these addresses were last verified
during the final proofreading and may well have changed. A good starting point,
no matter what library topic is of interest, is the Internet Library for Librarians
(http://www.itcompany.com/inforetriever).
</p>
<p>Although collection development is only of passing interest for this book, a
number of Web sites are useful to both collection development staff and acquisi-
tions personnel. These range from information producer home pages (an example

.edu) to general online vendors such as Amazon (http://www.amazon.com).
Looking for an out-of-print (OP) title? Try Bibliofind at http://www.bibliofind
.com. Sites like the last two provide links to reviews and other information as
well as providing the ordering capability. A few offer Boolean searching in addi-
tion to the expected author, title, publisher, and ISBN (International Standard
Book Number) searches.
</p>
<p>Acquisition Web sites are covered in more detail in Chapters 7 and 8, but a
few general points are worthy of mention here, given that the capabilities they
provide can be considered management tools. Almost all library vendors now
have a Web presence and at least a limited search capability of their databases in
conjunction with online ordering. Some offer electronic invoicing and down-
loading, at least with some ILS systems. A library&rsquo;s ability to take advantage of
these electronic services is, in part, dependent on the relationship between the li-
brary&rsquo;s ILS vendor and other library vendors. The interface between the ILS and
vendor systems is something these firms must resolve. All the library can do is
press both firms to create, maintain, and improve the interface. Carol Pitts (now
Carol Diedricks) outlined the problem of technology and vendors in &ldquo;Using Auto-
mation in Technical Services to Foster Innovation&rdquo;:
</p>
<p>For example, the Ohio State University Libraries (OSUL) was
an early test site for OCLC&rsquo;s PromptCat. The library tested the
product in early 1994 and made the decision at that time that it
was an innovation that would be adopted to free staff for more
complex cataloging. However, OSUL had to first wait for Inno-
vative Interfaces, Inc. (III) to write the necessary programming
to incorporate the new product. Once the programming was
available, the Libraries&rsquo; approval plan vendor, Baker &amp;Taylor,
was in the midst of a system change which precluded them
from completing their implementation of the product. Finally,
in 1997, the Libraries are in the actual implementation stage of
a product which was tested and adopted in 1994.3
</p>
<p>A specific example of how technology assists in the &ldquo;faster/better&rdquo; side of
acquisitions work is in the area of letting end-users know what new titles are
ready for use. Years ago many libraries&mdash;academic, public, and special, in par-
ticular&mdash;issued some type of &ldquo;Recent Additions&rdquo; or &ldquo;New Titles&rdquo; lists. Pro-
ducing such lists was labor intensive: collecting the slips for recently processed
titles, typing the list, verifying the information was correct, maintaining a mail-
ing list for interested recipients, and producing and distributing the information.
By the mid-1980s such lists were disappearing from the workload as libraries
struggled with budget and staff reductions. End-users voiced concerns about the
loss and questioned the factors that led to dropping the lists.
</p>
<p>Today such lists are making a comeback thanks to technology. Many sys-
tems make it possible to run a management report that lists all the titles added to
the database between x and y dates. Most allow downloading of the information
into a word processing program where a staff member can quickly format the
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>data for &ldquo;publication.&rdquo; The end product is often both a paper list and an elec-
tronic version for posting on the library&rsquo;s home page. Another step can be to
e-mail specific information such as the &ldquo;item is ready for use&rdquo; to the requestor
and others who have an interest in the topic. This is a return to what was part of a
service called selective dissemination of information (SDI) back when there was
staffing available for such activities.
</p>
<p>Serials have always been a challenge for library staff due to their changing
nature. (Years ago they were thought to be THE challenge; today technology has
assumed that mantle.) New titles, changing titles, variations in numbering sys-
tems, special issues, delays in publications, suspension of publication, and ceas-
ing to exist are but a few of the variations serials present to libraries. Keeping up
to date in a print-only environment was almost impossible; today the Internet
makes it almost possible. Anyone with an interest in serials should subscribe to
SERIALST (http://www.uvm.edu/~bmaclenn/serialst.htm), an open forum for
discussing the perplexing world of serials. Because subscribers are from around
the world&mdash;more than forty countries are represented&mdash;one quickly learns that
many, if not most, of the concerns about serials are global rather than local in
character. Electronic journals and/or paper-based titles with electronic editions
represent another challenge for technical services. Some vendors have records
that can be downloaded, assuming that the ILS allows for that and can make the
necessary links. For many libraries, if the process depended solely on manual in-
putting, there would be many fewer records for electronic resources.
</p>
<p>Cataloging departments and catalogers have been &ldquo;online&rdquo; for longer than
most others in the library world. A popular discussion list for catalogers is
AUTOCAT, initiated many years ago by list owner Judith Hopkins of the State
University of New York, Buffalo. Cataloging questions often elicit dozens of re-
sponses, sometimes within hours of being posted. Opinions and answers come
from all over the world, sometimes with documentation. Some of the most pro-
lific participants work at national libraries, research institutions, or specialized
information centers. Subscriptions can be entered by sending a message to
LISTSERV@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU with a blank subject line and
the message SUBSCRIBE [YOUR NAME]. The Canadian counterpart to
AUTOCAT is the Canadian Library Association Technical Services Interest
Group Forum, TSIG-L. It can be located via the Canadian Library Association
Web page at www.cla.ca.
</p>
<p>Catalogers frequently are able to obtain authoritative information, free cat-
aloging advice, selected tools, and other assistance from Web sites maintained
by national libraries and bibliographic networks as well as by commercial ven-
dors of cataloging systems, publishers, and other companies. Some of the most
useful government and nonprofit organization Web sites are the Library of Congress
Cataloging Directorate, available at www.loc.gov/catdir; the National Library of
Canada, available at www.nlc-bnc.ca; OCLC, available at www.oclc.org; and
the Research Libraries Group, parent organization of the RLIN bibliographic
network, available at www.rlg.org. Offerings at these Web sites vary from orga-
nization to organization and change over time. Features include descriptions of
the organization&rsquo;s latest activities and projects, lists of publications and online
order forms, and e-mail access to persons responsible for answering inquiries or
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>providing additional information. Occasionally, full text of some documents or
methods of downloading them free of charge are posted. Early in 2001, OCLC
began giving an online course for a fee on the cataloging of Internet resources. A
description of the course, fees, and subscription process are posted on OCLC&rsquo;s
Web site.
</p>
<p>The Internet and the Web are great tools, but they can also be a problem in
that the staff can spend a little too much time &ldquo;surfing&rdquo; with or without realizing
it. Some control and self-monitoring is necessary to maintain unit productivity.
However, supervisors should keep in mind the comments of Patricia McCoy: &ldquo;Is
any of this [Internet/Web browsing] related to the work piled up on my desk?
Sometimes. Is it related to my position in the library as whole? Again, some-
times. Is it related to my personal job satisfaction and career goal? Most
defintely.&rdquo;4 Allowing some level of &ldquo;surfing&rdquo; may help reduce some of the
workplace stress that is so commonplace in today&rsquo;s changing technical services
environment. Also, staff need to become comfortable with the electronic data-
bases the library purchases to provide proper service.

</p>
<p>Pressure for &ldquo;more, better, faster, cheaper,&rdquo; combined with budget woes
and all too frequently with staff reductions, have led to restructuring of technical
service units. A recent buzzword for what is taking place is &ldquo;reengineering.&rdquo;
Close inspection of what the &ldquo;gurus&rdquo; of reengineering suggest reveals that the
concept has much in common with what was once labeled &ldquo;operations analysis&rdquo;
and &ldquo;scientific management.&rdquo; Essentially, good management practice calls for
ongoing assessment and evaluation of policies, procedures, workflow, and so
forth. Unfortunately, in most situations daily demands seem to keep people from
doing this on a regular basis. What follows is a description of one library&rsquo;s re-
thinking of technical services. It is not presented as a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; but rather as
one example with the process from Ed Evans&rsquo;s work experience. The Suggested
Reading section in this chapter provides references to a number of articles that
describe similar experiences.
</p>
<p>Like most academic libraries during the late 1980s and 1990s, the technical
services units at Loyola Marymount University (LMU) have undergone several
changes. The first change, in large measure triggered by the purchase of an ILS,
was to merge the serials and acquisition units. This was both a supervisory and a
physical merger as well as one that led to an overall reduction in staff by one
FTE. Although it was not thought of as reengineering (the term was not yet popu-
lar in 1988), it did draw on some of the standard work analysis and scientific
management techniques that are now part of the reengineering consultant&rsquo;s
toolkit.
</p>
<p>As the first step, senior staff in both units formed a working team, with the
head of the serials unit acting as team leader. (The head of acquisitions was retir-
ing and the university was in the process of tightening its budget. As a result the
vacancy was &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; for almost three years.) Members developed flow and
</p>
<p>Restructuring to Provide &ldquo;Faster and Better&rdquo; 47</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>decision charts for the existing processes. Senior library managers worked with
the ILS staff and several local libraries using that system to develop similar
charts for several variations for the post-ILS system.
</p>
<p>Reengineering consultants disagree about the effectiveness of charting ex-
isting practices. For example, Michael Hammer and James Champy believe that
it is best to completely ignore what exists and think in terms of what could be
best.5 Others, such as Raymond Manganelli and Mark Klein, think it essential to
take into account the existing environment or work culture while designing the
new system.6 In retrospect, the LMU staff might have decided some things dif-
ferently had they tried to ignore existing processes. However, overall their plan-
ning took into account existing skills and knowledge as well as limitations
imposed by the available physical space, and created a highly workable plan. Ig-
noring those factors probably would have created more problems than it would
have solved.
</p>
<p>The second phase was to ask the standard work analysis questions&mdash;easy to
ask but sometimes painful for staff to answer. For each point in the flow and
decision charts they attempted to answer the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; What is done?
</p>
<p>&bull; Why is it done?
</p>
<p>&bull; Where is it done?
</p>
<p>&bull; When is it done?
</p>
<p>&bull; Who does it?
</p>
<p>&bull; How is it done?
</p>
<p>At various times the team met with the senior library managers for what be-
came known as &ldquo;hot seat sessions.&rdquo; The goal and atmosphere were not confron-
tational, but the sessions were intended to ensure that the team was giving
serious thought to each of the questions. The first two sessions generated re-
sponses that were some variation of &ldquo;because that is the way I/we have always
done it.&rdquo; Later sessions made it clear that the team gave careful thought to each
question and took into account limiting factors such as skill and knowledge sets.
</p>
<p>One of the most difficult aspects of the project for the team was to keep in
mind the &ldquo;system concept.&rdquo; That is, they had to remember that the merged units
were part of a larger system of interacting units. Changes they were considering
might have consequences far beyond the new unit. Therefore, there were several
team presentations to other unit heads to gain feedback about possible impact(s)
on other units. An early presentation focused on several alternatives under con-
sideration and a last session presented what the team hoped was the final plan,
subject to unforeseen concerns from other units.
</p>
<p>Was the project a success? The staff believes it was, as does senior manage-
ment. (The reader may recall that in the Chapter 1 we noted how the workload
has increased for the merged unit over the intervening years.) Was the process
painful? Yes, but because the staff members made the decisions, they worked
hard to make it a successful operation. Is the system the same today as they
</p>
<p>48 3&mdash;Technical Services Administration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>designed it in 1989? No, because developments in the field required additional
changes. Perhaps the best outcome of the project was that the staff saw the value
of asking the &ldquo;why&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo; questions and continue to do so. They see the
process as one that can make their work easier and somewhat less stressful. From
senior management&rsquo;s point of view, the best news is that the entire planning team
is still at the library.
</p>
<p>Other developments that required units to rethink work patterns included
electronic ordering and invoicing, especially because the new method was to be
&ldquo;paperless.&rdquo; The change had an unexpected outcome. The university&rsquo;s internal
auditor requires a paper copy of all orders and invoices in addition to the invoice
copies that go to the business office. Although not a significant issue, it did mean
that some steps staff expected to eliminate are still in place.
</p>
<p>Another planning example can be seen in the implementation of
PromptCat, which called for a new planning team of catalogers and acquisition
staff. The process was not as complicated as the merger but was more conten-
tious because it demonstrated that neither unit really understood what the other
did. While the early implementation stages were just taking place at the time of
writing, it appears likely the team will recommend substantial cross-training for
staff in both units.
</p>
<p>�
��'��'�
</p>
<p>One of the reasons the LMU library was a latecomer to PromptCat was the
catalog department&rsquo;s concern about database quality. Currently the catalog de-
partment is solely responsible for quality control of the bibliographic and item
records in the OPAC database. (Everything in the collections, with the exception
of Special Collection items, is part of the database. Print materials in Special
Collections are slowly being added. However, because the unit serves as some-
thing like the university&rsquo;s attic&mdash;including items ranging from furniture to paint-
ings to &ldquo;gold records&rdquo; to postcards&mdash;it will be some time until everything will be
in the OPAC, if it ever is.) Because of that responsibility, the catalogers spent
considerable effort making it &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo; Concerns about PromptCat records led
to a rejection of that product in early 1997.
</p>
<p>OPACs are the end-user&rsquo;s key to unlocking the library&rsquo;s resources and in
some cases the resources of other libraries. They play a more prominent role for
users than did the public card catalogs of years gone by, if for no other reason
than that they generally offer more modes of access and are considered quicker
and easier to use than their forerunners. Given their importance to quality cus-
tomer service, it is a good practice to have just one unit responsible for OPAC
maintenance.
</p>
<p>One long-standing management technique for assigning responsibility for a
task is to give it to the unit or person who most frequently performs the task or
works with the equipment or system. Although all units in a library access the
OPAC database on a regular basis, it is the catalog department that creates the
initial bibliographic record for each new title and item records for additional
copies or volumes in a set that ultimately constitutes the core of the database.
</p>
<p>Standards 49</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Thus it is rather common that the cataloging unit is responsible for maintaining
the database content and its quality.
</p>
<p>If it was just a matter of initial inputting of data, the task would be of less
concern; however, it goes far beyond that. There are ongoing adjustments that
must be, should be, or are desirable to make in the existing records. On the
&ldquo;must&rdquo; side is making changes in the location information when that changes,
say from &ldquo;open stacks&rdquo; to &ldquo;storage.&rdquo; Another &ldquo;must&rdquo; is to delete records for
withdrawn items or those declared &ldquo;lost.&rdquo; A &ldquo;should be&rdquo; issue is making
cross-links when it is discovered that several records are for works by a single
author, who has several name variations, for which there are none. One of the
most desired adjustments, but not implemented as often as staff would like, is up-
dating subject headings, which seem to change on a regular basis. Handling the
changes manually eats up limited staff time. If the ILS does not provide updating
capability, some libraries have found it cost-effective to outsource the work.
</p>
<p>Having &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; records and databases is no longer a realistic goal for most
libraries. In the case of the LMU library catalog department, it was the &ldquo;more
factors&rdquo; that finally triggered the decision to address the question, &ldquo;What is an
error in the bibliographic record?&rdquo; (The question for the database is just begin-
ning to be thought about, but everyone knows it is &ldquo;less than perfect&rdquo; as it stands
and will be more so over time.) The &ldquo;more factor&rdquo; took several forms:
</p>
<p>&bull; A variety of new nonbook formats requested by the School of Education,
</p>
<p>&bull; An ongoing gift of screenplays and music scores from two television/
motion picture production companies (the College of Communication
Arts wants these added to the database),
</p>
<p>&bull; The desire to incorporate Web sites into the OPAC (a Reference Depart-
ment request),
</p>
<p>&bull; New electronic journals,
</p>
<p>&bull; Paper-based serials that include a &ldquo;free&rdquo; electronic subscription, and
</p>
<p>&bull; The Faculty Library Committee&rsquo;s insistence that the paper-based journal
collection be classified.
</p>
<p>All these concerns made it clear that something(s) had to give because there
was to be no additional staffing. One of the &ldquo;somethings&rdquo; that gave was perfec-
tion in the bibliographic records.
</p>
<p>In many ways, the process of deciding what was not an error was more dif-
ficult and painful than the merger of serials and acquisitions. Several of the cata-
loging staff took pride in their perfect records, and the idea that it would be
acceptable to allow less accurate records into the OPAC was a serious personal
issue. It required almost six months of discussion before the department came to
a reluctant agreement on items that could be less than perfect and still go into the
OPAC. That agreement allowed the library to move forward in setting up a
PromptCat program.
</p>
<p>One important factor in moving the group&rsquo;s discussions forward was the
Internet/Web, where they could post questions and receive responses within a
</p>
<p>50 3&mdash;Technical Services Administration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>few days, if not hours. Among the responses was a referral to a University of Cal-
ifornia, Berkeley Library site dealing with performance and quality standards in
technical services. Performance standards and benchmarking have become a
part of technical service operations over the past ten years. Essentially reflecting
the world of technical services in the 1990s, the UC Berkeley Library Technical
Services document begins by stating:
</p>
<p>Since the early 1990s, the Library had experienced the loss of
many skilled, veteran staff through UC early retirement pro-
grams and through normal attrition, without the financial
means of replacing those staff and the critical expertise they
once provided. At the same time the Library began a series of
reorganizations in order to increase efficiency and reduce ex-
penses. . . . In addition, all staff including the Library&rsquo;s most
experienced, was finding it more and more difficult to keep up
with rapidly changing technology and the new policies and pro-
cedures that come with them. . . . The Technical Services Per-
formance Standards serve as a basic measurement for
determining the quality of technical service in central and
branch units. . . . The standards are meant to be applied to the
performance of the unit as whole.&rdquo;7
</p>
<p>The standards are a good starting point for anyone thinking about the need for
something similar. They also contain some very useful outlines for staff training.
</p>
<p>An example of a standard created by a technical service unit is illustrated in
Table 3.1, page 52. The LMU library uses the chart for handling incoming
PromptCat items. The basic concept underlying the chart is that it should have
standards that are clear enough so individuals who have no cataloging back-
ground can quickly review incoming materials and decide if they are acceptable
or require the attention of the cataloging staff. (See chapter 21 for a discussion of
MARC tags.)
</p>
<p>An article by Theresa Bomford and Sue Howley discusses how British li-
braries have addressed the issue of standards and comparisons.8 The Centre for
Interfirm Comparisons handles the data collection, which focuses on the issues
of costs and outputs. Although not perfect, the data do allow for comparing costs
and outputs in public and academic libraries. Bomford and Howley conclude:
&ldquo;In Britain, costing activities and comparisons are very much back in fashion. . . .
There are also, of course, fewer libraries in Britain than in the United States to
persuade. Whether standard costing methods will soon prevail depends perhaps
not so much on those powers of persuasion as on the ability of current research to
overcome some of the technical and separate problems which have bedeviled the
interlibrary comparison program.&rdquo;9

<p>Benchmarking, at least in U.S. libraries, is a recent phenomenon as jurisdic-
tions and organizations have become increasingly concerned about operating
costs. Benchmarking is basically a tool for either internal or external compari-
sons. The National Association of College and University Business Officers
(NACUBO) conducted a number of benchmarking studies of various areas in ac-
ademic institutions during the 1990s. These were large-scale efforts involving
more than 400 institutions in the United States and Canada. LMU&rsquo;s library took
part in three of the projects between 1992 and 1997. Following is some back-
ground on the benchmarking process.
</p>
<p>The goal of benchmarking is to provide data that can help managers answer
the following questions:
</p>
<p>&bull; How well are we doing compared to others?
</p>
<p>&bull; How good do we want to be?
</p>
<p>&bull; Who is doing the best?
</p>
<p>&bull; How do they do it?
</p>
<p>&bull; How can we adapt what they do to our organization?
</p>
<p>&bull; How can we be better than the best?
</p>
<p>There are four basic types of benchmarking&mdash;internal, competitive, indus-
try, and best in class&mdash;but the first two are most commonly used in libraries. As
the label suggests, internal benchmarking looks at internal practices within an
organization. An example is what it costs to create a purchase order in various
departments across a campus. A competitive benchmarking project might collect
data on the cost of creating purchase orders in various departments in a number
of institutions. Industry benchmarking would collect data from all or a represen-
tative sample of all organizations within an &ldquo;industry.&rdquo; (The NACUBO studies
mentioned previously were essentially an industry effort.) Best in class
benchmarking collects information across industries, essentially seeking the
most effective practices.
</p>
<p>Internal benchmarking may also vary between vertical and horizontal projects.
A vertical project seeks to quantify the costs, workloads, and productivity of a
defined functional area; for example, handling accounts payable. A horizontal
study analyzes the cost and productivity of a single process that crosses two or
more functional areas; an example is database searching in acquisitions, catalog-
ing, and interlibrary loan departments.
</p>
<p>The NACUBO studies had several objectives:
</p>
<p>&bull; To assist participating institutions to identify best practices,
</p>
<p>&bull; To provide data that might allow participants to identify areas for
improvement,
</p>
<p>Benchmarking 53</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; To provide data to assess relationships between inputs (primarily re-
source costs) and outputs (generally the quantity and quality of products
and services), and
</p>
<p>&bull; To introduce the concepts of &ldquo;process improvement&rdquo; and awareness of
the value of benchmarking.
</p>
<p>When developing a benchmarking project a key issue is establishing for
each benchmark a clear understanding, by all the participants, of what it will
measure and what to include in the data collected for that benchmark. Under-
standing what will and will not be included&mdash;time, staff salaries, equipment
costs, staff benefits&mdash;is essential if the data are to be useful. (A common problem
in first-time projects is not making it clear what to include in staff costs: just
salary, salary and directed benefits such as health insurance, or all of those plus
vacation and sick leave costs.) If several approaches are used, the data will be
essentially useless for comparative purposes.
</p>
<p>One of the problems for the first NACUBO library project was the failure to
establish clear guidelines for handling multiple campuses and libraries where the
entities have separate operating budgets. For the LMU library there were two
problems. The first was the fact that Loyola Law School has a separate campus,
as well as name, but shares the same governing board as LMU. Rarely does the
institution issue data combining the LMU library with the Law School library;
however, for many institutions such reporting is common. The second issue was
the fact that the LMU library also functions as the university&rsquo;s official archives
and records management unit. Although the holdings are not included in the li-
brary&rsquo;s statistics, the staffing costs and other operating costs are part of the over-
all operating budget.
</p>
<p>Table 3.2 shows the results for two of the 1995 benchmarks for the LMU
library and some of the assessment undertaken based on the tabulated results.
Data supplied after the completion of the study included the individual institu-
tional results, the total average results (also the high and low amounts), and
&ldquo;cohorts&rdquo; based on the Carnegie Classification System for academic institutions.
The system also differentiates between public and privately funded institutions.
Loyola Marymount University falls into the &ldquo;Comprehensive University&rdquo; cate-
gory, thus making that cohort the primary area of concern for the library (al-
though the staff did look at other categories as well). Column A in Table 3.2
shows the &ldquo;cost per library holding&rdquo;&mdash;essentially the total library operating bud-
get divided by total library holdings. Column B represents the total materials ac-
quisition cost as a percentage of library cost. In the first instance, the assumption
was that the lower the number the more efficient, if not necessarily effective, the
library&rsquo;s collection building program was. For the second set of data, a high
number was assumed to be desirable; that is, more of the operating budget went
toward building the collections. Had LMU either included the archives and re-
cords collections as part of its holdings or pulled out those programs&rsquo; operating
costs, the number for LMU in Column A would have been near the bottom of the
Private Comprehensive semi-quartile range, rather than near the top. For the last
NACUBO study, the issues of what to include or not include were much clearer,
</p>

<p>and the expectation is that when the data become available they will be much
more useful.

<p>The benchmarking project discussed here indicated some of the problems
that occur when attempting to compare cost data with other institutions. Al-
though there are potential pitfalls, there is also a value in looking at an institu-
tion&rsquo;s operations in comparison to peer libraries. At the least, if the comparisons
are favorable, there can be a political value in terms of funding authorities
</p>
<p>�&amp;�

</p>
<p>Conducting internal cost studies provides useful data and occasionally re-
veals unexpected insights. Three of the most common reasons for engaging in
such projects are to identify possible cost reduction areas and tasks, to provide
data for cost recovery programs, and to evaluate alternatives for carrying out a
task or activity. Such studies can, and in most cases should, take a pragmatic ap-
proach to data collecting. That is, one should not worry too much about using
complex models or statistical analysis; &ldquo;rules of thumb&rdquo; are generally satisfac-
tory and basic statistics work well for local projects. A good starting point for en-
gaging in such a project is Cost Effective Technical Services: How to Track,
Manage, and Justify Internal Operations.10 Not everyone believes in the value of
such studies, in part because they apparently associate the projects with some of
the worst aspects of &ldquo;scientific management&rdquo; of the early twentieth century. A
balanced discussion touching on the pros and cons of cost studies (although it is
essentially &ldquo;pro&rdquo;) is Joe Hewitt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Using Cost Data Judiciously.&rdquo;11 Hewitt
makes a point that the authors of this book strongly agree with:
</p>
<p>Cost studies are a useful, at times necessary, tool of manage-
ment in libraries. They tend to be used selectively for specific
purposes. In decision making, they are used with sensitivity as
data illuminating a single (albeit important) factor involved in
complex decisions. . . . On the whole, libraries using cost
studies are aware of their limitations and dangers and are at-
tempting to make use of cost studies as tools of rational,
humane management.12
</p>
<p>One example of the &ldquo;complex decisions&rdquo; is whether a library should use an
outsourcing service such as PromptCat. Although the decision involves much
more than fiscal considerations, one strong factor in the decision is whether do-
ing so would provide some form of savings (time or money) or have some other
significant benefit. An article by Mary Rider and Marsha Hamilton discusses fit-
ting cost analysis into a PromptCat decision.13 It includes a long section on
cost/benefit analysis work that was part of a decision-making process. The arti-
cle concludes by stating:
</p>
<p>When considering the PromptCat service, the library should
ideally study local costs and work flow implications. The ser-
vice provides an excellent impetus to review expensive and
time-consuming local practices. . . . Psychological and staffing
</p>
<p>56 3&mdash;Technical Services Administration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>implications should be considered. Many staff and librarians
are concerned about job security and satisfaction in the face
of increasingly sophisticated vendor-supplied services and the
specter of outsourcing. Finally, the increased speed with which
materials can be made available to patrons should be con-
sidered, especially if changes in workflow and local systems
can be adopted to maximize the benefits that PromptCat can
provide.14
</p>
<p>
�(��&amp;���
�**�+&amp;
� �
�&amp;�
</p>
<p>As the previous discussion suggests, cost studies, restructuring, outsourcing,
and so forth can and do have an impact on all staff members. Addressing their con-
cerns requires some understanding of the psychological aspects of the situation at
hand. Restructuring, or even undertaking studies of the existing structure, nor-
mally creates four stages, in which the staff experience
</p>
<p>&bull; Disbelief and denial,
</p>
<p>&bull; Anger, rage, and resentment,
</p>
<p>&bull; Emotional bargaining&mdash;anger to depression, and finally,
</p>
<p>&bull; Acceptance.15
</p>
<p>During the first stage, there is often shock that changes might or will take
place. There is also a belief that the changes cannot or will not work, and some
staff may actively work against the changes. Having the staff involved and al-
lowing them maximum input will help, as will providing honest and forthright
explanations about what is involved in the study or proposed change(s). Indi-
cating the benefits is also helpful. If there will be staff reductions, that should be
made clear to the staff. Trying to hide such facts until later will damage credibil-
ity with the staff.
</p>
<p>Stage two involves denial and shock usually shifting to anger, especially if
there are to be staff reductions that require layoffs rather than &ldquo;normal attrition.&rdquo;
That anger is normally focused on the immediate supervisor rather than the ac-
tual factor making the changes necessary. During the third stage, staff members
likely to be affected by the change begin to start thinking about their options. Oc-
casionally, some resign before there is any final decision. Often, these are the
most qualified individuals who are less likely to lose their positions. Others be-
come depressed, and their work quality and quantity begins to fall. Eventually
there is an acceptance that what seemed unthinkable will in fact take place.
</p>
<p>Susan Cartwright and Cary Cooper identified twelve of the most common
workplace &ldquo;stressors.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s technical services environment appears to have
the potential for the appearance of all twelve factors from time to time. The
stressors are
</p>
<p>&bull; Loss of identity as organizational size changes;
</p>
<p>Tips on Staff Motivation 57</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Lack of information, poor/inconsistent communication;
</p>
<p>&bull; Fear of job loss or demotion;
</p>
<p>&bull; Possible transfer/relocation;
</p>
<p>&bull; Loss of or reduced power, status, and prestige;
</p>
<p>&bull; Disrupted/uncertain career path;
</p>
<p>&bull; Change in rules, regulations, procedures, and reporting structure;
</p>
<p>&bull; Change in colleagues, supervisors, and subordinates;
</p>
<p>&bull; Ambiguous reporting systems, roles, and procedures;
</p>
<p>&bull; Devaluation of old skills and expertise;
</p>
<p>&bull; Personality/workplace culture clashes; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Increased workload.16
</p>
<p>Some of the factors are more controllable than others; for example, work-
load increases are often difficult to control at least in the short term. Some of the
steps to take to reduce the stress were discussed previously. Providing more in-
formation can be very helpful; &ldquo;the word&rdquo; does not always get out as much as
one might assume. Keep the communication process open to feedback; make it
clear that questions and expressions of concern are welcome. Be as specific as
possible about the &ldquo;what&rsquo;s, why&rsquo;s, when&rsquo;s, and wherefore&rsquo;s&rdquo; of events or pro-
jects that may be stressful situations. Involving staff in the process as much as
possible helps them have a sense of control over their destiny. Work at develop-
ing a team approach, if not actual work teams.
</p>
<p>
��+�#"��'��%
</p>
<p>Team is a word with several meanings in the management area; empow-
ered, project, and working are three of the most common delineations. Em-
powered teams have a high degree of autonomy in some activity and are more or
less permanent in character. Such a group might be a retrospective cataloging
team, if they have great latitude to determine their work activities. Project teams
are assembled to carry out a specific task usually with a target completion date.
Such a team might be a PromptCat implementation team. Working teams are
developed by supervisors to improve the cooperation or coordination of work
activities within the areas of responsibility and to involve the staff in more of the
unit&rsquo;s planning and decision-making activities. In the first two types of teams,
there is often a selection process in terms of personnel to be on the team that is
designed to bring to the team all the skills needed to handle the assigned task.
Working teams seldom start with a selection process, but over time the supervi-
sor might adjust job descriptions to bring in new or missing skill sets to improve
the team&rsquo;s performance. No matter what type of team is being considered, most
of the elements of good team building apply.
</p>
<p>Good team building starts with creating two types of matrices: skills and re-
sponsibilities. Even when someone is not in a position to select team members, it
</p>
<p>58 3&mdash;Technical Services Administration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is useful to develop a skills matrix to identify the ideal skill sets. That way, if
there is an opportunity to select a new person, one can quickly rewrite the appro-
priate job description. Such a matrix also helps one think about skill sets that ex-
ist in the work unit for meeting the existing responsibilities. It may even lead to
reassigning duties among the existing staff. Table 3.3, pages 60&ndash;61, illustrates a
simplified responsibility matrix for handling PromptCat.
</p>
<p>�&amp;++"����
�&amp;�����"��
</p>
<p>Given today&rsquo;s work environment, team-based technical service activities
that cut across traditional activity lines are more likely to produce good results.
This is true in part because, to be effective, team-based work groups require em-
phasizing some of the basics of good management practice. Good teams should
have a broad range of skills and be cross-trained; have strong senior management
support; have a greater than traditional latitude in determining work activities;
and, perhaps most essential, be well-informed. Communication with and among
team members is at the heart of good team performance. Therefore, having a
team communication plan that addresses the who, when, what, and how of the
process, based on team input, goes a long way toward building both good perfor-
mance and team spirit.
</p>
<p>Everyone can benefit to some degree from occasionally recalling the funda-
mentals of the communication process&mdash;beyond the need for team building.
People often slip into the habit of thinking of communication as a one-way pro-
cess based on oral and written messages sent and received. To be truly effective,
communication must be based on a two-way feedback process to prevent misun-
derstandings and to clarify points. (Clearly these issues become even more im-
portant when working in a team environment.) Even when remembering that
communication is two-way in nature, people frequently forget the importance of
listening as well as thinking before providing feedback.
</p>
<p>Listening is an art that many of us need to practice more than we do and one
that some individuals never seem to develop. One reason is that we tend to forget
that we can hear at least four times faster than most people normally speak. The
difference between speaking and listening speeds allows ample time for the lis-
tener&rsquo;s mind to &ldquo;wander&rdquo; away from the speaker&rsquo;s message. If in doubt about
this difference, take a few minutes to think carefully about the last lecture or
speech you attended. Did you really only think about the presentation? No
thoughts about the quality of the presentation? No thoughts about what you
needed to do after &ldquo;this is over&rdquo;? No doodles on the page(s) if you were taking
notes? No thoughts about the room, the people, or what the weather was like out-
side? The list could go on and on; the point is that any such thoughts take one&rsquo;s
attention away from the message and illustrate that listening speed was not taxed
to any great extent by the presentation.

<p>Improving listening skills is necessary for effective team performance.
Tips for improving listening include (1) thinking about questions the presenta-
tion brings to mind that need to be raised for clarification; (2) asking for exam-
ples or providing paraphrased feedback during the presentation; (3)
concentrating on what is new, different, or questionable; (4) planning on summa-
rizing points after the presentation, which is a way of concentrating attention on
message and not allowing one&rsquo;s mind to wander off to other matters.
</p>
<p>There is a passive side to the communication process as well as the active
side just discussed. Nonverbal behavior can be almost as important, if not the
most significant part, of the communication process. Speakers and listeners both
&ldquo;pick up&rdquo; on the nonverbal behaviors and may have very different reactions to
those behaviors. Libraries are becoming more and more diverse both in staff and
the end-users served. Communication is a process highly influenced by cultural
and societal factors. Although we are more likely to think about the importance
of our word choice in a diverse environment, we sometimes overlook the non-
verbal issues.
</p>
<p>Three examples illustrate our point about cultural differences and nonver-
bal behavior. Generally in Western European societies, direct eye contact during
a conversation is considered a sign of a listening, open, straightforward, honest
person. Lack of such eye contact suggests just the opposite. However, in other
cultures such eye contact is insulting, disrespectful, and even threatening. Like-
wise, European-based patterns expect some nonverbal signals that the person is
listening, such as nodding in agreement. In some cultures, such behavior is not
expected or is even viewed as presumptuous on the listener&rsquo;s part. Physical
space during a conversation is also a factor. Some societies expect individuals to
be &ldquo;up close and personal,&rdquo; while in others such behavior is viewed as pushy and
rude. Knowing something about the expected communication behavior of the
various cultures represented in the team or workplace can be beneficial for both
overall working relationships and productivity. (A note about diversity: The
LMU PromptCat team consisted of members of the cataloging and acquisitions
departments, with a total of eleven people. In terms of cultural diversity there are
two people from the Philippines, one from India, one from Taiwan, one from
Japan, one Chinese-American, and one Latino, with the balance from Western
European backgrounds. Clearly, to work effectively the team had to address dif-
ferent communication styles.)
</p>
<p>Effective leaders not only must communicate and build team spirit, they
also must exercise influence and possess negotiating skills if they are to consis-
tently inspire high performance. Authority and coercion will only work for a
short while in most of today&rsquo;s work environments. There are several key ele-
ments in exercising influence in general and specifically in teams:
</p>
<p>&bull; Be consistent in what you ask for and what you do.
</p>
<p>&bull; Be certain to follow through on commitments.
</p>
<p>&bull; Be clear about how decisions are made and follow that process.
</p>
<p>62 3&mdash;Technical Services Administration</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Be flexible in your interpersonal style to adjust to the person you are
with, especially your tone of voice and nonverbal behavior when work-
ing with a culturally diverse group.
</p>
<p>Following these guidelines will not resolve every team-based communication
problem, but it will go a long way toward building a work group that has confi-
dence in its leader as well in its other members.
</p>
<p>There are times when influence is not enough, and negotiating will be nec-
essary to achieve the desired results. Negotiating should be, both within the
group and with other units, a process of give and take. Before starting negotia-
tions it is advisable to have a clear understanding of what the various &ldquo;bottom
lines&rdquo; are for all the parties involved, that is, what cannot be modified. In the
workplace setting, there are usually at least three &ldquo;bottom lines.&rdquo; First is the insti-
tutional goal of what must take place&mdash;for example, implementing PromptCat in
a cost-effective manner. Second is a goal the staff desires&mdash;for example, that any
new process must not result in added workload but rather be a replacement. A
third bottom line is that of the leader or supervisor: The outcome must be some-
thing he or she can be comfortable with implementing. Some tips on negotiating
follow:
</p>
<p>&bull; Differentiate between wants, needs, and musts for all sides.
</p>
<p>&bull; Asking high and giving low is expected, but don&rsquo;t be ridiculous about either
end.
</p>
<p>&bull; Conceding something, which is necessary if there is to be negotiation, is
also expected, but when doing so don&rsquo;t &ldquo;give in.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; Winning something and losing something is the goal of negotiations; no
side should leave believing it has been &ldquo;taken&rdquo; or lost on every issue.

<p>The management issues in today&rsquo;s technical services environment are es-
sentially the same as for other areas of the library: too much to do, too few people
to do what must be done, and constant pressure to &ldquo;do more with less.&rdquo; Basic
management practices are key elements in making the &ldquo;more, faster, better,
cheaper&rdquo; pressures somewhat more manageable. There are a host of manage-
ment resources available for technical services staffs to consult. We were only
able to cover a few of the topics in this chapter; management of organizations in

<p>It does not appear likely that the library work environment is going to
change much from the present circumstances in the very near future. Concepts of
time and stress management are helpful for all staff. Developing ways of sorting
out what is essential, desirable, and &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; with all staff members is also
worthwhile. Creating even an informal sense of team membership prevents
members from feeling as if they are alone. Working on communication and

</p>
<p>Over the years, a great deal of printer&rsquo;s ink has been expended on books and
articles addressing some aspect of library cooperation or consortia activities. If
there were a direct correlation between the volume of literature and actual coop-
erative activities, there would be little left in the way of independent library ac-
tivities. Such is not the case, although libraries do have an admirable record of
both trying grand cooperative programs and succeeding in cooperative ventures.
This chapter provides a brief history of the major cooperative ventures, as well as
looking at current programs that have an impact on technical services.
</p>
<p>#��$%�&amp;"�'���'����
&amp;�)
</p>
<p>A great many efforts at cooperative activities have taken place at the local,
regional, national, and even international levels. This chapter briefly covers
three of the major efforts; two successful and one unsuccessful. Without doubt,
the most successful has been the interlibrary loan program, which is international
in scope. Another highly successful cooperative project is OCLC. The unsuc-
cessful effort is the Farmington Plan and its European counterpart, the
SCANDIA Plan. Why cover worthy efforts if they didn&rsquo;t succeed? Primarily be-
cause of why they failed and how the basic concept underlying the plan is now
returning in a new form. The new form may affect acquisitions activities in the
future.
</p>
<p>Before going into the history and background of cooperative/consortia pro-
grams we should briefly address what we mean by cooperation and describe typ-
ical models for library cooperation. Library cooperative initiatives of interest in
this book fall into one of two categories; sharing staff workloads or expanding
library resources (resource sharing). Webster&rsquo;s Third New International Dictio-
nary defines cooperative as &ldquo;given to or marked by working together or by joint
effort toward a common end&rdquo;; it defines coordinate as &ldquo;to bring into a common
action, movement, or condition; regulate and combine in harmonious action.&rdquo;1
Cooperative resource sharing programs are likely to continue to grow in scope

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and size. There may even be a future for true coordinated collection develop-
ment. Some years ago, John N. Berry III editorialized in Library Journal about
how the then-current tight funding situation was causing cooperative ventures to
cease:
</p>
<p>The pressure is reported by public, academic, and school librar-
ians from across the United States. One state&rsquo;s fine multitype
systems are near collapse. Cooperative county systems in an-
other have been reduced to bickering disarray from years of
no-growth funding. Consortia members are scrapping over
slices of a shrinking pie. New, harsh limitations on interlibrary
loan crop up. Stiff nonresident fees and interlibrary charges
proliferate. Old battles between small and large libraries in
shared jurisdictions flare anew. State agency and cooperative
system operating budgets are openly attacked by constituent li-
brarians. . . . Librarians, torn between professional commitment
to library cooperation and local pressure to provide service
with deeply diminished resources, have to make the choice to
cut service to outsiders.2
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the situation has not improved much since Berry wrote those
words.
</p>
<p>Today, what seems to be the most likely outcome of e-resources and coop-
erative efforts is best described as resource sharing. ALA&rsquo;s Glossary defines re-
source sharing as &ldquo;activities engaged in jointly by a group of libraries for the
purposes of improving services and/or cutting costs. Resource sharing may be
established by informal or formal agreement or by contract and may operate lo-
cally, nationally, or internationally. The resources shared may be collections,
bibliographic data, personnel, planning activities, etc.&rdquo;3 That definition is broad
enough to allow for almost any activity.
</p>
<p>There are four general models for library cooperative projects. Model 1 is a
bilateral exchange model, in which two or more participating libraries exchange
materials or services. In practice, libraries calculate the exchange rate according
to some agreed-upon value (for example, one for one, two for one); frequently,
there is an annual review of the actual results as part of the formal exchange
agreement. All of Loyola Marymount University&rsquo;s reciprocal borrowing agree-
ments with other libraries contain an annual review clause. A number of regional
resource sharing plans exist that employ this model; OHIOLink, and California&rsquo;s
LINK+ are examples, as is the traditional interlibrary loan program.
</p>
<p>Model 2, a multilateral development of Model 1, is the pooling model. In
this model, two or more libraries contribute to and draw from a common pool of
materials. Many of the early cooperative library systems were of this type; in a
sense, OCLC started as a pool.
</p>
<p>In Model 3, the dual service model, two or more participating libraries take
advantage of the facilities of one of the participants to produce a common out-
put&mdash;for instance, a shared online public access catalog (OPAC). The term dual
service distinguishes this model from the next and emphasizes the fact that all
</p>
<p>68 4&mdash;Cooperation/Consortia and Technical Services</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>participants, including the facilitator, contribute to the common output. Many
of the early library systems evolved into this type; frequently, they refer to the
facilitator as the flagship library.
</p>
<p>In Model 4, the service center model, a number of libraries employ the ser-
vices of a facilitating organization to input and process materials for the individ-
ual libraries, rather than for common output. Today&rsquo;s OCLC/WLN is this type.
</p>
<p>These four types are adequate to cover all existing systems; however, new
systems under consideration may not fit this classification system. For informa-
tion about Canadian cooperatives, see http://novanet.ns.ca/consort.
</p>
<p>Library cooperative systems operate on a series of assumptions. Perhaps
the most important, although the one least often stated, is that all of the partici-
pants in the system are or will be equally efficient in their operations involving
the cooperative activities. Another assumption is that every member will achieve
somewhat different benefits or contribute materials that are of greater or lesser
value to the overall project. A third assumption is that each library is somewhat
unusual, if not unique (that is, each library has different clientele, collections,
and service programs). If the last point is valid, why then assume that each partic-
ipant is equally efficient? It is clear that one cannot legitimately make such an
assumption about efficient operations. However, if libraries do not make that
assumption, it is difficult to believe that every library will gain something, or, at
least, receive a value equal to its contribution. Each library hopes that it will
receive more than it puts into the system. If a library enters into a cooperative
program with the &ldquo;something for nothing&rdquo; goal in mind, there is little hope of
success. During periods of low funding from outside sources, libraries have a
tendency not to cooperate. According to Boyd Rayward, &ldquo;Networks (coopera-
tives) are a phenomenon of relative affluence. They cannot be created unless
each member at the local level has sufficient resources of time, staff, materials,
and basic equipment and supplies to participate.&rdquo;4 It is worth remembering that
OCLC started and became established during a high point in library funding in
the United States.
</p>
<p>The following sections examine some of the efforts libraries have made in
the past to address the end-user&rsquo;s insatiable desire for more information, begin-
ning with how libraries have changed as technology has opened up new tech-
niques for satisfying the user&rsquo;s need for more and faster service.

<p>For many years academic and research libraries around the world attempted
to achieve an impossible goal: complete self-sufficiency. Users still clamor for
more and more local resources&mdash;print and electronic&mdash;no matter how large the
existing collections may be. The authors have worked in a variety of libraries,
from the newly established to the &ldquo;Harvards&rdquo; of the library world. In almost
every case, end-users, if asked, would say &ldquo;there are serious gaps in the collec-
tion that ought to be filled&rdquo; or &ldquo;we need more journals.&rdquo; Services such as interli-
brary loan (ILL) have been viewed as unsatisfactory solutions to the problem,
most often on the grounds that they are too slow.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>During the post&ndash;World War II period in the United States, academic librar-
ies made a major effort to make the country, if not the local collections, self-
sufficient. The Farmington Plan was a valiant but unsuccessful effort to have at
least one copy of any currently published research work available somewhere in
the United States, regardless of where in the world it was published. After years
of effort the plan was abandoned in the 1970s. It originally assigned acquisition
responsibility on the basis of institutional interests. In twenty years, those inter-
ests changed, but the goal of having one copy remained. Another problem was
that some topics were not a major area of interest to any institution. Sufficient na-
tional interest existed to warrant coverage, but deciding which institution should
have the responsibility for buying such materials was a constant problem.
</p>
<p>A careful study of why the Farmington Plan failed provides invaluable data
for future cooperative ventures. Technical services units were often flooded with
materials of low interest and low priority for processing. Near the end of the pro-
gram libraries unboxed Farmington Plan shipments, checked the packing slip
against the invoice, assigned a special number to each box, and repacked the
material, shipping it off to a storage facility. In the final analysis, the plan failed
due to ever-changing institutional interests as well as lack of staff to process the
materials acquired so researchers would know the material was available. An-
other problem at the time was knowing where one might find the material, be-
cause there were only the traditional card catalog and a few book catalogs for a
some of the largest academic libraries and the Library of Congress.
</p>
<p>A European example of a similar effort was the SCANDIA Plan, imple-
mented in the Scandinavian countries, which experienced similar problems. This
plan never achieved the same level of activity as the Farmington Plan, primarily
because of problems of changing needs and the assignment of responsibilities.
</p>
<p>Some years ago Bendik Rugaas, the national librarian of Norway, pre-
sented a paper titled &ldquo;The End of All and Forever&rdquo; at a meeting of national librar-
ians.5 In that paper, Rugaas outlined the reasons why no national library could
hope to collect and preserve all the information materials created within its
country&rsquo;s boundaries. All the participating librarians agreed that this was an
impossible task. Evidence that national libraries are starting to act on that knowl-
edge appeared in the lead article of the September 19, 1994, Library Hotline. The
article stated that the British Library was giving up the goal of collecting every
edition of every book, magazine, and journal printed in Great Britain.
</p>
<p>If the giants of the library world are giving up local self-sufficiency, what
can other libraries of more modest means hope to accomplish? Librarians know
there always will be items a client will someday need but the library does not
have the funds to buy. Librarians know that self-sufficiency is an unattainable
goal, along with the goal of the &ldquo;perfect catalog.&rdquo; However, user pressure keeps
libraries seeking new means of coming closer to the impossible just as they con-
tinue to improve the public catalog. Almost all the efforts are some form of inter-
library loan or document delivery system to fill most of the gaps.

<p>Interlibrary loan (ILL) exemplifies both the problems and success of coop-
erative efforts. It is the process by which a borrower in one library obtains the use
of books, periodical articles, or other library materials from another, sometimes
distant, library. In ILL&rsquo;s simplest form, one branch of a large public library
might borrow a book from the central library for the benefit of a requesting bor-
rower. A more complex transaction might be a researcher requesting a filmed or
paper copy of a medieval manuscript from an overseas library. In either case,
aside from the number of steps in each procedure and the needed expertise of the
parties involved, the goal and overall activities are basically the same.
</p>
<p>Document delivery is a growing service that supplements the traditional in-
terlibrary loan program. Document delivery involves purchasing information
sources (especially periodical articles) from commercial document suppliers
when access from other libraries is either unavailable or too slow. Document de-
livery is sometimes preferred over traditional interlibrary loan because of its
timeliness; some commercial suppliers deliver most requested items within
twenty-four hours or less; more rapidly than interlibrary loan can accommodate.
However, a number of studies have shown that turnaround time for most docu-
ment suppliers is no faster than the average interlibrary loan turnaround time. In
addition, document suppliers often charge between U.S. $10 and $15 per item
plus copyright fees of U.S. $3 to $7, making the service too expensive for many
libraries.6 Some libraries use document delivery to stretch their materials bud-
gets by supplying information to their customers in lieu of subscribing to
low-use or expensive periodicals. In many libraries document delivery became
part of the interlibrary loan department, which in many cases led to a name
change for the unit that is some variation of &ldquo;document delivery services.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>According to the annals of U.S. library history, ILL began in the early
1900s and was first codified in 1917. Cooperative loaning of materials from li-
brary to library in Western Europe, however, goes back at least as far as early
medieval times, if not to the Middle Ages. Monasteries often loaned their books
for copying to the scriptoria of other monasteries, sometimes hundreds of miles
distant. These libraries sometimes never recovered the loaned materials, due to
the exigencies of medieval travel, warfare, fire, barbarian raids, and the occa-
sional thief. On the whole, libraries fare much better today regarding materials
loaned to other libraries, although problems occur and materials do not get
returned.
</p>
<p>An active ILL program is a significant commitment of library resources. A
1997 study of ILL costs in the United States revealed average borrowing costs of
$18.35 per item for research libraries and $12.08 for college libraries, as well as
lending costs of $9.48 for research and $7.25 for college libraries. Approxi-
mately two-thirds of the cost of ILL is staff time.7 Each library must make deci-
sions about which services to emphasize based on its mission and priorities.
There are some libraries that do little ILL work because it might cripple their
basic services. A few get around the problem by borrowing from others but limit-
ing the amount of their lending. Because good faith cooperation between librar-
ies is the basis of interlibrary loan, this is acceptable only in the case of true
</p>
<p>Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery 71</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>financial distress. Interlibrary loan requires staff time for patron contact, verifi-
cation, searching, communicating, record keeping forms, shipping, computer or
telecommunications, packaging, furniture and space, and billing costs.
</p>
<p>At the same time, ILL saves some money. Libraries can borrow (just in
time) rarely used items rather than having to purchase them (just in case). Many
libraries belong to networks formed for the purpose of facilitating interlibrary
borrowing. Access to information becomes a matter of not only what one library
can purchase but what subject strengths all participating libraries can provide.
Libraries in a region can divide subject specializations within the group. Instead
of each library collecting thinly in all areas, a solid basic collection can be built in
each library, while those with particular subject strengths or needs can build an
in-depth or special collection in one or two areas. Rarely used expensive vol-
umes, sets, or specialized periodical subscriptions will be bought only by the
most appropriate library, but access is maintained for the users of all participants.
There are specific institutions that have as their mission the lending of materials
to other libraries, as others have as their mission the preservation of last or only
copies. Examples of these are the British Lending Library and the Center for
Research Libraries, respectively.
</p>
<p>Such schemes might lead one to believe that large university research li-
braries or large public libraries would be drained by many smaller libraries nib-
bling away at their substance. In fact, when the number of loans both ways is
tallied, many of the smaller college and public libraries wind up being net lend-
ers to, rather than borrowers from, larger libraries. Smaller libraries often have
local materials and collections that are desired by customers of larger institu-
tions, and smaller institutions often have a faster turnaround time, making them
preferred lenders.
</p>
<p>Interlibrary loan can remove the limitations of borrower location and is thus
inherently democratic. Should rural borrowers be denied access to knowledge
because of their physical distance from research centers? Should scholars have
to drive or fly hundreds of miles to see a particular book? Should foreign-born or
non-English-speaking customers be denied access to library books in their native
language because they do not live in the right part of town? Should immobilized
citizens be unable to read where their interests lead them because they cannot
travel across town? Interlibrary loan solves many more problems than it creates,
removing barriers to information and knowledge across all levels.
</p>
<p>Herein lies the reason for covering ILL in a book on technical services. The
services are only as good as the public catalogs. Participants must know which
library has a copy of the desired material. Knowing if the item in question is
available assists in speeding up the process by directing the request to a library
that has a copy available for loan, which implies that the catalog reflects the sta-
tus of the item. Part of the &ldquo;slowness&rdquo; of ILL in the past was the fact that borrow-
ing libraries did not know the availability and might have to send the request to
several institutions before locating a copy they could borrow. Today OPACs can
provide such information almost instantaneously.
</p>
<p>An interesting outcome of more and more libraries having OPACs and be-
ing part of regional or statewide networks is that the large libraries are actually
borrowing more material from smaller institutions than they are lending. This
</p>
<p>72 4&mdash;Cooperation/Consortia and Technical Services</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>suggests that in the past it was lack of information rather than weak collections
that led to the imbalance in ILL activity. In 1993, the library directors at U.S. Jesuit
colleges and universities completed an agreement after three years of discussion
about concerns that the large libraries would be overused by their smaller col-
leagues. As of early 2001, the amount of borrowing was not a burden for any
institution. In fact, some of the smaller libraries say their small document deliv-
ery staff face an increasing workload from the &ldquo;big&rdquo; schools.
</p>
<p>At the international level is the ambitious UNESCO program, Universal
Availability of Publications (UAP). Although it is not actually a cooperative col-
lection development plan or ILL, it must be mentioned. In concept, UAP is
grand. It proposes that all published knowledge, in whatever form it is produced,
should be available to anyone whenever he or she wants it. Every information
professional knows there is a long way to go in achieving that goal, and it is prob-
ably not attainable, even in countries with strong library systems and economies,
let alone in developing countries. As Maurice Line has stated:
</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why the situation with regard to UAP
is so unsatisfactory is that availability has been approached
piecemeal; particular aspects such as acquisitions and
interlending have been tackled by individual libraries or groups
of libraries, but uncoordinated piecemeal approaches can actu-
ally make things worse. . . . UAP must ultimately depend on ac-
tion with individual countries.8
</p>
<p>If the concept is to succeed, it will be necessary to develop coordinated collec-
tion development plans in all countries and effective delivery systems, because
everyone cannot buy, process, and store everything everywhere.
</p>
<p>Groups, associations, and networks bring us to another aspect of coopera-
tion. The linking of libraries through electronic networks and how such pro-
grams also help in sharing the ever-increasing workload of technical services is
another story.

<p>By the mid-1960s in the United States, with the availability of federal
funds, libraries had established a variety of local cooperative programs. Some of
these projects explored the possibilities of &ldquo;centralized processing.&rdquo; An old but
still valid definition of centralized processing is &ldquo;those steps whereby library
materials for several independent libraries, either by contract or informal agree-
ment, are ordered, cataloged, and physically prepared for use by library patrons.&rdquo; 9
(Clearly the concept of outsourcing technical services has a long history, as this
statement appeared in 1964.)
</p>
<p>Many states had one or more such centers by the end of the 1960s. When the
Ohio College Association hired Wyman Parker to develop a cooperative center
in 1963, no one imagined this would lead to the world&rsquo;s largest bibliographic
database by the twenty-first century. Like many such projects, it started with the
premise that the association needed a union catalog.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Certainly government funding was a key element in the move toward coop-
erative technical processing; however, computer technology was equally critical
in making the projects succeed. Cooperatives seemed to appear overnight in the
1960s at all levels, from local to national. As OCLC began to take on a national
service character with its online bibliographic database, it started offering a vari-
ety of technical services to members. There was less need to maintain union cata-
logs for current titles, at least for libraries using OCLC. However, in most cases
libraries only added current cataloging and holdings information to the database,
so there was still a strong need for union lists for older titles.
</p>
<p>National databases such as OCLC serve a number of functions. Catalog de-
partments can use data in the system to assist in cataloging activities or, if the
item matches the data, simply add the library&rsquo;s identification code to the data-
base record. By adding the code to the record (creating a holdings statement),
member libraries know who owns what. Selection officers and interlibrary loan
staff can use the holdings information in their work. As mentioned in Chapter 2,
acquisitions departments can download bibliographic records into their auto-
mated order systems and save staff time by not having to rekey the information.
</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, large libraries contributed their original cata-
loging to the database, which was largely dependent on the Library of Con-
gress&rsquo;s cataloging in the form of MARC tapes. Increasingly the term used for
this activity was shared cataloging, reflecting the fact that many libraries con-
tributed data to the database.
</p>
<p>Larger libraries also were actively developing computer-based systems for
most of their basic activities. By the 1980s, national database services (also
known as bibliographic utilities), commercial vendors, and some large libraries
were offering automation packages to libraries. One frequent requirement was to
provide linkages to national databases while allowing the library to fully catalog
items just using the local system. Today there is a move back toward local pro-
cessing. Many libraries download data from the network to their systems but do
not always add to the national database. Jo Ann Segal has noted in her article on
library networking that &ldquo;another area of consensus was that the greatest threat to
networks is the defection of members that come to rely on local systems and opti-
cally stored databases, rather than contribute shared cataloging.&rdquo;10 An article by
Sheila Intner outlines the issues in the trend toward less-shared cataloging.11
</p>
<p>The relationship between national and local or regional networks can be
confusing. If a library uses OCLC, for example, why does it also have to have
some connection with a regional group such as SOLINET or PACNET (South-
eastern Library Network, and the OCLC Pacific Network, respectively)?
</p>

</p>
<p>Currently there are two national nonprofit online bibliographic networks in
the United States: OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) and RLG (Research
Libraries Group). Each system started as an online cataloging project but over
time added other services. Both provide an ILL component. However, catalog-
ing is still one of the most important aspects of their programs. (Additional dis-
cussion of online cataloging is in Chapter 21.)

<p>A-G Canada Ltd.
</p>
<p>A-G Canada Ltd. and AMICUS are the two primary suppliers of biblio-
graphic data in Canada. The roots of A-G Canada Ltd. began in 1965 when the
University of Toronto Library became involved in an internal effort to automate
its cataloging operations. This work resulted in the establishment of UTLAS
(University of Toronto Library Automation Systems). UTLAS eventually sepa-
rated from the university and was acquired by Thomson Canada Ltd., a multina-
tional communications corporation, which changed its name to Utlas
International Canada. In 1992 Utlas was purchased by ISM Information Systems
Management Corporation, which changed its name, once again, to ISM Library
Information Services. It is presently owned by Auto-Graphics of Pomona, Cali-
fornia, and now operates as A-G Canada Ltd.
</p>
<p>A-G Canada offers resource sharing, cataloging services, and proprietary
database management with access to and from the database through Z39.50
search and retrieval protocol and World Wide Web facilities. A-G Canada&rsquo;s
database design differs from OCLC&rsquo;s. Customers have a choice of maintaining a
separate file of their own holdings or attaching their holdings to an existing file.
Libraries and media centers do not join A-G Canada as members with a voice in
its governance but purchase products and services from it as would the cus-
tomers of any other commercial company.
</p>
<p>A-G Canada is programmed to support English and French bilingual data-
bases containing Canadian and Universit&eacute; de Laval French-language subject
headings as well as LCSH (Library of Congress Subject Headings). Its database
includes catalog records from many sources, such as the National Library of
Canada, the Library of Congress, and the U.S. National Library of Medicine, as
well as the REMARC file containing 4 million records from the pre-1968
Library of Congress shelflist. The National Library of Canada has designated
A-G Canada as a node on the NLC-sponsored Virtual Canadian Union Cata-
logue (vCuc). As of July 2001, A-G Canada had a database of over 50 million
bibliographic and authority records representing the collections of more than
600 libraries.
</p>
<p>One of the differences between A-G Canada and OCLC is that A-G Can-
ada&rsquo;s authority control system links bibliographic records with records in LC&rsquo;s
name and subject authority files, the National Library of Medicine&rsquo;s MeSH
(Medical Subject Headings) file, the National Library of Canada&rsquo;s name file, and
R&eacute;pertoire de vedettes-mati&egrave;re, permitting a local library&rsquo;s own authority files to
be maintained and used in conjunction with all these authority files.
</p>
<p>AMICUS
</p>
<p>It is essential that the National Library of Canada (NLC) provide access in
both of Canada&rsquo;s official languages, English and French. AMICUS, a free
Web-based service that replaced DOBIS in 1995, provides bilingual access to
the holdings of the National Library and more than 500 Canadian libraries. As of
April 1, 2001, there were over 1,100 institutions subscribing to the service.
</p>
<p>Major Online Bibliographic Services 75</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AMICUS is considered the premier collection of Canadiana in the world.
The relational database contained 22 million bibliographic records as of April 1,
2001, and it is growing at an annual rate of nearly 1 million records. Because cus-
tomized products are produced only for a small number of clients, AMICUS
calls itself a resource sharing database rather than a bibliographic utility. In addi-
tion to bibliographic records created by NLC and the Library of Congress, there
are holdings from more than 500 Canadian libraries that contribute to NLC&rsquo;s
Canadian union catalog. Subscribers can download records free of charge, create
bibliographies, and order items from other AMICUS contributors via an ILL
feature.
</p>
<p>AMICUS also contains NLC&rsquo;s name authority file, subject authorities for
Canadian Subject Headings, and authorities created online. The authorities,
which are MARC 21 compatible, can be searched by name, title, subject, and
control number. The data include scope notes for subject headings and informa-
tion and history notes for name headings as well as cross-references.
</p>
<p>AMICUS records are used to produce many widely distributed products,
such as Canada&rsquo;s national bibliography, Canadiana, Canadiana Authorities,
several union lists, and catalogs. NLC also offers a MARC Records Distribution
Service (MRDS). Records selected by local libraries are available on a
twenty-four-hour turnaround batch basis via file transfer and other methods. In
addition, NLC can supply acquisition lists, bibliographies, and related items.
</p>
<p>OCLC
</p>
<p>As noted previously, OCLC&rsquo;s origins go back to the 1960s when a group of
Ohio academic libraries wanted to investigate the possibility of establishing a
cooperative processing center. The project quickly developed from a &ldquo;simple
union catalog&rdquo; concept into a total service center. Frederick G. Kilgour began
work on transforming the concept into a working reality in 1967. Since its incep-
tion, the acronym OCLC has served as the shorthand label for a variety of official
organizational names. Initially the name was Ohio College Library Center; today
the name is OCLC: Online Computer Library Center, Inc. There was even a brief
period when the name was just OCLC, Inc.
</p>
<p>Online access to OCLC&rsquo;s database began in 1971, and shared online cata-
loging was initiated. The process of participating in OCLC is relatively simple.
A member library either adds new bibliographic material to the database (origi-
nal cataloging) or adds its three-letter OCLC code to an existing bibliographic
record. This three-letter code lets other OCLC member libraries know which
other libraries own or hold that item; this is called holdings information or the
holdings symbol. (The codes for two of the authors&rsquo; libraries are LML [Loyola
Marymount University] and SCL [Simmons College].) During OCLC&rsquo;s first
decade of operation as a bibliographic utility, most members used it to acquire
catalog cards. By the 1980s, more members had local online public access cata-
logs (OPACs), which meant they no longer needed to buy cards. This resulted
in a decline in income for OCLC, which affected the pricing structure of OCLC
</p>
<p>76 4&mdash;Cooperation/Consortia and Technical Services</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>services. Furthermore, as noted previously, some members no longer contribute
bibliographic records or holdings information.
</p>
<p>OCLC&rsquo;s database grew quickly and continues to grow at an impressive
rate. It took about three years for the database to reach the 1 million-record level;
by its tenth anniversary it had reached over 8 million. Sometime in 1993 it sur-
passed the 28 million mark. By mid-2001, there were more than 48 million re-
cords. Annual growth is between 1.6 million and 1.9 million records.
</p>
<p>The database contains records for audiovisual materials, books, computer
files, government documents, manuscripts, maps, microforms, music scores, serials,
sound recordings, and videorecordings. More than 30 percent of the records are
for non-English-language materials. Such a rich bibliographic database is valu-
able not only for cataloging purposes but also for collection development and
ILL activities.
</p>
<p>Several times during its history OCLC offered members packages for auto-
mating acquisitions and serials control work. Today, commercial vendors offer
more complete packages for automating library activities at lower overall oper-
ating costs. OCLC now focuses on its database as a source for supporting and en-
hancing cataloging, ILL activities, and other types of access services. One such
enhancement was the development of a workstation that can handle Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean characters. Another change was the move to using micro-
computers rather than dumb terminals connected to a mainframe computer to ac-
cess the system. This change allows libraries greater flexibility and frees them
from the need to acquire and use expensive equipment. In the area of public ser-
vices, there is FirstSearch, which is a collection of online reference databases, as
well as a number of CD-ROM products.
</p>
<p>Although OCLC is a nonprofit organization, it still must recover its full op-
erating expenses. This means there are substantial usage fees that each member
incurs for most services. There are several exceptions to the use charges. OCLC
gives a credit for each original cataloging record contributed to the system by a
library and for filling an ILL request. The other exception is a credit for deleting
a holdings symbol. This occurs when a library withdraws an item from its collec-
tions and deletes its holdings symbol from the bibliographic record in OCLC.
Access to the network is either dial-up using a public data network or, for
high-volume usage, via a private telecommunications network (a &ldquo;dedicated
line&rdquo;) as well as Internet connectivity. In either case there are telecommunication
charges in addition to the various service usage costs. A medium-sized library
can easily spend between U.S. $30,000 and $40,000 per year on OCLC services,
the bulk of which will be the result of technical services activities. All of the on-
line databases generate similar costs; they are not unique to OCLC. Having the
staff become proficient in using the bibliographic utility the library belongs to is
clearly important to the financial well-being of the library.
</p>
<p>At the time it started operating, OCLC&rsquo;s name reflected the academic li-
brary composition of the founding group. Soon, membership became open to
any type of library. In 2001 there were more than 38,000 participating libraries of
all types located in many countries around the world. An example of the interna-
tional character of OCLC is the successful effort started in 1988 between the
National Library of Canada and OCLC to develop an electronic ILL system
</p>
<p>Major Online Bibliographic Services 77</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>drawing on the resources of both organizations. Another project is with the British
Library (BL), which announced that libraries in Great Britain and Northern Ire-
land would have access to OCLC through an interface with BL&rsquo;s BLAISE ser-
vice. During 1989, OCLC established an international office to handle its
operations in twenty-six countries. Eleven years later more than sixty countries
were participating.
</p>
<p>Over the years a number of articles have appeared outlining various weak-
nesses of OCLC. However, so far OCLC has stood the test of time and is a good
example of successful library cooperation. Nonetheless, there are problems with
OCLC that may affect daily work. One is that sometimes more than one record
for a particular item exists in the database, and these records may contain signifi-
cantly different information. Another issue is that the quality of some contrib-
uted cataloging is poor, so poor that some libraries only accept cataloging
contributed by the Library of Congress and major libraries known for their qual-
ity cataloging. These problems arose because OCLC is a shared cataloging data-
base. Any member may input a new cataloging record at any time. Although
there are guidelines and standards for inputting new records, quality control is
difficult to maintain. OCLC makes a conscious effort at quality control, how-
ever, and corrects master records whenever errors are reported. With the imple-
mentation of PRISM, improvements were made to the software that make it
easier to find and update records globally, such as when a subject heading
changes. For most libraries the high &ldquo;hit rate&rdquo; (number of items found) and the
overall quality of the database counterbalance its weaknesses.
</p>
<p>One aspect of OCLC that is difficult for newcomers to the field to under-
stand is its management operating procedure. Why does one sometimes call a re-
gional service center rather than OCLC when there is a problem with the system?
Early in its development as a national network, OCLC and most of the existing
regional networks developed an operating agreement related to marketing their
system. In very simple terms, OCLC sets overall directions for the system and
develops products and services. The regional networks serve as the distributors
of the products and services as well as providing the training needed to use the
system effectively. Currently there are twenty such networks; the list can be
viewed online at http://www.oclc.org/contacts/regional.
</p>
<p>Part of the problem in understanding OCLC&rsquo;s arrangement is that there are
three types of regional network distributors affiliated with it. One type is the
pre-OCLC cooperative such as BCR, located in Colorado, which was a local and
regional program that existed when OCLC began to go national with its system.
Such networks are administratively independent of OCLC. The second type is a
network created by a group of libraries specifically to distribute OCLC services;
an example is OHIONET. These networks are independent organizations, but
their original purpose ties them more closely to OCLC than is the case with the
first type. The third type, represented by PACNET, is an OCLC-created and con-
trolled regional network. OCLC set up PACNET because the West Coast did not
create its own network.
</p>
<p>Although the OCLC distribution system is similar to the retail model of
manufacturer, distributors, and customers, there is one exception: There is a high
degree of shared governance in OCLC. There is a Regional OCLC Network
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Directors Advisory Committee (RONDAC) as well as a users&rsquo; council.
RONDAC looks after the interests and concerns of the networks; the users&rsquo;
council is where member libraries&rsquo; voices are heard. The council must ratify all
amendments to OCLC&rsquo;s Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations. This
body also elects six of its members to serve on the OCLC board of trustees. All of
this means that the users have a strong voice in what OCLC does and does not do
as well as in how it operates. This brief description only highlights major aspects
of OCLC governance and operations. Irene Hoadley&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;The Future of
Networks and OCLC,&rdquo; provides a good starting point for anyone wishing to
learn more about this topic.12
</p>
<p>Research Libraries Group/
Research Libraries Information
</p>
<p>Network (RLIN&reg;)
</p>
<p>The twenty-first-century RLG/RLIN&reg; is very different from what is was in
its early days. It is not completely clear where the process will end. It is unlikely
that it will cease offering cataloging services to its members, but it may not ac-
tively market the services to libraries in general. The majority of its development
activities will probably focus on databases of interest to scholars. In short, RLG
has realized that the library technical services market cannot support RLIN&reg; as a
direct general competitor of OCLC.
</p>
<p>Like other networks, the original purpose of RLG was to establish a joint
program to improve access to scholarly material. The founding group consisted
of Columbia, Harvard, New York Public Library, and Yale. After several years
of looking at alternatives for developing a computer-based bibliographic data-
base, the group signed a contract with Stanford University to use its BALLOTS
system in 1978. (BALLOTS is an acronym for Bibliographic Automation of
Large Library Operations using a Time Sharing System.) BALLOTS then be-
came RLIN&reg;. Ten years later, there were thirty-six governing members and al-
most 200 associate, special, or affiliated members. All the members were
research libraries or libraries with specialized areas of interest, such as the Getty
Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Los Angeles. As in other
cooperative networks, there is a sharing of governance among member libraries.
</p>
<p>In all of the RLIN&reg; technical processing services there is a strong empha-
sis on quality control and the needs of researchers. Libraries have greater control
over their data than is the case with OCLC. Each library develops its own profile
for cataloging activities. Because of a desire to help control the costs of building
large research collections, the in-process file control system is an important ele-
ment in RLIN&reg;. One of the strong points of the system is the name authority file.
RLIN&reg; divides its bibliographic database into eight files: archives/manuscript
control, books, films, maps, recordings, scores, serials, and visual materials.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Like OCLC, RLG has realized that it must move in the direction of becom-
ing an information provider rather than just a technical services tool and has
placed more emphasis on specialized services and information. It has developed
Eureka&reg;, which provides direct access to all the union catalog databases that
RLG provides, and CitaDel&reg;, a citation database. Another database from RLG is
AMICO&trade; Library (Art Museum Image Consortium) database, a multimedia
resource of more than 78,000 digitized and cataloged works of art from leading
museums. RLG clearly focuses on the needs of the large or highly specialized
research library.

</p>
<p>One of the benefits that can arise from any library cooperative effort is the
potential for improving access for end users&mdash;improving in the sense of making
available a greater range of materials or better depth in a subject area. We noted
previously that lack of information about holdings was a problem in the past for
ILL &ldquo;resource sharing.&rdquo; This has become less of a problem as libraries automate
their catalogs, join various networks, and move to Web-based distribution. Some
resource sharing networks are statewide, such as OHIOLINK and LINK+ in Cal-
ifornia, which include both public and private institutions.
</p>
<p>Loyola Marymount University library joined LINK+ in 1999, with the
result that its service population went from having access to a collection of just
over 400,000 volumes to having online access to a collection of more than 4 mil-
lion titles and 6 million copies. Although the LMU collection was the smallest
added to the database up to that time, over 37 percent of the items were unique
additions to the system. (Each new member contributes between 30 percent and
40 percent unique titles, according to the firm that handles both OHIOLINK and
LINK+. This suggests that to some degree the claim that each library is &ldquo;special&rdquo;
is true, at least in terms of its collections.)
</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s electronic world there are ways to address some of the classic
concerns about ILL service. Projects like OHIOLINK and LINK+ provide quick
delivery of materials; in both cases member libraries have a courier service that
picks up and delivers items every day. David Kohl has listed five key factors that
need to be in place for successful resource sharing:
</p>
<p>&bull; Libraries belong to a consortium,
</p>
<p>&bull; Libraries have both their catalogs and circulation components integrated
and available online,
</p>
<p>&bull; Libraries provide prompt physical delivery of print materials,
</p>
<p>80 4&mdash;Cooperation/Consortia and Technical Services</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Libraries have online delivery of electronic resources, and
</p>
<p>&bull; Libraries develop a coordinated/integrated collection development
program.13
</p>
<p>The list is more or less in order of priority: joint collection building after li-
braries demonstrate they can quickly satisfy users&rsquo; demands for materials not
held locally. Two of the key issues are of concern to technical services staff.
These issues are becoming increasingly important in the electronic information
world.
</p>
<p>Based on LMU&rsquo;s experience, the promise of delivery of an item within
twenty-four hours is kept by the courier service whether it is from a library in San
Diego or one in Sacramento. The process begins by a person looking up an item
in the local OPAC. If that library does not own the item the person may, with a
single keystroke, search the LINK+ database. If a copy of the item is available in
a member library, the person can fill out an online request form, and the system
verifies that the individual is a valid user. The holding library immediately re-
ceives the electronic request information. There the staff locates the item, checks
it out to the requester in his or her home system, and places the item in a pouch
for the courier to pick up. Essentially this is a self-service ILL process with a
twenty-four- to thirty-six-hour turnaround time. Given the system&rsquo;s perfor-
mance to date, many of the traditional issues about local self-sufficiency are no
longer major factors. Perhaps by the time the next edition of this book is pub-
lished LINK+ libraries will have started some true cooperative collection devel-
opment activities.
</p>
<p>Tom Ballard published a provocative article in 1982 titled &ldquo;Public Library
Networking: Neat, Plausible, Wrong.&rdquo;14 He raised a number of points regarding
the primary service population, making a strong case, with data supporting his
arguments, that for public libraries and others in a multi-type library system, the
idea of cooperative collection development with an eye toward resource sharing
(ILL, generally) is fine, but it does not work. Drawing on data from a number of
systems across the United States, Ballard showed that interlibrary lending ac-
counts for very little of the total circulation, almost always representing less than
2 percent of the total. He cited studies indicating that people tend to select from
what is available at the time they come in, even if it is a second or third choice,
rather than seek and wait for the desired material. It would be interesting to see
what the results would be if such a study were done today, when many more li-
braries have their holdings readily available online. Again, by the time the next
edition of this book comes out we may have some interesting data on these is-
sues, as four large public library systems have joined the academic libraries that
made up LINK+&rsquo;s original membership.
</p>
<p>Although Ballard emphasized public libraries and provided examples relat-
ing to them, his statements hold some truth for anyone who works in a school
media center or an academic library serving undergraduates. Undoubtedly, part
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of the explanation for low use is that many people are not aware of the possibility
of getting needed items somewhere else, so more active marketing by the library
may be necessary. A more important factor is that people tend to wait until the
last minute to seek out needed information and cannot wait even a few days to
get a specific item. Perhaps a third factor is that most people do not really need or
want the material enough to pay the price for its delivery. If it is immediately
available (LMU is finding that twenty-four-hour availability is acceptable), fine;
if not, forget it. These considerations make a strong case for maintaining a
greater degree of local self-sufficiency.
</p>
<p>Another form of consortial efforts in an electronic world is group purchas-
ing of electronic databases, products, and services. Although these are rarely true
shared purchases, libraries are finding that they can sometimes achieve some
cash savings by negotiating a group rate on a product. Many of the regional net-
works discussed previously are entering into this arena as a means of gaining ad-
ditional income. A library that belongs to several cooperative groups may have
to sort out its &ldquo;best price&rdquo; from three or four possibilities, including what it
would cost going alone. Pricing of electronic databases, as discussed in Chapter
11, can be very confusing and the licenses even more bewildering.
</p>
<p>Acquiring Web-based databases alone is more complex than acquiring
other formats, especially if there is a full-text component to the product. There
are technical issues to address: a possible trial of the product just for the library
staff or staff and end-users, IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to supply for those
being given access, if and how to provide remote access, the means of control-
ling access if that is required, and so forth. There are issues of how the library
will provide access; for example, if the product has full-text from journals, will
there be links to the individual journal titles in the OPAC in addition to the links
provided in the database? Additional linking means additional work for the cata-
loging department, which may well be stretched close to its limit.
</p>
<p>When the acquisition of an electronic resource is made through one or more
consortia the complexity increases. There is a need to carefully calculate the cost
of the product under each option. Just looking at the &ldquo;bottom line&rdquo; figure is not
adequate. Pricing of electronic information services and products is unpredict-
able at best. There are no standards at present, so each group negotiating with a
vendor may end up with very different prices for what may at first appear to be
the same product, at least based on the product&rsquo;s name. Because the product is
electronic, the vendor has great latitude in packaging it. Vendors can and do add
one feature, drop another, or provide this or that &ldquo;extra&rdquo; for no cost. Thus there
may be two or three possible packages to examine to determine which one is ap-
propriate and affordable. Clearly this becomes a coordination issue within the
library. It is also a coordination issue for the consortia involved, both individu-
ally and as a group. Very often the price offered is based on how many libraries
sign up for a given package. If fewer are interested, the price always increases
per library; if more decide something is interesting, the price may go down.
</p>
<p>Based on several years of firsthand experience as &ldquo;president/chair&rdquo; of a
large California consortium, Edward Evans can say that this is probably the most
</p>
<p>82 4&mdash;Cooperation/Consortia and Technical Services</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>difficult aspect of group purchasing. It is rather like the concept of which came
first, the chicken or the egg. Libraries say, &ldquo;We are interested in knowing what
the price will be and what we&rsquo;ll get for that price.&rdquo; Vendors say, &ldquo;That will de-
pend on how many libraries actually sign up. So we cannot really give a solid
cost figure at this time.&rdquo; Eventually one is able to work out something resem-
bling the final price; however, when there is more than one group purchase
option on the table, the individual library has to be certain that the offers are in
fact identical. This issue is explored further in Chapter 11.
</p>
<p>Recently, yet another issue for group purchasing or pricing and collections
has emerged: the e-book. E-books are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11;
here, we address only the cooperative issues. The problem is really twofold.
When a consortium purchases a set of e-books for the group, who actually
&ldquo;owns&rdquo; the titles? Does each library own some small percentage, or does the
consortium own them, even if there is no physical location for the consortium?
The question of ownership would not matter, and does not seem to matter to
member libraries, but it does matter to organizations such as OCLC. These orga-
nizations assert that member libraries have a contractual obligation to add their
holdings information for such titles as if the title belonged to each library. This
would be a non-issue if it were not for cost considerations. There is a charge for
adding holdings data to the OCLC database. Although the charge is not that
much for single titles (U.S. $.28 in 2001), when several thousand titles are in-
volved as well as a large number of libraries, the amount becomes significant.
There is also a question of the increased workload for the cataloging department.
At the time we prepared this text, Edward Evans and the LINK consortium were
attempting to resolve these issues with OCLC. The consortium members were
disinclined to pay the fee individually; their position was that none of them
owned the material. OCLC offered a single consortium load cost plus a fee for
each library taking part in the purchase, including a fee for libraries that were not
OCLC members. The matter has not yet been resolved.
</p>
<p>Without question, technology offers more opportunities than barriers to co-
operation. The major concern is what the ultimate costs will be. Adjustments to
changing needs in a network of more than two members become complex. It is
much easier to respond to changing local needs when one does not have to worry
about the impact the adjustments will have on other libraries. Of course, any pro-
posed change may require modification of the original agreement. Although
most changes would be minor, each requires discussion with other member li-
braries and may have unexpected impacts on workloads.

<p>The Electronic World and Cooperation Today 83</p>
<p/>

<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>Cooperation has a very long history in libraries, and technical services have
led the way in many respects. It is difficult to imagine what librarianship would
be like if cataloging had not so quickly embraced computers and then the idea of
cooperative networking and work sharing. End-user needs and desires for
ever-greater access to information materials were an underlying driving force in
this movement.
</p>
<p>The electronic world is bringing added pressure for increased cooperative
activities that often have unexpected consequences for technical service units.
What the future holds is impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy; how-
ever, it is likely to be filled with change and challenges.

</p>
<p>The acquisitions department&rsquo;s contribution to the process of providing ser-
vice to end-users consists primarily of handling business matters of ordering and
receiving the materials selected for inclusion in the collection. (Note: Not all
items added to the collection are the result of purchases; some are gifts or ex-
changes.) The department is usually responsible for handling all such materials.
Occasionally the department is also responsible for bindery preparation work.
</p>
<p>Because of the standardized nature of much of acquisitions work, there is
little need for more than one or two librarians in the department. Most of the
work requires knowledge of bibliographic tools and searching skills. Support
staff does a large portion of the work in this department because very little of it
requires graduate-level education. In some libraries, the unit does not have even
one librarian staff member.
</p>
<p>Library acquisitions work covers the procedures used in buying or other-
wise acquiring materials for the collection: books, serials, audiovisual materials,
and other items. Acquiring office supplies and library equipment such as com-
puters, desks, or book trucks is seldom part of the acquisitions department&rsquo;s duties.
Most acquisitions work involves a high degree of repetition and lends itself to the
development of a series of standard routines. More and more, libraries are re-
ceiving funding to support the development and operation of various automated
routines, thus reducing the amount of tedious work.

</p>
<p>A common misconception of individuals who do not work in a library is
that acquisitions units determine what materials are in the library&rsquo;s collections.
Decisions regarding what to add to a collection are rarely made in this unit. The
usual practice is that some other group (usually the collection development staff)
makes such decisions and passes the &ldquo;request&rdquo; on to the acquisition staff, who at-
tempt to secure the item.

<p>A library&rsquo;s basic objective is to serve the information needs of its end-users.
The purpose of collection development is to select materials that serve the infor-
mation, educational, and/or recreational needs of its primary service community.
However, broad objectives such as these are difficult to interpret because one
person&rsquo;s recreation may be another&rsquo;s education.
</p>
<p>Each type of library&mdash;academic, public, school, or special&mdash;has a set of
specific objectives for its service programs that support the community&rsquo;s activi-
ties. Selection officers must know the community and its needs. Thus, they
spend time getting to know the community or institution they serve and learning
what materials are available to satisfy a given need. Because few libraries have
adequate funds to buy all the materials needed, selection officers also decide
which needs and materials will receive the highest priority.
</p>
<p>Selection policies help reduce some of the problems of making such deci-
sions. In all but the smallest libraries, several individuals normally share the re-
sponsibility for selecting materials. Naturally, the involvement of several people
in the selection process increases the need for coordination and understanding of
selection procedures. Policies usually include all of the following:
</p>
<p>1. A statement regarding who has the authority to select materials. Often
the director has this authority, but delegates it to staff members. In
such cases, this must be clearly stated.
</p>
<p>2. A statement concerning who has the responsibility for selecting materials.
</p>
<p>3. A statement of the library&rsquo;s goals and objectives for its collections.
</p>
<p>4. A list of the criteria for selecting materials.
</p>
<p>5. A list of review sources used in selecting materials.
</p>
<p>6. An outline of the procedures for handling problems (complaints
about having or not having certain items).
</p>
<p>7. Guidelines for allocating available funds for the collections.
</p>
<p>�����
�&amp;�����(&amp;���#���
)
</p>
<p>Written policies or program guidelines must be specific, but not so detailed
that selection officers cannot effectively handle changing circumstances. More
often than not, library selection officers are librarians. However, in some situa-
tions, such as school and public libraries, committees are the favored method of
making selection decisions. Frequently, in small- and medium-sized academic
libraries, teaching faculty are responsible for selecting materials.
</p>
<p>Public Library Selection
</p>
<p>Public libraries seldom encounter a problem about selection responsibility:
Librarians have the authority and responsibility for this work. If only one library
building serves a community, few problems of coordination arise that require
</p>
<p>92 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>any length of time to resolve. Often in such situations, one librarian has the re-
sponsibility for a specific area of the collection: children&rsquo;s books, reference
books, fiction, nonfiction, and so forth.
</p>
<p>When the library grows, and branches or bookmobiles become part of the
system, problems in coordinating selection increase. It is at this point that selec-
tion committees come into existence. Selection committees usually consist of
two or three people from the main library and the head of each branch or book-
mobile. In large systems (ten or more branches), the committee becomes repre-
sentational of the branch units. Normally some type of rotating committee
assignment ensures that all branches eventually have a voice in the process. A
primary purpose of committee work is to coordinate orders for multiple copies of
a single item. Submitting a single order for ten copies rather than ten orders for
one copy each saves acquisitions staff time. Multiple-copy orders frequently
qualify for a higher discount from the supplier and thus help stretch limited ac-
quisitions budgets.
</p>
<p>School and Academic Library Selection
</p>
<p>School and academic libraries share a dilemma in the selection process: To
what extent should teaching faculty share responsibility for collection develop-
ment? In an elementary and a secondary school situation, frequently there is a
districtwide committee that functions as a general selection body. A committee
of librarians and teachers creates lists of recommended items from which indi-
vidual schools make their selections. The purpose of the list is to facilitate order-
ing multiple titles at the same time, so that the district&rsquo;s acquisitions unit can save
the time and effort of ordering single copies several times.
</p>
<p>Academic libraries cannot handle the problem so easily. In small institu-
tions or institutions with limited acquisitions budgets, each teaching depart-
ment wants its subject area adequately covered. That fact usually means that
each department receives an allocation, a portion of the total acquisitions bud-
get, which it may then spend on materials of interest. Whenever a library allo-
cates funds to departments, to branch libraries (public or academic), or to
divisions within a library, the work of the acquisitions department becomes
more complex. In an academic departmental fund allocation situation, depart-
ments usually designate one faculty member as the library liaison person.
However, if there are twenty departments on the campus, the acquisitions de-
partment could be dealing with at least twenty selectors, each of whom has his
or her own idiosyncrasies.
</p>
<p>If an academic library has enough money to honor almost any request for
current materials, then responsibility for collection development often resides
in the library. Often public service librarians take on the selection duties as
well as reviewing faculty requests. A major disadvantage is that librarians usu-
ally lack the subject expertise of the faculty members. Most of the major re-
search libraries employ full-time subject specialists who do the collection
development work.
</p>
<p>Selection Responsibility 93</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Special Library Selection
</p>
<p>Defining collection development goals is easier for special libraries than
for any other kind of library. Most special libraries serve a clearly defined set of
needs, such as the research and development needs of a business or industry. A
special library may serve as the repository for rare books or may collect all avail-
able items on some specific topic or geographical area. This does not mean that
the work is simple, but clearly defined goals do limit the range of problems. In a
non-business, non-industrial special library, the librarian(s) usually has full re-
sponsibility for developing the collection. Industrial and business librarians usu-
ally share selection duties with the group of individuals served. In some cases, all
selections are the result of user requests.
</p>
<p>Approval of Selections
</p>
<p>If selection responsibility lies with individuals not on the library staff, the
requests usually require the approval of someone with final budget responsibil-
ity. For example, in an academic situation, any faculty member may request an
item, but the departmental library liaison, who supervises the department&rsquo;s li-
brary expenditures, must approve the request. Most request forms provide
space for the required signature. When sorting book request forms, the acquisi-
tions staff must check for the required approval. This is very important because
money will be drawn from various allocated funds on the basis of the approv-
ing signature.
</p>
<p>Acquisitions departments normally return forms lacking the requisite sig-
nature. The entire matter of approval signatures and departmental unit allocation
of funds creates many challenges and makes public relations complicated for the
acquisitions department. Therefore, everybody in the department&mdash;librarians,
support staff, and part-time help&mdash;should be aware of the difficulties and do all
they can to keep problems to a minimum.
</p>
<p>Other Sources of Requests
</p>
<p>Although libraries assign collection development responsibility to just a
few individuals, most libraries accept suggestions for additions to the collection
from anyone. These requests usually take longer to process, however, because
they must fit into the overall collection plan, and naturally there must be money
enough to buy the items. In most cases, the individual responsible for the subject
area within which the suggestion falls must give final approval to buy the item.
</p>
<p>Because the requests come from so many different sources, the individuals
filling out the request (or order) cards are often unaware of all the information the
acquisition unit needs to quickly order the desired item. Staff members should
view all the information on the request cards with a certain amount of skepti-
cism. In time, though, one learns which individuals take the time to supply accu-
rate information.
</p>
<p>94 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This discussion only summarizes how various types of libraries handle se-
lection and collection development work. Each library has its unique way of han-
dling the process. All staff assigned to the acquisitions unit should be aware of
how the selection process operates in their library.
</p>
<p>Departmental Functions
</p>
<p>Collection development and acquisitions have always been closely coordi-
nated, if not integrated, in libraries and information centers with successful pro-
grams. In today&rsquo;s increasingly electronic environment, that coordination is vital.
Joyce Ogburn once noted that managing an acquisitions program calls for a spe-
cial set of skills and activities: assessment, prediction, control, choice, valida-
tion, and quantification. Libraries
</p>
<p>assess the risk and feasibility of acquisition, the availability of
the resources, and the chances of success, control the system
and methods needed, the choice of the source, the supporting
services, and the resources themselves; and quantify the re-
sources, work, and costs involved to conduct the business of
acquisitions and measures of success.1
</p>
<p>These skills and activities are a constant, but today libraries may need to
draw upon the expertise of a number of staff members to acquire the desired elec-
tronic resources. We fully agree with Ron Ray&rsquo;s comment that, &ldquo;Library admin-
istrators cannot afford to leave acquisitions expertise out of their considerations
as libraries navigate into new technology environments and unconventional pat-
terns of information distribution. But neither should they feel constrained to con-
tinue organizing acquisitions expertise as it historically developed in libraries.&rdquo;2
</p>
<p>To be fully effective, selection and acquisitions personnel must have a
close, cooperative work relationship. Poor coordination will result in wasted ef-
fort, slow response time, and high unit costs. Achieving coordination requires
that all parties understand the work processes, problems, and value of each
other&rsquo;s work. Beyond the obvious purpose of supporting overall library objec-
tives, the acquisitions department has both library-wide goals and departmental
goals. Library-wide goals can be grouped into five broad areas of purpose:
</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing a knowledge of the book, media, and electronic re-
sources trade;
</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the selection and collection development process;
</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in processing requests for items to be added to the collection;
</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in monitoring the expenditure of collection development funds;
and
</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in maintaining all of the required records, and produce reports re-
garding the expenditure of funds.
</p>
<p>Selection Responsibility 95</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>By disseminating materials from the various information producers and
vendors, the acquisitions department aids in the selection process, even if there is
duplication. (Most information producers are uncertain who in the library makes
purchasing decisions. With electronic materials, the process is generally more
complex, with two or more persons involved in the decision making. Thus, it is
not surprising that producers buy a number of mailing lists to use when promot-
ing a new or revised product, resulting in several copies of the promotional liter-
ature being received. However, never assume that the item in hand is a duplicate
unless you are the only person to decide on the item in question.)
</p>
<p>Traditionally, acquisitions departments have maintained collections of
publishers&rsquo; catalogs, prepublication announcements, and vendors&rsquo; catalogs. It is
reasonable to expect to have a location where such items are kept. Such a loca-
tion, when properly maintained, can help assure that selectors have the opportu-
nity to review all the appropriate items regardless of whose name appeared on
the mailing label. Acquisitions units also collect information regarding changes
in publishing schedules, new publishers, and new services. Many departments
serve as clearinghouses for this type of information for the entire library. Indeed,
in larger libraries, the department sometimes operates a limited selective dissem-
ination of information (SDI) system by routing information to selectors based on
each individual&rsquo;s subject or area of responsibility. Despite the changing environ-
ment, there is no particular reason to change the location of such activities unless
there is a major reorganization, and even then the activities ought to be retained
in some form somewhere.
</p>
<p>Processing requests for materials involves several activities to ensure that
the library acquires the needed items as quickly and inexpensively as possible.
Libraries would waste time and money if they simply forwarded requests to the
appropriate publisher or vendor. Inaccurate information, duplicate requests, un-
available material, and similar problems would generate unacceptable costs for
both the library and the supplier (and would probably cause considerable ill
will). Each acquisitions department develops its own set of procedures to reduce
such problems. Although there are hundreds of variations, the basic process is
the same: preorder searching, ordering, receiving, fiscal managing, and record
keeping.
</p>
<p>Acquisitions departments also have internal goals. Four common goals are:
</p>
<p>1. To acquire materials as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>2. To maintain a high level of accuracy in all work procedures.
</p>
<p>3. To keep work processes simple to achieve the lowest possible unit
cost.
</p>
<p>4. To develop close, friendly working relationships with other library
units and with vendors.
</p>
<p>Internal goals are important to the achievement of the broader, library-wide
goals, because all of the department&rsquo;s decisions regarding internal goals will
have some impact on other operating units in the library.
</p>
<p>96 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Speed is a significant factor in meeting user demands and determining their
satisfaction. An acquisitions system that requires three or four months to secure
items available in local bookstores will create a serious public relations problem.
A system that is very fast but has a high error rate will increase operating costs
and will waste time and energy of both departmental staff and suppliers. Studies
have shown that, in many medium-sized and large libraries, the costs of acquir-
ing and processing an item are equal to or greater than the price of the item. By
keeping procedures simple and by periodically reviewing workflow, the depart-
ment can help the library provide better service. Speed, accuracy, and thrift
should be the watchwords of acquisitions departments. Certainly online order-
ing, electronic invoicing, and credit card payments greatly enhance the speed
with which the department can handle much of the traditional paperwork. What
has not changed much is the speed with which items actually arrive. The label
&ldquo;snail mail&rdquo; is still all too often appropriate for the shipping speed, unless one is
willing to pay a premium price for faster service.
</p>
<p>�
�**��%
</p>
<p>The rapidly changing electronic environment also has an impact on staff.
New technologies and applications put pressure on the staff to quickly learn new
skills because the workload seldom will decrease and there is a need to maintain
a steady flow of materials into the library. Acquisitions is but the first step in the
technical services process of making the materials ready for the users. Keeping a
flow of materials as even as possible allows other units, such as cataloging, to
plan their work more effectively.
</p>
<p>One popular label for the technology pressure on staff is &ldquo;technostress.&rdquo;
Technology pressures exist for all the library staff, not just in acquisitions. Sally
Kalin and Katie Clark have suggested that, &ldquo;The rapid change of technology
necessitates a different approach to training. . . . Staff also have to make a com-
mitment to learn new skills. Training must become an integral part of their work
life, not an adjunct.&rdquo;3 Given the need for training as well as time to become rea-
sonably comfortable in using the new skill(s), and that such activities become in-
tegral to daily work activities, there is a need to rethink duties. Many of the new
technologies and applications make the process of acquisitions less paper-based
and in some ways more efficient. Funding sources are more willing to spend
money on technology than they are to commit resources to additional positions.
What this means is that the library must not just move the traditional paper-based
methods over to a computer system. Staff must rethink activities and duties,
which, more often than not, leads to still more change for them to handle. In addi-
tion, libraries must also factor in time for the staff to receive training and develop
new skills. This is a challenge for all concerned.
</p>
<p>Efficient staffing involves using four classes of employees: professionals,
paraprofessionals, other support staff, and part-time help. Persons in each cate-
gory supply certain skills and knowledge required for the optimum operation of
the department.
</p>
<p>Librarians provide in-depth knowledge of library operations and the infor-
mation trade, in all its various guises. They set departmental objectives and
</p>
<p>Staffing 97</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>goals, prepare operating plans, develop policies, and supervise departmental op-
erations. They also carry out tasks requiring special skills or knowledge, such as
negotiating license agreements, monitoring/forecasting possible price increases
for budget requests, and working with vendors to secure discounts. If the acquisi-
tions department does not have any selection responsibility (and few do), only
the largest departments need to have many professionals. With properly planned
procedures, support staff can handle most of the department&rsquo;s activities.
</p>
<p>Several surveys indicate that this staffing pattern is typical of U.S. libraries.
One of the more comprehensive studies was done by Karen Schmidt. Her data
showed that support staff perform at least 75 percent of each of the major acqui-
sitions activities (preorder searching, ordering, claiming, and receiving).4 An-
other study by James Coffey reviewed personnel costs of library acquisitions.
His message was that there is a need to carefully consider staffing patterns when
trying to control the cost of acquisitions work.5 Similar studies done today would
have much the same results despite the changes brought about by technology.
</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of the Schmidt article is her data showing the continu-
ing division of acquisitions and serials work in the majority of the responding
libraries.6 (We did not identify any similar later study, but we believe that more
merged units exist today.) A somewhat dated, but still sound, review of technical
service reorganization efforts, including merging acquisitions and serials depart-
ments, is an article by Joni Gomez and Jeanne Harrell.7 As noted in Chapter 3,
there is a trend to merge the departments, as Loyola Marymount University did,
when a library installs an integrated automation system. After eleven years, we
can say with confidence that the merger at LMU works well. (A reflection of the
ease of securing funds for collections and technology but not people is found in
the LMU acquisitions/serials department. In the time since the merger, collec-
tion development funds went from just under $400,000 to $2.4 million, and the
library went through two generations of automation systems, all without the ben-
efit of a single new staff member.)
</p>
<p>As noted previously, few acquisitions departments have any selection re-
sponsibility. Most libraries divide selection responsibility among all librarians
and, in some instances, users. Many large public and research libraries employ
full-time subject specialists for collection development work. Even in such li-
braries, the individuals involved in the process must cover broad subject areas or
select materials published in many countries. Beyond those basic selection func-
tions, excluding acquisitions, selectors perform ongoing liaison activities with
their primary user groups:
</p>
<p>&bull; Review gift and exchange materials;
</p>
<p>&bull; Review acquisition programs, such as approval plans and standing orders;
</p>
<p>&bull; Take part in fund allocation discussions;
</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct various user and circulation studies;
</p>
<p>&bull; Be involved in deselection decisions;
</p>
<p>&bull; Plan and implement collection evaluation studies; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify needed retrospective materials.

<p>Adding these duties to other full-time activities, as is typical in most librar-
ies, results in not all the duties being performed as often as everyone wishes.
Some activities receive little attention; deselection and user studies are two areas
commonly given less time and effort than is desirable. Figure 5.1 illustrates the
basic functions of an acquisitions unit.

<p>A few comments about outsourcing are applicable in the acquisitions con-
text. If one only read the 1998/1999 literature about library outsourcing, one
might think this was a radical departure for libraries. To the degree that it is being
done to reduce staff (&ldquo;downsizing&rdquo; in current management jargon), it is rela-
tively new. However, libraries have outsourced a variety of activities for many
years&mdash;using jobbers/vendors to consolidate order placement for books and/or
serials, for example. When used for what Arnold Hirshon and Barbara Winters
labeled &ldquo;strategic reasons,&rdquo;8 that is, to supplement existing staff efforts or to han-
dle ever-increasing workloads without benefit of additional staff, outsourcing
can be a useful tool in the acquisitions department.
</p>

</p>
<p>Acquisitions departments, whether merged with serials or not, acquire ma-
terials using several methods, each involving different processing. Essentially
there are seven standard methods of acquisition: firm order, standing order,
approval plans, blanket order subscriptions (for serials departments), leases (in-
creasing in use), gifts, and exchange programs. Each of the order types is dis-
cussed in Chapter 8.
</p>
<p>A library&rsquo;s collection exists to achieve certain objectives: education, infor-
mation, aesthetic appreciation, recreation, and research. Each objective requires
a different mix of formats. Aesthetic appreciation often requires recorded music,
dramatic readings, and visual and graphic materials of various types. Research
objectives often require acquiring report literature, conference papers, and pro-
ceedings. The acquisition of these materials requires in-depth knowledge about
the materials and suitable sources of supply.
</p>
<p>Printed Materials
</p>
<p>Books and printed materials represent the bulk of library purchases. Pub-
lishers in the United States produce more than 30,000 new titles each year and
more than 10,000 new editions. Even if they devoted all their acquisitions money
to buying books, most libraries could (and would want to) buy only a fraction of
the total output. Some larger jobbers dealing only in English-language books
have well over 100,000 titles available. Out-of-print materials range from 20
million to 50 million titles just for Western Europe and North America. Any of
these titles could be of interest to a library.
</p>
<p>In addition to books, thousands of periodical and serial titles appear every
year. Government documents&mdash;national, state, local, and international&mdash;are an-
other category of printed material acquired by libraries of all sizes (see Chapter
12). There are also scholarly publications, dissertations, theses, and publications
of learned societies. Atlases, sheet maps (topographic maps; county highway
maps; maps of national parks, forests, and recreation areas; aviation charts; and
navigational charts), folded maps (highway maps), raised relief maps, and
globes are staples in many library collections.
</p>
<p>100 5&mdash;Acquisitions&mdash;Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Printed music is still another category of material that should be familiar to
acquisitions department personnel. Piano-vocal scores, miniature scores, and
monumental sets are in larger library collections. Pamphlets and ephemera of all
types (broadsides, house organs, personal papers, and documents) are also part
of material the acquisitions department orders and receives. Chapters 6 and 10
provide a discussion of publishers and producers of print and other formats as
well as of print-based journals.
</p>
<p>Nonbook Materials
</p>
<p>Microfilm and microfiche are two different aspects of the nonbook medium
called microforms: films that carry copies of printed matter. Many out-of-print
books are now available only in microform because the cost of reprinting is very
high for the small number of copies that might sell. Making a microfilm or elec-
tronic copy and reproducing it is much less expensive. Also, it is possible to
reproduce all or parts of a book on demand from a master negative at a reason-
able price. To order microforms, the selector must know something about the
proposed use of the material and what methods of reproduction are available.
This is especially true when the purpose is to have a preservation copy. Some-
times, when a microform is not satisfactory, a hard copy is reproduced in the
same size as the original. The order department must be aware of such factors
before placing the order.
</p>
<p>Other popular nonbook materials are audiotapes, CD recordings, video-
cassettes, and DVDs. Most libraries (medium-sized or larger) have at least a
small audio collection. Public and school libraries tend to have larger nonbook
collections than do academic libraries. Videocassettes and DVDs are increas-
ingly becoming part of the circulating collection. Some libraries, generally pub-
lic libraries, have been circulating software packages for home computers.
Libraries face a number of challenges in acquiring these items, but many of the
steps used to order a book apply to these other media as well. (See Chapter 13 for
more information about media formats.)
</p>
<p>Electronic Resources
</p>
<p>Electronic resources also come in a variety of forms: CDs, tape loads, Web
resources, and Web-based products. Many of the products are variations of
print-based materials such as encyclopedias, indexes, and abstracting services.
Others are the full text of print-based publications such as books and journals.
Still others are original publications in an electronic format. More and more
products are appearing that are multimedia in character, including text, sound,
and graphics. Each variation has some special features that must be taken into ac-
count at the time of acquisition. There are also special legal issues that do not
arise with print-based items. These points are explored in Chapter 11.

<p>Knowing something about why the library is acquiring the materials helps
the acquisitions staff understand the whys and wherefores of the department&rsquo;s
procedures and responsibilities. Also, knowing something about the operations
of the companies from whom they buy the materials helps in maintaining good
library-vendor relations. It is important that all staff in the department have op-
portunities to expand and update their knowledge about these topics to have the
department operate as effectively as possible.

</p>
<p>Collections in today&rsquo;s libraries and information centers contain a wide vari-
ety of information formats. In the not too distant past, the vast majority of the
collections were print-based. Acquisitions departments probably could function
without knowing very much about the producers of the product they purchase.
However, the departments will be both more effective and efficient when the
staff understands something about the production side of the information cycle:
creation, production, distribution, access/storage, and usage. (The distribution
process is covered in Chapter 7. Issues of access are covered in Chapter 11. The
topics of creation and usage are beyond the scope of this book.) Understanding
the factors that enter into the costs and discounts of the products a library pur-
chases assists in the business activities it undertakes (better vendor relations) as
well as end-user interaction (better public relations).
</p>
<p>Production of information materials underwent a series of changes during
the last half of the twentieth century, and the pace of change is accelerating.
Print-based publishing began to change in the 1950s when most publishing firms
were private partnerships. Company control was in the hands of only one family
(or perhaps two or three families) throughout a firm&rsquo;s history. Family pride and a
feeling of personal involvement with each title published was a characteristic of
such companies. Although they did not set out deliberately to lose money, many
such firms passed up manuscripts they knew would make a profit simply because
they felt that the material did not merit carrying their company&rsquo;s name.
</p>
<p>Expanding educational programs in the post&ndash;World War II era translated
into an explosive growth in demand for print materials. (See Chapter 1.) Private
publishing firms lacked the capital to expand fast enough to meet the growing
market. One method of securing the necessary money was to &ldquo;go public,&rdquo; that is,
to sell company stock. Selling stock changes the nature of a firm&rsquo;s business be-
cause the firm takes on a commitment to attempt to return the maximum profit to
the investor. As a result, the primary concern for many firms became profit rather
than maximum quality.
</p>

<p>�</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As publishing grew more and more profitable, larger nonpublishing busi-
nesses decided that the field was a worthwhile investment arena. Major elec-
tronic, computer, and other communication media companies bought publishing
firms; in a sense this was the start of the blending of print and nonbook produc-
tion activities within a single firm. Some companies of this type controlled seven
or eight publishing firms, each firm operating under its old name but actually
controlled by nonpublishing interests. If individual investors caused a change in
the nature of publishing, it is not difficult to imagine the long-term effects of cor-
porate investment. Profitability and corporate well-being became the primary
factors in selecting materials for publication.
</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1980s, the movement began toward electronic publishing.
&ldquo;Electronic publishing&rdquo; has taken on several meanings; however, initially it
meant producing a publication solely in a digital format and frequently selling it
to individual users on demand. Today the term has taken on broader and less pre-
cise meanings, ranging from the original concept to producing some combina-
tion of print and digital material.
</p>
<p>In the past, information producers could be categorized by their products:
(1) those who produced printed matter (books, periodicals, newspapers, and the
like), and (2) those who produced nonbook materials. Seldom did a producer
work in both areas. Today the situation is different. Although some companies
are solely devoted to the production of print or audiovisual materials, most trade
book publishers also have one or more electronic and audiovisual lines. Univer-
sity presses and other scholarly publishers are also moving into electronic pub-
lishing, including the &ldquo;publication&rdquo; of materials solely on CDs or other digital
formats. One such example is the University of North Carolina Press&rsquo;s Exca-
vating Occaneechi Town (R. P. S. Davis, P. C. Livingood, H. T. Ward, and V. P.
Steponaitis. University of North Carolina Press, 1998).
</p>
<p>Some time in the future we may see the &ldquo;paperless&rdquo; world often predicted
in both the popular and scholarly press. (F. W. Lancaster has written extensively
about this topic; see Libraries and Librarians in an Age of Electronics.1) Despite
such predictions, printed materials are still very much with us and probably will
be for some time. Print materials still make up the largest percentage of items
available through most libraries and information centers.
</p>
<p>A sense of the staying power of print is found in sources such as Books in
Print (BIP). The 1988 edition of BIP listed 781,292 titles; by 1998 that number
had more than doubled to over 1.6 million. (Note: These numbers are based on
unique ISBNs; titles are double counted if there were both hardcover and paper
editions in print. Some popular titles might even be triple counted, if there were
also an audio edition available.) Electronic products are being produced in in-
creasing numbers, but as of 2001 they had not noticeably slowed the production
of print materials.
</p>
<p>A major reason for the staying power of books is that paper copies still pro-
vide the least expensive means of distributing large quantities of timely informa-
tion to a large number of people. A long document (300 or more pages) can be
</p>
<p>108 6&mdash;Information Producers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>mounted on the Internet, and many people do so. Obviously any number of indi-
viduals can simultaneously read that document. However, very few individuals
using that material attempt to read it on the computer screen. Rather, they print
some portion (or the entire file) and read the material in a printed form. (Anyone
with experience in a reference department is well aware of the volume of printing
being done of electronic data, mostly relatively short files.) Also, some people
are uncomfortable with technology-based information sources. There is always
some question, with electronic files, about the integrity of the material: Is what
one sees on the screen what the author originally input? Finally, many people
still like to read in bed, on the subway, at the beach, and other places where tech-
nology-based systems are inconvenient, if not impossible, to use. (Try reading a
CRT screen in full sunlight at the beach.)
</p>
<p>Albert Greco has summed up the present day situation in U.S. publishing as
follows:
</p>
<p>Many industry analysts believe that publishing is in disarray,
dangerously weakened by steep returns, stark sales figures,
fickle and price sensitive customer base, the &ldquo;rise&rdquo; of chains
and superstores and price clubs and the concomitant &ldquo;decline&rdquo;
of independent book stores, a population more interested in
watching television than in reading books, paper-thin profit
margins, staggering technological challenges, and author ad-
vances that dumbfound even seasoned industry veterans. . . . Its
best days are indeed ahead, a fact that excites tens of thousands
of people every day about this wonderful, funny, and, at times,
hard business.2
</p>
<p>���
����("#������%!
</p>
<p>What is publishing? That question has been with us, at least in North Amer-
ica, for almost 300 years. Publishers and others have debated whether publish-
ing&rsquo;s purpose is cultural or commercial.
</p>
<p>In the abstract, and to some degree in the real world, &ldquo;The Book&rdquo; is a cul-
tural artifact as well as an essential means of recording and preserving the culture
of a society. Certainly libraries of all types have to a greater or lesser degree
some role to play in preserving and passing on their society&rsquo;s cultural values and
heritage. Thus, books have taken on a special aura of importance, some might
even say sacredness, that is very different than that of, say, clothes, cars, or cam-
eras. Discarding worn-out items like the latter may bring some scowls from a
few people, but there is widespread disapproval of doing the same with a book.
From early childhood one hears, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bend the pages,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wash your hands be-
fore using your books,&rdquo; &ldquo;Treat your books with respect,&rdquo; and being labeled a
&ldquo;book burner&rdquo; is something most people would consider an insult.
</p>
<p>What Is Publishing? 109</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>�&amp;��("#������%��&amp;�$�
</p>
<p>Publishers supply the capital and editorial assistance required to transform
an author&rsquo;s manuscript into a book and electronic product. (Two exceptions to
this are vanity and subsidy presses, discussed later in this section.) Generally,
publishers in Western countries perform six basic functions:
</p>
<p>1. Tap sources of materials (manuscripts).
</p>
<p>2. Raise and supply the capital to produce books or e-products.
</p>
<p>3. Aid in the development of the manuscript.
</p>
<p>4. Contract for the manufacturing (printing, binding, formatting) of the
materials for sale.
</p>
<p>5. Distribute the materials as well as promoting and advertising the titles.
</p>
<p>6. Maintain records of sales, contracts, and correspondence relating to
the production and sale of materials.
</p>
<p>A thumbnail sketch of the basic publishing development pattern is perti-
nent. This pattern seems to be worldwide, and it does have an impact on the ac-
quisitions process. In the history of publishing, there appear to be three stages of
development. These stages have occurred around the world as publishing has de-
veloped in a particular country.
</p>
<p>In stage one, the publishing, printing, and selling of the product were all
combined into one firm. The early giants of the &ldquo;industry&rdquo; in Europe acted as
publisher, printer, and retail bookseller. These publishers included Froben,
Schoffer, Manutius, and Caxton. When one examines North American publish-
ing history, the same pattern appears on the eastern seaboard, moving west with
the frontier; names like Franklin, Green, and Harris in the United States and
Gilmore &amp; Brown and Thomson in Canada fall into this period. Elsewhere in the
world, publishing exhibits a similar evolutionary pattern, which is largely a func-
tion of how societies organize economic, educational, and human resources. In
countries with limited resources, technical skills, and small markets, it is unfea-
sible, and in many cases impossible, to have specialty firms handling the several
functions required to produce books, journals, and today, electronic resources.
</p>
<p>From an acquisitions point of view, stage one development presents many
interesting challenges. Research libraries buy materials from around the world,
but countries with weak economies and low literacy rates seldom have anything
resembling a national bibliography or trade bibliography (mainstays in identify-
ing important titles). As if this were not enough of a challenge, most publishers
operating at this level produce a limited number of copies of each item. In many
cases, they take orders before going into production. When they do this, they
produce just a few more copies than the number ordered. Many acquisitions de-
partments have experienced the frustration of having an order returned with the
</p>
<p>110 6&mdash;Information Producers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>comment &ldquo;unavailable, only xxx copies printed.&rdquo; Some items are, in fact, out of
print on the date of publication; this frequently occurs in areas where publishing
is at the stage one level.
</p>
<p>In stage two, specialization begins, with firms emphasizing publishing or
printing. New firms, many with a single emphasis, appear. The factors creating
this situation relate to available economic, educational, and human resources.
Better education creates a greater market for books among both individual and
institutional buyers. The retail trade develops at the same time, because the read-
ing public exists countrywide and a single outlet in the country&rsquo;s major popula-
tion center is no longer adequate.
</p>
<p>Often, when bookstores begin to develop, a company will decide to create a
listing or publication through which publishers inform bookstores about new and
existing titles. Acquisitions librarians expend time and energy trying to track
down such systems in countries where the book trade is in stage two. The usual
procedure is to establish a good working relationship with a large bookstore,
with that shop functioning as a purchasing agent. This may entail signing an
agreement to spend a certain amount of money each year with the store, but it
normally results in much better coverage, and usually better service, than trying
to buy directly from the publishing houses.
</p>
<p>The third stage is the complete separation of the three basic functions, as
publishers discontinue printing activities. For example, John and James Harper
started as printers in 1817. Today, HarperCollins is one of the leading publishers
in the United States. It ceased printing years ago. When publishing reaches stage
three, all the trappings we see in contemporary U.S. publishing are evident: spe-
cialty publishers, literary agents, trade journals, sales personnel, jobbers and
wholesalers, and so forth. Normally, there is something resembling a national
bibliography as well as a trade bibliography, both of which are essential for col-
lection development work.
</p>
<p>A fourth stage&mdash;electronic publishing&mdash;is developing quickly. Some pub-
lishers offer information in two or more formats, for example, print and elec-
tronic, and others offer some information only in an electronic format.
Digitization is especially useful in the production process; submission of elec-
tronic manuscripts containing digitized images also speeds editorial work. The
implications of electronic publishing for the bottom line are clear to most pub-
lishers, as suggested by Gayle Feldman: &ldquo;Whether it be CD-ROM opportunities
for scholarly presses, document delivery revenue for journal publishers, or multi-
media packages for the reference crowd . . . the coffee breaks buzzed with con-
viction that publishers who ignore new technology do so at their peril.&rdquo;3 As the
next millennium begins, few publishers are risking being left behind in a
print-only world.

<p>The publication Book Industry Trends employs a ten-category system for
grouping the book publishing industry in the United States:
</p>
<p>Trade
</p>
<p>Mass market
</p>
<p>Book clubs
</p>
<p>Mail order (including e-mail)
</p>
<p>Religious
</p>
<p>Professional
</p>
<p>University presses
</p>
<p>El-Hi (elementary and high school textbooks)
</p>
<p>College textbook
</p>
<p>Publisher/distributor
</p>
<p>Because Book Industry Trends is primarily interested in economic and sta-
tistical data and publishers can and do have several &ldquo;lines,&rdquo; this grouping is
slightly different from the one used in this book. (Note: Publishers often have
several &ldquo;lines&rdquo; or divisions that handle a specific type of publishing such as trade
books, college textbooks, and mass-market paperbacks.) The following discus-
sion provides an overview of these and two additional types of publishing firms,
some of which mirror the categories used by Book Industry Trends, and some
more specific to the library world. Some are identified by different names.
</p>
<p>Trade publishers produce a wide range of titles, both fiction and nonfiction,
that have wide sales potential. HarperCollins; Alfred A. Knopf; Doubleday;
Macmillan; Little, Brown; Thames &amp; Hudson; Random House; and McClelland
&amp; Stewart are typical trade publishers. Many trade publishers have divisions that
produce specialty titles, such as children&rsquo;s, college textbooks, paperback, and
reference. Trade publishers have three markets: bookstores, libraries, and whole-
salers. To sell their products, publishers often send sales representatives to visit
buyers in businesses or institutions in each of the markets. Discounts for trade titles
tend to be higher than for many other types of publications.
</p>
<p>Specialty publishers restrict output to a few areas or subjects. Facts on File
is an example of a specialty publisher in the field of reference titles. Specialty
publishers&rsquo; audiences are smaller and more critical of the material than are trade
publishers&rsquo; audiences. The categories of specialty publishers include reference,
paperback, children&rsquo;s, microform, music, cartographic, and subject area. Dis-
counts tend to be low for titles in this category.
</p>
<p>Textbook publishers, especially those that target the primary and secondary
schools (El-Hi), occupy one of the highest risk areas of publishing. Most pub-
lishers in this area develop a line of textbooks for several grades, for example, a
</p>
<p>112 6&mdash;Information Producers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>social studies series. Preparation of such texts requires large amounts of time,
energy, and money. Printing costs are high because most school texts feature ex-
pensive color plates and other specialized presswork. Such projects require
large, up-front investments that must be recouped before a profit can be realized.
If enough school districts adopt a text, profits can be substantial, but failure to
secure adoption can mean tremendous loss. Larger textbook firms, such as Ginn
or Scott, Foresman &amp; Company, produce several series to help ensure a profit or
to cushion against loss. Given the extreme volatility of this venue, the question
remains, &ldquo;Why would a company take this risk?&rdquo; During the 1990s U.S. El-Hi
publishers faced increased pressure to change the content of their publications
from a variety of special interest groups.5 This pressure adds yet another element
of risk to textbook publishing. Discounts are rare for El-Hi titles, except in very
large quantities, and low for college-level materials.
</p>
<p>Subject specialty publishers share some of the characteristics of textbook
houses. Many have narrow markets that are easy to identify. Focusing marketing
efforts on a limited number of potential buyers allows specialty publishers to
achieve a reasonable return with less risk than a trade publisher takes on a nonfic-
tion title. Specialty houses exist for a variety of fields; examples include art (e.g.,
Harry N. Abrams), music (e.g., Schirmer), science (e.g., Academic Press), tech-
nical (e.g., American Technical Publishers), law (e.g., West Publishing), and
medical (e.g., W. B. Saunders). Many specialty books require expensive graphic
preparation or presswork. Such presswork increases production costs, which is
one of the reasons art, music, and science, medical, and technology (SMT) titles
are so costly. Another factor in their cost is their smaller market compared to the
market for a trade title. A smaller market means the publisher must recover pro-
duction costs from fewer books. Although the risk level is greater for specialty
publishing than for trade publishing, it is much lower than that for El-Hi publish-
ers. Discounts for such items are low to nonexistent.
</p>
<p>Vanity presses differ from other publishing houses in that they receive most
of their operating funds from the authors whose works they publish. An example
is Exposition Press. Vanity presses always show a profit and never lack material
to produce. They offer editing assistance for a fee, and they arrange to print as
many copies of the book as the author can afford. Distribution is the author&rsquo;s
chore. Although providing some of the same functions as other publishers, they
do not share the same risks. Many authors who use vanity presses donate copies
of their books to local libraries, but such items frequently arrive with no indica-
tion that they are gifts. Books arriving in the acquisitions department without
packing slips or invoices create extra work for the staff as they attempt to deter-
mine why the item arrived. By knowing vanity publishers, acquisitions depart-
ment staff can make their work easier.
</p>
<p>Private presses are not business operations in the sense that the owners do
not always expect to make money. Most private presses are an avocation rather
than a vocation for the owners. Examples are Henry Morris, Bird, and Poull
Press. In many instances, the owners do not sell their products but give them
away. Most private presses are owned by individuals who enjoy fine printing and
experimenting with type fonts and design. When an owner gives away the end
product (often produced on a hand press), only a few copies are printed. In the
</p>
<p>Types of Publishers 113</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>past, many developments in type and book design originated with private
presses. Some of the most beautiful examples of typographic and book design
originated at private presses. Large research libraries often attempt to secure
copies of items produced by private presses.
</p>
<p>Scholarly publishers, as part of a not-for-profit organization, receive subsi-
dies. Most are part of an academic institution (University of California Press),
museum (Museum of the American Indian Heye Foundation), research institu-
tion (Battelle Memorial Institute), or learned society (American Philosophical
Society). Scholars established these presses to produce scholarly books that
would not be acceptable to most for-profit publishers. Most scholarly books have
limited sales appeal. A commercial, or for-profit, publisher considering a schol-
arly manuscript has three choices: (1) publish it and try to sell it at a price to
ensure costs are recovered; (2) publish it, sell it at a price comparable to commer-
cial titles, and lose money; or (3) do not publish the item. Because of economic
factors and a need to disseminate scholarly information regardless of cost (that
is, even if it will lose money), the subsidized (by tax exemption, if nothing else),
not-for-profit press exists. As publishing costs have skyrocketed, it has been nec-
essary to fully subsidize some scholarly books, almost in the manner of a vanity
press.
</p>
<p>The role of the scholarly press in the economical and open dissemination of
knowledge is critical. Every country needs some form of this type of press. With-
out scholarly presses, important works with limited appeal do not get published.
Certainly there are times when a commercial house is willing to publish a book
that will not show a profit because the publisher thinks the book is important, but
relying on that type of willingness will, in the long run, mean that many impor-
tant works will never appear in print. Discounts for scholarly press titles are nor-
mally modest at best.
</p>
<p>Like their for-profit counterparts, scholarly presses are making ever-greater
use of electronic publishing techniques. Two good survey articles about how
electronics are changing scholarly publishing are William Arms&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scholarly
Publishing on the National Networks&rdquo;6 and Ann Okerson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Publishing Through
the Network: The 1990s Debutante.&rdquo;7 Although the networks hold promise, they
also hold the possibility of higher information costs. As Lisa Freeman notes:
</p>
<p>If profit rather than commitment to scholarly communication
becomes the primary goal of those controlling access to the
Internet, university presses would find themselves unable to af-
ford to publish the scholarly works that are the core of their ac-
tivities. Thus the public nature of the Internet must be carefully
guarded if we want to realize the true benefits of a democratic
networked environment: broad access to scholarly research and
information not driven by financial concerns. A diverse range
of independent, nonprofit publishers is critical to that goal.8
</p>
<p>Government presses are the world&rsquo;s largest publishers. The combined annual
output of government publications&mdash;international (UNESCO); national (U.S.
Government Printing Office and Canadian Government Publishing); and state,
</p>
<p>114 6&mdash;Information Producers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>provincial, regional, and local (Los Angeles or State of California)&mdash;dwarfs
commercial output. In the past, many people thought of government publications
as being characterized by poor physical quality or as uninteresting items that
governments gave away. Today, some government publications rival the best
offerings of commercial publishers and cost much less. (The government price
does not fully recover production costs, so the price can be lower.) Most govern-
ment publishing activity goes well beyond the printing of legislative hearings or
actions and occasional executive materials. Often national governments publish
essential and inexpensive (frequently free) materials on nutrition, farming,
building trades, travel, and many other topics. (See Chapter 12 for more detailed
information about government publications.)
</p>
<p>Paperback publishers produce two types of work: quality trade paperbacks
and mass-market paperbacks. A trade publisher may have a quality paperback
division or may issue the paperbound version of a book through the same divi-
sion that issued the hardcover edition. The publisher may publish original paper-
backs, that is, a first edition in paperback. Distribution of quality paperbacks is
the same as for hardcover books. Mass-market paperback publishers issue only
reprints, or publications that first appeared in hardcover. Their distribution dif-
fers from that of other books. Their low price is based, in part, on the concept of
mass sales. Therefore, they sell anywhere the publisher can get someone to han-
dle them. The paperback books on sale in train and bus stations, airline terminals,
corner stores, and kiosks are mass-market paperbacks. These books have a short
shelf life compared to hardcovers.
</p>
<p>Books with paper covers are not new. In some countries all books come out
with paper covers, and buyers must bind the books they wish to keep. The major
difference is that most people think of only the mass-market paperback as a
&ldquo;paperback.&rdquo; The emphasis on popular, previously published titles issued in new
and colorful covers and sold at a low price is apparent. Those are the elements of
the paperback revolution, not the paper cover or even the relatively compact
form. Nor has the paperback created a whole new group of readers, as some
over-enthusiastic writers claim. It has merely tapped an existing market for
low-cost, popular books.
</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, using a paper cover rather than a hard cover does
not reduce the unit cost of a book by any significant amount. Original paperbacks
incur the same costs, except for the cover material, as a hardcover title, which is
why their cost is so much higher than that of reprint paperbacks. The reason the
price of paperbacks is so much lower than hardcovers is that most first appeared
as hardcovers. The title already sold well in hardcover, or there would be no rea-
son to bring out a paper version, so the book probably has already shown a profit.
This means the publisher has already recovered almost all of the major produc-
tion costs, thus making it possible to reduce the price. In addition, releasing a
paperback version of a hardcover title allows the publisher to benefit from mar-
keting efforts expended on the hardcover version. Marketing efforts for the hard-
cover carry over to the paperback, which further reduces publishing costs.
Economies of scale, or high sales volume and low per-unit profits, also reduce
the price. Discounts for original titles in paperback are similar to those for hard-
backs, while mass-market discounts tend to be higher.
</p>
<p>Types of Publishers 115</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Small presses are important for some libraries. Small presses are thought of
as literary presses by some people, including librarians. Anyone reading the an-
nual &ldquo;Small Press Round-Up&rdquo; in Library Journal could reasonably reach the
same conclusion. The reality is that small presses are as diverse as the interna-
tional publishing conglomerates. Size is the only real difference; in functions and
interests small presses are no different than large trade publishers.
</p>
<p>Small Press Record of Books in Print (SPRBIP) annually lists between
15,000 and 17,000 titles from about 1,800 small publishers.9 Many of these
presses are one-person operations, a sideline from the publisher&rsquo;s home. Such
presses seldom publish more than four titles per year. The listings in SPRBIP
show the broad range of subject interests of small presses and that there are both
book and periodical presses in this category. Some people assume that the con-
tent of small-press publications is poor. This is incorrect, for small presses do not
produce, proportionally, any more poor quality titles than do the large publishers.
Often, it is only through the small press that one can find information on less
popular topics.
</p>
<p>Another factor that sets small presses apart from their larger counterparts is
economics. Large publishers have high costs and need substantial sales to re-
cover their costs, but small presses can produce a book for a limited market at a
reasonable cost and still expect some profit. Small presses also can produce
books more quickly than their larger counterparts.
</p>
<p>From an acquisitions point of view, small presses represent a challenge.
Tracking down new releases can present a variety of problems. Locating a cor-
rect current address is one common problem. Another is learning about the title
before it goes out of print. SPRBIP tries to provide current information. How-
ever, waiting for the annual SPRBIP may take too long, because small presses
frequently move about and their press runs are small, that is, only a limited quan-
tity of books are printed.
</p>
<p>Acquisitions departments interested in small presses have had some com-
mercial help. Quality Books of Oregon (a vendor that in the past was known
primarily as a source of remainder books) has become active in the distribution
of small press publications. Although it stocks books from only a small percent-
age of the presses listed in SPRBIP (about one-fifth), the fact that it does stock
the items is a major feature. Like other distributors it has a &ldquo;Web presence&rdquo;
(www.quality&ndash;books.com).
</p>
<p>Serial (newspaper and periodical) publishers are a different class of pub-
lisher. Usually, book publishers depend on persons outside their organization to
prepare the material that they publish. Newspaper and periodical publishers have
staff reporters or writers. Of course, there are exceptions to the exception. For in-
stance, some popular (and most scholarly) periodicals consist of articles written
by persons not employed by the organization that publishes the journal. In gen-
eral, in newspaper or periodical publishing, one finds the same range of activities
found in book publishing. In other words, there are commercial publishers of
popular materials, specialty publishers, children&rsquo;s publishers, scholarly or aca-
demic publishers, and government publishers. All subcategories share the char-
acteristics of their book publishing counterparts; some are divisions of book
publishing organizations. Chapters 10 and 11 cover serial publishers in more detail.

<p>Publisher/distributors are an important part of the publishing industry in
Canada. Because Canada&rsquo;s small population is stretched over a very large coun-
try, distribution costs are higher and production runs are lower than in the United
States. Many Canadian publishers, such as Thomas Allen and Fitzhenry &amp;
Whiteside, also function as distributors or agents of foreign publishers to supple-
ment their publishing activities. A list of Canadian publishers is found in Quill &amp;
Quire&rsquo;s Canadian Publishers Directory, published semi-annually.

</p>
<p>Publishing consists of five basic functions, which apply equally to print and
nonprint materials: administration, editorial work, production, marketing, and
fulfillment. A publisher must be successful in all five areas if the organization is
to survive for any length of time. Just because the organization is a nonprofit
does not mean it has any less need for success in each of these areas. Administra-
tion deals with ensuring that there is coordination among the functional depart-
ments, as well as making certain there are adequate funds available to cover the
costs of doing business.
</p>
<p>It is in the editorial area that publishers decide what to produce and when to
release it for sale. Acquisitions and managing editors discuss and review ideas
for books or articles. Publishers develop trade lists (a combination of prior publi-
cations, manuscripts in production, and titles under contract) that they hope will
achieve a profit while avoiding unnecessary competition with other publishers.
</p>
<p>Securing and reviewing manuscripts is a time-consuming activity for most
editors. An educated guess is that editors reject approximately nine-tenths of all
unsolicited manuscripts after the first examination. After the first complete read-
ing still more manuscripts are rejected. Even after a careful review by several
people, all of whom have favorable reactions, the editor may not accept the
manuscript. Three common reasons for nonselection are that (1) the title will not
fit into the new list, (2) the sales potential (market) is too low, and (3) the cost of
production would be too high.
</p>
<p>Librarians and readers often complain that commercial publishers are ex-
clusively, or at least overly, concerned with profit and have little concern for
quality. What these people forget is that publishing houses are businesses and
must show a profit if they are to continue to operate.
</p>
<p>In 1998, the New York Times published an article about rising book produc-
tion costs, loss of editors, and the increase in errors in books. This article noted
that there was a 16 percent decrease in the publishing workforce in New York
City between 1990 and 1998, primarily in the editorial category. It also specu-
lated about the role mergers played in the situation. One editor was quoted as
saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all become a big, fat, screaming, mean, vicious, greedy, rude, and
crude feast. . . . So little of your time is spent doing creative work that I&rsquo;m seri-
ously considering leaving.&rdquo;10 One hopes that the critical situation in New York
City does not reflect the field as a whole.
</p>
<p>Production and marketing join with the editorial team to make the final
decisions regarding production details. Most publishers can package and price
publications in a variety of ways. Some years ago, the Association of University
</p>
<p>Functions of Publishing 117</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Publishers released an interesting book, One Book Five Ways.11 The book pro-
vides a fascinating picture of how five different university presses would handle
the same project. In all five functional areas, the presses would have proceeded
differently, from contract agreement (administration), copyediting (editorial),
physical format (production), pricing and advertising (marketing), to distribu-
tion (fulfillment).
</p>
<p>Production staff consider issues such as page size, typeface, number and
type of illustrative materials, and cover design, as well as typesetting, printing,
and binding. Their input and the decision made regarding the physical form of
the item play a major role in how much the title will cost. Although electronic
and desktop publishing are changing how and who performs some production
activities, the basic issues of design, layout, use of illustrations, and use of color
remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>Marketing departments are responsible for promoting and selling the product.
They provide input about the sales potential of the title. Further, this unit often
decides how many review copies to distribute and to what review sources.
Where, when, or whether to place an ad is the responsibility of the marketing
department. All of these decisions influence the cost of the items produced.
Many small publishers use direct mail (catalogs and brochures) to market their
books. Publishers&rsquo; sales representatives visit stores, wholesalers, schools, and
libraries. When salespeople visit the library or information center, they keep the
visits short and to the point. Each visit represents a cost to the publisher, and the
company recovers the cost in some manner, most often in the price of the material.
</p>
<p>One activity for which most marketing units are responsible is exhibits. For
library personnel, conventions are one of the best places to meet publishers&rsquo; rep-
resentatives and have some input into the decision-making process. From the
publishers&rsquo; point of view, if the conferees go to the exhibits, conventions can be a
cost-effective way of reaching a large number of potential customers in a brief
time. Library staff members should also remember that the fees exhibitors pay
help underwrite the cost of the convention.
</p>
<p>Fulfillment activities are those needed to process an order as well as those
connected with the warehousing of the materials produced. In many ways, ful-
fillment is the least controllable cost factor for a publisher. Libraries and infor-
mation centers sometimes add to the cost of their purchases by requiring special
handling of their orders. Keeping special needs to a minimum can help keep
prices in check. Speeding up payments to publishers and vendors will also help
slow price increases, because the longer a publisher has to carry an outstanding
account, the more interest has to be paid. Ultimately, most increases in the cost
of doing business result in a higher price for the buyer, so whatever libraries can
do to help publishers control their fulfillment costs will also help acquisitions
budgets.
</p>
<p>For various reasons, despite strong marketing efforts, some publications do
not sell as well as expected. When this happens, sooner or later the publisher has
to dispose of the material; often these become remaindered items. A decision by
</p>
<p>118 6&mdash;Information Producers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (Thor Power Tool Co. vs. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, 439 U.S. 522 [1979]) has influenced press runs in the United
States and the speed with which publishers remainder slow-moving warehouse
stock. Remaindered items sell for a small fraction of their actual production
costs. Prior to the Thor decision, businesses would write down the value of their
inventories, or warehouse stock, to a nominal level at the end of the tax year. The
resulting loss in the value of the inventory (which was, by and large, only a paper
loss) then became a tax deduction for the company, thereby increasing the profit
margin. Since Thor, publishers can only take such a deduction if the material is
defective or offered for sale below actual production costs. Under the previous
method, publishers could find it profitable to keep slow-selling titles in their
warehouses for years. Thus far, efforts to get an exemption from the ruling for
publishers have been unsuccessful. At first, the ruling increased the number of
remaindered books, but now most publishers have cut back on the size of their
print runs in an attempt to match inventories to expected sales volume. More of-
ten than not, this means higher unit costs and retail prices. Despite all the prob-
lems for the field, U.S. total net sales income for book publishing has increased
steadily, from $14.1 billion in 1989 to an estimated $24.02 billion in 1999.12

<p>Annual sales data are available in a variety of sources: PW, The Bowker
Annual of Library &amp; Book Trade Almanac, Standard and Poor&rsquo;s Industry Sur-
veys, and so forth. Anyone concerned with acquisitions budgets must make use
of statistical data about publishing to develop intelligent budget requests and
work plans. Statistical data about the number of new titles available as paper-
backs, reprints, and so forth can be useful in planning the workload for the next
fiscal year. For example, perhaps the library will need to hire some temporary
staff or redirect efforts of existing staff, if the volume of acquisitions increases.
Knowing the pricing patterns over a period of years and the expected acquisi-
tions budget allows libraries to project workload. The two most accessible
sources of publishing statistics for the United States are PW and The Bowker
Annual. Data in both sources, and almost all other printed statistical data about
publishing, come from the American Book Producers Association (ABPA), and
not all publishers belong to the group. In fact, a great many small and regional
publishers are not members.
</p>
<p>Publishers use a variety of distribution outlets, selling directly to individ-
uals, institutions, retailers, and wholesalers. Distribution is a major problem for
both publishers and libraries because of the number of channels and the implica-
tions for acquiring a specific publication. Each channel has a different discount,
and they are accessed through different sources. Figure 6.1 illustrates in a gen-
eral way the complexity of the system. Production and distribution of informa-
tion materials, whether print or nonprint, consist of several elements, all
interacting with one another. Writers and creators of the material can and do dis-
tribute their output in several ways: directly to the community or public, to
agents who in turn pass it on to producers, or directly to the producers. Producers
seeking writers often approach agents with publication ideas. Figure 6.1 illus-
trates the variety of channels publishers use to distribute their publications to the
consumer.
</p>
<p>120 6&mdash;Information Producers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Most publishers use all these sales channels. Wholesalers, direct mail com-
panies, and retail store operators act as middlemen; a retailer may buy from the
jobber or directly from the publisher. Each seller will have different discounts
for different categories of buyers, ranging from no discount to more than 50 per-
cent. Not only are there a great many choices available to the buyer, but the
sources compete with one another. These factors combine to push up the cost of
distributing a publication, which in turn increases its list price. With multiple
outlets, different discounts, and different credit conditions, the publishing indus-
try has created a cumbersome, uneconomical distribution system.
</p>
<p>This brief overview outlines the most basic elements of publishing. Its pur-
pose is to start a technical services novice thinking about the trade. The next sec-
tion discusses nonbook producers. Unfortunately, because of their diversity, it is
not possible in a limited space to parallel the discussion of print publishing.

<p>Nonbook media producers are a diverse group working in a variety of for-
mats (sound recordings, film, video, models, and so on), making it difficult to
generalize about their operations. The following discussion is an attempt to
cover all of these nonbook formats, but it would require a full-length book to
describe all the individual variations and exceptions.
</p>
<p>Media producers enjoy substantial annual sales to schools and libraries. In
fact, this market is almost the sole sales outlet for the majority of educational
media producers. Two major exceptions are audio and videorecordings. The
audio and videorecording industries are major sources of &ldquo;other media&rdquo; for most
libraries. Recorded music, as part of a growing sound collection that includes
talking books, is a common feature of libraries, reflecting the fact that a large
segment of the general population buys or listens to music. In terms of sales,
however, libraries and other institutions represent only a fraction of the music in-
dustry&rsquo;s income.
</p>
<p>Considering average circulations per title, videorecordings are often the top
circulation format, especially in public libraries. Video collections in libraries
contain both educational and theatrical film recordings. The sales of motion pic-
ture videocassettes are far larger to the general public than to libraries, but librar-
ies (including school media centers) are the largest market for educational video.
</p>
<p>One important fact to remember about most media, with the exception of
books, is that they require the user to follow the material at a fixed pace&mdash;the
pace of the machine involved. The equipment allows for rewinding and review-
ing a section of special importance, and video players can freeze a frame, but
aside from DVDs most formats make it difficult to skip around as one can do in a
book. Interactive video and hypermedia allow for easy random access, and these
technologies are most likely to replace many of the traditional media formats li-
braries have made available. What newer formats and technology will replace
interactive systems is impossible to guess. To many people who follow develop-
ments in the field, &ldquo;virtual reality&rdquo; is an enhancement of interactive systems and
not really a new &ldquo;system.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Most media producers design products for the average ability or level of
knowledge of the target audience. In the case of educational media, the producer
assumes the item is for group presentations, with a teacher adding comments and
creating a context for the material. Although individuals working alone can ben-
efit from the material, many will gain less from the use of the item without some
interaction with an instructor. More teachers in schools and higher education are
assigning media use outside the classroom in the same way they have employed
print material to supplement the instructional program. This translates into librar-
ies and media centers receiving requests for bigger and more diverse media col-
lections, part of the &ldquo;more factor&rdquo; discussed in Chapter 3. It also means more
money is needed to acquire materials, often with the added cost of securing &ldquo;per-
formance rights&rdquo; (see Chapter 13).
</p>
<p>The primary difference between book publishers and media producers is
that media producers market a product designed primarily for group use, and
book publishers market a product designed primarily for individual use. This
</p>
<p>122 6&mdash;Information Producers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>difference has an influence on how media producers market and distribute their
products. Media producers place heavy emphasis on direct institutional sales.
Also, there is less use of wholesalers. Although some book jobbers do handle
audio and videorecordings, a large percentage of media acquisitions are made
directly from the producer.
</p>
<p>One characteristic of media production that is frequently overlooked is
authorship. Most books are the result of the intellectual effort of one or two per-
sons. Textbook publishers frequently commission books. (Perhaps in the age of
mergers, this approach will become more common for trade publications as
well.) For media, the process is opposite. Normally, the producer generates the
ideas and seeks the necessary persons to carry out the project if the company&rsquo;s
staff cannot handle the project. This means that in most cases the producers have
almost total control over the final product.
</p>
<p>Despite the producers&rsquo; control, people often think of the media field as one
of independence and freedom. One reason for this view, at least in the past, is the
relatively low cost of entering it. One hears stories about the individual who
started off with a few thousand dollars and some equipment and is now a major
producer. One does not hear about the thousands of others who tried and failed.
Mediocre equipment and a low advertising budget usually mean a mediocre
product and few, if any, sales. The opportunity is there, but the chances of suc-
cess are only slightly better than for any other business venture. High-quality
professional media production equipment is exceedingly expensive; however,
many of the so-called producers do not invest in quality equipment.
</p>
<p>Another characteristic of media producers is that their products have a
fairly high cost per unit of information conveyed. Many media items are single-
concept materials. Books, on the other hand, have a low cost per unit of informa-
tion. For example, no single film, videotape, audiotape, or set of 35mm slides
can convey the same amount of information about Native Americans as one
300-page book. This fact has budget implications for the library, as most media
cost more than do books. Today, educational videocassettes range from U.S.
$200 to $300 for educational videos to theatrical cassettes under U.S. $20. Sets
of 35mm slides range from U.S. $5 to $500. In general, the kit combinations of
media are high-profit items. Prices on such combinations run from U.S. $20 to
more than U.S. $100.
</p>
<p>Although book publishers use a multitude of outlets to sell their products,
media producers use few outlets. With the exception of audio and video stores
and a few map shops, there are no retail outlets for &ldquo;other media.&rdquo; There are no
media-of-the-month clubs (except for music recordings and videos), few
mail-order houses, and no remainder houses (except for recordings and some
videos). Even wholesalers dealing with all media are few and far between. The
main source, and in some cases the only source, is the producer. Because the
producers are the basic source, acquisitions department personnel must spend
large amounts of time and energy maintaining lists of producers&rsquo; addresses.
Without such records, schools and libraries would almost have to halt their acqui-
sition of &ldquo;other media.&rdquo; Because many producers are small and move frequently,
</p>
<p>Producers of Nonbook Materials 123</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>updating addresses is a constant problem for the library. Directories more than
twelve months old are likely to be out of date.
</p>
<p>The one advantage to this situation is that the market for media is clearly
identifiable: schools and libraries. Like the specialty publisher, the media pro-
ducer is better able to focus advertising and sales activities on a small area with a
high probability of success. Trade book publishers use a broad spectrum of ad-
vertising sources, newspapers, periodicals, flyers, radio, and television. In gen-
eral, the trade publisher must take a &ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; approach, but specialty publishers
and media producers should have a much better idea of their market.
</p>
<p>The majority of media producers are small-business owners without a large
capital reserve. For the small media producer, cash flow is a real problem. Any-
thing that the library can do to help the small media firm control its costs will
help to control the unit cost of products as well, such as using cooperative pre-
viewing and keeping order and billing procedures simple.
</p>
<p>One other important characteristic of the media field is the speed with
which its technology changes. This characteristic is a central problem for every-
one concerned, both producers and consumers. Improvements in equipment con-
stantly make existing equipment almost obsolete; occasionally, a new format
may, in fact, make equipment obsolete. Given the volatile nature of the field,
many users, with good reason, are reluctant to invest heavily in equipment. For
the producer, the problem is greater; it means deciding quickly whether to go
with the new or stay with the old. Staying with the old too long may cut the pro-
ducer out of the field because of licensing and franchising considerations, or
simply not keeping up to date. On the other hand, moving too soon may expend
precious capital on a change that does not last. Chapter 13 provides more infor-
mation about media formats and their acquisition.

lishers and media producers, differences that have an impact on acquisitions
work. It presents broad generalizations to which there are many exceptions.

</p>
<p>Figure 5.1 (p. 99) provides an overview of the acquisition process. The
steps can be divided into three broad categories: preorder, order, and postorder
activities. This chapter touches on all the steps; however, the primary focus is on
preorder activities. Chapter 8 focuses on the means of acquiring materials by
purchase or gift and exchange and postordering activities.

</p>
<p>A library&rsquo;s collection exists to achieve certain objectives: education, infor-
mation, aesthetic appreciation, recreation, and research. Each objective requires
a different mix of formats. Aesthetic appreciation often requires recorded music,
dramatic readings, and visual and graphic materials of various types. Research
objectives often require acquiring report literature and conference papers and
proceedings. The acquisition of these materials requires in-depth knowledge
about the materials and suitable sources of supply. These formats are discussed
in Chapter 5 but are briefly reviewed here.
</p>
<p>Printed Materials
</p>
<p>Books and printed materials still represent the bulk of library purchases. As
noted previously, U.S. publishers produce over 30,000 new titles each year and
more than 10,000 new editions. Most libraries only purchase a small percentage
of the total output. In addition to books, thousands of periodical and serial titles
are available in both print and electronic formats. Government documents of
national, state, local, and international scope are additional considerations for li-
braries of all sizes. Scholarly publications, dissertations, theses, and publications
of learned societies as well as atlases, maps, and globes are staples in many
library collections. Printed music, pamphlets, and ephemera of all types are also
material the acquisitions department orders and receives.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Nonbook Materials
</p>
<p>As demonstrated in Chapter 13, microfilm and microfiche are two frequently
ordered microformats. Other popular nonbook materials are audiobooks, CD
recordings, videocassettes, and DVDs. Libraries face a number of challenges in
acquiring these items, but many of the steps used to order a book apply to these
other media as well.
</p>
<p>Electronic Resources
</p>
<p>Over the past ten-plus years, electronic products have moved from being a
relatively rare acquisition to forming part of a triad of format categories that
technical services must handle on a regular basis. Within the electronic group
there are two primary types of products: databases of what are usually thought of
as reference materials (indexes and abstracting services) and full-text products
of journal articles. Increasingly the material is Web-based, but there are still a
significant number of CD-ROM products available, many of which are digitized
versions of reference materials (for example, encyclopedias and dictionaries) or
large seldom-used sets (such as American National Bibliography). Some of
these products are digitized version of titles that also exist in print and others are
original electronic titles. Chapter 11 provides more information about electronic
products as well as information about acquiring them.
</p>
<p>%�������&amp;�%���2�
�&amp;����'�(�&amp;��'"���
</p>
<p>Staffing patterns vary in acquisitions departments, but a librarian is almost
always the unit&rsquo;s immediate supervisor. As the workload increases, the library
may divide the work into several sub-units. Generally, support staff members
have the supervisory responsibility for the sub-units. A very large library might
have separate units for verification, ordering, bookkeeping, receiving, bindery
preparation, and gifts and exchange.
</p>
<p>Most verification activities are the responsibility of library support staff or
part-time help. The librarians usually only work on items the support staff could
not verify or with foreign-language materials. As staff size increases, library as-
sistants are very likely to gain supervisory responsibility in this area.
</p>
<p>Request Processing
</p>
<p>The first step in the acquisitions process is to organize the incoming re-
quests. The format of the request can range from oral requests or a scrawled note
on a napkin to a completed formal request card. Eventually, the staff organizes
all requests so they can carry out an efficient checking process. Each library will
have its own request form, typically a card produced by a library supply firm,
such as Gaylord or Brodart. To make it easier to conduct the necessary searches,
requests arriving in other forms are transferred to a request card. Sometimes,
</p>
<p>130 7&mdash;Acquisition Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>when selectors use a trade bibliography (such as Publishers Weekly) or national
one (such as Canadiana or the National Library of Canada&rsquo;s Forthcoming
Books), they simply check desired items in the publication, and the searchers
work with the entire publication rather than transferring everything to request
cards. (Despite the electronic aspects of acquisitions work, there is a rather large
dependence on paper-based forms, especially for international titles. It may be
some time before that dependence disappears.)
</p>
<p>Commercially produced request cards cover all the categories of informa-
tion called for in the Guidelines for Handling Library Orders for In-Print Mono-
graphic Publications1: author, title, publisher, date of publication, edition, ISBN
or ISSN, Standard Address Number (SAN), price, and number of copies. Many
provide space for other information that is of interest only to libraries, such as re-
quester&rsquo;s name, series, vendor, funding source, and approval signature. For any
person not familiar with library or book trade practice, the most confusing item
on the request card is the space labeled &ldquo;date/year.&rdquo; Many nonlibrary requesters
often assume the library wants the date they filled out the form, rather than the
items&rsquo; copyright or publication date. Anyone with acquisitions department expe-
rience knows how often this confusion takes place. If the form specifically calls
for the date of publication, there will be no problem.
</p>
<p>Many patrons request items already in the collection because they do not
know how to use the public catalog effectively. People occasionally combine or
confuse authors&rsquo; names, titles, publishers, and so forth. Therefore, bibliographic
searching is the next step in acquisitions work. (Sample request forms are illus-
trated in Figures 7.1, page 132, and 7.2, page 133.)
</p>
<p>Liz Chapman has provided a good six-point checklist for designing or se-
lecting a request form:2
</p>
<p>1. Is it easy for users to fill in?
</p>
<p>2. Does it provide a logical checking route for library staff?
</p>
<p>3. Does the checked form reflect the order in which data will be input
to the order system or put onto an order form?
</p>
<p>4. Does it provide an accessible format for checking during the stage
after the book has been ordered but before it has arrived?
</p>
<p>5. Does it provide an efficient format for checking that the book you
receive is the one you ordered?
</p>
<p>6. Will it be able to move with the book from acquisitions through
cataloging and processing?

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preorder Work&mdash;Verification
</p>
<p>Bibliographic verification or searching consists of two steps: searching to
establish the existence of a particular item and searching to determine whether
the library needs to order the item. In the first case, the concern is with identify-
ing the correct author, title, publisher, and other necessary ordering data. In the
second case, the process determines whether the library already owns the item
(perhaps received, but not yet represented in the public catalog), whether there is
a need for a second copy or multiple copies, and whether the item has been or-
dered but not received. Integrated automated library systems make this latter step
quick and easy, except for determining the need for additional copies. Many sys-
tems show ordered and received status in the online public catalog, which tends
to reduce the number of requests that duplicate existing orders. (Some vendors
are now offering this type of service, for a fee, of course. A few vendors may be
able to actually Telnet, or otherwise gain access, to the library&rsquo;s OPAC and de-
termine if the item already exists in the system. A potential problem with this is
that the library may want a second copy or the item is to be a replacement copy.
When using a vendor for this activity, there must be a system in place to handle
such cases.)
</p>
<p>Where does the process begin? The answer depends on the collection de-
velopment system employed by the library. Although it is true that all requests
require searching, it also is true that not all request cards have sufficient correct
information to search accurately. If the majority of information comes from bib-
liographies, dealers&rsquo; catalogs, publishers&rsquo; flyers, or forms filled out by experi-
enced selection personnel, then determining the need is generally the most
efficient way to start.

<p>A survey by Karen Schmidt of preorder searching indicates that between 30
and 40 percent of nonlibrarian requests are incorrect or for items already in the
collection.3 When a large percentage of the requests are from nonlibrarians, it is
advisable to start with determining the existence of the title as requested.
</p>
<p>One of the major activities for preorder searchers is establishing the correct
author (main entry). Some requestors, usually nonlibrarians, know little about
cataloging rules of entry. Even bibliographers may not keep up-to-date on rule
changes. Knowing something about main entry rules, as well as how the standard
bibliographic sources list titles, will save search time.
</p>
<p>Corporate authors (see Chapter 17), conference papers, proceedings, or
transactions are the most troublesome to search. If the department maintains its
paper-based order files by title rather than main entry order, it may be possible to
reduce bibliographic training to a minimum while improving accuracy. Titles do
not change after publication and are easier to search. On the other hand, catalog-
ers&rsquo; decisions about the proper main entry may change several times between the
time of the request and the time the item is on the shelf. Main entry searching re-
quires a greater knowledge of cataloging rules, which, in turn, requires more
time for training searchers and more time spent searching.
</p>
<p>There are some common problems to be aware of when checking bibliogra-
phies. One obvious problem is variant spellings of an author&rsquo;s name, both first
and last, such as the last names Smith, Smythe, Johnson, or Johnsen or a first
name such as Gail, Gale, or Gayle. Another problem is variations of the author&rsquo;s
name, for example, Ed Evans, Edward Evans, Edward G. Evans, G. Edward
Evans, Gayle Edward Evans, or Gayle E. Evans. Each of these variations has ap-
peared on at least one of Evans&rsquo;s publications. Corporate author entries provide
even bigger challenges to the searcher&rsquo;s imagination and ingenuity. Collected
works and joint authors also present challenges for the searcher. Searchers must
understand bibliographic rules of entry. They must also use their imagination
when working with problem requests. Some libraries maintain a name-authority
file, especially libraries with online catalogs, which can be of great assistance
with variant forms of a name.
</p>
<p>If the author main entry search procedure does not verify 60 percent to 90
percent of the items, the staff should review the procedure. It is probable that
either the requests lack adequate information (requiring additional education or
training for the requesters), or the staff is searching the wrong verification tools.
A title search should verify most, if not all, the requests that cannot be verified by
author main entry. Occasionally, it is impossible to verify an item using the sub-
mitted information. At that point, all the department can do is contact the re-
quester to try to acquire additional information. If the requester cannot provide
additional information, a subject search may produce a verification.
</p>
<p>The success rate of subject searches is low for several reasons. First, some
bibliographies do not provide subject access, making it impossible to search all
the commonly used bibliographies. A more critical reason is that the assignment
of subjects is somewhat arbitrary. Even with a work in hand, two individuals
may well provide two different subject categories for the same title. Searchers
must look under as many subjects as seem likely and still can never be certain
</p>
<p>134 7&mdash;Acquisition Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>they have examined all the appropriate headings. Because of its low success rate,
subject verification is a last resort for urgently needed items.
</p>
<p>Occasionally, it is necessary to examine three or four sources to establish
all of the required order information. One may quickly find the author, title, pub-
lisher, date of publication, and price, but it may be difficult to find information
determining whether the item is in a series. Failure to identify series information
may lead to unwanted duplication. For example, one copy may be received on a
series standing order and another copy from a direct order. Books in Series was
helpful but is no longer published. The 1991 edition covered only the United
States and contained 37,619 series with more than 326,688 titles.4 There is no
good single source for this information today, and the problem has only in-
creased with libraries receiving unwanted duplicates. If caught early enough in
the receiving process, it &ldquo;only&rdquo; costs library staff time to resolve the issue and re-
turn the unwanted material. Not catching the duplication before items are prop-
erty marked or stamped results in the library having two copies, needed or not.
</p>
<p>There are several files to check when establishing the library&rsquo;s need for an
item; this is true whether the file is paper or electronic. The most obvious start-
ing point is the OPAC. A searcher should look first under the assumed main en-
try; if the results are negative and there is some doubt as to validity of the main
entry, then a title search is appropriate. Many librarians suggest that checkers
begin with the title because there tends to be less variation and doubt. In some
libraries, even if there is an online public catalog, there may be several other
paper-based public catalogs to search, for example, special collections or a
media catalog, and all should be part of the checking process, if appropriate.
Audiovisual materials, government documents, serials, and collections in spe-
cial locations often are not fully represented in the OPAC or main card catalog.
Other public service files that searchers need to examine are those for lost,
missing, or damaged items (replacement files). The searcher would not exam-
ine all of these files for all items, but merely for those popular items not marked
&ldquo;added copy&rdquo; or &ldquo;replacement.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>There are files that are unavailable to the public that searchers may have to
examine to determine whether the item is already somewhere in the acquisitions
or cataloging process. If the library has a manual system, there are usually three
files to consult: the in-process file, the verified requests file (items awaiting typ-
ing on order forms), and the standing order file. The in-process file represents
books on order, books received but not yet sent to cataloging, and books in the
cataloging department. The standing order file represents items that will arrive
automatically from a supplier and that may end the search.
</p>
<p>Online systems are available in many libraries to speed preorder checking.
Books in Print is available in both online and CD-ROM formats, as well as in the
traditional print version. Other commercial bibliographic selection aids are also
available in electronic formats. Bibliographic utilities such as OCLC and RLIN
provide large bibliographic databases that are useful in verification and search-
ing. Integrated automation systems have eased the workload on some aspects of
acquisitions. For example, it is possible to download bibliographic data from a
bibliographic utility. With some systems, the staff can use the downloaded data
to prepare a computer-generated order form, provide an online status report,
</p>
<p>General Organization and Procedures 135</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and create the basis for local cataloging work. In some libraries, a person respon-
sible for preorder activities may be able to do 90 percent or more of the work at
one terminal merely by logging on and off the integrated system and the biblio-
graphic utility.
</p>
<p>Bibliographic verification, the first step in the acquisitions procedure, is
perhaps the most interesting and challenging duty in this department. The at-
tempt to establish an item&rsquo;s existence when there is very little information is sim-
ilar to detective work.
</p>
<p>Searching Sources
</p>
<p>Today one can carry out searching activities relatively quickly, if the li-
brary has an OPAC and has access to the Internet as well as the appropriate data-
bases. In the not so distant past, the searching process was very labor intensive
using a variety of print-based resources. Obviously, libraries lacking an OPAC
or Internet access must still depend on the print sources. We devote only a small
amount of space to the print materials here because they play an ever-decreasing
role in preorder work in most libraries.
</p>
<p>This section begins by describing some of the most frequently used bibliog-
raphies for printed materials. A bibliography is a publication that lists and de-
scribes information materials of any type. The term generally applies to lists of
books, but in its broadest sense, it includes all materials (print or nonprint).
</p>
<p>The types of bibliographies most frequently used in verification work are
national, trade, and general bibliographies. A national bibliography (e.g.,
Canadiana) has four functions, to list all works (1) about the country, (2) pro-
duced in the country, (3) written by citizens, and (4) written while citizens of a
foreign country were resident in the country. A trade bibliography lists current
in-print books judged to be of interest to the general book-buying public (e.g.,
American Book Publishing Record). A general bibliography lists all books or
items that exist in the collection of a particular library or on a particular subject
(e.g., Library of Congress Catalog).
</p>
<p>Other types of bibliographies are retrospective, current, and comprehen-
sive. A retrospective bibliography lists older items not generally available (e.g.,
Books Relating to America from Its Discovery to the Present Time). Never as-
sume, however, that items that are several hundred years old are not available.
The activity of reprint publishers has brought many older works back into print.
In practice, the terms retrospective bibliography, out-of-print bibliography, and
out-of-print catalog are almost synonymous, although the latter two imply that
the items listed are not generally available. A current bibliography lists items
that are presently available or forthcoming (e.g., Subject Guide to Children&rsquo;s
Books in Print). This is the type most frequently used in bibliographic verifica-
tion work. The final type is the comprehensive bibliography, which is useful to-
day for retrospective items (e.g., National Union Catalog).
</p>
<p>Actually, many bibliographies are a combination of several of these types.
For example, one commonly used source in the past was the series of Library of
Congress (LC) catalogs. These are general bibliographies in that they include
only the books acquired and cataloged by LC. Nevertheless, they also serve as a
</p>
<p>136 7&mdash;Acquisition Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>major segment of the U.S. national bibliography series because they include a
very high percentage of all the books published in the United States.
</p>
<p>Yet in another sense, LC&rsquo;s catalogs are general comprehensive bibliogra-
phies because they contain current and retrospective materials. The British Mu-
seum Catalog of Printed Books would be another example of a general
comprehensive catalog. Therefore, keep in mind that the inclusion of the name of
a country or a library in its title does not necessarily mean that a bibliography is
solely national in scope. The catalogs of both the British Library and LC repre-
sent national bibliographies, but they also are more than that. They are general
and national bibliographies. A strictly national bibliography that is also a trade
and current bibliography is Books in Print (BIP), which lists books currently
available from a number of U.S. publishers and from other countries that have
publishing activities in the United States. A national retrospective bibliography
that a searcher may encounter is Joseph Sabin&rsquo;s aforementioned Dictionary of
Books Relating to America from Its Discovery to the Present Time, published in
1892.
</p>
<p>U.S. Sources
</p>
<p>The Bowker Company is the mainstay in publishing current U.S. trade bib-
liographies. They are also taking on an ever-increasing role in the bibliographic
control of English-language publishing around the world in conjunction with the
UK firm of Whitaker. Their publications make acquisitions work less compli-
cated and time-consuming. Bowker publishes a series of bibliographies that list
new titles from a U.S. publisher&rsquo;s first announcement of a new title until the pub-
lisher declares it out-of-print. Although acquisitions departments use all of the
Bowker publications, either in print or electronic versions, a few receive very
heavy use. We focus here on those high-use titles. The following are major
Bowker bibliographic publications for books; the company has other publica-
tions that are useful in the acquisition of other formats:
</p>
<p>Forthcoming Books
</p>
<p>American Book Publishing Record
</p>
<p>Books in Print
</p>
<p>Books Out-of-Print
</p>
<p>Subject Guide to Books in Print
</p>
<p>Forthcoming Books (FB) and its subject guide is a useful bimonthly publi-
cation for acquisitions departments to check on the status of announced titles.
Publishers submit information to Bowker about titles they expect to publish in
the near future, anywhere from two to five months out. Occasionally, publishers
submit information before receiving the book&rsquo;s manuscript. Once in a while the
manuscript never does come in, so the title announced in FB never appears. A
more frequent problem occurs when the title changes, which means that the
</p>
<p>General Organization and Procedures 137</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>published work will not appear under its originally announced title. FB also pro-
vides information about postponements and price changes. Changes in main en-
try between the announcement and the publication of the book also create
verification headaches. Because of these limitations, searchers use FB primarily
for problem verification work. That is, it is useful to check on requests that can-
not be verified elsewhere or on vendor reports that an ordered title is &ldquo;NYP&rdquo; (not
yet published). FB arranges works by author and title; an asterisk next to an entry
indicates an item is appearing for the first time. Entries in FB have pub-
lisher-generated annotations that can be helpful in selecting items, as long as one
keeps in mind that a publisher is not going to say this item is not very good or has
limited appeal. Users must keep in mind that the publication is based on informa-
tion publishers submit to the Bowker staff. They do not attempt to verify the in-
formation for accuracy, nor do they engage in follow-up activities on such issues
as postponements or price changes.
</p>
<p>American Book Publishing Record (ABPR) currently is the starting point
for U.S. trade bibliographies. ABPR is a monthly listing of books published in
the previous month. The author and title indexes are the primary points of access
for verification and order purposes, although a subject search is also possible.
ABPR is the one source that allows a good chance of finding an item when the
searcher must attempt to verify something using the subject approach.
</p>
<p>The ABPR does an excellent job and is as comprehensive as the Bowker
staff can make it; however, it does have some major limitations. The most impor-
tant are that (1) it lists only books of forty-nine or more pages, (2) publishers
must submit title information for inclusion (Bowker does not seek out this infor-
mation), and (3) it does not include serial publications. Changes in coverage do
occur, so it is wise to check introductory statements periodically. However, de-
spite these limitations, several factors make ABPR an essential tool in larger
technical services departments. As indicated, it is the first and the most compre-
hensive listing of a book&rsquo;s availability in the United States. Another important
factor is that each entry usually provides full cataloging information. The ABPR
gets most of its cataloging information from the LCMARC records and a limited
amount from cataloging done by Bowker&rsquo;s staff.
</p>
<p>Verification through ABPR will yield information complete enough for
order work. Nevertheless, using ABPR for verification work is time consuming
because, with very few exceptions, a book only appears once. ABPR is a
monthly, so the searcher may have to search many issues unless he or she knows
the book&rsquo;s publication date. There is the option of using the annual volume, if the
library is willing to accept a gap in current publications. Very often acquisitions
departments receive a copy of ABPR with the desired items marked by a selec-
tion officer. In that case, all the searcher needs to do is make certain the item is
not already on order. The annual cumulation volumes are a separate subscrip-
tion, not part of the basic monthly service.
</p>
<p>For retrospective searching, the American Book Publishing Record cumu-
lative sets are very useful. There are three sets covering 1970&ndash;1974, 1975&ndash;1979,
and 1980&ndash;1984. The volumes have information on more than 490,000 titles
</p>
<p>138 7&mdash;Acquisition Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>published in the United States during the time covered and that have gone out-of-
print in most cases. Entries are arranged by Dewey class number and each set has
author, title, and subject indexes.
</p>
<p>Books in Print (BIP) is an annual publication with a mid-year supplement.
Thus, in theory, the searcher should only need to consult Forthcoming Books and
American Book Publishing Record for the latest books. But as noted, this is not
always the case. Occasionally, books disappear for a few months and then reap-
pear in the listings. Because BIP has become so valuable to booksellers and
libraries, all major U.S. publishers submit information about their current lists of
books (in print). (Note: Many small specialty and regional publishers do not sub-
mit information.) BIP is a multiple-volume author-title set in which the searcher
can find the most complete information under the author entry. There is also a
subject guide, so the searcher can gain access to information in a variety of ways.
Both FB and BIP subject guides use the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(see Chapter 19 for a description of LCSH).
</p>
<p>Books in Print comes in a variety of electronic versions as well as print.
There is an Internet edition available from Bowker (www.booksinprint.com/bip)
as well as from some book jobbers or through a database such as Firstsearch. As
of July 2001, the online version contained 3.5 million book titles, 300,000 videos,
and 120,000 audiocassettes. It also included 1.3 million out-of-print titles (mir-
roring the print format, Books Out-of-Print) as well as book reviews from a
dozen sources and fourteen media sources. BIP On DISCTM comes in either
DOS, Mac, or Windows versions. The electronic versions provide faster access
as well as more ways to search for information that are almost impossible in the
print edition. For example, search by type or genre of book, limited edition, or
technical monographs. Another plus is that one can order electronically from
more than twenty-five jobbers and publishers.
</p>
<p>Bowker puts out a print set that allows searchers to do some subject search-
ing, if the library does not have access to an electronic version of BIP. Subject
Guide to Books in Print only covers nonfiction titles. Works to which the Library
of Congress does not assign subject headings (fiction, poetry, drama, and bibles)
do not appear in Subject Guide to Books in Print. However, an exception is made
for collections and criticism of fiction and poetry and for individual works of fic-
tion whose subject background seems &ldquo;extensive enough to warrant mention.&rdquo;
Entries are in alphabetical order under LCSH and include the same bibliographic
information provided by BIP. Juvenile books usually appear separately under
subject headings designed for this purpose; however, sometimes they are listed
with adult books. No matter where they are the user can always determine their
grade level.
</p>
<p>Books in Print and its companion, Subject Guide to Books in Print, are the
basic tools for determining both availability and price of a book published in the
United States. Keep in mind that information supplied by publishers comes in
during the spring and early summer and that the new edition of BIP does not
come out until the fall (usually in October). A time lag of that length is particu-
larly significant when using BIP to determine prices. No printed bibliographic
tool can be completely accurate and up-to-date, because publishers can and do
change prices and reschedule publishing dates whenever necessary. The online
</p>
<p>General Organization and Procedures 139</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>version addresses some of these issues. The CD-ROM product is slower but is
updated monthly. Forthcoming Books supplements BIP, serving as a bimonthly
cumulative index to books published after the summer closing date for the cur-
rent BIP and to forthcoming books.
</p>
<p>Another of the BIP spin-off products is a CD-ROM entitled Books in Print
Plus with Book Reviews On DiscTM, available in Windows only. Updated bi-
monthly, this service is particularly useful in libraries that have a policy of not
ordering items that lack a published review. (Most often it is public libraries and
school media centers that have such requirements.) The CD includes the full-text
reviews from publications such as Library Journal, Publishers Weekly, School
Library Journal, Choice, Booklist, Reference and Research Book News,
Sci-Tech Book News, University Press Book News, and BIOSIS.
</p>
<p>Books Out-of-Print CD-ROM covers 1979&ndash;2001 and is a source for verify-
ing items vendors report as out-of-print, out-of-stock indefinitely, or back-ordered.
It can help cut the cost of continued searching and the unproductive holding of
funds (encumbered) for items that never will arrive. The data are collected di-
rectly from the 6,000 participating publishers. The quarterly updates add to the
growing number of OP titles in the database.
</p>
<p>Other Bowker publications include such specialized bibliographies as
Medical and Health Care Books and Serials in Print, Children&rsquo;s Books in Print,
The Complete Directory of Large Print Books and Serials, and El-Hi Textbooks
and Serials in Print. In addition, Bowker offers a range of titles to assist in the ac-
quisition of books from around the world. Starting with the co-produced
Bowker/Whitaker Global Books on DISC&trade;, there are several products of great
value to acquisitions departments that actively collect outside their national
boundaries. Global Books covers titles from Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
the United Kingdom, and the United States. Bowker and Whitaker staff also try
to identify English-language publications no matter where they are published.
This product is also available online through www.globalbooksinprint.com.
Other titles in the Bowker line include Italian Books in Print and African Books
in Print.
</p>
<p>Canadian Sources
</p>
<p>Canadiana (National Library of Canada) is a comprehensive bibliography
of post-1950 Canadian materials, including book and nonbook materials, period-
icals, and electronic documents. The printed edition ceased publication in 1991
and the microfiche edition at the end of 2000. Canadiana is now available on
CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and as an online service. Forthcoming Books, a free
publication of the National Library, is also an excellent acquisitions tool. All Na-
tional Library publications are bilingual and include English- and French-language
publications. Canadiana provides full cataloging records and Forthcoming
Books, Canadian Cataloguing-in-Publication (CCIP) data.
</p>
<p>Canadian Books in Print (University of Toronto Press, 1975- ) publishes
two volumes per year, an author/title index and a subject index. The 2001 edition
has 48,148 entries, including 4,512 with a 2000 imprint. This is a listing of pre-
dominantly English-language publications based on information supplied by
</p>
<p>140 7&mdash;Acquisition Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>publishers and includes French-language titles published by Canadian publishers
outside Quebec. The hardcover annual edition is followed by complete micro-
fiche editions in April, July, and October.
</p>
<p>The Canadian Book Review Annual is a print publication that provides 200-
to 400-word reviews of English-language trade, scholarly, and reference books
that are published in Canada and written by Canadians or those residing in Can-
ada. Each review provides CCIPs. The same company also publishes Children&rsquo;s
Literature.
</p>
<p>Books in Print, Canadian Edition (Bowker) covers the books and audio titles
available from all Canadian publishers and distributors, with Canadian prices.
This listing includes books published in the United States and elsewhere that are
distributed through Canadian agencies. The 2001 edition has information on
over 100,000 titles only available in Canada.
</p>
<p>Books in Canada (Canadian Review of Books Ltd.) is a periodical that is
published nine times a year. It is selective, with some long reviews and feature
articles.
</p>
<p>There are several additional review sources for materials for children and
young adults. These are not comprehensive because they rely on the willingness
of publishers to submit their books for review. The following two sources are
examples. Resource Links, a print periodical published five times a year
(resourcelinks@nfld.com), reviews book and nonbook English- and French-
language materials. CM: Canadian Review of Materials (www.umanitoba.ca/cm)
is a free online service that provides reviews of English- and French-language
books, CD-ROMs, sound and videorecordings, as well as foreign books sold in
Canada by Canadian distributors. It is published by the Manitoba Library Asso-
ciation and updated biweekly from September to June. A print version was pub-
lished by the Canadian Library Association from 1971 to 1994 under the title
Canadian Materials. Back issues of this journal are available in the CM online
archive.
</p>
<p>In addition to the comprehensive list in Canadiana, those seeking only
books published in Quebec can consult Bibliographie du Qu&eacute;bec (Biblioth&egrave;que
nationale du Qu&eacute;bec), which provides bibliographic records (with subject head-
ings in French) for books, microforms, printed music, maps, serials, sound re-
cordings, and electronic resources published in Quebec.
</p>
<p>Biblio-Data has a complete list of all titles available in French, including a
selection of government publications of interest to the public and generally
available through bookstores. It does not include maps, sheet music, news-
papers, periodicals, and microfiches, or annuals not considered to be of general
interest.
</p>
<p>Because of Canada&rsquo;s small population, small Canadian publishers print
limited runs of works that deal with Canadian topics. To be certain of obtaining
these works, some libraries place prepublication orders selected from their trade
catalogs.

<p>UK Sources
</p>
<p>Bookseller (Whitaker, formerly J. Whitaker &amp; Sons) provides a weekly list-
ing of trade books in an author, title, subject arrangement. Several distinctions
exist between Bookseller and the weekly British National Bibliography (BNB),
published by the British Library. First, Bookseller lists only trade books, and
BNB lists everything received for copyright. Second, Bookseller lists British and
U.S. titles, whereas BNB covers only British books. Note also that Bookseller
lists new issues and cheap editions that are sometimes omitted from U.S. bibliog-
raphies. Whitaker also provides an online version of Bookseller.
</p>
<p>Whitaker&rsquo;s Books in Print (WBIP) (Whitaker) is the equivalent of BIP in
the United States. An annual publication, its information is &ldquo;the definitive source
of bibliographic data . . . of English language titles published in the UK, Ireland,
and in Europe.&rdquo;5 Whitaker&rsquo;s staff updates information such as price before issu-
ing WBIP. A monthly microfiche service helps maintain its currency. Its author,
title, and subject approach makes it a very useful searching tool. Entries also pro-
vide series information, which can be most valuable. Note that the only complete
bibliographic entry is under the author, or under the title if there is no author. The
data in WBIP are also available online through Whitaker&rsquo;s BookBank.
</p>
<p>British National Bibliography (BNB) (British Library) is an annual publica-
tion that lists new British books received by &ldquo;The Agent for the Copyright Li-
braries.&rdquo; It allows for an author, title, or series search. Libraries can also
subscribe to this publication in a microfiche format or gain online access. The
online version is UK MARC and contains post-1950 materials.
</p>
<p>British Museum General Catalog (British Museum) is similar to the Li-
brary of Congress Catalog. Because of the great size of the British Museum col-
lections, however, it is not up-to-date. In 1979, the museum announced a project
intended to generate a new complete, up-to-date catalog. In the older volumes,
the amount of information available varies depending on when the library cata-
loged the item. There is minimal information for most early works and full cata-
loging information for contemporary titles. A subject index exists for the set, but
volumes are slow in appearing. The greatest difficulty in using this catalog stems
from the fact that the rules of entry varied over time. This is particularly true of
works that require a corporate author entry.
</p>
<p>The British Library also publishes Books in English. Whereas BNB is for
British imprints only (items received for UK copyright), Books in English (BIE)
is worldwide in coverage. The bimonthly issues are cumulated annually. Full
bibliographic data appear only under the main entry. BIE is available in micro-
fiche; one set covers 1971 to 1980. At this writing, the other issues were avail-
able only as annual sets. Because the set includes data from the Library of
Congress, it can be a very useful source.
</p>
<p>Whitaker also produces BookBank OP, which lists over 1.4 million UK
titles that have gone out-of-print since 1970. There are quarterly updates.
</p>
<p>There are many other national equivalents to BIP and WBIP: Australian
Books in Print (D. W. Thorpe), New Zealand Books in Print (D. W. Thorpe),
Italian Books in Print (K. G. Saur), and German Books in Print (K. G. Saur).

<p>Serials Sources
</p>
<p>The ordering and verification procedures for serials are very similar to
those for books. There are, however, several important differences. It is essential
that the verification process establish an accurate price and the title and fre-
quency of publication. Price is an issue because serials represent an ongoing
expense for the library, and recently, the annual rate of increase in subscription
prices has far exceeded the general inflation rate. Knowing the precise current
price will assist the selection officer in making the final decision whether to
subscribe.
</p>
<p>A number of specialized jobbers deal exclusively or extensively with li-
braries&rsquo; periodicals and serials needs. Among these are Faxon Company,
EBSCO, and Blackwell&rsquo;s. Most of the jobbers supply catalogs listing the serials
they handle on a regular basis and prices for various delivery options. For exam-
ple, a library may want to receive its foreign serials by air rather than by surface
mail. Naturally, there are different costs associated with each option. Another
example is newspapers that may be available in different editions. (For more in-
formation about these variations, see Chapter 10.) The only way to accurately
determine the current price is to call the jobber. Printed prices are likely to be too
low, especially those in bibliographies or guides.
</p>
<p>It is extremely important to establish the correct title because most libraries
arrange their check-in files by title. If the cover title and the title used to place the
subscription are different, the staff will spend unnecessary time and effort in
determining the status when the first issue arrives. A related concern is the fre-
quency of publication. This is especially true when the library has an automated
serials control system, because there is a need to record the expected interval
time between issues. Normally the basic information for the new subscription is
input when the library places the order.
</p>
<p>Serials order work varies from library to library. Usually, a library orders
only a few new titles each year. Nevertheless, there are annual payment activities
associated with serials. Most orders are on a &ldquo;til forbidden&rdquo; basis. That is, the
jobber renews the subscription for the library automatically until notified to the
contrary. This approach eliminates the need for typing renewal orders each year,
thus saving valuable staff time.
</p>
<p>Several commercial guides and bibliographies for serials exist that both
selectors and acquisition staff need to be familiar with. The sources are of little
value for pricing information, but they are invaluable for locating information
about publishers&rsquo; addresses, editorial policy, which indexing or abstracting ser-
vices include the title, and what titles are available on a given subject.
</p>
<p>Ulrich&rsquo;s Periodicals DirectoryTM 2001 (Bowker), is an annual one-source
approach that helps speed up the verification work by providing information
about the publication frequency. The 39th edition covers 164,000 serials world-
wide as well as information about 7,550 titles that ceased publication since the
last edition. It also provides information on more than 20,000 Internet, online,
and CD-ROM serials. Its coverage of U.S. newspapers is sound for dailies and
weeklies (6,700) but is not as strong for non-U.S. titles. Like BIP, it is available
in several formats: book, CD-ROM, and online.

<p>Although The Serials Directory (EBSCO Information Services) is an irreg-
ular jobber&rsquo;s publication, its broad international coverage&mdash;over 150,000
titles&mdash;makes it useful in any library, even if it does not use EBSCO&rsquo;s services.
Searchers can identify online and CD-ROM serials, peer review journals, con-
trolled circulation titles, which publications accept advertising, and, very impor-
tant, which journals are registered with the Copyright Clearance Center through
various indexes and the main entry. As are many of the Bowker products, The
Serials Directory is available on CD-ROM and online.
</p>
<p>One of the strengths of The Standard Periodical Directory (Oxbridge Com-
munications, irregular) is its in-depth coverage of North American serials, more
than 75,000 titles. It has strong newspaper coverage and is a very useful source
for those collecting newsletters.
</p>
<p>The Gale Directory of Publications and Broadcast Media (Gale Group)
was formerly Ayer Directory of Publications. An annual, it covers newspapers,
magazines, and journals as well as radio and television stations and cable sys-
tems. It is particularly useful for verifying newspapers.
</p>
<p>New Serial Titles (Library of Congress, irregular) covers new serials re-
ceived by the Library of Congress and more than 700 cooperating libraries.
There are annual, five-year, and twenty-year cumulations. This is a good source
to use when trying to determine if the title you are searching for ever did exist.
Unfortunately, LC stopped printing the section that listed title changes and titles
known to have ceased.
</p>
<p>Media Sources
</p>
<p>The most reliable source for establishing the required information for
media products is producers&rsquo; catalogs. Any library buying media must maintain
an extensive file of producers&rsquo; catalogs. Book publishers&rsquo; catalogs are not as
critical because BIP and WBIP list most of the commercial publications. Unfor-
tunately, there are no equally comprehensive equivalents for media materials.
Bibliographic control of this field is improving, but records are still rather cha-
otic. Therefore, the producer&rsquo;s catalog is a most important verification tool. Be-
cause there are thousands of producers&rsquo; catalogs, we discuss only selected
general commercial tools here. In Canada producers&rsquo; catalogs are particularly
important because many producers will not deal with wholesalers.
</p>
<p>AV Market PlaceTM 2001 (Bowker) is one of the most useful general media
directories. It covers producers and distributors of AV software; equipment man-
ufacturers; companies that provide cataloging, film processing, or media ser-
vice; media associations; reference books; and review journals (more than 7,500
firms). Each major section is an alphabetical listing by company name, followed
by indexes classified by media subject or product type. Coverage is good but not
comprehensive. This book is not an evaluation tool but a directory.
</p>
<p>The Software EncyclopediaTM 2001 (Bowker) provides information about
almost 33,000 computer programs. Words on CassetteTM 2001 (Bowker) lists
over 90,000 audiocassettes. Both provide adequate information for ordering. In
Words, only the title entries provide adequate ordering data; however, the user
can search by author, reader, or performer. Bowker&rsquo;s Audio &amp; Video DatabaseTM

<p>2001 is a CD-ROM combination of Words and its Video (see below) publications
and available in either Windows or MS-DOS with quarterly updates.
</p>
<p>Another general resource is from the National Information Center for Edu-
cational Media (NICEM). Its databases have succeeded Educational Media Index.
This is without doubt the most comprehensive source for information about edu-
cational nonbook materials produced in North America and the United King-
dom. It also contains materials in Spanish, French, German, and 130 other
languages. If the library does not have online access or a PC with a CD-ROM
drive, it will be unable to take advantage of this service. All the print publica-
tions, with the exception of the NICEM Thesaurus, have been discontinued.
</p>
<p>As of August 2001, the NICEM database contained over 465,000 biblio-
graphic records for more than 650,000 nonprint items. The database is search-
able by title, date of production, age/grade level, subject area, and media type.
MARC records are available for printing or downloading into an OPAC. It oper-
ates on Macintosh or Windows PCs with any Web browser. Although it is avail-
able directly from NICEM, as of August 2001 three vendors also offer the
product: SilverPlatter (A-V Online), EBSCOhost (NICEM AV), and The Library
Corporation (A-V MARC). SilverPlatter and The Library Corporation also have
CD versions.
</p>
<p>There are many nonbook media formats (see Chapter 13). NICEM uses fif-
teen &ldquo;major media types&rdquo;; however, most of the major types have several
sub-types and a few have a large number (the audiotapes/cassettes category has
twenty-two sub-types). Reviewing the NICEM types and sub-types makes it
clear why searching for media requires careful attention to detail as well as full
understanding of the types of media equipment the library owns.
</p>
<p>The Video Source Book (Gale Group) is a sound guide to both educational
and entertainment videos. There were almost 160,000 programs in the 2001 edi-
tion. Arranged in alphabetical title order, the entries provide brief annotations as
well as running time, format, recommended use (e.g., home, institutional, and
CCTV), audience, producer, distributor, and how to acquire the item (rent, lease,
purchase, or off-air recording). A subject index provides access to the educa-
tional content; for the entertainment videos there are genre listings (e.g., fantasy,
mystery, science fiction, westerns). Despite the large number of titles covered,
the searcher will have to consult other sources if there is a need to comprehen-
sively cover educational materials.
</p>
<p>Another source is Bowker&rsquo;s Complete Video DirectoryTM 2001. It is a
four-volume set that covers both entertainment videos and educational mate-
rials; each volume contains its own index. The 2001 edition listed 250,000 titles.
There are several features that make this set especially useful. Entries include
citations to published reviews and, for educational items, indicate previewing in-
formation. A Spanish-language index, series index, and laser disc/DVD index all
provide useful access points. It is also probably the best general starting point
when the library needs to acquire non-U.S. entertainment films. Like most of the
other Bowker citation publications, this is also available on CD-ROM.
</p>
<p>Film Index International (British Film Institute) is an annual that covers
more than 90,000 entertainment films produced worldwide in its latest edition
(2000). It is available on CD-ROM from Chadwyck-Healey, Inc.

<p>The British Library produces The British Film &amp; Video Guide on a quar-
terly basis. This is a listing of films and videotapes available for rent (noncom-
mercial use) or purchase in the United Kingdom. Coverage includes educational
and training films, independent productions, and documentaries as well as
broadcast television programming and feature films.
</p>
<p>A semiannual publication is the Library of Congress Catalog&mdash;Music,
Books on Music and Sound Recordings (Library of Congress 1973- , current
semiannual issue and annual cumulation). This catalog covers music scores, disk
recordings, and (since 1963) librettos and books about music. The main entry is
under the name of the composer or author. The catalog includes subject entries as
well as added entries. All entries are from LC&rsquo;s cataloging program. The catalog
includes records from all producers, but emphasis is on commercial rather than
educational recordings. Classical music, pop and contemporary vocal instru-
mental music, dramatic readings, motion picture soundtracks, children&rsquo;s records,
and sacred music are all included.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress also publishes a catalog titled National Union Cat-
alog: Audiovisual Materials, with quarterly updates. This is a compilation of
bibliographic records for motion pictures, videorecordings, filmstrips, sets of
transparences, slide sets, and kits cataloged by LC. In addition, there is an at-
tempt being made to catalog materials released in the United States or Canada
that have educational or instructional value. At present, LC catalogs kits only if it
adds them to its collections. NUC Audiovisual Materials is a quarterly micro-
fiche publication distributed by LC. Data needed for the catalog entries come
from producers, manufacturers, film libraries, or distributing agencies. The Na-
tional Audiovisual Center provides information for U.S. government materials.
In most cases cataloging is done from the information thus provided without actual
viewing of the material itself.
</p>
<p>LC also provides information about maps (National Union Catalog&mdash;
Cartographic Materials). This source is good; however, map cataloging tends to
be very slow. It is a quarterly publication issued since 1983 in microfiche. LC
catalogs single-sheet maps, map sets, and atlases.
</p>
<p>The National Register of Microform Masters (Library of Congress, 1965&ndash;1983)
had two basic purposes. One was to provide a complete national register of micro-
form masters from which libraries could acquire prints. The other was to help li-
braries ensure the preservation of our intellectual heritage. The Register covered
both monographs and serials, but not newspapers. It included the holdings of U.S.
libraries, associations, and microform publishers. It is now available as a retro-
spective MARC record database (www.lcweb.loc.gov/cds/mds.html). Microformat
information is now part of NUC Books or in New Serial Titles.
</p>
<p>Guide to Microforms in Print (K. G. Saur) is a two-volume guide to cur-
rently available microforms worldwide. This guide covers all microformat mate-
rials: reel microfilm, micro-opaque cards, microfiche, and ultramicrofiche. The
Guide distinguishes fifteen types of microforms (see Chapter 12 for a discussion
of the importance of these categories). The arrangement is alphabetical; books
appear under the author&rsquo;s name, and journals under the title. Entries give author
and/or title, date of publication in original format, publisher of the microfilm,
and price. A directory of pub1ishers gives addresses and phone numbers.

<p>Electronic Searching and OCLC
</p>
<p>As noted previously, searching electronically is faster and almost always
provides more realistic options for verifying an item than is possible through
print sources. Because OCLC has become a, if not the, major worldwide source
for bibliographic data, we focus here on OCLC searching methods. OCLC&rsquo;s
Quick Reference: Searching for Bibliographic Records provides an overview of
the various searching methods (see Figures 7.3 through 7.6, pages 148&ndash;51).
</p>
<p>Users can employ numeric, derived, title phrase, keyword, and qualifying
searches in WorldCat. Numeric searches are possible for ISBNs and ISSNs. Also
possible are searches by Library of Congress catalog number, music publisher
number, U.S. Superintendent of Documents number, CODEN, and OCLC con-
trol number.
</p>
<p>Derived searches can be by title, personal name (author), corporate name,
or author/title. Title phrase searching allows the searcher to input up to sixty let-
ters, numbers, spaces, or special characters (such as &amp; or %) from a title. Key-
word searching permits up to eight keywords, if the searcher is using the
WorldCat or Harvard databases, and up to eleven words for searches of the
Books in Print, EUR-OP, or NetFirst databases.
</p>
<p>Searching OCLC databases is fast and offers a variety of search options.
However, searchers must remember that each search generates a charge to the li-
brary&rsquo;s account with OCLC. Thus, it is very important to be certain the elements
are correct before striking the &ldquo;send&rdquo; key. A miskeyed entry costs the library just
as much as one that is correct. It is also important to select the search method
most likely to provide a &ldquo;hit&rdquo; (correctly verify the item) on the first attempt. The
fewer searches performed to correctly verify the item, the less it costs the library.
</p>
<p>Following is an example that could be encountered in many types of librar-
ies. The goal is to accurately identify information about the following item:

<p>One reasonable starting approach would be a title search because the re-
quest appears to have a complete, valid title. The results of such a search are il-
lustrated in Figures 7.7a and 7.7b. The problem with the results is clear: There is
a title and publication match but the author does not match. What should the
searcher do? If the requester works in the library or is easy to contact, it would be
wise to check with the person to determine if the search has identified the correct
item before searching further. Doing an author (derived) search for D. Cham-
pagne produced no useful results.

<p>A title phrase search (see Figures 7.8a and 7.8b) produces some interesting
results that might make one question which item the requester really wanted.
There is one &ldquo;hit&rdquo; that matches the two title words and the publication date. Also,
all three deal with the same subject matter.

<p>Although preorder work is often repetitive and perhaps usually easy, it is in
fact critical to the overall performance of the acquisitions department. Staff need
careful training in the methods of searching, the basics of cataloging rules of
entry, and which verification sources are most likely to produce the requisite in-
formation in a timely and accurate manner. Poor preorder searching is costly for
the library and staff in terms of time and money wasted. Verification sources are
constantly changing. New ones appear and old familiar ones (like the Weekly Re-
cord) disappear. They change coverage and arrangement. This means that
searchers must regularly check the front matter of the verification sources to
determine what, if any, changes occurred. With online sources, the log-on screen
often provides this type of information. As any experienced searcher knows,
when there is both a print and an electronic version of a verification source,
searching both formats is essential before deciding an item is not listed.

</p>
<p>As noted in Chapter 7, libraries employ several acquisitions methods. Each
has a useful role to play in developing collections for end-users in an efficient,
cost-effective manner. Today, a majority of libraries use computer-generated or-
ders and store the data electronically, thus reducing the volume of paper associ-
ated with ordering activities. For a few libraries, there is no paper order form for
current trade books, because the libraries handle the entire order process elec-
tronically, storing the transaction in both the library&rsquo;s and the supplier&rsquo;s comput-
ers. In the future, this may be the way all libraries place their orders; however, for
thousands of libraries, the paperless order is not yet a reality.
</p>
<p>A key publication for acquisitions departments is Guidelines for Handling
Library Orders for In-Print Monographic Publications. Prepared by the Book
Dealer&ndash;Library Relations Committee of the Resources and Technical Services
Division of the American Library Association (now called Association for Li-
brary Collections &amp; Technical Services), it reflects the needs of both groups. It
also contains recommendations for establishing and maintaining good working
relationships between vendors and libraries. One suggestion is that libraries use
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Committee Z39 single title
order form, which measures 3 by 5 inches (ca. 8 by 13 cm.), a size that has been
common for years in technical service units.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the method used to order material, the vendor must receive
enough information to ensure shipment of the correct materials: author, title,
publisher, date of publication, price, edition (if there are various editions), num-
ber of copies, order number, and any special instructions regarding invoicing or
methods of payment. Also, more suppliers are asking for the International Stan-
dard Book Number (ISBN) or International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). In
time, International Standard Numbers (ISNs) may be all the library needs to
send, because ISNs are unique numbers representing a specific journal or a spe-
cific edition of a specific title. Other uses of these numbers are in cataloging, data

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>processing, and public service activities, so it is important to understand ISBNs
and how they work.
</p>
<p>One important characteristic of ISBNs is that each edition of a book has a
unique ISBN, as do the paper and hardbound versions. For example, the number
for the first edition of this book was 0-87287-029-4; the second edition was
0-87287-125-8. The number for the hardbound version of the fourth edition was
0-87287-228-9 and for the paperbound, 0-87287-248-3. The number(s) before
the first hyphen represents the country of origin; the next set of numbers is for the
individual publisher; the next set represents the title, edition, and format; and the
last number is the &ldquo;check digit.&rdquo; The last number serves as a way of verifying the
rest of the ISBN.
</p>
<p>From the point of view of some acquisitions departments, the ISBN is the
only information needed to order a book from a jobber because it identifies the
specific edition and binding. Ordering by ISBN could be a major time-saver: no
more keying in of author, title, publisher, place, date, or price. However, mis-
takes might arise from just using the ISBN (e.g., transposed numbers, errors in
copying). If the library provides author, title, and publisher, for example, the job-
ber may be able to provide the desired item despite a typographic error. Never-
theless, we think serious consideration should be given to using only the ISBN.
</p>
<p>The ISBN is one of several ways to search for bibliographic data in an elec-
tronic environment, for example, in the OCLC database. Vendor systems such as
Baker &amp; Taylor&rsquo;s ACQUIRE system use it as the search technique. When one
is searching hundreds of titles a day, saving ten to twenty seconds per search is
important.
</p>
<p>However, acquisitions department staff need to realize that because the
ISBN is unique, it should only be used in conjunction with other search tech-
niques to verify information about a title, not to determine if the library already
has a copy of a particular book. A reprint of a particular title will have a different
ISBN than the original; perhaps the requester does not know that the library al-
ready has the originally published edition. Further, if a book is published simul-
taneously in the United States and in Europe, each edition will have its own
ISBN. Acquisitions department staff should be very careful that one person isn&rsquo;t
ordering a particular book using the U.S. ISBN when another has just ordered the
same title using the British or Canadian ISBN.
</p>
<p>An article by Audrey Eaglen outlines several additional issues related to
using ISBNs.1 First, she notes that publishers sometimes use the number for in-
ventory control, getting a new number for each reprinting of the title and using
the number to track the number of copies sold from that print run. Second, pub-
lishers only give part of the ISBN, usually the third element (title/edition) in their
ads and promotional literature. A third problem she noted is that review media,
when they include ISBNs, often do not list the correct number. She states that,
&ldquo;Approximately ten percent of the ISBNs given in its (PW) &lsquo;Forecasts&rsquo; reviews
are simply incorrect.&rdquo; These problems, combined with the fact that a book pub-
lished in both cloth and paperback formats by different publishers in the United
States and the United Kingdom can have four different ISBNs, illustrate the limi-
tations of the system.
</p>
<p>158 8&mdash;Order Processes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Library of Congress is investigating the problems and advantages of
replacing LC control numbers with ISBNs. The British Library has already made
this switch, and BNB catalog cards are now ordered using the ISBN. Using the
ISBN in accounting activities could reduce typing required because invoices
could use only the ISBN even if the order form provides additional information.
This would save some effort for both suppliers and libraries.
</p>
<p>The International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is an eight-digit number
that identifies the publisher and title for periodicals. As with the ISBN, the last
digit serves as the control. ISBNs and ISSNs were both developed in the expecta-
tion of extensive computer use in book distribution.
</p>
<p>At present, there is no equivalent standard for electronic order transmis-
sion; however, ANSI Committee Z39 is working on such a standard, &ldquo;Computer-
ized Book Ordering Standard.&rdquo; As of June 2001, the standard was still under
development.
</p>
<p>Another standard of ANSI Committee Z39 is the Standard Address Num-
ber (SAN). Like the ISBN, the SAN is a unique number (of seven digits) that
identifies each address or organization doing business in the U.S. and Canadian
book trade. For example, the SAN of the Charles Von der Ahe Library at Loyola
Marymount University is 332-9135, Brodart is 159-9984, Libraries Unlimited is
202-6767, and Thomas Allen &amp; Son is 115-1762. Perhaps eventually all that will
be necessary to order a title electronically will be three sets of unique numbers:
the ISBN or ISSN and the SANs for the supplier and the buyer. Again, such sim-
plified ordering is some time in the future, if it ever becomes a reality. Neverthe-
less, these unique numbers are useful as a cross-check for accuracy. Keys to
SANs appear in a variety of sources, such as the American Library Directory,
which includes library SANs in its entries.
</p>
<p>With a manual system, libraries commonly use a multiple-copy order form
for placing orders. (Almost any computer-based acquisition system handles all
of the following tasks with little or no paper.) These forms are available in a
number of formats and contain from four to as many as twelve copies. The
3-by-5-inch (ca 8-by-13-cm.) size is standard in North America. Normally, each
copy is a different color for easy identification. There is no standard dictating a
specific color for a particular purpose. A minimum of four copies is typical: (1)
outstanding order copy, (2) dealer&rsquo;s copy, (3) claiming copy, and (4) accounting
copy. Only the staff&rsquo;s imagination limits the number of potential uses of addi-
tional copies. A few libraries still use all twelve copies. Some libraries mail two
copies to the dealer and keep three or four in the in-process file. In some larger
systems, where selectors are not in close contact with the acquisitions depart-
ment (as in research libraries, where faculty members do much of the selecting),
an information copy goes to the selector. (Figure 8.1, page 160, and Figure 8.2,
page 161, illustrate order forms.)

</p>
<p>The in-process file may contain several copies of the order form. For exam-
ple, after sending the order, the staff might place five copies in the in-process
file. One copy represents on-order status; two are available for use for possible
claims; one is forwarded to cataloging with the item when it arrives; and the final
one remains in the file, indicating that the item is being processed but is not yet
ready for public use. Upon receipt, a staff member pulls all slips except the
in-process slip. When the item is ready for circulation, the cataloging department
returns a slip to acquisitions to prompt the removal of the in-process slip. Pre-
sumably at this point a set of entries is in the public catalog indicating that the
item is available for use.

<p>Claiming and handling supplier reports is one of the more time-consuming
and frustrating aspects of the order function. Most multiple-copy order forms
have slips for these purposes. Purchasers have every reason to expect U.S. com-
mercial publishers, or vendors supplying titles from such publishers, to deliver
or report on the status of the order within 90 days, if there is some delay in filling
the order. For American noncommercial publishers (for example, university
presses or professional associations), an additional 30 days (120 days total) is
common for delivery or a report. Western European titles delivered to the United
States normally require 180 days, and a year or more is not uncommon for items
from countries with a developing book trade. This estimate of delivery times is
</p>
<p>8&mdash;Order Processes 161</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>similar for Canada, with the added note that shipments of books from the United
States must cross a border. This always takes more time than shipments within
Canada. When there is an active collecting program from developing countries,
libraries must expect a certain percentage of nonresponses. Learning how long to
wait for delivery or a status report comes with experience with various dealers
and countries.
</p>
<p>When dealing with U.S. publishers, allowing for the normal two-way &ldquo;snail
mail&rdquo; time, it is reasonable to send a second claim in 60 days after the first claim,
if there has been no status report. Many order forms have a printed note stating
&ldquo;cancel after x days.&rdquo; Although such statements are legally binding, most librar-
ies send a separate cancellation notice. (Note: The order slip is in fact a legal con-
tract committing the library to pay for the item upon delivery.) Cancellation
should not take place until after the normal response time passes, unless there are
unusual circumstances, such as an unexpected budget reduction. Unfortunately,
over the past twenty years many such cuts have taken place, and most vendors
have been cooperative about making the adjustments. By establishing a regular
cancellation date, libraries that must expend funds within a period of time (usu-
ally twelve months) can avoid or reduce the last-minute scramble of canceling
outstanding orders and ordering materials that the vendor can deliver in time to
expend the funds. (Budgets, timeframes, accounting, and expenditures are ex-
plored in greater detail in Chapter 14.)
</p>
<p>Vendors should respond with a meaningful report when they cannot fill an
order within a reasonable period. One less-than-helpful report that vendors did
and occasionally still do use is &ldquo;temporarily out of stock&rdquo; (TOS). How long is
&ldquo;temporarily?&rdquo; What has the vendor done to secure the item? Poor or inaccurate
reporting costs the library money, as Audrey Eaglen pointed out in &ldquo;Trouble in
Kiddyland: The Hidden Costs of O.P. and O.S.&rdquo;2 In periods of rapid inflation,
each day the funds remain committed but unexpended erodes buying power
because producers and suppliers raise prices without notice. Recommended ven-
dor reports are &ldquo;not yet received from publisher&rdquo; (NYR); &ldquo;out-of-stock, order-
ing&rdquo; (OS, ordering); &ldquo;claiming&rdquo;; &ldquo;canceled&rdquo;; &ldquo;not yet published&rdquo; (NYP);
&ldquo;out-of-stock, publisher&rdquo; (OS, publisher); &ldquo;out-of-print&rdquo; (OP); &ldquo;publication can-
celed&rdquo;; &ldquo;out-of-stock indefinitely&rdquo; (treat this one as a cancellation); &ldquo;not our
publication&rdquo; (NOP); &ldquo;wrong title supplied&rdquo;; &ldquo;defective copy&rdquo;; and &ldquo;wrong quan-
tity supplied.&rdquo; After staff members learn how long a vendor takes to supply items
first reported in the recommended manner, it is possible to make an informed
decision regarding when to cancel and when to wait for delivery.
</p>
<p>Before placing an order, the staff must make three important decisions:
</p>
<p>1. Which acquisition method to use.
</p>
<p>2. What vendor to use.
</p>
<p>3. What funding source to use.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter explores the methods of acquiring materials.
Chapter 9 discusses vendors: when and how to use them and what to expect from
them. Chapter 14 covers the fiscal side of acquisitions work.

�&amp;'�
</p>
<p>Acquisitions departments, whether merged with serials or not, acquire
materials using several methods, each having somewhat different processing.
Essentially there are eight standard methods of acquisition&mdash;firm order, standing
order, approval plans, blanket order, subscriptions (for serials departments),
leases (increasing in use), gifts, and exchange programs. A firm order (for exam-
ple, orders in which desired items are individually named) is the usual method
for acquiring many titles that the library knows it wants. For most current items,
the firm order is the only logical method to use. It is often the best method for the
first volume in a series, even if the selectors are thinking about ordering all the
items in the series. Ordering directly from the individual producers takes sub-
stantially more time than placing an order for a number of titles, from different
producers, with a jobber/wholesaler. The major drawback of this method is the
time it takes to prepare the individual orders.
</p>
<p>Standing orders (for example, open orders for all titles fitting a particular
category) work best for items that are somewhat serial in nature. That is, they ap-
pear on an irregular basis or as an annual or other predictable time frame. Some
examples are a numbered or unnumbered series from a publisher that deal with a
single subject area. The library places the order for the series/items rather like it
places a journal subscription. The supplier (vendor or producer) automatically
sends the items as they appear along with an invoice. There is a distinction be-
tween &ldquo;thinking about&rdquo; and &ldquo;planning on&rdquo; when considering series items. When
the selector knows that the reputation of the publisher or editor of the series is
sound, it is probably best to place a standing order. If the library knows it wants
all the items, then a standing order will save staff time and effort due to the auto-
matic shipments. However, especially in academic libraries, standing orders are
often the result of one person&rsquo;s request, and if the library does not periodically
review its standing orders it may find that the requester left the institution years
before or no longer has an interest in the series subject. The result is money spent
on less useful items. If there is some question about suitability or content of the
series, a firm order or approval copy order for the first volume is the better
choice. Not all &ldquo;publishers series&rdquo; are in fact quality titles and in some cases they
are almost, if not in fact, fraudulent. For example, in 1993 there were a number of
e-mail messages on one of the collection development discussion lists regarding
an article in Lingua Franca about a publisher that appears to be a vanity house
but markets books as part of a series.3 (Remember that vanity publishers simply
publish any person&rsquo;s book as the individual pays for the work.) Getting to know
publishers and editors is an important activity for acquisitions department staff.
</p>
<p>The greatest drawback to standing orders is their unpredictable nature in
terms of both number and cost. Certainly there is no problem about numbers for
the regular series, but their cost per item may vary. When it comes to publishers&rsquo;
series or irregular series, a library may go several years without receiving a title,
then receive several in one year. This is one of the areas where Joyce Ogburn&rsquo;s
prediction skills come into play,4 as one must &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; how much money to
set aside at the start of the budget year to cover standing order expenses. Looking
at past experience and using an average amount is a safe approach; however, the
</p>
<p>Acquisition Methods 163</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>library is seldom able to set aside exactly the right amount. Committing (encum-
bering) too much money for too long may result in lost opportunities to acquire
other useful items. Committing too little can result in having invoices arrive and
not having the funds available to pay them. Standing orders are a valuable acqui-
sition method, but one that requires careful monitoring throughout the year.
</p>
<p>Approval plans are, in a sense, a variation of the standing order concept.
They involve automatic shipment of items to the library from a vendor along
with automatic invoicing, after the library accepts the item. The differences are
that the approval plan normally covers a number of subject areas and the library
has the right to return items it does not want. Approval plans are usually avail-
able from book jobbers such as Yankee Book Peddler, Academic Book Center,
and Coutts. Saving staff time and effort is one of the major advantages of such
plans. Another advantage is the right to return unwanted items; the underlying
assumption is that collection development staff can make better decisions about
an item&rsquo;s appropriateness by looking at the item before committing to its pur-
chase. However, there is research evidence that indicates the approval plan can
result in a substantially higher number of very low or no-use items being added
to the collection.5
</p>
<p>The key element in making the approval plan a cost-effective acquisition
method is in developing a sound &ldquo;profile&rdquo; with the plan vendor. A profile out-
lines the parameters of the plan and covers issues such as subjects wanted, levels
of treatment (undergraduate, graduate, etc.), countries covered, no reprints, no
collections of reprinted articles, and so forth. The greater the time spent in pre-
paring the profile, as well as monitoring the actual operation of the plan and mak-
ing adjustments, the greater the value of an approval plan to the library and the
acquisitions unit. The monitoring of operations and actually reviewing the item
is also an obvious key to success. Given today&rsquo;s staffing situation in most librar-
ies, there is a real danger that the plan will shift from approval to blanket order,
simply because the staff has to attend to more pressing duties.
</p>
<p>A blanket order is a combination of a firm order and an approval plan. It is a
commitment on the library&rsquo;s part to purchase all of something, usually the output
of a publisher, or a limited subject area, or from a country. In the case of a subject
area or country, there is a profile developed between the library and the blanket
order vendor. The materials arrive automatically along with the invoice, thus
saving staff time. Another advantage, for country blanket order plans, is that they
ensure the library acquires a copy of a limited print run title. (It is not uncommon
to have very limited print runs of scholarly items in most countries. Waiting for
an announcement or a listing in a national bibliography may mean that there are
no copies available to purchase.) Like the standing order, the major drawback of
blanket order plans is predicting how much money the library will need to re-
serve to cover the invoices. There is even less predictability with blanket order
plans because there are more variables.
</p>
<p>Subscriptions, for journals, newspapers, and many other serials, are a
combination of standing and blanket orders. A library may enter a subscription
for a given time frame just as an individual does for personal magazines. How-
ever, rather than going through an annual renewal process, many libraries enter
into an agreement with a serials vendor to automatically renew subscriptions
</p>
<p>164 8&mdash;Order Processes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>until the library requests a cancellation (&ldquo; &rsquo;til forbidden&rdquo;). Doing this saves both
the library and vendor staff time and paperwork. This is a cost-effective system
for those titles the library is certain are of long-term interest to end-users.
</p>
<p>Leases are now commonplace for handling electronic resources, especially
those that are Web-based. Even many of the reference CD-ROM products that
are frequently updated are essentially leased&mdash;the library is supposed to return or
destroy the disc when an updated disc arrives or when it cancels the subscription.
The decision to lease is almost always in the hands of the supplier rather than the
library, although sometimes a library can &ldquo;buy&rdquo; the product, usually at a substan-
tially higher price. The difference between buying and leasing has significant
implications for the library and its users. Essentially the library pays for access to
the information for as long as it pays the annual fee. At the end of a lease the li-
brary generally loses all access to the material it was paying for, although some
suppliers will provide long-term access to the material that was available during
the time the lease was in force. Chapter 11 provides more information about this
and other issues related to electronic resources.
</p>
<p>Usually, acquisitions departments are the ultimate recipients of unsolicited
gifts of books, serials, and other materials (sometimes accompanied by a variety
of molds and insects) that well-meaning people give to the library. Both solicited
and unsolicited gifts can be a source of out-of-print materials for replacement,
extra copies, and the filling of gaps in the collection. The collection development
policy statement on gifts will help acquisitions personnel process the material
quickly. A good article outlining all aspects of handling gifts is Mary Bostic&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Gifts to Libraries: Coping Effectively.&rdquo;6 Another excellent survey of both gift
and exchange programs is by Steven Carrico7; it covers all management aspects
of the work.
</p>
<p>Reviewing gifts is important, as a library cannot afford to discard valuable
or needed items that arrive as gifts. However, the library must keep in mind the
fact that it should not add unnecessary items just because they were &ldquo;free.&rdquo; Pro-
cessing and storage costs are the same for a gift as for a purchased item. Older
books require careful checking, as variations in printings and editions may deter-
mine whether an item is valuable or worthless. (Usually, a second or third print-
ing is less valuable than the first printing of a work.) Persons with extensive
training and experience in bibliographic checking must do the searching.
</p>
<p>Steven Carrico provides an excellent summary of the advantages and disad-
vantages of gift programs:
</p>
<p>Positive Points of Gifts
</p>
<p>1. Gifts can replace worn and missing items in a library.
</p>
<p>2. Out-of-print desiderata often surface from gift donations.
</p>
<p>3. Gifts can foster communication and goodwill in a library
community.
</p>
<p>Acquisition Methods 165</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4. Gifts may become heavily used or important research ad-
ditions to a collection.
</p>
<p>5. Some titles that are not available by purchase are avail-
able as gifts.
</p>
<p>6. Worthwhile gift material not selected for a library collec-
tion can be put in a book sale, sold to dealers, or given away to
underfunded libraries and institutions.
</p>
<p>Negative Points
</p>
<p>1. Gifts require staff time and are costly to process.
</p>
<p>2. Dealing with even well meaning gift donors is frequently
an aggravation to staff.
</p>
<p>3. Gifts take up precious space in a library.
</p>
<p>4. Many collection managers give gifts low priority, so they
may sit on review shelves for a long time.
</p>
<p>5. A large percentage of most gifts are not added to a collec-
tion, which creates disposal problems.
</p>
<p>6. Overall, since most gift books added to a collection are
older editions, they will be less frequently used by library
patrons.8
</p>
<p>There are some legal aspects about gifts, at least in the United States, that
staff must understand. One IRS regulation relevant to libraries has to do with
gifts and donations to a library or not-for-profit information center. Any library,
or its parent institution, that receives a gift in-kind (books, journals, manuscripts,
and so forth) with an appraised value of $5,000 or more must report the gift to the
IRS. A second regulation forbids the receiving party (in this case the library)
from providing an estimated value for the gift in-kind. A disinterested party or
organization must make the valuation. The latter requirement grew out of con-
cern that recipients were placing unrealistically high values on gifts. The donor
received a larger tax deduction than was warranted, and it did not cost the receiv-
ing organization anything to place a high value on the gift. Normally, an ap-
praiser charges a fee for valuing gifts, and the donor is supposed to pay the fee.
Most often, the appraisers are antiquarian dealers who charge a flat fee for the
service unless the collection is large or complex. If the appraisal is complex, the
appraiser either charges a percentage of the appraised value or an hourly fee.
</p>
<p>Typically, with gifts thought to be worth less than $4,999, the library may
write a letter of acknowledgment indicating the number and type of items re-
ceived. For gifts of less than $250, the IRS does not require a letter. The donor
</p>
<p>166 8&mdash;Order Processes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>can set a value on the gift for tax purposes. (The best practice is to provide a letter
for any accepted gift.) If asked, the library can provide dealer catalogs for the
donors to see retail prices for items similar to their donation. However, the final
value of the gift is established by the donor and his or her tax accountant.
</p>
<p>Just because the gift is small in number of items does not mean that the fair
market value is below $5,000. Recently, Loyola Marymount University (LMU)
received a gift of 483 books about Japanese art, architecture, and landscape
design; its appraised value was $39,743. The donor might well have accepted a
letter simply stating the number of books given and thus have lost a substantial
tax deduction.
</p>
<p>To meet IRS requirements, a letter must contain the library&rsquo;s name, the date
of the contribution, the location/place of the gift (even if it is the library), and a
description of the gift. At a minimum that description should provide number
and kind of gift (for example, 100 mass-market paperbacks, 40 hardcover books,
six complete and unbound volumes of National Geographic). More information
regarding these regulations can be found in the IRS publications Charitable
Contributions (IRS Publication #526) and Charitable Contributions&mdash;Substanti-
ation and Disclosure (IRS Publication #1771). Both are available online at
http://www.irs.gov/prod/forms_pubs/pubs.html.
</p>
<p>Deciding to use the gift or deposit method of acquisition will almost always
result in a long delay in receiving the desired item. Verification may establish
that the item is a government publication that may be part of the library&rsquo;s deposi-
tory program, or it may be a new government series that should become part of
the program. In either case, the acquisitions staff would not issue a firm order but
would notify the requester so that he or she can decide what to do.
</p>
<p>Donations and gifts also present an acquisitions option that can be appropri-
ate at times. Sometimes a library user or board member donates certain materials
on a regular basis, making it unnecessary to order the item if there is no immedi-
ate demand for the material. Occasionally, an appropriate series or set costs so
much a library cannot buy it with regular funding sources. Seeking out a donor to
assist with funding or to pay for the purchase is not unheard of, but again, there
may be substantial delays in acquiring the item. Most often, this takes place with
rare books and special collections items. An active (and well-to-do) Friends of
the Library group may be the answer to a special purchase situation. Friends
groups, used judiciously, can significantly expand the collection and stretch
funds.
</p>
<p>One final acquisition category is the exchange method. There are two basic
types of exchange activity: the exchange of unwanted duplicate or gift materials
and the exchange of new materials between libraries. Usually, only large re-
search libraries engage in exchange of new materials. In essence, cooperating
institutions trade institutional publications. Tozzer Library (Harvard University&rsquo;s
anthropology library) has exchange agreements with several hundred organiza-
tions. These organizations send their publications to Tozzer, which, in turn,
sends them Peabody Museum publications. Often, this method is the only way a
library can acquire an organization&rsquo;s publications, especially from countries
with a developing book trade.
</p>
<p>Acquisition Methods 167</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Occasionally, libraries use this system to acquire materials from countries
in which there are commercial trade restrictions. Where government trade re-
strictions make buying and selling of publications from certain countries diffi-
cult or impossible, the cooperating libraries acquire (buy) their local
publications for exchange. Exchanges of this type are complex and difficult to
manage, and this is a method of last resort. Libraries can exercise better quality
control when they trade for known organizational series or titles than when the
choice of publications from the organization is more or less left to chance.
Exchanges of this type exist on the basis of formal agreements between the co-
operating organizations. They play an important role in developing compre-
hensive subject collections.
</p>
<p>The Canadian Book Exchange Centre (CBEC), a service operated by the
National Library of Canada, is a redistribution center and a clearinghouse for the
exchange of materials in all formats between libraries. The service is free; partic-
ipating libraries must pay shipping charges. Individuals can donate items to the
Centre but cannot receive items in exchange. Details about CBEC&rsquo;s activities
can be found at www.nlc-bnc.ca/6/10/index-e.html.
</p>
<p>Libraries normally add only a small percentage of unsolicited gifts to the
collection. This means the library must dispose of many unwanted items. In
some libraries, a separate unit handles unneeded material; this unit usually is
called the exchange unit. In most cases, it is the gift unit that handles the disposal
work.
</p>
<p>Disposition of unwanted gift materials is an activity that almost every library
engages in at some time. One method is to list the unwanted items and mail the
list to exchange units in other libraries, and the first library to request an item gets
it for the shipping cost (usually book rate postage). This method is time-consuming
as well as taking up scarce shelf space in many libraries. Another method is to
arrange with an out-of-print dealer to take the items, usually as a lot rather than
for a per-item price. It is unusual to receive cash; instead, the dealer gives the li-
brary a line of credit. The library uses the credit to acquire materials from the
dealer. This system works well when the library has specialized materials the
dealer wants and when the dealer stocks enough useful material so that the li-
brary can use its credit within a reasonable time (eighteen to twenty-four
months). Holding a book sale is yet another method of disposing of unwanted
material, one that is gaining in popularity as dealers resist the credit memo sys-
tem. However, this is not a &ldquo;free&rdquo; venture, as staff must select the items for sale,
establish a fair price, find a suitable location, and monitor the sale. Depending on
the volume of gifts, annual, semiannual, or monthly sales are appropriate. Sales
can be an excellent Friends of the Library project that can save some staff time. A
few libraries use an ongoing sale tactic, especially when they have limited staff
and space and a high volume of unwanted gifts. There is a Web site devoted to
listing book sales (http://www.book-sales-in-america.com).

</p>
<p>After selecting an acquisition method, the next step in the order process is
to select a vendor. Chapter 9 addresses issues of dealer and vendor selection as
well as what they can and cannot do for a library. Once a vendor has been selected,
order placement may begin. In this step, a staff member assigns an order number
and determines which fund to use for payment. Order numbers are essential for
the staff to track orders after they are placed. The assignment process is simply a
matter of checking the last order number and using the next number in the sequence.
As soon as the department head signs the orders, they are ready for mailing.
</p>
<p>Receiving orders, although not difficult, requires careful planning. If not
handled properly, receiving can be more costly and time-consuming than order-
ing. As strange as it may seem, proper unpacking of shipments will save every-
one in the department a great deal of time, energy, and frustration. Finding the
packing slip or invoice is the key first step in the process. A packing slip lists, at
least in most cases, all the items in a particular shipment. An invoice is an item-
ized bill, which business offices require before they will issue a voucher or
check. For receiving convenience, most vendors attach a clearly marked enve-
lope containing the packing slip to the outside of one of the boxes. Unfortu-
nately, a few vendors seem to delight in hiding the slip in strange places. One
technique is to enclose the slip inside one of the items, and another favorite hid-
ing place is under a cardboard liner on the bottom of the box. If no packing slip is
found, it is essential to keep the items separated from other materials in the re-
ceiving area. Mixing shipments can create endless problems.
</p>
<p>A second important step is to check each item against the packing slip as it
comes out of the box. This serves as a check on what the shippers think they sent
against what the library actually received. After all, boxes go astray in shipment,
shipping room clerks overlook items or add something not on the order, and
sometimes items disappear from the library before processing.
</p>
<p>Checking the physical condition of each item is another step in the receiv-
ing process. Defective materials may be returned for credit or replacement with-
out prior approval from the vendor. Imperfections can be of many kinds. With
books, typical problems are missing or blank pages or improperly collated texts.
Staff members need to check audiotapes and videotapes for gaps, blank or
fogged sections, and proper recording speed. Microforms need to be examined to
assure the producer processed them properly; sometimes they have fogged,
streaked, or spotted areas, and occasionally there is chemical residue that can
ruin the film. The following list highlights some common receipt problems:
</p>
<p>&bull; The wrong edition sent. (Note that the checker must be aware of the dif-
ference between an edition and a printing. A new edition means there are
substantial changes&mdash;material added or deleted; a new printing merely
indicates the publisher sold out the previous printing and reprinted more
copies with no changes in the text.)

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Too many or not enough copies sent.
</p>
<p>&bull; Imperfect copies received.
</p>
<p>Vendors are usually good about accepting returns of unwanted items, even when
it turns out to have been the fault of the library&mdash;as long as the library has not put
its property mark in them.
</p>
<p>After determining that the shipment is complete, property marking (such as
stamping or embossing) takes place. As noted above, sometimes items disap-
pear, so the sooner property marking takes place the more difficult it will be for
materials to vanish without a trace. Property marking takes many forms.
Stamping the fore edge and the title page of books is a common practice. (Rare
books are handled differently.) Another method is to accession items, that is, to
give each item a unique number. A staff member records the number and title of
the item in an accessions book. Today, linking the bar code in an item to its item
record in a database accomplishes the same type of inventory control with much
less effort.
</p>
<p>Special leaders attached to films and microforms provide both &ldquo;eye legible&rdquo;
information about the content and an indication of library ownership. Microfilm
and film reels may be large enough to take a bar code label, but microfiches
seldom carry ownership markings. Sound discs, which are disappearing from
collections as audiocassettes and CDs replace them, usually have a stamp on the
record label as well as on the record jacket. Cassette items often have bar code
labels attached or the library&rsquo;s name and the accession number engraved on the
cassette.
</p>
<p>��������(�&amp;������%
</p>
<p>Previously we mentioned the importance and complex nature of serials.
Control of incoming serials is a key factor in the library&rsquo;s realizing the maximum
value for its investment in subscriptions.
</p>
<p>End-users and librarians often want to know the library&rsquo;s exact holdings for
a single title. Are some items missing? What is the latest issue? When did the li-
brary pay for the subscription? How often does the library bind the issues? What
is the publication&rsquo;s format? Where can the library subscribe to a particular peri-
odical? Most libraries maintain files that answer all these questions and many
more. But without careful attention to the number of files being generated and
maintained, the paperwork can become overwhelming. Even an automated sys-
tem requires that someone input the appropriate data. Too often, files contain
needless duplication, which means wasting staff time in updating files.
</p>
<p>Most librarians agree that serials control constitutes one of the major re-
cord-keeping headaches in technical services. The basic controlling method is to
maintain a unit control record for each title. This can be a page in a notebook, a
3-by-5-inch (ca 8-by-13-cm) card file, a card in a visible file (see Figures 8.3
through 8.5, pages 171&ndash;72), or a computer record (see Figure 8.6, page 173). A
single record should contain all information for a given title, such as when
the subscription began, its acquisition source, renewal frequency, and binding
</p>
<p>170 8&mdash;Order Processes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>information. As files grow, it becomes exceedingly difficult to extract the
desired information quickly. With a centralized manual record system for each
title, the library can only arrange the records by one element of information, nor-
mally alphabetically by title. The alternative is to set up several files to counter-
act the limited access of a central file. However, then the library faces all the
disadvantages of a decentralized record system, such as a growing number of
files to maintain, duplication of information, and increased searching time for
users and library staff.

<p>Electronic Serials Processing
</p>
<p>E-serials are an example of how technology changes the process of acquisi-
tions. An excellent article by Ellen Duranceau spells out the differences between
print and electronic serials acquisitions.9 Her major points are that more team-
work is required, more higher level personnel are involved, it takes more time
because it is not a linear process (in most cases), and it requires input from legal
and technical staff that may not be part of the library staff. Further, she noted that
the concept of &ldquo; &rsquo;til forbidden&rdquo; does not work well for e-serials as producers and
aggregators change the &ldquo;product&rdquo; all the time&mdash;even during a subscription period.
</p>
<p>Check-In Routines
</p>
<p>The most critical aspect of serials work is the daily checking in of periodi-
cals,serials, and newspapers. This is the point at which the system can succeed or
fail. The staff must rigorously follow the established routines. When a library
loses a single issue of a serial, it may have to spend four or five times the cover
price to secure a replacement copy, delay binding a volume, or risk creating a gap
in the collection.
</p>
<p>Each library must make a decision on how to set up the check-in file. With
manual files there are two basic arrangement choices: by the official catalog
(main) entry or by the title as it appears on the issue&rsquo;s cover. When the library&rsquo;s
subscription list consists of popular commercial magazines such as Time or
Good Housekeeping, either approach is fine. However, as the list grows, cover
titles and catalog entry forms will diverge. The problem, of course, is that the
person at the check-in file has only the particular issue in hand. Even for a fully
trained and capable cataloger, examining the issue to determine the main entry in
order to locate the check-in record is very time consuming. Publications that
have cover titles such as Journal of . . . or Bulletin of . . . are likely to have a cor-
porate entry; when one adds journals in other languages, the problem is com-
pounded. A library is fortunate if it has check-in staff who are capable of reading
more than one or two languages.
</p>
<p>Another problem is how to set up the record for a new subscription. With
the cover-title method the check-in person can set up the record when the first
issue arrives. The main-entry approach requires that the catalog department pro-
vide full cataloging information before establishing the check-in record. Depending
on publication frequency and the catalog department&rsquo;s workload, additional
issues may arrive before the check-in record exists. This may cause some confu-
sion and perhaps lead to issues being lost.
</p>
<p>Because of these problems, most libraries with manual files use the
cover-title approach in a visible file system. This approach is advantageous be-
cause less time is needed to train checkers, and they make fewer errors. Certainly
one advantage of automated serials control (check-in) modules is the ability to
use a variety of approaches to bring up the proper check-in record. Figure 8.7,
page 175, and Figure 8.8, page 176, illustrate an OPAC public serials screen and
one type of manual system for public access. Note the difference in detail pro-
vided in the staff records and those for the public.
</p>
<p>174 8&mdash;Order Processes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Upon receipt of the daily mail, the staff arranges the items in alphabetical
order by title. A checker cannot assume that the issue in hand is the next issue
due to arrive. The staff member checks the table of contents or legal notice to de-
termine the volume number, issue number, and date of the particular issue in
hand. If there is a gap in the receipts, the claiming process should begin immedi-
ately. Because serials publishers seldom print many copies of an issue beyond
the number of active subscriptions, the claim for a missing issue should go out
quickly if the library hopes to receive a replacement copy.
</p>
<p>The last step in processing is approving the invoice for payment. Normally,
this requires the signature of the head of the department or that person&rsquo;s repre-
sentative. Usually, only a completely filled order may be approved for payment.
The library bookkeeper passes on the approved invoice to the agency that actu-
ally issues the check. Rarely does a library itself write such checks; it is done by
the governing agency.

<p>Before books and other individually ordered items leave the acquisitions
department, the on-order file records need updating or pulling. The follow-up
work on receipt procedures&mdash;for example, preparing letters regarding items not
received, duplicate copies, or errors in invoicing and checking on vendors&rsquo; re-
sponses to inquiries&mdash;accounts for much of the acquisitions department&rsquo;s time.
</p>

</p>
<p>This chapter covers the basics of ordering and receiving materials, high-
lighting the fact that not all acquisitions activities relate to buying materials.
Although the different formats have their special characteristics, the underly-
ing steps are the same regardless of format&mdash;print, electronic, or nonbook me-
dia. There are also a surprising number of legal issues involved in acquisitions
work. For example, a firm order slip is a contract, electronic products come
with contracts and lease forms, and even gifts may have legal implications.
Technology is helping acquisitions staff keep up with an ever-increasing vol-
ume of work; however, at the end of the day it is still the individuals who take
the time to really understand the information trade that make the process work
as well as it does.

<p>Chapter
</p>
<p>������ ������

!������
</p>
<p>The rather simple statement in the previous chapter, &ldquo;select the vendor,&rdquo;
does not do justice to the importance and complexities of the issues associated
with making that selection. This chapter explores the issues involved in making
the decision to go with a specific vendor. Acquisitions departments have two ba-
sic means of purchasing materials, directly from the publisher or producer or
through an intermediary such as a wholesaler or jobber or a retail outlet. The
publishers and producers in some cases require direct purchases and in other
cases require the use of an intermediary source. Often direct purchases will pro-
vide the highest discount, which is good for the collection budget as long as the
acquisitions department has staff enough to handle hundreds of individual or-
ders and invoices. The more typical source is the intermediary (jobber or whole-
saler or retail outlet, for example). Although the discount will be lower than that
offered by a publisher or producer directly, the advantage of placing one order
with an intermediary for titles from hundreds of publishers or producers and re-
ducing the library&rsquo;s paperwork more than compensates for the lower discount.
Because publishers and producers were discussed in detail in Chapter 6, space is
devoted here to discussing two types of intermediary suppliers.
</p>
<p>1&amp;##���
</p>
<p>The most commonly used intermediary source is the jobber or wholesaler.
These organizations carry large inventories of titles from thousands of publishers
and producers. Three of the larger U.S. library book jobbers are Baker &amp; Taylor,
Blackwell North America, and Brodart. Two of the larger Canadian book whole-
salers are National Book Service and United Library Supply. Two of the largest
U.S. serials jobbers are EBSCO and Faxon. In addition, there are smaller firms
that provide good-quality service to libraries and information centers. However,
as discussed below, their numbers are decreasing. Most countries with an active
</p>
<p>181
</p>
<p>	</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>book trade have similar organizations. Libraries often use a jobber in countries
where they buy large quantities of materials. As a general rule a jobber in the
country of origin has a better chance of locating a desired item than does a jobber
from another country.
</p>
<p>Like all other organizations involved in the information business, library
vendors and distributors are facing a changing environment, in large measure
due to technology. Another factor is what has and is happening to the majority of
libraries. That is, the past twenty years or so have not been the best of times for li-
brary funding and support in general. As a result of wanting to continue to do
business with libraries as well as taking advantage of new business opportuni-
ties, many vendors and suppliers are offering a wider range of services to librar-
ies. This is one of the sources for libraries to consider outsourcing some of their
traditional in-house activities.
</p>
<p>Chapter 6 identified two major problems for materials producers: econom-
ics and distribution. Having knowledge of the information product distribution
system is essential for developing the most cost-effective collection of informa-
tion materials. Wholesalers, retailers, and remainder houses are major sources of
material for the library collection. Often, several different sources can supply the
same item. Is there an important difference between these sources? What ser-
vices does each provide? For example, if a library is looking for a book published
last year, it is possible to acquire a copy from various sources. Would it matter
which source is used? How likely is it that all would have the book? For that mat-
ter, what function does each source perform?
</p>
<p>Jobber or Wholesaler?
</p>
<p>Librarians in the United States refer to jobbers or vendors rather than
wholesalers, whereas many Canadian firms are known as wholesalers. There is a
technical difference between a wholesaler and a jobber,1 but for libraries that dif-
ference is insignificant. Jobbers purchase quantities of books from various pub-
lishers, then sell the copies to bookstores and libraries. Because they buy in
volume, they receive a substantial discount from publishers. When the jobber
sells a book, the purchaser receives a discount off the producer&rsquo;s list price, but it
is much lower than the discount that the jobber received. For example, if the job-
ber received a 40 percent discount from the producer, the discount given the
library will be 15 to 20 percent. If the library or bookstore orders the book
directly from the publisher, the discount may be just as high as the jobber re-
ceived or even higher.
</p>
<p>Discounting is a complex issue in any commercial activity, and it is highly
complex in the book trade. Every producer has a discount schedule that is
slightly different, if not unique. Some items are net (no discount); usually these
are textbooks, STM titles, or items of limited sales appeal. Short discounts are
normally 20 percent; these are items the producers expect will have limited appeal
but that have more potential than the net titles. Trade discounts range from 30 to
60 percent or more; items in this category are high-demand items or high-risk
popular fiction. Publishers believe that by giving a high discount for fiction,
bookstores will stock more copies and thus help promote the title. Jobbers normally
</p>
<p>182 9&mdash;Distributors and Vendors</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>receive 40 to 50 percent discounts, primarily because of their high-volume orders
(hundreds of copies per title rather than the tens that most libraries and independent
bookstore owners order).
</p>
<p>Recently, jobbers have encountered financial problems in the form of rising
costs and declining sales. A number of publishers are requiring prepayment or
have placed jobbers on a pro forma status. Pro forma status requires prepayment,
and suppliers extend credit on the basis of the current performance in payment of
bills. Much of the credit and order fulfillment extended by publishers depends on
an almost personal relationship with a jobber. This means that libraries must se-
lect a jobber(s) with care. It is not inappropriate to check a prospective jobber&rsquo;s
financial status (through a rating service, such as Dun and Bradstreet).
</p>
<p>One question for the library to answer is how many vendors to use. There
are pros and cons for consolidating business with only one or two vendors just as
there are for using a number of vendors for the same type of product. Consolida-
tion usually means the vendor gains a better sense of the library&rsquo;s requirements,
perhaps provides a better discount, and may even offer some &ldquo;free&rdquo; services. The
primary danger is the vendor&rsquo;s viability. Today&rsquo;s environment requires regular,
substantial investments in technology, which combined with libraries&rsquo; budget
woes, means smaller firms may not be able to survive or at least not keep up with
technological developments in the field. Having several vendors for a type of
product may provide a higher discount, at least when there is a degree of compe-
tition for the library&rsquo;s business. One drawback is that the service may not be as
good and perhaps the vendors will not have the resources to invest in newer tech-
nology. The primary concern should be service followed by financial strength&mdash;
it is not unheard of for major vendors to have serious financial problems.
</p>
<p>What Can Jobbers Do?
</p>
<p>Why buy from an indirect source that charges the same or a higher price
than the direct source would? Service! Jobbers provide an important service in
that they can save a library a significant amount of time and money. Although
jobbers do not give high discounts, the time saved by placing a single order for
ten different titles from ten different publishers (instead of ten different orders)
more than pays for the slightly higher price. Other savings can result from the
&ldquo;batch effect&rdquo; of unpacking fewer boxes and authorizing fewer payments. Most
jobbers also promise to provide fast, accurate service. It is true that a few pub-
lishers, if they accept single-copy orders (and most do), handle these orders more
slowly than they do large orders. But it is also true that jobbers do not always
have a specific title when the library wants it, which means that the library must
allow additional time to secure the desired item.
</p>
<p>Many jobbers promise twenty-four-hour shipment of items in stock. Do
they make good on such claims? Generally, yes; however, the key phrase is in
stock. Frequently, there can be delays of three to four months in receiving a com-
plete order because some titles are not in stock. When talking with jobbers, do
not become impressed by numbers quoted in their advertising, such as, &ldquo;more
than 2 million books in stock.&rdquo; What is important is how many titles and which
publishers they stock. For various reasons, from economic to personal, some
</p>
<p>Jobbers 183</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>publishers will refuse to deal with a particular jobber. Four important questions
to ask any jobber before a library contracts for that firm&rsquo;s services are
</p>
<p>1. Will you give me a list of all the publishers that you do not handle?
</p>
<p>2. How does your firm handle a request for a title not in stock?
</p>
<p>3. Will you give me a list of series that your firm does not handle?
</p>
<p>4. Do you have any service charges on any category of material? (If so,
ask if the charge is indicated on the invoice as a separate cost.)
</p>
<p>Often, the answer to the first question is difficult to obtain. Sales represen-
tatives want to say they can supply any title from any publisher, with only minor
exceptions. However, libraries in the same system may simultaneously receive
different lists from various representatives of the same firm. The issue is impor-
tant, and the acquisitions department must resolve the question if it is to operate
effectively. Sending an order for a title from a publisher that the jobber cannot
handle only delays matters. In some cases, the jobber will report that it is trying
to secure the item; this often leads to a later report of failure, making the acquisi-
tion process even slower. Buying directly from the publisher is the best approach
to this problem, if the library knows which publishers the jobber cannot handle.
</p>
<p>The second question relates to the speed of service. Some jobbers order a
single title from a publisher when it is not in stock. Others say they will do this
and they do; however, they frequently wait until they have received multiple
requests before placing the order. By placing a multiple-copy order, the jobber
receives a better discount. For the library, the delay may be one to several
months, because it will take that long for the jobber to accumulate enough indi-
vidual requests for the title to make up an order of sufficient size. The impact of
this practice may or may not be serious depending on where the library is in its
budget cycle, and inflation rates. (More about these issues appears later in this
chapter.) Usually, jobbers that place single-copy orders for a customer offer a
lower discount on such items or impose a service charge. Again, the acquisitions
staff must weigh service and speed against discount. Occasionally, a jobber will
have a title in stock after the publisher has listed the item as out-of-print (OP). On
occasion, a jobber can supply out-of-print material, and a few jobbers will even
try to find out-of-print items for their best customers. This is a special service
that is never advertised and is offered only to favored customers.
</p>
<p>Beyond fast, accurate service, jobbers should provide personal service. A
smooth working relationship is based on mutual understanding and respect.
When those are present, it is much easier to solve problems, even the difficult
ones. The jobber, because of the smaller base of customers, normally can pro-
vide answers more quickly than a publisher&rsquo;s customer service department can.
Even the small account customer receives a jobber&rsquo;s careful attention (to hold
the account), something that seldom happens with publishers.
</p>
<p>No single jobber can stock all of the in-print items that a library will need.
However, most large firms do carry the high-demand current and backlist items.
Book trade folklore says that 20 percent of the current and backlist titles repre-
sent 80 percent of total sales. All of the good jobbers try to stock the right 20
</p>
<p>184 9&mdash;Distributors and Vendors</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>percent of titles. Some are more successful at this than others. The approach
works well for bookstores; however, for libraries the need to acquire a broad
range of titles, including less popular ones, makes this practice less useful.
</p>
<p>One problem with a jobber that has limited stock is invoicing and billing
procedures. A small jobber may ship and bill for those items that are in stock,
then backorder the remainder of the titles. In this case, the jobber expects to re-
ceive payment for the partial fulfillment of the order. However, some funding
authorities allow payment only for complete orders. That is, the library must re-
ceive or cancel every item on an order before the business office will issue a
check. This procedure can cause problems for small jobbers and libraries alike.
Few small vendors are able or willing to wait for payment until a particular order
is complete. For small libraries with small materials budgets, the challenge is to
find a jobber that will accept complicated procedures and delays despite low vol-
ume. It is becoming harder to find such firms, and libraries are attempting to per-
suade their funding authorities to simplify ordering and payment procedures.
</p>
<p>Status reports are an area of concern for both the acquisitions and collection
development staff. Almost everyone in the field has been frustrated by these re-
ports. Does a report stating a book is out of print mean the book is really out of
print? It should, but occasionally, by contacting the publisher, the library may
have the item in hand in less than thirty days. This happens often enough to keep
doubts alive about the quality of jobber reports. An article in a 1989 issue of
School Library Journal reported that 10 percent of all school library orders and 7
percent of public library orders are unavailable for some reason.2 These figures
have not changed significantly since then.
</p>
<p>Does it really matter how accurate the reports are? Yes, it does matter, and
the result can have an impact on collection development. An item on order en-
cumbers (sets aside) the necessary funds for payment. The acquisitions staff can-
not determine the precise cost of the item until the invoice arrives; the price may
change, the exact discount is unknown, and shipping and handling charges vary.
Libraries hope to set aside slightly more than the total cost. Most libraries and
information centers have annual budgets and operate in systems where any unex-
pended monies at the end of the fiscal year revert to the general fund (that is, the
funds do not carry forward into the next fiscal year). In essence, the library loses
the unspent money. Having large sums of money tied up (encumbered) in out-
standing orders that are undeliverable before the end of the fiscal year can result
in a real loss for the collection. In a sense, the library loses twice: wanted items
go unreceived, and the library loses funds.
</p>
<p>Finally, as previously mentioned, the library does lose some buying power
as funds remain encumbered. Unlike money in a savings account, which earns a
small amount of interest each day, encumbered funds lose a small amount of
purchasing power each day. If inflation is rapid or if a library is buying foreign
books and the currency&rsquo;s value is fluctuating widely, losses can be large. Pro-
ducers raise prices without notice, and in times of inflation, libraries can count on
regular price increases. The less time funds remain encumbered, the more pur-
chasing power the library has. Thus, the accuracy of vendors&rsquo; reports is impor-
tant. If the vendor cannot supply an item (OP, OS, or TOS) in time, and so

<p>informs the library, the library can cancel the order and use the funds for some-
thing that is available for delivery. Monitoring of vendor performance in report
accuracy and speed of delivery can help control the problem.
</p>
<p>Where does a library learn about vendors and services? Beyond attending
library association conferences and &ldquo;word of mouth&rdquo; suggestions from peers,
there are several guides available. General publications such as Literary Market
Place, International Literary Market Place, International Subscription Agent,
Quill &amp; Quire&rsquo;s Canadian Publishers Directory, or specialized lists by format,
region of the world, and subject matter will provide a long list of possibilities.
One can also post questions about vendor experiences on acquisitions discussion
lists, such as ACQNET (ACQNET-L@listproc.appstate.edu).
</p>
<p>A number of jobbers offer their services to U.S. libraries. Some of the larger
and more active firms in marketing their programs are Brodart, Baker &amp; Taylor,
Ingram, Yankee Book Peddler, Ballen, Coutts, and Blackwell North America, as
well as National Book Service in Canada. There also are specialized jobbers,
such as Majors, a leading firm for medical, science, and technical books, and
French Language Resources, a Canadian firm that provides French-language
books for schools and classrooms. Serials jobbers include EBSCO, Faxon, and
Readmore.
</p>
<p>When selecting a vendor, keep the following factors in mind:
</p>
<p>&bull; Service&mdash;a representative, toll free numbers, Web sites, and so forth.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quality of service&mdash;ask for and check references, ease of handling
&ldquo;problems&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; Speed of fulfillment&mdash;including accuracy
</p>
<p>&bull; Discount/pricing
</p>
<p>&bull; Vendor&rsquo;s financial viability
</p>
<p>&bull; Vendor ability to work with the library&rsquo;s automation system
</p>
<p>&bull; Special services available&mdash;free or at a cost
</p>
<p>Needless to say, these are the same factors to use to evaluate the vendor(s) after
selection.
</p>
<p>Vendor-Added Services
</p>
<p>Today, most vendors offer services beyond the basics of supplying books,
serials, media, and electronic resources at &ldquo;wholesale prices.&rdquo; Some of the more
common services are
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition assistance&mdash;e.g., searching and verification
</p>
<p>&bull; Automated selection assistance programs (some including book reviews)
</p>
<p>&bull; Book rental plans
</p>
<p>&bull; Cataloging and shelf-ready processing
</p>
<p>186 9&mdash;Distributors and Vendors</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Customized management data
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic financial transactions beyond the basics
</p>
<p>&bull; More than one information format
</p>
<p>&bull; Provision of electronic tables of contents or machine readable data
</p>
<p>&bull; Library furniture
</p>
<p>&bull; Library supplies
</p>
<p>As this list suggests, vendors are entering the outsourcing market and some
are attempting to offer most of the supplies and services necessary for library
operations.
</p>
<p>One jobber, Brodart, offers a rather unusual service, the McNaughton Plan,
to help solve the problem of providing an adequate number of high-demand titles
for both books and audio books. Most libraries have suffered the problem of high
demand for a popular book, with the demand lasting only a few months. Should
the library buy many copies and discard all but one or two after the demand sub-
sides, or buy only a few copies and take reservations? The McNaughton Plan
offers another alternative: rent multiple copies for the duration of the title&rsquo;s pop-
ularity. Brodart describes the plan as a leasing program. The plan offers high-
demand items that Brodart&rsquo;s staff selects. A library cannot order just any book; it
must be on Brodart&rsquo;s list of high-demand titles. Savings occur in several areas.
There are no processing costs because the books come ready for the shelf, and
the leasing fee is considerably lower than the item&rsquo;s purchase price. End-users
are happy because of shorter waiting times for the latest bestseller. All in all, any-
one involved in meeting recreational reading needs will find the program worth
investigating. College and university libraries may use it to stock a variety of
materials for recreational reading without taking too much money out of the
book fund. Libraries also avoid filling their valuable shelf space with large num-
bers of duplicates of once-popular titles.
</p>
<p>Two additional services many vendors offer are electronic ordering and,
especially useful for serials, electronic invoicing. Access to an electronic version
of Books in Print is often part of the service as well. With electronic ordering,
acquisitions staff have online access to the vendor&rsquo;s inventory database. This al-
lows them to learn the availability of a title, place an order, receive confirmation
of receipt of the order, and receive the invoice electronically, in a matter of a few
seconds. One problem with electronic ordering is that most acquisitions depart-
ments use many different vendors, and each vendor offering this type of service
seems to develop a number of variations in its system. This is an area where stan-
dards could be beneficial to everyone. Learning and remembering, or consulting
vendor manuals, or calling help desk numbers for several different electronic
ordering systems, cuts into the potential time savings from using such systems.
</p>
<p>Some vendors offer useful management reports based on their electronic
systems. Figure 9.1, page 188&ndash;89, represents a sample report from a serials ven-
dor. An example from a book vendor is illustrated in Figure 9.2, page 190. Such
reports assist the library in making budget requests and estimating encum-
brances for standing orders and blanket orders.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>What Should Jobbers and Acquisitions Departments
Expect from Each Other?
</p>
<p>Departmental staff have a responsibility for helping to maintain good work-
ing relationships with vendors. Simply stated, a vendor&rsquo;s profits are the differ-
ence between the price it pays producers and the resale price. Is this any different
than for any other type of business? Not in the fundamentals, but there are some
special aspects to the book trade and library market. One such variation is that
anyone can buy directly from the materials producer. This is seldom true in other
fields. Another difference is that, to a large degree, libraries can determine what
is the maximum price of any item by checking in-print lists, such as Books in
Print, or by consulting the producer. When every buyer knows the maximum
price as well as any producer discount, vendors must at least match the maxi-
mum price and provide superior service to retain customers.
</p>
<p>As explained previously, volume buying and selling is the only way a job-
ber can make a profit. Efficient plant operations and low overhead can help, but
no matter how efficient the operation, it will fail without high volume. One order
for fifteen or twenty titles in quantities will yield a high discount for the jobber,
perhaps as high as 60 percent. Even after giving a 20 percent to 25 percent
discount to the library, the jobber has a comfortable margin with which to work.
In the library market, such orders are usually the exception rather than the rule.
More often, the jobber&rsquo;s discount is 50 percent. A smaller margin is still acceptable
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>if all the items sell. But all of them do not! Many publishers have a return policy
(in which a publisher buys back unsold books). However, many producers are
changing or dropping the return policy, thus increasing the risk for the vendor.
Returns normally result in credits against the current account or future pur-
chases. They seldom result in a cash refund for book jobbers.
</p>
<p>To get the maximum discount, some librarians dump their &ldquo;problem&rdquo; or-
ders on vendors and order easy items directly from the publishers. Nothing could
be more shortsighted. Without the income from easy, high-volume items, no job-
ber can stay in business. Someone has to handle the problem orders, and most
vendors will try to track down the difficult items, especially for good customers.
However, libraries should give jobbers easy orders as well. Many of the prob-
lems facing jobbers involve cash flow. Lack of cash has been the downfall of
many businesses, and it becomes critical for jobbers when they handle only
problem orders; staff expenses go up, but income does not. Failure of jobbers
would lead to higher labor costs for most acquisitions departments as a result of
having to place all orders directly with publishers.
</p>
<p>Whenever possible, the library should use the order format preferred by the
vendor (this is almost always the outlines in the Guidelines mentioned previ-
ously) and not plead legal or system requirements for a particular method of order-
ing, unless it is impossible to change the requirement. Most vendors and publish-
ers go out of their way to accommodate the legal requirements of library ordering
procedures. The fewer variations libraries ask for, the better service vendors can
provide because they do not have to keep track of hundreds of variations.

<p>Finally, libraries should process invoices promptly; the acquisitions depart-
ment should not hold them longer than necessary. Most library systems require
at least two approvals before issuing a payment voucher: the library&rsquo;s approval
and the business office&rsquo;s approval. Some systems have three or more offices in-
volved in the approval process. The acquisitions department should fully under-
stand the payment process for its parent organization (e.g., school district, city,
or university)&mdash;from department approval to final payment. If payment takes
longer than six weeks, the library should inform any new jobber of that fact so
the firm can decide whether it can do business with the library. It is also neces-
sary to inform jobbers of any changes in the system that may have an impact on
the speed of payment. Most jobbers would like to receive payment within thirty
days because they are on a thirty-day payment cycle with publishers.
</p>
<p>Jobbers provide a valuable service to libraries. Given a good working rela-
tionship, both parties benefit. Following is a summary of the basic factors at
work in establishing such a relationship.
</p>
<p>What Do Libraries Expect from Jobbers?
</p>
<p>Acquisition departments have a right to expect that a jobber will provide
</p>
<p>&bull; A large inventory of titles in appropriate formats,
</p>
<p>&bull; Prompt and accurate order fulfillment,
</p>
<p>&bull; Prompt and accurate reporting on items not in stock, and
</p>
<p>&bull; Personal service at a reasonable price.
</p>
<p>What Do Jobbers Expect from Libraries?
</p>
<p>Jobbers have a right to expect
</p>
<p>&bull; Time to get to know what the library needs,
</p>
<p>&bull; Cooperation in placing orders,
</p>
<p>&bull; Keeping paperwork to a minimum, and
</p>
<p>&bull; Prompt payment for services.
</p>
<p> ��'&amp;��� ��"�
�&amp;�
</p>
<p>In the 1990s, many libraries entered into formal contracts with vendors.
The contract is the result of either a formal bidding process or responding to a
&ldquo;Request for Proposal&rdquo; (RFP). If a library has a choice (often public and aca-
demic libraries have to employ a bidding process), the RFP is the better option.
Often the bid process is out of the library&rsquo;s hands and conducted by business offi-
cers who do not fully understand that information materials are not the same as
pencils, paper, or even computers. With the RFP there should be at least some li-
brary input as to the requirements, if the library is not solely responsible for creating
</p>
<p>Vendor Evaluation 191</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the document. An RFP will (or should) contain all the elements that the library
will use to evaluate the vendor&rsquo;s performance as well as specifying performance
perimeters. The Suggested Reading section in this chapter provides references to
resources that will assist in preparing an acquisitions RFP.
</p>
<p>Even without a formal contract, acquisitions departments should monitor
vendor performance. In the past, monitoring vendors was time-consuming and
difficult, and it still is if a library is working with a manual acquisitions system.
However, today&rsquo;s automated acquisitions systems can produce a variety of use-
ful management and vendor reports very quickly and in various formats.
Knowing what to do with the quantity of data the systems can produce is another
matter. (Note: There are two types of evaluation acquisitions staff undertake.
One is more a monitoring of vendor performance with an eye to identifying small
concerns that left unnoticed could become a major issue. The other is a formal
assessment of the vendor with an eye toward changing vendors or renewing a
contract.)
</p>
<p>One obvious issue that arises in the evaluation process is which vendor per-
forms best on a given type of order (examples are conference proceedings, music
scores, or videorecordings). The first thing to do is to decide what best means.
Highest discount? Fastest delivery? Most accurate reports? Highest percentage
of the order filled with the first shipment? All of the above? The answer varies
from library to library depending on local needs and conditions. Once the library
defines best, it knows what data to get from the system. This is a situation in
which the RFP process is of assistance; the answers to these questions should be
in that document. Other evaluation issues are
</p>
<p>&bull; Who handles rush orders most efficiently?
</p>
<p>&bull; Who handles international orders most effectively&mdash;a dealer in the coun-
try of origin or a general international dealer?
</p>
<p>&bull; Are specialty dealers more effective in handling their specialties than are
general dealers?
</p>
<p>Figure 9.3, pages 193&ndash;95, is a sample of system reports illustrating several
years&rsquo; performance of some of Loyola Marymount University Library&rsquo;s book
vendors. It shows quantities of titles ordered, total expended, average delivery
time, percentage of the order received, average cost of each order, what, if any,
shipping/handling charges there were, and the discount for each of the vendors.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In addition to generating system reports based on normal operating proce-
dures, a library can conduct some experiments by placing a random sample of a
type of order with several vendors to assess their performance. When doing a test
or experiment be certain that each vendor receives approximately the same mix
of titles, that no vendor receives more or fewer easy or hard-to-handle items. Of-
ten, the normal procedure data reflect the use of a particular vendor for only one
type of order. This makes comparing vendor performance rather meaningless
because one is not comparing like groups. The library can use the test method to
select a vendor for a particular type of order and use the operating data approach
to monitor ongoing performance.
</p>
<p>Checking on the performance of serials vendors is more difficult. Most li-
braries use only one domestic serials vendor and perhaps a second firm that spe-
cializes in journals from other countries. A library that is just establishing a
current subscription list, or starting a large number of new subscriptions, might
consider splitting the list between two or more vendors for several years to deter-
mine which would be the best sole source for the long term.
</p>
<p>A limited amount of checking is possible through comparisons with other
libraries. Often, this type of checking is done in a casual manner, that is, by
merely asking a colleague in another library, &ldquo;Do you use vendor X? How do you
like them?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How much is your service charge?&rdquo; To make valid and useful
comparisons, a library needs to know the other library&rsquo;s title mix. Recent devel-
opments of union catalogs based on OPAC data suggest that collections, even in
apparently similar libraries, have surprisingly different holdings. A comparison
was made of the monograph holdings of Loyola Marymount University, Santa
Clara University, University of San Francisco, and the University of San Diego
libraries for a ten-year period using the AMIGOS CD-ROM collection analysis
software (Note: Does not contain serials titles). The university librarians thought
the collections would have a large percentage of overlap because the institutions
are similar in size, programs, and general emphasis on the liberal arts. All were
surprised to learn that more than 80,000 titles of the 159,000 titles in the database
were unique; that is, only one of the four schools held the title. Although the re-
sults were not as striking for serials holdings, the number of titles held by just one
library was a surprise. These discoveries served to reinforce the idea that casual
impressionistic assessments are suspect.
</p>
<p>One way to compare serials vendors is to investigate a sample of commonly
held titles. Factors to examine include the service charges on those titles, the
effectiveness of claims processing, and other issues like vendor follow-up and
handling of credit memos.
</p>
<p>In any vendor evaluation, keep in mind some of the problems vendors have
with producers:
</p>
<p>&bull; Changes in title, or not publishing the title;
</p>
<p>&bull; Not being informed when publishing schedules change or when publishers
suspend or cease publication;
</p>
<p>&bull; Incorrect ISBNs or ISSNs;
</p>
<p>&bull; Producers refusing to take returns;
</p>
<p>196 9&mdash;Distributors and Vendors</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Producers refusing to sell through vendors;
</p>
<p>&bull; Producers reducing discounts or charging for freight and handling, when
those were free in the past;
</p>
<p>&bull; Poor fulfillment on the producer&rsquo;s part;
</p>
<p>&bull; Constantly changing policies on the producer&rsquo;s part; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Producer price increases without prior notice.
</p>
<p>References to several &ldquo;models&rdquo; for conducting vendor evaluation studies are in-
cluded in the Suggested Reading section of this chapter.
</p>
<p>Several years ago, a student in one of Ed Evans&rsquo;s courses asked during a
discussion of vendors, &ldquo;Why are you so pro-vendor? They are our enemies, with
all their high prices and low discounts.&rdquo; Perhaps Ed Evans&rsquo;s work experience in
bookstores, publishing, and libraries is a factor in his not being highly negative
about vendors. However, it is not a matter of being &ldquo;so pro-vendor&rdquo; but rather
recognizing that there are at least two sides to most stories. Libraries depend on
vendors; they offer services that save libraries time, effort, and staffing. Libraries
need vendors and need to understand their problems.
</p>
<p>That said, libraries must monitor their performance, question charges, and
challenge charges that seem inappropriate. Maintaining good relations is every-
one&rsquo;s business. If librarians, vendors, and producers take time to learn about one
another&rsquo;s business, working relationships will be better.
</p>
<p>Some years ago a new regional manager of the serials vendor used by LMU
who had no prior experience in the library marketing sector asked if he could
spend a week in the library learning how LMU library handled journals and how
library customers use journals. He spent three days in technical services with the
serials acquisition staff and two days in public services. Even if LMU operations
are not completely typical, his experience made him more aware of the problems
libraries face in handling serials. Another outcome was that several of the LMU
staff spent two days observing the vendor&rsquo;s operations. Increased understanding
of one another&rsquo;s problems solidified an already good working relationship. It is
not necessary to go to such lengths, but reading about developments in each
other&rsquo;s field and asking informed questions builds mutual understanding and
respect. Having realistic expectations is key, just as it is in personal relation-
ships. Be professional and ethical in working with vendors and publishers; ex-
pect and demand the same from them.

<p>The book distribution system in the United States is cumbersome and fre-
quently adds to the cost of books. A simplified system would benefit everyone.
Perhaps the best illustration of the complexity of the system is in the area of dis-
counts, returns, billings, and so forth. Each year the American Booksellers Asso-
ciation (ABA) publishes a 500-page guide, ABA Book Buyer&rsquo;s Handbook (New
York: American Booksellers Association, 1947- ). Pity the poor bookseller, con-
fronted with all of the other problems of a bookstore, that also must work through a
</p>
<p>Retail Outlets 197</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>mass of legal forms and sales conditions for purchasing from various publishers.
This process does create extra work for the bookseller and publisher, and they
undoubtedly pass their costs on to the buyer.
</p>
<p>In general, bookstores can be a valuable means of acquiring new books.
Carrying out visual inspection of local stores and discussing the library&rsquo;s needs
with their owners can forge an important link in the selection and acquisition
program. Libraries in large metropolitan areas generally have good bookstores
nearby, but many libraries are lucky if there is one bookstore in the community.
Although most libraries will spend only a small portion of the materials budget in
such stores, the possibility is worth exploring. Most bookstores have limited
potential as a major source of supply for acquisitions departments, but when a
general bookstore exists nearby, the library ought to talk to the owner to deter-
mine what, if any, business relationship might be possible. It may take time for
the relationship to fully develop, but it can prove mutually beneficial. (Note: The
large U. S. national chains, such as Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, operate very
differently from local stores and are not likely to be able to accommodate library
needs beyond occasionally allowing a &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; or &ldquo;educational&rdquo; discount on
some of the titles they carry.)
</p>
<p>Quebec libraries must purchase their books from at least three accredited
bookstores. Such bookstores must be based in Quebec and owned by a Quebecer.
Some libraries, however, are able to buy books directly from distributors be-
cause they have private funding also.
</p>
<p>A reasonable question to pose at this point is &ldquo;what about Internet book-
stores?&rdquo; Is, in fact, Amazon.com considered a retailer or a wholesaler? An early
2001 check of Yahoo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Books&rdquo; page had links to more than 490 online stores
(both new and out-of-print sources). Certainly these stores are popular, but not
always the quickest means of getting a book in hand, at least during holiday periods.
</p>
<p>Loyola Marymount University library has been using Amazon.com for
several years for the purchase of some popular items. (We should note that it did
take some effort to develop a workable means of payment.) Monica Fusich wrote
a brief article on the use of Amazon.com and other e-stores that appeared in
C&amp;RL News.3 She outlined several services she found useful as a collection de-
velopment officer who has other duties as well. (Being a reference librarian or
some other &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; assignment as well as having selection responsibilities is
very common in today&rsquo;s library environment.) The features she mentioned were
</p>
<p>&bull; Cumulated book reviews (one must remember some of the reviews are
from the general public),
</p>
<p>&bull; Search and browsing capability,
</p>
<p>&bull; Size of the database(s),
</p>
<p>&bull; Coverage of both in- and out-of-print titles as well as nonbook media,
and
</p>
<p>&bull; Notification services (a rather limited SDI service as of mid-1999).
</p>
<p>Although e-stores are not the answer to the challenges facing busy acquisition
departments, they can be of assistance and should not be dismissed out-of-hand.

<p>Retrospective collection building is one of the most interesting and chal-
lenging areas of acquisitions work. It was also one of the last to experience the
impact of technology and the Internet. Libraries buy retrospectively for two rea-
sons: to fill in gaps in the collection and to replace worn out or lost copies of
titles. There has been a steady decline in retrospective buying on the part of li-
braries over the past twenty years due to limited budgets, as well as the need to
increase purchases of nonprint and electronic resources. Another factor in the de-
cline has been the proliferation of bibliographic databases such as OCLC, which
make locating a copy of an out-of-print title to borrow through ILL much easier.
As a result, acquisitions staff and selectors have decreasing experience to draw
upon when they need to work in this field. (Dealers in this field are a &ldquo;special
breed&rdquo; unlike other vendors with which the library has more experience.) One
outcome of the decline is that the field, which has always been very dependent on
collectors, is even more driven today by collector interests than by library needs.
</p>
<p>Allowing for overlap, there are two broad categories of out-of-print (OP)
dealers. (It should be noted that most of these individuals dislike the label &ldquo;sec-
ondhand dealer.&rdquo;) One category focuses primarily on general OP books, that is,
on buying and selling relatively recent OP books. Often, these books sell at
prices that are the same as, or only slightly higher than, their publication price.
The other category of dealer focuses on rare, antiquarian, and special (for exam-
ple, fore-edged painted, miniature, or private press) books. Prices for this type of
book can range from around U.S.$10 to several thousand dollars per item.
</p>
<p>The face of this field is changing. Margaret Landesman provides an excel-
lent, detailed outline of the current types of dealers:
</p>
<p>&bull; Book scouts, working part-time or full-time, searching out desirable
books and selling them to dealers and collectors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Neighborhood stores that operate part- or full-time from low-cost facili-
ties and depend primarily on walk-in trade and a few very loyal cus-
tomers. They seldom issue catalogs or engage in searching except for
their best customers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Specialized dealers that often issue catalogs and do searching in their
specialty but more and more often operate only by mail or electronically
(via e-mail or an Internet Web site).
</p>
<p>&bull; General out-of-print dealers who have a rather large stock in varied
areas; many have specialties as well. Some offer search services; some
issue catalogs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Mixed in- and out-of-print stores&mdash;often a store that is an independent
new bookshop trying to survive the competition from the &ldquo;superstores&rdquo;
by diversifying.
</p>
<p>&bull; Academic library book vendors that also offer out-of-print search services.
</p>
<p>Out-of-Print, Antiquarian, and Rare Book Dealers 199</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Rare book dealers specializing in rare and expensive titles. Most estab-
lished rare book dealers do not handle the more ordinary scholarly
out-of-print titles, but many general out-of-print dealers also handle
some rare books.4
</p>
<p>The vast majority of such dealers have small shops in low-rent areas or op-
erate out of their homes. Because of this diversity, it is difficult to make many
generalizations about this group. Sol Malkin paints a cheery picture of at least
part of the out-of-print trade:
</p>
<p>Imagine a separate book world within the world of books where
dealers set up their businesses where they please (store or
office, home or barn); where the minimum markup is 100 per-
cent; where they can call upon 5,000 fellow dealers throughout
the world and a stock of over 200 million volumes, practically
from the beginning of the printed word; where books are safely
packed and mailed with no extra charge for postage; where
there is no competition from the publishers and discount
houses; where colleagues help one another in time of need to
provide fellow dealers with a unique service that makes cus-
tomers happy all the time&mdash;an ideal imaginary book world that
never was nor ever will be? Perhaps . . . but the above is 99 per-
cent true in the antiquarian book trade.5
</p>
<p>Most libraries will have occasion to use the services of these dealers. Ac-
quisitions departments that handle purchases for large research collections tend
to spend much of their time (or at least they did in the past) engaged in retrospec-
tive purchasing activities. Changes in organizational goals and programs may re-
sult in developing whole new areas of collecting both current and retrospective
materials. Public libraries also buy from OP dealers, especially for replacement
copies and occasionally for retrospective collection building. School libraries
make limited use of this distribution system. When they do it is for replacement
copies. Scientific and technical libraries rarely need to worry about acquiring ret-
rospective materials.
</p>
<p>Several directories to antiquarian or rare book dealers (for example, Ameri-
can Book Trade Directory from R. R. Bowker) provide information about spe-
cialties, and anyone concerned with acquisitions work should become familiar
with these directories. Some major metropolitan areas have local directories or
guides to special bookstores. An acquisitions department will find it worthwhile
to develop a listing of local shops. Such a list can provide quick information
about search services, hours, and true specialties. Although a buyer can go to a
shop that advertises itself as a &ldquo;Western Americana&rdquo; store only to find the spe-
cialty stock very limited or overpriced, one should still examine the shop&rsquo;s stock
to identify its true specialties and assess its general pricing polices. Maintaining
this private directory can prove well worth the time required to keep it
up-to-date. This is not to say that the published sources are worthless. How-
ever, owners do change their emphasis, and their stock turns over and is subject
</p>
<p>200 9&mdash;Distributors and Vendors</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>to local economic conditions that often change faster than published sources can
monitor.
</p>
<p>Many acquisitions librarians and book dealers classify OP book distribu-
tion services into three general types: (1) a complete book service, (2) a complete
sales service, and (3) a complete bookstore. The first two may operate in a man-
ner that does not allow, or at least require, customers to come to the seller&rsquo;s loca-
tion. All contact is by mail, e-mail, and telephone. The owner may maintain only
a small stock of choice items in a garage or basement. In a complete book service,
a dealer actively searches for items for a customer even if the items are not in
stock, by placing an ad in a publication like AB Bookman&rsquo;s Weekly (Antiquarian
Bookman).
</p>
<p>A sales service is just what the name implies: A dealer reads the &ldquo;wanted&rdquo;
sections of book trade publications and sends off quotes on items in his or her
stock. Such services seldom place ads or conduct searches for a customer. The
complete bookstore is a store operation that depends on in-person trade. Stores of
this type often engage in book service and sales service activities as well. Given
the unpredictable nature of the OP trade, it is an unusual store that does not need
to exploit every possible sales outlet.
</p>
<p>AB Bookman&rsquo;s Weekly (AB) is a weekly publication devoted solely to ad-
vertisements from dealers offering or searching for particular titles. Publications
of this type are an essential ingredient in the OP book trade, because they serve as
a finding and selling tool. Without services like this, the cost of acquiring an OP
item would be much higher (assuming the library could locate a copy without the
service).
</p>
<p>Other useful publications for both dealers and libraries are AB&rsquo;s Yearbook,
Bookman&rsquo;s Price Index (Gale), Bowker&rsquo;s Books Out-of-Print, Ruth Robinson
and Daryush Farudi&rsquo;s Buy Books Where&mdash;Sell Books Where (Robinson Books),
American Book Prices Current (Bancroft Parkman), and Library Bookseller
(Antiquarian Bookman). Some of the more useful Web sites are listed near the
end of this chapter; one such site is Bibliofind (http://www.bibliofind.com).
</p>
<p>Prices OP dealers set are based on a number of interrelated factors:
</p>
<p>1. How much it costs to acquire the item.
</p>
<p>2. The amount of current interest in collecting a particular subject or author.
</p>
<p>3. The number of copies printed and the number of copies still in exis-
tence.
</p>
<p>4. The physical condition of the copy.
</p>
<p>5. Any special features of the particular copy (autographed by the author
or signed or owned by a famous person, for example).
</p>
<p>6. What other dealers are asking for copies of the same edition in the
same condition.
</p>
<p>Without question, the current asking price is the major determining factor&mdash;
given equal conditions in the other five areas&mdash;thus making sales catalogs and
AB major pricing tools.
</p>
<p>Out-of-Print, Antiquarian, and Rare Book Dealers 201</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A few additional facts about the condition of OP books are important for
beginning librarians to know because they bear directly on price. The condition
of the book will affect its price. A library may assume that most OP dealers sell
their stock as described or &ldquo;as is.&rdquo; If there is no statement about the item&rsquo;s condi-
tion, it should be in good or better condition. A common statement in catalogs is
&ldquo;terms&mdash;all books in original binding and in good or better condition unless oth-
erwise stated.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Working in this area can be fun and frustrating at the same time. Clearly
there is a need for experience with dealers to know if their descriptions of their
offerings are good enough for the library. There is also the nagging question of
&ldquo;fair market price&rdquo; for what is often a one-of-a-kind offering, at least at that
moment. There are commercial guides that can help with evaluating the asking/
quoted price such as Bookman&rsquo;s Price Index (Detroit: Gale Research, 1964- ),
American Book Prices Current (New York: Bancroft-Parkman, 1930- , annual),
and Book-Auction Records (London: W. Dawson, 1902- , annual).

</p>
<p>Because of the variety of their formats and purposes, it is not possible to gen-
eralize about retail outlets for other media. In most cases, libraries acquire most of
the formats directly from their producers or from an educational media jobber.
</p>
<p>Other than music and video stores, for music recordings two of the fre-
quently used are Rose&rsquo;s in Chicago, and Berkshire Record Outlet in Lee, Massa-
chusetts. There are some others, too, but these have huge inventories and give
significant discounts to libraries. Acquisitions staff should keep in mind that for
media there are a few map shops in larger cities. Most metropolitan areas have at
least one sheet music store, and there are museums that sell slides and art repro-
ductions. Sometimes needed educational models and games can be found at a
teacher supply store.
</p>
<p>�����
��%� ��'&amp;��
</p>
<p>By this point it should be clear that the process of selecting a vendor is
rather complex. When selecting the source from which to secure materials (ven-
dor assignment), the staff should consider speed of delivery, discounts given,
and service. Speed of order fulfillment is significant because users may be wait-
ing to use the material. The longer the wait for the material, the more unhappy
the requesters become. In essence, speed is a public relations consideration as
well as a service issue. Public relations is an especially important aspect in a
tax-supported institution. Speed of order fulfillment may also come into play at
the end of the fiscal year. In addition, in educational and special libraries, occa-
sionally there is a need to place a &ldquo;rush order&rdquo; for urgently needed material.
Sometimes the need is so urgent that the library places the order electronically or
by fax and pays for next-day delivery.
</p>
<p>Obviously, the greater the discount a library receives, the more money will
be available to buy additional materials. Because very few libraries have enough
</p>
<p>202 9&mdash;Distributors and Vendors</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>money to buy everything they could use, stretching funds can contribute to an
improved library collection. The question of discounts can occupy a major seg-
ment of the department head&rsquo;s time. Library materials&mdash;whether books, films, or
phonograph records&mdash;are unique in that each item appeals to different groups of
users. The producers of the items are aware of this differing appeal, and they vary
their discounts accordingly (the wider the appeal, the greater the discount). For
this reason, very few sources of library materials will promise a blanket discount
on all items purchased on a single purchase order. Because of variable discounts,
shipping and handling charges, and taxes, no one in the department knows ex-
actly how much money is available, except on the first and last day of a fiscal
year.
</p>
<p>Service is the most important factor to consider in selecting a supplier.
Questions to consider when evaluating a firm&rsquo;s service policy include the
following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Does the firm correct mistakes quickly with minimal paperwork?
</p>
<p>&bull; Does it offer extra services in addition to the basic service (such as full
processing for a small added fee)?
</p>
<p>&bull; Does it provide free shipping or forgo handling charges on orders over a
certain amount?
</p>
<p>&bull; Can it handle the library&rsquo;s invoicing and payment requirements?
</p>
<p>Ease in dealing with a source is the most important service factor. A great
deal of time and energy goes into handling problems with orders. Finding a sup-
plier who reduces such problems and frees staff members for more productive
work is the goal in vendor assignment. Figure 9.4, page 204, provides an over-
view of some of the factors involved.
</p>
<p>Most libraries maintain a file of current vendors. In most automated acqui-
sitions systems, the file is available online. Coding allows the system to print the
full address of the vendor selected to receive the order. It is fairly common for a
system to have several codes for the same vendor (note the four codes for Baker
&amp; Taylor in Figure 9.5, page 205). The reason for that is that the library may have
two or more programs operating with the vendor and may want to track each one
separately. In that case the library needs a code for each program. In the example,
the code &ldquo;bakea&rdquo; is for an approval plan, &ldquo;bakec&rdquo; is for items from the notifica-
tion slip program, &ldquo;baker&rdquo; is for direct orders (nonapproval or slip), and &ldquo;bakev&rdquo;
is for video and other media orders. Large libraries frequently have hundreds
of vendors on their list. Most automated acquisitions systems provide a vendor-
coding arrangement that allows a keystroke or two to generate the vendor&rsquo;s full
name and mailing address. The coding also allows the department to more easily
evaluate vendor performance because the staff can quickly sort the orders by
vendor.

<p>Because so many variables enter the picture, the choice of sources is com-
plex and important. In some states (for example, New York and Minnesota),
publicly supported libraries must select vendors from an approved list of suppli-
ers. Even in those circumstances the list of approved companies can be long and
the same selection factors come into play.
</p>
<p>Following are the only generalizations that can be made regarding how li-
braries tend to operate in this area:
</p>
<p>1. For current trade items, libraries use jobbers.
</p>
<p>2. For other current materials, libraries use the publisher or jobbers.
</p>
<p>3. For very popular current materials with an immediate need, libraries
may try retailers.
</p>
<p>4. For out-of-print items, libraries rely on retailers.
</p>
<p>5. For items and serials from other countries, most libraries use jobbers.

<p>The distribution system for books and other library materials is varied and
complex and must be understood and appreciated by acquisitions staff. This
chapter provides highlights of what the library needs to know; and it portrays just
the beginning of a long, challenging, but enjoyable learning process. Jobbers,
book dealers, and media vendors are more than willing to explain how they mod-
ify their operations to accommodate library requirements, when they know that a
librarian has taken time to learn something about their operations. Figure 9.4
summarizes some of the key points involved in selecting a vendor.

<p>1. A jobber buys merchandise from manufacturers and sells it to retailers. A whole-
saler sells large quantities of goods to a retailer. (In Canadian libraries, the publishing
terms jobber and wholesaler are synonymous.) A drop shipper orders materials from
manufacturers after receiving an order from a retailer (or library). Unlike jobbers and
wholesalers, a drop shipper does not have a stock of materials, just a telephone.

</p>
<p>Serials, regardless of their format, are important sources of current infor-
mation for the public. Libraries attempt to maintain as large a collection of seri-
als as their budgets will allow, but costs and space considerations have
significantly modified the &ldquo;all and forever&rdquo; retention philosophy that many seri-
als departments employed in the past.
</p>
<p>Serial work is interesting, challenging, and frustrating. The following poem
sums up the work nicely:

<p>In the past ten to fifteen years paper-based serials have begun to change in
character. Once started, the move toward electronic and Web-based serials pub-
lication gained significant momentum. Chapter 11 explores the new dimension
of electronic serials management. Here it is important just to note that the issue
exists and is rapidly becoming another major cost concern for libraries and a
major consideration for acquisitions staff.

</p>
<p>Individuals (customers and librarians alike) frequently use the words jour-
nals, magazines, periodicals, and serials interchangeably, with no great misun-
derstanding resulting from the imprecise usage. Thomas Nisonger, in his fine
book on serials management,2 devoted over six pages to how different groups
have attempted to define the material that is covered in this and the next chapter.
</p>
<p>The ALA Glossary of Library and Information Science provides the follow-
ing definitions of two key terms, which are adequate for the purposes of this
chapter:
</p>
<p>Serial&mdash;&ldquo;a publication issued in successive parts, usually at
regular intervals, and, as a rule, intended to be continued indefi-
nitely. Serials include periodicals, annuals (reports, yearbooks,
etc.) and memoirs, proceedings, and transactions of societies.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Periodical&mdash;&ldquo;a publication with a distinctive title intended to
appear in successive (usually unbound) numbers of parts at
stated or regular intervals and, as a rule, for an indefinite time.
Each part generally contains articles by several contributors.
Newspapers, whose chief function it is to disseminate news,
and the memoirs, proceedings, journals, etc. of societies are not
considered periodicals.&rdquo;3
</p>
<p>Definitions in general dictionaries have more overlap:
</p>
<p>Journal&mdash;&ldquo;a periodical publication especially dealing with
matters of current interest&mdash;often used for official or semi-official
publications of special groups.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Magazine&mdash;&ldquo;a periodical that usually contains a miscellaneous
collection of articles, stories, poems, and pictures and is di-
rected at the general reading public.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Periodical&mdash;&ldquo;a magazine or other publication of which the is-
sues appear at stated or regular intervals&mdash;usually for a
publication appearing more frequently than annually but infre-
quently used for a newspaper.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Serial&mdash;&ldquo;a publication (as a newspaper, journal, yearbook, or
bulletin) issued as one of a consecutively numbered and indefi-
nitely continued series.&rdquo;4
</p>
<p>The term serials is used here because it represents the broadest spectrum of
materials.
</p>
<p>Some years ago, Fritz Machlup and others developed an eighteen-part
classification system for serials.5 The following discussion follows their
</p>
<p>What Is a Serial? 211</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>classification system because it covers all types of serials, including serials &ldquo;not
elsewhere classified.&rdquo; We have yet to encounter a serial that does not fit into one
of the other seventeen categories. Each of the major categories described in this
chapter has some special features that have implications for the acquisitions
staff.
</p>
<p>Institutional Reports
</p>
<p>The first major category is &ldquo;annual, semiannual, quarterly or occasional re-
ports of corporations, financial institutions, and organizations serving business
and finance.&rdquo; Academic libraries serving business and management programs
frequently need to acquire this type of serial. Some corporate libraries also ac-
tively collect this category. Most of the reports available to libraries and infor-
mation centers are free for the asking. Some organizations will add a library to
their distribution list, but others will respond only to requests for the current edi-
tion. Collecting in this area is labor-intensive, because it requires maintaining
address and correspondence files, especially if a library collects much beyond
the large national corporations. Without question, having a computer system that
has both word processing and e-mail capabilities will make collecting less
tedious, but it will not reduce the need to constantly monitor the program. Corpo-
rate annual reports are issued every month. Many companies issue their annual
reports for the annual meeting of the management board, owners, or stockholders,
which normally occurs in the month the organization was established. It had
been difficult to find a satisfactory vendor for this serials category, except for
10-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had previously
been available on microfiche from Disclosure, Inc. Thanks to the advent of elec-
tronic full-text resources, EDGAR&Ograve; (SEC) filings are now available from a
number of sources including Dow Jones Interactive and Moody&rsquo;s Company
Data Direct. (A good discussion of the vendors that offer annual report assis-
tance appears in Judith Bernstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Corporate Annual Reports: The Commer-
cial Vendors.&rdquo;)6
</p>
<p>Yearbooks and Proceedings
</p>
<p>A related category is &ldquo;annuals, biennials, occasional publications, bound or
stapled, including yearbooks, almanacs, proceedings, transactions, memoirs,
directories and reports of societies and associations.&rdquo; Many libraries collect seri-
als in this class, especially academic, special, and large public libraries. The
more libraries that collect a particular society&rsquo;s or association&rsquo;s publications, the
more likely it is that a commercial vendor will handle a standing order for the
material. Although it is possible to secure some of these serials through a vendor,
there are a significant number that must be obtained directly from the society or
association. Again, this category normally requires setting up and maintaining
address and correspondence files, which is only slightly less labor intensive than
doing the same for annual reports of organizations.
</p>
<p>212 10&mdash;Print-Based Serials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Superseding Serials
</p>
<p>Two other labor-intensive collecting categories are (1) &ldquo;superseding serial
services (each new issue superseding previous ones, which are usually dis-
carded) including telephone directories, airplane schedules, catalogs, loose-leaf
data sheets, etc.,&rdquo; and (2) &ldquo;nonsuperseding serial services bound, sewn, stapled,
or loose-leaf, including bibliographic and statistical data.&rdquo; A library must ac-
quire most of the materials in these classes directly from the publisher. Super-
seding serials are important but problematic: important because people need the
correct or current information, problematic because they can be difficult to track
and sometimes to obtain. Airline schedules, current hotel guides, and other
travel-related serial sources have been something of a problem for libraries to ac-
quire. In the past, the publishers would sell the material only to qualified travel
agencies. As more and more corporations handle staff travel on their own, it has
become easier for libraries to subscribe to such services. In many corporations,
the library or information center maintains current travel information. In the
United States since the break-up of AT&amp;T, libraries have found it more difficult
and expensive to get telephone directories outside their immediate area. Finding
a reasonably priced and reliable source for these materials can be both frustrating
and time consuming. Free online access to some of these items may reduce the
acquisitions department&rsquo;s workload, if another unit handles Web-based services
that do not involve payment for access.
</p>
<p>Loose-leaf services are particularly important in U.S. and Canadian law li-
braries and accounting firms (examples are Labor Relations Reporter from the
Bureau of National Affairs, Standard Federal Tax Reporter from Commerce
Clearing House, and Ontario Annotated Law Reporter from Butterworths).
Proper filing and discarding of the material is of critical importance because in-
correct information can be very costly to a firm as well as to its customers. With a
loose-leaf service, the library must make certain that all sections released are re-
ceived. Another critical issue involves removing the superseded papers and mak-
ing certain the new ones are filed properly. Many publishers of loose-leaf
services make their services available through the Internet/Web, and some also
offer CD-ROM versions. Naturally there is a substantial cost for the electronic
versions; however, the library must consider the value of reducing staff labor in
filing the service as well as the greater assurance that what is available is in fact
correct.
</p>
<p>Nonsuperseding serials are less of a problem, and some are available from
serial jobbers. However, the materials in this class tend to be expensive, and
many must be ordered directly from the publisher. Indexing and abstracting ser-
vices fall into one of these two classes. All types of libraries need a few of these
reference serials. As the serial collection grows, there is an increasing demand
from users for more indexing and abstracting services.
</p>
<p>What Is a Serial? 213</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Newspapers
</p>
<p>All types of libraries, with the exception of elementary school media cen-
ters, collect newspapers, another serial category. Almost every small public library
receives the local newspaper and one or two newspapers from nearby communi-
ties. Large public and academic libraries try to have some level of national and
international newspaper coverage. Serial jobbers handle subscriptions to major
newspapers for libraries. Thus, it would be possible to place one order with a job-
ber, such as Faxon or EBSCO, for almost all the major newspapers from around
the world. At the time the order is placed, collection development officers must
establish the value of the newspapers&rsquo; content, in the sense of the demand or
need to have the latest issue in the shortest time. Acquisitions staff need to know
this so as to be able to place the proper order. For example, The London Times
can be ordered in a variety of packages, each with a different cost: daily airmail
edition by air freight, daily airmail edition by airmail (the most expensive op-
tion), daily regular edition by air freight, daily regular edition in weekly packets
(the least expensive option), or microfilm edition. The New York Times offers an
even wider variety of editions: city edition, late city edition, national edition,
New York edition, large-type weekly, same day, next day, two day, weekly
packets, microfilm, and others. Clearly, each variation has cost as well as work-
load implications.
</p>
<p>A number of the major newspapers are now available online, some from
online vendors (for example Lexis-Nexis) and some only through the publisher.
According to Wallys Conhaim, 600 daily newspapers (about one-third of the
U.S. total) were operating some level of online service in early 1998.7 Online
versions work well for many readers because the articles are not very long and
people are more willing to read short articles on the computer without wanting to
print a hard copy. Often, however, people demand good quality printing capabil-
ity for electronic journal articles because of their length or choose to e-mail cop-
ies to their home computers. If a library subscribes to a sizable number of
regional or local newspapers that are available electronically through a service
such as Newsbank, it may be more economical to choose this option. In any
event, choosing the electronic version would lessen the &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; (such as
checking-in issues and claiming missing issues) costs for the print versions held.
These costs can be difficult to track, thus making it difficult to know just how
much staff time the library will save.
</p>
<p>Newsletters
</p>
<p>Newsletters, leaflets, news releases, and similar materials represent yet
another serial category of major importance for some libraries. Special libraries
are the most likely to become involved in the ongoing collection of this class of
serial. Many of the items in this class are very inexpensive or free. Others, espe-
cially newsletters containing economic or &ldquo;trade&rdquo; data, can be exceedingly ex-
pensive. (There are a number of U.S. services that cost in excess of $20,000 for
quarterly newsletters of ten to fifteen pages. It is at that point that the difference
between the cost of the information and the cost of the package it comes in
</p>
<p>214 10&mdash;Print-Based Serials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>becomes evident.) Whether a service is free or subscription-based, someone
must put in the time and effort to identify the sources and get on the appropriate
mailing lists or enter the subscription. Libraries in marketing and public relations
firms are likely to be active collectors of this type of material
</p>
<p>Magazines
</p>
<p>Without question, magazines are the most common serials and the category
that most often comes to mind when one thinks of this material type. According
to Machlup&rsquo;s definition, magazines are &ldquo;mass-market serials.&rdquo; These are the titles
that almost any serial jobber will handle for a library. Machlup&rsquo;s magazine cate-
gories include
</p>
<p>&bull; Mass market serials, weekly or monthly news magazines (such as
Newsweek or Macleans);
</p>
<p>&bull; Popular magazines dealing with fiction, pictures, sports, travel, fashion,
sex, humor, and comics (such as Sports Illustrated or Toronto Fashion);
</p>
<p>&bull; Magazines that popularize science and social, political, and cultural af-
fairs (Smithsonian or Canadian Geographic);
</p>
<p>&bull; Magazines focusing on opinion and criticism&mdash;social, political, literary,
artistic, aesthetic, or religious (an example is Foreign Affairs or This
Magazine); and
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Other magazines not elsewhere classified.&rdquo; An example of an item in
this category is an organization publication (governmental or private)
that is really a public relations vehicle, sometimes called a &ldquo;house or-
gan.&rdquo; These publications often contain general interest material, but
there is usually some clearly stated or implied relationship between the
subject covered and the issuing organization (e.g., Plain Truth). Another
type of publication in the &ldquo;other&rdquo; category is the magazine found in the
pocket of airline seats. The publication contains interesting short articles
about people, places, and things. Many contain advertising, so the maga-
zine not only helps distract the nervous traveler but also provides an ad-
ditional source of revenue for the airline. Libraries may receive a
substantial number of house organs since their publishers give them
away. Vendors seldom handle this type of magazine.
</p>
<p>Journals
</p>
<p>Machlup similarly divided journals into four subcategories, with one cate-
gory divided into two smaller units:
</p>
<p>&bull; Nonspecialized journals for the intelligentsia well-informed on litera-
ture, art, social affairs, politics, etc. (Science and Equinox are examples);
</p>
<p>What Is a Serial? 215</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Learned journals for specialists&mdash;primary research journals and second-
ary research journals (American Indian Culture and Research Journal
and The Canadian Historical Review, for example);
</p>
<p>&bull; Practical professional journals in applied fields, including technology,
medicine, law, agriculture, management, library and information science,
business, and trades (RQ or Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine);
and
</p>
<p>&bull; Parochial journals of any type but addressed chiefly to a parochial audi-
ence&mdash;local or regional&mdash;(Kiva or Toronto Life).
</p>
<p>Most titles in these categories are available through vendors, although the
library must place direct orders for some of the more specialized learned jour-
nals. Most parochial journals must be purchased directly from the publisher; local
history and regional archaeological publications are examples of this class of
serial. Sometimes a library must join an association to obtain its publications.
</p>
<p>The final serial category identified by Machlup is &ldquo;government publica-
tions, reports, bulletins, statistical series, releases, etc. by public agencies, execu-
tive, legislative and judiciary, local, state, national, foreign and international.&rdquo;
Because this group is covered in Chapter 12, no discussion is included here.
</p>
<p>With these variations in serials in mind, it is clear why there is confusion
about terms and challenges in collecting and preserving them. Each type fills a
niche in the information dissemination system. Although they do create special
handling procedures and problems, they are a necessary part of any library&rsquo;s col-
lection, and the public service staff must deal with them.
</p>
<p>Unlike a monograph, a serial normally implies a long-term commitment.
Subscriptions require renewals, but with most vendor plans, the renewal process
is automatic, requiring no action on the part of the acquisitions department staff.
When the subscription renewal requires a positive decision by the library staff,
the serial holdings are more likely to reflect the current interests of the library&rsquo;s
customers. With automatic renewal, there is a substantial chance that the library
will continue to collect inappropriate serials long after they cease to meet com-
munity needs.
</p>
<p>A long-term commitment to a serial results in subscription costs becoming
a fixed feature of the budget. With rapidly rising prices and small budget in-
creases, each year serials take up an increasing proportion of the total materials
budget. Chapter 14 (on fiscal management) provides more information about
this problem, but in general, serial prices have been increasing at a much faster
rate than general inflation. Thus, each year the amount of money required to
maintain the present serials subscriptions increases at a rate greater than many li-
braries are able to sustain.
</p>
<p>Another fixed cost is processing. When ordering and receiving a mono-
graph, the library incurs a one-time cost. Serials have ongoing receiving and re-
newal costs, in addition to the cost of placing the initial order. Claiming missing
issues is a normal part of maintaining a serials collection. A staff member re-
cords each issue when it arrives in the library. When the person notes an issue is
</p>
<p>216 10&mdash;Print-Based Serials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>missing or a number skipped, the library contacts the publisher or agent to at-
tempt to secure the missing material. (This is called placing a claim.) Acting
promptly on claims is important because serial publishers print only slightly
more copies than the number of subscribers. Serial publishers know a certain
percentage of issues sent do go astray in the mail, and they print extra copies to
cover the expected claims. However, at times the number of claims is greater
than the number of available copies. When that happens, a number of unlucky li-
braries receive out-of-print notices. The closer the claim is made to the publica-
tion date, the greater the chances are of receiving the missing issue. (The
consequences of small print runs appear again when it is time to bind the volume
and the library discovers one of the issues is missing. Locating a copy can be
time consuming if not impossible.) Daily serial check-in is a must to avoid miss-
ing issues. Automated serial systems help speed routine serials work, including
providing automatic claiming, but in a library with a large serials list, one or
more full-time staff members may work exclusively on processing serials.
Clearly, each new serial adds to the workload on an ongoing basis.
</p>
<p>By their nature, serials arrive in successive issues, normally as paperbacks.
If the library maintains serials for long periods of time or the titles receive rela-
tively heavy use, the library must repackage the serial for more convenient han-
dling. One method is to store the loose issues in a cardboard or metal container
(sometimes referred to as a Princeton File) that keeps a limited number of issues
together in a vertical position. This makes it easier to shelve the loose issues
alongside bound materials. The container must have room on its outfacing side
to record the title and issue or volume number of the items in the box. The most
common long-term storage treatment is binding, representing yet another cost
for the library. Bindery operations are usually part of technical services and asso-
ciated with serials activities. (Bindery activities are addressed later in this chap-
ter.) A third alternative, microformat storage, represents an additional cost.
Whatever choice is made, there is an ongoing cost to package each serial year af-
ter year.
</p>
<p>An important consideration in serials selection is how end-users gain ac-
cess to the information each issue contains. Going through each issue is not effi-
cient, and few individuals are willing to do this. Many serials produce an annual
index, but this is of no help with current issues. An entire industry has developed
around providing access to serials. A variety of indexing and abstracting services
now provide services that assist in locating information in serials. Naturally,
most of these services are expensive and yet another cost of building a serials
collection. Although Harvard&rsquo;s Tozzer Library (an anthropology library) is atyp-
ical, it illustrates the nature of the problem. That library receives more than 1,200
anthropology serials each year. If it did not do its own indexing, the library
would have to spend more than $60,000 per year for indexing and abstracting
services to achieve only 83 percent coverage of its serial holdings. Tozzer&rsquo;s solu-
tion to the indexing problem is to index all the serials it receives. It publishes the
index as Anthropological Literature, which helps offset the indexing costs.
</p>
<p>When a library does not start a subscription with volume 1, number 1, the
librarian must decide whether and to what extent to acquire back issues or vol-
umes. Are backfiles needed? Some serial publishers have full runs available, but
</p>
<p>What Is a Serial? 217</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>most do not. Titles widely held by libraries may be available from reprint houses.
Backfiles are expensive, they may be difficult to find, they may require binding,
they certainly take up valuable shelf space, and many receive little use. Libraries
also cannot assume that vendors handling online full text serials will maintain
backfiles or make them available for all titles.
</p>
<p>Serials can and do change over time. New editors, governing boards, or
owners make major and minor shifts in the content and orientation. A major shift
in emphasis usually is well publicized. As selectors become aware of such shifts,
they can reassess serials. A title change is something librarians frequently com-
plain about, primarily because of internal concerns (see articles by Foggin8 and
Nelson9). From the acquisitions department point of view, a title change is yet
another workload issue. It is very important for cataloging and the OPAC that
there be a clear &ldquo;trail&rdquo; from former to current title. For some journals there is a
long history of title changes, which can be confusing for end-users who may not
know of the changes over time and may think the library has fewer holdings than
it actually does. We revisit this issue later in this chapter.

<p>Serials employ a different bibliographic network than that used by mono-
graphs. Few of the verification aids used for books cover serials. However, there
are several general and specialized guides to serial publications. Reviews of serials
are few and far between. Michael Colford&rsquo;s column in Library Journal is one
regular source of serial reviews. In the past, when publishers would supply sev-
eral free sample copies of a title for the library to examine, the lack of reviews
was not a problem. Every few years, Bill Katz and Linda Sternberg Katz compile
Magazines for Libraries.10 Today, many publishers charge for sample issues,
and although it depletes the funds for subscribing to serials and adds to the time it
takes to acquire them, it is useful to get sample issues before committing the li-
brary to a new serial.
</p>
<p>Four useful general guides to serials are Ulrich&rsquo;s International Periodicals
Directory (R. R. Bowker), available in print, online as UlrichsOnline at
http://www.ulrichsweb.com, or on CD-ROM as Ulrich&rsquo;s On Disc; Irregular
Serials &amp; Annuals (R. R. Bowker); Serials Directory (EBSCO), also available as
EBSCO Online at http://www.ebsco.com; and Standard Periodical Directory
(Oxbridge Communications), also available electronically as a CD or online at
http://www.oxbridge.com. All employ a subject arrangement, and entries pro-
vide all necessary ordering information. Bowker updates the annual Ulrich&rsquo;s
with Ulrich&rsquo;s Update. Standard Periodical Directory, which covers U.S. and
Canadian titles, has a reputation for providing the best coverage of publications
with small circulations, lesser-known organizations, and processed materials.
</p>
<p>Newspapers, newsletters, and serials published at least five times a year are
identifiable in guides like Gale Directory of Publications and Broadcast Media
(Gale Research), available online as the Gale Database of Publications and Broad-
cast Media at http://www.galegroup.com and Willings&rsquo; Press Guide (Thomas
Skinner Directories). For literary publications, consult International Directory
of Little Magazines and Small Presses (Dustbooks), MLA International Bibliography

<p>(Modern Language Association), and L&rsquo;Annee Philologique (Societe Interna-
tional de Bibliographie Classique).
</p>
<p>All of these guides, with the exception of the electronic versions, have
limited value in identifying new titles because they are annuals, which means
the information is at least several months old upon receipt. (As noted previ-
ously, serials change in a variety of ways&mdash;titles, frequency, editorial policy,
and so forth&mdash;and keeping up with existing titles is enough of a problem with-
out adding the need to identify newly created serials.) The best source of infor-
mation about serials acquired by both U.S. and Canadian libraries is the
Library of Congress&rsquo;s New Serial Titles (NST), which reflects data in OCLC.
The data in NST are the result of a cooperative effort called Cooperative Online
Serial Program (CONSER). As an illustration of the number of existing serial
titles, in 1981 there were 339,000 CONSER records in OCLC; by the fall of
2001 there were over 2 million records for serials in WorldCat. If the library
can justify the cost, online systems provide the most current information.
OCLC, BRS, and DIALOG are major sources. The latter two contain informa-
tion from Ulrich&rsquo;s. Such services are current, but costly, so acquisitions per-
sonnel must be certain that the speed and currency are essential. Some serial
vendors also supply directories.
</p>
<p>������� ��'&amp;��
</p>
<p>For most libraries, it is not cost-effective to place serial subscriptions directly
with the publisher. The amount of work required to monitor expiration dates,
place renewals, and approve payments repeatedly for each title is too great. In
any sizable serials collection, a few titles will be direct orders to the publisher;
however, if a library uses a serials vendor for most orders, there will be more
time for other problem-solving activities related to serials.
</p>
<p>Serials jobbers tend not to handle monographs, just as book jobbers tend
not to handle serials. Tend is the key word here, given the variety of serials; in the
area of annuals and numbered monograph series, lines become blurred and job-
bers overlap. Given the nature of serial publications, a library is better served by
an experienced serials jobber than by a friendly and willing book jobber who of-
fers to handle the serials list along with book orders. Many serials librarians find
it best to use domestic dealers for domestic serials and either an international
dealer or, if the number of titles from a country is large, a dealer in that country.
Choosing a dealer that can effectively handle subscriptions from other countries
can be a challenge. Libraries in the United States can turn to the American Li-
brary Association&rsquo;s International Subscription Agents: An Annotated Directory
for help. The publication lists agents and provides information about countries
and regions the agent handles, the types of material serviced, catalogs or listings
provided to customers, notes about special services (standing orders for mono-
graphs, for example), and name and address. Part of the challenge for vendors
handling international subscriptions is keeping up-to-date on currency exchange
rates and providing accurate information about expected price increases. It is ad-
visable to ask other librarians about their experience with the dealers one is con-
sidering. If the acquisitions staff cannot identify anyone using a dealer, they
</p>
<p>Serial Vendors 219</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>might start by placing one or two subscriptions with the dealer and increase the
volume of business if service is satisfactory. Another option is to join and moni-
tor an electronic discussion list such as SERIALST (http://www.uvm.edu/~bmaclenn
/serialst.htm).
</p>
<p>Service is what the library is looking for in a serials vendor just as it does for
book vendors. To provide service, a company must make a profit. How does it do
that? In the past, vendors offered discounts. Today, libraries generally pay a ser-
vice charge based on a percentage of the total subscription price. Serial vendors
have one minor and two major sources of income. One major source is the dis-
count publishers offer vendors. (Publishers offer these discounts because it is
more convenient for them to deal with one billing and ordering source rather than
with subscriptions from many individual subscribers.) Recently, librarians have
blamed publishers for rising subscription costs, but a few publishers claim that
vendors share the blame because they are not passing on a share of the discount
they receive from the publishers. Whatever the case may be, vendors depend on
publishers&rsquo; discounts to make a profit.
</p>
<p>The second major revenue source for vendors is the service charge they add
to their invoices to libraries. The service charge varies from library to library,
depending on several factors. It often requires a good deal of work to determine
just what the service charge is, in part because, when the subscription list con-
tains thousands of titles, it is unlikely there will be only one invoice, if for no
other reason than that prices change during the year and supplementary invoices
arrive. Sales representatives may not know all the factors involved in calculating
the charge and can give only an overview explanation. There may be various
rates for various types of publications; in part, the service charge depends on the
size of the discount the vendor receives.
</p>
<p>Another variable in the calculation of a library&rsquo;s service charge is what ser-
vices the library uses. Often, there is an extra charge for handling unusual serials,
such as government publications. The types and number of management reports
the library receives from the vendor also affect the service charge. Title mix is
another factor, just as it is with book jobbers. For serial vendors, it is more a mat-
ter of knowing which titles generate additional work for the vendor rather than a
bookseller&rsquo;s pricing concerns about popular titles (low price/high discount) ver-
sus scholarly titles (high price/low discount). If a library has a high percentage of
problem titles, its service charge may be somewhat higher than that of another
library with a similar number of subscriptions, costing about the same, but with
fewer problem titles.
</p>
<p>The setting of the service charge is an art, and the service charge is open to
negotiation. A good book on the acquisition aspects of serial work is N. Bernard
Basch and Judy McQueen&rsquo;s Buying Serials.11 A growing source of income comes
from a variety of extra services most agencies offer, such as automation pack-
ages, publishing and electronic services (CD-ROMs, for example), or custom
lists.
</p>
<p>What does the customer receive beyond the basic advantage of one order,
one invoice, and one check for multiple subscriptions? Automatic renewal by a
vendor saves library staff time, and when the invoice arrives, there is the op-
portunity to cancel titles no longer needed. Jobbers may offer multiple-year
</p>
<p>220 10&mdash;Print-Based Serials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>subscription rates that will save the library money. Notifying libraries about dis-
continuations, mergers, changes in frequency, and other publication alterations
is a standard service provided by a serials jobber. The jobber is more likely to
learn of changes before a library does, especially if the jobber has placed hun-
dreds of subscriptions with the publisher.
</p>
<p>Vendors also provide some assistance in the claiming process (missing is-
sues, breaks in service, and damaged copies). Several of the larger U.S. subscrip-
tion agents such as EBSCO and Readmore have fully automated serial systems
that libraries use to handle their serials management programs, including online
claiming. (Faxon supports a backfile service, SerialsQuest, that includes data
from libraries and dealers.) For libraries with manual claiming systems, most
vendors offer two forms of claims: one by which the library notifies the vendor,
which in turn contacts the supplier; and one by which the vendor supplies forms
for the library to use to contact the publisher. Assistance in claiming has become
more important in the past ten to fifteen years as popular market publishers in-
creasingly use fulfillment centers. These centers serve as a publishers&rsquo; jobber,
that is, a center handles a number of different publishers&rsquo; titles by receiving, en-
tering subscriptions, and sending copies to subscribers. (For such centers, the
mailing label is the key to solving problems; until recently, few libraries worried
about serials&rsquo; mailing labels.) Often, the subscription vendor is more effective in
resolving a problem with a fulfillment center than is a single library.
</p>
<p>Management information is another service serial vendors offer. Their in-
formation regarding price changes can be most useful in preparing budget re-
quests. (A sample of this type of data appears in Figure 14.1, page303).
</p>
<p>Other types of management information that may be available (at an extra
cost) are reports that sort the subscription list by subject or classification cate-
gory accompanied by the total amount spent for each group, or (if there are sev-
eral groups) a record of how many titles and how much money was charged to
each group.
</p>
<p>A good place to learn about the variety of services available, and who offers
which services, is at the national meetings of various library associations. For ex-
ample, representatives of most national serial vendors, as well as a number of
foreign vendors, attend the ALA annual conventions. They will supply more
than enough promotional material to fill a suitcase. Collecting the information
(including a formal request to quote), making comparisons, and talking with
other librarians about their experiences with various vendors is the best way to
go about selecting a vendor for a library.
</p>
<p>���"�����'��&amp;������
</p>
<p>Several major issues face libraries today in regard to their serials collec-
tions. Cost is perhaps the major concern (cost of subscriptions, processing, stor-
ing, changing value of currencies, and tight budgets). Another issue is the
delivery of serial information to customers without subscribing to the title by us-
ing document delivery or, as some librarians phrase it, &ldquo;just in time rather than
just in case.&rdquo; Related to document delivery are questions about copyright and
</p>
<p>Issues and Concerns 221</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>traditional ILL services; on a percentage basis, ILL does more work with serials
than monographs.
</p>
<p>Continued growth in the number of serials and their spiraling costs are two
issues of grave concern, especially for scholarly journals. Areas of knowledge
constantly are being divided into smaller and smaller segments; at the same time,
these smaller audiences want more information about the narrower topic. The
problem is illustrated by what happened at the journal department of Academic
Press, which announced one new journal, Applied Computational Harmonic
Analysis; one journal dividing into two parts: Journal of Magnetic Resonance&mdash;
Series A and Series B; and seven titles increasing the number of issues per vol-
ume. All these changes carried with them price increases.
</p>
<p>Costs of producing a special-interest journal will rise no matter how many
or how few people are interested in reading about the subject. When a journal
reaches a certain price level, the number of individual subscribers drops quickly.
More often than not, any price increase to individual subscribers only makes the
problem worse. Increasingly, journal publishers have adopted a &ldquo;dual pricing
system,&rdquo; one price for individuals and another, higher price (often double or tri-
ple the individual rate) for institutions (read: libraries). The publishers&rsquo; premise
is that an institutional subscription serves the needs of many readers, which justi-
fies the higher price. An interesting ethical question for librarians in general, and
acquisitions department personnel in particular, is: Is it ethical for a library to
regularly accept an individual&rsquo;s gift of a journal that has a high dual-rate sub-
scription? (Our view is that the library should not do that. If not for ethical rea-
sons, there are practical concerns about the regularity with which the person
delivers the issues as well as securing missing issues.)
</p>
<p>If publishers take the dual-pricing concept to its logical conclusion, they
will demand that libraries track the use of each serial and pay an annual service
fee based on that number. Or, as one occasionally sees in the literature, publishers
will make the title available only on a site-licensed basis. Before dismissing the
idea as unrealistic, consider two things. First, for years libraries subscribing to
H. W. Wilson&rsquo;s periodical indexes have been paying an annual service fee or
subscription fee based on the number of journals indexed to which the library
subscribes. Second, some countries, including Canada, now pay authors a lend-
ing fee for each copy of their books in a selected list of libraries.
</p>
<p>There are two types of journal price studies with which acquisitions depart-
ment staff should become familiar: macro pricing and micro pricing. Macro
information deals with subscription prices, rates of increase, and projections of
coming price increases. This type of data about the library&rsquo;s subscription list can
be obtained from the library&rsquo;s serials vendor. Information about overall price
changes appears in several sources for U.S. serials, including Library Journal
and American Libraries. One problem for many libraries is that information
about projected price changes appears at a time when it is of little help in prepar-
ing the budget request for the next fiscal year. The information may be useful,
but it is about a year behind the budget. That is, the library uses 2001 projections
for preparing the 2002&ndash;2003 budget request. (See Chapter 14 for more informa-
tion about budgeting.) What was clear at the time we prepared this edition was
that there is no relief in sight in terms of price increases. (One serials vendor
</p>
<p>222 10&mdash;Print-Based Serials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>issued an information sheet in late 2001 indicating that price escalation had not
really slowed. The vendor projected the 2002 increases in prices to range from
7.5 percent to 9.5 percent; perhaps this drop to single digit inflation will continue
even if it is at least double the general inflation rate. After almost twenty-five
years of double digit increases, the announced changes seem almost modest.)
</p>
<p>Libraries have been facing this pattern for years. Publishers don&rsquo;t under-
stand why libraries cut their subscription lists, and libraries and users don&rsquo;t
understand why the prices must rise by so much more than the CPI. Acquisitions
department staff are caught in the middle and often must attempt to explain what
is going on with journal prices, especially if the library must undertake a dreaded
journal cancellation project.
</p>
<p>Micro studies examine the cost of the information in the journal, number of
articles per volume, number of pages, page size, and cost per 1,000 words or
characters. Such studies are helpful in the retention and cancellation activities in
which more and more libraries must engage on an annual basis. (Finding micro
studies takes a little effort; one good article dealing with the subject and present-
ing some examples is by Barbara Meyers and Janice Fleming.)12 Not all pub-
lishers are pleased to see micro studies published, but such studies do provide
useful data for maintaining a cost-effective serials collection. The library must
use these data in conjunction with other information, such as local use patterns.
</p>
<p>For the most part, serials will continue to escalate in price, and budgets may
or may not keep pace. Clearly, serials will continue to play a major role in meet-
ing customer information needs, and likewise may command a growing share of
a limited collection development budget. How far can a library or information
center go in cutting back on the acquisition of other formats to maintain the sub-
scription list? Will switching to electronic sources for on-demand material really
help with the budget problem or just make matters worse? Answers to such ques-
tions vary from institution to institution.13 Electronic services and document
delivery may or may not be a viable answer. (There is more about e-serials/journals
in Chapter 11.)
</p>
<p>Robert Pikowsky has written a good article outlining the both the history of
journal price problems and the potential for electronic journals solving the prob-
lem, at least for academic and special libraries.14 Not surprisingly, he did not see
how e-journals would change the picture, and at present it appears he was correct.
</p>
<p>Many libraries and information centers face the problem of buying a jour-
nal twice, in paper and electronic formats. Even in a networked environment, it is
likely that some potential users will not have network access. Does the library ig-
nore these users and provide only the electronic version, or does it offer both ver-
sions? Libraries think twice about dropping the paper version because some
publishers (Biological Abstracts, for example) charge a higher fee for the
CD-ROM or online version if the library does not have a paper subscription as
well. Often, the higher fee is equal to the price of both subscriptions. Networking
the material also entails extra expenses, such as license fees, that can equal or
surpass the basic subscription price. Libraries should not expect to save money
by shifting from paper to electronic formats, unless they also shift some of the
costs to the users.
</p>
<p>Issues and Concerns 223</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Short of providing full text in electronic form, the library can provide docu-
ment delivery services backed by indexing and abstracting and table of contents
access in electronic form. (A summary of these services and their costs is an arti-
cle by Ronald Leach and Judith Trible.15 Although the specific information in
this article is outdated, the issues and considerations they raise remain valid.)
Commercial services, such as UMI&rsquo;s Article Clearinghouse and ISI&rsquo;s Genuine
Article, provide documents based on their indexing and abstracting services.
Newer services are based on the tables of contents of a large number of titles
(11,000&ndash;12,000). Subject searching is generally limited with the table of con-
tents approach; basically, searching is keyword in title. In essence, with table of
contents services, the user gives up depth of subject access for broader scope in
title coverage. Most table of contents services have also entered the document
delivery field. CARL UnCover 2 is the oldest such service, with OCLC&rsquo;s
ContentFirst and ArticleFirst, and RLG&rsquo;s CitaDel also available to users. As
with full text, there are a variety of charges to consider before the library can de-
cide to drop a paper subscription.
</p>
<p>As mentioned previously in this chapter, a significant part of controlling
serials relates to the constant changes that serials undergo. Dozens of new serials
titles appear each month, and the life span of many serials is very short. The
so-called little magazines begin and cease publication with great frequency, and
they often fail to notify subscribers of changes. Delays in publication&mdash;as long
as four and five years between the appearances of consecutive numbers&mdash;occur
occasionally.
</p>
<p>The most frequent change is a change in title, which is a constant headache
for everyone who deals with serials. Journals split into two or more separate
titles, and separate titles merge to form new serials. One title may be absorbed
into another; another serial may separate from yet another. A journal appears
with one volume and issue number; the next issue continues the same volume
number and the succeeding issue number, but the journal has a new title. Or the
new title may start the numbering at volume 1 again.
</p>
<p>One example of this type of title change is The Gale Directory of Publica-
tions and Broadcast Media, listed as a serials guide previously in this chapter
and also discussed in Chapter 7. This publication started in 1869 as Rowell&rsquo;s
American Newspaper Directory. In 1908 it was absorbed by N. W. Ayer and
Son&rsquo;s American Newspaper Annual, which started publication in 1880. In 1910
the title changed to N. W. Ayer and Son&rsquo;s American Newspaper Annual and
Directory, which in 1930 became N. W. Ayer and Son&rsquo;s Directory of Newspa-
pers and Periodicals. In 1970 the title changed again to the Ayer Directory,
Newspapers, Magazines, and Trade Publications, which became the Ayer Direc-
tory of Publications in 1972. In 1983 the title changed yet again to the IMS Ayer
Directory of Publications, and in 1986 to the IMS Directory of Publications. A
year later, it became the Gale Directory of Publications and in 1990 became the
Gale Directory of Publications and Broadcast Media; it could change again be-
fore this textbook is published. Numerous examples of this type of change can be
found in the Union List of Serials, New Serials Titles, and by searching on the
bibliographic utilities.
</p>
<p>224 10&mdash;Print-Based Serials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If title change is the number one problem in serials control, the second most
common problem is a change in the volume or numbering sequence without noti-
fication to the subscribers. For example, say the library subscribes to a bimonthly
title (six issues per volume year). Suddenly, after four issues have been received,
the fifth arrives with a new volume number. The library cannot be certain what
the situation is without contacting the publisher; perhaps policy has changed
with no notice to the subscriber; perhaps the library failed to receive issues; or
perhaps, as sometimes happens, the printer made a mistake.
</p>
<p>�� &amp;����
</p>
<p>A careful recording of invoice information is important in controlling peri-
odicals. When a publisher or vendor sends an invoice, it must be carefully exam-
ined both for the price and for the date on which the subscription is to begin (or to
continue, if it is a renewal, to avoid a gap of one or two issues).
</p>
<p>In the spring or at the beginning of a new fiscal year, the serials vendor of-
ten sends an extremely long invoice. This invoice must be carefully examined
item by item to verify that every element is correct. It is very unusual for an in-
voice of several hundred titles to be error-free: unwanted titles, incorrect prices,
inaccurate beginning or continuation dates, and so forth will appear on the list.
Correction of these errors is vital even though it involves valuable staff time.
Sometimes large libraries with many subscriptions arrange with the vendor to
have these long invoices divided into smaller chunks, perhaps by fund or even
with ceilings on the amount of money each invoice can total, for example,
$5,000 or $10,000 per invoice. This makes the checking process easier for the
library to handle and often means that the vendor will be paid fund by fund or in
increments instead of having to wait until the entire list of subscriptions is veri-
fied. Some vendors send price quotes prior to sending the invoice; libraries can
make their renewal and cancellation requests on these, thus spreading the work
out over a longer period of time.
</p>
<p>Some libraries have a policy of not approving payment of an invoice until
all of the problems relating to it are cleared up. If the library is dealing with a
vendor, who must in turn check with the publisher, that delay could jeopardize
the receipt of issues of all titles on the invoice. Other libraries are able to pay
the invoice if all appears to be correct and then receive a credit from the vendor
later if problems are discovered. Regardless of how a library handles pay-
ments, the invoice must be checked and corrected as quickly and as accurately
as possible, and errors must be noted and brought to the vendor&rsquo;s attention as
early as possible.

</p>
<p>Binding library materials is usually the responsibility of some part of tech-
nical services. Because serials are the materials most often bound by the library,
the serials department or the serials section of technical services often handles
this function. Some large libraries do their own binding, but usually outside com-
panies provide this service. Bindery work is a little like house painting: The
preparation is more complicated and time-consuming than the work itself. Be-
cause binding itself is a complicated and fascinating operation, library staff
should make an effort to visit a bindery to see the actual process.
</p>
<p>Materials preservation is an important element in any library&rsquo;s overall
service plan. A preservation program for a library encompasses many elements,
from building design to teaching the proper handling of library materials to users
and staff. The companion book to this one, Introduction to Library Public Ser-
vices (Libraries Unlimited, 1999), covers many of the preservation issues be-
cause they are an integral part of public service areas and activities. This book
focuses on binding and repair activities. The bindery unit usually handles book
repairs and the shipping and receiving of materials to and from commercial
binderies.
</p>
<p>Almost every library engages in minor book repairs. A torn page or a ripped
binding can be repaired by almost anyone. Improper repair methods can cause
more harm than good; using the right materials and knowing the correct proce-
dures are the first steps in a sound repair program. A good manual that explains
and illustrates basic book repair procedures is Abraham Schechter&rsquo;s Basic Book
Repair Methods (Englewood, CO: Libraries Unlimited, 1999).
</p>
<p>Knowing when to repair an item in-house, when to send it to a commercial
bindery, and when to buy a new copy takes training and experience. The amount
of expected use, type of use and by whom, the value of the existing copy, and
ease of obtaining a replacement copy all enter into the decision. In small libraries
the repair and binding activities will probably be spread among the staff. Some-
one in the circulation department is likely to be responsible for minor repairs.
Another person who works with serials will be responsible for sending periodi-
cals to the commercial bindery. When a book in the collection becomes worn, a
collection development officer may send it to a commercial bindery. Sometimes
a book is only available in paperback. The selector may decide that because of
expected use that the item must be hardbound before it goes into the collection.
In that case, the acquisitions department may become involved if the decision is
to acquire a &ldquo;prebound&rdquo; copy, that is, a copy from a company that specializes in
binding paperbacks. (Public libraries and school media centers often use such
companies because they are able to incorporate the paperback&rsquo;s colorful cover
into the new binding.)
</p>
<p>Usually large libraries have sufficient repair and bindery preparation work
to have one or more full-time staff handle the work. Having a bindery unit allows
the staff to develop greater skills and knowledge about binding procedures and
methods.
</p>
<p>Because of the variety of library materials that need preservation and
conservation, most libraries use several types of binderies. Typical bindery

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>operations handle large quantities of work&mdash;binding serials and rebinding
books&mdash;using modern production techniques. Binderies of this type are often
members of the Library Binding Institute, which gives a library some assurance
that the work will meet the institute&rsquo;s standards. The standards are jointly formu-
lated by librarians and binding company officials, who consider changes in tech-
nology as well as existing standards. At the other end of the spectrum are
restoration binders. These are individuals who attempt to restore old or valuable
volumes to their original condition, usually using hand-binding techniques. Such
work is expensive and normally reserved for items of special value. No matter
what type of bindery the library uses, binderies follow the library&rsquo;s instructions
about what should be done to an item. Thus, it is important for the staff preparing
bindery shipments to have some knowledge of what is possible and what the out-
come will be if they select a given treatment.
</p>
<p>Bindery preparation staff should know the differences between sad-
dle-stitching (sewing through the fold of a signature), side-sewing (sewing in
front of the fold; this produces a volume that does not lie flat when opened), and
over-sewing (similar to side-sewing but slightly more flexible; often used in
periodicals binding). A visit to a book bindery and regular reading of the New
Library Scene (a publication of the Library Binding Institute) will help staff
understand terms and appreciate the work involved.
</p>
<p>The bindery usually needs the following information about books sent for
rebinding: (1) the exact placement of the title on the spine; (2) the author&rsquo;s last
name, also on the spine; (3) the call number for the spine; and (4) the desired
color of binding. Each bindery has its own special requirements and ways of han-
dling material. Figures 10.1 and 10.2 are the bindery forms that the LMU library
employs. The form is typical of U.S. practice in terms of the type of information
supplied to the bindery firm. The staff person supervising the preparation of
bindery material definitely should become familiar with the routines of the bind-
ery used by the library.

<p>Serials, particularly periodicals, are a little more difficult to prepare for
binding. The check-in file for serials usually contains the necessary binding
information. Because serials are bound at regular intervals and over many years,
libraries attempt to keep the binding uniform for each title, that is, the same color
for the binding, the same placement of spine information, and the same typeface
and color of ink.
</p>
<p>A library should have the following information available for each serial
title:
</p>
<p>1. Frequency of binding and the number of issues to be bound in a vol-
ume (weekly, quarterly, monthly, annually, etc.).
</p>
<p>2. Whether the serial has a separate index that must be included in the
volume.
</p>
<p>3. The exact form of the title and volume numbers as they should be
printed on the spine.
</p>
<p>4. The color of the binding.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Exactly where the library keeps this information varies, but once a procedure is
established, checking to ensure that the binding was done correctly is a simple
matter.
</p>
<p>One policy question the library must decide is when to make shipments to
the bindery. With books this is not an especially difficult question; they can and
should go whenever the next shipment goes. However, with journals there are
several questions to consider beyond waiting for a complete volume. One is how
long to hold the complete volume if the journal issues a separate index or table of
contents for the volume. Sometimes it takes as long as six to nine months for the
index to arrive. During that waiting time, should the complete volume remain on
the open shelves? The longer issues remain unbound, the greater the risk that an
issue will disappear. As mentioned previously, locating replacement copies of
missing issues is expensive.
</p>
<p>A similar issue arises when deciding how many volumes should go into one
bound volume. Here the library must balance one type of cost against another.
There are three types of interacting costs. Most binderies have a basic price for a
bound volume of serials up to a certain thickness (2 or 21 2 inches or 5 or 61 2 cm.),
with additional charges as the thickness increases. They do not reduce the basic
charge if a volume is thinner. In some cases, with newsletters and quarterlies, it is
possible to bind two or even three title volumes in one physical volume at the ba-
sic price.
</p>
<p>However, just as waiting for a separate index increases the risk of having to
locate replacement issues, so does waiting for one or more additional volumes.
Annual volumes could remain unbound for two years or more. Libraries some-
times attempt to reduce the risk of losing issues by keeping the complete but un-
bound volumes in the bindery preparation area. When a user needs an issue, a
staff member retrieves it and signs it out. When the user returns the issue, a staff
member takes it back to the bindery area and puts it in its proper place among the
other unbound issues. This approach trades staff time and effort for money (the
cost of replacing missing issues).
</p>
<p>The library must also consider the costs to users when making the binding
decision. Binding more than one much-used issue in a physical volume is a dis-
service to the users. It may also increase the risk of people cutting out the mate-
rial they want rather than risking a wait while someone else is using a volume
that contains several issues. Having unbound issues of complete volumes paged
(retrieved by library staff from a nonpublic area) almost guarantees that the issue
requested will be available. If someone else is using an issue, the library knows
who has it and when it will be back, unlike materials kept on shelves open to public
use.
</p>
<p>How the library answers these questions depends on the local needs and sit-
uation. Having a closed stack (paged) section for all unbound serials can be effec-
tive. However, most users like to browse through many periodical issues, and
filling out forms for each issue is a source of irritation. Realistically, few libraries
have the staff to handle such a system.
</p>
<p>Another decision the library must make is when to send the shipments.
Most schools and academic institutions try to wait for slow periods during their
educational cycle. Thus, binderies tend to receive many shipments during the
</p>
<p>Binding and Repairs 229</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>summer and other times when there are long breaks at academic institutions. If
public and special libraries can avoid these peak periods, their bindery turn-
around time will be better. The bindery firm is always willing to identify periods
when the work volume is low because they want to keep their work flow as even
as possible.
</p>
<p>Bindery preparation requires a significant amount of staff time, and the
staff must understand something about binding operations. Careful record keep-
ing is a key to keeping errors and costs to a minimum. A well-planned and
smoothly functioning bindery unit is important to the library&rsquo;s overall purpose of
providing access to materials by preserving the collections.
</p>
<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>Serials are a vital part of any information collection. They are complex and
costly, regardless of their format. Cost is probably going to remain the primary
concern for some time. For the past fifteen years, serial prices have had dou-
ble-digit rate increases, higher than anything else a library adds to its collection.
Thus, serials continually take a larger and larger share of the materials budget,
unless the library begins to cancel titles and provide access to the information in
some other manner. Technology is changing the way libraries handle serials and
is making it possible to provide access to more titles. However, technology will
not solve the economic concerns of either the publishers and producers or the
consumers. How the two groups will solve the problem is impossible to predict.
It is likely the serials price problem will be present for some time.

</p>
<p>Almost all the issues related to print serials discussed in Chapter 10 apply to
digital serials as well. One reason for having a separate chapter on electronic ver-
sions of serials is that they are becoming more and more important to libraries.
There is no question about the popularity of such materials with library custom-
ers. They often prefer the electronic version, especially because of indexing and
abstracting capabilities. One advantage of the electronic index is the capability to
perform complex searches quickly, such as a Boolean search (that is, using com-
binations of search terms). Another advantage is the ease of printing or down-
loading the search results. Most of the serials that are currently digitized fall into
one of five of Fritz Machlup&rsquo;s categories (discussed in Chapter 10): journals,
magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and loose-leaf services.
</p>
<p>'�%�
����������
</p>
<p>Just as there are several terms used by individuals for paper-based serials,
so there are for the digital format: electronic journal, online journals, digital
journal, and the more all-embracing electronic resources. According to Thomas
Nisonger, there is no standard accepted definition of an electronic journal or
serial.1 E-journal is a reasonably short term and one we will use here to save
space. Producers take three broad approaches to e-journals: an electronic-only
version of a new title, an electronic-only version of a title converted from a paper
version, and both an electronic and a paper version.
</p>
<p>In the past decade or so, libraries and producers have struggled with how to
migrate from a print-only world to one that is a mix of paper and electronic re-
sources. The electronic side is becoming more and more dominant and will con-
tinue to do so in the future, at least in some serial categories. One of the first
forays into the digital world that is still widely used is the CD-ROM product.
Those CDs first seen in libraries were primarily DOS-based; CDs have since
</p>
<p>234
</p>
<p>��</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>evolved to a Windows environment. Starting principally with indexing and ab-
stracting services, the CD-ROM products quickly became popular in reference
departments. Proprietary software and differing search engines created and con-
tinue to create challenges for the library&rsquo;s public service staff. Stand-alone sys-
tems were satisfactory at first, but it was not long before there was significant
pressure to &ldquo;network&rdquo; the stations and allow users to select from a number of
products from any station. Making CD &ldquo;jukeboxes,&rdquo; network software, servers,
and user computers all work together was and continues to be a challenge for
libraries and acquisitions departments.
</p>
<p>When the producers moved into &ldquo;full text&rdquo; products, the issues of compati-
bility became even more complex. Naturally, more and more people wanted
more and more access, and variations in computer platforms and equipment be-
come increasingly complex. Full-text products were most often the result of
scanning printed pages. Producers then converted the scanned data into
bitmapped images and manufactured and distributed them on CD-ROM. Early
scanners had fairly high error rates and there was a step between scanning and
creating the bitmap images, where the scanned results were compared against the
original. All these steps took time, resulting in products that might be electronic
in character but were some weeks or even months behind their paper-based origi-
nal format. (This problem still exists, at the beginning of the new millenium,
with some Web-based products from e-journal aggregators.) Essentially the
CD-ROM products complement traditional paper-based ones, even if end-users
seem to have a misplaced faith that electronic products must be the most current
and complete. What they are best at is solving the problems of misplaced,
mis-shelved, and mutilated journals as well as &ldquo;at the bindery&rdquo; issues.
</p>
<p>Today, the move to Internet/Web-based products has helped to bring a bal-
ance to access issues. Up to a point, any &ldquo;authorized&rdquo; user who has access to the
Web will have the same access to a product regardless of the computer platform.
This assumes that all users have equal computer systems, which is of course not
the case except perhaps in a special library situation where all employees have
the same equipment. In the rest of the world, libraries have a few users with the
very latest high-end configurations, many with the current &ldquo;average&rdquo; setup, and
a fairly large number with rather old &ldquo;slow&rdquo; machines. Nevertheless, Web-based
e-journals and indexing and abstracting services do provide much more equal ac-
cess for end-users. Where the next stage in the migration will come from and
take us is impossible to predict with any degree of assurance. What we do know
is that, despite the advantages of electronic resources, print is still with us and is
likely to be so for some time to come.
</p>
<p>Hazel Woodward and her colleagues outlined what they called fifteen
myths about electronic journals.2 Although they based their article on research
they conducted in the United Kingdom, primarily at Loughborough University,
the myths they discuss are universal in nature:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals will provide better access to journal articles.
</p>
<p>&bull; Academics and researchers read journals at their office desks.
</p>
<p>&bull; Readers want electronic journals.
</p>
<p>Digital Serials 235</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals are quick and convenient to access.
</p>
<p>&bull; Readers know and care who publishes a journal.
</p>
<p>&bull; Readers want page integrity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals will bypass libraries and make them redundant.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals will save libraries money.
</p>
<p>&bull; Storage and dissemination of electronic journals is inexpensive or free.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals will save paper.
</p>
<p>&bull; Publishers care about readers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals will save publishers money.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals will make subscription agents redundant.
</p>
<p>&bull; Only recent issues of journals are required.
</p>
<p>&bull; All scholarly journals will be available electronically in a few years.
</p>
<p>To this extensive list we add several more &ldquo;myths&rdquo;:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals are always more current than their print counterpart.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals provide all the graphic materials of their print coun-
terpart.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals are always accessible.
</p>
<p>&bull; All readers have equal access to required computers at any time.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic journals will save library staff time and effort in handling
serials.
</p>
<p>We point out these myths not to suggest that electronic serials are unimpor-
tant but rather to note that they are not the final answer to the issues of providing
readers with access to the most current and accurate information in the most
timely manner. They certainly are an important step in the process, but as they
now exist, they are not the ultimate solution. Many of the myths exist because the
popular press and somewhat over-enthusiastic technology people promote the
concept far beyond its current actual capabilities.
</p>
<p>Librarians have, all too often, encountered the chief financial officer who
believes at least one of these myths, that electronic journals will save the library
money. We have not found that e-journals save the library money; in fact, they
add to the cost of operations, as they are almost always add-ons rather than
replacements. Several years ago the LMU library tried to cover the cost of an
aggregator&rsquo;s product that offers the full text of a large number of journals online
by canceling the paper subscriptions to the titles that would be available elec-
tronically. After one year, the library reinstated all but five of the paper subscrip-
tions because of the lack of full graphics as well as delays in coverage compared
to paper-based titles.
</p>
<p>There are a number of issues to ponder in the interplay between digitized
and paper-based serials. One issue is how to provide access. Digital serials, in
</p>
<p>236 11&mdash;Electronic Serials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>theory, are accessible anywhere, anytime as long as there is a connection be-
tween a computer and the database containing the desired material. Many cus-
tomers and technology supporters believe this is the ideal future&mdash;anywhere at
anytime. Library literature generally approaches this issue in terms of ownership
versus access.
</p>
<p>When a library subscribes to a paper journal, the library owns those copies
of a title for which it paid the appropriate fee. Electronic formats are often a dif-
ferent matter. Producers of the electronic material usually include with it a li-
cense agreement that limits the library&rsquo;s ability to use the material, which
normally states that the library has access rights only as long as the annual fee is
current. In essence, the library only leases the data. If a library has any responsi-
bility for long-term retention of information, leasing is a problematic policy even
if the producer says it will archive the files and the library will always have the
right to access them for the years for which it paid a lease fee.
</p>
<p>Without a doubt, digitized serials are a mixed blessing. They are very popu-
lar, they provide more flexibility in searching than their paper-based counter-
parts, and remote access at any time is a possibility. Although they do not reduce
library operating costs, they do present new challenges for the library&rsquo;s
staff&mdash;both public and technical services. Electronic systems can fail, as do
power supplies, which causes customer and staff frustration. Also, as anyone
who has spent much time with Internet-based services knows, &ldquo;electronic&rdquo; does
not always translate into &ldquo;fast.&rdquo; Waiting for files to download, to have the server
&ldquo;accept&rdquo; a query, or being abruptly cut off in mid-session are sources of frustra-
tion that do not exist with paper-based serials. On the other hand, torn out arti-
cles, mis-shelved or missing volumes, or finding the library closed for a holiday
are not problems with electronic serials (provided off-site access to the required
systems is available). Without question, e-serials are going to be increasingly
important in any overall service plan for any type of library. Thus one must
understand their benefits as well as their limitations.
</p>
<p>��,"����%��3�������
</p>
<p>Is the process of acquiring e-serials different than that followed for print se-
rials? The answer is no, not really; however, there are some additional steps. All
the factors that apply to acquiring paper titles also apply to e-journals. One factor
that differs is that often, at least in the case of journal aggregator services, the
purchasing decision is made in terms of a package of titles rather than title by
title. That in turn means the cost being considered is substantially higher than
any single typical library paper subscription. Thus, factors of new costs, vendor
support, and a &ldquo;package&rdquo; of titles are added.
</p>
<p>Another factor complicating the decision is that electronic resources re-
quire more staff involvement than is typical for paper-based additions. If nothing
more, there are questions about technology requirements and capabilities that
systems staff must answer. Furthermore, the public service staff must be in-
volved. Few users need assistance in opening a paper journal, but often need it
when locating and using an electronic title. Packages from either producers or
aggregators often employ different search engines, which in turn require staff to
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>remember which database operates in which manner. Thus, public service staff
often want a voice in deciding what, if any, new electronic products to add to the
service program.

<p>If a package, is it &ldquo;all or nothing?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Planned enhancements
</p>
<p>To her list we add cost per user, technological issues, and aggregators.
The two typical methods for securing e-serials are direct from the publisher
</p>
<p>or producer or from so-called aggregators. An aggregator is an organization that
develops &ldquo;packages&rdquo; of electronic serials. The aggregator enters into contracts
with a number of publishers or producers to offer their titles as a package. Pro-
ducers gain by not having to invest in as much marketing, programming, and
technology. Then the aggregator adds value to the package by providing a con-
sistent search engine for searching all the titles. Naturally, aggregators then add a
charge for their services on top of what the cost was from the producers&mdash;often
as much as 30 percent to 40 percent. Some of the large aggregators are OCLC,
UMI, Lexis/Nexis, and EBSCO.
</p>
<p>Using aggregator packages usually entails accepting a number, sometimes
a substantial number, of titles the library would never subscribe to in print. Few
of the aggregators allow a library to take only the titles of interest. Of course, that
means the library pays for titles it does not want. Thus, one question to consider
is whether the overall cost is really appropriate for the number of titles the library
does want. In 1999 the California State University System issued a Request for
Proposal (RFP) to aggregators to supply access to a list of 1,279 journals in what
they called the &ldquo;Journal Access Core Collection.&rdquo;4 The titles on the list were
those in highest demand in the system&rsquo;s twenty-two libraries. The project was
not as successful they had hoped. Several aggregators declined to respond to the
RFP, perhaps because of problems in being able to negotiate different prices or
the challenge of negotiating with over 1,200 publishers was too great.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>One system for evaluating aggregators as well as the publishers or produc-
ers of titles is the weighted system developed by the California State University
Libraries for deciding on systemwide purchases. They have a committee of
twelve members, representing the twenty-two campuses of the system, who
serve for two years. Evaluations are made independently by each committee
member, using the weighted system, during a two-week trial period. Results of
their evaluations are available on the system&rsquo;s Web page (http://www.co.calstate
.edu/irt/seir).

ada&rsquo;s Web site at http://collection.nlc-bnc.ca/e-coll-e/index-e.htm.
</p>
<p>Staff and customer &ldquo;comfort level&rdquo; with a chosen product is important.
Outstanding content in a product that is complex or difficult to use, even if the
cost is relatively modest, may not be the most cost-effective purchase. An un-
used resource is a waste of funds.
</p>
<p>Technical issues of network capability, stability, and compliance with gen-
eral standards are all key factors. Also, how much support is available from the
vendor and during what hours? If required, how is authentication handled?
Domain access&mdash;recognizing IP ranges&mdash;is a low-cost option for the library;
however, remote users with private Internet service providers will not have
access without special arrangements such as a proxy server. These are all new
issues for the acquisitions department staff to become familiar with to carry out
their purchasing activities.
</p>
<p>Content concerns relate to the usual subject issues and also to how complete
the material is, assuming there is a print counterpart. Another concern should be
whether there are &ldquo;additions&rdquo; to the product and whether they are necessary or
beneficial. Some vendors or producers will add some form of &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo;&mdash;
sound or video clips&mdash;to their material. Often this is of the &ldquo;gee whiz look what
technology allows us to do&rdquo; type rather than being a true added value. Such addi-
tions create hardware and software compatibility problems for both library-
owned and remote users&rsquo; machines.
</p>
<p>���'���%��3�������
</p>
<p>Handling e-serials? What does that mean? Unlike a print subscription, after
the appropriate record keeping files are in place, e-serials require more set-up
steps. Generally a new print subscription merely goes into its appropriate place
with the other current issues of the print journals.
</p>
<p>In the case of e-serials, someone must ensure that the technical issues are
addressed before implementing the service. If the access is Web-based and do-
main-restricted in nature, providing IP ranges is fairly straightforward. How-
ever, password verification is still a requirement of some systems, and libraries
must decide who will have access to these passwords. Will the library log in users
or will certain users (such as faculty members) be given the password to use as
needed? Testing to determine compatibility with other services needs to be done
(e.g., changes in hardware or software configurations). Libraries must also con-
sider what, if anything, will appear in the library&rsquo;s OPAC about the product. If a
package of 1,000 full-text journals is purchased, will the library add a note to the

<p>Handling E-Serials 239</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>holdings statements for titles the library also has in a print format? What about
entries for the &ldquo;new&rdquo; titles, even those that may not be important to the library&rsquo;s
customer base? Will the OPAC reflect just title, electronic address only, or both?
Will there be a &ldquo;hot link&rdquo; in the OPAC or on the library Web site? (More work
for the catalog department.) If images are included in the package, does the li-
brary need &ldquo;helper&rdquo; applications (such as Adobe Acrobat Reader) installed on its
public machines?
</p>
<p>Every library using electronic materials needs one person or office that han-
dles and maintains a file of license agreements. Someone must review the agree-
ment and notify staff of any new requirements. A good article outlining all the
steps and issues in implementing a new e-serial is Cindy Stewart Kaag&rsquo;s &ldquo;Col-
lection Development for Online Serials.&rdquo;5
</p>
<p>Janet Hughes and Catherine Lee published an article in 1998 that can serve
as a case study of the process of selecting, acquiring, and implementing a
full-text journal package. This case study addresses issues related to multiple
service points. The authors describe the process used at Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity and its statewide, twenty-three-campus system. They conclude by stating:
&ldquo;Overall, although the experience of implementing the first networked full-text
databases at Penn State was a positive one, its success depended upon careful
planning and dedicated inter-departmental and campus cooperation. These qual-
ities will be needed to make future forays into full-text equally successful.&rdquo;6
</p>
<p>(�����%
</p>
<p>As noted in the lists of myths, e-serials do not save either the producer or the
library money. Perhaps at some point in the past there was a reasonable expecta-
tion for such savings. However, by the mid-1990s it was clear to both vendors
and libraries that this would not be the case. For example, Robert Marks noted
that the American Chemical Society estimated its CD-ROM journals cost 25 per-
cent to 33 percent more to produce than their print versions. The reason for the
higher cost was attributed to the need to provide and maintain a search engine.7
Tom Abate has reported that the American Institute of Physics estimated that
providing both a print and an electronic copy of a title cost between 10 and 15
percent more than just offering a print version of the same title.8 Conversations
with publishers of electronic-only serials indicate that they see no difference in
costs&mdash;they claim it costs just as much for an e-only version as it does for
print-only. Janet Fischer of MIT Press indicated that the reason producers of
e-only serials see costs as equal was not so much a function of production costs
as of an overall loss of revenue: no back issue sales, no renting of subscriber
mailing lists, and perhaps most important, the loss of advertising income.9
</p>
<p>The dual pricing found with many scholarly print serials (that is, one price
for individuals and a higher price for institutions) continues in the electronic en-
vironment, if in a slightly different guise. Individuals do not face the same licens-
ing issues as libraries and do not pay for more than one user, nor are they asked
about number of potential users in the household or office. Libraries usually
have to pay extra fees, rather substantial at times, for more than one simultaneous
user license. Different producers use different increments, such as one to four
</p>
<p>240 11&mdash;Electronic Serials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>users at one rate, five to nine at another rate, and so forth, up to a rate for unlim-
ited access.
</p>
<p>Another pricing mechanism is by size of the service population, frequently
based on the number of full-time students or staff&mdash;full-time equivalent
(FTE)&mdash;at an institution. This is probably one of the most costly approaches for
libraries when it comes to specialized serials or other products. For example, say
a fictitious university (ICU with 12,000 total students and faculty) has an anthro-
pology department with 10 faculty, 68 graduate students, and 129 undergraduate
majors, and its course offerings each year enroll a total of 1,400 different stu-
dents. The library considers subscribing to an electronic version of a print prod-
uct in the field of anthropology that has a record of modest use. The producer
uses the FTE pricing model and indicates that its price is 50 cents per FTE. Un-
fortunately, typically the vendor calculates the cost on the basis of the institu-
tional FTE, not that of the department, or even a realistic estimate of the potential
users. Thus, if the institutional FTE (staff/faculty/students is the typical request)
is 12,000, then the cost becomes $6,000 for a product that has had only modest
use in the print format. Certainly there is the prospect that the electronic version
will have greater use, assuming the product comes with a reasonably good search
engine, but there is no reasonable expectation that every person at the institution
will access the database at some point during the year.
</p>
<p>Transaction-based fees are another pricing mechanism that can drive up the
cost of electronic serials for a library (this is the model that OCLC was using for
FirstSearch in 2002). In some ways, this approach is less costly than the FTE
model, as actual usage determines the price. One drawback of this model is that
the library is never certain what its costs will be until after the fact. With
FirstSearch, OCLC, at least for consortia, sets an annual fee that includes a fixed
number of searches. The fee is paid in advance, and at the end of the year there
may be additional charges if the search limit was exceeded. The amount may be
something of a shock for the library if it has not been carefully monitoring usage.
(The LMU library belongs to a consortium that purchased access to FirstSearch,
and members discuss what databases they can &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; to control the year-end
charges. Somehow it seems strange to be buying access to databases, then begin
to discuss which ones to restrict public access to in order to save money.) Part of
the problem with the transaction-based approach is that every search counts&mdash;
even those where the person has misspelled a word or does not understand how
to search the database. It is difficult to know how much value for money ex-
pended is actually received from this model. At least with paper formats, user
and staff mistakes do not cost the library additional money.
</p>
<p>Some publishers and producers have not decided which model to follow.
As a result, some offer free access to an electronic version of a title if the library
has a subscription to the print format. Others offer such access for a modest fee
(10 percent to 15 percent) above the print subscription cost as long as the library
maintains the paper title.
</p>
<p>Where pricing will go is difficult to predict beyond the fact that prices will
continue to escalate. As Bill Robnett has stated, &ldquo;The complexities of online
serials pricing may increase as more publishers enter the electronic publishing
market. . . . One consideration is that serials budgets will be redefined as libraries
</p>
<p>Pricing 241</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>purchase access in units of articles, an open-ended concept quite different from
the now prevalent subcription.&rdquo;10
</p>
<p>One probable direction for acquiring electronic products is through a
consortial process. The idea, which has worked for many consortia in the United
States, is that if the pricing model is FTE based, the larger that number the lower
the price will be. Certainly the group that LMU belongs to has allowed the li-
brary to acquire many more products than it could have on its own because of the
lower group rate the consortium negotiated. The downside for the acquisitions
department is that the process often is unpredictable in terms of products under
consideration and how much they will cost, if and when a deal is struck. This
makes for very difficult budget management and being unable to predict the
amount of money that will be available to purchase materials&mdash;even the elec-
tronic ones.
</p>

</p>
<p>Electronic serials are probably the &ldquo;wave of the future,&rdquo; but perhaps a more
distant future than technology enthusiasts would have us believe. Despite the ad-
vantages realized from having materials available in such formats, it appears
likely that there will be little prospect of either producers or libraries realizing
any cost savings as a result of migrating to an all-electronic environment. How
libraries will handle the ever-escalating costs of serials, regardless of format, is
something to ponder seriously. Electronic serials certainly do not reduce the
workload for technical services.

</p>
<p>Government information is available in a variety of formats, encompassing
all the types that libraries collect such as print and electronic books, sound
recordings, and maps. Government agencies (national to local) and quasi-gov-
ernmental bodies (such as the United Nations and World Health Organization)
are also the world&rsquo;s most prolific producers of information materials. These
materials are the least expensive to acquire, at least in terms of money. However,
they are often labor intensive for acquisitions and cataloging units.
</p>
<p>All types of libraries acquire some kinds of government information. Peo-
ple who have access to accurate information make more informed, if not neces-
sarily better, decisions. When it comes to understanding government actions and
processes, having free access to information is essential, if people are to respond
effectively. Further, as noted in Chapter 6, commercial publishers need to make
a profit on the majority of their publications. There is a vast amount of informa-
tion available that would not be commercially viable due to the cost of collecting
and compiling it; it also has a relatively limited sales appeal. Government publi-
cations fill the gap between no profit and no information.
</p>
<p>As James Madison wrote in 1832:
</p>
<p>A popular government without popular information, or the
means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy;
or perhaps both. . . . And a people who mean to be their own
governors, must arm themselves with the power that knowl-
edge gives.1
</p>
<p>As this statement shows, interest in and concern about society&rsquo;s access to gov-
ernment information has a long history in the United States. The issue of open
access to government information is a worldwide concern, and libraries play a
key role in the dissemination of such information.
</p>
<p>247
</p>
<p>��</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Government documents and information form a mysterious and frequently
misunderstood part of a library&rsquo;s collection. Because of their special nature,
these materials can confuse and frustrate staff and user alike. Yet they also con-
stitute an important, current, and vital part of any collection, and they can pro-
vide a surprising wealth of information on almost any topic. People use various
labels for this type of material, such as government publications, government in-
formation, official documents, federal documents, agency publications, legisla-
tive documents, and executive documents. Libraries house the materials in
several ways, ranging from a separate collection containing nothing but govern-
ment material to complete integration into the general collection. How the li-
brary houses these materials affects their technical service processing, from fully
to partially cataloged or uncataloged.
</p>
<p>Documents may be classified using the system employed for the other col-
lections or one designed by the national government for organizing its publica-
tions. In the United States, that usually means employing either the Library of
Congress Classification System, Dewey Decimal System, or the Superintendent
of Documents (SUDOCs) system. Libraries also handle access in several ways.
The materials may be included or excluded from indexes, card catalogs, and on-
line catalogs.
</p>
<p>To add to the confusion created by their diverse management, the docu-
ments themselves have only one common trait: Many are all official publications
of some government or international body. Thus, many have corporate rather
than personal authors, which makes it more difficult for users to know how to
search for desired material. If the material is included in an online catalog that
has subject or keyword searching, end-users will identify and use more govern-
ment information than they will if the material is cataloged in manual files. Gov-
ernment information comes in a variety of sizes, shapes, and media formats:
books, technical reports, periodicals, pamphlets, microforms, posters, films,
slides, photographs, CD-ROMs, online databases, audio recordings, and maps.
They have no special subject focus, because they are the product of many diverse
branches and agencies of government. They usually reflect the concerns of the
agency that produced them. Predictably, a document produced by the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture (USDA) probably deals with a subject related to agricul-
ture, such as livestock statistics, horticulture, or irrigation. The relationship may
be less direct, because USDA also publishes information about nutrition, for-
estry, and home economics. As remote as the connection may seem, most gov-
ernment publications do have some connection to the issuing agencies&rsquo; purpose
and function.
</p>
<p>Compounding the confusion about the nature of government information is
the fact that any level of government may issue an official document. Although
national government documents are frequently the only official publications
easily identified or treated as government publications, all other levels of govern-
ment&mdash;local, regional, state/provincial, national, and international&mdash;also pro-
duce official publications that are &ldquo;government documents.&rdquo; Although national
government documents are the most numerous and important in the library&rsquo;s col-
lection, other levels of government publications are also valuable and useful. A
</p>
<p>248 12&mdash;Government Information</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>library may choose to include only one type or level of document in its govern-
ment documents section, or it may include several levels.
</p>
<p>Defining what is government information is not always easy. Are reports
prepared by nongovernmental agencies (also known as NGOs&mdash;nongovernmental
organizations) but required by a government agency truly government publica-
tions? What about the publications produced by short- and long-term
multijurisdictional groups? Usually discussions of government information in-
clude materials published by the United Nations, which is clearly not a govern-
ment body in the usual meaning of the term. Rather, countries contribute funds to
operate the UN, including their information and publications program. We take a
broad view of this and, for our purposes, any information that has government in-
volvement, with or without direct government funds, is included in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The inherent diversity of government agencies and their publications com-
bines with the diverse library management techniques concerning government
documents to create bibliographic schizophrenia about government information.
However, this immense body of information, available at a modest cost, makes
government publications and services a worthwhile information resource, even
if they are a major challenge for both acquisitions and cataloging departments.
</p>
<p>The cost of government publications varies among the levels of govern-
ment and according to purchase plans or depository agreements. However, most
government publications cost very little. For example, U.S. law states that the
federal government may not make a profit from selling documents. The price, by
statute, may only recover publication and overhead costs. This can lead to re-
markable bargains for libraries. Where else can a library purchase a major refer-
ence tool like the annual directory of the federal government, which includes
names, addresses, organizational charts, and brief descriptions of the mission
and activities of each agency, for U.S. $30?2 Other levels of government follow a
similar philosophy concerning pricing and distribution of documents.
</p>
<p>Although price and subject coverage are attractive features, the variety of
target audiences of documents within any subject area also offers many advan-
tages for collection building. The USDA may publish information on nutrition,
ranging from bilingual pamphlets to nutritional research studies. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) likewise publishes a variety of
documents, ranging from space science for school children to extremely techni-
cal studies of space flight and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. Some
CD-ROMs issued by federal agencies include the Department of Defense&rsquo;s Haz-
ardous Materials Information System, the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s U.S. Im-
ports of Merchandise, and the Central Intelligence Agency&rsquo;s World Factbook.
Canadian federal and provincial governments and governments in other coun-
tries produce equally diverse materials and almost in the same volume as does
the U.S. government. Information about most subjects related to government is
available at a surprising number of reading and use levels that can serve the
needs and interests of most age groups. Perhaps the most attractive feature of
government documents is their timeliness. Frequently, they provide the most
current information available about popular topics.

</p>
<p>Some scholars suggest that society&rsquo;s right to government information, at
least in the English-speaking world, has its origin in the English Magna Carta of
1215.3 The U.S. Constitution contains the requirement that Congress &ldquo;keep a
journal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish same, excepting such
parts as may in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the
members of either house on any question shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those
present, be entered on the journal.&rdquo;4 By 1813, selected U.S. libraries were part of
a depository program that covered congressional materials. In 1857 the program
expanded to cover items produced by the executive branch. The &ldquo;depository&rdquo;
program grew over the next 130 years both in types of material distributed and in
the number of libraries receiving all or some of the available material. (The de-
pository program is discussed later in this chapter.)
</p>
<p>At some point, in small steps, the U.S. government decided that citizens not
only needed easy access to information about government activities but also to
information that would improve the economy or enhance daily living. How-to
publications, such as those on gardening and carpentry, became part of the
government&rsquo;s publication list. Thus, a second purpose of a government publica-
tion program is to help people improve the quality of their lives. As Bruce
Morton noted, &ldquo;The consumption of information, like the consumption of food,
is vital to the nourishment of the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness in a demo-
cratic society.&rdquo;5
</p>
<p>Some people question the role the government should play in producing
such publications. Morton summarizes the situation as follows:
</p>
<p>The first information obligation of the government of the
United States is to produce the information it needs to effec-
tively govern, and in so doing provide accurate information
about its activities for itself and so it can be held accountable to,
and by, its constituents.
</p>
<p>To accomplish this, the government, libraries, and the
press all must, and do, play important roles. The government,
however, is neither obliged (nor should it feel so) to produce,
let alone provide it, based on the needs of the researchers who
occupy the nation&rsquo;s libraries. One neither disputes the needs of
these researches nor their researches.
</p>
<p>Indeed, their needs are compelling, as is the need for gov-
ernment information in meeting those needs. However, it must
be understood that what is called government information de-
scribes not necessarily a source of information, but rather the
point of collection and data origination.6
</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 1980s, there were more than 1,300 U.S. govern-
ment document full and partial depository libraries. During President Ronald
</p>
<p>250 12&mdash;Government Information</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Reagan&rsquo;s first term in office, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) re-
ceived authorization to develop a federal information policy as the result of the
passage of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Public Law No. 96-511). The
OMB was given the responsibility to minimize the cost of &ldquo;collecting, maintain-
ing, using, and disseminating information.&rdquo;7
</p>
<p>One of OMB&rsquo;s initiatives supported the concept of disseminating federal
information as raw data in an electronic format, often without software for using
or searching for the desired data.8 Certainly OMB&rsquo;s role in shifting the emphasis
from paper to electronic means of dissemination has been significant. In 1996,
Congress began debating the Government Printing Reform Act of 1996; the core
concept of which was to provide easy access to government information by elec-
tronic means.
</p>
<p>A major problem was, and remains at the time we wrote this chapter, that
the necessary national, much less local, technological infrastructure that would
make the concept viable does not exist. Another significant issue was the lack of
governmentwide standards for making information available electronically. Ex-
perience in the late 1980s and 1990s with the electronic dissemination of U.S.
federal information demonstrated the necessity of a single governmentwide
standard. Some departments employ two or more software programs with their
various databases. Even the most experienced computer user has difficulty se-
curing the desired information. Very few individuals who want such information
have the skills to retrieve what they need without assistance. Realistically, until
there is a single standard, most people will have to depend on either their place of
employment or libraries to provide the needed assistance.
</p>
<p>As for the Internet, the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) is
a federal standard for describing information. However, even this &ldquo;standard&rdquo;
does, and will continue to, contain complexities for public service staff as well as
for end-users. The GILS consists of two basic elements. One is the centrally
maintained &ldquo;GILS Core,&rdquo; which is for &ldquo;general&rdquo; access to information. The sec-
ond element is the fact that agencies can and do maintain a GILS designed to
meet the special requirements of their primary constituency. Specialized GILSs
are linked back to the Core GILS, but there are a host of variations within GILS.
</p>
<p>The GILS provides for two search modes, intermediated and direct. It ap-
pears that the expectation, on the government&rsquo;s part, is that the intermediated use
will be through libraries, schools, and places of employment, or information brokers.
Direct users, according to the plan, &ldquo;must have network access, and be literate
in English to at least the secondary-school level, capable of using a personal
computer, and aware, if any, of limitations of their own hardware and software
environment (emphasis added).&rdquo;9 How many individuals are aware of what limi-
tations may be relevant or even what exactly is meant by the last clause?
</p>
<p>It is unlikely the founders of the depository system envisioned the federal
government becoming the country&rsquo;s largest publisher, or really debated which
documents should be available to the public. Today, there is a debate about what
information should be available, and the debate can have and has had some im-
pact on libraries.
</p>
<p>Background 251</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>From the library point of view, government publications still provide a
means of inexpensively expanding a collection. Given the range and content of
government information packages, all types of libraries can acquire useful, au-
thoritative materials at minimal cost. The Smithsonian Institution, for example,
is issuing a twenty-volume set, the Handbook of North American Indians. The
published volumes range in length from 700 to 930 pages, have extensive illus-
trations (maps, line drawings, and photographs), and have text prepared by lead-
ing scholars. Prices for the volumes range between $23.00 and $78.00
(averaging $39.43). As a rough comparison, the average price for the seventy-
eight Native American reference books listed in the 1997 and 2001 volumes of
American Reference Books Annual ranged from $16.95 to $385.00, with an aver-
age price of $155.89. None of the commercial publications matched the length
and overall quality of the Smithsonian volumes. Although the government did
not create its publication program for the purpose of building library collections,
this is a real, if unanticipated, benefit of the program.
</p>
<p>Staff members who work regularly with government information also be-
lieve that better and more frequent use of government material would benefit
most library customers. They believe that if individuals understood the broad
range of information and subjects available, usage would increase. Two factors
work against increased usage. First, in depository collections, the lack of full cat-
aloging for all received items means users interested in accessing such items
often cannot find them using the OPAC. The high volume of material received is
a major factor in not fully cataloging depository items. Even though the items in
the Monthly Catalog are now being listed in OCLC, the size of uncataloged older
collections keeps the old uncataloged system in place. Second, if depository
items are not fully cataloged, libraries normally establish a separate area to house
the items. Frequently the government documents collections reside in a corner or
basement of the library with the lowest volume of traffic. The old saying &ldquo;out of
sight, out of mind&rdquo; is all too true about government documents. To some extent
even the public service staff forgets to direct users to government information.
The forgetfulness is not only due to the location of the material but also because
of the difficulty in identifying appropriate material. This is true for both print and
electronic information.
</p>
<p>The National Library of Canada provides cataloging copy in its free
AMICUS service for all items chosen for depository. This cataloging is com-
pleted by the time these items are distributed.
</p>
<p>In nondepository libraries, government publications usually receive full
cataloging because the material goes into the general or reference collection.
This may be particularly true in special library collections, where government
documents are fully integrated into the collection alongside their private coun-
terparts. Undoubtedly many people in such libraries use government publica-
tions and never realize it. Thus, a government publication represents no unique
problem for users, if government material receives the same treatment as other
formats, that is, if it is housed in the general reference or circulating collection.

<p>U.S. Documents
</p>
<p>The executive, judicial, and legislative branches, as well as executive cabi-
net-level agencies and independent agencies, all issue documents. However, it
appears that presidential statements, reorganization plans, and executive orders
are the publications most users want. Sources used to identify such publications
are Code of Federal Regulations&mdash;Title 2 (President) Weekly Compilation of
Presidential Documents, and GPO Access (http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/).
Presidential commission reports belong to this class of publications, as do the
Budget of the United States Government and Economic Report of the President
Transmitted to the Congress. Such documents are valuable for academic and
general interest purposes, and most large and medium-sized public and academic
libraries collect some or all of them. School media centers may collect a few pub-
lications that relate to curriculum concerns.
</p>
<p>Cabinet-level departments (e.g., Department of Agriculture or Department
of the Interior) include administrative units, such as agencies and bureaus. Most
of these units issue reports, regulations, statistics, and monographs; many issue
educational and public relations materials as well. Some sample titles are Statis-
tical Abstract of the United States, Yearbook of Agriculture, Handbook of Labor
Statistics, and The Smokey the Bear Coloring Book. All types of libraries will
find publications of interest from the various units. Special libraries collect many
of the technical publications. Most academic libraries collect heavily in this area,
but media centers and public libraries are rather selective in their acquisition of
such materials. In addition to cabinet-level agency publications, many independent
agencies publish a similar range of items. The Tennessee Valley Authority, Federal
Reserve Board, and Central Intelligence Agency are examples of independent
agencies that publish documents.
</p>
<p>Cabinet-level and independent agency publications constitute the core of
the widely collected federal documents. Many departments publish general in-
terest periodicals that are very popular with library users. Media centers also find
these agencies a good source of inexpensive, high-quality visual materials.
</p>
<p>Judicial documents (aside from case law reports) are not as numerous as
those from the other two branches of government. The best known and most im-
portant title is the Supreme Court Reports, which contains Supreme Court opin-
ions and decisions. (Note: Private commercial publishers issue the decisions of
lower federal courts; these are not normally considered government documents.)
Although large legal libraries must have a set of the Supreme Court Reports,
other libraries may find them useful for patrons for historical, political, or per-
sonal reasons. As a result, many larger public and academic libraries acquire a
set for the general collection, even when there is a good legal library nearby.
</p>
<p>Congressional publications are second in number and popularity only to ex-
ecutive publications. In addition to the text of proposed and passed legislation,
these publications include materials documenting House and Senate delibera-
tions. Floor debates appear in the Congressional Record; assessments of the
need for legislation are available in congressional committee reports; testimony
</p>
<p>Types of Documents 253</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>before congressional committees appears in documents that bear the words
Hearings of or Hearings on; and there are also several important reference
books, such as Official Congressional Directory, Senate Manual, and House
Rules.
</p>
<p>The Congressional Record provides a semi-verbatim transcript of the pro-
ceedings on the floor of each house of Congress (semi-verbatim because it is
possible for a congressperson to add or delete material in the Congressional Re-
cord. Thus, it is not a completely accurate record of what actually transpired on
the floor of Congress). Many libraries, including large public libraries, find that
there is a strong demand for the Congressional Record.
</p>
<p>House and Senate committee hearings offer a surprising wealth of material
for libraries, because most hearings address controversial issues. The reports be-
come a source containing the pros and cons about the subject, as well as informa-
tion about what groups support or oppose proposed legislation. Often, the
hearings contain the first detailed reporting of topics under consideration in Con-
gress. Such hearings may have immediate general interest for library clients, and
they also are important for scholars of legislative history.
</p>
<p>Reports that accompany bills out of committee form another important in-
formation resource for libraries. These reports document recommendations
concerning the proposed legislation and background on the need for it. Often
these reports are central in interpreting the law after the bill becomes law.
Many of the current practices regarding copyright law are the result of inter-
preting such reports.
</p>
<p>Laws of the United States first appear as &ldquo;slip opinions.&rdquo; They next appear
in the chronological list Statutes at Large, and they finally are published in codi-
fied form in the United States Code. For most nonlegal libraries, the United
States Code is the more useful publication because it provides access by subject
and popular name, in addition to placing a specific law in the broad context of
other laws on the same subject.
</p>
<p>The Congressional Directory provides biographical information and cur-
rent addresses for members of Congress, plus useful information about the exec-
utive and judicial branches of government. It is a basic reference work, and many
libraries acquire it. Any library with patrons having an interest in the federal gov-
ernment or doing business with the federal government should have a copy.
Fewer libraries collect congressional procedure manuals, but these publications
do help the public and scholars better understand how the federal legislative pro-
cess works and assist them in following legislation of interest.
</p>
<p>Some collection development officers think of the special congressional
publication methods and formats in terms of &ldquo;all or nothing.&rdquo; Certainly it is pos-
sible and appropriate for many libraries to acquire all the items mentioned in this
discussion, plus many others. But it is also reasonable and possible to select one
or two series, such as Reports or Hearings. It also is possible to collect by sub-
ject, for example, all congressional publications about the elderly or Native
Americans. In many cases, especially in smaller libraries, it may be appropriate
to acquire only a few items of high local interest.
</p>
<p>Federal publications are an important source to consider for current infor-
mation at a modest price. It is not a matter of all or nothing, any more than it is a
</p>
<p>254 12&mdash;Government Information</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>matter of acquiring all or none of the books and serials on a given topic. Learning
more about federal publications and their content will pay dividends in meeting
the information needs of a library&rsquo;s community in a timely and cost-effective
manner.
</p>
<p>The Government Printing Office (GPO) home page (http://www.access.gpo
.gov/su_docs) allows searching the Monthly Catalog (the online version has the
shorthand title MOCAT) for recent publications as well as which depositories se-
lected the item. It also provides access to Pathfinder, which identifies govern-
ment Web sites as well as providing links to other federal agency home pages.
</p>
<p>Previously we mentioned that end-users face the prospect of losing their
favorite print publication as federal agencies move into electronic dissemination
of their information. Joe Morehead is one of, if not the, leading scholar of U.S.
government publications and their distribution. He wrote an article in 1997 about
the migration of federal periodicals from print to an electronic format, labeling
the electronic versions &ldquo;govzines.&rdquo;10 His baseline was the Congressional Infor-
mation Services&rsquo;s U. S. Government Periodical Index and information taken
from the University of Memphis Government Documents Department&rsquo;s Web
site, in particular its database of &ldquo;migrating government publications.&rdquo; In all,
Morehead discussed fourteen govzines. When describing The Third Branch he
noted, &ldquo;with this govzine (and others, especially FDA Consumer, encountered in
my cybersurfing expedition), the print version turned out to be considerably
more current than the electronic version, a refutation of a guiding Internet princi-
ple, the rapid access to information.&rdquo;11 (Some agencies, such as the General Ac-
counting Office [GAO], no longer automatically send out printed reports. It is
now up to the user to monitor the GAO&rsquo;s site at http://www.gao.gov, and either
download documents in Adobe Acrobat form or request print copies. This adds
yet another element to acquisitions departments&rsquo; workload.)
</p>
<p>An ongoing concern about electronic resources, both government and com-
mercial, is how permanent is permanent? Who will archive and assure continued
access to electronic information as operating systems, software, and hardware
change repeatedly? In classic Moreheadian prose, Joe Morehead concluded his
article by noting:
</p>
<p>It seems that while the GPO gets a grand makeover, the using
public suffers a bad hair day. To change the metaphor, the mi-
gration to the Internet and the concomitant extirpation of
print-equivalent sources will falter if it proceeds with the same
frenetic exigency exhibited by the thundering herds of wilde-
beest across the Serengeti plains.12
</p>
<p>State and Local Governments
</p>
<p>Several differences exist between U.S. states&rsquo; and federal information. One
difference is that there is still a very strong print orientation at the state and local
level. Certainly there is a movement to have more state information available
through the Web; however, it was not until 1996 that all states had a presence
there, and even then not all the sites were &ldquo;official.&rdquo; Very few states produce
</p>
<p>Types of Documents 255</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>audiovisual materials, which means state publication or information refers to
textual material, whether printed, mimeographed, or occasionally in
microformat or some type of electronic format. A second and often overlooked
difference is that states can and frequently do copyright their publications. Some
shared characteristics between state and federal information are diversity of sub-
ject matter, relatively low purchase price, and increasing difficulty in identifying
what is an &ldquo;official&rdquo; publication.
</p>
<p>Like the federal publishing program, most state programs now produce
materials mandated by law; that is, they record government activities and release
a variety of statistical data and general information about the state. Many of the
federal statistical publications are compilations of state data, which means the
most current information, by as much as two or three years, is in the state publi-
cations. The volume of general information and how-to publications from states
is low compared to federal output.
</p>
<p>Documents of state and local government agencies have limited availabil-
ity in most libraries. In the past twenty years, most states established or passed
legislation to establish depository programs that roughly parallel the federal de-
pository program. Those depository programs are a mixed blessing for technical
service units.
</p>
<p>Access to, and identification of, state publications is often difficult, and the
most comprehensive source is the Monthly Checklist of State Publications,
printed by the U.S. Government Printing Office, based on material received by
the Library of Congress.13 No one claims the publication is a complete listing,
but it is all that exists, and with the addition of a subject index starting in1987, it
is a useful tool for both reference and acquisitions department staffs. Some states
do publish lists of their new titles, for example California State Publications;
however, not all states do so. Two Web resources that help locate state and local
information are &ldquo;State and Local Government on the Net&rdquo; (http://www.piperinfo
.com/state/index.cfm) and Yahoo!&rsquo;s &ldquo;Government: State Government&rdquo;
(http://dir.yahoo.com/Government/U_S__Government/State_Government/).
</p>
<p>The Council of State Governments (http://www.statenews.org) has pro-
vided states with products that assist in governing. It also publishes items such as
The Book of the States and State Trends (based on fifty state surveys as well as
historical data). Most of their products are available in print, on disk, and online.
</p>
<p>Depository practices and requirements differ from state to state. The stat-
utes of any particular state will provide the frequency and the statutory frame-
work of the depository program. The state library can provide more detailed
information about its state depository program, including a list of depositories,
sales and acquisition information, and information about which materials are
available from a central source and which are available only from individual
agencies.
</p>
<p>Historically, the most effective method for acquisition of state and local
documents has been through direct agency contact. Like the federal government,
most state agencies produce and sell publications at or near cost. Often, compli-
mentary copies are available to libraries. One problem in acquisition of state
documents has been their short press runs, which results in state documents be-
ing out of print practically before they are off the press. Although state and local
</p>
<p>256 12&mdash;Government Information</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>agencies are usually willing to provide copies of their available publications,
they rarely accept standing orders, deposit accounts, and other convenient meth-
ods of library acquisitions. Usually, acquisition is possible only on a
case-by-case basis, which is time-consuming and frustrating. Frequently, the
only way a library learns about a timely document is through a newspaper article
or a user request.
</p>
<p>Privately published indexes provide some guidance. LEXIS-NEXIS
(owner of CIS Statistical Reference Index) contains state government published
statistics as well as national and international, and local or otherwise narrowly
focused, data with research value beyond the limited areas of coverage. It is
available in print and microfiche and as a CD-ROM titled Statistical Masterfile�
</p>
<p>and on the Web through CIS Statistical Universe. The Index to Current Urban
Documents (ICUD), published by Greenwood Publishing Group, offers both
bibliographic control of state and local documents and online access to PDF ver-
sions of the documents. Given the poor bibliographic control of state and local
documents, these sets, although expensive, sometimes offer the most cost-effec-
tive option for acquiring such publications.
</p>
<p>Local Government Publications
</p>
<p>In general, local government publications offer even fewer selection and
acquisition tools and less bibliographic control than do state publications. How-
ever, some major publications of special interest, such as long-range county
plans, demographic studies, or almost anything with local impact, get local pub-
licity. Often, inexpensive or free copies are available to local libraries. The prob-
lems of acquisition roughly parallel those for state documents; that is, no agency
mailing lists or standing orders and no effective acquisitions options (such as de-
posit accounts) are available. Furthermore, there is the need to negotiate individ-
ually with agencies to acquire reports and short-run publications. The strategic
problems are almost identical to those for state documents without the advantage
of the state document depository programs. In many communities, the central
public library becomes an unofficial local documents depository, and it may of-
fer support to other libraries seeking local documents.
</p>
<p>Collecting and retaining local, city, and perhaps county documents is rea-
sonable for a central public library and perhaps one local academic library. Col-
lecting from more than two or three local governments becomes expensive in
terms of staff time. Very few libraries attempt to collect from more than twenty
local governments, unless they are buying microforms through the Greenwood
Press program, in which documents listed in ICUD documents are available on
microfiche.14
</p>
<p>Bibliographic control of these publications is almost nonexistent, except
for ICUD. ICUD covers cities that are over 100,000 in population and does not
cover county publications. Very few cities or counties set up depository pro-
grams, and most do not have a central publications office. Tracking down reports
of various departments and programs is obviously time-consuming. Adding
to the problem are various short- and long-term associations formed of several
local governments. Where would you go to get a copy of the 1987 survey of

<p>visitors to the Monterey Peninsula produced by AMBAG (Association of
Monterey Bay Area Governments)? For that matter, how would anyone learn
about such a publication? We found our example in an article about the
Monterey Peninsula published in the February 1990 issue of United Airlines&rsquo;
magazine Vis a Vis. Local area documents can be high-interest items. They also
will represent the biggest challenge for the acquisitions staff to identify and secure.
</p>
<p>����'�
</p>
<p>Types of government documents in Canada are similar to those in the
United States. Canadian Government Publishing is the official publisher of fed-
eral documents (publications.pwgsc.gc.ca/pubindex-e.html). For many years
annual, quarterly, and weekly listings of federal government publications ap-
peared in book format. However, in the 1980s and early 1990s the annual and the
quarterly lists disappeared, leaving the weekly lists, which now are found both in
paper and on the government Web site (dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/search_form-e.html).
</p>
<p>Provincial governments also list their publications on their Web sites.
Many governments have bookstores where their publications can be purchased
or designate independent bookstores to sell their publications. Some cities, such
as Toronto, have arranged for the selective deposit of municipal documents.

</p>
<p>In many countries, the government publication program equals the U.S.
program in volume and complexity. The good news is that these large-scale pro-
grams generally have an agency, like the U.S. GPO, that is the primary distribu-
tor of the publications. Although dated, Cherns&rsquo;s Official Publications: An
Overview does provide a good starting place for information about the twenty
countries with the largest publishing programs.15 Very few countries offer a de-
pository program to libraries in other countries. Only the large research libraries
actively collect such documents because few users need the material.
</p>
<p>International documents, especially UN publications, however, do have a
wider appeal. The major source of international publications and information is
IGOs (intergovernmental organizations). An IGO may be defined as a group of
three or more member countries working together on one or more long-term,
common interests. Without doubt the largest IGO is the United Nations. NGOs
such as the World Health Organization also issue publications and information
of interest to a fairly large number of library users.
</p>
<p>The UN has an extensive publications program, and like other government
bodies is beginning to issue material in electronic formats. The UN Web site pro-
vides a broad range of information about the organization, including the UN
Publications Catalogue (http://www.un.org/Pubs/sales.html), which includes
ordering information. The site also has a listing of all UN depository libraries
worldwide. For most libraries that have some UN documents, the material is part
of the regular collection, circulating or reference, rather than held in a separate
document area, simply because they do not acquire very many titles.

<p>Another interesting source that few librarians are aware of is the UNESCO
Collection. This collection of representative works from various countries con-
tains more than 900 titles, most in English and French, and is available online
(http://upo.unesco.org). Each year, the UNESCO director and member countries
select the best titles in all genres from each country. UNESCO then underwrites
translation costs and selects a commercial publisher to issue the inexpensive edi-
tion. The following provides a sense of what the collection contains:
</p>
<p>[U]pcoming additions to the collection will include an anthol-
ogy of Ukrainian contemporary poetry in Spanish, complete
short stories of Gael Cortazar in French, an anthology of con-
temporary short stories from South Africa in English, &lsquo;memory
poems&rsquo; of America in Spanish, an anthology of contemporary
short stories by Turkish women in French, and new Albanian
poetry in English.16
</p>
<p>This UNESCO series can be useful to smaller libraries seeking to expand
their collections of international authors. Many of the authors included in the se-
ries are Nobel Prize winners. The series also saves the acquisitions department a
great deal of time attempting to locate such material on its own.
</p>
<p>In addition to the UNESCO collection, UNESCO also publishes some ex-
cellent reference titles, such as Statistical Yearbook, World Education Report,
World Science Report, and Study Abroad. Some other titles published by agen-
cies related to the UN are the International Labor Organization&rsquo;s (ILO) Year
Book of Labour Statistics, the UNICEF State of the World&rsquo;s Children Report, the

<p>The international document acquisitions situation has benefited from the
existence of UNIPUB, a private distributor that collects international docu-
ments, creates catalogs, and offers the documents for sale from a central facility
(http://www.bernan.com). This vendor offers a unique opportunity to build an
international documents collection from a variety of agencies; UNIPUB pro-
vides all the conveniences found in the trade book field, such as standing orders,
sales catalogs and subject pamphlets, deposit accounts, and a central sales office.
An important fact to keep in mind is that UNIPUB also handles many intergov-
ernmental agency publications, such as the International Atomic Energy
Agency, United Nations University Press, General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
</p>
<p>Like state and federal documents, international documents profit from in-
clusion in computerized bibliographic databases. Privately published indexes,
such as CIS&rsquo;s Index to International Statistics (IIS), are among the tools creating
some degree of bibliographic control and acquisitions assistance. As does CIS&rsquo;s
state and federal documents program, IIS offers companion fiche collections.
</p>
<p>As is the case for U.S. federal materials, libraries can elect to collect legisla-
tive, judicial, or executive materials from other national governments. Generally,
for legislative material, it is all or nothing for a particular series, for example, the
British parliamentary papers or France&rsquo;s Journal Official. Frequently, a library
</p>
<p>Documents from Other Countries 259</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>can acquire, in microformat, sets of retrospective legislative material from com-
mercial vendors or the originating government. Like that of the U.S. executive
branch, foreign executive branch material can be a challenge to collect. More of-
ten than not, it requires title-by-title selection from each agency, office, bureau,
or other entity. Standing order programs are few and far between.
</p>
<p>Although very few countries offer depository arrangements for libraries in
other countries, some do allow libraries to establish a deposit account. Variations
in exchange rates often cause problems about how much money is still available.
One method that works, if a library wishes to buy a substantial number of publi-
cations from a country, is to have a book dealer or vendor in the country purchase
the documents. This approach may result in a higher volume of acquisition than
the library can handle. There is a wide variation in bibliographic control, from al-
most total to nonexistent.
</p>
<p>Each type of document has its own place in a library&rsquo;s service program, and
each poses special acquisitions challenges. Depository programs offer free docu-
ments but may involve problems resulting from depository status requirements,
such as being open to the public. Or a library may not wish to assume depository
responsibilities just to acquire documents. This is especially true because there is
a wide variety of items available to nondepository libraries.
</p>
<p>"4�4�'�(&amp;��
&amp;�)���#���)�(�&amp;%��+
</p>
<p>The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) has a long history. It has
been successful in getting government information to the public. At the 1998
ALA convention in Washington, D.C., the GPO representative indicated that
there were 1,365 depository libraries in the United States. (Note: The number has
been declining over the past ten years because many libraries that were &ldquo;selec-
tive&rdquo; members dropped out of the program as collection space and staffing prob-
lems grew in magnitude and electronic resources multiplied.)
</p>
<p>There are two types of depository libraries, full and selective. A full deposi-
tory agrees to accept all items available to FDLP participants; selective institu-
tions take only a portion of the material. The selective libraries are encouraged to
take at least 15 percent of the items available&mdash;the depository program does not
include all publications issued by federal agencies and organizations. All the
items in MOCAT are part of the program, so locating an entry in that product
means it should be available at the closest full member library and might be
available at a selective member. (To locate the nearby members electronically,
access http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/findlibs/index.html). The GPO pro-
vides government information products at no cost (at least at present) to mem-
bers of FDLP. Member institutions are, in turn, required to provide local, no-fee
access in &ldquo;an impartial environment&rdquo; to the public, to provide professional assis-
tance in using the material, and to retain the materials indefinitely.
</p>
<p>The composition of FDLP is heavily weighted toward academic libraries
(50 percent), with public libraries a distant second (20 percent). The breakdown
of the balance of members is 11 percent academic law libraries, 5 percent com-
munity college libraries, 5 percent state and special libraries, 5 percent federal
</p>
<p>260 12&mdash;Government Information</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and state court libraries, and 4 percent federal agency libraries. The academic/
legal libraries dominate the program in terms of numbers. Many people view ac-
ademic libraries as intimidating, so increasing the number of public libraries in
the program might well increase usage by the general public.
</p>
<p>As the federal government moves toward increasing dependence on elec-
tronic dissemination of information, some people raise questions such as
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the FDLP still necessary?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the FDLP a remnant of the nineteenth century?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the FDLP really the best way to get information to people in the
twenty-first century?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is there a way to change the system to make it more cost effective?
</p>
<p>An article that explores the challenges facing FDLP is Patrick Wilkerson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Beyond the Federal Depository Library Program,&rdquo; in which he concluded, &ldquo;The
traditional FDLP is dead. . . . The new entity will be created to fill the country&rsquo;s
need for free and open access to government information in the twenty-first cen-
tury.&rdquo;17 However, Prudence Adler holds the alternative view, believing that the
FDLP &ldquo;has stood the test of time because of the role that it has played in promot-
ing access to government information, and in support of teaching and learning
and in stimulating economic development. That role continues and, indeed,
should be strengthened and reaffirmed.&rdquo;18 One means of doing so may be
through the U.S. &ldquo;Core Documents&rdquo; program currently underway, in which se-
lected documents are made available online (http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs
/locators/coredocs/about.html).
</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, all too often locations of separate government
documents collections are in low-use areas of the library. The primary issue is
not the physical location but rather integration versus separation of government
information and the general collections. In essence, intellectual access is the pri-
mary concern.
</p>
<p>One reason that integration of government material into general collections
does not occur is that few libraries have enough catalogers to catalog all the
books, journals, other media, and government publications, at least in those li-
braries on depository programs. Most of the depository collections use the Su-
perintendent of Documents number (SUDOC number) to organize their U.S.
document collection. A 1996 survey of private academic depository libraries
showed that 88 percent employed SUCDOC numbers.19 (The survey covered
285 libraries.) A service of OCLC called GOVDOC has helped to reduce this
problem:
</p>
<p>The service was created to enable libraries, whether they are
OCLC members or not, to rapidly but accurately catalog gov-
ernment documents without straining the budget or staff&rsquo;s time.
Each month GOVDOC will generate OCLC-MARC tapes or
catalog cards for everything distributed through the federal de-
pository program, e.g., posters, charts, audiovisual materials,
</p>
<p>U.S. DEPOSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAM 261</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and machine readable files. Libraries will then use a custom-
ized order form to select the materials they want.20
</p>
<p>The service makes integrating federal documents into the general collection less
of a problem, at least in terms of cataloging and classification issues.
</p>
<p>For the majority of libraries that do not actively collect government docu-
ments, the integrated approach is the only reasonable option and is the one most
libraries employ. If the library is a partial depository taking 25 percent or less of
the items available and there is no full-time public service documents staff, we
believe the integrated approach is best. (Note: The GPO expects partial deposi-
tory libraries to take 25 percent or more of available items, but many do not do
so.) Without the experienced public service documents staff, the separate collec-
tion is too often forgotten and vastly under-used for the shelf space occupied.
Undoubtedly, the large separate collection with a full-time staff will be more ef-
fective if the general reference staff remembers to direct users to it.
</p>
<p>As governments move toward ever-greater dependence on electronic for-
mats for the dissemination of information, the issue of how to handle print mate-
rials is less critical. Nevertheless, at least in the near term, FDLP members will
continue to receive a substantial amount of print material. Even when, or if, all
government information is available only in electronic format, there will be the
question of what to do with over 185 years&rsquo; worth of print publications. Thus,
there will still be a few challenges for depository libraries that relate to tradi-
tional formats.
</p>
<p>One obvious way to achieve greater utilization of government publications
is through the online catalog, even when there is a separate collection that uses
SUDOCS or some other system to organize its holdings. S. D. Zink has made a
strong case for this approach, while acknowledging the technical service con-
cerns.21 Perhaps OCLC&rsquo;s GOVDOC service will help alleviate the problems of
access to the content of government documents. With more libraries having on-
line public catalogs that allow patrons to search a variety of files using the same
search methods, patrons should begin to increase their use of government docu-
ments, if they remember to or can afford to add a documents database to the sys-
tem. An article by Daniel Blazek indicated that the majority of private
depositories had less than 25 percent of the depository titles in their OPACs.22
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the depository program is mandated retention. Adequate
collection space is a chronic problem in most libraries. One method for gaining
space is deselecting material from the collection. A traditional &ldquo;weeding&rdquo; or
deselection technique is to remove the lowest-use items and either store them in
less-expensive space or discard them. Government publications more often than
not fall into the low-use category, yet the depository may not be as quick to re-
move these items as they might be to delete low-use purchased materials. All de-
pository libraries must retain items for at least five years after receipt. Regional
(full) depositories must retain their collections, and selective depositories must
offer items identified as discards to the regional library and local partial deposi-
tories before discarding them. On the plus side, periodic reviews of the docu-
ments collection may also encourage a review of the general collection low-use
items that also occupy valuable shelf space.

<p>This discussion provides an overview of access issues in a depository envi-
ronment. A thoughtful reader may wonder about the costs associated with being
a depository library. A 1993 study by Robert Duggan and Ellen Dodsworth indi-
cated that the Georgetown University library expended $217,970 in direct, sup-
port, and overhead costs on its depository program.23 One can only wonder what
the costs would be in 2002, if such a study were done again. For smaller deposi-
tory programs the dollar costs would be much smaller, but we suspect that the
proportions of depository costs to total operating expenses would be very simi-
lar. There is no question that there are substantial dollar and staff costs associated
with depository status. For at least some selective depositories in southern Cali-
fornia, those costs and related issues caused libraries to rethink the value of being
a selective depository, especially in terms of technical service staff time and
steadily shrinking collection storage space.
</p>
<p>����'����'�(&amp;��
&amp;�)�(�&amp;%��+�
</p>
<p>There are forty-eight full depositories for Canadian federal government
documents in Canada, and one each in England, Germany, Japan, and the United
States. These libraries automatically receive all publications listed for distribu-
tion in the Depository Program in the Weekly Checklist of Canadian Publica-
tions for that week. Canadian public libraries and educational institutions that
have libraries open to the general public at least twelve hours a week and one
full-time staff member can become selective depositories. These libraries may
choose designated items from the Weekly Checklist. The National Library of
Canada provides cataloging records for all items in the depository collection.
</p>
<p>Canadian provincial governments also provide depository programs. For
example, Ontario only has selective depositories. Ontario used to publish a
weekly checklist but now publishes its checklist on its Web site (www.gov.on.ca
/MBS/english/publications) under the heading &ldquo;New Releases.&rdquo; Depository li-
braries make their selections from this list electronically.
</p>

</p>
<p>Libraries acquire government documents in a variety of ways. Some as-
sume the responsibilities of depository collections if they can. Others purchase
documents to match a collection profile. Some have standing orders through of-
ficial or commercial vendors; others purchase documents individually or acquire
most of their documents free of charge.
</p>
<p>Even if a library is a full depository, it will still need to acquire a substantial
number of documents in the traditional book manner, if it wants to have a reason-
ably comprehensive collection. Documents librarians have always known that
the system did not provide complete coverage. However, few were probably
aware of the magnitude of the problem. A 2001 report from the U.S. General Ac-
counting Office (Information Management: Electronic Dissemination of Gov-
ernment Publications) found that 50 percent of all the federal documents
</p>
<p>ACQUISITIONS 263</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>published in 1996 were not indexed, cataloged, or disseminated to the depository
libraries.24
</p>
<p>Of course, many documents are available free of charge from issuing agen-
cies and congressional representatives. They are also available as gifts or ex-
changes from libraries that have held them for the statutory period and wish to
dispose of them or from other libraries with extra nondepository copies. Another
common method of acquisition is purchase through the agency&rsquo;s official sales
program. The agency may or may not offer a standing order program. Some
commercial jobbers and bookstores do deal in documents, and some booksellers,
especially used or rare booksellers, may stock some documents.
</p>
<p>One large vendor of government documents is Bernan Associates of Mary-
land. Bernan Associates handles federal documents and offers several standing
order programs. Through UNIPUB (mentioned previously), a library may ac-
quire UNESCO, UN, and other international organization publications. One rea-
son for using UNIPUB rather than the UN sales office in New York is that
UNIPUB handles materials that the sales office does not, such as those published
by FACE and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Bernan Associates of-
fers several standing order programs.
</p>
<p>In terms of federal documents, only publications chosen for the sales pro-
gram are available from the GPO. These are documents that the GPO has
screened and evaluated for sales potential and public interest. The GPO produces
these documents in quantities sufficient for sale and adds them to the sales pro-
gram. The GPO operates regional bookstores as well as a sales office in Wash-
ington, D.C. through which publications in the sales program are available for
purchase. The bookstores exist in several cities, including Atlanta, Denver,
Houston, and Los Angeles; a complete list is available online at http://bookstore
.gpo.gov/locations/index.html.
</p>
<p>Libraries can order publications listed in the GPO&rsquo;s Sales Product Catalog
(SPC) from any sales office. GPO deposit accounts are available to minimize
purchasing problems. These accounts also apply to NTIS purchases, and NTIS
accounts also work for GPO purchases. In addition, the GPO accepts major
credit cards for purchases of GPO publications from Washington, D.C., or re-
gional bookstores. Items may also be ordered online at http://www.access.gpo
.gov/su_docs/sale/index.html.
</p>
<p>The GPO sales office offers a series of subject bibliographies based on the
current SPC, which is republished regularly, adding new publications and delet-
ing out-of-print items. The subject bibliographies are particularly useful as ac-
quisition tools for libraries that have particular subject interests or strengths or
for libraries with limited access to the SPC. The bibliographies provide patrons
with ordering information and an idea of the availability of documents that they
might wish to acquire. The GPO sales office also creates a series of sales bro-
chures and catalogs. These range from catalogs to fliers and are available
through the GPO sales office and bookstores.
</p>
<p>Some congressional publications, such as hearings and committee prints,
and a few agency publications, may be obtained by contacting the local or Wash-
ington, D.C., offices of congressional representatives. Obviously, this is not an
appropriate acquisitions technique for large quantities or standing orders, but it
</p>
<p>264 12&mdash;Government Information</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>can be quite effective for current issues or special subject publications. It is espe-
cially effective for acquisition of information about current legislation or infor-
mation covering a wide range of subjects. School and media centers should take
advantage of this source of free government documents. The best method for ac-
quiring recently out-of-print or nonsales publications is to contact the issuing
agency directly. The annual United States Government Manual provides a list of
addresses and telephone numbers for the major and minor agencies of the federal
government. Individual contact can produce copies of many federal documents,
often free of charge.
</p>
<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>Government information is an important element in any library&rsquo;s service
program. It is fundamentally important for society to have the information easily
available, even if people do not use it heavily. All types of libraries can acquire
useful information from government agencies at a reasonable cost. The idea that
private, for-profit firms would provide the variety and depth of information and
keep the costs reasonable seems naive. One only has to look at the cost of schol-
arly serials to see how privatization might affect the cost of government informa-
tion. However, securing and processing the desired material can present
significant challenges for technical services units.

</p>
<p>As noted in Chapter 3, one of the issues contributing to the &ldquo;more factor&rdquo;
for technical services has been the steady increase in audiovisual materials going
into libraries&rsquo; collections. Over the past thirty years, librarians and those who
fund libraries have become more and more accepting of the idea that libraries
should include nonbook materials in their collections. In fact, formats other than
print have an important role to play in providing the level of service the commu-
nity expects and wants. Certainly some libraries have had media collections for
much longer than thirty years. However, the advent of cable television, home
videocassette recorders (VCRs), cassette and CD players in motor vehicles,
computers, and the Internet have created an environment in which almost every
library has some type of nonbook collection. Although there are some individu-
als, both librarians and nonlibrarians, who agree with Will Manley&rsquo;s views about
videos in libraries, their ranks are shrinking. (Will Manley wrote an opinion
piece several years ago in which he suggested that videos were the &ldquo;twinkies&rdquo; of
library collections, expensive, draining much-needed funding from the impor-
tant materials, only attracting nonreaders, and creating more potential censor-
ship issues, and that libraries&rsquo; collections were unnecessary competition for
video rental operations.)1 Libraries have come to recognize that they are in the
information rather than just the book and magazine business.

<p>Books are useful only to persons who are literate. Depending on where in
the world one is, the percentage of persons who are literate ranges from 1 percent
to 100 percent. Throughout a large portion of the world, less than 50 percent of
the population is literate. Even in countries with apparently high literacy rates,
such as the United States and Canada, there is a difference between the reported
and the actual literacy rate. In North America, many people express concern
</p>
<p>268
</p>
<p>��</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>about &ldquo;functional illiteracy,&rdquo; which describes a condition in which persons may
have gone through the required educational system (twelve years of schooling)
but are unable to read beyond the level reached by the third or fourth year of
schooling. (In addition, many colleges and universities worry about the inability
of entering students to read and write effectively. There is a growing difference
in the United States between young people&rsquo;s ability to use and understand the
spoken, as opposed to the written, word.) Because of functional illiteracy and
numerous immigrants entering the United States and Canada, many communities
have established literacy programs outside the formal educational system. A
number of these programs operate out of, and with the support of, the public
library.
</p>
<p>For many purposes, textual material is not the most effective or most rea-
sonable method for conveying a particular message. For teaching, research, and
recreation, collections of graphic and sound materials are increasingly being
considered appropriate and useful. Some librarians still see these materials as
less intellectually important than print, or as &ldquo;toys,&rdquo; fit only for purely recre-
ational purposes, and they resist adding such formats to a collection. However,
as the number of people who have used multiple formats to learn about a subject
increases, so does the pressure to have all appropriate formats in a collection.
With each passing year, as multimedia computer systems combine text, graph-
ics, sound, and video clips, the distinction between books and nonbook materials
becomes less clear. Information that once was available only in printed formats
is now available in several forms, including books, microfiches, CD-ROMs, and
online. Book publishers, especially publishers of scholarly journals are, in in-
creasing numbers, publishing their material electronically. Many publishers ex-
pect to, and are, using CD-ROM packages to distribute reference material.
Almost all software mail-order catalogs include one or two CD-ROM packages
or online services of reference material. The Library of Congress is experiment-
ing with the use of laser discs (similar to DVDs) to store the contents of brittle
books.
</p>
<p>Primary school, secondary school, and community college libraries took
the lead in incorporating all formats into their service programs. In these library
settings existed an instructional aspect to media and the recognition that many
ideas are best expressed using a form other than the printed word. Further, the
media were integrated into the library&rsquo;s collection. Undoubtedly one reason for
this, at least in the case of schools, was the relatively small size of the organiza-
tion and the need to keep things simple. Why have two units, one for books and
magazines, and one for media, when one unit could handle the workload for
both? Unlike four-year colleges and universities, these institutions have a
long-standing tradition of using media in classrooms.
</p>
<p>In university settings, the pattern was to establish separate units to handle
media needs. Academic institutions tended to view media, essentially films, as
solely classroom material; even then there were doubts about their real instruc-
tional value. Some professors believed, and some still do today, that use of media
in classroom was the lazy person&rsquo;s way of not &ldquo;doing&rdquo; the teaching directly. Art,
film, music, and theater departments were exceptions, but they tended to create
their own departmental collections for the use of staff and majors.

<p>Why Nonbook Collections? 269</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Today it is not uncommon for a student to have an assignment to review
several scenes from Hamlet, requiring both reading the text and watching how
different actors and directors portray the scenes. In fact, faculty now make fre-
quent use of media both in and out of the classroom, and often assignments re-
quire the combined use of print and nonbook items. It is less costly for the
institution, as well as less time-consuming for the student, to have a single ser-
vice point. What has been happening is the integration of the two services, more
often than not in, or administratively part of, the library. Continued integration of
all formats will be what most people will demand and expect in the future.
</p>
<p>Public libraries were early collectors of sound recordings, and a number de-
veloped large film collections. Sound recordings circulated and over time ex-
panded from just classical music to all forms of music and the spoken word.
Motion pictures attracted groups for in-house showings, and were also available
for loan to groups such as scouts, churches, and occasionally schools. Today,
few libraries collect films except in a video format, and the number of public li-
braries with video collections is growing.
</p>
<p>Sally Mason, although specifically addressing public libraries, summed up
the situation for all types of libraries when she wrote:
</p>
<p>Clearly, the visual media will only become more important to
library service in the future. . . . It is not enough for librarians to
&lsquo;capitulate&rsquo; on the issue of visual media. We must become
leaders and advocates . . . helping the public to learn what is
available, to sort through multiple possibilities, and offering
guidance in the use of media to obtain needed information.2
</p>
<p>A 1998 Library Journal article on media services and collections in public
libraries indicated that many are acting on Sally Mason&rsquo;s statement.3 Between
1993 and 1998, media collection budgets grew by 53 percent, compared to just
36 percent for books (based on the 486 public libraries included in the survey).
Audiobooks are a major factor in the escalation of both demand for and circula-
tion of media resources. Like best-selling books, audiobooks can be leased by li-
braries. The major sources for leasing are Landmark and Brodart&rsquo;s McNaughton
Service (which also leases books).

</p>
<p>There are many differences between print and other media resources. How-
ever, six differences in particular have an impact on technical service activities.
Perhaps the most significant is that some type of equipment is necessary to use
most media covered in this chapter. One goal of media services is to make the use
of the equipment so simple that it is &ldquo;transparent.&rdquo; This means that users focus
their attention on the information presented rather than on operating the equip-
ment. In the past, using the equipment was so complex that some people refused
</p>
<p>270 13&mdash;Nonbook Materials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>to learn how. Now most of the equipment is easy to use, as long as all one wants
to do is play back the information. However, there are many &ldquo;flavors&rdquo; of media
equipment, which often means there are technical and equipment issues that
need to be addressed before placing an order for an item.
</p>
<p>The ideal OPAC should reflect the total holdings of the library regardless of
format. Thus, a subject search for &ldquo;Native American basketry&rdquo; would produce a
listing of books, journals, slides, videotapes, oral histories, and, perhaps, in a
museum setting, even some indication of holdings of actual baskets. One reason
for the separation of media and print formats in catalogs of the past was the result
of administrative and work patterns. Having a book catalog, a serials catalog, a
government documents catalog, a microform catalog, and, perhaps, a media cat-
alog was common not too many years ago.
</p>
<p>Another difference between print and media acquisitions is that there is less
bibliographic control or access to a number of media formats. Formats that have
a wide consumer base such as video and sound recordings have relatively good
access and control; others require the department to maintain labor-intensive
files of producer addresses and information about the firms&rsquo; policies regarding
discounts and order handling.
</p>
<p>A fourth difference is that on average media formats may be more expen-
sive than print materials. Media producers are also less willing to accept returns,
other than for defective items. This means that order process must be even more
precise than that for print items, especially in the area of technical elements.
</p>
<p>For some formats library staff need to preview the items before making a
final purchase decision. Although the process is somewhat similar to the ap-
proval plan for books, it differs in that it is usually a title-by-title process, or at
best, producer by producer. This takes up additional staff time.
</p>
<p>The fifth difference, related to the technical and cost issue, is that the field
tends to change rapidly, and today&rsquo;s &ldquo;in&rdquo; format is often quickly superseded by
some &ldquo;newer, better&rdquo; format. This leaves the library with a collection of items of
historic interest, but in so-called legacy technology that may be difficult to main-
tain, much less replace. Anyone with more than ten years of media experience
can easily name a few formats that have come and gone, such as the Beta video
format.4
</p>
<p>Finally, for some formats, especially videos, there are copyright concerns
about how the library may use the material. These &ldquo;performance rights&rdquo; are dis-
cussed later in this chapter.

</p>
<p>Media formats, like print formats, exist in a variety of sizes and shapes. Un-
like print, most media formats require special equipment or handling to gain ac-
cess to their information. Thus, a decision to add sound recordings to a collection
requires additional decisions about which type of recordings to acquire: CDs,
tape, sound files from the Internet, or all of the above.
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses only the most commonly collected media formats
and their implications for technical services. It devotes more space to video and
sound recordings because they are the formats that have had the greatest growth
and impact on technical services. Today, videotapes are part of almost all library
collections, and even special libraries are building such collections.
</p>
<p>Any list of current media formats quickly becomes dated as new technolo-
gies and new combinations of older forms appear. Just when librarians think they
have identified the latest developments and have decided to invest money in the
equipment and software, a new, even more exciting, and potentially valuable for-
mat is likely to appear. With this in mind, the following list provides a snapshot
of media formats of interest to libraries at this writing:
</p>
<p>&bull; Sound recordings (single and multiple track, CDs, and audiobooks)
</p>
<p>&bull; CD-ROM/DVD multimedia products
</p>
<p>&bull; Flat pictures (photographs, illustrations, original artwork, posters, and
the like)
</p>
<p>&bull; Maps (including globes)
</p>
<p>&bull; Microforms (all types)
</p>
<p>&bull; Mixed-media packages (kits)
</p>
<p>&bull; Printed music (performance and study scores)
</p>
<p>&bull; Slides (all types)
</p>
<p>&bull; Video formats
</p>
<p>Considering the range of material, and remembering the special aspects of the
media trade, it is obvious why acquisition of media formats presents a number of
challenges.
</p>
<p>Once a library decides to develop a media collection, how does the staff se-
lect and acquire appropriate items? There are four sets of factors to con-
sider&mdash;programming, content, technical aspects, and format&mdash;with criteria
related to each factor. The following section highlights major selection criteria.
These factors have implications for technical services.
</p>
<p>272 13&mdash;Nonbook Materials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Selection and Acquisitions Issues
</p>
<p>Programming Factors
</p>
<p>Programming (that is, use of material) is important in deciding what to ac-
quire. Many articles and books about this topic are available (see the Selected
Reading section at the end of this chapter). Programming questions include the
following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Will the medium be used in formal instructional situations, or is it only
for recreational use?
</p>
<p>&bull; Who is the primary audience: adults, children, or all ages?
</p>
<p>&bull; Will the item circulate, or will it be available only for in-house use? If
used in-house, will it be available to individuals or only to groups? Will
group use involve a library staff member or an expert in the field to guide
group discussions before or after the item&rsquo;s use?
</p>
<p>&bull; Will the library be a member of a resource sharing network? If so, will
the item become part of the shared material pool?
</p>
<p>Answers to these questions will affect the types of media purchased and the
price paid for them. For example, many videos for home use are less expensive
than videos for instructional use, even when both packages are the same title.
Anticipated usage will determine whether the library should purchase perfor-
mance rights. Although it is always possible to purchase the performance rights
after acquiring the item, it is not possible to get a refund of a performance rights
fee if it turns out there was no need for it. Thus, having accurate information
about what the programming expectations are at the time of purchase will either
save money (no unnecessary performance fees) or staff time (no paperwork as-
sociated with follow-up payments for performance rights).
</p>
<p>Content Factors
</p>
<p>Content is a second acquisition consideration. When reel-to-reel films were
the typical format, rather than today&rsquo;s videos, selection was a group process
rather than the sole responsibility of a selector. Today, with the prices of videos
dropping and increasing numbers of titles needed for the collection, the selection
process is more like book selection, that is, an individual process. The reason for
the group process was, and to an extent still is, that the cost of a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; in the
choice was more expensive for a library, and the cost was not always monetary in
character. School media centers still emphasize the group process, in part be-
cause of limited funds, but also because the possibility of someone objecting to
an item&rsquo;s presence in the collection is higher than in other types of libraries.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;preview process&rdquo; doubles the order work. First the library secures a
preview copy, which it normally returns to the supplier, then it orders a &ldquo;new
copy&rdquo; if the decision to purchase the title is made.
</p>
<p>Media Formats 273</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Whether selection is a group or individual process, using an evaluation
form is useful. Keeping the forms for several years, for titles rejected as well as
those purchased, can save both the selectors&rsquo; and acquisitions department&rsquo;s time
in the long run by not repeating the preview process. (Typically the acquisitions
department maintains such files.)
</p>
<p>Technical Factors
</p>
<p>Technical issues vary in importance from format to format, but some gen-
eral considerations apply to several formats. In most instances, judging technical
matters is less subjective than judging many other selection criteria. On the other
hand, it will take time and guidance from experienced selectors to develop a crit-
ical sense for these factors. Most individuals entering the field of library and in-
formation work are more attuned to good literature, well-manufactured books,
and the various methods of literary review and criticism than is the average per-
son. Although our exposure to television, film, and videorecordings may be
greater than to books, few of us have the background for assessing the technical
aspects of these formats. This fact is evident during film and television awards
ceremonies&mdash;the public interest is in the best film or program and performance
categories. It is the rare individual who can name the winners in the technical
areas (direction, production, special effects, cinematography, and so forth).
</p>
<p>Technical issues are a factor for acquisitions staff both at the time of pur-
chase&mdash;being certain to specify critical components&mdash;as well as upon receipt in
order to determine that the material matches the order. There is a surprising
amount of &ldquo;defective&rdquo; media shipped compared to print materials.
</p>
<p>Format Factors
</p>
<p>Format issues also drive (or should influence) the acquisition decision.
Questions to consider about format follow:
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the format the best one for the stated purposes of the producer?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the format the least expensive of those that are appropriate for the con-
tent?
</p>
<p>&bull; Will the carrier medium (the base material that supports the image or
sound layer) stand up to the amount and type of use that library patrons
would give it?
</p>
<p>&bull; If damage occurs, can it be repaired (locally or by the producer), or must
one buy a replacement copy? Does it require maintenance, and if so,
what kind?
</p>
<p>&bull; What are the equipment requirements to use the medium? How portable
is the equipment, and how heavy? What measures are needed to secure
the equipment from theft or tampering?
</p>
<p>274 13&mdash;Nonbook Materials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>These factors do not have much impact on technical services. However, it is
useful for the staff to know what types of equipment the library owns so as to
catch obvious mistakes in a request that would require equipment the library
doesn&rsquo;t have.
</p>
<p>Microforms
</p>
<p>The question often arises, Where do microformats belong&mdash;with books or
with nonbook materials? The answer is, probably in both places. Most of the
guides to microform materials cover microfilms and microfiches that contain
previously published information. It is rare for a microformat title to contain
original (new) material. One major exception to this is technical reports, which
may be available only in microform.
</p>
<p>Microforms are also a means of access to primary research material or to
items that are very rare and may only be available, in their original form, in one
or two libraries in the world. Thus, while many librarians and most of the public
view microforms with some degree, or a great deal, of displeasure, they do serve
a useful function in providing access to materials that might not otherwise be
available locally. These are often only available as expensive sets.
</p>
<p>Another reason for using microformats is to save space, especially with
low-use backfiles of serials. (As discussed in Chapter 10, a backfile or back run
is a set of older volumes of a current serial subscription. For example, if a li-
brary&rsquo;s current issues of Newsweek begin with volume 92, then volumes 1
through 91 are the backfile for that library&rsquo;s Newsweek collection.) When a li-
brary has long runs of low-use material, it wastes valuable shelf space by keep-
ing the physical volumes in the library. A serial that occupies several hundred
feet of shelving may be reduced to less than a foot of space when converted to a
microformat. Naturally, there is a trade-off in space; the more material there is in
microformat, the more equipment the library needs to meet user demand. Some
serial librarians use a microformat for backfiles of popular titles that have a high
incidence of mutilation or a habit of disappearing. If the library has a
reader-printer (a device that allows a person to read the microform and to push a
button to receive a hard copy of the page on the screen), loss and mutilation rates
tend to drop.
</p>
<p>One major drawback to using microforms to any major degree is user resis-
tance. Many persons claim that they cannot read anything in a microformat, that
it gives them headaches and causes eyestrain and other problems. Occasionally,
someone will complain that reading microformats causes nausea. However,
many individuals are able to use the material without such problems. Admit-
tedly, it takes time to get used to using microforms; it is more difficult in some
formats, such as reels, to locate a specific portion of text than in the traditional
book format. Without proper maintenance, the image quality will be poor, and
that will cause eyestrain. Equipment breaks down and malfunctions at times,
causing user and staff frustration.
</p>
<p>Media Formats 275</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Because individuals dislike reading material in microform, and to meet the
need to have paper copies of sections of the material, libraries have provided
&ldquo;reader/printers.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the paper copy is often little better than what
appears on the reader screen. Today, digital technology can resolve the print
quality issue, if the library can afford the equipment. Several reader/printer man-
ufacturers offer a digital system that combines the microform reader with a com-
puter and printer. The result is almost laser quality prints that are especially
welcome for photographs and other graphic images. LMU library was able to
secure such a system&mdash;the result of the purchase of a substantial collection of
journal backfiles&mdash;to save shelf space. Users now wait to use that machine rather
than the older reader/printers. These systems can handle either positive or nega-
tive films.
</p>
<p>Two guides to in-print microformats are Guide to Microforms in Print
(K. G. Saur) and National Register of Microform Masters (Library of Congress).
There is also the Online National Register of Microforms Masters, which is the
largest file of microform masters in the United States. (This source saves time
and unnecessary duplication when a library is thinking about converting some
material to a microformat that it holds, or in searching for out-of-print items.)
Both titles try to be international in scope, include both commercial and noncom-
mercial sources of supply (for example, libraries and historical associations),
and cover more than sixteen types of microformats. (The latter information
clearly shows the variations within a single format as well as why &ldquo;technical&rdquo; is-
sues become significant in the ordering process.) The National Register includes
only U.S. suppliers, but the material available is international in scope. Micro-
form Market Place (Microform Review) is an international directory of micro-
publishing, which includes microform jobbers. A major source of reviews of
microform series, both current and retrospective, is Microform &amp; Imaging Re-
view (K. G. Saur). UMI publishes two very useful catalogs&mdash;Newspapers in Micro-
form (covering more than 7,000 titles) and Serials in Microform (covering
20,000 titles)&mdash;and offers a useful back/missing issues service for many of the
serial titles. Major producers offer extensive catalogs of what they have avail-
able. It is necessary to keep a file of their catalogs, because it is even less com-
mon for micropublishers than for book publishers to contribute information to
the in-print guides.
</p>
<p>The two most common microform formats in libraries are reels and fiche.
Reel formats are the older of the two and are still widely used for newspapers and
serials. Reel microfilms are long strips of film on the appropriate size reel and
come in several sizes: 16, 35, and 70 mm. The film can be positive (clear with
black text) or negative (dark with white text). Most libraries try to confine the
microfilm collection to one or two sizes (35 mm and 70 mm) and one type (posi-
tive). With any large-scale collection, however, more variety is inevitable, be-
cause the information needed by the library is only available in a particular size
and type of microfilm. The choice is often either not to get the information or to
accept yet another variation in format.
</p>
<p>276 13&mdash;Nonbook Materials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Microfiches are sheets of film with the images of the original document ar-
ranged in columns and rows. Fiche is typically employed with materials that are
likely to have many people needing access at the same time or with multiple
means of access. The COM (computer output microfiche, a common format in
the recent past) catalog is an example of both these qualities. Although it is possible
to reduce a large card catalog of fifteen to twenty full reels of 70 mm microfilm,
it would also mean that only fifteen to twenty people could consult the material at
any one time. Fiche can be a great space-saving device while providing much
greater access by breaking up the file into smaller units, somewhat like drawers
in the card catalog. A microfiche with headers legible to the unassisted eye is
particularly useful. Such legible titling helps individuals to quickly locate the de-
sired material as well as helping the staff keep the fiches in order. The most use-
ful headers are those with numbers and that use different colors to distinguish
content (for example, a COM catalog with white headers for author entries, blue
for title entries, and yellow for subject entries).
</p>
<p>Like many other media, microfiche comes in a variety of sizes as well as re-
duction ratios. Common sizes are 3 by 5 inches (ca. 8 x 13 cm.), 3 by 6 inches (ca.
8 x 15 cm.), and 6 by 7 inches (ca. 15 x 18 cm.); reduction ratios range from 12 to
over 200. The greater the reduction ratio, the more information the producer can
fit on a single fiche. An item marked 10x means the image is 1/10 the size of the
original. Currently, producers use five categories of reduction: low (up to 15x),
medium (16&ndash;30x), high (31&ndash;60x), very high (61&ndash;90x), and ultra high (greater
than 90x). Reduction ratios are important to note because the user must, in most
cases, change lenses in the reader when using microforms at various reduction
ratios. Most microform collections contain materials produced using various re-
duction ratios.
</p>
<p>Libraries also try to limit the variation in fiche size and reduction ratios but,
as with microfilm, a variety of types is inevitable. Lacking an accepted standard,
commercial vendors select the size and ratio most convenient for them, and per-
haps increase their income if they produce enough material that libraries believe
they must own.
</p>
<p>Another concern is whether the film treatment is silver halide, diazo, or ve-
sicular. The latter two are less expensive but have relatively short shelf lives,
even with good storage and handling conditions. Silver halide, though more ex-
pensive, is the option to choose when there is a choice and long-term retention is
an issue. A related issue is the polarity of the film (positive or negative). A nega-
tive film produces a black image on a white background (the traditional image
people expect) in hard copy. Some of the more expensive reader/printers auto-
matically produce the traditional image, regardless of polarity, and most require
the user to select the film&rsquo;s polarity before printing. Ordering the correct treat-
ment is often critical, as frequently microform sets are produced on demand
rather than supplied from existing stock. In such cases, there is no returning a
&ldquo;mistake in the order.&rdquo; When the wrong treatment is ordered the library accepts
the mistake rather than paying for another set done with the desired treatment.
Naturally this does not apply to a mistake on the part of the vendor.
</p>
<p>Media Formats 277</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Videorecordings
</p>
<p>One of the challenges for acquisitions departments ordering media is the
fact many producers are small and only sell direct; there are few jobbers of me-
dia. In some cases a producer may let one vendor distribute its titles thus making
it important to know all the distributors and the producers they handle. A good
resource for identifying video producers is Leonard Maltin&rsquo;s Movie and Video
Guide (New York: Plume/Penguin, annual).
</p>
<p>A number of videorecording formats exist. Mika Iisakkila&rsquo;s Video Record-
ing Formats Web site (http://www.hut.fi/~iisakkil/videoformats.html) lists fif-
teen. (This site will provide more than adequate technical information about each
format, at least for library purposes.)
</p>
<p>In addition to the physical format, there is a need to understand that differ-
ent countries have different video standards. This means that a video produced in
Europe, intended for that market, will not play in a standard U.S. or Canadian
VCR. There are three major standards and four &ldquo;minor&rdquo; standards around the
world.
</p>
<p>&bull; NTSC&mdash;Canada, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and United States
</p>
<p>&bull; PAL&mdash;B/G&mdash;Germany, Spain, and Western Europe
</p>
<p>I&mdash;Hong Kong and United Kingdom
</p>
<p>/K&mdash;China
</p>
<p>&bull; SECAM&mdash;B/G&mdash;Egypt, Iran, and Saudi Arabia
</p>
<p>D/K&mdash;Eastern Europe
</p>
<p>L&mdash;France
</p>
<p>There are also PAL&mdash;M in Brazil, Pal&mdash;N in Argentina, and NTSC4.43 and
MESECAM, used in the Middle East.
</p>
<p>Although it is unlikely that any library will be acquiring large quantities of
such videos from around the world, this list does make it clear that ordering a for-
mat that will play on library-owned equipment is important. Now that an increas-
ing number of academic libraries are building video collections, there are
frequent requests for videorecordings from other countries. Unless the library
has a &ldquo;universal VCR&rdquo;&mdash;one that can play any standard&mdash;it is very important
when attempting to secure a video from another country to determine whether
the library can purchase a tape produced to play on its VCRs.
</p>
<p>Videorecordings, in the cassette format, reduce the equipment problems
that were associated with motion picture collections. More and more people own
videocassette player-recorders and therefore know something about how to op-
erate the equipment, unlike the situation with motion picture projectors.
</p>
<p>278 13&mdash;Nonbook Materials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As of 2001, some libraries were purchasing laser discs or DVDs but few
had circulating collections. Of the public libraries surveyed in 1998, 11 percent
had DVD or laser disc collections.5 In time, the DVD may replace the VHS cas-
sette in library collections. What is happening with the home video is very simi-
lar to what has taken place with sounding recordings: a constant shift from one
format to another. Essentially this forces libraries to repurchase content that is al-
ready in the collection in an older format. This is not always a bad thing, but as
the speed of technology accelerates, the costs can exceed the library&rsquo;s ability to
respond.
</p>
<p>What can a library do with videocassettes? For example, can it use a video
sold for home use in a classroom? What is meant by public performance? Public
performances are any performances the public may attend, even when there is no
fee. Library programs, including story hours and senior discussion groups, as
well as programs by any formal group, such as scouts, churches, and service or-
ganizations, are public performances. The issue of performance rights is impor-
tant for classroom use, and this is a growing area of use. According to Lillian
Gerhardt, classroom use of videos in educational institutions, elementary
through graduate school, is the steadiest-growing area of video use.6
</p>
<p>Many special libraries also are facing a growing demand for videos. Publi-
cations like Ellen Miller and Timothy Hallahan&rsquo;s dated but still valuable Media
Guide for Lawyers7 and Bowker&rsquo;s Law Books and Serials in Print8 and Legal
Video Review9 indicate a high level of interest in one profession. The same is true
of the medical field, where, among other titles, there is Media Profiles: The
Health Sciences.10 In addition, the visual arts, such as architecture, interior de-
sign, fashion design, and commercial art, make extensive use of video materials.
</p>
<p>Verifying videos is becoming easier and easier. Bowker&rsquo;s Complete Video
Directory,11 Video Source Book,12 Audio Video Market Place,13 and Film and
Video Finder14 all provide long lists of available video titles. Unfortunately, no
one source is comprehensive, so the staff must consult several sources when
placing orders.
</p>
<p>Access to theatrical films is reasonably easy because of the number of retail
video stores and their need to have bibliographic control. Documentary film ac-
cess also is fairly good, in the sense that there are a number of guides available.
However, independent filmmakers come and go with great speed; many never
appear in a guide, and others remain in the guides long after they are out of busi-
ness. Keeping current with changes in the independent filmmakers&rsquo; field could
become a full-time occupation, if serious collecting is a goal.
</p>
<p>Media Formats 279</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Slides
</p>
<p>For most people the term photographic slides brings to mind the traditional
family collection of 35 mm slides from various vacation trips and family events.
The common 35 mm slide is a part of many library collections, but it is not just a
matter of collecting the garden variety paper-mounted 2-by-2-inch (ca
5-by-5-cm.) 35 mm slide. As with all the other media formats, there are several
variations on a common theme. Large slide collections are likely to consist
of 2-by-2-inch (ca 5-by-5-cm.), 21 4-by-21 4-inch (ca 53 4&ndash;by-53 4-cm.), and
3-by-4-inch (ca 8-by-10-cm.) slides, perhaps with even a few old glass lantern
slides. In a sense, slides are simply filmstrips cut into individual frames and
mounted for projection onto a screen. The larger the size, the better the image
will project for large audiences. There are combined sound and slide packages,
primarily for the educational market.
</p>
<p>Slide mountings vary from paper to plastic to metal to glass. Each type of
mounting material results in a different thickness for the final slide, which may
create some projection and projector problems. Many of the projectors are capa-
ble of handling the various thicknesses but are better with one or two types of
mounts (paper and plastic). Common problems include jamming, with potential
damage to the slide, and the need to adjust the focus for each type of mount is
common. Thus, ordering slides with the appropriate mount becomes an issue for
acquisitions staff.
</p>
<p>While the 35 mm slide is satisfactory for most general purposes, high-definition
slides require a larger film format. Such slides are commonly found in special li-
braries, especially those supporting scientific, medical, and art museum work.
Historical picture collections may include stereo slides as well as a variety of still
photographs and negatives. Stereo slides and photographs may also be part of a
map collection. (Stereo slides or photographs are slightly overlapping images
that, with special viewers, give the illusion of three dimensions.)
</p>
<p>Only special and academic libraries collect extensively in the slide format.
Special libraries (museums, medical, technical, art and architecture) will have
working slide collections. It is rare for a public library to have a slide collection,
even in the standard 35 mm format, despite the number of homes that have slide
projectors. Some high school and most academic libraries will have instructional
collections. Anyone teaching an art appreciation course will want slides for
classroom use as well as for students to view independently. A constant problem
for the staff members who are responsible for the slide collection is keeping track
of thousands of small square and rectangular thin pieces of film and mounting
material. Another problem is loss of color when slides are exposed to light, in-
cluding the projector&rsquo;s lamp (there is more about this in the discussion of preser-
vation later in this chapter). Efforts to &ldquo;copy&rdquo; slides into a digital database, via
scanning, can result in a well-preserved collection but may violate copyright.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest problem in collecting slides is the large number of
sources, which may produce packages of highly variable quality. A major issue
with slides is color quality and the quality of lighting and exposure. Slow expo-
sure using a fine-grained film produces the best-quality slides, assuming the pho-
tography (focus, composition, and so forth) and film processing were performed
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>competently. Staff must check incoming slide orders to ensure that they are at
least in focus and have no developing chemical residue visible; selectors will
probably also wish to check the order before the library pays for the shipment to
make certain other technical requirements are met.
</p>
<p>Transparencies
</p>
<p>Transparencies and opaque projector materials are used primarily in educa-
tion. Of all the media choices available, this form is the most group-oriented, de-
signed to aid in the presentation of graphic material to small and medium-sized
groups. Although an individual can use the material, it has no advantage over flat
pictures. A library could obtain materials in this format related to adult education
classes, especially in the science fields. Because this format has limited value to
the individual user, public libraries seldom collect it. One of the long-published
guides to educational transparencies is Elementary School Library Collection,
22nd edition (Brodart, 2000; also available on CD-ROM).
</p>
<p>School media centers may collect overhead transparencies. As with the pic-
ture files, the transparency collection focuses on the teaching units of the school
district and normally supplements the teachers&rsquo; personal collections. Commer-
cial sources produce quantities of transparencies geared toward supplementing
major text series. Textbook publishers often offer their own series of transparen-
cies based on or using illustrations from their books. Generally the library must
order the transparencies separately because few publishers automatically pro-
vide &ldquo;supplementary teaching materials&rdquo; with a textbook.
</p>
<p>Flat Pictures
</p>
<p>Flat pictures, such as paintings, posters, postcards, photographs, and other
pictorial materials are often part of a library&rsquo;s collection. School libraries often
have a collection of pictures from magazines and other sources that teachers use
to supplement their personal collections. The collection focuses on the teaching
units in the particular school district. Some public libraries have a circulating
collection of art reproductions, both paintings and sculptures. Museums and aca-
demic libraries often have extensive collections of posters, usually housed in
special collections in the case of academic libraries. Photographic archives, mu-
seums, and academic libraries often have collections of photographs and occa-
sionally postcards. The archive normally focuses on historic photographs.
</p>
<p>Aside from a few UNESCO publications, there is little bibliographic con-
trol in this field. Selectors and acquisition staff must learn about producers and
maintain files of catalogs to secure these materials in a timely fashion. Once in a
great while there are reviews of these formats in LJ, Booklist, and SLJ that pro-
vide the producer&rsquo;s name, which at least provides a starting point for tracking a
purchasing source.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Maps
</p>
<p>Maps are a form of pictorial material, and most libraries have at least a
small collection, in addition to atlases in the reference collection. Small collec-
tions of local area maps pose no particular problem other than having them dis-
appear into an individual&rsquo;s books or brief case. Large public libraries, academic
libraries, and many business and industrial libraries have extensive map collec-
tions. Maps, as graphic representations of geological, physical, and natural fea-
tures, take many forms and shapes, from folded road maps to raised relief globes.
Any major map collection must determine its scope and define what to collect.
Most would include aerial photographs, including satellite photographs, but
should they also house the remote sensing data from satellites? Are raised relief
maps worth including in a collection, or are they a commercial product of no real
information value? Clearly the users&rsquo; needs will determine the answers to these
and many other questions about the collection.
</p>
<p>Globes and maps, although different in form and requiring different han-
dling, usually are available from the same sources. Most libraries have always
had a small collection of local maps and atlases, along with a globe or two. In-
creased leisure time and increased interest in outdoor recreational activities have
generated a demand for maps of recreational areas for boaters, campers, and hikers.
</p>
<p>The control of map production is very uneven. One source that helps track
down map producers is MapLink (http://www.maplink.com). This is a Web site
for the International Map Trade Association that provides information about
more than 800 map producers around the world. (Note: This is not an acquisi-
tions site but rather a location to search for maps and identify a purchasing
source.) The largest producers of maps are government agencies, and the tools
discussed in Chapter 12 may be of some use in identifying potential sources of
such materials. Although national agency maps are reasonably well controlled,
state and local agencies have little central control. Acquisitions departments
need to develop and maintain their own lists, if map collecting becomes a signifi-
cant activity.
</p>
<p>An interesting development is the growing use of computer-based
(CD-ROM and tape) geographic and demographic data. The Geographic Infor-
mation System (GIS) opens a new and challenging area of image collecting for
many libraries. (GIS is a computer-based tool for analyzing and mapping fea-
tures. It combines database operations, such as statistical analysis, with unique
visualization and geographic analysis capability to create maps.) It does, how-
ever, require equipment that is capable of handling the images and color graphics
these products contain.

<p>Sound Recordings: Discs and Tapes
</p>
<p>Returning to a widely held format, sound recordings, we again encounter
great diversity and incompatibility. Sound recordings were among the first
nonbook formats collected by libraries. In public libraries, the recordings are
usually part of the circulating collection. For educational libraries, the purpose is
usually instructional, with limited use outside the library. This is the media cate-
gory that most clearly reflects the long-term influence of changing technology
on a library collection.
</p>
<p>Sound tapes and CDs are the most popular formats of today for sound record-
ings. With increased portability of radios and tape and CD players, the popular
music industry dropped the 45 rpm recording in favor of cassette tapes and, later,
CDs and CD &ldquo;mini-discs.&rdquo; The life span of each new and better recording method
(except possibly the CD) is getting shorter and shorter, and most are not compati-
ble with other forms. An old sound recording collection could consist of cylinders,
disks (161 2, 45, 331 3, 78 rpm, and CDS), tapes (reel-to-reel with both acetate and
wire recordings recorded at a variety of speeds), and cassettes (both dual track and
8-track, and recorded on tapes with different characteristics that may or may cause
equipment problems). Each format needs its own equipment or older, more flexi-
ble equipment, either of which requires special skills to maintain.
</p>
<p>For public libraries the spoken word tapes, or &ldquo;audiobooks,&rdquo; have become
almost as important as the video collection. (Audiobook is the best term to use, as
many of the other shorthand labels people use are in fact copyrighted names&mdash;
e.g., Books on Tape, Talking Book, Recorded Book, BookCassette, and Talking
Tape.) Automobile and portable handheld tape players have created a market for
audio books. Even reading a small paperback book on a crowded subway or bus
can be difficult. Popping a tape into a small player that fits in one&rsquo;s jacket pocket
and has a small headset allows the listener to close out the noise, to some degree,
and enjoy a favorite piece of music or listen to a current best-selling book. The
same is true for those commuting in cars or just out for their &ldquo;power walk.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The audiobook format has substantial sales to individuals as well as librar-
ies. In a 1996 article in Publishers Weekly, one of the titles on tape passed the 1
million copy mark (The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R.
Covey, S&amp;S Audio).15 The same article listed twenty-nine titles that had sur-
passed the 175,000 sales mark. An interesting feature of the list was that seven-
teen of the titles were nonfiction. The fact that PW has a regular section on
audiobooks is an indication of their importance to the trade.
</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of sound cassettes, spoken word or music, is that they
have a relatively short life span, five to six years, even under favorable usage
conditions. They are also small objects that have few places upon which a library
can attach a security strip or device, so their loss rate (shrinkage in retail terms)
can be rather high. Replacing lost items can be costly.
</p>
<p>Media Formats 283</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Some of the same issues about tape length and so forth apply to music re-
cordings as well. As noted previously, libraries have had music recording collec-
tions for a great many years. Some have also collected music scores; a question
for the library is, should the scores and recordings be housed together? In the
case of academic institutions the music department, if it does have a separate li-
brary, would like the two together. The reality for most libraries is that, if they do
combine the two, scores probably will have to move to the media department,
first, because that is where the equipment is that can play back the recordings and
where the staff has the training to assist the public in the use of the equipment,
and second, because few libraries have the resources to buy additional playback
equipment and find space for it where the scores are located (usually in the main
book collection stacks). Finally, the storage needs of the formats are very differ-
ent. In the 1997 edition of A Basic Music Library, the editors made the following
statement:
</p>
<p>[D]ifferences reflect inherent, practical distinctions between
print and recordings: printed music is typically sought by play-
ers or students of a particular instrument (bassoon) or medium
(choral), while recordings tend to be thought of in relation to a
stylistic category (salsa) with less concern towards details of
instrumentation.16
</p>
<p>This view may or may not help those libraries attempting to provide both record-
ings and scores for their service population, at least in terms of deciding on inte-
grating the two formats.
</p>
<p>The commercial music and spoken-book trade is reasonably well con-
trolled in a bibliographic sense; certainly there is more control than for any other
nonbook format.
</p>
<p>Other Media
</p>
<p>Printed Music
</p>
<p>One rather surprising void in public and academic libraries is sheet music.
When both recorded music and books about music are available, why is it so dif-
ficult to secure the scores? Cost is one explanation, but most other media cost
more than books. Difficulty in handling (storage and checking in the parts) may
be another aspect of the problem, but other media are also difficult to handle in
some ways. Libraries ought to reconsider this format; music publishers&rsquo; catalogs
are available, and there is frequently a community need.
</p>
<p>284 13&mdash;Nonbook Materials</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Most academic music departments would like the library to collect
full-sized scores (also called complete, open, or performance scores) and minia-
ture scores (pocket or study scores). Music accreditation groups expect to find
scores on campus, and because of the problems in maintaining them and control-
ling their use, the library is the location of choice. One of the biggest factors lim-
iting the growth of score collections, other than cost, is that scores are unbound
and need special handling. Because they are and must remain unbound, pages
easily get lost and damaged, usually requiring the purchase of another full score.
Information about scores appears in the Music Library Association&rsquo;s A Basic
Music Library guide,17 and there are reviews in Notes, Music Review, Music and
Letters, and other journals.
</p>
<p>Models
</p>
<p>Models have had a long history of use in education, especially in the sci-
ences. Libraries have not been active collectors, in part because instructors fre-
quently want to keep the models in the laboratories and classrooms for regular
use. Students need access to these items for study at times when the labs and
classrooms are unavailable. Perhaps computer-generated virtual reality models
providing a satisfactory three-dimensional alternative, such as A.D.A.M., will be
more widely used in the future. For the present, libraries should consider physi-
cal models.
</p>
<p>One factor limiting the acquisition of models is their cost. Good models are
expensive, and small institutions may be able to afford only one model for class-
room use. Storage of models is another limiting factor because most are bulky
and vary in size, making it difficult to store them on standard library shelving.
</p>
<p>Reviews of these materials are few and far between. Booklist occasionally
reviews models. Three curriculum journals, Curator, Instructor, and Curricu-
lum Review, also publish model reviews. Libraries usually purchase models
from educational supply houses.
</p>
<p>(�� �����%
</p>
<p>To some degree, the cost of the material under consideration, rather than the
usual collection development factors, drives the question of whether the pur-
chase decision is an individual or group process. Making a mistake about a
twenty-minute sound, color, educational video has more serious economic con-
sequences for the library budget than most single mistakes about a book, trans-
parency, or sound recording. Educational videos are very expensive, especially
for multiple cassette packages. Having multiple opinions about a prospective
purchase helps prevent costly mistakes. In public libraries and school media cen-
ters, a nonbook selection committee is the typical mechanism employed for se-
curing multiple points of view. In academic libraries, often a single faculty
member makes the recommendation, assuming the purchase will use departmen-
tal funds, or the head of the library&rsquo;s media program selects titles on the basis of
reviews and a knowledge of instructional needs.
</p>
<p>Previewing 285</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Previewing as a group means the acquisitions staff must know the date or
date range that will meet the scheduling needs of those doing the previewing.
(This may be a rather lengthy process if the supplier cannot ship the item(s) at the
desired time; that usually results in several interactions, with the acquisitions
staff serving as the go-between to find an acceptable date.) The typical approach
is for the acquisitions department to request the preview items. The staff must be
careful to keep the preview material from becoming intermingled with pur-
chased materials and retain the shipping material for returning the previewed
items.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind several other factors for previewing as well. A preview copy
may have had some prior use; therefore, the quality may not be as high as that of
a new copy. If the library can determine from the supplier how often the item
went out for previewing, it is possible to gain insight into the durability of the
product. In assessing this information (assuming one can get it), the librarian
must remember that the preview copy&rsquo;s use was by individuals who know how to
properly handle the material (unlike many library users).
</p>
<p>��,"���
�&amp;���
&amp;&amp;��
</p>
<p>At this time, there is no comprehensive source for nonbook materials simi-
lar to Books in Print. This makes identifying potentially useful nonbook materi-
als something of a challenge. The National Information Center for Educational
Media (NICEM) focuses on educational materials; however, because NICEM
employs a rather broad definition of education, the publications are useful to all
types of libraries and its resources come the closest to being a media BIP for the
United States. NICEM Net (http://www.nicem.com) allows searching the entire
database by subject, age level, and media type. The 2001 subscription was $895
for a single user license for a year. (Online access to the database is available
through Silver Platter and EBSCOHost. There are CD-ROM, tape load, and print
versions available.) The database contains almost 465,000 records in English
and sixty other languages. Its primary strengths lie in the video, sound recording,
and CD-ROM formats, although there are records for almost every format dis-
cussed in this chapter. The database also has a 300-page thesaurus of terms used
to index it, which is a great help in formulating accurate searches.
</p>
<p>Some of the most active nonbook discussion lists are MEDIA-L@BINGVMB
.CC.BINGHAMTON.EDU, from the ALA Video Round Table videolib@library
.berkeley.edu, and VIDEONEWS@library.berkeley.edu. These provide infor-
mation on how to handle various media issues as well as information about
sources.
</p>
<p>Canadian sources for nonbook materials are mentioned on page 288.
Additional guides are listed in the Suggested Reading section at the end of

<p>&amp;�'����%�+�'��
</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, the process of ordering materials in the formats
discussed in this chapter is the same for ordering books and serials, with a few
exceptions. One difference is that libraries place most of these orders directly
with the producer, because there are no general audiovisual jobbers as there are
for books and serials. Some book jobbers, such as Baker &amp; Taylor and National
Book Service, handle some of the most widely collected formats, for example,
videos and sound tapes, but they do not handle the full range of nonbook materi-
als. Another difference is the need to obtain preview copies.
</p>
<p>There is a major difference between review copies of books and preview
copies of other media. With books, if the purchaser likes what he or she sees, the
library keeps it, pays the invoice, and perhaps orders multiple copies at the same
time. With nonbook materials, for a number of reasons (risk of loss, damage, and
so forth), the library requests preview copies from the supplier, views the copy,
and then generally returns the item. (Some producers now send a new copy&mdash;es-
pecially for videos&mdash;and expect the library to keep the copy if it decides to buy
the item. These producers generally impose a previewing fee, but deduct the
charge from the purchase price. The library must request the preview copy well
in advance of the preview date. Normally, a librarian writes to the producer or
supplier, asking for preview copies of certain titles and listing a number of alter-
native dates. This becomes an issue when previewing with a group, which may
cause scheduling problems. The librarian also must know when specific items
will be available for previewing. A preview file thus becomes a very important
aid in the selection process; it contains a listing of each title requested, the dates
requested, scheduled preview dates, and the result of the preview.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving the purchased copy, a staff member should view the item to
be certain it is (1) a new print, (2) the item the library ordered, and (3) technically
sound (checking for breaks, sound quality, and quality of processing). Checking
for technical soundness upon receipt should be standard procedure for all
nonbook items, not just for previewed items. Generally, other media are not
mass produced in the same manner as are books. Many are produced on demand,
that is, in response to orders. The producer has several preview copies and a mas-
ter copy; when an order arrives, the producer uses the master copy to produce a
new print.
</p>
<p>One issue to decide before ordering is that of performance rights. Does the
library pay an additional fee for public performance rights, or are they part of the
quoted price? (This is a typical issue for videos.) There may be some justification
for paying a somewhat higher price for performance rights in an educational set-
ting, but not when the videos are for circulating home use. The classic example
of the confusion between &ldquo;the home market&rdquo; and &ldquo;the library market&rdquo; was Public
Broadcasting System&rsquo;s release of its series The Civil War in 1990. Initially it was
available to libraries for $450; in only a few months PBS released it to the &ldquo;home
</p>
<p>Ordering Media 287</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>market&rdquo; for just under $200. Another example, from 1995, was Malcolm X:
Make It Plain&mdash;$99.95 from PBS Video (with public performance rights) and
$29.95 from MPI Home Video (with home video rights).18 Failing to obtain pub-
lic performance rights and using a video in a &ldquo;public performance&rdquo; setting could
lead to a very costly lawsuit. Knowing how the item is most likely to be used, ac-
quiring the appropriate rights, and maintaining a record of what was purchased
can be important in building media collections.
</p>
<p>Not many jobbers handle a wide variety of media formats; most handle only
one or two. Baker &amp; Taylor handles a wide range of sound, video, and more re-
cently DVD titles. The firm also offers a standing order service for the sound and
VHS formats as well as cataloging and processing. National Book Service in
Canada provides videos, CD-ROMs, puppets, posters, and banners, as well as
books, library supplies, and cataloging and processing.
</p>
<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>Acquiring media is a labor intensive and time-consuming undertaking, but
it is important and worthwhile for both the library and its service population.
Each new format is capable of doing certain things that no other format can do,
but each also has its limitations, and as a result, they supplement rather than re-
place each other. It is clear that there are various preferences among those seek-
ing and enjoying information. If the library is to be responsive to the community,
it must build a collection of materials that reflects that community&rsquo;s various in-
terests and tastes. That in turn will mean technical services will have to be equal
to the challenge.

<p>As is true for most individuals, libraries never seem to have enough money
to do everything they would like accomplish. Ultimately, the sole purpose of a li-
brary is to provide information to the end-user and its collections are the key ele-
ment in that service. Acquisitions departments play an essential role in the
effective use of the funds that are available. Library fiscal management is a joint
activity involving everyone who participates in the process: selectors, acquisi-
tions staff, and senior management. Controlling expenditures and securing ade-
quate funding are two key activities. Monies spent on materials for the collection
constitute the second largest expense category for the majority of libraries and
information centers. Traditionally, in U.S. and Canadian libraries, salaries repre-
sent the largest percentage of the total budget, followed by the materials
(&ldquo;book&rdquo;) budget, and finally, all other operating expenses. That order applies to-
day, but the percentage spent on materials has decreased as salaries have risen
and the overall budget has increased slowly, if at all. Although percentages vary,
the order also remains the same in any type of information environment or any
size collection. Most of the literature on the topic of collection budgeting reflects
a large research library orientation. However, the same issues exist in other li-
braries. Similarly, most of the ideas and suggestions contained in such articles
apply equally well to other information settings.
</p>
<p>In the recent past there has been a constant pressure on the materials budget
of most libraries. This pressure has resulted in a decline in the percentage of the
total budget spent on acquiring items for the collection. The almost yearly dou-
ble-digit inflation of serials prices has further skewed the traditional balance in
collection fund allocations. In many libraries in the United States, serials expen-
ditures exceed monographic purchases, even in institutions that have tradition-
ally emphasized book collections.

<p>Comparing the total amount of money expended on materials thirty years
ago with the current funding levels, today&rsquo;s total is considerably higher. Unfor-
tunately, the total expenditures do not tell the entire story. Looking at the number
of items acquired for the money reveals that the increase in acquisitions is not
proportional to the funding increases. Libraries are spending more and acquiring
less. Since the 1970s, many libraries, along with many other organizations, have
dealt with budgets that some call &ldquo;steady state,&rdquo; others call &ldquo;zero growth,&rdquo; and
still others call &ldquo;static.&rdquo; At best, budgeting of this type uses the previous year&rsquo;s
inflation rate as the base for the next fiscal year&rsquo;s increase. An average inflation
rate, like all averages, contains elements that increase at both above and below
the average rate. For libraries this is a problem, because the inflation rate for in-
formation materials has been running well ahead of the overall inflation rate.
</p>
<p>(�&amp;#��+�����*������+���%�+��

</p>
<p>Over the years, collection development staffs in the United States and Can-
ada have faced several problems. Book and journal prices have generally in-
creased, and continue to increase, at rates well above the U.S. average inflation
rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). As a result, most libraries
have experienced some decline in acquisition rates. Serials prices increased even
more rapidly than did monographic prices. To maintain serial subscriptions, li-
braries took monies from book funds, thus further reducing the number of mono-
graphs acquired. Eventually, libraries started canceling subscriptions. Thus,
differential inflation rates and the use of national average rates as the basis for
calculating budgets have contributed to declining acquisition rates for many
libraries.
</p>
<p>A second problem was, and still is, that the materials budget is vulnerable in
periods of tight budgets. Expenditures on materials are somewhat discretionary
in that (in theory) a library could wait to buy an item until the next fiscal year. In-
stitutions set staff salaries on an annual basis, and staff reductions are rare during
the middle of a fiscal year, unless the organization faces a major financial crisis.
Salaries are the last item organizations cut when attempting to save money.
Without heat, light, and water (utility bills), the organization cannot remain
open, so those expenditures generally are not cut during a fiscal year. There are
some operating expenses that are discretionary: pens, pencils, paper, printer car-
tridges, and so forth (i.e., office supplies). Professional development and travel
reimbursements may be frozen in an attempt to save funds. Institutions may
achieve small savings, in terms of percentage of the total budget, by cutting back
in such areas. Institutions with relatively large library collections view the mate-
rials budget as one of the largest available pools of funds that could be cut in an
emergency. (Even a medium-sized library, such as the Von der Ahe Library at
Loyola Marymount University, has a materials budget of well over U.S. $2.3
million. This amount is large enough to make the financial officers look at it as a
source of significant funds if needed.) Further, the reality is that the monograph
materials budget is the only place where significant cuts are easy to make be-
cause the material is not purchased on an ongoing basis. All too often, the
long-term impact of such decisions does not receive enough consideration, and
</p>
<p>294 14&mdash;Fiscal Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the other choices appear, at least in the short run, to be even less acceptable.
These issues are institutional and apply to corporate and special libraries as much
as to publicly funded libraries.
</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s libraries shifted collecting emphasis from
monographs to maintaining periodicals collections. Today, that shift is slowly
reversing, and through careful library budget preparation and presentation, fund-
ing authorities appear to be more willing to accept differential budget increases
that more closely reflect the actual expense experience. If nothing else, the prob-
lems of the past thirty years have caused collection development officers to be-
come better planners and to develop more accurate methods for calculating
budgetary needs. As a result, they have more credibility with funding authorities.
</p>

</p>
<p>The vast majority of libraries and information centers are part of
not-for-profit (NFP) organizations. Being not-for-profit affects how the library
maintains its financial records, particularly when contrasted with for-profit orga-
nizations. For libraries that are part of a government jurisdiction, most revenues
are received through an annual budget. The funding authorities review the bud-
get requests and authorize certain levels of funding for various activities. The
three most common forms of income for libraries are appropriations (monies dis-
tributed by the governing body to its agencies to carry out specific purposes),
revenue generated by the library as a result of service fees and fines, and endow-
ments and donations.
</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the financial activities, certain accounting terms
and concepts are different for NFP organizations than for for-profit organiza-
tions. However, some general accounting rules and practices do apply. One spe-
cial term for NFP accounting is fund accounting. (Fund accounting has been
defined as a set of self-balancing account groups.) Another difference is that
whereas the profit-oriented bookkeeping system equation uses assets, liabilities,
and equity, NFP accounting uses assets, liabilities, and fund balance. One of the
equations for NFP bookkeeping is that assets must equal liabilities plus the fund
balance; another is that the fund balance is the difference between assets and lia-
bilities. Substituting &ldquo;equity&rdquo; for &ldquo;fund balance&rdquo; would make the equation apply
to for-profit organizations. (A difference between these equations is that an in-
crease in fund balance carries with it no special meaning, whereas an increase in
equity is a positive signal in a for-profit organization.) Other terms, such as debit,
credit, journalizing, posting, and trial balance, have the same meaning regard-
less of the organization&rsquo;s profit orientation. Balance sheets are discussed in
greater detail later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>Accounting is &ldquo;the process of identifying, measuring, and communicating
economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by users of
the information.&rdquo;1 Several groups or individuals in the library use accounting in-
formation (the term accounting includes bookkeeping activities). Selectors need
to know how much money they have to spend. The head librarian needs data to
maintain control over the library&rsquo;s operation. The business office must have the
information to ensure that the library handles its funds properly. It is the acquisitions
</p>
<p>Library Fund Accounting 295</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>department that provides this information, at least about that portion of the li-
brary&rsquo;s budget used for building the collections. Usually there is a support staff
member who handles the accounting activities. This person needs to have train-
ing and experience in accounting and bookkeeping. Anyone interested in a
career as a support staff member in acquisitions might consider taking
coursework in accounting, because such work expands employment opportuni-
ties (in seeking both a position and promotions).
</p>
<p>The bookkeeping unit usually handles all of a library&rsquo;s accounting work
(payroll records, accounts payable/receivable, purchasing, inventory control,
and some cost accounting). Frequently, this unit is part of the acquisitions depart-
ment. When this is not the case, the unit must work very closely with the acquisi-
tions department because a large percentage of the work involves both units.
Consequently, everyone in acquisitions must have some basic understanding of
accounting and bookkeeping, even those not directly involved in those activities.
</p>
<p>Although library bookkeeping requires some variations from the standard
practice, it is important for the library staff handling the internal books to under-
stand standard accounting procedures. The library bookkeeper, for example,
must reconcile library records with those of the business office. Because the re-
sults concern many people, it is important to understand the business office&rsquo;s re-
cords and what they represent.
</p>
<p>���&amp;"�

</p>
<p>The term accounting covers several activities that many people view as
separate fields:
</p>
<p>1. General accounting deals with the process of recording fiscal data
(includes bookkeeping).
</p>
<p>2. Cost accounting determines business costs (most frequently, unit
costs).
</p>
<p>3. Tax accounting determines liability for taxes, especially income and
Social Security taxes.
</p>
<p>4. Auditing is the process of verifying the accuracy of financial records.
</p>
<p>5. Budgetary accounting is the preparation of systematic forecasts of
operations in fiscal terms.
</p>
<p>6. System building is the development and installation of the appropriate
financial records in an organization.
</p>
<p>7. Governmental accounting deals with maintaining financial records
for governmental units.
</p>
<p>Library accounting takes in the first four fields and the last; the fifth and sixth
fields seldom apply to library situations.
</p>
<p>The difference between accounting and bookkeeping is that accounting empha-
sizes theory and bookkeeping emphasizes technique. Accounting is comprehensive
</p>
<p>296 14&mdash;Fiscal Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in scope, whereas bookkeeping focuses on the methods by which the bookkeeper
records fiscal transactions.
</p>
<p>The Balance Sheet
</p>
<p>One important element in accounting and bookkeeping is the balance sheet,
which indicates the institution&rsquo;s financial condition at any given time. Although
the library may not always have a balance sheet, its parent/funding body will
have one, and the library&rsquo;s expenditures must fit into that larger fiscal picture.
Thus, having some basic knowledge of the balance sheet assists the staff in
understanding some of the requirements of the funding authorities. The funding
authorities are also usually accountable to other agencies that frequently require
audits of the &ldquo;books.&rdquo; (There is more about audits later in this chapter.)
</p>
<p>A balance sheet shows the amounts and nature of assets, liabilities, and pro-
prietorship of an organization. As noted previously, the balance sheet is the state-
ment of the basic equation of accounting: assets = liabilities + proprietorship.
Assets are anything of value owned; liabilities are obligations to pay (money or
other assets) or to render service to persons or organizations now or in the future;
proprietorship is the difference between assets and liabilities. A library has pro-
prietorship only when it derives a portion of its funds from endowments.
(Normally there is an annual distribution of endowment income. Otherwise, the
term &ldquo;fund balance&rdquo; may be substituted for &ldquo;proprietorship.&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>No uniform format exists for the balance sheet. However, two very com-
mon methods of presenting a statement of financial condition are the account
form (horizontal form) and the report form (vertical form). Account forms list
assets on the left-hand side of a page and liabilities and proprietorship on the
right-hand side. The final totals of the columns are equal. The report form lists all
assets, then all liabilities, and finally the proprietorship. A great many variations
exist on these basic forms, but the important point to remember is that the assets
must equal the liabilities and proprietorship.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the format employed on a balance sheet, assets can never be
greater than the total of liabilities and proprietorship (fund balance). If the assets
are greater, a mistake exists in the recording or the assignment of the data. Liabil-
ities and proprietorship can be greater than the assets, but this is an indication
that the organization or individual is or may soon be in financial difficulty.
</p>
<p>Accounts and Ledgers
</p>
<p>Every business transaction has dual elements (a part of the &ldquo;dual entry&rdquo; sys-
tem described later). Every financial entry in the journals and ledgers in the ac-
quisitions department is a business transaction of some type. The dual elements
arise because each transaction is an exchange of values: Something of value is
given up for something else, presumably of equal value. The bookkeeper must
record both elements. As these factors change, they change the value of the assets,
liabilities, and proprietorship. Thus, it is important to have a recording system
</p>
<p>Accounting 297</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>that will show the changes with a minimum of space, effort, and error. A poor
system can create a tremendous amount of extra work.
</p>
<p>Most automated systems provide a short, accurate method for recording
transactions, separating the increases from the decreases for each amount. This
means balancing assets against liabilities and proprietorship. An account records
the effects of a transaction. An acquisitions department uses as many accounts as
necessary to provide adequate detailed information. Usually, there is one ac-
count for each fund in the department, and once a month the bookkeeper assem-
bles the data in these accounts into a balance sheet. The conventional method of
handling accounts places additions to assets on the left side of the account and
additions to liabilities and proprietorship on the right.
</p>
<p>Two terms used in recording changes in value are debit (Dr.) and credit
(Cr.). Debit refers to the left side of an account (assets). Credit refers to the right
side (liabilities). Thus, a debit is an entry on the left, and a credit an entry on the
right. The idea of debits tied to assets and credits to liabilities can be very confus-
ing to beginners and to anyone not acquainted with accounting terminology. Per-
haps the best way to keep the relationships in mind and to remember how the
terms affect the balance is to use a chart like the following:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Debit&rdquo; indicates that &ldquo;Credit&rdquo; indicates that
</p>
<p>Assets increase Assets decrease
</p>
<p>Liabilities decrease Liabilities increase
</p>
<p>Proprietorship decreases Proprietorship increases
</p>
<p>Income decreases Income increases
</p>
<p>Expenses increase Expenses decrease
</p>
<p>A basic rule of accounting is that for every debit there must be a credit. This does
not mean that the number of debit and credit entries must be equal, but rather that
the debit and credit amounts must be equal.
</p>
<p>The name for a group of accounts is the ledger. This is a derived record pre-
senting in an analytical form the total effect of all transactions. Data are taken
from the books in which the bookkeeper made the original entries (called jour-
nals, discussed shortly). Normally, there is only one account on a &ldquo;page&rdquo; of the
ledger. In the past, a loose-leaf ledger was very common because it was flexible.
Today&rsquo;s automated systems have made the paper-based ledger a thing of the
past, although some acquisitions departments maintain a paper-based &ldquo;shadow
system&rdquo; in case the computer system goes down. Accounts can be arranged and
rearranged in whatever order works for the department.
</p>
<p>Once a month the bookkeeper prepares a trial balance. This is a listing of
ledger accounts showing debit and credit balances. The object is to determine
whether the debits and credits are equal, or in &ldquo;balance.&rdquo; A trial balance serves
several purposes:
</p>
<p>1. It provides a partial check on the accuracy of bookkeeping by proving
the equality of total debits and credits.
</p>
<p>298 14&mdash;Fiscal Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. It provides a way to more quickly detect errors and their sources.
</p>
<p>3. It provides a condensed picture of each account as well as a summary
of all accounts.
</p>
<p>4. It is often the basis for preparing financial statements.
</p>
<p>Trial balancing uses three columns. One column is for the account total, and
the other two are for the account debits and credits. Bookkeepers use two tech-
niques to show the amounts for each account on the trial balance. One technique
is to list only the balance of each account; this approach reduces the initial
amount of work. The other method is to list the amounts in the debit and credit
columns for each account, which provides more detailed information.
</p>
<p>The trial balance is an essential accounting tool, but it does not reveal some
kinds of errors. It indicates whether debits and credits are equal, but not whether
compensating errors have occurred on both sides of the account. An item may be
properly posted&mdash;that is, the right amounts on the debit and credit sides&mdash;but to
the wrong account. A trial balance does not reveal a mistake in classifying infor-
mation in the journal. Of course, an unrecorded ledger transaction will also go
undetected during a trial balance. Therefore, even if the trial balance appears to
be correct, there may be a number of errors in the system. This is one of the rea-
sons that it is necessary to have the books audited.
</p>
<p>The Journal
</p>
<p>As indicated, the ledger is not a complete record of transactions. For a num-
ber of reasons, it is desirable to have a preliminary record in which one records
transactions in chronological order with an explanation of the nature of each en-
try. In an acquisitions department, sequential order numbers constitute, in part,
such a primary record. The order file used to be a part of what accountants called
the daybook, an informal record of the day&rsquo;s activity. Today, most organizations
do not use a daybook but make entries directly into the electronic journal. The
journal is the book of original entry, with transactions recorded in chronological
order. Entries to the journal come from whatever records now substitute for the
daybook (e.g., invoices, orders, sales slips, cash register tapes). A journal may be
more than just a book with account numbers, debits, credits, and a brief explana-
tion about the transaction. Often associated with it are files of documents,
punched cards, tapes, or other media (backup material explaining the transac-
tion). Following are the important features of the journal:
</p>
<p>1. It is a day-to-day record of each transaction.
</p>
<p>2. It is the point at which the debit and credit aspects of all transactions
can be analyzed. This very important activity can cause a great many
problems if done improperly.
</p>
<p>3. It is the point at which a transaction becomes a series of numbers. The
explanation of the transaction may not be extensive. However, it must
</p>
<p>Accounting 299</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>be adequate to direct someone from the journal entry to the proper
backup file to find a full explanation.
</p>
<p>The term used to indicate recording entries in a journal is journalizing. Many li-
braries now employ one of several computer-based spreadsheet programs to
handle this task.
</p>
<p>Journals and ledgers are the basic items in what accountants call the double-
entry accounting system. Double-entry simply means recording each transaction
both in the journal and in the ledger. The journal is the original chronological re-
cord; the ledger is a secondary analytical record. Perhaps the most important dif-
ference between the journal and the ledger is that because the journal contains
the first entries, it usually carries greater weight as legal evidence.
</p>
<p>In most libraries, the major fund is the operating fund. Other funds may be
endowment and physical plant funds. The operating funds are the group of ac-
counts used to handle the day-to-day activities of the library for a given time,
usually twelve months, covering such items as salaries, materials purchases, and
utility bills. Within the operating fund there may be two categories of accounts:
restricted and unrestricted.
</p>
<p>Restricted accounts require using the monies only for specific purposes.
Collection development and acquisition staffs often work with such accounts
(frequently referred to as funds in the monetary rather than the accounting mean-
ing of the term). More often than not, these accounts are the result of donations
by individuals who have expressed definite ideas about how the library may
spend the money.
</p>
<p>Some libraries have endowments that are a combination of individual and
corporate or foundation gifts; an example is endowments developed under the
National Endowment for the Humanities&rsquo; Challenge Grant program. Sometimes
gifts are for current use, and sometimes they are for an endowment. Endowments
should generate income for the library indefinitely. The normal procedure for en-
dowments is to make available some percentage of the interest earned. The bal-
ance of the interest is returned to the endowment to increase its capital base.
Private libraries, and an increasing number of publicly funded libraries, have one
or more endowments. Often, the donor&rsquo;s restrictions are narrow. When the re-
strictions are too narrow, it is difficult to make effective use of the available
monies. Most collection development officers prefer unrestricted accounts (used
for any appropriate item for the collection) or broad-based restricted accounts.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the accounting system is to ensure the proper use of monies
provided and to make it possible to track expenditures. That is, one must record
(charge) every financial transaction to some account, and a record exists of what
the transaction involved. With a properly functioning fund accounting system, it
is possible to tie every item acquired to a specific account and to verify when the
transaction took place. With a good accounting system, one can easily provide
accurate reports about all financial aspects of collection development activities.
Furthermore, it is a great planning aid. It takes time to understand accounting
systems, but librarians must understand them if they wish to be effective and ef-
ficient collection development officers.

</p>
<p>Several factors influence the funding needs for collection development and
thus the amount of money the acquisitions department must handle. Changes in
the composition of the service community may have an important impact in ei-
ther a positive or negative manner. Another factor is changes in collecting activi-
ties, such as the scope or depth desired in a subject area. These factors do not
arise very often. The two cost factors that do come up year in and year out are the
price of materials and inflation.
</p>
<p>From time to time, libraries encounter problems establishing the credibility
of collection building funding requirements. Although a good accounting system
will assist in justifying budget requests, additional data about material expendi-
tures is often necessary. One example of the problems caused by inflation, stable
budgets, and rapidly rising prices for materials (and perhaps limited credibility)
is what has happened to the expenditures and acquisition rates for U.S. academic
libraries. Between 1993 and 1998, monograph prices rose just over 25 percent.
For serials, the data were almost shocking: between 1986 and 1996 prices rose
169 percent. Although the total amount of money expended was higher in 1998
than in 1993, the number of monographs purchased fell by 14 percent.5 Libraries
of every type and size experienced similar problems during this time. Library
Journal periodically publishes surveys of spending and other activities of vari-
ous types of libraries. Although the surveys are issued irregularly, when they be-
come available they provide useful national data to determine where one&rsquo;s
library falls.
</p>
<p>Data about price increases have been available for some time. During the
1970s, U.S. librarians made an all-out effort to create useful library price indexes
that measure rates of change. A subcommittee of the American National Stan-
dards Institute, the Z39 Committee, was able to develop guidelines for price in-
dexes.6 By the early 1980s, it was necessary to revise the guidelines. Another
group effort was that of the Library Materials Price Index Committee (Associa-
tion for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services of ALA). The committee has
produced a price index for U.S. materials and some international publications.
These efforts provide consistent data on price changes over a long period, which,
when averaged, is as close as anyone can come to predicting future price
changes.
</p>
<p>The most recent U.S. data are in journals; historical data appear in The
Bowker Annual. Using The Bowker Annual may be adequate for some purposes,
but the librarian needs to be aware that the information that appears in the &ldquo;cur-
rent&rdquo; volume is almost two years old. Preliminary data for books published dur-
ing a calendar year appear in Publishers Weekly (often in late February or early
March). Final data appear some months later (September or October). The major
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>problem with the published indexes is that when preparing a budget request,
up-to-date information may not be readily available. Vendors can sometimes
provide more current data. Some vendors will provide custom pricing informa-
tion, and others may provide a general set of data based on their experience, such
as the Yankee Book Peddler material illustrated in Figures 14.1, page 303, and
14.2, page 304. These information sheets contain price data about books handled
in the firm.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to obtain information about serials subscriptions from a
vendor. Figure 14.3, page 305, reproduced from EBSCO&rsquo;s Serial Price Projec-
tions&mdash; 2001, and Figures 14.4, page 306, 14.5, page 307, and 14.6, page 308, re-
produced from EBSCO&rsquo;s Serials Price Projections&mdash;1999, illustrate the
differences among types of libraries as well as the relationship between subscrip-
tion prices and exchange rates.
</p>
<p>Just as libraries prepare budget requests at different times of the year, pric-
ing data appear at various times during the year in a variety of sources. The chal-
lenge is to find the most current data, which may determine whether the library
receives requested funding.
</p>
<p>Libraries that purchase a significant number of foreign publications need to
estimate the impact of exchange rates. Volatile exchange rates affect buying
power almost as much as inflation. For example, in January 1985, the pound ster-
ling was at $1.2963 (U.S.); in January 1988 it was up to $1.7813 (U.S.); in 1992
it was $1.7653 (U.S.); by January 1994 it was down to $1.4872 (U.S.), and in
March 1999 had moved up to $1.6064 (U.S.). During the same period, the Cana-
dian dollar went from $0.6345 to $0.7693 (U.S.), then to $0.7913 (U.S.), down to
$0.736 (U.S.), and then to $0.5199 (U.S.). Although it is impossible to accurately
forecast the direction and amount of fluctuation in the exchange rates for the next
twelve months, some effort should go into studying the previous twelve months
and attempting to predict future trends. (One source for historic data is the Fed-
eral Reserve Board, at http://www.federalreserve.gov/release/G/A.) The librar-
ian must have good data about the amounts spent in various countries during the
previous year. The country of publication may be less important than the country
in which the vendor is located. For example, if the library uses the vendor
Harrassowitz, prices will be in deutsche marks, regardless of the country of ori-
gin of the items purchased. After collecting the data, the budgeter can use them
as factors in estimating the cost of continuing the current acquisition levels from
the countries from which the library normally buys.

<p>As mentioned previously, collection development funds may be restricted
or unrestricted. For most libraries, the unrestricted allocation represents the
majority of monies available for collection development. Libraries employ inter-
nal allocation systems in an attempt to match monies available with needs and to
ensure that all collecting areas have some funding for the year. These systems
provide guidelines for selection personnel; the allocation sets limits on, and
expectations for, purchases in subject areas or for certain types of material.
</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the method selected reflects the library&rsquo;s collection develop-
ment policy statement priorities. If the library employs a collecting intensity
ranking system in the collection development policy, it is reasonable to expect to
find those levels reflected in the amount of money allocated to the subject or for-
mat. Almost all allocation methods are complex, and matching the needs and
monies available requires that the library consider several factors.
</p>
<p>Among those factors are past practices, differential publication, unit cost
and inflation rates, level of demand, and actual usage. Implementing a formal al-
location system takes time and effort. Some professionals question whether it is
worthwhile allocating the monies. Opponents to allocation claim it is difficult to
develop a fair allocation model, and it is time-consuming to calculate the
amounts needed. Certainly allocations add to the workload in the acquisitions
department. Those opposed to the process also claim that, because the models
are difficult to develop, libraries tend to leave the allocations in place too long
and simply add in the next year&rsquo;s percentage increase rather than recalculating
the figures annually. They suggest that selectors may not spend accounts effec-
tively because there is too much or too little money available. Finally, they argue
that it is difficult to effect transfers from one account to another during the year.
Proponents claim that allocations provide better control of collection develop-
ment and are a more effective way to monitor expenditures.
</p>
<p>A good allocation process provides at least four outcomes. Its overall pur-
pose is to match available funds with needs. Second, it provides selectors with
guidelines for how they should allocate their time. That is, if someone is respon-
sible for three selection areas with funding allocations of U.S. $15,000, $5,000,
and $500, it is clear which area requires the most attention. (In some cases, it is
more difficult to spend the smaller amount, because one must be careful to spend
it wisely.) Third, the allocation process provides a means of assessing the selec-
tor&rsquo;s work at the end of the fiscal year. Finally, it provides clients with a sense of
collecting priorities, assuming the allocation information is made available to
them. The library can communicate the information in terms of percentages
rather than specific monetary amounts if there is a concern about divulging bud-
getary data.
</p>
<p>The allocation process should be collaborative, with input from all inter-
ested parties. Two things are certain, regardless of whether the library uses a for-
mal or informal approach to gaining input: the process has political overtones,
and the outcome will invariably disappoint an individual or group. This is partic-
ularly true when introducing a revised allocation when the budget is static. Those
who receive more money will be happy, but those who lose funds will object to
</p>
<p>Allocation of Monies 309</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the method used to reallocate the funds. Unfortunately, sometimes the objectors
are influential enough to get the allocations changed, which defeats the purpose
of the process&mdash;matching funds to needs.
</p>
<p>Which allocation method the library selects is influenced, in part, by internal
library practices, institutional needs, and extra-institutional requirements (such as
those of accreditation agencies). Internal factors include operational practices that
determine what type of information is readily available to those making the alloca-
tion decisions (e.g., vendor&rsquo;s country of origin, number of approval titles versus
firm orders, format and subject data, and use). How the library organizes its services&mdash;
centralized or decentralized&mdash;also plays a role. Other internal factors affecting
which allocation method is used include past practices for allocation and the pur-
pose of allocation (that is, its use as a control mechanism or guideline). Institu-
tional factors, in addition to the obvious importance of the institution&rsquo;s mission
and goals, include the type of budget control it employs, its organization, and its
overall financial condition. Extra-institutional factors are the political atmosphere
(for example, the degree of accountability), economic conditions, social expecta-
tions and values regarding information services (such as equal access and literacy
levels), and outside agencies (such as accreditation bodies or governmental bod-
ies) that monitor or control the institution.
</p>
<p>Allocation methods can be regarded as a continuum, with &ldquo;impulse&rdquo; at one
end of the scale and &ldquo;formula&rdquo; at the opposite end. Between the two extremes are
several more-or-less structured methods. Impulse allocation can take the form of
allowing active selectors to have greatest access to available funds or, a slightly
more structured approach, to allocate on the basis of perceptions of need. History
of past use and some annual percentage increase for each allocation area is a little
more formal; it is probably one of the most widely employed methods. Allo-
cating on the basis of organizational structure (main and branch units) is still
more formal (often, the allocation is a fixed percentage of the fund pool). Adding
to that method some incremental funding based on workload (such as circulation
data), moves the library closer to the formula end of the continuum. Also, some-
where in the middle of the continuum is the format allocation method (such as
funds for books, serials, audiovisual, electronic resources, and reference).
</p>
<p>Format allocation may be as simple as dividing monies between mono-
graphic and serials purchase accounts. Even this &ldquo;easy&rdquo; division is no longer so,
because serials prices increase more rapidly than other materials costs. How long
can a library shift monies from other accounts to maintain serials subscription
levels without damaging the overall collection? Libraries employ several cate-
gory allocation methods in addition to format, such as subject, unit, users, lan-
guage, and formula. Most libraries that use a format allocation system use
several approaches. Many small libraries, including most school media centers,
employ the format system, with monographs, serials, and audiovisuals being
the broad groupings. The library divides these funds by subject (e.g., language
arts), grade level (e.g., fifth grade), or user group (e.g., professional reading).
Occasionally, libraries divide monograph funds into current, retrospective, and
replacement categories. In libraries using approval, blanket order, or standing
order plans, it is normal practice to set aside monies for each program before
making any other allocations. A typical approach would be to set aside an
</p>
<p>310 14&mdash;Fiscal Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>amount equal to the prior year&rsquo;s expenditure for the category with an additional
amount to cover expected inflation. The reason for setting aside these funds first
is that they are ongoing commitments.
</p>
<p>Formula allocations have become more and more popular, especially in
large libraries. Librarians have proposed many formulas over the years, but no
one formula has become standard. Each library must decide which, if any, for-
mula is most appropriate for its special circumstances. A 1992 article by Ian R.
Young described a project that compared seven formulas.7 His results showed
that, although each formula employed one or more unique variables, there were
no statistically significant differences among the formula results in terms of a
single institution. He concluded that there was a high degree of similarity among
the seven formulas, at least when applied to his institutional setting. Based on our
experience with formulas and the selection of a formula in several institutional
settings, we would say that the library selects the formula that contains all the
variables necessary to satisfy all the interested parties. (Thus, political rather
than practical considerations dictate which formula is used.) Only quantifiable
factors (for example, average price, number of titles published, and use data) can
be used as variables in formulas. This does not mean that subjective judgments
do not play a role, but the allocation process as a whole depends on weightings,
circulation data, production figures, inflation and exchange rates, number of us-
ers, and so forth. Figure 14.7, page 312, shows the allocation formula used at
Loyola Marymount University.

<p>ALA&rsquo;s Guide to Budget Allocation for Information Resources indicates
that there are six broad allocation methods: historical, zero-based (no consider-
ation of past practice), formulas, ranking (a variation of formulas), percentages,
and other modeling techniques.8 The book also outlines some of the variations in
formulas by type of library. For example, academic libraries might consider en-
rollment by major or degrees granted in a field (the factors used in Figure 14.7
are widely used in academic libraries as well). Public libraries might factor in
differences in the service communities being served, the ratio of copies per title
of bestsellers to general titles, or the demand (in terms of use or requests) in pop-
ular subject fields. Special libraries employ factors such as delivery time expec-
tations of the clients, service chargebacks, and the number of clients or
departments served. Many school media centers use factors like changes in cur-
riculum, number and ability of students by grade level, and loss and aging rates
of various subject areas in the collection. The guide provides a starting point for
librarians thinking about changing the allocation process their library uses.
</p>
<p>Allocating funds is an involved process, and changing an existing method
is almost more difficult than establishing a new one. Often, past practices and
political issues keep the process from moving forward or evolving. Serials infla-
tion rates (almost 700 percent since 1970)9 make it difficult to provide both on-
going subscriptions and a reasonable level of monographic acquisitions. How
much to allocate to current materials and how much to allocate to retrospective
purchases is related, in part, to the serials inflation rate. If the decision is to main-
tain serials at the expense of monographs, in time there will be a significant need
for retrospective buying funds to fill in gaps in the monograph collection. Sub-
ject variations also complicate the picture. Science materials are very expensive;
social science materials are substantially less costly but are more numerous.
Electronic access, rather than local ownership, also clouds the picture, especially
because electronic access often involves cost at the individual level, something
with which allocation models have not dealt. Although allocation work fre-
quently involves political issues and occasionally involves upset individuals, in
the long run careful attention to this process will produce a better collection for
the organization the library or information center serves.
</p>
<p>���"+#����%
</p>
<p>One aspect of accounting and financial management in collection develop-
ment that differs from typical accounting practice is the process of encumbering.
This is a process that allows the library to set aside monies to pay for ordered
items. When the library waits 60, 90, or 120 days or more for orders, there is
some chance that the monies available will be over- or underspent if there is no
system that allows for setting aside monies.
</p>
<p>The following chart shows how the process works. Day 1, the first day of
the fiscal year, shows the library with an annual allocation of $1,000 for a partic-
ular subject area. On day 2, the library orders an item with a list price of $24.95.
Although there may be shipping and handling charges, there probably will be a
discount. Because none of the costs and credits are known at the time, the list
price is the amount a staff member records as encumbered. The unexpended
</p>
<p>Encumbering 313</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>column reflects the $24.95 deduction, although there is still nothing in the ex-
pended category. Sixty-two days later, the item and invoice arrive; the invoice
reflects a 15 percent discount ($3.74) and no shipping or handling charges. The
bookkeeper records the actual cost ($21.21) under expended and adds the $3.74
to the unexpended amount. The amount encumbered now is zero.
</p>
<p>Unexpended Encumbered Expended
</p>
<p>Day 1 $1000.00 0 0
</p>
<p>Day 2 $975.05 $24.95 0
</p>
<p>Day 62 $978.79 0 $21.21
</p>
<p>This system is much more complex than the example suggests, because li-
braries place and receive multiple orders every day. With each transaction the
amounts in each column change. The library seldom knows the precise balance,
except on the first and last day of the fiscal year. If the funding body takes back
all unexpended funds at the end of the fiscal year (a cash accounting system), the
acquisitions department staff must know the fund(s) balances as they enter the
final quarter of the year.
</p>
<p>Several factors make it difficult to learn the exact status of the funds, even
with the use of encumbrance. One factor is delivery of orders. Vendors may as-
sure customers they will deliver before the end of the fiscal year but fail to do so.
Such a failure can result in the encumbered money being lost. With a cash sys-
tem, the acquisitions department staff must make some choices at the end of the
fiscal year if there are funds in the encumbered category. The main issue is deter-
mining if the items still on order are important enough to leave on order. An affir-
mative answer has substantial implications for collection development. Using
the foregoing example and assuming that day 62 comes after the start of a new
fiscal year and the new allocation is $1,000, on day 1 of the new fiscal year, the
amount unexpended would be $975.05 ($1,000 minus $24.95), encumbered
$24.95, and expended zero. In essence, there is a reduction in the amount avail-
able for new orders and the library lost $24.95 from the prior year&rsquo;s allocation.
(One of the authors once took over as head of a library on June 25, and the system
financial officer reported the entire acquisitions allocation was encumbered for
the coming fiscal year, starting July 1. To have some funds for collection devel-
opment over the next twelve months, it was necessary to cancel 347 orders.)
</p>
<p>With an accrual system, the unexpended funds carry forward into the next
fiscal year. Under such a system, using the previous example, the day 1 figures
would be unexpended $1,000, encumbered $24.95, and expended zero.
</p>
<p>314 14&mdash;Fiscal Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The staff also needs to consider how reliable the vendor or producer is, be-
cause occasionally an item never arrives. How long should the library wait? The
answer varies from producer to producer and country to country. If the library
buys substantial amounts from developing countries, waiting several years is not
unreasonable. Because print runs tend to be very close to the number of copies on
order, the chance of never being able to acquire the item makes it dangerous to
cancel the order.
</p>
<p>There is a problem in leaving funds encumbered for long periods under
either system, especially when there is rapid inflation or exchange rates are unfa-
vorable. The latter are two reasons why a firm but reasonable date for automatic
cancellation of unfilled orders is important.
</p>
<p>Other factors making it difficult to know the precise fund balance during
the year are pricing and discounts. Prices are subject to change without notice on
most library materials, particularly online resources, which means the price may
be higher on delivery than when ordered. In addition, discounts are unpredict-
able. Because of the uncertainty, most libraries encumber the list price without
freight charges and hope the amount will be adequate. Exchange rates enter the
picture for international acquisitions, and the question of when the rate is set can
be a critical issue. Certainly, the rate is not firm on the date the order is placed,
but is it firm at the time of shipment, the date of the invoice, the date the library
receives the invoice and items, the date the financial office makes out the check,
or even the date the supplier deposits the check? With international orders, li-
braries can expect four months or more to elapse between order placement and
delivery. In periods of rapid rate changes, even a four-month difference can sig-
nificantly affect the amount of money available for purchases.
</p>
<p>Shipping and handling rates and taxes on items purchased have taken a toll
on the funds available for additions to the collection. Vendors that in the past
paid for shipping now pass the cost to customers. The U.S. Postal Service has
reduced the difference between postal rates such as the book rate and parcel post.
In 1970 it cost $0.18 to ship a two-pound book; in 1980 it cost $0.80; by 1999 the
rate was $1.54; and in 2001 the cost had risen to $2.38. All the charges on the
invoice (postage, handling, shipping, taxes, and so forth) must come from the
acquisitions budget. As these charges mount there is less money for the items the
library wishes to add.
</p>
<p>The point of all this work is to allow the library to spend all the materials
funds available in a timely manner without over-ordering. Remember that an
order is a legal contract between the library and the supplier. Certainly most sup-
pliers who have a long-standing relationship with libraries will be understanding
of an occasional over-commitment of funds, but they have a legal right to full,
prompt payment for all orders placed. One way they allow libraries to handle the
problem is to ship the order on time but hold the invoice until the start of the next
fiscal year.
</p>
<p>Encumbering 315</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A major problem confronting a bookkeeper in the acquisitions department
is the number of accounts with allocations. In some libraries the number may run
over 200. Restricted funds are especially problematic because the library may
charge only certain types of materials to the account. Although the bookkeeper&rsquo;s
job may be to assign charges to the various accounts, that person also must know
approximately how much money remains as free balance, as encumbered, and as
expended. As the number of accounts goes up, so does the bookkeeper&rsquo;s work-
load.
</p>
<p>Moving monies back and forth, especially in a manual system, can lead to
errors, so the acquisitions department must have a good bookkeeper. Automated
accounting systems speed the recording activities and provide greater accuracy,
as long as the data entry is correct. Despite the uncertainty that exists with the
encumbering system, it is still better than just having unexpended and expended
categories, because without it libraries would not know how much of the unex-
pended balance was actually needed for items on order.
</p>
<p> &amp;"�����
</p>
<p>Most government accounting methods, as well as the methods used by
many other organizations,use a voucher system. A voucher provides verification
of all transactions involving expenditures and the authorization for such expen-
ditures. It is a form that both summarizes an expenditure and carries the signa-
tures vouching for its correctness. Further, it authorizes entry into the books and
approves payment of charges. Libraries do not usually issue vouchers as such;
however, the requirement of the librarian&rsquo;s signature on a purchase order and on
invoices is part of the voucher system of the library&rsquo;s parent organization (city,
university, school district, etc.).
</p>
<p>Without a voucher, there will be no payment to a vendor. Because it takes a
long time for a voucher to make its way through a government system, a substan-
tial amount of correspondence can occur between the library and vendors regard-
ing when payments will take place. This points to the need for accurate
bookkeeping records and close cooperation between bookkeepers in the acquisi-
tions department and the authority that finally issues the checks or voucher.
</p>
<p>&amp;�'��3�� &amp;�����&amp;�
�&amp;�
</p>
<p>Bookkeepers control the vendor&rsquo;s compliance with the library&rsquo;s governing
agency&rsquo;s fiscal regulations. For example, they are responsible for checking in-
voices for all the required information: signature, purchase order number, and so
forth. If materials on prepaid orders do not arrive by the end of the fiscal year, the
library will request a refund because the vendor may want to hold the money as a
credit for future orders. As noted previously, it is very convenient to work with
the same vendors, because they become familiar with the library&rsquo;s payment pro-
cedures. Whenever a library selects a new vendor, it is wise to send a letter ex-
plaining the library&rsquo;s financial arrangements and why it may take up to three
months to receive payment.

</p>
<p>One difficulty facing the bookkeeper is knowing precisely where the li-
brary stands financially. The encumbered amount is always greater than the
amount expended because some items have discounts but not others. Some
monthly routines are part of the acquisitions department&rsquo;s bookkeeper workload.
One such routine is the reconciliation of the library&rsquo;s estimate of its financial sta-
tus with that of the supervising agency. The agency that oversees the library&rsquo;s
expenditure of funds will probably not list all of the separate funds used inter-
nally. Rather, it will show only the amount allocated to the library to buy library
materials. How the library distributes the funds is of no interest to the agency, as
long as the monies actually go for materials for the collection. The agency&rsquo;s con-
cern is with two categories of funds: expended and unexpended.
</p>
<p>The library has a third category of money&mdash;encumbered funds&mdash;that
makes reconciliation complex. As part of the reconciliation process, the book-
keeper normally creates for each library fund a statement of its unencumbered
balance, encumbered funds, and liquidated or expended funds. When selectors
have budgetary responsibility, monthly statements go to them so that they know
their available balance. The final reconciliation sheet shows when the library
received an invoice, the dealer&rsquo;s invoice number, the amount of money encum-
bered, and the discount received. The next column (net) indicates the amount ac-
tually paid to the dealer for the items; the tax column represents the tax on the
monies expended.
</p>
<p>The library must also carry out a number of end-of-fiscal-year routines, and
the bookkeeper is responsible for many of these. The library is normally on a
one-year fiscal cycle. That is, any money remaining in the library&rsquo;s budget at the
end of the fiscal year reverts to the funding agency. Libraries seldom are able to
carry forward into the next fiscal year any unexpended funds, including encum-
bered funds. Therefore, several months prior to the end of the fiscal year, it is
necessary to check with the vendors on outstanding orders to determine whether
they will make delivery in time. If they are unable to deliver the items before the
fiscal year ends, libraries usually cancel the order and place one for something
that is available or will be before the end of the fiscal year. This year-end exer-
cise can create bookkeeping nightmares.
</p>
<p>The bookkeeper&rsquo;s primary duty is to ensure that the library neither over-
spends nor underspends its budget. Because discounts and cancellations are
unknown quantities up until the moment the invoice arrives, it becomes a chal-
lenge for the bookkeeper to estimate accurately just where the library stands
financially.

</p>
<p>Are audits really necessary in libraries? Must we remember how, where,
when, and on what we spent every cent? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Not
many years ago, Herbert Synder and Julia Hersberger published an article outlin-
ing embezzlement in public libraries.10
</p>
<p>One aspect of having the power to manage and expend substantial amounts
of money is fiscal accountability. The amount of money does not need to be
&ldquo;substantial&rdquo; if it involves public or private funds. The process of establishing
how well libraries have handled the monies they are responsible for expending is
the audit.
</p>
<p>A legalistic definition of an audit is the process of &ldquo;accumulation and evalua-
tion of evidence about quantifiable information of an economic entity to deter-
mine and report on the degree of correspondence between the information and
established criteria.&rdquo;11 More simply put, it is the process of ensuring that the fi-
nancial records are accurate and that the information is presented correctly using
accepted accounting practices, and of making recommendations for improve-
ments in how the process is carried out. The basic questions and required records
relate to whether the purchase was made with proper authorization, was re-
ceived, and was paid for in an appropriate manner, and whether the item is still
available. (If the item is not still available, there should be appropriate records re-
garding its disposal.) With automated acquisitions systems, undergoing an audit
is less time-consuming than in the past, where the &ldquo;paper trail&rdquo; was in fact a num-
ber of different paper records that had to be gathered up and compared. At least
now the system can pull up the necessary information fairly quickly.
</p>
<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>Fiscal management, bookkeeping, and a basic understanding of how
trained bookkeepers do their work is important in an acquisitions department. Li-
braries are accountable for the funds they receive, and the acquisitions depart-
ment is one of the few places in the library where library funds are committed to
obligations. For most libraries, the two largest segments of the budget are staff
salaries and monies to build the collections. Only the collection development
funds are actually available for the staff to expend. It is important for the staff to
understand and use proper bookkeeping methods. This chapter covers only the
most elementary aspects of accounting. The concepts and terms that technical
services staff should be familiar with include account, balance sheet, credit, day-
book, debit, double-entry accounting, journalizing, ledger, posting, encumber-
ing, trail balance, voucher, account reconciliation, and audit. Additional
resources are listed in the Suggested Reading section.

<p>Libraries must constantly be aware of changes in prices and in invoicing
practices to gain the maximum number of additions to the collection. Watch for
changes, and demand explanations of freight and handling charges, inappropri-
ate dual-pricing systems, or other costs that may place additional strain on the
budget. By understanding basic accounting principles and using the reports and
records generated by the library&rsquo;s accounting system, the library will be better
able to monitor the use of available monies and use them effectively to meet the
needs of the public.

<p>Materials acquired for library collections must be made accessible to the
library users who want them. Most libraries&mdash;even small ones&mdash;have many
thousands of materials stored on-site and available electronically. As a result,
materials cannot be offered at random to library users. Materials should be orga-
nized well so users can find what they want quickly and easily. Providing access
involves organizing large numbers of materials for efficient retrieval of any sin-
gle item from the entire collection.
</p>
<p>Access generally takes two forms: direct and indirect. Direct access to
materials themselves is accomplished through organized shelving or, in the elec-
tronic world, through the ability to call up the full text of a document. Direct ac-
cess sometimes is called &ldquo;physical access,&rdquo; because large numbers of library
materials are objects such as books, videos, and so forth, stored physically on the
shelves. Library users can go directly to the shelves and find what they want or
browse until they do. Indirect access, also known as &ldquo;bibliographic access,&rdquo; &ldquo;in-
tellectual access,&rdquo; &ldquo;catalog access,&rdquo; and, for electronic materials, &ldquo;metadata,&rdquo;
means supplying information about the materials that will lead library users to
the materials themselves. Indirect access is accomplished by putting detailed
information about the materials into a searchable catalog. Cataloging and classi-
fying the materials are the ways libraries create both types of access.

</p>
<p>When a title is acquired, technical services staff members keep records that
document the transactions involved, such as placing the order for the title, re-
ceiving it, and paying for it. Cataloging operations often start with basic informa-
tion from the acquisition record, and edit or add to it to produce a complete and
accurate record for the material called a bibliographic record&mdash;&ldquo;bib&rdquo; record for
short. The record includes a full description of the material and its contents. Part

<p>of the cataloging process is the assignment of a call number or shelf address
where the material will be placed if it is stored in-house, or directions about how
to obtain it if it is not.
</p>
<p>Bib records for each title acquired are put in the public catalog in several
places library users expect to find them, such as under their titles, the name(s) of
the author(s), and words indicating their subjects. Searchable titles, names, and
subject words are called headings, and there are rules that govern their selection
and formatting. These are not the only possible headings. Some catalogs can also
be searched by call numbers, languages, publication dates, academic course
numbers, and other elements.
</p>
<p>Bib records are the basis for inventory control files kept by a library for every
item in its stock of materials (shelflist) and for borrowing by library users (circu-
lation). The catalog is thus simultaneously a valuable tool for library users and
reference librarians to use in finding materials they need and an internal tool for
keeping track of library collections.
</p>
<p>#�#��&amp;%��(�����&amp;�
�&amp;�
</p>
<p>Cataloging is said to produce &ldquo;bibliographic control.&rdquo; What does this
mean? The first word refers to materials (&ldquo;bibliographic&rdquo; = relating to books, ar-
ticles, or other documents) and the second to managing or manipulating them
(&ldquo;control&rdquo;). &ldquo;Bibliographic&rdquo; once referred solely to books, but now it includes
materials in all physical formats. The goal of bibliographic control in libraries is
to identify the materials the library has to offer its users and, at the same time, to
manage them all effectively.
</p>
<p>How can bibliographic control be created? The method librarians have em-
ployed for hundreds of years is to create records that substitute a small amount of
data for each item collected and file them all in a catalog, which can be searched
in place of physically examining the entire collection when something is wanted.
If cataloging is the process by which libraries produce the records that enable
them to provide bibliographic control, the catalog is the principal end product of
the process. Catalogs are the tools by which libraries identify the materials they
have and through which they manage them.

<p>In 1876, Charles A. Cutter first published his cataloging manual, Rules for
a Dictionary Catalog. It opened with what has become the most famous expres-
sion of the functions of the catalog, which he called its &ldquo;objects&rdquo;:
</p>
<p>1. To enable a person to find a book when one of the following is known:
</p>
<p>a) The author
b) The title
c) The subject
</p>
<p>326 15&mdash;Cataloging&mdash;Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. To show what the library has
</p>
<p>d) By a given author
e) On a given subject
f) In a given kind of literature
</p>
<p>3. To assist in the choice of a book
</p>
<p>g) As to the edition (bibliographically)
h) As to its character (literary or topical).1
</p>
<p>Despite much research and analysis on cataloging questions since Cutter&rsquo;s
time, his objects remain the definitive statement of what catalogs try to accom-
plish. They sound simple, but Cutter&rsquo;s ideals have never been completely real-
ized. They remain goals toward which to strive, achievable only in theory.
</p>
<p>The reason Cutter&rsquo;s objects are difficult to attain is that the kinds of actions
that promote finding a book when the author, title, or subject is known (the iden-
tity function) work against gathering related works to show all works by a given
author, in a given subject, or to assist readers in choosing editions or genres (the
managing function), and vice versa. For example, if one copy of Beethoven&rsquo;s
last symphony uses the title Symphony No. 9 and gives the author&rsquo;s name as
Luigi van Beethoven (as he occasionally signed himself) and another uses the title
Ninth Symphony and gives the author&rsquo;s name as Ludwig van Beethoven, the fol-
lowing problems occur:
</p>
<p>1. If the titles and names are used exactly as they appear on each of these
scores, which promotes their identification, neither the names nor the
titles will file together.
</p>
<p>2. If one form of the title and one form of the author&rsquo;s name is used for
both scores, which promotes proper management by keeping them to-
gether, the headings will file neatly in the same place, but the library
will have used names and titles that cannot be found on the scores
themselves.
</p>
<p>Current cataloging and classification rules come close to achieving both
functions of the catalog. The rules for headings for names, subjects, and series
titles generally permit only one form to be used for all occurrences of each name,
subject, or series title. This brings together all the works by an author, all works
on a particular topic, and all works in the same series, regardless of discrepancies
in vocabulary, spelling, language, and other elements that could occur. A special
heading called a &ldquo;uniform title&rdquo; is created for works whose own titles vary on
different versions (as in the example of the Beethoven symphony). The uniform
title brings together all editions and versions of a title, just as the one permissible
name, subject, and series title headings do.
</p>
<p>The rules that pertain to the identification of a work, called its &ldquo;biblio-
graphic description&rdquo; often require the exact transcription of data from the item
being cataloged. This ensures that someone who uses the catalog record can
</p>
<p>Functions of the Catalog 327</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>match it exactly against a copy of the item it represents, confirming that the cor-
rect item has been found. Transcribed edition information in the bibliographic
description enables different editions of the same work to be identified and orga-
nized. Title headings consisting of the exact title transcribed in the bibliographic
description also facilitate successful matching. When one work is published in
many versions with varying titles, two title headings are made for each version
cataloged: one that exactly matches the title on the item, thus helping searchers
match it, and one authorized uniform title that gathers the variations in one place
in the catalog.
</p>
<p>Even in their imperfect state, catalogs accomplish a great deal. They are the
keys to library collections everywhere, helping people find the materials they
seek in any particular place. Catalogs help form links between collections, en-
abling one institution to share information and materials with others. Shelf
arrangements also contribute to access by physically collocating materials that
are related, first by subject, then within a subject by author, and finally by the
titles of an author&rsquo;s work in a subject.
</p>
<p>Good cataloging and classification accomplish two things. First, they do a
better job as reference tools for the materials in the library, and second, they en-
able a library to link more effectively with partners in local, county, regional,
state, provincial, and national bibliographic networks. The ultimate goal of these
networks is to make any title owned anywhere available to a person with a need
for that material.
</p>
<p>��
��&amp;%�'��(��)�
</p>
<p>Catalog information may be presented to library users in one of the follow-
ing types of displays: books, cards, microfilms or microfiches, or computer
screens. Typically, catalogs in twenty-first-century libraries are electronic data-
bases mounted on computers, called online public access catalogs (OPACs) or
public access catalogs (PACs). Card catalogs still are used in libraries that have
not computerized their operations, but each type has enjoyed a measure of popu-
larity at different times. Book catalogs were popular until the latter part of the
nineteenth century, after which they were replaced by card catalogs. Microfilm
and microfiche catalogs were an interim stage between card catalogs and com-
puterized catalogs in the 1970s and early 1980s, but few examples remain in use.
Some libraries choose to create microform or printed book catalogs from their
electronic databases, but most prefer to utilize the database directly via computers.
</p>
<p>Examples of book catalogs&mdash;either printed or handwritten listings&mdash;going
back to medieval times have been documented by library historians and were
generally used by libraries in North America until the end of the nineteenth cen-
tury.2 Printed books were easy to duplicate and distribute; they could even be
sold, if a market existed. However, book catalogs could not be kept up to date ex-
cept by printing new editions, which was a great deal of work and could be very
costly. When cards were introduced, their ability to facilitate updating the cata-
log easily by interfiling new cards among the existing ones far outweighed the
disadvantages that it was hard to duplicate and distribute them to multiple loca-
tions. For that reason, libraries rapidly adopted cards.
</p>
<p>328 15&mdash;Cataloging&mdash;Overview</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>By the middle of the twentieth century, &ldquo;card catalog&rdquo; was a synonym for
&ldquo;library catalog.&rdquo; Early on, when new materials were added to the collection,
cards for them could be prepared and filed immediately or within days; similarly,
when older materials were withdrawn from the collection or deemed lost by li-
brary users, the cards could be removed quickly. Later, significant time lags be-
tween receipt of new materials and cataloging began to occur, the result of an
&ldquo;information explosion&rdquo; in which greatly increased acquisitions outstripped cat-
alogers&rsquo; ability to deal with them. Materials awaiting cataloging accumulated,
and in some institutions it could take months&mdash;even years&mdash;before cards for a
new title were prepared and filed. Similarly, removing the cards for older titles
that were withdrawn or lost could take as long or longer, depending on the prior-
ity attached to this type of catalog maintenance. Huge backlogs of uncataloged
materials and unfiled cards were a constant reminder that card catalogs were fail-
ing to function well, especially in large libraries.
</p>
<p>Research into using computers for library catalogs began to produce results
in the 1960s. Bibliographic data vary a great deal, and individual records contain
large numbers of elements and characters. These were obstacles that had to be
addressed by developers. Software had to accommodate numerous elements and
subelements in catalog records&mdash;everything from complex call numbers, biblio-
graphic descriptions, and multiple headings, to publishers&rsquo; numbers and order
numbers assigned by the Library of Congress to the card sets it sold. Hardware
had to have enough storage space for the data, indexes, and retrieval software.
Fortunately, within a few years computer capacity expanded, costs dropped, and
programming became ever more sophisticated. Newer, better, smaller comput-
ers continued to be built in the 1970s and 1980s, while costs continued to drop
and search software to improve. By the middle of the 1980s, computerized cata-
logs mounted on minicomputers and microcomputers began replacing the old
card files, which had ruled for nearly a century.
</p>
<p>The way catalog records look in book catalogs, on cards, or on computer
screens may be very much alike or differ considerably. Whereas books and cards
benefited from minimizing the size of each record as well as the total number of
records in the catalog,3 computerized catalogs currently offer far greater capaci-
ties for both longer records and more of them, filing, matching, and retrieving re-
cords automatically. Early OPAC screens imitated the look of data on cards, one
interface even enclosing the data in an outline of a card, complete with a hole at
the bottom (used in card catalogs for a rod that kept the cards anchored in their
trays). Newer OPACs are experimenting with entirely different displays, some
adding prefixes that identify each element in a line-by-line listing, and offering
brief records at first and fuller records on request, and so forth. A selection of
OPAC screen styles is shown in Figures 15.1, 15.2, and 15.3, pages 330&ndash;32.
</p>
<p>Catalog records for an individual library&rsquo;s public catalog can be prepared
within the library technical services unit in a cataloging department or purchased
from external sources. Both types of catalog preparation have long traditions, al-
though until the advent of computers, the final steps of incorporating records
from external sources into local catalog files generally involved several opera-
tions for which each individual library was responsible.
</p>
<p>Catalog Displays 329</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In the twenty-first century, purchased catalog records may be further edited
by the staff of the library, or simply used as purchased in the library OPAC.
Thus, in-house library cataloging operations are divided into two subunits: (1)
original cataloging, which creates catalog records for items &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo;; and
(2) copy cataloging (also called &ldquo;derived&rdquo; cataloging), which takes purchased
bibliographic data from outside sources and processes it for the local catalog.
Some small libraries have no cataloging department at all, using whatever data is
purchased without further processing.
</p>
<p>Much of the information covered in Part Three describes the steps of origi-
nal cataloging. By understanding how catalog records are created, librarians are
empowered to do more than prepare new records, though it does that. They
should also be able to do a better job of selecting external sources for local cata-
loging and ensuring that the local catalog provides searchers with good biblio-
graphic service, even if they do not prepare the records themselves.

<p>A Word About the Examples. Examples in Part Three have been provided to
illustrate different standard cataloging styles. In their descriptive cataloging,
some examples contain smaller amounts of information, called &ldquo;Level 1&rdquo; de-
scription, whereas others have more information, called &ldquo;Level 2&rdquo; description.
These &ldquo;Levels&rdquo; are defined in Chapter 16 and identified in the examples. To
match the varying choices of subject tools used in practice, wherever first level
description is done, the subject headings are taken from Sears List of Subject
Headings and classification numbers from the abridged Dewey Decimal Classi-
fication; wherever second level description is done, subject headings come from
Library of Congress Subject Headings and classification numbers from the un-
abridged Dewey Decimal Classification. Examples that use Library of Congress

<p>���������
</p>
<p>Many decisions are made before cataloging can begin, but the one to adopt
standard cataloging practices is the most important. As a result, the Anglo-American
Cataloguing Rules, second edition, 1998 revision (AACR2-98) automatically
becomes the tool for creating bibliographic descriptions and selecting headings
associated with the description.1 Other decisions&mdash;for example, how to provide
subject access and what classification to use for arranging materials on the
shelves&mdash;are also discussed in this chapter.
</p>
<p>�&amp;��+"���'�
�!6�� ����&amp;*�'�����(
�&amp;�
</p>
<p>Unlike previous codes, which offered a single standard style of description,
AACR2-98 prescribes three different styles, one of which must be selected for
an institution&rsquo;s original cataloging. The styles are called &ldquo;levels of description&rdquo;
and differ in the amount of data each one contains. Level 1 description is the sim-
plest and contains the least information. Level 3 is the most complex. Level
2 contains more information than Level 1, but less than Level 3. Level 2 is the
style recommended by bibliographic networks and used for derived (or &ldquo;copy&rdquo;)
cataloging.
</p>
<p>Level 1 descriptions may be adequate for small general purpose collections
used by young people and adult nonspecialists. Level 2 (and 3) descriptions can
include more information than these searchers require as well as being more
time-consuming and costly to produce. However, although they satisfy
AACR2-98&rsquo;s standards, Level 1 records are not considered full records by na-
tional bibliographic networks. A decision to adopt Level 1 should be made care-
fully, considering a library&rsquo;s future as well as immediate needs. If the library is
likely to grow rapidly, Level 2 should be considered, even if it is not necessary at
the moment.
</p>
<p>334
</p>
<p>��</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AACR2-98 Level 1 descriptions and less-than-full-level cataloging ac-
cepted by computerized networks are not defined in quite the same way. In fact,
every library that uses any form of less-than-full cataloging&mdash;called minimal
level cataloging&mdash;seems to have its own idea of what the records should contain.
Some include one subject heading or two descriptive headings. Others do not
permit either of these &ldquo;luxuries.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Research libraries do minimal level cataloging for some of their materials,
because otherwise their cataloging backlogs would become unmanageable. To-
gether with a group of cooperating libraries known as the Program for Coopera-
tive Cataloging (PCC), the Library of Congress has helped develop a standard
for less-than-second-level cataloging known as the &ldquo;core&rdquo; record. Core records
include access points that are expected to conform to current standards for each
heading type and include the associated authority work. The PCC aims for good
catalog records containing enough strictly accurate data for searchers to be able
to locate and identify the materials represented. The PCC has formulated a set of
values to guide its work and a training program to ensure that its members&rsquo; con-
tributed cataloging is of the same high quality as if it were full-level cataloging.
PCC member libraries include some of the U.S. and Canada&rsquo;s most prestigious
institutions.
</p>
<p>Level 2 bibliographic descriptions require that more rules be applied and
more details included in the records. It is the level usually chosen by large and
medium-sized general libraries whose catalogs are used for research purposes. It
also is required by bibliographic networks to meet full-level input standards
(although simpler cataloging is acceptable also as long as it is appropriately
identified).
</p>
<p>Level 3 is the fullest form of description, requiring that every applicable
rule and all available information from an item being cataloged be included in
catalog records. Few libraries follow it for routine materials, not even the Library
of Congress or university research libraries, which do second-level descriptive
cataloging. One appropriate use of Level 3 is for materials in special collections,
where researchers might need the detailed information provided by this level of
treatment. It should not be adopted unless decision-makers are certain it serves
clearly defined purposes, because the work of adding extra information to cata-
log records is time-consuming and costly, and wasteful if searchers routinely ig-
nore it.
</p>
<p>The information contained in bibliographic descriptions will determine the
headings that can be chosen as retrieval points (see Chapter 18). Higher level cat-
aloging maximizes the number of possible headings, while lower level catalog-
ing limits them.
</p>
<p>In this book, it is assumed that libraries will choose Level 2 as the appropri-
ate style for original cataloging. Examples are done at Level 2 unless a different
style is indicated. Figure 16.1, page 336, illustrates some of the differences be-
tween Level 1 and Level 2 cataloging, including the headings made as a result of
the choice of bibliographic level.

<p>This chapter has been discussing the objective aspects of items being cata-
loged. The subject matter or content of each item being cataloged also must be
identified and represented in the catalog. Indexing, also known as subject cata-
loging, is the process of identifying an item&rsquo;s subject matter and selecting words
to represent those contents in the catalog. The words chosen for this purpose are
called subject headings or subject descriptors.
</p>
<p>Subject headings can and should be standardized by selecting them from a
published list of authorized terms known as a subject authority. Some subject au-
thorities cover all subject matter, whereas others cover limited topical areas,
such as science or law. In cataloging, subject authorities that are limited in scope
are referred to as thesauri. Thesauri tend to be used by special libraries and infor-
mation centers whose collections, while small, contain many highly specialized
materials. Libraries with general collections, which include most academic, pub-
lic, and school libraries, use general subject authorities. Two general subject au-
thorities that have attained international recognition as standards and are used by
the majority of libraries in the United States and Canada are Sears List of Subject
Headings (Sears)2 and the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).3
These lists also have Canadian counterparts.4
</p>
<p>Sears is a small list, used primarily in small schools and public libraries. Its
broader, simpler headings are sufficient for the number and types of materials
they collect. LCSH, used by most large and medium-sized academic and public
libraries, may be a better choice if a small public library or school has large num-
bers of materials on some topics; is part of a larger group sharing cataloging data
that use LCSH, or hopes to join such a group in the future; or if it wishes to obtain
cataloging from outside sources likely to use LCSH. The initial decision to adopt
one of the two subject authorities, and any subsequent decision to change from
one to the other, should be made very carefully.
</p>
<p>The aim of the subject index is to bring together enough works in a topical
area to satisfy the needs of searchers looking for material in the area, but not to
overload them with retrieved works whose focus may be only marginally related
to their interests. Given their relative sizes and numbers of available headings, if
Sears and LCSH were used for the same collection, one could expect that the
Sears index would bring together many more items under fewer, broader terms
than the LCSH index.
</p>
<p>The decision over which subject list to use can be made by asking which
one brings together a better number of works&mdash;with &ldquo;better&rdquo; defined as not too
many and not too few. The answer will vary depending on the cataloger&rsquo;s subjec-
tive view of the ideal number of retrievals per heading. Knowing that some topics,
such as U.S. or Canadian history, will be heavily represented in any library
collection, the cataloger can make the choice based on how well such heavily
collected subject areas are treated or might exclude heavily collected subject
areas and make a choice based on how well the other subject areas are treated.
</p>
<p>Not only is LCSH a much larger compilation of terms than Sears, it tends to
use the scientific or technical terms for topics. This may or may not be appropri-
ate for the searchers who will use the catalog. An elementary school might wish
</p>
<p>338 16&mdash;Decisions</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>to avoid technical terms, but a secondary school or public library serving adults
might find them acceptable. If the group of searchers is heterogeneous, neither
choice will be perfect for everyone, but it should be geared to the needs of most
searchers. Librarians can assist the rest.
</p>
<p>Despite its size, LCSH does not have all the terms needed to index large
specialized collections in some subjects. Specialized subject authorities called
thesauri can be used in addition to, or in place of, LCSH. Thesauri often are spon-
sored by professional associations or leading special libraries such as the Na-
tional Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland, which sponsors the Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH),5 or the Getty Art History Project in Santa Monica,
California, which sponsors the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT).6 Special-
ized thesauri are not discussed in this book, but more information about them can
be found in Special Libraries: A Cataloging Guide.7
</p>
<p>Catalogers also can decide to supply subject headings for all materials or
only some of them. Traditional practices have long included subject headings for
all nonfiction, nonbook materials, and children&rsquo;s fiction, but excluded most adult
literary works from subject cataloging. In recent years, this exclusion has
evolved into a freer system of choice. The Library of Congress (LC) and other
professional leaders now encourage catalogers to assign subject headings to such
works using specially created genre headings as well as ordinary terms found in
topical and name authorities.
</p>
<p>������*���
�&amp;��
</p>
<p>Another important decision concerns the classification scheme selected to
arrange materials on the shelves. Like published subject authorities, which con-
trol the words used for subject headings, published classification schemes list
&ldquo;authorized&rdquo; subject categories and give codes for them, thus serving as classifi-
cation &ldquo;authorities.&rdquo; Catalogers call these published lists of categories and codes
classification schemes, classification systems, or, simply, classifications. The
codes themselves may consist of numbers, letters, symbols, or combinations of
numbers, letters, and/or symbols. The codes are referred to as classification num-
bers, regardless of the types of characters they contain.
</p>
<p>Classification numbers represent subject matter, very much like subject
headings. However, because an item can stand in only one place on the shelf, it
can bear only one classification number. Thus, the subject expression of classifi-
cation numbers is less precise than that of the combined group of subject head-
ings assigned to an item, because it must summarize the entire content with only
one number.
</p>
<p>Two standard general classification schemes dominate in the United States
and Canada: Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress.8 In both countries,
Dewey is the heavy favorite of school and public libraries regardless of their
size. In Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other Commonwealth countries,
it is used also by the national libraries for shelving their collections and arranging
their national bibliographies. In the United States, however, the Library of Con-
gress, which serves as the de facto national library, uses its own classification
scheme. When computer networks began distributing LC&rsquo;s cataloging records in
</p>
<p>Classifications 339</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the 1960s and 1970s, many colleges and universities adopted the LC classifica-
tion in order to copy them. Copying officially assigned LC numbers seemed
more economical and easier for their large collections than having to classify
each item &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; in the Dewey classification scheme.
</p>
<p>Before long, however, LC began assigning Dewey numbers as well in its
cataloging, and members of shared cataloging networks could choose to copy
either scheme. Dewey still is used by some large libraries in which research is a
primary function. An important disadvantage of switching classifications is that
all the previously acquired material has to be converted to the new scheme,
which is a costly project. Otherwise, the library&rsquo;s collection is divided between
two schemes, forcing librarians and users alike to deal with them both, searching
two places for every subject, fragmenting materials on the same subjects, and
destroying the collection&rsquo;s browsability.
</p>
<p>Local policy determines the classification scheme adopted by individual li-
braries. The classification numbers that result form the basis for call numbers,
the shelf addresses for materials in library collections. In addition, local policies
govern other marks, called shelf marks, added to classification numbers to com-
plete the call numbers. Shelf marks may include branch and/or collection desig-
nations, coded versions of main entries called cutter numbers, author letters,
dates, volume numbers, and so forth.
</p>
<p>&amp;
����'�����&amp;��
</p>
<p>Two decisions about how to deploy cataloging products will affect the effi-
ciency and effectiveness of a library&rsquo;s catalog and shelf arrangement. One is
whether to interfile all catalog records, and the other is whether to intershelve all
materials. Integrating the catalog accomplishes its objectives more fully than
keeping several separate catalogs and minimizes the steps a searcher must take to
locate materials of interest. The authors recommend putting cataloging for all
materials into one integrated catalog. This is also the method of choice for com-
puterized networks.
</p>
<p>Before the advent of OPACs, some librarians believed that searching
was more efficient in small files and divided their card catalogs into two
files: author/title and subject files. A user could fail to retrieve desired material
because of searching in the wrong file, e.g., &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; as sub-
jects were in the author/title file with &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; as an author&rsquo;s name and
&ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; as a title, while the subject file was limited to topical subject headings
(that is, nonname, nontitle). Something similar has happened with OPACs, al-
though the OPAC database might seem to be automatically integrated. In reality,
the degree of integration or division within an OPAC file is governed by the soft-
ware used for searching and retrieval operations. If the software requires the
searcher to select a file (author, title, subject, keyword, call number) before en-
tering a search statement, this automatically divides the file. Searchers must be
able to browse all the headings together without specifying a file&mdash;names and
titles as descriptive headings, names and titles as subject headings, and topical
subject headings&mdash;to achieve integrated searching and retrieval in an OPAC.
</p>
<p>340 16&mdash;Decisions</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Some libraries routinely apply core level standards to specialized mono-
graphs likely to be wanted by very few users (e.g., foreign-language books, pri-
mary research materials, and dissertations) and to ongoing publications such as
journals. Internal institutional publications are sometimes treated differently
than externally published materials, especially if access to them is limited to a
small number of users.
</p>
<p>The intershelving of all materials has had its proponents and detractors.
Studies show that all materials circulate better when they are intershelved, so this
is our recommendation.9 Many librarians believe that the best information on
some topics is contained in nonbook materials, but this information will be diffi-
cult to find and use if nonbook materials are kept out of sight in corners or locked
cabinets, while books are shelved on open stacks in full view.10
</p>
<p>On the other hand, libraries are free to choose different options for specific
types of materials and may have good reasons for doing so. Libraries acquire
materials that come in distinctly different packages: books, maps, slides, cas-
settes, tapes, discs, and so forth. It can be difficult to place items in all the pack-
ages together on the same shelves, and some types require repackaging if they
are to be housed comfortably with others. The difficulty of shelving different
packages together and the cost of repackaging some items are reasons often
given for failing to intershelve.
</p>
<p>Regular classification and shelving routines can be suspended for reasons
other than the accommodation of materials in different physical forms. Some li-
braries classify journals and shelve them in ordinary call number order. Others
prefer not to classify their journals, but arrange them alphabetically by title in a
separate location. Some libraries exclude fiction or biographies from classifica-
tion, shelving these, also, in separate locations in alphabetical order by the names
of the authors or biographees. (Students in Sheila Intner&rsquo;s cataloging classes as-
signed to identify all the different locations for literary works in their local public
libraries have found them in up to twenty different places in a single library, in-
cluding regular nonfiction call number ranges such as the Dewey 800s or the LC
Ps.) Some libraries maintain separate shelves for newly acquired materials, iden-
tifying them with special spine labels. Special spine labels are also employed to
identify types of genre fiction (science fiction, mysteries, westerns, etc.), some-
times in an integrated arrangement with ordinary fiction and sometimes in sepa-
rate blocks of shelves. Some Canadian libraries add maple leaf spine labels on
works by Canadian authors. Nor are these the only possibilities. Any variation
can be &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; for a particular library. Whenever some materials are
shelved out of call number order, signs that explain the anomalies are essential.
</p>
<p>Monographs issued in series11 require a special set of policy decisions. The
basic choice is whether to catalog the entire series as an ongoing collection or to
catalog each part individually when it is acquired. (Treatment of series data is
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 17.) If the choice is to treat the series as a
collection, only one catalog record will be made under the series title, encom-
passing all the parts, even though each part also has its own title and could stand
alone. If librarians want to provide information about the parts, their titles and
other pertinent data can be given in contents notes and headings made for them as
&ldquo;analytic&rdquo; (that is, &ldquo;part&rdquo;) title headings. The alternative is to treat each part as a
</p>
<p>Other Decisions 341</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>separate item with its own catalog record. To bring all the parts together in one
place in the catalog, the series title is given in each catalog record and a series title
heading made for it.
</p>
<p>Two issues can help guide the decision about how to treat monographic
series: (1) whether users seek individual parts more often than the collection and
(2) whether the subject matter of the parts is similar enough to merit being put in
just one classification number. If users are likely to want only one part, not the
whole collection, and if the subject of each part differs enough to warrant sepa-
rate classification numbers, cataloging each part individually seems the best
course. If users are likely to want the entire collection and the subjects are similar
enough to warrant shelving them together, treating all the parts as one collection
seems sensible. When a monographic series is cataloged as a collection, individ-
ual parts might not be listed in the catalog at all unless a contents note is made. If
the contents note is made, each part can be given a title heading in the catalog.
However, if a library chooses Level 1 cataloging, it is allowed to omit giving se-
ries titles and might choose not to provide contents notes. Then, no headings for
the individual parts can be made.
</p>
<p>Some catalogers establish one policy for all series, whereas others divide
them into two groups: those that will be treated collectively and those that will be
treated individually. The policy gives the criteria by which a new series is placed
in one group or the other. Some libraries try to recognize scholarly series but ig-
nore those that seem aimed primarily at mass marketing.
</p>
<p>Decisions on options such as these should be written down so staff and
users can consult them. However, no decision can serve all users equally well,
and what works well at one time may not succeed forever, so cataloging deci-
sions bear periodic review and evaluation. Monitoring reference queries can help
to confirm whether the library&rsquo;s current practices seem to help most users suc-
ceed in their searches or prevent users from finding the materials they want.
</p>
<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>Cataloging decisions relate to objective and subjective aspects of materials.
Procedures identifying objective aspects of materials (called manifestations of
cataloged works) fall under the rubric of descriptive cataloging. Descriptive cat-
aloging decisions include adopting AACR2-98 as a cataloging code, choosing an
appropriate amount of data to be included in bibliographic descriptions (the bib-
liographic level), and deciding whether to treat monographs issued in series indi-
vidually or collectively. Procedures identifying subjective aspects of materials,
which refer to their contents, fall under the twin rubrics of subject cataloging and
classification. Subjective decisions include selecting a subject authority as a
source for subject headings and a classification scheme as a source for classifica-
tion numbers. Both subject headings and classification numbers represent the
contents of cataloged materials, but the latter tend to be less precise, because cat-
alogers limit themselves to one classification number per cataloged item,
whereas they assign multiple subject headings.
</p>
<p>Descriptive cataloging, subject cataloging, and classification each operate
to provide access, although in different ways. Descriptive cataloging provides
</p>
<p>342 16&mdash;Decisions</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>headings for the identifying features of materials, such as the names of authors
and titles. This is known as bibliographic access, because authors and titles are
bibliographic features. Subject cataloging indexes the contents of items, result-
ing in the assignment of subject headings that furnish searchers with intellectual
access. Classification assigns numbers used in placing materials on the shelves
according to their contents, resulting in physical access to items in library collec-
tions (the shelf addresses where materials are located). It also provides some-
what less precise intellectual access than subject cataloging.
</p>
<p>Chapter 17 looks more closely at descriptive cataloging.

<p>A standard cataloging record begins by describing an item according to an
accepted set of rules&mdash;currently, the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, sec-
ond edition, 1998 revision.1 This chapter describes how bibliographic descrip-
tions are built and headings relating to them are derived.
</p>
<p>AACR2-98, the current standard, is available as a clothbound or paperback
book, on a CD-ROM disc, called AACR2-e; and in unbound, prepunched pages
that an owner of the loose-leaf binder edition can put in the old binder (new ones
are unavailable). AACR2-e can be licensed for use by one individual or, with a
site license, by several catalogers. It is also part of the Library of Congress&rsquo;s Cat-
aloger&rsquo;s Desktop product.2 AACR2-e employs FolioBound Views software for
access to the text, which is completely indexed, enabling catalogers to search by
any word in the text or by rule numbers. Search words can be truncated and com-
bined using AND, OR, and NOT. AACR2-e users can &ldquo;bookmark&rdquo; and highlight
items and annotate the text. Links help users move through the text quickly, and
multiple windows can display different pages of text simultaneously.

<p>In 1908, the first set of international cataloging rules was devised by a
group of British librarians working with a visiting party of American colleagues.
The meeting of minds from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean was disrupted
for a period during and after World War II, and the American Library Associa-
tion unilaterally published a new code in 1949. But joint efforts were to resume
before very long. In 1961, due in large part to the efforts of American theorist
Seymour Lubetzky, an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles was
convened in Paris. The meeting resulted in a statement of principles on which
cataloging rules should be based, known afterward as the Paris Principles.3
</p>
<p>345
</p>
<p>��</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Efforts following the Paris conference to forge an Anglo-American cata-
loging code resulted in the publication of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules
(AACR1) in 1967. Differences between British and North American librarians
could not be resolved, so AACR1 was published in one version for the British
and another for North Americans. Even the titles differed: the British used the
&ldquo;u&rdquo; in cataloguing; the North Americans dropped it.
</p>
<p>In 1974, AACR1&rsquo;s publishers formed the Joint Steering Committee for Re-
vision of AACR (JSC) to be the final authority on the rules. The result of their
efforts was a second edition that used British spellings, known as AACR2, pub-
lished in 1978 simultaneously by the American Library Association, Canadian
Library Association, and Library Association (United Kingdom). AACR2 has
since been reissued twice, in 1988 (AACR2R) and 1998 (AACR2-98), to incor-
porate subsequent revisions into one text.
</p>
<p>AACR2 was an integrated code for all materials. It followed the rules of
International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which provided a uni-
form outline consisting of eight bibliographic elements and a system for punctu-
ating them. The elements of description were already familiar to catalogers and
bibliographers (title, author, edition, publisher, etc.). The order in which they
should appear in catalog entries was formalized into ISBD by authority of the
International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) for use
all over the world. The punctuation&mdash;called confusing and superfluous by critics&mdash;
made catalog records from different countries understandable and interchange-
able for computer entry or for use by catalogers who did not know the language
in which the entry was written.
</p>
<p>The presence of a single order of elements of description for all materials
regardless of their physical form was a revolutionary concept in the early 1970s.
AACR2&rsquo;s developers also believed that headings chosen for items cataloged us-
ing the rules for description could be done in exactly the same way for any type
of material. Materials such as legal, religious, art, and musical works, and a few
others, were singled out for unique treatment, but not because of their physical
format. Generally, catalogers simply choose the best headings for an item based
on the information given in its description.
</p>
<p>In October 1997, a conference was convened in Toronto to assist JSC in
determining whether fundamental rule revision was needed and, if so, what its
nature and direction should be.4 Delegates, who came from ten nations, recom-
mended adding a statement of principles and functions of a catalog, changing the
rule stating that physical format is primary over content, revising the rules for
cataloging serials, and considering greater internationalization of AACR. Work
proceeds on these and other matters.5
</p>
<p>Rule revision is a slow process, and new formats sometimes appear in librar-
ies before rules for them are developed. Figure 17.1, pages 347&ndash;48, shows a
compact disc that is both sound recording and electronic resource, depending on
the hardware used. The item is cataloged with existing rules as a sound recording
because music is its focus. A note is made about its alternate use.

</p>
<p>AACR2-98 is divided into two main sections. The first section covers de-
scription of materials; the second covers their retrieval. Rules for retrieval in-
volve the choice and form of headings, called access points, based on the
description. The chapters in the first section are numbered in the ordinary way,
from 1 to 13. The chapters in the second section begin with Chapter 20 and are
then numbered consecutively, 21&ndash;26.
</p>
<p>Chapter 1 contains rules applying to all materials, to supplements, to items
made up of several types of materials, and to reproductions. Chapters 2 to 13
each cover a group of media. AACR2-98 rule numbers are mnemonic: The first
digit stands for the chapter and the second stands for the element of description.
After that, letters of the alphabet stand for subelements and roman numerals for
subdivisions of subelements. Rules relating to the title (first element of descrip-
tion) are numbered x.1, where x is the chapter (e.g., maps are covered in Chapter
3 and videorecordings in Chapter 7, so rules for map titles are numbered 3.1,
while rules for video titles are 7.1). This serves as a shorthand for specific rules.
</p>
<p>The first step in cataloging is to decide what the item is and select the appro-
priate rules to apply. Ask: &ldquo;Is this item made up of one part or more than one?&rdquo; If
there is just one part, next ask to which group it belongs, according to the follow-
ing choices:
</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Books, pamphlets, and printed sheets
</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Cartographic materials (maps, globes, etc.)
</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Manuscripts (including typescripts)
</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Music
</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Sound recordings
</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Motion pictures and videorecordings
</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Graphic materials (includes visual images of all kinds)
</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Electronic resources
</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Three-dimensional artefacts and realia (including toys,
games, and &ldquo;found&rdquo; objects)
</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Microforms
</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Serials (items issued in parts intended to continue
indefinitely)
</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Analysis (items that are part of a larger item)
</p>
<p>The corresponding chapter, with Chapter 1, is used to describe the item. To
catalog a serial, Chapter 12 and Chapter 1 are all that are needed for print-on-paper
items, but if it is in any other format (e.g., a serially issued sound recording,
</p>
<p>Organization of AACR2-98 349</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>videorecording, or electronic resource), three chapters are used: Chapter 1, the
chapter for the physical format, plus Chapter 12.
</p>
<p>If the item consists of more than one piece (except serials), ask: &ldquo;Are all the
pieces in one format?&rdquo; Examples are multidisc sound recordings and CD-ROMs,
and multivolume books. If the answer is &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; proceed in the same way as
above. Choose the appropriate chapter and begin. If the answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; ask: &ldquo;Is
one of the pieces more important than the rest?&rdquo; If so, the item is cataloged by the
chapter for that piece, called the predominant piece. All the other pieces are con-
sidered accompanying material. If the answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; or if at least two pieces in
different formats are equal in importance, the item is cataloged as a kit (or, if us-
ing the British interpretation of the rules, multimedia), using rule 1.10 (from
Chapter 1) and the chapters appropriate to the formats involved.
</p>
<p>Importance is subjective. A useful rule of thumb to judge importance is to
consider how the content of the item is conveyed. If each piece conveys the
whole content, none is most important and the item is a kit. If none conveys the
whole content and the pieces must be used together, there is no predominant
piece and the item still is a kit. But if one piece conveys the whole content and the
others do not, that piece is most important and the catalog record should be made
for it alone, with the other pieces treated as accompaniments. Figures 17.2 and
17.3 illustrate these choices. Figure 17.2, pages 351&ndash;52, shows a filmstrip and
sound recording set in which the sound recording is considered predominant be-
cause it is intended to be played with or without the filmstrip, which only has pic-
tures that add minimally to the enjoyment of the music. This item is cataloged as
a sound recording with an accompanying filmstrip.
</p>
<p>Figure 17.3, pages 353&ndash;54, shows a sound cassette, response sheets, a post
test, and a teacher&rsquo;s guide set. None of the parts conveys the whole content.
There are references in the sound cassette to the response sheet and vice versa;
the post test needs both to be understood; and the teacher&rsquo;s guide contains more
information on the topic. This set is cataloged as a kit.
</p>
<p>For practical reasons, Library of Congress catalogers follow a policy that
directs them to select one piece of a multipiece item as predominant and catalog
the other pieces as accompanying material; but others can decide what an item is
according to AACR2-98&rsquo;s definitions.
</p>
<p>Games (including handheld games with computer chips), puzzles, and di-
oramas are exceptions to the definition of kits. Although usually comprising
many pieces in different media, they are considered single units for cataloging
purposes and follow Chapter 10&rsquo;s rules. However, an item in several media that
is not designed to be manipulated according to a set of rules is not a game and
must be judged by the other possibilities outlined previously.
</p>
<p>AACR2-98 operates on the assumption that, when in doubt, the cataloger&rsquo;s
judgment is the ultimate authority. For that reason, do not be afraid to exercise it.
Catalogers have more training and experience in making these judgments than
anyone else in the library. It is better to make a judgment promptly that one de-
cides, later, was not correct than to hold an item indefinitely until one gets help
with it. A catalog record can be changed to reflect the change of mind, but patrons
will have been able to use the material in the meantime.

</p>
<p>The ISBD structure for description, which is the generally accepted inter-
national standard mandated by the IFLA, has eight elements called areas of
description:
</p>
<p>Area 1: Title and statement of responsibility
</p>
<p>Area 2: Edition
</p>
<p>Area 3: Material specific details
</p>
<p>Area 4: Publication, distribution, etc.
</p>
<p>Area 5: Physical description
</p>
<p>Area 6: Series
</p>
<p>Area 7: Notes
</p>
<p>Area 8: Standard number and terms of availability
</p>
<p>All areas of description do not apply to every item cataloged; for example,
many items do not have information about the edition and, where it does not ap-
pear, edition information is left out of the description. This also is true of series
information and notes, most of which are optional. Material specific details are
used for only a few of the formats: serials in any physical form, electronic re-
sources, maps, and music. Not all materials have standard numbers.
</p>
<p>Descriptive cataloging is like a puzzle with eight blank spaces, some or all
of which are filled in according to the information appearing on the item being
cataloged. There may be more information than needed or several competing
sources of information on an item. Rules in AACR2-98 help different catalogers
choose the same sources of information for cataloging purposes, if more than
one source is likely to be present. These rules are numbered with a zero (.0) be-
cause they precede determining any of the areas of description, which are num-
bered one through eight (.1 - .8). Rule 5.0B covers information sources for
music, rule 9.0B covers information sources for electronic resources, and so
forth.
</p>
<p>At the start of each chapter, all the sources for cataloging information for
that format are discussed. One is designated the chief source for that format; the
rest are considered prescribed sources. Area 1 data must come from the chief
source. It is the most important piece of information, and people using the cata-
log record should be able to assume it came from the chief source. If, for some
reason, it does not&mdash;for example, because there is no information at all on the
item, which is the case with realia (see Figure 17.4, page 356)&mdash;catalogers alert
the user to that fact by putting the information supplied from elsewhere into
square brackets and listing the source of the information in the notes (area 7).
This note is especially important for serials. The first issue is designated as chief
source, but if it is unavailable and another issue (the earliest available) is used in-
stead, that must be noted.
</p>
<p>Descriptive Structure and Sources 355</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Each area of description has specific sources prescribed for it. Only area 1
is limited to the chief source. Data for all the other areas may come from any of
several sources listed. Areas 5, 7, and 8 may come from any source, including
personal knowledge. When information is taken from sources outside those pre-
scribed, square brackets are put around it to identify it. When appropriate, notes
explain the sources of bracketed data.
</p>
<p>The general principle followed by AACR2-98 about information sources is
to prefer information from the item itself over information from other locations.
If a chapter covers a format that requires hardware to see or view the item itself,
alternatives are provided for catalogers who have no equipment. Some formats
have multipart chief sources, such as a videorecording with opening and closing
credits screens or a set of sound discs with labels pasted permanently on each
disc. Practical guidelines for choosing among them are given. If an alternative to
the preferred chief source for the format is chosen, it becomes chief source, and
information from it does not have to be bracketed, but it should be explained in a
note.

<p>IFLA&rsquo;s experts devised a system of punctuation that distinguishes each part
of a catalog record and helps a cataloger unfamiliar with the language of a record
to understand and use it. Unfortunately, when punctuation rules are read together
at the beginning of each section, they seem terribly complicated. It is easier to put
in the punctuation after the descriptive elements are assembled. Practice also
helps do this mechanical part of preparing catalog records faster. Figure 17.5, be-
low and page 358, illustrates the punctuation for a typical Level 2 description. It
can be imitated provided all the same data elements are present, but if any ele-
ment or subelement is missing, the punctuation changes. Basic punctuations
used are described below. Others may be found in AACR2-98, which gives all
the correct marks.

<p>Unless an area of description begins a paragraph, it is preceded by a period-
space-dash-space (. &mdash; ). In North America, it is customary to combine areas 1&ndash;4
in one paragraph, areas 5 and 6 in a second, and each note in its own paragraph.
Area 8 also is given a separate paragraph. In some countries, all elements of de-
scription appear in one paragraph, so it is useful to have the period-space-dash-space
define them.
</p>
<p>Colons (:), semicolons (;), slashes (/), and commas (,) are used for several
kinds of identification, an equals sign (=) denotes the same data in another lan-
guage, and a plus sign (+) identifies accompanying materials (area 5). In area 1,
colons separate title proper from the rest of the title; in area 4, they separate the
place of publication from the name of the publisher; and in area 5, they separate
the extent from other physical details. Slashes identify statements of responsibil-
ity in areas 1, 2, 6, and 7. Within statements of responsibility, semicolons sepa-
rate names when responsibilities differ, but commas are used when the
responsibilities are the same, but are shared by more than one person. Examples
follow:
</p>
<p>1. A book written by one person, illustrated by another, and edited by a
third party:
</p>
<p>/ by Sheila S. Intner ; illustrated by Jean Weihs ; edited by John
Robert Jones.
</p>
<p>(All the words given above appear on the title page as shown.)
</p>
<p>2. A book written by all three:
</p>
<p>/ by Sheila S. Intner, Jean Weihs, John Robert Jones.
</p>
<p>(The word &ldquo;by&rdquo; appears on the title page, with the names listed under-
neath.)
</p>
<p>3. A book written by two people and edited by a third:
</p>
<p>/ by Sheila S. Intner, Jean Weihs ; [edited by] John Robert Jones.
</p>
<p>(The words &ldquo;edited by&rdquo; do not appear on the title page and are sup-
plied by the cataloger to explain Jones&rsquo;s contribution to the book.)
</p>
<p>Whenever colons, semicolons, and slashes are used in ISBD punctuation, a
space is put both before and after the mark. Commas and periods (called &ldquo;full
stops&rdquo;) only have spaces after the mark, none before it. Catalogers need not
worry much about punctuation errors, since most patrons do not notice them and
they rarely affect retrieval.
</p>
<p>ISBD punctuation marks precede the elements they identify just as state-
ments in a computer program tell the computer what kind of data it is going to
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>receive before sending it (for example, many OPACs instruct searchers to enter
statements such as &ldquo;title=hamlet&rdquo; or &ldquo;au=shakespeare&rdquo;). When a descriptive ele-
ment or subelement is missing, the punctuation that precedes it is omitted, not the
punctuation that follows it.

<p>Area 1&mdash;Title and Statement of Responsibility
</p>
<p>The first information in any description is the main title, called title proper.
It is chosen from the chief source and transcribed exactly as it appears on the
item as to the order and spelling of the words, even if they are wrong. The reason-
ing behind precise transcription is to ensure that a catalog record can be matched
to the item it represents, especially when several versions of a title or similar-
sounding titles exist.
</p>
<p>The layout and typography of the words on the chief source of information
are used to determine where a title proper begins and ends. AACR2-98&rsquo;s rules
aid in determining titles proper in some special cases that are encountered fre-
quently; for example, if two separate versions of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s voyage ap-
pear in the two ways shown in Figures 17.6 and 17.7, pages 360&ndash;63, rules in
Chapter 1 direct the cataloger to transcribe them as given. When there is no rule
to determine what should be done, follow your instincts and decide.

<p>Capitalization and punctuation of the title proper are not transcribed exactly
as they appear on the chief source. Capitalization of all parts of the descrip-
tion follows standard rules contained in AACR2-98&rsquo;s Appendix A. In English-
language titles, usually only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized.
Different rules govern capitalization for other languages. Punctuation is not
transcribed as it appears, particularly when it might be confused with ISBD
punctuation.
</p>
<p>Sometimes an item is published in two (or more) languages and has titles in
both of them. Both are considered part of the title proper. A bilingual title does
not always mean the material is a bilingual work. In Figure 17.8, page 364, de-
spite the presence of a bilingual title on the title page, the book is not written in
two languages. ( ) is pronounced &ldquo;Nunavut&rdquo; and translates as
&ldquo;Our land.&rdquo;) Most cataloging departments do not have the syllabic typeface to
list the Inuktitut title as required for second level cataloging, so first level en-
riched cataloging&mdash;defined as more data than required by Level 1, but not as
much as required by Level 2&mdash;may be a simple, practical solution for titles with
nonroman alphabets.

<p>After the title proper, the rules suggest that a general material designation
be given, to alert the catalog user to the item&rsquo;s physical format. AACR2-98 has
two lists of permissible general material designations (gmds), one for use by
British catalogers, one for catalogers in Australia, Canada, and the United States.
</p>
<p>Gmds are optional. In libraries consisting mostly of books, the gmd for
books, text, usually is omitted and only gmds for other formats are used. If books
are not the library&rsquo;s primary material, the cataloger may decide to use text along
with all the others. If using gmds, put them immediately after the title proper, ex-
cept for uniform titles.
</p>
<p>Following the gmd (or title proper if gmd is not used) the rest of the title ap-
pears, called other title information by AACR2-98. (This part of area 1 is not re-
quired for Level 1 descriptions.) Figure 17.9, below and page 366, presents an
example of other title information.

<p>Very long other title information can be given in the notes (as shown in
Figure 17.28 on pages 402&ndash;3), where LC has chosen to do this in its CIP record.
The Library of Congress also opts to omit other title information for serials.
</p>
<p>The last part of area 1 is the statement of responsibility. Here, the name(s)
of the author(s), composer(s), artist(s), programmer(s), or other people or groups
responsible for the overall content of the item are given, provided they appear
&ldquo;prominently&rdquo; on the item being cataloged. Some catalogers interpret promi-
nence as just appearing on the chief source or outer covering, but others choose
to include only the names that appear in large print, or that are identified as being
important contributors to the work. Some never give the names of writers of
forewords, no matter how they are displayed. If no names appear on the item, this
element is omitted.
</p>
<p>Names that are important to the library but are not prominently displayed
on the item being cataloged can be given in area 7 (the note area) to form the ba-
sis for headings. Any name used as an access point must be given somewhere in
the catalog record. If the name has not appeared in areas 1 through 6, a note pro-
vides the basis for the access point. Some computerized catalogs have the capac-
ity to search all fields of the record, so putting a name in the note field provides
access without having to make a separate access point. For example, in Figure
17.9, A. J. Casson, an important Canadian painter, is the book&rsquo;s designer.
Usually book designers are not given in the catalog record, but an art school
might want to provide access to all Casson&rsquo;s work in its collection.
</p>
<p>If more than one name is given for the same kind of contribution to the cre-
ation of the work&mdash;for example, joint authors or joint producers&mdash;they are sepa-
rated by commas. If more than one name is given but each is for a different
contribution to the creation of the work&mdash;for example, an author and an illustra-
tor or a producer and a director&mdash;they are separated by different punctuation to
indicate that they did not have the same kind of responsibility. (Level 1 descrip-
tions give only the first statement of responsibility if it differs from the item&rsquo;s
main heading, or if there is no personal name main entry heading.)
</p>
<p>Area 2&mdash;Edition
</p>
<p>If an edition is named on the prescribed sources of information for this area,
it is transcribed as it appears in the second area of description. It should be abbre-
viated if abbreviations for one or more of the words being transcribed are listed
in AACR2-98&rsquo;s Appendix B or C. Figure 17.10, page 368, uses many abbrevia-
tions, but transcribes the words in the order in which they appear.

<p>Area 3&mdash;Material Specific Details
</p>
<p>Four kinds of materials require use of area 3: cartographic materials,
printed music, electronic resources, and serials in all formats. Each type of mate-
rial has its own information for this area, hence the name material specific. For
cartographic items, the scale and, when found on the item, the projection and, op-
tionally, a statement of coordinates and equinox are given; for music, the musical
presentation; for electronic resources, when such information is readily avail-
able, the type of file and information relating to the number and size of files; and
for serials, the numbering of the first volume. Serials in one of the nonbook for-
mats also requiring area 3 may have two different types of data for this area.
</p>
<p>Serials employ area 3 to record numbering and dating of issues. These data
are followed by a hyphen and spaces to indicate that the area is unfinished. If the

</p>
<p>The first issue of a magazine says &ldquo;Issue number 1&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Area 3: Issue no. 1- .
</p>
<p>The last issue of the same magazine says &ldquo;Issue number 101&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Area 3: Issue no. 1-101.
</p>
<p>The first screen of an electronic periodical says &ldquo;Volume 1, number 1,
1999&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Area 3: Vol. 1, no. 1 (1999)- .
</p>
<p>The first screen of an electronic periodical says &ldquo;Volume 1, number 1,
January 1999&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Area 3: Vol. 1, no. 1 (Jan. 1999)- .
</p>
<p>The rules assume the original numbering style will not change over the life
of a serial, but occasionally it does. Sometimes a publisher begins by numbering
issues sequentially, but finds, later on, that it wants to supply volume and issue
numbers. This happened with Library Hi-Tech, which displays both its old and
new numbering systems (see Figure 17.11, page 370).
</p>
<p>Figures 17.12 through 17.14 (pages 371&ndash;74) illustrate area 3 for nonbook
materials that require it. (Area 3 is required for Level 1 cataloging, but not every
subelement must be included.)
</p>
<p>Area 4&mdash;Publication, Distribution, Etc.
</p>
<p>Area 4 gives the locations and names of publishers or distributors of pub-
lished items being cataloged and the dates they were issued. (For cataloging pur-
poses, all remote access electronic resources, which includes all those on the
Internet, are considered published.)
</p>
<p>For serial items, the date on the issue used as the basis of cataloging is
given, but it is left open by adding a hyphen and spaces following the date. For
unpublished materials, locations and names are omitted; but, based on the ratio-
nale that dates are too important to omit, the date of an item&rsquo;s creation is given in
this area. Naturally occurring objects that have not been packaged for commer-
cial distribution are the only exception; no date is given for them (see Figure
17.4). (Level 1 records require only the first publisher&rsquo;s name and the date, and
also leave the date open for serials.)

<p>Catalogers should not equate production of nonbook items with publica-

included in this area&mdash;must always be given, even if the item bears no dates of
any kind. There is only one exception to this rule&mdash;dates are not given to natu-
rally occurring objects (see figure 17.4). Various kinds of dates are found on ma-
terials, including publication (or distribution) dates, copyright dates, printing
dates, production dates, manufacture dates, and so forth. The preferred date for
area 4 is publication or distribution, not copyright, printing, production, or man-
ufacture. If there are several dates, all publication or distribution dates, choose
the one that matches the edition statement in area 2. If there still is a choice
among publication or distribution dates applying to that edition, choose the latest
date.
</p>
<p>When there is no publication or distribution date given on the item, the next
best choice for area 4 is the copyright date. Nonbook materials may be copy-
righted long before they are released, so some care should be exercised in select-
ing old copyright dates for new distributions, e.g., a 1990s video production of a
1940s film. It is better to make an educated guess than to use a copyright date
from the 1940s for a video that could not possibly have been made and distrib-
uted during that decade. The guessed date may be given in one of the following
ways, depending on the degree of certainty that it is correct:
</p>
<p>[1999]&mdash;the year is not in doubt, but the source is not one of those
prescribed
</p>
<p>[1999?]&mdash;the year is in doubt; the cataloger guesses it is 1999
</p>
<p>[199-]&mdash;the exact year is in doubt, but the cataloger knows it is in the 1990s
</p>
<p>[199-?]&mdash;the exact year is in doubt; the cataloger guesses it is in the 1990s,
but is not certain of it
</p>
<p>A copyright date is identified by preceding it with a &ldquo;c&rdquo; or, in the case of
some recordings, a &ldquo;p&rdquo; (&ldquo;phonogram&rdquo;). If copyright and publication dates differ,
both may be given in this area, publication date first, or, the copyright date may
be given in a note.
</p>
<p>In the absence of either a publication/distribution date or a copyright date,
the date of manufacture may be given in area 4, but it must be identified as such.
When no dates appear on the item, the cataloger must guess, based on whatever
information is available. The cataloger may look up the item in a reference work,
consider the technology, or glean clues from the item itself. As shown above,
AACR2-98 suggests many ways to express an approximate date, depending on
the cataloger&rsquo;s degree of certainty and the time span.6
</p>
<p>Figure 17.16, pages 378&ndash;79, illustrates how research and common sense
help approximate a date of publication. The preface is dated 1932 and the book&rsquo;s
verso says it is a wartime book. To what war does it refer? World War II is a logi-
cal assumption. Reference sources reveal that C.H. Best, a well-known scientist
who helped discover insulin, was active then. The book was printed in the United
States, which entered the war in 1941, making 1942&ndash;1945 the likely range of
years in which it was published.

<p>Area 5&mdash;Physical Description
</p>
<p>Physical description includes the number and kind of pieces, called the ex-
tent of item, which includes the specific material designation (smd) and, for some
media, duration; other physical details; dimensions; and accompanying materi-
als, if any. (Only extent is required for Level 1 records.) Extent, physical details,
and dimensions vary by medium, but accompanying materials&mdash;added pieces
physically separate from the item being cataloged&mdash;are treated the same way for
all materials.
</p>
<p>For books, extent is given as the number of pages, leaves (pages with text
on only one side), or volumes. A special case is books issued with loose-leaf
pages. For them, only the number of volumes is given, with the word
&ldquo;loose-leaf&rdquo; following in parentheses. Plates in a book are another special case.
By definition, plates are separate pages bound in with a text after it is prepared.
They are considered a separate part of the extent and are counted and listed after
the regular pagination.
</p>
<p>Electronic resources, sound recordings, and videos are described in terms
of the number of discs, cartridges, cassettes, reels, or other carrier types. Motion
pictures usually are described in terms of the number of reels, although carriers
other than reels may be encountered. Microforms, like motion pictures, may
be described as reels of film, but they also can be fiches, opaques, and so forth. It
is not always possible to anticipate development of media formats, so rules in
AACR2-98 Chapters 7 through 10 allow catalogers to create an appropriate smd
for an item.
</p>
<p>The abbreviation &ldquo;ill.&rdquo; is given for illustrations in printed materials and
their reproductions, for example, microforms. Tables, illustrated title pages, and
minor illustrations are not considered &ldquo;ill.&rdquo; Optionally, specific types of illustra-
tions may be given.7 This option has been adopted for demonstration purposes in
the figures and examples in this book.

<p>Area 6&mdash;Series
</p>
<p>If an item belongs to a series, the name of the series is given in this area.
(Level 1 records omit this area entirely.) The main title of a series is transcribed
exactly as it appears on the item, even if the cataloger wishes to make a heading
for it that is slightly different. When they are important for identification, state-
ments of responsibility associated with a series may be given, also. If an ISSN
has been assigned to the series or a number within the series has been given to the
item, these are included. Some items regularly bear both ISBNs and ISSNs, so
catalogers can treat them either serially or monographically (see Figure 17.18),
below and pages 382&ndash;83).

<p>Area 7&mdash;Notes
</p>
<p>With some exceptions, notes are optional at all bibliographic levels; how-
ever, in rules for other areas of description catalogers are directed to make spe-
cific notes, for example, noting the source of title proper if it does not come from
the chief source. &ldquo;Title supplied by cataloger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Title from cover&rdquo; are seen in
catalog records explaining bracketed titles proper. For electronic resources,
notes explaining the source of title proper and of an edition statement if different
from the source of title proper, as well as the systems requirements, are mandated
at all levels.
</p>
<p>AACR2-98 prescribes the order in which notes should appear. They follow
the order of descriptive elements, with notes relating to titles given before notes
relating to editions, notes relating to editions before notes relating to publication,
distribution, and so forth. AACR2-98 allows an important note to be put first.
Such a decision is made on a medium-by-medium basis; for example, the pub-
lisher&rsquo;s or producer&rsquo;s number is given first for all sound recordings. Changes
must be approved by the appropriate national bodies before becoming part of
standard practice for that nation. Other nations may choose not to follow suit.
</p>
<p>Optional notes that are important to make include the following:
</p>
<p>1. Physical description: For videorecordings and electronic resources,
this is the only place to include information about needed hardware. Books and
other formats also benefit; for example, in Figure 17.19, pages 384&ndash;85, it
informs users the book is chiefly photographs.

<p>2. System requirements: Figure 17.20 shows two different kinds of notes
for electronic resources. These notes are mandatory. Electronic resources physi-
cally held in a library are given a systems requirements note. Electronic re-
sources accessed from remote sources need a note to describe how to gain
access, called a &ldquo;mode of access&rdquo; note, which should include the electronic ad-
dress or Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The date the item was viewed for
cataloging purposes should be added to the record as the final note.

<p>3. Contents notes: These should be made when an item contains more
than one work, such as a CD-ROM containing two or more titles (see Figure
17.21, below and page 387). Limits on the number of titles to include in a con-
tents note are hard to set. Between the extremes of very few and too many, cata-
logers must use judgment. The decision should rest on an estimate of how often
people want only one work and whether they can find it another way. This also
facilitates making added entries for each work, which cannot be done unless
their titles appear somewhere in the catalog record.

<p>The experience of LC&rsquo;s and NLC&rsquo;s catalogers in applying the rules can be
helpful for others, if they wish to adopt them. The Library of Congress&rsquo;s official
policies are available in its Cataloging Service bulletin, an inexpensive periodi-
cal, and NLC&rsquo;s are available via the Internet.9 The LC and NLC rule interpreta-
tions (LCRIs and NLCRIs) are not as authoritative as rules of AACR2-98, but
they carry the weight of the largest and most important originators of catalog re-
cords in the United States and Canada, respectively, and the major computerized
bibliographic networks follow them.
</p>
<p>�������(&amp;��

</p>
<p>The next step in the cataloging process is creating headings for the descrip-
tion. Rules for headings appear in part 2 of AACR2-98. Chapter 21 covers
choosing which elements from the description should be selected as headings.
When searched in the catalog, the selected names, titles, or combinations of
names and titles will result in retrieving the record.
</p>
<p>All but one of AACR2-98&rsquo;s remaining chapters have rules for putting the
chosen headings into the proper form. They explain how to construct headings
for personal names (Chapter 22); geographic names (Chapter 23); names for en-
tities made up of groups of people acting together, known as corporate bodies
(Chapter 24); and conventional titles assigned to works that may appear with
varying titles even though the work is the same, called uniform titles (Chapter
25). (Dates and control numbers are not mentioned, because searching under
numeric elements is a feature of computerized systems, not a result of applying
the rules.)
</p>
<p>Chapter 26 describes references made to assist catalog users&mdash;see, see also,
name-title, and explanatory references&mdash;and how to make them for names of
persons, places, corporate bodies, and uniform titles. The chapter also discusses
</p>
<p>ACCESS POINTS&mdash;RETRIEVING THE RECORD 391</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>references to added entries for series and serials, and the use of references in
place of added entries.
</p>
<p>Headings are divided into two kinds: main and added entries. The only dif-
ference between them is that the first and most important heading chosen is des-
ignated the main entry; all the others are added entries. Main and added entries
are distinguished for several reasons. In catalogs providing only one heading per
item represented, main entry usually is the one chosen. The most important rea-
son today for retaining the main entry concept is that shelf marks, additions to the
classification number that form shelf addresses, are derived from the main entry.
Without main entries, rules for creating shelf marks would be needed.
</p>
<p>The Anglo-American cataloging tradition assumes a work&rsquo;s creator is its
primary identifying feature. Therefore, AACR2-98 usually, although not al-
ways, assigns main entry to the creator of a work. Two other possibilities for
main entry are a corporate body creator or a title. Only a single person, corporate
body, or title can be the main entry. There are no &ldquo;joint&rdquo; main entries, even if an
item being cataloged has two co-equal authors.
</p>
<p>When one person is responsible for the content of an item, he or she usually
is chosen as main entry, although there are exceptions. If the item comes from a
corporate body (called emanating by AACR2-98), the person might not be cho-
sen as main entry, although he or she would be named as an added entry. Figure
17.24, pages 393&ndash;94, shows a work of this type, for which a title main entry is se-
lected. Another exception applies to compiled or edited works, in which the true
creators are the authors of the various pieces, such as The Ark in the Garden, col-
lected by Albert Manguel (Figure 17.25, pages 395&ndash;96). Editors and compilers
are not considered creators, and AACR2-98 avoids selecting either of them for
main entry.
</p>
<p>Special rules about items created by more than one person or corporate
body, where all share the same creative function, such as writing a book or com-
posing a musical piece, are called rules for shared responsibility in AACR2-98.
If one person or body is determined as having most responsibility, catalogers
choose that one as main entry. If not, the one named first on the chief source of
information is chosen, unless more than three are listed.
</p>
<p>The chief way to decide whether one person has the most responsibility is
to look at the wording of the statement of responsibility. If the chief source says,
&ldquo;Programmed by Bill Atkinson, with the assistance of members of the
Macintosh staff,&rdquo; the cataloger can conclude that the contribution by the
Macintosh staff is less important than Atkinson&rsquo;s. The predominant person&rsquo;s
name can be given in larger type than the others (see Figure 17.20), set apart
from other names, or appear out of alphabetical order. These devices indicate
predominance among a group of creators. If no such devices are present, then all
parties probably are equally responsible.
</p>
<p>If there are two or three co-equal creators, main entry is assigned to the first
named. If there are four or more, the title is selected instead. This Rule of Three (a
library-wide rule of thumb) assumes people will not know any one creator when
a work has many co-creators; thus the title is a better choice.

<p>More special rules, called rules for mixed responsibility, explain how to
choose when people or bodies perform different creative functions for an item
being cataloged, such as drawing and coloring a cartoon. The rules lean toward
writers of text over illustrators, composers of music over arrangers or librettists,
and artists over other contributors when works of art are considered. Some items,
such as films and videos, usually are the product of many different kinds of cre-
ative effort&mdash;producing, directing, acting, costuming, music, and so forth&mdash;not
three or fewer. In these cases, none is chosen and the item receives a title main
entry.
</p>
<p>If an item emanates from a corporate body or a corporate body is named
&ldquo;author&rdquo; on the chief source of information, that corporate body is not automati-
cally named main entry. Rule 21.1B2 limits the use of a corporate body as main
entry to six specific instances:
</p>
<p>1. When the item is an internal document of the corporate body, such as
the catalog of one&rsquo;s library or information center, or the membership
directory of an association.
</p>
<p>2. When the item is an administrative document, such as the budget of
the organization or an annual report. Even though these documents
are prepared for external distribution, they are, nonetheless, a reflec-
tion of the body itself.
</p>
<p>3. When the item represents the collective thought of the body, such as
the minutes of a meeting or reports of a committee. Figure 17.26,
pages 398&ndash;99, illustrates such a report.
</p>
<p>4. When the item represents the collective effort of a voyage, expedi-
tion, or a conference meeting the definition of a corporate body, and
the event is named in the item. If, however, the event has no official
name, it does not meet the full definition of a corporate body, which is
&ldquo;an organization or a group of persons that is identified by a particular
name and that acts, or may act, as an entity.&rdquo;10 Figures 17.27 and
17.28, pages 400&ndash;404, show examples of named and unnamed con-
ferences (more likely to be encountered these days than voyages or
expeditions).
</p>
<p>5. If the item is a sound recording, film, or video, and the responsible
corporate body does more than just perform it. This involves judging
when a performing group does something that qualifies as more than
mere performance, i.e., something we would call creation. The cata-
loger asks to what extent new notes, words, or movements are being
created, typical of improvisation. In classical music, improvisation is
unusual; in popular or jazz music, the opposite is true. Thus, popular
performing groups often earn main entries. This also is true of some
videos and films. The rule is applicable to performers who act to-
gether as a group and have a name, such as the rock group Kiss. It
would not apply to individuals who happened to be on the same pro-
gram for a recording date or a concert.
</p>
<p>ACCESS POINTS&mdash;RETRIEVING THE RECORD 397</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6. When the item is a cartographic representation and the corporate
body is responsible for more than publication. An example is the Na-
tional Geographic Society, which may finance expeditions to explore
the territories it maps, hire and direct staff who do the cartographic
work, and perform other functions as well.
</p>
<p>When an item emanates from a corporate body but does not fit into these
categories, it is not given a corporate body main entry. The emanation is ex-
cluded and either a creator or a title would be selected as main entry. According
to AACR2-98, the cataloger should name as main entry &ldquo;the personal author, the
principal personal author, or the probable personal author.&rdquo;11

<p>The third option, title main entry, is applied when there is no known cre-
ator; when there are more than three creators sharing equal amounts of the same
responsibility for the item, if their contributions are the same (see Figure 17.29,
pages 405&ndash;6); when the item emanates from a corporate body but is not eligible
for corporate body main entry and has no personal author (see Figure 17.30,
pages 407&ndash;8); or when the work is produced under editorial direction (see Figure
17.24).

<p>The following questions and caveats form a useful decision-tree for deter-
mining main entry:
</p>
<p>1. Does the item emanate from a corporate body? No? Proceed to ques-
tion 8. Yes? Go to question 2. (If in doubt, assume the answer is no
and proceed to question 8.)
</p>
<p>2. Is the item an administrative work dealing with the body itself? Yes?
Assign a corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate body
is involved, follow the rules for multiple personal authors, below.)
No? Go to question 3.
</p>
<p>3. Is the item one of the designated types of works in rule 21.1B2b?
Yes? Assign a corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate
body is involved, follow the rules for multiple personal authors,
below.) No? Go to question 4.
</p>
<p>4. Does the item record the collective thought of the body? Yes? Assign
a corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is in-
volved, follow the rules for multiple personal authors, below.) No?
Go to question 5.
</p>
<p>5. Does the item record the collective activity of an event? Yes? Assign
a corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is in-
volved, follow the rules for multiple personal authors, below.) No?
Go to question 6.
</p>
<p>6. Does the item result from the collective activity of a performing
group as a whole that goes beyond mere performance? Yes? Assign a
corporate body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is in-
volved in the performing group, follow the rules for multiple personal
authors, below.) No? Go to question 7.
</p>
<p>7. Is the item cartographic, and does the responsibility of the corporate
body go beyond publication/distribution? Yes? Assign a corporate
body main entry. (If more than one corporate body is involved, follow
the rules for multiple personal authors, below.) No? Go to question 8.
</p>
<p>8. Is the work by one or more persons? No? Assign a title main entry.
Yes? Go to question 9.
</p>
<p>9. Is one person the sole creator or principal creator of the work? Yes?
Assign that person as main entry. No? Go to question 10.
</p>
<p>10. Are two or three persons equally responsible for the creation of the
work? Yes? Assign the first-named as main entry and give added en-
tries for the rest. No? Go to question 11.
</p>
<p>11. Are more than three persons responsible for the creation of the work?
Assign a title main entry.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CAVEAT #1: Questions 10 and 11 assume shared responsibility. Consult
the special rules for mixed responsibility when there are different
types of contributions. Apply the Rule of Three both to the types of
contributions and number of persons or bodies sharing a single type. If
either of those elements exceeds three and none are predominant, as-
sign title main entry.
</p>
<p>CAVEAT #2: Editors are not creators of the works they edit. An edited
work having contributions by one or more authors is considered the
collective work of those authors, whether persons, corporate bodies,
or both. BUT, bibliography compilers are creators, even if the term
applied to the compiler on the title page is &ldquo;editor.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Once main entry is chosen, it is time to consider choosing other access
points, called added entries. Some added entries are mandated by the rules for
main entry. A rule will say, &ldquo;Choose A as the main entry and make an added
entry for B.&rdquo; Any added entries may be made if a cataloger thinks they are
needed by users of the catalog, so long as they are mentioned in the bibliographic
description. Notes are made about variant titles, titles of parts, or secondary
statements of responsibility, in order that they may be selected as headings. This
is not true of main entries. A name or title may be chosen main entry of an item
even if it never appears in the bibliographic description. Uniform titles are con-
structed by catalogers and cannot be transcribed. When an item is erroneously at-
tributed on the chief source, but the cataloger knows who truly created it, the
rules prescribe giving the main entry to its true creator (or its probable creator, if
there is doubt).
</p>
<p>Added entries made routinely include joint creators; people or bodies mak-
ing other creative contributions if they are named prominently on the item and do
more than distribute it; titles proper or uniform titles not chosen as main entry;
title variations found on the item; analytical titles; and series titles. A new type of
added entry is an electronic resource&rsquo;s URL. Many guidelines for cataloging
Internet resources recommend making it, preferably as a direct link.

</p>
<p>Once headings are chosen, AACR2-98 provides numerous rules for putting
them into authorized form (called &ldquo;establishing&rdquo; them) for use in the catalog.
</p>
<p>Personal Names
</p>
<p>Two principles underlie the rules in AACR2-98 for the form into which a
personal name heading is put: The heading form should be the one most familiar
to searchers, and in most instances, only one heading should be used for a single
individual, ensuring that all his or her works are collocated in the catalog.
</p>
<p>The first principle seems logical, but is the reverse of the AACR1 principle.
AACR1 required that catalogers determine and use the fullest form of a person&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>410 17&mdash;Description and Access</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>real name. AACR2-98 follows Charles Cutter&rsquo;s idea that catalog headings
should match what searchers expect to find. It instructs catalogers to use the most
commonly known name form and sometimes permits more than one to be used
simultaneously. AACR2-98 also permits pseudonyms, initials, and appellations
to be used as headings if they are how an individual is most commonly known.
</p>
<p>To determine the most common form of name, catalogers count the number
of times each form appears on published works and use the one that appears most
often. Some contemporary creators change the names on their works often. In
this case, AACR2-98 allows catalogers to use whatever form appears on the item
being cataloged, and suggests references to link the various forms. If a creator
has different name forms, cross-references should be made for forms that are not
used as well as multiple name forms that are used.
</p>
<p>Fortunately for catalogers, most creators do not use multiple name forms.
The form established when an individual&rsquo;s first work is cataloged often is the
only authoritative heading needed. National libraries prepare files of the name
forms they establish and catalogers can choose to adopt them. They do not al-
ways select the same form for a person (see the CIPs in Figure 17.28 for Jean
Weihs). LC and NLC have a formal policy for the establishment of the names of
corporate bodies, but this agreement does not cover personal names.12
</p>
<p>Corporate Bodies
</p>
<p>The same principles apply to corporate bodies. One heading generally is
used for a corporate body. When a corporate body changes its name, however, it
may also become a new body. Changes are more likely to be substantive, result-
ing in the presence of more than one heading for a corporate body that has
evolved over time.
</p>
<p>Using the most commonly known form of name as the authoritative form
holds for corporate bodies as well as for people&rsquo;s names, but the application dif-
fers. The name used by the group on its stationery, official documents, and publi-
cations is selected. Problems occur when a body updates its image by changing
its logo. Rules define substantive changes to a corporate body name to eliminate
multiple headings for a body undergoing a change of this kind. Sometimes cor-
porate bodies announce an intention to change names, e.g., Trenton State Col-
lege to College of New Jersey. Multiple names are appropriate in that case.
</p>
<p>If a corporate body is part of a larger body, catalogers must decide how to
formulate its name: alone (called &ldquo;direct&rdquo; entry) or as a unit under the larger body
(called &ldquo;subordinate&rdquo; entry). It is even more difficult when multiple layers of
bureaucracy separate the parent body and the subordinate unit; for example, the
Committee on Cataloging: Description and Access (CC:DA)&mdash;the committee
that governs AACR2-98 in the United States&mdash;has two intervening layers of
hierarchy between its parent entity, the American Library Association (ALA),
and the unit itself:
</p>
<p>Form of Headings&mdash;Name and Title Authorities 411</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1. American Library Association (parent body)
</p>
<p>2. Association for Library Collections and Technical Services
(sub-unit of the parent body, one of its divisions)
</p>
<p>3. Cataloging and Classification Section (sub-unit of the
division)
</p>
<p>4. Committee on Cataloging: Description and Access
(sub-unit of the section)
</p>
<p>When the name of a corporate body implies that it is a subordinate
unit&mdash;clearly the case with a &ldquo;committee,&rdquo; &ldquo;division,&rdquo; or &ldquo;section&rdquo;&mdash;the name
of the higher body is included. AACR2-98 instructs catalogers to include the
name of the lowest unit of hierarchy that can stand alone, provided it is a unique
identification. For CC:DA, the only higher body that needs to be added is Asso-
ciation for Library Collections and Technical Services (ALCTS). The authorita-
tive name form for CC:DA is, thus, Association for Library Collections and
Technical Services. Committee on Cataloging: Description and Access. &ldquo;Cata-
loging and Classification Section&rdquo; is not used, because it is subordinate and no
other section of ALCTS has a committee by this name.
</p>
<p>The Cataloging and Classification Section of ALCTS has a Policy and
Research Committee, but its authoritative heading would not be Association for
Library Collections and Technical Services. Policy and Research Committee,
because another section within ALCTS, the Serials Section, also has a commit-
tee by that name. Each one must be identified uniquely. The authoritative form of
the Cataloging and Classification Section&rsquo;s Policy and Research Committee is,
therefore, Association for Library Collections and Technical Services. Cata-
loging and Classification Section. Policy and Research Committee.
</p>
<p>For searchers, the best aid is making cross-references to any potential
search term and programming OPACs to match any combination of words in
corporate body headings and retrieve all sets that include the requested terms.
Thousands of corporate bodies are listed in LC&rsquo;s Name Authority File and
NLC&rsquo;s Canadiana Authorities, which can help catalogers.
</p>
<p>Geographic Names
</p>
<p>Geographic names also are used in headings for the catalog. One can imag-
ine the confusion that would result if different forms of name were used for the
same geographic entity. Should we use Britain, Great Britain, or United King-
dom as the authoritative heading for the territory inhabited by our colleagues
across the Atlantic? For places located in non-English-speaking countries, do we
use the English name form or the vernacular name form (e.g., Florence/Firenze)?
What about nonroman languages, such as Chinese or Russian?
</p>
<p>Chapter 23 instructs catalogers to use English forms for place names if
there are such forms in general use; if not, the vernacular form in the official lan-
guage of the country is preferred.13 When place names change, catalogers are
instructed to use as many names as are required by the rules in Chapter 24 for
</p>
<p>412 17&mdash;Description and Access</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>government names, additions to corporate and conference names, or other cor-
porate body name headings.
</p>
<p>Sometimes one name is used for more than one place (e.g., Cairo, Egypt
and Cairo, Illinois). Rules about additions serve to distinguish them. Additions
differ for various countries, with one group comprising Australia, Canada, Ma-
laysia, and the United States. Localities within these places are augmented by the
addition of the name of the state, province, territory, and so forth. The countries
of the British Isles&mdash;England, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scot-
land, and Wales as well as the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands&mdash;form a sec-
ond group, for which local place names are augmented by the addition of the
appropriate country or island name. This practice applies to other countries of
the world.
</p>
<p>Special rules cover places that require more specific identification or spe-
cial kinds of identification, for example, localities with identical headings even
after the appropriate additions are made (Saint Anthony, Hennepin County, Min-
nesota and Saint Anthony, Stearns County, Minnesota), communities within cities
(Hyde Park, London, England and Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois), or names of
political jurisdictions. These rules and their interpretations in LCRIs and
NLCRIs can be consulted if an item being cataloged requires establishing that
kind of heading. Place names are included in LC&rsquo;s and NLC&rsquo;s name authorities.
</p>
<p>Uniform Titles
</p>
<p>Most works appear in one edition with one title. The title proper transcrip-
tion is its title heading. A few works are issued many times over the years and the
same title proper is not always used, for example, The Holy Bible, The Douay
Bible, The Anchor Bible. Works appearing in different forms depending on the
issuer&rsquo;s whim are given a single title by catalogers called a uniform title, so they
all file together in the catalog. Uniform titles also are employed to distinguish
identical titles, such as musical works called &ldquo;Symphony,&rdquo; or serials called
&ldquo;Journal.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The most widely used uniform titles are found in AACR2-98&rsquo;s Chapter 25,
along with rules for creating and assigning uniform titles to works catalogers
think should have one. Uniform titles are common among six types of works:
classics, music, religious works, laws, works issued complete or in parts, and
works appearing in several physical formats. Translations also may call for uni-
form titles, if a library owns multiple versions.
</p>
<p>Uniform titles need not be made for every work that exists in multiple ver-
sions unless several are represented in the catalog or are likely to be added to it.
Some, however, such as the Bible, may require the addition of a uniform title to
meet the requirements of cataloging networks, even though a library owns only
one version.
</p>
<p>Records of established headings, cross-references, and sources of informa-
tion used to establish them are called authority files. Large libraries doing much
original cataloging often keep such files, but they are costly and time-consuming
to maintain. As mentioned previously, when faced with a new name, catalogers
can consult LC&rsquo;s Name Authority File or the NLC&rsquo;s Canadiana Authorities for
</p>

to customers of bibliographic networks, commercial cataloging services, on

</p>
<p>Completing the descriptive cataloging is half the cataloging process&mdash;the
half dealing with works as physical entities and identifying them in terms appro-
priate to the formats in which they are manifested. Next, the contents of the mate-
rials are considered. Contents are defined, identified, and represented in terms of
their subject matter in two ways: through the assignment of subject headings and
by means of classification.
</p>
<p>No single code of rules governs subject cataloging, the term for assigning
subject headings to an item, or classification, the term for assigning category
codes that form the basis for call numbers. Instead, the primary decisions cata-
logers make are to adopt one of several available standard tools for these pur-
poses and then to follow accepted practices in applying them.
</p>
<p>Subject cataloging and classification are very similar in that both processes
require as their first step determining the subject content of the works being cata-
loged. Once this determination is made, the subject content can be represented in
two ways: in words (subject headings) and in codes that stand for categories of
knowledge (classifications). These processes of representing subject content of
materials are sometimes referred to as providing intellectual access to materials.
General principles of subject analysis&mdash;both subject cataloging (assignment of
subject headings to materials being cataloged) and classification (assignment of
category codes)&mdash;are discussed in this chapter. Specific tools&mdash;subject lists and
classification systems&mdash;are discussed in Chapters 19 and 20.
</p>
<p>'�

��
</p>
<p>The first step in representing the content of materials being cataloged is de-
ciding what the subject matter is. However, putting the process by which one
makes such a decision into words is difficult. Each cataloger brings his or her
personal background, knowledge, and experience to the task of deciding what
</p>
<p>418
</p>
<p>��</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>something is about and whether the approach taken to the material also is rele-
vant. Depending on how much a cataloger knows about a subject area, he or she
might recognize different aspects of content in a particular item. This will affect
the determination of subject matter made for that item.
</p>
<p>Typically, catalogers glean clues directly from the items being cataloged
that reveal their contents, whether or not the catalogers have special knowledge
of those subject areas. Sometimes the cataloger must conduct sufficient research
into an unfamiliar subject area to be able to handle items on that subject, but in
most libraries and for most materials, catalogers are expected only to be gener-
ally conversant with subjects, not experts. Where can the subject clues be found?
</p>
<p>Four places are likely sources for clues to the contents of items being cata-
loged: (1) titles, including alternative titles and subtitles; (2) tables of contents
and their equivalents such as menus and site maps; (3) indexes; and (4) introduc-
tions and prefaces. Catalogers are not supposed to read every word of a book or
Web site or view every inch of a videotape to ascertain its subject. Instead, the
item should be read or viewed &ldquo;technically,&rdquo; which is to say, a few key sources
should be examined carefully and subject matter, scope, and coverage deter-
mined from them. Often, subtitles are more revealing of subject content than
titles proper; chapter or segment titles can suggest scope and coverage; and
introductions or prefaces can include the author&rsquo;s intended audience, important
inclusions or exclusions, and other subject-related information. Back of the book
indexes, Web site index terms, and similar devices also offer evidence of the
range of subtopics covered in an item. A quick scan of the rest of the item can
answer any questions that remain after the cataloger has concluded the technical
examination.
</p>
<p>Other places catalogers can find information about the content of an item
are in publishers&rsquo; or producers&rsquo; descriptions of the item and in published reviews
of the item. These can augment information gleaned from the item itself when
technical reading or viewing fails to reveal the subject matter clearly or com-
pletely. Information from book jackets and similar promotional blurbs on
nonbook material is unreliable and should be used with great caution. These
sales devices are designed well before an item is published or released and are
aimed at enticing buyers, not providing accurate and complete descriptions.
</p>
<p>An item&rsquo;s content also can be affected by the approach taken to the mate-
rial. An item that gives an overview of the whole field of chemistry and an item
that is solely a dictionary of terminology used in the field of chemistry both are
&ldquo;about&rdquo; chemistry, but the dictionary approach merits recognition. It is different
from an introductory overview of the subject. General coverage of the subject is
assumed when catalogers say a book is about chemistry or a video is about exer-
cise. If the approach is not general, catalogers usually identify it by specifying its
form. A chemistry dictionary is about chemistry, but its form is that of a dictio-
nary. An exercise video is about exercise, but its approach may be that of a lec-
ture on the subject (general coverage) or an activity session in which the viewer
is expected to participate (directed exercise itself), and the physical form of the
item is an audiovisual presentation recorded on videotape. Thus, catalogers
speak of subject and form, where form may be defined as a genre (dictionaries,
</p>
<p>Determining Subject Matter 419</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>biographies, bibliographies, essays, etc.), a medium, or a specific type of ap-
proach to the subject.
</p>
<p>Subject matter may be limited to one location or time period, and geograph-
ical and chronological specifications often are added to reflect those limitations.
If a Web site about divorce is limited to Canada, catalogers want to express that
explicitly, so that a searcher seeking information about divorce in Mexico or the
United States would not think the item answers their need. Both subject headings
and classification sources provide for geographic and chronological approaches
to subjects.

</p>
<p>Subject headings and classification categories share other features, among
them the way the headings or categories are formulated and displayed. The
source of the headings or categories may list all or most of the terms or numbers
that can be assigned, and be deemed &ldquo;enumerative.&rdquo; To make an assignment, the
cataloger browses the listings and selects the subject heading or classification
category that corresponds to the contents of the item being cataloged. The other
option is for the source to list only parts or building blocks, called facets, from
which complete subject headings and classification categories can be assembled
(or synthesized). This is called being &ldquo;faceted&rdquo; or &ldquo;synthetic.&rdquo; To make an as-
signment, the cataloger selects and combines the appropriate facets and synthe-
sizes the subject heading or classification category corresponding to the content
of the item being cataloged. Although it is possible to list all the combinations
that could be synthesized from the facets of a faceted classification and create an
enumeration, the number of combinations would be so large that such a project
would not be viable.
</p>
<p>Another way of looking at enumeration versus faceting is to ask whether a
subject source provides prebuilt combinations of complex headings or catego-
ries or expects catalogers (and searchers) to do the work of building them. When
the combinations are prebuilt or prepared in advance before use, the source is
called &ldquo;precoordinated&rdquo;; when they are not, the source is called &ldquo;postcoordi-
nated,&rdquo; because the work is done at the point of use. Enumerative sources are
precoordinated, and examples include all the subject heading lists and classifica-
tion schemes popular in the United States and Canada (described in Chapters 19
and 20). Faceted or synthetic sources are postcoordinated, and examples include
the keywords used in searching computer databases or the Internet. A keyword,
although it might be used as a subject by itself, is likely to be combined with
other keywords to represent complex subjects, thus behaving like a facet (or
part) of the whole.
</p>
<p>Searching a keyword such as &ldquo;food&rdquo; on a huge database such as the Internet
could retrieve tens of thousands of &ldquo;hits,&rdquo; but combining &ldquo;food&rdquo; and &ldquo;Boston&rdquo;
and &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; could whittle them down to a group of reviews for Boston&rsquo;s res-
taurants (where food is likely to be served and reviewed), if that was what was
wanted. Postcoordination permits the parts&mdash;location (Boston), the approach
(reviews), and the topic (food)&mdash;to be entered in any order to retrieve the items
that contain all three. A precoordinated subject source might have a subject
</p>
<p>420 18&mdash;Subject Analysis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>heading or classification category for reviews of food served in Boston, but the
parts would have to be combined and expressed only one way and no other, for
example, BOSTON&mdash;RESTAURANTS&mdash;REVIEWS or RESTAURANTS&mdash;BOSTON&mdash;
REVIEWS, or, perhaps, REVIEWS, RESTAURANT&mdash;BOSTON. The
precoordinated classification scheme could subordinate location and approach
under the topic, food, or it could subordinate reviews of food services under the
location, Boston, but it would not do both.
</p>
<p>To succeed in searching the precoordinated index or classification, the cat-
aloger needs to know what the source considers its principal focus or where the
topic is located. For example, the Dewey Decimal Classification appends an in-
dex it calls its &ldquo;Relative Index,&rdquo; in which subject terms such as &ldquo;computers,&rdquo;
&ldquo;water,&rdquo; or &ldquo;children,&rdquo; which, as part of different disciplines, would be classified
in very different locations are brought together for consultative purposes. In this
way, a classifier can easily see that children&rsquo;s diseases are classified with topics
in medicine, but children&rsquo;s educational programs such as kindergartens and
nursery schools are classified with topics in education.

</p>
<p>Words used to represent the subject of an item in the catalog can be taken
from different sources, depending on individual library policy. Standard terms
come from published lists accepted by the cataloging community for use as sub-
ject headings in the catalog, called subject authorities. Subject authorities are
much like the name authorities discussed in Chapter 17. Because the lists control
which words can and cannot be used as subject headings, they are called con-
trolled vocabularies. All catalogers do not use the same list.
</p>
<p>Catalogers also can use the terminology found in the items being cataloged
by compiling lists of terms from the important title words. (Articles and other
words that do not reflect subject matter are ignored.) The cataloger cannot con-
trol the words an author will choose; therefore, title words used as subject head-
ings are referred to as uncontrolled terms or uncontrolled vocabularies.
Computer-based catalogs frequently are programmed to search title words as
well as authorized subject headings. To maximize the possibility of finding de-
sired materials, both types of subject terms should be used.
</p>
<p>Subject cataloging is a type of indexing done by catalogers for the materials
they catalog. Specialists known as indexers sometimes do similar work on the
text of a single book, for which they prepare an extensive index that is part of that
book. Indexers also work on journal articles, for which they prepare ongoing
periodical indexes, such as the Readers&rsquo; Guide to Periodical Literature, and
similar reference tools. Periodical indexes are used by people searching for in-
formation in articles published in magazines and journals. Like library catalogs,
periodical indexes also list authors&rsquo; names and article titles. The same principles
apply to all types of indexing, including subject cataloging, and the same search
skills are needed to retrieve indexed material from catalogs and reference works.
The main difference among the types of indexing is the nature of the material
</p>
<p>Subject Authorities: Vocabularies for Subject Cataloging 421</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>being indexed and the depth of the indexing. Back of the book indexers work on
individual items and prepare very deep indexes consisting of hundreds of terms
for one item. Periodical indexers work on ongoing sets of articles appearing in
specific journals (or article equivalents, such as book chapters), and do broader
indexing, consisting of several terms per article. Subject catalogers work on the
items they catalog, generally monographs or whole title runs, and the indexing is
very broad, assigning a few terms to describe the contents of the item at a sum-
mary level.
</p>

�&amp;�
</p>
<p>Another type of subject authority is the source from which numbers for
classification are taken. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Li-
brary of Congress Classification (LCC), two popular classification systems, are
discussed in Chapter 20. Both of these consist mainly of lists of numbers, each
paired with a term for the subject matter the number represents. Other helpful in-
formation may be added to the list of numbers, such as introductions giving his-
tory and background of the system, instructions on how to assign the numbers,
and indexes (that is, lists of verbal terms) to the numbers. A library generally
chooses only one of the classifications to assign to its materials, although no rule
says more than one cannot be used simultaneously. In the United States and Can-
ada, the numbers form the basis of shelf addresses that group together materials
covering the same topics; in other parts of the world, classification is used to
organize bibliographies as well.
</p>
<p>Classifications, like subject vocabularies, may be precoordinated or
postcoordinated, enumerative or faceted/synthetic. In fact, elements of both
kinds of listings appear in DDC and LCC to different degrees. The latter is over-
whelmingly precoordinated, enumerating hundreds of thousands of numbers or
categories from which to choose the appropriate number for an item. Neverthe-
less, it also has tables listing specific aspects of topics to be added to the numbers
from the main list if the classifier wants that topic to be limited in one particular
aspect. In contrast, DDC has many fewer numbers in its enumeration and a great
many more tables listing aspects of topics as well as numerous instructions in
one part of the list to apply its subdivision to similar topical areas. Although the
lists of numbers are precoordinated and enumerated, the tables and instructions
add a limited amount of synthesis to the systems. Facets provide a way of econo-
mizing on the total number of classification numbers that must be listed in a
source. Over the years, DDC has grown from fewer than 50 pages to more than
3,000, and LCC now consists of more than forty volumes, so such economies are
valuable from a practical, as well as a theoretical, point of view.
</p>
<p>Fully faceted classifications are not used very much in North America, but
they have enjoyed greater popularity elsewhere in the world. Among the
better-known faceted classifications are the Colon Classification, the Universal
Decimal Classification, and the Bliss Classification. Colon Classification was
devised in the early part of the twentieth century by S. R. Ranganathan, an Indian
</p>
<p>422 18&mdash;Subject Analysis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>theorist, and was adopted by a number of Indian libraries, although their number
has dwindled in recent years. It divides the universe of knowledge into forty-one
main classes to which numbers for five types of facets are added to build the
complete number. Ranganathan called his five facet types Personality, Matter,
Energy, Space, and Time. A complex system of letters from multiple alphabets,
numbers, and symbols was used for the numbers. The Universal Decimal Classi-
fication, a transformation of DDC devised by Belgians Henri Otlet and Henri La
Fontaine, internationalized DDC by translating it into French. It was also in-
tended to be more accommodating to automatic manipulation. Universal Deci-
mal Classification, which uses Arabic numbers and a few symbols, was adopted
and updated in the latter part of the twentieth century by UNESCO and has been
used in Europe for organizing bibliographies. The Bliss Classification, devised
by Henry Evelyn Bliss, librarian at the City College of New York, was used for
many years in that library and a few libraries in England, but it did not develop
much more of a following. It uses capital letters and a few symbols. After Bliss&rsquo;s
death, practical considerations in keeping the system up-to-date and teaching
classifiers how to assign the numbers led the City College of New York library to
switch to LCC. John Mills continues to update the Bliss system,1 but its users re-
main a very small group of libraries.
</p>
<p>The discussion of faceted classifications raises the question of the choice of
characters used to represent the categories. Known as the notation, classifica-
tions may use only one type or more than one; for example, letters only or letters
and numbers. Single-character notation is called pure notation, and multi-
ple-character notation is called mixed notation. The DDC uses pure notation
(Arabic numbers, punctuated once with a dot or point, hence the name &ldquo;deci-
mal&rdquo;), whereas LCC uses a mixed notation consisting of capital letters and
Arabic numbers, sometimes punctuated by a dot or point. The type of notation
used creates a kind of limitation on how specific the subject categories tend to be
by resulting in longer or shorter combinations for topics at narrower levels of
specificity. The more specific a category is, the longer the number representing it
will be in a pure notation system; a mixed notation system has more flexibility to
vary the types and positions of the characters as needed to keep numbers short.
</p>
<p>Call Numbers
</p>
<p>Classification numbers, as mentioned, are the basis for placing materials on
library shelves. Numbers or alphabetic codes representing elements such as main
entries, particular collections, dates of publication, volume or copy numbers, and
so forth, known collectively as shelf marks, usually are added to the classifica-
tion number to complete the &ldquo;addresses&rdquo; for materials. The entire combination,
consisting of the classification number plus the shelf marks, is known as a call
number. Catalogs arranged by call number are common in libraries. They are
known as shelflists because they arrange the catalog records by each item&rsquo;s
placement on the shelf.
</p>
<p>Librarians are not unanimous about assigning a different call number to
each title in a library&rsquo;s collection. Larger agencies often choose to assign a
</p>
<p>Subject Authorities: Numbers for Classification 423</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>unique call number to each title; smaller ones may not have more than a few
items with the same classification number and shelf marks, and, thus, choose to
ignore the fact that several different titles can be shelved at the &ldquo;same&rdquo; address.
The word &ldquo;same&rdquo; is enclosed in quotations because two physical entities cannot
occupy the same space; rather, this means all the titles that share the same call
number may be randomly shelved at the designated location.
</p>
<p>The first shelf mark assigned after an item is classified usually is, by an un-
official agreement, an alphanumeric code representing the main entry of the item
called a cutter number. The name comes from the fact that Charles A. Cutter was
the first to publish a list of these codes, later revised by a librarian named Margaret
Sanborn, into tables called Cutter tables or Cutter-Sanborn tables.2 Today the
name is spelled with a small &ldquo;c&rdquo; in the phrase cutter number and is also a
verb&mdash;librarians refer to assigning these numbers as &ldquo;cuttering&rdquo; them.
</p>
<p>Small agencies sometimes add call letters (one or several) rather than cutter
numbers to their classification numbers to form call numbers, because call letters
are easier to apply. The first letter, first two letters, or first three letters of the
main entry are used as call letters. If the main entry is a title, the call letters are
not taken from initial articles but from the word following them. Call letters for a
book by Jane Austen could be A, AU/Au, or AUS/Aus, depending on the size of
the collection and type of lettering preferred. Call numbers resulting from this
system often are not unique for each item, because items with the same classifi-
cation number and call letters will have the same call number, for example,
books on the same subject by authors named Rose, Rosen, and/or Ross. In a
small collection this does not hinder retrieval and saves money in the classifier&rsquo;s
time and the purchase of special tools for cuttering.
</p>
<p>Other elements in a call number include a symbol, usually a letter of the al-
phabet, for the particular collection to which an item belongs, such as &ldquo;R&rdquo; for ref-
erence materials or &ldquo;J&rdquo; for children&rsquo;s materials. Such symbols often precede
classification numbers and identify the location of an item. Alphabetic designa-
tions for biography (B), fiction (F/FIC/Fic), oversized items (O), and audiovisual
materials (AV) are popular, also. Within a collection, subcategories may be dis-
tinguished, also, by the use of spine labels depicting icons for science fiction (an
atom), mystery (a gun), westerns (a rearing horse), or Canadian items (a maple
leaf). These labels describe content rather than location but can be used for loca-
tion as well.
</p>
<p>A popular addition to a cutter number symbolizing an author main entry for
an author who wrote more than one title is a letter or two from the first significant
word in each title. This addition results in arranging the author&rsquo;s works on the
shelf in alphabetical order by title without having to look beyond the call number
to read the entire title. This is an ingenious method, but it tends to lengthen call
numbers and make them complicated to assign as well as to use in retrieving de-
sired items from the shelves.
</p>
<p>Other call number elements frequently encountered in libraries are dates,
used particularly to distinguish two or more editions of the same title. Thus a
copy of the 21st edition of DDC shelved in the reference collection might have
</p>
<p>424 18&mdash;Subject Analysis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the complex LCC call number R/Z696/.D519/1999, in which the meaning is as
follows:
</p>
<p>R = Reference collection
</p>
<p>Z696 = LCC classification number for classifications
</p>
<p>.D519 = The cutter number for Dewey, the author main entry
</p>
<p>1999 = Date of the edition
</p>
<p>Because the DDC is a four-volume work, each volume would also be iden-
tified by its number, following the date. Complex call numbers such as this may
be useful for staff in large libraries who shelve many items with similar or identi-
cal classification numbers, cutters, and other shelf marks, but they are hard for
members of the public to remember when they go from the catalog to the shelf,
and difficult to write down without making mistakes.

</p>
<p>Two kinds of principles apply to subject cataloging&mdash;those that apply to the
way words and phrases are chosen to be used as subject headings and those that
apply to the way those words and phrases are assigned to materials. According
to Cutter, the catalog should show what the library has on a subject and bring
together all items on a single subject. Both objectives&mdash;identifying and
gathering&mdash;apply to subject headings and subject catalogs as well as to authors,
titles, and editions. Subject headings, which consist of words, raise issues arising
from the nature of language and, also, the use of words to represent subject
concepts.
</p>
<p>Subject catalogs can be arranged alphabetically or in classified order. North
Americans are familiar with alphabetical subject indexes because this is how
their library catalogs usually are arranged. Classified catalogs may contain the
same terms, but arranged in subject order, with the broadest topics given first,
followed by related but narrower topics in a logical organization for each major
subject division. The library shelflist is a good example of a classified catalog.
However, the rest of this section focuses on subject catalogs consisting of cata-
log records filed by their subject headings.
</p>
<p>In a classified catalog, the entire catalog might be divided into a few sec-
tions or main classes, for example, HUMANITIES, NATURAL SCIENCES,
and SOCIAL SCIENCES. NATURAL SCIENCES would be the broadest term
in that section, followed by individual scientific disciplines: ASTRONOMY,
MATHEMATICS, PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, GEOLOGY, and so
forth. In turn, CHEMISTRY would be followed by still smaller topics, such as
ORGANIC CHEMISTRY and INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. It is easy to see the
contrast with an alphabetical, or dictionary, catalog such as those in most media
centers and public libraries. There, the same topics would be arranged as follows:
ASTRONOMY, BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, GEOLOGY, HUMANITIES,
INORGANIC CHEMISTRY, MATHEMATICS, NATURAL SCIENCES,

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, and SOCIAL SCIENCES.
HUMANITIES seems oddly placed, sandwiched in between GEOLOGY and
INORGANIC CHEMISTRY, and five of the natural science disciplines and one
subdiscipline appear before the heading for natural sciences as a whole. To users
of a classified catalog, this would seem peculiar. Classified catalogs often em-
ploy classification numbers&mdash;coded representations of topics and subtopics.
</p>
<p>A hybrid catalog, partly classified and partly alphabetical, also has been de-
vised, called an alphabetico-classified catalog. In this catalog, principal head-
ings are in classified order, but within each level of hierarchy, subheadings are
arranged alphabetically (see Figure 18.1)

<p>In Figure 18.1, levels of hierarchy are distinguished by indentations, but
other devices, such as thumbtabs or guidecards, and color coding, can be used
when indentations are inconvenient to display, and the hierarchical levels need
not be identified at all. A knowledgeable searcher knows that ASTRONOMY
falls under NATURAL SCIENCES and that STARS follows COMETS and
PLANETS under the broader heading ASTRONOMY.
</p>
<p>The arrangement of terms can vary, but the choice of terms and their assign-
ment flow from one set of principles:
</p>
<p>1. Synonyms cannot be used simultaneously as headings in a single cat-
alog. Librarians rely on subject authorities to avoid using two head-
ings that mean the same thing, e.g., AUTOMOBILES versus CARS.
If both terms are likely to be searched, both may be listed, but only
one is authorized for use; the other will refer to the term actually used.
</p>
<p>2. Words used for subject headings should have one clear and precise
meaning. Subject authorities avoid words with more than one mean-
ing, or, when they must use such a word, they add something that indi-
cates the intended meaning, for example, BARS (ENGINEERING),
BARS (FURNITURE), BARS (GEOMORPHOLOGY), and BARS
(DRINKING ESTABLISHMENTS).
</p>
<p>3. The meaning of terms assigned as subject headings must be defined
precisely and must match the topics they represent. The terms should
not be broader or more specific than the topics they represent; for
example, if CALCULATORS is a heading, it should be defined to
exclude computers, which, although they manipulate numbers, are a
different type of machine. In Sears List of Subject Headings, the
scope note at CALCULATORS says: &ldquo;Use for materials on present-
day calculators or on calculators and mechanical computers made be-
fore 1945. Materials on modern electronic computers developed after
1945 are entered under Computers.&rdquo;3
</p>
<p>4. Each subject heading term should be discrete with respect to all others
at the same topical level. Problems occur when overlaps in mean-
ing occur between subject headings at the same level of hierarchy,
such as BIOLOGY, BIOCHEMISTRY, and CHEMISTRY. Where
does BIOLOGY end and BIOCHEMISTRY begin? Where does
BIOCHEMISTRY end and CHEMISTRY begin? If all are used in the
same catalog, each must cover discrete territory.
</p>
<p>David Judson Haykin, a respected head of LC&rsquo;s subject division in the
1950s, codified the principles that should apply to subject heading assignment at
LC. They are based, for the most part, on Cutter&rsquo;s ideas, and remain to this day
the definitive expression of our basic assumptions about subject heading practice:
</p>
<p>1. The Reader as the Focus. The primary consideration in choosing a
word as a subject heading is that it is the one searchers are most likely
to seek in the catalog.
</p>
<p>Principles of Subject Cataloging 427</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. Unity. A subject catalog must gather under one heading all the materi-
als that deal with the subject, whatever terms are applied to it by au-
thors, and whatever changing terms are used at different times. The
cataloger must choose the term with care and apply it uniformly to all
materials on the subject.
</p>
<p>3. Usage. The heading chosen should be in common usage.
</p>
<p>4. English versus Foreign Terms. English-language terms are preferred
unless a concept is foreign to Anglo-American experience, or when a
foreign term is precise while its English counterpart is not.
</p>
<p>5. Specificity. When assigned, headings should be as specific as the top-
ics they cover, not broader. Rather than apply a broader heading, cata-
logers should use two specific headings that will approximately cover
the topic.4
</p>
<p>(�����(����&amp;*�������*���
�&amp;�
</p>
<p>Classification systems use language to identify the categories into which
they divide knowledge, but words do not appear in the codes ultimately assigned
to materials. These codes are called &ldquo;numbers,&rdquo; even when they consist of char-
acters other than digits. It is the notation that appears, which frees classifications
from many of the linguistic issues that affect subject headings and subject cata-
logs. Still, the principles on which classifications are based raise other issues and
generate problems of their own.
</p>
<p>An issue of importance is the underlying philosophy of the classification,
which dictates the method chosen to distinguish subjects from one another. A
series of main classes is selected as the first analysis of knowledge into smaller
components. Then, subsequent subdivisions may follow the same pattern or dif-
ferent patterns, and all subject areas may be treated alike or each subject area
may be treated differently, according to ideas associated solely with that area.
One might begin by dividing the universe of knowledge into animal, vegetable,
and mineral. Or one might divide it into humanities, social sciences, and sci-
ences. Some might divide it into earth, sky, fire, and water. Library classifica-
tions usually divide knowledge into disciplines familiar to academia. The DDC
begins with ten main classes; LCC with twenty-one; Colon Classification with
forty-one. None of these systems is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; &ldquo;better&rdquo; or worse&rdquo;; none is
&ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo; They simply start from different perspectives and draw their
boundaries differently.
</p>
<p>A classification must cover all the knowledge areas needed for the materials
in the collection, which, for general libraries, means all of them. A medical li-
brary might not need a classification that deals in detail with music and religion,
but some subtopics related to these disciplines need to be covered. For example,
music therapy and medical problems unique to musicians, and faith healing and
religious tenets pertaining to medicine and medical practice, would have to be
included, subsumed under rubrics other than &ldquo;music&rdquo; or &ldquo;religion.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>428 18&mdash;Subject Analysis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To function over time, a classification must be open to the inclusion of new
subjects not known when the classification was first devised, called &ldquo;hospital-
ity.&rdquo; It is difficult to predict where new topics and subtopics will emerge or
whether changes will occur in the relationships among topics, but since knowl-
edge does not stand still, the classification must be able to handle the changes.
</p>
<p>To be easily used, the system must follow logical, recognizable patterns,
both for the people using its numbers to find materials and for those assigning its
numbers to materials. Easily memorized notation is a feature that contributes to
ease of use. Short numbers also are more convenient than long ones, although in
hierarchical classifications in which the whole hierarchy preceding a very spe-
cific topic must be represented, the numbers can be quite long.
</p>
<p>The DDC and LCC both employ the principle of relative location, which
means that materials are shifted as new ones are acquired in order to incorporate
the new items with others on the same subjects. Both also operate on the princi-
ple of classification by discipline, although their definitions of the word differ.
The DDC has fewer main classes than LCC, even though both cover the entire
range of subject matter. The following examples reveal some (although not all)
of the differences between the two systems:
</p>
<p>&bull; DDC has one main class for all social sciences (300), LCC has four: H, J,
K, and L.
</p>
<p>&bull; DDC makes medicine a subdivision of technology and applied science
(612), while LCC makes it a main class R.
</p>
<p>&bull; DDC divides language and literature into two separate main classes (400
and 800, respectively), whereas LCC combines them into one huge main
class (P).
</p>
<p>The philosophies underlying DDC and LCC differ considerably. The for-
mer is a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; classification of all knowledge, whereas LCC is intended
merely to shelve LC&rsquo;s materials in a logical kind of subject order. The DDC fol-
lows one set of rules for all parts of the classification; LCC only requires that the
same rules be used within a main class, but permits different rules to apply be-
tween classes.
</p>
<p>Library classifications use different methods of subdividing subjects within
the classification. The DDC usually employs hierarchy, breaking subject matter
down from the broadest to the narrowest category according to the nature of the
subject. Numbers are given to the broadest category (e.g., science = 500), then to
the subcategories into which that subject can be broken down (e.g., astronomy =
520, physics = 530, chemistry = 540, etc.), then to the sub-subcategories into
which the subcategories can be divided (e.g., inorganic chemistry = 546 and
organic chemistry = 547), and so on until the smallest identifiable category
receives a number. The LCC uses more than one strategy for subdividing topics,
including hierarchy, geography, chronology, and simple alphabetization, often
provided by means of cuttering.
</p>
<p>Principles of Classification 429</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Some classification systems choose not to reflect the subject content of ma-
terials and primarily provide shelf location, not subject access. One such system
assigns numbers to materials sequentially as each item is added to a collection;
for example, book 1 is the first book acquired, book 2 is the second, and so forth.
This is called an &ldquo;accession number&rdquo; system and reflects the order of acquisition.
In an accession number system, materials are not shifted when new items arrive.
Once classified, materials can be expected to remain in the same place for as long
as they are held. A similar system alphabetizes materials, shelving them by a
chosen element, usually authors&rsquo; names or title words. These systems are logical,
follow recognizable patterns, and provide shelf addresses for materials, but they
fail to reveal subject matter or group materials on a subject in one place on the
shelves. Caution should be used before adopting these systems, because they do
not promote browsing and are costly to change.
</p>
<p>Canadian and U.S. library classifications, because they are used primarily
for shelving, tend to be two dimensional or linear. The numbers start at the first
one and proceed one after the other to the last one, for example, 001-999 for
DDC or A-Z for LCC. Knowledge does not behave in a linear fashion. It moves
in many directions simultaneously. Think of the topics mentioned previously:
medicine, music, and religion. These are disciplines in their own right, but they
also have cross-disciplinary meetings, such as music therapy or faith healing.
Music therapy is also related to religious music and aroma therapy, and faith
healing is related to faith-based charities and meditational chants, both of
which can be involved in medical treatment. Topics do not proceed one after
the other in linear fashion, but branch out helter-skelter in all directions. All the
relationships cannot be maintained simultaneously, except in a faceted system
in which the related parts can be moved about to stand together, on request.
When a faceted classification is used for shelving, only some of the numbers
can be used. In a catalog or a bibliography, however, all the numbers can be
displayed, as appropriate, in different places in the number sequence to show
each of the facets to a searcher, as shown in Figure 18.2. (Note the similarity to
keyword searching.)

</p>
<p>Principles of Classification 431
</p>
<p>In the DDC, Music = 780; Medicine = 610; and Religion = 200.
If DDC were faceted, the topics discussed above could be expressed as
follows:
</p>
<p>Music therapy = 780 + 610 (music plus medical treatment)
</p>
<p>Faith healing = 200 + 610 (religion plus medical treatment)
</p>
<p>Religious music = 200 + 780 (religion plus music)
</p>
<p>A catalog or a bibliography could list them as follows:
</p>
<p>200 + 610 = Faith healing
</p>
<p>200 + 780 = Religious music
</p>
<p>610 + 200 = Healing by faith
</p>
<p>610 + 780 = Healing by music
</p>
<p>780 + 200 = Music in religion
</p>
<p>780 + 610 = Music therapy
</p>
<p>Rules for shelving can permit only one sequence, however, such as
listing the facets from lower to higher numbers only. Each topic is shelved
in one place, based on the six assigned numbers. The result is:
</p>
<p>200610 = Faith healing
</p>
<p>200780 = Religious music
</p>
<p>610780 = Music therapy</p>

</p>
<p>Subject catalogs can be evaluated using at least six criteria: recall, rele-
vance, precision, exhaustivity, ease of use, and cost. They are described in detail
in this section.
</p>
<p>Recall
</p>
<p>Recall refers to the amount of material retrieved when a heading is used in a
search. To be &ldquo;good,&rdquo; the catalog should provide &ldquo;enough&rdquo; material, but not
overwhelm. If every movie in a very large collection of videorecordings of
made-for-television movies had a different subject heading, the recall would be
one item per subject heading. If all the items were assigned TELEVISION
MOVIES, the searcher would retrieve all of them with that heading. Between
these extremes, a balance is sought. Someone using a subject heading should re-
call all items related to the subject but exclude unrelated items.
</p>
<p>Relevance
</p>
<p>Relevance refers to how well materials retrieved using a subject heading
match the searcher&rsquo;s needs. A &ldquo;good&rdquo; subject catalog earns high marks here. The
more specific a search is, the more likely what is found will be relevant. If a
searcher wants something about computer programming and uses the subject
heading PROGRAMMING (ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS), he or she should
recall every item in the collection about the subject. However, that heading is as-
signed only to items entirely about the topic, not to items with just a chapter
about it. If the broader subject heading COMPUTERS were added to the original
search, the searcher could retrieve items having a chapter or two about program-
ming, but this larger batch of material would also contain material about hard-
ware, computer architecture, network design, and other irrelevant subjects. The
quality of relevance tends to decrease as the amount of recall increases. These
two qualities are said to have an inverse relationship.
</p>
<p>Precision
</p>
<p>Precision is the ability to specify exactly what is wanted, without using
broader subject headings representing other things as well. Imagine that the
searcher in our previous example was really interested only in items about
programming in BASIC, one programming language. PROGRAMMING
(ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS) would retrieve material on all programming
languages, including BASIC. If, however, the searcher used the subject heading
BASIC (COMPUTER PROGRAM LANGUAGE), that would allow for much
more precision than if COMPUTERS and PROGRAMMING (ELECTRONIC
</p>
<p>432 18&mdash;Subject Analysis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>COMPUTERS) were the only terms available. Precision varies with term specific-
ity as well as with definition and application. Precision is also affected by the
presence of overlapping and ambiguous terms.
</p>
<p>Exhaustivity
</p>
<p>Exhaustivity refers to the amount (or depth) of subject cataloging. Some
catalogers give each item only one subject heading. Others may give up to three
or five headings, both common practices, to cover the overall subject matter of
each item. Some catalogers might wish to furnish subject headings for each
chapter of a book or each part of an electronic resource. This is a deeper level,
furnishing greater exhaustivity. The highest marks for exhaustivity go to the cat-
alog furnishing subject headings for every idea contained within an item.
</p>
<p>Ease of Use
</p>
<p>Two kinds of people use the subject catalog: staff members who assign sub-
ject headings to materials or search the catalog to answer questions, and library
users who search the catalog themselves. The subject heading system should be
easy for both kinds of people to use.
</p>
<p>Cost
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;good&rdquo; subject catalog should maximize value by providing the most ser-
vice possible for the money spent on it. It also must be affordable. Evaluating the
cost is done by considering the impact. If searchers need to ask for help less of-
ten, freeing the reference staff for other duties, costly subject cataloging is justi-
fied. If searchers have to ask for help just as frequently, the expense is not worth
it. A subject system that enabled a computer or clerical staff to do the work
would be less costly than one that only librarians could apply. Cost is relative,
and no standard measures for high- and low-cost cataloging exist. However,
variations in cost and resulting service can be measured, if objective definitions
of service are devised (e.g., &ldquo;better&rdquo; service = fewer requests for assistance with
searches, or &ldquo;better&rdquo; service = an increase in use of materials with no more than a
2 percent increase in requests for assistance with searches). Then, experiments
for balancing cost and service can be done.
</p>
<p>There are tradeoffs in producing and using subject catalogs. One criterion
cannot measure a catalog&rsquo;s worth, and all must be put into a reasonable balance
to achieve good service at bearable cost. No magic formulas dictate how deeply
to index or how many cross-references to make, but problems demand the atten-
tion of concerned practitioners.
</p>
<p>Evaluating Subject Catalogs 433</p>
<p/>

��&amp;%
</p>
<p>Problems occur when different terms are used to express a topic (often due
to changes in the meaning and usage of words over time or between the works of
different authors); when topics overlap; when the number of records recalled in
an average search is too great or too small; and, perhaps most critical of all, when
authorized headings and searchers&rsquo; vocabularies do not match. A person using
a term that is not present in the catalog either as a subject heading or a cross-
reference will find nothing. To promote the identification feature of the subject
catalog, all words used by searchers and authors should be present as headings.
But if that were done, how would works on a single subject be brought together?
To promote the collocating feature, synonymous and quasi-synonymous terms
must be combined in a few carefully defined terms, whose specificity results in
reasonable numbers of relevant retrieved items.
</p>
<p>These conflicts have no single resolution, but computers offer new possi-
bilities. Computers enable catalog users to search terms found in titles, summa-
ries, or other areas in bibliographic descriptions containing information about
the content of works in &ldquo;natural language&rdquo; in addition to the designated subject
headings. Computers permit searching any word of a subject heading, called a
subject &ldquo;keyword,&rdquo; even if it is not the first word of a heading, which was not
possible with card catalogs, in which only the word in the filing position (called
the &ldquo;lead term&rdquo;) could be searched. Additional retrieval capabilities made possi-
ble when subject catalogs are computerized include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Searches with partial data (e.g., if an asterisk stands for any letters,
COMPUT* can retrieve both COMPUTERS and COMPUTING, while
*COMPUT* can retrieve both of those plus MICROCOMPUTERS and
MINICOMPUTERS);
</p>
<p>&bull; Saving search requests and using them in more than one database or catalog;
</p>
<p>&bull; Combining more than one subject heading into complex requests, e.g.,
COMPUTERS AND ART, or MUSIC AND POPULAR NOT JAZZ, or
combining a subject heading with other bibliographic elements in a sin-
gle search, e.g., SU=SYMPHONIES AND AU=MOZART;
</p>
<p>&bull; Accessing the catalog from outside the library via networks; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Accessing local acquisition and circulation data as well as catalog re-
cords, so a searcher can determine an item&rsquo;s availability.
</p>
<p>This list is not exhaustive. The boundaries between search capabilities that
require use of a particular kind of subject vocabulary and those that only need a
properly programmed computer system are blurring The use of computers did
not make controlled vocabularies obsolete, as some predicted in the 1980s;
rather, it led to intensified efforts to improve controlled vocabularies and de-
velop new ways to search data elements likely to express subject content.

<p/>

�&amp;��
</p>
<p>Criteria similar to those used in evaluating subject catalogs can be applied
to classifications. They include the level of specificity afforded by the system;
the browsability it produces; its ease of use, including understandable notation,
mnemonics, indexing, and simple rules for the assignment of numbers; its hospi-
tality to new subjects; regular updating; and its cost.
</p>
<p>The level of specificity should be appropriate to the size and distribution of
the library&rsquo;s collections. If it has only a few broad numbers, many items on di-
verse aspects of a topic will be classified in the same number. If it has a great
many narrow numbers, very few items will be classified in the same number
even if their content is closely related. A balance appropriate to the collection
being classified should be sought, although accommodations must be made by
individual libraries to classification systems intended for large numbers of users.
</p>
<p>Browsability as a feature of classifications depends to a large degree on the
subject relationships it presents. In most instances, progression from broader to
narrower topics in a subject area enhances browsing. The logic of subject rela-
tionships should be clear to a searcher, making it possible to anticipate where to
look for a desired subject or subdivision. The juxtaposition of subjects is also a
concern relating to browsability. Folklore and cannibalism are only a few num-
bers apart in the DDC, whereas English language and English literature are sev-
eral hundreds of numbers apart. Similarly, dance and drama are quite far apart in
the LCC even though many people think of these as closely related performing
arts.
</p>
<p>The ease of use depends on many factors, including an easily remembered,
easily understood type of notation. The flexibility of the notation to handle nu-
merous narrow categories while still being economical also affects the ease of
use, as does mnemonic numbering (using the same number for a topic or
subtopic wherever it appears). The presence of good indexes to the numbers is
essential, both for classifiers and ordinary searchers. An asset for classifiers is
the existence of relatively uncomplicated rules for assigning the numbers.
</p>
<p>No classification system can boast that it covers subjects as yet unknown,
but how these are handled when they emerge is a matter of concern. Ideally, a
hospitable system will be able to incorporate them into the list of numbers in a
way that retains appropriate relations with related subjects. Practically speaking,
this can also mean having to revise many related areas, as was the case when the
subject of computers emerged. Thus, classifications must be updated regularly to
add or alter categories as our knowledge of subjects and perceptions of their rela-
tionships change over the years.
</p>
<p>Finally, the cost of using a classification is an important aspect of its total
value. If a cataloger adopts the same classification as his or her peers and can
share the burden of assigning numbers to commonly held materials, it is likely to
be less costly than using a unique classification and doing all the work alone.
Cost was a major factor in the decision of many college and university libraries
to change from previously used classifications to the LCC after OCLC&rsquo;s shared
cataloging database was established. Because LC&rsquo;s cataloging constituted the
lion&rsquo;s share of the records in OCLC in its early days, it was less costly for other
</p>
<p>Evaluating Classifications 435</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>OCLC member libraries to copy its numbers and avoid the burden of classifying
the same materials differently. Other cost factors include the relative ease or dif-
ficulty for classifiers of assigning the numbers&mdash;the longer it takes to classify a
title, the more it costs&mdash;and the cost of the tool itself, along with whatever ac-
companying manuals, supplements, and so forth are needed to use it.
</p>
<p>It may be difficult to quantify some of these features, such as browsability
or ease of use, but it is worth making a serious effort to do so whenever changes
in a library&rsquo;s classification practices are contemplated. It may be that savings
will be achieved in some areas, while new costs are incurred in others. Some-
times the savings is only to the library, and the searchers must do more work to
find what they want. Thus, the value of a classification should be figured as a
total package.

</p>
<p>Policy decisions about maintenance of subject catalogs should be made and
publicized to those who use them. An important decision is whether to interfile
subject headings with headings for authors and titles. When card catalogs were
the rule, the choice usually was a function of the size of the file and the ease with
which people could search it. Since the advent of OPACs, even large catalogs are
interfiled, because the computer does the legwork. If, however, searchers must
select an index (subject, title, keyword, or name) when they enter a search term,
as is common in OPACs, it is the same as dividing the file. The user must remem-
ber to search other files if the first attempt does not bring desired results.
</p>
<p>Another policy issue concerns cross-references. It may be difficult keeping
track of cross-references and changing them when necessary. They tend to pro-
liferate rapidly&mdash;one heading can have several cross-references, each of which
has more of its own. Decisions must be made about how extensively these will be
made.
</p>
<p>One thing searchers dislike are cross-references that lead to terms having
no materials listed under them, called a blind reference. Policies for maintaining
the cross-reference structure can prevent this from happening. Some librarians
believe cross-references teach users about related subjects and that all references
given in the subject heading list should be present in the catalog whether or not
they lead to any entries. (If such a policy is followed, catalogers can add nota-
tions to recordless headings explaining that the library has no holdings on those
topics.) Others believe the cost of creating and maintaining a living cross-reference
structure (called a syndetic structure) is unwarranted when it doesn&rsquo;t lead to use
of materials.
</p>
<p>Each library must weigh the various alternatives&mdash;to include all, some, or
no cross-references&mdash;and arrive at a viable policy for its searchers and its cata-
log. Some may find it necessary to decide about cross-references on a
case-by-case basis, but it is more efficient to systematize the policy so that indi-
vidual decisions are unnecessary.
</p>
<p>436 18&mdash;Subject Analysis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Finally, there are implications for maintenance in the way subject headings
are filed. Two different arrangements of subject headings are furnished by the
rules used at LC and those published by ALA.5 The Library of Congress&rsquo;s filing
rules distinguish between different subject heading forms and types of subdivi-
sions, whereas ALA&rsquo;s do not. Figure 18.3 illustrates how the use of each method
would cause an identical group of headings to be arranged. (The headings in the
two lists are fictitious.)
</p>
<p>Figure 18.3 Impact of Filing Rules.
</p>
<p>Maintenance of the library&rsquo;s classification system also involves policy de-
cisions. Foremost among these is how to incorporate updates to the system.
Ideally, all changes to the numbers should be adopted, which means the affected
materials and their catalog records are reprocessed with new numbers first, after
which the materials are shelved in their new locations. In a less-than-ideal world
in which staff time is at a premium, this might mean allowing new materials to go
untreated while staff revise materials that have already been treated once. Librar-
ians view such developments with displeasure and tend to resist adopting
changes in classification numbers. The authors recommend adopting changes
judiciously, over time, thus allowing the library to benefit from the results with-
out committing all its resources to the change at once. (This is discussed in
greater detail in Chapter 22.)

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A second matter of importance, especially for large collections, is the phys-
ical organization of the shelves. Choices include starting with the first number
and following through to the last, all in one sequence; or, alternatively, grouping
parts of the collection out of sequence in specially designated locations. For
those who make the latter choice, music and art are two subjects often chosen to
be shelved out of sequence. Science and technology numbers are also frequently
grouped apart from the rest of the collection, sometimes in buildings of their
own. Reference works are often deployed out of sequence to provide equipment
or work space for users of these materials. Age can play a role, with older materi-
als stored in less accessible locations and new materials shelved in highly visible
locations. Every exception to the expected shelving system is likely to add some
extra time to a browser&rsquo;s task as well as to staff workload, but doing so is justi-
fied if it can be shown that the majority of people focus solely on specific
out-of-sequence materials. Few studies have been done to demonstrate whether
this is the case, but lack of data has not dissuaded those who like the
nonsequential arrangements.
</p>
<p>�"#1��
�����)����*&amp;����
����)��&amp;�$�
</p>
<p>Assigning subject headings and classification numbers to literary
works&mdash;novels, plays, stories, poetry, and so forth&mdash;also called works of imagi-
nation, should be considered carefully. Regarding subject headings, policies at
LC, NLC, and other large libraries have limited the assignment of subject head-
ings to nonfiction works unless they are collections of texts by more than one
author, texts augmented by literary criticism, or historical or biographical works.
People are thought to seek literary works in the catalog by their authors or titles,
not by their subjects. Children and youth, however, often choose (or are guided
to choose by parents, teachers, media specialists, and librarians) to learn about
something by reading about it in stories. In the 1960s, in response to many re-
quests from librarians and media specialists, LC established new policies for
children&rsquo;s fiction providing both subject headings and summary notes (see Fig-
ure 18.4).
</p>
<p>Searchers have come to expect subject headings for children&rsquo;s fiction.
More recently, practitioners have argued for the assignment of headings for liter-
ary genres to adult fiction, for which ALA&rsquo;s Subject Analysis Committee pub-
lished guidelines and terminology.6 The Library of Congress experimented with
the new genre headings, found them helpful, and encourages others to do the
same. Libraries need to establish policies for subject access to literary works
based on estimates of searchers&rsquo; need for them and the library&rsquo;s ability do the
added work.
</p>
<p>Similarly, many public libraries choose not to classify fiction and biogra-
phy, preferring to assign them all one code such as F or Fic, B or Bio, or varia-
tions on those themes, and shelve the materials in alphabetical order by the
author&rsquo;s or biographee&rsquo;s surname. This assumes people will either browse the
shelves in person or search such materials in library catalogs by elements other

<p>than call number. Both assumptions may not be true, making the materials more
difficult to find. Academic libraries tend to classify everything, including works
of imagination, keeping them in the order prescribed by the classification
scheme. This aids catalog searchers and should not hinder browsers at the shelf.
</p>

</p>
<p>A library might be tempted to dispense with standard subject headings and
standard classification numbers. It might seem easier to make up appropriate
headings and numbers than to buy expensive tools like Sears, LCSH, DDC, or
LCC, and be bound by the terms they offer. Why invest time and money in them?
First, making up local subject headings and classification numbers puts the bur-
den of keeping track of selected terms entirely on the cataloger&rsquo;s shoulders. The
cataloger must also decide how to define terms and numbers and how they
should be applied. In the case of subject headings, the cataloger must decide
what cross-references should be made for each term; in the case of classification,
a consistent notation must be constructed. It is time consuming to create and
maintain subject and classification authorities, both in terms of other work one
hasn&rsquo;t time to do as well as the dollars paid. If other personnel help do subject
cataloging and classification, the list of headings and numbers must be made
available to them in a usable form. Even if all the work is done alone, a properly
written list is needed for searchers to consult.
</p>
<p>Second, a cataloger cannot use subject headings or classification numbers
assigned by other catalogers or benefit from the work he or she does. If the li-
brary enters a network environment, the terms can be accommodated as locally
defined headings and classification numbers, but no one else can use them. Also,
the cataloger cannot gain from copying the work of other network partners, be-
cause nearly all use standard subject and classification authorities.
</p>
<p>Third, the catalog is an ongoing tool, not the individual expression of one
collection at one point in time, managed by one librarian. Complete, explicit in-
structions on how headings or classification numbers have been chosen, used,
and managed, and a complete list of terms, cross-references, or numbers must be
provided to the cataloger&rsquo;s successors. Another librarian might not wish to con-
tinue the system or decide that it is not cost effective and opt to change to a stan-
dard system. Then the entire collection would require conversion. Establishing
unique subject headings or classification numbers should be undertaken only af-
ter the library has assessed the alternatives and rejected them for good reasons. A
nonstandard subject or classification authority could result in less effective ser-
vice, overall.
</p>
<p>The next two chapters examine the subject heading lists and classification
systems used by most libraries in North America: Sears, LCSH, DDC, and LCC.

</p>
<p>In this chapter, two lists used as the sources for subject headings, Library of
Congress Subject Headings and Sears List of Subject Headings, are described.
Together they are the most popular subject heading authorities used by libraries
in North America.
</p>
<p>��#���)�&amp;*��&amp;�%������"#1��

���'��%��;����&lt;
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) began publication in 1909,
based on a list of subject headings compiled and issued by the American Library
Association (ALA) called The List of Subject Headings for Use in Dictionary
Catalogs. The Library of Congress&rsquo;s subject catalogers adopted many headings
as they appeared in the ALA list, modified others, and created new ones when
they did not find what they needed. New editions appeared about once every ten
years until 1988, when conversion to a computerized database was completed.
Then, printed editions began to be issued annually. Versions in other forms have
also been made available.
</p>
<p>LCSH&rsquo;s wide appeal is attributable to three factors: (1) that LC collects many
more books in nearly all subjects than other general libraries, (2) that it does a fine
job of maintaining and distributing the ever-growing list of authorized subject head-
ings and cross-references, and (3) that it charges very little for the work.
</p>
<p>Because LCSH&rsquo;s vocabulary grew, and continues to grow, based on the
contents of items in LC&rsquo;s collection, it lacks headings for topics not included in
that collection. Moreover, LCSH has lacked a consistent set of rules for creat-
ing new headings during nearly a century of growth. Subject headings were
created according to the theories and ideas of many catalogers and heads of
subject cataloging.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Detailed instructions for applying LCSH are provided separately in Subject
Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings, available on the Cataloger&rsquo;s Desktop
CD-ROM.1 The manual cumulates decisions and interpretations originally used
by LC&rsquo;s subject catalogers and later published in response to requests for guide-
lines that everyone who uses LCSH could follow. The manual covers general is-
sues first, followed by sections on the treatment of selected types of topics, and,
last, the use of each of the general subdivisions known as free-floating subdivi-
sions (see below), arranged alphabetically.
</p>
<p>Cataloging networks and some individual libraries have access to the on-
line subject authority file maintained at LC, but most libraries buy it in offline
form. It is available in annually issued books or more frequent issues in micro-
fiche and CD-ROM. The CD-ROM version is titled Classification Plus.2
</p>
<p>The printed LCSH contains approximately 750,000 authorized terms and
cross-references on more than 5,000 pages bound in five massive volumes with
distinctive red covers. They are not a complete system, however, because they
lack the list of free-floating subdivisions that can be added to topical descriptors
to give them greater specificity. Free-floating subdivisions are found in Subject
Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings and in a separate publication,
Free-Floating Subdivisions: An Alphabetic Index, issued annually.3 Rules for
their use are found in both publications. Updates to the printed LCSH are avail-
able in electronic form on the World Wide Web at http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir
/cpso/wls.html, and in printed form in weekly lists4 and quarterly Cataloging
Service bulletins (CSB).5 Together, the books, the manual, the subdivision
guide, and the updates constitute a complete LCSH subject heading authority
system.
</p>
<p>Authorized headings are listed in bold print; unauthorized headings and
cross-references in plain print. LCSH prints headings three columns to a page
(see Figure 19.1).
</p>
<p>Most headings and cross-references are topical terms. Although some
names appear in the list (see Figure 19.1), LCSH does not control them; instead,
names of people, geographic locations, and corporate bodies, and all titles used
as subject headings in the catalog, are controlled by a name authority file sepa-
rate from the subject authority file. (LC&rsquo;s name authority file can be used for this
purpose by any institution.) Catalogers are directed to add name and title head-
ings as needed, using the form prescribed by AACR2-98. With a few exceptions,
catalogers may not add topical headings; instead, they must use the most appro-
priate authorized heading already present in the list, and hope that LC will add
the desired headings before long.
</p>
<p>Coded instructions (UF, BT, RT, SA, and NT, explained below) for making
cross-references appear with their subject headings. Cross-references are given
in that order and, within each category, in alphabetical order. If a subject head-
ing&rsquo;s meaning might be in question, instructions are given about how to use it,
beginning with the words &ldquo;Here are entered . . .&rdquo; The instructions usually are
framed in positive language, but occasionally will add what should not be en-
tered under a particular heading as well.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Library of Congress classification numbers are listed for many headings
and some of the subdivisions as well. These are just suggestions and should not
be assigned without consulting the full classification schedules. They are a use-
ful shortcut alternative to consulting page after page of numbers in crowded por-
tions of the schedules or as a guide in unfamiliar territory.
</p>
<p>LCSH uses several grammatical constructions, from one-word headings
to complex multiword headings. One-word headings usually are nouns or verb
forms used as nouns, such as, BLEACHING. Different meanings can depend
on whether the noun is singular or plural, for example, BONE is used for the
generic skeletal material, while BONES is used for skeletal structures in humans
and animals.
</p>
<p>A noun modified by an adjective or a second noun used as an adjective is
another grammatical type, for example, CABLE TELEVISION. LCSH some-
times reverses the order in which the words appear to bring the more important
word to the filing position, for example, CARBOHYDRATES, REFINED. With
computer-based keyword searching, the order of words is not critical, but in
card files where only the initial word is searchable, it is important. Two-word
headings also are formulated as nouns with explanatory qualifiers to ensure
their correct interpretation, such as EQUILIBRIUM (ECONOMICS) and
EQUILIBRIUM (PHYSIOLOGY).
</p>
<p>Another heading type is two nouns connected by a conjunction, such as
&ldquo;AND,&rdquo; for example, CARRIAGES AND CARTS or ART AND SCIENCE.
The nouns can represent similar things or opposites. Complex headings in
this category may include modified nouns, such as LANDSCAPE
ARCHITECTURE AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. Prepositions also can
link two nouns or modified nouns in another type of heading, for example,
HISTORY IN ART, TITLES OF BOOKS, COOKERY FOR THE SICK, and
BIBLE AS LITERATURE.
</p>
<p>More complex headings can involve both multiword concepts and combi-
nations of concepts, such as DO-IT-YOURSELF PRODUCTS INDUSTRY.
Sometimes these are simplified; for example, ERRATA (IN BOOKS) was
changed to ERRATA, and CONVENTS AND NUNNERIES, BUDDHIST to
BUDDHIST CONVENTS. In other cases, revisions add to headings to clarify
them or expand their scope; for example, some years ago PETER&rsquo;S DENIAL
IN ART became JESUS CHRIST&mdash;DENIAL BY PETER&mdash;ART, and the
one-word heading CLARET was changed to WINE AND WINE
MAKING&mdash;FRANCE&mdash;BORDELAIS.
</p>
<p>LCSH headings and subject heading strings are filed according to a set of
rules that facilitates computerized filing, devised by John C. Rather.6 The system
files word by word with digits preceding alphabetic characters, and treats letter
combinations as they appear (for example, Dr. files as &ldquo;D-r-period,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo;).
LC&rsquo;s filing rules distinguish between different kinds of subject heading forms
and subdivisions, unlike the rules used to file Sears headings (see below). Recog-
nition of headings and heading-subdivision forms occurs automatically, based
on their computer coding. (Coding is discussed in Chapter 21.) The result is that
headings consisting of one word and this word plus subdivisions all appear be-
fore multiword headings beginning with the same word. In filing, the order of the
</p>
<p>446 19&mdash;Subject Headings Lists</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>subdivisions is chronological subdivisions first, followed by topical subdivi-
sions, then geographical subdivisions. In LCSH and in large catalogs in which
many entries appear under a term and its subdivisions, searchers need to realize
that ART AND INDUSTRY, which is a multiword heading, can be many pages
or screens beyond ART&mdash;THEMES, MOTIVES, which is a subdivided heading,
because the rules give filing preference to subdivided headings.
</p>
<p>Cross-References in LCSH
</p>
<p>Cross-references in LCSH are identified by a set of standard mnemonic ab-
breviations mandated by the National Information Standards Organization: BT
(Broader Term), RT (Related Term), NT (Narrower Term), UF (Use For), SA
(See Also), and USE. LCSH does not specify the highest term in a subject hierar-
chy, identified as TT (Top Term), nor does it show the entire range of steps in a
subject area from the broadest to the narrowest term such as those found in the
National Library of Medicine&rsquo;s Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).7 Cross-
references in LCSH lead a searcher one level of hierarchy broader (BT) or nar-
rower (NT), but the practical application policy is to make only NT references in
the catalog display. BT references are given in the list for consultation only. RTs
at the same level of hierarchy have reciprocal cross-references, and both appear
in the catalog display.
</p>
<p>As the name implies, BTs lead from the heading at which they appear to
broader headings in the same subject. This is called leading &ldquo;upward.&rdquo; Similarly,
NTs lead to narrower terms in the same subject, called leading &ldquo;downward.&rdquo; RTs
lead to headings at the same level of hierarchy in a related area, which might
be in the same subject or another subject associated with it. The relationships of
these three types of cross-references to the heading at which they appear are
clear from their names. The other three types&mdash;SA, UF, and USE&mdash;bear more
explanation.
</p>
<p>SAs are references from the heading at which they appear to groups of
headings, rather than individual headings. They also can instruct catalogers to
consult other headings or add headings and subdivisions that do not appear in the
list. For example, at BOOKS, it says: &ldquo;SA headings beginning with the word
book &rdquo; and at COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, it says, &ldquo;SA names of individual
products.&rdquo; Occasionally, catalogers are told to use the heading at which the SA
appears as a subdivision under specific types of other headings; for example, at
ART it says, &ldquo;SA subdivision ART under names of individual persons who lived
before 1400, under names of deities or legendary figures, and under headings of
the type [TOPIC]&mdash;[SUBDIVISION] . . . .&rdquo; In most instances, terms used as sub-
ject headings may not be used as subdivisions, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>UF and USE are reciprocal, that is, wherever a UF is given leading to an-
other heading, a USE heading will appear at the target heading leading back to
the original one. UFs appear at authorized headings and are intended mainly for
catalogers, telling them to make cross-references from unauthorized headings
for a subject that searchers are likely to try to the authorized headings for that
subject. The reciprocal USE headings appear under the unauthorized headings
and reveal which authorized headings to use instead for the subject. The two
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) 447</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>headings ACCELERATED EROSION (unauthorized) and SOIL EROSION
(authorized) illustrate the point. ACCELERATED EROSION has a USE refer-
ence to SOIL EROSION; SOIL EROSION has a reciprocal UF for
ACCELERATED EROSION. In practice, this means that when the heading
SOIL EROSION is first assigned, catalogers should also make a cross-reference
for the UF heading ACCELERATED EROSION. Then, when a searcher looks
up ACCELERATED EROSION, which is a common term for the subject not au-
thorized by LCSH, he or she will find the cross-reference to the authorized head-
ing, &ldquo;USE SOIL EROSION.&rdquo; The reference should look like this:
</p>
<p>ACCELERATED EROSION. Use SOIL EROSION
</p>
<p>The USE reference remains in the catalog until the last item on the subject
SOIL EROSION is removed from the collection and that heading is removed.
Accompanying the removal of SOIL EROSION, the cross-reference
ACCELERATED EROSION, which would then be obsolete, also is removed.
Otherwise, the cross-reference leads to a heading with no materials under it,
known as a blind reference. Blind references frustrate searchers because they fail
to retrieve relevant materials, although some believe that just learning the proper
subject heading to use for future searches is a sufficiently productive result.
</p>
<p>Instructions direct that cross-references are made for the public catalog dis-
play only from a given heading to the narrower and related headings listed with
it, and not to the broader headings, which are provided mainly for the cataloger&rsquo;s
use. For example, at BOAT LIVING an NT reference leads to SAILBOAT
LIVING and at SAILBOAT LIVING a BT reference leads to BOAT LIVING.
When the first item is cataloged under the narrower heading, SAILBOAT
LIVING, no cross-reference is made to the broader heading, BOAT LIVING;
but when the first item is cataloged under the broader heading, BOAT LIVING, a
cross-reference should be made to the narrower heading, SAILBOAT LIVING
(provided materials are listed under it). It will look like the following:
</p>
<p>BOAT LIVING. See also SAILBOAT LIVING
</p>
<p>RTs are reciprocal and both are displayed. For example, at CONCERTS an
RT reference leads to MUSIC FESTIVALS; at MUSIC FESTIVALS an RT ref-
erence leads to CONCERTS. Each refers to the other. They look like this:
</p>
<p>CONCERTS. See also MUSIC FESTIVALS
</p>
<p>MUSIC FESTIVALS. See also CONCERTS
</p>
<p>RT references assume that someone interested in items about concerts is likely to
be interested also in items about music festivals, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>Cross-references can appear on computer screens if the library has an
OPAC, or on cards, if the library has a card catalog. Catalog format does not
affect the display of cross-references.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Subdivisions in LCSH
</p>
<p>LCSH is full of subdivisions. One level of subdivision is sufficient to repre-
sent most topics in detail, but some headings require two, three, or even four sub-
division levels.
</p>
<p>Subdivisions are listed following the cross-references for a heading, each
with the scope notes, classification numbers, and cross-references that pertain to
that particular subdivision. Each subdivision is indented and printed with a long
dash preceding it to indicate that it is not to be used alone, but only as a subdivi-
sion of the heading under which it appears. Subdivisions of a subdivision, neces-
sary for very large topics that have several kinds of subdivisions (e.g., topical,
chronological, and geographic) are indented further and are given additional
dashes, depending on their level in the hierarchy. For example, a topic such as
the history of Chinese calligraphy in the twentieth century would be expressed
by the LCSH heading CALLIGRAPHY, CHINESE&mdash;HISTORY&mdash;20TH
CENTURY, which is a two level hierarchy; and a topic such as the attribution
of Chinese calligraphy from the Sui dynasty would be expressed as
CALLIGRAPHY, CHINESE&mdash;HISTORY&mdash;THREE KINGDOMS-SUI DYNASTY,
220-618&mdash;ATTRIBUTION, which is a three level hierarchy. Figure 19.2, page
450, shows how these hierarchies appear in the list.
</p>
<p>Broad topics such as art, music, and science are likely to have numerous
cross-references and subdivisions, some of which have their own subdivisions as
well. This makes for confusion in locating a particular one, because it can be
pages away from the main heading. LCSH has all these subdivisions because it is
used to organize large files for topics about which much has been and still is be-
ing written.
</p>
<p>Three types of subdivisions predominate in LCSH: topical, chronological,
and geographical. A fourth variety, form subdivision, also is present in the list,
but these terms can be construed as a special type of topical subdivision. Subdi-
visions are indicated in the list in several ways, so catalogers must be alert to all
the possibilities. Individual subdivisions should be assigned according to LC
policies, given in Subject Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings. In particular,
beginning catalogers should be aware that two main headings cannot be com-
bined in a heading-subdivision relationship, unless one is listed specifically as a
subdivision under the other, or unless one heading functions both as a main head-
ing and a subdivision and is permitted as a subdivision under the second heading.
The cataloger should avoid assuming that the absence of an instruction not to
subdivide is permission to go ahead. Quite the contrary&mdash;if there is no clear indi-
cation of permission to subdivide a heading, it should not be subdivided. An im-
portant exception to the rule is the group of pattern headings listed in the preface
to LCSH, discussed below.8
</p>
<p>LCSH headings can be subdivided four ways: (1) The subdivision may ap-
pear in the list under the heading, (2) an instruction to subdivide may be given
with the heading in the list, (3) the heading may be one of the designated pattern
headings to which subdivisions may be added, and (4) the heading may be a term
to which particular free-floating subdivisions can be added.

<p>Figure 19.2. Hierarchy of subject headings.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The easiest and most straightforward method of providing for subdivisions
is listing them under the headings to which they can be assigned, but doing so for
all possible subdivisions would cause LCSH to expand far beyond its current
size. Thus, although this method is used, alternatives also are employed for rea-
sons of economy and flexibility.
</p>
<p>Geographic Subdivision Instructions
</p>
<p>The fact that a heading can be subdivided geographically usually is noted
by the parenthetic instruction (May Subd Geog) after a primary heading or after a
subdivision. The preferred method of subdividing geographically is to put the
name of a country after the heading being subdivided. Geographic entities larger
than countries, such as continents or other multicountry regions, may be given
the same way, but entities wholly within a country are preceded by the name of
the country in which they are located. This practice is called indirect geographic
subdivision. For example, headings and their geographic subdivisions assigned
to books about agriculture in North and South America, the Amazon Region, the
Andes Mountains, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, the Andes mountains of Vene-
zuela, and the cities of Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro would create the follow-
ing file:
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;AMAZON RIVER REGION
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;ANDES REGION
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;ARGENTINA
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;ARGENTINA&mdash;BUENOS AIRES
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;BRAZIL
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;BRAZIL&mdash;RIO DE JANEIRO
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;ECUADOR
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;NORTH AMERICA
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;SOUTH AMERICA
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;VENEZUELA&mdash;ANDES REGION (VENEZUELA)
</p>
<p>The resulting file intermingles geographic entities at different hierarchical
levels by interfiling countries and continents with regions that span more than
one country, but it places cities and localities within the files for their countries.
This makes it possible to search localities either by browsing their country files
or by requesting the desired locality in a keyword search.9
</p>
<p>Three countries&mdash;the United States, Canada, and Great Britain&mdash;have spe-
cial rules for indirect subdivision. (Although United Kingdom is the proper name
of the country and should be used in place of Great Britain, LCSH uses Great
Britain because of the difficulty of making the change.) For them, the names of
states, provinces, and constituent countries, respectively, are used. Thus, materials
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) 451</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>on agriculture in Iowa City, education in London, and advertising in Toronto are
assigned the following subject descriptors:
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE&mdash;IOWA&mdash;IOWA CITY
not AGRICULTURE&mdash;UNITED STATES&mdash;IOWA CITY
</p>
<p>EDUCATION&mdash;ENGLAND&mdash;LONDON
not EDUCATION&mdash;GREAT BRITAIN&mdash;LONDON
</p>
<p>ADVERTISING&mdash;ONTARIO&mdash;TORONTO
not ADVERTISING&mdash;CANADA&mdash;TORONTO
</p>
<p>Policies for geographic subdivision have changed over the years, some-
times favoring direct subdivision, sometimes indirect, and sometimes accepting
both depending on the country. The current policy favoring indirect subdivision
results in a file gathered first at the country level, then at the local level. Even the
three exceptions gather records first at the state, province, or constituent country
level before grouping them at the local level. Because much geographically dis-
tinctive material in libraries is about these countries, this strategy avoids gather-
ing them at the country level, preferring the state or province level instead.
</p>
<p>Current LC policy is to subdivide indirectly, but older headings that were
subdivided directly remain. LCSH is not governed solely by one policy but is an
amalgam of many policies implemented throughout its existence. New direct
geographic subdivisions will not be established under the current policy.
</p>
<p>Other Subdivision Instructions
</p>
<p>Instructions to use a particular nongeographic heading as a subdivision
under other descriptors may be given with the heading in the list; for example,
under BASEBALL, it says: &ldquo;SA subdivision Baseball under names of individual
schools, e.g., Harvard University&mdash;Baseball."10
</p>
<p>Pattern Headings
</p>
<p>LCSH&rsquo;s creators identify twenty-three groups of headings as pattern head-
ings. Each member of a pattern heading group can be expected to need the same
set of subdivisions; but instead of repeating the whole set under each, one head-
ing is fully subdivided in the list and catalogers are instructed to use this pattern
for all the others. For example, all plants and crops can be subdivided with the
same terms as those given under CORN and all sacred works can be subdivided
exactly like BIBLE. Some heading groups are provided with more than one pat-
tern; for example, subdivision of diseases may follow the pattern under
CANCER or the one under TUBERCULOSIS. Pattern headings are listed in
LCSH.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Free-Floating Subdivisions
</p>
<p>Some subdivisions&mdash;all topical terms, including many representing literary
forms&mdash;are designated as free-floating. Some have such widespread potential
for use as subdivisions that it is difficult to anticipate and list them all. Instead,
they can be assigned under a broad range of headings. Specific guidance on how
to assign free-floating subdivision terms is given in Subject Cataloging Manual:
Subject Headings.
</p>
<p>Form Subdivisions
</p>
<p>Form subdivisions, mentioned previously in connection with the list of
free-floating terms, include terms that describe the format in which a work ap-
pears, such as &mdash;CATALOGS. This group of terms also includes literary genres,
such as &mdash;DICTIONARIES and &mdash;BIOGRAPHIES. Most form subdivisions are
free-floating.
</p>
<p>Chronological Subdivisions
</p>
<p>Chronological subdivisions, most of which are not free-floating, are almost
always given in the list of terms for those subject headings and subdivisions that
may be subdivided by period. History is frequently subdivided by time period,
and historical topics often are specific to particular places. The introductory ex-
planations warn catalogers not to use the historical periods developed for one
place under other places. This is to be expected because each country, state, or
province will have its own chronological landmarks. Chronological periods that
can apply to many topics, such as the names of the centuries, e.g., &mdash;EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY, appear both as primary headings and as subdivisions under other
headings.
</p>
<p>Topical Subdivisions
</p>
<p>Topical subdivision is exactly what the name implies: a subdivision repre-
senting a topic,such as BUILDINGS&mdash;MAINTENANCE. MAINTENANCE,
the subdivision, does not represent a geographical, chronological, or form sub-
division. It is a topical subdivision, but it cannot be used just anywhere, as the
free-floating subdivisions can. If it was not given in the list under BUILDINGS,
catalogers cannot &ldquo;make it up.&rdquo; They have to use BUILDINGS alone or use two
headings to embody the concept.
</p>
<p>Because subdivision is done only as LC directs, uniform strings of head-
ings and subdivisions are created that can be combined in only one way.
ARCHITECTURE&mdash;ARID REGIONS and ARID REGIONS&mdash;ARCHITECTURE
mean the same thing, but LCSH only permits the former. Catalogers examining
both terms will find &mdash;ARID REGIONS listed as a subdivision under
ARCHITECTURE, but no listing for &mdash;ARCHITECTURE as a subdivision under
ARID REGIONS. This happens because LCSH is precoordinated.

<p>LCSH&rsquo;s Canadian Complement
</p>
<p>Canadian Subject Headings, third edition (CSH3) is a one-volume work
with 550 pages containing about 6,000 headings and many supporting refer-
ences.11 It is neither a comprehensive list nor a substitute for LCSH. It is to be
used for items containing Canadian subject matter; whereas LCSH is to be ap-
plied to all other materials. CSH3&rsquo;s headings and references expand and adapt
LCSH where Canadian topics are not adequately covered or where LCSH head-
ings are not acceptable in a Canadian context. The differences in the
sociopolitical structure between Canada and the United States is an obvious area
where subject headings suitable to a Canadian topic are needed, for example,
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX&mdash;CANADA. Figures 19.3 and 19.4 both illus-
trate the application of CSH3. Although the subject headings in Figure 19.3
could be built from LCSH, it is easier to use CSH3, where they are found fully
constructed. Furthermore, for works dealing with specific aspects of prime min-
isters&rsquo; activities, CSH3 provides many more subdivisions for prime ministers
than LCSH does and, therefore, a greater depth of analysis in this subject area.
Figure 19.4 is an example of the difference in approach and terminology be-
tween CSH and LCSH.
</p>
<p>CSH3 provides more user guidance in its text than does LCSH (which has a
separate manual), with fifty-three preliminary pages of introductory explanation
and many more scope notes. The headings conform to LCSH patterns and direc-
tives, but the cross-reference structure (x = see from, xx = see also from, sa = see
also) once also used by LC has been retained. CSH3 is available free of charge on
NLC&rsquo;s Web site (www.nlc-bnc.ca/cshweb/index-e.htm). CSH on the Web is up-
dated monthly and provides full authority records displayed in both MARC 21
and thesaurus formats. Subject authority records for Canadian Subject Headings
also are available on AMICUS, NLC&rsquo;s bibliographic and authorities database, a
free service, available at www.nlc-bnc.ca/cshweb/index-e.htm.
</p>
<p>Although the subject heading list itself is composed of English-language
terminology, the introduction to CSH3 is in English and French, and there are
four indexes: English to French and French to English for both the main headings
and subdivisions. The indexes link CSH3 to French-language headings found in
R&eacute;pertoire de vedettes-mati&egrave;re.12
</p>
<p>NLC has been contributing new subject concepts identified in Canadian
publications to LCSH since 1994. LC also uses CSH3 as a basic source when
considering new headings.

<p>Problems with LCSH
</p>
<p>Until recently, LCSH evolved very slowly, and critics claimed that the Li-
brary of Congress resisted needed changes in spelling and terminology. In the-
ory, LCSH is constantly under revision, with catalogers able to propose new or
altered headings at any time. A slow pace of change in any list this large is under-
standable. LC has a great many more items cataloged under any one heading
than smaller libraries do; therefore, the number of operations needed to update
LC records whenever there is a change to an existing heading is considerable,
running into the tens or hundreds of thousands for some headings used also as
subdivisions. Thus, subject catalogers at LC resisted for many years changing
the now-obsolete heading NEGROES to AFRO-AMERICANS and BLACKS
(the former referring to black people in the United States and the latter to black
people outside the United States), even though they acknowledged that the word
Negroes had negative connotations. (Canadian Subject Headings does not have
a heading for &ldquo;Afro-Canadians,&rdquo; using instead BLACK CANADIANS.) Simi-
larly, LC resisted changing MOVING PICTURES to MOTION PICTURES
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) 457</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>until 1989, which necessitated the change of many derivative headings. In the
1990s, however, the transfer of LC&rsquo;s catalog records and authority files to an on-
line file was completed and speeded up the process of change. New printed edi-
tions appear every year, and greater flexibility in revising old headings and
introducing new ones is an encouraging trend.
</p>
<p>Selected problems of LCSH have been or are being addressed by the Sub-
ject Analysis Committee, a standing committee of the Cataloging and Classifica-
tion Section of the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services. It
appoints and maintains many subcommittees and task forces, each devoted to a
particular problem or issue. Members are appointed on the basis of their interest
and expertise, and their reports often are instrumental in adding new headings to
LCSH, changing older ones, or modifying its application policies. A subcommit-
tee of the Subject Analysis Committee succeeded in ridding the list of sexist
headings that intimated it was unusual for women to be doctors, authors, or other
kinds of professionals. The offensive &ldquo;WOMEN AS&rdquo; headings were deleted
from the list and, instead, headings for such topics are constructed on the model
WOMEN AUTHORS, WOMEN PHYSICIANS, and so forth. The subcommit-
tee prepared a list of nonsexist subject headings demonstrating how to represent
topics without prejudice.13 Since then, other nonsexist thesauri have been pub-
lished.14 Catalogers sensitive to gender issues also saw the presence of heading
pairs that singled out only the female sex (such as &ldquo;authors&rdquo; and &ldquo;women au-
thors&rdquo;) as unequal treatment of women in subject headings. They lobbied to have
gender-specific headings for both sexes, and LC has complied; for example,
LCSH now has MALE AUTHORS and WOMEN AUTHORS.
</p>
<p>Other groups also have lobbied LC successfully to create needed headings
(e.g., the Music Library Association) or, alternatively, created their own thesauri
to augment or supplement LCSH (e.g., the film archivists who jointly sponsored
the publication of Moving Image Materials: Genre Terms). These terms also
have been accommodated by special fields in LC&rsquo;s computer encoding system.
</p>
<p>The National Library of Canada presents changes proposed for CSH3 to the
Canadian Committee on Cataloguing for discussion. From time to time, the Na-
tional Library forms ad hoc committees with membership drawn from the cata-
loging community to advise on special aspects of subject analysis.
</p>
<p>LCSH has informative scope notes and instructions for the application of
some of its descriptors, but there are not nearly enough of them. With so many
headings appearing over such a long period of time, overlaps are inevitable,
e.g., CONFORMITY and COMPLIANCE; COMPUTERS, ELECTRONIC
DIGITAL COMPUTERS, MINICOMPUTERS, and MICROCOMPUTERS
(but no heading appears for &ldquo;mainframes,&rdquo; not even as a cross-reference). The
distinctions LC makes between similar headings can easily be missed by search-
ers unfamiliar with the terminology; for example, AFRO-AMERICANS and
BLACKS differ only in whether the specified people live within or outside of the
United States. Subject cataloging specialists who work with LCSH are aware of
the distinction, but users searching the catalog often are not.

<p>LC&rsquo;s Annotated Card Program
</p>
<p>In 1965, LC responded to an expressed need on the part of librarians work-
ing with children and youth for modifications in subject headings for children&rsquo;s
materials by initiating its &ldquo;Annotated Card&rdquo; (AC) program. Four modifications
were made to the materials treated under the program: (1) subdivisions referring
to age level, such as &mdash;JUVENILE LITERATURE, were dropped; (2) selected
terms were added, revised, or simplified; (3) subdivision practice was altered;
and (4) summaries were added in the descriptive cataloging to inform searchers
about the content of the materials (hence the term &ldquo;annotated&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Examples of AC headings that differ slightly from LCSH are ALPINE
ANIMALS, used instead of LCSH&rsquo;s ALPINE FAUNA, and BEDWETTING, used
instead of LCSH&rsquo;s ENURESIS. Clearly, &ldquo;animals&rdquo; and &ldquo;bedwetting&rdquo; are recog-
nized and understood by youngsters more easily than &ldquo;fauna&rdquo; and &ldquo;enuresis,&rdquo; re-
spectively. In other instances, the modification is subtler; for example, ROBOTS is
used in the AC program for materials about androids as well as other kinds of robots,
while ANDROIDS is used for adult materials specifically about that type of robot.
Two important modifications in subdivision practice are the use of &mdash;BIOGRAPHY
for individual biographies in subject fields where LCSH lacks terms for persons
in the field, and &mdash;FICTION, which can be added to all topical headings.
</p>
<p>The list of Annotated Card Program headings (or &ldquo;AC&rdquo; headings) immedi-
ately precedes the regular list of headings, and is similar to the regular list, three
columns to a page, with scope notes, cross-references, subdivisions, but no clas-
sification numbers. AC headings are assigned in addition to LCSH headings.
They appear in square brackets following the regular LCSH headings; the sum-
maries appear in the note area of the descriptive cataloging.

<p>Sears List of Subject Headings (Sears) was initiated by its original compiler,
Minnie Earl Sears, in response to requests from librarians for subject headings that
were simpler to understand and use than those in LCSH. Publisher H. W. Wilson
adopted Sears subject headings on the catalog cards it produced for its commercial
card distribution service, which catered mainly to small public and school libraries.
</p>
<p>Sears recognized the value of maintaining a uniform structure between
LCSH and her list. It was convenient and made it possible to coordinate terms
from both lists. If a cataloger wanted to use a heading that Sears did not have but
LCSH did, the heading could be added without fear of conflicting with the struc-
ture of existing headings. If a small library grew large enough that Sears head-
ings were no longer effective, it could &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; to LCSH. The LCSH structure
was not unacceptable by itself, but the terms chosen for the headings were some-
times too technical for unsophisticated searchers, and the breakdown of subjects
into categories was too specific for smaller institutions with limited collections
of materials. Sears&rsquo;s small size and simple terminology also appealed to those
who felt LCSH was difficult to learn to use. Figure 19.5 demonstrates both the
similarity between Sears and LCSH and LCSH&rsquo;s greater range of specificity.

<p>H. W. Wilson updates Sears for its customers. New editions of Sears were
issued about every five to seven years when new editions of LCSH were appear-
ing only about once a decade. This changed in 1988, when LCSH began issuing
new editions annually. The most recent edition of Sears followed its predecessor
by just three years. At this writing, Sears is in its seventeenth edition.15 Joseph
Miller, its current editor, is only the fifth in the series of editors who followed
Sears. Sears List of Subject Headings: Canadian Companion (SearsCC), which
provides headings for items containing Canadian subject matter, is in its sixth
edition. Lynne Lighthall is its editor.16
</p>
<p>Sears is contained in one volume of nearly 800 pages. The headings are
listed in two columns to a page; thus the list contains between 15,000 and 16,000
authorized subject headings and cross-references. The book has an extensive in-
troductory chapter giving Sears&rsquo;s history, the principles on which the list is
based, instructions for applying it, and a bibliography of basic sources for more
information. A list of headings from the previous edition that have been changed
immediately precedes the first page of subject headings. Some changes are mi-
nor, such as the replacement of ART FORGERIES with ART&mdash;FORGERIES;
others are more far-reaching, such as the replacement of BUYING with
PURCHASING. The former change involved only adding a dash between the
two parts of the term which, although primarily cosmetic, also changes the way
the term is filed. The latter change alters the word used for the concept and
shifts the file for it from the &ldquo;Bs&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Ps.&rdquo; Some changes are even more exten-
sive, such as the change from GRANDPARENT AND CHILD to
GRANDPARENT-GRANDCHILD RELATIONSHIP. The list of changed
headings expedites identifying the revisions that should be made in the catalog
when adopting the new edition. Changed headings also are identified in the list
as &ldquo;Former headings.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Authorized headings are always printed in boldface type, whether they
are found in the main filing order or as cross-references under other headings.
Roman print is used for terms unauthorized for use as headings but used as
cross-references. For example, CARNIVOROUS PLANTS appears in boldface
print as a main heading in the &ldquo;Cs&rdquo;, while INSECT-EATING PLANTS appears
in roman print under it. In the &ldquo;I&rdquo;s, INSECT-EATING PLANTS appears in
roman print as a main heading with the cross-reference &ldquo;USE CARNIVOROUS
PLANTS&rdquo; following it in boldface.
</p>
<p>In addition to the subject headings and cross-references, many of the head-
ings have suggested classification numbers, taken from the thirteenth edition of
Abridged Dewey Decimal Classification and Relative Index (DDC-Abridged).17
</p>
<p>When a subject has more than one viewpoint, more than one classification num-
ber may be suggested for a particular topic, depending on which one is repre-
sented in an item.18 For example, COMPUTER BULLETIN BOARDS is
followed by two numbers, 004.693 and 384.3, depending on whether the focus is
computer science or commerce. The editor explains that Dewey numbers are not
assigned to very general topics and are deliberately kept short, but can be ex-
tended if desired by the addition of subdivision numbers in DDC tables.19
</p>
<p>Some headings are followed by instructions on how to apply or subdivide
them. For instance, under the heading MAGNET SCHOOLS, the instruction
</p>
<p>Sears List of Subject Headings 461</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>states: &ldquo;Use for materials on schools offering special courses not available in the
regular school curriculum and designed to attract students without reference to
the usual attendance zone rules, often as an aid to voluntary school desegrega-
tion&rdquo;;20 and under DIRECTORIES, the instruction states: &ldquo;Use for materials
about directories and for bibliographies of directories. S[ee]A[lso] subjects and
names of countries, cities, etc., with the subdivision Directories, for lists of per-
sons, organizations, objects, etc., together with addresses or other identifying
data [to be added as needed].&rdquo;21 The instructions may include information about
when not to use a heading and furnish alternatives for similar works with differ-
ent emphases. For example, under DINNERS, the instruction states: &ldquo;Use for
materials on menus and recipes for dinners. Materials on dining customs and
gastronomic travel are entered under Dining.&rdquo;22
</p>
<p>Sears does not list personal names and other proper nouns or the names of
particular animals, plants, or diseases, and so forth that would be difficult to an-
ticipate and add to the list. An example of such an addition is the heading shown
in Figure 19.6, below and page 463. Instructions allow catalogers to add these
headings as needed.23

<p>The headings in Sears are arranged according to a 1980 edition of filing
rules sponsored by the American Library Association.24 These rules, based on
the principle of filing subject headings as they appear and without taking account
of punctuation, were simplified from a more complicated version published ear-
lier, and they facilitate automated filing in computerized catalogs. Subject head-
ings are now filed word by word with digits preceding letters, and punctuation is
ignored. Figure 19.7, shows a list of hypothetical subject headings filed by these
rules.
</p>
<p>Inverted terms requiring commas, such as CHILDREN, VAGRANT, have
been eliminated from Sears, as the editor says, &ldquo;on the theory that most library us-
ers search for multiple-word terms in the order in which they occur naturally in the
language.&rdquo;25 Ignoring punctuation in filing disperses some headings more closely
related to one another than to those filed next to them; however, it is a boon to
patrons who do not know different types of punctuation have special meanings.
</p>
<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>Despite its problems and idiosyncrasies, LCSH remains the subject head-
ing list in widest use among U.S. and Canadian libraries. In small libraries and
media centers, Sears often is used. However, network records almost always
contain LCSH subject headings. The need to exploit the power of cataloging net-
works is causing many librarians and media specialists to rethink their adherence
to systems that are little used in computerized databases.

<p>There is no requirement that narrow headings be used when broader ones
will do an acceptable job. If a library has only a few books on a subject, a cata-
loger could decide not to distinguish them and put them all under one broad
heading. These decisions should be based on a clear idea of how the collection
will grow in the future. If a library has small collections that are unlikely to grow
much larger, Sears headings might be applied instead of LCSH, because they are
broader.
</p>
<p>Subject headings must bring together enough material so that someone
looking under a particular heading will find all the materials relevant to that topic
collocated there. At the same time, they must not bring together too many items,
or the file will be rendered useless to all but the most persistent searchers. If an
agency uses a cataloging network as its source for cataloging data, decisions also
must weigh the cost of changing headings on derived cataloging against putting
up with more or less collocation than would be optimal. Maintaining a local sub-
ject authority file that describes the library&rsquo;s unique practices has its costs.
</p>
<p>The delicate balance between gathering and distinguishing materials by
subject shifts according to the needs of individual groups of materials and indi-
vidual searchers. The best the cataloger can do is to try to please most of the
searchers most of the time, while working toward an ideal subject catalog in
which all users find exactly what they need under whatever headings they choose
to use.

</p>
<p>In this chapter the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Library of
Congress Classification (LCC) are described. Both are widely used by libraries
in the United States and Canada to shelve books and other materials in an orga-
nized manner. Classification numbers are the element in shelf addresses (or call
numbers) that reflects the subject content of the materials. By assigning similar
classification numbers to material on similar topics, browsers find them gathered
together for easy access.
</p>
<p>'���)�'���+���������*���
�&amp;�
</p>
<p>The DDC is a universal, enumerative, hierarchical classification system. It
employs the system of decimal division; that is, all knowledge is divided into ten
main classes, each of which is subsequently subdivided into ten more subclasses
and so on, theoretically, ad infinitum. Forest Press, its publisher, claims it is the
most popular classification system in the world.1 The DDC is used widely in the
United States and Canada and more than 100 other countries. The National Li-
brary of Canada uses DDC to classify its collection, and it is the basis for ar-
rangement of the British National Bibliography and other national bibliographic
agencies in the Commonwealth and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Principles Underlying DDC
</p>
<p>Seven principles underlie the organization and structure of DDC:

<p>1. Decimal division. This is the primary method of division used by
DDC. It merits notice because it is a familiar and useful method of di-
viding&mdash;division by tens is something most people think of as
&ldquo;round&rdquo; numbers&mdash;and because it is at the root of some of DDC&rsquo;s
most troubling limitations.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. Classification by discipline. The primary attribute applied in dividing
knowledge is discipline, represented by the ten main classes. That
may seem natural to readers of this book, because it is so familiar to
most librarians, but it is not the only possibility. Knowledge could be
divided first by a different element, such as time period or geographic
location, and only after that, by discipline, genre, or form, and other
attributes.
</p>
<p>3. Hierarchy. Although the principle of moving from the broadest cate-
gories to narrower ones and from these to still narrower ones until the
narrowest possible category is reached is encountered frequently in
classification, DDC emphasizes it and uses it obviously in complex
numbers. Ideally, the hierarchy built into DDC numbers identifies
topics at the same level and clarifies which are broader and narrower,
merely by noting the number and character of the digits in the class. In
practice, this works out only part of the time, because not all topical
areas divide neatly into ten elements. In areas such as literature, a
number with three digits (e.g., 813, American fiction) might be at the
same level as a number with five or more (e.g., Russian fiction,
891.43).
</p>
<p>4. Mnemonics. Dewey liked time-saving devices and incorporated them
into his classification. Specific groups of numbers may represent the
same topic in many places in the classification. An example is the
number &ldquo;-73,&rdquo; which stands for United States in geography (917.3),
cookery (641.5973), political parties (324.273), and so forth. How-
ever, it doesn&rsquo;t always work; for example, the number 730 does not
mean anything related to United States. It stands for sculpture.
</p>
<p>5. Literary warrant. This principle dictates that classes are created only
after materials exist that require them. The DDC purports to be a clas-
sification of all knowledge, and it does an outstanding job of includ-
ing topics. However, no classification of limited size can anticipate or
list all topics, and DDC is no exception. &ldquo;Computers&rdquo; is a good exam-
ple of a topic that was added when the need for it became clear. In the
nineteenth and earlier editions of DDC, computers occupy a tiny cate-
gory (001.64) under the larger topic of &ldquo;Research&rdquo; (001). In the twen-
tieth edition, computers expanded to occupy three newly established
sections of their own (004&ndash;006).
</p>
<p>6. Enumeration. This principle dictates the listing of potential class
numbers in contrast to the principle of faceting or synthesis, that is,
providing topical elements and allowing classifiers to put them to-
gether to build complex topics. Although this principle still generally
guides DDC, recent editions incorporate more instances of number
building because it is more economical of page space. Expansion of
many subject areas in recent years would require huge increases in
enumerated numbers to represent them, while instructions to use
existing expansion techniques without enumerating each of them do
not.
</p>
<p>470 20&mdash;Classifications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7. Relative location. At one time in the United States, Canada, and else-
where, library books were shelved in fixed locations. Once an item
was given its place on the shelves, for example, the second book on
the third shelf of the fourth stack, it would never be moved, no matter
what new materials were added to the collection. The DDC assumes
that as new books are added and shelved, existing items will be
moved to maintain their subject relationships. The DDC number
merely identifies a place relative to other items in the collection.
</p>
<p>None of these principles operates perfectly throughout DDC. They are ob-
served as far as possible when they do not conflict, create unwanted juxtaposi-
tions of subjects, or interfere with practical considerations. Enumeration is
abandoned to save space, mnemonics are superseded, and other principles may
be modified when it is important to do so. Nevertheless, the principles govern
many of the decisions made by DDC&rsquo;s editors with regard to class numbers and
relationships.
</p>
<p>An eighth principle&mdash;integrity of numbers&mdash;was promised by Melvil
Dewey to DDC users in the classification&rsquo;s early days. This meant numbers as-
signed to represent a particular topic would not be changed. Changed numbers
create a lot of work in a library trying to keep all its materials shelved in a consis-
tent, up-to-date manner. At the least, call number labels and markings in or on
materials must be changed, catalog records must be altered to display new call
numbers, and materials must be moved to their new locations. Sometimes, entire
spans of numbers were changed to reflect profound changes in a subject area,
called &ldquo;phoenixing.&rdquo; A phoenixed schedule was entirely discarded and rebuilt
(risen from its ashes, like the mythical bird). At several points in DDC&rsquo;s history,
users rebelled at having to absorb too many changes. In recent years, phoenixing
has been replaced by the milder term &ldquo;complete revision&rdquo; and the practice modi-
fied, although not entirely abandoned.
</p>
<p>Format of DDC
</p>
<p>The DDC may be purchased in book or CD-ROM form. The book version
of DDC is in four volumes totaling more than 4,000 pages. The first volume con-
tains introductory matter and seven auxiliary tables used to expand class num-
bers derived from the main schedules. Part of the introductory matter is a manual
explaining generally how to use the classification, which is augmented by a very
detailed manual in the final volume.2 The brief manual has many helpful instruc-
tions on accepted methods of building numbers using all the resources at hand:
the schedules, tables, instructions, and conventions. The schedules themselves
are contained in the second and third volumes. The Relative Index, the detailed
manual on the use of specific numbers, and the policies and procedures of LC&rsquo;s
Decimal Classification Division are found in the fourth volume. At this writing,
DDC is in its twenty-first edition.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Electronic Dewey&rdquo; or Dewey for Windows&trade; was in version 2.00 at this
writing. It contains the Schedules, Tables, Manual, and Relative Index, as well as
</p>
<p>Dewey Decimal Classification 471</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a User Guide explaining how to use program functions to assist in operations.
The software offers flexible, efficient computerized retrieval using words or
phrases, numbers, index terms, and Boolean combinations. This edition has an
automatic cuttering function. Individual libraries can annotate their discs with
local notes.
</p>
<p>The principal advantages of the electronic version over the book version,
aside from computerized retrieval, are the inclusion of frequently used LCSH
subject headings associated with a class number, taken from LC records in
OCLC&rsquo;s database; the ability to verify a classification number application by
sampling a catalog record that uses the number, also drawn from OCLC&rsquo;s data-
base; a popular, easy-to-use &ldquo;windowed&rdquo; user interface; cut-and-paste functions
that help minimize keying; and online help screens. All published updates to
DDC appear on updated CD-ROM discs, issued annually every January. Up-
dates also appear on the DDC Web site, available to any user with Internet ac-
cess.
</p>
<p>The DDC&rsquo;s Relative Index was Melvil Dewey&rsquo;s original contribution to
classification. Its great value lies in bringing together all the various aspects of a
topic under the term used to represent it, no matter where they would be classi-
fied. For example, under COMPUTER in the Relative Index the user will find
144 references to classes as far apart as musical composition employing comput-
ers (781.34) and computer science (004) or computer-assisted printing
(686.22544) and computer sorting for library catalogs (025.3177).3 Under
HEALTH are dozens of references, including health care facilities (362.1) and
their architecture (725.51), health foods (641.302), and health services in the
United States during the Civil War (973.775).4 The Relative Index does more
than just list topics in alphabetical order with their associated class numbers. It
also collocates the different contexts in which a single term might be used, or the
different classes or disciplines in which a single topic might be found.
</p>
<p>The DDC is available in an abridged edition suitable for general collections
totaling up to 20,000 volumes.5 Over the years, the abridged version has con-
tained about one-tenth as many classification numbers as the unabridged. At this
writing, the abridged version is in its thirteenth edition, published in one volume
of just over 1,000 pages. Numbers in the abridged edition, while broader in
meaning and shorter in total numbers than the full edition, are intended to be
compatible with those in the full edition.
</p>
<p>The DDC&rsquo;s main classes, based to some degree on an inversion of Sir
Francis Bacon&rsquo;s classification of knowledge, include the following:
</p>
<p>000 = Generalities 500 = Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics
</p>
<p>100 = Philosophy &amp; Psychology 600 = Technology (Applied Sciences)
</p>
<p>200 = Religion 700 = The Arts
</p>
<p>300 = Social Sciences 800 = Literature &amp; Rhetoric
</p>
<p>400 = Language 900 = Geography &amp; History
</p>
<p>472 20&mdash;Classifications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>By covering knowledge in only ten main classes, DDC forces some odd
companions into a single class. For example, in the 100s, philosophy, psychol-
ogy, and the occult are found grouped together. Statistics, etiquette, commerce,
and war share the 300s with sociology, economics, political science, law, and ed-
ucation. The 700s, primarily covering the arts, also include sports and games.
Geography and history are grouped together in the 900s in one huge main class,
even though they are quite different topics. One might expect to find library sci-
ence with the social sciences or education, but instead it is located in the 000s
(read this as zero hundreds) along with research, publishing, and other generalities.
</p>
<p>At the start of the second volume are three summaries of numbers: the ten
main classes, the one hundred divisions, and the thousand sections. (These sum-
maries are also available as a separate pamphlet.)6 This is a good place to begin
when trying to assign a Dewey number for an unfamiliar topic. The first and
most important decision made in the process (after deciding about the topic it-
self, of course) is the choice of an appropriate main class.7 It would be much eas-
ier to have only one place to put a book on computers, for example. But if the
book emphasizes the machinery, it is classified with other books on machinery,
in the 600s, applied science and technology. If it emphasizes the mathematics of
programming, it is more logically classed with other books on mathematics, in
the 500s. If it emphasizes the programs and applications, it is classed nearer to re-
search in the 000s. A video about trucks might emphasize the truck as a machine
or a type of vehicle (600s) or it might emphasize transportation via truck (300s).
</p>
<p>In some cases, a classification number will be chosen to reflect the interests
of a library&rsquo;s users. For example, the book in Figure 20.1, page 474, concerns the
Canada/United States free trade agreement. Depending on the library, either
382.971073, stressing Canada&rsquo;s agreements with the United States, or
382.973071, stressing U.S. agreements with Canada, are equally correct. In both
cases, assigning the full nine-digit number enables the classification to reflect an
item involving both countries, no matter which comes first.
</p>
<p>The DDC allows options in classification for some topics. Biography is one
of these. The DDC states that the preferred method is to place a biography with
the topic for which the person is well known. The biography of Conrad Black in
Figure 20.2, page 475, has been classified in economic production.
</p>
<p>However, DDC provides an alternate series of numbers in the 920s for li-
braries that wish to shelve all biographies together. The DDC suggests the fol-
lowing options:
</p>
<p>a) use the 920-928 schedule, e.g., 923.871 (biography of Canadian
persons in commerce, communication, transportation)
</p>
<p>b) use 92 for individual biographies
</p>
<p>c) use B (indicating Biography) for individual biographies
</p>
<p>d) use 920.71 for biographies of men, 920.72 for biographies of
women
</p>
<p>In addition, the following practice is found in many libraries:
</p>
<p>e) use 920 for collected biographies, 921 for individual biographies.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A good rule of thumb to remember about classification is that it aims to
bring related works together. To do this, a cataloger can look in the shelflist or on
the shelves to see what kinds of subjects were assigned to any particular number
under consideration. If they do not appear to be related to the work in hand, one
should look elsewhere for the classification number.
</p>
<p>Throughout the schedules, selected numbers are left blank (or &ldquo;unoccu-
pied&rdquo;) to allow for future expansion without disturbing the existing classes. In
the 000s, for example, 007-009, 024, 029, and 040-049 are unoccupied. Al-
though many areas of the 500s and 600s are very crowded, having classes with
seven or more digits, 517, 518, 524, 626, 654-656, and 699 are unoccupied. Each
of the main classes has two or more unoccupied sections; the 000s and 200s have
entire divisions that are not assigned.
</p>
<p>A Closer Look at the DDC Schedules
</p>
<p>In this section, DDC&rsquo;s main classes are explored in greater detail, noting the
subjects each typically includes; however, no attempt is made here to list all the
subjects included in the main classes. Familiarity with the schedules is best ac-
quired by using them, together with the library&rsquo;s shelflist and common sense.
</p>
<p>000s: Generalities includes works about knowledge in general; research;
communication in general; computers; controversial knowledge such as UFOs,
the Loch Ness monster, and the Bermuda Triangle; reference materials such as
bibliographies and catalogs; library and information science, including reading
in general; encyclopedias and other encyclopedic works; organizations; publish-
ing; and collections that cover many topics.
</p>
<p>100s: Philosophy, Paranormal Phenomena, and Psychology includes con-
cepts and schools of thought in detail, as well as the occult, the entire field of psy-
chology, logic, and ethics (subtitled moral philosophy).
</p>
<p>200s: Religion is one of the most straightforward classes, dealing entirely
with this one subject area. Two changes were made to the twenty-first edition in
an effort to address long-standing criticism that the great majority of numbers
represent topics in Christianity, leaving few sections for all topics relating to all
the other religions of the world. The bias is traceable to literary warrant in nine-
teenth-century U.S. college libraries, where collecting was largely confined to
books about the Christian religion, and it has persisted for more than a century.
First, the most general numbers, 201-209, which were devoted to generalities of
Christianity only, were relocated to 230-270 with other topics in Christianity.
Second, 296 and 297, covering Judaism and Islam respectively, were revised and
expanded.
</p>
<p>300s: Social Sciences, in keeping with its label, covers sociology, political
science, economics, law, public administration, and social problems. It also
includes statistics (but in this case referring to demographic statistics, not
probability theory, which is found in mathematics); military science; education;

<p>476 20&mdash;Classifications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>commerce; and an odd group of topics headed &ldquo;Customs, Etiquette, and Folk-
lore,&rdquo; under which subtopics such as marriage, death, war, holidays, chivalry,
suicide, and cannibalism are subsumed. A major revision was made in public ad-
ministration (351-354) in the 1996 twenty-first unabridged edition, followed by
a similar update in 1997 in the thirteenth abridged edition.
</p>
<p>400s: Language is a perfectly straightforward class. Language in general
(i.e., linguistics) is covered first, followed by individual languages beginning
with English and other Western European languages. Preferential positioning of
English and European languages probably is due to literary warrant and the fact
that this is an American scheme, but the schedules include an instruction ex-
plaining how classifiers can give local emphasis to any other language of their
choice.
</p>
<p>500s: Natural Sciences and Mathematics includes mathematics, astron-
omy, chemistry, physics, geology, the sciences of the ancient world, paleontol-
ogy and paleozoology, and the life sciences, first in general and then the separate
subjects of botany (called &ldquo;Plants&rdquo; in the 1996 edition) and zoology (called &ldquo;An-
imals&rdquo; in the 1996 edition). The life sciences (560-590) underwent a major revi-
sion in the 1996 unabridged and 1997 abridged editions. As mentioned
previously, computer programming is found at 519.7, immediately after proba-
bility theory and statistical mathematics. Examining the subdivisions of com-
puter programming, however, shows that materials classed here really are
concerned with the mathematical process of programming, not the applications
themselves, that is, computer programs, which are found in the 000s.
</p>
<p>600s: Technology (Applied Sciences) includes medicine, engineering, agri-
culture (both raising plant crops and animal husbandry), management, manufac-
turing, and buildings (but not architecture, which is found in the next main class,
fine arts) as well as home economics and family living. Popular topics found
here include parenting, pets, cookbooks, gardening, and automobiles. Many very
fine distinctions must be made between pure and applied sciences, necessitating
careful examination of other works in the collection to bring together related
items, for example, between botany (580) and horticulture (630), or between im-
munity in animals (591.29) and immunity in human beings (616.079).
</p>
<p>700s: The Arts, Fine and Decorative Arts, as previously mentioned, com-
bines the familiar topics of art in general, architecture, painting, sculpture, crafts,
and music, with performing and recreational arts. Thus, one finds circuses,
movies, and television at 791, titled generically &ldquo;Public performances&rdquo;; theater,
vaudeville, and ballet, called &ldquo;Stage presentations&rdquo; are at 792; and other kinds of
dancing are grouped at 793 as &ldquo;Indoor games and amusements,&rdquo; together with
puzzles, riddles, magic, and so forth. The characterization of television as a
&ldquo;public performance&rdquo; and folk dancing as an &ldquo;indoor amusement&rdquo; may be left-
over nineteenth-century perceptions. We might be more inclined to think of
television as an indoor amusement, while in some small towns folk dances
are held outdoors as public events even if they are not professional public
</p>
<p>Dewey Decimal Classification 477</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>performances. Games of skill, including computer games and chess, are classed
in 794, whereas games of chance (where some might prefer putting computer
games) are in 795. Bowling is classed as an &ldquo;indoor game of skill,&rdquo; in 794, while
baseball and football are at 796 with other &ldquo;Athletic and outdoor sports and
games.&rdquo; The distinctions are, perhaps, transparent to those who watch all three
sports and more on their television sets. &ldquo;Aquatic and air sports&rdquo; are at 797, and
outdoor sports that bring people closer to nature&mdash;horseback riding, animal rac-
ing, hunting, and fishing&mdash;are found at 798 and 799. An interesting placement in
the 700s is photography. One might expect that photographic art and techniques
would be found under different main classes, in much the same way computer
software and hardware are separated, but the entire section 770-779 is devoted to
the art of photography, its techniques, and its processes. Specialists who see film
and television art as a subset of photographic arts in general might be critical of
the separation of these topics. The music schedule (780-789), although it resem-
bles all the other schedules in outward appearance, was revised completely in the
twentieth edition, and is, in actuality, a faceted scheme based on the British Clas-
sification for Music.
</p>
<p>800s: Literature (Belle-Lettres) and Rhetoric in general is followed in this
class by the individual literature of different countries, beginning, as one might
expect, with American literature in English. An instruction here similar to the
one for languages enables a different national/language&rsquo;s literature to be as-
signed the preferential position, if desired. English and Anglo-Saxon literature is
followed by European literature, including Latin and Greek, both ancient and
modern, consuming all but the final ten sections, 890-899. Into these last few
numbers are squeezed all of Asian, Middle Eastern, and African literature as well
as Russian, Polish, and other languages less familiar to North Americans. Shake-
speare is the only author with his own number, 822.33. The citation order in the
800s is strictly observed: country/language first, followed by genre and chrono-
logical period, but only the most popular literatures have defined periods. Three
tables for literature (see A Closer Look at DDC&rsquo;s Tables section in this chapter)
augment what can be represented.
</p>
<p>900s: Geography, History,, and Auxiliary Disciplines, the final class, be-
gins with three divisions for general works on both geography and history
(900-909), general works on geography alone, including travel books (910-919),
and biography (920-929). Regarding biography, however, application policies
given in the manual and used at LC&rsquo;s Decimal Classification Office recommend
using the 920s solely for collective biographies, and classing the life stories of
individuals in the subjects with which each is associated. Thus, biographies of
mathematicians Gauss and Lobachevski, who pioneered non-Euclidian geome-
try, would be in 516.9 with that subject, and a biography of Sigmund Freud
would be in 150, with other works on psychology. The other seven divisions
(930-999) are devoted to history alone, beginning with a division for the ancient
world and followed by one each for the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, North
America, and South America. All other countries and regions are grouped into
the final division, including the final section, 999, for extraterrestrial worlds.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Closer Look at the DDC Tables
</p>
<p>Because many instructions require use of the tables, a closer look at them
may be helpful. Each number in the tables is preceded by a dash to show that it
may not be used alone, but must be attached to a number from the schedules.
</p>
<p>Table 1: &ldquo;Standard Subdivisions&rdquo; is the table most frequently used, because
applying it does not require an explicit instruction in the schedules. There are fre-
quent instructions in the schedules, however, to apply the standard subdivisions
in special ways. These instructions must be heeded and supersede the unfettered
application of numbers from Table 1. The entire list is preceded by a table of pre-
cedence directing classifiers how to handle items having several applicable sub-
divisions.
</p>
<p>The DDC&rsquo;s mnemonics are recognizable to a great degree in the standard
subdivisions. The philosophy of a subject is designated -01, just as the 100s rep-
resent that field; -06 standard for organizations and management, just as the 650s
stand for management; -09 stands for historical and geographic treatment, just as
the 900s stand for those fields. The analogies are not complete, however; -05
stands for serial publications, not scientific aspects, -08 stands for history and de-
scription of a subject among groups of persons, not literary treatments, and so
forth.
</p>
<p>Table 2: &ldquo;Geographic Areas, Historical Periods, Persons&rdquo; and all other tables
that follow may only be used when an explicit instruction in the schedules directs
classifiers to do so. Table 2 gives numbers for geographic areas, beginning with
general areas such as frigid zones at -11 (-113 if they are north of the equator and
-116 if they are south of it), or land and land forms at -14. Locations in the an-
cient world are identified by -3 in this table, while those in the modern world are
assigned numbers between -4 and -9. Some locales, particularly in the United
States, have their own specific numbers; for example, the borough of Manhattan
in New York City is -7471. Other much larger areas do not. The entire continent
of Antarctica is represented by -989 and the whole universe of worlds outside of
Earth has just one class, -99. Table 2 has another major use. When standard sub-
division -09 is added to a number to show that a topic is limited to a particular
place, the cataloger is instructed to go to Table 2 for a number to represent the
area, and add it to the -09. For example, if an item is about forest lands in France,
the number is 333.75&rsquo;09&rsquo;44. (The meaning of the prime marks appearing after
the 5 and 9 in this number is explained below.) The first five digits represent for-
est lands in general, and the addition of -09 from Table 1 represents geographical
treatment, and, following the instruction there, the addition of -44 from Table 2
represents France. Major changes to this table in the twenty-first edition and sub-
sequent updates, some available at the DDC Web site or on Dewey for Win-
dows&trade;, address the breakup of the Soviet Union (-47) and other political
changes affecting jurisdictions and boundaries.8

<p>Dewey Decimal Classification 479</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Table 3: &ldquo;Subdivisions for the Arts, for Individual Literatures, for Specific
Literary Forms,&rdquo; contains numbers designed to be used with 810-890 from the
main schedules, namely, the numbers for various individual literatures. Table 3
is made up of three subordinate tables: Table 3-A, &ldquo;Subdivisions for Works by or
about Individual Authors&rdquo;; Table 3-B, &ldquo;Subdivisions for Works by or about
More than One Author&rdquo;; and Table 3-C, &ldquo;Notation to Be Added Where In-
structed in Table 3-B, 700.4, 791.4, and 808-809.&rdquo; In Tables 3-A and 3-B, the
general categories of genre and criticism are subdivided finely for arranging very
large collections of literary materials about authors. In Table 3-C, different cate-
gories with their subdivisions are found, such as literary qualities or themes, to
be used for arranging very large collections of general literary criticism.
</p>
<p>Table 4: &ldquo;Subdivisions of Individual Languages and Language Families&rdquo;
contains numbers used, according to instructions, with numbers 420-490 from
the main schedules. Among the most frequently used numbers from this table are
-3, which represents dictionaries, and -86, which stands for readers. The num-
bers in this table do not all represent publication forms, however, but various
other characteristics of language materials; for example, -5 is &ldquo;Grammar of the
standard form of the language.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Table 5: &ldquo;Racial, Ethnic, National Groups&rdquo; contains numbers for racial,
ethnic, and national groups, organized more or less by geographic origins; for
example, -1 stands for North Americans, -2 for people of the British Isles, -3 for
Nordics, and so forth. There are some interesting divisions in this table; for ex-
ample, Modern Latins (-4) does not include Italians, Romanians, and related
groups, who have their own numbers beginning -5, or Spanish and Portuguese
peoples, whose numbers begin with -6. The -6s do, however, include all Spanish-
Americans at (-68) as well as Brazilians, subsumed under Portuguese-speaking
peoples at -69. The number for groups not previously given their own numbers,
-9, includes Semites, North Africans, Asians, Africans, and all native peoples
(this is DDC&rsquo;s terminology, not the authors&rsquo;) of America and Australia. Individ-
ual peoples within this large grouping are given their own numbers, also; for ex-
ample, Sri Lankans are at -91413 and Romany are at -91497. There is an option
in Table 5 to class a group other than North Americans at -1 if a library wishes to
give local emphasis to that group.
</p>
<p>Table 6: &ldquo;Languages&rdquo; contains numbers for languages of the world, but is
not intended to be used with the 400 class. Instead, it provides for representing
the language characteristics of materials classed in other schedules. If, for exam-
ple, one is classifying a translation of the Bible into Dutch, the notation for Dutch
language, -3931, is added to the number for the Bible, 220.5, to form the precise
class for Dutch-language Bibles, 220.53931. Here, as in the 400s, 800s, and else-
where, there is an option to class a particular language first, at -1. English (-2)
and European languages (-3 to -8) are given preference, and all the African,
Asian, and other, languages are found in -9. Table 6, similar to several of the oth-
ers, is a tiny encyclopedia of the world&rsquo;s languages, enumerated in just
twenty-five pages.

<p>Table 7: &ldquo;Groups of Persons&rdquo; identifies types of persons, with each section
of the table representing a particular characteristic such as age, sex, race, ethnic-
ity, or nationality. The category for young adults, interestingly, covers persons
from twelve to twenty years of age, not the teenage years from thirteen to nine-
teen as one might expect. Children are divided into three groupings: infants, birth
to two years of age; preschool, three to five years of age; and school ages, six to
eleven. This is a curious division, since it cuts off sixth graders from other ele-
mentary school-aged children and promotes them to young adulthood. (Because
most schools group children into grades kindergarten (K) through 4 or K through
6, or, occasionally, K through 8, but rarely K through 5, one wonders how DDC
arrived at this decision. And if age is the primary distinguishing feature, why are
the terms preschool and school children used at all?) The specificity in this table
is quite deep, with numbers assigned to subgroups such as Black Muslims at
-2977 and insurance agents at -368.
</p>
<p>New classifiers are reminded to use Tables 2 through 7 solely when instruc-
tions for a number from the main schedules tells them to do so. Only the numbers
from Table 1 (standard subdivisions) may be used without explicit directions in
the main schedules. At the same time, classifiers must be alert to instructions
limiting or changing the normal pattern for standard subdivisions. They may be
directed to use -001 to -009 in place of the usual -01 to -09; they may be in-
structed to use -03 to -09, which means the first two standard subdivisions (-01
and -02) cannot be used for the particular number or number span to which the
instruction applies. Although situations sometimes arise for which there are no
instructions in either the schedule or the manual, the editors try hard to give
needed guidance about the way table numbers should be assigned.

<p>The Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is the result of applying very
practical solutions to practical problems. When the library&rsquo;s collections were de-
stroyed by fire during the War of 1812, Thomas Jefferson sold Congress his per-
sonal library, then numbering about 7,000 volumes, as the basis for establishing
a new collection. Along with the materials came Jefferson&rsquo;s own classification
system, which remained in place until the turn of the twentieth century. Herbert
Putnam, then the new Librarian of Congress, implemented many changes at LC,
including the launching of a new classification. The choice was not an easy one.
The DDC was in its fifth edition at the time, and Cutter&rsquo;s Expansive Classifica-
tion, a popular rival, was in its sixth. However, after consideration of these and
other alternatives, Putnam and Charles Martel, LC&rsquo;s chief cataloger, decided to
devise a new and different scheme having as its primary objective solely the or-
derly arrangement of LC&rsquo;s current and future holdings. They wanted to avoid
adopting an existing scheme into which LC&rsquo;s holdings had to be fitted.
</p>
<p>One result of the main objective&mdash;organizing LC&rsquo;s holdings for effective
retrieval&mdash;was to release LC from any obligation to a higher authority, such as
the DDC&rsquo;s editors. (The Library of Congress has total control over the classifica-
tion.) Another was to permit literary warrant to govern the scheme, which
evolved into a loose federation of schedules, each fitting a particular subject area
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Classification (LCC) 481</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>according to what LC owned and expected to add in the years to come. Although
several overarching principles are found throughout LCC, each schedule is an in-
dividual entity in which the breakdown and organization of the subjects need not
relate to any other schedule. Thus, some schedules are in their fourth or fifth edi-
tions, while others may be in a third, and the most recently developed schedules
(for the law of particular countries) are still in their first editions (for example,
KDZ, KG, KH, Law of the Americas, Latin America, and the West Indies, was
first published in 1984; KE, and KJ-KKZ, Law of Europe, was first published in
1989). Toward the end of the twentieth century, LC abandoned numbered edi-
tions in favor of dated editions.
</p>
<p>The LCC is updated on a continuous basis. The latest decisions on new or
revised classification numbers are disseminated between editions through publi-
cation in Additions and Changes (A&amp;C), a quarterly newsletter from LC&rsquo;s Sub-
ject Cataloging Division; via LC&rsquo;s Web site; and in the classification&rsquo;s
computer-based version, Classification Plus. Printed cumulations of newly estab-
lished, dropped, and altered numbers are published irregularly by Gale Research.
</p>
<p>Other aids to using LCC for original classifying include LCSH (for general
guidance only; numbers listed there should never be used without consulting the
schedules themselves) and the Library of Congress Shelflist in Microform, a list-
ing of LC&rsquo;s holdings by call number, including official cutter numbers and other
shelf marks (available from University Microfilms International or the United
States Historical Documents Institute). Several indexes to the scheme as a whole
have been marketed commercially,9 but none has been kept current. The most
complete guide to LCC is Immroth&rsquo;s A Guide to the Library of Congress Classi-
fication by Lois Mai Chan.10
</p>
<p>Principles Underlying LCC
</p>
<p>Eight principles underlie the organization and structure of LCC:
</p>
<p>1. Classification by discipline. Like DDC, LCC divides knowledge first
into disciplines, but there are twenty-one rather than ten, and the con-
cept of what constitutes a &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; differs considerably from
Dewey (see Figure 20.3, page 486).
</p>
<p>2. Literary warrant. This principle, which dictates that classes be cre-
ated only when materials exist that require them, operates much more
prominently in LCC than it does in DDC. In DDC, literary warrant
acts more as a priority check, because DDC attempts to classify all
knowledge, not just the knowledge covered by existing documents.
(Even DDC does not include all potential subjects, because to do so
would require an infinite number of classes.) The LCC aims only to
classify all of LC&rsquo;s holdings, not all knowledge, as already explained.
As a result, it is relieved of the need to anticipate and accommodate
topics outside LC&rsquo;s collecting interests. The experts who devised the
original schedule created numbers for existing holdings and for those
</p>
<p>482 20&mdash;Classifications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>topical areas in which they believed publication would flourish and
LC would continue collecting.
</p>
<p>3. Geographical arrangement. In the course of legislative research, in-
quiries often involve particular places. As a result, subarrangement
by geographical location often is preferred over subarrangement by
other characteristics geared to a subject&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural&rdquo; hierarchy.
</p>
<p>4. Alphabetical arrangement. A second subarrangement technique em-
ployed by LCC is cutter numbers, which alphabetize when they are
applied. The LCC cutters many elements throughout the schedules,
including geographic names, topical terms, and personal names. Al-
though cutters are thought of as mnemonic devices, they do not assist
memory very much in LCC, because they are applied differently in
different parts of the schedules; that is, there is no guarantee the same
term will be cuttered identically if it appears in different places, or,
conversely, that the same cutter will represent the same word or name
in different places in the classification.
</p>
<p>5. Economy of notation. The LCC uses mixed notation, employing both
alphabetic and numeric characters. It can represent extremely narrow
topics with a smaller number of characters than DDC uses for topics
at the same level of specificity.
</p>
<p>6. Close classification. The LCC originated at a time when LC&rsquo;s collec-
tion contained more than 1 million books and was devised to handle
not only this many items but an ever-growing total. Thus, it assumes a
deep specificity that DDC does not, even though DDC can be ex-
tended to accommodate equally deep levels of specificity. Classifiers
are more likely to find in LCC a number that matches the topic of an
item being classified than they are if they use DDC&mdash;provided, of
course, that LC collects in this subject area.
</p>
<p>7. Enumeration. Similar to DDC, LCC enumerates a very large propor-
tion of the classes it provides and minimizes the use of number-building
devices that allow classifiers to synthesize their own classes. The
enormous size of LCC is evidence of its heavy reliance on enumeration.
</p>
<p>8. Relative location. Like DDC, LCC employs the principle of relative
location, although its use of geographic and alphabetic subarrange-
ments tends to fragment materials related to one another in a topical
hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Like DDC, none of LCC&rsquo;s principles operate perfectly throughout the
entire classification, but they are observed as long as they do not conflict, create
unwanted juxtapositions of subjects, or interfere with practical considerations.
Enumeration sometimes is abandoned to save space; choices between geo-
graphic, alphabetic, and topical subarrangements may be forced; and other
principles may be modified as LC&rsquo;s managers desire. Nevertheless, the opera-
tion of the principles can be observed throughout the schedules.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In addition to the eight principles, the following seven-point intellectual
structure devised by Charles Martel may be seen in the arrangement of materials
within classes and subclasses. However, current policies have abandoned it, so it
will not be visible in newly created numbers.
</p>
<p>1. Form. The first few numbers of classes and subclasses are allocated to
general form subdivisions, including periodicals, often linked with
society publications, yearbooks, congresses, documents, exhibitions
and museums, and directories.
</p>
<p>2. Theory and philosophy.
</p>
<p>3. History and biography.
</p>
<p>4. Treatises and general works.
</p>
<p>5. Law. Until the K classes were completed, legal materials focused on a
subject were classed with the subject; for example, building codes
were classed in TH219 with building construction, TH9500 with fire
prevention, and so forth. Since the publication of separate law classes,
these numbers have been deleted and the materials relocated within
K.
</p>
<p>6. Education. Materials dealing with study, teaching, and research on a
subject as well as textbooks on that subject are included in this section.
</p>
<p>7. Specific subjects and subdivisions. These numbers were likely to be
the bulk of the schedules. Martel&rsquo;s seven-point structure also was ap-
plied to topics at each level of hierarchy. For example, TH1 is &ldquo;Peri-
odicals and societies&rdquo; for building construction as a whole; TH1061
is &ldquo;Periodicals, societies, etc.&rdquo; for systems of building construction;
and TH2430 is &ldquo;Periodicals, societies, congresses, etc.&rdquo; for roofing.
Not every topic has a number for periodicals; for example, floors and
flooring, the topic following roofing, does not. The existence of a spe-
cial number for periodicals depended not only on the logical structure
but on the likelihood that periodicals would be developed for particu-
lar subjects and that LC would collect and classify them. Note that the
phrase used differs in each of the three instances in the example, com-
bining different types of materials.
</p>
<p>Format of LCC
</p>
<p>More than forty separate volumes of schedules make up LCC at this writ-
ing, and it is also available on the Classification Plus CD-ROM. Although each
volume represents a different subject area, some disciplines are divided among
several volumes; for example, Class P, literature, is contained in eleven volumes
plus a separate volume of tables. Each volume contains many, if not all, of the
following parts:
</p>
<p>1. Preface. Provides a brief history of the schedule and its editions.
</p>
<p>484 20&mdash;Classifications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. Synopsis. Lists the primary divisions of the class (or subclass) of the
volume.
</p>
<p>3. Outline. Summarizes the main subdivisions of the class. From time to
time, a cumulation of all of the outlines is published, which is very
helpful for both classifiers and searchers.
</p>
<p>4. Schedule. Enumerates all the numbers in the class (or subclass).
</p>
<p>5. Tables. Gives selected tables intended for use throughout the sched-
ule. The LCC has three interschedule or auxiliary tables: cutter num-
bers for countries of the world, U.S. states and Canadian provinces,
and cities. The auxiliary tables are not printed in all volumes, but ap-
pear in H, T, and Z. Other tables, such as those used with the P sched-
ules, are published separately from the schedules.
</p>
<p>6. Index. Provides access to terms used in the volume.
</p>
<p>The lack of a combined index to LCC is a serious drawback. Equally trou-
blesome for classifiers is the lack of coordination between LCSH and LCC. Ter-
minology for a topic may differ between the two tools, and the LCC numbers
provided in LCSH are not prescribed, merely suggested. Scope notes and helpful
instructions are rare in LCC schedules, although there are a few cryptic aids; for
example, at S414 (Calendars. Yearbooks. Almanacs) it says: &ldquo;Popular farmers&rsquo;
almanacs in AY, e.g. AY81.F3."11
</p>
<p>Originally, volumes of LCC were typeset, printed, and sturdily bound in
heavy-duty library bindings. Currently, computer processing of newly issued
volumes results in neat, attractive pages, although they are bound in paper cov-
ers. Libraries often rebind them to ensure they remain in good condition despite
heavy use. The CD-ROM version is more convenient to store, search, and use,
but it is costly. The CD-ROM version also is more up-to-date and does not re-
quire a shelf of supplements listing new, changed, and deleted numbers between
editions.
</p>
<p>Main Classes of LCC
</p>
<p>The main classes in LCC are designated by letters of the alphabet. De-
pending on how one counts, one or two letters may define a main class. For ex-
ample, if a cataloger takes the broad view, P stands for languages and literatures,
while PR is English literature, and PS is American and Canadian literature. The
same idea is applicable to B (Philosophy and religion), H (Social science), and K
(Law), which may be seen broadly as three individual classes or narrowly as sev-
eral classes each. The other classes all are given one letter, with the exception of
history, which encompasses four single letters (C, D, E, and F). A complete out-
line of LCC appears in Figure 20.3, page 486.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A quick perusal of the outline reveals several differences between LCC&rsquo;s
and DDC&rsquo;s overall structures. First, several subjects grouped together in DDC
are given their own schedules in LCC: agriculture and medicine are not part of
technology; education, political science, law, and military and naval science are
not part of social science; and generalities and bibliography are distinguished
into two separate classes, A and Z, respectively, that are as far apart in the alpha-
bet as possible. Second, the wide divergence between languages and literature
found in DDC is not present in LCC. Both are combined in P. Third, in LCC,
music and fine arts each has its own schedule, separated from recreation, which
is located at the end of the G schedule. Finally, history and geography, separated
into several different schedules, are located toward the beginning of the scheme,
immediately after religion, instead of at the end as they are in DDC. History and
law are among LC&rsquo;s largest groups of holdings, so it is understandable that be-
tween them these two subject areas cover fifteen of the volumes, or nearly
one-third of the scheme.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress does not use the two schedules developed by the
National Library of Canada (NLC) for materials relating to Canadian history and
literature: FC (Canadian history) and PS8000 (Canadian literature). Canadian li-
braries trying to assign more specific classification numbers to Canadian topics
may prefer to use derived records from NLC rather than LC for those subject ar-
eas. Figure 19.3 in Chapter 19 demonstrates the difference in classification
schedules for Canadian history.

<p>Subdivision in LCC
</p>
<p>The use of geographical location to subdivide a topic is frequently encoun-
tered in LCC. Geographic subdivisions may be arranged alphabetically or by
area, and the latter arrangements often give preference to the United States
and/or the countries of Europe and the Western Hemisphere. An example of this
arrangement can be found at &ldquo;Exploitation of timber trees&rdquo; (S434-534). After a
number for general works, the topic is further subdivided by country, beginning
with the United States and followed by the rest of the Americas, Europe, Africa,
Australia, New Zealand, Atlantic Islands, and, finally, Pacific Islands. Else-
where, the countries are listed in alphabetical order, as can be seen in the next
part of the schedule at &ldquo;Plant culture: study and teaching&rdquo; (SB51-52). In this
case, SB51 is used for general works and SB52 is used to further subdivide the
topic geographically with the instruction to add a cutter number &ldquo;by region or
country, A-Z.&rdquo; This means that every country is assigned a cutter number using
the initial letter of its name and one or more digits to represent a subsequent letter
or letters, thus producing an alphabetical subarrangement.
</p>
<p>Topical subdivisions under each geographic locality sometimes are repre-
sented by special number spans for different countries and sometimes by a dif-
ferent letter-and-number device resembling a cutter number. To subdivide the
topic &ldquo;Regulation, inspection, etc. of seeds&rdquo; (SB114), the cataloger uses .A1 for
the publications of societies, .A3 for general works, and .A4-Z for specific re-
gions or countries. Although the first two subdivisions resemble cutter numbers,
they do not represent words or names as ordinary cutters do. The United States
has a special cutter number under the .A4-Z portion: .U6-7, where .U6 represents
general works and .U7 is further subdivided by state, A-W. According to this in-
struction, a work about the inspection of seeds in the state of Georgia would be
SB114.U7G+. (An additional level of subdivision allows the classifier to add a
third cutter number to represent a specific locality within each state.)
</p>
<p>Topical subdivisions of a subject unrelated to geographic locations also can
be arranged alphabetically by means of the cuttering device. The S schedule is
particularly rich in lists of cuttered subtopics such as different types of crops, or-
namental plants, plant diseases, and trees. In the list of trees, some of the
cuttering goes to five digits beyond the initial letter. Topical subdivisions often
are represented by numbers in a sequence of whole numbers. For example, in the
HV schedule (Social pathology):
</p>
<p>HV6085 = general works on the language of criminals;
HV6089 = prison psychology;
HV6093 = general works on intellectual and aesthetic characteristics
</p>
<p>of criminals;
HV6097 = prison literature, wall inscriptions;
HV6098 = tattooing;
HV6099 = other forms of intellectual and aesthetic expression among
</p>
<p>criminals.
</p>
<p>Library of Congress Classification (LCC) 487</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The lack of consistent treatments for similar subarrangements makes for an
extremely complicated scheme. In addition, the lack of any major aids to its ap-
plication makes LCC difficult to implement for original classification outside
the Library of Congress. Libraries that adopt LCC do so under the impression
they will find all or nearly all of the materials they buy already classified; they
expect to do little, if any, original classification.
</p>
<p>Use of cutter numbers as part of the classification is one of the disadvan-
tages of LCC for libraries other than LC; no one but LC can assign an official
cutter number for anything&mdash;a location, a topic, or a book mark. Other libraries
must wait until LC classifies an item requiring the appropriate cutter number be-
fore it is officially established. A cataloger might encounter a book on a particu-
lar type of tree that is not in the list given under SD397. If it is to be classified, the
cataloger must guess at which numbers LC will use in the numeric portion of the
cutter, and if there is any doubt about the proper name of the tree, the initial letter
as well. (Take the following hypothetical example: Suppose a cataloger was
assigning cutters for the different types of people who receive discount fares on
public transit. Would that cataloger call student recipients &ldquo;students&rdquo; or &ldquo;educa-
tional recipients,&rdquo; or would they be identified by their grade levels, &ldquo;elementary&rdquo;
and &ldquo;secondary?&rdquo; Would older people be identified as &ldquo;seniors,&rdquo; &ldquo;aged,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;elderly&rdquo;? Would civil servants be lumped into one group or divided into
&ldquo;police,&rdquo; &ldquo;transit workers,&rdquo; &ldquo;fire fighters,&rdquo; etc.?)
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress establishes new cutter numbers after consulting its
shelflist to see what already has been assigned. In doing so, its classifiers may de-
cide that they should depart from their usual pattern, a simple formula with just a
few rules (see Figure 20.4, page 489), because of some unique problem, or be-
cause of their expectation about future assignments likely to affect few libraries
outside of LC. The first element in an LC cutter number consists of the initial let-
ter of the word to be represented, combined with one or more Arabic numerals
chosen according to the rules shown in Figure 20.4.
</p>
<p>Subject Cataloging Manual: Shelflisting and Subject Cataloging Manual:
Classification, the companion policy manuals to Subject Cataloging Manual:
Subject Headings, are helpful for local classifiers in deciding on original cut-
ters.12 Another useful tool is LC&rsquo;s shelflist, which can be purchased on micro-
fiche from University Films International.13

</p>
<p>The LCC has many more numbers and many more specific classes than
DDC in which to place very narrowly defined topics. For instance, LCC has indi-
vidual numbers for most nineteenth-century English and American authors, and
often individual numbers for each of their works. Contemporary U.S. authors are
assigned numbers according to the first letter of their surnames. The difference is
made clear by an example: In DDC, Kurt Vonnegut would join most of his con-
temporaries at 813.54 (U.S. writers of fiction working after 1945) and in LCC, he
would join only those U.S. writers working after 1961 whose surnames begin
with &ldquo;V&rdquo; at PS3572. That is a large difference in specificity. The desire for speci-
ficity is one reason large libraries such as the Boston Public Library and many
university libraries turned to LCC.
</p>
<p>Smaller libraries that made the change to LCC did so not to achieve greater
specificity but to take advantage of the much larger proportion of titles classified
in LCC than in DDC by the Library of Congress and other major originators of
cataloging copy, freeing them from having to do as much original classification.
Small or medium-sized college libraries using OCLC felt they would save a

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>great deal of time (and, therefore, money) by copying the LCC numbers found
online instead of doing original classification.
</p>
<p>Another contrast is the nature of the classification number produced by
each scheme. LCC numbers usually are shorter for topics of the same specificity,
but their combination of alphabetic characters and numbers is not necessarily
easier to remember or use. Some people may find the alphanumerics more un-
derstandable and logical, but others prefer the purely numerical system of DDC,
particularly when libraries add cutter numbers as book marks and other marks in
various alphanumerical sequences to the classification number to give each item
a unique shelf location. This can result in very complicated combinations of all
sorts of characters, including upper- and lowercase letters, whole and decimal
numbers, and punctuation. To accommodate all of this information on books
with narrow spines, libraries often break up the arrangement of the classification
number into several lines. It may be hard to tell where the class numbers end
and the book marks begin, or what follows what; for example, should
JX1977.8.C53q1984 come before or after JX1977.D5b1987? (In the Simmons
College library, it would come after.)
</p>
<p>The general use of cutter numbers in all libraries as book marks or shelf
marks becomes confusing when they also are part of the classification numbers.
It is especially confusing when an item has several cutter numbers, perhaps with
one denoting geographic location, another denoting a topic subdivision, and a
third for the shelf mark.
</p>
<p>The LCC&rsquo;s methods of subdividing are quite different from DDC&rsquo;s. One of
LCC&rsquo;s favorites, shown in the examples above, is to add cutter numbers for
subtopics or geographical subdivisions (or, sometimes, for both). The LCC also
uses numerical expansions to subdivide topics, but they are added differently.
When DDC instructs classifiers to add to a number, it means that some other
number from a table or another section of the schedule will be tacked on to a base
number from the schedules. For example, to expand the number for cooking,
641.5, to French cooking, one adds 9, representing geographic focus and 44 for
France, to obtain 641.5944. In LCC, the instruction to add a number from a table
to a base number in the schedules may mean to add the two numbers arithmeti-
cally. For example, to expand the number for classical art in countries other than
Greece and Italy (N5801-5896), one adds a number from a designated table to
the base number N5800. Using the number 13 for Canada, one adds it to 5800 to
get N5813, representing classical art in Canada. Sometimes, when whole num-
bers are lacking to subdivide a topic as desired, LCC employs decimal numbers.
In the previous example, to subdivide classical art in the United States for the
colonial period, one adds 03.5 to 5800, to arrive at N5803.5.
</p>
<p>The LCC occasionally contains instructions to subdivide (or subarrange) a
topic like some other in the schedule, but this is done far less frequently than in
DDC. Rather, LCC simply lists various subarrangements in the schedules, and
most differ from one another.
</p>
<p>The degree of browsability that results from using LCC or DDC also is an
important consideration. Because of its principle of hierarchy, DDC produces ar-
rangements that tend to be more satisfying to browse from a subject searcher&rsquo;s
point of view. Use of alphabetical instead of hierarchical subarrangements,
</p>
<p>490 20&mdash;Classifications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>which LCC does by means of cuttering, tends to scatter materials on related top-
ics and bring together topics at different levels of hierarchy. Even geographical
subarrangement may be less browseable, despite its logic, for subject searchers
who are more interested in topical issues than in locational ones.
</p>
<p>Finally, the difference in cost of the two tools is a practical matter that bears
mention. The DDC&rsquo;s four printed volumes (or the CD-ROM) are a great deal less
expensive than LCC&rsquo;s forty-plus volumes, even though individual LC schedules

<p>Many catalogers use the DDC and LCC numbers provided by LC in the CIP
information located on the verso of the title pages of books, or they find classifi-
cation numbers in computer network records, such as OCLC. If so, conventions
followed by larger institutions should be understood. For DDC numbers, the
most important of these is the method used to show where numbers have been
expanded. An apostrophe (also called a prime or hash mark) is placed at the end
of the basic number and again after each complete expansion of a number (see
Figure 20.2 for an example of a prime mark.)
</p>
<p>Some agencies using DDC prefer that numbers not become too long and in-
stitute policies to limit them. Such policies should involve the addition or omis-
sion of expansions, for example, to limit a classification number to the basic
number, or to one or more expansions beyond the basic number. They should not
dictate a stated number of digits, such as no more than four digits after the deci-
mal point, because for some numbers, the meaning of the categories that digits in
an expansion represent would be lost. For example, the correct DDC number for
slavery in ancient Athens is 306.3620385. This is a very long number that would
only be necessary if a library has (or expects to have) many items about slavery
in the ancient world in its collection. The length assigned to the number can be
limited in the following ways according to the needs of the collection:
</p>
<p>306 culture and institutions
</p>
<p>306.3 economic institutions
</p>
<p>306.36 systems of labor
</p>
<p>306.362 slavery
</p>
<p>306.36203 slavery in the ancient world
</p>
<p>306.362038 slavery in ancient Greece
</p>
<p>306.3620385 slavery in ancient Athens
</p>
<p>Some libraries, including LC, furnish more than the class number, adding
shelf marks such as cutters, call letters, and so forth, to it. When using another li-
brary&rsquo;s catalog records, shelf marks should be ignored unless it is a local policy
to follow these practices, also. If so, then the cataloger must be careful about
whose practices are followed. In some places, the initial letter of the main entry is
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copy&rdquo; Classification 491</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>used in place of a cutter number. In others, two- or three-digit cutters are used. It
might be confusing to adopt all of these practices simultaneously.
</p>
<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>The DDC is widely used all over the world. It is the basis for the Universal
Decimal Classification and some national classifications as well (for example, in
Korea and Japan). Its popularity in the United Kingdom is assured by its use in
the British National Bibliography and all the British Library&rsquo;s authoritative on-
line cataloging. Its flexibility is sufficient to serve many purposes, and its ease of
use is enhanced by the mnemonics, the Relative Index, and its easily grasped
overall logic.
</p>
<p>The LCC is widely used among academic libraries in the United States and,
because of the likelihood that LC numbers are used in bibliographic network re-
cords, by some libraries outside of the United States as well. The LCC is much
larger and more complex than DDC. Its overall arrangement of subjects is, per-
haps, more logical and better organized for contemporary use than DDC is, par-
ticularly in the fields of science and history. Using it to classify materials &ldquo;from
scratch,&rdquo; however, is difficult for librarians outside of LC, because it is con-
trolled entirely by LC and devoted to the arrangement of LC&rsquo;s own collections.
</p>
<p>The LCC requires less number building than DDC does and provides
shorter classification numbers than does DDC (although they are made up of let-
ters and numbers) for subjects of the same specificity. The LCC seems more hos-
pitable to new topics and allows for far greater subdivision of topics. In addition,
it avoids trying to force differing disciplines into a single mold and allows every
subject area to have the arrangement most &ldquo;natural&rdquo; to its literature.
</p>
<p>The bias of LCC toward the United States, its neighbors, and traditional al-
lies is, perhaps, even more pervasive than DDC&rsquo;s, but more understandable. The
LCC does not try to be a universal classification of knowledge, but only an or-
derly arrangement of LC&rsquo;s books. The difficulty of applying LCC to nonbook
materials probably is no greater than applying DDC to them. Both schemes were
developed to arrange books, not other forms of materials. In LCC&rsquo;s favor is the
fact that there are more opportunities for close classification, a useful attribute
because nonbook items often have very narrowly defined topics.
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress and other libraries using LCC are unlikely to
change to DDC. The LCC is equally unlikely to become ubiquitous in the United
States or anywhere else. Rather, the dichotomy in the classification of library
materials between DDC and LCC is likely to continue, with the choice depend-
ing on an agency&rsquo;s traditions, size, and orientation toward a particular source of
cataloging and classification data. Heightened awareness of the workings of
each system and an understanding of their differences and implications for use
are valuable both for librarians and patrons.
</p>
<p>Before going on, readers may want to try assigning DDC and/or LCC num-
bers to the examples on page 493. The answers are on page 497 at the end of this
chapter.

<p>The MARC formats are a set of markup protocols for bibliographic, author-
ity, classification, holdings, and community information data. Adding these pro-
tocols to the data puts them into a form that can be understood and used by
properly programmed computers. MARC is similar in principle to SGML,
HTML, and other markup languages used for transmitting electronic resources.
It is intended to be used for library data.
</p>
<p>The MARC formats are called communications formats, which means that
once in this form, one computer can transmit the data to another computer. The
term bibliographic data applies to all of the elements of a bibliographic record
that have been described in this book so far: descriptions, access points, subject
headings, and call numbers. Authority data covers all of the elements of an au-
thority record for names, titles, or subject descriptors, including the authorized
form of the name or topic, cross-references to other name forms or topical terms,
and references to the source material used in creating the authority record. Hold-
ings data are the specific data relating to any item in a library&rsquo;s collection, in-
cluding its copy number, cost, acquisition source, holding unit (such as a main
library or branch library) or collection within a library or information center, and
so forth. A fourth MARC format was developed for classification data and used
to automate the Library of Congress classification. The fifth format is for com-
munity information, such as local officials and agencies or lists of events.
</p>
<p>Institutions outside LC, including the National Library of Canada, were
consulted during the development of the MARC formats and still contribute to
their ongoing evolution, but they were initiated and devised primarily by LC, and
they reflect the needs of its cataloging products and processes. This chapter con-
centrates on the format for bibliographic data.

</p>
<p>The first MARC format was devised for the bibliographic data of books in
the 1960s. It went through several versions before being published as a national
standard in the 1970s by the National Information Standards Organization
(NISO). Before long, a MARC format for serials was devised, followed by
MARC formats for other types of materials for which LC produced bibliogra-
phies. After many years during which the number of separate MARC formats
continued to grow, an integrated MARC format was implemented during the
1990s in which all fields were made uniform across all the physical forms of
materials collected by libraries. All fields and codes still are not applicable to
every type of material, but if they do apply, their meanings are the same, thereby
simplifying the processes of learning and using the system of MARC protocols.
</p>
<p>Individual bibliographic networks have issued manuals containing ver-
sions of MARC intended for use by their participants. Selected fields have been
defined in unique ways by an individual network; for example, the coded version
of the basic features of a document are known in the Online Computer Library
Center (OCLC) and Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN) as fixed
fields and in MARC 21 as field 008, shown in Figures 21.2 through 21.4 (see
pages 504&ndash;6).
</p>
<p>Between 1994 and 1997, LC and NLC worked with their user communities
through their MARC committees to reconcile the differences between the offi-
cial Canadian and U.S. formats, known as CAN/MARC and USMARC, respec-
tively. The result is MARC 21. MARC 21 is not a new format; it is the new name
for the harmonized CAN/MARC and USMARC. MARC 21 consists of the five
communications formats described previously: bibliographic data; authority
data; holdings data; classification data; and community information. There also
are concise formats for each of these.
</p>
<p>Individual countries employing the MARC formats have their own official
versions, including the United Kingdom&rsquo;s UKMARC; a generalized or universal
version also exists, called UNIMARC. Minor differences appear among the ver-
sions of MARC formats, but their fundamental structure is identical and the
same principles apply to them all.1
</p>
<p>It is important to know what the MARC formats are not. They are not a set
of cataloging rules or a cataloging code. Instead, they are designed for use with
data created by applying the standard cataloging rules, subject heading systems,
and classification schemes discussed in previous chapters of this book. Some ac-
commodations are made for local data, but there are limits to how far the formats
can be stretched. For example, the bibliographic format is geared to AACR, so
the library that does not follow these rules will find itself having to create
AACR-compatible records anyway to code them successfully.
</p>
<p>The MARC formats are not computer systems, either. They are intended to
be used in computer systems as templates for database structures, but by them-
selves they are not designed as information storage and retrieval systems. Addi-
tional programming is required to utilize the MARC protocols for information
storage and retrieval systems.
</p>
<p>History and Background 499</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Although ultimate authority over the MARC 21 formats rests with LC and
NLC, other groups in the two countries play consultative roles. In the United
States, a major influence is MARBI, the Committee on Representation in Ma-
chine Readable Form of Bibliographic Information. MARBI is an interdivisional
committee of three American Library Association divisions: the Association for
Library Collections &amp; Technical Services (ALCTS), the Library and Informa-
tion Technology Association (LITA), and the Reference and User Services As-
sociation (RUSA). MARBI&rsquo;s counterpart in Canada is the Canadian Committee
on MARC (CCM), a committee with representatives from the English- and
French-speaking national library associations, the Canadian Library Association
and l&rsquo;Association pour l&rsquo;avancement des sciences et des techniques de la docu-
mentation, respectively. Major bibliographic networks, such as OCLC and
RLIN in the United States and A-G Canada (described later in this chapter), also
contribute important advice. The MARC Editorial Office at LC and MARC
Office at NLC make and publish the final decisions.
</p>
<p>The MARC formats look very complicated because they must include
everything needed to identify every detail of a record to a machine that cannot
understand any part of it by itself.
</p>
<p>���+��
��&amp;*���+�������&amp;�'
</p>
<p>Fields
</p>
<p>Computer data generally are divided into parts called fields, and each field
is further subdivided into subfields. Each catalog record (or bibliographic record,
as it is called in the computer system) is made up of fields that correspond to each
area of the catalog record (title, edition, publication information, physical de-
scription, series statement, notes, etc.). The subfields in each field, in turn, corre-
spond to particular elements of the area; for example, subfields in the physical
description field include one each for the extent, other physical details, dimen-
sions, and accompanying materials; and the subfields in the Dewey Decimal call
number field correspond to the classification number, the shelf marks, and the
edition of the classification used.
</p>
<p>Every MARC record has two kinds of information in it, contained in two
kinds of fields: fixed and variable. The kind of information discussed in the para-
graph above is variable in nature. The names of personal authors are an example.
A person&rsquo;s name may consist of a forename alone (Homer); a forename and a
surname (William Shakespeare); a forename and a compound surname (Walter
de la Mare or Sir Alec Frederick Douglas-Home); or a family name (Adams fam-
ily). Or it may be another variant, such as initials or descriptive phrases. The
name may have seven, seventeen, or twenty-seven letters. It could require the in-
clusion of numbers, frequently encountered for royalty (Elizabeth II or Louis
XVI). Titles, too, may be short or long; contain letters, numbers, and/or symbols;
and have one word or many. These data must be contained in fields that are flexi-
ble enough to admit all these possibilities. Such fields have variable lengths and
</p>
<p>500 21&mdash;The MARC Formats</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>are called, appropriately, variable fields. Variable fields contain almost all of the
data we have studied.
</p>
<p>Some information in entries does not vary but is always entered the same
way, either because the data are naturally invariant or because they are intention-
ally coded to eliminate variation. An example of naturally occurring invariable
bibliographic data is the ISBN. It always appears in the same form and sequence
(ten characters, all digits or with a final &ldquo;X&rdquo;). An example of information delib-
erately coded in an invariant form is the geographic focus of a title. Geographic
locations are reduced to seven characters representing the applicable continent,
country, and locale. These kinds of information are contained in invariable or
fixed fields.
</p>
<p>Information from the variable fields may be coded and duplicated in the
fixed fields to facilitate manipulation by the computer system. One such type
of information relates to the physical description of materials. The physical
description for nonbook materials is a good example. Each type of nonbook
medium has its own kind of physical details. Films, videos, photographs, and
electronic resources may have color or be in black and white. Sound recordings
may be stereophonic or not. Microforms may be reduced to any one of several
possible reduction ratios. In each instance, however, the number of possibilities
is limited, so it is easy to use a few letters or numbers to reduce them to a short
and invariable code and add it to the computerized record. It is useful to include
the language of the item, its country of origin, the presence or absence of multi-
ple parts, and a host of other important aspects of an item, some of which might
not be given in the eye-readable portions of catalog records. All of these data, in
fixed and unchanging form, are given in fixed fields.
</p>
<p>The order of elements in the MARC format (see Figure 21.1) is very similar
to the order of elements in a catalog record. The main exception is that the call
numbers, standard numbers, and other coded elements, called control fields, ap-
pear first. Many would be missing on catalog entries in most libraries or, on LC
printed cards, they would appear at the bottom of the card below the tracings.
They are put first in the computerized record because they generally identify the
record or item and, as such, are more efficiently utilized if they are read first;
they generally are in coded form, such as a single character or a short string of
characters in fixed order, and are not understandable until they are translated.
Therefore, it is better to have these identifying or controlling fields at the start of
the record and not in the middle, where they would interrupt the bibliographic
fields, or at the end, where a processing unit would have to scan through the first
part of the record to reach them.
</p>
<p>Elements of a MARC Record 501</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Subfields
</p>
<p>Subfields are parts of fields. The title area in a bibliographic description
generally is made up of four elements: title proper, general material designation,
other title information, and statement of responsibility. The title field corre-
sponds to the title area as a whole, and each of the four elements corresponds to a
specific subfield within the title field. The title proper subfield is the first
subfield in the title field, while the date subfield usually is the third subfield in
the publication/distribution field, following two subfields for the place and name
of the publisher and/or distributor.
</p>
<p>Content Designators
</p>
<p>Each field and subfield must be identified by a name, known as a content
designator. In the MARC format, the fields are identified by three-digit codes
called tags, and subfields are identified by a single letter, number, or, occasionally,
a symbol, all called subfield codes. Subfield codes always are preceded by a
symbol called a delimiter that identifies the next character as a subfield code. In

<p>the OCLC network, the delimiter appears as a double dagger, whereas in the A-G
Canada system it appears as a dollar sign. The function of the delimiter is the
same&mdash;to identify subfields&mdash;even when various keyboards and printers inter-
pret its symbol in different ways.
</p>
<p>The application of appropriate tags and subfield codes to cataloging data
frequently is called tagging and coding a record, or sometimes just tagging or
just coding it. All of these terms, as well as encoding a record or doing content
designation, mean the same thing: that the protocols of the MARC format are be-
ing applied to cataloging data for entry into a computer system programmed to
utilize it.
</p>
<p>Fixed fields, usually the first fields in the record, are given a tag beginning
with 0 (zero). Access points generally have tags beginning with 1 (main entries),
6 (subject descriptors), 7 (added entries), or 8 (series added entries). Title proper
added entries are the main exception here. They are identified as access points in
the 245 field by the use of a special character called an indicator, described be-
low. Fields relating to the descriptive elements have tags beginning with 2, 3, 4,
and 5. Few MARC fields beginning with 9 are defined for use.
</p>
<p>Indicators
</p>
<p>Between the tags and the start of the data in the field itself are two numeri-
cal characters known as indicators. One or both of the indicators may be defined
for a field, or neither may be defined. When only one indicator is defined it may
be in either the first or the second position. For the most part, indicators are val-
ues that instruct the computer system to treat the data within the field to which
they are assigned in particular ways, such as how to index the character string,
whether to print or not to print the data in the field on a catalog card or a screen
produced from the computerized record, or whether to create or not to create an
access point for the data in the field. In the fields in which personal or corporate
body names are entered, the indicator informs the computer of the type of name
being entered, that is, whether it is in the form of a surname followed by a fore-
name (e.g., Einstein, Albert), a forename first (e.g., Leonardo, da Vinci), or the
name of a whole family (e.g., Kennedy family). A computer system needs this
information to file these names properly in its name indexes.
</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember about indicators is that their mean-
ing differs for each field in which they are used. Originally, they were a vital ele-
ment in printing catalog cards from computerized data, and they are equally
useful to computer programmers working with online systems, who can use
them to specify desired procedures having nothing to do with cards or printing.

<p>Efforts to share the planning, development, costs, and products of computer-
ized data began in the 1960s and led to the formation of bibliographic networks,
although some groups of libraries had banded together earlier in
noncomputerized network cooperatives to share tasks among their members.
The history, background, and basic services of OCLC and RLIN, based in the
United States, and A-G Canada, based in Canada, are described in Chapter 4. In
this section, online cataloging issues are described in greater detail.
</p>
<p>An important feature common to all the bibliographic networks is their use
of the MARC format to enter and transmit their data. This acceptance of the
MARC format by the networks helped make it an international standard. On the
other hand, each network adapts MARC in ways that aid its users. Some have al-
tered the appearance and entry style of the 008 control field to make it easier to
code; for example, OCLC provides mnemonic prefixes in place of delimiters and
subfield codes. Local fields unique to a network have been defined that are not
present in the official format. Generally, however, MARC records are inter-
changeable and easily recognized.
</p>
<p>All the networks incorporate national library cataloging. The Library of
Congress&rsquo;s MARC records formed the nucleus and lion&rsquo;s share of all network
databases when they started and continued to constitute a majority of records for a
number of years. The relative balance between LC and member-contributed orig-
inal cataloging shifted during the 1980s and, since that time, the proportion of LC
and national library records has been shrinking. In the 1990s, LC began using the
original cataloging of network member libraries as the basis for its own catalog-
ing. The project proceeded smoothly, with appropriate caution and attention to
quality. This change put real meaning into the phrase &ldquo;cooperative cataloging,&rdquo;
</p>
<p>508 21&mdash;The MARC Formats</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>which formerly was defined as everybody else copying LC&rsquo;s original cataloging
(hence the phrase copy cataloging).
</p>
<p>As mentioned in Chapter 4, all network records are not alike in quality and
fullness, which has put limits on the acceptability of catalog records from librar-
ies other than the national libraries. Some libraries single out selected member
library records for more editing and revision. Others are not as concerned about
the quality of individual records as they are about getting cataloging done rap-
idly, preventing backlogs, and minimizing costs. Either way, a choice usually
must be made between maximizing the use of the network (greatest speed and
least cost) and maximizing the quality of the cataloging (greatest accuracy and
appropriateness for the individual library). Such choices never are simple and are
likely to differ from one library to another as well as from one cataloger to
another.
</p>
<p>Joining a network will not mean that original cataloging no longer has to be
done in a local library. That depends on whether the materials being acquired and
cataloged are held widely enough to be found already cataloged by one of the
network members.2 In general, the materials most likely to have cataloging
available online are English-language trade books from publishers who partici-
pate in the CIP and ISBN programs. Materials least likely to have cataloging
available online are nonbook and non-English-language items, and the publica-
tions of small presses and government agencies, especially at state, provincial, or
local levels.
</p>
<p>Similarities and differences among the networks may be seen in their data-
base design and system architecture, searching and retrieval capabilities, and the
presence (or absence) of automatic authority control and other quality control
processes.
</p>
<p>Networks are employed directly by thousands of libraries and indirectly by
many more to minimize the load of original cataloging that would otherwise bur-
den them all. For many libraries, catalog records for virtually all the materials
they purchase are available from the network, and nothing needs to be done
&ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo; For those with collections of unusual materials, catalog records
for numerous titles are not available, and original cataloging still is necessary for
those items.
</p>
<p>Maximizing use of the network keeps the amount of costly, time-consuming
original cataloging as low as possible for any individual library, but it may
involve incorporating records that contain errors or that include more or less
information than is preferred. Network records contain some proportion of sub-
ject headings and classification numbers based on standards that are not used in a
particular place. Catalogers are faced with many decisions about how best to use
the network: Should all network records be accepted, or only those from desig-
nated libraries? How much time should be spent searching for existing catalog-
ing before inputting an original record? (To minimize unwanted duplicates,
networks expect a diligent search to be done before a new record is added to the
database.) How much editing should be done to existing records to make them
acceptable?
</p>
<p>Bibliographic Networks and Online Cataloging 509</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Care must be exercised in weighing the needs of the local library against
the potential savings of using imperfect cataloging from a network database.
Cataloging that is so undesirable that it is better to have nothing at all should be
identified.
</p>
<p>Each individual library that joins a network or anticipates using one should
clarify what it wishes to accomplish and develop a policy governing the use of
network records that ensures its objectives will be met. If the idea is to save
money or speed processing, a higher level of error and some differences from
ideal cataloging will have to be borne. It would be wise to experiment using the
network to do copy cataloging (that is, using network records as the cataloging
source) with a representative sample of materials to anticipate problems before
making these decisions.
</p>
<p>In addition, benefits of joining a network other than cataloging must be
considered, such as gaining access to enormous amounts of bibliographic data
for reference and resource sharing, as well as electronic communications with
other agencies. For some, these benefits may have a higher priority than the suit-
ability of the cataloging. Networks themselves share information, and some li-
braries might find it advantageous to join more than one network.
</p>
<p>Individual libraries should understand the responsibilities they shoulder
upon joining a network. Any original cataloging contributed to the shared data-
base must be consistent with the network&rsquo;s input standards. The old adage &ldquo;gar-
bage in, garbage out&rdquo; is highly relevant here. If catalogers wish to take good
cataloging out of online systems, they must put good cataloging into them. In the
network environment, &ldquo;good&rdquo; cataloging means agreeing to follow network
standards and to minimize the types of local deviations that might save time or
effort in the local database but may not be appropriate or beneficial in a shared
system.
</p>
<p>�"++��)
</p>
<p>The MARC format and its adoption by bibliographic networks, and subse-
quent use by designers of individual library computer systems for cataloging,
circulation, acquisitions, serials control, and other technical services functions,
has created a library-wide standard for computerized bibliographic data. Criti-
cized by some as too complicated or too idiosyncratic, MARC has exhibited a re-
markable ability to change with the times and accommodate many different
kinds of data. Although newer markup systems, such as the Dublin Core, are at-
tractive because they have few rules and require very little memorizing, they
lack the sophistication and precision of MARC. At this writing, no trend toward
abandoning MARC appears to be present. Time will tell whether simpler sys-
tems can be adapted to do as good a job as MARC does of identifying and relat-
ing individual items in large databases such as OCLC&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>Bibliographic networks are transforming themselves into global informa-
tion networks, with services that go far beyond their originators&rsquo; initial vision of
shared cataloging and shared resources, with other functions based on the same
core bibliographic files thrown in for good measure. OCLC, for instance, sup-
ports reference services with bibliographic and full-text databases, multilingual

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>offerings, and collection development services derived from the purchasing
track records of its members. RLIN has wide-ranging document delivery ser-
vices and is a leader in preservation management. The dependence of individual
libraries on network services seems likely to increase, even as these nonprofit
networks compete with profit-making firms offering the same or similar types of
service. At this writing, the electronic marketplace is characterized by constant
change in almost every aspect of its existence&mdash;hardware, software, products,
services, marketing, distribution, and cost&mdash;but observers believe it will con-
tinue to grow unabated for some time to come.

broaden access to bibliographic records from North American sources, including a great
deal of data for nonbook media. On the negative side, it could hinder cooperation with
European neighbors based on compatibility with UNIMARC, which would not be possi-

<p>Responsibility must be taken for setting policies and managing the library&rsquo;s
cataloging and classification operations. In small institutions, this role may be
assumed by the same person responsible for reader&rsquo;s services, collection devel-
opment, and all other information-related operations. In larger ones, it can be as-
sumed by one person as his or her primary job or it can be handled by a group that
makes important decisions as a team. The ultimate aim is the same: to ensure that
someone sees to it that cataloging and classification operations are performed
properly, in a timely manner, and according to established policies.

</p>
<p>The title &ldquo;department head&rdquo; or &ldquo;department manager&rdquo; carries with it the
responsibility to perform a variety of tasks having less to do with cataloging and
classification than with managing the library as a whole, or, for that matter, man-
aging operations of any kind. These tasks are connected with any or all of the fol-
lowing activities:
</p>
<p>1. Staffing&mdash;recruiting personnel, training and integrating them into the
staff, supervising their work, and evaluating both the work and each
staff member&rsquo;s overall performance (such as reliability, promptness,
adaptability) for the purposes of salary determination, promotion, and
so forth.
</p>
<p>2. Budgeting&mdash;preparing budgets periodically, monitoring expendi-
tures, and supplying the library or media center director with a finan-
cial report at the end of the budget period (usually a year).
</p>
<p>3. Planning&mdash;proposing departmental goals and objectives and how de-
partmental operations should proceed; devising workflow routines
and all procedures for accomplishing the work of the department;
and, when necessary, thinking up and trying new methods for getting
the work done.
</p>
<p>513
</p>
<p>��</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4. Decision making&mdash;taking the risk of choosing among alternative
goals and objectives, potential plans or proposals, policies, strategies,
procedures, suppliers, staff members and staff assignments, budgets,
and so forth for the department, and ensuring that all decisions made
are consistent with the policies set by those who govern the media
center or library.
</p>
<p>5. Directing&mdash;taking charge, assigning tasks, arranging for things to be
done properly, ensuring that people are functioning effectively, and
providing leadership for the department.
</p>
<p>���'�'��$����
</p>
<p>Knowledge of how bibliographic data are created and used is essential for a
cataloging department manager to perform the tasks listed above. The manager
must, however, have other skills as well, which do not involve bibliographic in-
formation at all. These include communication skills, political skills, financial
skills, and leadership skills.
</p>
<p>Communication skills&mdash;both speaking and writing&mdash;are important to con-
vey one&rsquo;s ideas to the people with whom one comes into contact. Those who
work in the cataloging department initially need training to do their work. Even
if they are skilled at cataloging and classification, the local situation must be ex-
plained and any special rules and procedures described. This will be particularly
important if the person has come from a different type of library. Workers at all
levels need to know what is expected of them, the meaning of policies, and how
local procedures are to be followed.
</p>
<p>When new staff are recruited and interviewed, the department manager
may be expected to write or edit the job description. When selected candidates
are brought to the institution for onsite interviews, the department manager
should be a major participant, and usually is expected to ask questions of each
candidate and describe the work of the department.
</p>
<p>The department manager must be able discuss the department with other
staff, with administrators, and with peers at other libraries. Often the manager
must speak or write to suppliers, computer system vendors, and a variety of out-
siders who are involved in that department&rsquo;s operations from time to time. The
department manager is responsible for writing periodic reports, evaluations of
staff and operations, proposals for new equipment, new policies, and new proce-
dures, and keeping up correspondence for the department within and outside of
the organization.
</p>
<p>Political skills&mdash;defined as the skills needed to get things done with
people&mdash;are important to the cataloging department manager to have the depart-
ment&rsquo;s needs recognized and its programs and budgets approved. Political skills
encompass being persuasive, putting forth ideas in ways that will appeal to deci-
sion makers, and being able to build support for new proposals. Political skills
also aid the department manager in building consensus within the department,
</p>
<p>514 22&mdash;Managing the Cataloging Department</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>establishing and maintaining an esprit de corps that gives everyone in the depart-
ment a sense of satisfaction and helps the department run smoothly.
</p>
<p>Financial skills are necessary for planning the department&rsquo;s budget, de-
fending it successfully before higher authorities within the organization, moni-
toring expenditures, and evaluating the results at the end of the budget cycle.
Computer software is available to assist with the statistical work involved, but
even the best software cannot substitute for an understanding of basic financial
management processes and techniques. The cataloging department manager
should be able to determine the true costs and evaluate the total value of alterna-
tive expenditures, not just to learn the price of things.
</p>
<p>Leadership skills combine envisioning goals and objectives for the depart-
ment, imbuing others with the vision, and risking the decisions that make prog-
ress possible toward those goals and objectives. Any decision could prove to be
right or wrong, and the department manager who makes decisions risks failure as
well as success. If the cataloging department is to grow and change, develop and
achieve, it must have leadership willing to take on the risks of making decisions
because of the importance of achieving the goals.
</p>
<p>'�(��

���(&amp;���������'�(�&amp;��'"���
</p>
<p>The cornerstone of a library&rsquo;s cataloging and classification operations
should be a manual containing a record of all of the decisions governing the cata-
loging and classification of materials and provision of bibliographic services to
patrons. Developing such a manual takes time and effort, but the result is a docu-
ment that can be helpful to all staff members, whether they perform cataloging
and classification tasks or merely use these organizing systems to help patrons
find what they want. A policy and procedures manual also can help to highlight
the way the mission of the library is served by its cataloging services.
</p>
<p>A bibliographic policy manual should begin with a brief description of the
library&rsquo;s community, school, or organization being served; an official mission
statement; and a summary of its facilities, staff, collections, and patrons. Putting
the description of these elements at the beginning of the policy clarifies the set-
ting and context in which these policies must operate. Also, any obvious discrep-
ancies between the setting, its mission, and the policies contained in the
document might be made explicit at this point.
</p>
<p>Next, a section for each part of the bibliographic system, arranged in any
order that seems logical to the staff, should include the decisions pertaining to
that part along with a brief explanation of why they were made. There is no one
right way to organize policy documents, although the most frequently encoun-
tered order is chronological, beginning with the first step in the process and con-
cluding with the final steps of shelving, usage, and deacquisition. But it might be
just as useful to divide the manual into decisions concerning descriptive catalog-
ing, the assignment of subject descriptors, classification, shelflisting, and pro-
cessing. Or it might be organized by medium, with decisions about books,
videos, databases, and so forth, in separate sections or chapters.
</p>
<p>Departmental Policies and Procedures 515</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Assuming a manual is organized by the various aspects of bibliographic
control, it can begin with a section on derived cataloging, if it is done by that li-
brary. Methods of searching, matching, capturing, and editing existing records
from the source database should be outlined. Knowing that every change made
to a derived record is an added cost, policy-makers will try to use bibliographic
records &ldquo;as is&rdquo; to the greatest extent possible. Any mandated changes written
into the policy should be scrutinized to ensure that the benefits they produce ex-
ceed their costs.
</p>
<p>The section on original cataloging might begin with descriptive cataloging,
specifying the level of description for various types of materials, the authority
control system, the way items that are part of a series will be treated (that is, cata-
loged and classified separately or as a collection at the series level), whether
some or all series titles will be traced, if or when multipart items will be analyzed
(that is, provided with separate catalog records for each part), and how uniform
titles will be adopted. Catalogers might decide to furnish analytic records for
electronic resources in which the individual files may be used singly, but only
one overall record for electronic resources in which the files are used in concert.
Different descriptive treatments for different types of materials might be speci-
fied; for example, collections of tests or college catalogs might be given
first-level descriptions, while reference collections and research materials might
be given second-level descriptions. Decisions about the inclusion or exclusion of
identifying data, the addition or deletion of descriptive access points, and so
forth should be documented in the manual in this section.
</p>
<p>The next section might deal with subject headings, explaining the source
for descriptors, numbers of descriptors typically assigned, the desired depth of
indexing, and any special treatments accorded to particular materials. For exam-
ple, if broad headings are desired for a small collection, Library of Congress
Subject Headings might be adopted as the source list for descriptors, but subdivi-
sions (that is, subheadings) might be omitted for all but a few subject areas in
which holdings are relatively abundant. Some materials might be indexed ana-
lytically, with descriptors assigned for each part of a multipart item, each chapter
of a book, or each cut on a sound recording. For example, a collection of Shake-
speare&rsquo;s plays, which usually are wanted one at a time, is a candidate for such
treatment.
</p>
<p>The section on classification might indicate the chosen system used, the
level of complexity within the system, and how hard-to-classify materials such
as periodicals or databases are treated. The method of assigning cutter letters or
numbers and methods of adding them and other shelf marks to the classification
number to complete the call number should be described. The choice between
creating unique call numbers for each item or allowing more than one item
to share the same call number should be documented here. Any designated
anomalies in the shelving arrangement should be noted, such as keeping new ac-
quisitions in a prominent display for a month or two; housing oversized books on
special shelves; or dividing materials by instructor, grade level, class, and so
forth.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Explanations for the decisions recorded in the policy document will enable
one&rsquo;s successors to understand the reasoning behind them and, as conditions
change, to recognize when there is a need to make changes.
</p>
<p>A wise addition to any statement of policies or procedures is the establish-
ment of regular review and amendment processes. Annual or biennial policy re-
views might seem unnecessary at the time new policies are instituted, but they
are a good idea. Frequent reviews head off crises caused by the continuation of
outmoded policies. If reviewers take the responsibility seriously and are careful
to examine every part of the document thoroughly&mdash;from the prefatory descrip-
tions, through each section of the main text, to the closing amendment process&mdash;
they might anticipate the need for change before a crisis occurs.
</p>
<p>The manual can also have separate sections in which procedures are spelled
out for accomplishing the tasks required to carry out each part of the biblio-
graphic control system. These explanations of procedures, often comprising a
separate manual or several separate manuals, should not be substituted for the
policy manual. A procedures manual is different and need not document either
the decisions that the designated procedures are intended to support or the rea-
sons why those decisions were made.
</p>
<p>Procedures seem best when they follow the chronological order of steps in-
volved, but there is no reason why separate processes can&rsquo;t be arranged in any
other order. One way to arrange the procedures manual is by physical medium,
another is by bibliographic function, and a third is simply to put the procedures in
alphabetical order according to their names. No matter what the arrangement of
the procedures manual, it should be possible to locate an individual procedure
very easily. Thus, if the manual is arranged by function, it should have an alpha-
betic index by title; and if it is arranged alphabetically by the names of the proce-
dures or by physical medium, there should be a functionally organized list of
contents provided as well.

<p>An important set of decisions that should be included in the policy manual
is the response to major changes in cataloging standards. When new versions of
the descriptive cataloging code and the chosen subject and classification authori-
ties appear, how will they be adopted and implemented? Such changes occur
regularly, because their governing bodies all follow policies of continuous revi-
sion, so they need to be acknowledged and strategies for their implementation
developed.
</p>
<p>Among several possible responses are the following:
</p>
<p>1. Make all required changes for all holdings immediately. This is the
most desirable option for keeping the entire collection together in one
style of organization and completely up-to-date, but it is the most
costly alternative, both in terms of dollars and cents and the amount of
staff time it will consume in the short run.
</p>
<p>Responses to Changes in Cataloging Standards 517</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. Make no changes in existing holdings, but implement changes for new
materials immediately. This is the strategy followed by many librari-
ans, because it seems the best that can be done with limited resources.
The problem with this is that over time, even just a few years, the or-
ganization of the library starts to break down. What emerges is not
one unified collection, but several fragmented collections, each fol-
lowing different rules. This was the strategy of choice for many li-
braries when they automated; when it finally became necessary to
incorporate the older holdings into the automated system, it was a
huge job costing more than anticipated.
</p>
<p>3. Make all changes over a limited period of time. This strategy seems to
be the most reasonable when circumstances don&rsquo;t permit the first ap-
proach, because all the materials remain in one unified organizational
structure, even though the structure will take on different aspects as
various changes are implemented. It probably has the best payoff in
the long run, because it will ultimately result in the same organiza-
tional effectiveness as the first option but will not require as large an
investment at one time.
</p>
<p>4. Make changes selectively. This strategy also is popular with practitio-
ners and can be the best overall strategy when changes in cataloging
rules, subject descriptors, and classification schemes do not affect
holdings to any great extent. If a library does not buy many items
about music and its collection consists solely of a few works about
music appreciation, the library might choose not to implement the
changes in DDC&rsquo;s music schedules that appear in the twentieth edi-
tion. This strategy can lead to future problems, however, if the dis-
crepancies become more significant over time.
</p>
<p>5. Make no changes and continue using older editions. This strategy is
deceptively simple, easy, and cheap. Eventually, however, it breaks
down because it doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to keep up with changes
in materials, subject matter, and user needs. When the moment ar-
rives that &ldquo;something must be done&rdquo; to improve it, it will cost a great
deal more to address the changes than it would have when they first
occurred.
</p>
<p>Each of these alternatives&mdash;and they are not the only ones possible&mdash;has
advantages and disadvantages, and each will have a different result both in the
short term and over the long run. Although the first option might be an ideal re-
sponse, it also is the most costly; and although the last option is the least costly,
it probably will result in the least effective service to patrons, even though the
problems might not become apparent for some time. The other options fall
somewhere between these extremes, and libraries must weigh the alternatives
in terms of their individual situations and the impact on budgets, staff, and pa-
tron services.

</p>
<p>One person should be charged with writing the manual. This minimizes the
possibility that individual differences in style and language will produce sections
using different words for the same concepts and other potentially confusing lin-
guistic problems. Over time, more than one person may write sections of the
manual, but at any one time, one person should be assigned this responsibility.
</p>
<p>A good way to begin preparing the policy manual is to draw up a table of
contents, then circulate it among staff for suggestions about additions or changes
to be made. It might be wise to indicate that just because suggestions are solicited
does not mean they automatically will be followed. If major differences arise,
negotiation can produce an acceptable solution so that the manual is a source of
agreement, not contention. The table of contents, once defined, establishes the
scope of the manual and identifies the way that the whole bibliographic system
will be divided.
</p>
<p>Writing the manual might then begin by listing all the decisions and opera-
tions that should be covered within each section; for example, decisions and op-
erations relating to materials issued in series could be listed under &ldquo;Descriptive
Cataloging,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tracing Practice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Indexing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Classification,&rdquo; if the manual
is divided into types of operations, or under &ldquo;Series,&rdquo; if it is divided into types of
material. Either way, all the decisions and practices relating to the handling of se-
ries must be covered somewhere in the manual. For the user&rsquo;s convenience, an
index can bring together related information that falls into different sections or
chapters (that is, to bring together all the descriptive cataloging decisions when
the division is by material type, or all the decisions relating to series when the di-
vision is by operation). Word processing software enables indexes to be created
automatically, making this a relatively easy task.
</p>
<p>When the decisions and operations to be covered are listed, but before ac-
tual writing begins, questions about the style of the presentation should be an-
swered. Some of them are as simple as whether one or both sides of a page should
be used; whether sources will be cited at the bottom of pages or as endnotes; and
whether illustrative examples, flowcharts, tables, and so forth will be given
within text or as separate pages or sections. These decisions might sound trivial,
but they affect the ease with which the manual can be updated; the size of the
document (&ldquo;document&rdquo; is used as a generic term here; the manual need not be a
book&mdash;it could be a database); the ease with which it can be consulted, ex-
cerpted, or duplicated; its applicability to the task of training new staff; and simi-
lar capabilities. Other decisions include the approach to describing operations, as
step-by-step procedures or straight narratives; the amount and types of illustra-
tion; the inclusion or exclusion of supporting material (such as quoting Library
of Congress rule interpretations in full or citing the page in a different document
on which the interpretation appears); and so forth.
</p>
<p>At this point, with the content, approach, and style clearly defined, writing
can begin. If the person designated as the writer is knowledgeable in all the areas
covered by the manual, he or she should begin writing each part, section, and
chapter, completing them according to an agreed-upon schedule. If the manual
includes procedures that the writer does not know well enough to describe them
</p>
<p>Writing the Policy Manual 519</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>completely, these should be done jointly with a knowledgeable guide, or another
person should submit a draft to the writer, who will put it into final format. Either
way, as each portion is written, it is wise to circulate it among the staff who will
be expected to implement the decisions, or who actually perform the tasks, to be
certain the information given is clear and usable. The writer should expect to edit
the work not only to account for solicited feedback from staff members, but also
to enhance, clarify, sharpen, and polish the text, based on his or her own
rereadings.
</p>
<p>When enough of the manual is completed to warrant its distribution, the
first few months (or longer) of its use should be considered a &ldquo;test run&rdquo; to see
how well it functions. It might be issued in chapters or sections, or upon comple-
tion of the whole. With actual use, however, unanticipated problems can arise,
which usually must be resolved by revising the language, examples and illustra-
tions, finding aids, and so forth. Occasionally, enough difficulty is encountered
to prompt reconsidering the basic organization, format, or style, and to suggest
doing a major overhaul. In this event, it is best to weigh the true need for a total
revision versus continuing to try making the existing manual &ldquo;work.&rdquo; The first
version of a manual need not be the last, but the difficulties should be evaluated
carefully and estimates made that changes in style or approach can achieve the
desired improvement before discarding an existing document. It is realistic to ex-
pect several months of revision to follow issuing any new manual to discover and
work out all its &ldquo;bugs.&rdquo; The problems are not anyone&rsquo;s fault. Revision is inherent
in the process of obtaining an effective manual.
</p>
<p>�'&amp;(
��%�
���(&amp;���)�+��"��
</p>
<p>As a final step before a policy manual is adopted, it is essential for adminis-
trators to affirm whatever policies it presents. It will do little good to decide to
put some bibliographic policy in place if those responsible for the library are un-
willing to support its ideas, fund its implementation, and appreciate its value to
the organization being served.
</p>
<p>In connection with seeking administrative approval for policies, librarians
must be prepared to document the needs served by particular policies, know their
costs, and defend the expenditures. Whether or not a costly change is being con-
templated, it is fair for an administrator to expect cataloging department manag-
ers to answer questions about the costs and benefits of bibliographic policies, to
argue persuasively on behalf of proposed policies, and to negotiate compromise
positions, when necessary.

</p>
<p>After incoming materials have been cataloged and classified and their data
entered into the library&rsquo;s catalog and shelflist, they should be processed for use.
Physical processing aims to identify and protect library materials. It can include
all or some of the following steps: (1) establishing library ownership, (2) label-
ing materials with call numbers and other location marks, (3) adding whatever is
</p>
<p>520 22&mdash;Managing the Cataloging Department</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>required by the library&rsquo;s circulation system, (4) inserting security devices, and
(5) putting on protective covers, and so forth. A number of different methods are
possible for accomplishing each step.
</p>
<p>Commonly encountered ownership identification methods are stamping
the library&rsquo;s name in indelible ink on pages, covers, or other parts of paper-based
items, or, in the case of books, on the edges of the textblock (called edge-stamp-
ing); gluing or placing self-adhesive bookplates, decals, or labels bearing the li-
brary&rsquo;s name or logo in or on items; embossing a page of a book or other
paper-based item with the library&rsquo;s name or logo; and engraving the name or
logo on metal, plastic, and so forth. Tiny preprinted decals can be purchased to
be applied to blank areas of optical or magnetic disks. Few of these methods are
reversible, although some self-adhesive labels can be removed without leaving a
noticeable residue. In practice, some methods are extremely obtrusive. Care
should be taken that the glues, inks, and other substances used in establishing the
library&rsquo;s ownership are not, themselves, destructive to the materials, and that
they do not obscure information patrons want to see.
</p>
<p>When library collections consisted mainly of clothbound books, call num-
bers were engraved or stamped into their spines, and they were likely to be deco-
rated with gold- or silver-colored metals, or ink that contrasted with the colors of
the covers. Labeling machines that permanently affixed call number labels with
strong glue or tape were common in mid-twentieth century. Currently, library
materials of many different types are stored in plastic, cardboard, or metal con-
tainers as well as traditional cloth boards, and self-adhesive labels that adhere to
any surface can be applied to all of them. With use and frequent handling, how-
ever, these labels have a tendency to curl up and fall off, making it necessary for
processors to add strips of clear tape to hold them on. The tape thus used should
be harmless to the surfaces of the materials.
</p>
<p>Library circulation systems used today usually require bar-coding the ma-
terials to provide each item with a unique computer-readable identifier. Bar
codes have replaced copy numbers and supply a great deal more information em-
bedded in the codes. In addition, libraries may wish to insert date due slips or
cards in pockets in each item being circulated. Reserve materials and reference
materials may receive different processing, depending on the particular
loan-tracking system for the hourly loans these materials generally have. A dif-
ferent and less obtrusive date due system employed for new books at the Mount
Holyoke College Library requires no permanent devices other than the bar
codes. Instead, a small, easily removed self-adhesive label stamped with the due
date is slipped on the part of the inside cover that lies behind the dust jacket and is
removed when the book is returned.
</p>
<p>Protective plastic sleeves are marketed in many sizes for books and selected
types of discs. Paper sleeves are also made, but plastic has advantages, such as
being able to see through to the information on the book or disc; resistance to
ordinary tears; an absence of acid, which is inherent in some paper; and low cost.
Clear plastic jewel cases are available for optical discs and cassettes of various
sizes. Self-adhesive clear plastic sheeting can add sturdiness to paperback book
covers and help them resist wear and tear; exposure to rain or spills; and the
marks of pens, pencils, and so forth. All such coverings help keep materials clean
</p>
<p>Processing Materials for Use 521</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and attractive. Similarly, clear plastic bags with handles or hooks at the top for
hanging are listed in library supply catalogs to store book-record sets, small kits,
and other nonbook materials that do not stand easily on bookshelves. Codex-
style holders made of sturdy plastic or plasticized cardboard are designed to hold
several cassettes or discs for circulation. Their &ldquo;covers&rdquo; are large enough to hold
book-style card-and-pockets and, by using them, a library can retain and file the
item&rsquo;s jewel case with its identifying labels. A 1995 book by Karen Dreissen and
Sheila Smyth describes physical processing options for various nonbook formats
in greater detail.1 Perusal of the pages of library supply catalogs reveals process-
ing options for nonbook materials as well as books.
</p>
<p>None of the aforementioned methods, however useful they may be, can be
thought of as having permanent preservative power. Library binding, routinely
done to issues of printed journals to make them easy and convenient to store on
bookshelves, is the preservation method of choice for paper-based materials in
many libraries, but it is not the only possibility. Damaged books can be photo-
copied, provided the proper permissions are obtained. They may also be con-
verted to microfilm or digital formats, again, with proper permission. Although
these conversions will then require equipment to use the books (microreaders or
computers), they preserve their content, which might otherwise be lost. Encap-
sulating fragile paper&mdash;pages of documents, maps, photographs, and so forth&mdash;
between sheets of mylar from which the air has been removed can facilitate use
while providing a higher degree of protection. Similarly, enclosing fragile books
or films in boxes constructed of acid-free Bristol board can increase their useful
life span.
</p>
<p>When a decision is made to purchase materials in a new format, investiga-
tion into the appropriate packaging and housing for that format is needed; for ex-
ample, magnetic fields that emanate from many sources can erase magnetic
tapes, slides can be affected by fumes from many products, and variations in heat
and humidity are the cause of many problems. The physical characteristics of
each type of library material dictate different methods of storage and protection
to maximize their shelf lives, and the choice of containers in which to store
nonbook materials also depends on whether they are to be intershelved with the
rest of the collection. The Northeast Document Conservation Center in Andover,
Massachusetts, offers a wealth of information on preserving library materials at
its Web site, free of charge (www.nedcc.org).

<p>For several decades, the greatest challenge facing cataloging department
managers was introducing computers into their operations and upgrading them
as new hardware and software were made available. Far from being a better pro-
ducer of catalog cards, automation eventually required reorganizing the
workflow, retraining the staff, and incorporating all previous bibliographic data
into the new computer-based systems being implemented. Among the profound
changes that resulted are new patron services made possible by linking catalogs
electronically. If a library or media center catalog is linked to the worldwide net-
work called the Internet, searchers can go beyond the local library&rsquo;s holdings to
</p>
<p>522 22&mdash;Managing the Cataloging Department</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>seemingly limitless resources located all around the world. Even without exter-
nal links, a local computer catalog can be linked to other internal information
files within the organization, such as order files and circulation files, enabling
searchers to determine the exact status of a desired title or when it is due to be
returned when it isn&rsquo;t on the shelf.
</p>
<p>As electronic resources become more sophisticated, the challenge to make
wise use of them has not diminished but increased, putting pressure on library
managers to continue making changes in the way locally owned holdings are
cataloged, indexed, classified, and processed. The demand for high quality stan-
dard cataloging is increasing. One of the newest topics for consideration is the
cataloging of &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; resources, that is, materials accessible via electronic net-
works, to alert searchers to their availability. OCLC used the Internet itself to
distribute its publication, Cataloging Internet Resources, edited by Nancy B.
Olson.2
</p>
<p>Although computer-related issues continue to occupy a large proportion of
cataloging department managers&rsquo; attention, they aren&rsquo;t the only ones to be ad-
dressed. Another important issue is whether maintaining an in-house cataloging
operation is as effective as contracting with an outside service to provide the li-
brary with cataloging for new acquisitions and to maintain the catalog system.
Known as outsourcing, outside contracting has attracted much attention and
prompted intense debate. Deciding whether to contract with a cataloging source
outside the library or do one&rsquo;s own cataloging requires careful consideration of
many factors, including the cost, speed, and quality of available products, as well
as the loss of control over local operations and in-house expertise.
</p>
<p>Other issues of note are opportunities to use several subject authorities in
the catalog of a single library, made possible by the multiple subject fields in the
MARC format; difficulties of recruiting well-trained catalogers, caused in part
by the closing of a number of professional schools; development of standards for
minimal level catalog records called core records; and the continuing struggle to
make limited budgets stretch to cover everything cataloging departments are
called upon or would like to do.
</p>
<p>It may be just a matter of time until expert systems utilizing computerized
cataloging tools are developed that create full standard records faster and more
accurately than human catalogers can. Publishers could employ such expert sys-
tems to add full cataloging to every item they issue as part of the publishing pro-
cess, much like Cataloging-in-Publication, but with greater control and
accuracy. However, although the technological know-how for creating expert
cataloging programs has been available for some time, the complexity of biblio-
graphic variation has yet to be conquered. With the advent of this kind of auto-
matic cataloging, department managers could turn their attention to assisting
searchers in taking full advantage of it to find what they want more quickly and
efficiently than ever before. Patron service is, after all, the object of cataloging.
In the meantime, cataloging department managers must endeavor to employ
computing and electronic access to accomplish the work that catalogers have
performed in different ways since Callimachus classified texts in ancient times
for the great library at Alexandria.

</p>
<p>1. Make basic decisions about bibliographic control policies, then write
them down and stick to them until they are changed. When consider-
ing alternatives, keep in mind the needs of users, obligations to the
network, and available budget and staffing.
</p>
<p>2. Remember the tradeoffs between quality and quantity, trying to bal-
ance doing the best possible job with doing the whole job. In particu-
lar, beware of allowing uncataloged backlogs to grow while the
department&rsquo;s resources are invested in doing more complex or so-
phisticated work than absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p>3. Have the tools to do a good job of cataloging. An expensive reference
tool will pay off in the long run in the form of higher quality catalog-
ing with less anxiety.
</p>
<p>4. When deciding on a local rule interpretation or subject application,
write it down and use it for all other cases of the same kind.
</p>
<p>5. Try to utilize the cataloging information that others have prepared.
Examine what is being cataloged &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; and determine how
to expedite the work. If given the opportunity to outsource some or all
of the cataloging to a reliable vendor, be objective in analyzing the
costs and benefits of doing so.
</p>
<p>6. Examine problems and experiment with solutions. Own up to mis-
takes quickly and honestly, then move on to more successful options.
Try not to promise output that perhaps cannot be delivered.
</p>
<p>7. Develop a support system, and work at both using it and contributing
to it. Join the cataloging group in the state, provincial, regional, or na-
tional professional association, and be active in it. Befriend col-
leagues in the library, in peer libraries, and in nearby libraries of all
types; network partners and network representatives; and cataloging
experts. Write for help to us and other authors of cataloging texts, user
group and association leaders, cataloging educators, and so forth.
</p>
<p>8. Keep informed. Cataloging rules and tools are dynamic and are
constantly accommodating new decisions. Read the literature,
keep up with revisions, and take advantage of continuing educa-
tion opportunities.
</p>
<p>9. Inform those who use the library and public service staff members of
decisions and procedures, and seek their input before making them.
</p>
<p>10. Trust yourself! Undoubtedly, no one in the organization knows more
about bibliographic issues than you do.

<p>Service to patrons is the ultimate object of all bibliographic policies and
procedures, and should be the goal of department managers and all their opera-
tions. Standard tools and processes are recommended in this book because the
authors believe they furnish good service and benefit patrons.
</p>
<p>The fact that they change over time, however, indicates that standard tools
are not perfect and that the changes made to them contribute positively to their
utility. Librarians can benefit also by developing a positive attitude toward
change in bibliographic services that will allow the combination of creative
ideas, increasing knowledge, and dynamic systems to come together in provid-
ing better patron services. Ultimately, cataloging is a public service.

<p>The three indexes that follow provide a detailed guide to the contents of the book. The first in-
dex is a topical guide to the text followed by an index of both personal and corporate names.
The third index accommodates those who wish to study the figures and examples more system-
atically, and is divided into four subsections: Type of Media, Access Points, Description, and
Classification. Problems encountered in normal cataloging and rule interpretations can be
checked across figures and examples using these indexes. This should provide valuable addi-
tional practice in learning the rules.
