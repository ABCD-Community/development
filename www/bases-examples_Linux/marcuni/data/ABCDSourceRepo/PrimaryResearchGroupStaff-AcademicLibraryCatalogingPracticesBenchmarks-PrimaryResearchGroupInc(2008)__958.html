<p>Summary of Main Findings 
 
</p>
<p>Prior Experience as a Hiring Criterion 
 
We asked the libraries in the sample to rank the following characteristics as a criterion for hiring 
a cataloger.  We gave them four choices: not so important, somewhat important, important and 
very important. And for the criteria on evidence and leadership in a library setting, only 5.48% 
consider this very important. All the libraries that consider this criterion very important had more 
than 3,000 total students.  
 
Prior cataloging experience was considered very important by 27% of the survey participants and 
important by nearly 41% of the survey participants. Prior experience with cataloging 
technologies was considered very important by 13.5% of the colleges in the sample, while more 
than 43% considered it important. Research universities were somewhat more likely than others 
to consider a background in emerging cataloging technologies to be important; a third of them in 
the sample considered it very important, while another 44.44% considered it important.  
 
Experience with OCLC was considered very important by a shade more than a third of the 
libraries in the sample and important by 37.84%.  The higher college attendance rose, the greater 
the percentage of libraries that thought of OCLC experience as a very important criterion for 
hiring a cataloger. Interestingly, it was the M.A./PhD granting institutions that were not full 
research universities that valued OCLC experience the most; half of them thought of it as an 
important criterion for hiring a cataloger. 
 
Close to 30% of the colleges in the sample believed that experience with the classification 
system in use was a very important criterion for hiring a cataloger, while 36.5% thought of this 
as an important criterion.  
 
Close to 42% of the colleges in the sample felt that experience with an integrated online system 
was an important criterion for hiring a cataloger.  More public than private colleges thought of 
this as an important criterion, and the largest colleges in terms of total FTE attendance were also 
more likely than others to think highly of this characteristic. Nearly 56% of the research 
universities in the sample thought of experience with an integrated online system as an important 
factor in hiring a cataloger. 
 
Demonstration of teamwork was thought very important by close to 42% of participants, with 
private colleges far more likely than public ones to think of this as very important.  Small, 
M.A./Ph.D. granting private colleges were particularly likely to value this characteristic in a 
cataloger. Perhaps collegiality is simply more valued or considered more important in these types 
of institutions.  
 
Authority control experience was considered a very important criterion for hiring by only 8.11% 
of survey participants, while a bit more than 35% considered it important. 21.62% considered 
authority control experience not so important as a hiring criterion. Far more public than public </p>

</p>
<p> 40 
</p>
<p>colleges thought of it as an important criterion; more than 23.5% of colleges with more than 
10,000 students thought of it as such. 
 
Experience with the formulation of policies and procedures was considered a very important 
criterion in hiring a cataloger for only 6.76% of the colleges in the sample, mostly by public 
colleges with more than 3,000 students. 
 
Experience with the subject thesaurus system in use was considered very important by 16.22% of 
survey participants, once again, mostly by public colleges and by colleges with more than 10,000 
students.  Training or teaching experience was considered very important only by 8.11% of those 
surveyed, mostly by community colleges. Half of the colleges in the sample considered good 
verbal communication to be an important criterion in hiring, while close to 38% considered it 
important.  
 
Experience with MARC standards was considered very important by more than 43% of those 
surveyed; more than 70% of colleges with more than 10,000 students considered MARC 
standards experience to be an important consideration in hiring. AACR2 experience was 
considered an important criterion in hiring for more than a third of participants and a very 
important criterion for 44.6%.   
 
Strong interpersonal and collaborative skills was considered an important criterion in hiring by 
44.6% of participants; it was considered very important by more than 43% of them. This trait 
was particularly valued by colleges with fewer than 1,500 students. 
 
Experience with or knowledge of metadata standards such as Dublin Core was very important as 
a hiring criterion for only 1.35% of participants and important to only 20.2% of them. All of 
those who considered it very important were large public colleges with more than 10,000 
students that were research universities. Good writing skills was considered an important 
criterion in hiring by 19.2% of participants and important by 53.42% of them.  
 
</p>
<p>Use of Professional and Paraprofessional Staff for Various 
Cataloging-Related Tasks 
 
About 27.3% of the survey participants routinely use paraprofessional staff for original 
cataloging. Public colleges were more than three times more likely than private colleges to use 
paraprofessionals for original cataloging, and larger colleges were more than twice as likely as 
smaller ones to do so. More than two-thirds of research universities use paraprofessionals for 
original cataloging.  
 
More than 83% of the colleges in the sample use professional librarians for original cataloging, 
including nearly 95% of the private colleges in the sample. The larger the college in terms of 
attendance, the less likely it was to use professional librarians for original cataloging. 
 
76.6% of libraries in the sample routinely use paraprofessional support staff for copy cataloging. </p>

</p>
<p>Less than 47% of colleges with fewer than 1,500 students use paraprofessional support staff for 
copy cataloging.   
 
About 52% of those sampled use professional librarians for copy cataloging. Only 39% of 
libraries in colleges with more than 10,000 students use professional librarians routinely for copy 
cataloging, as did only about 53% of community colleges and only 11.1% of research level 
universities. 
 
6.49% of the libraries in the sample routinely use paraprofessional support staff for name 
authority cooperative work (NACO). All of these were public college libraries, mostly larger 
colleges.  41.56% of libraries in the sample use professional librarians for NACO work, as did 
close to 78% of research university libraries in the sample. 
 
2.6% of the libraries in the sample use paraprofessional support staff for subject authority 
cooperative work (SACO). All of them were public colleges with between 3,000 and 10,000 
students and all were community colleges. 27.3% of the libraries in the sample use professional 
librarians for SACO work; professional librarians from small colleges were more likely than 
those from larger colleges to do SACO work. 
 
About 19.5% of the libraries in the sample use paraprofessional support staff for master 
bibliographic record enhancement in OCLC.  Use of paraprofessional support staff for this 
purpose was much more likely by public than private colleges by a factor of more than 4:1. More 
than 44% of colleges with more than 10,000 students use paraprofessional support staff for 
master bibliographic record enhancement, as do two-thirds of all research universities in the 
sample. More than 48% of libraries in the sample use professional librarians for master 
bibliographic record enhancement in OCLC.  
 
No libraries in the sample use support staff for participation in PCC, CONSERV or BIBCO 1 
bibliographic work; 11.7% of libraries sampled use professional librarians for this purpose. 
Nearly all of these were private libraries.  
 
About 24.7% of the libraries in the sample use paraprofessional support staff for master 
bibliographic record enrichment in OCLC. Most of those doing so were public colleges and 
offered beyond the B.A. degree. Close to 56% used professional librarians for master 
bibliographic record enrichment in OCLC.  
 
36.5% of the libraries sampled use paraprofessional support staff for subject analysis and subject 
heading; half of all public college libraries in the sample do so. 36.4% of colleges sampled use 
professional librarians for subject analysis and subject heading application, including 50% of 
public colleges in the sample. 
 
About 39% of the colleges in the sample routinely use paraprofessional support staff for 
classification, including half of all public colleges and half of all those with more than 10,000 
students.

19.48% of the libraries sampled use paraprofessional support staff for master bibliographic 
record upgrades in OCLC, including close to 29% of public colleges. More than 57% routinely 
use professional librarians for this purpose. 
 
Close to 17% of the libraries in the sample routinely use paraprofessional support staff for 
establishment of local series, uniform title headings and authority records.  Public colleges did so 
far more frequently than private colleges. A shade less than two-thirds of the libraries in the 
sample used professional librarians for this purpose.  
 
About 15.6% of libraries sampled use paraprofessional support staff for establishment of local 
name, corporate body and conference headings and authority records; about 65% of libraries 
sampled use professional librarians for this work. 
 
About 15.6% use paraprofessional support staff routinely for establishment of local subject and 
geographic headings and authority records; more than 67.5% of libraries sampled use 
professional librarians for this purpose.  
 
</p>
<p>Gains &amp; Losses in the Number of Cataloging Positions 
 
The libraries in the sample gained a mean of 0.13 positions in support staff cataloging over the 
past five years. Most gains were incurred by public college libraries. The libraries in the sample 
gained a mean of 0.23 professional librarian positions in cataloging over the past five years.  
 
46.67% of libraries in the sample participate in library school student mentoring or internships, 
or the recruitment of existing staff and student workers into the cataloging profession. 
 
The mean number of librarians in mostly cataloging functions that are likely to retire over the 
next five years was a mean of only 0.27.  The figure was nearly 0.6 for colleges with more than 
10,000 students.  The situation was somewhat more serious with paraprofessional staff mostly 
performing cataloging functions; mean loss of this kind of personnel over the next five years is 
expected to be 0.65 per library.  Public colleges were expected to lose more than one employee 
each in this area over the next five years. 
 
More than 70% of the libraries in the sample say that their catalogers have salary levels that are 
comparable to those of public service librarians at their institutions. More than 94% of libraries 
at colleges with more than 10,000 students said this, while only half of community college 
librarians overall said so.  </p>

</p>
<p>Appealing for Cataloging Budgetary Support from Library 
Administration 
 
We asked the libraries in the sample about a range of tactics to appeal for cataloging budgetary 
and staff support from the library administration. The first simple tactic that we asked about was: 
the articulation of a vision of departmental excellence to library administration and others. 
Surprisingly, only about 43% of survey participants did this.  Research universities led the way; 
close to 78% of them did this. The next was: Creating and articulating new departmental services 
and work products to library administration and others.  Nearly 56% did so, and the tendency to 
do so rose with college size. The next was: Creating and articulating new departmental 
workflows that promote service improvements and integration.  More than 58% did so, and, once 
again, the tendency to do so rose with college size. All of the research libraries in the sample did 
so. The next tactic was: Marketing and branding cataloging and metadata services and personnel 
via outreach, newsletters and presentations. Only 9.1% of the cataloging departments in the 
sample did this, mostly public colleges, many of which were research universities. About 19.5% 
of the libraries sampled employed none of the tactics previously mentioned.  
 
</p>
<p>Work Rate Completion 
 
Most cataloging departments say that they do not specify quotas, yet many do apparently give 
some quantitative guidelines as to what is expected.  Some reading between the lines is required 
here. Academic library cataloging departments prefer not to think of themselves as factories and 
adopting actual quotas may seem like compelling professional employees to punch a timecard 
when they enter and exit. So, while there is no timecard punching, there are other, perhaps less 
intrusive ways to measure output.  
 
29.7% of the libraries in the sample have technical services areas that track turnaround time from 
Acquisitions receipt to Cataloging to shelf-ready distribution.  Only 2.82% of the cataloging 
agencies in the sample said that cataloger staff work product quotas are very useful and only 
25.35% said that they were somewhat useful. Nearly half said that they were misleading or that 
they detract from quality. All of the colleges that thought of quotas as very useful were 
community or 4-year primarily B.A. granting institutions.  
 
22.54% of the libraries in the sample find it useful to measure turnaround time from receipt in 
Cataloging to ready for shelf and more than 63% found it useful to measure this. Virtually all 
types of libraries thought of this as very useful or useful, though only 6.67% of community 
colleges found this very useful.

</p>
<p>Use of Cataloging Quality Indicators 
 
Error rates per bibliographic record are considered a very useful quality indicator by 31.43% of 
the libraries in the sample and useful by 55.7% of the sample. The completeness of the 
bibliographic record was considered a very useful quality indicator by nearly 41% of those 
sampled and useful by 52.11% of them. The indicator of error rates per authority record was 
considered very useful by 21.54% of participants and useful by 52.31%. The indicator of error 
rate per holding record was considered a very useful quality indicator for 37.31% of those 
sampled and somewhat useful by nearly 47.8%.  
 
29.41% found the indicator of error rate per physical processing a very useful quality indicator, 
while close to 56% considered it a somewhat useful indicator.  Patron or staff complaints as a 
quality indicator was considered very useful by 30% and somewhat useful by 55.71% of survey 
participants. Patron or staff commendation was considered a very useful quality indicator by 
about 34.3% of those sampled and somewhat useful by 55.71%.  Support or accomplishment of 
departmental or library goals was considered by far the most useful indicator of quality in 
cataloging work; close to 62% of those sampled considered this a very useful quality indicator.  
 
</p>
<p>Outsourcing of Cataloging Functions 
 
41.56% of the libraries in the sample outsource authority control, obtaining new and updated 
authority records. Half  of all public colleges and more than 61% of colleges with more than 
10,000 students do so. Close to 30% of survey participants outsource the acquisition of updated 
headings and bibliographic records; more than 44% of research universities do so. 
 
Also, close to 30% obtain new bibliographic records through outsourcing.   Nearly three times as 
many public as private colleges do so. Only 2.6% of colleges in the sample outsource item 
records and inventory and most of these were research universities. 11.69% of the libraries in the 
sample outsource barcoding. More than 44% of research universities did so.  
 
14.29% of the libraries in the sample use outsourcing to add table of contents notes and 10.39% 
outsourced the obtaining of book reviews.  14.29% obtained book jacket information through 
outsourcing, and 3.9% outsourced the acquisition of continuing resources (in print).  
 
About 15.6% of the libraries in the sample outsource the cataloging of e-journals; close to 28% 
of research universities do so. 28.57% outsource the cataloging of e-books; 39.5% of public 
colleges do so, while only about 18% of private college libraries do. Only 1.3% of survey 
participants outsource the cataloging of AV formats.  
 
3.9% of libraries sampled outsource the cataloging of foreign language resources for which they 
have no in-house expertise. Most of these libraries had more than 10,000 students and were all 
were either Ph.D. level or research universities.  
 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 45 
</p>
<p>2.6% of the libraries in the sample outsource the cataloging of other digital formats not 
previously cited. 5.19% outsource materials in cataloging backlog. All of these were public 
colleges and most had more than 10,000 students.  
 
3.9% of the libraries in the sample outsource all of their cataloging. All of these were public 
community colleges, of which 17.65% outsourced all cataloging. Close to 43% of the libraries in 
the sample do no outsourcing of cataloging functions at all. More than 61.5% of all private 
colleges in the sample do not outsource any aspect of cataloging. In general, the larger the 
college in terms of attendance, the more likely it is to outsource some aspect of cataloging. Only 
11.11% of colleges with attendance greater than 10,000 do no outsourcing of cataloging 
functions at all.  
 
</p>
<p>Reviewing and Editing Records 
 
20.78% of libraries in the sample use MarcEdit or other MARC editor to preview records and 
globally edit to local standards prior to loading.  In general, the more complex the degree offered 
by the college sampled, the higher the likelihood that the college would use MarcEdit or other 
MARC editor to preview records and globally edit to local standards prior to loading. 
 
24.68% of the colleges in the sample use a Local integrated system to review loaded records and 
globally edit to local standards; once again, the tendency to do this increased with the complexity 
of the degree offered. 
 
Nearly 24.7% of the libraries in the sample spot check vendor records whenever complete review 
isn&rsquo;t possible. 15.6% of those sampled always spot check vendor records; this was most 
commonly done by colleges with more than 10,000 students. 17% of college in the sample 
performed no or minimal review.  
 
</p>
<p>Cataloging Conference Attendance and Use of Continuing Education 
in Cataloging 
 
Close to 16% of the cataloging agencies in the sample have attended the MOUG, Music Online 
Users Group, and 1.3% have attended a Public Library Association cataloging-related meeting.

<p>courses from state libraries for cataloging training. Nearly 43% of the cataloging agencies 
sampled used conferences or courses from state library associations for cataloging training. 
 
5.2% of the cataloging agencies in the sample have used OCLC Eastern training, and 7.8% have

</p>
<p>Rating the Current State of Cataloging Training 
 
We asked the libraries in the sample to rate the overall effectiveness of the state of current 
training and continuing education in cataloging. We gave them four choices: poor, average, good 
and excellent. About 17% characterized the situation as poor, 66.1% as average, 13.56% as good 
and 3.4% as excellent. No public college characterized it as excellent, though 20% characterized 
it as good. Half of all research universities characterized the situation as poor and none 
characterized it as excellent. 
 
On the issue of assessing the effectiveness of the overall state of the ease of identifying or 
finding pertinent training events, only 6% of participants said that this situation was excellent 
and 36.4% said it was good. Community colleges seem to be having a particularly difficult time 
in finding pertinent training events. 
 
On the availability of training dates, only 1.47% described the situation as excellent and 35.3% 
described it as good. On the general usefulness of cataloging training content, 14.7% considered 
it excellent and 39.7% considered the situation good. The organization of the curriculum was 
considered excellent by 10.6% and good by 48.5% of participants. More than 61% of survey 
participants said that in general the handouts that they received in training sessions were 
excellent or good. Less than a third characterized the situation regarding registration fees for 
conferences and continuing education in cataloging as either good or excellent and more than 
16% regarded the situation as poor. The situation regarding the location of training was regarded 
as good or excellent by less than 28% of survey participants and 17.65% considered this situation 
as poor.

</p>
<p>The expertise of trainers was not a problem: Nearly 75% considered their trainers to be good or 
excellent and more than 69% considered the performance of their cataloging trainers to be good 
or excellent. 
 
</p>
<p>Rating the Preparedness of New Academic Library Hires in Cataloging 
 
We asked the libraries in the sample to rank the preparedness of recent library hires in a range of 
cataloging and metadata competencies.  They were given four choices: not at all prepared, 
minimally prepared, prepared, and well prepared.  The first competency was in classification 
systems and only 12.68% said that recent hires were well prepared, and 38% said that they were 
prepared. Public college libraries were more than seven times as likely as private college 
libraries to find recent hires not prepared at all in classification system competency. 
 
In subject genre/thesauri systems, only 11.27% said that recent hires were well prepared and 
close to 24% said that they were prepared. In Genre Analysis Principles, rules and tools, less 
than 10% were well prepared and close to 24% considered their recent hires prepared. In Java 
and PERL script applications none were well prepared and only 5.88% prepared; nearly two-
thirds were not prepared at all. 
 
In Cataloging Rules &amp; Tools, 19.72% considered their recent hires well prepared and 31% 
prepared. In Information Technology and social behavior in the organizational context, 13.85% 
considered their recent hires well prepared, 39.23% prepared. 
 
For Metadata standards for digital initiatives no new hires were considered well prepared, and 
only 14.5% were considered prepared.  In abstracting and indexing, 1.49% of survey participants 
considered their new hires well prepared, and 11.94% prepared. In electronic delivery of 
services, about 9% said their new hires were well prepared and close to 30% prepared.  
 
Only 5.63% of libraries in the sample felt that their new hires in cataloging were well prepared 
for work in technical services, and only 38% considered them prepared. Public college libraries 
were especially likely to find new hires ill-prepared for technical services. In general, colleges 
with larger student bodies were more likely to find new hires insufficiently prepared for work in 
technical services. 
 
In web and local network system administration and management, only 4.41 considered their 
new hires well prepared; 19.12% prepared. For traditional books, results were better: 25.71% 
well prepared and 35.71% prepared.  For non-book digital resources, 11.27% were considered 
well prepared and 21.13% prepared. For continuing resources, less than 25% were considered 
well prepared or prepared and for legal materials only a shade more than 8% were either 
prepared or well prepared. 
 
In special collections areas such as music, rare materials, archives less than 15% were prepared 
or well prepared.  Preparedness was lower than this for XML or XLST and in the economics and 
metrics of information.

</p>
<p>In discovery tools and applications only 3.1% were well prepared and 24.6% prepared. Even in 
authority control those considered well prepared were only 11.6% and prepared 24.64%.  
 
Only 5.8% said that new cataloging hires were well prepared in International MARC 
Bibliographic, Authority and Holdings Standards; 34.8% were prepared.  None had new 
cataloging hires that they considered well prepared in data modeling, warehousing and mining 
and only 7.7% had new hires that they considered prepared.  Results were only slightly better for 
competencies in information system analysis and were worse in programming languages and 
applications and in relational database design.  
 
In OCLC systems and services, 35.2% had hires that they considered prepared and 11.27% had 
hires that they considered well prepared. In digital libraries and collections, close to 25% had 
hires that they considered prepared or well prepared.

<p>18. When I was hired, a representative was brought in from the catalog consortium in which we 
participated at the time to train me on Horizon and OCLC Connexion Client. We no longer use

consortia and presented mostly through the MARC of Quality, but there are no in-house training 
modules established since there is only one catalog librarian position. I have the support of the

<p>Chapter 3: Work Rate Completion 
 
Does your cataloging agency have cataloging quotas, and please 
explain why, or why not? 
 
1. No.  The professional catalogers must teach and work on the reference desk.  
Paraprofessionals must integrate many formats into their workflow so no set quotas. 
 
2. No quotas for cataloging, however new staff are told how many items the average cataloger 
should be able to catalog when they are fully trained.  New staff who consistently fall below the 
standard during their probationary period are given quotas/benchmarks to encourage 
productivity.  Retention decisions take into consideration the new staff member's ability to keep 
up in a production oriented environment. 
 
3. No, the overall environment is very informal because of the small environment. 
 
4. No, but each person is given target quantities to aim for based on past production and library 
needs. If you spell out an expectation, it encourages productivity. Without it, production quantity 
tends to decline. 
 
5. No--It has not been an issue.  This may be because the director does not have a technical 
services background and doesn't know enough about what we do to insist on quotas.  We aren't 
going to change that situation. 
 
6. No, material is too variable 
 
7. No, too difficult to police, and there is a Union involved. 
 
8. A cataloger (professional or paraprofessional) may on occasion be assigned a quota for a 
specified period if s/he is not performing up to par. 
 
9. No. 
 
10. No.  Majority of cataloging and processing for new purchases goes through vendor.  This 
leaves more complex cataloging for employees; the efforts involved in cataloging such resources 
are, by their nature, not easily quantifiable. 
 
11. No. We are a small university in which all librarians do reference, collection development, and 
instruction in addition to their primary responsibility, so quotas really don't make sense in this 
environment of extreme teamwork and small staff (5 librarians, 6 support staff). I catalog as I 
can, given my oversight of cataloging, acquisitions, periodicals, and branch music library 
operations, plus the additional responsibilities mentioned above. One staff member is an FT 
cataloger; film cataloging is done by another staff member whose primary responsibilities are in 
marketing and PR, and who also does reference and instruction; and theses, gov docs, and 
special collections materials are cataloged by our Special Collections Librarian, who also does 
general reference. Quotas could only possibly apply to our FT staff cataloger, but she doesn't 
need them in order to stay productive and motivated. 
 
12. New materials should be cataloged within 5 days.  There are no other quotas. 
 
13. No. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 120 
</p>
<p> 
14. We do not use quotas per se. Rather,  a range of expected times necessary to catalog are 
given for different types of materials and cataloging and staff are generally expected to work 
within the guidelines. 
 
15. As long as the book trucks are not piling up we assume the pace is acceptable. 
 
16. No -- we're a small operation.  We do what needs to be done in a timely fashion. 
 
17. Not generally, though a quota may be imposed by a supervisor if a staff member's statistics 
show an unjustified dip in production.  My experience with cataloging quotas is that they create a 
sense of mistrust among staff, and may actually make some employees more prone to 
committing errors. 
 
18. No - work is current, based on funding for new purchases, otherwise I stay busy with 
archives work. 
 
19. No quotas, but we are required to document the amount of copy cat, original cat, and 
authority edits done. 
 
20. No.  With such a small staff, it would be obvious if someone was not working as expected. 
 
21. No. I will soon be joining a NACO funnel project for Florida, but currently I have no quotas. 
 
22. No since my job covers many areas.   There are weeks when teaching in liaison areas takes 
the full week.  The rest of the staff gets the job done. 
 
23. No quotas, but we do have guidelines for moving things through (LC copy=3 weeks max, 
member &amp; original = 3 months max). 
 
24. Not explicit quotas but a strong culture of no back logs. 
 
25. No &mdash; amount of material to be catalogued is largely dependent on amount purchased or 
donated by faculty. 
 
26. We do not have productivity quotas because we do not have a backlog. We do have 
standards for accuracy. 
 
27. No. 
 
28. No, we do not have quotas, only time goals. 
 
29. No.  We don't have a backlog of purchased materials (there is a small one of donations, 
which are lower priority), so keeping up with incoming materials is a sufficient measure of 
productivity. 
 
30. No.  Department is small and materials arrive at a slow and steady pace.  Rarely if ever have 
a backlog of materials. 
 
31. No, there is currently no evidence of need. 
 
32. No quotas, but for those who need numeric goals, because cataloging numbers are low, we 
set a goal to shoot for. </p>

33. No 
 
34. No, we are governed by collective bargaining and do not how people accountable, although 
that is beginning to change. 
 
35. We have a vague quota or goal, but it is not enforced in performance reviews. 
 
36. No - Our catalogers are very good and we have no backlog so there is no reason to set 
quotas. 
 
37. Not sure what you mean, but I don't think so. If I understand the concept, we have not felt a 
need for them up to now. 
 
38. No - we just try our best to get the work done.  Quotas would be unfair due to the variations 
in workflow required by reference and instruction responsibilities. 
 
39. No, we catalog as materials are acquired. This means heavy and light workload, depending 
on budget, which has been abysmal. 
 
40. No.  We're too small. 
 
41. No, we take care of whatever acquisitions are ordered or donated.  We're a small library for a 
small school, but we are affiliated with OhioLINK. 
 
42. There are no cataloging quotas. This is a medium-size library, and there is no cataloging 
backlog. 
 
43. No; expectation is for no item to remain in cataloging for more than 14 days. 
 
44. No. Most others in the library don't understand enough about cataloging to have 
implemented quotas. They're just happy we don't have a backlog. 
 
45. No.  We keep statistics about our output, but we don't have quotas. 
 
46. Since we pay per record, the time spent is irrelevant.  Catalogers determine the number of 
batches they receive, but are responsible for getting those completed by a deadline. 
 
47. Only based on time. We operate 2 locations as OPL's, so time determines how our 
cataloguing quota. 
 
48. No, because I do not ask for them. 
 
49. No. As a small library there are times when we are not able to purchase, consequently 
cataloging staff work on other projects. Comparisons of expectations for a variety of tasks would 
be helpful in developing standards for our catalog/tech svs staff. 
 
50. We have "soft" quotas, or expectations of only 200 titles per staff member per month, 
though this is subject to other projects that staff are working on. 
 
51. No. We're too small--we just catalog whatever comes in.

<p/>

</p>
<p>52. No. Our workflow is "seasonal" as it were, and we rarely have problems with backlogs. Plus, 
our support staff, being students, are 10-hour-per-week employees with little incentive to meet 
such quotas anyway. We're don't have the market for the kind of staff we can coerce with 
penalties for not meeting quotas. 
 
53. No - cataloging is done between other tasks. 
 
54. No specific quotas, but statistics in the form of numbers are considered very, very important 
by the Dean of Libraries; staff have been let go for appearing unproductive (not necessarily 
based on an understanding of cataloging). 
 
55. No, we have too many diverse functions that we also perform. 
 
56. We do not have quotas instead we have acceptable processing time lengths--we like a book 
to "hit the shelves" within 2 weeks of it coming in to the building. 
 
57. Relatively speaking.  We only have one cataloguer, so that person is responsible for getting 
materials on the shelves within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
58. We do not have quotas; don't know why that is. However, it would be difficult to adhere to 
quotas in the academic library environment, where the workflow varies widely from one month to 
the next depending upon faculty requests for new materials, number of library instruction classes 
taught by cataloger, and other fluctuating demands on time. 
 
59. No. We are a small, but very busy library with few materials being acquired at present. We 
are also lacking 3 positions, 1 professional and 2 para-professional, leaving a staff of 5 with only 
2-3 student workers. A great amount of our time is spent at the circulation/reference desk due to 
the staffing situation. We also have to cover nights as well as Saturday hours. The priority in this 
library is the front/circulation/reference desk. 
 
60. No. 
 
62. No. 
 
63. No, we have one cataloger, all based on workflow. 
 
64. No. 
 
65. No, I've never heard of them! 
 
66. We do not use quotas. We commit to doing our best to get materials out to the shelf within 
10 days of receipt in the cataloging unit, and we will catalog and process materials immediately 
upon demand. Our organization is generally satisfied with our performance. 
 
67. I don't understand what "cataloging agency" refers to, but we do not deal with quotas in any 
form. 
 
68. No.  I just catalog what we purchase, which is a fairly small number of things. 
 
69. We have stats, no quotas. 
 
70. No; work is cyclical - if nothing is ordered have nothing to catalog.  Also, have many part-
timers involved who have other responsibilities. </p>

<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks

</p>
<p> 
71. No, not necessary given cataloging volume. 
 
72. No, due to the dynamic nature of our acquisitions. 
 
73. No.  We have 1 staff and 1 librarian.  Our budget is small and we have no backlog.  No need 
for quotas.

<p>How does your cataloging department define quality? 
 
1. Providing excellence in access points for cataloging records. 
 
2. Quality is defined by the type of copy and/or workflow staff are working on.  For example, 
records used for retrospective conversion are not upgraded to current standards but if original 
cataloging is necessary, all current standards are met. 
 
3. The consortium has a minimum requirement of core-level records but higher level records are 
strongly encouraged. 
 
4. Producing the most accurate cataloging records possible in the shortest amount of time. 
 
5. By catching our mistakes before the items go to the shelves (double-checking our work) and 
by quickly correcting errors that are found.  We want the most complete records possible that will 
make it likely that students will be able to find materials for their papers and projects.  We do a 
lot of enhancing of bib records. 
 
6. Providing access to the material in a consistent and timely manner, using standards 
established within the profession. 
 
7. Following National, International, and local standards to the best of our ability while getting 
items through as quickly as possible. 
 
8. Cataloging to our standards, done quickly.  We are collection-rich and staff-poor, so we have 
learned to balance cataloging with the need to get things to the shelf quickly.  We also outsource 
a lot. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 135 
</p>
<p> 
9. Adequate access; almost no errors. 
 
10. The ability we provide users to find and use our resources. 
 
11. Lack of errors affecting access. 
 
12. Quality is best available record selected; processing, call numbers, etc., adhere as closely as 
possible to established quality guidelines. 
 
13. The demonstration of integrity in the catalog via ease of access, limited duplication and 
"cleanliness". 
 
14. Records of all sorts should accurately reflect content, descriptions, access points, subject 
content, and patron accessibility following current library and national standards to enhance 
retrieval in the library catalog. 
 
15. We don't define quality because leadership is not concerned about it. 
 
16. Accuracy.  "Proofread, proofread, proofread." (Edward Lowinsky, University of Chicago). 
 
17. Tough question.  Our goal is to provide clear descriptive information, consistent, logical 
subject analysis and organization, and appropriate linkages to resources both internal and 
external to the catalog.  We have a strong service ethic and are responsive to all inquiries related 
to the catalog or cataloging in general.  If we're not doing that, we have a quality problem. 
 
18. 95% accuracy in work. 
 
19. A MARC record with access points through title, subjects, and names, completed in a 
reasonable amount of time as determined by the staff and students' need for that item. 
 
20. Efficiency balanced with adherence to national cataloging standards.  But service to patrons 
and staff is the primary goal. 
 
21. Creating accurate and complete cataloging records. 
 
22. Since the entire department is 1 professional (me) and my part-time assistant, we just do our 
best. We have goals and when we meet those goals, we're happy. We've had to sacrifice some 
quality (such as authority control) with a switch to a new ILS that is much more cumbersome 
than our previous system. I like to see bibliographic records that are free from spelling errors, 
free from punctuation problems, all the correct MARC fields, added contents notes as 
appropriate, and correct classification. 
 
23. Getting the materials on the shelves and the best possible record describing the material in 
hand. 
 
24. Full and accurate subject analysis  Accuracy in index points  Rate of through-put  Consistency 
in following national &amp; international rules &amp; guidelines. 
 
25. Quality consists of both accurate metadata (especially descriptive metadata) and the getting 
material into the collection quickly.

</p>
<p>26. 1) Comprehensive and accurate description of materials received  2) Classification of such 
materials in such a manner as will be most helpful to our users  3)Timely processing of said 
materials. 
 
27. We define quality for support staff by percentage error rate in the following: selection or 
suitability of OCLC record as a match for item cataloged; correcting typographical errors in the 
following fields:  100, 245, 260, 300, 5XX; making appropriate edits to bibliographic and holdings 
records; accurate creation of item and holdings records; recognizing cataloging problems and 
bringing them to the attention of a supervisor. For cataloging librarians: quality is defined by 
excellent original cataloging based on AACR2 full-level standards; name authority records created 
to standards set by NACO; effective supervision of support staff, including timely resolution of 
questions and problems; a reasonable turnaround time for materials so that a backlog is not 
created or growing; responsiveness to needs of internal and external patrons. 
completeness, efficiency, responsive to queries and complaints. 
 
28. Item ready on the shelf with accurate, complete cataloging records in system within 1 month 
of acquisition. 
 
29. Materials cataloged and processed promptly yet carefully. 
 
30. Ease of findability of library materials. 
 
31. Quality is defined as a complete description of a work, including all access points, notes, 
subjects, classification, in order to provide the online catalog user with the most information 
possible to determine if this work fits their needs. 
 
32. Useful, complete, and intuitive bibliographic records which enhance our student/faculty/staff 
library experience. 
 
33. No. 
 
34. Sufficient description. 
 
35. Our catalogers have a very high level work ethic and they take great pride in moving 
materials out as fast and as accurately as possible.  Few complaints would definitely indicate 
quality and also commendations from faculty and staff. 
 
36. Accuracy of entries and time from arrival of material until it is on the shelf. 
 
37. Conformance with generally accepted standards and usability by patrons in the catalog. 
 
38. Complete bib records with subject classification to match the college's instructional program.  
 
39. Links to online resources when appropriate. Accurate item records. 
 
40. Unfortunately, we are a small and somewhat inexperienced staff who do everything.  Quality 
is finding the best record we can and getting access to the item as quickly as we can.  Record 
perfection is not a goal. 
 
41. Patrons can find our materials will little or no trouble. 
 
42. Adherence to internationally established cataloging codes and locally-established 
policies/procedures in the description of all library materials. </p>

</p>
<p> 
43. Achieving excellence. 
 
44. I expect very few errors. My paraprofessional understands the importance of accuracy, but is 
easily distracted. After 4 years on the job, I still must check all books that she processes. The 
error rate ranges from only a few on a truck to nearly half of a truck. 
 
45. Adherence to standards; participation in statewide network &amp; its standards; professional, 
experienced catalogers doing the work; no significant backlogs; full use of authority control 
vendor; using only two well-trained student workers instead of many to do processing; rush 
cataloging requests handled immediately. 
 
46. Error free records prepared in accordance with AACR2/MARC and local adaptations. 
Error-free and quality/level of cataloging. 
 
47. Having records with valid subject headings, description and classification. 
 
48. No stated definition. 
 
49. Least number of errors while maintaining high productivity and turnaround time. 
 
50. Can we find the book when we need it? 
 
51. If the record accurately describes the work in hand and effectively directs the searcher to the 
appropriate content, then it meets our standard of quality. Timeliness is only an issue when 
faculty spell out expectations for turnaround of requested materials. 
 
52. The call number puts material in the same area as other books on the topic. 
 
53. I define it more strictly than the Dean and Deparmental Chair. Quality means correct 
application of headings, uniform titles, spelling, accuracy in identifying and applying the title and 
alternative titles, correct choice of MARC fields, attention to some of the most important fixed 
fields used in OPAC display, searching, and report making. 
 
54. An item that a faculty person requests, is ordered and received quickly, cataloged promptly 
with enough points of access to make it accurately and easily found again through our OPAC and 
a notification sent to the initial requester. The item is processed and shelved accurately.  All work 
done should be prompt and correct. 
 
55. The Library is not a research university, therefore it has little original cataloging to do and 
quality is defined in terms of materials being accessible to the patron in a timely manner. 
 
56. Getting the items on the shelves in a reasonable amount of time and knowing that items are 
retrievable easily by Reference librarian and patrons. 
 
57. Ideally, we would like materials to be ready for circulation within 2-4 weeks of receipt by 
Acquisitions Dept., but this typically is accomplished only for faculty purchases, which get priority 
over all other materials. 
 
58. There are no local definitions or checks for quality in our cataloging department. 
 
59. Quick turnaround time; accurate holdings in OPAC.

<p>60. Timely, current, correct metadata records 
 
61. Does the catalog work, does it make sense, can students find what they need. 
 
62. Material is available and accessible to patrons and other users of online catalog. 
 
63. Low backlog, excellence of record. 
 
64. Ordering and processing materials accurately and in a timely manner to meet

and that assist users in finding, selecting, locating, and obtaining information resources within 
our collection that meet their information needs efficiently.

<p>Has your cataloging department ever conducted cost-time-motion 
studies or data driven analysis for any cataloging workflows? Please 
explain. 
 
1. No. 
 
2. A time-motion study was done for each of our cataloging workflows: Copy cataloging of PCC-
like records, Other copy cataloging, Literature, Art, and Original cataloging to determine 
benchmarks. 
 
3. No 
 
4. Yes, we determined that over 50% of our output is for AV materials and remotely accessed 
electronic resources--this resulted in developing some of the positions into specialty jobs--e.g. 
music cataloger; AV cataloger, Electronic resources cataloger, etc. 
 
5. Not that I know of. 
 
6. Not since I have been here (5 years). </p>

<p> 
7. No. 
 
8. For a few years I kept detailed spreadsheets on activity and cost, overall and for individual 
staff, and it included staff costs.  It was too much work for the information it provided--I do this 
sort of thing on an as-needed basis now.  Our ILS pulls lots of useful statistics which I can 
translate into cost figures as needed, and also measure productivity. 
 
9. No.

12. No. 
 
13. No.

33. No. 
 
34. No. 
 
35. Not data driven, we have recently consulted with a tech. services workflow consultant 
 
36. I have not yet in my current institution (I have been here less than a year).  I did however 
lead a cost-time-motion study at my previous institution. 
 
37. No - I think these can be very misleading and have been used in the past to eliminate 
cataloging positions or move cataloging to an outsourced environment.  People tend to use "data 
driven analysis" to support the theory or outcome that they want, so I consider it a dangerous 
game.  If we were having backlog or workflow problems, I would be more inclined to look at 
something like that but the problem is, you have nothing to compare to.  You can't compare 
error rate to outsourcing error rates because you generally do not have both systems operating 
at the same time.  And once you have made the commitment to outsource, there is no going 
back regardless of the error rate. 
 
38. No. 
 
39. No. 
 
40. No. Our workflow is too erratic and budget driven. 
 
41. No. 
 
42. Two people do all of our acquisitions and cataloging.  We have streamlined our operation as 
much as possible.  I think at this point we would need more objective eyes to watch what we do 
to see if there could be more cost/time savings. 
 
43. I am not aware of any such studies or analysis for the cataloging department. 
 
44. No. 
 
45. No. No time!

<p>52. Not a chance. our "catalogers", such as they are, are also responsible for acquisitions, 
finances, teaching, outreach, tech support, circulation/reserves, reference, test proctoring and 
some building maintenance. (No, I'm not exaggerating.) Cataloging is a pretty low priority.

54. No. 
 
55. No. 
 
56. No - we have accessed our workflow but have not used these tools.

<p>Chapter 4: Technology 
 
Please explain any difficulties your area has faced in improving and 
upgrading staff-use of hardware and software technology. 
 
1. None. 
 
2. Staff are interested in learning/using anything that will improve their efficiency especially if it 
cuts down on repetitive key strokes. 
 
3. None -- we have found that the new web based applications run slower that the old command 
driven ones reducing overall productivity. Staff adapts easily to changes. 
 
4. Gaining the knowledge to implement upgrades in our technology--we have only one IT person 
in our library, and he is mostly busy with OPACs.  We need more technical instruction tailored to 
our staff.  We honestly don't know what the technology can do for us--or how to implement it.   
 
5. We are still doing way too much with paper! 
 
6. No problems. 
 
7. We're an III site.  We needed to migrate from the old text based system to the Windows 
based system.  People found the Windows based system took 'longer' than text based at first, 
but later admitted that the Windows system is faster. 
 
8. Every ILS upgrade creates some problems.  Here's a small problem we're having now:  some 
of our Macro Express macros are not working as well as they used to, but only on some PCs. 
 
9. Mostly we consider new technologies as opportunities. 
 
10. Innovative system sometimes has caused problems (mainly error reports) 
 
11. Paraprofessionals have always used propriety software.  Even Connexion and especially 
Millennium don't always follow Windows protocols.  Paraprofessionals are not adept at picking up 
new software applications. 
 
12. How timely! We had a great spine label printing program that ceased to work when we 
upgraded to MS 2007 (Access was the main culprit). We want to batch print sheet labels. 
Millennium can do this with one, and only one type of Gaylord label, which is wasteful, as the 
sheets contain other types of labels we do not use. Right now we're doing this, but we can only 
print labels for general collection materials, as Millennium doesn't pull information from the 
location field of the item record, information that indicates special locations such as Folio or 
Music. I am planning to call them about this in the next week. If they can't accommodate this 
need, and given the wastefulness of printing directly from Millennium when batch printing sheet 
labels, I will probably look into using the third party software Print Wizard. I have already 
determined that OCLC's printing options don't really fit our needs. 
 
13. Some staff are reluctant to move to upgraded software when the older version is still 
available. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 143 
</p>
<p>14. New staff rely on previous staff who may be absent for training as on-site trainers are so 
expensive. 
 
15. Cost and time are the primary factors. We are fairly current with computers and old, but 
functional printers for labels. We have basic software needed to catalog but not extras, like 
macro software. 
 
16. Our single cat paraprofessional has been in this position for 41 years and she herself is a little 
hesitant to adopting new methods / software. 
 
17. We had to wait for several years before switching to a new cataloging component in the local 
network -- because of budgetary constraints in our own IT department.  We required computers 
with more memory for the new system, and we had to wait under after the local deadline to 
switch. 
 
18. Ask me next year after we upgrade. 
 
19. None that I'm aware of. 
 
20. Depends on my recommendation and then budget constraints. 
 
21. Funding for new products is the most limiting factor. 
 
22. Lack of confidence has been a bit of a problem for some staff, but those problems are usually 
quickly overcome. 
 
23. We have the support from the library to provide just about all of the software I need to do 
my job including continued access to OCLC Connexion client, ClassificationWeb, MARC Report, 
and other software that helps with process (e.g., a program that prints CD tray liners). The main 
problem we have is the limited number of staff. Since there is really just 1.5 fte working in 
cataloging (and several unreliable student assistants), we've had little chance to train on more 
hardware/software. 
 
24. It is difficult to take time out of the busy workday to learn new techniques.  However we 
have encouraged the support staff to attend conferences and workshops in order to learn new 
technology as well as to visit and shadow at other institutions like ours. 
 
25. Learning new interfaces &amp; applications can be difficult in the short run, but staff is quite able 
and ready to embrace changes that improve quality or quantity of work done.  Most problems 
come with secondary systems which are changed for no (apparent) reason and interfere with our 
procedures or workflow. 
 
26. Have had difficulty getting the updated version of Cataloger's Toolkit to work 
 
27. The upgrading of hardware has been hit or miss, according to need; we do not have a clearly 
defined equipment succession plan, and heads of departments have had to fund new equipment 
out of unit supply budgets. Upgrading and improvement of technological skills for both librarians 
and staff has been fully supported by the library administration--travel funds for workshops and 
conferences are available. We also have access to a wide variety of on-campus workshops in 
applications through our university IT department. 
 
28. None. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 144 
</p>
<p>29. Being part of a consortium with a collective ILS limits what we can do locally. 
 
30. Administrative roadblocks; upper management unfamiliar with cataloging; low to non-existant 
budget; few advocates for department. 
 
31. Our problems come from having our library computer support department having to follow 
our university's IT security restrictions. This means we cannot have any level of administrative 
access to our own personal computers, thus we cannot install software, printers, perform 
upgrades, troubleshoot our PC problems, and so on. We have to wait on them to do even simple 
things, and they have to take care of the whole library. Additionally, we will have to have our 
library's network system migrated to our university's IT network, which means we will have less 
control over backups. 
 
32. N/A  
 
33. None. 
 
34. Hardware -- Cataloging needs sometimes exceed the basic desires for our refresh cycle, ie. 
we needed all staff to have DVD players before that was routinely included in a refresh, we are in 
that situation now with dual monitors.  We would like them, but the CPUs in our current refresh 
cannot support them. 
 
35. Funds are always tight but we have been able to send people to classes as needed.  If we 
need training, I advocate for that with the Library Director and thus far, we have been 
successful. 
 
36. Networking glitches (our IT person is in another city); Voyager (words fail me). 
 
37. Staff turnover and lack of institutional support for cataloging positions. 
 
38. None to speak of. 
 
39. Software is mostly provided by our IT department who have no idea what we really need.  
We're able to sneak stuff in, but not much. 
 
40. Time is always a problem because we have a small staff.  I do all of the original and copy 
cataloging, but I am currently teaching a library tech to start on the copy cataloging. 
 
41. Each staff person in the department is at a different level of knowledge and comfort in the 
use of technology. Some people want to be in the forefront of trying new software/hardware, 
others hang back until the last possible moment (and then some) before plunging in. This makes 
productivity uneven. 
 
42. Resistance to change both in procedures and in perceptions. 
 
43. No real problems. 
 
44. Newer releases of cataloguing software may require more advanced operating systems.  New 
releases may have bugs which delay installation. 
 
45. Lack of IT support. 
 
46. None. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 145 
</p>
<p> 
47. Staff ability to understand and remember new work flows. Staff resistance to change. 
 
48. Much resistance to this here.  Primary difficulty has been in keeping hardware current and 
productive. 
 
49. Software (Voyager) has generally worked pretty well, but it hasn't been updated in some 
time, because no one has the time to do the research and skills development that would be 
necessary. 
 
50. We have actually done very well. We are perhaps behind the curve in metadata cataloging 
and e-resource management, but largely this is due to the campus being in a quandary about 
which course management software to adopt. Overall, we are pretty happy with our ILS and 
have had few issues with upgrades and improvements. 
 
51. Need computers that will handle SIRSI JAVA WorkFlows. 
 
52. Training and developing an interest in hardware/software has been difficult for 
paraprofessionals; professionals spend a lot of time training and re-training  and securing training 
classes for themselves, for the other part-time professionals, and for the paraprofessionals for 
upgrades in both Connexion and the ILS, as well as upgrades in Microsoft. There is never enough 
time for training. 
 
53. Our staff is progressive but we find that a lack of funds and time hold us back. 
 
54. Cataloging staff at UNK who have been working in the department for MANY years are 
extremely resistant to any improvement and upgrades of staff-used technology.  Even upgrades 
to the ILS software are met with extreme amounts of resistance. 
 
55. Computers are rotated out of student labs every three years.  However, library staff  have 
needed upgrades sooner to match OCLC/library automated upgrades, so money has been used 
from the library's budget to upgrade.  No offer was made by the university to assist. 
 
56. Not sure what is meant by this question. Do you want to know if we have had difficulty 
getting funding to upgrade our ILS? (Answer is no.) Are you asking if we have difficulty with 
using the software after an upgrade? (Answer is sometimes; there is always an adjustment 
period after a major upgrade, which requires changes to workflow.) 
 
57. There have been no notable difficulties in this area except for the fact that there is an 
extreme lack of communication. There are only 2 people in the department 1 pro. and 1 para. 
Each of us has had to seek individual training based upon our individual needs. 
 
58. Budget limitations. 
 
59. Technophobia within paraprofessional staff; institutional culture of giving paraprofessionals 
rote, procedural instructions rather than training them to problem solve. 
 
60. Time, especially for IT staff, reluctance of central IT to tailor technology for a small unit. 
 
61. Migrating staff from printed resources such as LCSH and LC schedules and AACR2 to 
Cataloger's DeskTop and ClassWeb 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 146 
</p>
<p>62. Hardware is upgraded, software has suffered from lack of leadership by recently retired 
department head. 
 
63. Lack information to know what cataloging tools are available - such as the Mitinet products. 
 
64. We have had pretty good luck getting new PCs every 4 years or so. We recently upgraded to 
dual monitors for all technical services computers, which has been a tremendous benefit. We are 
stuck using really antiquated software tools that make our work more difficult. If we want better 
software, we basically have to develop it ourselves, which we don't really have the skills or time 
to do. We have done some development of macros using tools like AutoIt and Connexion Client. 
 
65. Turnover, reduced staffing, and resultant lack of training time. 
 
66. Our biggest issue is that the cataloging database I use is not able to be networked with the 
student machines, due to the way our corporate parent sets up the machine image.  Our 
students have to search a paper print-out of the catalog, which is frustrating for them.  I would 
love to be able to change that, but it isn't likely. 
 
67. Turnover in paraprofessional positions. 
 
68. Very limited budget for equipment purchases.  Currently need a new server for ILS upgrade, 
but no funding available. 
 
69. Our outdated ILS is being maintained while awaiting emergence of replacement products.

<p> 
 
Briefly list and explain what you consider the most useful new 
technologies (hardware, software, etc.) in cataloging and metadata 
today, such as wikis, blogs, harvesting software, DSpace for 
institutional repositories, any OCLC or vendor products or services, etc. 
 
1. Macros, wikis, online training. 
 
2. Macro creation software (e.g. MacroExpress); OCLCs Find in a Library function;  OCLC's 
Connexion client; MarcEdit. 
 
3. OCLC's experimental Classify Website has proved very useful to see what Dewey numbers are 
used overall. 
 
4. Hardware: LCD flat screens reduce eye strain. 
 
5. OCLC Connexion; improvements in our ILS (III), cataloging listservs--we don't use most of the 
technologies listed in the question. 
 
6. Macro express - Allows routine activities to be even more automated. 
 
7. Blogs, Wikis, WorldCat partners program. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 147 
</p>
<p>8. Wikis; blogs most definitely; OCLC including its newer services such as WorldCat Local, 
eSerials, and Collection Analysis; LTI authority processing (at least so long as we have bib 
records in our local catalog!); Serials Solutions and SFX (we have both, will decide on one); 
open-source applications like CWIS for our indexes/databases and connecting our catalog to 
Google information; LibGuides for our subject pages; Digital Commons for institutional repository.  
We tried MetaLib for various things but were not satisfied.  We have a homegrown system as our 
campus-wide Media Database (visuals and sound), using ArtSTOR as a presentation tool, as we 
were not satisfied with anything out there. 
 
9. OCLC enhancements  Innovative enhancements. 
 
10. ClassWeb and LC's Catalogers Desktop are very useful resources.  We're not large enough to 
spend extensive time with harvesting experiments. 
 
11. Wikis have been great for creating procedures manuals, enabling staff to keep their sections 
up to date, e.g., the staff member who catalogs films does the updates in the film cataloging 
section, and our Special Collections Librarian updates lists of graduates and alumna/e that we 
use in cataloging materials by these people. 
 
12. OCLC &amp; Innovative work together very nicely to provide a framework for good if minimal/core 
cataloging. 
 
13. We use OCLC products, ContentDM, and SFX from our ILS vendor. Most cataloging 
documentation exists in an easily accessible web environment, e.g. Catalogers Desktop and  
ClassWeb as well a local tools on a departmental web page. 
 
14. Library of Congress online authorities. 
 
15. They're nice ... but our library has yet to use any of them. 
 
16. Software (such as MarcEdit) that facilitates working with files containing many MARC records. 
 
17. Free access to DLC and WorldCat. 
 
18. Classification Web and Catalogers Desktop, as well as the open web, are extremely helpful, at 
least for experienced catalogers.  Especially at a small institution such as ours, where maintaining 
a library of printed cataloging reference tools would be very difficult, these online tools make 
adherence to national standards possible in a way that was never available before. 
 
19. OCLC, LCNAF, Classification Web (Library of Congress), MARC 21. 
 
20. I don't know if these are new, but ClassWeb-the ability to make local notes in the online 
product is wonderful as long as you continue to renew the product, OCLC Connexion Client, OCLC 
label software, MARC Report-this has been invaluable in our reclassification project, AUTOCAT 
and OCLC-CAT-these provide an invaluable link to other catalogers when I have a difficult 
question, OCLC Bibliographic Standards site, LC Catalog and Authorities online. 
 
21. Online lists as well as manuals online that are up to date. 
 
22. We have found a departmental wiki useful for recording local procedures, training material, 
and rule interpretations.  Blogs/feed readers are helpful for staying connected to professional 
discussions.

<p>23. 1) OCLC Bibliographic Record Notification service &mdash; Valuable time saver when adding tables 
of contents to bibliographic records  2) Cataloger's Toolkit &mdash; Useful when large numbers of 
authority headings must be changed  3) Location Changer &mdash; Valuable time saver for projects 
that involve the moving of a large class of materials. 
 
24. Our III system's capabilities for batchloading records, global update and report-writing; while 
these are not "new," they greatly streamline cataloging and authorities workflow. Serials 
Solutions' ejournal cataloging record service (and we also have high hopes for their new ebooks 
service; OCLC's Cataloging Partners Program with ebook and outsourcing vendors; Digital 
Commons institutional repository software. Blogs are an effective way to internally communicate 
departmental statistical information. 
 
25. OCLC-bibliographic and authority records  LC's Class Web  SFX, or similar link resolver (for 
public). 
 
26. Discovery layer interfaces, because they cataloging data (particularly subject headings) easier 
for users to take advantage of. 
 
27. Open source repository and content management software; communication and 
documentation software that allow for online accessibility and therefore standards and continuity 
between staff at various branches; Virtual international Authorities. 
 
28. OCLC Connexion is the only show in town for cataloging, and it remains our sole provider for 
all cataloging. OCLC's metadata crosswalk project may prove to be useful, but it is not fully 
operational yet, and I don't know if it will be available to non-OCLC members. Blogs, such as the 
Cataloging Future blog (and others) are very useful to keep us all aware of current events and 
trends in cataloging and metadata. I hope that DSpace will be as strong as OCLC's CONTENTdm 
so that we don't have to go running to OCLC for every thing that we want to do. I don't think it's 
a good thing to rely on one huge monopoly (OCLC) for metadata and cataloging. These are not 
commercial products, and should be freely available to anyone who needs to implement 
bibliographic description and authority control. 
 
29. OCLC Connexion is very easy to use. 
 
30. Blogs, harvesting software, OCLC connexion. 
 
31. wikis, blogs, harvesting software, DSpace for institutional repositories, any OCLC or vendor 
products or services, etc. -- everything listed here!  Also include XSLT &amp; XML editors. 
 
32. Digital Commons, Contentdm. 
 
33. OCLC and WorldCat; LC online. 
 
34. OCLC is indispensable.  We use Cat Express because our volume is relatively small.  We do 
not contribute original records or upgraded records to OCLC.  We also contract with LTI for 
authority processing. 
 
35. OCLC Connexion.  Our college is not ready for metadata. 
 
36. I wish I had the time to play around with the new technologies.

<p>37. I am glad to have Classification Web, but I still use the hard copies of the LC 
schedules...because of my notes.  I haven't used wikis, blogs, or some of the other new 
technologies because of time.   
 
38. I hope with the tech taking over some of the routine tasks of cataloging that I can explore 
more of the new technologies. 
 
39. I find that probably the most useful technology (not really new at this point) in cataloging 
today is the electronic discussion list, whether of general (e.g., Autocat) or specific (OLAC-L, 
MLA-L, OCLC-CAT, etc.) application. I have found numerous answers to questions I already had, 
questions I wish I had asked, and new policies and procedures worth considering and adapting 
for my library and the cataloging department. 
 
40. wikis. 
 
41. email distribution lists; professional organizations. 
 
42. I consider great internal computer tech support to be most useful. 
 
43. Z39.50 searching, freeing us from OCLC.    TLC's ITS and Bibliofile, with fixed field windows.  
Keyboard Express fro macros.  Google for identifying persons and corporate bodies.  LC online 
catalog.  Autocat. 
 
44. Worldcat and sharing cataloging records. 
 
45. Free, open access metadata generators. 
 
46. MarcEdit- for editing MARC records outside of OPAC and transforming MARC XML to MARC21; 
OCLC WorldCat Beta; DSpace is a bear! 
 
47. We've considered subscribing to OCLC, so we could import MARC records directly into 
Voyager instead of retyping them from WorldCat. That's still up in the air, though. 
 
48. Connexion, Voyager, VuFind (we're in a pilot program for consortial implementation). We 
have heard of libraries using blogs for their cataloging interface, but we're content to see how 
VuFind works since it uses some of the 2.0 concepts (tagging, folksonomics) in use elsewhere. 
 
49. OCLC. 
 
50. OCLC products have become more and more useful (though more complicated); unicode 
ability for cataloging in other scripts; wikis for procedural documentation; centralizing electronic 
versions of cataloging documentation by LC (Classification Web and Catalogers Desktop); 
networking opportunities online (blogs, technical services procedures on websites); help with 
authority control by specialized vendors (LTI). 
 
51. We use OCLC Connexion for bringing down records, etc.;   Voyager Software allows an 
interface directly to  OCLC to check the LC Name and Subject Authorities.  The Internet 
connection to the OCLC bibliographic standards is very useful. 
 
52. I think wikis make succession planning and documentation much more fluid today.  Twenty 
years ago changes in procedures and documentation for those changes meant considerable 
updating of paper manuals throughout a library.  Today when changes are made to processes, 
they are quickly reflected in wikis, network files etc.      Blogs and RSS feeds have also made it </p>

</p>
<p>much easier to get the word out to patrons about new materials, services and collections.    I 
think on the daily basis the accessibility of many of the cataloging tools in electronic format has 
drastically changed the time it takes to catalog materials.  Web Dewey, Classification Web, 
Bibliographic Formats and Standards, LCSH all being available online have made it much easier to 
catalog materials--and many of the features added by OCLC to the "new" Connexion product. 
 
53. CatMe. 
 
54. We plan to use a wiki for the Technical Services Dept. procedures manual, but have not 
implemented yet. (Reference and Circulation departments have done so, and are happy with 
them.) Have not really implemented anything else new with regard to ILS or OCLC recently. 
 
55. The only OCLC product besides Connexion Client that we have used was the replacement 
report for the former "SULOP." 
 
56. Current most useful - MarcEdit; OCLC APIs, wikis, OpenURL resolver.  Future most useful: 
networked level services for personal &amp; institutional identifiers. 
 
57. OCLC and my local system. 
 
58. Cataloger's DeskTop, ClassWeb, OCLC Connexion (browser and client versions), blogs. 
 
59. Content dm. 
 
60. Mitinet products which are similar to MARCive. 
 
61. MARC Edit and Serials Solutions KnowledgeWorks. Beyond these two tools, few cataloging 
systems exist that really exploit new technologies or give catalogers the support they need to 
utilize technology effectively in their work. 
 
62. WebDewey, Connexion 
 
63. Honestly, I just want an ILS students can search.  I feel like we are 30 years behind the 
curve. 
 
64. 1. wikis for ready, quick study of subject area  2. OCLC betas, such as Authority Identities 
 
65. wikis represent an unique opportunity to engage the next generation of users on their own 
terms.

<p>If you have outsourced library resources, please briefly explain why 
you outsourced certain types of library resources.  
 
1. We continue to outsource the cataloging of Chinese, Japanese and Korean materials because 
we do not have the language expertise to catalog these items.  In the past we outsourced the 
remainder of our Dewey classed items that were still represented by card catalog cards; several 
"Special Collections" that were only represented by cards in the catalog (e.g., English Short 
Title); a music score backlog that developed when we did not have a music cataloger. 
 
2. Sometimes we are able to buy records for certain collection sets: such as Net Library, Safari 
books, etc. and load them in batches. We also use LTI for authority control--importing and 
updating authority records. 
 
3. Cataloging something like e-books is beyond the scope of our staff.  We get MARC records for 
our Humanities E-Book subscription. 
 
4. We have done cataloging backlogs and foreign languages. Languages were in non-roman 
script and no one can translate here. When the library lacked a cataloging position, outsourcing 
was used to get caught up. 
 
5. Does question 25 refer to the items in question 24?  If so, we outsource all materials where 
possible in those ways.  We also outsource some special materials once. 
 
6. Most of our new print monographs come through PromptCat/YBP shelf-ready.   We outsource 
original cataloging of difficult languages and formats to TechPro, but will do so less with our new 
Cataloging Librarian. 
 
7. One project of Arabic gift books (none here knew Arabic). </p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p> 
8. Insufficient personnel 
 
9. N/A 
 
10. Years ago we tested PromptCat, but got cataloging in-house done faster. We used Marcive 
for government documents but incorrect records and system overlay issues caused more 
problems than they were worth. 
 
11. Because our cataloging consortium provides those services. 
 
12. We are piloting the outsourcing of cataloging for firm orders from our primary book vendor.  
We plan to outsource cataloging of approval plan books. 
 
13. Net library purchased from Solinet, Google Books, and other sources with OCLC records. 
 
14. Not true outsourcing, but we generate brief records for e-journals from data provided by 
Serials Solutions.  We download records for videos from Midwest Tapes rather than from OCLC 
directly.    We obtain records for government documents from Marcive.  Most authority control is 
done in-house, but Marcive provides authority records for new government documents cataloging 
and also updates (changed, cancelled records) for our complete authority file. 
 
15. We get MARC records for our E-journals from EBSCO because we wanted to provide catalog 
access to these holding but it was too much work to keep up with locally. 
 
16. Monographs were outsourced because our book budget increased dramatically and we could 
not handle the increased work with the staff we had. We use vendor records for e-journals and 
e-books because it's a more effective way of making these materials quickly available in the 
catalog. 
 
17. Marc records are purchased with large collections of electronic books. 
 
18. Outsourced bib records for e-books and e-journals because it was time and cost effective 
(records were offered as part of the packages). 
 
19. Sent bib/authority records to Marchive for error auditing. 
 
20. We outsourced some large ebook sets, as there are simply too many ebooks in large 
collections to individually catalog, or to use one by one via OCLC. We outsourced a section of our 
books backlog as we did not have the staff to gain control over it, and we wanted to obtain full, 
high quality cataloging in a quick manner. We have an on-going workflow to send LC cataloging 
records for books to an authority vendor, and then to receive matching authorities and updated 
bibliographic records from them for our database. We may utilize YBP's full MARC record service 
during the selection process, to be later updated and overlaid by PromptCat records when the 
books are received, with minimal checking to be done on the records. We also may obtain 
cataloging records for leased books, which would be overlaid by full OCLC records (done in 
house) upon their purchase. 
 
21. N/A 
 
22. Authorities, not easily accommodated with local system.

</p>
<p>23. I don't understand question #25.  E-books &amp; e-journals are outsourced if you consider the 
purchase of vendor records to be a type of outsourcing, like SFX or purchasing records for 
netLibrary (which I do).  But, plain old print monographs are not on your list and we effectively 
outsource them too through PromptCat.  This depends on your definition of outsourcing. 
 
24. Authority control is outsourced and sometimes ebooks come with MARC records.  Most library 
resources are cataloged in-house. 
 
25. Vendor records provide what we need and reduce our workload. 
 
26. MARCIVE supplies barcodes, and brief and full records for our Federal government 
documents. There is insufficient staff in that particular area of the library to keep up with the 
flow of information from the government. We have purchased some NetLibrary eBooks, plus the 
cataloging records for them. It is easier and more cost-efficient to outsource certain groups of 
materials, particularly those which are non-recurring like the NetLibrary eBooks, than to 
overburden the cataloging staff. 
 
27. Lack of manpower to manually add info to use free cover services such as Amazon or Library 
Thing. 
 
28. We will load thousands of e-book records rather than catalog individually due to availability 
and quality of the records. 
 
29. Academic libraries outsource to us. 
 
30. No knowledge of language of materials. 
 
31. We do very little original cataloging. Most materials have records available in OCLC. 
 
32. This question is a bit misleading.  We have outsourced parts of the workflow for certain types 
of materials, such as e-resources, where we outsource the cataloging, and maintaining holdings 
data.  We have also outsourced record derivation to our book jobber, YBP and have used OCLC 
TechPro to provide shelf-ready materials from time to time.  This was largely an issue of time 
and staffing. 
 
33. We get the NetLibrary collections, which come pre-cataloged. Entering those records into our 
catalog is a major effort. 
 
34. We're actually planning to use OCLC's NetLibrary records for our ebook collection. In a sense 
it's not really "outsourcing" any more than using WorldCat, except that we're doing it in batch 
from canned records. 
 
35. We tried outsourcing a special collection with OCLC, but the work of outsourcing these 
vulnerable materials proved more work on our part than just cataloging ourselves. We quit using 
the vendor after 6 months. 
 
36. None at this point.  Previously, we outsourced our book backlog but we were not pleased 
with the quality of the cataloging. 
 
37. We outsource music scores that require original cataloging because we do not have a music 
cataloger on staff.

</p>
<p> 
39. We use OCLC to obtain bibliographic records for all items that do not require original 
cataloging, and for all authority records. We subscribe to a book rental service from Brodart 
(McNaughton collection), which includes prepared bibliographic records and physical processing 
of books. This McNaughton subscription is for only 10 books per month, so represents a tiny 
fraction of our total cataloging output. 
 
40. Our outsourcing is limited to batch ingest of cataloging records provided by vendors. 
 
41. Limits - number of staff and knowledge of staff - of staff resulted in the outsourcing of 
authority control. 
 
42. The ability to obtain information at a lower cost. 
 
43. I work with Baker &amp; Taylor and have contracted for them to process items.  It was more cost 
effective to do this than for me to do them myself. 
 
44. We use Serials Solutions 360 Core to help manage our holdings for E-journals and provide 
our A-Z journal title list. 
 
45. N/A 
 
46. Little original cataloging done here. 
 
47. Convenience -- easy to acquire e-book records as part of purchase. 
 
 
 
</p>
<p> 
What are the criteria you use, if any, to analyze and determine the best 
sources of high quality records for outsourced materials? 
 
 
1. Availability of suitable records. 
 
2. We can't do comparisons; we take what HEB offers and check carefully. 
 
3. Only done once and used TechPro. 
 
4. Reputation, ability to meet local requirements. 
 
5. OCLC is always top-notch.  We have also used a local company, Donohue, for a project; they 
have an excellent reputation. 
 
6. Literature review; peer consultation. 
 
7. N/A 
 
8. The records would need to meet PCC standards and be deliverable promptly. 
 
9. We don't have a choice. 
 
10. Our vendor uses OCLC.  We're limiting record selection to PCC/DLC/UKM only. </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p> 
11. We expect OCLC to be standardized and check for any problems. 
 
12. Reputation and cost of service providers. 
 
13. Fullness and accuracy, for outsourced print monographs. For e-books, we take what we can 
get, and edit to match local standards. 
 
14. Professional training and judgment. 
 
15. We review the records using MarcEdit, opening them and taking a look-see for description 
and access points in various part of the file; We perform the field count report to see field 
anomalies and determine what the problems are and whether we can fix them or not; Records 
must have an LC call number and correct LCSH; We compare them to print records (for e-book 
cataloging) on OCLC to see how they compare to full cataloging records available 
 
16. N/A 
 
17. Sample record evaluation using tools like MarcEdit.  It depends on the record set &amp; how 
badly we need it &amp; how many records are included.  If there are 35,000 records (ie. an e-book 
set) and there is no way to catalog them by hand, we do not have very many criteria.  For 
materials that we could do ourselves, then we look at the fullness of the records, including 
subject analysis &amp; classification. 
 
18. Company reputation and procedures. 
 
19. We obtain them from the vendor from whom we obtain the material - e.g. Netlibrary, 
Cenage/Gale, Credo. 
 
20. Accuracy and completeness of records; adherence of cataloging copy to AACR2, etc.; ease of 
loading into local integrated library system. 
 
21. None. 
 
22. Having the cataloging department head analyze samples of the records to determine if they 
are acceptable. 
 
23. While we often catalogue all acquistions for a small spceical library, for an academic library it 
would be unusual materials, e.g., old engravings, scores, CDs, remote electronic resources. 
 
24. We make a huge analysis of outsourcing vendors, ask them questions, ask around to peers. 
 
25. Original source of the record, LC preferred. 
 
26. We look at sample records of all sources of MARC data before purchasing and loading those 
records.  In cases where cataloging may be subpar, unless there is an alternate source, we have 
to go with the less optimal data until we have the time to upgrade later. 
 
27. Our consortium requires OCLC standard records. Non-OCLC records are only allowed under 
special circumstances (i.e. electronic vendors who allow their records to be used in a global 
environment. So, to respond to the question more directly, we do not actively solicit records 
outside of the OCLC environment.

</p>
<p>28. It has to be easy for us to integrate the outsourced records into our catalog; cataloging 
needs to be as close to the best one can find in OCLC as possible. 
 
29. N/A 
 
30. We look at the expertise required to catalog the materials (language, type of material) and 
then correlate that to the expertise of individuals on staff. 
 
31. N/A 
 
32. Not applicable. We take whatever records they provide, then enhance on our own if needed. 
 
33. Must be: MARC standard; must be complete level record.

35. Not applicable. 
 
36. Our consortium handles outsourced Authority control. We do no outsourcing locally. 
 
37. N/A 
 
38. Price and ease of use.

<p>What, if any, specific metadata training does your agency need in order 
to provide an adequate knowledge base for metadata librarians? 
 
1. Hands-on workshops 
 
2. Variety of standards beyond Dublin Core and practical application of those standards. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p> 211 
</p>
<p>3. Not familiar enough to say, but at least a minimal level in the currently used metadata 
schemas. 
 
4. It's pretty easy to get general training in the most popular standards, but applying them locally 
depends upon need and appropriate software.  While we use Dublin Core for our institutional 
repository, we have developed other (Oracle) databases using local standards, with an eye 
toward being able to crosswalk them to Dublin Core.  I think once we begin digitizing LIBRARY 
collections we will have a greater need for training in the various standards. 
 
5. We use only MARC here. 
 
 6. Parameters and best practices for finding aids for special collection items. 
 
 7. MARCXML, MODS 
 
 8. Why are we so rule orientated when keyword search is most used? 
 
 9. Advanced serials training 
 
10. Actual hands-on training. Theory is fine, but I want to see the practical application of 
metadata. I want to see what it means to create metadata for different types of information 
(digital sound clips, photos that have been digitized, film reels, etc.).  
 
11. Training needs to be &lt;much&gt; more specific; it would be very helpful to have someone come 
to our institution, help us to identify what materials we have that would benefit from being made 
available in specific metadata formats, and then "walking us through&rdquo; the process 
 
12. None. 
 
13. AACR2r, MARC, LOC Authorities, LCSH. 
 
14. I'd like to see a core list of metadata standards and for what situations, what agency-types, 
they might apply. I'd like to know of a standard for digital collections and institutional 
repositories, and how it is being applied in various libraries, agencies. I'd like to see a set of core 
competencies for metadata librarians which also come with a core set of tools and practices in 
use. 
 
15. Don't know. 
 
16. I have theoretical understanding of how metadata works.  Not sure how to transition or begin 
from nothing. Not sure how this would incorporate into our local catalog. 
 
17. hands-on, concrete training.  Also, why is SOLINET not listed in question in question 29/30?  
We use SOLINET quite a bit.  And 29/30 are repeats. 
 
18. You name it. 
 
19. We need the money for digitization projects and for metadata tools first. 
 
20. We need to start from the ground up. 
 
21. Anything we can get our hands on. We basically have little to no knowledge of how to use 
Dublin Core, EAD, TEI, etc. There are too few faculty/staff to allow time for training and </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>implementation of these formats. This kind of thing gets short shrift because the normal daily 
work, which supports the mission of the institution, must be done first. 
 
22. ? 
 
23. I've only been out of library school for 8 years, but I had no idea RDA was supposed to 
replace AACR2 until this spring! I am struggling to quickly learn all I can about RDA, FRBR, FRAD, 
and other cataloging alphabet soups that weren't taught in library school and have been flying 
well below my radar. (Until this spring, I thought I was doing a fairly decent job of staying on top 
of the new material.) 
 
24. Training in current metadata standards and creation. 
 
25. Descriptive metadata, MARC and MODS, use of controlled vocabularies, creation of authority 
control. 
 
26. XML/XSLT. 
 
27. A better knowledge of internet cataloging would be nice. As it stands, nearly all our catalog 
records are print materials. 
 
28. N/A 
 
29. Have had no training. 
 
30. 1. Continued training in the basics for new librarians and staff and for review by experienced 
catalogers  2. Classes in choosing and practical application of newer metadata, opportunities to 
actually see and talk about how they have been successfully applied  3. Opportunities to visit 
with other catalogers at other institutions and talk about issues.   4. Classes, classes, and more 
classes (Personally I would like a class in XML, Dublin Core, LC classification, thesauri). 
 
31. I have done several workshops but need the time to develop the in-library program and 
policies. 
 
32. Don't do metadata at this time. 
 
33. We do not have metadata librarian. 
 
34. Continuing resource cataloging, MARC holdings; XML, RDF, OAI-ORE.   Perl for manipulating 
metadata within our OpenURL resolver and institutional repository. 
 
35. Any, specifically related to archives. 
 
36. Serials cataloging training. 
 
37. Our staff has been here a long time and need to become familiar with metadata.  They also 
will be cataloging the archives and need to become familiar with those standards. 
 
38. Training in metadata standards and systems other than MARC, AACR2, etc.   Training in 
computer programming/scripting and data analysis tools and techniques.

<p>Chapter 7: State of Cataloging Education in Library 
Schools 
 
What are your opinions and thoughts regarding cataloging education in 
present and future ALA-accredited library and information schools? 
 
1. Needs to remain an important part of getting an MLS. 
 
2. The bulk of our catalogers (98%) are support staff who have not attended library school.  It 
would be great if LIS classes on organization of information that cover WHY we catalog could be 
offered to non-students.  Teaching people HOW to catalog is usually a 6 month-1 year 6-8 hour 
per day endeavor that I don't expect a library school to be able to accomplish. 
 
3. It is minimal and is only a small part of required curriculum.  Metadata has taken a larger role 
in institutions but is also primarily optional beyond the basic concepts. 
 
4. Insufficient in quantity and quality. 
 
5. Would like to see more practical courses offered.  Most of the time libraries are teaching 
librarians how to catalog, not library schools. 
 
6. Seems to be in trouble.  Content is watered down, not connected to what is happening on the 
web. etc. 
 
7. I attended library school in the mid-70's, so anything is better than what I had!  I know a few 
library school students and they seem satisfied. 
 
8. No longer required in many programs, which is a mistake! All professional librarians should 
understand cataloging even if they never do it. Adjuncts (practitioners) are fine to teach this; 
does not have to be PhD person. Need more advanced cataloging courses in many programs. 
May have trouble finding instructors. 
 
9. Some LIS programs have developed and may require courses on how to use a catalog; great 
idea.  Not all librarians need to know how to catalog, but they do need to know how to use a 
catalog.  Unfortunately, too many programs no longer require any exposure to cataloging, and 
course offerings can be negligible. 
 
10. Cataloging/metadata/information management/etc. courses need to be required in all ALA-
accredited masters programs. And we need faculty who can address both theory and practice, 
and who are able to address current developments in metadata, and such as RDA. 
 
11. My own was minimal but excellent - keep it going! 
 
12. Cataloging should be required. 
 
13. Catalogers need to remember they are cataloging for users. Focus needs to be more user-
centric -- how would a user find the information being cataloged. 
 
14. There's always room for improvement. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 215 
</p>
<p>15. My cataloging classes date from 1979 and were excellent.  Can't judge today's. 
 
16. All students should have a general understanding of the structure of cataloging records and 
the structure of an OPAC. Future catalogers need to understand MARC structure in depth, and 
the concepts of controlled vocabularies, classification, and authorities. 
 
17. I think there is still a need for a standardized, required basic cataloging course for all MLS 
programs.  And a standardized advanced program for aspiring catalogers would be helpful as 
well. 
 
18. Information schools often only offer 1 basic course in cataloging and it focuses on 
monograph cataloging only.  There should be additional advanced courses for those of us who 
want to go on and become cataloging librarians. 
 
19. It's a tragedy that so many ALA accredited institutions no longer require a cataloging class for 
all librarians. It is so much easier to explain a cataloging problem with a reference librarian or 
instructional services librarian when I can explain in MARC fields/rules than if I have to invent an 
entirely different language to explain a simple problem. Everyone with a library degree should 
understand how the catalog works from behind the scenes. It makes us all better reference 
librarians. Unfortunately, due the flux in cataloging/metadata practices, it's difficult for schools to 
choose how to teach. Do they focus on AACR2 when RDA may or may not emerge soon? Do they 
look at FRBR and Dublin Core? Do they focus on OCLC practices or more generic cataloging 
rules? Whatever they do, students should learn. 
 
20. Not enough training - there needs to be a required basic course for all graduates so that 
public service librarians will be able to understand the OPAC. 
 
21. While education of catalogers is adequate, education of NON-cataloging librarians is 
remarkably deficient in the strengths, power &amp; usefulness of library catalogs. 
 
22. It is very basic and needs to be supplemented by a lot of on the job training. 
 
23. Although it has been a long time since I was in library school, my education in cataloguing 
was exceptionally thorough and valuable, largely due to the excellence of my professors.  
Observing or recently-hired staff leads me to believe (see next section) that technology is being 
emphasized out of all proportion to the traditional principles of cataloguing. 
 
24. I think cataloging education varies considerably in library schools depending on the 
perception in that school about the importance of cataloging. I also think that much time and 
effort is being expended in the name of metadata and digital library technologies without much 
payoff. As a head of cataloging, I need someone who can CATALOG and supervise those who do 
copy cataloging. 
 
25. Cataloging education does not seem to be adequately supported either by the ALA-
accrediting process or by the universities that offer library degrees. It is very much a step child. 
 
26. It's utterly inadequate, as is library and information science education in general. 
 
27. Not enough focus on cataloging. 
 
28. Cataloging coursework should be mandatory for all MLS/MLIS graduates; cataloging &amp; 
metadata topics should be broken down into multiple courses rather than lumped into one single 
cataloging class (i.e., class on MARC, class on LCSH, etc.); courses should be more integrated </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 216 
</p>
<p>with tech software and products in use (i.e., teach how to catalog with OCLC, various ILS, etc.)--
very hands-on work. 
 
29. Cataloging and metadata principles, and bibliographic and authority control, global and 
national, for analog and digital resources, should be taught as a core set of classes for all library 
school students. The history and evolution of these principles should also be taught. We don't 
know where we are going if we don't know where we have been and can't understand that the 
future is built on the past as well as the present. 
 
30. Don't know. 
 
31. Cataloging education needs to be very hands on. Need to work in the field and understand 
much more than in past. 
 
32. It needs to morph into metadata education. 
 
33. Since I have been out for awhile, I am not sure what the cataloging education is like. 
 
34. Not good 
 
35. The overall concepts are covered well.  There is a dearth of easily accessible / affordable 
"hands on" program availability for technicians/paraprofessionals. 
 
36. Library schools could do follow-ups and offer continuing education to their grads to fill gaps. 
 
37. My cataloging education was minimal and not very practical.  I had already been a cataloger 
for twenty years when I went to library school.  In assisting my classmates they said I was better 
at explaining what they needed than the teacher...who had not cataloged in many, many years. 
 
38. The basis for all online information about library and other institutional collections is the 
online catalog. Therefore, cataloging must be taught, and taught well, at all ALA-accredited 
schools of librarianship. Cataloging must not only be part of the technical services survey course, 
but also be offered as a stand-alone, intensive exercise. Ideally, there should be several courses 
within a cataloging/technical services track which would cover the basics of cataloging, authority 
work, holdings, etc., and the more advanced concepts of metadata, the various metadata 
schemes, writing effective policies and procedures, etc. 
 
39. As an adjunct at a library school, I find that the focus is on theory of info organization and 
not metadata and other practical content areas. 
 
40. I think cataloging should still be taught and that the first course should be mandatory. I 
empathize with those who are trying to teach right now since the whole world of cataloging 
seems to be in turmoil...I don't envy them their positions. 
 
41. At least one cataloging course should be required of all librarians. 
 
42. ALA accreditation standards do not specify that basic skills needed for cataloging be taught.  
Many current LSIS graduates are simply not trained. 
 
43. Cataloguing courses should be made mandatory for all library school students. Too many 
graduates with no exposure to cataloging. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Academic Library Cataloging Practices Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> 217 
</p>
<p>44. It's a waste of time and money. They don't teach how to catalog, but a lot of theory about 
the history, etc. 
 
45. Limited experience, but our recent UCLA grad hire is excellent. 
 
46. Recent graduates hired here have had a fairly good grasp of metadata issues, even if their 
practice skills are not so great.  They also have very good technical/computer skills, which may or 
may not predate MLS program. 
 
47. I hated cataloging in school, but I think I should have spent more time doing it. Much of 
what I know about cataloging was learned on the job. Apprenticeship or hands-on programs 
might have helped more than classroom instruction. 
 
48. Terrible. A lot of schools seem to be dropping cataloging as a requirement, and "cataloging" 
is being lumped together with "organization of materials." We seem to have forgotten that 
"information seeking" and "research" are not one and the same thing, and that even keyword 
search engines are better served with standardized description and heading assignment 
practices. 
 
50. Need to make sure everyone can catalog, sinc ethey might be in a one person library. 
 
51. Cataloging education needs to be enhanced by the library schools... more of it and more 
encouragement for students to study it. The prevailing tendency to define librarianship mainly by 
activities in reference and by teaching users how to use the library is out-moded. I wish the 
schools would recognize the true and neglected value of organizing information and making it 
easily accessible for all kinds of users. Perhaps then we would have more applicants for cataloger 
jobs. Perhaps then we would be able to convince our administrators that more staff time should 
be given to cataloging and learning the many new things we need to do our jobs. 
 
52. Too many schools have removed Cataloging as a course and substituted an Information 
Management Course instead.  These students have never seen AACR2r, a classification scheme 
or a subject thesaurus.  They are great with all kinds of new software and programs but are 
deficient in organizational techniques and standards. 
 
53. Library schools have cut back "cataloging" classes drastically over the past 10 years.  Rather 
than eliminating cataloging classes, library schools need to evolve cataloging classes to focus on 
cataloging electronic materials and teach meta data creation for digital entities and collections.  
Traditional technical services have evolved to the point where catalogers and technical services 
staff are now the primary digital project folks--this evolution is not reflected in Library school 
curriculum for technical services.  
 
54. Most catalogers have only one course or possibly two.  An internship is vital in recognizing all 
the various formats and variety of issues that come up on a daily basis. 
 
55. The library schools that have done away with cataloging courses are doing a great disservice 
to their students. Even if cataloging is destined to change dramatically as a result of FRBR and 
DRA, how can anyone perform these tasks if they are not introduced during the formative stages 
of library training? If we are not here to organize information, what is the point of this 
profession? 
 
56. I think it's being neglected in favor of other aspects of the curriculum.

<p>57. Need to provide more technical knowledge of systems design, relational database design, and 
web services.  Theory is good, but should be shortened.  They need to give "real-world" 
problems and have students review and recommend solutions.  The particulars of MARC should 
be learned "hands-on" in the computer lab. 
 
58. Too specific...need more basic theory 
 
59. Too few courses are being taught.  Those that are, are being included in generalized 
overview courses.  Need introductory and advanced courses. 
 
60. It seems to be going away. 
 
61. Must balance theory with practice with more emphasis on practice. Below I will rate my own 
skills. 
 
62. I don't know that much about the current state of the art. It seems like some schools with 
big digital library programs (e.g. Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana) are doing some interesting 
things, while other schools have dropped cataloging as a topic altogether. I'd like to see more 
consistency and recognition at the accreditation level that knowledge of cataloging/metadata 
management is a component of core professional knowledge, equal to reference, instruction, 
collection development skills. I don't see that now. 
 
63. Present in current MLS programs, but should be more. It will not increase, however, unless 
the job potential increases. Of more concern is maintaining adequate cataloging staff in our 
libraries. 
 
64. I found my cataloging class very useful (I am a 2007 MLIS graduate), and am hopeful that 
this is something that students are continually required to learn.  I would never make it in my job 
if I hadn't gotten a broad education in all aspects of library service, including cataloging. 
 
65. Too much focus on Information systems, and minimizing library skills and core knowledge, 
especially in the cataloging area. 
 
66. Quality varies, but has gotten better since I graduated. On the job training is what I and 
most catalogers I know have found to be most useful. 
 
67. Little consistency among instructional institutions and curriculum. Otherwise, very broad and 
general. 
 
68. Many new librarians seem to get very little cataloging.  This is still an important class that 
needs to be beefed up at many schools.
