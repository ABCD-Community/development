<p>Foundations of Behavioral Health is 
</p>
<p>dedicated to the memory of Dr. Kevin 
</p>
<p>Hennessy, who spent his career at the 
</p>
<p>SAMHSA working with a variety of federal, 
</p>
<p>state, and local stakeholders in the 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services field throughout 
</p>
<p>the United States.
</p>
<p>Kevin helped conceptualize this textbook. We 
</p>
<p>have yet to meet a more knowledgeable, 
</p>
<p>friendly, energetic, and considerate person. He 
</p>
<p>was a gifted person simply because he was a 
</p>
<p>remarkable listener. He also possessed the 
</p>
<p>unique yet rare ability to synthesize a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive range of behavioral health 
</p>
<p>issues in light of the relevant research 
</p>
<p>literature. He knew the clinical (micro) aspects 
</p>
<p>of behavioral health services as a licensed 
</p>
<p>clinical psychologist, yet he was able to draw 
</p>
<p>the macro-implications for services research, 
</p>
<p>practice, and policy. Kevin was only 50&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>young when he suddenly passed away.
</p>
<p>Even though Kevin possessed all of these 
</p>
<p>remarkable qualities, he was very humble, 
</p>
<p>devoted to his family, and passed through life 
</p>
<p>with amazing grace. Since our first telephone 
</p>
<p>conversation about developing a textbook on </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>behavioral health, we treasure the journey 
</p>
<p>we experienced with Kevin. He was, and 
</p>
<p>forever will remain, the most significant 
</p>
<p>behavioral health professional who provided 
</p>
<p>the scholarship and vision for Foundations of 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health. His tremendous 
</p>
<p>guidance, energy, dedication, and innovative 
</p>
<p>initiatives will be sorely missed by his family, 
</p>
<p>colleagues, friends, and readers of this 
</p>
<p>textbook.</p>

<p>Foreword
</p>
<p>Even in the twenty-first century, the public health community continues to face 
</p>
<p>formidable challenges. There is a need for more integrative and collaborative 
</p>
<p>approaches in public health initiatives, considering the complex relationships 
</p>
<p>among the social determinants of health within natural and built environments, pop-
</p>
<p>ulation health and health-care systems, and economic, education, and social and 
</p>
<p>community contexts. The continuing changes in the landscape of public health chal-
</p>
<p>lenge our ability to reconceptualize our approach to how health-care professionals 
</p>
<p>can contribute to health promotion, health education, and disease prevention efforts 
</p>
<p>in communities constantly facing the globalization of communicable and noncom-
</p>
<p>municable diseases and environmental threats due to man-made and natural 
</p>
<p>disasters.
</p>
<p>With an ever-increasing global focus on integrative approaches to solve public 
</p>
<p>health problems, it is essential that behavioral health professionals are seen and 
</p>
<p>utilized as integral members of interdisciplinary and interprofessional health-care 
</p>
<p>teams. While clinically trained behavioral health professionals come from a variety 
</p>
<p>of academic preparations in psychiatry, psychology, counseling, social work, and 
</p>
<p>pastoral counseling, there is also a need for these same behavioral health profes-
</p>
<p>sionals to develop strong foundations in population health and behavioral health. An 
</p>
<p>example of this interprofessional education and training is found within the 
</p>
<p>University of South Florida College of Public Health, where a cadre of profession-
</p>
<p>als are being educated in behavioral health (i.e., the study of alcohol, drug abuse, 
</p>
<p>and mental disorders from a population perspective) within master&rsquo;s and doctoral 
</p>
<p>degree programs. This group of professionals is uniquely positioned to educate the 
</p>
<p>public on disease prevention, health promotion, and development and financing of 
</p>
<p>effective service systems specifically in the behavioral health arena.
</p>
<p>This tome features the work of scholars from the academic and professional 
</p>
<p>fields of public health, medicine, behavioral health, social work, economics, crimi-
</p>
<p>nology, health communication, and pharmacy and illustrates the benefits of an inter-
</p>
<p>disciplinary approach to integrative population health and behavioral health-care 
</p>
<p>delivery. In addition, it provides a global perspective of practice and policy in 
</p>
<p>behavioral health. Each chapter concludes with a section entitled &ldquo;Implications for </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>viii
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health.&rdquo; This section reminds the readers of the importance of the chap-
</p>
<p>ter topic for the larger fields of behavioral health and public health.
</p>
<p>This text examines the critical relationships for understanding the importance of 
</p>
<p>integrating population health and behavioral health services from a variety of lenses 
</p>
<p>(national, regional, and global). Public health graduate students and professionals 
</p>
<p>would greatly benefit from exploring the chapters in this volume considering the 
</p>
<p>increase in complex comorbid disease clusters. In addition, behavioral health pro-
</p>
<p>fessionals would clearly better understand the nature of the important partnership 
</p>
<p>between public health and behavioral health for improving and sustaining the health 
</p>
<p>of populations at risk.
</p>
<p>I am grateful to the coeditors and the authors for providing such an insightful, 
</p>
<p>skills-focused, and practical learning tool and reference guide for the much-needed 
</p>
<p>population- and systems-oriented behavioral health professionals of the future.

<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Foundations of Behavioral Health is being completed in the midst of congressional 
</p>
<p>debate over attempts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) 
</p>
<p>which was originally signed into law by Former President Barack Obama on 23 
</p>
<p>March 2010. However, debate over health-care reform is hardly new, with many 
</p>
<p>attempts at health-care reform attempted during the previous (approximately) half 
</p>
<p>century.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are three basic reasons this textbook has been developed. 
</p>
<p>First, health care is one of the most basic and important issues in the United States; 
</p>
<p>however, health care is still not a right. Second, there continues to be expanded 
</p>
<p>discontent, as well as frustration, with health-care delivery systems in the United 
</p>
<p>States, particularly with access to services, treatment costs, and service outcomes. 
</p>
<p>Third, behavioral health (i.e., alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health) delivery sys-
</p>
<p>tems are disjointed from other behavioral health delivery systems and isolated from 
</p>
<p>health-care delivery systems.
</p>
<p>Foundations of Behavioral Health examines the organization, financing, deliv-
</p>
<p>ery, and outcomes of behavioral health services from both the United States and 
</p>
<p>global perspectives. Our textbook covers many fundamental issues in behavioral 
</p>
<p>health, including epidemiology, insurance and financing, health inequities, imple-
</p>
<p>mentation sciences, lifespan issues, cultural competence, and policy, which also 
</p>
<p>have implications for public health services and integrated health-care services. It 
</p>
<p>also addresses topics of concern to health administrators, planners, policymakers, 
</p>
<p>evaluators, and treatment professionals, including at-risk indigenous populations, 
</p>
<p>individuals in the juvenile justice systems, individuals with intellectual and devel-
</p>
<p>opmental disabilities, and individuals living in rural and frontier areas.
</p>
<p>The development and organization of Foundations of Behavioral Health has 
</p>
<p>been influenced by our work and experiences in teaching, research, and community 
</p>
<p>service. Our efforts culminated in the establishment of the Behavioral Health 
</p>
<p>Concentration (BHC) at the University of South Florida (USF) College of Public 
</p>
<p>Health (COPH), a collaborative teaching initiative between the USF COPH and the 
</p>
<p>USF College of Behavioral and Community Sciences. The BHC is only one of the 
</p>
<p>several US-accredited schools/colleges of public health offering a  concentration/</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>x
</p>
<p>focus/specialization in alcohol, drug abuse, and mental disorders from a population 
</p>
<p>or public health perspective. In addition, our involvement with editing The Journal 
</p>
<p>of Behavioral Health Services &amp; Research (JBHS&amp;R) has kept us current with 
</p>
<p>evidence- based practices and challenges in services delivery in behavioral health.
</p>
<p>Based on our unique experiences, we are convinced that behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices research and services delivery should be examined within a public health 
</p>
<p>framework. Such a framework includes an interdisciplinary and interprofessional 
</p>
<p>approach to studying behavioral health. Accordingly, the contributors to Foundations 
</p>
<p>of Behavioral Health include a variety of nationally prominent academicians, 
</p>
<p>researchers, and professionals. An important element of this text is that each chapter 
</p>
<p>contributor understands how their expert knowledge is a part of the broader public 
</p>
<p>health context in which their specialty exists.
</p>
<p>These national experts have made it possible to provide an integrated textbook 
</p>
<p>that can be used by graduate students in public health, behavioral health, social 
</p>
<p>work, psychiatric nursing, psychology, psychiatry, applied medical anthropology, 
</p>
<p>mental health counseling, criminology, medical sociology, and public administra-
</p>
<p>tion. In addition, we have also designed Foundations of Behavioral Health as a 
</p>
<p>reference and handbook for public health administrators, researchers, practitioners, 
</p>
<p>and policymakers who work with mental health issues at the local, state, and/or 
</p>
<p>national levels of the government.
</p>
<p> Organization of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Textbook
</p>
<p>Foundations of Behavioral Health is organized into three basic sections: (1) 
</p>
<p>Overview (issues), (2) At-Risk Populations, and (3) Services Delivery. The Overview 
</p>
<p>section of this textbook includes six chapters that provide information regarding the 
</p>
<p>defining characteristics of behavioral health. Chapter 1, written by the editors of this 
</p>
<p>volume, contains an introduction to behavioral health and examines social determi-
</p>
<p>nants of health and disease. In Chapter 2, Heslin provides a discussion of the epide-
</p>
<p>miology of behavioral health problems from a global perspective. In Chapter 3, 
</p>
<p>Timko and Cucciare provide an overview of the substance use disorders as well as 
</p>
<p>co-occurring disorders. Chapter 4, written by Samuel Zuvekas, discusses insurance 
</p>
<p>and financing of behavioral health services. In Chapter 5, Massey and Vroom dis-
</p>
<p>cuss the importance of implementation sciences in behavioral health. Finally, in 
</p>
<p>Chapter 6, the volume editors discuss the challenges of behavioral health services 
</p>
<p>research data.
</p>
<p>The second part of Foundations of Behavioral Health contains six chapters 
</p>
<p>exploring a variety of at-risk populations who are in need of behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices. In Chap. 7, Weist and associates examine the delivery of behavioral health 
</p>
<p>services to children and adolescents in school environments. Dembo and associates, 
</p>
<p>in Chapter&nbsp;8, discuss youth involved in juvenile justice systems in the United States. 
</p>
<p>Chapter&nbsp;9, written by Becker and Lynn, examines critical issues in women&rsquo;s behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health from an interdisciplinary public health perspective. In Chapter&nbsp; 10, 
</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xi
</p>
<p>Baldwin and associates discuss the challenges faced by the American Indian and 
</p>
<p>Alaskan native populations regarding behavioral health services. In Chapter 11, 
</p>
<p>Cohen and Krajewski review the prevalence and impact of behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices in older adult populations. Finally, in Chapter 12, Tasse and associates present 
</p>
<p>an overview of behavioral health services for persons with intellectual and develop-
</p>
<p>mental disabilities.
</p>
<p>The third major part of Foundations of Behavioral Health consists of five chap-
</p>
<p>ters on behavioral health services delivery. Chapter 13, written by Haack and associ-
</p>
<p>ates, presents a general overview and rationale for integrating health and behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services. The editors then present, in Chapter 14, the major issues in the 
</p>
<p>delivery of behavioral health services for individuals living in rural and frontier 
</p>
<p>areas. Chapter 15, written by Callejas and Hernandez, reframe the concept of cul-
</p>
<p>tural competence for the delivery of behavioral health services to culturally diverse 
</p>
<p>populations. In Chapter 16, Ott provides an overview of the role of pharmacy ser-
</p>
<p>vices in behavioral health. Finally, in Chapter&nbsp;17, the editors of this volume inte-
</p>
<p>grate the current trends in global behavioral health policy, systems, and services, 
</p>
<p>examining the magnitude of the problem, from definitional and operational perspec-
</p>
<p>tives, with a focus on child and adolescent behavioral health.
</p>
<p>As expected, it is impossible to include every possible topic in a single textbook 
</p>
<p>devoted to behavioral health services. Nevertheless, Foundations of Behavioral 
</p>
<p>Health emphasizes the critical importance of using an interdisciplinary public 
</p>
<p>health approach to understand behavioral health issues from a public health 
</p>
<p>framework.
</p>
<p>Throughout the development and preparation of this Foundations of Behavioral 
</p>
<p>Health textbook, there have been a number of individuals who have provided sage 
</p>
<p>counsel, continuing support, and/or significant encouragement. We would like to 
</p>
<p>extend our deep appreciation to Ms. Janet Kim of Springer for her many helpful 
</p>
<p>suggestions during the copyediting and production stages of this new textbook. 
</p>
<p>Finally, we are ultimately grateful to our families for their continuing love and 
</p>
<p>immeasurable support during the very lengthy preparation of this Foundations of 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health textbook.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>While the origins of epidemiology can be traced to John Snow and the 1854 cholera 
</p>
<p>outbreak in England (Snow, 1855), C-EA Winslow, in 1920, provided one of the 
</p>
<p>initial and most essential definitions of public health in the United States:
</p>
<p>Public health is the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting 
physical health and efficiency through organized community efforts&hellip; which will ensure to 
every individual a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health&hellip; to enable 
every citizen to realize his [and her] birthright of health and longevity. (Winslow, 1920, 
pp.&nbsp;6&ndash;7)
</p>
<p>More than a century later, the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s (IOM) Committee for the 
</p>
<p>Study of the Future of Public Health published the book The Future of Public 
</p>
<p>Health, which assessed public health programs and the coordination of services 
</p>
<p>across US government agencies and within state and local health departments. The 
</p>
<p>Committee defined the substance of public health as &ldquo;organized community efforts 
</p>
<p>aimed at the prevention of disease and promotion of health&rdquo; (Institute of Medicine, 
</p>
<p>1988, p.&nbsp;41). In addition, the Committee described the mission of public health as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;the fulfillment of society&rsquo;s interest in assuring conditions in which people can be 
</p>
<p>healthy&rdquo; (Institute of Medicine, 1988, p.&nbsp;40).

<p>The three core functions of public health are (1) assessment, (2) policy develop-
</p>
<p>ment, and (3) quality assurance (IOM, 1988), and the ten essential public health 
</p>
<p>services for these core public health functions (Public Health Functions Steering 
</p>
<p>Committee, 1994) are shown in Table&nbsp;1.
</p>
<p>More recently, there are a growing number of major initiatives in public health 
</p>
<p>which are of major importance nationally, including the integration of primary care 
</p>
<p>and public health (Institute of Medicine, 2012b), living well with chronic illness 
</p>
<p>(Institute of Medicine, 2012a), the social determinants of health (Stockman, 
</p>
<p>Hayashi, &amp; Campbell, 2015), women&rsquo;s behavioral health (National Academies of 
</p>
<p>Sciences, Engineering, &amp; Medicine, 2018b), and rural and frontier health (National 
</p>
<p>Academies of Sciences, Engineering, &amp; Medicine, 2018a).
</p>
<p>A population-based approach emphasizes health promotion and disease pre-
</p>
<p>vention. It also involves formal activities by both the public and private sectors, 
</p>
<p>working together to concentrate on sustaining the health of populations. This 
</p>
<p>public health framework of iterative problem-solving includes a select number of 
</p>
<p>phases, commencing with identification of the problem, assessing risks, and 
</p>
<p>ascertaining protective factors. The next stage includes the development, imple-
</p>
<p>mentation, and evaluation of interventions. The final phase in this iterative pro-
</p>
<p>cess is monitoring implementation in relation to the impact on policy and 
</p>
<p>cost-effectiveness.
</p>
<p>This first chapter highlights the concept of behavioral health within an overall 
</p>
<p>framework of population or public health. It examines the burden of behavioral 
</p>
<p>health problems on individuals, families, friends, and communities and the chal-
</p>
<p>lenges within existing behavioral health delivery systems. It also emphasizes the 
</p>
<p>importance of re-focusing behavioral health (the study of alcohol, drug abuse, and 
</p>
<p>mental disorders from a population or public health perspective) on systems integra-
</p>
<p>tion strategies, which incorporate technology, facilitate recovery, and promote

</p>
<p> Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>As we complete two decades of the twenty-first century, behavioral health problems 
</p>
<p>(i.e., behavioral disorders), continue to be significant public health problems. The 
</p>
<p>burden of disease from behavioral disorders is overwhelming and costly. The most 
</p>
<p>recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study ranked mental and substance use 
</p>
<p>disorders as the fifth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the 
</p>
<p>leading cause of years lived with a disability globally (Whiteford, Ferrari, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Degenhardt, 2016). Mental and substance use disorders globally account for nearly 
</p>
<p>one quarter of all years lived with a disability. In terms of lost economic output, the 
</p>
<p>World Economic Forum estimates the amount to be approximately $16 trillion in 
</p>
<p>US dollars over 20&nbsp;years or the equivalent of 25% of the 2010 global gross domestic 
</p>
<p>product (Bloom et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p>Globally, mental and substance use disorders are the leading cause of disability 
</p>
<p>in children and adolescents. Although approximately 50% of all mental disorders 
</p>
<p>develop by the age of 14, many individuals go untreated until adulthood (World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization, 2014a). In terms of DALYs, these disorders ranked as the sixth 
</p>
<p>leading cause of DALYs (5.7%, 55.5 million children), equivalent to 25% of all dis-
</p>
<p>abilities in children worldwide (Erskine et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p> The United States
</p>
<p>Among comparable countries, the United States not only has the highest rate of 
</p>
<p>death from mental and substance use disorders, but these disorders are the leading 
</p>
<p>cause of disease burden for females and the third leading cause of disease burden for 
</p>
<p>males (Murray et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p>Approximately one in five Americans (43 million) has a behavioral disorder dur-
</p>
<p>ing any given year, with anxiety disorders (e.g., phobias, panic disorder, and post- 
</p>
<p>traumatic stress disorder) found to be the most prevalent behavioral disorders in 
</p>
<p>adults. Of these 43 million, approximately ten million American adults (1&nbsp; in 25) 
</p>
<p>experience serious functional impairment due to mental or substance use disorders. 
</p>
<p>These disorders are the single largest source of DALYs in the United States, repre-
</p>
<p>senting nearly 14% of disability from all causes (Murray et&nbsp;al., 2013). These dis-
</p>
<p>abilities affect physical, social, and behavioral functioning across the lifespan.
</p>
<p>Approximately one in five children and adolescents (ages 9&ndash;17) in the United 
</p>
<p>States has a diagnosable behavioral disorder during any given year, with approxi-
</p>
<p>mately 11% of children experiencing significant functional impairment and 5% of 
</p>
<p>children experiencing extreme functional impairment (Adelman &amp; Taylor, 2010). In 
</p>
<p>Population-Based Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4
</p>
<p>addition, at any one time, between 10 and 15% of children and adolescents have 
</p>
<p>symptoms of depression. In 2015, a significant increase in the national annual prev-
</p>
<p>alence of major depressive episodes among adolescents aged 12&ndash;17 (8.2% in 2011 
</p>
<p>to 12.5% in 2015) was reported (SAMHSA, 2017). Substance use also increased. 
</p>
<p>An estimated 2.2 million (8.8%) of adolescents (12&ndash;17) use illicit drugs and 5.8% 
</p>
<p>of adolescents (an estimated 1.4 million adolescents) engaged in binge alcohol use 
</p>
<p>(SAMHSA, 2017).
</p>
<p> Financing of&nbsp;Care
</p>
<p>Behavioral health care in America have evolved into a complicated array of uncoor-
</p>
<p>dinated and fragmented services, programs, and delivery systems, often creating 
</p>
<p>significant problems in accessing needed services. The considerable gap between 
</p>
<p>epidemiologic estimates of behavioral disorders and the actual number of individu-
</p>
<p>als receiving care over the course of a lifetime strongly suggests many Americans 
</p>
<p>have attempted to cope with their behavioral health problems without seeking treat-
</p>
<p>ment. They do not seek help, do not enter formal behavioral health-care delivery 
</p>
<p>systems, or receive assistance through other health and/or social service systems, 
</p>
<p>including (primary) health care, welfare, correctional, pastoral counseling, or long- 
</p>
<p>term care delivery systems.
</p>
<p>In addition, the historical reliance on the public sector for long-term care and on 
</p>
<p>the private sector for acute care has contributed to the limited overall continuity of 
</p>
<p>care for behavioral health services. While state and federal governments historically 
</p>
<p>funded public behavioral health care, the financing systems for these services have 
</p>
<p>increasingly been mixed, involving a multitude of public and private payers and 
</p>
<p>providers of behavioral health care.
</p>
<p>Globally, the direct and indirect economic costs of mental disorders are esti-
</p>
<p>mated at approximately $2.5 trillion in the United States (Trautmann, Rehm, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Wittchen, 2016). The indirect costs, estimated at $1.7 trillion in the United States, 
</p>
<p>are more than double the direct costs ($0.8 trillion in the United States). This finding 
</p>
<p>is in direct contrast to the costs of care for other physical diseases, such as cardio-
</p>
<p>vascular diseases and cancer (Trautmann et&nbsp;al., 2016). In 2013, the United States 
</p>
<p>spent $201 billion on individuals with behavioral disorders in the general popula-
</p>
<p>tion, individuals who were institutionalized, and active-duty military populations 
</p>
<p>(Roehrig, 2016). In 2014, spending totaled $220 billion. Of this amount, mental 
</p>
<p>health spending amounted to $186 billion (85% of overall spending), and substance 
</p>
<p>use disorders spending amounted to $34 billion (15% of overall spending) 
</p>
<p>(SAMHSA, 2016). See chapter &ldquo;Financing of Behavioral Health Services: 
</p>
<p>Insurance, Managed Care, and Reimbursement&rdquo; in this volume for a more detailed 
</p>
<p>discussion on insurance, financing, and managed behavioral health care in the 
</p>
<p>United States.

</p>
<p> Burden of&nbsp;Behavioral Disorders
</p>
<p>In addition to the definition, substance, mission, and functions of public health in the 
</p>
<p>preceding discussion, public health may also be viewed within the larger context of 
</p>
<p>health. The World Health Organization not only defines health as &ldquo;a state of com-
</p>
<p>plete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease 
</p>
<p>or infirmity&rdquo;; it also affirms that &ldquo;enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
</p>
<p>health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of 
</p>
<p>race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition&rdquo; (World Health 
</p>
<p>Organization, 2006, p.&nbsp;11). Thus, behavioral health may be conceptualized as an 
</p>
<p>integral part of the overall health of individuals and populations, though different 
</p>
<p>cultures and ethnicities vary in their definitions of what constitutes behavioral health.
</p>
<p> Complexity of&nbsp;Systems
</p>
<p>State mental hospitals historically were the primary location for providing care for 
</p>
<p>people with serious behavioral health problems throughout the United States. With 
</p>
<p>the introduction of deinstitutionalization and community mental health centers in 
</p>
<p>America, these hospitals were downsized in terms of population and often eventu-
</p>
<p>ally closed. Largely independent from public health systems, publicly funded 
</p>
<p>behavioral health systems then developed into a variety of specialty (sector) ser-
</p>
<p>vices within a number of different organizational settings. Concerned about the con-
</p>
<p>tinued fragmentation and lack of integration between public health and behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services, the IOM Committee recommended the integration of health and 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services, with a primary focus on disease prevention and health 
</p>
<p>promotion (Institute of Medicine, 1988).
</p>
<p>The de facto behavioral health systems in the United States are comprised of 
</p>
<p>numerous behavioral health-care service components as well as social welfare, jus-
</p>
<p>tice, and educational systems across both public and private sector services. Each 
</p>
<p>sector exists in individual silos. Each has its own agencies, management, funding 
</p>
<p>streams, and services. These sectors provide acute and long-term services across a 
</p>
<p>variety of settings, including home-based, community-based, and institutionally 
</p>
<p>based. In addition, care is provided across the specialty behavioral health sector, the 
</p>
<p>general medical/primary care sector, and the voluntary care sector.
</p>
<p>Influences on how this care is provided, accessed, organized, delivered, and 
</p>
<p>financed come from professional licensing and accreditation organizations, man-
</p>
<p>aged care organizations, insurance companies, advocacy and regulatory agencies, 
</p>
<p>and health-care policymaking groups (see chapter &ldquo;Financing of Behavioral Health 
</p>
<p>Services: Insurance, Managed Care, and Reimbursement&rdquo; in this volume for a 
</p>
<p>detailed discussion of insurance and financing of behavioral health services). In 
</p>
<p>addition, other systems that provide behavioral health services may not have identi-
</p>
<p>Population-Based Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6
</p>
<p>fication of behavioral disorders as a primary mission and fail to link patients with 
</p>
<p>behavioral disorders to appropriate venues for care.
</p>
<p>The provision of mental health and substance abuse services in both jails and 
</p>
<p>prison serves as an example. The provision, utilization, and costs of these services 
</p>
<p>are not uniformly accepted across the United States. Continuum of care post parole, 
</p>
<p>probation, or reentry into the community is a common problem, as in a more 
</p>
<p>community- based orientation to treatment and supportive services (see chapter 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behavioral Health and the Juvenile Justice System&rdquo; in this volume for a more 
</p>
<p>detailed discussion of mental health treatment in juvenile justice settings).
</p>
<p>State and federal legislation, which influence the delivery of services, are often 
</p>
<p>in conflict with each other. Legislative proviso language, regulatory and administra-
</p>
<p>tive requirements, and financial appropriation language also affect the eventual 
</p>
<p>delivery of services, especially to vulnerable and underserved populations. Other 
</p>
<p>factors that influence delivery of care include new practice models, such as inte-
</p>
<p>grated health and behavioral health services, as well as increasingly hybridized pub-
</p>
<p>lic and private sector provider networks. However, the continuing challenge for 
</p>
<p>behavioral health is how to provide the best possible treatment, despite distinct ser-
</p>
<p>vice sectors, to improve the quality of life and long-term outcomes for persons with 
</p>
<p>mental and substance use disorders.
</p>
<p> System Transformation
</p>
<p>Of the five goals of the President&rsquo;s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health 
</p>
<p>(2003) to fundamentally transform the delivery of behavioral health services, tech-
</p>
<p>nology remains as one of today&rsquo;s main priorities.
</p>
<p>Technology is a critical factor in the delivery of care. Not only does it advance 
</p>
<p>research in the development of evidence-based practices; it also is an effective 
</p>
<p>e-channel in the diffusion, early adoption, and effective implementation of effica-
</p>
<p>cious and effective practices. With a focus on improving service delivery and utili-
</p>
<p>zation, the ultimate goal of technology, from a public behavioral health perspective, 
</p>
<p>is on disease prevention and health promotion. Technology also plays a significant 
</p>
<p>role in workforce development, as the integration of electronic health records now 
</p>
<p>include specific best practices and data for behavioral health treatment and practice. 
</p>
<p>It also develops and expands the behavioral health knowledge base, providing lon-
</p>
<p>gitudinal and comparative data to address disparities, trauma, acute care, and long- 
</p>
<p>term consequences of medications (see chapter &ldquo;Pharmacy Services in Behavioral 
</p>
<p>Health&rdquo; in this volume for more on pharmacology). Clearly, integrated information 
</p>
<p>technology (e.g., electronic health records) and communication infrastructure (e.g., 
</p>
<p>telehealth systems) are well worth the investment to improve the delivery of care 
</p>
<p>across underserved and vulnerable populations.
</p>
<p>In March of 2019, in what seems very hard to fathom, the Internet turned 30&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>old. Since its inception, traditional communications media has transformed into 
</p>
<p>remarkable technologic initiatives and amazing available hardware and software.

</p>
<p>The emergence of simple machine transmission protocol, voice over Internet 
</p>
<p>Protocol (VoIP), and Internet Protocol television (IPTV) have radically changed 
</p>
<p>how we communicate, with streaming media, podcasting, and real-time webcams. 
</p>
<p>Social media changes almost daily, with new mobile applications and platforms. 
</p>
<p>The availability of platforms has also resulted in many organizations, no matter how 
</p>
<p>large or small, having as well as using social media accounts to get their message 
</p>
<p>out to the public.
</p>
<p>Media advocacy plays a significant role in setting public agenda and influencing 
</p>
<p>the direction of public opinion on health, behavioral health, and social issues. 
</p>
<p>Agenda setting may (1) establish the importance of a topic for the public and/or (2) 
</p>
<p>address what the public should think about a topic. Media stories often are coded 
</p>
<p>and identified with an episodic or a thematic frame. Episodic frames focus on dis-
</p>
<p>crete events, people, and places; however, they often provide the least amount of 
</p>
<p>statistical or contextual information, which would better inform the public. Thematic 
</p>
<p>frames focus on contextualizing the issue within a broader framework. These frames 
</p>
<p>work much better from an informational and sense-making perspective, especially 
</p>
<p>when looking at rapid dissemination and discussion of research results.
</p>
<p>Respondents to a survey by the National Collaborating Centre for Determinants of 
</p>
<p>Health reported that social media played an important role in public health (Ndumbe-
</p>
<p>Eyoh &amp; Mazzucco, 2016). Respondents used social media to report and address 
</p>
<p>health inequities, discuss effective strategies to improve services delivery, and par-
</p>
<p>ticipate in policy analysis and advocacy (Ndumbe-Eyoh &amp; Mazzucco, 2016). While 
</p>
<p>organizational and government websites are more often seen as a primary and author-
</p>
<p>itative source of information, social media is increasingly seen as a close second.
</p>
<p>A systematic review on the use of social media in public health and health pro-
</p>
<p>motion had mixed reviews on the effectiveness of social media to improve health

<p>outcomes or increase health equity. Welch et&nbsp; al. (2016) found that some social 
</p>
<p>media interventions may be effective for selected at-risk populations (age, socioeco-
</p>
<p>nomic status, ethnicities, and place of residence). However, the lack of consistency 
</p>
<p>in the design and implementation of social media interventions, in some cases, 
</p>
<p>resulted in no change or worsened outcomes in study participants. In addition, pri-
</p>
<p>vacy, confidentiality, and appropriateness of &ldquo;fit&rdquo; of intervention with populations 
</p>
<p>were identified as significant challenges (Welch et&nbsp;al., 2016).

<p> Social Determinants of&nbsp;Health, Sustainable Development 
</p>
<p>Goals, and&nbsp;Healthy People
</p>
<p>Since 2003, research continues to show how a small number of health risks account 
</p>
<p>for the majority of the morbidity and mortality associated with disease, disability, 
</p>
<p>and death. Although the top ten global health risks, which account for more than one 
</p>
<p>third of all deaths, continue to change, the top ten health risks still account for the 
</p>
<p>majority of deaths. The literature also suggests risk factors potentially can be 
</p>
<p>reversed and that addressing these risk factors could also reduce societal inequities.

<p>The Grand Challenges in the Global Mental Health Initiative identified mental, 
</p>
<p>neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders as being within its scope (i.e., 
</p>
<p>depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, alcohol and drug 
</p>
<p>use disorders, mental disorders of childhood, migraines, dementias, and epilepsy) 
</p>
<p>(Collins et&nbsp; al., 2011). In addition, the Grand Challenges in the Global Mental 
</p>
<p>Health Initiative defined &ldquo;global&rdquo; to include cross-national influences on mental 
</p>
<p>health, such as climate change or macroeconomic policies. Its goals are to (1) 
</p>
<p>identify root causes, risk, and protective factors; (2) advance prevention and 
</p>
<p>implementation of early interventions; (3) improve treatments and expand access 
</p>
<p>to care; (4) raise awareness of the global burden; (5) build human resource capac-
</p>
<p>ity; and (6) transform health systems and policy responses. Each of its goals listed 
</p>
<p>the top challenges for its area and provided a list of possible research questions 
</p>
<p>(Collins et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p> Social Determinants of&nbsp;Health
</p>
<p>Predating the Grand Challenges in the Global Mental Health Initiative, however, 
</p>
<p>was the social determinants of health framework. Published in 1998 by the World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization (WHO), as a response to the Health for All (HFA) policy on 
</p>
<p>Europe, WHO focused on the effects on population health caused by the follow-
</p>
<p>ing areas: social and economic status, stress, early life, social exclusion, work, 
</p>
<p>unemployment, social support, addiction, food, and transport (Wilkinson &amp; 
</p>
<p>Marmot, 1998). Tying together environmental, socioeconomic, political, cul-
</p>
<p>tural, and infrastructure influences on health was a continued global health 
</p>
<p>emphasis through the decades, with successive reports building an evidence-
</p>
<p>based practice, determining how to evaluate progress, and creating a global con-
</p>
<p>sensus (De Castro Freire, Manoncourt, &amp; Mukhopadhyay, 2009; Kelly et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2007; Ollila, 2011; World Health Assembly, 2009, 2011; World Health 
</p>
<p>Organization, 2014b, 2016).
</p>
<p> Sustainable Development Goals
</p>
<p>The Millennium Development Goals (MDG), adopted by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>General Assembly and WHO, had 8 goals with 21 targets, with a series of measur-
</p>
<p>able health indicators and economic indicators for each target (United Nations 
</p>
<p>General Assembly, 2000). The MDG resulted in numerous global and regional 
</p>
<p>reports on existing infrastructures, policies, and population needs (Beattie, Brown, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Cass, 2015; Stuckler, Basu, &amp; McKee, 2010; Thomsen et&nbsp;al., 2013; World Health 
</p>
<p>Organization, 2010).

</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, the United Nations General Assembly (2015) adopted its 
</p>
<p>2030 Development Agenda entitled &ldquo;Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda 
</p>
<p>for Sustainable Development.&rdquo; The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) encom-
</p>
<p>pass 17 global goals, with 169 targets, which address social and economic develop-
</p>
<p>ment issues including poverty, hunger, health, education, global warming, gender 
</p>
<p>equality, water, sanitation, energy, urbanization, environment, and social justice 
</p>
<p>(Sustainable Development Solutions Network, 2015; World Health Organization, 
</p>
<p>2017). One major difference between the MDG and the SDG is their approaches. 
</p>
<p>The MDG identified an individual goal and focused on addressing its effects, while 
</p>
<p>the SDG emphasizes the interrelatedness of each of its goals to the other and 
</p>
<p>attempts to deal with the causes of the problem.
</p>
<p>The United States incorporated the WHO&rsquo;s definition of health in its Healthy 
</p>
<p>People initiatives, which address national 10-year plans with identified objectives 
</p>
<p>and indicators for improving the health of Americans. Healthy People addresses 
</p>
<p>four main areas, (1) general health status, (2) health-related quality of life and well- 
</p>
<p>being, (3) the social determinants of health, and (4) health disparities, with a focus 
</p>
<p>on both individual-level and population-level determinants of health and interven-
</p>
<p>tions. Much like the SDG, Healthy People examines the relationship between health 
</p>
<p>status and biology, individual behavior, health services, social factors, and policies 
</p>
<p>(Secretary&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on National Health Promotion and Disease 
</p>
<p>Prevention Objectives for 2030, 2018).
</p>
<p> Healthy People
</p>
<p>Healthy People&rsquo;s 2020 national objectives firmly embed behavioral health practice 
</p>
<p>and practitioners into its national goals. Within the topic &ldquo;Mental Health and Mental 
</p>
<p>Disorders,&rdquo; the primary objectives are mental health status improvement and treat-
</p>
<p>ment expansion. However, across other topics, such as &ldquo;Disability and Health,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Substance Abuse,&rdquo; &ldquo;Educational and Community-Based Programs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Social 
</p>
<p>Determinants of Health&rdquo; (to name just a few), components of behavioral health are 
</p>
<p>also found.
</p>
<p>For Healthy People 2030, the Secretary&rsquo;s Advisory Committee (2018) set as one 
</p>
<p>of its priorities the inclusion of the social determinants of health (SDH) as a 
</p>
<p> crosscutting theme, maintaining the SDH as a separate topic area and applying SDH 
</p>
<p>as a selection criteria for topic objectives. In addition, the focus is (1) reducing 
</p>
<p>deaths, (2) reducing morbidity, (3) reducing disability, (4) reducing health disparity 
</p>
<p>while increasing health equity, and (5) increasing well-being. Objectives cover three 
</p>
<p>types: (1) core, (2) developmental, and (3) research.
</p>
<p>Finally, each objective is viewed vis-&agrave;-vis its public health burden, the magni-
</p>
<p>tude of the health disparity, the degree to which health equity would be achieved if 
</p>
<p>the target were met, the degree to whether the objective is a sentinel or bellwether 
</p>
<p>indicator, and, finally, the actionability of the objective.

</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>A population approach to behavioral health focuses on health promotion and 
</p>
<p>disease prevention to improve the health and mental health of populations. 
</p>
<p>Foundations Behavioral Health uses a public health framework to examine 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services and delivery issues in the United States as well as 
</p>
<p>from a global perspective. The six chapters in the first section of the volume 
</p>
<p>address an overview of basic issues in behavioral health services. The second 
</p>
<p>section of the volume presents chapters examining the development of effective 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services in specific at-risk populations. Finally, the last five 
</p>
<p>chapters in the third section of this volume present critical issues in the delivery 
</p>
<p>of behavioral health services.
</p>
<p>There are significant consequences for failing to treat behavioral disorders, from 
</p>
<p>a developmental or lifespan perspective, affecting children as they age into adoles-
</p>
<p>cence, adulthood, and old age. The societal effects are devastating, in terms of years 
</p>
<p>of life lived with a disability, increased morbidity and mortality, and the burden of 
</p>
<p>disease on individuals, families, and communities.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a public health perspective allows one to examine and address the 
</p>
<p>continued fragmentation and gaps in the care for children, adults, and the elderly; 
</p>
<p>recovery issues surrounding unemployment, stigma, and disability for people with 
</p>
<p>serious behavioral disorders; and the lack of a national priority for behavioral health 
</p>
<p>and suicide prevention.
</p>
<p>National initiatives, such as the President&rsquo;s New Freedom Commission (2003) 
</p>
<p>and the Obama Administration&rsquo;s focus on reducing stigma, access to care, and the 
</p>
<p>real possibility of recovery, show a paradigm shift from a &ldquo;wicked problem,&rdquo; i.e., 
</p>
<p>challenging and complex issues (Rittel &amp; Martin, 1973), to an inclusive, community- 
</p>
<p>centered approach.

<p>The Global Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental 
and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders
</p>
<p>Kevin&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Heslin
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Mental and substance use disorders (MSUD) are a major cause of disability worldwide. 
</p>
<p>In 2017, depressive disorders were the third leading cause of years lived with disability, 
</p>
<p>ranking higher than 351 other diseases and injuries assessed for 195 countries and ter-
</p>
<p>ritories (GBD 2017 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2018). 
</p>
<p>Globally, an estimated 12.9% of the world&rsquo;s population had a mental disorder in 2017 
</p>
<p>(Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2018). By identifying countries with both 
</p>
<p>a high burden of mental illness and relatively scarce treatment resources, multinational 
</p>
<p>studies can inform decisions on technical support and assistance by specialized agen-
</p>
<p>cies such as the World Health Organization (WHO). From a public health perspective, 
</p>
<p>cross-national comparisons may also elucidate the links between mental illness and the 
</p>
<p>multiplicity of circumstances in which people around the world are born, grow up, live, 
</p>
<p>work, and grow older, as well as the different systems of care that are available to deal 
</p>
<p>with their illnesses over the course of their lives (WHO, 2008).
</p>
<p>Multinational research on the epidemiology of MSUD can provide more than com-
</p>
<p>parisons between discrete geographic areas. As countries become increasingly con-
</p>
<p>nected and interdependent, such studies may also show how population mental health 
</p>
<p>is related to the movement of people, goods, information, and ideas across borders. 
</p>
<p>Increasing activity between countries through trade, investment, and migration, often 
</p>
<p>referred to as indicators of the process of &ldquo;globalization,&rdquo; may have consequences for

</p>
<p>population mental health by facilitating the exposure to new risk and protective fac-
</p>
<p>tors, the diffusion of innovative treatments, and the exchange of health-related infor-
</p>
<p>mation (Deaton, 2015). For example, expanding markets for Western entertainment 
</p>
<p>media and its promulgation of thin body-type ideals have likely contributed to the rise 
</p>
<p>of eating disorders among young women in Africa (Eddy, Hennessey, &amp; Thompson-
</p>
<p>Brenner, 2007) and Asian region countries (Pike &amp; Dunne, 2015) in recent years.
</p>
<p>Globally, the number of people seeking refuge from life-threatening circum-
</p>
<p>stances in their countries of origin is the highest it has been since the early 1990s, at 
</p>
<p>21.3 million (Betts &amp; Collier, 2017). Trauma-related disorders among refugees can 
</p>
<p>be exacerbated by a range of adverse resettlement experiences in destination coun-
</p>
<p>tries (Kinzie, 2007; Kirmayer, Lemelson, &amp; Barad, 2007), from encounters with 
</p>
<p>unfamiliar cultural practices to inhuman treatment in immigration detention centers 
</p>
<p>and the forced separation of family members (U.S.&nbsp; Department of Homeland 
</p>
<p>Security, 2017; Zucker &amp; Greene, 2018).
</p>
<p>International trade agreements can affect the availability and affordability of phar-
</p>
<p>maceuticals within countries. In the past, public officials have been compelled during 
</p>
<p>trade negotiations to reform national policies on pharmaceutical marketing and pric-
</p>
<p>ing. For example, the USA has used trade talks to promote the removal of restrictions 
</p>
<p>on direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals in Australia and South Korea 
</p>
<p>(Gleeson &amp; Menkes, 2017), as well as the elimination of cost- containment measures 
</p>
<p>such as therapeutic reference pricing in New Zealand (Gleeson, Lopert, &amp; Reid, 
</p>
<p>2013). Because the availability of new psychopharmaceuticals and other treatments 
</p>
<p>has often led to increases in the diagnosis of mental disorders that are appropriate for 
</p>
<p>those treatments (Oppenheimer, 2014), this aspect of international trade could con-
</p>
<p>ceivably affect how frequently disorders are identified and treated. Repeated epide-
</p>
<p>miologic surveys have the potential to detect the impacts of evolving international 
</p>
<p>trade relations on population mental health, as they are mediated through changes in 
</p>
<p>policies affecting the accessibility and affordability of pharmaceuticals.
</p>
<p>These developments provide the context for this overview of the global epidemi-
</p>
<p>ology of MSUD.&nbsp; The chapter reviews selected findings from the WHO World 
</p>
<p>Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative and several other data sources on the prev-
</p>
<p>alence and incidence of schizophrenia and psychotic-like experiences, depressive 
</p>
<p>disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating disor-
</p>
<p>ders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), personality disorders, and 
</p>
<p>SUD.&nbsp;The chapter concludes with a review of the contribution of the epidemiology 
</p>
<p>of MSUD to national mental health policy-making and a consideration of its poten-
</p>
<p>tial to inform the work of international human rights organizations.
</p>
<p> The World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health 
</p>
<p>(WMH) Survey Initiative
</p>
<p>The global statistics reviewed in this chapter are drawn largely from articles based 
</p>
<p>on the WMH Survey Initiative, a cross-national epidemiologic research consortium 
</p>
<p>of nationally or regionally representative surveys in 28 countries classified by the 
</p>
<p>K. C. Heslin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17
</p>
<p>World Bank income categories (World Bank, 2018). Using standardized survey 
</p>
<p>measures, disorder classification systems, and field procedures in face-to-face inter-
</p>
<p>views, the WMH Survey Initiative represents the largest and most systematic effort 
</p>
<p>to date to minimize the methodologic limitations of previous cross-national studies 
</p>
<p>(Fayyad et&nbsp; al., 2017; Kessler &amp; Ustun, 2004). In each participating country, the 
</p>
<p>WMH Survey Initiative assessed the presence of MSUD as defined by the Diagnostic 
</p>
<p>and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition (American 
</p>
<p>Psychiatric Association, 2013), using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic 
</p>
<p>Interview (CIDI) (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2004). Methodologically, this coordinated approach 
</p>
<p>has distinct advantages over the WHO Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies, 
</p>
<p>which draw largely from epidemiologic literature reviews and relatively isolated 
</p>
<p>national studies (World Health Organization, 2005b).
</p>
<p>In making cross-national comparisons, several features of the WMH Survey 
</p>
<p>Initiative and other international studies should be kept in mind. Kessler et&nbsp;al. have 
</p>
<p>acknowledged concerns about the cross-cultural validity of research diagnostic 
</p>
<p>instruments such as the CIDI, noting that estimates of the prevalence of some disor-
</p>
<p>ders in developing countries are questionably low (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2004; Kessler &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ustun, 2004; Kessler, Alonso, Chatterji, &amp; He, 2014). It is possible that the social, 
</p>
<p>religious, and/or legal contexts of some countries reduce the willingness of survey 
</p>
<p>respondents to report thoughts, feelings, and behaviors potentially indicative of 
</p>
<p>mental disorders or the use of substances (Degenhardt et&nbsp;al., 2017). Indeed, local 
</p>
<p>cultural norms could influence whether psychiatric symptoms are even experienced 
</p>
<p>in psychological or emotional terms, which could in turn affect whether respondents 
</p>
<p>endorse the symptom descriptions included in survey instruments (Bhugra &amp; 
</p>
<p>Mastrogianni, 2004).
</p>
<p>It is important to note that unexpected findings on the use of mental health spe-
</p>
<p>cialty services by apparent non-cases in some WMH Survey Initiative studies may 
</p>
<p>actually reflect appropriate service use by individuals with subthreshold symptoms 
</p>
<p>or with disorders not assessed by the CIDI (Wang et&nbsp;al., 2007). Finally, country- 
</p>
<p>level response rates in the WMH Survey Initiative varied widely, from 45.9% in 
</p>
<p>France to 97.2% in the Medellin metropolitan area of Colombia. Cross-national 
</p>
<p>comparisons could be biased to the extent that survey response rates are related to 
</p>
<p>the prevalence of MSUD and service use, although the weighting of data by popula-
</p>
<p>tion sociodemographic distributions should reduce that bias in the final estimates 
</p>
<p>(Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2010; Wang et&nbsp;al., 2007). In the next sections, the author will exam-
</p>
<p>ine the descriptive epidemiology of a number of MSUD through a review of studies 
</p>
<p>from the WMH Survey Initiative, the GBD studies, and several other data sources.
</p>
<p> Schizophrenia and&nbsp;Psychotic-Like Experiences
</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by the three main symptom 
</p>
<p>domains of delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behavior, with a 
</p>
<p>typical age of onset in late adolescence or early adulthood. Schizophrenia is

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18
</p>
<p>relatively rare, and the costs of finding cases through population-based surveys are 
</p>
<p>prohibitive. If the true prevalence of schizophrenia was 0.5% in the population, 
</p>
<p>prevalence estimates for three age groups by two gender groups, with 30 respon-
</p>
<p>dents in the numerator of each of the resulting six cells, would require that 36,000 
</p>
<p>individuals be interviewed (Eaton, Chen, &amp; Bromet, 2011).
</p>
<p>Probably the most credible information on the epidemiology of schizophrenia 
</p>
<p>comes from population-based registers that draw data from inpatient and outpatient 
</p>
<p>facilities for an entire country, in which treatment for schizophrenia and other health 
</p>
<p>conditions is free of charge. For example, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research 
</p>
<p>Register contains information on every psychiatric admission since 1970, as well as 
</p>
<p>outpatient treatment and emergency room contacts since 1995 (Mors, Perto, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Mortensen, 2011). The register contains unique identification numbers that permit 
</p>
<p>linkages to the Danish Civil Registration System, an administrative register that con-
</p>
<p>tains individual-level data on all persons residing in Denmark, with updates on 
</p>
<p>migration, births, and deaths made on a daily basis (Schmidt, Pedersen, &amp; Sorensen, 
</p>
<p>2014). All Danish residents are required to notify the Danish authorities of changes 
</p>
<p>in address, both within the country and when moving to or returning from another 
</p>
<p>country. These daily updates on migration and vital status permit the calculation of 
</p>
<p>person-time at risk for the denominators of incidence rates in epidemiologic studies.
</p>
<p>Linking records from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register and the Danish 
</p>
<p>Civil Registration System, Thorup, Waltoft, Pedersen, Mortensen, and Norderntoft 
</p>
<p>(2007) used data on all individuals born in Denmark between 1934 and 1990 to 
</p>
<p>estimate age- and gender-specific incidence rates of schizophrenia from ages 15 to 
</p>
<p>72 (Thorup et&nbsp;al., 2007). Both men and women had peak incidence rates at ages 22 
</p>
<p>and 23, although the rate for men at that age was twice as high as that for women 
</p>
<p>(approximately 80 and 40 incident cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively). 
</p>
<p>With increasing age, however, the direction of this gender difference reversed. 
</p>
<p>Whereas men had significantly higher incidence rates in the age range of 17&ndash;40&nbsp;years, 
</p>
<p>women had higher rates in the 50-to-68-year-old age range. Comparing cumulative 
</p>
<p>incidence, i.e., the percentage of all people who had received a diagnosis up to a 
</p>
<p>given age, rates were higher for men than women at all ages. By age 72, cumulative 
</p>
<p>incidence was approximately 35% higher among men than woman (1.59% and 
</p>
<p>1.17%, respectively).
</p>
<p>Increasingly, schizophrenia is viewed as a neurodevelopmental disorder influ-
</p>
<p>enced by an array of environmental risk factors that can affect the brain during early 
</p>
<p>development, including prenatal influenza exposure, obstetric complications, and 
</p>
<p>maternal and intrauterine nutritional deficiencies (McGrath, Feron, Burne, Mackay- 
</p>
<p>Sim, &amp; Eyles, 2003; McGrath, Nunes, &amp; Quitkin, 2003). Given the heterogeneity of 
</p>
<p>these environmental risks, it is not surprising the literature shows considerable vari-
</p>
<p>ation in prevalence and incidence estimates globally. Saha, Chant, Welham, and 
</p>
<p>McGrath (2005) reviewed estimates of the prevalence of schizophrenia from 188 
</p>
<p>studies published between 1965 and 2002, based on data from 46 countries. The 
</p>
<p>mean lifetime prevalence estimate across all countries was 0.43%, with variation by 
</p>
<p>country ranging from 0.18% in the 10th percentile of estimates to 1.16% in the 90th 
</p>
<p>percentile (Saha et&nbsp;al., 2005).

</p>
<p>The study of environmental risk factors for schizophrenia has focused mainly on 
</p>
<p>in utero exposures that could affect the developing brain. However, a variety of 
</p>
<p>stressors throughout the life course can precipitate the onset of schizophrenia in 
</p>
<p>vulnerable individuals. For example, refugees fleeing war, genocide, and other life- 
</p>
<p>threatening circumstances in their countries of origin are at greater risk of mental 
</p>
<p>disorders, including schizophrenia. A Swedish population registry-based study of 
</p>
<p>post-migration onset of schizophrenia and other psychoses among refugee and non- 
</p>
<p>refugee immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia, the 
</p>
<p>Middle East, and North Africa was conducted by Hollander et&nbsp; al. (2016). They 
</p>
<p>found that, compared with non-refugee immigrants, refugees had more than 60% 
</p>
<p>greater risk of first-onset schizophrenia over the study follow-up period, in models 
</p>
<p>accounting for age, sex, income, and residential population density (Hollander 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2016). It is important to note that increased prevalence of schizophrenia 
</p>
<p>among migrants compared with nonmigrants may also be related to selective migra-
</p>
<p>tion, i.e., the greater tendency for individuals with an existing predisposition or 
</p>
<p>vulnerability to a mental disorder to migrate (Morgan, Charalambides, Hutchinson, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Murray, 2010). However, the need to flee life-threatening circumstances seems a 
</p>
<p>more plausible explanation for the &ldquo;selective&rdquo; migration of refugees than does a 
</p>
<p>pre-migration disposition to mental disorder.
</p>
<p>Although schizophrenia is a low-prevalence disorder, it was ranked as the 12th 
</p>
<p>most disabling condition in a list of 333 diseases and injuries in the GBD Study of 
</p>
<p>2016, a meta-analysis that generated age-standardized prevalence estimates of the 
</p>
<p>disorder globally, as well as by region and country (GBD 2016 Disease and Injury 
</p>
<p>Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2017). Regionally, the highest age- 
</p>
<p>standardized point prevalence was in the East Asian countries of China, North Korea, 
</p>
<p>and Taiwan (0.42%). Investigating potential causes of the higher prevalence of 
</p>
<p>schizophrenia in China, one study estimated the cumulative risk for the disorder 
</p>
<p>among the cohort of individuals who would have been in utero in Anhui province at 
</p>
<p>the time of the Great Chinese Famine of 1959&ndash;1961. For the cohort of live births from 
</p>
<p>the famine years of 1960 and 1961, the cumulative risk of adult schizophrenia was 
</p>
<p>twice as high as it was for those born in the period immediately before (1956&ndash;1958) 
</p>
<p>and after (1962&ndash;1965) the famine, thus supporting the hypothesis that intrauterine 
</p>
<p>nutritional deficiency increases the risk of schizophrenia (St Clair et&nbsp;al., 2005).
</p>
<p>Gender differences in schizophrenia have been documented extensively. In the 
</p>
<p>review by Saha et&nbsp;al. (2005), mean lifetime prevalence for men was approximately 
</p>
<p>8% higher than that for women (0.37% vs. 0.34%, respectively). By contrast, the 
</p>
<p>incidence of schizophrenia was approximately 40% higher among men than 
</p>
<p>women&mdash;with mean rates, respectively, of 16.2 vs. 11.3 per 100,000 population 
</p>
<p>(Saha et&nbsp;al., 2005). It is possible that clinicians and psychiatric researchers overdi-
</p>
<p>agnose schizophrenia in men at first contact, thereby biasing upward incidence esti-
</p>
<p>mates among men (Guloksuz &amp; van Os, 2018). Alternatively, the greater gender 
</p>
<p>difference in incidence than lifetime prevalence estimates could reflect either better 
</p>
<p>outcomes or greater illness-related mortality among men; that is, men may exit the 
</p>
<p>population of people with schizophrenia faster than do women through either remis-
</p>
<p>sion or earlier death, which would decrease prevalence for men. However, a review 
</p>
<p>The Global Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20
</p>
<p>of studies in developing countries found only mixed support for systematic differ-
</p>
<p>ences in schizophrenia outcomes by gender. For example, studies in India and 
</p>
<p>Ethiopia found that the course and outcomes of schizophrenia were better for 
</p>
<p>women than men, whereas men in Colombia and Nigeria tended to have better out-
</p>
<p>comes than women (Cohen, Patel, Thara, &amp; Gureje, 2008).
</p>
<p>Gender comparisons of first-onset schizophrenia based on historical data are fur-
</p>
<p>ther complicated by modifications in diagnostic classification systems over time. 
</p>
<p>Specifically, an age exclusion limiting the diagnosis of schizophrenia to individuals 
</p>
<p>with first onset before age 45 was included in the DSM-III in 1980. Because of the 
</p>
<p>well-replicated observation that men have an earlier age of onset of schizophrenia 
</p>
<p>than do women, this age exclusion contributed to an excess of cases among men in 
</p>
<p>lifetime prevalence estimates (Castle, Wessely, &amp; Murray, 1993). By 1987, the 
</p>
<p>DSM-III-R had removed this age exclusion while adding a new exclusion for 
</p>
<p>patients with nonbizarre delusions without hallucinations&mdash;a change that was 
</p>
<p>shown in one study to reduce the number of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia 
</p>
<p>by 10% (Fenton, McGlashan, &amp; Heinssen, 1988). Historically, concerns about the 
</p>
<p>effects of diagnostic criteria on estimates of the incidence and prevalence of schizo-
</p>
<p>phrenia (overall and by gender) have not been limited to the DSM but have also 
</p>
<p>included the Research Diagnostic Criteria, Schneider&rsquo;s First-Rank Symptoms, and 
</p>
<p>other classification systems (Lewine, Burbach, &amp; Meltzer, 1984).
</p>
<p> Psychotic-Like Experiences
</p>
<p>As a discrete diagnostic entity, schizophrenia increasingly is regarded in the litera-
</p>
<p>ture as the only most severe, chronically debilitating endpoint of a broad spectrum 
</p>
<p>of psychotic disorders. This includes schizophreniform disorder, delusional disor-
</p>
<p>der, brief psychotic disorder, and&mdash;at the least severe end of the spectrum&mdash;a vari-
</p>
<p>ety of psychotic-like experiences that do not necessarily indicate an underlying 
</p>
<p>psychotic disorder (Guloksuz &amp; van Os, 2018; Perala et&nbsp;al., 2007).
</p>
<p>Although the scientific validity and clinical utility of the concept of a psychosis 
</p>
<p>spectrum is a matter of ongoing debate, a number of epidemiologic studies have 
</p>
<p>examined psychotic-like experiences and symptoms as points on a continuum rather 
</p>
<p>than as indicators of discrete, mutually exclusive diagnostic categories (David, 2010; 
</p>
<p>Kendler, Gallagher, Abelson, &amp; Kessler, 1996; Lawrie, Hall, McIntosh, Owens, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Johnstone, 2010; McGrath et&nbsp;al., 2017; Nuevo et&nbsp;al., 2012; van Os, Hanssen, Bijl, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ravelli, 2000). Psychotic-like experiences are apparently not rare, and their preva-
</p>
<p>lence varies geographically, according to several cross-national studies.
</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia found no major 
</p>
<p>cross-national differences in the prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychotic 
</p>
<p>disorders across nine countries, but there was wide variation in the percentage of 
</p>
<p>respondents reporting specific psychotic-like experiences. For example, auditory 
</p>
<p>hallucinations had a prevalence of 9% in Washington, DC, and 46% in Cali, 
</p>
<p>Colombia, whereas delusions had a prevalence of 11% in Moscow and 24% in

</p>
<p>Taipei (International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia &amp; World Health Organization, 
</p>
<p>1973; Sartorius, Shapiro, Kimura, &amp; Barrett, 1972). More recently, Nuevo et&nbsp; al. 
</p>
<p>(2012) reported variations across 52 countries in the prevalence of four separate 
</p>
<p>psychotic-like experiences (delusional mood, delusions of reference and persecu-
</p>
<p>tion, delusions of control, and visual and auditory hallucinations). Overall, 11.4% of 
</p>
<p>study participants with no lifetime history of schizophrenia reported having had at 
</p>
<p>least one of these experiences in the 12&nbsp;months before the interview, reaching as 
</p>
<p>high as 16.3% in South Africa among the high-/upper-middle-income countries and 
</p>
<p>45.8% in Nepal among the low-/lower-middle-income countries.
</p>
<p>Schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses were not assessed in the WMH 
</p>
<p>Survey Initiative because results from validation studies suggested that these condi-
</p>
<p>tions have been overestimated in layperson interviews (Wang et&nbsp;al., 2007). However, 
</p>
<p>data on psychotic-like experiences were collected that provided important informa-
</p>
<p>tion on the association of these phenomena with histories of childhood adversity 
</p>
<p>and abuse. McGrath et&nbsp;al. (2017) found that among seven types of adverse child-
</p>
<p>hood experiences related to maladaptive family functioning, childhood sexual abuse 
</p>
<p>had the strongest independent association with subsequent onset of psychotic-like 
</p>
<p>experiences during childhood (4&ndash;12&nbsp;years old). Childhood sexual abuse was also 
</p>
<p>associated with onset of psychotic experiences in adolescence (13&ndash;19&nbsp;years old) 
</p>
<p>and later adulthood (30&nbsp;years and older).
</p>
<p> Depressive Disorders
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;depression&rdquo; is used to refer to a wide range of mental states that are often 
</p>
<p>self-limiting and do not require professional attention. To establish the diagnosis of 
</p>
<p>major depressive disorder (MDD), five of nine symptoms, one of which must be 
</p>
<p>depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, must be present during the same 
</p>
<p>2-week period (APA, 2013). The GBD Study reported a 4.4% worldwide prevalence 
</p>
<p>of depressive disorders in 2015 (WHO, 2017). A 2017 study based on WMH Survey 
</p>
<p>Initiative data from 21 countries reported a 4.6% estimate for 12-month prevalence 
</p>
<p>of MDD (Thornicroft et&nbsp;al., 2017). This is closer to the GBD Study estimate (WHO, 
</p>
<p>2017) than an earlier WMH Survey Initiative article reporting a 12-month MDD 
</p>
<p>prevalence of 5.5% in ten developed countries and 5.9% in seven developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p> Use of&nbsp;Services
</p>
<p>Major depressive disorder often begins in youth or middle age, and the resulting 
</p>
<p>economic losses because of impairments in work, school, and other aspects of role 
</p>
<p>functioning have made the accessibility and affordability of high-quality mental 
</p>
<p>health services a critical public policy concern for developed and developing 
</p>

</p>
<p>countries alike (Wells, Sturm, Sherbourne, &amp; Meredith, 1999). The WMH Survey 
</p>
<p>Initiative found the use of mental health services by people with MDD shows wide 
</p>
<p>cross-national variation. The percentage of people with MDD in the previous 
</p>
<p>12&nbsp;months who received any type of MDD treatment ranged from 5.9% in China to 
</p>
<p>33.2% in Peru among low-/middle-income countries and from 20.2% in Italy to 
</p>
<p>61.8% in Spain among high-income countries. Comparing all low-/middle-income 
</p>
<p>countries with all high-income countries, the percentage of individuals with MDD 
</p>
<p>receiving specific types of treatment was, respectively, 11.2% versus 22.6% for spe-
</p>
<p>cialty psychiatric services, 8.6% versus 29.6% for general medical services, and 
</p>
<p>4.6% versus 7.4% for nonmedical services (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p>A major barrier to the use of services for MDD is a lack of recognition of the 
</p>
<p>need for treatment by affected individuals, which could in turn influence how symp-
</p>
<p>toms are communicated to others who might be in a position to facilitate the use of 
</p>
<p>services (Hanlon, Fekadu, &amp; Patel, 2014). In a study of 12-month MDD from the 
</p>
<p>WMH Survey Initiative, only one out of every three affected people (34.6%) in 
</p>
<p>low-/lower-middle-income countries recognized they needed treatment; the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding statistic for the high-income countries was two out of every three affected 
</p>
<p>people (64.9%) (Thornicroft et&nbsp;al., 2017). Combining responses from countries of 
</p>
<p>all income levels, 71.1% of people with MDD who recognized a need for treatment 
</p>
<p>made at least one visit to a service provider in the previous 12&nbsp;months; unfortu-
</p>
<p>nately, only 41.0% of these service users received treatment that could be consid-
</p>
<p>ered minimally adequate in terms of medications and/or healthcare provider visits. 
</p>
<p>This potential quality-of-care problem was worse in low-/lower-middle-income 
</p>
<p>countries, where only one out of every five service users (20.5%) received care that 
</p>
<p>was minimally adequate (Thornicroft et&nbsp;al., 2017). Examining problems with qual-
</p>
<p>ity of care for depression from the supply side, a seminal WHO study showed wide 
</p>
<p>variation in the detection of depression by primary care physicians across 14 coun-
</p>
<p>tries (Sartorius, Ustun, Lecrubier, &amp; Wittchen, 1996). Overall, physicians detected 
</p>
<p>only half of all cases, with sites in several countries being even lower than that: 
</p>
<p>19.3% in Nagasaki, Japan; 26.6% in Ibadan, Nigeria; and 28.4% in Ankara, Turkey 
</p>
<p>(Lecrubier, 2001).
</p>
<p> Functional Limitations and&nbsp;Age
</p>
<p>The WMH Survey Initiative examined the role and other functional impairments that 
</p>
<p>could reduce labor market participation among individuals with MDD.&nbsp; Because 
</p>
<p>employment is the main source of household income and household spending, the 
</p>
<p>functional impairments associated with MDD could conceivably affect economic 
</p>
<p>growth (Frumkin, 2000). Therefore, it seems counterintuitive that younger respon-
</p>
<p>dents with MDD in developed countries fared far worse than did their counterparts in 
</p>
<p>developing countries in terms of the mean number of days they were unable to work 
</p>
<p>or fulfill other routine obligations in the past year. Specifically, the mean number of 
</p>
<p>K. C. Heslin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23
</p>
<p>days &ldquo;out of role&rdquo; were up to twice as high for the three youngest age groups in the 
</p>
<p>developed as compared with the developing countries (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>One explanation for the greater degree of MDD-related functional impairments 
</p>
<p>among respondents in developed countries is the possible mental health risks asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with more affluent lifestyles (&ldquo;affluenza&rdquo;), which may provide relatively 
</p>
<p>fewer opportunities for younger people to develop adaptive coping strategies and 
</p>
<p>emotional resilience (Koplewicz, Gurian, &amp; Williams, 2009). However, this inter-
</p>
<p>pretation of an association between higher income and functional impairments at 
</p>
<p>the national level is questionable, because the prevalence of functional impairments 
</p>
<p>in a developed country could be disproportionately concentrated among poorer resi-
</p>
<p>dents. Rather than overall national income, functional impairments in MDD and 
</p>
<p>other conditions could be related to greater income inequality, i.e., a more uneven 
</p>
<p>distribution of income across the population (Picketty, 2015). According to a WMH 
</p>
<p>Survey Initiative study, the poorest respondents in the high-income countries of 
</p>
<p>France, Germany, New Zealand, and the USA had twice the odds of depression than 
</p>
<p>their high-income compatriots&mdash;a difference that was not found between income 
</p>
<p>groups in the low- to middle-income countries (Kessler &amp; Bromet, 2013). Finding 
</p>
<p>a strong positive association between income inequality and the prevalence of men-
</p>
<p>tal disorders among 12 high-income countries, Pickett and Wilkinson (2010) sug-
</p>
<p>gested that inequality increases status competition and insecurity to the detriment of 
</p>
<p>social relationships and cultural institutions that foster mental health (Pickett &amp; 
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, 2010).
</p>
<p>Epidemiologic surveys consistently report that the prevalence of depressive dis-
</p>
<p>orders decreases with age and is particularly low among individuals aged 65 and 
</p>
<p>older. Findings from a WMH Survey Initiative study showed that an age-associated 
</p>
<p>decrease in the prevalence of 12-month MDD was less common in developing than 
</p>
<p>developed countries (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2010). In fact, when the data from developing 
</p>
<p>countries were aggregated, MDD prevalence was found to increase with age (from 
</p>
<p>5.3% among respondents aged 18&ndash;34 to 7.5% among respondents over age 64). By 
</p>
<p>contrast, when the data from all of the developed countries were aggregated, MDD 
</p>
<p>prevalence ranged from a high of 7.0% in the youngest age group (18&ndash;34&nbsp;years old) 
</p>
<p>to a low of 2.6% in the oldest (65 and older). Exceptions to this overall pattern 
</p>
<p>among the participating developed countries were Italy, Israel, and Spain, where the 
</p>
<p>prevalence of MDD did not change significantly with age. Among the developed 
</p>
<p>countries, Israel had the highest prevalence of MDD among respondents aged 65 
</p>
<p>and older (6.6%), whereas Japan had the lowest (1.0%) (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p> Comorbid Conditions
</p>
<p>The presence of comorbid MSUD among people with depression can complicate 
</p>
<p>clinical management, with potentially serious consequences in terms of disablement 
</p>
<p>and suicidal ideation and behavior. One of the strongest predictors of such outcomes 
</p>
<p>The Global Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24
</p>
<p>among people with MDD is comorbid anxiety disorders (Wu &amp; Fang, 2014). In a 
</p>
<p>WMH Survey Initiative study, 19.5% of respondents with comorbid 12-month 
</p>
<p>MDD and anxiety disorder reported that they had &ldquo;seriously thought about commit-
</p>
<p>ting suicide&rdquo; in the previous 12&nbsp;months compared with 8.9% of respondents without 
</p>
<p>comorbid anxiety (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2015). Among high-income countries, the preva-
</p>
<p>lence of suicidal ideation in respondents with comorbid 12-month MDD and anxi-
</p>
<p>ety disorder was highest in Japan (32.7%), and among low-/middle-income 
</p>
<p>countries, the highest prevalence of suicidal ideation with these comorbid disorders 
</p>
<p>was in Colombia and Nigeria (both 20.8%).
</p>
<p> Bipolar Disorders
</p>
<p>Bipolar and related disorders are a spectrum of conditions that historically have 
</p>
<p>roots in the classic diagnostic constructs of manic depression and affective psycho-
</p>
<p>ses. The defining features of these disorders are episodes of elevated, expansive, or 
</p>
<p>irritable mood (mania, hypomania) alternating with episodes of depression of vary-
</p>
<p>ing lengths and degrees of intensity (APA, 2013). The WMH Survey Initiative pro-
</p>
<p>vides information on the global prevalence of bipolar spectrum (BPS) conditions, 
</p>
<p>an overarching category that encompasses the more specific diagnoses of bipolar I/
</p>
<p>II disorders as well as subthreshold bipolar cases.
</p>
<p>Aggregated across 11 countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, the lifetime 
</p>
<p>and 12-month prevalence of BPS among adults were 2.4% and 1.5%, respectively 
</p>
<p>(Merikangas et&nbsp;al., 2011). Broken down to country-level estimates, the USA had the 
</p>
<p>highest lifetime and 12-month prevalence (4.4% and 2.8%), whereas India had the 
</p>
<p>lowest (0.1% and 0.1%). As with a number of other mental disorders, higher-income 
</p>
<p>countries tended to have higher prevalence of BPS; however, there were some nota-
</p>
<p>ble exceptions to that pattern in both directions. For example, the high-income 
</p>
<p>country of Japan had relatively low lifetime prevalence of BPS (0.7%), whereas the 
</p>
<p>low-income country of Colombia had relatively high lifetime prevalence (2.6%). 
</p>
<p>The WMH Survey Initiative also showed that comorbidities are common in 
</p>
<p>BPS.&nbsp;Specifically, anxiety disorders, SUD, and behavioral disorders (e.g., conduct 
</p>
<p>disorder and intermittent explosive disorder) had lifetime prevalence estimates of 
</p>
<p>62.6%, 36.6%, and 44.8%, respectively, among respondents with BPS across all 
</p>
<p>participating countries (Merikangas et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p> Use of&nbsp;Services
</p>
<p>Despite the often-adverse effects of BPS on role functioning, the use of mental 
</p>
<p>health services by adults with BPS is quite low. Across all countries represented in 
</p>
<p>the study by Merikangas et&nbsp;al. (2011), less than half of individuals with lifetime 
</p>
<p>BPS diagnoses reported any use of services in the mental health sector. In 
</p>
<p>K. C. Heslin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25
</p>
<p>country- level estimates grouped by the World Bank income categories, mental 
</p>
<p>health service use among respondents with BPS was 25.2% in low-/lower-middle-
</p>
<p>income countries, 33.9% in upper-middle-income countries, and 50.2% in high-
</p>
<p>income countries. Given that the severity of depressive episodes was found to be 
</p>
<p>greater among people with BPS in the lower-income countries, the lower use of 
</p>
<p>mental health services in these countries is a cause for concern (Merikangas et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2011).
</p>
<p> Anxiety Disorders
</p>
<p>An apprehensive anticipation of future threats characterized by varying degrees of 
</p>
<p>fear, worry, or physical tension, anxiety in moderate levels may actually be adaptive 
</p>
<p>by motivating individuals to prepare for situations involving a perceived increase in 
</p>
<p>risk. Anxiety is a symptom found in nearly all mental disorders. When anxiety is the 
</p>
<p>main symptom causing an individual clinically significant distress and impairment, 
</p>
<p>the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder may be made. Anxiety disorders have been 
</p>
<p>among the most prevalent mental disorders in community epidemiologic studies 
</p>
<p>using modern diagnostic criteria (Horwath, Gould, &amp; Weissman, 2011). This sec-
</p>
<p>tion describes cross-national findings on the epidemiology of generalized anxiety 
</p>
<p>disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific 
</p>
<p>phobia.
</p>
<p> Generalized Anxiety Disorders
</p>
<p>The symptoms of GAD are common and relatively diffuse. Although symptoms are 
</p>
<p>persistent and present &ldquo;for more days than not&rdquo; for at least 6&nbsp;months (APA, 2013), 
</p>
<p>the sense of apprehensive expectation characteristic of anxiety disorders may be 
</p>
<p>relatively minimal, and there are no panic attacks. Further, patients are often not 
</p>
<p>able to identify a specific object or event as the focal point of worry, as is the case 
</p>
<p>with specific phobia. Therefore, GAD is often regarded in clinical practice as a 
</p>
<p>residual diagnostic category for patients who do not meet the more specific criteria 
</p>
<p>for other disorders (e.g., specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder). A diagno-
</p>
<p>sis of GAD involves the presence of excessive anxiety and worry that is difficult for 
</p>
<p>the patient to control, accompanied by three or more of the following six symptoms 
</p>
<p>for at least 6&nbsp;months: restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, mus-
</p>
<p>cle tension, and sleep disturbance (APA, 2013).
</p>
<p>Within countries, the prevalence of GAD tended to be higher among lower- 
</p>
<p>income, less-educated population subgroups in a WMH Survey Initiative study 
</p>
<p>(Ruscio et&nbsp;al., 2017). When the data were aggregated at the country level, however, 
</p>
<p>high-income countries had a higher prevalence of GAD (5.0%) than did middle- 
</p>
<p>income and low-income countries (2.8% and 1.6%, respectively). Similarly, the 
</p>
<p>The Global Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26
</p>
<p>prevalence of severe role impairment related to GAD was greater among the higher- 
</p>
<p>income countries, reaching approximately 80% among affected individuals in the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands and Romania. By contrast, the course of the disorder was somewhat 
</p>
<p>more chronic and unremitting in the lower-income countries, with 59.5% of lifetime 
</p>
<p>cases also screening positive for GAD in the previous 12&nbsp;months, compared with 
</p>
<p>56.1% in middle-income and 45.9% in high-income countries. This persistence of 
</p>
<p>symptoms in the lower-income countries may be related to the relatively lower lev-
</p>
<p>els of treatment among individuals with 12-month GAD, particularly for specialty 
</p>
<p>mental health and general medical services (Ruscio et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Separation Anxiety Disorder
</p>
<p>Separation anxiety disorder is more common among children than among adults; 
</p>
<p>however, it can have serious functional consequences for those adults who are 
</p>
<p>affected. Because of the excessive fear or anxiety involved with anticipating or 
</p>
<p>experiencing separation from major attachment figures (e.g., family members), 
</p>
<p>adults with this disorder may entirely avoid situations such as working outside the 
</p>
<p>home or travelling independently.
</p>
<p>The lifetime prevalence of separation anxiety disorder among adults in the WMH 
</p>
<p>Survey Initiative was fairly similar among countries grouped by World Bank income 
</p>
<p>categories: 4.7% in the high-income group, 4.7% in upper-middle-income group, 
</p>
<p>and 5.5% in low-/lower-middle-income group (Silove et&nbsp;al., 2015). The range of 
</p>
<p>country-level prevalence estimates for the three income groups was also similar: 
</p>
<p>from 1.2% (Spain) to 9.2% (USA) in the high-income group, 0.9% (Romania) to 
</p>
<p>7.7% (Brazil) in the upper-middle-income group, and 0.2% (Nigeria) to 9.8% 
</p>
<p>(Colombia) in the low-/lower-middle-income group. However, what most distin-
</p>
<p>guished the three World Bank income groups was the prevalence of severe role 
</p>
<p>impairments in work, home management, social life, and personal relationships. 
</p>
<p>The higher the income level, the greater the prevalence of impairments related to 
</p>
<p>separation anxiety disorder: 41.4% (high income), 38.2% (upper-middle income), 
</p>
<p>and 17.6% (low-/low-middle income).
</p>
<p>The finding that adults with separation anxiety disorder in poorer countries had 
</p>
<p>fewer impairments could be interpreted in light of known cultural differences in the 
</p>
<p>belief that separation between family members is desirable or normal. Specifically, 
</p>
<p>there is wide variation across counties concerning the age at which it is considered 
</p>
<p>appropriate for individuals to move out of their parental home (APA, 2013). 
</p>
<p>Multigenerational households are more common in countries that are less devel-
</p>
<p>oped economically, particularly in rural areas with fewer wage labor opportunities, 
</p>
<p>where adults can continue living and working on family farms (Ruggles &amp; 
</p>
<p>Heggeness, 2008). In such cases, the behavioral aspects of separation anxiety disor-
</p>
<p>der could be compatible with local norms for social functioning.

</p>
<p> Social Anxiety Disorder
</p>
<p>Social anxiety disorder is a common and frequently disabling disorder characterized 
</p>
<p>by excessive performance and interactional fears that cause substantial levels of 
</p>
<p>distress and avoidance. In the WMH Survey Initiative, the lifetime prevalence of 
</p>
<p>social anxiety disorder in 26 countries grouped by the World Bank income catego-
</p>
<p>ries was highest for the high-income countries, at 5.5% (versus 2.9% for upper- 
</p>
<p>middle- income and 1.6% for low-/lower-middle-income countries). Among all 26 
</p>
<p>countries, the USA had the highest lifetime prevalence, at 12.1% (Stein et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p>Comparing high- and lower-income countries, assessments of equity in the 
</p>
<p>accessibility of mental health services can be based on the degree to which indica-
</p>
<p>tors of increased need such as functional impairments determine the use of services 
</p>
<p>(Andersen &amp; Davidson, 1996). In the WMH Survey Initiative study, functional 
</p>
<p>impairments among people with 12-month social anxiety disorder were more com-
</p>
<p>mon in the higher-income countries, with the Netherlands having the highest preva-
</p>
<p>lence of impairments at work (56.8%) and home (41.9%). However, the use of 
</p>
<p>specialty mental health services was related to increased levels of impairment only 
</p>
<p>in the high-income countries, raising concerns about global equity in access to care. 
</p>
<p>Specifically, 34.4% of the most functionally impaired respondents in the high- 
</p>
<p>income countries used specialty mental health services, compared with 19.2% of 
</p>
<p>their counterparts with mild impairment. By contrast, in the low-/lower-middle- 
</p>
<p>income countries, specialty mental health service use among the most impaired 
</p>
<p>respondents was actually lower than that among respondents with mild impairment 
</p>
<p>(6.3% vs. 10.7%, respectively) (Stein et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Specific Phobia
</p>
<p>A key feature of specific phobia is that the fear or anxiety experienced is restricted 
</p>
<p>to the presence of a particular stimulus&mdash;most commonly animals, blood, features of 
</p>
<p>the natural environment (e.g., heights, storms, water), and enclosed places such as 
</p>
<p>elevators and airplanes (APA, 2013). In an analysis pooling WMH Survey Initiative 
</p>
<p>data from 22 countries, Wardenaar, Lim, Al-Hamzawi, and Alonso (2018) reported 
</p>
<p>that the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of specific phobia were 7.4% and 5.5%, 
</p>
<p>respectively. Stratifying by income at the national level, lifetime prevalence was 
</p>
<p>higher in the high-income (8.1%) and upper-middle-income (8.0%) countries than 
</p>
<p>in low-/lower-middle-income (5.7%) countries. Within each of these three national 
</p>
<p>income categories, however, the range of lifetime prevalence estimates was quite 
</p>
<p>similar: from 3.4% (Japan and Poland) to 12.5% (USA) among the high- income 
</p>
<p>countries, 3.8% (Romania) to 12.5% (Brazil) among the upper-middle- income 
</p>
<p>countries, and 2.6% (China) to 12.5% (Colombia) among the low-/lower-middle-
</p>
<p>income countries (Wardenaar et&nbsp;al., 2018).

</p>
<p> Use of&nbsp;Services
</p>
<p>A substantial evidence base exists for the treatment of anxiety disorders, especially 
</p>
<p>for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and various types of cognitive 
</p>
<p>behavioral therapy (CBT). Because SSRIs are available as low-cost generics and 
</p>
<p>CBT is a time-limited intervention requiring relatively low levels of resources, the 
</p>
<p>WHO has identified anxiety disorders as appropriate for scaling up interventions in 
</p>
<p>resource-limited settings (Eaton, De Silva, Rojas, &amp; Patel, 2014). Findings from the 
</p>
<p>WMH Survey Initiative, however, suggest that considerable barriers to treatment for 
</p>
<p>anxiety disorders exist across countries in all World Bank income categories and 
</p>
<p>that the use of treatment of adequate quality are, in some lower-income countries, 
</p>
<p>unfortunately low. Specifically, an analysis of data from 21 countries examined the 
</p>
<p>use of any treatment for anxiety, as well as the use of &ldquo;possibly adequate treatment.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Treatment was defined broadly as a course of pharmacotherapy for at least 1&nbsp;month 
</p>
<p>with at least four medical doctor visits or as psychotherapy, complementary/alterna-
</p>
<p>tive medicine, or nonmedical care (e.g., social work counseling in a nonmedical 
</p>
<p>setting) for at least eight visits. Not surprisingly, the results showed an inverse rela-
</p>
<p>tionship between country income and the percentage of respondents with 12-month 
</p>
<p>anxiety disorders who received possibly adequate treatment: 13.8% of respondents 
</p>
<p>in high-income countries, 7.1% in upper-middle-income countries, and 2.3% in 
</p>
<p>lower-middle-income countries. Results at the country level were even more reveal-
</p>
<p>ing. No respondents with 12-month anxiety disorders in Nigeria, for example, 
</p>
<p>reported receiving possibly adequate treatment in the previous 12&nbsp; months. 
</p>
<p>Corresponding findings for Lebanon (an upper-middle-income country), Iraq, and 
</p>
<p>Peru were, respectively, 1.3%, 1.7%, and 1.1% (Alonso et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p> Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
</p>
<p>Formerly categorized as a type of anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder 
</p>
<p>(PTSD) is a key diagnosis in the relatively recent DSM category of trauma- and 
</p>
<p>stressor-related disorders (APA, 2013). A defining characteristic of PTSD and 
</p>
<p>related conditions is previous exposure to a traumatic or stressful event, whether it 
</p>
<p>was a single overwhelming event or a period of prolonged, repeated abuse. The 
</p>
<p>distress following such events can often be characterized in terms of anxiety or fear, 
</p>
<p>but what distinguishes PTSD and other trauma- and stressor-related disorders from 
</p>
<p>anxiety disorders is the predominance of additional clinical features. These include 
</p>
<p>anhedonia (loss of enjoyment in life experiences), dysphoria (feelings of depres-
</p>
<p>sion, discontent, or indifference), dissociation (the splitting of thoughts from emo-
</p>
<p>tional significance), and outwardly angry or aggressive symptoms (APA, 2013). The 
</p>
<p>risk of onset and severity of PTSD varies across cultural groups within and across 
</p>
<p>countries and regions of the world. The variation reflects differences in the fre-
</p>
<p>quency of various types of traumatic events (e.g., genocide, car accidents), the 
</p>

<p>29
</p>
<p>ongoing sociocultural context (e.g., pervasive coverage of gun violence in news and 
</p>
<p>entertainment media), pre-traumatic factors (childhood material deprivation), and 
</p>
<p>other factors (e.g., acculturative stress among migrants).
</p>
<p>Refugees fleeing armed conflict, persecution, and other types of potentially life- 
</p>
<p>threatening traumatic events in their countries of origin are a key focus of concern 
</p>
<p>in the field of global mental health, as these individuals are at greater risk of PTSD 
</p>
<p>and other common mental disorders than are non-refugee migrants. For many sur-
</p>
<p>vivors, exposure to such trauma is prolonged and disabling. Further, enduring eco-
</p>
<p>nomic problems, discrimination, and violence can reactivate symptoms of remitted 
</p>
<p>disorders or precipitate the onset of new ones (Kinzie, 2007). Both pre- and post- 
</p>
<p>migration onsets of PTSD among Latino and Asian refugee and non-refugee 
</p>
<p>migrants to the USA were examined by Rasmussen, Crager, Baser, Chu, and Gany 
</p>
<p>(2012) using the data from the National Latino and Asian American Study, a nation-
</p>
<p>ally representative household survey of Asian and Latino immigrants in the USA 
</p>
<p>(Alegria et&nbsp;al., 2004). Compared with non-refugee migrants, refugees more often 
</p>
<p>experienced traumatic events in their countries of origin, such as being an unarmed 
</p>
<p>civilian in a war zone (5.0% vs. 32.1%), being a civilian exposed to ongoing terror 
</p>
<p>(6.1% vs. 28.1%), seeing dead bodies or serious injuries in others (21.1% vs. 
</p>
<p>35.3%), and being exposed to a major natural disaster (19.1% vs. 26.2%). With 
</p>
<p>these histories of trauma in their countries of origin, refugees more often reported 
</p>
<p>pre-migration onset of PTSD than did non-refugee migrants. After immigrating to 
</p>
<p>the USA, however, onset of PTSD did not differ between refugees and non-refugee 
</p>
<p>migrants, suggesting that the common stressors of resettlement had mental health 
</p>
<p>consequences for both groups (Rasmussen et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>At the population level, war and genocide have often resulted in PTSD and 
</p>
<p>related disorders among both combatants and civilians, with effects that can be per-
</p>
<p>manently disabling (Kirmayer et&nbsp;al., 2007). A study using WMH Survey Initiative 
</p>
<p>data examined the prevalence of several lifetime mental disorders among respon-
</p>
<p>dents who had been civilians in any of eight European countries or Japan during 
</p>
<p>World War II.&nbsp;The intent of the study was to estimate the risk associated with having 
</p>
<p>lived during that period in &ldquo;a place where there was a war, revolution, military coup, 
</p>
<p>or invasion&rdquo; or &ldquo;where there was ongoing terror of civilians for political, ethnic, 
</p>
<p>religious, or other reasons.&rdquo; Aggregating responses across all participating coun-
</p>
<p>tries, approximately 20% of respondents reported being civilians in a war  zone/
</p>
<p>region of terror during the war, from 2.9% in Romania to 49.1% in Ukraine. Lifetime 
</p>
<p>prevalence of MDD was 11.0% in the total sample and 17.3% among individuals 
</p>
<p>who had been civilians in a war zone/region of terror. Although the war-/terror- 
</p>
<p>exposed group did not have elevated risks for specific types of anxiety disorders 
</p>
<p>compared with the unexposed group (at the time of the study, PTSD was still cate-
</p>
<p>gorized as a DSM anxiety disorder), the prevalence of any lifetime anxiety disorder 
</p>
<p>overall was 12.3% in the exposed group, compared with 8.6% in the total sample 
</p>
<p>(Frounfelker et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>Sexual assault is a global public health concern with the potential for a wide 
</p>
<p>range of adverse health consequences, particularly the development of PTSD

<p>30
</p>
<p>types of lifetime traumatic events and the risk of PTSD have typically asked respon-
</p>
<p>dents whether they have experienced each of several different lifetime traumatic 
</p>
<p>events. To minimize response burden, respondents who have experienced multiple 
</p>
<p>traumatic events have been asked further detailed questions about the single trau-
</p>
<p>matic event that they considered the worst of all. However, this &ldquo;worst event&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>method may overestimate the impact of a given type of traumatic event on PTSD 
</p>
<p>risk among individuals with multiple lifetime traumas, because worst traumas are 
</p>
<p>by definition atypical; such research would produce findings on the relationship 
</p>
<p>between PTSD and the most severe experiences of sexual assault rather than sexual 
</p>
<p>assault per se. For this reason, the WMH Survey Initiative randomly selected a 
</p>
<p>single traumatic event from among a respondent&rsquo;s lifetime traumatic events for 
</p>
<p>more detailed questions. An analysis of responses provided by women in 11 coun-
</p>
<p>tries found that sexual assaults were reported by 12.1% of respondents overall, 
</p>
<p>ranging from 1.8% in Spain to 26.1% in the USA.&nbsp;The prevalence of PTSD associ-
</p>
<p>ated with randomly selected sexual assaults averaged 20.2% across participating 
</p>
<p>countries, with a higher prevalence in the high-income (24.0%) than low-income 
</p>
<p>(11.7%) countries. Because of the low prevalence of sexual assault among men in 
</p>
<p>the WMH Survey Initiative sample, this analysis could focus on women only (Scott 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p> Eating Disorders
</p>
<p>Cross-cultural research indicates that eating disorders such as binge-eating disorder, 
</p>
<p>anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa are more common in developed countries 
</p>
<p>where food is generally abundant and the predominant body ideals emphasize thin-
</p>
<p>ness, particularly for girls and women. Binge-eating disorder is characterized by a 
</p>
<p>perceived lack of control during recurrent eating episodes involving an amount of 
</p>
<p>food that is larger than what most people would eat during a similar time period. 
</p>
<p>The types of compensatory behaviors (e.g., vomiting, laxative use) that characterize 
</p>
<p>bulimia nervosa do not accompany these episodes. The three essential features of 
</p>
<p>anorexia nervosa are persistent restriction of energy intake, intense fear of becom-
</p>
<p>ing fat (&ldquo;fat phobia&rdquo;), or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, and 
</p>
<p>distorted self-perception of body weight or shape (APA, 2013). Research from 
</p>
<p>Hong Kong (Gordon, 2003) and India (Khandelwal, Sharan, &amp; Saxena, 1995) has 
</p>
<p>described cases of a variant form of anorexia nervosa among women in which fat 
</p>
<p>phobia and distorted body image&mdash;key cognitive features among cases in the 
</p>
<p>West&mdash;were largely absent. Such findings suggest that although eating disorders are 
</p>
<p>not limited to Western cultures, their expression varies across countries in ways that 
</p>
<p>reflect distinct cultural beliefs and practices.
</p>
<p>Before the WMH Survey Initiative, few population-based data on eating disorders 
</p>
<p>outside of the USA existed. Kessler et&nbsp;al. (2013) estimated the prevalence of binge-
</p>
<p>eating disorder and bulimia nervosa in one low-income, three upper-middle- income, 
</p>
<p>and nine high-income countries. Sao Paolo, Brazil, had the highest prevalence of 
</p>
<p>K. C. Heslin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>31
</p>
<p>both binge-eating disorder (lifetime, 4.7%; 12&nbsp;months, 1.8%) and bulimia nervosa 
</p>
<p>(lifetime, 2.0%; 12&nbsp;months, 0.9%) among the countries represented. At the other end 
</p>
<p>of the range, Romania had zero prevalence of bulimia nervosa (both lifetime and 
</p>
<p>12&nbsp; months) and the lowest prevalence of binge-eating disorder (lifetime, 0.2%; 
</p>
<p>12&nbsp;months, 0.1%). Using the USA as the comparison group, speed of recovery from 
</p>
<p>bulimia nervosa was more rapid in France and Portugal but less rapid in Italy and the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands. By contrast, speed of recovery from binge-eating disorder was more 
</p>
<p>rapid in the USA than in Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands 
</p>
<p>(Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p>Notably absent in this WMH Survey Initiative analysis were non-Western devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries, which have been the focus of much work on the potential impacts 
</p>
<p>of globalization on the growth of eating disorders. Increased exposure to thin body 
</p>
<p>ideals in Western media is positively associated with symptoms of eating disorders 
</p>
<p>in young women in Africa (Eddy et&nbsp;al., 2007) and Asian region countries (Pike &amp; 
</p>
<p>Dunne, 2015). An innovative study in Fiji found increased onset of dieting and self- 
</p>
<p>induced vomiting among young ethnic Fijian women over a 3-year period during 
</p>
<p>which television use was widely adopted within that county (Becker, Burwell, 
</p>
<p>Gilman, Herzog, &amp; Hamburg, 2002). Increases in the prevalence of eating disorders 
</p>
<p>across developing and non-Western countries have coincided with rapid economic 
</p>
<p>growth and widespread cultural transformations such as shifts in traditional family 
</p>
<p>structures and gender roles (Pike &amp; Dunne, 2015).
</p>
<p> Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
</p>
<p>The diagnosis of ADHD has been the focus of much clinical uncertainty and debate 
</p>
<p>since regulatory approval of stimulant treatment for children first passed in the 
</p>
<p>1960s. Nevertheless, field trials have shown that the ADHD diagnosis can be made 
</p>
<p>with high reliability (Faraone, 2011), based on assessment of the three main symp-
</p>
<p>tom dimensions of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.
</p>
<p>Until two decades ago, diagnoses of ADHD were made primarily in the USA, 
</p>
<p>Canada, and Australia. Traditionally, clinicians outside the USA have relied more 
</p>
<p>often on the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD) than they have the 
</p>
<p>DSM for diagnosis and treatment planning. In Europe, the diagnosis is called hyper-
</p>
<p>kinetic disorder (HKD), as defined by the ICD, 10th edition. Diagnostic criteria for 
</p>
<p>HKD criteria are more restrictive than those for ADHD, i.e., they require more 
</p>
<p>symptoms, all of which must be present in more than one setting (e.g., both home 
</p>
<p>and school). In recent years, with increased knowledge transfer enabled by the 
</p>
<p>worldwide web and other information technology tools, the uptake of the DSM 
</p>
<p>taxonomy by more clinicians outside of the USA is regarded as a key factor in the 
</p>
<p>rising global prevalence of ADHD in adults (Conrad &amp; Bergey, 2014).
</p>
<p>Among the 20 WMH Survey Initiative surveys that assessed adult ADHD, the 
</p>
<p>current prevalence among individuals aged 18&ndash;44 years was 2.8% (Fayyad et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2017). The prevalence of adult ADHD was higher in high-income (3.6%) and 
</p>
<p>The Global Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>32
</p>
<p>upper- middle- income (3.0%) countries than in low- and lower-middle-income 
</p>
<p>countries (1.4%). Estimates ranged from 0.8% in Poland to 7.3% in France among 
</p>
<p>the high- income countries; 0.6% in Romania to 5.9% in Sao Paolo, Brazil, among 
</p>
<p>the upper- middle- income countries; and 0.6% in Iraq to 2.5% in Colombia among 
</p>
<p>the low- and lower-middle-income countries (Fayyad et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Use of&nbsp;Services
</p>
<p>The use of ADHD treatment by affected adults is quite low, even in high-income 
</p>
<p>countries. Specifically, estimates of the percentage of respondents who received 
</p>
<p>any ADHD-specific treatment were 0.0% in a number of countries, including the 
</p>
<p>high- income countries of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and the 
</p>
<p>Murcia region of Spain (but 13.2% in the USA) and the upper-middle-income 
</p>
<p>countries of Lebanon, Romania, and Medellin, Colombia (but 1.9% in both Mexico 
</p>
<p>and Sao Paolo, Brazil). For all four of the low-/lower-middle-income countries rep-
</p>
<p>resented in the analysis, the use of any ADHD-specific treatment by affected adults 
</p>
<p>was 0.0%. These findings on low ADHD treatment use are a concern in light of 
</p>
<p>reports of the substantial functional impairments associated with adult ADHD in 
</p>
<p>terms of cognition, social interaction, mobility, and occupational functioning 
</p>
<p>(Fayyad et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Personality Disorders
</p>
<p>Personality disorders are diagnosed when maladaptive and relatively inflexible pat-
</p>
<p>terns of thinking, feeling, and behavior cause impairments across a wide range of 
</p>
<p>situations, leading to repeated antagonistic, disruptive, and self-defeating experi-
</p>
<p>ences (APA, 2013). Cross-cultural assessment of personality disorders in both the 
</p>
<p>clinical and research contexts should consider symptoms in light of various ethnic, 
</p>
<p>cultural, and socioeconomic factors. For example, the kinds of cognitive and per-
</p>
<p>ceptual distortions that characterize schizotypal personality disorder may reflect 
</p>
<p>culturally appropriate, non-pathological traits derived from long-standing religious 
</p>
<p>beliefs and practices (APA, 2013). An additional caution is that, in many countries, 
</p>
<p>the diagnosis of personality disorder reportedly has been used against socially vul-
</p>
<p>nerable groups, especially young women, who do not conform to dominant cultur-
</p>
<p>ally prescribed roles and forms of self-expression. Political dissidents are vulnerable 
</p>
<p>to being diagnosed with a personality disorder and subsequently institutionalized 
</p>
<p>when they take positions in opposition to national authorities (WHO, 2005a).
</p>
<p>Personality disorders in the DSM are divided into three broad groupings or &ldquo;clus-
</p>
<p>ters&rdquo; based on descriptive similarities. Cluster A includes disorders that share odd and 
</p>
<p>aloof features (paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders); Cluster B 
</p>
<p>includes disorders with dramatic, impulsive, and erratic features (antisocial, borderline, 
</p>
<p>K. C. Heslin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>33
</p>
<p>histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders); and Cluster C includes disorders with 
</p>
<p>anxious and fearful features (avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personal-
</p>
<p>ity disorders) (Sadock, Sadock, &amp; Ruiz, 2015). In an analysis of WMH Survey Initiative 
</p>
<p>data by Huang et&nbsp;al. (2009), the prevalence of any personality disorder (all clusters 
</p>
<p>combined) for the 13 participating countries was 6.1%. At the national or regional 
</p>
<p>level, the prevalence of any personality disorder ranged from 2.4% in Western Europe 
</p>
<p>(including Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) to 7.9% in Colombia. For the 
</p>
<p>three clusters of personality disorders, prevalence estimates based on combined data 
</p>
<p>for all 13 countries were 3.6% for Cluster A, 1.5% for Cluster B, and 2.7% for Cluster 
</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;Cluster A and B disorders were most prevalent in Colombia (5.3% and 2.1%, respec-
</p>
<p>tively), and Cluster C disorders were most prevalent in the USA (4.2%). Among the 
</p>
<p>respondents with any personality disorder, there was wide geographic variation in the 
</p>
<p>percentage reporting the use of professional services for &ldquo;problems with emotions, 
</p>
<p>nerves, or substance use&rdquo; in the 12&nbsp;months before the survey, with estimates ranging 
</p>
<p>from 6.0% in Nigeria to 37.3% in the USA (Huang et&nbsp;al., 2009).
</p>
<p>These findings from the WMH Survey Initiative represent the most comprehen-
</p>
<p>sive source of cross-national data on the prevalence of personality disorders; how-
</p>
<p>ever, the investigators duly noted the concerns about the cross-cultural validity of 
</p>
<p>the personality disorder screening instrument (Huang et&nbsp;al., 2009). In addition, only 
</p>
<p>currently married individuals in a special &ldquo;couples&rdquo; subsample were screened for 
</p>
<p>personality disorders in the participating Western European countries. To the extent 
</p>
<p>that individuals with personality disorders may be less likely to become or remain 
</p>
<p>married, this sampling approach specific to Western Europe may partly explain the 
</p>
<p>relatively low prevalence estimates for that region.
</p>
<p> Substance Use
</p>
<p>A key feature of a variety of social interactions and cultural traditions, alcohol serves 
</p>
<p>many purposes for the world&rsquo;s 2.3 billion drinkers (WHO, 2018). Progress in the 
</p>
<p>economic development of a country can be accompanied by increases in both the 
</p>
<p>availability of alcoholic beverages and the disposable income with which to purchase 
</p>
<p>them, leading to greater consumption. One downside of this development is that 
</p>
<p>harmful use is linked to over 200 serious and costly health problems, including alco-
</p>
<p>holic liver disease (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis), road injuries, cancers, and cardiovascu-
</p>
<p>lar disease (Brick, 2008). The prevalence of heavy episodic or &ldquo;binge&rdquo; drinking is 
</p>
<p>fairly equal across countries within the Americas, Southeast Asia, Eastern 
</p>
<p>Mediterranean, and Western Pacific regions of the WHO.&nbsp;However, within the African 
</p>
<p>region, heavy episodic drinking is more common in lower-income countries, whereas 
</p>
<p>in the European region, it is more common in higher-income countries (WHO, 2018).
</p>
<p>In an analysis of WMH Survey Initiative data from 17 countries, the vast major-
</p>
<p>ity of respondents reported lifetime alcohol use, with the lowest prevalence being in 
</p>
<p>South Africa (40.6%) (Degenhardt et&nbsp;al., 2008). A consistent finding across coun-
</p>
<p>tries was the substantial increase in the initiation of alcohol use that occurs between 
</p>
<p>The Global Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>34
</p>
<p>the ages of 15 and 21. For example, the percentage of respondents initiating alcohol 
</p>
<p>use by the ages of 15 and 21 was, respectively, 29.0% and 77.5% in Mexico, 39.3% 
</p>
<p>and 98.5% in Ukraine, and 50.1% and 93.1% in the USA.&nbsp;Notable for Germany is 
</p>
<p>that fully 82.1% of respondents had initiated alcohol use by age 15 (and 97.8% by 
</p>
<p>the age of 21). Although the majority of the WHO member states have some type of 
</p>
<p>restriction on advertising to prevent early initiation of alcohol use, these efforts 
</p>
<p>focus largely on national television and radio. Nearly half of member states report 
</p>
<p>no advertising restrictions on the Internet and social media, suggesting that regula-
</p>
<p>tions in many countries lag behind technological advances in marketing to young 
</p>
<p>people (WHO, 2018).
</p>
<p>Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance globally, with an estimated 
</p>
<p>182 million nonmedical users aged 15&ndash;64&nbsp; in 2013 (WHO, 2016). The United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2018, June) reports the highest prevalence of 
</p>
<p>cannabis use in North America, Western Central Africa, and Oceania. Historically, 
</p>
<p>countries have not collected and reported data on drug use in a uniform way. Because 
</p>
<p>of the standardized methodology used in the WMH Survey Initiative, it is possible 
</p>
<p>to make meaningful comparisons of the use of cannabis and other substances across 
</p>
<p>countries. In each country participating in the WMH Survey Initiative, lifetime use 
</p>
<p>of cannabis, cocaine, and tobacco was lower than that of alcohol, but estimates var-
</p>
<p>ied greatly across countries (Degenhardt et&nbsp;al., 2018). Specifically, lifetime use of 
</p>
<p>cannabis ranged from 0.3% in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China to 42.4% in the USA, 
</p>
<p>with the greatest percentage of respondents reporting the first use by age 15&nbsp;in New 
</p>
<p>Zealand (26.8%). Lifetime use of cocaine ranged from 0.0% in the People&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of China to 16.2% in the USA, with the greatest percentage of respondents 
</p>
<p>reporting the first use by age 15&nbsp;in the USA (2.5%). Lifetime use of tobacco ranged 
</p>
<p>from 16.8% in Nigeria to 73.6% in the USA, with the greatest percentage of respon-
</p>
<p>dents reporting the first use by age 15&nbsp;in Ukraine (46.0%).
</p>
<p> Substance Use Disorders
</p>
<p>An essential feature of SUD is that the affected individual continues to use the sub-
</p>
<p>stance despite significant substance-related problems, which may include serious 
</p>
<p>and sometimes fatal medical problems affecting multiple organ systems (APA, 
</p>
<p>2013). Additional diagnostic criteria include using a greater quantity of the sub-
</p>
<p>stance than originally intended, repeated unsuccessful attempts to reduce or control 
</p>
<p>use, and failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home because of 
</p>
<p>continued use (APA, 2013). One of the greatest barriers to treatment for SUD is the 
</p>
<p>denial or low recognition of these problems by affected individuals themselves, who 
</p>
<p>may reject offers of help from friends, family members, and professionals (Connors, 
</p>
<p>DiClemente, &amp; Donovan, 2001). The stigmatization of people who misuse alcohol 
</p>
<p>and drugs can also act as a deterrent to help-seeking and recovery. For example, a 
</p>
<p>population-based survey of US adults found that respondents with alcohol use dis-
</p>
<p>orders were less likely to use health and social services for these conditions if they 
</p>
<p>K. C. Heslin</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35
</p>
<p>believed that most people were prejudiced against individuals who had ever received 
</p>
<p>such services (Keyes et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>An analysis of WMH Survey Initiative data from 26 countries found that 
</p>
<p>12-month prevalence of any SUD ranged from 0.2% in the low-/lower-middle- 
</p>
<p>income country of Iraq to 6.6% in the low-/lower-middle-income country of Ukraine 
</p>
<p>(Degenhardt et&nbsp; al., 2017). Although Iraq had the lowest prevalence of SUD, the 
</p>
<p>percentage of respondents with disorders who recognized a need for treatment was 
</p>
<p>actually highest there, at 61.5%, and lowest in the high-income country of Germany, 
</p>
<p>at 12.8%. Among respondents across all countries who believed they needed treat-
</p>
<p>ment, 67.5% received it. Receipt of services ranged from a low of 26.5% in the 
</p>
<p>low-/lower-middle-income country of Peru to a high of 95.4% in the low-/lower- 
</p>
<p>middle- income country of Nigeria. However, receipt of SUD treatment of at least 
</p>
<p>minimally adequate quality was, unfortunately, quite low among those who used 
</p>
<p>any services in the previous 12&nbsp;months. As noted above, Germany had the lowest 
</p>
<p>percentage of respondents with 12-month disorders who perceived a need for treat-
</p>
<p>ment (12.8%), but 100% of those who received treatment in the previous 12&nbsp;months 
</p>
<p>had treatment that met the standards of minimally adequate quality&mdash;as did those 
</p>
<p>who received treatment in Romania. Among all respondents with SUD, including 
</p>
<p>both those who did and those who did not perceive a need for treatment, only 7.1% 
</p>
<p>received at least minimally adequate treatment in the previous 12 months: 1.0% in 
</p>
<p>low-/lower-middle-income countries, 4.3% in upper-middle-income countries, and 
</p>
<p>10.3% in high-income countries (Degenhardt et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p>Chronic misuse of alcohol and other substances may cause changes in brain 
</p>
<p>chemistry that make one more susceptible to mental disorders. This &ldquo;toxicity 
</p>
<p>hypothesis&rdquo; of MSUD comorbidity is supported by a WMH Survey Initiative study 
</p>
<p>in 18 countries showing that the first onset of psychotic experiences was associated 
</p>
<p>with temporally prior alcohol use disorders, extra-medical prescription drug use, 
</p>
<p>and tobacco use, even after controlling for other temporally prior MSUD, as well as 
</p>
<p>respondent age, sex, and country (Degenhardt et&nbsp;al., 2018). Conversely, psychotic 
</p>
<p>experiences were also identified as risk factors (rather than outcomes) for the onset 
</p>
<p>of disorders related to alcohol, nicotine, and other drugs&mdash;even after controlling for 
</p>
<p>other temporally prior MSUD, as well as respondent age, sex, and country 
</p>
<p>(Degenhardt et&nbsp; al., 2018). This finding is consistent with the &ldquo;self-medication 
</p>
<p>hypothesis&rdquo; of MSUD comorbidity, which posits that individuals initiate substance 
</p>
<p>use to relieve symptoms of mental disorders, eventually leading to development of 
</p>
<p>comorbid SUD (McGrath et&nbsp;al., 2003).
</p>
<p> Gender and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Evolving Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental 
</p>
<p>and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders
</p>
<p>Numerous epidemiologic studies have documented a higher prevalence of anxiety 
</p>
<p>and mood disorders among women than men, as well as higher rates of SUD among 
</p>
<p>men than women (Brady &amp; Randall, 1999; Kuehner, 2003; Pigott, 1999). However, 
</p>
<p>The Global Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36
</p>
<p>these gender differences may be narrowing over time, particularly in countries 
</p>
<p>where opportunities for women in employment, participation in civic life, and 
</p>
<p>access to sexual and reproductive health services have increased. With greater glo-
</p>
<p>balization in labor markets, these opportunities have likely played out differently for 
</p>
<p>women in developed and developing countries. For women with caregiving respon-
</p>
<p>sibilities who work outside the home in low-paying jobs without childcare facilities, 
</p>
<p>these increased employment opportunities could bring with them new sources of 
</p>
<p>interpersonal stress, which could conceivably precipitate the onset of MSUD (Lewis 
</p>
<p>&amp; Araya, 2002).
</p>
<p>Seedat et&nbsp;al. (2009) used WMH Survey Initiative data to examine gender differ-
</p>
<p>ences in lifetime MSUD across birth cohorts within countries, as well as within 
</p>
<p>birth cohorts across countries. Compared with older birth cohorts, the greater risk of 
</p>
<p>MDD among women compared with men was less pronounced for more recent birth 
</p>
<p>cohorts. The greater risk of intermittent explosive disorder and SUD among men 
</p>
<p>compared with women also became less pronounced in younger cohorts. The 15 
</p>
<p>countries represented in the analysis were characterized in terms of a composite 
</p>
<p>measure of &ldquo;gender role traditionality&rdquo; based on WMH survey data on education, 
</p>
<p>income, age at marriage, and contraception use. The results showed that country- 
</p>
<p>level decreases in the &ldquo;gender role traditionality&rdquo; measure were associated with a 
</p>
<p>narrowing of the differences between women and men in MDD and SUD (Seedat 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2009).
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Mental health policies and programs are essential tools for improving population 
</p>
<p>health and reducing what is often referred to as &ldquo;the mental health treatment gap,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that is, the difference between the number of individuals in need of mental health 
</p>
<p>services and those receiving them (Maulik, Daniels, McBain, &amp; Morris, 2014). 
</p>
<p>Across countries with considerably different healthcare systems, the WMH Survey 
</p>
<p>Initiative showed that a substantial proportion of individuals with MSUD had not 
</p>
<p>received any kind of mental health service in the previous 12&nbsp;months, particularly in 
</p>
<p>lower-income countries (Wang et&nbsp;al., 2007). A key challenge for the epidemiology 
</p>
<p>of MSUD is overcoming obstacles to the translation of research findings into policy- 
</p>
<p>relevant information that can be used by public officials to reduce these gaps.
</p>
<p>To identify factors that influence the uptake of research findings into mental 
</p>
<p>health policy-making, Weinberg et&nbsp;al. (2012) interviewed individuals involved in 
</p>
<p>implementing the WMH Survey Initiative in 12 different countries. The authors 
</p>
<p>concluded that the surveys generated strong interest among policy-makers within 
</p>
<p>countries, especially when a member of the study team had established relation-
</p>
<p>ships with such officials through previous employment in government health agen-
</p>
<p>cies. For example, the interviewees from Australia and Israel stated that, because 
</p>
<p>of these long-standing relationships, they were able to conduct tailored presenta-
</p>
<p>tions on WMH survey findings to important government stakeholders. These same 
</p>

</p>
<p>interviewees described how the WMH surveys and other sources of population 
</p>
<p>health data played a role in advocating for expansions in public coverage of mental 
</p>
<p>health services in their respective countries (Weinberg et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>By funding epidemiologic MSUD surveys, government stakeholders can influ-
</p>
<p>ence the selection of research topics in ways that advance important health policy 
</p>
<p>objectives. In Northern Ireland, support of the WMH Survey Initiative enabled the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Health to promote a focus on the issue of PTSD in parts of the country 
</p>
<p>affected by the &ldquo;Troubles&rdquo; of the 1970s to 1990s. Because the prevalence of PTSD 
</p>
<p>in certain parts of Northern Ireland was considerably higher than that of other coun-
</p>
<p>tries with recent histories of war, such as Israel and Lebanon, the Ministry funded a 
</p>
<p>follow-up study of WMH Survey Initiative respondents who were young during the 
</p>
<p>time of the Troubles to obtain more detailed information on their experiences of the 
</p>
<p>conflict.
</p>
<p>As another example of the use of epidemiologic data in policy-making, the 
</p>
<p>WMH Survey Initiative study in France found that half of the respondents using 
</p>
<p>antidepressant medication did not meet diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder 
</p>
<p>and a fifth of those taking antidepressants did so for less than 3&nbsp;weeks (the minimum 
</p>
<p>period believed to be needed for clinical effect). After the French House of Deputies 
</p>
<p>learned of the potential misuse of antidepressants, they conducted an investigation 
</p>
<p>using a variety of information sources, including findings from the country&rsquo;s WMH 
</p>
<p>Survey Initiative study, and found that an unexpectedly high number of general 
</p>
<p>practitioners in France were prescribing the medications (Weinberg et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>As urgent as the need to reduce the mental health treatment gap is, an equally 
</p>
<p>pressing issue for global mental health policy is identifying and eradicating the sys-
</p>
<p>tematic abuse that many people with mental illness endure in various clinical, social, 
</p>
<p>and legal contexts (Szmukler, 2014). In the introduction to the Resource Book on 
</p>
<p>Mental Health, Human Rights and Legislation, the WHO (2005a) underscored the 
</p>
<p>urgency of strengthening the human rights provisions of mental health legislation 
</p>
<p>and reforming mental health treatment systems and practices worldwide:
</p>
<p>There are more than 450 million people with mental, neurological, or behavioral problems 
</p>
<p>throughout the world. In many countries, they are among the most vulnerable and the least 
</p>
<p>legally protected&hellip; In some communities, people with mental disorders are tied or chained 
</p>
<p>to trees or logs. Others are incarcerated in prisons without having been accused of a crime. 
</p>
<p>In many psychiatric institutions and hospitals, patients face gross violations of their rights. 
</p>
<p>People are restrained with metal shackles, confined in caged beds, deprived of clothing, 
</p>
<p>decent bedding, clean water or proper toilet facilities and are subject to abuse&hellip; people with 
</p>
<p>mental disorders often face social isolation and severe stigmatization&hellip; including discrimi-
</p>
<p>nation in education, employment, and housing. Some countries even prohibit people from 
</p>
<p>voting, marrying, or having children.
</p>
<p>The successful translation of WMH Survey Initiative results into national health 
</p>
<p>policies raises the question of how epidemiologic research can inform efforts to 
</p>
<p>promote and protect the human rights of people with mental illness worldwide. 
</p>
<p>Because of various logistical and ethical obstacles to study implementation, the 
</p>
<p>sampling frames of population-based surveys typically exclude hospitals, prisons, 
</p>
<p>long-term care homes, and other facilities&mdash;i.e., the very settings where the use of 
</p>
<p>The Global Epidemiology of&nbsp;Mental and&nbsp;Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38
</p>
<p>involuntary placement, physical restraints, and forced seclusion can result in viola-
</p>
<p>tions of international human rights laws. Nevertheless, data collection and analysis 
</p>
<p>can further the goals of policies to eliminate the systematic abuse of people with 
</p>
<p>mental illness and other disabilities. State signatories to the United Nations (UN) 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) are obligated to 
</p>
<p>ensure the monitoring of health and correctional facilities by independent bodies 
</p>
<p>(Szmukler, Daw, &amp; Callard, 2014). From a research perspective, the Government of 
</p>
<p>Indonesia is a particularly noteworthy CRPD signatory, having made extensive use 
</p>
<p>of data collected from both households and facilities in their efforts to eliminate the 
</p>
<p>widespread practice of chaining individuals with mental disorders and other dis-
</p>
<p>abilities to long wooden planks (i.e., shackling). In Central Java, one official has 
</p>
<p>asserted that &ldquo;the target of zero shackling cases&hellip; can be achieved if data on victims 
</p>
<p>can be gathered properly&rdquo; through district-level community health centers (Collins, 
</p>
<p>Tomlinson, Kakuma, Awuba, &amp; Minas, 2014). Monitoring conducted by the non-
</p>
<p>governmental organization Human Rights Watch indicates that these efforts have 
</p>
<p>led to a promising reduction in shackling, but much work remains before the goal of 
</p>
<p>eradication is reached (Human Rights Watch, 2018).
</p>
<p>Working within logistical and ethical constraints on access to potential study 
</p>
<p>respondents, one approach for epidemiologic studies relevant to these issues would 
</p>
<p>be to elicit retrospective reports on conditions in health and correctional settings 
</p>
<p>from former patients, residents, or convicts. In countries with population-based 
</p>
<p>health registers, probability samples of former psychiatric inpatients could be drawn 
</p>
<p>for patient experience surveys that include items on maltreatment. However, limited 
</p>
<p>such studies may be, they could provide government stakeholders and international 
</p>
<p>human rights organizations with useful information on conditions in some of the 
</p>
<p>settings where people with mental illness are most vulnerable to harm.

<p>Behavioral Health Approaches 
to&nbsp;Preventing and&nbsp;Treating Substance Use 
Disorders
</p>

</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Worldwide, the harmful use of alcohol results in 3.3 million deaths each year, and 
</p>
<p>31 million persons have drug use disorders (World Health Organization (WHO), 
</p>
<p>2014). Substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, have harmful effects on health 
</p>
<p>and safety, and are a significant drain on our nation&rsquo;s economy. Annually, excessive 
</p>
<p>drinking costs the United States $249 billion (Centers for Disease Control and 
</p>
<p>Prevention, 2018), and illicit drug use $193 billion (National Drug Intelligence 
</p>
<p>Center, 2011), in lost productivity, healthcare expenses, and law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>criminal costs. Preventing SUDs is critical, and early intervention and treatment are 
</p>
<p>essential to avoid their devastating impact and reduce their high costs to society.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we review the literature on behavioral approaches to preventing 
</p>
<p>and treating SUDs. We focus mainly on alcohol and illicit drugs, rather than on 
</p>
<p>addictions to nicotine and prescription drugs, or on solutions to the current opioid 
</p>
<p>crisis (Meldrum, 2016). In addition, we focus on behavioral therapies rather than 
</p>
<p>pharmacological interventions. We include a discussion of behavioral treatments for

<p>individuals who have co-occurring substance use and other mental disorders. After 
</p>
<p>reviewing the literature, we present critical issues related to behavioral strategies for 
</p>
<p>SUD prevention and treatment, such as the need for better coordination of care 
</p>
<p>within healthcare systems. We also discuss behavioral treatments for SUDs in the 
</p>
<p>context of financing services delivery, by considering personalized care that begins 
</p>
<p>with low-intensity options and can be intensified if indicated. Throughout this chap-
</p>
<p>ter, we point out gaps in knowledge for which more research is needed.
</p>
<p> Review of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Literature
</p>
<p>The risky use of substances covers a spectrum of behaviors (Office of the Surgeon 
</p>
<p>General, 2016). Regarding alcohol use, for example, hazardous drinkers consume 
</p>
<p>alcohol above recommended limits set by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
</p>
<p>and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Hazardous drinkers experience physical, social, or psy-
</p>
<p>chological harm associated with their alcohol use but do not necessarily meet crite-
</p>
<p>ria for an alcohol use disorder. SUDs are associated with repeated and negative 
</p>
<p>physical, psychological, and social effects from alcohol and other drugs (Office of 
</p>
<p>the Surgeon General, 2016). In the DSM-5, a diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder 
</p>
<p>requires meeting 2 or more criteria, out of 11 (e.g., neglect major roles to drink or 
</p>
<p>use, increased tolerance), within a 12-month period; a criteria count is an overall 
</p>
<p>severity indicator. Furthermore, an alcohol use disorder diagnosis in DSM-5 requires 
</p>
<p>specifying severity, with 2&ndash;3 symptoms indicating a mild, 4&ndash;5 symptoms a moder-
</p>
<p>ate, and 6 or more a severe disorder.
</p>
<p>One approach to addressing the needs of people with the full spectrum of sub-
</p>
<p>stance use-related behaviors is the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to 
</p>
<p>Treatment (SBIRT) model. SBIRT is a comprehensive, integrated, public health 
</p>
<p>approach to the delivery of early intervention and referral to more intensive treat-
</p>
<p>ment services for people with a range of unhealthy substance use. Screening identi-
</p>
<p>fies people with unhealthy use and, when followed by the assessment of the severity 
</p>
<p>of substance use, can identify potential treatment goals, such as reducing episodes 
</p>
<p>of heavy consumption or abstinence.
</p>
<p>Designed for individuals at risk of developing SUDs and those who have already 
</p>
<p>developed them, SBIRT can be applied in many clinical care settings. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>SBIRT has been adapted for use in emergency departments, primary care clinics, 
</p>
<p>office- and clinic-based practices, and other community settings (e.g., employee 
</p>
<p>assistance programs), thereby providing opportunities for early intervention with 
</p>
<p>at-risk individuals using substances before more severe substance use develops and/
</p>
<p>or consequences occur. As discussed below, SBIRT interventions can include the 
</p>
<p>provision of brief treatment for those with less severe substance use and referral to 
</p>
<p>specialized SUD treatment for those with a SUD (Agerwala &amp; McCance-Katz, 
</p>
<p>2012). A large body of research on SBIRT for alcohol, illicit drugs, tobacco, and 
</p>
<p>prescription drugs demonstrates that it yields improvements in health (Babor, Del 
</p>
<p>Boca, &amp; Bray, 2017; Babor et&nbsp;al., 2007).

</p>
<p> Screening and&nbsp;Assessment
</p>
<p>SBIRT begins with the introduction of systematic screening into routine care at 
</p>
<p>medical facilities and other community settings where people with SUDs are seen. 
</p>
<p>Screening is a preliminary procedure to evaluate the likelihood that an individual 
</p>
<p>has a SUD or is at risk of negative consequences from the use of alcohol or other 
</p>
<p>drugs. Although screening tests were initially developed to identify active cases of 
</p>
<p>alcohol and drug dependence, the aim of screening has been expanded to cover the 
</p>
<p>full spectrum ranging from risky substance use to dependence.
</p>
<p>Because primary care is the point of access to SUD treatment for many people, 
</p>
<p>universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care is recommended 
</p>
<p>(USPSTF, 2014). The ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) 
</p>
<p>is the most studied screening tool for detecting the severity of alcohol use in primary 
</p>
<p>care settings (USPSTF, 2014). The AUDIT performs adequately to identify hazard-
</p>
<p>ous and problem drinking but may be too long to be integrated easily into many 
</p>
<p>primary care settings. Accordingly, the first three questions of the AUDIT, which 
</p>
<p>ask about alcohol consumption and are called the AUDIT-C, were demonstrated to 
</p>
<p>be an effective screening test for past-year hazardous drinking and for active alcohol 
</p>
<p>use disorders (Bradley et&nbsp;al., 2007). AUDIT-C cutoff scores for unhealthy alcohol 
</p>
<p>use are 4 for men and 3 for women (Bradley et&nbsp;al., 2007) and for alcohol use disor-
</p>
<p>ders are 5 or 6 for men and 4 for women (Dawson, Grant, Stinson, &amp; Zhou, 2005).
</p>
<p>Until recently, there has been a lack of brief and valid screening instruments for 
</p>
<p>substances other than alcohol or tobacco. The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance 
</p>
<p>Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) is used increasingly to assess substance use 
</p>
<p>and related problems, although it may be too lengthy to be feasible in busy primary 
</p>
<p>care settings (McNeely et&nbsp; al., 2014). Shorter assessments for assessing drug use 
</p>
<p>include the Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 (DAST-10) which is used to assess past- 
</p>
<p>year drug consequences and problem severity and has demonstrated sound psycho-
</p>
<p>metric properties (Yudko, Lozhkina, &amp; Fouts, 2007). Scores range from 0 to 10; a 
</p>
<p>score of &ge;3 suggests drug use risk (French, Roebuck, McGeary, Chitwood, &amp; 
</p>
<p>McCoy, 2001; Voluse et&nbsp;al., 2012). There is also a single screening question to iden-
</p>
<p>tify drug use accurately in primary care patients: &ldquo;How many times in the past year 
</p>
<p>have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical 
</p>
<p>reasons?&rdquo;(Smith, Schmidt, Allensworth-Davies, &amp; Saitz, 2009). A response of &gt;1 
</p>
<p>time is considered positive for drug use risk.
</p>
<p> Brief Interventions
</p>
<p>The assessment of substance use may lead to either of two different primary care 
</p>
<p>strategies, based on whether patients have at-risk substance use or a SUD.&nbsp;Patients 
</p>
<p>with at-risk substance use often receive brief interventions. Brief interventions refer 
</p>
<p>to any time-limited effort to provide information or advice, increase motivation to 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health Approaches to&nbsp;Preventing and&nbsp;Treating Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>48
</p>
<p>avoid substance use, or teach behavior change skills that will reduce substance use 
</p>
<p>as well as the chances of negative consequences (Babor et&nbsp;al., 2007). Brief interven-
</p>
<p>tions vary in length and content but typically involve 1&ndash;2 counseling sessions of up 
</p>
<p>to 30&nbsp; min each and may consist of personalized feedback on age- and gender- 
</p>
<p>matched normative comparisons of substance use, self-reported consequences of 
</p>
<p>use, and motivation to change substance use (Cucciare, Simpson, Hoggatt, Gifford, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Timko, 2013).
</p>
<p>Research shows that among the most cost-effective and time-efficient interven-
</p>
<p>tions are brief motivational conversations between a healthcare professional and a 
</p>
<p>patient using substances (Babor et&nbsp;al., 2017; Babor et&nbsp;al., 2007). Indeed, protocol- 
</p>
<p>driven brief interventions have been shown to be effective for reducing alcohol 
</p>
<p>intake, associated injury recidivism, driving under the influence, and other adverse 
</p>
<p>consequences of alcohol and drug use (Babor et&nbsp; al., 2017; Madras et&nbsp; al., 2009; 
</p>
<p>Wamsley, Satterfield, Curtis, Lundgren, &amp; Satre, 2018). However, the literature 
</p>
<p>documenting the effectiveness of brief interventions for illicit drug use is weaker 
</p>
<p>than that for alcohol (Kim et&nbsp;al., 2017; Saitz et&nbsp;al., 2014). For patients identified 
</p>
<p>through screening and assessment as having SUDs rather than risky use, brief inter-
</p>
<p>ventions may be inadequate, and so referrals to specialized treatments should be 
</p>
<p>provided (Kim et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Specialty Treatment
</p>
<p>Patients with SUDs often need more intensive treatment in specialty settings than 
</p>
<p>can be offered in primary care. Therefore, SBIRT incorporates referral to treatment 
</p>
<p>as a critical feature. This may include referral to brief treatment, which involves the 
</p>
<p>delivery of time-limited, structured therapy for a SUD by a trained clinician, and is 
</p>
<p>typically delivered to those at higher risk or in the early stages of substance depen-
</p>
<p>dence. It generally involves two to six sessions of behavioral therapies, which are 
</p>
<p>described below. However, although not discussed in this chapter, brief treatment 
</p>
<p>may also include the ongoing management of SUDs in primary care settings with 
</p>
<p>the use of pharmacotherapy (Fiellin et&nbsp;al., 2013). Here, we describe behavioral ther-
</p>
<p>apies that are considered evidence-based practices in SUD treatment programs. 
</p>
<p>SUD specialty care is delivered in a continuum of program types, including stan-
</p>
<p>dard outpatient, intensive outpatient, and residential care, which is often followed 
</p>
<p>by outpatient aftercare. Within these programs, care is provided individually and in 
</p>
<p>groups.
</p>
<p>Motivational interviewing (MI), an extremely well-known approach, is a client- 
</p>
<p>centered, semi-directive therapeutic style to enhance intrinsic readiness for change 
</p>
<p>by helping individuals explore and resolve ambivalence toward making a life 
</p>
<p>change. An evolution of Rogers&rsquo; person-centered counseling approach, MI and 
</p>
<p>related motivational enhancement therapies (METs) elicit the person&rsquo;s own motiva-
</p>
<p>tions for making a change (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002).

<p>A meta-analysis of 32 clinical trials that focused on treating alcohol use disorder 
</p>
<p>found that the average effect size (for effect sizes, 0.2&ndash;0.3 is small, 0.5 is medium, 
</p>
<p>and 0.8 and higher is large) of MI was 0.41 posttreatment and 0.26 across all follow-
</p>
<p> up points (Hettema, Steele, &amp; Miller, 2005). An additional 13 trials tested the effect 
</p>
<p>of MI in addressing illicit drug use, with average effect sizes of 0.51 for early 
</p>
<p>follow- ups and 0.29 for later follow-ups (Hettema et&nbsp;al., 2005). A subsequent meta- 
</p>
<p>analysis confirmed that MI promotes durable reductions in use of a range of sub-
</p>
<p>stances (Sayegh, Huey, Zara, &amp; Jhaveri, 2017). However, the variable effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of MI found in these meta-analyses across providers, populations, target problems, 
</p>
<p>and settings suggests a need for additional research to understand and specify how 
</p>
<p>MI exerts its effects.
</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pioneered by Aaron Beck and by Albert 
</p>
<p>Ellis, is a class of interventions sharing the premise that mental disorders and psy-
</p>
<p>chological distress are maintained by cognitive factors. To achieve the goal of 
</p>
<p>symptom reduction, improvement in functioning, and remission of the disorder, the 
</p>
<p>patient becomes an active participant in collaborative problem-solving to test and 
</p>
<p>challenge the validity of maladaptive cognitions and modify maladaptive behavioral 
</p>
<p>patterns. Similar to findings for MI, a review of meta-analyses of CBT for SUDs 
</p>
<p>found that effect sizes of CBT ranged from small to medium. Specifically, CBT was 
</p>
<p>highly effective for treating cannabis and nicotine dependence but less effective for 
</p>
<p>treating opioid and alcohol dependence (Hofmann, Asnaani, Vonk, Sawyer, &amp; Fang, 
</p>
<p>2012).
</p>
<p>Contingency management (CM) is based on the principles of operant condition-
</p>
<p>ing. It provides reinforcing or punitive consequences to achieve therapeutic goals, 
</p>
<p>such as abstinence from substance use or increasing treatment attendance (Petry, 
</p>
<p>Alessi, Olmstead, Rash, &amp; Zajac, 2017; Rash, Stitzer, &amp; Weinstock, 2017). For 
</p>
<p>example, abstinence is often reinforced with escalating vouchers (e.g., $2.50 for an 
</p>
<p>initial negative urinalysis, adding $1.50 for each consecutive one), with possible 
</p>
<p>added bonuses, that can be exchanged for goods or services. If a urinalysis is posi-
</p>
<p>tive, no voucher is given, and the value for the next negative urinalysis is reset to the 
</p>
<p>initial level. Besides vouchers, other reinforcers are clinical privileges, cash, or 
</p>
<p>employment.
</p>
<p>Meta-analyses report medium effect sizes for CM in treating SUDs (Lussier, 
</p>
<p>Heil, Mongeon, Badger, &amp; Higgins, 2006; Prendergast, Podus, Finney, Greenwell, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Roll, 2006). In addition, a systematic evaluation found that CM combined with 
</p>
<p>standard psychological interventions to treat cocaine dependence in particular 
</p>
<p>increases abstinence and improves treatment retention and is also of benefit in phar-
</p>
<p>macotherapy trials (Schierenberg, van Amsterdam, van den Brink, &amp; Goudriaan, 
</p>
<p>2012). Another review (Farronato, Dursteler-Macfarland, Wiesbeck, &amp; Petitjean, 
</p>
<p>2013) concurred that positive, rapid, and enduring effects on cocaine use are reli-
</p>
<p>ably seen with CM interventions. However, the reviews also noted that it is unclear 
</p>
<p>who should cover the extra expense of CM.&nbsp; In addition, the more recent meta- 
</p>
<p>analyses (Sayegh et&nbsp;al., 2017) suggested that because CM is extrinsically focused, 
</p>
<p>it may produce follow-up effects of reducing substance use mainly in the short term.

</p>
<p>Twelve-Step Facilitation has grown because 12-step groups such as Alcoholics 
</p>
<p>Anonymous represent a readily available and no-cost resource in SUD recovery. 
</p>
<p>Individuals can become involved with 12-step programs before, during, or after 
</p>
<p>SUD treatment and in the absence of any treatment. A considerable body of evi-
</p>
<p>dence in the behavioral health field indicates that earlier engagement in 12-step 
</p>
<p>groups, more frequent meeting attendance, more involvement in 12-step prac-
</p>
<p>tices (e.g., obtaining a sponsor, performing service at meetings), and a longer 
</p>
<p>duration of participation are associated with better SUD outcomes (Kaskutas, 
</p>
<p>Bond, &amp; Avalos, 2009; Moos &amp; Moos, 2006; Wendt, Hallgren, Daley, &amp; Donovan, 
</p>
<p>2017). This kind of evidence prompted behavioral health researchers to imple-
</p>
<p>ment active methods to encourage 12-step group participation during and after 
</p>
<p>treatment.
</p>
<p>Interventions to increase 12-step group participation are effective in doing so and 
</p>
<p>thus contribute to positive SUD outcomes through their impact on increasing 12-step 
</p>
<p>group attendance and involvement. These interventions include Twelve-Step 
</p>
<p>Facilitation Therapy (Nowinski, Baker, Carroll, &amp; National Institute on Alcohol 
</p>
<p>Abuse and Alcoholism, 2007); Intensive Referral (Timko &amp; DeBenedetti, 2007); 
</p>
<p>STAGE-12, which stands for Stimulant (cocaine, methamphetamine) Abuser 
</p>
<p>Groups to Engage in 12-Step (Donovan &amp; Wells, 2007); Making AA Easier 
</p>
<p>(MAAEZ; Kaskutas, Subbaraman, Witbrodt, &amp; Zemore, 2009); and integrated 
</p>
<p>Twelve-Step Facilitation for Adolescents (Kelly et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p>Mindfulness training also is considered a promising treatment for 
</p>
<p>SUD.&nbsp; Mindfulness refers to maintaining awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily 
</p>
<p>sensations, and the surrounding environment and accepting thoughts and feelings 
</p>
<p>without judging them. When practicing mindfulness, people focus on what they are 
</p>
<p>sensing in the present moment rather than reconsidering the past or anticipating the 
</p>
<p>future.
</p>
<p>A systematic review examined methodological characteristics and findings of 
</p>
<p>studies that evaluated mindfulness treatments for SUD (Li, Howard, Garland, 
</p>
<p>McGovern, &amp; Lazar, 2017). The review also included a meta-analysis of random-
</p>
<p>ized controlled trials of mindfulness treatments for substance use. Results revealed 
</p>
<p>significant small-to-large effects of mindfulness treatments in reducing the fre-
</p>
<p>quency and severity of substance use, intensity of cravings, and severity of stress. 
</p>
<p>Although mindfulness treatment for substance use is a promising intervention, 
</p>
<p>research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which mindfulness interventions 
</p>
<p>exert their effects.
</p>
<p>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is another form of behavioral ther-
</p>
<p>apy, developed in the late 1980s, that combines mindfulness strategies with the 
</p>
<p>practice of acceptance. Its rationale is that by acknowledging and accepting nega-
</p>
<p>tive thoughts and feelings, people can learn to observe them and develop new ways 
</p>
<p>to relate to them. ACT helps people become more flexible psychologically, better 
</p>
<p>understand their personal values, and connect more to the present moment. As 
</p>
<p>applied to SUDs, patients learn more accepting and mindful ways of relating to 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>51
</p>
<p>inner experiences, rather than engaging in substance use (e.g., in response to crav-
</p>
<p>ings or to escape negative affect), while moving forward in building meaningful 
</p>
<p>patterns of activity that are inconsistent with substance use. In addition, because of 
</p>
<p>ACT&rsquo;s transdiagnostic&nbsp;approach, it can effectively target key psychological prob-
</p>
<p>lems commonly comorbid with substance use.
</p>
<p>A meta-analysis (Lee, An, Levin, &amp; Twohig, 2015) provided evidence that ACT 
</p>
<p>is likely at least as efficacious as active treatment comparisons such as CBT or 
</p>
<p>12-step therapy and that substance use abstinence may be better maintained at fol-
</p>
<p>low- up when treated with ACT over other active conditions. Thus, the results pro-
</p>
<p>vide promising, although preliminary, support for ACT as a treatment for SUDs. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, Lee et&nbsp;al. noted that, while not exclusive to ACT, novel delivery meth-
</p>
<p>ods (e.g., telehealth, computer, and phone applications) of ACT are rapidly being 
</p>
<p>explored and have shown promise. As for mindfulness interventions, further study 
</p>
<p>is needed that examines mechanisms of change that affect substance use among 
</p>
<p>patients receiving ACT.
</p>
<p>Research on treating SUDs in specialty care settings with regard to each of these 
</p>
<p>evidence-based approaches (MI, CBT, CM, 12-step facilitation, and mindfulness) 
</p>
<p>has yet to establish the extent to which one approach may be more effective than 
</p>
<p>another.
</p>
<p>So far in this chapter, we have focused on use of these approaches in treating 
</p>
<p>individuals with SUDs in the absence of other mental health disorders. We turn now 
</p>
<p>to assessing and treating individuals with both SUDs and other mental health prob-
</p>
<p>lems, due to the high frequency of co-occurring diagnoses found across healthcare 
</p>
<p>settings.
</p>
<p> Clients with&nbsp;Co-occurring Diagnoses: Assessment 
</p>
<p>and&nbsp;Treatment
</p>
<p>Population-based surveys indicate that over 8.4 million adults in the United States 
</p>
<p>have co-occurring substance use and mental disorders (Center for Behavioral Health 
</p>
<p>Statistics and Quality, 2015). Specifically, over 30% of people with mental illness, 
</p>
<p>and over 50% of people with severe mental illness, will experience a SUD in their 
</p>
<p>lifetime (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015). People diag-
</p>
<p>nosed with SUDs have high rates of co-occurring psychotic disorders and other 
</p>
<p>serious mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe major 
</p>
<p>depression and PTSD (Mueser &amp; Gingerich, 2013). Individuals with co-occurring 
</p>
<p>SUD and other mental disorders tend to have greater symptom severity and poorer 
</p>
<p>functioning, and treatment engagement and outcomes, compared to those without 
</p>
<p>such comorbidity (Burns, Teesson, &amp; O&rsquo;Neill, 2005; Merikangas &amp; Kalaydjian, 
</p>
<p>2007). Thus, the assessment and treatment of SUDs in people with mental disorders 
</p>
<p>is a high priority in behavioral treatment settings.

</p>
<p> Assessing SUDs in&nbsp;People with&nbsp;Mental Disorders
</p>
<p>Mueser and Gingerich (2013) note that it is essential that all patients with mental 
</p>
<p>disorders are accurately screened and comprehensively assessed for comorbid 
</p>
<p>SUDs. In particular, it is important to assess for any level of substance use among 
</p>
<p>patients with psychosis because they are often more sensitive to the effects of psy-
</p>
<p>choactive substances and experience relatively greater adverse effects (Lubman &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sundram, 2003). Clinicians should be aware that people with severe mental ill-
</p>
<p>nesses are highly sensitive to the effects of even modest amounts of alcohol or 
</p>
<p>drugs, such that even lower levels of use may indicate an active SUD.&nbsp;Standard 
</p>
<p>screening instruments such as the AUDIT have good sensitivity and specificity in 
</p>
<p>detecting probable SUDs among people with mental disorders.
</p>
<p> Treatment Approaches for&nbsp;Patients with&nbsp;Co-occurring Disorders
</p>
<p>The same strategies we have discussed for treating SUDs are recommended for 
</p>
<p>clients with co-occurring disorders: enhance motivation; use CBT to teach more 
</p>
<p>effective interpersonal and coping skills; use CM to reward abstinence; and encour-
</p>
<p>age participation in 12-step groups as well as practicing mindfulness (Baker, 
</p>
<p>Thornton, Hiles, Hides, &amp; Lubman, 2012; Kelly, Daley, &amp; Douaihy, 2012; Mueser 
</p>
<p>&amp; Gingerich, 2013; Timko, Sutkowi, Cronkite, Makin-Byrd, &amp; Moos, 2011).
</p>
<p>In particular, MI has robust support for establishing a therapeutic alliance 
</p>
<p>between patients with co-occurring disorders and their treatment providers (Kelly 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2012). Randomized controlled trials comparing MI to educational treatment 
</p>
<p>or treatment as usual for these patients have demonstrated significant reductions in 
</p>
<p>favor of MI for alcohol and illicit drug use and psychiatric symptoms (Westra, 
</p>
<p>Aviram, &amp; Doell, 2011). However, with regard to comorbid SUD, among people 
</p>
<p>with schizophrenia in particular, although there is an emerging supportive literature 
</p>
<p>for MI, CBT, and CM, as well as family interventions, there is a particular lack of 
</p>
<p>rigorously conducted randomized controlled trials (Cather et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>Although sequential or parallel approaches can be appropriate for patients with 
</p>
<p>co-occurring disorders, there has been recognition of their limitations. Integrated 
</p>
<p>approaches, in which both conditions are addressed simultaneously within the same 
</p>
<p>treatment, are most effective for patients with SUD mental health comorbidities 
</p>
<p>(Lubman, King, &amp; Castle, 2010; Mueser &amp; Gingerich, 2013). For example, in the 
</p>
<p>case of approaches for treating comorbid SUDs and PTSD, trauma-focused psycho-
</p>
<p>therapy delivered in the context of SUD treatment is more effective than treatment 
</p>
<p>as usual or minimal intervention in reducing PTSD and SUD symptoms (Roberts, 
</p>
<p>Roberts, Jones, &amp; Bisson, 2016). However, only 18% of SUD treatment programs 
</p>
<p>meet the criteria for services that are capable of addressing the needs of patients 
</p>
<p>with co-occurring disorders (Ford et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>C. Timko and M. A. Cucciare</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>53
</p>
<p>Beyond specific behavioral therapy approaches, principles of behavioral treat-
</p>
<p>ment for patients with co-occurring disorders are being established. These include 
</p>
<p>adopting a low-stress and harm-reduction approach, supporting functional recovery 
</p>
<p>(a worthwhile and meaningful life that is not centered on using substances), and 
</p>
<p>engaging the individual&rsquo;s social network (Haverfield, Schmidt, Ilgen, &amp; Timko, 
</p>
<p>2018).
</p>
<p>Other principles emphasize that because there is no one-size-fits-all treatment, a 
</p>
<p>flexible approach with the ability to apply specific components of care to particular 
</p>
<p>individuals is required (Lubman et&nbsp;al., 2010). That is, patients with co-occurring 
</p>
<p>disorders require creative combinations of behavioral therapy and pharmacological 
</p>
<p>interventions to provide the most effective treatment (Kelly et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>The need for flexibility of approach is prompted in part by the many combina-
</p>
<p>tions of substances and mental disorders implied by the term &ldquo;co-occurring disor-
</p>
<p>ders.&rdquo; For example, the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational 
</p>
<p>interviewing and a longer duration of care provide additional benefits for co- 
</p>
<p>occurring SUD and depression in particular (Baker et&nbsp;al., 2012; Riper et&nbsp;al., 2014). 
</p>
<p>But, for all patients with co-occurring disorders, it is vital for effective treatment to 
</p>
<p>instill hope and the belief that recovery is possible among patients, family members, 
</p>
<p>and other treatment providers (Mueser &amp; Gingerich, 2013).
</p>
<p>Although this brief review of the literature on behavioral approaches to prevent-
</p>
<p>ing and treating SUDs shows that much has been accomplished, there remain criti-
</p>
<p>cal issues that have yet to be adequately addressed. These include the coordination 
</p>
<p>of SUD services and, in particular, how to effectively transition patients with SUDs 
</p>
<p>from primary care to specialty care when needed and how to ensure that patients 
</p>
<p>maintain routine primary care when they have an episode of specialty care. We turn 
</p>
<p>to these critical issues next.
</p>
<p> Presentation of&nbsp;Critical Issues
</p>
<p>A critical issue for preventing and treating SUDs is the coordination of services 
</p>
<p>encompassed by the SBIRT model: screening; brief intervention; referral; and treat-
</p>
<p>ment. In many communities, screening and brief intervention services are lacking, 
</p>
<p>referral is fragmented and inconsistent, and specialized treatment services operate 
</p>
<p>independently of primary care and the larger healthcare system(s). A key aspect of 
</p>
<p>SBIRT is the coordination of its four components into a community&rsquo;s system of 
</p>
<p>services that links a network of early intervention and referral activities, conducted 
</p>
<p>in medical and social service settings, to specialized treatment programs (Babor 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2017; Babor et&nbsp;al., 2007). We focus on two aspects of better service coordina-
</p>
<p>tion: (1) improving SUD patients&rsquo; transitions from primary to specialty care and (2) 
</p>
<p>from specialty to primary care.

</p>
<p> Transitions from&nbsp;Primary to&nbsp;Specialty Care
</p>
<p>Unhealthy substance use is common among patients presenting to primary care set-
</p>
<p>tings. As many as 22&ndash;50% of patients presenting to primary care report at least one 
</p>
<p>symptom of hazardous alcohol use (Hawkins, Lapham, Kivlahan, &amp; Bradley, 2010; 
</p>
<p>McQuade, Levy, Yanek, Davis, &amp; Liepman, 2000), while 18&ndash;44% meet the criteria 
</p>
<p>for a lifetime or current alcohol use disorder (McQuade et&nbsp;al., 2000; Smith, Schmidt, 
</p>
<p>Allensworth-Davies, &amp; Saitz, 2010). Similarly high rates are reported of past-year 
</p>
<p>or current use of an illicit substance for nonmedical reasons (35%), and current 
</p>
<p>(13%) and lifetime (47%) drug use disorders, among persons presenting to primary 
</p>
<p>care (Smith et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Substance use may complicate the treatment of chronic health conditions 
</p>
<p>addressed in primary care, such as diabetes and hypertension (Timko, Kong, 
</p>
<p>Vittorio, &amp; Cucciare, 2016). Therefore, it is critical that primary care providers be 
</p>
<p>prepared to identify and determine appropriate treatment options for patients pre-
</p>
<p>senting with substance use. Being proficient in these skills is consistent with the 
</p>
<p>increasing use of patient-centered models of primary care that emphasize healthy 
</p>
<p>lifestyle change and management of chronic health conditions. However, providers 
</p>
<p>face considerable challenges in supporting the transition of patients with more 
</p>
<p>severe substance use from primary care to SUD care settings.
</p>
<p>Although strategies for detecting and treating risky substance use are increas-
</p>
<p>ingly being used in primary care, information about the availability of specialty 
</p>
<p>SUD care treatment options is rarely provided to patients (Williams et&nbsp;al., 2012). 
</p>
<p>For example, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) implemented a model of 
</p>
<p>detecting and providing brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care 
</p>
<p>and showed increased documentation of screening and identification of hazardous 
</p>
<p>use, as well as delivery of education about safe drinking limits and potential health 
</p>
<p>effects of harmful alcohol use (Bradley et&nbsp;al., 2006; Lapham et&nbsp;al., 2012). However, 
</p>
<p>rates of referral to specialty SUD care remained low (Lapham et&nbsp;al., 2012), with 
</p>
<p>studies finding only 10&ndash;14% of patients screening positive for hazardous alcohol 
</p>
<p>use receiving information about alcohol-related care (Lapham et&nbsp;al., 2012; Williams 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p> Factors That Impact SUD Care Transitions
</p>
<p>Patient, provider, and healthcare system characteristics may directly influence the 
</p>
<p>transition practices that impact access to and engagement in specialty SUD care. In 
</p>
<p>turn, access and engagement may be associated with better health outcomes such as 
</p>
<p>reduced substance use, abstinence, and better psychological functioning and quality 
</p>
<p>of life (Cucciare, Coleman, &amp; Timko, 2015). Of potential barriers to primary care 
</p>
<p>physicians&rsquo; specialty care referrals, patient characteristics have the largest effects 
</p>
<p>(Forrest, Nutting, von Schrader, Rohde, &amp; Starfield, 2006).
</p>
<p>C. Timko and M. A. Cucciare</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>55
</p>
<p> Patient Factors
</p>
<p>Patients&rsquo; clinical characteristics such as the presence of a drug rather than alcohol 
</p>
<p>use disorder, negative consequences of substance use, and comorbid mental disor-
</p>
<p>ders are associated with a higher likelihood of receiving specialty SUD care (Forrest 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2006; Glass et&nbsp;al., 2010; Ilgen et&nbsp;al., 2011). A common barrier to accessing 
</p>
<p>specialty SUD care is that patients&rsquo; previous treatment experiences were negative 
</p>
<p>(Mowbray, Perron, Bohnert, Krentzman, &amp; Vaughn, 2010; Perron et&nbsp; al., 2009). 
</p>
<p>Additional barriers include specialty care being inconvenient, involving a long wait 
</p>
<p>until the initial appointment, long travel distances to the site, and inflexible hours of 
</p>
<p>treatment provision (Beardsley, Wish, Fitzelle, O&rsquo;Grady, &amp; Arria, 2003; Coulson, 
</p>
<p>Ng, Geertsema, Dodd, &amp; Berk, 2009; Hoffman, Ford, Choi, Gustafson, &amp; McCarty, 
</p>
<p>2008; Laudet, Stanick, &amp; Sands, 2009; McCarty, Gustafson, Capoccia, &amp; Cotter, 
</p>
<p>2009; Mowbray et&nbsp;al., 2010; Perron et&nbsp;al., 2009; Pulford, Adams, &amp; Sheridan, 2006). 
</p>
<p>Other common barriers are lack of knowledge about the harmful effects of continued 
</p>
<p>substance use, patients&rsquo; belief that they can cope with substance use on their own or 
</p>
<p>the problem will improve by itself, and embarrassment (Mowbray et&nbsp; al., 2010; 
</p>
<p>Perron et&nbsp;al., 2009). Stigma is a significant barrier to accessing SUD treatment ser-
</p>
<p>vices; individuals may choose to conceal their substance use to avoid it (Livingston, 
</p>
<p>Milne, Fang, &amp; Amari, 2012; Woodhead, Timko, Han, &amp; Cucciare, 2018).
</p>
<p>Perceived need for SUD treatment and stronger beliefs in the benefits of SUD 
</p>
<p>treatment are facilitators of treatment entry (Falck et&nbsp;al., 2007; Kleinman, Millery, 
</p>
<p>Scimeca, &amp; Polissar, 2002; Masson et&nbsp;al., 2013). However, only small proportions 
</p>
<p>of individuals identified as having SUDs perceive a need for treatment (3&ndash;19%) 
</p>
<p>(Hedden &amp; Gfroerer, 2011; Oleski, Mota, Cox, &amp; Sareen, 2010). Patients may have 
</p>
<p>unrealistic expectations about the content or duration of care because they are not 
</p>
<p>provided opportunities to express their care preferences; therefore, these prefer-
</p>
<p>ences are not realized, to the extent possible, in patients&rsquo; care planning (Coleman 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2003). Possibly, offering a menu of potential treatment options that take 
</p>
<p>patient choice into account may be a way to increase rates of treatment entry 
</p>
<p>(Bradley &amp; Kivlahan, 2014; McCrady, Epstein, Cook, Jensen, &amp; Ladd, 2011; 
</p>
<p>McKay, 2009).
</p>
<p>Resources facilitating the transition from primary to specialty SUD care are the 
</p>
<p>patient&rsquo;s self-efficacy to obtain and engage in care, motivation to change, and social 
</p>
<p>support, including family involvement (Ball, Carroll, Canning-Ball, &amp; Rounsaville, 
</p>
<p>2006; Jackson, 2006; Kleinman et&nbsp;al., 2002; Palmer, Murphy, Piselli, &amp; Ball, 2009; 
</p>
<p>Stevens et&nbsp;al., 2008; Viggiano, Pincus, &amp; Crystal, 2012; Weisner, Mertens, Tam, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Moore, 2001).
</p>
<p> Provider Factors
</p>
<p>Provider factors that may influence patients&rsquo; transitions to SUD specialty care 
</p>
<p>include providers&rsquo; cultural competence (Masson et&nbsp;al., 2013) and knowledge about 
</p>
<p>the availability and potential efficacy of SUD treatment options both within their 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health Approaches to&nbsp;Preventing and&nbsp;Treating Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>

<p>56
</p>
<p>care system and larger community. Referrals to SUD treatment may be infrequent 
</p>
<p>because providers often view such treatment as a revolving door that does not 
</p>
<p>deliver positive outcomes (Woodhead et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>Studies confirm the stigmatizing attitudes of providers toward individuals who 
</p>
<p>need SUD treatment, in that such patients are perceived as not being truly sick (due 
</p>
<p>to the supposed self-inflicted nature of substance abuse and dependency), irrespon-
</p>
<p>sible, aggressive, untrustworthy, and difficult (Kelly &amp; Westerhoff, 2010; Schomerus 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2011; Treloar &amp; Holt, 2006). These perceptions are associated with less will-
</p>
<p>ingness to intervene with people in need of SUD-related care and a barrier to the 
</p>
<p>provision of high-quality care (Lovi &amp; Barr, 2009; Skinner, Roche, Freeman, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Addy, 2005). Healthcare staff&rsquo;s negative attitudes toward patients who would ben-
</p>
<p>efit from SUD treatment often translate into delays of patients seeking help (Kelly 
</p>
<p>&amp; Westerhoff, 2010).
</p>
<p>Primary care clinicians need to be familiar with available treatment resources for 
</p>
<p>their patients who have probable or diagnosed SUDs. Knowing about available 
</p>
<p>treatment resources, including those tailored for special populations, such as patients 
</p>
<p>with comorbid chronic health conditions, and having a clear plan to access services, 
</p>
<p>will facilitate patients&rsquo; access to care resources (Timko et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>Providers also often lack training in SUD treatment generally and in transition 
</p>
<p>practices more specifically (Childers &amp; Arnold, 2012). Formal training in transi-
</p>
<p>tional care that includes learning to communicate with providers at specialty SUD 
</p>
<p>care sites, and how to elicit and implement patient and family preferences into treat-
</p>
<p>ment plans, may also be critical for improving the care transition process. Training 
</p>
<p>in the referral process should ensure that physicians obtain the skills necessary to 
</p>
<p>expand their scope of practice when appropriate, determine when and why a patient 
</p>
<p>should be referred, and identify the type of setting to which the patient should be 
</p>
<p>sent (Forrest et&nbsp;al., 2006).
</p>
<p>There are several strategies available that have potential for helping primary care 
</p>
<p>providers facilitate the transition or linkage of patients between primary care and 
</p>
<p>substance use-related help. For example, the SBIRT approach includes a referral to 
</p>
<p>treatment component that is designed to help connect patients in need of more 
</p>
<p>intensive substance use help to such care. This includes helping patients select an 
</p>
<p>appropriate care option and navigate barriers to accessing such care. However, one 
</p>
<p>recent review suggests that this component of SBIRT (as currently designed) may 
</p>
<p>have limited effectiveness for achieving this goal (Glass et&nbsp;al., 2015), suggesting a 
</p>
<p>need for research to inform how to improve this approach for the primary care 
</p>
<p>setting.
</p>
<p>More intensive approaches to linking patients engaging in unhealthy substance 
</p>
<p>use to care include Strengths-Based Case Management which involves identifying 
</p>
<p>patient strengths to facilitate linkage to care, encouraging collaborative care 
</p>
<p>decision- making, identifying barriers to care and how to resolve them, and 
</p>
<p> monitoring progress toward care linkage over time (Rapp et&nbsp; al., 2008; Strathdee 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2006). Although this approach has been shown to improve linkage of 
</p>
<p>C. Timko and M. A. Cucciare</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>57
</p>
<p>substance- using patients to care in community settings, it has not been tested in 
</p>
<p>primary care indicating a need for research on its effectiveness in this setting.
</p>
<p> System Factors
</p>
<p>The context in which primary care is positioned, such as part of a larger healthcare 
</p>
<p>system or as a stand-alone clinic, may impact the SUD care transition process. The 
</p>
<p>likelihood of specialty referral is higher when the primary care physician is located 
</p>
<p>within a practice of larger size and a health plan with gatekeeping arrangements 
</p>
<p>(Forrest et&nbsp;al., 2006). Practices in which nurses and administrative staff can make 
</p>
<p>referrals (with physician input), and in which physicians can make referrals based 
</p>
<p>on telephone consultations with patients, have higher rates of referral than practices 
</p>
<p>without these mechanisms (Forrest et&nbsp;al., 2006).
</p>
<p>Formal relationships between care settings, and the availability of information 
</p>
<p>systems such as electronic medical records that facilitate the sharing of critical 
</p>
<p>information (e.g., care history) between care sites, will vary according to setting 
</p>
<p>location and have implications for the ability to transition patients to SUD care 
</p>
<p>options. For example, the availability of comprehensive medical records that con-
</p>
<p>tain all care received and recommended across care sites, contact information for all 
</p>
<p>providers involved in patient care, and/or co-location of SUD or mental health ser-
</p>
<p>vices will likely offer greater opportunity for clinics to improve primary care to 
</p>
<p>SUD care transitions.
</p>
<p>Together, patient, provider, and system-level factors influence whether effective 
</p>
<p>referrals are made to transition patients with more severe substance use from pri-
</p>
<p>mary care clinics to SUD specialty treatment settings. Equally critical is the referral 
</p>
<p>and transition process from specialty care &ldquo;back to&rdquo; primary care. We turn to this 
</p>
<p>topic next.
</p>
<p> Transitions from&nbsp;Specialty to&nbsp;Primary Care
</p>
<p>Ensuring that patients leaving SUD specialty treatment begin or continue to obtain 
</p>
<p>regular primary care may be associated with many important health benefits. 
</p>
<p>Patients with SUDs who regularly access primary care may experience reductions 
</p>
<p>in addiction severity (Friedmann, Zhang, Hendrickson, Stein, &amp; Gerstein, 2003), 
</p>
<p>higher abstinence rates (Weisner, Mertens, Parthasarathy, Moore, &amp; Lu, 2001), and 
</p>
<p>fewer hospitalizations (Laine et&nbsp; al., 2001). For example, detoxification patients 
</p>
<p>who had a plan to see their primary care provider had a lower rate of short-term 
</p>
<p>relapse than those who did not intend to see their physician (Griswold, Greene, 
</p>
<p>Smith, Behrens, &amp; Blondell, 2007). And patients in detoxification who received 
</p>
<p>primary care had lower odds of drug use and alcohol intoxication 2 years later 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health Approaches to&nbsp;Preventing and&nbsp;Treating Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>

<p>58
</p>
<p>(Saitz, Horton, Larson, Winter, &amp; Samet, 2005). At the post-specialty care stage, 
</p>
<p>primary care physicians can provide systematic medical and recovery checkups 
</p>
<p>(El-Guebaly, 2012).
</p>
<p>Despite the documented and potential health benefits of primary care, many 
</p>
<p>patients with SUDs fail to receive it (Gurewich, Prottas, &amp; Sirkin, 2014). Of about 
</p>
<p>6000 patients entering addiction treatment, 41% did not have a primary care physi-
</p>
<p>cian, and small proportions of patients with SUDs obtained primary care subse-
</p>
<p>quent to addiction treatment. For example, 56% of detoxification patients failed to 
</p>
<p>receive primary care in the following 2&nbsp; years (Saitz, Larson, Horton, Winter, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Samet, 2004). These findings are alarming because patients with SUDs who lack 
</p>
<p>primary care are likely to incur an increased health burden. Of SUD patients without 
</p>
<p>a primary care contact in the prior 2&nbsp;years, 61% had experienced medical problems 
</p>
<p>in the prior 30 days, 47% had one or more chronic health conditions, and 20% had 
</p>
<p>two or more chronic health conditions, with asthma and high blood pressure being 
</p>
<p>the most common (De Alba, Samet, &amp; Saitz, 2004).
</p>
<p>The increased burden of medical illness experienced by patients with SUDs not 
</p>
<p>using primary care also translates into higher use of hospital and emergency depart-
</p>
<p>ment services. Eighty percent of SUD patients without a primary care physician 
</p>
<p>reported at least one prior hospitalization due to a medical condition (De Alba et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2004). In addition, 47% of such patients reported one or more visits to an emer-
</p>
<p>gency department in the prior 6&nbsp;months (Larson, Saitz, Horton, Lloyd-Travaglini, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Samet, 2006).
</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that SUD treatment settings should actively 
</p>
<p>facilitate the continuity of, or new transition to, primary care among their patients. 
</p>
<p>Although addiction treatment settings have the potential to engage patients in pri-
</p>
<p>mary care, they are not being successfully utilized to initiate primary care linkage in 
</p>
<p>this patient population. Approaches for linking patients in addiction treatment set-
</p>
<p>tings to primary care vary in terms of the resources needed to implement them 
</p>
<p>effectively. Here, we briefly describe three evidence-based approaches to promoting 
</p>
<p>the use of primary care services among patients with SUDs. We present the 
</p>
<p>approaches from the most to the least resource intensive.
</p>
<p> Co-location of&nbsp;Primary Care and&nbsp;Specialty SUD Care
</p>
<p>One method that has been shown to improve the linkage between SUD specialty 
</p>
<p>treatment and primary care is co-location of the two care services, typically also 
</p>
<p>integrating primary care into the addiction treatment program (Friedmann et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2003; Weisner, Mertens, Parthasarathy et&nbsp;al., 2001). However, integration involves 
</p>
<p>more than simple co-location; rather, it covers the dimensions of program struc-
</p>
<p>ture and milieu; assessment, treatment, and continuity of care; and staffing and 
</p>
<p>training (McGovern, Lambert-Harris, Gotham, Claus, &amp; Xie, 2014). Such an inte-
</p>
<p>grated approach may lead to improvements in substance use outcomes (Weisner, 
</p>
<p>Mertens, Parthasarathy et&nbsp;al., 2001) and initial and longer-term use of outpatient 
</p>
<p>C. Timko and M. A. Cucciare</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>59
</p>
<p>medical care services in a wide variety of addiction treatment programs (Friedmann 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2003) and among SUD patients with chronic medical conditions (Saxon 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2006).
</p>
<p> Facilitated Referral
</p>
<p>Another method to ensure that patients begin or maintain engagement in primary 
</p>
<p>care following discharge from SUD specialty treatment is facilitated referral (Saitz 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2005; Samet et&nbsp; al., 2003; Sweeney, Samet, Larson, &amp; Saitz, 2004). This 
</p>
<p>approach involves a social worker, nurse, physician, or other staff members in an 
</p>
<p>addiction treatment setting serving in a case management role to help facilitate the 
</p>
<p>linkage of patients to off-site primary care appointments (Samet et&nbsp; al., 2003; 
</p>
<p>Sweeney et&nbsp;al., 2004). The provider first conducts a health evaluation that includes 
</p>
<p>education about the importance and potential health benefits of receiving primary 
</p>
<p>care. This is followed by facilitated referral to primary care including contacting the 
</p>
<p>patient, and family and friends if necessary, by phone after discharge to provide 
</p>
<p>reminders about upcoming primary care appointments, and to conduct appointment 
</p>
<p>rescheduling if necessary (Samet et&nbsp; al., 2003; Sweeney et&nbsp; al., 2004). The initial 
</p>
<p>appointment is made with special attention to the patient&rsquo;s preferences regarding the 
</p>
<p>physician&rsquo;s gender, particular expertise, scheduling availability, and spoken lan-
</p>
<p>guages. A detailed letter or email containing the patient&rsquo;s medical conditions is 
</p>
<p>provided to the off-site primary care clinic to support the referral process.
</p>
<p>Facilitated referral was associated with increased rates of primary care usage and 
</p>
<p>reduced substance use compared to standard care among detoxification patients 
</p>
<p>(Saitz et&nbsp;al., 2005; Samet et&nbsp;al., 2003). Although co-location and facilitated referral 
</p>
<p>within addiction treatment settings can improve linkage to primary care and health 
</p>
<p>outcomes, they are relatively resource intensive. For example, both approaches 
</p>
<p>require the inclusion of dedicated staff and, in some instances, staff with specialized 
</p>
<p>training in SUDs (Weisner, Mertens, Parthasarathy et&nbsp;al., 2001), who can provide 
</p>
<p>primary care or referral services to promote the use of primary care.
</p>
<p>Factors, such as limited addiction clinic finances, staff, staff training, and space, 
</p>
<p>make the task of improving the accessibility and engagement of primary care ser-
</p>
<p>vices within addiction treatment settings an enormous challenge for providers and 
</p>
<p>clinics (Saitz et&nbsp;al., 2005; Samet, Friedmann, &amp; Saitz, 2001). It may be feasible for 
</p>
<p>some well-resourced SUD clinics to adopt and implement a co-located primary care 
</p>
<p>clinic or facilitated referral, but widespread adoption of these strategies will likely 
</p>
<p>remain elusive. Rather, it may be more feasible for SUD specialty treatment settings 
</p>
<p>to adopt components of these approaches. Components may include providing edu-
</p>
<p>cation to patients on the benefits of seeking primary care, available care options, and 
</p>
<p>how to address insurance and coverage concerns, as well as implement follow-up 
</p>
<p>procedures such as periodic reminders via telephone or other means (email, letter) 
</p>
<p>to schedule or attend follow-up appointments. When addiction treatment settings do 
</p>
<p>not have the resources to implement co-location or facilitated referral as packaged 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health Approaches to&nbsp;Preventing and&nbsp;Treating Substance Use Disorders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>60
</p>
<p>in empirical studies, they may choose to implement components of these  intervention 
</p>
<p>approaches with the hope that some portion of effects observed in more comprehen-
</p>
<p>sive packages will generalize to their setting and patient population.
</p>
<p> Brief Counseling and&nbsp;Referral
</p>
<p>A third option, in addition to co-location and facilitated referral, to improve the 
</p>
<p>transition from specialty SUD care to primary care consists of brief approaches to 
</p>
<p>counseling and referral within the addiction treatment program. For example, 
</p>
<p>Project ASSERT was developed as a brief approach to facilitate referral to primary 
</p>
<p>care and other services for patients with SUDs presenting to emergency depart-
</p>
<p>ments (Bernstein, Bernstein, &amp; Levenson, 1997; D&rsquo;Onofrio &amp; Degutis, 2010). This 
</p>
<p>approach, delivered by case managers, could be adopted in addiction treatment set-
</p>
<p>tings. It includes the detection of SUDs, a brief counseling session based on the 
</p>
<p>principles of MI, and linkage to primary care (Bernstein et&nbsp;al., 1997; D&rsquo;Onofrio &amp; 
</p>
<p>Degutis, 2010).
</p>
<p>The counseling session consists of establishing rapport, providing feedback 
</p>
<p>and education about the importance of receiving primary care, and assessing read-
</p>
<p>iness to accept a referral using a single-item &ldquo;readiness ruler&rdquo; (1&ndash;10, with 10 indi-
</p>
<p>cating readiness). Depending on the patient&rsquo;s response, counseling follows to 
</p>
<p>either help facilitate the referral process or address ambivalence to receiving a 
</p>
<p>referral. An evaluation of this approach found that 47% of the 1096 substance-
</p>
<p>using patients enrolled in the study received a referral to primary care. Although 
</p>
<p>follow-up rates were low (22%), among those who did return for 60- and 90-day 
</p>
<p>follow-ups and had received a referral, alcohol and drug use severity was reduced 
</p>
<p>and satisfaction with the referral process was high (Bernstein et&nbsp; al., 1997; 
</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Onofrio &amp; Degutis, 2010).
</p>
<p>This approach may be promising, but the existing evidence is not yet sufficient 
</p>
<p>for demonstrating effectiveness. Studies are needed to determine whether this 
</p>
<p>approach is an effective method for transitioning SUD patients from addiction treat-
</p>
<p>ment to primary care.
</p>
<p> Significance for&nbsp;Services Delivery, Financing, and&nbsp;Research
</p>
<p>As we have noted, despite the prevalence of substance use problems, relatively few 
</p>
<p>individuals with SUDs access any form of help. In 2015, only 10.8% of the 21.7 
</p>
<p>million people who needed substance use treatment received it (Lipari, Park-Lee, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Horn, 2016). In addition, when help is sought, it often occurs 10 or more years after 
</p>
<p>the onset of symptoms of disorder.
</p>
<p>C. Timko and M. A. Cucciare</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>61
</p>
<p>As we have also noted, there are many barriers to help seeking, including the 
</p>
<p>stigma of having substance-related problems, concern that treatment is ineffective 
</p>
<p>or not private, and disinterest in abstinence goals. Many people using substances at 
</p>
<p>unhealthy levels believe that their problems are not serious and will improve  without 
</p>
<p>help or prefer to handle problems on their own. Further, factors such as family and 
</p>
<p>work responsibilities, the need for childcare and transportation, and the long dis-
</p>
<p>tance to and costs of treatment discourage help seeking.
</p>
<p>In this context of acknowledged barriers to SUD treatment, a variety of low- 
</p>
<p>intensity interventions have been developed and implemented to effectively engage 
</p>
<p>individuals and reduce substance use. These include telephone and internet-based 
</p>
<p>interventions, which attract individuals who otherwise would not seek help. These 
</p>
<p>strategies offer easier access and flexibility to individuals who use substances and 
</p>
<p>circumvent some of the barriers to entry into traditional treatment. They also offer 
</p>
<p>the potential for greater privacy, although strong encryption and other safeguards 
</p>
<p>are needed to ensure that individuals&rsquo; data remain private and confidential for 
</p>
<p>technology- based interventions. Low-intensity interventions have been shown in 
</p>
<p>research to benefit those who use alcohol harmfully as well as those with more 
</p>
<p>severe alcohol use disorders. For example, a computer-delivered CBT for SUD is an 
</p>
<p>effective adjunct to standard outpatient treatment and thus provides an important 
</p>
<p>means of making CBT more broadly available (Carroll et&nbsp;al., 2009).
</p>
<p>Low-intensity interventions can lead to subsequent help seeking and be a starting 
</p>
<p>point for personalized SUD interventions. Innovative behavioral health approaches 
</p>
<p>to SUDs use patient progress while in treatment to personalize interventions. SUD 
</p>
<p>treatments can also incorporate tailoring based on patient characteristics and prefer-
</p>
<p>ences assessed at intake to personalize care further.
</p>
<p>In an effort to examine care that explicitly considered patient preferences, pri-
</p>
<p>mary care patients who reported heavy drinking were randomly assigned to 12 
</p>
<p>months of personalized alcohol care management or usual care (Bradley et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2018). In the personalized intervention, nurse care managers offered outreach and 
</p>
<p>engagement, repeated brief counseling using MI, and shared decision-making about 
</p>
<p>treatment options and alcohol medications if desired, supported by an interdisci-
</p>
<p>plinary team. The 12-month follow-up showed that a greater proportion of patients 
</p>
<p>in the intervention group than in the usual care group received alcohol-related care. 
</p>
<p>However, no significant differences in substance use outcomes were observed. In 
</p>
<p>explaining these results, the authors noted that as part of the intervention, the trial 
</p>
<p>allowed patients to select their own drinking goals (e.g., abstinence, drinking reduc-
</p>
<p>tion). However, in light of their review of other related studies (Oslin et&nbsp;al., 2014; 
</p>
<p>Watkins et&nbsp;al., 2017), the authors suggested that to be effective, alcohol interven-
</p>
<p>tions may need to include stronger recommendations for abstinence and the use of 
</p>
<p>medications and also make evidence-based behavioral treatments available within 
</p>
<p>the primary care setting.

</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>There is potential to improve access to and coordination of SUD treatment and 
</p>
<p>improved implementation of SBIRT, which we have reviewed in this chapter, as 
</p>
<p>well as for more effective referrals and transitions across the spectrum of care, 
</p>
<p>including primary and specialty care settings, which are critical to high-quality 
</p>
<p>SUD treatment.
</p>
<p>An important addition to the implementation of SBIRT are the set of services 
</p>
<p>provided via electronic media and information technologies. Technology-based 
</p>
<p>interventions (e.g., computer- and internet-based interventions, text messaging, 
</p>
<p>interactive voice response, smartphone applications) are extending the reach of 
</p>
<p>effective behavioral treatments for SUDs both in specialty substance use treatment 
</p>
<p>and primary care settings (Tofighi, Abrantes, &amp; Stein, 2018). Advances in 
</p>
<p>technology- based interventions addressing SUDs have made possible increased 
</p>
<p>abstinence with minimal disruption to healthcare staff members and clinical work-
</p>
<p>flow (Tofighi et&nbsp;al., 2018). These interventions cover a range of services, including 
</p>
<p>screening, assessment, and brief and specialized treatment.
</p>
<p>As we have discussed, they can provide more accessible and less costly modes of 
</p>
<p>treatment than traditional modalities; that is, they help people access treatment ser-
</p>
<p>vices who would not otherwise seek them because of barriers related to geography 
</p>
<p>(living in remote areas, living in heavy traffic-congested areas, traveling or relocat-
</p>
<p>ing away from home), shame and guilt, or stigma.
</p>
<p>Technology-based help resources can be provided as a sole treatment modality or 
</p>
<p>in combination with other treatment modalities (e.g., in-person MI or CBT) and be 
</p>
<p>either dropped or added to if found ineffective for an individual patient. The help 
</p>
<p>resources of 12-step groups (e.g., Alcoholics, Narcotics, or Cocaine Anonymous, 
</p>
<p>Al-Anon Family Groups) and other mutual help group forums (SMART Recovery, 
</p>
<p>Rational Recovery, Women for Sobriety) are available online.
</p>
<p>Despite the promise of technological approaches, rigorous research should con-
</p>
<p>tinue to establish their feasibility and effectiveness for SUD prevention and treat-
</p>
<p>ment. For technology-based interventions to reach their full potential to reduce the 
</p>
<p>burden of SUDs, strategies are needed to facilitate their dissemination and imple-
</p>
<p>mentation in primary and specialty care, addressing issues of provider adoption, 
</p>
<p>financial reimbursement, integration, and patient engagement (Tofighi et&nbsp;al., 2018). 
</p>
<p>By joining together, the behavioral research, clinical provider, and consumer com-

<p>Financing of&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services: 
Insurance, Managed Care, 
and&nbsp;Reimbursement
</p>
<p>Samuel&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Zuvekas
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Behavioral health has evolved over time to largely insurance-based and insurance- 
</p>
<p>financed systems of care, becoming much more like the rest of the health-care sys-
</p>
<p>tem. Up until the 1950s, most behavioral health services were provided in state and 
</p>
<p>local long-term psychiatric hospitals and financed primarily through state and local 
</p>
<p>general revenues. The Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 added fed-
</p>
<p>eral funding for more community-based services through grants to the states. But it 
</p>
<p>was the passage of the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs in the 
</p>
<p>1960s that fundamentally altered the way behavioral health services were financed 
</p>
<p>in this country. Medicaid, in particular, created powerful incentives to provide ser-
</p>
<p>vices outside of state psychiatric facilities because only half the costs of treatment 
</p>
<p>provided in the community were paid for by the states. In contrast, states were 
</p>
<p>responsible for all of the costs of inpatient treatment in psychiatric and other long- 
</p>
<p>term facilities under the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) rule. The 
</p>
<p>federal Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) program, passed in 1956, and later 
</p>
<p>the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program in the 1970s provided further 
</p>
<p>impetus for community-based services by giving income support to those individu-
</p>
<p>als disabled by mental disorders.
</p>
<p>Private health insurance systems have also become central to the financing of 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services. Most Americans under the age of 65 obtain health insur-
</p>
<p>ance coverage through employers and unions rather than through public insurance 
</p>

</p>
<p>programs. The introduction of new classes of antidepressant in the 1980s and 1990s 
</p>
<p>led millions more Americans into treatment, the majority with private health insur-
</p>
<p>ance coverage (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2005; Zuvekas, 2001). Similarly, greater recognition 
</p>
<p>and acceptance of medication-based treatment of ADHD, anxiety, and other behav-
</p>
<p>ioral disorders have led still more Americans into treatment. The availability of both 
</p>
<p>public and private health insurance to finance medication-based and other treat-
</p>
<p>ments has considerably broadened the behavioral health systems beyond those with 
</p>
<p>the most severe and persistent mental illnesses such as bipolar disorders and 
</p>
<p>schizophrenia.
</p>
<p>The movement to insurance-based behavioral health treatment systems also 
</p>
<p>means tighter integration with the larger and constantly evolving health and social 
</p>
<p>insurance systems. Thus, changes in the Medicaid and Medicare public insurance 
</p>
<p>programs and private health plans largely drive how behavioral health services are 
</p>
<p>organized, delivered, and financed. In particular, the expansions in insurance cover-
</p>
<p>age under the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) led to some 20 million Americans 
</p>
<p>gaining insurance and, with coverage, a means of financing their behavioral health 
</p>
<p>treatment (Uberoi, Finegold, &amp; Gee, 2016). The ACA also extended the 2008 
</p>
<p>Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) requiring equivalent 
</p>
<p>coverage (or parity) between behavioral health and other health-care services and 
</p>
<p>contained other important protections for behavioral health treatment (Barry, 
</p>
<p>Goldman, &amp; Huskamp, 2016; Beronio, Glied, &amp; Frank, 2014).
</p>
<p>The principal goals of this chapter are to (1) understand how insurance-based 
</p>
<p>models of financing operate in theory and in practice and (2) understand the impli-
</p>
<p>cations of increasing strains on private and public insurance systems, including the 
</p>
<p>ACA insurance expansions and parity, for the future of behavioral health services.
</p>
<p> Review of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Literature
</p>
<p> Paying for&nbsp;Behavioral Health Treatment
</p>
<p>Funding for behavioral health treatment comes from a complex array of public and 
</p>
<p>private sources (SAMHSA, 2016), predominantly insurance-based. An estimated 
</p>
<p>$220 billion was spent on behavioral health in 2014, accounting for 7.5% of all 
</p>
<p>health-care spending in the United States (see Table&nbsp;1). Public and private health 
</p>
<p>plans together paid 64% of behavioral health care in 2014, up from 45% in 1986. In 
</p>
<p>comparison, insurance financed 74% of all non-behavioral health spending in 2014 
</p>
<p>(Mark et&nbsp; al., 2016; SAMHSA, 2016). Private insurance coverage (26%) and 
</p>
<p>Medicaid (24%) each accounted for about a quarter of all behavioral health spend-
</p>
<p>ing in 2014, followed by Medicare (14%). Medicaid is a more important source of 
</p>
<p>financing for behavioral health services compared to other health-care services, 
</p>
<p>while Medicare and private insurance plans are less important.

</p>
<p>It is important to note that the trend toward insurance-based financing of treat-
</p>
<p>ment over the last couple of decades extends mainly to mental health treatment 
</p>
<p>services and not substance use disorders (Mark et&nbsp;al., 2016). The majority of fund-
</p>
<p>ing for substance use disorders still comes from public sources other than Medicare 
</p>
<p>and Medicaid and is unchanged over the last couple of decades (Mark et&nbsp;al., 2016; 
</p>
<p>SAMHSA, 2016). Other sources of funding are still important for mental health 
</p>
<p>treatment as well. State and local authorities still accounted for 16% of all behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health spending in 2014 apart from Medicaid (Table&nbsp;1). Other federal sources, 
</p>
<p>including Veterans Affairs, military health care, the Indian Health Services, and the 
</p>
<p>$2.3 billion in SAMHSA block grants (SAMHSA, 2015) to state and local agencies, 
</p>
<p>accounted for 7% of all behavioral health spending. Patients and their families 
</p>
<p>financed 10% of all behavioral health care themselves out-of-pocket, while other 
</p>
<p>private sources accounted for 3%.
</p>
<p> Where Do Treatment Dollars Go?
</p>
<p>Behavioral health treatment today is largely community-based. Only about one in 
</p>
<p>four behavioral health treatment dollars was spent in specialty psychiatric and gen-
</p>
<p>eral hospitals in 2014, down from 43% in 1986 (Table&nbsp;2). Because these aggregate

<p>figures for hospitals also include outpatient and partial day treatment, the amount 
</p>
<p>spent on inpatient treatment is even less. Spending in psychiatric specialty hospitals 
</p>
<p>now accounts for less than 1 of every 10 behavioral health-care dollars, down from 
</p>
<p>23% in 1986. Much of the drop was due to the rapid growth of specialty managed 
</p>
<p>behavioral health-care organizations (MBHOs) during the 1980s and 1990s. 
</p>
<p>MBHOs achieved cost savings primarily by promoting outpatient care in place of 
</p>
<p>more expensive inpatient treatment (Ma &amp; McGuire, 1998; National Advisory 
</p>
<p>Mental Health Council, 2000; Sturm, 1997). However, administrative costs of insur-
</p>
<p>ance have increased as a by-product of increased management of behavioral health 
</p>
<p>services. That is, over time proportionately fewer dollars are going to direct patient 
</p>
<p>care.
</p>
<p>Spending on psychiatrists has grown less rapidly than spending on other behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health professionals (Table&nbsp; 2). The nonpsychiatric physician share of total 
</p>
<p>spending remains only about 5%. However, these aggregate estimates may under-
</p>
<p>state the true amount spent on primary care physicians because behavioral health 
</p>
<p>services and diagnoses are often not coded as such in the insurance claims data that 
</p>
<p>form the basis for these estimates. In fact, the majority of people receiving behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health services get their care from nonspecialist providers, although they tend

<p>to have many fewer visits on average than people who receive services from special-
</p>
<p>ists (Wang et&nbsp;al., 2005).
</p>
<p>Prescription medications account for about a quarter of all behavioral health 
</p>
<p>spending (Table&nbsp;2). Spending on medications grew rapidly from the 1980s through 
</p>
<p>the turn of the century with the introduction of expensive new classes of antidepres-
</p>
<p>sants, antipsychotics, and other behavioral health-related medications. These newer 
</p>
<p>medications were many times more costly than older medications. Equally, if not 
</p>
<p>more important, many more people were prescribed psychotropic medications. 
</p>
<p>Spending on behavioral health medications has moderated over the last decade as 
</p>
<p>generic versions of most of these medications became available and the growth in 
</p>
<p>the number of Americans taking them flattened out.
</p>
<p> Principles of&nbsp;Insurance
</p>
<p>The main function of insurance is to protect people from financial risk when catas-
</p>
<p>trophe strikes. In this sense, health insurance is much like automobile, homeowners, 
</p>
<p>or life insurance. Instead of paying a fixed amount to your family if you die under a 
</p>
<p>life insurance policy or paying to rebuild your house, health insurance helps pay 
</p>
<p>medical bills when you are sick. When private health insurance plans first began in 
</p>
<p>the 1940s and 1950s, they principally covered inpatient hospital stays. As other 
</p>
<p>services grew in importance and expense, coverage expanded to include physician 
</p>
<p>and other provider expenses and, more recently, prescription drugs. As late as the 
</p>
<p>1970s, many private plans did not offer prescription drug coverage&mdash;now it is 
</p>
<p>almost universal. Likewise, Medicare did not offer the Part D prescription drug 
</p>
<p>benefit until 2006&mdash;now approximately 86% of Medicare beneficiaries have drug 
</p>
<p>coverage (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018a). Health insurance, however, differs in 
</p>
<p>crucial ways from other common types of insurance (Arrow, 1963).
</p>
<p> Principles of&nbsp;Insurance: Moral Hazard
</p>
<p>Health insurance contracts tend to be more open-ended than other types of insurance 
</p>
<p>contracts because it is difficult to predict beforehand which of the many different 
</p>
<p>types of illnesses you might get and how much health care you might need. That is, 
</p>
<p>health insurance contracts are rarely written in such a way that if I get, say, leukemia, 
</p>
<p>I will be paid a fixed $200,000, or if I get pneumonia, I will be paid $10,000. The 
</p>
<p>open-ended nature of health insurance coverage leads to a situation that economists 
</p>
<p>call moral hazard, where people overconsume health care. With health insurance 
</p>
<p>coverage, out-of-pocket costs are generally less than the true cost of providing health 
</p>
<p>care. At some point, the benefits of additional health-care services (e.g., extra tests) 
</p>
<p>in terms of improving health are not worth their full costs, but because the insured 
</p>
<p>only pay a fraction of the costs, they still want to use the services to get better.

<p>76
</p>
<p>Consumer cost-sharing evolved in response to this fundamental problem of 
</p>
<p>moral hazard. By shifting at least some of the costs of health care to consumers, they 
</p>
<p>become more sensitive to the true costs of health care. Current health-care reform 
</p>
<p>discussions often refer to this idea as consumers having &ldquo;skin in the game.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Traditionally, health insurance plans imposed a deductible, where the health insur-
</p>
<p>ance plan only paid for services after consumers had paid a certain amount out of 
</p>
<p>their own pockets (typically, $250 or $500). More recently, high-deductible health 
</p>
<p>plans (HDHP), where health-care services, except for a limited set of preventive 
</p>
<p>care services, are only covered after a deductible of $1350 or higher in 2018 is met 
</p>
<p>(most often considerably higher), have become popular with employers (AHRQ, 
</p>
<p>2017; Claxton, Rae, Long, Damico, Foster, Whitmore,&nbsp;2017).
</p>
<p>Health plans also traditionally imposed cost-sharing in the form of coinsurance, 
</p>
<p>where the consumer paid, typically, 20% of the cost of services (after the deductible 
</p>
<p>had been met) and the plan 80%. As health insurance plans evolved, fixed co- 
</p>
<p>payments for particular services, for example, $25 for an office visit or $35 for a 
</p>
<p>brand-name prescription drug, have become common. While consumer cost-sharing 
</p>
<p>can reduce excess use of health-care services, it can also reduce appropriate use of 
</p>
<p>health-care services (Goldman, Dirani, Fastenau, &amp; Conrad, 2014; Rice &amp; Matsuoka, 
</p>
<p>2004). Thus, there is always a trade-off between the benefits of more generous 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage and moral hazard. The goal with cost-sharing is to strike a bal-
</p>
<p>ance in this trade-off (Besley, 1988; Zeckhauser, 1970).
</p>
<p>The best-known evidence regarding moral hazard in health insurance coverage 
</p>
<p>comes from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE), a large-scale, random-
</p>
<p>ized control trial conducted from 1977 to 1982. This landmark study found that 
</p>
<p>consumers&rsquo; use of mental health services was twice as responsive to their out-of- 
</p>
<p>pocket price as other medical services (Keeler, Manning, &amp; Wells, 1988). The 
</p>
<p>RAND HIE results became the main justification for providing less generous cover-
</p>
<p>age for mental health services on economic efficiency grounds: moral hazard is 
</p>
<p>greater where consumers are more sensitive to the price of services. However, sev-
</p>
<p>eral lines of evidence suggest that consumers are no longer as sensitive to the price 
</p>
<p>of outpatient mental health services as they were four decades ago when treatment 
</p>
<p>options were more limited (Goldman et&nbsp;al., 2006; Meyerhoefer &amp; Zuvekas, 2010).
</p>
<p> Principles of&nbsp;Insurance: Adverse and&nbsp;Favorable Risk Selection
</p>
<p>Economists refer to moral hazard as a type of market failure because it leads to less 
</p>
<p>than 100% insurance coverage. Risk selection can lead to even more serious market 
</p>
<p>failure. Consumers with greater anticipated health needs are naturally more moti-
</p>
<p>vated to seek insurance coverage to cover the costs of services, and the more gener-
</p>
<p>ous the coverage the better. This will drive up costs in plans that attract 
</p>
<p>sicker-than-average patients (adverse selection). Insurers can respond by raising 
</p>
<p>premiums, restricting coverage so as not to attract higher-risk consumers, and/or 
</p>
<p>using other means to discourage higher-risk consumers. If insurers raise premiums, 
</p>
<p>S. H. Zuvekas</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>77
</p>
<p>this can lead to a situation where the healthier consumers drop coverage (because it 
</p>
<p>is no longer as good a deal). This causes premiums to go still higher, in turn, causing 
</p>
<p>the next-healthiest consumers to drop coverage and so on (Rothschild &amp; Stiglitz, 
</p>
<p>1976). In the extreme, this can lead to an insurance &ldquo;death spiral,&rdquo; where the insur-
</p>
<p>ance market ceases to exist altogether, something that has been observed in the real 
</p>
<p>world (Cutler &amp; Reber, 1998; Cutler &amp; Zeckhauser, 1998).
</p>
<p>Adverse selection is thought to be especially acute in behavioral health (Frank, 
</p>
<p>Glazer, &amp; McGuire, 2000; Frank &amp; McGuire, 2000; McGuire, 2016; Montz et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2016). Consumers with behavioral health disorders have much higher medical costs 
</p>
<p>on average than other consumers and are thus unattractive risks from a health plan&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>perspective. For example, depression frequently co-occurs with diabetes and heart 
</p>
<p>disease. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program during the 1960s 
</p>
<p>and 1970s provides the classic illustration of adverse selection (Frank et&nbsp;al., 2000; 
</p>
<p>Padgett, Patrick, Burns, Schlesinger, &amp; Cohen, 1993). Federal employees have long 
</p>
<p>had the choice of a number of health plans through the FEHBP. Several of the plans 
</p>
<p>in the FEHBP began offering generous mental health coverage, others did not. Not 
</p>
<p>surprisingly, consumers with behavioral health disorders migrated to the more gen-
</p>
<p>erous plans, which raised costs. In response, the generous plans cut their behavioral 
</p>
<p>health-care coverage so that coverage was low in all the plans by the late 1970s. 
</p>
<p>Behavioral health coverage remained low in the federal health plans until 2001, 
</p>
<p>when an executive order mandating parity coverage in all plans went into effect 
</p>
<p>(Goldman et&nbsp;al., 2006).
</p>
<p>Regulatory actions, such as parity mandates, are one potential solution to adverse 
</p>
<p>selection. Risk adjustment, where payments vary according to the risk the plan faces 
</p>
<p>in their population, is another standard approach to mitigating adverse selection. 
</p>
<p>Risk adjustment is used, for example, in the payments made to Medicare and 
</p>
<p>Medicaid managed care plans and in the ACA private insurance marketplaces. 
</p>
<p>Much work has gone into devising better risk-adjustment methodologies over the 
</p>
<p>last few decades, but they remain imperfect: predicting future medical expenditures 
</p>
<p>is inherently difficult. With imperfect adjustments for risks, insurance plans have 
</p>
<p>strong incentives to seek out better risks (favorable selection, often referred to as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;cream skimming&rdquo; or &ldquo;cherry picking&rdquo;) and avoid sicker patients.
</p>
<p>Mechanisms to induce pooling of consumers are another potential means for 
</p>
<p>mitigating adverse selection. The dominance of employment-related health insur-
</p>
<p>ance arose partly by accident as employers used health insurance coverage as a 
</p>
<p>means to attract and retain high-quality workers, much like retirement benefits. But 
</p>
<p>public policy has also deliberately encouraged this development. Employer groups 
</p>
<p>are seen as a convenient way to pool consumers independent of their health status. 
</p>
<p>The value of health insurance benefits is not taxed, creating incentives for employ-
</p>
<p>ers to provide, and employees to receive, compensation in the form of health insur-
</p>
<p>ance benefits, rather than higher wages, which are taxable. Some argue that this tax 
</p>
<p>subsidy encourages too much insurance and overconsumption of medical care due 
</p>
<p>to moral hazard. The ACA, for example, contains provisions to tax &ldquo;Cadillac&rdquo; plans 
</p>
<p>above a certain threshold, although its implementation has been continually delayed. 
</p>
<p>Other reform proposals would eliminate the tax subsidy altogether. Others argue 
</p>
<p>Financing of&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services: Insurance, Managed Care, and&nbsp;Reimbursement</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>78
</p>
<p>that it is the glue that keeps the employment-related insurance system together and 
</p>
<p>that the system might fall apart altogether due to adverse selection as the healthier 
</p>
<p>workers opt out without the subsidy (Bernard &amp; Selden, 2002; Monheit &amp; Selden, 
</p>
<p>2000).
</p>
<p> Principles of&nbsp;Insurance: Social Insurance
</p>
<p>The Medicare and Medicaid programs that finance much of behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices and the SSDI and SSI programs that provide many with severe and persistent 
</p>
<p>mental illness with income support are examples of social insurance programs. 
</p>
<p>Social insurance programs serve two primary purposes: (1) they are a means of 
</p>
<p>overcoming market failure in private markets; and (2) they serve a redistributive 
</p>
<p>function in providing safety net resources to vulnerable populations.
</p>
<p>The Medicare program, enacted in 1965, serves both functions. Medicare Part A, 
</p>
<p>which covers hospital services, was made compulsory explicitly to overcome 
</p>
<p>adverse selection problems and is funded primarily out of payroll taxes. Nearly all 
</p>
<p>people 65 and older are covered by Part A.&nbsp;Medicare, after a 2-year waiting period, 
</p>
<p>also covers those under the age of 65 who have qualified for the SSDI program 
</p>
<p>(those with a disability who paid into the Social Security System for 40 or more 
</p>
<p>quarters).
</p>
<p>The Medicare Part B program, which covers office-based and other services, 
</p>
<p>while not compulsory, is funded 25% out of Medicare beneficiaries&rsquo; own pockets 
</p>
<p>and 75% out of general revenues.
</p>
<p>The premiums for the optional Medicare Part D drug benefit are similarly heav-
</p>
<p>ily subsidized, encouraging high rates of participation, as well. Substantial penalties 
</p>
<p>for late enrollment in Medicare Part B and Part D further encourage participation. 
</p>
<p>The large subsidies combined with late enrollment penalties have also been effec-
</p>
<p>tive in overcoming adverse selection: 86% of Medicare beneficiaries eligible for 
</p>
<p>Part D prescription drug coverage have some form of drug coverage (Kaiser Family 
</p>
<p>Foundation, 2018a).
</p>
<p>The Medicaid program, unlike Medicare, was not designed to provide broad- 
</p>
<p>based coverage for the population but as an insurer of last resort for vulnerable 
</p>
<p>populations. It has long provided coverage to low-income children and their parents 
</p>
<p>(many with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families), low-income pregnant 
</p>
<p>women, low-income elderly, and people with disabilities. Eligibility varies widely 
</p>
<p>by state. The 2010 ACA significantly expanded Medicaid coverage to childless 
</p>
<p>adults and other low-income adult populations in states that chose to expand 
</p>
<p>coverage.
</p>
<p>Medicaid is an especially important source of coverage for people with mental 
</p>
<p>disorders who qualify for SSI income support (many of whom do not have the 40 
</p>
<p>quarters of work needed to qualify for SSDI and, thus, Medicare). It also plays an 
</p>
<p>important role in filling in gaps for Medicare, which requires significant cost- sharing 
</p>
<p>and does not cover many behavioral health services.

</p>
<p>Concerns regarding the potential loss of Medicaid and Medicare coverage create 
</p>
<p>strong disincentives for people with disabilities to seek work and incentives to stay 
</p>
<p>on social insurance programs and have led to a number of initiatives, such as the 
</p>
<p>Ticket to Work program (Office of Disability Employment Policy, 2007).
</p>
<p> Principles of&nbsp;Insurance: Managed Care
</p>
<p>Managed care is ubiquitous in health care, no more so than in behavioral health 
</p>
<p>treatment. But it also takes many different forms and is hard to categorize, espe-
</p>
<p>cially with the extensive hybridization of models in recent years. Managed care 
</p>
<p>evolved as another way to control the use of health-care services and restrain cost 
</p>
<p>increases, which continued to rise rapidly in spite of the widespread use of con-
</p>
<p>sumer cost-sharing in health insurance plans.
</p>
<p>Traditional staff/group model Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), such 
</p>
<p>as Kaiser Permanente of Northern California and Group Health of Puget Sound, 
</p>
<p>pioneered many of the basic managed care techniques. These staff/group model 
</p>
<p>HMOs offered substantially reduced consumer cost-sharing compared to traditional 
</p>
<p>fee-for-service (FFS) plans in return for (1) restrictive provider networks, with pro-
</p>
<p>viders either salaried directly by the HMO or members of large groups contracted 
</p>
<p>principally with the HMO; (2) physician gatekeeping, that is, requiring a referral 
</p>
<p>from the patient&rsquo;s primary care provider to see specialists; (3) extensive utilization 
</p>
<p>controls, such as prior authorization for services such as inpatient hospitals stays, 
</p>
<p>physical therapy, and behavioral health services; and (4) drug formularies, where 
</p>
<p>HMOs frequently offered market exclusivity to manufacturers in return for price 
</p>
<p>breaks on specific drugs.
</p>
<p>Traditional indemnity insurance has all but disappeared in private health insur-
</p>
<p>ance markets, supplanted by HMO plans, preferred provider organization (PPO) 
</p>
<p>plans, and hybrid plans. PPOs consist of networks of providers, who provide ser-
</p>
<p>vices to plan members at a discounted price negotiated with the PPO.&nbsp;Consumer 
</p>
<p>cost-sharing is much lower for network (&ldquo;preferred&rdquo;) providers, but consumers have 
</p>
<p>a choice of whether to use in-network providers or pay more for out-of-network 
</p>
<p>providers. In contrast, in a closed HMO, consumers must use HMO providers or 
</p>
<p>face denial of benefits (the HMO may either hire the provider directly as in a staff/
</p>
<p>group model HMO or contract with individual and groups of providers). PPOs also 
</p>
<p>differ from closed HMOs in that they generally do not require referrals to access 
</p>
<p>physician specialists. Some insurers offer both HMO and PPO products using the 
</p>
<p>exact same network of providers, differing mainly in the use of physician gatekeep-
</p>
<p>ing and the ability to use of out-of-network providers.
</p>
<p>Point-of-service (POS) plans contain elements of both HMO and PPO plans. For 
</p>
<p>example, an &ldquo;open-ended&rdquo; HMO plan might allow consumers to see out-of-network 
</p>
<p>providers (with higher cost-sharing) but still require referrals for specialists 
</p>
<p>(gatekeeping).

<p>80
</p>
<p>HMOs enjoyed rapid growth into the late 1990s, doubling from 39.0 million 
</p>
<p>enrollees in 1992 to a peak of 80.5 million in 1999 (Interstudy, 2002, 2003). A man-
</p>
<p>aged care &ldquo;backlash&rdquo; subsequently led to a decline in HMO enrollment to 71 mil-
</p>
<p>lion in 2006 (Interstudy, 2007). However, HMO enrollment has since risen to 92 
</p>
<p>million enrollees as of 2016 primarily due to increases among Medicare and 
</p>
<p>Medicaid populations (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018b). PPOs grew rapidly in the 
</p>
<p>1990s and 2000s and remain the most popular type of plan in the employer- 
</p>
<p>sponsored insurance markets.
</p>
<p>In contrast to private health insurance, Medicare remains largely a traditional 
</p>
<p>fee-for-service program. Managed care plans were first introduced in the Medicare 
</p>
<p>program in 1990. Enrollment in what are now called Medicare Advantage (Medicare 
</p>
<p>Part C) plans has grown unevenly over time. However, it has accelerated recently 
</p>
<p>with the introduction of new options reaching 34% of the Medicare population in 
</p>
<p>2018 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2018b).
</p>
<p>State Medicaid programs continue to shift Medicaid recipients into managed 
</p>
<p>care plans. In 1997, almost half (48%) of Medicaid recipients were enrolled in man-
</p>
<p>aged care plans, mostly in HMOs. By 2013, this had grown to 80% of all Medicaid 
</p>
<p>recipients (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2016).
</p>
<p>Outside of the fee-for-service Medicare program, the majority of specialty 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services for insured populations are organized and delivered 
</p>
<p>through managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs). Medicaid programs 
</p>
<p>and private insurers alike contract with these specialty MBHOs, in what are termed 
</p>
<p>behavioral health carve-outs. MBHOs generally develop their own networks of 
</p>
<p>behavioral health specialists, usually reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis, along 
</p>
<p>with extensive prior authorization and utilization review systems. Products mar-
</p>
<p>keted to both employers (direct carve-out) and health plans (indirect carve-out) 
</p>
<p>range from employee assistance plans (EAP) to stand-alone utilization management 
</p>
<p>products to comprehensive packages providing all specialty behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices (network plus utilization management).
</p>
<p>MBHOs spread rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s by successfully adapting 
</p>
<p>many of the techniques originally pioneered by HMOs to the management of spe-
</p>
<p>cialty behavioral health services. Industry sources show total enrollment in MBHO 
</p>
<p>products increasing from 86 million in 1992 to an astounding 227 million in 2002 
</p>
<p>(Open Minds, 2002). MBHOs achieved impressive cost savings early on due pri-
</p>
<p>marily to dramatically reduced lengths of stays for inpatient hospitalizations (Ma &amp; 
</p>
<p>McGuire, 1998; National Advisory Mental Health Council, 1998, 2000; Sturm, 
</p>
<p>1997). This success led more and more plans and employers to contract with 
</p>
<p>MBHOs. MBHOs also achieved cost savings partly through negotiated discounts 
</p>
<p>from network providers and partly through what are termed &ldquo;network&rdquo; effects: the 
</p>
<p>fear that a provider will be discontinued from the network if they provide too many 
</p>
<p>services to patients (Ma &amp; McGuire, 2004). Their growth, however, naturally 
</p>
<p>reached a plateau as they came to dominate the market for specialty behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services provided through insurance in the last couple of decades.
</p>
<p>MBHOs&rsquo; effects on access and quality of behavioral health services remain 
</p>
<p>ambiguous. On balance, reducing lengthy inpatient stays and shifting resources to

</p>
<p>outpatient settings has likely been beneficial to patients. There is also evidence that 
</p>
<p>MBHOs accelerated the diffusion of evidence-based practices (Ling Davina, Berndt, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Frank, 2007). But there are also concerns that MBHOs restrict access to specialty 
</p>
<p>services, so that patients must seek treatment in primary care settings. MBHOs are 
</p>
<p>also rarely at risk for the costs of psychotropic medications (management of pre-
</p>
<p>scription medications are generally contracted to yet another third party, see below). 
</p>
<p>This creates incentives for psychotropic medication interventions, at the possible 
</p>
<p>expense of evidence-based behavioral therapies (the cost for which they would be 
</p>
<p>responsible). Evidence of cost shifting either to primary care settings or to prescrip-
</p>
<p>tion drugs, however, is mixed (Dickey, Normand, Norton, Rupp, &amp; Azeni, 2001; 
</p>
<p>Norton, Lindrooth, &amp; Dickey, 1997; Zuvekas, Rupp, &amp; Norquist, 2007).
</p>
<p>Once a somewhat peripheral concern, prescription drug financing is now central 
</p>
<p>to behavioral health treatment. Similar to specialty behavioral health services, man-
</p>
<p>agement of prescription drugs in the private plans, including plans that serve 
</p>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid populations, is now largely contracted out to third-party 
</p>
<p>administrators called pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Also similar to MBHOs, 
</p>
<p>PBMs contract directly with employers who have carved out their prescription ben-
</p>
<p>efits from the rest of their health coverage.
</p>
<p>PBMs apply many of the basic tools of managed care to prescription medica-
</p>
<p>tions. They develop and maintain networks of pharmacies with which they negotiate 
</p>
<p>prices. They negotiate discounts and rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
</p>
<p>and wholesalers. Much like MBHOs, the PBM industry is highly concentrated, so 
</p>
<p>PBMs are able to leverage their volume purchasing power with both pharmacies and 
</p>
<p>manufacturers. Leverage with manufacturers is further increased through the use of 
</p>
<p>drug formularies, essentially lists of approved drugs.
</p>
<p>Multi-tiered formularies are the norm and, in private plans, are closely tied to 
</p>
<p>consumer cost-sharing. In a standard three-tier plan, the first tier includes inexpen-
</p>
<p>sive generic medications with zero or low co-payment levels to encourage their use. 
</p>
<p>The second tier includes a preferred medication(s) in a therapeutic class, with some-
</p>
<p>what higher cost-sharing. The third tier includes non-preferred medications in a 
</p>
<p>therapeutic class, with the highest cost-sharing.
</p>
<p>Not all medications in a therapeutic class will necessarily appear in a formulary; 
</p>
<p>formularies vary widely in their restrictiveness. Some particularly expensive medi-
</p>
<p>cations, such as cancer drugs and atypical antipsychotics, may be listed but require 
</p>
<p>prior authorization before use. PBMs, managed care plans that manage their own 
</p>
<p>pharmacy benefits and Medicaid programs, use the leverage of tiers or preferred 
</p>
<p>status of drugs, in return for discounts and rebates from manufacturers.
</p>
<p>The treatment of psychotropic medications in drug formularies is an area of great 
</p>
<p>controversy. Patients respond differently to the range of medications within thera-
</p>
<p>peutic classes such as antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics. A restrictive for-
</p>
<p>mulary can thus create barriers to treatment for patients who do not respond to 
</p>
<p>preferred drugs.
</p>
<p>Consumer cost-sharing can also create barriers to treatment. Higher cost-sharing 
</p>
<p>can lead to reduced use of medications (Goldman et&nbsp; al., 2004; Hodgkin, Parks 
</p>
<p>Thomas, Simoni-Wastila, Ritter, &amp; Lee, 2008; Huskamp et&nbsp;al., 2005; Landsman, Yu,

</p>
<p>Liu, Teutsch, &amp; Berger, 2005; Wang et&nbsp;al., 2008). In recognition of this potential 
</p>
<p>problem, some employers and health plans have experimented with lower cost- 
</p>
<p>sharing or eliminating it altogether for maintenance medications used to treat 
</p>
<p>chronic conditions. For additional information on the topic of psychopharmacology, 
</p>
<p>see chapter &ldquo;Pharmacy Services in Behavioral Health&rdquo; in this volume.
</p>
<p> Principles of&nbsp;Reimbursement
</p>
<p>Private health plans, public insurance programs, and state and local mental health 
</p>
<p>authorities face difficult decisions in choosing how to organize and pay for health- 
</p>
<p>care services provided to clients. A wide variety of reimbursement mechanisms has 
</p>
<p>evolved over time. Each creates its own set of incentives, good and bad.
</p>
<p>Closed systems, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), state and local 
</p>
<p>psychiatric institutions, and the original staff/group HMOs typically own their own 
</p>
<p>hospitals and clinics. That is, these closed systems combine insurance functions and 
</p>
<p>health-care provision functions. They also typically hire providers directly, paying 
</p>
<p>them a salary, or use other similar contractual methods to provide care. In principal, 
</p>
<p>monitoring of provider behavior and patient outcomes is easier in a closed system, 
</p>
<p>and providers can be made to more closely follow the dictates of the organization if 
</p>
<p>their salary depends on it (either explicitly or implicitly). Success depends upon the 
</p>
<p>strength of internal monitoring systems and organizational dynamics. In the public 
</p>
<p>sector, political considerations also play a large role. Closed systems have other 
</p>
<p>problems. The large investments needed to build, maintain, and staff closed sys-
</p>
<p>tems, even in the private sector, reduce flexibility to shift resources as circumstances 
</p>
<p>change. Many consumers also dislike the restricted choice of providers in closed 
</p>
<p>systems.
</p>
<p>The many variants of cost-based and fee-for-service reimbursement are adminis-
</p>
<p>tratively simpler alternatives to directly hiring providers. Cost-based reimburse-
</p>
<p>ment, where providers submit their actual costs, was once common for hospital 
</p>
<p>services but is now the exception. Medicare, for example, paid hospitals on a strictly 
</p>
<p>retrospective cost basis until 1982 (Hodgkin &amp; McGuire, 1994). Under a fee-for- 
</p>
<p>service system, providers receive a fixed amount for each service performed. This 
</p>
<p>fee is administratively set in the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs 
</p>
<p>(although providers can indirectly influence fee setting through the political pro-
</p>
<p>cess). In private plans, the fees are usually set in negotiation with providers.
</p>
<p>However, a significant percentage of behavioral health providers, especially in 
</p>
<p>large metropolitan areas, have opted out of all insurance-based reimbursement, 
</p>
<p>focusing on clients who pay up front out of their own pockets (with some patients 
</p>
<p>filing claims with health plans and some declining to do so) at rates set by the pro-
</p>
<p>viders (Bishop, Press, Keyhani, &amp; Pincus, 2014; Cummings, 2015; Mitchell, 1991; 
</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Malley &amp; Reschovsky, 2006; Wilk, West, Narrow, Rae, &amp; Regier, 2005). Other 
</p>
<p>providers opt out of specific plans, most commonly Medicaid plans, because of low 
</p>
<p>reimbursement rates set by many states (Cunningham &amp; Hadley, 2008; Mitchell, 
</p>
<p>S. H. Zuvekas</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>83
</p>
<p>1991; Zuckerman, McFeeters, Cunningham, &amp; Nichols, 2004). The declining num-
</p>
<p>ber of providers willing to treat patients with Medicaid raises concerns that access 
</p>
<p>to care for individuals with low incomes and disabilities has diminished (Atherly &amp; 
</p>
<p>Mortensen, 2014; Cohen &amp; Cunningham, 1995; Cunningham &amp; Hadley, 2008; 
</p>
<p>Decker, 2012; Sharma et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>Cost-based and fee-for-service reimbursement also create incentives to over- 
</p>
<p>provide services, as providers earn more revenue the more services they perform as 
</p>
<p>long as the actual reimbursement amount covers their costs. For example, there is 
</p>
<p>substantial evidence that paying hospitals fixed per diem rates creates incentives for 
</p>
<p>longer lengths of stay (Berenson, Upadhyay, Delbanco, &amp; Murray, 2016, April; 
</p>
<p>Hodgkin &amp; McGuire, 1994). Actual costs tend to be front-loaded, so patients 
</p>
<p>become increasingly profitable the longer they stay. Perversely, cost-based and fee- 
</p>
<p>for- service reimbursement can even create incentives for poor quality care, since 
</p>
<p>there are often no real consequences for bad outcomes and providers can earn still 
</p>
<p>more revenue correcting their mistakes.
</p>
<p>Fee-for-service systems have the additional disadvantage of distorting treatment 
</p>
<p>decisions, as some types of services are more profitable than others. For example, 
</p>
<p>primary care providers are rarely separately reimbursed for screening for depres-
</p>
<p>sion, addiction, and other behavioral health disorders, while they are routinely reim-
</p>
<p>bursed for laboratory tests, a significant barrier to wide-scale behavioral health 
</p>
<p>screening.
</p>
<p>Capitation and other prospective payment systems were developed in response to 
</p>
<p>the poor incentives created under fee-for-service or cost-based reimbursement sys-
</p>
<p>tems. The basic idea is to shift some or all of the financial risk of additional services 
</p>
<p>to providers, creating incentives to be as efficient as possible in providing services. 
</p>
<p>Capitation to health plans and capitation to providers are commonly confused. 
</p>
<p>Under provider capitation, providers receive a fixed amount per month for each 
</p>
<p>patient in that provider&rsquo;s panel (or at least those covered by the plan), regardless of 
</p>
<p>the amount of services they use or whether a particular patient uses services at all. 
</p>
<p>Under plan capitation, the health plan receives a fixed amount for each patient to 
</p>
<p>cover all the health-care services for all the providers in the plan, essentially an 
</p>
<p>insurance premium. Plan capitation is far more common than provider capitation. 
</p>
<p>Even in capitated managed care plans, including carve-outs to MBHOs, the pre-
</p>
<p>dominant form of reimbursement to providers is fee-for-service or salary (Strunk &amp; 
</p>
<p>Reschovsky, 2002; Zuvekas &amp; Cohen, 2016). This is primarily due to the adminis-
</p>
<p>trative complexity of determining capitation formulas and unwillingness of provid-
</p>
<p>ers, especially in small or solo practices, to assume risk (Berenson &amp; Rich, 2010; 
</p>
<p>Frakt &amp; Mayes, 2012; Goldsmith, 2010; Mechanic &amp; Altman, 2009).
</p>
<p>Medicare&rsquo;s Prospective Payment System, where hospitals receive a fixed pay-
</p>
<p>ment for all patients within a Diagnosis Related Group (DRGs) regardless of the 
</p>
<p>services they use (with provisions for outliers), works in similar fashion to capita-
</p>
<p>tion. Lengths of inpatient hospital stays fell dramatically after Medicare switched to 
</p>
<p>this system in 1983. Many state Medicaid programs and even private health insur-
</p>
<p>ance plans have adopted similar prospective payment systems.

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84
</p>
<p>While there is some evidence that capitation and prospective payment increase 
</p>
<p>efficiency of care, they also create incentives to under-provide care (in contrast to 
</p>
<p>the over-provision of care in fee-for service systems). This is especially true where 
</p>
<p>outcomes are difficult to monitor. Capitation and prospective payment reimburse-
</p>
<p>ment also create strong incentives for the same types of risk selection behavior 
</p>
<p>(cream skimming or cherry picking) evident in health insurance markets. Healthier 
</p>
<p>patients will obviously be more profitable than sicker patients. As a result, the same 
</p>
<p>types of risk-adjustment methods are also commonly applied to capitated and pro-
</p>
<p>spective payments systems, again imperfectly.
</p>
<p>There is increasing recognition that both fee-for-service and capitation are 
</p>
<p>imperfect reimbursement methods if they are not linked explicitly to outcomes and/
</p>
<p>or quality. The term &ldquo;pay for performance&rdquo; has become ubiquitous in recent years 
</p>
<p>to describe various attempts to create better incentives in payment systems. The 
</p>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prefers the terms &ldquo;alternative 
</p>
<p>payment models.&rdquo; Results to date are mixed, but the CMS and private payers con-
</p>
<p>tinue to experiment with wide variety of payment models (Hussey, Ridgely, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Rosenthal, 2011; Rosenthal, Landon, Narmond, et&nbsp;al., 2007; Rosenthal, Frank, Li, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Epstein, 2005; Rosenthal, Landon, Howitt, Song, &amp; Epstein, 2007; Rosenthal, 
</p>
<p>Landrum, Robbins, &amp; Schneider, 2016; Sinaiko et&nbsp;al., 2017). Among the models 
</p>
<p>being tested are various forms of bundled payment linked to clinical outcomes for 
</p>
<p>episodes of treatment (e.g., knee replacement) encompassing most or all compo-
</p>
<p>nents of treatment (hospital, physician, laboratory, rehab) rather than paying indi-
</p>
<p>vidual providers separately.
</p>
<p>Closely related are Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), which combine 
</p>
<p>hospitals, physicians, and other providers to accept bundled payments or to partici-
</p>
<p>pate in other alternative payment models, as well as patient-centered medical homes 
</p>
<p>(PCMHs) (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2018a). These new pay-
</p>
<p>ment models may have accelerated a growing trend of consolidation and integration 
</p>
<p>of health-care providers (e.g., hospitals buying up physician practices). Adoption of 
</p>
<p>these new payment models has been much slower in behavioral health, partly 
</p>
<p>because of concerns about adverse selection and partly because of concerns about 
</p>
<p>measuring behavioral health outcomes.
</p>
<p> Presentation of&nbsp;Critical Issues
</p>
<p>As we have seen, the financing of behavioral health services is closely and increas-
</p>
<p>ingly tied to the health insurance coverage Americans hold (Mark et&nbsp;al., 2016). Loss 
</p>
<p>of health insurance reduces use of behavioral health services, while extending health 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage tends to improves access (Beronio et&nbsp; al., 2014; Frank &amp; 
</p>
<p>McGuire, 1986; Garfield, Zuvekas, Lave, &amp; Donohue, 2011; Zuvekas, 1999). Thus, 
</p>
<p>changes in the health insurance system have immediate consequences for behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health services. We consider here the impact of long-run structural changes in 
</p>
<p>the health insurance system along with two major health reform initiatives of the 
</p>
<p>S. H. Zuvekas</p>

<p>85
</p>
<p>last decade or so: the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the 2008 Mental Health 
</p>
<p>Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA).
</p>
<p> Long-Run Trends in&nbsp;Health Insurance Coverage
</p>
<p>The mixed public and private nature of US health-care systems extends to health 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage. Only those aged 65 and above have near universal coverage 
</p>
<p>through the federally funded Medicare health insurance program. In contrast, 
</p>
<p>working- age Americans and their children still depend primarily on private insur-
</p>
<p>ance obtained through employers or unions to pay for their health care. However, 
</p>
<p>not all Americans have access to employment-related insurance. Some employers 
</p>
<p>do not offer health insurance coverage or offer coverage only to certain types of 
</p>
<p>employees (e.g., full-time but not part-time workers). Some employees decline their 
</p>
<p>employer&rsquo;s offer of insurance either because they are covered by other insurance or 
</p>
<p>cannot or do not wish to pay the employee out-of-pocket share of the insurance 
</p>
<p>premium.
</p>
<p>Prior to the ACA, the percentage of non-elderly Americans who were uninsured 
</p>
<p>remained stable for decades. Approximately 17% of the non-elderly US population 
</p>
<p>was uninsured in both 1997 and 2013 with little variation in between (Fig.&nbsp;1). This 
</p>
<p>stability masks enormous changes. In 1997, 71% of the non-elderly population was 
</p>
<p>covered by private health insurance. By 2013, this had declined a full 10 percentage

</p>
<p>points to 61%. Rising insurance premiums are thought to be a major factor in the 
</p>
<p>decline. For example, the average total cost of an employer-sponsored family plan 
</p>
<p>rose from $4954&nbsp; in 1996 to $16,029&nbsp; in 2013 and to $17,710&nbsp; in 2016 (Fig.&nbsp; 2). 
</p>
<p>Economists generally believe that employees absorb most of these increased insur-
</p>
<p>ance costs in the form of lower wage increases. For example, unions have been 
</p>
<p>willing to make wage concessions in return for continuing guarantees of health 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage in collective bargaining agreements.
</p>
<p>However, as total premiums continue to rise, so too do the amounts employees 
</p>
<p>are required to pay out of pocket for their coverage by employers. The average out- 
</p>
<p>of- pocket share for a single plan was $1325 and $4956 for a family plan in 2016 
</p>
<p>(Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2017, September). This is a likely 
</p>
<p>reason why Americans are increasingly declining employer offers of insurance cov-
</p>
<p>erage (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2017, September; Cooper &amp; 
</p>
<p>Schone, 1997; Cooper &amp; Vistnes, 2003). It is this declining &ldquo;take-up rate&rdquo; that is 
</p>
<p>largely responsible for the decline in private health insurance coverage prior to the 
</p>
<p>ACA.
</p>
<p>Several successive federal and state expansions of Medicaid coverage beginning 
</p>
<p>in the 1990s and the State Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), enacted 
</p>
<p>in 1996 for lower-income uninsured children, have compensated for the loss of pri-
</p>
<p>vate health insurance. The percentage of non-elderly Americans covered by public 
</p>
<p>programs rose substantially from 14% in 1997 to 24% in 2013, fully offsetting the 
</p>
<p>10-percentage point decline in private insurance coverage over that same period 
</p>

<p> Recent Trends Under the&nbsp;Affordable Care Act
</p>
<p>The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislated substantial changes in the structure 
</p>
<p>of health insurance coverage in the United States and led to a decline in the number 
</p>
<p>of uninsured Americans. The most widely known of the ACA&rsquo;s many provisions 
</p>
<p>were three expansions of insurance coverage: (1) dependent coverage to age 25&nbsp;in 
</p>
<p>private plans, (2) ACA marketplace coverage, and (3) Medicaid expansions.
</p>
<p>The first expansion implemented allowed parents to cover any of their children 
</p>
<p>through the age of 25 through their employer&rsquo;s family plan beginning in 2010. This 
</p>
<p>popular provision is especially important for young adults with behavioral health 
</p>
<p>needs. The vast majority of uninsured young adults are healthy. Yet they are also 
</p>
<p>vulnerable as they transition from their parents&rsquo; homes to school (for some) and into 
</p>
<p>the workforce (for others). The onset of many mental disorders, such as schizophre-
</p>
<p>nia and bipolar disorder, tends to occur at precisely this time. Previously, only stu-
</p>
<p>dents up to the age of 22 (or less commonly, age 25) were generally covered, and if 
</p>
<p>the student was forced to drop out of school because of behavioral health issues, 
</p>
<p>they might lose that coverage. The expansion significantly increased coverage in 
</p>
<p>young adults by 5&ndash;8 percentage points (Barbaresco, Courtemanche, &amp; Qi, 2015; 
</p>
<p>McClellan, 2017). 
</p>
<p>Correspondingly, use of mental health but not substance use disorder treatment 
</p>
<p>increased (McClellan, 2017; Saloner &amp; Le Cook, 2014), and out-of-pocket treat-
</p>
<p>ment costs decreased (Ali, Chen, Mutter, Novak, &amp; Mortensen, 2016). However, it 
</p>
<p>is important to note that many young adults do not have access to this type of cover-
</p>
<p>age because their parents do not have private employer-sponsored coverage 
</p>
<p>themselves.
</p>
<p>A second expansion under the ACA established state-based private insurance 
</p>
<p>marketplaces (operated by states alone or in partnership with the federal govern-
</p>
<p>ment) providing new options for individually purchased and small employer plans 
</p>
<p>beginning in 2014. Premiums paid by eligible individuals and families in the mar-
</p>
<p>ketplace are subsidized for those with family incomes between 100 and 400% of the 
</p>
<p>federal poverty line, with larger subsidies for those with lower incomes. These sub-
</p>
<p>sidies are tied to a cap on the percentage of income that a person has to pay for the 
</p>
<p>second lowest cost &ldquo;silver&rdquo; (benchmark) plan offered in the area.
</p>
<p>Silver plans are required to cover a minimum of 70%, on average, of medical 
</p>
<p>costs (bronze plans (60%), gold (80%), platinum (90%)) with the rest paid out-of- 
</p>
<p>pocket by individuals. Individuals and families under 250% of poverty are also eli-
</p>
<p>gible for &ldquo;cost-sharing reduction&rdquo; silver plans, where in addition to premium 
</p>
<p>subsidies they also have more generous coverage with fewer out-of-pocket costs. 
</p>
<p>These subsidies were coupled with a mandate that individuals must be covered by 
</p>
<p>insurance or face a &ldquo;shared responsibility&rdquo; tax penalty.
</p>
<p>This &ldquo;carrot and stick approach&rdquo; of combining subsidies on the one hand with 
</p>
<p>mandates and tax penalties on the other hand was intended to minimize the amount 
</p>
<p>of adverse selection faced by insurers and reduce premium increases. The ACA also 
</p>
<p>contained a number of other provisions to both encourage private insurers and 
</p>
<p>Financing of&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services: Insurance, Managed Care, and&nbsp;Reimbursement</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88
</p>
<p> consumers alike to participate in the marketplaces and to limit adverse selection. 
</p>
<p>Particularly relevant for behavioral health, the ACA mandates that all plans offered 
</p>
<p>in the marketplaces (as well as non-grandfathered individual and small group mar-
</p>
<p>ket plans offered outside of marketplaces) must contain coverage for ten essential 
</p>
<p>health benefits (EHBs). Included among these EHBs are mental health and sub-
</p>
<p>stance use disorder services.
</p>
<p>The third expansion under the ACA gave states generous subsidies to provide 
</p>
<p>Medicaid coverage to individuals with family income up to 138% of the federal 
</p>
<p>poverty level beginning in 2014. Initially, the federal government covered 100% of 
</p>
<p>the cost of newly eligible enrollees falling to 95% in 2017 and 90% in 2020 and 
</p>
<p>beyond (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018c, January 16). The Supreme Court ruled 
</p>
<p>in 2012 that this Medicaid expansion was effectively optional for states, rather than 
</p>
<p>mandatory for continued participation in the overall Medicaid program as originally 
</p>
<p>enacted in the ACA.&nbsp;Subsequently, not all states adopted this expansion (18&nbsp;in all as 
</p>
<p>of January 2018) including large states such as Texas and Florida.
</p>
<p>The ACA led an estimated 20 million previously uninsured Americans to gain 
</p>
<p>coverage (Uberoi et&nbsp;al., 2016). This reduced the share of the uninsured to 11% of the 
</p>
<p>non-elderly population in 2017, down from approximately 17% before the ACA 
</p>
<p>was enacted (Fig.&nbsp;1). Notably, after declining for many years, the share of Americans 
</p>
<p>covered by private insurance coverage stabilized and then increased from 61% in 
</p>
<p>2010 to 65% of the non-elderly in 2017 (Fig.&nbsp;1). This represents the combined effect 
</p>
<p>of the dependent coverage expansions, individual mandates and Marketplace cover-
</p>
<p>age, along with other new mandates and subsidies to employers to provide cover-
</p>
<p>age. Public coverage too continued to increase in importance through the ACA 
</p>
<p>Medicaid expansions (Fig.&nbsp;2).
</p>
<p> Parity
</p>
<p>For decades, coverage for behavioral health services in private health insurance 
</p>
<p>plans lagged behind other services with much higher co-pays and coinsurance (e.g., 
</p>
<p>50% vs 20%) and strict limits on the number of days, visits, or dollars covered in 
</p>
<p>most plans (Barry et&nbsp;al., 2016; Beronio et&nbsp;al., 2014). The main argument advanced 
</p>
<p>in favor of this discriminatory coverage was on economic efficiency grounds, 
</p>
<p>because of the potential for moral hazard the RAND HIE study found. More likely, 
</p>
<p>adverse selection was the driving force with insurers seeking to deter more expen-
</p>
<p>sive consumers with behavioral health problems from enrolling in their plans (Barry 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>Proponents of parity in coverage advanced two main arguments. First, it is dis-
</p>
<p>criminatory to provide less generous coverage to those with behavioral health disor-
</p>
<p>ders, regardless of economic efficiency arguments. Second, parity was affordable in 
</p>
<p>the context of managed care, as a number of studies strongly supported (Barry et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2016; Goldman et&nbsp; al., 2006; National Advisory Mental Health Council, 1998, 
</p>
<p>2000).

<p>89
</p>
<p>Mental health advocates successfully pushed almost every state to enact at least 
</p>
<p>some legislation designed to strengthen mental health coverage in private health 
</p>
<p>plans. However, most of these state mandates fell well short of parity. Even in states 
</p>
<p>with fairly strong parity laws, parity failed to cover most people (Buchmueller, 
</p>
<p>Cooper, Jacobson, &amp; Zuvekas, 2007). Under the provisions of the 1974 Employment 
</p>
<p>Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA), firms that self-insure are exempt 
</p>
<p>from state health insurance regulations including parity mandates. Consequently, 
</p>
<p>strong parity laws covered only 20% of working Americans with health coverage 
</p>
<p>(Buchmueller et&nbsp; al., 2007). In addition, most of these strong laws covered only 
</p>
<p>severe or &ldquo;biologically based&rdquo; disorders and typically did not apply to drug and 
</p>
<p>alcohol services.
</p>
<p>The federal 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) 
</p>
<p>went far beyond these state parity mandates and the earlier 1996 federal law in at 
</p>
<p>least four important ways. First, the MHPAEA eliminated differential co-payments 
</p>
<p>and coinsurance, deductibles, and limits on number of visits and days of treatment 
</p>
<p>for firms that offer behavioral health coverage beginning in 2010&ndash;2011.
</p>
<p>Second, unlike the state mandates, it applies to all employers with 50 or more 
</p>
<p>employees that offer behavioral health coverage. The subsequent 2010 ACA legisla-
</p>
<p>tion further extended parity to all non-grandfathered small group and individual 
</p>
<p>market plans by requiring both that behavioral health services be covered as an EHB 
</p>
<p>and requiring these plans to also meet MHPAEA requirements.
</p>
<p>Third, the MHPAEA is applied not only to services related to mental health con-
</p>
<p>ditions but also drug and alcohol disorders. Fourth, the federal administrative regu-
</p>
<p>lations implementing MHPAEA interpreted parity to apply not only to quantitative 
</p>
<p>plan features like deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums but also to &ldquo;non- 
</p>
<p>quantitative treatment limits&rdquo; (NQTLs) such as medical necessity requirements and 
</p>
<p>prior authorization. For example, if a plan had no prior authorization requirements 
</p>
<p>for office-based visits for a physical condition, the plan could not impose prior 
</p>
<p>authorization requirements for behavioral health visits.
</p>
<p>Congress also extended parity to the Medicare program. HR 6331 gradually 
</p>
<p>reduced cost-sharing for mental health services from 50% to 20% between 2010 
</p>
<p>and 2014.
</p>
<p>Parity does not seem to cost insurers much (Barry et&nbsp;al., 2016; Goldman et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2006), but what does it mean for consumers? The available evidence suggests that 
</p>
<p>parity does indeed reduce the out-of-pocket burden of behavioral health services, 
</p>
<p>albeit modestly (Barry et&nbsp; al., 2016; Ettner et&nbsp; al., 2016; Goldman et&nbsp; al., 2006). 
</p>
<p>Parity&rsquo;s effects on access to behavioral health services are less certain with modest 
</p>
<p>improvements at best (Barry &amp; Busch, 2008; Barry et&nbsp;al., 2016; Busch et&nbsp;al., 2006; 
</p>
<p>Ettner et&nbsp;al., 2016; Goldman et&nbsp;al., 2006; Pacula &amp; Sturm, 2000). The majority of 
</p>
<p>Americans receiving behavioral health services (especially for mental disorders 
</p>
<p>such as depression, anxiety, and ADHD) get the bulk of them through their primary 
</p>
<p>care doctors and/or pharmacies. For all intents and purposes, these services were 
</p>
<p>already largely covered at parity before the MHPAEA and state parity mandates.
</p>
<p>However, in theory all else being equal, parity should have increased access to 
</p>
<p>those needing more intensive, specialty-based behavioral health services. But all 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>90
</p>
<p>else is not equal. Parity creates incentives to tighten other aspects of the manage-
</p>
<p>ment of behavioral health services to offset cost increases in several ways (Barry 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2016; National Advisory Mental Health Council, 1998, 2000; Ridgely, 
</p>
<p>Burnam, Barry, Goldman, &amp; Hennessy, 2006).
</p>
<p>First, NQTLs are by their nature more difficult to monitor and enforce than quan-
</p>
<p>titative limits such as deductible, co-pays, and other cost-sharing features that are 
</p>
<p>written down in policy booklets. Second, plans might use restrictive provider net-
</p>
<p>works to limit access to behavioral health providers. Third, plans can use low reim-
</p>
<p>bursement rates to providers to discourage participation in their plans.
</p>
<p> Significance for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Closer integration with the constantly changing and evolving insurance-based and 
</p>
<p>insurance-financed systems of health care in the United States has profound impli-
</p>
<p>cations for the way behavioral health-care services are financed, organized, and 
</p>
<p>delivered. The costs of providing health care continue to rise increasing pressure for 
</p>
<p>further reforms in health-care systems. The direction these reforms take will have 
</p>
<p>significant impacts on Americans with behavioral health-care needs.
</p>
<p>Less than a decade old, the ACA faces an uncertain future. Providing insurance 
</p>
<p>coverage for millions of American, it significantly reduced the ranks of the unin-
</p>
<p>sured, many with behavioral health needs (Garfield et&nbsp;al., 2011; Mark, Wier, Malone, 
</p>
<p>Penne, &amp; Cowell, 2015). Adults with behavioral health conditions tend to have 
</p>
<p>lower incomes on average and less access to employer-sponsored coverage than 
</p>
<p>other Americans (Garfield et&nbsp;al., 2011). Thus, the ACA Medicaid expansions and 
</p>
<p>substantial premium and cost-sharing reduction subsidies in the marketplaces for 
</p>
<p>lower-income Americans are especially important for them. However, many of the 
</p>
<p>specific provisions of the ACA are unpopular (although some also enjoy fairly wide-
</p>
<p>spread support, such as the dependent coverage expansion) leading to calls for 
</p>
<p>either further reform to ACA provisions at the federal level or outright appeal.
</p>
<p>Short of full repeal, the future of the ACA Medicaid expansions is dependent 
</p>
<p>mainly on the decisions of individual states. As of January 2018, 33 states (includ-
</p>
<p>ing the District of Columbia) have opted to expand Medicaid, with several adopting 
</p>
<p>after the initial 2014 start year (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018, January 16).
</p>
<p>Debate continues in many of the remaining 18 states so more may opt to eventu-
</p>
<p>ally expand. However, there have also been discussions in states that have already 
</p>
<p>expanded about whether to drop the program. Some, like Kentucky, have also 
</p>
<p>sought waivers from the federal government to reduce the scope of the expansion 
</p>
<p>programs offered either in terms of populations served or services offered, including 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has 
</p>
<p>signaled to states that they are interested in giving states more flexibility in the 
</p>
<p>program.
</p>
<p>Changes in how the ACA marketplaces operate may also have disproportionate 
</p>
<p>effects on Americans with behavioral health needs. For example, the 2017 Tax 
</p>
<p>S. H. Zuvekas</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>91
</p>
<p>Reform eliminated the unpopular individual mandate for insurance coverage and 
</p>
<p>shared responsibility tax penalties after 2019. It remains to be seen whether this 
</p>
<p>actually leads to adverse selection, the main conceptual argument for why the man-
</p>
<p>date is necessary, and significantly higher premiums in the marketplaces. It is pos-
</p>
<p>sible that, in practice, this &ldquo;stick&rdquo; side of the equation is less important than subsidies 
</p>
<p>to consumers and insurers in maintaining a stable marketplace.
</p>
<p>Other proposed changes to the marketplaces, besides outright repeal, include 
</p>
<p>eliminating the EHB requirements altogether and thus allowing insurers to sell 
</p>
<p>plans without coverage for behavioral health or other EHB services. These reduced 
</p>
<p>coverage plans would likely be unattractive to consumers with behavioral needs but 
</p>
<p>might be attractive to healthier individuals, potentially leading to adverse selection 
</p>
<p>and higher costs in plans that meet behavioral health needs.
</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (2018c) is already giving states 
</p>
<p>more flexibility in selecting essential health benefit benchmark plans beginning in 
</p>
<p>2020. This might reduce behavioral health coverage and increase the potential for 
</p>
<p>adverse selection if states select less generous plans as their benchmarks for 
</p>
<p>coverage.
</p>
<p>Even without further legislative action, concerns remain that provider networks 
</p>
<p>are more limited and NQTLs greater for behavioral health services in marketplace 
</p>
<p>plans compared to other private coverage (Stewart et&nbsp;al., 2018). In addition, there is 
</p>
<p>concern that the flexibility given to states has led to uneven implementation of par-
</p>
<p>ity requirements in the marketplaces and considerable variation in the scope of men-
</p>
<p>tal health and especially addiction treatment services covered (Berry, Huskamp, 
</p>
<p>Goldman, &amp; Barry, 2015; Tran Smith et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p>Proposed reforms to public insurance and other health programs extend well 
</p>
<p>beyond further ACA reform or outright repeal. As health-care costs continue to rise 
</p>
<p>and the population ages, the Medicare program share of the federal budget contin-
</p>
<p>ues to grow. Many argue this growth is unsustainable in the long run. The ACA itself 
</p>
<p>contained a number of provisions to limit the growth of spending in Medicare, but 
</p>
<p>many of these are unpopular especially with providers and insurers.
</p>
<p>Market-based proposals include turning Medicare into a voucher system. Instead 
</p>
<p>of providing a defined set of benefits universally to all Medicare beneficiaries, indi-
</p>
<p>viduals would receive a fixed dollar amount to purchase private plans. Plans would 
</p>
<p>compete against each other to most efficiently provide coverage to consumers (in 
</p>
<p>many respects, like the ACA marketplace). Instead of an open-ended commitment 
</p>
<p>on the government&rsquo;s part, federal contributions under many of these proposals 
</p>
<p>would be limited to an inflation-indexed voucher value, regardless of how much 
</p>
<p>health-care costs rise. If competition between plans drives substantial innovation 
</p>
<p>leading to better coverage, greater health outcomes, and reduced costs, then con-
</p>
<p>sumers clearly gain. If not, Medicare beneficiaries may see their premiums increase 
</p>
<p>and/or the value of their insurance coverage erode over time. Moreover, there are 
</p>
<p>concerns about how higher-risk consumers, including those with behavioral health 
</p>
<p>needs, would fare in markets where insurers might find them unattractive risks.
</p>
<p>The share of the federal budget devoted to Medicaid also continues to rise. 
</p>
<p>Reform proposals range from giving states more flexibility within the current 
</p>
<p>Financing of&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services: Insurance, Managed Care, and&nbsp;Reimbursement</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92
</p>
<p> program (e.g., changing eligibility requirements, cutting benefits, and/or increasing 
</p>
<p>enrollee cost-sharing) to converting Medicaid to a block grant program. Currently, 
</p>
<p>Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and individual states with 
</p>
<p>the federal government matching state outlays a minimum of 50% but often higher 
</p>
<p>for traditional Medicaid programs and 95% for the Medicaid expansion populations 
</p>
<p>(falling to 90% by 2020).
</p>
<p>Under some block grant proposals, states would receive a fixed per capita alloca-
</p>
<p>tion with constrained growth over time and allowed flexibility to run the Medicaid 
</p>
<p>program as they wish. A per capita allocation would significantly shift resources 
</p>
<p>away from higher spending states, many of whom provide extensive recovery and 
</p>
<p>support services (sometimes termed &ldquo;wrap around services&rdquo;) to those with behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health needs in addition to paying for health-care treatment. These potential 
</p>
<p>reforms in turn are likely to place increasing pressure on public mental health sys-
</p>
<p>tems at a time when those systems are already experiencing financial pressures.
</p>
<p>Calls for reform extend as well to the Veterans Health&nbsp;Administration (VHA) 
</p>
<p>health-care system, a significant provider of behavioral health treatment for millions 
</p>
<p>of veterans (Tsai &amp; Rosenheck, 2016). Proposals range from giving veterans more 
</p>
<p>treatment options outside VA owned and operated facilities to converting the pro-
</p>
<p>gram from a wholly government owned and operated closed system to entirely a 
</p>
<p>private insurance-based system, such as the TRICARE program for spouses and 
</p>
<p>dependents of active duty military personnel.
</p>
<p>Rising health-care costs and premiums continue to threaten the employment- 
</p>
<p>based private health insurance system that provides health insurance coverage to 
</p>
<p>most Americans under the age 65. In spite of its recent stabilization, many predict 
</p>
<p>the employer-based insurance system will continue to slowly erode, increasing the 
</p>
<p>pressure on the ACA marketplaces, state Medicaid budgets, and public mental 
</p>
<p>health and addiction systems.
</p>
<p>Market-based reform efforts to shore up the private health insurance system also 
</p>
<p>have implications for the coverage of behavioral health services. The 2003 Medicare 
</p>
<p>Modernization Act contained provisions to encourage the creation of Health Savings 
</p>
<p>Accounts (HSAs). HSAs allow individuals to pay for health-care services and save 
</p>
<p>for future health expenses tax-free. However, these accounts can only be used by 
</p>
<p>consumers who purchase high-deductible health plans (for individuals, a deductible 
</p>
<p>of at least $1350 and families $2700&nbsp;in 2018). This requirement means that indi-
</p>
<p>viduals and families pay more for health care including behavioral health services 
</p>
<p>directly out of their own pockets. Legislation has also encouraged employers to 
</p>
<p>offer similar types of savings accounts in combination with high-deductible health 
</p>
<p>plan coverage.
</p>
<p>Not all of these high-deductible plans provide behavioral health benefits 
</p>
<p>(Wildsmith, 2009, October). High-deductible plans grew slowly at first but have 
</p>
<p>accelerated in recent years. In 2016, 85% of all employer provided coverage con-
</p>
<p>tained a deductible with an average individual deductible of $1696 and an average 
</p>
<p>family deductible of $3069 (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2017, 
</p>
<p>September).

</p>
<p>Other proposed market-based reforms would supplant the employment-based 
</p>
<p>system altogether with vouchers or tax credits for the purchase of individual health 
</p>
<p>insurance plans. Lacking the pooling mechanism of a large employer, there are con-
</p>
<p>cerns that adverse selection would lead to problems accessing affordable and ade-
</p>
<p>quate insurance coverage for those with behavioral health needs if these individual 
</p>
<p>markets are not well-designed.
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>The share of the nation&rsquo;s resources devoted to behavioral services, as measured by 
</p>
<p>gross domestic product (GDP), has remained largely level since the 1970s (Frank &amp; 
</p>
<p>Glied, 2006; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016). 
</p>
<p>This stands in marked contrast with the health-care system as a whole, which has 
</p>
<p>grown from 7% to 18% of GDP since 1970 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
</p>
<p>Services, 2018, January 8). In one sense, this represents a phenomenal success 
</p>
<p>(Druss, 2006; Frank &amp; Glied, 2006). The continued movement away from hospitals 
</p>
<p>to community settings has allowed millions more Americans to be drawn into 
</p>
<p>behavioral health treatment, without increasing the share of the country&rsquo;s resources 
</p>
<p>needed to finance these services.
</p>
<p>However, the shift to insurance-financed treatment systems has also led to a rela-
</p>
<p>tive shift in resources away from individuals with severe and persistent mental ill-
</p>
<p>ness and addiction toward those with other mental disorders such as anxiety, 
</p>
<p>depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment has 
</p>
<p>undoubtedly improved for most people with serious and persistent mental illness 
</p>
<p>(SPMI), but the still fragmentary nature of financing creates substantial gaps, espe-
</p>

<p>The Role of&nbsp;Implementation Science 
in&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Oliver&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Massey and&nbsp;Enya&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Vroom
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Health and behavioral health professionals recognize a critical research-to-practice 
</p>
<p>gap in the provision of community-based services. This gap lies between what is 
</p>
<p>known about effective services developed through careful research and what is typi-
</p>
<p>cally provided in community-based behavioral health services. Effective services, 
</p>
<p>practices, and programs, defined as evidence-based programs (EBPs), have demon-
</p>
<p>strated evidence of their effectiveness under controlled research settings. EBPs were 
</p>
<p>developed with the expectations that professionals would readily adopt services of 
</p>
<p>proven efficacy to improve the quality of outcomes for service recipients. It was 
</p>
<p>believed good programs would easily find a home in service agencies that are genu-
</p>
<p>inely interested in using the best interventions for their clients.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is now recognized that programs are not adopted readily and 
</p>
<p>there are significant gaps in the translation of EBPs into working programs in the 
</p>
<p>field (Proctor et&nbsp;al., 2009; Urban &amp; Trochim, 2009). Simply providing an effective 
</p>
<p>new program is not sufficient to ensure that it is implemented in the real world.
</p>
<p>This inability to translate effective programs into practices in the field has led to 
</p>
<p>an emphasis on implementation science (IS). IS attempts to bridge the gap between 
</p>
<p>research and practice by identifying and accounting for the barriers that prevent 
</p>
<p>effective programs from being easily identified, accepted, and utilized in clinical 
</p>
<p>practice. Known as tracing blue highways, a two-way adaptation, research-practice 
</p>
<p>integration, and research translation (Fixsen, Naoom, Blase, Friedman, &amp; Wallace, 
</p>
<p>2005; Hoagwood &amp; Johnson, 2003; Urban &amp; Trochim, 2009; Wandersman et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2008; Westfall, Mold, &amp; Fagnan, 2007), IS deals with the capacity to move what is 
</p>
<p>known about effective treatment into services (Proctor et&nbsp;al., 2009).

</p>
<p>IS encompasses the investigation of methods, variables, interventions, and strate-
</p>
<p>gies to promote appropriate adoption, support, and sustainability of EBPs (Titler, 
</p>
<p>Everett, &amp; Adams, 2007). This perspective recognizes the complex problem of 
</p>
<p>ensuring that an effective intervention is adapted and integrated into practice where 
</p>
<p>community acceptability, applicability, organizational and political demands, 
</p>
<p>resources, and cultural differences may compromise program effectiveness and 
</p>
<p>consumer outcomes.
</p>
<p>This chapter reviews and discusses research and practice in the fields of behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health and public health from the perspective of IS, with an emphasis on criti-
</p>
<p>cal questions researchers and practice professionals must address as they attempt to 
</p>
<p>improve services in the community. While a complete discussion of the research-to- 
</p>
<p>practice gap might include the early stages involved with converting basic science 
</p>
<p>findings into human applications and interventions (often labeled translational sci-
</p>
<p>ence), this chapter concentrates on latter stages concerned with moving programs 
</p>
<p>that have been conceptualized and tested under controlled conditions into clinical 
</p>
<p>practices. We are concerned with the issues that help in moving programs of proven 
</p>
<p>efficacy into programs of ongoing effectiveness in the field. We pay particular atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the process of implementation, issues in program fidelity, fit, and adaptation 
</p>
<p>and conclude with a discussion of integration and sustainability.
</p>
<p> Evidence-Based Programs
</p>
<p>As we are concerned with the implementation of evidence-based programs and 
</p>
<p>practices (EBPs), it may be helpful to clarify how we define EBPs. The term 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;evidence- based practice&rdquo; has a number of definitions. One definition revolves 
</p>
<p>around evidence-based treatments, practices, and interventions and those related 
</p>
<p>sets of programs or policies that have empirical proof of their effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>Empirical proof, by definition, is based in a demonstration of therapeutic change, an 
</p>
<p>outcome that is different from a no-treatment or treatment as usual condition 
</p>
<p>(Kazdin, 2008), and focuses on approaches shown to be effective through research 
</p>
<p>rather than through professional experience or opinion (Guevara &amp; Solomon, 2009).
</p>
<p>A second definition of EBPs addresses the practice of clinical service that is 
</p>
<p>based on an evidence-informed philosophy in which services for consumers should 
</p>
<p>emerge from careful consideration of the professional&rsquo;s clinical expertise and accu-
</p>
<p>mulated experience, available research evidence, and the wishes, needs, and prefer-
</p>
<p>ences of the patient. An EBP then becomes one that integrates these perspectives in 
</p>
<p>the process of making decisions about patient care. Research evidence is just one 
</p>
<p>source of information that helps support an effective patient care process. This 
</p>
<p>broader term is often used by health disciplines including medicine, public health, 
</p>
<p>and psychology (APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice, 2006; 
</p>
<p>Hoagwood &amp; Johnson, 2003; Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes, &amp; Richardson, 
</p>
<p>1996) and is a source of confusion among professionals and laypersons alike. Our 
</p>
<p>use of the term EBP aligns with the first definition, as in those practices, programs, 
</p>

</p>
<p>or interventions shown to be empirically efficacious under controlled research 
</p>
<p>situations.
</p>
<p>The emphasis on the use of EBPs has significantly increased in the last three 
</p>
<p>decades. In 1999, the US Surgeon General reported that despite the widespread 
</p>
<p>availability of EBPs, persons with mental illnesses were not actually receiving them 
</p>
<p>(Office of the Surgeon General, 1999).
</p>
<p>Of the many programs and services that were in use, only a relatively small num-
</p>
<p>ber had evidence of their effectiveness (Kazdin, 2000). This led to the President&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003), which suggested all clinical 
</p>
<p>practice should have a foundation in evidence in order to increase the effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of mental health services. From this emphasis, IS emerged as a key component in 
</p>
<p>the improvement of clinical services.
</p>
<p> Barriers to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Use of&nbsp;EBPs
</p>
<p>As EBPs are widely available, any discussion of IS must begin with why programs 
</p>
<p>of proven efficacy are not used. The difficulty inherent in the translation of pro-
</p>
<p>grams into the community does not lie with the lack of effectiveness studies or suf-
</p>
<p>ficient evidence to convince skeptics of a program&rsquo;s utility or value. A large number 
</p>
<p>of evidence-based programs and interventions are available for many behavioral 
</p>
<p>health concerns. Rather, the difficulties rest with the EBP and its fit with a range of 
</p>
<p>issues germane to the service organization and professionals providing services. 
</p>
<p>These include staffing, clientele, political climate, funding limitations, and cultural 
</p>
<p>expectations at both the organizational and community levels (Aarons, 2004, 2006; 
</p>
<p>Green, 2008; Lehman, Greener, &amp; Simpson, 2002).
</p>
<p>A number of implementation models suggest six sets of factors are relevant for 
</p>
<p>program implementation success (Chaudoir, Dugan, &amp; Barr, 2013; Damschroder 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2009; Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008; Nilsen, 2015). These factors include (1) char-
</p>
<p>acteristics of the EBP itself, (2) characteristics of the professionals providing ser-
</p>
<p>vices, (3) consumer/patient and stakeholder variables, (4) the context and culture of 
</p>
<p>the organization providing services, (5) the community, and (6) the strategies used 
</p>
<p>to facilitate or implement the EBP (see Table&nbsp;1).
</p>
<p>Characteristics of the EBP relevant for successful implementation may include 
</p>
<p>the source of the intervention the strength of the evidence supporting its use, the 
</p>
<p>advantage of its use, and issues of cost, complexity, adaptability, and &ldquo;trialability&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Damschroder et&nbsp;al., 2009). A program or practice that can be used on a trial basis, 
</p>
<p>adapted to fit the needs or qualifications of current staff, and costs little to imple-
</p>
<p>ment is more likely to be adopted than one that does not. The presence of a standard 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;manualized&rdquo; approach is also an important characteristic of the EBP (Stichter, 
</p>
<p>Herzog, Owens, &amp; Malugen, 2016).
</p>
<p>Characteristics of the professionals providing services also play a critical role in 
</p>
<p>the successful adoption of new or different services. A fundamental concern for 
</p>
<p>staff is if they have the qualifications and skills to provide the new service and, if 
</p>

</p>
<p>not, is training available and readily obtained. The National Implementation 
</p>
<p>Research Network (NIRN) model of implementation suggests the selection, train-
</p>
<p>ing, and coaching of professional staff are critical drivers of successful implementa-
</p>
<p>tion (Fixsen et&nbsp;al., 2005). Even with the requisite skills, staff readiness for change 
</p>
<p>and willingness to try a new program may determine if it is implemented success-
</p>
<p>fully (Aarons, 2004). Finally, staff attitudes toward the new effort, their faith in its 
</p>
<p>value, and their trust that the program will be supported all bear on eventual imple-
</p>
<p>mentation success (Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008).
</p>
<p>Characteristics of the clientele receiving services include considerations of those 
</p>
<p>who will eventually receive the service or program. Even the most effective pro-
</p>
<p>gram will not succeed if it confronts the culture, faith, or beliefs of the consumers 
</p>
<p>for whom it is intended (Feldstein &amp; Glasgow, 2008). Patient values and preferences 
</p>
<p>will determine if they are willing to participate in interventions proposed on their 
</p>
<p>behalf. Culture may trump evidence in the ultimate test of successful implementa-
</p>
<p>tion. Those belonging to cultures who have suffered historic disparities may not 
</p>
<p>trust the program or its purveyors and may refuse to engage in services they did not 
</p>
<p>have a say in developing (Dovidio et&nbsp;al., 2008).
</p>
<p>Characteristics of the organization providing services such as organizational 
</p>
<p>type, leadership styles, organizational climate, and the management processes that 
</p>
<p>support the program or practice all contribute to implementation success (Aarons &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sommerfeld, 2012; Aarons, Sommerfeld, &amp; Walrath-Greene, 2009; Durlak &amp; 
</p>
<p>DuPre, 2008). An adaptive leadership style has been proposed as increasing suc-
</p>
<p>cessful program implementation and having appropriate decision support systems, 
</p>
<p>middle management support, and administrative supports (Fixsen et&nbsp; al., 2005; 
</p>
<p>Tabrizi, 2014).
</p>
<p>Another major consideration is the importance of change agents or program 
</p>
<p>champions who may be engaged in the implementation process (Greenhalgh, 
</p>
<p>Robert, Macfarlane, Bate, &amp; Kyriakidou, 2004; Rogers, 2003). These individuals

</p>
<p>believe in the purpose and mission of the EBP that their organization is implement-
</p>
<p>ing and can assist in creating the organizational culture and climate conducive to 
</p>
<p>accepting innovation. Finally, adequate staffing patterns and supervision may also 
</p>
<p>impact the successful implementation of new services (Walker et&nbsp;al., 2003), as can 
</p>
<p>larger issues of organizational structure such as identifying lines of authority and 
</p>
<p>accountability (Massey, Armstrong, Boroughs, Henson, &amp; McCash, 2005).
</p>
<p>Organizations are embedded in broader communities that influence the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of new programs and practices. Thus, characteristics of the community 
</p>
<p>also influence successful implementation. Public policies; local, state, and federal 
</p>
<p>laws and regulations; political climate; and realities of funding may all contribute to 
</p>
<p>the utilization of new programs and services (Chaudoir et&nbsp; al., 2013; Durlak &amp; 
</p>
<p>DuPre, 2008). Legal, political, and human capital are often required to ensure suc-
</p>
<p>cessful implementation, and each EBP brings its own set of political, regulatory, and 
</p>
<p>leadership issues (Isett et&nbsp;al., 2007). Damschroder et&nbsp;al. (2009) include communica-
</p>
<p>tion and social network channels and the resulting community culture that encour-
</p>
<p>ages or discourages adoption of new programs and policies.
</p>
<p>Lastly, characteristics of the implementation process itself may influence the 
</p>
<p>eventual success of a new program or practice. Damschroder et&nbsp;al. (2009) suggest at 
</p>
<p>least four considerations in how programs are implemented including the process of 
</p>
<p>planning, engaging, executing, and evaluating programs as they are implemented. 
</p>
<p>Blase, Kiser, and Van Dyke (2013) suggest successful implementation requires con-
</p>
<p>sideration of resources, capacity, readiness, and fit as part of the planning and 
</p>
<p>engaging process. As will be discussed later, implementation occurs in stages, with 
</p>
<p>different considerations emerging over time. Much research remains regarding how 
</p>
<p>to move programs optimally into practice. Crucial questions also remain regarding 
</p>
<p>how much each of these domains weighs in the implementation of new programs 
</p>
<p>and where scarce resources should be placed to maximally encourage successful 
</p>
<p>program innovation.
</p>
<p> Fidelity and&nbsp;Adaptation of&nbsp;EBPs
</p>
<p>Given the many barriers to successful implementation, an overarching concern is 
</p>
<p>what must be done to address these challenges to ensure that programs are imple-
</p>
<p>mented successfully. Successful program implementation demands a balance 
</p>
<p>between maintaining the fidelity of the program and allowing program adaptations 
</p>
<p>that are required to overcome any barriers to its successful use. The challenge is to 
</p>
<p>resolve the tension between fidelity and fit. This tension deals with the match 
</p>
<p>between programs as developed and the needs, interests, and concerns of popula-
</p>
<p>tions in the community and may include the degree to which efforts account for 
</p>
<p>cultural, community, and family standards and expectations (Lieberman et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2011).
</p>
<p>Fidelity has been variously labeled as integrity, implementation fidelity, and 
</p>
<p>treatment fidelity (Allen, Shelton, Emmons, &amp; Linnan, 2018; Carroll et&nbsp;al., 2007; 
</p>

</p>
<p>Dane &amp; Schneider, 1998) and defined as the extent to which a program or innova-
</p>
<p>tion is implemented as it was originally designed or intended (Allen et&nbsp;al., 2018; 
</p>
<p>Carroll et&nbsp;al., 2007; Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008). It involves attention to measuring and 
</p>
<p>maintaining the elements of a program or practice that are critical for programmatic 
</p>
<p>impact as the program is brought into the community setting (Bond, Evans, Salyers, 
</p>
<p>Williams, &amp; Kim, 2000; Bruns, 2008; Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 
</p>
<p>2007).
</p>
<p>The conceptualization and operationalization of fidelity has evolved to include 
</p>
<p>five core elements: (1) adherence, (2) dose or exposure, (3) quality of delivery, (4) 
</p>
<p>participant responsiveness, and (5) program differentiation (Allen et&nbsp; al., 2018; 
</p>
<p>Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008) (see Table&nbsp;2).
</p>
<p>Adherence refers to the degree to which a program or practice was implemented 
</p>
<p>consistent with the structure, components, and procedures under which it was 
</p>
<p>designed (Carroll et&nbsp;al., 2007). For example, if a substance abuse prevention pro-
</p>
<p>gram delivered in a classroom setting required the teacher to implement the curricu-
</p>
<p>lum based on a weekly schedule utilizing an adult learning model, utilizing a 
</p>
<p>biweekly schedule without the adult learning model would reflect poor program 
</p>
<p>adherence.
</p>
<p>Dose or exposure refers to the degree to which the amount of a program partici-
</p>
<p>pants receive matches the program model as designed (Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008). 
</p>
<p>While dose in medical terminology is readily defined, in behavioral health settings, 
</p>
<p>dose may correspond to appropriate exposure to program elements, the duration of 
</p>
<p>the program as it was originally prescribed, or even the number of therapeutic ses-
</p>
<p>sions attended (Baldwin, Johnson, &amp; Benally, 2009). In an evaluation of a school- 
</p>
<p>based intervention program, Yampolskaya, Massey, and Greenbaum (2006) 
</p>
<p>measured dose as time spent in hours in academic and behavioral programming.
</p>
<p>Quality of delivery is the manner in which the implementer (e.g., teacher, clini-
</p>
<p>cian, or staff) delivers a program or practice (Allen et&nbsp;al., 2018). This can include 
</p>
<p>how well an implementer answers questions or addresses concerns and how knowl-
</p>
<p>edgeable they are of the program model and curriculum. Often, observation and a 
</p>
<p>trained rater or observer measure this element based on components included in a 
</p>

</p>
<p>fidelity measure or checklist. For example, raters observing a classroom-based sub-
</p>
<p>stance abuse prevention program may be interested in observing and rating a teach-
</p>
<p>er&rsquo;s clarity of instruction on how to complete a marijuana myth-busting 
</p>
<p>assignment.
</p>
<p>Participant responsiveness refers to how engaged and responsive a participant is 
</p>
<p>to a program or practice as well as their level of understanding of program materials 
</p>
<p>or the importance of a practice (e.g., deep breathing or adherence to medication) 
</p>
<p>(Allen et&nbsp;al., 2018; Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008). Although much emphasis has been put 
</p>
<p>on the examination of adherence and dosage, achieving high levels of adherence can 
</p>
<p>be influenced by other elements like participant responsiveness (Carroll et&nbsp;al., 2007) 
</p>
<p>and may not always be the most significant predictor of participant outcomes.
</p>
<p>Program differentiation refers to components that have been identified as unique 
</p>
<p>to a program, without which, programmatic success would be impossible (Allen 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2018). The identification of the critical common elements of a program or 
</p>
<p>intervention constitutes and defines the program (Chorpita, Daleiden, &amp; Weisz, 
</p>
<p>2005). Program differentiation may also be important for evaluations of new inter-
</p>
<p>ventions in order to identify components of the program that are essential for posi-
</p>
<p>tive outcomes (Carroll et&nbsp;al., 2007). While some researchers suggest that all core 
</p>
<p>elements of fidelity are equally important, others argue those implementing need to 
</p>
<p>prioritize the elements based on the intervention, its purpose, and the resources and 
</p>
<p>personnel that are available (Allen et&nbsp;al., 2018; Harn, Parisi, &amp; Stoolmiller, 2013).
</p>
<p> Fidelity and&nbsp;Outcomes
</p>
<p>There is significant evidence supporting the relationship between fidelity and par-
</p>
<p>ticipant outcomes (c.f. Carroll et&nbsp;al., 2007; Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008), and a thorough 
</p>
<p>evaluation of fidelity is integral to understanding why an intervention succeeds or 
</p>
<p>fails. If fidelity is not monitored and evaluated, it may not be possible to determine 
</p>
<p>if the failure of an intervention is related to poor implementation, the shortcomings 
</p>
<p>of the intervention itself (labeled as a &ldquo;type III error&rdquo;), or other ancillary variables 
</p>
<p>(Allen et&nbsp;al., 2018; Carroll et&nbsp;al., 2007; Harn et&nbsp;al., 2013). The emphasis in fidelity 
</p>
<p>has resulted in numerous attempts to identify critical elements and standards of 
</p>
<p>programs and to conduct fidelity assessments to measure the degree to which pro-
</p>
<p>grams maintain these standards (c.f. Desch&ecirc;nes, Clark, &amp; Herrygers, 2008; 
</p>
<p>Hernandez, Worthington, &amp; Davis, 2005). For example, Pullmann, Bruns, and 
</p>
<p>Sather (2013) developed a fidelity index that assessed the degree to which providers 
</p>
<p>followed the essential principles of wraparound in their service delivery. The index 
</p>
<p>assesses the degree to which critical components of wraparound such as family 
</p>
<p>participation, strength-based approaches, and cultural competence are present in 
</p>
<p>therapeutic encounters. Thus, fidelity has become the cornerstone of effective 
</p>
<p>implementation (Lendrum, Humphrey, &amp; Greenberg, 2016).
</p>
<p>Balanced against the concern for program fidelity is the need for EBPs to fit the 
</p>
<p>communities where they are implemented. This contrasting perspective may be 
</p>

<p>108
</p>
<p>characterized as the relevance of the program for the community and the realities of 
</p>
<p>not only resources and capacity but also characterized by culture, family and com-
</p>
<p>munity preferences, and acceptance by professionals who recognize the unique 
</p>
<p>characteristics and needs of their consumers. Not all EBPs are necessarily devel-
</p>
<p>oped for members of specific communities or all proven interventions appropriate 
</p>
<p>for all communities in need of services. In efforts to ensure the internal validity of 
</p>
<p>research studies, interventions are developed and tested on narrowly defined, homo-
</p>
<p>geneous populations.
</p>
<p>The emphasis on internal validity, a critical concern for the development of 
</p>
<p>evidence- based research, comes at the expense of external validity and the effective-
</p>
<p>ness of interventions across populations (Green, 2008; Green &amp; Glasgow, 2006; 
</p>
<p>Hoagwood, Burns, Kiser, Ringeisen, &amp; Schoenwald, 2001). Thus, one difficulty 
</p>
<p>rests with establishing a match between the program developed for a narrow, spe-
</p>
<p>cifically defined clientele and the diverse clientele residing in the community. A 
</p>
<p>second difficulty rests with the match between the EBPs&rsquo; programmatic require-
</p>
<p>ments and the needs, capacity, and constraints operating in community service 
</p>
<p>agencies. Community organizations may simply not have the resources to provide 
</p>
<p>an EBP under the same conditions or at the same level of intensity as the program 
</p>
<p>was developed. Adaptations are then necessary in order to provide an intervention 
</p>
<p>that is effective at the local level (Castro, Barrera Jr, &amp; Martinez Jr, 2004; Harn 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p>Adaptations can be defined as modifications or changes made to an EBP in order 
</p>
<p>to serve the needs of a particular setting or to increase the fit of a program to a target 
</p>
<p>population. Adaptations typically take place during the adaption and implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of the intervention. They improve a program&rsquo;s fit and compatibility with a new 
</p>
<p>setting and the needs of the individual(s) and population(s) of interest (Carvalho 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2013; Rabin &amp; Brownson, 2018; Stirman, Miller, Toder, &amp; Calloway, 2013). 
</p>
<p>Client and provider attributes (e.g., language, cultural norms, understanding of the 
</p>
<p>EBP) may also be taken into consideration to enhance the fit between the EBP and 
</p>
<p>consumers (Cabassa &amp; Baumann, 2013).
</p>
<p>For example, a study in Zambia looked to adapt adult trauma-focused cognitive 
</p>
<p>behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for use with children and adolescents. Murray et&nbsp;al. 
</p>
<p>(2013) discovered it was critical to work collaboratively with local stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>counselors in order to create culturally responsive and high-fidelity adaptations to 
</p>
<p>increase &ldquo;fit&rdquo; and acceptability of the intervention. The collaborative process by 
</p>
<p>which TF-CBT was selected and adapted assisted in creating strong buy-in from the 
</p>
<p>local community, including the support and recommendation of the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Health in Zambia (Murray et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p>Tension exists in the research community over the competing ideas of fidelity 
</p>
<p>versus adaptation (Castro et&nbsp;al., 2004; Morrison et&nbsp;al., 2009). While some argue 
</p>
<p>adaptations are essential in order to meet the needs of a particular setting, others 
</p>
<p>argue a program that has been adapted will be significantly less effective when com-
</p>
<p>pared to the original program (Carvalho et&nbsp;al., 2013; Castro et&nbsp;al., 2004; Chambers 
</p>
<p>&amp; Norton, 2016). This distinction rests with the emphasis on ensuring the effective-
</p>
<p>ness of an intervention under clearly specified conditions versus the emphasis on

</p>
<p>generalizability and effectiveness in less consistent, real-world settings. While 
</p>
<p>adaptations may threaten internal validity, the intent is to improve external validity 
</p>
<p>and thus enhance outcomes for program participants in the real world (Baumann, 
</p>
<p>Cabassa, &amp; Stirman, 2018).
</p>
<p>To address the issues associated with adaptations and fidelity, it is important for 
</p>
<p>consumers (e.g., schools, clinicians, mental health organizations) to identify the 
</p>
<p>core components or &ldquo;active ingredients&rdquo; (Chorpita et&nbsp;al., 2005; Harn et&nbsp;al., 2013) of 
</p>
<p>a program or practice in order to preserve them during the adaptation process. Once 
</p>
<p>these core components are defined, frameworks, such as the Interactive Systems 
</p>
<p>Framework (Wandersman et&nbsp;al., 2008), the Modification Framework (Stirman et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2013), or the Adaptome data platform (Chambers &amp; Norton, 2016), can assist in 
</p>
<p>monitoring adaptations to ensure critical components are left unchanged. If signifi-
</p>
<p>cant program modification does occur, then it is incumbent on implementers to con-
</p>
<p>duct rigorous outcome evaluations in order to assess the possible impact the changes 
</p>
<p>may have on intended outcomes (Carvalho et&nbsp;al., 2013) (for a more comprehensive 
</p>
<p>discussion of managing adaptations and fidelity, c.f. Cabassa &amp; Baumann, 2013; 
</p>
<p>Castro et&nbsp;al., 2004; Chambers &amp; Norton, 2016; Lee, Altschul, &amp; Mowbray, 2008; 
</p>
<p>Stirman et&nbsp;al., 2013; Wandersman et&nbsp;al., 2008).
</p>
<p>The question remains as to whether a program reaching optimal fidelity would be 
</p>
<p>sufficient to obtain significant outcomes (Chambers &amp; Norton, 2016). More research 
</p>
<p>is needed to identify the appropriate balance between fidelity and adaptation.
</p>
<p> Stages of&nbsp;Implementation
</p>
<p>Given the tension between program fidelity and community fit, a natural question is 
</p>
<p>how the implementation process might work. In human service settings, practitio-
</p>
<p>ners usually serve to enable a new intervention. As a result, innovations have to be 
</p>
<p>built into thousands of practitioners in multiple organizations that operate under 
</p>
<p>different regulations (e.g., state and federal) and contexts (Fixsen, Blase, Naoom, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Wallace, 2009). It has been suggested the ultimate success of a program and its 
</p>
<p>sustainability (described below) will be largely dependent on laying an appropriate 
</p>
<p>foundation for change (Adelman &amp; Taylor, 2003).
</p>
<p>To assist in building innovations into community settings, researchers have pro-
</p>
<p>posed several models of implementation that emphasize the implementation process 
</p>
<p>as occurring in stages (Aarons, Hurlburt, &amp; Horwitz, 2011; Fixsen et&nbsp; al., 2005, 
</p>
<p>2009). The EPIS (exploration, adoption/preparation, implementation, sustainment) 
</p>
<p>is an example of a four-stage model which has different stages that span outer (e.g., 
</p>
<p>sociopolitical) and inner (e.g., organization characteristics) contexts (Aarons et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2011). To provide a concrete example of implementation stages, we review another 
</p>
<p>four-stage model, the National Implementation Research Network&rsquo;s (NIRN) model, 
</p>
<p>that includes exploration, installation, initial implementation, and full implementa-
</p>
<p>tion (Fixsen et&nbsp;al., 2005; National Implementation Research Network, 2015).

</p>
<p> The National Implementation Research Network (NIRN) Model
</p>
<p>The first stage in the NIRN model is exploration. Exploration begins when an orga-
</p>
<p>nization, community, or an individual within an organization/community decides to 
</p>
<p>make use of a new program or practice. The purpose of this stage is to explore the 
</p>
<p>potential fit between the community and the EBP, the needs of the community, the 
</p>
<p>needs of the EBP, and the amount of community resources needed and available in 
</p>
<p>order to implement the new program. The stage helps determine whether the orga-
</p>
<p>nization should proceed with the innovation or not. A critical question in this stage 
</p>
<p>is the degree of an organization&rsquo;s readiness for implementation. Research has shown 
</p>
<p>that taking time for exploration and planning saves time and money and can increase 
</p>
<p>the likelihood of success (Fixsen et&nbsp;al., 2005; National Implementation Research 
</p>
<p>Network, 2015; Saldana, Chamberlain, Wang, &amp; Hendricks Brown, 2012).
</p>
<p>The second stage of implementation in the NIRN model is installation. During 
</p>
<p>installation, the resources and structural supports needed to assist the implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of an EBP are procured. Resources can include selecting staff, finding sources 
</p>
<p>for training and coaching and providing the initial training for staff, ensuring loca-
</p>
<p>tion/space (e.g., classroom or office space) and access to materials or equipment 
</p>
<p>(e.g., computer or projector), finding or developing fidelity tools, and identifying 
</p>
<p>funding streams and human resource strategies. This is the stage where a commu-
</p>
<p>nity or organization prepares their staff for the new innovation During  (Fixsen 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2005; National Implementation Research Network 2015).
</p>
<p>The third stage is initial implementation. This stage involves using the new EBP 
</p>
<p>for the first time. Often referred to as the &ldquo;initial awkward stage&rdquo; of implementation, 
</p>
<p>this is where practitioners become familiar with the new program or practice (Fixsen 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2005). It also happens to be the most delicate stage of implementation, because 
</p>
<p>organizations and practitioners are changing their normal, comfortable routines and 
</p>
<p>have to fight the urge of reverting to old routines. In order to sustain these changes 
</p>
<p>in a practitioner&rsquo;s routine, it is essential to establish external supports (e.g., coaches, 
</p>
<p>implementation teams, or leadership) on the practice, organization, and system lev-
</p>
<p>els (National Implementation Research Network 2015).
</p>
<p>The final stage in the NIRN model is full implementation. Full implementation is 
</p>
<p>achieved when the new ways of providing services have become standard practice 
</p>
<p>with practitioners, staff, and organizational leaders. Concomitant changes in poli-
</p>
<p>cies and procedures also are standardized. At this point, the anticipated benefits of 
</p>
<p>an EBP are realized, with staff and practitioners skilled in the procedures of their 
</p>
<p>new routine. Achieving and sustaining full implementation is an arduous process 
</p>
<p>and may be enabled by the success of the preceding stages (National Implementation 
</p>
<p>Research Network 2015). However, research has shown that success in early stages 
</p>
<p>of implementation may not always guarantee full implementation (Abdinnour- 
</p>
<p>Helm, Lengnick-Hall, &amp; Lengnick-Hall, 2003).
</p>
<p>One of the main benefits from adhering to a theoretical model or conceptual 
</p>
<p>framework is it allows consumers and researchers to plan for potential barriers and 
</p>
<p>recognize the facilitators of implementation before resources and time are depleted.

</p>
<p>More examples and information on other models of implementation are found else-
</p>
<p>where (c.f. Aarons et&nbsp;al., 2011; Damschroder et&nbsp;al., 2009; Rogers, 2003; Saldana, 
</p>
<p>2014; Saldana et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p> Sustainability of&nbsp;EBPs
</p>
<p>Once a program is in place, the question becomes how to sustain it. Sustainability is 
</p>
<p>involved with the continuity and maintenance of programs after implementation and 
</p>
<p>must be a major consideration of IS.&nbsp; Sustainability may be broadly defined to 
</p>
<p>encompass several aspects of the continuity of an EBP, including maintenance of 
</p>
<p>the procedural processes, commitments, financing (Fixsen et&nbsp;al., 2005), obtaining 
</p>
<p>resources, gaining visibility, status and organizational place (Massey et&nbsp;al., 2005), 
</p>
<p>and supporting the continued benefits and positive outcomes of the program effort 
</p>
<p>(Moore, Mascarenhas, Bain, &amp; Straus, 2017). Sustainability may be best thought of 
</p>
<p>as a continuation of the implementation process, where the emphasis shifts from 
</p>
<p>putting a program into place to maintaining the program through ongoing adapta-
</p>
<p>tion and continuous quality improvement efforts (Chambers, Glasgow, &amp; Stange, 
</p>
<p>2013).
</p>
<p>While there have been major advances in understanding the adoption, integra-
</p>
<p>tion, and implementation of EBPs, program sustainability is not always adequately 
</p>
<p>considered (Shelton, Cooper, &amp; Stirman, 2018). This lack of attention can not only 
</p>
<p>lead to economic and resource losses from wasted effort but also limits the likeli-
</p>
<p>hood of successful improvements. EBPs that are discontinued or deserted can result 
</p>
<p>in lower levels of buy-in when a new EBP is proposed for an organization/commu-
</p>
<p>nity and limit the trust that individuals place in research and organizations that con-
</p>
<p>duct research (Shelton et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>A number of challenges exist to the sustainability of even well-implemented 
</p>
<p>programs. For example, a systematic review examining the sustainability of health 
</p>
<p>interventions implemented in sub-Saharan Africa found that weak health systems, 
</p>
<p>lack of financial leadership, lack of a consistent workforce, and social and political 
</p>
<p>climates limited an organization&rsquo;s ability to build capacity and sustain interventions 
</p>
<p>(Iwelunmor et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>Those who implement EBPs frequently fail to consider the ongoing changes that 
</p>
<p>happen within communities and organizations (Chambers et&nbsp;al., 2013). Prevention 
</p>
<p>programs implemented within a community or organization evolve over time due to 
</p>
<p>changes and level of understanding of staff (i.e., buy-in), feedback from the com-
</p>
<p>munity or organization, and improvement in the quality of delivery (Shelton et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2018). Consistent with the implementation process, research suggests, among other 
</p>
<p>factors, successful sustainability requires modifiable programs, internal champions, 
</p>
<p>readily perceived benefits, and adequate funding and infrastructure support (Hunter, 
</p>
<p>Han, Slaughter, Godley, &amp; Garner, 2017; Scheirer, 2005). It is also critical to ensure 
</p>
<p>all the important stakeholders are included in the sustainability planning. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, failing to include the individuals who deliver the practice or program (e.g., 
</p>
<p>The Role of&nbsp;Implementation Science in&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>112
</p>
<p> clinicians or teachers) may lead to issues with long-term buy-in (Cooper, Bumbarger, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Moore, 2015).
</p>
<p>Planning for sustainability should be an ongoing discussion that takes place from 
</p>
<p>the initial exploration stage. This allots time dedicated to planning for long-term 
</p>
<p>financing, commitment and organizational support, training and coaching for the 
</p>
<p>workforce, and procedural evaluation and monitoring (Chambers et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>IS has clearly defined the difficulties of bringing programs of proven efficacy into 
</p>
<p>the community where they may serve the public interest. For the researcher, it is 
</p>
<p>clear that simply developing a program with the expectation that it will be adopted 
</p>
<p>readily into the field is na&iuml;ve. While preliminary studies may narrowly focus on 
</p>
<p>exemplary conditions to demonstrate an intervention is effective, it behooves the 
</p>
<p>researcher to move into the community to assess effectiveness as well.
</p>
<p>For the practitioner in the field, there is an opportunity to work collaboratively to 
</p>
<p>identify the critical components of interventions and work to match those demands 
</p>
<p>to the needs and characteristics of the organization, the community, and the clientele 
</p>
<p>for whom the program is intended. This bi-directional effort that links the practitio-
</p>
<p>ner to the researcher strengthens not only the development of programs and their 
</p>
<p>relevance for the community but also helps identify and build the conditions under 
</p>
<p>which new programs may be maximally effective.
</p>
<p>A collaborative process can be established by which consumers, families, prac-
</p>
<p>ticing clinicians, communities, and cultures develop common agendas for the 
</p>
<p>improvement of service outcomes and actively participate through all stages of pro-
</p>
<p>gram development and implementation (Baumbusch et&nbsp; al., 2008; Gonzales, 
</p>
<p>Ringeisen, &amp; Chambers, 2002; Green, 2008; Hoagwood et&nbsp;al., 2001; McDonald &amp; 
</p>
<p>Viehbeck, 2007). Models for this approach include community-based participatory 
</p>
<p>research (CBPR), which strays from traditional applied research paradigms and 
</p>
<p>strives to incorporate community partnership and action-oriented approaches to 
</p>
<p>behavioral health research (Minkler &amp; Wallerstein, 2013).
</p>
<p>In addition, IS training efforts that prepare researchers for program development 
</p>
<p>and implementation may also benefit from expanded opportunities to work in com-
</p>
<p>munity settings. For example, service-learning opportunities that place researchers 
</p>
<p>in the settings where programs are implemented offers training opportunities for 
</p>
<p>expanding the implementation process and strengthening the cooperation between 
</p>
<p>program implementers and program users (Burton, Levin, Massey, Baldwin, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Williamson, 2016).
</p>
<p>The push for policy and regulations requiring EBPs in multiple health services, 
</p>
<p>lack of buy-in from health practitioners, and poor dissemination methods for evi-
</p>
<p>dence remain critical in the research-to-practice gap. Estimates suggest it can take 
</p>
<p>up to 17&nbsp;years for EBPs to make their way from research to practice (Green, Ottoson, 
</p>
<p>Garcia, &amp; Hiatt, 2009). IS addresses this gap by assisting researchers and

</p>
<p> communities with the translation of research to real-world practice by identifying 
</p>
<p>the implementation factors that are essential for consistent, sufficient, and effective 
</p>
<p>use of EBPs. IS is an essential driver for ensuring effective and efficacious programs 
</p>
<p>and practices and will lead to significant health benefits for the diverse populations 
</p>
<p>and communities requiring behavioral health services.

<p>Challenges with&nbsp;Behavioral Health 
Services Research Data
</p>
<p>Ardis&nbsp;Hanson and&nbsp;Bruce&nbsp;Lubotsky&nbsp;Levin
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Behavioral health services research is a multidisciplinary area of study that evolved 
</p>
<p>during the 1980s. Those who participate in behavioral health services research 
</p>
<p>examine the organization, financing, and delivery of behavioral health systems and 
</p>
<p>services and the implications for cost, quality, access, and outcomes. While the 
</p>
<p>broad field of behavioral health services research has continued to rapidly evolve 
</p>
<p>over the past 30&nbsp;years, there has been an accompanying exponential growth in the 
</p>
<p>amount and type of data.
</p>
<p>This chapter examines the complexity of data being generated by a multitude of 
</p>
<p>individuals and organizations within the various areas of behavioral health (alcohol, 
</p>
<p>drug abuse, and mental health) services research. It will also examine the role of 
</p>
<p>technology in the complexity of services research and in accessing research data-
</p>
<p>bases. In addition, this chapter will identify some of the major databases in behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health services research and illustrate the complexity of collecting, organizing, 
</p>
<p>and accessing information from a vast array of data collection sources.

</p>
<p> Behavioral Health System Challenges
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; behavioral health systems are very complex. They have numerous 
</p>
<p>distinct sectors, organizational settings, financing streams, and differences in the 
</p>
<p>type and duration of care. These systems are comprised of public sector services, 
</p>
<p>private sector services, and increasingly hybridized services crossing over both pub-
</p>
<p>lic and private sectors (Hanson &amp; Levin, 2013). The existing delivery systems pro-
</p>
<p>vide acute and long-term care in homes, communities, and institutional settings. In 
</p>
<p>addition, these systems provide services across the specialty behavioral health sec-
</p>
<p>tor, the general primary care sector, and the voluntary care sector. In the United 
</p>
<p>States, various other sectors that provide behavioral health services include the mili-
</p>
<p>tary, the Veterans Administration (VA), long-term care facilities, and the criminal 
</p>
<p>justice systems (e.g., juvenile facilities, jails, and prisons) (Hanson, 2014).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are multiple stakeholders involved in these systems, from 
</p>
<p>providers to clients. There are numerous federal, state, local, and tribal agencies, 
</p>
<p>professional licensing and accreditation organizations, managed care provider orga-
</p>
<p>nizations, advocacy and regulatory agencies, and healthcare policy-making entities 
</p>
<p>involved with impacting policy and services delivery. Stakeholders also include ser-
</p>
<p>vice users of all ages, their families, and their caregivers (including family mem-
</p>
<p>bers, advocates, guardians ad litem, and ombudsmen). Providers include clinicians, 
</p>
<p>such as psychologists, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, mental 
</p>
<p>health counselors, pastoral counselors, primary care providers, pharmacists, sup-
</p>
<p>portive services personnel, vocational and rehabilitation staff, administrative and 
</p>
<p>clerical staff, and peer and lay workers, among many others who work in the pre-
</p>
<p>vention, intervention, and treatment of individuals with behavioral health problems. 
</p>
<p>The number and variety of interested stakeholders, in turn, contribute to the com-
</p>
<p>plexity of collecting, maintaining, and accessing data in behavioral health service 
</p>
<p>delivery systems.
</p>
<p>Collecting data and the use of technology to develop information systems in 
</p>
<p>behavioral health service systems are not new initiatives. Rosen and Weil (1997) 
</p>
<p>described the use of electronic office management and psychological assessment 
</p>
<p>software in clinical practice. Sujansky (1998) wrote the need for decision support 
</p>
<p>tools and bibliographic retrieval systems, such as PubMed, to be embedded in the 
</p>
<p>then-emerging electronic health record (EHR). Others have written the use of the 
</p>
<p>Internet and national administrative data to collect behavioral health data, to address 
</p>
<p>changes to existing services systems, and to establish mental health promotion cam-
</p>
<p>paigns (Andrade et&nbsp; al., 2014; Berry, Lobban, Emsley, &amp; Bucci, 2016; Rhodes, 
</p>
<p>Bowie, &amp; Hergenrather, 2003).
</p>
<p>Today, numerous types of networked informatics programs and applications 
</p>
<p>handle in-house administrative tasks, such as billing and scheduling, as well as 
</p>
<p>many functions within the managed care environment, such as certifications, autho-
</p>
<p>rizations, treatment plans, medication evaluation forms, treatment summary forms, 
</p>
<p>and outcome assessments, and reporting requirements at the state and national level. 
</p>
<p>Transportability issues surrounding innovations (such as treatment effectiveness 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>121
</p>
<p>and treatment context), standardization of terminology to reduce ambiguity, quality 
</p>
<p>of care issues, and building improved behavioral health information and practice 
</p>
<p>infrastructures continue to be addressed at the federal, tribal, and state levels.
</p>
<p>As discussed throughout this volume, the often fragmented and rapidly changing 
</p>
<p>policy and practice landscape exacerbates the lag between development and ulti-
</p>
<p>mate implementation of innovative, empirically tested practices which may take 
</p>
<p>between 15 and 20&nbsp; years for actual implementation (President&rsquo;s New Freedom 
</p>
<p>Commission on Mental Health, 2003).
</p>
<p>Further, the rapid change in behavioral health technology over the past decade 
</p>
<p>has brought even more volatility to research and practice settings. For example, not 
</p>
<p>only are &ldquo;soft&rdquo; behavioral health service technologies particularly vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>problems of fidelity in implementation (Allen, Shelton, Emmons, &amp; Linnan, 2018); 
</p>
<p>there also are significant challenges to implementing and sustaining comprehensive 
</p>
<p>behavioral health service programs at consumer, provider, program administrator, 
</p>
<p>and developer levels (Aarons et&nbsp;al., 2012; Chaudoir, Dugan, &amp; Barr, 2013; Gotham, 
</p>
<p>2004; Williams, Ehrhart, Aarons, Marcus, &amp; Beidas, 2018).
</p>
<p>Since challenges come from and across service, interorganizational, and con-
</p>
<p>sumer/advocacy sectors, intraorganizational and individual levels, and system/envi-
</p>
<p>ronment fit, specific data needed to address these challenges may become difficult 
</p>
<p>to tease out, define, collect, or synthesize. These are universal challenges for nations, 
</p>
<p>regardless of socioeconomic status of countries or levels of technologies easily 
</p>
<p>available to their citizens. Today&rsquo;s multiple systems for the delivery of behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services represent an increasingly diversified, interrelated, and complex 
</p>
<p>information framework where data are collected, information is synthesized, and 
</p>
<p>treatment, law, and policy decisions are made based upon the available data.
</p>
<p> Behavioral Health Services Research Data
</p>
<p>There are three main types of data in behavioral health services research: (1) pri-
</p>
<p>mary data, (2) secondary data, and (3) tertiary data. Primary data are original, often 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;raw&rdquo; data that can be in any format (e.g., numeric, spatial, textual, or interview 
</p>
<p>data). Secondary data are analyses run on primary data that interpret, review, or 
</p>
<p>synthesize original research. One example would be a report that repurposes a 
</p>
<p>county infrastructure and services data for a neighborhood assessment of benefits 
</p>
<p>and deficits. Another example is a summary report generated from the Centers for 
</p>
<p>Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s (CDC) Web-Based Injury Statistics Query and 
</p>
<p>Reporting System (WISQARS&trade;) mortality and morbidity database. Tertiary data 
</p>
<p>are the synthesis of data and secondary reports that place repurposed and/or col-
</p>
<p>lected data within a specific context within behavioral health services research. An 
</p>
<p>example would be an agency report that included a series of articles from a peer- 
</p>
<p>reviewed journal on formulary management with cost data from a report from 
</p>
<p>Massachusetts on its public formulary.
</p>
<p>Challenges with&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services Research Data</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>122
</p>
<p>However, behavioral health services research is complex. Often a research proj-
</p>
<p>ect or research data may address only a very specific portion of a larger issue. There 
</p>
<p>are bits and pieces of data from multiple publishers/carriers/vendors across different 
</p>
<p>time frames and in different formats. Further, not only are there numerous disci-
</p>
<p>plines that work within behavioral health services research; there are different 
</p>
<p>weights given to different types or elements of data and how these data may be used 
</p>
<p>within those disciplines and professional practices. Numeric data, for example, in 
</p>
<p>the form of actual datasets or predefined tables of variables, may be available for 
</p>
<p>public use through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) federal data management 
</p>
<p>requirements for research conducted under receipt of a federal grant (NIH, 2003, 
</p>
<p>February 26) or through the Open Government Directive, a presidential memoran-
</p>
<p>dum signed by former President Barack Obama (2009).
</p>
<p>While there are a significant variety of data sets in behavioral health at the fed-
</p>
<p>eral level, they do not always exist in formats immediately usable for all individuals 
</p>
<p>accessing these databases. For example, data are collected for a variety of federal 
</p>
<p>data sets and organized into very different information formats (e.g., numeric, spa-
</p>
<p>tial, and textual) and contexts (e.g., clinical, statistical, and services delivery). The 
</p>
<p>data are collected based upon specific objectives established for data collection and 
</p>
<p>are based upon the specific plans for the utilization of that data set. Two examples 
</p>
<p>are QuickFacts and FastStats.
</p>
<p>QuickFacts, by the US Census Bureau, is a very thin slice of data that estimates 
</p>
<p>selected characteristics of a population of a specific place at a specific point in time, 
</p>
<p>as well as selected business and geographical data. However, data from a QuickFacts 
</p>
<p>page comes from 12 different Census Bureau datasets: (1) Population Estimates, (2) 
</p>
<p>American Community Survey, (3) Census of Population and Housing, (4) Current 
</p>
<p>Population Survey, (5) Small Area Health Insurance Estimates, (6) Small Area 
</p>
<p>Income and Poverty Estimates, (7) State and County Housing Unit Estimates, (8) 
</p>
<p>County Business Patterns, (9) Non-employer Statistics, (10) Economic Census, (11) 
</p>
<p>Survey of Business Owners, and (12) Building Permits.
</p>
<p>A second example is the Mental Health FastStats from the National Center for 
</p>
<p>Health Statistics. It offers four central data points: (1) morbidity, (2) physician office 
</p>
<p>visits, (3) emergency room visits, and (4) mortality, with links to other reports that 
</p>
<p>may also be of interest as well as other related agency data or sites. And while users 
</p>
<p>can also look for FastStats on depression, there are no corresponding pages for 
</p>
<p>schizophrenia, bipolar, or anxiety disorders. These examples reinforce some of the 
</p>
<p>problems with publically accessible datasets and predefined tables, such as the 
</p>
<p>granularity of data one may be seeking is not available through these resources; the 
</p>
<p>combination of variables one is seeking may not be available; and the age of the data 
</p>
<p>may make them unusable in a more current context. These problems plague many 
</p>
<p>of the publicly available federal, state, and academic data.
</p>
<p>Data also may be repurposed from primary data into secondary data analyses or 
</p>
<p>tertiary data sources, such as reports and white papers. Information on how data are 
</p>
<p>collected or characteristics of state behavioral health agency data systems for fed-
</p>
<p>eral systems should always be reviewed to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the 
</p>
<p>data for researchers and practitioners. Reports, such as Characteristics of State

</p>
<p>Mental Health Agency Data Systems (Lutterman, Phelan, Berhane, Shaw, &amp; Rana, 
</p>
<p>2008) or the most recent Mental Health Client-Level Data/Mental Health Treatment 
</p>
<p>Episode Data Set (MH-CLD/MH-TEDS) for services provided through state mental 
</p>
<p>health agencies, provide information on what researchers and practitioners may or 
</p>
<p>may not find in agency data systems.
</p>
<p>A basic EHR system, for example, may contain patient history and demograph-
</p>
<p>ics, a patient problem list, physician clinical notes, a comprehensive list of patient&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>medications and allergies, computerized orders for prescriptions, and laboratory 
</p>
<p>and imaging results. However, other documentation, such as the reports mentioned 
</p>
<p>above, often include crosswalk tables, reporting methods, data dictionaries of 
</p>
<p>included variables, federal definitions used in the reports, and behavioral health 
</p>
<p>diagnosis codes. Federal legislation, such as the 45 CFR 170 (2011), addresses stan-
</p>
<p>dards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria that apply to the EHR 
</p>
<p>and EHR modules.
</p>
<p> Public Domain and&nbsp;Public Sector Data
</p>
<p>Federal and state governments are moving to digital-only data and documents avail-
</p>
<p>able on the Internet. Public domain data and public sector data are not interchange-
</p>
<p>able (Abresch, Hanson, &amp; Reehling, 2008). Public domain is a legal status, that is, 
</p>
<p>items in the public domain are copyright-free. Public domain material may be modi-
</p>
<p>fied, giving the person who did the modification both intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>and copyrights for the modification, not the original product.
</p>
<p>Public sector data, however, are data produced by a public sector body. These 
</p>
<p>data may either be in the public domain or be protected data. Governmental and 
</p>
<p>institutional policies determine access, which potentially vary. Since constitutional, 
</p>
<p>federal, or state law may govern access to public sector information, changes in 
</p>
<p>access to government information, particularly after passage of the Homeland 
</p>
<p>Security Act, potentially affect content and access (Abresch et&nbsp;al., 2008).
</p>
<p>There are licensing and distribution issues associated with the use of primary and 
</p>
<p>secondary data sets, such as data size, format complexity, and potential use restric-
</p>
<p>tions. These restrictions may be due to copyright, access, or license agreements 
</p>
<p>created by either public or private data producers. There are also intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights, liability issues, distribution methods, and data management practices to 
</p>
<p>address in the acquisition, use, repurposing, and publishing of data and its results. 
</p>
<p>There may be significant legal risks related to numeric and spatial data and analysis 
</p>
<p>tools, including models, methodologies, and services, based upon the data and tools. 
</p>
<p>Defective data used in decision-making may have consequences at a planning or 
</p>
<p>population-based level of policy or practice. Since behavioral health services 
</p>
<p>research often uses personal data obtained with informed consent, there may be 
</p>
<p>restrictions and authorizations required for its use, with de-identified, aggregated 
</p>
<p>data used in the final product.
</p>
<p>Challenges with&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services Research Data</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>124
</p>
<p> Definitional Data
</p>
<p>The first question in collecting data on behavioral disorders starts with definition 
</p>
<p>and contextualization. In the United States, the authoritative guide to the diagnosis 
</p>
<p>of behavioral disorders is the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); the 
</p>
<p>international standard for behavioral health diagnosis is the ICD-11 (International 
</p>
<p>Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) in concert with the ICF 
</p>
<p>(International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) to determine 
</p>
<p>burden of disease (World Health Organization, 2017, 2018b).
</p>
<p>While the ICD is used for reporting diseases, health conditions, and baseline 
</p>
<p>statistics, the ICF is used to classify the functional components of health conditions. 
</p>
<p>Also, there is language in the ICD-11 that suggests a relationship between the clini-
</p>
<p>cal effects of mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders and the ability 
</p>
<p>of individuals to function effectively across interpersonal, family, social, educa-
</p>
<p>tional, occupational, and other levels of functioning. The ICF extends the context of 
</p>
<p>disability (level of functioning) to environmental factors. This is an important con-
</p>
<p>sideration, as there is a continued global focus on the social determinants of health 
</p>
<p>and how these determinants and their effects can be collected (Atkinson, Page, 
</p>
<p>Wells, Milat, &amp; Wilson, 2015; Hosseini Shokouh et&nbsp;al., 2017; Thomsen et&nbsp;al., 2013; 
</p>
<p>Vest, Grannis, Haut, Halverson, &amp; Menachemi, 2017; World Health Organization, 
</p>
<p>2016).
</p>
<p> Behavioral Health System Data
</p>
<p>Data can focus on an individual, an at-risk population, a facility, or a system. In the 
</p>
<p>United States, behavioral health system data spans private and public providers 
</p>
<p>(including both individual and organizational providers) of care, treatment and 
</p>
<p>delivery, financing of care, law, and policy. It also spans medicine, social services, 
</p>
<p>and rehabilitation. Behavioral healthcare data may address acute (or crisis) or long- 
</p>
<p>term (maintenance) care. Although behavioral healthcare takes place in hospitals, 
</p>
<p>providers&rsquo; offices, community mental health centers, peer-run centers, religious 
</p>
<p>organizations (pastoral care), academic health centers, jails and prisons, state or 
</p>
<p>local government facilities, and private facilities, not all of these facilities are 
</p>
<p>required to collect or report to or across local, state, regional, or national entities 
</p>
<p>(see Fig.&nbsp;1).
</p>
<p>Common measures include behavioral health service history, severity and level 
</p>
<p>of functioning, and quality assessment. Behavioral health service history is the 
</p>
<p>patient&rsquo;s treatment history, defined as whether he/she had ever received behavioral 
</p>
<p>health treatment prior to the current episode of care and, if so, where.
</p>
<p>Severity and level of functioning measures an individual&rsquo;s level of everyday 
</p>
<p>functioning and comparison with premorbid (before onset of diseases) functioning. 
</p>
<p>Relevant aspects of daily living include daily living skills, social and recreational 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>125
</p>
<p>skills, and financial, vocational, interpersonal, and parental skills. The point of mea-
</p>
<p>suring level of functioning is to assess how much the illness has affected the person. 
</p>
<p>This information is then used to design appropriate levels of psychosocial treatment 
</p>
<p>and relevant social supports.
</p>
<p>Quality assessment tools include individual treatment and system performance 
</p>
<p>indicators, report cards, and consumer outcome measures, all of which use guide-
</p>
<p>line fidelity measures (standards).
</p>
<p>Data and assessment tools are comprised of domains that are issues, categories, 
</p>
<p>or topics of interest. Indicators are discrete measurable activities, events, character-
</p>
<p>istics, or items that represent a domain. Measures are the instruments used to assess, 
</p>
<p>evaluate, and measure an indicator.
</p>
<p>In addition, behavioral health data is collected and used in a number of ways, 
</p>
<p>such as client information systems and decision support functions. Such systems 
</p>
<p>and functions would need to contain enough data to provide clinical consultations, 
</p>
<p>update disease profiles, and create semantic relationships to map algorithms for 
</p>
<p>diagnoses and etiologies. To achieve requires production rules, hierarchical classifi-
</p>
<p>cation trees, heuristic questions, and diagnostic criteria. Production rules would 
</p>
<p>require probabilities to ensure findings are related accurately to diagnoses. 
</p>
<p>Hierarchical classification tree(s) would represent disease categories and allow 
</p>
<p>mapping to preferred, narrower, and current terminology. In addition, heuristic 
</p>
<p>questions and evidence-based diagnostic criteria would be necessary to narrow the 
</p>
<p>diagnostic hypotheses and conclude the clinical query. However, these and other 
</p>
<p>elements are critical to ensure precision and relevance in discovery.

</p>
<p>All types of data (computational, spatial, social, and environmental) increasingly 
</p>
<p>are used in behavioral health services research. Integration of research into practice, 
</p>
<p>the development of &ldquo;best practices,&rdquo; fidelity in implementation, and the issues sur-
</p>
<p>rounding translational research require more and more data and use many different 
</p>
<p>lenses and tools to view the data. Data mining large quantitative datasets, modeling 
</p>
<p>real-life phenomena, and prediction or forecasting of long-term behaviors and activ-
</p>
<p>ity are common activities in data collection and analysis.
</p>
<p> Behavioral Health Clinical Data
</p>
<p>Behavioral health clinical data exists in many forms. There is the raw data (i.e., 
</p>
<p>patient-level fact data), knowledge data (best practices), aggregate patient data at 
</p>
<p>the facility or system level, and surveillance data; any or all may be reported in vary-
</p>
<p>ing degrees across local, state, national, regional, and global reporting levels. Data 
</p>
<p>comes from medical records, administrative data, incidence data, patient satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion surveys, and more (see Table&nbsp;1).
</p>
<p>Linking client data from different health and behavioral healthcare sectors and 
</p>
<p>agencies is necessary to assure the continuity of care, evaluation, and planning of 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services. Integrating client, human resources, financial, services, 
</p>
<p>and organizational databases create a foundation for both clinical and administrative 
</p>
<p>data-based decision support and for programmatic and outcomes evaluation, pro-
</p>
<p>gram planning, and research. Reuse of behavioral health clinical data is found 
</p>
<p>across numerous settings, from clinical, research, governmental, and business, and 
</p>
<p>is often dependent on the source of data and the models used in the studies (Hutter, 
</p>
<p>Rodriguez-Ibeas, &amp; Antonanzas, 2014).
</p>
<p>Three common models address cost-effectiveness, cost utility, or quality of life. 
</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of treatment in healthcare facilities examines 
</p>
<p>health outcomes more one-dimensionally, as in the number of psychotic events pre-
</p>
<p>vented or number of life years a patient gained. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) moves 
</p>
<p>to two-dimensional measures, such as measures of change in patient survival and 
</p>
<p>changes in the quality of a patient life. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) mea-
</p>
<p>sures often are multiplied by number of life years gained, which then generates the 
</p>
<p>number quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by the patient. These analyses 
</p>
<p>also use patient survey data and cost data in a hospital or network. Table&nbsp;2 shows a 
</p>
<p>common CEA data collection and analysis process.
</p>
<p>Data collection in healthcare facilities falls under process management (i.e., task/
</p>
<p>procedure processes, standardization, coordination, reorganization, using a cross- 
</p>
<p>functional viewpoint examining strategy, operations, techniques, and people). This 
</p>
<p>is particularly key as healthcare facilities, systems, and provider networks continue 
</p>
<p>to automate their administrative processes to derive outcomes, quality improve-
</p>
<p>ment, and assessment data on patient care and business operations. However, three 
</p>
<p>major challenges to the effective analysis, use, and decision-making with data are 
</p>
<p>incomplete data and undefined management processes (Monto et&nbsp;al., 2016), as well 
</p>
<p>as knowing what to count.

<p> Knowing What to&nbsp;Count in&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>One of the most challenging factors in collecting data on behavioral disorders is what 
</p>
<p>data elements are collected. This ranges from setting, status as a primary or second-
</p>
<p>ary diagnosis, levels of functioning, family, and societal burden. In 2001a, the World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization&rsquo;s (WHO) World Health Report acknowledged the burden of 
</p>
<p>mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders. Almost a decade later, the 
</p>
<p>2010 Global Burden of Disease Study confirmed that nearly one quarter of all years 
</p>
<p>lived with a disability (DALYS) can be attributed to behavioral disorders (Murray 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2012; Vos et&nbsp;al., 2012; Whiteford et&nbsp;al., 2013). As part of the larger group of 
</p>
<p>noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), MNS disorders account for more than 60% of 
</p>
<p>Challenges with&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services Research Data</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>128
</p>
<p>deaths worldwide and frequently occur as comorbid disorders with both NCD and 
</p>
<p>infectious diseases (Bahorik, Satre, Kline-Simon, Weisner, &amp; Campbell, 2017; 
</p>
<p>Charlson et&nbsp;al., 2016; Goodell, Druss, Walker, &amp; Mat, 2011; Prince et&nbsp;al., 2007).
</p>
<p>However, without addressing the relatedness of comorbid NCDs, infectious dis-
</p>
<p>ease, and MNS, a paradox is created. MNS disorders are often less acknowledged 
</p>
<p>in a global integrated health context, but often play a major part in a patient&rsquo;s quality 
</p>
<p>of life, level of functioning, burden of disease, wellness, and years lived with a dis-
</p>
<p>ability. Hence, achieving desired outcomes for global and national health programs 
</p>
<p>becomes more problematic, especially when looking at the issues involved in gath-
</p>
<p>ering accurate data to answer the questions asked and yet to be asked.
</p>
<p> How the&nbsp;ICD and&nbsp;ICF Are Used
</p>
<p>The ICD is used extensively for the diagnostic classification of routine collection of 
</p>
<p>population-based health information (morbidity and mortality) and for the manda-
</p>
<p>tory statistical reporting required of WHO member countries. Depending upon the 
</p>
<p>level of information required, the ICD ranges from a set of 100 codes to 10,000 
</p>
<p>codes which can be related to diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) and other case-mix 
</p>
<p>systems. Categories include &ldquo;diseases, disorders, syndromes, signs, symptoms, 
</p>
<p>findings, injuries, external causes of morbidity and mortality, factors influencing 
</p>
<p>health status, reasons for encounter of the health system, and traditional medicine,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>complemented by additional data on &ldquo;anatomy, substances, infectious agents, or 
</p>
<p>place of injury&rdquo; (World Health Organization, 2018a). From a classification perspec-
</p>
<p>tive, each ICD entity has a unique identifier (URI) and is grouped within and across 
</p>
<p>hierarchies of groups, categories, and narrower terms. For a more detailed discus-
</p>
<p>sion on the elements of the ICD-11, see the WHO ICD-11 Reference Guide.
</p>
<p>The ICD is increasingly used in the public health sector as a frame for (1) acces-
</p>
<p>sible services that address epidemiology, natural course of a disease, and disease 
</p>
<p>burden of these disorders and (2) health promotion efforts to destigmatize mental 
</p>
<p>illnesses (International Advisory Group, 2011). More recent discussions on the ICD 
</p>
<p>suggest its importance in research, including formative, case-controlled, and clini-
</p>
<p>cal utility field studies, national diagnostic quality studies, and administrative data 
</p>
<p>reviews (Gologorsky, Knightly, Lu, Chi, &amp; Groff, 2014; Keeley et&nbsp;al., 2016; Nesvag 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2017). More importantly, the recent revision of the ICD (ICD-11) includes a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;functioning properties&rdquo; component that integrates the ICF activities and participa-
</p>
<p>tion domains specific to disorders along with body functions and contextual factors 
</p>
<p>(Escorpizo et&nbsp;al., 2013). The intent of the ICD-ICF cross-coding is to improve oper-
</p>
<p>ationalization of an integrated disease-functioning model across health systems in 
</p>
<p>all countries, from low resource to high resource.
</p>
<p>Over the past 30&nbsp;years, the ICD has been steadily integrated into national health 
</p>
<p>policy and clinical care by the governments of WHO Member States (countries) 
</p>
<p>through a number of stakeholder groups. These diverse groups include clinical care 
</p>
<p>providers, healthcare coverage and reimbursement agencies, social and community 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>support services, disability benefits agencies, payers of healthcare services, con-
</p>
<p>sumer and family advocacy groups, government agencies, criminal justice systems, 
</p>
<p>educational systems, and judicial systems (International Advisory Group for the 
</p>
<p>Revision of ICD-10 Mental and Behavioural Disorders, 2011). However, not all 
</p>
<p>WHO Member States gather data from all of these trajectories of care.
</p>
<p> Underreporting Prevalence
</p>
<p>A major challenge in behavioral health data is underreporting. This means accurate 
</p>
<p>and representative data on the prevalence of disorders is difficult to define. A num-
</p>
<p>ber of resources are used to define prevalence, from medical and national records 
</p>
<p>and epidemiologic and survey data to meta-regression modeling. However, raw data 
</p>
<p>for countries that lack adequate collection and reporting infrastructure require com-
</p>
<p>parisons that are created running sophisticated statistical models on epidemiologic 
</p>
<p>data from neighboring countries. This affects studies, such as the Global Burden of 
</p>
<p>Disease (GBD) studies, which rely upon epidemiological studies for its global and 
</p>
<p>national estimates. These studies may not match data across age groups, countries, 
</p>
<p>disorders, and epidemiologic parameters (Whiteford, Ferrari, &amp; Degenhardt, 2016). 
</p>
<p>To compensate, the GBD researchers use a specific statistical tool, Bayesian meta- 
</p>
<p>regression, which (1) pools the epidemiological data available for a given disorder 
</p>
<p>into a weighted average and (2) adjusts for known sources of variability in reported 
</p>
<p>study estimates (Whiteford et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>Since disorders and prevalence are not defined the same across researchers or 
</p>
<p>nations, it can be confounding to compare data. For example, the GBD prevalence 
</p>
<p>data on depression varies from the prevalence data used by the WHO, which varies 
</p>
<p>from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prevalence of 
</p>
<p>depression. Unlike the GBD and the WHO definitions of depression, the CDC 
</p>
<p>includes anxiety as a subset of depression in its examination of the prevalence of 
</p>
<p>depression (Whiteford et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p> Underreporting Population Subgroups
</p>
<p>There is a relative lack of standards for collecting data on population subgroups. 
</p>
<p>Numerous policy documents, such as the Sustainable Development Goals or Healthy 
</p>
<p>People 2020, promote the elimination of health disparities1 (US) or health inequities 
</p>
<p>(WHO) as an overarching goal for the next decade. However, attaining this elusive 
</p>
<p>1 Health disparities include but are not limited to language; culture; socioeconomic status; gender; 
</p>
<p>age; mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; 
</p>
<p>geographic location (e.g., rural vs. urban); or other characteristics historically linked to discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion or exclusion, such as race or ethnicity.
</p>
<p>Challenges with&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services Research Data</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>130
</p>
<p>goal has been challenging. The lack of standardized data relevant to the many fac-
</p>
<p>tors that identify vulnerable and at-risk populations makes it difficult to identify and 
</p>
<p>implement effective actions to reduce specific health disparities. Health disparities/
</p>
<p>inequities are closely linked with the social and physical determinants of health 
</p>
<p>(e.g., social, economic, and/or environmental factors) that affect health, level of 
</p>
<p>functioning, and quality of life outcomes. A social determinants approach can help 
</p>
<p>reframe the way policy-makers, public and private sectors, and the general public 
</p>
<p>think about achieving and sustaining behavioral health.
</p>
<p> Addressing Pathology and&nbsp;Etiology
</p>
<p>Since their respective inceptions DSM (American Psychiatric Association, 1952); 
</p>
<p>ICD (International Statistical Institute, 1893); ICF (World Health Organization, 
</p>
<p>2001b), these diagnostic standards have been the benchmarks for how behavioral 
</p>
<p>disorders are diagnosed and &ldquo;accounted&rdquo; in incidence, prevalence, and treatment 
</p>
<p>data. In addition, the ICD and DSM are used heavily in public health, clinical diag-
</p>
<p>nosis, service provision, and specific research applications. However, their categori-
</p>
<p>cal and dimensional models fail to address the pathology and etiology of these 
</p>
<p>disorders. The National Institute of Mental Health&rsquo;s Research Domain Criteria 
</p>
<p>(RDoC) provides a different framework for understanding MNS disorders, includ-
</p>
<p>ing etiology, categories and dimensions, disorder thresholds, and comorbidity 
</p>
<p>(Clark, Cuthbert, Lewis-Fernandez, Narrow, &amp; Reed, 2017).
</p>
<p>In the RDoC, etiology examines mental disorders from a multi-causality frame, 
</p>
<p>in that these disorders develop from multiple influences (e.g., physiological, envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental, and societal). This parallels the SDH and social and behavioral determi-
</p>
<p>nants of health (SBD) frames. Mental disorders are complex, dimensional disorders, 
</p>
<p>and different categories of disorders often have common, overlapping characteris-
</p>
<p>tics. Hence, categorizing mental disorders and their dimensions is problematic. 
</p>
<p>Disorder thresholds are central in clinical decision-making; however, thresholds 
</p>
<p>may vary greatly based on which component is under review (e.g., emotional, 
</p>
<p>behavioral, cognitive, or physical) and can have negative or positive consequences 
</p>
<p>(e.g., stigma or eligibility). Comorbidity denotes the simultaneous co-occurrence of 
</p>
<p>two distinct disorders; however, Clark et&nbsp; al. (2017) suggest that co-existence of 
</p>
<p>mental disorders may be a better way of framing the complexity and interrelated-
</p>
<p>ness of mental disorders.
</p>
<p> Data and&nbsp;Standards
</p>
<p>An EHR documents (1) each episode (evaluation and treatment) of a patient&rsquo;s ill-
</p>
<p>ness, (2) the plan for patient care and recovery, and (3) communication between all 
</p>
<p>patient care staff. From an administrative perspective, the EHR is used for fiscal 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>131
</p>
<p>review and evaluation of the care and services, as it is a record of all events over 
</p>
<p>time and locations. Since the EHR holds identifiable patient data, it is subject to 
</p>
<p>legislative, regulatory, and confidentiality requirements at the staff, facility, pro-
</p>
<p>vider, state, and national levels.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, there are standards for the collection, coding, classification, and 
</p>
<p>exchange of clinical and administrative data for behavioral health. Terminology, 
</p>
<p>data interchange, and knowledge representation schema are the most common stan-
</p>
<p>dards. Much like a controlled vocabulary, there are specific terms and concepts used 
</p>
<p>to describe, classify, and code healthcare data, as well as to create relationships 
</p>
<p>among the terms and concepts. Data interchanges encode healthcare data elements 
</p>
<p>for exchange among facilities, providers, and networks. Knowledge representation 
</p>
<p>schema codify how healthcare literature, clinical guidelines, and other information 
</p>
<p>are used for clinical decision-making within the EHR or how other clinical or 
</p>
<p>administrative documents link to or use information from the EHR.
</p>
<p>The global emphasis on the social determinants of health and the Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals (SDGs) has effects on the acquisition of a number of health 
</p>
<p>indicators, especially to show national achievements of the SDGs. However, the 
</p>
<p>success of a global health initiative depends on the development of a series of stan-
</p>
<p>dards for national health infrastructures. A health record is but one tiny part of a 
</p>
<p>national health infrastructure, which also must address interorganizational and 
</p>
<p>cross-system communication, such as storage, processing, and transmission hard-
</p>
<p>ware and physical facilities, software applications, and network standards.
</p>
<p>National and international standards for programming languages, operating sys-
</p>
<p>tems, data formats, communications protocols, applications interfaces, services 
</p>
<p>delivery, and record formats ensure compatibility and interoperability between sys-
</p>
<p>tems and compatibility of data for comparative statistical or analytical purposes. 
</p>
<p>Standards also establish a common ontology and ensure conformity assessment and 
</p>
<p>usability.
</p>
<p>Standards may also limit data collection, especially in remote or rural areas. 
</p>
<p>National definitions of what constitutes a village, town, city, or metropolitan area 
</p>
<p>vary significantly. Many national statistical systems provide data at the province or 
</p>
<p>state level, with national definitions of what constitutes an urban area, a city, a town, 
</p>
<p>an unincorporated area, or a village. If everything outside the &ldquo;urban&rdquo; class is des-
</p>
<p>ignated as rural or the level of administrative oversight stops several steps above the 
</p>
<p>village area, as may be the case in low- or lower-middle-income countries, then 
</p>
<p>population data may be under- or overestimated. How a nation or locale defines a 
</p>
<p>geographic area or its level of administrative oversight affects how it classes popula-
</p>
<p>tions, settings, and workforce in its data collection and in final analyses of such. 
</p>
<p>These &ldquo;definitional caveats,&rdquo; which may or may not be stated in health or accompa-
</p>
<p>nying statistical reports, may affect our understanding of a national or locale.
</p>
<p>Standards also play an important part in the development and use of monitoring 
</p>
<p>and evaluation frameworks. National health information systems rely upon a range 
</p>
<p>of population-based and health facility-based data sources, such as census data, 
</p>
<p>household surveys, vital registration systems, public health surveillance, adminis-
</p>
<p>trative data, health services data, and health system monitoring data, derived from 
</p>
<p>Challenges with&nbsp;Behavioral Health Services Research Data</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>132
</p>
<p>local, state, regional, and national sources. With the development of the SDGs, a 
</p>
<p>common monitoring and evaluation framework to strengthen health systems is 
</p>
<p>essential (World Health Organization, 2010).
</p>
<p>Health systems and research on these systems are often framed around financing, 
</p>
<p>organization, payment, services delivery, and regulation (Hoffman et&nbsp; al., 2012, 
</p>
<p>February 29). However, not all instances of the same theoretical framework are 
</p>
<p>equivalent; hence, it is important to determine if there has been any divergence or 
</p>
<p>convergence from or to a given standard framework or definition. Consider the case 
</p>
<p>of universal health coverage (UHC). Although many countries rely on disaggre-
</p>
<p>gated survey data coupled with facility data, the survey data does not occur 
</p>
<p> frequently enough to be a reliable indicator of current health sector performance. A 
</p>
<p>focus on levels of health services coverage and equitable financial protection can 
</p>
<p>provide indicators on how well a system is moving toward achieving UHC (Boerma 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p>From both global and national perspectives, syntheses of health data sources 
</p>
<p>should focus on monitoring performance, harmonizing indicators and measurement 
</p>
<p>strategies, and reconciliation of system disparities and discrepancies within and 
</p>
<p>across systems. Harmonizing national indicators to a global measurement strategy 
</p>
<p>may be problematic. To partner with WHO&rsquo;s monitoring and evaluation framework 
</p>
<p>for health systems performance assessment and the SDG goals, US health data may 
</p>
<p>need to be crosswalked to WHO, United Nations, and World Bank frameworks, 
</p>
<p>among others. Since global indicators are used in comparative analyses, data quality 
</p>
<p>assurance is critical across the breadth of diverse healthcare systems and policies. 
</p>
<p>Data quality frameworks that can be used across national and global levels add 
</p>
<p>complexity to the data collection, management, sharing, and conduct of analyses. 
</p>
<p>Hence, it is critical to ensure for each metric or framework used there is consistency 
</p>
<p>in the standards adopted to ensure objectivity and comparability over time and 
</p>
<p>across localities, states, regions, and countries.
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>We talk about the importance of numbers in behavioral health services delivery, 
</p>
<p>research, practice, and policy. Numbers are rhetorical devices, support implementa-
</p>
<p>tion, drive policy, determine need, and determine success of treatment. Numbers are 
</p>
<p>important. If you cannot be counted, you simply do not exist. A state (as in a coun-
</p>
<p>try) has no obligation to you.
</p>
<p>Examining the discussion on data presented above, we can articulate, with cer-
</p>
<p>tainty, the following conclusions. First, data are difficult to collect, and despite 
</p>
<p>efforts to systematize diagnosis, sociocultural differences may complicate the com-
</p>
<p>parability of internationally collected metrics. Second, the lack of standardized data 
</p>
<p>collection instruments, such as a unique patient tracking number, and differing care 
</p>
<p>protocols make it challenging to maintain continuity of care, much less accurate 
</p>
<p>data on trajectory of care or prevalence and incidence.

</p>
<p>Health services research aims to be inclusive of all relevant information, both in 
</p>
<p>terms of a grounded appreciation of the positive and negative benefits of a specific 
</p>
<p>therapeutic intervention and a statement of the implications for the service. The 
</p>
<p>need for reliable data on clinical and cost-effectiveness and a range of other contex-
</p>
<p>tual information require practitioners and academics to accommodate &ldquo;research&rdquo; as 
</p>
<p>part of everyday practice.
</p>
<p>In 2009, former President-elect Obama announced that large-scale adoption of 
</p>
<p>health IT was a priority and that all US residents were to have EHR within 5&nbsp;years. 
</p>
<p>Federal legislation supported the electronic sharing of clinical data among health-
</p>
<p>care stakeholders, which includes federal agencies responsible for the collection, 
</p>
<p>analysis, and synthesis of such data. However, a decade after that announcement, 
</p>
<p>the United States has not reached its goal.
</p>
<p>There are multiple players, at many levels of government and in the private sec-
</p>
<p>tor, who collect data and create information designed to answer specific questions 
</p>
<p>or to fulfill reporting requirements. National standards, initiatives, and architecture 
</p>
<p>try to make sense of their concerns and issues, focusing on infrastructure efforts, 
</p>
<p>standards harmonization; certification; nationwide network, privacy, and security 
</p>
<p>issues; and health IT adoption.
</p>
<p>However, national data on behavioral health services in the United States remains 
</p>
<p>incomplete at best. Not all behavioral health or behavioral health services data are 
</p>
<p>collected, and in some cases, there are no formal structures or legal requirements in 
</p>
<p>place to capture that data. To effectively handle just the linguistic properties of text, 
</p>
<p>standardized language codes must support document longevity and interoperability 
</p>
<p>of computing and network solutions. The same applies to the creation of network 
</p>
<p>and platform protocols. Standards, whether data, semantic, or syntactic, apply 
</p>
<p>equally to querying, searching, and accessing information from both vendor and the 
</p>
<p>end-user perspectives. However, the issues of sharing information across numerous 
</p>
<p>platforms and the variety of data types have not been made any easier. This is par-
</p>
<p>ticularly true as we move to an increasingly global reporting on behavioral health-
</p>
<p>care, services delivery, and systems design. There is a need to monitor global health 
</p>
<p>regulations, health metrics (by country and perhaps even at a more granular level, 
</p>
<p>such as county or region), disease surveillance systems, architectures, standards, 
</p>
<p>and information systems.
</p>
<p>There are numerous issues surrounding just standards development and linguis-
</p>
<p>tic congruence for health data. These data have implications on resource allocation, 
</p>
<p>human development, quality of life, regional and economic development, and 
</p>
<p>human security. Add additional issues of disability, functional outcomes, commu-
</p>
<p>nity reintegration, and resiliency. How many ways can these issues be defined and 
</p>
<p>granulized into indicators locally and nationally in the United States, across profes-
</p>
<p>sional groups, government agencies, consumer and family groups, and advocacy 
</p>
<p>groups? Now consider how we reach consensus on definitions and indicators glob-
</p>
<p>ally. The possibility of having accurate data, the same comparative indicators, and 
</p>
<p>globally adopted outcomes literally comes back to decades of recommendations 
</p>
<p>leading to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and similar national and 
</p>
<p>regional initiatives.

</p>
<p> Policies and&nbsp;Practices to&nbsp;Support School Mental Health
</p>
<p>Providing mental health services to children and youth in schools has been found to 
</p>
<p>be an effective and innovative approach to reaching at-risk or hard-to-reach youth 
</p>
<p>(Sklarew, Twemlow, &amp; Wilkinson, 2004; Zirkelback &amp; Reese, 2010). A rich history 
</p>
<p>of literature and research supports the use of mental health services in schools. 
</p>
<p>School-based programs that support the mental well-being of children and youth not 
</p>
<p>only promote wellness but have been linked to improved academic achievement and 
</p>
<p>behavioral functioning among school-aged youth (Crespi &amp; Howe, 2002; Owens &amp; 
</p>
<p>Murphy, 2004). The failure of the nation&rsquo;s child mental health system to fully 
</p>
<p>address the mental health needs of children and adolescents has been well docu-
</p>
<p>mented and highlights the urgency to reconsider current policy and practice (Burns 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 1995; Kataoka et&nbsp; al., 2003; Simon, Pastor, Reuben, Huang, &amp; Goldstrom, 
</p>
<p>2015). Furthermore, the need for school mental health services is detailed in special 
</p>
<p>education regulations and national reports indicating that schools should provide 
</p>
<p>services that target the mental health needs of youth (National Academies of 
</p>
<p>Sciences, Engineering, &amp; Medicine, 2018a, 2018b; President&rsquo;s New Freedom 
</p>
<p>Commission on Mental Health, 2003; U.S.&nbsp;Department of Education, 2018).
</p>
<p>Research indicates that of the small percentage of children and adolescents who 
</p>
<p>receive mental health services, schools are the most common setting in which 
</p>
<p> children access this care (Carta, Fiandra, Rampazzo, Contu, &amp; Preti, 2015; Demissie,

<p>Oarker, &amp; Vernon-Smiley, 2013; Farmer, Burns, Phillips, Angold, &amp; Costello, 2003; 
</p>
<p>Office of the Surgeon General, 2000). Further, data indicate these services are 
</p>
<p>indeed reaching youths, including students from ethnic minority groups and those 
</p>
<p>with less obvious problems, such as depression and anxiety, who are unlikely to 
</p>
<p>access services in specialty mental health settings (Foster &amp; Connor, 2005; Kataoka 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2003; Ramos &amp; Alegr&iacute;a, 2014).
</p>
<p>School mental health (SMH) services provide youth increased access to services 
</p>
<p>by reducing many of the barriers to seeking traditional services, such as transporta-
</p>
<p>tion, cost, and stigma (Weist, Lever, Bradshaw, &amp; Sarno Owens, 2013). Providing 
</p>
<p>services within schools can provide a neutral environment whereby youth learn that 
</p>
<p>seeking out help and support is commonplace and exists within a continuum of 
</p>
<p>provided supports (e.g., academic supports, physical health services). Offering a 
</p>
<p>broad range of universal, targeted, and intensive mental health support services to 
</p>
<p>youth in schools has been supported by a public health framework that recognizes 
</p>
<p>the diverse needs of children and families (Kleiver &amp; Cash, 2005; Short, 2003).
</p>
<p>Many states have implemented such multitiered systems of support so that chil-
</p>
<p>dren and youth quickly and effectively can access a diverse range of services, 
</p>
<p>requiring individuals other than those solely at the highest level of risk receive atten-
</p>
<p>tion (Doll &amp; Cummings, 2008). By providing a range of services, schools are able 
</p>
<p>to help address many of the barriers to learning that children and youth may experi-
</p>
<p>ence at some point throughout their school trajectory.
</p>
<p>Evidence indicates that more comprehensive SMH, involving community-based 
</p>
<p>and school staff increasing the intensity and comprehensiveness of services, 
</p>
<p>improves children&rsquo;s outcomes. It increases the likelihood of first appointment after 
</p>
<p>referral (Catron, Harris, &amp; Weiss, 2005), subsequent retention in services (Atkins 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2006), and more effective outreach to underserved communities (Anyon, Ong, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Whitaker, 2014; Armbruster &amp; Lichtman, 1999; Atkins et&nbsp;al., 2015), particularly 
</p>
<p>for those children presenting less observable &ldquo;internalizing&rdquo; disorders like depres-
</p>
<p>sion and anxiety (Atkins et&nbsp; al., 2006; Weist, Myers, Hastings, Ghuman, &amp; Han, 
</p>
<p>1999). There is also an evidence base for research-supported prevention and inter-
</p>
<p>vention programs in schools (Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor, &amp; Schellinger, 
</p>
<p>2011; Elliott &amp; Mihalic, 2004; Mihalic &amp; Elliott, 2015). However, we must caution 
</p>
<p>there needs to be solid empirical literature showing that mental health services 
</p>
<p>delivered in schools are superior to those delivered in other settings.
</p>
<p> Review of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Literature
</p>
<p> Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Concerns
</p>
<p>Approximately 20% of children experience significant mental, emotional, or 
</p>
<p>behavioral symptoms that would qualify them for a psychiatric diagnosis at 
</p>
<p>both national and global levels (National Research Council &amp; Institute of 
</p>
<p>K. Eklund et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>141
</p>
<p>Medicine, 2009). Not only does the prevalence of those conditions and indica-
</p>
<p>tors increase with age (Perou et&nbsp;al., 2013), behavioral disorders are the leading 
</p>
<p>causes for years lived with a disability for children and adolescents (Baranne &amp; 
</p>
<p>Falissard, 2018; Mokdad et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, 9&ndash;13% of young people will experience a serious emotional distur-
</p>
<p>bance with substantial functional impairment, while 5&ndash;9% will experience a serious 
</p>
<p>emotional disturbance with extreme functional impairment (Friedman, Katz-Leavy, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Sondheimer, 1996). Unfortunately, only 15&ndash;30% of the children who demon-
</p>
<p>strate mental health concerns receive any type of help or support.
</p>
<p>In order to address the gap in providing mental health services to children and 
</p>
<p>youth, the President&rsquo;s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) called 
</p>
<p>for a transformation in the delivery of mental health services in this country. School 
</p>
<p>mental health services were suggested as one strategy in beginning to address many 
</p>
<p>of the unmet mental health needs of children and youth (Atkins, Hoagwood, Kutash, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Seidman, 2010). As children currently receive more services through schools 
</p>
<p>than through any other system, school- and community-employed clinicians are 
</p>
<p>well positioned to provide mental health supports in schools (Larson, Spetz, Brindis, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Chapman, 2017).
</p>
<p> History of&nbsp;School Mental Health
</p>
<p>The provision of school mental health services originates from four co-occurring 
</p>
<p>initiatives. First was the placement of nurses in schools as a public health approach 
</p>
<p>to detect and treat illness that evolved into the establishment of school-based health 
</p>
<p>centers across the United States. Second was the creation of child guidance clinics 
</p>
<p>that evolved into community mental health centers with the passage of the 
</p>
<p>Community Mental Health Act of 1963 (Public Law 88-164). Third was the passage 
</p>
<p>of Public Law 94-142&nbsp; in 1975 and its reauthorization as the Individuals with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1997 that resulted in the hiring of school- 
</p>
<p>employed mental health professionals. The final initiative was the emergence of the 
</p>
<p>expanded school mental health movement which brought community-based mental 
</p>
<p>health professionals into schools to not only consult with teachers but provide direct 
</p>
<p>services to children and families.
</p>
<p> School Nursing and&nbsp;School-Based Health Centers
</p>
<p>Employing nurses in the school setting largely resulted from the overwhelming 
</p>
<p>number of eastern European immigrants moving to urban areas of the United States 
</p>
<p>in the early part of the twentieth century without access to basic healthcare. In the 
</p>
<p>early years, school nurses were effective at addressing health problems that inter-
</p>
<p>fered with student&rsquo;s learning. In fact, rates indicate that the percentage of students 
</p>
<p>who missed school due to illness substantially declined from 10,567&nbsp;in 1902&ndash;1101&nbsp;in 
</p>
<p>Policies and&nbsp;Practices to&nbsp;Support School Mental Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>142
</p>
<p>1903 (Hawkins, Hayes, &amp; Corliss, 1994). However, the school nurses&rsquo; role was 
</p>
<p>limited to physical health promotion and prevention of illness and injury. At that 
</p>
<p>time, children&rsquo;s emotional well-being in relation to mental disorders was not recog-
</p>
<p>nized as affecting student&rsquo;s academic and social functioning.
</p>
<p>By the 1960s, school-based health centers (SBHCs) started to emerge from what 
</p>
<p>had previously been termed public health clinics and through the provision of ser-
</p>
<p>vices delivered via school nurses. SBHCs began to flourish in the 1980s, growing 
</p>
<p>from 200 centers in 1990, to 1380&nbsp;in 2001, and 1909 centers in 45 states by 2010 
</p>
<p>(U.S.&nbsp;Government Accountability Office, 2010). The SBHCs primarily employed 
</p>
<p>nurse practitioners and/or physician&rsquo;s assistants. With the emerging recognition that 
</p>
<p>many of the visits to the SBHC were related to mental health concerns (Lear, 
</p>
<p>Gleicher, St. Germaine, &amp; Porter, 1991), the SBHCs expanded their role to include 
</p>
<p>mental health counseling provided by a master&rsquo;s level mental health clinician.
</p>
<p> Child Guidance Clinics and&nbsp;Community Mental Health Centers
</p>
<p>Child guidance clinics began as community-based centers that provided psycho-
</p>
<p>logical therapeutic and assessment services for children with mental health con-
</p>
<p>cerns and their families. Originating in Chicago in 1909, the clinics embraced an 
</p>
<p>interdisciplinary approach to service provision by employing social workers, psy-
</p>
<p>chologists, and psychiatrists to best meet the needs of children with mental health 
</p>
<p>concerns (Witmer, 1940). The implementation of the Community Mental Health 
</p>
<p>Centers (sCMHC) Construction Act of 1963 (Pub. Law 88-164) initiated the deliv-
</p>
<p>ery of mental health consultation and intervention services to children and adoles-
</p>
<p>cents via CMHCs. The Walter P.&nbsp; Carter Center in Baltimore, MD, served as a 
</p>
<p>seminal provider of school mental health services by establishing relationships with 
</p>
<p>local schools in the community. The Carter Center provided on-site consultation 
</p>
<p>with educators and discussed children receiving services at the centers&rsquo; four clinics. 
</p>
<p>These clinics established a foundation for the later development of expanded school 
</p>
<p>mental health (ESMH) programs.
</p>
<p> Public Law 94-142 and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Individuals with&nbsp;Disabilities Education Act 
</p>
<p>(IDEA)
</p>
<p>Originally passed as Public Law 94-142 in 1975, the IDEA mandates that schools 
</p>
<p>serve all students, including those with learning or emotional disabilities. From its 
</p>
<p>inception, IDEA facilitated the hiring of school mental health professionals, such as 
</p>
<p>psychologists and social workers, to provide mental health supports to students. For 
</p>
<p>example, schools hired school psychologists to conduct IDEA-required student 
</p>
<p>evaluations to determine the degree of disability and necessary educational accom-
</p>
<p>modations (Flaherty &amp; Osher, 2003). The shift of mental health professionals from 
</p>
<p>the community to employment as school staff members included providing services 
</p>
<p>to students with emotional and behavioral challenges (Flaherty &amp; Osher, 2003).
</p>
<p>K. Eklund et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>143
</p>
<p>While early provisions of IDEA outlined service provisions to youth who met set 
</p>
<p>criteria, it failed to address an organized and systemic approach to providing school 
</p>
<p>mental health services. For example, students identified as emotionally disturbed 
</p>
<p>(ED) had especially poor outcomes compared to students under other eligibility 
</p>
<p>criteria, which may have been a primary driver in the development and expansion of 
</p>
<p>SMH programming (Osher &amp; Hanley, 1996).
</p>
<p>In 1997, IDEA amendments further expanded the educational opportunities and 
</p>
<p>support for students with ED.&nbsp; These revisions provided a broader role for both 
</p>
<p>school- and community-employed practitioners to assist with delivery of services to 
</p>
<p>youth via individualized educational plans. These amendments represent the grow-
</p>
<p>ing recognition of the need to provide prevention services to intervene when youth 
</p>
<p>display at-risk behaviors rather than postponing intervention until students&rsquo; symp-
</p>
<p>toms require more intensive placement or supports. IDEA provided a solid founda-
</p>
<p>tion for not only expanded service delivery but also expanded school mental health 
</p>
<p>(ESMH) programs.
</p>
<p> Expanded School Mental Health Programs
</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the concept of &ldquo;expanded&rdquo; SMH emerged with early successes defined 
</p>
<p>by the building of the child guidance clinic and CMHC models. This idea involved 
</p>
<p>augmenting pre-existing school-based programs and roles that had been primarily 
</p>
<p>focused on special education and crisis response services, toward a broad-based role 
</p>
<p>of mental health supports (Weist, 1997). CSMH services included individual, fam-
</p>
<p>ily, and group psychotherapy, consultation with teachers and families, as well as 
</p>
<p>mental health promotion and education. Several cities, including Baltimore, 
</p>
<p>Maryland, demonstrated early success related to ESMH and brought about the 
</p>
<p>receipt of significant federal funding in 1995 to establish the Center for School 
</p>
<p>Mental Health (CSMH) at the University of Maryland as a national training and 
</p>
<p>technical assistance center. The CSMH was funded by the Maternal and Child 
</p>
<p>Health Bureau&rsquo;s Mental Health of School-Age Children and Youth Initiative, which 
</p>
<p>also provided funding to the University of California at Los Angeles&rsquo; Center for

<p>Mental Health in Schools, as well as five state infrastructure grants to Kentucky, 
</p>
<p>Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, and South Carolina.
</p>
<p>Since 1995, the field of ESMH has grown significantly because of several efforts, 
</p>
<p>including a national conference hosted by the CSMH, collaboration with the IDEA 
</p>
<p>Partnership, and federal investment by the US Department of Education Office of 
</p>
<p>Special Education Programs. These results have created a national Community of 
</p>
<p>Practice on Collaborative School Behavioral Health, as well as 12 practice groups 
</p>
<p>and 17 state groups, and a number of books and journals (Weist et&nbsp;al., 2013).
</p>
<p>With this growth, the field came to represent more than just the original concep-
</p>
<p>tualization of community-employed professionals providing mental health services 
</p>
<p>in schools. As the emphases on public health frameworks, prevention science, and 
</p>
<p>interdisciplinary collaboration emerged, the field of ESMH became known simply 
</p>
<p>as school mental health (SMH). The change in acronyms better represented a

</p>
<p>school- and community-wide approach inclusive of a team of school and commu-
</p>
<p>nity mental health professionals partnering with youth and families to provide a 
</p>
<p>public health continuum of promotion, prevention, early intervention, and treatment 
</p>
<p>services.
</p>
<p> Public Health Models that Support a&nbsp;Multitiered Framework
</p>
<p>Conversations regarding the provision of school mental health services have been 
</p>
<p>prominent in educational policy dialogues in recent years. Legislative acts continue 
</p>
<p>to address the need for a collaborative focus on mental health in schools, such as the 
</p>
<p>School Safety and Mental Health Services Improvement Act (2018), with an empha-
</p>
<p>sis on preventative measures that deter the seemingly increasing incidence of crisis 
</p>
<p>events in educational settings (Birkland &amp; Lawrence, 2009; Crepeau-Hobson, 
</p>
<p>Sievering, Armstrong, &amp; Stonis, 2012). However, conversations among SMH prac-
</p>
<p>titioners examining the importance of an integrated mental health model of service 
</p>
<p>delivery predate contemporary comments by legislators on service implementation 
</p>
<p>methods (Cowen &amp; Lorion, 1976; Windle &amp; Woy, 1983). These early discussions 
</p>
<p>referenced the ineffective nature of traditional reactive methodologies, which are 
</p>
<p>designed to provide services only when concerns arise, echoing a &ldquo;wait-to-fail&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>model of service delivery (Albers, Glover, &amp; Kratochwill, 2007). Consequently, 
</p>
<p>students who do not manifest robust externalizing behaviors, for example, may not 
</p>
<p>be identified with missed opportunities for early intervention.
</p>
<p>This gap in service has resulted in research to address the short- and long-term 
</p>
<p>deleterious effects (e.g., academic, social, emotional) that may emerge from unmet 
</p>
<p>mental health concerns among children and youth (Perou et&nbsp;al., 2013). The 1999 
</p>
<p>Surgeon General&rsquo;s Report on Mental Health first highlighted the need for preventa-
</p>
<p>tive measures to effectively decrease the negative impact mental health concerns 
</p>
<p>may have on youth (Office of the Surgeon General, 1999). Alternative models of 
</p>
<p>service delivery are warranted, including those that reinforce the importance of 
</p>
<p> collaboration between parents, educators, and mental health practitioners in schools 
</p>
<p>and communities (Weist, Lowie, Flaherty, &amp; Pruitt, 2001).
</p>
<p>The public health approach incorporates an ecological framework in addressing 
</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s mental health by acknowledging the influence of multiple systems on 
</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s difficulties. This includes integrating systems of care for youth, including 
</p>
<p>but not limited to child welfare, education, health, juvenile justice, mental health, 
</p>
<p>and social services (Blau, Huang, &amp; Mallery, 2010; Stiffman et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Although the public health model is holistic in nature, its goals do not oppose 
</p>
<p>those in public education. The public health model goals are designed to supple-
</p>
<p>ment the current educational structure, build a bridge between school- and 
</p>
<p>community- based services, promote partnerships between family systems and the 
</p>
<p>school, and organize formative research that reflects the climate of the school so 
</p>
<p>that the model can be tailored to students&rsquo; needs (Nastasi, 2004). This approach 
</p>
<p>is strength-based and culturally and environmentally sensitive and prescribes a 
</p>
<p>K. Eklund et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>145
</p>
<p>continuum of mental health services ranging from activities that support and 
</p>
<p>maintain positive mental health to prevention and treatment efforts (Blau et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2010; Office of the Surgeon General, 1999). Emerging research highlights a few 
</p>
<p>examples, such as multitiered system of supports, that illustrate the effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of the public health model in children&rsquo;s mental health services (Miles, Espiritu, 
</p>
<p>Horen, Sebian, &amp; Waetzig, 2010).
</p>
<p>Similar in design, a multitiered system of support (MTSS) framework aims to 
</p>
<p>provide a continuum of care that combines the efforts of communities, families, and 
</p>
<p>schools. The MTSS framework, however, is defined by the application of high- 
</p>
<p>quality interventions and positive behavioral supports at various levels or &ldquo;tiers.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Extant literature describes response to intervention (RtI) and positive behavioral 
</p>
<p>interventions and supports (PBIS) as MTSS approaches that target specific barriers 
</p>
<p>to learning while amplifying the integration of evidence-based interventions and 
</p>
<p>supports until the obstacles to learning are addressed (Batsche et&nbsp; al., 2005; 
</p>
<p>Sulkowski, Wingfield, Jones, &amp; Alan Coulter, 2011).
</p>
<p>These systems underscore the role of prevention and wellness through the activa-
</p>
<p>tion of multiple tiers (i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary) and progress monitoring. 
</p>
<p>Organizing services in this way allows stakeholders to engage in a systematic data- 
</p>
<p>based decision-making process that promotes the implementation of programming 
</p>
<p>and services that meet the mutable needs of students.
</p>
<p>However, despite the multitiered design of PBIS, a common concern in these 
</p>
<p>systems is the insufficient development of Tier 2 and 3 systems and practices, result-
</p>
<p>ing in unaddressed behavioral and emotional needs for students with more complex 
</p>
<p>mental health concerns. In addition, PBIS Tier 1 systems, although showing success 
</p>
<p>in social climate and discipline, do not typically address broader community data 
</p>
<p>and mental health prevention (Barrett et&nbsp;al., 2017). Newer models, whose principles 
</p>
<p>parallel those within the MTSS framework, aim to address these gaps.
</p>
<p>The Interconnected Systems Framework (ISF), for example, borrows from the 
</p>
<p>strengths of PBIS, implementation science, and RtI to create a healthy merger with 
</p>
<p>school mental health (Eber, Weist, &amp; Barret, 2014). At its core, ISF capitalizes on 
</p>
<p>the use of (1) effective collaborations between community and mental health 
</p>
<p> providers; (2) data-based decision-making; (3) formal evaluation and implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of evidence-based practices (EBP); (4) early access via comprehensive screen-
</p>
<p>ings; (5) rigorous progress monitoring for both fidelity and effectiveness; and (6) 
</p>
<p>ongoing training and coaching at system and practice levels. The benefits of this 
</p>
<p>model are influential in both economic and social schemes: children and adoles-
</p>
<p>cents will gain earlier access to high-quality EBPs; professional roles will be 
</p>
<p>clearly defined, particularly among school- and community-employed mental 
</p>
<p>health staff; and cross- training will endorse common language, communication, 
</p>
<p>and engagement among all parties: students, parents, community members, and 
</p>
<p>school staff.

</p>
<p> School Mental Health Services in&nbsp;Multitiered Systems of&nbsp;Support
</p>
<p>Within the public health framework of a multitiered system of support, such as the 
</p>
<p>Interconnected Systems Framework, a collaborating team of education and mental 
</p>
<p>health professionals provides a range of services across a continuum of assessment, 
</p>
<p>intervention, and consultation services (Andis et&nbsp;al., 2002). This includes anything 
</p>
<p>from accessing accommodations in the classroom (e.g., extended time, a quiet 
</p>
<p>workspace, break cards) to more targeted and intensive services, such as the provi-
</p>
<p>sion of individual and small group counseling services.
</p>
<p>Universal strategies, often referred to as Tier 1 supports, traditionally provide a 
</p>
<p>platform for promotion and prevention activities. They may also include social- 
</p>
<p>emotional learning programs, welcoming and social support programs for new stu-
</p>
<p>dents and their families, staff development on positive behavior supports, violence 
</p>
<p>prevention, coordination of a universal screening program, efficient referral mecha-
</p>
<p>nisms, and/or the development of crisis prevention and response procedures (Elliott 
</p>
<p>&amp; Tolan, 1998).
</p>
<p>The second level of support often is referred to as targeted services, or Tier 2 
</p>
<p>interventions. This may include small group counseling for issues such as social 
</p>
<p>skills, anger control, or depressive symptoms, psychoeducation and consultation 
</p>
<p>with parents and families for issues related to bullying and peer conflicts, and/or 
</p>
<p>daily behavior report cards to teach and reinforce positive replacement behaviors 
</p>
<p>(National Association of School Psychologists, 2015).
</p>
<p>The most intensive level of support services are offered at Tier 3 to selected indi-
</p>
<p>viduals. Services commonly include psychological, psychoeducational, and/or 
</p>
<p>functional behavioral assessments, individual and family counseling, a coordinated 
</p>
<p>system of care, referrals to community service agencies, crisis intervention and 
</p>
<p>response, and/or home-based programs (Andis et&nbsp;al., 2002; Splett, Fowler, Weist, 
</p>
<p>McDaniel, &amp; Dvorsky, 2013).
</p>
<p>Across these tiers, SMH services include data-based decision-making, imple-
</p>
<p>mentation support, and consultation and collaboration. Data-based decision-making 
</p>
<p>includes using data to determine what services are needed and are working for an 
</p>
<p>entire school (Tier 1), small group of students (Tier 2), and individual students (Tier 
</p>
<p>3). This includes formative and summative evaluation to monitor progress of 
</p>
<p> prevention and intervention activities, as well as evaluate their overall efficacy and 
</p>
<p>implementation fidelity.
</p>
<p>Implementing evidence-based programs and practices as intended is an essential, 
</p>
<p>yet often ignored, aspect of delivering an effective continuum of mental health ser-
</p>
<p>vices in schools. Research indicates the need for access to implementation supports 
</p>
<p>such as coaching, training, and technical assistance to promote high-quality imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of evidence-based programs in &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; settings (Fixsen, Naoom, 
</p>
<p>Blase, Friedman, &amp; Wallace, 2005).
</p>
<p>Thus, a conduit for providing effective mental health services in schools is cer-
</p>
<p>tainly access to a strong infrastructure of implementation supports. Similarly, con-
</p>
<p>sultation and collaboration with parents, youth, teachers, school administrators, 
</p>
<p>other mental health professionals, and key community stakeholders are critical to 
</p>
<p>K. Eklund et al.</p>
<p/>

<p>147
</p>
<p>effective SMH services (Weist et&nbsp;al., 2005). Consultation and collaboration promote 
</p>
<p>engagement and service quality across the continuum of services.
</p>
<p> Critical Issues in&nbsp;School Mental Health
</p>
<p> Providing School Mental Health Services
</p>
<p>A critical challenge in the field is effectively addressing the question of why mental 
</p>
<p>health services should be provided in schools. Often times, schools may view men-
</p>
<p>tal health services as &ldquo;add-ons&rdquo; that are not central to the academic mission of 
</p>
<p>schools (School Mental Health Alliance, 2004), and traditional school reform efforts 
</p>
<p>focus on student learning, teaching strategies, and non-cognitive barriers to devel-
</p>
<p>opment (Burke, 2002; Koller &amp; Svoboda, 2002). While educators may be willing to 
</p>
<p>address barriers to student learning, they often do not recognize that social- emotional 
</p>
<p>well-being is essential to academic success (Klem &amp; Connell, 2004). National 
</p>
<p>efforts, such as the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2001), the President&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Commission on Excellence in Special Education (2002), and the Every Student 
</p>
<p>Succeeds Act (ESSA, 2015), place priority on academic goals and may minimize 
</p>
<p>attention to the social-emotional or mental health needs of students. There are pro-
</p>
<p>visions in national legislation that focus on health promotion and risk reduction 
</p>
<p>(e.g., safe and drug-free schools in the NCLB Act and reducing risk for serious 
</p>
<p>emotional disturbance in the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health report, 
</p>
<p>2003). However, policy reform still is needed at the local, state, and federal levels to 
</p>
<p>include a focus on how behavioral and academic outcomes can be highly correlated 
</p>
<p>(Nastasi, 2004).
</p>
<p>Providing school mental health services within a public health model differs from 
</p>
<p>traditional service delivery models as the explicit focus is on a community or society 
</p>
<p>as opposed to any one individual. Theoretically, this perspective is well aligned with 
</p>
<p>ecological systems perspectives, as proposed by Bronfenbrenner (1979), in which 
</p>
<p>individuals and systems are mutually influential. Within an  ecological framework, 
</p>
<p>each student is at the center of a series of concentric circles, which represent increas-
</p>
<p>ingly expanding, mutually influential systems. For lasting impact to occur, change 
</p>
<p>must occur at a broader level than just within an individual.
</p>
<p>If the focus of school mental health services is to provide prevention, interven-
</p>
<p>tion, and response services to children and youth, the educational context by which 
</p>
<p>services are delivered must also be a core consideration. Namely, teachers spend 
</p>
<p>countless hours with students each day and often become intimately familiar with 
</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s behavior, routines, and abilities. As many disorders often arise for the 
</p>
<p>first time in adolescents or young adults, early recognition and treatment increases 
</p>
<p>the chances of better long-term outcomes. However, identification and help-seeking 
</p>
<p>behaviors can only occur if young people and their support systems (e.g., families, 
</p>
<p>teachers, friends) know about early changes produced by mental disorders and how 
</p>
<p>to access help.
</p>
<p>Policies and&nbsp;Practices to&nbsp;Support School Mental Health</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>148
</p>
<p> Universal Screening
</p>
<p>Universal screening is a proactive approach of using brief and efficient measures to 
</p>
<p>identify students at risk for future difficulties (Eklund &amp; Dowdy, 2014; Jenkins, 
</p>
<p>Hudson, &amp; Johnson, 2007). A primary purpose of universal screening pertains to the 
</p>
<p>identification of individual students who have not responded to universal prevention 
</p>
<p>efforts and are likely in need of targeted or intensive supports (Eklund &amp; Tanner, 
</p>
<p>2014; Levitt, Saka, Romanelli, &amp; Hoagwood, 2007).
</p>
<p>Research suggests schools provide an ideal setting for identifying at-risk stu-
</p>
<p>dents due to the large number of youth in school and the ability to provide follow-up 
</p>
<p>care within schools (Glover &amp; Albers, 2007; Levitt et&nbsp;al., 2007). For example, pro-
</p>
<p>viding behavioral supports in schools allows for the modification of environmental 
</p>
<p>contingencies toward the disruption of problem behavior development. On the basis 
</p>
<p>of research that shows positive outcomes may be achieved through early identifica-
</p>
<p>tion and intervention, recent educational policy and legislation place an increasing 
</p>
<p>focus on data-based decision-making and universal assessment in schools (IDEA, 
</p>
<p>2004; (Lane, Robertson Kalberg, Lambert, Crnobori, &amp; Bruhn, 2010; Reschly, 
</p>
<p>2008). Indeed, children with childhood behavioral difficulties who are identified 
</p>
<p>early and receive intervention are likely to make significant gains in positive emo-
</p>
<p>tional and behavioral functioning (Brophy-Herb, Lee, Nievar, &amp; Stollak, 2007; 
</p>
<p>Eklund &amp; Dowdy, 2014).
</p>
<p>Despite this research and screening&rsquo;s status as an essential component of MTSS 
</p>
<p>service delivery, many schools have not begun to adopt universal screening (Bruhn, 
</p>
<p>Woods-Groves, &amp; Huddle, 2014; Romer &amp; McIntosh, 2017). Although reasons for 
</p>
<p>such limited implementation of universal screening abound (Chafouleas, Kilgus, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Wallach, 2010), more understanding of how screening is implemented and whether 
</p>
<p>or not they achieve intended outcomes is needed. While initial research demon-
</p>
<p>strates that screening identifies a group of at-risk students previously unknown to 
</p>
<p>school staff and/or not receiving services (Eklund &amp; Dowdy, 2014), additional 
</p>
<p>research on treatment utility is needed to demonstrate students are receiving 
</p>
<p>improved access to care and ultimately, positive response to early intervention 
</p>
<p>services.
</p>
<p> Parent and&nbsp;Community Partnerships
</p>
<p>One of the greatest strengths of school mental health models is the emphasis on 
</p>
<p>building an alliance between those who have a shared responsibility for the child, 
</p>
<p>particularly models that invite and encourage parent, school, and community 
</p>
<p>involvement. However, efforts to develop links between stakeholders have illumi-
</p>
<p>nated the inadequacy of services and holes in delivery, which subsequently produce 
</p>
<p>a lack of enthusiasm for participation in dialogues on SMH.&nbsp;One qualitative study 
</p>
<p>(Ouellette, Briscoe, &amp; Tyson, 2004) reported that while parents would like to par-
</p>
<p>ticipate in community events and services, the absence of public and private trans-
</p>
<p>portation made following through with these commitments difficult. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>K. Eklund et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>149
</p>
<p>parents reported that too few organizations offer the services they need to build 
</p>
<p>partnerships with the community. The limited availability of after-school program-
</p>
<p>ming and tutor services may contribute to this resistance.
</p>
<p>Service provider&rsquo;s concerns echoed those of parents, citing the importance of 
</p>
<p>transportation services. An increase in public transportation availability may help 
</p>
<p>address these concerns.
</p>
<p>Communication was another noted weakness, as the discourse used by human 
</p>
<p>service workers may fail to convey useful information and strategies for interven-
</p>
<p>tions adequately (Ouellette et&nbsp;al., 2004). Faith-based organizations contributed to 
</p>
<p>the conversation as well, expressing concerns for safe home environments and 
</p>
<p>resources for crisis situations (e.g., clothing, employment, food, shelter).
</p>
<p>Ecological models designed to facilitate conversation between parents, teachers, 
</p>
<p>and community members are gaining recognition. The Positive Attitudes for 
</p>
<p>Learning in School (PALS) model, for example, encourages clinicians and commu-
</p>
<p>nity members to work collaboratively on school-based teams to address concerns 
</p>
<p>unique to the community, in addition to issues arising in academic achievement, 
</p>
<p>behavior management, and social support for parents, teachers, and children 
</p>
<p>(Frazier, Abdul-Adil, Atkins, Gathright, &amp; Jackson, 2007).
</p>
<p>Variations in geographic landscapes may also inform the development of mental 
</p>
<p>health services. The limited availability of services and their proximity to individu-
</p>
<p>als in need, for example, may act as barriers to those in rural communities. 
</p>
<p>Reinforced by restrictions in transportation and the less than desirable fiscal obli-
</p>
<p>gations, families residing in these small rural communities may feel less inclined 
</p>
<p>to pursue services, even if needs are demonstrated (Girio-Herrera, Owens, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Langberg, 2013).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, researchers examining the bridge between mental health and edu-
</p>
<p>cation in urban communities identified socioeconomic status and disconnects 
</p>
<p>between community resources and school supports as major challenges in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of effective services (Cappella, Jackson, Bilal, Hamre, &amp; Soul&eacute;, 
</p>
<p>2011).
</p>
<p>Mobilization of SMH services requires a network of practitioners and research-
</p>
<p>ers who are willing to share jurisdiction over the development, implementation, and 
</p>
<p>evaluation of interventions. Programs like Bridging Education and Mental Health in 
</p>
<p>Urban Schools (BRIDGE) are an example of such a partnership (Cappella, Frazier, 
</p>
<p>Atkins, Schoenwald, &amp; Glisson, 2008). This particular program capitalized on 
</p>
<p>teacher consultation to increase pro-social interactions between students with 
</p>
<p>behavioral difficulties and their classmates. It was designed to connect mental 
</p>
<p>health practitioners with educators so that students receive the most effective form 
</p>
<p>of service delivery possible. Individualized support and teacher observations were 
</p>
<p>at the core of this framework.
</p>
<p>School mental health practitioners are in a unique position to connect parents 
</p>
<p>with community services. School psychologists and school counselors, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, may lead the task of identifying culturally and environmentally sensitive 
</p>
<p>resources that bridge the two contexts for the child (Nastasi, 2004; Nastasi, Varjas, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Moore, 2010). Additionally, SMH providers may find it appropriate to implement 
</p>
<p>Policies and&nbsp;Practices to&nbsp;Support School Mental Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>150
</p>
<p>training programs for parents, teachers, and community members that prioritize 
</p>
<p>learning goals and address concerns voiced by all parties while empowering each 
</p>
<p>group to contribute to the implementation and monitoring of interventions (Cappella 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2008; Nastasi, 2004).
</p>
<p> Evidence-Based, Culturally Sensitive Interventions
</p>
<p>Building partnerships across settings is critical to balancing evidence-based ser-
</p>
<p>vices with cultural sensitivity. While research has demonstrated positive outcomes 
</p>
<p>when evidence-based interventions are tailored to meet culturally diverse needs 
</p>
<p>(Harachi, Catalano, &amp; Hawkins, 1997; Wang-Schweig, Kviz, Altfeld, Miller, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Miller, 2014), other findings indicate the outcomes can be weakened or reduced 
</p>
<p>when unexpected or ill-advised changes occur (Kumpfer, Alvarado, Tait, &amp; Turner, 
</p>
<p>2002; Milburn &amp; Lightfoot, 2016).
</p>
<p>Evidence-based interventions in SMH that allow for cultural adaptation through 
</p>
<p>partnerships with local communities during the dissemination, planning, and imple-
</p>
<p>mentation stages have shown positive outcomes and greater buy-in (Ngo et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2008). For example, exposure to violence is a significant national concern and par-
</p>
<p>ticularly prevalent among minority and ethnically diverse youth (Carothers, Arizaga, 
</p>
<p>Carter, Taylor, &amp; Grant, 2016; Weist &amp; Cooley-Quille, 2001). In recognition of this 
</p>
<p>concern, violence prevention and trauma response have been prioritized by national 
</p>
<p>initiatives and federal funding associated with President Obama&rsquo;s Now is the Time 
</p>
<p>Initiative (The White House, 2013, January 16).
</p>
<p>One evidence-based intervention focused on treating youth exposed to violence 
</p>
<p>from a culturally sensitive framework is Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for 
</p>
<p>Trauma in Schools (CBITS; Jaycox et&nbsp; al., 2007). CBITS prioritizes partnerships 
</p>
<p>with local schools and communities, including stakeholders from parents,  clinicians, 
</p>
<p>community organizations, and faith-based groups throughout all stages of the pro-
</p>
<p>gram. It was developed for and with diverse children and families in mind and has 
</p>
<p>shown positive outcomes in randomized control studies and dissemination evalua-
</p>
<p>tions with Mexican and Central American youth, urban African American students, 
</p>
<p>Native American children, and children in rural communities (Kataoka et&nbsp;al., 2003).
</p>
<p>CBITS includes formal and informal feedback mechanisms, as well as multi- 
</p>
<p>stakeholder planning committees, during local program development and imple-
</p>
<p>mentation planning to ensure the consultation, outreach, training/supervision, 
</p>
<p>evaluation, and service delivery models meet the cultural context while keeping the 
</p>
<p>core cognitive behavioral therapy components intact (Ngo et&nbsp;al., 2008). Tailoring 
</p>
<p>implementation to be culturally sensitive and respectful of the local community is 
</p>
<p>supported by collaboration with cultural liaisons, who have both knowledge of the 
</p>
<p>cultural context and clinical intervention (Ngo et&nbsp; al., 2008). SMH practitioners 
</p>
<p>implementing CBITS or any other evidence-based practice should (1) develop part-
</p>
<p>nerships across stakeholder groups; (2) familiarize themselves with the local cultural 
</p>
<p>context and any individual issues that may arise; (3) stay vigilant in their attention to 
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>151
</p>
<p>the unique needs of their students; and (4) work with others who have cultural 
</p>
<p>knowledge and clinical expertise for collaboration, training, and supervision.
</p>
<p>From a research perspective, more efforts are needed to invite open dialogues 
</p>
<p>and use the cultural experiences of youth to inform the development and delivery of 
</p>
<p>culturally sensitive and specific interventions. Dialogue among a wide range of cul-
</p>
<p>turally diverse stakeholders in SMH is needed to improve the service delivery, con-
</p>
<p>sultation, and evaluation models currently employed in the field. Given issues of 
</p>
<p>disparity and collaboration with parents and families, more dialogues around meth-
</p>
<p>ods to break through these barriers are needed. Additionally, in developing cultur-
</p>
<p>ally specific interventions and/or tailoring existing evidence-based interventions to 
</p>
<p>be more culturally sensitive, ethnographic research is needed to better understand 
</p>
<p>the cultural experience of youth (Anyon et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p>Similar to CBITS, other interventions have been developed because of ethno-
</p>
<p>graphic research, which aimed to expand the literature on students&rsquo; cultural experi-
</p>
<p>ences and in what ways these experiences affect behavioral and academic 
</p>
<p>functioning. In one particular study, four culture-specific themes emerged&mdash;adult- 
</p>
<p>sanctioned behaviors and practices, adolescents&rsquo; perspectives about the present, 
</p>
<p>adolescents&rsquo; aspirations for the future, and societal factors (Varjas, Nastasi, Moore, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Jayasena, 2005). The authors argue these factors should guide the development 
</p>
<p>and implementation of culture-specific interventions and conclude that these factors 
</p>
<p>will intersect in different domains of the ecological framework, including school, 
</p>
<p>family, peer, and community contexts.
</p>
<p> Mental Health Literacy
</p>
<p>Mental health literacy has been recognized as one strategy in facilitating early inter-
</p>
<p>vention for mental health concerns. In this approach, young people and their support 
</p>
<p>systems are taught how to provide appropriate mental health first aid and how to 
</p>
<p>support help-seeking behaviors upon first recognition of a mental health concerns. 
</p>
<p>These interventions can include community campaigns aimed at both youth and 
</p>
<p>adults; school-based interventions that teach help-seeking behavior, mental health 
</p>
<p>literacy, or resilience; and programs training individuals on how to intervene in a 
</p>
<p>mental health encounter or crisis (Kelly, Jorm, &amp; Wright, 2007).
</p>
<p>While there is no standardization of mental health education in schools, initial 
</p>
<p>research suggests mental health literacy can be improved with planned interven-
</p>
<p>tions. Key components may include campaigns tailored to the specific needs and 
</p>
<p>preferences of the intended community that will appeal to different groups (e.g., 
</p>
<p>youth, teachers, parents); ensuring the availability of trusted and established help- 
</p>
<p>seeking pathways among youth; and providing education and accurate information 
</p>
<p>on what to expect when seeking help and obtaining professional support (Kelly 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2007; Rickwood, Deane, Wilson, &amp; Ciarrochi, 2005). Gatekeepers, such as 
</p>
<p>teachers, parents, and other important adults, play an important role in offering help 
</p>
<p>to those who need it most.

</p>
<p> Financing for&nbsp;School Mental Health Services
</p>
<p>It is estimated that childhood emotional and behavioral disorders cost the public 
</p>
<p>$247 billion annually (National Research Council &amp; Institute of Medicine, 2009). 
</p>
<p>Other estimates suggest that in 2012, $13.9 billion was spent for the treatment of 
</p>
<p>mental disorders in children, which was the highest of any children&rsquo;s healthcare 
</p>
<p>expenditures exceeding asthma, trauma-related disorders, acute bronchitis, and 
</p>
<p>infectious disease (Soni, 2015, April). As an estimated 20% of children have a diag-
</p>
<p>nosable mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder, treatment remains one of the 
</p>
<p>most prevalent and costly of all chronic illness in youth.
</p>
<p>Historically, as many as one in seven adolescents have been without health insur-
</p>
<p>ance and therefore have been unable to receive third-party reimbursable mental 
</p>
<p>health services in the private sector (Crespi &amp; Howe, 2002). Reports by the US 
</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services indicated that a disproportionate num-
</p>
<p>ber of children with mental health problems in the United States do not receive 
</p>
<p>mental health services due to a lack of insurance (Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 
</p>
<p>2010, 2018, October). An estimated 2.8 million children are eligible for Medicaid 
</p>
<p>or the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program but are not enrolled currently in either 
</p>
<p>(Kenney, Jennifer, Pan, Lynch, &amp; Buettgens, 2016, May). Sole reliance on providers 
</p>
<p>outside the school environment has placed considerable burden on families without 
</p>
<p>such insurance.
</p>
<p>It is projected that implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
</p>
<p>Act (PPACA), Public Law 111-148 (June 2010), will have a significant impact on 
</p>
<p>the way that healthcare services are delivered, as many youth who were previously 
</p>
<p>uninsured or underinsured will gain access to services. With the expansion of health 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage, many of the most vulnerable populations, such as young chil-
</p>
<p>dren, youth aging out of foster care, and children living in poverty, will have 
</p>
<p>increased access to preventive services, as well as mental health treatment (English, 
</p>
<p>2010). In addition, the authorization of funding for home visitation programs to 
</p>
<p>promote improvements in areas such as child development, parenting, and school 
</p>
<p>readiness will provide opportunities for families who are in the greatest need. The 
</p>
<p>provision of the PPACA to authorize funding to establish and expand school-based 
</p>
<p>health centers has the potential to significantly increase and enhance mental health 
</p>
<p>education, prevention, and early intervention efforts within schools.
</p>
<p>While school mental health programs have grown over the past two decades, iden-
</p>
<p>tifying and securing sustainable funding sources continues to be a concern. Recent 
</p>
<p>studies suggest 70% of school districts reported an increase in need for services but 
</p>
<p>saw funding remain stagnant or decreased (Foster &amp; Connor, 2005). As education 
</p>
<p>systems provide limited funding for SMH services, schools traditionally look to 
</p>
<p>grants or other fee for service programs (e.g., Medicaid). However, sole reliance on 
</p>
<p>these mechanisms may not provide sufficient revenue and can be highly bureaucratic 
</p>
<p>and difficult to obtain (Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, 2003; Evans 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2013; Freeman, 2011). In addition, fee-for-service approaches have created 
</p>
<p>concerns about overdiagnosis, limited time for prevention activities, and an inability 
</p>
<p>K. Eklund et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>153
</p>
<p>to serve students without Medicaid (Lever, Stephan, Axelrod, &amp; Weist, 2004; Mills 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2006). As a result, schools are called upon to explore collaborative and unique 
</p>
<p>funding arrangements to sustain SMH services and programs.
</p>
<p>Sustainable funding is needed to support SMH services. Although there are some 
</p>
<p>potential funding sources that are underutilized (e.g., from Early and Periodic 
</p>
<p>Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, Title I), access 
</p>
<p>to such funds and continued sustainability continue to be a concern for many 
</p>
<p>schools. In order to address these barriers, many programs and services have blended 
</p>
<p>or &ldquo;braided&rdquo; funding, by deriving funding from multiple sources, including grants, 
</p>
<p>contracts, and private agencies (Lever et&nbsp; al., 2004). Fee-for-service revenue has 
</p>
<p>served as a primary source of funding for many mental health services provided in 
</p>
<p>schools. Third-party payers (e.g., Medicaid, State Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance 
</p>
<p>Programs, private insurance) provide reimbursement for mental health services pro-
</p>
<p>vided to children. However, reimbursement is typically limited to those students 
</p>
<p>who have a clinical diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
</p>
<p>Disorders (DSM-5; APA, 2013) for traditional mental health services (e.g., indi-
</p>
<p>vidual and group counseling, family counseling) versus broader SMH services (e.g., 
</p>
<p>teacher consultation, parent consultation, prevention services, case management).
</p>
<p>Sole or primary reliance on fee-for-service models provides a number of barriers 
</p>
<p>to school districts and agencies, including significant paperwork, administrative 
</p>
<p>duties, and managerial responsibilities. Although larger school districts and  agencies 
</p>
<p>may have mechanisms in place to be able to hire and train staff to manage Medicaid 
</p>
<p>billing and services, rural communities and smaller agencies may be at a disadvan-
</p>
<p>tage. Many of these same barriers are placed upon clinicians, who face substantial 
</p>
<p>paperwork that can become burdensome when the primary focus should be on pro-
</p>
<p>viding direct clinical services and preventative care.
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>The SMH field has grown significantly since its beginning days in child guidance 
</p>
<p>clinics and primary focus on expanded models inclusive only of community provid-
</p>
<p>ers. The opportunity to provide mental and behavioral health services within the 
</p>
<p>school setting has been an ongoing goal for many mental health professionals (e.g., 
</p>
<p>social workers, psychologists, counselors) who desire to improve access to care by 
</p>
<p>providing evidence-based interventions to a greater number of children and 
</p>
<p>families.
</p>
<p>Service delivery models that emphasize teaming and collaboration across school, 
</p>
<p>community, and family stakeholders within the system of a multitiered public health 
</p>
<p>continuum of promotion, prevention, early intervention, and treatment are increas-
</p>
<p>ingly showing positive outcomes for children in need. This includes the aforemen-
</p>
<p>tioned Interconnected Systems Framework that combines implementation science, 
</p>
<p>school-based response to intervention models, and PBIS to streamline services for 
</p>
<p>children, families, and educators. This framework provides concrete examples of 
</p>
<p>Policies and&nbsp;Practices to&nbsp;Support School Mental Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>154
</p>
<p>interdisciplinary collaboration among school- and community-based mental health 
</p>
<p>providers as being essential to delivering high-quality evidence-based mental and 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services in schools.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, schools continue to utilize public health models that emphasize 
</p>
<p>prevention through screening and early intervention practices that can eliminate or 
</p>
<p>reduce the severity of behavioral and emotional symptoms when combined with 
</p>
<p>early intervention. However, more work is needed, and critical issues remain.
</p>
<p>The field must continue to emphasize the critical role of mental health in the 
</p>
<p>academic mission of schools and should consider how to intertwine behavioral and 
</p>
<p>academic standards for student success. For example, Illinois Learning Standards 
</p>
<p>now include three social/emotional development standards that students should 
</p>
<p>know and be able to do to varying degrees in grades K-12 (Illinois State Board of 
</p>
<p>Education, 2018). This includes the development of self-awareness and self- 
</p>
<p>management skills, as well as the use of social-awareness and interpersonal skills to 
</p>
<p>establish and maintain positive relationships. These types of educational policies 
</p>
<p>can be instrumental in continuing to advance mental health promotion in the school 
</p>
<p>setting.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Adolescents&rsquo; involvement in the juvenile justice system represents a significant 
</p>
<p>public health problem. Annually, over a one&nbsp;million youth under the age of 18 are 
</p>
<p>arrested in the United States (Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
</p>
<p>Prevention, 2014), with most cases disposed in juvenile courts annually (Furdella 
</p>
<p>&amp; Puzzanchera, 2015). Of those cases, more than a quarter involve females. In 
</p>
<p>2013, juveniles younger than age 16 at the time of referral to court accounted for 
</p>
<p>53% of all delinquency cases handled.
</p>
<p>Approximately 83% of all delinquency cases referred to juvenile court are made 
</p>
<p>by law enforcement (Sickmund &amp; Puzzanchera, 2015). In most states, the juvenile 
</p>
<p>court has jurisdiction over all youth younger than age 18 who were charged with a 
</p>
<p>violation of the law at the time of the offense, arrest, or referral to court. Once a 
</p>
<p>juvenile is adjudicated delinquent in juvenile court, the probation staff develop a 
</p>
<p>disposition plan which takes into account available support systems and programs, 
</p>
<p>as well as existing assessments conducted on the youth, and may include additional

<p>psychological evaluations or diagnostic tests (Fig.&nbsp;1 shows the stages of delinquency 
</p>
<p>case processing in the juvenile justice system).
</p>
<p>Youth involved in the juvenile justice system experiences a disproportionate 
</p>
<p>prevalence of serious mental health issues, including substance use and depression. 
</p>
<p>Youths with substance use disorders are more likely to continue to offend and are 
</p>
<p>less likely to spend time in employment or attending school (Sickmund &amp; 
</p>
<p>Puzzanchera, 2015). For example, Teplin et&nbsp;al. observed that among juvenile justice- 
</p>
<p>involved youth, two-thirds of males and almost three-quarters of females met 
</p>
<p>diagnostic criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders. Further, half of the males 
</p>
<p>and nearly half of the females had a substance use disorder. Affective disorders were 
</p>
<p>also prevalent, especially among females, 20% of whom met diagnostic criteria for 
</p>
<p>a major depressive episode (Teplin, Abram, McClelland, Dulcan, &amp; Mericle, 2002).
</p>
<p>Youths involved with the juvenile justice system also have a high prevalence of 
</p>
<p>sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., CDC, 2010; Freudenberg, 2009; Hendershot, 
</p>
<p>Magnan, &amp; Bryan, 2010; Schmiege, Levin, Broaddus, &amp; Bryan, 2009; Teplin, 
</p>
<p>Mericle, McClelland, &amp; Abram, 2003). Involvement in sexual risk behaviors and 
</p>
<p>STD acquisition are also associated with depressive symptoms among youth in the 
</p>
<p>general population (e.g., Hallfors et&nbsp;al., 2004; Shrier, Harris, Sternberg, &amp; Beardslee, 
</p>
<p>2001). Similar data for juvenile justice-involved youth is equivocal. Some research 
</p>
<p>has observed relationships between depression and involvement in sexual risk 
</p>
<p>behavior (e.g., Teplin et&nbsp;al., 2005); other studies have identified null findings (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Chen, Stiffman, Cheng, &amp; Dore, 1997).
</p>
<p>Hence, the direction of association between sexual risk behaviors and depressive 
</p>
<p>symptoms remains unclear. For instance, analyses of National Longitudinal Study 
</p>
<p>Fig. 1 Stages of delinquency case processing in the juvenile justice system (Sickmund &amp; 
Puzzanchera, 2015)

</p>
<p>of Adolescent Health data by Hallfors, Waller, Bauer, Ford, and Halpern (2005) 
</p>
<p>indicated engaging in sexual risk behavior and drug use increased the likelihood of 
</p>
<p>future depression among adolescents, especially girls, but depression itself did not 
</p>
<p>predict risky sexual and drug behaviors. In an earlier study using the same data 
</p>
<p>source, however, Shrier et&nbsp;al. (2001) reported depressive symptoms predicted sexual 
</p>
<p>risk behaviors (lack of condom use) and STD infection among boys, but not among 
</p>
<p>girls (see also, Lehrer, Shrier, Gortmaker, &amp; Buka, 2006; Shrier, Harris, &amp; Beardslee, 
</p>
<p>2002). More research is needed to clarify the association between sexual risk 
</p>
<p>behavior and depression.
</p>
<p>Research has also linked marijuana and other drug use with mental health prob-
</p>
<p>lems among adolescents (e.g., Bovasso, 2001; Chen, Wagner, &amp; Anthony, 2002; 
</p>
<p>McGee, Williams, Poulton, &amp; Moffitt, 2000), including depression (Rao, 2006) and 
</p>
<p>other mental disorders (Brook, Zhang, Rubenstone, Primack, &amp; Brook, 2016). For 
</p>
<p>example, in a longitudinal study of adolescents, Horwood et&nbsp; al. (2012) found 
</p>
<p>increased frequency of marijuana use was related to more symptoms of anxiety and 
</p>
<p>depression, with the association declining in adulthood. Patton et&nbsp;al. (2002) also 
</p>
<p>examined longitudinal data on marijuana use and mental health problems from ado-
</p>
<p>lescence into adulthood. Their results indicated the prevalence of depression and 
</p>
<p>anxiety increased with increased use of marijuana, with the effects being most 
</p>
<p>prominent for females; females using cannabis daily had a fivefold greater increase 
</p>
<p>in the odds of experiencing anxiety and depression. Studies of justice-involved 
</p>
<p>youth have also identified comorbidity in marijuana use and depression (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Abram, Teplin, McClelland, &amp; Dulcan, 2003; Stein et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p>Informed by the above reported research, providing sexual disease and related 
</p>
<p>health screening with indicated service follow-up to youth entering the juvenile 
</p>
<p>justice system is urgently needed for several reasons. First, sexually transmitted 
</p>
<p>diseases, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, are asymptomatic and, if left untreated, 
</p>
<p>can have profound adverse medical consequences. Second, most youths following 
</p>
<p>arrest are released back to the community, not placed in secure detention. Statistics 
</p>
<p>indicate approximately 80% of arrested youths are not detained (Snyder &amp; 
</p>
<p>Sickmund, 2006). Arrested youths whose sexual disease infections are not identified 
</p>
<p>and treated are at risk of becoming &ldquo;core transmitters&rdquo; of STDs upon their return to 
</p>
<p>the community (Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2016). Further, urban 
</p>
<p>factors, such as income inequalities, education, and per capita income, also may 
</p>
<p>affect core transmitters adversely since these factors are well-known barriers to 
</p>
<p>treatment and service utilization (Patterson-Lomba, Goldstein, G&oacute;mez-Li&eacute;vano, 
</p>
<p>Castillo-Chavez, &amp; Towers, 2015). Third, it is cost-effective to provide medical 
</p>
<p>treatment to infected youth at the early stages of disease rather than after the diseases 
</p>
<p>have developed into more serious medical conditions.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to describe a case study conducted within an inno-
</p>
<p>vative juvenile assessment facility that examined the relationships among depres-
</p>
<p>sion, age, race/ethnicity, age at first arrest, drug involvement, and sexual behaviors 
</p>
<p>among youth in the criminal justice system. After a thorough discussion of the 
</p>
<p>results, we consider larger service and practice implications.

</p>
<p> Serving Youth Within&nbsp;the Juvenile Justice System: The&nbsp;Juvenile 
</p>
<p>Assessment Center (JAC)
</p>
<p> Brief History of&nbsp;JACs
</p>
<p>Following a 15-month development period involving extensive discussions and col-
</p>
<p>laboration with various community stakeholders, the first JAC was established in 
</p>
<p>Hillsborough County (Tampa), Florida, in 1993 (Dembo &amp; Brown, 1994). Funds for 
</p>
<p>the JAC were obtained via competition from the Drug Abuse Act of 1998 (Byrne 
</p>
<p>Grant) Funds. The Tampa JAC opened its doors to truant youth in January 1993; in 
</p>
<p>May 1993, the JAC began accepting youth arrested on felony, and weapons 
</p>
<p>misdemeanor, charges. In July 1994, the JAC opened its doors to all arrested youth.
</p>
<p>In June 1993, a special session of the Florida Legislature was held to address the 
</p>
<p>issue of prison overcrowding. Prior to this special session, the head of the Florida 
</p>
<p>House of Representatives, Appropriations Committee, visited the Tampa JAC with 
</p>
<p>his wife. Impressed with the center, he was instrumental in including $1.2 million in 
</p>
<p>the special appropriations budget, resulting from this special session, to establish 
</p>
<p>three additional JACs. In 1994, the Florida Legislature established the Florida 
</p>
<p>Department of Juvenile Justice and added an additional $two million to the budget 
</p>
<p>to set up eight more JACs in the state.
</p>
<p>In the mid to late 1990s, word about the Tampa and other Florida JACs (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Orlando, Tallahassee) spread, and several other states expressed an interest in 
</p>
<p>opening similar facilities in their jurisdictions (e.g., Colorado and Kansas). In 
</p>
<p>contrast to Colorado, where JACs were established in a number of different counties, 
</p>
<p>the Kansas Legislature included these programs as part of the Kansas Youth 
</p>
<p>Authority that was established in 1997. Following this early period, JACs spread 
</p>
<p>throughout the United States. In 2003, there were approximately 60 operating JACs 
</p>
<p>in the United States, the last date for which we have these data. Currently, there are 
</p>
<p>18 operating JACs in Florida.
</p>
<p>In 1995, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) 
</p>
<p>became interested in the concept and held a focus group meeting to review the 
</p>
<p>potential of JACs to serve at-risk youth around the United States. The Florida 
</p>
<p>experience was an important component of this discussion. Although positive about 
</p>
<p>the JAC concept, the group expressed concern over their &ldquo;net widening&rdquo; potential, 
</p>
<p>overrepresentation of minorities, and the limited knowledge about the level and type 
</p>
<p>of community support needed for JACs to succeed (OJJDP, 1995; Oldenettel &amp; 
</p>
<p>Wordes, 2000). In response to these issues, OJJDP sponsored a fact-finding study 
</p>
<p>conducted by Roberta Cronin. Ms. Cronin&rsquo;s effort involved visiting a number of 
</p>
<p>JACs as well as a mail survey of juvenile justice and youth service personnel 
</p>
<p>nationally and extensive telephone networking (Cronin, 1996).
</p>
<p>Based on the results of Cronin&rsquo;s inquiry (1996), OJJDP established a Community 
</p>
<p>Assessment Center (CAC) initiative in 1996 to explore the usefulness of the concept. 
</p>
<p>The CAC demonstration effort involved funding several communities. Denver, 
</p>
<p>Colorado, and Lee County, Florida, were designated &ldquo;planning sites&rdquo; and received 
</p>
<p>R. Dembo et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>167
</p>
<p>funds to develop new CACs. Jefferson County, Colorado, and Orlando, Florida, 
</p>
<p>were designated &ldquo;enhancement sites,&rdquo; in which funds were to be used to improve 
</p>
<p>their current assessment centers.
</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) also 
</p>
<p>became interested in JACs as an effective approach to intervene with juvenile 
</p>
<p>offenders with drug abuse problems. CSAT commissioned James Rivers to complete 
</p>
<p>a report on JACs. Rivers (1997) visited five JACs: (1) Orlando, Florida; (2) 
</p>
<p>Tallahassee, Florida; (3) Tampa, Florida; (4) Golden, Colorado; and (5) Olathe, 
</p>
<p>Kansas (serving Orlando, Leon, Hillsborough, Jefferson, and Johnson Counties, 
</p>
<p>respectively). He also reviewed available reports and statistics. In his report, Rivers 
</p>
<p>concluded that funding JACs could make a contribution to the mission of CSAT, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the area of knowledge development.
</p>
<p> Key Elements of&nbsp;JACs
</p>
<p>Although JACs may differ in a number of ways (e.g., organizational structures, 
</p>
<p>staffing patterns, operating schedules), they generally share a number of common 
</p>
<p>elements (also see Oldenettel &amp; Wordes, 2000):
</p>
<p> 1. Single point of entry: There is a 24-h centralized point of intake and screening 
</p>
<p>for juveniles who have come or are likely to come into contact with the juvenile 
</p>
<p>justice system.
</p>
<p> 2. Immediate and comprehensive screening: Service providers associated with the 
</p>
<p>JAC make an initial broad-based screening, followed, if necessary, by a later, 
</p>
<p>in-depth assessment of youths&rsquo; circumstances and treatment needs.
</p>
<p> 3. Management information systems: Needed to manage and monitor youth, they 
</p>
<p>help to ensure the provision of appropriate treatment services and to avoid the 
</p>
<p>duplication of services.
</p>
<p> 4. Integrated case management services: JAC staff use information obtained from 
</p>
<p>the screening process, and the management information systems, to develop 
</p>
<p>recommendations to improve access to services, to complete follow-ups of 
</p>
<p>referred youth, and to periodically reassess youth placed in various services.
</p>
<p> Health Coach Services
</p>
<p>The Health Coach service is housed at a JAC located in a southeastern US city, 
</p>
<p>where all arrested youth are brought for justice system processing, psychosocial 
</p>
<p>screening, and determination of release status (e.g., secure detention, home arrest, 
</p>
<p>recommended for placement in a diversion program) (Dembo, DiClemente, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Brown, 2015). The JAC meets statutory requirements, as well as identifies and 
</p>
<p>responds to the results of psychosocial screening indicating a need for follow-up 
</p>
<p>evaluation and services (Dembo &amp; Brown, 1994; Dembo &amp; Walters, 2012).

</p>
<p>Health Coaches are Department of Health (DOH)-trained, undergraduate degree 
</p>
<p>holders working under the direction of a project manager. Health Coaches are 
</p>
<p>selected based on their ability to interact with youth and to nonjudgmentally discuss 
</p>
<p>sexual behavior issues. They are on duty 11&nbsp;a.m. to midnight, Monday to Friday, 
</p>
<p>during which period most youths enter the JAC and are on call on weekends to serve 
</p>
<p>JAC-processed youth.
</p>
<p>County Sheriff Office detention deputies operate the secure wing at the JAC.&nbsp;In 
</p>
<p>addition to providing for facility security, deputies complete a booking process for 
</p>
<p>each youth that occurs immediately after youth enter the JAC secure wing, which 
</p>
<p>includes the collection of basic demographic and contact information (e.g., address), 
</p>
<p>electronic fingerprints, and a photograph. After this required process, each youth is 
</p>
<p>approached by a Health Coach and invited to participate in the new service.
</p>
<p>Each youth is informed the Health Coach service will involve the following 
</p>
<p>information gathering and service activities: (1) sociodemographic (e.g., age, living 
</p>
<p>arrangement); (2) alcohol and other substance use (Texas Christian University Drug 
</p>
<p>Screen V (Institute of Behavioral Research, 2014)) as well as collecting a urine 
</p>
<p>specimen for substance use analysis; (3) split testing of the urine specimen for STD 
</p>
<p>testing (i.e., chlamydia and gonorrhea) with free confidential follow-up treatment 
</p>
<p>by the DOH if indicated; (4) screening for HIV, with follow-up, DOH confirmatory 
</p>
<p>testing and treatment; (5) completion of a screen to identify a need for hepatitis C 
</p>
<p>testing and treatment of all positive youth is available; (6) sexual behavior; (7) 
</p>
<p>depression (Melchior, Huba, Brown, &amp; Reback, 1993); (8) linking youth with a 
</p>
<p>primary healthcare physician, if they do not have one, at a local family healthcare 
</p>
<p>center; (9) completion of an online sexually transmitted disease risk-reduction 
</p>
<p>intervention; (10) follow-up phone calls by Health Coaches to monitor their health 
</p>
<p>behavior and need for additional services; and (11) randomly selected youth will 
</p>
<p>receive a 6-month follow-up assessment. Youths testing positive for any drug or 
</p>
<p>with an elevated depression score (7+) are promptly referred to an on-site therapist 
</p>
<p>for follow-up care. Each participating youth is informed he/she will be eligible for 
</p>
<p>one of five $100 gift cards to be determined before Christmas each year.
</p>
<p>Male and female youths interested in receiving Health Coach services complete 
</p>
<p>a consent form and receive Health Coach pre-counseling. The DOH has trained the 
</p>
<p>Health Coaches to administer health department standard pre- and post-counseling 
</p>
<p>to youth, as well as follow other department protocols, such as post-JAC contact 
</p>
<p>procedures.
</p>
<p> STD Risk-Reduction Interventions
</p>
<p>Gender-specific interventions are planned for use among youth receiving Health 
</p>
<p>Coach services. Intervention videos are in multimedia, digital format. The female 
</p>
<p>video, Horizons, based on social cognitive theory and the theory of gender and 
</p>
<p>power, is a CDC evidence-based intervention designed to reduce sexually transmitted 
</p>
<p>diseases (STDs), increase condom use, increase communication with male partners 
</p>

</p>
<p>about safer sex and STDs, and increase male partners accessing STD services 
</p>
<p>(DiClemente et&nbsp;al., 2009). Initially developed for use among heterosexually active 
</p>
<p>African American adolescent girls, it has been adapted for use among diverse 
</p>
<p>cultural groups of girls. The male STD risk-reduction intervention video, designed 
</p>
<p>for use among diverse cultural groups, is currently in development. It is based on 
</p>
<p>information collected in focus group discussions with behavioral health agency 
</p>
<p>clients in treatment. A shortened version of each intervention video is planned for 
</p>
<p>viewing on laptops while the youth is at the JAC, with a full-length version of the 
</p>
<p>video being accessible via the Internet following release.
</p>
<p> Community Collaborating Agencies
</p>
<p>Collaborating community-based family health centers are key partners in this new 
</p>
<p>service system. The Tampa Family Health Centers receive referrals from the DOH 
</p>
<p>and JAC-based Health Coaches. Health Coach referrals are made to a designated 
</p>
<p>family health center staff member, who contacts the youth and assigns her/him to a 
</p>
<p>health center near their home. (The Tampa Family Health Centers are federally 
</p>
<p>recognized and funded to provide services to low-income families.)
</p>
<p> Health Coach Service MIS
</p>
<p>Referral, treatment engagement), retention, and service outcome (e.g., treatment 
</p>
<p>received) information are shared with the Health Coaches for inclusion in a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive medical information system (MIS established for this new service, 
</p>
<p>which includes the information described earlier. With the routine collection of 
</p>
<p>individual data (e.g., drug use, STD and HIV status) and community-level data 
</p>
<p>(e.g., increases in medical services delivered to youth in family health centers 
</p>
<p>located in zip codes where JAC-processed Health Coach youths are heavily 
</p>
<p>concentrated), the MIS will permit the study of multilevel outcomes).
</p>
<p> Case Study
</p>
<p>This case study involving arrested youth entering JAC Health Coach services 
</p>
<p>explored the relationship between depression and age, race/ethnicity, age at first 
</p>
<p>arrest, reported past year drug involvement, reported number of sexual partners, and 
</p>
<p>biological data on the youth&rsquo;s marijuana use and sexually transmitted diseases 
</p>
<p>(chlamydia and gonorrhea). Based on previous research (Dembo, Belenko, Childs, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Wareham, 2009), it was expected that (1) female youth level of depression would 
</p>
<p>be higher, than that of males; (2) female rates of sexually transmitted diseases would 
</p>
<p>Multi-Group Study of Justice Involved Youth</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>170
</p>
<p>be greater than that of male youth; and (3) male and female youth would experience 
</p>
<p>multiple, overlapping behavioral health issues, with females being more affected by 
</p>
<p>these issues than males. Following a psychometric assessment of the depression 
</p>
<p>measure across the male and female youth groups, a cross gender, multigroup 
</p>
<p>regression analysis was performed to examine these empirical expectations.
</p>
<p> Project Setting: JAC Health Coach Service
</p>
<p>The Health Coach data used in this study were collected in the innovative, compre-
</p>
<p>hensive health service for youth entering the JAC, described earlier. Given the dis-
</p>
<p>proportionate risk of STD and HIV among girls (CDC, 2013, 2015; Dembo et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2009), Health Coach services initially focused on this gender group. However, on 
</p>
<p>February 4, 2016, the service was expanded to include boys. Participation in the 
</p>
<p>service is voluntary. The data were routinely collected by Health Coaches from the 
</p>
<p>youth clients they served. The Health Coaches were trained to follow a data 
</p>
<p>collection and service delivery protocol, and their data entry was monitored for 
</p>
<p>integrity and quality by the program manager (a co-author of this paper).
</p>
<p>Following informed consent, 241 females and 102 males received Health Coach 
</p>
<p>services from October 19, 2015 (project implementation date), through March 21, 
</p>
<p>2016 (Florida Public Health law does not require youth 12&nbsp;years and over to obtain 
</p>
<p>parental consent for STD or HIV testing or treatment). Among male and female 
</p>
<p>youth approached to participate in this voluntary service, 57% of males and 75% of 
</p>
<p>females agreed. Sociodemographic information (age, race/ethnicity), and data on 
</p>
<p>age at first arrest, and post-JAC placement (secure detention, home detention, 
</p>
<p>outright release) were available for all youth declining Health Coach services. 
</p>
<p>Comparison of youth participating or declining to participate in Health Coach 
</p>
<p>services identified only one significant difference between them: participating youth 
</p>
<p>were slightly older than nonparticipating youth (15.5 vs 15.8, respectively, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). 
</p>
<p>(Due to space concerns, detailed results are not presented. A copy of the results can 
</p>
<p>be obtained from the senior author upon request.)
</p>
<p> Measures
</p>
<p>The data the authors collected came from a number of sources and were important 
</p>
<p>in understanding empirical and correlational relationships among the youth being 
</p>
<p>served in the JAC and the factors (e.g., sociodemographic, drug use, at-risk sexual 
</p>
<p>behaviors, and depression) that may contribute to their current involvement with the 
</p>
<p>juvenile justice system. As shown in the literature, low rates of engagement in 
</p>
<p>mental health services are found for juveniles subsequent to their first contact with 
</p>
<p>juvenile justice (Burke, Mulvey, &amp; Schubert, 2015).

</p>
<p> SocioDemographic Characteristics
</p>
<p>Several demographic characteristics on the youth were used in this study: (1) age (in 
</p>
<p>number of years), (2) gender (0&nbsp;=&nbsp;male; 1&nbsp;=&nbsp;female), and (3) information on the 
</p>
<p>youths&rsquo; race/ethnicity (described in more detail in the results section) which was 
</p>
<p>coded as race (1&nbsp;=&nbsp;African American; 0&nbsp;=&nbsp;other race) and ethnicity (1&nbsp;=&nbsp;Hispanic; 
</p>
<p>0&nbsp;=&nbsp;non-Hispanic).
</p>
<p> Age at First Arrest
</p>
<p>Drawing on the literature indicating early contact with law enforcement resulting in 
</p>
<p>arrest is associated with long-term problem behavior outcomes (Farrington &amp; 
</p>
<p>Hawkins, 1991; Farrington, Ttofi, &amp; Coid, 2009; Moffitt, 1993), we included a 
</p>
<p>measure of age of first arrest for the youths in this case study. These data were 
</p>
<p>obtained from official records.
</p>
<p> Drug Use
</p>
<p>Measuring drug use using self-report and drug screen measures allows us to appro-
</p>
<p>priately estimate the amount of use by the youth electing to participate in the Health 
</p>
<p>Coach program. Geared to DSM-V criteria, the TCUDS V (TCU Drug Screen V) 
</p>
<p>(TCU Institute of Behavioral Research, 2014) is a detailed, self-report instrument 
</p>
<p>probing use of various drugs and consequences of use during the 12&nbsp;months prior to 
</p>
<p>JAC entry. Responses to this instrument are scored to produce a single total score 
</p>
<p>ranging from 0 to 11, which is, then, converted to three severity categories 
</p>
<p>corresponding to DSM-5 criteria: 1&nbsp;=&nbsp;mild disorder, score of 2&ndash;3 points (presence 
</p>
<p>of 2&ndash;3 symptoms); 2&nbsp;=&nbsp;moderate disorder, score of 4&ndash;5 points (presence of 4&ndash;5 
</p>
<p>symptoms); and 3&nbsp;=&nbsp;severe disorder, score of 6 or more points (presence of 6 or 
</p>
<p>more symptoms). In addition, we added another &ldquo;severity&rdquo; category, corresponding 
</p>
<p>to the presence of fewer than 2 points: 0&nbsp;=&nbsp;no disorder.
</p>
<p>Youth also agreed to drug screens. At the DOH testing lab, the urine specimens 
</p>
<p>were split with half the specimen being tested for the following seven drugs using 
</p>
<p>the EMIT procedure: (1) methamphetamines, (2) cocaine, (3) opiates, (4) marijuana, 
</p>
<p>(5) spice (UR144 metabolite), (6) alcohol (4&nbsp;days use), and (7) benzodiazepines. 
</p>
<p>Few youths were found to be drug positive for any drug other than marijuana (range 
</p>
<p>0% to 3%); hence, these drugs were excluded from further analysis. The cutoff level 
</p>
<p>for a positive for marijuana is 50&nbsp;ng/ml of urine. The UA results for marijuana were 
</p>
<p>dichotomized (0&nbsp;=&nbsp;negative, 1&nbsp;=&nbsp;positive) for analysis.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>172
</p>
<p> STD Status
</p>
<p>A noninvasive, FDA-approved, urine-based nucleic acid test, Gen-Probe APTIMA 
</p>
<p>Combo 2 Assay, was used to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea in the second half of 
</p>
<p>the split urine specimen. The sensitivity of Gen-Probe&rsquo;s test has been shown to be 
</p>
<p>superior to culture and direct specimen tests. For chlamydia, the sensitivity and 
</p>
<p>specificity of the Gen-Probe urine-based test are 95.9% and 98.2%, respectively, 
</p>
<p>and for gonorrhea, they are 97.8% and 98.9%, respectively (Chacko, Barnes, 
</p>
<p>Wiemann, &amp; DiClemente, 2004). For analysis purposes, each youth&rsquo;s STD results 
</p>
<p>were recoded into a dichotomous variable representing positive (coded as 1) for any 
</p>
<p>STD (i.e., chlamydia, gonorrhea, or both) or negative (coded as 0) for both STDs. 
</p>
<p>While a more detailed breakdown of the youth&rsquo;s specific STDs is given in the results 
</p>
<p>section, it is important to note that Florida STD rates are quite high among male and 
</p>
<p>female youth. Florida DOH data indicate males aged 10&ndash;19 accounted for 17% of 
</p>
<p>all male recorded STDs and females aged 10&ndash;19 accounted for 33% of all female 
</p>
<p>STDs, in 2012 (the latest year for which these data are available; www.floridahealth.
</p>
<p>gov accessed April 14, 2016).
</p>
<p> Lifetime Number of&nbsp;Sexual Partners
</p>
<p>Number of sexual partners is widely used as a sexual risk behavior measure (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Komro, Tobler, Maldonado-Molina, &amp; Perry, 2010). We selected a question from 
</p>
<p>the high school version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Youth 
</p>
<p>Risk Behavior Survey (2015), to measure the youths&rsquo; number of sexual partners. 
</p>
<p>The question asked of each youth was: During your life, with how many people 
</p>
<p>have you had sexual intercourse? Response choices were the following: A.&nbsp;I have 
</p>
<p>never had sexual intercourse; B. 1 person; C. 2 people; D. 3 people; E. 4 people; F. 
</p>
<p>5 people; or G. 6 or more people.
</p>
<p> Depression
</p>
<p>We used the 8-item, shortened version of the widely used 20-item Center for 
</p>
<p>Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977). The 8-item 
</p>
<p>measure resulted from the psychometric work of Melchior et&nbsp;al. (1993), in which 
</p>
<p>they found the 8-item CES-D correlated 0.93 with the full 20-item CES-D.&nbsp;The 
</p>
<p>following items were used: &lsquo;(1) I felt I could not shake off the blues even with the 
</p>
<p>help from my family and friends; (2) I felt sad; (3) I felt depressed; (4) I thought my 
</p>
<p>life had been a failure; (5) I felt fearful; (6) My sleep was restless; (7) I felt lonely; 
</p>
<p>and (8) I had crying spells (time frames, the past week). Each item was scored as 
</p>
<p>follows: 0&nbsp;=&nbsp;less than 1&nbsp;day, 1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&ndash;2&nbsp;days, 2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&ndash;4&nbsp;days, and 3&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&ndash;7&nbsp;days. Although

</p>
<p>the 8-item measure was originally developed among a community sample of 
</p>
<p>women, we wished to assess its usefulness among female and male youth receiving 
</p>
<p>Health Coach services.
</p>
<p> Data Analysis
</p>
<p>The analyses proceeded in several stages. First, descriptive comparisons were made 
</p>
<p>between male and female youth on the variables analyzed in this study. Second, a 
</p>
<p>confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed in the depression items to 
</p>
<p>determine if their psychometric properties were the same for both gender groups. 
</p>
<p>Third, a regression analysis was completed to determine the significant predictors of 
</p>
<p>the male and female youths&rsquo; depression involving the above discussed variables. 
</p>
<p>Steps 2 and 3 involved multigroup analysis.
</p>
<p>Since we have complete data in the depression measure for the youths, missing 
</p>
<p>data on the predictor variables can be considered as missing at random (Enders, 
</p>
<p>2010). The depression CFA and regression analyses were performed using Mplus 
</p>
<p>Version 7.4 (Muth&egrave;n &amp; Muth&egrave;n, 1998&ndash;2012).
</p>
<p> Results
</p>
<p> Descriptive Statistics and&nbsp;Variable Comparisons Across&nbsp;Gender 
</p>
<p>Groups
</p>
<p>Most of the youths were female (70%). Female youth averaged 15.2 (SD&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.46), 
</p>
<p>and the males averaged 16.1 (SD&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.85) years in age. This difference was, in part, 
</p>
<p>a consequence of the decision to provide Health Coach services to older adolescent 
</p>
<p>males, aged 15&ndash;17, who are at greater risk of contracting sexually transmitted 
</p>
<p>diseases (CDC, 2012, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c), than younger males. The youth were 
</p>
<p>racially and ethnically diverse. A majority of male (69.9%) and female (52.3%) 
</p>
<p>youth were African American, but sizable percentages of Hispanic and Anglo youth 
</p>
<p>are represented in the study, as Table&nbsp;1 shows.
</p>
<p>Age at first arrest was similar for the male and female youth. The average age 
</p>
<p>was 14&nbsp;years for each gender group.
</p>
<p>The TCU drug screen results indicated most males (87%) and females (78%) 
</p>
<p>were in the no drug use group. However, more females than males were in the mild 
</p>
<p>and moderate severity groups. Similar percentages of both gender groups were in 
</p>
<p>the severe drug use category.
</p>
<p>As noted earlier, few youths were UA positive for methamphetamines, cocaine, 
</p>
<p>opiates, spice (UR144 metabolite), alcohol, or benzodiazepines. However, among 
</p>
<p>tested male and female youth, 74% of the males and 36% of the females were drug 
</p>
<p>positive for marijuana.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>174
</p>
<p>In regard to STD status, 15% of females and 8% of males were positive for chla-
</p>
<p>mydia or gonorrhea or both STDs. The prevalence of chlamydia among females 
</p>
<p>(11.8%) was nearly double that for males (6.2%). The observed STD prevalence is 
</p>
<p>markedly higher than found among youth aged 10&ndash;19&nbsp;in the general Hillsborough 
</p>
<p>County population. In 2014, for example, 1.8% of females, compared to 0.4% of 
</p>
<p>males, were diagnosed with chlamydia; and 0.2% of females, versus 0.1% of males, 
</p>
<p>were diagnosed with gonorrhea (Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough 
</p>
<p>County, private communication on 4/11/2016).
</p>
<p>Number of sexual partners also differed between the two gender groups. Females 
</p>
<p>reported 1.77 lifetime partners compared to 3.99 partners for males, with 43% of the 
</p>
<p>males, compared to 8% of the females, reporting 6+ lifetime sexual partners. Thirty- 
</p>
<p>five percent of the females, versus 7% of the males, reported no sexual partners. 
</p>
<p>Comparison of these results with findings reported in the Centers for Disease 
</p>
<p>Control and Prevention&rsquo;s 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System ([YRBSS] 
</p>
<p>CDC, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c) indicates a much higher rate of ever having had sexual 
</p>
<p>intercourse among youths in the present study (73%), than that reported by youths 
</p>
<p>in the YRBSS nationally (47%) or in Florida (overall, 44%).

</p>
<p>Many youth reported depressive symptomatology. Overall, females had a CES-D 
</p>
<p>summary score of 5.20, compared to 2.81 for the males (F&nbsp; =&nbsp; 11.14, df&nbsp; =&nbsp; 1341, 
</p>
<p>p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001). Importantly, 31% of females, versus 15% of males, had a depression 
</p>
<p>score of seven or higher (the designated threshold score), a level indicative of 
</p>
<p>potentially needing clinical intervention (Brown et&nbsp; al., 2014; Santor &amp; Coyne,

</p>
<p> Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Depression Items

<p>A multigroup, male-female, one-factor CFA involving Mplus version 7.4 (Muth&egrave;n

<p> Predictors of&nbsp;Depression Among Female and&nbsp;Male Youth
</p>
<p>Among males, sparse numbers of cases in some predictor variable cells (e.g., 7 with 
</p>
<p>STD-positive results), as well as missing data on predictor variables, precluded 
</p>
<p>meaningful multigroup regression model analysis using Bayesian or WLSMV 
</p>
<p>estimation. Instead, we decided to use an overall measure of depression, involving 
</p>
<p>the sum of responses across the eight items. The scores ranged from 0 to 24. The 
</p>
<p>overall, summed measure had acceptable skewness (1.32) and kurtosis values 
</p>
<p>(0.619) (Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &amp; Strahan, 1999). Further, the summed 
</p>
<p>depression measure was highly correlated with the depression latent variable 
</p>
<p>resulting from the CFA of the eight items (r&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.905).
</p>
<p>The results of the multigroup (gender) regression analysis are presented in 
</p>
<p>Table&nbsp;2. For males a significant positive relationship was observed between age and 
</p>
<p>depression, and a significant negative relationship was found between number of 
</p>
<p>sexual partners and depression. Among females, significant positive relationships 
</p>
<p>were found between TCU level of drug use severity, and number of reported sexual 
</p>
<p>partners, and depression.

<p> Discussion
</p>
<p>This case study examined the relationship between depression and age, race/ethnic-
</p>
<p>ity, age at first arrest, severity of reported past year drug involvement, reported num-
</p>
<p>ber of sexual partners, and biological data on the youth&rsquo;s marijuana use and sexually 
</p>
<p>transmitted diseases (chlamydia and gonorrhea). The case study and data analyses 
</p>
<p>were informed by several research questions. Question 1, female youth level of 
</p>
<p>depression would be higher than that of males. Prior to answering this question, the 
</p>
<p>authors conduced CFA analyses to assess if the depression measures were invariant 
</p>
<p>across the male and female youth. The authors found the eight-item depression 
</p>
<p>measure was partially invariant across the gender groups. Based on these results, the 
</p>
<p>authors compared the mean depression scores across the gender groups and found, 
</p>
<p>consistent with previous studies on depression among youth, that females had sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly higher depression scores than the males (e.g., Lehrer et&nbsp;al., 2006; Shrier 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2001, 2002). In addition, a significantly larger percent of females, than males, 
</p>
<p>had an CES-D summary score above the threshold of seven.
</p>
<p>Question 2, informing this case study related to our expectation, based on the 
</p>
<p>research reported earlier, that the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases would 
</p>
<p>R. Dembo et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>177
</p>
<p>be higher among females than males. This was the case, with the prevalence of STD 
</p>
<p>among females (15%) being almost twice that observed among males (8%).
</p>
<p>Our third expectation, reflected in research question 3, was that male and female 
</p>
<p>youth would experience multiple, overlapping behavioral health issues, with females 
</p>
<p>being more impacted by these issues. To address this question, we conducted a cross 
</p>
<p>gender, multigroup maximum likelihood regression analysis. The results of the 
</p>
<p>regression analysis highlighted, among male youth, a significant positive relation-
</p>
<p>ship between age and depression and a significant negative relationship between 
</p>
<p>reported number of sexual partners and depression.
</p>
<p>In contrast, among females (1) a significant negative relationship was found 
</p>
<p>between depression and being African American, and (2) significant positive rela-
</p>
<p>tionships were found between reported number of sexual partners and depression 
</p>
<p>and between TCU drug involvement level and depression, with females having 
</p>
<p>more serious levels of drug involvement reporting a higher level of depression. 
</p>
<p>These results provide evidence of behavioral health differences between the two 
</p>
<p>gender groups and highlight that females are more adversely impacted. In particular, 
</p>
<p>a larger number of sexual partners among males seem to enhance their sense of 
</p>
<p>well-being, while the opposite is the case among females.
</p>
<p>Another interesting finding in our analysis is that females who are non-African 
</p>
<p>American (mainly Anglo) have higher depression scores, than African American 
</p>
<p>girls. This finding can, perhaps, be explained by the concept of relative deviance 
</p>
<p>(Dembo &amp; Shern, 1982). According to this view, youths who are &ldquo;deviant&rdquo; from the 
</p>
<p>norms of their social and cultural setting are more likely to be involved in problem 
</p>
<p>behavior than youths who follow these norms. Since Anglo youth are less likely to 
</p>
<p>enter the juvenile justice system, those that do are more likely to be experiencing 
</p>
<p>emotional/psychological issues. Future research should explore this relationship, 
</p>
<p>particularly among other at-risk racial/ethnic populations.
</p>
<p>Our results highlight that screening for depression at intake into the juvenile 
</p>
<p>justice system is important, especially among females. Youth with elevated 
</p>
<p>depression should be linked promptly with additional evaluative and clinical 
</p>
<p>services. This is an ongoing component of the Health Coach service, with all youth 
</p>
<p>having depression scores of seven or higher being referred to an on-site therapist for 
</p>
<p>further evaluation. Relatedly, intervention programs should be aware of possible 
</p>
<p>differential gender group effects of drug use and having multiple sexual partners on 
</p>
<p>youth depression.
</p>
<p>A particular strength of the Health Coach project is its use of biological markers 
</p>
<p>to assess STDs and drug use. Studies on the topic of this chapter among justice- 
</p>
<p>involved youth often rely on self-report data, which often reflect social desirability 
</p>
<p>biases yielding systematic underreporting (Dembo et&nbsp;al., 1999).
</p>
<p>There are several limitations to our research. First, it is important to note that the 
</p>
<p>regression analysis was conducted on cross-sectional data. Hence, no causal 
</p>
<p>interpretations of our findings are possible. Second, the results of the study may not 
</p>
<p>generalize to male and female youth arrested in other jurisdictions, reflecting 
</p>
<p>different sociodemographic circumstances. Third, the data on number of sexual 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>178
</p>
<p>partners and depression, although reflecting relationships that are consistent with 
</p>
<p>other studies noted earlier, were based on self-reports.
</p>
<p>The results of this case study indicate there is a crucial need to provide quality 
</p>
<p>behavioral health and public health screening assessment of youth entering the 
</p>
<p>justice system, with special attention to females who bear a greater burden of these 
</p>
<p>problems. Implementing interventions targeting substance use, depression, and 
</p>
<p>sexual risk behavior is needed to help these youths, who often lack access to quality 
</p>
<p>health services, engage in healthier behavior and avoid adverse outcomes such as 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS.
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>This case study results document the serious need for front-end, juvenile justice 
</p>
<p>intake facilities to provide behavioral and public health screening and treatment 
</p>
<p>follow-up on newly arrested youth. These youths represent the high-risk end of the 
</p>
<p>community, and most arrested youths are soon returned to the community (in our 
</p>
<p>case study, 70% were placed on nonsecure home detention or released outright). 
</p>
<p>This service need is reflected, for example, in the high urine tested prevalence rate 
</p>
<p>for marijuana, the high STD prevalence rates, and the high level of depression 
</p>
<p>among these youths.
</p>
<p>The authors found gender differences in behavioral health and public health 
</p>
<p>needs among the youth. Female youth had a higher prevalence rates for STDs, than 
</p>
<p>males. A higher percentage of males tested positive for recent marijuana use than 
</p>
<p>females. Further, higher percentage of females scored 7+ on our evidence-based 
</p>
<p>depression measure, than the males. And, as discussed earlier, multigroup regression 
</p>
<p>analysis highlighted male and female youth experience multiple, overlapping 
</p>
<p>behavioral health issues, with females being more impacted by these issues.
</p>
<p>JACs, or similar centralized intake facilities, are ideal places to conduct these 
</p>
<p>screening and service linkage activities. They can serve as a critical community 
</p>
<p>resource to identify and respond to the service needs of arrested youth, whose 
</p>
<p>families often lack the resources to access these services on their own.
</p>
<p> Vision for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Future
</p>
<p>The authors plan to continue current efforts to serve as a public health monitoring 
</p>
<p>station. Our efforts include (1) collaboration with the University of Maryland&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Community Drug Early Warning System project to identify new drugs of abuse and 
</p>
<p>include testing for new metabolites in our UA testing protocol, as the authors have 
</p>
<p>done for the synthetic spice metabolite UR-144 (Wish, Billing, &amp; Artigiani, 2015) 
</p>
<p>and (2) collaboration with other scientists to identify, test, and evaluate the efficacy 
</p>
<p>and feasibility of collecting microbiological markers to assess depression.

<p>The authors are currently working with other jurisdictions in Florida to expand 
</p>
<p>the Health Coach service model the authors have implemented; hopefully, out-of- 
</p>
<p>state jurisdictions will be interested in adopting this service as well. The authors 
</p>
<p>plan to provide training and implementation support to requesting jurisdictions, so 
</p>
<p>they can better identify and address the behavioral and public health needs of 
</p>
<p>justice-involved youth.

</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Historically, teaching and research are structured around specific disciplines, each 
</p>
<p>with its own nomenclature, conceptual approaches, literature base, target audiences, 
</p>
<p>and application strategies. However, thus far, outside the field of public health, mini-
</p>
<p>mal efforts have been devoted to an interdisciplinary approach to solving health- care 
</p>
<p>problems. One of the core concepts underlining a public health approach or perspec-
</p>
<p>tive is a focus on the health of an entire population. Accordingly, a public health 
</p>
<p>approach involves an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention through-
</p>
<p>out the lifespan. It takes into consideration an interdisciplinary framework for exam-
</p>
<p>ining both physical and behavioral health problems. The World Health Organization 
</p>
<p>suggests a public health approach should include the following four steps:
</p>
<p> 1. &ldquo;Surveillance: To define the problem through the systematic collection of information about the 
</p>
<p>magnitude, scope, characteristics and consequences of the problem.
</p>
<p> 2. Identify risk and protective factors: To establish what the problem is and why it occurs using 
</p>
<p>research to determine the causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of, 
</p>
<p>and the factors that could be modified through interventions.
</p>
<p> 3. Develop and evaluate interventions: To find out what works to prevent the health issue by 
</p>
<p>designing, implementing and evaluating interventions.

<p> 4. Implementation: To implement effective and promising interventions in a wide range of set-
</p>
<p>tings. The effects of these interventions on risk factors and the target outcome should be 
</p>
<p> monitored, and their impact and cost-effectiveness should be evaluated.&rdquo; (Violence Prevention 
</p>
<p>Alliance, 2018, p.&nbsp;11).
</p>
<p>Hence, we suggest that a public health framework that encompasses an interdis-
</p>
<p>ciplinary approach to behavioral disorders and emphasizes opportunities for pre-
</p>
<p>vention, early detection, and intervention will be more likely to reduce the burden 
</p>
<p>of both physical and behavioral health illnesses (Becker, Levin, &amp; Hanson, 2010). 
</p>
<p>Since a public health approach is population-based, it encompasses important 
</p>
<p>social, cultural, economic, and environmental factors that affect women&rsquo;s health.
</p>
<p>This chapter examines critical issues in women&rsquo;s behavioral health from an inter-
</p>
<p>disciplinary public health perspective. The content focuses on the essential elements 
</p>
<p>of a public health perspective and discusses some of the major concerns in improving 
</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s health outcomes. This chapter has two objectives: (1) to discuss behavioral 
</p>
<p>health (alcohol, drug abuse, and mental) problems of concern to women and (2) to 
</p>
<p>review services delivery and services research issues related to women&rsquo;s behavioral 
</p>
<p>health. We also include a discussion of current challenges in prevention and treat-
</p>
<p>ment for three selected areas: (1) HIV; (2) postpartum depression; and (3) trauma-
</p>
<p>informed care, which are significant public health concerns. The chapter concludes 
</p>
<p>with an Implications for Behavioral Health section, discussing the relevance of each 
</p>
<p>issue to the overall field of women&rsquo;s behavioral health and health-care policy.
</p>
<p>The material in this chapter is particularly timely in that it provides new informa-
</p>
<p>tion from current research findings and discusses important reimbursement policy 
</p>
<p>and service delivery challenges that must be addressed if women&rsquo;s health-care out-
</p>
<p>comes are to be improved. The chapter is also very comprehensive. Among other 
</p>
<p>things, in addition to the major topics mentioned above, it includes a discussion of 
</p>
<p>the global burden of disease, health disparities, comorbidity, trauma-informed ser-
</p>
<p>vices, and health literacy. In addition to examination of the relevant issues in wom-
</p>
<p>en&rsquo;s mental health, this chapter emphasizes the importance of maintaining a public 
</p>
<p>health perspective and using an interdisciplinary approach for the study of women&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>behavioral health. An interdisciplinary public health approach is preferred because 
</p>
<p>it will encourage individuals from diverse disciplines to work together in future 
</p>
<p>research to improve health-care outcomes for women.
</p>
<p> Epidemiology
</p>
<p>Behavioral health problems, which include mental health and substance use disor-
</p>
<p>ders, are major contributors to the global burden of disease. Worldwide, approxi-
</p>
<p>mately 450 million people live with a behavioral disorder (GBD 2016 DALYs and 
</p>
<p>HALE Collaborators, 2017). In developing countries, behavioral disorders are sec-
</p>
<p>ond only to cardiovascular diseases in contributing to lost years of life (World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization, 2017). Although behavioral disorders have a serious impact 
</p>
<p>upon all individuals, it is important to recognize gender differences in the rates, 
</p>
<p>experience, and course of these disorders. For example, women are twice as likely 
</p>

</p>
<p>as men to suffer from major depression and rates of anxiety disorders, including 
</p>
<p>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which are two to three times higher in 
</p>
<p>women compared to men (Kessler, Berglund, et&nbsp; al., 2005; Office on Women&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Health, 2009). Women also are at greater risk of poor self-care and poor adherence 
</p>
<p>to treat (Rapaport, Clary, Fayyad, &amp; Endicott, 2005).
</p>
<p>To explore gender differences in health, researchers (Pratt &amp; Brody, 2014) ana-
</p>
<p>lyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 
</p>
<p>which is a continuous cross-sectional survey of the civilian, non-institutionalized 
</p>
<p>US population, designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans. Not only 
</p>
<p>did females have higher rates of depression than males in every age group; the rate 
</p>
<p>of depression increased by age, from 5.7% among girls aged 12&ndash;17 to 9.8% among 
</p>
<p>women aged 40&ndash;59. Women aged 40&ndash;59 also had the highest rate of depression 
</p>
<p>(12.3%) among all age groups and gender. The lowest rates of depression were for 
</p>
<p>males aged 12&ndash;17 (4.0%) and for males 60 and over (3.4%). Nearly 90% of persons 
</p>
<p>with depressive symptoms reported difficulty with work, home, or social activities. 
</p>
<p>Just one-third of persons with severe depressive symptoms sought care from a 
</p>
<p>behavioral health professional (Pratt &amp; Brody, 2014).
</p>
<p>Women with behavioral disorders not only have higher morbidity and mortality 
</p>
<p>rates but are also at higher risk for underdiagnosis of major physical disorders 
</p>
<p>(Becker et&nbsp;al., 2010; McCabe &amp; Leas, 2008), while women who have depressive 
</p>
<p>symptoms or anxiety are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, which is the lead-
</p>
<p>ing cause of death in women in developed countries (O&rsquo;Neil et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>The Global Burden of Disease Study (Whiteford et&nbsp;al., 2013) found behavioral 
</p>
<p>disorders are one of the leading causes of disease burden. They are responsible for 
</p>
<p>7.4% of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 22.9% of global years 
</p>
<p>lived with a disability (YLDs). Depression is the most predominant mental health 
</p>
<p>problem followed by anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Despite increased 
</p>
<p>attention and promising advances in the science and practice of women&rsquo;s behavioral 
</p>
<p>health, disparities based upon gender, race, ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status 
</p>
<p>persist, and women continue to have a higher risk than men for most behavioral 
</p>
<p>disorders (Warner &amp; Brown, 2011).
</p>
<p>While there is now a greater recognition of the important role of behavioral 
</p>
<p>health in the overall well-being of individuals and considerable progress in our 
</p>
<p>understanding and treatment of behavioral disorders, there is an increased preva-
</p>
<p>lence of behavioral disorders reported by women in the United States. Data show 
</p>
<p>that almost one-half (48.5%) of American women report a lifetime experience of a 
</p>
<p>mental disorder, and about a third (30.9%) report a disorder in the prior year (Kessler, 
</p>
<p>Berglund, et&nbsp;al., 2005; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, &amp; Walters, 2005).
</p>
<p>Although the presence of multiple chronic conditions increases with age for both 
</p>
<p>genders, women have a higher prevalence of multiple chronic conditions than men 
</p>
<p>(Buttoroff, Ruder, &amp; Bauman, 2017). In the most recent National Comorbidity 
</p>
<p>Replication study, the individual profile for persons with any mental or substance 
</p>
<p>use disorder in the prior year was being female, Hispanic, or African American; with 
</p>
<p>less than a college education and low income; not currently cohabitating; and living 
</p>
<p>in a rural area (Kessler, Berglund, et&nbsp;al., 2005). Behavioral disorders are among the 
</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Behavioral Health Needs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>186
</p>
<p>leading causes of mortality and morbidity for women and men. Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of mental disorders on overall health and life is reported to be simi-
</p>
<p>lar worldwide (Beaglehole, Irwin, &amp; Prentice, 2004; Murray &amp; Lopez, 1996).
</p>
<p>According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
</p>
<p>(SAMHSA, 2014a, 2014b), about 44.7 million adults and 13.7 million children had 
</p>
<p>diagnosable behavioral disorders in 2016 (Ahrnsbrak, Bose, Hedden, Lipari, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Park-Lee, 2017). Most individuals with behavioral health needs do not receive treat-
</p>
<p>ment, even though 80&ndash;90% of these disorders are treatable using medication and 
</p>
<p>other evidence-based therapies (Kessler, Chiu, et&nbsp;al., 2005). Access and utilization 
</p>
<p>barriers include lack of perceived need, lack of health insurance coverage, financial 
</p>
<p>barriers, lack of transportation (Andrade et&nbsp; al., 2014), stigma (Brohan, Slade, 
</p>
<p>Clement, &amp; Thornicroft, 2010; Kakuma et&nbsp;al., 2011), lack of provider reimburse-
</p>
<p>ment, and other structural barriers (e.g., system fragmentation) (Corrigan, Druss, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Perlick, 2014). Since untreated behavioral health conditions are a serious public 
</p>
<p>health concern, efforts are needed to reduce individual, community, and system 
</p>
<p>level barriers to treatment.
</p>
<p>Although prevalence rates for behavioral disorders vary depending upon the 
</p>
<p>study, the age of the population, presence of co-occurring diagnosis such as HIV, 
</p>
<p>and research methods used across the life span, researchers consistently report 
</p>
<p>higher rates of behavioral disorders for females compared with males (Centers for 
</p>
<p>Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2017). Researchers also note that starting in 
</p>
<p>early adolescence, rates of these disorders increase for both genders, but the rates 
</p>
<p>for adolescent females double and continue throughout women&rsquo;s lives (Kessler, 
</p>
<p>Berglund, et&nbsp;al., 2005). Although gender differences might be attributed to women 
</p>
<p>being more willing than men to report symptoms of depression and be more willing 
</p>
<p>than men to seek treatment when they do have symptoms, studies have shown this 
</p>
<p>is not the case and that gender differences do exist (Girgus &amp; Yang, 2015). Depression 
</p>
<p>in women is correlated with genes, hormonal changes, stress, and other factors and 
</p>
<p>is pronounced during puberty, pregnancy, and perimenopause (Albert, 2015).
</p>
<p> Substance Abuse
</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been growing attention to the importance of gender in the 
</p>
<p>treatment of substance use disorders in women. While past medical research mainly 
</p>
<p>focused on men, there is now growing recognition that biologic and psychosocial 
</p>
<p>differences between men and women influence the prevalence, presentation, comor-
</p>
<p>bidity, and treatment of substance use disorders (Greenfield et&nbsp;al., 2007).
</p>
<p>In the recent past, alcohol and substance dependence and abuse have predomi-
</p>
<p>nately been seen as a male problem, as the research shows higher prevalence rates 
</p>
<p>of drug and alcohol use disorders among men. The National Institute on Alcohol 
</p>
<p>Abuse and Alcoholism&rsquo;s National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related 
</p>
<p>Conditions (NESARC) found that men are twice as likely as women to meet life-
</p>
<p>time DSM-V criteria for any drug use disorder (12.3% of men vs. 7.7% of women) 
</p>
<p>M. A. Becker and V. A. Lynn</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>187
</p>
<p>(Grant et&nbsp; al., 2016). Twelve-month prevalence rates of alcohol abuse are almost 
</p>
<p>twice as high among men as they are among women (17.6% of men vs 10.4% of 
</p>
<p>women) (Grant et&nbsp;al., 2015). On the other hand, research also shows the prevalence 
</p>
<p>rates of prescription drug abuse in women closely approach that of men. The Office 
</p>
<p>of the Surgeon (2016) reported 12.5 million Americans reported misusing prescrip-
</p>
<p>tion pain relievers in the past year. Twelve-month prevalence rates of abuse or 
</p>
<p>dependence for non-medical use of pain relievers were 20.5% for men and 15.3% 
</p>
<p>for women (Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).
</p>
<p>Women and men differ in substance abuse etiology, disease progression, and 
</p>
<p>adherence to treatment. Alcohol is the most common substance abused by both men 
</p>
<p>and women. Although men have higher rates of use, women have more severe health 
</p>
<p>consequences and are more likely to overdose due to continued use and higher rates 
</p>
<p>of illicit drugs (Fernandez-Montalvo, Lopez-Goni, Azanza, Arteaga, &amp; Cacho, 
</p>
<p>2017; Greenfield, Back, Lawson, &amp; Brady, 2010; Greenfield et&nbsp; al., 2007; Picci 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2012; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014a).
</p>
<p>Given the aging of the &ldquo;baby boomer&rdquo; generation who uses alcohol and other 
</p>
<p>drugs at a higher rate than past generations, and longer lifespans overall, it is antici-
</p>
<p>pated that society will need additional specialized screenings, interventions, and 
</p>
<p>treatments for addiction. This is noteworthy and concerning; women have greater 
</p>
<p>medical vulnerability and social consequences associated as their behavioral disor-
</p>
<p>ders continue across age groups. Women carry additional risks during pregnancy 
</p>
<p>because of the effects medication, alcohol, and illicit drugs have on the developing 
</p>
<p>fetus (Erol &amp; Karpyak, 2015). Since explanations for gender, racial, and age differ-
</p>
<p>ences in behavioral disorders are evolving, continued research is required.
</p>
<p> Comorbidity
</p>
<p>Co-occurring physical disorders may lead to an increased risk of mental disorders, 
</p>
<p>and mental disorders may increase a person&rsquo;s risk for a medical disorder, yet many 
</p>
<p>comorbidities often go undetected (Goodell, Druss, Walker, &amp; Mat, 2011). 
</p>
<p>Comorbidity, having more than one chronic health condition at a time, is a growing 
</p>
<p>public health concern, with one in four adults in the United States having two or 
</p>
<p>more chronic health conditions and disorders and complex comorbidities.
</p>
<p>The NCS-R reported approximately 74% of adults having one or more disorders 
</p>
<p>in the previous 12&nbsp;months (Druss et&nbsp;al., 2009). Despite the prevalence and clinical 
</p>
<p>importance of comorbid disorders, relatively little is known about the etiology of 
</p>
<p>these disorders, and most of the epidemiological research on comorbidity is rela-
</p>
<p>tively recent. Additional research is clearly needed as comorbidity is increasingly 
</p>
<p>associated with worse health outcomes, more complex clinical management, and 
</p>
<p>increased health-care costs. Understanding the nature of comorbidity through 
</p>
<p>research has great potential value, as it could help identify the targets for prevention 
</p>
<p>and treatment interventions. If comorbidity arises because different mental and 
</p>
<p>physical disorders share the same risk factors, then interventions addressing these 
</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Behavioral Health Needs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188
</p>
<p>risk factors should help to reduce the prevalence and disability from frequently 
</p>
<p>occurring comorbidities.
</p>
<p> Mental and&nbsp;Substance Abuse Disorders
</p>
<p>There are several gender differences in the relationship between mental and sub-
</p>
<p>stance use disorders. Epidemiologic studies of treatment-seeking women indicate 
</p>
<p>that gender differences in the patterns of comorbid mental disorders in substance 
</p>
<p>users follow the same patterns experienced by women in the general population. 
</p>
<p>Women with comorbid mental disorders are more likely to meet criteria for anxiety, 
</p>
<p>depression, eating disorders, and borderline personality disorder and men more 
</p>
<p>likely to meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder (Anker &amp; Carroll, 2010; 
</p>
<p>Grant et&nbsp;al., 2015; Grant et&nbsp;al., 2016; Greenfield et&nbsp;al., 2010; Lieber, 2000). A num-
</p>
<p>ber of studies also indicate that for women, the onset of the mental disorder is more 
</p>
<p>likely to antedate the onset of their substance use disorder (Back, Contini, &amp; Brady, 
</p>
<p>2007; Greenfield et&nbsp;al., 2007; Mann et&nbsp;al., 2005).
</p>
<p> Co-occurring Physical Illnesses
</p>
<p>The typical woman with a behavioral disorder often has a co-occurring physical 
</p>
<p>health condition (Becker &amp; Gatz, 2005; Larson et&nbsp;al., 2005). Since co-occurring 
</p>
<p>physical health disorders are more common in women than men, successful treat-
</p>
<p>ment requires an interdisciplinary approach to health care as well as health-care 
</p>
<p>providers who are competent in recognizing, referring, and treating common co- 
</p>
<p>occurring physical and behavioral disorders. Untreated or undertreated physical and 
</p>
<p>behavioral health conditions can result in premature death, functional limitations, 
</p>
<p>increased service utilization, and lowered quality of life for women with dual and 
</p>
<p>triple diagnoses. The literature shows that women with behavioral disorders are at 
</p>
<p>higher risk for both acute and chronic physical disorders (De Hert et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p>Despite the high prevalence and negative impact of co-occurring physical and 
</p>
<p>behavioral disorders, many primary care providers fail to detect these conditions, 
</p>
<p>and some believe that women with behavioral disorders will not make good use of 
</p>
<p>health-care services. This is unfortunate because women have a higher risk for a 
</p>
<p>number of physical health conditions including cardiovascular disease and cancer. 
</p>
<p>Thus, primary care clinicians should carefully screen for physical health conditions 
</p>
<p>among women with a behavioral disorder. As a result of higher rates of serious 
</p>
<p>physical illness and underdiagnoses of physical health conditions, women with 
</p>
<p>behavioral disorders have higher rates of premature death (Olfson, Gerhard, Huang, 
</p>
<p>Crystal, &amp; Stroup, 2015).
</p>
<p>Research shows that for up to half of all primary care patients, there are no physi-
</p>
<p>cal explanations for their symptoms (Edwards, Stern, Clarke, Ivbijaro, &amp; Kasney, 
</p>
<p>M. A. Becker and V. A. Lynn</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>189
</p>
<p>2010; Institute of Medicine, 2006; Lipsitt, Joseph, Meyer, &amp; Notman, 2015). Data 
</p>
<p>from the Medical Outcomes Study suggest that primary care clinicians fail to recog-
</p>
<p>nize 50% of patients with depression (Katon, 2003), a failing that continues today 
</p>
<p>(Knickman et&nbsp;al., 2016). In addition, gynecologic care, pregnancy, family planning, 
</p>
<p>and contraception are issues that deserve special attention in women with behav-
</p>
<p>ioral disorders. Treatment of behavioral disorders during pregnancy requires careful 
</p>
<p>thought, as there is scant data on the use of psychotropic medication in this popula-
</p>
<p>tion (Byatt et&nbsp;al., 2018). Decisions about medication during pregnancy are compli-
</p>
<p>cated further due to the small number of adequate studies and relative absence of 
</p>
<p>randomized control trials.
</p>
<p>In response to current epidemiologic data, the principle that &ldquo;there is no health 
</p>
<p>without mental health&rdquo; is gaining ground. Efforts to transform America&rsquo;s public 
</p>
<p>behavioral health delivery systems to systems that are more person-centered, 
</p>
<p>recovery- focused, evidenced-based, and quality-driven are intensifying. Due, in 
</p>
<p>part, to the Surgeon General&rsquo;s reports on mental health and addiction (Office of the 
</p>
<p>Surgeon General, 1999, 2016), the efforts of the World Health Organization (GBD 
</p>
<p>2016 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2016), and the President&rsquo;s New Freedom 
</p>
<p>Commission on Mental Health (2003), a broader framework for health has been 
</p>
<p>advocated which emphasizes the idea that disease extends beyond its clinical dimen-
</p>
<p>sions. This broader framework makes it essential that public health practitioners, 
</p>
<p>policy makers, consumers, and advocates understand the extent and distribution of 
</p>
<p>behavioral disorders and disability, so they can develop policies and practices that 
</p>
<p>reduce health disparities and contribute to people&rsquo;s daily activities and participation 
</p>
<p>in society (President&rsquo;s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003).
</p>
<p> Health Disparities
</p>
<p>Despite current efforts to close the gap between socioeconomic status between 
</p>
<p>majority and minority populations, health disparities continue to exist (Peck &amp; 
</p>
<p>Denney, 2012; Primm et&nbsp; al., 2010). Health disparities occur across intersecting 
</p>
<p>identities; include race/ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic status, disability sta-
</p>
<p>tus, sexual identify, and sexual orientation; and refer to differences between groups 
</p>
<p>in health insurance coverage, access to and use of care, and quality of care (Chen, 
</p>
<p>Vargas-Bustamante, Mortensen, &amp; Ortega, 2016). Healthy People 2020 defines a 
</p>
<p>health disparity as:
</p>
<p>A particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or 
</p>
<p>environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have 
</p>
<p>systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; 
</p>
<p>religion; socioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical 
</p>
<p>disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteris-
</p>
<p>tics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. (The Secretary&rsquo;s Advisory Committee 
</p>
<p>on National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives for 2020, 2008, October 
</p>

</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Behavioral Health Needs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>190
</p>
<p>Data show that women from different ethnic and cultural groups, as well as other 
</p>
<p>minority populations, such as LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/
</p>
<p>questioning), have multiple intersecting identities increasing health disparities and 
</p>
<p>negative health outcomes (Adepoju, Preston, &amp; Gonzales, 2015; National Academies 
</p>
<p>of Sciences, Engineering, &amp; Medicine, 2017). For example, over the past few 
</p>
<p>decades, the gap in life expectancy between men and women is narrowing and is 
</p>
<p>due, in part, to an increase in mortality for women (Arias, 2016; Chetty et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>The challenges faced by women from minority and other underserved groups are 
</p>
<p>well documented and include lower socioeconomic status, poorer health conditions, 
</p>
<p>lower use of services, higher rates of premature death, disease, and disability status 
</p>
<p>(Jang, Chiriboga, &amp; Becker, 2010). The complex relationships among biological, 
</p>
<p>physical, and social environmental factors influence access to care and affect popu-
</p>
<p>lation and individual health outcomes (Institute of Medicine, 2010). These chal-
</p>
<p>lenges and the devalued status of minority and underserved women have important 
</p>
<p>implications for behavioral health services provided to minority populations.
</p>
<p>Women from an underserved population may present with somatic complaints or 
</p>
<p>other symptoms not traditionally associated with a behavioral health diagnosis 
</p>
<p>(Kohrt et&nbsp;al., 2014). In addition, women from an underserved population may be 
</p>
<p>less trusting, less adherent, and more skeptical. Further, chronic physical illnesses 
</p>
<p>may result in depression and or anxiety, and patients from minority populations may 
</p>
<p>respond differently to medications. Since each patient&rsquo;s culture and ethnic back-
</p>
<p>ground must be addressed when they present for behavioral health services, clini-
</p>
<p>cians should always ask about cultural issues and determine if they are of concern 
</p>
<p>in the treatment of their client (Kohrt et&nbsp;al., 2014). Good communication, clarity, 
</p>
<p>and collaboration are key to successful patient-provider relationships and positive 
</p>
<p>behavioral health treatment outcomes across diverse groups (Kohrt et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p>Location also is an important consideration, as there are significant differences in 
</p>
<p>access to care for women who live in rural and urban areas, as the majority of behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health providers work in high population metropolitan areas (Ellis, Konrad, 
</p>
<p>Thomas, &amp; Morrissey, 2009). Women living in rural areas are more likely to be 
</p>
<p>poor, lack health insurance, and often travel longer distances to access medical, 
</p>
<p>dental, and behavioral health specialty services (Buzza et&nbsp;al., 2011). Rural women 
</p>
<p>are also more likely than urban women to experience stressors related to behavioral 
</p>
<p>health, yet they are less likely to receive behavioral health services (Weaver &amp; 
</p>
<p>Himle, 2017).
</p>
<p>Barriers to behavioral health care are a major concern. An estimated 40% of 
</p>
<p>women in rural areas seek mental health treatment in a primary care setting rather 
</p>
<p>than a behavioral health-care setting, yet stigma is a significant barrier when living 
</p>
<p>in small communities (Smalley et&nbsp;al., 2010). Rural populations have higher rates of 
</p>
<p>behavioral and somatic health conditions (i.e., substance abuse, smoking, and obe-
</p>
<p>sity) compared to urban populations. Further, up to 40% of rural women have 
</p>
<p>comorbid substance use and mental disorders and higher rates of suicide (Smalley 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2010). While there have been some policy changes to improve health services

</p>
<p>delivery, outcomes have not been sufficient in meeting the health needs of this popu-
</p>
<p>lation. Additional policies need to be developed to address the needs of underserved 
</p>
<p>populations (Smalley et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p> Selected Issues in&nbsp;Women&rsquo;s Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Understanding, preventing, and managing women&rsquo;s health involve understanding 
</p>
<p>their unique health needs in relation to specific physical and behavioral health con-
</p>
<p>ditions. The next section discusses issues related to women diagnosed with human 
</p>
<p>immunodeficiency virus (HIV), postpartum depression (PPD), and women who 
</p>
<p>have experienced trauma. These three conditions have a major impact on women&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>behavioral health, and they are a particular problem for women living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>Despite their prevalence and association with poorer health-care outcomes, they are 
</p>
<p>an under-researched population and require more attention and additional research.
</p>
<p> Women and&nbsp;HIV
</p>
<p>The burden of behavioral health conditions among women living with human 
</p>
<p>immunodeficiency virus (WLHIV) is a significant public health concern. Innovative 
</p>
<p>methods of detecting and treating the complex physical and behavioral health con-
</p>
<p>ditions of WLHIV are needed to improve health outcomes and women&rsquo;s quality of 
</p>
<p>life. Over the past 35&nbsp;years, public health has made tremendous accomplishments in 
</p>
<p>the prevention and treatment of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
</p>
<p>(AIDS). In the early days of the epidemic, HIV was seen as a death sentence. Today, 
</p>
<p>HIV is considered a chronic health condition that can be controlled with medica-
</p>
<p>tions (Brooks et&nbsp;al., 2017; Cohen et&nbsp;al., 2016; Rodger et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>Although HIV in women is life changing and significantly increases morbidity 
</p>
<p>and mortality (Quinlivan et&nbsp;al., 2015), access to highly active antiretroviral therapy 
</p>
<p>(HAART) for the treatment of HIV increases life expectancy, improves quality of 
</p>
<p>life, and has the potential to reduce transmission of HIV (Rodger et&nbsp; al., 2016). 
</p>
<p>However, women are less likely to use or have access to HAART, and WLHIV often 
</p>
<p>face an array of co-occurring physical and mental health conditions as well as socio-
</p>
<p>economic hardships that impede their ability to maintain access to care and treat-
</p>
<p>ment (Beer, Mattson, Bradley, &amp; Skarbinski, 2016).
</p>
<p>Globally, women account for more than 50% of the 36.7 million persons living 
</p>
<p>with HIV (PLHIV), with approximately 380,000 new HIV infections occurring 
</p>
<p>among girls and women aged 15&ndash;24 each year (UNAIDS, 2017). In the United 
</p>
<p>States, women represent approximately 25% of the 1.2 million PLHIV, and women 
</p>
<p>of color are disproportionately affected by HIV (CDC, 2017). Even though women 
</p>
<p>of color account for less than 30% of the US population, they represent nearly 80% 
</p>
<p>of all WLHIV (CDC, 2015). Not only are they less likely to engage in care; women 
</p>

<p>192
</p>
<p>of color are at a higher risk for morbidity and mortality compared with men and 
</p>
<p>white women (Quinlivan et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p>Although many WLHIV are living longer healthier lives, an HIV diagnosis 
</p>
<p>impacts physical, psychological, and social well-being, and WLHIV experience an 
</p>
<p>increased prevalence of behavioral health conditions when compared to men (Orza 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2015) and the general population (Chapin-Bardales, Rosenberg, &amp; Sullivan, 
</p>
<p>2017). WLHIV have high levels of emotional distress and report more psychologi-
</p>
<p>cal and psychosocial problems including fear, loss, grief, hopelessness, guilt, low 
</p>
<p>self-esteem, anxiety, depression, denial, and anger (Fabianova, 2011). In addition, 
</p>
<p>WLHIV are affected by high rates of sexual and physical trauma in childhood and 
</p>
<p>as adults. A recent meta-analysis reports the estimated rate of recent post-traumatic 
</p>
<p>stress disorder (PTSD) in WLHIV is 30.0%, over five times the national rate for 
</p>
<p>women. In addition, intimate partner violence (IPV) among WLHIV was estimated 
</p>
<p>at 55%, twice the national rate (Machtinger, Wilson, Haberer, &amp; Weiss, 2012).
</p>
<p>A large-scale study conducted in the southeastern United States found as high as 
</p>
<p>60% of PLHIV report symptoms of mental illness, 32% report substance use prob-
</p>
<p>lems, and 23% are triply diagnosed with HIV, substance abuse, and a mental health 
</p>
<p>problem, with women reporting a higher number of mental illness symptoms 
</p>
<p>(Whetten et&nbsp; al., 2005). Clinical management of HIV for these triple diagnoses 
</p>
<p>requires integrated treatment services that address both mitigation of substance use 
</p>
<p>and psychiatric and medical symptoms and other health behaviors (Durvasula &amp; 
</p>
<p>Miller, 2014).
</p>
<p>Health-care systems around the world are now making an effort to integrate 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services with primary health care. Integration can increase access 
</p>
<p>to mental health and substance abuse services and improve adherence to lifesaving 
</p>
<p>HIV treatment. There is a need to educate both primary care and HIV specialists 
</p>
<p>about the importance of routine screening of WLHIV for depression, anxiety, sub-
</p>
<p>stance use, and other mental health conditions.
</p>
<p> Postpartum Depression
</p>
<p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health condition and a major con-
</p>
<p>cern for women. About half of postpartum women experience the &ldquo;baby blues,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>whereas about 10%&ndash;15% of new mothers experience PPD (Yim, Tanner Stapleton, 
</p>
<p>Guardino, Hahn-Holbrook, &amp; Dunkel Schetter, 2015). PPD, also called postnatal or 
</p>
<p>perinatal depression, is a type of mood disorder associated with childbirth. The 
</p>
<p>postpartum period begins immediately following childbirth and continues for 
</p>
<p>6&nbsp;weeks. The exact cause of PPD is unclear; however, it is believed to be a combina-
</p>
<p>tion of physical and emotional factors that may include hormonal changes in addi-
</p>
<p>tion to sleep deprivation and other stressors associated with a new infant in the 
</p>
<p>family (Jevitt, Groer, Crist, Gonzalez, &amp; Wagner, 2012). Risk factors include prior 
</p>
<p>episodes of PPD, bipolar disorder, a family or personal history of depression, 
</p>
<p>M. A. Becker and V. A. Lynn</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>193
</p>
<p>psychological stress, complications of childbirth, lack of social support, history of 
</p>
<p>violence, or a drug use disorder (Dennis &amp; Vigod, 2013).
</p>
<p>Symptoms of PPD can include extreme sadness, low energy, anxiety, crying epi-
</p>
<p>sodes, irritability, and changes in sleeping or eating patterns. PPD can affect the 
</p>
<p>health of the mother as well as the health and development of her child(ren). 
</p>
<p>Maternal bonding with her new infant may be impaired, leading to attachment and 
</p>
<p>developmental delays for the child (Howard et&nbsp;al., 2014). Onset is typically between 
</p>
<p>1&nbsp;week and 3&nbsp;months following childbirth and affects up to 15% of women around 
</p>
<p>childbirth and, in some women, leads to postpartum psychosis (Pearlstein, Howard, 
</p>
<p>Salisbury, &amp; Zlotnick, 2009; Spinelli, 2004).
</p>
<p>Postpartum psychosis is a more severe form of postpartum mood disorder that 
</p>
<p>occurs in about 1&minus;2 women per 1000 following childbirth. Postpartum psychosis is 
</p>
<p>one of the leading causes of the murder of children less than 1&nbsp;year of age. In the 
</p>
<p>United States, this occurs in about 8 per 100,000 births (Spinelli, 2004).
</p>
<p>Review of antidepressant medication use during pregnancy suggests these medi-
</p>
<p>cations increase perinatal disorders, including congenital malformations and neuro-
</p>
<p>logic injury (Yaeger, Smith, &amp; Altshuler, 2006), and women often stop their use 
</p>
<p>during pregnancy (Petersen, Gilbert, Evans, Man, &amp; Nazareth, 2011). Research on 
</p>
<p>PPD also suggests that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can increase the risk 
</p>
<p>of congenital heart defects (Chambers, Moses-Kolko, &amp; Wisner, 2007). There are 
</p>
<p>fewer studies on postpartum psychosis, so clinicians know less about the health 
</p>
<p>outcomes of antipsychotic medication use during pregnancy among women with 
</p>
<p>PPD.&nbsp;Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options (e.g., inter-
</p>
<p>personal therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy) are important because, without 
</p>
<p>treatment, PPD can last for months or years. In addition to its effects on the mother&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>health, PPD can interfere with the mother&rsquo;s ability to nurture and connect with her 
</p>
<p>baby, which may cause the baby to have problems with sleeping, eating, and behav-
</p>
<p>ior as he or she grows.
</p>
<p> Trauma-Informed Services
</p>
<p>Trauma, stigma, and discrimination are also factors that influence health-care out-
</p>
<p>comes for women. There is ample evidence regarding the high prevalence of trauma, 
</p>
<p>violence, and abuse against women, which increases the prevalence of behavioral 
</p>
<p>disorders and the need for trauma-informed services. Trauma-informed care (TIC) 
</p>
<p>is an intervention and approach to services that focuses on how trauma may affect a 
</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s life and her response to behavioral health services from prevention through 
</p>
<p>treatment. Trauma refers to extreme stress that overwhelms a person&rsquo;s ability to 
</p>
<p>cope. Clinicians meet with various clients in a wide range of settings, and while 
</p>
<p>each client has different needs and goals and requires different care approaches, the 
</p>
<p>common thread is awareness of the need for trauma-informed care (Muskett, 2014).
</p>
<p>According to SAMHSA (2014a, 2014b), trauma-informed services are based on 
</p>
<p>an understanding of the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma survivors that traditional 
</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Behavioral Health Needs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>194
</p>
<p>service delivery approaches may exacerbate. Thus, trauma-informed services are 
</p>
<p>designed to be very supportive and avoid any potential re-traumatization of the cli-
</p>
<p>ent. Trauma-informed care can also be viewed as an overarching philosophy and 
</p>
<p>approach, or a set of universal precautions, designed to be both preventive and reha-
</p>
<p>bilitative in nature, in which the relationship among environment, triggers, and per-
</p>
<p>ceived dangers are noted and addressed.
</p>
<p>Trauma-informed care is based on the understanding that many clients have suf-
</p>
<p>fered traumatic experiences, and the provider is responsible for being sensitive to 
</p>
<p>this fact, regardless of whether a person is being treated specifically for the trauma 
</p>
<p>(Huckshorn &amp; LeBel, 2013). Therefore, all clinicians should approach their clients 
</p>
<p>as if they have a trauma history, regardless of the services for which the clients are 
</p>
<p>being seen.
</p>
<p>Women of special concern who require trauma-informed services include the 
</p>
<p>growing population of incarcerated women, female veterans, and active female 
</p>
<p>military personnel who are often exposed to trauma, violence, and abuse (Friedman, 
</p>
<p>Collier, &amp; Hall, 2016; Lehavot, O&rsquo;Hara, Washington, Yano, &amp; Simpson, 2015; 
</p>
<p>Mustillo et&nbsp;al., 2015). Unfortunately, these women frequently have limited access to 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services and often suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder 
</p>
<p>(PTSD). For example, it has been reported that as many as 30 percent of women 
</p>
<p>were raped during their military services; this compounds the heavy burden already 
</p>
<p>experienced by female veterans and their families (Zinzow, Grubaugh, Monnier, 
</p>
<p>Suffoletta-Maierle, &amp; Frueh, 2007). Thus, there is a critical need for new initiatives 
</p>
<p>to address both the short- and long-term effects of trauma, violence, and abuse expe-
</p>
<p>rienced by female veterans and women suffering from interpersonal violence.
</p>
<p> Services Delivery
</p>
<p>Community behavioral health-care programs face many challenges and incur sky-
</p>
<p>rocketing costs. Persons with behavioral health problems often do not receive the 
</p>
<p>behavioral health-care services they need and those with serious chronic disorders 
</p>
<p>die, on average, 25&nbsp;years earlier than persons without behavioral health problems 
</p>
<p>(Olfson et&nbsp;al., 2015). The seminal US President&rsquo;s New Freedom Commission on 
</p>
<p>Mental Health (2003) identified fragmentation of health delivery systems as one of 
</p>
<p>the three major obstacles impeding the treatment of behavioral disorders in the 
</p>
<p>United States. The observed system fragmentation that characterizes the American 
</p>
<p>health-care systems has direct implications for access to services and the utilization 
</p>
<p>of effective health care for both primary and behavioral health-care consumers.
</p>
<p>Successful models of behavioral health care most often use a &ldquo;strengths-based&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>model or approach to service delivery that promotes the well-being of both clients 
</p>
<p>and society (Tse et&nbsp;al., 2016). In a strength-based approach, the professional tells the 
</p>
<p>client to think about problems, responses, or situations they solved in the past. This 
</p>
<p>reflective approach promotes the well-being of the client because it helps the client 
</p>
<p>realize their strength(s) and the possibilities they have to deal with their problems. 
</p>
<p>M. A. Becker and V. A. Lynn</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>195
</p>
<p>The strength-based approach helps the client identify successful solutions to cope 
</p>
<p>with their behavioral health problems and assists communities and individuals to 
</p>
<p>solve their behavioral health service delivery challenges.
</p>
<p>Integrated health care is another model or approach to services delivery pro-
</p>
<p>moted to improve health-care outcomes and reduce costs. Integrated care is the 
</p>
<p>systematic coordination of physical and behavioral health care. Since physical and 
</p>
<p>behavioral health problems often occur simultaneously, integrating services to treat 
</p>
<p>both will yield the best results and be the most acceptable and effective approach for 
</p>
<p>those being served (Kuramoto, 2014). In addition to service system fragmentation, 
</p>
<p>health literacy affects health outcomes for women and is an issue of increasing con-
</p>
<p>cern, as clients are expected to take more responsibility for their own treatment 
</p>
<p>outcomes.
</p>
<p> Health Literacy
</p>
<p>Title V of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 is &ldquo;the degree to 
</p>
<p>which an individual has the capacity to obtain, communicate, process, and under-
</p>
<p>stand health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(&sect;5002(b)(21), p.&nbsp;473). Low health literacy is associated with poorer health out-
</p>
<p>comes and poorer use of health-care services which is why health literacy and health 
</p>
<p>literacy skills are important and should be developed (Berkman, Sheridan, Donahue, 
</p>
<p>Halpern, &amp; Crotty, 2011). Health literacy skills are used by people to realize their 
</p>
<p>potential in health situations. Anyone who needs health information and services 
</p>
<p>needs health literacy skills to obtain needed behavioral health information and ser-
</p>
<p>vices. Therefore, health literacy is vital to improving behavioral health outcomes for 
</p>
<p>women.
</p>
<p>In general, health literacy in America is quite low; approximately 80 million 
</p>
<p>adults have low basic health literacy (Berkman et&nbsp;al., 2011). Basic health literacy 
</p>
<p>allows women to understand information (e.g., diagnostic, treatment, medication, 
</p>
<p>and lifestyle change) provided by a health and behavioral health-care professional 
</p>
<p>(e.g., physician, social worker, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>specialist). An expanded model of health literacy includes the ability of consumers 
</p>
<p>to generate questions about their health, understand the health information pro-
</p>
<p>vided, and be able to engage effectively with treatment protocols and procedures. As 
</p>
<p>treatment becomes more complex with the adoption of evidence-based practices, 
</p>
<p>such as new psychopharmacological agents, health literacy will become even more 
</p>
<p>important in the treatment of both physical and behavioral disorders.
</p>
<p>Making information useful to particular clients begins with identifying the intended 
</p>
<p>users of the health information and services. Clinicians should evaluate users&rsquo; under-
</p>
<p>standing before, during, and after providing health information and services. They 
</p>
<p>should also be sure the materials and messages reflect the age, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>diversity, language, and literacy skills of the intended users. Other components to 
</p>
<p>consider are patients&rsquo; economic contexts, access to services, and life experiences.
</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Behavioral Health Needs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>196
</p>
<p>Beyond demographics, culture, and language, clinicians must consider the com-
</p>
<p>munication capacities of the intended users. Approximately one in six Americans 
</p>
<p>has a communication disorder (Black, Vahratian, &amp; Hoffman, 2015). These indi-
</p>
<p>viduals require communication strategies tailored to their specific needs. Hence, 
</p>
<p>clinicians should determine what information patients need to know and how they 
</p>
<p>will be used. Clinicians can then pretest the information, receive feedback, and 
</p>
<p>refine the information so that it is useful for the client. Plain language helps patients 
</p>
<p>understand the information communicated to them and how they should proceed or 
</p>
<p>continue with an effective treatment plan.
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>In the United States, attention to improving women&rsquo;s behavioral health outcomes is 
</p>
<p>recent. Collaborative efforts by federal agencies to effect positive changes and pro-
</p>
<p>mote progress to improve the overall health of the nation&rsquo;s women and girls were 
</p>
<p>detailed first in Action Steps for Improving Women&rsquo;s Mental Health (Office on 
</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Health, 2009). This comprehensive groundbreaking report, issued by the 
</p>
<p>National Mental Health Information Center, foreshadow international action plans 
</p>
<p>suggested by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2015, 
</p>
<p>2017). Among other things, the action steps encouraged nations to &ldquo;Promote a 
</p>
<p>recovery-oriented, strengths-based approach to treatment for women&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Build 
</p>
<p>resilience and protective factors to promote the mental health of girls and women 
</p>
<p>and aid recovery&rdquo; (Office on Women&rsquo;s Health, 2009, p. iiiiii). These action steps 
</p>
<p>support the goals of the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 
</p>
<p>2015, p.&nbsp; 1111) to (1) &ldquo;provide comprehensive, integrated and responsive mental 
</p>
<p>health and social care services in community-based settings&rdquo; and (2) &ldquo;implement 
</p>
<p>strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health.&rdquo; Both of these documents 
</p>
<p>are a response to research that documented low rates of health-care services avail-
</p>
<p>able to women with behavioral disorders and evidence that medical care for women 
</p>
<p>needed to be improved.
</p>
<p>To improve health-care outcomes for women with behavioral health needs, 
</p>
<p>health-care policies and delivery systems around the world need to integrate behav-
</p>
<p>ioral and physical health services. Integrated care would not only increase access to 
</p>
<p>behavioral and physical health-care services but could also improve adherence to 
</p>
<p>lifesaving physical and behavioral health treatment.
</p>
<p>Despite the increase in life expectancy and development of new medications for 
</p>
<p>more effective treatment of behavioral disorders, women continue to face increased 
</p>
<p>vulnerability and gender-based risks for major depression, PTSD, anxiety, and 
</p>
<p> eating disorders. In addition, women with behavioral disorders face significant 
</p>
<p>social stigma and discrimination.
</p>
<p>Overcoming the stigma and discrimination associated with behavioral disorders 
</p>
<p>must become a national priority. Research suggests that women may neglect care 
</p>
<p>for their mental disorder because of stigma and discrimination associated with these 
</p>
<p>M. A. Becker and V. A. Lynn</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>197
</p>
<p>disorders (Corrigan et&nbsp;al., 2014). In an effort to avoid being shamed, or because of 
</p>
<p>self-doubt brought on by shaming, women with a mental or substance use disorder 
</p>
<p>may try to hide their disorder from family or avoid disclosing their symptoms to 
</p>
<p>their doctor. The signs of alcohol and other drug abuse, anorexia, bulimia, anxiety, 
</p>
<p>and depression often are concealed until a life-threatening incident occurs. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, delaying behavioral health care can have serious negative conse-
</p>
<p>quences. Designing health-care systems to integrate behavioral health into physical 
</p>
<p>or primary health care could reduce stigma and free women with behavioral disor-
</p>
<p>ders from any shame or discrimination from their conditions that they or their fam-
</p>
<p>ily may have experienced. Integrated health care can break through the barrier of 
</p>
<p>stigma and help clients know that help is available without criticism or blame. 
</p>
<p>Although much outreach needs to be done to overcome mental health stigma, the 
</p>
<p>growing adoption of integrated care is making real gains in reducing stigma in the 
</p>
<p>communities we serve.
</p>
<p>Lastly, to improve both access and quality of health-care services, a radical trans-
</p>
<p>formation of health-care systems will be needed to eliminate disparities in health- 
</p>
<p>care outcomes that currently exist in both behavioral and physical health-care 
</p>
<p>services. To provide essential behavioral health education and disease prevention, 
</p>
<p>an integrated information technology and communications infrastructure is critical. 
</p>
<p>An effective communication infrastructure, at a minimum, would include the inte-
</p>
<p>gration of medical records, the use of interdisciplinary teams, and use of surveil-
</p>
<p>lance systems for tracking health-care progress and treatment outcomes.
</p>
<p>Since behavioral disorders begin in childhood and adolescence, successful 
</p>
<p>behavioral health policy and efforts in prevention and early intervention should be 
</p>
<p>targeted toward this critical period. Currently, there is also a growing need for the 
</p>
<p>provision of behavioral health policies and services for women who are incarcerated 
</p>
<p>in jails and prisons as well as the increasing number of women in the military. These 
</p>
<p>at-risk populations create an increased demand for communities, states, and federal 
</p>
<p>health-care systems to provide greater access to effective and affordable behavioral 
</p>
<p>health-care services for women.
</p>
<p>As acknowledged by the multiple World Health Organization reports cited in this 
</p>
<p>chapter and discussed in Action Steps for Improving Women&rsquo;s Mental Health (2009), 
</p>
<p>there is an opportunity and an urgent need to improve access, utilization, and quality 
</p>
<p>of behavioral health services for women in the United States and worldwide. 
</p>
<p>However, given global budgets for health care and the dramatic reductions in state 
</p>
<p>and federal (financial) support for health, education, and social services in the 
</p>
<p>United States, it remains to be seen if the opportunity will be realized. Nevertheless, 
</p>
<p>the recommendations of the President&rsquo;s New Freedom Commission (2003), the 
</p>
<p>Action Steps for Improving Women&rsquo;s Mental Health (2009), and the recent National 
</p>
<p>Academies workshop on Women&rsquo;s Mental Health Across the Life Course Through a 
</p>
<p>Sex-Gender Lens (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, &amp; Medicine, 
</p>
<p>2018) provide a blueprint for progress in improving women&rsquo;s behavioral and physi-
</p>
<p>cal health that could be realized with adequate leadership and financial support.
</p>
<p>In support of integrated care, there is a need for reimbursement policies that 
</p>
<p>provide for care management services which are needed by women with complex 
</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Behavioral Health Needs</p>

</p>
<p>co-occurring disorders. Finally, providing quality health care for women with com-
</p>
<p>plex health-care needs requires additional training, collaboration between special-
</p>
<p>ists, and the provision of case management services, which will increase the costs 
</p>
<p>of care and require additional reimbursement policy to pay for these services.

<p>The Behavioral Health of&nbsp;American 
Indian/Alaska Native Populations: Risk

</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations include people who main-
</p>
<p>tain tribal affiliation or community attachment with the original populations of 
</p>
<p>North America, South America, and Central America. In the United States (USA), 
</p>
<p>there are 567 AI/AN tribes that are federally recognized, more than 100 tribes that 
</p>
<p>are state recognized, and some tribes that are neither state nor federally recognized 
</p>
<p>(Office of Minority Health, 2018). As of 2012, there were an estimated 5.2 million 
</p>
<p>people, or 2% of the total US population, classified as AI/AN alone or AI/AN in 
</p>
<p>combination with one or more other races. Approximately 25% of AI/AN live on 
</p>
<p>reservations or other trust lands. Of the approximately 75% of the AI/AN who live 
</p>
<p>outside of tribal areas, 60% live in metropolitan areas (Office of Minority Health, 
</p>
<p>2018). Each of these tribal communities has unique cultural teachings, traditions, 
</p>
<p>and languages.
</p>
<p>Rates of diseases and other adverse health outcomes are higher in AI/AN than in 
</p>
<p>other communities in the USA.&nbsp;Heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries are 
</p>
<p>the leading causes of death among AI/AN (Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention 
</p>
<p>[CDC], 2012, 2013). Compared to Whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives have 
</p>
<p>higher rates of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma (Barnes, Adams, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Powell-Griner, 2010). Furthermore, AI/AN men and women are twice as likely to be 
</p>
<p>diagnosed with chronic liver disease than Whites (Office of Minority Health, 2013), 
</p>
<p>and rates of unintentional injuries and deaths are 60% higher in AI/AN compared to 
</p>
<p>Whites (West &amp; Naumann, 2011). The literature also demonstrates major health 
</p>
<p>issues for AI/AN with regard to several behavioral health conditions: substance 
</p>
<p>abuse, post-traumatic stress, violence, and suicide (Gone &amp; Trimble, 2012; Myhra

</p>
<p>Venner, &amp; Kahler, 2015; Yuan, Duran, Walters, Pearson, &amp; Evans- Campbell, 2014).
</p>
<p>The American Indian Service Utilization, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Risk and 
</p>
<p>Protective Factors Project found the prevalence of DSM-IV disorders was 35.7% for 
</p>
<p>women to nearly 50% for men (Beals et&nbsp;al., 2005). The most common disorder for 
</p>
<p>women was post-traumatic stress disorder and for men, alcohol abuse and depen-
</p>
<p>dence. Significant levels of comorbidity were found among those with depressive 
</p>
<p>and/or anxiety and substance use disorders (Beals et&nbsp;al., 2005).
</p>
<p>To fully understand the behavioral health disparities experienced by AI/AN, it is 
</p>
<p>critical to examine the context in which they occur. High prevalence of behavioral 
</p>
<p>disorders in AI/AN communities is believed to be linked to a number of historical 
</p>
<p>and environmental factors, such as historical trauma and contemporary discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion, as well as current-day unemployment, academic failure, high-risk occupations, 
</p>
<p>and lack of health insurance (Andrews, Guerrero, Wooten, &amp; Lengnick-Hall, 2015; 
</p>
<p>Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, 2013; Moghaddam, Momper, &amp; Fong, 
</p>
<p>2013; Stanley, Harness, Swaim, &amp; Beauvais, 2014).
</p>
<p>Currently, one in four AI/AN live in poverty (Macartney, Bishaw, &amp; Fontenot, 
</p>
<p>2013, February). Although AI/AN health-care services are supposed to be provided 
</p>
<p>by the Indian Health Service (HIS) and some tribal health offices, these services are 
</p>
<p>not adequate to cover the health needs. Over one-third of AI/AN have no health 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage (Office of Clinical and Preventive Services, 2011). AI/AN are 
</p>
<p>also underrepresented in the Medicaid expansion population (Andrews et&nbsp;al., 2015), 
</p>
<p>which affects access to and utilization of health and behavioral health services.
</p>
<p>Studies of both urban and rural AI/AN populations have documented poor health, 
</p>
<p>limited health-care options, and limited services utilization (Adekoya, Truman, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Landen, 2015; Brave Heart et&nbsp;al., 2016; Castor et&nbsp;al., 2006; Genovesi, Hastings, 
</p>
<p>Edgerton, &amp; Olson, 2014; Gone &amp; Trimble, 2012; Liao et&nbsp;al., 2011; Murphy et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2014; Reilley et&nbsp;al., 2014; Siordia, Bell, &amp; Haileselassie, 2017; Towne Jr., Probst, 
</p>
<p>Mitchell, &amp; Chen, 2015). Barriers to services and utilization include distance to a 
</p>
<p>care facility, transportation, stigma, lack of cultural sensitivity among health-care 
</p>
<p>professionals, relocation, difficulty navigating health-care delivery systems, lack of 
</p>
<p>awareness of available health resources, long waiting times for health care, diffi-
</p>
<p>culty adhering to medication, preference for traditional healers, and poor incentives 
</p>
<p>in health promotion (Kim, Bryant, Goins, Worley, &amp; Chiriboga, 2012; Moghaddam 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2013; Shah et&nbsp;al., 2014). Other factors also affect services delivery, including 
</p>
<p>gaps in state-tribal collaborations (Croff, Rieckmann, &amp; Spence, 2014; Gone &amp; 
</p>
<p>Trimble, 2012).
</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, AI/AN people have demonstrated resiliency and self- 
</p>
<p>determination over the centuries. In this chapter, we describe the current state of 
</p>
<p>behavioral health for AI/AN and the contributing factors to these disparities. We 
</p>
<p>feature some of the successes AI/AN communities have in addressing these issues.
</p>
<p>This chapter is organized by first presenting the epidemiology of behavioral dis-
</p>
<p>orders in AI/AN, including mental disorders, alcohol/drug disorders, disabilities, 
</p>
<p>and co-occurring disorders. We emphasize both risk and protective factors. We then 
</p>
<p>highlight some of the successful behavioral health prevention and treatment

</p>
<p> strategies. We conclude by discussing implications for behavioral health for AI/AN 
</p>
<p>including future directions for research, services, programs, and policy.
</p>
<p> Mental Health and&nbsp;Psychological Distress
</p>
<p>AI/AN populations are at a high risk for poor mental health outcomes. Among those 
</p>
<p>18&nbsp;years of age and older, AI/AN are more likely to experience serious psychologi-
</p>
<p>cal distress in the past 30&nbsp;days (5.4%) than their White or Black/African American 
</p>
<p>counterparts (3.4% and 3.5%, respectively) (National Center for Health Statistics 
</p>
<p>[NCHS], 2016, May). AI/AN populations are also 50% more likely to report hope-
</p>
<p>lessness, worthlessness, and feelings of nervousness or restlessness all or most of 
</p>
<p>the time compared to non-Hispanic whites and 80% more likely to report frequent 
</p>
<p>sadness (NCHS, 2016). Some researchers claim that accurate data on depression 
</p>
<p>among AI/AN elders is challenging because most AI/AN do not seek treatment for 
</p>
<p>depression and are, therefore, &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; conditions (Garrett, Baldridge, Benson, 
</p>
<p>Crowder, &amp; Aldrich, 2015). Using extrapolations from other minority data, Garrett 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al. (2015) project that AI/AN in 2050 will experience four times the rate of 
</p>
<p>depression in those over 65&nbsp;years of age and approximately four-and-a-half times 
</p>
<p>the rate of dementia as they experienced in 2010.
</p>
<p>In an analysis of gender and ethnic differences in the National Epidemiologic 
</p>
<p>Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, Brave Heart et&nbsp;al. (2016) reported that 
</p>
<p>most AI/AN men (70%) and women (63%) experienced at least one lifetime mental 
</p>
<p>disorder and were more likely to have experienced mental disorders (substance use 
</p>
<p>and mood and personality disorders) than their non-Hispanic White counterparts 
</p>
<p>(Brave Heart et&nbsp;al., 2016). The authors argue that historical trauma (e.g., boarding 
</p>
<p>school experience but more broadly genocide, ethnocide, and attempts to assimilate 
</p>
<p>into majority culture) likely contributed to unresolved grief that led to depression 
</p>
<p>and substance abuse (Brave Heart, 2003; Brave Heart et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>Historical genocide and the boarding school system have contributed to contem-
</p>
<p>porary traumatic experiences and &ldquo;multi-generational distress&rdquo; in AI/AN (Warne &amp; 
</p>
<p>Lajimodiere, 2015). For example, Myhra and Wieling (2014b) examined the impact 
</p>
<p>of trauma on the psychological well-being across two generations of AI/
</p>
<p>AN.&nbsp; Participants of both generations reported trauma from childhood, including 
</p>
<p>substance abuse and neglect, sexual or physical abuse, family violence, loss, and 
</p>
<p>death. Both generations reported past and current discrimination and racism, and 
</p>
<p>attributed their elders&rsquo; difficulties (such as substance abuse) to boarding school 
</p>
<p>experiences. Soto, Baezconde-Garbanati, Schwartz, and Unger (2015) found that 
</p>
<p>historical trauma was a risk factor for commercial tobacco use, both directly and 
</p>
<p>through several mediating factors, such as cultural activities and ethnic identity. The 
</p>
<p>impact of substance abuse complicates the effects of historical trauma, often ampli-
</p>
<p>fying negative impacts and putting users at increased risk of experiencing or inflict-
</p>
<p>ing trauma (Ehlers, Gizer, Gilder, Ellingson, &amp; Yehuda, 2013).

</p>
<p>In interviews with AI/AN elders, Grayshield, Rutherford, Salazar, Mihecoby, 
</p>
<p>and Luna (2015) explored the effects of historical trauma. The elders described 
</p>
<p>historical trauma in both individual and community levels: the disrespect and 
</p>
<p>destruction of the land and its people, boarding school abuses, and internalization of 
</p>
<p>oppression (low self-worth and negative messages about self). They believed that 
</p>
<p>the current impact of this history included alcoholism, substance abuse, food abuse 
</p>
<p>(Western foods lead to Western diseases), and a negative impact of technology. They 
</p>
<p>also reported a loss of culture and language, community discord and violence, 
</p>
<p>anger, and depression (Grayshield et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p>Other psychological stressors included poverty, poor housing, or homelessness; 
</p>
<p>lack of opportunities on reservation (compared to urban environments); and neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood safety. Parents reported more difficulties with mental health than their 
</p>
<p>adult children, which the authors suggest is attributable to parents&rsquo; efforts to protect 
</p>
<p>their children (Myhra &amp; Wieling, 2014a).
</p>
<p>Evans-Campbell, Walters, Pearson, and Campbell (2012) found that two-spirit 
</p>
<p>individuals (gay, bisexual, or transgender) who had attended boarding schools 
</p>
<p>reported higher rates of alcohol use, illicit drug use, and suicidal ideations or 
</p>
<p>attempts than those who had not attended boarding schools. Further, people with a 
</p>
<p>parent or caregiver who attended boarding school were significantly more likely to 
</p>
<p>experience suicidal ideations, generalized anxiety disorders, or post-traumatic stress 
</p>
<p>disorders than others, suggesting that boarding school attendance impacts intergen-
</p>
<p>erational health (Evans-Campbell et&nbsp;al., 2012). In other research with AI/AN indi-
</p>
<p>viduals, even having a grandparent who attended boarding school was associated 
</p>
<p>with increased risk of suicide (20.4% compared to 13.1%) (Bombay, Matheson, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Anisman, 2014).
</p>
<p> Youth
</p>
<p>American Indian/Alaska Native children experience high rates of victimization, 
</p>
<p>poverty, mental disorders, and gang involvement that impact mental well-being. 
</p>
<p>Conditions of poverty, loss of culture, and discrimination lead many AI/AN youth 
</p>
<p>to be attracted to gang activity (Hautala, Sittner Hartshorn, &amp; Whitbeck, 2016), 
</p>
<p>which is linked to higher rates of substance abuse and violence (Whitbeck, Hoyt, 
</p>
<p>Chen, &amp; Stubben, 2002). High rates of alcohol use among AI/AN youth are often 
</p>
<p>linked to historical trauma and the consequences of cultural loss at many levels 
</p>
<p>(Brown, Dickerson, &amp; D&rsquo;Amico, 2016). Among AI/AN youth in substance abuse 
</p>
<p>treatment, high rates of comorbid PTSD and alcoholism, as well as a history of 
</p>
<p>trauma, are common (Ehlers et&nbsp;al., 2013). Further, substance use is one of the lead-
</p>
<p>ing factors contributing to unintentional injuries and disabilities among AI youth 
</p>
<p>(Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, 2003).
</p>
<p>Social problems among AI/AN adolescents resulting from perceived discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion and weak social ties, particularly in urban public school settings, can contribute 
</p>
<p>to extreme alcohol and other drug consumption (Rees, Freng, &amp; Winfree Jr., 2014; 
</p>
<p>J. A. Baldwin et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>209
</p>
<p>Whitbeck, Hoyt, McMorris, Chen, &amp; Stubben, 2001). Binge alcohol use among AI/
</p>
<p>AN adolescents is often linked to family problems and aggressive behavior, suicide, 
</p>
<p>non-suicidal self-injury, and persistent problems in later life (Tingey et&nbsp;al., 2016). 
</p>
<p>Children who witness or experience household dysfunction (domestic violence, sub-
</p>
<p>stance abuse, criminal activity, and mental illness in the home), for example, are 
</p>
<p>more likely to report poor mental health outcomes (Dickerson &amp; Johnson, 2012; 
</p>
<p>Warne &amp; Lajimodiere, 2015). A higher risk for depression has been linked to how 
</p>
<p>adolescents describe life events. Negative narratives about adverse life events (e.g., 
</p>
<p>attribution of negative events to individual stupidity vs. bad luck) vs. positive (pro-
</p>
<p>tective) narratives are styles developed as early as 8th grade and underscore the need 
</p>
<p>for early intervention (Mileviciute, Trujillo, Gray, &amp; Scott, 2013). Youth receiving 
</p>
<p>mental health services in one urban clinic most frequently reported mood disorders 
</p>
<p>(41.5%), adjustment disorder (35.4%), and PTSD or acute stress (23.1%). Researchers 
</p>
<p>suggest these are linked to the pervasive effects of abuse, injustice, historical trauma, 
</p>
<p>and the loss of cultural identity (Brave Heart, 2003; Dickerson &amp; Johnson, 2012).
</p>
<p>Multiple risk factors put AI/AN youth at risk for suicidal ideation. In a study of 
</p>
<p>youths in the Midwestern USA, 9.5% reported suicidal thoughts (Yoder, Whitbeck, 
</p>
<p>Hoyt, &amp; LaFromboise, 2006). Substance use was most strongly correlated with sui-
</p>
<p>cidal thoughts, but other factors included being female, perceived discrimination, 
</p>
<p>and negative life events such as family, economic, and school-related stressors 
</p>
<p>(Yoder et&nbsp;al., 2006). Depression and poor family social support were also associated 
</p>
<p>with suicidal thoughts (Manson, Beals, Dick, &amp; Duclos, 1989). Zamora-Kapoor 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al. (2016) found that social isolation, exposure to the suicide of a friend or family 
</p>
<p>member, and being overweight were associated with suicidal ideation in both AI/
</p>
<p>AN and non-Hispanic whites. Barlow et&nbsp;al. (2012) found that 64% of youth from a 
</p>
<p>Southwest tribe, particularly males, were intoxicated at the time of suicide and 75% 
</p>
<p>of those who had attempted suicide were intoxicated at the time. Alcohol was the 
</p>
<p>most commonly reported source of intoxication in suicidal acts, and peer pressure 
</p>
<p>was also cited as a contributing factor.
</p>
<p>Deviant peers appear to influence delinquency and substance use behaviors 
</p>
<p>among AI/AN youth (Rees et&nbsp;al., 2014). AI/AN youth experience more disability- 
</p>
<p>based harassment and gender-based harassment compared to youth from other racial 
</p>
<p>or ethnic groups (Bucchianeri, Gower, McMorris, &amp; Eisenberg, 2016). However, 
</p>
<p>Tingey et&nbsp;al. (2016) report that strong ethnic identity, connection to cultural values, 
</p>
<p>and positive family and peer influences are protective factors among AI/AN youth 
</p>
<p>against substance use disorders (Mmari, Blum, &amp; Teufel-Shone, 2010).
</p>
<p> Gender, Sexual Orientation, and&nbsp;Violence
</p>
<p>American Indian women are more likely to be victims of violent crime than women 
</p>
<p>of other ethnicities (Walters &amp; Simoni, 2002) and to develop psychiatric symptoms 
</p>
<p>due to trauma and their sequelae. Sexual violence against AI/AN women is espe-
</p>
<p>cially deleterious. Based on the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence

</p>
<p>Survey, 2011, the lifetime prevalence of rape in AI/AN women is 27.5%, with 
</p>
<p>another 55% reporting other forms of sexual violence (Breiding et&nbsp;al., 2014). In AI/
</p>
<p>AN women aged 15&ndash;35 living on or near a reservation, exposure to trauma was 
</p>
<p>associated with symptoms of PTSD, substance use, and risky sexual behavior. 
</p>
<p>Those with high trauma exposure who met the criteria for PTSD were at greater risk 
</p>
<p>for binge drinking and risky sexual behaviors that increased their risk for HIV 
</p>
<p>(Pearson et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p>There is evidence that AI/ANs who identify as gay, bisexual, or transgendered 
</p>
<p>(&ldquo;two-spirit&rdquo; individuals) experience disproportionately higher rates of both anti- 
</p>
<p>Native and anti-gay discrimination and violence, particularly sexual violence in 
</p>
<p>urban settings (Fieland, Walters, &amp; Simoni, 2007; Lehavot, Walters, &amp; Simoni, 
</p>
<p>2009). Two-spirit AI/AN women are at particular risk for substance abuse and men-
</p>
<p>tal health challenges such as PTSD due to their &ldquo;multiple minority oppressed sta-
</p>
<p>tus&rdquo; (Elm, Lewis, Walters, &amp; Self, 2016, p.&nbsp; 352). Among two-spirit AI/AN, 
</p>
<p>consequences of emotional trauma were exacerbated by boarding school attendance 
</p>
<p>(Evans-Campbell et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>Both AI/AN females and males experience high rates of intimate partner vio-
</p>
<p>lence, usually before the age of 25. Among Native women, 51.7% reported physical 
</p>
<p>violence, and 63.8% reported psychological aggression in intimate relationships 
</p>
<p>(Breiding et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p>In a study of 18- to 45-year-old women at an IHS hospital, intimate partner vio-
</p>
<p>lence was strongly associated with subsequent mood disorder (Stockman, Hayashi, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Campbell, 2015). Although 43% of Native men reported physical violence in 
</p>
<p>their relationships, reports of psychological aggression were less frequent than in 
</p>
<p>most other ethnicities (Breiding et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p> Veterans
</p>
<p>Both rural and urban AI/AN veterans experience poor mental health from combat 
</p>
<p>experience, most commonly depression and mood and other anxiety disorders 
</p>
<p>(Westermeyer &amp; Canive, 2013), and more lifetime PTSD than their white counter-
</p>
<p>parts (Beals et&nbsp;al., 2002; Westermeyer &amp; Canive, 2013). Among AI/ANs who served 
</p>
<p>in the military, almost half report some type of disability associated with their ser-
</p>
<p>vice and identified their substance use problems as resulting from military service 
</p>
<p>(Harada, Villa, Reifel, &amp; Bayhylle, 2005). In a nationally representative sample of 
</p>
<p>US veterans, Smith, Goldstein, and Grant (2016) found a higher prevalence of life-
</p>
<p>time PTSD in AI/ANs (24.1%) than among Blacks (11%) or Whites (5.97%). In 
</p>
<p>addition, AI/ANs are overrepresented among veterans who are homeless (making 
</p>
<p>up 1.6% of veterans but 19% of the homeless veteran population) and experience 
</p>
<p>higher rates of hospitalization for alcohol dependence than any other veteran group 
</p>
<p>(Kasprow &amp; Rosenheck, 1998).
</p>
<p>Difficulty navigating the complex system of the Veterans Administration exacer-
</p>
<p>bates stress in veterans and their families (Kaufman et&nbsp;al., 2016). This is particularly

</p>
<p>true on reservation lands that lack culturally competent care and transportation to 
</p>
<p>access services (AlMasarweh &amp; Ward, 2016).
</p>
<p> Suicide
</p>
<p>Suicide is one of the most serious outcomes of severe mental distress in AI/AN.&nbsp;In 
</p>
<p>2014, the second highest US rate of suicide was among AI/AN males (16.4 per 
</p>
<p>100,000) (NCHS, 2016). The highest rates of suicide in Native men occurred among 
</p>
<p>those 15&ndash;24&nbsp;years and 25&ndash;44&nbsp;years (23.5 and 26.2 per 100,000, respectively). Native 
</p>
<p>women completed suicide at lower rates than their male counter parts (5.5 per 
</p>
<p>100,000 overall), but those between 15 and 24&nbsp;years of age were almost twice as 
</p>
<p>likely to complete suicide as non-Hispanic whites of the same age (NCHS, 2016). 
</p>
<p>Two-spirit women who attended boarding school were six times more likely to 
</p>
<p>report suicidal thoughts than those who did not attend boarding school and almost 
</p>
<p>nine times more likely to attempt suicide (Evans-Campbell et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>Veteran suicide is increasing for all groups, especially for AI/AN.&nbsp;In addition to 
</p>
<p>a lack of connectedness and sense of burden on family (if the veteran lived), 
</p>
<p>Chiurliza, Michaels, and Joiner (2016) found higher rates of suicide risk in AI/AN 
</p>
<p>compared to other ethnicities through consideration of an &ldquo;acquired capability for 
</p>
<p>suicide (i.e., a diminished fear of death and increased pain tolerance)&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;3), a qual-
</p>
<p>ity that should be considered in suicide prevention at all levels of military service.
</p>
<p> Substance Use in&nbsp;AI/AN Communities
</p>
<p>AI/ANs have the highest rates of substance abuse of any racial/ethnic group in the 
</p>
<p>USA, with rates of alcoholism and illicit drug use two to five times higher than the 
</p>
<p>general population (Ehlers, Liang, &amp; Gizer, 2012; Currie, Wild, Schopflocher, 
</p>
<p>Laing, &amp; Veugelers, 2013; Steen, 2015). Substance use is a principle causal factor 
</p>
<p>in continued poor health outcomes in AI/AN communities. The IHS views the con-
</p>
<p>sequences of substance abuse as the root of the most urgent health problems in AI/
</p>
<p>AN communities (Ehlers et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>AI/AN youth use tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substances at higher rates than 
</p>
<p>adolescents of any other racial/ethnic group (Steen, 2015). Use is often initiated at 
</p>
<p>younger ages compared to substance use debut in other groups (Brown et&nbsp;al., 2016; 
</p>
<p>Whitesell et&nbsp;al., 2014). Stanley et&nbsp;al. (2014) found high prevalence rates for almost 
</p>
<p>every substance, particularly marijuana, binge alcohol use, and OxyContin, among 
</p>
<p>AI/AN as young as 8th grade. Dickerson and Johnson (2012) found that alcohol and 
</p>
<p>marijuana were the most common substances used among a cohort of AI/AN youth. 
</p>
<p>However, AI/AN youth also report relatively high rates of amphetamine/stimulant 
</p>
<p>use, narcotic pain medication use, cocaine, tobacco, inhalants, hallucinogens, stim-

</p>
<p>ulant prescription medications, and over-the-counter medications (Barlow et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2010; Dickerson &amp; Johnson, 2012).
</p>
<p>Gender differences in substance use among AI/ANs vary by region and urban 
</p>
<p>versus rural location. There is some evidence that substance abuse, such as meth-
</p>
<p>amphetamine and opioid analgesic use, is more prevalent among AI/AN women 
</p>
<p>than men (Forcehimes et&nbsp;al., 2011). One study conducted in Los Angeles County 
</p>
<p>found more AI/AN women seeking treatment for methamphetamine use than men 
</p>
<p>(Spear, Crevecoeur, Rawson, &amp; Clark, 2007); however, other research has found 
</p>
<p>methamphetamine use to be more common among men (Iritani, Hallfors, &amp; Bauer, 
</p>
<p>2007). AI/AN men have some of the highest substance use rates of any racial or 
</p>
<p>ethnic group (O&rsquo;Connell, Novins, Beals, &amp; Spicer, 2005; Whitesell, Beals, Crow, 
</p>
<p>Mitchell, &amp; Novins, 2012). High rates of alcohol use among AI/AN men lead to 
</p>
<p>intergenerational issues such as difficulty establishing positive fatherhood roles 
</p>
<p>(Neault et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>AI/AN women have one of the highest rates of drug-related mortality of any 
</p>
<p>racial/ethnic group (up to 44 per 100,000&nbsp;in 45&ndash;54 age category) (Walters &amp; Simoni, 
</p>
<p>2002). In a study of female students attending tribal colleges, Schultz (2016) found 
</p>
<p>that most women (62%) had used drugs at least once during their lifetime. In an 
</p>
<p>urban sample, two-spirit individuals (gay, bisexual, or transgendered) were more 
</p>
<p>likely to report being victimized or engaging in high-risk behaviors as a result of 
</p>
<p>substance use (Simoni, Walters, Balsam, &amp; Meyers, 2006). Two-spirit individuals 
</p>
<p>also reported higher rates of mental health service utilization, higher rates of alcohol 
</p>
<p>use, and higher rates of illicit drug use than other participants (Balsam, Huang, 
</p>
<p>Fieland, Simoni, &amp; Walters, 2004).
</p>
<p>Although substance abuse is a major problem facing many AI/AN communities, 
</p>
<p>there are major regional differences in substance abuse and related disorders 
</p>
<p>between, for example, Southwest and Great Plains communities (Etz, Arroyo, 
</p>
<p>Crump, Rosa, &amp; Scott, 2012; Volkow &amp; Warren, 2012). To understand substance 
</p>
<p>abuse in both current and historical context, nuances and contextual factors influ-
</p>
<p>encing substance use in varied AI/AN populations must be considered (Etz et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2012). Although many cultural, social, economic, and contextual factors contribute 
</p>
<p>to high rates of substance use, many strengths and sources of resilience among AI/
</p>
<p>AN communities, such as strong cultural traditions, family support, and cultural 
</p>
<p>pride, also contribute to abstinence and to mitigating the effects of substance abuse 
</p>
<p>(LaFromboise, Hoyt, Oliver, &amp; Whitbeck, 2006).
</p>
<p> Alcohol Use
</p>
<p>Alcohol use is extremely prevalent in AI/AN communities, with lifetime prevalence 
</p>
<p>of 96% for men and 92% for women by the time they finish 12th grade (Walters &amp; 
</p>
<p>Simoni, 2002). AI/AN have the highest rates of admission for substance use disor-
</p>
<p>ders in general, and they are more likely to report alcohol as the primary substance 
</p>
<p>used than any other racial or ethnic group (Greenfield &amp; Venner, 2012). Mortality 
</p>
<p>J. A. Baldwin et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>213
</p>
<p>resulting from alcohol use is much higher among AI/ANs than non-AI/ANs (Evans- 
</p>
<p>Campbell et&nbsp;al., 2012), although mortality also varies considerably by region, with 
</p>
<p>some of the highest rates in the Northern Plains and lowest in the Eastern USA 
</p>
<p>(Landen, Roeber, Naimi, Nielsen, &amp; Sewell, 2014). AI/AN people who use alcohol 
</p>
<p>face an elevated risk of both mental and physical health consequences, including 
</p>
<p>physical and sexual violence, accidents from intoxicated driving, and chronic health 
</p>
<p>issues (Landen et&nbsp;al., 2014; Whitesell et&nbsp;al., 2012; Yuan et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Research suggests that AI/ANs display higher rates of abstinence from alcohol 
</p>
<p>than the general population (Cunningham, Solomon, &amp; Muramoto, 2016); however, 
</p>
<p>adults who do engage in alcohol use often engage in heavier or binge use (O&rsquo;Connell 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2005; Whitesell et&nbsp;al., 2012). Reservation-based populations exhibit greater 
</p>
<p>abstinence than urban AI/AN populations, perhaps in part because many reserva-
</p>
<p>tions prohibit the use and sale of alcohol within their borders (Landen et&nbsp;al., 2014; 
</p>
<p>Walters, Simoni, &amp; Evans-Campbell, 2002).
</p>
<p>Considerable efforts to uncover genetic predispositions to alcoholism among AI/
</p>
<p>ANs have been unsuccessful, suggesting that social factors are largely responsible 
</p>
<p>for elevated rates (Ehlers et&nbsp;al., 2012). Alcohol was not introduced into AI/AN com-
</p>
<p>munities until European colonization, and thus there are strong negative associa-
</p>
<p>tions with its use. In qualitative interviews with AI/AN people, Spicer (2001) found 
</p>
<p>that both drinkers and non-drinkers described alcohol use as incompatible with AI/
</p>
<p>AN worldviews and morality. AI/AN communities, however, report several dilem-
</p>
<p>mas related to the embeddedness of alcohol use in many aspects of current social 
</p>
<p>and cultural life (Yuan et&nbsp;al., 2010). Quintero (2001) argues that looking uncritically 
</p>
<p>at AI/AN patterns of alcohol use without considering historical and contemporary 
</p>
<p>contexts of discrimination and disadvantage faced by AI/AN peoples serves to 
</p>
<p>reproduce colonialist images and perpetuates disadvantage among AI/AN people 
</p>
<p>through the preservation of negative stereotypes.
</p>
<p> Tobacco Use
</p>
<p>According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 
</p>
<p>2005 and 2013, AI/AN people used tobacco at higher rates than all other US popula-
</p>
<p>tions except individuals reporting multiple races (Jamal et&nbsp;al., 2014). Smoking is 
</p>
<p>also more common among males and among people living in poverty (Jamal et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2014). AI/AN youth have the highest rates of commercial tobacco use in the USA 
</p>
<p>(Unger, Soto, &amp; Baezconde-Garbanati, 2006), and early tobacco use is often associ-
</p>
<p>ated with stress or exposure to trauma and negative peer influences (Whitesell et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2014). AI/AN smokers are consistently more likely to drink heavily than non- 
</p>
<p>smokers (Ryan, Cooke, &amp; Leatherdale, 2016), and although tobacco use varies con-
</p>
<p>siderably by region, related health consequences tend to be disproportionately 
</p>
<p>higher in AI/AN communities (Whitesell et&nbsp;al., 2012).

</p>
<p> Illicit Drug Use
</p>
<p>AI/AN communities have high rates of use for a range of illicit substances, includ-
</p>
<p>ing stimulants (Gilder, Gizer, Lau, &amp; Ehlers, 2014), inhalants (Stockman et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2015), prescription medications (Katzman et&nbsp;al., 2016; Momper, Delva, Tauiliili, 
</p>
<p>Mueller-Williams, &amp; Goral, 2013; Wu, Pilowsky, &amp; Patkar, 2008), and increasingly 
</p>
<p>methamphetamines (Brown, 2010; Forcehimes et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p>Use of opioid analgesics for non-medical reasons is higher among AI/ANs than 
</p>
<p>among Caucasians (6.2% and 5.6%, respectively) (Katzman et&nbsp;al., 2016). AI/AN 
</p>
<p>people experience higher rates of accidental overdose as a result of opioid use 
</p>
<p>(15.7% vs 14.7%) (Hirchak &amp; Murphy, 2017). Among AI/AN adolescents, past year 
</p>
<p>hospitalization or multiple arrests, as well as low family income and being treated 
</p>
<p>for psychological problems, are associated with increased use of non-prescribed 
</p>
<p>opioids (Wu et&nbsp;al., 2008).
</p>
<p>Use of methamphetamines (MA) has been increasing in AI/AN communities 
</p>
<p>(Forcehimes et&nbsp;al., 2011). Rural and reservation-dwelling AI/AN communities have 
</p>
<p>experienced rates of stimulant dependence as high as 33%. Rural areas, including 
</p>
<p>many American Indian reservations, are particularly attractive for MA production 
</p>
<p>due to geographic isolation, poverty, and sparse law enforcement (Glover-Kerkvliet, 
</p>
<p>2009). Health disparities and vulnerability of AI/AN communities have been com-
</p>
<p>pounded by the MA crisis, with a broad range of health risks from dental and skin 
</p>
<p>disorders to accidental poisoning of children, increases in crime, domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>and child neglect/abuse (Glover-Kerkvliet, 2009; Spear et&nbsp;al., 2007).
</p>
<p> Multi-Substance Use Disorders
</p>
<p>Multi-substance use disorder impacts AI/AN communities disproportionately and 
</p>
<p>those using multiple substances with alcohol experience symptoms of alcohol- related 
</p>
<p>problems at higher rates than those who use alcohol alone (Gilder, Stouffer, Lau, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ehlers, 2016). Use of multiple drugs in combination with alcohol use has been asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with increases in the rates of DSM-3R alcohol dependence disorders (Kunitz, 
</p>
<p>2008). In a study of Alaska Natives, the majority of alcohol users also used other 
</p>
<p>substances, with the most common being marijuana, followed by cocaine and opiates 
</p>
<p>(Malcolm, Hesselbrock, &amp; Segal, 2006). Those who experience multi-substance use 
</p>
<p>disorders often initiate drug and alcohol use at earlier ages and experience academic 
</p>
<p>failure and other social difficulties (Gilder et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p> Disability and&nbsp;Substance Use
</p>
<p>National estimates of disability status in 2014 found that 1&nbsp;in 5 US adults have some 
</p>
<p>type of disability. Among US adults, AI/ANs have the highest prevalence of experi-
</p>
<p>encing any disability (35.5%) compared to all other racial and ethnic groups. AI/
</p>
<p>J. A. Baldwin et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>215
</p>
<p>ANs also have the highest prevalence of cognitive disability (19.4%), mobility dis-
</p>
<p>ability (19.7%), vision disability (9%), self-care disability (6.3%), and independent 
</p>
<p>living disability (12.3%) compared to all other racial/ethnic groups (Okoro, Hollis, 
</p>
<p>Cyrus, &amp; Griffin-Blake, 2018).
</p>
<p>The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome is highest among AI/AN children as a 
</p>
<p>result of higher alcohol use among AI/AN women (Fox et&nbsp;al., 2015). High rates of 
</p>
<p>alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy among AI/AN mothers (3 times and 1.5 
</p>
<p>times the national rate, respectively) also contribute to high rates of infant mortality 
</p>
<p>in AI/AN populations (Walters et&nbsp;al., 2002).
</p>
<p>Among AI/ANs with disabilities, drug use increases as disability severity 
</p>
<p>increases (Grant et&nbsp;al., 2016). AI/AN males and females with disabilities have the 
</p>
<p>highest prevalence of smoking as compared to other race/ethnic groups with dis-
</p>
<p>abilities. Lower education levels among AI/AN adults with disabilities contribute to 
</p>
<p>increased nicotine use (Courtney-Long, Romano, Carroll, &amp; Fox, 2017). Also, AI/
</p>
<p>AN males with disabilities are more likely to binge drink or engage in heavy drink-
</p>
<p>ing (Okoro et&nbsp;al., 2007). AI/ANs with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are more likely 
</p>
<p>to experience substance use disorders (Nelson, Rhoades, Noonan, &amp; Manson, 2007).
</p>
<p> Prevention, Intervention, and&nbsp;Treatment
</p>
<p>Successful prevention, intervention, and treatment of behavioral health concerns in 
</p>
<p>AI/AN populations are constrained by several barriers to services delivery. Difficulty 
</p>
<p>of diagnosing mental health conditions, lack of access to treatment services, funding 
</p>
<p>limitations, and stigma toward mental health impose barriers to appropriate treatment 
</p>
<p>and care (Johnson &amp; Cameron, 2001). One key barrier to designing and implement-
</p>
<p>ing effective treatment programs is that Western biomedical definitions of mental 
</p>
<p>health and treatment are poorly aligned with AI/AN understandings of wellness and 
</p>
<p>healing (Gone, 2008; Hartmann &amp; Gone, 2012). Divergent models of health and ill-
</p>
<p>ness pose barriers to providing adequate and culturally resonant treatment for mental 
</p>
<p>health (Gone, 2016). Many AI/AN communities&rsquo; understandings of mental health are 
</p>
<p>incongruent with Western biomedical therapies (Office of the Surgeon General, 
</p>
<p>2001), and attempts to treat AI/AN patients from within biomedical paradigms are 
</p>
<p>often perceived as colonialistic or even as &ldquo;brainwashing&rdquo; by AI/AN patients (Gone, 
</p>
<p>2016, p.&nbsp;2).
</p>
<p>Despite the reported prevalence of traumatic experience among AI/AN individu-
</p>
<p>als, few seek treatment for trauma due to limited access to mental health services 
</p>
<p>and fear of stigma and discrimination (United States Commission on Civil Rights, 
</p>
<p>2004). Gurley et&nbsp;al. (2001) found that although 75% of AI/AN veterans reported a 
</p>
<p>mental health or substance abuse problem, PTSD, and alcohol abuse, fewer than 
</p>
<p>20% of these veterans sought mental health care and more commonly sought care 
</p>
<p>for physical health concerns. Fears of stigma and discrimination when accessing 
</p>
<p>mental health services present major barriers to improving behavioral health, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly among AI/AN youth.
</p>
<p>The Behavioral Health of&nbsp;American Indian/Alaska Native Populations: Risk&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216
</p>
<p>Research suggests that nearly half of AI/AN individuals diagnosed with mental 
</p>
<p>illness seek treatment from traditional medical practitioners. Traditional medical 
</p>
<p>services are often sought for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Walls, Johnson, 
</p>
<p>Whitbeck, and Hoyt (2006) found that American Indian parents/caregivers strongly 
</p>
<p>prefer traditional cultural services for mental health and substance abuse problems 
</p>
<p>rather than formal behavioral health services and believe that these services are 
</p>
<p>more effective. Increased anxiety, spiritual engagement, and past experiences with 
</p>
<p>discrimination in health care were also associated with a preference for a traditional 
</p>
<p>approach to care (Aronson, Johnson-Jennings, Kading, Smith, &amp; Walls, 2016).
</p>
<p>Other known barriers to care include geography, particularly access to services 
</p>
<p>located in rural and remote locations, poverty, transportation, and an inadequate 
</p>
<p>number of qualified treatment providers (Goodkind et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>School-based prevention programs have become an increasingly popular means 
</p>
<p>to enhance access to prevention services. These programs, which are located in 
</p>
<p>tribal affiliated and public schools, have primarily focused on alcohol and drug pre-
</p>
<p>vention (Middlebrook, LeMaster, Beals, Novins, &amp; Manson, 2001).
</p>
<p>In order to assess whether existing prevention and treatment services are effec-
</p>
<p>tively meeting the mental health needs of individuals suffering from mental health 
</p>
<p>conditions, there has been an increasing call for integrating evidence-based prac-
</p>
<p>tices (EBPs) with these services. Behind the draw of EBP has been the desire to 
</p>
<p>provide all individuals with quality care that has been scientifically validated to 
</p>
<p>demonstrate effectiveness (Walker, Whitener, Trupin, &amp; Migliarini, 2015). However, 
</p>
<p>concerns have been raised that few studies have evaluated these programs using 
</p>
<p>rigorous methods. Further, given the small size of the AI/AN population, AI/AN 
</p>
<p>patients have been poorly represented in many studies. As a result, these studies fail 
</p>
<p>to include large samples that would generate the reliability and validity characteris-
</p>
<p>tic of rigorous methods (Walker et&nbsp;al., 2015). Many AI/AN communities perceive 
</p>
<p>EBP standards as incongruent with their values and a challenge to tribal sover-
</p>
<p>eignty. Demonstrating the effectiveness of culturally adapted programs has been 
</p>
<p>particularly challenging due to the limited representation of AI/AN communities in 
</p>
<p>efficacy trials.
</p>
<p> Ethnic Identity and&nbsp;Culturally Appropriate Approaches 
</p>
<p>to&nbsp;Prevention and&nbsp;Healing
</p>
<p>In recent years, scholars have turned to culturally adapted interventions to increase 
</p>
<p>the effectiveness of prevention and treatment programs in diverse populations 
</p>
<p>(Griner &amp; Smith, 2006). Culturally adapted mental health interventions tailored to a 
</p>
<p>specific ethnic population are up to four times more effective than traditional health 
</p>
<p>interventions (Castro, Barrera, &amp; Holleran Steiker, 2010). These interventions inte-
</p>
<p>grate key values, practices, and ideals within the community into intervention 
</p>
<p>design and implementation. Griner and Smith (2006) found that interventions that 
</p>
<p>use indigenous language are twice as effective as those conducted in English.
</p>
<p>J. A. Baldwin et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>217
</p>
<p>Often called culturally sensitive interventions (CSIs), these programs incorpo-
</p>
<p>rate Native values, norms, beliefs, and practices into the design, implementation, 
</p>
<p>and evaluation of the intervention. The underlying premise of CSIs is that interven-
</p>
<p>tion methods that align with the values, beliefs, practices, and norms of the target 
</p>
<p>population increase access, promote engagement, and may be more effective 
</p>
<p>(Jackson &amp; Hodge, 2010). By defining health and wellness as balance within the 
</p>
<p>individual and community, these interventions embrace a holistic perspective, inte-
</p>
<p>grating prevention and treatment strategies that promote both individual and com-
</p>
<p>munity well-being. Many of these programs draw upon the knowledge and expertise 
</p>
<p>of Native community members who play a key role in designing and administering 
</p>
<p>the intervention (LaFromboise &amp; Howard-Pitney, 1995).
</p>
<p>Many substance abuse prevention programs foster participation in community 
</p>
<p>service to reinforce key AI/AN values of family, service, respect, and spirituality. 
</p>
<p>The National Indian Youth Leadership Project, deemed a model program by the 
</p>
<p>Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, emphasizes community service while pro-
</p>
<p>moting skill development in the areas of problem-solving and wilderness education 
</p>
<p>(Carter, Straits, &amp; Hall, 2007).
</p>
<p>To heal from the impact of historical trauma and increase mental well-being, AI/
</p>
<p>AN elders advocate for combatting negative narratives about self through increased 
</p>
<p>awareness, education, and a return to culture and spiritual ways (Garrett et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2015). Elders also emphasize the importance of language, cultural identity, spiritu-
</p>
<p>ality, tradition, and family support in building both individual and community resil-
</p>
<p>ience but call for changes in social, political, and economic resources to move 
</p>
<p>communities forward (Reinschmidt, Attakai, Kahn, Whitewater, &amp; Teufel-Shone, 
</p>
<p>2016). Families and communities that participate in the healing can regain strengths 
</p>
<p>and positive qualities of being American Indian (Garrett et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p>Ethnic identity is especially significant for AI/AN youth and has had a positive 
</p>
<p>influence on self-esteem and future optimism, which affects mental health. Higher 
</p>
<p>self-esteem is associated with a decreased risk for depression, anxiety, and external-
</p>
<p>izing behaviors, such as fighting or breaking rules at school and home (Smokowski, 
</p>
<p>Evans, Cotter, &amp; Webber, 2014).
</p>
<p>Participation in ceremonies and other traditional activities and supporting com-
</p>
<p>munity cohesion, even in an urban environment, are critical to successful  intervention 
</p>
<p>(Hartmann &amp; Gone, 2012). Programs that incorporate a balance of mind, body, 
</p>
<p>spirit, and context (including community building and family support) have proved 
</p>
<p>successful in helping adolescents overcome the impact of both historical and con-
</p>
<p>temporary oppression in the urban setting and to make a successful transition to 
</p>
<p>adulthood (Friesen et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Suggestions for future research to improve behavioral health among AI/AN include 
</p>
<p>integrating prevention and treatment services, addressing the role of stress in mental 
</p>
<p>health, embracing a holistic perspective for behavioral health, integrating Western 
</p>
<p>The Behavioral Health of&nbsp;American Indian/Alaska Native Populations: Risk&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>218
</p>
<p>biomedical and traditional AI/AN healing approaches, and acknowledging the role 
</p>
<p>of historical social and cultural inequities that contribute to poor behavioral health 
</p>
<p>outcomes (Goodkind et&nbsp;al., 2010). While Western biomedical approaches measure 
</p>
<p>the success of substance abuse prevention with outcomes such as sobriety, tradi-
</p>
<p>tional healing focuses on outcomes rooted in spiritual beliefs and practices, such as 
</p>
<p>an individual&rsquo;s notion of spiritual connection and sense of belonging within the 
</p>
<p>community. Spiritual ties to traditional Native American beliefs have been found to 
</p>
<p>be particularly protective against suicide attempts (Garroutte, Goldberg, Beals, 
</p>
<p>Herrell, &amp; Manson, 2003).
</p>
<p>Therefore, research should be based from Indigenous worldviews and perspec-
</p>
<p>tives using community-engaged approaches. Community members should be 
</p>
<p>involved in the research from its conception to implementation to dissemination of 
</p>
<p>results (Baldwin, Johnson, &amp; Benally, 2009). Tribal, cultural, and linguistic diver-
</p>
<p>sity needs to be considered throughout all phases of the research process. Culturally 
</p>
<p>appropriate evaluation tools need to be validated and used to determine effective-
</p>
<p>ness of programs (Caldwell et&nbsp; al., 2005). Finally, we need to build capacity for 
</p>
<p>community members to design and oversee research projects in their own commu-
</p>
<p>nities. More funding should be directed to train Native students and community 
</p>
<p>members in behavioral health services research.
</p>
<p> Services
</p>
<p>Many would argue that to see reductions in behavioral health disparities among AI/
</p>
<p>AN, there must be a &ldquo;genuine transformation of systems of care&rdquo; (Goodkind et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2010, p.&nbsp;391). System factors might include finding ways to reimburse healers for 
</p>
<p>care, supporting behavioral health systems to address historical trauma and contem-
</p>
<p>porary stressors, and creating alternative licensing and credentialing for AI/AN ser-
</p>
<p>vice providers. An excellent example is provided by the Alaska Native Tribal Health 
</p>
<p>Consortium that has developed and implemented a Behavioral Health Aide Program 
</p>
<p>(Goodkind et&nbsp;al., 2010). The program trains and certifies behavioral health workers 
</p>
<p>to address mental health and substance abuse in Alaska Native villages and has met 
</p>
<p>with significant success. There is also a need for providers to be trained in behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health cultural competency to first understand their own culture and how it 
</p>
<p>impacts their practice (Gone, 2007). Finally, LaFromboise et&nbsp;al. (2006) argue that 
</p>
<p>Western therapeutic approaches are too individually focused and discredit the ben-
</p>
<p>efits of traditional Native healing.
</p>
<p> Programs
</p>
<p>Increasingly, AI/AN communities are seeking culturally appropriate strategies to 
</p>
<p>address the high rates of substance dependence, trauma, and violence that they are 
</p>
<p>facing (Hartmann &amp; Gone, 2012). The diverse worldviews of AI/AN communities 
</p>
<p>J. A. Baldwin et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>219
</p>
<p>often do not fit neatly into Western biomedical paradigms, leading to underutiliza-
</p>
<p>tion of biomedical treatment among AI/ANs even in urban areas (Hartmann &amp; 
</p>
<p>Gone, 2012). In a review of the use of AI/AN traditional healing in urban communi-
</p>
<p>ties, Hartmann and Gone (2012) reported that participation in traditional healing 
</p>
<p>activities led to stronger ethnocultural identity as well as community support, politi-
</p>
<p>cal empowerment, and resilience strategies for AI/AN communities. Walls, 
</p>
<p>Whitbeck, and Armenta (2016) caution, however, that while indigenous spirituality 
</p>
<p>was associated with poorer psychological outcomes, the effect was attenuated by 
</p>
<p>controlling for moderating factors such as perceived discrimination and historical 
</p>
<p>losses.
</p>
<p>Emphasis on AI/AN culture and wellness ideals is a means of preventing sub-
</p>
<p>stance abuse in AI/AN populations (Brown et&nbsp;al., 2016). Numerous treatment and 
</p>
<p>prevention programs based on Native worldviews have demonstrated success, such 
</p>
<p>as talking circles, family-based interventions, criminal sentences that incorporate 
</p>
<p>traditional practices, and traditional ceremonies such as sweat lodge and drumming 
</p>
<p>ceremonies (Greenfield &amp; Venner, 2012; The National Congress of American 
</p>
<p>Indians, 2006, November).
</p>
<p>Strong cultural traditions, family and clan networks, and cultural beliefs sur-
</p>
<p>rounding abstinence in AI/AN communities serve as protective and resilience 
</p>
<p>promoting factors (Barlow et&nbsp; al., 2012). Prevention and treatment programs 
</p>
<p>should emphasize family values and tribal cohesion to reduce the sense of isola-
</p>
<p>tion and cultural disconnection reported by many AI/AN drinkers (Yuan et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2010). Also, research suggests that substance abuse prevention programs must 
</p>
<p>target youth at early ages and account for the impacts of stress and exposure to 
</p>
<p>traumatic events (Whitesell et&nbsp;al., 2014). Culturally relevant programs that incor-
</p>
<p>porate mental health and substance abuse treatment can benefit both rural reserva-
</p>
<p>tion-based and urban American Indian communities (Currie et&nbsp;al., 2013; Dickerson 
</p>
<p>&amp; Johnson, 2012).
</p>
<p> Policy
</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to discuss the policy implications associated with the behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health needs of AI/AN communities. Behavioral health services can be 
</p>
<p>accessed through a variety of sources including private insurance, Medicaid, Indian 
</p>
<p>Health Services, state and local funds, discretionary grants from state and federal 
</p>
<p>resources, and Tribal funds (Office of Clinical and Preventive Services, 2011). Each 
</p>
<p>of these funding options comes with its own policy implications, as each will be 
</p>
<p>overseen by a variety of governmental groups including local, state, tribal, and fed-
</p>
<p>eral governing bodies.
</p>
<p>Tribal governments operate as sovereign nations and have power of authority 
</p>
<p>over programs and services related to the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens 
</p>
<p>similar to state governments (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2016). It is 
</p>
<p>recommended that intergovernmental agreements including partnerships between 
</p>
<p>The Behavioral Health of&nbsp;American Indian/Alaska Native Populations: Risk&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>220
</p>
<p>state and tribal governments occur when planning for resources (National Conference 
</p>
<p>of State Legislatures, 2016). Ongoing collaboration between federal, tribal, and 
</p>
<p>state programs with a focus on cultural practices, traditional approaches, and com-
</p>
<p>munity-healing will support sustainable policy solutions and mutual respect between 
</p>
<p>partners (National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, 2015; 
</p>
<p>Office of Clinical and Preventive Services, 2011).
</p>
<p>Tribal representatives should be involved in developing policy in the early stages 
</p>
<p>of policy conceptualization (Willging et&nbsp;al., 2012). Using a CBPR approach to facil-
</p>
<p>itate discussions regarding policy changes can facilitate trust and also commitment 
</p>
<p>to implement proposed policy reforms (Blanchard, Petherick, &amp; Basara, 2015). Any 
</p>
<p>policy-based initiatives to reform behavioral health services should include enough 
</p>
<p>flexibility to provide culturally sound services. Policies supporting behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services can also emerge from efforts to implement culturally relevant 
</p>
<p>evidence- based programs (EBPs). For example, the Suquamish community adapted 
</p>
<p>EBPs to establish a mental health program titled Healthy and Whole. Based on the 
</p>
<p>successes of the Healthy and Whole program, the Suquamish Tribal Council devel-
</p>
<p>oped policies to promote sustainability of the program (Kinsey &amp; Reed, 2015).
</p>
<p>At the federal level, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
</p>
<p>Administration (2017, December 21) acknowledges the importance and necessity 
</p>
<p>for tribal consultation in all of their efforts to support trust, respect, and shared 
</p>
<p>responsibility. In 2007, they developed a SAMSHA-Specific Tribal Consultation 
</p>
<p>Policy (TCP) which outlines their consultation processes. The Substance Abuse and 
</p>
<p>Mental Health Services Administration also provides technical assistance resources 
</p>
<p>for working with Tribal groups and has several funding opportunities focused on 
</p>
<p>behavioral health issues specific to AI/AN groups (SAMHSA, 2017, December 21). 
</p>
<p>The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) included the Indian 
</p>
<p>Health Care Improvement Reauthorization and Extension Act (IHCIA) in which 
</p>
<p>Title VII called for a comprehensive behavioral health service initiatives in Indian 
</p>
<p>Country (Office of Clinical and Preventive Services, 2011). Policies supporting 
</p>
<p>integration of primary care and behavioral health support a holistic approach to care 
</p>
<p>which aligns with traditional tribal healing practices (Office of Clinical and 
</p>
<p>Preventive Services, 2011).
</p>
<p>At the local, state, and tribal levels, there are also opportunities to reform policies 
</p>
<p>to support more culturally relevant care. Policy efforts supported by local tribal 
</p>
<p>groups resulted in the Arizona Medicaid program received approval for their Section 
</p>
<p>1115 Waiver in which Medicaid will now reimburse for Tribal-based Traditional 
</p>
<p>Healing Services (Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, 2016). Local and 
</p>
<p>tribal groups can also work with IHS to establish a community health representative 
</p>
<p>(CHR) work force through their local IHS offices (Old Elk, 2016, October, 31). 
</p>
<p>Community health representatives are members of local tribal communities who 
</p>
<p>know the local culture, can serve as advocates, and can also provide needed cultur-
</p>
<p>ally sound behavioral health services.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the AI/AN communities experience higher rates of a variety 
</p>
<p>of behavioral health conditions than other US populations, there are opportunities 
</p>
<p>through culturally relevant and collaborative research, services, programs, and pol-

<p>Older Adults

</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Behavioral health care for a rapidly aging population is and will continue to be a 
</p>
<p>national and global public health priority because mental health problems are the 
</p>
<p>single greatest cause of health disability (Steel et&nbsp;al., 2014; Whiteford et&nbsp;al., 2013). 
</p>
<p>The swift growth and increasing biopsychosocial heterogeneity of the older 
</p>
<p>population in the United States (USA) and the rest of the world have been a 
</p>
<p>bittersweet success. More people are living longer and in better health than ever 
</p>
<p>before in most countries. However, advancing age carries an increasing risk for 
</p>
<p>multiple physical and behavioral health problems, chronic conditions, functional 
</p>
<p>impairments and excess disability, frailty, and a changed quality of life. All of these 
</p>
<p>adverse circumstances not only affect the psychosocial and economic health and 
</p>
<p>well-being of individuals with behavioral health problems but also their families 
</p>
<p>and the communities in which they live.
</p>
<p>Geriatric behavioral health policy cannot be understood in isolation from health, 
</p>
<p>social, economic, and welfare policies (Cohen &amp; Eisdorfer, 2011). Aging is a 
</p>
<p>developmental process mediated by biopsychosocial-environmental factors that 
</p>
<p>interact to influence health or disease, functional effectiveness or disability, and 
</p>
<p>resilience or vulnerability. The emergence of illness, including mental illness, in 
</p>
<p>later life usually reflects the consequences of genetics, accumulated trauma, 
</p>
<p>exposure to toxins, health and lifestyle behaviors, environmental factors, and a 
</p>
<p>variety of stressors. Physical health and behavioral health are intimately interrelated

</p>
<p>with one another (Weiss, Haber, Horowitz, Stuart, &amp; Wolfe, 2009), and it is estimated 
</p>
<p>that currently at least 50% of all diseases are affected by behavioral factors, e.g., 
</p>
<p>poor nutrition and exercise patterns, substance abuse, lack of adherence to prescribed 
</p>
<p>medications, and sexual activities (Institute of Medicine, 2001; Johnson, Hayes, 
</p>
<p>Brown, Hoo, &amp; Ethier, 2014).
</p>
<p>Aging is also a sociopolitical experience that affects every person, family, and 
</p>
<p>community as well as every component of a society&rsquo;s infrastructure. Thus, a healthy 
</p>
<p>society must develop policies that create and sustain behavioral and physical health, 
</p>
<p>vitality, economic security, and meaningful productivity for people of all ages.
</p>
<p>This chapter has four objectives:
</p>
<p> 1. To review demographic changes in the unprecedented growth of an aging 
</p>
<p>society.
</p>
<p> 2. To identify the prevalence and impact of geriatric behavioral health challenges.
</p>
<p> 3. To examine the history of public policies that have shaped geriatric behavioral 
</p>
<p>health policies in the USA.
</p>
<p> 4. To examine geriatric behavioral health policies within the broader context of 
</p>
<p>public policies.
</p>
<p> The Demographic Landscape of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Aging Society
</p>
<p>Persons aged 65&nbsp;years and older in the USA will almost double from 48 million 
</p>
<p>(14.1% of the population) in 2015 to 88 million in 2050 (Ortman &amp; Velkoff, 2014; 
</p>
<p>Population Reference Bureau, 2016). The world population aged 65 and older will 
</p>
<p>more than double to 1.6 billion (22% of the world&rsquo;s population) from 2015 to 2050 
</p>
<p>(He, Goodkind, &amp; Kowal, 2016). The oldest-old, persons aged 85 and older, who 
</p>
<p>are at the highest risk for certain disorders and conditions, will continue to grow 
</p>
<p>more rapidly than any other age group, from 2% in 2000 (four million persons) to 
</p>
<p>5% in 2050 (19 million persons) (United Nations Department of Economic and 
</p>
<p>Social Affairs Population Division, 2015).
</p>
<p>Demographic heterogeneity as well as the rapid expansion of an aging popula-
</p>
<p>tion has important implications for developing responsive policies and practices. In 
</p>
<p>spite of greater prosperity, health, vitality, and well-being, there are significant gen-
</p>
<p>der, racial, ethnic, and economic disparities that merit attention to the needs of a 
</p>
<p>culturally diverse older population as well as their family caregivers (Ortman &amp; 
</p>
<p>Velkoff, 2014). Women account for 58% of the population aged 65 and older and 
</p>
<p>75% of the population aged 85 and older. This gender inequality is relevant for 
</p>
<p>several reasons. Older women experience and express illnesses differently than 
</p>
<p>men. In addition, they are more vulnerable due to marital status, living arrangements,

</p>
<p>2014).
</p>
<p>Of the 35 million persons aged 65 and older living in the USA, 16% (5.6 million) 
</p>
<p>are members of ethnic and racial minority groups, and 11% (1.2 million) are foreign- 
</p>
<p>born (Ortman &amp; Velkoff, 2014). In 2000, non-Hispanic whites made up 84% of the 
</p>
<p>population aged 65 and older: 8% were non-Hispanic Black, 6% were Hispanic, 2% 
</p>
<p>were Asian and Pacific Islander, and less than 1% were American Indians and 
</p>
<p>Alaskan Natives. However, by 2050, the non-Hispanic white older population will 
</p>
<p>decline from 84% to 64%, with the Hispanic population increasing to 16%, the 
</p>
<p>Black population increasing to 12%, and Asian and Pacific Islanders as well as 
</p>
<p>American Indians and Alaskan Natives growing to 8% of the older population. The 
</p>
<p>fastest growth will occur in the older Hispanic population, from two million in 2000 
</p>
<p>to more than 13 million in 2050, and they will outnumber the older Black population 
</p>
<p>by 2028 (Ortman &amp; Velkoff, 2014). Thus, the increasing racial and ethnic diversity 
</p>
<p>in the USA will require greater knowledge about differences in health and illness 
</p>
<p>behaviors, help-seeking, patterns of family caregiving, as well as the need for 
</p>
<p>greater flexibility in the organization and delivery of mental health services.
</p>
<p> Behavioral Health Care Challenges of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Aging Society
</p>
<p>There are many indications that behavioral health problems affect a significant pro-
</p>
<p>portion of older adults in the USA.&nbsp;A total of 5.2 million older Americans have 
</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and related dementias, and that number is estimated to triple to 
</p>
<p>14&ndash;16 million by 2050 (Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association, 2016). Between 5.6 and 8 million 
</p>
<p>older people (14&ndash;20%) have a diagnosable behavioral health condition, including 
</p>
<p>mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorders, and other disorders 
</p>
<p>(e.g., personality disorders, sleep disorders). That number is expected to double by 
</p>
<p>2030 (Eden, Maslow, Le, &amp; Blazer, 2012). Within this population, it is estimated 
</p>
<p>that 3&ndash;8% of individuals have a serious mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar 
</p>
<p>disorder, or chronic depression). In addition to the prevalence of both alcohol and 
</p>
<p>medication misuse, about 15% of community-residing older persons have symptoms 
</p>
<p>of depression (Blazer, 2003), and every 68&nbsp;min, an older person kills themselves 
</p>
<p>(Drapeau &amp; McIntosh, 2015).
</p>
<p>In spite of the high prevalence of behavioral health conditions in the older popu-
</p>
<p>lation now and as projected in the future, there is a serious shortage of trained geri-
</p>
<p>atric behavioral health manpower, appropriate clinical services, and tailored 
</p>
<p>psychosocial interventions that coordinate with medical and social service providers 
</p>
<p>(Bartels, Pepin, &amp; Gill, 2014; Cohen &amp; Eisdorfer, 2011). In spite of an urgent need 
</p>
<p>for professionals with expertise in geriatric mental health care, there are currently 
</p>
<p>only 1800 geriatric psychiatrists in the USA, and that number will decrease in the 
</p>
<p>foreseeable future, amounting to only 1 geriatric psychiatrist for every 6000 older 
</p>
<p>adults with a behavioral disorder (Bartels &amp; Naslund, 2013). Unfortunately, the 
</p>
<p>Older Adults</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>234
</p>
<p>pattern of a severe shortfall in providers is the same for other clinicians in geriatric 
</p>
<p>psychology, nursing, social work, and counseling.
</p>
<p>The unmet needs for mental health care are a serious problem, with a substantial 
</p>
<p>proportion of the affected population at risk for ongoing poor physical and mental 
</p>
<p>health outcomes and unnecessary disability (Bartels et&nbsp; al., 2014). Two-thirds of 
</p>
<p>older persons with a mental disorder do not receive needed services, and although 
</p>
<p>they are more willing to pursue mental health care than in the past, the outcome is 
</p>
<p>distressing (Bartels et&nbsp;al., 2014). Only 48% of older persons who received psychiatric 
</p>
<p>help were considered to have received minimally adequate care, and of the large 
</p>
<p>majority who received mental health care in the general medical sector, only 13% 
</p>
<p>received adequate care (Bartels et&nbsp; al., 2014). Since the majority of Americans, 
</p>
<p>especially older Americans, use primary care physicians as their de facto mental 
</p>
<p>health-care providers, these data reflect the inadequacy of current practice patterns.
</p>
<p>Many characteristics of clinical providers and health-care system operations 
</p>
<p>contribute to the poor quality of care throughout the continuum of acute and long- 
</p>
<p>term care. Provider factors include the following: ageism and therapeutic nihilism; 
</p>
<p>lack of knowledge about psychosocial needs, functional effectiveness, diagnostic 
</p>
<p>protocols, and effective treatments; and low referral rates from primary care 
</p>
<p>physicians to mental health specialists. A number of barriers are created by the 
</p>
<p>organization and financing of health-care services. These include the lack of 
</p>
<p>available and accessible mental health services, the lack of integration of mental 
</p>
<p>health care with other medical services, limited reimbursement in long-term care 
</p>
<p>settings, limited coverage for specific treatment, and perceptions by many third- 
</p>
<p>party payers that care of mental health problems is open-ended, leading to high 
</p>
<p>costs.
</p>
<p>The lack of adequate treatment for the range of behavioral disorders has a 
</p>
<p>significant adverse impact on older adults, their family caregivers, and the greater 
</p>
<p>society. Older persons are at risk for decreased functional effectiveness and 
</p>
<p>increased disability, continuing poor physical and behavioral health, a decreased 
</p>
<p>quality of life, and increased mortality. Family members living with the increas-
</p>
<p>ing burden of caregiving demands have higher rates of depression and poorer 
</p>
<p>health status. These factors all contribute to dramatic increased health-care costs. 
</p>
<p>Mental health conditions are among the most costly of eight health conditions in 
</p>
<p>older adults (IOM, 2008), and for those who are beneficiaries of both Medicare 
</p>
<p>and Medicaid, mental health conditions increase costs two to three times (Bartels 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2003).
</p>
<p>A review of historical and contemporary public health policies can provide a 
</p>
<p>perspective about why the behavioral health needs of older adults are underserved. 
</p>
<p>The present system of geriatric behavioral health care is not working, and it will not 
</p>
<p>even begin to meet the future needs of a rapidly growing population of older people 
</p>
<p>(Jeste et&nbsp;al., 1999; National Association of Mental Health Planning and Advisory 
</p>
<p>Councils, 2007). The sad irony is these system failures are occurring in the USA, 
</p>
<p>which has the highest per capita health-care expenditures in the world for older 
</p>
<p>people as well as the largest research investments in developing geriatric behavioral 
</p>
<p>health interventions (Bartels et&nbsp;al., 2014).

</p>
<p> Historical Review of&nbsp;US Public Policy on&nbsp;Geriatric Behavioral 
</p>
<p>Health Research, Policy, and&nbsp;Practice
</p>
<p>The social and economic needs of an aging population emerged as a federal public 
</p>
<p>policy agenda in the 1930s, followed by a public policy agenda for health care in the 
</p>
<p>1960s. The 1930 Census reported there were 6,634,000 people aged 65&nbsp;years and 
</p>
<p>older (5.49% of the total population) (US Census Bureau, 1931). A series of actions 
</p>
<p>by the executive and legislative branches of government led to the passage of the 
</p>
<p>Social Security Act in 1935 during President Roosevelt&rsquo;s administration to help 
</p>
<p>sustain the economic and social welfare of families with older relatives. Recognition 
</p>
<p>of the impact of a growing aging population led President Truman to charge the 
</p>
<p>Federal Security Administration to hold a national conference on aging to evaluate 
</p>
<p>the shifting age demographics. Several other national conferences after that laid the 
</p>
<p>groundwork for the first designated White House Conference on Aging (WHCoA) 
</p>
<p>held in 1961. Six WHCoAs, spanning 65&nbsp;years, led to a number of key national 
</p>
<p>policies and programs that have had an impact on geriatric behavioral health care.
</p>
<p>Health care was the major focus of the 1961 WHCoA, which led to legislation 
</p>
<p>establishing Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 under President Johnson (Tibbitts, 
</p>
<p>1960). However, long-term care largely was overlooked, and reimbursement for 
</p>
<p>mental health care, other than inpatient psychiatric care and psychological testing, 
</p>
<p>was limited relative to physical medical care services. The Older Americans Act, 
</p>
<p>also was passed in 1965, creating the Federal Administration on Aging, an advisory 
</p>
<p>body to the US Secretary of Health and Human Services.
</p>
<p>The spotlight of the 1971 WHCoA, held during President Nixon&rsquo;s administra-
</p>
<p>tion, was on economic security, but several recommendations targeted the need to 
</p>
<p>fund research and training initiatives (WHCoA, 1971). Significant outcomes of the 
</p>
<p>Conference included the establishment of the National Institute on Aging in 1974 
</p>
<p>and the creation of the Center for the Study of Mental Health and Aging within the 
</p>
<p>National Institute of Mental Health. Other major developments included a national 
</p>
<p>nutrition program for older adults as well as the creation of the Federal Council on 
</p>
<p>Aging and the Senate Special Committee on Aging (WHCoA, 1971).
</p>
<p>The 1981 WHCoA was planned under President Carter&rsquo;s administration and 
</p>
<p>implemented under President Reagan (Cowell, 1981). Social security and long-term 
</p>
<p>care were signal areas of concentration. Based on the Conference recommendations, 
</p>
<p>the federal Omnibus Reconciliation Act, passed in 1987, mandated that mental 
</p>
<p>health services be provided in long-term care facilities. The 1981 Conference also 
</p>
<p>produced other mental health recommendations that were implemented over the 
</p>
<p>years. The cap on outpatient mental health services under Medicare Part B increased 
</p>
<p>(repealed 8&nbsp;years later under the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989). Modifications 
</p>
<p>to Medicare allowed psychologists and clinical social workers to be reimbursed for 
</p>
<p>specific services. However, parity between somatic health care and mental health 
</p>
<p>care was not achieved at that time. Mental health-care services continued to be 
</p>
<p>reimbursed at 50% in contrast to 80% for other medical care. It would not be until 
</p>
<p>2008 that parity was achieved. The passage of the 2008 Paul Wellstone and Pete 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>236
</p>
<p>Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act mandated insurance 
</p>
<p>parity for companies of fifty or more employees beginning in 2010.
</p>
<p>During the 1980s, there was increased interest at the federal level. New legisla-
</p>
<p>tion expanded reimbursement for home health care, occupational therapy, and spe-
</p>
<p>cific therapies in long-term care institutions and increased funds for mental health 
</p>
<p>research and research on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. In addition to an interagency task 
</p>
<p>force on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, additional funding created Clinical Research Centers 
</p>
<p>for Geriatric Mental Health and Geriatric Mental Health Training Awards. The 
</p>
<p>Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recommended new programs for the integration 
</p>
<p>of behavioral and primary health care and more clinical geriatric research and 
</p>
<p>demonstration programs at medical centers for older adult populations.
</p>
<p>The 1995 WHCoA convened under President Clinton focused on supporting and 
</p>
<p>reforming existing social and health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and 
</p>
<p>the Older Americans Act (Blancato, 1994). Although the Conference did not endorse 
</p>
<p>any new initiatives, a commitment was voiced to support the field of geriatric mental 
</p>
<p>health and target future national policy focused on an aging population.
</p>
<p>Four major developments occurred in the 1990s. Funding for research on 
</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease grew. In 1991, representatives of several organizations formed 
</p>
<p>the National Coalition on Mental Health and Aging with a mission to advocate for 
</p>
<p>policy reform (National Coalition on Mental Health and Aging, 2018).
</p>
<p>Another milestone was the 1999 Surgeon General&rsquo;s report on mental health iden-
</p>
<p>tifying the prevalence and impact of disability due to mental illness among older 
</p>
<p>Americans now and in the future (Office of the Surgeon General, 1999). Finally, the 
</p>
<p>1999 Olmstead decision of the US Supreme Court determined that institutionalizing 
</p>
<p>individuals with disabilities as well as mental illnesses, who could live in the com-
</p>
<p>munity with supports, is discrimination that violates the Americans with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>Act (Bartels, Miles, Dums, &amp; Levine, 2003).
</p>
<p>The 2005 WHCoA, convened under President George W.&nbsp;Bush, passed many 
</p>
<p>resolutions, and among the top ten priorities was the need to improve the recognition, 
</p>
<p>detection, and treatment of mental illness, especially depression among older 
</p>
<p>Americans. Mental health issues were also the focus of other resolutions regarding 
</p>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid, geriatric manpower, and long-term care reform (Gloth 
</p>
<p>3rd., 2007).
</p>
<p>The 2015 WHCoA, held in Washington under President Obama&rsquo;s administration, 
</p>
<p>was the first to use social media to transform the activities of the conference into 
</p>
<p>opportunities for national and international participation. The overall theme was 
</p>
<p>healthy aging for people of all ages, and there were four priority concentration 
</p>
<p>areas: (1) healthy aging, (2) retirement security, (3) long-term services and supports, 
</p>
<p>and (4) elder justice (WHCoA, 2015). The Healthy Aging Section included 
</p>
<p>discussions and recommendations to optimize cognitive health and increase research 
</p>
<p>on the dementias as well as the need for programs and resources to support the 
</p>
<p>expansion of research, training, and practices to maximize behavioral health 
</p>
<p>(WHCoA, 2015).

</p>
<p> An Integrated Behavioral Health and&nbsp;Social Policy Framework
</p>
<p>Future behavioral health-care policies need to continue to consider the many bio-
</p>
<p>psychosocial and environmental factors that interact to promote behavioral health 
</p>
<p>and maximize vitality and quality of life. Cohen and Eisdorfer (2011) suggest there 
</p>
<p>are three main assumptions regarding integrated geriatric behavioral health policy 
</p>
<p>reform. First, later life should be a time to feel secure regardless of the level of 
</p>
<p>dependency and need for care. Second, later life should be a time, for those who 
</p>
<p>choose, to remain actively engaged in family and community life. Third, any policy 
</p>
<p>(or lack thereof) that diminishes the independence of older adults damages their 
</p>
<p>health and quality of life by increasing marginalization and eventual deterioration 
</p>
<p>and dependency. Working from these assumptions, they created the SAFE HAVENS 
</p>
<p>framework with ten core themes: (1) Security, (2) Alternatives, (3) Functionality, (4) 
</p>
<p>Engagement, (5) Health, (6) Abilities, (7) Values, (8) Environment, (9) New 
</p>
<p>information, and (10) Simplicity.
</p>
<p> Security
</p>
<p>The many axes of security, financial, physical, emotional, and psychosocial create a 
</p>
<p>foundation for behavioral health in older people, and some of the major policy 
</p>
<p>issues that enhance security include retirement benefits, Social Security, Medicare, 
</p>
<p>and other health-care benefits. Although social policies are economically based and 
</p>
<p>executed, they must be steered by beliefs that older people are valuable and merit a 
</p>
<p>secure future. Since the generativity of older generations has supported their families 
</p>
<p>and communities, they not only deserve respect for these contributions but also 
</p>
<p>opportunities to continue contributing in meaningful ways. This country has a moral 
</p>
<p>responsibility to maintain an investment in the older population because programs 
</p>
<p>that benefit older people also help their families and the greater community.
</p>
<p>Social Security and Medicare, funded by Federal tax revenues from the work-
</p>
<p>force, are not solely entitlement programs for older people. They are designed to 
</p>
<p>help families and younger people in the community. Social Security was conceived 
</p>
<p>to save families from economic hardship because parents and older family members 
</p>
<p>were living longer. Likewise, Medicare was intended to assist families with the 
</p>
<p>costs of acute health care for aging relatives. However, continued federal financing 
</p>
<p>of these programs has been an ongoing challenge given the rapid aging of the popu-
</p>
<p>lation, a decreasing ratio of workers to retirees, and other factors.
</p>
<p>Medicare has been a successful policy providing health insurance for the older 
</p>
<p>population as well as blind and disabled populations. It has eased the burden of 
</p>
<p>health-care payments for millions of middle-aged Americans, who would otherwise 
</p>
<p>be paying for the care of parents and grandparents as well as their children. It 
</p>
<p>improved access to health care and therefore the health and quality of life of older 
</p>
<p>persons. Medicare also allowed family members in the workforce to support their 
</p>
<p>Older Adults</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>238
</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s development and education and also pay for housing, transportation, 
</p>
<p>health care, and other expenses which might have otherwise been consumed by the 
</p>
<p>health-care costs of parents and grandparents. Although Medicare has weaknesses 
</p>
<p>including restrictions in long-term care, rising overall costs, and fraudulent abuse, 
</p>
<p>the basic principle of investing in Medicare remains a sound one.
</p>
<p>Economic insecurity is a growing worry, especially among older women, given 
</p>
<p>the projected future shortfall in Social Security financing and the changing structure 
</p>
<p>and availability of pension plans. The soundness of Social Security is contingent on 
</p>
<p>two major factors: (1) the ratio of workers to retirees and (2) level of taxation. 
</p>
<p>Current projections indicate that over time, there will be a shortfall of available 
</p>
<p>funds for the growing population of retirees who in turn are supported by fewer 
</p>
<p>workers paying into the program. At the same time, private pension programs are 
</p>
<p>disappearing, as major corporations are defaulting or scaling down employee 
</p>
<p>pensions to maintain profits. Thus, older persons, even those who had done 
</p>
<p>everything possible to plan and save for retirement, are facing the risk of financial 
</p>
<p>insecurity.
</p>
<p>There are several options to reform Social Security to protect today&rsquo;s older popu-
</p>
<p>lation as well as those who will age into Social Security in future years. These 
</p>
<p>include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) raising the full retirement age, (2) 
</p>
<p>increasing or eliminating the payroll earnings cap, (3) reducing benefits for high- 
</p>
<p>income earners, (4) increasing the payroll tax rates, and (5) establishing parallel 
</p>
<p>Federal investment programs. Increasing the retirement age by 2 or 3&nbsp;years and/or 
</p>
<p>increasing the level of taxable employee earnings to a higher cap would go a long 
</p>
<p>way to resolve economic disparities. However, there are pros and cons to reform 
</p>
<p>options, and it is essential that Social Security not be politicized. Reform will only 
</p>
<p>occur with public education and involvement advocating a bipartisan review of 
</p>
<p>national pension reform.
</p>
<p> Alternatives
</p>
<p>The rapidly growing population of older adults is characterized by increasing het-
</p>
<p>erogeneity, i.e., they are less alike than any other age group on all biological, psy-
</p>
<p>chological, behavioral, and social variables. Scientific advances coupled with the 
</p>
<p>successes of Medicare have contributed to a healthier, more active population, and 
</p>
<p>successive generations of older people have become more diversified. Therefore, it 
</p>
<p>is inappropriate to create policies based on beliefs that with advancing age, people 
</p>
<p>are all sick and dependent, lose their cognitive abilities, and/or are less capable in 
</p>
<p>work-related tasks and responsibilities.
</p>
<p>Policy reform needs to focus on increasing opportunities for older people to par-
</p>
<p>ticipate in meaningful roles instead of promoting barriers that force individuals to 
</p>
<p>retire and become marginalized. The ability to make meaningful choices and per-
</p>
<p>ceive alternatives in later life enhances mental and physical well-being, and policies 
</p>
<p>must encourage alternatives by removing barriers and/or providing incentives to 
</p>
<p>D. Cohen and A. Krajewski</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>239
</p>
<p>facilitate engagement. Provision of reimbursement for personal assistive devices 
</p>
<p>and maximizing functioning through architectural design should enhance barrier 
</p>
<p>freedom in transportation options, home design, workplace sites, and public envi-
</p>
<p>ronments (e.g., hospitals, libraries, malls, courthouses). The older adult population 
</p>
<p>has the largest amount of discretionary income, which should be attractive to many 
</p>
<p>industries to develop a wide range of products, from clothing to travel, to enhance 
</p>
<p>lifestyle and bolster the economy. There are a wide range of attractive products for 
</p>
<p>the senior lifestyle.
</p>
<p> Functionality
</p>
<p>Functionality is a core concept in geriatric health and behavioral health care, and 
</p>
<p>caring for individuals impaired or disabled by illness, frailty, and injuries is often 
</p>
<p>more challenging than curing or managing a disease. Since many geriatric diseases 
</p>
<p>are chronic, the clinician&rsquo;s role is to optimize functioning by integrating behavioral, 
</p>
<p>social, and pharmacological strategies to maximize performance and minimize the 
</p>
<p>occurrence of acute crises.
</p>
<p>Not only can rehabilitation and assistive devices improve many age- or illness- 
</p>
<p>related impairments, these technologies can address opportunities for lifestyle 
</p>
<p>enhancement. Functionality is the outcome of preventive screening and incorporating 
</p>
<p>health promotion/risk prevention behaviors into personal lifestyles. Education about 
</p>
<p>depression, nutrition, obesity, and other health maintenance strategies as well as 
</p>
<p>establishing new behaviors, such as physical and cognitive exercise, enhance 
</p>
<p>functional capacity.
</p>
<p>Medicare and private insurance policies now cover screening and prevention 
</p>
<p>strategies in health and mental health. Medicare Part B covers, at no cost to 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries, a one-time &ldquo;Welcome to Medicare&rdquo; preventive visit, which includes a 
</p>
<p>review of risk factors for depression, an annual screening for depression in primary 
</p>
<p>care settings, and a yearly &ldquo;Wellness Visit&rdquo; to review changes in mental health. The 
</p>
<p>Affordable Care Act, since 2014, required all non-grandfathered health plans to 
</p>
<p>cover a range of preventative services at no cost, including screenings for depression 
</p>
<p>and alcohol misuse.
</p>
<p> Engagement
</p>
<p>One of the most significant policy challenges is to provide meaningful roles for 
</p>
<p>older adults in contemporary society and find ways to support them. Just as it is 
</p>
<p>possible to use many approaches to reduce barriers to mobility and enhance 
</p>
<p>functional effectiveness, it is necessary to maximize older people&rsquo;s engagement in 
</p>
<p>meaningful pursuits and reduce or eliminate barriers to participation.

</p>
<p>Engagement has many different meanings: to engage in work or an occupation, 
</p>
<p>to engage to with others to accomplish mutual goals, to initiate or carry out activities, 
</p>
<p>to enter into a loyal relationship with someone, to interact with other individuals, 
</p>
<p>and to participate in long-term projects and activities. Thus, engagement is manifest 
</p>
<p>in many ways, including but not limited to supporting older people to work or 
</p>
<p>volunteer, encouraging contributional roles within the family and community, 
</p>
<p>helping older persons remain active in physical and social activities that provide 
</p>
<p>personal pleasure and a sense of meaningful participation, appreciating the value of 
</p>
<p>intimate relationships and friendships in later life, and developing policies that will 
</p>
<p>continue to engage the growing aging population.
</p>
<p>Individuals may also be engaged in a range of personally satisfying creative 
</p>
<p>artistic activities as well as political and social causes. Vital involvement, life 
</p>
<p>satisfaction, and personal achievement are potent interventions to combat loneliness, 
</p>
<p>inactivity, and social isolation. Many older people find meaning in family, parenting, 
</p>
<p>and grandparenting relationships as well as in work and volunteer roles in the 
</p>
<p>community. However, there are more broad-based concerns in the development of 
</p>
<p>policies that encourage engagement. As life expectancy continues to increase, a 
</p>
<p>number of challenging questions emerge: What is the &ldquo;shelf life&rdquo; of an individual? 
</p>
<p>What mechanisms are needed to maximize independence and interdependence as 
</p>
<p>well as successful aging within sociopolitical structures? What is the range of 
</p>
<p>stakeholders responsible for developing and implementing policy changes?
</p>
<p>These questions are not theoretical issues. Among the most powerful predictors 
</p>
<p>of emotional well-being in later life are the availability of a confidante and 
</p>
<p>meaningful social relationships and supports. Not having a relationship(s) that 
</p>
<p>facilitates engagement is anomie or disconnectedness, characterized by isolation 
</p>
<p>and loneliness, especially among the very old. Disconnectedness has a profound 
</p>
<p>negative impact on mental and physical health, security, and quality of life. 
</p>
<p>Durkheim referred to anomie as a cause of suicide (Johnson, 1965), and older 
</p>
<p>persons, especially older white males, have high suicide rates (Ivey-Stephenson, 
</p>
<p>Crosby, Jack, Haileyesus, &amp; Kresnow-Sedacca, 2017).
</p>
<p>Societal responsibility for facilitating the engagement of older adults goes hand 
</p>
<p>in hand with individual responsibility to be active, productive, and engaged. Policies 
</p>
<p>that support mechanisms to provide help and assist others are powerful forces that 
</p>
<p>encourage and sustain productive social interactions and productivity. There are 
</p>
<p>many sources of help, including, but not limited to, family, friends, educational 
</p>
<p>institutions, professionals, community groups, business, and governmental agencies. 
</p>
<p>Those who are old, frail, and vulnerable also require a range of affordable and 
</p>
<p>accessible medical as well as home- and community-based services in addition to 
</p>
<p>family and psychosocial support.

</p>
<p> Health
</p>
<p>Four issues are critical in the development of geriatric health and behavioral health 
</p>
<p>policy: (1) availability, (2) accessibility, (3) affordability, and (4) appropriateness of 
</p>
<p>health care.
</p>
<p>Availability refers to two issues: (1) having enough trained geriatric behavioral 
</p>
<p>health professionals and (2) having a knowledge base for clinical guidelines and 
</p>
<p>tools to diagnose, treat, manage, and prevent diseases. The current and projected 
</p>
<p>numbers of behavioral health professionals are woefully inadequate as discussed 
</p>
<p>earlier, making this the single greatest barrier to suitable care. Thus, policies 
</p>
<p>targeting increased training programs for medical students, residents, clinical 
</p>
<p>graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, as well as practitioners, must be a 
</p>
<p>priority. Although more older people are living longer in good health, the burden of 
</p>
<p>chronic illnesses, including the increasing prevalence of comorbidity and the 
</p>
<p>increased dependency on medications and other expensive procedures, such as 
</p>
<p>imaging and dialysis, is costly. From a policy perspective, identifying ways to 
</p>
<p>increase the speed of translation of research results from bench to bedside is 
</p>
<p>essential. Just as important is the responsibility to monitor the safety of new clinical 
</p>
<p>interventions such as drugs and devices once they have been approved and are on 
</p>
<p>the market. At the moment, there are no clear policies about the ongoing surveillance 
</p>
<p>of medication effects as well as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; products not subject to FDA regulation.
</p>
<p>Accessibility and affordability are closely related issues. Accessibility refers to 
</p>
<p>the ease of obtaining care, and affordability refers to the ability to pay for care. The 
</p>
<p>ability to find quality health care and behavioral health care that is affordable and 
</p>
<p>accessible and also deals with the functional needs of older adults remains a 
</p>
<p>challenge. In order to work toward these objectives, the structure and financing of 
</p>
<p>the health-care delivery system need to be reformed. Relatively independent and 
</p>
<p>uncoordinated generalist and specialist physicians deliver most of the health care in 
</p>
<p>this country, despite the recognition that the availability of non-medical supportive 
</p>
<p>services can decrease the burden of health-care management, reduce acuity, enhance 
</p>
<p>function, and prevent institutionalization. Policies to encourage the coupling of 
</p>
<p>health and supportive services as well as to increase geriatric health-care manpower, 
</p>
<p>woefully insufficient at this time, are critical to improve accessible and affordable 
</p>
<p>care. The critical need to boost the numbers of health-care professionals in geriatrics 
</p>
<p>was among the top ten recommendations of the 2005 White House Conference on 
</p>
<p>Aging (Gloth 3rd., 2007) and a 2008 IOM report (Institute of Medicine Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Future Health Care Workforce for Older Americans, 2008).
</p>
<p>Although behavioral health and physical health are interrelated, the systems of 
</p>
<p>delivering and financing care are very different (Unutzer &amp; Park, 2012). Mental 
</p>
<p>health has a powerful impact on health-care costs, in large measure, because mental 
</p>
<p>illnesses are so prevalent, are frequently undetected, and dramatically affect physical 
</p>
<p>health and functional effectiveness (Mojtabai, 2011; Unutzer &amp; Park, 2012). Studies 
</p>
<p>repeatedly show that the cost of health care is significantly impacted by mental 
</p>
<p>health problems, and depression and anxiety disorders significantly increase the 
</p>
<p>Older Adults</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>242
</p>
<p>cost of a patient&rsquo;s general medical or surgical care (Kleine-Budde et&nbsp; al., 2013; 
</p>
<p>Mihalopoulos &amp; Vos, 2013).
</p>
<p>Since health behaviors mediate an individual&rsquo;s risk many for different illnesses 
</p>
<p>and consequently influence health-care costs, health-care reform must consider 
</p>
<p>reinforcing appropriate health promotion and risk reduction health and behavioral 
</p>
<p>health behaviors. A related policy consideration lies in the personal vs. societal 
</p>
<p>responsibility to pay for health care for those who smoke, fail to control their blood 
</p>
<p>pressure by failure to adhere to medications or diet, refuse to exercise, abuse drugs, 
</p>
<p>or refuse rehabilitation or counseling. Health programs should be available without 
</p>
<p>cost to individuals with these behavioral problems who want help, and incentives 
</p>
<p>such as reduced out-of-pocket payments or better insurance rates should be 
</p>
<p>considered for those who practice healthy lifestyles.
</p>
<p>A central issue in health and behavioral health policy is the best ways to craft a 
</p>
<p>three-way partnership between people, providers, and third-party payers to provide 
</p>
<p>quality care, minimize medical errors, and contain costs. This not only includes a 
</p>
<p>partnership for the provision and payment of acute medical care and long-term care 
</p>
<p>services but also preventative screening and interventions (e.g., cholesterol, blood 
</p>
<p>pressure, malnutrition, obesity, bone density screening) as well as vaccinations for 
</p>
<p>conditions such as pneumonia and influenza. Health maintenance behavior programs 
</p>
<p>not only need to be implemented for patients but also family members who are 
</p>
<p>frequently critical partners in the treatment/management plans.
</p>
<p>A number of other important policy issues need to be addressed:
</p>
<p>&bull; Reimbursement should be provided for health professionals, including physician 
</p>
<p>assistants, nurse practitioners, and psychiatric nurse practitioners, who play a 
</p>
<p>crucial role in health.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic health records (HER) need to be implemented. EHRs focus on the 
</p>
<p>total health of the patient and are designed to share information with all clinicians 
</p>
<p>involved in the patient&rsquo;s care. EHRs track data over time, identify when patients 
</p>
<p>are due for preventive screenings or checkups, monitor how patients are doing on 
</p>
<p>various procedures, and monitor and improve overall quality of care within the 
</p>
<p>practice.
</p>
<p>&bull; More health-care and human services professionals trained in geriatric care are 
</p>
<p>urgent.
</p>
<p>&bull; Family caregiver supports and services should be inclusive of children and ado-
</p>
<p>lescent caregivers as well as adults.
</p>
<p>&bull; Initiatives that provide many health-care and social services in the same location 
</p>
<p>are needed to provide &ldquo;one stop shopping.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; Resident-centered geriatric care and psychosocial interventions are priorities to 
</p>
<p>improve long-term care.

</p>
<p> Ability
</p>
<p>The ability domain refers to the productive capacities and performance of older 
</p>
<p>persons. Since the language used in policy communicates underlying values as well 
</p>
<p>as specific content, the concept of ability needs to be emphasized in policy 
</p>
<p>statements. In the absence of serious, crippling health problems, older adults can be 
</p>
<p>productive, able, and generative members of society. The concept of &ldquo;use it or lose 
</p>
<p>it&rdquo; underscores the premise that older adults have capabilities and skills that can be 
</p>
<p>enhanced by physical and cognitive exercises as well as active participation in social 
</p>
<p>or creative activities.
</p>
<p>Predicting competencies requires that performance be measured according to 
</p>
<p>specific criteria. The standards for evaluating performance on tasks such as driving 
</p>
<p>a car, flying an airplane, sitting as a judge, performing surgery, or performing other 
</p>
<p>workplace roles are very different, but performance benchmarks can be defined, 
</p>
<p>measured, and evaluated. Unfortunately, negative biases and unfounded beliefs 
</p>
<p>about older people often presume age-related declining abilities without testing 
</p>
<p>them. As a consequence, policies emerge that diminish or curtail the ability to 
</p>
<p>perform various roles and responsibilities, such as mandatory retirement ages. 
</p>
<p>Although older adults with cognitive, sensory, and physical impairments may be 
</p>
<p>limited in their ability to perform certain&nbsp;activities, these should be addressed on a 
</p>
<p>case-by-case basis. Individual performance criteria should be used instead of 
</p>
<p>chronological age. Age-based mandatory retirement in the corporate sector, state 
</p>
<p>judges, and other occupations, age of entry cut-offs for law enforcement and other 
</p>
<p>public safety occupations, and the age 60 rule for retirement of commercial airline 
</p>
<p>pilots are prime examples of occupational requirements that presume but do not 
</p>
<p>evaluate job-related abilities.
</p>
<p> Values
</p>
<p>Policies need to acknowledge older people as valuable members of society, not 
</p>
<p>reinforce a devaluation because of age. The essence of the concept of value is that it 
</p>
<p>shifts the model of eldercare from a charitable concept to an investment concept. It 
</p>
<p>is an investment in every individual and society to promote dignity and quality of 
</p>
<p>life in the care of older adults, indeed people of all ages. Educating individuals to 
</p>
<p>adopt moral values about the importance of caring for others leads to new ways of 
</p>
<p>thinking about investing in those who are frail and sick.
</p>
<p>Social and health policies need to be formulated to address issues that create 
</p>
<p>access to meaningful pursuits, improves vitality, enhances quality of life, and 
</p>
<p>ultimately promotes behavioral health. For example, the development of community 
</p>
<p>programs to allow older persons to train and participate in voluntary work as well as 
</p>
<p>paid employment should be a priority. Policies restricting the participation of older 
</p>
<p>adults in the workplace need to be carefully justified.
</p>
<p>Older Adults</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>244
</p>
<p>Values, however, are not synonymous with paid employment. There are many 
</p>
<p>generative roles for older adults to invest time and/or money to help others in the 
</p>
<p>family as well as the greater community. Furthermore, older persons can become 
</p>
<p>models of revitalization and inspiration to others when they pursue personal creative 
</p>
<p>activities, such as art, music, writing, drama, or sports.
</p>
<p> Environment
</p>
<p>Older adults generally prefer to continue to live at home, even when frailty and 
</p>
<p>medical conditions threaten mobility, self-care, and safety. &ldquo;Aging in Place&rdquo; is used 
</p>
<p>to describe a broad policy goal to enable older persons to remain in their homes or 
</p>
<p>a familiar community of their choice as long as possible with services and assistance 
</p>
<p>as needs change (Cutchin, 2003). Although many psychosocial, family, and political 
</p>
<p>factors affect how well older adults can age in place, financial circumstances 
</p>
<p>probably have the greatest impact. Those who rent apartments, houses, or trailers 
</p>
<p>may not have the option to remain at home or in familiar communities when 
</p>
<p>properties are sold, and finding affordable, desirable housing may be difficult. Even 
</p>
<p>individuals who own their homes may face diminishing financial resources to pay 
</p>
<p>the mortgage, taxes, maintenance, insurance, and other housing expenses.
</p>
<p>Aging in place is seen as desirable, but this will not be possible unless states have 
</p>
<p>policies that provide support for needed services. These policies need to address the 
</p>
<p>availability of community referral sources and home- and community-based 
</p>
<p>services, accessible health care, coordination among health and aging networks, 
</p>
<p>public transportation, caregiver support services, and affordable and available 
</p>
<p>housing, including home repair services.
</p>
<p> New Information
</p>
<p>The rapid expansion of information, access to information, and utilization/integra-
</p>
<p>tion of information are a challenge for all age groups, and individuals who are not 
</p>
<p>able to access and deal with information become less well informed and able to 
</p>
<p>function in our rapidly changing society. Policies that support educational and train-
</p>
<p>ing programs, sustain cognitive capacities, and help older adults develop new skills 
</p>
<p>to prevent obsolescence are critical, and to do this, a public-private sector partner-
</p>
<p>ship of many different stakeholders needs to become involved in extending educa-
</p>
<p>tional opportunities to the older population. Abundant research has established the 
</p>
<p>value of lifespan learning for enhancing cognitive skills. Computer literacy is now 
</p>
<p>well within the capacity of many older adults, and access to the information on the 
</p>
<p>Internet has become a valuable instrument for decision-making about virtually all 
</p>
<p>aspects of life, including health care.
</p>
<p>D. Cohen and A. Krajewski</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>245
</p>
<p>Continuing education of health and human service professionals is a serious 
</p>
<p>issue for policy formulation as well. Professional associations concerned with aging 
</p>
<p>and mental health provide training programs about the latest research and clinical 
</p>
<p>practice advances. Evidenced-based practice has become the gold standard for 
</p>
<p>clinical care, including behavioral health and social programs. This approach 
</p>
<p>recognizes the importance of using results confirmed by multiple studies to inform 
</p>
<p>clinicians and patients about empirical standards of care and available choices.
</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, evidence-based practice is becoming more accepted 
</p>
<p>as the basis for developing social and mental health programs. Evidence-based 
</p>
<p>practice standards are evolving for the treatment of older adults, but the research is 
</p>
<p>limited at this time to a few areas, including community outreach mental health 
</p>
<p>services and homecare mental health services.
</p>
<p> Simplicity
</p>
<p>The many governmental and non-governmental programs and services for older 
</p>
<p>people and their family caregivers are a confusing quagmire for consumers. The full 
</p>
<p>range of available social and health programs for the older population should be 
</p>
<p>integrated and seamless. Just as having multiple physicians with poor communication 
</p>
<p>patterns adversely affects health care, so do multiple private and governmental 
</p>
<p>agencies become a barrier to quality care. Many of these agencies and health-care 
</p>
<p>settings have different sets of qualifications for the populations served, records are 
</p>
<p>rarely shared between professionals, and older people themselves may not 
</p>
<p>communicate information to staff across the many settings they access. The 
</p>
<p>unfortunate consequence may be if they are turned away in one setting, they may 
</p>
<p>not be aware of other options for assistance.
</p>
<p>Orchestrating and simplifying the process of caring are the most problematic 
</p>
<p>challenges faced by the clinical community. Behavioral health clinicians frequently 
</p>
<p>need to become involved to help patients negotiate the system. Policy reform should 
</p>
<p>include assurances of funding for multi-agency collaboration and the availability of 
</p>
<p>service managers to help patients and families find the right care.
</p>
<p> New Directions in&nbsp;Behavioral Health Care for&nbsp;Older Adults
</p>
<p>New health-care policy programs are fueling changes in the behavioral health care 
</p>
<p>of all Americans, including older people. The Patient Protection and Affordable 
</p>
<p>Care Act (ACA), signed into law by President Obama in 2010 but with most 
</p>
<p>provisions going into effect in 2014, has resulted in some basic changes in health- 
</p>
<p>care delivery. Most of the ACA does not explicitly address geriatric mental health, 
</p>
<p>but some reforms have major implications for costly patients, including older adults 
</p>
<p>with behavioral health disorders who account for a disproportionate portion of 
</p>
<p>Older Adults</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>246
</p>
<p>health-care costs, e.g., Medicare and dually eligible (Medicare and Medicaid) 
</p>
<p>patients (Bartels, Gill, &amp; Naslund, 2015).
</p>
<p>The ACA expands the provisions of the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction 
</p>
<p>Equity Act, requiring insurers to provide the equivalent level of coverage for mental 
</p>
<p>health and substance abuse treatment as provided for other medical/surgical services. 
</p>
<p>Specific components of the ACA relevant to geriatric mental health include nine 
</p>
<p>major components. These include &ldquo;accountable care organizations (ACOs), patient- 
</p>
<p>centered medical homes (PCMHs), Medicaid-financed specialty health homes, 
</p>
<p>hospital readmission and health care transition initiatives, a Medicare annual 
</p>
<p>wellness visit, quality standards, support for the use of health information technology 
</p>
<p>and telehealth, the Independence at Home and the 1915(i) State Plan Home and 
</p>
<p>Community-Based Services program, as well as the Centers for Medicare Services&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
</p>
<p>Innovation, and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute&rdquo; (Bartels et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2015, p.&nbsp;304).
</p>
<p> Accountable Care Organizations
</p>
<p>ACOs are groups of providers that are accountable for the cost and quality of health 
</p>
<p>care delivered to a patient population based on prescribed performance and payment 
</p>
<p>criteria. A new type of ACO, Totally Accountable Care Organizations, integrates 
</p>
<p>physical health and behavioral health as well as social and public health and long- 
</p>
<p>term care services based on an overall payment structure with financial incentives to 
</p>
<p>reduce costs. These programs provide opportunities to integrate a full range of 
</p>
<p>management and preventative care options to manage high-cost older patients who 
</p>
<p>use more behavioral health services.
</p>
<p> Patient-Centered Medical Homes
</p>
<p>PCMHs deliver a coordinated and comprehensive range of health-care services at 
</p>
<p>lower per capita costs targeting the distinctive needs of individual patients. They are 
</p>
<p>ideally suited to provide accessible and extensive physical and behavioral health 
</p>
<p>care for older persons with multiple chronic health problems, including major 
</p>
<p>depression. This model originated in the 1960s as a program to care for children 
</p>
<p>with complex chronic illnesses.
</p>
<p>D. Cohen and A. Krajewski</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>247
</p>
<p> Medicaid-Financed Specialty Health Home
</p>
<p>This model coordinates comprehensive physical and mental health care at a single 
</p>
<p>site for Medicaid patients with complex and/or multiple chronic conditions. Most 
</p>
<p>Medicaid patients are not older persons. However, 17% of Medicaid beneficiaries 
</p>
<p>are dually eligible under Medicare and Medicare, more than 9% are low-income 
</p>
<p>older adults, and 10% of newly eligible individuals are between the ages of 55 and 
</p>
<p>64&nbsp;years (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2018).
</p>
<p> Hospital Readmission and&nbsp;Health-Care Transitions
</p>
<p>Several ACA programs focus on successfully transitioning patients from hospitals 
</p>
<p>to community settings and decreasing hospital readmission rates. These include a 
</p>
<p>pilot program creating working partnerships between hospitals and post-acute 
</p>
<p>providers, a pilot program utilizing payment bundling to hospitals for the total care 
</p>
<p>of patients, and a community-based care transition initiative that delivers at least 
</p>
<p>one transitional care intervention to Medicare patients. A number of studies have 
</p>
<p>reported the effectiveness of transitional initiatives in improving care and reducing 
</p>
<p>readmissions to hospitals in adults, and a few have examined the effect on frail older 
</p>
<p>adults. However, there is scant research on the impact of transitional care for older 
</p>
<p>adults with behavioral health conditions, who usually have other chronic health 
</p>
<p>problems and are at high risk for nursing home admission.
</p>
<p> The Annual Medicare Wellness Visit
</p>
<p>The ACA pays for time-intensive annual wellness visits, at no cost to Medicare 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries (Bartels et&nbsp;al., 2015). The wellness visits include a health professional&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>review of a patient&rsquo;s history, a patient&rsquo;s questionnaire about health risks, physical 
</p>
<p>and functional health assessments, individualized health advice, and follow-up. 
</p>
<p>Follow-up may include diagnostic tests, referrals to specialists, and/or setting goals 
</p>
<p>for health promotion and risk prevention behaviors.
</p>
<p>The visit only includes screens for two behavioral health areas: a depression 
</p>
<p>screen using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a cognitive assessment 
</p>
<p>based on family member reports using an evidence-based, cognitive-screening 
</p>
<p>instrument. However, other aspects of the visits that may be relevant for behavioral 
</p>
<p>health include screening for tobacco dependence and obesity as well as counseling 
</p>
<p>for managing weight and smoking cessation.
</p>
<p>Older Adults</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>248
</p>
<p> Quality Standards and&nbsp;Incentives
</p>
<p>Health plans must submit annual reports reporting specific measures of health-care 
</p>
<p>delivery, including health outcomes and quality indicators. The intent of these 
</p>
<p>reports is to decrease/avoid unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital 
</p>
<p>readmissions. Quality measures include the care experiences of patients and 
</p>
<p>caregivers, care coordination, patient safety, health promotion/disease prevention, 
</p>
<p>and management of complicated high-cost conditions. Some health plans provide 
</p>
<p>incentives to encourage patient participation in health promotion activities, such as 
</p>
<p>physical fitness or smoking cessation programs.
</p>
<p>The ACA includes two quality benchmarks for behavioral health: (1) the scores 
</p>
<p>on the screens for depression and cognitive impairment included in the Medicare 
</p>
<p>annual wellness visit and (2) quality measures of integrated mental health-care 
</p>
<p>programming provided in patient-centered medical homes (Bartels et&nbsp;al., 2015). It 
</p>
<p>also specifies more structured requirements for psychiatric hospitals to follow and 
</p>
<p>report outcomes, which if not submitted results in a payment penalty. Finally, a pilot 
</p>
<p>Medicare program is testing the effectiveness of providing positive incentives for 
</p>
<p>hospitals that achieve specific performance standards.
</p>
<p> Information Health Technology and&nbsp;Telehealth
</p>
<p>One of the expectations for the ACA is that a number of health-care providers will 
</p>
<p>adopt mobile, online, and remote health-care information technologies for diagnosis 
</p>
<p>and treatment, symptom monitoring, and health-care administration.
</p>
<p> Independence at Home Demonstration
</p>
<p>The Independence At Home (IAH) demonstration project from the Center for 
</p>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid Innovation tests the delivery of primary care services at 
</p>
<p>home for individuals with complex, chronic clinical care conditions (Moon, Hollin, 
</p>

<p> 1915(i) State Plan Home and&nbsp;Community-Based Services 
</p>
<p>Program
</p>
<p>This program delivers health care to Medicare beneficiaries with chronic health 
</p>
<p>conditions using home-based primary care teams and provides both acute and long- 
</p>
<p>term medical services on a needs basis (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 
</p>
<p>2014). Under Section 1915(i), states may provide a range of services to special 
</p>
<p>populations, such as older persons with behavioral health conditions. These services 
</p>
<p>include clinic care, case management, psychosocial rehabilitation, behavioral sup-
</p>
<p>port, and health monitoring and promotion (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid 
</p>
<p>Services, 2014).
</p>
<p> Center for&nbsp;Medicare and&nbsp;Medicaid Services (CMS) Coordination 
</p>
<p>Office, Center for&nbsp;Medicare and&nbsp;Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), 
</p>
<p>and&nbsp;Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)
</p>
<p>The CMS Coordination Office coordinates Medicare and Medicaid benefits between 
</p>
<p>the federal government and states for dually eligible individuals, many of whom are 
</p>
<p>older adults with mental health problems. CMMI tests service delivery and payment 
</p>
<p>models to ensure quality of care and minimize expenditures. PCORI develops better 
</p>
<p>standards of evidence for quality of care to improve decision-making for health-care 
</p>
<p>professionals and patients. Both the CMMI and PCORI solicit and fund a number 
</p>
<p>of projects that focus on integrating physical and behavioral health care for 
</p>
<p>vulnerable populations that include older adults with behavioral health conditions.
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Dedicated and concerted advocacy by public and private stakeholders will be essen-
</p>
<p>tial to pave the way to provide optimal care for the population of older adults with 
</p>
<p>behavioral health challenges who will double by 2030, unfortunately at the same 
</p>
<p>time as the number of trained geriatric behavioral health professionals decreases 
</p>
<p>(Eden et&nbsp;al., 2012). The IOM report underscored the necessity to train and support 
</p>
<p>a sufficient cadre of practitioners to provide integrated diagnosis and treatment of 
</p>
<p>geriatric mental health conditions across the broad spectrum of primary care, acute 
</p>
<p>and long-term care, social services, and home- and community-based care settings 
</p>
<p>(Eden et&nbsp;al., 2012). Sadly, no government agencies have been charged with the spe-
</p>
<p>cific responsibility to focus on the mental health-care needs older adults, and despite 
</p>
<p>the IOM&rsquo;s charge that SAMHSA prioritize geriatric mental health, SAMHSA&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>2015&ndash;2018 strategic plan did not identify older adults as a priority and did not

<p>Older Adults</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>250
</p>
<p>specify programmatic initiatives for geriatric mental health services (SAMHSA, 
</p>
<p>2014, 2017).
</p>
<p>The ACA does not specifically focus on the needs of number of older adults with 
</p>
<p>behavioral health needs, but a number of the provisions discussed provide 
</p>
<p>opportunities for improving care. However, the battle will be an uphill one to meet 
</p>
<p>the needs of this high-risk population who go unrecognized.

<p> Overview of&nbsp;Intellectual and&nbsp;Developmental Disabilities
</p>
<p>Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) do not possess any protective factor 
</p>
<p>against the onset of behavioral disorders. In fact, research has shown that persons with 
</p>
<p>intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and related developmental disabilities 
</p>
<p>are more susceptible to certain behavioral disorders than persons in the general popula-
</p>
<p>tion. Due to an individual&rsquo;s intellectual disability and/or developmental disability, the 
</p>
<p>correct identification and treatment do not always follow a standard and expected 
</p>
<p>course. We also know that the presence of behavioral health issues increases the chal-
</p>
<p>lenges of properly supporting these individuals to live successful lives at home, school, 
</p>
<p>and work and in the community. In this chapter we will focus on intellectual and devel-
</p>
<p>opmental disabilities as well as touch upon autism spectrum disorder.
</p>
<p>The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD; 
</p>
<p>Schalock et&nbsp; al., 2010), an interdisciplinary professional society founded almost 
</p>
<p>140&nbsp;years ago, and the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 2013) define intel-
</p>
<p>lectual disability as originating during the developmental period and being character-
</p>
<p>ized by significant impairments in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior.

</p>
<p>Significant impairments are defined as functioning that is approximately two standard 
</p>
<p>deviations or more below the population mean, and limitations in adaptive behavior 
</p>
<p>include skill deficits in the performance of conceptual, social, and/or practical skills.
</p>
<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (APA, 
</p>
<p>2013) defines autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as being characterized by 
</p>
<p>impairments in two realms: (1) social use of communication (including interpersonal 
</p>
<p>skills and reciprocity, back-and-forth communication, understanding non-verbal 
</p>
<p>social cues, eye contact, use and recognition of body language, understanding 
</p>
<p>gestures, recognizing different emotions embedded in facial expressions, etc.) and 
</p>
<p>(2) restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior and interests or 
</p>
<p>activities, including stereotyped motor behaviors, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases, 
</p>
<p>insistence on sameness, and hypo- or hyper-reactivity to sensory input or other 
</p>
<p>sensory aspects. The presence of social communication deficits and restricted, 
</p>
<p>repetitive behaviors and interests manifest during the developmental period and 
</p>
<p>result in significant impairments across multiple life areas.
</p>
<p>Developmental disabilities also are an administrative category of individuals 
</p>
<p>defined under the federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights 
</p>
<p>Act of 2000 (DD Act; Public Law 106-402) and can include a variety of known 
</p>
<p>conditions. Section 102(8) of the DD Act defines developmental disability as a 
</p>
<p>severe, chronic disability that:
</p>
<p> 1. &ldquo;Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and 
</p>
<p>physical impairments&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 2. &ldquo;Is manifested before the individual attains age 22&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 3. &ldquo;Is likely to continue indefinitely&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 4. &ldquo;Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas 
</p>
<p>of major life activity: self-care, receptive and expressive language, learning, mobil-
</p>
<p>ity, self-direction, capacity for independent living, and economic self-sufficiency&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 5. &ldquo;Reflects the individual&rsquo;s need for a combination and sequence of special, inter-
</p>
<p>disciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assis-
</p>
<p>tance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and 
</p>
<p>coordinated&rdquo; (DD Act; Pub. L. 106-402, &sect;102.8, pp.&nbsp;1683&ndash;1684).
</p>
<p>In addition, the Act also addresses infants and children to age 9 who have substan-
</p>
<p>tial developmental delays or specific congenital or acquired conditions. These chil-
</p>
<p>dren may be considered to have a developmental disability without meeting three or 
</p>
<p>more of the criteria described above in 1 through 5 if the individual, without services 
</p>
<p>and supports, has a high probability of meeting those criteria later in life (DD Act; 
</p>
<p>Pub. L. 106&ndash;402, &sect;102.8, p.&nbsp;1684).
</p>
<p> Epidemiology
</p>
<p>Some broader definitions of developmental disabilities are inclusive of conditions 
</p>
<p>such as hearing loss, vision impairment, learning disability, and attention deficit/
</p>
<p>hyperactivity disorder, and, with such definitions, the prevalence rates are as high as 
</p>
<p>M. J. Tass&eacute; et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>255
</p>
<p>14% of the total population of children between the ages of 3 and 17&nbsp;years (Boyle 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2011). For the purposes of this chapter, however, we will use the definition of 
</p>
<p>developmental disability found in the DD Act of 2000.
</p>
<p>According to Larson et&nbsp;al. (2001), developmental disability and intellectual dis-
</p>
<p>ability are not perfectly overlapping conditions. In their study on the prevalence of 
</p>
<p>DD and ID, 48% of individuals had a developmental disability but no co-occurring 
</p>
<p>intellectual disability, 28% had a developmental disability and an intellectual 
</p>
<p>disability, and the remaining 24% had an intellectual disability but no developmental 
</p>
<p>disability (Larson et&nbsp;al., 2001).
</p>
<p>The estimated prevalence of intellectual disability is theoretically between 2 and 
</p>
<p>3% of the general population. This estimate is based on our knowledge of the normal 
</p>
<p>distribution of abilities in the general population and the expected proportion of indi-
</p>
<p>viduals who would be approximately two standard deviations below the population 
</p>
<p>mean (Tass&eacute; &amp; Grover, 2013). However, because the condition is diagnosed when the 
</p>
<p>individual&rsquo;s functioning in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior are 
</p>
<p>significantly subaverage, the actual estimated prevalence falls to approximately 1% 
</p>
<p>of the total population (APA, 2013). Since intellectual disability is a condition that is 
</p>
<p>diagnosed based entirely on the individual&rsquo;s intellectual and adaptive functioning, its 
</p>
<p>etiology can be almost anything and is often multifactorial, including prenatal, peri-
</p>
<p>natal, and postnatal risk factors (see Table&nbsp;1). It is estimated that 30&ndash;40% of all cases 
</p>
<p>of intellectual disability have no known cause(s).
</p>
<p>The prevalence of ASD has been on the rise for the past two decades, increasing 
</p>
<p>almost 300% between 1996 and 2010 (Van Naarden Braun et&nbsp;al., 2015). Boys have 
</p>
<p>consistently been at greater risk of having ASD than girls (i.e., 4:1). The Centers for 
</p>
<p>Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes regular estimates of the prevalence 
</p>
<p>of ASD at approximately 2-year intervals. In 2014, the CDC reported the prevalence 
</p>
<p>of ASD to be approximately 1&nbsp;in 68, up from its previous 2012 published report of 
</p>
<p>1&nbsp;in 88 (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance 
</p>
<p>Year 2010 Principal Investigators, 2012, 2014).
</p>
<p>There is some debate within the field whether the extent to which these increases 
</p>
<p>in prevalence might be a reflection of better case ascertainment and identification, 
</p>
<p>possibly as a result of an increase in awareness and access to services, or whether 
</p>
<p>these changes in prevalence rate are a result of a true increase in incidence. It should 
</p>
<p>be noted that the most recent prevalence statistics published by the CDC in April 
</p>
<p>2016 indicated, for the first time in many years, no change in the prevalence of ASD, 
</p>
<p>remaining at 1&nbsp; in 68 (Christensen et&nbsp;al., 2016). Hence, autism spectrum disorder 
</p>
<p>remains an important public health concern in the United States, with lifetime costs

</p>
<p>associated to ASD estimated at approximately $3.2 million per person. These costs 
</p>
<p>are driven largely by behavioral therapies in childhood, extensive adult care, as well 
</p>
<p>as large indirect societal costs due to lost productivity (Ganz, 2007).
</p>
<p> Behavioral Health and&nbsp;IDD
</p>
<p>People with IDD are susceptible to presenting all forms of behavioral health prob-
</p>
<p>lems found in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Not only are they susceptible, but they are 
</p>
<p>three to four times more likely than the general population to present with behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health problems (Fletcher, Loschen, Stavrakaki, &amp; First, 2007). Among the 
</p>
<p>more common comorbid behavioral health conditions in people with ID, not unlike 
</p>
<p>in the general population, are conditions such as depression and anxiety disorder 
</p>
<p>(Fletcher et&nbsp;al., 2007). Whereas individuals with ASD may also present with high 
</p>
<p>frequencies of comorbidity of anxiety disorder and depressive disorders, children 
</p>
<p>also may present frequently with oppositional defiant/conduct disorder and atten-
</p>
<p>tion deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Simonoff et&nbsp;al., 2008).
</p>
<p>Some evidence has supported the need to adapt the symptoms or signs character-
</p>
<p>istic of psychiatric disorders in people with intellectual and developmental disabili-
</p>
<p>ties. This led to the publication of the Diagnostic Manuals&mdash;Intellectual Disability 
</p>
<p>(DM-ID): A Textbook of Diagnosis of Mental Disorders in Persons with Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Disability (Fletcher et&nbsp;al., 2007), which adapted the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-
</p>
<p>IV-TR (APA, 2000) for persons with IDD.&nbsp; An adaptation of the DSM-5 (APA, 
</p>
<p>2013) was published in 2016 (Fletcher, Barnhill, &amp; Cooper, 2016). In most cases, 
</p>
<p>the diagnostic criteria are relatively the same for people with milder forms of ID, but 
</p>
<p>differences in number count and type of signs and symptoms associated with vari-
</p>
<p>ous DSM diagnoses appear with more significant levels of impairment in cognitive 
</p>
<p>functioning and expressive language.
</p>
<p>Problem behavior is also a common concern among clinicians working with 
</p>
<p>individuals with IDD.&nbsp;Siegel et&nbsp;al. (2014) reported the most common reasons for 
</p>
<p>admission to a specialized in-patient unit for children with IDD were problem 
</p>
<p>behaviors, such as aggression, self-injurious behavior, property destruction, and 
</p>
<p>tantrums, which led to placement in this restrictive clinical setting. The presence of 
</p>
<p>problem behavior in individuals with IDD is, in fact, the most often cited reason for 
</p>
<p>exclusion from more inclusive settings or placement into a segregated classroom/
</p>
<p>school, home, in-patient unit, and/or employment (Bruininks, Hill, &amp; Morreau, 
</p>
<p>1988; Lakin &amp; Stancliffe, 2005). Children with ASD are also six times more likely 
</p>
<p>to be hospitalized in a psychiatric unit than children without ASD (Croen, Najjar, 
</p>
<p>Ray, Lotspeich, &amp; Bernal, 2006). Therefore, effective and coordinated intervention 
</p>
<p>strategies are crucial to preventing and eliminating problem behaviors and increasing 
</p>
<p>adaptive skills and overall quality of life in people with IDD.

</p>
<p> Substance Abuse
</p>
<p>There was a time when few individuals with IDD had opportunity to access illicit 
</p>
<p>drugs and alcohol. With the movements of normalization, valorization of social role, 
</p>
<p>and self-determination, as well as the reduction of coercive controls and restriction 
</p>
<p>of individual rights and freedoms of persons with IDD, came the greater likelihood 
</p>
<p>of individuals with IDD making bad choices that led to less desirable outcomes. The 
</p>
<p>increased prevalence of substance abuse is one such example. While the prevalence 
</p>
<p>of illicit drug and alcohol use in people with IDD is relatively low, their risk of 
</p>
<p>having a substance-related problem is comparatively high (Carroll Chapman &amp; Wu, 
</p>
<p>2012). The severity of the problem of substance abuse in people with IDD is 
</p>
<p>exacerbated by the fact that few effective treatments available for people with IDD 
</p>
<p>exist and people with IDD typically avoid or rapidly abandon treatment interventions 
</p>
<p>for substance abuse (Frielink, Schuengel, Kroon, &amp; Embregts, 2015).
</p>
<p>Although individuals with IDD face a variety of barriers to achieve meaningful 
</p>
<p>inclusion in the community, opportunities that support inclusion for individuals 
</p>
<p>with IDD include customized employment strategies, the promotion of self- 
</p>
<p>advocacy and self-determination for individuals with IDD, and strategies for suc-
</p>
<p>cessful support at the end-of-life.
</p>
<p> Customized Employment
</p>
<p>Customized employment (CE) is defined by the Workforce Innovation and 
</p>
<p>Opportunity Act (WIOA, Pub. L.&nbsp;No. 113&ndash;128) as: &ldquo;competitive integrated employ-
</p>
<p>ment, for an individual with a significant disability, that is based on an individual-
</p>
<p>ized determination of the strengths, needs, and interests of the individual with a 
</p>
<p>significant disability, designed to meet the specific abilities of the individual with a 
</p>
<p>significant disability and the business needs of the employer, and carried out through 
</p>
<p>flexible strategies&rdquo; (USC 29 Chapter &ldquo;Pharmacy Services in Behavioral Health&rdquo;, 
</p>
<p>&sect;705(35)(A), pp.&nbsp; 186&ndash;187, italics by authors). CE &ldquo;utilizes an individualized 
</p>
<p>approach to employment planning and job development&mdash;one person at a time&hellip; 
</p>
<p>one employer at a time&rdquo; (Office of Disability Employment Policy, ODEP, (2018), 
</p>
<p>para. 1).
</p>
<p>The CE process facilitates employment possibilities for job seekers with disabili-
</p>
<p>ties who, due to life complexities, have had difficulty obtaining employment through 
</p>
<p>traditional vocational rehabilitation processes. It considers unique aspects of each 
</p>
<p>person such as age, type of disability, functional capacities, disposition, and interac-
</p>
<p>tion style. The CE process also recognizes contextual factors including resources, 
</p>
<p>living arrangements, geographical location, and services and supports that the per-
</p>
<p>son receives (Smith, Dillahunt-Aspillaga, &amp; Kenney, 2017).

</p>
<p> Why Customized Employment?
</p>
<p>CE is a positive process that focuses on &ldquo;real work in the real world&rdquo; and involves:
</p>
<p>&bull; Painting an accurate picture of a job seeker through the discovery process;
</p>
<p>&bull; Utilizing a strength-based approach to identify talents, interests, abilities, and 
</p>
<p>conditions in which the job seeker can be successful;
</p>
<p>&bull; Welcoming and empowering others, especially those closest to the job seeker, as 
</p>
<p>active participants in the process through development of a person-centered 
</p>
<p>team.
</p>
<p>&bull; Developing relationships with potential connectors and mentors in the 
</p>
<p>community.
</p>
<p>Negotiating employment opportunities that meet the needs of both the job seeker 
</p>
<p>and the employer presents a number of challenges. To do so, to create &ldquo;real work in 
</p>
<p>the real world&rdquo;, the CE process consists of the six key elements: (1) the discovery 
</p>
<p>process, (2) the vocational profile, (3) the customized employment planning meet-
</p>
<p>ing, (4) the visual resume, (5) customized job development and negotiation, and (6) 
</p>
<p>accommodations and post-employment support.
</p>
<p> Discovery
</p>
<p>Discovery is a type of naturalistic assessment that uses qualitative methods to gather 
</p>
<p>information useful in building a narrative snapshot of a job seeker to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>identification of ideal working conditions (Callahan &amp; Condon, 2007). Discovery is 
</p>
<p>a vital part of the CE process because it promotes improved employment matching. 
</p>
<p>The discovery process takes place in natural environments, such as the home, neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood, and community. It includes interviews, conversations, observations, and 
</p>
<p>records reviews to get to know the job seeker and his or her interests, talents, and 
</p>
<p>conditions for employment (e.g., environmental tolerances, social interaction skills, 
</p>
<p>etc.).
</p>
<p> Vocational Profile
</p>
<p>The discovery process culminates in the development of a vocational profile that 
</p>
<p>provides a descriptive picture of the job seeker. It is a robust, narrative report that 
</p>
<p>provides a foundation for effectively negotiating personalized potential job oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities with employers (Condon &amp; Callahan, 2008). The profile is a living docu-
</p>
<p>ment that can be amended as new information is uncovered making it a particularly 
</p>
<p>useful tool for students transitioning from school to the community and workforce. 
</p>
<p>Profiles provide &ldquo;an alternative format to traditional evaluation reports that compare 
</p>
<p>persons with complexities to general standards and others&rdquo; (Callahan, Shumpert, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Condon, 2011, p.&nbsp;5).

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p> Customized Employment Planning
</p>
<p>The customized planning meeting includes the job seeker, family, friends, advo-
</p>
<p>cates, service providers, vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselors, and other stake-
</p>
<p>holders chosen by the job seeker. Ideally, it occurs within 2&nbsp;weeks of the completion 
</p>
<p>of the vocational profile. The purpose of the meeting is to develop a CE blueprint 
</p>
<p>that bridges the gap between discovery and job placement. The information con-
</p>
<p>tained in the vocational profile is utilized to develop a specific plan of action for 
</p>
<p>achieving a competitive, integrated employment outcome in a job that matches the 
</p>
<p>individual&rsquo;s interests, talents, requirements, and conditions for employment.
</p>
<p> Visual Resume
</p>
<p>The visual resume is a sales tool to introduce the job seeker to potential employers. 
</p>
<p>It is different from a typical resume in that it utilizes photos or video clips to dem-
</p>
<p>onstrate the job seeker completing tasks/skills essential to the position. This tool is 
</p>
<p>very useful for individuals who may not be able to express their talents and abilities 
</p>
<p>verbally as is traditionally done through the interviewing process. The visual resume 
</p>
<p>may also be utilized to explain the concept of CE to an employer.
</p>
<p> Customized Job Development and&nbsp;Negotiation
</p>
<p>Customized employment includes negotiating employment opportunities with 
</p>
<p>employers through the identification of unmet business needs that may be fulfilled 
</p>
<p>by the talents of a job seeker. Typically, this process does not begin with a response 
</p>
<p>to an advertisement for employees but rather through meeting with employers and 
</p>
<p>touring businesses to identify mutually beneficial matches. Customized job devel-
</p>
<p>opment strategies include (1) job carving, the process of breaking jobs down into 
</p>
<p>their key components and reassigning those pieces in more efficient or understand-
</p>
<p>able way; (2) job sharing where two or more people share a position based on the 
</p>
<p>strengths of each; and/or (3) job creation where a new job description is developed 
</p>
<p>based on unmet needs of the employer (ODEP, 2018).
</p>
<p> Accommodation and&nbsp;Post-Employment Support
</p>
<p>Post-employment supports have been proven to be beneficial for people with dis-
</p>
<p>abilities who may encounter issues that they are not prepared to handle without 
</p>
<p>assistance (Targett, Wehman, McKinley, &amp; Young, 2004). Prior to vocational reha-
</p>
<p>bilitation case closure, assistance should be provided in the development of natural 
</p>
<p>supports and resources for targeting solutions to challenges prior to the loss of 
</p>
<p>employment. In addition, employees and employers should be aware of the services 
</p>
<p>available through the Job Accommodation Network (askjan.org) to aid in the iden-

<p>tification and implementation of accommodations as required by the Americans 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities Act.
</p>
<p> An Example of&nbsp;Customized Employment
</p>
<p>Individual Allen has autism with limited speech. Through the discovery process, Allen is 
identified as having an interest in video games and a talent for organization and data 
entry
</p>
<p>Setting A local video store that sells new and used games has multiple employees who, 
when interviewed, state that they all prefer answering questions and selling games to 
stocking and organizing. While they are helping customers, games that have been 
ordered or bought for resale are typically set aside until there is time to enter the 
inventory into the computer and put it on the shelves. The sales floor quickly 
becomes disorganized due to movement of product by browsers. When a customer 
requests a particular game, the system does not show that it is in stock because it has 
not yet been entered into the computer, or the system does show it is in stock but the 
game cannot be located on the shelf because it is out of place. The employer 
indicates that, typically, employees are hired to perform all aspects of the job 
(selling, stocking, etc.)
</p>
<p>Result A customized approach allows the individual with autism to be hired to enter games 
into the computer, stock, and organize product. This leaves more time for other 
employees to sell and makes it much easier to access games that are in stock. In 
addition to an increase in sales, morale is increased because employees spend more 
time doing work that they enjoy. A win-win!
</p>
<p>With the possibility of finding employment tailored to an individual&rsquo;s ability, 
</p>
<p>persons with IDD become more independent and take on more responsibility for 
</p>
<p>their lives, such as making decisions regarding work, housing, transportation, and 
</p>
<p>health. Becoming more independent means they must learn to advocate for 
</p>
<p>themselves.
</p>
<p> The Self-Advocacy Movement for&nbsp;Individuals with&nbsp;IDD
</p>
<p>The self-advocacy movement for individuals with intellectual and developmental 
</p>
<p>disabilities is, in itself, a civil rights movement. The movement has its own unique 
</p>
<p>values and beliefs that constitute self-advocacy. The related disability rights 
</p>
<p>movement, also known as self-determination, places a strong emphasis on 
</p>
<p>psychological independence and control over one&rsquo;s life (Conyers, 2003). The efforts 
</p>
<p>to establish disability rights also may be seen as a political movement with a unique 
</p>
<p>set of values, which include self-warmth and involvement in the political process 
</p>
<p>(Putnam, 2005).

</p>
<p>In the United States, the self-advocacy movement has a very vibrant history that 
</p>
<p>dates back to the 1980s (Traustad&oacute;ttir, 2006). Self-advocacy organizations were 
</p>
<p>formed to help individuals with disabilities take control over their lives and to help 
</p>
<p>individuals with disabilities have the right to leave institutions to live in the com-
</p>
<p>munity and live in their communities (Traustad&oacute;ttir, 2006).
</p>
<p> Definition of&nbsp;Self-Advocacy
</p>
<p>Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE), a national self-advocacy organiza-
</p>
<p>tion, defines self-advocacy as follows:
</p>
<p>Self-advocacy is about independent groups of people with disabilities working together for 
justice by helping each other take charge of our lives and fight discrimination. It teaches us 
how to make decisions and choices that affect our lives so we can be more independent. It 
also teaches us about our rights, but along with learning about our rights we learn 
responsibilities. The way we learn about advocating for ourselves is by supporting each 
other and helping each other gain confidence in ourselves so we can speak out for what we 
believe.(Hayden &amp; Nelis, 2002, as cited in Caldwell, Aaron, &amp; Rizzolo, 2011, p.&nbsp;1)
</p>
<p>Other alliances, such as the Florida Self-Advocacy Alliance (FSAA), have devel-
</p>
<p>oped similar lists of values. The FSAA focuses on seven values: (1) moving for-
</p>
<p>ward, (2) expressing choices, (3) being independent, (4) knowing when to ask for 
</p>
<p>help, (5) not being afraid to ask for help, (6) believing in oneself, and (7) letting go 
</p>
<p>(Chapman &amp; Jenkins, 2011).
</p>
<p>The self-advocacy movement was based on the foundation of two models defin-
</p>
<p>ing disabilities: (1) the medical and (2) the social models (Pledger, 2003). The medi-
</p>
<p>cal model, also known as the biomedical model of disability, sees individuals with 
</p>
<p>disabilities as having limitations that affect their ability to function and that need to 
</p>
<p>be &ldquo;fixed.&rdquo; Since the medical model views individuals with disabilities as having 
</p>
<p>medical problems, the medical professional is the expert who can &ldquo;fix&rdquo; their prob-
</p>
<p>lems. The social model of disability views disability as a culture that is affected by 
</p>
<p>social oppression (Magasi, 2008) and has been used successfully for political activ-
</p>
<p>ism. The &ldquo;social model&rdquo; does not view disability as a limitation that needs to be 
</p>
<p>treated by a medical professional but rather promotes the concept of disability pride 
</p>
<p>(Magasi, 2008).
</p>
<p>Disability pride is seen as a rejection of the medical model of disability and rec-
</p>
<p>ognizes disability as a vibrant culture (Magasi, 2008) and part of a unique cultural 
</p>
<p>identity. Over 155 people participated in a study of a group of disability rights activ-
</p>
<p>ists from the Americans Disabled for Assistance Programs Today (ADAPT) move-
</p>
<p>ment. Participants reported having a great sense of pride about being an individual 
</p>
<p>with a disability, and they indicated that they would not want to be &ldquo;cured&rdquo; of their 
</p>
<p>disability (Hahn &amp; Beaulaurier, 2001).

</p>
<p> Self-Advocacy as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Federal Priority
</p>
<p>Self-advocacy is a major priority for the Federal government. Guidelines for feder-
</p>
<p>ally funded State Councils on Developmental Disabilities are written into 42 US 
</p>
<p>Code &sect;15,025, and these Councils have a primary responsibility of supporting self-
</p>
<p>advocacy for individuals with DD (Caldwell et&nbsp;al., 2011). The Administration on 
</p>
<p>Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AIDD), an agency within the Federal 
</p>
<p>government, has taken a new interest in supporting self-advocates who have 
</p>
<p>IDD.&nbsp; The AIDD sponsored two self-advocacy summits to (1) examine how the 
</p>
<p>Federal government can support self-advocates throughout the country and (2) to 
</p>
<p>note the issues and challenges that self-advocates face (Caldwell et&nbsp;al., 2011). The 
</p>
<p>report features four areas challenging self-advocates around the country. These four 
</p>
<p>areas are (1) barriers to self-advocacy, such as transportation; (2) public perception 
</p>
<p>of individuals with developmental disabilities, mainly the continued use of such 
</p>
<p>outdated language as mentally retarded; (3) support of self-advocates; and (4) the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a technical assistance center to support the self-advocacy movement 
</p>
<p>(Caldwell et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p>There are a number of national organizations involved in the self-advocacy 
</p>
<p>movement; however, three are of particular note: (1) Self-Advocates Becoming 
</p>
<p>Empowered (SABE), (2) ADAPT, and (3) Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN).
</p>
<p>Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE) is a self-advocacy organization 
</p>
<p>comprised of individuals with developmental disabilities. Founded in 1993, SABE 
</p>
<p>was the initial self-advocacy organization for individuals with developmental 
</p>
<p>disabilities (Ward &amp; Meyer, 1999). The mission of the organization is to &ldquo;ensure 
</p>
<p>that people with disabilities are treated as equals and that they are given the same 
</p>
<p>decisions, choices, rights, responsibilities, and chances to speak up to empower 
</p>
<p>themselves; opportunities to make new friends; and to learn from their mistakes&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(SABE, 2011). A major focus of the organization is advocating for the 
</p>
<p>deinstitutionalization of individuals with developmental disabilities.
</p>
<p>ADAPT, considered the radical component of the self-advocacy movement, 
</p>
<p>seeks to promote change on behalf of individuals with disabilities by utilizing civil 
</p>
<p>disobedience. One of the oldest self-advocacy organizations, ADAPT (then 
</p>
<p>American Disabled for Accessible Public Transit) began its national campaign for 
</p>
<p>lifts on buses and access to public transit for people with disabilities in 1983. It 
</p>
<p>played a major role in gaining passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act 
</p>
<p>(ADA), focusing on requirements relating to accessible transit, and the perception 
</p>
<p>of the ADA as civil rights law. Describing itself as &ldquo;a national grass-roots community 
</p>
<p>that organizes disability rights activists to engage in nonviolent direct action, 
</p>
<p>including civil disobedience, to assure the civil and human rights of people with 
</p>
<p>disabilities to live in freedom&rdquo; (ADAPT, 2018), APAPT advocated for the Disability 
</p>
<p>Integration Act (2017). The Act would require changes to policies of public entities 
</p>
<p>and long-term service and supports insurance providers to increase resources and 
</p>
<p>supports for persons with disabilities to live independently within their communities.

</p>
<p>The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN), a national self-advocacy organi-
</p>
<p>zation for individuals with ASD, advances the principles of the disability rights 
</p>
<p>movement with regard to ASD.&nbsp;ASAN believes that the goal of autism advocacy 
</p>
<p>should be to facilitate a world in which people with ASD enjoy the same access, 
</p>
<p>rights, and opportunities as all other citizens. ASAN works to empower people with 
</p>
<p>ASD across the globe to take control of their lives and the future of their common 
</p>
<p>communities. The Network seeks to organize the community of persons with ASD 
</p>
<p>to ensure their voices are heard in national conversations. Their slogan is &ldquo;Nothing 
</p>
<p>About Us, Without Us!&rdquo; (ASAN: Autistic Self-Advocate Network, 2018).
</p>
<p>With the increased emphases on self-advocacy and longer life-spans for persons 
</p>
<p>with IDD, there is growing concern, from social and public policy perspectives, on 
</p>
<p>how persons with IDD can age successfully with appropriate community and 
</p>
<p>residential supports.
</p>
<p> Aging with&nbsp;an&nbsp;Intellectual and&nbsp;Developmental Disability
</p>
<p>The need to research the diverse processes of aging, whether social, physical, psy-
</p>
<p>chological, or biological, led to the discipline of gerontology (i.e., the study of 
</p>
<p>aging) and geriatrics (i.e., medical care of older adults). In general terms, gerontology 
</p>
<p>generally refers to those who are 65+ years of age. As the population aged 65+ 
</p>
<p>rapidly increases, so will the demand rise for practitioners who serve the aging 
</p>
<p>population. In the United States, we are in the midst of the aging of the baby boomer 
</p>
<p>generation (i.e., people born during 1946&ndash;1964). Every day over 10,000 Baby 
</p>
<p>Boomers reach age 65, increasing the current percentage of the US population of 
</p>
<p>older adults from 13% to 18% by 2030 (Cohn &amp; Taylor, 2010). This demographic 
</p>
<p>change is well known to those in the fields of geropsychology and geropsychiatry 
</p>
<p>who specialize in the study, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders in old age 
</p>
<p>(see Chapter &ldquo;Older Adults&rdquo; in this volume for additional information on older 
</p>
<p>adults and behavioral health).
</p>
<p>The majority of individuals with IDD now have a similar life expectancy (LE) to 
</p>
<p>that of the general population. Historically, the gap had been far greater, but in 
</p>
<p>recent decades, the gap has closed quite dramatically. For example, between 1983 
</p>
<p>and 1997, LE rose an astonishing 24&nbsp;years for people with Down syndrome, eight 
</p>
<p>times the rate of increase for the general population in that same period (Yang, 
</p>
<p>Rasmussen, &amp; Friedman, 2002). Comparatively speaking, people with IDD are a 
</p>
<p>relatively small segment of the aging population, with 641,860 people aged 60&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>in 2000, a figure that is expected to double to 1.2 million by 2030 (Heller, Stafford, 
</p>
<p>Davis, Sedlezky, &amp; Gaylord, 2010).
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a significant proportion of aging individuals with IDD who 
</p>
<p>need lifelong supports or will be accessing support services when their family 
</p>
<p>caregivers can no longer provide such care. Unfortunately few professionals are 
</p>
<p>ready to meet the challenges that arise in providing appropriate supports for aging 
</p>
<p>people with IDD, even though their numbers are rapidly rising (Perkins &amp; Moran, 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health Services for&nbsp;Persons with&nbsp;Intellectual and&nbsp;Developmental Disabilities</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>264
</p>
<p>2010). According to the National Association for the Dually Diagnosed (NADD, 
</p>
<p>2016), 30&ndash;35% of people with IDD have behavioral health problems. Therefore, 1/3 
</p>
<p>of aging people with IDD are likely to have lifelong behavioral health issues (e.g. 
</p>
<p>depression, anxiety) or develop new ones. The remainder of this section will draw 
</p>
<p>attention to three topics that are often overlooked areas of practice that behavioral 
</p>
<p>health practitioners can provide invaluable supports to people aging people with 
</p>
<p>IDD: Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; coping with loss, grief, and death; and preparation for 
</p>
<p>end-of-life.
</p>
<p> Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and&nbsp;IDD
</p>
<p>Justifiably, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is a major public health and behavioral health con-
</p>
<p>cern, prompting the passage of the National Alzheimer&rsquo;s Project Act in 2011 (Pub. 
</p>
<p>L. 111-375). This legislation provides for a coordinated national strategy and essen-
</p>
<p>tial framework to combat what the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association describes as &ldquo;one of 
</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s most feared and costly diseases&rdquo; (Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association, 2016). 
</p>
<p>Currently 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, which is projected to 
</p>
<p>almost triple to 13.8 million persons by 2050, if efforts to prevent or cure the disease 
</p>
<p>are not successful (Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association, 2016).
</p>
<p>The National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices 
</p>
<p>(NTG) was formed to examine and report on the needs of adults with ID and demen-
</p>
<p>tia. After the National Alzheimer&rsquo;s Project Act was passed, the NTG advocated for 
</p>
<p>and tracked progress on the implementation of the national plan with specific empha-
</p>
<p>sis on inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities (Bishop et&nbsp; al., 2015). The 
</p>
<p>NTG, a nationwide collaboration of researchers, clinicians, and long- term care pro-
</p>
<p>viders, has produced a range of practice guidelines, screening tools, education and 
</p>
<p>training curricula (see www.AADMD.org/NTG for further information).
</p>
<p>People with Down syndrome are at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>disease. Onset occurs at a much earlier age, between 40 and 49&nbsp;years, compared with 
</p>
<p>72&nbsp;years in the general population. Duration is 5&ndash;8&nbsp;years compared with 7&ndash;20&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>in the general population (Head, Powell, Gold, &amp; Schmitt, 2012; Head, Silverman, 
</p>
<p>Patterson, &amp; Lott, 2012). Though not all conditions associated with IDD present with 
</p>
<p>any greater risk of developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease than the general population, one 
</p>
<p>unfortunate ramification of increased longevity of all people with IDD is there are 
</p>
<p>many more individuals reaching ages when the prevalence of developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>disease increases. Also, a number of potential risk factors differentially impact peo-
</p>
<p>ple with IDD, including more limited cognitive reserve, greater propensity for sig-
</p>
<p>nificant head injuries, obesity, and poor cardiovascular health (NTG, 2012).
</p>
<p>Though Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease has no known cure, pharmacological and environ-
</p>
<p>mental treatments can slow the disease&rsquo;s progression and improve quality of life. An 
</p>
<p>early diagnosis is crucial to maximize treatment effects. Unfortunately, this can be 
</p>
<p>very difficult because the onset of the disease can be harder to detect in those with 
</p>
<p>pre-existing intellectual disability. Furthermore, commonly used screening instru-

</p>
<p>ments are not normed or appropriate for people with intellectual disability. As such, 
</p>
<p>the NTG-Early Detection Screen for Dementia is highly recommended, as it can 
</p>
<p>help identify people with dementia-like symptoms whose behaviors are from other 
</p>
<p>causes (e.g., medication interactions, depression, thyroid disorders), and the screen 
</p>
<p>can be easily incorporated into an annual wellness check (NTG, 2016). It is crucial 
</p>
<p>to establish a baseline of functioning to discern what may be a new potentially 
</p>
<p>dementia-related symptom or behavior and what is the established idiosyncratic 
</p>
<p>behavior for a particular individual. Compiling a detailed history can be more 
</p>
<p>problematic in people with IDD, especially those who live in residential group 
</p>
<p>homes, due to gaps in caregivers&rsquo; knowledge.
</p>
<p>Diagnostic overshadowing (Reiss &amp; Szyszko, 1983) is a particular challenge, 
</p>
<p>whereby behavioral health professionals attribute signs and symptoms to the 
</p>
<p>intellectual disability and not to the manifestation of a behavioral health condition. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, for some individuals who are non-verbal, new or novel behaviors may be 
</p>
<p>their attempt to communicate the changes and confusion that they are experiencing 
</p>
<p>with their cognitive functioning. Conversely, some can do so very eloquently. &ldquo;My 
</p>
<p>Thinker&rsquo;s Not Working,&rdquo; an aptly named title of a report from NTG (2012), is 
</p>
<p>actually a quote from an individual with IDD who was describing the effects of 
</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.
</p>
<p>Careful probing and observation by professionals and caregivers may assist the 
</p>
<p>communication of symptoms of forgetfulness and the differential impact on spatial, 
</p>
<p>short, and long-term memory. All general protocols for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease 
</p>
<p>management, psychosocial, behavioral, environmental, and pharmaceutical are 
</p>
<p>equally applicable to people with IDD, but for more specific guidance refer to 
</p>
<p>Moran, Rafii, Keller, Singh, and Janicki (2013).
</p>
<p> Coping with&nbsp;Loss, Grief, and&nbsp;Death
</p>
<p>An inevitable part of life is experiencing loss, and with increasing age, one is more 
</p>
<p>likely to do so. It is a part of the human experience, and as such, people with IDD 
</p>
<p>should be fully supported to express their feelings when losses occur. Aside from all 
</p>
<p>the usual situations that can result in a sense of loss (e.g., changes of job, moving 
</p>
<p>home, death of a loved one, the ending of significant intimate relationships and 
</p>
<p>friendships, development of chronic health issues, etc.), it is important to consider 
</p>
<p>other events and changes that may trigger a sense of loss with people with IDD.
</p>
<p>The vast majority of people with IDD will live with their parents and other fam-
</p>
<p>ily caregivers for their entire life. Gains in longevity have resulted in many people 
</p>
<p>with IDD now outliving their parents and potentially siblings, too. The death of 
</p>
<p>family caregivers may also coincide with a move out of the family home into a 
</p>
<p>completely new environment (e.g., to a group home). Such changes can be extremely 
</p>
<p>abrupt and very traumatic.
</p>
<p>Another scenario that arises for those who live in group homes and other residen-
</p>
<p>tial settings is the loss/retirement of a formal support worker with whom the indi-
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health Services for&nbsp;Persons with&nbsp;Intellectual and&nbsp;Developmental Disabilities</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>266
</p>
<p>vidual with IDD was particularly close and does not understand why someone who 
</p>
<p>was a daily presence in their lives is now only seen occasionally, if at all. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>a noted issue is the high turnover of direct support professionals, leading to instabil-
</p>
<p>ity and constant change in the staff that people with IDD may form close attach-
</p>
<p>ments. Professionals should be alert to the variety of potential and perhaps innocuous 
</p>
<p>causes of loss that may trigger a grief reaction and be sensitive to the relative impact 
</p>
<p>it may have upon the individual.
</p>
<p>When people with IDD experience grief, they will have the same range of physi-
</p>
<p>cal, emotional, and behavioral reactions. However, the degree to which the person 
</p>
<p>understands the traumatic loss and the reasons behind the loss, coupled with their 
</p>
<p>ability to express and/or communicate their feelings, can all impact how a loss is 
</p>
<p>processed and grieved. Furthermore, a person may experience a death of a loved one 
</p>
<p>but has never really conceptualized or had the opportunity to learn about the finality 
</p>
<p>of death. Interestingly, Lipe-Goodson and Goebel&rsquo;s work (1983) suggested that the 
</p>
<p>understanding of death is not as dependent on intellectual disability and more so on 
</p>
<p>chronological age, emphasizing the importance of experiential learning. Thus, any 
</p>
<p>type of loss experienced across the lifespan is an opportunity to increase under-
</p>
<p>standing about loss. Such understanding can be further cemented by having discus-
</p>
<p>sions of former friends/relatives who have died, or favorite pets. Inclusion of people 
</p>
<p>with IDD at funeral/memorial services is also very important, in saying goodbye 
</p>
<p>and collectively grieving with others.
</p>
<p>People with IDD may manifest their grief in different ways, including having an 
</p>
<p>unwarranted sense of guilt or displacement of their sense of anger on others, 
</p>
<p>especially in those with limited understanding to why an event has occurred (Doka, 
</p>
<p>2010). Another issue is disenfranchised grief, when an individual experiences a loss 
</p>
<p>but that loss is not mourned, socially supported, or worse still even acknowledged 
</p>
<p>(Doka, 2002). Unfortunately, people with IDD often experience disenfranchised 
</p>
<p>grief from inappropriate and inadequate response from family or professional 
</p>
<p>caregivers who have had little training or guidance on how to support people with 
</p>
<p>IDD in their grief (Lavin, 2002).
</p>
<p>Another issue is that professionals, friends, or family may feel that people with 
</p>
<p>IDD need to be protected and may shield them from open discussion regarding death, 
</p>
<p>disclosure of a particular event, and attendance at funerals (Lavin, 2002). Such over-
</p>
<p>protectiveness actually denies the right of the individual to learn how to cope with the 
</p>
<p>loss and can lead to an increased sense of isolation, confusion, and anxiety. Generally, 
</p>
<p>it should be remembered that constant reassurance and extra time may be needed to 
</p>
<p>establish a therapeutic relationship when a person with IDD receives grief counsel-
</p>
<p>ing. When a death is imminent, or occurs, the individual with IDD should have the 
</p>
<p>same opportunities to be physically present and involved with the dying/dead person 
</p>
<p>as any other would (Doka, 2010). Unfortunately, though many people with IDD may 
</p>
<p>need additional support to cope with the death/significant loss, few may actually 
</p>
<p>receive it, as professionals are generally unaware and uneducated about their unique 
</p>
<p>issues. Fortunately, there is a growing interest to address this shortcoming. The 
</p>
<p>Hospice Foundation of America&rsquo;s (2013) self-study course, &ldquo;Supporting Individuals 
</p>
<p>with IDD through Serious Illness, Grief, and Loss,&rdquo; is one such example.

</p>
<p> Preparation for&nbsp;the&nbsp;End-of-Life
</p>
<p>Thinking about our own mortality and preparing for our death and beyond is some-
</p>
<p>thing we universally acknowledge as something we should do, but increasing age 
</p>
<p>does increase the probability that we would formalize such plans. Even so, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to a survey conducted by the AARP Research Group (2000), in those aged 50+, 
</p>
<p>60% have a will, 23% have a living trust, and 45% have a durable power of attorney, 
</p>
<p>but only 17% have all three! Another study found that in those 18&nbsp;years and older, 
</p>
<p>60% want their end-of-life wishes to be respected, yet only a third of them had 
</p>
<p>completed advance directives (Pollack, Morhaim, &amp; Williams, 2010). Against the 
</p>
<p>apparent reluctance for end-of-life planning for people with no intellectual/cogni-
</p>
<p>tive difficulties, one can imagine the task can seem even more onerous for people 
</p>
<p>with IDD, their family caregivers, and professionals who support them. However, 
</p>
<p>Kingsbury (2010) advocates that advanced care planning for health/end-of-life 
</p>
<p>wishes can and should be incorporated into regular person-centered- planning 
</p>
<p>practices.
</p>
<p>One of the major tenets of person-centered planning is to empower individuals to 
</p>
<p>have control over their own lives and make choices that reflect their own needs. 
</p>
<p>Person-centered planning gives the advantage of having a structured process to 
</p>
<p>identify cultural, spiritual, and family rituals that may not be known and can be 
</p>
<p>updated and modified as circumstances may dictate or with changes in someone&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>expressed wishes (Kingsbury, 2010). Also it is recommended to start these 
</p>
<p>conversations sooner rather than later, although approaching general decision- 
</p>
<p>making issues first, before the more poignant end-of-life planning is advisable 
</p>
<p>(Kingsbury, 2010). For example, begin with general topics such as potential organ 
</p>
<p>donation, versus personal wishes for interment. For further guidance, resources, 
</p>
<p>such as People Planning Ahead: Communicating Healthcare and End-of-Life 
</p>
<p>Wishes (Kingsbury, 2009), provide an invaluable framework for professionals 
</p>
<p>engaged in this area.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, many people with IDD have had all major decisions in their life 
</p>
<p>made by legal guardians, but there is a growing movement that advocates for 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supported Decision-Making,&rdquo; whereby people use trusted family/friends and 
</p>
<p>professionals, so they can make decisions without the need for &ldquo;overly broad and 
</p>
<p>restrictive guardianships&rdquo; (Blanck &amp; Martinis, 2015). The right to make one&rsquo;s own 
</p>
<p>decisions on critical aspects of one&rsquo;s health, choices for treatment, and ultimately 
</p>
<p>death are some of the most fundamental decisions we make. Friedman and Helm 
</p>
<p>(2010) rightly describe end-of-life choices as being one of the most compelling 
</p>
<p>issues that require clarification and insight. Such importance is not diminished in 
</p>
<p>any way whatsoever by having an intellectual disability; quite the reverse, it is even 
</p>
<p>more critical that such decisions, and wishes, are correctly identified, respected, and 
</p>
<p>implemented.

</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Working with persons with IDD can be challenging, due to the burden of disease 
</p>
<p>attributed to co-occurring intellectual/developmental disabilities and mental 
</p>
<p>illnesses (Einfeld, Ellis, &amp; Emerson, 2011). However, in the United States, 
</p>
<p>approximately one-third (32.9%) of the total number of individuals with IDD served 
</p>
<p>by state developmental disability agencies have mental illnesses (MI), one-third 
</p>
<p>(32.9%) have some combination of IDD and MI, and 22.7% needed support to 
</p>
<p>manage self-injurious behavior, 38.8% for disruptive behavior, and 25.1% for 
</p>
<p>destructive behavior (Human Services Research Institute &amp; National Association of 
</p>
<p>State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services, 2013). Clearly, individuals 
</p>
<p>with IDD and co-occurring MI require a flexible array of services to help them 
</p>
<p>effectively reside in their communities. Services and funding models need to be 
</p>
<p>designed to promote the necessary flexibility and services infrastructure persons 
</p>
<p>with IDD and MI need based on the individual.
</p>
<p>Behavioral health professionals must be prepared to competently provide treat-
</p>
<p>ment to individuals with disabilities. According to the self-advocacy movement, the 
</p>
<p>medical model is not an acceptable treatment framework for individuals with dis-
</p>
<p>abilities. Many of those who are involved in the self-advocacy movement believe that 
</p>
<p>having a disability is an extraordinary gift. Behavioral health professionals must be 
</p>
<p>able to recognize this and to help individuals with disabilities become empowered.
</p>
<p>Behavioral health professionals also need to recognize individuals with disabili-
</p>
<p>ties as a unique culture rather than a population that should be pathologized and 
</p>
<p>treated with special care. It is important for professionals to embrace this vibrant 
</p>
<p>culture and become aware of the disability rights movement and how it affects the 
</p>
<p>counseling relationship. Empowerment is a critical responsibility of behavioral health 
</p>
<p>professionals. Behavioral healthcare professionals need to work with individuals 
</p>
<p>with disabilities and be willing to get involved in the self-advocacy movement.
</p>
<p>As we close this chapter, we would like to reiterate the importance of being able 
</p>
<p>to &ldquo;age in place,&rdquo; in&nbsp;local communities, with person-centered services, developing 
</p>
<p>workforce competencies, receiving integrated and effective services provision, and 
</p>
<p>helping to develop and implement proven models of care and treatment for people 
</p>
<p>with IDD and behavioral health disorders.

<p>Integration of&nbsp;Primary Care 
and&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>

</p>
<p> General Overview and&nbsp;Rationale for&nbsp;Integrated Care
</p>
<p>One of the great challenges facing health care over the last 50&nbsp;years has been how 
</p>
<p>to manage chronic medical problems. Medicine, as a system, has traditionally 
</p>
<p>focused on swiftly addressing life-threatening illnesses, and, as a result, chronic, 
</p>
<p>fluctuating, and slowly progressive disorders are often missed or inconsistently 
</p>
<p>managed (Institute of Medicine, 2001). As medical technology has increased lon-
</p>
<p>gevity, so too has it increased the number of people living with chronic medical 
</p>
<p>conditions. This has led to a tipping point in the USA wherein many patients are 
</p>
<p>receiving care for chronic medical conditions, but fewer than half of the patients 
</p>
<p>seen for depression, hypertension, or diabetes are receiving appropriate treatment 
</p>
<p>(Clark et&nbsp;al., 2000; Joint National Committee on Prevention, 1997; Young, Klap, 
</p>
<p>Sherbourne, &amp; Wells, 2001).
</p>
<p>More concerning still is that this has now begun to negatively affect longevity, 
</p>
<p>resulting, in the USA, in decreased life expectancy for the next generation 
</p>
<p>(Olshansky et&nbsp;al., 2005). Specific to mental health, large population studies have 
</p>
<p>found that major depressive disorder alone can decrease life expectancy by more 
</p>
<p>than 10&nbsp;years (Chang et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, researchers have studied the impact of depression in primary 
</p>
<p>care settings, with discouraging findings. It has been found that 5&ndash;12% of primary

</p>
<p>care patients at any point in time will meet criteria for major depressive disorder 
</p>
<p>(Katon &amp; Schulberg, 1992). Furthermore, early studies found depressed patients 
</p>
<p>utilize health care twice as much as non-depressed patients, have greater functional 
</p>
<p>impairment than that expected from their other medical conditions alone, and are 
</p>
<p>more likely to have medically unexplained symptoms (Katon &amp; Sullivan, 1990; 
</p>
<p>Simon, Ormel, VonKorff, &amp; Barlow, 1995; Simon &amp; VonKorff, 1991; Wells et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>1989). Since its initial investigation, depression remains the most common cause of 
</p>
<p>disability worldwide and one of the most encountered diagnoses (Un&uuml;tzer &amp; Park, 
</p>
<p>2012). Only half of patients with major depressive disorder are identified accurately 
</p>
<p>in primary care, (Akincigil &amp; Matthews, 2017; National Academies of Sciences, 
</p>
<p>Engineering, &amp; Medicine, 2015), and of those only half who are referred to spe-
</p>
<p>cialty mental health care will make it to an appointment (Pace et&nbsp;al., 2018). In fol-
</p>
<p>low-up studies, this remains true and worsens in populations of ethnic minorities, 
</p>
<p>older adults, medically complex patients, and men (Ettner et&nbsp;al., 2010; Gonzalez 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2010). When treated in primary care, patients may face client, provider, and 
</p>
<p>health system barriers, including infrequent appointments, delays in medication 
</p>
<p>adjustments, and discontinuation of antidepressants (Grembowski et&nbsp; al., 2002; 
</p>
<p>Katon, Berg, Robins, &amp; Risse, 1986; Ross et&nbsp;al., 2015; Simon, VonKorff, Wagner, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Barlow, 1993).
</p>
<p>In addition to decreased life expectancy, mental disorders also lead to more fre-
</p>
<p>quent and severe chronic health conditions. Patients with psychiatric disorders have 
</p>
<p>a threefold increase in the rate of diabetes, ten times the rate of heart disease, and 40 
</p>
<p>times the rate of cancer (Murray et&nbsp;al., 2012). The relationship between psychiatric 
</p>
<p>and other medical conditions is likely complex. However, half of patients with a 
</p>
<p>psychiatric concern struggle with adherence to medical recommendations (Murray 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>Access to specialized mental health care is limited for primary care patients, and, 
</p>
<p>inversely, access to primary care is limited for persons with severe mental illness. 
</p>
<p>This can result in treatable medical problems affecting health, wellness, and life 
</p>
<p>expectancy in mental health settings.
</p>
<p>To improve outcomes in this population with frequent comorbid psychiatric and 
</p>
<p>other medical needs, improvements are needed in care delivery methods. Systems 
</p>
<p>pressures, including health care workforce shortages and the enactment of value- 
</p>
<p>based care plans, greatly influence how any novel approach can function sustainably 
</p>
<p>(Renders et&nbsp;al., 2001; Wagner et&nbsp;al., 2001). With a formidable workforce shortage 
</p>
<p>in mental health care, 18% of US counties have an unmet need for non- prescribing 
</p>
<p>mental health professionals (e.g., social workers, psychotherapists), while 96% of 
</p>
<p>counties have a shortage of prescribers (e.g., psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practi-
</p>
<p>tioners) (Thomas, Ellis, Konrad, Holzer, &amp; Morrissey, 2009).
</p>
<p>The concept of value-based care has developed to address the US high per capita 
</p>
<p>health care costs that are coupled with lagging health metrics (Porter, 2009). Value- 
</p>
<p>based care emphasizes the creation of tracking measurements to assess and improve 
</p>
<p>outcomes in health care.
</p>
<p>S. Haack et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>275
</p>
<p>In response to these and other pressures, several models of integrated team-based 
</p>
<p>care have developed, all of which aim to achieve improved clinical outcomes in a 
</p>
<p>cost-effective manner. These models and common adaptations are discussed in the 
</p>
<p>next section.
</p>
<p> The Collaborative Care Model
</p>
<p> Structure
</p>
<p>The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is an evidence-based model of mental 
</p>
<p>health service delivery in medical settings (Archer et&nbsp;al., 2012). The core CoCM 
</p>
<p>team includes the patient, a primary care provider (PCP) or other treating medical 
</p>
<p>providers, a behavioral health care manager (BHCM), and a psychiatric consultant. 
</p>
<p>Depending on the resources of each clinic, teams may sometimes include other 
</p>
<p>members, such as a psychologist or health navigator (see Fig.&nbsp;1). Each team mem-
</p>
<p>ber has a clearly defined role (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2018).

<p>in a registry and by delivering brief evidence-based behavioral interventions. The 
</p>
<p>psychiatric consultant supports the other team members by providing expertise 
</p>
<p>through weekly systematic case reviews with the BHCM to ensure appropriate diag-
</p>
<p>nosis and development of care plans for common mental disorders.
</p>
<p>A typical treatment course in the CoCM starts with identification of the patient 
</p>
<p>needing treatment. This may be done through systematic screening, for example, for 
</p>
<p>depression, or through the PCP&rsquo;s clinical assessment. Once the patient is identified, 
</p>
<p>the BHCM is responsible for engaging the patient, completing an initial mental 
</p>
<p>health assessment and adding the patient to a CoCM registry. The BHCM then 
</p>
<p>meets with the patient at regular intervals, typically every 2&nbsp;weeks in person or by 
</p>
<p>phone to assess symptoms and provide evidence-based counseling/psychotherapy 
</p>
<p>interventions like problem-solving therapy (PST), cognitive behavioral therapy 
</p>
<p>(CBT), and behavioral activation (BA). The BHCM is also responsible for continu-
</p>
<p>ously engaging the patient in his care, repeating behavioral health assessment mea-
</p>
<p>sures, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), tracking response to 
</p>
<p>treatment, and coordinating overall care for the patient.
</p>
<p>The role of the BHCM is essential, with timely follow-up within the first 4&nbsp;weeks 
</p>
<p>strongly predicting clinically significant improvement in depression within 6&nbsp;months 
</p>
<p>and a shorter time to improvement (Bao, Druss, Jung, Chan, &amp; Un&uuml;tzer, 2016). The 
</p>
<p>psychiatric consultant may or may not be collocated with the primary care team and 
</p>
<p>focuses the systematic weekly case review with the BHCM on intensifying the care 
</p>
<p>plans for those patients who are not responding to initial treatment interventions.
</p>
<p>Psychiatric case review in any given month is associated with twice the probabil-
</p>
<p>ity of receiving a new medication in the following month, indicating that systematic 
</p>
<p>case review reduces clinical inertia in the treatment of depression (Sowa et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2018). A full-time BHCM within a typical CoCM team would have an active casel-
</p>
<p>oad of 50&ndash;80 patients and receive 1&ndash;2&nbsp;h of support each week from the psychiatric 
</p>
<p>consultant through case reviews of 5&ndash;8 patients.
</p>
<p> Background and&nbsp;Evidence
</p>
<p>There are over 80 randomized controlled trials demonstrating that the CoCM is 
</p>
<p>more effective than care as usual for depression and anxiety disorders and a growing 
</p>
<p>evidence base that CoCM is effective for other mental disorders, such as substance 
</p>
<p>use disorders and bipolar disorder (Archer et&nbsp;al., 2012). The largest trial of CoCM, 
</p>
<p>the IMPACT study, demonstrated that CoCM was twice as effective as usual care 
</p>
<p>for treating depression in older adults in primary care settings (Un&uuml;tzer et&nbsp;al., 2002). 
</p>
<p>Additional studies have demonstrated that CoCM can achieve the Quadruple Aim of 
</p>
<p>health care system optimization: improved patient satisfaction, provider experience, 
</p>
<p>patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of care (Archer et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>The evidence base for CoCM continues to expand, and there is growing interest 
</p>
<p>in understanding how the effectiveness of CoCM compares to that of other models 
</p>
<p>S. Haack et al.</p>

</p>
<p>of integration. For example, a recent small study demonstrated that more patients 
</p>
<p>experienced a significant reduction in depression symptoms when treated in sites 
</p>
<p>that used the CoCM compared with sites using the colocation model (Blackmore 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p> Target
</p>
<p>CoCM has the strongest evidence base for its application in the treatment of depres-
</p>
<p>sion and anxiety (Archer et&nbsp; al., 2012). However, a recent summary showed that 
</p>
<p>other disorders can be effectively treated by CoCM including chronic pain, demen-
</p>
<p>tia, and depression with a variety of medical comorbidities including diabetes and 
</p>
<p>cardiac risk factors (Huffman, Niazi, Rundell, Sharpe, &amp; Katon, 2014).
</p>
<p>More recently, studies have demonstrated that CoCM can effectively address 
</p>
<p>substance use disorders in primary care settings (Watkins et&nbsp;al., 2017), ADHD in 
</p>
<p>pediatric populations (Myers, Stoep, Thompson, Zhou, &amp; Un&uuml;tzer, 2010), and ado-
</p>
<p>lescent depression (Richardson et&nbsp;al., 2014). CoCM has been shown to effectively 
</p>
<p>treat mental health conditions in racially and ethnically diverse clinical populations 
</p>
<p>(Angstman et&nbsp;al., 2015; Shao, Richie, &amp; Bailey, 2016), including Blacks/African- 
</p>
<p>Americans (Are&aacute;n et&nbsp; al., 2005; Un&uuml;tzer et&nbsp; al., 2002), Hispanics/Latinos (Hay, 
</p>
<p>Katon, Ell, Lee, &amp; Guterman, 2012; Miranda et&nbsp;al., 2003; Un&uuml;tzer et&nbsp;al., 2002), and 
</p>
<p>Asians/Asian-Americans (Ratzliff, Ni, Chan, Park, &amp; Un&uuml;tzer, 2013).
</p>
<p> Implementation and&nbsp;Resources Needed
</p>
<p>The Collaborative Care Model is a complex intervention requiring significant 
</p>
<p>resources for implementation. Successful collaborative care programs have all core 
</p>
<p>team members in place and focus on five core principles: patient-centered team 
</p>
<p>care, population-based care, measurement-based treatment to target, evidence- 
</p>
<p>based treatment, and accountable care (AIMS Center, 2018b).
</p>
<p> Patient-Centered Collaboration
</p>
<p>Collaborative care starts with the patient, partnering with the PCP, BHCM, and 
</p>
<p>psychiatric consultant to develop and follow a shared treatment plan. Clearly defined 
</p>
<p>roles for each team member are essential to the provision of effective and efficient 
</p>
<p>shared care.
</p>

<p>278
</p>
<p> Population-Based Care
</p>
<p>The team must define the caseload of patients who are in active treatment for an 
</p>
<p>identified mental health need. Using a registry to track this patient population allows 
</p>
<p>the CoCM team to manage care proactively for these patients in a fundamental shift 
</p>
<p>from treatment as usual, which often is provided reactively only to patients who 
</p>
<p>consistently engage in treatment. A CoCM registry includes demographic informa-
</p>
<p>tion about the patient, behavioral health screening results (e.g., Patient Health 
</p>
<p>Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression), and dates of clinical contacts.
</p>
<p> Measurement-Based Treatment to&nbsp;Target
</p>
<p>The CoCM team is structured to support the consistent use of measurement tools to 
</p>
<p>guide active treatment until clinical target goals are achieved. The landmark 
</p>
<p>STAR-D trial for depression showed that it can take up to four changes in treatment 
</p>
<p>before 70% of the population will have a response to treatment (Rush, 2007). The 
</p>
<p>routine implementation of measurement-based treatment to target, especially when 
</p>
<p>measurements are appropriately timed to support clinical decision-making and 
</p>
<p>prompt treatment changes, can improve clinical outcomes (Fortney et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Evidence-Based Care
</p>
<p>Patients are offered evidence-based treatments in a biopsychosocial approach to 
</p>
<p>mental health. The PCP initiates medication, the BHCM delivers behavioral or psy-
</p>
<p>chotherapeutic interventions, and the psychiatric consultant supports the PCP and 
</p>
<p>BHCM to guide the evidence-based treatment most appropriate for the working 
</p>
<p>diagnosis.
</p>
<p> Accountable Care
</p>
<p>CoCM is not only accountable to the individual patient but to the entire identified 
</p>
<p>population. To achieve excellence in care, the whole team must commit to continu-
</p>
<p>ously improving the quality of care provided. This process starts with the team 
</p>
<p>identifying goals and targets for collaborative care and then regularly reviewing 
</p>
<p>program data to assess the effectiveness of treatments delivered. Quality measures 
</p>
<p>might address processes (e.g., caseload size or number of actively engaged patients), 
</p>
<p>outcomes (e.g., the percentage of patients achieving treatment response or remis-
</p>
<p>sion of depression symptoms), and other important targets identified by the clinic 
</p>
<p>(e.g., provider and patient satisfaction). The team monitors its progress and can use 
</p>
<p>standard quality improvement strategies to address areas in need of improvement. 
</p>
<p>High-quality CoCM delivery includes this continuous quality improvement process 
</p>
<p>as standard practice.
</p>
<p>S. Haack et al.</p>

</p>
<p>There is now a growing literature on the factors that facilitate strong implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of CoCM.&nbsp;One study examined the relationship between implementation fac-
</p>
<p>tors, the likelihood that patients were engaged in CoCM care, and positive depression 
</p>
<p>outcomes (Whitebird et&nbsp; al., 2014). It found that patient engagement was signifi-
</p>
<p>cantly correlated to the clinic having good leadership support, a strong PCP cham-
</p>
<p>pion, a care manager whose role is both well-defined and implemented, and a care 
</p>
<p>manager who is on-site and accessible. Depression remission was correlated with 
</p>
<p>having an engaged psychiatrist, warm handoffs, and operating costs not being seen 
</p>
<p>as a barrier.
</p>
<p>Additionally, pay for performance metrics may improve outcomes in real-world 
</p>
<p>implementation of CoCM (Un&uuml;tzer et&nbsp; al., 2012). In this analysis of safety-net 
</p>
<p>clinics who implemented CoCM, it took 64&nbsp;weeks to achieve clinically significant 
</p>
<p>improvement in depression in 50% of patients. After the payer mandated that 25% 
</p>
<p>of the payment to clinics for collaborative care be dependent on performance in five 
</p>
<p>key quality metrics, time to depression improvement was reduced to 24&nbsp; weeks. 
</p>
<p>These types of strategies can help guide improvement efforts in clinical practices 
</p>
<p>implementing the CoCM.
</p>
<p>There are a number of national and federal resources that support implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of CoCM.&nbsp;American Psychiatric Association (2018) offers resources on team 
</p>
<p>training, implementation, and financing for CoCM.&nbsp;The UW AIMS Center (2018a) 
</p>
<p>provides resources to support training and implementation. The American Medical 
</p>
<p>Association provides a stepped approach to behavioral health integration (Drake &amp; 
</p>
<p>Valenstein, 2018) as do the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Korsen 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp; al., 2018) and the SAMHSA-HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions 
</p>
<p>(2018). Interested readers should see additional books on CoCM team care delivery 
</p>
<p>and its implementation (Raney, Bergman, Torous, &amp; Hasselberg, 2017; Raney, 
</p>
<p>Lasky, &amp; Scott, 2017; Ratzliff, Un&uuml;tzer, Katon, &amp; Stephens, 2016).
</p>
<p> Challenges/Limitations
</p>
<p>In addition to the steps required to successful implementation noted in the previous 
</p>
<p>section, a common challenge for CoCM is obtaining adequate financial reimburse-
</p>
<p>ment of the costs of team-based approaches. Several of the team processes in CoCM, 
</p>
<p>such as telephone outreach calls to patients, time spent on team communication, and 
</p>
<p>the systematic case reviews, are not billable through traditional fee-for-service billing 
</p>
<p>approaches. CoCM costs have been covered through a variety of strategies to date: 
</p>
<p>grants, services delivered in fully capitated systems, partial capitated payment (i.e., 
</p>
<p>the PCP continues fee-for-service billing, and the BHCM and psychiatric consultant 
</p>
<p>are paid through adjusted case rate), bundled monthly payment rate, and billing fee-
</p>
<p>for-service for all billable services (Carlo, Un&uuml;tzer, Ratzliff, &amp; Cerimele, 2018).
</p>
<p>Encouragingly, a new payment opportunity was introduced in 2017 when CPT 
</p>
<p>codes were introduced by Medicare to pay for the CoCM (Press et&nbsp;al., 2017). These 
</p>
<p>Integration of&nbsp;Primary Care and&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>280
</p>
<p>codes are billed by and paid to the PCP for the work of the whole collaborative care 
</p>
<p>team including the work of the BHCM and psychiatric consultant. The team must 
</p>
<p>track minutes spent over the course of a calendar month and must deliver the core 
</p>
<p>components of CoCM to be eligible to bill these codes (Centers for Medicare &amp; 
</p>
<p>Medicaid Services, 2018).
</p>
<p> Real-World Program Example
</p>
<p>The Depression Improvement Across Minnesota&mdash;Offering a New Direction 
</p>
<p>(DIAMOND) is an example of a large real-world implementation of CoCM through-
</p>
<p>out Minnesota and western Wisconsin (Whitebird et&nbsp;al., 2014). The structure of the 
</p>
<p>initiative was based largely on CoCM as it was tested in the IMPACT study. It 
</p>
<p>focused on six components: (1) use of the PHQ-9 for assessment and ongoing moni-
</p>
<p>toring; (2) use of a registry for systematic tracking of patients; (3) use of evidence- 
</p>
<p>based guidelines to provide stepped care treatment modification/intensification; (4) 
</p>
<p>relapse prevention education; (5) a care manager located in the clinic to provide 
</p>
<p>education, care coordination, behavioral activation approaches, and support of med-
</p>
<p>ication management; and (6) a consulting psychiatrist to meet with the care man-
</p>
<p>ager for weekly case review and treatment change recommendations.
</p>
<p>Training was provided by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI), 
</p>
<p>who systematically provided standardized training in implementing collaborative 
</p>
<p>depression care and consultative support for primary care clinics over the course of 
</p>
<p>2&nbsp;years. Payment for care delivery was provided through a partnership with nearly 
</p>
<p>all commercial health plans in the state. Each clinic provided standardized monthly 
</p>
<p>data reports through a common Internet portal about the number of patients seen by 
</p>
<p>the care manager, the number enrolled in DIAMOND, and the PHQ-9 scores to 
</p>
<p>monitor depression response and remission rates. On average, 23% of patients 
</p>
<p>engaged in the program had remission from depression symptoms at 6&nbsp;months.
</p>
<p> Primary Care Behavioral Health Model
</p>
<p> History/Background
</p>
<p>The development of the Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) model was a clini-
</p>
<p>cally based movement, with the goal of reducing the behavioral health services gap. 
</p>
<p>Robinson and Strosahl (2009), two pioneers of the PCBH model, led integration 
</p>
<p>efforts in the 1980s at Group Health Cooperative (GHC) of Puget Sound and then a 
</p>
<p>consumer-owned and consumer-led Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) in 
</p>
<p>Seattle, in response to an organizational leadership mandate to explore behavioral 
</p>
<p>health integration.
</p>
<p>S. Haack et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>281
</p>
<p>This call for integration was itself a response to widespread GHC primary care 
</p>
<p>provider dissatisfaction with the organization&rsquo;s existing mental health services. By 
</p>
<p>shifting treatment away from diagnosis-based treatment toward a focus on the 
</p>
<p>patient&rsquo;s functional outcomes and life satisfaction, creation of psychologist-led 
</p>
<p>interventions for depression treatment that could be delivered in less than 3&nbsp;h total, 
</p>
<p>and the development of team-based behavioral health services in the primary care 
</p>
<p>setting, the PCBH movement evolved.
</p>
<p>Since its conception, the PCBH model of care has grown considerably over more 
</p>
<p>than 30&nbsp;years in a multitude of organizations. The US Air Force, US Navy, Kaiser 
</p>
<p>Permanente, Veterans Health Administration, Cherokee Health System, and 
</p>
<p>Southcentral Foundation are among the organizations that currently employ 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) in their primary care clinics. Perhaps largely 
</p>
<p>due to the grassroots beginnings of the PCBH model, there are many variations in 
</p>
<p>the models used in these and other facilities (Hunter et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>As the model has grown, so have efforts to formally describe and measure the 
</p>
<p>model. The first comprehensive text on the subject, Behavioral Consultation and 
</p>
<p>Primary Care, written in 2007, is now in its second edition (Robinson &amp; Reiter, 
</p>
<p>2016). Acknowledging the inconsistent use of terminology and varying model com-
</p>
<p>ponents, PCBH leaders have recently created a concise definition of the model, with 
</p>
<p>the first part of this definition reproduced here (Reiter, Dobmeyer, &amp; Hunter, 2018, 
</p>
<p>p.&nbsp;112):
</p>
<p>The PCBH model is a team-based primary care approach to managing behavioral health 
problems and biopsychosocially influenced health conditions. The model&rsquo;s main goal is to 
enhance the primary care team&rsquo;s ability to manage and treat such problems/conditions, with 
resulting improvements in primary care services for the entire clinic population. The model 
incorporates into the primary care team a behavioral health consultant (BHC), sometimes 
referred to as a behavioral health clinician, to extend and support the primary care provider 
(PCP) and team&hellip;
</p>
<p> Evidence Base
</p>
<p>Given the clinical grassroots inception of the PCBH model, its evidence base is still 
</p>
<p>developing, but there is encouraging evidence of its impact on patient outcomes and 
</p>
<p>implementation efficacy. Recently Hunter et&nbsp;al. (2018) summarized the available 
</p>
<p>literature in a descriptive review of 20 articles that examined PCBH model out-
</p>
<p>comes, with most of the reviewed studies using a pre/post design.
</p>
<p>The PCBH model has demonstrated improvements in clinical outcomes. 
</p>
<p>Regarding specific disorders, PCBH patients have experienced improvements in 
</p>
<p>depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms (Angantyr, Rimner, Norden, &amp; Norlander, 
</p>
<p>2015; Cigrang et&nbsp;al., 2015; Hunter et&nbsp;al., 2018). There is also some initial evidence 
</p>
<p>that the PCBH model addresses insomnia, tobacco use, and weight loss, with one 
</p>
<p>study each indicating improvement in symptoms in small trials (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lt;30) (Goodie, 
</p>
<p>Isler, Hunter, &amp; Peterson, 2009; Sadock, Auerbach, Rybarczyk, &amp; Aggarwal, 2014). 
</p>
<p>Integration of&nbsp;Primary Care and&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>282
</p>
<p>However, within small samples, one of these same studies also failed to show 
</p>
<p>improvement in sleep (n=&nbsp;4) or pain (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;9) (Sadock, et&nbsp;al., 2014). Suicidal ideation 
</p>
<p>has also decreased in those receiving PCBH care (Bryan, Morrow, &amp; Appolonio, 
</p>
<p>2009). These results demonstrate promising, albeit early, evidence of the PCBH 
</p>
<p>model&rsquo;s efficacy.
</p>
<p>Patients&rsquo; overall functioning and care satisfaction has also improved with engage-
</p>
<p>ment in the PCBH model. One pediatric study indicated less global distress with 
</p>
<p>PCBH care (Gomez et&nbsp;al., 2014). PCBH patients&rsquo; satisfaction has been high in mul-
</p>
<p>tiple studies, although one limitation of this conclusion is that most studies have 
</p>
<p>used locally made self-questionnaires without psychometric data (Hunter et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2018).
</p>
<p>Beyond patient-specific outcomes, the PCBH model also has been tested for its 
</p>
<p>implementation properties. Fourteen studies have demonstrated a variety of 
</p>
<p>implementation- related outcomes, including high provider satisfaction, positive 
</p>
<p>shifts in PCP practice habits, and increased patient engagement in outside mental 
</p>
<p>health referrals after involvement in the PCBH program (Hunter et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>Lanoye et&nbsp;al. (2017) demonstrated decreases in preventable inpatient hospitaliza-
</p>
<p>tions among those receiving PCBH care, which could be taken as encouraging evi-
</p>
<p>dence of cost-saving ability within the model. Gouge, Polaha, Rogers, and Harden 
</p>
<p>(2016) also found the model demonstrated improved financial viability: a pediatrics 
</p>
<p>practice was able to earn $1142 more on days with an on-site BHC, thought to be 
</p>
<p>due to providers&rsquo; increased efficiency in seeing more patients when BHCs were 
</p>
<p>present and acting as &ldquo;physician extenders.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Structure and&nbsp;Targets
</p>
<p>Robinson and Reiter (2016) elucidate the PCBH components in the GATHER acro-
</p>
<p>nym (Table&nbsp;1). BHCs aim to impact the health of a clinic&rsquo;s population through a 
</p>
<p>generalist approach: they will effectively assist all patients with all problems, with 
</p>
<p>a focus on concerns that are behaviorally or biopsychosocially influenced. 
</p>
<p>Intervention examples include sleep hygiene habits for insomnia, behavioral

</p>
<p>activation techniques for depression, mindfulness activities for anxiety disorders, 
</p>
<p>and working on drinking diaries or action plans for alcohol misuse. Skills are deliv-
</p>
<p>ered with a &ldquo;here and now&rdquo; approach, as the PCBH model prioritizes BHC acces-
</p>
<p>sibility to ensure the patient can have assistance in addressing his problem in real 
</p>
<p>time, ideally the same day that he is referred.
</p>
<p>Team-based refers to the integrated nature of the care delivery. While the BHC 
</p>
<p>has a lead role in doing the behavioral intervention, they are still part of a care team 
</p>
<p>that may include the primary care provider, nurse, and others. The team prioritizes 
</p>
<p>regular communication about patients&rsquo; care needs, has a consistent, integrated care 
</p>
<p>plan for shared patients, and uses workflows that facilitate consistent and effective 
</p>
<p>transitions between team members. With an integrated team approach and a popula-
</p>
<p>tion focus, high volume of care can be achieved. BHCs may see patients one or two 
</p>
<p>times only for 15&ndash;30&nbsp;min per interaction, averaging 10&ndash;14 patients per day with one 
</p>
<p>visit being the modal number per patient served by a BHC (Reiter et&nbsp;al., 2018). In 
</p>
<p>part due to this population-based approach, BHCs aim to provide active interven-
</p>
<p>tions and skills in each visit, including the first visit. Delivering effective interven-
</p>
<p>tions in only one visit enables the BHC to serve the entire clinical population more 
</p>
<p>efficiently.
</p>
<p>With the other GATHER pieces in place, the BHC role can also be that of an 
</p>
<p>educator. By addressing a broad array of biopsychosocially influenced concerns 
</p>
<p>with shared patients, the BHC can help the whole care team improve their behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health aptitude over time. When providers consistently and reliably involve 
</p>
<p>BHCs in patients&rsquo; care (routine) through standardized care pathways, this facilitates 
</p>
<p>the educational component of the BHC&rsquo;s role, as providers will begin to see com-
</p>
<p>mon interventional components for different behaviorally influenced concerns.
</p>
<p>The BHC is often a psychologist or master&rsquo;s level therapist by training, growing 
</p>
<p>from its beginnings as a psychologist-created model. Involvement from psychia-
</p>
<p>trists in this model is not classically discussed or consistent in practice, although 
</p>
<p>many best practice sites do indeed involve psychiatric consultation in a collocated 
</p>
<p>or integrated manner (Cohen, Davis, Hall, Gilchrist, &amp; Miller, 2015).
</p>
<p> Implementation and&nbsp;Resources Needed
</p>
<p>Considerations for a successful PCBH program include organizational, interper-
</p>
<p>sonal, and individual staff-level needs. Shifting the focus from providing resources 
</p>
<p>to patients with only obvious or severe mental health concerns to care for all patients 
</p>
<p>with behaviorally influenced conditions requires commitment from all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>On the organizational level, a truly integrated PCBH program must ensure the pro-
</p>
<p>gram&rsquo;s alignment with the organization&rsquo;s mission and values. This alignment 
</p>
<p>enables quality improvement processes, financial backing, and appropriate staffing 
</p>
<p>of the program to occur. An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report of 
</p>
<p>exemplary programs noted that successful PCBH organizations supported their 
</p>
<p>programs with structured clinical workflows, shared physical workspaces, and 
</p>
<p>Integration of&nbsp;Primary Care and&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>284
</p>
<p>shared information infrastructures (e.g., electronic health records) (Cohen et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2015).
</p>
<p>Examining interpersonal practices among programs, this same report found that 
</p>
<p>effective PCBH models developed clinical workflows that included interdisciplin-
</p>
<p>ary communication and clear care pathways, as well as timely access to BHCs for 
</p>
<p>both planned appointments and unplanned patient concerns. This last point requires 
</p>
<p>a delicate balance of maintaining some scheduled visits, as well as allotting time for 
</p>
<p>the BHC to contribute to unexpected care situations.
</p>
<p>For the BHC specifically, initial and continued training needs is of utmost 
</p>
<p>importance. Robinson and Reiter (2016) define the core competencies for BHCs as 
</p>
<p>brief intervention skills, pathway service skills, documentation skills, consultation 
</p>
<p>skills, team performance skills, practice management skills, and administrative 
</p>
<p>knowledge and skills. These BHC core competencies have not traditionally been a 
</p>
<p>focus of curricula for social work, psychology, or marriage or family therapy pro-
</p>
<p>grams. This led to the development of a variety of training initiatives for both 
</p>
<p>individuals still in training and those already licensed to practice who want to shift 
</p>
<p>into a BHC role. Adding training to graduate programs, new certificate programs, 
</p>
<p>curricula from the American Psychological Association, community-based train-
</p>
<p>ings, and self-study options are some examples of these training approaches, with 
</p>
<p>many of these resources outlined in a recent review (Serrano, Cordes, Cubic, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Daub, 2018). Once in practice as a BHC, ongoing supervision to ensure continued 
</p>
<p>model fidelity and general support is also critical to the BHC&rsquo;s continued evolution 
</p>
<p>of skills.
</p>
<p> Real-World Program Example
</p>
<p>The Southcentral Foundation (SCF), an Alaska Native-owned nonprofit health care 
</p>
<p>organization based in Anchorage, Alaska, offers primary care and specialty services 
</p>
<p>to nearly 65,000 Alaska Native and American Indian individuals (Southcentral 
</p>
<p>Foundation, 2018). As a cornerstone of their integrated behavioral health services, 
</p>
<p>the Southcentral Foundation trialed incorporation of BHCs into several primary 
</p>
<p>care clinics over 10&nbsp;years ago (Southcentral Foundation, 2017). With positive feed-
</p>
<p>back from primary care providers and patients, the number and role of BHCs 
</p>
<p>expanded, and they are now a presence throughout the organization&rsquo;s primary care 
</p>
<p>clinics.
</p>
<p>Starting in 2012, warm handoffs and same-day services were emphasized, which 
</p>
<p>the organization has found reduced the wait time and need for traditional behavioral 
</p>
<p>health service referrals. Southcentral Foundation customer owners (e.g., individuals 
</p>
<p>referred to as patients in other health care organizations) may see a BHC one or 
</p>
<p>more times, depending on the customer owner&rsquo;s specific needs. BHCs at SCF 
</p>
<p>encounter patients with a variety of behaviorally influenced concerns, offering treat-
</p>
<p>ments ranging from biofeedback for enhancing mindfulness in an anxious individual

</p>
<p>to building a relationship with a customer owner with first-break psychosis to 
</p>
<p>facilitate further behavioral health service engagement (author (SH) personal 
</p>
<p>experience).
</p>
<p>Time is balanced between scheduled appointments with customer owners and 
</p>
<p>availability for immediate referrals from PCPs by employing a call schedule where 
</p>
<p>the BHCs rotate who will be the &ldquo;on call&rdquo; providers for the day. BHC availability, 
</p>
<p>along with other integrated strategies that include the presence of collocated psy-
</p>
<p>chiatrists within the primary care clinics, has led to improved wait times for cus-
</p>
<p>tomer owners who do need referrals to behavioral health services beyond what the 
</p>
<p>BHCs can offer. Wait times have decreased from a 42&nbsp;day average to a 7&ndash;28&nbsp;day 
</p>
<p>maximum post-BHC integration. BHCs also likely contribute to the high satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion rate of 96% among customer owners with the care they receive at (Southcentral 
</p>
<p>Foundation, 2017).
</p>
<p> Primary Care for&nbsp;Patients with&nbsp;Serious Mental Illnesses 
</p>
<p>in&nbsp;Mental Health Care Settings
</p>
<p> History and&nbsp;Background
</p>
<p>Having a serious mental illness (SMI) elevates the risk for multiple medical issues 
</p>
<p>and premature death (Alakeson, Frank, &amp; Katz, 2010). SMI typically is defined as 
</p>
<p>the subset of any mental illness that causes substantial functional impairment in one 
</p>
<p>or more of life&rsquo;s domains. Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and mood 
</p>
<p>disorders, such as major depressive or bipolar disorders, often fall within the SMI 
</p>
<p>distinction. SMI&rsquo;s broad impact on health and risk for premature death may be 
</p>
<p>partly due to limited access to preventative and primary care services (Cook et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2015). Patients with SMI are more often hospitalized for preventable medical ill-
</p>
<p>ness and have chronic conditions that are poorly controlled (Druss &amp; von Esenwein, 
</p>
<p>2006).
</p>
<p>Multiple barriers can exist in obtaining primary care services for patients with 
</p>
<p>SMI, including the impact of SMI on health behaviors and a patient&rsquo;s understanding 
</p>
<p>of their health care needs, as well as perceived stigma in PCP settings toward 
</p>
<p>patients with SMI (Alakeson et&nbsp;al., 2010; Cook et&nbsp;al., 2015; Druss &amp; von Esenwein, 
</p>
<p>2006). Integrating primary care services into mental health clinics enables patients 
</p>
<p>who may be engaged in care in their mental health center, but not in a primary care 
</p>
<p>clinic, to receive integrated services simultaneously to address their mental health 
</p>
<p>and other chronic health conditions in a more patient-centric manner.
</p>
<p>To integrate services in this manner, a primary care provider (i.e., physician, 
</p>
<p>nurse practitioner, or physician&rsquo;s assistant) typically is embedded in a mental health 
</p>
<p>care clinic. Patients are often seen by a physically onsite PCP at the mental 
</p>
<p>health care clinic, but they are also seen via telehealth in some programs. The 
</p>
<p>Integration of&nbsp;Primary Care and&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>286
</p>
<p>PCPs&rsquo; provided services typically include annual physical exams and diagnosis and 
</p>
<p>treatment of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and other chronic medical 
</p>
<p>conditions.
</p>
<p>There is a spectrum of integration within this care model. Some programs deliver 
</p>
<p>primarily collocated care, with the primary care and behavioral health teams work-
</p>
<p>ing independently or occasionally attending care team meetings together. When 
</p>
<p>care is more integrated, patient panels may be formally co-managed, multidisci-
</p>
<p>plinary team meetings regularly occur, and workflows are shared. To encourage 
</p>
<p>shared management of patient needs, a registry may be used to track laboratory 
</p>
<p>results and record return visit dates for patients.
</p>
<p> Data and&nbsp;Evidence
</p>
<p>The goals of integrating primary care services for patients with SMI are consistent 
</p>
<p>with the Quadruple Aim&rsquo;s focus on improved clinical outcomes, cost-efficacy, 
</p>
<p>patient satisfaction, and provider experience.
</p>
<p>A study of 752 patients with SMI in 2 integrated behavioral health clinics, 1 
</p>
<p>established and 1 new, evaluated hospital utilization and costs (Breslau et&nbsp;al., 2018). 
</p>
<p>In the established integrated care clinic, patients receiving integrated care services 
</p>
<p>had reduced inpatient hospital admissions after enrollment in the integrated pro-
</p>
<p>gram, as compared to non-enrolled patients in the clinic. However, in the second 
</p>
<p>clinic with a new integrated care program, this reduction in hospitalization did not 
</p>
<p>materialize. A trend in decreased inpatient hospitalization costs for patients receiv-
</p>
<p>ing integrated care services also occurred in the established clinic only. Neither 
</p>
<p>clinic saw a reduction in emergency room visits or costs. These results indicate the 
</p>
<p>benefit of an established integrated care program toward reducing hospital days and 
</p>
<p>its costs.
</p>
<p>Outcomes for several chronic medical conditions have also been evaluated within 
</p>
<p>this model. A quasi-experimental difference of design study compared three pri-
</p>
<p>mary care integrated behavioral health care sites to control clinics (Scharf et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2016). The patients in integrated care clinics possessed healthier cholesterol levels 
</p>
<p>after 1&nbsp;year, but no other significant impacts were demonstrated for other medical 
</p>
<p>disorders. Another randomized controlled trial found that while the integrated 
</p>
<p>model improved quality of care, it did not improve medical markers of health (Druss 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2017). Finally, a quasi-experimental study found that integrated primary care 
</p>
<p>services resulted in a slight reduction in emergency department visits and psychiat-
</p>
<p>ric hospitalization, as well as an increase in diabetes monitoring (Rodgers et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2016). While this is a promising model, more data is needed to further assess its 
</p>
<p>overall efficacy.

</p>
<p> Implementation and&nbsp;Resources
</p>
<p>Hiring, training, and logistical considerations all need be considered to develop a 
</p>
<p>successful integration program. Related to hiring, this model requires hiring and/or 
</p>
<p>training primary and preventative care staff to provide on-site assessments while 
</p>
<p>also ensuring that the primary care and behavioral health providers have a basic 
</p>
<p>understanding of each other&rsquo;s roles. When present, medical support staff, such as 
</p>
<p>medical assistants or peer counselors, may also require training to provide services 
</p>
<p>within the mental health care clinic.
</p>
<p>Beyond hiring and training needs, infrastructure should also be thoughtfully 
</p>
<p>developed. When a registry or panel is used for tracking patients&rsquo; progress, this can 
</p>
<p>require effort to create and implement. As part of seeing patients, the primary care 
</p>
<p>provider will also need to have dedicated space with medical equipment that is usu-
</p>
<p>ally not found in psychiatric clinics (e.g., an ophthalmoscope, a medical exam table, 
</p>
<p>phlebotomy equipment).
</p>
<p>For a more thorough discussion of the necessary pieces to launch integrated pri-
</p>
<p>mary care in behavioral health settings, the reader is directed to the SAMHSA- 
</p>
<p>HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions (2018).
</p>
<p> Limitations
</p>
<p>While integrating primary care into mental health settings demonstrates promise for 
</p>
<p>lessening the health outcomes gaps between people with and without SMI, this 
</p>
<p>model does have several challenges to address. Its evidence base is still developing, 
</p>
<p>as it has limited controlled studies and outcomes data. One challenge to broadening 
</p>
<p>the evidence base is that there is variability among the components and workflows 
</p>
<p>of programs in practice. In terms of necessary resources, additional or repurposed 
</p>
<p>space in a mental health care clinic is required, which can be challenging in some 
</p>
<p>clinics. Finally, regular communication between the primary care and behavioral 
</p>
<p>health team members can be difficult in busy clinics, which can lead to siloed care 
</p>
<p>or unintegrated care plans (Rodgers et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p> Emerging Approaches to&nbsp;Integration
</p>
<p>As was described in the chapter&rsquo;s introduction, integration can be understood as a 
</p>
<p>spectrum of strategies for overcoming systemic care fragmentation. While CoCM 
</p>
<p>and PCBH represent two of the more widespread and recognized models of inte-
</p>
<p>grated behavioral health care, the wider universe of potential approaches is always 
</p>
<p>expanding. This section seeks to highlight several constellations of approaches and 
</p>
<p>practices that hint at the range of possible forms of integration.
</p>
<p>Integration of&nbsp;Primary Care and&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>288
</p>
<p> Elaborating on&nbsp;Existing Models
</p>
<p>Some integration approaches share significant overlap with the models described 
</p>
<p>above. For example, it is possible to create programs that effectively &ldquo;blend&rdquo; key 
</p>
<p>elements of CoCM and PCBH models, providing access to both (1) rapid assess-
</p>
<p>ment and management of acute, time-limited stressors, or crises and (2) the capacity 
</p>
<p>for assessment and treatment of identified psychiatric conditions within a more 
</p>
<p>comprehensive, population-based behavioral health program. While such &ldquo;blended&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>approaches have not yet been rigorously studied, pragmatic experimentation in this 
</p>
<p>area is ongoing and encouraged by leaders in the field (Un&uuml;tzer, 2016).
</p>
<p>Other approaches have already received more rigorous study, such as TEAMcare, 
</p>
<p>which like CoCM, was built upon Wagner&rsquo;s chronic care model. In Katon et&nbsp;al.&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>(2010) seminal single-blind randomized controlled trial, a TEAMcare intervention 
</p>
<p>versus usual care was studied in 14 primary care clinics and included 214 adult 
</p>
<p>patients with comorbid depression and coronary heart disease and/or poorly con-
</p>
<p>trolled diabetes. The intervention sought to provide patients and their primary care 
</p>
<p>teams with a combination of enhanced behavioral health and general medical treat-
</p>
<p>ment support using an on-site nurse who was supported by primary care physicians 
</p>
<p>and psychiatrists through population-based consultation. As with CoCM, the 
</p>
<p>TEAMcare approach was shown to facilitate active treatment changes and lead to 
</p>
<p>improved metabolic (A1c, cholesterol), cardiovascular (systolic blood pressure), 
</p>
<p>and depression (SCL-20) measures while also increasing patients&rsquo; satisfaction with 
</p>
<p>care and improving their overall quality of life (Katon et&nbsp;al., 2010; Ratzliff et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2016).
</p>
<p>There is also the potential to develop fully integrated health homes and even 
</p>
<p>larger-scale community-level integrated health programs, wherein a nearly com-
</p>
<p>plete range of integrated general medical and behavioral health services are pro-
</p>
<p>vided directly in the same clinical and community settings. Particularly in 
</p>
<p>environments, such as US health care systems, where behavioral health and general 
</p>
<p>medical care have historically occupied rather distinct institutional and cultural 
</p>
<p>spaces, developing such fully integrated programs requires extensive coordination, 
</p>
<p>planning, institutional support, financial realignment, and cultural shifts. Successful 
</p>
<p>ongoing efforts to create and develop such systems in the US context include 
</p>
<p>Cherokee Health Systems (2018) and the state of Vermont (2018).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, there may be other situations in which an upskilled primary care 
</p>
<p>workforce is called upon to provide integrated general medical and behavioral 
</p>
<p>health care without ready access to other professionals. Such circumstances include 
</p>
<p>situations in which (1) symptom severity and complexity are sufficiently low, (2) 
</p>
<p>access to local specialists or other integrated care resources are limited, and/or (3) a 
</p>
<p>patient&rsquo;s care preferences limit access to other forms of integration. In such 
</p>
<p>instances, additional support in terms of training and clinical resources can be 
</p>
<p>invaluable (American Academy of Family Physicians, 2018).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>289
</p>
<p> Innovating for&nbsp;Specific Populations and&nbsp;Conditions
</p>
<p>It is possible, as well, to develop integrated approaches that respond to the unique 
</p>
<p>needs and circumstances of specific populations, with the population defined by 
</p>
<p>some combination of behavioral health conditions and sociocultural factors. This 
</p>
<p>was noted, above, in discussing the implementation of primary care services within 
</p>
<p>mental health settings for individuals with SMI wherein specialty mental health 
</p>
<p>clinics were identified by patients as their primary health home.
</p>
<p>The integrated treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) represents another 
</p>
<p>such example. Due to factors such as elevated social stigma and institutional- 
</p>
<p>structural features of health care systems, the treatment of SUDs is often separated 
</p>
<p>from other general outpatient medical care (Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). 
</p>
<p>However, experience in primary care and with partial integration efforts, such as 
</p>
<p>Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) programs, have 
</p>
<p>demonstrated that referral to treatment in separate specialty addictions treatment 
</p>
<p>centers constitutes a significant barrier to initiating and maintaining patients in 
</p>
<p>treatment for SUDs (Kim et&nbsp;al., 2017; Saitz et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p>In response, there have been efforts to incorporate treatment directly into pri-
</p>
<p>mary care that have demonstrated improved health outcomes. For example, in one 
</p>
<p>study of US military veterans diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in US 
</p>
<p>Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC), primary care clinics were ran-
</p>
<p>domized to two groups. One group was comprised of intervention clinics who 
</p>
<p>offered patients with AUD primary care-based treatment (i.e., counseling and access 
</p>
<p>to oral naltrexone to alcohol curb cravings); the second group was usual care clinics 
</p>
<p>who offered referrals to a VAMC outpatient specialty addictions clinic&rsquo;s intensive 
</p>
<p>outpatient treatment program. Patients treated in primary care demonstrated 
</p>
<p>improved treatment engagement and reduction in heavy drinking days relative to 
</p>
<p>those referred to traditional specialty care (Oslin et&nbsp;al., 2014). This finding appears 
</p>
<p>to be driven largely by the low rate of successful initial engagement after referral to 
</p>
<p>non-primary care-based treatment, as opposed to a deficiency in the treatment pro-
</p>
<p>vided for those who were able to engage in specialty care.
</p>
<p>Others have sought to adapt CoCM principles and techniques to SUD treatment. 
</p>
<p>The SUMMIT trial showed increased receipt of evidence-based treatments and self- 
</p>
<p>reported 30-day abstinence among patients with AUD and/or opioid use disorder 
</p>
<p>(OUD) who were randomized to CoCM versus usual care. These benefits were 
</p>
<p>observed despite surprisingly low use of medication-assisted treatment in both 
</p>
<p>groups (Watkins et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p>The successful and more widely disseminated Massachusetts Model of 
</p>
<p>Collaborative Care for OUD relies heavily on primary care-based nurse care man-
</p>
<p>agers, working in coordination with their clinic&rsquo;s primary care providers and a 
</p>
<p>program- level coordinator, to support, monitor, and manage of patients with OUD 
</p>
<p>who are being treated with buprenorphine-naloxone in primary care. This scalable 
</p>
<p>and efficient approach shows evidence of greater than 50% retention in treatment at 
</p>
<p>Integration of&nbsp;Primary Care and&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>290
</p>
<p>1&nbsp; year with 95% reduction in illicit opioid use for those remaining in treatment 
</p>
<p>(Alford et&nbsp;al., 2011; LaBelle, Han, Bergeron, &amp; Samet, 2016).
</p>
<p>Finally, the Vermont Hub-and-Spoke model for OUD treatment relies on larger 
</p>
<p>health care system redesign that enables integration of specialty addictions treat-
</p>
<p>ment and primary care and facilitates a more seamless flow of patients and resources 
</p>
<p>across a continuum of treatment contexts, according to an individual patient&rsquo;s clini-
</p>
<p>cal needs. In this model, regional specialty addictions centers serve as hubs that 
</p>
<p>provide assessment, assistance with treatment initiation, ongoing education, and 
</p>
<p>coordination-of-care transfers to support networks, or &ldquo;spokes,&rdquo; of primary care 
</p>
<p>clinics (Vermont Agency of Human Services &amp; Vermont Blueprint for Health, 
</p>
<p>2012).
</p>
<p>Spokes are eligible for in-clinic nurse and case manager staff assistance, as well 
</p>
<p>as access to hub-based addiction treatment expertise and the opportunity to partici-
</p>
<p>pate in a statewide virtual &ldquo;learning collaborative.&rdquo; This program has facilitated 
</p>
<p>primary care workforce expansion, allowed for same-day access to treatment in 
</p>
<p>many regions, increased access to and appropriate use of OUD medication-assisted 
</p>
<p>treatment, facilitated retention in treatment, and enabled timely care transitions 
</p>
<p>between specialty and primary care settings (Cimaglio, 2015; State of Vermont, 
</p>
<p>2018; Vermont Agency of Human Services &amp; Vermont Blueprint for Health, 2012).
</p>
<p> Leveraging Technology
</p>
<p>Finally, the increasing role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) 
</p>
<p>in facilitating multiple different approaches to care integration should be acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged. Even beyond the use of electronic health records and clinical registries that 
</p>
<p>support CoCM and other established integrated care approaches, ICTs, in the form 
</p>
<p>of a rapidly expanding array of &ldquo;telehealth&rdquo; modalities, are being leveraged to bring 
</p>
<p>behavioral health into non-behavioral clinical and community settings.
</p>
<p>The oldest of these is synchronous two-way interactive video-based virtual 
</p>
<p>encounters between patients and behavioral health specialists, often referred to as 
</p>
<p>telepsychiatry (Shore, 2015). Early experimentation in the late 1950s and 1960s 
</p>
<p>with closed circuit analog videoconferencing was followed by decades of limited 
</p>
<p>use, before telepsychiatry and telemental health, more generally, saw a resurgence 
</p>
<p>in the 1990s and 2000s. In recent years, this has been accelerated though access to 
</p>
<p>digital web-based platforms (Chan, Parish, &amp; Yellowlees, 2015).
</p>
<p>Today, direct patient-to-clinician synchronous videoconferencing is incorporated 
</p>
<p>into multiple integrated care approaches, including CoCM (Fortney et&nbsp; al., 2015; 
</p>
<p>Turvey &amp; Fortney, 2017). In addition, there is a growing use of digital electronic 
</p>
<p>consultation platforms used for both (1) synchronous and asynchronous consulta-
</p>
<p>tion between a remote behavioral health specialist and a primary care clinician 
</p>
<p>regarding the clinical care of individual patients in primary care and (2) population- 
</p>
<p>based consultation through &ldquo;remote telehubs&rdquo; (Raney, Lasky, et&nbsp;al., 2017). While

</p>
<p>the former has not yet been rigorously studied, there are high-quality studies 
</p>
<p> indicating the effectiveness of the latter in CoCM (Fortney et&nbsp;al., 2013). There is 
</p>
<p>also increasing experience with and emerging evidence for the use of learning col-
</p>
<p>laboratives, such as Project ECHO, to facilitate telementoring and shared learning 
</p>
<p>among behavioral health experts and primary care clinicians with the goal of sup-
</p>
<p>porting local practice change and improved patient outcomes (Fisher et&nbsp;al., 2017; 
</p>
<p>Hager et&nbsp;al., 2018).
</p>
<p>Finally, there are emerging opportunities to leverage access to patients outside of 
</p>
<p>traditional clinical settings. In recent years, this has been an area of significant 
</p>
<p>research and commercial interest, expanding in large part through the proliferation 
</p>
<p>of sophisticated mobile devices and other web-based technologies. These devices 
</p>
<p>and technologies enable new patterns of communication and can generate complex 
</p>
<p>mixed datasets using patient-generated and passively collected data. These, in com-
</p>
<p>bination with powerful new data management and analysis techniques, are begin-
</p>
<p>ning to generate new opportunities for diagnostic clarification, decision support, 
</p>
<p>treatment delivery, and monitoring treatment progress (Hallgren, Bauer, &amp; Atkins, 
</p>
<p>2017; Raney, Bergman, et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>The established models and emerging approaches described in this chapter attest to 
</p>
<p>the range of possibilities for integrating of primary care and behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices (Table&nbsp;2). Many of the challenges that led to the need for integration initially 
</p>
<p>remain true to this day. These include behavioral health workforce shortages, stigma 
</p>
<p>related to mental health conditions, lack of coordination among treatment teams, 
</p>
<p>high rates of undetected and untreated psychiatric conditions, and rising health care 
</p>
<p>costs, among other ongoing issues. Different integrated care models offer a variety 
</p>
<p>of innovative responses to these challenges, with strengths and limitations specific 
</p>
<p>to each model. Although CoCM has achieved a strong evidence base, it still requires 
</p>
<p>significant resources to appropriately implement and maintain a high-fidelity 
</p>
<p>program.
</p>
<p>While there is a less-established evidence base for the PCBH model, there is 
</p>
<p>nonetheless some compelling evidence, as well as an implicit endorsement of the 
</p>
<p>PCBH model&rsquo;s utility, as evidenced by its use in many large US health care systems. 
</p>
<p>For individuals with SMI, integrating primary care services into the behavioral 
</p>
<p>health settings that patients are comfortable in can enable the delivery of fundamen-
</p>
<p>tal primary and preventative services for this vulnerable population. Blended 
</p>
<p>approaches to integration also exist beyond these models, with variations on the 
</p>
<p>strategies and practices used to deliver comprehensive care to patients.
</p>
<p>Innovations in integrated care will continue. Ideally, this movement will be 
</p>
<p>guided by a balance in employing evidence-based approaches while also acknowl-
</p>
<p>edging that each organization&rsquo;s culture, resources, and other unique features will

<p>Rural Behavioral Health Services
</p>

</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Health and behavioral health care in America have come under increasing scrutiny 
</p>
<p>during the last half of the twentieth century and beginning of the twenty-first cen-
</p>
<p>tury from a vast array of stakeholders, including consumers, providers, employers, 
</p>
<p>community leaders, policymakers, administrators, educators, as well as lawmakers 
</p>
<p>at the state and federal levels of government. Proposals for national and state health 
</p>
<p>care reform have been encouraged, in part, by the need to control the rising costs of 
</p>
<p>health and behavioral health care and to address the obstacles and inequities in 
</p>
<p>accessing health and behavioral health services. Although the United States 
</p>
<p>Congress passed major comprehensive health care reform legislation in 2010 with 
</p>
<p>the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, PL 111&ndash;148), significant 
</p>
<p>health care initiatives (particularly in association with entitlement programs) have 
</p>
<p>been proposed and implemented by various individual states.
</p>
<p>Historically, individuals who live in rural and frontier areas in America have 
</p>
<p>significant and often times distinct health and behavioral health care needs, but have 
</p>
<p>experienced numerous obstacles in obtaining these services. These numerous chal-
</p>
<p>lenges include the lack of accessible services (e.g., social isolation, significant geo-
</p>
<p>graphical distances, and inhospitable climates), a general scarcity of resources and

</p>
<p>the absence of a human services infrastructure, severe shortages of service  providers, 
</p>
<p>the absence of service specialization (availability of services), the inappropriate 
</p>
<p>organization of services based upon urban (metropolitan) delivery system models, 
</p>
<p>and inefficient communication (including diversity of languages and sub-cultures) 
</p>
<p>to disseminate information and coordinate care.
</p>
<p>These rural health care delivery barriers become even more complex with the 
</p>
<p>provision of rural (and particularly frontier) behavioral health services, since behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health services delivery has historically faced problems of stigma (among 
</p>
<p>health providers, consumers, and employers), poor integration with physical (or 
</p>
<p>somatic) health services, unique language and cultural challenges to treatment, as 
</p>
<p>well as substantial reliance on public sector funding.
</p>
<p>This chapter presents an overview of the major challenges in the provision of 
</p>
<p>rural behavioral health services in the United States. It also identifies what we see 
</p>
<p>as the most important issues facing rural behavioral health services delivery in the 
</p>
<p>foreseeable future.
</p>
<p> Defining Rural and&nbsp;Frontier Areas
</p>
<p>Rural America encompasses 97% of the land area of the United States and contains 
</p>
<p>60 million residents (19% of the U.S. population) (Ratcliffe, Burd, Holder, &amp; Fields, 
</p>
<p>2016). Furthermore, 10 states in the United States have 40% or more of their popu-
</p>
<p>lation who live in rural or frontier areas.1 The most rural populations of America are 
</p>
<p>spread across almost 2500 counties heavily concentrated in the South and the 
</p>
<p>Midwest.
</p>
<p>Factors contributing to the decrease in rural America include migration of young 
</p>
<p>adults to more urban areas, fewer births, increased mortality among working adults, 
</p>
<p>an aging population, and re-classification of previously rural areas to urbanized and 
</p>
<p>urban areas (Cromartie, 2017).
</p>
<p>Basing its definition upon residential population density and land-use characteris-
</p>
<p>tics, the U.S.&nbsp;Census Bureau defines rural as &ldquo;all population, housing, and territory not 
</p>
<p>included within an urbanized area or urban cluster&rdquo; (Ratcliffe et&nbsp;al., 2016, p.&nbsp;3). The 
</p>
<p>Census Bureau defines territory within tracts, which may contain both rural and urban 
</p>
<p>areas, and its Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes characterize the nation&rsquo;s Census 
</p>
<p>tracts. Since the U.&nbsp;S. rural population abides in housing subdivisions on the edge of 
</p>
<p>urban centers, in densely settled small towns, and in sparsely populated or remote areas, 
</p>
<p>rural categories can be classed as mostly urban, mostly rural, or completely rural.
</p>
<p>The Census Bureau also uses other measures to assist others in understanding the 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic diversity of rural America. These include the Rural-Urban 
</p>
<p>Continuum Codes, Urban-Influence Codes, Natural Amenities Scale, and the ERS 
</p>
<p>1 (Maine (61%), Vermont (61%), West Virginia (51%), Mississippi (50%), Montana (44%), 
</p>
<p>Arkansas (43%), South Dakota (43%), Kentucky (41%), Alabama (40%), and North Dakota 
</p>
<p>(40%).

</p>
<p>Typology Codes. Of especial interest to behavioral health are the ERS Typologies 
</p>
<p>Codes, which examine six policy-relevant class areas (education, employment, per-
</p>
<p>sistent poverty and persistent child poverty, population loss, and retirement destina-
</p>
<p>tion) in addition to six economic dependence categories (Cromartie, 2017). This can 
</p>
<p>make understanding rural issues challenging.
</p>
<p>To further complicate matters, there is no standard, universally used definition 
</p>
<p>for frontier and remote (FAR) areas. While a FAR is commonly defined as six or 
</p>
<p>fewer people per square mile, there are other factors that also may define an area as 
</p>
<p>a FAR. In addition to population density, other factors include distance from a spe-
</p>
<p>cific service point or a population center, travel time, availability of paved roads, 
</p>
<p>and seasonal changes that may affect access to services. In 2007, the National 
</p>
<p>Center for Frontier Communities (2007) created a consensus definition using a 
</p>
<p>weighted matrix that utilized density (persons per square mile), distance (miles to 
</p>
<p>supermarket), and travel time (minutes to supermarket). Building upon this model, 
</p>
<p>the Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) and the U.S.&nbsp;Department of Agriculture 
</p>
<p>(USDA) developed the Frontier and Remote Areas (FAR) methodology, which uses 
</p>
<p>ZIP-code-level frontier and remote area (FAR) codes to assist with policy and 
</p>
<p>research (Economic Research Service, 2017). The FAR methodology utilizes travel 
</p>
<p>time to nearby urban areas (population centers) to create a four-level categorical 
</p>
<p>schema. The levels are based on access to high order services (level one), low order 
</p>
<p>services (level four), and intermediate order services (levels two and three). Section 
</p>
<p>10324(B1-II) of the ACA defines a &ldquo;Frontier State&rdquo; where &ldquo;at least 50 percent of the 
</p>
<p>counties in the State are frontier counties&hellip;counties in which the population per 
</p>
<p>square mile is less than 6&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;841).
</p>
<p> Rural Behavioral Health Services
</p>
<p>Historically, health and behavioral health services have been largely concentrated in 
</p>
<p>large, urban areas of America. Hence, the basic organizational models for health 
</p>
<p>and behavioral health services delivery have been based upon urban at-risk popula-
</p>
<p>tions. The same can be said of professional and graduate education and training 
</p>
<p>programs for health and behavioral health practitioners, many of which evolved in 
</p>
<p>major metropolitan universities and hospitals. Few graduate training programs have 
</p>
<p>concentrations in rural behavioral health, separate certification, or other credential-
</p>
<p>ing programs.
</p>
<p>There is significant variability and heterogeneity in rural environments through-
</p>
<p>out the United States. Every rural community is unique, with its own at-risk popula-
</p>
<p>tions as well as its underlying economic, historical, political, cultural, and social 
</p>
<p>structures, collectively contributing to diverse patterns of health and behavioral 
</p>
<p>health problems. Population characteristics and the economic base in the rural 
</p>
<p>Southwest will differ significantly when compared to population characteristics in 
</p>
<p>rural Appalachia, Northern New England, the South, the Great Plains, or in the 
</p>
<p>Frontier West. Moreover, no single systems delivery model of rural health and 
</p>
<p>Rural Behavioral Health Services</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>304
</p>
<p>behavioral health services could be expected to serve all rural and frontier areas in 
</p>
<p>the United States, just as there is no single systems delivery model for urban health 
</p>
<p>and behavioral health services.
</p>
<p>Collectively, rural populations in America have unique characteristics that impact 
</p>
<p>issues of accessibility, availability, and acceptability of health and behavioral health 
</p>
<p>services. Issues include sociodemographic differences (e.g., income, poverty, and 
</p>
<p>education), geographic differences (distance to care), cultural differences (rural vs. 
</p>
<p>urban), and perceptual differences (e.g., stigma surrounding mental illnesses).
</p>
<p>Hospitals in rural areas tend to be smaller, older facilities that serve a higher 
</p>
<p>proportion of unemployed, lower income, uninsured, or publicly insured individuals 
</p>
<p>compared to urban hospitals (Phillips &amp; Moylan, 2017). Hence, rural areas often 
</p>
<p>have disproportionate populations dependent upon Medicare and Medicaid pro-
</p>
<p>grams (Foutz, Artiga, &amp; Garfield, 2017). Nearly two-thirds of uninsured people in 
</p>
<p>rural areas live in a state that did not implement the ACA Medicaid expansion. Since 
</p>
<p>uninsured or underinsured rural individuals are disproportionally affected by state 
</p>
<p>decisions to not implement the expansion option, they may have fewer affordable 
</p>
<p>coverage options to obtain care early (prevention) or until they are in a crisis mode 
</p>
<p>(Newkirk &amp; Damico, 2014).
</p>
<p>More basic problems, such as insufficient transportation, electricity, water, and 
</p>
<p>communication systems, have only complicated the process of providing and using 
</p>
<p>rural health and behavioral health services.
</p>
<p>Investment in health infrastructure is critical to improving quality of care and 
</p>
<p>reducing disparities in the delivery of care to rural Americans (Seigel, 2018). This 
</p>
<p>investment is critical to care for the number of rural residents who suffer from men-
</p>
<p>tal illnesses, alcohol abuse, and substance use disorders.
</p>
<p> Epidemiology
</p>
<p>Rural populations have historically experienced increased rates of alcohol abuse, 
</p>
<p>substance use, child and spousal abuse, and depression. However, one of the basic 
</p>
<p>problems facing the rural behavioral health services research field involves the esti-
</p>
<p>mation of the prevalence of behavioral disorders in individuals who live in rural and 
</p>
<p>frontier areas as well as subsequent rural versus urban prevalence comparisons. The 
</p>
<p>lack of definitive conclusions and study findings have been attributed, in part, to the 
</p>
<p>variability in definitions (of both rural/urban areas and of behavioral disorders), 
</p>
<p>sampling design (including potential differences in the age, ethnicity, and/or racial 
</p>
<p>characteristics of the population), measurement (e.g., treated prevalence versus true 
</p>
<p>prevalence), source of data, and the type of instrument utilized in rural behavioral 
</p>
<p>health studies. Studies on mental illnesses may or may not include substance use 
</p>
<p>disorders or co-occurring disorders. Studies may fail to address what level of sever-
</p>
<p>ity is being examined (mild, moderate, or serious) and whether the population is 
</p>
<p>being examined over a 12-month period or a lifetime.

</p>
<p>Of the total percent of adults identified with a mental disorder in the United 
</p>
<p>States, for example, it is estimated that 40.4% experienced mild disorders, 37.3% 
</p>
<p>experienced moderate disorders, and 22.3% experienced serious mental disorders 
</p>
<p>(Bagalman &amp; Napili, 2018). Estimates of 12-month prevalence of mental illnesses 
</p>
<p>are 24.8% among adults and estimates of 12-month prevalence of mental illnesses 
</p>
<p>including substance use disorders among adults are 32.4% (Druss et&nbsp; al., 2009). 
</p>
<p>However, these estimates may not always differentiate among rural, urban, or sub-
</p>
<p>urban populations or areas.
</p>
<p>SAMHSA reports almost 20% (over 6.5 million) of residents living in non- 
</p>
<p>metropolitan counties suffered from one or more behavioral health problems during 
</p>
<p>2016 (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2017). Symptoms related 
</p>
<p>to anxiety disorders, trauma, cognitive disorders, behavioral disorders, and psy-
</p>
<p>chotic disorders are often comparable to urban residents (CBHSQ, 2017), however, 
</p>
<p>suicide rates in rural areas have surpassed urban suicide rates (Ivey-Stephenson, 
</p>
<p>Crosby, Jack, Haileyesus, &amp; Kresnow-Sedacca, 2017).
</p>
<p>In addition, the highest per capita rates of complex co-occurring disorders (COD) 
</p>
<p>were found in rural areas (Somers, Moniruzzaman, Rezansoff, Brink, &amp; Russolillo, 
</p>
<p>2016). Further, rural residents who are female, poor, elderly, belong to a cultural, 
</p>
<p>racial, or ethnic minority, or who are unemployed have an increased likelihood of 
</p>
<p>experiencing behavioral health problems (Bardach, Tarasenko, &amp; Schoenberg, 
</p>
<p>2011; Burholt &amp; Scharf, 2014; Cummings, Wen, Ko, &amp; Druss, 2013, 2014; Tjaden, 
</p>
<p>2015; Wielen et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p>The stress of ranching and farming has been a major problem in selected rural 
</p>
<p>areas of America. The threat of losing family land, a home, a family, experiencing 
</p>
<p>severe weather problems, and the constant preoccupation with uncertain crop pro-
</p>
<p>duction creates major stressors on many ranch and farm families. Accidents, equip-
</p>
<p>ment problems, social isolation, and irregular cash flow can produce unhealthy 
</p>
<p>emotional reactions, often in association with behavioral and/or somatic disorders. 
</p>
<p>Added stress and depression, suicidal tendencies, and substance abuse all increase 
</p>
<p>the probability of already above average work-related accidents and contribute to 
</p>
<p>the exacerbation of physical health conditions.
</p>
<p> Obstacles to&nbsp;Services Delivery
</p>
<p>The number of obstacles rural residents face in obtaining behavioral health services 
</p>
<p>results in increased disparities compared to urban residents. It is well-established 
</p>
<p>the need to implement adequate services in non-metropolitan areas was and remains 
</p>
<p>a critical national behavioral health imperative (Roberts, Battaglia, &amp; Epstein, 1999; 
</p>
<p>Seigel, 2018; Wilson, Bangs, &amp; Hatting, 2015). The availability of behavioral health 
</p>
<p>services and service providers, the accessibility to services, the acceptability of 
</p>
<p>these services to rural residents, and the utilization and costs of specialty services 
</p>
<p>remain critical factors in rural behavioral health services delivery.

</p>
<p>Rural American families have difficulty managing multiple health care needs due 
</p>
<p>to a number of structural reasons. These challenges include: higher numbers of 
</p>
<p>individuals without health care insurance or who are underinsured; fewer primary 
</p>
<p>and specialty providers; time, geography, and transportation challenges; and com-
</p>
<p>munity and employment disenfranchisement (Barker, Londeree, McBride, Kemper, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Mueller, 2013; Chavez, Kelleher, Matson, Wickizer, &amp; Chisolm, 2018; Monnat &amp; 
</p>
<p>Beeler Pickett, 2011; Weinhold &amp; Gurtner, 2014).
</p>
<p>Rural poverty and persistent rural poverty are problematic. Across all four 
</p>
<p>regions of the United States (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), poverty rates 
</p>
<p>were consistently higher for those living in rural areas (Semega, Fontenot, &amp; Kollar, 
</p>
<p>2017). Further, persistent poverty, defined as a poverty rate of 20% or greater for at 
</p>
<p>least four consecutive decades, is primarily a rural phenomenon, and 301 (85.3%) 
</p>
<p>counties experiencing persistent poverty in the USA are rural (Economic Research 
</p>
<p>Service, 2018). These structural barriers exacerbate the social determinants of 
</p>
<p>health for rural populations (National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and 
</p>
<p>Human Services, 2017).
</p>
<p>It is not surprising the overall availability and volume of behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices, programs, and providers increases with the population density of a commu-
</p>
<p>nity or area. Thus, the growth of behavioral health services in rural areas remains 
</p>
<p>limited. Residents of rural jurisdictions face significant health challenges, including 
</p>
<p>some of the highest rates of risky health behaviors and worst health outcomes of any 
</p>
<p>at-risk population in the country.
</p>
<p>In the next four sections, we borrow the framework of availability, accessibility, 
</p>
<p>affordability, and acceptability, first developed by Bushy and still relevant today, at 
</p>
<p>the level of national rural policy (Bushy, 1997; Wilson et&nbsp;al., 2015). Availability 
</p>
<p>examines staffing or service shortages which often limit the receipts of services. 
</p>
<p>Accessibility looks at coordination of services across the many sectors of the health, 
</p>
<p>behavioral health, and social service systems and transportation to those service 
</p>
<p>providers and/or facilities. Affordability involves the costs of care, such as direct and 
</p>
<p>indirect costs, and affording insurance that covers one&rsquo;s needs. Acceptability 
</p>
<p>addresses the persistent discrimination, perception, and stigma attached to the 
</p>
<p>receipt of or need for behavioral health services.
</p>
<p> Availability (Facilities and&nbsp;Staffing)
</p>
<p>Rural America has suffered from continual shortages of available behavioral health 
</p>
<p>and supportive services that, in turn, have restricted the array of behavioral health 
</p>
<p>services in rural areas. The availability of specialty behavioral health services has 
</p>
<p>been partially dependent upon the existence and availability of professionally 
</p>
<p>trained behavioral health providers. The Health Resources and Services 
</p>
<p>Administration uses Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) to define areas 
</p>
<p>with shortages of primary medical care, dental, or mental health providers and may 
</p>
<p>be geographic in nature (e.g., county or service area), population (e.g., low income,

</p>
<p>Medicaid eligible), or facilities (e.g., federally qualified health center). The Federal 
</p>
<p>definition for mental health HPSA requires the population-to-provider ratio must be 
</p>
<p>at least 30,000&ndash;1 (20,000 to 1 if there are unusually high needs in the community). 
</p>
<p>Mental health designations may qualify for designation based upon three criteria: 
</p>
<p>(1) the population to psychiatrist ratio, (2) the population to core mental health pro-
</p>
<p>vider (psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse 
</p>
<p>specialists, and marriage and family therapists) ratio, or (3) the population to both 
</p>
<p>psychiatrist and core mental health provider ratios (Bureau of Health Workforce, 
</p>
<p>2018).
</p>
<p>Over 60% of rural areas in the United States have been designated as federal 
</p>
<p>mental health professional shortage areas (MH HPSAs). Of the 5119 MH HPSAs in 
</p>
<p>the United States as of December 2017, there were 2718 rural MH HPSAs and 467 
</p>
<p>Partially Rural MH HPSAs across the ten HRSA regions. The total number of MH 
</p>
<p>practitioners needed to remove the HPSA designation are 5985 and 2257, respec-
</p>
<p>tively. To achieve target ratios of 10,000:1, an additional 5985 practitioners would 
</p>
<p>be required.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the sparseness of rural populations as well as geography limit 
</p>
<p>both the number of behavioral health providers as well as the diversity of behavioral 
</p>
<p>health specialists in rural areas. In turn, these shortages in behavioral health provid-
</p>
<p>ers as well as services significantly impact the organization and delivery of rural 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services. There are proportionately fewer behavioral health

</p>
<p> providers (psychologists, social workers, and counselors) living in rural areas, 
</p>
<p>regardless of education and training levels (Figs.&nbsp;1 and 2).
</p>
<p>With the rise of integrated health and behavioral health care, 40% of primary 
</p>
<p>care physicians were geographically co-located with behavioral health providers in 
</p>
<p>urban areas compared with co-located primary and behavioral health providers in 
</p>
<p>isolated rural areas (22.8%) and in frontier areas (26.5%) (Miller et&nbsp; al., 2014). 
</p>
<p>Although physicians often provide behavioral health care in the absence of behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health specialty providers, there are concerns by physicians they may not be 
</p>
<p>trained sufficiently to diagnosis or treat mental or substance use disorders. A survey 
</p>
<p>of family medicine physicians in rural Montana reported a number of self- limitations 
</p>
<p>in behavioral health services delivery, including lack of confidence or competence 
</p>
<p>and inadequate knowledge or training (Robohm, 2017).
</p>
<p>Even rural health clinics struggle to provide mental health services (Harris et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2016; Kosteniuk et&nbsp;al., 2014; Wright, Damiano, &amp; Bentler, 2015). A survey of Iowa 
</p>
<p>rural health centers reported difficulty hiring and retaining physicians (80%), physi-
</p>
<p>cian assistants, and nurse practitioners (both 50%), with referrals to specialists 
</p>
<p>being common. With the implementation of the ACA, almost 60% of respondents 
</p>
<p>also anticipated an increase in the size of their patient load; however, only 19% 
</p>
<p>believed they had the human, financial, and material resources necessary to respond 
</p>
<p>to those challenges (Wright et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p>Despite continuing efforts to recruit, staff, and retain rural behavioral health pro-
</p>
<p>fessionals from social work, psychology, psychiatry, and psychiatric nursing, efforts 
</p>
<p>at meeting the special needs of these behavioral health professionals have been

</p>
<p>areas of the United States.
</p>
<p> Accessibility (Coordination of&nbsp;Care and&nbsp;Community 
</p>
<p>and&nbsp;Social Supports)
</p>
<p>Rural residents often live farther away from health care resources and providers and 
</p>
<p>therefore must travel farther to obtain needed services (Meit et&nbsp;al., 2014). With only 
</p>
<p>a quarter of rural and frontier primary and behavioral health care providers co- 
</p>
<p>located, there is an increased need for coordination of hospital, provider, and 
</p>
<p>community- based services for persons with mental and substance use disorders. 
</p>
<p>Since patients receiving care in the specialty mental health sector are much more 
</p>
<p>likely to receive adequate care than patients receiving care in the general medical 
</p>
<p>sector only, rural individuals often receive poorer quality care (Agency for 
</p>
<p>Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), 2017).
</p>
<p> Emergency Room as&nbsp;Primary Care
</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for individuals living in rural areas to travel hundreds of miles 
</p>
<p>to seek inpatient behavioral health care because of the absence of emergency/24&nbsp;h 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services in their rural communities as well as the stigma still 
</p>
<p>attached to the treatment of mental illnesses. While approximately 30% of rural 
</p>
<p>individuals identified a hospital, emergency room, or clinic as a source of ongoing 
</p>
<p>care (AHRQ, 2017), 12% of rural residents use the emergency room (ER) for behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health treatment (Schroeder &amp; Leigh-Peterson, 2017). Approximately 75% of 
</p>
<p>rural residents present at the ER with a primary diagnosis of a mental disorder and 
</p>
<p>approximately 60% present with a primary diagnosis of a mental or substance use 
</p>
<p>disorder were more likely to be on public insurance. In addition, approximately 
</p>
<p>25% of rural elderly present to the ER with a mental health problem (Schroeder &amp; 
</p>
<p>Leigh-Peterson, 2017).
</p>
<p>The requirement to drive so far away to receive care and not be able to receive 
</p>
<p>referrals for continuity of care in one&rsquo;s local communities reduces rural residents&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>ability to have consistency in care, follow-up, and provider. Further, rural behavioral 
</p>
<p>health providers and agencies, often over-extended with large client caseloads, may 
</p>
<p>not have the time or expertise to seek additional or supplemental support for needed 
</p>
<p>programs, especially outside of their standard service area(s) or case management 
</p>
<p>partnerships, or for complex, co-occurring disorders (Mowbray, McBeath, Bank, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Newell, 2016; Nover, 2014). Mowbray et&nbsp;al. (2016) describe the challenges of coor-
</p>
<p>dinating behavioral health and social services to rural corrections-involved 
</p>
<p>populations.

</p>
<p> Integrated Care Coordination
</p>
<p>There remains heterogeneity in the organizational models of behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices delivery. For example, while some states and communities organize behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health services together with substance abuse services in a single agency, other 
</p>
<p>states have separate agencies for behavioral health and substance abuse services. In 
</p>
<p>addition, selected states house behavioral health and substance abuse services in an 
</p>
<p>umbrella human services agency.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the scarcity of rural behavioral health services and rural behavioral 
</p>
<p>health providers together with continual changes in the organization, financing, and 
</p>
<p>delivery of health and behavioral health services (through provider networks and 
</p>
<p>managed care) provides strong incentives for linking or integrating behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services with primary health care. Models include integrated provider teams 
</p>
<p>and collaboration and partnerships between behavioral health services and other 
</p>
<p>human services organizations through co-locations, site visits, shared facilities, and 
</p>
<p>joint staff activities. One benefit of integrated care is the &ldquo;medical cost offset effect&rdquo;, 
</p>
<p>or the decrease in medical care utilization and costs after the introduction of an 
</p>
<p>integrated behavioral health component within a comprehensive health care pro-
</p>
<p>gram, which can assist with the coordination of care for complex co-morbid condi-
</p>
<p>tions (Cummings, O&rsquo;Donohue, &amp; Cummings, 2009).
</p>
<p>Individuals with serious mental illness are at an increased risk for developing 
</p>
<p>co-morbid chronic physical illnesses. The CalMEND Pilot Collaborative to 
</p>
<p>Integrate Primary Care and Mental Health Services was an attempt to address the 
</p>
<p>needs of this population (Nover, 2014). Focused on quality assurance, intra- and 
</p>
<p>inter-agency teamwork, and access to adequate primary care for this population, the 
</p>
<p>CalMEND Pilot showed it was able to improve collaboration among the six CPCI 
</p>
<p>pilot partnerships by unifying primary care and behavioral health providers. It 
</p>
<p>focused on team- driven care with the design, development, and running of effective 
</p>
<p>care teams, implementing clinical workflows supportive of integrated care, and 
</p>
<p>improved care management among persons with complex, co-occurring disorders 
</p>
<p>(Nover, 2014). For additional reading on the integration of physical and behavioral 
</p>
<p>health care, see Chapter &ldquo;Integration of Primary Care and Behavioral Health&rdquo; in 
</p>

</p>
<p> Safety Net Clinics
</p>
<p>There are numerous challenges common to safety net clinics. These include limited 
</p>
<p>access to specialists for Medicaid and uninsured patients, difficulty communicating 
</p>
<p>with external providers, and payment models with limited support for care integra-
</p>
<p>tion activities (Derrett et&nbsp;al., 2014). A study of clinicians in 150 safety net primary

</p>
<p>care clinics in Washington State, primarily Federally Qualified Health Centers or 
</p>
<p>Rural Health Clinics, found that most respondents believed the integrated health/
</p>
<p>behavioral health program was beneficial (Williams, Eckstrom, Avery, &amp; Un&uuml;tzer, 
</p>
<p>2015). Rural respondents approved of the flexibility of the program when planning 
</p>
<p>care. However, social service limitations (e.g., housing or transportation services) 
</p>
<p>were identified more often as program limitations and a lack of awareness of pro-
</p>
<p>gram resources by other team members (Williams et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p> Telehealth, e-Health, and&nbsp;m-Health
</p>
<p>Considering many of the challenges in accessibility for residents of rural and fron-
</p>
<p>tier areas, telehealth and emerging e-/m-health technologies may be able to sur-
</p>
<p>mount these barriers. In their retrospective review of Medicare data, Mehrotra et&nbsp;al. 
</p>
<p>(2017) found the number of telemental health visits not only grew on average 45.1% 
</p>
<p>annually but by 2014, there were 5.3 and 11.8 telemental health visits per 100 rural 
</p>
<p>residents with mental illnesses. Residents who received telemental health services 
</p>
<p>tended to be younger, have disabilities, and live in poorer communities.
</p>
<p>Also, states with telemedicine parity laws and regulatory environments had sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly higher utilization than other states. In their review of Medicaid data in the 
</p>
<p>22 states with telehealth reimbursement, Douglas et&nbsp;al. (2017) found the highest 
</p>
<p>utilization of telemedicine (95%) was predominantly used to treat persons with 
</p>
<p>behavioral health diagnoses. Patients were more likely to live in a rural area with a 
</p>
<p>managed care plan, have an aged, blind, and disabled criteria, and be males 
</p>
<p>45&ndash;64&nbsp;years of age. Douglas and colleagues also determined that reimbursement 
</p>
<p>alone was not enough to drive the use of telemedicine; it is critical to more closely 
</p>
<p>examine state-specific reimbursement and licensure policies on telemedicine.
</p>
<p>These studies, with others, illustrate the challenges and issues involved in licens-
</p>
<p>ing, liability, and accreditation when it comes to the provision of mental health and 
</p>
<p>substance use services. For example, when six states in the nation allowed telemen-
</p>
<p>tal health counseling across state lines with full and reciprocal privileges, but due to 
</p>
<p>the states&rsquo; interpretation of Medicare/Medicaid rulings on telehealth reimburse-
</p>
<p>ment, providers receive unequal reimbursement for services rendered.
</p>
<p>Health care professionals have to address limitations in scope of practice, diffi-
</p>
<p>culties with in-state and interstate credentialing, lack of portability of practitioner 
</p>
<p>licenses, remote prescribing, not to mention immunity and liability issues that may 
</p>
<p>occur when dealing with emergency or crisis events. However, there is progress 
</p>
<p>being made. Since 2016, more states have addressed these key regulatory questions. 
</p>
<p>For example, Arkansas, Hawaii, Indiana, Louisiana, and Maine established regula-
</p>
<p>tions that allow patient relationships and evaluations to be established via real-time 
</p>
<p>audio and visual telehealth technologies (Epstein Becker Green, 2017).

</p>
<p> Affordability (Individual and&nbsp;System)
</p>
<p>Affordability involves the costs of care, and for many that centers on the affordabil-
</p>
<p>ity of health insurance. For others, affordability also examines system issues that 
</p>
<p>affect affordability of care, such as provider reimbursement, which affect availabil-
</p>
<p>ity of services and resources.
</p>
<p>Historically, individuals living in rural areas were more likely to have their men-
</p>
<p>tal health services paid for by public insurance and less likely paid by private insur-
</p>
<p>ance than individuals living in more urban areas. Today, rural individuals with 
</p>
<p>serious or persistent mental illnesses (SMI/SPMI) still remain more likely to have 
</p>
<p>their mental health services paid by public insurance. They were also more likely to 
</p>
<p>pay out-of-pocket costs compared to individuals with SMI living in urban areas 
</p>
<p>(Harman, Fortney, Dong, &amp; Xu, 2010).
</p>
<p>With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 
</p>
<p>2010 and Medicaid expansion, there have been more opportunities for rural indi-
</p>
<p>viduals to obtain health coverage for behavioral disorders. However, states that did 
</p>
<p>not accept Medicaid expansion created significant gaps in coverage as households, 
</p>
<p>with incomes between 18% and 99% of the federal poverty level (FPL) were ineli-
</p>
<p>gible for Medicaid or to enroll in the health insurance exchange (HIE) marketplace. 
</p>
<p>Rural residents were less likely than urban residents to use the Marketplace.
</p>
<p>In states, such as Texas, there were 1,101,000 adults in the insurance gap, 
</p>
<p>accounting for almost a quarter of all uninsured persons in Texas (Gong, Huey, 
</p>
<p>Johnson, Curti, &amp; Philips, 2016, 2017). The gap was significantly higher in rural 
</p>
<p>East and South Texas and in Texas as a whole. One-third of the enrollees previously 
</p>
<p>had private or employer-based insurance before enrollment into the Marketplace. 
</p>
<p>By 2014, the number of uninsured adults was reduced by 710,000, with two-thirds 
</p>
<p>of the enrollees in the Marketplace (Gong et&nbsp;al., 2016, 2017). In rural Wisconsin, 
</p>
<p>enrollments in public insurance led to substantial increases in outpatient visits but 
</p>
<p>not mental health visits (Burns et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p>How individuals chose health insurance plans may be related to a number of fac-
</p>
<p>tors, including comprehension of insurance terminology and language, numeracy, 
</p>
<p>consistency of options across choices, and the number of available plans. Hence, the 
</p>
<p>ability of an individual to choose an affordable option may depend upon improving 
</p>
<p>the consumer&rsquo;s ability to comprehend the intricacies of health insurance (Barnes, 
</p>
<p>Hanoch, &amp; Rice, 2015, 2016).
</p>
<p>Interventions designed to improve rates of mental health treatment, such as the 
</p>
<p>collaborative care models, are usually based on private payers, such as managed 
</p>
<p>care organizations which are less likely to operate in rural areas. However, in addi-
</p>
<p>tion to shortages of providers, third party payers have placed restrictions on both the 
</p>
<p>delivery and reimbursement of behavioral health services. For rural behavioral 
</p>
<p>health settings, this has primarily affected Medicare and Medicaid entitlement pro-
</p>
<p>grams. Although licensed behavioral health practitioners from various disciplines 
</p>
<p>may be reimbursed for behavioral health services, physicians continue to receive 
</p>

</p>
<p>supervisory and medication authority, legal responsibility, and accountability for 
</p>
<p>behavioral health treatment, despite the severe shortage of physicians trained and/or 
</p>
<p>interested in behavioral health treatment in rural areas. Furthermore, the particular 
</p>
<p>behavioral health providers who are &ldquo;approved&rdquo; to deliver behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices vary in terms of the health and behavioral health service settings, states, and 
</p>
<p>funding sources. This has been particularly important with the introduction of new 
</p>
<p>health care strategies and developing provider networks in rural areas in America.
</p>
<p> Acceptability (Values, Traditions, Culture)
</p>
<p>Acceptability refers to the provision of behavioral health services in a way that is 
</p>
<p>compatible with the values of the populations at-risk. Rural values, attitudes, and 
</p>
<p>traditions may limit the utilization of behavioral health services. Given the racial, 
</p>
<p>ethnic, and cultural diversity among rural populations, acceptability of behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services may be difficult to achieve for a number of reasons, including: estab-
</p>
<p>lished self-care practices; specific behavioral health etiologic beliefs; the lack of 
</p>
<p>knowledge about behavioral health services, gatekeeping, and treatment for these 
</p>
<p>services; and the location of behavioral health treatment settings.
</p>
<p>Acceptability of rural behavioral health services may also be influenced by the 
</p>
<p>urban education and training orientation of behavioral health providers. How prac-
</p>
<p>titioners learn to work with rural populations potentially affects the establishment of 
</p>
<p>trust during the construction of the behavioral health provider-consumer relation-
</p>
<p>ship. This relationship directly impacts the success of rural behavioral health out-
</p>
<p>reach and aftercare programs. If the rural behavioral health outreach providers are 
</p>
<p>viewed as community outsiders, then the helping relationship will not be estab-
</p>
<p>lished. Thus, careful recruiting and retaining of behavioral health professionals for 
</p>
<p>work in rural areas is critical in planning and implementing rural behavioral health 
</p>
<p>programs.
</p>
<p>Community acceptability is also critical for the survival and effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>rural behavioral health programs (Bushy, 1997). To help ensure that a program is 
</p>
<p>acceptable by a population at-risk for behavioral disorders, a community needs 
</p>
<p>assessment should be conducted prior to the planning and implementation of a new 
</p>
<p>rural behavioral health program. The collection and thorough understanding of cul-
</p>
<p>tural data is critical so that the provision of rural behavioral health services will be 
</p>
<p>made available in a manner consistent with the cultures of at-risk populations.
</p>
<p>Behavioral health providers should consider a number of factors for a rural 
</p>
<p>behavioral health needs assessment initiative, including: population density; travel; 
</p>
<p>time and work-related issues; customs, values, and traditions related to behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services; and patterns of natural events. Thus, behavioral health programs 
</p>
<p>will not thrive unless personal, employment, cultural, and enviro-behavioral factors 
</p>
<p>are taken into consideration.

</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>The shortage of rural behavioral health professionals, the limited availability of 
</p>
<p>behavioral health services, and the relative dependence upon government entitle-
</p>
<p>ment programs for the financing of rural and frontier behavioral health services has 
</p>
<p>contributed to significant problems for rural communities. These problems include: 
</p>
<p>rural residents not receiving needed behavioral health services; rural individuals not 
</p>
<p>receiving timely behavioral health services, potentially increasing the cost, dura-
</p>
<p>tion, and level of behavioral health care; and the provision of treatment for behav-
</p>
<p>ioral disorders in service settings far from the home community.
</p>
<p>The Rural Healthy People 2020 survey found that mental health and mental dis-
</p>
<p>orders remain the fourth most often identified rural health priority (Bolin et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2015). Many of the basic service delivery issues and challenges in the organization 
</p>
<p>and delivery of rural behavioral health services have not been addressed effectively 
</p>
<p>or consistently by policymakers and legislators.
</p>
<p>Two decades ago, Roberts et&nbsp;al. (1999) concluded the &ldquo;implementation of ade-
</p>
<p>quate services in non-metropolitan areas is a critical national health imperative.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>The California Rural Health Policy Council (1998) defined the ideal rural health 
</p>
<p>care delivery system as addressing three components. First, the system would inte-
</p>
<p>grate fully locally defined health- and prevention-related services. Second, it would 
</p>
<p>incorporate broad community engagement and collaboration. Finally, strategic 
</p>
<p>planning would be locally driven with measurable outcomes for the community.
</p>
<p>More recent recommendations, such as the emphasis on (re)building rural infra-
</p>
<p>structure from the National Rural Health Association (Seigel, 2018), again reinforce 
</p>
<p>what behavioral health providers, consumers, advocates, and researchers have 
</p>
<p>known for some time: although health care in the United States is generally viewed 
</p>
<p>by most in society as a right (of citizenship), behavioral health care is not a part of 
</p>
<p>that right.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the era of tremendous change in health and behavioral health care 
</p>
<p>will continue in the foreseeable future. While challenges remain in addressing 
</p>
<p>severe shortages in rural behavioral health providers as well as building successful 
</p>
<p>models of rural managed behavioral health services delivery, we see a strategic rural 
</p>
<p>focus on the following key elements in behavioral health services delivery:
</p>
<p> 1. continued consumer and family involvement in program, policy, and clinical 
</p>
<p>decision making and outcomes (MacDonald-Wilson, Schuster, &amp; Wasilchak, 
</p>
<p>2015; Nelson, Barr, &amp; Castaldo, 2015);
</p>
<p> 2. integration models that address patient centeredness and normative aspects of 
</p>
<p>care across functional, organizational, professional and service components 
</p>
<p>within integrated primary care/mental health programs (Bachrach, Boozang, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Davis, 2017; Bird, Lambert, Hartley, Beeson, &amp; Coburn, 1998; van der Klauw, 
</p>
<p>Molema, Grooten, &amp; Vrijhoef, 2014), and,
</p>
<p> 3. clinical, service provision, cultural, and management competence (or rural prac-
</p>
<p>tice expertise) of rural behavioral health providers, especially in the adoption and 
</p>
<p>implementation of evidence-based practices (Dotson et&nbsp; al., 2014; Weaver, 
</p>
<p>Capobianco, &amp; Ruffolo, 2015).

</p>
<p>Through public and private services delivery partnerships, coalitions of consum-
</p>
<p>ers and providers, integration of health and behavioral health providers and ser-
</p>
<p>vices, telecommunication technologies, and targeted as well as experiential 
</p>
<p>education and training programs for practitioners, rural and frontier communities 
</p>
<p>have the potential of building stronger, more vital behavioral health services.

Diverse Populations

</p>
<p>This chapter presents readers with a practical framework for making behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services and supports accessible and appropriate for culturally diverse popu-
</p>
<p>lations. It begins with an overview of important concepts, particularly behavioral 
</p>
<p>health disparities and health equity, which have shaped research and practice efforts 
</p>
<p>aimed at ensuring that all people receive the services and supports they need. It fol-
</p>
<p>lows with an examination of &ldquo;cultural competence&rdquo; as a concept and how it has 
</p>
<p>evolved. An implementation-based conceptual model is also presented, which oper-
</p>
<p>ationalizes cultural competence from an organizational perspective and discusses 
</p>
<p>issues with regard to its implementation in service delivery settings, as well as 
</p>
<p>implications for future research and practice.
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>The latter half of the twentieth century witnessed a growing recognition that rapid 
</p>
<p>changes in the cultural diversity of the population in the United States must be con-
</p>
<p>sidered when designing and implementing behavioral health services. Following 
</p>
<p>social movements that called for greater civic inclusion of minority groups during 
</p>
<p>the Civil Rights era, social scientists and health practitioners in the 1970s and 1980s 
</p>
<p>began highlighting persistent and troubling disparities in health status and access to 
</p>
<p>services among historically underserved populations. With regard to behavioral 
</p>
<p>health, research concerning the prevalence of mental illnesses among racial and 
</p>
<p>ethnic minority groups has found little difference in rates of specific disorders 
</p>
<p>but&nbsp; has documented differences in referral patterns, problem manifestations,

<p>applicability of assessment protocols, and diagnoses (Coard &amp; Holden, 1998; Yeh, 
</p>
<p>McCabe, Hough, Dupuis, &amp; Hazen, 2003). In addition, researchers have found the 
</p>
<p>burden of mental illness was higher for minority populations, who were found to be 
</p>
<p>persistently underserved and/or inappropriately served in this country&rsquo;s behavioral 
</p>
<p>health systems (Alegr&iacute;a et&nbsp;al., 2004; Chow, Jaffee, &amp; Snowden, 2003; Hough et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2002; Kataoka, Zhang, &amp; Wells, 2002; President&rsquo;s New Freedom Commission on 
</p>
<p>Mental Health, 2003).
</p>
<p>By 2005, the rapidly growing body of disparities research was focused more 
</p>
<p>specifically on examining the underlying social causes for consistent and adverse 
</p>
<p>behavioral health outcomes found in minority populations and more deliberately 
</p>
<p>identified them as health inequalities or differences understood to be &ldquo;avoidable, 
</p>
<p>unnecessary, and unjust&rdquo; (see Braveman, 2014, p.&nbsp;7; see also Whitehead, 1990). In 
</p>
<p>support of this position, researchers and policymakers in the United States are more 
</p>
<p>explicitly concentrating their contemporary efforts achieving on health equity, 
</p>
<p>defined at the federal level as:
</p>
<p>attainment of the highest level of health for all people. Achieving health equity requires 
</p>
<p>valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing societal efforts to address avoidable 
</p>
<p>inequalities, historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health and 
</p>
<p>healthcare disparities (Rollins, 2011, p.&nbsp;9)
</p>
<p>The ongoing development of knowledge regarding health equity has benefitted 
</p>
<p>from an examination of the complex roles that culture and society play with regard 
</p>
<p>to behavioral health, mental illnesses, and the delivery of services (US Department 
</p>
<p>of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2001). Understanding the universality of 
</p>
<p>culture within the human experience and its role in the formation of identity can 
</p>
<p>prepare behavioral health practitioners to understand the underlying social condi-
</p>
<p>tions that are now thought to cause and/or exacerbate disparities.
</p>
<p> What Is Culture?
</p>
<p>As with most theoretical concepts, culture is a complex, multifaceted one. It has 
</p>
<p>multiple definitions and aspects, used by a variety of professionals and disciplines, 
</p>
<p>and many of these definitions are interrelated and therefore nuanced in their differ-
</p>
<p>ences. Although there is no authoritative definition of culture, the most widely 
</p>
<p>accepted definition of the term and many of its variants are derived from the defini-
</p>
<p>tion first set forth in 1871, by Tyler (1923). More recent definitions include the 
</p>
<p>importance of symbolic representation or the unique human ability to invent mean-
</p>
<p>ings for observable phenomena (also known as &ldquo;cultural invention&rdquo;), to act as if 
</p>
<p>those meanings are true and to pass these meanings on to others (see Smedley &amp; 
</p>
<p>Smedley, 2005, p.&nbsp;17). We use the following definition to frame this chapter&rsquo;s dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of how culture shapes human experience and identity and thereby provide a 
</p>
<p>foundation for the development of more responsive behavioral health service deliv-
</p>
<p>ery processes for diverse populations:
</p>

</p>
<p>The system of shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that the members of 
</p>
<p>society use to cope with their world and with one another, and that are transmitted from 
</p>
<p>generation to generation through learning. (Bates &amp; Plog, 1990, p.&nbsp;7)
</p>
<p>Culture is therefore dynamic and changes over time, in response to ever- changing 
</p>
<p>environmental conditions (see Guarnaccia &amp; Rodriguez, 1996; Harris, 1968).
</p>
<p>Reframing the concept of culture in this way allows behavioral health practitio-
</p>
<p>ners and other professionals to more fully appreciate how categories and identities 
</p>
<p>that unify groups of people, such as &ldquo;race,&rdquo; &ldquo;ethnicity,&rdquo; &ldquo;gender,&rdquo; &ldquo;disability,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;age,&rdquo; and &ldquo;social class,&rdquo; are socially constructed and culturally reproduced over 
</p>
<p>time. The concept of race provides a useful vehicle for exploring how difference is 
</p>
<p>structured through the creation, development, and application of categories at a 
</p>
<p>national level. Although a discussion of the creation and development of race and 
</p>
<p>its application throughout the Americas is beyond the scope of this chapter, race has 
</p>
<p>been a defining feature of the social fabric of this country for centuries. Further, 
</p>
<p>although racial identity has largely been ascribed based on phenotypical character-
</p>
<p>istics, the ideology of race has emphasized the principle that racial differences are 
</p>
<p>biologically rooted thereby allowing for the proliferation of widespread belief that 
</p>
<p>differences between racial groups are genetically measurable (Fine, Ibrahim, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Thomas, 2005).
</p>
<p>Examination of the socially rooted aspect of race in the United States, in particu-
</p>
<p>lar, also allows behavioral health practitioners to understand how other identities, 
</p>
<p>such as gender identity or sexual identity, are often understood as biologically based 
</p>
<p>despite changing societal meanings associated with these categories (see Brooks &amp; 
</p>
<p>Bolzendahl, 2004; Diamond &amp; Butterworth, 2008; Drescher, 2009). Disability, age, 
</p>
<p>and social class may also be understood as cultures and, as such, are laden with 
</p>
<p>meanings and identities. Any of these identities, singly or in combination, may 
</p>
<p>influence the delivery and utilization of services.
</p>
<p>Researchers and practitioners have recommended the provision of culturally 
</p>
<p>competent services as a means of reducing behavioral health disparities and increas-
</p>
<p>ing health equity. However, the term has remained a largely philosophical concept 
</p>
<p>that lacks clarity with regard to operationalization in research and implementation 
</p>
<p>in practice. Operationalization of cultural competence is needed if behavioral health 
</p>
<p>researchers and practitioners are to continue relying on this concept for guidance on 
</p>
<p>how to reduce behavioral health disparities among diverse populations.
</p>
<p> Review of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Literature
</p>
<p>The concept of cultural competence in service delivery emerged in the late 1980s to 
</p>
<p>address what providers and researchers were finding in their work with diverse com-
</p>
<p>munities: adverse outcomes in behavioral health among &ldquo;minority&rdquo; populations. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most well-known definition is the one established by Cross, Bazron, 
</p>
<p>Dennis, and Isaacs in 1989. However, a number of researchers have questioned the 
</p>
<p>Reframing the&nbsp;Concept of&nbsp;Cultural Competence to&nbsp;Enhance Delivery of&nbsp;Behavioral&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>324
</p>
<p>utility of relying on the cultural competence concept for establishing clear-cut imple-
</p>
<p>mentation strategies that can direct behavioral health research and practice (see 
</p>
<p>Hernandez, Nesman, Mowery, Acevedo-Polakovich, &amp; Callejas, 2009; Kleinman &amp; 
</p>
<p>Benson, 2006; Saha et&nbsp;al., 2013). While the concept has gained widespread recogni-
</p>
<p>tion and provoked changes in thinking about serving diverse communities, cultural 
</p>
<p>competence has remained largely an ideology with a set of guiding principles that 
</p>
<p>lack clear operationalization (Saha et&nbsp;al., 2013; Vega &amp; Lopez, 2001). As Saha et&nbsp;al. 
</p>
<p>(2013, p. 626) argue, the proliferation of the concept in behavioral health and beyond 
</p>
<p>is &ldquo;largely based on expert opinions about the theoretical benefits [of the concept]&hellip; 
</p>
<p>rather than empirical research.&rdquo; Researchers have also been critical of the way in 
</p>
<p>which the cultural competence philosophy has developed over time, often leading to 
</p>
<p>training and workshops that focus on &ldquo;teaching about the &lsquo;cultures&rsquo; of non-white 
</p>
<p>racial and ethnic groups&rdquo; (Malat, 2013, p. 605).
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding best intentions, Malat (2013) argues that such training serves 
</p>
<p>to reinforce stereotypes as opposed to helping providers critically examine sys-
</p>
<p>temic issues, such as institutionalized racism, poverty, and, ultimately, persistent 
</p>
<p>social inequality, and how these factors may create and/or exacerbate behavioral 
</p>
<p>health disparities. In essence, this state of affairs can be seen as ensuring the con-
</p>
<p>tinuous promotion of cultural generalizations and racial stereotypes and, poten-
</p>
<p>tially, lending support (inadvertent though it might be) to a larger social environment 
</p>
<p>that can exacerbate negative differences in behavioral health outcomes among 
</p>
<p>diverse groups. Cultural competence therefore has gained status as an ideology; 
</p>
<p>yet, it has not resulted in a testable theory of its application or its ability to amelio-
</p>
<p>rate racial disparities (Malat, 2013). Interestingly, despite its lack of operationaliza-
</p>
<p>tion and because it has achieved ideological status, the concept of cultural 
</p>
<p>competence maintains a prominent position as a key concept in the behavioral 
</p>
<p>health field.
</p>
<p>In an effort to better operationalize the term, Hernandez et&nbsp;al. (2009, p. 1047) 
</p>
<p>established a definition that focuses specifically on implementation:
</p>
<p>[A]n organization&rsquo;s cultural competence can be described as the degree of compatibility 
</p>
<p>and adaptability between the cultural and linguistic characteristics of a community&rsquo;s popu-
</p>
<p>lation and the way the organization&rsquo;s combined policies, structures, and processes work 
</p>
<p>together to impede and/or facilitate access, availability and utilization of needed services 
</p>
<p>and supports.
</p>
<p> Presentation of&nbsp;Critical Issues: Conceptualizing Cultural 
</p>
<p>Competence as&nbsp;an&nbsp;Organizational Process
</p>
<p>This section presents a conceptual model that illustrates how organizational cultural 
</p>
<p>competence can be successfully implemented by focusing on the relationships 
</p>
<p>between a community&rsquo;s population(s), organizational structures and processes, and 
</p>
<p>direct services within a larger community context. The model was developed from 
</p>
<p>L. M. Callejas and M. Hernandez</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>325
</p>
<p>research conducted to examine implementation of culturally competent service 
</p>
<p>delivery on the part of behavioral health organizations across the country (Hernandez 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2009; Hernandez, Nesman, Isaacs, Callejas, &amp; Mowery, 2006). It organizes 
</p>
<p>the findings from a literature review that examined over 1100 articles on the topic of 
</p>
<p>cultural competence in behavioral health services for racially and ethnically diverse 
</p>
<p>populations in the United States. This review focused on identifying and describing 
</p>
<p>measurable factors associated with cultural competence in behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices and the relationships between the factors documented (Hernandez et&nbsp;al., 2006, 
</p>
<p>2009). The literature review was conducted as part of a larger study that focused on 
</p>
<p>identifying organizational practices designed to implement culturally competent 
</p>
<p>service delivery and reduce behavioral health disparities by improving service 
</p>
<p>accessibility.
</p>
<p>Figure 1 presents the conceptual model of organizational cultural competence, 
</p>
<p>which illustrates the relationships between diverse populations of behavioral health 
</p>
<p>service users and the key structures and processes of behavioral health organiza-
</p>
<p>tions, including their direct service functions and processes, as presented in our 
</p>
<p>definition established earlier. It further highlights the importance of the community 
</p>
<p>contexts that shape the way in which behavioral health services are delivered by 
</p>
<p>organizations (or systems) and received by the populations that need them. As Fig.&nbsp;1

</p>
<p>indicates, the compatibility between an organization and the population(s) it 
</p>
<p>serves&nbsp;determines the level of cultural competence and ultimately, a reduction in 
</p>
<p>behavioral health disparities within a given community. The remainder of this sec-
</p>
<p>tion outlines key components of the model (numbered for clarity) and discusses 
</p>
<p>how these components are thought to interact within a given community. Special 
</p>
<p>attention is given to the concept of &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; because of its central importance to an 
</p>
<p>understanding of cultural competence.
</p>
<p> Community Context
</p>
<p>As noted earlier, community context is central to this model; it is the setting within 
</p>
<p>which behavioral health organizations and the populations they serve exist and 
</p>
<p>interact with one another. The model also highlights the premise that all individuals 
</p>
<p>respond to their behavioral health issues within the context of a larger social envi-
</p>
<p>ronment. Community context can therefore affect the ways in which culturally 
</p>
<p>diverse individuals reach the services and supports they may need. For instance, 
</p>
<p>intrinsic characteristics generally associated with particular populations have been 
</p>
<p>found to affect access to services and the utilization of these services. These include 
</p>
<p>beliefs about disability, awareness of behavioral health needs, and understanding of 
</p>
<p>available services, or knowledge of how service systems work (Bailey, Skinner, 
</p>
<p>Rodriguez, Gut, &amp; Correa, 1999). Context is also shaped by the underlying social, 
</p>
<p>political, and economic conditions (often referred to as the social determinants of 
</p>
<p>health) in particular neighborhoods within the community or communities served 
</p>
<p>by an organization and which are understood by researchers as playing a critical 
</p>
<p>role in overall health and well-being (Barten, Mitlin, Mulholland, Hardoy, &amp; Stern, 
</p>
<p>2007; Shavers &amp; Shavers, 2006).
</p>
<p>Behavioral health organizations also operate within a larger context, which 
</p>
<p>includes the larger city, county, state, and national environments that affect their 
</p>
<p>efforts to serve diverse populations. One example is how implementation of 
</p>
<p>Federal policy varies across states in the delivery and utilization of services. 
</p>
<p>Different interpretation of the laws regarding mental health parity in benefits man-
</p>
<p>agement by plans, providers, and governments (state and Federal) may adversely 
</p>
<p>affect utilization of services based on severity of diagnoses (Busch et&nbsp;al., 2012). 
</p>
<p>Behavioral health organizations can also shape their service delivery practices to 
</p>
<p>respond to the direct lived experiences of the families they serve. For instance, an 
</p>
<p>organization serving Black populations in the Midwest works with families to 
</p>
<p>address issues of domestic violence and anger/aggression, through a program that 
</p>
<p>addresses his torical trauma in African American populations and positive empha-
</p>
<p>sis on &ldquo;Black Identity and the Black Experience&rdquo; (Callejas, Hernandez, Nesman, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Mowery, 2010).

</p>
<p> Cultural and&nbsp;Linguistic Characteristics of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Community&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Populations
</p>
<p>Before behavioral health organizations can implement culturally competent service 
</p>
<p>delivery, they need to have information about the populations (and the conditions in 
</p>
<p>which they live) within the neighborhood(s) that they serve. Understanding the 
</p>
<p>population(s) that we serve includes awareness of the influences of culture, ethnic-
</p>
<p>ity, race, socioeconomic status, and related social factors on the provision of ser-
</p>
<p>vices and help-seeking. As Staudt (2003) points out, it is important to link 
</p>
<p>interventions to the factors that contribute to a lack of engagement that we find 
</p>
<p>within our service use population and to recognize that these factors will vary across 
</p>
<p>groups and service types. Development of compatible service delivery strategies 
</p>
<p>that are compatible with the populations that we serve will not be possible without 
</p>
<p>this information.
</p>
<p>Understanding culture includes identifying shared social norms, beliefs, and val-
</p>
<p>ues, as well as languages of preference, and how institutions, such as marriage, 
</p>
<p>family, or education, are viewed and practiced (Guerra &amp; Jagers, 1998). Behavioral 
</p>
<p>health practitioners should expect variability within a culture rather than consider-
</p>
<p>ing certain characteristics to be consistent across all potential members. As noted 
</p>
<p>earlier, consideration should also be given to how culture develops in response to 
</p>
<p>specific contextual demands (Cauce et&nbsp;al., 2002) and the changes that may occur as 
</p>
<p>the social environments change (Bernal &amp; S&aacute;ez-Santiago, 2006). Our perspective 
</p>
<p>on culture provides a way to work with populations despite situations where fami-
</p>
<p>lies and/or individuals maintain widely varying beliefs or attitudes about specific 
</p>
<p>aspects of their identity (Dressler, 1993). Although we believe that culture impacts 
</p>
<p>how families and providers think about seeking/providing help, defining/diagnosing 
</p>
<p>problems, or understanding/treating mental health conditions, the way that culture 
</p>
<p>impacts these perspectives may vary. Therefore, the way that we characterize the 
</p>
<p>populations with which we work should be considered carefully (Akutsu, Snowden, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Organista, 1996; Alvidrez, 1999; Cauce et&nbsp;al., 2002).
</p>
<p>Understanding how identity shapes the ways in which diverse populations inter-
</p>
<p>act with service systems can contribute to the development of more compatible ser-
</p>
<p>vice systems. For instance, although biological foundations or genetic roots for 
</p>
<p>commonly accepted racial categories have been discounted (Bonham, Warshauer-
</p>
<p>Baker, &amp; Collins, 2005), race continues to shape provider decision-making pro-
</p>
<p>cesses that result in disparities (Aronson, Burgess, Phelan, &amp; Juarez, 2013). For 
</p>
<p>example, health disparities have been linked to decreased willingness of doctors to 
</p>
<p>interact with racially and ethnically diverse clients, different interpretations of symp-
</p>
<p>toms, and stereotypes about health-related behaviors (Aronson et&nbsp;al., 2013; Institute 
</p>
<p>of Medicine, 2002). Better understanding of the underlying causes of disparities 
</p>
<p>linked to race can point to important organizational adaptations, such as whether to 
</p>
<p>focus on information-based policies (e.g., provider and patient education) or rule-
</p>
<p>based policies (e.g., requirements aimed at equity) (Aronson et&nbsp;al., 2013).

<p>328
</p>
<p>Level of acculturation, migration history, and displacement experiences are also 
</p>
<p>important for understanding how to serve diverse populations. Acculturation, or the 
</p>
<p>adaptation to a host culture, may result in varying relationships for both the host 
</p>
<p>society and immigrant or displaced populations (Gamst et&nbsp;al., 2002). Knowledge 
</p>
<p>about the socioeconomic status (SES) of the populations that we serve is another 
</p>
<p>important factor for practitioners to acknowledge. In the United States, the overlap 
</p>
<p>between SES and culture/race/ethnicity can be significant (LaVeist, 2005). 
</p>
<p>Socioeconomic status has been specifically tied to barriers such as lack of insur-
</p>
<p>ance, time, and transportation that impact utilization of mental health services 
</p>
<p>(Alvidrez, 1999).
</p>
<p> Organizational Implementation Domains
</p>
<p>The conceptual model of organizational cultural competence also highlights two 
</p>
<p>organizational domains that play a central role in the delivery of culturally compe-
</p>
<p>tent services within a given community. Fig.&nbsp;2 illustrates the importance of ensuring 
</p>
<p>compatibility of functions and strategies within a given behavioral health organiza-
</p>

</p>
<p>delivery and a given population within the community it serves.

</p>
<p> Organizational Infrastructure
</p>
<p>The first domain, organizational infrastructure, includes eight interrelated compo-
</p>
<p>nents that are typical of organizations, each of which must be adapted to achieve 
</p>
<p>culturally competent service delivery. For example, organizational values, policies, 
</p>
<p>procedures, and governance can be adapted to address a given population&rsquo;s unique 
</p>
<p>characteristics or to address identified community issues, such as uneven rates of 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage or immigration laws that might affect the ways in which service 
</p>
<p>users interact with behavioral health organizations and service systems. 
</p>
<p>Communication that supports cultural competence includes inclusive communica-
</p>
<p>tion and learning within the organization, as well as between a given organization 
</p>
<p>and the community it serves. Human resources and service array domains include 
</p>
<p>strategies to increase bilingual/bicultural capacity, recruitment, and retention and 
</p>
<p>availability of services that are appropriate and of high quality for the target popula-
</p>
<p>tion. Methods of outreach to communities and opportunities for community/con-
</p>
<p>sumer participation are important mechanisms that can lead to increased use of 
</p>
<p>needed services by building trust between behavioral health organizations and the 
</p>
<p>diverse populations that they serve. Likewise, planning and evaluation processes 
</p>
<p>contribute to cultural competence when they include communities of color as fully 
</p>
<p>contributing partners with shared responsibilities and when they collect data that 
</p>
<p>reflects the diversity of the community (see SenGupta, Hopson, &amp; Thompson- 
</p>
<p>Robinson, 2004).
</p>
<p>Organizational leadership can also promote cultural competence by working to 
</p>
<p>increase an organization&rsquo;s technological resources, perhaps by adopting a more effi-
</p>
<p>cient database, for instance, or by securing diverse forms of funding. Organizational 
</p>
<p>leadership may also work to advocate for changes in funding mechanisms by lever-
</p>
<p>aging existing relationships with key policymakers and/or funding agencies 
</p>
<p>(Callejas et&nbsp;al., 2010). Implementation of strategies within an organization&rsquo;s infra-
</p>
<p>structure can influence the ways in which it interacts with the diverse populations it 
</p>
<p>serves and as the conceptual model illustrates.
</p>
<p> Direct Service Functions
</p>
<p>The direct service domain of an organization includes functions related to the avail-
</p>
<p>ability, availability, and utilization of behavioral health services, which are concep-
</p>
<p>tualized as three interrelated functions. Behavioral health organizations seeking to 
</p>
<p>provide culturally competent service delivery can implement a number of strategies 
</p>
<p>or direct service practices designed to increase service use by diverse populations. 
</p>
<p>Availability is defined as having services and supports in sufficient range and capac-
</p>
<p>ity to meet the needs of the diverse populations served by a given behavioral health 
</p>
<p>organization (or system). Direct service strategies designed to enhance or increase 
</p>
<p>the availability of behavioral health services may include the implementation of 
</p>
<p>Reframing the&nbsp;Concept of&nbsp;Cultural Competence to&nbsp;Enhance Delivery of&nbsp;Behavioral&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>330
</p>
<p>ethnic specific services and/or the use of mental health interpreters or cultural bro-
</p>
<p>kers. Culturally competent service accessibility encompasses the mechanisms 
</p>
<p>established by organizations that support individuals&rsquo; entry, navigation, and exit of 
</p>
<p>needed services and supports. Behavioral health organizations may choose to imple-
</p>
<p>ment a number of strategies designed to increase accessibility to services, including 
</p>
<p>providing services at times that accommodate the schedules of service users (e.g., 
</p>
<p>evenings and weekends); providing transportation support or home visiting ser-
</p>
<p>vices; and/or increasing contacts with service users to maintain levels of engage-
</p>
<p>ment and retention in services. Utilization is defined as the rate of use of services or 
</p>
<p>the degree of usability for populations served. To increase utilization of services 
</p>
<p>behavioral health organizations may promote the use of available services within 
</p>
<p>the community that they serve, as well as track service use patterns to more accu-
</p>
<p>rately understand service use patterns.
</p>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates how behavioral health service delivery can be enhanced 
</p>
<p>through the development of culturally responsive practices at both the organiza-
</p>
<p>tional and direct service levels. Access is shown as influencing and being influenced 
</p>
<p>by availability and utilization of services (shown as two-way arrows) indicating that 
</p>
<p>compatibility with the population involves adaptations in all three service domains, 
</p>
<p>which are understood as encompassing the continuum of service delivery from pre-
</p>
<p>vention to problem identification and help-seeking and to assessment, treatment, 
</p>
<p>and follow-up.
</p>
<p> Organizational Compatibility
</p>
<p>As noted throughout this section, the conceptual model presented in this chapter 
</p>
<p>emphasizes compatibility&mdash; between the organizational infrastructure and direct 
</p>
<p>service, as well as between each of the direct service functions within that particular 
</p>
<p>domain. Dynamic relationships (represented by two-way arrows) within the model 
</p>
<p>emphasize that organizational components do not operate in isolation. That is, 
</p>
<p>implementation of a direct service strategy designed to increase access to services 
</p>
<p>for a particular population should be supported at the organizational level through 
</p>
<p>specific governance procedures, creative and flexible funding of services, and other 
</p>
<p>strategies that will support direct service personnel in their efforts. Further as this 
</p>
<p>model seeks to make clear, compatibility between the organizational infrastructure 
</p>
<p>and direct service domains supports, at a much broader level, supports compatibility 
</p>
<p>between a behavioral health organization (or service system) and the target 
</p>
<p>population(s) within a given community.
</p>
<p>Research conducted with 12 behavioral health organizations around the country 
</p>
<p>identified and documented a number of strategies used to increase service availabil-
</p>
<p>ity, accessibility, and utilization as a means for reducing disparities in behavioral 
</p>
<p>health outcomes among ethnically and racially diverse populations and provided 
</p>

<p>331
</p>
<p>support for the importance of ensuring compatibility between organizational 
</p>
<p>domains when developing and implementing culturally competent behavioral health 
</p>
<p>services (Callejas et&nbsp;al., 2010). For instance, co-location of behavioral health ser-
</p>
<p>vices within a one-stop family services center may be used to increase accessibility 
</p>
<p>to needed services and to reduce stigma associated with mental illness. However, a 
</p>
<p>hypothetical lack of bilingual services available at the one-stop center engenders a 
</p>
<p>lack of trust in the organization among local residents, who are limited English 
</p>
<p>speakers and make up the majority of the residents in the immediate neighborhood 
</p>
<p>where the center is located. The lack of trust on the part of residents and the center&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>limited bilingual capacity then results in low levels of service utilization and little 
</p>
<p>improvement in mental health outcomes. Although hypothetical, this example high-
</p>
<p>lights the dynamic relationship between organizational components. Changes in 
</p>
<p>one area can affect service delivery processes, or lack of change in one area may 
</p>
<p>cancel out efforts in other areas. Incorporating cultural competence into every 
</p>
<p>aspect of a behavioral health organization or system requires careful consideration 
</p>
<p>of compatibility between important organizational components.
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Implementing Culturally Competent 
</p>
<p>Behavioral Health Services
</p>
<p>The conceptual model presented in this chapter provides a framework for operation-
</p>
<p>alizing cultural competence as a means for reducing behavioral health disparities in 
</p>
<p>diverse populations. This model expands previous theorizing on cultural compe-
</p>
<p>tence which has often focused on the interpersonal relationship between a practitio-
</p>
<p>ner and a consumer or on efforts to culturally adapt interventions to encompass the 
</p>
<p>role of organizations and systems in the service delivery process (Hernandez et&nbsp;al., 
</p>
<p>2009). Rather than focusing on memorizing the particular cultural values associated 
</p>
<p>with a given population and working to accommodate them, our model emphasizes 
</p>
<p>an organizational response to the contextual conditions of local communities, as 
</p>
<p>well as the culturally influenced factors that may enable or constrain accessibility to 
</p>
<p>needed services and supports on the part of diverse populations. Perhaps more 
</p>
<p>importantly, this model presents cultural competence as an approach that can be 
</p>
<p>implemented by all behavioral health organizations, not only those organizations 
</p>
<p>focused on serving racial or ethnic minority groups. As such, it frames cultural 
</p>
<p>competence as an active process to be undertaken by organizations in response to 
</p>
<p>changing community conditions. Moreover, it provides an overview of the infra-
</p>
<p>structure elements that behavioral health organizations should address if they are to 
</p>
<p>sustain cultural competence over time.
</p>
<p>The continued attention to stark disparities in behavioral healthcare outcomes 
</p>
<p>among diverse populations has led behavioral health and other practitioners to call 
</p>
<p>for increase guidance on specific strategies that can be implemented to provide 
</p>
<p>Reframing the&nbsp;Concept of&nbsp;Cultural Competence to&nbsp;Enhance Delivery of&nbsp;Behavioral&hellip;</p>

</p>
<p>more culturally responsive services. In addition to the research referenced through-
</p>
<p>out this chapter, readers are encouraged to review the National Standards for 
</p>
<p>Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) in healthcare to estab-
</p>
<p>lish concrete strategies that address the cultural and linguistic needs of the popula-
</p>
<p>tions that they serve (Betancourt, Green, Carrillo, &amp; Park, 2005). Although a number 
</p>
<p>of researchers have begun to examine whether implementation of such strategies 
</p>
<p>leads to reduced disparities in behavioral health and general healthcare, more 
</p>
<p>research is needed (see Betancourt et&nbsp;al., 2005; Bhui et&nbsp;al., 2007).
</p>
<p>Discussion related to culturally competent service delivery has also engaged the 
</p>
<p>question of culturally relevant interventions for diverse populations. The conceptual 
</p>
<p>model presented in this chapter is similar to one proposed by Bernal and S&aacute;ez- 
</p>
<p>Santiago (2006), which emphasizes the need for &ldquo;cultural congruence&rdquo; between 
</p>
<p>client and therapist but is aimed solely at the treatment level. Dimensions of congru-
</p>
<p>ence in this case include language use, relationship between client and provider, use 
</p>
<p>of metaphors (concepts and symbols) in therapy, cultural knowledge about the cli-
</p>
<p>ent, problem and treatment conceptualization, development of goals/methods/pro-
</p>
<p>cedures for treatment, and awareness of the client&rsquo;s broader social/economic/
</p>
<p>political context (Bernal &amp; S&aacute;ez-Santiago, 2006).
</p>
<p>The question of cultural adaptation of interventions has generated some degree 
</p>
<p>of controversy, especially between researchers that have called for a wider use of 
</p>
<p>empirically supported treatments (ESTs) to reduce behavioral health disparities and 
</p>
<p>those that have called for increased testing of interventions with racially and ethni-
</p>
<p>cally diverse populations, in particular (Bernal &amp; Domenech-Rodriguez, 2012). 
</p>
<p>Despite such contention, a number of studies have shown that culturally adapted 
</p>
<p>treatments produce positive outcomes (Bernal &amp; Domenech-Rodriguez, 2012; Huey 
</p>
<p>&amp; Polo, 2010). In addition, a number of practitioners and researchers have called for 
</p>
<p>increased recognition of practice-based evidence and community-defined evidence 
</p>
<p>as alternative paradigms that emphasize the &ldquo;cultural fit&rdquo; between interventions and 
</p>
<p>its recipients (Isaacs et&nbsp;al., 2008; Martinez, Callejas, &amp; Hernandez, 2010).
</p>
<p>The prominence that the cultural competence concept has attained within the 
</p>
<p>field of behavioral health continues to increase as researchers and practitioners seek 
</p>
<p>to better understand how to address persistent disparities in behavioral health out-
</p>
<p>comes among diverse populations. As the organizational cultural competence model 
</p>
<p>suggests, implementation of strategies in the interrelated infrastructure and direct 
</p>
<p>service domains of an organization can increase compatibility with diverse 
</p>
<p> populations in a given community. Despite research conducted with organizations 
</p>
<p>around the country to identify implementation of such strategies, additional research 
</p>
<p>is needed to test whether the implementation of culturally competent practice ulti-
</p>
<p>mately serves to reduce behavioral health disparities in the delivery of behavioral 
</p>
<p>health services. Nevertheless, the model provides direction for behavioral health 
</p>
<p>practitioners and researchers working to address the behavioral health needs of 
</p>
<p>underserved populations and communities.

<p>Pharmacy Services in&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Carol&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Ott
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Pharmacists have long been considered the most accessible healthcare profession-
</p>
<p>als, from the days of the independent community pharmacy with the lunch counter 
</p>
<p>and ice cream soda jerk to present day. Pharmacists traditionally have held a dis-
</p>
<p>tributive role, filling prescriptions that are written by physicians and presented to the 
</p>
<p>pharmacy counter, either in the community or hospital pharmacy. Until 2000, a 
</p>
<p>pharmacist may have held a Bachelor of Science Degree in Pharmacy; in that year, 
</p>
<p>the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree became the entry-level degree program for the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of pharmacy. While the general public often sees pharmacists in the distributive 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;prescription filling&rdquo; role, the profession of pharmacy has been pushing pharma-
</p>
<p>cists to take a broader role in patient care, including rounding with patient care 
</p>
<p>teams in the hospital setting to medication therapy management in community phar-
</p>
<p>macies. In the past decade, the role of the pharmacist in patient care had expanded 
</p>
<p>to providing medication-related services in outpatient and primary care clinics for a 
</p>
<p>variety of disease states. A newer important area of practice is in transitions of care, 
</p>
<p>with the pharmacist helping the patient move from the inpatient hospital to home 
</p>
<p>with a greater understanding of their medications and how to take them. Pharmacists 
</p>
<p>who practice in a more clinical role, whether in an inpatient or outpatient setting, are 
</p>
<p>often residency-trained and board-certified in their area of practice. Pharmacists 
</p>
<p>may specialize in the treatment of patients with mental disorders in the distributive 
</p>
<p>and clinical practice settings.

</p>
<p> Community Pharmacies
</p>
<p>As more Americans rely on prescriptions to manage their health issues, community 
</p>
<p>pharmacists often are one of the first health points of contact for families. Hence, it 
</p>
<p>is important to understand their role as key from a behavioral and public health 
</p>
<p>perspective.
</p>
<p> Health System Pharmacies
</p>
<p>In addition to traditional independent and chain retail community pharmacies, there 
</p>
<p>are pharmacies that are housed within outpatient clinics in health systems. These 
</p>
<p>pharmacies generally fill prescriptions for patients who have appointments with 
</p>
<p>providers within the health system or outpatient clinic and may also provide over- 
</p>
<p>the- counter medications. These pharmacies are convenient for the patient, and the 
</p>
<p>pharmacists and pharmacy technicians commonly have access to the patient medi-
</p>
<p>cal records for the health system. This access to the medical record allows the phar-
</p>
<p>macist to see health conditions, laboratory monitoring, drug allergies, and 
</p>
<p>prescription medications the patient is taking and is a more reliable way for the 
</p>
<p>pharmacist to provide patient-centered care than asking the patient for this informa-
</p>
<p>tion in a traditional community pharmacy. It also permits the pharmacist to have 
</p>
<p>easier access to the physician in case of questions about a prescription or need for 
</p>
<p>refills.
</p>
<p>Recent research has studied the role of the community pharmacy in providing 
</p>
<p>earlier detection of mental disorders, specifically depression (Rubio-Valera, Chen, 
</p>
<p>&amp; O&rsquo;Reilly, 2014). For the past few decades, pharmacists have been involved in 
</p>
<p>screening for high blood pressure and diabetes, but few have ventured into screen-
</p>
<p>ing for mental disorders. Stigma related to behavioral health conditions and discom-
</p>
<p>fort in talking to patients about these disorders may be a significant reason. Studies 
</p>
<p>of pharmacists and their comfort in providing medication counseling for various 
</p>
<p>disease states have shown that pharmacists in general feel more confident in coun-
</p>
<p>seling about high blood pressure or diabetes medications than about behavioral dis-
</p>
<p>orders and medications (Phokeo, Sproule, &amp; Raman-Wilms, 2004).
</p>
<p>Improvement in didactic and experiential education in pharmacy school/college 
</p>
<p>programs as well as redesigning community pharmacies to offer truly private patient 
</p>
<p>counseling are areas of focus in the profession of pharmacy to impact these con-
</p>
<p>cerns (Calogero &amp; Caley, 2017). Pharmacists who have been trained in the use of 
</p>
<p>screening tools for depression feel more comfortable with patient interactions. They 
</p>
<p>are accessible due to the lack of need for appointments and the opportunity in the 
</p>
<p>community pharmacy to screen for depression, recognize patients who may be at- 
</p>
<p>risk, and make appropriate referrals (Rubio-Valera et&nbsp;al., 2014). These screenings 
</p>
<p>may be done in either traditional community pharmacies or in pharmacies within 
</p>

</p>
<p>health systems. As noted previously, pharmacists within health systems may have 
</p>
<p>greater access to medical records and physicians than other pharmacists.
</p>
<p> Pharmacies in&nbsp;Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs)
</p>
<p>CMHCs may have pharmacies that are located within the clinic setting. Health sys-
</p>
<p>tems may have a pharmacy in the outpatient clinic; some health systems also have 
</p>
<p>an affiliated CMHC that has a pharmacy. Independent and chain retail pharmacies 
</p>
<p>may partner with a CMHC to have a pharmacy located within the clinic. Pharmacy 
</p>
<p>companies may specialize in placing a community pharmacy in a CMHC.
</p>
<p>Genoa Healthcare is the most recognized of these pharmacy companies. In 2018, 
</p>
<p>Genoa Healthcare had 418 pharmacies located in a CMHC, recorded about 650,000 
</p>
<p>patient encounters in their pharmacies, and had more than 250 psychiatrists working 
</p>
<p>with their telepsychiatry services (www.genoahealthcare.com). Genoa Healthcare 
</p>
<p>pharmacies can provide specialized packaging of medication, refill reminders, and 
</p>
<p>medication delivery.
</p>
<p>While the pharmacy is located in a CMHC, medications for primary care and 
</p>
<p>other conditions are available in addition to behavioral health medications. A phar-
</p>
<p>macist is embedded in the outpatient treatment team to provide medication reviews 
</p>
<p>and adherence information. A retrospective study comparing traditional community 
</p>
<p>pharmacies and pharmacies integrated into CHMCs evaluated Medicaid claims and 
</p>
<p>medication adherence. The results of the study showed that patients who filled med-
</p>
<p>ications in a CMHC integrated pharmacy had higher medication adherence, 
</p>
<p>decreased rates of hospitalization, and decreased emergency department use, result-
</p>
<p>ing in improved care and a decrease in the use and cost of acute care services 
</p>
<p>(Wright, Gorman, Odorzynski, Peterson, &amp; Clayton, 2016).
</p>
<p> Insurance Coverage
</p>
<p>The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA) required that large group health 
</p>
<p>plans provide mental health (MH) benefits that are equal to medical benefits in 
</p>
<p>annual and lifetime benefits. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health 
</p>
<p>Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) clarified the MHPA to include 
</p>
<p>substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and smaller health plans and group insur-
</p>
<p>ance coverage (The Center for Consumer Information &amp; Insurance Oversight, 
</p>
<p>2018). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) added these benefits to individual health 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage. The MHPAEA did not require health insurers to cover MH/
</p>
<p>SUD treatment; the parity law requirement applies to those plans that choose to 
</p>
<p>provide these benefits. The ACA built upon the MHPAEA in requiring MH/SUD 
</p>
<p>coverage as one of the ten essential health benefits.

</p>
<p> Commercial Insurance
</p>
<p>Commercial insurance may come from employers or from the individual private 
</p>
<p>insurance marketplace created by the ACA.&nbsp;Commercial insurance may be more 
</p>
<p>likely than Medicaid and Medicare programs to be subject to more restrictive pre-
</p>
<p>ferred drug lists, formularies, and prior authorizations for medications (covered in a 
</p>
<p>later section). The Healthcare Marketplace is set up for individuals to obtain health-
</p>
<p>care insurance that fits their needs and they can afford. Challenges exist for indi-
</p>
<p>viduals in determining if their current healthcare provider is covered under a plan 
</p>
<p>they may choose, which has resulted in patients not being able to keep their current 
</p>
<p>provider or have the same medication coverage they may have had with previous 
</p>
<p>insurance plans (www.cms.gov).
</p>
<p> Medicare and&nbsp;Medicaid
</p>
<p>President Lyndon B.&nbsp;Johnson signed the Social Security Act Amendments that cre-
</p>
<p>ated Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The Medicare program is designed to provide 
</p>
<p>insurance coverage and healthcare treatment for people who are over the age of 65, 
</p>
<p>are disabled, or have end-stage renal disease. In 2003, the Medicare Part D 
</p>
<p>Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act added Medicare Part D, 
</p>
<p>which provides prescription drug insurance coverage for Medicare recipients.
</p>
<p>Medicaid is a healthcare coverage program for people who are low-income, 
</p>
<p>pregnant women, people with disabilities, and those who need long-term care ser-
</p>
<p>vices. The federal government provides funding to the states to administer Medicaid 
</p>
<p>programs based upon the state decisions. In addition to providing for the Health 
</p>
<p>Insurance Marketplace, the ACA 2010 allowed states to choose to expand their 
</p>
<p>Medicaid programs to cover more people by raising the maximum low-income stan-
</p>
<p>dard to a higher wage (www.cms.gov).
</p>
<p> Preferred Drug Lists
</p>
<p>Preferred drug lists (PDLs) are employed by insurance programs to steer prescribers 
</p>
<p>and patients toward lower-cost medications, including generic drugs. Insurance pro-
</p>
<p>viders are often able to negotiate with drug manufacturers to obtain a lower price for 
</p>
<p>their programs if a specific drug made by a manufacturer is considered to be pre-
</p>
<p>ferred, even if it is not a generic. These are called &ldquo;supplemental rebate programs&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>Commercial insurance programs, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>Administration each utilize this type of rebate program to lower costs. PDLs also 
</p>
<p>decrease the cost of treatment per member of each insurance program. Managed 
</p>
<p>care insurance programs, often utilized by state Medicaid insurers, are commonly 
</p>

</p>
<p>paid a set rate per member per month. This leads managed care and pharmacy ben-
</p>
<p>efits managers to search for the lowest-cost medication or treatment for a disease 
</p>
<p>state. Co-payments for medication that are paid by the patient at the pharmacy can 
</p>
<p>also impact the cost to the insurer. Co-payments are either a set amount per prescrip-
</p>
<p>tion or a percentage of the cost of the prescription. Medications that are considered 
</p>
<p>to be first-tier on PDLs have co-payments that are lower in percentage or set price 
</p>
<p>than medications that are second- or third-tier.
</p>
<p>A literature review by Ovsag, Hydery, and Mousa (2008) evaluated the impact of 
</p>
<p>PDLs in Medicaid on cost and quality of care. Problems with PDLs identified by 
</p>
<p>this review include the influence of PDLs on the use of other healthcare services, 
</p>
<p>potentially increasing overall cost, and the concern that restricting access to medica-
</p>
<p>tion can lead to a decreased quality of care for a patient. A retrospective cohort study 
</p>
<p>evaluated the impact of a new PDL on adherence to medication for Medicaid 
</p>
<p>patients in Alabama, specifically focused on medications used for heart disease and 
</p>
<p>elevated cholesterol. The results of the study identified an 82% increased odds of 
</p>
<p>Medicaid patients becoming non-adherent to statin medications used to treat ele-
</p>
<p>vated cholesterol after the implementation of the new PDL (Ridley &amp; Axelsen, 
</p>
<p>2006).
</p>
<p>Another study focused on changes to Medicaid evaluated how a decrease in 
</p>
<p>days&rsquo; supply per prescription and an increase in co-payment affected adherence to 
</p>
<p>cholesterol and hypertension medication. For those Medicaid patients who took 
</p>
<p>nearly all of their medications prior to the change, there was a significant decline in 
</p>
<p>adherence to these medication after the change (Amin, Farley, Maciejewski, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Domino, 2017). Overall, while PDLs are perceived by insurers to decrease short- 
</p>
<p>term cost, a growing body of evidence suggests that quality of life and healthcare 
</p>
<p>outcomes are negatively impacted by PDL programs.
</p>
<p> Patient Assistance/Co-Payment Assistance Programs
</p>
<p>Drug manufacturers will often make patient assistance programs (PAPs) that pro-
</p>
<p>vide either free or reduced cost medications available to patients who meet eligibil-
</p>
<p>ity criteria. Patients who do not have insurance, are not eligible for Medicaid or 
</p>
<p>other insurance programs, are low-income, or have insurance that does not cover 
</p>
<p>certain medications may benefit from enrolling in a PAP program. PAP programs 
</p>
<p>require an application, as well as proof of income, and occasionally citizenship, 
</p>
<p>which can limit their widespread use. Pharmacists are in a position to be aware of 
</p>
<p>PAPs and to aid patients in applying for them. Manufacturer websites generally 
</p>
<p>provide information about available PAPs for their medications, and there are 
</p>
<p>groups/websites that list more general PAP information. These groups/websites 
</p>
<p>include RxAssist (www.rxassist.org), NeedyMeds (https://www.needymeds.org/
</p>
<p>pap), Paying for Senior Care (www.payingforseniorcare.com), and a list of pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical manufacturers at www.cms.gov.

<p>One manufacturer, Janssen, provides a comprehensive assistance program known 
</p>
<p>as Janssen Connect&reg; for patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and prescribed a 
</p>
<p>long-acting injection (LAI) made by the company. A recent evaluation of the pro-
</p>
<p>gram noted that nearly 80% of patients enrolled did not miss receiving their injec-
</p>
<p>tion for more than 7&nbsp; weeks and 87% were fully adherent with an every-4-week 
</p>
<p>injection regimen (Benson, Joshi, Lapane, &amp; Fastenau, 2015). The cost of co-pay-
</p>
<p>ments can be a burden to patients, especially those who have co-payments based 
</p>
<p>upon a percentage of the drug cost and those who are receiving expensive brand-
</p>
<p>name medications.
</p>
<p>One study evaluated patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and the impact of 
</p>
<p>Medicaid prescription co-payments on their use of antipsychotics as well as other 
</p>
<p>medications for medical conditions. The study included fee-for-service Medicaid 
</p>
<p>patients in 42 states and the District of Columbia. The study results suggested that 
</p>
<p>as the co-payment cost increased, the number of medication refills decreased in a 
</p>
<p>small, but statistically significant, way for antipsychotics. For medications for medi-
</p>
<p>cal conditions, patients were 4&ndash;11 times less likely to fill prescriptions (Doshi, Li, 
</p>
<p>Desai, &amp; Marcus, 2017). Co-payments for prescriptions have risen significantly for 
</p>
<p>the past several years and have become a significant burden for patients. The use of 
</p>
<p>PAPs and co-pay assistance programs can help to decrease this burden and increase 
</p>
<p>medication adherence.
</p>
<p> Clinical Pharmacy Services
</p>
<p> The Clinical Pharmacist in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Inpatient Mental Health Setting
</p>
<p>For several decades, clinical pharmacists have been working in the inpatient treat-
</p>
<p>ment setting in mental health, rounding with prescribers, evaluating medication 
</p>
<p>regimens, providing medication groups, and making recommendations for treat-
</p>
<p>ment changes and monitoring needs. Clinical pharmacists may have collaborative 
</p>
<p>practice agreements (CPAs) with physicians in the inpatient setting to make medica-
</p>
<p>tion adjustments and order laboratory monitoring under protocols. Most psychiatric 
</p>
<p>clinical pharmacists have completed both a postgraduate year 1 residency in phar-
</p>
<p>macy practice and a postgraduate year 2 residency in psychiatric pharmacy. Board 
</p>
<p>Certification in Psychiatric Pharmacy (BCPP) is available through the Board of 
</p>
<p>Pharmacy Specialties, and this certification is held by most psychiatric clinical 
</p>
<p>pharmacists.
</p>
<p>In the past decade, research in this area has focused on improvement in medica-
</p>
<p>tion adherence and cost-savings realized by utilizing a clinical pharmacist in the 
</p>
<p>inpatient setting. An economic analysis reviewed clinical pharmacist interventions 
</p>
<p>to evaluate cost-savings from the addition of a clinical pharmacist. The study results 
</p>
<p>indicated that inpatient clinical pharmacists have a positive impact on hospital bud-
</p>
<p>gets, especially in the areas of prevention of adverse drug reactions, discontinuation 
</p>

</p>
<p>of unnecessary drugs, and a positive effect in high-cost environments, such as inten-
</p>
<p>sive care units (Dalton &amp; Byrne, 2017; Gallagher, McCarthy, &amp; Byrne, 2014). A 
</p>
<p>comprehensive review of clinical pharmacy services in mental health noted that 
</p>
<p>there is a significant potential for these services to improve clinical and quality of 
</p>
<p>life outcomes through review of medication charts and laboratory monitoring, eval-
</p>
<p>uation of physician prescribing, and the provision of education to patients and other 
</p>
<p>healthcare professionals (Richardson, O&rsquo;Reilly, &amp; Chen, 2014).
</p>
<p> Clinical Pharmacists in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Community Mental Health Setting
</p>
<p>More recently, psychiatric clinical pharmacists have taken roles as healthcare pro-
</p>
<p>viders in outpatient clinic treatment settings. These pharmacists have also generally 
</p>
<p>completed two postgraduate residency years and are BCPP certified. Outpatient 
</p>
<p>psychiatric clinical pharmacists have CPAs with physicians that can range from 
</p>
<p>focused medication management via protocol to independent medication manage-
</p>
<p>ment. Outpatient CPAs can be limited to seeing patients for medication regimen 
</p>
<p>reviews, adherence, prescription refills, laboratory monitoring, and side effect eval-
</p>
<p>uation. The outpatient clinical pharmacist CPA can also have a broad focus with 
</p>
<p>independent medication management, including the ability to do the tasks in the 
</p>
<p>limited CPA in addition to seeing patients for mental status assessments and addi-
</p>
<p>tion, discontinuation, and adjustment of medications.
</p>
<p>Outpatient psychiatric clinical pharmacists can also play a role in PAPs and co- 
</p>
<p>payment assistance programs. A recent Cochrane review of the effect of non- 
</p>
<p>dispensing roles for outpatient pharmacy concluded that the pharmacist role has 
</p>
<p>expanded and the evidence supports medication management, patient counseling, 
</p>
<p>patient education, and education outreach to physicians regarding prescribing prac-
</p>
<p>tices (Nkansah et&nbsp;al., 2010). A retrospective study that evaluated 10&nbsp;years of medi-
</p>
<p>cation therapy management in an integrated healthcare system reviewed the medical 
</p>
<p>records of more than 9000 patients for clinical pharmacist intervention. Cost-savings 
</p>
<p>to the health system over 10&nbsp;years from pharmacist intervention was approximately 
</p>
<p>$700,000 (Ramalho de Oliveira, Brummel, &amp; Miller, 2010).
</p>
<p> Transitions of&nbsp;Care
</p>
<p>Increased hospital readmissions within 30&nbsp; days has prompted health systems to 
</p>
<p>evaluate their discharge practice and implement policies and practices that improve 
</p>
<p>patient education about medications and treatment, improve follow-up treatment 
</p>
<p>interactions, and reduce readmission rates. Pharmacists play a role on teams for 
</p>
<p>transitions of care by providing discharge counseling on medications for clear 
</p>
<p>patient understanding, ensuring that there are no duplicate prescription orders at the 
</p>

</p>
<p>pharmacy, and evaluating insurance coverage and the patient&rsquo;s ability to pay for 
</p>
<p>medications in the outpatient pharmacy prior to discharge.
</p>
<p>Some health systems have piloted transitions of care teams that are run by phar-
</p>
<p>macists and include communication between the inpatient and outpatient clinical 
</p>
<p>pharmacists so that the outpatient treatment team is aware of the need for follow-up 
</p>
<p>for the patient. A prospective study of 98 patients who had physician-initiated out-
</p>
<p>patient follow-up with pharmacist intervention compared 236 patients who had out-
</p>
<p>patient follow-up without pharmacist intervention. The patients who received 
</p>
<p>pharmacist intervention had a hospital readmission rate within 30&nbsp; days of 9.2% 
</p>
<p>compared to a 19.4% 30-day readmission rate for those patients who did not have a 
</p>
<p>pharmacist intervention (Arnold, Buys, &amp; Fullas, 2015).
</p>
<p>Cavanaugh, Lindsey, Shilliday, and Ratner (2015) studied patient outcomes for a 
</p>
<p>pharmacist-coordinated multidisciplinary follow-up team that included a total of 
</p>
<p>140 patient visits. The 30-day readmission rate for the multidisciplinary team was 
</p>
<p>14.3% compared to 34.3% for patients who were followed up by the physician-only 
</p>
<p>team (Cavanaugh et&nbsp;al., 2015). The implementation of services that are coordinated 
</p>
<p>between inpatient and outpatient services can include an evaluation of the patient 
</p>
<p>medication regimen prior to admission, performance of medication reconciliation, 
</p>
<p>patient education on medications initiated during the hospitalization, and the initia-
</p>
<p>tion of affordable medication regimens that the patient would be counseled on and 
</p>
<p>receive prior to discharge (Gilmore et&nbsp;al., 2015).
</p>
<p> Medication Factors for&nbsp;Successful Treatment
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;adherence to treatment&rdquo; assumes the patient and the healthcare provider 
</p>
<p>have developed a plan for treatment and it is agreed upon by both parties. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compliance with treatment&rdquo; is a term often used interchangeably with adherence 
</p>
<p>to treatment but assumes that the provider had determined a plan and the patient will 
</p>
<p>follow it. Adherence implies a partnership and is a patient-centered approach, while 
</p>
<p>compliance is following a plan for which the patient did not have input. Healthcare 
</p>
<p>providers can use several tools to ensure that the patient understands and agrees to 
</p>
<p>the plan and that the plan includes decisions made by the patient.
</p>
<p> Motivational Interviewing (MI)
</p>
<p>MI is a tool that is collaborative, patient-centered, and relies on the provider to dis-
</p>
<p>cover what will lead to behavioral change based upon the needs of the individual 
</p>
<p>patient. MI uses the &ldquo;OARS&rdquo; approach to behavioral change: (1) open-ended ques-
</p>
<p>tions, (2) affirmations, (3) reflective listening, and (4) summaries. Pharmacists are 
</p>
<p>accessible healthcare professionals who are positioned to identify patient 
</p>
<p>C. A. Ott</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>345
</p>
<p>nonadherence and can use the techniques of MI in any patient care setting, including 
</p>
<p>the community pharmacy. Pharmacists who use MI can discuss the patient&rsquo;s under-
</p>
<p>standing of their disease and medications, determine how the treatment plan includes 
</p>
<p>patient goals, and engage the patient in communication about any resistance to the 
</p>
<p>plan (Salvo &amp; Cannon-Breland, 2015). In the past, pharmacists gave advice to 
</p>
<p>patients based upon specific questions asked with drug or dosing information. The 
</p>
<p>practice of MI is now taught in schools and colleges of pharmacy to enhance phar-
</p>
<p>macist communication and include patient-centered aspects of care.
</p>
<p>A study by Luetsch and Burrows (2018) evaluated 89 pharmacists and their 
</p>
<p>reflective journal entries after training and implementation of MI. The pharmacists 
</p>
<p>were asked to reflect on their perceptions of practice changes related to emotional 
</p>
<p>aspects of communication and success in difficult situations. Prior to the training 
</p>
<p>and implementation, none of the reflections indicated transformative changes in 
</p>
<p>their frame of reference toward patient-centered care. After the training, 38% of the 
</p>
<p>journal reflections were considered to be transformational, indicating that MI tech-
</p>
<p>niques can be learned and are successful in improving communication in the phar-
</p>
<p>macy setting (Luetsch &amp; Burrows, 2018).
</p>
<p> Shared Decision-Making (SDM)
</p>
<p>In addition to MI, SDM is a communication tool that empowers patients to be 
</p>
<p>active participants in treatment decisions. It is considered an important concept in 
</p>
<p>mental health and a recovery-oriented system of care. SDM considers both the 
</p>
<p>healthcare provider and the patient to be &ldquo;experts&rdquo; in the care of the patient. Each 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;expert&rdquo; must share information, assess the advantages and disadvantages of a 
</p>
<p>proposed treatment, and use collaboration to choose the intervention. In a study 
</p>
<p>that evaluated 22 adults with mental health disorders, semi-structured focus 
</p>
<p>groups evaluated how these patients perceived SDM (Grim, Rosenberg, Svedberg, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Schon, 2016). The focus group participants appreciated being included in dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of their choices for treatment, the specifics of options, and the ability to be 
</p>
<p>included in the decisions, especially related to their personal needs. The area for 
</p>
<p>improvement noted by the participants was feeling prepared for this type of com-
</p>
<p>munication. Most participants did not feel prepared and felt that their choices 
</p>
<p>were not trusted by the healthcare provider because they were not informed (Grim 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>Psychiatric medication management is a specific area where SDM is useful. 
</p>
<p>Mental health medications are a mainstay of treatment but often have significant 
</p>
<p>adverse effects and less effectiveness than is hoped for by patients. Treatment with 
</p>
<p>medications may be coerced, and patients may feel that they are being pressured to 
</p>
<p>take medications in general or to agree to LAIs if they are not adherent to oral medi-
</p>
<p>cations. SDM in the context of medication use may be subject to loss of true col-
</p>
<p>laboration if the healthcare provider feels that the patient does not have insight or is 
</p>
<p>Pharmacy Services in&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>346
</p>
<p>not able to make fully informed treatment decisions. This may lead to the patient 
</p>
<p>feeling a lack of respect for their input and not initiating treatment or discontinuing 
</p>
<p>a medication. SDM related to psychiatric medication use should include a  discussion 
</p>
<p>of all possible adverse effects, the risk versus benefit of taking the medication, an 
</p>
<p>allowance for the patient to &ldquo;test&rdquo; a treatment regimen by adjusting doses to times 
</p>
<p>that fit their schedule, and clear information about the risks of not taking medication 
</p>
<p>(Morant, Kaminskiy, &amp; Ramon, 2016).
</p>
<p>While the technique of MI is a part of the curriculum in schools and colleges of 
</p>
<p>pharmacy, the concept of SDM is not common. Younas, Bradley, Holmes, Sud, and 
</p>
<p>Maidment (2016) studied the perception of SDM by mental health pharmacists in 
</p>
<p>the United Kingdom, where national guidelines encourage the use of SDM in anti-
</p>
<p>psychotic prescribing. Semi-structured interviews were performed with 13 mental 
</p>
<p>health pharmacists who were currently in psychiatric practice settings. The results 
</p>
<p>of the study suggest that the pharmacists considered SDM regarding antipsychotic 
</p>
<p>medications to improve clinical outcomes and relationships with patients; barriers 
</p>
<p>to implementation of more widespread SDM included a lack of training, staff time 
</p>
<p>constraints, and the ability of the patient to participate in SDM (Younas et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p> Long-Acting Injectable (LAI) Antipsychotic Medication
</p>
<p>LAI antipsychotic medications are depot intramuscular injections that last from 
</p>
<p>2&nbsp;weeks to 12&nbsp;weeks depending on the medication and the formulation. Guidelines 
</p>
<p>for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder state that oral formulations 
</p>
<p>should be tried first but that LAI antipsychotic formulations may be considered 
</p>
<p>either after failure of oral medication or if the patient would benefit and agree to the 
</p>
<p>LAI for convenience. The history of LAI antipsychotic use has often included coer-
</p>
<p>cion or pressure on the patient to agree to a LAI after not being adherent to oral 
</p>
<p>medications, which has led to a lack of trust in healthcare providers who suggest 
</p>
<p>these medications. More recently, healthcare providers have introduced the idea of 
</p>
<p>LAI antipsychotics earlier in a course of treatment as a convenience to the patient, 
</p>
<p>resulting in an increased use of LAI antipsychotics.
</p>
<p>There is clinical evidence that LAI antipsychotics do improve adherence to med-
</p>
<p>ication and decrease the rate of hospitalization during a symptom relapse. A study 
</p>
<p>by Marcus, Zummo, Pettit, Stoddard, and Doshi (2015) compared oral and LAI 
</p>
<p>antipsychotic adherence and outcomes after release from a psychiatric hospitaliza-
</p>
<p>tion. Adherence to medication was better in the LAI group (adherence&nbsp;=&nbsp;48.2%) 
</p>
<p>versus the oral group (adherence&nbsp;=&nbsp;32.3%). LAI participants also were less likely to 
</p>
<p>be rehospitalized for relapse (19.1% vs. 25.3%) (Marcus et&nbsp;al., 2015). Research is 
</p>
<p>lacking that compares the use of communication techniques such as MI and SDM 
</p>
<p>with rates of adherence with oral or LAI antipsychotics.

<p> Barriers to&nbsp;Treatment
</p>
<p> Dual Diagnosis Treatment
</p>
<p>Dual diagnosis in the context of mental health care includes the evaluation and treat-
</p>
<p>ment of both mental and substance use disorders in the same clinic setting. 
</p>
<p>Historically, treatment for these disorders has been differentiated into separate clini-
</p>
<p>cal settings as if they are unrelated to each other or that one condition cannot be 
</p>
<p>successfully treated without first addressing the other disease state. Despite evi-
</p>
<p>dence and awareness that integrated services for dual diagnosis are beneficial for the 
</p>
<p>patient, there are a significant lack of healthcare providers who have taken this 
</p>
<p>approach. A 2012 study assessed the availability of dual diagnosis capability in the 
</p>
<p>United States using a sample of 256 programs. Only about 18% of the addiction 
</p>
<p>treatment services and 9% of mental health programs met the criteria for dual diag-
</p>
<p>nosis treatment services (McGovern, Lambert-Harris, Gotham, Claus, &amp; Xie, 2014).
</p>
<p>Dual diagnosis is very common; one study noted that people with drug depen-
</p>
<p>dence presented with a mental health disorder 4.9 times more frequently than indi-
</p>
<p>viduals without an addiction diagnosis (Di Lorenzo, Galliani, Guicciardi, Landi, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Ferri, 2014). A retrospective analysis of demographic and other factors related to 
</p>
<p>dual diagnosis found that the participants in this study more often suffered from a 
</p>
<p>personality disorder, had a family history of mental health or substance use disor-
</p>
<p>ders, and had suffered trauma (Di Lorenzo et&nbsp;al., 2014). Dual diagnosis patients 
</p>
<p>may have more chronic, disabling, and severe disease, requiring longer and more 
</p>
<p>intensive treatment. Mental health and addiction programs often have different 
</p>
<p>structures, assessment procedures, continuity of care, and treatment plans that may 
</p>
<p>not meet the needs of dual diagnosis patients; collaboration of care between mental 
</p>
<p>health and addiction providers is challenged by treatment access and coordination 
</p>
<p>of care (Padwa, Guerrero, Braslow, &amp; Fenwick, 2015). Pharmacists may bridge the 
</p>
<p>gap in treatment by providing coordination of care related to medication use and 
</p>
<p>access to treatment.
</p>
<p> Lack of&nbsp;Mental Health Providers
</p>
<p>A significant concern for adequate mental health services is the lack of providers in 
</p>
<p>rural and underserved patient populations. Starting in 2009, states enacted signifi-
</p>
<p>cant budget cuts to CMHCs, who are often the only provider of mental health ser-
</p>
<p>vices in rural areas. In addition, the MHPAEA of 2008 and the ACA 2010 required 
</p>
<p>mental healthcare reform and parity that increased the number of persons able to 
</p>
<p>afford treatment services. This increase in insured patients seeking services further 
</p>
<p>stressed a mental health system with decreasing budgets (Larrison et&nbsp;al., 2011). In a 
</p>
<p>Pharmacy Services in&nbsp;Behavioral Health</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>348
</p>
<p>study evaluating racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care, the results 
</p>
<p>showed a significant difference in access to care for Black and Latino patients rela-
</p>
<p>tive to White patients. Minorities lived in counties with greater poverty and unem-
</p>
<p>ployment rates compared to Whites. The availability of insurance, CMHC treatment, 
</p>
<p>and density of specialty providers benefited Black individuals. Increased racial and 
</p>
<p>ethnic residential segregation is associated with shortages of psychiatrists for Latino 
</p>
<p>patients (L&ecirc; Cook, Doksum, Chen, Carle, &amp; Alegria, 2013).
</p>
<p>Community pharmacies are present in nearly every community, providing an 
</p>
<p>opportunity for community pharmacists to bridge the gap in access to mental health 
</p>
<p>services. Barriers to the provision of this service exist, including heavy dispensing 
</p>
<p>workloads, negative attitudes about individuals experiencing mental health disor-
</p>
<p>ders, and stigma (Calogero &amp; Caley, 2017). Clinical pharmacists in outpatient men-
</p>
<p>tal health treatment settings can provide medication regimen review; interview 
</p>
<p>patients about medication adherence, side effects, and effectiveness; and work 
</p>
<p>under collaborative practice agreements to provide mental health medication man-
</p>
<p>agement services to increase the time available to both primary care and mental 
</p>
<p>health providers for mental health treatment (Rubio-Valera et&nbsp;al., 2014).
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Clinical psychiatric pharmacists have been practicing in the area of mental health 
</p>
<p>for many years and are vital members of the treatment team. While inpatient clinical 
</p>
<p>psychiatric pharmacists have been found in this practice area for some time, outpa-
</p>
<p>tient clinical psychiatric pharmacists have, for the past decade, begun to create roles 
</p>
<p>within the clinic setting. Inpatient psychiatric pharmacists perform tasks related to 
</p>
<p>medication regimen review, patient rounds, and transitions of care; outpatient psy-
</p>
<p>chiatric pharmacists provide medication management, adherence and side effect 
</p>
<p>reviews, decreased medication overlap, and application for patient assistance pro-
</p>
<p>grams under collaborative practice agreements with physicians. Because of a lack 
</p>
<p>of mental health providers and decreased funding for CMHCs in rural areas, clinical 
</p>
<p>pharmacists are filling the role of mental health provider in outpatient primary care 
</p>
<p>settings.
</p>
<p>Community pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare professionals and 
</p>
<p>can provide evaluation of medication adherence, patient counseling, insurance 
</p>
<p>assessments, and mental health screenings with referral to mental health providers. 
</p>
<p>Education in schools and colleges of pharmacy has focused on decreasing pharma-
</p>
<p>cist stigma and negative images of people with mental disorders and increasing the 
</p>
<p>comfort level of the pharmacist for interacting with patients through the use of moti-
</p>
<p>vational interviewing and shared decision-making. Pharmacists are uniquely posi-
</p>
<p>tioned to fill the gap in available mental health providers, both in the community 
</p>
<p>pharmacy and clinical practice setting.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Public policymaking begins with an official acknowledgment of an identified issue 
</p>
<p>or concern (Hanson, 2014). This begins a series of practical actions to resolve the 
</p>
<p>issue; an issue is identified and a multilayered process begins to seek a solution that 
</p>
<p>attempts to address problems at an individual (micro)level as well as at the meso- 
</p>
<p>and macro-levels. The policymaking process includes the selection of a &ldquo;working 
</p>
<p>group&rdquo; (i.e., an individual, a group of individuals, or an institution to examine the 
</p>
<p>problem and to generate recommendations). To do so, the working group requests 
</p>
<p>one or more policy analyses, depending upon the complexity of the problem and the 
</p>
<p>scope of its mandate.
</p>
<p>These policy analyses review the identified problems from numerous perspec-
</p>
<p>tives, including economic, political, or social, to define and describe the problem and 
</p>
<p>recommend possible solutions. Social, statistical, and epidemiologic data regarding 
</p>
<p>behavioral health are gathered, as is the evidence on best practices. After the recom-
</p>
<p>mendations, an external agency or the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of a 
</p>
<p>state or federal government then takes over to initiate the designated actions. This 
</p>
<p>process, or variants of the process, occurs daily across the world as we seek to find 
</p>
<p>best solutions to address behavioral disorders, improve quality of life and outcomes 
</p>
<p>for persons with these disorders, and to improve population health (Hanson, 2014).

</p>
<p>In this chapter, we attempt to integrate current trends in global behavioral health 
</p>
<p>policy, systems, and services, examining the magnitude of the problem, from 
</p>
<p> definitional and operational perspectives, with a focus on child and adolescent 
</p>
<p>behavioral health. This includes a look at the ambiguity of behavioral health 
</p>
<p> policymaking, as a policy problem, from numerous frames, perspectives, popula-
</p>
<p>tions, and  disciplines to the difficulties in integrating global and national priorities 
</p>
<p>across disparate cultures, economies, and infrastructures.
</p>
<p> Framing the&nbsp;Magnitude of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Public Policy Problem
</p>
<p>Defining significant problems as policy actions in behavioral health are not only 
</p>
<p>harder to define but also more open to dispute as to what constitutes a problem and 
</p>
<p>what is the most effective solution to the problem. Public policy problems often are 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;wicked problems&rdquo; (Rittel &amp; Martin, 1973). Such problems are dependent upon 
</p>
<p>how an issue is framed, the language used by stakeholders, and time and resource 
</p>
<p>constraints, but more importantly, there is seldom a definitive solution. Such signifi-
</p>
<p>cant problems essentially are unique and do not have an exhaustively describable set 
</p>
<p>of potential solutions.
</p>
<p>Almost anything of an economic, social, or political nature can influence policy, 
</p>
<p>particularly behavioral health policy. In almost any policy analysis in behavioral health, 
</p>
<p>there are overlapping issues, including financing; organization of services; promotion, 
</p>
<p>prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation; intersectoral collaboration; advocacy; legis-
</p>
<p>lation and human rights; workforce development; quality improvement; information 
</p>
<p>systems; program evaluation; and research that can affect the continuation, revision, 
</p>
<p>and development of policies that affect services delivery. Finally, any number of eco-
</p>
<p>nomic, social, and/or political factors (determinants) can affect each and every one of 
</p>
<p>the issues identified above and may only reveal themselves during the policy process.
</p>
<p>The measures of morbidity, mortality, and disability create a consistent narrative 
</p>
<p>about behavioral health across age, gender, regions, and economies. Global, 
</p>
<p>regional, and national studies that examine the global burden of disease (GBD), 
</p>
<p>disability-adjusted life years (DALYS), and the social determinants of health (SDH) 
</p>
<p>have different frames, but all are central to understand how best to address behav-
</p>
<p>ioral health services inequities from a policy perspective.
</p>
<p>Behavioral health problems are a leading cause of health-related disability across 
</p>
<p>all age groups (GBD 2016 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence 
</p>
<p>Collaborators, 2017; Maselko, 2017; Murray &amp; Lopez, 1996; Whiteford et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2013). Further, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 35% of 
</p>
<p>the global burden of disease (GDB) has its roots in childhood (Baranne &amp; Falissard, 
</p>
<p>2018; Erskine et&nbsp;al., 2015; World Health Organization, 2014). Children and adoles-
</p>
<p>cents constitute almost a third (1.2 billion individuals) of the world&rsquo;s population 
</p>
<p>(UNICEF, 2012).
</p>
<p>National and global research estimates suggest behavioral health problems affect 
</p>
<p>between 10% and 20% of children and adolescents worldwide (Kieling et&nbsp;al., 2011; 
</p>
<p>National Research Council &amp; Institute of Medicine, 2009; Waddell, Hua, Garland, 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>353
</p>
<p>Peters, &amp; McEwan, 2007). Nearly 90% of children and adolescents live in low- 
</p>
<p>income and middle-income countries (LMIC), where they form up to 50% of the 
</p>
<p>population (Kieling et&nbsp; al., 2011). In the United States, studies report a 22&ndash;24% 
</p>
<p>increase in inpatient behavioral health admissions among children and adolescents 
</p>
<p>and 80% increase in hospital stays for children for mood disorders (Health Care 
</p>
<p>Cost Institute, 2012; Pfuntner, Wier, &amp; Stocks, 2013).
</p>
<p>Systematic reviews of mental health promotion and preventive interventions 
</p>
<p>show there are long-lasting positive effects on levels of functioning (e.g., activities 
</p>
<p>of daily living) and social and economic benefits (Barry, Clarke, Jenkins, &amp; Patel, 
</p>
<p>2013; Durlak &amp; Wells, 1997; Jan&eacute;-Llopis, Barry, Hosman, &amp; Patel, 2005; Patel 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Such interventions can mitigate the often &ldquo;poor fit&rdquo; that occurs when traditional 
</p>
<p>clinical training and practice models fail to address the clinically and socially com-
</p>
<p>plex presentations of children and adolescents with behavioral disorders. The success 
</p>
<p>of evidence-based decision-making, particularly in secondary prevention initiatives 
</p>
<p>(Aldrich et&nbsp;al., 2015; Rith-Najarian, Daleiden, &amp; Chorpita, 2016), is based on mak-
</p>
<p>ing decisions using the best available peer-reviewed quantitative and qualitative evi-
</p>
<p>dence and the systematic use of data and information systems (Brownson, Fielding, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Maylahn, 2009). However, only about 10% of randomized clinical mental health 
</p>
<p>trials for children and adolescents come from an LMIC (Kieling et&nbsp;al., 2011).
</p>
<p>There is ample evidence that behavioral disorders in childhood and adolescence 
</p>
<p>adversely affect young adult and adult outcomes (Almuneef et&nbsp; al., 2016; Bellis, 
</p>
<p>Lowey, Leckenby, Hughes, &amp; Harrison, 2014; Crouch, Strompolis, Bennett, Morse, 
</p>
<p>&amp; Radcliff, 2017; Hughes et&nbsp;al., 2017; Hunt, Slack, &amp; Berger, 2017; Ismayilova, 
</p>
<p>Gaveras, Blum, To-Camier, &amp; Nanema, 2016; Luby, Barch, Whalen, Tillman, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Belden, 2017; McGrath et&nbsp;al., 2017; Oh et&nbsp;al., 2018; Reuben et&nbsp;al., 2016; Sterling 
</p>
<p>et&nbsp;al., 2018; Trotta, Murray, &amp; Fisher, 2015). Hence, a developmental or life span 
</p>
<p>approach is essential. Such a course incorporates universal actions, includes all 
</p>
<p>social strata, and is proportionate to the level of disadvantage (World Health 
</p>
<p>Organization &amp; Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 2014). This approach will help 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;level the social gradient and successfully reduce inequalities in mental disorders&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(WHO &amp; Calouste, 2014, p.&nbsp; 10). By focusing on the relationships between and 
</p>
<p>among macro-level context, systems, society, and life-course stages, nations can 
</p>
<p>improve population behavioral health and reduce the risk of those mental disorders 
</p>
<p>exacerbated by social inequalities.
</p>
<p> Measuring and&nbsp;Developing Expert Evidence
</p>
<p>Social, statistical, and epidemiologic data regarding populations, health, and illness 
</p>
<p>have implications for global behavioral health policy, systems, and services across 
</p>
<p>the developmental life span. The data illustrate the magnitude of the relationships 
</p>
<p>among health, behavioral health, suicide, substance/alcohol use, intentional and 
</p>
<p>unintentional injuries, interpersonal and community violence, war and disasters, 
</p>
<p>and environmental factors across the life span.

</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to frame the necessary evidence necessary to change 
</p>
<p>policy. The World Health Organization, for example, drives the types of evidence 
</p>
<p>for addressing SDH (Kelly et&nbsp; al., 2007). Divided into two components, the five 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;action areas&rdquo; and nine themes focus on the conditions in which people are born, 
</p>
<p>grow, live, work and age (World Health Assembly, 2011). Shaped by the distribution 
</p>
<p>of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels, the SDH identi-
</p>
<p>fies health inequities, that is, the differences in health status seen within and between 
</p>
<p>countries (see Table&nbsp;1).
</p>
<p>In 2015, all United Nations (UN) member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development, with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 
</p>
<p>associated targets. The Agenda commits the UN member states &ldquo;&hellip; to the preven-
</p>
<p>tion and treatment of non-communicable diseases, including behavioural, develop-
</p>
<p>mental and neurological disorders, which constitute a major challenge for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development&rdquo; (United Nations General Assembly, 2015, p.&nbsp;8).
</p>
<p>Building upon the adoption of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 
</p>
<p>(WHO, 2013) and the Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol 
</p>
<p>(WHO, 2010) by the World Health Assembly, Goal 3, Targets 3.4 and 3.5 include 
</p>
<p>behavioral health as an integral element of national health policy, infrastructures, 
</p>
<p>and services delivery plans. &ldquo;Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being 
</p>
<p>for all at all ages&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;Good Health and Well-Being&rdquo;) has two targets directly 
</p>
<p>related to behavioral health. Target 3.4 aims to reduce premature mortality from 
</p>
<p>NCDs by one-third with a three-legged approach: promotion of mental health and 
</p>

<p>2030 are health promotion and disease prevention for physical, mental, and social 
</p>
<p>health while achieving health equity and reducing health disparities (Office of 
</p>
<p>Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2018). Healthy People 2030 continues 
</p>
<p>the SDH, life-course, and population-based perspectives from Healthy People 
</p>
<p>2020, with an additional emphasis on community capacity (Secretary&rsquo;s Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee on National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives for 
</p>
<p>2030, 2018).
</p>
<p>Community-based and community-driven initiatives are necessary to change 
</p>
<p>the multiple determinants of health that inhibit health equity to those determinants 
</p>
<p>that build and promote health equity, strengthening the integration of health sys-
</p>
<p>tems, services, and policies (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Medicine, 2017).
</p>
<p> Indicators
</p>
<p>Policymakers use a number of indicators to describe countries and their ability to 
</p>
<p>implement health policy priority initiatives successfully. The public policy issue 
</p>
<p>often establishes the framework and indicators, helped by national and international 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, policies, and legislation. Since we are dealing with numerous coun-
</p>
<p>tries, regions, naming authorities, and languages, there will be differences in termi-
</p>
<p>nologies and challenges in identifying which issues need to be addressed and if/how 
</p>
<p>services will be delivered.
</p>
<p> Economic Indicators
</p>
<p>One major indicator is the level of economic development in a country. The World 
</p>
<p>Bank (2018a, 2018b) categorizes countries by economies (low-, low-middle, upper- 
</p>
<p>middle, and high-income) and geographies (East Asia and Pacific, Europe and 
</p>
<p>Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, 
</p>
<p>South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa). The WHO follows the World Bank designa-
</p>
<p>tions and separates out high-income countries within each of these regions as a 
</p>
<p>seventh group.
</p>
<p>Why is economy such an important consideration? A country&rsquo;s financial status 
</p>
<p>affects how much it can or is able to allocate to identified, strategic concerns. Much 
</p>
<p>of the literature establishes individual and national poverty as a significant factor 
</p>
<p>that affects morbidity and mortality rates, infrastructure, employment, standard of 
</p>
<p>living, political/social stability, health provision, population health, and resiliency 
</p>
<p>to natural and man-made disasters (Balabanova et&nbsp;al., 2013; Bloom et&nbsp;al., 2011; 
</p>
<p>Forouzanfar et&nbsp;al., 2015; Maselko, 2017; Stubbs et&nbsp;al., 2016).

</p>
<p> Poverty
</p>
<p>Considered a measurement of deprivation, the poverty level of a nation is linked 
</p>
<p>intrinsically with the SDH and to the ability of a country to provide basic health 
</p>
<p>services. Most policy measures have two elements: (1) a measure of need (poverty 
</p>
<p>threshold) and (2) a measure of the resources and goods available to meet those 
</p>
<p>needs. The most common poverty measures are income-based poverty measures, in 
</p>
<p>which measures of need and the available resources are expressed in monetary 
</p>
<p>terms. The World Bank (2018a, 2018b) reports that, in 2015, 10% (736 million) of 
</p>
<p>people in the developing world lived on less than US $1.90 a day.
</p>
<p>However, the relative measure used in international comparisons and the official 
</p>
<p>poverty measure may not gauge the effect of non-income programs or resources, so 
</p>
<p>an alternative is to use multidimensional poverty tools that measure non-income- 
</p>
<p>based poverty dimensions. The preferred tool for measuring the SDGs is the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 2018) Multidimensional Poverty Index 
</p>
<p>(MPI). Approximately 1.3 billion individuals across 105 developing countries live 
</p>
<p>in multidimensional poverty, of which 1.1 billion people live in rural areas and 0.2 
</p>
<p>billion live in urban areas (Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, 
</p>
<p>2018). Eighty-three percent of all multidimensionally poor people live in sub- 
</p>
<p>Saharan Africa and South Asia (India, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh). 
</p>
<p>Two-thirds (889 million) of all multidimensionally poor people live in middle- 
</p>
<p>income countries. Almost 50% (665 million children) live in multidimensional pov-
</p>
<p>erty (Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, 2018).
</p>
<p>The UNDP MPI captures three dimensions and ten indicators of poverty (Alkire 
</p>
<p>&amp; Jahan, 2018). The three dimensions and ten indicators are health (nutrition, child 
</p>
<p>mortality), education (years of school attendance and years of school), and standard 
</p>
<p>of living (cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets). 
</p>
<p>These dimensions and indicators have been shown to be influential in child and 
</p>
<p>adolescent behavioral health.
</p>
<p> Frames
</p>
<p>Framing involves the definition or scope of a policy problem or image, that is, how 
</p>
<p>issues are categorized or portrayed. Policy often is linked to accepted national, 
</p>
<p>social, or cultural values; however, core values differ widely from country to coun-
</p>
<p>try and may or may not change over time. Further, policy issues are complex and 
</p>
<p>multifaceted. Behavioral health can be framed in terms of health, mental health, 
</p>
<p>population mental health, substance abuse, addiction, and more, often related to 
</p>
<p>disciplines (philosophies, epistemologies, and ontologies) and current social, politi-
</p>
<p>cal, and cultural frames.
</p>
<p>Currently, a number of global and national anchor frames are used. Anchor 
</p>
<p>frames are a tool to make sense of complex social issues that have many interrela-
</p>
<p>tionships or interdependent components. Simply stated, how we interpret, 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>357
</p>
<p> communicate, and understand goals and values in policy is based upon the frame or 
</p>
<p>frames we base our understanding, and these frames underscore the importance of 
</p>
<p>language and symbolic action in policymaking (Edelman, 1988; Fischer, 2003; 
</p>
<p>Stone, 2012; Yanow, 1996).
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Health as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Human Right&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The importance of health, and its definition, from a global perspective, changed 
</p>
<p>over seven decades. In 1946, the Constitution of the WHO defined health as &ldquo;a state 
</p>
<p>of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of 
</p>
<p>disease or infirmity.&rdquo; In 1948, Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (UDHR) also mentioned health as part of the right to have an adequate stan-
</p>
<p>dard of living. In 1966, the International Covenant of Economic, Social, and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights (ICESCR) codified health as a &ldquo;human right&rdquo; and first addressed the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;underlying determinants of health.&rdquo; In 1989, the UN Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child specifically framed health as a human right that is universally applicable 
</p>
<p>to all children, regardless of the culture of a society (United Nations General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, 1989).
</p>
<p>Since that time, numerous international human rights treaties have recognized or 
</p>
<p>referred to the right to health and codified health as a human right in international 
</p>
<p>and domestic declarations, legislation, and policies. These treaties argue fundamen-
</p>
<p>tal human needs create human rights obligations on the part of both the public and 
</p>
<p>private sectors. However, studies on indicators that tease out the political determi-
</p>
<p>nants of health are rare. For their analysis of health policy performance in 43 
</p>
<p>European countries, Mackenbach and McKee (2013) developed a set of process and 
</p>
<p>outcome indicators that may affect the implementation of effective health policies 
</p>
<p>at a national level. Process indicators measured the degree of implementation of 
</p>
<p>policies that had proved effective, while outcome indicators measured the impact of 
</p>
<p>these policies on the exposure of the population to health risks (prevalence) and the 
</p>
<p>impact on population health. They concluded that various levels of implementation 
</p>
<p>of preventive health policy measures were caused by both the &ldquo;will and the means&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>of national governments to implement policies. Stuckler and Basu (2013) suggest 
</p>
<p>there is correlation between decreased health care and failed government austerity 
</p>
<p>programs.
</p>
<p> Social Determinants of&nbsp;Health
</p>
<p>In 2008, the Commission on Social Determinants of Health defined the social deter-
</p>
<p>minants of health (SDH) as &ldquo;These inequities in health, avoidable health inequali-
</p>
<p>ties, arise because of the circumstances in which people grow, live, work, and age, 
</p>
<p>and the systems put in place to deal with illness. The conditions in which people live 
</p>
<p>and die are, in turn, shaped by political, social, and economic forces&rdquo;(Commission 
</p>
<p>on Social Determinants of Health, 2008, [i]). The World Health Assembly urged the 
</p>
<p>Global Services, Systems, and&nbsp;Policy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>358
</p>
<p>adoption of the SDH, especially for priority public health programs and research on 
</p>
<p>effective policies and interventions (World Health Assembly, 2009, May 22). Hence, 
</p>
<p>an individual&rsquo;s right to health must also address how to reduce these social (societal) 
</p>
<p>determinants of health. Common nomenclature for SDH includes &ldquo;health inequi-
</p>
<p>ties,&rdquo; &ldquo;health inequalities,&rdquo; or &ldquo;disparities.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Global frames are re-anchored or reframed to meet the needs of local, regional, 
</p>
<p>or national entities. Although the concept of SDH recently has broadened to encom-
</p>
<p>pass both the social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDs), a 2004 WHO 
</p>
<p>summary report on the prevention of mental disorders listed the social, environmen-
</p>
<p>tal, and economic determinants of mental health (p.&nbsp; 21). A decade later, the US 
</p>
<p>Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2014, 2015) and the UN/WHO Sustainable Development 
</p>
<p>Goals specifically addressed the social and behavioral determinants of health 
</p>
<p>(SBDs).
</p>
<p> Millennium Development Goals/Sustainable Development Goals
</p>
<p>In 2000, the UN/WHO Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) committed world 
</p>
<p>leaders to eight global goals that would reduce poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, 
</p>
<p>environmental degradation, and discrimination against women. In 2015, the MDGs 
</p>
<p>were recast within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals (SDGs). The 17 new SDGs (aka Global Goals), building upon 
</p>
<p>the original MDGs, seek to eliminate rather than reduce poverty and have specific 
</p>
<p>targets to achieve for health, education, and gender equality. Goal 3 of the SDGs 
</p>
<p>clearly place mental (behavioral) health within the framework of health.
</p>
<p> The European Framework for&nbsp;Action on&nbsp;Mental Health and&nbsp;Well-Being
</p>
<p>The European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being, formed in 2008, resulted in 
</p>
<p>the EU Joint Action for Mental Health and Well-being: Mental Health in All Policies 
</p>
<p>initiative in 2013 (EU Joint Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing, 2016). The 
</p>
<p>objective of the EU Joint Action is threefold: (1) the promotion of mental health and 
</p>
<p>well-being, (2) prevention of mental disorders, and (3) social inclusion of persons 
</p>
<p>with serious mental disorders. It focuses across five areas: (1) workplace mental 
</p>
<p>health; (2) school mental health; (3) community-based mental health care; (4) 
</p>
<p>e-health initiatives targeted to depression and suicide; and (5) the integration of 
</p>
<p>mental health in all policies (EU Joint Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing, 
</p>
<p>2016).
</p>
<p>To accomplish this, the EU JA MH-WB involved its 28 member states, the EU, 
</p>
<p>pertinent stakeholders, and international organizations, using national working 
</p>
<p>groups, to inform the EU (multi-country) working groups on national situations, 
</p>
<p>capacity building, and commitments among stakeholders. The European Framework 
</p>
<p>is the culmination of an EU Green Paper (European Communities, 2005), earlier

<p>works by the European Pact for Mental Health and Wellbeing, and the WHO&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Global and European Mental Health Strategies and Action Plans.
</p>
<p> Mental Health in&nbsp;All Policies (MHiAP)
</p>
<p>The UN/WHO focus on health in all policies (HiAP) requires governments to exam-
</p>
<p>ine the consequences of public policies that do not address the social determinants 
</p>
<p>of health and to better prioritize efforts and capacity building to improve population 
</p>
<p>health (Pena et&nbsp; al., 2013). The specific mention of mental health promotion and 
</p>
<p>prevention as a critical NCD target within the larger global health and sustainable 
</p>
<p>development agendas shows how the reframing of mental illnesses as noncommu-
</p>
<p>nicable diseases may be a first step to reducing the stigma attached to mental ill-
</p>
<p>nesses and the integration of mental health and physical health promotion and 
</p>
<p>prevention efforts and initiatives. The EU Joint Action for Mental Health and Well- 
</p>
<p>being: Mental Health in All Policies initiative has 14 points of discussion, of which 
</p>
<p>two, measuring and monitoring MHiAP and translating MHiAP into practice, are of 
</p>
<p>especial importance for implementation and assessment.
</p>
<p>Projects, such as the European Commission&rsquo;s Mapping NCD project (Berg 
</p>
<p>Brigham et&nbsp;al., 2016), and studies on issues surrounding policy, implementation, 
</p>
<p>and governance (Bauman, King, &amp; Nutbeam, 2014; Oneka et&nbsp;al., 2017; Stahl, 2018; 
</p>
<p>Storm, Harting, Stronks, &amp; Schuit, 2014; Synnevag, Amdam, &amp; Fosse, 2018; Van 
</p>
<p>Vliet-Brown, Shahram, &amp; Oelke, 2018) hopefully will provide information to 
</p>
<p>ensure that we do reach the goal of mental health in all policies.
</p>
<p> Data from&nbsp;a&nbsp;Policy, Systems, and&nbsp;Services Perspective
</p>
<p>How can we best monitor and measure actions to address the SDGs that can inform 
</p>
<p>policymaking, evaluate implementation, and ensure accountability? What data do 
</p>
<p>we collect? How do we normalize the data so we know we are comparing apples 
</p>
<p>with apples, specifically red apples with red apples? How do we disaggregate data 
</p>
<p>to understand better baseline levels and potential impacts of policies? While these 
</p>
<p>are important questions, the answers and the processes necessary to produce the 
</p>
<p>answers and the system in which to collect and use the data are complex.
</p>
<p>The typical data sources are data generated through civil registries, vital statis-
</p>
<p>tics, economic and labor force statistics, educational systems, administrative sys-
</p>
<p>tems of governments, utilities, geospatial and environmental agencies, and central 
</p>
<p>banks. These include, but are not limited to, population and housing censuses, agri-
</p>
<p>cultural censuses, economic surveys and censuses, and periodic household surveys. 
</p>
<p>If the data are collected, there is no guarantee the available data are current. There 
</p>
<p>often are considerable time lags between data collection and data analysis, not to 
</p>
<p>mention publication and dissemination. Most government data are at least 1&ndash;2&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>Global Services, Systems, and&nbsp;Policy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>360
</p>
<p>out of date and, in the case of behavioral health data in the United States, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, often 2&ndash;3&nbsp;years older than year of publication.
</p>
<p>There are challenges surrounding the use of interdependent data. Census data is 
</p>
<p>central to calculating per capita economic data, civil registries and vital statistics 
</p>
<p>track access to services, and administrative data and household surveys address 
</p>
<p>safety net and other social programs usage by population. Administrative data in 
</p>
<p>behavioral health captures service performance and population data, but may not 
</p>
<p>capture more qualitative data collected in household surveillance sampling surveys.
</p>
<p>Explaining the differences in data availability across countries requires us to 
</p>
<p>examine a number of factors. These include variation in policy priorities, statistical 
</p>
<p>capacities, overall development statuses, institutional/infrastructure, and whether 
</p>
<p>the country sees the applicability or relevance of the indicators in its review of the 
</p>
<p>SDGs and its own policy focal areas. In addition, when looking at regional or sub-
</p>
<p>regional policy priorities, there is more data collection on economic goal indicators 
</p>
<p>than on environmental indicators. Further, targets under social goal indicators are 
</p>
<p>more likely to be linked to economic indicators, particularly those which address 
</p>
<p>the multidimensional aspects of poverty.
</p>
<p>Of the 161 SDG indicators, there are 20 core objectives, measurement concepts, 
</p>
<p>and indicators for the proposed monitoring system for action on the SDH (World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization, 2016). Approximately one-third of the indicators (6 out of 20) 
</p>
<p>are SDG indicators. A little over one-third of the indicators (8 out of 20) come from 
</p>
<p>existing WHO program assessment initiatives. The remaining third are already part 
</p>
<p>of routine information reported by WHO.&nbsp;At national levels, proposed indicators for 
</p>
<p>monitoring action on the SDH will come from numerous sectors, including health, 
</p>
<p>social protection, education, labor, and human rights.
</p>
<p>The availability of data on social determinants, however, is poor. Not all govern-
</p>
<p>ments collect the same type of data consistently over a period of years within the 
</p>
<p>same region or among a specific population. Something as simple as registering all 
</p>
<p>children who are born into a national registry does not happen in every country. 
</p>
<p>UNICEF estimates the births of nearly 230 million children under the age of five have 
</p>
<p>never been recorded (United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund, 2014). For example, 39% of 
</p>
<p>the children born in South Asia were unregistered and 44% of all births in sub-Saha-
</p>
<p>ran Africa were unregistered. Children are less likely to be registered if they come in 
</p>
<p>poor households or from remote or rural areas, have uneducated mothers, or are 
</p>
<p>female (United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund, 2014). Lack of a birth certificate or registra-
</p>
<p>tion may deny child access to basic education and health care. Without documenta-
</p>
<p>tion, that child does not exist; hence, the child is not counted. When children are not 
</p>
<p>counted, it is difficult to determine incidence or to estimate prevalence of disease.
</p>
<p> Establishing Prevalence to&nbsp;Show the&nbsp;Need for&nbsp;Services
</p>
<p>Prevalence is defined as a proportion of persons in a population in a given location 
</p>
<p>and at a particular time, e.g., a count of the number of people affected. Counts are 
</p>
<p>used to help determine need for resources, workforce requirements, scope of 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>361
</p>
<p>services, and other elements important to the delivery of behavioral health-care ser-
</p>
<p>vices. Prevalence estimates adjust the counts of the affected individuals to the size 
</p>
<p>of a source population. Prevalence data is critical for child and adolescent health, as 
</p>
<p>almost 75% of the cumulative prevalence of many behavioral health problems, 
</p>
<p>including but not limited to substance abuse, anorexia nervosa, major depressive 
</p>
<p>disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, have their onset before age 25.
</p>
<p>Reporting prevalence over a region or country can be problematic, as in the case 
</p>
<p>of the European Union and the United States. The Child and Adolescent Mental 
</p>
<p>Health in Enlarged European Union (CAMHEE) report provided a snapshot of child 
</p>
<p>and adolescent behavioral health policies and practices across 15 European coun-
</p>
<p>tries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Germany (Heidelberg), Greece, Hungary, 
</p>
<p>Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain (Catalonia), and the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom (England)) (Braddick, Carral, Jenkins, &amp; Jan&eacute;-Lopis, 2009). 
</p>
<p>About 50% of countries reported prevalence rates on positive mental health in chil-
</p>
<p>dren. More specifically, 13 of 15 countries reported the existence of information 
</p>
<p>about the prevalence of mental disorders, whereas just 8 of 15 reported collecting 
</p>
<p>the prevalence of some indicator of positive mental health (e.g., well-being, self- 
</p>
<p>esteem, quality of life, and resilience). Budgets dedicated to CAMH issues, how-
</p>
<p>ever, were rarely clearly identifiable and were often mixed with other funds 
</p>
<p>(Braddick et&nbsp;al., 2009).
</p>
<p>Within the United States, estimating prevalence is extremely difficult due to the 
</p>
<p>lack of a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; inclusive definition for a minimum functional level of impair-
</p>
<p>ment for an agreed-upon duration in determining prevalence of disorders among 
</p>
<p>children and adolescents (Brauner &amp; Stephens, 2006). The term &ldquo;serious emo-
</p>
<p>tional disturbance&rdquo; (SED), for example, is not a formal DSM-IV diagnosis. State 
</p>
<p>and federal agencies use that term to identify a population of children who have 
</p>
<p>significant emotional and behavioral problems, who have a high need for services, 
</p>
<p>and who may have a range of functional limitations (Center for Mental Health 
</p>
<p>Services, 1998).
</p>
<p>Therefore, estimates of the prevalence of behavioral disorders in children and 
</p>
<p>adolescents in the United States vary widely. While some researchers estimate that 
</p>
<p>between 13 and 20% of children and adolescents in the general population of the 
</p>
<p>United States experience a DSM mental disorder in a given year (National Research 
</p>
<p>Council &amp; Institute of Medicine, 2009), others differentiate the lifetime and current 
</p>
<p>prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents in the United States, 
</p>
<p>that is, 21% and 14.8%, respectively (Lu, 2017).
</p>
<p>Children and adolescents in specialty care systems, such as child welfare or juve-
</p>
<p>nile justice, have a much higher prevalence of mental disorders (Underwood &amp; 
</p>
<p>Washington, 2016; Yampolskaya, Sharrock, Clark, &amp; Hanson, 2017). However, the 
</p>
<p>estimated prevalence of SEDs was 8.0% (Kessler et&nbsp; al., 2012). More than half 
</p>
<p>(54.5%) of the SEDs were due to behavior disorders, and almost a third of SEDs 
</p>
<p>(31.4%) were attributed to mood disorders (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2012). Another interest-

<p>Interview disorders constituted more than 60% (63.5%) of children and adolescents 
</p>
<p>with SEDs (Kessler et&nbsp;al., 2012).
</p>
<p>Increasingly, in the United States and globally, comorbidity is seen as an index 
</p>
<p>of burden of disease, with more severe courses and outcomes for children and ado-
</p>
<p>lescents with mental disorders. These findings then beg the question of how granu-
</p>
<p>lar definitions should be, how to map between disorder differences effectively, and 
</p>
<p>how to determine risk and effect of high comorbidity with DSM disorders, as well 
</p>
<p>as with SED.&nbsp;This is another of the &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; problems in determining policy priori-
</p>
<p>ties for addressing global behavioral health problems in children and adolescents.
</p>
<p> Overview of&nbsp;Child and&nbsp;Adolescent Behavioral Health Policies 
</p>
<p>Globally
</p>
<p>In 2003, the WHO first identified treatment gaps, promoted training, addressed 
</p>
<p>evidence- based treatment, and promulgated a model national policy. Priority disor-
</p>
<p>ders were determined by higher frequency of occurrence, degree of associated 
</p>
<p>impairment, therapeutic possibilities, and long-term care consequences (WHO, 
</p>
<p>2003). The WHO also emphasized the diagnosis of children and adolescents cannot 
</p>
<p>be considered solely from a Western perspective. Presentation of a disorder would 
</p>
<p>vary across countries and cultural/societal subgroups within a country. It also 
</p>
<p>emphasized the importance of determining the degree of impairment and/or disabil-
</p>
<p>ity associated with a diagnosis. The specific diagnosis may be less important than 
</p>
<p>the degree of impairment of the disorder and what supports the individual will need 
</p>
<p>to participate in his or her society (WHO, 2003).
</p>
<p>Finally, the WHO stressed the importance of a continuum of care to ensure good 
</p>
<p>quality of care, compliance with best practices, and the ability to maintain children 
</p>
<p>and adolescents in the least-restrictive environments. Establishing guidelines for a 
</p>
<p>continuum of care can help in determining benchmarks and the collection of epide-
</p>
<p>miological and/or surveillance data to address treatment and services delivery 
</p>
<p>(WHO, 2003).
</p>
<p>In 2011, the WHO reported that spending on behavioral health was less than two 
</p>
<p>(US) dollars per person per year, less than 25 cents per person in low-income coun-
</p>
<p>tries (WHO, 2011). Further, only 36% of people who live in low-income countries 
</p>
<p>overall were covered by behavioral health legislation.
</p>
<p>In its 2013&ndash;2020 mental health action plan, the WHO defined mental health as &ldquo;a 
</p>
<p>state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope 
</p>
<p>with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to 
</p>
<p>make a contribution to his or her community&rdquo; (World Health Assembly, 2013, p.&nbsp;3). 
</p>
<p>In that report, mental health for children emphasized the developmental aspect of 
</p>
<p>mental health. The definition included for adolescents &ldquo;having a positive sense of 
</p>
<p>identity, the ability to manage thoughts, emotions, and to build social relationships, 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>363
</p>
<p>as well as the aptitude to learn and acquire an education, ultimately enabling their 
</p>
<p>full active participation in society&rdquo; (World Health Assembly, 2013, p.&nbsp;3).
</p>
<p> North America
</p>
<p>Both Canada and the United States lack a strong national strategy on behavioral 
</p>
<p>health for children, a national framework for indicators, and a national organization 
</p>
<p>to do the measuring. The systems of care in the United States and Canada also have 
</p>
<p>difficulty in assessing prevalence and are underfunded to address the need for ser-
</p>
<p>vices in an increasingly larger child and adolescent population.
</p>
<p>In the United States, the fragmented systems of care and difficulty normalizing 
</p>
<p>data across multiple reporting agencies are still problematic. Integrated cross- 
</p>
<p>referral social services and health-care data systems are rare. National studies sug-
</p>
<p>gest future surveillance should include standard case definitions of disorders to 
</p>
<p>reliably categorize and count disorders, as well as to ensure comparability and reli-
</p>
<p>ability of estimates across surveillance systems (Perou et&nbsp;al., 2013). However, the 
</p>
<p>continued lack of national health care and the inevitable federal vs. state&rsquo;s rights 
</p>
<p>issues result in &ldquo;best-guess&rdquo; analysis from numerous sampling surveys and longitu-
</p>
<p>dinal studies.
</p>
<p>In Canada, there was a concerted effort to address data collection about the 
</p>
<p>behavioral health of children (Junek, 2012). The provincial and national govern-
</p>
<p>ments wanted the data for policymaking, program construction, priority setting, and 
</p>
<p>resource allocation. The most requested data concerned baseline information about 
</p>
<p>children, specific groups of children, social determinants, characteristics of the user 
</p>
<p>and general population, comparisons of regions and years, and indicators of child 
</p>
<p>functioning, population health, and early identification data. However, across the 
</p>
<p>reports, there were no standard criteria used which would allow comparison across 
</p>
<p>governments (Junek, 2012). Hence, none of the published 64 reports could be con-
</p>
<p>sidered effective monitoring reports.
</p>
<p> South America
</p>
<p>The 2011 WHO-AIMS report covers 10 of the 12 countries in South America. Six 
</p>
<p>of the ten reporting countries in South America reported having a document that 
</p>
<p>explicitly stated a national mental health policy (Pan American Health Organization, 
</p>
<p>2013). However, it is important to note that, similar to the Latin American, 
</p>
<p>Caribbean, and Mexico group, governments in power often did not draft new poli-
</p>
<p>cies or implement current policies. In addition, 9 of 10 countries reported having a 
</p>
<p>national health plan. Only two countries have specific behavioral health legislation 
</p>
<p>Global Services, Systems, and&nbsp;Policy</p>

</p>
<p>(Brazil and Uruguay). In the eight reporting countries, the mental health budget as 
</p>
<p>a percentage of the total health budget had a median of 2.05%. Eight countries 
</p>
<p>reported having some coordinating structure (Pan American Health Organization, 
</p>
<p>2013). Eight countries reported the percentage of children treated ranges from 12% 
</p>
<p>to 38%, with an average of 23% of children and adolescents receiving services (Pan 
</p>
<p>American Health Organization, 2013).
</p>
<p> Brazil
</p>
<p>Children and adolescents comprise approximately 37% of the population of the 
</p>
<p>Northeast of Brazil (Janu&aacute;rio et&nbsp;al., 2017). The prevalence of child and adolescent 
</p>
<p>mental disorders were similar to global estimates (10&ndash;20%) with 3&ndash;4% of children 
</p>
<p>and adolescents classed with serious, chronic mental illnesses (Janu&aacute;rio et&nbsp; al., 
</p>
<p>2017). Mental health indicators started to be part of the group of national basic 
</p>
<p>health-care indicators after 2005 when Brazil increased their ambulatory care cen-
</p>
<p>ters. In addition, the number of Psychosocial Healthcare Centers (CAPS) overall 
</p>
<p>has increased dramatically. In Bahia State, CAPS increased from 14&nbsp;in 2002 to 89 
</p>
<p>by 2011; Pernambuco State almost tripled its number of CAPS facilities within the 
</p>
<p>last 4&nbsp; years. More importantly, Brazil formally recognized child and adolescent 
</p>
<p>mental health as a significant public health issue, which should be integrated into 
</p>
<p>the larger Brazilian mental health system, not just limited to educational and social 
</p>
<p>support systems (Janu&aacute;rio et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Asia and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Pacific Island Region
</p>
<p>Like the other regional reports, Asia and the Pacific Island region are difficult to 
</p>
<p>compile as a single view (OECD &amp; World Health Organization, 2012). Often 
</p>
<p>divided into five regions (North and Central Asia, South and Southwest Asia, 
</p>
<p>Southeast Asia, East and Northeast Asia, and the Pacific), the national, economic, 
</p>
<p>and ethnic complexity of the region make it difficult to provide country compari-
</p>
<p>sons (UNESCAP, 2017), especially when conducting SDG trend analyses. Only 64 
</p>
<p>of the 244 global SDG indicators, with two or more data points, are collected in fifty 
</p>
<p>percent or more of the countries in the region. Although 89% of Tier 1 indicators 
</p>
<p>have some data, less than 90% of Tier 1 indicators are collected on a regular basis 
</p>
<p>(UNESCAP, 2017). In addition, data availability across the 17 goals is uneven. For 
</p>
<p>SDG Goal 3: Good health and well-being, one or more data points are available for 
</p>
<p>many of the indicators; however, a little over a quarter of indicators are unavailable 
</p>
<p>(48 indicators are available for trend analysis, 22 indicators have an OK status, 4 
</p>
<p>have limited status, and 26 are unavailable) (UNESCAP, 2017).

<p> Southeast Asia Region (SEAR)
</p>
<p>In 2011, seven of the ten countries in the WHO Southeast Asia region (SEAR) reported 
</p>
<p>a dedicated mental health policy (World Health Organization, 2011). In 2017, nine 
</p>
<p>countries had a stand-alone mental health plan or policy, and eight countries had 
</p>
<p>updated their plans or policies since 2013 (World Health Organization, 2018).
</p>
<p> Australia
</p>
<p>The Australian mental health &ldquo;system&rdquo; is a complex system comprised of cross- 
</p>
<p>sector and inter-jurisdictional initiatives, with governments at federal and state lev-
</p>
<p>els that influence policy, strategy, funding, laws and legislation, regulations, and 
</p>
<p>public and private services delivery entities (DeLoitte Australia, 2017). In addition 
</p>
<p>to its National Mental Health Strategy and National Mental Health Commission, its 
</p>
<p>Roadmap for National Mental Health Reform 2012&ndash;2022 places an emphasis on 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;prevention and intervention activities appropriate to each person&rsquo;s life-stage and 
</p>
<p>circumstances&rdquo; (Council of Australian Governments, 2012, p.&nbsp;15). This life span/
</p>
<p>developmental perspective is particularly key for child and adolescent behavioral 
</p>
<p>health.
</p>
<p>The second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and 
</p>
<p>Wellbeing determined the prevalence of mental disorders among children and ado-
</p>
<p>lescents in Australia was almost 14% (13.9%, or 1&nbsp;in 7) (Lawrence et&nbsp;al., 2016). 
</p>
<p>Almost 60% (59.8%) of children were diagnosed with mild mental disorders, a little 
</p>
<p>over a quarter (25.4%) of the children were diagnosed with moderate mental disor-
</p>
<p>ders, and almost 15% (14.7%) were diagnosed with severe mental disorders 
</p>
<p>(Lawrence et&nbsp;al., 2016). The Survey also showed a significant association between 
</p>
<p>the presence of a mental disorder and suicidal behavior (Zubrick et&nbsp;al., 2016).
</p>
<p>In the national Young Minds Matter survey, Johnson et&nbsp;al. (2016) found that 17% 
</p>
<p>of all 4- to 17-year-olds used services for emotional or behavioral problems. Of 
</p>
<p>those children with mental disorders, a little over 50% (56.0%) used available 
</p>
<p>services.
</p>
<p>More recently, Wave 6 of the K-cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian 
</p>
<p>Children of adolescents who experienced bullying determined there was a marked 
</p>
<p>increased incidence of mental disorders and heightened risk of poor mental health 
</p>
<p>outcomes, self-harm, and suicidal ideation and behaviors (Ford, King, Priest, &amp; 
</p>
<p>Kavanagh, 2017).
</p>
<p>Over $9 billion annually is spent on mental health-related services in Australia to 
</p>
<p>serve the approximately 8.6 million, or 45% of Australians aged 16&ndash;85 will experi-
</p>
<p>ence a common mental health-related condition such as depression, anxiety, or a 
</p>
<p>substance use disorder in their lifetime, with an annual prevalence rate of 20% (1&nbsp;in 
</p>
<p>5) (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2018). Behavioral health problems 
</p>
<p>are estimated to be responsible for 12% of the total burden of disease in Australia, 
</p>
<p>Global Services, Systems, and&nbsp;Policy</p>

</p>
<p>with 1&nbsp;in 4&nbsp;years lived with a disability due to behavioral health disorders the lead-
</p>
<p>ing cause of non-fatal burden (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2018).
</p>
<p> Africa
</p>
<p>Africa is often broken into sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. Sub-Saharan 
</p>
<p>Africa includes all countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara, 
</p>
<p>also referred to as East Africa, West Africa, and South Africa. North Africa covers 
</p>
<p>Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. There are 55 recognized countries in 
</p>
<p>Africa. Africa is also one of the most diverse continents; the sub-Saharan region of 
</p>
<p>Africa contains over 1000 languages, which is around one-sixth of the world&rsquo;s total 
</p>
<p>number of languages.
</p>
<p>Behavioral health issues generally are a very low priority in health services poli-
</p>
<p>cies. In Africa, the majority of morbidity and mortality occurs from communicable 
</p>
<p>diseases and malnutrition, and the armed conflicts and/or natural disasters in Africa 
</p>
<p>have resulted in burgeoning refugee and displaced populations.
</p>
<p>Of the 45 African member states surveyed in the WHO&rsquo;s 2011 Mental Health 
</p>
<p>Atlas project, 30 reported they have an existing mental health plan and 20 reported 
</p>
<p>they have existing mental health policies (World Health Organization, 2011). 
</p>
<p>Seventy percent of African countries allocate less than 1% of the total health budget 
</p>
<p>to mental health (Bird et&nbsp;al., 2011). Africa also has the lowest rate of mental health 
</p>
<p>outpatient facilities, at 0.06 per 100,000 people (World Health Organization, 2011). 
</p>
<p>Of the five countries in Africa which are reported in the Atlas survey, none had any 
</p>
<p>prevention or promotion programs in schools.
</p>
<p> South Africa
</p>
<p>Children and adolescents may represent up to 50% of the population in low- and 
</p>
<p>middle-income countries in Africa. However, even upper-middle-income countries 
</p>
<p>may not have a vibrant child and adolescent mental health policy. In 2003, South 
</p>
<p>Africa developed a national child and adolescent mental health policy as a policy 
</p>
<p>and implementation framework for its nine provinces. A policy review by Mokitimi, 
</p>
<p>Schneider, and de Vries (2018) found neither provincial child and adolescent mental 
</p>
<p>health policies nor specific implementation plans supporting the 2003 national pol-
</p>
<p>icy. Plans that did address child and adolescent mental health did so in a tangential 
</p>
<p>manner and within the context of communicable diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS and 
</p>
<p>tuberculosis), maternal and child mortality, and the Millennium/Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals (Mokitimi et&nbsp;al., 2018). However, specific goals for child and 
</p>
<p>adolescent behavioral health can address family disadvantage, abusive parenting, 
</p>
<p>and violence reduction, which in turn can reduce at-risk behaviors by adolescents, 
</p>

<p>367
</p>
<p>thereby improving developmental (psychological, behavioral, and physical health) 
</p>
<p>outcomes across the life span (Meinck et&nbsp;al., 2017).
</p>
<p> Central America and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Caribbean
</p>
<p>The countries and territories of Central America and the Caribbean often are orga-
</p>
<p>nized into two groups: (1) Central America, Mexico, and Latin Caribbean, who are 
</p>
<p>comprised of the Spanish-speaking countries, and (2) the non-Latin Caribbean, who 
</p>
<p>are comprised of the Dutch, English, and French-speaking countries. The subre-
</p>
<p>gions of the two groups are very different from each other. Each subregion includes 
</p>
<p>countries of different sizes; different population sizes, from 5000 to 2.5 million 
</p>
<p>inhabitants; different socioeconomic statuses; and different geographical locations, 
</p>
<p>on the continent or on islands. The languages spoken also vary widely, including 
</p>
<p>Dutch, English, French, Papiamento, Spanish, Caribbean Hindustani, and Antillean, 
</p>
<p>Hait&iuml;an, and English Creoles.
</p>
<p>However, the region is epidemiologically heterogeneous; many countries must 
</p>
<p>deal with the double burden of communicable and chronic noncommunicable dis-
</p>
<p>eases. Like North America, a major policy emphasis is to integrate behavioral health 
</p>
<p>into primary health care. A second policy emphasis is a universal health strategy 
</p>
<p>(PAHO &amp; WHO, 2017), approved by the PAHO member states in October 2014 
</p>
<p>(53rd Directing Council, 2014). Universal coverage and access would reduce ineq-
</p>
<p>uities by strengthening health systems and services and decrease morbidity, disabil-
</p>
<p>ity, injuries, premature mortality, and risk for other health conditions (PAHO &amp; 
</p>
<p>WHO, 2017).
</p>
<p>In Central America, Mexico, and the Latin Caribbean, eight countries currently 
</p>
<p>have a national mental health policy (Pan American Health Organization, 2013). In 
</p>
<p>the non-Latin Caribbean, 8 of 16 countries or territories have an explicit policy, 
</p>
<p>Haiti had recently begun preparing one, and the remaining 7 had no specific policy 
</p>
<p>(Pan American Health Organization, 2013). However, only three countries in the 
</p>
<p>Central America, Mexico, and the Latin Caribbean area had specific behavioral 
</p>
<p>health legislation, i.e., Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Cuba. In the non-Latin 
</p>
<p>Caribbean area, only one country, Belize, did not have specific behavioral health 
</p>
<p>legislation.
</p>
<p>Behavioral health funding is also problematic. In the countries of the Central 
</p>
<p>America, Mexico, and the Latin Caribbean, the median behavioral health budget 
</p>
<p>was 0.9%. In the non-Latin Caribbean, the median was 3.5%.
</p>
<p>All the countries in Central America, Mexico, and the Latin Caribbean have 
</p>
<p>some central coordinating structure. In the non-Latin Caribbean, only five countries 
</p>
<p>and territories have a coordinating entity at the Ministry of Health.
</p>
<p>The percentage of children and adolescents receiving treatment in the Central 
</p>
<p>America, Mexico, and the Latin Caribbean area ranges from 8% to 40%, with a 
</p>
<p>median of 23%. In contrast, in the non-Latin Caribbean, the average number of 
</p>
<p>children and adolescents receiving treatment is just 7.5%, making it the lowest in 
</p>
<p>Global Services, Systems, and&nbsp;Policy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>368
</p>
<p>the region. So, within even the Caribbean, there are major differences among the 
</p>
<p>Latin and non-Latin Caribbean. However, as with North America, the lack of a stan-
</p>
<p>dard definition for surveillance makes it more difficult to determine prevalence, 
</p>
<p>need, and services for children and adolescents with behavioral health problems.
</p>
<p> Implications for&nbsp;Behavioral Health
</p>
<p>Major gaps in data on adolescents pose one of the biggest challenges for behavioral 
</p>
<p>health policy and services. Not only are data on early adolescents aged 10&ndash;14 
</p>
<p>scarce, data on pre-adolescence/middle childhood (ages 5&ndash;9) is practically unknown. 
</p>
<p>Much of this has to do with the fact that fewer international indicators are disag-
</p>
<p>gregated for children aged 5&ndash;9 than for early childhood or adolescence. Further, 
</p>
<p>there are few internationally agreed-upon and collected indicators on adolescent 
</p>
<p>mental health, disability, level of disability, and quality of life. Worse, for many 
</p>
<p>developing countries, these data are simply not collected.
</p>
<p>Further, disaggregation of data and causal analyses are critical to gain a better 
</p>
<p>understanding of children and adolescents with behavioral disorders as well as the 
</p>
<p>effects of the social determinants of health on this population, need for services, 
</p>
<p>level of disability, and outcomes. Internationally accepted indicators disaggregated 
</p>
<p>by age, disability, sex, ethnicity, caste, and religion are essential to provide for cul-
</p>
<p>turally and societally appropriate programs and policies.
</p>
<p>There is a lack of numbers to address care in behavioral health services. 
</p>
<p>Determining prevalence and having a 360&deg; view for incidence reporting across pub-
</p>
<p>lic and private sectors are problematic. Two issues surrounding prevalence are defi-
</p>
<p>nition and standardization. Since there are no consistent national or international 
</p>
<p>criteria for the definition or standardization of prevalence data, the numbers are 
</p>
<p>incomplete and inaccurate.
</p>
<p>At a national level (United States), Brauner and Stephens (2006) offer the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing recommendations to address the definitional issues surrounding prevalence 
</p>
<p>as an argument for improving behavioral health services. The first steps are to 
</p>
<p>expand the research and establish the use of valid and reliable screening measures, 
</p>
<p>define levels of impairment in ranges, and update the standard definition (Brauner 
</p>
<p>&amp; Stephens, 2006). The next steps would be to create a standard &ldquo;Developmental 
</p>
<p>At-Risk Profile,&rdquo; remove barriers to treatment, and create and implement a new 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early Childhood Mental Health Plan&rdquo; (Brauner &amp; Stephens, 2006).
</p>
<p>The use of standardized, fully structured, self-administered epidemiologic ques-
</p>
<p>tionnaires and standardized screening measures designed for families would assist 
</p>
<p>in the collection of data to help in the diagnosis and early treatment of a disorder and 
</p>
<p>complex, multi-morbid disorders. As noted earlier, there is little consensus on how 
</p>
<p>minimum functional impairment should be defined or measured. Without a clear 
</p>
<p>definition or guideline, children and adolescents will not receive the appropriate 
</p>
<p>levels of treatment and supports they need based upon level of impairment. 
</p>
<p>A. Hanson and B. L. Levin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>369
</p>
<p>Misclassification of disorder results in skewed statistics as well as in inappropriate 
</p>
<p>diagnosis and treatment.
</p>
<p>As with any disease, the earlier practitioners diagnose and treat disorders, the 
</p>
<p>better responses patients have. With lifelong chronic diseases, this maxim becomes 
</p>
<p>even more important. Measures, such as the DALYS, clearly show the lifelong 
</p>
<p>impact of behavioral disorders on individual levels of functioning and disability as 
</p>
<p>well as larger societal concerns of morbidity and mortality. Creating family-focused 
</p>
<p>measures also allows us to approach the prevention, identification, and treatment of 
</p>
<p>behavioral disorders and accompanying morbid disorders from a generational, 
</p>
<p>holistic public health perspective. If the definition of health from a global perspec-
</p>
<p>tive is &ldquo;state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the 
</p>
<p>absence of disease or infirmity&rdquo; (WHO, 1948), then clearly we have a formidable 
</p>
<p>challenge ahead of us.
</p>
<p>Governments, NGOs, and professional associations can all play a role in helping 
</p>
<p>to push a global agenda for behavioral health across the life span (Remschmidt &amp; 
</p>
<p>Belfer, 2005). Each stakeholder has a role, whether it is in raising awareness through 
</p>
<p>public health prevention and promotion campaigns to help establish facilities to 
</p>
<p>provide services, to provide training programs for behavioral health-care workers, 
</p>
<p>or to advocate and ensure global conventions are followed internationally.
</p>
<p>Working with governments and NGOs to change behavioral health policy, ser-
</p>
<p>vices, and systems at global and national levels require intersectoral actions that are, 
</p>
<p>by definition, highly collaborative and voluntary. Creating a conducive policy 
</p>
<p>framework and approach to health brings together many of the issues touched upon 
</p>
<p>in this chapter, starting with effective communication and a common language. 
</p>
<p>Forming partnerships, creating a shared framework regarding visions and missions, 
</p>
<p>determining &ldquo;implementable&rdquo; and sustainable goals, garnering political support, 
</p>
<p>and ensuring transparency and accountability are all important elements in creating 
</p>
<p>consensus on policy priorities.
</p>
<p>An important consideration in global health policy is that &ldquo;one size does not fit 
</p>
<p>all.&rdquo; &ldquo;The one size&rdquo; should be addressed by a specific country due to its income, of 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, and/or political stability. However, all countries can agree in princi-
</p>
<p>ple that prevention and early intervention in child and adolescent behavioral health 
</p>
<p>is a critical issue, and they can support it as an actionable item. By using SDH and 
</p>
<p>SBD approaches in global behavioral health policymaking, we are looking at an 
</p>
<p>extremely complex issue that is compounded since SDH and SBD affect the very 
</p>
<p>fabric of society and the rationale of government. Nevertheless, with foresight, 
</p>
<p>planning, and adherence to a global agenda, such an objective may be achievable.

</p>
<p>in FM were inadvertently published with incorrect affiliation (city) information of

</p>
<p>&ldquo;While there have been some policy changes to improve health services delivery, 
</p>
<p>outcomes have not been sufficient in meeting the health needs of this population. 
</p>
<p>Clearly, developing amended and updated policies must address the needs of under-
</p>
