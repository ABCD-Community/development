<p>ABOUT C ATSKI LL 
 
 
CatSkill is an interactive multimedia package designed to teach descriptive cataloging in manual 
and automated environments. 
 
It deals with the creation of the bibliographic record using Anglo-American cataloguing rules second 
edition 2002 revision, and coding it using the MARC format for bibliographic data.  
 
CatSkill is a self-paced learning tool, that allows you to work at your own speed. If you have 
difficulty with a concept or need more practice, you can review the relevant module or section(s) 
of a module as often as you wish. If you are already familiar with the content of a module, you 
may choose to take the pre-test. If you pass the pre-test, you may continue to the next module.  
 
CatSkill keeps track of your progress through the course:  
&bull; It records your attempts and success in the test in each module.  
&bull; If you register as a student when you log on, it also remembers the page you reached in the 
</p>
<p>module you were working on. The first screen of the module gives you the choice of 
beginning again or resuming from where you left off.  
</p>
<p>&bull; If you register as a browser, it keeps your test results, but not a record of the last page you were 
on. 
</p>
<p>&bull; If you can&rsquo;t remember which modules you have done, click on View Results. 
 
Many educational institutions clean out their network servers daily, so these records will be 
thrown away. You will want to keep them&mdash;otherwise each time you log on, CatSkill will treat 
you as a new user, and this will become irritating. You can do this by copying your records onto a 
disk. Since network systems vary, you will need to ask your teacher or network administrator for 
precise instructions. 
 
Points to remember: 
&bull; Make sure you have a blank disk. 
&bull; Follow the instructions exactly. It is important that you do not put your disk in too late or 
</p>
<p>take it out too early.

<p>PREFACE 
 
 
This book provides basic instruction in descriptive cataloging and the MARC bibliographic 
format. It includes explanations and exercises, with answers at the back of the book. 
 
These skills are needed by all catalogers, whether professional or paraprofessional. The book is 
therefore equally suitable for university and college students studying library science, and others 
who want to know more about cataloging, with a specific goal or as part of their professional 
development. Since the bibliographic record is the foundation of all the tools used in a library, 
from catalog to bibliography to online database, it is important for all library staff to be familiar 
with at least the basics. 
 
The book is designed for use on its own, in a course of study, or together with the interactive 
multimedia training package CatSkill, details of which are available from the publishers. 
 
You may not always agree completely with the answers provided, and it will be useful to check 
them with a teacher or experienced cataloger. Despite the best endeavors of the creators of 
cataloging rules to standardize all cataloging procedures, there is often room for more than one 
approach or application of the rule. 
 
 
</p>
<p>NOTE FOR TEACHERS 
 
All the fundamentals of descriptive cataloging are covered here: using AACR2, and coding 
descriptions and access points into MARC format. There are many examples and exercises, 
together with answers for self-checking. 
 
Since it is impossible to include sufficient exercises for every student, or examples to address every 
possible cataloging problem, teachers should supplement the exercises to provide additional 
practice.  
 
It is also valuable to catalog real items. For reasons of space, photocopies of title pages, etc., are 
not included. Some examples have also been altered slightly to suit the requirements of particular 
exercises. It is strongly recommended that beginning catalogers use real items and more realistic 
representations of items (i.e., photocopies), in addition to those given here. 
 
The examples can also be used to practice full cataloging. MARC codes for classification numbers 
and subject headings are included, but answers are provided only for descriptive cataloging. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>NOTE ON CAPI TALIZ ATION 
 
 
Titles included in the text are capitalized according to standard library cataloging practice&mdash;that 
is, apart from names, only the first word of the title has a capital letter. This is intended to 
accustom library students and staff to this style. </p>

(CatSkill&mdash;module 2) 
 
 
Introduction 
The word catalog is used in many ways, sometimes with different meanings. The definition in the 
Anglo-American cataloguing rules is: 
</p>
<p>A list of library materials contained in a collection, a library, or a group of libraries, 
arranged according to some definite plan.  
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>Objects of the Catalog 
Charles A. Cutter defined the objects of the catalog in his Rules for a printed dictionary catalogue 
(1876): 
 
1. To enable a person to find a book of which either 
  (A) the author  
  (B) the title  is known 
  (C) the subject  
 
2. To show what the library has 
  (D) by a given author 
  (E) on a given subject 
  (F) in a given kind of literature 
 
3. To assist in the choice of a book 
  (G) as to its edition (bibliographically) 
  (H) as to its character (literary or topical). 
 
 
This statement was written over a hundred years ago. Have the objects of the catalog changed 
very much? Have they changed at all? Should we add or subtract any? Which are the most 
important? Discuss this in a group, or think about these questions yourself.

<p>Cataloging 
Cataloging is the preparation of bibliographic information for catalog records. Catalogers use a 
set of cataloging tools, which are the agreed international rules and standards. 
 
Cataloging consists of 
&bull; descriptive cataloging 
&bull; subject cataloging 
&bull; classification.

Descriptive Cataloging 
Descriptive cataloging describes an item, identifies access points and formats access points, using 
the Anglo-American cataloguing rules and appropriate name authority files. 
 
Subject Cataloging 
Subject cataloging determines subject headings for an item, which represent the subject(s) of the 
work in words and/or phrases, using Library of Congress subject headings or a similar authoritative 
subject headings list. 
 
Classification 
Classification determines a classification number for an item, which represents the subject of the 
work in a number and/or letters, using Library of Congress classification, Dewey decimal 
classification or a similar authoritative classification scheme, and provides a location for an item in 
a collection. </p>

<p>Cataloging Networks 
There are many cataloging networks within library sectors, regions, countries and internationally. 
The world&rsquo;s largest cataloging network, OCLC (Online Computer Library Center Inc.), has over 
80 million items cataloged, and libraries all over the world share its records.  
 
In addition there are many other specialized networks. 
 
 
Purposes of Cataloging Rules 
1. To provide consistency within a single library 
 That is, a description and headings created by one cataloger need to be consistent with a 
</p>
<p>description and headings created by another cataloger or at a different time. 
 
2. To provide consistency between libraries 
 In order to share catalog records and thus reduce costs in a centralized or cooperative 
</p>
<p>library system, libraries must use an agreed set of cataloging rules. 
 
3. To reduce time involved in cataloging 
 If codes did not exist, catalogers would have to start from scratch with every work they 
</p>
<p>cataloged. 
 
4. To provide ease of use for library users using more than one library  
 Cutter states: &ldquo;The convenience of the public is always to be set before that of the 
</p>
<p>cataloger.&rdquo; 
 
5. To ensure that the purposes of the catalog are achieved 
 That is, the catalog must enable users to find what they need efficiently and reliably.

The purpose of creating and maintaining a catalog is that library users can find what they need

THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 3) 
 
 
Introduction 
Library catalogs consist of bibliographic records for the works that make up a collection. The 
bibliographic record includes a description of the work, containing standardized information 
such as author(s) and title, publication and distribution details and the physical description of the 
work. It includes a heading that tells us the name of the author, title or other information under 
which the record will be found. It also includes tracing notes, or tracings, which tell us the other 
headings under which the work will also be found in the catalog.

</p>
<p>Access Points 
Users find records in the catalog by a person&rsquo;s name, title, series, organization or subject. The 
name or term a user searches for is called an access point, since it gives the user access to the 
record. It is also called a heading, since it is written at the top (head) of the record in a card, book 
or microfiche catalog. Catalogers determine the access points using cataloging rules, with 
particular attention to what users are likely to look for. 
 
Main Entry Heading 
When a catalog record is created, the cataloger decides that one of the access points is the main 
entry heading. It is usually the first-named author or the title. 
 
Added Entry Headings 
Added entry headings (i.e., the other access points) reflect other names&mdash;other authors, editors, 
illustrators, translators, titles, series and organizations&mdash;by which a user may look for the record. 
</p>
<p> 
Subject Headings 
Subject headings are also access points, since many users look for information on a subject 
without knowing particular authors or titles. 
 
Subject headings are decided in subject cataloging, rather than descriptive cataloging, but they 
usually form part of the bibliographic record. A catalog record also contains a classification 
number, so that the user can locate the item.  
 
Subject headings and classification are not dealt with in this book. 
 
 
Formats of Catalogs 
Increasingly library catalogs are automated, i.e., the records are stored on a computer, and clients 
find their information using a computer. 
 
However, other formats&mdash;including card, book, microfiche, computer printout and CD-ROM&mdash;
are also used. The major alternative, the card catalog, still provides a flexible, user-friendly 
method of storing and retrieving library records, especially in smaller libraries. Cards can be 
created by library staff using a word processor or a memory, electric or manual typewriter. Sets of 
cards are also bought from cataloging agencies or library suppliers. 
 
Standard access points&mdash;main entry, added entry and subject headings&mdash;were established for card 
catalogs. In a set of catalog cards, one card is provided for each access point, with the appropriate 
heading at the top of the card. An extra main entry card is used as a shelf list card. 
 
In computerized catalogs, each access point gives users the same view of the record. Users 
generally need to search using the correct heading. Users of sophisticated automated catalogs can 
look up almost any piece of information, or combination of details, to find a record.

INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC 
DESCRIPTION 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 4) 
 
 
Introduction 
The International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) was developed by the International 
Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), to provide a standardized way of 
describing items being cataloged. A general framework for ISBDs&mdash;called ISBD (G)&mdash;was agreed 
upon by IFLA in the early 1970s, published in 1977 and revised in 1992 and 2004. 
 
The description used in the Anglo-American cataloguing rules second edition (AACR2) is based on 
ISBD (G). 
 
Specific types of materials are described using ISBDs that are based on the ISBD (G). They 
include: 
ISBD (M) (Monographic Publications) 2002  
ISBD(CR) (Serials and Other Continuing Resources) 2002  
ISBD (CM) (Cartographic Materials) 1987 
ISBD (NBM) (Non-book Materials) 1987 
ISBD (A) (Antiquarian) 1991 
ISBD (PM) (Printed Music) 1991 
ISBD (CP) (Component Parts) 1988 
ISBD (ER) (Electronic Resources) 1997 
 
 
Areas of Description 
The description is divided into the following eight areas: 
&bull; Title and statement of responsibility 
&bull; Edition 
&bull; Material (or type of publication) specific details 
&bull; Publication, distribution, etc.  
&bull; Physical description 
&bull; Series 
&bull; Note 
&bull; Standard number and terms of availability. 
 
Some items require all areas of description. Most items do not need all eight areas; then the 
description includes only the appropriate areas. 
 
Elements 
Each area of the description contains a number of elements. The rules in AACR2 Part I describe 
the elements of each area in detail.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Punctuation 
Punctuation is used in the ISBD 
&bull; to show the beginning of each area 
&bull; to separate the elements within each area 
&bull; to identify particular elements by the punctuation that precedes them. 
 
Punctuation precedes (or comes before) each area or element within an area. Thus, size is always 
preceded by a semicolon (;), whatever else is in the physical description. 
 
e.g., xi, 309 p. : ill. ; 23 cm. 
 665p. ; 21 cm.

<p>EXERCISE 3.1  
Write out each of the following bibliographical records using ISBD arrangement. Begin each note and 
the ISBN on a new line. Retain the punctuation supplied. Remember that punctuation precedes each 
element and area.

<p>Punctuation Rules 
Punctuation in ISBDs is standardized. The following are general rules to be used as a guide: 
 
1. Each area is separated by a period, space, dash, space or a new line; notes are often given 
</p>
<p>separate paragraphs for readability. Although AACR2 does not specify punctuation at the end 
of an area when it is not immediately followed by another area (e.g., notes, ISBN), it is 
common practice to use a period (if there is no other punctuation mark). 
</p>
<p> 
Title and statement of responsibility area. - Edition area. - Material specific details area. - 
Publication, distribution, etc., area. - Physical description area. - (Series area) 
Note area. 
Note area. 
ISBN and terms of availability area. 
</p>
<p> 
2. Square brackets indicate information that has been taken from outside the &ldquo;preferred 
</p>
<p>sources&rdquo; for cataloging. 
 
3. Three periods indicate omissions: 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;An almanack for the year of Our Lord ... containing an account of the astronomical and 
other phenomena and a vast amount of information ... of the various nations of the 
world.&rdquo; 
 
</p>
<p>4. Parentheses ( ) are used for different purposes in different areas. 
 
5. Each area uses its own punctuation symbols to identify the elements within the area. The 
</p>
<p>rules for punctuation are given in Rule 1.0C of AACR2 and at the beginning of each section 
in each chapter.

Levels of Description 
The rules allow for three levels of description, with different degrees of detail at each level.  
  
The choice of level depends on the detail required by a particular library or cataloging agency, 
based on &ldquo;the purpose of the catalog or catalogs for which the entry is constructed&rdquo;&mdash;AACR2 
Rule 1.0D. 
 
For each level, the description should include at least the elements given in the following 
illustrations: 
 
First level of description: 
</p>
<p>Title proper / first statement of responsibility, if different from main entry heading in 
form or number or if there is no main entry heading. - Edition statement. - Material (or 
type of publication) specific details. - First publisher, etc., date of publication, etc. - 
Extent of item. - Note(s). - Standard number 
 
</p>
<p>Second level of description: 
Title proper [general material designation] = Parallel title : other title information / first 
statement of responsibility ; each subsequent statement of responsibility. - Edition 
statement / first statement of responsibility relating to the edition. - Material (or type of 
publication) specific details. - First place of publication, etc. : first publisher, etc., date of 
publication, etc. - Extent of item : other physical details ; dimensions. - (Title proper of 
series / statement of responsibility relating to series, ISSN of series ; numbering within the 
series. Title of subseries, ISSN of subseries ; numbering within subseries). - Note(s). - 
Standard number 
 
</p>
<p>Third level of description: 
Include all elements set out in the AACR2 rules that are applicable to the item being 
described.

ANGLO-AMERICAN C ATA LOGUING RULES  
SECOND EDITION 2002 REVISION (A ACR2R) 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 5) 
 
 
Introduction 
Anglo-American cataloguing rules were first published in 1967 in two editions&mdash;British and 
American. It was the first significant international attempt to standardize descriptive cataloging 
rules, to facilitate sharing and exchange of catalog records both nationally and internationally. 
 
In 1978 the second edition of AACR was published. It harmonized the separate British and 
American texts. Important changes were made, including some that had already been agreed to, 
and others proposed by users of the rules. Many of these were prompted by the growing 
automation of cataloging in libraries. 
 
In 1988 AACR2 was revised, but not enough for the editors to call it a third edition. It was 
therefore called Anglo-American cataloguing rules second edition 1988 revision.   
 
From time to time a set of amendments is published separately, and subsequently incorporated 
into a new named revision: Anglo-American cataloguing rules second edition 1998 revision, Anglo-
American cataloguing rules second edition 2002 revision. The 2002 revision is in loose-leaf format, 
to facilitate updating, and there have been further updates in 2003, 2004 and 2005.   
 
The Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR (JSC) is currently working towards a new 
standard, RDA: Resource description and access, scheduled for release in early 2009. 
 
The revised second edition of AACR is sometimes abbreviated to AACR2R, but this book uses the 
more usual abbreviation AACR2.   
 
 
Structure 
The rules are divided into two parts. 
 
Part I deals with the description of the item being cataloged. 
 
Part II deals with the headings (or access points) that are used to find the item in the catalog, and 
the references to those headings. 
 
In both parts the rules proceed from the general to the specific. 
 
Part I&mdash;Description of Different Materials 
The rules for description of specific types of material are closely based on the general rules for 
description&mdash;ISBD (G). 
 
The basic rules for description of all library materials are given in Part I, Chapter 1. The other 
chapters in Part I contain the rules for describing specific types of material, e.g., books, maps, 
sound recordings, graphic materials. The types of material covered by each chapter are listed in 
the first rule of the chapter, Rules 2.0A1, 3.0A1, 4.0A1 and so on. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>So the rules for transcribing the information for any type of material consist of the general rules 
in Chapter 1 together with the specific rules in the chapter for that material. 
 
Part I&mdash;Structure of  Chapters 
Each chapter in Part I is divided in the same way, using the same numbering style. 
 
Rules are numbered by  
   chapter.areaELEMENTdetail. 
 
E.g.,   5.1F2  
 
Music    Area 1   Statement of resp.   (Add a word ... if relationship ... is not clear) 
 
The order of the rules in each chapter follows the order of the areas in the description.

<p>Part I&mdash;Mnemonic Structure 
The first set of rules in each chapter from chapter 2 to chapter 12 is .0. 
(Chapter 1 is a bit different.) 
 
In each chapter dealing with the description of material, these rules provide important general 
information: 
 
 .0A Scope 
 .0B Sources of information 
 .0C Punctuation 
 .0D Levels of details in the description 
 .0E Language and script of the description 
 .0F Inaccuracies 
 .0G Accents and other diacritical marks 
 .0H Items with several title pages 
 .0J Description of whole or part (chapter 3 only) 
 
Similarly under each format, the arrangement is consistent within each area. 
For example, where .1 is the Title and Statement of Responsibility Area: 
 
 .1A Preliminary rule 
 .1B Title proper 
 .1C GMD 
 .1D Parallel titles 
 .1E Other title information 
 .1F Statement of responsibility 
 .1G Items without a collective title

<p>Descriptive Levels of Detai l 
Rule 1.0D specifies three levels of description. The purpose of the three levels is to allow libraries 
to provide the depth of description best suited to their users. 
 
The first level could be used for all material in an elementary school or small collection, or on a 
cataloging network for minimal level records. The second level provides a fuller description and is 
used by most libraries. The fullest level is that used by national libraries and research collections. 
 
Some of the factors that affect the decision on the fullness of a bibliographic description include 
&bull; library priorities 
&bull; importance of an item to the collection 
&bull; relative value of an item 
&bull; volume of incoming material 
&bull; availability and experience of staff to process the material 
&bull; needs of the user. 
 
 
An example of first level: 
 
</p>
<p>From welcomed exiles to illegal immigrants. - Rowman &amp; Littlefield, c1996. - xxii, 168 p. 
Includes bibliographical references and index.

MARC 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 5) 
 
 
Introduction 
MARC stands for MAchine Readable Cataloging. The description and headings of all items in 
the catalog are created according to the Anglo-American cataloguing rules. Coding into MARC 
format is simply transcribing the description and headings into a form that a computer system 
can read and manipulate. 
 
In the 1960s, librarians at the Library of Congress began work on a system for distributing 
cataloging information in machine-readable form. The Library of Congress, in consultation with 
other libraries, developed a standard format for recording cataloging information on computer 
tape. This development, known as MARC, has enabled libraries all over the world to exchange 
cataloging data with each other. 
 
Although the MARC format was developed to standardize machine-readable bibliographic data, 
many countries and even some library systems constructed their own versions of MARC.  
 
UNIMARC was created in an attempt to define one international version of the MARC format. 
Although UNIMARC is widely used, especially in Europe, it has not become the international 
standard. 
 
Librarians in the United States and Canada have harmonized their national MARC formats. 
British libraries are currently converting to MARC 21.  
 
 
Uses of the MARC Format 
The MARC format enables computers to sort and file catalog data for purposes such as: 
&bull; printing catalog data in a variety of formats such as subject bibliographies  
&bull; producing other products such as accessions lists, shelf lists, book and spine labels 
&bull; producing different types of catalogs such as microfiche and online public access catalogs 
&bull; standardizing a machine-readable format for bibliographic records for exchange of cataloging 
</p>
<p>data among libraries all over the world.  
 
 
MARC Manuals 
The Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress publishes 
the manual MARC 21 format for bibliographic data which guides catalogers using MARC. This 
manual includes instructions for the coding of cataloging data for monographs, serials and 
nonbook materials according to the MARC format.  
 
The Library of Congress also publishes MARC 21 format for authority data. It contains 
specifications for the coding of controlled headings&mdash;names, subjects and series. It includes the 
reference structure and the sources of the headings. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Supporting publications include: 
&bull; MARC 21 format for classification data  
&bull; MARC 21 format for holdings data 
&bull; MARC 21 format for community information 
&bull; MARC code list for countries 
&bull; MARC code list for geographic areas 
&bull; MARC code list for languages 
&bull; MARC code list for organizations 
&bull; MARC code lists for relators, sources, and description conventions. 
 
 
The MARC Record 
A MARC record is composed of three elements: 
&bull; the record structure 
&bull; the content designation 
&bull; the data content of the record. 
</p>
<p> 
The record structure is derived from an international standard for the exchange of information on 
magnetic tape. 
 
The content designation comprises the codes and conventions defined by the MARC format. 
They identify the data elements within a record and enable the computer to manipulate the data. 
 
The content of the data elements in the catalog record is created using bibliographic standards 
like AACR2 and Library of Congress subject headings. The content of some other data elements &mdash;
e.g., the date of the creation of the record&mdash;is defined in the MARC format. 
 
 
Fields and Tags 
In a computer system, a record is a collection of related fields. 
 
In a MARC record, a field contains either coded information (e.g., the date of entry onto the 
system) or bibliographic information (e.g., the physical description or a subject heading). 
 
Each field has an identifying label. This label is called a tag and consists of three digits. 
 
For example, the edition area&mdash;now called the edition field&mdash;uses the tag 250. </p>

<p>The Record Structure 
A MARC record consists of three main components: 
&bull; the leader 
&bull; the directory 
&bull; the variable fields. 
 
The Leader 
Here is a MARC record:

650  0  $aAfro-Americans in literature. 
650  0  $aRace in literature. 
 
The top line of the record is known as the leader.  
 
The leader is the first field of the record. It has 24 characters, including some blanks, shown by 
the symbol # in this example. It contains information needed by the computer system, like the 
physical format of the material, the date the record was entered onto the system and so on. 
 
We will not look at the leader in any detail in this book. 
 
Display of  the MARC Record 
MARC records are displayed using different symbols and conventions, depending on the 
computer system. Specific differences are referred to later in this chapter. 
 
The Directory 
The directory is constructed by the computer from the bibliographic record. It shows which tags 
are used in the record and where they are. It is not part of the MARC display for catalogers or 
catalog users. It is used by the programmer and the computer. 
 
Here is part of a record in MARC communications format. It shows the leader, followed 
immediately by the directory:

<p>The Data Content 
The data content is divided into variable fields. There are two kinds of variable fields: 
&bull; variable control fields 
&bull; variable data fields. 
</p>
<p> 
The control fields contain coded information that is used in processing machine-readable records. 
The data fields contain the bibliographic information of the record, i.e., the description, main 
and added entries, subject headings and the classification or call number. 
 
 
Variable Fields and Tags 
The data is recorded in fields, each of which is identified by a three-character tag. The fields are 
grouped into blocks according to the first character of the tag. X is used to represent any other 
character in the tag. 
 
For bibliographic records, the blocks are: 
0XX Variable control fields, identification and classification numbers, etc. 
1XX Main entry 
2XX Titles, edition, imprint 
3XX Physical description 
4XX Series statements 
5XX Notes 
6XX Subject added entries 
7XX Added entries other than subject, series 
8XX Series added entries 
9XX Reserved for local use 
 
Control Fields 
Control fields contain coded information that is used in processing machine-readable records. We 
do not look at the control fields in this book. 
 
Variable Data Fields 
Variable data fields contain the bibliographic information we regard as the traditional catalog 
record. 
 
In the MARC record, they are: 
1XX Main entry 
2XX Titles, edition, imprint 
3XX Physical description 
4XX Series statements 
5XX Notes 
6XX Subject added entries 
7XX Added entries other than subject, series 
8XX Series added entries

<p>Content Designation 
Variable data fields use three levels of content designation. Content designators identify and 
characterize the data elements that make up the MARC record. Tags are the three-character labels 
used to identify the field. Indicators provide additional information about how to process the 
data in a field. Subfield codes precede each data element. 
 
Tags 
Here is our MARC record. The tags are bolded:

Indicators 
Sometimes we want to tell the computer to do more than just store the information. For 
example, in the 245 - Title and Statement of Responsibility field, we want to indicate whether or 
not the title should be an access point in the catalog. We may also want to tell the computer to 
ignore some characters at the beginning of the title when it files the title. 
 
This is done by the use of two extra characters. 
The title field in our record is:  
245 1 0 $aPlaying in the dark :$bwhiteness and the literary imagination 
</p>
<p>/$cToni Morrison. 
 
1 tells the computer to make an added entry for the title. Note that there is no special added 
entry field for the title in a MARC record. 
 
0 shows that there are no characters to be ignored when the title is filed in alphabetical order. So 
the item will be filed under &ldquo;P&rdquo; for &ldquo;Playing&rdquo;. 
 
In the example 
245  1 4 $aThe country house :$bclassic style for an elegant home /$cJenny 
   Gibbs ; edited by Alison Wormleighton. 
 
1 tells the computer to make an added entry for the title.  
 
4 shows that four characters need to be ignored when the title is filed in alphabetical order. So the 
item will be filed under &ldquo;c&rdquo; for &ldquo;country&rdquo;, not &ldquo;T&rdquo;, &ldquo;h&rdquo;, &ldquo;e&rdquo; or the space. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In fields where indicators are not needed, they are left blank. The symbol # is sometimes used to 
represent a blank (e.g., in the MARC codes at the back of this book). 
 
Subfields and Subfield Codes 
The data elements within a field are called subfields. 
 
Each subfield is introduced by a subfield code. These codes enable the computer to identify all 
the pieces of information that make up the record. Thus the system can retrieve any information 
it needs. 
 
For example, in the publication, distribution field, the place of publication is stored in subfield 
&ldquo;a&rdquo;, the publisher in subfield &ldquo;b&rdquo; and the date of publication in subfield &ldquo;c&rdquo;. 
 
&ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo; and &ldquo;c&rdquo; are called data element identifiers. 
 
Delimiters 
In AACR2 format, data elements are separated by standard punctuation. In MARC format, 
subfields are also separated by symbols called delimiters. In this book, we use the symbol $. 
Depending on the computer system, the delimiter may be a hash (#), a double dagger (&Dagger;), a pipe ( 
| ) or another symbol. 
 
The subfield code consists of two characters&mdash;the delimiter and the data element identifier (the 
letter that identifies the particular data element or subfield). 
 
For example, in this publication, distribution field, the subfield codes are bolded: 
260  $aCambridge, Mass. :$bHarvard University Press,$c1992. 
 
Note that the delimiter also takes the place of a space. There is no space between the punctuation 
mark and the subfield. 
 
Most systems do not display &ldquo;$a&rdquo;, since it is the default coding for the beginning of a field. Most 
systems will also not require you to enter it when you enter the bibliographic data. However it is 
included in this book, so that you understand its presence and meaning.

<p>Other Characters 
Computer systems also use characters to indicate the ends of fields, subfields and records. They 
let the computer know what information to display and where it belongs, and enable retrieval of 
information from the correct parts of the record. 
 
Most systems do not display these characters, and catalogers rarely have to deal with them. Below 
is a &ldquo;system&rdquo; view of our MARC record. &ldquo;&para;&rdquo; indicates the end of each field; &ldquo;&sect;&rdquo; indicates the end 
of the record. Other systems use different characters.

Here is an extract from the MARC 21 bibliographic format:

Indicators 
Both undefined; each contains a blank 
 
Subfield Codes 
$a International Standard Book Number (NR)

$z Cancelled/invalid ISBN (R) 
$6 Linkage (NR)  
 
</p>
<p> Field 020 does not end with a period. 
 
</p>
<p> 
 
The symbol (R) in the heading stands for repeatable, and means that the field can appear more 
than once in the record. If for example an item has two ISBNs, each ISBN is recorded using a 
separate 020 tag.  
 
The indicators are undefined. This means that we enter two blanks following the tag. 
 
The subfield for the ISBN is denoted by the subfield code $a, and is shown as (NR). That is, 
within one 020 field there can only be one subfield for an ISBN. A second ISBN will need a 
second field with its own tag and subfield code $a. 
 
Note the statement about the punctuation at the end of the field, since some fields always end in 
a period, some never end in a period, and some end in a period when there is no other 
punctuation mark at the end of the field.

AREAS OF DESCRIPTION 
(CatSkill&mdash;modules 7-14) 
 
 
Introduction 
This chapter introduces each of the areas of description, and provides practice transcribing and 
coding each area in turn. Examples are taken from monographs, serials and nonbook material. 
We saw in Chapter 4 that the structure of AACR2 makes it easier to find the rules for a particular 
element or area in each material-specific chapter. 
 
For example, the rules for Area 5 (Physical Description) are: 
General rules   Chapter 1  Rules 1.5A-E 
Monographs  Chapter 2  Rules 2.5A-E 
Computer files  Chapter 9  Rules 9.5A-E 
 
For each example in this chapter, transcribe and code only the area specified. In chapters 7-9 you 
will practice creating whole descriptions. 
 
 
Rules for Description 
Chapter 1 is used together with the chapter for the specific material you are describing. For 
example, in Rule 2.1B. Title proper, the first rule states &ldquo;Transcribe the title proper as instructed 
in 1.1B.&rdquo; However, there are more examples of books in Chapter 2 than in Chapter 1, which 
contains general examples. So you need to use the rules in these two chapters together. Start with 
Chapter 2, but expect to be referred often to Chapter 1 as well. 
 
This principle applies to each type of material &ndash; use Chapter 1 together with the material-specific 
chapter. Although the General Introduction of AACR2 advises you not to rely on the examples, it 
is very helpful to study them, since they are easier to understand than the legalistic wording of the 
rules. 
 
 
General Rules 
The general rules deal with 
&bull; sources of information 
&bull; organization of the description 
&bull; punctuation 
&bull; levels of description 
&bull; language of the description 
&bull; inaccuracies. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Area 1 : Tit le and Statement of Responsibility 
 
Main points include: 
&bull; For books, the chief source of information for the title and statement of responsibility area is 
</p>
<p>the title page. Chief sources of information for other materials are given at the beginning of 
each chapter. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The title proper is the chief name given to an item. An item sometimes has a title and an 
alternative title, which together constitute the title proper. When an item has a title and the 
same title in one or more other languages, we call the title(s) in other languages parallel 
title(s). 
</p>
<p>&bull; The general material designation (GMD) is inserted after the title proper to indicate the type 
of material. It is enclosed in square brackets&mdash;for example, [music]. The general material 
designation is optional but it is commonly used by catalogers. General material designations 
are listed in Rule 1.1C1. American libraries generally use list 2. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Sometimes, in addition to the title proper, an item has other title information. This usually 
follows the title proper on the title page. Other title information provides additional meaning 
to the title proper. It follows the title proper and general material designation. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The statement of responsibility identifies the person(s) or organization(s) responsible for the 
intellectual or artistic content of the item. An item can have more than one statement of 
responsibility. The statement of responsibility is transcribed from the item. A statement of 
responsibility can include more than one person or body. More than three persons or bodies 
sharing one level of responsibility are represented by the name of the first and [... et al.]. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Rules for capitalization, abbreviations and punctuation must be applied to the title and 
statement of responsibility area. Be particularly careful only to capitalize the words specified 
by the rules. 
</p>
<p>&bull; In MARC format, the tag for the title and statement of responsibility area is 245. The first 
indicator when a title added entry is needed is 1. The first indicator when no title added entry 
is needed is 0. The second indicator is the number of characters to be ignored when filing. 
Each subfield is introduced by a subfield code, e.g., $a. 
</p>
<p> 
 
 
EXERCISE 6.1  
</p>
<p>Refer to the rules for this area in the appropriate chapters of AACR2 and to the MARC codes at the

&bull; A new or different edition contains new information, or is in a different format. When an

<p>Area 3 : Material Specific Details  
 
</p>
<p>Main points include: 
&bull; For cartographic materials, the material specific details area is called mathematical data. The 
</p>
<p>prescribed sources of information for this area are the item itself, the container and 
accompanying material. Mathematical data includes statement of scale, statement of 
projection, and optionally, statement of coordinates and equinox. 
</p>
<p>&bull; For music, this area contains the musical presentation statement. This indicates the physical 
presentation of the music (e.g., score, miniature score, score and parts). The musical 
presentation statement is optional. 
</p>
<p>&bull; For computer files, this area records the file characteristics. These include the type of file and 
the number of records and/or statements in the file. Information about the file characteristics 
is taken from any source. 
</p>
<p>&bull; For serials, this area records the numeric and/or alphabetic, chronological and other 
designations. This is very important in serials records. Information about the numeric and/or 
alphabetic, chronological, or other designation is taken from the first issue where possible. 
When the first issue is not available, the record should enclose information about the first 
issue in square brackets, and indicate in a note which issue was used. 
</p>
<p>&bull; In microforms, the area is used for cartographic materials, music and serials. For example, for 
a microfiche of a map, we give the mathematical data as we did for a map. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Rules for capitalization, abbreviations and punctuation must be applied to this area. 
 
 
 
EXERCISE 6.3

details of a nonbook item are usually taken from the item itself, its container and 
accompanying material. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The elements of this area are given in the order: Place : publisher, date. 
&bull; The place of publication is, wherever possible, given as a city, town or suburb. If there is more

<p>than one place, give the first named place. 
&bull; The publisher is the person or body that prepares and produces the item. 
&bull; The date of publication is the date of the edition being cataloged. The copyright date is the 
</p>
<p>year in which copyright was issued in the item. It is usually the same as the date of 
publication, since items are copyright as soon as they are published.

DESCRIPTION OF MONOGRAPHS 
(CatSkill&mdash;modules 7-14) 
 
 
Introduction 
The rules in AACR2 are intended to create consistent records for materials in different formats. 
There are also differences in cataloging, particularly in describing, different types of material. This 
book has a chapter each on monographs, serials and nonbook materials. By focusing on each of 
the different formats in turn, you will begin to appreciate the similarities and differences in 
cataloging different kinds of material. 
 
 
Rules for Description of Monographs 
As we have already seen, Chapter 1 of AACR2 states the general rules for description. Specific 
references to and examples of monographs are giving in Chapter 2. So you need to use the rules 
in these two chapters together. Start with Chapter 2, but expect to be referred often to Chapter 1 
as well.  
 
Although the General Introduction of AACR2 advises you not to rely on the examples, it is very 
helpful to study them, since they are easier to understand than the legalistic wording of the rules. 
 
 
EXERCISE 7.1  
</p>
<p>This chapter contains the information needed to describe a number of monographs. They cover a 
range of material, but cannot include every feature of every monograph in a library. Get as much 
practice as you can on different titles, especially if someone can check your descriptions.  
 
Begin by consulting the rules on sources of information. Taking the information from the correct place 
is your first step. 
 
Work through each area of the description, and, until you become familiar with the most common 
rules, check AACR2 frequently. Look up specific rules as you need them, but you can also learn from 
browsing, especially among the AACR2 examples.

<p>MARC Coding 
 
Introduction 
Once decisions are made by applying AACR2 rules, MARC coding consists of identifying the 
tags, indicators and subfield codes (called content designators), and adding the bibliographic data, 
including the punctuation, to the record. MARC needs the punctuation to be entered as part of 
the coding process. 
 
It is easier to learn descriptive cataloging by transcribing the description manually first, then 
coding it. In the workplace however, catalogers usually transcribe the data directly into MARC 
format, and increasingly often key it straight into a computer. 
 
MARC Codes 
MARC codes are provided at the back of the book. Refer to them for each content designator and 
each element until you become familiar with the most common ones. 
 
 
EXERCISE 7.2  
</p>
<p>Using your corrected descriptions, code them into MARC format. 
 
Here is an example:

</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>Note 
In MARC, the subfield code consists of two parts, the delimiter and the data element identifier, 
e.g., $a. The subfield code comes before each data element and after the relevant punctuation. 
There are no spaces between the punctuation, the subfield code and the data. </p>

DESCRIPTION OF CONTINUING RESOURCES 
(CatSkill - modules 7-14) 
 
 
Introduction 
Chapter 12 has a new name (Continuing Resources) and a broader scope than previously, when it 
dealt only with serials. A continuing resource is defined as &ldquo;A bibliographic resource that is issued 
over time with no predetermined conclusion. Continuing resources include serials and ongoing 
integrating resources.&rdquo; Appendix D&mdash;Glossary, AACR2 
 
A serial is defined as &ldquo;A continuing resource issued in a succession of discrete parts, usually 
bearing numbering, that has no predetermined conclusion. Examples of serials include journals, 
magazines, electronic journals, continuing directories, annual reports, newspapers, and 
monographic series.&rdquo; Appendix D&mdash;Glossary, AACR2 
 
An integrating resource is defined as &ldquo;A bibliographic resource that is added to or changed by 
means of updates that do not remain discrete and are integrated into the whole. Examples of 
integrating resources include updating loose-leafs and updating Web sites.&rdquo; Appendix D&mdash;
Glossary, AACR2 
 
Most of the substantive rules in Chapter 12 now have two sections&mdash;one for serials and one for 
integrating resources. Rules that do not have separate sections apply to both categories. 
 
These rules can also be applied to some works that are not intended to continue indefinitely, but 
have some of the same characteristics&mdash;e.g., the newsletters of a conference, reprints of serials. 
 
Serials are still the most common category for beginning catalogers, and this chapter focuses on 
describing serials.  
 
There is also a brief section about describing integrating resources. This area of bibliographic 
description is still evolving, and catalogers of electronic material in general, and updating websites 
in particular, need to keep up to date via catalogers&rsquo; email lists, talking with their cataloging 
colleagues and the professional literature on the topic. 
 
 </p>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Serials 
Much of the description of serials is the same as the description of monographs.   
 
The most important difference is that, when we catalog a serial, we catalog the complete serial&mdash;
that is, all the issues of the serial. In all other cases we catalogue the item in hand. 
 
 
The Complete Serial 
When a serial is catalogued, all the issues are treated as a single item. This changes our approach 
to three parts of the record in particular: 
&bull; the designation  
&bull; the date of publication 
&bull; the extent of the item. 
 
Designation 
This statement in area 3 is essential for serials, since the numbering is shown here. If the serial is 
still being published, this area gives the designation of the first issue, followed by a hyphen and 
four spaces, to show that it is still &lsquo;alive&rsquo;, 
e.g., Vol. 1, no. 1 (Jan. 1988)-     
 
If you are not cataloguing from the first issue, but have taken the numbering of the first issue 
from elsewhere (e.g., Ulrich&rsquo;s periodicals directory), use square brackets, 
e.g., [Vol. 1, no. 1 (Jan. 1988)]- 
 
Dates of  Publication 
The dates of publication of a serial are the date of the first issue to the date of the last issue. It is 
now an option not to include the date(s) if you do not have the first and/or last issue, and the 
dates cannot be readily identified. Until the serial ceases, the date (i.e., year) of publication is also 
left open by using a hyphen and four spaces, 
e.g., 1985-      
 
Extent of  Item 
In the physical description area, the first element for a monograph is the number of pages or 
volumes. In a serial, we must give the number of volumes in the complete serial. If the serial is 
still being published, this element will also be left open, since we do not know how many 
volumes the complete serial will have, 
e.g.,     v. 
 
When a Serial Ceases 
When a serial ceases, the numbering system and the date of publication are closed off by the 
numbering and date of the last issue, and the total number of volumes is filled in,  
e.g., Vol. 1, no. 1 (Jan. 1988)-Vol. 9, no. 12 (Dec. 2005) 
 1988-2005 
 18 v. 
 
Change of Title 
When a change of title or other major change occurs, a new entry may be created.

</p>

</p>
<p>Rules for Description of Serials 
Chapters 1 and 12 of AACR2 are used together for describing serials (and other continuing 
resources). If a serial is in a form other than print&mdash;e.g., a serial videorecording&mdash;the chapters 
dealing with both formats must be consulted, as well as the general rules in Chapter 1.

<p>EXERCISE 8.2  
This chapter contains the information needed to describe a number of serials. They cover a range of 
material, but cannot include every feature of every serial in a library. Get as much practice as you can 
on different titles, especially if someone can check your descriptions.  
 
Begin by consulting the rules on sources of information. Taking the information from the correct place 
is your first step. 
 
Work through each area of the description, and, until you become familiar with the most common 
rules, check AACR2 frequently. Look up specific rules as you need them, but you can also learn from 
browsing, especially among the AACR2 examples.  
</p>

<p>Integrating Resources 
An integrating resource is a work that is actively updated, whose parts do not remain separate. 
The updates are integrated into the whole, to produce a new, different work. 
 
Each instance of an integrating resource is called an iteration, whether as it is first published, or 
after it has been updated. 
 
Chapter 12 applies particularly to three types of ongoing integrated resources:  
</p>
<p>&bull; updating loose-leafs 
&bull; updating databases 
&bull; updating websites. 
</p>
<p> 
Updating Loose-leaf 
This is a base volume or volumes updated by adding, removing and/or substituting separate 
pages. 
 
Updating Database 
This is a collection of logically interrelated data stored together in one or more computerized 
files, usually created and managed by a database management system. An updating database may 
be a website or another form of electronic collection (on an intranet, as a stand-alone, etc.). 
 
Updating Website 
This is a website that is updated, but does not fit into one of the other categories of ongoing 
integrated resources.  
 
Catalog Record 
In general, an integrating resource has only one bibliographic record, which is updated to reflect 
changes in the resource. This is a departure for AACR, and requires ongoing attention to the 
original record, rather than the general practice of making a new record when anything about the 
work changes significantly.  
 
For changes in the title proper, change the title to reflect the current iteration and, in general, 
give the earlier title in a note. For changes in the statement of responsibility, use the latest format, 
and give the earlier responsible bodies in a note or notes. 
 
New bibliographic records are only created for particular changes resulting from mergers or splits, 
or when there is a new work, e.g., a complete replacement of the base volume of an updating 
loose-leaf. 
 
Unlike a serial, the description of an integrating resource is taken from its most recent iteration. 
 
Numbering 
Numbering is not generally used in integrating resources. 
 
Dates of  Publication 
Include the dates of the first and last iterations of the resource if they are available. It is an option 
not to include the date(s) if you do not have the first and/or last iteration(s), and the dates cannot 
be readily identified.  Alternatively, you can give information about dates for items not in hand 
(if they can be readily ascertained) in a note. This will depend on the library&rsquo;s policy.  </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Rules for Description of Integrating Resources 
Chapters 1 and 12 of AACR2 are used together for describing integrating resources. If a resource 
is in a format other than print (e.g, a website), the chapter dealing with that format (e.g., 
electronic resources) must also be consulted, as well as the general rules in Chapter 1. 
 
 
 
EXERCISE 8.4  
</p>
<p>Read the rules in Chapter 12 that relate to integrating resources. Begin by consulting the rules on 
sources of information.   
 
Work through each area of the description of the following items, checking AACR2 frequently. Look 
up specific rules as you need them, but you can also learn from browsing, especially among the 
AACR2 examples.

<p>Chapter 9 
DESCRIPTION OF NONBOOK M ATERIALS 
(CatSkill&mdash;modules 7-14) 
 
 
Introduction 
Most of the description of nonbook materials is the same as for monographs and serials. The 
major differences are in the material specific details, physical description and notes. 
 
 
Material Specific Details 
Three types of nonbook materials use area 3, the area containing details specific to a particular 
material type: 
&bull; cartographic materials&mdash;mathematical data (scale, projection and, optionally, coordinates 
</p>
<p>and equinox) 
&bull; printed music&mdash;musical presentation statement (optional area) 
&bull; computer files&mdash;file characteristics (data or program, number of records). 
 
Microform records also use this area if it is part of the original record. For example, a microfilm 
of a serial includes the designation(s) of the original serial. 
 
 
Physical Description 
The physical description is different for each kind of material. You need to consult the chapter 
for the particular material type, especially the examples given in AACR2. 
 
 
Notes 
Notes are used extensively for many nonbook items, to record all the extra information not 
included in the rest of the description. This includes cast and credits of sound and 
videorecordings, system requirements of computer software and much other vital data.

<p>EXERCISE 9.1  
This chapter contains the information needed to describe a number of nonbook items. They cover a 
range of material, but cannot include every feature of every nonbook item in a library. Get as much 
practice as you can on different titles, especially if someone can check your descriptions. 
Begin by consulting the rules on sources of information. Taking the information from the correct place 
is your first step. 
Work through each area of the description, and, until you become familiar with the most common 
rules, check AACR2 frequently. Look up specific rules as you need them, but you can also learn from 
browsing, especially among the AACR2 examples.

ACCESS POINTS 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 15) 
 
 
Introduction 
An access point is a name or term under which we find a bibliographic record in a catalog. 
 
Access points include main and added entries. Each record has one main entry. All other access 
points are added entries. A record can have many added entries, using as many terms as library 
users may need to find the record in the catalog. 
 
The words or phrases that provide access are called headings. This derives from the fact that they 
are written at the top (head) of the ISBD in traditional catalog records. 
 
 
Establishing Access Points 
In establishing access points, there are two main steps to take: 
&bull; selection of access points, one of which will be the main entry and others will be added entries  
&bull; identification of the form of heading to be used in the catalog, listing, bibliography, or 
</p>
<p>Kardex&reg;. 
 
 
</p>
<p>AACR2&mdash;Part II  
Part II of AACR2 gives all the rules for determining these two steps: 
 
Chapter 21 - selecting access points and determining the main entry and added entry headings 
 
Chapter 22 - the form of heading used for personal names 
 
Chapter 23 - the form of heading used for geographic names and place names 
 
Chapter 24 - the form of heading used for corporate bodies 
 
Chapter 25 - whether a uniform title should be added and how to format it 
 
Chapter 26 - the references catalog users need to find the headings chosen by the catalogers. 
 
</p>
<p> 
Intellectual and Artistic Responsibility 
In the description of items, we transcribe statements of responsibility that identify persons 
responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of an item. 
 
If a person writes a book, he or she is responsible for the intellectual content. If a person 
composes a piece of music, he or she is responsible for the artistic content. Sometimes it is 
difficult to distinguish between intellectual and artistic content of an item. Fortunately we don&rsquo;t 
have to, since the rules group them together.

<p> 
</p>
<p>Condition of Authorship 
These are the types of responsibility that exist in a work. For each type, AACR2 has rules to 
determine main and added entry headings: 
&bull; Single personal responsibility 
</p>
<p>- personal authorship 
- communication by a person in an official position 
</p>
<p>(official communication) 
&bull; Single corporate responsibility 
&bull; Multiple personal responsibility 
</p>
<p>- shared responsibility 
- mixed responsibility 
</p>
<p>&bull; Multiple corporate responsibility 
- shared responsibility 
- mixed responsibility 
</p>
<p>&bull; Collections and works produced under editorial direction 
- with a collective title 
- without a collective title 
</p>
<p>&bull; Unknown, unnamed, uncertain responsibility 
&bull; Wrongly attributed responsibility. 
 
 
Shared Responsibility 
Two or more persons or bodies performing the same function&mdash;that is, writing together, editing 
together, illustrating together and so on&mdash;have shared responsibility.

<p> 
 
Mixed Responsibility 
A work of mixed responsibility is one to which different persons or bodies make intellectual or 
artistic contributions by performing different functions, e.g., writing, editing, illustrating. For 
example, if one person writes an item and another person edits or illustrates it, the item is 
considered to be a work of mixed responsibility.

</p>
<p>Personal Authorship 
Rule 21.1A1 states: 
</p>
<p>A personal author is the person chiefly responsible for the creation of the intellectual or 
artistic content of a work. 
 
</p>
<p>Rule 21.1A2 states: 
Enter* a work by one or more persons under the heading for the personal author ..., the 
principal personal author ..., or the probable personal author ... 
 
</p>
<p>* (In AACR2, enter ... under the heading means that we give the main entry to ... )  
 
 
</p>
<p>So, if a work has a single personal author, the main entry heading is the heading for that person. 
If a work has two or three personal authors, of whom one is the principal author, the main entry 
heading is the heading for the principal author. 
 
 
Two or Three Persons or Bodies  
Rule 21.6C1 states: 
</p>
<p>If responsibility is shared between two or three persons or bodies and principal 
responsibility is not attributed to any of them by wording or layout, enter under the 
heading for the one named first. Make added entries under the headings for the others. 
 
</p>
<p>So, if a work has two or three personal authors, none of whom is the principal author, the main 
entry heading is the heading for the first named author. 
 
 
More than Three Authors 
Rule 21.6C2 states: 
</p>
<p>If responsibility is shared among more than three persons or bodies and principal 
responsibility is not attributed to any ..., enter under title. Make an added entry under the 
heading for the first person or corporate body named. 
 
</p>
<p>So if a work has more than three personal authors, the main entry heading is the heading for the 
title. 
 
 
Editorial Direction 
Rule 21.7 states that if a work is produced under editorial direction, the main entry heading is the 
heading for the title. 
 
 
Intellectual Responsibility? 
However, sometimes an editor or compiler is responsible for the intellectual content of a work. A 
compiler of a glossary of terms, for example, has created the work by his or her own intellectual 
effort, and therefore heads the main entry.

<p>Rules for Main Entry of Works of Personal Authorship 
Rule 21.1A2 states: 
</p>
<p>Enter a work by one or more persons under the heading for: 
 the personal author (21.4A) 
 the principal personal author (21.6B) 
 the probable personal author (21.5B). 
 
In some cases of 
 shared personal authorship (21.6) and 
 mixed personal authorship (21.8-21.27), 
enter under the heading for the person named first.

<p>Modifications 
AACR2 also has rules for works of mixed responsibility where works have been modified. 
Examples include a poem that has been translated, an adult novel that has been adapted for 
children, a piece of music differently arranged. 
 
Rule 21.9A states: 
</p>
<p>Enter a work that is a modification of another under the heading appropriate to the new 
work if the modification has substantially changed the nature and content of the original 
or if the medium of expression has been changed. If, however, the modification is an 
abridgement, rearrangement, etc., enter under the heading appropriate to the original ... 
</p>
<p> 
 
Adaptations for Children 
Rule 21.10A states: 
</p>
<p>Enter a paraphrase, ... adaptation for children ... under the heading for the adapter. If the 
adapter is unknown, enter under title.

When a work has been revised, the main entry depends on whether or not the original author is 
still considered responsible for the work.

Name-Title Added Entries 
A name-title added entry heading consists of the name of a person or corporate body and the title 
of an item. It is made when the work being cataloged is related to another work, and we want 
users to find the author and title of the other work together as a heading, 
 e.g., Irving, Washington, 1783-1859. The Alhambra

Works with a Collective Tit le 
Rule 21.7B1 refers to works that are contributed to by different persons or bodies, and which 
have a collective title. 
 
It states: 
</p>
<p>Enter a work ... under its title if it has a collective title. Make added entries under the 
headings for the compilers/editors if there are not more than three and if they are named 
prominently in the item being cataloged.

 or its internal policies, procedures, finances, and/or operations 
 or its officers, staff, and/or membership (e.g., directories) 
 or its resources (e.g., catalogs, inventories)

<p>Rule 21.1B2 (c) assumes that the relevant members of the corporate body have all agreed to the 
content of the item. That is, the item expresses the opinion of the body, not just the opinions 
they have collected together from others. 
 
In Rule 21.1B2 (d), note that the conference itself is the corporate body. 
 
Rule 21.1B2 (e) applies to a performing group that is actually engaged in creating the work as it 
is performed. This is very unusual. 
 
Rule 21.1B2 (f) is most often applied to maps in which a corporate body, for example a 
cartographic division of a larger body, has drawn and produced the map(s).

Title Main Entry 
A record has a title main entry if:  
&bull; its author is unknown 
&bull; it has more than three authors 
&bull; it emanates from a corporate body, but does not fit into 21.1B2 
&bull; it is produced under editorial direction 
&bull; it is a sacred scripture. 
 
Rule 21.1C lists these reasons. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>Uniform Title 
In the case of sacred scriptures, a special title known as a uniform title will sometimes be used. 
This is a special title added by the cataloger to: 
(a) distinguish between works with identical titles; 
(b) collocate identical works that have different titles; 
(c) subarrange works of voluminous authors. 
</p>
<p> 
Uniform titles are treated in Chapter 16 of this book, Chapter 25 of AACR2 and module 21 of 
CatSkill. 
 
 
Does It Matter? 
When catalog entries were written or typed one at a time, the main entry contained all the 
necessary information. Added entries could then be shortened, to save work. When catalog 
entries are all reproduced mechanically, each entry contains the same information, except for the 
heading. 
 
Automated catalogs allow users to find records from a large number of access points. In many 
catalogs, it no longer matters which is the main and which are the added entries.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Sometimes It Matters 
When a manual catalog has only one full entry, which is found by the use of indexes, it is useful 
to know which it is likely to be. 
 
For example, many bibliographies, including national bibliographies, have one main classified 
sequence with complete catalog entries. Access to these complete entries is by looking up an 
author index, a title index or a subject index. 
 
 
Added Entries 
Added entries are made to enable users to find an item, and to bring related materials together in 
the catalog. 
 
Added entries can be 
&bull; names of persons 
&bull; names of corporate bodies 
&bull; titles 
&bull; series 
&bull; name/title access points (for related works). 
</p>
<p> 
Chapter 21 tells us which added entries to make. Chapters 22-25 tells us how to set up the 
particular form of the headings. 
 
 
Rules for Added Entries 
Rule 21.29 encourages us to make as many added entries as are necessary to provide access to the 
records in the catalog, &ldquo;in the context of a given catalog&rdquo;.  
 
Rule 21.30 give specific rules for added entries: 
&bull; 2 or more persons or bodies involved (21.30A) 
&bull; collaborators (21.30B) 
&bull; writers (21.30C) 
&bull; editors and compilers (21.30D) 
&bull; corporate bodies (21.30E) 
&bull; other related persons or bodies (21.30F) 
&bull; related works (21.30G) 
&bull; other relationships (21.30H) 
&bull; titles (21.30J) 
&bull; translators (21.30K1) 
&bull; illustrators (21.30K2) 
&bull; series (21.30L) 
&bull; analytical entries (21.30M). 
 
You will need to consult the specific rules, particularly for the special cases: 
&bull; translators (21.30K1) 
&bull; illustrators (21.30K2) 
&bull; series (21.30L) 
&bull; analytical entries (21.30M).

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Changes in Title Proper (21.2)  
Sometimes very similar works are published and it becomes necessary to inspect the title very 
closely in order to identify the differences. The rules aim to keep cataloging of new materials to a 
minimum, so similar material can be treated as copies rather than new items. 
 
Check Rule 21.2A if you think you are cataloging a work with a change of title proper. 
 
If you do not consider the title to have changed, give details in a note, and make an added entry 
for any variant titles needed for access. 
 
When a monograph appears in a different edition, regardless of title, a new record is always 
created.

<p>Chapter 11 
AUTHORITY CONTROL AND REFERENCES 
(CatSkill&mdash;modules 16 &amp; 22) 
 
 
Authority Control 
Authority control is the maintenance of standard forms of headings in the catalog, so that library 
users can locate information using consistent subject, name and title headings. 
 
Some libraries record the standard forms of headings in an authority file, so that catalogers can 
refer to them, and not have to re-create them or look them up again. References made to and 
from the headings are also recorded here. Other libraries rely on the standardized headings 
available in their automated system. In either case, it is important to appreciate the need for 
standardized headings and the procedures required to establish and make use of them. 
  
There are four types of authority records: Name, Subject, Series, and Uniform title. Name 
authority files generally include uniform titles. 
 
Establishing the authority records involves the use of AACR2 rules to decide on the correct form 
of the heading. It may also require reference sources to find dates of birth or full names. 
 
 
Authority Files 
There are several large authority files to which catalogers refer. The organizations that create them 
use AACR2 rules and have access to additional information needed to establish the heading. 
 
The main authority file for descriptive cataloging is Library of Congress Authorities (LCA), 
available online at authorities.loc.gov. The headings are free to download in MARC format for 
use in a local library system. 
 
If a library maintains its own authority file, it establishes authoritative headings using Library of 
Congress Authorities and other specialist authority files. It may add extra references, depending on 
the needs of its users. 
 
 
References 
A reference is a direction or signpost in the catalog from one heading to another, so that clients 
can find all related entries. 
 
When we have a standard heading, we refer users to this heading from other headings that they 
may look up. Many library systems do this automatically, and users may be unaware that the 
terms they enter are not the preferred terms. Other systems show the correct headings, but users 
must select them to find the items they want. Where necessary, directions are provided in the 
catalog, pointing from unused headings to the headings that are used. Directions are also given to 
and from related items to link them together. 
 
In all systems, the cataloger decides on the preferred heading(s), and enters the information into 
the system. This chapter treats references as if the cataloger needs to create them.

<p>Chapter 26 
Comprehensive rules for references are contained in Chapter 26 of AACR2. 
 
In general, we make a reference under any heading a catalog user may reasonably expect to find. 
We must ensure that for every reference, there is an item in the catalog under the heading being 
used. That is, we must not direct catalog users to an empty space. 
 
Libraries have traditionally needed to keep a record of all references made, so that they can be 
corrected or deleted. A library&rsquo;s own authority file fulfils this purpose. Increasingly, this control is 
incorporated into the operation of automated library systems. 
 
 
Authority Records 
The availability of authority records, and their precise format, is changing with developments in 
library systems. However, the principles of establishing standard forms of headings and enabling 
catalog users to find what they are looking for remain unchanged. 
 
Here are some examples of authority records. 
 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AUTHORITIES (DECEMBER 2006) 
</p>
<p> 
Here are the results of searching for the preferred heading for J. K. Galbraith: 
 
 HEADING:   Galbraith, John Kenneth, 1908-2006 
 Used For/See From:  Galbraith, J. K. ( John Kenneth), 1908-2006 
   Chia-erh-pu-lei-ssu, 1908-2006  
   Ge.lbrei˘t, Dzhon Kennet, 1908-2006 
   Ge.lbrei˘t, Dzh. K. (Dzhon Kennet), 1908-2006 
     Gha&macr;lbrayt, Ju&macr;n Kini&macr;t, 1908-2006 
 
So, Galbraith, John Kenneth, 1908-2006 is the heading we need. 
 
Library of Congress Authorities provides the preferred headings for a very large number of names. 
Since many names are identical, records also provide one or more sources of information by 
which searchers can identify the person they want. In this record for Mary Robinson, former 
president of Ireland, several sources of information are given. One is a biography by F. Finlay, 
which establishes that this is the former Irish president. Another is a reference work used to verify 
her date of birth.

</p>
<p>EXERCISE 11.1 
In LCA or another online authority file, enter your own name or the name of an author. Make sure you 
can identify the preferred heading, and see if there are any other forms of the name that refer you to 
the preferred form.  
 
Name: 
 
 
Preferred form of heading: 
 
 
Other (non-preferred) forms of name: 
 
 
 
</p>
<p> 
 
 
See Reference 
A see reference directs the user from the form of a heading that is not used to a form of heading 
that is used. 
 
Non-Preferred Form 
When we have decided on one form of a name to be used as the standard heading, we need to 
refer the user to this heading from all the other headings they might reasonably look up. 
 
Although Malcolm X&rsquo;s books are all published under this later name, users may look up his 
earlier name, Malcolm Little. So we make a see reference that will direct them to our preferred 
heading: 
</p>
<p>Little, Malcolm 
see  
X, Malcolm 
</p>
<p> 
Change of Name 
The folksinger and songwriter changed his name from Bob Camp to Hamilton Camp. 
 
Our heading will therefore be: Camp, Hamilton 
 
If the library changes all its headings to Camp, Hamilton, the reference will be: 
</p>
<p>Camp, Bob 
see 
Camp, Hamilton 
 
</p>
<p>If the library has too many records with the heading Camp, Bob, they may choose to change to 
the new heading for new items, but for the older records make a reference: 
</p>
<p>Camp, Bob 
see also 
Camp, Hamilton 
 
</p>
<p>In this case, they would also need the reference: 
Camp, Hamilton 
see also 
Camp, Bob </p>
<p/>

<p> 
</p>
<p>Different Entry Element 
The preferred heading for Simone de Beauvoir is Beauvoir, Simone de, 1908-1986. However, 
catalog users might reasonably look up De Beauvoir, Simone. 
 
The reference will look like this: 
</p>
<p>De Beauvoir, Simone, 1908-1986 
see 
Beauvoir, Simone de, 1908-1986 
</p>
<p> 
 
See Also Reference 
A see also reference directs the catalog user to a related entry or name. It is normally used when a 
person or corporate body is entered under two or more different names. 
 
More than One Name 
Many writers use more than one name for different types of writing. The academic Carolyn 
Heilbrun writes detective fiction under the pseudonym Amanda Cross. To link these names in 
the catalog, we use see also references. For example, 
</p>
<p>Heilbrun, Carolyn 
see also 
Cross, Amanda 
 
and 
 
Cross, Amanda 
see also 
Heilbrun, Carolyn 
 
</p>
<p> 
Change of Name of Corporate Body 
Corporate bodies frequently change their names. In an authority file all the names are recorded, 
together with relevant information about how they are used and when changes have occurred. 
 
When a corporate body changes its name, we link the names with see also references.  
 
Here are the see also references for one name change. If the body changes its name more than 
once, references are also made, provided there is a record that uses each of the names. Remember 
not to send users to headings if there is no record when they get there!  
 
Association of Young People&rsquo;s Librarians (U.S.) 
</p>

 Eliza Bryant Home for the Aged (Cleveland, Ohio) 
 
Eliza Bryant Home for the Aged (Cleveland, Ohio) 
  search also under the earlier heading  
 Cleveland Home for Aged Colored People (Cleveland, Ohio) 
 
 
Explanatory Reference 
An explanatory reference provides more detailed guidance than is given in a see or see also 
reference. For example: 
 
Zambia. President (1964-1991 : Kaunda) 
</p>
<p>Here are entered works by the President acting in his official  
capacity. For works by the President acting as an individual   
</p>
<p>  see also 
  Kaunda, Kenneth D. (Kenneth David), 1924- 
</p>
<p> 
Many explanatory references are found in major authority files. Others are created by individual 
libraries to explain particular cataloging usage and practices. 
 
Preferred Heading 
A preferred heading is recorded together with the non-preferred headings for which references 
have been made. The non-preferred headings are marked with Used For or See From.  
For example, 
 
HEADING:  IFLA Office for International Lending. 
Used For/See From:  International Federation of Library Associations. Office for International 
</p>
<p>Lending    
 
</p>
<p>That is, use the heading   IFLA Office for International Lending 
 
and make a see reference from: 
International Federation of Library Associations. Office for International Lending. 
 
We also record the reference  
 
</p>

<p>Series Authority Files 
A series authority file records every series represented in the catalog, and may indicate whether an 
added entry is made for the series (i.e., whether the series is traced). It may also indicate whether 
any references are required and if works in a series are classified together (at a common call 
number) or classified separately. 
 
An entry should be made for every new series recording the decisions made.

HEADINGS FOR PERSONS 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 17) 
 
 
Introduction 
AACR2 provides rules to establish headings for persons in the catalog, so that library users can 
locate these names using consistent headings. When users search for a particular person, they 
need to be able to find all other works by this person under the same form of his or her name. 
 
If authors have published other works under different forms of their name, the catalog can link 
the works together by using the same heading and references from other forms of the name. 
 
 
Chapter 22 
The rules for headings for persons are contained in Chapter 22 of AACR2. A brief summary of 
the most important rules is included here. You will need to consult the rules themselves for details 
and examples. 
 
First, we must decide on the name to be used. 
 
Second, we need to establish the entry element&mdash;that is, the part of the name under which the 
name will be found in the catalog. 
 
 
Choice of Name (22.1)  
Choose the name most frequently used by the person. It may be: 
- real name  
- pseudonym 
- title of nobility 
- nickname 
- initials 
- including accents and hyphens 
or something else. 
 
It is usually the name that appears on the chief source of information (title page, etc.) of works by 
the person. 
 
 
Predominant Name (22.2A)  
If a person is known by more than one name, choose the name by which the person is clearly 
more commonly known. 
 
Check the authority file to verify the heading. 
 
 Galbraith, John Kenneth  not  Galbraith, J. K.  or  Galbraith, (J. K.) John Kenneth </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>146     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Separate Identities (22.2B2)  
Sometimes the same person has written different kinds of works under different names. Each 
name is used with the work it relates to. 
 
 Cross, Amanda, 1926-. The puzzled heart (detective fiction)   These are the 
 Heilbrun, Carolyn G., 1926-. The education of a woman (biography) same person 
 
 
Change of Name (22.2C)  
Choose the latest form of name unless there is reason to believe the earlier name will persist. 
 
 Muhammad Ali  not  Cassius Clay 
 
 
Entry Element (22.4)  
This is the part of the name under which the name will be found in the catalog. 
  
 Bronte, Charlotte  not  Charlotte Bronte 
 
 
Use the Surname (22.5)  
Use the surname if there is one. 
 
If the first element is a surname, follow it by a comma. If the surname is not first, turn the name 
around so that the surname is the first element. Follow it by a comma. 
 
 Mao, Tse-tung 
 Walker, Alice 
 
 
Compound Surnames (22.5C)  
A compound surname consists of two or more proper names, sometimes connected by a hyphen, 
a conjunction and/or a preposition. 
 
</p>
<p>David Lloyd George 
Henrietta Drake-Brockman 
Vincent van Gogh 
Daphne du Maurier 
Georg Ludwig von und zu Urff 
</p>
<p> 
In general, use the element preferred by the person bearing the name. If this is not known, use 
the element preferred in reference sources in the person&rsquo;s language or country of residence. 
 
 Lloyd George, David 
 
If the surname is hyphenated, enter under the first element.  
 
 Drake-Brockman, Henrietta 
If it is not hyphenated, check Rules 22.5C4-22.5C5. If you are not sure that it is a compound 
surname, check Rule 22.5C6. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>   Chapter 12     HEADINGS FOR PERSONS     147 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>If the name has one or more separately written prefixes&mdash;e.g., articles and prepositions or a 
combination of the two&mdash;check the language groupings in Rule 22.5D1, since the practice is 
different in different languages.  
 
 Musset, Alfred de (French) 
 Du Maurier, Daphne (English) 
 
 
Other Forms 
Chapter 22 gives rules for the headings of many other kinds of names. They include: 
 Entry under title of nobility 
 Entry under given name 
 Entry under initials, letters, or numerals 
 Entry under phrase. 
 
 
Additions to Names 
Chapter 22 contains detailed rules about additions to names, for example: 
 Titles of nobility 
 British terms of honor 
 Saints 
 Spirits 
 Additions to surname only 
 Royalty 
 Popes 
 Bishops 
 Other persons of religious vocation. 
 
 
Distinguishing Identical Names 
There are several rules for distinguishing names that are or might be identical. They include the 
addition of a person&rsquo;s full name and dates of birth and death. This is the practice followed by the 
major cataloging agencies and networks. 
 
When a library catalog uses the headings established in one of the major name authority files, it 
makes use of this provision in the rules. 
 
 
Dates (22.17)  
The dates normally used are the date of birth and, where the person is no longer living, the date 
of death. 
 
 Browne, John, 1642-ca. 1700 
 Browne, John, 1696-1750 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>148     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>It is an option to add date(s) to all personal names, even if it is not necessary to distinguish 
between headings. 
 
</p>
<p>Shakespeare, William, 1554-1616 
 
If these dates cannot be established, Rule 22.17A gives examples of other dates that can be used. 
 
 Browne, John, b. 1668 or 9 
 Browne, John, fl. 1777-1798 
 
 
Fuller Forms (22.18)  
If a fuller form of a person&rsquo;s name is known, and the person does not commonly use the fuller 
form, add the fuller form to distinguish between headings that are otherwise identical. 
 
 Johnston, J. A. (John Anthony) 
 Johnston, J. A. (Judith A.) 
 
 
Distinguishing Terms (22.19)  
Rule 22.19 lists some other terms that can be used to distinguish between identical headings. 
 
 Johnson, Fred, 1916- 
 Johnson, Fred, vocalist 
 
 
Certain Languages 
Rules 22.21 through 22.28 treat in more detail names not written in the roman alphabet and 
names in non-European languages written in the roman alphabet. 
 
It would be wise to consult a name authority file if you need to establish any of these name 
headings. 
 
 
When in Doubt . ..  
Standard forms of name for headings are best established by using a large authority file. You are 
strongly advised always to check the forms of names used as headings in an authority file such as 
Library of Congress Authorities. 
 
 
In Summary 
&bull; Choose the most commonly used name (real, pseudonym, initials, etc.). 
&bull; Decide which part of the name comes first in the heading (entry element). 
&bull; Make the name distinct if necessary.

Title Added Entry 
A normal title added entry does not need additional coding, since it is already included in the 
description. The first indicator in the title field tells the computer whether or not to make a title 
added entry. 
 
 
Variant Title Added Entry 
A variant title is a title other than the title proper, by which the work is also known.  
 
 Adobe Photoshop  is also known as  Photoshop 
 
When a work needs an additional access point for the variant title, it will be coded using the 246 
</p>
<p>(Varying Form of Title) field. 
 
 
Name-Title Added Entry 
A name-title added entry is an added entry consisting of the name of a person or corporate body 
and the title of an item.  
 
When a MARC record includes a name-title added entry, it is coded using one of the fields 
</p>
<p>700 (Added Entry&mdash;Personal Name) 
710 (Added Entry&mdash;Corporate Name) 
 
</p>
<p>The title is coded in a subfield of this field. Automated systems pick up the title from this subfield 
and create another title access point.

GEOGRAPHIC NAMES AS HEADINGS 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 18) 
 
 
Introduction 
AACR2 provides rules for establishing standard geographic names in the catalog, so that library 
users can locate places and bodies using consistent headings. 
 
Many places have more than one form of name. A catalog needs a standard form of geographic 
name for each place. 
 
 
Chapter 23 
The rules for geographic names are contained in Chapter 23 of AACR2. 
 
Geographic names are used: 
&bull; to distinguish between corporate bodies with the same name 
&bull; as additions to other corporate names 
&bull; as the names of governments and communities that are not governments. 
 
 
General Rule (23.2)  
The general rule is to use the English form if it is commonly used. Reference sources may be 
needed to decide the common English form. Where there is no English name in general use, use 
the official name of the place. If there is more than one official name, the English name is 
preferred. 
 
As with other names, it is always best to verify a geographic name in a name authority file. The 
Library of Congress has preferences for certain names, e.g., Great Britain (not United Kingdom), 
United States (not United States of America). 
 
 
Changes of Name (23.3)  
If the name of a place changes, we use each name to refer to the place at the time a particular 
name was used. 
 
 
Additions to Names (23.4)  
In general, the rules aim to: 
&bull; identify a place by using the name of a larger place 
&bull; distinguish between two or more places with the same name. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>156     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Chapter 23 details the additions for particular regions, including Australia, Canada, Malaysia, the 
United States, the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, and the British Isles. Although the U.S.S.R. and 
Yugoslavia are no longer political entities, the rules apply to earlier publications of those places. 
They also apply to current publications of the individual countries (previously republics). 
 
 
No Addition Needed 
The names of countries do not require any qualification. Nor do the parts of the British Isles: 
England, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, the 
Channel Islands. States, provinces, territories, etc., of Australia, Canada, Malaysia, the United 
States, the U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia also stand on their own.  
 
e.g., Scotland 
 Kansas 
 
 
Addition Needed 
Places within some states, territories and parts of the British Isles require qualification by the 
name of the larger area. Refer to Rules 23.4C through 23F. 
 
If the place is in a state, province, territory, etc., of Australia, Canada, Malaysia, the United 
States, the U.S.S.R., or Yugoslavia, add the name of the state, etc., in which it is located. 
 
e.g.,  Kansas City (Kan.) 
 Victoria (B.C.) 
 
 
If the place is in England, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of 
Man, or the Channel Islands, add England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Isle of 
Man, or Channel Islands. 
 
e.g.,  Strathclyde (Scotland) 
 Jersey (Channel Islands)

HEADINGS FOR CORPOR ATE BODIES 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 19) 
 
 
Introduction 
AACR2 provides rules for establishing headings for corporate bodies in the catalog, so that users 
can locate these names using consistent headings. It is important to establish standard forms of 
name for corporate bodies, so that there is a consistent access point for each body. 
 
References can be made from other forms of the name. 
 
 
Chapter 24 
The rules for headings for corporate bodies are contained in Chapter 24 of AACR2. A brief 
summary of the most important rules is included here. You will need to consult the rules 
themselves for details and examples. 
 
 
Direct Name (24.1A)  
Choose the name by which the corporate body is commonly identified. 
 
Enter the body directly under its own name if: 
&bull; the body is known under that name 
&bull; it does not need the name of another body or government to identify it. 
 
</p>
<p>Center for Technology Transfer &amp; Pollution Prevention 
 
 
Change of Name (24.1C)  
Corporate bodies often change their names.  
 
Make a new heading under the new name for items appearing under that name. Use the form in 
use at the time of publication of the work. Make references from the old heading to the new and 
from the new heading to the old, provided you have works under both headings. 
 
 
Variant Names (24.2)  
Sometimes corporate bodies use more than one form of their name. 
 
Choose the form of name in the chief sources of information. If this varies, choose the name that 
is presented formally. If no name is presented formally, or if all names are presented formally, use 
the predominant form of name. 
 
If there is no predominant form, use a brief form (including an initialism or acronym) that would 
differentiate the body from others with the same or similar brief names. Special rules for variant 
names are given in Rule 24.3. 
 
 </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>160     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Conventional Name (24.3C)  
Use the conventional name. 
 
</p>
<p>Westminster Abbey  not  Collegiate Church of St. Peter in Westminster 
 
 
Governments (24.3E)   
Use the conventional name of a government, unless the official name is in common use. The 
conventional name of a government is the geographic name of the area over which the 
government exercises jurisdiction. 
 
</p>
<p>Puerto Rico  not  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
 
 
Additions to the Name (24.4)  
In general, we make additions to the names of corporate bodies 
&bull; to convey the idea of a corporate body, or 
&bull; to distinguish between similar names, or 
&bull; to assist in understanding the nature or purpose of the body. 
 
</p>
<p>Mayflower (Ship) 
Mayflower (Ship : Replica) 
</p>
<p> 
 
Omissions (24.5)  
In general, omit initial articles and adjectival terms or abbreviations indicating incorporation. 
 
 Library Association  not  The Library Association 
  Events Unlimited  not  Events Unlimited Inc.    
 
 
Governments. Additions (24.6)  
Add terms to the names of governments that are otherwise the same.

j. The Australian newspaper 
 
 
 
</p>
<p> 
 
Subordinate Bodies (24.12)  
If the name of a corporate body is distinctive, it is entered directly under its own name. However, 
there are some types of corporate bodies that can only be identified as part of a larger body. 
 
For example, a department or a branch is always part of a parent body, and can only be identified 
by including the name of the parent body. 
 
</p>
<p>University of Pittsburgh. Research Bureau for Retail Training

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>162     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Types of Subordinate Body (24.13)  
Rule 24.13 lists six types of subordinate body to be entered under the name of the parent body. 
They include names that imply administrative subordination, are general in nature, do not 
convey the idea of a corporate body or include the entire name of the higher or related body. 
 
 Daughters of the American Revolution. Columbus Chapter 
 
 
Subheadings 
Sometimes a corporate body is part of a larger body that is itself part of a still larger body. 
 
For example, the Audiovisual Committee is part of the Public Library Association, which is part 
of the American Library Association. However, the Public Library Association can be entered 
under its own name. 
 
So the heading is: 
</p>
<p>Public Library Association. Audiovisual Committee 
 
 
Omit Part of Hierarchy 
It is sometimes necessary only to include some of the corporate bodies in the hierarchy. 
 
Here is a hierarchy: 
</p>
<p>American Dietetic Association 
House of Delegates 
Committee on Association Membership 
</p>
<p> 
We need a heading for the Committee. 
 
Could we leave out the Committee on Association Membership? No, since this is the body for 
which we are making the heading. 
 
Could we leave out the House of Delegates? Yes, since the Committee on Association 
Membership is the only committee of this name in the American Dietetic Association, and 
therefore we do not need the House of Delegates to identify it. 
 
So our heading will be: 
</p>
<p>American Dietetic Association. Committee on Association Membership 
 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  Chapter 14     HEADINGS FOR CORPORATE BODIES     163 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>References 
When we omit part of a hierarchy, we need to make references from fuller headings that users 
might expect to find. 
 
Here is our original hierarchy: 
</p>
<p>American Dietetic Association 
House of Delegates 
Committee on Association Membership 
</p>
<p>And here is the hierarchy we have decided on: 
American Dietetic Association 
Committee on Association Membership 
</p>
<p> 
We make a see reference from 
</p>
<p>American Dietetic Association 
House of Delegates 
Committee on Association Membership 
</p>
<p> 
to  
</p>
<p>American Dietetic Association 
Committee on Association Membership 
</p>
<p> 
which looks like this: 
</p>
<p>American Dietetic Association. House of Delegates. Committee on Association 
Membership 
</p>
<p> see 
American Dietetic Association. Committee on Association Membership 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>Government Bodies (24.17)  
The same general principle applies to government bodies. If a body has a name that is distinctive 
and identifiable, enter it under its own name. 
 
</p>
<p>Appalachian Education Satellite Program 
 
Rule 24.17 gives a list of types of bodies that must include the name of the government that 
creates or controls them. They include names that imply administrative subordination, are 
general in nature, do not convey the idea of a corporate body and do not include the name of the 
government. 
 
They also include official arms of government:  
 - a ministry 
 - a legislative body 
 - a court 
 - a principal service of the armed forces 
 - a head of state or head of government 
 - an embassy, consulate, etc. 
 - a delegation to an international or intergovernmental body. 
 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>164     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Subheadings 
Again, we apply the same principle as for non-government bodies. In a hierarchy of subordinate 
bodies, leave out any that are not needed for identification of the body. 
 
Here is a hierarchy: 
</p>
<p>United States 
Dept. of Education 
Office of Elementary and Secondary Education 
</p>
<p>We need a heading for the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. 
 
We must retain the heading United States, since that is the name of the government. Is this 
(likely to be) the only Office of Elementary and Secondary Education in the government of the 
United States? 
 
Yes, it is, so we can omit Dept. of Education from the hierarchy, and still retain all the elements 
we need to identify our government body. 
 
Our heading is now: 
</p>
<p>United States. Office of Elementary and Secondary Education 
 
 
Special Rules 
Chapter 24 also contains rules for: 
</p>
<p>- government officials 
- legislative bodies 
- constitutional conventions 
- courts 
- armed forces 
- embassies, consulates, etc. 
- delegations to international and intergovernmental bodies 
- religious bodies and officials. 
</p>
<p> 
 
References 
When corporate bodies change their names, references must be made to and from the different 
forms of the names. References must also be made to and from variant forms of the name of a 
body.  
 
When one or more body is omitted from a hierarchy of subordinate bodies, references must be 
made from the fuller form of the heading. 
 
 
Name Authority File 
As with other names, the correct form of name for a corporate body should always be checked in 
a name authority file.

<p>MARC  
Corporate names are coded in the same way as personal names, by referring to the MARC codes 
at the back of the book (or the MARC manual if you have access to it). First you need to know 
whether the name is a main or an added entry, and then use the tag, indicators and subfield codes 
you need.

SERIES 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 20) 
 
 
Introduction 
A series is a collection of items that has a distinctive title although each item has its own 
individual title. Sometimes an item may be in more than one series. 
 
In descriptive cataloging (at level 2 or 3), each series title must be considered in two ways: 
&bull; for the description (Rule 1.6). This must be in exactly the form in which it appears in the item 
&bull; as an access point (Rule 21.30L). Does the library want this series to be an access point in its 
</p>
<p>catalog? Will readers use it as an access point? 
 
If in doubt, make an added entry for the series. 
 
Keep a record of all such decisions in a series authority file in order to keep entries consistent. 
 
 
Series Added Entries 
A series heading is the access point for the series. The series heading is usually the series title. If 
there are other series with the same title, extra information is added to distinguish them. 
 
A series heading is only added as an access point if it is likely that users will search for items in the 
series. The cataloger decides whether to make a series added entry. Series headings are listed in 
name authority files like Library of Congress Authorities. 
 
 
Types of Series 
There are three kinds of series: 
&bull; Series traced exactly as in the series statement 
</p>
<p>The world of folk dances 
&bull; Series traced differently from the series statement 
</p>
<p>Description: Cinema heritage series, ISSN 0816-5467 ; no. 8 
Access point: Cinema heritage series 
</p>
<p>&bull; Series not traced at all 
The modern library 
</p>
<p> 
 
Make a Series Added Entry? (21.30L1)   
Make an added entry under the heading for a series if you expect that a library user will look for 
the item in the catalog under the series heading. It is optional to add the number in the series; in 
practice, very few users would search for the item under the number in the series. 
 
In case of doubt make a series added entry.  </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>Series Authority File 
It is important to check the series authority file to: 
&bull; see if this series heading has been already established 
&bull; check the preferred form of the heading. 
 
</p>
<p> 
Numbered Series 
Sometimes we need to trace the same heading, but without other parts of the series statement 
such as series numbers or the ISSN. 
 
 
Not a Distinctive Series Tit le 
Many series have titles that are not distinctive. That is, there are some series with the same title. 
 
 Research paper 
 Technical monograph 
 
If a title like this becomes the series heading, users of the catalog will not know which series it is. 
 
In establishing these headings, make a uniform title for the series title. 
 
 
Series Uniform Titles (25.5B) 
For most series like this, add the name of the corporate body responsible for the series. It can also 
be the place of publication, or the date, or a combination, or other identifying information. 
 
 Technical paper (Minnesota Higher Education Coordinating Board) 
 Teach yourself books (Lincolnwood, Ill.) 
 
 
Series Statement Not Traced 
Sometimes the series statement is not traced as a series heading. This is when the cataloger 
decides that the series title is not useful to any library user, and therefore should not be added to 
the catalog record, even though it appears in the series statement as part of the description.

<p>MARC 
To enter the series information in MARC format, begin with the series statement. Look again at 
the MARC codes for series. In order to code the series statement, decide whether the series added 
entry is the same as or different from the series statement, or whether there will be a series added 
entry at all. 
 
If the series statement is the same as the series added entry, the coding is included in the 440 
field. The tag 440 tells the computer to make a series added entry in the same form as the series 
statement (except that some systems leave the number in the series and the ISSN out of the 
heading, even if they are present in the series statement). 
 
 440  0 $aLearning local history 
 
If there is no series added entry, the tag 490 and the first indicator 0 tell the computer not to 
make an added entry for the series. 
 
 490 0  $aPiccolo books   
 
If the series added entry is different from the series statement, an additional field &ndash;  
830 (Series Added Entry&mdash;Uniform Title) &ndash; is needed:

UNIFORM TITLES 
(CatSkill&mdash;module 21) 
 
 
Introduction  
There are two kinds of uniform titles, which serve apparently opposite purposes: 
&bull; for monographs, a uniform title brings together all the versions of a work, so that library users 
</p>
<p>can find all the versions under one heading 
e.g., Bible 
</p>
<p>&bull; for serials and series, a uniform title distinguishes between identical titles 
e.g., Monograph (Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station). 
 
</p>
<p>The use of uniform titles depends on the policy of the cataloging agency. Many libraries do not 
use uniform titles. 
 
Uniform title and name-title headings are included in name authority files. 
 
 
Uniform Titles for Monographs 
Use a uniform title for a monograph when: 
&bull; the work has appeared under different titles proper 
</p>
<p>e.g., Mark Twain&rsquo;s work The adventures of Huckleberry Finn is also issued under the title 
Huckleberry Finn 
</p>
<p>&bull; translations need to be kept together with the original work 
e.g., Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez&rsquo;s Love in the time of cholera is an English translation of Amor 
</p>
<p> en los tiempos del c&oacute;lera 
&bull; the title of the work is obscured by the wording of the title proper 
</p>
<p>e.g., Dickens&rsquo; Dealings with the firm of Dombey and son, wholesale, retail and for exportation is 
really Dombey and son. 
</p>
<p> 
 
Chapter 25 
The rules for uniform titles are contained in Chapter 25 of AACR2. A brief summary of the most 
important rules is included here. You will need to consult the rules themselves for details and 
examples. 
 
Use of a uniform title depends on: 
&bull; how well the work is known 
&bull; how many manifestations of the work are involved 
&bull; whether another work with the same title proper has been identified 
&bull; whether the main entry is under title 
&bull; whether the work was originally in another language 
&bull; the extent to which the catalog is used for research purposes. 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188     LEARN DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGING  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>General Rule  
In general, the best known English title of a work is chosen as the uniform title. It is usually 
enclosed in square brackets, and given before the title proper. 
</p>
<p> 
[Bible] 
</p>
<p> 
 
Translation (25.5C1)  
The uniform title includes the original title and the language of the item being cataloged. 
 
</p>
<p>[Amor en los tiempos del c&oacute;lera. English] 
 
 
Collective Ti tles 
25.8A. Use the collective title Works for an item that consists of ... the complete works of a 
person ... 
 
 Shakespeare, William, ....  
 [Works] 
 The complete works of Shakespeare 
 
25.9A. Use the collective title Selections for items consisting of three or more works in various 
forms, or in one form if the person created works in one form only, and for items consisting of 
extracts, etc., from the works of one person. 
 
 Whitman, Walt 
 [Selections] 
 Selections from Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson 
 
25.10A. Use one of the following collective titles for an item ... 
</p>
<p>Correspondence 
Essays 
Novels 
Plays 
Poems 
Prose works 
Short stories 
Speeches 
</p>
<p> 
 Whitman, Walt 
 [Selections] 
 Collected poetry 
 
 Whitman, Walt 
 [Poems. Selections] 
 Selections from Song of myself and other poems 
 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p> Chapter 16     UNIFORM TITLES     189 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Special Rules 
Chapter 25 gives details of certain types of work that use uniform titles. These include: 
</p>
<p>manuscripts 
laws 
treaties 
sacred scriptures 
liturgical works 
musical works. 
</p>
<p> 
If you need these uniform titles, refer to Chapter 25 or a name authority file. 
 
 
Works Entered under Title (25.2E1)  
If a work is entered under a uniform title, make an added entry under the title proper of the item 
being cataloged. 
 
For example, the book A thousand and one nights is entered under the uniform title Arabian 
nights. Therefore an added entry is given to the title proper A thousand and one nights. 
 
 
Works Entered under Name (25.2E2)  
If a work is entered under a personal or corporate heading and a uniform title is used, make an 
added entry under the title proper of the item being cataloged. 
 
For example, here is a book translated into German from English. Enter it under the personal 
name followed by the uniform title, and then the title proper. 
 
</p>
<p>Koch, C. J. (Christopher John), 1932- 
[Year of living dangerously. German].  
Ein Jahr in der H&ouml;lle 
 
 
</p>
<p>Make an added entry for the title proper, i.e., Ein Jahr in der H&ouml;lle. 
 
 
Check the Authority File 
As with other headings, check an authority file after you have constructed your heading according 
to the AACR2 rules.

<p>Uniform Titles for Serials 
Use a uniform title for a serial to distinguish it from another serial with the same title proper.  
 
For example, there are many serials called Bulletin or Newsletter. To identify each individual 
serial, a qualifier is added after the title proper. 
 Bulletin (Columbia Society of International Law) 
 Bulletin (Sydney, N.S.W.) 
 
 
Qualifiers 
25.5B. Add in parentheses an appropriate explanatory word, brief phrase, or other designation to 
distinguish a uniform title used as a heading ... from an identical or similar uniform title used as a 
heading or reference. 
 
In other words, add to the title proper something in parentheses that will distinguish it from 
other serials with the same title. 
 
Select from the following: 
a) place of publication 
b) corporate body 
c) place and date; or corporate body and date 
d) date 
e) edition statement, other title information, etc. 
 
For example: 
 Forum (Zagreb, Croatia) 
 Bulletin (Confederation nationale des cadres du Quebec) 
 New broadside (New York, N.Y. : 1970) 
 Newsletter (Ontario Bird Banding Association : 1997) 
 Broadside (1909) 
 
 
Check an Authority File 
As with other headings, it is wise to check in an authority file. Uniform titles for serials are 
usually found in a name authority file, e.g., Library of Congress Authorities.

<p>Sources of Catalog Copy  
There are many sources of cataloging copy. These range from exchanging records within a co-
operative network to purchasing catalog records, either in hard or electronic co   py from 
commercial suppliers. Some library suppliers provide records with the items when they are 
purchased. There are also companies from whom retrospective records are available. 
 
 
Cataloging-in-Publication (CIP) 
Cataloging-in-Publication is usually printed in the work. This means that it is created before the 
work is published, and often before it is completed. 
 
Since changes can occur between creation of the CIP and publication, and the cataloger usually 
does not see the completed work, it is less reliable cataloging copy than a record from an 
established cataloging source. 
 
It is also incomplete, since it does not contain publication and physical description details. 
However it is still valuable, especially if no other records are readily available. 
 
 
Using Cataloging Copy 
&bull; Check that the cataloging copy and the item in hand are the same. 
&bull; Check the correctness of the copy: 
 - descriptive cataloging 
 - classification number 
 - subject headings 
&bull; Accept the copy; or modify it to suit the needs of your library. 
 
 
Buying Catalog Cards 
If catalog cards are acquired, it is rarely cost-effective to alter them, other than to add your 
library&rsquo;s call number to each card. They must then be filed in the catalog according to the 
heading, and the additional main entry card in the shelf list by the call number. It is useful to 
mark the shelf list card with, for example, &ldquo;S.L.&rdquo; to avoid confusion with the catalog cards. 
 
 
Problems / Errors Found in Copy Cataloging 
The following are among the most common errors to watch for: 
&bull; transcription errors, e.g., misspelling, punctuation, number of pages 
&bull; missing information, e.g., areas of description, elements of description, added entries 
&bull; outdated copy, e.g., AACR1 
&bull; differences relating to local holdings, e.g., 
</p>
<p>- multivolume works&mdash;the library may have only partial holdings 
- different publisher, all the other information is the same.

Procedure for Adding Extra Copies 
&bull; Check the catalog for the exact record. 
&bull; Check the item to ensure it is not a new edition. 
&bull; Write the call number in the appropriate position on the item. 
&bull; Add the number of copies to the automated system (or shelf list in a manual system). 
&bull; Send the item for processing. 
 
 
Creating Catalog Cards 
If your library produces its own catalog cards, begin by creating a main entry card, with a main 
entry heading, description and tracings. Add subject headings and a call number.  
 
Make the required number of copies of this card&mdash;one for each tracing, plus one for the shelf list. 
Add one heading to the top of each card, and mark the shelf list card with, for example, &ldquo;S.L.&rdquo; to 
avoid confusion with the catalog cards.  
 
For title added entry cards (i.e., if the tracing is &ldquo;Title&rdquo;), add only the title proper to the top of 
the card (Rule 21.30J1). 
 
For series added entry cards when the series is traced the same (i.e., if the tracing is &ldquo;Series&rdquo;), add 
the series title exactly as it appears in the series statement. For series added entry cards when the 
series is traced differently (e.g., if the tracing is &ldquo;Series: Library education series (Lanham, Md.)&rdquo;), 
add the series heading given in the tracing. 
 
For all other added entry and subject cards, add the heading exactly as given in the tracing. 
 
File the catalog cards alphabetically according to the heading, and the shelf list card numerically 
by the call number. </p>

<p>Levels of Cataloging Work 
Until quite recently, original cataloging was regarded as a professional activity in libraries&mdash;that 
is, it was done by qualified librarians, and library technicians usually did copy cataloging and 
catalog maintenance. 
 
This situation is changing: catalogs are being automated and the skills of library technicians are 
increasingly recognized. 
 
Libraries also differ, and individual interests and skills as well as the pressures of work are factors 
in the allocation of responsibilities.

<p>REVISION QUIZ 17.4 
a. Physical forms include: 
</p>
<p>&bull; book 
&bull; card 
&bull; microfiche 
&bull; CD-ROM 
&bull; online 
&bull; computer printout. 
</p>
<p> 
b. Online catalogs give users more access&mdash;by keyword, ISBN, call no., etc. But they may need help to 
</p>
<p>learn how to use them. 
 
 Books, printouts, etc., are easy to scan, but very difficult to keep updated. 
 
 CD-ROMs offer the same access as OPACs, but are difficult to keep updated. 
 
 Cards are familiar to older users, but offer less access than computer catalogs. 
 
c. &bull; Can be searched using keywords&mdash;not just titles and subject headings 
</p>
<p>&bull; Can be limited&mdash;by date of publication, type of material, etc. 
&bull; Can take the user to catalogs of other libraries, other databases, etc. 
</p>
<p>  
d. Original cataloging is cataloging from scratch, using all the appropriate cataloging tools&mdash;AACR2, 
</p>
<p>DDC or LCC, LSCH, etc. 
 Copy cataloging is using another record as the basis, and checking using cataloging tools. 
 
e. Centralized cataloging is cataloging all copies in a central location, and sending cataloged items to 
</p>
<p>other locations, e.g., a public library system where the main library does all the cataloging for the 
branches. 
</p>
<p> 
f. &bull; cheaper and quicker&mdash;cataloging is only done once per title, however many copies are bought 
</p>
<p>&bull; consistency and high standards&mdash;fewer specialist cataloging staff 
&bull; cataloging staff builds up more expertise 
&bull; fewer sets of cataloging tools needed (they are expensive) 
&bull; end processing can also be centralized 
</p>
<p> 
g. &bull;  de-skilling of other library staff 
</p>
<p>&bull; local branches have no control over the subject headings, etc.&mdash;more difficult to relate 
cataloging to needs of users  
</p>
<p>&bull; other staff have fewer tasks to share around&mdash;risk of professional staff being bored 
 
h.  &bull; sharing ideas, skills, work 
</p>
<p>&bull; consistency among members of the network 
&bull; knowledge of what other libraries in the network collect 
&bull; possibility of sharing professional expertise 
&bull; awareness of scrutiny of other professionals may help keep standards high 
&bull; savings of time and effort 
</p>
<p> 
i. &bull; may take longer if a library waits for another library to catalog an item 
</p>
<p>&bull; standards may not be consistent 
&bull; required levels of cataloging may not match 
</p>
<p> 
j.  &bull; copy catalog from a network 
</p>
<p>&bull; buy records from a supplier when you buy the items 
&bull; use CIP 
&bull; join a network and share records

</p>
<p> 
l. Public services 
</p>
<p>Technical services 
 
m. Cataloging is part of technical services. 
 
n. The catalog is produced and maintained by technical services staff. Public services staff use and help 
</p>
<p>clients to use the catalog to locate information. 
 
o.  &bull; Many items may be out on loan, being used in the library or waiting to be re-shelved. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Different formats may be shelved in different areas of the library. 
&bull; Many items cover more than one subject, or one subject from several aspects, and all items on a 
</p>
<p> subject may not have the same classsification number. 
 
p. A union catalog records the holdings of more than one library. It enables clients and library staff to 
</p>
<p>know what other libraries hold, so that they can borrow from them. 
 
q.  &bull; decide to buy the book 
</p>
<p>&bull; place the order

r. Understanding the headings in the catalog helps reader&rsquo;s advisors to find items in the collection. 
 Knowing about bibliographic elements helps acquisitions staff to verify and record details correctly. </p>
