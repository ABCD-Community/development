<p>Thanks are due to the many colleagues with whom I have worked over the years. 
</p>
<p>These include Andrew Jardine, Melinda Hodkiewicz, Joseph Mathew, Tony Healy, 
</p>
<p>Fred Stapelberg, Ray Beebe, Will Scott, Ernst Krauss, Subhash Sharma, and Len 
</p>
<p>Bradshaw, publisher of the Asset and Maintenance Management Journal. These 
</p>
<p>contacts have in many cases combined university research and teaching with 
</p>
<p>industrial project work, and particularly with developing and delivering short 
</p>
<p>training courses. These courses and projects have provided a two-way interchange 
</p>
<p>of information with industry which has substantially shaped the present book.
</p>
<p>Over the years I have enjoyed working with and participating in the activities of 
</p>
<p>what was once called the Maintenance Engineering Society of Australia and is now 
</p>
<p>called the Asset Management Council. Its members and former members include 
</p>
<p>Peter Robinson, Sally Nugent, Jim Kennedy, Peter Kohler, Roger Byrne, and Gary 
</p>
<p>Winsor, among many others. The same applies to members of the International 
</p>
<p>Forum for Research in Maintenance whose members and former members include 
</p>
<p>Bill Gerrards, Tony Christer, Jasper Coetzee, Harry Martin, and David Sherwin.
</p>
<p>Maintenance engineering and asset management research and education at 
</p>
<p>Queensland University of Technology have been sponsored at various times by 
</p>
<p>Mount Isa Mines Ltd., by the Queensland Electricity Supply Industry, and by the 
</p>
<p>Cooperative Research Centre in Integrated Engineering Asset Management.
</p>
<p>There is a vast amount of organizational documentation in this field. This includes 
</p>
<p>the ISO55000 and IEC 60300 series standards, and the American Petroleum Institute 
</p>
<p>publications. On the other hand there are relatively few conventional books. I am 
</p>
<p>reminded of a joke that I heard on the radio&hellip; A teacher told her students to write 
</p>
<p>an essay on a subject of their own choosing. A boy submitted an essay called, &ldquo;My 
</p>
<p>Dog&rdquo;. Having read it, the teacher handed it back and said, &ldquo;This essay is exactly the 
</p>
<p>same as your brother wrote last year.&rdquo; The boy said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same dog.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Special thanks are due to my wife Tina, who developed a wonderful family and 
</p>
<p>a prize winning garden while I was stuck in the study or away on-site.

<p>About the Book
</p>
<p>Physical asset management is the management of fixed assets such as machinery,   
</p>
<p>vehicles, equipment, plant, buildings, and infrastructure. This book presents a 
</p>
<p> systematic approach to the management of these assets from concept to disposal. It 
</p>
<p>makes particular reference to the ISO 55000 series of asset management standards.
</p>
<p>It is designed to be suitable as:
</p>
<p>&bull; A textbook for a course in asset management to senior undergraduate or graduate 
</p>
<p>students in asset management, engineering management, public works engineering,  
</p>
<p>systems engineering, industrial engineering, maintenance engineering or operations 
</p>
<p>management.
</p>
<p>&bull; A reference point for engineers and managers working in the asset management 
</p>
<p>field.
</p>
<p>&bull; An introduction to ISO55000 and a reference point for the techniques required 
</p>
<p>to implement this standard.
</p>
<p>The book introduces the general principles of physical asset management, 
</p>
<p> covering all stages of the asset life cycle. This starts with initial business appraisal 
</p>
<p>and proceeds through identification of fixed asset needs, capability gap analysis, 
</p>
<p>financial evaluation, logistic support analysis, life cycle costing, management 
</p>
<p>of in-service assets, maintenance strategy, outsourcing, budgeting, cost-benefit 
</p>
<p> analysis, disposal, and renewal. Industries to which this is applicable include: 
</p>
<p>manufacturing; distribution; mining; electricity generation and supply; oil and 
</p>
<p>gas; water; roads; railways; aviation; shipping; hospitals; retail centers; defense 
</p>
<p> material; recreation and sporting facilities and local government.
</p>
<p>The chapters in this book are designed to introduce material in a logical 
</p>
<p>sequence. As a whole year educational program it is suggested that Chaps. 1&ndash;16 
</p>
<p>provide material for the first semester and Chaps. 17&ndash;29 provide material for the 
</p>
<p>second semester.

<p>4 1 Introduction to Asset Management
</p>
<p>1.2  Evolution of Asset Management
</p>
<p>The development of physical assets has been a hallmark of human activity from 
</p>
<p>early times. Figure 1.1 shows military wagons from the city of Ur dating from 
</p>
<p>2600 B.C. Clearly the citizens of Ur were familiar with the wheel, but this means 
</p>
<p>that there must also have been artisans who were familiar with the bearing, on 
</p>
<p>which the wheel depends, with lubrication on which the bearing depends, and 
</p>
<p>with the lathe and other woodworking and metalworking tools needed to build the 
</p>
<p>wheels and the wagons. A developed system of manufacture, maintenance, and 
</p>
<p>logistic support for these assets must have existed from a very early date.
</p>
<p>Despite these early beginnings, physical asset management has never been 
</p>
<p>a well-understood activity within populations at large. The pattern of educa-
</p>
<p>tional and professional specializations has generally by-passed the physical asset 
</p>
<p>management field. Various technical areas, such as defense, aviation, and civil 
</p>
<p>works, have evolved their own approaches to the topic, under such headings as 
</p>
<p>logistics, systems engineering, public works engineering, infrastructure, and 
</p>
<p>maintenance.
</p>
<p>1.2.1  Why Do We Need Asset Management?
</p>
<p>The need for asset management as a recognized discipline arises from the complex 
</p>
<p>technical nature of modern systems. Let us take an example from aviation. A con-
</p>
<p>trast can be drawn between, on the one hand, the Wright Brothers Flyer of 1903 
</p>
<p>(Fig. 1.2), which was the first aircraft to achieve controlled flight, and on the other 
</p>
<p>hand, the modern aviation industry.
</p>
<p>Initially, the Wright brothers designed, built, flew, repaired, and financed their 
</p>
<p>own aircraft. They did not need asset management as a separate activity. But, avia-
</p>
<p>tion today involves flight operations, engineering, maintenance, finance, human 
</p>
<p>resources, and a wide range of asset types on a huge scale. Figure 1.3 gives 
</p>
<p>some indication of this. It is this vast increase in complexity, across a wide range 
</p>
<p>of industries, which has led to the need for asset management as a recognized 
</p>
<p>discipline.

</p>
<p>1.3  ISO 55000 Series Asset Management Standards
</p>
<p>In recent years, a determined effort by those working in the field has resulted in 
</p>
<p>the development of a formal approach to asset management systems, knowledge, 
</p>
<p>and education. This led to the publication in 2014 of the International Standards 
</p>
<p>Organization&rsquo;s ISO 55000 series of Asset Management standards.1 These stand-
</p>
<p>ards supersede the earlier document known as PAS-55, and are complementary to 
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55000 Asset management. Overview, principles and terminology. ISBN: 978 0 580 86467 4 
ISO 55001 Asset management. Management systems&mdash;Requirements. ISBN: 978 0 580 75128 8

<p>6 1 Introduction to Asset Management
</p>
<p>the International Infrastructure Management Manual.2 These developments have 
</p>
<p>been accompanied by the formation of Asset Management professional organiza-
</p>
<p>tions in many countries. This has acted as a catalyst for the recognition of the key 
</p>
<p>role of asset management in modern organizations and has led to a demand for 
</p>
<p>mainstream education and training in physical asset management.
</p>
<p>The ISO 55000 series standards are designed as a guide for organizations 
</p>
<p>involved in establishing, implementing, and maintaining asset management systems 
</p>
<p>and for the planning, design, and implementation of asset management activities.
</p>
<p>ISO 55000 gives an overview of the asset management topic and the definitions 
</p>
<p>of terms used.
</p>
<p>ISO 55001 specifies requirements for establishing and maintaining an asset man-
</p>
<p>agement system and for supporting the delivery of asset management activities.
</p>
<p>ISO 55002 provides guidelines for the implementation of the requirements 
</p>
<p>specified in ISO 55001.
</p>
<p>This book links its main subject matter to the ISO 55000 series of standards and 
</p>
<p>provides examples, exercises, explanations, and discussion to assist in the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of the principles involved. It also covers a range of related topics which 
</p>
<p>are important in a business setting. These include financial analysis, budgeting, risk 
</p>
<p>analysis and risk management, and reliability and maintenance management.
</p>
<p>Footnotes to various sections in this book give cross references to the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding clauses in the ISO 55000 series standards. In addition, Chap. 29 deals 
</p>
<p>specifically with the standards. Section 29.2 gives a detailed series of cross ref-
</p>
<p>erences from ISO 55001 to corresponding chapters, sections, and figures in this 
</p>
<p>book. Section 29.4 discusses the Strategic Asset management Plan (SAMP), which 
</p>
<p>forms a central feature of the documentation required by the standard. Other sec-
</p>
<p>tions of Chap. 29 assist the reader to relate their own asset management system 
</p>
<p>and its status to the requirements of the standard.
</p>
<p>1.4  What is an Asset?
</p>
<p>The asset management standard ISO 55000 defines an asset3 as:
</p>
<p>an item, thing or entity that has potential or actual value to an organization.
</p>
<p>This is a very general definition which can cover any type of asset. To focus our 
</p>
<p>thinking, we can recognize the following types of assets which can normally be 
</p>
<p>identified within organizations:
</p>
<p>&bull; Physical Assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Financial Assets

</p>
<p>&bull; Human Assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Information Assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Intangible Assets
</p>
<p>Physical assets are items such as plant, machinery, buildings, roads, vehicles, rail-
</p>
<p>ways, aircraft, pipes, wires, communications equipment, and other infrastructure.
</p>
<p>Besides physical assets, we also consider financial, human, and information 
</p>
<p>assets to the extent that they support the management of physical assets. Intangible 
</p>
<p>assets are nonphysical things such as goodwill and intellectual property.
</p>
<p>1.4.1  Who Needs Asset Management?
</p>
<p>Organizations in which physical asset management is of particular importance 
</p>
<p>include all those involving plant, machinery, buildings, roads and bridges, utilities 
</p>
<p>such as electricity, gas and water, transport industries; oil and gas extraction and 
</p>
<p>processing; mining and minerals processing; chemicals, manufacturing, distribu-
</p>
<p>tion, aviation, and defense.
</p>
<p>1.5  Asset Management Role
</p>
<p>Asset management sits at a meeting point between the technical and business 
</p>
<p>fields. The role of the asset manager is to bring to bear a combination of technical 
</p>
<p>knowledge and business knowledge in order to effectively and efficiently meet the 
</p>
<p>asset-related needs of the business as a whole. This involves a number of specific 
</p>

</p>
<p>port over the asset life cycle.
</p>
<p>The typical asset manager is likely to be an engineer, maintenance manager, 
</p>
<p>or logistics specialist who has become involved with business decisions, which 
</p>
<p>require both technical knowledge and a financial focus. Asset management is, 
</p>
<p>however, a separate activity from technical engineering and from maintenance 
</p>
<p>management. This is because the practice of engineering or of maintenance man-
</p>
<p>agement require time, dedication, and a focus which is different from the combi-
</p>
<p>nation of logistic and business issues involved in asset management.
</p>
<p>With regard to other roles in business, finance and accounting specialists are 
</p>
<p>aware of fixed assets as a balance sheet entry whose technical depths are unknown. 
</p>
<p>Information technologists are skilled in establishing data management and commu-
</p>
<p>nication systems, but the structure, content, and use of the information lie elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Senior managers from political, legal, financial, or marketing backgrounds have 
</p>
<p>business priorities and short-term imperatives and must rely on asset managers for 
</p>
<p>sound asset-related advice. And lobbyists for particular solutions may put forward 
</p>
<p>unbalanced views of asset development options.
</p>
<p>To the public, debate may rage over the provision of facilities, or issues such 
</p>
<p>as environmental impact, but this rarely involves a balanced appreciation of what

<p>is involved in planning, financing, creating, operating, and maintaining assets. 
</p>
<p>Vocalized or politicized fads and fancies can overwhelm the voice of asset man-
</p>
<p>agement in the short term, but eventually the realities come home to roost. This 
</p>
<p>book seeks to achieve a holistic view of asset management, which can help create 
</p>
<p>a new generation of professionals in this important field.
</p>
<p>1.6  An Accountant&rsquo;s View of Assets
</p>
<p>Asset management links closely with financial management and asset managers 
</p>
<p>need to able to express their opinions in the language of accounting and finance. It 
</p>
<p>is important to recognize the accounting definition of assets, and in particular the 
</p>
<p>split between fixed and current assets. The reason for this distinction lies in how 
</p>
<p>the items are treated from a tax point of view.
</p>
<p>1.6.1  Fixed Asset
</p>
<p>A fixed asset (also called a non-current asset) is a physical item which has 
</p>
<p>value over a period exceeding one year, for example, land, buildings, plant, and 
</p>
<p> machinery. When fixed assets are acquired, their cost cannot be counted as an 
</p>
<p>expense for tax purposes in the year of acquisition. When we buy or sell fixed 
</p>
<p>assets we are regarded as having swapped one asset&mdash;money&mdash;for another asset, 
</p>
<p>a machine, for example. Only the depreciation of the machine in any given year is 
</p>
<p>considered to be an expense in that year. This is important as far as tax treatment 
</p>
<p>is concerned. Planning for the acquisition or disposal of fixed assets involves the 
</p>
<p>Capital Expenditure budget or CAPEX (Fig. 1.4).
</p>
<p>Fixed Assets are the physical 
</p>
<p>things that our organization 
</p>
<p>uses in carrying out our 
</p>
<p>business.  Examples are, trains 
</p>
<p>and boats and planes; land, 
</p>
<p>buildings, machinery and so 
</p>
<p>on.  The distinguishing feature 
</p>
<p>of fixed assets is that they are 
</p>
<p>physical   items which 
</p>
<p>normally remain with, and 
</p>
<p>retain value within the 
</p>
<p>organization, for a period of 
</p>
<p>longer than one year.
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.4  A fixed asset</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9
</p>
<p>1.6.2  Current Asset
</p>
<p>Faster moving assets such as: cash; accounts receivable; raw materials, work in 
</p>
<p>process, finished goods, consumables are referred to as current assets (Fig. 1.5). 
</p>
<p>Slow moving spares which are normally held for longer than a year should be 
</p>
<p>regarded as fixed assets.
</p>
<p>1.6.3  Expense
</p>
<p>Expense is money or assets consumed in generating sales or service in the cur-
</p>
<p>rent year. This typically includes wages, materials, and overhead costs. In manu-
</p>
<p>facturing it will comprise the materials and labor that go into making the goods 
</p>
<p>sold in the year, plus administrative costs. It also includes depreciation, which is 
</p>
<p>the proportion of the fixed assets &ldquo;consumed&rdquo; in the year. Planning for operating 
</p>
<p>expenses involves the Operating Expense budget or OPEX.
</p>
<p>1.6.4  Liabilities
</p>
<p>Liabilities are money that we owe. Short-term liabilities are amounts that we will 
</p>
<p>need to pay in the immediate future, such as bills for recent purchases or inter-
</p>
<p>est or capital payments due in the current year. Loans that we will repay in future 
</p>
<p>years are long-term liabilities.
</p>
<p>Current Assets are 
</p>
<p>convertible or mobile in 
</p>
<p>nature.
</p>
<p>They consist of cash or 
</p>
<p>other financial instruments, 
</p>
<p>and physical items which 
</p>
<p>normally move through the 
</p>
<p>system in less than one 
</p>
<p>year.  The following are 
</p>
<p>examples of current assets:
</p>
<p>Cash
</p>
<p>Accounts receivable
</p>
<p>Trade goods, 
</p>
<p>Work in process, 
</p>
<p>Raw materials, 
</p>
<p>Consumables
</p>
<p>Fast moving spares.

</p>
<p>1.6.5  Equity
</p>
<p>Equity means the net value of the company after the liabilities are subtracted from the 
</p>
<p>assets. If the result is not a positive number, the company has gone broke. The assets, 
</p>
<p>liabilities, and equity feature in the company balance sheet. Figure 1.6 illustrates this.
</p>
<p>1.7  What is Asset Management?
</p>
<p>1.7.1  ISO 55000 Definition
</p>
<p>The following definition of asset management is given in ISO 55000.4
</p>
<p>co-ordinated activity of an organisation to realize value from assets.
</p>
<p>1.7.2  Extended Definition of Asset Management
</p>
<p>If we wish to tell someone what asset management involves, we need a definition 
</p>
<p>that is more informative to the general public than that given in ISO 55000. The 
</p>
<p>following is such a definition:
</p>
<p>Given a business or organizational objective, Asset Management is the set of 
</p>
<p>activities associated with:
</p>
<p>&bull; identifying what assets are needed,
</p>
<p>&bull; identifying funding requirements,
</p>
<p>&bull; acquiring assets,
</p>
<p>&bull; providing logistic and maintenance support for assets,
</p>
<p>&bull; disposing and renewing assets,
</p>
<p>so as to effectively and efficiently meet the desired objective.
</p>
<p>4 ISO 55000 Clause 3.3.1.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11
</p>
<p>From this definition we see that asset management encompasses a broader 
</p>
<p>set of activities than &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;, which is primarily concerned with keeping 
</p>
<p>existing equipment in operating condition. Asset management is concerned with 
</p>
<p>applying technical and financial judgement and sound management practices to 
</p>
<p>deciding what assets we need to meet our business aims, and then to acquiring and 
</p>
<p>logistically sustaining the assets over their whole life, through to disposal.
</p>
<p>1.8  Aim of Asset Management
</p>
<p>The aim of asset management is to enable the organization to have the assets that are 
</p>
<p>appropriate to its business needs, and to provide supporting services so that these can 
</p>
<p>operate effectively. In more abstract terms, the aim of asset management is to enable an 
</p>
<p>organization to realize value from its assets as it pursues its organizational objectives. 
</p>
<p>Asset management supports the realization of value while balancing financial, environ-
</p>
<p>mental and social costs, risk, level and quality of service, and asset performance.
</p>
<p>1.8.1  Asset Management System
</p>
<p>A basic illustration of the role of physical assets and of asset management within 
</p>
<p>an organization is shown in Fig. 1.7. There we see that the key driver is customer 
</p>
<p>demand which lead to business objectives and business plans. To meet the business 
</p>
<p>objective we need business operations which require the support of physical 
</p>
<p>assets. Asset management works to provide assets to support the business opera-
</p>
<p>tions. This requires an asset management system5 which supports asset planning, 
</p>
<p>acquisition, maintenance, and logistics. Other support services such as information 
</p>
<p>technology, financial and legal services are also required across all the activities.6
</p>
<p>1.9  The Asset Life Cycle7,8
</p>
<p>Figure 1.8 illustrates, in broad outline, the life cycle of a physical asset. The main 
</p>
<p>stages in the life cycle are:
</p>
<p>5 ISO 55001 Clause 4.4 Asset Management System: &ldquo;The organization shall establish&hellip; an asset 
management system&hellip;&rdquo;.
6 ISO 55000 Clause 2.4.2 Fundamentals: &ldquo;Asset management is based on a set of fundamentals&hellip;
This includes&hellip;integration with finance, human resources, information systems, logistics and 
</p>
<p>operations.&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>Asset managers are involved in all aspects of the asset life cycle for the following

<p>&bull; To provide knowledgeable input into the process of budgeting for the capital 
</p>
<p>and operating costs over the whole asset life cycle.
</p>
<p>&bull; To ensure that systems are in place to support the asset over its lifetime.

</p>
<p>1.9.1  Asset Decision Support
</p>
<p>The complexity of modern asset-intensive businesses means that a well-developed 
</p>
<p>asset management function is needed to provide support for asset-related deci-
</p>
<p>sions. In the area of capital planning and budgeting, or CAPEX, this involves:
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset (and associated capability) development planning and implementation
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset continuity planning and implementation
</p>
<p>&bull; Logistic support facilities development and management
</p>
<p>&bull; Business case development for related capital budgets
</p>
<p>In the area of operating budget or OPEX it involves decisions related to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Organization wide, asset-related systems and procedures, e.g., maintenance facili-
</p>
<p>ties, computer systems applications in asset management and maintenance, shut-
</p>
<p>down/turnaround planning;
</p>
<p>&bull; Stock control systems for consumables and spares;
</p>
<p>&bull; Development and management of maintenance outsourcing;
</p>
<p>&bull; Awareness and management of regulatory compliance;
</p>
<p>&bull; Business case development for related operating budgets.
</p>
<p>Asset managers need to be able to provide an overview of the asset situation and be 
</p>
<p>aware of factors such as the age and condition of asset fleets, the evolving role of assets 
</p>
<p>in the business, and of developments in terms of technical and service expectations. 
</p>
<p>For examples and further discussion see the chapter entitled &ldquo;Know Your Assets&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>1.9.2  Regulation
</p>
<p>Another factor that creates the need for a professional level of asset management 
</p>
<p>is the rise in regulations, which has grown alongside the increasing complexity of 
</p>
<p>industry. The need for compliance with regulations is an essential feature of mod-
</p>
<p>ern industry. Regulations apply to many aspects of industrial operations, in such 
</p>
<p>things as health, safety, and environmental impact.9,10
</p>
<p>Activities that are impacted by regulation include materials handling and stor-
</p>
<p>age, maintenance access, chemicals use or processing, pressure vessels, hot or 
</p>
<p>cold areas, high or enclosed spaces. Design and operation of industrial equipment 
</p>
<p>requires familiarity with the relevant regulatory regimes, and this reflects back on 
</p>
<p>asset acquisition, maintenance, and logistic systems. It is for these reasons that we 
</p>
<p>now need the comprehensive approach to asset management which is addressed by 
</p>
<p>the ISO 55000 standard.
</p>
<p>9 OHSAS 18001 Occupational health and safety management systems requirements.
10 ISO 14001 Environmental management system requirements.

<p>14 1 Introduction to Asset Management
</p>
<p>1.10  Asset Management Basic Questions
</p>
<p>Asset management needs to continuously provide answers to basic questions about 
</p>
<p>any asset, such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Does it work?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is it safe?
</p>
<p>&bull; Does it support the business aim?
</p>
<p>In relation to our business aims have we got the right:
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment by type and location;
</p>
<p>&bull; Support facilities, buildings, logistics, and services by type and location;
</p>
<p>&bull; Support personnel by quantity and skills?
</p>
<p>If not, what should we be doing about it, for example:
</p>
<p>Developing a case for activities such as the following and following up with the 
</p>
<p>appropriate level of management:
</p>
<p>&bull; Buildings, plant, machinery, equipment: buy or sell, lease or terminate lease;
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset support facilities expand, contract, consolidate, relocate;
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset support personnel, recruit, reduce, train, outsource, in-source.
</p>
<p>1.11  Dangers of Poor Asset Management
</p>
<p>In asset intensive businesses it is essential to structure the organization so that the 
</p>
<p>development, acquisition, and operation of the assets are carried out effectively. 
</p>
<p>Business functions, such as Sales, Operations, Finance, and Human Resource 
</p>
<p>Management, may be clearly represented in the business structure, whereas asset 
</p>
<p>management can be a &ldquo;gray area&rdquo;, beneath the purview of senior management, but 
</p>
<p>above the level of maintenance. Figure 1.9 illustrates this.
</p>
<p>A lack of asset management focus can lead to problems from poor communica-
</p>
<p>tion between operations and maintenance on the one hand and senior management 
</p>
<p>on the other. This applies to both the understanding of physical situations and to 
</p>
<p>the financial steps needed to address an actual or potential problem.
</p>
<p>As an example, a fitter may see a problem of equipment availability, such as 
</p>
<p>when a shortage of tires leads to a loss of availability in a fleet of dump trucks. But 
</p>
<p>from an overall business sense, it is not readily apparent whether this is a tempo-
</p>
<p>rary problem which it is best to live with, or whether more tires or more trucks are 
</p>
<p>needed. To get the best solution will require analysis of the business operational 
</p>
<p>plan and the asset management plan. Figures 1.10 and 1.11 illustrate this dilemma. 
</p>
<p>The ongoing recurrence of problems of this type indicates the essential role played 
</p>
<p>by the asset manager.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15
</p>
<p>Successful asset management requires recognition and effective implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of the functions indicated in the definition of asset management in Sect. 1.7.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;gray area&rdquo; of Fig. 1.9 needs to be replaced by the functions shown in

<p>1.12  Benefits of Good Asset Management
</p>
<p>Good asset management provides the following benefits which enable an organi-
</p>
<p>zation to effectively and efficiently deliver business capability, and to achieve its 
</p>
<p>aims in regard to profitability and service delivery:
</p>
<p>&bull; A systematic approach to asset-based decisions, so that asset requirements, 
</p>
<p>acquisition, and disposal match the objectives of the business;
</p>
<p>&bull; Appropriate logistic support over the asset life cycle, creating improvements in 
</p>
<p>asset performance;
</p>
<p>&bull; Effective internal processes for managing assets;
</p>
<p>&bull; Benefits in meeting business and regulatory targets, including:
</p>
<p>&ndash; operational targets,
</p>
<p>&ndash; financial targets,
</p>
<p>&ndash; environmental regulations,
</p>
<p>&ndash; health and safety regulations,
</p>
<p>&ndash; insurance requirements,
</p>
<p>&ndash; risk management.
</p>
<p>&bull; A systematic framework for the training and development of staff, in under-
</p>
<p>standing and managing the asset portfolio.
</p>
<p>The ISO 55000 series of standards provides a general framework for the manage-
</p>
<p>ment of physical assets. The adoption of ISO 55000 can provide:
</p>
<p>&bull; A structured view and understanding of asset management;
</p>
<p>&bull; Effective relationships between top management, asset management, operations, 
</p>
<p>and maintenance;
</p>
<p>&bull; Improvements in asset financial returns;
</p>
<p>&bull; Well-informed asset management decisions;
</p>
<p>&bull; Insurance, health and safety, regulatory, and risk management benefits;
</p>
<p>&bull; Company recognition/marketing;
</p>
<p>&bull; Improvements in training and development.
</p>
<p>1.13  The Asset Death Spiral
</p>
<p>Classic situations have arisen where a plant is central to business profitability, but it 
</p>
<p>is aging&mdash;in other words, it is an aging cash cow. Senior managers see no glory in it 
</p>
<p>and the engineers have been redeployed to projects elsewhere. Capital funding is cut 
</p>
<p>and the maintenance budget is cut. Spending on simple problems falls, and in time, 
</p>
<p>simple problems become big problems. Eventually a major accident occurs resulting 
</p>
<p>in fatalities, financial loss, and ignominy for those unfortunate enough to be involved. 
</p>
<p>The situation is known as the Asset Death Spiral and is illustrated in Fig. 1.13.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 1.13 initially the plant is running with an appropriate level of budget, 
</p>
<p>which we have shown schematically as being divided between Non-Routine

<p>18 1 Introduction to Asset Management
</p>
<p>Maintenance, Routine Maintenance, and Renewal. The total budget is then cut, 
</p>
<p>reflecting a perceived reduced importance of the plant. Breakdowns still occur, so 
</p>
<p>non-routine maintenance work must be carried out, but this now requires resources 
</p>
<p>funded from a reduction in expenditure on routine maintenance and/or renewal. 
</p>
<p>This reduction exacerbates the situation, causing more breakdowns, which in turn 
</p>
<p>further reduces the routine and renewal budgets, so that the plant spirals down into 
</p>
<p>a situation where the entire budget is being spent on breakdowns. Eventually the 
</p>
<p>maintenance department is overwhelmed and the plant dies.

<p>In March 2005, an explosion occurred at BP&rsquo;s Texas City oil refinery. 15 peo-
</p>
<p>ple were killed. This was the worst industrial accident in the US for more than 
</p>
<p>10 years, and led to lawsuits and inquiries. Carolyn Merritt, who chairs the US 
</p>
<p>Chemical Safety Board, said in October 2006 that:

<p>1.14.3  Gas Processing Plant Exercise
</p>
<p>You are the maintenance superintendent of the Longton Gas Processing Plant and 
</p>
<p>you recently attended a presentation on ISO 55000 Asset Management Standards 
</p>
<p>at a local Asset Management Society group meeting.
</p>
<p>The following week, the plant manager, a recent appointee in the role, tells a 
</p>
<p>meeting of senior staff that the plant is running smoothly and has a good finan-
</p>
<p>cial record, but that some cost cutting is needed to support developments on other 
</p>
<p>sites. He says that the engineers currently on-site are being transferred to head 
</p>
<p>office, 220 km away, and that the maintenance budget (CAPEX and OPEX) is to 
</p>
<p>be cut by 10 %.
</p>
<p>You are concerned at this. Most of the items of plant are nearing the end of 
</p>
<p>their useful life and maintenance demands are increasing. Although you are famil-
</p>
<p>iar with the maintenance of the plant, you rely on the engineers for failure diag-
</p>
<p>nosis and for dealing with nonstandard conditions that occur when component 
</p>
<p>change-outs or shutdowns are required. You plan to express these concerns to the 
</p>
<p>plant manager.
</p>
<p>Prepare a series of dot points that you intend to cover in your meeting with the 
</p>
<p>plant manager.

<p>20 1 Introduction to Asset Management
</p>
<p>1.15  Solutions to Exercises
</p>
<p>1.15.1  Self-Assessment Quiz 1.1
</p>
<p>1. Why has Asset Management become more important in recent years than it was 
</p>
<p>100 years ago?
</p>
<p>The complexity of modern asset-intensive businesses means that a well-developed 
</p>
<p>asset management function is needed to provide support for asset-related decisions.
</p>
<p>2. How does ISO 55000 define the word &ldquo;Asset&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>ISO 55000 defines an asset as &ldquo;an item, thing or entity that has potential value 
</p>
<p>to an organization.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>3. Name five different types of asset that we find in large organizations.
</p>
<p>Five types of assets are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Physical Assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Financial Assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Human Assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Information Assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Intangible Assets
</p>
<p>4. Give an example of each type of asset from an organization with which you are 
</p>
<p>familiar.
</p>
<p>You will need your own solution for this one.
</p>
<p>5. What is the role of asset management in an organization?
</p>
<p>The role of asset management is to effectively and efficiently meet the asset 
</p>
<p>related needs of the business as a whole, by bringing to bear a combination of 
</p>
<p>technical knowledge and business knowledge. This involves a number of areas 
</p>
<p>of professional activity in asset appraisal, asset acquisition, and logistic support 
</p>
<p>over the asset life cycle.
</p>
<p>6. Why is asset management a separate activity to engineering and maintenance? 
</p>
<p>Because the practice of engineering or of maintenance management both 
</p>
<p>require time, dedication, and a focus which is different from the combination of 
</p>
<p>logistic and business issues involved in asset management.
</p>
<p>1.15.2  Self-Assessment Quiz 1.2
</p>
<p>1. What is the difference between a fixed asset and a current asset? Why is this 
</p>
<p>distinction made?
</p>
<p>A fixed asset (also called a non-current asset) is a physical item which has 
</p>
<p>value over a period exceeding 1 year, for example, land, buildings, plant, and 
</p>
<p>machinery. Faster moving assets such as: cash; accounts receivable; inventory 
</p>
<p>(materials, work in process, finished goods, consumables) are referred to as 
</p>
<p>current assets. The reason for this distinction lies in how the items are treated 
</p>
<p>from a tax point of view.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21
</p>
<p>2. What is the ISO 55000 definition of asset management?
</p>
<p>The following definition of asset management is given in ISO 55000
</p>
<p>co-ordinated activity of an organisation to realize value from assets.
</p>
<p>3. Give a definition of Asset Management which explains what it is about to some-
</p>
<p>one who doesn&rsquo;t know.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given a business or organisational objective, Asset Management is the set of 
</p>
<p>activities associated with:
</p>
<p>&bull; identifying what assets are needed,
</p>
<p>&bull; identifying funding requirements,
</p>
<p>&bull; acquiring assets,
</p>
<p>&bull; providing logistic and maintenance support systems for assets,
</p>
<p>&bull; disposing or renewing assets,
</p>
<p>so as to effectively and efficiently meet the desired objective.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>4. What should a manager do if he or she thinks that his area is short of essential 
</p>
<p>equipment or resources?
</p>
<p>Develop a case for activities such as the following and follow-up with the 
</p>
<p>appropriate level of management:
</p>
<p>&bull; Buildings, plant, machinery, equipment: buy or sell, lease or terminate lease,
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset support facilities expand, contract, consolidate, relocate,
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset support personnel, recruit, reduce, train, outsource, in-source.
</p>
<p>5. Name six stages in the asset life cycle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Business need. Identification of business opportunities or needs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pre-acquisition analysis, physical and financial&mdash;options selection
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition, including implementation into operations
</p>
<p>&bull; Logistic support provision, such as maintenance facilities, consumables, and 
</p>
<p>spares
</p>
<p>&bull; Operation and maintenance
</p>
<p>&bull; Disposal.
</p>
<p>6. Identify four benefits of good asset management.
</p>
<p>Any of the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; A systematic approach to asset-based decisions, so that asset requirements, 
</p>
<p>acquisition, and disposal match the objectives of the business.
</p>
<p>&bull; Appropriate logistic support over the asset life cycle, creating improvements 
</p>
<p>in asset performance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Effective internal processes for managing assets.
</p>
<p>&bull; Benefits in meeting business and regulatory targets, including:
</p>
<p>&ndash; operational targets,
</p>
<p>&ndash; financial targets,
</p>
<p>&ndash; environmental regulations,

</p>
<p>7. Identify two dangers for an organization which has inadequate resources in 
</p>
<p>asset management.
</p>
<p>A lack of asset management resources can lead to poor communication 
</p>
<p>between operation and maintenance on the one hand and senior management on 
</p>
<p>the other. This applies to both the understanding of physical situations and to 
</p>
<p>the financial steps needed to address an actual or potential problem.

</p>
<p>Dot points to cover in your meeting with the plant manager.
</p>
<p>(a) The plant is nearing the end of its useful life and maintenance demands are 
</p>
<p>increasing.
</p>
<p>(b) Budget cuts will decrease maintenance effort and will accelerate the decline, 
</p>
<p>which will mean more outages and safety risks.
</p>
<p>(c) Asset continuity and renewal planning are needed now.
</p>
<p>(d) I cannot tackle this as maintenance needs my full attention.
</p>
<p>(e) The engineers who might have been a resource for asset management are 
</p>
<p>leaving.
</p>
<p>(f) Technically, the engineers are needed to support nonstandard operating and 
</p>
<p>maintenance issues.
</p>
<p>(g) The profit from the plant means that investment in it should continue.

<p>1.16  A Top Level Decision
</p>
<p>Jock and Sheila were lying in bed one Sunday morning when Jock reached for an 
</p>
<p>envelope that had been lying on the bedside table for a couple of days. He knew 
</p>
<p>what it contained.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to renew the lease on this place,&rdquo; he said. Sheila said nothing, which 
</p>
<p>Jock realized was an ominous sign.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to live somewhere,&rdquo; he ventured, but the silence continued. She must 
</p>
<p>be ahead of him on some other track.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go off the pill next month,&rdquo; Sheila said.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23
</p>
<p>Jock and Sheila had discussed having a family and had agreed that it was what 
</p>
<p>they both wanted. Obviously, going off the pill was a necessary start, but why 
</p>
<p>bring it up now? And what did it have to do with the lease on the flat? Then Jock 
</p>
<p>had a blinding insight.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year he had moved out of the maintenance depart-
</p>
<p>ment of the industrial conglomerate where he worked, and got a job in Asset 
</p>
<p>Management. He didn&rsquo;t know what asset management was, but he liked the sound 
</p>
<p>of it, and more importantly, the job offered a rise in his pay.
</p>
<p>It was the asset management perspective which made him realize that his 
</p>
<p>and Sheila&rsquo;s Sunday morning sports session had morphed into a Business 
</p>
<p>Development Meeting.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some house blocks just released in Mullum Gully,&rdquo; said Sheila.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could go and look at them this afternoon,&rdquo; said Jock. Sheila smiled.

<p>26 2 Structure and Activities
</p>
<p>The asset management function must link into the strategic issues deriving from 
</p>
<p>the business situation which will impact on asset management plans. Developments 
</p>
<p>in the business/asset situation typically include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Trends in demand for product or service.
</p>
<p>&bull; Trends in the type or level of product or service required.
</p>
<p>&bull; Changes in revenue, costs or profitability, for example, due to competition.
</p>
<p>&bull; Opportunities for new business and/or business development
</p>
<p>&bull; Technological developments
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset capability gaps&mdash;gaps in capacity and/or ability in delivering all aspects 
</p>
<p>of the required asset role.
</p>
<p>&bull; Timing issues&mdash;when the assets are required and what lead times are involved
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition strategies, supplier options
</p>
<p>&bull; Age and remaining life of existing assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Regulatory limitations, opportunities, or changes

<p>A flowchart of the asset management system in relation to the business context is 
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 2.1.2
</p>
<p>2.2  Asset Management in the Organization
</p>
<p>A central asset management function is needed at company level, to provide inputs 
</p>
<p>to asset planning, to take a role in major acquisitions and developments and to 
</p>
<p>be involved in the provision of the systems and facilities needed to support assets 
</p>
<p>throughout their life. Asset management is distinct from operations, and does not 
</p>
<p>usually involve the direct design or building of the assets themselves. The exact 
</p>
<p>terminology and reporting structures may vary from organization to organization. 
</p>
<p>Figure 2.2 shows an example of how the senior level of an organization may look.
</p>
<p>2.3  Chief Asset Manager Role3
</p>
<p>An essential step toward successful asset management is to recognize asset man-
</p>
<p>agement as an activity which requires representation at senior level. This is illus-
</p>
<p>trated in Fig. 2.2. The precise title may vary, and what we have referred to here 
</p>

ISO 55001/2 Clause 4.1.

<p>28 2 Structure and Activities
</p>
<p>as a Chief Asset Manager may have a title which refers to or includes planning, 
</p>
<p>logistics, or engineering. The important thing is that representation at the Chief 
</p>
<p>level allows asset management to play its key role in asset-related decisions and 
</p>
<p>activities. This includes the following responsibilities of the Chief Asset Manager:
</p>
<p>&bull; Conveying the asset implications of the organization&rsquo;s business objectives and 
</p>
<p>plans to senior management. This will involve participation by the Chief Asset 
</p>
<p>Manager in the Business Development Group which appears at high level in 
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.2, reporting to the CEO.
</p>
<p>&bull; Developing physical plans and financial proposals for asset-related capital and 
</p>
<p>operating expenditure.
</p>
<p>&bull; Taking responsibility for the many activities that assets require in an asset inten-
</p>
<p>sive organization.
</p>
<p>If asset management decisions fall between, on the one hand, senior managers 
</p>
<p>whose background gives them little appreciation of the physical state of the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s assets in relation to needs, and on the other hand, technical personnel who 
</p>
<p>are too junior within the organization, or too inarticulate in business terms to state 
</p>
<p>their case, then financial and operational disasters can follow. The Chief Asset 
</p>
<p>Manager provides a clear single line of authority and ownership for asset manage-
</p>
<p>ment issues. This covers:
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset management groups which specialize in dealing with particular families 
</p>
<p>of assets,
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset-related financial and administrative staff,
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance and related technical services,
</p>
<p>&bull; Engineering.
</p>
<p>2.4  Asset Management in the Organization (2)
</p>
<p>The existence of a Chief Asset Manager does not mean that all asset management 
</p>
<p>activity is concentrated at the top level. Operating divisions may have asset man-
</p>
<p>agers looking after their own assets, just as they have information technology and 
</p>
<p>accounting staff looking after their own divisional activities in those areas. Asset 
</p>
<p>management skills and awareness4 are needed in many roles, and not just by per-
</p>
<p>sons who are labeled &ldquo;Asset Manager.&rdquo; At the risk of some ambiguity, we shall use 
</p>
<p>the term Asset Manager to cover both a person employed primarily in asset man-
</p>
<p>agement activities and a person who uses an asset management approach in tack-
</p>
<p>ling issues which are only part of their overall job. However, company-wide 
</p>
<p>issues, policies, strategies, systems, and procedures need to be coordinated from 
</p>
<p>the higher level, and we shall assume the existence of a group which we shall refer 
</p>
<p>4 ISO 55001 Clause 7.3 Awareness: &ldquo;Persons&hellip; shall be aware of&hellip;policies&hellip;benefits&hellip;risks&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>29
</p>
<p>to as the asset management group, recognizing that other names may be used in 
</p>
<p>various organizations. Figure 2.3 illustrates how asset management at the divi-
</p>
<p>sional level can combine with asset management at the chief officer level.
</p>
<p>2.5  Asset Management Groups
</p>
<p>Asset management activities and responsibilities impact on a wide range of roles 
</p>
<p>within an organization and are not confined to a specific department. However, in 
</p>
<p>a large organization, effective asset management will benefit from the existence 
</p>
<p>of recognized asset management personnel with expertise in specific areas. These 
</p>
<p>may be formed into distinct groups, the title of which will depend on the technol-
</p>
<p>ogy and the company structure.
</p>
<p>The purpose of an Asset Management Group is to provide resources and exper-
</p>
<p>tise to support the identification, acquisition, in-service support, and disposal of a 
</p>
<p>particular group of physical assets required by the organization.
</p>
<p>An example in defence is the Australian Defence Materiel Organization. This 
</p>
<p>has divisions managing land, sea, and air assets. Within each division are asset 
</p>
<p>management groups referred to as System Program Offices (SPOs). Each SPO 
</p>
<p>manages a particular group of prime assets, such as a type of ship or aircraft and 
</p>
<p>all the associated subsidiary assets. In a civilian airline, groups will correspond 
</p>
<p>to the main aircraft types, with additional groups for ground handling equipment, 
</p>
<p>sales systems, and operations systems.
</p>
<p>An asset management group consists of asset managers with suitable technical 
</p>
<p>backgrounds, with support from personnel in accounting and finance, legal, and 
</p>

<p>30 2 Structure and Activities
</p>
<p>contracting roles. Financial, legal, and engineering staff may be colocated to asset 
</p>
<p>management groups from their professional area. For particular projects, teams 
</p>
<p>will be formed with personnel numbers and skills dependent on the content and 
</p>
<p>size of the project. The asset management groups form a basis from which these 
</p>
<p>teams can be formed.
</p>
<p>The asset management groups have key roles in acquisition and development 
</p>
<p>decisions, acquisition and development projects, and in creating and managing 
</p>
<p>organization-wide systems for equipment support for new and existing assets.
</p>
<p>Figure 2.4 illustrates this structure. An asset management group can involve 
</p>
<p>hundreds of personnel in a large organization. In a smaller organization, the same 
</p>
<p>types of tasks are undertaken and the same types of decisions are made, so that the 
</p>
<p>logic of the processes carries through, even though the tasks may be handled by, 
</p>
<p>say, a works manager, a works engineer, or a maintenance manager in among a 
</p>
<p>range of other commitments.
</p>
<p>2.5.1  Asset Management Groups Example
</p>
<p>Asset management groups are based around the various major equipment areas oper-
</p>
<p>ated by a company. Figure 2.5 shows an example of the asset management groups 
</p>
<p>for an electricity transmission company. The company installs and operates trans-
</p>
<p>mission lines and substations. There are asset management groups for &ldquo;substations&rdquo;

<p>and &ldquo;field&rdquo; with subgroups for switchgear, transformers, transmission lines, and so 
</p>
<p>on. Each group is headed by an asset group manager, supported by technical, logis-
</p>
<p>tics, financial, and commercial staff with competence in the particular field.
</p>
<p>2.6  Integrated Project Teams
</p>
<p>An integrated project team is a team which is formed to manage a major project. 
</p>
<p>The team may typically be led from the most closely related asset management 
</p>
<p>group, or from the business development group. The team will draw on asset man-
</p>
<p>agement personnel, augmented by financial, contract, and engineering specialists 
</p>
<p>as necessary. These specialists may be involved with a particular project team on 
</p>
<p>a full-time or part-time basis depending on the amount of work required. A team 
</p>
<p>may include representatives from stakeholder groups.
</p>
<p>Asset management groups often have primary responsibility for projects of a 
</p>
<p>wide range of types. Project teams may bring in staff members from other asset 
</p>
<p>management groups where multiple technologies are involved.
</p>
<p>2.7  Asset Knowledge5
</p>
<p>The management of assets is dependent on knowledge about the organization&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>assets. This involves knowledge of the current equipment in terms of its tech-
</p>
<p>nology, deployment, condition, and business role. It also involves knowledge of 
</p>

agement system.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>potential future developments. Asset managers need to have a practical working 
</p>
<p>knowledge of the major assets at a management level, so as to be able to make 
</p>
<p>sound business decisions. They need to be aware of the assets which constitute 
</p>
<p>elements in any given capability, that is, the array of subsidiary items which are 
</p>
<p>necessary to support particular prime equipment. There is also a requirement for 
</p>
<p>configuration management, that is, keeping systematic track of changes to equip-
</p>
<p>ment configurations, such as technical upgrades and regulatory compatibilities.
</p>
<p>For major items for which future capital decisions are required, it is advisable 
</p>
<p>to list the date and type of the decisions that will be needed. For example, for a 
</p>
<p>truck fleet, we need knowledge of the years of remaining effective life of vehi-
</p>
<p>cles, and of the lead time for acquisition of replacements, so that we can plan our 
</p>
<p>replacement strategy sufficiently far in advance. This knowledge, combined with 
</p>
<p>an assessment of the future requirements of the business, and of developments 
</p>
<p>in the types of equipment available from manufacturers, will enable us to make 
</p>
<p>sound and timely decisions within the constraints of business risk. A summary of 
</p>
<p>points of knowledge which an asset manager needs to have is shown in Table 2.1.
</p>
<p>2.8  Asset Management Activities
</p>
<p>A life cycle diagram is shown in Fig. 2.6, giving more detail than the outline in 
</p>
<p>Chap. 1. We shall use this cycle in considering the various activities of asset man-
</p>
<p>agement. The main steps in the cycle are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of business opportunities or needs
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset capability gap analysis and requirements analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Pre-feasibility analysis, physical and financial&mdash;options selection

<p>3 What is the business significance of our major assets
</p>
<p>4 What is the profit and loss position of our major assets
</p>
<p>5 What is our asset utilization including peak load and seasonal factors
</p>
<p>6 Are there gross imbalances&mdash;that is, major shortages, surpluses or misallocations  
of equipment or personnel
</p>
<p>7 What is the condition of each major asset
</p>
<p>8 Are reliability or availability issues significant
</p>
<p>9 How much longer can specific assets last
</p>
<p>10 Are there significant risks
</p>
<p>11 Are maintenance costs a significant factor

<p>&bull; Acquisition, development, and implementation
</p>
<p>&bull; Operation, maintenance, and logistic support
</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and review
</p>
<p>&bull; Disposal.
</p>
<p>However, operations and direct maintenance work are not asset management 
</p>
<p>activities.
</p>
<p>2.8.1  Deployed Assets and Asset Fleets
</p>
<p>Deployed assets are those currently in-service with the organization. Deployed 
</p>
<p>assets of a given type can be conveniently referred to as the &ldquo;fleet&rdquo; of that type of 
</p>
<p>asset. A life cycle diagram such as Fig. 2.6 indicates the cycle through which any 
</p>
<p>particular fleet will pass. However, at any given point in time the deployed assets 
</p>
<p>will consist of numerous fleets of assets of different types and these fleets will be 
</p>
<p>at different stages of their life cycles. Asset management activities are required to 
</p>
<p>work across all the asset fleets currently in-service. The whole picture is there-
</p>
<p>fore more complex than may be inferred from considering any particular fleet in 
</p>
<p>isolation.
</p>
<p>The asset management function has a role to play in relation to a substantial 
</p>
<p>number of activities, as shown in Table 2.2 Asset Management Activities. Many of 
</p>
<p>these activities will be considered in detail later in the book.

<p>2.8.2  Capital Items
</p>
<p>Asset acquisition plans are to be created and to be reviewed annually, both for 
</p>
<p>asset replacement and as required in the event of business developments. The age 
</p>
<p>and condition of assets is to be monitored and taken into account in planning, so 
</p>
<p>that issues of reliability and risk, and disruptions to business plans are minimized.
</p>
<p>Capital expenditure (CAPEX) proposals are to be prepared in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the organization&rsquo;s standard procedures and timings, and will include a financial 
</p>
<p>and/or cost&ndash;benefit analysis and a risk analysis.
</p>
<p>2.8.3  In-service Support
</p>
<p>A systematic approach to the support of in-service assets is to be established and 
</p>
<p>operated in accordance with the following requirements:
</p>
<p>Asset maintenance plans, which may include outsourcing, are to be established 
</p>
<p>and to be documented in the organization&rsquo;s maintenance management computer 
</p>
<p>system. Plans will be implemented to deliver the required level of service of 
</p>
<p>assets. Asset maintenance plans are to minimize life cycle costs consistent with 
</p>
<p>achieving the outcomes specified.
</p>
<p>Asset-related operating expenditure (OPEX) proposals are to be prepared in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the organization&rsquo;s standard procedures and timings. Procedures 
</p>
<p>for managing the resulting asset management and maintenance operating budgets 
</p>
<p>are to be established and followed.
</p>
<p>Risk analysis of asset operations is to be undertaken in accordance with speci-
</p>
<p>fied procedures. Risk management and mitigation strategies are to be implemented 
</p>
<p>as indicated by the analysis.
</p>
<p>The specified information management system is to be used for recording 
</p>
<p>plans, procedures, and work management.
</p>
<p>Developments in systems specifications, data structures and applications, such 
</p>
<p>as GPS systems, asset coding, and identification will be undertaken as required.
</p>
<p>Reporting procedures for asset-related incidents, failures, or defects and procedures 
</p>
<p>for the analysis and response to these are to be established and intelligently followed.

<p>36 2 Structure and Activities
</p>
<p>Definitions and reporting procedures for asset performance indicators are to be 
</p>
<p>created, applied, and monitored.
</p>
<p>Other factors to be considered are plans for the longer term; the degree of com-
</p>
<p>mitment to in-house repair and logistic support as opposed to use of outsourced 
</p>
<p>support facilities; the use of redundancy to achieve system reliability rather than 
</p>
<p>seeking high reliability of individual items; the degree of coordination between 
</p>
<p>related parts of a supply chain, e.g., electricity generation, transmission, and dis-
</p>
<p>tribution; maintenance and replacement strategy in regard to run-to-failure, age-
</p>
<p>based, condition-based, spend-limit-based replacement decisions.
</p>
<p>2.9  Asset Management Policy
</p>
<p>A policy statement is a statement of the overall aims or principles adopted by an 
</p>
<p>organization. A policy statement provides high level direction, aimed at guiding 
</p>
<p>the business decision-making process.
</p>
<p>ISO 55001 requires an organization to state an asset management policy.6 The 
</p>
<p>policy is required to provide a basis for setting asset management objectives to 
</p>
<p>include a commitment to meeting asset requirements and a commitment to contin-
</p>
<p>uous improvement. Some suggested general points to be covered in the asset man-
</p>
<p>agement policy statement are shown in Fig. 2.7.
</p>
<p>Other policy principles relate to business governance and practice, and may be 
</p>
<p>in the form of references to other relevant documents. An example is procedures 
</p>
<p>for ensuring a transparent choice of suppliers or service providers. However, we 
</p>
<p>may also specify that interests of logistic support allow selection from a limited 
</p>
<p>range of providers. Another example is that work is to be carried out in accord-
</p>
<p>ance with relevant legislation, standards and guidelines, including health, safety, 
</p>
<p>and environmental protection. Policies in relation to outsourcing and the retention 
</p>
<p>of specific sets of skills within the organization may be established.
</p>
<p>High-level responsibilities may also be established under the Policy heading, 
</p>
<p>for example, the role of the company board in approving and monitoring capital 
</p>
<p>asset acquisition plans and reviewing asset performance.
</p>
<p>2.10  Asset Management Plans
</p>
<p>A major activity of the asset management group is the development of asset man-
</p>
<p>agement plans. ISO 550007 defines an Asset Management Plan as:
</p>
<p>6 ISO 55001 at Clause 5.2 Policy: &ldquo;Top management shall establish an asset management 
policy.&rdquo;
7 ISO 55000 Clause 3.3.3 Asset management plan definition.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>37
</p>
<p>&ldquo;documented information that specifies the activities, resources and timescales 
</p>
<p>required for an individual asset or a grouping of assets, to achieve the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion&rsquo;s asset management objectives.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>An Asset Management Plan is a plan that involves specifying:
</p>
<p>&bull; Activities
</p>
<p>&bull; Resources
</p>
<p>&bull; Timescales
</p>
<p>&bull; Responsibilities
</p>
<p>that are required for the asset or group of assets to achieve specified objectives. 
</p>
<p>Plans are based on the maintenance, repair, overhaul and replacement activities 
</p>
<p>and logistic support needed to sustain the assets and to enable them to deliver the 
</p>
<p>expected level of service over a specified timescale.
</p>
<p>Details of the asset management planning process for individual assets or 
</p>
<p>groups of assets, and for the creation of consolidated, planning-period based, asset 
</p>
<p>management plans across a portfolio of assets are considered in detail in later 
</p>
<p>chapters.

<p>2.11  Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP)
</p>
<p>A Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) is a document which describes how 
</p>
<p>asset management is organized and operated within the organization. ISO 55001 
</p>
<p>states8 that organizations &ldquo;shall develop a SAMP&rdquo;. The SAMP is also referred to 
</p>
<p>in numerous clauses of the standards. The SAMP will be discussed in detail in a 
</p>
<p>later chapter.
</p>
<p>2.12  Policy, Strategy, or Plan?
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; said Jock to his offsider Veronica as they wandered to the water 
</p>
<p>cooler. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between a policy, a strategy and a plan?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Nick. Maybe he can explain it&minus;he&rsquo;s sure to have an opinion, even 
</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; said Veronica.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong, me?&rdquo; said Nick, approaching.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any of your World War 2 stuff,&rdquo; said Veronica.
</p>
<p>Nick thought for a minute.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s try the Punic War,&rdquo; he said.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puny war?&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punic&minus;between the Romans and the Carthaginians around 200 B.C.&rdquo; said 
</p>
<p>Nick.
</p>
<p>Veronica put on a pained expression.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with Policy,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a statement of an overall aim or 
</p>
<p>principle. The Roman policy was stated by Senator Cato, &ldquo;Carthage must be 
</p>
<p>destroyed.&rdquo; An alternative policy might have been for Rome and Carthage to form 
</p>
<p>some kind of Mediterranean Union. But Rome wanted it all, hence the motto mare 
</p>
<p>nostrum.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned you he was a smarty pants,&rdquo; said Veronica. &ldquo;Anyway, how do you 
</p>
<p>know that destroying Carthage was a Policy? It might have been an Objective!&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Fig. 2.8).
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either way, it seems to have worked,&rdquo; said Jock. &ldquo;Where was Carthage anyway?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in North Africa,&rdquo; said Nick.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the Romans had a policy or maybe an objective, but what about a strat-
</p>
<p>egy?&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, had a strategy based on taking his army 
</p>
<p>around Spain and across the Alps into Italy, aiming to defeat the Romans there,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>said Nick.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember the bit about the elephants crossing the Alps,&rdquo; said Jock. &ldquo;I read 
</p>
<p>that the climate must have been warmer in those days, otherwise he would never 
</p>
<p>have made it.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>8 ISO 55001 Clause 4.4.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>39
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Roman general had a different strategy,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;He took his army 
</p>
<p>across the Med. by boat and captured Carthage&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that was the best strategy,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;but what about a Plan?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plan is more a matter of detail. It&rsquo;s about the activities, resources and tim-
</p>
<p>ings needed to put something into practice,&rdquo; said Nick.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;ISO 55000 talks about a Strategic Asset Management Plan,&rdquo; said Veronica, 
</p>
<p>switching to a more current issue, &ldquo;but is it a Strategy or a Plan? What do you 
</p>
<p>reckon?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the guys that wrote this stuff weren&rsquo;t too particular about the dis-
</p>
<p>tinctions,&rdquo; said Jock, leafing through the ISO 55000 documents. &ldquo;Look at this 
</p>
<p>in ISO 55002 Clause 4.1.1.1. &lsquo;NOTE 2: A strategic asset management plan can 
</p>
<p>be referred to by other names, e.g. an asset management strategy&rsquo;. So someone 
</p>
<p>must have thought the SAMP was a strategy and not a plan&hellip;but then, going 
</p>
<p>down another paragraph it says &lsquo;The links between the organizational plan and the 
</p>
<p>Strategic Asset Management Plan should be two-way, and should be developed 
</p>
<p>through an iterative process&rsquo;. That sounds like a plan&mdash;or maybe just a two-way 
</p>
<p>bet!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like we&rsquo;re going to have to live with some flexibility,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;A 
</p>
<p>lot of people just use these terms interchangeably, and any particular document 
</p>
<p>might be a combination of policies, strategies, plans and budgets.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about budgets, there&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; Nick went on. &ldquo;All this strategy 
</p>
<p>and planning is going to depend on there being a budget to actually do something. 
</p>
<p>The overall picture is in Fig. 2.9. We&rsquo;ll see more about the budgeting aspect later 
</p>
<p>in the book.&rdquo;

<p>3.1  Asset Management&mdash;A Matrix Activity
</p>
<p>Asset management is a matrix activity which links with many areas of the business. 
</p>
<p>Asset management involves ongoing liaison with diverse areas and Fig. 3.1 illus-
</p>
<p>trates this. Asset managers need a range of knowledge and communication skills 
</p>
<p>which enable them to deal with these interfaces. They need to combine a signif-
</p>
<p>icant degree of technical equipment knowledge with the ability to communicate

<p>with personnel in other business areas. Important characteristics of good asset 
</p>
<p>managers are a willingness to learn the thought processes of other areas such as 
</p>
<p>finance, information technology and human resource management, and skills in 
</p>
<p>communication, conflict resolution, and dealing with differing cultures and with 
</p>
<p>varying planning horizons. However, operations, finance, engineering design, and 
</p>
<p>the building or installation of plant and equipment are generally not part of the 
</p>
<p>asset management role. The normal running of maintenance and logistics opera-
</p>
<p>tions are also not part of the asset management role, although responsibility for 
</p>
<p>these departments may come under a Chief Asset Manager.

<p>3.1.1  Understanding Needs and Expectations 
</p>
<p>of Stakeholders
</p>
<p>A stakeholder1 is someone with an interest in something. If you have bacon and 
</p>
<p>eggs for breakfast, the chicken is a stakeholder but the pig is committed. In an 
</p>
<p>organization, internal stakeholders are the employees and functional groups such 
</p>
<p>as those indicated in Fig. 3.1. Shareholders and owners are also stakeholders. In 
</p>
<p>the public arena taxpayers are stakeholders, although their influence is indirect. 
</p>
<p>External stakeholders include customers, users, suppliers, contractors, and  regulatory 
</p>
<p>authorities.2
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55000 Clause 3.1.22 gives a definition.

<p>3.1.2  Understanding the Organization and Its Context
</p>
<p>Asset managers require broad knowledge of the external and internal working con-
</p>
<p>text of the organization.3
</p>
<p>3.2  Competence
</p>
<p>Competence is the ability to apply knowledge and skills to achieve intended 
</p>
<p>results.4 The asset management system should specify competency requirements 
</p>
<p>for personnel involved in asset management.5,6 The competency requirements will 
</p>
<p>impact on the recruitment, training, and promotion of persons in the asset manage-
</p>
<p>ment field.
</p>
<p>Asset management needs competencies7 suited to the requirements for 
</p>
<p>knowledge, skills, experience, behavior, attitudes, and attributes related to asset 
</p>
<p>management. The range of required knowledge will involve an understanding of 
</p>
<p>technical areas of the business, the commercial needs of the business, the rele-
</p>
<p>vant suite of asset management techniques, skills in bringing together plans and 
</p>
<p>projects, and in presenting a balanced view of all aspects of an issue as a basis 
</p>
<p>for business case development and decision making. The ability to work in a 
</p>
<p>team and to share, mold, and integrate opinions with logic and objective data are 
</p>
<p>important.
</p>
<p>Members of asset management groups will generally be drawn from techni-
</p>
<p>cal, operational, and service areas and will be people with substantial experience 
</p>
<p>and competence in their earlier roles. Members in specialist roles such as finance, 
</p>
<p>legal, and engineering will combine their specialist knowledge with a thorough 
</p>
<p>grounding in the technical and operational environment of the organization.
</p>
<p>Asset managers will be selected for their combination of equipment knowledge 
</p>
<p>and awareness of business requirements and processes. Equipment knowledge will 
</p>
<p>assist them in identifying developments in their technical field, and assessing their 
</p>
<p>practicality and business value. It is important to recognize and to provide sound 
</p>
<p>responses to both customer pull and technology push.

</p>
<p>3.3  Required Areas of Competence
</p>
<p>Areas of competence required in an asset management group are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Business awareness
</p>
<p>&bull; Demand forecasting
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset requirements planning
</p>
<p>&bull; Financial analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Business case development
</p>
<p>&bull; General technical knowledge
</p>
<p>&bull; Technical knowledge of the specific industry
</p>
<p>&bull; Awareness of developments in the relevant asset types
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisitions management
</p>
<p>&bull; Life cycle planning
</p>
<p>&bull; Logistics
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk management
</p>
<p>&bull; Change management
</p>
<p>&bull; Configuration management
</p>
<p>&bull; Reliability analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance management
</p>
<p>&bull; Project management
</p>
<p>&bull; Communication
</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiation
</p>
<p>&bull; Team work
</p>
<p>&bull; Personnel development.
</p>
<p>Figure 3.2 shows in graphical form the overlapping areas of competence needed 
</p>
<p>by personnel in the asset management field.
</p>
<p>3.3.1  Filling the Gaps
</p>
<p>Guidelines for the development of an asset management-related competency man-
</p>
<p>agement system are given in ISO 55002 at Clause 7.2.8 Unlike many other areas of 
</p>
<p>business, there is not an obvious direct educational feed-in to the asset manage-
</p>
<p>ment area. Entrants to asset management cannot normally be expected to have 
</p>
<p>strong competencies across all areas at the outset, and training and education are 
</p>
<p>required to assist development over a period.
</p>
<p>The most common route is for asset managers to be recruited from persons 
</p>
<p>with the basic technical knowledge of the industry, either from an engineering or 
</p>
<p>maintenance source. The need for people skills, means that those who naturally 
</p>
<p>are good communicators will be likely to succeed as asset managers.
</p>
<p>8 ISO 55002 at Clause 7.2.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>47
</p>
<p>This then means that education and training are required in the areas of business 
</p>
<p>finance, in business case development and budgeting, and in asset management 
</p>
<p>specific techniques such as acquisition project development, change manage-
</p>
<p>ment, life cycle asset planning, logistics of asset support and in risk, contingency, 
</p>
<p> reliability, and maintenance systems.
</p>
<p>3.4  Key Activities Where Competence Is Needed
</p>
<p>Specific tasks where particular competence is needed include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Development of asset management plans and interface with business plans
</p>
<p>&bull; Business case development for improvements and problem solving
</p>
<p>&bull; Preparing CAPEX and OPEX proposals&mdash;avoiding the asset death spiral
</p>
<p>&bull; Management of acquisitions and related change
</p>
<p>&bull; Stakeholder liaison
</p>
<p>&bull; Managing the maintenance interface, including resource provision, asset condi-
</p>
<p>tion assessment, and repair/replace decisions
</p>
<p>&bull; Reliability and root cause analysis

<p>48 3 Asset Management Personnel
</p>
<p>3.5  Roles, Responsibilities and Authorities9
</p>
<p>The following are key personnel roles in asset management. The assignment of 
</p>
<p>persons to these roles will depend on the size and structure of the organization, 
</p>
<p>and the existence of a role does not necessarily imply that that role constitutes a 
</p>
<p>full time job.
</p>
<p>Chief Asset Manager
</p>
<p>The Chief Asset Manager plays a key role in asset-related decisions and activities. 
</p>
<p>This includes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Participation in business development planning to ensure that the asset implica-
</p>
<p>tions of the organization&rsquo;s business objectives and plans are understood by sen-
</p>
<p>ior management and that the corresponding asset requirements are incorporated 
</p>
<p>into all business plans.
</p>
<p>&bull; Developing plans and financial proposals for asset-related capital and operating 
</p>
<p>expenditure, both for new assets and for the sustainment of existing assets.
</p>
<p>&bull; Taking responsibility for the many activities that assets require in an asset inten-
</p>
<p>sive organization&mdash;as represented in the Strategic Asset Management Plan 
</p>
<p>(SAMP).
</p>
<p>This role requires a combination of technical, financial, and personal communica-
</p>
<p>tion abilities.
</p>
<p>Asset Manager
</p>
<p>Below the level of the Chief Asset Manager there will be asset managers involved 
</p>
<p>with particular ranges of assets. For example, in an electricity transmission organi-
</p>
<p>zation there are asset managers for Switchgear, Transformers, and Secondary 
</p>
<p>Systems within the substation asset group. Asset Managers require knowledge of 
</p>
<p>relevant technologies and their operational context. They provide management 
</p>
<p>and leadership for the group, and also provide input into business development 
</p>
<p>in relation to their technical area. This includes replacement planning, budgeting, 
</p>
<p>and analysis related to equipment utilization, reliability, maintenance, and support 
</p>
<p>policy.
</p>
<p>Asset managers are likely to come from engineering or logistic backgrounds, 
</p>
<p>but they need to be familiar with the business in its broader context, and with gen-
</p>
<p>eral accounting and financial concepts. While the ultimate detail of accounting 
</p>
<p>and finance will remain the province of specialists in those areas, most business 
</p>
<p>decisions are based on estimates or forecasts made from the basis of combined 
</p>
<p>technical and business knowledge. Here, asset managers have a key role to play 
</p>
<p>in providing timely and sound input into business decisions. A company with a 
</p>
<p>9 ISO 55001 Clause 7. Support, 7.1 Resources: &ldquo;The organization shall determine and provide 
the resources needed for&hellip; the asset management system.&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>49
</p>
<p>strong asset management presence is likely to outperform one where asset man-
</p>
<p>agement is weak or nonexistent, and it is particularly important that asset manag-
</p>
<p>ers can provide a  working link between the technical and the financial elements of 
</p>
<p>the organization.
</p>
<p>Project Manager
</p>
<p>Project Managers&mdash;Acquisitions
</p>
<p>Project managers&mdash;Sustainment
</p>
<p>Acquisition and development projects constitute a major activity of the asset man-
</p>
<p>agement function.
</p>
<p>Project managers are typically trained and certified in relation to the require-
</p>
<p>ments of professional organizations such as the Project Management Institute and 
</p>
<p>the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK).
</p>
<p>Finance, accounting and costing
</p>
<p>Personnel in these fields play an important role in assessing costs, assessing 
</p>
<p>the financial viability of projects, and in managing the finances of projects in 
</p>
<p>progress.
</p>
<p>Engineers
</p>
<p>Engineers are required to provide detailed technical knowledge essential to deci-
</p>
<p>sions relating to the organization&rsquo;s assets. This includes knowledge of design 
</p>
<p>and operation, and engineering and data analysis skills in reliability, mainte-
</p>
<p>nance, and through life support and replacement decisions. Engineers may take 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;subject matter expert&rdquo; roles which run across an organization. For example, an 
</p>
<p>expert on draglines may advise on technical and asset-related decisions across a 
</p>
<p>range of sites.
</p>
<p>Logisticians
</p>
<p>Asset management is a mainstream area for the logistics specialist. The work 
</p>
<p>involves applying such techniques as logistic support analysis and level of repair 
</p>
<p>analysis. This activity area extends into configuration management, cataloging 
</p>
<p>of spares, identification and coding of maintainable items of equipment, setting 
</p>
<p>inventory control parameters, and ensuring that the distribution system for assets, 
</p>
<p>consumables, and spare parts is appropriate to needs. A mining company once 
</p>
<p>purchased a vehicle to work underground but then found that it was too big to be 
</p>
<p>taken down the shaft. Roles are summarized in Fig. 3.3.
</p>
<p>Technical Support Specialists
</p>
<p>Lawyers Contracting and contract managers.
</p>
<p>Procurement managers and officers
</p>
<p>General staff are also required covering clerical and administrative functions.

</p>
<p>3.7  Personnel Development System
</p>
<p>A competency development and recording system10 is needed in order to manage 
</p>
<p>the competency of personnel. Topics to be covered include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of required competencies.
</p>
<p>&bull; Development or identification of training and educational courses.

<p>&bull; Qualifications;
</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrated understanding; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrated experience;
</p>
<p>Getting the right people into the right positions in asset management involves rec-
</p>
<p>ognizing the competencies that are needed and recruiting, selecting, and devel-
</p>
<p>oping people to deliver these competencies. For any particular appointment it 
</p>
<p>is useful to identify the main competencies needed and then assess individuals 
</p>
<p>against this. A simple rating system for any competency is:

<p>A spider diagram helps in visualizing and presenting the competencies required 
</p>
<p>for a particular post, and the competency status which has been assessed for a 
</p>
<p>particular candidate. This approach is illustrated in Fig. 3.4 which is a spider dia-
</p>
<p>gram relating to the position of Asset Manager. This can assist with decisions on 
</p>
<p>appointments, and also identify where individuals would benefit from additional 
</p>
<p>training and experience.
</p>
<p>Grander terms for the level of competency are: 1 = Foundation, 2 = Professional, 
</p>
<p>and 3 = Mastery.
</p>
<p>3.9  Leadership11
</p>
<p>Leadership is an important factor in effective asset management. The asset man-
</p>
<p>agement function must be represented at a sufficiently senior level in the organi-
</p>
<p>zation if adequate leadership in the asset management field is to be achieved. 
</p>
<p>Without this leadership, business plans can fail due to inadequate or inappropriate 
</p>
<p>asset provision or support. The existence of a Chief Asset Manager, or equivalent 
</p>
<p>representation at Chief or Vice-President level, is important in this regard.

<p>54 3 Asset Management Personnel
</p>
<p>A primary element in leadership in asset management is the ability to combine 
</p>
<p>an understanding of the business objectives with an understanding of the role of 
</p>
<p>physical assets in meeting those objectives. This is the starting point for ensuring 
</p>
<p>that the business objectives and the asset management plans are aligned. This must 
</p>
<p>then be followed up by appropriate asset provision, asset support, and resources 
</p>
<p>for the sustainment of an effective asset management system.
</p>
<p>Leadership also plays a key role in establishing a positive workplace culture. 
</p>
<p>This means extending from a sound practical system of asset provision and sup-
</p>
<p>port, into encouraging active participation of all levels of staff in establishing a 
</p>
<p>culture which respects safety, reliability, and cost effective operation.12
</p>
<p>More generally, though, leadership is not necessarily the same as good direc-
</p>
<p>tion, so do not get led astray.
</p>
<p>3.9.1  Communication and Response13
</p>
<p>Ongoing systems should be established for communication between management, 
</p>
<p>employees, customers, suppliers, and stakeholders in regard to asset management 
</p>
<p>issues and developments. In this way, asset knowledge will be developed, dissemi-
</p>
<p>nated, and retained.
</p>
<p>Communication must be two-way. It is highly important that good communi-
</p>
<p>cations are established with employees in regard to feedback from operating and 
</p>
<p>maintenance levels, as this is where the first indications of asset-related problems 
</p>
<p>often come to light. Problems must not be swept under the carpet due to laziness 
</p>
<p>or fear of retribution. Staff should be given time and encouragement to refer prob-
</p>
<p>lems upward so that they may be acted upon. This includes respect for minority 
</p>
<p>opinions and giving priority to bad news. If senior staff are ignorant of, or choose 
</p>
<p>to ignore significant problems, respect will be lost and the workplace culture will 
</p>
<p>deteriorate.
</p>
<p>One day I saw a loose nut lying on the floor of my garage. No one else was 
</p>
<p>going to do anything about it, so I checked to see where it had come from. I found 
</p>
<p>that it was from the motor that drove the automatic door and that the motor was 
</p>
<p>loose on its bearers. I replaced the nut and checked and tightened the other ones. 
</p>
<p>In a working situation I might have ignored the nut, or even kicked it under a pile 
</p>
<p>of wood&mdash;a reaction known jokingly as &ldquo;industrial blindness,&rdquo; which occurs where 
</p>
<p>actual and potential failings are routinely ignored because no one seems to care.
</p>
<p>Specific techniques which form a basis for good communication about assets 
</p>
<p>are Failure Recording and Corrective Action Systems (FRACAS) and the use 
</p>
<p>of regular tool box meetings involving operations and maintenance staff and 
</p>
<p>12 J.R. Lafraia and J. Hardwick, Living Asset Management. ISBN 978 1 922107 25 1.
13 ISO 55001/2 Clause 7.4 Communication: &ldquo;The organization shall determine the need for&hellip; 
communications &hellip;what&hellip;when&hellip;with whom&hellip;how.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

</p>
<p>supervisors. It is important that feedback from the workplace penetrates to higher 
</p>
<p>levels of management where there is sufficient financial authority to address prob-
</p>
<p>lems. Managers should understand the effect on business operations of shortcom-
</p>
<p>ings in asset performance and condition. It is important that any adverse findings 
</p>
<p>are acted upon and not merely shelved.
</p>
<p>The film, &ldquo;The Caine Mutiny&rdquo; dramatizes the difference between two ships&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>captains. The first had good communication and rapport with his crew. He took 
</p>
<p>note of suggestions and delivered a positive response or explanation. As a result 
</p>
<p>the crew responded with good performance. His successor was a martinet whose 
</p>
<p>reaction was to punish mistakes or delays, but not to listen to reasons why. The 
</p>
<p>eventual result was a mutiny when conditions became tough.

<p>3.11  Asset Management&mdash;Who Needs It?
</p>
<p>Every few weeks Jock would call in on his Pop at his old weatherboard house near 
</p>
<p>the Yarra river at Warrandyte. Pop barracked for Richmond, unlike Jock who was 
</p>
<p>a Brisbane Lions supporter. Pop also went along to the local oval every week to 
</p>
<p>watch his youngest great-grandchild play for the Warrandyte Bloods in the local 
</p>
<p>under 12 s league. After the usual football banter, Jock told Pop about his new job.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean asset management?&rdquo; asked Pop. Jock explained.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could have done with some of that in the early days of the war,&rdquo; said Pop. 
</p>
<p>Jock liked to hear Pop&rsquo;s stories and waited for him to go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Norway was a disaster,&rdquo; said Pop. &ldquo;We were supposed to block the German 
</p>
<p>advance but we were landed without any of our stuff. We were sitting on a hillside 
</p>
<p>with just our packs and rifles when an officer told us to start digging in. He didn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>stick around so we just took a couple of casual kicks at the rocks and sat down 
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>Then my mate Happy Kershaw noticed a plane in the distance, and said that it 
</p>
<p>was coming our way. Happy stood up and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s dropping something.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>We watched idly as the something fell to the ground, and then jumped a mile 
</p>
<p>as it gave an almighty bang. Realization dawned, as the plane veered away and we 
</p>
<p>could see black crosses on its wings. After that we lay flat, and dug furiously with 
</p>
<p>our bayonets and bare hands.
</p>
<p>Later that night we were pulled back and shipped out on a destroyer, but all our 
</p>
<p>gear was lost. Someone must have learnt a lot about logistics from that little epi-
</p>
<p>sode,&rdquo; said Pop.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe the asset development process 
</p>
<p>from concept to project approval. This chapter shows how asset management 
</p>
<p>works with other parts of the organization in order to create sound development 
</p>
<p>plans. The focus is on procedures for larger scale developments, such as major 
</p>
<p>acquisitions. The chapter starts at the concept level, goes through the preliminary 
</p>
<p>approval stage, to feasibility planning and on to final project approval. Outcomes 
</p>
<p>After reading this chapter you will know about:
</p>
<p>&bull; The stages involved in asset development;
</p>
<p>&bull; The structure and role of development planning teams;
</p>
<p>&bull; The concept of capability, with examples;
</p>
<p>&bull; The identification of business needs;
</p>
<p>&bull; The concept of capability gap analysis, the development of a capability require-
</p>
<p>ments statement and an operational concept;
</p>
<p>&bull; Prefeasibility analysis of development options, leading to a proposal at the pre-
</p>
<p>liminary approval stage;
</p>
<p>&bull; Feasibility analysis and the creation of an acquisition or development plan.

<p>4.1  Project Initiation
</p>
<p>Business development generally involves a senior level group which identifies 
</p>
<p>business development needs and examines options for meeting those needs. This 
</p>
<p>involves establishing priorities, assessing financial returns, assessing sources of 
</p>
<p>funding and possible constraints. If an option appears favorable, the development

</p>
<p>group will initiate a major development project. The rationale behind asset inten-
</p>
<p>sive projects may be one or more of the following:
</p>
<p> a. Capacity creation, expansion, reduction, or consolidation
</p>
<p> b. Process cost reduction
</p>
<p> c. New or improved business opportunities or directions
</p>
<p> d. Renewal or updating of existing capacity
</p>
<p> e. Process improvement in yield or quality
</p>
<p> f. De-bottlenecking
</p>
<p> g. Protection of assets
</p>
<p> h. Technical developments, internally and externally
</p>
<p> i. Environmental or safety improvements
</p>
<p> j. Response to regulatory changes.
</p>
<p>Development ideas may have a top-down or a bottom-up origin. A top-down devel-
</p>
<p>opment will originate with senior management. A bottom-up development will 
</p>
<p>start in the operations areas rising through the hierarchy and then feeding into the 
</p>
<p>business development process. The organization should encourage business devel-
</p>
<p>opment from the bottom-up as well as from the top-down. Workplace personnel 
</p>
<p>and managers close to the workface are in an excellent position to see how 
</p>
<p>improvements can be made, often on a very cost-effective basis. They should be 
</p>
<p>encouraged to develop and bring forward proposals in a spirit of continuous 
</p>
<p>improvement.1
</p>
<p>For a concept to proceed into the mainstream of development planning, the 
</p>
<p>backing of senior management must be achieved. A project initiation budget needs 
</p>
<p>to be set aside, and procedures established, for the purpose of getting ideas to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;square one&rdquo; of the development process.
</p>
<p>4.2  Types of Acquisition or Development
</p>
<p>Several different types of asset acquisition or development processes can be 
</p>
<p>identified as follows:
</p>
<p>a. Off-the-shelf acquisition
</p>
<p>b. Business development but not primarily acquisition
</p>
<p>c. Design incorporating selection of off-the-shelf items
</p>
<p>d. Design from the drawing board but standard technology
</p>
<p>e. Introduction of technical change
</p>
<p>f. Design with developmental technology
</p>
<p>g. Research and development.
</p>
<p>An off-the-shelf acquisition is one where we acquire an existing product, with 
</p>
<p>no design or modification involved. With off-the-shelf acquisitions the logistic 
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55002 Clause 10.3.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>63
</p>
<p>support requirements should be readily met and often are available as a standard 
</p>
<p>part of the acquisition package. As we proceed down the above list, the level of 
</p>
<p>complexity increases and so does the risk in the project. Businesses should be 
</p>
<p>wary of projects that involve significant amounts of development work as they 
</p>
<p>often lead to technical problems and delays. In such cases it is best to undertake a 
</p>
<p>pilot project initially to eliminate as many unknown factors as possible.
</p>
<p>4.3  Business Development Planning
</p>
<p>Business development is a key role of senior management. Development planning 
</p>
<p>requires confidentiality, as plans are discussed which may influence the overall 
</p>
<p>direction of the business, but which are still in a state of flux. A business develop-
</p>
<p>ment group is normally established to generate, assess, and monitor major potential 
</p>
<p>developments. In looking to the future, the business development group will need to 
</p>
<p>draw on specific asset knowledge and in this situation the existence of a recognized 
</p>
<p>asset management group with the necessary knowledge and skills is an advantage.
</p>
<p>4.3.1  Major Projects
</p>
<p>An example of a major strategic development decision is a commitment to develop 
</p>
<p>a new mine. For example, a mining company may be considering developing a 
</p>
<p>mine which will produce particular mineral, say nickel. A decision as to whether 
</p>
<p>to proceed with the development of the mine will depend on an assessment of the 
</p>
<p>current and future demand for and forecast price of nickel, the development cost of 
</p>
<p>the mine, the production cost per tonne, the likely yield and other factors such as 
</p>
<p>transport costs, energy costs, and regulatory issues.
</p>
<p>Once a concept takes on the aspect of a major project, which usually means 
</p>
<p>exceeding some financial threshold of the order of tens of millions of dollars, a 
</p>
<p>development planning team will be formed. The asset management group, or 
</p>
<p>equivalent, will play a key role here, particularly in regard to the asset acquisition 
</p>
<p>and sustainment aspects of the project.
</p>
<p>The stages of development of a major project are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Project initiation
</p>
<p>&bull; Capability requirements analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Prefeasibility analysis&mdash;identify options
</p>
<p>&bull; Feasibility analysis&mdash;detailed plan
</p>
<p>&bull; Project approval
</p>
<p>&bull; Implementation.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.14 Steps in the Asset Management Process, provides more detail of the 
</p>
<p>steps involved in a major asset development project, and the subsequent sustain-
</p>
<p>ment of the asset in-service.
</p>
<p>4.2 Types of Acquisition or Development</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>64 4 From Concept to Project Approval
</p>
<p>4.3.2  Minor Projects
</p>
<p>Minor projects play an important role in supporting and developing business 
</p>
<p>performance. These developments may be handled within operating divisions and 
</p>
<p>often form part of existing job activities rather than giving rise to specially formed 
</p>
<p>teams. The logic of the steps involved in appraisal and implementation is much 
</p>
<p>the same in both major and minor cases, but the volume of work is less in a simple 
</p>
<p>acquisition or a development with modest logistic support needs.
</p>
<p>4.3.3  Developmental Flexibility
</p>
<p>In this chapter we describe processes for the assessment of business needs and 
</p>
<p>the determination of asset requirements. In practice, our processes must not delay 
</p>
<p>acquisition or development unnecessarily. Where the business justification is clear 
</p>
<p>and the needs can be met by well-recognized steps, then our organization should 
</p>
<p>be such that we can proceed without delay.
</p>
<p>In a warehousing operation, for example, if additional forklift capacity of a 
</p>
<p>standard type is needed, a rapid and favorable assessment of the factors involved 
</p>
<p>should result in the acquisition of an additional machine within days. On the 
</p>
<p>other hand, the development of a new warehouse site would involve a detailed 
</p>
<p>analysis of issues such as future demand, site availability, site access, materials 
</p>
<p>handling, and personnel requirements for operations and support. The extent of 
</p>
<p>our deliberations, in terms of detail and time, should reflect the level of complexity 
</p>
<p>and degree of urgency of the business need, and the acquisition or development 
</p>
<p>process should adapt accordingly.
</p>
<p>4.3.4  Delegation of Financial Authority
</p>
<p>The organization should encourage business development from the bottom-up as 
</p>
<p>well as from the top-down. Workplace personnel and managers close to the work-
</p>
<p>face are in an excellent position to see how improvements can be made, often on 
</p>
<p>a very cost-effective basis. To take advantage of this there should be delegation of 
</p>
<p>financial authority to intermediate and lower management levels. In addition, it is 
</p>
<p>desirable to provide a budget for unforeseen events or contingencies.
</p>
<p>Minor projects can form a basis for addressing problems or initiating develop-
</p>
<p>ment ideas which are then evaluated. The results will form a basis for expanding 
</p>
<p>on or alternatively abandoning an idea. Adequate local financial discretion will 
</p>
<p>tend to avoid the asset death spiral. An example of guidelines for financial delega-
</p>
<p>tion within a company is shown in Table 4.1. The &ldquo;Unforeseen&rdquo; category is a con-
</p>
<p>tingency budget enabling managers to react quickly to unforeseen events.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>65
</p>
<p>4.4  Capability
</p>
<p>An important concept in business development planning and in asset management 
</p>
<p>generally is capability. Capability is the ability of a system to meet a specified 
</p>
<p>need in all its aspects. That is, it covers the combined concepts of capacity and 
</p>
<p>ability, including all the assets and associated personnel, resources and services 
</p>
<p>which are required to meet the need. It is essential that those involved in business 
</p>
<p>development planning understand the concept of capability, as otherwise they will 
</p>
<p>not take a sufficiently comprehensive view of all aspects of a development.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the meaning of &ldquo;capability&rdquo; consider the example of a fire station. 
</p>
<p>The primary assets are the fire engine or engines and the building which houses 
</p>
<p>them. However, the total capability required, goes beyond these primary assets. 
</p>
<p>There is a need for provision and storage of a range of firefighting and fire pro-
</p>
<p>tection equipment, basic medical equipment and supplies, control and communi-
</p>
<p>cations equipment, office space and equipment, electricity and water supplies, 
</p>
<p>transport access roads and parking space, short term food supplies, the provision of 
</p>
<p>training rooms and training facilities, the availability of personnel to staff the facil-
</p>
<p>ity, and planning, and training for operations and maintenance. These elements in 
</p>
<p>total comprise the firefighting capability which is needed. Figure 4.1 summarizes

<p>this. In addition to the basic list of items, technical specifications will also be 
</p>
<p>needed, such as the quantity, capacity, or level of service. The key point here is to 
</p>
<p>be aware of the extensive range of items which typically constitute a capability.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.2 illustrates the types of inputs to asset capability in a general case.
</p>
<p>4.5  Capability Requirements Planning
</p>
<p>Capability Requirements Panning is the determination of the capability 
</p>
<p>requirements needed in order to support a planned business activity over a planning 
</p>
<p>horizon. Figure 4.3 indicates the steps in capability requirements planning.
</p>
<p>Capability requirements planning starts with demand analysis, that is, an 
</p>
<p>assessment of the demand for a product or service, originating from the customers, 
</p>

</p>
<p>users, or stakeholders. Based on this demand, a business plan is developed. We 
</p>
<p>then proceed into a needs analysis. A needs analysis is an assessment of the total 
</p>
<p>capability required to support the business plan. An example is where the growth 
</p>
<p>or reduction in demand for electricity, leads to a plan to expand or reduce the sup-
</p>
<p>ply. This leads to an estimate of the generating capacity, transmission capacity 
</p>
<p>(i.e., high voltage lines), and distribution capacity (i.e., local supply lines) needed 
</p>
<p>at various geographical points over the planning horizon.
</p>
<p>The next step is a projection of the un-augmented asset capability. This is the 
</p>
<p>available capability, projected over the planning horizon, if no new development 
</p>
<p>is undertaken. To assess this we start from the existing capability and project for-
</p>
<p>ward, taking into account all factors which will deplete this capability, such as the 
</p>
<p>retirement of old plant, the impact of technical and regulatory changes and also 
</p>
<p>any augmentation from the coming to fruition of existing committed plans. In this 
</p>
<p>step we do not consider the addition of new capability which has not yet been 
</p>
<p>approved. The result will be a projected available level of generating, transmis-
</p>
<p>sion, and distribution capacity going forward in time.
</p>
<p>The next step is capability gap analysis, where we identify the gap between the 
</p>
<p>required capability and the projected un-augmented capability. This analysis will 
</p>
<p>indicate a capability gap moving forward in time. In the electricity generating case 
</p>
<p>the gap will be in megawatts of generating capacity and may also reflect legisla-
</p>
<p>tion on the source of energy.
</p>
<p>From the capability gap analysis we construct a capability requirements state-
</p>
<p>ment, which is a statement of the capability which we need to acquire to fill the 
</p>
<p>gap. This statement will address both the quantity and type of capability required, 
</p>
<p>the timings required, and issues such as level of service, essential criteria, and 
</p>
<p>desirable criteria.
</p>
<p>The capability requirements statement will form the starting point for the 
</p>
<p>creation of a development plan which will deliver the capability necessary to 
</p>
<p>support the business plan.
</p>
<p>4.5.1  Development Planning Teams
</p>
<p>The senior management of the organization will exercise a review function 
</p>
<p>which will include an initial assessment of major development proposals. 
</p>
<p>When a major proposal is seen as having potential it will become part of the 
</p>
<p>Requirements Portfolio of projects and a development planning team will be 
</p>
<p>formed. A development planning team is a group of people whose job is to plan 
</p>
<p>the development.
</p>
<p>Development planning teams will appear in the organizational chart as shown 
</p>
<p>in Fig. 4.4 and will report to a development manager. They will draw on person-
</p>
<p>nel from the Business Development Group, on the user area most involved in the 
</p>
<p>development, and on asset management personnel with skills in the development 
</p>
<p>area. Key stakeholders will be identified and brought in as required. The team will 
</p>

<p>68 4 From Concept to Project Approval
</p>
<p>report to the head of business development, and through him, to the board of the 
</p>
<p>company.
</p>
<p>For large projects, subsidiary working groups may be established to deal with 
</p>
<p>specific issues. If necessary, a separate exploratory or trials stage will be estab-
</p>
<p>lished. It is better to put in the effort at the early stages of a development than to 
</p>
<p>rush into a project which later turns out to be technically or financially unsound, 
</p>
<p>though in any case there is always an element of risk remaining.
</p>
<p>Some asset-based businesses involve a continual succession of projects, such as 
</p>
<p>small- or medium-sized building or equipment renewal projects, and they will be 
</p>
<p>organized to deal with this routinely. The organization of each project will depend 
</p>
<p>on its size and complexity. For smaller projects, the development will take place 
</p>
<p>within the relevant operational area.
</p>

</p>
<p>An underlying factor in development planning is forecasting future demand for the 
</p>
<p>product or service. Forecasting is a general business challenge, but current asset 
</p>
<p>knowledge and related technical knowledge make asset managers important con-
</p>
<p>tributors to the forecasting process. The simplest cases involve an extrapolation of 
</p>
<p>current demand, for example, increasing demand for infrastructure and services in 
</p>
<p>areas of urban growth. Harder to predict are the effects and speed of technologi-
</p>
<p>cal change and the actions of governments which can radically and unpredictably 
</p>
<p>intervene in markets and influence the pattern of demand.
</p>
<p>In the forecasting process we consider the following aspects for a given product 
</p>
<p>or service:
</p>
<p>&bull; Level. What is the existing level of demand?
</p>
<p>&bull; Trend existing. Is the level of demand currently rising, falling, or remaining steady?
</p>
<p>&bull; Trend forecast. Are there market or technological factors that can affect trend in 
</p>
<p>the planning period, and if so, in what direction?
</p>
<p>&bull; Seasonality. Are there seasonal or other cyclic factors that affect demand?
</p>
<p>&bull; One-Offs. Are there one-off or rare events which need to be allowed for?
</p>
<p>&bull; Outliers. These are past events which may need to be considered separately, for 
</p>
<p>example, a flood, storm, or fire which may or may not recur.
</p>
<p>However good the forecast, unforeseen changes can occur. For this reason, an 
</p>
<p>important consideration is flexibility. Asset options which facilitate flexible 
</p>
<p>responses to change are often better than longer term fixed commitments.
</p>
<p>4.5.3  Demand Management
</p>
<p>Demand management is the use of techniques which influence the demand for a 
</p>
<p>product or service, in contrast to planning to meet the &ldquo;unmanaged&rdquo; demand. An 
</p>
<p>example is to have a suitable pricing policy. The provision of a nominally free or 
</p>
<p>heavily subsidized service of some type, such as public transport, can result in 
</p>
<p>excessive levels of demand on the one hand, or in the provision of services that 
</p>
<p>few people use. A guideline is to avoid subsidies, as the fact that there is no such 
</p>
<p>thing as a free lunch will then combine with Adam Smith&rsquo;s invisible hands to 
</p>
<p>produce a manageable and sustainable result. Sure thing!
</p>
<p>4.5.4  Needs Analysis
</p>
<p>Needs analysis is the identification of what the organization needs in terms of asset 
</p>
<p>capability in order to support its business plans. Initially, needs analysis works at 
</p>
<p>the level of prime equipment and takes a broad view of business development. Any 
</p>
<p>actual development requires a more detailed consideration of the factors involved 
</p>
<p>in achieving and delivering a capability.
</p>
<p>4.5 Capability Requirements Planning</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>70 4 From Concept to Project Approval
</p>
<p>Needs analysis looks at several time frames on a rolling basis, such as 
</p>
<p>0&ndash;5 years, 5&ndash;10 years, 10&ndash;20 years. Analysts consider likely scenarios and 
</p>
<p>responses to those scenarios, and identify the capability needs of the organization 
</p>
<p>over the corresponding periods. This requires a good understanding of how 
</p>
<p>business functional requirements convert into asset capability requirements.
</p>
<p>Given a demand forecast, Fig. 4.6 schematically illustrates the principles 
</p>
<p>of needs analysis at a simple level. The dashed line shows a projected increase 
</p>
<p>in demand for a product or service. The dotted line shows the projected level of 
</p>
<p>capacity needed in order to meet the demand, allowing for some spare capacity to 
</p>
<p>accommodate variability and risk.
</p>
<p>4.5.5  Un-augmented Capability Analysis
</p>
<p>The next step in capability requirements planning is to assess what the capability 
</p>
<p>will be over the planning horizon if no augmentation is carried out. We estimate 
</p>
<p>the decrease in our production or service capacity if no acquisitions are made. 
</p>
<p>Primarily, this decrease will be due to older equipment being retired or becom-
</p>
<p>ing obsolete. In Fig. 4.7 the light solid line, labeled &ldquo;Capacity if no Acquisitions&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>shows the projection of the un-augmented capacity.
</p>
<p>4.5.5.1  Remaining Life and Retirement Schedule
</p>
<p>In assessing the un-augmented capability we consider the retirement of exist-
</p>
<p>ing assets as they age. For capability requirements planning purposes we also 
</p>
<p>need to consider the lead time required in order to replace them, whether as a 
</p>
<p>direct replacement or as part of an alternative solution. Planning decisions must 
</p>
<p>be made in sufficient time to allow for the lead time activities of the acquisition 
</p>
<p>process.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>71
</p>
<p>Details of this type of planning process is considered in Chap. 7&mdash;Asset 
</p>
<p>Continuity Planning. At this stage we need to be aware that a retirement schedule 
</p>
<p>has to be created for existing assets and that this will provide input into the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;un-augmented capability&rdquo; part of the needs analysis.
</p>
<p>4.5.6  Capability Gap
</p>
<p>The capability gap is the gap, projected forward over the planning horizon, 
</p>
<p>between:
</p>
<p>a. The capability that we need.
</p>
<p>b. The un-augmented capability.
</p>
<p>The gap may be positive or negative, that is to say, there may be a shortage of 
</p>
<p>capability or an oversupply. The gap is the driver for new capability or, in the case 
</p>
<p>of excess, for the disposal or reallocation of resources.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.7 illustrates the capability gap, but for simplicity it is shown only as a 
</p>
<p>single, or prime equipment, capacity level. The light solid line, labeled &ldquo;Capacity 
</p>
<p>if no Acquisitions&rdquo; shows the projection of the un-augmented capacity. The gap 
</p>
<p>between the capacity needed and the un-augmented capacity is the capacity gap. 
</p>
<p>We may also refer to this gap as the preplan capacity gap, since it represents the 
</p>
<p>situation before any plans to fill the gap are introduced. In practice we would 
</p>
<p>consider a prime equipment capacity gap initially and then follow up with a 
</p>
<p>consideration of the related subsidiary items of the capability. The gap will vary 
</p>
<p>through time, in this case increasing as demand rises and un-augmented capacity 
</p>
<p>falls. It is important to project the gap forward on the basis of the un-augmented 
</p>
<p>capability, otherwise a lack of appreciation of the variations in the gap over the 
</p>
<p>planning horizon can lead to the development of inferior capability plans. In some 
</p>
<p>instances the gap may rise and then fall, suggesting that the company should plan to 
</p>
<p>cope with a temporary rise which is quite different to dealing with a permanent one.

<p>72 4 From Concept to Project Approval
</p>
<p>4.5.7  Capability Requirements Statement
</p>
<p>Having completed the capability gap analysis, the development team prepares a 
</p>
<p>capability requirements statement. This statement identifies the capabilities which 
</p>
<p>are required to fill the capability gaps. The capability requirements statement 
</p>
<p>forms a basis for further analysis and refinement toward a development plan. 
</p>
<p>The statement must provide sufficient information to act as a starting point for 
</p>
<p>subsequent development analysis, and take account of the financial aspects of the 
</p>
<p>decisions, but great precision is not expected at this stage.
</p>
<p>For example, a capability requirements statement may specify that a company 
</p>
<p>will require trucks with sufficient capacity to move a specified volume of goods 
</p>
<p>over specified routes, and logistic support for those trucks. The statement will 
</p>
<p>also specify factors of timing and cost based on stated market expectations. The 
</p>
<p>capability requirements statement will also specify decision criteria that any 
</p>
<p>feasible plan should meet. Some of the criteria will be deemed to be essential, 
</p>
<p>such as the ability to move a given volume of goods, and the ability to meet certain 
</p>
<p>design regulations, whereas other may be desirable, for example, a requirement 
</p>
<p>relating to fuel consumption.
</p>
<p>4.6  Value Engineering
</p>
<p>Value engineering is a systematic process of reviewing any acquisition proposal to see 
</p>
<p>how it might be achieved in a cost-effective manner. It can be applied to the capability 
</p>
<p>defined in the Capability Requirements Statement, or at other stages of an acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion process. It involves asking a series of questions which in practice often lead to 
</p>
<p>cost reductions, logistic support savings, or design improvements. At the same time 
</p>
<p>we must avoid a &ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish&rdquo; approach, which may make short-term 
</p>
<p>savings but cause longer term expense, and compromise the aims of the development.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.8 provides a checklist of questions typical of value engineering.
</p>
<p>Questions Comments
</p>
<p>Can the function or equipment be eliminated
</p>
<p>Can the function be achieved in another way
</p>
<p>Is there a cheaper alternative
</p>
<p>Are all the features of the equipment required
</p>
<p>Is the capacity greater than necessary
</p>
<p>Can cheaper materials be used
</p>
<p>Can parts be standardized
</p>
<p>Are the finishes specified essential
</p>
<p>Can installation time be reduced by design changes
</p>
<p>Can energy consumption be reduced
</p>
<p>Can maintenance costs be reduced
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>73
</p>
<p>4.6.1  Value for Money
</p>
<p>A related concept is the need to provide value for money, that is, not to spend money 
</p>
<p>unnecessarily on items or features that are not essential. This may be obvious to the 
</p>
<p>person who provides the money, but needs to be emphasized in situations where the 
</p>
<p>purchaser is remote from the funder, for example, in public sector purchases.
</p>
<p>4.7  Creating the Development Plan2
</p>
<p>Management will review the capability requirements statement and decide if the 
</p>
<p>project is to go forward. If so, the project will move out of the requirements port-
</p>
<p>folio and go into the planning portfolio. The capability requirements statement is 
</p>
<p>the starting point for the creation of plans to fill the capability gap. In the case 
</p>
<p>of a major development, these plans are developed in two stages, referred to as 
</p>
<p>Prefeasibility Analysis and Feasibility Analysis. If the project proceeds success-
</p>
<p>fully through these stages, this leads on to the acquisition and implementation 
</p>
<p>of the capability. Figure 4.9 shows the steps at the prefeasibility and feasibility 
</p>
<p>analysis stages. In practice the level of formality in moving through the planning 
</p>
<p>process will depend on the complexity or otherwise of the project and the timing 
</p>
<p>requirements of the development. However, the basic logic of the process is valid, 
</p>
<p>even when some steps are accelerated.
</p>
<p>4.8   Prefeasibility Analysis
</p>
<p>Prefeasibility analysis starts from the requirements determined in the capability 
</p>
<p>requirements analysis stage. The analysis considers the scope of possible responses 
</p>
<p>to the requirements statement and examines options for delivering them. A pre-
</p>
<p>ferred option or small range of options is selected. It is important not to get emo-
</p>
<p>tionally committed to a particular option too early in the analysis. Prefeasibility 
</p>
<p>analysis may indicate that some aspects of the capability requirements statement 
</p>
<p>require review, resulting in reference back to the requirements planning stage.
</p>
<p>The result of the analysis is a prefeasibility plan and an initial business proposal 
</p>
<p>for the project. The proposal seeks approval to proceed to the feasibility analysis 
</p>
<p>stage where a fully detailed and costed plan will be developed. The selection of a 
</p>
<p>specific supplier will normally remain open at this point.

<p>74 4 From Concept to Project Approval
</p>
<p>4.9  Feasibility Analysis
</p>
<p>If the prefeasibility plan for a project is approved, the project enters the feasibil-
</p>
<p>ity planning stage. Here the plans for the preferred option from the prefeasibility 
</p>
<p>stage are subject to detailed analysis and costing. A feasibility planning project 
</p>
<p>team will develop the analysis and there will be a broader stakeholder review 
</p>
<p>which will provide feedback to the project team.
</p>
<p>The result of feasibility planning is a development plan and a final business 
</p>
<p>proposal. If this leads to a final decision to proceed, the project then enters the 
</p>
<p>approved business development plan and moves forward to the physical acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion or implementation phase.
</p>
<p>4.10  Development Plan
</p>
<p>The development plan will indicate what assets are planned to be acquired and 
</p>
<p>when. In Fig. 4.10 the heavy line at the top shows a series of planned acquisitions 
</p>
<p>which will be sufficient to keep capacity at a satisfactory level. A significant 
</p>
<p>amount of supporting analysis and detail will normally accompany the plan, and 
</p>
<p>we consider aspects of this in more detail in subsequent sections.

</p>
<p>Identify the stakeholders, that is, those people and functions that will be 
</p>
<p>affected by the proposed plan. Survey their opinions and take them into account 
</p>
<p>in developing, or even abandoning the plan. If necessary form a stakeholder 
</p>
<p>committee. It is important to the success of any project that the stakeholders buy 
</p>
<p>into the plan. Figure 4.11 shows some typical stakeholder groups.
</p>
<p>For asset developments, the stakeholders normally include the relevant busi-
</p>
<p>ness, operations, and maintenance managers and staff. Where customers and sup-
</p>
<p>pliers are affected they will potentially form part of the stakeholder group, subject 
</p>
<p>to business confidentiality. The plan is more likely to succeed if all the relevant 
</p>
<p>groups have contributed to its development. At the same time, some stakeholders 
</p>
<p>may resist the plan, particularly if they see it working against their interest, and 
</p>
<p>it will be necessary to use management judgement and authority to present the 
</p>
<p>3 ISO 55002 Clause 4.2 &ldquo;The organization shall determine the stakeholders&hellip;the expectations of 
these stakeholders&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>rationalization for the plan from the overall business viewpoint. But suffer fools 
</p>
<p>gladly&mdash;they may be right.
</p>
<p>4.12.2  Stakeholder Example
</p>
<p>A modification to a machine is proposed which involves fitting a protective device 
</p>
<p>designed to reduce rain and sun damage to exposed parts. This is estimated to pro-
</p>
<p>long the life of the machine. The device will be fitted by maintenance staff during 
</p>
<p>a servicing operation. Stakeholders involved are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Operations manager and operations superintendent&mdash;Production will prospec-
</p>
<p>tively benefit by extended machine life.
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance Superintendent&mdash;Reductions in scheduled maintenance and break-
</p>
<p>downs are intended.
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance Department&mdash;Required to install the modification.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reliability Superintendent&mdash;Improvements in reliability and reduction in down-
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>78 4 From Concept to Project Approval
</p>
<p>4.12.3  Existing Processes and the Status Quo
</p>
<p>In developing any plan it is important to be aware of the existing situation and 
</p>
<p>the existing processes. Be sure to check out the existing situation and consult with 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. Always consider the possibility of retaining the status quo, and use 
</p>
<p>this as a basis for comparison.
</p>
<p>4.12.4  Lead Time
</p>
<p>An important factor in creating development plans is an appreciation of the 
</p>
<p>amount of lead time required in order to introduce new equipment, and the range 
</p>
<p>of activities which are essential to success. An indication of typical lead time 
</p>
<p>activities is shown in Fig. 4.12.
</p>
<p>4.12.5  In-Service Date
</p>
<p>The Capability Requirements Statement will specify an &ldquo;In-Service Date&rdquo; as the 
</p>
<p>date when a capability is planned to be available for service. This may be a sin-
</p>
<p>gle date or a range of dates in the case of a phased introduction. For a phased 
</p>
<p>introduction we specify an Initial In-Service date and a Final In-Service date. An 
</p>
<p>implementation timetable may also be needed. At the early stages, these dates

</p>
<p>are preliminary estimates to be firmed up as the acquisition project proceeds. 
</p>
<p>Awareness of the lead time activities and project progress will enable the pro-
</p>
<p>ject team to keep the end-user informed of potential changes to in-service dates. 
</p>
<p>Adhering to the planned in-service date is a main target of the development team.
</p>
<p>4.12.6  Date of Decision
</p>
<p>To ensure an adequate focus on timing, it is desirable to specify a &ldquo;date of deci-
</p>
<p>sion&rdquo; for the final approval of a project whilst it is in the capability requirements 
</p>
<p>analysis and prefeasibility analysis stages. The many activities involved in an 
</p>
<p>acquisition or development can easily be underestimated and this may result in the 
</p>
<p>development not being completed in time to meet business needs.
</p>
<p>4.12.7  Operational Concept Document
</p>
<p>An operational concept document describes the characteristics of the proposed 
</p>
<p>development in end-user terms. The simplest cases are expansions of existing 
</p>
<p>functions. Other types of development may involve responses to new markets, new 
</p>
<p>services, new technologies, or developments to existing services or processes. The 
</p>
<p>development of this document will involve the operations group in working out 
</p>
<p>how the new capability will be used and how it will work in with existing capabil-
</p>
<p>ity. This can involve market appraisal, technology appraisal, procedural appraisal, 
</p>
<p>evaluation of competition, and financial appraisal.
</p>
<p>Project studies may be undertaken to evaluate feasibility and potential profit-
</p>
<p>ability of probable options. For example, the organization may require an exam-
</p>
<p>ination of capacity expansion options in terms of demand, revenue potential, 
</p>
<p>technical options, staffing levels, and considerations of cost and timing, and dis-
</p>
<p>posal and redeployment.
</p>
<p>The following factors are important in the development of the operational concept:
</p>
<p> a. Meet the market need in terms of key outputs, characteristics and features,
</p>
<p> b. Operationally practical,
</p>
<p> c. Technically feasible,
</p>
<p> d. Profitable,
</p>
<p> e. Affordable,
</p>
<p> f. Timing feasible,
</p>
<p> g. Technically supportable,
</p>
<p> h. No unsatisfactory risks,
</p>
<p> i. Reliability, availability, maintainability satisfactory,
</p>
<p> j. Meet design, environmental, health and safety standards,
</p>
<p> k. Life adequate,
</p>
<p> l. Retain some flexibility for revision as the acquisition develops.
</p>
<p>4.12 Considerations in Development Planning</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>80 4 From Concept to Project Approval
</p>
<p>4.12.8  Function and Performance Specifications
</p>
<p>From the operational concept we develop functional and performance 
</p>
<p>specifications for the key assets required. This about specifying how big, how 
</p>
<p>strong, how many seats, how heavy, what power, what flow rate, how many 
</p>
<p>bedrooms, how many bathrooms, how many garage spaces, what voltage, what 
</p>
<p>noise level, etc., we require in the intended assets. Some features may be essential 
</p>
<p>and some merely desirable. In developing specifications it is important not 
</p>
<p>to get carried away and set specifications which are unachievable or will imply 
</p>
<p>development work, unless development is a planned part of the project. Refer to 
</p>
<p>existing performance standards and keep to modest variations.
</p>
<p>4.12.8.1  Example
</p>
<p>A specification for a new design of rotating turret for a vehicle required a rota-
</p>
<p>tional speed which was set to a high level without reference to existing perfor-
</p>
<p>mance standards. At the prefeasibility stage it became apparent that to achieve this 
</p>
<p>performance would require a radical redesign of the drive system and quite infea-
</p>
<p>sible changes to the vehicle body. Reference back to the capability requirements 
</p>
<p>team showed that, once they related their specification to existing systems, they 
</p>
<p>were quite happy to accept a rotational speed comparable to existing best practice, 
</p>
<p>rather than the wildly optimistic number originally specified.
</p>
<p>4.12.9  Level of Service4
</p>
<p>Level of service relates to setting standards in such areas as performance, avail-
</p>
<p>ability, reliability, timeliness of response, and provision of information when prob-
</p>
<p>lems arise. Level of service relates to corresponding performance indicators. As an 
</p>
<p>example, in a railway system, a performance indicator is the proportion of services 
</p>
<p>that are not canceled due to train unavailability, and a corresponding level of ser-
</p>
<p>vice is a specification that this should be, say, 97 % or more.
</p>
<p>4.12.10  Scope of Work
</p>
<p>The scope of work details the work to be done and/or acquisitions to be made. 
</p>
<p>This will be refined as the project firms up and will ultimately form a basis for 
</p>
<p>procurement level costing and contracting.
</p>
<p>4 ISO 55000 Clause 3.3.6.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>81
</p>
<p>4.12.11  Financial Analysis
</p>
<p>Preliminary appraisals of revenue potential, costs, and profitability will be carried 
</p>
<p>out and will be refined as the proposal proceeds. The analysis will be supported by 
</p>
<p>data and estimates and a statement of assumptions, including the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Demand forecast
</p>
<p>&bull; Revenue forecast
</p>
<p>&bull; Personnel and operating cost
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment life cycle cost estimate
</p>
<p>&bull; Profit and Loss projection
</p>
<p>&bull; Cash Flow projection
</p>
<p>&bull; Balance Sheet projection
</p>
<p>&bull; Payback period, Internal rate of return
</p>
<p>&bull; Sensitivity analysis in regard to assumptions, particularly demand and costs
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of major risks, business, technical, and regulatory.
</p>
<p>4.12.12  Acquisition Strategy
</p>
<p>In considering acquisition and development options it is important to ensure that 
</p>
<p>they are feasible from a delivery point of view. A development team may be over-
</p>
<p>optimistic in assessing what the suppliers can supply and what the developers can 
</p>
<p>develop, within a given timescale and cost envelope.
</p>
<p>A danger lies in assuming that an acquisition is of an off-the-shelf nature when 
</p>
<p>in fact it requires adaptation to suit our needs. In this case it is advisable to under-
</p>
<p>take the adaptation as a separate project, and only to proceed to the main project 
</p>
<p>when we are sure that our needs can be met within desired business parameters.
</p>
<p>Another factor is the availability of resources to implement any acquisition or 
</p>
<p>development plan. This includes consideration of the availability of personnel for 
</p>
<p>design and development functions, for equipment specification and evaluation and 
</p>
<p>for cost analysis, legal and financial support and engineering support for acqui-
</p>
<p>sition and system implementation. Restrictions in these areas may be critical in 
</p>
<p>reducing the range of projects that can be undertaken.
</p>
<p>A summary of points relating to the acquisition strategy is as follows:
</p>
<p> a. What potential suppliers are available?
</p>
<p> b. How extensively should we canvas for potential suppliers?
</p>
<p> c. Do the potential suppliers have the necessary technical depth and logistic 
</p>
<p>support strength?
</p>
<p> d. Should we adopt a preferred supplier list? If not, is there a danger of excessive 
</p>
<p>logistic diversity or of attracting suppliers with insufficient technical backup?
</p>
<p> e. Should we go to open tender?
</p>
<p> f. Should we sole source?
</p>
<p>4.12 Considerations in Development Planning</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82 4 From Concept to Project Approval
</p>
<p> g. Is the item available &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo;?
</p>
<p> h. Is development work required?
</p>
<p> i. Should the acquisition/development be phased?
</p>
<p> j. If phased, will changes to the equipment over the phases be a problem?
</p>
<p> k. Should the acquisition be evolutionary, allowing for possible equipment 
</p>
<p>improvement over the acquisition process?
</p>
<p> l. Are there maintenance issues? Is a support contract available? Is outsourcing a 
</p>
<p>consideration?
</p>
<p> m. What major logistic issues are there?
</p>
<p>4.13  Project Maturity
</p>
<p>At any given point in time a number of projects will be in the feasibility Planning 
</p>
<p>Portfolio. Figure 4.13 shows a scoring system which enables management to track 
</p>
<p>the maturity status of these projects. As a project matures its total maturity score 
</p>
<p>will progress toward 25 and we can monitor progress and manage priorities by ref-
</p>
<p>erence to the maturity score at any point.
</p>
<p>4.14  Implementation Portfolio
</p>
<p>The result of feasibility planning is a development plan and a final business pro-
</p>
<p>posal. If this leads to a decision to proceed, the project then enters the approved 
</p>
<p>business development plan and moves forward to the implementation portfolio. 
</p>
<p>The Implementation Portfolio consists of the set of acquisition or development 
</p>
<p>projects which have been approved for development and are in progress, but not 
</p>
<p>yet handed over to operations. The steps in the journey from initial idea to asset 
</p>
<p>delivery and ultimate disposal are summarized in Fig. 4.14. The implementation 
</p>
<p>phase of a project is considered in a later chapter.

<p>4.15.3  Capacity Planning&mdash;Generators
</p>
<p>4.15.3.1  Gap Analysis
</p>
<p>An electricity generation company is considering developments for power gen-
</p>
<p>eration over the period from 5 to 8 years ahead. A forecast of demand including 
</p>
<p>reserve capacity indicates that demand will be for 5.2 Gigawatts (GW) in year 5, 
</p>
<p>increasing at 10 % per annum compound over the remainder of the planning period. 
</p>
<p>A projection of generating capacity available from existing sources is for 4.8 GW 
</p>
<p>to be available in years 5 and 6, decreasing by 0.6 GW per year in years 7 and 8.
</p>
<p>Calculate the following for each year of the planning period using a tabular 
</p>
<p>format.
</p>
<p>&bull; Year
</p>
<p>&bull; Needs
</p>
<p>&bull; Un-augmented capacity
</p>
<p>&bull; Capacity gap.
</p>
<p>4.15.3.2  Prefeasibility Planning and Options
</p>
<p>Two options for covering the generating capacity gap are to be considered. These are,
</p>
<p>a. adding generator capacity in 600 MW units at the minimal rate to cover the 
</p>
<p>forecast demand, at a cost of $1 billion per unit, with a lead time of 3 years.
</p>
<p>b. adding capacity by building 2 GW power stations at a cost of $2.7 billion each 
</p>
<p>with a lead time of 4 years.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>85
</p>
<p>Extend your tabular format to develop plans for the two options. Discuss the finan-
</p>
<p>cial and practical merits of two options and of other possible options. What major 
</p>
<p>elements of capability would be likely to be required besides the generators?
</p>
<p>4.15.4  Bottling Plant Exercise
</p>
<p>A bottling plant has four old bottling production lines which need 48 h a week of 
</p>
<p>scheduled operating time to meet demand. Unscheduled downtime has been eat-
</p>
<p>ing into planned production time recently. A business development review finds 
</p>
<p>that there is steady demand for the existing product, but that there is growing 
</p>
<p>demand for bottles with a screw-top closure. A range of new equipment at various 
</p>
<p>costs and levels of performance is available on the market. At present there are six 
</p>
<p>mechanics, but several are nearing retirement and mechanics with suitable skills 
</p>
<p>are not readily available. What should you do?

<p> Refer to Sect. 4.5.2. Factors are:
</p>
<p>&bull; asset knowledge
</p>
<p>&bull; existing level of demand
</p>
<p>&bull; technical trends
</p>
<p>&bull; current trends
</p>

<p>2. What is meant by the Date of Decision and how is it derived?
</p>
<p> Year of Decision&mdash;the year when a replacement decision needs to be made in 
</p>
<p>order to allow time for the acquisition lead time activities. It is derived by esti-
</p>
<p>mating the &ldquo;year of expiry,&rdquo; which is when an asset should be replaced, and 
</p>
<p>then subtracting the acquisition lead time. See Fig. 4.12.
</p>

</p>
<p> Refer to Sect. 4.12.10. The factors listed there are as follows:
</p>
<p> a. What potential suppliers are available?
</p>
<p> b. How extensively should we canvas for potential suppliers?
</p>
<p> c. Do the potential suppliers have the necessary technical depth and logistic 
</p>
<p>support strength?
</p>
<p> d. Should we adopt a preferred supplier list? If not, is there a danger of exces-
</p>
<p>sive logistic diversity or of attracting suppliers with insufficient technical 
</p>
<p>backup?
</p>
<p> e. Should we go to open tender?
</p>
<p> f. Should we sole source?
</p>
<p> g. Is the item available &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo;?
</p>
<p> h. Is development work required?
</p>
<p> i. Should the acquisition/development be phased?
</p>
<p> j. If phased, will changes to the equipment over the phases be a problem?
</p>
<p> k. Should the acquisition be evolutionary, allowing for possible equipment 
</p>
<p>improvement over the acquisition process?
</p>
<p> l. Are there maintenance issues? Is a support contract available? Is outsourc-

<p>ing a consideration?
</p>
<p> m. What major logistic issues are there?
</p>
<p>6. What is the difference between prefeasibility analysis and feasibility analysis?
</p>
<p> Prefeasibility analysis considers the scope of possible responses to a require-
</p>
<p>ments statement and examines options for delivering them. A preferred option 
</p>
<p>or small range of options is selected. Feasibility analysis is creating and costing 
</p>
<p>a plan for the preferred option, with a view to making a decision to proceed or 
</p>
<p>not.</p>

<p>4.19  A Business Imperative
</p>
<p>Jock and Sheila&rsquo;s trip to look at the blocks of land was not as successful as they 
</p>
<p>had hoped. The prices were much higher than they had anticipated and the best 
</p>
<p>blocks had already gone. They renewed the lease on their apartment and things </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>91
</p>
<p>drifted on for several months. Then one day Jock got in from work to find that 
</p>
<p>Sheila was already home and looking excited.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re home early,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; said Sheila.
</p>
<p>As he was already looking at her, this involved no special effort on Jock&rsquo;s part.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened!&rdquo; said Sheila.
</p>
<p>With no further response from Jock she gave him a &ldquo;men are so dumb&rdquo; look 
</p>
<p>and said,
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pregnant!
</p>
<p>Jock picked her up and whirled her around.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>He put her down gently.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he said.
</p>
<p>A little while later, Sheila said,
</p>
<p>We are going to have to get on with buying a house. We will need three bed-
</p>
<p>rooms, or maybe four&mdash;and a new car.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t need so many bedrooms at the start,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;and why do we 
</p>
<p>need a new car.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Well we can hardly put a baby seat in that ridiculous two-seater, and we will 
</p>
<p>need room for a pram and baby things. I think we&rsquo;ll have to get a hatch-back.
</p>
<p>Jock gave a slight groan.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you pleased?&rdquo; said Sheila looking hurt.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jock, and he thought about the Capability Development Team 
</p>
<p>that he was involved in for the process plant expansion at work.
</p>
<p>His mind turned back to the impending baby. It wasn&rsquo;t the technicalities that 
</p>
<p>worried him. It was the money.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can get the job of Project Leader for the next Feasibility study&rdquo; he 
</p>
<p>said, half out loud.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t one of those work projects that you spend all your time thinking 
</p>
<p>about,&rdquo; said Sheila. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a baby and it&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>He gave her another hug.

<p>Asset management decisions involve the application of a combination of technical and 
</p>
<p>financial knowledge. Asset managers play a key role in ensuring that the physical facts

<p>and the financial and cost data which are used in making asset management decisions 
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55002 Clause 6.2 &lsquo;Asset management objectives and planning to achieve them,&rsquo; and sub-
clause 6.2.1.3, indicate a requirement for consideration of financial analysis methods including

</p>
<p>are sufficiently accurate and sufficiently well aligned so that sound decisions can be 
</p>
<p>made. To carry out these functions successfully, asset managers need to be familiar 
</p>
<p>with the language and methods of accounting and financial analysis.2
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we shall introduce a range of methods of financial analysis and 
</p>
<p>shall illustrate them by asset-related examples. In practice, these methods are used to 
</p>
<p>assess whether particular projects are financially worthwhile, and if so, to support the 
</p>
<p>business case for the projects. By adopting standard methods of financial analysis, we 
</p>
<p>can evaluate and compare projects in a consistent manner. These standard financial 
</p>
<p>analysis methods also provide the basis for good communication between asset man-
</p>
<p>agers and financial analysts. Financial methods are developed further in later chapters.
</p>
<p>5.2  Discounted Cash Flow
</p>
<p>Fixed assets such as buildings, infrastructure, and plant have lives extending over many 
</p>
<p>years. Discounted cash flow analysis is a method of analyzing cash flows over a period 
</p>
<p>of years, which takes account of the time value of money. The topic involves the con-
</p>
<p>cepts of interest rate, discount factor, present value (PV), cash flow diagrams, and equiv-
</p>
<p>alent annual cost (EAC). We shall study these concepts in an asset management context 
</p>
<p>and also use Excel spreadsheet functions to calculate discounted cash flow quantities.
</p>
<p>An example of the application of discounted cash flow that we encounter in eve-
</p>
<p>ryday life is the repayment of a loan for a motor vehicle purchase. This involves 
</p>
<p>borrowing money and then repaying the initial capital and also the interest on the 
</p>
<p>outstanding loan, so that ultimately both capital and interest costs are covered. 
</p>
<p>Another similar example is the repayment of a mortgage.
</p>
<p>5.2.1  Interest Rate
</p>
<p>The interest rate is the cost or return per year of either borrowing or lending 
</p>
<p>money, expressed as either a decimal fraction or a percentage of the amount bor-
</p>
<p>rowed or lent. The interest rate on borrowing is higher than on lending, the differ-
</p>
<p>ence being the bank&rsquo;s margin or source of income.
</p>
<p>An industrial project will only be worthwhile if the return on it exceeds the 
</p>
<p>return which we could get on a safe investment such as a bank deposit or govern-
</p>
<p>ment bonds. The return must also be high enough to cover the cost involved in 
</p>
<p>carrying out the project, the risk that all may not go according to plan and to pro-
</p>
<p>vide a profit in return for the effort involved. For information on the interest rate 
</p>
<p>applicable to particular asset-related calculations, it is advisable to consult your 
</p>
<p>finance personnel. For calculation purposes it is easy to change an interest rate in a 
</p>
<p>spreadsheet and to assess the sensitivity of a calculation to different interest rates.
</p>
<p>2 ISO 55001 Clause 7.5 Information Requirements: &ldquo;The organization shall determine the 
requirements for alignment with financial&hellip; terminology&hellip;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;The organization shall ensure there is consistency&hellip;between financial and technical data&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>

</p>
<p>5.2.2  Present Value (PV)
</p>
<p>The PV of an amount of money Vn received in n years time is the amount of money 
</p>
<p>available now which will attain the value Vn if invested at interest over the inter-
</p>
<p>vening years. For an interest rate r, the present value, PV, of an amount V1 received 
</p>
<p>in 1 year&rsquo;s time is given by the equation:
</p>
<p>Thus, with an interest rate of 10 %, the PV of $100 received in 1 year&rsquo;s time is:
</p>
<p>For an amount Vn received in n years time, the PV is given by:
</p>
<p>5.2.2.1  Why Consider Present Value?
</p>
<p>The reason why we need to consider PV is that asset investments often only pay 
</p>
<p>off over a period of years. We need to take account of this delay factor in making 
</p>
<p>asset management decisions.
</p>
<p>5.2.3  Discount Factor
</p>
<p>The multiplier 1/(1 + r) which occurs in Eqs. 5.1&ndash;5.3, arises frequently in discounted 
</p>
<p>cash flow analysis and is known as the discount factor. The discount factor is the pro-
</p>
<p>portion by which an amount is reduced to give its equivalent value 1 year earlier. We 
</p>
<p>shall denote the discount factor by the symbol p. Then:
</p>
<p>Using the discount factor, p, the PV of an amount Vn received in n years time is 
</p>
<p>given by:
</p>
<p>Example: Calculate the PV of $100 received in 2 years time, with an interest rate 
</p>
<p>of 10 %.
</p>
<p>Solution: For an interest rate of 10 %,
</p>
<p>We see that $100 received in 2 years time only has the same value as $82.64 
</p>
<p>received now, assuming a 10 % interest rate.
</p>
<p>(5.1)PV = V1
/
</p>

</p>
<p>5.2.4  Net Present Value (NPV)
</p>
<p>The NPV of a series amounts received or expended over a number of years is the 
</p>
<p>sum of the PV of the amounts. For a series of amounts $Vi received in i years time, 
</p>
<p>the Net Present Value, NPV, is the amount of money available now which is equal 
</p>
<p>to the value of the series, allowing for the interest rate.
</p>
<p>5.2.4.1  Example
</p>
<p>As an example, consider receiving $100 in 1 year&rsquo;s time and then another $100 
</p>
<p>in 2 years time. If the interest rate is 10 %, the discount factor will be as given by 
</p>
<p>Eq. 5.6, that is p = 0.9091. Using the symbols of Eq. 5.8 we have:
</p>
<p>Thus the NPV of the amounts received is $173.55. In other words, $100 received 
</p>
<p>in 1 year&rsquo;s time plus $100 received in 2 years time has the same value as $173.55 
</p>
<p>received right now, if the interest rate is 10 %.
</p>
<p>5.2.4.2  Cash Flow
</p>
<p>A cash flow is an amount of money that we receive or expend. Money received is 
</p>
<p>a positive cash flow and expenditures are negative cash flows. In the example just 
</p>
<p>given, both cash flows were positive. More generally, in NPV calculations some of 
</p>
<p>the cash flows may be positive and some negative.
</p>
<p>5.2.4.3  Why Consider NPV?
</p>
<p>The reason why we need to consider NPV is that asset investments often involve a 
</p>
<p>series of expenditures and revenues over a period of years. We need to take account 
</p>
<p>of amounts and timings of these cash flows in making asset management decisions. 
</p>
<p>Use of the NPV allows us to put any series of cash flows onto a common basis.
</p>
<p>5.2.5  Cash Flow Diagram
</p>
<p>A cash flow diagram is a schematic representation of cash received and expended 
</p>
<p>year by year in the course of an activity. A cash flow diagram is a convenient way 
</p>
<p>of visualizing the income and expenditure in a project. As an example, consider the 
</p>
<p>(5.8)NPV = V0 + pV1 + p
2V2 + &middot; &middot; &middot; + p
</p>
<p>nVn
</p>
<p>V0 = 0, V1 = 100, V2 = 100, p = 0.9091.
</p>
<p>(5.9)NPV = 0 + 0.9091 &times; 100 + 0.90912 &times; 100 = $173.55.</p>

<p>in this type of calculation. The cash flows can be represented as shown in Fig. 5.1.
</p>
<p>The NPV of the cash flows in Fig. 5.1 can be calculated using Eq. 5.8. Prior to 
</p>
<p>the widespread availability of spreadsheets, PV calculations were facilitated by the 
</p>
<p>use of tables which give values of the n year discount factor, pn, for various values 
</p>
<p>of interest rate and numbers of years. Appendix shows an example of such a table. 
</p>
<p>However, in current practice we are likely to use a spreadsheet such as Excel for 
</p>
<p>this type of calculation so we shall illustrate the use of the Excel NPV function.
</p>
<p>5.2.6  Excel Function NPV
</p>
<p>In Fig. 5.2 the Excel function NPV is used to calculate the NPV of the life cycle 
</p>
<p>costs for the loader. The costs are as shown in Fig. 5.1. In the spreadsheet, Fig. 5.2, 
</p>
<p>cells B3&minus;F3 show the acquisition and maintenance costs of the loader. Note that 
</p>
<p>the net cost in year 4 was entered, that is the maintenance cost minus the trade-in 
</p>
<p>value. The interest rate in this case was 9 % and this value is shown at cell B1.

</p>
<p>The format of the NPV function is illustrated in the function field in Fig. 5.2. 
</p>
<p>The Excel NPV function calculates the NPV of a series of values at a given inter-
</p>
<p>est rate, for annual payments starting in 1 year&rsquo;s time. An initial cost, which is 
</p>
<p>undiscounted, in this case the acquisition cost from cell B3, must be shown sepa-
</p>
<p>rately from the range of values supplied to the NPV function.
</p>
<p>From the spreadsheet, we see that the NPV of the life cycle cost is $886,295, 
</p>
<p>shown at cell B4.
</p>
<p>5.2.6.1  Applications of the NPV
</p>
<p>The NPV is useful in understanding the total cost involved over the life cycle of 
</p>
<p>the machine and in relating it to revenue factors, such as the value of the work 
</p>
<p>done by the machine in its life time. The NPV of the life cycle cost can be used to 
</p>
<p>compare rival types of machine, with the machine with the lowest NPV being the 
</p>
<p>one to be preferred, provided that the performance is similar. In making compari-
</p>
<p>sons, we must be careful to ensure that the comparison is fair in terms of factors 
</p>
<p>such as the productive capacity of rival machines.
</p>
<p>5.2.7  Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC)
</p>
<p>EAC is the amount of a regular annual cost which, over a given period of years, 
</p>
<p>has the same NPV as any given series of costs. The EAC converts the NPV into 
</p>
<p>an equivalent annual amount. The term Equivalent Annual Value (EAV) is also be 
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.2  NPV of life cycle cost of a new loader</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>99
</p>
<p>used when income as well as cost is considered. An example of an EAC is a mort-
</p>
<p>gage repayment made at a regular amount per year. The NPV of the payments over 
</p>
<p>the whole period adds up to the amount of the original loan plus the interest pay-
</p>
<p>ments on the loan.
</p>
<p>5.2.7.1  Why Do We Calculate the EAC?
</p>
<p>EAC is a useful concept in asset management. It helps in the comparison of 
</p>
<p>options, particularly where the options are dissimilar in type or duration. The dif-
</p>
<p>ference between two options can often be more easily appreciated, particularly in 
</p>
<p>relation to external or risk factors, when converted into an annual cost. Examples 
</p>
<p>are in comparing life cycle costs of different items, or of similar items over dif-
</p>
<p>ferent lives, and comparing the value or cost of competing projects with different 
</p>
<p>durations. For example, in deciding on a house purchase we look at the capital 
</p>
<p>cost, but also we focus on the monthly mortgage repayments and whether we can 
</p>
<p>afford them from our income. This is essentially an &ldquo;EAC&rdquo; assessment.
</p>
<p>5.2.7.2  Excel Function PMT
</p>
<p>We can use the Excel function PMT to calculate an EAC. The name PMT derives 
</p>
<p>from the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo;. In Fig. 5.3 the Excel function PMT is used to calculate the 
</p>
<p>EAC of the loader, using the data in Fig. 5.2. The function field shows the format of 
</p>
<p>the Excel function PMT. The PMT function value takes the opposite sign to the NPV, 
</p>
<p>and the minus sign in front of the function gives the EAC the same sign as the NPV.

</p>
<p>In Fig. 5.3, cell B1 shows the interest rate at 9 % and cells B3&minus;F3 show the 
</p>
<p>acquisition and maintenance costs of the loader as before. Cell B5 shows the EAC 
</p>
<p>for the loader, which is $273,571 per year. The EAC provides information to sup-
</p>
<p>plement that provided by the NPV, and is useful in asset management decisions 
</p>
<p>such as comparing with possible leasing costs and in replacement decisions.
</p>
<p>5.2.8  Relationship Between EAC and NPV
</p>
<p>In Fig. 5.3, cells B4 and B5 show the NPV ($886,295) and the EAC ($273,571 per 
</p>
<p>year) for the loader, respectively. Figure 5.4 illustrates the relationship between the 
</p>
<p>NPV and the EAC, with the NPV being the NPV of the series of costs represented 
</p>
<p>by the EAC over the specified life cycle.
</p>
<p>5.3  Other Financial Terms
</p>
<p>Here are some other financial terms which may be encountered in an asset man-
</p>
<p>agement context.
</p>
<p>5.3.1  Annuity Factor
</p>
<p>The annuity factor is the NPV of an amount of $1 per year, received for n years, 
</p>
<p>with the first dollar being received in 1 year&rsquo;s time, at a specified interest rate. The 
</p>
<p>relationship between the NPV and the EAC is:

<p>NPV = $886,295</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>101
</p>
<p>Prior to the widespread availability of spreadsheets, tables of the annuity factor 
</p>
<p>were used to calculate the EAC from the NPV. An example of such a table is given 
</p>
<p>in Appendix.
</p>
<p>5.3.2  Capital Recovery Factor
</p>
<p>The Capital Recovery Factor, C, is the reciprocal of the Annuity Factor. It is the 
</p>
<p>amount we need to receive per year for n years to have an NPV of $1 at the spec-
</p>
<p>ified interest rate. The Capital Recovery Factor is the amount that must be paid 
</p>
<p>each year over the given repayment period, per dollar of initial capital, in order to 
</p>
<p>repay that capital and the interest on the outstanding capital at each stage. These 
</p>
<p>concepts are related by the following equations:
</p>
<p>5.3.3  Equivalent Unit Cost (EUC)
</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to make comparisons between items which serve similar pur-
</p>
<p>poses but have different capacities. For example, we may be deciding whether 
</p>
<p>to purchase haulage trucks of 50 or 200 tonne capacity. The concept of EUC is 
</p>
<p>useful here. The EUC is the EAC divided by the number of units of production 
</p>
<p>which the item has capacity to generate, per year. For comparison purposes, we 
</p>
<p>will need to make standardizing assumptions for each of the relevant items, such 
</p>
<p>as how many shifts are worked by each type of equipment. We refer to the pro-
</p>
<p>ductive capacity per year as the Annual Production Capacity (APC). The EUC is 
</p>
<p>then given by:
</p>
<p>5.4  Asset Investment Criteria
</p>
<p>In this section, we describe the methods used in evaluating the financial merits 
</p>
<p>of investments in physical assets and illustrate these by examples. The examples 
</p>
<p>used are intended to illustrate the principles involved and it will be understood 
</p>
<p>that practical situations typically involve more detail and a wider range of rele-
</p>
<p>vant factors, including possibly less readily costable benefits. The investments 
</p>
<p>that we are considering may be of a variety of types, including asset acquisitions, 
</p>
<p>(5.10)EAC = NPV/Annuity Factor
</p>
<p>(5.11)Capital Recovery Factor = 1/Annuity Factor
</p>

</p>
<p>5.4.1  Net Present Value
</p>
<p>If we are to invest in an acquisition or development, key financial questions are;
</p>
<p>&bull; what returns can we expect?
</p>
<p>&bull; when can we expect to get them?
</p>
<p>&bull; will the investment be worthwhile?
</p>
<p>The NPV tells us what an investment is worth. For an investment to be worth-
</p>
<p>while, the NPV must be positive and it must also be sufficiently large to satisfy 
</p>
<p>other criteria that we shall consider in this section.
</p>
<p>A first step in any investment decision is usually to estimate the NPV of the 
</p>
<p>investment, using the methods already detailed in Sect. 5.2, and in particular 
</p>
<p>Eq. 5.8. An example is given as Exercise 5.5.1, NPV of Material Handling System, 
</p>
<p>at the end of this chapter.
</p>
<p>5.4.2  Payback Period
</p>
<p>The payback period is the time required to recoup an investment. Suppose that we 
</p>
<p>initially invest an amount V0 in a given capability and that it generates returns V1, 
</p>
<p>V2, V3,&hellip; in years 1, 2, 3,&hellip; The payback period is reached when the NPV of the 
</p>
<p>sum of V1, V2, V3,&hellip; first exceeds V0. An investment which has a short payback 
</p>
<p>period is attractive because there is less risk that things will go wrong over a short 
</p>
<p>time frame.
</p>
<p>Use of the payback period avoids the difficulty of evaluating a long series of 
</p>
<p>returns, since all we focus on is how quickly the series becomes positive.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.5 illustrates the concept of the payback period.
</p>
<p>An example is given as Exercise 5.5.2, Pay Back Period of Material Handling 
</p>
<p>System, at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>103
</p>
<p>5.4.3  Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
</p>
<p>Suppose that we invest an amount V0 and that it generates returns V1, V2, V3,&hellip;Vn 
</p>
<p>in years 1, 2, 3,&hellip;, n. The internal rate of return is the value of the interest rate 
</p>
<p>which makes the present value of the sum of the returns exactly equal to the value 
</p>
<p>of the initial investment.
</p>
<p>Thus if,
</p>
<p>Then p is the discount factor for which the corresponding interest rate is the inter-
</p>
<p>nal rate of return (IRR).
</p>
<p>This is illustrated in Fig. 5.6 which shows the initial investment and the cumu-
</p>
<p>lative discounted cash flow for its subsequent returns. The internal rate of return is 
</p>
<p>the rate at which a project generates returns from the money invested in it. It is the 
</p>
<p>return on the unrecovered balances, not the rate of return on the initial investment 
</p>
<p>over the whole period of the project.
</p>
<p>The internal rate of return (IRR) of a project provides a measure of profitability 
</p>
<p>which can be compared with returns on other investments. The IRR calculation is also 
</p>
<p>a form of risk analysis. The higher the IRR, the less susceptible the project is to risk.
</p>
<p>5.4.3.1  Excel Function IRR
</p>
<p>Calculation of the IRR is complex, as it involves solving Eq. 5.14 for the dis-
</p>
<p>count factor, p, and hence getting the value of the internal rate of return, r. Excel 
</p>
<p>includes an IRR function which will carry out the necessary calculations. An 
</p>
<p>illustration of the use of the Excel IRR function is given in the solution to the 
</p>
<p>Communications System Exercise at the end of this chapter, Fig. 5.10.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>104 5 Financial Methods
</p>
<p>5.4.4  Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR)
</p>
<p>It is common business practice to expect an investment to achieve at least a cer-
</p>
<p>tain internal rate of return, if it is going to receive financial approval. This return 
</p>
<p>is known as the Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR) or as the Hurdle 
</p>
<p>Rate. The minimum acceptable rate of return is a return which will cover:
</p>
<p>&bull; the costs incurred in carrying out the project,
</p>
<p>&bull; the cost of capital, including both the interest charged and the repayment of the 
</p>
<p>capital over the period of the investment,
</p>
<p>&bull; an element of profit on the project,
</p>
<p>&bull; an allowance for risk.
</p>
<p>Typically, this leads to a MARR of not less than 15 %.
</p>
<p>An example of a MARR calculation is given in the solution to the Communications 
</p>
<p>System Exercise, Fig. 5.10.
</p>
<p>5.4.5  Profitability Index
</p>
<p>Another investment measure is the Profitability Index. This is defined as:
</p>
<p>The calculations are based on discounting at the MARR. For a project to be 
</p>
<p>acceptable, its Profitability Index must be greater than 1. Competing projects can 
</p>
<p>be ranked by their profitability index.
</p>
<p>An example of a profitability index calculation is given in the solution to the 
</p>
<p>Communications System Case Study Exercise, Fig. 5.11.
</p>
<p>5.4.6  Return on Investment (ROI)
</p>
<p>In the case of a specific project, the Return on Investment is the same as the 
</p>
<p>Internal Rate of Return which we have already considered. When considering the 
</p>
<p>activities of the organization as a whole&mdash;as opposed to individual projects&mdash;we 
</p>
<p>define the return on investment as follows:
</p>
<p>Thus, for example, an organization with $1 billion in operating assets and $100 
</p>
<p>million in operating profit would have a ROI of 10 %.
</p>
<p>(5.15)Profitability Index = NPV of Earnings Net Investment/Investment
</p>
<p>(5.16)ROI = Annual Operating Profit $/Value of Operating Assets $.</p>

</p>
<p>5.4.7  Project Financial Measures&mdash;Summary
</p>
<p>The following project financial measures have been outlined. Here we summarize 
</p>
<p>some of their features. In practice, we may evaluate several of the measures to 
</p>
<p>help us in our investment decisions.
</p>
<p>a. Net Present Value NPV: This is the only measure that indicates the size of a 
</p>
<p>project. It does not give an indication of risk, but analyses can be carried out 
</p>
<p>under different scenarios and at different interest rates as an aid to evaluating 
</p>
<p>risk.
</p>
<p>b. Payback Period: Gives an indication of how soon we expect a project to be &ldquo;in 
</p>
<p>the black.&rdquo; A short payback period is a highly desirable feature in an invest-
</p>
<p>ment, as it is then less sensitive to risk and to revenue or costs estimates which 
</p>
<p>can become inaccurate over time.
</p>
<p>c. Internal Rate of Return IRR: This is probably the most widely used measure. 
</p>
<p>When compared with the Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR), it 
</p>
<p>indicates whether a project is financially worthwhile and gives an indication of 
</p>
<p>risk. A project with a high IRR is less vulnerable to risk.
</p>
<p>d. Profitability Index: Simpler in concept than the IRR, but plays the same role in 
</p>
<p>estimating the financial viability of a project.

<p>5.6.2  Materials Handling System Payback Period&mdash;Solution
</p>
<p>To determine the payback period, we calculate the cumulative NPV of the invest-
</p>
<p>ment plus its related returns, working forward year by year until a positive value 
</p>
<p>is obtained. Figure 5.9 shows the calculation of the NPV of the investment plus 
</p>
<p>returns working forward year by year. The financial data are in row 3, and row 4 
</p>
<p>shows the NPV of the cumulative returns up to years 1, 2, 3, and 4.
</p>
<p>As an example of the calculation, the formula field shows the formula used to 
</p>
<p>calculate the returns up to end of year 3. This is given by the initial investment, 
</p>
<p>from cell B3, plus the NPV of the returns from end of year 1 to end of year 3, 
</p>
<p>from cells C3:E3. The result for year 3 is &minus;$89,083, showing that we have not 
</p>
<p>fully recouped the investment by the end of year 3. However, for year 4 we get 
</p>
<p>a positive value of $527,944, shown in cell F4. Hence we see that the payback 
</p>
<p>period for this investment is a little over 3 years.
</p>
<p>The project appears worthwhile as the payback period is reasonably short and 
</p>
<p>the benefits may continue for some time ahead. However, there is always the pos-
</p>
<p>sibility of further technical developments in a time frame of 5 years plus.

<p>Figure 5.10 shows the calculation of the IRR using Excel. The investment amount 
</p>
<p>of $2,500,000 is in cell B3 and the expected savings are in cells C3&minus;G3. Cell B4 
</p>
<p>shows the IRR which is 15.85 %. The IRR function is shown in the function field.
</p>
<p>In this example the IRR is 15.85 %, so that, at a MARR of 15 %, the project is 
</p>
<p>just acceptable.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to outline the principle steps involved in 
</p>
<p>developing a business case. Asset managers are frequently involved in developing 
</p>
<p>business cases which may range from the level of major capital projects to process 
</p>
<p>improvements or system changes. Business cases are also required for activities 
</p>
<p>such as outsourcing. This chapter is concerned with the overall structure outline 
</p>
<p>content of business cases. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will know what 
</p>
<p>steps to take in order to develop a business case. You will have available a list of 
</p>
<p>headings under which a business case can be developed, for both large and small 
</p>
<p>projects. You will have enjoyed reading about the use of business case methods to 
</p>
<p>choose a bottle of wine in a restaurant.
</p>
<p>6.1  Business Case Introduction1
</p>
<p>A business case is an argument for taking a particular acquisition or development 
</p>
<p>path. It involves defining the proposed path and stating the reasons for and against 
</p>
<p>pursuing that path, in terms of revenue, costs, discounted cash flow criteria, bene-
</p>
<p>fits, and risks. Development of a business case is an essential activity which arises 
</p>
<p>at several stages in the asset development process. Asset management personnel 
</p>
<p>need to be familiar with the steps involved in developing a business case, and to 
</p>
<p>be skilled in developing and presenting cases. It is also important to undertake 
</p>
<p>this task objectively, so that the business advantages and disadvantages of any 
</p>
<p>particular case are presented in a balanced way, without undue bias or emotional 
</p>
<p>commitment.
</p>
<p>The ability to develop and present a well-argued business case is a key attribute 
</p>
<p>of a good asset manager. Lack of ability to develop and present a business case 
</p>
<p>indicates a lack of maturity in the asset management role.
</p>
<p>1 Relevant areas of the standards are ISO 55001 Clause 6.2.2 and ISO 55002 Clauses 6.2.1.3 and 
6.2.2.1.

<p>114 6 Developing a Business Case
</p>
<p>Good management will take many factors into account when assessing a 
</p>
<p> proposal, but it is important to recognize that the focus of senior management will 
</p>
<p>certainly include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Profit,
</p>
<p>&bull; Accountability, and
</p>
<p>&bull; Business strategy.
</p>
<p>Practitioners are often more focused on:
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment availability,
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance,
</p>
<p>&bull; Logistics,
</p>
<p>&bull; Risks,
</p>
<p>&bull; Continuity, and
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology.
</p>
<p>The asset management role involves bridging the gap, giving the best outcome 
</p>
<p>for the organization as a whole. In particular it should be recognized that any par-
</p>
<p>ticular project may have merits, but is likely to be in financial competition with 
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>It is therefore essential to bring financial considerations to bear and to express 
</p>
<p>these in standard terms such as Return on Investment and Net Present Value in 
</p>
<p>order to establish the case in the minds of senior management.
</p>
<p>6.2  Development Plan
</p>
<p>Before a business case can be developed it is essential to create the plan on which 
</p>
<p>it is to be based. In the case of a major project development, based on the proce-
</p>
<p>dure outlined in the previous chapter, project planning and business case develop-
</p>
<p>ment proceed hand-in-hand. Thus, the prefeasibility analysis phase will lead to the 
</p>
<p>development of an initial business case. If this is approved the project will enter 
</p>
<p>the feasibility analysis phase which will lead to the development of the final busi-
</p>
<p>ness case, and if this is approved the project will proceed to the acquisition/devel-
</p>
<p>opment stage.
</p>
<p>Besides the formal development of business cases for major projects, we will 
</p>
<p>often want to develop business cases in a wide range of situations. The evaluation 
</p>
<p>of options for practically any development can be assisted by the development of 
</p>
<p>an initial business case. For minor projects the two stage process used in major 
</p>
<p>developments may still be followed in principle, but only one actual business case 
</p>
<p>will normally be created, and less detail will be required.</p>

</p>
<p>6.5  Impact of Downtime
</p>
<p>When a machine breaks down, there is usually a loss of production or service, as 
</p>
<p>well as repair costs, and little or no saving on other costs of doing business. Many 
</p>
<p>projects involve a justification based on reductions in actual or potential downtime.
</p>
<p>The impact of downtime can vary widely depending on circumstances. In mak-
</p>
<p>ing out a business case for an asset-based acquisition or improvement, it is desir-
</p>
<p>able to address the issues associated with the impact of downtime or other service 
</p>
<p>losses which may occur if the project is not pursued. The following are some types 
</p>
<p>of cost arising from downtime:
</p>
<p>Loss of production which cannot be made up In this case, sales of the product 
</p>
<p>are lost and the corresponding revenue is lost. The cost of downtime is the cost of 
</p>
<p>6.3 Business Case Outline</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>118 6 Developing a Business Case
</p>
<p>the lost sales minus unused consumables. This applies to every machine for which 
</p>
<p>downtime results in irrecoverable loss of production. Machines which impact fully 
</p>
<p>on lost revenue are referred to as bottleneck machines. Asset improvement efforts 
</p>
<p>are often directed at relieving bottlenecks, with the idea of improving throughput 
</p>
<p>and reducing vulnerability of revenue to failures at the bottleneck.
</p>
<p>Recoverable production loss Machine downtime may cause a production loss 
</p>
<p>which can be made up by overtime working, subcontracting, outside purchas-
</p>
<p>ing, etc. When the machine is down, some costs may be saved, e.g., power and 
</p>
<p>other consumables. But the cost of idle labor is often not recoverable. In this 
</p>
<p>case the cost of downtime is the extra cost of running the machine in overtime. 
</p>
<p>For subcontracting it is the cost of the subcontract minus the saving of unused 
</p>
<p>consumables. For outside purchase it is the outside purchase cost minus unused 
</p>
<p>consumables.
</p>
<p>Contractual financial loss Failure to deliver the product on time may result in 
</p>
<p>financial loss as part of a contract undertaking. Alternative product may need to be 
</p>
<p>bought in from more expensive sources.
</p>
<p>Loss of goodwill This may result in lost sales in the future and may have nega-
</p>
<p>tive political impacts.
</p>
<p>Spare capacity To reduce the impact of machine downtime we may introduce 
</p>
<p>spare capacity. For example, a company operates a fleet of four-wheel-drive vehi-
</p>
<p>cles to support its operations. In normal operation, 80 vehicles are required to be 
</p>
<p>available. The company has a fleet of 90 vehicles, providing a repair pool to cover 
</p>
<p>breakdowns and routine maintenance. The provision of this spare capacity is a 
</p>
<p>cost. If breakdowns occur to the extent that there are production losses, this is an 
</p>
<p>additional to the cost of providing spare capacity.
</p>
<p>Continuing with the vehicle fleet example, if the condition of the fleet deterio-
</p>
<p>rates to an extent that less than 80 vehicles are available, and this impacts on pro-
</p>
<p>duction, then we need to address this by changes such as replacing older vehicles, 
</p>
<p>increasing the size of the repair pool, or improving operating or maintenance prac-
</p>
<p>tices. The justification for a project to make these changes would involve identify-
</p>
<p>ing the impact on the business of the loss of availability of the vehicles.
</p>
<p>6.5.1  Physical or Service Losses
</p>
<p>It is often easier to identify physical or service losses than it is to put an accurate 
</p>
<p>cost on them. The reduction of losses may well be worthwhile even though we 
</p>
<p>cannot cost them accurately. In making out a business case we should estimate the 
</p>
<p>savings in physical or service terms, even if the precise financial effect is hard to 
</p>
<p>quantify. Financial and operations&rsquo; managers can make their own assessments of 
</p>
<p>the impact of physical losses, and this may vary with the state of the market, levels 
</p>
<p>of stockpiles, and so on.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>119
</p>
<p>For example, an ore loader moves approximately 5,000 tonnes of ore per day. 
</p>
<p>If the loader is down for a day, 5,000 tonnes of production will be lost. This 
</p>
<p>is the physical loss rate from loader downtime. If the typical sales price of the 
</p>
<p>minerals yielded by a tonne of ore is $100 then the loss of 5,000 tonnes amounts 
</p>
<p>to $500,000 in lost revenue. This is a figure which can be given in the business 
</p>
<p>case, but the basis for calculation should always be given. Including the physical 
</p>
<p>loss rate in a business case will provide information on which management can 
</p>
<p>make its own financial judgement based on the perceived value of this produc-
</p>
<p>tion loss.
</p>
<p>In a general business setting, the term Price of Non-Conformance (PONC) is 
</p>
<p>used to describe the costs involved in any deviation from correct processes.
</p>
<p>6.5.2  Cost of Failure
</p>
<p>Figure 6.1 lists some of the cost factors which can arise when a failure occurs.
</p>
<p>6.5.3  Indicate Savings and Returns on Investment
</p>
<p>Always give a financial estimate of the value of your proposal and the basis on 
</p>
<p>which it is calculated. For a proposal which will improve reliability, provide fore-
</p>
<p>casts of the reduction in the numbers of failures and hence in the costs of down-
</p>
<p>time, repairs, spares, and lost production. Provide historical or comparative data 
</p>
<p>where possible.

<p>120 6 Developing a Business Case
</p>
<p>For a proposal which will reduce downtime, estimate the reduction in production 
</p>
<p>or service losses and estimate the value to the organization. This will offset any addi-
</p>
<p>tional expenditure on maintenance personnel or equipment.
</p>
<p>Liaise with accounting personnel on getting the financial implications correct 
</p>
<p>and in regard to the timing of submissions.
</p>
<p>Indicate trends, e.g., increasing demand, aging equipment, replacement require-
</p>
<p>ments, changes in costs, and the financial implications of these factors.
</p>
<p>6.6  The Final Decision to Proceed
</p>
<p>The final decision to proceed lies with senior management. It will be based on 
</p>
<p>financial considerations, combined with judgement in relation to forecasts of 
</p>
<p>future developments, consideration of future flexibility and of risks to both the 
</p>
<p>project itself and to the assumptions underlying the business case. Health, safety, 
</p>
<p>and regulatory factors will be considered.
</p>
<p>6.7  Approved Development Plan
</p>
<p>Once approved, a project becomes part of the organization&rsquo;s approved Business 
</p>
<p>Development Plan. This is a portfolio maintained by the organization, which con-
</p>
<p>tains all project plans which have received final approval but are not yet introduced 
</p>
<p>into service.
</p>
<p>Projects in the approved Business Development Plan must be taken into 
</p>
<p>account in subsequent planning, and will be regarded as fixed, unless changes are 
</p>
<p>approved at senior level. Such changes should only be made in response to signifi-
</p>
<p>cant changes in the business environment.
</p>
<p>6.8  Wine Selection Example
</p>
<p>Some fundamentals of the entire business development process can be illustrated 
</p>
<p>by means of the following example relating to the purchase of wine in a restaurant.
</p>
<p>Problem Statement
</p>
<p>To meet the drinking requirements of the party
</p>
<p>Stakeholder group: All members of the party
</p>
<p>Options: Beer, Wine (white or red?), and Water
</p>
<p>Needs analysis: We need 2 bottles of red wine, 1 bottle of white, and some water.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>121
</p>
<p>Capability Gap Analysis
</p>
<p>Needed = 2 red, 1 white, and water
</p>
<p>Available = 1 bottle of white brought by a member of the party. Water is available 
</p>
<p>in restaurant at no cost.
</p>
<p>Gap = 2 bottles of red wine.
</p>
<p>Capability Requirements Statement
</p>
<p>We require 2 bottles of red wine.
</p>
<p>Decision Criteria
</p>
<p>A next step is to establish the criteria on which we are going to make our decision. 
</p>
<p>For wine selection we may decide that our criteria are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Produced in South Australia (or other region preferred by top management)
</p>
<p>&bull; Made from one grape variety&mdash;no cheap blends
</p>
<p>&bull; At least 2 years old&mdash;no vintage-Thursday-week stuff
</p>
<p>&bull; At least 14 % alcohol&mdash;we are serious
</p>

<p>&bull; Buy from the restaurant wine list
</p>
<p>&bull; Buy from the bottle shop down the road.
</p>
<p>Check against criteria&mdash;was there wine on the list that met them. Answer, Yes 
</p>
<p>there were three. Options analysis involved ranking them in order of price. One 
</p>
<p>wine was deemed too expensive and so it was eliminated.

</p>
<p>No one wanted to go out to the bottle shop.
</p>
<p>White wine drinkers now say that one bottle may not be enough.
</p>
<p>Prefeasibility proposal
</p>
<p>Buy the middle priced red wine from the restaurant list&mdash;the cheapest wine was con-
</p>
<p>sidered too high a quality risk. White wine drinkers are to buy extra by the glass if 
</p>
<p>needed. It was noted that this extra white wine requirement should have been identified 
</p>
<p>at the needs analysis stage. A possible issue was whether white wine drinkers should 
</p>
<p>pay separately for extras, but this was countered by the fact that the bottle of white was 
</p>
<p>provided by a member of the party. The prefeasibility proposal was approved.
</p>

</p>
<p>Check current availability of selected wine with waiter. Confirm that the price is as

<p>on list.

<p>6.9  Exercises
</p>
<p>6.9.1  Organizational Structure and Procedures
</p>
<p>Check out the organizational structure for asset management within your own 
</p>
<p>organization. Identify any documented procedures for asset management aspects 
</p>
<p>of business planning, expenditure proposals, and acquisition projects.
</p>
<p>6.9.2  Own Project
</p>
<p>Develop, and present a plan and business case for an asset management develop-
</p>
<p>ment in your organization or similar. The report may represent a project proposal 
</p>
<p>or may extend into implementation and assessment of results. The scale of this and 
</p>
<p>the degree of detail may vary depending on the type of development, which can be 
</p>
<p>a minor improvement proposal or a more significant acquisition or development.
</p>
<p>Typical features to be contained in your report are shown in the Business Case 
</p>
<p>Outline in Sect. 6.3. However, the range of items and level of detail covered in 
</p>
<p>your report should reflect the actual range and relevance of the activity in your 
</p>
<p>project. For smaller projects use the Smaller Business Case Outline from Sect. 6.4.

<p>6.10  Experience Required
</p>
<p>Jock applied for the position of Project Manager for the prefeasibility study for an 
</p>
<p>expansion at the Sandy Point plant. He was doubtful of his chances of getting the 
</p>
<p>job, but was disappointed to find that he was not even short-listed. Rumor had it 
</p>
<p>that the front runner was an experienced project manager from Sydney, but a coun-
</p>
<p>ter rumor said that this guy was fishing for an even bigger job. There were also 
</p>
<p>four or five others who had made the short list.
</p>
<p>Jock and Sheila continued house hunting and Jock continued worrying about 
</p>
<p>money. Sheila gave up work.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have more important priorities now,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>Jock looked out for other job options, but nothing came up. Then out of the 
</p>
<p>blue he had a call from the Human Resource Manager. She said that Ricardo 
</p>
<p>wanted to see him. Ricardo was the CEO and he had only met him once before. 
</p>
<p>That time he had made the mistake of calling him &ldquo;Mr. Ricardo&rdquo;, not realizing that 
</p>
<p>Ricardo was his first name. Ricardo was only a Divisional Manager then and less 
</p>
<p>well known, but still it was an embarrassing moment.
</p>
<p>Jock&rsquo;s meeting with Ricardo went surprisingly well. Ricardo wanted him to run 
</p>
<p>the Sandy Point project!
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Mr. Mello,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me Ricardo,&rdquo; said Ricardo and they both laughed.
</p>
<p>Jock was mystified how he had got the job, but his friend Declan from corpo-
</p>
<p>rate legal said it must have been to do with the bitumen plant. It was after a budget 
</p>
<p>meeting at the bitumen plant that Jock had met Ricardo the first time.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, maybe,&rdquo; said Jock to Declan. &ldquo;I was lumbered with the job of Acting 
</p>
<p>Operations Manager at the bitumen plant when some guy went sick. That was 
</p>
<p>when I realized the meaning of the phrase &lsquo;Asset Death Spiral&rsquo;. The funny thing 
</p>
<p>was that the plant was running above nameplate output and bitumen was selling 
</p>
<p>like hot bitumen.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder the financial boys were happy,&rdquo; said Declan, &ldquo;It was the classic 
</p>
<p>ageing cash cow.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nothing happened,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;My budget was approved.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was at that meeting,&rdquo; said Declan, &ldquo;And it may have seemed like nothing to 
</p>
<p>you but after you left there was a massive argument. The Divisional Financial guy 
</p>
<p>said that your budget proposals for CAPEX and OPEX had no business justifica-
</p>
<p>tion and were just waffly ambit claims. But my boss spoke up for you. It was the 
</p>
<p>first time that I had heard him speak up on anything. It was those photos that you 
</p>
<p>showed at the end of your presentation&mdash;the ones with the leaking drums.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>124 6 Developing a Business Case
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should show those,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;It could have been a CLM.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CLM?&rdquo; said Declan.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Career Limiting Move. I held back the worst ones just in case,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; said Declan, &ldquo;My boss said that if any of that stuff leaked into 
</p>
<p>the creek, and it got out that they had knocked back your budget proposal then it 
</p>
<p>would look bad in court. When he said &ldquo;in court&rdquo; Ricardo really picked up on it. 
</p>
<p>The argument went on, but Ricardo eventually said that he took it that nobody was 
</p>
<p>opposed to the budget submission, and by that time, nobody was.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Later Jock caught up with the HR manager to fix up some details. He could not 
</p>
<p>resist asking how it came about that he got the job when he was not short-listed. 
</p>
<p>She was cagey&mdash;she had done the short-listing.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ricardo looked through all the applicants and said he wanted someone with 
</p>
<p>in-plant experience,&rdquo; she said, turning away.
</p>
<p>Jock had not worked at Sandy Point, but had had 3 years at Jungalup. &ldquo;Those 
</p>
<p>other applicants certainly weren&rsquo;t Desert Rats, more like Gabardine Swine,&rdquo; he 
</p>
<p>mused, with one of his Pop&rsquo;s old phrases coming into play.
</p>
<p>That evening Sheila had more news&mdash;she had found a house. No, she did not 
</p>
<p>care about Jock&rsquo;s stupid decision criteria, the point was that she liked it. Jock 
</p>
<p>looked at the Real Estate Agent&rsquo;s brochure and it seemed that it actually met all 
</p>
<p>his stupid criteria except one&mdash;it was $150,000 over budget. Jock looked at her.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said. Sheila gave him a hug.
</p>
<p>The next day at work Jock worried about what Declan had told him about the 
</p>
<p>inadequacy of his budget proposals at the bitumen plant. If he was going to make a 
</p>
<p>success of the prefeasibility project then he would have to get a grip on the business 
</p>
<p>of creating business cases. And he did not want to go asking the Gabardine Swine.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to make some notes on business case development,&rdquo; said Jock to himself.

<p>Abstract To present the steps involved in implementing an asset acquisition or 
</p>
<p>development plan from project approval to introduction into service. Outcomes 
</p>
<p>After reading this chapter, you will be aware of the steps required to implement 
</p>
<p>an asset acquisition or development plan. You will gain an overall perspective of 
</p>
<p>the steps and activities involved in the implementation of asset development, from 
</p>
<p>the establishment of a project team, through acquisition to commissioning, intro-
</p>
<p>duction into service, and change management. This will assist you in managing or 
</p>
<p>participating in asset development.
</p>
<p>7.1  Asset Development Portfolios1
</p>
<p>At any given point in time there will be many assets in service and many asset 
</p>
<p>development projects at various stages. We shall use the term &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; to mean 
</p>
<p>a set of projects and/or their associated assets. The assets are grouped into several 
</p>
<p>portfolios which correspond to their stage in the life cycle. These portfolios are 
</p>
<p>labeled as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Requirements Portfolio
</p>
<p>&bull; Planning Portfolio
</p>
<p>&bull; Implementation Portfolio
</p>
<p>&bull; In-Service Assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Disposal Portfolio
</p>
<p>We shall consider these portfolios as we discuss the development and lifecycle 
</p>
<p>processes. Figure 7.1 shows the portfolios which assets go through over their life-
</p>
<p>time. It is important to recognize that, although we may initially think of the life 
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55001 Clause 8.1 Operational planning and control: &ldquo;The organization shall &hellip;implement 
processes&hellip;to implement the&hellip;asset management plans&hellip;&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>cycle of particular assets, the asset manager is concerned with a whole range of 
</p>
<p>assets, and that at any one time, different assets are at different stages in their lives.
</p>
<p>7.1.1  Requirements Portfolio
</p>
<p>The Requirements Portfolio consists of projects which are in the concept or gap anal-
</p>
<p>ysis stages and are working toward the capability requirements statement. They are 
</p>
<p>not yet approved for detailed planning. When the capability requirements statement 
</p>
<p>is complete, management will decide if a project is to go forward. If so, the project 
</p>
<p>will move out of the requirements portfolio and go into the planning portfolio.
</p>
<p>7.1.2  Planning Portfolio
</p>
<p>The planning portfolio contains projects which are being planned. In the case 
</p>
<p>of a major development, these plans are developed in two stages, referred to as 
</p>

<p>Pre-feasibility Analysis and Feasibility Analysis. In practice, the level of formality 
</p>
<p>in moving through the planning process will depend on the complexity or other-
</p>
<p>wise of the project and the timing requirements of the development. However, the 
</p>
<p>basic logic of the process is valid, even when some steps are accelerated. When 
</p>
<p>planning is complete, management will decide if a project is to go forward. If so, 
</p>
<p>the project will move out of the planning portfolio and into the implementation 
</p>
<p>portfolio.
</p>
<p>7.1.3  Implementation Portfolio
</p>
<p>The implementation portfolio consists of projects which are being implemented. 
</p>
<p>This involves the acquisition and implementation of the capability and its intro-
</p>
<p>duction into service.
</p>
<p>7.1.4  In-Service Assets
</p>
<p>These are the assets which are currently in-service, being used in operations and 
</p>
<p>which require maintenance and logistic support.
</p>
<p>7.1.5  Disposal Portfolio
</p>
<p>These are the assets which are in the process of being disposed of.
</p>
<p>7.2  Project Team and Activities
</p>
<p>The requirements and planning stages of business development projects were con-
</p>
<p>sidered in earlier chapters. The phases of capability requirements analysis, pre-fea-
</p>
<p>sibility analysis, and feasibility analysis establish the need, the asset requirements, 
</p>
<p>the project plan, and the business case covering all aspects of the capability and its 
</p>
<p>logistic support. A project budget will have been prepared and approved. The next 
</p>
<p>step is to carry out the acquisition or development.
</p>
<p>7.2.1  Team Functions
</p>
<p>For a major development, a project team is established and a development project 
</p>
<p>schedule is prepared. The project team will address the following roles, the num-
</p>
<p>ber of persons involved being dependent on the size of the project. Some roles 
</p>
<p>may be shared across projects, depending on the volume of work involved.

</p>
<p>&bull; Project Manager
</p>
<p>&bull; Assistant Project Managers for major subsidiary areas, geographically or techni-
</p>
<p>cally, e.g., mechanical systems, electrical systems, instrumentation systems, and 
</p>
<p>site construction
</p>
<p>&bull; Logistic support manager
</p>
<p>&bull; Scheduler
</p>
<p>&bull; Commercial manager
</p>
<p>&bull; Contracts manager
</p>
<p>&bull; Technical and administrative personnel supporting the above as required by the 
</p>
<p>volume of work.
</p>
<p>The members of the project team may be a dedicated business developmental 
</p>
<p>group, may be sourced from relevant operational areas, or from asset management. 
</p>
<p>In many cases, the asset management group will be either in a full project 
</p>
<p>management role, or providing a major part of the development team.
</p>
<p>7.2.2  Project Management
</p>
<p>The implementation of development plans has three main stages, first the creation 
</p>
<p>and letting of contracts for acquisition, development, and/or construction, second, 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the defined work, and third, introduction into service of the 
</p>
<p>new capability. A standard project management or work management software 
</p>
<p>tool should be adopted as an aid to managing any large project. Planning and con-
</p>
<p>trol is required for:
</p>
<p>&bull; Activities
</p>
<p>&bull; Resources
</p>
<p>&bull; Resource allocation
</p>
<p>&bull; Critical path
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition procedure
</p>
<p>&bull; Progress reporting
</p>
<p>If the resources being used for a project overlap with those used for maintenance 
</p>
<p>work, then it is desirable to manage all the activities in the one database.
</p>
<p>7.2.3  Activities
</p>
<p>The range of activities will typically include the following:
</p>
<p> a. Create a Project Management Plan for the development, including a list of 
</p>
<p>activities and a schedule
</p>
<p> b. Create a functional specification document and selection criteria for tendering 
</p>
<p>against
</p>
<p> c. Incorporate through life support requirements</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>129
</p>
<p> d. Create an Invitation to Register Interest if required
</p>
<p> e. Create request for tender document
</p>
<p> f. Tender evaluation and supplier selection process
</p>
<p> g. Pre-contract testing and evaluation against specifications
</p>
<p> h. Contract negotiation and agreement
</p>
<p> i. Acquisition
</p>
<p> j. Management of assets under construction
</p>
<p> k. Quality assurance
</p>
<p> l. Implement logistic support plan
</p>
<p> m. Installation
</p>
<p> n. Commissioning
</p>
<p> o. Pre-acceptance checks
</p>
<p> p. Equipment acceptance
</p>
<p> q. Implement training plan starting with train-the-trainer
</p>
<p> r. Operations and maintenance personnel to be trained and deployed
</p>
<p> s. Introduction into service
</p>
<p> t. Disposal of replaced equipment.
</p>
<p>7.3  Project Milestones
</p>
<p>Stages in a project can be identified by milestones such as the following:
</p>
<p>a. Requirements defined
</p>
<p>b. Design or acquisition specification complete
</p>
<p>c. Tendering complete
</p>
<p>d. Pre-contract testing and evaluation complete
</p>
<p>e. Contract let
</p>
<p>f. Installation complete
</p>
<p>g. Commissioning complete
</p>
<p>h. Pre-acceptance testing complete
</p>
<p>i. Final acceptance
</p>
<p>j. Operational.
</p>
<p>7.4  Reliability Centered Procurement
</p>
<p>Reliability Centered Procurement is the concept of considering the long-term 
</p>
<p>reliability and sustainability of equipment at the procurement stage. It involves 
</p>
<p>making decisions which make it easy to subsequently maintain and sustain 
</p>
<p>the equipment, and to ensure that it is reliable both initially and through life. It 
</p>
<p>involves giving weight to the selection of equipment which is known to be reli-
</p>
<p>able and maintainable and for which logistic support is most readily delivered. In 
</p>
<p>7.2 Project Team and Activities</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>130 7 Implementing Development Plans
</p>
<p>practice, this often means selecting equipment which is available off-the-shelf and 
</p>
<p>which is common use already. It involves checking for reliability and satisfactory 
</p>
<p>installation at the time of acquisition. Key factors are equipment commonality, 
</p>
<p>reliability, and maintainability appraisal, and acceptance testing.
</p>
<p>7.4.1  Equipment Commonality
</p>
<p>Commonality of equipment and systems helps to ensure a minimum of problems 
</p>
<p>in operation and support. Commonality facilitates the achievement of high stand-
</p>
<p>ards of productivity, reliability, and availability, by avoiding unnecessary opera-
</p>
<p>tional and logistic problems. It involves applying the following principles:
</p>
<p>a. Keep to common equipment and to common systems across all sections of the 
</p>
<p>organization. This minimizes diversity in operation, training, and maintenance, 
</p>
<p>reduces total spares requirement by type and quantity; minimizes demands for 
</p>
<p>tools, test equipment, range of know-how, and facilitates cannibalization.
</p>
<p>b. There can be negative aspects in reducing the diversity of systems to an abso-
</p>
<p>lute minimum. If a significant fault occurs it will affect all items, although 
</p>
<p>there is then a counter argument that this will mean a rapid focus on solving 
</p>
<p>the problem. It can also mean that the user is committed to just one supplier 
</p>
<p>who may exploit this as a commercial advantage. A compromise is to use two 
</p>
<p>suppliers, striking a balance between the benefits of reduced diversity and 
</p>
<p>supplier competition.
</p>
<p>c. Purchase items which are of a type widely used in the community&mdash;operational 
</p>
<p>and maintenance skills and spares will be available and relatively cheap.
</p>
<p>d. Purchase items locally manufactured (if any), assembled, or widely sup-
</p>
<p>ported&mdash;operational and maintenance skills and spares will be available and 
</p>
<p>relatively cheap.
</p>
<p>7.4.2  Performance Standards
</p>
<p>Consider performance standards in the following areas:
</p>
<p>a. Functional performance
</p>
<p>b. Operability
</p>
<p>c. Reliability
</p>
<p>d. Maintainability
</p>
<p>e. Logistic supportability
</p>
<p>f. Compatibility with, and integration with, related systems
</p>
<p>g. Health, safety, and environmental factors.
</p>
<p>Resist political or prestige purchases where possible.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>131
</p>
<p>7.4.3  Test and Evaluation Criteria
</p>
<p>Test and evaluation criteria are required in order to ensure that equipments per-
</p>
<p>form to a sufficient standard to deliver the required capability. At the preacqui-
</p>
<p>sition stage, relevant standards and tests should be specified and a test and 
</p>
<p>evaluation management plan should be created. Ideally, some testing of items 
</p>
<p>should take place early, so that a realistic appreciation of expectations of equip-
</p>
<p>ment can be formed, and test criteria specified in the contract phase. Equipment is 
</p>
<p>usually specified to prescribed standards such as ISO, BS, DIN, or EN.
</p>
<p>7.4.4  Preferred Suppliers
</p>
<p>The principles just outlined, particularly regarding commonality, may conflict with 
</p>
<p>the requirements of open tendering. A compromise position can involve the use of 
</p>
<p>preferred (or accredited) suppliers, whose technical and logistic support creden-
</p>
<p>tials have been established in advance.
</p>
<p>Suppliers are invited to prequalify as accredited suppliers. A panel is 
</p>
<p>established which determines the range and quality of equipment which a given 
</p>
<p>supplier can provide, the extent and location of logistic support, and the ability 
</p>
<p>to work with users to meet needs over a period of time. It is important to allow 
</p>
<p>for new entrants and business transparency. The market generally should be kept 
</p>
<p>informed of needs and be allowed to respond to developments and requirements as 
</p>
<p>technologies evolve.
</p>
<p>Where several manufacturers produce to an established international standard, 
</p>
<p>it can be difficult to distinguish between suppliers. Life cycle costing provides a 
</p>
<p>basis for taking into account factors beyond the initial acquisition cost. However, 
</p>
<p>the operating expenses in the life cycle cost are often a less firm than the initial 
</p>
<p>capital costs. Ultimately, a tender selection problem remains to be resolved by a 
</p>
<p>combination of performance, cost, logistic support analysis, and judgment.
</p>
<p>7.5  Evaluation of Suppliers
</p>
<p>Before committing to a supplier, assess the potential ability of the supplier to 
</p>
<p>deliver the proposed capability. This will involve assessing technical and manage-
</p>
<p>rial competence, financial viability, track record, and future potential. There is a 
</p>
<p>tendency to play safe and prefer larger organizations to smaller ones. Look par-
</p>
<p>ticularly at the competence of a supplier in close relation to the specific capability 
</p>
<p>which is sought. One supplier may match your need well, whereas another sup-
</p>
<p>plier may be relying on ambit claims of competence which do not include the spe-
</p>
<p>cific area required by the current project.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>132 7 Implementing Development Plans
</p>
<p>7.6  Equipment Selection and Trials and Acceptance
</p>
<p>Formal tests should be organized as part of the acquisition process, both in 
</p>
<p>deciding on the acquisition and in verifying the equipment selected. The results 
</p>
<p>obtained in the application of the test and evaluation plan should form key mile-
</p>
<p>stones in the subsequent acquisition process.
</p>
<p>a. Carry out a formal appraisal of operations, reliability, and maintain-
</p>
<p>ability. This will involve setting up a trial in order to check that equip-
</p>
<p>ment performance is up to expectations in terms of operating, reliability 
</p>
<p>and maintainability criteria. For equipment with design features special to 
</p>
<p>your application, a Reliability Centered Maintenance approach should be 
</p>
<p>adopted, reviewing equipment functions, potential failure modes, potential 
</p>
<p>effects of failure including safety and environmental effects, and related 
</p>
<p>maintenance or inspection tasks.
</p>
<p>b. In assessing a new type of equipment, consider (and cost) the training and 
</p>
<p>logistic support required.
</p>
<p>c. Ensure that products are in good condition and meet necessary specifications 
</p>
<p>before acceptance.
</p>
<p>d. Pay attention to installation and set up.

<p>updated to reflect the actual equipment selection choices made in the acquisition process.
</p>
<p>7.8  Financial and Contract Process
</p>
<p>Figure 7.3 summarizes the steps to be taken.
</p>
<p>7.9  Project Maturity Status
</p>
<p>At any one time, a portfolio of implementation projects will be current. Figure 7.4 
</p>
<p>shows a scheme for describing the maturity status of these projects. As a project 
</p>
<p>matures, its total maturity score will progress towards 25 and we can monitor pro-
</p>
<p>gress and manage priorities by reference to the maturity score at any point.
</p>
<p>7.10  Assigning Responsibilities
</p>
<p>In any project or operational situation it is important that people understand what 
</p>
<p>their responsibilities are. A convenient way of considering this for any given 
</p>
<p>function is to consider who is responsible for carrying out the function, who is

<p>accountable for the results, who needs to be consulted about the activities and who 
</p>
<p>needs to be informed. This is referred to as a RACI analysis.
</p>
<p>A RACI chart is a chart in which the columns contain personnel functions and the 
</p>
<p>rows contain activities. The cells contain one or more of the letters R, A, C, I indicating:
</p>
<p>R = Responsible
</p>
<p>A = Accountable
</p>
<p>C = Consulted
</p>
<p>I = Informed
</p>
<p>Although this approach is described as RACI, in terms of seniority of roles, 
</p>
<p>Accountable is the highest. Thus the technique is really better described as ARCI, 
</p>
<p>but the abbreviation does not work out so well. The Accountable person has the 
</p>
<p>overall responsibility (!), the Responsible person does the day to day management, 
</p>
<p>the Consulted persons are drawn on for specific knowledge or expertise and the 
</p>
<p>Informed persons are kept informed of progress.
</p>
<p>Only one Accountable and one Responsible entry should appear in any row.

</p>
<p>7.11  Project Management Reports
</p>
<p>Standard reporting methods must be established for projects. Examples of types of 
</p>
<p>reports are as follows:
</p>
<p>7.11.1  Topics
</p>
<p>a. Financial overview report
</p>
<p>i. Monthly
</p>
<p>ii. Cumulative
</p>
<p>iii. Forecast
</p>
<p>b. Project overview report; progress to date, forecast, and risks
</p>
<p>c. Recent activities and immediately forthcoming activities
</p>
<p>d. Logistic support and sustainment, overview report
</p>
<p>e. Capital budget progress reports
</p>
<p>f. Project summary report.
</p>
<p>7.11.2  Financial Overview Report
</p>
<p>The financial overview report contains information on the following points:
</p>
<p>&bull; Project total budget
</p>
<p>&bull; Project financial status in relation to planned milestones
</p>
<p>&bull; Actual expenditure to date
</p>
<p>&bull; Planned expenditure to date
</p>
<p>&bull; Planned future expenditure
</p>
<p>&bull; Budget remaining
</p>
<p>&bull; Budgetary status of risks remaining and retired
</p>
<p>&bull; Contingency used
</p>
<p>&bull; Contingency remaining.
</p>
<p>7.12  Project Progress Monitoring
</p>
<p>Once a capital project has been approved, it enters the implementation portfolio. Its 
</p>
<p>progress is then tracked and monitored at project review meetings which are held 
</p>
<p>regularly (weekly or monthly) and are attended by the relevant management team 
</p>
<p>7.10 Assigning Responsibilities</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>136 7 Implementing Development Plans
</p>
<p>members and stakeholders of the project. The regular meetings are to make sure that 
</p>
<p>the projects keep progressing and any potential issues are identified and actioned.
</p>
<p>For the portfolio of implementation projects, progress can be monitored with 
</p>
<p>the help of a one-line progress report per project, indicating the status in respect to 
</p>
<p>the following features. Traffic light symbols or smiley face symbols may be used 
</p>
<p>to give a rapid visual summary of project status.
</p>
<p>&bull; physical progress relative to plan,
</p>
<p>&bull; financial status relative to budget,
</p>
<p>&bull; current problem severity,
</p>
<p>&bull; risk severity, and
</p>
<p>&bull; financial forecast.
</p>
<p>Management should then drill down to more detail on under-performing features. 
</p>
<p>As the project proceeds, monitoring should cover the following points.
</p>
<p>&bull; Executive summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Project background and aims
</p>
<p>&bull; Current overall project status
</p>
<p>&bull; Status in relation to in-service date
</p>
<p>&bull; Schedule progress issues&mdash;any activities delayed and their potential effect
</p>
<p>&bull; Budget status planned versus actual, budget projection, contingency used, and 
</p>
<p>remaining
</p>
<p>&bull; Projected performance assessment of primary system
</p>
<p>&bull; Current and projected status of remaining items of the capability
</p>
<p>&bull; Stability of requirements
</p>
<p>&bull; Current feedback from stakeholders
</p>
<p>&bull; Performance and potential performance of the contractors/suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Report on resourcing of the development project
</p>
<p>&bull; Report on progress with logistic support plan
</p>
<p>&bull; Current issues summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Risks.
</p>
<p>7.12.1  Delays and Overruns
</p>
<p>Sometimes a project will hit a roadblock, that is, a major problem which, unless 
</p>
<p>and until it is resolved, will prevent the project proceeding. For example, in a pro-
</p>
<p>ject to upgrade a load carrying vehicle, it was planned to install a larger engine 
</p>
<p>than that used in the original version. However, tests showed that the new engine 
</p>
<p>overheated when installed in the original layout and that major design revision 
</p>
<p>was required. Unfortunately, the project manager, the stakeholders, and sen-
</p>
<p>ior personnel in the organization continued to focus on schedules and budgets 
</p>
<p>as though the engine overheating issue did not exist, or was about to be quickly 
</p>
<p>resolved. In fact, the redesign problem was very challenging and a 2-year delay 
</p>
<p>occurred. Money could have been saved by halting many activities while the 
</p>
<p>engine heating problem was resolved.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>137
</p>
<p>Performance monitoring and solution risk are important aspects of project man-
</p>
<p>agement that can easily be sidelined in the wealth of detail and the political commit-
</p>
<p>ment to schedules, budgets, and announcements. Project managers need to have the 
</p>
<p>following questions firmly in mind in regard to technical performance issues:
</p>
<p>&bull; Does it work?
</p>
<p>&bull; Does is perform to specification?
</p>
<p>&bull; If not, can it possibly/probably be fixed&mdash;indicate risks
</p>
<p>&bull; If so, is there a reasonable plan to probably fix it?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is there an acceptable performance level if the fix does not work?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is there an acceptable performance level if the item does not meet the original 
</p>
<p>specifications?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is there a contingency plan?
</p>
<p>&bull; Should we declare a formal delay?
</p>
<p>&bull; Should we abandon the project?
</p>
<p>Sadly, these questions may be pushed under the carpet, until a multi-billion 
</p>
<p>disaster occurs.
</p>
<p>7.12.2  Scope Creep
</p>
<p>Ideally, the scope of a project should not change once it has started. In reality, the world 
</p>
<p>does not stand still, so that, while we should be generally resistant to changes in project 
</p>
<p>scope, they may sometimes represent the best option for the organization as a whole.
</p>
<p>Initial plans for a footbridge over the river in Brisbane were changed midstream 
</p>
<p>to reduce the slope of the approaches and add a lift. This greatly improved the 
</p>
<p>practicality of the bridge for cyclists and wheel chair users. At the time of these 
</p>
<p>changes, the bridge was described in the media as being late and over-budget, but 
</p>
<p>the final product was successful, very well patronized, and was built at reasonable 
</p>
<p>cost in terms of what was actually delivered, though this was about twice the cost 
</p>
<p>of the version that was originally planned. This positive example, however, is not 
</p>
<p>intended to excuse scope creep in general.
</p>
<p>7.12.3  Project Progress Report Examples
</p>
<p>Examples of some graphically focussed project progress reports, based on a plant 
</p>
<p>upgrade project, are shown in Figs. 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9.
</p>
<p>7.13  Project Portfolio Management
</p>
<p>At any one time a number of projects will be active in the business development port-
</p>
<p>folios. In managing a portfolio, changes due to delays from many causes both inter-
</p>
<p>nal and external are likely to occur. Occasional speeding up, cost overruns and scope

<p>support dependent on project size and complexity. The commissioning manager 
</p>
<p>will develop a commissioning plan during the feasibility stage and will man-
</p>
<p>age its implementation. The performance of the plant will be checked and any 
</p>
<p>operating or functional issues will be addressed. This might include such factors 
</p>
<p>as failure to meet performance ratings, leaks, equipment failures, or premature 
</p>
<p>wear. Issues of safety in operation and of safe access for operators, maintainers, 
</p>
<p>and materials must be addressed. Operations and maintenance should be repre-
</p>
<p>sented as key stakeholders in the commissioning stage. It is important to have 
</p>
<p>logistic support arrangements in place before introduction into service; other-
</p>
<p>wise, users gallop off with the equipment and there is no support when prob-
</p>
<p>lems arise.
</p>
<p>7.14.1  Operational Readiness
</p>
<p>Operational readiness involves getting new or upgraded plant to the point where it 
</p>
<p>can be handed over to operations. A site operations representative should be nomi-
</p>
<p>nated, to represent the interests of operations in the installation, commissioning, 
</p>
<p>and operational readiness processes. Defects identified during reliability testing

</p>
<p>or during commissioning should be addressed before acceptance of the equip-
</p>
<p>ment, and safe operating procedures must be confirmed before handing over of 
</p>
<p>the equipment to operations. It is common to find that there are some items that 
</p>
<p>are less than perfect and lists are made of outstanding tasks. These lists are called 
</p>
<p>punch lists. The punch list work is then completed, or some items may be agreed 
</p>
<p>to be left until later.
</p>
<p>Plans are to be developed for the transition from the commissioning project 
</p>
<p>to operation at design capacity. The plans developed for all logistic support and 
</p>
<p>information technology issues should come to fruition prior to the equipment 
</p>
<p>entering service.
</p>
<p>7.14.2  Training
</p>
<p>Training is an important aspect of introduction into service. For both operators and 
</p>
<p>maintainers, the following activities should be completed prior to introduction into 
</p>
<p>service:
</p>
<p>&bull; Preparation of train-the-trainer material
</p>
<p>&bull; Preparation of training material
</p>
<p>&bull; Train-the-trainer training
</p>
<p>&bull; Training for operators and maintainers.
</p>
<p>The operating and maintenance procedures must include the consideration and 
</p>
<p>treatment of hazards, and contingency plans.
</p>
<p>7.14.3  Introduction into Service
</p>
<p>A key aspect of implementation is the introduction of assets into service.  Prior to 
</p>
<p>introduction the following steps are important:
</p>
<p>a. Logistic support developed and ready
</p>
<p>b. Training developed
</p>
<p>c. Training completed for relevant personnel
</p>

</p>
<p>7.15  Change Management2
</p>
<p>Change Management is a formal approach to managing workplace changes, 
</p>
<p>intended to ensure that changes are assessed, managed, effectively controlled, 
</p>
<p>communicated, and implemented successfully. Whenever changes are proposed, a 
</p>
<p>change management process should be applied. The aim is to ensure maximum 
</p>
<p>benefit is achieved from the proposed changes and that there are no adverse 
</p>
<p>effects to health and safety, no damage to plant or equipment, that legislative 
</p>
<p>requirements are upheld, and negative impacts on performance are avoided.
</p>
<p>Managers should think through the impact of changes on all aspects of work 
</p>
<p>activities during the planning process, although it must be accepted that not every 
</p>
<p>potential impact of a change will be completely anticipated.
</p>
<p>In any change, workers will want to protect their jobs and status and that of 
</p>
<p>their immediate colleagues, and change is much simpler if these factors can be 
</p>
<p>respected. Examine the implications of change from a worker/user point of view 
</p>
<p>and consider the redeployment, training, or redundancy issues in advance of 
</p>
<p>implementing change. Pilot studies, trial implementations of limited scope, and 
</p>
<p>evolutionary changes may help. Ultimately, however, management must be pre-
</p>
<p>pared to take the responsibility for whatever hard decisions may be required.
</p>
<p>Having decided on a change, conversion training from current processes and pro-
</p>
<p>cedures must be provided. Involve the supervisor and other stakeholders, as local 
</p>
<p>ownership of the solution is essential. Develop an implementation kit containing all 
</p>
<p>the necessary equipment, documentation, and training procedures. Provide instruc-
</p>
<p>tions, procedures, and check lists. Ensure sustainability of the solution through 
</p>
<p>supporting facilities and materials as needed. If the new solution only works when 
</p>
<p>senior management is enforcing it, then it is likely to fail. Ensure that necessary sup-
</p>
<p>port is ongoing. If it really does not work, take a fall back position.
</p>
<p>Danger points on implementation of a desirable change occur on the with-
</p>
<p>drawal of an implementation team and on a break in activity, such as a plant shut-
</p>
<p>down or a holiday period. Unless the change is well bedded down, operators may 
</p>
<p>revert to the old way of doing things and the benefits are lost.
</p>
<p>7.15.1  Change Analysis
</p>
<p>Factors to be considered in change analysis include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Have a formal change proposal and evaluation procedure
</p>
<p>&bull; Details of the proposed change
</p>
<p>&bull; Reasons for change
</p>
<p>2 ISO 55001/2 Clause 8.2 Management of Change: &ldquo;Risks associated with any planned &hellip; 
change shall be assessed&hellip; The organization shall ensure that such risks are managed&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>&bull; Extent of change, e.g., retrofit or not
</p>
<p>&bull; Resources required for change
</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate impact across all aspects of the capability
</p>
<p>&bull; Operational implications
</p>
<p>&bull; Logistic support implications
</p>
<p>&bull; Human resource implications
</p>
<p>&bull; Proposed timing
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost and benefit analysis.
</p>
<p>7.15.2  Change Management Plan
</p>
<p>A change management plan will involve such features as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Explanation of change and reasons for change
</p>
<p>&bull; Stakeholder involvement
</p>
<p>&bull; Operational plan, e.g., down time required
</p>
<p>&bull; Change/Modification details and procedure
</p>
<p>&bull; Areas impacted with details, e.g.,
</p>
<p>&ndash; Business
</p>
<p>&ndash; Mechanical
</p>
<p>&ndash; Electrical
</p>
<p>&ndash; Chemical
</p>
<p>&ndash; Process
</p>
<p>&ndash; Health and Safety
</p>
<p>&ndash; Environment
</p>
<p>&ndash; Regulations
</p>
<p>&ndash; Stores
</p>
<p>&ndash; Supply Chain
</p>
<p>&bull; Implementation plan, where, when
</p>
<p>&bull; Modification kits, tools, materials, and components
</p>
<p>&bull; Documentation changes
</p>
<p>&bull; Conversion training from current processes and procedures
</p>
<p>&bull; Disposal considerations
</p>
<p>&bull; Configuration update.
</p>
<p>7.15.3  Approval of Changes
</p>
<p>Changes will normally require the approval of an appropriate technical authority, 
</p>
<p>typically the relevant engineering manager.

<p>7.16.2  Pacific Earth Moving Part 3
</p>
<p>Pacific Earth Moving has obtained financial support and Board approval to 
</p>
<p>purchase a range of additional earth moving equipment. The plan has been 
</p>
<p>approved in principle, the main equipment to be acquired has been agreed, and an 
</p>
<p>indicative budget has been approved.
</p>
<p>The next step is to spell out more detail of the acquisition, including support 
</p>
<p>facilities and services, and to create tender documents. The acquisition process 
</p>
<p>will then proceed. The size and complexity of the acquisitions are greater than 
</p>
<p>those previously undertaken by the company. Your group has been asked to advice 
</p>
<p>on the following points:
</p>
<p>a. What organizational structure is needed to effect the acquisition process?
</p>
<p>b. What activities will the acquisition management group undertake?
</p>
<p>c. What types of management monitoring and reporting will be required?
</p>
<p>d. What types of risk may occur in such projects?

<p>2. Identify five general business considerations that should be taken into account 
</p>
<p>in an asset development plan.
</p>
<p>  Any five of the following:
</p>
<p>a. Meet the market need in terms of key outputs, characteristics, and features.
</p>
<p>b. Profitable.
</p>
<p>c. Affordable.

</p>
<p>j. Meet design, environmental and safety standards.
</p>
<p>k. Life adequate.
</p>
<p>l. Retain some flexibility for revision as the acquisition develops.
</p>
<p>3. Who are the stakeholders in an asset development project and how should their 
</p>
<p>views be considered?
</p>
<p>a. Stakeholders are those people and functions that will be affected by the pro-
</p>
<p>posed plan. Survey their opinions and take them into account in developing, 
</p>
<p>or even abandoning the plan. If necessary, form a stakeholder committee. 
</p>
<p>For asset developments, the stakeholders normally include the relevant busi-
</p>
<p>ness, operations, and maintenance managers and staff. Where customers 
</p>
<p>and suppliers are affected, they will potentially form part of the stakeholder 
</p>
<p>group, subject to business confidentiality. The plan is more likely to succeed 
</p>
<p>if the relevant groups have contributed to its development. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>some stakeholders may resist the plan, particularly if they see it working 
</p>
<p>against their interest, and it will be necessary to use management judgement 
</p>
<p>and authority to present the rationalization for the plan from the overall 
</p>
<p>business viewpoint. But suffer fools gladly&mdash;they may be right.
</p>
<p>4. What is meant by &ldquo;level of service&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>a. Level of service relates to setting standards in such areas as performance, 
</p>
<p>availability, timeliness of response to failures, and provision of informa-
</p>
<p>tion when problems arise. Level of service monitoring requires corre-
</p>
<p>sponding performance indicators. As an example, in a railway system, a 
</p>
<p>performance indicator is the proportion of services that are not canceled, 
</p>
<p>and a corresponding level of service is a specification that this should be, 
</p>
<p>say, 97 % or more.

<p>6. How might you track the maturity status of projects in the Planning Portfolio?
</p>
<p>a. Figure 7.4 shows a scoring system which enables management to track 
</p>
<p>the maturity status of these projects. As a project matures its total maturity 
</p>
<p>score will progress towards 25 and we can monitor progress and manage

<p>7.19  An Acquisition Decision
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to have to get a new car,&rdquo; said Sheila. &ldquo;We need a four-seater at 
</p>
<p>least, with somewhere to put a pram and a baby back-pack, besides shopping.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Their present car was an MG two-seater sports model that dated back to Jock&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>bachelor days. Jock said that he would look into the possibilities.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cougar SS seems like a good option,&rdquo; said Jock later that week. He was 
</p>
<p>looking at a car magazine which gave the vehicle an enthusiastic write-up.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sports sedan with a good sized boot and a terrific performance,&rdquo; he 
</p>
<p>said.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Sheila. She turned over a few pages.</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-14777-2_16">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-14777-2_16</a></div>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>147
</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks more realistic,&rdquo; she said, and handed the magazine back to Jock, 
</p>
<p>open at a page which showed a picture of a medium sized Toyota hatchback.
</p>
<p>Jock groaned inwardly.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to be able to put things in the back, without having to lift them over 
</p>
<p>a sill,&rdquo; said Sheila. &ldquo;And anyway, we don&rsquo;t need fancy performance for doddling 
</p>
<p>around suburbia.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to get on with buying it,&rdquo; Sheila went on. &ldquo;We can trade in the MG at 
</p>
<p>the Toyota dealer on Burwood Highway.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said.
</p>
<p>Jock&rsquo;s domestic scene was looking good, but there was trouble with the project 
</p>
<p>that he was managing. A few days later at work he headed for the water cooler 
</p>
<p>only to find his boss, Sam, already there.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Project 413 is behind schedule,&rdquo; said Sam, who was not strong on small talk.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pressuring Dead Sea Systems but these software integration projects 
</p>
<p>are pretty difficult to push along,&rdquo; said Jock. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried some strong arm stuff 
</p>
<p>already. I&rsquo;ll have another go at getting to the bottom of the problem with the pro-
</p>
<p>ject people there.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, but don&rsquo;t let them pass the blame back to us,&rdquo; said Sam as he left.
</p>
<p>Veronica, Jock&rsquo;s favorite work buddy arrived as Sam departed.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble in&rsquo;t mill?&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t get any sense out of Dead Sea on this 413 project,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nephew works for them,&rdquo; said Veronica as Jock was about to start on a 
</p>
<p>tirade of criticism of Dead Sea.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;Maybe you could get some inside info?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything new from Dead Sea,&rdquo; asked Jock when he met Veronica at the water 
</p>
<p>cooler a week later. Veronica didn&rsquo;t answer directly.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Software projects are difficult to manage, and it&rsquo;s not always the project peo-
</p>
<p>ple&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me something!&rdquo; said Jock. &ldquo;I remember a project that I was on for St 
</p>
<p>Helens Glass. They asked our team leader how long it would take and he said, 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;6 months&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was January at the time, and the St Helens guy said, &ldquo;So you can finish it by 
</p>
<p>July!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said our guy, &ldquo;If we get the go-ahead today.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then nothing happened until another meeting in May, when the St Helens guy 
</p>
<p>asked if the software would be ready by July &lsquo;as promised&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean that you are approving the project?&rdquo; our manager said.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they did. It still took 6 months, but somehow the delay had become our 
</p>
<p>fault.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of witty sayings about software projects and they are all true,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>said Jock. &ldquo;Like&mdash;projects quickly become 90 % complete and then remain that 
</p>
<p>way indefinitely.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, you can browbeat a programmer into committing to a deadline, but you 
</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t make him meet it,&rdquo; added Veronica.

<p>148 7 Implementing Development Plans
</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what is happening at Dead Sea,&rdquo; said Jock trying to get to the point.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well everything on Project 413 was given top priority after they got a rocket 
</p>
<p>from us earlier, but some of the work is sub-contracted to Uluru Developments and 
</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t delivered.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sub-contractors are the prime contractors responsibility,&rdquo; said Jock, 
</p>
<p>feeling stern and worried at the same time. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know anyone at 
</p>
<p>Uluru do you?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Veronica.
</p>
<p>Jock wasn&rsquo;t supposed to deal directly with sub-contractors but after a while he 
</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t resist. He rang Uluru and asked if anyone knew about Project 413. He got 
</p>
<p>through to Charlie McSporran.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your not related to the McSporrans of Dunbar Street are you?&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Charlie, &ldquo;I went to Dunbar Street Primary right enough.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>It took them half an hour to get on to Project 413.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hold up?&rdquo; asked Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you blokes,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get on with our part until your 
</p>
<p>development boys release the operating specs for the radiation sensors.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Jock nearly choked.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you in contact with at our end?&rdquo; he said.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stonewall Jackson,&rdquo; said Charlie.
</p>
<p>Later Jock wondered if there was any solution to stuff ups like Project 413. 
</p>
<p>The best he could come up with was the two phrases &ldquo;Date of Decision&rdquo; and &ldquo;In 
</p>
<p>Service Date&rdquo;. If every manager had to specify those in every meeting and every 
</p>
<p>report, maybe some sort of awareness would creep in, he thought.</p>

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe the technique of life cycle costing 
</p>
<p>and to illustrate it with an example. We also develop a life cycle asset management 
</p>
<p>plan for an item. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will understand the rea-
</p>
<p>son for life cycle costing and have seen a check list of factors that go into a life 
</p>
<p>cycle costing analysis. You will have seen an example of a life cycle cost analysis. 
</p>
<p>You will understand the concept of a life cycle asset management plan.
</p>
<p>8.1  Life Cycle Costing
</p>
<p>Life Cycle Costing (LCC)1,2,3,4 is the estimation of the cost of acquiring, commis-
</p>
<p>sioning, operating, maintaining, and disposing of equipment. It is a &ldquo;cradle to 
</p>
<p>grave&rdquo; cost analysis. The aim of life cycle costing is to ensure that all relevant 
</p>
<p>costs are identified, and that through life costs are considered at the planning, 
</p>
<p>acquisition, and budgeting stages.
</p>
<p>8.1.1  Why Do We Need Life Cycle Costing?
</p>
<p>We need life cycle costing to assist us with the following types of asset manage-
</p>
<p>ment decisions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition decisions, with consideration of the life cycle costs of different 
</p>
<p>acquisition options
</p>
<p>&bull; Life cycle asset management planning as an input into determining the 
</p>
<p> operating and maintenance resources and budget for in-service assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement decisions.

<p>150 8 Life Cycle Costing
</p>
<p>8.2  Acquisition Decisions
</p>
<p>The first reason for carrying out life cycle costing arises in the preacquisition stage 
</p>
<p>of an asset, where we need to determine life cycle costs, initially at a broad brush 
</p>
<p>level, to assist with acquisition analysis and decision making among possible 
</p>
<p>options. The key point is to avoid doing something stupid, such as neglecting or 
</p>
<p>badly under or over estimating a major cost area.
</p>
<p>The aim of life cycle costing at the acquisition stage is to ensure that all rele-
</p>
<p>vant costs are identified, and that through life costs are adequately considered. Life 
</p>
<p>cycle costing is applied initially at a broad brush level. Costs will later be refined 
</p>
<p>in the course of making a firm acquisition decision.
</p>
<p>Life cycle costing considers acquisition cost but also gives attention to oper-
</p>
<p>ating costs, consumables, life of the item, spares costs, life of key components, 
</p>
<p>diversity of spares and tools, and issues related to training.
</p>
<p>Figure 8.1 illustrates the stages in the life cycle of an equipment, showing sche-
</p>
<p>matically the cumulative cost and the opportunity to influence costs. The opportu-
</p>
<p>nity to influence costs is concentrated at the planning and acquisition stages. It is 
</p>
<p>important in selecting equipment that we take due account of logistic support con-
</p>
<p>siderations, otherwise equipment support costs, performance and availability may 
</p>
<p>produce poor results that negate perceived advantages in initial cost. In Fig. 8.1 
</p>
<p>the acquisition costs are dominant, and this is often the case for passive items. 
</p>
<p>However, for items such as vehicles or plant, or anything that consumes fuel, the 
</p>
<p>operating costs may be the most significant cost area. In this case operating costs 
</p>
<p>should be an important consideration in equipment decisions.
</p>
<p>An illustration of the application of life cycle costing relates to a company 
</p>
<p>which builds prisons. In some cases it will be competing for a contract to design 
</p>
<p>and build a prison and then hand it over to another organization to run it. In other 
</p>
<p>cases the contract will be to design, build, and operate the prison. In the first case, 
</p>
<p>the company will create a design which is inexpensive to build, but gives little 
</p>
<p>attention to the operational aspect. If it did otherwise it would almost certainly not

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>151
</p>
<p>win the contract because its tender price would be too high. In the second case, 
</p>
<p>the design would take account of the fact that the company would itself be operat-
</p>
<p>ing the prison, and they would therefore aim to minimize costs over the whole life 
</p>
<p>cycle of the contract.
</p>
<p>8.3  Life Cycle Asset Management Plan
</p>
<p>A life cycle asset management plan is a plan formed by identifying the operating 
</p>
<p>regime of the asset, the associated maintenance, repair and overhaul activities, the 
</p>
<p>planned life, and the disposal plan of the item. Life cycle costing involves creat-
</p>
<p>ing a life cycle asset management plan. In fact the plan and the costing occur 
</p>
<p>together, and the need for the plan is the second reason for carrying out life cycle 
</p>
<p>costing.
</p>
<p>8.3.1  Why Do We Need a Life Cycle Asset  
</p>
<p>Management Plan?
</p>
<p>We need a life cycle asset management plan as a basis for planning resources and 
</p>
<p>budgets for support of the asset.
</p>
<p>The life cycle asset management plan can be broad brush at the preacquisition 
</p>
<p>stage but will then be refined at the feasibility analysis stage and again when the 
</p>
<p>asset is in service.
</p>
<p>8.3.2  Sources of Information
</p>
<p>Maintenance requirements will include routine maintenance and an estimate of 
</p>
<p>nonroutine maintenance requirements. Logistic support analysis, carried out as 
</p>
<p>part of the feasibility phases of the development will provide an input into the Life 
</p>
<p>Cycle Asset Management Plan.
</p>
<p>Basic information relating to the maintenance regime will normally be sup-
</p>
<p>plied by the equipment manufacturer. However, this may need adjustment depend-
</p>
<p>ing on the planned level of activity and the operating environment. If operating 
</p>
<p>rates, for example, are significantly higher than normal or environmental condi-
</p>
<p>tion significantly more severe, then the life cycle asset management plan and costs 
</p>
<p>must take this into account. The plan must also take account of the relevant regula-
</p>
<p>tory regimes. If the equipment or the application is nonstandard then an analysis 
</p>
<p>technique such as Reliability Centered Maintenance can be used to determine an 
</p>
<p>appropriate maintenance policy.

</p>
<p>8.4  Replacement Decisions
</p>
<p>The third reason for life cycle costing relates to replacement decisions. As assets 
</p>
<p>age, we need to consider replacing them. The replacement decision is based on com-
</p>
<p>paring the annual cost of maintaining the existing asset with the equivalent annual 
</p>
<p>cost of the new asset. Replacement should occur once the annual maintenance cost 
</p>
<p>of the old item exceeds the equivalent annual cost of the new item, calculated over 
</p>
<p>its life cycle. Thus the life cycle cost of the new item is a significant consideration in 
</p>
<p>the replacement decision. In a later chapter, we shall consider replacement decision 
</p>
<p>analysis in more detail and bring a range of factors into the discussion.

</p>
<p>8.6  Life Cycle Costing Example
</p>
<p>In Life Cycle Costing the costs associated with acquisition, operation, and through 
</p>
<p>life support are brought together in a spreadsheet or in a similar purpose built sys-
</p>
<p>tem, and the total costs across the life cycle are calculated. To build the spread-
</p>
<p>sheet we need to establish the life cycle asset management plan, which involves 
</p>
<p>determining the operation, maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities which will 
</p>
<p>be required over the life cycle. Thus, although the emphasis in the techniques is on 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;costing,&rdquo; we see that the life cycle asset management plan must be created before 
</p>
<p>the costs can be estimated.
</p>
<p>As the life cycle extends over a period of years, discounted cash flow tech-
</p>
<p>niques are used to calculate Net Present Value and the Equivalent Annual Cost. 
</p>
<p>Figure 8.2 shows an example of the life cost analysis for a Circuit Breaker Bay in 
</p>
<p>an electricity transmission system. The details are simplified to show the princi-
</p>
<p>ples involved, and no operating costs are shown as they are not a significant issue 
</p>
<p>in this case. The Bay has a 30-year life, with the first 16 years being shown in 
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.2.
</p>
<p>The year labeled &minus;1 is the year prior to acquisition, when initial engineering anal-
</p>
<p>ysis, acquisition project work, and vendor selection are carried out. Year zero is the 
</p>
<p>year of acquisition. Life cycle cost elements include the planning and management 
</p>
<p>of the installation; the building of roads, paths, and ducts; the acquisition of the main 
</p>
<p>switchgear and of the other items shown under the &ldquo;year zero&rdquo; heading in column A.
</p>
<p>The life cycle asset management plan is formed by deciding&mdash;on an initial 
</p>
<p>planning basis&mdash;the operating life, maintenance, overhaul, and disposal plans. 
</p>
<p>These are then costed and linked to the life cycle time frame.
</p>
<p>In the example the life cycle asset management plan involves:
</p>
<p>&bull; A planned life of 30 years
</p>
<p>&bull; Annual maintenance at a cost of $3,000 per year
</p>
<p>&bull; 3 year cyclic maintenance at a cost of $6,000 per event
</p>
<p>&bull; Midlife upgrade at a cost of $250,000
</p>
<p>&bull; Disposal after 30 years at a cost of $48,000
</p>
<p>In Fig. 8.2, the annual maintenance costs are shown in row 15, the 3-year cyclic 
</p>
<p>costs are in row 16, and the midlife upgrade is in row 17, specifically at cell R17. 
</p>
<p>The disposal cost of $48,000 is incurred in year 30, which is not shown in the fig-
</p>
<p>ure, as this only shows years up to 16.
</p>
<p>Life cycle costs are then calculated, specifically the net present value and the 
</p>
<p>equivalent annual cost. Inflation is allowed for by expressing costs in year zero 
</p>
<p>values and using the real rate of interest, which is estimated at 4 % and shown at 
</p>
<p>cell C2. The Net Present Value of costs is $1,619,000, shown at cell C20 and the 
</p>
<p>Equivalent Annual Cost is $94,000 shown at cell C21.
</p>
<p>The costs then form the basis for budgeting for acquisition and sustainment and 
</p>
<p>the life cycle asset management plan forms a basis for maintenance and logistic 
</p>
<p>resource provisioning.

<p>8.7  Input to Plans and Budgets
</p>
<p>The life cycle plan and costs have several uses as follows:
</p>
<p>8.7.1  Acquisition
</p>
<p>In developing a business case for an acquisition project the results of Life Cycle 
</p>
<p>Planning and Costing feed into the project proposal.
</p>
<p>8.7.2  Support Facilities and Logistics Planning
</p>
<p>Life Cycle Asset Management Plans form building blocks for identifying the 
</p>
<p>requirements for support facilities and logistics. This leads to decisions regarding 
</p>
<p>level of repair and outsourcing. These features are illustrated in Fig. 8.3.
</p>
<p>8.7.3  In-Service Asset Management Planning and Budgeting
</p>
<p>Life cycle asset management plans for individual assets or groups of similar assets 
</p>
<p>form building blocks from which plans and budgets are generated for in-service 
</p>
<p>assets. Time-based plans (e.g., a one year or 5-year asset management plans and 
</p>
<p>budgets) are formed by consolidating the asset and support facility requirements 
</p>
<p>across the whole asset portfolio.
</p>
<p>To do this we need to know the repair, maintenance, overhaul, and replacement 
</p>
<p>plan for the individual assets or groups of similar assets so that we can develop an 
</p>
<p>aggregated plan for the asset portfolio as a whole. The planning will take account 
</p>
<p>of the current age and condition of the assets, using the original life cycle plan and 
</p>
<p>costings as a starting point.
</p>
<p>Costings for individual assets feed into the organization&rsquo;s budget for the follow-
</p>
<p>ing year and for longer planning periods such as a 5-year asset management plan. 
</p>
<p>The process is illustrated in Fig. 11.4.

<p>Familiarity breeds
</p>
<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to draw attention to the need for asset  
</p>
<p>managers to be familiar with their assets in a technical, business, and opera-
</p>
<p>tional context. The role of the asset manager involves being well informed across 
</p>
<p>the application of the assets, although this does not mean that the asset manager 
</p>
<p>will be the ultimate expert on any one functional aspect. The asset manager will 
</p>
<p>have an integrated view of the assets as a whole and will understand the relation-
</p>
<p>ships, interdependence, and degree of criticality among the deployed assets and be 
</p>
<p>aware of asset condition. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will be aware 
</p>
<p>of the importance of understanding the range of assets which are used in the busi-
</p>
<p>ness, their roles, the technologies involved, and the relative criticality of particular 
</p>
<p>assets. You will be aware of the value of expert teams which have in-depth asset 
</p>
<p>knowledge of particular asset types. You will be aware of the significance of bot-
</p>
<p>tlenecks that can occur particularly in flow process businesses and of possible 
</p>
<p>backlogs of work and of asset condition. These are factors which may require an 
</p>
<p>adjustment of resources.
</p>
<p>9.1  Awareness of Key Assets1
</p>
<p>Successful asset management is dependent on managers having a clear under-
</p>
<p>standing of the assets that are required to physically sustain the business and to 
</p>
<p>keep it profitable. There is value in having a register of key assets of the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion which includes information on their leading specifications and age. Having a 
</p>
<p>high standard of awareness of the key assets promotes good asset management. In 
</p>
<p>particular, it focuses the attention of employees at all levels on the role and sig-
</p>
<p>nificance of the assets on which the organization depends. It is also valuable to 
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55001 Clause 4.3: &ldquo;The organization shall determine the boundaries of the asset manage-
ment system&hellip;&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>promote an awareness of the range of assets and their interrelationship in provid-
</p>
<p>ing essential capabilities.
</p>
<p>Key aspects of asset knowledge can be summarized as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Awareness of key assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Block diagrams of major product flows, systems, etc.
</p>
<p>&bull; Criticality of assets from technical and business viewpoints
</p>
<p>&bull; Awareness of expert individuals or teams who have fully detailed knowledge of 
</p>
<p>particular asset types
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset utilization
</p>
<p>&bull; Bottlenecks
</p>
<p>&bull; Backlogs
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset condition
</p>
<p>Asset management information systems contain a vast amount of detailed 
</p>
<p>information. In order to see the wood for the trees, the register of key assets, 
</p>
<p>which is essentially a report generated from the full asset register, lists the main 
</p>
<p>items at a senior management decision level. The register of key assets is a 
</p>
<p>useful document in capability development planning and capital budgeting. This 
</p>
<p>document will incorporate information such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset/capability title
</p>
<p>&bull; Brief configuration detail
</p>
<p>&bull; Location
</p>
<p>&bull; Age
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset condition
</p>
<p>&bull; Estimated remaining life
</p>
<p>&bull; Book value
</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement cost
</p>
<p>&bull; Recent history, e.g., last overhaul or upgrade date
</p>
<p>&bull; Known issues
</p>
<p>&bull; Known plans
</p>
<p>There is also value in having maps, plans, satellite images, photographs, and 
</p>
<p>surveillance images at various levels of detail, making it as simple as possible to 
</p>
<p>understand the location and nature of assets and their current condition.
</p>
<p>9.1.1  Examples
</p>
<p>An indication of the range and complexity of industrial assets is given by Fig. 9.1, 
</p>
<p>which shows the assets at a mine site. The actual mining operation is not in the pic-
</p>
<p>ture, and requires a further range of assets in the form of mining machinery and sup-
</p>
<p>porting services. Most industrial complexes involve a wide range of types of assets.
</p>
<p>A statement of the quantity of assets under management, of the budget involved 
</p>
<p>and of the work carried out annually is valuable as an indicator to staff, to </p>

</p>
<p>senior management, and to the public of the scale of the asset management task. 
</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 gives an example.
</p>
<p>At an electricity transmission company the CEO arranged for video screens 
</p>
<p>in the head office to display, on a real-time basis, the electricity throughput of 
</p>
<p>each of the company&rsquo;s major transmission lines. This drew the attention to the 
</p>
<p>fact that the important action was happening out there in the field, and that the 
</p>
<p>activities of the office staff were essentially in support of the physical transmis-
</p>
<p>sion process.

</p>
<p>9.2  Acquisition of Asset Knowledge
</p>
<p>The acquisition of asset knowledge requires a formal effort. Asset managers 
</p>
<p>should always take the trouble to learn about the assets under their jurisdiction. A 
</p>
<p>good approach to this is to assign young engineers the task of documenting areas 
</p>
<p>of plant and explaining their workings in a descriptive document. Staff generally 
</p>

<p>9.3  Block Diagrams
</p>
<p>System block diagrams help in understanding the role and criticality of assets. A 
</p>
<p>very simplified block diagram based on a power station is shown in Fig. 9.3.
</p>
<p>The following are some rules for creating block diagrams:
</p>
<p>1. The function of each component or block should be identified.
</p>
<p>2. Each block should be physically identifiable.
</p>
<p>3. The blocks should be mutually independent (as far as reasonably possible).
</p>
<p>4. Links, e.g., pipes, wiring, couplings should be assigned to specific blocks, or 
</p>
<p>form their own block where justified.
</p>
<p>5. Each block should preferably focus on one main technology, e.g., mechanical, 
</p>
<p>electrical, hydraulic, PLC.
</p>
<p>9.3.1  Information Required Per Block
</p>
<p>The following points give an indication of the type of information required in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to each block:
</p>
<p>&bull; Function of block and basic operating principles
</p>
<p>&bull; Inputs
</p>
<p>&bull; Outputs

<p>&ndash; Other gauge settings.
</p>
<p>9.3.2  Drawings
</p>
<p>To fully understand the detail of a system it may be necessary to study the engi-
</p>
<p>neering drawings or piping and instrumentation diagram. This can be a worthwhile 
</p>
<p>exercise. As my father used to say (probably quoting the Duke of Wellington), 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;time spent in reconnaissance is seldom wasted.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>9.4  Criticality
</p>
<p>For asset planning we need to understand the criticality of the various items. 
</p>
<p>This will be in terms of potential production losses if they fail, and also 
</p>
<p>reflect safety and environmental issues. Criticality analysis helps us to prior-
</p>
<p>itize maintenance work and also provides a basis for designing-in redundancy 
</p>
<p>and making contingency plans. There are many examples where the loss of a 
</p>
<p>production unit has caused major disruption on a statewide basis, such as the 
</p>
<p>Varanus Island gas terminal in Western Australia, where a failure cut off one-
</p>
<p>third of the state&rsquo;s gas supply. A similar example is the Longford gas plant in 
</p>
<p>Victoria where a failure cut off the gas supply to Melbourne for several weeks. 
</p>
<p>In the aftermath to this latter event, other sources of gas supply were expanded 
</p>
<p>so that risk was reduced.
</p>
<p>9.4.1  Example&mdash;Chemical Plant
</p>
<p>In the example in Fig. 9.4 which is from a chemical plant, the heat exchangers 
</p>
<p>were identified as the most critical assets as they are not duplicated and can only 
</p>
<p>be repaired off-line, a time-consuming process involving extensive delays for 
</p>
<p>cooling and start-up. To offset the criticality we need to prioritize these items and 
</p>
<p>ensure that they meet fitness-for-service criteria at a standard sufficient to sustain 
</p>
<p>them over a defined planning and inter-inspection period.

<p>9.5  Expert Teams
</p>
<p>An expert team is a group of people with specialized knowledge of the working of a 
</p>
<p>particular functional area or of a particular type of plant. Figure 9.6 shows an example 
</p>
<p>of the type of membership of a team. The technical nature of the equipment and the 
</p>
<p>processes makes it essential to have people who understand the plant in order to make 
</p>
<p>sound decisions. Forming expert teams give plant personnel status and motivation. They 
</p>
<p>take their expertise seriously and it is taken seriously by management.
</p>
<p>In some cases the expert team may be formed by linking experts across sites. 
</p>
<p>For example, a mining company may have an expert team with knowledge of a 
</p>
<p>particular type of process or machine, such as draglines. Technical problems relat-
</p>
<p>ing to draglines, such as root cause analysis of failures, would draw on the knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of this group.
</p>
<p>However, it is important to keep focussed on the objectives of the organization 
</p>
<p>and not get side tracked into displacement activities.
</p>
<p>9.6  Bottlenecks
</p>
<p>A bottleneck is a part of a process which has limited capacity, and therefore con-
</p>
<p>strains the throughput of the system as a whole. In systems involving simple flow 
</p>
<p>processes, effective improvements can only occur at bottlenecks. However, bot-
</p>
<p>tlenecks are not always constant, but may depend on the production or product 
</p>
<p>mix. For example, in a production facility, we received a large order for product 
</p>
<p>requiring heat treatment. This made our heat treatment plant into a bottleneck at 
</p>
<p>that time, whereas with a normal mix of orders, we had plenty of heat treatment 
</p>
<p>capacity. We should therefore consider how demand on machines varies with the 
</p>
<p>product mix before focusing on a current bottleneck. Also, if we act to remove

</p>
<p>an existing bottleneck, the effect may be limited by causing a new bottleneck to 
</p>
<p>appear in a different part of the process.
</p>
<p>De-bottlenecking involves making investments that are cost-effective in 
</p>
<p>increasing product flow or reducing costs by relieving bottlenecks. As part of 
</p>
<p>our asset knowledge we should be aware of existing and potential bottlenecks, if 
</p>
<p>any, and seek to relieve bottlenecks where this can provide the most cost-effective 
</p>
<p>improvements. The following steps are recommended for this purpose:
</p>
<p>1. Flowchart the process, identifying operations, queues, storages.
</p>
<p>2. Identify demand drivers (e.g., customer pull), demand rates, and translate into 
</p>
<p>average required throughput rates for each part of the process. Take account of 
</p>
<p>average and peak loads.
</p>
<p>3. Identify capacity constraint areas&mdash;potential bottlenecks.
</p>
<p>4. Calculate maximum throughput rate of areas, using averages, then allow 25 % 
</p>
<p>extra for queueing effects. Take maintenance into account.
</p>
<p>5. Recognize areas as (a) complete bottlenecks, (b) occasional bottlenecks, (c) 
</p>
<p>excess capacity.
</p>
<p>6. Consider variability in service times. A high degree of variability (as opposed to 
</p>
<p>consistent, even performance) leads to longer queues and/or larger stockpiles.
</p>
<p>7. Treat bottlenecks by adjusting capacity, reducing variability, or prioritizing flows.
</p>
<p>9.7  Backlogs
</p>
<p>The buildup of backlogs of work in particular areas is relatively easy to iden-
</p>
<p>tify, but is often ignored by management. Backlogs are an indicator of lack 
</p>
<p>of resources in particular areas, whereas lack of a backlog indicates adequate 
</p>
<p>resources. Watch out in case there is some deliberate attempt to distort the picture. 
</p>
<p>Management should respond to the buildup of backlogs by checking the reason 
</p>
<p>and taking steps to reduce the backlog, or to contain it to reasonable levels.
</p>
<p>9.8  Asset Condition2
</p>
<p>Asset condition will usually deteriorate over useful life. Normal depreciation 
</p>
<p>reflects this loss of condition in a general sense. If the condition of an asset is such 
</p>
<p>that it can no longer serve its functional purpose, then corrective action should be 
</p>
<p>taken to restore the functionality. Considerations are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset condition in regard to primary functionality and safety.

<div class="annotation"><a href="http://www.ingenium.org.nz">http://www.ingenium.org.nz</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>169
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset condition in regard to expected level of service, particularly for those 
</p>
<p>which deteriorate gradually and where the condition can then be restored, such 
</p>
<p>as roads and buildings.
</p>
<p>An approach is to assess condition on a specified scale. This may be a 1&ndash;5 scale 
</p>
<p>such as:
</p>
<p>1 = very good
</p>
<p>2 = good
</p>
<p>3 = moderate
</p>
<p>4 = poor
</p>
<p>5 = very poor.
</p>
<p>For comparison purposes it is important to have agreed systems for assessing asset 
</p>
<p>condition.
</p>
<p>The response to deteriorating asset condition can involve a timescale over 
</p>
<p>which corrective action needs to be taken, such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Immediate,
</p>
<p>&bull; Within 1 month,
</p>
<p>&bull; Within 3 months,
</p>
<p>&bull; Within 1 year,
</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor at next inspection.
</p>
<p>For any given equipment type, the details can be spelled out in an inspection or 
</p>
<p>condition monitoring procedure. The key point is to be aware of asset condition 
</p>
<p>and to respond in time to sustain the functionality and safety.
</p>
<p>9.9  Plant Criticality Exercise
</p>
<p>The senior management of a process plant wants to increase production. They are 
</p>
<p>considering adding another product line and have a cost estimate of $750,000. You 
</p>
<p>are a plant engineer and are asked to comment on the proposal. You know that the 
</p>
<p>standard of reliability of the equipment is not high and that down time is signifi-
</p>
<p>cant, particularly for the furnace and blower.
</p>
<p>The plant produces intermediate plastic products. Raw material is fed from any 
</p>
<p>of three hoppers into either of two feeder lines. The feeder lines pump material via 
</p>
<p>a flow controller, through a furnace, and then into a blower where it is formed into 
</p>
<p>continuous sheet. There is a pump for each feeder line. From the blower, the mate-
</p>
<p>rial can be fed to any of five existing product lines. Give answers in dot point form 
</p>
<p>to the following questions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Draw a block diagram of the process.
</p>
<p>&bull; Which stages of the process are critical from an operational point of view?
</p>
<p>&bull; What do you suggest to management?
</p>
<p>&bull; How would you back up your recommendations?

</p>
<p>Okay, &ldquo;said Jock,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll own up to it. It was in my early days out of college. I 
</p>
<p>was in charge of a repair workshop, way up-country. Most of the focus of my life 
</p>
<p>at the time was on sport and running a dance band and all I really took note of in 
</p>
<p>the workshop was keeping up the stocks for the vending machines. There was a 
</p>
<p>heap of complaints if they ran out of anything.
</p>
<p>It was a couple of years later, after I had moved on, that I realized some of the 
</p>
<p>things that I should have been doing and looked back in embarrassment.
</p>
<p>There was a bottleneck in our production&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure now that people were try-
</p>
<p>ing to tell me about it at the time. It was in textile work&mdash;not a big technical focus 
</p>
<p>but there was a lot of it. We only had one textile worker and she was always flat 
</p>
<p>out and holding things up. I could have easily recruited another textile worker 
</p>
<p>when one of the staff from another area left, but my mind just wasn&rsquo;t into gear on 
</p>
<p>that sort of thing. It&rsquo;s definitely not covered in an engineering degree.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem such a big deal,&rdquo; said Veronica.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, but I still feel stupid about it,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about ways of getting it wrong,&rdquo; said Veronica sometime 
</p>
<p>later.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;like what?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first you can have a senior management that is completely out of touch.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite common,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was reading about the high priests of the Incas sacrificing virgins to stop the 
</p>
<p>advance of the Spanish conquistadores,&rdquo; said Veronica.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good example, but be careful, the Incas might sue you for defama-
</p>
<p>tion,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is not reacting to known issues, like ignoring obvious worn out 
</p>
<p>stuff. And then just not being aware if issues that you&mdash;or someone&mdash;should be 
</p>
<p>aware of, such fatigue failure or insulation degradation,&rdquo; said Veronica.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s just bad luck,&rdquo; said Jock
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Veronica. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll buy a Lotto ticket.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe how to plan for the provision of 
</p>
<p>assets which are required to meet an ongoing need. This is a very common situa-
</p>
<p>tion, in which demand for a type of asset continues into the future, but older items 
</p>
<p>require replacement and variations occur, due to the changes in demand levels and 
</p>
<p>to market  and technical developments. Outcomes After reading this chapter you 
</p>
<p>will have learnt how to plan the purchase of items to sustain an ongoing capability 
</p>
<p>requirement, by calculating the preplan capability gap and then working toward  
</p>
<p>the planning horizon calculating the purchase needs year by year and making 
</p>
<p>suitable purchase decisions. You will become familiar with a spreadsheet-based 
</p>
<p>method for carrying out the necessary calculations and for graphically illustrating 
</p>
<p>the gap analysis and the acquisition costs.
</p>
<p>10.1  Asset Continuity
</p>
<p>Asset continuity refers to the common situation where the requirement for the 
</p>
<p>services delivered by a given type of asset is ongoing. Most asset management 
</p>
<p>situations involve planning for the continuity of an existing system of assets, the 
</p>
<p>role of which will continue on into the future. Each asset will have its own life 
</p>
<p>cycle, but the overall situation is more complex than might be suggested by a 
</p>
<p>focus on the life cycles of individual assets or of particular asset types alone. The 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;inputs to capability&rdquo; of ranges of major asset types frequently overlap, as do the 
</p>
<p>requirements for supporting asset systems and facilities.
</p>
<p>An example is a trucking business, where continuity is required in meeting the 
</p>
<p>demands of the business, so that disposal of old trucks at the end of their useful 
</p>
<p>life is matched by acquisition of new trucks, with variations as necessary to reflect 
</p>
<p>business and technical developments. At the same time, the support facilities such 
</p>
<p>as maintenance personnel and facilities, and asset information systems, will need 
</p>
<p>to continue, but also with developments as necessary to follow the changes in the 
</p>
<p>assets themselves and in the related technology.

<p>To maintain continuity in an asset fleet it is necessary to make financial provision 
</p>
<p>for the purchase of new items as the fleet ages. If the fleet has an even spread of 
</p>
<p>ages, disposals and acquisitions can occur at roughly even rates to keep the fleet 
</p>
<p>size in balance. It is more likely, however, that most of the items in a fleet will 
</p>
<p>have similar ages, and in this case we must make financial provision against the 
</p>
<p>time when many replacements are due. The numbers purchased at any one time 
</p>
<p>may involve considerations of available capital and economies of scale.
</p>
<p>Ideally, we would like to know how much longer individual items will last before we 
</p>
<p>need to replace them. But at the overall budgeting stage we need a process which will 
</p>
<p>ensure that we have, at an aggregate level, the funding to provide the equipment that we 
</p>
<p>need when we need it. In practice, we will take into account individual asset condition 
</p>
<p>and service requirements when making a specific replacement decision.
</p>
<p>10.1.1.2  Uniformity
</p>
<p>There are advantages in having uniform fleets, so that we may wish to retire a par-
</p>
<p>ticular equipment type all together and bring in the replacement type. This sim-
</p>
<p>plifies issues such as operations, training, spare parts provision, and technical 
</p>
<p>support. We may also wish to use preferred suppliers so as to avoid too wide a 
</p>
<p>spread of types for logistic support.
</p>
<p>10.2  Asset Data
</p>
<p>For planning purposes, data will be required. This will be held in an Asset Register 
</p>
<p>and will be along the following lines:
</p>
<p>&bull; The types of assets in the fleet;
</p>
<p>&bull; The quantity of each type;
</p>
<p>&bull; Date of acquisition of each asset.
</p>
<p>Also, we need an estimate of the useful life of each asset type. Ideally, this will be 
</p>
<p>contained in the life cycle asset management plan for the asset. We may also take 
</p>
<p>account of utilization data such as service hours of operation, or kilometers run in 
</p>
<p>the case of vehicles.
</p>
<p>10.3  Planning Terminology
</p>
<p>The following terms are useful in the planning process. These are illustrated in 
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.1.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>175
</p>
<p>&bull; Year of Acquisition is the year when the asset is acquired, usually also assumed 
</p>
<p>to be the year when it starts its operational life. This should be recorded in the 
</p>
<p>asset database.
</p>
<p>&bull; Age or Year of Life Measures of the age of an asset. Year of life is the age +1. 
</p>
<p>Thus the first year of life is year 1, the second year is year 2, and so on.
</p>
<p> For some assets, cumulative utilization may be a more effective measure than 
</p>
<p>calendar time.
</p>
<p>&bull; Life of Type is the number of years for which a given type of item is assumed to 
</p>
<p>last, for planning purposes. An alternative term is Estimated Useful Life. This 
</p>
<p>concept is useful in planning for fleets of similar assets. For major assets, we 
</p>
<p>may base our planning on individually assessed remaining lives. The Life of 
</p>
<p>Type may vary with the application and with the environment. For asset fleets, 
</p>
<p>it is advisable to assign a Life of Type for each type of asset. A guideline is 
</p>
<p>given by the depreciation schedules published by tax authorities. This lists 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;effective lives&rdquo; for a whole range of asset types. Decisions on specific item 
</p>
<p>replacement can be made tactically in the short term, but it is unwise to rely on 
</p>
<p>a purely tactical approach, as this may not give an adequate signal of financial 
</p>
<p>requirements.
</p>
<p>&bull; Remaining Life is the number of years which we expect an asset to last from now.
</p>
<p> For major items the remaining life may be assessed individually.
</p>
<p>&bull; Year of Expiry is the calendar year in which an asset runs out of planned life. 
</p>
<p>This is normally when it reaches its Life of Type.
</p>
<p> Or we may estimate the Year of Expiry from the Remaining Life and the current 
</p>
<p>year. It is the current year plus the Remaining Life.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition Lead Time The time taken to plan and give effect to the acquisition 
</p>
<p>of an item and bring it into service.
</p>
<p>Year of Life = Current year &minus; Year of Acquisition + 1
</p>
<p>Remaining Life = Life of Type &minus; Year of Life
</p>
<p>Year of Expiry = Current year + Life of Type &minus; Year of Life
</p>
<p>Year of Expiry = Current year + Remaining Life.

</p>
<p>&bull; Year of Decision The calendar year when an acquisition must be approved in 
</p>
<p>order to make an item available when it is needed.
</p>
<p>10.4  Planning Schedules
</p>
<p>In practice, asset continuity planning will involve many types of assets with vary-
</p>
<p>ing ages and conditions. Planning schedules, usually in a spreadsheet format, can 
</p>
<p>be used to assist in asset planning process. Useful schedules are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Expiry Schedule This shows how many items of a given range of assets are 
</p>
<p>expected to reach their Year of Expiry by nominated calendar years.
</p>
<p>&bull; Retirement Schedule This is a schedule of planned retirement dates, which 
</p>
<p>reflects decisions whereby some items retire at dates which differ from the 
</p>
<p>expiry schedule. We should not lightly run over the Year of Expiry, but varia-
</p>
<p>tions in timing may occur for reasons of cost and operational factors. If every 
</p>
<p>item retired at its expiry date, the expiry and retirement schedules would be the 
</p>
<p>same.
</p>
<p>&bull; Decision Schedule shows the types and numbers of items on which replacement 
</p>
<p>decisions are needed in each year.
</p>
<p>&bull;  Acquisition and Cost Schedule is derived from the preceding schedules.
</p>
<p>10.5  Planning Schedules Example
</p>
<p>The spreadsheet shown in Fig. 10.2 in an Excel format relates to an electricity 
</p>
<p>distribution company. The company has a number of transformers of various 
</p>
<p>types. It is planning a capital budget for transformer replacement. The types of 
</p>
<p>transformers are designated H, K, and M in column A. Different numbers of 
</p>
<p>transformers were purchased in different years in the past.
</p>
<p>Year of Decision = Year of Expiry &minus; Acquisition Lead Time.

</p>
<p>10.5.1  Expiry Schedule
</p>
<p>Figure 10.2 shows the expiry schedule for various cohorts of transformers. For 
</p>
<p>example Row 2, Column E, shows that 10 transformers of type H will reach their 
</p>
<p>expiry date in year 3 (i.e. 3 years from now). Similar entries are shown for the 
</p>
<p>various cohorts of transformers.
</p>
<p>10.5.2  Acquisition and Cost Schedule
</p>
<p>The expiry schedule of Fig. 10.2 forms a basis for planning a replacement sched-
</p>
<p>ule in which some adjustment of the replacement pattern may take place in order to 
</p>
<p>smooth both the replacement workload and the capital requirements. The smooth-
</p>
<p>ing process assumes that there will be some latitude for varying the expiry schedule 
</p>
<p>based on asset condition. Technical knowledge of asset condition will be required to 
</p>
<p>confirm whether this is practical. The replacement schedule is not shown separately, 
</p>
<p>but is incorporated into the acquisition and cost schedule shown in Fig. 10.3.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 10.3, Row 1 shows the years ahead, which normally would be shown as 
</p>
<p>calendar years. The &ldquo;Qty&rdquo; column for each year shows the number of transformers of 
</p>
<p>a given type which are budgeted for replacement in that year. The replacement quanti-
</p>
<p>ties were initially derived from an expiry schedule, but the results have been smoothed 
</p>
<p>during the planning process, so that, for example, the plan is to replace 11 type H 
</p>
<p>transformers in each of years 3 and 4, rather than 10 in year 3 and 12 in year 5.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cost&rdquo; column shows the corresponding capital cost for replacement. For 
</p>
<p>example, cell J3 shows a cost of $8,250,000 to be budgeted for replacement of 11 
</p>
<p>type H transformers in Year 3. The final result from the acquisition and cost sched-
</p>
<p>ule will feed into the overall Capital Expenditure Budget.
</p>
<p>10.5.3  Application of the Acquisition and Cost Schedule
</p>
<p>The resulting acquisition and cost schedule forms a basis for budgeting and acqui-
</p>
<p>sition planning. The actual numbers of replacements may in practice vary from

</p>
<p>those planned, but if estimates have been based on sound experience and judge-
</p>
<p>ment, the overall numbers of replacements will be approximately correct. The 
</p>
<p>result will be effective management of the assets, which might otherwise have 
</p>
<p>been allowed to run to failure with resulting loss of system reliability and safety.
</p>
<p>10.6  Planning Example with Varying Needs
</p>
<p>In the previous example, replacements were planned on a one-for-one basis, but 
</p>
<p>in practice there may be variations as changes in capacity requirements result in 
</p>
<p>the population being increased or decreased through time. The following example 
</p>
<p>illustrates this.
</p>
<p>A transportation company maintains a vehicle fleet.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.4 shows data relating to a particular range of vehicles, for which the 
</p>
<p>unit acquisition cost is $800,000 and the unit disposal cost is $100,000. These 
</p>
<p>unit costs are shown in Row 2. The number of units needed in-service over the 
</p>
<p>next 6 years is shown as &ldquo;In-Service Need&rdquo; in Row 4. This number includes a 
</p>
<p>provision for local contingency holdings to cover emergencies. Initially there are 
</p>
<p>108 vehicles in-service including contingency, and 10 vehicles acquired but not 
</p>
<p>currently deployed, giving a total of 118, shown as the year 1 &ldquo;Un-augmented 
</p>
<p>qty&rdquo; at cell B6. Senior management has stated that the number of non-deployed 
</p>
<p>vehicles is to be reduced.
</p>
<p>The number of disposals of vehicles over the planning period has been estimated, 
</p>
<p>allowing for aging and condition of the existing items. This is shown in Row 5 as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disposals end of year&rdquo;. The problem is to plan the purchase of new vehicles over 
</p>
<p>the 7-year planning period and to estimate the financial capital requirements.
</p>
<p>10.6.1  Preplan Gap Analysis
</p>
<p>The first step is to carry out a preplan gap analysis. A preplan gap analysis is an 
</p>
<p>analysis of the situation before we plan any acquisitions or other changes. It rep-
</p>
<p>resents how the situation would unfold if we do nothing. In the example, the gap

</p>
<p>between the in-service need and the quantity available after disposals is the pre-
</p>
<p>plan gap this represents the situation before we plan any acquisitions.
</p>
<p>The calculations are shown in Fig. 10.5. We first calculate the un-augmented 
</p>
<p>capacity by subtracting the disposals (Row 5) progressively from the initial 
</p>
<p>quantity available (cell B6).
</p>
<p>Figure 10.5 Row 6 shows the result. We then calculate the preplan gap by 
</p>
<p>subtracting the un-augmented capacity (Row 6) from the need (Row 4). Row 7 
</p>
<p>shows the result.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.6 shows the preplan gap as a graph, based on the needs (Row 4) and 
</p>
<p>the un-augmented qty available (Row 6). The space between the two lines is the 
</p>
<p>gap, and can be negative (representing a surplus) or positive (representing a short-
</p>
<p>age). The preplan gap result can assist with acquisition planning. In the example, 
</p>
<p>the minimum total number of vehicles to be acquired over the planning horizon is 
</p>
<p>46, given in cell H7 of Fig. 10.5. This result can assist us in deciding on an acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion strategy, for example, we may decide to develop a purchase plan covering all 46 
</p>
<p>vehicles, from our preferred potential suppliers. We also see that there will not be a 
</p>
<p>positive gap until year 3, and this tells us that we have some lead time in hand.

</p>
<p>10.6.2  Creating the Purchase Plan
</p>
<p>The process for creating the purchase plan for each year across the horizon is as 
</p>
<p>follows. The process is illustrated in Fig. 10.7 and summarized algebraically at the 
</p>
<p>end of this section.
</p>
<p>a. Calculate the quantity-before-purchase, that is, the fleet quantity available in 
</p>
<p>the current year before more items are purchased (Row 9 and Eq. 8.3);
</p>
<p>b. Calculate the gap-before-purchase, this gives the minimum number to be pur-
</p>
<p>chased to cover the gap (Row 10 and Eq. 8.4);
</p>
<p>c. Create a purchase plan quantity (Row 11, BOY = Beginning of Year) which 
</p>
<p>may vary from the minimum purchases;
</p>
<p>d. Calculate the fleet quantity-after-purchase, (Row 12 and Eq. 8.5);
</p>
<p>e. Calculate the cost (Row 17).
</p>
<p>10.6.2.1  Planning Steps
</p>
<p>The steps in the example are as follows: For year 1 we calculate the quantity-
</p>
<p>before-purchase and the gap-before-purchase. In year 1, the gap-before-purchase 
</p>
<p>is negative so we decide to make no purchases. In year 2, the gap is also negative 
</p>
<p>so again we make no purchases. In year 3, the quantity-before purchase, is 104 
</p>
<p>but the In-Service Need is 110, so we get a gap-before-purchase of 6. These vehi-
</p>
<p>cles are normally purchased in multiple quantities of about 10. The reason behind 
</p>
<p>the minimum lot size is that we want to avoid having too fragmented a set of 
</p>
<p>assets and also to achieve economies of scale in purchasing. Since our policy is to

<p>purchase in lots of at least 10, we plan to purchase 10. The quantity-after-purchase 
</p>
<p>then becomes 114, shown at cell D12.
</p>
<p>For year 4, the quantity-before-purchase is found by subtracting the dispos-
</p>
<p>als at the end of year 3, and the gap-before-purchase is calculated. This is 12 
</p>
<p>as shown at cell E10. We then make a purchase plan decision for year 4, and 
</p>
<p>in the example this is for 12 items. The calculations then continue in the same 
</p>
<p>way, with purchase plan decisions being made for each year. As we proceed, 
</p>
<p>the spreadsheet calculates the capital requirement based on the numbers of pur-
</p>
<p>chases and disposals and their costs. A graph of the capital requirements year by 
</p>
<p>year is shown in Fig. 10.8.
</p>
<p>The spreadsheet format allows us to model a range of data assumptions and 
</p>
<p>plans and to present the corresponding tabular and graphical results.
</p>
<p>10.6.2.2  Planning Formulas
</p>
<p>The planning process is summarized algebraically as follows.

<p>And for the purchase planning stage:
</p>
<p>10.7  Capability Continuity Planning
</p>
<p>The process described in this chapter represents a basic approach to the planning 
</p>
<p>of prime equipment requirements and in practice additional work will be required 
</p>
<p>in planning for the continuity of the total capability involved in the sustainment of 
</p>
<p>the assets. Having established the prime asset requirement we continue to plan for 
</p>
<p>the related elements of the capability, and this may cause feedback into the prime 
</p>
<p>equipment plan. In practice, a number of interrelated spreadsheets or similar plan-
</p>
<p>ning systems will be needed.
</p>
<p>10.8  Columnar Format
</p>
<p>The analysis can also be carried out in the style indicated by Fig. 10.9. This lists 
</p>
<p>the assets by type and age, and shows the life of type or estimated useful life of 
</p>
<p>each group. From this the year of expiry, that is, the year by which replacement 
</p>
<p>is needed, can be calculated. In Fig. 10.9 this is shown in relation to &ldquo;Now&rdquo; but in 
</p>
<p>practice an actual calendar year would be shown. The acquisition lead time is then 
</p>

<p>10.9.1  Continuity Planning
</p>
<p>A fleet of five specialized vehicles used in road maintenance was purchased 
</p>
<p>4 years ago. Their Life of Type is 10 years. Because they are imported and then 
</p>
<p>adapted to local conditions, their acquisition lead time is 2 years. Calculate the 
</p>
<p>following:
</p>
<p>a. The year of life of the fleet;
</p>
<p>b. Their remaining life;
</p>
<p>c. Their year of expiry;
</p>
<p>d. Their year of decision;
</p>
<p>e. The capital expenditure plan for continuity of the fleet, given a cost of 
</p>
<p>$700,000 2 years prior to entry into service and $300,000 1 year prior to entry 
</p>
<p>into service.

</p>
<p>New trucks cost $200,000. Old ones are sold for $15,000. The company pol-
</p>
<p>icy is to own sufficient trucks to cover &ldquo;base load&rdquo; requirements. Shortages can 
</p>
<p>be made up by leasing at $50,000 per truck per year. Capital rationing limits pur-
</p>
<p>chases to at most three trucks in any year.

<p>a. Year of Life = Current Year &minus; Year of Acquisition + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.
</p>
<p>b. Remaining Life = Life of Type &minus; Year of Life = 10 &ndash; 5 = 5 years (beyond cur-

</p>
<p>Notes
</p>
<p>a. A rolling plan will be reviewed annually
b. Capital costs are smoother if approximately the same number of vehicles bought each year, but 
this  can have the disadvantage that the fleet is made up of many different models
c. Leasing is usually more expensive than owning in terms of costs per vehicle leased, but&hellip;
d. Leasing costs are an expense which is tax deductible in the current year
e. Leasing gives more flexibility in responding to changes in demand, particularly downturns; 
there is more downside liquidity
f. If demand is up, revenue will be up and the extra cost of leasing will be affordable

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to outline the organization and functions 
</p>
<p>involved in providing for the management of in-service assets over their lifetime, 
</p>
<p>and to describe the formation of asset management plans for in-service assets. 
</p>
<p>Outcomes After reading this chapter you will be aware of the types of activities 
</p>
<p>needed for management of the deployed assets of the organization. This includes 
</p>
<p>the need for having an integrated overview of the deployed assets and of the plan-
</p>
<p>ning needed to provide support and sustainment of the &ldquo;fleet&rdquo; as a whole on a 
</p>
<p>through life basis. You will have seen how asset management plans are developed 
</p>
<p>for an in-service asset fleet as a whole for given planning horizons. You will also 
</p>
<p>be aware of the need for configuration management for the fleet.
</p>
<p>11.1  In-Service Assets
</p>
<p>In-service assets are those currently deployed for use within the organization. 
</p>
<p>In-service assets may be referred to as a &ldquo;fleet,&rdquo; regardless of the type of asset. 
</p>
<p>In this chapter the organization and functions involved in providing for the man-
</p>
<p>agement of in-service assets will be outlined. The development of asset manage-
</p>
<p>ment plans will be considered, leading to the formation of a consolidated asset 
</p>
<p>management plan which forms a basis for budgeting for the fleet.
</p>
<p>11.2  In-Service Support Aims
</p>
<p>In-service asset support involves ensuring that deployed assets are able to deliver 
</p>
<p>their intended function over their required life. The objectives are to achieve busi-
</p>
<p>ness goals for the deployed assets by providing productive capacity, availability, 
</p>
<p>quality, safety, and meeting regulatory standards. Well directed support policies

</p>
<p>and matching levels of expenditure, including maintenance, will enable the assets 
</p>
<p>to effectively support business goals and will also save money by avoiding prema-
</p>
<p>ture replacement and reducing the need for additional equipment.
</p>
<p>The management of in-service support for any particular capability is based on 
</p>
<p>the logistic support planning undertaken at the acquisition stage, but involves inte-
</p>
<p>grating the activities across the range of deployed assets, and dealing with the cur-
</p>
<p>rent circumstances as they evolve over the life of the assets.
</p>
<p>11.3  In-Service Support Activities
</p>
<p>The following activities are required to support the deployed assets.
</p>
<p>Asset continuity planning and management For any particular range of capa-
</p>
<p>bility the asset support manager will maintain information on the asset capability 
</p>
<p>required, the current deployment of assets; surplus or shortages in asset inventory 
</p>
<p>levels; equipment condition; configuration and modification status; logistic sup-
</p>
<p>port status; remaining useful life and requirements and plans for deeper mainte-
</p>
<p>nance and renewal. This information will be used as a basis for decisions relating 
</p>
<p>to equipment deployment, procurement of spares and replacements, and equip-
</p>
<p>ment maintenance policy particularly in regard to overhauls or deeper mainte-
</p>
<p>nance, renewal, and disposals.
</p>
<p>Maintenance This is a basic requirement which is separate from the function 
</p>
<p>of asset management groups. It may come under the overall control of a Chief 
</p>
<p>Asset Manager. Close liaison and regular feedback between asset management and 
</p>
<p>maintenance is important for the effective delivery of asset performance.
</p>
<p>Facilities and resources planning Planning of facilities for maintenance and 
</p>
<p>logistic support across the organization and over the life of the deployed equip-
</p>
<p>ment. This requires a maintenance staffing plan, maintenance training plan; bal-
</p>
<p>ancing of workloads of maintenance staff.
</p>
<p>Asset Information Systems Application, development, and support for the asset 
</p>
<p>management and maintenance applications.
</p>
<p>Spares and consumables management In the acquisition phase there will nor-
</p>
<p>mally be an initial buy of equipment, consumables, spares, and rotables. Once 
</p>
<p>the equipment is in service the continued acquisition of consumables, spares, 
</p>
<p>and rotables becomes part of the in-service asset management function. This 
</p>
<p>includes monitoring and controlling stock levels, including such issues as set-
</p>
<p>ting reorder controls, establishing reserves and repair pools, monitoring procure-
</p>
<p>ment contracts, and creating new contracts as necessary. It will be necessary to 
</p>
<p>keep up-to-date with technical changes and with changes in supplier and support 
</p>
<p>services.
</p>
<p>Regulatory issues awareness and response Awareness of and response to needs 
</p>
<p>relating to regulatory issues such as safety, health, environment, and technical 
</p>
<p>properties of the assets. Statutory requirements for inspections and maintenance 
</p>
<p>activities.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>189
</p>
<p>Risk analysis and risk management
</p>
<p>Technical developments monitoring and response Assessment of the significance 
</p>
<p>of technical developments to operations and asset requirements. Application of 
</p>
<p>technical developments in maintenance, e.g., condition monitoring and proactive 
</p>
<p>asset care rather than a breakdown approach. Care must be taken to ensure that 
</p>
<p>changes are fully substantiated by technically qualified and authorized persons 
</p>
<p>before changes are made.
</p>
<p>Development implementation decisions
</p>
<p>Technical improvements or modifications will come along from time to time. 
</p>
<p>An issue is how any particular change should be implemented. Factors to be con-
</p>
<p>sidered are:
</p>
<p>&bull; If essential for operational, safety or regulatory reasons, prompt implementation 
</p>
<p>will be required.
</p>
<p>&bull; If significantly advantageous but not essential, a phased implementation will be 
</p>
<p>suitable.
</p>
<p>&bull; If only moderately advantageous then the change may be effected as and when 
</p>
<p>it becomes convenient to do so.
</p>
<p>A policy decision categorizing the change and setting out implementation rules 
</p>
<p>will be needed.
</p>
<p>Change Management Whenever changes are implemented, a change manage-
</p>
<p>ment process should be applied, so as to ensure that changes are assessed, man-
</p>
<p>aged, effectively controlled and communicated. The aim is to ensure maximum 
</p>
<p>benefit is achieved from the proposed changes and that there are no adverse effects 
</p>
<p>to health and safety, no damage to plant or equipment, legislative requirements are 
</p>
<p>upheld and negative impacts on performance are avoided.
</p>
<p>Configuration management Maintaining records of the configuration status 
</p>
<p>of in-service equipment. Input into modification decisions, planning upgrades 
</p>
<p>including making equipment available, timing of work and facilities and contract 
</p>
<p>management.
</p>
<p>Deeper maintenance awareness and planning Awareness of the status of equip-
</p>
<p>ment in regard to deeper maintenance needs. Planning for deeper maintenance, 
</p>
<p>for example, planning site shutdowns across the organization, so as to minimize 
</p>
<p>impact on business goals and to be consistent with maintenance resource availabil-
</p>
<p>ity. Arranging deeper maintenance contracts.
</p>
<p>Outsourcing Strategy and contracts for maintenance and related support 
</p>
<p>activities.
</p>
<p>Replacement analysis Reviewing the condition and supportability of equip-
</p>
<p>ment, life cycle cost review and management, input to economic life decisions and 
</p>
<p>to repair/replace strategy.
</p>
<p>Continuous Improvement Continuous Improvement means continually seeking 
</p>
<p>to make improvements in procedures and processes. The accumulation of small 
</p>
<p>improvements can, over time, achieve substantial benefits. Care must be taken to 
</p>

<p>190 11 Management of In-Service Assets
</p>
<p>ensure that changes are fully substantiated by technically qualified and authorized 
</p>
<p>persons before changes are made. Pilot studies and a formal review of possible 
</p>
<p>consequences are recommended before a proposed improvement is adopted.
</p>
<p>Disposal
</p>
<p>Planning and Budgeting for all of the above.
</p>
<p>11.4  Organization for In-Service Support
</p>
<p>The structure required for the organization of in-service asset support is shown in 
</p>
<p>Figs. 2.4 and 11.1 where we see in-service asset support as part of the activity of 
</p>
<p>each asset management group.
</p>
<p>The in-service asset support group manages at the strategic level, the activi-
</p>
<p>ties involved in logistic and technical aspects of deployed assets. The detailed 
</p>
<p>activity of maintenance will be carried out by maintenance departments and 
</p>
<p>workshops which may be part of an operating division or may come directly 
</p>
<p>under the asset management function, or may be outsourced. Engineering, 
</p>
<p>finance, and legal staff work with the in-service support personnel to provide 
</p>
<p>integrated management of the support functions. In a smaller or decentralized 
</p>
<p>organization, in-service asset management may combine with maintenance 
</p>
<p> management roles.
</p>
<p>Staff in the in-service support group will be drawn from experienced maintain-
</p>
<p>ers, experienced operations personnel, technical or engineering support personnel, 
</p>
<p>particularly those familiar with the relevant equipment.

<p>11.5  Engineering and Technical Services
</p>
<p>The role of engineering and technical services is to develop, maintain, and apply 
</p>
<p>technical knowledge of the main areas of activity. They deal with the more tech-
</p>
<p>nical aspects of equipment operation and sustainment and provide a resource 
</p>
<p>which can respond to technical problems which cannot be resolved by line man-
</p>
<p>agers and maintainers. They maintain contacts with original equipment manu-
</p>
<p>facturers (OEMs), with local support services and with suppliers. They maintain 
</p>
<p>knowledge of technical developments, including condition monitoring tech-
</p>
<p>niques. They carry out studies of technical problems leading to improvements 
</p>
<p>in reliability, maintainability, and availability. Depending on organizational size 
</p>
<p>and dispersal, they may be centralized to a greater or lesser extent with com-
</p>
<p>pany asset management. Technical changes to assets, operations, or mainte-
</p>
<p>nance regimes must be cleared by the appropriate technical authority before 
</p>
<p>implementation.
</p>
<p>11.6  Asset Management Plans
</p>
<p>11.6.1  ISO 55000 Definition and Requirements
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;Asset Management Plan&rdquo; is defined in ISO 55000 as:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;documented information that specifies the activities, resources and timescales 
</p>
<p>required for an individual asset or grouping of assets to achieve the organization&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>asset management objectives.&rdquo;1
</p>
<p>Thus, ISO 55000 defines an Asset Management Plan as referring to a specific 
</p>
<p>asset or group of assets, and involving specifying:
</p>
<p>&bull; Activities
</p>
<p>&bull; Resources
</p>
<p>&bull; Timescales.
</p>
<p>ISO 55001 states that &ldquo;the organization shall establish, document and maintain 
</p>
<p>asset management plans&hellip;&rdquo;2 Thus asset management plans are a required feature 
</p>
<p>for compliance with the standard.
</p>
<p>An asset management plan as defined in ISO 55000 is a conventional plan for 
</p>
<p>managing an asset or group of assets. This is different from the ISO 55000 defini-
</p>
<p>tion of the Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP), despite the similarity in the 
</p>
<p>name. The SAMP is discussed in a later chapter.
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55000 at Clause 3.3.3.
2 ISO 55001 at Clause 6.2.2: &ldquo;The organization shall establish&hellip;asset management plans&hellip;&rdquo;.

<p>192 11 Management of In-Service Assets
</p>
<p>11.6.2  Life Cycle Asset Management Plan
</p>
<p>There are two very distinct types of asset management plans which arise in prac-
</p>
<p>tice. The first is the Life Cycle Asset Management Plan which was discussed in 
</p>
<p>the chapter on Life Cycle Costing. A Life Cycle Asset Management Plan is a plan 
</p>
<p>formed by identifying the maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities for the par-
</p>
<p>ticular asset type.
</p>
<p>For example, for an aero engine of a given type, we plan the series of mainte-
</p>
<p>nance actions required, based on its flying hours from new, including when the 
</p>
<p>engine would require heavy maintenance and eventual replacement. The plan 
</p>
<p>would also tell us, the facilities that were required and the spares and labor needed 
</p>
<p>at various stages for engines of this particular type.
</p>
<p>11.6.3  Planning-Period Asset Management Plan
</p>
<p>A Planning-Period Asset Management Plan is a plan that is for the management of 
</p>
<p>a whole portfolio of assets over a given time period, such as 1, 5, or 10 years. This 
</p>
<p>is the type of plan that we need for developing budget proposals for the manage-
</p>
<p>ment of our in-service assets.
</p>
<p>In the aero engine case, the planning-period asset management plan considers 
</p>
<p>all the aero engines of a given type, and possibly of several types where their need 
</p>
<p>for resources interacts. The planning-period plan draws information from the Life 
</p>
<p>Cycle Asset Management Plans of individual engines or engine types to create a 
</p>
<p>plan for a given time period for the portfolio as a whole.
</p>
<p>To give another example, suppose that we are managing a vehicle fleet. The 
</p>
<p>Life Cycle Asset Management Plans for a given type of vehicle are the plans 
</p>
<p>for vehicles of that type, usually developed from the manufacturers&rsquo; specifica-
</p>
<p>tions, showing their servicing requirements, augmented by estimates for repairs, 
</p>
<p>assembly or component replacements, and so on. The Planning-Period Asset 
</p>
<p>Management Plan is the plan for a given period of time for the whole facility 
</p>
<p>which involves a mixture of vehicles of various types of varying numbers, varying 
</p>
<p>ages, and with varying demands.
</p>
<p>The Planning-Period Asset Management Plans form the basis for budgetary pro-
</p>
<p>posals for CAPEX and OPEX to provide ongoing support for sustainment of the fleet. 
</p>
<p>The Planning-Period Asset Management Plans should align with the Life Cycle Asset 
</p>
<p>Management plans for individual assets, and with the business operating requirements.
</p>
<p>11.6.4  Planning Overview
</p>
<p>In this chapter we consider Planning-Period Asset Management Plans. We shall 
</p>
<p>assume that Life Cycle Asset Management Plans are available.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>193
</p>
<p>Asset management planning focuses on the alignment of assets with the 
</p>
<p>requirements of an organization to enable maximum return of value. The aim is 
</p>
<p>to produce plans over given time horizons, which are achievable from all perspec-
</p>
<p>tives, that is, operationally, financially, and in terms of the required assets and sup-
</p>
<p>porting services. This involves the integration of:
</p>
<p>&bull; operational plans,
</p>
<p>&bull; financial plans and
</p>
<p>&bull; asset management plans.
</p>
<p>The asset management plans will take into account the life cycle activities and 
</p>
<p>logistic support needed to sustain the assets. The planning process will involve the 
</p>
<p>creation of asset management plans for individual assets or groups of assets which 
</p>
<p>will be coordinated with operational plans and the financial plans.
</p>
<p>Plans for individual assets or groups of assets will feed up into a consolidated 
</p>
<p>asset management plan which typically will involve some prioritization and selec-
</p>
<p>tion from the lower level plans. Figure 11.2 illustrates the process in a schematic 
</p>
<p>way. The consolidated asset management plan is integrated with the operational 
</p>
<p>plan and the financial plan and budget at business level to produce a coordinated 
</p>
<p>set of plans for the organization.
</p>
<p>Inputs to the asset management planning process are both &ldquo;Top Down&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bottom 
</p>
<p>Up.&rdquo; Top-Down inputs will be in response to changes from external sources, such as 
</p>
<p>market demand, product changes, technical changes, or changes in the business struc-
</p>
<p>ture or strategy. These will directly affect the business plan and this in turn will affect 
</p>
<p>the asset management plans. Bottom-Up inputs will come from the need to replace or 
</p>
<p>upgrade equipment, changes in service level expectations or technical change.

<p>194 11 Management of In-Service Assets
</p>
<p>It is important that the asset management plans respond to all these inputs. 
</p>
<p>The resulting changes in the plans will lead to financial proposals to support 
</p>
<p>the necessary physical changes. There must then be an effective business-level 
</p>
<p>response, so that funding is available, and is suitably delegated, in order to keep 
</p>
<p>the assets in step with the business strategy.
</p>
<p>11.6.5  Asset Management Plan Inputs
</p>
<p>The elements that go into making an asset management plan for a group of assets 
</p>
<p>can be summarized as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of the assets planned for in the plan (includes asset register references)
</p>
<p>&bull; Outline of business objectives and plans for which the assets are required
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of responsibilities in relation to the plan
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset criticality, priority
</p>
<p>&bull; Forecast demand
</p>
<p>&bull; Demand management
</p>
<p>&bull; Service levels planned and current actual
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance activities including overhaul or refurbishment
</p>
<p>&bull; Remaining lives
</p>
<p>&bull; Renewal plan
</p>
<p>&bull; Support services, e.g., spares, maintenance facilities, information systems
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk and contingency
</p>
<p>&bull; Communication
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset values
</p>
<p>&bull; Configuration management
</p>
<p>&bull; Change management.
</p>
<p>11.6.6  Planning Considerations
</p>
<p>Asset management plans will be developed for major assets or groups of assets. 
</p>
<p>The plans combine operational, capital, and maintenance aspects of the man-
</p>
<p>agement of the assets and form the basis for input into the CAPEX and OPEX 
</p>
<p>budgets. For any given major asset or asset group, the asset management plan will 
</p>
<p>cover the following points:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify and list the relevant assets, any related projects (e.g., existing acquisi-
</p>
<p>tions or disposals in progress) and specifically related systems and facilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Summarize the current role of, need for and criticality of the assets including 
</p>
<p>operational and financial significance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Report on the current status of the asset in terms of condition, performance, 
</p>
<p>functionality, regulatory compliance, and maintenance cost (including reliabil-
</p>
<p>ity, availability, maintenance backlog) of the asset.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>195
</p>
<p>&bull; Compare the status of the asset with current service standards and operational 
</p>
<p>and regulatory requirements.
</p>
<p>&bull; Predict the status and performance over the planning period.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify where the asset is performing below the required standard now, or at 
</p>
<p>projected times in the planning period.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify actions required to maintain the assets to the required standard over the 
</p>
<p>planning period. Actions involved may be: Do Nothing, Replace, Refurbish, 
</p>
<p>Modify, Augment.
</p>
<p>&bull; Preliminary review, financial analysis, and business case.
</p>
<p>&bull; Take the results for this asset or asset group forward for consideration in the 
</p>
<p>Consolidated Asset Management Plan.
</p>
<p>11.6.7  Consolidated Asset Management Plan
</p>
<p>A consolidated asset management plan is plan which consolidates information 
</p>
<p>from individual asset management plans and applies to a stated time period. The 
</p>
<p>consolidation process may involve some coordination and prioritization. The crea-
</p>
<p>tion of a Consolidated Asset Management Plan is a step in developing the financial 
</p>
<p>budget needed to support the assets and the asset management system.
</p>
<p>Having developed plans for individual major assets and groups of assets, we 
</p>
<p>take these forward for consideration in the consolidated asset management plan. 
</p>
<p>This plan, as the name suggests, consolidates the requirements from the individual 
</p>
<p>asset management plans into a single plan across the business. The actions arising 
</p>
<p>from the individual plans are now treated as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Bring forward actions from individual asset management plans
</p>
<p>&bull; Review actions from integrated standpoint
</p>
<p>&bull; Prioritize actions
</p>
<p>&bull; Financial analysis and business case
</p>
<p>&bull; Final approval process
</p>
<p>&bull; Create project plans for acquisitions, refurbishments, disposal, etc.
</p>
<p>11.6.8  Plan Summary
</p>
<p>The resulting consolidated plan consists of the follow main elements.
</p>
<p>&bull; Schedule of major maintenance activities, e.g., shutdowns or refurbishments.
</p>
<p>&bull; Changes in resource allocations by location, quantity, and time.
</p>
<p>&bull; Schedule of proposed acquisitions with timings.
</p>
<p>&bull; Schedule of proposed disposals with timings.
</p>
<p>&bull; CAPEX and OPEX financial plan or proposal with business case.
</p>
<p>&bull; Allocation of responsibilities in relation to the plan.

<p>196 11 Management of In-Service Assets
</p>
<p>The consolidated asset management plan goes forward as part of the budgeting 
</p>
<p>process. This process is summarized in Fig. 11.3.
</p>
<p>11.7  Time Period (e.g., 5 Year) Asset Management Plan
</p>
<p>11.7.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>There is a requirement within organizations for a document which provides an 
</p>
<p>overview of the current and projected asset plan over various time periods, e.g., 
</p>
<p>a 5- or 10 year horizon. This document is not a budget submission but is based 
</p>
<p>Are improvements required in 
</p>
<p>the level of service, 
</p>
<p>availability, performance or 
</p>
<p>functionality?
</p>
<p>Are there potential savings in 
</p>
<p>the cost of operation and 
</p>
<p>maintenance from asset related 
</p>
<p>changes?
</p>
<p>Are there issues in 
</p>
<p>maintenance backlogs, logistic 
</p>
<p>support or information systems 
</p>
<p>that require action?
</p>
<p>Establish regular feedback 
</p>
<p>from operators, users and 
</p>
<p>maintainers.
</p>
<p>Are there risks to safety, 
</p>
<p>health or environment that 
</p>
<p>require action?
</p>
<p>Are there business 
</p>
<p>opportunities or developments 
</p>
<p>that require addressing
</p>
<p>Keep calm and carry on with 
</p>
<p>existing asset management 
</p>
<p>policies.
</p>
<p>Consider acquisitions
</p>
<p>Consider replacements
</p>
<p>Consider disposals
</p>
<p>Consider changes in:
</p>
<p>Maintenance staffing
</p>
<p>Maintenance location
</p>
<p>Training
</p>
<p>Consider changes to

<p>on a combination of the agreed or projected budget commitments over the plan-
</p>
<p>ning period. This document outlines the current assets and their status, the driv-
</p>
<p>ers, external and internal, which influence current asset requirements, and the 
</p>
<p>asset plans and expenditures for given future planning periods. I shall refer to this 
</p>
<p>document as the 5 Year Asset Management Plan, although variations on this title 
</p>
<p>may be preferred or already exist in organizations, and the actual planning horizon 
</p>
<p>can be longer or shorter. This document is of interest to a range of stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>including senior management, asset managers, and managers in areas outside of 
</p>
<p>the asset management team.
</p>
<p>11.7.2  Relationship to the SAMP
</p>
<p>The 5 year Asset Management Plan is an asset management plan in the sense 
</p>
<p>defined in ISO55000.3 That is to say, it focusses on activities, resources, and time-
</p>
<p>scales. The SAMP,4 which is discussed in a later chapter, by contrast, focusses on 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;how to&rdquo; information on the asset management system as a whole. The SAMP is 
</p>
<p>particularly relevant for ISO55000 accreditation as it describes how the broad 
</p>
<p>requirements of the standard are to be met. The SAMP and the 5 Year Asset 
</p>
<p>Management Plan will have some material in common. The extent to which they 
</p>
<p>are merged or linked into a single document is at the discretion of the 
</p>
<p>organization.
</p>
<p>11.7.3  Role of the 5 Year Asset Management Plan
</p>
<p>The 5 year Asset Management Plan serves the following purposes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Informs senior management and other stakeholders of the current role and status 
</p>
<p>of assets
</p>
<p>&bull; Informs senior management and other stakeholders of the current role and status 
</p>
<p>of asset management and the systems used to support it
</p>
<p>&bull; Summarizes asset management plans for both assets and support services over 
</p>
<p>the designated planning horizon
</p>
<p>&bull; Links the current business plans and asset management plans
</p>
<p>&bull; Links the asset plans to the CAPEX and OPEX budgets.

<p>200 11 Management of In-Service Assets
</p>
<p>11.8  Configuration Management5
</p>
<p>Configuration management involves keeping track of technical details of the 
</p>
<p>assets in a fleet in regard to all the factors which are important for operation and 
</p>
<p>maintenance. It provides information for operators, maintainers, and engineers 
</p>
<p>in dealing with activities relating to the assets. A configuration management plan 
</p>
<p>should be established as part of the logistic support plan. If configuration man-
</p>
<p>agement is lacking, an organization can easily find itself with an unknown mix-
</p>
<p>ture of equipment configurations, creating problems for operations, maintenance, 
</p>
<p>and logistic support. Configuration management is important in relation to change 
</p>
<p>management.
</p>
<p>11.8.1  Configuration Management Example
</p>
<p>Consider an organization which operates a large fleet of buses, perhaps as many 
</p>
<p>as 1,000. Buses will have been bought at different times and will have different 
</p>
<p>specifications. Configuration management involves keeping track of the details of 
</p>
<p>the buses in the fleet in regard to all the factors which are important for bus oper-
</p>
<p>ation and maintenance. The operators of the buses will need to have up-to-date 
</p>
<p>information for each bus regarding such factors as: the number of seats, standard 
</p>
<p>of comfort, audio or video equipment on board. Older buses may be subject to 
</p>
<p>different regulatory design rules from newer buses. Some buses may have been 
</p>
<p>upgraded, for example, by adding seat belts, but this may not apply to all buses 
</p>
<p>which are otherwise similar. Maintenance personnel will require access to draw-
</p>
<p>ings and specifications for maintenance and repair tasks.
</p>
<p>11.8.2  Configuration Description
</p>
<p>The configuration description of a capability is a description, usually held in a 
</p>
<p>computer database, which gives details of the configuration. The fields in the con-
</p>
<p>figuration description need to be defined as a preliminary to creating the configura-
</p>
<p>tion descriptions for the relevant assets.
</p>
<p>Configuration management, including drawings and all relevant details, is 
</p>
<p>required for:
</p>
<p>&bull; Land,
</p>
<p>&bull; Buildings,
</p>
<p>&bull; Machinery and equipment,
</p>
<p>5 ISO 10007 Configuration Management.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>&bull; Water, electricity and gas supply,
</p>
<p>&bull; Drainage,
</p>
<p>&bull; Sewerage,
</p>
<p>&bull; Roads,
</p>
<p>&bull; Bridges,
</p>
<p>&bull; Embankments and civil works,
</p>
<p>&bull; Piping and instrumentation in chemical, oil, and gas plant,
</p>
<p>&bull; Software and electronic systems installed in or used with assets.
</p>
<p>11.8.3  Configuration Management Process
</p>
<p>The configuration management process involves creating the configuration 
</p>
<p>description, coordinating, controlling, approving and recording configuration 
</p>
<p>changes, and auditing physical configurations to ensure that the necessary capabil-
</p>
<p>ity is deliverable. Without tight configuration management, capability can be lost 
</p>
<p>due to the loss of essential components or features, through shifting priorities and 
</p>
<p>lack of awareness of the capability requirements.
</p>
<p>11.8.4  Configuration Change Control
</p>
<p>Configuration change control involves the analysis of proposed changes, combin-
</p>
<p>ing technical and business viewpoints, and the application of a formal procedure 
</p>
<p>for the approval of agreed changes. Changes need to be evaluated in regard to 
</p>
<p>their functional and logistic implications before being implemented. Records of 
</p>
<p>actual configurations are made and changes are recorded as they are implemented. 
</p>
<p>Awareness of and adherence to design and construction standards is an important 
</p>
<p>factor in the approval of configuration changes. The configuration change control 
</p>
<p>process should ensure that related technical information is updated as changes 
</p>
<p>occur. Configuration audits should be carried out to ensure that configuration 
</p>
<p>records are being maintained.

<p>b. A Planning-Period Asset Management Plan is a plan is for the management of 
</p>
<p>a whole portfolio of assets over a given time period, such a 1, 5, or 10 years. 
</p>
<p>This is the type of plan that we need for developing budget proposals for the 
</p>
<p>management of our in-service assets.
</p>
<p>4. What top-down factors can influence the management plan for in-service 
</p>
<p>assets?
</p>
<p>a. Market demand,
</p>
<p>b. Product changes,
</p>
<p>c. Technical changes,
</p>
<p>d. Changes in the business structure or strategy,
</p>
<p>e. Changes to the business plan.
</p>
<p>5. What bottom-up factors can influence the management plan for in-service 
</p>
<p>assets?
</p>
<p>a. Need to replace equipment
</p>
<p>b. Need to upgrade equipment
</p>
<p>c. Need to maintain, restore, or upgrade the service level
</p>
<p>d. Technical or regulatory changes affecting operations or maintenance.
</p>
<p>6. Identify four reasons for having a planning-period (e.g., 5 year) asset manage-
</p>
<p>ment plan.
</p>
<p>a. Informs senior management and other stakeholders of the current role and 
</p>
<p>status of assets
</p>
<p>b. Informs senior management and other stakeholders of the current role and 
</p>
<p>status of the systems used to support the assets
</p>
<p>c. Summarizes asset management plans for both assets and support services 
</p>
<p>over the designated planning horizon
</p>
<p>d. Links the current business plans and asset management plans
</p>
<p>e. Links the asset plans to the CAPEX and OPEX budgets.

<p>11.10.2  Configuration Management Solutions
</p>
<p>1. What is configuration management?
</p>
<p>a. Configuration management involves keeping track of technical details of the 
</p>
<p>assets in a fleet in regard to all the factors which are important for operation 
</p>
<p>and maintenance.
</p>
<p>2. Why is configuration management needed?
</p>
<p>a. If configuration management is lacking, an organization can find itself with 
</p>
<p>an unknown mixture of equipment configurations, creating problems for 
</p>
<p>operations, maintenance, and logistic support. Configuration management is 
</p>
<p>important in relation to change management.

<p>&ldquo;You got a new ute?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cleaned it,&rdquo; said Norm.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the roll-bar, that&rsquo;s new. Who put it on?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little fabrication shop near the old pearl luggers. We all have them now. 
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a contract to do Non-Destructive Testing on the gas pipelines. Our boss </p>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>rolled his ute on a trip to Uranus Island and was lucky only to break his arm, so 
</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s become a safety thing. Weren&rsquo;t you supposed to get roll-bars ages ago?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too right. It was after we had a fatal down by the dinosaur footprints. They 
</p>
<p>sent out an engineer, Tom Peirce&mdash;I knew him from uni&mdash;and he drew up plans 
</p>
<p>for roll-bars. But nothing happened. I saw him again later and he said that the 
</p>
<p>engineering branch had said that they couldn&rsquo;t approve it because there wasn&rsquo;t an 
</p>
<p>official standard to check it against.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a cop-out. They don&rsquo;t want to sign off and then get blamed if it&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>not perfect.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Tom said the operations people pushed them on it and they decided 
</p>
<p>to do some tests. Apparently his design only covered 90 % of situations.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;90 % would be better than 0 %.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was another problem. We bought these utes over a few years and some 
</p>
<p>were imported, some locally assembled from kits and some modified since in vari-

<p>&ldquo;Short of money! Not Canberra. No, there were actually going to do it, but

<p>wasn&rsquo;t worth doing.&rdquo;

<p>12.1  Capital Planning Considerations
</p>
<p>The allocation of resources within a company involves top management judg-
</p>
<p>ment, taking many factors into account. The financial viability of the organization 
</p>
<p>is the leading concern, and in this respect, resources should be directed to those 
</p>
<p>areas which have the best prospects for producing value. Value can arise in sev-
</p>
<p>eral forms, the most common being a financial return on investment. Value may be 
</p>
<p>sought by generating new business, or by increasing production leading to greater 
</p>
<p>sales volume, and in turn to greater sales value. Or the return may arise by reduc-
</p>
<p>ing costs or alleviating bottlenecks.
</p>
<p>At the same time as financial returns are being sought, it is important to take 
</p>
<p>into account of other factors which are more defensive in nature. These include the

<p>12.1.1  Cyclic Aspect
</p>
<p>The condition and performance of a company&rsquo;s assets can often be allowed to deteriorate 
while still providing adequate service. Eventually in the life cycle of assets, the condition 
may reach a critical threshold where performance is difficult to sustain without significant 
expenditure. Understanding where you are in the cycle, and being able to evidence it, is 
critical to sound asset management, and to preparing financial and regulatory submissions

</p>
<p>12.2  What is a Budget?
</p>
<p>A budget is an allocation of financial resources to a specific function or area, and 
</p>
<p>represents a commitment on the part of management to the corresponding activ-
</p>
<p>ity. Conversely, lack of a budget allocation to an activity is a de facto indication of 
</p>
<p>lack of management commitment to that activity.
</p>
<p>Budgets are generally based on reasoned proposals, and they help to promote 
</p>
<p>good planning and a considered allocation of resources. Changes to budgets 
</p>
<p>require senior management approval and require significant justification. Budgets 
</p>
<p>help managers at all levels to plan and control business activity.
</p>
<p>12.3  Types of Budget
</p>
<p>In asset management there are two types of budget:
</p>
<p>a. Capital Budget, known as CAPEX = Capital Expenditure
</p>
<p>b. Operating and Maintenance Budget, known as OPEX = Operating Expenditure
</p>
<p>The capital budget is used to purchase fixed assets and the operating budget 
</p>
<p>is used to operate the business and to purchase expense items. The difference 
</p>
<p>between the two is dictated partly by taxation systems which allow operating 
</p>
<p>expenditure to be deducted from income in the current year in determining taxable 
</p>
<p>income, whereas, only the depreciation of fixed assets is allowed as a current year 
</p>
<p>tax deduction. Also, the two types of budget require quite different management. 
</p>
<p>The operating budget is used by operating departments to cover outlays required 
</p>
<p>to support their immediate activities, such as wages, materials, rents, and equip-
</p>
<p>ment lease payments. The capital budget is used to acquire major items of plant 
</p>
<p>and equipment, requiring analysis of the business needs and investment options, 
</p>
<p>followed by detailed acquisition planning and implementation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>209
</p>
<p>The separation of budgets into CAPEX and OPEX can have some undesirable 
</p>
<p>consequences. For example, there may be excessive OPEX expenditure in order 
</p>
<p>to maintain aging equipment which should have been replaced earlier from the 
</p>
<p>CAPEX budget.
</p>
<p>The term TOTEX or Total Budget Expenditure refers to the total of CAPEX 
</p>
<p>and OPEX. The TOTEX concept has value in drawing attention to the need to con-
</p>
<p>sider the interactions between the budgets, and ultimately, the total cost involved 
</p>
<p>in supporting the asset functions. However, the interaction between CAPEX and 
</p>
<p>OPEX is quite complex.
</p>
<p>12.4  Budget Structure
</p>
<p>Figure 12.1 shows a typical budgetary structure for a large corporation.
</p>
<p>12.5  Devolution of Authority
</p>
<p>An issue in the organization of a corporation is the extent to which author-
</p>
<p>ity should be delegated or devolved down to subsidiary levels. As an example, 
</p>
<p>in a state-wide water supply system, initially there were 10 regions. Each region 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;owned&rdquo; its local assets, and managed them&mdash;some well, some not so well. 
</p>
<p>Because each region was small, their buying power, their access to capital funds, 
</p>
<p>and their degree of technical support were limited.
</p>
<p>To overcome these problems, ownership and decision making were centralized. 
</p>
<p>This addressed the perceived problems, but had the disadvantage that local manag-
</p>
<p>ers felt less interest in and less authority over, the assets in their region. In many 
</p>
<p>cases the assets deteriorated.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my problem,&rdquo; the local managers said, as they disowned the remote cen-
</p>
<p>tralized bureaucracy.

<p>210 12 Capital Planning and Budget
</p>
<p>To strike a balance, the asset ownership was devolved back to four large 
</p>
<p>regions, with positive effects. Technical and financial support functions remained 
</p>
<p>centralized. The benefits and disbenefits of centralization are debatable, but it 
</p>
<p>is important to keep users involved. The saying is: &ldquo;big enough to cope, small 
</p>
<p>enough to care&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>An example of a budgetary financial delegation policy is shown in Table 4.1 
</p>
<p>Financial Delegation Example.
</p>
<p>12.6  Organizational Planning Process
</p>
<p>Capital asset planning and budgeting involve identifying the most beneficial use 
</p>
<p>of funds, planning, and scheduling the application of funds and arranging for the 
</p>
<p>availability of those funds. Capital planning and budgeting are integral to the busi-
</p>
<p>ness development plan. The plan may involve consolidation, risk reduction, or out-
</p>
<p>sourcing and is not necessarily expansionist.
</p>
<p>The business development plan leads into a capital expenditure program. This 
</p>
<p>will be consolidated across a number of different capability requirement areas. 
</p>
<p>To check the financial viability of the whole program the organization will create 
</p>
<p>analyses showing:
</p>
<p> i. Budgeted cash flow
</p>
<p> ii. Budgeted balance sheets
</p>
<p> iii. Budgeted profit and loss accounts.
</p>
<p>The detailed development of these analyses will be an accounting or financial 
</p>
<p>planning function rather than an asset management function, so we shall not con-
</p>
<p>sider them in detail. However, it is important that the data provided as a basis for 
</p>
<p>these reports is as accurate as possible and this will require asset management 
</p>
<p>input. The results may lead us to question the choice of earlier options, and may 
</p>
<p>require modification for risk.
</p>
<p>12.7  Asset Planning Process1
</p>
<p>In earlier chapters we have seen how the asset planning process involves several 
</p>
<p>areas of development. The life cycle of specific assets is taken into account in 
</p>
<p>determining Life Cycle Asset Management Plans. The continuity of asset provi-
</p>
<p>sion is taken into account in Asset Continuity Planning. The requirement to match 
</p>
<p>the needs of the business is taken into account in all the plans, but specifically in 
</p>
<p>Capability Requirements Planning. The need to provide for and respond to support 
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55001 Clause 8.1 Operational planning and control: &ldquo;The organization shall &hellip;implement 
processes&hellip;to implement the&hellip;asset management plans&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>for the In-Service Assets are taken into account in the creation of Planning-Period 
</p>
<p>Asset Management plans. The Planning-Period Asset Management Plans for lower 
</p>
<p>levels of the organization are subsequently consolidated to produce Consolidated 
</p>
<p>Asset Management Plans. These form the basis for budget proposals, leading ulti-
</p>
<p>mately to budget financial allocations. The process is summarized in Fig. 12.2.
</p>
<p>12.7.1  Planning Periods
</p>
<p>The capital expenditure program will consider a range of planning periods, such 
</p>
<p>as 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 year horizons. A rolling review will also apply, as circum-
</p>
<p>stances develop. A balance must be struck between stability and flexibility in 
</p>
<p>regard to changing situations. An appreciation of the lead times involved in imple-
</p>
<p>menting asset acquisition plans is essential, so we will need to firm up on our 
</p>
<p>plans for particular projects for a given period ahead, dependent on the lead times 
</p>
<p>involved.
</p>
<p>12.7.2  Source and Application of Funds
</p>
<p>It is not unusual for owners or senior management to have favored areas which do 
</p>
<p>not correspond to those which are most profitable for the business. For example, a

<p>railway may get the bulk of its net revenue from freight operations, but may direct 
</p>
<p>the major part of its budget to passenger operations. Significant mismatches in the 
</p>
<p>source and application of funds create a danger for any organization and should be 
</p>
<p>guarded against. However, King Louis XIV is said to have appropriated one-third 
</p>
<p>of the revenue of France to his personal use. He got away with it, but eventually 
</p>
<p>his successors did not.
</p>
<p>12.8  Capital Requirement Plans for Asset Types
</p>
<p>Capital requirement plans for all asset types are developed, usually as part of an 
</p>
<p>annual activity cycle. These are then consolidated into a master development and 
</p>
<p>capital budget plan. The steps are summarized in Fig. 12.3. The consolidation 
</p>
<p>across types is summarized in Fig. 12.4. Asset managers need to be fully aware of, 
</p>
<p>and actively involved in the organization&rsquo;s capital budget planning process. The 
</p>
<p>bringing together of asset knowledge and business and financial knowledge into a 
</p>
<p>sound decision making process is an essential part of the asset management contri-
</p>
<p>bution to the well-being of the organization.

<p>12.9  Capital Budgeting Cycle
</p>
<p>Within an organization, the capital budgeting process generally follows an annual 
</p>
<p>cycle. There must also be provision for the response to emergency or unforeseen cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances. A typical cycle can be as follows. This is based on a January&ndash;December 
</p>
<p>annual cycle, but would vary to fit in with the relevant financial year timings.
</p>
<p>1. February&ndash;March&mdash;Departmental level
</p>
<p> a. Review life cycle asset management plans for major assets
</p>
<p> b. Review current condition of assets
</p>
<p> c. Determine status of current asset related projects
</p>
<p> d. Review proposed acquisitions
</p>
<p> e. Review proposed replacements
</p>
<p> f. Review proposed overhauls
</p>
<p> g. Review proposed disposals
</p>
<p> h. Review proposed developments or opportunities
</p>
<p> i. Review capital requirements for facilities.
</p>
<p>2. April&mdash;Departmental level
</p>
<p>a. Consolidate physical proposals in consultation with relevant managers
</p>
<p>b. Prepare costings in consultation with finance personnel.
</p>
<p>3. May&ndash;June&mdash;Business level
</p>
<p>a. Consolidate physical proposals from departments and review priorities and 
</p>
<p>costings. Prioritize list of proposals.
</p>
<p>4. July&ndash;August&mdash;Business level
</p>
<p>a. Capital budget proposals submitted for the following year.
</p>
<p>5. September&mdash;Budget deliberations
</p>
<p>6. October&mdash;Budget approved and issued for the following year.
</p>
<p>7. November&mdash;Commence implementation of budget.
</p>
<p>12.10  Capital Rationing
</p>
<p>The requests on the capital budget often exceed the finance available. The prioriti-
</p>
<p>zation of projects, and the making of decisions as to what items can be included in 
</p>
<p>a given capital budget is known as capital rationing.
</p>
<p>Some projects may be nondiscretionary in a regulatory sense&mdash;they have to be 
</p>
<p>done. This typically includes, risk mitigation for health and safety, environmen-
</p>
<p>tal protection, or reliability improvement in critical areas. Other projects may be 
</p>
<p>essential to the business, such as maintaining the continuity of assets which pro-
</p>
<p>vide essential services. Other projects may be discretionary, but nevertheless 
</p>

<p>214 12 Capital Planning and Budget
</p>
<p>important to the future success of the business. A major factor in capital budgeting 
</p>
<p>is the financial return on capital invested.
</p>
<p>The age and technical profile of major capital equipment will be determined by 
</p>
<p>the pattern of installations in the past. We need to ensure that sufficient capital is 
</p>
<p>allocated to meet the requirements for replacement and technical advance. Lumpy 
</p>
<p>replacement patterns give rise to uneven capital requirements. Other things being 
</p>
<p>equal, smoother capital demands through time are easier to manage. However, if 
</p>
<p>major capital expenditure is justified it should be accepted and managed.
</p>
<p>12.10.1  Capital Rationing Example&mdash;Postal Vans
</p>
<p>A simple type of capital rationing decision occurs when a fleet of relatively small 
</p>
<p>items requires on-going renewal.
</p>
<p>Example Newistan Postal Service has a large fleet of vans, but a limited budget 
</p>
<p>for van replacement. The replacement policy is to budget a selected amount each 
</p>
<p>year to replace a number of oldest and highest mileage vans. Some contingency 
</p>
<p>capital is also set aside for spend-limit replacements, that is where an expensive 
</p>
<p>repair is required which is not justified in terms of the estimated remaining life of 
</p>
<p>the vehicle, even though that vehicle would not normally be replaced on grounds 
</p>
<p>of age alone.
</p>
<p>The vans are identified by registration number. A list of vans is made by age in 
</p>
<p>years and, within years, by kilometers run. Vans are then replaced down the list as 
</p>
<p>far as the capital budget will allow.
</p>
<p>Figure 12.5 shows an example in which vans at the oldest ages in the fleet have 
</p>
<p>been listed in descending order by age, and within age groups, in descending order 
</p>
<p>by kilometers run. A budget of $200,000 has been allocated for replacements and 
</p>
<p>the vans cost $45,000 each. The budget allows the vans shown in the shaded area 
</p>
<p>to be replaced. In practice some flexibility in application may allow engineering 
</p>
<p>judgement of van condition to influence the precise outcome.

</p>
<p>12.10.2  Replacement Prioritization
</p>
<p>In the vehicle fleet example just given, it is easy to rank the vehicles in priority 
</p>
<p>order for replacement, since they are all basically the same. In other cases, we 
</p>
<p>need to create a ranking system, based on factors such as condition and criticality. 
</p>
<p>In order to establish a consistent terminology we can define descriptors for condi-
</p>
<p>tion and for criticality as shown in Fig. 12.6.
</p>
<p>The budget proposal then shows the condition and criticality of various pro-
</p>
<p>posed replacements. Figure 12.7 shows an example, with the replacement decision 
</p>
<p>shown in the right-hand column. We see that replacement was approved for items 
</p>
<p>1&ndash;4 but not for items 5 and 6.
</p>
<p>12.10.3  Condition/Criticality Plot
</p>
<p>An example of a type of graphical display which can illustrate the status of many 
</p>
<p>items on one page is shown in Fig. 12.8. This type of plot gives a compact view of 
</p>
<p>the overall status of an organization&rsquo;s assets to senior management.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216 12 Capital Planning and Budget
</p>
<p>12.10.4  Financial Return
</p>
<p>For new projects the financial returns are usually measured by the Internal Rate 
</p>
<p>of Return (IRR). The definition and calculation of this measure are considered in 
</p>
<p>another chapter.
</p>
<p>12.10.5  Risk
</p>
<p>Another factor that needs to be taken into account is the risks involved if a pro-
</p>
<p>ject is or is not undertaken. This may be concerned with safety, regulatory require-
</p>
<p>ments, or a risk of business loss or lost opportunity.
</p>
<p>From the point of view of the asset manager, it is advisable to make clear 
</p>
<p>to senior management the risks involved both in carrying out a project and also 
</p>
<p>in failing to approve a project. It is then up to senior management to make a 
</p>
<p>final decision. The advantage of the risk-based approach is that it can create a 
</p>
<p>situation of positive dialog between asset managers and senior management as 
</p>
<p>the merits and risks of various projects are discussed. A reasonably argued case 
</p>
<p>should be presented for each project, without crying wolf or being smart after 
</p>
<p>the event.
</p>
<p>Figure 12.9 shows an example where a number of projects have been presented 
</p>
<p>to a budget committee. The list includes projects which have been included for 
</p>
<p>environmental or safety reasons, and ones which are profit motivated and show 
</p>
<p>their internal rate of return (IRR). The right-hand column shows the ranking of the 
</p>
<p>projects by the committee. The rank 1 project is seen as essential from an environ-
</p>
<p>mental and regulatory point of view. The rank 2 project has a high-internal rate of 
</p>
<p>return and is seen as essential to the on-going needs of the business. The rank 3 
</p>
<p>project is a safety requirement, and so on.

</p>
<p>12.11  The Capital Budget
</p>
<p>Ultimately, senior management brings together the various decisions into a con-
</p>
<p>solidated capital budget. An example is shown in Fig. 12.10.
</p>
<p>12.12  Managing the Capital Project Portfolio
</p>
<p>The direction, monitoring, and control of the capital project portfolio is a major 
</p>
<p>commitment of senior management. The summary in Fig. 12.10 shows a portfo-
</p>
<p>lio of capital projects which are at various stages of development. The status col-
</p>
<p>umn shows the stage of progress for each project. The projects at the top of the 
</p>
<p>list are those that are currently in progress of acquisition or development, projects 
</p>
<p>1&ndash;3. Project 4 is approved but not yet started. Projects 5 and 6 are in the feasibil-
</p>
<p>ity planning stage, project 7 is in the pre feasibility planning stage, and projects 8 
</p>
<p>and 9 are at the requirements analysis stage. Projects will progress up the list as 
</p>
<p>their status develops toward completion. In practice, the number of projects may 
</p>
<p>be larger and separate tables may be made to focus on projects at particular stages 
</p>
<p>of development or on projects for particular areas of the business.
</p>
<p>Each project has a project manager who reports on the project to a senior man-
</p>
<p>ager in the area to which the project relates. Senior management will coordinate 
</p>
<p>progress and financial requirements. The availability of finance can depend on 
</p>
<p>many factors and is not necessarily smooth through time. Both the requirements 
</p>
<p>of the projects and the financial situation of the organization can vary depending 
</p>
<p>upon external and internal factors. It is common to find that projects slip back in 
</p>
<p>time, although this should be avoided wherever possible. Delay factors include 
</p>
<p>changes in scope (naughty), delays in specifying requirements, and delays in sup-
</p>
<p>ply. In organizations with strict annual budgeting systems, delays in one project 
</p>
<p>may work to the advantage of another.

<p>Care must be taken to identify cases where projects are interrelated, since pro-
</p>

<p>12.12.1  Capital Budget for Current Year
</p>
<p>In the shorter term, we also need to manage the capital budget for the current 
</p>
<p>year, and for other medium-term horizons. Figure 12.11 shows an example of a 
</p>
<p>current year capital budget, showing for a number of items, expenditure year to

<p>of the lead time factors in projects, the need to manage resources within and 
</p>
<p>between projects, and awareness of the risks involved, will assist the budget man-
</p>
<p>ager to work toward the best achievable outcome.
</p>
<p>12.13  Contingency Allowances
</p>
<p>Emergency, urgent, or critical work can arise which the original asset manage-
</p>
<p>ment plan and budget have not allowed for. A contingency budget should be held 
</p>
<p>to cover such situations. It is important that asset managers respond adequately to 
</p>
<p>actual or potential failures and to situations involving risks to safety or the envi-
</p>
<p>ronment. Financial support should be sought as the situation justifies.

<p>The Long River Ferry Company currently operates a fleet of small wooden ferry

<p>boats. They are planning to introduce three new, larger boats which are faster and 
</p>
<p>have air-conditioning. The larger boats will require new pontoons and there is 
</p>
<p>also a requirement that work to protect the riverbank from erosion be undertaken 
</p>
<p>before large boats are introduced. It is believed that the larger boats will increase

<p>smaller ones. If Long River does not introduce larger boats there is a distinct pos-
</p>
<p>sibility that a rival company will introduce similar boats and capture the higher 
</p>
<p>priced end of the market.
</p>
<p>Long River has three divisional managers who respectively are responsible for:
</p>
<p>1. Small boats,
</p>
<p>2. Large boat project, and
</p>
<p>3. Shore facilities.
</p>
<p>The divisional managers have produced the following budget information:
</p>
<p>Shore Facilities
</p>
<p>Pontoons $2 M required in year prior to commencement of large boat#1, and $1 M 
</p>
<p>in year prior to commencement of large boat#3.
</p>
<p>Riverbank $4 M required in year prior to commencement of large boat#1 
</p>
<p>(Figs. 12.12 and 12.13).
</p>
<p>Large boats require a payment of $3 M in the year prior to acquisition and 
</p>
<p>$5 M in the year of acquisition.

</p>
<p>options which may benefit the business in overall financial and operational terms.

<p>12.15  Are Your Assets Liabilities?
</p>
<p>Shortly after Jock joined the asset management group his boss Dan called him in. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to do a due diligence on Front-IT,&rdquo; said Dan.
</p>
<p>Jock was not sure what a due diligence was so he kept quiet. All he knew was 
</p>
<p>that Albany&mdash;the large conglomerate where he and Dan worked&mdash;were putting 
</p>
<p>together a bid for Front-IT.

</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the main idea?&rdquo; asked Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to check out their assets,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;They have nice offices in a 
</p>
<p>smart location, lots of modern computer gear and the managers all have swishy 
</p>
<p>company cars so it looks pretty good as far as I can see.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Check it out they did. The cars and the computer equipment were all leased. 
</p>
<p>The office building was 6 months into a 3-year lease&mdash;making it a cost commit-
</p>
<p>ment. The only fixed asset on the books was a backroom computer system valued 
</p>
<p>at $5,000,000&mdash;but when they got specialists to look at it, it turned out to be obso-
</p>
<p>lete and to have zero market or practical value.
</p>
<p>Dan and Jock made their report. Later at a drinks session to celebrate the acqui-
</p>
<p>sition, Sean, a lead guy on the takeover team spoke to Dan and Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did a good job on the asset evaluation,&rdquo; he said.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they weren&rsquo;t worth anything,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too right,&rdquo; said Sean, &ldquo;It brought the price down a treat.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did we go ahead,&rdquo; said Jock, puzzled.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had some heavily amortized intangibles we were interested in,&rdquo; said 
</p>
<p>Sean, turning away as though he had said too much.
</p>
<p>Jock did not know what an intangible was, much less a heavily amortized one. 
</p>
<p>Front-IT looked like a dead duck from where he saw it.
</p>
<p>At home that night it occurred to Jock that Sheila might know about intangible 
</p>
<p>assets.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I ask you a question?&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sheila, brightly.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that kind of question,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about intangible assets and 
</p>
<p>amortization.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Sheila, and she explained that an intangible asset was something 
</p>
<p>like a patent, or intellectual property or goodwill. It had value but was not money 
</p>
<p>and was not a physical thing. The value declined over time, and the decrease was 
</p>
<p>called amortization.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like depreciation,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>At work later Jock asked Dan if he knew why Albany had bought Front-IT.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently Front-IT developed an advanced safety relay for electricity trans-
</p>
<p>mission systems years ago,&rdquo; said Dan.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;They still own the patent. It seems that our guys reckon they can develop the 
</p>
<p>idea further and that we can use it on our upcoming projects and also license it out.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Jock.

<p>2. What do the abbreviations CAPEX and OPEX stand for?
</p>
<p>CAPEX is Capital Expenditure and OPEX is Operating Expenditure.
</p>
<p>3. What is capital rationing?
</p>
<p>Capital rationing is the determination of which items can be included within a

<p> limited allowable expenditure of a given budget.
</p>
<p>4. How would you monitor budgetary expenditure?
</p>
<p>a. Create a budget in a spreadsheet (or other established system) indicating the 
</p>
<p>various cost categories and the amounts allocated.
</p>
<p>b. Record actual expenditure as it occurs.
</p>
<p>c. Calculate planned expenditure for rest of the planning period. This is based 
</p>
<p>on the original budget, adjusted to allow for known or expected changes. 
</p>
<p>These may be increased or reduced relative to the original plan.
</p>
<p>d. Calculate the balance of commitments. This will be a positive amount if 
</p>
<p>there is a projected budget surplus and a negative amount if there is a pro-
</p>
<p>jected budget shortfall.
</p>
<p>e. Take steps to remain within budget, or discuss the situation with manage-

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to outline the functions of an asset  
</p>
<p>management information system and to consider issues relating to the use, 
</p>
<p>resourcing, and operation of the system. Outcomes After reading this chapter you 
</p>
<p>will know the main applications for which an asset management information sys-
</p>
<p>tem is programmed and the type of coding systems which are used to identify 
</p>
<p>equipment, locations, and activities. You will be aware of the need for adequate 
</p>
<p>resources to maintain the system and for user training in its use. You will see the 
</p>
<p>structure of the data flows and be aware of the role of the system in the on-going 
</p>
<p>management of current tasks.
</p>
<p>13.1  Information System Role and Applications1
</p>
<p>An asset management information system is a computer-based system which is 
</p>
<p>designed to assist the user to create and maintain documentation for the asset man-
</p>
<p>agement function.
</p>
<p>Asset management requires accurate, comprehensive, documented details of the 
</p>
<p>identity, operating, and maintenance parameters of equipment. This information is 
</p>
<p>utilized throughout the life cycle of the equipment by plant operating and mainte-
</p>
<p>nance personnel.
</p>
<p>Historical information aids in troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and the 
</p>
<p>identification of safety performance and improvement opportunities by provid-
</p>
<p>ing data for analysis and decision making. The records also provide evidence to 
</p>
<p>regulatory bodies that maintenance tasks are being performed so that the technical 
</p>
<p>integrity of the equipment is maintained.

<p>224 13 Asset Management Information Systems
</p>
<p>Early computer systems were developed for individual management areas, such 
</p>
<p>as maintenance, accounting, or personnel. Systems originally developed specifically 
</p>
<p>for maintenance are known as Computerized Maintenance Management Systems or 
</p>
<p>CMMS. Later, more integrated systems were developed, which may be described as 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;enterprise asset management systems&rdquo;. For asset management purposes it is desir-
</p>
<p>able to have an integrated system which covers the following applications:
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset Register including listing of maintainable assets with full range of config-
</p>
<p>uration management parameters, cost and depreciation information, valuation, 
</p>
<p>and condition information
</p>
<p>&bull; Estimating and costing
</p>
<p>&bull; Budgeting and budgetary reports
</p>
<p>&bull; Links to accounting systems
</p>

</p>
<p>These systems require extensive initial data setup, on-going data input, working 
</p>
<p>methods which are consistently applied, training, and implementation support. The 
</p>
<p>range of applications is shown in graphical form in Fig. 13.1.
</p>
<p>13.2  Base Data and the Need for Coding
</p>
<p>When a company buys an asset management software system it buys an empty data-
</p>
<p>base. To use the system, it must populate the database with data from its own busi-
</p>
<p>ness. This requires the company to establish a system for designating and coding all 
</p>
<p>the entities involved in the various applications that it requires. Systematic structuring 
</p>
<p>and coding is essential. The codings required for financial purposes and for mainte-
</p>
<p>nance purposes involve different levels of detail, and it is therefore usually necessary 
</p>
<p>to have both Account Codes and Functional Location Codes within the system.
</p>
<p>13.2.1  Fixed Plant and Functional Locations
</p>
<p>The data requirements differ to some extent between fixed and mobile equipment. 
</p>
<p>We shall consider fixed plant first.
</p>
<p>A functional location is a place where an item is located in order to carry out 
</p>
<p>a given function. In fixed or static plant or buildings, a functional location cor-
</p>
<p>responds to a place and the function of the item located there. For example, in a 
</p>
<p>house, the kitchen is a different functional location to a bathroom. Further break-
</p>
<p>down of locations would identify such functional locations as the kitchen sink, 
</p>
<p>cooker, and refrigerator locations.
</p>
<p>13.2.1.1  Why Do We Need Functional Locations?
</p>
<p>The functional location enables us to identify locations for operational and main-
</p>
<p>tenance purposes. The functional location is used on Work Requests, Work Orders, 
</p>
<p>Inspection Plans, and related documents such as safety or emergency plans. Thus 
</p>
<p>if a user has a refrigerator in a certain place which is faulty, they create a Work 
</p>
<p>Request which specifies the Functional Location. The specific item at a functional 
</p>
<p>location may change, but the functional location remains the same. Thus, if the 
</p>
<p>13.1 Information System Role and Applications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>226 13 Asset Management Information Systems
</p>
<p>refrigerator at a given functional location changes, the functional location remains 
</p>
<p>the same. If we wish to track the history of a particular refrigerator, we need to 
</p>
<p>record information which specifies the serial number.
</p>
<p>As a further example, consider a mining site. The site has different areas 
</p>
<p>and different activities within those areas. Figure 13.2 shows part of the higher 
</p>
<p>level functional location coding system for the site. Some judgment is required 
</p>
<p>in order to achieve clarity but to avoid an excess of detail. The level of detail 
</p>
<p>required for accounting purposes is generally less than that required for mainte-
</p>
<p>nance purposes.
</p>
<p>Figure 13.3 shows entries for specific assets within an area. The style of the 
</p>
<p>detailed entries will reflect the industrial application. For example, in process plant 
</p>
<p>the identification may be by drawing reference and tag number.
</p>
<p>13.2.1.2  Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Mapping
</p>
<p>For geographically dispersed assets, the GPS location is a useful feature to show 
</p>
<p>in the asset register. Maps and photographs are also valuable aids to identifying 
</p>
<p>assets and assessing condition.

<p>13.2.2  Location Code Structure
</p>
<p>The following example relates to an electricity transmission system. The sys-
</p>
<p>tem covers a number of geographic areas, labeled A, B, C, etc. Within each area 
</p>
<p>there are a number of substations. In area A the substations are labeled A01, A02, 
</p>
<p>and so on. The identifier substrings are kept to uniform length to facilitate report 
</p>
<p>generation.
</p>
<p>Within each substation there are a number of circuit breaker bays. In substa-
</p>
<p>tion A01 there are bays A01-01, A01-02, and so on. Then within a particular bay 
</p>
<p>there are individual circuit breakers, and for any circuit breaker there are important 
</p>
<p>components which include Current Transformers and Voltage Transformers (these 
</p>
<p>are instrument transformers which are part of the circuit protection system). The 
</p>
<p>coding system is illustrated in Fig. 13.4.
</p>
<p>The system enables us to identify any item down to the coded level of com-
</p>
<p>ponents. Also, in analyzing historical data, for example, all work orders relat-
</p>
<p>ing to Current Transformers can be extracted by selecting on code &ldquo;CT&rdquo; in 
</p>
<p>positions 8:9.

</p>
<p>13.2.3  Mobile Plant Coding
</p>
<p>For mobile plant, such as motor vehicles, railway wagons, or aircraft, the vehi-
</p>
<p>cles themselves will be identified by serial number. Functional locations will be 
</p>
<p>defined for the constituent internal locations. These location codes will apply to all 
</p>
<p>similar types of plant. Major assemblies for which individual tracking is required 
</p>
<p>will also be identified by serial number. Serial number tracking is necessary for 
</p>
<p>major assemblies which may move between functional locations, if their life his-
</p>
<p>tory is to be traceable.
</p>
<p>An item type, such as a particular model of diesel engine, will be identified by:
</p>
<p>&bull; Type Code
</p>
<p>&bull; Description
</p>
<p>&bull; Manufacturer
</p>
<p>&bull; Technical characteristics
</p>
<p>&bull; Power rating
</p>
<p>&bull; Number of cylinders and layout
</p>
<p>&bull; Size and weight &hellip;
</p>
<p>&bull; Bill of Materials/Spares catalog reference.
</p>
<p>A specific item, such as a particular diesel engine, will be identified by:
</p>
<p>&bull; Serial Number
</p>
<p>&bull; Type Code
</p>
<p>&bull; Date of Manufacture
</p>
<p>An example of mobile plant functional location coding is shown in Fig. 13.5 for 
</p>
<p>an electric train.

<p>13.3  Resourcing and Managing the System
</p>
<p>13.3.1  Data Administration
</p>
<p>Maintenance data administration must be a recognized activity. A combination 
</p>
<p>of staff abilities is required, since technical knowledge is needed for part of the 
</p>
<p>work, but data handling skills are a predominant requirement in other phases of 
</p>
<p>the application. Adequate and consistent resources must be allocated to creating 
</p>
<p>and maintaining the data otherwise it will quickly become worthless. This includes 
</p>
<p>keeping up-to-date the register of maintainable assets, the maintenance policies, 
</p>
<p>and supporting data such as work procedures and safety procedures.
</p>
<p>13.3.2  Information Technology Support
</p>
<p>Information technology support for the asset management information system is 
</p>
<p>essential. Developments will be on-going in terms of both the application and the 
</p>
<p>underlying information technology.

</p>
<p>13.3.3  Users
</p>
<p>All trades personnel should be familiar with the system. This familiarization must 
</p>
<p>be part of the training requirement for all potential users. It is highly desirable to 
</p>
<p>get those who enter data, typically the trades persons who carry out work, to make 
</p>
<p>use of some reporting features of the system. This will provide motivation for 
</p>
<p>maintaining the quality of the data input. The more extensively the system is used, 
</p>
<p>the greater are the benefits.
</p>
<p>13.4  Reports and Their Uses
</p>
<p>The following are examples of the type of reports which can generally be gener-
</p>
<p>ated from the asset management computer system, and some of the uses to which 
</p>
<p>these reports are put.
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset identification, location, and valuation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Budget expenditure year to date by account code, by equipment type, by loca-
</p>
<p>tion. This report helps with current budgetary management, and with the assess-
</p>
<p>ment of future resources.

</p>
<p>13.5  Document Control2
</p>
<p>A system for document control must be established in order to ensure that docu-
</p>
<p>ments are adequately protected for improper use, loss of integrity, and loss of 
</p>
<p>confidentiality.
</p>
<p>13.6  Implementing Changes
</p>
<p>A factor in the management of computer systems is the need to make changes, but 
</p>
<p>at the same time to exercise control over the validity of changes. Anyone who has 
</p>
<p>tried to notify their bank of their change of address will be aware of the problem. 
</p>
<p>Figure 13.7 shows the steps involved in implementing a data change in a computer 
</p>
<p>system. Data integrity can only be achieved at the expense of a considerable num-
</p>
<p>ber of checks. A data custodian has responsibility for overseeing changes.

</p>
<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to discuss situations where the benefits of 
</p>
<p>some or all of the activities are not measurable in terms of direct financial returns. 
</p>
<p>We then indicate how asset management decisions may be approached in these 
</p>
<p>cases. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will be aware of those areas where 
</p>
<p>benefits are wholly or partly of a nature which is not readily quantifiable in finan-
</p>
<p>cial terms. You will learn about how to approach problems of this type and how to 
</p>
<p>carry out cost&ndash;benefit analysis using a planning balance sheet.
</p>
<p>14.1  Cost&ndash;Benefit Analysis1
</p>
<p>Cost&ndash;benefit analysis is the analysis of projects in which some of the inputs and 
</p>
<p>outputs can be assigned financial values but some cannot. Cost&ndash;benefit analysis is 
</p>
<p>a major factor in asset developments which have social or environmental impacts. 
</p>
<p>The aim here is to present a basic outline of the concepts used in approaching 
</p>
<p>cost&ndash;benefit analysis.
</p>
<p>14.1.1  Nonfinancial Benefits
</p>
<p>Examples of types of project where there are nonfinancial benefits occur exten-
</p>
<p>sively in the provision for community services in areas such as:

</p>
<p>&bull; Safety,

</p>
<p>Other areas where no direct financial benefit is available but investment can still be 
</p>
<p>necessary or worth while are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Value preserving or protecting activities, in that they reduce the probability of, 
</p>
<p>or effects of, deterioration, failure, accidents, faults, fatigue, or delays.
</p>
<p>&bull; Meeting regulatory requirements. This is usually in relation to technical, health, 
</p>
<p>safety, or environmental considerations and may include the identification of, 
</p>
<p>and compliance with, technical regulations or standards.
</p>
<p>&bull; Exploratory or pre-feasibility studies which may or may not lead on to business 
</p>
<p>generating projects, examples; geological evaluation of a prospective mineral 
</p>
<p>area; evaluation of a condition monitoring technique to assess its applicability 
</p>
<p>and effectiveness in a particular application.
</p>
<p>&bull; Improvements in materials handling, access, communication, housekeeping, 
</p>
<p>simplifying operations, layout, or storage.
</p>
<p>&bull; Research with the aim of furthering knowledge, but without a specific, prede-
</p>
<p>fined financial motivation.
</p>
<p>14.2  Cost&ndash;Benefit Analysis Outline
</p>
<p>Cost&ndash;Benefit Analysis involves the evaluation of scenarios where the outcomes 
</p>
<p>involve both financial and nonfinancial benefits and disbenefits. We wish to have 
</p>
<p>an approach to striking a balance between the financially quantifiable and the more 
</p>
<p>subjective aspects of an issue.
</p>
<p>Examples occur particularly in areas involving the environment and in public 
</p>
<p>works. An example is the Brisbane&mdash;Gold Coast freeway, the route of which was 
</p>
<p>changed to protect the habitat of koala bears. Another case is the Mullum Mullum 
</p>
<p>tunnel in Melbourne which was created to avoid disturbing a flora and fauna sen-
</p>
<p>sitive area. The cost of these route choices was significantly higher than the mini-
</p>
<p>mum cost alternative, but was considered acceptable by the general community. 
</p>
<p>With electricity transmission lines there is often public resistance to the creation of 
</p>
<p>new routes, and it is easier to upgrade an existing route than to create a new one. 
</p>
<p>However, almost every project gives rise to protests, but a simple BANANA (Build 
</p>
<p>Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything) approach is not the complete answer.
</p>
<p>14.2.1  A Basic Example
</p>
<p>The problem addressed by cost&ndash;benefit analysis can be characterized by the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing scenario based on options for a road building project. The cost&ndash;benefit 
</p>
<p>analysis here is looked at from a general community perspective. The financial </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>241
</p>
<p>analysis of the project as an investment for a toll road would focus financially on 
</p>
<p>construction cost versus toll income, but may include a contribution from govern-
</p>
<p>ment in recognition of amenity value. The following options, costs benefits and 
</p>
<p>disbenefits exist for the project.
</p>
<p>1. Do not build the road. This is the base case against which the other options are 
</p>
<p>compared.
</p>
<p>Cost Zero
</p>
<p>Benefit Zero
</p>
<p>Disbenefits Traffic congestion and environmental impact on existing roads.
</p>
<p>2. Build a tunnel.
</p>
<p>Cost $2,000,000,000. Toll of $5 per vehicle.
</p>
<p>Benefits Reduced traffic congestion and reduced environmental impact on existing 
</p>
<p>roads. Reduced travel times for vehicles, leading to greater general efficiency of 
</p>
<p>movement and trade.
</p>
<p>Disbenefits Cost to road users.
</p>
<p>3. Build road through parkland.
</p>
<p>Cost $1,000,000,000. Toll of $2.50 per vehicle.
</p>
<p>Benefits Reduced traffic congestion and reduced environmental impact on existing 
</p>
<p>roads. Reduced travel times for vehicles, leading to greater general efficiency of 
</p>
<p>movement and trade.
</p>
<p>Disbenefits Reduced area of parkland for community. Impact on wildlife habitat. 
</p>
<p>Cost to road users, but less than for tunnel.
</p>
<p>4. Route the road through an existing developed area by compulsory purchase of 
</p>
<p>land and properties.
</p>
<p>Costs Road building $500,000,000. Compensation to existing property owners 
</p>
<p>$200,000,000. No toll.
</p>
<p>Benefits Reduced travel times for vehicles, leading to greater general efficiency 
</p>
<p>of movement and trade. Property owners who are compensated can redeploy their 
</p>
<p>part of the cost and this is therefore a financial transfer rather than a sunk cost.
</p>
<p>Disbenefits Impact on developed areas close to route. Traffic congestion still 
</p>
<p>significant.
</p>
<p>The point of cost&ndash;benefit analysis is that there is no purely financial solution, 
</p>
<p>and that a judgment must be made between options that involve some well-defined 
</p>
<p>costs, some less well-defined costs, revenues or transfers, and some subjective 
</p>
<p>benefits and disbenefits.
</p>
<p>14.3  Needs and Wants
</p>
<p>In cost&ndash;benefit analysis it is desirable to recognize a spectrum of desirability 
</p>
<p>which ranges from needs to wants. Thus, a community needs an adequate and 
</p>
<p>healthy water supply, but may also want to preserve swamp land for frogs. This is 
</p>
<p>also an issue of priorities. At a basic level, many people would see that the humans 
</p>
<p>14.2 Cost&ndash;Benefit Analysis Outline</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>242 14 Cost&ndash;Benefit Analysis
</p>
<p>are more important than the frogs, but once human needs are met then preserving 
</p>
<p>the frogs is a worthwhile benefit. Ideally, a balance of expectations must be struck.
</p>
<p>We should aim to increase the combined economic and social benefits to the 
</p>
<p>community as a whole. It helps if we enable members of the community to par-
</p>
<p>ticipate in selection and prioritization of projects, but it is likely that some peo-
</p>
<p>ple will oppose any given outcome. Public education regarding the various options 
</p>
<p>will help to achieve a solution which reflects the balance of community priorities. 
</p>
<p>In a democratic system, if the legal rules are followed, the decisions of the elected 
</p>
<p>government can reasonably override the objections of a few protesters.
</p>
<p>A Value Engineering style of analysis can be useful in refining options 
</p>
<p>in relation to cost&ndash;benefit-based public sector developments and a possible 
</p>
<p>questionnaire is shown in Fig. 14.1.
</p>
<p>14.4  User Pays Principle
</p>
<p>The User Pays principle is that those who use or benefit from a service should pay 
</p>
<p>for it. Cost&ndash;benefit analysis involves variations from this principle, on the grounds 
</p>
<p>that not all the issues are financially tractable, and that wider social benefits need 
</p>
<p>to be considered. Nevertheless, it should be recognized that money represents a 
</p>
<p>broadly based measure of &ldquo;good&rdquo; and a financial approach should not be aban-
</p>
<p>doned too lightly. Anything that can reasonably be costed should be costed. The 
</p>
<p>User Pays principle should be maintained as far as reasonably possible, though 
</p>
<p>Question Comment
</p>
<p>Can all or some of the function be User Pays?
</p>
<p>Is expenditure by the taxpayers or a similar broad non-
</p>
<p>benefitting group justified?
</p>
<p>Can the function be provided within an existing 
</p>
<p>service?
</p>
<p>Can the function replace or reduce an existing one?
</p>
<p>Does the proposal provide an opportunity to rationalize
</p>
<p>related activities?
</p>
<p>Are all the features requested really required?
</p>
<p>Are the requested capacity and availability fully 
</p>
<p>justified?
</p>
<p>Can the function be outsourced?
</p>
<p>Can economies be made in regard to development 
</p>
<p>effort, materials, finishes, energy consumption, 
</p>
<p>maintenance?
</p>

<p>243
</p>
<p>in a cost&ndash;benefit situation this will often mean that the user does not pay the full 
</p>
<p>price. The amount paid by the user acts as a regulator of demand, and also guards 
</p>
<p>against frivolous use or misuse.
</p>
<p>Payment rules should avoid creating situations where an organization has an open-
</p>
<p>ended commitment to provide a service at below cost. Cross-subsidization, that is 
</p>
<p>assets or services being provided for one group but being paid for by another, should 
</p>
<p>be kept to minimal levels. Some acceptance of cross subsidy is, however, likely to be 
</p>
<p>involved in many cost&ndash;benefit cases. The term postage stamp pricing applies to cases 
</p>
<p>where all users pay the same price for a service, even though the cost of delivery varies.
</p>
<p>Some people are likely to have genuine loss of amenity and in this case com-
</p>
<p>pensation will be a reasonable issue. It will be necessary to evaluate the claims of 
</p>
<p>vocal as against nonvocal groups and to deal with the NIMBY or Not In My Back 
</p>
<p>Yard effect.
</p>
<p>14.5  Activity-Based Cost&ndash;Benefit Analysis
</p>
<p>Activity-based costing means relating costs for a product or service closely to 
</p>
<p>the activities needed to support it. This is in contrast to a broad brush approach 
</p>
<p>which allocates overheads in proportion to some simple measure such as direct 
</p>
<p>man-hour content, even when a particular overhead may not apply to a particular 
</p>
<p>activity. Activity-based costing is a way of accurately allocating of overheads to 
</p>
<p>the activities they are used on, and not to others.
</p>
<p>In activity-based costing, we
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify the &ldquo;cost drivers&rdquo; of each activity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Relate costs, and hence budgets and prices for these activities to the drivers.
</p>
<p>Activity-based cost&ndash;benefit analysis (a term which I have just invented) involves 
</p>
<p>identifying the cost and benefit drivers of each activity and using these as a basis 
</p>
<p>for cost&ndash;benefit analysis. The focus of activity-based cost&ndash;benefit analysis is to 
</p>
<p>avoid misallocating costs or benefits to activities to which they do not apply. This 
</p>
<p>applies particularly to overhead or in-direct costs which can often be distributed 
</p>
<p>across activities which do not require them. Equally, it applies to assigning those 
</p>
<p>costs to areas which do require them. An example of an inappropriate cost alloca-
</p>
<p>tion is applying bushfire insurance costs as a charge on all properties, regardless of 
</p>
<p>whether they are in a bushfire prone area or not.
</p>
<p>14.6  Lost Opportunity Cost
</p>
<p>As well as the active options identified in a cost&ndash;benefit study there may be other 
</p>
<p>opportunities which could arise. Thus if a sports center is not built in a certain 
</p>
<p>place, it may be possible to sell the land and use the money for other benefits. It 
</p>
<p>14.4 User Pays Principle</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>244 14 Cost&ndash;Benefit Analysis
</p>
<p>can be argued that this then becomes an option in a normal sense, but it is impor-
</p>
<p>tant to consider lost opportunity aspects of the various scenarios.
</p>
<p>14.7  Measures of Benefit
</p>
<p>Quality-adjusted life-years is a concept used in evaluating the benefit of medical 
</p>
<p>treatments to patients. Other measures correspond to the types of key performance 
</p>
<p>indicators discussed in the section with that title.
</p>
<p>14.8  Cost&ndash;Benefit Analysis Steps
</p>
<p>Cost&ndash;benefit analysis proceeds through the following steps:
</p>
<p> a. State the objectives.
</p>
<p> b. Obtain basic information.
</p>
<p> c. Identify measures to be used in evaluating scenarios.
</p>
<p> d. Select scenarios.
</p>
<p> e. Include a base case scenario relative to which the costs and benefits are 
</p>
<p>calculated. This is usually the &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; scenario.
</p>
<p> f. Identify the stakeholders.
</p>
<p> g. Identify activities or events which impact on each stakeholder.
</p>
<p> h. For each stakeholder and activity identify the costs, benefits, and disbenefits.
</p>
<p> i. Present the result as a Planning Summary Sheet.
</p>
<p> j. Rank scenario options.
</p>
<p> k. Recommend preferred option.
</p>
<p>14.8.1  Activity-Based Cost&ndash;Benefit Summary Sheet
</p>
<p>To illustrate the cost&ndash;benefit process and give an example of a summary sheet, 
</p>
<p>consider the following cost&ndash;benefit example.
</p>
<p>14.8.1.1  Example&mdash;Undergrounding of Electricity Distribution System
</p>
<p>Residents in suburban city are interested in having their overhead electricity 
</p>
<p>distribution system put underground because:
</p>
<p>&bull; The area is prone to occasional severe storms which cause extensive electrical 
</p>
<p>outages;
</p>
<p>&bull; The streets look better without overhead wires (amenity value).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>245
</p>
<p>A study of undergrounding options for the city has been found as follows. Eighty 
</p>
<p>percent of the area is on sandy soil where undergrounding is relatively cheap. 
</p>
<p>The cost of undergrounding this area has been estimated at $3,000,000. The 
</p>
<p>cost of undergrounding the remaining 20 % which is on rocky ground would be 
</p>
<p>$4,000,000 which is considered prohibitive. Undergrounding reduces the fre-
</p>
<p>quency of outages significantly in the area undergrounded, marginally in adjacent 
</p>
<p>areas and slightly in other areas.
</p>
<p>Prepare a cost&ndash;benefit summary sheet for a scenario where the 80 % area is 
</p>
<p>undergrounded with the $3,000,000 cost being met as follows:
</p>
<p>City council $1,000,000
</p>
<p>Electricity company $1,000,000
</p>
<p>State government $1,000,000.
</p>
<p>14.8.1.2  Solution
</p>
<p>The conclusion from the cost&ndash;benefit analysis is that the residents in the under-
</p>
<p>grounded area are the significant benefactors, particularly in regard to amenity. 
</p>
<p>Most of the cost is paid by others, but it is spread quite thinly. The city resi-
</p>
<p>dents were willing to bear their share of the cost for the sake of the amenity 
</p>
<p>value.
</p>
<p>In the example of Table 14.1 only one scenario is shown. There could be other 
</p>
<p>scenarios, for example with less or more of the city undergrounded or with the 
</p>
<p>costs distributed in some other way.
</p>
<p>Also, for each stakeholder there can be multiple activities, to be shown in a 
</p>
<p>separate activities column, each with its own costs and benefits. The Regional 
</p>
<p>Health Clinics exercise gives an example of this.

</p>
<p>14.9  Regional Health Clinics Exercise
</p>
<p>A regional health organization is facing increased demands for services. At pre-
</p>
<p>sent, there are four small clinics in separate locations. Users are asking for reduced 
</p>
<p>waiting times and for a greater range of services. There is local concern that gov-
</p>
<p>ernment may close some clinics in order to save money.
</p>
<p>In fact, government is willing to spend more money but requires a cost&ndash;benefit 
</p>
<p>analysis as an input to planning. Give an outline cost&ndash;benefit analysis in dot point 
</p>
<p>form. Factors include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Large clinics can have more facilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Attendees at clinics include significant numbers of parents with young children.
</p>
<p>Options are:
</p>
<p>1. Retain the four small clinics as they are at the existing locations. This option 
</p>
<p>includes some minor improvements at each site and is the base case.
</p>
<p>2. Create a large central facility and close the other clinics.
</p>
<p>3. Create an intermediate-sized central facility and retain three existing clinics in 
</p>
<p>their present form, with minor improvements.
</p>
<p>A solution in dot point form is in the exercise solutions section.

</p>
<p>The factors in a cost&ndash;benefit analysis may be represented in a spider diagram. 
</p>
<p>Figure 14.2 shows a diagram for the Regional Health Clinics Exercise. Four fac-
</p>
<p>tors are illustrated. More distance from the center represents a good outcome. The 
</p>
<p>upward line represents cost, with lower cost being further from the center. The 
</p>
<p>cheapest option is Option 2 because the income from sale of the unused sites and 
</p>
<p>the economies of scale at a single site more than offset the cost of developing the 
</p>
<p>large site. Option 3 is the most expensive because no sites are sold but there are 
</p>
<p>more development costs than for Option 1. Users travel is the same for Options 1 
</p>
<p>and 3 but higher for Option 2. Option 3 is relatively expensive but has the benefit 
</p>
<p>of an improved service range at the main location without major impact on user 
</p>
<p>travel.

<p>Abstract This chapter introduces the concept of risk, gives references to  
</p>
<p>standards and major documents which deal with risk, and defines terms relating 
</p>
<p>to risk. The procedures in the management of risk are then outlined and the leg-
</p>
<p>islative approach to risk is discussed and illustrated by an example. Various types 
</p>
<p>of risk are described, and hazard analysis and the assessment of consequences 
</p>
<p>are discussed. Factors in mitigating risk and contingency planning are presented. 
</p>
<p>The chapter concludes with an example of risk analysis and management in a 
</p>
<p>water supply system. Risk considerations in safety critical plant are addressed 
</p>
<p>in the separate chapter under the title of &ldquo;Safety.&rdquo; Outcomes After reading this 
</p>
<p>chapter you will know how to analyze and treat risk. This will include an aware-
</p>
<p>ness of the legal approach based on meeting duty of care and regulatory obliga-
</p>
<p>tions, and the analysis and assessment of risk in relation to projects and to plant 
</p>
<p>and machinery. You will be aware of techniques of hazard analysis, the assess-
</p>
<p>ment of consequences, the use of contingency allowances, and of methods of 
</p>
<p>mitigating risk. You will have seen how risk analysis was used in a water supply 
</p>
<p>system application.

<p>250 15 Risk Analysis and Risk Management
</p>
<p>15.1  Aim
</p>
<p>The aim of risk analysis and risk management is to address four fundamental 
</p>
<p>questions:
</p>
<p>&bull; What can go wrong?
</p>
<p>&bull; How likely is this to happen?
</p>
<p>&bull; What are the consequences if it does?
</p>
<p>&bull; How can the likelihood and consequences be reduced or mitigated?
</p>
<p>Risk is a very broadly based concept, and one whose range has expanded in recent 
</p>
<p>times to cover everything except a racing certainty. There is a strong emphasis on 
</p>
<p>risk in the ISO 55000 Asset Management standards.1

<p>the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
</p>
<p>15.3  Risk Analysis
</p>
<p>Risk analysis is concerned with identifying risks and assessing potential likeli-
</p>
<p>hood and consequences. Events can have favorable as well as unfavorable conse-
</p>
<p>quences, for example, a construction project may encounter good or bad weather. 
</p>
<p>Risk analysis should assist us to avoid adverse effects, and to be prepared to deal 
</p>
<p>with them if and when they do occur. Risk assessment involves a willingness to 
</p>
<p>consider possibilities which we would rather not consider.
</p>
<p>Over zealous commitment to a project and the wide engagement of senior per-
</p>
<p>sonnel and high-level stakeholders make it harder to admit and avoid risk. Had the 
</p>
<p>voyage of the Titanic not been such a high-profile event, it is most probable that 
</p>
<p>the ship&rsquo;s captain would have slowed down and not hit an iceberg at fatal speed.
</p>
<p>15.4  Definitions
</p>
<p>ISO Guide 73 defines a range of terms relating to risk. The following are key terms:
</p>
<p>Risk the chance of something happening (an event) that will have an impact on 
</p>
<p>objectives.
</p>
<p>Hazard a source of potential harm.
</p>
<p>Consequence the outcome of an event in the form of loss, gain, disadvantage, 
</p>
<p>advantage, or injury.
</p>
<p>Likelihood a qualitative description of probability or frequency of occurrence of 
</p>
<p>an event.
</p>
<p>15.5  Management of Risk
</p>
<p>Risk management involves recognizing risk and taking steps as may be necessary 
</p>
<p>to reduce the potential effects. This involves the creation of roles, responsibilities, 
</p>
<p>and authorities in relation to risk.
</p>

<p>252 15 Risk Analysis and Risk Management
</p>
<p>In practice, this means that a hazard analysis is undertaken in which we make a 
</p>
<p>list of the risks, known as a risk register. We then analyze the risks, considering their 
</p>
<p>significance and how they may be overcome or mitigated. We then create the neces-
</p>
<p>sary controls, procedures, and contingency plans. A general outline of the procedure 
</p>
<p>is shown in Fig. 15.1, which is based on diagrams in the standards previously cited.
</p>
<p>In setting roles, responsibilities, and authorities, the general principle is that 
</p>
<p>managers with budgetary authority over an area have responsibilities for risk in 
</p>
<p>that area. This is because budgetary authority is required in order to take the steps 
</p>
<p>necessary to address any risk issue.
</p>
<p>Specialist advice is also likely to be required in relation to technical functions 
</p>
<p>and specific hazards. For this purpose, we may create a company-wide risk assess-
</p>
<p>ment team which specializes in understanding the types of risk that occur in the 
</p>
<p>business. This can be a task of the asset management group, or the relevant asset 
</p>
<p>manager, but it is also important to engage local operations personnel. Specific 
</p>
<p>equipment specialists, legal liability specialists, and health, safety, and environ-
</p>
<p>mental specialists may be involved as necessary. The risk assessment team advises 
</p>
<p>on the analysis of risk, risk mitigation activity, and contingency plans and recom-
</p>
<p>mends funding support to the regular budgetary authority, such as a plant manager.
</p>
<p>15.5.1  Risk Management Documents
</p>
<p>To manage risk, appropriate documentation is required. Key documents are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk Management Policy Statement;
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk Register showing identified risks and risk ratings;
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk Treatment Schedule and Plan; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk Action Plan.

<p>15.6  Take 52
</p>
<p>Take 5 is technique aimed at encouraging the widespread adoption of risk man-
</p>
<p>agement, by summarizing the process in a simple form. In the Take 5 process, the 
</p>
<p>individual reviews the job, the workplace, the system of work, and the work environ-
</p>
<p>ment immediately prior to starting a task. The individual is responsible for the deci-
</p>
<p>sion to proceed with the task or not, based on the Take 5 process outcomes. If it is 
</p>
<p>unsafe, the task must not be started. Figure 15.2 shows the step by step process.
</p>
<p>15.7  Legislative Approach
</p>
<p>The legal approach to risk centers on meeting the requirements of existing legisla-
</p>
<p>tion, existing standards or, in the absence of these, of good practice. It is important 
</p>
<p>to be aware of legislation and related standards which apply to your activities, and 
</p>
<p>to comply with these. The documents listed earlier in this chapter form a useful 
</p>
<p>starting point, and some other relevant standards are listed in the Standards section 
</p>
<p>at the end of this book.
</p>
<p>A duty of care exists (under Common Law) where there is a foreseeable and 
</p>
<p>predictable cause and a hazardous effect and where it is practicable to remove the 
</p>
<p>cause or control the effect. If a zoo keeps a tiger, it is up to the zoo to ensure 
</p>
<p>that the tiger does not get out and kill someone. Conforming to an appropriate 
</p>
<p>regulation can provide a legal defense in a prosecution for breach of an obliga-
</p>
<p>tion. Where there is no defined regulation, you must be able to show that you took

<p>reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence in managing exposure to risk. 
</p>
<p>If the procedures associated with the precautions are not documented, then they do 
</p>
<p>not exist!
</p>
<p>Maintenance specified by a manufacturer must be carried out unless a convinc-
</p>
<p>ing reason otherwise can be presented. The maintenance that is carried out must 
</p>
<p>be recorded. Regulations applying to the design or operation of equipment must 
</p>
<p>be complied with, and good practice must be followed in regard to issues such 
</p>
<p>as operation and supervision by competent persons. This will often extend to the 
</p>
<p>assessment of equipment condition by technically qualified staff.
</p>
<p>Figure 15.3 illustrates the issue of satisfying a duty of care in an application 
</p>
<p>involving an electricity cable. A contractor digs up and severs the cable causing 
</p>
<p>damage and disruption to businesses. The contractor argues that the electricity 
</p>
<p>company which owns the cable has failed in its duty of care. The duty of care of 
</p>
<p>the electricity company covers four regulated features;
</p>
<p>&bull; marking the position of the cable;
</p>
<p>&bull; placing it at the correct depth;
</p>
<p>&bull; aligning it correctly in relation to nearby buildings; and
</p>
<p>&bull; providing protection in physical and electrical terms (e.g., circuit breakers).

</p>
<p>If the electricity company has carried out these duties correctly, it will have a pre-
</p>
<p>sentable defense against the contractor&rsquo;s arguments.
</p>
<p>15.8  Types of Risk
</p>
<p>15.8.1  Sovereign Risk
</p>
<p>Sovereign risk is risk associated with high-level events outside your organizational 
</p>
<p>control, particularly those involving government actions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Government changes the law, the regulatory rules, or the level of subsidies after 
</p>
<p>you have invested;
</p>
<p>&bull; Political change of sentiment;
</p>
<p>&bull; War and peace.
</p>
<p>Sovereign risk may be offset by force majeure clauses in a contract which specify 
</p>
<p>that certain risks are excluded from the contractor&rsquo;s liability.
</p>
<p>15.8.2  Solution Risk
</p>
<p>Solution risk is where the expected solution to a problem, or the technology under-
</p>
<p>lying a project, turns out not to work or to be prohibitively expensive. Solution 
</p>
<p>risk is easy to overlook or underestimate. Many major losses have occurred 
</p>
<p>because the wrong solution was selected for a development. Project managers 
</p>
<p>should be aware of this issue and avoid excessive commitment to a solution which 
</p>
<p>is in fact unproven. If in doubt, undertake a pilot study or do more research.
</p>
<p>15.8.3  Technical Development Risk
</p>
<p>Development work is notoriously risky. Assumed technical progress is often not 
</p>
<p>realized. Projects involving software, combining software and hardware, or inte-
</p>
<p>grating of two or more systems are particularly difficult. It is advisable to regard 
</p>
<p>development strictly as development, and not to jump into a production phase 
</p>
<p>before a concept is proven.
</p>
<p>15.7 Legislative Approach</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>256 15 Risk Analysis and Risk Management
</p>
<p>15.8.4  Performance Risk
</p>
<p>The performance resulting from development may prove to be unsatisfactory. 
</p>
<p>Production or support aspects of a development may prove unsatisfactory, or new 
</p>
<p>developments may overtake the original concept.
</p>
<p>15.8.5  Commercial or Financial Risk
</p>
<p>Sales may not be realized&mdash;fewer buyers or users may appear than forecast. The 
</p>
<p>profit margin will then be eroded by lack of sales. Competition is another factor 
</p>
<p>that can depress sales. Costs may be higher than forecast, leading to an eroded 
</p>
<p>profit margin. Anticipated capital funds may not become available.
</p>
<p>15.8.6  Administrative Risk
</p>
<p>Risks can arise from events inside your organization but outside your project. 
</p>
<p>Other departments do not commit; there are delays in or lack of approvals, and 
</p>
<p>delays in, or nondelivery of, related activities needed for your project. A rendez-
</p>
<p>vous is a weakness in a plan.
</p>
<p>15.8.7  Safety and Environmental
</p>
<p>Safety and environmental impact are often risk factors. Extensive legislation and 
</p>
<p>procedures relating safety and environmental protection are normally specified for 
</p>
<p>any hazardous industry or occupation and the relevant rules must be identified and 
</p>
<p>followed. Safety is discussed further in the chapter with that title.
</p>
<p>15.8.8  Supplier Risk
</p>
<p>A supplier may fail to deliver, or there may be delay in delivery. There may be 
</p>
<p>changes to pricing or level of support.
</p>
<p>15.8.9  Resources
</p>
<p>Physical facilities or human resources in design, development, acquisition, produc-
</p>
<p>tion, operations, or sales may fail to eventuate.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>257
</p>
<p>15.9  Hazard Analysis
</p>
<p>Hazard analysis means considering all the things that might go wrong and making 
</p>
<p>a list of them. This is a basic step in addressing risk. Hazard analysis should be 
</p>
<p>carried out by persons with a thorough knowledge of the plant or service charac-
</p>
<p>teristics and methods of operation&mdash;steady-state and transient. Formal processes 
</p>
<p>have been developed and extensively documented to assist with hazard analy-
</p>
<p>sis, including the following. References are given in the references section at the 
</p>
<p>beginning of this chapter.
</p>
<p>&bull; Hazard Identification (HAZID)
</p>
<p>&bull; Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP)
</p>
<p>&bull; Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk-Based Inspection (RBI).
</p>
<p>15.10  Consequences
</p>
<p>A consequence is the result of an adverse event occurring. Consequences associ-
</p>
<p>ated with risk include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; loss of business, at minor or major level;
</p>
<p>&bull; legal liability and costs;
</p>
<p>&bull; loss of reputation;
</p>
<p>&bull; lost production;
</p>
<p>&bull; project failure;
</p>
<p>&bull; project delays or additional costs;
</p>
<p>&bull; emergency service costs;
</p>
<p>&bull; repair costs;
</p>
<p>&bull; secondary damage;
</p>
<p>&bull; adverse environmental impact;
</p>
<p>&bull; injury; and 
</p>
<p>&bull; loss of life.

<p>Risk analysis is an assessment of the seriousness of the risks that we have identi-
</p>
<p>fied. As part of the analysis, we consider any existing controls that may be applied 
</p>
<p>and the effectiveness of those controls.
</p>
<p>15.9 Hazard Analysis</p>

<p>258 15 Risk Analysis and Risk Management
</p>
<p>At its simplest, risk analysis may be done by a direct judgment approach in 
</p>
<p>which we rate and rank the risks. We then proceed to consider how we might 
</p>
<p>reduce or mitigate those risks that we have judged to be sufficiently serious to 
</p>
<p>warrant attention.
</p>
<p>A more structured approach is to apply qualitative scales to assess the likeli-
</p>
<p>hood of each risk the consequences if it occurs. The likelihoods and consequences 
</p>
<p>are then combined to determine a risk rating. Table 15.1 Risk Level Matrix, shows 
</p>
<p>the approach. This is based on the type of risk matrix in IEC 30010.
</p>
<p>15.11.1  Risk Matrix
</p>
<p>In Table 15.1 the following qualitative ratings are used. An alternative is to use 
</p>
<p>1&ndash;5 numeric ratings.
</p>
<p>&bull; Likelihood Rare, Unlikely, Moderate, Likely, and Almost Certain
</p>
<p>&bull; Consequence Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, and Severe
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk Rating Low, Medium, High, and Extreme.
</p>

<p>Likely Medium Medium Medium High Extreme

<p>Moderate Low Medium Medium High High
</p>
<p>Unlikely Low Low Medium Medium High
</p>
<p>Rare Low Low Low Medium Medium</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>259
</p>
<p>We may then specify that the various levels of risk call for action to be taken 
</p>
<p>at suitable levels of management and within suitable time scales, such as the 
</p>
<p>following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Extreme Immediate executive action is required
</p>
<p>&bull; High Executive action is required
</p>
<p>&bull; Medium Management assignment of action and responsibilities is required
</p>
<p>&bull; Low Manage using routine processes.
</p>
<p>15.11.2  Consequence Ratings
</p>
<p>In manufacturing applications, the consequence rating options might take the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing form:
</p>
<p>Consequence ratings
</p>
<p>&bull; Insignificant,
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer complaint,
</p>
<p>&bull; Product recall,
</p>
<p>&bull; Serious illness/injury,
</p>
<p>&bull; Fatality.
</p>
<p>15.12  Risk Register
</p>
<p>Each identified risk should be entered into a risk register. The format may vary 
</p>
<p>with the various techniques. For each risk identified, a risk register records such 
</p>
<p>factors as:
</p>
<p>&bull; source;
</p>
<p>&bull; nature;
</p>
<p>&bull; existing controls;
</p>
<p>&bull; likelihood and consequences;
</p>
<p>&bull; initial rating; and
</p>
<p>&bull; vulnerability to change.
</p>
<p>15.13  Mitigating Risk
</p>
<p>The primary reason for considering risk is in order to avoid undesirable conse-
</p>
<p>quences. This means that we need to take steps to eliminate, mitigate, or reduce 
</p>
<p>risk.
</p>
<p>15.11 Risk Analysis and Risk Rating</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>260 15 Risk Analysis and Risk Management
</p>
<p>It is often not possible to eliminate risk entirely, and in this case the aim will 
</p>
<p>be to substantially reduce risk. One approach to this is described as reducing risk 
</p>
<p>to a level which is As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). An alternative 
</p>
<p>terminology is that risks should be reduced So Far As is Reasonably Practical 
</p>
<p>(SFAIRP). There is debate about how different these approaches are. ALARP may 
</p>
<p>be said to imply some form of numerical estimation of the remaining risk. SFAIRP 
</p>
<p>is described as &ldquo;precautionary,&rdquo; meaning that evident precautions should be taken, 
</p>
<p>without implying that numerical estimation is involved. The precautionary or 
</p>
<p>SFAIRP approach appears to carry more legal weight.
</p>
<p>At the general business level, some techniques which we may use to reduce risk 
</p>
<p>are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk identification to create awareness and good practice.
</p>
<p>&bull; Creating and implementing plans to reduce risk.
</p>
<p>&bull; Adopting safety precautions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Contingency planning.
</p>
<p>&bull; Contract terms to limit business risk.
</p>
<p>&bull; Using the skills of a group of experts to assess risk and mitigate risk.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use skills of experienced estimators and managers in creating and managing 
</p>
<p>projects.
</p>
<p>&bull; Record and apply corporate knowledge of previous risks.
</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section, we provide a brief resume of more technical tech-
</p>
<p>niques in the risk mitigation area, but note that it is important in practice to be 
</p>
<p>aware of and follow the detailed techniques relevant to the actual situation of any 
</p>
<p>particular industry or service.
</p>
<p>15.14  Contingency Planning3
</p>
<p>Contingency planning is making plans to be brought into effect if adverse condi-
</p>
<p>tions eventuate.
</p>
<p>15.14.1  Contingency Allowance
</p>
<p>Contingency allowances are a common way of allowing for risk in projects. 
</p>
<p>Typically, 10&ndash;20 % contingency funds will be allowed in project budgets. The 
</p>
<p>level depends on an assessment of the risks. Contingency allowances are best held 
</p>
<p>on a central basis, as this allows for flexibility. However, the existence of contin-
</p>
<p>gency allowances should not be taken as a substitute for good management.
</p>
<p>3 ISO 55001 Clause 6.2.2: &ldquo;The organization shall ensure that&hellip;risks are considered&hellip;including 
contingency planning.&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>261
</p>
<p>15.14.2  Contingency Plan
</p>
<p>An example from a contingency plan is shown in Fig. 15.5, which shows the loca-
</p>
<p>tions to be adopted by crew members of a passenger ferry in the event of various 
</p>
<p>types of emergency. Further detailed procedures for different circumstances would 
</p>
<p>form part of the contingency plan.
</p>
<p>15.14.3  Retirement of Risk
</p>
<p>When a risk is no longer relevant, it should be retired from the analysis and any cor-
</p>
<p>responding contingency allowance should then be discontinued. An issue that arises is 
</p>
<p>whether, as contingency funds are retired, they should be applied to increasing capability 
</p>
<p>within the same project or should be returned to higher levels for reallocation. In princi-
</p>
<p>ple, return to higher level is the norm, but project managers often put forward strong and 
</p>
<p>successful cases for using retired contingency to enhance their particular project.
</p>
<p>15.15  Quantitative Risk Analysis
</p>
<p>Quantitative risk analysis works in terms of a definition of risk as a probability.

<p>262 15 Risk Analysis and Risk Management
</p>
<p>Concepts in a quantitative approach are,
</p>
<p>&bull; Probability of occurrence The probability that an event occurs in some defined 
</p>
<p>period or situation of risk.
</p>
<p>&bull; Occurrence Rate The average number of times an event occurs per year, or 
</p>
<p>other time interval.
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk-cost The probability that an adverse event occurs multiplied by the cost if 
</p>
<p>it does.
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk-cost per year The occurrence rate of events per year &times; $ cost per event.
</p>
<p>Techniques for estimating risk-cost include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; statistical analysis of failure and successful performance data
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;gut feel&rdquo; based on experience and judgment
</p>
<p>&bull; use of event trees, or simulation.
</p>
<p>Although risk-cost can be a guide to our thinking, the product of a very low occur-
</p>
<p>rence rate multiplied by a very high cost does not always result in a meaningful 
</p>
<p>number when related to conventional financial analysis.
</p>
<p>The risk-cost of business liabilities can be difficult to assess. It is desirable to 
</p>
<p>get senior management to make an assessment of potential risks and costs, as mid-
</p>
<p>dle management can waste time and resources on excessively detailed studies, 
</p>
<p>when a decision, say to replace or retain a certain group of old equipment, may be 
</p>
<p>quickly made by a senior manager with a more overall view of the situation.
</p>
<p>15.16  Other Methods4
</p>
<p>Other methods of risk analysis involve a more analytical or detailed level of 
</p>
<p>approach. These include:
</p>
<p>a. Analysis of reliability and maintenance data.
</p>
<p>b. Use scaling systems for factors such as event probability, severity, and detect-
</p>
<p>ability as in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA).
</p>
<p>c. Application of hazard indices, see for example, Lees&rsquo; op cit, Volume 1, Chap. 8.
</p>
<p>d. Analysis of wear rates based on materials and operational temperatures and 
</p>
<p>pressures, as applied in Risk-Based Inspection.
</p>
<p>e. Test and evaluation procedures, for example in estimating fatigue life or corro-
</p>
<p>sion or degradation rates under specified conditions.
</p>
<p>f. Event trees.
</p>
<p>g. Fault trees analysis, described, for example, by J.P. Bentley, &ldquo;Quality and 
</p>
<p>Reliability Engineering&rdquo;, Longman.
</p>
<p>h. Sensitivity analysis for various scenarios: Optimistic, Best Estimate, and 
</p>
<p>Pessimistic.
</p>
<p>4 An extensive list of risk analysis techniques is given in IEC 31010.</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>i. Risk adjusted discount factor. The discount factor is increased to penalize risky 
</p>
<p>investments.
</p>
<p>j. Simulation modeling including reliability block diagrams.
</p>
<p>15.17  Project Risk Examples
</p>
<p>These are some examples of risks in acquisition projects.
</p>
<p>Machinery is being purchased from an overseas supplier whose technical docu-
</p>
<p>mentation, operating procedures, and training manuals are in another language. A 
</p>
<p>local contractor has been engaged to provide translation of the documentation, and 
</p>
<p>adaptation to local technical and environmental standards. The possibility that the 
</p>
<p>local contractor has bitten off more than he can chew constitutes a risk in the over-
</p>
<p>all acquisition and deployment.
</p>
<p>A number of complex machines are being made to order. Demand on the manu-
</p>
<p>facturer for products generally is rising, and there is a risk that our production will 
</p>
<p>be delayed. Although this will give rise to cost penalties, the negative impact on 
</p>
<p>our company may be significant.
</p>
<p>Equipment may fail acceptance requirements. This is always a possibility, 
</p>
<p>but the position will become clearer from early results and supplier responses to 
</p>
<p>problems.
</p>
<p>15.18  Water Supply System Example
</p>
<p>The following example, relates to the assessment of risk in a water supply system. 
</p>
<p>The system involves pumping water from a river to supply an irrigation system 
</p>
<p>and a town. A flowchart of the system is shown in Fig. 15.6. The heavy arrows 
</p>
<p>indicate water flows.
</p>
<p>The hazards were identified using the system flowchart and fault trees. The 
</p>
<p>flowchart identified each component of the system, e.g., pumps, rising main, pipes, 
</p>
<p>valves, channels, power supply, switchboard, control system, and communication 
</p>
<p>system.
</p>
<p>Fault trees were then used to identify possible faults in each component. 
</p>
<p>Figure 15.7 shows an example.
</p>
<p>For each possible fault, risk assessments were then made. The results were 
</p>
<p>recorded on forms using the concepts suggested in the risk standards, although the 
</p>
<p>actual form layouts were specific to the application. Examples of completed forms 
</p>
<p>are shown in Fig. 15.8.

<p>15.18.1  Hazard Analysis
</p>
<p>In this application, the fault or hazard rate assessments were based qualitatively on 
</p>
<p>the scale shown in Fig. 15.9. The scale was refined by allowing noninteger values 
</p>
<p>in the range 0&ndash;1 to reflect varying degrees of likelihood of rare events.
</p>
<p>The nature of the risks was assessed under the headings:
</p>
<p>&bull; Safety,
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost,
</p>
<p>&bull; Function,
</p>
<p>&bull; Environment.
</p>
<p>The consequences were assessed on the same 1&ndash;5 scale as Fig. 15.8, giving a risk 
</p>
<p>rating under each heading. A risk rating was then calculated for each potential 
</p>
<p>fault using the formula:
</p>
<p>For example at Ref. 3 of the Risk Register in Fig. 15.9, the following hazard anal-
</p>
<p>ysis is shown:
</p>
<p>1. Hazard is &ldquo;Unable to Supply Water Due to Pump Failure&rdquo;
</p>
<p>2. Hazard Rate: 3 = Medium
</p>
<p>3. Consequences:
</p>
<p>a. Safety: 1 = Very Low
</p>
<p>b. Cost: 4 = High
</p>
<p>c. Function: 5 = Very High
</p>
<p>d. Environment: 1 = Low
</p>
<p>The highest score (worst case) is a rating of 100.
</p>
<p>Mitigation for this hazard (pump failure) was to have a trailer-mounted standby 
</p>
<p>pump available to cover a number of locations and applications.
</p>
<p>15.18.2  Risk Treatment
</p>
<p>Examples of a risk treatment analysis and risk treatment plans are shown in the 
</p>
<p>second and third parts of Fig. 15.9. The example focuses on the risks associated 
</p>
<p>with failure of the control switchboard of the water supply system. This is the haz-
</p>
<p>ard listed at Ref. 7 in the risk register on the first page of Fig. 15.9. In this study, 
</p>
<p>the risk of loss of the switchboard, due to a fire, flood, or cyclone, for example, 
</p>
<p>was considered significant, and a risk treatment analysis was developed.
</p>
<p>Risk Rating = Hazard Rate &lowast; (Safety + Cost + Function + Environment.)
</p>
<p>Risk Rating = HazardRate &lowast; (Safety + Cost + Function + Environment)
</p>
<p>= 3 &lowast; (1 + 4 + 5 + 1) = 33

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to outline the main things to be considered by 
</p>
<p>management in regard to outsourcing of asset management and maintenance work. 
</p>
<p>Both positive and negative aspects of outsourcing are indicated, with the aim of 
</p>
<p>helping managers to get the best value from their outsourcing options. Outcomes 
</p>
<p>After reading this chapter you will know what type of tasks to outsource and what 
</p>
<p>types are best kept in-house. You will learn about the types of outsourcing contract 
</p>
<p>and about the points to watch for in creating and management of outsourcing con-
</p>
<p>tracts. You will also read about outsourcing from a contractor viewpoint, which 
</p>
<p>will assist both parties to an outsourcing contract to achieve a favorable outcome. 
</p>
<p>You will also read about forms of contract such as Build Own Operate Transfer 
</p>
<p>and Public Private Partnerships.
</p>
<p>16.1  Introduction1
</p>
<p>Civilization is based on specialization and specialization involves the devolution 
</p>
<p>of work to those who specialize in specific types of task. Specialization enables an 
</p>
<p>individual or an organization to be equipped, trained, skilled, and experienced in a 
</p>
<p>chosen range of tasks, and potentially to execute those tasks efficiently and rela-
</p>
<p>tively cheaply. This is the rationale for outsourcing. At the same time, outsourcing 
</p>
<p>introduces communication, negotiation, and pricing activities which must be set 
</p>
<p>against the advantages of specialization.
</p>
<p>Outsourcing of maintenance activities from utilities and large-scale enterprises 
</p>
<p>has occurred on a substantial scale in recent years. To some extent this is a politi-
</p>
<p>cal issue, since large-scale enterprises suit the bargaining power of labor organiza-
</p>
<p>tions. However, our concern here is with the practicalities rather than the politics 
</p>
<p>of outsourcing.
</p>

 processes and activities are controlled.&rdquo;

<p>272 16 Outsourcing
</p>
<p>16.2  What to Outsource
</p>
<p>The basic reason for outsourcing work is that it provides a cheaper and/or better 
</p>
<p>service than if we try to do the work ourselves. Besides cost, it may also be sim-
</p>
<p>ply impractical for us to cover all the supporting activities needed by our business 
</p>
<p>on an in-house basis. However, we need to be sure that there is a real cost saving, 
</p>
<p>that it does not lead to a loss of quality, and that it does not come at an ultimately 
</p>
<p>greater cost to our business.
</p>
<p>16.2.1  Noncore Activities
</p>
<p>The activities required to provide a capability can be divided into core and non-
</p>
<p>core activities. For example, in running a power station, the operation of the power 
</p>
<p>plant itself and of the immediate engineering support can be regarded as core, 
</p>
<p>whereas site activities such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; gardening
</p>
<p>&bull; cleaning
</p>
<p>&bull; security
</p>
<p>are noncore. Noncore activities are ready candidates for outsourcing to organiza-
</p>
<p>tions which specialize in the relevant functions, and which are likely to take on 
</p>
<p>similar contracts with a range of organizations whose core businesses can vary 
</p>
<p>widely.
</p>
<p>16.2.2  Minor Player
</p>
<p>Outsourcing also makes good sense for technical activities where our organization 
</p>
<p>is a relatively minor player. Examples can include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electric motor repairs
</p>
<p>&bull; Oil condition analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning maintenance
</p>
<p>16.2.3  Peak Load Resources
</p>
<p>Another common area for the use of contract resources is in the meeting of peaks 
</p>
<p>in activity, such as maintenance personnel required for shutdown work.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>273
</p>
<p>16.3  The Owner/Operator Model
</p>
<p>Another scenario is for an asset owner to appoint an operator who runs the entire 
</p>
<p>operation. For example, a government entity may own a railway, but contract the 
</p>
<p>operation of the railway to an operating company. We often find a multiple level 
</p>
<p>structure in which the operator then subcontracts some functions to more special-
</p>
<p>ized organizations. The general principle here is that a prime contractor should be 
</p>
<p>responsible for his subcontractors. In what follows we refer to the owner or prime 
</p>
<p>operator as an &ldquo;outsourcer&rdquo; and the organizations which are contracted to under-
</p>
<p>take particular types of task as &ldquo;contractors&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>16.4  What NOT to Outsource
</p>
<p>16.4.1  Core Activities
</p>
<p>It is best not to outsource activities which are central to the business, or where the 
</p>
<p>business has more specialist knowledge than the potential contractor. It is important 
</p>
<p>to ensure that the potential contractor knows the business for which they are bidding.
</p>
<p>16.4.2  High Customer Impact
</p>
<p>Another area where companies should be cautious about outsourcing is for func-
</p>
<p>tions with high-customer impact. It is best to keep a close watch on these activ-
</p>
<p>ities and to be able to pick up feedback and respond effectively and quickly to 
</p>
<p>problems.
</p>
<p>16.4.3  Problem Areas
</p>
<p>It is best not to outsource activities which are currently causing a problem. Solve 
</p>
<p>the problem in-house and then consider outsourcing once a satisfactory working 
</p>
<p>solution has been found. Alternatively, if this is not possible, outsource the prob-
</p>
<p>lem-solving activity on its own and then consider your position once a proven 
</p>
<p>solution has been found.
</p>
<p>16.4.4  Examples
</p>
<p>A paper manufacturer outsourced the maintenance of its overhead cranes to 
</p>
<p>a maintenance organization. But it turned out that the contractor, although 
</p>
<p>16.3 The Owner/Operator Model</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>274 16 Outsourcing
</p>
<p>competent in maintaining mobile and construction cranes, had no experience in 
</p>
<p>factory overhead cranes of the type used by the paper manufacturer and did not 
</p>
<p>understand the necessity of maintaining strict alignment of the running rails, 
</p>
<p>nor were they equipped to do this. After a couple of near accidents the company 
</p>
<p>brought the maintenance of the overhead cranes back in-house.
</p>
<p>In another example, a large insurance company was alarmed to find that only 
</p>
<p>two people had a full understanding of the workings of their computer systems, 
</p>
<p>and that both were contractors. They subsequently developed in-house skills and a 
</p>
<p>succession plan.
</p>
<p>16.5  Benefits of Outsourcing
</p>
<p>16.5.1  Concentration on Core Business
</p>
<p>Concentration on core business tends to benefit an organization, giving greater 
</p>
<p>focus to essential activities and resulting in fewer direct employees, less fringe 
</p>
<p>activities, and fewer birthdays to celebrate.
</p>
<p>16.5.2  Redress Workforce Imbalances
</p>
<p>Outsourcing can provide an opportunity to redress imbalances in the workforce. 
</p>
<p>Organizations may have taken on workers in the past whose numbers, skills, 
</p>
<p>and flexibilities are out of step with current requirements. Outsourcing provides 
</p>
<p>an opportunity to review the workforce position from a zero base. Subsequently, 
</p>
<p>it provides greater flexibility in meeting the needs of a changing business 
</p>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p>From the workers point of view, outsourcing can mean the loss of jobs. But 
</p>
<p>many workers benefit from pursuing new lines of activity, and some find employ-
</p>
<p>ment related to their original tasks, but on a basis that, given the increased flex-
</p>
<p>ibility involved, provides benefits for them as well as for their original employers.
</p>
<p>16.5.3  Reduce Fixed Costs
</p>
<p>Outsourcing can also have the benefit of moving fixed costs into variable costs. 
</p>
<p>For example, maintenance and support equipment, is now provided by the contrac-
</p>
<p>tor as an operating expense to the outsourcer. Keeping this equipment up-to-date 
</p>
<p>is now an issue for the contractor, but as this is part of the contractor&rsquo;s main busi-
</p>
<p>ness, it is likely to be well managed and give economies of scale.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>275
</p>
<p>16.5.4  Review Maintenance Practices and Resources
</p>
<p>In the maintenance area, outsourcing provides an opportunity to review and update 
</p>
<p>maintenance practices. Formalizing a contract can create a clearer definition tasks 
</p>
<p>and responsibilities. The contractor, who is likely to have responsibilities across a 
</p>
<p>range of plant, can bring in economies of scale across the maintenance function. 
</p>
<p>Paradoxically, an asset manager can sometimes find it easier to get good perfor-
</p>
<p>mance from a contractor, whose tasks are well defined and whose performance is 
</p>
<p>under routine scrutiny, than it is to get the same performance from an in-house 
</p>
<p>group.
</p>
<p>16.6  Costs of Outsourcing
</p>
<p>16.6.1  Formalization
</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for establishing companies in the first place is to form 
</p>
<p>a team with a collective aim and identity. Within the team, all are working for 
</p>
<p>the same main ends. Cooperation between members of the team is the norm and 
</p>
<p>requires minimal formalities. By contrast, outsourcing means that work is assigned 
</p>
<p>to an outside organization and this means a contractual relationship which requires 
</p>
<p>formalization to cover such things as:
</p>
<p>&bull; work scoping and specification
</p>
<p>&bull; costing
</p>
<p>&bull; identification of potential contractors
</p>
<p>&bull; tendering process
</p>
<p>&bull; selection process
</p>
<p>&bull; contract negotiation and agreement
</p>
<p>&bull; formal legalities
</p>
<p>&bull; contract management, including variations and cost control
</p>
<p>&bull; progress management and on-site activity control
</p>
<p>&bull; auditing of contractor performance.
</p>
<p>This introduces cost elements which were not there when the work was done 
</p>
<p>in-house.
</p>
<p>16.6.2  Intangible Effects
</p>
<p>Outsourcing can also have impacts of a less tangible nature. One such aspect is 
</p>
<p>the loss of ability to direct workers, who now work for the contractor. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, the manager of a hydroelectric generating utility, which operates a number of 
</p>

<p>in a loss of time and flexibility and an increased likelihood that the person dis-
</p>
<p>patched will be unable to solve the problem.
</p>
<p>16.6.3  Other Potential Negatives
</p>
<p>Other negatives can include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Loss of critical skills and technical knowledge which go to the contractor and 
</p>
<p>then to competitors
</p>
<p>&bull; Loss of employees that you did not intend to lose
</p>
<p>&bull; Loss of internal communication
</p>
<p>&bull; Less opportunity for knowledge growth and development of internal expertise
</p>
<p>&bull; Loss of links with suppliers&mdash;suppliers are now dealing with the contractor
</p>
<p>&bull; Hidden costs emerge&mdash;things that you did not realize your employees were 
</p>
<p>doing
</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor looks good initially, but then shifts the best people to the latest 
</p>
<p>client
</p>
<p>&bull; Delays in resolving crises, response time factors
</p>
<p>&bull; Lack of availability of particular necessary skills
</p>
<p>&bull; Loss of direct control over work timing
</p>
<p>&bull; Loss of direct control over work standards
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost of monitoring work done
</p>
<p>&bull; Inhibits continuous improvement
</p>
<p>&bull; Lack of commitment by contract personnel
</p>
<p>&bull; Lack of responsibility by contract personnel who will disappear and not be 
</p>
<p>answerable for problems
</p>
<p>&bull; Potential for conflict between in-house and contract workers
</p>
<p>&bull; Security
</p>
<p>&bull; Access rights
</p>
<p>&bull; Insurance
</p>
<p>&bull; Handover of tasks/equipment between contractors and in-house personnel
</p>
<p>&bull; Ownership of items on site
</p>
<p>&bull; Contractors profit motive conflicts with the main company&rsquo;s overall interest
</p>
<p>&bull; Termination of contracts
</p>
<p>&bull; Ownership of improvements, developments.
</p>
<p>This list may appear formidable, but airing the potential problems may go some 
</p>
<p>way toward solving them. Ultimately, the benefits of outsourcing need to be suf-
</p>
<p>ficient to more than offset these many factors.</p>

</p>
<p>16.7  Types of Contract
</p>
<p>Labor Only
</p>
<p>Labor is hired and works as directed by in-house staff.
</p>
<p>Time and Materials
</p>
<p>The time taken and materials used are recorded and paid for at agreed rates. The 
</p>
<p>contractor has no specific motivation to be economical, but this is not to say that 
</p>
<p>he will be needlessly extravagant.
</p>
<p>Survey and Quote
</p>
<p>The contractor estimates the work required and then quotes a price for doing it. 
</p>
<p>There will be checking by technical experts on behalf of the outsourcer. Often the 
</p>
<p>same contractor then goes on to carry out the work.
</p>
<p>Work Package
</p>
<p>Labor, tools, and spares are provided to execute defined work.
</p>
<p>Examples: Building contracts; Inspection and routine maintenance of fire safety 
</p>
<p>system.
</p>
<p>Lump Sum
</p>
<p>The contractor agrees to maintain a system in return for an agreed sum of money. 
</p>
<p>The maintenance policy details are left with the contractor. Level-of-service stand-
</p>
<p>ards are defined.
</p>
<p>Performance Based
</p>
<p>Similar to Lump Sum except that the payment is adjusted (up or down) in accord-
</p>
<p>ance with agreed performance standards, such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of plant,
</p>
<p>&bull; Response time to failures,
</p>
<p>&bull; Keeping to schedule, and
</p>
<p>&bull; Turnaround time for rotables.
</p>
<p>This is suitable for situations where the performance criteria can be readily 
</p>
<p>defined. This is generally the preferred type of contract for operational situations.
</p>
<p>Alliance
</p>
<p>The outsourcer and the contractor work in an integrated way to achieve a target 
</p>
<p>result. This type of contract may be necessary for projects involving technological 
</p>
<p>development and/or systems integration. It is important that the outsourcer and the 
</p>
<p>contractor agree on:
</p>
<p>&bull; Project target outcomes,
</p>
<p>&bull; Commercial incentives, and
</p>
<p>&bull; Intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>Conflicts can easily arise in these areas and on-going cooperative goodwill is nec-
</p>
<p>essary for success. Risks tend to revert to the outsourcer&mdash;be careful of this.
</p>
<p>16.7 Types of Contract</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>278 16 Outsourcing
</p>
<p>16.8  Contract Features
</p>
<p>Some common features of outsourcing contracts are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Performance criteria
</p>
<p>&bull; Level of service
</p>
<p>&bull; Incentives, bonus for good performance, and penalty for poor performance
</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of equipment or service by time and duration
</p>
<p>&bull; Security
</p>
<p>&bull; Access rights
</p>
<p>&bull; Continuous improvement&mdash;and partnering for improvements
</p>
<p>&bull; Ownership of intellectual property
</p>
<p>&bull; Insurance cover
</p>
<p>&bull; Contract termination options, procedure, and handover
</p>
<p>&bull; Ownership of equipment used
</p>
<p>&bull; Prime contractor to remain responsible for subcontractors, however, health and 
</p>
<p>safety liabilities cannot be contracted out.
</p>
<p>The contract must allow the contractor sufficient funds to cover costs, deliver a 
</p>
<p>reasonable profit, and allow for contingencies. The nature and range of services 
</p>
<p>must be well defined, and also the performance level.
</p>
<p>Consider a contract for lawn mowing and edge trimming. The performance 
</p>
<p>level should state how high the grass is to be in terms of a range! The choice of 
</p>
<p>frequency of mowing is with the contractor, provided that the range of height 
</p>
<p>is maintained, and may vary with the weather. Some fine details will need to be 
</p>
<p>ironed out, for example, who is responsible for clearing the lawn of toys, and what 
</p>
<p>rules govern the disposal of clippings.
</p>
<p>Emergency response issues are covered in some contracts. Factors to be consid-
</p>
<p>ered include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; range of situations to be covered, definition of the emergencies,
</p>
<p>&bull; period for which covered,
</p>
<p>&bull; nature of response,
</p>
<p>&bull; time to respond,
</p>
<p>&bull; acceptable cost rules for dealing with emergencies, and
</p>
<p>&bull; exclusions.
</p>
<p>16.9  Limiting Risks in Outsourcing
</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor must have necessary skills and management competence.
</p>
<p>&bull; Address sources of potential problems at the contract stage.
</p>
<p>&bull; Be prepared to stay with in-sourced solutions, or to revert to in-sourcing if nec-
</p>
<p>essary, particularly to cover urgent tasks, critical machines, or critical services.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>279
</p>
<p>&bull; Keep links with affected employees.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use more than one contractor.
</p>
<p>&bull; Keep contracts to moderate length.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use performance-based contracts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have contract provisions allowing you to react to an emergency by funding 
</p>
<p>overtime, extra resources, or specific direction of resources to the emergency on 
</p>
<p>hand.
</p>
<p>&bull; Primary contractor to have responsibility for their subcontractors. However, 
</p>
<p>when problems occur, the contractor will still blame the subcontractors. It is 
</p>
<p>advisable to involve the subcontractors in meetings and ensure that their opin-
</p>
<p>ions are heard and that they are party to all necessary information, without let-
</p>
<p>ting the main contractor pass off the risk.
</p>
<p>&bull; Create and retain in-house strength in:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Highly skilled technicians&mdash;have a minimal number and look after them
</p>
<p>&ndash; Asset management
</p>
<p>&ndash; Technical specialists
</p>
<p>&ndash; Contract negotiators
</p>
<p>&ndash; Contract managers and performance auditors
</p>
<p>&ndash; Customer support resources
</p>
<p>&bull; Succession planning is needed for all of the above
</p>
<p>&bull; Expect the contractor to make a reasonable profit, otherwise he may go out of 
</p>
<p>business and you will be left to pick up the pieces.
</p>
<p>16.9.1  Audit
</p>
<p>An audit system should be established to check and report on contractor perfor-
</p>
<p>mance. This should compare actual service levels and other performance indica-
</p>
<p>tors against targets, and should check on performance of equipment in terms of 
</p>
<p>reliability and availability.
</p>
<p>16.10  Outsourcing Result
</p>
<p>Outsourcing means that the outsourcer becomes an Asset Manager rather than a 
</p>
<p>maintainer. There will be a need to continually deal with issues related to service 
</p>
<p>delivery. So hat jener seiner Sorgen, to quote a German proverb.
</p>
<p>If problems arise you can invoke the contract, but if the arrangements fail the 
</p>
<p>problems revert to the outsourcer. You can outsource the task, but you cannot out-
</p>
<p>source the (ultimate) responsibility.
</p>
<p>16.9 Limiting Risks in Outsourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>280 16 Outsourcing
</p>
<p>16.10.1  Example
</p>
<p>The Victoria State Government outsourced the operation of part of its suburban 
</p>
<p>railway network to a contractor. However, the contractor later walked away when 
</p>
<p>they decided that they could not make a profit from the arrangement. The pas-
</p>
<p>sengers still needed to be carried, however, so the problem landed back with the 
</p>
<p>government. Fortunately, they had used another contractor for another part of the 
</p>
<p>railway and they were able to get that contractor to pick up the slack. In these cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, the outsourcer often realizes that the original contract did not allow 
</p>
<p>enough profit margin and is willing to make a more generous deal the second time 
</p>
<p>around.
</p>
<p>16.11  Contractor Viewpoint
</p>
<p>Avoid sovereign risk, that is, situations where someone else (e.g., a regulator or 
</p>
<p>government entity) can change the rules after your costs are fixed. Contract for a 
</p>
<p>known service at a known cost. For example, contract for delivering system avail-
</p>
<p>ability, rather than for operational utilization or actual sales revenue, or for any 
</p>
<p>measure which depends on factors outside your control.
</p>
<p>The contract must be sufficiently profitable in terms of the usual investment 
</p>
<p>criteria and contain adequate provision to cover contingencies and to encourage 
</p>
<p>further investment and growth. Identify risks, and ensure that the contract protects 
</p>
<p>you against these as far as possible. Remember that politics can change and that 
</p>
<p>public servants are interested (like the chicken providing the breakfast egg) but 
</p>
<p>they are not involved (unlike the pig providing the bacon).
</p>
<p>Consider business continuity. A one-off contract may require initial investment 
</p>
<p>which requires significant continuity of business in order to recoup.
</p>
<p>Consider payment terms and cash flow issues. Insist on being paid on time.
</p>
<p>16.12  Build Own Operate Transfer (BOOT)
</p>
<p>A contractor bidding to build a building will aim to provide value in terms of $ per 
</p>
<p>square meter. However, if the same contractor was also going to operate the build-
</p>
<p>ing (e.g., residence, warehouse, and prison) the design would take more account of 
</p>
<p>operational and maintenance factors. The owner should focus on through life costs 
</p>
<p>of the entire operation and not just initial costs. BOOT contracts can assist in this 
</p>
<p>process.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>281
</p>
<p>16.13  Public Private Partnerships (PPP)
</p>
<p>Public Private Partnerships are arrangements whereby government and industry 
</p>
<p>get together to work on a major project. Examples include roads, railways, and 
</p>
<p>desalination plants. The reasoning behind these arrangements is that the public 
</p>
<p>sector and the private sector each have different areas of strength, and bringing 
</p>
<p>them together can produce an effective and timely result. The strengths which the 
</p>
<p>different parties bring to a ppp are summarized in Fig. 16.1.
</p>
<p>An example of a ppp is the building of a cross-city toll tunnel in Sydney. The 
</p>
<p>tunnel was duly completed and the government and contractors were happy, but 
</p>
<p>the public became resentful, because the government closed some alternative road 
</p>
<p>routes and the toll charges were high. Public opinion forced the government to 
</p>
<p>back down on some closures and charges. This led to legal conflict with the con-
</p>
<p>tractor and to the contractor losing money.
</p>
<p>The positive side of ppp is that the project generally gets built! Without the 
</p>
<p>cooperation of both sectors, the combination of political, financial, and technologi-
</p>
<p>cal delays can drag a project out over many years.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe the factors involved in supporting 
</p>
<p>physical assets from the point of introduction into service, over their lifetime through 
</p>
<p>to disposal. These factors also influence the initial choice of equipment. Outcomes In 
</p>
<p>this chapter you will learn that many problems in physical asset management can be 
</p>
<p>reduced by considering the supportability of equipment at the acquisition stage. You 
</p>
<p>will learn about the factors that need to be taken into account in planning equipment 
</p>
<p>support, and will be provided with check lists to assist this type of planning.
</p>
<p>17.1  Introduction1
</p>
<p>Physical assets require the support of people, services, and resources of many types, 
</p>
<p>including operators, maintainers, repair facilities, consumables, spare parts, docu-
</p>
<p>mentation, and training. To ensure that these supports are provided and budgeted 
</p>
<p>for, several types of analysis are needed. The following techniques are applicable:
</p>
<p>&bull; Logistic Support Analysis&mdash;the detailed analysis of support requirements.
</p>
<p>&bull; Level of Repair Analysis&mdash;is concerned with deciding where particular types of 
</p>
<p>repair will be carried out, for example, what will be done by local technicians, 
</p>
<p>what by central workshops, and so on.
</p>
<p>&bull; Integrated Logistic Support&mdash;is a system for ensuring that, once we have 
</p>
<p>decided on our logistic support concept, all aspects necessary to implement it 
</p>
<p>are identified and implemented.
</p>
<p>&bull; Through Life Support&mdash;is a concept which emphasizes the need for logistic 
</p>
<p>support to extend over the whole life of the equipment. This consideration is 
</p>
<p>important where contracts for support are to be let.
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier Viewpoint&mdash;Under this heading we consider the issue of logistic sup-
</p>
<p>port from the point of view of a manufacturer or supplier, for whom both com-
</p>
<p>mitments and business opportunities exist.
</p>

<p>286 17 Logistic Support
</p>
<p>The aims of these techniques are to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Form a basis for planning and budgeting for the logistic support of equipment 
</p>
<p>from acquisition through operation to disposal&mdash;through life support;
</p>
<p>&bull; Take account of costs over the life cycle of equipment, and not just focus on 
</p>
<p>minimizing acquisition cost.
</p>
<p>In the case of common user equipment, purchased and used in an urban or indus-
</p>
<p>trial environment with many surrounding support services, the techniques outlined 
</p>
<p>in this chapter are relatively easy to apply. This does not mean that the principles 
</p>
<p>involved can be ignored or that it is impossible to go wrong. However, the availa-
</p>
<p>ble support of equipment distributors, manufacturers, and specialized maintenance 
</p>
<p>organizations can greatly reduce the extent to which asset owners need to deal 
</p>
<p>with the details of logistic support. By contrast, if we are to operate away from a 
</p>
<p>supportive environment, great care must be taken to ensure that the essential logis-
</p>
<p>tic support elements are in place.
</p>

</p>
<p>17.2  Logistic Support Analysis (LSA)
</p>
<p>Logistic support analysis is the determination of the equipment, people, and facili-
</p>
<p>ties required to support a given capability throughout its life. Logistic support analy-
</p>
<p>sis is designed to determine the &ldquo;what, how, and where&rdquo; of the provision of support

</p>
<p>resources and services for physical equipment. It is carried out in the early decision 
</p>
<p>making phase of an acquisition plan. The aim of LSA is to ensure that our assets can 
</p>
<p>be logistically supported in a practical and cost-effective way, and to define how this 
</p>
<p>can be done. The analysis may influence the choice of the equipment itself, and will 
</p>
<p>influence the nature and structure of our supporting services. LSA is concerned with:
</p>
<p>&bull; assessing the net maintenance and logistics load created by the asset,
</p>
<p>&bull; setting the maintenance and repair policies at a strategic level,
</p>
<p>&bull; establishing the extent and location of maintenance, repair, and overhaul 
</p>
<p>facilities. This may involve decisions to outsource some or all of these tasks,
</p>
<p>&bull; costing for the above.
</p>
<p>Logistic support analysis starts by identifying the type and quantity of assets 
</p>
<p>involved, the utilization rate, and service level required. For example, with a 
</p>
<p>vehicle fleet this will mean identifying the vehicle types, quantities, availabilities, 
</p>
<p>and average kilometers run per year. At this stage we will also identify any special 
</p>
<p>environmental or operational factors that affect our analysis. This can include 
</p>
<p>climatic factors such as heat, cold, dust, or corrosive environments and operational 
</p>
<p>factors such as equipment loading and planned equipment availability. In addition, 
</p>
<p>we consider the extent to which new equipment will replace existing equipment, 
</p>
<p>and the impact that this will have on the net requirement for logistic support.
</p>
<p>17.2.1  Logistic Support Basic Data
</p>
<p>In order to carry out LSA, basic data regarding the equipment to be supported 
</p>
<p>must be established. This includes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset type
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset quantity
</p>
<p>&bull; Utilization rate or &ldquo;rate of effort&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; Planned equipment availability
</p>
<p>&bull; Period of support or overall operation duration
</p>
<p>&bull; Specific environmental or operational factors
</p>
<p>&bull; Nature and quantity of equipment to be retired and the effect of this on support 
</p>
<p>requirements.
</p>
<p>17.2.2  Logistic Support Detailed Factors
</p>
<p>LSA continues with an analysis of the logistics of operational support, including the 
</p>
<p>provision, transport, and storage of consumables. This can be summarized as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Consumables by type
</p>
<p>&bull; Consumption rate
</p>
<p>&bull; Transportation
</p>

</p>
<p>&bull; Access
</p>
<p>&bull; Storage
</p>
<p>&bull; Shelf life of consumables
</p>
<p>&bull; Waste disposal
</p>
<p>We then turn to a consideration of operation, maintenance, repair, and overhaul. 
</p>
<p>Factors include the life of the prime equipment, the major assemblies or subsidi-
</p>
<p>ary items involved, the provision of maintenance facilities and of spare parts. Key 
</p>
<p>points are summarized as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Planned life of main equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; LSA mission duration (e.g, provisioning of spares for first 3 years)
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment criticality, reliability, and availability targets
</p>
<p>&bull; Test and evaluation criteria and standards
</p>
<p>&bull; Extent of in-house and/or outsourced support
</p>
<p>&bull; Major assemblies types and life
</p>
<p>&bull; Repair/Replace policy
</p>
<p>&bull; Spares and Rotables requirements
</p>
<p>&bull; Level of repair policy
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance facilities
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance labor requirements
</p>
<p>&bull; Support and test equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Operator training and training facilities
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintainer training and training facilities.
</p>
<p>17.3  Level of Repair Analysis (LORA)3
</p>
<p>Level of Repair Analysis is concerned with determining maintenance policy. This 
</p>
<p>will involve repair or replace policy and where various maintenance activities are 
</p>
<p>to be carried out, so that appropriate staff and facilities can be provided.
</p>
<p>Technical and economic considerations are used to determine whether an 
</p>
<p>item should be repaired or replaced upon its failure, and in the case of repairs, to 
</p>
<p>determine at which location the repair will be carried out.
</p>
<p>For example, an electricity transmission company was planning the acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion of a new radio communication system for use by field repair teams. Following 
</p>
<p>a LORA, the maintenance policy adopted was that only first line repairs would 
</p>
<p>be carried out by the company. These consisted of performance checks, setting 
</p>
<p>adjustments, and complete unit or subunit replacements. No second or third line 
</p>
<p>work was to be carried out by the company. A support contract was made with the 
</p>
<p>supplier to accept any items requiring deeper maintenance and to provide refur-
</p>
<p>bished or new replacement items within an agreed turnaround timeframe.
</p>

</p>
<p>In general, LORA is used to determine at what level of the organization main-
</p>
<p>tenance work will be carried out for each preventive maintenance activity and in 
</p>
<p>response to each failure mode. Figure 17.2 illustrates the type of factors involved 
</p>
<p>in a level of repair decision.
</p>
<p>Figure 17.3 shows the overall position as we decide what work is to be car-
</p>
<p>ried out at each level for the fleet as a whole, and the resources and facilities 
</p>
<p>needed at each level. LORA analysis provides the basis from which we can esti-
</p>
<p>mate the type and volume of work which is required at each level of repair. This 
</p>
<p>then determines where we locate resources (e.g., test and repair equipment), and 
</p>
<p>where to stock spare parts. To evaluate an entire system from scratch, including 
</p>
<p>costing all options is a considerable task. In practice, for any particular acqui-
</p>
<p>sition we can usually draw on experience from similar or existing equipment, 
</p>
<p>although this does not mean that we should not fully consider the options and 
</p>
<p>how developments of equipment and technology impact on the development of 
</p>
<p>logistic support.
</p>
<p>17.3.1  Levels of Repair
</p>
<p>The different levels are as follows:
</p>
<p>17.3.1.1  Operator Maintenance
</p>
<p>Operators should have some responsibility for, and ownership in, the equipment 
</p>
<p>which they operate.
</p>
<p>We do not do this repair:
</p>
<p>Stock a replacement.
</p>
<p>We do this repair:
</p>
<p>Decide at what level, e.g
first or second line.
</p>
<p>LORA
</p>
<p>For each possible 
repair, consider 
requirement for:
</p>
<p>Skilled personnel
</p>
<p>Technical facilities
</p>
<p>Spares, consumables, 
repair pools
</p>
<p>Communications
</p>
<p>Buildings
</p>
<p>Transport
</p>
<p>Documentation and

<p>17.3.1.3  First Line Maintenance
</p>
<p>Plan the range of repairs to be carried out at first line, that is at the user area, with 
</p>
<p>local technical support, diagnosis, and troubleshooting. Estimate the numbers

</p>
<p>17.3.1.4  Second Line Maintenance
</p>
<p>This provides workshop facilities in a general location to support major plant, 
</p>
<p>or as a support facility for plant scattered over a geographical area. Consider 
</p>
<p>any particular repairs or system changeovers that will be carried out at this level 
</p>
<p>and determine the corresponding requirement for facilities such as heavy lift-
</p>

</p>
<p>This provides in-depth facilities, e.g., overhauls, and may be provided by a 
</p>
<p>equipment manufacturer, a supplier, or a contractor.
</p>
<p>17.3.1.6  Rotables
</p>
<p>Rotables are components which are sent away for repair and then returned. Level 
</p>
<p>of repair analysis involves considering whether some components should fall into 
</p>
<p>this category and in making arrangements for the repair process.
</p>
<p>17.3.1.7  Example
</p>
<p>For a vehicle fleet, the type and quantity of vehicles and the planned utilization 
</p>
<p>will form a basis for estimating the amount of servicing and first and second 
</p>
<p>line repair work which will be required per year. From this data we can decide 
</p>
<p>whether a dedicated vehicle servicing facility is required, whether to provide and 
</p>
<p>staff this in-house at a specific location, or whether to let an outsourcing con-
</p>
<p>tract. We can also estimate the requirement for workshop facilities, in-house or 
</p>
<p>outsourced.
</p>
<p>17.4  Integrated Logistic Support (ILS)4,5
</p>
<p>Integrated Logistic Support is a system for ensuring that all items and services 
</p>
<p>necessary to implement the support of items are identified and arranged for. 
</p>
<p>Integrated Logistic Support is a follow-up to LSA. ILS uses formal check lists as 
</p>
<p>an aid to identifying the items to be supplied and checked as satisfactory before 
</p>
<p>the equipment is formally accepted by the user.
</p>
<p>Integrated Logistic Support starts from the list of assets forming the capability, 
</p>
<p>noting the amount of equipment involved, and the utilization rate. For example, with 
</p>
<p>a vehicle fleet this will mean identifying the vehicle types, quantities, and average 
</p>
<p>kilometers run per year. Figure 17.4 indicates the scope of factors covered by ILS.

<p>17.6  Through Life Support
</p>
<p>The through life support of assets is provided by support systems which cover a 
</p>
<p>range of activities including:
</p>
<p>&bull; Operations
</p>
<p>&bull; Supply
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance
</p>
<p>&bull; Engineering
</p>
<p>&bull; Training
</p>
<p>An indication of the range of support activities required is given in Fig. 17.5.
</p>
<p>17.7  Configuration Management Plan
</p>
<p>The configuration of an equipment means the detail of its specification and its key 
</p>
<p>assemblies. In managing deployed assets it will be necessary to keep track of the 
</p>
<p>configuration of the items, as modifications occur, variant models are introduced, or, 
</p>
<p>in the case of fixed plant, new facilities are added and old ones become disused. A 
</p>
<p>viable plan for configuration management should be formed at the logistic support 
</p>
<p>planning stage. More detail of configuration management itself is given in Sect. 11.8.

<p>17.8  Through Life Support Contract
</p>
<p>Factors to be considered in letting a through life support contract include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance support
</p>
<p>&bull; Supply support
</p>
<p>&bull; Engineering support
</p>
<p>&bull; Labor augmentation for periods of high demand or specific needs
</p>
<p>&bull; Cataloging
</p>
<p>Performance indicators relating to such a contract include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Prime equipment availability
</p>
<p>&bull; Rotables availability
</p>
<p>&bull; Reliability following repair.
</p>
<p>17.9  Logistic Support Example
</p>
<p>A logistic support example is shown in Fig. 17.6. This relates to the acquisition of 
</p>
<p>a considerable number of large earth moving machines for a remote site.
</p>
<p>Five percent of the acquisition budget was committed for the purchase of spare 
</p>
<p>parts. This was intended to cover the first 3 years of operation.
</p>
<p>At the point of introduction into service, supporting documentation was deliv-
</p>
<p>ered concurrently, along with familiarization and training courses for operators 
</p>
<p>and maintainers.

<p>At first line repair, test kits were supplied to provide a range of tests for items 
</p>
<p>which needed to be checked before possibly being shipped back for deeper repair. 
</p>
<p>Budget ($X) was set aside for rotables which were to be exchanged and shipped 
</p>
<p>back to either second line or the supplier.
</p>
<p>At second line repair, a similar arrangement was made, with allocated budget 
</p>
<p>($Y), allowed for repair and return of items requiring repair at the supplier&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>facilities.
</p>
<p>Numerous cheap but essential items (nickel and dime parts) were seen as a 
</p>
<p>problem as it was important not to use inferior substitutes. Contacts were estab-
</p>
<p>lished to obtain these from reputable sources.
</p>
<p>Configuration management was put in place, but it was recognized that loss of 
</p>
<p>configuration in relation to current models would be a problem over time. This 
</p>
<p>would ultimately be solved by replacement of the fleet.
</p>
<p>17.10  Supplier or Contractor Viewpoint
</p>
<p>Suppliers and contractors involved in the original equipment provision are usu-
</p>
<p>ally involved in subsequent logistic support. There will be a requirement for the 
</p>
<p>supplier to provide user documentation and information relating to equipment 
</p>
<p>operation, including safety issues, and this is often augmented by a performance 
</p>

<p>5% of acquisition budget committed at the time of 
initial purchase to buy rotables, repair parts and 
</p>
<p>spare parts.
</p>
<p>$X committed for direct exchange rotables.  
Actual cost+ charged for repair of rotables and return to pool.
</p>
<p>$Y committed for repair and return items.  Actual 
cost+ is charged for repair and return.  These items 
</p>
<p>were out of service during repair.
</p>
<p>Local test kits were established for testing items 
before they were shipped back for repair.
</p>
<p>Contacts were established to locate and purchase 
&ldquo;nickel and dime&rdquo; parts, such as nuts, bolts, 
</p>
<p>washers, cables&hellip;
</p>
<p>Introduction into service:  All items including 
documentation were delivered to users in a block, 
</p>
<p>with familiarization and training courses for 
operation and maintenance. This was concurrent
</p>
<p>with item delivery.
</p>
<p>Loss of  configuration with current models is a 
problem over time.

<p>warranty. Maintenance recommendations, workshop manuals, and spare parts 
</p>
<p>catalogs are also developed and provided by the original equipment manufacturer 
</p>
<p>(OEM) or supplier.
</p>
<p>From the supplier or contractor&rsquo;s viewpoint, the provision of logistic support 
</p>
<p>beyond the basic minimum is an additional business opportunity, although care 
</p>
<p>must be taken to ensure that costs are covered and an adequate profit is generated. 
</p>
<p>The provision of logistic support by a supplier can also be a plus in securing the 
</p>
<p>original sale. However, users must be aware that suppliers can only provide sup-
</p>
<p>port to the extent that it is good business to do so. It is common for users to under-
</p>
<p>estimate the cost of providing support, and thus to have unrealistic expectations of 
</p>
<p>support provisions. If on-going support is to be provided by a manufacturer, they 
</p>
<p>need to consider the cost of maintaining production processes for original equip-
</p>
<p>ment and components to which they are committing, and to identify the people 
</p>
<p>and facilities needed to maintain support, in terms of skill sets, numbers, training 
</p>
<p>requirements, and training facilities.
</p>
<p>Services that may be provided on a contract basis include:
</p>
<p> a. consumables provision, transportation, and storage;
</p>
<p> b. spare parts provision and stock holding;
</p>
<p> c. support for introduction into service;
</p>
<p> d. repair, maintenance, and overhaul support;
</p>
<p> e. training of operators and maintainers;
</p>
<p> f. training of operator and maintainer trainers;
</p>
<p> g. technical data management;
</p>
<p> h. configuration management;
</p>
<p> i. support facilities and test equipment;
</p>
<p> j. disposal process.
</p>
<p>As a supplier, it is important to adequately cost the provision of such services and 
</p>
<p>to assess the physical and cost requirements over the life cycle of the equipment 
</p>
<p>which is supported. Activity-based costing can be important in this application. 
</p>
<p>Do not try to subsidize the logistic support contract from the initial sale contract. 
</p>
<p>Consideration will need to be given to the provision of the skills required for the 
</p>
<p>tasks to be undertaken, and to being able to retain these skills out into the future. A 
</p>
<p>common approach is to establish separate distributor and support businesses which 
</p>
<p>need to be viable in their own right.
</p>
<p>Key elements of logistic support provision are the same in principle as for the 
</p>
<p>user, but the support may extend across a range of users, so the types and numbers 
</p>
<p>of items must be assessed accordingly. Thus we need to consider the following 
</p>
<p>aspects across the range of items supported.
</p>
<p>&bull; The types of item for which maintenance is to be supplied;
</p>
<p>&bull; The numbers of items of each type;
</p>
<p>&bull; The level of utilization;
</p>
<p>&bull; Operating environment and any special factors arising from this.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>297
</p>
<p>Identify the maintenance level to be covered such as;
</p>
<p>&bull; workshop inspection and repairs,
</p>
<p>&bull; deeper maintenance,
</p>
<p>&bull; overhauls,
</p>
<p>&bull; rotables and related repair pools,
</p>
<p>&bull; repair/replace policy and related equipment replacement pools.
</p>
<p>Plan numbers of trainees for operations, maintenance, and trainers; prepare train-
</p>
<p>ing facilities; provide an online spares catalog and cost the service provision.
</p>
<p>Consider the cost and practicality of maintaining the resources and skill sets 
</p>
<p>necessary to provide the intended support services over the contract period. The 
</p>
<p>equipment supported and the range of technical facilities required in your business 
</p>
<p>will change over time and personnel will retire or move on. Do not under estimate 
</p>
<p>the cost of support provision for aging assets. Consider disposal of consumables, 
</p>
<p>used and unused spares and equipment. Consider the cost of contract preparation, 
</p>
<p>negotiation, and on-going management.

<p>17.11  Cunning at the Castle
</p>
<p>Scene: An Ante-Chamber in the Palace
</p>
<p>Enter Roderick, an asset manager and Cuthbert, a political strategist.
</p>
<p>R: Look here Cuthbert, this plan of King Henry&rsquo;s is crazy. He wants to take the 
</p>
<p>army to France and conquer it!
</p>
<p>C: What&rsquo;s wrong with that?
</p>
<p>R: The French will knock the stuffing out of our lot, that&rsquo;s what
</p>
<p>C: Surely not&mdash;what about Agincourt and the gallant English archers?
</p>
<p>R: Don&rsquo;t forget the Welsh&mdash;but either way the archers are no more. They were 
</p>
<p>disbanded after Formigny
</p>
<p>C: Formy&mdash;what?
</p>
<p>R: Never mind&mdash;it&rsquo;s French. It won&rsquo;t feature in English history because we lost. 
</p>
<p>The point is that the French have cannons that outrange our archers by a mile 
</p>
<p>and can crumble a castle like chips. We&rsquo;ve got no chance against them until our 
</p>
<p>boys down at the Arsenal develop some new skills
</p>
<p>C: So we need a strategy
</p>
<p>R: It&rsquo;s more serious than that, Cuthbert, we need to do something. Get thinking
</p>
<p>C: thinks&hellip;&hellip;Maybe we could make the French expedition more of a fashion 
</p>
<p>show. The French are cool dudes and if we work it so that Henry goes &ldquo;all-
</p>
<p>clinking in gold like a heathen god,&rdquo; to coin a phrase&mdash;but just wants to gallop 
</p>
<p>around flashing the Spurs&mdash;then they might buy it
</p>
<p>R: Good one Cuthbert. The French first team is off in Italy as it happens; its game 
</p>
<p>on at Milan. So we&rsquo;ll go for your plan. Vive le spin

<p>C: The French trip is under control, but it&rsquo;s the Scots that I&rsquo;m worried about. 
</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting up a mighty head of steam with King Jimmy and the Bishop 
</p>
<p>telling them they can beat hell out of us and grab England now Henry is over in 
</p>
<p>France. Get your thinking cap on to that one
</p>
<p>R: Nothing that some creative asset management can&rsquo;t handle; we&rsquo;ll send Henry&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>troops only the old gear, bows and arrows, swords and heavy armor, and keep 
</p>
<p>the newer stuff here
</p>
<p>C: Good, but who&rsquo;s going to run the show against the Scots?
</p>
<p>R: Easy&mdash;Queen Katherine. She may not be good at producing sons but she sure 
</p>
<p>can run a war
</p>
<p>C: She can&rsquo;t lead the army though&mdash;and don&rsquo;t tell me about Joan of Arc
</p>
<p>R: No, but she&rsquo;s smart enough to put Tommy Norfolk in charge. We&rsquo;ll draft requi-
</p>
<p>sitions for the supporting logistics, and bring in plenty of those soccer hooligans 
</p>
<p>from up North
</p>
<p>Some months later in a back room of the Palace
</p>
<p>R: Nice one Cuthbert!
</p>
<p>C: Nice one Roderick!
</p>
<p>They drink
</p>
<p>R:  Henry flashed his Hampton in Flanders and good old Norfolk gave Scotland a 
</p>
<p>flogging at Flodden
</p>
<p>C:  Just shows what you can do when political strategy and asset management 
</p>
<p>work together
</p>
<p>R: But methinks we should retire posthaste. Henry is at the gate.

<p>Good housekeeping
</p>
<p>Abstract To describe the features and organizational structures used in care of 
</p>
<p>assets from good housekeeping through to basic maintenance. To consider per-
</p>
<p>formance monitoring and recording and continuous improvement techniques. 
</p>
<p>Outcomes After reading this chapter you will understand the importance of good 
</p>
<p>housekeeping and basic maintenance and how to organize the workplace so that 
</p>
<p>these are well managed. You will be aware of the continuous improvement cycle 
</p>
<p>and techniques associated with it.
</p>
<p>18.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>An essential requirement of successful asset management is taking care of assets. 
</p>
<p>This involves activities at several levels, ranging from cleanliness and good 
</p>
<p>housekeeping by the user or operator, to first-line maintenance activities such 
</p>
<p>as servicing, lubrication, and adjustment, to second-line maintenance involv-
</p>
<p>ing repairs and assembly changes, and on to deeper maintenance or overhaul. In 
</p>
<p>addition, there are many technical factors in maintenance, including condition 
</p>
<p>monitoring.
</p>
<p>Determining the right level of maintenance activity and hence of expenditure is 
</p>
<p>not an easy task. The role of asset managers is to be aware of available techniques 
</p>
<p>both in terms of management and technology and to apply them appropriately to 
</p>
<p>the benefit of the business. It may be tempting to senior managers to demand more 
</p>
<p>production or to cut maintenance budgets as a response to problems, but such 
</p>
<p>actions quickly become counterproductive if the basic care and maintenance of 
</p>
<p>assets is neglected.

</p>
<p>18.2  Total Productive Maintenance or Asset Basic Care
</p>
<p>At first-line level, in a manufacturing context, the process of caring for assets is 
</p>
<p>referred to as Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). A more general term is Asset 
</p>
<p>Basic Care. Asset Basic Care/TPM involves workplace employees, such as opera-
</p>
<p>tors and first-line maintenance staff in achieving a high standard of care of assets 
</p>
<p>as an integral part of their normal work. The main focus in Asset Basic Care is 
</p>
<p>on the people and how they do their work. Asset Basic Care/TPM is non-heroic 
</p>
<p>maintenance. This means doing the routine things well, rather than an emphasis on 
</p>
<p>heroic repair jobs. The major elements include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Cleanliness and good housekeeping;
</p>
<p>&bull; Routine inspection, lubrication, and adjustment;
</p>
<p>&bull; Focus on machine knowledge, machine performance, quality of output and 
</p>
<p>elimination of losses;
</p>
<p>&bull; A sense of ownership by operators and first-line maintainers.
</p>
<p>The concepts in Asset Basic Care/TPM are summarized in Fig. 18.1.
</p>
<p>18.2.1  Workplace Tidiness and Organization
</p>
<p>The first essential of asset basic care is a tidy workplace. Some areas have never 
</p>
<p>been tidied up since the industrial revolution. Remove unused or inessential items, 
</p>
<p>especially:
</p>
<p>&bull; old or imperfect product
</p>
<p>&bull; surplus materials,
</p>
<p>&bull; obsolete or unnecessary tools,
</p>
<p>&bull; obsolete fixtures,
</p>
<p>&bull; obsolete or inessential documents, and
</p>
<p>&bull; horse-drawn wagons unless it is a theme park.
</p>
<p>Having tidied up, get organized. For each workplace list all required:
</p>
<p>&bull; tools and instruments,
</p>
<p>&bull; implements,
</p>
<p>&bull; accessories, and
</p>
<p>&bull; consumables.
</p>
<p>Determine a place for all essential items and provide:
</p>
<p>&bull; shelves,
</p>
<p>&bull; containers,
</p>
<p>&bull; holders, and
</p>
<p>&bull; labeling.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>305
</p>
<p>Use simple indicators, e.g., marks on the floor, colored shelves to show placement 
</p>
<p>of essential items. Use these facilities and keep items visible.
</p>
<p>18.2.2  Maintain Standards
</p>
<p>&bull; Take countermeasures against dirt and dust.
</p>
<p>&bull; Determine how everything is to be kept clean.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide equipment such as brushes, cloths, vacuum cleaners, and dish washers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Design out systematic uncleanliness, using shields, covers, waste disposal meth-
</p>
<p>ods, etc.
</p>
<p>&bull; Make cleaning and tidying up a standard part of every job.

<p>306 18 Asset Basic Care
</p>
<p>Set cleaning and tidying standards and routines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Assign responsibilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Rotate tasks among operators and allow them to agree on who does what.
</p>
<p>&bull; Specify cleaning time, e.g., 5 min at end of each shift and half hour per week, 
</p>
<p>plus if idle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Assign responsibilities for all aspects of supply, storage, and disposal of work-
</p>
<p>place items.
</p>
<p>18.2.3  Training
</p>
<p>Create the training material for:
</p>
<p>&bull; correct operating conditions and procedures
</p>
<p>&bull; machine knowledge
</p>
<p>&bull; basic maintenance procedures
</p>
<p>&bull; fault reporting procedures
</p>
<p>&bull; knowledge of existing types of faults or losses.
</p>
<p>This is done by supervisors and experienced maintenance personnel, initially for 
</p>
<p>a pilot area, later extended to all operations. Training facilities are needed, e.g., 
</p>
<p>training room next to the shop floor, white board, projector, and training materials.
</p>
<p>18.2.4  Machine Knowledge
</p>
<p>Develop and display machine information on notice boards beside the machines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Name of machine
</p>
<p>&bull; What it is intended to do
</p>
<p>&bull; How it works&mdash;without going into unnecessary technical detail; use simple flow chart
</p>
<p>&bull; Written, step-by-step details of all necessary procedures, including operating 
</p>
<p>conditions, e.g., temperature, pressure, vibration, and alignment checks.
</p>
<p>&bull; Troubleshooting guide.
</p>
<p>The creation and maintenance of this material is a worthwhile learning task for 
</p>
<p>young graduates.
</p>
<p>18.3  Basic Maintenance
</p>
<p>Asset performance and sustainment are greatly improved if equipment is kept in 
</p>
<p>good condition. To achieve this, basic maintenance must be carried out on a regu-
</p>
<p>lar basis. Besides cleanliness, this includes lubrication, adjustment of things that </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>307
</p>
<p>are intended to be adjusted, and tightening or replacement of loose or missing nuts 
</p>
<p>and bolts. In Asset Basic Care/TPM, we organize basic maintenance with the aid 
</p>
<p>of the following steps:
</p>
<p>&bull; Create basic maintenance procedures, standards, and routines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Specify maintenance and inspection intervals and times.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify and document lubrication points, adjustment points, checks for nut or 
</p>
<p>bolt tightness and anything else that the operators or first-line maintainers can 
</p>
<p>usefully know.
</p>
<p>&bull; Color code lubrication points and adjustment points by interval, e.g., daily, 
</p>
<p>weekly, and monthly checks.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify abnormal conditions in specific terms, e.g., pressure or temperature 
</p>
<p>gage readings, measurements, flow rates.
</p>
<p>&bull; Specify action to be taken (e.g., call the mechanic) if conditions are abnormal.
</p>
<p>&bull; Define basic inspection procedures, this can include checks for:
</p>
<p>&ndash; Loose, missing, broken bolts fasteners, clamps, etc.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Frame and structural cracks, weld failures, etc.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Corrosion
</p>
<p>&ndash; Wear
</p>
<p>&ndash; Vibration
</p>
<p>&ndash; Oil/fuel/coolant/air leaks,
</p>
<p>&ndash; Accident damage, e.g., bent sheet metal, broken items, etc.
</p>
<p>&bull; Specify action to be taken from inspection results, including immediate correc-
</p>
<p>tive action, and the raising of work requests for activities which can be deferred. 
</p>
<p>Define how to report conditions which are outside the operator&rsquo;s scope of 
</p>
<p>activity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Train workforce personnel in basic maintenance, diagnostics, and reporting.
</p>
<p>&bull; Assign responsibilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Rotate tasks among operators and allow them to agree on who does what.
</p>
<p>18.3.1  Assign Housekeeping and Basic Maintenance Tasks
</p>
<p>Appraise tasks and assign them as you think best, with input from those involved. 
</p>
<p>The essential thing is that all tasks are assigned, Fig. 18.2 shows examples of pos-
</p>
<p>sible assignments.
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.2  Assignment of

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>308 18 Asset Basic Care
</p>
<p>18.3.2  Routine Maintenance by Technicians
</p>
<p>More technical maintenance activities will normally be assigned to technicians. 
</p>
<p>Particular attention must be paid to the carrying out of maintenance activities 
</p>
<p>which are required by law or by good practice, such a boiler or pressure vessel 
</p>
<p>inspections.
</p>
<p>18.3.3  Accredit Workers
</p>
<p>After training, test the competency of workers on machine knowledge, operation, 
</p>
<p>and basic maintenance. Recognize their achievements by accrediting them to oper-
</p>
<p>ate the relevant machines; give them a certificate. This may involve upgrading and 
</p>
<p>higher pay, but an overall payoff can be expected.
</p>
<p>The workers closest to the equipment, operators, and first-line maintenance 
</p>
<p>technicians, have the greatest level of involvement and the greatest degree of 
</p>
<p>equipment knowledge at the user level. This knowledge can be leveraged by 
</p>
<p>empowering the workers to take a wide range of actions in support of production 
</p>
<p>operation and maintenance. In addition to good housekeeping and basic mainte-
</p>
<p>nance, these actions can include the replenishment of work place equipment, 
</p>
<p>contact with second-line maintenance, participation in quality and condition-mon-
</p>
<p>itoring activities and performance recording and analysis. Participation in continu-
</p>
<p>ous improvement activities and root cause failure analysis activities should also be 
</p>
<p>encouraged.
</p>
<p>18.4  Performance Recording
</p>
<p>Collect and display simple statistics, e.g.,
</p>
<p>&bull; Machine down time by weeks (time lost to operators).
</p>
<p>&bull; Machine lost time by weeks (time machine available but not effectively used by 
</p>
<p>operators).
</p>
<p>&bull; Quality losses by weeks, numbers of subquality product.
</p>
<p>&bull; Unplanned maintenance activity by months, showing type of breakdown/repair.
</p>
<p>&bull; Time spent on (particular) setups.
</p>
<p>&bull; Causes of losses sequenced by frequency of occurrence.
</p>
<p>&bull; Causes of losses sequenced by cost significance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Trend over time to show improvements and opportunities.</p>

</p>
<p>18.5  Continuous Improvement1
</p>
<p>Continuous Improvement is an ongoing process whereby we try to improve products, 
</p>
<p>services, or processes, in incremental steps. This approach is in contrast to, though not 
</p>
<p>excluding, occasional breakthroughs. The high standard of housekeeping and main-
</p>
<p>tenance, and the recording of performance data and identification of losses and their 
</p>
<p>causes, as promoted by TPM, provide a basis for the improvement of performance, of 
</p>
<p>quality and of reliability. In the production context, the potential for and methods of 
</p>
<p>improvement are well documented in works on TPM and Total Quality Control, such 
</p>
<p>as those of Hartmann, Ishikawa, and Suzuki listed in the references section. These 
</p>
<p>advantages should also be carried over to nonmanufacturing asset management situa-
</p>
<p>tions. Operations information regarding losses and data from inspections and routine 
</p>
<p>maintenance form an important source of knowledge regarding equipment condition. 
</p>
<p>This then forms a basis for improvements in performance and reliability of equip-
</p>
<p>ment and as a possible pointer toward equipment replacement. In forming a budget, 
</p>
<p>we should allow funding to encourage developments which can support continuous 
</p>
<p>improvement and which can emerge from any level of the business.
</p>
<p>18.5.1  Deming Wheel
</p>
<p>The cycle of continuous improvement is illustrated by the &ldquo;Deming wheel&rdquo; shown 
</p>
<p>in Fig. 18.3 Continuous Improvement Cycle. The wheel involves four steps known 
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55001 Clause 10.3 Continual improvement: &ldquo;The organization shall continually improve&hellip;&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>must be taken to ensure that changes are approved by technically qualified and 
</p>
<p>authorized persons before being implemented.
</p>
<p>18.5.2  Fish Bone Diagram (Ishikawa2)
</p>
<p>Another aid to continuous improvement is the systematic consideration of the fac-
</p>
<p>tors involved in a process. The &ldquo;fishbone&rdquo; diagram, of which a simplified version 
</p>
<p>is shown in Fig. 18.4, acts as a guide in relation to the various types of factors that 
</p>
<p>may be involved in an industrial process. Points to be considered are:
</p>

<p>18.6  Improvement Coordinator3
</p>
<p>An improvement coordinator is a person who acts as a focus for improvement 
</p>
<p>suggestions, receiving proposals, and assessing and progressing them. 
</p>
<p>Organizations can benefit from having an improvement coordinator (not usually 
</p>
<p>a full time commitment but something extra for an already busy person!) and a 
</p>
<p>standard form called a Workplace Problem Report. Anyone can originate a 
</p>
<p>Workplace Problem Report and send it to the Improvement Coordinator. An email 
</p>
<p>message is an alternative to the printed form. An example of a form is in Fig. 18.5.
</p>
<p>The Improvement Coordinator maintains a record of all Workplace Problem 
</p>
<p>Reports received, and acts as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Check problem and possible solutions with originator and relevant managers, 
</p>
<p>technical personnel, suppliers, etc.
</p>
<p>&bull; Initiate and monitor appropriate actions if any.
</p>
<p>&bull; Report on results. This should include cases where no action is taken, with 
</p>
<p>reasons.
</p>
<p>3 ISO 55001 Clause 10.1 Non-conformity and corrective action: &ldquo;When a nonconformity or 
incident occurs&hellip;the organization shall &hellip; react &hellip; take action &hellip; review &hellip; make changes if 
necessary&hellip;&rdquo;.

<p>312 18 Asset Basic Care
</p>
<p>18.7  Asset Basic Care/TPM&mdash;Management Support
</p>
<p>Maintenance must be recognized as important by senior managers and all 
</p>
<p>employees&mdash;the Plant Manager needs to commit to this. This recognition includes 
</p>
<p>ensuring that routine maintenance is carried out and is not neglected due to 
</p>
<p>pressure from operations staff or lack of maintenance budget.
</p>
<p>Management should assign specific equipment to specific operators or small 
</p>
<p>groups, giving them responsibility and empowerment. As an example, it is a 
</p>
<p>practice in the United States Air Force to assign management of each aircraft to an 
</p>
<p>individual. This individual follows the aircraft when it goes for servicing or repair 
</p>
<p>and ensures its security, integrity, and priority are maintained.
</p>
<p>Have a clear chain of technical expertize and use it. Do not remove all expertize 
</p>
<p>from a site. Have a fully functioning work request, job scoping, job planning, 
</p>
<p>work order, job scheduling, and progress/result reporting system.

<p>18.8  A Shock from Japan
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do after the war, Pop?&rdquo; Jock asked, on one of his weekly visits to 
</p>
<p>his grandad.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a few different jobs in the big car companies in and around 
</p>
<p>Birmingham,&rdquo; said Pop. &ldquo;The most interesting was later when all those Japanese 
</p>
<p>production methods hit us. I didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking about at first. 
</p>
<p>There was Just In Time and Kanbans and TPM. Our factory was near the original 
</p>
<p>site where James Watt and Matthew Boulton started building their steam engines 
</p>
<p>that kicked off the industrial revolution around 1789. The trouble was that no one 
</p>
<p>had tidied up for 200 years. There was an amazing amount of accumulated dirt, 
</p>
<p>dust, swarf, congealed oil and broken or reject castings in our machine shop.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d retired from production management by then and was assigned to &lsquo;con-
</p>
<p>tinuous improvement&rsquo;. I tried to change things in the machine shop but it was too 
</p>
<p>hard. Luckily we had an assembly area where most of the workers were women. 
</p>
<p>They quickly picked up on the idea of everything being clean and tidy and were 
</p>
<p>soon ahead of me, bringing in pot plants and feather dusters and stuff. Once the 
</p>
<p>other departments saw how nice and clean their assembly area was they got the 
</p>
<p>message. We took four big skips of rubbish out of the machine shop in 1 day.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that I got an assignment in a car lamp factory. I remember my first meeting 
</p>
<p>on the site. The new managing director was on a mission to boost production and 
</p>
<p>told the managers to get production up to one million lamps per month, &lsquo;or else&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a month later I came out on to the landing beside the offices which 
</p>
<p>looked over the production area. The partly finished lamps were moved around 
</p>
<p>in metal cages. The production area was solid with cages and the crane driver 
</p>
<p>had a cage on the crane and was looking for somewhere to put it down&mdash;but 
</p>
<p>there was no space left. Everything was jam-packed and production was at a 
</p>
<p>standstill!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luckily this crisis gave me an opportunity. For one thing, it was obvious that 
</p>
<p>setting a goal of producing one million lamps a month was dumb. The factory had 
</p>
<p>met the target by churning out lamps which were easy to make and disregarded 
</p>
<p>everything else, including the customers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got them to switch to a Kanban system where work centers had marked 
</p>
<p>spaces between them for holding inter-process stock. Once their &lsquo;output&rsquo; space 
</p>
<p>was filled, they stopped producing. The old hands said that they would never 
</p>
<p>achieve quota this way, but in fact sales increased. I was surprised myself. It 
</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense, but I found that, although the throughput of lamps 
</p>

<p>314 18 Asset Basic Care
</p>
<p>at particular work centers was less, this was more than offset by less rejects and 
</p>
<p>less re-work. Also, the kanbans ensured that we were making the lamps that the 
</p>
<p>customers wanted.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t seem to have taken much of it on board 
</p>
<p>in maintenance or in the mining and mineral processing industries that I&rsquo;ve seen. 
</p>
<p>Maintenance workshops always seem to look like your description of 20 years of 
</p>
<p>rubbish,&mdash;stockpiles of ore or tailings seem to build up all over the place. I may 
</p>
<p>be exaggerating a bit, but I think that there&rsquo;s a lot we can learn from the &lsquo;lean&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>techniques that you manufacturing blokes were using years ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>&mdash;Will Scott, Professor of Tribology,  
Queensland University of Technology
</p>
<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe the features and organizational 
</p>
<p>structure used in asset maintenance and to show how the maintenance budget can 
</p>
<p>be created and managed. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will be aware 
</p>
<p>of the main features of the maintenance function including maintenance technical 
</p>
<p>services, workflow management, and budgeting.
</p>
<p>19.1  Maintenance Aim
</p>
<p>The aim of maintenance is to deliver availability of machines and equipment to 
</p>
<p>production or service departments, within the envelope provided by underlying 
</p>
<p>machine condition and the available resources. Maintenance cannot convert a 
</p>
<p>10-year-old item into a new item, but it can sustain it in, or restore it to, a working 
</p>
<p>condition consistent with its age, provided that this is technically and resource 
</p>
<p>feasible.
</p>
<p>19.2  Maintenance Organization
</p>
<p>Logistic Support Analysis and Level of Repair Analysis as described in Chap. 17, 
</p>
<p>when aggregated across the asset portfolio, provide the basis for determining the 
</p>
<p>size and structure of the maintenance organization as a whole. In the case of a 
</p>
<p>substantial in-house maintenance organization, the structure will be as illustrated 
</p>
<p>in Fig. 19.1.
</p>
<p>Further detail of the maintenance services function is indicated in Fig. 19.2.

</p>
<p>19.2.1  Maintenance Layout
</p>
<p>A typical physical layout of a maintenance organization is shown schematically in 
</p>
<p>Fig. 19.3. At first line, this shows some maintenance personnel assigned to produc-
</p>
<p>tion areas A and B and some shown as supporting all areas. The split will depend 
</p>
<p>on whether the production locations are widely separated, or have similar or dif-
</p>
<p>ferent technology. Unless there are reasons to the contrary, it is advisable to have 
</p>
<p>most of the maintenance support placed centrally to support all areas as this pro-
</p>
<p>vides the most efficient use of the resources. Good planning, scheduling, and com-
</p>
<p>munications are important contributors to the efficiency of maintenance.

<p>19.3  Types of Maintenance Activity
</p>
<p>A number of terms are used to describe maintenance activities and are 
</p>
<p>summarized here. The categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive and some 
</p>
<p>overlap may occur.
</p>
<p>Routine Work carried out on a regular basis. Includes cleaning, lubrication, 
</p>
<p>inspection, servicing, condition monitoring.
</p>
<p>Emergency Action that must be carried out promptly in response to an urgent 
</p>
<p>situation, may or may not involve actual breakdown.
</p>
<p>Deferred Corrective work which can be carried out at a convenient time, in 
</p>
<p>contrast to &ldquo;emergency.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Preventive Maintenance Maintenance aimed at preventing failures. Lubrication, 
</p>
<p>servicing, component replacement on the basis of age or service time, such as an 
</p>
<p>oil change at 10,000 km, or aero-engine deeper maintenance after a prescribed 
</p>
<p>number of flying hours.
</p>
<p>Predictive Maintenance Maintenance aimed at predicting potential failures and 
</p>
<p>taking action to avoid in-service failure. Condition monitoring.
</p>
<p>Corrective Maintenance Maintenance to correct known faults. May be 
</p>
<p>Emergency or Deferred. Covers all activities other than routine. Includes activity 
</p>
<p>carried out following conditions identified by reporting, inspection, condition 
</p>
<p>monitoring, or breakdown
</p>
<p>Breakdown Failure of an item or system occurs
</p>
<p>Nonbreakdown Failure of an item or system does not occur, but action is

<p>19.3 Types of Maintenance Activity</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>320 19 Maintenance Organization and Budget
</p>
<p>Scheduled Maintenance Maintenance which is part of a planned schedule. Can 
</p>
<p>include routine maintenance, deferred corrective maintenance and shutdowns. 
</p>
<p>Distinct from emergency maintenance.
</p>
<p>Proactive Maintenance Root cause analysis and improvement activities.
</p>
<p>Irregular Cyclic Maintenance is maintenance activity which can be expected to 
</p>
<p>recur, though not in a strictly scheduled way. These activities may be triggered by 
</p>
<p>normal observation or by condition monitoring.
</p>
<p>Examples are the replacement of:
</p>
<p>&bull; tires
</p>
<p>&bull; engines
</p>
<p>&bull; batteries
</p>
<p>&bull; exhaust systems
</p>
<p>Maintenance budgeting should allow for these activities, which will be ongoing 
</p>
<p>and can produce significant but irregular costs.
</p>
<p>19.3.1  Additional Related Tasks
</p>
<p>It is common to find that the resources of maintenance are also drawn on for 
</p>
<p>related tasks such as;
</p>
<p>&bull; Rebuilds
</p>
<p>&bull; Turnarounds
</p>
<p>&bull; Modifications
</p>
<p>&bull; Installation of new equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Investigations
</p>
<p>&bull; Special functions or occasions
</p>
<p>It is advisable to schedule all these activities in the same resource planning 
</p>
<p>schedule in the Asset Management Information System or CMMS. This will 
</p>
<p>provide for a balanced assessment of workloads and priorities.
</p>

<p>costing, and budgetary management.
</p>
<p>19.4.1  Inspection and Scoping
</p>

<p>19.4.2  Planning and Costing
</p>
<p>Planning is the process of identifying all the resources required to carry out a 
</p>
<p>maintenance task. This includes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Trades and technical personnel to perform the task
</p>
<p>&bull; Materials and spare parts requirements
</p>
<p>&bull; Special tools and equipment required
</p>
<p>&bull; Support service requirements such as scaffolding or hire equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Documentation, drawings, technical information required.
</p>
<p>The output from the planning process is a Work Order containing all the above 
</p>
<p>details and supporting documentation combined together to form a Work Pack for 
</p>
<p>the task. At this stage the job is costed and approved as necessary.
</p>
<p>19.4.3  Scheduling
</p>
<p>The maintenance schedule defines when maintenance work will be done. Work 
</p>
<p>will be included in the schedule on the basis of priority. Work will not be included 
</p>
<p>in the schedule until it has been adequately specified by the maintenance planner.
</p>
<p>Maintenance work schedules are normally produced weekly and confirmed 
</p>
<p>prior to the start of the schedule commencement date. Except in the cases of an 
</p>
<p>immediate priority (breakdown), the contents of schedules will only be changed 
</p>
<p>by agreement between the relevant operations and the maintenance managers.
</p>
<p>19.4.4  Maintenance Control
</p>
<p>Maintenance and engineering related work is documented on work orders. All rel-
</p>
<p>evant work should be managed on the one work order system. Work Orders pro-
</p>
<p>vide a basis for:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification and tracking of jobs
</p>
<p>&bull; Work authorization and approval
</p>
<p>&bull; Work planning and assignment of job responsibility and resource utilization.
</p>
<p>&bull; Assignment and tracking of spare parts and materials
</p>
<p>&bull; Collection of equipment history and failure data for analysis.

<p>326 19 Maintenance Organization and Budget
</p>
<p>19.5  Maintenance Budgeting
</p>
<p>19.5.1  The Business Plan
</p>
<p>The starting point for maintenance budgeting is the business plan. In a mining opera-
</p>
<p>tion, for example, the business plan will provide a production plan at each mine, and 
</p>
<p>will give a planned number of tonnes of material to be moved in the year, in vari-
</p>
<p>ous categories such as overburden, ore, and processed material of various types. The 
</p>
<p>plan will often be structurally similar to that for the previous year, but the quantities 
</p>
<p>will vary to a greater or lesser degree. An increase or decrease in the mined and pro-
</p>
<p>cessed quantities will affect the maintenance workload, as will variations in such fac-
</p>
<p>tors as the distance from the ore body to the processing units. In addition to the basic 
</p>
<p>processes there will be many subsidiary activities which must be taken into account.
</p>
<p>The fact that changes from year to year are often marginal is both a blessing 
</p>
<p>and a curse. It is a blessing in that the maintenance workload, and hence the main-
</p>
<p>tenance budget may then be derived by marginal changes, but it is a curse in that 
</p>
<p>a considerable drift in the maintenance resources from those actually required can 
</p>
<p>occur over time. Indeed, it is not uncommon to find that quite drastic changes in 
</p>
<p>the maintenance workload by quantity and type have not been responded to in the 
</p>
<p>maintenance budgeting process.
</p>
<p>19.5.2  Zero-Based Budgeting
</p>
<p>Zero-based budgeting is calculating a budget from first principles based on the 
</p>
<p>current requirements of the business. In this approach, every item of the budget 
</p>
<p>must be justified from first principles. During a pure zero-based budgeting pro-
</p>
<p>cess, no reference is made to the previous level of expenditure. This is in contrast 
</p>
<p>to incremental budgeting which focusses on variances from past years, based on 
</p>
<p>the assumption that the baseline is approximately correct.
</p>
<p>1. Each week the scheduler produces a schedule of work for the 
</p>
<p>following week.
</p>
<p>2. Assuming a week of Monday to Sunday, the schedule is 
</p>
<p>produced on Thursday for the following week.  
</p>
<p>3. There is daily feedback on the schedule. The scheduler
</p>
<p>provides updates where needed but schedule stability is 
</p>
<p>regarded as of considerable importance. 
</p>
<p>4. Some work will usually carry over into the next week.
</p>
<p>5. The scheduler takes jobs on a basis of priority, drawing 
</p>
<p>primarily from the available-to-do work in the backlog, and  
</p>
<p>adds them into the schedule, until the available resources are 
</p>
<p>committed.
</p>
<p>Fig. 19.9  Weekly scheduling process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>327
</p>
<p>19.5.2.1  Reasons for Zero-Based Budgeting
</p>
<p>The reason for zero-based budgeting is that incremental budgeting can fail to keep 
</p>
<p>up with changes in the business or the technology. Such changes may affect the 
</p>
<p>workload by trades, by location and by operational requirements, and also create a 
</p>
<p>need for capital equipment changes.
</p>
<p>19.5.2.2  Limitations of Zero-Based Budgeting
</p>
<p>Zero-based budgeting would seem to be the most logical way to form a budget. 
</p>
<p>However, zero-based budgeting relies on the assumption that the needs of the 
</p>
<p>business can be accurately assessed from first principles at every stage of the 
</p>
<p>budgeting process. The end result may be that an essential item or service is 
</p>
<p>missed or grossly over or underrepresented.
</p>
<p>On balance we should always be alert to the need for a zero-based approach to any 
</p>
<p>item, but should be sure to fully evaluate the possible reasons for the previous budget 
</p>
<p>allocations and also take note of the &ldquo;maintenance iceberg&rdquo; visible later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>19.5.3  Creating the Budget
</p>
<p>The basic logic is summarized in Fig. 19.10.
</p>
<p>The first step in Fig. 19.10, the production plan by type and quantity, must be 
</p>
<p>provided by operations as part of the overall operational planning process. In Step 2 
</p>
<p>of Fig. 19.10, the maintenance budgeter analyzes the production plan to determine 
</p>
<p>the corresponding machine requirements. The service level required by the business 
</p>
<p>plan is a factor in determining the machine requirements. For example, in a railway 
</p>
<p>operation, the timetabling plan will determine the required numbers of trains and 
</p>
<p>this in turn will determine the availability level needed from the train fleet.
</p>
<p>In Step 3 of Fig. 19.10 we determine the maintenance workload in order 
</p>
<p>to meet the planned machine availability. This should be done as part of the 
</p>
<p>total planning process. The success of the production plan will be dependent 
</p>
<p>1. Production Plan by Type and Quantity
</p>
<p>2. Machine Requirements and Service Level to meet the
Production Plan
</p>
<p>3. Maintenance Requirements by Type and Quantity
</p>
<p>4. Maintenance Budget $, Scaled to Plan
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>328 19 Maintenance Organization and Budget
</p>
<p>on the ability of maintenance to service it, and the implications of the plan for 
</p>
<p>maintenance physical and financial resources must be taken into account. The 
</p>
<p>process continues over the range of maintainable assets, summarized to major 
</p>
<p>blocks, with considerations of criticality, service level and required availabil-
</p>
<p>ity. Finally, the maintenance plan is used as a basis for creating the mainte-
</p>
<p>nance budget.
</p>
<p>19.5.4  Using the History
</p>
<p>Useful reference points at this stage are the operational loss data and work 
</p>
<p>order data from the previous year. By analyzing operational loss data as an 
</p>
<p>indicator of shortfalls in the past (such as canceled trains), and the work order 
</p>
<p>data by trade, equipment, and location we can establish maintenance load 
</p>
<p>per machine hour and in total. To be able to use the history data in this way, 
</p>
<p>we must have been tough about requiring all operational performance data 
</p>
<p>and maintenance jobs and hours to be reported. The analysis may make use 
</p>
<p>of Pareto charts and pie charts to highlight where and how operational losses 
</p>
<p>occurred and where maintenance money has been spent. This can turn up sur-
</p>
<p>prises, as the work done in particular areas may well be considerably out of 
</p>
<p>kilter with expectations and with allocated resources. The operational loss 
</p>
<p>data is useful as an indicator of achieved availability, and as an aid to focus-
</p>
<p>sing on loss reduction, to help justify the budget to operations and to senior 
</p>
<p>management.
</p>
<p>19.5.5  Walking Around
</p>
<p>In addition to data analysis it is important to see the situation on the ground, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly in regard to backlogs and equipment condition. Local management 
</p>
<p>should be able to pinpoint areas of required capacity or surplus capacity on the 
</p>
<p>basis of direct experience. Of course, local management will wish to have a gener-
</p>
<p>ous allowance of resources and this must be aimed off for.
</p>
<p>19.5.6  Backlog
</p>
<p>Maintenance backlog is work which is either overdue or which is required to be 
</p>
<p>done but has not yet been started. It is normal to have a moderate amount of back-
</p>
<p>log, particularly in regard to deferred corrective work which can be scheduled at 
</p>
<p>a convenient time or on an opportunistic basis. However, excessive backlog is a 
</p>
<p>danger sign in regard to the maintenance function. The budgeting process should 
</p>
<p>allow for catching up with excessive backlog.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>329
</p>
<p>19.5.7  Sources of Maintenance Work
</p>
<p>In developing the maintenance requirements consider the sources of maintenance 
</p>
<p>work such as the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Routine servicing
</p>
<p>&bull; Routine maintenance, e.g., inspect/check/adjust
</p>
<p>&bull; Corrective work arising at first line
</p>
<p>&bull; Existing backlog
</p>
<p>&bull; Condition monitoring
</p>
<p>&bull; Corrective work at second line (workshop) following from inspections
</p>
<p>&bull; Breakdowns and work requests. Subsequent repair/replace at first line
</p>
<p>&bull; Breakdowns and work requests. Subsequent repair/replace at workshop level
</p>
<p>&bull; Field repair teams if separate from previous categories
</p>
<p>&bull; Job scoping, costing, planning, and scheduling
</p>
<p>&bull; Technical supervision and support at tools level
</p>
<p>&bull; Technical support at engineer and specialist technician level including trouble-
</p>
<p>shooting and reliability improvement
</p>
<p>&bull; Proactive maintenance, e.g., failure analysis, root cause analysis, conditioning 
</p>
<p>monitoring development
</p>
<p>&bull; Data entry
</p>
<p>&bull; Data management, setup, analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Modifications
</p>
<p>&bull; Installation and commissioning
</p>
<p>&bull; De-commissioning and disposal.
</p>
<p>&bull; Shutdowns/turnarounds, overhauls planning
</p>
<p>&bull; Shutdowns/turnarounds, overhauls implementation and management
</p>
<p>&bull; Ancillary and miscellaneous work&mdash;e.g., painting the Brownies&rsquo; toadstools
</p>
<p>&bull; Personnel management
</p>
<p>&bull; Training
</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to and from site and work locations
</p>
<p>&bull; Spares and tools acquisition.
</p>
<p>19.5.8  Changes in Demand
</p>
<p>The considerations just outlined provide a basis for estimating demand for main-
</p>
<p>tenance resources in the planning period. In practice much depends on how exten-
</p>
<p>sively the workload has changed from the current year and on how accurate we 
</p>
<p>regard the current year&rsquo;s budget in the first place. If the workload has changed little 
</p>
<p>and the current budget is seen as accurate, then minimal changes will be needed.
</p>
<p>Changes to the level of equipment supported must be taken into account. For 
</p>
<p>example, if 10 trucks work eight shifts per week this year, and 14 trucks will be 
</p>
<p>working 10 shifts per week next year, then the budget should increase in pro-
</p>
<p>portion. In the case of increased workload those carrying out the work can be 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>330 19 Maintenance Organization and Budget
</p>
<p>expected to be vocal, but if the workload decreases, they are unlikely to mention it. 
</p>
<p>It is up to management to identify the need for budgetary changes where workload 
</p>
<p>had decreased, and to make the corresponding adjustments.
</p>
<p>19.5.9  Direct Labor Estimates&mdash;Routine
</p>
<p>The requirement for direct labor for routine maintenance can be estimated from 
</p>
<p>the labor content and frequencies of particular routine maintenance activities. 
</p>
<p>Figure 19.11 illustrates this.
</p>
<p>19.5.10  Nonroutine and Breakdown Labor Estimate
</p>
<p>The labor requirement for nonroutine work, which includes emergency breakdown 
</p>
<p>and deferred nonroutine work, is estimated by reference to history, changes in 
</p>
<p>forecast demand and by judgment. Additionally, breakdown costs can be estimated 
</p>
<p>by considering the major failure modes, the mean time between such failures and 
</p>
<p>the labor requirements per failure. The failures referred to here may combine 
</p>
<p>chance events with cyclic events such as major assembly changes, the need for 
</p>
<p>which can be predicted in broad terms, although the exact time of occurrence will 
</p>
<p>not be known in advance. Figure 19.12 shows an example of nonroutine labor esti-
</p>
<p>mates for the various areas of a large mining shovel.
</p>

<p>331
</p>
<p>19.5.11  Specific Items
</p>
<p>We then make estimates of the workloads by trades and other roles for specific 
</p>
<p>activities such as those shown in Fig. 19.13.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>332 19 Maintenance Organization and Budget
</p>
<p>19.5.12  In-direct Labor
</p>
<p>In-direct labor covers supervision, administration, training, stores, and technical 
</p>
<p>personnel. Requirement for indirect labor must be estimated. Typically, there will 
</p>
<p>be about 4 indirect positions per 10 direct positions. Examples of in-direct labor 
</p>
<p>activities are,
</p>
<p>&bull; Supervision
</p>
<p>&bull; Technical administration
</p>
<p>&bull; General administration
</p>
<p>&bull; Training
</p>
<p>&bull; Induction, safety
</p>
<p>&bull; Systems development, e.g., Asset Management Information System implementation
</p>
<p>&bull; Documentation development and maintenance
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment appraisal for acquisition, replacement
</p>
<p>&bull; Failure analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Subcontractor management.
</p>
<p>19.5.13  Overheads
</p>
<p>Identify requirements for facilities and working and office space, consumables, 
</p>
<p>telephone costs, and support for general administrative functions.
</p>
<p>19.5.14  The Maintenance Iceberg
</p>
<p>Many things in maintenance remain hard to quantify. For this reason, a zero-based 
</p>
<p>budgeting approach, that is working the budget out by estimating the work to be 
</p>
<p>done from first principles, is less effective than one would wish. Factors in the 
</p>
<p>hard-to-quantify category include,
</p>
<p>&bull; Peaking of workloads for valid operational reasons
</p>
<p>&bull; Standby capacity to cover emergencies
</p>
<p>&bull; Standby capacity to mitigate against potential expensive downtime of key 
</p>
<p>equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to and from jobs
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquiring and awaiting spares and consumables
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquiring tools and instruments
</p>
<p>&bull; Awaiting the completion of preceding work
</p>
<p>&bull; Subcontractor liaison, communication, management
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquiring permits
</p>
<p>&bull; Awaiting inspections</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>333
</p>
<p>&bull; Accessing documentation
</p>
<p>&bull; Gaining access to equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Delays in bringing mixed trades together
</p>
<p>&bull; In-job training
</p>
<p>&bull; Diagnostics
</p>
<p>&bull; Resolving technical snags
</p>
<p>&bull; Obtaining technical advice
</p>
<p>&bull; Absenteeism
</p>
<p>&bull; Weather delays
</p>
<p>&bull; Seasonal variations
</p>
<p>&bull; Nonmaintenance activities of maintenance people
</p>
<p>&bull; Operator degree of care. Expensive consumables which can be wasted by care-
</p>
<p>less operators should be moved to the production budget. Examples are tires, 
</p>
<p>bucket teeth, ground engaging tools.
</p>
<p>The marginal value of changes in the maintenance budget is hard to quantify on 
</p>
<p>the downside as well as on the upside. Given more money, technical people can 
</p>
<p>always find a use for it. On the other hand, the accountants&rsquo; tendency to try to 
</p>
<p>increase profits simply by making across the board percentage cuts can only work 
</p>
<p>up to a point.
</p>
<p>19.5.15  Arrive at the Resource Requirement
</p>
<p>From the steps given in this section, arrive at a required capacity for each resource 
</p>
<p>at each line of repair and at each location. The following categories of staff will 
</p>
<p>typically be required:
</p>
<p>&bull; Tradesmen
</p>
<p>&ndash; Mechanical
</p>
<p>&ndash; Electrical
</p>
<p>&ndash; Civil, building, rigging
</p>
<p>&ndash; Instrument, air conditioning, etc.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Laborers
</p>
<p>&bull; Planners
</p>
<p>&bull; Storemen
</p>
<p>&bull; Inspectors
</p>
<p>&bull; Supervisors
</p>
<p>&bull; Engineering and technical support personnel
</p>
<p>&bull; Clerical staff
</p>
<p>&bull; Managers
</p>
<p>&bull; Data systems support staff
</p>
<p>&bull; Contractors.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>334 19 Maintenance Organization and Budget
</p>
<p>19.5.16  Correct the Imbalances
</p>
<p>Organizations may find that they have evolved into a situation where the work-
</p>
<p>force is out of balance with needs in terms of numbers, skills, flexibility, and loca-
</p>
<p>tion. Take a hard look for imbalances between current maintenance capacity and 
</p>
<p>planned workload. Relate required work to required capacity by:
</p>
<p>&bull; Location
</p>
<p>&bull; Trade
</p>
<p>&bull; Shift
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment type
</p>
<p>Where imbalances occur&mdash;and they may not be small imbalances&mdash;reassign, reduce, or 
</p>
<p>increase capacity. Correct the gross imbalances. Putting this another way, it means that 
</p>
<p>while a totally zero-based budget approach may have its limitations, it is still good to be 
</p>
<p>able to take a zero-based viewpoint in particular areas where there is reason to regard 
</p>
<p>the resources as significantly out of balance. Build the result into the next year&rsquo;s budget.
</p>
<p>19.6  Costing
</p>
<p>The accounting department will help in converting the resource budget into a 
</p>
<p>financial budget. This will involve identifying the cost rate for various labor 
</p>
<p>categories including on-costs, such as,
</p>
<p>&bull; holiday pay,
</p>
<p>&bull; sick pay,
</p>
<p>&bull; payroll tax
</p>
<p>&bull; workplace insurance
</p>
<p>&bull; superannuation.
</p>
<p>In-direct, operating, and overhead costs must then be added for such categories as,
</p>
<p>&bull; Vehicles,
</p>
<p>&bull; Tools and equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Spares
</p>
<p>&bull; Consumables
</p>
<p>&bull; Freight
</p>
<p>&bull; Rent
</p>
<p>&bull; Rates
</p>
<p>&bull; Electricity and gas
</p>
<p>&bull; Telephone
</p>
<p>&bull; Facilities maintenance
</p>
<p>&bull; Insurance
</p>
<p>&bull; Office consumables
</p>
<p>&bull; Depreciation.</p>

</p>
<p>When in-direct costs and overheads are taken into account it is not unusual to find 
</p>
<p>that the total cost of maintenance is in the region of six times the wages cost of the 
</p>
<p>direct labor.
</p>
<p>19.7  Survey and Quote
</p>
<p>When a major item needs extensive work, a Survey and Quote approach can be 
</p>
<p>used. The extent of work needed is assessed, possibly involving some disassembly, 
</p>
<p>and a scope of work is determined. This is then costed and included in the budget. 
</p>
<p>There must be adequate allowance for contingencies and for materials and 
</p>
<p>overheads. The survey and quote and the subsequent work are often outsourced.
</p>
<p>19.8  Budget Cost Control
</p>
<p>1. Create a budget in a spreadsheet (or other established system) indicating the var-
</p>
<p>ious cost categories and the amounts allocated. Figure 19.14 shows an example.
</p>
<p>2. Record actual expenditure year to date (YTD) as it occurs.
</p>
<p>3. Calculate planned expenditure for rest of year (ROY). In the absence of other 
</p>
<p>information, this can be done as a proportion of the original budget, but it 
</p>
<p>should be adjusted to allow for known factors of future expenditure. These may 
</p>
<p>be increases or reductions relative to the original plan.

<p>336 19 Maintenance Organization and Budget
</p>
<p>4. Calculate &ldquo;uncommitted&rdquo; money = Budget &minus; (ActualYTD + PlannedROY). 
</p>
<p>This will be a positive amount if there is a projected budget surplus and a nega-
</p>
<p>tive amount if there is a projected budget shortfall.
</p>
<p>5. Take steps to remain within budget, or discuss the situation with management if 
</p>
<p>an unavoidable shortfall or surplus is emerging.
</p>
<p>Figure 19.15 shows the budget monitoring process in graphical form. The expend-
</p>
<p>iture planned in the budget is shown as the straight line (though in practice a vari-
</p>
<p>able slope may apply if expenditure over the year was not expected to be uniform). 
</p>
<p>As time goes by the actual cumulative expenditure is plotted and the estimated 
</p>
<p>cumulative is also shown, indicating projected expenditure in relation to budget.
</p>
<p>19.9  Budget Reports
</p>
<p>The following budget reports should be created and monitored on a regular basis, 
</p>
<p>such as monthly.
</p>
<p>1. Actual versus planned expenditure to date.
</p>
<p>2. Estimated commitments versus remaining budget, giving projected underspend 
</p>
<p>or overspend.
</p>
<p>3. Risk analysis, i.e., significant costs which may occur, and also contingency 
</p>
<p>which may not be required.
</p>
<p>4. Informally, finance likes a realistic assessment of how much money will 
</p>
<p>be needed. An overspend is a problem, but an underspend also needs to be 
</p>
<p>addressed, and may relieve problems in other areas. Underspending often 
</p>
<p>occurs due to delays in acquisition of items.
</p>
<p>5. Although not specifically a budget report, backlogs in maintenance activity 
</p>
<p>should be reported and monitored as part of the budget management process.
</p>
<p>It is important to react in response to the information provided by the reports. 
</p>
<p>Budget changes may be required due to significant changes in commitments.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>337
</p>
<p>Backlogs should be acted upon, either by increasing resources in backlog areas 
</p>
<p>or reducing resources if backlogs disappear. Contingency allowances should be 
</p>
<p>retired if risks do not eventuate. Do not cry wolf but be prepared to make a bal-
</p>
<p>anced statement regarding risk. Use the unfolding information to refine the budget 
</p>
<p>for next year.
</p>
<p>19.10  Activity-Based Costing
</p>
<p>Activity-based costing means relating costs for a product, service, or machine 
</p>
<p>closely to the activities needed to support it. This is in contrast to a broad brush 
</p>
<p>approach which allocates overheads in proportion to direct labor, even when a par-
</p>
<p>ticular overhead may not apply to a particular activity. Activity-based costing is a 
</p>
<p>way of accurately allocating of overheads to the activity they are used on, and not 
</p>
<p>to others.
</p>
<p>In activity-based costing we
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify the &ldquo;cost drivers&rdquo; of each activity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Relate costs, and hence budgets and prices for these activities to the drivers.
</p>
<p>19.10.1  Examples
</p>
<p>In a certain plant, some food products require the use of high pressure steam 
</p>
<p>generated by a boiler system. The boiler system is a cost driver for those products 
</p>
<p>and should be taken into account when estimating their cost.
</p>
<p>If activity-based costing is not applied, the cost of the boiler system might be 
</p>
<p>spread over the whole plant (e.g., by absorbing the cost as a general overhead), 
</p>
<p>wrongly inflating the cost of products which make no use of the boiler system. 
</p>
<p>This can make those products appear noncompetitive with rival products in the 
</p>
<p>market place which are not carrying the irrelevant overhead.
</p>
<p>Internal invoicing between cost centers can provide a mechanism for assist-
</p>
<p>ing with activity-based costing. For example, in a power station which is close 
</p>
<p>to a river it is important to monitor the stability of the foundations of the build-
</p>
<p>ings. Initially, the workgroup monitoring stability of foundations was regarded 
</p>
<p>as a general overhead. When internal invoicing was introduced, the monitoring 
</p>
<p>workgroup invoiced the maintenance workshop for monitoring their founda-
</p>
<p>tions. The maintenance workshop was in an area that was not subject to insta-
</p>
<p>bility and did not have its foundations monitored. They refused to pay and 
</p>
<p>their refusal was upheld by senior management. Had they been required to pay 
</p>
<p>for the monitoring of foundations as a general overhead, it would have arti-
</p>
<p>ficially inflated their costs and made it hard for them to compete for outside 
</p>
<p>work.

</p>
<p>available for the current year (Table 19.1).
</p>
<p>The direct labor cost rate is $30 per hour with a multiplier for on-costs and 
</p>
<p>overheads of 2.75. For the next year an increase in activity of 24 % has been fore-

</p>
<p>1. What is the aim of maintenance?
</p>
<p> The aim of maintenance is to deliver availability of machines and equipment to 
</p>
<p>production or service departments, within the envelope provided by underlying 
</p>
<p>machine condition and the available maintenance resources.
</p>
<p>2. Describe the following types of maintenance activity?
</p>
<p> Note These types of activity are not necessarily mutually exclusive, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, condition monitoring is typically &ldquo;predictive&rdquo; and &ldquo;routine.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> a.  Routine Work carried out on a regular basis. Includes cleaning, lubrication, 
</p>
<p>inspection, servicing, condition monitoring.
</p>
<p> b.  Emergency Action that must be carried out promptly in response to an 
</p>
<p>urgent situation, may or may not involve actual breakdown.
</p>
<p> c.  Deferred Corrective work which can be carried out at a convenient time, in 
</p>
<p>contrast to &ldquo;emergency.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> d.  Preventive Maintenance aimed at preventing failures. Lubrication, servic-
</p>
<p>ing, etc.
</p>
<p> e.  Predictive Maintenance aimed at predicting potential failures. Condition 
</p>
<p>monitoring.
</p>
<p> f.  Corrective Maintenance to correct known faults. May be Emergency or 
</p>
<p>Deferred. Covers all activities other than routine. Includes activity carried out fol-
</p>
<p>lowing conditions identified by reporting, inspection, monitoring, or breakdown.
</p>
<p> g. Proactive Root cause analysis and improvement activities.
</p>
<p>3. What is zero-based budgeting?
</p>
<p> Zero-based budgeting is calculating a budget from first principles based on the 
</p>
<p>current requirements of the business. In this approach, every item of the budget 
</p>
<p>must be justified from first principles. During a pure zero-based budgeting 
</p>
<p>process, no reference is made to the previous level of expenditure. This is in 
</p>
<p>contrast to incremental budgeting which focusses on variances from past years 
</p>
<p>based on the assumption that the baseline is approximately correct.

<p>5. What is backlog and what part does it play in budgeting?
</p>
<p> Maintenance backlog is work which is either overdue or which is required to

</p>
<p> b. Record actual expenditure as it occurs.
</p>
<p> c.  Calculate planned expenditure for rest of the year. There may be increases

<p>Abstract  The aim of this chapter is to describe the various aspects of inventory 
</p>
<p>management required for asset management. This starts from the initial purchase 
</p>
<p>of spare parts and consumables, and continues with through-life support. Inventory 
</p>
<p>control methods are presented for routine demands and for fast and slow mov-
</p>
<p>ing spares and insurance spares. Outcomes After reading this chapter, you will be 
</p>
<p>aware of the main issues that confront asset managers in regard to spare parts and 
</p>
<p>consumables inventory. You will know everything that is worth knowing about 
</p>
<p>spare parts inventory management, but this will not mean that you can solve all the 
</p>
<p>problems.
</p>
<p>20.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>The term inventory is applied to stocks of items such as finished goods, work-in-
</p>
<p>process materials, consumables, and spare parts held by an organization in order 
</p>
<p>to carry out its business functions. The management of inventory extends to cover 
</p>
<p>items which are on-order and are known as dues in, and items which are required 
</p>
<p>by users but not yet available from the store, which are known as dues out, as well 
</p>
<p>as to those items which are physically in stock at any given moment. In the asset 
</p>
<p>management area, the items involved are typically:
</p>
<p>&bull; Consumables such as fuel, oil, lubricants, and chemicals.
</p>
<p>&bull; Spare parts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Rotables, which are items that are changed out, then repaired, and returned to 
</p>
<p>store; this may include complete equipments.
</p>
<p>&bull; Insurance spares, that is items which we may never need but which we prefer 
</p>
<p>not to risk being without.

</p>
<p>20.2  Aims of Inventory Management
</p>
<p>The primary aim of inventory management in the field of spares and consumables 
</p>
<p>is to enable the meeting of requirements for equipment availability at minimum 
</p>
<p>overall cost. This will involve:
</p>
<p>&bull; Keeping service to the users at a reasonably high level
</p>
<p>&bull; Keeping inventory investment reasonably low
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost-effective purchasing.
</p>
<p>A balance must be struck between these conflicting factors.
</p>
<p>More basic aims of inventory management are to ensure that:
</p>
<p>&bull; Stock identity, quantity, and location are known;
</p>
<p>&bull; Stock is secure;
</p>
<p>&bull; Items are available and accessible when required;
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchase orders are placed promptly;
</p>
<p>&bull; Goods are received and checked efficiently and effectively.
</p>
<p>20.3  Initial Spares Purchase
</p>
<p>When a new equipment is acquired, we normally purchase an initial quantity of 
</p>
<p>spare parts. This may be based on the manufacturer's recommended spares list, 
</p>
<p>or on input from experienced maintainers. The acquisition budget should include 
</p>
<p>funding for the initial spares purchase. An amount in the range of 5&ndash;10 % of the 
</p>
<p>main equipment budget is typically allocated. The initial purchase or &ldquo;scaling&rdquo; is 
</p>
<p>based on a planning horizon such as 3 years. Major spares, such as replacement 
</p>
<p>engines and gearboxes, which may go out of production by the time they are 
</p>
<p>needed, should also be included. It is hard to get it right on forecasting demand 
</p>
<p>and some over and under supply must be expected.
</p>
<p>20.4  Cataloguing
</p>
<p>Parts will be identified by means of a part number within the organization&rsquo;s inven-
</p>
<p>tory management system. It is therefore necessary to catalog the items which the 
</p>
<p>organization will hold. An agreed system of codification will need to be adopted. 
</p>
<p>The equipment manufacturer will normally provide a parts list for spare parts 
</p>
<p>which will include parts explosion diagrams and part numbers. However, if these 
</p>
<p>are to be incorporated into a company inventory system, it will be necessary to 
</p>
<p>catalog the parts under the company&rsquo;s part numbering system. The computer 
</p>
<p>record will normally also contain the identification of the manufacturer and the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>345
</p>
<p>manufacturer&rsquo;s part number. Resources will be needed for the cataloguing activity 
</p>
<p>and for maintaining the computerized inventory management system.
</p>
<p>20.5  Inventory Management Basics
</p>
<p>A flowchart of inventory transactions is shown in Fig. 20.1. Inventory management 
</p>
<p>is invariably based on a computer system and will be part of an Asset Management 
</p>
<p>Information or Computerized Maintenance Management System. Knowing the 
</p>
<p>current status of any given item requires a comprehensive, online transaction pro-
</p>
<p>cessing, inventory management information system. Up-to-date and accurate infor-
</p>
<p>mation is more valuable than any theory.
</p>
<p>The following points are counsels of perfection for inventory management.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have one person responsible for the inventory management system.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide an adequate computer system and personnel for system support.
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain security, particularly in regard to attractive items.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have an effective coding and cataloguing system with unique part numbers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain stores accuracy in regard to quantities, locations, and item descriptions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish bills of materials and where-used data.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure work orders contain all spares and materials required for the job.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish and use strict procedures for receival and issue of stores.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have a system which allows 24/7 access to spares for urgent maintenance jobs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish and use strict procedures for the timely reordering of stock.
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain the computer system in regard to updating supplier and stock records. 
</p>
<p>Ensure staffing is adequate to sustain this.
</p>
<p>&bull; Carry out regular stock-takes, usually on a cyclic basis.
</p>
<p>&bull; Make stores records visible to users. Extend this company-wide, and have a 
</p>
<p>transfer system between locations.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish data for average demand and for specific project demands.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish item criticality. Have a system for keeping this information up-to-date.
</p>
<p>&bull; Set reorder parameters.
</p>
<p>&bull; Eliminate dead stock.
</p>
<p>&bull; For fast moving items, establish Just In Time delivery procedures.

</p>
<p>20.5.1  Stock Keeping Units or SKUs
</p>
<p>An SKU is a point at which a given item is stocked. A company may have 10,000 
</p>
<p>different types of item in inventory, but some of them may be held in more than 
</p>
<p>one place. So if the main store is in Melbourne and it holds all 10,000 types of 
</p>
<p>item and there is a subsidiary store in Upper Wup Wup which only holds a subset, 
</p>
<p>say 4,000 types of item, then the company has 14,000 SKUs. The number of SKUs 
</p>
<p>gives a measure of the total size of the inventory management side of the business.

<p>Basic elements of spare parts data for engineering equipment are the spare parts 
</p>
<p>explosion diagram and spare parts catalog listing, examples of which are shown in 
</p>
<p>Figs. 20.2 and 20.3.
</p>
<p>20.6  Procedure When an Item Is Needed
</p>
<p>The basic steps involved when an item is needed from inventory are as follows:
</p>
<p>a. An item is needed;
</p>
<p>b. Get the part number. Refer to the spare parts explosion diagram and the catalog;
</p>
<p>c. Is the item in stock?
</p>
<p>d. If so, where is it? Pick the item from the location;
</p>
<p>e. Follow the issue procedure, documenting the issue;
</p>
<p>f. Do more items need to be ordered? This will be the case if there is insufficient 
</p>
<p>in stock, or if the withdrawal takes the stock level below the reorder point;
</p>
<p>g. If so, how many should be ordered? The order quantity may have been set in the 
</p>
<p>inventory system, but enough should be ordered to cover foreseen requirements;
</p>
<p>h. Follow the reorder procedure. Get the supplier details. Initiate a purchase order;
</p>
<p>i. If the supplier is not already in the system an entry must be created.
</p>
<p>20.7  Stock Status and Control Terminology
</p>
<p>To find out if the item is in stock we will refer to a computer screen similar to that 
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 20.4.

<p>348 Stock Control
</p>
<p>In Fig. 20.4 the following terms are used, and play the roles indicated as 
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>Current Stock Level The number of items in stock.
</p>
<p>Dues In Items ordered from a supplier but not yet delivered.
</p>
<p>Dues Out Items demanded by a user, but not yet issued.
</p>
<p>Dues out can include items not yet ordered from a supplier, items ordered from a 
</p>
<p>supplier but not yet received, and items received but not yet issued. These items may be 
</p>
<p>referred to as &ldquo;committed,&rdquo; as they are already known to be demanded by specific users.
</p>
<p>Lead Time Days The time between ordering and delivery.
</p>
<p>Net Level Current Stock Level + Dues In &minus; Dues Out.
</p>
<p>The net level is the stock level that we shall have if we add the dues in to our 
</p>
<p>existing stock and then subtract the dues out. It is the balance of our stock situa-
</p>
<p>tion allowing for existing planned stock movements. If the result is below the reor-
</p>
<p>der level, an order for the reorder quantity should be placed.
</p>
<p>Another term which is used is:
</p>
<p>Backorder   An item is on backorder or backlogged if it is not in stock, has already 
</p>
<p>been ordered from a supplier, but the order has not yet been received.
</p>
<p>20.7.1  Multiple Locations and Status Settings
</p>
<p>It is easy to grasp a situation where items are either in stock or not. However, vari-
</p>
<p>ations on the theme arise in practice. Computer systems need to allow for many 
</p>
<p>possibilities but this can make the situation less clear that you might wish. A given

</p>
<p>stock item may be held in a number of locations. Also the status of the item can 
</p>
<p>have variations, such as:
</p>
<p>Received but not cleared into stock,
</p>
<p>In transit,
</p>
<p>In stock but reserved for a project,
</p>
<p>In stock but reserved for emergency,
</p>
<p>Assigned for disposal.
</p>
<p>Transactions between these and other status categories at all the various loca-
</p>
<p>tions can lead you to use a little black book in which you keep track of the things 
</p>
<p>you really want to know about. This is not defensible in theory.
</p>
<p>20.8  Dependent Demand
</p>
<p>Dependent demand is demand which can be estimated or planned, by time and 
</p>
<p>quantity, from a production plan or a scheduled maintenance plan. Examples are:
</p>
<p>&bull; The consumption of fuel, for a known vehicle fleet operating to an established 
</p>
<p>production or delivery schedule.
</p>
<p>&bull; Consumption of chemicals or other consumables used in a number of routine or 
</p>
<p>planned applications.
</p>
<p>&bull; Spares such as spark plugs or brake pads used in an established scheduled main-
</p>
<p>tenance plan.
</p>
<p>&bull; Spares which are ordered for a known repair, or for a shutdown involving planned 
</p>
<p>replacement of components.
</p>
<p>If dependent demand is quite regular it can be managed by routinely ordering 
</p>
<p>quantities sufficient to cover the demand. Occasional variations from average will 
</p>
<p>be dealt with by varying the order and by holding a safety stock.
</p>
<p>20.8.1  Kanban System
</p>
<p>The initiation of the reorder process may best be handled by a Kanban system. 
</p>
<p>In a Kanban system the reduction in stock below the reorder level is indicated by 
</p>
<p>a physical card which is released when the critical stock level is reached. This is 
</p>
<p>theoretically the same as an electronic signal, but the physical card can be easily 
</p>
<p>recognized. The card will indicate the quantity to be reordered.
</p>
<p>20.8.2  Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) Report
</p>
<p>If demand is dependent mainly on known but irregular activities, we use a 
</p>
<p>Materials Requirements Planning (MRP) analysis and report of the type shown 
</p>
<p>in Fig. 20.5. The item referred to in that example is a type of grease, purchased 
</p>
<p>20.7 Stock Status and Control Terminology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>350 Stock Control
</p>
<p>in multiples of 50 kg, which is used in servicing major machines such as mining 
</p>
<p>shovels, draglines and ball mills.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 20.5 the rows correspond to planned events in date order. The first row 
</p>
<p>shows the opening stock which is 13 kg and this quantity appears in the Net Level 
</p>
<p>column. Existing purchase orders provide data for the Due In column. Row 2 
</p>
<p>shows that we currently have 50 kg Due In under Purchase Order PO-123 on 6 
</p>
<p>July. The Net Level column shows the projected stock after each planned transac-
</p>
<p>tion. In row 2 the Net Level is 63, as the 50 kg from the PO-123 are added to the 
</p>
<p>stock of 13. The data for the Due Out column is created from the current utiliza-
</p>
<p>tion plan. The next planned event is a Due Out of 25 kg required on 10 July by 
</p>
<p>Work Order WO-456, which will reduce the Net Level to 38 kg.
</p>
<p>The report continues projecting forward the Dues In and Dues Out, running as 
</p>
<p>far ahead as we choose to plan, usually at least two delivery lead times ahead. In 
</p>
<p>this case, the lead time is 28 days so we will plan for 2 months ahead. The Net 
</p>
<p>Level column will eventually show a shortage, represented by a negative net level. 
</p>
<p>This is an indication that we need to take action so that the shortage is prevented. 
</p>
<p>If the shortage first occurs more than one lead time ahead, we cover the shortage 
</p>
<p>by placing an order. If a shortage occurs within the normal lead time, we need to 
</p>
<p>take special action. This may be placing a rush order, delaying the lowest priority 
</p>
<p>use, or providing a partial quantity to one or more demands.
</p>
<p>Every change in the supply or demand situation requires a revision of the 
</p>
<p>Materials Requirements Planning Report. However, in practice it is usually suf-
</p>
<p>ficient to generate a new report at a convenient regular interval such as daily for 
</p>
<p>critical items or weekly for noncritical or slow moving items.
</p>
<p>20.9  Independent Demand Items
</p>
<p>Independent demand items are items for which demands occur on a variable basis, 
</p>
<p>such as spare parts required for unpredictable breakdown repairs.
</p>
<p>20.9.1  Fast Moving Items
</p>
<p>For fast moving independent demand items, a typical cycle of stock level from 
</p>
<p>order to reorder is shown graphically in Fig. 20.6.
</p>
<p>The stock level is shown vertically and time is shown horizontally. The stock level 
</p>
<p>following an earlier delivery starts at some initial value as shown on the left-hand 
</p>
<p>axis, and then falls irregularly over time. The current net stock position is monitored, 
</p>
<p>and when it falls below the reorder level, an order for a reorder quantity is placed. 
</p>
<p>There is then a lead time after which the order is delivered. The stock then increases 
</p>
<p>by the reorder quantity and a similar cycle of events is repeated. Control of the stock 
</p>
<p>is effected by setting appropriate values for the reorder revel and reorder quantity.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>351
</p>
<p>20.9.2  Reorder Level
</p>
<p>The reorder level is a stock level such that, when the net stock falls below it, an 
</p>
<p>order should be placed. The reorder level is represented by the horizontal dot-
</p>
<p>ted line in Fig. 20.6. A guideline value for the reorder level is twice the average 
</p>
<p>demand in the lead time.
</p>
<p>20.9.3  Lead Time
</p>
<p>Lead time is the time taken from when the net level falls below the reorder level 
</p>
<p>until the item becomes available for issue. The estimate of the lead time should 
</p>
<p>include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Time that it takes us to identify that stock has fallen below the reorder level
</p>
<p>&bull; Time taken to place the order
</p>
<p>&bull; Time from the supplier receiving the order to delivery
</p>
<p>&bull; Time taken from delivery until the item is available to a user, e.g., checked in 
</p>
<p>and placed on the shelf.
</p>
<p>During the lead time stock will continue to be used. The average amount of 
</p>
<p>stock used in the lead time is known as the average lead time demand, or simply 
</p>
<p>as the lead time demand. The reorder level should be set to a level which will 
</p>
<p>usually cover the lead time demand, so that no actual stockout occurs. However, 
</p>
<p>if the reorder level is high, it will mean that excessive stock is often being car-
</p>
<p>ried. A guideline value for the reorder level is twice the average demand in the 
</p>
<p>lead time.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>352 Stock Control
</p>
<p>20.9.4  Reorder Quantity
</p>
<p>The reorder quantity is the quantity to be ordered. This is typically a convenient 
</p>
<p>handling quantity of 1&ndash;3 months demand, with possible consideration of quan-
</p>
<p>tity discounts. However, even with discounts it is rarely worth ordering more than 
</p>
<p>1 year&rsquo;s supply.
</p>
<p>20.9.5  MIN and MAX
</p>
<p>The stock control process may also be presented in terms of minimum (MIN) and 
</p>
<p>maximum (MAX) values. MIN is the same as the reorder level, so that an order is 
</p>
<p>placed if the net level is below MIN. MAX is a maximum stock level. MAX can 
</p>
<p>be regarded as similar to the reorder quantity, but it also gives the stock controller 
</p>
<p>the option of ordering a varied amount if the circumstances call for it, so that we 
</p>
<p>order enough to bring the stock up to MAX.
</p>
<p>A great deal of statistical analysis has gathered in the literature about stock con-
</p>
<p>trol, but as a rough guide, the reorder level or MIN should be twice the demand in 
</p>
<p>the resupply lead time. The reason for this is that this policy will cover the possi-
</p>
<p>bility that something goes wrong in the reorder process. The fault will be identified 
</p>
<p>after one lead time, leaving a second lead time for the mix up to be rectified.
</p>
<p>The reorder quantity or MAX should be a convenient ordering and delivery 
</p>
<p>quantity, sufficient to cover demand for a readily foreseeable period ahead, such as 
</p>
<p>1&ndash;3 months.
</p>
<p>20.10  Target Level
</p>
<p>A variation on the MIN and MAX method of stock control is the Target Level method. 
</p>
<p>In a target level policy, if at the time of ordering, the net level is below a set target 
</p>
<p>level, then sufficient is ordered to bring it up to the target level. This approach is con-
</p>
<p>venient if routine deliveries occur with the quantity to be ordered being flexible from 
</p>
<p>delivery to delivery. Regular milk deliveries and weekly grocery purchasing are exam-
</p>
<p>ples. In this method, the MIN level is not used but the MAX level acts as a target. If 
</p>
<p>the net level is below MAX, then sufficient is ordered to bring it up to MAX. With all 
</p>
<p>methods, adjustments may need to be made for exceptional demands or shortages.
</p>
<p>20.11  Forecasting
</p>
<p>Scientific reorder control for independent demand items depends on estimates of 
</p>
<p>the average demand per month and the average resupply lead time. These param-
</p>
<p>eters can vary through time and a forecasting system, or more truthfully, a demand </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>353
</p>
<p>tracking system should be used to track variations in the demand. The simplest 
</p>
<p>systems are based on calculating a moving average of demands. The average will 
</p>
<p>rise or fall as demand changes and the reorder level and reorder quantities should 
</p>
<p>be linked so that they follow the changes.
</p>
<p>For spare parts, the exponentially weighted moving average, or exponential 
</p>
<p>smoothing method is recommended. It has the advantage that, in the case of slow 
</p>
<p>movers, it will vary gradually, whereas a 12 months moving average, for example, 
</p>
<p>would fall to zero after a year with no demand.
</p>
<p>Besides variations in the level of demands, there can be seasonal variations 
</p>
<p>and trends. Changes in trend are difficult to deal with automatically and may 
</p>
<p>require human intervention to correct the forecasts. Another difficulty is outliers, 
</p>
<p>that is, exceptional circumstances which may rarely if ever repeat. A classic in 
</p>
<p>the Australian bush is the demand for fencing wire, for which a bush fire running 
</p>
<p>through a region can cause a once-in-a-lifetime outlier in demand.
</p>
<p>Lead time variations are more likely to be caused by administrative changes; 
</p>
<p>for example, changes in supplier, in the delivery system, or the communication 
</p>
<p>system. Shorter lead times are beneficial in providing a more responsive system. 
</p>
<p>Long lead times due to shipment by sea need a more strict attention for lead time 
</p>
<p>estimation.
</p>
<p>20.12  Reorder Risks
</p>
<p>Risks to the smooth running of the reorder process include:
</p>
<p>a.  Failure to identify when the net stock level has fallen below the reorder level or 
</p>
<p>MIN
</p>
<p>b. Lumpy demand causes a shortage
</p>
<p>c. Failure to place the required order
</p>
<p>d. Wrong item ordered
</p>
<p>e. Order not received by supplier
</p>
<p>f. Order not acted on by supplier
</p>
<p>g. Wrong item sent
</p>
<p>h. Loss in transit
</p>
<p>i. Item wrongly identified
</p>
<p>j. Item faulty at receival quality check
</p>
<p>k. Item misplaced or lost on site
</p>
<p>l. Item faulty when brought into use.
</p>
<p>These risks are often more significant in practice than any fine tuning which may 
</p>
<p>be achieved by statistical approaches to reorder level setting.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>354 Stock Control
</p>
<p>20.13  Inventory Faults
</p>
<p>Some common faults in the management of inventory are as follows.
</p>
<p>&bull; Items not assigned a formal location but kept in casual or inconsistent locations;
</p>
<p>&bull; Item location not recorded;
</p>
<p>&bull; Item kept in multiple locations for no valid reason;
</p>
<p>&bull; Item not in computer inventory system;
</p>
<p>&bull; Item not in purchasing system;
</p>
<p>&bull; Description of items is missing or incomplete;
</p>
<p>&bull; Varied descriptions or codings for identical item;
</p>
<p>&bull; Part number, manufacturer, or manufacturer part number not specified;
</p>
<p>&bull; Hazardous conditions not specified;
</p>
<p>&bull; Stock control parameters not specified (Max and Min or reorder level and reor-
</p>
<p>der quantity);
</p>
<p>&bull; Lead time for resupply not specified;
</p>
<p>&bull; Shelf life not specified;
</p>
<p>&bull; Default supplier not specified;
</p>
<p>&bull; Last or current purchase details not readily accessible;
</p>
<p>&bull; Freight company not specified;
</p>
<p>&bull; Stocktake not performed, incomplete, or not recorded; and 
</p>
<p>&bull; Items held informally by various people.
</p>
<p>20.14  Safety Stock
</p>
<p>The expected level of stock remaining at the end of the lead time is known as 
</p>
<p>safety stock. If the reorder level is twice the average lead time demand, as recom-
</p>
<p>mended, the safety stock is equal to the average lead time demand. When the lead 
</p>
<p>time elapses, we expect the item to be delivered. If it is not, then we should check 
</p>
<p>why. If the order is not on track, then the safety stock will provide cover for an 
</p>
<p>additional lead time in which to get supply.
</p>
<p>20.15  Item Criticality
</p>
<p>Critical items are items that are particularly essential to the operation of the organ-
</p>
<p>ization. Reviewing item criticality requires a knowledge of which machines and 
</p>
<p>processes are most critical to the business. Critical items will normally be:
</p>
<p>&bull; Consumables that are essential for mainstream operations,
</p>
<p>&bull; Spares that are essential to maintain mainstream plant.
</p>
<p>Criticality can be dealt with by increasing the reorder level (or MIN) where criti-
</p>
<p>cality is identified. As a guideline, increase the reorder level by 25 % and round </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>355
</p>
<p>up to the next integer value. So a noncritical reorder level of 5 will become a criti-
</p>
<p>cal item reorder level of 7. For critical dependent demand items, use the Materials 
</p>
<p>Requirements Planning method shown in Fig. 20.5.
</p>
<p>20.16  Summary of Reorder Rules Fast Moving
</p>
<p>Reorder Level or MIN = 2 * average lead time demand, rounded up.
</p>
<p>Reorder Quantity or MAX = 1&ndash;3 months demand, rounded to a convenient 
</p>
<p> purchase quantity.
</p>
<p>For critical items increase quantities by 25 %. Do not order more than will last for 
</p>
<p>the shelf life.
</p>
<p>20.16.1  Stock Control Example
</p>
<p>An item has an average demand of 4 per month and a lead time of 2 weeks. What 
</p>
<p>MAX and MIN values should be set?
</p>
<p>Solution: Take the 2-week lead time as corresponding to half a month. The average 
</p>
<p>demand in the lead time is 2.
</p>
<p>We set MIN = 2 * average demand in lead time = 2 * 2 = 4
</p>
<p>We choose to set MAX to be 3 months demand, MAX = 12.
</p>
<p>Thus the control parameters are:
</p>
<p>MIN = 4
</p>
<p>MAX = 12.
</p>
<p>20.17  Current Action
</p>
<p>Stock levels must be reviewed, ideally at every issue, or on a frequent regular 
</p>
<p>basis, e.g., daily.
</p>
<p>At any time we may have:
</p>
<p>&bull; Stock on hand
</p>
<p>&bull; Dues In
</p>
<p>&bull; Dues Out
</p>
<p>&bull; Special Demands.
</p>
<p>We should place an order if:
</p>
<p>The actual reorder quantity should be enough to take the net level, allowing for 
</p>
<p>dues in and out and for any special demands, up to the MAX level.
</p>
<p>(20.1)(Stock + Dues In) &minus; (Dues Out + Special Demand) &lt; MIN
</p>
<p>20.15 Item Criticality</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>356 Stock Control
</p>
<p>Thus we have:
</p>
<p>Net Level = Stock + Dues In &minus; (Dues Out + Special Demand)
</p>
<p>If Net Level &lt; Reorder level then:
</p>
<p>Actual Reorder Quantity = Max &minus; Net Level
</p>
<p>Round to allow for a Supply Multiple.
</p>
<p>20.18  Complications
</p>
<p>Several additional factors make stock control complicated and make fully auto-
</p>
<p>mated control difficult. These include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Supply multiple Supply may be in quantity multiples which are convenient for 
</p>
<p>packaging or transportation. A choice between available supply quantities will 
</p>
<p>have to be made. For example, oil in 20 L cans or 200 L drums.
</p>
<p>&bull; Price breaks Price breaks occur depending on order quantities. The cost of oil 
</p>
<p>per liter will be lower in 200 L drums than in 20 L cans. A decision to increase 
</p>
<p>the reorder quantity to take advantage of a price break may be needed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Issue multiple Items are issued in multiple quantities, for example spark plugs. 
</p>
<p>The multiple may be different for different applications, e.g., four- or six-cylinder 
</p>
<p>engine.
</p>
<p>&bull; Issue quantity is variable The issue quantity varies from job to job, for example 
</p>
<p>when an item is stripped down in some cases new seals may be used but in other 
</p>
<p>cases, the existing seals may be left in place or reused or partly so.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reserved stock Items required for a critical machines, specific repairs, specific 
</p>
<p>projects, or for a shutdown, may need to be held in reserve; otherwise, when 
</p>
<p>the breakdown or shutdown occurs, the items will no longer be available and a 
</p>
<p>major delay in can occur.
</p>
<p>&bull; Kits Some items form part of kits of components which are issued in a set to 
</p>
<p>carry out certain repairs. When a kit is issued, a new kit should be prepared, and 
</p>
<p>this will draw stock from the item store. Kits may sometimes be returned partly 
</p>
<p>used, in which case the kit should be replenished. Kits may be raided for com-
</p>
<p>ponents in an emergency (oh no!).
</p>
<p>&bull; Shelf life The time for which an item can be stored before it deteriorates. This 
</p>
<p>may be an issue. Do not order so much that the shelf life is exceeded. To avoid 
</p>
<p>items lingering in the store, arrange for first-in-first-out, or FIFO, use of items.
</p>
<p>20.18.1  Consignment
</p>
<p>Stock on consignment is stock that suppliers provide into store, which is only 
</p>
<p>invoiced as it is used. This can have advantages for the user who is not commit-
</p>
<p>ted to unused stock. It can also suit a supplier who gets a guaranteed customer and 
</p>
<p>perhaps also gets free storage.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>20.18.2  Cannibalization
</p>
<p>This term refers to a situation where we have two items of equipment which require 
</p>
<p>different spares, and the spares are unavailable. We can take spare parts from one 
</p>
<p>item in order to get the other one working. This is not an ideal situation but it may 
</p>
<p>be the only practical resolution to return a needed item to production in a hurry.
</p>
<p>20.18.3  Returned Stores
</p>
<p>Returned stores are generally a curse but may sometimes be a blessing. The con-
</p>
<p>dition of returned stores may be hard to assess, and using them may give rise to 
</p>
<p>safety problems. In the case of technical items, expertise is needed to identify 
</p>
<p>and assess them and it is often not practical or economic to provide this. On the 
</p>
<p>other hand, a scrap yard of returned stores or scrapped items may provide the only 
</p>
<p>source of spares for old equipment. Where else will you find an authentic gearstick 
</p>
<p>knob for your 1935 Chevvy?
</p>
<p>20.18.4  Storekeeper Personnel
</p>
<p>Employ ex-tradesmen in the stores. They understand the equipment, are sympa-
</p>
<p>thetic to the needs of operations and maintenance, and have the interests of the 
</p>
<p>industry at heart. Young blokes off the street will know nothing&mdash;initially.
</p>
<p>20.18.5  Overstocking
</p>
<p>Stores people tend to be criticized more for shortages than for overstocking, so the 
</p>
<p>tendency is to overstock.
</p>
<p>20.19  Repair Pools and Rotables
</p>
<p>A repair pool is a number of additional machines, assemblies, or components which 
</p>
<p>are provided on a standby basis. When a failure occurs, an item from the repair pool 
</p>
<p>is quickly brought into service. The failed item is then repaired and returned to the 
</p>
<p>repair pool. Repair pools can significantly increase system availability at moderate 
</p>
<p>cost. The items are referred to as rotables. Figure 20.7 illustrates the process.
</p>
<p>It is important to initiate the repair cycle promptly. Sometimes the rotable is left 
</p>
<p>languishing in a corner, with no replenishment action taken until a crisis occurs.
</p>
<p>20.18 Complications</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>358 Stock Control
</p>
<p>In some cases, only the owner&rsquo;s own assemblies (identified by serial number) 
</p>
<p>are returned to the owner&rsquo;s pool. A repair facility which deals with many customers 
</p>
<p>(e.g., as an agent for a major OEM) may supply rotables which are not necessarily 
</p>
<p>those which the owner has sent for repair, so that the failed item is really a financial 
</p>
<p>trade-in. In this case, the mean time to replenish the repair pool may be less than 
</p>
<p>the time to turn around a specific rotable. A judgement needs to be made regarding 
</p>
<p>the appropriate lead time to use in estimating the size of the repair pool. As a guide-
</p>
<p>line, the size of the repair pool should be twice the number of failures expected in 
</p>
<p>the turnaround lead time. For critical items, one or two extras may be carried.
</p>
<p>20.19.1  Repair Parts
</p>
<p>Repair parts are items which are sent for repair to a higher echelon, but no repair 
</p>
<p>pool is kept. The item is out of service while the repair is being carried out. 
</p>
<p>In-between situations can arise if the repair part is replaced from stock or by can-
</p>
<p>nibalization, but normally the user awaits the return of the repair part.
</p>
<p>20.20  Slow Moving Items
</p>
<p>A slow moving item is an item where the mean time between demands is much 
</p>
<p>longer than the lead time. As a guideline, if the mean time between demands is 
</p>
<p>more than ten times, the average lead time then the item is slow moving. Thus 
</p>
<p>an item with an average demand of 1 per year and a lead time of 1 month is slow

</p>
<p>moving. The mean lead time demand is the average demand in the average lead 
</p>
<p>time. An item is slow moving if:
</p>
<p>For slow moving items, the probability of multiple demands in the lead time is very 
</p>
<p>small. On the basis of the guideline just given, it is less than 0.01, assuming that 
</p>
<p>demands are independent. Classify slow moving items into the following categories:
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Stock Zero&rdquo; items. Do not hold stock. In this case, you have to wait for deliv-
</p>
<p>ery every time. This is also described as Order Only On Demand (OOOD).
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Stock One&rdquo; items. This is the default. Usually have 1 in stock. Order when 
</p>
<p>stock reaches zero (MIN = 1).
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Stock Two&rdquo; items. Items for which extra safety stock will be held. Usually have 
</p>
<p>two in stock. Order when stock reaches 1 (MIN = 2).
</p>
<p>The choice of category for any given item is based on the following factors:
</p>
<p>Demand Rate Low values reduce the holding. A mean lead time demand of less than 
</p>
<p>0.01 will usually result in a &ldquo;Stock Zero&rdquo; decision, that is, orders are only placed 
</p>
<p>when a demand for an item eventuates. But consideration should be given to holding 
</p>
<p>the item as an insurance spare, in which case we will have a &ldquo;Stock One&rdquo; policy.
</p>
<p>Item Cost A high cost reduces the holding; for example, a high cost may result in a 
</p>
<p>stock-two item being reduced to the stock one category.
</p>
<p>Shortage Cost/Criticality Higher values of shortage cost or high criticality will 
</p>
<p>increase the holding. This may push an item from the &ldquo;stock zero&rdquo; to the &ldquo;stock 
</p>
<p>one&rdquo; category, for example.
</p>
<p>Lead Time A long lead time increases the holding.
</p>
<p>Safety and Environment Potential problems under these headings increase the 
</p>
<p>holding.
</p>
<p>The decision as to whether to hold stock of a slow mover, and if so, whether to 
</p>
<p>hold one or two items can be assisted by considering the guidelines summarized 
</p>
<p>in Fig. 20.8. Consider each factor in turn and tick one of the columns in regard to 
</p>
<p>that factor. If none of the factors is compelling in terms of holding stock, then we 
</p>
<p>would take the &ldquo;No stock&rdquo; option. Otherwise, the placing of the ticks might indi-
</p>
<p>cate that we should hold a stock of one or two. If it is really important to avoid a 
</p>
<p>shortage and none of the other factors override this, then we may stock two.

</p>
<p>20.20.1  Example
</p>
<p>A consultant uses a printer which requires ink cartridges. The demand rate and lead 
</p>
<p>time are low and the item cost and safety are not significant. However, the short-
</p>
<p>age cost or criticality, in terms of a cartridge running out at an inconvenient time is 
</p>
<p>assessed as significant, so the decision is to Stock 1 cartridge (of each color).
</p>
<p>20.21  Insurance Spares
</p>
<p>An &ldquo;insurance spare&rdquo; is one where the probability that it will be needed is low, but 
</p>
<p>the consequence of not having it is high, so on balance we decide to hold it. The item 
</p>
<p>need not be high cost. In fact, low cost is an argument in favor of holding a spare.
</p>
<p>For high cost and high shortage-cost items, have a contingency plan. This may 
</p>
<p>involve:
</p>
<p>&bull; holding a spare equipment, this is an insurance spare.
</p>
<p>&bull; sharing this with others.
</p>
<p>&bull; arranging air freight as a contingency plan for an emergency.
</p>
<p>&bull; making a contingency agreement with the supplier.
</p>
<p>&bull; having a contingency plan which provides an adequate short-term solution, if 
</p>
<p>feasible.
</p>
<p>&bull; setting up inventory and supplier file entries so that the purchasing process can 
</p>
<p>proceed promptly when the part is needed.
</p>
<p>20.22  Summary of Policy Types
</p>
<p>For a given item, we need to decide what type of reorder policy should be used 
</p>
<p>such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Independent demand Reorder Level and Reorder Quantity (= Min and Max);
</p>
<p>&bull; Dependent demand Material Requirements Planning (MRP);
</p>
<p>&bull; Routine restocking Just In Time (JIT)/Kanbans; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Slow moving Zero, One, and Two stock holding policies.
</p>
<p>20.23  Performance Indicators
</p>
<p>20.23.1  Service Level
</p>
<p>The service level is the proportion of items supplied at the time required. The ser-
</p>
<p>vice level is a performance indicator. However, the service level only measures </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>361
</p>
<p>performance from the consumer&rsquo;s point of view and if it is the only performance 
</p>
<p>indicator used, it will encourage overstocking.
</p>
<p>20.23.2  Days Supply
</p>
<p>Consideration of the number of days supply of items can help to highlight stocks 
</p>
<p>which are excessive and ones which are in short supply:
</p>
<p>Figure 20.9 shows an example of a days&ndash;supply report.
</p>
<p>Note that Net Stock = Current stock level + Dues In &minus; Dues Out.
</p>
<p>Days Supply &gt; 730 is more than 2 years supply, which normally indicates dead 
</p>
<p>stock or possibly an insurance spare;
</p>
<p>Days Supply &gt; 365 is excessive stock or slow moving;
</p>
<p>Days Supply &lt; 365 and &gt; 0 is normal;
</p>
<p>Days Supply &le; 0 is out of stock.
</p>
<p>20.23.3  Dead Stock
</p>
<p>Dead stock is items for which no future demand is expected. It is likely to be for 
</p>
<p>items which are no longer used. Correct gross anomalies by transferring, writ-
</p>
<p>ing off, and disposing of stock which is of no further use at a given location. But 
</p>
<p>be careful not to overreact. Some items may be insurance spares or may only be 
</p>
<p>required at long intervals.
</p>

</p>
<p>20.23.4  Stock Turns Per Year
</p>
<p>Another indicator of the performance of the inventory system for any given stock 
</p>
<p>item is stock turns per year. This is the number of items issued in the year divided 
</p>
<p>by the number held in stock&mdash;typically at stock take time.
</p>
<p>For example, if the annual demand is 40 and the stock level is 10 then the Stock 
</p>
<p>Turns per year is 40/10 = 4. This analysis can be useful in identifying items with 
</p>
<p>high or low inventory movement.
</p>
<p>20.23.5  Value Turns
</p>
<p>Another performance measure is value turns. This is the annual demand value 
</p>
<p>divided by the stock value at stocktake, taken over a range of stocks. For an indi-
</p>
<p>vidual item this is the same as stock turns. A low level indicates a low turnover 
</p>
<p>rate of stock, which is inefficient.
</p>
<p>Taking the Sum over a given range of inventory items:
</p>
<p>Stock Cost = Sum (Stock Level * Item Cost)
</p>
<p>Annual Demand Value = Sum (Annual Demand * Item Cost)
</p>
<p>Value Turns Per Year = Annual Demand Value/Stock Cost
</p>
<p>The value turns can be calculated for the entire stock or for sections of it. A useful 
</p>
<p>assessment can be made by calculating the value turns for items in various ranges 
</p>
<p>of days supply. Insurance spares, however, are a special case and should be kept 
</p>
<p>out of the value turns calculation.
</p>
<p>The cost-benefit of the current inventory can by examined by analyzing the cost of 
</p>
<p>the stock and the value of the demand for that stock. Items with high stock cost but 
</p>
<p>low demand value per year are poorly performing. These items should be eliminated 
</p>
<p>unless they are being retained deliberately as insurance stock against assessed risks.
</p>
<p>The example in Fig. 20.10 is based on a vehicle importer who had substantial 
</p>
<p>amounts of dead stock, due to model changes. The dead stock items are those with 
</p>
<p>365+ days supply. These items also have very low value turns. Similar results 
</p>
<p>occurred in an oil refinery with spares for obsolete plant.
</p>
<p>20.23.6  ABC Analysis
</p>
<p>Sort the items by Annual Demand Value (or &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Stock Turns Per Year = Annual Demand/Stock Level.
</p>
<p>Annual Demand Value = Sum(Annual Demand &times; Item Value)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>363
</p>
<p>Group into &ldquo;A, B, C&rdquo; classes by Demand Value.
</p>
<p>&bull; Class A is items with high demand value (top 20 %)
</p>
<p>&bull; Class B items with medium demand value (next 40 %)
</p>
<p>&bull; Class C items with low demand value (bottom 40 %)
</p>
<p>&bull; Possibly also Class D for zero value = dead stock, but could include some 
</p>
<p>insurance spares. Exclude these from percentages.
</p>
<p>Focus most attention on improving the management of the Class A items.
</p>
<p>20.23.7  Inventory Improvement Actions
</p>
<p>&bull; Eliminate stocks for items no longer in use.
</p>
<p>&bull; Retain stock of items which may be needed, even if they are old, slow moving 
</p>
<p>or insurance items.
</p>
<p>&bull; Eliminate excessive stocks. Stocks above the (reorder level + reorder quan-
</p>
<p>tity) or MAX are normally excessive. Old stock can often deteriorate and cause 
</p>
<p>problems when used.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce lead times, e.g., by faster freight service, or more frequent review.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use surface transport normally but air freight in an emergency.
</p>
<p>&bull; Consolidate stock holdings and/or stock level information across sites.
</p>
<p>&bull; Get the supplier to hold stock or send stock on consignment.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use a Just In Time call off system for steadily moving items.
</p>
<p>20.24  Accounting for Inventory
</p>
<p>Inventory is an asset. Fast moving inventory, with a turnover period of less 
</p>
<p>than 1 year is a current asset, whereas slow moving inventory is a fixed asset. 
</p>
<p>Categories of inventory include:
</p>
<p>Days Supply 
</p>

<p>Stock Cost Annual Demand Value Turns /

</p>
<p>&bull; Spare parts, slow moving

</p>
<p>20.24.1  Inventory in the Balance Sheet
</p>
<p>Inventory of all types occurs as an asset in the balance sheet. Inventory must be 
</p>
<p>funded, that is, we have paid for it, and as it does not generate a return merely 
</p>
<p>by sitting there, it is something which we should try to minimize, provided that 
</p>
<p>we can do so without causing losses to appear elsewhere. This is why manufac-
</p>
<p>turers try to minimize inventory through systems such as Just In Time and Lean.
</p>
<p>20.24.2  Inventory in the Profit and Loss Account
</p>
<p>The cost of the current asset inventory purchased in the year is part of the costs in the 
</p>
<p>profit and loss statement, while the difference in the inventory value between the start 
</p>
<p>and end of the year also appears in the profit and loss statement of company accounts.
</p>
<p>In an operation which runs at a reasonably uniform pace, the difference between the 
</p>
<p>values of closing and starting inventory will normally be small, so that the signifi-
</p>
<p>cance of changes in inventory value will not be great. However, an apparent profit 
</p>
<p>arising primarily from an increase in the value of inventory over the year should be 
</p>
<p>regarded with suspicion, as the inventory may ultimately not realize its quoted value. 
</p>
<p>People have been known to lose their jobs when they were found out fudging the 
</p>
<p>profit by overstating the value of inventory. Work-in-process inventory and capital 
</p>
<p>developments partially completed, are areas where valuations can be hard to estimate.
</p>
<p>20.24.3  Overstocking and Write Downs
</p>
<p>For finished goods, an overstocked situation may lead to discounting of the price 
</p>
<p>and hence to an inventory write down which will affect profits. A potential prob-
</p>
<p>lem, relates to maintenance parts. Fast moving spares are treated as current assets, 
</p>
<p>EBITDA = Revenue &minus; Costs + Closing inventory $ &minus; Starting inventory $</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>365
</p>
<p>but if they do not move as quickly as expected&mdash;as often happens&mdash;they can accu-
</p>
<p>mulate in value on the books. If it then turns out that they are subsequently worth 
</p>
<p>much less than their purchase price, due perhaps to being obsolete, then a substan-
</p>
<p>tial write down, and hence loss of profit will occur.
</p>
<p>As an example, consider a company which has a fleet of vehicles which uses a 
</p>
<p>particular type of tire. The company buys a supply of tires for the vehicles. Tires 
</p>
<p>are an expense item, that is, a current asset, and the value of tires in stock at the 
</p>
<p>end of the year will contribute to profit. Later the vehicles are replaced by a dif-
</p>
<p>ferent model which uses different tires. Tires of the original type which remain 
</p>
<p>in stock will remain as a current asset, but may in fact have no value, in which 
</p>
<p>case a write down will be required. On a small scale, this may be unimportant, but 
</p>
<p>experience suggests that, when accumulated over many assets and a long period 
</p>
<p>of time, the problem can become substantial. Management will be concerned at 
</p>
<p>the cost and timing of a write down as it will reduce profit in the year in which it 
</p>
<p>occurs.
</p>
<p>A possible solution to the previous problem is to hold spares as capital items 
</p>
<p>and depreciate them. However, another problem may then arise. Often, spares are 
</p>
<p>charged out to a user, possibly an outside customer or an internal cost center, as 
</p>
<p>they are taken from store. If spares are depreciated, they will be charged out at 
</p>
<p>much less than their purchase price, and the decrease in value will be borne by 
</p>
<p>our company or our cost center. To avoid this, we would need to have a policy 
</p>
<p>of charging out spares at cost. Another thing is that if spares are depreciated, the 
</p>
<p>accountants may want to write them off as of little or no value, when in fact they 
</p>
<p>are essential to keep our major assets working.
</p>
<p>Thus there are some tricky issues relating to accounting for slow moving spare 
</p>
<p>parts.
</p>
<p>20.25  So How Did We Win?
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of your war stories seem pretty negative, Pop,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pop. &ldquo;In fact Hermann, our German storeman in Sennelager after 
</p>
<p>the war, used to tell me that he couldn&rsquo;t understand how his side lost!
</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day though, a Polish bloke turned up at the store looking hot and both-
</p>
<p>ered. He&rsquo;d walked about 10 km from where his tank transporter had broken down. 
</p>
<p>A brake jumper lead had failed and it wasn&rsquo;t safe to drive with the trailer brakes 
</p>
<p>not working. He had the lead in his hand&mdash;he asked if we had a spare.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have tank transporter spares and neither did anyone in the area. I 
</p>
<p>took a look at the lead and figured that we could fix it temporarily by replacing the 
</p>
<p>worn section with a piece of metal tube. I told the Polish driver to go over to the 
</p>
<p>canteen and get something to eat and come back in an hour.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got Chalky White to turn a length of tube to the right size and to fix it into 
</p>
<p>the lead with hose clips. We tested it on the compressed air machine and it was 
</p>
<p>okay. The Polish driver was delighted, and we had a call later that day saying that 
</p>
<p>he had got to his base safely and thanks.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at a social barbecue later that Hermann said to me that that just 
</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have happened in his army. They worked strictly in silos, and there was 
</p>
<p>no way that his regiment would have let a foreigner near their stores, much less 
</p>
<p>gone to the trouble of helping him out.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>20.26  But Problems Remain
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I learnt in my Operations Management class ever seems to work,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Veronica complained one day at the water cooler.
</p>
<p>I was going to ask what in particular she had in mind, but she went on seamlessly.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chlorinator has umpteen types of seal and a different one fails every time. 
</p>
<p>They only cost a few dollars each but any one of them can bring the whole system 
</p>
<p>to a grinding halt. Not only that, but you can&rsquo;t get them in this country, they have 
</p>
<p>to be imported, and once we have a particular type in store we never need it again!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>I groaned sympathetically. She was feeling pretty stressed&mdash;the chlorinator was 
</p>
<p>off-line again.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ordered a whole lot of seals for the annual shutdown, but guess what&mdash;some per-
</p>
<p>son (I think she said person) took a couple out of the store to use on the other line. 
</p>
<p>Now were waiting for air-freight on $2 worth of items, at $20,000 an hour down-time.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; I said, and edged away from the cooler.
</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
</p>
<p>A week or so later when things had calmed down, I asked Veronica what she 
</p>
<p>meant about the Operations Management class.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well the lectures were all to do with the standard deviation of the lead time 
</p>
<p>demand which seemed to be the answer to everything, but there is no chance of 
</p>
<p>getting off first base with that in real life.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first problem is that the technicians want access to the stores 24 h per day 
</p>
<p>7 days per week. That cuts right across a stack of security issues. So the techni-
</p>
<p>cians &ldquo;expense&rdquo; a whole lot of stores that they think they might need and squirrel 
</p>
<p>them away somewhere. This completely invalidates any demand data on the com-
</p>
<p>puter system.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another problem is that the people who work in the store nowadays, and the 
</p>
<p>computer system people, know nothing about the equipment or about mainte-
</p>
<p>nance&mdash;it is all just part-numbers to them. Of course it&rsquo;s not their fault, but if only 
</p>
<p>they knew or cared about what was going on in the plant it would make a lot of 
</p>
<p>difference.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing that we did at Widdecombe,&rdquo; I offered, &ldquo;Was to employ ex-trades 
</p>
<p>people in the store. They were all ex-mates of the technicians and understood the 
</p>
<p>plant because they had worked there for years.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, there is a guy called Tom Cobbley who could do with a job right now, 
</p>
<p>and who knows the refinery really well.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; said Veronica, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what Human Resources says about that idea.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know where the academics go wrong,&rdquo; I said, the next time I met 
</p>
<p>Veronica in the tea room.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>I reminded her about her comments about Operations Management lectures.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What they do,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is replace a simple problem with a harder one. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, if you said to the storeman that it was okay to run out of stock of non-critical 
</p>
<p>items occasionally, he could probably make a fair shot at the correct reorder level. But 
</p>
<p>if you tell him to set the reorder level to the mean lead time demand plus 1.68 stand-
</p>
<p>ard deviations then you have created a problem that he&rsquo;s not going to try to solve.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; said Veronica, &ldquo;but to be fair, the analytical types are 
</p>
<p>trying to cope with thousands of items on some automatic basis. A human being 
</p>
<p>can probably get a better answer if he has time to work on a particular item.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that that consultant that we had was a complete idiot, but I can see 
</p>
<p>what went wrong now,&rdquo; said Veronica a few weeks later.
</p>
<p>She knew that I always lent a sympathetic ear to her stories.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spent ages setting the reorder levels on the automotive parts inventory, and 
</p>
<p>as soon as he left we began to run out of parts.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was he an idiot or what?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it happened, just after he left we decided to close the warehouses in New 
</p>
<p>South Wales and Queensland and supply the dealers direct from the main store in 
</p>
<p>Victoria. That completely changed all the demand data and made the reorder levels 
</p>
<p>too low. That&rsquo;s why we ran out of parts.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The consultant wanted to implement a forecasting system which would have 
</p>
<p>updated the demand data, but apparently we were out of budget for consultants 
</p>
<p>and that never happened.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s happening now?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a mess,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear that you are leaving, Veronica&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re relocating to Perth. And by the way, I&rsquo;ve just figured something out 
</p>
<p>on the military maintenance contract.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always figure things out just too late &hellip; oops, sorry. Nothing secret, I 
</p>
<p>hope&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really. Peculiar though. We often had difficulty getting spare parts for the 
</p>
<p>older army equipment until I met up with a secondhand dealer in Melbourne who 
</p>
<p>always seemed to able to come up with the stuff. The thing I couldn&rsquo;t get was that 
</p>
<p>it would always take him until &lsquo;next Thursday&rsquo; to supply parts&mdash;it seemed odd.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I realized that there was an Army Surplus sale at the depot every 
</p>
<p>Tuesday. He was buying old stores from the Army, extracting what we needed and 
</p>
<p>selling them back to us to sell back to the Army.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was he a crook or was he providing a valuable service?&rdquo; I asked. But 
</p>
<p>Veronica had hurried off into the sunset.
</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;

<p>I saw Veronica about 6 months later at the Asset Management Conference.

<p>368 Stock Control
</p>
<p>&ldquo;All running smoothly in Perth?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like this one&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I went to the electrical distribution branch&rsquo;s store 
</p>
<p>to review their stock control procedures. As I arrived a truck pulled up with a couple 
</p>
<p>of technicians in it. The storeman asked what they wanted and then directed them 
</p>
<p>out the back to an open concrete area.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Probably over on the far left,&rdquo; he shouted.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had come to look for replacement connectors for one of the older lines. I 
</p>
<p>asked the storeman if they were easy to get.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They stopped making them 10 years ago, but some of 
</p>
<p>the ones on the old wires are still usable. We never throw anything out.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have records of what you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw-ugh,&rdquo; he said
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thinking he was expressing a certain contempt for office wallahs.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well they had one thing right,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;The storeman knew the business.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>20.27.6  Self‐Assessment Exercise 20.1 Solution
</p>
<p>1. What are the aims of inventory management?
</p>
<p> The primary aim of inventory management in the field of spares and consumables 
</p>
<p>is to enable the meeting of requirements for equipment availability at minimum 
</p>
<p>overall cost. This will involve:
</p>
<p>&bull; Keeping service to the users at a reasonably high level
</p>
<p>&bull; Keeping inventory investment reasonably low
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost-effective purchasing.
</p>
<p>A balance must be struck between these conflicting factors.
</p>
<p>More basic aims of inventory management are to ensure that:
</p>
<p>&bull; Stock identity, quantity and location are known;
</p>
<p>&bull; Stock is secure;
</p>
<p>&bull; Items are available and accessible when required;
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchase orders are placed promptly;
</p>
<p>&bull; Goods are received efficiently and effectively.
</p>
<p>2. How are spare parts normally identified?
</p>
<p> Parts will be identified by means of a part number within the organization&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>inventory management system. The computer record will normally also contain 
</p>
<p>the identification of the manufacturer and the manufacturer&rsquo;s part number.
</p>
<p>3. What is meant by
</p>
<p>a. Dependent Demand
</p>
<p> Dependent demand is demand which can be estimated or planned, by time 
</p>
<p>and quantity, from a production plan or a scheduled maintenance plan.
</p>
<p>b. Independent Demand
</p>
<p> Independent demand items are items for which demands occur on a variable 
</p>
<p>basis, such as spare parts required for breakdown repairs.
</p>
<p>4. What is meant by
</p>
<p>a. Current Stock Level The number of items physically in stock.
</p>
<p>b. Dues In Items ordered from a supplier but not yet delivered.
</p>
<p>c. Dues Out Items demanded by a user, but not yet issued.
</p>
<p>d. Net Level = Current Stock Level + Dues In &minus; Dues Out.
</p>
<p>e. Back Order An item is on backorder or backlogged if it is not in stock, 
</p>
<p>has already been ordered from a supplier, but the order has not yet been 
</p>
<p>received.

<p>20.27.7  Self‐Assessment Exercise 20.2 Solution
</p>
<p>1. What is meant by
</p>
<p>a. Reorder Level and MIN
</p>
<p> The reorder level or MIN is a value such that an order is placed when the 
</p>
<p>net stock level falls below it.
</p>
<p>b. Reorder Quantity
</p>
<p> The reorder quantity is the guideline quantity to be ordered. This is typically 
</p>
<p>a convenient handling quantity of 1&ndash;3 months demand, with possible con-
</p>
<p>sideration of quantity discounts.
</p>
<p>c. Max
</p>
<p> MAX is a guideline for the maximum amount of stock to be held. In 
</p>
<p>practice it can be used as a reorder quantity guideline or as a target level. 
</p>
<p>Typically set to a convenient handling quantity of 1&ndash;3 months demand with 
</p>
<p>possible consideration of quantity discounts.
</p>
<p>d. Lead Time
</p>
<p> Lead time is the time taken from when the net level falls below the reorder 
</p>
<p>level until the item becomes available for issue.
</p>
<p>e. Safety Stock
</p>
<p> The expected level of stock remaining at the end of the lead time is known 
</p>
<p>as safety stock.
</p>
<p>f. Service Level
</p>
<p> The service level is the proportion of items supplied at the time required.
</p>
<p>2. What factors influence stock holding policy for a slow moving item?
</p>
<p>a. Demand Rate.
</p>
<p>b. Item Cost.
</p>
<p>c. Shortage cost/Criticality.
</p>
<p>d. Lead Time.
</p>
<p>e. Safety and Environment.
</p>
<p>3. Explain the terms
</p>
<p>a. Issue Multiple
</p>
<p> Items are issued in multiple quantities, for example spark plugs. The mul-
</p>
<p>tiple may be different for different applications, e.g., four- or six-cylinder 
</p>
<p>engine.
</p>
<p>b. Shelf Life
</p>
<p>The time for which an item can be stored before it deteriorates.
</p>
<p>c. Supply Multiple
</p>
<p> Supply is in quantity multiples which are convenient for packaging or 
</p>
<p>transportation.
</p>
<p>4. What is a target level reorder policy?
</p>
<p> In a target level policy, if at the time of ordering, the net level is below a set tar-
</p>
<p>get level then sufficient is ordered to bring it up to the target level.</p>

<p>Abstract To introduce key elements of reliability, availability, and maintainability  
</p>
<p>(RAM) from an asset management perspective. Outcomes After reading this  
</p>
<p>chapter you will be aware of the need to specify and check for RAM requirements 
</p>
<p>for asset acquisitions and developments. You will learn about how RAM are meas-
</p>
<p>ured, and about the factors that lead to successful management of assets in regard 
</p>
<p>to RAM considerations. You will be aware of a number of specific  techniques 
</p>
<p>which assist with these tasks.
</p>
<p>21.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>The topics of Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) are important 
</p>
<p>areas of competence for asset managers.1 As these fields have significant technical 
</p>
<p>depth, a range of levels of expertise can be expected within an asset management 
</p>
<p>group. In a technically specialized organization, there may be a dedicated section 
</p>
<p>specializing in Reliability Engineering and related topics.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, the main concepts and techniques will be introduced but they 
</p>
<p>will not be treated in a numerical way. This material is particularly applicable for 
</p>
<p>more technically sophisticated assets.
</p>
<p>21.2  Reliability
</p>
<p>Reliability is the ability of an item to perform a required function under stated condi-
</p>
<p>tions for a specified period of time.2 Reliability is important because failures reduce 
</p>
<p>the effectiveness of service and undermine the organizational objectives which the 
</p>
<p>1 ISO 55002 Clause 6.2.1.3 Asset management objectives. &ldquo;&hellip; issues &hellip; addressed include &hellip; 
asset system availability &hellip; reliability &hellip; condition &hellip; life expectancy &hellip;&rdquo;.

<p>374 21 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability
</p>
<p>assets are intended to support. Failures may also have safety and  environmental 
</p>
<p>implications. The cost of failure is generally disproportionately high when consid-
</p>
<p>ered against the costs of sound maintenance, repair, and replacement policies.
</p>
<p>21.3  Specification and Testing3
</p>
<p>The specification of an asset should include consideration of RAM. At the acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion planning stage we carry out tests of prospective equipment to check whether 
</p>
<p>the RAM specifications are met. Performance and RAM characteristics must be 
</p>
<p>also checked prior to specific equipment acceptance. Otherwise, the equipment 
</p>
<p>may fail to deliver a reasonable level of service.
</p>
<p>The specifications for RAM, will be based on technical input and judgement 
</p>
<p>from knowledge of the type of equipment concerned and the service conditions 
</p>
<p>and requirements involved. The tests will involve operating the equipment for a 
</p>
<p>trial period during which equipment performance, faults, failures, and mainte-
</p>
<p>nance activities are recorded and analyzed. The results should then be compared 
</p>
<p>with the required specifications, and may be used to compare competing equip-
</p>
<p>ment. Faults may be reduced and performance improved as trials proceed, but 
</p>
<p>finally a judgement is made as to whether the equipment is satisfactory in relation 
</p>
<p>to the specifications, and meets criteria for quality and safety.
</p>
<p>Trials also provide information regarding logistic support requirements includ-
</p>
<p>ing maintenance and replacement policies and spare parts planning. It is important 
</p>
<p>to make data-supported decisions on all these topics wherever possible.
</p>
<p>21.3.1  Mean Time Between Failures
</p>
<p>The most commonly used measure of reliability is the Mean Time Between 
</p>
<p>Failures or MTBF. This is defined as follows:
</p>
<p>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is the average time for which an equip-
</p>
<p>ment operates between failures occurring.
</p>
<p>21.3.2  Failure Rate
</p>
<p>The failure rate is the number of failures per unit of operating time.
</p>
<p>3 ISO 55001 Clause 10.2 Preventive action: &ldquo;The organization shall establish processes to &hellip; 
identify potential failures &hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>375
</p>
<p>21.3.3  Failure
</p>
<p>A failure is a deterioration of an item such that it is no longer able to perform 
</p>
<p>its required function. However, some failures may have only a minor impact on 
</p>
<p>equipment operation. Care must be taken in deciding what constitutes a failure in 
</p>
<p>any analysis or in any form of reliability trial.
</p>
<p>21.4  Design for Reliability4
</p>
<p>The design of equipment should reflect the level of reliability required by the 
</p>
<p>application specification. At the design phase, techniques such as Failure Mode 
</p>
<p>and Effects Analysis (FMEA) are applied to assess how an item may fail and to 
</p>
<p>subsequently reduce the risk of failure. Besides the design of the equipment itself, 
</p>
<p>the reliability of a system is influenced by the degree of redundancy. In systems 
</p>
<p>where high reliability is required, this is often achieved by having components, 
</p>
<p>assemblies, or units working in parallel, or on standby, so that if one item fails the 
</p>
<p>system remains operational.
</p>
<p>21.5  Managing the Reliability of In-service Assets
</p>
<p>Beyond the initial acquisition stage, where reliability will depend largely on 
</p>
<p>design factors, reliability should be managed throughout the life of an asset. 
</p>
<p>Many techniques have been devised to assist in this process and some of these 
</p>
<p>are outlined in this section. Figure 21.1 gives a flowchart relating to the manage-
</p>
<p>ment and improvement of reliability. The techniques named will be considered 
</p>
<p>in this chapter. Full details are given in books dedicated to reliability, such as 
</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connor.5
</p>
<p>21.5.1  Operator Records and Incident Reports
</p>
<p>Operator logs or records form a useful source of information about equipment 
</p>
<p> performance and condition. The frequency and extent of delays, losses, or faults 
</p>
<p>can be determined directly and in a timely manner from these logs. Following up

</p>
<p>on the data from operator logs can lead to the determination of causes of problems 
</p>
<p>and to action to eliminate or mitigate problems. Data from work requests and work 
</p>
<p>orders are also valuable and form the normal basis for failure investigation, but 
</p>
<p>operator logs are relatively neglected as a source of useful information for reliabil-

</p>
<p>21.5.2  Toolbox Meetings
</p>
<p>A toolbox meeting is a meeting of maintenance personnel with supervisors and 
</p>
<p>planners, typically held weekly as part of the maintenance planning and schedul-
</p>
<p>ing process. Feedback from maintainers forms a valuable source of information 
</p>
<p>relating to in-service asset reliability.
</p>
<p>Operator reports, incident 
</p>
<p>logs, failure reports and/or

</p>
<p>work requests and orders.

</p>
<p>21.5.3  Management Reaction
</p>
<p>The key step here is for management to listen to the feedback and to take 
</p>
<p> corresponding action where warranted. The reporting and management of inci-
</p>
<p>dents forms a basis for managing the performance and reliability of assets. There 
</p>
<p>is a saying that 30 incidents become one accident and 30 accidents become one 
</p>
<p>fatal accident. The causes of losses and incidents should be investigated and steps 
</p>
<p>taken to prevent future occurrence and to mitigate the consequences.
</p>
<p>Some specific pointers are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Staff to be given time, encouragement, and processes to record incidents, errors, 
</p>
<p>mistakes, faults, problems, defects, and failures;
</p>
<p>&bull; Retaining defective or broken parts and materials, e.g., in a tray or bucket, tak-
</p>
<p>ing photos including close-ups, making written records, refer FRACAS and 
</p>
<p>Root cause Analysis (RCA) techniques;
</p>
<p>&bull; Problems to be resolved or referred upward. Meetings to be arranged with shop 
</p>
<p>floor personnel to allow time for reporting and discussion;
</p>
<p>&bull; Technical support to be available to assess incidents, provide feedback and take 
</p>
<p>suitable action as appropriate;
</p>
<p>&bull; Do not just fix it, improve it so that it does not fail again;
</p>
<p>&bull; Bad news to be passed on as first priority;
</p>
<p>&bull; Systematically retain plant knowledge;
</p>
<p>&bull; Systematically disseminate plant knowledge;
</p>
<p>&bull; Minority opinions to be aired&mdash;suffer fools gladly, they may be right;
</p>
<p>&bull; Innovation and automation to be treated with caution.
</p>
<p>21.6  Failure Patterns and Causes
</p>
<p>Reliability analysis involves an understanding of patterns and causes which commonly 
</p>
<p>arise in relation to equipment failures. There are three common failure rate patterns:
</p>
<p>&bull; Burn-in or early life or infant mortality failures;
</p>
<p>&bull; Random failures, the term random meaning &ldquo;not age related&rdquo; in this context;
</p>
<p>&bull; Wearout;
</p>
<p>An example of these failure rate patterns is given in Fig. 21.2 which shows the 
</p>
<p>mortality rate of humans, with phases of infant mortality, a middle age range with 
</p>
<p>little variation in the mortality rate and finally, significantly increasing mortality 
</p>
<p>rates with age. The shape of this graph gives rise to the term &ldquo;bath tub&rdquo; curve.
</p>
<p>Determining the relevant pattern or patterns of failure for any particular asset, 
</p>
<p>or for any particular failure mode of an asset, may require statistical analysis. 
</p>
<p>Statistical analysis is outside the scope of this book, but some examples of the use 
</p>
<p>of failure patterns are now discussed.

</p>
<p>21.7  Failure Pattern Discussion
</p>
<p>21.7.1  Useful Life
</p>
<p>The useful life of an asset is the period where its reliability is high and the risk of 
</p>
<p> failure is low. Asset reliability can be relatively poor in the burn-in and wearout 
</p>
<p>phases. This means that we need to avoid the burn-in and wearout phases, and ensure 
</p>
<p>that random failures are kept to low levels. In general, we should investigate failures 
</p>
<p>of any type to determine the root cause and take steps to avoid repetition.
</p>
<p>The types of failure patterns are summarized in Fig. 21.3, which also indi-
</p>
<p>cates the types of causes. Not every item exhibits every pattern. If items are well 
</p>
<p>manufactured with good quality control, burn-in failures can be minimized. Also, 
</p>
<p>components should ideally be designed to last as long as, or longer than, the par-
</p>
<p>ent equipment, so that they do not reach the wearout stage. Thus many items will 
</p>
<p>not reach wearout, particularly if they suffer little or no physical stress. Electronic 
</p>
<p>items are typically in this category.
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.2  The pattern of human mortality
</p>
<p>Burn In Manufacture defect or faulty installation. Infant mortality.  
</p>
<p>Occurs early in life.  Rate decreases as early faults 
</p>
<p>eliminated.
</p>
<p>Random Not related to item age or service time , so rate 
</p>
<p>approximately constant through time. Often an external   
cause.  Can also be failure of a complex system with 
</p>
<p>many failure modes, such as electronic systems. 
</p>
<p>Wearout Rate is related to and increases with age or service life.  
</p>
<p>Causes include wear, ageing, corrosion, fatigue, creep, 
</p>
<p>embrittlement of plastics.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>379
</p>
<p>21.7.2  Burn-in Failures
</p>
<p>Burn-in failures are failures which occur early in the life of an asset, usually 
</p>
<p>related to some form of manufacture or installation defect.
</p>
<p>An example is a case where gearboxes on heavy haul trains were failing prema-
</p>
<p>turely. At first the cause was unknown, but an investigation revealed that some of 
</p>
<p>the gearboxes had fretting (wear patterns caused by frequent small movements) of 
</p>
<p>the bearings. This was traced to the fact that these gearboxes had been transported 
</p>
<p>by sea without the moving parts being secured. The fretting initiated serious wear 
</p>
<p>when the gearboxes were put into service. The problem was tackled by ensuring 
</p>
<p>that all the moving parts were secured before the gearboxes were transported from 
</p>
<p>the manufacturer to the user.
</p>
<p>Burn-in failures can be minimized by choosing well-developed and well-man-
</p>
<p>ufactured equipment and paying attention to acceptance testing and installation. 
</p>
<p>Stress screening of electronic components and assemblies is a technique used to 
</p>
<p>eliminate manufacture defects.
</p>
<p>21.7.3  Random Failure Examples
</p>
<p>Random failures are failures which occur as a result of events which are not 
</p>
<p>related to the age or service life of the asset. They usually have an external 
</p>
<p>cause.
</p>
<p>An example is in a sugar refinery where sugar is filtered through a cloth. 
</p>
<p>Failure of the cloth occurs when holes appear and it then has to be replaced. This 
</p>
<p>may seem at first to be a wearout phenomenon, but examination showed that the 
</p>
<p>failures of the cloth only occurred as a result of random inclusions of foreign mat-
</p>
<p>ter in the raw sugar and were not related to the service time of the cloth.
</p>
<p>In a manufacturing process, finned tube is made using an extrusion tool. Tools 
</p>
<p>are found to break after making varying lengths of tube. The average length of 
</p>
<p>tube per tool is 39 m. The operators suggest changing the tools just before this 
</p>
<p>average length is reached. However, statistical analysis showed that the failure rate 
</p>
<p>of the tools did not vary with the length extruded. Subsequent metallurgical analy-
</p>
<p>sis shows that breakage is due to random imperfections in the tube material and 
</p>
<p>not to wear of the tools.
</p>
<p>Reliability in the random failure phase can be enhanced by measures such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Operate the equipment responsibly
</p>
<p>&bull; Do not overload
</p>
<p>&bull; Keep everything neat, clean, and tidy
</p>
<p>&bull; Do not leave stuff blowing in the wind
</p>
<p>&bull; Keep up-to-date with all preventive maintenance
</p>
<p>&bull; Fix minor faults or degradations promptly.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>380 21 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability
</p>
<p>21.7.4  Wearout
</p>
<p>Wearout failures are failures which arise due to age- or service-related deteriora-
</p>
<p>tion. There are many examples of wearout failure modes. Common ones are the 
</p>
<p>wear of vehicle tyres and brake pads. Other examples are the degradation of lubri-
</p>
<p>cants with time and use; corrosion of steel structures; fatigue of railway tracks or 
</p>
<p>of any component subjected to repeated stress cycles.
</p>
<p>Assets should be retired (or refurbished) at the onset of wearout. This means 
</p>
<p>that we need to take measures to determine when wearout commences. In many 
</p>
<p>cases, this can be done by an inspection or condition monitoring process. If so, we 
</p>
<p>should use these techniques to determine a condition-based repair or replacement 
</p>
<p>policy.
</p>
<p>21.7.4.1  Statistical Analysis and Age Exploration
</p>
<p>In some situations where parts cannot be effectively or economically monitored, 
</p>
<p>we need to undertake statistical analysis or age exploration in order to determine 
</p>
<p>an appropriate repair or replacement policy. This can occur when parts are not 
</p>
<p>readily accessible, and particularly with failure modes such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; fatigue
</p>
<p>&bull; corrosion
</p>
<p>&bull; erosion
</p>
<p>&bull; insulation loss
</p>
<p>&bull; brittle decay of plastics.
</p>
<p>Statistical analysis involves recording the age or operating life to which items run 
</p>
<p>with and without failure and using techniques such as Weibull analysis6 to esti-
</p>
<p>mate the point at which a rise in the failure rate becomes significant.
</p>
<p>Age exploration involves running items to a gradually increasing age under con-
</p>
<p>trolled circumstances. If we do not want any in-service wearout failures&mdash;as for 
</p>
<p>example with an airframe&mdash;the age exploration can be carried out under controlled 
</p>
<p>laboratory conditions. Otherwise, we may have a selected population run under 
</p>
<p>low-risk circumstances to act as the age exploration group.
</p>
<p>21.7.5  Failure Mode Relative Importance
</p>
<p>Studies of failure mode frequencies have highlighted the fact that straight counts 
</p>
<p>of reported failures show larger numbers of random or burn-in failures than of 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>381
</p>
<p>wearout failures. However, the number of failures of a particular pattern does not 
</p>
<p>necessarily reflect the importance of those failure modes. In aircraft, for example, 
</p>
<p>wearout failure patterns of engine or structural components, are of much greater 
</p>
<p>importance than the failure of electronic components for which duplicate systems 
</p>
<p>exist. Our view of the importance of failure modes needs to take into account the 
</p>
<p>consequences of failure.
</p>
<p>21.7.6  Failure Interdependency
</p>
<p>An additional factor to be considered in relation to reliability is that failures are 
</p>
<p>not necessarily independent of one another. We can identify the following types of 
</p>
<p>interdependencies.
</p>
<p>&bull; Independent&mdash;physically and statistically, e.g., individual light globes.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cascade&mdash;failure of one item triggers failure of others. Example, in Auckland, 
</p>
<p>New Zealand, a power cable serving the central business district failed. Failure 
</p>
<p>of one cable then caused an overload on others leading to further failures and a 
</p>
<p>loss of all power to the district.
</p>
<p>&bull; Secondary damage&mdash;failure of one item impacts others, e.g., failure of wheel 
</p>
<p>bearing results in damage to suspension and steering mechanism.
</p>
<p>&bull; Dependent&mdash;Power supply failure affects both an operating pump and the 
</p>
<p>standby pump.
</p>
<p>&bull; Interrelated&mdash;Failure or degradation of one component causes another to wear 
</p>
<p>more rapidly, e.g., seal failure admits sand to bearing causing wear.
</p>
<p>21.7.6.1  Example
</p>
<p>In 2008, a pipeline bringing gas from under the sea at Varanus Island in 
</p>
<p>Western Australia ruptured and the gas ignited. The heat from the fire caused 
</p>
<p>three other adjacent pipelines to rupture and extended the fire, which took 
</p>
<p>2 days to put out. Western Australia&rsquo;s gas supplies were cut by about 30 % for 
</p>
<p>several months. Investigations showed that there was no corrosion coating on 
</p>
<p>the pipeline on either side of the rupture point (Engineers Australia, November 
</p>
<p>2008).

<p>A bad actor is an item which fails between turnarounds. Identify and try to elimi-
</p>
<p>nate bad actors.

<p>21.8  Failure Reporting and Corrective Action System 
</p>
<p>(FRACAS)7,8
</p>
<p>FRACAS is a formal system in which a range of specified parameters are reported 
</p>
<p>when a failure occurs, and a specified systematic approach to corrective action is 
</p>
<p>taken. US-MIL-STD-781 provides a description of FRACAS including details of 
</p>
<p>the type of report to be generated when a failure occurs. Factors to be included in 
</p>
<p>the report are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Failure/incident title
</p>
<p>&bull; Name of person raising the report
</p>
<p>&bull; Date and time of occurrence
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment type
</p>
<p>&bull; Site and location of occurrence
</p>
<p>&bull; Contingency action taken
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment odometer reading at failure
</p>
<p>&bull; Description of failure
</p>
<p>&bull; Description of effect of failure
</p>
<p>&bull; Repair action taken
</p>
<p>&bull; Operating conditions
</p>
<p>&bull; Cause of failure
</p>
<p>&bull; Date report raised
</p>
<p>&bull; Report of investigation
</p>
<p>&bull; Recommended actions to correct
</p>
<p>&bull; Follow-up testing or verification whether actions are effective
</p>
<p>&bull; Losses, time, cost
</p>
<p>&bull; Effects on safety
</p>
<p>&bull; Effects on environment
</p>
<p>&bull; Effects on production
</p>
<p>Nonroutine work orders should always be examined as a basis for cause  analysis 
</p>
<p>and for determining actions to correct faults. This will typically involve under-
</p>
<p>standing the equipment and possibly making changes, e.g., reduce overloading, 
</p>
<p>design changes, and maintenance changes. There should be follow-up testing or 
</p>
<p>verification to assess whether actions are effective.
</p>
<p>7 US-MIL-STD-781.
8 ISO 55001 Clause 10.1 Non-conformity and corrective action: &ldquo;When a nonconformity or 
incident occurs &hellip; the organization shall &hellip; react &hellip; take action &hellip; review &hellip; make changes if 
 necessary &hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>383
</p>
<p>21.9  Pareto Analysis
</p>
<p>Pareto analysis, as applied to equipment failures, means ranking failure modes by 
</p>
<p>frequency and cost. The most frequent and highest cost failure modes can then be 
</p>
<p>addressed. Figure 21.4 is an example of frequency ranking.
</p>
<p>In this application, the frequent problems with lights and wiring were reduced 
</p>
<p>by replacing metal filament lights with LED lights which did not completely fail 
</p>
<p>on impact, allowing the vehicle to continue in use until a convenient repair oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity. Driving discipline was also addressed, as was road condition.
</p>
<p>21.10  Failure Mode and Effects Analysis9,10
</p>
<p>FMEA also known as Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) 
</p>
<p>is a procedure used in assessing all the potential ways in which a product may 
</p>
<p>fail, assessing the causes and effects of failure, and carrying out a numerical 
</p>
<p>risk ranking. The technique is used in the design or manufacture of products. 
</p>
<p>Recommendations to correct the failures or mitigate the effects are then made and 
</p>
<p>acted upon. This technique can also be used in the investigation and correction of 
</p>
<p>in-service faults and failures.

<p>21.11 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)11
</p>
<p>Nullius in verba (Take nothing for granted). Motto of the Royal Society of London 
</p>
<p>(1660).
</p>
<p>RCA also known as Root Cause Failure Analysis (RCFA) is a formal approach 
</p>
<p>to determining the cause of failures, with the intention of preventing future occur-
</p>
<p>rences. The investigation of failures should be an organized activity involving 
</p>
<p>personnel trained in investigative techniques and local operators and maintainers. 
</p>
<p>There is some overlap between the concepts of Failure Recording and Corrective 
</p>
<p>Action (FRACAS) and RCA. RCA is normally applicable to failures which 
</p>
<p>require a degree of in-depth investigation.
</p>
<p>When a failure occurs the following actions should be taken:
</p>
<p>&bull; Record the incident or ongoing problem.
</p>
<p>&bull; Take action to manage the issue in the short term.
</p>
<p>&bull; Asses the level of response needed&mdash;does the effect justify a substantial invest-
</p>
<p>ment of time, effort, and money.
</p>
<p>&bull; A suitably skilled person should attend the site promptly.
</p>
<p>&bull; Preserve evidence, particularly broken parts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Record witness statements on site and in surrounding areas.
</p>
<p>&bull; Document observations, take photographs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Collect data and information systematically.
</p>
<p>&bull; Form an investigation team with specific roles and responsibilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Develop hypotheses and test with data.
</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare a report with findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
</p>
<p>&bull; Implement recommendations to prevent or reduce the likelihood of a repeat 
</p>
<p>incident.
</p>
<p>In investigating an incident the primary aim is finding out why the failure occurred 
</p>
<p>and in preventing it occurring again. Some useful questions to ask about a failed 
</p>
<p>item are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; What is it supposed to do?
</p>
<p>&bull; Do we really need it?
</p>
<p>&bull; How is it supposed to work?

<p>21.11.1  Five Whys
</p>
<p>Five Whys is a simple technique of RCA which can be quick and effective. It con-
</p>
<p>sists of asking &lsquo;Why&rsquo; something happened, and then why the previous thing hap-
</p>
<p>pened and so on, until an explanation is found. All the answers can be important.
</p>
<p>For example: Shipment of iron ore is delayed.

<p>First question: Why was the shipment delayed?
</p>
<p>First answer: The stacker-reclaimer was slow in loading the conveyor.
</p>
<p>Second question: Why was the stacker-reclaimer slow?
</p>
<p>Second answer: Some of the ore was out of position in the stockpile
</p>
<p>Third question: Why was some of the ore out of position?
</p>
<p>Third answer: The dozer did not position the ore in time.
</p>
<p>Fourth question: Why did the dozer not position the ore in time?
</p>
<p>Fourth answer: The dozer is too small to cope with the workload.
</p>
<p>Fifth question: Why is the dozer too small?
</p>
<p>Fifth answer: Because it was not upgraded when the stacker-reclaimer capacity 
</p>
<p>was increased.
</p>
<p>The next step is to make a business case for upgrading the dozer.

<p>21.11.2  Action and Condition Causes
</p>
<p>To investigate a failure in more depth involves assessing action causes and condi-
</p>
<p>tion causes. This can be tackled systematically as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Assemble knowledgeable team including users and maintainers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify symptoms of problem.
</p>
<p>&bull; Focus team on the specific problem.
</p>
<p>&bull; Define problem carefully. Which parts are affected, which are not affected.
</p>
<p>&bull; Under what conditions does the problem arise. Under what conditions does the 
</p>
<p>problem not arise.
</p>
<p>&bull; Develop Cause Tree. Use stickers on white board.
</p>
<p>&bull; Consider both immediate causes (action causes) and contributory circumstances 
</p>
<p>(condition causes).
</p>
<p>&bull; Avoid diverting to broader, unrelated issues.
</p>
<p>&bull; Brainstorm obtaining a solution, even if the root cause remains elusive.
</p>
<p>21.11.3  Example&mdash;Pump Failure
</p>
<p>In an underground copper mine, water gathers at the lower levels. For  mining 
</p>
<p>to proceed it is necessary to run pumps to clear the water. On a particular 
</p>
<p>occasion, flooding occurred at mine level 23. This resulted in 24 h lost produc-
</p>
<p>tion. Figure 21.5 shows the first cause tree developed in a RCA of this failure. 
</p>
<p>The failure was traced to a failure of pump number 14B. This was the Action 
</p>
<p>Cause of the flooding. The Condition Cause was found to be a high level of 
</p>
<p>mud in the water, which caused damage to the pump impeller, resulting in 
</p>
<p>pump failure.

</p>
<p>21.11.4  Brainstorming a Solution
</p>
<p>Some things to consider are as follows:
</p>
<p>1. Operation audit Has it happened before? Evaluate operating procedures and 
</p>
<p>practices. Is operation within design load or range. Consider cleanliness, 
</p>
<p> tidiness, and housekeeping.
</p>
<p>2. Maintenance audit Evaluate actual maintenance history, lubrication, wear, 
</p>
<p>alignment, balance, maintenance tasks and frequency, ease of access, tools, 
</p>
<p>procedures. Is there a symptom of a deeper problem?
</p>
<p>3. Design audit Evaluate design standards and rules, capacity, loading, move-
</p>
<p>ment, methods, materials, fits and tolerances, design principles, environmental 
</p>
<p>conditions.
</p>
<p>4. Management audit Is there satisfactory management of operation and 
</p>
<p>maintenance.
</p>
<p>21.11.5  Example&mdash;Pump Failure Continued
</p>
<p>Considering a solution to the pump failure problem, an essential action was to 
</p>
<p>repair the pump. However, although this would solve the immediate problem it did 
</p>
<p>not tackle the root cause. The root cause is shown in Fig. 21.6 as silt build up in 
</p>
<p>the bund at level 14.

<p>21.11.6  Actions to Remedy

</p>
<p>&bull; Repair pump
</p>
<p>&bull; Standby pump needed?
</p>
<p>&bull; Redesign sump to minimize silt?
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide small dredge to reduce excess silt when needed?
</p>
<p>General case: Formulate improvement plans. Involve the user. May require 
</p>
<p>changes to:
</p>
<p>&bull; operations;
</p>
<p>&bull; design;
</p>
<p>&bull; maintenance;
</p>
<p>&bull; equipment replacement;
</p>
<p>&bull; Use &ldquo;fool proofing&rdquo; (poka yoke) to help minimize errors in operation, set-up or 
</p>
<p>handling.
</p>
<p>Assess cost-effectiveness of improvement plans.
</p>
<p>&bull; Feed back results to workers&mdash;whatever the result may be.
</p>
<p>21.12  Condition Monitoring
</p>
<p>Condition monitoring involves using a diagnostic technique with the aim of 
</p>
<p>detecting degradation of a function or component before failure occurs, with a 
</p>
<p>view to taking remedial action to prevent in-service failure. Examples of monitor-
</p>
<p>ing techniques are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Vibration analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Oil analysis for lubrication quality and contamination
</p>
<p>&bull; Temperature monitoring
</p>
<p>&bull; Acoustic (sound) analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Ultrasonic detection for metallurgical weakness
</p>
<p>&bull; Insulation testing
</p>
<p>Condition monitoring is known as predictive maintenance because it attempts 
</p>
<p>to identify situations of impending failure and then to take action in advance so 
</p>
<p>that the failure does not occur. The savings in avoiding in-service failures can be 
</p>
<p>substantial when factors such as reduced unscheduled downtime, reduced labor, 
</p>
<p>reduced parts usage, and reductions in secondary damage are taken into account.
</p>
<p>Asset and maintenance managers need to be aware of the condition monitor-
</p>
<p>ing techniques which are most appropriate to the assets under their care. An early 
</p>
<p>work which describes many condition monitoring techniques is R.A. Collacott, 
</p>
<p>21.11 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>390 21 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mechanical Fault Diagnosis&rdquo;. Over recent years there have been many advances 
</p>
<p>in these techniques, particularly in terms of cheaper and more effective versions of 
</p>
<p>the diagnostic tools. Figure 21.7 shows a list of condition monitoring techniques 
</p>
<p>and the analogous technique used in medical diagnosis.
</p>
<p>21.12.1  Delay Time or P-F Interval
</p>
<p>An important factor in condition monitoring is that the detection of a degraded 
</p>
<p>state must occur with sufficient time in hand to rectify the situation before in-ser-
</p>
<p>vice failure occurs.
</p>
<p>An example is the case of wood rot of power poles. The condition of the poles 
</p>
<p>deteriorates slowly over a period of years and the condition of a pole can be meas-
</p>
<p>ured in terms of the amount of good wood left at any given stage. There is time to 
</p>
<p>inspect the poles at intervals of several years and to determine which poles will 
</p>
<p>need to be replaced soon.
</p>
<p>Considering the general case, Fig. 21.8 illustrates schematically the deterioration in 
</p>
<p>condition of an item from a &ldquo;No fault&rdquo; situation to one where a deteriorated condition 
</p>
<p>is detectable. The item is monitored at intervals &ldquo;I&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Delay time&rdquo; also known as 
</p>
<p>the P-F Interval, (time from Potential to actual Failure) is the time that the fault condi-
</p>
<p>tion takes to deteriorate into an actual failure. The idea is to set the monitoring interval 
</p>
<p>to no more than half the delay time, so that the fault will be detected as shown in 
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.8, in time for remedial action to be taken and the actual failure avoided.
</p>
<p>21.12.2  Condition Monitoring Applicability
</p>
<p>Condition monitoring is potentially applicable if the following conditions exist:
</p>
<p>&bull; Degradation becomes evident, indicating the existence of a potential failure 
</p>
<p>mode that allows the progress of the failure conditions to be identified.
</p>
<p>&bull; Consistent failure patterns allow fault information to be diagnosed accurately.

<p>391
</p>
<p>&bull; The time interval from the onset of potential failure to total failure (P-F interval 
</p>
<p>or Delay time) is sufficiently long to accommodate the monitoring interval and 
</p>
<p>the time taken for remediation/rectification. The monitoring interval is typically 
</p>
<p>set to less than half of the P-F interval.
</p>
<p>&bull; Condition monitoring data can be collected with a high degree of repeatability.
</p>
<p>21.12.3  Limitations
</p>
<p>Limitations of condition monitoring occur when the time taken for a failure mode 
</p>
<p>to progress from satisfactory operation to failure is short. This can occur with 
</p>
<p>fatigue failures or brittleness of plastics. Another example is oil or grease condi-
</p>
<p>tion where degradation can be rapid in hot or dusty environments.
</p>
<p>21.12.4  Condition Monitoring Effectiveness
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a predictive maintenance technique can be assessed in terms of the 
</p>
<p>reduction in in-service failures that it achieves. If in-service failures are still occurring, 
</p>
<p>then the monitoring technique is of limited effectiveness and may need to be improved 
</p>
<p>or supplemented by other actions such as age or service life-based replacement.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; nature of condition monitoring can lead to an assumption that 
</p>
<p>it is 100 % effective, when in fact the effectiveness may be much lower than this. 
</p>
<p>It is best to record data on the numbers of in-service failures which occur with the 
</p>
<p>regime in place as a check on the effectiveness of the scheme.
</p>
<p>Condition monitoring is a diagnostic tool and can have &ldquo;Type 1&rdquo; errors where 
</p>
<p>an incipient failure is not detected and &ldquo;Type 2&rdquo; errors where a degraded condition 
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.8  Condition monitoring interval and delay time

<p>21.12 Condition Monitoring</p>
<p/>

<p>392 21 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability
</p>
<p>is incorrectly indicated, or the wrong failure mode is diagnosed. For example, 
</p>
<p>vibration analysis may not pinpoint the actual problem but can lead to time wasted 
</p>
<p>in dismantling areas where there is no fault. Condition monitoring is very effective 
</p>
<p>in many situations, provided that we are aware of its possible limitations.
</p>
<p>21.12.5  Applications of Condition Monitoring
</p>
<p>Some common applications are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Vibration monitoring of rotating equipment. Rotating machines when run-
</p>
<p>ning correctly have moderate levels of vibration at certain frequencies, rather 
</p>
<p>like a human heartbeat. The pattern of vibration is known as the vibration sig-
</p>
<p>nature. Significant variations from the normal vibration pattern can be detected 
</p>
<p>by instruments and warn that failure is imminent. Action can then be taken to 
</p>
<p>check the machine and avoid a catastrophic failure.
</p>
<p>&bull; Thermographic inspection of electrical and mechanical equipment utilizing 
</p>
<p>infrared measuring equipment. This detects variations from normal operating 
</p>
<p>temperatures. For example, this can indicate a poor connection, insulation loss, 
</p>
<p>or an open circuit in the electrical case and overheating of bearings or blockages 
</p>
<p>or leaks in pipes or heat exchangers in a mechanical case.
</p>
<p>&bull; Wall thickness testing of piping and pressure vessels. This uses ultrasonic test 
</p>
<p>equipment.
</p>
<p>&bull; Lubricant analysis for lubricating properties and impurities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Hot circuit fluid analysis.
</p>
<p>&bull; Trend analysis of cathodic protection and corrosion probes.
</p>
<p>21.13  Reliability Centered Maintenance12,13
</p>
<p>Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a systematic method for  establishing 
</p>
<p>a maintenance policy. This technique is suited to situations where an in-depth 
</p>
<p>analysis is required. The application of RCM must involve an appropriate level 
</p>
<p>of engineering authority, consistent with the technology of the application for 
</p>
<p>which the maintenance policy is being developed. At the same time, the value of 
</p>
<p>this technique lies in combining the knowledge of maintenance, engineering, and 
</p>
<p>management staff in a structured process, providing benefits from the in-depth 
</p>
<p>communication involved.

</p>
<p>RCM provides a logical link between the equipment function, the need for 
</p>
<p> reliability and safety, and the related maintenance policy. Figure 21.9 illustrates this.
</p>
<p>21.13.1  Information Sources
</p>
<p>Sources of information used in RCM include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Manufacturers documentation;
</p>
<p>&bull; Experienced maintenance personnel, particularly older staff, planners and 
</p>
<p>supervisors;
</p>
<p>&bull; Records of previous maintenance activities;
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance and technical support staff;
</p>
<p>&bull; Suppliers;
</p>
<p>&bull; Consultants;
</p>
<p>&bull; Experienced operators;
</p>
<p>&bull; Operations records;
</p>
<p>&bull; Manufacturers local representative;
</p>
<p>&bull; Other users of same equipment;
</p>
<p>&bull; Statutory requirements; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Engineering standards and published guidelines.
</p>
<p>21.13.2  Guidelines
</p>
<p>&bull; Select equipment to be analyzed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Form an &ldquo;expert team&rdquo; consisting of maintenance technicians, planners, super-
</p>
<p>visors, and engineers to carry out the RCM activity. A facilitator familiar with 
</p>
<p>the RCM process will be needed.

</p>
<p>&bull; Participation by the technicians is essential to achieve the &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo; necessary 
</p>
<p>for successful implementation of the results.
</p>
<p>&bull; Take a fresh view, but be aware of existing maintenance plans and accept them 
</p>
<p>as part of the RCM process where reasonable.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have an agreed format for the result using standard forms.
</p>
<p>&bull; Create and implement complete results in moderate-sized chunks.
</p>
<p>&bull; Do not go beyond the level of detail or design that your organization will 
</p>
<p>handle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Consider the resources required to carry out each task as it is created, both at the 
</p>
<p>task level and at an aggregate level.
</p>
<p>The flow chart in Fig. 21.10 summarizes the RCM procedure.
</p>
<p>21.13.3  Function and Functional Failure
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;function&rdquo; of a machine or component is anything which it is supposed to do.
</p>
<p>For example, the function of a brake is to slow and stop something. The func-
</p>
<p>tion should include relevant technical values, e.g., a brake should stop a vehi-
</p>
<p>cle with specified load and speed within a specified distance. Understanding the 
</p>
<p>function of a component is the key to understanding the reason for maintaining it 
</p>
<p>correctly.
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.10  Reliability centered maintenance flowchart</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>395
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;functional failure&rdquo; is failure to perform a required function. This may not 
</p>
<p>mean that an item fails in a complete physical sense.
</p>
<p>In deciding the functions of an item, consider:
</p>
<p>Basic role of the system, assembly or component, e.g., to provide power (engine), 
</p>
<p>to transmit power (transmission), to hold vehicle in stationary position (hand 
</p>
<p>brake).
</p>
<p>Technical values associated with the function, e.g., engine to provide up to 
</p>
<p>150 kW of power, handbrake to hold vehicle on 1 in 4 gradient when vehicle 
</p>
<p>loaded to 2 tonnes gross.
</p>
<p>Efficiency/economy of function, e.g., fuel consumption not greater than 10 l per 
</p>
<p>100 km.
</p>
<p>Structural integrity,
</p>
<p>Environmental integrity,
</p>
<p>Appearance and comfort,
</p>
<p>Control,
</p>
<p>Safety,
</p>
<p>Whether there are required functions that are not provided, and
</p>
<p>Whether there are redundant functions.
</p>
<p>21.13.4  Functional Failure
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;functional failure&rdquo; is failure to provide a required function.
</p>
<p>Example: A pump in a given application is needed to pump water at 1,000 l/min. 
</p>
<p>If the performance of the pump has deteriorated to the point where it can no longer 
</p>
<p>deliver water at this rate, then the pump has a functional failure.
</p>
<p>The pump may be working in a technical sense but it is failing to provide the 
</p>
<p>required function. Of course it is also a &ldquo;functional failure&rdquo; if the pump fails 
</p>
<p>completely.
</p>
<p>21.13.5  Failure Mode
</p>
<p>For each function of the selected item, we consider how it might or does fail.
</p>
<p>We also identify all minor faults, undesirable conditions or degraded states, 
</p>
<p>which may eventually progress into actual failures, for example:
</p>
<p>&bull; low oil level
</p>
<p>&bull; loose drive belt
</p>
<p>&bull; worn brush on electric motor
</p>
<p>&bull; leaking pipe.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>396 21 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability
</p>
<p>21.13.6  Effects
</p>
<p>For each failure or fault mode, we next consider the potential effects. The logic 
</p>
<p>check sheet indicates five types of effects which must be considered:
</p>
<p>&bull; Safety
</p>
<p>&bull; Environment
</p>
<p>&bull; Operating or Production Loss
</p>
<p>&bull; Hidden Failures
</p>
<p>&bull; Degradation.
</p>
<p>21.13.7  Hidden Failures
</p>
<p>Hidden failures are failures which are not readily apparent to the operator of the 
</p>
<p>equipment. Typically, they occur in protective devices. For example, if a burglar 
</p>
<p>alarm fails, it will not be apparent, unless the alarm is tested, or a burglary occurs.
</p>
<p>To check for a hidden failure it will be necessary to carry out an inspection or 
</p>
<p>test of some kind.
</p>
<p>21.13.8  Tasks
</p>
<p>The next step in RCM is to determine maintenance tasks or actions which address 
</p>
<p>the situation created by the failure modes and effects. RCM requires a review of 
</p>
<p>all tasks to ensure that all the effects identified for a failure mode are met. The 
</p>
<p>review of tasks may lead to the introduction of, or adjustments to such aspects as,
</p>
<p>&bull; inspection intervals,
</p>
<p>&bull; lubrication intervals,
</p>
<p>&bull; checks and adjustments,
</p>
<p>&bull; component or equipment replacement intervals or guidelines,
</p>
<p>&bull; condition monitoring regimes,
</p>
<p>&bull; repair pools and rotables provision,
</p>
<p>&bull; repair kits,
</p>
<p>&bull; check lists,
</p>
<p>&bull; troubleshooting guides,
</p>
<p>&bull; accessibility,
</p>
<p>&bull; tools,
</p>
<p>&bull; spare parts optimization,
</p>
<p>&bull; field repair teams provisioning,
</p>
<p>&bull; workshop facilities provisioning,
</p>
<p>&bull; redesign, and
</p>
<p>&bull; level of repair policy (Fig. 21.11).</p>

</p>
<p>21.13.9  Reliability Centered Maintenance Conclusion
</p>
<p>In conclusion, we see that RCM provides a systematic method for establishing 
</p>
<p>a maintenance policy. The value of the technique lies in combining the knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of maintenance, engineering, and management staff in a structured process, 
</p>
<p> providing benefits from the in-depth communication involved. RCM provides a 
</p>
<p>logical link between the equipment function, the need for reliability and safety and 
</p>
<p>the related maintenance policy.
</p>
<p>21.14  Maintenance Policy Review
</p>
<p>Most organizations already have maintenance policies in place. Maintenance 
</p>
<p>Policy Review is a procedure for checking the suitability of the existing mainte-
</p>
<p>nance tasks. It is also known as Preventive Maintenance Optimization, or Reverse 
</p>
<p>RCM. An RCM-style analysis is created, with the existing maintenance tasks being 
</p>
<p>taken as a starting point and then considering the failure modes they are intended 
</p>
<p>to address. This particularly includes inspection tasks. The analysis considers:
</p>
<p>&bull; the existing maintenance tasks,
</p>
<p>&bull; the range of failure modes that particular tasks are addressing,
</p>
<p>&bull; how effective is each task,
</p>
<p>&bull; are some tasks redundant,
</p>
<p>&bull; is there is duplication or overlapping of tasks,
</p>
<p>&bull; are there ways of combining tasks to reduce duplication or frequency,
</p>

<p>398 21 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability
</p>
<p>&bull; are other tasks needed, and
</p>
<p>&bull; can improvements be made to the effectiveness of remaining tasks.
</p>
<p>There is a tendency for maintenance tasks to multiply over time in response to par-
</p>
<p>ticular failures or incidents and this can result in overmaintenance. Maintenance 
</p>
<p>Policy Review can offset this trend. It is important that the basic logic of normal 
</p>
<p>RCM is respected, particularly in regard to safety considerations.
</p>
<p>21.14.1  Example
</p>
<p>At a minerals processing site, material is handled by crushers, conveyer belts, 
</p>
<p>screens, and mills. A Maintenance Policy Review finds that several different 
</p>
<p>groups (operators, mechanics, electricians, and condition monitoring techni-
</p>
<p>cians) are carrying out overlapping inspection processes. A rationalization of these 
</p>
<p>processes produces considerable savings. The role of the operators is extended 
</p>
<p>through additional training and the provision of basic monitoring equipment and 
</p>
<p>time is freed up for the technicians to handle higher level work.
</p>
<p>21.15  Availability
</p>
<p>Availability is the proportion of time for which a machine is available for use. The 
</p>
<p>simplest concept of availability applies when we have a single machine which is 
</p>
<p>required continuously and which has an associated repair crew. The state of the 
</p>
<p>machine is either &ldquo;Up,&rdquo; that is running or available to run, or &ldquo;Down,&rdquo; that is, 
</p>
<p>failed. When the machine fails the repair crew repairs it. Figure 21.12 illustrates 
</p>
<p>the situation. Availability of the machine is defined in the following terms.
</p>
<p>Availability is the proportion of time for which a machine is available for use.
</p>
<p>Down Time is time when equipment is not operable.
</p>
<p>Up Time is time for which equipment is operable.
</p>
<p>Availability = Up Time/(Up Time + Down Time) = Up Time/Total Time

<p>Given the mean time between failures MTBF of the machine and the mean time to

</p>
<p>tors which contribute to the achievement of availability are shown in Fig. 21.14.
</p>
<p>21.15.2  Cost of Downtime
</p>
<p>The potential types of cost associated with failure are indicated in Fig. 6.1. The 
</p>
<p>cost of failure and of downtime is the basic driver for maintenance and influ-
</p>
<p>ences priorities for maintenance. The cost of downtime is hard to quantify, and 
</p>
<p>varies considerably with circumstances, but awareness of the cost of downtime is 
</p>
<p>important to good management, because it provides a sound basis for evaluating 
</p>
<p>the trade-off between maintenance costs, capital equipment expenditure, and busi-
</p>
<p>ness profitability. If managers are not aware of the cost of downtime, they may see 
</p>
<p>maintenance as purely a cost element which can be cut without regard to flow on 
</p>
<p>effects.
</p>
<p>21.15.3  Availability When Needed
</p>
<p>Many systems do not require 100 % availability all of the time. Preventive mainte-
</p>
<p>nance can be scheduled to take place in times of low demand. Breakdown mainte-

</p>
<p>support can be increased in periods of high demand so as to minimize the effects 
</p>
<p>of outages.
</p>
<p>For example, in electricity generation, demand fluctuates with time of day 
</p>
<p>and season of year. Capacity required can be forecast, and individual generators 
</p>
<p>brought on stream at particular times. Equipment shutdowns are scheduled for 
</p>
<p>periods of low demand. Available capacity is normally designed to cover the unex-
</p>
<p>pected loss of the largest generator currently running. Similar considerations apply 
</p>
<p>in transmission systems. This approach is known as n &minus; 1 redundancy, indicating 
</p>
<p>that the loss of one component should not cause a loss of supply.
</p>
<p>21.16  Availability Related to Total Time
</p>
<p>Most equipment does not operate on a 24 h 7 days a week basis, and there are 
</p>
<p>scheduled times of nonuse, scheduled maintenance times, and other times when 
</p>
<p>machinery is not required. The definition of availability in these circumstances 
</p>
<p>requires a consideration of how the total time available is partitioned. Figure 21.15 
</p>
<p>illustrates this.
</p>
<p>The following availability measures can then be defined.
</p>
<p>There is also a possibility of opportunistic maintenance in nonscheduled time.
</p>
<p>21.17  Maintenance Effectiveness
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of maintenance relates to how well the effort put into main-
</p>
<p>tenance translates into reliable and available equipment. Figure 21.16 shows 
</p>
<p>factors that influence the effectiveness of maintenance. The skill of the mainte-
</p>
<p>nance workforce in relation to the tasks on hand is a key factor, and training and 
</p>
<p>Availability (When Required) = 1 &minus; M3/(SP &minus; NR)

<p>402 21 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability
</p>
<p>continuity on the job are therefore important. Possibly, the most important factor 
</p>
<p>of all is the degree of commitment or motivation of the workforce&mdash;an indicator 
</p>
<p>of lack of commitment is absenteeism. The degree of commitment is influenced by 
</p>
<p>the other factors in the figure, since lack of cleanliness, poor planning, inherently 
</p>
<p>unreliable equipment, and poor logistic support will lead to poor morale.
</p>
<p>Maintenance personnel generally welcome being involved in work on improving 
</p>
<p>reliability and maintainability, such as RCA, diagnosis, and condition monitoring. 
</p>
<p>However, a tendency to replace basic maintenance by sophisticated but ineffective 
</p>
<p>activities should be resisted.

<p>21.18  Maintenance Load
</p>
<p>The maintenance load generated by a system is the resource requirement for main-
</p>
<p>tenance of the system per unit of service. For example, for an aircraft this is the 
</p>
<p>maintenance hours per flying hour. The maintenance load will consist of routine 
</p>
<p>and nonroutine activities, of which the latter can only be estimated on the basis of 
</p>
<p>some operating experience. It may also be expressed in cost terms, such as mainte-
</p>
<p>nance $ per flying hour.
</p>
<p>21.19  Maintenance Regime
</p>
<p>It is important to have an established maintenance regime, and for this to be docu-
</p>
<p>mented, adhered to, and records kept. Conforming to the manufacturers recom-
</p>
<p>mendations, meeting all regulatory requirements, and staying within warranty 
</p>
<p>claim boundaries are good basic ideas. Variations from this need a reason. Be con-
</p>
<p>fident about what you can tell the judge in a court case.
</p>
<p>The maintenance regime specifies the details of what maintenance is done rou-
</p>
<p>tinely, by whom and at what frequency, and the procedures for both routine and 
</p>
<p>nonroutine maintenance.
</p>
<p>21.20  Maintainability14,15
</p>
<p>Maintainability relates to the ease or difficulty with which an item can be repaired 
</p>
<p>when it fails. A basic factor in maintainability is the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR). 
</p>
<p>This is defined as the average length of active time taken to repair an item which 
</p>
<p>has failed. An item which is easy to repair will have a short MTTR, and an item 
</p>
<p>which is hard to repair will have a longer MTTR. As a more formal measure, it is 
</p>
<p>the proportion of repairs that are completed within a specified maintenance time 
</p>
<p>constraint.
</p>
<p>21.20.1  Design for Maintainability
</p>
<p>Maintainability is a design factor which competes with other requirements such as 
</p>
<p>low initial cost, good performance, and reliability. For example, it may improve 
</p>
<p>the maintainability of a chemical reactor vessel to have an access plate in a certain 
</p>
<p>14 IEC 60300 3 10 Maintainability.

</p>
<p>spot, but this may also increase the cost and reduce performance because of 
</p>
<p>reduced allowable pressure, and may decrease reliability, because of the need for 
</p>
<p>seals which are less reliable than a solid wall. In designing for maintainability, the 
</p>
<p>general aims are to reduce total maintenance load and to reduce downtime when it 
</p>
<p>occurs.
</p>
<p>A good design will minimize and simplify maintenance tasks, and provide pre-
</p>
<p>dictability in maintenance requirements. Specific features which promote good 
</p>
<p>maintainability include ease of access by technicians; visibility; ease of testing; 
</p>
<p>interchangeability of components or modules; provision of good maintenance 
</p>
<p>documentation and diagnostics. Some further details of techniques used to provide 
</p>
<p>good maintainability are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Access Provide good access for maintenance.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Access plates.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Use hinged panels.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Use roll out drawers&hellip;
</p>
<p>&bull; Modularise Example: Maintainability of an electronic device may be improved 
</p>
<p>by making it in the form of detachable boards plugged into a base. The plugs, 
</p>
<p>however, may have low reliability when compared with permanent joints.
</p>
<p>&bull; Minimize need for special tools.
</p>
<p>&bull; Minimize range of tools required.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide failure signals, warning signals, and built-in sensors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide troubleshooting, diagnostic aids and plans.
</p>
<p>&bull; Built-in monitoring points.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide good instrumentation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Label assemblies.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide operation and calibration information on labels.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use easily replaceable, expendable components, e.g., flywire door.
</p>
<p>&bull; Prevent faulty assembly (poka yoke).
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide handles or other lifting points.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide castors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Lubrication points visible and accessible.
</p>
<p>&bull; Adjustment points visible and accessible.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide spare fuses or equivalent reset.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide adequate illumination.
</p>
<p>&bull; Redundancy, e.g., standby light bulb with switch.
</p>
<p>&bull; Help desk, online maintenance support, and portable computer with workshop 
</p>
<p>manuals and drawings, etc.
</p>
<p>An example of poor design for maintainability is shown in Fig. 21.17.16

</p>
<p>21.21  Maintainability Measure
</p>
<p>In order to specify, measure, and compare maintainability of items, we need a 
</p>
<p>definition of maintainability as a measurable quantity. For this purpose, we define 
</p>
<p>maintainability as a probability that an item can be restored to operating condi-
</p>
<p>tion within a specified interval of time, when maintenance is performed in accord-
</p>
<p>ance with prescribed procedures and resources. The following definition is adapted 
</p>
<p>from Society of Automotive Engineers Standard SAE JA1010.
</p>
<p>Maintainability is the probability that an item will be repaired within a speci-
</p>
<p>fied time, referred to as the maintenance time constraint.
</p>
<p>The Maintenance Time Constraint is set in relation to operational circum-
</p>
<p>stances, such as, aircraft turn around time. As a property of the item itself, 
</p>
<p>maintainability is related to Active Repair Time. As a property of a system, 
</p>
<p> maintainability is related to total downtime.
</p>
<p>The average value of the time to repair is known as the MTTR. If the distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of the time to repair is negative exponential, the repair rate is constant and is 
</p>
<p>the reciprocal of the MTTR. Define
</p>
<p>MTTR = Mean Time to repair
</p>
<p>&micro; = Repair Rate
</p>
<p>Then for the exponential model we have
</p>
<p>&micro; = 1/MTTR
</p>
<p>M = 1 &minus; exp(&minus;&micro;t)
</p>
<p>where M is the Maintainability and t is the Maintenance Time Constraint. Thus, 
</p>
<p>if we have data from which we can estimate the Mean Time To Repair, then we

<p>can calculate the corresponding maintainability with reference to our maintenance

<p>21.22  Desert Song
</p>
<p>&ldquo;So where did you go after Norway, Pop?&rdquo; asked Jock on his next visit to his 
</p>
<p>granddad. Jock really enjoyed hearing his Pop&rsquo;s old stories but it was hard to get 
</p>
<p>him going on them.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of stuff are you working on now?&rdquo; said Pop, diverting the question.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about sustaining our in-service assets, but I think you would call it main-
</p>
<p>tenance,&rdquo; said Jock; and after a pause Pop decided there were some things about 
</p>
<p>maintenance that Jock ought to know.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in North Africa,&rdquo; said Pop. &ldquo;You know those films with John Wayne 
</p>
<p>firing a machine gun from the hip from a moving tank?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jock
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s not like that. The fact is that tanks get stuck or break down pretty 
</p>
<p>easily. There is always soft sand or mud, unexpected gullies, rocks or concrete in 
</p>
<p>the wrong place. It&rsquo;s surprising how easily they can throw a track or strip the final 
</p>
<p>drive or just get into a spot where they can&rsquo;t move. And that&rsquo;s not counting enemy 
</p>
<p>action or mines. After a day&rsquo;s fighting in the desert dozens of tanks on both sides 
</p>
<p>would be broken down somewhere. But somehow the Germans had most of theirs 
</p>
<p>up and running again by next morning. It had us flummoxed at first.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found that they had the field maintenance angle well worked out. They 
</p>
<p>had recovery vehicles with a winch and a spade which could pull a tank out of any 
</p>
<p>spot, and repair teams trained and equipped with all the right tools and spares.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time we didn&rsquo;t even have a mechanical and electrical engineering corps 
</p>
<p>at all. We just had fitters attached to the supply regiment.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we loved their petrol cans&mdash;jerry cans we called them. Our cans were so 
</p>
<p>flimsy that they would start leaking at the drop of a hat.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty bad eh,&rdquo; said Jock.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the war our staff blokes must have still been dreaming of the old  cavalry 
</p>
<p>days. They finally picked up on it after the Germans looked like they would make 
</p>
<p>it to Cairo. By Alamein we began to get some better equipment through and a 
</p>
<p>mechanical and electrical engineering corps was formed. Later when the Americans 
</p>
<p>came in with the half-tracks we got our forward repair teams running too.&rdquo;

<p>21.23.3  Cost of Downtime
</p>
<p>A single conveyor brings mineral ore from a mine to the surface. The conveyor 
</p>
<p>operates full time, which in this case is 48 weeks/year, 48 h/week. Extension of 
</p>
<p>this working period is not practicable. Experience shows that conveyor availabil-
</p>
<p>ity is 87 %. The sales value of production is $30,000,000 per year. Estimate the

</p>
<p>3. Define Failure Rate.
</p>
<p> Failure rate is the number of failures per unit of operating time.
</p>
<p>4. What are toolbox meetings and why are they important?
</p>
<p>  A toolbox meeting is a meeting of maintenance personnel with supervi-
</p>
<p>sors and planners, typically held weekly as part of the maintenance planning 
</p>
<p>and scheduling process. Feedback from maintainers forms a valuable source 
</p>
<p>of information relating to in-service asset reliability. The key step here is for 
</p>
<p>management to listen to the feedback and to take corresponding action where 
</p>
<p>warranted.
</p>
<p>5. What are the three common failure rate patterns?
</p>
<p> Burn-in, random, and wearout.
</p>
<p>6. What does FRACAS stand for?
</p>
<p> Failure Reporting and Corrective Action System.
</p>
<p>7. What is Pareto analysis?
</p>
<p>  Pareto analysis, as applied to equipment failures, means ranking failure 
</p>
<p>modes by frequency and cost.
</p>
<p>8. What is RCA?
</p>
<p>  RCA also known as RCFA is a formal approach to determining the cause of 
</p>
<p> failures, with the intention of preventing future occurrences.
</p>
<p>9. What is the five whys RCA technique?
</p>
<p>  Five Whys is a technique of RCA which consists of asking &ldquo;Why&rdquo; some-
</p>
<p>thing  happened, and then why the previous thing happened and so on, until an 
</p>
<p>explanation is found. All the answers can be important.
</p>
<p>10. What is Condition Monitoring?
</p>
<p>  Condition monitoring involves using a diagnostic technique with the aim of 
</p>
<p>detecting degradation of a function or component before failure occurs, with 
</p>
<p>a view to taking remedial action to prevent in-service failure.
</p>
<p>11. What is RCM?
</p>
<p> RCM is a systematic method for establishing a maintenance policy.
</p>
<p>12. What are hidden failures?
</p>
<p>  Hidden failures are failures which are not readily apparent to the operator of 
</p>
<p>the equipment.
</p>
<p>13. What is maintenance policy review?
</p>
<p>  Maintenance Policy Review is a procedure for checking the suitability of the 
</p>
<p>existing maintenance tasks.
</p>
<p>14. What is availability?
</p>
<p> Availability is the proportion of time for which a machine is available for use.
</p>
<p>15. What is meant by the maintenance load of an asset?
</p>
<p>  The maintenance load generated by a system is the resource requirement for 
</p>
<p> maintenance of the system per unit of service.
</p>
<p>16. Identify five factors which are important for good maintainability of an asset.
</p>
<p>&bull; Accessibility

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to outline the main factors involved in general 
</p>
<p>safety issues related to asset management. Safety critical systems are also consid-
</p>
<p>ered and techniques applicable to high-risk plant are introduced. Outcomes After 
</p>
<p>reading this chapter you will be aware of safety issues in two main areas. First 
</p>
<p>there are general safety concepts which apply to all physical assets. Second, there 
</p>
<p>are concepts such as safety integrity levels which apply to high-risk plant. You 
</p>
<p>will also be aware of the need for approved engineering standards to be applied by 
</p>
<p>competent personnel when developing repair specifications.
</p>
<p>22.1  Safety Requirements and Competence1
</p>
<p>Safety of users, operators, and maintainers is a general requirement for asset-based 
</p>
<p>systems.
</p>
<p>The management of safety requires the existence of an organizational  capability 
</p>
<p>that is competent to determine and apply the procedures necessary to meet the 
</p>
<p>related safety standards. Personnel must be aware of safety regulations that are 
</p>
<p>applicable to the relevant assets and their uses. These regulations will provide 
</p>
<p>guidelines for the conduct of operations and maintenance.
</p>
<p>Personnel engaged in the operation or maintenance of systems must adhere to 
</p>
<p>safety regulations and practices that are applicable. Competency is to be assured 
</p>
<p>by a combination of a qualifications framework, competency standards, and com-
</p>
<p>petency assessment procedures.
</p>
<p>Training programs are needed to deliver and support safety knowledge and 
</p>
<p>practices. Staff members require documented records which identify the train-
</p>
<p>ing and competencies achieved. Regular reviews or audits must be carried out of 
</p>
<p>safety competencies required and achieved by staff members. This provides the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to correct skill gaps if any.

<p>22.1.4  Tags
</p>
<p>Tags are used to as a sign that equipment is out of service or under repair. Tags 
</p>
<p>indicate that equipment is not to be switched on except by, or on the authority of, 
</p>
<p>the person who placed the tag.
</p>
<p>&bull; Out of service tag Placed on a switch indicating plant must not be switched on 
</p>
<p>because it needs repair. This is to prevent damage to plant.
</p>
<p>&bull; Personal danger tag Placed on a switch indicating that a (named) person is 
</p>
<p>working on the machine. This is to prevent personal injury.
</p>
<p>22.1.5  Danger Indications
</p>
<p>Operators and maintainers should have a general awareness of possible indicators 
</p>
<p>of danger and must be aware of what action to take in response to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Alarms
</p>
<p>&bull; Instruments indicating out of specification
</p>
<p>&bull; Leaks
</p>
<p>&bull; Flames
</p>
<p>&bull; Unexpected hot spots or cold spots
</p>
<p>&bull; Ice where no ice should be
</p>
<p>&bull; Vapor
</p>
<p>&bull; Loose equipment.
</p>
<p>22.2  Safety Critical Equipment (SCE) and Systems (SCS)
</p>
<p>Safety critical equipment or systems are items, the failure of which can endanger 
</p>
<p>human life or cause significant damage. These systems are normally subject to 
</p>
<p>statutory design and maintenance requirements. The engineering management of 
</p>
<p>such systems is addressed by the topic of Systems Engineering2 and by specific 
</p>
<p>topics relating to high-risk industries.3
</p>
<p>Safety critical systems require the application of techniques designed to assess 
</p>
<p>and assure the safe operation of high-risk plant. These systems occur in plant oper-
</p>
<p>ating at high or low temperatures and pressures, particularly where these contain 
</p>
<p>flammable, toxic, or hazardous materials, such as are found in the oil and gas, 
</p>
<p>chemical, and mineral processing industries. Inspection techniques apply to the 
</p>
<p>2 ISO 15288 Systems Engineering&mdash;Systems Life Cycle Processes.
3 IEC 61511-1 Functional safety, Safety Instrumented Systems.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>417
</p>
<p>pipes and pressure vessels, pumps, valves, compressors, hoses, and protective 
</p>
<p>devices. The same principles apply to other safety-related structures such as lift-
</p>
<p>ing and fairground equipment. The design of systems for safety involves the use of 
</p>
<p>items such as safety valves, redundant systems, back-up systems, and instrumenta-
</p>
<p>tion to warn of or close down dangerous situations. The use of protective clothing 
</p>
<p>and equipment and of safety procedures are also important in these applications.
</p>
<p>The integrity of safety critical systems involves some features over and above 
</p>
<p>those normally found for more general systems, although there is a considerable 
</p>
<p>overlap. Some specific points are covered in this section, however, this is a very 
</p>
<p>extensive subject and the intention is only to indicate the main concepts.
</p>
<p>22.2.1  Safety Critical Examples
</p>
<p>The following are some examples of safety critical equipment or systems:
</p>
<p>&bull; boilers, pressure vessels, and piping
</p>
<p>&bull; anything involving hazardous or toxic substances
</p>
<p>&bull; cranes, hoists, and elevating work platforms
</p>
<p>&bull; amusement devices
</p>
<p>&bull; lifts and escalators
</p>
<p>&bull; air conditioning units and cooling towers
</p>
<p>&bull; gas cylinders
</p>
<p>&bull; aviation systems
</p>
<p>&bull; railway systems
</p>
<p>&bull; nuclear industries
</p>
<p>&bull; storage tanks
</p>
<p>&bull; wells and wellhead equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; fire detection systems
</p>
<p>&bull; fire extinguishing systems
</p>
<p>&bull; instrumentation associated with safety.
</p>
<p>22.2.2  Risk-Based Inspection
</p>
<p>High-risk applications have substantial associated documentary and regulatory 
</p>
<p>systems. Those for the oil and gas industry are developed by the American 
</p>
<p>Petroleum Institute.4 The term Risk-Based Inspection is used in describing the 
</p>
<p>techniques which have been developed for addressing safety issues in these 
</p>
<p>industries.
</p>
<p>4 API 580 and API 581 Risk Based Inspection.
</p>
<p>22.2 Safety Critical Equipment (SCE) and Systems (SCS)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>418 22 Safety
</p>
<p>A key document is API 581 which describes Risk-Based Inspection. The API 
</p>
<p>standards provide methods for calculating operational limits for pressure vessels 
</p>
<p>and pipes depending on the conditions, typically temperature, pressure, and fluid 
</p>
<p>type, and the type of metal used. The technical factors considered include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Fatigue
</p>
<p>&bull; Overheating
</p>
<p>&bull; Thinning of pipes and vessels
</p>
<p>&bull; External damage
</p>
<p>&bull; Stress corrosion cracking
</p>
<p>&bull; Creep
</p>
<p>&bull; High-temperature hydrogen attack
</p>
<p>&bull; Brittle fracture
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment linings failure.
</p>
<p>22.2.3  Example&mdash;Distillation System
</p>
<p>Figure 22.1 shows a piping and instrumentation diagram (P &amp; ID) for a distilla-
</p>
<p>tion system. This system illustrates many of the features of safety critical systems 
</p>
<p>in that it involves liquids and gasses at high temperatures and pressures with an 
</p>
<p>extensive set of instruments and control systems. It is not intended here to consider 
</p>
<p>the working of this system in detail, but to use it as an example of a common type 
</p>
<p>Fig. 22.1  Distillation system</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>419
</p>
<p>of system that includes pressure vessels and piping, pumps, valves, instrumenta-
</p>
<p>tion, sensors for pressure, temperature, level and flow and related controls.
</p>
<p>22.2.4  Asset Integrity Management Plan (AIMP)
</p>
<p>Systems such as the distillation system shown in Fig. 22.1 require an asset integ-
</p>
<p>rity management plan. An Asset Integrity Management Plan (AIMP) is a manage-
</p>
<p>ment plan specifically aimed at ensuring the integrity of safety critical equipment. 
</p>
<p>It will include the following elements:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of Safety Critical Equipment (SCE) in the equipment register, to 
</p>
<p>include tag number, nameplate data.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) and Safety Integrity 
</p>
<p>Functions (SIF), which are systems or functions required to ensure safe opera-
</p>
<p>tions and safe response to any departure from normal operating conditions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Analysis of Safety Critical Equipment (SCE), SIS, and SIF to determine the 
</p>
<p>requirements for inspection and maintenance by activity and frequency.
</p>
<p>&bull; Development and application of integrity management and safety and operating 
</p>
<p>plans.
</p>
<p>&bull; Development of detailed procedures for inspection and maintenance work 
</p>
<p>including relevant test, performance or monitoring standards.
</p>
<p>&bull; Documentation of all procedures in the Asset Management Information System
</p>
<p>&bull; Management of these procedures through the Asset Management Information 
</p>
<p>System.
</p>
<p>22.2.5  Maintenance Specific to Safety Critical Equipment
</p>
<p>Activities will typically include the following. The frequencies may be based on 
</p>
<p>statutory requirements, reliability statistics, vendor recommendations, and best 
</p>
<p>practice.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) testing
</p>
<p>&bull; Functional tests (Emergency Shutdown (ESD) system, fire and gas detectors, 
</p>
<p>etc.)
</p>
<p>&bull; Critical Function Testing of Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)5 and Safety 
</p>
<p>Instrumented Functions (SIF)6

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>420 22 Safety
</p>
<p>&bull; Periodic running tests of standby equipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Mechanical and performance tests of any equipment (including fire pumps)
</p>
<p>&bull; Specify and apply testing and acceptance criteria for when repair is complete
</p>
<p>&bull; Reference vendor manuals that describe the maintenance and testing require-
</p>
<p>ments for the maintenance procedures
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance activities must preserve the integrity of the safety systems.
</p>
<p>22.2.6  Internal Corrosion Management
</p>
<p>Internal corrosion presents significant risk to pressure equipment and pipelines 
</p>
<p>particularly when corrosive substances are present. An internal corrosion control 
</p>
<p>plan is developed for each facility to establish control and mitigation methods 
</p>
<p>for managing corrosion, and also to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the 
</p>
<p> corrosion management systems that have been implemented.
</p>
<p>22.2.7  Protective Devices
</p>
<p>Safety Critical Equipment often has protective devices, the functions of which 
</p>
<p>need to be considered, such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Fences
</p>
<p>&bull; Guards
</p>
<p>&bull; Fuses
</p>
<p>&bull; Circuit breakers
</p>
<p>&bull; Limit switches
</p>
<p>&bull; Safety valves
</p>
<p>&bull; Emergency stop buttons
</p>
<p>&bull; Overload cut outs
</p>
<p>&bull; Standby systems
</p>
<p>&bull; Smoke detectors
</p>
<p>&bull; Alarms
</p>

</p>
<p>&bull; Governors
</p>
<p>&bull; Nonreturn valves
</p>
<p>&bull; Space alarms
</p>
<p>&bull; Sprinkler systems
</p>
<p>&bull; Tank vents</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>421
</p>
<p>&bull; Trips mechanical, electrical, other instrument
</p>
<p>&bull; Closed circuit television monitoring.
</p>
<p>These have functions such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Warn of danger
</p>
<p>&bull; Switch off or close down operation
</p>
<p>&bull; Relieve pressure
</p>
<p>&bull; Guard against foreign objects, e.g., hand in guillotine
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide standby service, e.g., emergency lighting.
</p>
<p>22.2.8  Record Keeping7
</p>
<p>Records of maintenance and function tests for safety critical equipment  typically 
</p>
<p>include the following information:
</p>
<p>&bull; Date of maintenance or function test
</p>
<p>&bull; Name of person who performed the maintenance or function test
</p>
<p>&bull; Serial number or other unique identifier of equipment (loop number, tag number 
</p>

<p>A layer of protection is something that reduces risk by a significant factor. In 
</p>
<p>Layer of Protection Analysis, layers are added until a desired level of safety is 
</p>
<p>reached. As an example consider a pressure vessel such as the distillation column 
</p>
<p>in Fig. 22.1. This could burst causing damage. To protect against this we have 
</p>
<p> layers of protection as shown in Fig. 22.2.
</p>
<p>The initial layer of protection (numbered 1 in Fig. 22.2) is provided by a gauge and 
</p>
<p>a warning light on a control panel. An operator should respond to this warning by tak-
</p>
<p>ing action to make the situation safe. If the operator does not act, an audible warning 
</p>
<p>signal (numbered 2) sounds to attract the attention of the operator. This is the second 
</p>
<p>layer of protection. If the operator still does not act, a safety valve opens (numbered 
</p>
<p>3), and if this does not work or does not reduce the pressure sufficiently, an automatic 
</p>
<p>7 AS 1851 (Clause 1.15) and AS 4428 (Clause 3.2, 4.5).

<p>local or general shutdown (numbered 4) occurs. Thus in total there are four layers of 
</p>
<p>protection protecting against potential damage caused by vessel overpressure.
</p>
<p>22.4  Safety Integrity Level (SIL)
</p>
<p>The Safety Integrity Level of a system is a measure of its relative safety as achieved 
</p>
<p>by the application of Layers of Protection. Analytical techniques such as fault tree 
</p>
<p>and event tree analysis may be applied in assessing a safety integrity level. Layers 
</p>
<p>of protection may be added until the required safety integrity level is reached.
</p>

</p>
<p>Ref: OSHA (USA) CFR 1919.119. API RP-752. Consider process hazards, includ-
</p>
<p>ing fire, explosion, and toxicity, in relation to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Site workers;
</p>
<p>&bull; Location of control room;
</p>
<p>&bull; Occupants of buildings;
</p>
<p>&bull; Nearby residents; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Access to emergency facilities.
</p>
<p>22.4.3  Fitness for Service Assessment
</p>
<p>Fitness for service criteria are to be established and applied to assets. These 
</p>
<p>will specify inspection and performance standards relating to such issues as the 
</p>
<p> following. Reference should be made to industry standards where appropriate. For 
</p>
<p> example, for the oil and gas industry, see API 579.
</p>
<p>&bull; Thickness of pipes and pressure vessels;
</p>
<p>&bull; Cracks, e.g., in structures, cranes;
</p>
<p>&bull; Misalignment;
</p>
<p>&bull; Vibration;
</p>
<p>&bull; Levels of corrosion or wear;
</p>
<p>&bull; Insulation resistance in transformers and other electrical equipment.
</p>
<p>22.5  Repairs Requiring Engineering
</p>
<p>If a particular repair is required but is not included in the existing maintenance 
</p>
<p>manual, then engineering will be required to design the repair. Examples are: the 
</p>
<p>extent of weld repairs for corrosion, the extent of what has to be replaced after 
</p>
<p>22.4 Safety Integrity Level (SIL)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>424 22 Safety
</p>
<p>unusual events, e.g., fire or impact damage; the need of cutting away structures for 
</p>
<p>access during equipment upgrades, a repair specification is required to cover the 
</p>
<p>safe restoration of the affected structures.
</p>
<p>A repair specification is a repair procedure which is authorized by a competent 
</p>
<p>authority for a specific maintenance activity. The competent authority can be an 
</p>
<p>individual, a company, or a group of qualified engineers. The data associated with 
</p>
<p>a repair generally consists of drawings and analysis that show compliance to regu-
</p>
<p>lations. The key task is to make certain that the repair specification does not vio-
</p>
<p>late any of the assumptions made in the design of the repaired engineering system.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to describe how tax and depreciation are 
</p>
<p>taken into account in asset management decisions. Asset managers work with 
</p>
<p>accounting and financial specialists and need familiarity with the terminology and 
</p>
<p>principles involved in dealing with issues of depreciation and taxation. Outcomes 
</p>
<p>After reading this chapter you will understand how after-tax profit is calculated, 
</p>
<p>how depreciation is calculated, and how asset management decisions are influ-
</p>
<p>enced by tax considerations.
</p>
<p>23.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we consider the effect of taxation, insofar as it influences deci-
</p>
<p>sions relating to asset management. In an ideal world, taxes should be structured 
</p>
<p>so that they have a neutral effect on business decisions, but in practice this is rarely 
</p>
<p>the case. Tax is a complex area and it is not intended to address it in full detail 
</p>
<p>here. The actual tax situation and the precise rules governing depreciation of a 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s assets are the province of the accountant and in practice accountancy 
</p>
<p>input into the related calculations is essential. However, for positive outcomes it is 
</p>
<p>beneficial if asset managers are familiar with the main issues and terminology of 
</p>
<p>company tax. We shall introduce, in a basic context, the main elements of tax and 
</p>
<p>depreciation, and the concept of tax credits as a way of allowing for the effects of 
</p>
<p>taxation.
</p>
<p>23.2  Capital Transactions
</p>
<p>Capital transactions involve the purchase or sale of fixed assets. They also include 
</p>
<p>expenditure on asset creating projects, such as construction of buildings and 
</p>
<p>infrastructure items such as roads or dams. Capital expenditure is not directly tax

</p>
<p>deductible in the year when the money is spent, as it is assumed that one kind 
</p>
<p>of asset (money) is being exchanged for another kind of asset (machinery, plant, 
</p>
<p>buildings or infrastructure) and that this transaction does not affect the value of the 
</p>
<p>firm. The depreciation of the asset is tax deductible, year by year over its effective 
</p>
<p>life.
</p>
<p>23.3  Depreciation
</p>
<p>Depreciation is an amount by which the value of a capital item is decreased for 
</p>
<p>accounting purposes, to approximately reflect its decreasing value with age. 
</p>
<p>Depreciation is deductible from income in the current year, in determining taxable 
</p>
<p>income, and hence in determining the tax to be paid.
</p>
<p>As an item depreciates, its reduced value is referred to as its &ldquo;book value&rdquo; or 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;written down value&rdquo;. The book value will not necessarily reflect the value of the 
</p>
<p>item in terms of its practical usefulness as an asset at a particular stage of life. It 
</p>
<p>is possible to adjust the book value to reflect market changes and changes in asset 
</p>
<p>condition outside the normal deterioration with age.
</p>
<p>23.3.1  Acquisition Cost
</p>
<p>The acquisition cost of an item is the full purchase price plus any costs of trans-
</p>
<p>porting, installing, relocating, or erecting the item.
</p>
<p>23.3.2  Book Value (or Written Down Value, WDV)
</p>
<p>The book value of an item is its Acquisition Cost minus the Cumulative 
</p>
<p>Depreciation to date.
</p>
<p>23.3.3  Effective Life
</p>
<p>Effective life is the age to which an item retains value, as specified in tax legisla-
</p>
<p>tion as a basis for depreciation allowances. Some examples of effective lives as 
</p>
<p>published by Australian tax authorities are shown in Fig. 23.1.
</p>
<p>The effective life of an item can be varied from the tax office standard in some 
</p>
<p>circumstances, provided this is supported by reasonable documentary evidence. 
</p>
<p>One example is when an item which is not fully depreciated becomes unusable 
</p>
<p>due to obsolescence. In this case the item may be written off, essentially the same </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>431
</p>
<p>as selling it for a zero resale value. The written down value is then claimable as a 
</p>
<p>tax credit. Profit will be reduced, but is best to accept this and to keep the profit 
</p>
<p>and the asset value in line with reality.
</p>
<p>23.3.4  Straight Line Depreciation
</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways of calculating depreciation and rules and rates vary 
</p>
<p>from time to time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Here we outline the princi-
</p>
<p>ples of two common methods. The simplest method of depreciation is straight line 
</p>
<p>depreciation. In straight line depreciation, the book value of the item decreases by 
</p>
<p>a constant amount each year over its effective life, starting from the acquisition 
</p>
<p>cost and falling to zero. The annual depreciation is given by the acquisition cost 
</p>
<p>divided by the effective life. Figure 23.2 illustrates straight line depreciation.
</p>
<p>23.3.5  Residual Value
</p>
<p>Rather than depreciating to zero, items may be assigned a residual value. A 
</p>
<p>residual value is a value to which the item falls and it then continues at that 
</p>
<p>value from then on, until disposal. Figure 23.3 Residual Value illustrates this. 
</p>
<p>The residual value may reflect an assessed value to the organization of an item

</p>
<p>that continues to be functionally useful, or a scrap or trade-in value. In prac-
</p>
<p>tice, any potential residual value is often lost in the cost of disposal and the true 
</p>
<p>residual value of an item may be very small or even negative. However, if an 
</p>
<p>item is to be retained on the books, it is advisable to assign it some value so that 
</p>
<p>it retains its identity and accountability. Take advice from your accountants in 
</p>
<p>regard to residual value.
</p>
<p>23.3.5.1  Depreciable Amount
</p>
<p>In cases where there is a residual value, the depreciable amount is the difference 
</p>
<p>between the Acquisition Cost and the Residual Value.
</p>
<p>23.3.6  Declining Balance Depreciation
</p>
<p>In the declining balance method of depreciation the book value decreases by a 
</p>
<p>constant proportion of its current value each year.
</p>
<p>For example, at a depreciation rate of 25 %, the value will decline to 75 % of 
</p>
<p>the original value in the first year and then by 25 % of that, to 56.25 % of the orig-
</p>
<p>inal in the second year, and so on. Figure 23.4 illustrates depreciation by declining 
</p>
<p>balance.

<p>23.4  Profit and Loss Account
</p>
<p>The profit or loss made by a company is calculated in an account called the Profit 
</p>
<p>and Loss Account. Factors in determining the amount of profit made by a com-
</p>
<p>pany are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Revenue
</p>
<p>&bull; Operating expenses
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance expenses
</p>
<p>&bull; Interest expenses
</p>
<p>&bull; Depreciation
</p>
<p>&bull; Tax.
</p>
<p>The amount of profit is calculated by first calculating the taxable income, given 
</p>
<p>by the sales revenue minus the various expenses and depreciation. The operating 
</p>
<p>expenses referred to are typically made up of items, such as wages, fuel, mate-
</p>
<p>rials, spare parts, leasing charges, and rents. Depreciation is the decline in the 
</p>
<p>value of fixed assets in the year, calculated in accordance with accounting rules. 
</p>
<p>Company tax is then calculated as a percentage of the taxable income. Subtracting 
</p>
<p>the company tax from the pre-tax profit gives the after-tax profit for the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion. The results are shown in the Profit and Loss account, illustrated schemati-
</p>
<p>cally in Fig. 23.5. Company tax is levied on taxable income, typically at a rate of 
</p>
<p>about 30 %.
</p>

</p>
<p>Payments by an organization need to be funded, and cash requirements must be 
</p>
<p>considered. If adequate cash is not on hand, money must be borrowed, and this 
</p>
<p>will incur interest expense. Figure 23.6 illustrates a cash flow statement. Cash flow 
</p>
<p>considerations influence financial thinking in regard to both capital and operating 
</p>
<p>budgets.

<p>Note that the cash outgoing for capital purchases occurs in the Cash Flow 
</p>
<p>Statement (Fig. 23.6) but not in the Profit and Loss Account (Fig. 23.5).
</p>
<p>23.6.1  Depreciation Tax Credit
</p>
<p>A tax credit is an amount of money that a taxpayer is able to subtract from the 
</p>
<p>amount of tax that they owe to the government. A depreciation tax credit is a credit 
</p>
<p>arising from the tax deductibility of the depreciation of an asset.
</p>
<p>The purchase of a fixed asset involves payment of the acquisition cost, A, at the 
</p>
<p>time of acquisition&mdash;year zero. There is then a reduction in tax liability in subse-
</p>
<p>quent years over the life of the item, as the depreciation is deducted from the pre-
</p>
<p>tax profit. The reduction in the tax paid, is &ldquo;annual depreciation &times; company tax 
</p>
<p>rate,&rdquo; D*c, in terms of Eq. 23.4. This amount is known as a depreciation tax credit. 
</p>
<p>The depreciation tax credit means that there is a reduced cash outflow in the form 
</p>
<p>of tax paid.
</p>
<p>The effective cash flow related to the capital cost of the fixed asset is therefore 
</p>
<p>as shown in Fig. 23.7, for an item with a 4-year effective life, straight line depre-
</p>
<p>ciation D per year and company tax rate, c.
</p>
<p>Note that the sum of the depreciation terms will be A, the acquisition cost, so 
</p>
<p>that the whole of this cost is ultimately tax deductible, but the deductability is 
</p>
<p>spread over the life of the asset.

<p>23.6.2  Maintenance Tax Credits
</p>
<p>A maintenance tax credit is a cash flow arising from the tax deductibility of 
</p>
<p>maintenance.
</p>
<p>Company expenses are denoted by E in Eq. 23.4. The after-tax cash flow due 
</p>
<p>to expenses but allowing for tax deductibility is E * (1 &ndash; c). Maintenance is part 
</p>
<p>of the expenses, so for a maintenance cost M we have an after-tax cash flow in the 
</p>
<p>year of &ndash;M * (1 &ndash; c).
</p>
<p>23.6.3  Tax Credit Summary
</p>
<p>We see that the effect of company tax on earnings is equivalent to bringing in the 
</p>
<p>following three adjustments:
</p>
<p>a. reducing the revenue, R, by an amount R*c,
</p>
<p>b. reducing the annual expenses by E*c,
</p>
<p>c. adding income of amount D*c.
</p>
<p>The term R*c will normally be bigger than the operating plus depreciation tax 
</p>
<p>credits, so although the cost part of the cash flow is reduced, the revenue part will 
</p>
<p>be reduced even more, with net cost being exactly equivalent to the amount of tax 
</p>
<p>to be paid.
</p>
<p>23.6.4  Tax on Resale
</p>
<p>On resale of an asset, tax is payable on the difference between the resale price 
</p>
<p>realized, S, and the written down value, W.
</p>
<p>If W &gt; S this becomes a tax credit, otherwise it means that additional tax is 
</p>
<p>payable.
</p>
<p>(23.5)Tax on resale = (S &minus; W) &lowast; company tax rate.

<p>The tax-credit adjusted maintenance expenditure in year of life i is:

</p>
<p>23.8  Conclusion
</p>
<p>When assessing project alternatives, we should look for the alternative which 
</p>
<p>maximizes after-tax profits. However, in many asset management applications, 
</p>
<p>the revenue and the operating expenses are dependent on business factors which 
</p>
<p>lie outside the scope of asset management decision making. It is also difficult to 
</p>
<p>accurately assign profit contributions to particular assets. We may therefore focus 
</p>
<p>on minimizing costs initially, taking account of &ldquo;tax credits.&rdquo; Subsequently, we 
</p>
<p>may need to assess the effect of different options on the revenue and operating 
</p>
<p>costs.
</p>
<p>The effect of tax on asset decisions arises from the fact that expenses are tax 
</p>
<p>deductible in the current year, whereas capital expenditure is only tax deductible 
</p>
<p>on a deferred basis, in the form of depreciation. This tends to favor repair over 
</p>
<p>replacement and leasing over purchase, but the extent of this depends on the rela-
</p>
<p>tive underlying costs. In particular, since repairs to equipment are tax deductible 
</p>
<p>in the current year, this may make it attractive to postpone a replacement, but we 
</p>
<p>need to be sure that the repairs will deliver adequate reliability and availability 
</p>
<p>over the remaining life of the equipment, so that the savings are not more than off-
</p>
<p>set by losses in performance.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to present some examples of cases where 
</p>
<p>asset decisions are required and to illustrate the financial and operational 
</p>
<p> considerations involved. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will be aware 
</p>
<p>of the application of discounted cash flow to repair or replace decisions and 
</p>
<p> equipment acquisition decisions and  the importance of taking operational factors 
</p>
<p>into account in the overall decision-making process.
</p>
<p>24.1  Repair/Replace Decision for Ore Loading Vehicles
</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the use of discounted cash flow analysis to assist 
</p>
<p>in analyzing a decision on whether to repair or replace an ore loading vehicle in 
</p>
<p>an underground mine. As well as illustrating the use of discounted cash flow, the 
</p>
<p>example illustrates the importance of using management judgment in regard to the 
</p>
<p>operational factors involved in the analysis. In fact, the financial analysis is the 
</p>
<p>simple part for any given set of facts. The hard part is deciding what factors should 
</p>
<p>be taken into account and estimating the costs, revenues, and risks involved.
</p>
<p>24.1.1  Situation
</p>
<p>A mining company owns several vehicles of a type known as Load-Haul-Dump 
</p>
<p>Trucks, usually referred to as &ldquo;loaders&rdquo;. The loaders are used underground to 
</p>
<p>move rock containing copper, lead, and silver ores, which has been broken up by 
</p>
<p>blasting. The environment is hot, rough, and abrasive and the maintenance costs 
</p>
<p>are high. Figure 24.1 shows one of the loaders at work.

</p>
<p>24.1.2  Required Decision
</p>
<p>We have an existing 4-year-old loader and we need to decide whether to trade it in 
</p>
<p>for a new one or to overhaul it and continue to use it for another 4 years. Thus, we 
</p>
<p>are looking at two options:
</p>
<p>&bull; Replace Option&mdash;we replace the old loader, trading it in for a new one.
</p>
<p>&bull; Overhaul Option&mdash;we overhaul the old loader and keep it for four more years.
</p>
<p>24.1.3  Factors Involved in the Replace or Overhaul Decision
</p>
<p>Initially, we make a list of those factors that are relevant to our decision. 
</p>
<p>Subsequently, we shall see how the story unfolds through several stages of analy-
</p>
<p>sis. The factors that we come up with are as follows:
</p>
<p>a. Cost of a new loader.
</p>
<p>b. Trade-in value of old loader.
</p>
<p>c. Overhaul cost of old loader (local rebuild).
</p>
<p>d. Maintenance costs of old loader over remaining life and new loader through life.
</p>
<p>e. Discounted cash flow of costs in each case, taking into account company tax.
</p>
<p>f. Reliability/availability of old versus new loader.

<p>24.2  Replace Option
</p>
<p>24.2.1  New Ore Loader Costs
</p>
<p>As a first step in our analysis we calculate the net present value of the life cycle 
</p>
<p>costs of acquiring a new loader and maintaining it for 4 years. For this purpose we 
</p>
<p>need data on the costs relating to the acquisition of a new loader, the maintenance 
</p>
<p>costs, and the disposal cost. The data shown in Fig. 24.2 have been estimated for 
</p>
<p>the acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of a new loader over 4 years. The exist-
</p>
<p>ing 4-year-old loader can be traded-in for $150,000.
</p>
<p>A cash flow diagram for these costs is shown in Fig. 24.3. These data are the 
</p>
<p>same as that used in Chap. 5 to illustrate the calculation of the life cycle Net Present 
</p>
<p>Value and Equivalent Annual Cost using the Excel functions NPV and PMT.

</p>
<p>24.3  New Loader Life Cycle NPV and EAC
</p>
<p>The Net Present Value and the Equivalent Annual Cost of the life cycle costs of 
</p>
<p>the loader can be calculated using the Excel NPV and PMT functions. The spread-
</p>
<p>sheet is shown at Fig. 24.4. The background to this is outlined in Chap. 5. The 
</p>
<p>NPV for the life cycle cost of $886,295 with the interest rate specified as 9 %, 
</p>
<p>and the Equivalent Annual Cost is $273,571 per year. Note that, although the 
</p>
<p>spreadsheet gives the answer to an impressive degree of precision, the accuracy 
</p>
<p>of the result depends on the accuracy of the various cost estimates, and we should 
</p>
<p> therefore allow for a significant degree of variability in practice.
</p>
<p>24.4  Overhaul Option
</p>
<p>24.4.1  Old Ore Loader Costs
</p>
<p>The next step toward our replace or overhaul decision is to estimate the costs of 
</p>
<p>overhauling and maintaining the old loader over the 4-year period. These costs 
</p>
<p>are shown in Table 24.1, where the costs are taken as occurring at the end of the 
</p>
<p>years shown. The initial overhaul cost is $240,000. The maintenance cost in year 
</p>
<p>1 is $90,000. In year 2 the maintenance cost is $135,000 and a second overhaul is 
</p>
<p>required at the end of year 2/beginning of year 3 at a cost of $240,000. The resale 
</p>
<p>value of the loader at the end of year 4 is $0.

</p>
<p>The Excel calculation of the Net Present Value and Equivalent Annual Cost are 
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 24.6. Use is made of the Excel NPV and PMT functions. We see 
</p>
<p>that the Net Present Value of costs for the old loader option is $825,542, and the 
</p>
<p>Equivalent Annual Cost is $254,819 per year.
</p>
<p>24.5  Cost Summary
</p>
<p>The Equivalent Annual Cost for the old loader option and the corresponding result 
</p>
<p>for the new loader option are summarized in Table 24.2.
</p>
<p>Table 24.2 indicates that the old loader overhaul option is $18,752 per year cheaper 
</p>
<p>than the new loader, or replace, option. In the application on which this example is 
</p>
<p>based, a decision was made initially to overhaul the old loader, but later, when the 
</p>
<p>full implications of the choice were realized, it became clear that this decision was 
</p>
<p>incorrect. The reasons for this will become apparent as we analyze the problem further.

</p>
<p>24.6  Ore Loader Cost Analysis with Tax
</p>
<p>The decision of whether to buy a new loader or  to overhaul the old one was 
</p>
<p>also influenced by the question of tax. If the work that we have referred to as 
</p>
<p>an &ldquo; overhaul&rdquo; was classified as operating expense it would be immediately tax 
</p>
<p>deductible. This would improve the cash flow of the overhaul option, compared 
</p>
<p>to the replace option. Since the overhaul option has already been found to be 
</p>
<p>cheaper before tax, this would further increase the advantage of the overhaul 
</p>
<p>option after tax.
</p>
<p>This question of OPEX or CAPEX expenditure can be something of a gray 
</p>
<p>area. Repairs or overhauls carried out as part of the normal life cycle of an equip-
</p>
<p>ment are generally regarded as operating costs. But a major overhaul aimed at 
</p>
<p>rejuvenating an equipment and hence, increasing its capital value beyond that 
</p>
<p>which is normal for an item of the given age, is regarded as a capital expense. 
</p>
<p>The book value should be revised upwards and the depreciation regime should be 
</p>
<p>adjusted.
</p>
<p>We now consider how the after tax costs will work out if the overhaul is 
</p>
<p>regarded as a maintenance cost, which is tax deductible in the current year.
</p>
<p>24.6.1  &ldquo;Replace&rdquo; Option with Tax
</p>
<p>We illustrate the application of tax credits by continuing the replace or overhaul 
</p>
<p>analysis relating to the ore loader. The adjusted cash flows are based on tax credits 
</p>
<p>in the manner indicated in Fig. 23.9. The cost analysis for the Replace Option is 
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 24.7.
</p>
<p>The effective life of the loader has been given as 5 years for depreciation pur-
</p>
<p>poses. Straight line depreciation is used. The annual depreciation is shown in 
</p>
<p>row 6 of the spreadsheet. The depreciation tax credits are shown in row 7 and the 
</p>
<p>maintenance tax credits in row 9. To determine the tax on resale, the book value, 
</p>
<p>or Written Down Value (WDV) is calculated and is shown at B10 for the original 
</p>
<p>old vehicle and at F10 for the acquired vehicle. The tax on resale is shown at B11 
</p>
<p>and F11.
</p>
<p>The costs year by year are then calculated as shown in row 12 and the Net 
</p>
<p>Present Value of the costs, and the Equivalent Annual Cost are shown at B13 and 
</p>

<p>24.6.2  &ldquo;Overhaul&rdquo; Option with Tax
</p>
<p>For the option of overhauling the old loader the cost analysis with tax credits is 
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 24.8.
</p>
<p>The maintenance tax credits appear in row 4. There is 1 year of depreciation 
</p>
<p>remaining as the loader is 4-years old at the start and this is shown in cell C6. 
</p>
<p>The net present value of costs over the 4-year period is $534,944, cell B8, and the 
</p>
<p>equivalent annual cost is $165,120, cell B9. The value of the saving, as an equiva-
</p>
<p>lent annual cost, is given by the difference between the EACs shown in cell B14 of 
</p>
<p>Fig. 24.7 and cell B9 of Fig. 24.8. The saving is shown at cell B10 of Fig. 24.8 and 
</p>
<p>is $27,129 per year. This result is also summarized in Fig. 24.9.
</p>
<p>24.6.3  Loader Initial Policy Decision
</p>
<p>The initial decision taken by the mining company in the replace versus overhaul 
</p>
<p>issue was to overhaul the old loader. This was based on the cost comparisons indi-
</p>
<p>cated in Fig. 24.8.

<p>24.7  Availability and Reliability
</p>
<p>Although the costings indicated in favor of overhauling the old loader, the assump-
</p>
<p>tions on which this was based turned out to be overoptimistic.
</p>
<p>After experiencing one overhaul, the policy was changed for future loaders, and 
</p>
<p>the loaders were subsequently replaced at age 4 years. The main reason for the 
</p>
<p>change was the loss of availability while the old loaders were being overhauled. 
</p>
<p>Initially it was assumed that the overhaul could be completed during the 2-week 
</p>
<p>annual shutdown, but in fact further delays occurred resulting in an extra week of 
</p>
<p>production losses which could not be made up. Also, the overhauled vehicles had 
</p>
<p>no warranty cover, they were less reliable than new ones, and did not offer various 
</p>
<p>design improvements that the manufacturer had built into later models. These fac-
</p>
<p>tors more than offset the savings from overhauling the old vehicles. The saving in 
</p>
<p>Fig. 24.8 of $27,129 per year is less than the sales value of the metal moved in one 
</p>
<p>working day by a loader.

<p>24.7.1  Replace/Overhaul Ore Loader Conclusion
</p>
<p>The conclusion of the Overhaul/Replace decision analysis for the loaders was that 
</p>
<p>the loaders should be replaced rather than overhauled. The initial cost analysis did 
</p>
<p>not make  sufficient allowance for the time required to complete the overhaul or 
</p>
<p>for the poorer reliability, availability, and reduced performance of the overhauled 
</p>
<p>loaders when compared with the latest models. This highlighted the need to com-
</p>
<p>bine financial analysis with an overall view of the operational requirements.

<p>24.8  Exercises
</p>
<p>24.8.1  Standby Generator Exercise
</p>
<p>A company is to install a standby generator in a certain location, at which it is 
</p>
<p>required for 5 years. The initial capital cost is $75,000 and the annual routine 
</p>
<p>maintenance cost is $2,500. The annual unscheduled maintenance cost has been 
</p>
<p>estimated at an average value of $3,500 per year. The value of the generator at the 
</p>
<p>end of 5 years is estimated at $40,000.
</p>
<p>The company wishes to ascertain an equivalent annual cost as a basis for charg-
</p>
<p>ing out the generator. Running expenses are additional and are not included at this 
</p>
<p>point. The cost of capital advised by the finance department for this application is 
</p>
<p>9 %.
</p>
<p>Calculate:
</p>
<p>(a) the equivalent annual cost of providing the generator,
</p>
<p>(b) the NPV of this cost.
</p>
<p>(c) If the company rents the generator out at $30,000 per year, how much profit 
</p>
<p>will it make in total?
</p>
<p>Answers: (a) $18,598 per year. (b) $72,341. (c) $44,350 (npv).

</p>
<p>shows the spreadsheet. Notes on the additional Excel features used in this exercise 
</p>
<p>are given at the end of the solution.
</p>
<p>For question (a) we need to calculate equivalent annual cost for the various cost 
</p>
<p>components.
</p>
<p>1. Convert the initial capital cost of $75,000 into an EAC over the 5-year period 
</p>
<p>by using the PMT function. The result is shown at cell C4 and is $19,282 per 
</p>
<p>year.
</p>
<p>2. Convert the terminal value into an EAC by using the PMT function with the 
</p>
<p>option of the cost being at the end of the time period. The result is shown at 
</p>
<p>cell C5 and is &minus;$6,683 per year. (Note: this use of the PMT function is illus-
</p>
<p>trated separately at the end of this exercise.)
</p>
<p>3. The maintenance costs are already annual costs, and their total is:
</p>
<p>$2,500 + $3,500 = $6,000 per year.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>451
</p>
<p>Add the amounts from steps 1, 2, and 3 to get the total cost (the terminal value 
</p>
<p>is negative):
</p>
<p>This result of $18,599 per year is shown at cell C8.
</p>
<p>For question (b) we need to convert the EAC of $18,599 per year into an NPV. 
</p>
<p>This can be done using the Excel function PV, with the result shown at cell D8, 
</p>
<p>that is, $72,341.
</p>
<p>For question (c), if rent is $30,000 p.a. the net revenue is 30,000 &minus; 18,599 =  
</p>
<p>$11,401 p.a.
</p>
<p>The total NPV of net revenue is calculated using the PV fuction at cell D11 and 
</p>
<p>is $44,346.
</p>
<p>24.9.1.1  The Excel Function PV
</p>
<p>The Excel function PV calculates the net present value of a uniform series of 
</p>
<p>annual payments. Figure 24.11 shows an example of the use of the Excel PV func-
</p>
<p>tion. In a certain application there is an annual scheduled maintenance cost of 
</p>
<p>$2,500 incurred each year for 5 years. We wish to calculate the net present value 
</p>
<p>of this maintenance cost at an interest rate of 9 %. The annual cost is at B6, the 
</p>
<p>Initial capital EAC = 19,282 $ per year
</p>
<p>Terminalvalue EAC = &minus;6,683 $ per year
</p>
<p>Maintenance EAC = 6,000 $ per year
</p>
<p>Total EAC = 18,599 $ per year

</p>
<p>number of years at B4, and the interest rate at D4. The function PV is used in cell 
</p>
<p>B7 to calculate the net present value of these maintenance costs. The function field 
</p>
<p>shows the use of the Excel function PV. The minus sign in front of the function 
</p>
<p>gives the PV the same sign as the maintenance cost.
</p>
<p>24.9.1.2  Payment or Cost at End
</p>
<p>The PMT function has an option for calculating the equivalent annual cost of a 
</p>
<p>payment made at the end of the last period, rather than at the beginning of the 
</p>
<p>first period. This is useful if we require the EAC of a terminal or resale value. 
</p>
<p>An example in which a resale value of $40,000 received in 5 years time is con-
</p>
<p>verted to an equivalent annual cost at 9 % is shown in Fig. 24.12 at cell C5 and  in 
</p>
<p>Fig. 24.12 at cell C7.
</p>
<p>24.9.2  Solar or Diesel Power Exercise Solution
</p>
<p>This exercise illustrates the use of the Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) in compar-
</p>
<p>ing costs for items with different life cycle durations. For example, the solar cells 
</p>
<p>have a life of 15 years but the batteries have a life of 7 years. Expressing both 
</p>
<p>costs as EACs provides a basis for comparisons.
</p>
<p>In this solution, the discount factors and annuity factors have been used 
</p>
<p>directly, rather than through Excel, so as to show the principles involved.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to present the concept of economic life and to 
</p>
<p>discuss the role it plays in asset management decisions relating to life cycle costing  
</p>
<p>and replacement decisions. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will know 
</p>
<p>what is meant by economic life and how it can be estimated from cost data.
</p>
<p>25.1  Economic Life Concept
</p>
<p>The economic life of an item is the age beyond which it is not worth keeping it 
</p>
<p>from a cost point of view. It is the life duration which minimizes its cost per unit 
</p>
<p>time, or, allowing for discounted cash flow, the equivalent annual cost.
</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, &ldquo;economic life&rdquo; is a somewhat idealized con-
</p>
<p>cept, as many factors can influence the actual decision to replace an item. These 
</p>
<p>factors are considered in detail in the chapter on equipment replacement. However, 
</p>
<p>it is worthwhile to consider the concept of economic life as it forms a basis that 
</p>
<p>underlies replacement analysis.
</p>
<p>Tax authorities assign &ldquo;effective lives&rdquo; to items. These lives are based on a 
</p>
<p> perceived average age to which we would normally expect an item to last&mdash;which 
</p>
<p>is, in effect, an average economic life. In life cycle costing, the length of life of 
</p>
<p>an item may be based on technical judgment, or on more formal cost analysis. In 
</p>
<p>principle, the life chosen should be the economic life.
</p>
<p>25.2  Economic Life Example
</p>
<p>The following example contains only the simplest costs, so that we can concentrate 
</p>
<p>on the cost structure. Issues such as resale, discounting, and tax are disregarded in 
</p>
<p>this example, but are considered later.

<p>456 25 Economic Life
</p>
<p>A certain type of vehicle is purchased for an acquisition cost of $300,000. 
</p>
<p>The operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs in years 1, 2, 3, 4 of the life of the 
</p>
<p> vehicle, are as shown in Table 25.1. Calculate the economic life.
</p>
<p>25.2.1  Hand Calculation
</p>
<p>To determine the economic life we calculate the cost per year for each of the 
</p>
<p>options of 1, 2, 3, or 4-year life cycles. The economic life will be the cycle length 
</p>
<p>which gives the lowest cost per year.
</p>
<p>For replacement at age Y, the total cost, C, is given by:
</p>
<p>C = Acquisition cost + Cumulative O&amp;M cost
</p>
<p>And the cost per year is C/Y.
</p>
<p>For example, if the policy is to replace the vehicle at age 1 year. The total cost 
</p>
<p>over the life of the vehicle, C1, is given by:
</p>
<p>The cost per year for this policy is therefore $310,000.
</p>
<p>If the policy is to replace the vehicle at age 2 years, the total cost over the life 
</p>
<p>of the vehicle, C2, is given by:
</p>
<p>The $335,000 is the cost incurred over a 2-year period and to get the average cost 
</p>
<p>per year we must divide by 2.
</p>
<p>Thus the cost per year is 335,000/2 = 167,500.
</p>
<p>Similarly, for replacement at age 3 we have:
</p>
<p>$/yr = (300,000 + 10,000 + 25,000 + 45,000)/3 = 126,667
</p>
<p>and for replacement at age 4 we have:
</p>
<p>These results are summarized in Table 25.2. We see that the lowest cost per year 
</p>
<p>occurs when the replacement age is 3 years, so this is the economic life.
</p>
<p>C1 = Acquisition cost + O&amp;M costs year 1
</p>
<p>= 300,000 + 10,000 = 310,000
</p>
<p>C2 = Acquisition cost + O&amp;M costs year 1 + O&amp; M costs year 2
</p>
<p>= 300,000 + 10,000 + 25,000 = 335,000
</p>
<p>$/yr = (300,000 + 10,000 + 25,000 + 45,000 + 150,000)/4

<p>25.2.2  Spreadsheet Calculation
</p>
<p>Table 25.3 shows these calculations in a spreadsheet. The acquisition cost is at cell 
</p>
<p>B2. The O&amp;M costs are in row 3. The cumulative O&amp;M costs are in Row 4. The 
</p>
<p>total cumulative costs including the acquisition cost are in Row 5. Row 6, columns 
</p>
<p>C to F, show the costs per year for the 1, 2, 3, and 4-year cycles, respectively. The 
</p>
<p>results are the same as in Table 25.2 and confirm that the economic life is 3 years. 
</p>
<p>The cost per year of $126,667 is shown at cell E6.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.1 shows the cost per year (from Row 6 of Table 25.3) as a graph. We see 
</p>
<p>graphically that the economic life occurs when the cost per year is a minimum at age 3.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.2 shows the total cumulative cost (from Row 5 of Table 25.3) as a 
</p>
<p>graph. The radius vector has been drawn in, showing that the economic life occurs 
</p>
<p>when the marginal increase in cumulative cost exceeds the average life cycle cost 
</p>
<p>per year. As expected, the economic life occurs at age 3.

<p>458 25 Economic Life
</p>
<p>Figure 25.2 illustrates the point that the economic life occurs when the mar-
</p>
<p>ginal cost of keeping the item exceeds the average cost to date.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.3 shows the annual O&amp;M cost (Row 3 of Table 25.3) plotted against 
</p>
<p>age. The dotted line is the life cycle average cost per year at the economic life. We 
</p>
<p>see that in year 4 the annual maintenance cost exceeds the life cycle average cost 
</p>
<p>per year at the economic life. This is another way of presenting the same result, 
</p>
<p>namely that when the annual maintenance cost exceeds the life cycle average cost 
</p>
<p>per year, then the economic life has been passed.
</p>
<p>In replacement problems, the marginal cost refers to an existing item and the 
</p>
<p>average cost per year is an estimate for the annualized life cycle cost of a potential

<p>When costs are discounted and we have life cycles of different lengths we base our

</p>
<p>Figure 25.5 shows schematically the cash flow diagrams as they apply for a 3-year 
</p>
<p>and a for a 4-year life cycle. From these cash flows we calculate the Equivalent

<p>Annual Costs for each cycle, using the appropriate interest rate, and then compare 
</p>
<p>the EACs. The cycle length with the lowest EAC indicates the economic life.
</p>
<p>For the data of Fig. 25.4, 25.6 shows the calculation of the equivalent annual

<p>costs of the four life cycle options, with the interest rate at 15 %. The Excel 
</p>
<p>functions NPV and PMT are used in the spreadsheet. By inspection, we see

<p>that the minimum cost replacement age is 3 years, the EAC being $130,364 per

<p>460 25 Economic Life
</p>
<p>The economic life may vary with the value of the interest rate. As a general 
</p>
<p>principle, raising the interest rate has the effect of making it optimal to  postpone 
</p>
<p>replacement. This is an example of how raising the interest rate dampens 
</p>
<p> economic activity. However, solutions to problems of this type are not always 
</p>
<p>sensitive to moderate changes in the interest rate, or, indeed to other data items. 
</p>
<p>One of the potential applications of this type of model is to test the sensitivity of 
</p>
<p>the solution to changes in the data.
</p>
<p>25.2.4  Economic Life with Discounting and Tax
</p>
<p>Tax can be allowed for using the tax credit analysis described in Sect. 23.6. 
</p>
<p>Figure 25.7 shows this in spreadsheet form. Depreciation is based on the declin-
</p>
<p>ing balance method at a rate of 18.75 % per year and the company tax is at 30 %. 
</p>
<p>The optimal life cycle remains at 3 years, so that in this case company tax has not 
</p>
<p>affected the practical decision (Fig. 25.7).

<p>25.3.2  Self-Assessment Exercise Solution
</p>
<p>1. What is meant by the economic life of an item?
</p>
<p>The economic life of an item is the age beyond which it is not worth keeping an 
</p>
<p>item from a cost point of view. It is the life duration which minimizes its cost 
</p>
<p>per unit time, or, allowing for discounted cash flow, the equivalent annual cost.
</p>
<p>2. What is the relationship between the economic life and the marginal cost  
</p>
<p>of maintenance?
</p>
<p>The economic life occurs when the marginal annual cost rate for maintenance 
</p>
<p>equals the average annual cost rate over the life cycle.

<p>3. How is the economic life calculated:
</p>
<p>a. Undiscounted case
</p>
<p>For life cycles of a relevant range of lengths, in the undiscounted case 
</p>
<p>we calculate the total cost of acquisition, operation, and maintenance and 
</p>
<p>divide by the length of the life cycle to obtain a cost per unit time. The life 
</p>
<p>cycle with the lowest cost per unit time determines the economic life.
</p>
<p>b. Discounted case
</p>
<p>For life cycles of a relevant range of lengths, in the discounted case we 
</p>
<p> calculate the total net present value of the cost of acquisition, operation, 
</p>
<p>and maintenance and then calculate the equivalent annual cost for the life 
</p>
<p>cycle. The life cycle with the lowest equivalent annual cost determines the

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to present the factors involved in  decisions 
</p>
<p>relating to the replacement of equipment, and to show how replacement deci-
</p>
<p>sions can be analyzed. Various scenarios relating to replacement analysis based 
</p>
<p>on increasing maintenance cost with age presented. The use of spend-limits as 
</p>
<p>a replacement control mechanism is presented and  the role of risk analysis  
</p>
<p>in replacement decisions. Factors involved in the replacement of linear assets 
</p>
<p>such as pipelines, power lines, roads, and rail lines are discussed and  component 
</p>
<p>replacement policies. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will be aware of 
</p>
<p>the factors which influence equipment replacement decisions. You will know 
</p>
<p>that financial analysis of replacement policy is based on comparing the estimated 
</p>
<p>future costs of the existing equipment with that of a challenger. You will know 
</p>
<p>about spend-limits and their role in the setting of replacement policies and how 
</p>
<p>risk might be taken into account. You will also be aware of factors involved in 
</p>
<p>component replacement decisions.
</p>
<p>26.1  Replacement Planning
</p>
<p>H.M. Barker in his book &ldquo;Camels and the Outback&rdquo; reports that in 1923 he was 
</p>
<p>carting material from Nullagine to Marble bar in Western Australia when his 
</p>
<p>camel wagon, for which the 90 km journey took 3 days, was overtaken by a motor 
</p>
<p>lorry&mdash;the first one in the region. He thought that the lorry was a novelty that 
</p>
<p>would never seriously compete with his camels, but by the time he got to Marble 
</p>
<p>Bar the lorry had passed him three more times, and the mine manager had sent 
</p>
<p>word that his wagon would not be required any more.
</p>
<p>Organizations need a systematic approach to the development of  replacement 
</p>
<p>plans. Flexibility must be retained as priorities may change, but a backlog of 
</p>
<p>replacements should not build up to a point where losses or serious risks are 
</p>
<p>occurring. The magnitude of such losses or risks is often a more important factor 
</p>
<p>than the achievement of precise cost optimality in replacement planning.

<p>464 26 Equipment Replacement Decisions
</p>
<p>Those who wish to win friends and influence people never bring bad news, as 
</p>
<p>the reaction of senior people is often to shoot the messenger. Replacing existing 
</p>
<p>equipment is rarely the glamour side of business management and this creates a 
</p>
<p>dilemma for asset managers whose job involves replacement planning.
</p>
<p>The best approach is to have a rolling plan in which all forward replacement 
</p>
<p>requirements are indicated well in advance, the costs are built into the capital 
</p>
<p>budget, and the acquisition lead times are allowed for. The asset manager can then 
</p>
<p>become an occasional bringer of good news if some items turn out to be in better 
</p>
<p>condition than originally anticipated as their forecast replacement date approaches. 
</p>
<p>Risk assessments should be included, so as to provide senior management with 
</p>
<p>information on relative priorities. However, it is important to avoid crying wolf or 
</p>
<p>being too smart after event. Putting forward reasoned proposals with an associated 
</p>
<p>risk assessment will produce the best results.
</p>
<p>Lack of sufficient focus on equipment condition within an organization can 
</p>
<p>lead to a procrastination driven tragedy. The asset manager requests finance for 
</p>
<p>equipment replacement but is asked to prove that it is essential. This is hard 
</p>
<p>to substantiate, the money is not forthcoming, and eventually a significant fail-
</p>
<p>ure occurs. The asset manager is then criticized for &ldquo;not warning&rdquo; senior man-
</p>
<p>agement about the problem. A more extreme version is the asset death spiral 
</p>
<p>mentioned in an early chapter. In that scenario, maintenance and replacement 
</p>
<p>budgets and technical infrastructure are reduced creating short-term savings. 
</p>
<p>Routine maintenance becomes minimal or nonexistent. Eventually a catastrophe 
</p>
<p>occurs.
</p>
<p>26.2  Reasons for Equipment Replacement
</p>
<p>As equipment ages there are many reasons why we eventually need to replace 
</p>
<p>it. Key factors influencing replacement decisions include the following; in many 
</p>
<p>cases more than one factor will come into play at the same time.
</p>
<p>Operational reasons
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced performance through degradation or relative to newer equipment types
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced availability
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced reliability
</p>
<p>Technical reasons
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment not repairable at all
</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment not logistically supportable, e.g., spares not available, repair  facilities 
</p>
<p>not available
</p>
<p>&bull; Increased risk of failure, long term deterioration e.g., corrosion, fatigue, insulation 
</p>
<p>deterioration, with associated risk-costs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>465
</p>
<p>Commercial reasons
</p>
<p>&bull; Operationally obsolete
</p>
<p>&bull; Capacity needs have changed, increased or decreased
</p>
<p>&bull; Operating value low compared with new
</p>
<p>&bull; Operating costs high compared with new
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance costs high compared with new
</p>
<p>&bull; Item requires repair, the cost of which is unlikely to be recovered.
</p>
<p>Regulatory reasons
</p>
<p>&bull; Safety or health issues
</p>
<p>&bull; Environmental issues
</p>
<p>&bull; Government regulator&rsquo;s rules favor replacement because they are based on book 
</p>
<p>value which is now low or zero
</p>
<p>&bull; Technical regulations changed, e.g., increased fuel efficiency mandated.
</p>
<p>Figure 26.1 shows a flowchart covering the logic of replacement decisions. The 
</p>
<p>box at the top left summarizes physical or operational reasons for  equipment 
</p>
<p>replacement. Financial issues may include economic life, the spend-limit 
</p>
<p> considered in a later section, and risk-cost, that is the probability of incurring an 
</p>
<p> excessive cost as a result of a risk eventuating. In some cases it may be possible 
</p>
<p>to redeploy or refurbish equipment and these possibilities are covered in the flow-
</p>
<p>chart. The flowchart was developed for items with a focus on service provision and 
</p>
<p>cost minimization, rather than on profit generation. In a profit focused case, net 
</p>
<p>operating value would be an issue, rather than cost alone.

<p>466 26 Equipment Replacement Decisions
</p>
<p>26.3  Technical Assessment
</p>
<p>An awareness of criticality and the identification of high risk items is important in the 
</p>
<p>overview of technical condition and replacement analysis. The condition of the exist-
</p>
<p>ing equipment, particularly in regard to things that deteriorate with age and are not 
</p>
<p>readily remedied, should be monitored. Condition monitoring techniques should be 
</p>
<p>deployed to obtain indications of equipment state, and this can give an advance indi-
</p>
<p>cation of when replacement will be required. Factors to be considered include corro-
</p>
<p>sion, insulation deterioration, embrittlement of plastics, moisture penetration, fatigue, 
</p>
<p>erosion, wood rot, surface degradation, cracking, and movement of structures.
</p>
<p>The performance of existing equipment should be monitored in regard to 
</p>
<p>operational efficiency, reliability, availability, and maintainability, and the results 
</p>
<p>assessed in relation to the needs of the organization. In some cases, older equip-
</p>
<p>ment can be deployed to less critical tasks or to standby roles rather than being 
</p>
<p>discarded. Degradation in performance or in regard to risk of failure often forms 
</p>
<p>the basis for equipment replacement.
</p>
<p>26.4  Data Analysis
</p>
<p>Replacement decisions are generally based on assessment of changes in 
</p>
<p> performance, reliability, and risk as equipment ages. Data relating to these factors 
</p>
<p>are often present in the form of operating and maintenance records, but in order to 
</p>
<p>use this data, suitable reports need to be generated from it. These should highlight 
</p>
<p>changes in operating performance, failure rate, and maintenance costs, forming the 
</p>
<p>basis for sound decisions for replacement of equipment. Experience and gut feel 
</p>
<p>can also play a role, but data analysis is the best approach.
</p>
<p>26.5  Cost Analysis for Replacement
</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for replacement of equipment, a supporting financial analysis 
</p>
<p>will normally be required, and we now consider the types of analysis needed.
</p>
<p>26.5.1  Like-with-Like Replacement
</p>
<p>In the chapters on life cycle costing and economic life we considered life 
</p>
<p> cycle-based cost analysis, and the determination of an equivalent annual cost (EAC) 
</p>
<p>over the life cycle. In the case of like-with-like replacement, the economic life 
</p>
<p>determined from that analysis provides the guideline for our replacement decision.
</p>
<p>An important fact to recognize is the acquisition cost of a new item is always 
</p>
<p>likely to be greater than the current year cost of keeping an old item; but to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>467
</p>
<p>minimize long-run costs we need to replace an old item when its current year costs 
</p>
<p>exceed the annualized life cycle cost (EAC) of the new item, not the acquisition 
</p>
<p>cost. This principle underlies all replacement cost analysis.
</p>
<p>26.5.2  Equivalent Annual Cost of the Challenger
</p>
<p>In practice, we are likely to find that we are making decisions about replacing 
</p>
<p>equipment of an earlier type with equipment of a newer type. This may give rise to 
</p>
<p>a need to replace for broader reasons than direct equipment cost, and these reasons 
</p>
<p>have already been discussed. We now consider the case where the &ldquo;competition&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>between existing equipment and new equipment is based on cost grounds.
</p>
<p>We can refer to the existing equipment as the old equipment and to the potential 
</p>
<p>replacement as the new equipment. Another form of nomenclature is to refer to 
</p>
<p>the potential new equipment as the &ldquo;challenger&rdquo; and the existing equipment as the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;defender&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Consider a situation where we are considering buying a new car to replace an 
</p>
<p>existing one. The new car is the challenger and the old car is the defender. The price 
</p>
<p>of the challenger will be a factor in our decision, since if prices have tended lower, 
</p>
<p>we will be likely to make the changeover sooner than if they have tended higher. 
</p>
<p>In the current year, the acquisition price of the challenger will be almost sure to 
</p>
<p>exceed the maintenance cost of the defender in that year, and if we based our com-
</p>
<p>parison solely on the immediate year&rsquo;s costs we might postpone our decision for 
</p>
<p>a very long time. The correct approach is to consider the EAC of the challenger 
</p>
<p>over its lifetime and compare this with the EAC of the defender over its estimated 
</p>
<p>remaining life. This analysis requires us to make an estimate of the EAC of the 
</p>
<p>challenger, so that life cycle costing analysis is required for the new equipment. 
</p>
<p>Previous expenditure on the existing equipment is a sunk cost and not relevant to 
</p>
<p>our decision. Indirectly though, previous expenditure may be a factor influencing 
</p>
<p>the current condition of the existing equipment, which is a consideration.
</p>
<p>26.5.3  Steadily Increasing Cost Case
</p>
<p>If the cost of the old item increases steadily year by year, the decision to replace is 
</p>
<p>based on comparing the cost of keeping the old item for one more year, as against 
</p>
<p>the annualized cost of the new, or challenger, item. The annualized cost of the new 
</p>
<p>item is the EAC, as estimated by life cycle costing.
</p>
<p>The cost of the old item includes the maintenance cost, any decline in resale 
</p>
<p>value, and costs associated with declining performance relative to a new item. For 
</p>
<p>example, if the old item incurs relatively high down time we should include an 
</p>
<p>estimate of the cost involved, compared with the corresponding lifetime average 
</p>
<p>down time per year of the challenger.
</p>
<p>Figure 26.2 illustrates the steadily increasing cost case. The &ldquo;X&rdquo; symbols rep-
</p>
<p>resent the annual maintenance costs of the old item. The EAC of the new item is 
</p>
<p>26.5 Cost Analysis for Replacement</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>468 26 Equipment Replacement Decisions
</p>
<p>referred to as EACnew. The old item should be replaced at the end of the second 
</p>
<p>year from now, as in the third year ahead (and subsequently) the annual costs of 
</p>
<p>the old item will exceed EACnew.
</p>
<p>26.5.4  Savings
</p>
<p>Another way of representing the cost comparison is by means of a cumulative plot as 
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 26.3. The cumulative cost of the old item is the lower solid line. The 
</p>
<p>upper solid line has gradient equal to the EAC of the new or challenger item. In the 
</p>
<p>cumulative plot the gap between the &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;old&rdquo; lines represents the savings 
</p>
<p>accumulated by continuing to use the old item. In Fig. 26.3 the optimum replacement 
</p>
<p>age is when the difference between the new and old lines is a maximum. The extent 
</p>
<p>of the savings can be considered when assessing risk or other intangible aspects 
</p>
<p>of the replacement option. Thus, if the total savings are quite small in relation to a 
</p>
<p> possible risk, we may decide to replace before the theoretical minimum cost point.
</p>
<p>As time goes by the origin of the graph shifts to the new &ldquo;Now&rdquo; and the 
</p>
<p> potential savings from keeping the old item decrease, and ultimately disappear.

</p>
<p>26.5.5  Unevenly Changing Cost Case
</p>
<p>The cumulative plot analysis also covers the case where the cost of the old item 
</p>
<p>does not increase steadily, but can vary, for example due to deeper  maintenance 
</p>
<p>taking place on a cyclic basis. In this case, the cost in the deeper  maintenance 
</p>
<p>year may be above the EAC of the new item, but then falls in the rest of the 
</p>
<p> maintenance cycle. The point of maximum savings on the cumulative plot 
</p>
<p>gives the optimal replacement age. The same analysis applies where a one-off 
</p>
<p> significant repair is required now; or where a refurbishment that will subsequently 
</p>
<p>lead to lower costs is being considered.
</p>
<p>Figure 26.4 shows a case where an equipment requires a major repair now, and a 
</p>
<p>forecast has been made of subsequent costs following repair. No costs are expected in 
</p>
<p>year 1. In years 2, 3, and 4 costs are low initially but then gradually increase. In year 2, 
</p>
<p>the cumulative cost curve for the old item (repaired item) falls below the cumulative 
</p>
<p>cost line for the challenger (new) item yielding savings. The optimal remaining life 
</p>
<p>occurs when the saving is a maximum. As shown, this occurs at year 3.
</p>
<p>If the cumulative cost line of the repaired item does not fall below the new item 
</p>
<p>line, then it is not worthwhile to carry out the major repair. This analysis can be 
</p>
<p>used to indicate whether a proposed repair or refurbishment is financially worth-
</p>
<p>while. The magnitude of the potential savings can be used as a judgment factor in 
</p>
<p>deciding whether to undertake the repair, and  in risk analysis.
</p>
<p>26.6  Spend-Limits
</p>
<p>We can sometimes find that excessive amounts are spent on uneconomic repairs 
</p>
<p>unless rules preventing this are put in place. Such rules are known as spend-
</p>
<p>limit rules or repair-limit rules. A spend-limit is a limit on the amount which it

<p>470 26 Equipment Replacement Decisions
</p>
<p>is permitted to spend on repair or refurbishment of an existing item. The value 
</p>
<p>of a spend-limit will depend on the type of item, its age, and the replacement 
</p>
<p>options and costs. The operation of a spend-limit system depends on the availabil-
</p>
<p>ity of replacement items. As such it is typically applicable to items of intermediate 
</p>
<p>value, such as vehicles, radio sets, common user motors, or pumps, where there is 
</p>
<p>access to a replacement pool.
</p>
<p>Logically, no more should be spent on the repair of an item than the item is 
</p>
<p>worth. As a quick guide, the book value of an item acts as an upper limit on how 
</p>
<p>much to spend on repair at any point. If the book value does not accurately reflect 
</p>
<p>the value of the item to the business, the spend-limit should be the maximum sav-
</p>
<p>ings from retaining the old equipment, as shown in Figs. 26.3 or 26.4. An item that 
</p>
<p>requires a repair whose cost exceeds its spend-limit should be replaced.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;spend-limit&rdquo; concept can be illustrated by the following common appli-
</p>
<p>cation. If a vehicle incurs accident damage which exceeds its second-hand value, 
</p>
<p>then the company that insures the vehicle will normally specify that the vehicle 
</p>
<p>is written off and is not repaired. The second-hand value acts as a limit on the 
</p>
<p>amount that is worthwhile spending on the repair. This reflects a basic principle 
</p>
<p>that no more should be spent on the repair of an item than the item is worth after 
</p>
<p>repair. The value after repair is a &ldquo;spend-limit&rdquo; for an item.
</p>
<p>26.6.1  Spend-Limit Example
</p>
<p>A bus company has a number of old buses which are used only on days of high 
</p>
<p>demand. Repair/replacement decisions are controlled by spend-limits. The 
</p>
<p>spend-limit for old buses is set to a level which allows buses with no problems or 
</p>
<p>requiring very minor repairs to be retained, but repairs involving major assembly 
</p>
<p>replacement or major bodywork are ruled out.
</p>
<p>26.7  Risk with Ageing Equipment
</p>
<p>Equipment replacement decisions often need to take account of risk. Average 
</p>
<p>cost per unit time will decrease initially as the acquisition cost is amortized, as 
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 26.5. But then, rather than tending slowly upwards, there may be 
</p>
<p>a sudden jump in costs due to a major failure. This type of behavior occurs with 
</p>
<p>items whose maintenance costs are low relative to their capital cost, but which can

</p>
<p>experience catastrophic failure. Power transformers provide an example. In such 
</p>
<p>cases it is essential to take account of risk as equipment ages.
</p>
<p>Senior management should be involved in the assessment of the risks and con-
</p>
<p>sequences arising in any such situation, as their estimate is likely to be the best 
</p>
<p>available, and their ability to make a sound judgmental decision in terms of the 
</p>
<p>business as a whole may save needless and possibly inaccurate analysis.
</p>
<p>Where suitable data is available we can estimate levels of risk. For example, 
</p>
<p>an electricity transmission company with complete data on all failure and mainte-
</p>
<p>nance history of its transformers estimated the probability of major failure related 
</p>
<p>to age and to other measures of transformer utilization and condition. From this it 
</p>
<p>was able to draw up guidelines for preventive replacement polices which kept the 
</p>
<p>probability of major failure to low levels. It is generally not possible to eliminate 
</p>
<p>all risk. Where less data is available we may need to rely on technical judgment to 
</p>
<p>guide our replacement policies.
</p>
<p>26.7.1  Risk-Cost
</p>
<p>Risk-cost is the probability that an adverse event occurs multiplied by the cost if 
</p>
<p>it does. Although risk-cost can be a useful guide to our thinking, the product of 
</p>
<p>a very low probability multiplied by a very high cost does not always result in a 
</p>
<p>meaningful value when related to conventional financial analysis.
</p>
<p>For example, the probability of an old transformer failing in the coming year was 
</p>
<p>estimated at 1 % and the cost of this event at $5,000,000. The product of these num-
</p>
<p>bers gives a risk-cost of $50,000. $50,000 is too small an amount to warrant replace-
</p>
<p>ment, but in practice the senior management made the decision to replace based on 
</p>
<p>the potential impact of a major failure at the overall business and political level.
</p>
<p>26.8  Linear Assets1,2
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;linear asset&rdquo; is an asset which is physically long, consists of a series of 
</p>
<p> individually inexpensive sections or components, but delivers a valuable service, 
</p>
<p>with high costs if the service is interrupted. Examples are water mains, oil and 
</p>
<p>gas pipelines, roads, railway track, and electricity power lines. The critical factor 
</p>
<p>is service availability. Replacement problems associated with linear assets have 
</p>
<p> particular characteristics which are discussed here.

<p>26.7 Risk with Ageing Equipment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>472 26 Equipment Replacement Decisions
</p>
<p>26.8.1  Cost Structure
</p>
<p>Linear assets typically have the following features.
</p>
<p>&bull; There is a significant initial capital outlay.
</p>
<p>&bull; There are little or no operating costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Routine maintenance costs are low.
</p>
<p>&bull; For a long time there are few failures.
</p>
<p>&bull; There are minimal administrative costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Failures cause high costs to users.
</p>
<p>&bull; Failures are repaired promptly, usually as an urgent job.
</p>
<p>&bull; Short lengths of the asset can be repaired quickly and relatively cheaply.
</p>
<p>&bull; Eventually the asset condition deteriorates significantly.
</p>
<p>&bull; Eventually there are significant risk costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Repeated failures are unacceptable and eventually a major refurbishment is needed.
</p>
<p>&bull; The extent of and timing of refurbishment are hard to decide.
</p>
<p>&bull; Disposal cost is low.
</p>
<p>The key characteristic is the eventual occurrence of failures which have high costs 
</p>
<p>to users. Individual failures can be fixed and the cost of repair is relatively small, 
</p>
<p>but repeated failures are unacceptable. Guidelines for making the decision to 
</p>
<p>refurbish some or all of the asset can be:
</p>
<p>&bull; the failure rate, such as failures per kilometer per year,
</p>
<p>&bull; an availability figure which takes account of failure rate and time to repair 
</p>
<p> (outage time),
</p>
<p>&bull; a failure severity measure,
</p>
<p>&bull; a cost-based measure which assigns costs to the outages. In this case replacement 
</p>
<p>can occur when marginal cost exceeds the estimated EAC of the replacement,
</p>
<p>&bull; a risk-cost based measure for items which can be catastrophic if they fail, such 
</p>
<p>as trunk water mains.
</p>
<p>26.8.2  High Consequence Assets
</p>
<p>High consequence assets, such as trunk water mains, are assets that we do not 
</p>
<p>want to fail at all. Where risk comprises rare but very high consequence events, 
</p>
<p>such an event may not have occurred in the past and it will not be reflected in his-
</p>
<p>torical records. For trunk mains, we would expect to be making the replacement 
</p>
<p>decision without having a failure history.
</p>
<p>In such cases, we are dependent on predictive assessment which will indicate 
</p>
<p>at what stage in the degradation of the asset we will make a replacement. This is 
</p>
<p>primarily a technical assessment and may be based on a combination of observed 
</p>
<p>condition and technical information based on such factors as erosion or corrosion 
</p>
<p>rates, fatigue life, or wear rates. It is important that adequate steps are taken to 
</p>
<p>monitor the risks associated with high consequence assets and to act in time to </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>473
</p>
<p>avoid failure. High consequence assets feature an economic life shorter than their 
</p>
<p>physical life.
</p>
<p>The risk analysis involves the less tangible aspects of failure such as social 
</p>
<p>impact and image damage.
</p>
<p>26.8.3  Low Consequence, Long Life Asset Replacement
</p>
<p>Consider an asset type with low failure consequence, which has a high acquisition 
</p>
<p>cost, followed by a long period with little or no expense. This is typical of many 
</p>
<p>linear assets. Some failures are acceptable and the rate may be low when the asset 
</p>
<p>is new, so initially we may operate on a run-to-failure basis. Later, the failure rate 
</p>
<p>rises as the assets age, and will gradually become unacceptable. It is important to 
</p>
<p>monitor the failure rate so that we become aware of when to consider the introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of a replacement or refurbishment policy which goes beyond minimal repairs.
</p>
<p>Thus in this case we switch from an initial repair-only-on&mdash;failure policy to 
</p>
<p>a refurbishment policy once the failure rate becomes significant. The increase in 
</p>
<p>failure rate is not necessarily uniform across the population. For example, in an 
</p>
<p>electricity transmission network, lines close to the coast will be subject to faster 
</p>
<p>rates of corrosion than lines inland. This is due to salt laden air. Also, lines in 
</p>
<p>exposed open terrain will be subject to wind-induced vibration to a greater extent 
</p>
<p>than lines in sheltered locations, leading to possible fatigue failures.
</p>
<p>26.9  What Length of Asset Should Be Replaced?
</p>
<p>Another issue that arises with linear assets is deciding how much of the asset, 
</p>
<p>should be replaced in any one replacement episode.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of maintenance or replacement of linear assets it is convenient to 
</p>
<p>consider them as being made up of discrete sections. This may be driven by physi-
</p>
<p>cal attributes, e.g., the span between transmission line towers or sewer access shafts, 
</p>
<p>or by the limitations of data capture systems in providing detail of asset performance. 
</p>
<p>It may also be influenced by failure patterns or environmental conditions.
</p>
<p>What do we replace and what do we leave? Do we replace only individual sec-
</p>
<p>tions with a failure history? What do we do about sections with no failure history 
</p>
<p>but which are located adjacent to those being replaced?
</p>
<p>26.9.1  Cost Structure of Replacement
</p>
<p>With most linear assets there are economies of scale such that it is cheaper per 
</p>
<p>meter to replace longer lengths. This affects the decision as to how much of a 
</p>
<p>degraded asset should be replaced. Figure 26.6 shows the variation of fixed costs 
</p>
<p>26.8 Linear Assets</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>474 26 Equipment Replacement Decisions
</p>
<p>with price per meter and total length laid in a single episode for 150 mm water 
</p>
<p>mains. It is evident from Fig. 26.6 that the EAC of a section of a linear asset will 
</p>
<p>be dependent on the magnitude of the project by which it is acquired.
</p>
<p>The decision as to how much of an asset to replace in any one episode will 
</p>
<p>depend on a number of factors. These include:
</p>
<p>&bull; the physical practicalities of replacement,
</p>
<p>&bull; the relationship between the site establishment fixed costs,
</p>
<p>&bull; the length-related variable costs of replacement,
</p>
<p>&bull; the condition of the asset under consideration, and
</p>
<p>&bull; site-specific considerations.
</p>
<p>Fixed costs include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Site establishment;
</p>
<p>&bull; Notification to customers of a planned replacement;
</p>
<p>&bull; Social cost of disruptive event (outrage, loss of amenity);
</p>
<p>&bull; Administration (contract preparation, tendering, payment etc.).
</p>
<p>Variable costs include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Labor
</p>
<p>&bull; Plant
</p>
<p>&bull; Material
</p>
<p>&bull; Administration (contract admin and supervision)
</p>
<p>&bull; Social cost of extended disruption (traffic disruption, commercial  disruption, 
</p>
<p>residential access problems, noise, unsightliness, etc.). This is a cost that 
</p>
<p> displays an increasing rate with time.
</p>
<p>The cost structure of the replacement process is such that it imposes disincentives for 
</p>
<p>too small a replacement and for too big a replacement. We may therefore, surmise 
</p>
<p>that with all benefits and costs considered there will be a site-specific &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>replacement episode.

<p>26.9.2  Contiguous Replacement
</p>
<p>Consider the linear asset shown as &ldquo;Pipeline Condition&rdquo; in Fig. 26.7. This has sec-
</p>
<p>tions featuring good, medium, and poor condition distributed along its length.
</p>
<p>A number of options can be considered, such as:
</p>
<p>&bull; to replace only the poor sections one at a time in separate jobs,
</p>
<p>&bull; replace only the poor sections in one job,
</p>
<p>&bull; to replace the poor and adjacent medium sections in separate jobs,
</p>
<p>&bull; to replace a contiguous length including both poor sections and the sections in 
</p>
<p>between in a single job.
</p>
<p>Decisions must be made between these options and there is no simple formula. 
</p>
<p>The techniques already outlined can be used to evaluate particular cases.
</p>
<p>26.9.3  Linear Assets Conclusion
</p>
<p>Linear assets have specific characteristics which complicate the replacement pol-
</p>
<p>icy. Degradation can creep in gradually and may have serious consequences. The 
</p>
<p>factors outlined in this section form a basis for informed decisions on the replace-
</p>
<p>ment of linear assets. The actual decision in any particular case will depend on the 
</p>
<p>balance of condition, cost, and disruption factors, and will need to be made on a 
</p>
<p>case-by-case basis.

<p>476 26 Equipment Replacement Decisions
</p>
<p>&bull; On age or service life
</p>
<p>&bull; On failure
</p>
<p>It is also possible to use these policies in combination.
</p>
<p>26.10.1  Condition-Based Replacement
</p>
<p>A condition-based replacement is a replacement which is carried out when a com-
</p>
<p>ponent is still working satisfactorily, but inspection or monitoring shows that it has 
</p>
<p>degraded and can be expected to fail in the near future. Condition-based replace-
</p>
<p>ment is a sound policy if it is technically and economically feasible to apply an 
</p>
<p>effective condition monitoring policy to the component.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, the choice is between an age-based policy or a replace-only-on-fail-
</p>
<p>ure policy.
</p>
<p>26.10.2  Failure Replacement and Run-to-Failure
</p>
<p>A failure replacement is a replacement that occurs following the failure of a com-
</p>
<p>ponent in service. Whatever the policy, replacement will be required if the compo-
</p>
<p>nent actually fails. If no other policy is adopted, the policy will be to replace only 
</p>
<p>on failure, also known as run-to-failure. This may not be acceptable because of the 
</p>
<p>cost of failure and possible safety or environmental consequences.
</p>
<p>An example, where a run-to-failure policy is commonly applied, is with domes-
</p>
<p>tic lighting. The consequences of an individual light failing are not severe and 
</p>
<p>there is no suitable condition monitoring system. Redundant systems can generally 
</p>
<p>be suited to a run-to-failure policy, with the switch to a standby or parallel system 
</p>
<p>allowing time for replacement to occur.
</p>
<p>26.10.3  Age-Based or Service-Based Replacement
</p>
<p>An age-based or service-based replacement is a replacement which is carried out 
</p>
<p>when a component is still working satisfactorily, but we consider it advisable to 
</p>
<p>replace it on a basis of age or in terms of service life, such as flying-hours.
</p>
<p>Data on component ages must be kept for this policy to be applied. Age-based 
</p>
<p>replacement should not be applied where the failure rate is decreasing or constant, 
</p>
<p>as the new item will be no more reliable than the old. We therefore need to carry 
</p>
<p>out analysis or make a technical judgement as to the age at which the failure rate </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>477
</p>
<p>will increase. However, it may be necessary at times to make age-based replacement in 
</p>
<p>anticipation of a rising failure rate before another replacement opportunity arises. 
</p>
<p>Age-based rules commonly apply to safety-critical components such as pressure 
</p>
<p>safety valves and aero-engines. Methods for determining when the failure rate 
</p>
<p>starts to increase are discussed in Chap. 21, Sect. 21.7.4.1 under the headings of 
</p>
<p>statistical analysis and age exploration.

</p>
<p>26.11.1  Vehicle Replacement Exercise
</p>
<p>A vehicle currently has a resale value of $25,000 and is estimated to have a resale 
</p>
<p>value of $18,000 in a year&rsquo;s time. The maintenance cost of the vehicle for the 
</p>
<p>coming year is $3,500, assumed to be incurred at the end of year.
</p>
<p>The life cycle EAC of a new vehicle is estimated at $10,000 per year. Should 
</p>
<p>the old vehicle be replaced now?
</p>
<p>a. assuming zero interest; and
</p>
<p>b. assuming interest at 10 % p.a.
</p>
<p>26.11.2  Transformer Replacement Exercise
</p>
<p>An electricity transmission company has a transformer which is currently 40-years 
</p>
<p>old. The operating and maintenance costs for this item for the next 4 years have been 
</p>
<p>assessed as follows. Assume that these costs are incurred at the END of the respec-
</p>
<p>tive years. Assume that the old transformer will not be kept for more than 4 years.
</p>
<p>Year 1 2 3 4
</p>
<p>Cost 14,250 14,200 24,000 45,450
</p>
<p>A new transformer of modern design can be purchased for $300,000. The new 
</p>
<p>transformer can be assumed to have a 40-year life. The cost of capital is 8 % and 
</p>
<p>the 40-year annuity factor at 8 % per annum is 11.9246. The annual operating and 
</p>
<p>maintenance cost for the new transformer is estimated at an EAC of $2,700 per 
</p>
<p>annum.
</p>
<p> (a) On the basis of this data, at what age should the old transformer be replaced? 
</p>
<p>Show your working.
</p>
<p> (b) If the old transformer needed a repair, costing $30,000, should this repair be 
</p>
<p>carried out or should the old transformer be replaced now? Assume that the 
</p>
<p>old transformer has no net disposal value. Assume that this repair will not 
</p>
<p>affect the future costs shown in the table. Show your working.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to discuss a number of financial topics beyond 
</p>
<p>the basic financial analysis methods that were introduced in Chap. 5. These top-
</p>
<p>ics are important in the management of assets. An understanding of these topics 
</p>
<p>will be of value in contributing to asset management decisions. Outcomes You will 
</p>
<p>learn about aspects of business financing, about comparing and selecting projects 
</p>
<p>and issues involved in leasing. The chapter concludes with a consideration of the 
</p>
<p>concepts of fixed and variable costs and break-even analysis.
</p>
<p>27.1  Debt and Equity Financing
</p>
<p>The capital used by a company generally has one of two types of source: debt  capital 
</p>
<p>or equity capital.
</p>
<p>Debt capital is money borrowed from a bank or other source and the cost is the 
</p>
<p>loan interest rate. The repayment schedule is a firm commitment and the business 
</p>
<p>is insolvent if it cannot be met.
</p>
<p>Equity capital is money provided by investors, either by the purchase of shares 
</p>
<p>or as retained earnings. The cost reflects the expectations of shareholders, who 
</p>
<p>benefit from dividends and also from any increase in the value of the company. 
</p>
<p>Usually the expected return on equity is higher than on debt, but if business is bad, 
</p>
<p>dividends can be reduced or omitted without the company becoming insolvent.
</p>
<p>Gearing is the ratio of debt to debt plus equity. Since the interest on debt capi-
</p>
<p>tal must be paid, a highly geared company is at relatively high risk.
</p>
<p>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is the cost of capital to the company, 
</p>
<p>taking an average of the proportion of debt and the interest rate on debt with the 
</p>
<p>proportion of equity and the expected return on equity.

<p>482 27 Further Financial Topics
</p>
<p>27.2  Comparison and Selection of Projects
</p>
<p>Asset investment criteria were introduced in Chap. 5, Sect. 5.4. Some additional 
</p>
<p>considerations beyond the basic methods are outlined here.
</p>
<p>27.2.1  Project Comparability
</p>
<p>In making project comparisons it is important to ensure that the options are treated 
</p>
<p>comparably in relation to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Starting conditions;
</p>
<p>&bull; Ending conditions;
</p>
<p>&bull; Project duration and duration of service;
</p>
<p>&bull; Performance and output planned and achievable.
</p>
<p>The suggested basic method is to rank projects by their Profitability Index at the 
</p>
<p>Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return. Where different production capacities are 
</p>
<p>involved we need to consider cost per unit of production.
</p>
<p>27.2.2  Planning Horizon
</p>
<p>In analyzing an investment project we need to choose a planning horizon or plan-
</p>
<p>ning cycle. Care must be exercised to ensure that the choice of horizon does not 
</p>
<p>bias the result. Calculating an NPV for a finite horizon is the easiest method to 
</p>
<p>comprehend. Be careful to set reasonable terminal values, such as written down 
</p>
<p>values or resale values, depending on the age of items at the horizon. Discounting 
</p>
<p>makes terminal values less critical in long projects. Annualized costs are useful as 
</p>
<p>a basis for comparing costs incurred with differing life cycle durations.
</p>
<p>27.2.3  With and Without Analysis
</p>
<p>The financial measures described in Chap. 5 focused on specific discrete projects. 
</p>
<p>In practice, projects may not be mutually exclusive, so that the choice of one pro-
</p>
<p>ject may mean that one of the others is not needed, or has to be modified. More 
</p>
<p>generally, with many complex factors interacting, it may be advisable to consider 
</p>
<p>the desirability of a project on a &ldquo;with or without&rdquo; basis. That is, we consider sce-
</p>
<p>narios of what will happen if we do the project compared with what will happen if 
</p>
<p>we do not do it. This approach can often clarify the situation and lead to a decision 
</p>
<p>to proceed, not proceed, or to modify the project.</p>

</p>
<p>27.3  Inflation
</p>
<p>Inflation means that identical goods cost more money now than they did a year 
</p>
<p>ago. Equivalently, it means that prices were lower for the same items in the past. 
</p>
<p>Deflation, on the other hand, corresponds to a decrease in the price of goods with 
</p>
<p>time. The inflation rate is distinct from the interest rate. However, the two are not 
</p>
<p>entirely unrelated, as the interest rate will normally exceed the inflation rate, other-
</p>
<p>wise there will be no attraction in saving or investing.
</p>
<p>Historical average inflation rates are published by statistical authorities, for 
</p>
<p>example, the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Where we wish to compare costs which 
</p>
<p>are incurred a few years apart, we can bring them to a common reference date. 
</p>
<p>This is usually the current year, and we then refer to the money unit as &ldquo;today&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>dollars.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The expression &ldquo;real terms&rdquo; is used to indicate that a money quantity has been 
</p>
<p>adjusted to allow for inflation. The unadjusted figures we refer to as &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>dollars. The inflation rate usually varies from year to year.
</p>
<p>27.3.1  Adjusting Historical Costs
</p>
<p>Consider a maintenance cost of $6,500 incurred 2 years ago. We may wish to 
</p>
<p>compare that in real terms with the cost of a similar task performed in the current 
</p>
<p>year. If the inflation rate was 7 % last year and 9 % the year before, we must first 
</p>
<p>inflate the cost by 9 % and then inflate the result by further 7 % to put the cost into 
</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s dollars. In this case the result would be:
</p>
<p>Try this question.
</p>
<p>(27.1)Cost in Today&rsquo;s Dollars = 6, 500 &times; (1 + 0.09) &times; (1 + 0.07) = 7, 581
</p>
<p>27.3 Inflation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>484 27 Further Financial Topics
</p>
<p>$20,000,000 was spent last year on maintaining a water supply system,
</p>
<p>$20,500,000 is budgeted for this year. Inflation between the years was 4 %.
</p>
<p>Which of the following is true?
</p>
<p>a. Expenditure has increased,
</p>
<p>b. Expenditure has declined in real terms.
</p>
<p>(Answer: Both)
</p>
<p>27.3.2  Real Rate of Interest
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;real&rdquo; rate of interest is the annual increase in the value of invested money in 
</p>
<p>terms of its purchasing power, allowing for inflation. In long-term financial analy-
</p>
<p>ses, such as life cycle costing, it is common to use the real rate of interest rather 
</p>
<p>than the bank interest rate on loans.
</p>
<p>The real rate of interest is approximately equal to the bank interest rate minus the 
</p>
<p>inflation rate. Thus if the bank interest rate is 9 % and the inflation rate is 4 % then the 
</p>
<p>real rate of interest is approximately 5 %. The precise relationship is given in Eq. 27.2.
</p>
<p>It is not unusual to use the approximation t = r &minus; f, rather than the exact formula.
</p>
<p>27.3.3  Adjusting Future Costs
</p>
<p>Inflation and interest rates vary widely over time, and are hard to predict. In assess-
</p>
<p>ing real costs or values over long periods, great accuracy cannot be expected. Also, 
</p>
<p>some items are not subject to inflation. For example, maintenance costs will inflate, 
</p>
<p>but annual repayments and depreciation based on the original acquisition cost of an 
</p>
<p>item will not inflate. As a guideline, in making financial planning calculations, adjust 
</p>
<p>all inflatable amounts into today&rsquo;s dollars and use the real rate of interest.
</p>
<p>27.4  Asset Valuation
</p>
<p>Asset valuation is subject to accounting rules and the relevant rules should be 
</p>
<p>identified and applied. An asset manager should consult accounting professionals 
</p>
<p>in regard to the preferred method for the circumstances.
</p>
<p>r = bank interest rate as a decimal
</p>
<p>f = inflation rate as a decimal
</p>
<p>t = real interest rate as a decimal
</p>
<p>(27.2)t = (r &minus; f)
/
</p>
<p>(1 + f)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>485
</p>
<p>The traditional financial value of an asset is the acquisition cost minus the accu-
</p>
<p>mulated depreciation. This is the conventional book value. This value is objective; 
</p>
<p>that is, anyone applying the same rule will get the same result.
</p>
<p>Another concept is &ldquo;fair value&rdquo; which involves estimating the Depreciated 
</p>
<p>Current Replacement Cost.1
</p>
<p>27.4.1  Current Replacement Cost
</p>
<p>The asset manager is generally concerned with maintaining an ongoing provision 
</p>
<p>of assets. This involves making financial provision for the declining value of assets 
</p>
<p>over their lifetime, but also involves considering changes in service requirements, 
</p>
<p>in technology, and in the condition of particular assets. Relevant concepts are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Current Replacement Cost (CRC) is the cost which would be incurred if the 
</p>
<p>item had to be replaced with the modern equivalent. This will take account of 
</p>
<p>price changes, technical and regulatory developments, and changes to service 
</p>
<p>expectations which have occurred since the original item was acquired.
</p>
<p>&bull; Expected Useful Life (EUL) is an estimate of the life of an asset, taking account 
</p>
<p>of environmental or operational factors which may give a life which is different 
</p>
<p>from the effective life set by accounting rules. The default value, however, is the 
</p>
<p>effective life.
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset condition. See also Sect. 9.8 of this book. Normal depreciation reflects 
</p>
<p>some loss of condition in a general sense. If the condition of an asset is signifi-
</p>
<p>cantly different from the norm for its age, then we need to take account of this.
</p>
<p>&bull; Expected Remaining Life (ERL). For an asset in average condition the Expected 
</p>
<p>Remaining Life is the Expected Useful Life minus the Age. If the condition is 
</p>
<p>significantly different from the norm for its age, then an ERL specific to the par-
</p>
<p>ticular asset may be assigned.
</p>
<p>27.4.1.1  Depreciated Current Replacement Cost
</p>
<p>To obtain an asset valuation based on current costs we assess the current replace-
</p>
<p>ment cost of the item and then depreciate that to allow for the age of the current 
</p>
<p>item in relation to its expected useful life. We refer to the result as the Depreciated 
</p>
<p>Current Replacement Cost (DRC). The formula for the DRC of an item in average 
</p>
<p>condition is:
</p>
<p>1 Fair value is defined in AASB116. Fair value measurement is considered in AASB13.
</p>
<p>(27.3)DRC = CRC &lowast; (EUL &minus; Age)
/
</p>
<p>EUL.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>486 27 Further Financial Topics
</p>
<p>For an item whose condition is such that its Expected Remaining Life (ERL) dif-
</p>
<p>fers from the average, the formula is:
</p>
<p>For example, consider an item with an effective useful life of 40 years and which 
</p>
<p>is currently 20 years old and is in average condition. Its current replacement cost is 
</p>
<p>assessed at $50,000. Assuming straight line depreciation the assessed DRC by this 
</p>
<p>method is $50,000 &times; 20/40 = $25,000.
</p>
<p>If the item is in poorer condition than average, we might assess its remain-
</p>
<p>ing life at 10 years, even though it is only 20 years old. In this case the DRC is 
</p>
<p>$50,000 &times; 10/40 = $12,500.
</p>
<p>27.4.2  Deprival Value
</p>
<p>This is the cost that would be incurred if the organization no longer had the item. 
</p>
<p>The idea is that a like-with-like replacement would not necessarily occur due to 
</p>
<p>wider changes in the business environment. One the one hand, an organization 
</p>
<p>might be happy not to posses some of the assets which appear in its books, in 
</p>
<p>which case the deprival value can be zero. At the other end of the scale, the dep-
</p>
<p>rival value takes account of how much worse off the owner would be if they did 
</p>
<p>not have the asset, but wanted to continue on with business, taking all current and 
</p>
<p>future considerations into account. For example, a person owns an old car with 
</p>
<p>zero book value and zero resale value. However, the car serves the purposes of the 
</p>
<p>owner, who would be faced with buying another if they were deprived of the old 
</p>
<p>one. The deprival value can be highly volatile as circumstances change. This con-
</p>
<p>cept appears in some regulatory schemes.
</p>
<p>27.4.3  Asset Value Index
</p>
<p>An asset value index is a number which gives an indication of the value of the 
</p>
<p>assets relative to the value of similar new assets. If we are using Depreciated 
</p>
<p>Current Replacement Cost as the valuation method, we define an asset value index 
</p>
<p>as the ratio of the Depreciated Current Replacement Cost (DRC) to the Current 
</p>
<p>Replacement Cost:
</p>
<p>Consider an asset with an effective life of 10 years, with straight line depreciation; 
</p>
<p>when it is 5 years old its Asset Value Index, in percentage terms, will be 50 %.
</p>
<p>The index can be applied to a group of assets by dividing the total Depreciated 
</p>
<p>Current Replacement Cost of the group by the total Current Replacement Cost of 
</p>
<p>the group. For the group, the Asset Value Index is given by:
</p>
<p>(27.4)DRC = (CRC &lowast; ERL)
/
</p>
<p>EUL.
</p>
<p>(27.5)Asset Value Index = DRC/CRC</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>487
</p>
<p>The index can be applied to the whole asset portfolio of an organization, so that a 
</p>
<p>plant with all new assets would have an Asset Value Index of 100 %, while a plant 
</p>
<p>with all very old assets which had been fully depreciated would have an Asset 
</p>
<p>Value Index of 0 %. Taking it across the range of a company&rsquo;s assets, it indicates 
</p>
<p>how the assets stack up in terms of their age relative to their effective lives. If the 
</p>
<p>index is well below 50 %, then major capital expenditure is likely to be needed in 
</p>
<p>the near future.
</p>
<p>The Asset Value Index also serves as a pointer to the actions of management in 
</p>
<p>relation to fixed assets. If the index is falling, we should expect evidence that the 
</p>
<p>management is initiating plans for renewal at the appropriate times, and for the 
</p>
<p>financing of the new items through a sinking fund or retained profits, for example. 
</p>
<p>The Asset Value Index should be reported in the annual accounts, giving a direct 
</p>
<p>insight into the asset health of the company. A low value does not indicate a bad 
</p>
<p>situation provided that financial provision has been made for the replacements 
</p>
<p>which will soon be needed.
</p>
<p>27.5  Sinking Fund
</p>
<p>A sinking fund is money that we accumulate so that we have it available when 
</p>
<p>replacements or refurbishments of assets are needed. For example, the owners of 
</p>
<p>an apartment block which has a swimming pool will want to refurbish the pool 
</p>
<p>to current standards from time to time. To cover the cost of replacement or refur-
</p>
<p>bishment we need to build up the sinking fund over the period leading to the time 
</p>
<p>when the expenditure is needed. The guideline for how much should be in the 
</p>
<p>sinking fund at any time is:
</p>
<p>If the sinking fund is held in an interest bearing account, we can take advantage of 
</p>
<p>the interest generated. The discounted cash flow analysis of this situation is docu-
</p>
<p>mented in finance textbooks.
</p>
<p>27.6  Leasing
</p>
<p>Leasing is hiring equipment rather than purchasing it. The lessee has the use of the 
</p>
<p>equipment, but ownership remains with the lessor.
</p>
<p>Asset Value Index =
Group Total Depreciated Current Replacement Cost
</p>
<p>Group Total Current Replacement Cost
</p>
<p>Sinking Fund Amount = Current Replacement Cost
</p>
<p>&minus; Depreciated Replacement Cost

</p>
<p>Features of leasing are:
</p>
<p>a. Often the cheapest way to meet a short-term requirement;
</p>
<p>b. Avoids a capital requirement.
</p>
<p>c. Avoids long-term commitment to specific assets, providing flexibility
</p>
<p>d. Reduces fixed costs. The fixed costs associated with the equipment become the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the lessor;
</p>
<p>e. Will generally be more expensive in meeting a long-term commitment, as the 
</p>
<p>lessor will need to make a profit;
</p>
<p>f. The whole cost is tax deductible in current year.
</p>
<p>g. Risk in equipment reliability and performance is transferred to lessor.
</p>
<p>In making a financial comparison, compare the lease cost rate with the EAC of 
</p>
<p>ownership, or compare the total leasing cost with the NPV of ownership over the 
</p>
<p>corresponding period.
</p>
<p>27.7  Loan Repayment
</p>
<p>Because interest payments are tax deductible, in some applications we may wish 
</p>
<p>to calculate separately the amount of interest paid and the amount of capital 
</p>
<p>repaid year by year on a loan. Suppose that we borrow an amount, known as the 
</p>
<p>Principal, at a given interest rate, repayable by equal annual installments over a 
</p>
<p>number of years. The Excel functions PPMT and IPMT give the capital and inter-
</p>
<p>est repayments year by year.
</p>
<p>Figure 27.1 shows an example of the use of the Excel functions PPMT and 
</p>
<p>IPMT to calculate loan repayment principal and interest. The loan amount is 
</p>
<p>Fig. 27.1  Loan repayment calculations</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>$10,000 shown in cell B1. The interest rate is 9 % shown in cell B2. The repay-
</p>
<p>ment period is 5 years shown in cell B3. The repayments of principal are shown 
</p>
<p>in row 5 and of interest in row 6. As an example, the PPMT function for cell C5 
</p>
<p>appears in the function field. PPMT and IPMT reverse the sign from that of the 
</p>
<p>Principal, so a minus sign has been used in the function field to give positive 
</p>
<p>answers.
</p>
<p>27.8  Fixed Costs, Variable Costs, and Break-Even Analysis
</p>
<p>Fixed costs are costs which do not vary with the volume of business. Variable 
</p>
<p>costs do vary with the volume of business. Examples of fixed costs are:
</p>
<p>&bull; The interest on loans for the purchase of plant or buildings;
</p>
<p>&bull; The cost of inspection of a boiler which is required to be carried out annually, 
</p>
<p>regardless of the extent of utilization of the boiler.
</p>
<p>Examples of variable costs are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Costs of materials used in manufacturing;
</p>
<p>&bull; Fuel costs which depend on volume of production or vehicle utilization.
</p>
<p>The profit made by a company in a given year is based on the sales revenue minus 
</p>
<p>the sum of variable and fixed costs. Products have an operating profit margin, 
</p>
<p>given by their selling price minus the variable cost of production. As a year pro-
</p>
<p>ceeds and sales are made, the cumulative operating profit increases, initially to 
</p>
<p>cover the fixed costs and then to yield an overall profit. At a given operating mar-
</p>
<p>gin, a business is more assured of avoiding a loss making situation if its fixed costs 
</p>
<p>are low. This also applies even if the reduction in fixed costs causes a moderate 
</p>
<p>loss in operating margin. Figure 27.2 illustrates the situation.

<p>490 27 Further Financial Topics
</p>
<p>For this reason, there is always a desire to reduce fixed costs. This can lead 
</p>
<p>to pressure to reduce maintenance costs, which often include a large element of 
</p>
<p>fixed costs. But there is then the danger that if the maintenance budget is too low, 
</p>
<p>greater losses will occur, due to lack of machine availability, and that catastrophic 
</p>
<p>failures may occur. Awareness of the fixed cost issue helps managers to assess the 
</p>
<p>role of fixed and variable costs in a budget setting.
</p>
<p>Leasing, renting, and outsourcing are activities that convert fixed costs to vari-
</p>
<p>able costs. They give a business greater flexibility in the event of a downturn in 
</p>
<p>sales. However, if business is good, they tend to reduce profits by being more 
</p>
<p>expensive than direct ownership.
</p>
<p>27.9  Regulation
</p>
<p>Regulation by government authorities is introduced to avoid excess profits in 
</p>
<p>monopolies. Typically, this occurs when utilities are privatized in the electricity, 
</p>
<p>water, gas, road, and rail industries. It is important to ensure that the regulatory 
</p>
<p>regime does not discourage continuing investment.
</p>
<p>27.9.1  Methods
</p>
<p>The aim of the regulator is to limit the profit of the company to an acceptable 
</p>
<p>level. This can be done by limiting the prices which to company can charge, or by 
</p>
<p>limiting the revenue that they can generate. The following methods may be used:
</p>
<p>&bull; Pricing is restricted to cost plus
</p>
<p>&bull; Price cap. Prices are capped by the regulator
</p>
<p>&bull; Self-regulation&mdash;Set own rules but need to justify to regulator
</p>
<p>&bull; Revenue cap&mdash;based on asset replacement value or on depreciated asset 
</p>
<p>replacement value
</p>
<p>In an example of the revenue cap case the Maximum Allowable Revenue in year 
</p>
<p>(MAR) is calculated as:
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>WACC Weighted Average Cost of Capital
</p>
<p>WDV Written Down Value of the assets
</p>
<p>D Depreciation in a year
</p>
<p>opex Operating expense
</p>
<p>MAR = Return on capital + Return of capital + opex
</p>
<p>MAR = (WACC &lowast; WDV) + D + opex</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>491
</p>
<p>The regulator may specify that the operating expense should grow at less than 
</p>
<p>the inflation rate, a rule known as CPI-X. There may be bonuses or deductions 
</p>
<p>related to performance parameters such as on-time running of railways, power out-
</p>
<p>ages, water pressure loss.
</p>
<p>A theoretical model used in regulation is the Capital Asset Pricing Model. A 
</p>
<p>concept to come out of this is the risk parameter referred to as &ldquo;beta&rdquo;. A beta value 
</p>
<p>of 1 represents the risk level of an average stock market investment. A beta value 
</p>
<p>of less than one represents a safer investment, traditionally such as a utility. A beta 
</p>
<p>value greater than one represents an investment which is considered riskier than 
</p>
<p>the market average.
</p>
<p>27.9.2  Need for Adequate Returns
</p>
<p>If regulation provides too little return to a utility, investment in plant may decline, 
</p>
<p>resulting in power shortages. Short-term investments (e.g., gas turbine power 
</p>
<p>plants) may be made instead of long term. An example is a gas pipeline built on 
</p>
<p>a government commitment to a gas retail price of $1 per unit, but this was later 
</p>
<p>reduced to 81 cents by the regulator, sending the pipeline owners into liquidation.
</p>
<p>If regulated returns are based on book asset values, thus penalizing older assets, 
</p>
<p>there will be a switch from a maintenance and refurbishment focus to the early 
</p>
<p>acquisition of new plant.
</p>
<p>27.9.3  Stranded Assets
</p>
<p>A stranded asset is an asset which has lost value due to a change in circumstances. 
</p>
<p>Example: Bell Bay power station in Tasmania runs on natural gas and produces 
</p>
<p>power at a cost of about $50 per Megawatt-hour. A cable, known as Basslink, was 
</p>
<p>built later which supplies electricity to Tasmania from coal fired power stations 
</p>
<p>in Victoria, where costs are about $14 per Megawatt-hour. Bell Bay became a 
</p>
<p>stranded asset (based on a Tasmanian newspaper report dated 1 June 2005).
</p>
<p>27.10  Concluding Discussion
</p>
<p>The primary role of the asset manager in regard to asset-based financial deci-
</p>
<p>sions is to ensure that decisions are in accord with the physical realities of the 
</p>
<p>asset situation. This involves providing accurate data and sound technical assump-
</p>
<p>tions which underpin the management decisions. An important part of the pro-
</p>
<p>cess is good communication between the asset management and finance groups. 
</p>
<p>To achieve this communication, it is important that asset managers understand the 
</p>

<p>27.11.2  An Asset Investment Case Study
</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the use of the Profit and Loss account and an 
</p>
<p>analysis of cash flows to evaluate the financial merits of a proposed development.
</p>
<p>27.11.2.1  Data
</p>
<p>The Token Power Company has the opportunity to develop a gas fired power sta-
</p>
<p>tion to provide electrical power for an industrial site. The cost data are shown in 
</p>
<p>Fig. 27.3. For purposes of this example, the life of the plant has been set at a nomi-
</p>
<p>nal 7 years. The plant is to be depreciated by the straight line method over 7 years.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 27.3 we see that the initial cost of the plant is $50 million. This is to be 
</p>
<p>covered by a $30 million loan and $20 million in equity. The loan is to be repaid 
</p>
<p>over 7 years. The revenue from the sale of electrical power is estimated at $135 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>493
</p>
<p>million per year and the cost of providing this power (mainly the purchase of gas) 
</p>
<p>is $100 million per year. Figure 27.3 also shows the interest rate on the loan at 
</p>
<p>8 %, the company tax rate at 30 % and two interest rates used in planning analy-
</p>
<p>ses, namely a Planning Rate of 10 % and the Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return 
</p>
<p>(MARR) of 15 %.
</p>
<p>Your aim is to determine whether this Power Plant will be a good investment. 
</p>
<p>Will it make a profit? What will be the payback period? What will be the Net 
</p>
<p>Present Value over the 7 year period? Should we go ahead with the building of the 
</p>
<p>power plant on the basis of the given data?
</p>
<p>27.12  Exercise Solutions
</p>
<p>27.12.1  Self-Assessment Quiz Solution
</p>
<p> 1. Debt capital
</p>
<p>  Debt capital is money borrowed from a bank or other source and the cost is 
</p>
<p>the loan interest rate. The repayment schedule is a firm commitment and the 
</p>
<p>business is insolvent if it cannot be met.
</p>
<p> 2. Equity capital
</p>
<p>  Equity capital is money provided by investors, either by the purchase of 
</p>
<p>shares or as retained earnings.
</p>
<p> 3. Gearing
</p>
<p>  Gearing is the ratio of debt to debt plus equity.
</p>
<p> 4. Weighted Average Cost of Capital
</p>
<p>  Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is the cost of capital to the com-
</p>
<p>pany, taking an average of the proportion of debt and the interest rate on debt 
</p>
<p>with the proportion of equity and the expected return on equity.
</p>
<p> 5. Real rate of interest
</p>
<p>  The real rate of interest is the annual increase in the value of invested money 
</p>
<p>in terms of its purchasing power, allowing for inflation.

<p>  The normal method of valuation of an asset is the acquisition cost minus the 
</p>
<p>accumulated depreciation.
</p>
<p> 7. What is meant by the Current Replacement Cost of an item?
</p>
<p>  Current Replacement Cost (CRC) is the cost which would be incurred if an 
</p>
<p>existing item has to be replaced with the modern equivalent.
</p>
<p> 8. What is a Sinking Fund?
</p>
<p>  A sinking fund is money that we accumulate so that we have it available when 
</p>
<p>replacements or refurbishments of assets are needed.
</p>
<p> 9. Identify four or more features of leasing rather than purchasing equipment.
</p>
<p>  Features of leasing are:
</p>
<p>a. Often the cheapest way to meet a short-term requirement;
</p>
<p>b.  Avoids a capital requirement. This is an advantage if there is a restriction 
</p>
<p>on available capital.
</p>
<p>c. Avoids long-term commitment to specific assets, providing flexibility
</p>
<p>d.  Reduces fixed costs. The fixed costs associated with the equipment 
</p>
<p>become the responsibility of the lessee;
</p>
<p>e. Will generally be more expensive in meeting a long-term commitment;
</p>
<p>f. The whole cost is tax deductible in the current year.
</p>
<p>g. Risk in equipment reliability and performance is transferred to lessor.
</p>
<p> 10. What is the difference between fixed and variable costs?
</p>
<p>  Fixed costs are costs which do not vary with the volume of business. Variable 
</p>
<p>costs do vary with the volume of business.
</p>
<p>27.12.2  Asset Investment Case Study Solution
</p>
<p>27.12.2.1  Profit and Loss Accounts
</p>
<p>In order to determine the profitability of the proposal we develop projected Profit 
</p>
<p>and Loss accounts for the 7-year period. Figure 27.4 shows this.
</p>
<p>Row 13 shows the projected revenue of $135,000,000 per year.
</p>
<p>Row 14 shows the operating costs incurred in generating the revenue.
</p>
<p>Row 15 shows the operating profit.
</p>
<p>The initial cost of the plant, $50 million, is depreciated linearly over seven 
</p>
<p>years as shown in row 16. The $30 million loan is repaid over the 7 years. The 
</p>
<p>Excel functions PMT, IPMT and PPMT are used in rows 17, 18, and 19 to cal-
</p>
<p>culate the annual repayments and the split of these between interest expense and 
</p>
<p>capital repayments. The interest expense is tax deductable.
</p>
<p>The taxable income is then calculated (row 21) and also the tax paid (or to be 
</p>
<p>paid) at row 22. This gives the profit (after tax) shown at row 23. In round figures 
</p>
<p>and without discounting, the profit is approximately $25 million per year. We need 
</p>
<p>to relate this to accepted criteria for return on investment.</p>

<p>27.12.2.2  Investment Analysis for the Power System Project
</p>
<p>To evaluate the Power System project we apply the following methods:
</p>
<p>&bull; Payback Period
</p>
<p>&bull; Net Present Value
</p>
<p>&bull; Internal rate of Return
</p>
<p>Payback Period
</p>
<p>The calculation of the payback period is shown in Fig. 27.5 at rows 25&ndash;29. The 
</p>
<p>amount invested in the project is $50 million, but this reduces as the loan is 
</p>
<p>repaid. The equity plus loan remaining in the project is shown at row 28. The 
</p>
<p>cumulative present value of the profit is shown in row 27. The payback period 
</p>
<p>is reached when the cumulative present value of the profit exceeds the equity 
</p>
<p>plus loan remaining in the project. At that point our costs are recovered. This 
</p>
<p>occurs by the end of year 2, so the payback period is 2 years. This is a positive 
</p>
<p>indicator for this investment, as the short payback period indicates that there 
</p>
<p>is relatively little risk of our forecasts going wrong before the investment is 
</p>
<p>recovered.

</p>
<p>Net Present Value
</p>
<p>Calculate the cash flow year by year for the project and use this to calculate the 
</p>
<p>NPV of the project. Note that in the spreadsheet we have used &ldquo;year zero&rdquo; to hold 
</p>
<p>the initial costs. In year zero the cash flow is &minus;$20 million, which is the equity 
</p>
<p>invested, and in subsequent years the cash flow is given by:
</p>
<p>This is shown in row 32.
</p>
<p>The NPV of the cash flow, including the initial equity input, is then calculated 
</p>
<p>and shown at row 33.
</p>
<p>The result is $83,992,720. This is the value of the project. The calculations so 
</p>
<p>far were carried out at the Planning Rate of 10 % interest. We see that the invest-
</p>
<p>ment of $20 million in equity produces a return of $83,992,720 on this basis. This 
</p>
<p>is clearly a good investment.
</p>
<p>Internal Rate of Return
</p>
<p>Our next step is to calculate the internal rate of return corresponding to the cash flows 
</p>
<p>in row 32. We use the Excel IRR function and get the value of 107 %. This is shown 
</p>
<p>at Cell B35. This confirms that this is an excellent investment and is well above the 
</p>
<p>Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR) which was specified as 15 %.
</p>
<p>Return on Investment
</p>
<p>The value of the assets involved in the project vary over the period of the invest-
</p>
<p>ment, starting at $50 million and finishing at zero. Averaging these figures gives an 
</p>
<p>average asset value of $25 million. The annual profit is approximately $25 million 
</p>
<p>also, so the return on investment is about 100 % per annum. We have not formal-
</p>
<p>ized this in the spreadsheet as it is only a rough calculation.
</p>
<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>The power station is a good investment. It has a short payback period, a substantial 
</p>
<p>net present value in relation to the equity investment and an internal rate of return 
</p>
<p>which is well above the hurdle rate. We should go ahead.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to introduce and to give examples of  
</p>
<p>indicators of asset performance and to discuss auditing and review of the asset 
</p>
<p>management system itself. Outcomes After reading this chapter you will be aware 
</p>
<p>of the role of performance indicators and of some of the factors to consider in cre-
</p>
<p>ating and applying them. You will have available some examples of performance 
</p>
<p>indicators in specific applications. You will be aware of the need for audit of the 
</p>
<p>asset management system and the requirement for review of the system to ensure 
</p>
<p>its continuing effectiveness.
</p>
<p>28.1  Key Performance Indicators1,2
</p>
<p>Key performance indicators are measurable quantities which are intended to show 
</p>
<p>the extent to which a system is meeting the expectations which are placed on it. 
</p>
<p>Performance indicators assist with:
</p>
<p>&bull; Providing a high-level indication of how well activities are being managed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Highlighting areas that need attention.
</p>
<p>Performance indicators are used to measure the performance achievements of 
</p>
<p>systems. They show how well an asset, or system of assets is meeting its stated 
</p>
<p>purpose. They will usually relate to defined levels of service. They are therefore a 
</p>
<p>valuable guideline for users, customers, and senior management in assessing and 
</p>
<p>comparing performance across time periods and across comparable systems.
</p>
<p>A range of performance measures suited to public works organizations is listed 
</p>
<p>in the International Infrastructure Management Manual Sect. 2.2.3. Indicators may 
</p>
<p>be linked to payments or to penalties in performance contracts. Responsibilities

<p>498 28 Performance, Audit, and Review
</p>
<p>for nonconformance and constraints on performance need to be recognized in  
</p>
<p>creating these contracts. At the operational level, performance indicators are useful 
</p>
<p>to managers as rapid pointers to how a system is performing and as an indication 
</p>
<p>of areas of strength and weakness.
</p>
<p>Performance indicators should ideally be designed so that they do not affect the 
</p>
<p>behavior of participants, other than in motivating genuine performance improve-
</p>
<p>ments. In practice, performance indicators can have a motivating or demotivating 
</p>
<p>effect depending on how they affect particular people or groups. If maintenance 
</p>
<p>work done while machinery is idle for operational reasons creates &ldquo;unavailability&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>which counts against maintenance, then the maintenance opportunity will not be 
</p>
<p>taken. If the cost of tires is a charged to the operations budget, operators will have 
</p>
<p>more motivation to drive carefully than if the cost comes out of the maintenance 
</p>
<p>budget. Service providers can indulge in what is known as &lsquo;pencil whipping&rsquo;, 
</p>
<p>which means making moves designed specifically to meet or beat the indicator. 
</p>
<p>For example, a performance indicator on completed repair tasks may be circum-
</p>
<p>vented by closing off one job ahead of a deadline and then starting up another job 
</p>
<p>to finish the remaining work. Thus the danger of a performance indicator is that 
</p>
<p>persons assessed on the basis of an indicator will work to the indicator, but not 
</p>
<p>necessarily for the good of the systems as a whole.
</p>
<p>Performance measures are subject to random variation, and to decide formally 
</p>
<p>whether a variation is significant or not, statistical analysis, or at least, an aware-
</p>
<p>ness of statistical principles is needed.
</p>
<p>Some examples of indicators are given in the following sections.
</p>
<p>28.1.1  Railway System Indicators
</p>
<p>In a railway system, some indicators are:
</p>
<p>&bull; % of planned train-kilometers delivered per month
</p>
<p>&bull; % of services no more than 5 min late
</p>
<p>&bull; Passenger-minutes late
</p>
<p>&bull; Train cancelations %
</p>
<p>&bull; Train-minutes late
</p>
<p>28.1.2  Water Supply System Indicators
</p>
<p>In a water supply system, performance is measured by such factors as reliability of 
</p>
<p>supply, water quality, water pressure, frequency of burst water mains, sewer col-
</p>
<p>lapses, leaks and flooding, and response times and time to fix problems. Target 
</p>
<p>levels of service for these parameters are set and performance is measured against 
</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>499
</p>
<p>The severity of incidents can vary considerably and a severity rating should 
</p>
<p>be established. The rating will also serve to indicate priority in addressing prob-
</p>
<p>lems at any particular point in time. Examples of high severity events for a water 
</p>
<p>authority are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Sewer discharge or overflow
</p>
<p>&bull; Missing sewer access lid
</p>
<p>&bull; Sewage entering drain or watercourse
</p>
<p>&bull; Personal injury or significant health risk
</p>
<p>&bull; Damage to buildings or sensitive environments
</p>
<p>28.1.3  Electricity Transmission or Distribution
</p>
<p>Indicators of performance are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Outages frequency
</p>
<p>&bull; Outages duration
</p>
<p>&bull; System-minutes lost
</p>
<p>&bull; Voltage drops
</p>
<p>The system-minutes lost is calculated by dividing the number of megawatt-min-
</p>
<p>utes lost in a period by the average megawatt rating in the period. For example, if 
</p>
<p>40,000 megawatt-minutes were lost in a period, in a system that averaged 5,000 
</p>
<p>megawatts, the number of system-minutes lost would be 8.
</p>
<p>Outages can be split into those which are &ldquo;planned&rdquo; and those which are 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;unplanned&rdquo;. Planned outages occur when parts of the network are closed for 
</p>
<p>refurbishment, upgrading, or replacement and customers are warned in advance 
</p>
<p>of the intended shut down. The performance of the network is judged mainly on 
</p>
<p>keeping the extent of unplanned outages to a low level.
</p>
<p>28.1.4  Trucks
</p>
<p>Examples of indicators are,
</p>
<p>&bull; Truck utilization.
</p>
<p>&bull; Numbers of used and unused trucks.
</p>
<p>&bull; Payload by weight, volume, and value.
</p>
<p>&bull; Distance traveled.
</p>
<p>&bull; Value per truck-day.
</p>
<p>&bull; Comparison with a base line.
</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between maintenance indicators and operations 
</p>
<p>indicators.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>500 28 Performance, Audit, and Review
</p>
<p>28.2  Overall Equipment Effectiveness
</p>
<p>It is important to identify the sources of shortfalls. Availability may be high, but 
</p>
<p>utilization poor, due to a range of factors, such as shortage of operators, shortage 
</p>
<p>of materials, poor operational planning, and lack of demand. Similarly, the prob-
</p>
<p>lems may lie in the quality area.
</p>
<p>28.3  Maintenance-Related Performance Indicators
</p>
<p>The following are some examples of items which can be used as a basis for perfor-
</p>
<p>mance indicators.
</p>
<p> a. Plant availability to be high
</p>
<p> b. Maintenance backlog in terms of numbers of work orders and total work load.
</p>
<p> c. Budgetary performance, actual versus planned maintenance costs
</p>
<p> d. Compliance with weekly maintenance plan, % of activities completed
</p>
<p> e. Response to approved work requests by numbers and times.
</p>
<p> f. Planned and scheduled hours as a % of total maintenance hours.
</p>
<p> g. Regulatory conformance as audited
</p>
<p> h. Unplanned downtime to be low
</p>
<p> i. Occupational Safety and Health injuries to be minimal
</p>
<p> j.  Preventive Maintenance, Predictive Maintenance, and Condition-Based 
</p>
<p>Maintenance hours as a % of all maintenance hours to be high
</p>
<p> k. Breakdown Maintenance Hours as a % of All Maintenance Hours to be low
</p>
<p> l. Production losses due to maintenance to be low
</p>
<p> m. Maintenance costs as a % of turnover
</p>
<p> n. Maintenance costs as a % of plant replacement value
</p>
<p> o. Work Orders Reworked/Total Work Orders
</p>
<p> p. Maintenance overtime/Total company overtime to be less then 5 %
</p>
<p> q. Inventory service level, % items met from stock.
</p>
<p> r. Inventory turnover to be 2&ndash;3 times/year
</p>
<p> s. Training, proportion of employees/year receiving training to be more then 40 %
</p>
<p> t. Expenditure on employees training to be more than 4 % of payroll
</p>
<p> u. Store investment as a % of plant replacement value
</p>
<p> v. Contractor costs as a % of maintenance costs
</p>
<p> w. Maintenance labor utilization to be high, but not so high that response to 
</p>
<p>urgent jobs is inhibited.

<p>28.4  Audit of the Asset Management System3
</p>
<p>An audit is a process of checking a system to see whether the specified processes are 
</p>
<p>being correctly followed and that the records in the system reflect the real assets and 
</p>
<p>real events. Audits of the asset management system are required from time to time.
</p>
<p>The results from an audit should form a basis for correcting any errors, omis-
</p>
<p>sions, or nonconformities. They can also form a basis for improvements in the 
</p>
<p>system. Personnel working within the system should be encouraged to propose 
</p>
<p>potential improvements.
</p>
<p>Specific audit checks will include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Asset condition, availability, and suitability for purpose
</p>
<p>&bull; Compatibility of physical assets and the asset register
</p>
<p>&bull; Configuration management
</p>
<p>&bull; Stock taking
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk analysis and management status
</p>
<p>28.5  Management Review4
</p>
<p>A management review is a process of evaluating the asset management system to 
</p>
<p>check its suitability and effectiveness in relation to the aims of asset management. 
</p>
<p>Management reviews should be carried out from time to time.
</p>
<p>Reviews should consider whether changes are needed in the asset management 
</p>
<p>system, taking into account asset developments and the results of asset audits. 
</p>
<p>Developments can include changes in the numbers or types of assets supported, 
</p>
<p>technical and regulatory changes, and the performance of assets relative to key 
</p>
<p>indicators.
</p>
<p>Reviews may result in changes to resources, staffing, information systems, and 
</p>
<p>roles and responsibilities of personnel. Reports of reviews should be retained for 
</p>
<p>follow-up purposes.

<p>Abstract The aim of this chapter is to provide a guide to the ISO 55000 series 
</p>
<p>of Asset Management standards, published by the International Standards 
</p>
<p>Association. Outcomes Reading this chapter will provide information on the 
</p>
<p>requirements of the ISO 55000 series of standards and give cross-references to 
</p>
<p>the relevant sections in this book and in other publications. This will help you in 
</p>
<p>assessing, developing, and demonstrating the extent to which your organization 
</p>
<p>complies with the standard.
</p>
<p>29.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>ISO 55000 series standards are standards which describe and specify requirements 
</p>
<p>for the implementation of physical asset management in asset intensive organi-
</p>
<p>zations. This chapter provides a guide to the ISO 55000 series of standards. The 
</p>
<p>Global Forum on Maintenance and Asset Management (GFMAM) has a certifica-
</p>
<p>tion scheme under the standard. For more information on this please contact your 
</p>
<p>local asset management society, the web addresses of which are listed under web 
</p>
<p>references in the Bibliography at the end of this book.
</p>
<p>The ISO 55000 series of standards, like the ancient kingdom of Gaul, is divided 
</p>
<p>into three parts. The document references are:

<p>506 29 ISO 55000 Series Standards
</p>
<p>ISO 55001 contains a series of clauses which detail the requirements of the 
</p>
<p>standard. There are &ldquo;shall&rdquo; clauses, stating what an organization needs to do to 
</p>
<p>comply with the standard.
</p>
<p>ISO 55002 contains clauses with the same headings as in ISO 55001. Under 
</p>
<p>each heading it gives guidelines as to how the requirements of the corresponding 
</p>
<p>clause of ISO 55001 should be implemented.
</p>
<p>These standards provide a general framework for the management of physical 
</p>
<p>assets. The adoption of ISO 55000 can provide:
</p>
<p>&bull; A structured view and understanding of asset management;
</p>
<p>&bull; Effective relationships between top management, asset management, operations, 
</p>
<p>and maintenance;
</p>
<p>&bull; Improvements in asset financial returns;
</p>
<p>&bull; Well-informed asset management decisions;
</p>
<p>&bull; Insurance, health and safety, regulatory, and risk management benefits;
</p>
<p>&bull; Company recognition/marketing; and 
</p>
<p>&bull; Improvements in training and development.
</p>
<p>The ISO 5500 standards do not provide the specific detail of the many techniques 
</p>
<p>involved in asset management. Besides knowing which techniques are relevant to any 
</p>
<p>clause, we need the detail of that technique. This book, and the references and stand-
</p>
<p>ards listed at the end of this book, present details of asset management techniques 
</p>
<p>and procedures needed to implement an ISO 55000-based asset management system.
</p>
<p>29.1.1  ISO 55000 Fundamentals
</p>
<p>ISO 55000 lists the fundamentals on which asset management is based. These 
</p>
<p>include an alignment between organizational and asset management objectives, 
</p>
<p>the use of a lifecycle management approach, awareness of stakeholder needs, 
</p>
<p>the use of a risk-based approach to decision making, and the integration of asset 
</p>
<p>management with related functions including finance, human resources, logis-
</p>
<p>tics, operations, and information systems. Leadership and the definition of roles 
</p>
<p>and responsibilities are emphasized. Key topics are planning, support, operations, 
</p>
<p> performance evaluation, and continuous improvement.

</p>
<p>application of an asset management system based on ISO 55001. The clause head-
</p>
<p>ings in ISO 55001 and ISO 55002 are the same, so that each clause in ISO 55002 
</p>
<p>gives information about the implementation of the corresponding clause in ISO

<p>55001. The clauses are considered in detail in the next section.
</p>
<p>29.2  ISO 55001 Clauses and Book Cross-References
</p>
<p>The requirements of the standard are indicated in ISO 55001. This section lists 
</p>
<p>the clauses in ISO 55001, and for each one I quote a short extract in italics which 
</p>
<p>indicates the primary intent of the clause. References are then given to sections of 
</p>
<p>this book, and other documents or techniques, which can provide information to 
</p>
<p>assist in meeting the requirements of the standard. Application guidelines are also 
</p>
<p>provided in ISO 55002 under the same clause numbers.

<p>29.4  Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP)
</p>
<p>ISO 55001 at Clause 4.4 states that:
</p>
<p>The organization shall develop a Strategic Asset Management Plan&hellip;
</p>
<p>ISO 55000 at Clause 3.3.2 defines a Strategic Asset Management Plan, as follows:
</p>
<p>Documented information that specifies how organizational objectives are to be converted 
into asset management objectives, the approach for developing asset management plans, 
and the role of the asset management system in supporting the achievement of asset man-
agement objectives.
</p>
<p>The SAMP forms a basis for documenting compliance with ISO  55000.
</p>
<p>&bull; Indicates the organizational systems which address the requirements of the ISO 
</p>
<p>55000 standard.
</p>
<p>&bull; For accreditation under the standard, the clauses in the standard should be 
</p>
<p>demonstrably addressed in practice. The process will be assisted if the SAMP 
</p>
<p>follows the structure of the standard.
</p>
<p>As a &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; document, the SAMP will normally refer to more detailed docu-
</p>
<p>ments in specific areas, rather than containing all the information itself. However, 
</p>
<p>it should provide an adequate indication of where the necessary features are 
</p>
<p>detailed.
</p>
<p>Note that ISO 55000, Clause 3.3.2 defines the SAMP is in a way which entirely 
</p>
<p>different from its definition of &ldquo;asset management plan&rdquo; which is given in ISO 
</p>
<p>55000, Clause 3.3.3. Asset management plans in the definition of Clause 3.3.3 are 
</p>
<p>considered in Chapter 9. The SAMP contains &ldquo;how to&rdquo; information on the asset 
</p>
<p>management processes as a whole. However, the extent to which the SAMP and 
</p>
<p>Asset Management Plans have material in common, or are merged or linked into a 
</p>
<p>single document, is at the discretion of the organization.

<p>29.6  Functional Gap Analysis
</p>
<p>An organization can check its status in relation to the standard, by comparing its 
</p>
<p>systems with those indicated by the clauses of ISO 55001. The organization is 
</p>
<p>likely to have in place many of the wide range of systems and techniques in recog-
</p>
<p>nized use for physical asset management. The aim of this table is to assist compa-
</p>
<p>nies to assess their competence in relation to ISO 55001.
</p>
<p>In Table 29.2, the first column gives the ISO 55001 clause numbers and clause 
</p>
<p>heading, and the second column gives a brief description. As an example, consider

<p>Clause 7.5 Information Requirements. The requirement for an asset management 
</p>
<p>information system will typically be met by having a computerized asset manage-
</p>
<p>ment information system. Thus Table 29.2 shows &ldquo;asset information management 
</p>
<p>system in operation&rdquo; as the first listed requirement relevant to this clause. The three 
</p>
<p>right-hand columns of the table provide for the user to assess the level of compe-
</p>
<p>tency targeted and achieved, and whether the targeted level has been attained.

</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s level of competency in relation to any clause is judged by ref-
</p>
<p>erence to five levels which are listed at the end of Table 29.2. These are Mastery 
</p>
<p>(score 5), Professional (4), Foundation (3), Developing (2), Initial (1), and None 
</p>
<p>(0). The fourth column in Table 29.2, headed Target, is for the user to select a 
</p>
<p>target level which the company wishes to achieve in relation to a particular tech-
</p>
<p>nique. While Mastery (5) would be ideal for every competency, not all companies 
</p>
<p>will require the same level of competency in every technique or every clause.
</p>
<p>As an example, again consider clause 7.5 Information Requirements. The sec-
</p>
<p>ond competency under this clause is &ldquo;Resourcing.&rdquo; The target set by the company 
</p>
<p>for this competency might be Professional (4), that is, we wish to have adequate, 
</p>
<p>well-trained, and professionally competent staff to support our asset management 
</p>
<p>information system. If the company has in fact minimal resources in this area, pos-
</p>
<p>sibly also with system training yet to be completed, then its actual level of attain-
</p>
<p>ment might be assessed as Initial (1) or Developing (2). The Attained column 
</p>
<p>would then contain the entry &ldquo;0&rdquo; since the target level of competence has not been 
</p>
<p>reached.
</p>
<p>Assessment of the company&rsquo;s competence in relation to the target levels can be 
</p>
<p>continued across all clauses of ISO 55001, with Actual and Attained levels being 
</p>
<p>entered in the Table. Finally, a total score can be calculated in terms of both per-
</p>
<p>centage of Actual to Target and of the number of competencies attained.
