<p>Foreword by Doug Baillie
</p>
<p>This book provides an excellent framework for managers to pursue sustainable busi-
</p>
<p>ness in a strategic way. At the same time, it is a learning model, starting with the 
</p>
<p>foundations of risk management and stakeholder management and moving on to the 
</p>
<p>more complex challenges of strategic differentiation and business model innova-
</p>
<p>tion. The most challenging part however is the organizational change management 
</p>
<p>and talent development which needs to follow or go hand in hand with the strategic 
</p>
<p>processes.
</p>
<p>The wealth of case studies and supporting texts is derived from the legacy of 
</p>
<p>ABIS&nbsp;&ndash; The Academy of Business in Society where business schools and compa-
</p>
<p>nies are working together to enhance the knowledge base for sustainable business. 
</p>
<p>The book follows the rationale of the business manager in a very practical manner, 
</p>
<p>and I hope it will be widely used in executive education and become a core part of 
</p>
<p>learning and talent development.

<p>Foreword by Daniel Janssen
</p>
<p>Before I joined Solvay S.A., I was the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, the chair-
</p>
<p>man of the Belgian Employers Association and one of the hundred founders of the 
</p>
<p>Club of Rome in 1968. I was convinced of the necessity of sustainability whether 
</p>
<p>environmental, social or ethical.
</p>
<p>During my stay at the helm of Solvay S.A. (1984&ndash;2006), our global company 
</p>
<p>became even more global and even more conscious of the rising global sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity challenges. As a 150-year-old family-controlled company, we understood very 
</p>
<p>well what sustainability meant. My management colleagues and I, with the support 
</p>
<p>of my family shareholders, decided increasingly to take strategic decisions and 
</p>
<p>operational execution only when we could grow profitably in a sustainable way, 
</p>
<p>with due respect for environmental, social and ethical issues. With these principles 
</p>
<p>in mind, we have reorganized some businesses, we have sold businesses where we 
</p>
<p>could no longer see profitable growth with sustainability, and we have acquired 
</p>
<p>businesses where we could see growth with sustainable profitability.
</p>
<p>This book offers managers a systematic approach for pursuing sustainable profit-
</p>
<p>ability by integrating economic, social, environmental and ethical dimensions in 
</p>
<p>business strategy and decision-making. As a member of the INSEAD Advisory 
</p>
<p>Council, I have argued for a long time that the future of capitalism is in peril if&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>despite its global and remarkable successes&nbsp;&ndash; business cannot control and minimize 
</p>
<p>its failures and excesses (greed, inequality, corruption, climate change, social injus-
</p>
<p>tice, etc.). The solution must be a more sustainable market economy. I am convinced 
</p>
<p>that businesses, when profitable, sustainable and innovative, are a force for good, 
</p>
<p>for a better world. I think therefore that the business schools curriculum should 
</p>
<p>address the sustainability challenges in serious ways. I am very happy to see that 
</p>
<p>this book offers a down-to-earth framework for making this happen. I congratulate 
</p>
<p>the editors and the authors for their unique contribution to business education.

</p>
<p>Managing Sustainable Business in a Global 
Context
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are presenting an outline of the conceptual framework for this 
</p>
<p>book. This framework is also a step-by-step model for managers to identify risks 
</p>
<p>and opportunities for sustainable business and therefore also a managerial frame-
</p>
<p>work for decision making, as well as a supervisory framework for the board.
</p>
<p>As set out in the introductory chapter, the key to sustainable business is in achiev-
</p>
<p>ing the right balance between managing competitiveness and profitability for attrac-
</p>
<p>tive returns to shareholders with managing the political, social and ecological 
</p>
<p>context of the business which in turn can enhance competitiveness and profitability. 
</p>
<p>Managing the context of the business is focused on both protecting value against 
</p>
<p>sustainability risks and creating new value from sustainability opportunities. In 
</p>
<p>managing context, the business is perceived as generating benefits for all stakehold-
</p>
<p>ers (including its shareholders) and as a credible and trustworthy player for these 
</p>
<p>stakeholders.
</p>
<p>Sustainable business is achieved by integrating context issues into the business 
</p>
<p>model and competitive strategy, laying the foundations for long-term profitable 
</p>
<p>growth. The model we propose is designed in six steps which are the six modules of 
</p>
<p>the book:
</p>
<p> 1. Risk Management focusses on the &ldquo;accountabilities&rdquo; of the business and consists 
</p>
<p>of knowledge management of &ldquo;inside-out&rdquo; impacts of the business model and 
</p>
<p>the business strategy. Risk management is about managing accountabilities for 
</p>
<p>impacts (externalities) in shifting social contract environments. Oil companies 
</p>
<p>like Shell and BP are held accountable for all environmental impacts, even if 
</p>
<p>they operate within the law and governmental regulation (Shell) or if the impacts 
</p>
<p>have been caused by a subcontractor (BP).
</p>
<p> 2. Issues Management focusses on the more vague &ldquo;responsibilities&rdquo; of the busi-
</p>
<p>ness and consists of knowledge management of &ldquo;outside-in&rdquo; impacts of new 
</p>
<p>issues from the business environment on the business. Issues management is 
</p>
<p>about adopting appropriate organisational responses for latent, emerging and 
</p>
<p>maturing issues of responsibility. In the face of controversy on child labour, Nike 
</p>
<p>had to shift from a defensive and compliance approach to a strategic approach by 
</p>
<p>changing its business model and seeking industry sector agreements as the child 
</p>
<p>labour issue matured over the years.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xiv
</p>
<p> 3. Stakeholder Management for Competitiveness and Trust is about identifying, 
</p>
<p>weighing the importance and prioritisation of key stakeholders within the busi-
</p>
<p>ness model and managing relationships with stakeholders as key resources for 
</p>
<p>comparative strategic advantage. Companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson invest con-
</p>
<p>tinuously in relations with key stakeholders such as hospital managers and health 
</p>
<p>care staff.
</p>
<p> 4. Strategic Differentiation: Strategic Bets for Sustainable Business Development 
</p>
<p>is about developing sustainability value propositions to markets and stakehold-
</p>
<p>ers, including reconceiving products and services, redefining productivity in the 
</p>
<p>value chain and developing partnerships. GE Healthcare high efficiency CT sys-
</p>
<p>tems are designed to reduce electricity consumption for operation and ambient 
</p>
<p>cooling by optimising energy use based on a customer&rsquo;s usage profile. Illycaff&egrave; 
</p>
<p>redefined productivity in the value chain by engaging directly with farmers to 
</p>
<p>ensure high-quality supplies combined with a better income for farmers. GSK 
</p>
<p>formed partnerships with NGOs to ensure that medicines would find their way to 
</p>
<p>patients instead of disappearing into corrupt reselling channels.
</p>
<p> 5. Business Model Innovations and Transformations: Taking Great Leaps Forward 
</p>
<p>is about identifying and entering market spaces with high sustainable value and 
</p>
<p>transforming business models and capabilities to capitalise on emerging market 
</p>
<p>value. Umicore reinvented itself from a polluting steel giant into a specialty met-
</p>
<p>als and materials producer and technology solutions for sustainable develop-
</p>
<p>ment. IBM radically changed its business model from a hardware producer of 
</p>
<p>PCs and servers to a provider of IT-driven solutions for sustainable development 
</p>
<p>in, for example, electricity grid efficiency and traffic management.
</p>
<p> 6. Managing Change for Sustainable Business: Developing Dynamic Capabilities 
</p>
<p>is about developing organisational capabilities and managerial talent for sustain-
</p>
<p>able business and leadership for organisational change. All the above cited exam-
</p>
<p>ples of innovative companies display a dynamic capability for turning 
</p>
<p>sustainability threats into opportunities. Unilever does so in an exemplary way 
</p>
<p>with its Sustainable Living Plan and is completely redesigning HR and talent 
</p>
<p>development processes to support its strategic ambition of doubling sales and 
</p>
<p>halving environmental impact.
</p>
<p>We will now elaborate on this model by providing the conceptual background 
</p>
<p>and analysis for each of these six dimensons of managing sustainable business.
</p>
<p> Part I Risk Management: Managing the&nbsp;Accountabilities 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Business
</p>
<p>This first level of analysis deals with the accountabilities for inside-out impacts (or 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;externalities&rdquo;) of the company on its ecological, social and governance/political 
</p>
<p>environment (ESG). Most companies have considerable positive impacts in terms 
</p>
<p>Managing Sustainable Business in a Global Context</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xv
</p>
<p>of technological development, quality products and services, employment, tax con-
</p>
<p>tributions, training of the workforce (which contributes to its employability), com-
</p>
<p>munity support, philanthropic activities and more. However, within the context of 
</p>
<p>managing the company&rsquo;s accountabilities, it is important to manage the risks asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with negative impacts, i.e. costs which are externalised and from which the 
</p>
<p>company profits but the price to be paid in extreme cases might be prohibitive.
</p>
<p>Negative impacts may be oil spills, air and water pollution (environment), poor 
</p>
<p>and unsafe working conditions, human rights violations (social), corruption, entan-
</p>
<p>glements in civil wars and complicity with governments which do not respect 
</p>
<p>human rights or free speech (governance). However, a business will always have 
</p>
<p>externalities, some with acceptable costs for society. How much costs are accept-
</p>
<p>able to society is very much dependent on the normative context of the company 
</p>
<p>often described as the &ldquo;social contract&rdquo; a company operates with.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;social contract&rdquo; in this context of sustainable business refers to the normative 
</p>
<p>framework the business operates with, which is determined by the expectations of 
</p>
<p>society and government on the role and purpose of business1. These expectations go 
</p>
<p>well beyond fulfilling legal and regulatory obligations by business.
</p>
<p>The normative framework consists of both explicit and implicit expectations of 
</p>
<p>governments and societies (often voiced via non-governmental organisations).
</p>
<p>In our model, risk management deals with management of impacts within the 
</p>
<p>context of the social contract of explicit expectations.
</p>
<p>The informal, implicit and frontier expectations of the social contract are the 
</p>
<p>subject of issues management. These so-called norms consist of the explicit and 
</p>
<p>implicit expectations of governments and societies (often voiced via non- 
</p>
<p>governmental organisations). In our model, risk management deals with manage-
</p>
<p>ment of impacts within the context of the social contract of explicit expectations. 
</p>
<p>The informal, implicit and frontier expectations of the social contract are the subject 
</p>
<p>of issues management.
</p>
<p>Explicit expectations in relation to impact management can be legal or extrale-
</p>
<p>gal. Legal standards on social, environmental and financial accountabilities are pro-
</p>
<p>vided by legislations of governments, directives of supranational bodies like the EU 
</p>
<p>or supranational institutions like the WTO.&nbsp; Extralegal explicit expectations are 
</p>
<p>shaped by guidelines from organisations like OECD, ILO, UNEP and UN Global 
</p>
<p>Compact, covenants with governments or even strong demands from credible NGOs 
</p>
<p>supported by public opinion.
</p>
<p>Explicit expectations might vary from country to country and between conti-
</p>
<p>nents, but with the emergence of the &ldquo;global village&rdquo;, corporate activities which are 
</p>
<p>in line with explicit expectations in one part of the world may be judged by the court 
</p>
<p>of global public opinion and media from another more stringent set of criteria.

</p>
<p>Risks are mostly inherent in the externalities of the business model and the busi-
</p>
<p>ness strategy and thus are at the heart of the company&rsquo;s existence. These exposures 
</p>
<p>of the business model and business strategy can be life-threatening to any 
</p>
<p>business.
</p>
<p>Risk management is implemented by:
</p>
<p> &ndash; Identifying negative impacts against the background of explicit expectations
</p>
<p> &ndash; Understanding the liabilities and possible consequences (financial and 
</p>
<p>reputational)
</p>
<p> &ndash; Setting and continuously updating standards
</p>
<p> &ndash; Managing compliance, assurance and control processes
</p>
<p> &ndash; Crisis and response management (despite all of the above, something can/will go 
</p>
<p>wrong)
</p>
<p> &ndash; Communications management, transparency and media management
</p>
<p>Business models consist of different parts and each part can carry specific risks. 
</p>
<p>Typically, a business model defines the way the business creates, delivers and cap-
</p>
<p>tures value. It consists of different parts (Al-Debei and Avison, 2010):
</p>
<p> &ndash; The value proposition, i.e. the value created for customers (price, quality, 
</p>
<p>service)
</p>
<p> &ndash; The market segment and types of customers (sensitivity, political)
</p>
<p> &ndash; The structure and span of the value chain from suppliers to customers
</p>
<p> &ndash; The revenue-generating processes and systems (pricing, margin setting, exploita-
</p>
<p>tion of quasi-monopolistic positions)
</p>
<p> &ndash; The position of the business in the value network or the &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; it forms part 
</p>
<p>of, i.e. the vertically and horizontally extended value chain and relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders
</p>
<p>Consequently business models with different foci have different risks. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, business models based on low cost and price leadership (e.g. Walmart, 
</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s and FedEx) are vulnerable in different ways compared to business 
</p>
<p>models based on product leadership (e.g. Apple, Fidelity Investments, BMW and 
</p>
<p>Pfizer), where the brand value is more at stake. Also different strategies have spe-
</p>
<p>cific risks: Geographical expansion and new market development, for example, 
</p>
<p>maybe risky, since companies start operating in new territories with unknown com-
</p>
<p>plexities in the social contract fabric and the political context, e.g. BP in Columbia, 
</p>
<p>Google in China, Walmart in Mexico, Shell in Russia and GSK in South Africa.
</p>
<p>Manifest risks can be analysed in terms of their type (like environmental, 
</p>
<p>social, governance/political risks) and the degree which can be evaluated in a 
</p>
<p>matrix of control and repercussions. The areas of risks are defined by the spans of 
</p>
<p>Managing Sustainable Business in a Global Context</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xvii
</p>
<p>vertical and horizontal integration in the value chains and may be located in the sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain, in the distribution chain (including product liabilities), in production 
</p>
<p>facilities, in joint ventures, in mergers and acquisitions (hence importance of ESG 
</p>
<p>due diligence) and in geographic and associated cultural risks in new markets.
</p>
<p>Negative effects may be a combination of financial losses through costs, fines, 
</p>
<p>litigation, share price erosion, market share losses, damage to reputation which 
</p>
<p>increases transaction costs, diminished brand value which depresses margins and 
</p>
<p>thus profitability, valuable management time spent on managing crises and the 
</p>
<p>aftermaths instead of growing the business.
</p>
<p>Underlying risks may be:
</p>
<p>&bull; Managerial risks like a too narrow short-term focus, ignorance of context of 
</p>
<p>business, underestimating inherent risks in the business model and business 
</p>
<p>strategies, legalism and defensiveness (or lack of proactive attitude) of 
</p>
<p>management
</p>
<p>&bull; Organisational risks in organisational culture and structure, processes, systems 
</p>
<p>and skills, top management driving challenging targets &ldquo;whatever the costs&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>middle management taking unsustainable pathways (e.g. Volkswagen emissions 
</p>
<p>scandal)
</p>
<p>&bull; Corporate governance risks caused by boards not sufficiently overseeing a 
</p>
<p>broad spectrum of risks in the business and the context of business and boards 
</p>
<p>not questioning basic assumptions in business models and strategies and not 
</p>
<p>critically questioning risk/return imbalances
</p>
<p>Boards should be closely involved in overseeing risk management beyond the 
</p>
<p>traditional concerns of financial and technical risks. This is not in the least because 
</p>
<p>regulatory risks (governments imposing new legislation with costs of administra-
</p>
<p>tion for companies and which might, in addition, not be effective) need to be miti-
</p>
<p>gated by substantial voluntary industry sector-wide standards and practices. In order 
</p>
<p>to achieve this, companies may want to assume industry sector leadership and/or 
</p>
<p>establish market entry barriers for low-quality unsustainable operators. This may be 
</p>
<p>tricky.
</p>
<p>A newly emerging dimension of risk management is the growing integration of 
</p>
<p>sustainability risks into equity research by asset managers and fund managers 
</p>
<p>and the potential of future share value being risk adjusted accordingly. Boards 
</p>
<p>should be alert to this new trend. (See the introduction in Chap. 2).
</p>
<p>Boards should also seek assurances that risk management and crisis manage-
</p>
<p>ment capabilities are adequately provided for since total risk control at all times is 
</p>
<p>not possible.

</p>
<p> Part II Issues Management: Managing the&nbsp;&ldquo;Responsibilities&rdquo; 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Business
</p>
<p>The second element of the model is an outside-in investigation of major trends in 
</p>
<p>the immediate and wider business environment which may affect the business in the 
</p>
<p>medium to long term. These trends produce issues that exacerbate risks in the 
</p>
<p>business model and the business strategy or create new risks, thereby affecting 
</p>
<p>the sustainability of the business model and strategy.
</p>
<p>Issues management is concerned with the less formal, more implicit or even 
</p>
<p>frontier expectations within social contracts. Issues management is therefore 
</p>
<p>more fluid, much less predictable and more a matter of connectedness and feeling 
</p>
<p>for context, judgement and opportunity assessment than straightforward analysis, 
</p>
<p>standard setting and compliance management.

</p>
<p>Major current issues such as a culture of systematic corruption, inequality, pov-
</p>
<p>erty, privacy, obesity, offshoring, access to medicines, resource depletion, forest 
</p>
<p>destruction and climate change were not long ago widely considered to be part of 
</p>
<p>the responsibilities of governments and regulators and not the responsibility of 
</p>
<p>business. As these issues over time emerged, matured and became publicly associ-
</p>
<p>ated with corporate responsibility, they have shifted an industry&rsquo;s ground rules and 
</p>
<p>pose serious threats to the sustainability of the business.
</p>
<p>However, these issues can create new market opportunities that nimble compa-
</p>
<p>nies can identify and exploit for comparative advantage. Of course, there are first- 
</p>
<p>mover business risks involved in incorporating emerging issues very early on in 
</p>
<p>business models and strategies ahead of the competition, such as cost disadvan-
</p>
<p>tages. Thus, companies with a business model based on cost leadership and stan-
</p>
<p>dardisation will be less keen. However, agile companies will nevertheless consider 
</p>
<p>simultaneously the risks associated with lagging behind and becoming an icon of 
</p>
<p>corporate irresponsibility and greed. Industry leaders are especially prone to becom-
</p>
<p>ing these icons.
</p>
<p>Issues management deals with the continuously shifting grounds of what is 
</p>
<p>perceived as the responsibilities of business by public opinion at large and spe-
</p>
<p>cific stakeholders in particular. Issues management deals with the informal, 
</p>
<p>implicit and frontier expectations of the social contract.
</p>
<p>If issues are latent, like obesity or water depletion 15&nbsp;years ago, a defensive atti-
</p>
<p>tude (&ldquo;business cannot solve these problems, governments should&rdquo;) may not be 
</p>
<p>damaging but alertness to the shifting grounds of perception may be necessary nev-
</p>
<p>ertheless. As issues emerge, positions need to be taken deliberately and managerial 
</p>
<p>action is often required. At this stage, CSR departments are often tasked with com-
</p>
<p>pliance management, but this may not be sufficient. As Zadek describes in the 
</p>
<p>Nike case, the issue of child labour was a type of collateral damage, an indirect 
</p>
<p>effect of the business model, based on just in time supply policies and the remunera-
</p>
<p>tion policies for procurement staff. Imposing standards on suppliers by compliance 
</p>
<p>officers sent by the CSR department was to no avail at first. Instead, the business 
</p>
<p>model needed to be adapted. Corruption was long considered an unavoidable part of 
</p>
<p>doing business, especially in developing markets. Corruption remains a challenging 
</p>
<p>issue for companies and requires more than compliance management. Companies 
</p>
<p>like Siemens learned the hard way that corrupt practices can be implicitly part of the 
</p>
<p>business culture and business strategy and a significant overhaul of both is often 
</p>
<p>required.
</p>
<p>Issues might be linked to industry structures or even global trade conditions 
</p>
<p>and again require much more exhaustive analysis and deliberate strategic action 
</p>
<p>than compliance management by CSR departments. They require immediate and 
</p>
<p>strong involvement of senior management and the board. In Nike&rsquo;s case, a global 
</p>
<p>trade agreement within the WTO provided for supply quota per country in the global 
</p>
<p>apparel industry. This well-intended policy (equal access to world markets) had 
</p>
<p>Managing Sustainable Business in a Global Context</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xx
</p>
<p>however unintended side effects which indirectly allowed child labour to persist. 
</p>
<p>Companies like Nike had thousands of suppliers from many countries and found it 
</p>
<p>impossible to control standards in the supply chain and concentrate on quality rela-
</p>
<p>tions with fewer suppliers. Cooperation between the industry sector and the WTO 
</p>
<p>was required to adapt trade agreements and avoid unintended consequences. Nike 
</p>
<p>assumed industry leadership to help significantly in making this happen.
</p>
<p>Companies like Walmart, McDonald&rsquo;s and Lidl enjoy low-cost supply conditions 
</p>
<p>but have low margins in sales and distribution. Apparel brands such as Nike have of 
</p>
<p>course a much more profitable business model, which is based on low cost in the 
</p>
<p>supply chain and high margins in the sales and distribution chain. Returns, certainly 
</p>
<p>without any investment in manufacturing and other assets, can be extraordinary. 
</p>
<p>However, the rule often holds that considerably higher returns bear significant risks.
</p>
<p>Many more companies, such as Apple, source from low-cost countries and sell at 
</p>
<p>high brand premiums in developed markets. But such business models become 
</p>
<p>threatened over time from both ends by emerging issues: the cost basis on the sup-
</p>
<p>ply end and the brand damage which may erode margins at the distribution and 
</p>
<p>marketing end.
</p>
<p>The emerging and maturing issues of today are without a doubt climate change 
</p>
<p>(especially since the COP21 Summit in December 2015) and environmental foot-
</p>
<p>prints in general, along with related issues such as erosion of water reserves, emis-
</p>
<p>sions testing and performance of automobiles. But other issues are also seemingly 
</p>
<p>maturing, like inequality in general, access to medicines, corporate tax avoidance 
</p>
<p>and tax competition between countries from which companies benefit, fugitives and 
</p>
<p>migration and programmed obsolescence of electrical and electronic products. 
</p>
<p>Executives might be tempted to be dismissive of corporate responsibility in these or 
</p>
<p>only accept a small part of responsibility, but the bets are out on how long this 
</p>
<p>defensive attitude can last and when it results in a &ldquo;too little, too late&rdquo; blame in the 
</p>
<p>medium term or even short term.
</p>
<p>Simon Zadek proposes an excellent model for use in the executive education 
</p>
<p>classroom, which links issue maturity to the appropriate organisational response 
</p>
<p>(see Zadek&rsquo;s chapter on Organisational Learning). Using the case of Nike in the 
</p>
<p>1990s, Zadek describes how companies go through an individual learning process 
</p>
<p>and others can learn from its experience. He states that &ldquo;Companies don&rsquo;t become 
</p>
<p>model citizens overnight. Nike&rsquo;s metamorphosis from the poster child for irrespon-
</p>
<p>sibility to a leader in progressive practices reveals the five stages of organisational 
</p>
<p>growth&rdquo;. Nike&rsquo;s business model of producing high-end consumer products in low- 
</p>
<p>cost countries and selling in high-price markets is similar to that of many other 
</p>
<p>companies. But under the pressure of activists, the company was forced to act. 
</p>
<p>Zadek introduces five discernible stages of how companies handle corporate respon-
</p>
<p>sibility, relative to issue maturity. This is illustrated in the figure below and dis-
</p>
<p>cussed in detail in the chapter.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Part III Stakeholder Management: Managing Competitiveness 
and&nbsp;Trust
</p>
<p>Business stakeholders are affected by the business while they also have an effect on 
</p>
<p>it. The stakeholder view of the corporation allows for a clear view on all those 
</p>
<p>groups and organisations with which the business is interdependent and which 
</p>
<p>need to be closely monitored during management processes to provide checks and 
</p>
<p>balances. The stakeholder view we introduce here is not opposed to a &ldquo;shareholder 
</p>
<p>view&rdquo;. Shareholders, investors at large, are also stakeholders themselves, albeit that 
</p>
<p>they exert considerable powers via the financial markets and based on corporate law. 
</p>
<p>But the considerable powers of other stakeholders work in different ways, often 
</p>
<p>indirect and on different timescales. Moreover, stakeholders may be perceived as 
</p>
<p>pulling the business in different directions, maybe ultimately tearing it apart and 
</p>
<p>destroying it. The task of management is to counteract the competing forces 
</p>
<p>around common purpose and common interest. At times, trade-offs and compro-
</p>
<p>mises need to be made, but more value can be created by finding new innovative 
</p>
<p>solutions, new creative approaches that can go beyond pedestrian compromise.
</p>
<p>The resource-based approach to business strategy considers all stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>be sources of information and knowledge which can be key in gaining comparative 
</p>
<p>advantage (Post, Preston &amp; Sachs 2004). The entire relational capital with stake-
</p>
<p>holders can be leveraged for advantage. Furthermore, the capability to manage this 
</p>
<p>and achieve binding purpose with stakeholders is a key element of the set of 
</p>
<p>capabilities that constitute comparative advantage. This model distinguishes 
</p>
<p>three types of stakeholders:
</p>
<p>Managing Sustainable Business in a Global Context</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xxii
</p>
<p>Resource base stakeholders such as investors, customers and employees.
</p>
<p>Industry structure stakeholders such as suppliers, unions, joint venture partners and 
</p>
<p>regulatory bodies. Even competitors can be seen as part of this group of 
</p>
<p>stakeholders.
</p>
<p>Social-institutional stakeholders such as governments, non-governmental organisa-
</p>
<p>tions (NGOs), other civil society organisations and local communities.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The media including the press, TV, radio, Internet and social networks are giving 
</p>
<p>voice to stakeholders but act sometimes as stakeholders in their own right. However, 
</p>
<p>stakeholders can be sources of both risk and opportunity. A stakeholder man-
</p>
<p>agement model of the business should distinguish between risk and opportunities 
</p>
<p>with each stakeholder and manage these accordingly. Stakeholder management cre-
</p>
<p>ates firm value by minimising risk and maximising opportunity in relationships with 
</p>
<p>stakeholders.
</p>
<p>Risks and opportunities provided by stakeholders may vary, and accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, different weightings of stakeholders should be undertaken. In knowledge- 
</p>
<p>based industries, human resources carry more risks and opportunities compared to 
</p>
<p>physical asset-based companies like oil companies, who in turn need to attach more 
</p>
<p>risks to environmental activists and regulators. All stakeholders are important, but 
</p>
<p>some more than others, depending on the industry sector and the specific business 
</p>
<p>model and business strategy of the company.
</p>
<p>Stakeholders of particular high risk but also of potential high opportunity are 
</p>
<p>NGOs. Since the early 1990s, NGOs have been challenging companies more openly 
</p>
<p>Managing Sustainable Business in a Global Context</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xxiii
</p>
<p>for taking on their responsibilities towards society. This is particularly risky for 
</p>
<p>companies with a home market in Europe and North America, with strong brand 
</p>
<p>equity, scale and standardisation and with industry leadership status. According to 
</p>
<p>Elkington and Fennel (1998), NGOs can have four roles in this regard (sharks, 
</p>
<p>orcas, sea lions and dolphins) and each requires different risk-minimising and 
</p>
<p>opportunity-enhancing strategies. Sharks and orcas tend to be confrontational and 
</p>
<p>tend to polarise and act more (sharks) or less (orcas) by instinct and in groups. 
</p>
<p>NGOs like Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Human Rights Watch would fall 
</p>
<p>into these categories. Sea lions and dolphins on the other side are much more 
</p>
<p>inclined towards co-operation. While sea lions would accept funding from compa-
</p>
<p>nies and tend not to be very critical, dolphins see their independence as essential in 
</p>
<p>a co-operation. NGOs like Oxfam, Caritas, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Amnesty 
</p>
<p>International and Save the Children can be fit into these categories. Many NGOs 
</p>
<p>start out as sharks with confronting campaigns and as much distance from compa-
</p>
<p>nies as possible. It is of high importance for companies to manage the different roles 
</p>
<p>of NGOs carefully to mitigate the risk but also find opportunities to collaborate.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In sum, stakeholder management is a vital part of managing a sustainable busi-
</p>
<p>ness. This is also recognised by sustainable asset managers and, increasingly, main-
</p>
<p>stream asset and fund managers in the financial services industry, who evaluate each 
</p>
<p>company on risks and opportunities both in the business exposure to sustainability 
</p>
<p>trends and in stakeholder relationships. This is commercially sensitive information 
</p>
<p>which is not published. But the authors of this chapter have been deeply involved in 
</p>
<p>the development of such assessment models for asset management firms. In these 
</p>
<p>models, the quality of stakeholder relationships is an important part of the assess-
</p>
<p>ment and makes up for 50% of the assessment rating.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of such a model.
 
</p>
<p>Managing Sustainable Business in a Global Context</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xxiv
</p>
<p>Stakeholder management provides the method and channels for encom-
</p>
<p>passing Risk Management (Part I) and Issues Management (Part II). Risks and 
</p>
<p>issues are better managed with a smart and credible stakeholder strategy and 
</p>
<p>implementation.
</p>
<p>Leading companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novartis, Orange, IKEA, BMW 
</p>
<p>and many more have implemented stakeholder-based business principles. These 
</p>
<p>companies define risks and opportunities with each stakeholder and develop and 
</p>
<p>evaluate key performance indicators and expectations from relationships with each 
</p>
<p>stakeholder. They consistently build knowledge resources and social capital. They 
</p>
<p>are keenly aware of risks from impacts/externalities and of emerging issues and 
</p>
<p>proactively manage these with stakeholders. Stakeholder management becomes in 
</p>
<p>this way the management model of the business.
</p>
<p>In the past, some companies bought into a very different narrative, the so-called 
</p>
<p>shareholder value model, which became fashionable in the mid-1990s. Today, the 
</p>
<p>consequences of this are still being felt, not least since the banking crisis of 2008. 
</p>
<p>The practices that were inspired by this model paradoxically but not surprisingly 
</p>
<p>destroyed shareholder value on a massive scale. Already in 2004, John Kay, then 
</p>
<p>dean of Oxford University&rsquo;s Said Business School, predicted:
</p>
<p>The financial pre-occupation of many companies have rather eroded, not enhanced com-
</p>
<p>petitive advantage. It diverts management attention from sustainable value creation. The 
</p>
<p>Shareholder Model, solely focussed on profit maximisation and share performance, is typi-

<p>be risk adjusted downwards.

<p>cally not successful, even on its own terms and has undermined the legitimacy and stability 
</p>
<p>of the market economy. It will end up destroying the very shareholder value it proclaims to 
</p>
<p>defend and grow.2
</p>
<p>And so, unfortunately, it happened as predicted by John Kay with companies like 
</p>
<p>Daimler Benz, Marks &amp; Spencer, Vodafone and others. Shareholders, customers, 
</p>
<p>staff, suppliers and other stakeholders paid dearly for the aberration Kay denounced 
</p>
<p>in a radical way as &ldquo;unfit for wealth creation in free markets&rdquo;. It took these compa-
</p>
<p>nies often more than a decade to turn themselves around with new management, 
</p>
<p>renewed business purpose and renewed attention to value creation with stakeholders 
</p>
<p>and ultimately for shareholders.
</p>
<p> Part IV Strategic Differentiation: Creating Comparative 
Advantage
</p>
<p>A seminal contribution in strategy was Michael E.&nbsp;Porter&rsquo;s five forces model (1980) 
</p>
<p>which profoundly influenced the thinking of researchers and practitioners in busi-
</p>
<p>ness strategy around the world since the 1980s. In essence, Porter argued from a 
</p>
<p>rather external, industry-based perspective that the goal of the strategist is to under-
</p>
<p>stand and cope not only with competition but with customers, suppliers, potential 
</p>
<p>entrants and, inevitably, also substitute products. These five forces define an indus-
</p>
<p>try&rsquo;s structure and shape the nature of competitive interaction within any industry 
</p>
<p>sector.
</p>
<p>Originally Porter was sceptical about social issues affecting business, but he 
</p>
<p>started to integrate the idea of sustainable business in his strategy model, recognis-
</p>
<p>ing that ESG issues form part of the competitive context in the medium and long 
</p>
<p>term. His concept of shared value is the vehicle for this, which was first published

<p>further on their core thesis of CSV (creating shared value): that businesses can

</p>
<p>this creates comparative advantage for the business and that the value for 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and society is more sustainable since it is underpinned with eco-
</p>
<p>nomic fundamentals.

<p>In an interview in 2013 with Gerard Baker, editor-in-chief of the Wall Street

<p>value by addressing social issues&rdquo;. He compared what companies like Nestl&eacute; and 
</p>
<p>Illycaff&egrave; are doing as examples of CSV with the fair trade approach, which is for

<p>Porter an example of CSR.&nbsp;Fair trade asks for a contribution from consumers in

<p>ethical consumer segment which is limited in size and volatile when consumer 
</p>
<p> priorities change. Instead, Illy pioneered a restructuring of the supply chain by cut-
</p>
<p>ting costs and investing in the skills and knowledge of farmers to produce higher-
</p>
<p>quality coffee (see Illy case study in this book). As a result, the farmers&rsquo; income 
</p>
<p>went up considerably and this was based on economic fundamentals, whereas in the 
</p>
<p>case of fair trade, it was dependent on the goodwill of consumers. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>Illy strengthened its competitive advantage by ensuring access to high-quality sup-
</p>
<p>plies in a sustainable way.
</p>
<p>A growing number of noteworthy global companies (Nestle, Coca-Cola, Johnson 
</p>
<p>&amp; Johnson, IBM, Umicore, General Electric, Unilever, GSK and others) have 
</p>
<p>already embraced the shared value concept through three sets of strategies:
</p>
<p> 1. Reconceiving products and services to better meet social and environmental 
</p>
<p>needs in a profitable way
</p>
<p> 2. Redefining productivity in the value chain to make more efficient and more 
</p>
<p>sustainable use of human and material resources, both in the supply and distribu-
</p>
<p>tion chain
</p>
<p> 3. Local cluster development
</p>
<p>They also strive for forming partnerships including NGOs who become partners 
</p>
<p>instead of adversaries. Local NGOs are often very well placed to take over certain 
</p>
<p>roles in the value chain, e.g. ensuring that medicines, provided by pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies at discount prices, find their way to the patients instead of into the black 
</p>
<p>market.
</p>
<p>Despite some irrefutable examples of companies, across many industries, bene-
</p>
<p>fitting from implementing shared value strategies, there still remain some lingering 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; cautionary sentiments. Some fear that the consequences of shared value 
</p>
<p>practices have not been fully explored and all the implications might not have been 
</p>
<p>fully considered.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, stakeholder pressure may force companies to become a more sus-
</p>
<p>tainable business, but it does not necessarily follow that the company or its market-
</p>
<p>place will actually become more sustainable. An example is Hydro Polymers 
</p>
<p>Limited, a division of Norsk Hydro ASA, which dramatically changed its strategy 
</p>
<p>due to outside pressure from Greenpeace activists. However, the rest of the industry 
</p>
<p>questioned Hydro Polymers&rsquo; motivation to commit to a more sustainable solution. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, China had become a major producer PVC often using environmentally 
</p>
<p>unfriendly technologies. Chinese PVC is, not surprisingly, much cheaper. If 
</p>
<p>European regulators do not prohibit the importation of &ldquo;Made in China PVC&rdquo;, the 
</p>
<p>question remains whether the end users will demand a shared value with a more 
</p>
<p>sustainable solution such as offered by Hydro Polymers or prefer to purchase the 
</p>
<p>Chinese PVC at the lower price.

</p>
<p> The Value of&nbsp;&ldquo;Creating Shared Value&rdquo; Contested
</p>
<p>In their critique of Porter&rsquo;s and Kramer&rsquo;s concept of creating shared value (CSV), 
</p>
<p>Crane and co-authors acknowledge the popularity that the concept has gained in the 
</p>
<p>business and academic literature4, its role in advancing social goals to strategic lev-
</p>
<p>els and its articulation of a clear government role in responsible behaviour and that 
</p>
<p>it adds rigour to ideas like &ldquo;conscious capitalism&rdquo;. At the same time, the authors 
</p>
<p>also state several shortcomings: (1) the concept is unoriginal, (2) it ignores the ten-
</p>
<p>sions inherent to responsible business activity, (3) it is naive about business compli-
</p>
<p>ance and (4) it is based on a shallow conception of the corporation&rsquo;s role in society 
</p>
<p>(Crane et&nbsp;al 2014). We appreciate the criticisms (in italics) and provide counterargu-
</p>
<p>ments for each, in defence of Porter, as follows:
</p>
<p> 1. Porter and Kramer claim that the CSV concept is a novelty while at the same 
</p>
<p>time it bears similarity to existing concepts of CSR, stakeholder management 
</p>
<p>and social innovation.
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer integrate some dimensions of these concepts indeed but 
</p>
<p>package them in a model and a language which is understood by managers. More 
</p>
<p>importantly, they do not start from societal issues and how companies should be 
</p>
<p>held &ldquo;responsible&rdquo;, which results in CSR programmes. Porter follows an entirely 
</p>
<p>different logic: he asks how corporate strategy can embrace ESG issues to make 
</p>
<p>the business more sustainable. He sees ESG issues as strategic opportunities for 
</p>
<p>the business and not as normative imperatives.
</p>
<p> 2. Many corporate decisions that are related to social and environmental problems 
</p>
<p>do not present themselves as potential win-wins but rather as dilemmas. When 
</p>
<p>faced with a dilemma, world views, identities, interests and values collide and 
</p>
<p>Porter doesn&rsquo;t address the tensions between social and economic goals; instead, 
</p>
<p>he only sees &ldquo;win-wins&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>But Porter never claimed that all solutions can be &ldquo;win-wins&rdquo;. However, he 
</p>
<p>suggests, similarly to Ed Freeman, the founder of stakeholder theory, that when 
</p>
<p>confronted with conflicts between economic and social goals, managers should 
</p>
<p>not complacently seek for compromises and trade-offs or pursue one at the 
</p>
<p>expense of the other. Instead, these conflicts should be seen as potential sources 
</p>
<p>of innovation, delivering solutions that may achieve both economic and social 
</p>
<p>goals. Sustainable business and sustainable economic and social development 
</p>
<p>will require substantial innovations.
</p>
<p> 3. Furthermore, the examples they provide might be pioneers in some aspects of 
</p>
<p>their operations while, at the same time, being criticised for harmful effects of 
</p>
<p>their products.
</p>
<p>The reality is very simply that companies like Nestl&eacute; get it right in some areas 
</p>
<p>of their value chain while not in other parts (yet) and should be encouraged 
</p>
<p>indeed to practise continuous improvement. If Nestl&eacute; uses Porter (who is a

</p>
<p> member of the board) and CSV to &ldquo;greenwash&rdquo; its more controversial parts of 
</p>
<p>the business, it should be criticised for this. But this does not diminish the value 
</p>
<p>of CSV itself.
</p>
<p> 4. According to critics, research shows that initiatives with the goal of promoting 
</p>
<p>sustainability for social and environmental gains only survive in economic terms, 
</p>
<p>ensuring longevity of quality supply for the purchasing company over social and 
</p>
<p>environmental needs of consumers or suppliers. There are indeed examples 
</p>
<p>where a CSV initiative proved not sustainable, but to generalise from this is short 
</p>
<p>sighted.
</p>
<p> 5. Despite the ambitious approach to reshape capitalism, CSV doesn&rsquo;t address the 
</p>
<p>deep-rooted problems that are at the centre of capitalism&rsquo;s legitimacy crisis. 
</p>
<p>Porter&rsquo;s own model of competitive strategy would need to be overturned.
</p>
<p>Reforming capitalism is a big subject indeed and the claim that CSV is the 
</p>
<p>panacea to this is indeed an exaggerated claim. The incomplete and unfinished 
</p>
<p>reform and governance of financial markets that induce notorious short-termism 
</p>
<p>seems more important. Business needs to pursue profitability and competitive-
</p>
<p>ness within clear frameworks of fair play, transparency and the rule of law and 
</p>
<p>with a perspective of long-term value creation. CSV alone will not restore the 
</p>
<p>legitimacy of capitalism but it might be a major contribution to it.
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s main contribution is to have coined a concept which 
</p>
<p>managers can embrace and which connects with their mindset, more than any 
</p>
<p>other concept on sustainable business. It serves the purpose of advancing the 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming of sustainable business as a concept for business generally and 
</p>
<p>for silencing the diehards of the old school who refuse to accept any important 
</p>
<p>role business can or should play in sustainable development. But of course it is 
</p>
<p>not a panacea. We publish a response to Porter which gives a thoughtful com-
</p>
<p>mentary on the importance of a normative motivation for managers to protect the 
</p>
<p>integrity of their actions in applying CSV. (See Chap. 17).
</p>
<p> Part V Business Model Innovation and&nbsp;Transformation
</p>
<p>Sustainable development with significantly reduced environmental and social 
</p>
<p>impacts is a formidable challenge for business of formidable magnitude, requiring 
</p>
<p>significant transformations in business models and industry structures, sooner for 
</p>
<p>some, later (but inevitable) for others. It will have revolutionising effects compara-
</p>
<p>ble to the effects of the consumer revolution of the 1980s and the IT revolution 
</p>
<p>which started at the end of the last century, when all businesses and industry sectors 
</p>
<p>underwent deep transformations. Reports by the World Business Council for 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development (WBCSD 2010), with membership of over 60 major 
</p>
<p>global firms, outline the challenges to come for the next 20&nbsp;years. Clearly, as with 
</p>
<p>previous transformations, there will be winners and losers of these developments.
</p>
<p>Sustainable business needs to adopt business models that can sustain this trans-
</p>
<p>formation, capitalise on it and create competitive edges in the wake of it. This likely 
</p>
<p>requires deep business model innovations.
</p>
<p>Managing Sustainable Business in a Global Context</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xxix
</p>
<p>Many managers consider the business model they are operating in as a given, the 
</p>
<p>best or even the only way to be profitable in a particular industry sector. However, 
</p>
<p>there are very different business models to choose from in a given industry. To begin 
</p>
<p>with, there are three generic value propositions:
</p>
<p>Operational Excellence by cost leadership, e.g. in oil exploration (Shell, BP), food 
</p>
<p>chains (Mc Donald&rsquo;s) and retail (Walmart, H&amp;M)
</p>
<p>Product-Service Leadership by product development, innovation and branding, e.g. 
</p>
<p>in footwear (Nike), pharmaceutical (Merck, GSK) and ITC (Google, Apple, 
</p>
<p>Microsoft)
</p>
<p>Total Customer Solutions by delivering complete solutions by integrated projects, 
</p>
<p>e.g. IBM Smarter Planet, Energy Solutions Companies (EON) and Private Banks 
</p>
<p>(ING)
</p>
<p>These different value propositions might exist in the same industry. In the solar 
</p>
<p>power industry, three value propositions and associated business models exist:
</p>
<p>Operational Excellence by production and distribution of standard cost competitive 
</p>
<p>solar panels
</p>
<p>Product-Service Leadership by development, installation and maintenance of tech-
</p>
<p>nological advanced solar systems or hybrid systems branded for high perfor-
</p>
<p>mance even under weak sunlight conditions
</p>
<p>Total Customer Solutions by conceiving and realising customised and co-created 
</p>
<p>energy provisions where no electric grid is available, including extending provi-
</p>
<p>sions for health care, schooling and agriculture, generally in partnerships with 
</p>
<p>NGOs
</p>
<p>These business models are not necessarily competing with each other. These are 
</p>
<p>different ways of creating, delivering and capturing value in one industry. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>in the IT industry, there are different business models to be found. Apple, Google, 
</p>
<p>IBM, Microsoft and Lenovo not only have different value propositions to their cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. The entire business models behind their propositions are very different.
</p>
<p>In addition to innovations in products, services and processes, as discussed in the 
</p>
<p>previous chapter, business can create competitive advantage or avoid erosion of cur-
</p>
<p>rent, often highly profitable market positions by exploring new business models.
</p>
<p>IBM realised that its PC business would over time not be able to compete with 
</p>
<p>Chinese market entrants and sold the business to a Chinese newcomer Lenovo at a 
</p>
<p>time when the market value of the PC business was still high. IBM moved up the 
</p>
<p>value chain into a Total Customer Solution value proposition with the Smarter 
</p>
<p>Planet initiative and a business operating model behind it which is significantly dif-
</p>
<p>ferent (see Chap. 25). IBM thus positions itself in the sustainability transformation 
</p>
<p>with an innovative business model.
</p>
<p>BP Solarex was a market leader in the solar industry in 2000. It scaled back its 
</p>
<p>business model to a pure Operational Excellence proposition (manufacturing and 
</p>
<p>distributing solar panels), inspired by the idea of focusing on &ldquo;core competences&rdquo;,

</p>
<p>a fashion already on its way out. Experiments with Total Customer Solutions as 
</p>
<p>described above were halted and abolished. Ten years later, BP was forced to close 
</p>
<p>most manufacturing facilities at high cost in the face of stiff cost competition from 
</p>
<p>China. In 2000, BP would have been able to sell these facilities at considerable 
</p>
<p>market value and move up the value chain. In 2010, it was too late.
</p>
<p>Particular interest should be paid to business model innovation for sustainability.

<p>Business model innovation may be focused on the industry sector model, the 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurial model or the financial model. These three dimensions of the busi-
</p>
<p>ness model are discrete, but they may be interdependent.
</p>
<p>The industry sector model: Business model innovation changes the entire indus-
</p>
<p>try: Google, IBM and Dell.
</p>
<p>The entrepreneurial model: Business model innovation changes the value chain in 
</p>
<p>major ways: Umicore, Illy and IPOed Batteries. In this last case, a move to focus 
</p>
<p>on core competencies in materials development was complemented by creating 
</p>
<p>a network of partnerships and outsourced activities.
</p>
<p>The financial model: Business model innovation creates entirely new pricing mod-

</p>
<p>There are seven key questions about business model innovation5:
</p>
<p> 1. Which current needs will the business model address&mdash;or which new needs will 
</p>
<p>it create?
</p>
<p> 2. Which innovative activities can create value by meeting these needs?
</p>
<p> 3. How can these activities be linked in innovative ways?
</p>
<p> 4. Who will perform which activities and which innovative governance will be 
</p>
<p>needed?
</p>
<p> 5. How will value be created and delivered for each stakeholder?
</p>
<p> 6. How can value be co-created by engagement with the communities?
</p>
<p> 7. Which revenue models will make the business model sustainable?
</p>
<p>Business model innovation is neither about minor changes to the business model 
</p>
<p>to capture easy gains in costs and efficiency nor about a compliance-driven adapta-
</p>
<p>tion to gradually minimise negative impacts.
</p>
<p>Business model transformations for sustainability have specific requirements in 
</p>
<p>terms of significantly enhanced social and environmental positive impacts. 
</p>
<p>SustainAbility&rsquo;s 2014 report on business model transformation for sustainability 
</p>
<p>(see Chap. 22) describes 20 business model innovations for sustainability in five 
</p>
<p>categories:
</p>
<p>Environmental impact
</p>
<p>Social impact
</p>
<p>Financial innovation
</p>
<p>Base of the pyramid
</p>
<p>Diverse impact
</p>
<p>Nigel Roome, a major contributor to the theory and practice of business model 
</p>
<p>innovation for sustainability, and C&eacute;line Louche explain the key characteristics of a 
</p>
<p>business model for sustainability as describing, analysing, managing and 
</p>
<p>communicating:
</p>
<p> (i) A company&rsquo;s sustainable value proposition to its customers and all other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders
</p>
<p> (ii) How it creates and delivers this value
</p>
<p> (iii) How it captures economic value while maintaining or regenerating natural, 
</p>
<p>social and economic capital beyond its organisational boundaries
</p>
<p>Furthermore, they argue that sustainable value for customers and shareholders 
</p>
<p>can only be created by creating value to a broader range of stakeholders. A business 
</p>
<p>is embedded in a stakeholder network and&mdash;in spite of the fact that a business model 
</p>
<p>is a market-oriented approach&mdash;particularly a business that contributes to

<p> Part VI Managing Change: Developing Dynamic Capabilities 
and&nbsp;HR Talent
</p>
<p>In response to Michael Porter&rsquo;s external industry structure perspective on strategy, 
</p>
<p>Jay Barney (1991) developed a resource-based view focusing on internal resources. 
</p>
<p>This model criticised the basic assumption behind the industry-based view, i.e. that 
</p>
<p>firms have the same resources or the same access to resources to implement strate-
</p>
<p>gies. This assumption ignores the company&rsquo;s resources heterogeneity, and mobility,

</p>
<p>as possible sources of competitive advantage. He observed that businesses develop 
</p>
<p>strong competitive positions based on various resources including all assets, capa-
</p>
<p>bilities, organisational processes, corporate attributes, information and knowledge 
</p>
<p>that enable the firm to develop and implement strategies which are designed improve 
</p>
<p>its competitiveness.
</p>
<p>Porter&rsquo;s five forces framework, which applied the structure-performance para-
</p>
<p>digm of industrial organisation economics to strategy, focused on evaluating suppli-
</p>
<p>ers, customers and the threat of new entrants and/or substitute products. This 
</p>
<p>framework is still valid to a certain extent, but it does not succeed in revealing the 
</p>
<p>dominant logic of value capture in newer industries and in newer fields like sustain-
</p>
<p>ability. This dominant logic is now recognised to be the way businesses develop 
</p>
<p>core resources which are unique, rare and difficult to imitate and by definition take 
</p>
<p>a long time to grow and materialise.
</p>
<p>Core resources include knowledge (including manifest and tacit understanding 
</p>
<p>of the dynamics of markets and social contracts), relationships (unique relation-
</p>
<p>ships with all stakeholders in the value chain and in the economic, social and politi-
</p>
<p>cal context of the business), capabilities (managerial, HR talent and organisational 
</p>
<p>resources) and purpose (encompasses the basic values and beliefs shared with 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and the distinctive contribution of the business to the wellbeing of 
</p>
<p>stakeholders).
</p>
<p>An overarching resource for comparative advantage is called &ldquo;dynamic 
</p>
<p>capability&rdquo;. This is the capability of the organisation for purposefully creating, 
</p>
<p>extending and modifying the resource base of the business, by building, integrating 
</p>
<p>and reconfiguring internal and external competences to respond to rapidly changing 
</p>
<p>environments and contexts, not in the least the social, political and environmental 
</p>
<p>context.
</p>
<p>Dynamic capabilities are distinct from operational capabilities (which are based 
</p>
<p>on current competencies), and it goes well beyond the popular concept of &ldquo;core 
</p>
<p>competencies&rdquo;. The demise of companies like Kodak and Nokia demonstrated the 
</p>
<p>limitations of the latter.
</p>
<p>Success of today is the greatest enemy of tomorrow&rsquo;s success, Peter Drucker is 
</p>
<p>supposed to have said (although the quote cannot be traced). So a key question fol-
</p>
<p>lows from this: how can executives of currently successful companies change 
</p>
<p>their existing mental models and paradigms to adapt to radical and often dis-
</p>
<p>ruptive change to come, not in the least in the face of the sustainability 
</p>
<p>transformation.
</p>
<p>The main dilemma in the practice of management is to make the best of 
</p>
<p>existing resources yet at the same time grasp the ongoing depreciation of this 
</p>
<p>resource base.
</p>
<p>The concept of dynamic capabilities, especially understood in terms of organisa-
</p>
<p>tional knowledge processes and management culture, is a predominant concept to 
</p>
<p>explain the significant competitive advantages of firms across a wide range of indus-
</p>
<p>tries like Apple, IBM, BMW and Johnson &amp; Johnson.
</p>
<p>Organisations and their staff need the capability and agility to learn quickly and 
</p>
<p>to build strategic knowledge assets and integrate these into business processes. This

</p>
<p>means effectively developing capacities to sense and shape opportunities and 
</p>
<p>threats, to seize opportunities and to maintain competitiveness through enhancing, 
</p>
<p>combining, protecting and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business intangible 
</p>
<p>and tangible asset base.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Path dependency&rdquo; is a term which refers to the natural reliance of organisations 
</p>
<p>and managers to continue thinking and acting in patterns that evolved over time in 
</p>
<p>the history of the business and the industry sector. Path dependency is a particular 
</p>
<p>impediment for managers and organisations in responding to discontinuous ongoing 
</p>
<p>change.
</p>
<p>Dynamic capability is an extended paradigm explaining how competitive 
</p>
<p>advantage is gained and held. Firms resorting to resource-based strategy attempt 
</p>
<p>to accumulate valuable technology assets and employ an aggressive intellectual 
</p>
<p>property stance. However, winners in the global marketplace have been firms dem-
</p>
<p>onstrating timely responsiveness and rapid and flexible product innovation, along 
</p>
<p>with the management capability to effectively coordinate and redeploy internal and 
</p>
<p>external competences. The sustainability transformation will require a formidable 
</p>
<p>range of dynamic capabilities sizing two aspects. First, it refers to the shifting char-
</p>
<p>acter of the environment; second, it emphasises the key role of strategic manage-
</p>
<p>ment in appropriately adapting, integrating and reconfiguring internal and external 
</p>
<p>organisational skills, resources and functional competences towards changing 
</p>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p>It is often said that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. One 
</p>
<p>could even slightly exaggerate and claim that there is nothing but theory, since prac-
</p>
<p>tice is effectively only theory-in-use. John Maynard Keynes shocked politicians and 
</p>
<p>business executives alike when he claimed:
</p>
<p>Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, 
</p>
<p>are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in 
</p>
<p>the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.
</p>
<p>Leaving exaggeration aside, the concept of dynamic capabilities challenges man-
</p>
<p>agers to question their assumptions, theories, models and beliefs, in other words, 
</p>
<p>their theories in use which fashion and inform their actions. Some executives are 
</p>
<p>still complacent about the formidable challenge of managing sustainable business 
</p>
<p>and sustainable development. They find it difficult to grasp the full and complex 
</p>
<p>picture of business and its context. They are maybe likely to get away with it for 
</p>
<p>some time, but their businesses will inevitably not belong to the winners in the 
</p>
<p>global economy of tomorrow.
</p>
<p>The sustainability revolution is unfolding as one of the great transformations in 
</p>
<p>global business and of a much bigger and deeper scale than the consumer revolution 
</p>
<p>or the IT revolution. Since the world has embraced in Paris the idea that a zero car-
</p>
<p>bon emissions economy will be the inevitable goal to be reached sometime this 
</p>
<p>century, rather sooner than later, most certainties, business models, recipes for suc-
</p>
<p>cess and other beaten paths will become redundant. Businesses with the greatest 
</p>
<p>reservoir of dynamic capability will be the winners in the global marketplace by

</p>
<p>disruptive innovation, radical self-invention and relentless development of new 
</p>
<p>talent.
</p>
<p>One of the key questions &ldquo;what new talent is needed to enhance the dynamic 
</p>
<p>capability of the business for the sustainability transformation?&rdquo; is still unre-
</p>
<p>solved. Matthew Gitsham (in Chap. 31) explores this question through interviews 
</p>
<p>with global CEOs, leading academics and consultants. He has clustered these tal-
</p>
<p>ents around three poles: talents required related to grasping context, complexity 
</p>
<p>and connectedness. These largely cognitive talents will need to be complemented 
</p>
<p>by some new character traits such as curiosity and ongoing questioning, systems 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;feeling&rdquo; and empathy, courageousness in trespassing boundaries and challenging 
</p>
<p>the status quo. This will require a major departure from a CEO culture of potent 
</p>
<p>self-assurance, unquestionable certainty bordering on arrogance, linear pursuit of 
</p>
<p>single-minded goals and defensiveness of extant assumptions.
</p>
<p>Participants in EMBA programmes and in programmes of executive education at 
</p>
<p>large form the talent pool from which the leaders will emerge to steer businesses 
</p>
<p>through the sustainability transformation which is unfolding. Their deep immersion 
</p>
<p>into sustainability risk management, issues management, stakeholder management, 
</p>
<p>strategic differentiation with new sustainable value propositions, business model 
</p>
<p>innovation capitalising on sustainability opportunities and fostering dynamic capa-
</p>
<p>bilities for sustainable business development is a must if one takes the future 
</p>
<p>seriously.

<p>Introduction, Justification and Outline1

</p>
<p> Justification and&nbsp;Objectives of&nbsp;This Book
</p>
<p>Over the last 10&nbsp;years or so, directors of executive education, EMBA and MBA 
</p>
<p>programmes have been seeking to integrate &ldquo;something about business ethics, CSR 
</p>
<p>or sustainability&rdquo; into their programmes. While these subjects are usually optional 
</p>
<p>courses in the MBA curriculum, Exec Ed and EMBA programmes increasingly fea-
</p>
<p>ture mandatory modules in this field.
</p>
<p>Clearly market pressures are pushing for a faster integration at the Exec Ed level. 
</p>
<p>We know of many companies exerting pressure in governing bodies of business 
</p>
<p>schools, such that the dean and faculty finally come to terms with the urgent neces-
</p>
<p>sity of paying serious attention to the wider responsibilities of the firm, its impacts 
</p>
<p>on society and the environment, its role in countries with weak governance and 
</p>
<p>more.
</p>
<p>Craig Smith as the lead editor and myself published Mainstreaming Corporate 
</p>
<p>Responsibility in 2009. It was primarily intended to support professors in strategy, 
</p>
<p>accounting, marketing, economics and operations management&mdash;all the core sub-
</p>
<p>jects of the MBA curriculum&mdash;in integrating ESG (environmental, social, gover-
</p>
<p>nance) issues into their courses with appropriate texts and cases.
</p>
<p>This new book in front of you is addressed primarily at the EMBA level and Exec 
</p>
<p>Ed programmes, and, as such, it is not organised by the classical MBA subjects. 
</p>
<p>Instead, it follows the rationale of the business manager&mdash;how she/he gets con-
</p>
<p>fronted with sustainability challenges and how he/she and his/her organisation 
</p>
<p>builds ways and means for addressing them in a practical way, yet also with meth-
</p>
<p>odological rigour.
</p>
<p>We are steering clear of the term &ldquo;CSR&rdquo; as much as we can in this book. The 
</p>
<p>term seems to be controversial with managers. CSR is often seen as the remit of the 
</p>
<p>1 We want to acknowledge the editorial and academic support by Dr Ludwig Roger for his dedica-
</p>
<p>tion and expertise and for keeping us, editors, on track through a process that lasted 3&nbsp;years.</p>
<p/>

<p>xl
</p>
<p>CSR department (and not of line management) to deal with. It is seen as rather a 
</p>
<p>tactical or defensive activity or at worst a PR exercise, rightly or wrongly associated 
</p>
<p>with &ldquo;doing good&rdquo; or philanthropy. The reasons for the controversy are manifold 
</p>
<p>and often not entirely justified. However, we wish stay clear of these 
</p>
<p>misunderstandings.
</p>
<p>The subject of sustainable business stretches, in the mind of the manager, far 
</p>
<p>beyond challenges of social responsibility and includes concerns about risk man-
</p>
<p>agement in relation to externalities, strategic issues management as social trends 
</p>
<p>emerge, seeking competitive advantage and transforming business models with sus-
</p>
<p>tainability issues, broad-based strategy generation and implementation through 
</p>
<p>stakeholder management.
</p>
<p>All these concerns are instrumental in nature driven by the pressures of markets, 
</p>
<p>societies and governmental and non-governmental organisations or inspired by 
</p>
<p>long-term aspirations to claim industry leadership and seek first-mover advantages 
</p>
<p>or simply to be recognised among the globally most excellent companies. These 
</p>
<p>companies, it is assumed, attract more easily top talent and are more trusted by 
</p>
<p>regulators, partners and customers, which can substantially reduce transaction costs.
</p>
<p>Michael Porter defined competitive advantage as dependent on the position of 
</p>
<p>the firm in the value chain and on how it deals with the five forces that define the 
</p>
<p>industry structure. However, it is now easily recognised by managers that no matter 
</p>
<p>how important the position of the company in the value chain and in the industry 
</p>
<p>structure, the long-lasting advantages of the firm are to be found in the intangible 
</p>
<p>resources which can be leveraged beyond the industry structure. These intangible 
</p>
<p>resources are embedded in knowledge, relationships, capabilities and binding 
</p>
<p>purpose, which can be leveraged for creating value with all stakeholders.
</p>
<p>There is, of course, a whole body of research and a school of resource-based 
</p>
<p>strategic reasoning to support this, but managers come to this conclusion purely 
</p>
<p>based on their observation and experiential knowledge and find the ongoing aca-
</p>
<p>demic divide on the best way to create competitive advantage rather irrelevant. An 
</p>
<p>industry sector view and a resource-based view are perceived to be complementary 
</p>
<p>by managers.
</p>
<p>Many managers find also that opposing shareholder value to stakeholder value is 
</p>
<p>maybe of theoretical significance, but not of much practical significance and a mis-
</p>
<p>leading way of painting managerial realities. Both pressures are continuously invad-
</p>
<p>ing processes of managerial decision making, and opposing these from the outset 
</p>
<p>hinders a clear focus on long-term value creation. In other words, opposing stake-
</p>
<p>holder value to shareholder value may provoke the unintended opposite effect.
</p>
<p>The clich&eacute; that the pursuit of profit is most of the time opposed to &ldquo;responsible 
</p>
<p>behaviour&rdquo; does not resonate with the new generation of managers who are coming 
</p>
<p>to Exec Ed programmes. They have a more balanced outlook and consider these 
</p>
<p>oppositions as abstractions or even aberrations of the real-life world of 
</p>
<p>management.
</p>
<p>Of course many (top) executives are driven by power, ego and financial gain, but 
</p>
<p>in my observation, most are driven by a strong nonfinancial performance aspiration. 
</p>
<p>This is key for understanding managerial behaviour.
</p>
<p>Introduction, Justification and Outline</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xli
</p>
<p>This performance aspiration is not primarily focused on financial performance 
</p>
<p>but rather shaped by the desire to achieve challenging goals, to rise above conflict-
</p>
<p>ing agendas, to solve difficult problems and to be seen as smart by accomplishing 
</p>
<p>what others find impossible to achieve. It is easy to see how this perception of mana-
</p>
<p>gerial motivation can be conducive for facilitating learning on sustainable business. 
</p>
<p>There is therefore no need for moral teaching and telling managers to be more 
</p>
<p>responsible. This is generally not effective anyway.
</p>
<p>However, the desire to be seen as smart by doing the nearly impossible does have 
</p>
<p>flipsides, as the recent emissions scandal surrounding Volkswagen has clearly dem-
</p>
<p>onstrated. Therefore, this book pleads for an approach of developing practical wis-
</p>
<p>dom in the subject of sustainable business by:
</p>
<p>Starting from practical real-life concerns instead of theoretical concerns and recog-
</p>
<p>nising profit seeking as a natural and primordial drive for managers and 
</p>
<p>businesses
</p>
<p>Subscribing to the position that the business of business is profitable business 
</p>
<p>indeed, but with the critical question of what makes business profitability 
</p>
<p>sustainable
</p>
<p>Providing texts to provoke critical thinking and critical debate on how to achieve 
</p>
<p>sustainable profitability
</p>
<p>Providing cases that are as close to the business reality and complexity as possible, 
</p>
<p>where the link between financial and nonfinancial performance issues is always 
</p>
<p>present
</p>
<p>Building up a rationale for a step-by-step learning process in six different stages:
</p>
<p>Risk management
</p>
<p>Issues management
</p>
<p>Stakeholder management
</p>
<p>Creating competitive advantage
</p>
<p>Fostering innovation and transformation
</p>
<p>Building organisational capabilities
</p>
<p>There is currently high interest from the corporate world in what makes a sus-
</p>
<p>tainable business and the large majority of participants of Exec Ed programmes and 
</p>
<p>the EMBA see the subject as integral to their development and further learning. We 
</p>
<p>hope we have provided a book that can help to respond to these expectations.
</p>
<p> Managing Sustainable Business: An&nbsp;Introduction
</p>
<p>What is meant by the term &ldquo;sustainable business&rdquo;? If one asks managers what they 
</p>
<p>understand by the term&mdash;and this can be a good topic for an opening debate in an 
</p>
<p>EMBA class&mdash;one typically gets the following responses:
</p>
<p> &ndash; A business that is well managed for the long term
</p>
<p> &ndash; A business with a robust business model, a prudent financial model and highly 
</p>
<p>developed value propositions for customers and all other stakeholders
</p>
<p>Introduction, Justification and Outline</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xlii
</p>
<p> &ndash; A business that can anticipate or respond flexibly to sudden changes in the busi-
</p>
<p>ness environment, including the social and political environment
</p>
<p> &ndash; A business that is capable of transforming its business model in the face of irre-
</p>
<p>versible deep changes in markets and in the expectations of society
</p>
<p> &ndash; A business that commands respect and trust
</p>
<p> &ndash; A business which is aware of the contexts it operates in and the shifting require-
</p>
<p>ments of these contexts
</p>
<p>One can identify a generic use of the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; in the sense of lasting, 
</p>
<p>robust, long-term oriented, which encompasses the entire business. Most managers 
</p>
<p>sense that their business should stay clear of opportunistic, high risk, short-term- 
</p>
<p>driven motives determined by profit maximisation only. They have seen the spec-
</p>
<p>tacular failures of this approach in the past with respected companies like Daimler 
</p>
<p>Benz, Marks &amp; Spencer, Citigroup and others, whose managers abandoned pride 
</p>
<p>and purpose for power and stock options and in the end almost ruined their company 
</p>
<p>and destroyed shareholder value on a massive scale. These concerns are about cor-
</p>
<p>porate sustainability.
</p>
<p>At the same time, managers associate sustainable business with sustainability, 
</p>
<p>which is a term that can be traced to the Brundtland Report (Our Common Future, 
</p>
<p>1987) on sustainable development and refers to accountability of the company for 
</p>
<p>its impacts.
</p>
<p>Managers recognise that managing impacts and issues (economic, social, ethical, 
</p>
<p>political, environmental) is often ignored in mainstream courses on strategy and 
</p>
<p>business environment in EMBA programmes. However, managing impacts and 
</p>
<p>issues is but a part of the entire challenge of sustainable business. Excelling in sus-
</p>
<p>tainable HR and talent management, sustainable finance, sustainable marketing, 
</p>
<p>sustainable expansion into new markets, needs to be part of an overall approach  
</p>
<p>to sustainable business. Effective stakeholder management, innovation and  
</p>
<p>developing dynamic capabilities are key in this broad based approach. (See Parts III, 
</p>
<p>IV, V and VI).
</p>
<p> Sustainable Business: An&nbsp;Outline
</p>
<p>Given the above assumptions of managers and our reflections, we can attempt to 
</p>
<p>outline an agenda for sustainable business:
</p>
<p>&bull; A sustainable business is highly responsive to the demands and challenges of 
</p>
<p>both markets and societies.
</p>
<p>&bull; It optimises competitiveness as well as legitimacy and mutually beneficial rela-
</p>
<p>tionships with key stakeholders by constantly adapting and renewing its value 
</p>
<p>propositions through its portfolio of products, services, brand positioning and 
</p>
<p>communications.
</p>
<p>&bull; It also pays attention to the long-term shifts in the political, social and ecological 
</p>
<p>environment on which it depends for its resources.
</p>
<p>Introduction, Justification and Outline</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>xliii
</p>
<p>&bull; It is concerned about its reputational capital and the trust (social capital) it 
</p>
<p>needs to keep transaction costs low and to benefit from a favourable licence to 
</p>
<p>operate.
</p>
<p>Managing sustainable business has become increasingly complex. There are sev-
</p>
<p>eral causes:
</p>
<p>Globalisation has heralded new opportunities for companies but also causes new 
</p>
<p>complexities in global supply chains, global competition, cross-cultural complexi-
</p>
<p>ties and clashes of values and norms, weak governance environments, challenges to 
</p>
<p>the power and legitimacy of big business and anti-globalisation movements.
</p>
<p>The ICT revolution has transformed the way business is done and managed, but 
</p>
<p>it has also made the global critical village possible. Global interconnectedness 
</p>
<p>makes news travel fast and endangers reputational capital by sound-bite-driven 
</p>
<p>media. Social, environmental and political issues can emerge and spread quickly 
</p>
<p>and pose risks as well as opportunities for nimble companies.
</p>
<p>Macro trends such as climate change, resource depletion, environmental deple-
</p>
<p>tion, demographic change, geopolitical change, talent shortages and increasing rich- 
</p>
<p>poor divides between and within societies affect business models in the medium to 
</p>
<p>long term and create new winners and losers.
</p>
<p>This affects all business functions: procurement, marketing, finance, accounting, 
</p>
<p>human resource management, product development and R&amp;D.&nbsp;It will also affect the 
</p>
<p>economics of the business models and the valuation of equities through risk assess-
</p>
<p>ment and risk mitigation and will change the competitive context of entire industries 
</p>
<p>by the bets companies are likely to make to take advantage of changing 
</p>
<p>circumstances.
</p>
<p>The challenges to the governance of the firm are thus formidable, not in the least 
</p>
<p>because investors are looking increasingly at the sustainability risks and opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties underlying the business model and the long-term strategy of companies. Firms 
</p>
<p>are well advised to take a strategic approach to these challenges in order to identify 
</p>
<p>threats and opportunities as well as their strengths and weaknesses.
</p>
<p>Resources need to be allocated, capabilities need to be developed and new 
</p>
<p>knowledge needs to be harnessed. This requires sound judgement beyond normative 
</p>
<p>rhetoric on leadership and corporate responsibility.
</p>
<p>The normative rhetoric which is so pervasively used by activists within and out-
</p>
<p>side the business schools is a serious impediment for mainstreaming the sustainable 
</p>
<p>business agenda in executive education and executive practice, since this does not 
</p>
<p>connect with the life world of executives and at best leads to tactical responses to 
</p>
<p>activists&rsquo; demands.
</p>
<p>On the other side, some CEOs might be posturing and paying lip service to the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;urgent needs&rdquo; of &ldquo;concerted action&rdquo; and the &ldquo;transformational change required&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>but fail to lead and manage change internally, not in the least because management 
</p>
<p>development for sustainable development is not adequate and because only a lim-
</p>
<p>ited number of business schools seem capable of supporting this.

<p> A Managerial Framework for&nbsp;Sustainable Business
</p>
<p>Fundamental in this framework is the understanding of business imbedded in its 
</p>
<p>context.
</p>
<p> 1. Risk Management: Managing the Accountabilities of Business
</p>
<p>Knowledge management of inside-out impacts of the business model and the 
</p>
<p>business strategy and managing accountabilities for impacts (externalities) in 
</p>
<p>shifting social contract environments
</p>
<p> 2. Issues Management: Managing the &ldquo;Responsibilities&rdquo; of Business
</p>
<p>Knowledge management of outside-in impacts of new issues from the business 
</p>
<p>environment on the business and adopting appropriate organisational responses for 
</p>
<p>latent, emerging and maturing issues of &ldquo;corporate responsibility&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 3. Stakeholder Management: Managing Competitiveness and Trust
</p>
<p>Identifying, prioritising and weighing importance of key stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>managing relationships as key resources for comparative advantage
</p>
<p> 4. Strategic Differentiation: Creating Competitive Advantage
</p>
<p>Developing sustainability value propositions to markets and stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>including reconceiving products and services, redefining productivity in the 
</p>
<p>value chain and developing partnerships
</p>
<p> 5. Innovation and Business Model Transformation: Taking Great Leaps Forward
</p>
<p>Identifying and entering market spaces with high sustainable value and trans-
</p>
<p>forming business models and capabilities to capitalise on emerging market value
</p>
<p> 6. Managing Change: Developing Dynamic Capabilities and Managerial Talents
</p>
<p>Developing organisational capabilities and managerial knowledge, skills and 
</p>
<p>mindsets for sustainable business
</p>
<p> Closing Reflection
</p>
<p>A final reflection in this introduction concerns the instrumental/strategic versus the 
</p>
<p>moral/normative case for sustainable business. My co-author Craig Smith who is an 
</p>
<p>eminent professor of CSR and business ethics at INSEAD and I have had long 
</p>
<p>debates on this, and we come from different perspectives. However, in the end we 
</p>
<p>concluded that the opposition between both perspectives may be false and that they 
</p>
<p>are rather complementary.
</p>
<p>A purely strategic approach without any moral compass may not be sustainable 
</p>
<p>since it may appear to stakeholders as not entirely sincere and trustworthy. A norma-
</p>
<p>tive approach without strategic business underpinning may appear to shareholders 
</p>
<p>as naive, unrealistic and a moral luxury and fall victim to the next round of 
</p>
<p>cost-cutting.
</p>
<p>But a normative framework like the UN Global Compact on Sustainable Business 
</p>
<p>seems the minimum indispensable requirement.

</p>
<p>We agreed that win-win solutions may not be possible all the time and that trade- 
</p>
<p>offs made by managers in favour of short-term profits will be difficult to resist or 
</p>
<p>avoid but should be criticised nevertheless.
</p>
<p>In any case, the question whether sustainability is part of business ethics or rather 
</p>
<p>that addressing ethical issues is part of sustainable business in a very &ldquo;academic&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>question indeed.
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank Craig for his enduring commitment to this book and his relent-
</p>
<p>less production of new interesting case studies and for the enlightening debates we

<p>Part I
</p>
<p>Introduction: Risk Management&nbsp;&ndash; Managing 
the Accountabilities of the Firm
</p>
<p>Gilbert&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Lenssen 
</p>
<p>Risk management is based on timely knowledge management of the inside-out 
</p>
<p>impacts of the business model and the business strategy on the social, environmen-
</p>
<p>tal, economical and governance/political context (ESG context). It forms the basis, 
</p>
<p>the very first step of managing sustainable business.
</p>
<p>These impacts are from a business economics perspective &ldquo;cost externalities&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>which enhance the cost advantages of the business but may sooner or later become 
</p>
<p>controversial if they touch on the formal and explicit social contract(s) the business 
</p>
<p>operates under. The informal social contract of implicit or emerging expectations is 
</p>
<p>the subject of the next chapter on issues management.
</p>
<p>The formal social contract context(s) the business operates in determines explicit 
</p>
<p>expectations which require compliance with the letter and the spirit of legislation, 
</p>
<p>with international codes and standards, both hard law and soft law, from, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, the ILO, OECD, and the UN Global Compact.
</p>
<p>Manifest risks include social risks, environmental risks, political risks, regula-
</p>
<p>tory risks, even cultural risks, and may be located in the supply chain, the distribu-
</p>
<p>tion chain, in product liabilities, in production facilities, in joint ventures, in mergers 
</p>
<p>and acquisitions (hence importance of ESG due diligence), and may be specific to 
</p>
<p>geographies like conflict zones and cultural risks in new markets.
</p>
<p>Apart from manifest risks, there are always underlying risks such as managerial 
</p>
<p>risks related to competencies and management attitudes, risk/return balances, 
</p>
<p>organisational risks in organisational culture and structure, processes, systems and 
</p>
<p>skills as well as corporate governance risks in lack of oversight of Boards, and in not 
</p>
<p>critically questioning.
</p>
<p>Risk management requires in the last instance proficient crisis management and 
</p>
<p>communications.
</p>
<p>Key Questions to Ask (Applicable to All Part I Cases)
</p>
<p>What is the business model of the company?
</p>
<p>What are the ESG impacts of the business model and business strategy?
</p>
<p>Which are the inherent risks (social, environmental, political, regulatory) in this 
</p>
<p>model?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2
</p>
<p>Apart from manifest risks, can one identify underlying risks?
</p>
<p>Which risk prioritisation and risk mitigation processes are being applied?
</p>
<p>Where could/did the risk management process derail?
</p>
<p>What improvements can you suggest to risk mitigation management? To crisis and 
</p>
<p>communications management?
</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Scenario Approach to Possible Futures for Oil and Gas by 
</p>
<p>Jeremy Bentham and James Schofield
</p>
<p>The externalities of the business models of oil exploration, transportation, refining 
</p>
<p>and distribution are considerable, hence the importance of risk management in this 
</p>
<p>industry. Scenario planning is a useful tool for charting possible future risks and to 
</p>
<p>prepare management for adequate responses to whatever scenario materialises. In 
</p>
<p>addition, Shell&rsquo;s scenario planning charts geo-political and cultural risks and how 
</p>
<p>they play out in different parallel scripts. This forms the basis for strategic decision 
</p>
<p>making, but foremost for preparedness for different risks to the business model, 
</p>
<p>according to different scenarios. Shell&rsquo;s scenario scripts include economic, social, 
</p>
<p>environmental, (geo-) political and even cultural factors that play into the futures of 
</p>
<p>the energy markets.
</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Beyond BP: The Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon Disaster 2010 
</p>
<p>by David Grayson
</p>
<p>This BP case is illustrative of many of the troubling risks an oil company can be 
</p>
<p>exposed to. Deep water drilling enhances risks, especially so if involving joint- 
</p>
<p>ventures with other companies on the same platform. If the safety and environmen-
</p>
<p>tal policies of the mother company (BP) are not wholly supported by merged or 
</p>
<p>acquired businesses (Amoco), risks are exacerbated. If continuous signals from the 
</p>
<p>acquired businesses (e.g., Alaska pipeline affair, Texas refinery incident) fail to be 
</p>
<p>addressed in a structural way, disaster is waiting to happen. If the crisis management 
</p>
<p>and crisis communication by senior management adds disaster to disaster, the very 
</p>
<p>existence of the company is put at risk. BP lost 52% of its share value, an equivalent 
</p>
<p>of $105 billion in the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010. In the mean-
</p>
<p>time, the share price has recovered but it is still hovering at 35% below 2009 
</p>
<p>levels.
</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Sustainable Product Index by N.&nbsp;Craig Smith and 
</p>
<p>Robert Crawford
</p>
<p>Walmart is a successful business offering every-day low prices and thereby conve-
</p>
<p>niently serving urban and rural communities, including many poor people who oth-
</p>
<p>erwise would not be able to afford the goods provided. Walmart also employs 
</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of low-skilled people who find it otherwise difficult in the 
</p>
<p>labour market. Crucial to its success as a low price/low cost leader is the rigorous 
</p>
<p>elimination of costs in both the supply and the distribution chain, which can give 
</p>
<p>rise to negative environmental and social impacts. This has created serious chal-
</p>
<p>lenges in the court of public opinion in the past and Walmart was forced to

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3
</p>
<p>implement policies reducing these impacts, whilst keeping the business model 
</p>
<p>largely intact. In this case study, Walmart tries to mitigate the ongoing risks by ral-
</p>
<p>lying consumers into a more sustainable way of consumption. Will it work? Is 
</p>
<p>Walmart trying to shift part of the blame on to consumers? Is this a credible and 
</p>
<p>sustainable risk mitigation strategy?
</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Tetra Pak in China by Fu Jia, Zhaohui Wu and Jonathan Gosling
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak in China is deeply integrated into the dairy supply chain and its main 
</p>
<p>customers are the biggest domestic milk (and other dairy) producers in China in a 
</p>
<p>market with exponential growth up to mid 2008, when the melamine milk contami-
</p>
<p>nation scandal hit the domestic producers. The supply chain in China is highly frag-
</p>
<p>mented beginning with millions of dairy farmers and an extensive network of milk 
</p>
<p>processing plants. Tetra Pak finds itself in a typical emerging market risk situation: 
</p>
<p>rapid (unsustainable) growth, local production (but of variable quality and safety 
</p>
<p>standards) preferred by the socio-political context, and an underdeveloped regula-
</p>
<p>tory framework. Moreover, despite its track record of engaged stakeholder manage-
</p>
<p>ment and a long-time commitment to a life cycle approach to packaging, Tetra Pak 
</p>
<p>could not straightforwardly capitalise on this track record in China as it could else-
</p>
<p>where. Risk mitigation in emerging markets needs to be very much locally 
</p>
<p>tailored.
</p>
<p>Chapter 5: INEOS ChlorVinyls (A): A Positive Vision for PVC by N.&nbsp;Craig 
</p>
<p>Smith and Dawn Jarisch
</p>
<p>This risk management case is particularly interesting from a number of perspec-
</p>
<p>tives. First come the risks associated with a product and a production process with 
</p>
<p>considerable alleged hazardous impacts. Responding to NGO pressures and miti-
</p>
<p>gating EU regulatory risks was key in the first phase. External relations manage-
</p>
<p>ment and internal change management were quite good. But getting the rest of the 
</p>
<p>industry to join in to mitigate the risks of looming cost disadvantages is key in a 
</p>
<p>second phase. However, embarking on a high quality sustainability journey creates 
</p>
<p>new global risks, especially if Chinese producers enter the global market without 
</p>
<p>adopting high standards, and global trade agreements prevent European regulators 
</p>
<p>from imposing tariffs on low quality market entrants.

<p>1The Scenario Approach to&nbsp;Possible Futures for&nbsp;Oil and&nbsp;Natural Gas
Jeremy&nbsp;Bentham
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>From blackouts around the globe to the boiling tensions in the Middle East, recent 
</p>
<p>events have thrown up many uncertainties about how the world will meet its grow-
</p>
<p>ing future energy needs. While these dramatic events have grabbed the headlines, 
</p>
<p>they come on top of several relentless trends that have been shaping our global 
</p>
<p>energy future.
</p>
<p>The worldwide financial crisis ushered in an era of macro-economic volatility 
</p>
<p>and accelerated the shift in influence from West to East. As wealth levels rise in the 
</p>
<p>emerging economies, hundreds of millions of people are emerging from poverty. 
</p>
<p>And the global population, which is growing by more than 200,000 people every 
</p>
<p>day is projected to reach over nine billion by 2050.1 That is like adding one more 
</p>
<p>China and India to the world, with basic needs for food, water, and energy that will 
</p>
<p>have to be met.
</p>
<p>At the same time, many countries are making the journey from rural to urban 
</p>
<p>societies. According to one projection, the world will build the equivalent of one 
</p>
<p>new city of 1.3 million people every week for the next 40&nbsp;years.2
</p>
<p>The upshot of these trends? Surging energy demand and growing environmental 
</p>
<p>stress. If we continue to use energy in the same ways we do today, global energy 
</p>
<p>needs could triple in the first half of this century. At the same time, many scientists 
</p>
<p>agree that CO2 emissions must be halved by mid-century if we are to avoid danger-
</p>
<p>ous changes to the global climate.
</p>
<p>Of course, over the coming decades we will surely find creative ways to improve 
</p>
<p>the energy efficiency of our cars, homes, and factories. And technology will help us

</p>
<p>unlock additional sources of energy. But those gains still may not be enough to keep 
</p>
<p>up with the pace of underlying demand growth.
</p>
<p>Closing this gap in energy supply and demand will require a dramatic ramp-up 
</p>
<p>in energy production or a drastic moderation in energy use&nbsp;&ndash; or, more likely, some 
</p>
<p>mix of both. But just how this might be achieved remains unclear, giving rise to a 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;zone of uncertainty&rsquo;.3 This could turn out to be a zone of extraordinary misery or 
</p>
<p>extraordinary opportunity, depending on how the world responds.
</p>
<p>For over four decades, Shell has developed and applied scenarios as part of its 
</p>
<p>strategic thinking to help grapple with such uncertainties. Most companies monitor 
</p>
<p>changes in their business environment, but Shell is one of the few that routinely 
</p>
<p>employs alternative outlooks as a core strategic tool. Given the long lifetimes of 
</p>
<p>investments in the energy industry, decisions made today have consequences for 
</p>
<p>decades. Long-term scenario considerations are helpful in shaping those decisions.
</p>
<p>The success of the scenarios is not just their ability to provide strategic insights, 
</p>
<p>but their approach to developing and sharing these insights. They enable the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s decision-makers to think about the possible wider and longer-reaching 
</p>
<p>implications of unfolding trends and potential discontinuities. They stretch and 
</p>
<p>clarify thinking, helping to improve the company&rsquo;s prospects, not only through 
</p>
<p>enriching the context for decision-making, but also by developing a leadership 
</p>
<p>cadre that is more sensitive to changes in the external environment.
</p>
<p> Scenarios in&nbsp;Shell
</p>
<p>From the outset of the practice in the company, scenario developers embraced intu-
</p>
<p>ition, uncertainty, and engagement. They did not shy away from talking about what 
</p>
<p>could be considered &lsquo;unimaginable&rsquo;. Producing neither rigid predictions nor wild 
</p>
<p>fantasies, scenario building is a craft that holds real commercial value for Shell.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we can&rsquo;t predict the future, science-based creative thinking can give us 
</p>
<p>some clues,&rdquo; says Dr. Angela Wilkinson, from the Smith School of Enterprise and 
</p>
<p>the Environment at Oxford University.
</p>
<p>Shell&rsquo;s scenario analysis focuses on four main areas&nbsp;&ndash; economics, (geo)politics 
</p>
<p>and socio-cultural issues, energy, and the environment&nbsp;&ndash; to understand how consum-
</p>
<p>ers, governments, oil energy producers, and regulators are likely to behave and 
</p>
<p>respond to change in the decades ahead.
</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s scenario builders use complex econometric modeling and sophisticated 
</p>
<p>methodologies. The scenarios development process now includes a multitude of 
</p>
<p>short-, medium-, and long-term portraits of global energy developments, but also 
</p>
<p>individual country analyses and consideration of major trends in areas like public 
</p>
<p>health and urbanisation. Scenarios can take a global view or focus on specific issues 
</p>
<p>in specific countries, such as the future for the emerging democracies of Libya or 
</p>
<p>Iraq. They often look decades ahead, but can also have a shorter-term focus, such as 
</p>
<p>with the financial crisis in the Eurozone.

</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of scenarios for Shell is to encourage and equip business decision- 
</p>
<p>makers to consider the factors that shape their choices right now. That is important for 
</p>
<p>an industry investing billion-dollar sums in infrastructure which can operate for 
</p>
<p>decades. Today scenarios continue to influence thinking across the company, from the 
</p>
<p>Board and Executive Committee right across the operating businesses.
</p>
<p>Many important strategic decisions taken over the last four decades have the 
</p>
<p>fingerprints of scenario activity on them. Of course, all major choices involve mul-
</p>
<p>tiple inputs from many people, but scenarios have explicitly highlighted specific 
</p>
<p>threats and opportunities or, more frequently, implicitly informed the fundamental 
</p>
<p>mind-sets underpinning decisions.
</p>
<p>Scenarios under discussion in 1973 first established Shell&rsquo;s reputation for using 
</p>
<p>this hitherto academic approach to inform strategic business planning. When the 
</p>
<p>Yom Kippur War broke out in October of that year, the West&rsquo;s support for Israel 
</p>
<p>angered oil-rich Arab states, triggering an oil embargo. Fuel shortages sparked a 
</p>
<p>global recession and a massive stock market crash. The world reeled. But Shell&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>decision makers were mentally prepared for the worst because they had already 
</p>
<p>imagined such a scenario. This helped the company weather the volatility of the 
</p>
<p>1970s, bringing financial gains running into the billions of dollars thanks to the re- 
</p>
<p>configuration or sale of refineries and installations, or decisions not to replace them.
</p>
<p>Scenarios contribution to strategic thinking helped the company to anticipate, 
</p>
<p>adapt, and respond to another oil shock in 1979, as well as to the decline and even-
</p>
<p>tual collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. It also prepared the company for the 
</p>
<p>rise of environmental concerns linked to carbon dioxide in the 1990s and to explore 
</p>
<p>the dynamics of recession and recovery in the 2000s. In the past two decades, sce-
</p>
<p>narios prepared the company for the impact of technology, terrorism, and globalisa-
</p>
<p>tion in a rapidly changing world.
</p>
<p>Long before the collapse of the Berlin wall in 1989, scenarios workshops had 
</p>
<p>imagined potential new opportunities in new markets opening up behind the old Iron 
</p>
<p>Curtain&nbsp;&ndash; not only in the Soviet Union, but also across Eastern Europe. Shell not only 
</p>
<p>opened refineries in Eastern Europe, it closed down or sold some in Western Europe.
</p>
<p>In the 1990s, growing social and environmental stresses were highlighted, help-
</p>
<p>ing Shell develop a constructive, pro-active attitude to the threat of climate change.
</p>
<p>In 2005, scenarios also raised the probability of a looming gap between the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s surging demand for energy and global supplies and reinforced the signifi-
</p>
<p>cance of natural gas in the company&rsquo;s energy mix.
</p>
<p>A few years later they highlighted a mix of circumstances that made sustainable 
</p>
<p>biofuels appear to be an attractive business opportunity. In 2011, Shell moved into 
</p>
<p>the production of low-carbon bio-ethanol from Brazilian sugar cane.
</p>
<p>In Shell&rsquo;s 2011 Signals &amp; Signposts publication, one of the key factors raised was 
</p>
<p>the impact of heightened political tension in the developing world. In early 2011, the 
</p>
<p>Arab Spring took the world by surprise with popular revolts toppling rulers in Egypt 
</p>
<p>and Tunisia and sowing the seeds for reform throughout the Middle East.
</p>
<p>While scenarios couldn&rsquo;t, of course, predict the exact date of the uprising in the 
</p>
<p>Middle East and North Africa, they had highlighted conditions that would make the 
</p>
<p>rebellions increasingly likely: growing resentment, youthful populations with little

</p>
<p>opportunity for employment, economic volatility, and rising unemployment and 
</p>
<p>inflation.
</p>
<p>Shell has shared at least half a dozen far-reaching global scenarios with the wider 
</p>
<p>world since the 1990s, probing the impact of profound developments like the fall of 
</p>
<p>the Iron Curtain and the war in Iraq, as well as the evolution of alternative energy 
</p>
<p>resources like biofuels, shale gas, and wind, solar, and other renewable energy 
</p>
<p>resources. In 2013, a summary of recent work entitled New Lens Scenarios was

<p>Drawing on the knowledge of a network of specialists&nbsp;&ndash; both within and outside the 
</p>
<p>company&nbsp;&ndash; is central to the process of building scenarios. But engaging the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s own decision-executives throughout the development process is vital to sce-
</p>
<p>narios&rsquo; impact.
</p>
<p>Scenarios provide quantified insights and a language for executives to apply 
</p>
<p>when grappling with increasingly unfamiliar and challenging conditions. They aim 
</p>
<p>to be thought-provoking yet plausible, highlighting matters already in the fore-
</p>
<p>ground and also, crucially, background developments that should be brought to the 
</p>
<p>fore. Used effectively, these alternative outlooks can help organisations address dif-
</p>
<p>ficult issues that need to be explored collaboratively even though there may be 
</p>
<p>deeply divided opinions about them.
</p>
<p>Such an approach also helps equip decision-makers with a deeper awareness of 
</p>
<p>the very different perspectives others may have, the need to engage with these per-
</p>
<p>spectives effectively, and the significance to their own future of the choices made by 
</p>
<p>others. In that sense, scenarios are deeply relational as they focus on people and 
</p>
<p>their behaviour, and not only on seemingly impersonal economic, political, and 
</p>
<p>social forces.
</p>
<p>The scenario alchemy as we experience it in Shell is a combination of a strategic 
</p>
<p>thinking process, a mode of analysis, a social process of engagement and influence, 
</p>
<p>and, at its most powerful, an enabler of individual and group exploration and 
</p>
<p>discovery.
</p>
<p>At least one of the functions of scenario work is to bring people together to 
</p>
<p>explore areas in a way that may reveal &lsquo;unknown unknowns,&rsquo; in the words of former 
</p>
<p>US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. This exploration is not primarily 
</p>
<p>intended to produce attractive booklets or reports, nice though those can be. It is 
</p>
<p>most importantly about helping people take a journey that guides them into better 
</p>
<p>choices based on richer considerations of the world around them.
</p>
<p>This journey can be difficult. As the philosopher Schopenhauer pointed out, new 
</p>
<p>truths are first ignored or ridiculed, then vehemently opposed, and then, ultimately, 
</p>
<p>taken to be self evident&nbsp;&ndash; so at different points specific scenarios may be considered 
</p>
<p>irrelevant, foolish, irritating, or even unnecessary. Nevertheless, experience in Shell 
</p>
<p>has deepened our belief of the value to our company of taking this journey.

</p>
<p>The journey is never simple or linear. Fresh insights are rarely absorbed from a 
</p>
<p>single reading of a report or from attending a presentation&nbsp;&ndash; no matter how brilliant. 
</p>
<p>Understanding this fact helps to avoid the disappointing fate of scenario approaches 
</p>
<p>that are separate from the central strategic deliberations of an organization. While 
</p>
<p>such deliberations are generally embedded in a formal strategic process, much 
</p>
<p>reflection and influence also occurs through parallel channels. In Shell, scenario 
</p>
<p>activity is intrinsically bound up with ongoing assessment of economic, political, 
</p>
<p>and market signals, and the strategic conversations that take place around these. 
</p>
<p>Hundreds of conversations, often informal, with decision-executives over many 
</p>
<p>months prepare fertile ground for the crystallization of insights into scenarios, and 
</p>
<p>also shape the understanding of how scenarios can be best shaped to be impactful.
</p>
<p> The Energy Outlook and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Zone of&nbsp;Uncertainty
</p>
<p>As an energy company, developments affecting this industry will always be a cen-
</p>
<p>tral concern of Shell scenarios. Our energy modeling looks at over 80 individual 
</p>
<p>countries, with regions to cover the smaller countries, and 14 different sectors of 
</p>
<p>energy demand within each country. Analysis suggests that underlying global 
</p>
<p>demand for energy by 2050 would triple from its 2000 level if emerging economies 
</p>
<p>follow historical patterns of development and if there were no supply constraints.
</p>
<p>Natural innovation and competition could spur improvements in energy effi-
</p>
<p>ciency to help moderate underlying demand by about 20% over this time. Ordinary 
</p>
<p>rates of supply growth&nbsp;&ndash; taking into account technological, geological, competitive, 
</p>
<p>financial, and political realities&nbsp;&ndash; could naturally boost energy production by about 
</p>
<p>50%. But this still leaves a gap between business-as-usual supply and business-as- 
</p>
<p>usual demand equal to approximately the size of the whole industry in 2000.
</p>
<p>This gap&nbsp;&ndash; this Zone of Uncertainty&nbsp;&ndash; will have to be bridged by some combina-
</p>
<p>tion of extraordinary demand moderation and extraordinary production acceleration. 
</p>
<p>So, we must ask: Is this a zone of extraordinary opportunity or extraordinary misery? 
</p>
<p>For example, smart urban development, sustained policy encouragement and com-
</p>
<p>mercial and technological innovation can all result in some moderation. But so can 
</p>
<p>price-shocks, knee-jerk policies, and frustrated economic aspirations (Chart 1.1).
</p>
<p>Timescales are a key factor. Buildings, infrastructure, and power stations last 
</p>
<p>several decades. The stock of vehicles can last a couple of decades. New energy 
</p>
<p>technologies must be demonstrated at commercial scale and require three decades 
</p>
<p>of sustained double-digit growth to build industrial capacity and grow sufficiently to 
</p>
<p>feature at even 1&ndash;2% of the energy system.
</p>
<p>The policies and possibilities in place in the next 5&nbsp;years will shape investment 
</p>
<p>for the next 10&nbsp;years, which will largely shape the global energy picture out to 2050. 
</p>
<p>How fast will tensions rise? How fast can we make the right choices, and how 
</p>
<p>quickly can positive developments happen?
</p>
<p>In considering these questions, previously published Shell scenario work has 
</p>
<p>highlighted our entry into an era of volatility and transition&nbsp;&ndash; economically, politi-
</p>
<p>cally, socially, and within the energy and environmental systems:

</p>
<p>&bull; Intensified economic cycles as the conditions have changed that underpinned the 
</p>
<p>period from the mid 1980s to mid 2000s&nbsp;&ndash; referred to as &lsquo;the great moderation&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>in the advanced industrial economies.
</p>
<p>&bull; Heightened political and social instability, stimulated in part by economic 
</p>
<p>volatility.
</p>
<p>&bull; Tensions in the international order, as multilateral institutions struggle to adjust 
</p>
<p>to shifts in economic power, and other arrangements proliferate.
</p>
<p>&bull; Significant demographic transitions involving ageing populations in some places, 
</p>
<p>youth bulges in others, and relentless urbanisation in both fast-emerging and 
</p>
<p>less-developed economies.
</p>
<p>&bull; Surging energy demand driven by growing populations and prosperity, with new 
</p>
<p>energy supplies emerging while others struggle to keep pace, and greenhouse gas 
</p>
<p>emissions increasing, particularly from growth in coal consumption.
</p>
<p>&bull; The deployment of technological advances enabling rapid growth in resource 
</p>
<p>plays such as shale gas and liquid rich shales in, for example, North America, 
</p>
<p>with ripples across the globe, but uncertain prospects elsewhere. The technology 
</p>
<p>for using renewable resources, such as solar photovoltaic, also advances with 
</p>
<p>rapidly growing supply from a small but established base.
</p>
<p>&bull; Better defined and significantly challenged planetary ecological boundaries, 
</p>
<p>including pressures arising from the energy-water-food &lsquo;Stress Nexus&rsquo;, as each 
</p>
<p>component experiences supply/demand tightness. Because of their linkages, 
</p>
<p>these resources feed off each other and accelerate the combined growth in stress.

</p>
<p> New Lenses
</p>
<p>Inevitably, given these developments, any plausible outlooks will be messy and 
</p>
<p>patchy. Nevertheless, we have found that a number of new lenses can help us view 
</p>
<p>familiar landscapes from fresh angles so that we can focus and clarify possible 
</p>
<p>futures.
</p>
<p> The Paradox Lenses
</p>
<p>Paradoxes embody tensions. Three paradoxes highlight key features of the emerg-
</p>
<p>ing landscape.
</p>
<p>The Prosperity Paradox&nbsp; &ndash; Economic development raises living standards, but 
</p>
<p>also imposes environmental, resource, financial, political, and social stresses that 
</p>
<p>can undermine the benefits of prosperity. Globalisation reduces income inequality 
</p>
<p>between nations while increasing inequalities within them.
</p>
<p>The Leadership Paradox &ndash; Addressing global stresses requires coordination 
</p>
<p>among increasing numbers of constituencies, but the more groups involved, the 
</p>
<p>more vested interests block progress. Fresh forms of collaboration need to cut across 
</p>
<p>familiar national, public-private, and industry-sector boundaries, but there are no 
</p>
<p>strong models for such collaborations, and they are difficult to get off the ground as 
</p>
<p>different parties remain focussed on their individual responsibilities.
</p>
<p>The Connectivity Paradox &ndash; Growing connectivity stimulates creativity but also 
</p>
<p>puts intellectual property at risk, threatening creativity. Connectivity facilitates indi-
</p>
<p>vidual expression and empowerment, but also encourages herd behaviour and 
</p>
<p>amplifies swings in confidence and demand.
</p>
<p> Two Archetypal Pathway Lenses
</p>
<p>The tensions inherent in these paradoxes fuel an emerging era of transitions. 
</p>
<p>Through examining a range of historical transformations and various models of 
</p>
<p>transition, two archetypal &lsquo;Pathway Lenses&rsquo; may help bring clarity and insights to 
</p>
<p>current circumstances.
</p>
<p>For example, countries around the world face challenges to their current economic 
</p>
<p>models, political regimes, and social arrangements. The US is dealing with a long 
</p>
<p>term decline in relative global power, economic recession, and a deadlocked political 
</p>
<p>system. China and the other large emerging economies, which appeared resilient in 
</p>
<p>2008, are now grappling with a range of uncertainties in their search for stability and 
</p>
<p>continued growth. Europe appears to be postponing the challenge of fundamental 
</p>
<p>reform, &ldquo;kicking the can down the road.&rdquo; Countries face divergent paths. Will they 
</p>
<p>respond to the challenges they face through adaptation and reform, following a Room 
</p>
<p>to Manoeuvre pathway? Or will change be postponed and a Trapped Transition path-
</p>
<p>way ensue, until there is either a fundamental reset or collapse?
</p>
<p>1 The Scenario Approach to&nbsp;Possible Futures for&nbsp;Oil and&nbsp;Natural Gas</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12
</p>
<p> New Lens Scenarios for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Twenty-First Century
</p>
<p>Of course, not all countries or actors will follow one single Trapped Transition or 
</p>
<p>Room to Manoeuvre pathway. Nevertheless, the pathway lenses highlight patterns 
</p>
<p>recurring throughout the broader panorama.
</p>
<p>Of particular prominence is the crucial relationship between those who are more 
</p>
<p>or less privileged under current arrangements, and the influence this will have on 
</p>
<p>future developments. In fast-emerging nations, a growing middle class will make 
</p>
<p>increasing demands on governance and welfare entitlements. In developed coun-
</p>
<p>tries, we see globalisation &lsquo;hollowing out&rsquo; the middle class as average household 
</p>
<p>incomes stagnate while the top tier prospers. In global geopolitics, there are grow-
</p>
<p>ing tensions between established and emerging powers, within an increasingly inad-
</p>
<p>equate multilateral institutional structure.
</p>
<p>Two vistas present themselves&nbsp;&ndash; high Mountains where the benefits of an ele-
</p>
<p>vated position are exercised and protected, and wide Oceans with rising tides, strong 
</p>
<p>currents, and a churning of established perspectives for new ones. A detailed evalu-
</p>
<p>ation of these scenarios has been published elsewhere (www.shell.com/scenarios) 
</p>
<p>and a summary of key features follows.
</p>
<p>Mountains &ndash; an outlook in which current advantages and influence lock-in fur-
</p>
<p>ther future influence, and concentrate prevailing power, benefiting the already 
</p>
<p>advantaged.
</p>
<p>Latent opposition is minimised through a combination of &lsquo;carrots and sticks&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>Supply-side investments are stimulated, and philanthropy flourishes. But growing 
</p>
<p>rigidities and a lack of structural adjustment begin to moderate economic develop-
</p>
<p>ment and even limit international trade. Some fast-emerging economies fall into the 
</p>
<p>middle-income trap, ratcheting up social and political stresses.
</p>
<p>The moderation of economic growth takes some pressure off energy demand, 
</p>
<p>and this looser supply/demand boundary can be pushed further if progress is made 
</p>
<p>with supply-side energy policies that unlock resources.
</p>
<p>New shale and tight gas resources enjoy widespread success and grow to form a 
</p>
<p>new &lsquo;gas backbone&rsquo; to the global energy system. Major oil resource holders fear 
</p>
<p>market loss, and some face severe political/social stresses in periods of modest 
</p>
<p>prices. Supply-side incentives, the abundance of gas, and policies that encourage 
</p>
<p>smarter compact city development open the route to transport electrification and 
</p>
<p>enable hydrogen infrastructure to be developed for storage and transport of energy 
</p>
<p>from intermittent or remote renewables. Oil prices remain elevated and volatile, but 
</p>
<p>grow only modestly, and global gas pricing emerges due to high levels of liquidity 
</p>
<p>and inter-regional transport.
</p>
<p>Sluggish economic growth in the early period, the relative displacement of coal 
</p>
<p>growth by gas over the longer term, and the incentivisation of carbon capture and 
</p>
<p>storage (CCS), all contribute to a moderation in greenhouse gas emissions. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these still remain consistent with a global average temperature rise in 
</p>
<p>excess of 2&nbsp;&deg;C aspirations over the longer term. By the end of the century, however, 
</p>
<p>there is the potential for net zero annual emissions from the energy sector, and even 
</p>
<p>net negative emissions as the result of the contribution of CCS with a proportion of

<p>13
</p>
<p>biomass feedstock. This opens the longer-term prospect that the cumulative build-
</p>
<p> up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere may overshoot aspirations but 
</p>
<p>could then be repaired (Chart 1.2).
</p>
<p>Oceans &ndash; an outlook in which there is greater accommodation of competing 
</p>
<p>interests and broader diffusion of influence.
</p>
<p>At first, economic pressures strain social cohesion, forcing changes in economic 
</p>
<p>and political structures. A refreshed philosophical narrative of &lsquo;accommodation&rsquo; or 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;social coherence&rsquo; arises, consistent with reforms to welfare and other social struc-
</p>
<p>tures. Productivity is boosted, as is catch-up growth by developing countries. An 
</p>
<p>ethos of accommodation and compromise promotes growing aspirations and rising 
</p>
<p>confidence, reinforcing pressures for continuing reform and for further 
</p>
<p>accommodation.
</p>
<p>Globalisation strengthens, and the key emerging economies move to more bal-
</p>
<p>anced growth. But over time, the &lsquo;newly advantaged&rsquo; eventually become more 
</p>
<p>defensive, even reactionary, when faced with new policy choices and the impact of 
</p>
<p>rapidly rising resource and social stresses further ahead.
</p>
<p>With emerging economies continuing to surge and boost energy demand, this 
</p>
<p>tighter supply/demand boundary can be pushed further if energy policies lag on the 
</p>
<p>supply side&nbsp; &ndash; partly due to newly empowered populist sentiment&nbsp; &ndash; and some 
</p>
<p>resource developments ultimately disappoint.

</p>
<p>Scenarios and the &lsquo;Stress Nexus&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Over the next couple of decades global demand for energy, water and 
</p>
<p>food is expected to increase by between 30% and 50%1, placing growing 
</p>
<p>pressure on supplies of these vital resources and the environment. In 
</p>
<p>recent years, the Shell scenarios team, together with academics and other 
</p>
<p>organisations, has researched the complex relationships between these 
</p>
<p>interdependent systems. The work has yielded important insights and 
</p>
<p>influenced both the way Shell runs its own operations and how it works 
</p>
<p>and engages with others to address these issues.
</p>
<p>Water is essential to the energy industry. It is used in various stages of oil 
</p>
<p>and gas extraction as well as to cool power plants. In 2009, the scenarios team 
</p>
<p>started to take a close look at the growing challenge of water scarcity in many 
</p>
<p>regions of the world and how it might affect operations and potential 
</p>
<p>investments.
</p>
<p>Whilst identifying likely hotspots where limited water supplies and energy 
</p>
<p>demand might overlap, the team became increasingly interested in the com-
</p>
<p>plex interactions water has with other dynamic systems: water is used to 
</p>
<p>extract energy and generate power, energy is used to purify, distribute and 
</p>
<p>treat water and wastewater; and both energy and water are essential to the 
</p>
<p>growth and processing of food. If there is stress on one of the three, it has an 
</p>
<p>effect on the other two&nbsp;&ndash; a relationship that Shell called the &lsquo;Stress Nexus&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>This early work caught the attention of Shell&rsquo;s then CEO Peter Voser, who 
</p>
<p>recognised its strategic significance and sponsored a dedicated group of spe-
</p>
<p>cialists from the fields of energy, water, food and climate to conduct further 
</p>
<p>research. Working with Dr. Eric Berlow, an expert in complexity science at 
</p>
<p>the University of California, Berkeley, they mapped many thousands of inter-
</p>
<p>actions and identified over 100 of the most significant factors, ranging from 
</p>
<p>how bio mass resources are used, to the price variability of food, to technol-
</p>
<p>ogy innovation in water efficiency.
</p>
<p>As a result of this work, water has become an increasingly important con-
</p>
<p>sideration for Shell and the company has taken further steps to manage its 
</p>
<p>water footprint effectively. There are numerous illustrations of how this has 
</p>
<p>translated directly into the way Shell operates.
</p>
<p>At Shell&rsquo;s major facilities, water management plans are in place, helping 
</p>
<p>minimise water use where necessary. At Shell&rsquo;s Groundbirch &lsquo;tight gas&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>development project in Canada, for example, Shell has worked with the com-
</p>
<p>munity to find ways to reduce the amount of fresh water that is used from 
</p>
<p>local sources. The project recycles some 75% of water involved in the extrac-
</p>
<p>tion process. Shell draws the remainder of the water required from a reclama-
</p>
<p>tion facility which it funded and operates with the local council. The plant 
</p>
<p>treats the community&rsquo;s waste water to a standard suitable for industrial and 
</p>
<p>municipal uses.

</p>
<p>Shale and tight gas performance outside North America disappoint as a result of 
</p>
<p>lower resource development than anticipated and policy delays, and growth in oil 
</p>
<p>production from some major resource holders is constrained in the early period as 
</p>
<p>leadership transitions take their toll. This is a particularly high oil-price world which 
</p>
<p>economically unlocks new high-cost resources and technological opportunities and 
</p>
<p>invokes a &lsquo;long liquid fuels game&rsquo;. Global gas volume growth is steady but more 
</p>
<p>In 2011, Shell partnered with the University of Utrecht to develop a new 
</p>
<p>accounting methodology to improve the measurement of water use. Shell can 
</p>
<p>now estimate more accurately the amount of water needed to generate energy 
</p>
<p>from different sources&nbsp;&ndash; including oil, gas, coal, nuclear and biofuels&nbsp;&ndash; using 
</p>
<p>different technologies in different locations. The findings were published in 
</p>
<p>2012&nbsp;in a peer reviewed Elsevier academic journal titled &ldquo;Water accounting 
</p>
<p>for (agro) industrial operations and its application to energy pathways&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Shell has used this data to extend its proprietary &lsquo;World Energy Model&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>that is used for scenario planning. This gives a better understanding of the 
</p>
<p>demands the global energy system will place on water resources in decades 
</p>
<p>ahead, and support strategic planning for operations. It also shared this data 
</p>
<p>with the wider business community through the World Business Council for 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development and with the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
</p>
<p>The IEA used the data and findings in &ldquo;The World Energy Outlook 2012&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The work helped Shell recognise that strong cross&nbsp;&ndash; sector collaboration is 
</p>
<p>needed to achieve meaningful solutions to improving Shell&rsquo;s own water use 
</p>
<p>and preparing for future water challenges. Shell is currently working with 
</p>
<p>Veolia&nbsp;&ndash; a leading multinational specialising in waste, water, and energy man-
</p>
<p>agement operations&nbsp;&ndash; to explore new water management solutions and busi-
</p>
<p>ness opportunities. For example, by combining expertise to extract and treat 
</p>
<p>water from sewage systems and use it to cool power plants, and taking the 
</p>
<p>waste steam from power plants and using it to heat nearby industrial zones. 
</p>
<p>And together they are further developing the water accounting methodology 
</p>
<p>by doing a comparative water risk assessment pilot at various Shell projects 
</p>
<p>including in Canada and China.
</p>
<p>Of course, as a shared resource, effective national and international policy 
</p>
<p>is key to ensuring sustainable water resources are available for both the energy 
</p>
<p>and agricultural sector. With its greater understanding of the complexity of the 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stress Nexus&rsquo;, Shell has been able to engage governments and local stake-
</p>
<p>holders to encourage strategic water management plans are put in place. This 
</p>
<p>is essential for Shell&rsquo;s business, and also the broader community. There is 
</p>
<p>great opportunity to create social and commercial value through the invest-
</p>
<p>ments required to meet the &lsquo;Stress Nexus&rsquo; challenges.

</p>
<p>modest than anticipated, and prices remain regionalized but strong where there is 
</p>
<p>relative scarcity.
</p>
<p>As a result of strong growth in coal consumption and the extension of the oil age, 
</p>
<p>resource stresses become severe, and prices plus crises eventually stimulate strong 
</p>
<p>demand-side investment to increase end-user efficiency. Stimulated by higher 
</p>
<p>energy prices, renewable energy also grows, and by the 2060s solar becomes the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s largest primary energy source. Nevertheless, greenhouse gas emissions fol-
</p>
<p>low a pathway towards a high degree of climate change, ocean acidification, and the 
</p>
<p>need for significant adaptation. As the impact of delays in responding to resource 
</p>
<p>stresses becomes apparent, there are eventually late and urgent moves to deploy 
</p>
<p>CCS at scale. In combination with the growth in solar energy and biofuels, this 
</p>
<p>enables net zero CO2 emissions from energy to be approached by the end of the 
</p>
<p>century (Chart 1.3).
</p>
<p> Reflections
</p>
<p>Each of these scenarios has different political, economic and social trajectories, 
</p>
<p>with different central patterns and counter-currents. Interestingly, overall energy 
</p>
<p>consumption is relatively similar, although there are significant differences in the 
</p>
<p>mix of resources, the price trajectories, sector-level specifics, and levels of resource 
</p>
<p>stress. Total global energy consumption by 2050 is some 80% higher than today, 
</p>
<p>with the underlying upward pressure on demand due to stronger economic growth 
</p>
<p>in Oceans offset to a large extent by higher prices.
</p>
<p>Both scenarios exhibit extraordinary moderation of demand growth and extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary acceleration of supply&nbsp;&ndash; both of which, as was previously noted, would be 
</p>
<p>necessary to bridge the Zone of Uncertainty. In Mountains, demand moderation

</p>
<p>and end-user efficiencies. On the energy production side, the main contribution to 
</p>
<p>acceleration in Mountains is the global extension of North America&rsquo;s ongoing shale 
</p>
<p>and tight gas revolution, while in Oceans this occurs through growth in enhanced oil 
</p>
<p>recovery, biofuels, and other frontier developments, as well as solar eventually 
</p>
<p>growing to become the single largest primary energy source.
</p>
<p>In fact, both scenarios witness a shift in the largest global primary energy source 
</p>
<p>in the decades ahead. In Mountains, natural gas becomes the largest source in the 
</p>
<p>2030s, ending a 70-year reign for oil. Before that, coal&rsquo;s reign as the number one 
</p>
<p>global energy source had lasted around 50&nbsp;years (circa 1910&ndash;1960), taking over 
</p>
<p>from traditional sources of biomass like wood, peat, dung, and agricultural waste. In 
</p>
<p>Oceans, solar becomes the largest source by the 2070s (Fig.&nbsp;1.1).
</p>
<p> Concluding Remarks
</p>
<p>Shell&rsquo;s New Lens Scenarios suggest that addressing the challenges of the twenty- 
</p>
<p>first century will be difficult and often uncomfortable. It may require many people 
</p>
<p>and organisations to reconsider their own vested interests, to forge innovative part-
</p>
<p>nerships, and to move towards more effectively accommodating the interests of 
</p>
<p>others as a necessary component of their own flourishing.
</p>
<p>The scenario approach encourages decision-makers to explore the features, 
</p>
<p>uncertainties, and boundaries of the future landscape, and engage with alternative 
</p>
<p>points of view. For example, it is becoming clearer that a prosperous and sustainable 
</p>
<p>global outlook must encompass both energy-efficient infrastructures like compact 
</p>
<p>cities as well as efficient end-use in vehicles and buildings. Similarly, a prosperous 
</p>
<p>and sustainable outlook requires both cleaner fossil fuels and also a revolution in 
</p>
<p>renewable energy as well. A &lsquo;both/and&rsquo; rather than an &lsquo;either/or&rsquo; attitude is required 
</p>
<p>in policy making.
</p>
<p>Although, of course, there needs to be a sensible understanding of the pros and 
</p>
<p>cons of both approaches, the true battle is against time. Every year that passes sees,

</p>
<p>for example, strong growth in coal burning and the ratcheting upwards of cumula-
</p>
<p>tive greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The pace at which CCS tech-
</p>
<p>nology is deployed at scale and at which natural gas substitutes for coal growth is 
</p>
<p>the main driver of difference between cumulative emissions in the Mountains and 
</p>
<p>Oceans scenarios. If it were possible to accelerate these developments even more 
</p>
<p>than described in the Mountains scenario, the cumulative emissions for the twenty-
</p>
<p>first century would be closer to a level consistent with containing global average 
</p>
<p>temperature rise to 2&nbsp;&deg;C.
</p>
<p>The scenarios highlight many opportunities, but they also underline the complex-
</p>
<p>ity and urgency of resource stresses. Technology deployment is important, but polit-
</p>
<p>ical and societal choices are as influential as resources and technology. Both 
</p>
<p>scenarios have positive and troubling features. The challenge is to see if it is some-
</p>
<p>how possible to deliver the best of both worlds.
</p>
<p>Achieving a greater balance of positive features in the future depends on the 
</p>
<p>capacity of business, government, and civil society to work more effectively together. 
</p>
<p>Beyond its value within individual organisations, working with scenarios can play a 
</p>
<p>constructive role in supporting the cross-sector dialogue necessary for this.

<p>2Beyond BP: The Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon Disaster 2010
David Grayson
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>On April 20th 2010, an explosion occurred on the Deepwater Horizon&nbsp;&ndash; an oil rig 
</p>
<p>operated on behalf of BP, in the Gulf of Mexico, 40&nbsp;miles from the coastline of the 
</p>
<p>American state of Louisiana. The explosion killed 11 workers and oil started pour-
</p>
<p>ing from the Macondo well-head, 5000&nbsp;ft beneath the surface of the sea. It was to 
</p>
<p>become the worst oil spill the USA had experienced with the escape of oil being the 
</p>
<p>equivalent of an Exxon Valdez incident every 4&nbsp;days. By June, President Obama 
</p>
<p>was describing it as &ldquo;the worst environmental disaster in US history.&rdquo; The BP CEO 
</p>
<p>Tony Hayward who had taken personal charge of BP&rsquo;s efforts to contain the disaster 
</p>
<p>was vilified in Congress and the media as &ldquo;the most hated man in America&rdquo; and was 
</p>
<p>later to resign over the incident. At one stage, BP&rsquo;s share price was halved from its 
</p>
<p>peak immediately before the explosion, and there was serious business media spec-
</p>
<p>ulation about whether the company could survive without being taken over. The 
</p>
<p>situation was complicated because although BP owned a majority stake in the well, 
</p>
<p>and was the &ldquo;responsible operator&rdquo; for the US authorities, another company: 
</p>
<p>Transocean, operated the drilling rig; a third: Halliburton, cemented around the well 
</p>
<p>pipe; and a fourth: Cameron, made the blow-out preventer on the rig, which was 
</p>
<p>meant to shut off the well in an emergency, but failed to do so. President Obama was 
</p>
<p>later to say: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough responsibility to go around, and all parties should be 
</p>
<p>willing to accept it. That includes, by the way, the federal government.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>For BP, it was the latest in a series of significant incidents in BP&rsquo;s North American 
</p>
<p>operations such as the fatal accident at BP&rsquo;s Texas City Refinery in 20051 and a

</p>
<p>major leak in Prudhoe Bay Alaska (see extracts of a speech by the then CEO of BP 
</p>
<p>Tony Hayward at Stanford Business School in July 2009&nbsp;&ndash; Appendix 1). The Gulf 
</p>
<p>of Mexico incident was quickly dubbed BP&rsquo;s Brent Spar moment or a second Exxon 
</p>
<p>Valdez. Some commentators called it Obama&rsquo;s Katrina (after Hurricane Katrina, the 
</p>
<p>mishandling of which caused massive damage to the standing of the previous, Bush 
</p>
<p>administration).
</p>
<p> Context
</p>
<p>The Deepwater Horizon drilling platform was one of more than 3500&nbsp;in the Gulf of 
</p>
<p>Mexico alone&nbsp;&ndash; but as of 2008, only 36 were for deep-drilling below the sea-bed. 
</p>
<p>There were only three in 1992 and drilling in deepwater (depths greater than 1000&nbsp;ft) 
</p>
<p>and ultra-deepwater (depths of 5000&nbsp; ft or more) had only started becoming eco-
</p>
<p>nomically profitable and technically feasible on a large scale in the previous decade, 
</p>
<p>in part due to significantly higher oil prices and a US push for &ldquo;energy independence.&rdquo;2 
</p>
<p>BP has been the leader in deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and, therefore, 
</p>
<p>had the largest exposure. BP had grown into one of the world&rsquo;s largest oil compa-
</p>
<p>nies through a series of audacious corporate take-overs under John Browne (Lord 
</p>
<p>Browne of Maddingley who was CEO 1995&ndash;2007.
</p>
<p>Browne transformed BP from a dying corporation in the early 1990s into the world&rsquo;s sec-
ond largest oil behemoth. He refocused BP on &lsquo;elephants&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash; the big oil reservoirs&nbsp;&ndash; and 
ruthlessly cut costs. He used BP&rsquo;s rising share price to stage audacious takeovers of failing 
oil companies, especially in America. His success earned worldwide plaudits&hellip;. Cutting 
costs became BP&rsquo;s obsession. The philosophy was &lsquo;More for less&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash; 100 per cent of a task 
would be completed at a cost of only 90 per cent of the previous resources. &hellip; Browne&rsquo;s 
casualties included BP&rsquo;s engineers. Hundreds were fired and replaced by subcontractors. 
Just as ExxonMobil was hiring engineers because &lsquo;drilling is the core of our business&rsquo;, 
Browne was ditching BP&rsquo;s in house expertise, which could second-guess every technical 
operation on land and under the sea...3
</p>
<p>The Macondo situation was complicated, however, because although BP owned 
</p>
<p>a majority stake in the well (65%), and was the &ldquo;responsible operator&rdquo; for the US 
</p>
<p>authorities, the remaining ownership was divided between Anadarko (25%) and 
</p>
<p>Mitsui (10%). Another company: Transocean, the world&rsquo;s largest oil drilling con-
</p>
<p>tractor, owned and operated the rig; a third: Halliburton, cemented around the well 
</p>
<p>equipment; and a fourth: Cameron, made the blow-out preventer on the rig, which 
</p>
<p>was meant to be the fail-safe device to shut off the well in an emergency, if all else 
</p>
<p>failed&nbsp;&ndash; but which did not do so. In all, 12 different companies had employees on the 
</p>
<p>rig immediately prior to the explosion. Only a few of the 126 crew members on the 
</p>
<p>Deepwater Horizon worked directly for BP.
</p>
<p>2 (Council on Foreign Relations Backgrounder: U.S.&nbsp;Deepwater Drilling&rsquo;s Future&nbsp;&ndash; Toni Johnson, 25th 
May 2010). Indeed, only 3&nbsp;weeks before the explosion, President Obama had significantly relaxed 
regulations relating to offshore drilling, highlighting the need for greater US energy security.

</p>
<p> Initial Reaction
</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, Tony Hayward initially sought to divert 
</p>
<p>responsibility, observing: &ldquo;This was not our accident &hellip; This was not our drilling rig 
</p>
<p>&hellip; This was Transocean&rsquo;s rig. Their systems. Their people. Their equipment&rdquo;4 
</p>
<p>before modifying his position to say: &ldquo;A number of companies are involved, includ-
</p>
<p>ing BP, and it is simply too early&nbsp;&ndash; and not up to us&nbsp;&ndash; to say who is at fault.&rdquo;5 In 
</p>
<p>September 2010, BP released its own report into what had happened, conducted by 
</p>
<p>a team led by the BP head of operations and safety Mark Bly (see Appendix 2). 
</p>
<p>While BP&rsquo;s investigation attempted to allocate accountability among the involved 
</p>
<p>companies, Transocean and Halliburton dismissed the Bly report as incorrect, 
</p>
<p>incomplete, and an attempt to divert attention away from BP&rsquo;s alleged flawed well 
</p>
<p>design. President Obama was later to say: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough responsibility to go 
</p>
<p>around, and all parties should be willing to accept it. That includes, by the way, the 
</p>
<p>federal government.&rdquo;6 The Minerals Management Service (MMS), the federal 
</p>
<p>agency that regulated offshore drilling, had claimed that the chances of a blowout 
</p>
<p>were less than 1%, and that even if one did happen, it wouldn&rsquo;t release much oil. In 
</p>
<p>2009 the MMS had been excoriated by the U.S.&nbsp;General Accounting Office for its 
</p>
<p>lax oversight of offshore leases.7 A Presidential Commission appointed by President 
</p>
<p>Obama to investigate the disaster which reported in Jan 2011, produced an account 
</p>
<p>of events that led up to the blast which was similar to BP&rsquo;s. This is unsurprising 
</p>
<p>since computer logs and survivor testimonies meant most of what happened was 
</p>
<p>undisputed. But the Presidential Commission&rsquo;s assessment of who was to blame 
</p>
<p>was strikingly different to BP&rsquo;s: of nine material decisions, the Commission said BP 
</p>
<p>was to blame for seven or even eight; and all nine were about saving time and there-
</p>
<p>fore saving BP money. As the co-chair of the Presidential Commission William 
</p>
<p>Reilly noted: &ldquo;most of the bad decisions were made by BP or with BP&rsquo;s approval 
</p>
<p>and acceptance.&rdquo; (See Appendix 3).
</p>
<p>Days after the rig sank, Tony Hayward, flew to the US to take personal charge of 
</p>
<p>the incident, declaring that he would not leave until the problem was contained. 
</p>
<p>However, BP initially appeared slow to release information, was at first sparing with 
</p>
<p>media appearances; and some thought was projecting an arrogance for which many 
</p>
<p>had long condemned the oil industry. BP appeared slow to appreciate mounting 
</p>
<p>media and therefore, political interest and concern&nbsp;&ndash; perhaps because spillages from 
</p>
<p>off-shore oil platforms around the world are not uncommon. BP was not alone in

</p>
<p>initially failing to appreciate the significance of the accident. The US authorities 
</p>
<p>similarly played down the incident and did not appreciate the scale of the leak.
</p>
<p>A near contemporaneous spill off Australia, for example, had generated little 
</p>
<p>coverage. At this stage in the crisis, was it better to say little and let actions speak 
</p>
<p>for themselves (BP&rsquo;s previous default communications strategy when under attack) 
</p>
<p>or try to satisfy the insatiable appetite for 24-h news media attention? Hayward 
</p>
<p>himself and his principal PR and media advisers had little direct experience of the 
</p>
<p>US media and few contacts in Washington. It was reported that former aides to John 
</p>
<p>Browne were amazed that 3&nbsp;years after becoming CEO, Hayward had still not met 
</p>
<p>the US president. BP&rsquo;s media advisers were more used to dealing with financial 
</p>
<p>media&nbsp;&ndash; not the relentless pressure of 24/7 TV news and tabloid media.8
</p>
<p> &ldquo;The Well from Hell&rdquo;
</p>
<p>It was later to emerge that the Macondo well was known amongst insiders as &ldquo;the 
</p>
<p>well from hell!&rdquo; In April, the operation was $58million over budget, 43&nbsp;days behind 
</p>
<p>schedule and costing BP $500,000 each day.

<p>By May 20th 2010&nbsp;&ndash; 1&nbsp;month after the accident&nbsp;&ndash; the oil spillage was still con-
</p>
<p>tinuing. Attempts to cap the well-head had failed. US lawmakers and scientists were 
</p>
<p>accusing BP of trying to conceal what many already believed was the worst US oil 
</p>
<p>spill, eclipsing the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska, and representing a poten-
</p>
<p>tial environmental and economic catastrophe for the US Gulf coast.9 BP was forced 
</p>
<p>by the US Congress to make available a live film-feed showing the oil spewing from 
</p>
<p>the wellhead. Congress immediately put this live film-feed on the Internet and TV 
</p>
<p>stations such as CNN started showing this feed every time they referred to the disas-
</p>
<p>ter. Within hours of the live film-feed being put on the internet, independent experts 
</p>
<p>viewing the film, calculated the daily spillage to be far higher, than BP and the US 
</p>
<p>authorities had been suggesting&nbsp;&ndash; with some, uncorroborated estimates suggesting 
</p>
<p>figures 5 or 10 times higher than BP&rsquo;s figure&nbsp;&ndash; with some saying it could be of the 
</p>
<p>order of 70,000 barrels per day rather than the circa 5000 barrels suggested by 
</p>
<p>BP.&nbsp;The larger estimate gained more credence when a BP spokesman announced 
</p>
<p>that measures they had successfully taken to siphon some of the leaking oil was 
</p>
<p>containing up to 5000 barrels per day&nbsp;&ndash; but despite this partial success, the volume 
</p>
<p>of the oil continuing to spew into the Gulf of Mexico seemed hardly to have been 
</p>
<p>reduced.10 CNN and other media by this time were excoriating BP and the Obama 
</p>
<p>Administration for the continuing pollution which was threatening the livelihoods 
</p>
<p>of Louisiana fishermen and tourism-dependent businesses around the Gulf of 
</p>
<p>Mexico; as well as major biodiversity loss. A subsequent study of media coverage 
</p>
<p>of the oil spill disaster by the Pew Research Center&rsquo;s Project for Excellence in 
</p>

9 By June, President Obama was describing it as &ldquo;the worst environmental disaster in US history.&rdquo;
10 By June 14, official figures had been revised upwards to 60,000 figures daily&nbsp;&ndash; the equivalent of 
an Exxon Valdez spill every four days.

</p>
<p>Journalism found that in the mainstream news media in the 100-day period after the 
</p>
<p>explosion, the spill accounted for 22% of the US newshole&nbsp;&ndash; almost double the next 
</p>
<p>biggest story.11 This was particularly remarkable given competing stories such as 
</p>
<p>the US mid-term elections, Obama-care, the global financial crisis, Afghanistan 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;surge&rdquo; and immigration.
</p>
<p> BP&rsquo;S &ldquo;Near-Death&rdquo; Experience
</p>
<p>By May 28th, the incident was being described as the largest oil spill in US history, 
</p>
<p>dwarfing the Exxon Valdez disaster. Attempts to cap the wellhead continued to be 
</p>
<p>thwarted as BP attempted solutions never tried before, a mile under water. Tony 
</p>
<p>Hayward admitted that BP lacked the tools to stop the leak from the well in the 
</p>
<p>aftermath of the explosion and that the company would have to look for new ways 
</p>
<p>to manage &ldquo;low-probability, high impact&rdquo; risks such as the Deepwater Horizon 
</p>
<p>accident.12 This was the first failure of a BOP in 50,000 wells drilled in the oceans 
</p>
<p>around the US coast.13 The clean-up effort was comprehensive and technically 
</p>
<p>extraordinary.14 Several commentators drew analogies with the ill-fated Apollo 13 
</p>
<p>moon exploration which had to be dramatically rescued. Certainly, BP and the 
</p>
<p>industry innovated and developed new technologies in a fraction of the time that 
</p>
<p>these might have taken absent the crisis.
</p>
<p>Tony Hayward told the BBC: &ldquo;It is clear that this will be a transforming event in 
</p>
<p>the history of deep-water oil exploration.&rdquo; The clean-up had already then cost BP 
</p>
<p>$1billion plus a commitment to a $500&nbsp;m environmental fund to investigate future 
</p>
<p>solutions. Estimates of BP&rsquo;s ultimate liabilities were then variously quoted to be 
</p>
<p>$8billion or even $12billion.
</p>
<p>Less than 3&nbsp;weeks later, some US legislators were calling for BP&rsquo;s North American 
</p>
<p>operations to be put into receivership. President Obama, repeatedly referring to the 
</p>
<p>company by its old name &ldquo;British Petroleum,&rdquo; pledged to make BP pay for the clean-
</p>
<p>up. The BP chairman and CEO were summonsed to the White House where on June 
</p>
<p>16th, they announced a new fund with an initial commitment of $20 billion to com-
</p>
<p>pensate businesses and residents affected by the spill, for loss of livelihoods. It was 
</p>
<p>also announced that BP would not pay any further dividends for the rest of 2010. By 
</p>
<p>this stage, the market capitalisation of BP had been almost halved: see share price 
</p>
<p>chart&nbsp;&ndash; Appendix 4. One trillion BP shares were traded in a single week (w/c June 7); 
</p>
<p>and the ratings agencies had downgraded BP.&nbsp;In the words of industry insiders, the 
</p>
<p>company suffered a &lsquo;near death experience&rsquo; as its credit default swap (CDS), the cost 
</p>
<p>a BP creditor would have to pay for insuring that credit, became prohibitive, effec-
</p>
<p>tively assessing the likelihood of BP going bankrupt as 50%. As the BBC&rsquo;s then

</p>
<p>Economics Editor Robert Peston wrote in his blog: &ldquo;sometimes these CDS prices are 
</p>
<p>utterly misleading, because the market in them is thin. But there is a substantial mar-
</p>
<p>ket in BP credit default swaps. And the reason I&rsquo;m boring on about all this is that a 
</p>
<p>number of senior BP people&nbsp;&ndash; including members of the board&nbsp;&ndash; have volunteered to 
</p>
<p>me that what worried them most was what was happening to the CDS price&hellip;the 
</p>
<p>Gulf of Mexico debacle has increased the cost of insuring BP&rsquo;s shorter-term debt by 
</p>
<p>a factor of 50.15 Speaking 5&nbsp;months after these events, Bob Dudley, who by then had 
</p>
<p>succeeded Tony Hayward as CEO, was to recall:
</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t believe what was happening. We came very close to going on to the rocks. The 
credit markets were indicating the company was potentially going into bankruptcy. Some 
banks stopped trading crude oil with us. Some suppliers wanted to be paid in cash.16
</p>
<p>It was noticeable how little industry support appeared forthcoming in the media 
</p>
<p>and that industry associations appeared (at least publicly) inactive. Exxon Mobil 
</p>
<p>and other companies had made technical experts available (by mid June 150 employ-
</p>
<p>ees from other oil majors were seconded to the BP Houston emergency command 
</p>
<p>centre) and joined a consortium of oil companies participating in the clean up, but 
</p>
<p>this had not received substantial publicity in contrast to Exxon Mobil&rsquo;s warnings of 
</p>
<p>the threat to offshore exploration that the crisis was creating. Indeed, at televised 
</p>
<p>hearings on Capitol Hill on June 14th, representatives of Exxon Mobil, Shell and 
</p>
<p>Chevron criticised BP&rsquo;s drilling of the well and claimed that BP had not followed 
</p>
<p>industry norms on the Deepwater Horizon rig/Macondo well. There were sugges-
</p>
<p>tions that the CEOs&rsquo; criticisms were based partly on what their employees seconded 
</p>
<p>to the BP disaster command had been reporting back about the well design.
</p>
<p>Macondo&rsquo;s meltdown may well have been exacerbated by equipment failure in the case of 
the BOP, or by human error on the part of the individuals who misread the negative pressure 
test, but as far as the Big Oil bosses were concerned, BP&rsquo;s drilling practices were primarily 
to blame for the explosion.17
</p>
<p>Hayward&rsquo;s own performance before the Congressional committee, 2&nbsp;days later, 
</p>
<p>was variously described as &ldquo;stumbling&rdquo; and &ldquo;probably over-influenced by legal 
</p>
<p>advice to say little or nothing of substance.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The media and social media were rife with criticisms of BP.&nbsp; Clips of Tony 
</p>
<p>Hayward&rsquo;s gaffes were regularly posted to Facebook, You Tube etc.18 Slogans and 
</p>
<p>adverts parodying BP&rsquo;s high visibility commitment to &ldquo;Beyond Petroleum&rdquo; first 
</p>
<p>launched in 2001 were widely circulated on the internet. (Appendix 5) Many sustain-
</p>
<p>ability campaigners were particularly critical of BP, perhaps disillusioned by what 
</p>
<p>they perceived as the failure to follow through on the Beyond Petroleum commit-

</p>
<p>ment. Company leaders were subsequently to describe being taken completely by 
</p>
<p>surprise, by the extent of social media coverage of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. 
</p>
<p>The company had to build a social media team, presence and awareness pretty much 
</p>
<p>from scratch to respond to the saturation coverage on twitter, Facebook etc.19 BP&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>own website was getting 17,500 unique visitors per week immediately before the 
</p>
<p>Deepwater Horizon explosion. During the crisis, it was getting 4.5 million visitors.
</p>
<p> Capping the Well and the Immediate Crisis
</p>
<p>In July, after frenetic media speculation that the BP chairman and/or the CEO would 
</p>
<p>be forced out, Tony Hayward announced his resignation; and the American Robert 
</p>
<p>(Bob) Dudley was appointed as his successor. The wellhead was finally capped on 
</p>
<p>July 15th&nbsp;&ndash; 87&nbsp;days after the explosion. A number of corporate and public investiga-
</p>
<p>tions were under way to identify just what had happened. BP&rsquo;s own report into the 
</p>
<p>immediate causes of the accident was published on 8 September 2010. The com-
</p>
<p>pany also announced the sale of a number of assets around the world to help pay for 
</p>
<p>the disaster. Media interest declined and the share price started to recover.
</p>
<p> The Aftermath
</p>
<p>However, in Sept 2014, a US federal judge Carl J.&nbsp;Barbier ruled that BP was grossly 
</p>
<p>negligent in the disaster, and not merely negligent, thus opening &ldquo;the possibility of 
</p>
<p>$18 billion in new civil penalties for BP, nearly quadruple the maximum Clean 
</p>
<p>Water Act penalty for simple negligence and far more than the $3.5 billion the com-
</p>
<p>pany has set aside.&rdquo;20 While Judge Barbier did find Transocean and Halliburton had 
</p>
<p>acted with negligence, he concluded that only BP, which leased the well and was in 
</p>
<p>charge of the operation, was grossly negligent. He apportioned 67% of the blame for 
</p>
<p>the spill to BP, 30% to Transocean and 3% to Halliburton. The New&nbsp;York Times 
</p>
<p>reported: &ldquo;The ruling stands as a milestone in environmental law given that this was 
</p>
<p>the biggest offshore oil spill in American history, legal experts said, and serves as a 
</p>
<p>warning for the oil companies that continue to drill in the deep waters of the Gulf of 
</p>
<p>Mexico, where high pressures and temperatures in the wells test the most modern 
</p>
<p>drilling technologies.&rdquo;21
</p>
<p>Ten months later, in July 2015, it was announced that BP had agreed to pay up to 
</p>
<p>$18.7 billion in penalties to the U.S. government and five states to resolve nearly all 
</p>
<p>claims. Under the agreement with the U.S.&nbsp;Department of Justice and the states, BP 
</p>
<p>will pay at least $12.8 billion for Clean Water Act fines and natural resource

<p>damages, plus $4.9 billion to states. The payouts will be staggered over as many as 
</p>
<p>18&nbsp;years. The settlement avoided a substantial amount of further litigation. It was 
</p>
<p>the largest corporate settlement in U.S. history.
</p>
<p>The agreement added to the $43.8 billion that BP had previously set aside for crimi-
</p>
<p>nal and civil penalties and cleanup costs. Reuters reported BP as saying, &ldquo;its total pre-
</p>
<p>tax charge for the spill now stands at $53.8 billion.&rdquo; (link.reuters.com/duz94w). In 
</p>
<p>October 2015, the figure was reassessed upwards from $18.7 billion to $20.8 billion.22
</p>
<p> Conclusion
</p>
<p>Ultimately, Deepwater Horizon has been a disaster, not just for BP, but for many 
</p>
<p>other businesses; for the 11 men who lost their lives in the explosion and their fami-
</p>
<p>lies and friends; but also inter alia for US tax-payers, British pensioners, many of 
</p>
<p>the residents of the five US states most affected, and marine life. Like other corpo-
</p>
<p>rate cause celebres like Bhopal, the legacy of April 20th 2010 may rumble on for 
</p>
<p>years to come. The company itself has distilled its learning in five key areas includ-
</p>
<p>ing spill-control and crisis-management; and is sharing this learning with govern-
</p>
<p>ments, regulators and the industry around the world. Reviewing BP asset sales since 
</p>
<p>Deepwater Horizon, The Economist described BP as a &ldquo;shrunken giant&rdquo; and con-
</p>
<p>cluded: &ldquo;Repairing the balance-sheet and books is one thing. Repairing BP&rsquo;s reputa-
</p>
<p>tion for management excellence will take longer. The poor safety record of past 
</p>
<p>years reflected over-zealous cost-cutting. The more recent legal woes in America, 
</p>
<p>and previous troubles in Russia, suggested that BP has been ill-run.&rdquo;23

</p>
<p>Speaking to an audience of graduate students, Hayward began by describing the 
</p>
<p>huge change that BP went through from 1999 onwards. &lsquo;Until the later 1990s BP 
</p>
<p>was a relatively small oil and gas company. In an extraordinary period between 
</p>
<p>1999 and 2003, under the leadership of John Browne, we put together a whole series 
</p>
<p>of mergers and acquisitions&nbsp;&ndash; such that by 2003 we had created one of the largest 
</p>
<p>integrated oil and gas, energy companies in the world&nbsp;&ndash; equal second with Shell&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>with operations everywhere.
</p>
<p>Then catastrophe struck. In the space of several years we had a whole series of 
</p>
<p>real disasters actually.

</p>
<p>&bull; We blew up a refinery in Texas City and killed 15 people.
</p>
<p>&bull; Our flagship project, called Thunderhorse, almost ended upon the sea bed in 
</p>
<p>6000&nbsp;ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico
</p>
<p>&bull; We had a major, major oil spill in Alaska
</p>
<p>&bull; We were found guilty by the Department of Justice for a trading manipulation in 
</p>
<p>the natural gas market of the US
</p>
<p>&bull; And our financial performance in that period was appalling. We under-performed 
</p>
<p>our major competitors by 30&ndash;50%
</p>
<p>And so it was with that that I was given the job of being the CEO of BP.
</p>
<p>The only thing you can do is to confront it head on&nbsp;&ndash; we assembled a new team, 
</p>
<p>mainly internal but with some external people. We went through a critical self- 
</p>
<p>assessment with the following diagnosis:
</p>
<p> 1. BP was a company which was top down, too directive and not good at listening&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>good stories travelled fast, bad ones travelled nowhere.
</p>
<p> 2. We had failed to recognise that we were an operating company&nbsp;&ndash; too many gen-
</p>
<p>eralists, not enough skilled specialists.
</p>
<p> 3. We had created an extraordinary amount of complexity when we put all those 
</p>
<p>companies together&nbsp;&ndash; consultants mapped 10,000 organisational interfaces- for a 
</p>
<p>company of 100,000 employees that&rsquo;s impressive!&nbsp;&ndash; too much analysis and not 
</p>
<p>enough decision-making.
</p>
<p> 4. Then we sat down as a team to decide what to do about it.
</p>
<p>Firstly, we created something called &lsquo;The Way Forward&rsquo;
</p>
<p> &ndash; Safer, reliable operations
</p>
<p> &ndash; Having the right people in the right place
</p>
<p> &ndash; Performance: restoring revenues and reducing complexity
</p>
<p>Secondly, we reinstated competitor benchmarking&nbsp;&ndash; looking at the performance 
</p>
<p>of our principal competitor, Shell&nbsp;&ndash; an $8billion gap in Q2 2007.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, we addressed issues of leadership and culture change.
</p>
<p>At that time it turned out we had 36 live and operating leadership models at vari-
</p>
<p>ous parts of BP&nbsp;&ndash; not surprising; we had assembled all these companies from all 
</p>
<p>over the place and they all had their different bits of heritage.
</p>
<p>So my team spent 3 or 4&nbsp;months, without consultants, without any external help, 
</p>
<p>talking about the company that we wanted, the culture that we wanted and the lead-
</p>
<p>ership framework which would begin to enable that sort of culture.
</p>
<p>The new leadership framework would need to:
</p>
<p> 1. Recognise skills and professional capability and competence
</p>
<p> 2. Recognise how important it is to energise and motivate people
</p>
<p> 3. Focus on decision-making&nbsp; &ndash; there had been too much introspection and not 
</p>
<p>enough taking of decisions and getting on with it
</p>
<p>2 Beyond BP: The Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon Disaster 2010</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30
</p>
<p> 4. Deliver results.
</p>
<p> 5. The culture of an organisation is shaped by what the leaders do&hellip;.
</p>
<p>We are early in that journey. It&rsquo;s probably a 3&ndash;5&nbsp;year journey for those who work 
</p>
<p>in the offices and probably a 5 plus year journey for the people who work out in the 
</p>
<p>facilities&hellip;..
</p>
<p>Is it working (2&nbsp;years into the process)? Well, I would say we are making prog-
</p>
<p>ress, we are not there yet. We&rsquo;ve closed the performance gap, so $8billion in Q2 
</p>
<p>2007 has become no gap at all in Q2 2009. We beat the market in three out of the 
</p>
<p>last four quarters, and there is a lot of momentum in the company in terms of rising 
</p>
<p>revenues and falling costs. So, there&rsquo;s a lot of momentum but it&rsquo;s clear that to create 
</p>
<p>the sort of company that we want to create, which will be sustainable, we have more 
</p>
<p>work still to do.
</p>
<p> Appendix 2: Bly Report Summary
</p>
<p>On 8th September 2008, BP released its internal Accident Investigation Report on 
</p>
<p>Deepwater Horizon, compiled by Mark Bly, BP&rsquo;s Head of Operations and Safety. 
</p>
<p>The report concluded that &lsquo;the team did not identify any single action or inaction 
</p>
<p>that caused this accident. Rather, a complex and interlinked series of mechanical 
</p>
<p>failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and 
</p>
<p>team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident. 
</p>
<p>Multiple companies, work teams and circumstances were involved over time.&rsquo; The 
</p>
<p>main failures were a combination of engineering design and human judgment.
</p>
<p>The main engineering design failure identified in the Bly Report concerns cement 
</p>
<p>for which Halliburton is accountable. Two quotes from the report highlight this:
</p>
<p>&lsquo;The investigation team concluded that there were weaknesses in cement design 
</p>
<p>and testing, quality assurance and risk assessment.&rsquo; &lsquo;The investigation team has 
</p>
<p>identified potential failure modes that could explain how the shoe track cement and 
</p>
<p>the float collar allowed hydrocarbon ingress into the production casing.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>The cause of the critical failure of the blowout preventer (BOP), which should 
</p>
<p>have provided a last resort failsafe, is still being investigated.
</p>
<p>A series of human judgment failures take most of the blame, for which the Bly 
</p>
<p>Report suggests that BP and Transocean are accountable, see quotes below:
</p>
<p>The Transocean rig crew and BP well site leaders reached the incorrect view that the test 
was successful and that well integrity had been established.
</p>
<p>The rig crew did not recognize the influx and did not act to control the well until hydro-
carbons had passed through the BOP and into the riser.
</p>
<p>Through a review of rig audit findings and maintenance records, the investigation team 
found indications of potential weaknesses in the testing regime and maintenance manage-
ment system for the BOP (blowout prevention).
</p>
<p>It has been suggested that at each point where a test result or reading showed 
</p>
<p>there might be a problem, the decision to ignore it was made because of reliance on

</p>
<p>The main recommendations of the report, which highlight the main failings 
</p>
<p>found by the inquiry are:
</p>
<p> 1. Improved technical practices, requirements and operational guidance regarding 
</p>
<p>cementing, pressure testing and subsea blowout prevention (including strength-
</p>
<p>ening BP&rsquo;s minimum requirements for drilling contractor&rsquo;s BOP maintenance 
</p>
<p>management systems).
</p>
<p> 2. Increased capability and competency at all levels, including advanced training, 
</p>
<p>competency assessment, embedding lessons learnt and shared learning through-
</p>
<p>out oil industry.
</p>
<p> 3. Strengthen BP&rsquo;s rig audit process to improve the closure and verification of audit 
</p>
<p>findings and actions across BP-owned and BP-contracted drilling rigs.
</p>
<p> 4. Require drilling contractors to implement an auditable integrity monitoring sys-
</p>
<p>tem to continually assess and improve the integrity performance of well control 
</p>
<p>equipment against a set of established leading and lagging indicators.

<p>3Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Sustainable Product Index
</p>
<p>Robert J.&nbsp;Crawford and&nbsp;N. Craig&nbsp;Smith
</p>
<p>On 16 July 2009, Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke announced an ambitious plan to 
</p>
<p>develop a &ldquo;Sustainable Product Index&rdquo; that would enable customers to access reli-
</p>
<p>able, standardised information on where its products came from, what resources 
</p>
<p>they required for manufacture and delivery, and how they should be disposed of 
</p>
<p>and/or re-cycled. He went on to explain &ndash;
</p>
<p>[T]he human footprint, our use of natural resources for everything we grow, eat, drink, 
</p>
<p>make, package, buy, transport and throw away&hellip;all of that is outpacing the earth&rsquo;s capacity 
</p>
<p>to sustain us&hellip;[Today,] we see only bits of information, but not the full picture across the 
</p>
<p>supply chain. We don&rsquo;t know the patterns, hidden costs and impacts...Nor do we have a 
</p>
<p>single source&hellip;for evaluating the sustainability of our products.1
</p>
<p>1 Ibid.
</p>
<p>As I look back at our progress over the past few years, I think 
</p>
<p>the most difficult challenge has been to measure the 
</p>
<p>sustainability of our products. It&rsquo;s in this area that I believe we 
</p>
<p>can truly accelerate and broaden our efforts&hellip;with a more 
</p>
<p>elegant, research-driven approach.
</p>
<p>Mike Duke, President and CEO, Wal-Mart (Remarks prepared 
for Mike Duke at Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Sustainability Milestone Meeting,

</p>
<p>For example, as the world&rsquo;s largest jewellery retailer, Wal-Mart planned to work 
</p>
<p>with its suppliers to develop sustainable packaging and create a tracking system 
</p>
<p>regarding the diamonds, gold, and silver used in its jewellery, thereby ensuring that 
</p>
<p>its suppliers adhered to responsible mining criteria.2
</p>
<p>Duke was speaking at a meeting of suppliers, Wal-Mart employees (or &ldquo;associ-
</p>
<p>ates&rdquo;), and outside stakeholders. The initiative, he explained, would come in three 
</p>
<p>phases. First, the company would ask 100,000 suppliers to answer 15 questions regard-
</p>
<p>ing the sustainability of their operations. Second, Wal-Mart would contribute to the 
</p>
<p>creation of a consortium of academics to collaborate with suppliers, non- governmental 
</p>
<p>organisations (NGOs) and governments to &ldquo;develop a global database of information 
</p>
<p>on products&rsquo; lifecycles&rdquo;. Third, this information would be translated into &ldquo;a simple 
</p>
<p>rating system for consumers&rdquo; as they made their purchasing decisions.3
</p>
<p>In some quarters Duke&rsquo;s announcement was seen as a signal that Wal-Mart was 
</p>
<p>fulfilling its 2005 promise to become a global leader in sustainability. With annual 
</p>
<p>revenues of over $430 billion, it had surpassed Exxon to become the world&rsquo;s largest 
</p>
<p>company, wielded enormous power over its suppliers and served as a bellwether for the 
</p>
<p>direction global capitalism was taking. Building on a growing record of environmental 
</p>
<p>achievements and consultation with outside stakeholders, the Sustainability Index rep-
</p>
<p>resented an entirely new departure, empowering consumers as well as embracing a 
</p>
<p>policy of enhanced transparency. It was an additional sign, supporters believed, that 
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart was placing sustainability at the heart of company strategy, initiating a win-
</p>
<p>win-win cycle that would also increase profits and efficiency. To remain competitive, 
</p>
<p>they argued, other companies would have to adopt similar policies.4
</p>
<p>However, many of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s critics&nbsp;&ndash; from labour unions, social and environ-
</p>
<p>mental activists, to a variety of media outlets&nbsp;&ndash; took a more skeptical view. They 
</p>
<p>argued that Wal-Mart&rsquo;s methodology was riddled with conflicts of interest and was 
</p>
<p>merely a public relations ploy, in large part to deflect attention from its low wages 
</p>
<p>and harsh labour practices, labor rights issues in its supply chains, and destructive 
</p>
<p>impact on the communities it entered when opening new stores.
</p>
<p> Background
</p>
<p>Sam Walton, Wal-Mart&rsquo;s founder, grew up during the Great Depression in the Ozarks, 
</p>
<p>the southern Midwest of the United States. It was a poverty-stricken region that was 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;pre-industrial, pre-urban, pre-immigrant&rdquo;, and strongly Evangelical Christian. The 
</p>
<p>economy was overwhelmingly agricultural, with independent families growing live-
</p>
<p>stock, grain and fruit on small plots, in contrast to the large-scale mechanized farms 
</p>
<p>that grew commodity crops further to the east.5 In 1945, Walton purchased a failing

</p>
<p>Ben Franklin 5&amp;10 Store as a franchisee. After 4&nbsp;years of creative experimentation 
</p>
<p>and careful study of other retailers, he turned it into the most successful branch in 
</p>
<p>Arkansas.6 Gradually expanding his Ben Franklin franchises to 16 branches, Walton 
</p>
<p>began to envision a new kind of retail strategy. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the simple lesson we learned,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>he wrote. &ldquo;[S]ay I bought an item for 80 cents. I found that by pricing it at $1.00 I 
</p>
<p>could sell three times more of it than by pricing it at $1.20&hellip;the overall profit was 
</p>
<p>much greater.&rdquo;7 When the Ben Franklin supplier- owners refused to allow him to 
</p>
<p>develop this super-discount strategy, Walton decided to start his own chain. On 2 July 
</p>
<p>1962, he opened Wal-Mart Discount City in Rogers, Arkansas, offering the same 
</p>
<p>items as nearby stores at prices that were consistently 20% lower. By 1985, with over 
</p>
<p>1,000 stores, Walton was recognized as the richest man in America.8
</p>
<p>Initial Achievements To implement his strategy of &ldquo;everyday low prices&rdquo;, Walton 
</p>
<p>and his successors pursued a two-pronged approach: a relentless search to cut costs 
</p>
<p>and the creation of a logistics and distribution system of unprecedented efficiency. 
</p>
<p>Walton&rsquo;s timing was lucky. In the prosperous 1960s, the United States was develop-
</p>
<p>ing a culture of mass consumption. Retailing was becoming standardised by huge 
</p>
<p>organisations that set a new standard for economies of scale, consumers were enticed 
</p>
<p>to purchase &ldquo;status&rdquo; brands by television advertising, and automobiles offered con-
</p>
<p>sumers the option of shopping outside traditional downtown commercial centres.
</p>
<p>Walton chose rural America as his market, a region his competitors were neglect-
</p>
<p>ing.9 However, it was his bare-bones management style that enabled the company to 
</p>
<p>grow into the world&rsquo;s largest corporation by 2002. &ldquo;Now, when it comes to Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart,&rdquo; Walton wrote, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no two ways about it: I&rsquo;m cheap&hellip;.We exist to pro-
</p>
<p>vide value to our customers.&rdquo;10
</p>
<p>Beyond pioneering direct purchase from manufacturers, Wal-Mart cut costs 
</p>
<p>through a number of stringently controlled labour practices. First, to keep wages 
</p>
<p>low and safeguard management flexibility in its employment practices, Wal-Mart 
</p>
<p>opposed organized labour to the point that it would close stores that unionized. 
</p>
<p>Second, the company deliberately understaffed its stores: since there were never 
</p>
<p>enough associates to accomplish their assigned tasks, they had to work very hard, 
</p>
<p>enhancing productivity but also&nbsp;&ndash; as many would later charge in class-action law-
</p>
<p>suits&nbsp;&ndash; forcing them to skip rest breaks and meals, as well as working overtime 
</p>
<p>without compensation.11 Third, Wal-Mart tended to provide fewer benefits, such as 
</p>
<p>health insurance, than its competitors. This was due to the cost of health insurance, 
</p>
<p>which workers with low salaries could not support, an unusually high rate of

</p>
<p>employee turnover (estimated at over 50% per year) combined with a year-long 
</p>
<p>waiting period for the right to obtain benefits, and (it was alleged) a systematic 
</p>
<p>policy to encourage employees to enter public assistance programmes, from 
</p>
<p>Medicaid to food stamps.12 Fourth, store managers and executives faced constant 
</p>
<p>pressure to keep costs low, from sharing rooms while on the road to bonuses based 
</p>
<p>on cost containment results and productivity enhancement.13
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart grew with a small town &ldquo;saturation&rdquo; strategy, spreading out slowly, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;like molasses&rdquo;, to nearby communities as distribution centres were established fur-
</p>
<p>ther and further from its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters. By the late 1960s, 
</p>
<p>Walton had recognized the need to develop an efficient logistics system, not only to 
</p>
<p>warehouse and deliver goods when needed on a massive scale, but as an entirely 
</p>
<p>new system of management control. With a team of information-technology spe-
</p>
<p>cialists, Walton eventually established a monopsony-like power over its suppliers, 
</p>
<p>which enabled Wal-Mart to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Anticipate consumer demand with unparalleled precision, removing a key advan-
</p>
<p>tage that producer/manufacturers had enjoyed over retailers;
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish a just-in-time delivery system that was far more cost-efficient than its 
</p>
<p>local rivals could achieve;
</p>
<p>&bull; Develop integrated solutions along the entire supply chain, in effect shifting much 
</p>
<p>of the risk (of over-production, late delivery, etc.) to its suppliers and middlemen.
</p>
<p>While keeping costs low, Wal-Mart was also able to demand a greater variety of 
</p>
<p>goods with pinpoint accuracy in terms of consumer demand, from suppliers. The 
</p>
<p>retailer even began to scrutinize the books of its suppliers in order to impose cost 
</p>
<p>and efficiency &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; in their business practices as well as dictating pric-
</p>
<p>ing and even marketing strategies to them. For their part, suppliers recognized that 
</p>
<p>they had little choice but to conform to Wal-Mart&rsquo;s dictates; for example, by 2003 
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart accounted for 17% of Procter and Gamble&rsquo;s global sales.14
</p>
<p>The Wal-Mart Way True to its roots in the rural Ozarks, Wal-Mart developed a 
</p>
<p>folksy culture that admirers believed was genuine. As Walton wrote: &ldquo;We thrive on a 
</p>
<p>lot of the traditions of small-town America, especially parades with marching bands, 
</p>
<p>cheerleaders, drill teams, and floats.&rdquo;15 The result was a brand of &ldquo;pro- corporate pop-
</p>
<p>ulism&rdquo; of low prices and an oasis where the courtesy and friendliness of Wal-Mart 
</p>
<p>employees were supposed to offer a contrast with the outside world. While not an 
</p>
<p>Evangelical Christian company, many Wal-Mart executives claimed to operate in 
</p>
<p>accordance with &ldquo;the values of Scripture&rdquo;.16 Via intensive training and peer pressure,

</p>
<p>Wal-Mart associates learned that they should appear happy and open, to view them-
</p>
<p>selves as &ldquo;servant leaders&rdquo;, with reference to Christ&rsquo;s work, and to expect &ldquo;equality 
</p>
<p>and solidarity&rdquo; from their colleagues.17 During its first few decades, Wal-Mart oper-
</p>
<p>ated almost exclusively in the conservative rural setting later to be known as the &ldquo;red 
</p>
<p>states&rdquo;, where media scrutiny and labour laws were weak, trade unions and govern-
</p>
<p>ment regulation were viewed with suspicion, and consumers were grateful for &ldquo;low 
</p>
<p>prices&rdquo;, while employees were described as &ldquo;appreciating good jobs&rdquo;. In this atmo-
</p>
<p>sphere, outside critics were ignored as a matter of company policy.18
</p>
<p>For their part, Wal-Mart managers and executives faced a number of exacting 
</p>
<p>requirements, some of which were rigorously quantified, others a question of 
</p>
<p>touchy-feely leadership. First, the core of their job was to achieve&nbsp;&ndash; perhaps even 
</p>
<p>surpass&nbsp;&ndash; their revenue and profit goals, as well as make efficiency gains, all with an 
</p>
<p>eye to the company&rsquo;s quarterly results. With their year-end bonuses closely tied to 
</p>
<p>meeting these goals, managers were under pressure to perform. Second, they were 
</p>
<p>supposed to act as the guardians of the company culture, which they should instill 
</p>
<p>in their associates. This included an order to &ldquo;Push responsibility&nbsp;&ndash; and authority&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>down&rdquo; to regional managers and associates, who were empowered to think on their 
</p>
<p>own. Third, they were mandated to pay attention to economic and social trends that 
</p>
<p>would affect the company, which they were expected to transmit to the top as well 
</p>
<p>as address on their own initiative.19 Routinely working 60&ndash;80&nbsp;h weeks, including 
</p>
<p>obligatory Saturday morning meetings at headquarters for regional managers, they 
</p>
<p>often suffered &ldquo;early burn out&rdquo;.20
</p>
<p>The Critics As Wal-Mart grew, its reach and power attracted determined opposi-
</p>
<p>tion. Critics began to mount protest campaigns against the company. Individual and 
</p>
<p>class action lawsuits from a huge variety of organisations made Wal-Mart the &ldquo;most 
</p>
<p>sued&rdquo; company in the world, severely undermining its reputation.21 They argued 
</p>
<p>that the company, which competitors felt compelled to imitate if they were to sur-
</p>
<p>vive, was a principal mover in the &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo; in the new global economy. 
</p>
<p>They raised a wide range of issues, including the need to:

</p>
<p>&bull; Ameliorate labour practices that they believed were brutal, often illegal, and 
</p>
<p>failed to provide a living wage. In their view, the company should allow associ-
</p>
<p>ates to unionize, raise wages, offer better health insurance benefits, and treat 
</p>
<p>them more humanely.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide both a more equitable and ethical management of its supply chain, from 
</p>
<p>the treatment of &ldquo;sweatshop&rdquo; workers in supplier countries such as China and 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh, to treatment of the company&rsquo;s truckers.23
</p>
<p>&bull; Loosen its grip on supplier/manufacturers, many of whom bore the brunt of price 
</p>
<p>cuts and risk. For example, Wal-Mart&rsquo;s pricing policies were alleged to have 
</p>
<p>caused the bankruptcy of the Vlasic pickle company. As it depended on Wal-Mart 
</p>
<p>for 30% of its gross sales, the company had felt compelled to accept the sales 
</p>
<p>price that Wal-Mart imposed, even though it was too low to re-coup expenses and 
</p>
<p>ruined the brand&rsquo;s reputation for quality.24
</p>
<p>Increasingly, critics targeted Wal-Mart&rsquo;s basic business model, which in their 
</p>
<p>view was the root cause of these issues. To transform itself into a more responsible 
</p>
<p>corporate citizen, some argued, Wal-Mart would have to attenuate its cost-cutting 
</p>
<p>policies and invest far more in the communities it entered and in environmental 
</p>
<p>initiatives. This meant that the company might have to charge its customers more, 
</p>
<p>and that its brand image for &ldquo;every day low prices&rdquo; would no longer be tenable as 
</p>
<p>originally implemented. Any other ethical measures, many opponents argued, 
</p>
<p>merely represented a public relations diversion from the real issues.25
</p>
<p> The Greening of&nbsp;Wal-Mart
</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s, Wal-Mart stores had more or less saturated rural markets in the 
</p>
<p>US To continue growing, the company would have to enter new markets both in 
</p>
<p>urban areas and abroad. However, these markets differed fundamentally from the 
</p>
<p>Ozarks: they were more cosmopolitan, had pockets of highly-educated consumers 
</p>
<p>who felt politically empowered, and had long operated under stricter regulatory 
</p>
<p>regimes; they tended to have large unions, living-wage controls, and zoning laws to 
</p>
<p>protect parks and other public spaces. When Wal-Mart executives entered these 
</p>
<p>areas, they were shocked to learn that the company was viewed less as a &ldquo;consumer 
</p>
<p>advocate&rdquo; promising jobs and lower prices, but rather as a damaging presence to be 
</p>
<p>resisted.26 Moreover, with notable exceptions in Mexico and Canada, Wal-Mart 
</p>
<p>stores proved far less successful in international markets, where they came up 
</p>
<p>against unionized workers with strong political ideologies as well as regulatory

</p>
<p>restrictions that undermined the basic tenets of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s traditional strategies, for 
</p>
<p>example in constructing big box stores in low-tax areas at the edge of towns.27
</p>
<p>From 2004, Wal-Mart faced a growing storm of protest in such vehicles as the 
</p>
<p>film &ldquo;Wal-Mart: The High Price of Low Cost&rdquo;, directed by Robert Greenwald, but 
</p>
<p>also in grassroots campaigns to legally bar the company from opening stores in 
</p>
<p>major urban areas. For example, a broad coalition of activists defeated a Wal-Mart- 
</p>
<p>sponsored referendum in Inglewood, California (in the Los Angeles area) that had 
</p>
<p>sought to turn public into commercial land. Wal-Mart lost a number of similar polit-
</p>
<p>ical battles in other major US cities.28 To take the fight to a national level, union- 
</p>
<p>sponsored organisations such as &lsquo;Wal-Mart Watch&rsquo;, devoted themselves to opposing 
</p>
<p>the company in what some saw as an ideological crusade.
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart soon found itself the target of higher expectations of corporate social 
</p>
<p>responsibility, the &ldquo;bad example&rdquo; that warranted attack from the left. Critics of the 
</p>
<p>company, Wal-Mart&rsquo;s top leadership came to recognize, were beginning to have a 
</p>
<p>serious impact on its long-term prospects. This prompted several Wal-Mart board 
</p>
<p>members to bring the issue up with CEO Lee Scott.29
</p>
<p>A New Way Behind-the-scenes developments had long been percolating at Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart. After a trip to Africa in 2002, the founder&rsquo;s eldest son, Robert Walton, began 
</p>
<p>to seek ways that the family foundation might preserve wilderness areas. This led to 
</p>
<p>a friendship with biologist Peter Seligman, co-founder and CEO of Conservation 
</p>
<p>International (CI), an environmental organization in Washington, DC.&nbsp;CI&rsquo;s advisory 
</p>
<p>clients included Starbucks and McDonald&rsquo;s. Over the next 2&nbsp;years, Seligman took 
</p>
<p>Robert Walton and his sons on a series of exotic trips, including hikes in Madagascar 
</p>
<p>and scuba diving in the Galapagos. While Seligman was seeking donations for CI, 
</p>
<p>he was also building the case for Wal-Mart to fundamentally transform its business 
</p>
<p>practices in a way that could make the company &ldquo;a driver of tremendous change&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>This would involve the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of the company in the areas over which it had 
</p>
<p>control: in the US it was the largest private consumer of electricity and had the sec-
</p>
<p>ond largest truck fleet; its suppliers would strive to meet its demands, whatever they 
</p>
<p>were; and it could influence the buying choices of its regular customers, who num-
</p>
<p>bered some 180 million.30
</p>
<p>With disappointing financial results&nbsp;&ndash; between 2000 and 2005 its stock price fell 
</p>
<p>nearly 20%&nbsp;&ndash; and a series of recent PR debacles in mind, then-CEO Lee Scott was 
</p>
<p>willing to listen to new ideas. Seligman and several CI colleagues came to 
</p>
<p>Bentonville in June, 2004. A greener policy, they argued, would offer a way for Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart to enhance its efficiency, improve its image, and engage its employees in an 
</p>
<p>exciting mission&nbsp;&ndash; a &ldquo;win-win-win&rdquo; scenario. Soon thereafter, Scott hired CI and a

</p>
<p>consulting firm, Blu Skye, which would develop sustainability metrics. Over the 
</p>
<p>next year, they measured wasteful practices and put forward a number of &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>suggestions for improvement, with the goal of creating a sustainability system 
</p>
<p>rather than a series of discrete actions. Wal-Mart stipulated that their compensation, 
</p>
<p>and that of other NGOs paid by the company, remain confidential.31
</p>
<p>Scott also hired the PR firm Edelman in early summer, 2005, which specialized 
</p>
<p>in corporate &ldquo;reputation management&rdquo;. Edelman created a rapid-response &ldquo;war 
</p>
<p>room&rdquo; at Wal-Mart&rsquo;s headquarters, which was designed to generate rapid responses 
</p>
<p>and &ldquo;spin&rdquo; to promote a positive take on stories about the company. The group 
</p>
<p>began to target &ldquo;swing voters&rdquo;, the 60% or so of shoppers who had not yet consid-
</p>
<p>ered boycotting Wal-Mart for environmental and/or labour reasons.32 In addition, 
</p>
<p>Edelman recommended that Wal-Mart adopt a &ldquo;co-option policy&rdquo;, in effect bringing 
</p>
<p>critics into the company&nbsp;&ndash; they were variously viewed as an early warning system, 
</p>
<p>monitors of public opinion, and generators of innovative ideas at little or no cost. 
</p>
<p>The engagement of these stakeholders, which would expand the collaboration begun 
</p>
<p>with CI, was viewed as a way to legitimize the retailer, particularly if they secured 
</p>
<p>endorsements of their practices.33
</p>
<p>The Katrina Epiphany The war room&rsquo;s first major test was the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Louisiana coast on 29 August, 
</p>
<p>2005. Mobilizing its distribution network, Wal-Mart filled significant gaps in the 
</p>
<p>efforts by various government relief agencies. Its accomplishments&nbsp; &ndash; providing 
</p>
<p>food, water, medicine, and temporary shelter&nbsp; &ndash; were almost universally praised, 
</p>
<p>achieving a far more positive response from the public than did the governmental 
</p>
<p>authorities involved. Even the &lsquo;Wake Up Wal-Mart&rsquo; campaign wrote in a letter to the 
</p>
<p>company that the Katrina measures &ldquo;brought out the best in Wal-Mart and we 
</p>
<p>applaud your hurricane relief efforts.&rdquo;34 Beyond screening the media for critical 
</p>
<p>stories about the company, the war room played a crucial role coordinating Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart&rsquo;s communications efforts with the actors in the field.35
</p>
<p>According to Scott, the Katrina experience represented &ldquo;a key personal moment&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>regarding his commitment to environmental sustainability. It was then, he said, that 
</p>
<p>he overcame the &ldquo;skepticism of the company&rsquo;s environmental critics&hellip;We stepped 
</p>
<p>back&hellip;and asked one simple question: How can Wal-Mart be that company&nbsp;&ndash; the 
</p>
<p>one we were during Katrina&nbsp;&ndash; all the time?&rdquo; Rather than roll out a toothless pro-
</p>
<p>gramme that was more public relations than substance, he promised to create a truly 
</p>
<p>meaningful sustainability policy. Katrina relief, he said, &ldquo;was only the beginning&rdquo;

</p>
<p>of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s charm offensive.36 By October, 2005, Scott and his team had articu-
</p>
<p>lated a set of three &ldquo;aspirational&rdquo; goals for Wal-Mart, including:
</p>
<p>&bull; To create zero waste, which promised to save money via a recycling 
</p>
<p>programme;
</p>
<p>&bull; To be 100% supplied by renewable energy;
</p>
<p>&bull; To sell products that sustain resources and the environment.37
</p>
<p>Scott also promised to reduce greenhouse gases produced by Wal-Mart stores by 
</p>
<p>20% over the next 7&nbsp;years, his first acknowledgment of the importance of climate 
</p>
<p>change. In addition to engaging with other environmental groups, Scott indicated 
</p>
<p>that Wal-Mart would work with anti-sweatshop groups to improve monitoring of 
</p>
<p>overseas factories to guard against worker and human rights abuses. Measures to 
</p>
<p>improve the treatment of its associates, he said, were also underway: health care 
</p>
<p>coverage would be provided to Wal-Mart associates for $25 per month. He even 
</p>
<p>called on the US Congress to raise the minimum wage.38 However, just days after 
</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s announcements, the New York Times reported on a leaked draft memo to 
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart&rsquo;s board. In it, Executive Vice President for Benefits, Susan Chambers, 
</p>
<p>described how many Wal-Mart employees were uninsured or on public assistance 
</p>
<p>for health (and 46 percent of the children of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s 1.33 million US employees 
</p>
<p>were uninsured or on Medicaid), and advocated a strategy to &ldquo;dissuade unhealthy 
</p>
<p>people from coming to work at Wal-Mart&rdquo;.39
</p>
<p>Steps to Implementation Wal-Mart immediately undertook steps to realize Scott&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>vision. An early hire was Adam Werback, a former Sierra Club President turned 
</p>
<p>consultant. In his first meeting with Wal-Mart executives, Werback was deeply 
</p>
<p>impressed with the interest they showed for his organizational expertise. According 
</p>
<p>to Werback:
</p>
<p>The executives peppered me with questions about how to make sustainability attractive to 
</p>
<p>the broadest set of the American public, how to engage associates, how to measure success, 
</p>
<p>whom I respected, and whom they should be talking to. They spoke candidly about their 
</p>
<p>challenges and called on my expertise in facing them&hellip;the company opened its [as yet 
</p>
<p>unannounced] goals to me.40
</p>
<p>As part of the &ldquo;sustainability network&rdquo; that Wal-Mart was building, Werback and 
</p>
<p>others refined, and sometimes helped to initiate, a number of organizational practices.

<p>44
</p>
<p>First, Werback praised Scott&rsquo;s aspirational (or &ldquo;North Star&rdquo;) goals of October, 2005. 
</p>
<p>Designed to set the company in an entirely new direction, they should also be realistic, 
</p>
<p>employees should see a concrete way to work towards them, and they were connected 
</p>
<p>to the core business, i.e. the distribution network and product selection. Moreover, if 
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart failed to meet them, the company would have to accept the blame.41
</p>
<p>Second, Werback designed a &ldquo;Personal Sustainability Project&rdquo; to involve and 
</p>
<p>educate Wal-Mart associates through voluntary activities. It was part of a policy to 
</p>
<p>engage Wal-Mart employee creativity in new ways, to make them &ldquo;part of the solu-
</p>
<p>tion&rdquo; in areas that concerned them. Starting with a personal sustainability project&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>bicycling to work, skipping fast food meals, replacing incandescent bulbs with 
</p>
<p>fluorescent ones&nbsp;&ndash; they would attract the interest of their colleagues, many of whom 
</p>
<p>would learn about sustainability and perhaps develop their own projects. Voluntarism 
</p>
<p>combined with concrete projects, Werback stressed, worked far better than preach-
</p>
<p>ing ideals. Eventually, they elected &ldquo;sustainability captains&rdquo; to transmit their goals 
</p>
<p>and explain their activities to others. Their numbers grew to half a million, or just 
</p>
<p>under one third of all Wal-Mart employees.42
</p>
<p>Third, Werback and others advised Wal-Mart to become &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; as a way 
</p>
<p>to advance the company&rsquo;s sustainability goals. In Werback&rsquo;s view, Wal-Mart needed 
</p>
<p>to recognize its environmental &ldquo;blind spots&rdquo;, which would encourage awareness 
</p>
<p>within the company; this should enhance compliance with norms and laws. Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart would also release a series of reports on its progress toward the &ldquo;North Star&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>goals. This could lead, according to Werback, to complete transparency, which 
</p>
<p>included honest and comprehensive reporting, immediate and candid admission of 
</p>
<p>mistakes by Wal-Mart leaders, and the opening of the company to all constructive 
</p>
<p>outside stakeholders. This would result, Werback argued, in an influx of new ideas 
</p>
<p>for improvement as well as uncover business opportunities that Wal-Mart had not 
</p>
<p>yet considered.43
</p>
<p>The Continuing Controversy Many in the activist community praised the steps 
</p>
<p>that Wal-Mart was beginning to take, which they viewed as the opportunity of a 
</p>
<p>lifetime. However, others questioned the motives and sincerity of the company, 
</p>
<p>maintaining the suspicion that it would only lead to &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo;, that is, the 
</p>
<p>appearance of environmentally-friendly measures that ultimately had only a mar-
</p>
<p>ginal impact. Journalists also remained skeptical. Jeffrey Goldberg of the New&nbsp;Yorker, 
</p>
<p>for example, observed in a visit to the war room that Wal-Mart managers appeared 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;tightly scripted&rdquo; and mistrustful rather than open and available; he was repeatedly 
</p>
<p>instructed &ldquo;not to write down anything [he] saw&rdquo;.44 Perhaps more important, critics 
</p>
<p>feared that the co-option policy would create &ldquo;corporate front groups&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; by taking 
</p>
<p>money from private corporations, NGOs were less likely to pressure their sponsors 
</p>
<p>on issues of concern. Moreover, when NGOs endorsed the measures that these com-
</p>
<p>panies were undertaking, it created the appearance of a conflict of interest, that is, a 
</p>

<p>45
</p>
<p>stamp of approval upon payment. It was insidiously corrupting, the critics argued. 
</p>
<p>Other NGOs that interacted with Wal-Mart, such as the Environmental Defense 
</p>
<p>Fund, refused contributions from the company as a matter of policy.45
</p>
<p>Finally, critics raised the problem of what was enough. How could the standard 
</p>
<p>be balanced against the criticisms of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s social impact? Moreover, what did 
</p>
<p>sustainability mean? Definitions varied significantly. For example, in the view of 
</p>
<p>Stuart Hart, &ldquo;going green&rdquo; was essentially reactive&nbsp;&ndash; an incremental effort to do the 
</p>
<p>minimum in order to avoid sanctions&nbsp;&ndash; and merely served to perpetuate the existing 
</p>
<p>industrial paradigm. To be truly sustainable, Hart argued, companies had to become 
</p>
<p>proactive, thinking about how they fit into the ecosystem. Eventually, he believed, 
</p>
<p>as stewards of sustainability at the cutting edge, companies would find or invent 
</p>
<p>entirely new industrial paradigms that would promote clean technologies, reduce 
</p>
<p>their impact on nonrenewable resources to zero, and address the needs of the poor 
</p>
<p>as well as the rich countries.46 Wal-Mart, in his view, was beginning to place sustain-
</p>
<p>ability at the core of its business strategy, for example with its promotion of a cloth-
</p>
<p>ing line made from organic cotton.47 John Elkington, the visionary author of the 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;triple bottom line&rsquo; concept, argued that corporations must transform themselves 
</p>
<p>from &ldquo;locusts&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; exploiting resources with little regard to their impact&nbsp;&ndash; into &ldquo;honey 
</p>
<p>bees&rdquo; that worked as architects of environmentalism.48 At a minimum, according to 
</p>
<p>Adam Werbach, sustainability must become part of the culture of a company rather 
</p>
<p>than a public relations effort run by a legal or corporate affairs department.49
</p>
<p> Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Sustainability Initiatives
</p>
<p>In 2006, Blu Skye, with the help of Conservation International, engaged in discus-
</p>
<p>sions with Wal-Mart executives in an effort to set actionable priorities. By combin-
</p>
<p>ing Wal-Mart&rsquo;s sales data with environmental impact factors from the Union of 
</p>
<p>Concerned Scientists, they chose 14 areas on which to focus, including product 
</p>
<p>groups as well as functional areas (See Exhibit 3.1). In each of the 14 areas, Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart assigned an executive vice president as sponsor, along with a &ldquo;network cap-
</p>
<p>tain&rdquo;, who was usually a senior vice president charged to build a &ldquo;Value Network&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>The captains contacted academics, NGOs, suppliers, and other stakeholders to join 
</p>
<p>discussions on sustainability measures that Wal-Mart might undertake.50 The meet-
</p>
<p>ings ended with &ldquo;go-do&rsquo;s&rdquo;, i.e., requests that were directed principally at Wal-Mart&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>suppliers, who bore the principal responsibility to take action.

</p>
<p>The Value Networks at Work While wide-ranging discussions addressed how to 
</p>
<p>transform Wal-Mart&rsquo;s supply chain, cut costs, and provide benefits to the consumer, 
</p>
<p>the activities of the Value Networks depended in large measure on the energy that 
</p>
<p>their captains devoted to them. The Wal-Mart employees involved still had to 
</p>
<p>accomplish their full-time jobs: with few exceptions, there were no new full-time 
</p>
<p>staff hired to run the Networks. Some of them, such as the packaging Network, had 
</p>
<p>500 members or more; others, such as that of jewellery, consisted of only 15 or so. 
</p>
<p>According to one Network member,51 Wal-Mart strove to include relevant stake-
</p>
<p>holders, regardless of their opinions of the company. In many cases, even deter-
</p>
<p>mined critics participated.52
</p>
<p>By July 2006, Wal-Mart could point to some specific accomplishments. Examples 
</p>
<p>included:
</p>
<p>&bull; Savings of $75 million from a 25% increase in fuel efficiency that also reduced 
</p>
<p>carbon emissions by 400,000&nbsp;tons. This in effect met one of CEO Scott&rsquo;s original 
</p>
<p>promises.
</p>
<p>&bull; The adoption of a web-based sustainability scorecard to facilitate the evaluation 
</p>

</p>
<p>While acknowledging the potential of these initiatives, Wal-Mart critics were 
</p>
<p>quick to point out that the principal burden appeared to fall on the suppliers&nbsp;&ndash; they 
</p>
<p>were the ones that would bear the cost of the &ldquo;race to the top&rdquo; (of new sustainability 
</p>
<p>standards) that Wal-Mart was attempting to initiate. Moreover, many activists con-
</p>
<p>tinued to refuse to engage with Wal-Mart, which they criticized for failing to meet 
</p>
<p>their basic demands regarding community and other social issues.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Wal-Mart was developing a number of new processes that were 
</p>
<p>under-reported in the popular press. Beyond the certification and scorecard require-
</p>
<p>ments, members of the Value Networks were beginning to provide a wide range of 
</p>
<p>sustainability expertise to its suppliers. To some observers this represented a funda-
</p>
<p>mental transformation of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s engagement with suppliers: rather than merely 
</p>
<p>impose conditions on end-suppliers regardless of what others downstream had 
</p>
<p>done, Wal-Mart was systematically addressing issues in its entire supply chain. For 
</p>
<p>example, Value Network members were beginning to educate organic cotton farm-
</p>
<p>ers on sustainable techniques. In addition, Wal-Mart was developing deeper, longer- 
</p>
<p>term relations with its suppliers, not only by cutting out the middleman as a way to 
</p>
<p>enhance traceability, but also by more carefully selecting suppliers that operated in 
</p>
<p>accordance with its sustainability standards. This entailed the re-training of Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart buyers, in effect adding sustainability concerns into their job descriptions and 
</p>
<p>offering them the opportunity to specialize in it. However, critics argued, it might 
</p>
<p>require decades to evaluate the effectiveness of these processes.54
</p>
<p>The Reports Starting in 2007, Wal-Mart began to issue reports on its sustainability 
</p>
<p>accomplishments. For many this represented a step on the way to transparency, 
</p>
<p>further opening the company to outside scrutiny and input. Indeed, if Wal-Mart 
</p>
<p>failed to meet its goals&nbsp;&ndash; to reduce plastic shopping bag use by 30% in 5&nbsp;years, for 
</p>
<p>example, or to double its truck fleet efficiency by 2015&nbsp;&ndash; the results would be very 
</p>
<p>public. However, the reports&rsquo; deficiencies came in for criticism as well. &ldquo;Despite 
</p>
<p>numerous programme descriptions, goals and statistics,&rdquo; one critic wrote, &ldquo;careful 
</p>
<p>reading reveals a surprising lack of context, undefined metrics, and goals that turn 
</p>
<p>out to be meaningless.&rdquo; Moreover, she claimed, the reports failed to directly address 
</p>
<p>both the challenges ahead and the concerns of certain stakeholders. Finally, though 
</p>
<p>the report referenced the sustainability guidelines established by the Global 
</p>
<p>Reporting Initiative, Wal-Mart apparently did not use them in any consistent way. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;These missteps,&rdquo; the writer concluded, &ldquo;raise the question of whether Wal-Mart&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>systematic lack of clarity is intentional.&rdquo;55
</p>
<p>Furthermore, some critics argued that the omissions from Wal-Mart&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Sustainability Reports were far more significant than what it claimed to have accom-
</p>
<p>plished. They implied that Wal-Mart had got its sustainability criteria wrong, that its 
</p>
<p>statistics were unreliable or misleading, and that Wal-Mart&rsquo;s growth model by its

<p>very nature was unsustainable. For example, one report stated that by calculating 
</p>
<p>energy use required for additional consumers &ndash;
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart&rsquo;s new stores will use more energy than its energy-saving measures will save. 
</p>
<p>Even if Wal-Mart meets its goal to cut 2.5 million metric tons of CO2 emissions at existing 
stores by 2013, new stores built in 2007 alone will consume enough energy to add approxi-
</p>
<p>mately one million tons of CO2 to the atmosphere [which would add] 28 metric tons of new 
emissions within the same period.56
</p>
<p>The report then catalogued Wal-Mart&rsquo;s environmental transgressions, from 
</p>
<p>destruction of wetlands and degradation of water supplies from construction-site 
</p>
<p>hazardous waste, to increased transportation needs. (See Exhibit 3.2 for an example 
</p>
<p>of criticisms.)

<p>Exhibit 3.2 Is Wal-Mart Really A &ldquo;Green&rdquo; Company? (Press Release 
</p>
<p>from Wal-Mart Watch)
</p>
<p>Over the past 40&nbsp;years, Wal-Mart has contributed significantly to the degrada-
</p>
<p>tion of the environment. Then, 2&nbsp;years ago, McKinsey and Company advised 
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart to do the following:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a proactive stance: shape the external debate by becoming a role model on a 
</p>
<p>significant societal issue.&rdquo; [August 2004 McKinsey Memo]
</p>
<p>Since then, Wal-Mart has taken some commendable steps to clean up its 
</p>
<p>impact on the environment, promising to reduce food product packaging, sell 
</p>
<p>more energy efficient light bulbs, and improve fuel efficiency in its trucking 
</p>
<p>fleet. However, as the following facts show, Wal-Mart&rsquo;s massive size and its 
</p>
<p>voracious need for growth mean that the company&rsquo;s current green efforts are 
</p>
<p>to the health of the planet what cleaning one store is to its global maintenance 
</p>
<p>operations.

</p>
<p>Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Growth Will Offset Its Planned Energy Savings Wal-Mart&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>new stores will use more energy that its energy-saving measures will save. 
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart hopes to cut 2.5&nbsp;million metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2013, by 
</p>
<p>making its existing stores 20% more efficient. New stores built in 2007 alone, 
</p>
<p>however, will consume enough electricity to add approximately one million 
</p>
<p>metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere. At that rate, (adding one million metric 
</p>
<p>tons of CO2 per year because of new stores), by 2013 Wal-Mart will be

<p>Wal-Mart Has Over 2,300 Supercenters in the United States The average 
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart Supercenter is mammoth, averaging 200,000 square feet and occu-
</p>
<p>pying 20&ndash;30 acres of land &ndash; about as large as a football stadium. There are 
</p>
<p>over 2,200 Supercenters in the United States, in addition to thousands of stan-
</p>
<p>dard WalMarts, Neighborhood Markets, Sam&rsquo;s Clubs, distribution centers and

<p>warehouses. It is the largest commercial entity in the United States, both

<p>Wal-Mart Parking Lots Contribute To Water Pollution A Wal-Mart 
</p>
<p>Supercenter may cover several acres, but its parking lot can be three times the

<p>size of the store itself, placing its footprint at well over 18 acres. A 2005 report 
</p>
<p>by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance estimated at the time that Wal-Mart 
</p>
<p>stores and parking lots covered roughly 75,000 acres (or 117 square miles) in 
</p>
<p>the U.S., equal to the land size of Tampa, Florida, a figure that has continued 
</p>
<p>to rise as Wal-Mart continued to expand over the last 2&nbsp;years. Parking lots

<p>contribute directly to what is referred to as &ldquo;non-point source water pollu-

<p>Wal-Mart Supercenters Use An Enormous Amount Of Energy When

<p>Compared To Other Retailers Even with a 15% reduction over the current

<p>average energy use, a Wal-Mart Supercenter, open 24&nbsp;h a , uses 96.5 MBTU 
</p>
<p>or 96,500 British thermal units of energy per or nearly three times the average 
</p>
<p>use by a residential home in the United States each year. This is almost double

<p>the rate of energy of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s nearest competitor&rsquo;s &ldquo;superstore,&rdquo; which

</p>
<p>pany estimates that its U.S. operations were responsible for 15.3&nbsp;million met-

<p>Wal-Mart Truck Fleet Adds Major Traffic to the Roads and Pollution to 
</p>
<p>the Air For example, a Wal-Mart Distribution Center in Merced, CA Is 
</p>
<p>Projected To Have 900 Daily Truck Trips. Using average emissions rates cal-
</p>
<p>culated by the EPA, the 900 truck trip estimate works out to around 2.4 extra 
</p>
<p>tons of particulate matter and 83 extra tons of nitrogen oxides entering the 
</p>
<p>atmosphere each year because of Wal-Mart trucks. Since Merced is an area 
</p>
<p>with significant air pollution problems already, residents living closest to this 
</p>
<p>distribution center would be at an increased risk. Wal-Mart currently has 135 
</p>
<p>distribution centers in 38 states, which translates to approximately 120,000

<p>daily truck trips or equal to the approximate number of vehicles that use the

<p>to ship all unsold and returned products to &ldquo;Return Centers&rdquo; and sort out the 
</p>
<p>products for disposal there. Wal-Mart has used company vehicles to do this 
</p>
<p>task. [Las Vegas Review-Journal, 12/21/05]
</p>
<p>What exactly did Wal-Mart do wrong? Wal-Mart is under investigation for 
</p>
<p>ignoring laws designed to protect the public from the dangers of hazardous 
</p>
<p>materials to human health and the environment, including:
</p>
<p>&bull; California Hazardous Waste Laws. California state law requires busi-
</p>
<p>nesses to handle and dispose of hazardous waste in a specific way, includ-
</p>
<p>ing paying fees for disposal and using designated hazardous materials 
</p>
<p>trucks for transport. Wal-Mart may have avoided paying disposal fees, and 
</p>
<p>is being investigated for using its own trucks to transport hazardous waste.
</p>
<p>&bull; Nevada State Law. Wal-Mart may have violated Nevada law by bringing 
</p>
<p>hazardous waste into the state and disposing of it in a facility permitted to 
</p>
<p>only accept waste that originated inside Nevada.
</p>
<p>&bull; Federal Law. Federal law prohibits transporting potential hazardous waste 
</p>
<p>across state lines without a permit. Wal-Mart may have violated these stat-
</p>
<p>ues by bringing hazardous waste into Nevada from California.
</p>
<p>&bull; Federal Clean Water Act. Wal-Mart is also accused of violating the Federal 
</p>
<p>Clean Water Act, a law designed to preserve the integrity of lakes, rivers 
</p>
<p>and wild lands. The fact that Wal-Mart has been accused of violating this 
</p>
<p>Act points to questions of more serious environmental infringements.
</p>
<p>In spite of these criticisms, many stakeholders defended Wal-Mart&rsquo;s record as a 
</p>
<p>worthy exercise of its power. For example, in order to overcome consumer reluctance 
</p>
<p>to purchase concentrated laundry detergents, which would hugely cut transportation 
</p>
<p>costs without impacting their cost-effectiveness, Wal-Mart forced all of its suppliers 
</p>
<p>to convert to them; once the concentrated variety was all that appeared on the shelves, 
</p>
<p>consumers came to prefer them. According to A.G.&nbsp; Lafley, CEO of Proctor &amp; 
</p>
<p>Gamble, &ldquo;Lee [Scott] pushed me&hellip;we totally, totally changed the way we manufac-
</p>
<p>ture liquid laundry detergents.&rdquo; Wal-Mart also eliminated up to 50% of packaging on 
</p>
<p>such items as prescription drugs, again lowering resource requirements as well as 
</p>
<p>costs, savings that were passed on to consumers.57 (See Exhibit 3.3 for an example.)

<p>ment. Our Food, Agriculture and Seafood Sustainable Value Network is 
</p>
<p>working with farmers, ranchers and fisheries to provide our customers with 
</p>
<p>access to fresh food at affordable prices. One way we are able to do this is by 
</p>
<p>purchasing more produce from local farmers and purchasing products that are 
</p>
<p>grown and produced by people who use sustainable practices in their 
</p>
<p>businesses.
</p>
<p>Food, Agriculture and Seafood Sustainable Value Network Goals
</p>
<p>&bull; Create a long-term supply of reliable agricultural and seafood products 
</p>
<p>harvested in a sustainable way.
</p>
<p>&bull; Walmart plans to purchase all of its wild-caught fresh and frozen fish for 
</p>
<p>the U.S. market from Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)-certified fisher-
</p>
<p>ies by 2011.
</p>
<p>&bull; Work with Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA) and Aquaculture 
</p>
<p>Certification Council, Inc. (ACC) to certify that all foreign shrimp suppli-
</p>
<p>ers adhere to Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) standards in the U.S. by 
</p>
<p>2011.
</p>
<p>Walmart is Working to Sustain the Future of Food, Agriculture and 
</p>
<p>Seafood We have taken on a number of projects and goals under our Food, 
</p>
<p>Agriculture and Seafood Network that will provide our customers with the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to purchase fresh and sustainably-produced food.
</p>
<p>&bull; In 2008, we launched even greater efforts to purchase locally grown pro-
</p>
<p>duce in the U.S. With our locally grown initiative, we can provide high-
</p>
<p>quality, low-priced fruits and vegetables while supporting farmers and 
</p>
<p>their local economies. By reducing the number of miles food travels 
</p>
<p>between the farm and our shelves, we can decrease greenhouse gas emis-
</p>
<p>sions and conserve fuel, while providing our customers with the freshest 
</p>
<p>produce.
</p>
<p>&bull; We are working with suppliers to offer more socially-responsible products 
</p>
<p>on our shelves. As a part of Walmart&rsquo;s first Earth Month in-store campaign 
</p>
<p>in April 2008, we launched the sale of six coffees carried under our exclu-
</p>
<p>sive Sam&rsquo;s Choice brand that are either certified organic, Fair Trade 
</p>
<p>Certified or Rainforest Alliance Certified. These coffees enable customers 
</p>
<p>to get gourmet coffee at a great value while providing benefits to farmers, 
</p>
<p>their communities and the environment.

<p>&bull; Sam&rsquo;s Club was one of the first retailers to offer Fair Trade Certified wine. 
</p>
<p>Since November 2008, Sam&rsquo;s Club members have been able to purchase 
</p>
<p>Fair Trade Certified Malbec wine from Argentina in more than 400 Sam&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Club facilities. A portion of the sales are collected by Transfair USA and 
</p>
<p>used to build schools, medical facilities and other community projects.
</p>
<p>&bull; We are committed to featuring more sustainably-harvested seafood in our 
</p>
<p>Walmart stores and at Sam&rsquo;s Club. Our efforts have included collaboration 
</p>
<p>with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), Sustainable Fisheries 
</p>
<p>Partnership (SFP), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Environmental 
</p>
<p>Defense Fund (EDF) and the Alaskan salmon industry for wild caught sea-
</p>
<p>food and with Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA) for all farmed seafood. 
</p>
<p>Together, we are encouraging our seafood suppliers to implement plans 
</p>
<p>that strengthen fishery management practices, rebuild stocks, reduce envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental impacts and encourage support for broader marine ecosystem 
</p>
<p>management and protection efforts.
</p>
<p>&bull; As of January 31, 2009, in aggregate, 49% of the total pounds of fresh or 
</p>
<p>frozen seafood sold at Walmart and Sam&rsquo;s Club have the MSC or ACC 
</p>
<p>certification with many more fisheries currently progressing through the 
</p>
<p>certification process. We currently have 28 products in our stores carrying 
</p>
<p>the MSC certification with more selections underway. And 100% of the 
</p>
<p>farmed shrimp products we purchase meet factory processing criteria 
</p>
<p>established by the ACC, and we are in the process of having shrimp, cat-
</p>
<p>fish, tilapia and salmon farms become ACC certified as well.
</p>
<p>&bull; In 2008, Walmart de Mexico sourced 99% of the fruit and vegetables sold

</p>
<p>&bull; Together with the global relief and development organization Mercy Corps 
</p>
<p>and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), we 
</p>
<p>launched the Inclusive Market Alliance for Rural Entrepreneurs in 
</p>
<p>Guatemala which is focused on improving the lives of small-scale farmers. 
</p>
<p>During a 3&nbsp;year project, the Alliance will help small-scale farmers move 
</p>
<p>from traditional crops, such as corn and beans, to growing demand-driven 
</p>
<p>crops such as tomatoes, peppers, potatoes and onions that will be sold to 
</p>
<p>major retailers like Walmart.
</p>
<p>&bull; Our ASDA stores in the U.K. are working to put more locally grown and 
</p>
<p>locally produced items on their shelves as well. ASDA currently works 
</p>
<p>with approximately 500 local food producers in the U.K. who provide 
</p>
<p>more than 5,000 products to ASDA stores across the country.

<p>What Others Are Saying 
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;The impact of Walmart committing itself to a sustainable source of its 
</p>
<p>fish is profound in several different ways. It&rsquo;s profound in that it ensures 
</p>
<p>that populations of fish survive&mdash;that they&rsquo;re not mined but that they&rsquo;re 
</p>
<p>harvested in a way that will survive over time.&rdquo; (Peter Seligman, CEO, 
</p>
<p>Conservation International in Walmart&rsquo;s 2008 &ldquo;Sustainability 2.0&rdquo; DVD)
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Perhaps most importantly, because of the tremendous volume that Sam&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>and Walmart are moving on fair trade terms, they&rsquo;re lifting tens of thou-
</p>
<p>sands of farmers out of poverty. They&rsquo;re having a huge impact on the 
</p>
<p>ecosystems, on the environment in those countries and in those communi-
</p>
<p>ties where this product is grown. So, the impact of Walmart and Sam&rsquo;s in 
</p>
<p>fair trade is proving to be tremendous.&rdquo; (Paul Rice, President and CEO, 
</p>
<p>Transfair USA in Walmart&rsquo;s 2008 &ldquo;Sustainability 2.0&rdquo; DVD)

<p>Walmart is working diligently toward achieving its sustainability goals. 
</p>

</p>
<p>#&nbsp;#&nbsp;#
</p>
<p>While the evidence was anecdotal, many saw it as proof that Wal- Mart was begin-
</p>
<p>ning to place sustainability at the core of its business model. The company couldn&rsquo;t, 
</p>
<p>in this view, accomplish Scott&rsquo;s aspirational goals merely by incremental improve-
</p>
<p>ments, by &ldquo;greening&rdquo;. Finally, because of the savings the company was realising, it 
</p>
<p>helped Wal-Mart&rsquo;s bottom line&nbsp;&ndash; the company had proved it could do well while it 
</p>
<p>was doing good.58
</p>
<p>The Future of the Approach Many in the environmental movement applauded the 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s efforts. As Michelle Harvey, Programme Manager of Corporate 
</p>
<p>Partnerships at the Environmental Defense Fund, observed: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to hate Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart. The company is far from perfect and there&rsquo;s a long way to go, but the effort is 
</p>
<p>genuine.&rdquo; However, she acknowledged, a comprehensive methodology to evaluate 
</p>
<p>the results was not yet available. Furthermore, it was uncertain what the company 
</p>
<p>would do once the &ldquo;low-hanging fruit&rdquo; was picked and harder choices had to be 
</p>
<p>made. &ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; she said, Wal-Mart &ldquo;was doing the things that could be justified 
</p>
<p>in terms of costs. [Moreover,] much of it remains the responsibility of the suppliers, 
</p>
<p>which Wal-Mart is pressuring to meet certain standards.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In particular, Harvey noted, there were many areas where there was no clear busi-
</p>
<p>ness case. There were also issues for which the data were more ambiguous or even 
</p>
<p>speculative, but where long-term impacts could be very high. For example, while it 
</p>
<p>was easy to target carbon emissions, the anti-bacterial agent triclosan was becoming 
</p>
<p>pervasive in the environment, appearing even in human breast milk. &ldquo;[Its] effects are 
</p>
<p>not quite proven,&rdquo; Harvey explained, &ldquo;but many of us are concerned.&rdquo; What about 
</p>
<p>alternative energy sources, she asked? What about products, such as bottled water, 
</p>
<p>that sold well yet were bad for the environment? &ldquo;Solutions to those problems,&rdquo; she 
</p>
<p>concluded, &ldquo;could bring higher costs or higher prices for consumers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Ultimately, how Wal-Mart chose to wield its power could expose the company to 
</p>
<p>criticism. For example, Wal-Mart unilaterally decided to discontinue the sale of 
</p>

</p>
<p>BPA, a (legal) plastic liner in baby bottles, because of a potential cancer risk. Not 
</p>
<p>only did this cause problems for BPA suppliers, but the health implications were 
</p>
<p>uncertain at best. Moreover, critics pointed out, the company would continue to sell 
</p>
<p>cigarettes&nbsp;&ndash; the health risks of which were proven scientifically&nbsp;&ndash; because customers 
</p>
<p>wanted them.59
</p>
<p> The Sustainability Index
</p>
<p>During the economic recession that began in 2008, Wal-Mart sales rose 1.7%, while 
</p>
<p>those of most of its competitors fell, sometimes precipitously. Other news was 
</p>
<p>mixed. Contradicting its reputation for &ldquo;never settling out of court&rdquo;, Wal-Mart 
</p>
<p>agreed to pay $54.25 million to settle a class-action lawsuit with workers claiming 
</p>
<p>unpaid compensation for off-the-clock work.60 In a precedent-setting agreement for 
</p>
<p>North America, eight Wal-Mart autoshop workers in Gaineau, Canada were allowed 
</p>
<p>to sign a union-sponsored contract with the company, ending a 3-year legal dis-
</p>
<p>pute.61 However, the company also continued to generate its own PR disasters. In 
</p>
<p>the Deborah Shank case, Wal-Mart dropped its claim to $US470,000 for reimburse-
</p>
<p>ment of the employee&rsquo;s medical expenses met under Wal-Mart&rsquo;s medical insurance 
</p>
<p>plan&nbsp;&ndash; half the compensation she had won in court for a motor vehicle accident that 
</p>
<p>left her permanently disabled. Although Wal-Mart was legally entitled to claim it in 
</p>
<p>accordance with her insurance policy, the lawsuit became a viral-news sensation, 
</p>
<p>particularly after Wal-Mart beat Shank in a US Supreme Court judgment.62
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Sustainability Index represented the largest attempt by a retailer to 
</p>
<p>develop a green-labelling system for the products it offered. The entire process was 
</p>
<p>estimated to be completed in approximately 5&nbsp;years. In step 1, Wal-Mart would col-
</p>
<p>lect data from over 100,000 suppliers regarding the sustainability of their opera-
</p>
<p>tions. The questions focused on: (1) energy and climate, (2) material efficiency, (3) 
</p>
<p>natural resources, and (4) people and community. While the survey results would 
</p>
<p>serve the stakeholder consortium in the next step, it was always designed as a tool 
</p>
<p>to get suppliers to investigate and understand practices more deeply. No other major 
</p>
<p>company, it was claimed, had attempted to reach so deeply into such a varied supply 
</p>
<p>chain. Top suppliers were instructed to deliver the surveys to Wal-Mart by 1 October 
</p>
<p>2009, with the others following soon thereafter. In step 2, Wal-Mart would help to 
</p>
<p>organise a consortium of stakeholders to develop a database on the entire life cycle 
</p>
<p>of products. Wal-Mart provided seed funding for this task, with the expectation that 
</p>
<p>the suppliers as well as other retailers would contribute&nbsp;&ndash; it would be an effort to 
</p>
<p>establish global, agreed-upon standards of sustainability. In Step 3, these standards 
</p>
<p>would be encapsulated into labels that consumers could consult before making the 
</p>
<p>purchase decision. (See Exhibits 3.4 and 3.5.)

<p>Exhibit 3.4 Sustainable Product Index: Fact Sheet.
</p>
<p>On July 16, 2009, Walmart announced plans to develop a worldwide sustain-
</p>
<p>able product index, which is expected to lead to higher quality, lower costs 
</p>
<p>and measure the sustainability of products and help customers, live better in 
</p>
<p>the twenty-first century. One of the biggest challenges we all face is measur-
</p>
<p>ing the sustainability of a product. Walmart believes a research-driven 
</p>
<p>approach involving universities, retailers, suppliers and non-government 
</p>
<p>organizations (NGOs) can accelerate and broaden this effort.
</p>
<p>The Need for an Index 
</p>
<p>&bull; The world&rsquo;s population is increasing.
</p>
<p>&bull; It is estimated that the global population will reach 9&nbsp;billion by 2050.
</p>
<p>&bull; The world&rsquo;s natural resources are decreasing.
</p>
<p>&bull; Natural resources for everything we grow, eat, drink, make, package, 
</p>
<p>buy, transport and throw away is outpacing the earth&rsquo;s capacity to sus-
</p>
<p>tain it.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customers want more efficient, longer lasting, better performing products. 
</p>
<p>They want to know:
</p>
<p>&bull; the materials in the product are safe
</p>
<p>&bull; that it is made well
</p>
<p>&bull; the product was produced in a responsible way
</p>
<p>Index Step 1: Supplier Assessment Walmart will provide each of its 100,000 
</p>
<p>global suppliers with a survey of 15 simple, but powerful, questions to evaluate 
</p>
<p>their own company&rsquo;s sustainability. The questions are divided into four areas:
</p>
<p>&bull; Energy and Climate
</p>
<p>&bull; Natural resources
</p>
<p>&bull; Material efficiency
</p>
<p>&bull; People and Community
</p>
<p>Under these categories are some familiar questions on greenhouse gas 
</p>
<p>emissions and location of factories, but the list also includes some new areas, 
</p>
<p>such as water use and solid waste produced. For a complete list of the ques-
</p>
<p>tions, visit walmartstores.com
</p>
<p>Walmart will ask its top tier U.S. suppliers to complete the survey by Oct.1. 
</p>
<p>Outside the United States, the company will develop timelines on a country-
</p>
<p>by-country basis for suppliers to complete the survey.
</p>
<p>These are not complicated questions, but we have never systematically 
</p>
<p>asked for this kind of information before. This is an important first step in 
</p>
<p>assessing the sustainability of suppliers, but for true transparency, we also 
</p>
<p>need a tool for the sustainability of products.

</p>
<p>Index Step 2: Lifecycle Analysis Database As a second step, Walmart is 
</p>
<p>helping create a consortium of universities that will collaborate with suppli-
</p>
<p>ers, retailers, NGOs and government to develop a global database of informa-
</p>
<p>tion on the lifecycle of products &ndash; from raw materials to disposal. Walmart 
</p>
<p>will provide the initial funding for the consortium, but it is not our intention 
</p>
<p>to create or own this index.
</p>
<p>The company will also partner with one or more leading technology com-
</p>
<p>panies to create an open platform that will power the index.
</p>
<p>Arizona State University and the University of Arkansas will jointly 
</p>
<p>administer the consortium. Talks are underway with additional universities to 
</p>
<p>join the newly formed consortium.
</p>
<p>Index Step 3: A Simple Tool for Consumers The final step of the index is 
</p>
<p>to provide customers with product information in a simple, convenient, easy 
</p>
<p>to understand rating, so they can make choices and consume in a more sus-
</p>
<p>tainable way. How that information is delivered to consumers is still undeter-
</p>
<p>mined, but could take the form of a numeric score, color code or some other 
</p>
<p>type of label. The sustainability consortium will help determine the scoring 
</p>
<p>process in the coming months and years.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The index will bring about a more transparent supply chain, drive prod-
</p>
<p>uct innovation and, ultimately, provide consumers the information they 
</p>
<p>need to assess the sustainability of products. If we work together, we can 
</p>
<p>create a new retail standard for the 21st century.&rdquo;

<p>Critics quickly stepped forward. According to blogger Philip Mattera, the pro-

</p>
<p>the very best, its measures would merely tinker with a system that required far more

</p>
<p>avoidance policies and its disastrous effect on small competitors.&rdquo;63 Others criti-
</p>
<p>cized the consortium approach, which they viewed as riddled with potential con-
</p>
<p>flicts of interest. Not only did it appear to call on manufacturers to create the 
</p>
<p>methodologies by which they would be rated, but&nbsp;&ndash; for an admission price between 
</p>
<p>$US50,000 and $250,000 per year&nbsp;&ndash; they might stand to gain an insider&rsquo;s advantage 
</p>
<p>over non-participating manufacturers, regardless of whether or not the results were 
</p>
<p>made public.64 At this early stage, however, these criticisms remained speculative.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were the methodological difficulties inherent to any attempt 
</p>
<p>to evaluate&nbsp;&ndash; in a rigorously quantitative framework&nbsp;&ndash; the entire life cycle of a given 
</p>
<p>product or product group. They included:
</p>
<p>&bull; The quantification of all the relevant interactions of the product with its sur-
</p>
<p>roundings. Not only would this entail an enormous amount of data to cover the 
</p>
<p>exchanges and transportation involved in the global economy, but it necessitated 
</p>
<p>assumptions to fill statistical gaps, lessening its accuracy.65
</p>
<p>&bull; Agreement or consensus would have to be achieved on methodological standards 
</p>
<p>for time horizons (i.e. what &ldquo;cradle&rdquo; and what &ldquo;grave&rdquo; would be measured), 
</p>
<p>impact assessments, etc. Without such agreement, data might well be incompat-
</p>
<p>ible, hence impossible to aggregate.66
</p>
<p>&bull; The gaps in life cycle assessments must be addressed, including: (1) developing 
</p>
<p>more effective coverage of hazardous materials; (2) taking account of the com-
</p>
<p>plexities involved in recycling issues, e.g. tracking materials, such as paper, 
</p>
<p>whose quality degrades with each recycle; (3) creating more dynamic measure-
</p>
<p>ment tools, i.e. cumulative problems over the long term, in particular the interac-
</p>
<p>tion of materials in waste dumps.67
</p>
<p>Other observers offered a more positive assessment of the index&rsquo;s prospects. 
</p>
<p>First, Wal-Mart&rsquo;s green labeling would offer consumers the opportunity to choose, 
</p>
<p>initiating a process of education for up to two-thirds of its customers. At present, 
</p>
<p>only 10% of shoppers actively cared about the sustainability of their purchases, up 
</p>
<p>to 25% would never care, but 65% were undecided. Second, while rarely imposing 
</p>
<p>its standards on particular products, Wal-Mart was signalling to suppliers that their 
</p>
<p>practices on sustainability must become more transparent. If they refused to do so, 
</p>
<p>it would impact their business prospects with Wal-Mart in the competition for shelf 
</p>
<p>space. Third, the suppliers themselves would learn about their own processes, intro-
</p>
<p>ducing many of them to sustainability concerns that they would need to address 
</p>
<p>systematically. If viewed correctly, this would enable them to understand their own

<p>4Tetra Pak: Sustainable Initiatives in China
Fu Jia, Zhaohui Wu, and Jonathan Gosling
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>In January 2009, Hudson Lee, President of Tetra Pak China, was looking over a 
cliff. The company had invested &euro;65&nbsp; million to expand its packaging plant on 
Hohhot, the capital city of Inner Mongolia, China, on top of its initial 2004 invest-
ment of &euro;50&nbsp;m. The expansion plan was based on the inexorable rise in milk con-
sumption in China&nbsp;&ndash; growing from 16 to 23&nbsp;million tons between 2005 and 2012. 
This was a market with huge opportunities for growth, and powerful domestic 
brands to reach out to China&rsquo;s 1.4&nbsp;billion consumers. The plant initially designed to 
produce 20&nbsp; billion cartons a year now had the capacity to process 60&nbsp; billion 
cartons.
</p>
<p>Then the bottom fell out of the market. Powdered milk, contaminated with 
melamine, poisoned hundreds of children, 8 died and many others were critically ill. 
Confidence in the domestic brands Yili and Mengnui crashed. These were Tetra Pak 
China&rsquo;s main customers, the bedrock of the investment plan. And Tetra Pak aseptic 
packaging clearly hadn&rsquo;t prevented this contamination as it took place way before 
the packaging process. As millions of consumers switched to imported brands, it 
looked as if Tetra Pak&rsquo;s business was evaporating along with the industry it sup-
plied. There could be no overnight solution: Hudson Lee and his executive team </p>

<p>were forced to look beyond their own part in a supply chain, to see what they could 
do to repair a broken food- production system.
</p>
<p>Hudson sat in his office in Beijing, looking at a table of display of Tetra Pak milk 
cartons printed in various languages. Behind these cartons are some photos of early 
TP managers&rsquo; visits to China back in the 1970s. TP had a long history in China and 
was there ever since the country stepped out of a disastrous cultural revolution and 
began to open up to western countries. TP&rsquo;s success had always been building on its 
positive engagement with the economy and stakeholders in the host country. Hudson 
began to reconsider the overall business models of TP in China and posed a ques-
tion: how could TP China handle the milk safety issue and what role should the 
company play in the milk scandals of its customers?
</p>
<p> Background
</p>
<p>Since its entry into China in 1972, Tetra Pak has been an influential player in the 
emerging Chinese dairy industry. Its business operations have expanded success-
fully together with the consumption of dairy products in China in the last two 
decades. The company leverages its packaging technology to shape the entire sup-
ply chains of various dairy producers and the dairy industry development in China. 
The company claims that social and environmental sustainability are integral to its 
business strategy. The objective of this case is to illustrate this integration of Tetra 
Pak&rsquo;s sustainability strategy, its implementation in supply chain management, and 
challenges the company faces in a maturing industry as local competitors become 
ever more sophisticated in business operations, and in the face of health risks such 
as that faced in 2008.
</p>
<p> Chinese Dairy Industry Overview
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak is located in two supply chains: packaging and dairy. The dairy producers 
are the company&rsquo;s biggest customers, with products including milk, yogurt, con-
densed milk, dried milk (milk powder), and icecream, using processes such as chill-
ing, pasterization, and homogenization. Typical by-products include buttermilk, 
whey, and their derivatives. Consumer milk includes Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT)1 
milk and pasteurized milk. Tetra Pak concentrates on UHT milk in the China mar-
ket. Currently, UHT milk accounts for 70% of the consumer milk market, while 
pasteurized milk has 30% market share in the consumer milk market. Pasteurized 
</p>
<p>1 UHT milk is the sterilization of milk by heating it for an extremely short period, around 1&ndash;2&nbsp;s, at 
a temperature exceeding 135&nbsp;&deg;C (275&nbsp;&deg;F), which is the temperature required to kill spores in milk, 
giving it a long shelf life of around 9&nbsp;months. Pasteurization is a process of heating a food, usually 
liquid, to a specific temperature for a predefined length of time and then immediately cooling it. 
This process slows spoilage due to microbial growth in the food. Unlike sterilization, pasteuriza-
tion is not intended to kill all micro-organisms in the food. Instead, it aims to reduce the number of 
viable pathogens so they are unlikely to cause disease. It has a refrigerated shelf life of 2&ndash;3&nbsp;weeks.
</p>
<p>F. Jia et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>65
</p>
<p>milk products have distribution restrictions (e.g. short shelf life and refrigeration 
requirements), so are produced and sold mostly by city dairies or at most regional 
players.
</p>
<p>Yili and Mengniu are the two biggest UHT milk producers; the key pasteurized 
milk producers include Bright, New Hope, Sanyuan and Yantang. Mengniu, Yili, 
Bright and Sanyuan are major milk processors nationwide. Mengniu is listed on the 
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd., and the other 3 major milk processors are listed 
in Shanghai Stock Exchange. These four companies accounts for 40&ndash;50% of the 
national market share. Exhibit 4.1 shows the sales volume for these 4 major milk 
processors. There are also about 1000 milk processors at the regional and city lev-
els, which only supply to the areas around their plants.
</p>
<p>According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), over the past 
decade, China&rsquo;s dairy industry has grown at 20% annually, becoming the 4th largest 
dairy producer globally with a small but growing export industry. This growth has 
been fueled by a voracious domestic market which has seen urban consumption of 
milk jump from just short of 5 kilos per capita per&nbsp;annum in 1990 to over 18 kilos 
in 2006, with only around 3% of demand being met by imports. Touted by many as 
China success strories, local brands such as Mengniu, Sanyuan, Yili and Bright 
quickly became industry leaders, contributing to the over RMB 30&nbsp;billion spent by 
the dairy industry in advertising in 2008.
</p>
<p>The rapid growth of dairy products consumption and the dairy industry in China 
wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the UHT technology introduced by Tetra Pak. 
Before that, regional players (e.g. the 6th Plant of Shanghai Dairy Products) flour-
ished in the 1980s through to 1990s. The introduction of UHT technology in the late 
1990s enabled the emergence of national players (e.g. Yili, Mengniu, Bright and 
Sanyuan) and changed the landscape of the liquid dairy market completely. Growth 
of city dairy producers was limited by the rapid expansion of the large national 
brands, and as consumers turned from powder to liquid products, many small pow-
der players were squeezed out of the industry.
</p>
<p>After a decade of strong growth, however, the future of China&rsquo;s dairy industry 
looked uncertain as the melamine2 milk scandal hit newsstands in September 2008. 
Dairy sales fell across China, most notably within the milk powder category at the 
center of the scare. Although the drop in sales indicated that the response from the 
</p>
<p>2 The scandal, also known as the ammonium hydrogen dimmer crisis, caused widespread distrust 
of all domestic dairy brands including Mengniu and Yili. Facing rapidly growing demand for dairy 
products in China, some dairy farmers and raw milk collection stations adulterated the raw milk 
with melamine in order to boost protein levels, and hence the collection prices. Melamine contains 
66% nitrogen but is toxic to humans. Like most other countries, the State and Provincial Food and 
Drug Administration in China used the level of nitrogen as an indicator of the level of protein, 
which is difficult to measure directly. This practice had apparently been widespread amongst dairy 
farmers for some time due to their lack of knowledge about the toxic effects on humans, especially 
when the milk was used in formula for infants. In autumn 2008 six infants died from kidney dam-
age, and more than 800 were hospitalized. It is estimated that adulterated milk products affected 
over 300,000 people, and consumers switched to more expensive but trusted international brands.

</p>
<p>majority of shoppers was to stop purchasing dairy altogether, those that did continue 
to shop within the category tended to favour foreign brands.
</p>
<p>The industry now faces a number of challenges, such as loose links between the 
dairy companies and farms, undeveloped market mechanisms and an ineffective 
management system for raw milk quality. And at the &ldquo;2009 China Dairy Development 
Forum&rdquo;, there was an appeal to maintain a sustainable development for China&rsquo;s 
dairy industry through three main strategies: (1) building a good social environment 
for China&rsquo;s dairy industry to achieve the healthy development of the industry; (2) 
gradual development from a fragmented business to an integrated one; and (3) 
establishing a sound regulatory framework.
</p>
<p>In China, the dairy supply chain is highly fragmented, with millions of dairy 
farmers supplying to big milk processors, a typical &ldquo;Y&rdquo; shape structure. The big 
milk processors are normally the focal companies in the supply chain. Dairy farm-
ers and packaging suppliers are the upstream part of the supplier chain. The down-
stream part of the supply chain consists of various distributors, retailers (shopping 
malls, retail shops and dairy shops, etc.) and consumers (See Exhibit 4.2).
</p>
<p> Major Dairy Producers in China
</p>
<p> Yili
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (Yili) is one of Tetra Pak&rsquo;s largest 
customers. It is also one of the largest dairy products manufacturers with the broad-
est product line in China. Yili started from a state owned dairy producer in 1982 and 
was privatized in 1992. Yili was designated as the sole dairy products supplier to the 
Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 and Shanghai Expo 2010, successfully expanding 
its presence nationwide. Yili Group is made up of five business units: liquid milk, 
ice cream, milk powder, yogurt and raw milk. Yili Group has more than 130 branches 
and subsidiaries nationwide. There are more than 1000 series of Yili brand products, 
such as popsicle, ice cream, milk powder, milk tea powder, UHT milk, yoghurt, and 
cheese. The most popular products include classic organic milk, low-lactose nutri-
tion milk, Chang Qing yogurt, Jinlingguan milk powder for infants, and Chocliz ice 
cream etc.
</p>
<p> Mengniu
China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (Mengniu henceforth), established by a 
former executive of Yili in 1999, and its subsidiaries manufacture and distribute 
quality dairy products in China. Its visionary leader, Niu Gengsheng positioned it as 
No.2 dairy producer after Yili at the beginning of its establishment and had a series 
of very successful marketing campaigns associated with China&rsquo;s successful launch 
of the Shenzhou manned spaceship in 2003. It is one of the leading dairy product 
manufacturers in China, with &lsquo;Mengniu&rsquo; as the core brand. The Group boasts a 
diverse product range including liquid milk products, (such as UHT milk, milk bev-
erages and yogurt), ice cream, and other dairy products (such as milk powder). The 
Group has held the top spot in the China dairy market in terms of overall sales 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>67
</p>
<p>volume and sales volume of liquid milk products since 2006. The main product of 
Mengniu is UHT milk.
</p>
<p> Bright
Bright Dairy &amp; Food Co., Ltd. (Bright henceforth) is a listed joint-stock enterprise 
specializing in the development, production and sales of milk and dairy products, 
the rearing and fostering of milk cows and stud bulls, and the development, produc-
tion and sales of health and nutrition products. The top two stockholders of Bright 
are Shanghai Dairy Group Co. Ltd. and Bright Group Co. Ltd. Danone, the France- 
based food company, was one of Bright&rsquo;s major stockholders, but sold its shares in 
October 2007. Bright boasts a world-class dairy product research and development 
center, dairy product processing facilities, and advanced processing techniques, and 
has developed various product lines including pasteurized milk, yoghurt, UHT 
milk, milk powder, butter and cheese, and fruit juices. It is one of the largest dairy 
production and sales companies in China. The main product of Bright is pasteurized 
milk.
</p>
<p> Sanyuan
Sanyuan Group (Sanyuan henceforth) is a state-owned group of companies based 
on agriculture and animal husbandry in China. It consists of 12 state farms, 20 pro-
fessional companies, 41 transnational joint ventures, 3 overseas subsidiaries and 1 
public company as Beijing Sanyuan Foods, which is listed in Shanghai Stock 
Exchange. Sanyuan was one of the few companies which were clean in the melamine 
milk scandal in 2008.
</p>
<p>All the above players apart from Sanyaun were involved in the 2008 Melamine 
scandal in various degrees, and the national dairy industry as a whole suffered from 
this.
</p>
<p> More Milk Safety Incidents
</p>
<p>In February 2009, Mengniu&rsquo;s Telunsu (brand name) milk was reported for contain-
ing Osteoblast Milk Protein (OMP, Chinese: 造骨牛奶蛋白), In February 2009, the 
safety of OMP was questioned by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, 
Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), the national quality supervision department in 
China, when they were doing a general clean-up on the use of food additives after 
the 2008 melamine scandal. Mengniu first stated that the major active ingredient in 
OMP is Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), but later denied adding IGF-1 and said 
that OMP is the same as Milk Basic Protein (MBP). IGF-1 could possibly cause 
cancer in extreme doses. Mengniu stopped adding OMP to its milk on February 2nd 
2009, after a government order, but did not recall products already on the market. 
On February 13th 2009, the Ministry of Health stated that OMP is &ldquo;not harmful to 
human health&rdquo;, but the ban on its use stayed in place because the importer had not 
submitted the necessary paperwork.

</p>
<p>In June 2012, Yili recalled mercury-tainted baby formula milk after an &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; 
level of mercury was found by the country&rsquo;s product quality watchdog. A spokes-
person from the local quality supervision bureau in Inner Mongolia said that two 
samples from Yili were found with mercury concentration of 0.034&nbsp; mg/Kg and 
0.045&nbsp;mg/kg (BBC news).
</p>
<p>In the latest incident (June, 2012), the Bright Dairy &amp; Food Co. posted a recall 
notice on its website after consumers complained online of bad smelling and discol-
ored liquid in the company&rsquo;s 950&nbsp;ml cartons (about a quarter gallon) of Ubest milk. 
A seconds-long mechanical delay during routine maintenance at one of its Shanghai 
factories caused a &ldquo;small amount&rdquo; of alkaline cleaning solution to be flushed into 
300 cartons of milk produced on Monday, the company&rsquo;s notice said (Reuters).
</p>
<p> Tetra Pak Global
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak is a multinational food packaging and processing company of Swedish 
origin with head offices in Lund, Sweden and Lausanne, Switzerland. The company 
offers packaging solutions, filling machines and processing solutions for dairy, bev-
erages, cheese, ice-cream and prepared food, including distribution tools like accu-
mulators, cap applicators, conveyors, crate packers, film wrappers, line controllers 
and straw applicators. Tetra Pak is currently the largest food packaging company in 
the world by sales, operating in more than 170 countries and with over 22,000 
employees. Tetra Pak produces carton packaging for both UHT and pasteurized 
milk, but has a leading worldwide market share of over 70% in terms of number of 
packs in the narrowly defined aseptic carton packaging segment for UHT milk. As 
Tetra Pak&rsquo;s ex CEO Nick Schreiber put it, Tetra Pak is a big fish in a small pond. 
Tetra Pak was founded by Dr. Ruben Rausing in Lund, Sweden, in 1951 as a subsid-
iary to &Aring;kerlund &amp; Rausing, a food carton company established in Malm&ouml; in 1929 
by Ruben Rausing and Erik &Aring;kerlund. Tetra Pak was built on an innovation by Erik 
Wallenberg, the tetrahedron package, from which the company name was derived. 
The late 1960s and 1970s saw a global expansion of the company, much due to the 
new Tetra Brik Aseptic package, launched in 1969, which opened up new markets 
in the developing world and sparked off a virtual explosion in sales. In the Tetra 
Laval annual report 2010/2011, Tetra Pak announced particularly strong growth in 
China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Central and South America.
</p>
<p> Mission, Strategy and Sustainability
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak&rsquo;s mission and vision reflects its view of sustainable development. Tetra 
Pak&rsquo;s mission is &ldquo;&hellip; to making food safe and available, everywhere&rdquo;. And their 
vision is to &ldquo;&hellip;work for and with our customers to provide preferred processing and 
packaging solutions for food. We apply our commitment to innovation, our under-
standing of consumer needs and our relationships with suppliers to deliver these 
solutions, wherever and whenever food is consumed. We believe in responsible 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>69
</p>
<p>industry leadership, creating profitable growth in harmony with environmental sus-
tainability and good corporate citizenship.&rdquo; The company defines its corporate strat-
egy as &ldquo;to actively build and support partnerships for development; to employ the 
knowledge, products and expertise of Tetra Pak in development projects; to build 
local capacity and ensure sustainability by working actively with knowledge shar-
ing and training; to support the development of high nutrition and cost effective 
products.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Different milk products use different packaging. As of 2011, Tetra Pak has 
around 70% market share in UHT white milk in the aseptic carton packaging. For 
pasteurized milk, Evergreen Packaging, formerly known as International Paper, is 
the key player, with about 60% market share.
</p>
<p>Aseptic packaging technology is Tetra Pak&rsquo;s key innovation and has to a large 
extent paved the way for the Tetra Pak system&rsquo;s success. In aseptic processing the 
product and the package are sterilized separately and then combined and sealed in a 
sterilized environment, as compared to canning, where product and package are 
combined and then sterilized. When filled with ultra-heat treated (UHT) foodstuffs 
(liquids like milk and juice or processed food like vegetables and preserved fruit 
particulates), the aseptic packages can be preserved without chilling for up to 1&nbsp;year, 
with the result that distribution and storage costs, as well as the environmental 
impact, is greatly reduced and product shelf life extended. Tetra Pak&rsquo;s most popular 
product is the Tetra Brik Aseptic, a best-seller since the 1970s. Exhibit 4.3 shows 
the key aseptic packaging produced by Tetra Pak. Tetra Pak cartons also have the 
advantage of consisting of 75% renewable resources, i.e., forest based fiber, making 
it the package with lowest carbon footprint, compared to plastic or metal packages. 
From a material perspective, Tetra Pak cartons are 100% recyclable and the carton 
recycling technologies are mature in most developed markets.

<p>Despite the overall environmental advantages, Tetra Pak cartons have been criti-
cized for being more difficult to recycle than tin cans and glass bottles, and recy-
cling tends to be the most visible environmental issue for the general public. The 
difficulty lies in the fact that the process demands specific recycling plants that are 
not available in some markets and that if not recycled, the cartons may end up in 
landfills that are highly polluting and wasteful. The company has therefore put in 
place measures to reduce its overall impact on the environment, among them a car-
bon management plan.
</p>
<p> Tetra Pak China and Competition
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak started its business in China in 1972, when for the first time, Tetra Pak 
exhibited in China, at the Beijing Trade Fair. To date, Tetra Pak has 4 packaging 
material conversion plants in Beijing, Foshan, Kunshan and Hohhot and 10 sales 
offices in China. Its Chinese business accounts for over 10% of Tetra Pak&rsquo;s global 
sales. Exhibit 4.4 shows the milestones of Tetra Pak in China.

<p> Tetra Pak&rsquo;s Competitors in China
</p>
<p> GA Pack (ga-pack.com)
Greatview Aseptic Packaging Co., Ltd. (GA Pack) is the second largest supplier of 
roll- fed aseptic packaging material globally. The company operates at multiple 
locations across China, Europe, North and South America.
</p>
<p>GA Pack traces its origins to late 2001 and the Tralin Paper Group in Shandong 
province (山东泉林纸业集团). State-of-the-art equipment was imported from 
Germany and Italy and a division for aseptic packaging material production was 
established. During the first couple of years the business expanded gradually with 
only smaller local dairy and beverage manufacturers as customers.
</p>
<p>In 2003 the potential of Tralin&rsquo;s aseptic packaging business was identified by 
entrepreneurs Jeff Bi and Hong Gang, who were former employees of Tetra Pak. 
Drawing on their many years of aseptic packaging experience they could see that 
the business was poised to expand rapidly. A new team of managers was recruited 
and national sales teams started building customer relations across China. In 2005, 
leading dairy companies across China began to use Tralin Pak aseptic packaging 
material in their industry standard roll-fed filling machines. The company initiated 
export sales to Russia, Europe and South America. In November 2010, Tralin Pak 
changed its brand to GA Pack. GA Pack employs more than 800 people in 5 loca-
tions across China and in some European countries since 2010. On 9th December 
2010, GA Pack successfully announced listing on the Main Board of Hong Kong 
Stock Exchange.
</p>
<p>To date GA Pack has gained the attention of foreign equity investors. CDH 
Investments became the first major investor in Tralin Pak. In 2006, US Private 
Equity investor Bain Capital joined as a major investor in GA Pack and the com-
pany&rsquo;s capitalization reached US$ 60&nbsp;million. GA Pack&rsquo;s management remained 
major shareholders, while the company had gained sufficient financial strength as it 
enters the critical growth phase. The company ranks as the second largest roll-fed 
supplier of aseptic packaging globally in 2009. The company&rsquo;s accumulated experi-
ence in aseptic packaging material manufacturing has exceeded 12&nbsp;billion packages. 
It had about 9.6% of the aseptic packaging market share in 2011. Some of the Tetra 
Pak customers use GA Pack as a leveraging tool when negotiating with Tetra Pak, 
since GA Pack&rsquo;s price is about 10&ndash;15% lower than that of the Tetra Pak depending 
on volume.
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak is not only facing the competition from other paper-aluminum packag-
ing suppliers, but is also facing the challenging from the suppliers for other milk 
packaging, like glass bottles, plastics, metal containers, etc. While Tetra Pak takes a 
leading position in UHT white milk, most of its customers market both UHT and 
pasteurized dairy products. The popularity of either UHT milk or pasteurized milk 
among consumers also shapes the future of the overall dairy market, and thus the 
market situation of Tetra Pak.

</p>
<p> Evergreen
Evergreen, formerly known as International Paper (IP), is the world&rsquo;s largest pro-
ducer of plastic lids and paper cups, manufacturing for the fast-food giants 
McDonald&rsquo;s, Wendy&rsquo;s, Subway and coffee giant Starbucks. The Wood Products 
division of International Paper was sold in 2007 to West Fraser Timberland Inc., a 
company headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. The company currently produces 
printer and copier paper, envelopes, corrugated packaging and shipping containers, 
consumer packaging for cosmetics, home entertainment and other retail markets, 
and food service packaging. It also owns XPEDX, a large North American distribu-
tion and logistics company.
</p>
<p>The liquid food (beverage) packaging business of IP was sold to the Rank Group 
and renamed Evergreen in 2007. The beverage packaging business includes wholly 
owned subsidiaries in China, South Korea and Taiwan, and joint ventures in Latin 
America, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.
</p>
<p>In China, Evergreen controls 60% of the market share for pasteurized milk pack-
aging. Evergreen&rsquo;s customers overlap with those of Tetra Pak, with key customers 
such as Bright, New Hope, Sanyuan and Yantang. In 2011, two major customers of 
Tetra Pak, Mengniu and Yili, also became its customers. Mr. Lin Pi, the marketing 
director of Evergreen China said, &ldquo;&hellip;the consumption for pure pasteurized milk 
will definitely increase in China. Evergreen is the professional packaging supplier 
for pure pasteurized milk, while Tetra Pak focuses on packaging for UHT milk. We 
feel confident in gaining the market. If Tetra Pak produces in large scale the packag-
ing for pasteurized milk, there will be direct competition between us and TP.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak&rsquo;s future depends largely on sustained growth of the dairy industry in 
China, especially on the two leading companies, Yili and Mengniu. Some dairy 
experts believe that pasteurized milk will gain more market share in the near future. 
Bright, the market leader in the pasteurized milk segment, lost its No. 1 position in 
China&rsquo;s dairy industry in 2003 and fell behind Yili and Mengniu. However, if Bright 
can regain its leading position with the aid of pasteurized milk, its strategic partner, 
Evergreen, will inevitably challenge Tetra Pak&rsquo;s market position.
</p>
<p> SIG Combibloc
SIG Combibloc Packaging is one of the world&rsquo;s leading system suppliers of carton 
packaging (No.2&nbsp;in aseptic packaging after TP) and filling machines for beverages 
and food. The company supplies complete systems including both the packaging 
materials and the corresponding filling machines therefore is also a major competi-
tor of TP.&nbsp;The then Swiss based company was acquired in 2007 by the same Rank 
group that bought Evergreen.
</p>
<p>SIG Combibloc started its business in China in 1985 but developed slowly. It has 
two offices in China and its first manufacturing facility was built in 2004&nbsp;in Suzhou. 
The company aims to expand its business significantly in China. Its customers 
include Yili and Mengniu.

</p>
<p> Other Competitors
There are also indirect competitors who produce other forms of packaging for dairy 
products, such as glass and plastic bottles, which normally contain pasteurized 
milk. Because of a view that sterilization adversely affects the taste and quality of 
the product, it is possible that the market share of UHT milk will drop in the future. 
As a result, although Tetra Pak currently dominates the aseptic packaging market, it 
faces competition from both growing aseptic packaging suppliers and from other 
suppliers of alternative packaging methods.
</p>
<p> Environmental Challenge of TP&rsquo;s Packaging
</p>
<p>The brick-shaped Tetra Brik and the pillow-shaped Tetra Fino Aseptic are classic 
packagings in China&rsquo;s dairy market (pictures in Exhibit 4.5). In comparision to 
alternatives such as plastic and glass bottles, Tetra Brick and Tetra Fino Aseptic 
have lower carbon footprints due to the use of mainly renewable resources, and 
advantageous environmental performance when taking a lifecycle point of view, 
e.g., higher storage volume; ease for packing, transportation and storage, protection 
of food over a long period of time, etc. Tetra Pak cartons are made of a 6-layer com-
posite, which contains paper, aluminium and polyethylene (see Exhibit 4.6). Hence 
the Tetra packaging can effecitvely prevent air and light, so as to keep milk or bever-
age from deterioration.
</p>
<p>However, according to the belief of many Chinese dairy experts, Tetra Pak car-
tons are less environmentally friendly compared to the cartons for pasterized prod-
ucts. They believe that as aseptic cartons are laminated with layers of paper, 
aluminium and polyethylene, they are not bio-degradable when waste cartons are 
sent to landfill, while cartons for chilled products made from paper and polyethe-
lene are supposedly bio- degradable. While the reasoning of such belief is debat-
able, it is widely spread and supported by people who have a nostalgic sympathy for 
local brands selling pasterized products, who are suffering from the intesified com-
petition from national UHT players.
</p>
<p> Service-Based Sustainability Strategy at Tetra Pak
</p>
<p> KAM-the Way of Working with Customers
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak has in-depth knowledge and experience of the whole dairy value chain- 
from dairy cow to consumer. It considers itself a service provider and provides an 
integrated business solution to customers as a way to shape the structure of the value 
chain. Tetra Pak provides services spanning order processing, technical service and 
marketing support. It also provides business consulting service to their customers. 
Together with its sister company DeLaval, Tetra Pak define itself as &ldquo;a full service 
supplier to dairy farmers, and uniquely positioned to support the development of the 
</p>
<p>F. Jia et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>73
</p>
<p>entire dairy sector in any country.&rdquo; Its value chain activities touch multiple tiers of 
suppliers and customers.
</p>
<p>By combining training of farmers and support for market development with con-
sumer education activities, Tetra Pak helps establish a starting point for sustainable 
economic development. It promotes school milk programs to create demand for 
local agricultural products. Meanwhile, Tetra Pak also provides technical support to 
its customers.
</p>
<p>Since entering the Chinese market, Tetra Pak realizes that its success depends 
largely on the success of its customers; hence it collaborates closely with them. Key 
Account Management (KAM) is the main link in its collaboration with customers. 
Tetra Pak will send a KAM team to a new customer&rsquo;s plant. Led by a key account 
manager, the KAM team consists of members from several functions, such as stra-
tegic development, technology, quality development, sales and administration and 
provide training on all aspects of customers&rsquo; business activities as required.
</p>
<p>When TP began to work with Yili in 1996, Yili bought its first filling machine 
from Tetra Pak and started producing UHT milk. The ability of UHT milk to survive 
long distance transportation allowed the company to expand to new markets across 
China. By 2000, the Chinese dairy market was no longer a patchwork of small pas-
teurized milk producers each dominant in its local market. With UHT milk, Yili 
expanded its business from Inner Mongolia to a nation-wide market; and it exceeded 
Bright in terms of sales volume in 2004. To date, Yili has purchased more than 200 
filling machines from Tetra Pak and annually purchases more than 10&nbsp;billion packs. 
After 15&nbsp;years, the cooperation between Yili and Tetra Pak has expanded from mere 
equipment and packs to marketing, staff training, technical innovation, and product 
development.
</p>
<p>TP adopted a similar way to work with Mengniu, the major competitor of Yili 
started in 1999 by a former Yili executive. At the beginning of its cooperation with 
Mengniu, instead of just focusing on selling packaging products, Tetra Pak helped 
Mengniu plan its plants, production lines, product development and marketing. 
After analysing the market situation then with TP, Mengniu decided to focus on 
UHT milk. This concentration differentiated Mengniu from Yili, who were more 
diversified in UHT milk, milk powder, and milk-tea powder. By 2007, Mengniu 
became No. 1&nbsp;in China both in terms of liquid milk sales volume and total sales 
volume.
</p>
<p> Working with Stakeholders
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak also works closely with the other stakeholders, who are not normally 
involved in traditional dairy supply chains or have direct business relationships with 
TP.&nbsp;They include NGOs (e.g. WWF China) and China Green Foundation (cgf.org.
cn), universities, government institutions, dairy farmers, forest owners, and even the 
garbage collectors.

</p>
<p> FSC Certification
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak promotes renewable resources as production inputs. One key component 
of carton packages is wood-based paper. Tetra Pak instituted a Forestry Guideline to 
ensure better forest management practices even though TP does not have direct 
business relationship with forestry companies in China. Tetra Pak&rsquo;s ultimate goal is 
that the wood fibre it uses comes from responsibly managed forests certified by the 
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Since 2006, Tetra Pak has been working with 
WWF and the China Green Foundation (CGF) to provide support for China&rsquo;s for-
ests to build local sustainable forest management systems and to gain FSC certifica-
tion. In July 2008 over 100,000 hectares of Yong An Forestry in Fujian province 
obtained FSC certification, bringing the total area of FSC-certified forests in China 
to over 700,000 hectares and making China a leader in this area in Asia. Yong An 
was selected for several reasons: first, WWF and TP focused on these southern for-
ests because reform is particularly challenging as many of the forests are collec-
tively owned by villagers or contracted to families, all of whom have to be persuaded 
to practice new forestry approaches. Second Yong An had an exemplary forest man-
agement record and was recommended by the State Forestry Administration. In this 
case, TP funded the certification and expenses of the involvement of other stake-
holders (ministries, academics and the expert team from China).
</p>
<p>In 2010, with an aim of replicating what was done with Yong An Forestry, Tetra 
Pak provided support for responsible forest management and certification work in 
the Tengchong forest in Yunnan Province. Tetra Pak introduced aseptic cartons 
bearing the label of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in China from July, 2010.
</p>
<p> Pasture Land Management
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak&rsquo;s initiatives to support the Chinese dairy industry date back to 1985, when 
DeLaval and Tetra Pak established the Sino-Sweden Dairy Industry Centre to pro-
vide instruction on aseptic filling lines and other related technologies. Through the 
Sino- Sweden Dairy Industry Centre and other activities such as the &ldquo;Green Leaves&rdquo; 
program and &ldquo;Stars of Dairy Industry,&rdquo; Tetra Pak has developed thousands of tech-
nical experts and managers for the industry.
</p>
<p>A bigger challenge lay in persuading Chinese consumers to drink more milk. The 
National School Milk Program and the &ldquo;World Milk Day&rdquo; events are key educa-
tional initiatives supported by Tetra Pak. In 2000, the first conference of National 
Student Milk Coordination Committee (known as milk office or Guo Jia Nai Ban) 
launched a series of policies promoting the &lsquo;Student Milk Programme&rsquo;, and estab-
lished a committee to coordinate and represent 8 ministries and bureaus with an 
interest in the dairy industry: Ministry of Agriculture, the Publicity Department of 
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, National Development 
and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, 
Ministry of Treasury, the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, and 
State Bureau of Light Industry.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>75
</p>
<p>In 2003, the &lsquo;Upgrade plan for the student milk pasturelands&rsquo; was launched to 
create a system of pastureland management integrating modern western manage-
ment systems adapted to the reality in China; develop exemplar pasturelands; and 
thus to provide enough high quality milk for the &lsquo;Student milk programme&rsquo; and 
create positive influence on the dairy industry as a whole.
</p>
<p>In order to support raw milk development in a more systematic way, in January 
2008 at the &lsquo;2008 China Dairy Development Forum&rsquo;, Tetra Pak announced the 
launch of the &ldquo;Tetra Pak Raw Milk Support Program&rdquo;. The intention was to call for 
government and media attention to the critical issues in the dairy value chain by 
demonstrating its own commitment and actions. The subsequent Raw Milk Support 
Program includes four main areas:
</p>
<p>First, the &ldquo;Renda-Tetra Pak Dairy Research Centre&rdquo; was jointly established by 
Tetra Pak and the Renmin University of China (&lsquo;Renda&rsquo; for short). This is a strategic 
partnership aiming to conduct a full-scale study across the country with dairy farms, 
cooperatives, and dairy farming families in order to find the most appropriate way 
of transition to modern farming. For instance, in total 10 R &amp; D sites at cooperatives 
have been established for follow-up studies.
</p>
<p>Second, Tetra Pak trained government officials in charge of dairy farming at 
grass roots level. During the past 3&nbsp;years, 160 local officials from 30 raw milk- 
producing counties have participated in the training.
</p>
<p>Third, Tetra Pak launched the &lsquo;Virtual Dairy Farmers School&rsquo; in collaboration 
with the Dairy Association of China (dac.com.cn) and the China Central Television 
Station with the purpose of helping farmers improve their technical knowledge. By 
2012, the project had carried out on-site trainings in more than 10 provinces, and 
over 6000 dairy farmers had attended the classes and received instructions from 
dairy experts invited by Tetra Pak. Short film footage, specialised TV programmes 
and DVDs is expected to have reached about 48&nbsp;million people.
</p>
<p>Building on the Phase I activities of the &lsquo;Sino-Sweden Dairy Industry Centre&rsquo; 
established by Tetra Pak and its sister company DeLaval in 1985, Tetra Pak China 
launched the Phase II activities, providing &lsquo;Dairy Farming Proficiency training&rsquo;, 
including hands-on instruction to help managers and engineers of large-scale 
ranches to increase the efficiency of breeding, feeding, calving, milking, veterinary 
practices, and farm operations.
</p>
<p>Fourth, by the end of 2011, with the support of Tetra Pak, 101 examplar pasture-
lands had passed the audit from the national milk office (Nai Ban). It is expected 
that the number will reach 200 by 2014. These Examplars were developed with the 
help of training workshops in each region and direct guidance from training experts 
for a period of 3&nbsp;months. Then a team of three experts (different from those provid-
ing training) audit the pasturelands and provide reports to the milk office on whether 
they have reached the standards set by the steering committee. Tetra Pak initiated 
provided financial support in the form of expert travel expenses, expert fees and the 
writing of two handbooks etc. throughout the process. A designated team led by a 
&lsquo;Student Milk Programme Manager&rsquo; within Tetra Pak China has been implementing 
the programme.

</p>
<p> Creating a Recycling System
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak refers to used but non-recycled cartons as &ldquo;Misplaced Resources&rdquo;, and 
faces increasing criticism from environmental groups and the media. In the mean-
time, it has to confront competition from packaging alternatives such as glass and 
plastic. While data shows carbon dioxide emission for a 1 liter Tetra carton is 60&ndash;90 
grams and that of a same-volume plastic package is 115&ndash;199 gram, and 230&ndash;250 
grams for a glass package, the sheer quantity of TP packages still pose a serious 
environmental issue. Tetra Pak cartons have been criticized for being more difficult 
to recycle than tin cans and glass bottles.
</p>
<p>The difficulty lies in the fact that the recycling processes, infrastructure and 
equipment are often not well established. Tetra Pak is currently working with vari-
ous stakeholders including municipalities and recyclers around the world to build 
up this recycling infrastructure. They also seek ways to make recycling easier by: 
(1) designing packages with recyclability in mind; (2) cooperating with customers, 
municipalities, NGOs, industry groups and community associations to ensure Tetra 
packages are recovered effectively; (3) recycling Tetra Pak&rsquo;s own manufacturing 
waste and supporting customers&rsquo; initiatives to recycle theirs; (4) working with sci-
entific institutions and recyclers to develop new recycling technologies; (5) sending 
Tetra Pak&rsquo;s engineers to paper mills worldwide, to help run tests and demonstrate 
the value of recycling cartons; (6) incorporating recycling performance into the per-
formance evaluation of local managers.
</p>
<p>In China, Tetra Pak works with recycling companies, schools, NGOs, waste col-
lectors, industry associations and central and local governments to help establish a 
sustainable collection and recycling system. Recycling levels increased from almost 
nothing in 2004 to about 20% in 2011, when approximately 90,144 tons of used 
packages were recycled in China, which is equivalent to around 9&nbsp;billion packs of 
standard cartons.
</p>
<p>Although the recycling rate increases quickly in China, in comparison to global 
average recycling rate (30%) and the high recycling rate in some of the EU coun-
tries (70%), the recycling rate in China is still low. A &lsquo;Circular economy&rsquo; law was 
enacted in 2009, reinforcing the impetus for recycling. Tetra Pak is well aware that 
a circular economy can only be achieved if there is a healthy ecosystem within 
which the economy thrives; and that the success of recycling schemes depends on 
the commitment and cooperation of all stakeholders. Furthermore, Tetra Pak needs 
to (1) identify where its support can be most useful&nbsp;&ndash; in areas like technology devel-
opment, the growth of recycling infrastructure and increased consumer awareness; 
(2) establish a carton collection system in China where there is currently a rather 
vague waste classification system; (3) Collaborate with China Packaging Federation, 
which represents the government, to monitor the packaging industry.
</p>
<p>Tetra Pak takes three steps to promote the establishment of a carton recycling 
industry in China. First, it works with recycling partners to establish recycling 
capacity. Tetra Pak provides recyclers four types of recycling technologies (see 
Exhibit 4.7) and sometimes also financial support for capacity expansion.
</p>
<p>F. Jia et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>77
</p>
<p>Next, Tetra Pak provides technical support to encourage recycling partners to 
improve technology and end product value so that the recyclers can offer higher 
price for the used cartons in comparison to waste paper. Tetra Pak also provides 
waste packages from its production process as an additional input.
</p>
<p>Most of the recyclers working with Tetra Pak are not large in size, but they all 
have potential to grow. For example Beijing Xin Hong Peng Paper Co. Ltd. pro-
cesses about 10,000 ton of waste packages every year, with annual output of about 
6000 tons of recycled paper and 250 tons of aluminium powders. Moreover, by 
using new thechnolgies to separate the PolyAl (plastic and aluminium)3 materials in 
cartons, the value of recycled materials has increased by nearly a third. As a conse-
quence Xin Hong Peng plans to expand its waste handling capacity to 30,000 tons 
per year.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, Tetra Pak helps establish the collection network by training waste col-
lectors and promoting public awareness of carton recyclability. Waste cartons are 
usually gathered by scavengers, often migrants to the cities. In Beijing, Tetra Pak 
provided collection training for these collectors, cleaners and dealers, in coopera-
tion with a waste management company. With the joint effort from the recycling 
partners, the price of used Tetra Pak cartons increases to the same as or even exceed 
the price of used cardboard box, which obviously increases the motivation of collec-
tors. When the financial crisis entered its second year in 2009, the price of the used 
Tetra Pak carton surpassed the price of waste paper in China. The peak price of used 
Tetra Pak containers reached RMB 1500 per ton in 2009; it dropped to around RMB 
1000 since then while the ordinary waste paper price is around RMB 700&ndash;800.
</p>
<p>To further enhance the economic sustainability of the recycling value chain, 
Tetra Pak also introduced HB clad plate (&ldquo;Caile plate&rdquo; 彩乐板) technology4 and 
plastic-wood composites technology to its business partners. This has been widely 
adopted and there are now many cities in China using garbage bins made from 
plastic-wood, an ideal substitute for metal ones, which are often stolen. Plastic- 
wood composite technology also provides construction materials for flooring, and 
garden furniture that is popular in South-east Asian markets.
</p>
<p>To date, there are more than 10 companies producing recycled materials from 
used Tetra Pak cartons in China, and a recycling value chain is taking shape (see 
Exhibit 4.7). Tetra Pak wants to double its recycling rate of cartons from 20% in 
2010 to 40% by 2020 globally. Their experience in China proves it can be done, 
even in a market lacking clear waste management legislation.
</p>
<p>3 When the paper pulp is removed from the waste, a mixture of plastic and aluminium remains. This 
use to fetch a rice of around 1200/ton. In 2007, Tetra Pak cooperated with Shandong Tianyi Plastic 
Co. Ltd. and Shangdong Liaocheng University to develop a Chinese version of PolyAl, the tech-
nology to separate the plastic and aluminium. In 2009, PolyAl separation technology was com-
mercialized in China. As a result, the aluminium and plastic components can be separated with a 
purity of 99.5%. The separated plastic grains can be sold at a price of about RMB 2000/ton, and 
the aluminium can be sold at about RMB 9000/ton.
4 HB clad plate technology: HB clad plate is made by crushing used Tetra Pak cartons and process-
ing the material with thermo-compression. HB clad plate can be manufactured into various prod-
ucts, such as rubbish bins, said to be nice looking, endurable and low in cost.

<p>5INEOS ChlorVinyls: A Positive Vision for PVC (A)
N. Craig Smith and Dawn Jarisch
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Following a Greenpeace campaign in the late 1990s to boycott PVC products 
</p>
<p>because of environmental concerns, Hydro Polymers Limited decided to embrace 
</p>
<p>the challenge and work with The Natural Step (TNS), an international non-profit 
</p>
<p>organisation promoting a scientific, whole-systems approach to sustainability 
</p>
<p>(Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development; FSSD).1 TNS spurred and 
</p>
<p>assisted Hydro Polymers on its journey towards sustainability, a proactive approach 
</p>
<p>that produced pioneering innovations, incorporated sustainability into the overall 
</p>
<p>business, and generated major cost savings.
</p>
<p>In 2007, Hydro Polymers was acquired by INEOS ChlorVinyls, Europe&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>largest PVC manufacturer. Aware that the rest of the European PVC producers 
</p>
<p>were taking a less radical approach, the new parent company insisted that any 
</p>
<p>drive to sustainability be part of a Europe-wide cross-company programme. 
</p>
<p>For Dr. Jason Leadbitter, Sustainability Manager at INEOS ChlorVinyls, a 
</p>
<p>passionate advocate of taking a more proactive sustainability approach since 
</p>
<p>2000, the challenge was to convince the new management, the customer and 
</p>
<p>the wider PVC community to embrace sustainability. Could the tangible prog-
</p>
<p>ress to date persuade them that an industry-wide transition to sustainable PVC 
</p>
<p>1 The Natural Step has developed its work around the world and has been key for the development 
</p>
<p>of a science-based methodology for strategic sustainable development for more than 20&nbsp;years. This 
</p>
<p>methodology is available to all, continues to be developed in a scientific process, and is known as 
</p>
<p>the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD). See, for example, Rob&egrave;rt K-H.,

</p>
<p>was realistic and that the above- mentioned approach was the best way to 
</p>
<p>accelerate the pace of change in the industry?
</p>
<p> How It All Started
</p>
<p>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was the material of choice for many consumer and indus-
</p>
<p>trial purposes, as it was durable, light weight and economical. But for Greenpeace, 
</p>
<p>PVC was a highly toxic material to manufacture and dispose of. In August 1996, 
</p>
<p>shortly after Leadbitter took on the role of Environmental Manager at Hydro 
</p>
<p>Polymers, he was stunned to see a Greenpeace advertisement in the national press 
</p>
<p>entitled &lsquo;Saving our skins&rsquo; criticising the PVC retail market (see Exhibit 5.1). 
</p>
<p>Demonstrations outside retail stores were staged to raise public awareness and gain 
</p>
<p>support for the idea of regulations to eliminate PVC, by being phased out in the 
</p>
<p>same way as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). In an effort to counter these claims, the 
</p>
<p>European PVC resin industry, which represented 25% of a global PVC resin market 
</p>
<p>worth &euro;20&nbsp;billion, was accused of deception and threatened with a boycott.
</p>
<p>The PVC manufacturing process combined ethylene, derived from natural gas, 
</p>
<p>with chlorine, derived from the electrolysis of salt, to produce an intermediate prod-
</p>
<p>uct known as ethylene dichloride (EDC). This was &ldquo;cracked&rdquo; via a chemical process 
</p>
<p>to produce vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), which was polymerised in water to 
</p>
<p>produce PVC resin. Resin was combined with additives (typically stabilisers, plas-
</p>
<p>ticisers and fillers) in myriad combinations to form PVC compounds. These were 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;converted&rsquo; by processes such as extrusion and moulding into products tailored for 
</p>
<p>different applications.
</p>
<p>Firms which converted PVC compounds into end products for sale or made com-
</p>
<p>ponents for downstream companies were known as &lsquo;converters&rsquo;. The resin industry, 
</p>
<p>additive manufacturers and the compounding/converting sector were collectively 
</p>
<p>referred to as the PVC industry.
</p>
<p>PVC resin production consumed over a third of global chlorine gas production. 
</p>
<p>The energy-intensive process consumed 1% of global electricity production (mostly 
</p>
<p>carbon-based). Older plants were based on mercury cell technology, which released 
</p>
<p>mercury into the environment. By attacking the PVC industry, Greenpeace threat-
</p>
<p>ened the entire chlorine industry. As Pete Roche, a Greenpeace campaigner in the 
</p>
<p>UK, explained: &ldquo;We held actions at various chlorine plants for a few years but got 
</p>
<p>nowhere, so we switched attention to PVC, at the other end of the production chain.&rdquo;2
</p>
<p>Environmentalists argued that plasticisers and stabilisers (responsible for PVC&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>properties such as its flexibility and thermo stability) and the accumulation of by- 
</p>
<p>products from the manufacturing process (primarily dioxins) were unsustainable. 
</p>
<p>They were accused of damaging ecosystems and human health by disrupting the 
</p>
<p>endocrine, reproductive, nervous and immune systems, since they could be emitted 
</p>
<p>into the air, soil and water during production, waste incineration and via leakage 
</p>
<p>from landfill sites. Resistant to natural decomposition, they built up as global pollut-
</p>
<p>ants, were absorbed by living organisms and accumulated in the food chain.

</p>
<p>Eliminating PVC would be disastrous for Hydro, whose main products were 
</p>
<p>PVC resin (representing 80% of turnover) and downstream PVC compounds (20%). 
</p>
<p>Moreover, in 1997, the year after the Greenpeace campaign, it had launched a 
</p>
<p>&pound;30&nbsp;million investment to expand and modernise its PVC resin manufacturing plant 
</p>
<p>at Newton Aycliffe in the UK.
</p>
<p> PVC Coordination Group
</p>
<p>In response to the campaign and other critics, a number of leading UK retailers, 
</p>
<p>including the Body Shop, Tesco, Asda and the Co-op, came together with Greenpeace 
</p>
<p>to form the UK PVC Retail Working Group. The group commissioned a study of 
</p>
<p>PVC by the National Centre for Business and Ecology (NCBE), a partnership 
</p>
<p>between the Co-operative Bank and four UK universities, to investigate the scientific 
</p>
<p>validity of the anti-PVC claims. When the report was published in September 1997, 
</p>
<p>Greenpeace was surprised by its conclusion: &ldquo;The study team concludes on balance 
</p>
<p>that the careful manufacture, use, recycling and disposal of PVC products to the high-
</p>
<p>est standards can control the risks associated with the material to acceptable levels.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The working group was then enlarged to include two UK PVC resin producers, 
</p>
<p>Hydro and EVC, and representatives from the UK Environment Agency and Forum 
</p>
<p>for the Future, a leading environmental think-tank co-founded by Jonathan Porritt, 
</p>
<p>who was asked to chair the group. Forum for the Future had taken on the develop-
</p>
<p>ment of the TNS organisation in the UK.&nbsp; Each time Greenpeace representatives 
</p>
<p>articulated arguments against PVC, Porritt asked them to explain how PVC as such 
</p>
<p>was problematic and why the alternatives were better.
</p>
<p>Greenpeace: &ldquo;There are heavy metals in PVC-production.&rdquo; Porritt: &ldquo;So, what would happen 
</p>
<p>if PVC was manufactured without heavy metals?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Greenpeace: &ldquo;PVC manufacture is an energy-intensive process requiring 1% of global elec-
</p>
<p>tricity production.&rdquo; Porritt: &ldquo;How much energy is used in the manufacture of alternative 
</p>
<p>raw materials?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As it became clear that the (now named) PVC Coordination Group didn&rsquo;t have 
</p>
<p>the answers to these questions, Porritt pushed them to commission a &lsquo;gap analysis&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>using the FSSD and its principles for sustainability. While this was a risk for the 
</p>
<p>PVC industry (companies such as IKEA and the Co-op had used the same method-
</p>
<p>ology arriving at a conclusion to phase out PVC), the principles were based on sci-
</p>
<p>ence, the mistrust and suspicion surrounding PVC had to be dealt with, and Porritt 
</p>
<p>was at least trying to play fair. Hence the resin producers had little choice but to 
</p>
<p>participate in the gap analysis. TNS was engaged to undertake a detailed study of 
</p>
<p>PVC with the theme &ldquo;Does PVC have a place in a sustainable society?&rdquo; This 
</p>
<p>involved all the key stakeholders&nbsp;&ndash; the manufacturing chain, end-users, regulators 
</p>
<p>and NGOs.

</p>
<p> The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development
</p>
<p>The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) has been developed 
</p>
<p>through, and continues to be refined in, a comprehensive scientific process. It was 
</p>
<p>continuously developed and scrutinized theoretically, used and tested in reality, and 
</p>
<p>then refined and scrutinized theoretically again. This process was initiated in 
</p>
<p>Sweden in 1989 by cancer scientist and cancer clinician Professor Karl-Henrik 
</p>
<p>Rob&egrave;rt, who founded The Natural Step (TNS)&nbsp;&ndash; a non-profit NGO with the mission 
</p>
<p>of facilitating a learning dialogue between scientists and business. Frustrated by the 
</p>
<p>prevailing piecemeal approach to addressing environmental problems, Rob&egrave;rt 
</p>
<p>brought leading scientists together to achieve consensus on the basic requirements 
</p>
<p>for a sustainable society. This scientific consensus process has led to basic princi-
</p>
<p>ples for socio-ecological sustainability and a systems-based strategic planning and 
</p>
<p>management framework that is extensively used by business, municipalities and 
</p>
<p>other organizations around the world. In the PVC context, borrowing Rob&egrave;rt&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>words: &ldquo;There are no sustainable materials, just as there are no non-sustainable 
</p>
<p>materials. There are only sustainable and non-sustainable management practices.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The Sustainability Principles are as follows:
</p>
<p>In a sustainable society, nature is not subject to systematically increasing:
</p>
<p> 1. Concentrations of substances extracted from the Earth&rsquo;s crust (such as fossil 
</p>
<p>carbon and metals);
</p>
<p> 2. Concentrations of substances produced by society (such as nitrogen compounds, 
</p>
<p>CFCs, and endocrine disrupters);
</p>
<p> 3. Degradation by physical means (such as deforestation and over-fishing); 
</p>
<p>and, in such a society,
</p>
<p> 4. People are not subject to conditions that systematically undermine their capacity 
</p>
<p>to meet their needs (such as from the abuse of political and economic power).
</p>
<p>The FSSD includes a technique called &lsquo;backcasting&rsquo; (see Exhibit 5.2), which 
</p>
<p>entails creating a vision of success (framed by the sustainability principles) in the 
</p>
<p>future, looking back from that vision to today&rsquo;s situation, and figuring out how to 
</p>
<p>bridge the gap.3 This differs from pure &lsquo;forecasting&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash; which extrapolates from pre-
</p>
<p>vailing trends to the future and then attempts to fix any foreseen problems, an 
</p>
<p>approach that Rob&egrave;rt claims is &ldquo;bound to lead to more problems further ahead and 
</p>
<p>even more confusion&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>Backcasting in the FSSD entails:
</p>
<p>A (Awareness)&nbsp;&ndash; participants learn about the basic principles for human society to 
</p>
<p>be sustainable (using the FSSD), share and discuss the topic or planning endeavor 
</p>
<p>and agree on a vision of success.
</p>
<p>B (Baseline mapping)&nbsp;&ndash; participants explore the current situation. They list the main 
</p>
<p>current challenges in relation to the sustainable vision as well as current assets to 
</p>
<p>deal with those challenges.
</p>
<p>C (Creating possible solutions)&nbsp;&ndash; participants brainstorm possible solutions to the 
</p>
<p>challenges discovered in step B.
</p>
<p>D (Down to action)&nbsp; &ndash; participants prioritise actions developed during step 
</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;Decisions and plans are evaluated for being flexible enough to handle change 
</p>
<p>without losing overall direction, likely to produce progress to the vision, and 
</p>
<p>adequate return on investments.
</p>
<p> July 2000, Consensus-Building Report
</p>
<p>TNS (UK) published its findings in a consensus-building report in July 2000. Having 
</p>
<p>tested PVC in relation to the sustainability principles, the report asked the question&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Is 
</p>
<p>there a place for PVC in a sustainable world?&rdquo; What would it mean for PVC and its man-
</p>
<p>agement to comply with the principles and bridge the gap between the existing situation 
</p>
<p>and the future vision? Based upon in-depth research, and using consensus based work-
</p>
<p>shops for all stakeholders including supporters and opponents, the final report concluded, 
</p>
<p>Exhibit 5.2: Backcasting Approach to PVC

</p>
<p>with the backing of participants, that PVC has a role in a sustainable society provided five 
</p>
<p>specific and systemic challenges for the material and its use, were to be overcome4:
</p>
<p> 1. To become carbon neutral;
</p>
<p> 2. Closed-loop recycling;
</p>
<p> 3. No accumulation of emissions in the environment;
</p>
<p> 4. The industry to adopt sustainable additives;
</p>
<p> 5. Challenging the value chain to collaborate to become more sustainable.
</p>
<p>To the relief of the PVC resin producers, The Natural Step study concluded that 
</p>
<p>although PVC was currently unsustainably managed, none of the five challenges 
</p>
<p>was technologically insurmountable. But even if the potential existed, the industry 
</p>
<p>had to assess whether the challenges could be overcome in a commercially viable 
</p>
<p>way. Porritt averred that,
</p>
<p>PVC may or may not have a place in a genuinely sustainable future (depending on whether 
</p>
<p>or not it can meet the challenges outlined in our evaluation), but exactly the same questions 
</p>
<p>must be asked of all materials, man-made or natural, before leaping to what are often ill- 
</p>
<p>judged and unscientific conclusions.
</p>
<p>Greenpeace, however, insisted that the goals were unattainable and withdrew 
</p>
<p>from the PVC Co-ordination Group.
</p>
<p> Vinyl 2010
</p>
<p>In addition to the pressures from Greenpeace, the European Commission published 
</p>
<p>a green paper, urging the PVC industry to address environmental concerns.5 In 
</p>
<p>response to this, in March 2001, European resin producers and converters made a 
</p>
<p>voluntary 10-year commitment to minimise the environmental impact of produc-
</p>
<p>tion, an industry initiative known as &lsquo;Vinyl 2010&rsquo;.6
</p>
<p>Vinyl 2010 focused on recycling and substitution of heavy metals. With 17&nbsp;mil-
</p>
<p>lion tonnes of plastics entering the waste stream within Europe, and landfill con-
</p>
<p>straints developing in many member states, further pressure to recycle PVC could 
</p>
<p>be expected. Consequently, Vinyl 2010 set a target to recycle 200,000&nbsp;tonnes p.a. of 
</p>
<p>post-consumer PVC waste by 2010. Vinyl 2010 also set a voluntary target for the 
</p>
<p>industry to be lead-free by 2015&nbsp;in the hope of avoiding anticipated European legis-
</p>
<p>lation. Both the recycling and the heavy metal substitution targets set for 2010 were 
</p>
<p>exceeded.

</p>
<p> Hydro Works with The Natural Step
</p>
<p>Leadbitter was convinced that going beyond Vinyl 2010 and embracing the chal-
</p>
<p>lenges of the consensus-building report would not only enable Hydro to pre-empt 
</p>
<p>future regulation but provide a competitive advantage on sustainability issues. It 
</p>
<p>was not an easy decision given the dilemma facing Hydro at the time:
</p>
<p>We had to think whether to build the walls higher or engage with the environmentalists. Do 
</p>
<p>we invite them into the boardroom? Can we get them to sit round the table? This was what 
</p>
<p>we did and it was a changing point in the whole culture and mentality of Hydro.
</p>
<p>Following publication of the consensus-building report, Hydro&rsquo;s President, 
</p>
<p>Anders Hermansson, was keen to meet Rob&egrave;rt. The two men hit it off immediately 
</p>
<p>and agreed to bring in a wider group of managers involved in the PVC resin produc-
</p>
<p>tion process. Rob&egrave;rt and his team at TNS were engaged to undertake a deeper analy-
</p>
<p>sis of what it would take to create a sustainable PVC resin business, and to educate 
</p>
<p>the top 40 managers in The Natural Step approach (the FSSD) and the related five 
</p>
<p>challenges for PVC so that they understood the scale of the task.
</p>
<p>Rob&egrave;rt visited all of the Hydro sites, where he hosted workshops, coached and 
</p>
<p>presented to senior, middle and junior management. Mapping flows of raw materi-
</p>
<p>als and energy, workshop participants were challenged to think about &ldquo;What could 
</p>
<p>we do, in a step-by-step fashion, to make PVC fully sustainable and meet the five 
</p>
<p>key sustainability challenges for Hydro?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In seeking to demonstrate that PVC could be safely manufactured and used, TNS 
</p>
<p>compared itself to a &ldquo;critical friend&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; one who could be trusted to ask provocative 
</p>
<p>questions, provide data to be examined through another lens, and to critique Hydro&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>efforts constructively.
</p>
<p>Eager to inject a stimulus to get sustainability projects off the ground (notably 
</p>
<p>the energy reduction project and any &lsquo;low-hanging fruit&rsquo; which Hydro decided to 
</p>
<p>tackle first) as well as convince the cynics in the company, Hermansson committed 
</p>
<p>to provide NOK25&nbsp;million (approximately &euro;3&nbsp;million) per year for 3&nbsp;years from 
</p>
<p>2002, mainly for longer term projects. This was in addition to normal capital expen-
</p>
<p>diture. A board was set up to allocate funding to the best projects. Additionally, 
</p>
<p>Hermansson instigated an annual Sustainability Summit (that Rob&egrave;rt attended), 
</p>
<p>which allowed dissenters to voice their opinions and concerns. Once won over, they 
</p>
<p>were often among the strongest advocates of the process.
</p>
<p>Once employees got to grips with the framework as a means to achieve the end 
</p>
<p>goal of sustainability, they learnt to plan, act, and apply the approach to their every-
</p>
<p>day work by undertaking manageable short projects. This generated a sense of pur-
</p>
<p>pose and achievement, accelerating the implementation process. From 2001 to 
</p>
<p>2004, senior management gave high priority to sustainability and maintained a close 
</p>
<p>interest in it, inviting Rob&egrave;rt and the TNS team back regularly to scrutinise invest-
</p>
<p>ments, run workshops and education sessions, and give assurance on the steps taken.
</p>
<p>Hydro employees identified and implemented numerous internal initiatives. The 
</p>
<p>five key sustainability challenges were addressed at both the local and Hydro-wide

</p>
<p>level. At any one time there could be four company-wide projects running for each 
</p>
<p>challenge, as well as smaller local projects and further suggestions in the pipeline. 
</p>
<p>Up to 120 people were involved in one or more projects (10% of the workforce). 
</p>
<p>Local teams had five to six people per site/challenge and competition occurred 
</p>
<p>among the scientists. Project leaders posted minutes from their meetings and spread-
</p>
<p>sheets with their creative ideas in a database.
</p>
<p>An annual meeting provided an opportunity for team leaders to pitch their ideas 
</p>
<p>to the board for potential capital investment. To quantify the value of each sustain-
</p>
<p>ability project, they had to provide details such as benefits vs. cost and likelihood of 
</p>
<p>success. For example, for the Carbon Neutrality project (challenge No. 1), local 
</p>
<p>teams were asked to both create and measure ideas of how to reduce carbon emis-
</p>
<p>sions from their plants, prompting a flood of potential project ideas. Employees had 
</p>
<p>apparently thought about this for some time but had never been given the opportu-
</p>
<p>nity for creative thinking (or funding) until carbon neutrality became a strategic 
</p>
<p>priority. Projects were assessed on the basis of the highest CO2 savings per 
</p>
<p>Norwegian Kroner invested. Funding was awarded to projects that provided the best 
</p>
<p>value in this respect in combination with their chances of success.
</p>
<p>The decision to put the company on a path towards sustainability gave individu-
</p>
<p>als the creative freedom to think outside the box. One experienced chemical engi-
</p>
<p>neer came up with a speculative idea known as &ldquo;adiabatic volume&rdquo;, a breakthrough 
</p>
<p>innovation with the potential to increase yield from the VCM cracker without fur-
</p>
<p>ther heat input. Despite the high investment required&nbsp;&ndash; with a payback period up to 
</p>
<p>3&nbsp;years&nbsp;&ndash; estimated savings of 8800&nbsp;tonnes of CO2 per&nbsp;annum meant that the project 
</p>
<p>was executed at a cost of around &pound;1&nbsp;million. Ironically, immediately after installa-
</p>
<p>tion, energy prices soared unexpectedly. Although the carbon savings were margin-
</p>
<p>ally lower than predicted, the payback took less than a year. Within 3&nbsp;years, all three 
</p>
<p>of Hydro&rsquo;s VCM crackers had the new technology, yielding combined savings of 
</p>
<p>&pound;3&nbsp;million and 24,000&nbsp;tonnes of CO2 annually.
</p>
<p>Other projects were less easy to quantify. For example, a project to reduce traces 
</p>
<p>of dioxin formation (Challenge No. 3) proved difficult to quantify, yet this did not 
</p>
<p>prevent significant investment. Some projects were more strategic. For example, 
</p>
<p>phasing out lead stabilisers with more expensive alternatives did not make eco-
</p>
<p>nomic sense, but Hydro was keen to differentiate itself from competitors with lead- 
</p>
<p>based formulations. A couple of projects proved unsuccessful, such as the purchase 
</p>
<p>of two wind turbines for &pound;140,000 which were never put into operation due to objec-
</p>
<p>tions from the local electricity company and problems obtaining planning 
</p>
<p>permission.
</p>
<p>Prior to starting the sustainability journey, every tonne of PVC resin produced by 
</p>
<p>Hydro emitted 1.8&nbsp;tonnes of carbon dioxide. Investments in green energy achieved 
</p>
<p>a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions between 2001 and 2006, reaching Kyoto Protocol 
</p>
<p>targets for 2012&nbsp;in the first 4&nbsp;years.
</p>
<p>Corporate newsletters highlighted the progress toward the five challenges and 
</p>
<p>employees took pride in what was achieved, in contrast to the frustration felt when 
</p>
<p>they had been under attack by Greenpeace. By 2004, when Jan-Sverre Rosstad 
</p>
<p>became Senior Vice-President of Hydro, a significant shift in internal culture had

<p/>

<p>92
</p>
<p>occurred. The annual employee survey (September 2004) reflected a 15% increase 
</p>
<p>in employee recognition of the company&rsquo;s environmental commitment in response 
</p>
<p>to the question &ldquo;Does Hydro put the environment first?&rdquo; Not only were employees 
</p>
<p>buying into the process as a result of actions witnessed first-hand (with visible sup-
</p>
<p>port from top management), but the resulting innovations had reduced some of the 
</p>
<p>risks to which competitors were now exposed.
</p>
<p>Hydro&rsquo;s proactive approach had produced pioneering innovations to address the 
</p>
<p>challenges ahead of its competitors and the regulators. By 2005, sustainability was 
</p>
<p>no longer treated in isolation; targets were fully integrated into the business plan-
</p>
<p>ning process and were generating cost savings. Hydro had demonstrated that the 
</p>
<p>sustainability challenge could be met: it could measure the gap between the current 
</p>
<p>position of PVC resin in relation to the end goal of sustainability, and spell out how 
</p>
<p>it was systematically being closed.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Rosstad wondered how to keep capitalising on Hydro&rsquo;s sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity initiatives as the early wins were realised. For PVC resin to be fully sustainable, 
</p>
<p>the entire value chain would need to align with the sustainability challenges over 
</p>
<p>time. Rosstad felt that Hydro was &ldquo;well positioned for this next phase of the chal-
</p>
<p>lenge, gaining momentum in the marketplace which will hopefully translate into a 
</p>
<p>snowball effect.&rdquo; He decided to embark on the fifth challenge by hosting workshops 
</p>
<p>with suppliers in Hydro&rsquo;s value chain &ldquo;to extend the business benefits of addressing 
</p>
<p>sustainability implications of PVC to a wider range of stakeholders&rdquo; as well as to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;demonstrate PVCs long-term ability in becoming a fully sustainable material&rdquo;.

</p>
<p> The PVC Resin Market in 2005
</p>
<p>In 2005, the global PVC resin market was worth over &euro;36&nbsp;billion, with annual con-
</p>
<p>sumption exceeding 36&nbsp;MT.&nbsp;Over 60% of PVC resin was used in the manufacture of 
</p>
<p>pipes and window frames for the construction sector. Although losing ground across 
</p>
<p>some product applications, global production capacity was expected to exceed 
</p>
<p>40&nbsp;million tonnes by 2010, driven by accelerating demand from Asia. In 2005, Asia 
</p>
<p>accounted for 43% of PVC resin demand, with China increasingly making its influ-
</p>
<p>ence felt. Between 1998 and 2005, China&rsquo;s annual PVC resin consumption had 
</p>
<p>increased from one million to over seven million tonnes. On the supply side, China 
</p>
<p>was ramping up its domestic PVC resin manufacturing capacity with little concern 
</p>
<p>for environmental sustainability. It envisioned production increases of one million 
</p>
<p>tonnes year-on-year from 2006 to 2010, relying on its cheap labour, vast coal 
</p>
<p>reserves, and more energy-intensive and polluting acetylene process technology. 
</p>
<p>This technology had been phased out and replaced by ethylene-based production in 
</p>
<p>Europe in the 1960s.
</p>
<p>It was a cyclical market. PVC resin prices varied from month to month, driven by 
</p>
<p>the price of raw materials and manufacturers seeking to keep capacity utilisation 
</p>
<p>high. Consequently, the value of the market changed each year even if production 
</p>

</p>
<p>capacity and volumes remained static. In Europe, ethylene accounted for half of 
</p>
<p>production costs, with energy costs the next highest cost component.
</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s PVC resin market represented over 25% of global consumption in 
</p>
<p>2005, supplied by ten European producers. European production capacity was 9.1 
</p>
<p>million tonnes. The top 3 producers were INEOS (1.3&nbsp;MT), Solvay (1.2&nbsp;MT) and 
</p>
<p>Arkema (0.8&nbsp;MT). Hydro in fourth place (0.7&nbsp;MT) had the lowest costs in Europe, 
</p>
<p>benefiting from its integrated supply chain. Given the capital-intensive nature and 
</p>
<p>relatively low margins of the sector, this was a significant advantage. In 2005, 
</p>
<p>Hydro&rsquo;s operating income was &euro;8.6 million, while competitor EVC/INEOS7 
</p>
<p>reported losses of &euro;13.2 million.
</p>
<p>For decades, market growth in Western Europe had been driven by applications for 
</p>
<p>door and window frames and pipes, but as the market matured, growth was projected 
</p>
<p>to be only 0.5% per&nbsp;annum to 2008. Running on tight margins, many players wondered 
</p>
<p>how sustainability could be good for business when their only priority was survival.
</p>
<p> Engaging Suppliers and Customers
</p>
<p>Both Leadbitter and Rosstad believed key suppliers must understand Hydro&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>approach to sustainable PVC based on the FSSD if future partnerships to address 
</p>
<p>the sustainability challenges were to succeed. In April 2005, Hydro invited its ten 
</p>
<p>top strategic raw material suppliers to Stenungsund, Sweden, to explain the sustain-
</p>
<p>ability challenges facing PVC and communicate Hydro&rsquo;s strategy. The workshop 
</p>
<p>offered an opportunity for them to grapple with the sustainability implications for 
</p>
<p>their own product development set against the practical realities of creating sustain-
</p>
<p>able products in a commercially viable timeframe.
</p>
<p>Feedback from those attending was positive. Hydro&rsquo;s commitment to sustain-
</p>
<p>ability virtually guaranteed demand for suppliers&rsquo; sustainable product innovations&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>their ideas would be taken seriously because of Hydro&rsquo;s sustainability drive. One 
</p>
<p>company produced a new stabiliser system that offered an alternative to using lead 
</p>
<p>and a reduced environmental footprint. Suppliers also began to develop their own 
</p>
<p>sustainability initiatives. For example, The Natural Step worked extensively with 
</p>
<p>Rohm and Haas, one of Hydro&rsquo;s top strategic suppliers, helping them at strategic 
</p>
<p>and operational levels to apply the FSSD including a new vision and &lsquo;Six 
</p>
<p>Commitments for Sustainability&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Hydro now had to convince its customers that sustainable PVC was a viable 
</p>
<p>long-term option over alternatives such as wood, plastic or aluminium. It had to 
</p>
<p>demonstrate the tangible added-value of its increasingly sustainable PVC resin 
</p>
<p>products, and position the brand accordingly. In March 2006, as Leadbitter and 
</p>
<p>Rosstad prepared for a crucial workshop with Hydro&rsquo;s key UK customers (see 
</p>
<p>Exhibit 5.3). They felt it was time to talk openly about what Hydro had achieved and 
</p>
<p>create demand for further innovations by showcasing its strategy for sustainable 
</p>
<p>PVC and progress to date.

</p>
<p>Would customers understand the process the company had embarked on in 2001, 
</p>
<p>and appreciate the advantage of full sustainability as opposed to the issues-driven 
</p>
<p>approach of its competitors? How could Hydro enhance their perception of Hydro&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>brand without alienating them? If customers weighed up the implications of the sus-
</p>
<p>tainability challenges for the industry, would they contemplate making the transition to 
</p>
<p>fully sustainable PVC or dispute its viability on commercial grounds? If PVC was seen 
</p>
<p>to be a losing battle, they might devise exit strategies to cut their losses. Given the avail-
</p>
<p>ability of alternative materials (e.g., for products like window frames), would they 
</p>
<p>switch to substitutes and exit PVC-based manufacturing? (see Exhibit 5.4).
</p>
<p>Exhibit 5.3: Background on Key Customers Attending the Sustainability 
</p>
<p>Workshop
</p>
<p>The key customers attending the workshop included the following major 
</p>
<p>product areas.
</p>
<p>Building and construction
</p>
<p>The most significant group of workshop participants, in terms of volumes sold 
</p>
<p>by Hydro Polymers in the UK, was suppliers to the construction industry. 
</p>
<p>These customers purchased either PVC resin and/or PVC compounds to fab-
</p>
<p>ricate extruded profile in applications such as pipes, window frames, facia and 
</p>
<p>soffit boards.
</p>
<p>They were faced with increasing pressures to demonstrate the sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity of their products through increased regulation, especially in relation to 
</p>
<p>social housing, including new sustainability drivers being developed from the 
</p>
<p>Offices of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), requirements from bodies 
</p>
<p>such as English Partnerships, and private finance initiatives. In addition, they 
</p>
<p>experienced pressure from many of their own customers, house builders and 
</p>
<p>architects increasingly being required to demonstrate that they were using 
</p>
<p>sustainable materials in construction.
</p>
<p>Their expectations of the workshop were to learn how sustainability could be 
</p>
<p>implemented within their businesses&nbsp; &ndash; more especially whether it could help 
</p>
<p>towards the increasing requests for &ldquo;sustainable materials&rdquo;. They were also look-
</p>
<p>ing towards collaboration with their suppliers and across the industry over recov-
</p>
<p>ery of PVC for recycled applications. For most participants, the workshop was 
</p>
<p>seen as a new way of looking at their respective businesses and most were keen 
</p>
<p>to learn from the experience.
</p>
<p>These customers were heavily dependent upon PVC, which remained the 
</p>
<p>only viable plastic for use in window frames and plastic profiles. On that basis 
</p>
<p>any loss of PVC markets would be a direct loss of business to them. Alternative 
</p>
<p>products for use in window frames (timber and/or aluminium) required vastly 
</p>
<p>different processes of fabrication from the invested infrastructure in their own 
</p>
<p>companies already dedicated to processing PVC.

</p>
<p>Flooring
</p>
<p>Other participants were manufacturers supplying vinyl-based systems to a 
</p>
<p>diverse range of customers in the flooring industry. They had many of the 
</p>
<p>same issues as participants in building and construction. However, unlike con-
</p>
<p>struction, these manufacturers could offer alternatives such as linoleum and 
</p>
<p>wood laminate to their customers. Nevertheless, PVC (or vinyl as it is usually 
</p>
<p>referred to within the flooring industry) remained a hugely important material 
</p>
<p>in their portfolio, offering advantages over the alternative materials. These 
</p>
<p>participants were under increasing pressure to demonstrate the recycling 
</p>
<p>potential of their products. For them the workshop served as an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>highlight the need for supply chain engagement in order to address the recy-
</p>
<p>cling challenge jointly.

</p>
<p>Medical
</p>
<p>There were several participants from the medical industry, supplying PVC-
</p>
<p>based devices for use in a wide range of disposable but critical healthcare appli-
</p>
<p>cations, such as blood tubing and containers for blood and intravenous solutions. 
</p>
<p>Their main expectations were to gain a better insight into the sustainability 
</p>
<p>implications for PVC.&nbsp;In the main, the threats to their business came from one 
</p>
<p>of the additives used within the PVC rather than the PVC itself, i.e. the plasti-
</p>
<p>ciser known as DEHP (di 2-ethylhexyl phthalate, the softening agent to make 
</p>
<p>PVC flexible). While there have been many attempts by other material produc-
</p>
<p>ers to provide PVC alternatives based on other plastics, PVC still offered the 
</p>
<p>best overall combination of properties and was cost-competitive.
</p>

</p>
<p>Moulding products
</p>
<p>Several participants supplied the industry with mouldings for a wide range of 
</p>
<p>applications. Unlike profile manufacturers, who extrude PVC in continuous 
</p>
<p>lengths, these manufacturers processed PVC for a diverse range of applica-
</p>
<p>tions using injection moulding. They also used a range of other thermoplastic

</p>
<p>materials and were less dependent on PVC than profile producers. Like floor-
</p>
<p>ing, PVC offered some advantages for certain applications compared to alter-
</p>
<p>native thermoplastics. It cost less and, unlike other thermoplastics, did not 
</p>
<p>require the use of anti-flammables such as brominated fire retardants. These 
</p>
<p>participants saw the sustainability workshop as a mechanism to learn more 
</p>
<p>about the positive aspects of addressing sustainability. They planned to use 
</p>
<p>these in their promotional literature.

</p>
<p>Exhibit 5.4: Sustainable PVC Versus Competing Materials
</p>
<p>Hydro Polymers had recognised the need to accelerate the pace of change of 
</p>
<p>addressing sustainability within the PVC industry. One of the key drivers in 
</p>
<p>the UK had been the increasing pressure from the Building Research 
</p>
<p>Establishment (BRE) whose model, &ldquo;The Green Guide on Construction 
</p>
<p>Materials,&rdquo; was starting to appear widely. The guide, initially designed for the 
</p>
<p>Post Office to rate materials in specific applications, was based on a complex 
</p>
<p>set of environmental profiles, yet the outcome was a simple rating of either A, 
</p>
<p>B or C, where A was good and C poor from an environmental perspective. 
</p>
<p>Architects, construction companies and other specifiers turned off by the 
</p>
<p>complexities of life cycle analysis could see the benefit of using such a tool as 
</p>
<p>a simple means of materials selection.
</p>
<p>At the time of the workshop, the generic rating for PVC for use in window 
</p>
<p>profiles was C, while timber windows had an A rating. For other applications 
</p>
<p>such as flooring, PVC scored favourably and so the BRE rating was not seen 
</p>
<p>as a threat. Hydro Polymers&rsquo; window customers had highlighted that the 
</p>
<p>threat of a poor rating was directly impacting their business, and the threat 
</p>
<p>itself was likely to increase. Other influential bodies such as English 
</p>
<p>Partnerships had already decided that they would not use C-rated materials for 
</p>
<p>new build applications. PVC was losing market share as a direct result of this 
</p>
<p>rating. There was clearly a pressing need to undertake a review on improving 
</p>
<p>the rating of PVC for use in windows and this was being addressed by a joint 
</p>
<p>effort across the industry. The main options to improve the rating were identi-
</p>
<p>fied by Hydro Polymers as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Extend the life of PVC windows within the Green Guide from its current 
</p>
<p>estimated length of 25&nbsp;years (an estimate the industry was confident was 
</p>
<p>wrong)
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce the environmental footprint of PVC
</p>
<p>&bull; Introduce recycled PVC into new profiles
</p>
<p>The first option was being tackled across the UK industry via demonstra-
</p>
<p>tions to BRE that PVC windows lasted significantly longer than 25&nbsp;years, i.e., 
</p>
<p>at least 35&nbsp;years. However, the second and third options were clearly depen-
</p>
<p>dent on product sustainability initiatives and demonstrated the need to address 
</p>
<p>sustainability challenges from a real business perspective.
</p>
<p>So while the BRE assessment was clearly a threat to the industry, Hydro 
</p>
<p>Polymers also saw it as an opportunity ultimately to improve PVC&rsquo;s rating 
</p>
<p>versus competing materials such as timber. If the industry generic rating was 
</p>
<p>insufficient and PVC continued to lose ground to competing materials, there 
</p>
<p>was still the option of a specific rating for Hydro Polymers&rsquo; own PVC&nbsp;&ndash; not 
</p>
<p>its first choice but a potentially shrewd business differentiator if needs be.
</p>

<p>99
</p>
<p>Even if customers accepted that an industry-wide transition to sustainable PVC 
</p>
<p>was possible, would they support Hydro&rsquo;s strategy when other European PVC resin 
</p>
<p>producers were taking a less radical approach? Would they see a cost advantage to 
</p>
<p>the more incremental approach (despite Hydro&rsquo;s experience to the contrary)? Would 
</p>
<p>they choose to &lsquo;wait and see&rsquo; or perceive added value for their own customers and 
</p>
<p>embrace the drive for full sustainability?
</p>
<p>As Leadbitter and Rosstad pondered these questions, they knew they must give 
</p>
<p>the meeting their best shot. Getting just one or two big customers to buy into the 
</p>
<p>sustainability initiative was critical if Hydro was to embark on the next stage.
</p>
<p>At this point, Hydro&rsquo;s sustainability programme (in conjunction with TNS) was 
</p>
<p>beginning to be recognised. Employees had embraced its values and goals enthusi-
</p>
<p>astically and many felt that the programme had been beneficial. For example, it had 
</p>
<p>featured in a leading environmental journal, Environmental Data Services,8 a publi-
</p>
<p>cation traditionally hostile to PVC.&nbsp;The October 2005 edition of Hydro Polymers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>Environmental Newsletter summarised the company&rsquo;s progress on the key sustain-
</p>
<p>ability challenges as follows:
</p>
<p> 1. Carbon neutrality: &ldquo;Significant progress has been made over the last 4&nbsp;years to 
</p>
<p>reduce our CO2 emissions from our manufacturing processes. To date this has led 
</p>
<p>to over 80&nbsp;Kg of CO2 reduction per tonne of PVC produced&hellip; [achieving] our 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kyoto Protocol&rdquo; target (12% reduction) in just 4&nbsp;years&hellip; with the introduction 
</p>
<p>of our new chlorine plant at Rafnes&hellip; the predicted reduction by 2007 will be 
</p>
<p>28% lower than the CO2 emissions in 2000.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 2. Closed-loop recycling: &ldquo;Steady progress has been made on developing our 
</p>
<p>EcoVin product line. The compound is manufactured from post-industrial 
</p>
<p>scrap&hellip; to date we have had nearly 2500&nbsp;tonnes of sales that could have other-
</p>
<p>wise been destined to landfill.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 3. Elimination of persistent organic pollutants: &ldquo;The reported dioxin levels across 
</p>
<p>the whole of our operations continue to reduce&rdquo; (a graph included in the newslet-
</p>
<p>ter indicated levels had halved in 4&nbsp;years). &ldquo;Levels are anticipated to be extremely 
</p>
<p>small on the basis that the new [chlorine] plant uses new materials that have less 
</p>
<p>propensity for catalysing dioxin formation.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 4. Sustainable additives: &ldquo;Hydro Polymers&hellip; will be lead-free by the end of 2007&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(well in advance of the 2015 deadline under Vinyl 2010). &ldquo;The main stabilisers 
</p>
<p>used to replace lead will be based either on Calcium/Zinc and/or OBS based 
</p>
<p>systems.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 5. Raising awareness across the industry: &ldquo;Complementing the raw material sup-
</p>
<p>plier event in April, invitations were also extended to our customers to attend a 
</p>
<p>Marketing/Sustainability workshop during the official opening of the new 
</p>
<p> chlorine plant at Rafnes in Oslo at the end of August.&rdquo; A DVD of the key presen-
</p>
<p>tations at the supplier event was also made available to those unable to attend.

</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some dissenters remained. Also in October 2005, Green Futures, a 
</p>
<p>Forum for the Future publication, interviewed Mark Strutt of Greenpeace UK, who 
</p>
<p>had left the PVC Co-ordination Group back in 2000. His stance remained unchanged:
</p>
<p>Unless Hydro can show it can make PVC without chlorine, and without using toxic and 
</p>
<p>persistent additives, then we are not interested in small improvements. We still believe that 
</p>
<p>PVC is inherently unsustainable and completely unnecessary, as alternatives exist for virtu-
</p>
<p>ally all its applications.
</p>
<p>Hydro Polymers pressed on, all the same. At one of its FSSD workshops, it 
</p>
<p>decided to develop a distance-learning course with actors in its value chain, thereby 
</p>
<p>enabling a more cohesive approach to support each other&rsquo;s sustainability approaches. 
</p>
<p>Hydro Polymers and TNS joined forces with Blekinge Institute of Technology, 
</p>
<p>Karlskrona, Sweden. A semi-distance course was developed and delivered and in 
</p>
<p>this way the key suppliers and customers were trained in the FSSD.&nbsp;Attendees also 
</p>
<p>received 7.5 university credits. Based on the shared mental model for systematic 
</p>
<p>planning incorporated in this training, a cascading effect of actions and business 
</p>
<p>developments occurred across the supply chain, eventually leading to a 10-year sec-
</p>
<p>tor agreement. The companies agreed to embark on a joint venture to eventually 
</p>
<p>comply with the FSSD sustainability principles.
</p>
<p> The INEOS Takeover
</p>
<p>In 2006, Norsk Hydro, Hydro&rsquo;s parent company, decided to dispose of the PVC 
</p>
<p>business. Chris Welton, Hydro&rsquo;s European Head of Communications, felt that the 
</p>
<p>sustainability programme would be perceived by potential buyers of the company as 
</p>
<p>an attractive business proposition and should help to sell the business. Europe&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>largest European PVC resin producer and the UK&rsquo;s largest private company, INEOS, 
</p>
<p>expressed an interest.
</p>
<p>Culturally, INEOS was driven by business efficiency. Its main owner, Jim 
</p>
<p>Ratcliffe, had started INEOS in 1998 by purchasing an ethylene oxide chemical 
</p>
<p>plant in Antwerp, Belgium, previously owned by BP.&nbsp; Subsequently, INEOS had 
</p>
<p>acquired a number of other commodity chemical businesses from blue chip compa-
</p>
<p>nies seeking to divest these assets. Ratcliffe believed that big chemical businesses 
</p>
<p>could be inefficient and aimed to double the earnings of the businesses INEOS 
</p>
<p>acquired over 5&nbsp;years. He ran a lean operation and had a reputation for being a hard- 
</p>
<p>nosed businessman. According to the Financial Times,
</p>
<p>The formula was simple: take on a lot of debt to fund the purchase, reduce it through cost 
</p>
<p>savings and other measures, and start all over again. Once in charge, INEOS would go in 
</p>
<p>hard, stopping spending overnight. Many of the companies would have excessively high 
</p>
<p>costs and the aim was to stop waste immediately.9

</p>
<p>At the time of discussions, INEOS was heavily involved in the industry&rsquo;s Vinyl 
</p>
<p>2010 programme. Hydro was a member of Vinyl 2010 whilst also pursuing the five 
</p>
<p>key challenges from The Natural Step analysis. Both approaches were respected 
</p>
<p>because an outside party set the agenda with which the participants complied.10 
</p>
<p>Vinyl 2010 required PVC producers to pay a membership subsidy (the size of which 
</p>
<p>increased according to the volume they produced). As the largest producer in the 
</p>
<p>European PVC industry INEOS was therefore the largest financial contributor. As 
</p>
<p>such it had a political interest in Vinyl 2010 initiatives and wanted to ensure that its 
</p>
<p>hard-earned cash was invested wisely.
</p>
<p>Hydro was the only company in the PVC industry following the FSSD approach 
</p>
<p>to sustainability and was way ahead of the rest of the European PVC industry, 
</p>
<p>whereas for INEOS the Vinyl 2010 programme was working well and had the added 
</p>
<p>advantage of industry backing and support from the European Commission. The 
</p>
<p>Commission had set criteria for product stewardship and the industry was comply-
</p>
<p>ing. Indeed most of the companies involved in Vinyl 2010 were reluctant to adopt 
</p>
<p>the FSSD approach because it went so much further. Since Greenpeace and other 
</p>
<p>activists were no longer pressing the industry to reduce its carbon footprint, why 
</p>
<p>bother to invest in seemingly unnecessary reductions?11 Rather than seeing Hydro&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>efforts as complementary to the existing Vinyl 2010 voluntary commitment, it was 
</p>
<p>seen as &lsquo;going off at a tangent&rsquo; or &lsquo;in conflict&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The potential merger required two rounds of negotiations with the European 
</p>
<p>Commission, so the acquisition process lasted many months, during which there 
</p>
<p>was considerable uncertainty within Hydro. Executives wondered whether the jour-
</p>
<p>ney with TNS would be cut short. Leadbitter recalled:
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;bedding in&rsquo; process took a number of months. Whilst no one from INEOS said they 
</p>
<p>would throw out our sustainability approach, they took a cautious approach to it, preferring 
</p>
<p>to look at the best practices of each of the companies. The whole process took a lot longer 
</p>
<p>than anticipated, during which time we wondered how our jobs would be affected.
</p>
<p>In May 2007, INEOS acquired Hydro for NOK5.5&nbsp; billion, (&euro;670 million). 
</p>
<p>Leadbitter and the PVC resin business became part of INEOS ChlorVinyls, while 
</p>
<p>the PVC compound business became part of INEOS Compounds. Ex-Hydro execu-
</p>
<p>tives wondered whether they would be able to persuade INEOS of the value of the 
</p>
<p>TNS approach. Would sustainability even have a role in the new organisation?
</p>
<p>In some instances, sustainability was accommodated within areas of business 
</p>
<p>efficiency. For example, Ashley Reed, Business Director of INEOS ChlorVinyls 
</p>
<p>(and later CEO of INEOS Enterprises), though a tough operations guy, was willing 
</p>
<p>to listen if a good business case could be made. But overall INEOS felt that it was 
</p>
<p>not possible to make just one company out of a whole supply chain sustainable. For 
</p>
<p>a sustainability agenda to have an impact, it needed to be part of a broader European 
</p>
<p>cross-company programme.
</p>
<p>10 In the case of Vinyl 2010, the third party setting the agenda was the European Commission. For 
</p>
<p>Hydro Polymers it was The Natural Step.
11 Greenpeace was pursuing other agendas.

</p>
<p>Moreover, as INEOS was contributing so much to Vinyl 2010, any sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity ideas should be developed within the scope of that industry-wide initiative. At 
</p>
<p>the outset, Leadbitter didn&rsquo;t see the benefits of this approach, but he gradually 
</p>
<p>came round to the idea:
</p>
<p>Initially I felt torn. I selfishly didn&rsquo;t want to hand over our sustainability approach to the rest 
</p>
<p>of the PVC industry, as I had seen how well the approach had worked to give a competitive 
</p>
<p>advantage to our own company. However, I also realised that it was the right thing to do, and 
</p>
<p>it would give us greater exposure and more credibility with customers. The more I thought 
</p>
<p>about it, the more attractive it became. We had reached a point where it would be a natural 
</p>
<p>progression for us to broaden the programme and involve the whole of the European indus-
</p>
<p>try. I realised the benefit of capturing both approaches and demonstrating to the wider com-
</p>
<p>munity how well it had worked for Hydro.
</p>
<p>But the timing was bad. INEOS had taken on a vast amount of debt to fund its 
</p>
<p>many acquisitions and was badly hit by the 2008 financial crisis. Long-term deci-
</p>
<p>sions would have to wait&nbsp;&ndash; cost-cutting was the first priority.

</p>
<p>Introduction: Issues Management&nbsp;&ndash; Managing 
the &ldquo;Responsibilities&rdquo; of the Business
</p>
<p>Gilbert&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Lenssen 
</p>
<p>This second level of management is based on an &ldquo;outside-in&rdquo; investigation of major 
</p>
<p>trends in the immediate and wider business environment. These trends produce 
</p>
<p>issues that exacerbate risks in the business model and the business strategy, or create 
</p>
<p>new risks thereby affecting the sustainability of the business.
</p>
<p>Issues are related to the less formal, more implicit or even frontier expectations 
</p>
<p>within social contracts, that are vague when latent but can become more concrete as 
</p>
<p>they mature. These issues often serve as social symbols, channelling critique of 
</p>
<p>business and its perceived lack of responsibility or a lack of regulatory intervention 
</p>
<p>by public authorities in the face of global business dominance. Backlash over social 
</p>
<p>issues may appear disproportionate and helpless executives can be left bewildered 
</p>
<p>by accusations of a lack of corporate responsibility.
</p>
<p>Issues may be mature like corruption, inequality, poverty, privacy, obesity, off- 
</p>
<p>shoring, access to medicines, resource depletion, forest destruction, climate change. 
</p>
<p>Issues may be emerging like tax avoidance and tax competition, fugitives and 
</p>
<p>migration, emissions testing and performance of cars, programmed obsolescence of 
</p>
<p>electrical and electronic products. Issues might be linked to industry structures or 
</p>
<p>even global trade conditions. (see WTO rules playing a major part in the Chap. 8 
</p>
<p>Nike case).
</p>
<p>Adopting appropriate organisational responses to major trends in the business 
</p>
<p>environment and to the latent, emerging and maturing issues of &ldquo;corporate respon-
</p>
<p>sibility&rdquo; and developing the organisational capability for timely responsiveness is 
</p>
<p>key. As a consequence, issues management should be on the agenda of top manage-
</p>
<p>ment and boards.
</p>
<p>Ethical issues, such as corruption are particular challenges. Corruption is a 
</p>
<p>mature issue. The past 15&nbsp;years provide ample evidence of the risks of engaging in 
</p>
<p>corrupt practices. A list of the top 10 settlements (Merrill Goozner, The Fiscal 
</p>
<p>Times, December 13, 2011) reveals names (with DOJ settlements in brackets) such 
</p>
<p>as: Siemens ($1.6 billion), KBR/Halliburton ($579 million), BAE Systems ($448 
</p>
<p>million), Daimler Benz ($195 million), Alcatel Lucent ($137 million), and even 
</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson ($70 million)</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>With the anti-corruption stance of the Chinese government since 2013, compa-
</p>
<p>nies take on significant risk in the Chinese market by not following strict anti- 
</p>
<p>corruption policies. Recent examples include GSK and Roche in 2014. The US 
</p>
<p>courts maintain vigilance in fighting corruption in America (e.g., United Continental 
</p>
<p>in 2015) as well as abroad on the basis of the FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). 
</p>
<p>A recent example is HP, which settled out of court for alleged corruption in Poland, 
</p>
<p>Mexico and Russia in 2014.
</p>
<p>Key Questions to Ask (Applicable to All Part II Cases)
</p>
<p>What are the current major trends in the business environment?
</p>
<p>Which major issues&nbsp; &ndash; latent, emerging or maturing&nbsp; &ndash; are affecting the business 
</p>
<p>model and exacerbating the business model risks?
</p>
<p>How is the company managing these issues: is it defensive, compliance, managerial, 
</p>
<p>strategic in approach?
</p>
<p>How will the business model be affected in the long term by major macro trends like 
</p>
<p>climate change, resource depletion, demographic change, geo-political change, 
</p>
<p>and the way these interact and reinforce each other?
</p>
<p>How should the company protect and enhance value in the face of these issues and 
</p>
<p>trends?
</p>
<p>How is organisational capability and leadership developed to respond in a timely 
</p>
<p>and appropriate way?
</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Expect the Unexpected by KPMG
</p>
<p>Ten sustainability mega-forces will impact business over the next 20&nbsp;years, requir-
</p>
<p>ing strategic stances by businesses to cope in a timely and effective way. These 
</p>
<p>megaforces are systemically linked: climate change, volatile energy markets, mate-
</p>
<p>rial resource scarcity, water scarcity, demographic growth, the emerging global 
</p>
<p>middle class, urbanisation, food security, declining ecosystems, deforestation. 
</p>
<p>Trend projections prepared without consideration of the entire system of mega-
</p>
<p>forces are increasingly inadequate. The authors identify three nexuses which repre-
</p>
<p>sent the challenges of sustainable growth which companies need to address: the 
</p>
<p>footprint nexus, the erosion nexus, the innovation nexus. A sector analysis of exter-
</p>
<p>nal impacts and pressures to internalise costs for these is provided for the following 
</p>
<p>sectors: airlines, automobile, beverages, chemicals, electricity, food, industrial met-
</p>
<p>als, marine transportation, mining, oil and gas, ITC.
</p>
<p>Chapter 7: The Path to Corporate Responsibility by Simon Zadek
</p>
<p>The key issue in this case is child labour. Child labour was rampant in Europe and 
</p>
<p>the US until the early twentieth century, merely 100&nbsp;years ago. It still persisted in 
</p>
<p>small family businesses in France, Germany the UK and Italy till WWII.&nbsp; It was 
</p>
<p>estimated by the ILO in 1999 that child labour still accounts for 1% of the work-
</p>
<p>force in Europe, the US and Canada. But in Africa it accounts for 32%, in Asia 22%, 
</p>
<p>and in Latin America 17%. Nike&rsquo;s suppliers used child labour which is an endemic 
</p>
<p>practice in many Asian societies. &ldquo;Do not use child labour&rdquo; is a simple policy

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>105
</p>
<p>statement which may be backed up by an ethical code for managers, but it is hard to 
</p>
<p>implement the policy. At Nike, installing a CSR department to implement compli-
</p>
<p>ance policies was wholly ineffective. Nike went through 4 stages of organisational 
</p>
<p>learning over many years to come to a more or less positive outcome. It lost consid-
</p>
<p>erable brand value and incurred considerable costs before it realised it had to change 
</p>
<p>its business model and rally the industry sector around a campaign to change an 
</p>
<p>international trade agreement. To its critics, Nike&rsquo;s business model amounted to a 
</p>
<p>license to print money: the lowest possible cost in the supply chain, no capital 
</p>
<p>employed in production, nor in working capital thanks to just-in-time supplies, high 
</p>
<p>margins in sales and marketing with exclusively branded products. But the party did 
</p>
<p>not last forever. Impressively high profitability and returns mostly always hide high 
</p>
<p>risks in the business model which can be exacerbated by emerging issues and pose 
</p>
<p>serious threats to business sustainability .
</p>
<p>Chapter 8: GSK: Profits, Patents and Patients by N.&nbsp;Craig Smith and Dawn 
</p>
<p>Jarisch
</p>
<p>The key issue in this case is access to medicines. Access to medicines as a universal 
</p>
<p>human right is now a mature issue. Providing medicines to poorer countries at 
</p>
<p>affordable prices may make economic sense because it enhances economies of scale 
</p>
<p>in production and extends global brand reach. But it can undermine the very busi-
</p>
<p>ness model of a pharmaceutical business which requires high margins to remunerate 
</p>
<p>extremely high investment levels in research and development before the patents 
</p>
<p>run out and the medicine becomes &ldquo;generic&rdquo;. High prices in developed markets can 
</p>
<p>be obtained, but practice showed how parallel trade from low margin developed 
</p>
<p>countries into the high margin Western countries undermined the integrity of the 
</p>
<p>business model. GSK needed to ensure that medicines which it provided in South 
</p>
<p>Africa at affordable prices would arrive in the clinics with the patients and not dis-
</p>
<p>appear into parallel trade to Europe. Partnerships with NGO&rsquo;s to extend its distribu-
</p>
<p>tion chain to patients appeared to be the answer. The case also poses the question 
</p>
<p>how far a company needs to go to solve social issues. How to deal with the ever 
</p>
<p>extending demands of &ldquo;corporate responsibility&rdquo; is central to Issues Management.
</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Revenue Flow and Human Rights: The Paradoxes of Shell in 
</p>
<p>Nigeria by Aileen M. Ionescu-Somers
</p>
<p>Human rights is a key issue in this case, along with environmental harm, govern-
</p>
<p>ment corruption and poverty. Oil companies often require 30-year payback periods 
</p>
<p>to fund the huge investments required in exploration and production. It is therefore 
</p>
<p>surprising that these companies do not take more account of the social, environmen-
</p>
<p>tal and political issues likely to emerge over such a long timeframe. Is it the &ldquo;can 
</p>
<p>do&rdquo; engineering mindset? Ignorance of context issues while rolling out a business 
</p>
<p>model which was elsewhere successful? Complacency by refraining from getting 
</p>
<p>embroiled in thorny issues like civil wars? Lack of courage to stand up to corrupt 
</p>
<p>host governments? In Nigeria, Shell got almost everything wrong by ignoring the 
</p>
<p>social, environmental and political impacts of its business. In 2013, CEO Peter 
</p>
<p>Voser admitted that trouble in Nigeria continued to depress financial performance

</p>
<p>and announced that Shell would pull out from the Niger Delta oil production. Shell 
</p>
<p>did learn from this experience in three ways. First, it implemented a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>risk assessment model, charting all the potential costs required to mitigate these 
</p>
<p>risks, including social, environmental and political risks BEFORE a major invest-
</p>
<p>ment decision would be taken. As a result, some highly promising projects from a 
</p>
<p>technical and (at first glance) financial perspective were abandoned. Second, envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental and social impacts of running projects are continuously monitored and 
</p>
<p>are redressed by targeted programmes (also see chap. 15). Third, Shell became the 
</p>
<p>founding partner in EITI, Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an industry 
</p>
<p>wide initiative to curb corruption by governments.
</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Ziqitza Health Care Limited: Responding to Corruption by 
</p>
<p>N.&nbsp;Craig Smith and Robert J.&nbsp;Crawford
</p>
<p>The key issue here is clearly bribery and corruption. Are bribes to be considered as 
</p>
<p>a cost of doing business in emerging and developing countries, or is the social cost 
</p>
<p>of corruption so disruptive that it stands in the way of economic and social develop-
</p>
<p>ment and therefore in conflict with the medium term interests of businesses? The 
</p>
<p>case illustrates the challenges of a social enterprise business in an emerging country 
</p>
<p>like India, where Ziqitza took a decisive stance to make anti-corruption part of its 
</p>
<p>brand, its value proposition and its legal policy.
</p>
<p>The company found itself in a difficult balancing act with on the one hand a busi-
</p>
<p>ness brand and mission to fight corruption and on the other hand a public sector 
</p>
<p>where corruption is rampant. Corruption is an ethical issue with destructive social 
</p>
<p>impacts and which is very much mature but many businesses fail to abstain from the 
</p>
<p>practice and can suffer heavy financial and reputation losses as a result.

<p>6Expect the Unexpected: Building Business Value in a Changing World
KPMG International
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>For 20&nbsp;years or more the world has recognized that the way we do business has seri-
</p>
<p>ous impacts on the world around us. Now it is increasingly clear that the state of the 
</p>
<p>world around us affects the way we do business.
</p>
<p>The resources on which business relies are becoming more difficult to access and 
</p>
<p>more costly. Increasing strain on infrastructure and natural systems is likely as pat-
</p>
<p>terns of economic growth and wealth change. Physical assets and supply chains will 
</p>
<p>be affected by the unpredictable results of a changing climate. And businesses can 
</p>
<p>expect an ever more complex web of sustainability legislation and fiscal 
</p>
<p>instruments.
</p>
<p>But this is not the whole story. The central challenge of our age&nbsp;&ndash; decoupling 
</p>
<p>human progress from resource use and environmental decline&nbsp;&ndash; can also be one of 
</p>
<p>the biggest sources of future success for business. More corporations are recogniz-
</p>
<p>ing that there is value and opportunity in a broader sense of responsibility beyond 
</p>
<p>the next quarter&rsquo;s results; that what is good for people and the planet can also be 
</p>
<p>good for the long term bottom line and shareholder value.
</p>
<p>In this report, KPMG&rsquo;s network of firms analyzes a system of ten sustainability 
</p>
<p>megaforces that will impact each and every business over the next 20&nbsp;years. These 
</p>
<p>forces do not act alone in predictable ways. They are interconnected. They 
</p>
<p>interact.
</p>
<p>It is important for business leaders to understand this system of forces; assess the 
</p>
<p>implications for their own organizations; and devise strategies for managing the

<p>risks and harnessing the opportunities. We can never know the future. But it is good 
</p>
<p>business sense to be prepared for the possibilities: to expect the unexpected.
</p>
<p>This report cannot provide all the answers, and does not set out to, but it does 
</p>
<p>suggest approaches that we at KPMG believe will help to build business value in a 
</p>
<p>changing world.
</p>
<p> Global Sustainability Megaforces Will Affect the Future 
of Every Business
</p>
<p>For this report dozens of forecasts have been analyzed to identify the changes that will have 
the greatest effects on business
</p>
<p>Over the next 20&nbsp;years businesses will be exposed to hundreds of environmental 
</p>
<p>and social changes that will bring both risks and opportunities in the search for 
</p>
<p>sustainable growth.
</p>
<p>For this report dozens of forecasts have been analyzed to identify the changes 
</p>
<p>that will have the greatest effects on business.
</p>
<p>The result is a set of ten global sustainability megaforces that we believe will 
impact every business over the next two decades. They are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Climate Change: the one global megaforce that directly impacts all others dis-
cussed in this report. Predictions of annual output losses from climate change 
</p>
<p>range between 1% per year, if strong and early action is taken, to at least 5% a 
</p>
<p>year if policymakers fail to act.
</p>
<p>&bull; Energy &amp; Fuel: fossil fuel markets are likely to become more volatile and

<p>ical pattern of consumption; supply and production uncertainties; and increasing 
</p>
<p>regulatory interventions related to climate change.
</p>
<p>&bull; Material Resource Scarcity: as developing countries industrialize rapidly, 
global demand for material resources is predicted to increase dramatically. 
</p>
<p>Business is likely to face increasing trade restrictions and intense global compe-
</p>
<p>tition for a wide range of material resources that become less easily available. 
</p>
<p>Scarcity also creates opportunities to develop substitute materials or to recover 
</p>
<p>materials from waste.
</p>
<p>&bull; Water Scarcity: it is predicted that by 2030, the global demand for freshwater 
will exceed supply by 40 per cent.1 Businesses may be vulnerable to water short-
</p>
<p>ages, declines in water quality, water price volatility, and to reputational chal-
</p>
<p>lenges. Growth could be compromised and conflicts over water supplies may 
</p>
<p>create a security risk to business operations.
</p>
<p>&bull; Population Growth: global population is predicted to be 8.4&nbsp;billion by 2032&nbsp;in 
a moderate growth scenario.2 This growth will place intense pressures on ecosys-
</p>
<p>tems and the supply of natural resources such as food, water, energy and materi-
</p>
<p>als.3 Businesses can expect supply challenges and price volatility as a result. This 
</p>
<p>is a threat, but there are also opportunities to grow commerce, create jobs, and to 
</p>
<p>innovate to address the needs of growing populations.
</p>
<p>&bull; Wealth: the global middle class (defined by the OECD as individuals with dis-
posable income of between US$10 and US$100 per capita per day)4 is predicted 
</p>
<p>to grow 172% between 2010 and 2030.5 The challenge for businesses is to serve 
</p>
<p>this new middle class market at a time when resources are likely to be scarcer and 
</p>
<p>more price-volatile. The advantages many companies experienced in the last two 
</p>
<p>decades from &ldquo;cheap labor&rdquo; in developing nations are likely to be eroded by the 
</p>
<p>growth and power of the global middle class.
</p>
<p>&bull; Urbanization: in 2009, for the first time ever, more people lived in cities than in 
the countryside.6 By 2030 all developing regions including Asia and Africa are 
</p>
<p>expected to have the majority of their inhabitants living in urban areas7; virtually

</p>
<p>all Population Growth over the next 30&nbsp;years will be in cities. These cities will 
</p>
<p>require extensive improvements in infrastructure including construction, water 
</p>
<p>and sanitation, electricity, waste, transport, health, public safety and internet and 
</p>
<p>cell phone connectivity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Food Security: in the next two decades the global food production system will 
come under increasing pressure from megaforces including Population Growth, 
</p>
<p>Water Scarcity and Deforestation. Global food prices are predicted to rise 
</p>
<p>70&ndash;90% by 2030.8 In water-scarce regions, agricultural producers are likely to 
</p>
<p>have to compete for supplies with other water-intensive industries such as elec-
</p>
<p>tric utilities and mining, and with consumers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ecosystem Decline: historically, the main business risk of declining biodiversity 
and ecosystem services has been to corporate reputations. However, as global 
</p>
<p>ecosystems show increasing signs of breakdown and stress, more companies are 
</p>
<p>realizing how dependent their operations are on the critical services these eco-
</p>
<p>systems provide. The decline in ecosystems is making natural resources scarcer, 
</p>
<p>more expensive and less diverse; increasing the costs of water and escalating the 
</p>
<p>damage caused by invasive species to sectors including agriculture, fishing, food 
</p>
<p>and beverages, pharmaceuticals and tourism.
</p>
<p>&bull; Deforestation: Forests are big business. Wood products contributed $100&nbsp;bil-
lion per year to the global economy from 2003 to 2007 and the value of non-
</p>
<p>wood forest products (mostly food) was estimated at US$18.5&nbsp;billion in 2005.
</p>
<p>Yet forest areas are predicted to decline by 13% from 2005 to 2030, mostly in 
</p>
<p>South Asia and Africa.9 The timber industry and downstream sectors such  
</p>
<p>as pulp and paper are vulnerable to potential regulation to slow or reverse 
</p>
<p>deforestation. Companies may also find themselves under increasing pressure 
</p>
<p>from customers to prove that their products are sustainable. Opportunities may 
</p>
<p>arise through market mechanisms and incentives to reduce the rate of 
</p>
<p>deforestation.
</p>
<p>These cities will require extensive improvements in infrastructure including construction, 
water and sanitation, electricity, waste, transport, health, public safety and internet and cell 
phone connectivity.

</p>
<p> The Systems Approach to Sustainability: Planning for Change
</p>
<p>Existing projections provide some insights about a possible future, but should not 
</p>
<p>be relied upon to provide the whole story. Many predictions extrapolate current 
</p>
<p>rates of change without taking full account of the fact that sustainability megaforces 
</p>
<p>reinforce, compete with, or balance the effects of others.
</p>
<p>For example, increasing wealth and the growth of the global middle class will 
</p>
<p>accelerate demand for consumer goods and services, putting further pressure on the 
</p>
<p>natural and material resources needed to produce them. Regional freshwater avail-
</p>
<p>ability could struggle to keep pace with the agricultural production necessary to 
</p>
<p>feed the growing population. Urbanization predictions generally do not account for 
</p>
<p>the potential impacts of climate change refugees migrating from areas where water 
</p>
<p>and food scarcity hit hardest. Food production projections rarely factor in deterio-
</p>
<p>rating soil quality and the competing demands for agricultural land.
</p>
<p>Trend projections prepared without consideration of the entire system of sustain-
</p>
<p>ability megaforces no longer provide an adequate basis for strategic business 
</p>
<p>decisions.
</p>
<p>Systems thinking around sustainability embraces the entire structure of mega-
</p>
<p>forces rather than its individual constituents. It is an important way to assess and 
</p>
<p>manage new risks and uncover risks that were previously unidentified. For example, 
</p>
<p>a company may understand its direct dependency on water, but may not have thought 
</p>
<p>about how the supply of its material resources could be impacted by increasing 
</p>
<p>water scarcity.
</p>
<p>Companies may already be using systems thinking, for example in strategic 
</p>
<p>planning, revenue management or supply chain planning but in KPMG&rsquo;s view it 
</p>
<p>should be applied as part of a proactive sustainability strategy.

</p>
<p>Trend projections prepared without consideration of the entire system of megaforces no 
longer provide an adequate basis for strategic business decisions.
</p>
<p> The Nexus Approach
</p>
<p>The nexus approach has been widely used by the World Economic Forum and oth-
</p>
<p>ers to explore the driving forces behind the challenge of water security.
</p>
<p>For the purposes of this report we have developed three nexuses which together 
</p>
<p>represent the challenges of sustainable growth. KPMG believes companies will 
</p>
<p>benefit from exploring these nexuses in their own organizational context.
</p>
<p> The Footprint Nexus
</p>
<p>The forces behind mankind&rsquo;s escalating &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; on the planet are interlinked 
</p>
<p>through a complex network of relationships. The Footprint Nexus is a useful plan-
</p>
<p>ning tool to help business leaders envision the future world and market conditions 
</p>
<p>they will be operating in and to develop appropriate strategies (Fig.&nbsp;6.1).
</p>
<p>For the purposes of this report we have developed three nexuses which together represent 
the challenges of sustainable growth.
</p>
<p> The Erosion Nexus
</p>
<p>The Erosion Nexus helps executives to explore in greater detail the many challenges 
</p>
<p>and opportunities their businesses could face as a result of the interactions between 
</p>
<p>sustainability megaforces. By considering the full system of megaforces, executives 
</p>
<p>are more likely to avoid sustainability &ldquo;quick fixes&rdquo; that can result in unforeseen 
</p>
<p>problems and greater risks later on (Fig.&nbsp;6.2).
</p>
<p> The Innovation Nexus
</p>
<p>The Innovation Nexus is an example of how executives can use the systems approach 
</p>
<p>to develop business opportunities by innovating solutions to sustainability prob-
</p>
<p>lems. This example suggests that sustainable lifestyles, ecological restoration, 
</p>
<p>renewable energy, resource productivity, and the use of ICT to create &ldquo;smart&rdquo; cities, 
</p>
<p>are among the key innovations required to avoid dangerous levels of climate change 
</p>
<p>(Fig.&nbsp;6.3).

<p> Global Sustainability Megaforces: A Sectoral View
</p>
<p>It is prudent for companies to expect to pay in the future a rising proportion of their external 
environmental costs.
</p>
<p>Over the next 20&nbsp;years there is likely to be increasing pressure for the price of 
</p>
<p>resources, products and services to reflect the full cost of their production including 
</p>
<p>the cost of environmental impacts. Such pressure is likely to grow as governments 
</p>
<p>address the effects of sustainability megaforces.
</p>
<p>Possible futures include the removal of subsidies on input commodities (such as 
</p>
<p>fossil fuels and water) and the wider introduction of mechanisms to increase the 
</p>
<p>cost of environmentally damaging outputs.
</p>
<p>It is therefore prudent for companies to expect to pay in the future a rising pro-
</p>
<p>portion of their external environmental costs which today are often not shown on 
</p>
<p>financial statements.
</p>
<p> Costs of Environmental Impacts Are Doubling Every 14 years
</p>
<p>&bull; Data provided by Trucostand analyzed for this report suggests that the external 
</p>
<p>environmental costs of 11 key industry sectors (including upstream supply chain) 
</p>
<p>rose by 50% between 2002 and 2010, from US$566&nbsp;billion to US$854&nbsp;billion.10
</p>
<p>10 For the purposes of this report, Trucost, an independent environmental research agency, has 
provided a data set based on the operations of over 800 companies between 2002 and 2010 (2010 
being the most recent available data) and representing 11 sectors. In this analysis Trucost converts 
22 environmental impactsinto financial value, drawing upon current environmental-economic 
research. They include greenhouse gases, water abstraction and waste generation. Together these 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>117
</p>
<p>&bull; The sectors analyzed were: Airlines; Automobiles; Beverages; Chemicals; 
</p>
<p>Electricity; Food Producers; Industrial Metals &amp; Mining; Mining; Marine 
</p>
<p>Transportation; Oil &amp; Gas; Telecommunications &amp; Internet (defined in line with 
</p>
<p>the Industry Classification Benchmark system).11
</p>
<p>&bull; The data suggests that the external environmental costs of business operations 
</p>
<p>are doubling every 14&nbsp;years: a rate that is unlikely to be sustainable even in the 
</p>
<p>medium-term.
</p>
<p> Value at Stake: Sectors Could See Profits Lost
</p>
<p>&bull; External environmental costs could account for a considerable proportion of 
</p>
<p>earnings (EBITDA) and thus represent significant business value potentially at 
</p>
<p>stake: across the 11 sectors, the average external environmental costs per dollar 
</p>
<p>of earnings would have been approximately 41 cents in 2010 (Fig.&nbsp;6.4).
</p>
<p>&bull; According to the data, Food Producers had the largest external environmental 
</p>
<p>cost footprint of the 11 sectors in 2010 at US$200&nbsp;billion, followed by Electricity 
</p>
<p>at US$195&nbsp;billion and Oil &amp; Gas at US$152&nbsp;billion.
</p>
<p>&bull; External environmental costs of the Food Producers could outweigh the sector&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>entire earnings. For five other sectors (Electricity, Industrial Metals, Mining, 
</p>
<p>MarineTransportation and Airlines) environmental costs could account for more 
</p>
<p>than half of earnings.
</p>
<p> Exposure Reduced But Driven Mostly by Rise in Earnings
</p>
<p>&bull; For most sectors covered in this report, earnings rose far more steeply than exter-
</p>
<p>nal environmental costs over the period 2002&ndash;2010, thereby reducing the propor-
</p>
<p>tion of EBITDA at risk (average external environmental costs across the 11 
</p>
<p>sectors would have accounted for 91 cents for every US dollar of earnings in 
</p>
<p>2002 vs 41 cents in 2010) (Fig.&nbsp;6.5).
</p>
<p>22 indicators represent the bulk of the environmental footprint for most companies. The physical 
totals of these inputs and outputs are converted into financial values and aggregated to achieve a 
total environmental cost value. These costs, which for the most part do not appear on corporate 
financial statements, are known as external environmental costs.
</p>
<p>EBITDA data come from independent financial data providers and are checked by Trucost 
analysts against company financial statements.
</p>
<p>The conversion of environmental impacts into dollar sums of external environmental cost is a 
relatively new practice but one that is gaining momentum. The data is not yet 100 percent exact and 
for this reason the analyses should be taken as indicative rather than absolute.

<p>&bull; The only sector of the 11 to demonstrate an absolute reduction in its external 
</p>
<p>environmental costs over the 8-year period was Automobiles, which achieved a 
</p>
<p>drop of 14% against an earnings increase of 22% over the period.
</p>
<p>&bull; Chemicals recorded a minimal rise in environmental costs of 2.5%. Electricity 
</p>
<p>was the third lowest in terms of growth in environmental costs over the period, 
</p>
<p>with an increase of 16%.
</p>
<p> Environmental Intensity: A Clearer Picture
</p>
<p>&bull; Relative performance of sectors was explored by calculating how their environ-
mental intensity (external environmental costs per US dollar of earnings) has 
changed between 2002 and 2010.
</p>
<p>&bull; Industrial Metals has achieved the greatest improvement of the 11 sectors in 
</p>
<p>terms of its environmental intensity, however the sector&rsquo;s significant growth in 
</p>
<p>earnings over the period helped it to gain this position (Fig.&nbsp;6.6).
</p>
<p>Mining has achieved a similar improvement in its environmental intensity but has also 
recorded the largest increase of all 11 sectors in its external environmental costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Mining has achieved a similar improvement in its environmental intensity but 
</p>
<p>has also recorded the largest increase of all 11 sectors in its external environmen-
</p>
<p>tal costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; A cluster of sectors&nbsp;&ndash; Automobiles, Chemicals and Electricity&nbsp;&ndash; have improved 
</p>
<p>their environmental intensity while also achieving negative or low growth in the 
</p>
<p>external environmental costs they incur. This suggests that these three sectors are 
</p>
<p>coming the closest to decoupling their economic growth from environmental 
</p>
<p>impact.
</p>
<p>&bull; Food Producers and Beverages have shown the lowest rates of environmental 
</p>
<p>intensity improvement. Food Producers is the only one of the 11 sectors that, 
</p>
<p>according to the data, has not improved its environmental intensity at all over the 
</p>
<p>last 8&nbsp;years.
</p>
<p> Perceptions of Sectoral Risks and Readiness to Deal with Them
</p>
<p>&bull; KPMG has analyzed more than 60 sector reports and aggregated their findings

</p>
<p>nesses to deal with those risks.12 Given the methodology used, the risk exposure 
</p>
<p>and readiness levels presented here are perceived, rather than actual and so find-
</p>
<p>ings should be taken as indicative not absolute.
</p>
<p>&bull; The two sectors perceived as being at highest risk from sustainability mega-
</p>
<p>forces, but least ready are Food Producers and Beverages. This supports the find-
</p>
<p>ings of the environmental intensity analysis which shows they have made the 
</p>
<p>least progress in reducing their environmental intensity while their exposure to 
</p>
<p>environmental cost is growing rapidly.
</p>
<p>&bull; The Automobiles and Telecommunications &amp; Internet sectors are perceived as 
</p>
<p>being the least at risk and the most ready.
</p>
<p>&bull; The cluster of sectors in the center of the risk-readiness matrix indicates that 
</p>
<p>perceived sustainability risk remains high for Oil &amp; Gas, Electricity, Mining &amp; 
</p>
<p>Metals and Airlines. Electricity is seen as the most ready among these (Fig.&nbsp;6.7).
</p>
<p>12 The risk types assessed were: Physical; Competitive; Regulatory; Reputational; Litigation; and 
Social.
</p>
<p>Physical Risks include the risk of damage to physical assets and supply chains from climate 
change-related weather events and exposure to long-term environmental trends, such as variations 
in water availability or rising sea levels. Competitive Risks include the risk of exposure to cost 
increases or cost volatility of key input commodities such as energy, fuel, water and agricultural 
products as well as exposure to shifts in market dynamics. Regulatory Risks include the risk of 
increased costs and complexity for business from policies and regulations designed to limit the 
long-term effects of sustainability megaforces. Examples include carbon taxes, emissions trading 
systems and fuel tariffs. Reputational Risks include the risk of damage to corporate reputation 
and brand value among stakeholders when a company is perceived as failing to act appropriately 
in response to sustainability challenges. Litigation Risks include the risk of litigation over envi-
ronmental damage or insufficient corporate disclosure on sustainability. Social Risks include the 
risk of serious disruption to business operations and supply chains due to the societal effects of 
sustainability megaforces. Examples include mass migration as &ldquo;climate refugees&rdquo; try to escape 
the worst impacts of climate change; conflicts over scarce resources such as water; and civil unrest 
driven by population growth and wealth inequality. The level of sector readiness was also assessed 
using data gathered for the KPMG International Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting 
2011.

<p> Call to Action: Business Strategies &amp; Policy Formation
</p>
<p>Without action and planning for the complex future that lies ahead, risks will multiply and 
opportunities will be lost.
</p>
<p>With potentially far reaching impacts on the horizon as a result of global sustain-
</p>
<p>ability megaforces, businesses and policymakers together must take strategic deci-
</p>
<p>sions now and promote changes in long term thinking. Without action and planning 
</p>
<p>for the complex future that lies ahead, risks will multiply and opportunities will be 
</p>
<p>lost.
</p>
<p>Sustainable growth requires action from both economic sides: supply and 
</p>
<p>demand. The supply side must make more with less, increasing resource efficiency 
</p>
<p>and minimizing the environmental footprint of processes and operations. The 
</p>
<p>demand side must make less do more, managing growing demand for goods and 
</p>
<p>services, while addressing pressure on dwindling natural resources.
</p>
<p> Recommendations: The Essentials of Business Action
</p>
<p>Global sustainability megaforces will mean constraints, complexity and risks for 
</p>
<p>business. But business leaders can do much more than simply survive the risks. 
</p>
<p>With foresight and planning they can turn risks into new opportunities and pioneer 
</p>
<p>actions to prepare for an uncertain future:
</p>
<p>&bull; Understand and assess risks. Businesses are advised to use Enterprise Risk 
Management tools and sustainability systems thinking to (a) assess and under-
</p>
<p>KPMG International</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>125
</p>
<p>stand future risks from sustainability megaforces and (b) define responses to deal 
</p>
<p>with them through efficiency, substitution or adaptation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use integrated strategic planning and strategy development. Strategic plan-
ning for sustainability requires the involvement of the business management and 
</p>
<p>should encompass a wide range of corporate functions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Turn strategic plans into ambitious targets and actions for energy and 
resource efficiency, sustainable supply chain management, innovation and access 
</p>
<p>to new markets for greener products and services.
</p>
<p>Explore tax incentives tailored to alternative energy, energy efficiency and other 
</p>
<p>areas related to sustainability.13
</p>
<p>&bull; Measure and report on sustainability. Sustainability reporting, although 
largely still unregulated, will become increasingly important in the future. 
</p>
<p>Integrated reporting, where sustainability information is included in the full pic-
</p>
<p>ture of the company&rsquo;s business performance, is a growing trend. For integrated 
</p>
<p>reporting companies need to build a framework for sustainability reporting pro-
</p>
<p>cesses, stronger information systems and appropriate governance and control 
</p>
<p>mechanisms on a par with those currently used in financial reporting.
</p>
<p>&bull; Seek collaboration with business partners on sustainability issues. This will 
be critical to increase leverage and improve the cost-benefit ratio of action.
</p>
<p>&bull; Build strategic partnerships: seek opportunities for genuine dialogue with the 
governments and demonstrate new and innovative approaches to Public-Private 
</p>
<p>Partnerships. Improved dialogue could focus on economic instruments and mar-
</p>
<p>ket barriers that could be reduced to make sustainable business operation easier 
</p>
<p>(Fig.&nbsp;6.8).
</p>
<p> Recommendations: The Essentials of Government Action 
towards Sustainability
</p>
<p>Policymakers are urged to deliver the overarching policy goals that will be crucial for busi-
ness to make a timely transition towards a sustainable society.
</p>
<p>The global sustainability megaforces of the coming decades will bring shocks 
</p>
<p>and surprises. As governments in all regions will be called upon to take more steps 
</p>
<p>to limit or reverse negative environmental and social impacts, businesses will be 
</p>
<p>confronted with an ever more complex web of sustainability-related fiscal instru-
</p>
<p>ments and legislation. Policymakers are urged to deliver the overarching policy 
</p>
<p>goals that will be crucial for business to make a timely transition towards a sustain-
</p>
<p>able society.

</p>
<p>&bull; Continuity and coherence in policy: Clear, well planned and secure govern-
ment policies are crucial for scaling-up investment and facilitating the transition 
</p>
<p>to green economy. Strong collaboration across governmental bodies and minis-
</p>
<p>tries on sustainability issues will be key.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reducing complexity in policy: Reducing regulatory complexity and improv-
ing transparency is another key area for action, as businesses frequently cite 
</p>
<p>regulatory complexity as one of the main sources of risk and uncertainty sur-
</p>
<p>rounding sustainability.
</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinated international collaboration: Multilateral coordination across

<p>tions in all areas: national-level regulations, policies, subsidies, incentives and 
</p>
<p>legal frameworks, as well as international market, legal infrastructure, trade pro-
</p>
<p>tocols and development aid measures. In creating an enabling environment, gov-
</p>
<p>ernments must seek to use a variety of policy tools&nbsp;&ndash; including taxation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Increased collaboration with private sector through Public Private 
Partnerships (PPPs): If properly designed, PPPs can provide an effective archi-
tecture for promoting sustainability in a way that mobilizes private sector finance, 
</p>
<p>rather than relying on public funding alone.
</p>
<p> Business and Government Working Together: Public- Private 
Partnerships as a Tool for Green Growth
</p>
<p>To achieve their strategies, governments need corporations to provide low-carbon 
</p>
<p>and green technology, the skills to deploy and operate it, and the funds of financiers 
</p>
<p>to invest in delivering it. Given that many national budgets remain stretched as a 
</p>
<p>result of the global financial crisis, the conditions seem ripe for the wider introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of PPP structures using private finance.14
</p>
<p>KPMG has engaged in many PPPs over the past 15&nbsp;years. Based on this experi-
</p>
<p>ence, the key points for developing successful PPPs are15:
</p>
<p>&bull; The PPP process cannot be rushed&nbsp;&ndash; it takes time to develop properly;
</p>
<p>&bull; PPPs sometimes require significant upfront costs, but meeting these costs will 
</p>
<p>make it much more attractive, particularly if investors can see that the right 
</p>
<p>resources have been applied;
</p>
<p>&bull; Governments must play an active role in monitoring and regulating the project;
</p>
<p>&bull; PPP structures must be designed to include clear and formal methodologies for 
</p>
<p>reviewing contracts over the term of the project (particularly those that last 
</p>
<p>10&ndash;30&nbsp;years or more);
</p>
<p>&bull; A single-minded focus is essential for developing transparent and competitive 
</p>
<p>procurement procedures.
</p>
<p> Imperatives for Achieving Sustainable Growth
</p>
<p>The transition to a sustainable economy is possible, but it requires widespread 
</p>
<p>global support from businesses, governments and civil society. This transition 
</p>
<p>requires solutions that address both how and which goods and services are 
</p>
<p>produced. Both the public and private sectors have a vital role to play and a coordi-
</p>
<p>nated approach holds the key to success (Fig.&nbsp;6.9).

<p>7Pathways to Corporate Responsibility -  Revisited
Simon&nbsp;Zadek
</p>
<p> 2020 Vision&nbsp;&ndash; In&nbsp;Retrospect
</p>
<p>The death of 1129 workers resulting from the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment 
</p>
<p>factory in Bangladesh on 24th April 2013 may well mark the end of an era of cor-
</p>
<p>porate responsibility, and perhaps the onset of a next generation of activities involv-
</p>
<p>ing different and improved instruments and activities.
</p>
<p>Almost two decades of intensive engagement with the apparel and textiles sector 
</p>
<p>in efforts to improve labor standards have delivered a multitude of principles, com-
</p>
<p>mitments, codes, auditing and disclosure mechanisms, as well as a veritable indus-
</p>
<p>try of business-led, civil society and multi-stakeholder initiatives (Zadek 2000). 
</p>
<p>Such investments, in the main, were made in good faith by all parties seeking to 
</p>
<p>improve worker conditions. Broadly they fell within the envelope of the prevailing 
</p>
<p>features of global value chains that leverage international cost differentials to ben-
</p>
<p>efit consumers and the globally integrated enterprise. There is no doubt that the 
</p>
<p>approach delivered some tangible benefits to all. Capitalism was not tamed, but 
</p>
<p>these tangible benefits brought with them a sense of optimism that companies and 
</p>
<p>markets could be encouraged without the need to engage the state as regulator to 
</p>
<p>internalize and so mitigate at least some, hopefully the most serious, negative social 
</p>
<p>and environmental externalities.
</p>
<p>Such so-called &ldquo;civil regulatory&rdquo; (Zadek and Forstater 1999) approaches blos-
</p>
<p>somed throughout the end of the 1990s and the noughties, and spread like wildfire 
</p>
<p>from the test-bed of apparel and textiles to virtually every visible sector, from codes 
</p>
<p>governing big pharma&rsquo;s clinical trials to the extraction and sale of gold and dia-
</p>
<p>monds to the rise of sustainability-focused certification for everything from palm oil </p>

<p>to salmon and soya (Grayson and Nelson 2013). Although each with their unique 
</p>
<p>aspects, the underlying &lsquo;pathways to corporate responsibility&rsquo; looked remarkably 
</p>
<p>similar:
</p>
<p> 1. Brand leaders were publicly accused of profiting from poor ethical practice, or at 
</p>
<p>best negligence;
</p>
<p> 2. Such companies eventually sued for peace, seeking to bring in their, equally 
</p>
<p>vulnerable, competitors in creating coalitions that established non-statutory rules 
</p>
<p>that would appease their more engaged critics;
</p>
<p> 3. Such rules would be implemented subject to accountability mechanisms gener-
</p>
<p>ally focused on public disclosure and the on-going threat of civil re-action to 
</p>
<p>substandard performance;
</p>
<p> 4. Growing attempts by coalition members to bring in other parts of the industry, 
</p>
<p>both to extend the societal benefits and to level the competitive playing field;
</p>
<p> 5. Eventually in many instances statutory enforcement would be seen positively as 
</p>
<p>the costs and limitations of maintaining a purely voluntary approach became 
</p>
<p>increasingly apparent on all sides.
</p>
<p>Apparel and textiles was not the first sector to be subject to such approaches, 
</p>
<p>there is a long and noble history, from anti-Apartheid civil sanctions through to the 
</p>
<p>long and perhaps ever-lasting baby milk campaign targeted particularly at Nestle 
</p>
<p>(Zadek et&nbsp;al. 1998). Yet there has been a particular cache associated with actions 
</p>
<p>associated with the apparel and textiles sector. This special role of this sector arose 
</p>
<p>because of it&rsquo;s intensity and scale, the often-controversial involvement of the inter-
</p>
<p>national trade union movement, the linkage to international trade agreements, and 
</p>
<p>ultimately the iconic importance of the sector in the classical industrialization path-
</p>
<p>way of many developing countries.
</p>
<p>Such efforts yielded some positive results for many workers in premium product 
</p>
<p>value chains, as well as protecting the premium brands most vulnerable to the public 
</p>
<p>eye. Yet the events of April 2013&nbsp;in Bangladesh highlighted in terrible fashion the 
</p>
<p>limits of such approaches. The end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement in 2005, a 
</p>
<p>sector- specific trade access agreement, led to a rapid consolidation of Bangladesh&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>role in the global value chain. Cost considerations dominated the growth of 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh sourcing, with brand buyers increasingly willing to turn a blind eye to 
</p>
<p>endemic transgressions of their own code commitments. Two years on from the 
</p>
<p>disaster, the restitution by brands and the government of Bangladesh, both to the 
</p>
<p>families of the victims and more broadly in improving labor conditions, has fallen 
</p>
<p>short of both commitments and even modest expectations. The funds established to 
</p>
<p>serve the needs of those directly impacted have remained under-filled and inade-
</p>
<p>quately disbursed, echoing experience subsequent to the Bhopal disaster and else-
</p>
<p>where. There is little evidence, furthermore, of systematic improvements in labor 
</p>
<p>conditions in Bangladesh.
</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at least for some, these market dynamics, underpinned by 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh&rsquo;s failure to enforce its own labor laws, has seriously damaged confi-
</p>
<p>dence in voluntary labor and perhaps broader sustainability standards. That is not to 
</p>
<p>S. Zadek</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>135
</p>
<p>say that they do not continue to make a difference to specific groups and circum-
</p>
<p>stances. Furthermore, it is not to say that they should not be encouraged to deliver 
</p>
<p>what they can. However, it is to raise the inconvenient truth for many of us that have 
</p>
<p>invested over decades in making them work the question of how much they can 
</p>
<p>really deliver in the bigger scheme of things.
</p>
<p>It is in the light of such experience that the usefulness of the method and mes-
</p>
<p>sages contained in my article &lsquo;Pathways to Corporate Responsibility&rsquo;, published in 
</p>
<p>2004 by the Harvard Business Review, needs to be considered (Zadek 2004). 
</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that the article has been used productively to model 
</p>
<p>industry-wide, individual company progress, as well as broader societal processes, 
</p>
<p>as well as being used in business education (Zadek 2006). At the same time, civil 
</p>
<p>society actors with a more aggressive, skeptical or cynical attitude have pointed to 
</p>
<p>the dangers of the arguments underlying this and comparable articles as promoting 
</p>
<p>corporate white and green-washing. Whilst my personal attitudes or interests are not 
</p>
<p>relevant here, what is interesting is whether the underlying micro-to-macro learning 
</p>
<p>framework proposed in the article remain relevant and if so how. Ultimately, should 
</p>
<p>it be dismissed in the face of available evidence. Addressing these questions is the 
</p>
<p>focus of this paper, which reside within a wider analytic lens of whether and if so 
</p>
<p>when and how corporations are &ldquo;titans or titanics&rdquo; in the struggle for an inclusive, 
</p>
<p>sustainable economy (Zadek 2012).
</p>
<p>The next section,&ldquo;Pathways to Corporate Responsibility&rdquo;, briefly reviews the 
</p>
<p>framework presented in the original article, providing examples of its application in 
</p>
<p>practice. The third section, &ldquo;Critical Analysis of Pathways Framework&rdquo; provides a 
</p>
<p>critique of the framework, drawing on discussions and experience both with aca-
</p>
<p>demics and practitioners subsequent to its publication. The final section, &ldquo;The Civil 
</p>
<p>Corporation&rdquo; draws some basic conclusions and looks forward to how the micro-to- 
</p>
<p>macro learning framework might be evolved to work more effectively.
</p>
<p> Pathways to&nbsp;Corporate Responsibility
</p>
<p>Companies don&rsquo;t become model citizens overnight. Nike&rsquo;s metamorphosis from the poster 
</p>
<p>child for irresponsibility to a leader in progressive practices reveals the five stages of orga-
</p>
<p>nizational growth.
</p>
<p>Typically for an HBR article, this two-line kick off suggested a focus on the 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s growth and ultimately financial success. Whilst not wrong, the full and 
</p>
<p>more ambitious purpose of the article was to explore the complex and arguably 
</p>
<p>more enduring issue of the learning dynamic between a company and its shifting 
</p>
<p>societal context.
</p>
<p>The heartland of the article set out a simple framework that connected five stages 
</p>
<p>of organizational development with an equivalent set of societal learning stages. Set 
</p>
<p>against each other (Exhibit 7.1) for any specific issue, such as labour standards, the 
</p>
<p>article suggested that one might track and even predict the course of events as com-
</p>
<p>panies and societies evolve their appreciation of an issue and the associated locus of 
</p>
<p>accountability.

</p>
<p>&bull; For companies, they moved from a stage of denial that the issue in question was 
</p>
<p>their legitimate concern to a point in time when it was firmly embedded in the 
</p>
<p>very fabric of the markets within which they operated, whether through volun-
</p>
<p>tary or statutory action, or some combination of the two.
</p>
<p>&bull; Simultaneously, society went through its own learning experience, starting with 
</p>
<p>low awareness of the issue, and gradually evolving to a stage where it demands 
</p>
<p>that business should be held accountable for related outcomes.
</p>
<p>Set against each other on a two-dimensional plane, the framework suggested that 
</p>
<p>a company would be increasingly at risk if it failed to evolve through its staged 
</p>
<p>learning in the face of growing societal demands. For example, energy companies 
</p>
<p>refusing to acknowledge the role of carbon emissions in global warming might for 
</p>
<p>a long time be safe given the immature state of the associated debate and science, 
</p>
<p>but would eventually be challenged through pubic debate. Ultimately, they could 
</p>
<p>find themselves on the wrong side of policy developments, and perhaps even face 
</p>
<p>the consequences of their denial in court. The framework indicated that companies 
</p>
<p>could proactively design pathways along which they managed their scope of visible 
</p>
<p>accountability for broader societal issues in ways that were consistent with the 
</p>
<p>demands of their (ever-changing) stakeholders. In this way they could more effec-
</p>
<p>tively manage their risks, which should over time benefit their financial bottom line. 
</p>
<p>Energy companies, to continue the case in point, which joined forces with those 
</p>
<p>fighting for ambitious, international efforts to address climate change would find 
</p>
<p>themselves on the right side of public opinion, and potentially benefit from first

</p>
<p>mover opportunities in advancing cleaner technologies, perhaps by shaping such 
</p>
<p>markets though collaborative initiatives that leveraged enabling consumer and 
</p>
<p>investor and policy responses.
</p>
<p>Suggesting such linear, two-dimensional, non-reversible pathways was always 
</p>
<p>going to be a simplification at best, a matter to which we will return in section three. 
</p>
<p>First, however, it is useful to highlight possible uses of the framework. Below are 
</p>
<p>outlined three such uses: for public debate, internal to a major company, and the 
</p>
<p>third used for management consulting and linked to business school teaching. On 
</p>
<p>the first, it is interesting to note the comparative Apple-Nike mapping offered in the 
</p>
<p>face of Apple&rsquo;s first encounter with civil regulatory pressure over labour standards 
</p>
<p>in its Taiwanese, mainland-China based supplier, Foxconn (Exhibit 7.2). The map-
</p>
<p>ping sought to demonstrate Apple&rsquo;s lagging but closely tracking practice compared 
</p>
<p>to Nike&rsquo;s formative experience almost a decade previously. Whilst in no sense a 
</p>
<p>scientifically robust comparison, it does suggest that over time and between differ-
</p>
<p>ing contexts, the same evolutionary patterns can emerge. Sadly, it also suggests in 
</p>
<p>some instances limited meta-learning even when, as in this case, some of the same 
</p>
<p>civil society organisations were involved in both cases, such as the Fair Labour 
</p>
<p>Association, and indeed in some instances even the same individuals.
</p>
<p>On the second, use has been made of the tool to establish progress measurement 
</p>
<p>across diverse business units and for the business as a whole for the company in 
</p>
<p>question, the AXA Group. (Exhibit 7.3). The French insurance company has used 
</p>
<p>the tool over a number of years to develop a relatively detailed scoring system that 
</p>
<p>it applied annually to several dozen business units across the world. The scoring 
</p>
<p>system is then linked to a planning, budgeting and senior management reporting 
</p>
<p>process. In this instance, the company&rsquo;s corporate responsibility team had engen-
</p>
<p>dered a degree of friendly competition between business units, reinforced by the 
</p>
<p>fact that the results of the annual scoring was presented to, signed off by, the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s senior management team.
</p>
<p>As a final illustration, the framework has been adapted by myself for use in a 
</p>
<p>strategic management consulting context, an approach subsequently exposed

<p>Tsinghua School of Economics and Management in Beijing, as well as through a 
</p>
<p>course entitled &lsquo;Tri-Sectoral Collaboration&rsquo; delivered at the Singapore Management 
</p>
<p>University. The approach (Exhibit 7.4) below for the case of General Electric, maps 
</p>
<p>the inter-connectivity between product innovation (bottom left hand) and public 
</p>
<p>policy goals. In this case, the societal and organizational learning and engagement 
</p>
<p>is implicit to the analysis of the nexus between product, policy and brand.

<p> Critical Analysis of&nbsp;Pathways Framework
</p>
<p>The framework presented in the original HBR article embodies some important, 
</p>
<p>simplifying assumptions that are worthy of greater exploration. Implied in the 
</p>
<p>framework is a linearity and apparent non-reversibility of the organizational and 
</p>
<p>societal learning. Clearly this is an inadequate reflection of reality, and may be a 
</p>
<p>problematic over-simplification. For example, the Bangladesh case of apparel and 
</p>
<p>textiles provided in the opening part of this essay demonstrates the dangers of 
</p>
<p>assuming continuous improvement. Indeed, not only are reversals possible, but also 
</p>
<p>possible is a simple levelling out or capping of improvements, such as we have wit-
</p>
<p>nessed in the area of anti-corruption, despite a decade of intensive, international 
</p>
<p>efforts through a combination of collaborative and legislative approaches. The case 
</p>
<p>can be made, at least for some corporate examples, that companies can lead on 
</p>
<p>aspects of responsible business practices for a period of time, and then decline in 
</p>
<p>energy, leadership and positive outcomes. BP provides a case in point, which under 
</p>
<p>John Brown&rsquo;s leadership opened new avenues for corporate responsibility in the 
</p>
<p>field of anti-corruption through its role in forming the Extractive Industry 
</p>
<p>Transparency Initiative (EITI) and climate change, and his infamous Stanford 
</p>
<p>School speech on the influence of fossil fuel use in climate change. Today, however, 
</p>
<p>following a series of unfortunate and often self-inflicted disasters, the company is at 
</p>
<p>best an ailing oil and gas-focused multinational that has essentially no leadership 
</p>
<p>role in shaping tomorrow&rsquo;s energy transition, let alone the broader global political 
</p>
<p>economy. Similar arguments can be presented for earlier iconic ethical brands such 
</p>
<p>as The Body Shop and Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s, and perhaps in the future will be relevant for 
</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s leaders (Zadek 2012).
</p>
<p>Further limitations of the framework, at least in its published form, can be under-
</p>
<p>stood best through a game-theoretic lens. The framework is focused on market- 
</p>
<p>societal dynamics that encourage pre-competitive and collectively-competitive 
</p>
<p>collaborative advantage, that in turn may lead to changed market conditions that 
</p>
<p>reward more responsible behaviour. Whilst there are many such cases, such a path-
</p>
<p>way is certainly not the only option. Under some circumstances, positively, the need 
</p>
<p>for collaboration to create the potential for first mover advantages in overcoming 
</p>
<p>negative societal externalities becomes redundant in the face of positive market 
</p>
<p>dynamics. The falling cost of solar is a case in point, as the earlier need for public- 
</p>
<p>private collaboration to overcome cost disadvantages is superseded by the simple 
</p>
<p>dynamic of market-based competitiveness. In other instances, free riding makes 
</p>
<p>collaboration less advantageous and in the limit undermines such approaches. 
</p>
<p>Financing coal-fired power stations is a case in point, where international coopera-
</p>
<p>tion in cutting off financing for carbon-intensive power generation has been under-
</p>
<p>mined by sources of finance unwilling to impose such restrictions. In fact, the case 
</p>
<p>of Bangladesh is a great illustration of the destructive power of free riding in that 
</p>
<p>many brand companies concluded that they could not afford not to source in 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh given the associated cost advantages.

</p>
<p>The point here is not that the published version of the framework is wrong per se. 
</p>
<p>It is that it is a simple modelling of what is at its core a complex dynamic between 
</p>
<p>market, policy, political and broader societal forces. The challenge with such mod-
</p>
<p>els is of course to ensure that it has value because and despite such simplifications, 
</p>
<p>and so does not dilute the power of more specific, evidence based analysis.
</p>
<p> The Civil Corporation
</p>
<p>The strengths and weaknesses of the framework can be still better understood by 
</p>
<p>adding political economy to that of competitiveness and strategy analysis. The orig-
</p>
<p>inal HBR article was informed by the thinking expressed in an earlier piece of writ-
</p>
<p>ing, The Civil Corporation. Finalised in early 2000, its opening lines highlight its 
</p>
<p>focus on a business&rsquo; degrees of freedom to act, and enabling capabilities:
</p>
<p>Judging and ultimately guiding corporate performance requires an examination of whether 
</p>
<p>a business is doing what it can do given its range of external options and internal competen-
</p>
<p>cies. Internally, this concerns the formal, explicit policies and processes, organizational 
</p>
<p>cultures and values, and patterns of leadership. Externally, this is a question of the multitude 
</p>
<p>of business drivers, from direct, short-term market pressures through to longer-term strate-
</p>
<p>gic challenges and opportunities.
</p>
<p>A business&rsquo;s contribution to sustainable development therefore needs to be understood 
</p>
<p>in terms of its viable options and what it makes of them. Internal and external factors 
</p>
<p>together create a spectrum of possibilities at any point in time&nbsp;&ndash; that define a corporation&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>practical scope for making decisions between viable choices. Whether and how a corpora-
</p>
<p>tion acts within its degrees of freedom must be the test of responsibility, and indeed the 
</p>
<p>basis on which management decisions are framed.
</p>
<p>These are the fundamentals of the civil corporation. A corporation that is said to be civil 
</p>
<p>is understood here as one that takes full advantage of opportunities for learning and action 
</p>
<p>in building social and environmental objectives into its core business by effectively develop-
</p>
<p>ing its internal values and competencies (Zadek 2001; italics added)
</p>
<p>Reflecting 5&nbsp;years later in a new introductory chapter to the second edition of the 
</p>
<p>same book, that is, after the publication of the HBR article, my argument focused 
</p>
<p>more on the tougher issue of accountability as compared to the softer processes of 
</p>
<p>engagement and collaboration, and the linkages between business accountability 
</p>
<p>and the broader political economy:
</p>
<p>Extending accountabilities of business place it and the state increasingly on a par with each 
</p>
<p>other in key respects. We see a convergence in their legitimacies despite their very different 
</p>
<p>historical foundations, one in security, mediation and political representation and the other 
</p>
<p>through their production of material needs and returns to finance capital. Such a conver-
</p>
<p>gence is accelerated by several factors, including the declining legitimacy of traditional 
</p>
<p>electoral routes to the politics of representation, the emerging political empowerment of 
</p>
<p>citizens through their roles in markets, notably as owners of capital, and the growing preva-
</p>
<p>lence and visibility of complex partnerships involving public and private actors tasked to 
</p>
<p>deliver public and indeed private goods (Zadek 2007).
</p>
<p>That is, the process simply described in the framework could lead to fundamental 
</p>
<p>changes in societies&rsquo; institutional landscape. Notable in this could be the unintended 
</p>
<p>S. Zadek</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>141
</p>
<p>erosion of the specialized distinctions of market and non-market actors and their 
</p>
<p>associated basis of accountability and legitimacy, particularly as businesses became 
</p>
<p>legitimate partners in the development of market-governing rules. Such concerns 
</p>
<p>are far from pure theory. It lay at the heart of heated public debate, for example, as 
</p>
<p>to whether the now-collapsed trans-Asian and trans-Atlantic trade agreements being 
</p>
<p>proposed by the US should allow for businesses to directly challenge the legality of 
</p>
<p>government&rsquo;s rights to impose laws within their own sovereign jurisdiction through 
</p>
<p>a distinct dispute mechanism established independently of, and not subject to review 
</p>
<p>by, any one state&rsquo;s judicial process.
</p>
<p>Such a political economy lens is very much on the radar of senior executives of 
</p>
<p>companies whose political influence has become visibly greater in the face of mar-
</p>
<p>ket concentration, globalization and economic and financial muscle. It has proved 
</p>
<p>uncomfortable to many energy and mining companies, for example, that the EITI 
</p>
<p>essentially uses them as conduits to improve the public accountability of, in the 
</p>
<p>main democratically elected, host governments. Similarly for the Global Network 
</p>
<p>Initiative, that seeks to leverage the brand sensitivity of companies like Microsoft, 
</p>
<p>Google and Facebook to call into question the rights of governments to acquire 
</p>
<p>information about citizen&rsquo;s using the internet.
</p>
<p>In effect, the pathways to corporate responsibility presented in the framework 
</p>
<p>suggest a growing tension between the &lsquo;intensive&rsquo; and &lsquo;extensive&rsquo; basis of account-
</p>
<p>ability. The former, in a corporate context, concerns the primacy of financial share-
</p>
<p>holders, typical of Anglo-Saxon corporate governance approaches. Extensive 
</p>
<p>accountability, on the other hand, provides for accountability to multiple interests, 
</p>
<p>that could indeed go well beyond requirements imposed through the rule of law. Far 
</p>
<p>from reducing companies&rsquo; competitive dynamics, this tension extends its scope and 
</p>
<p>places new pressures on the modern corporation that can only be met through the 
</p>
<p>development and application of new capabilities and indeed forms of 
</p>
<p>accountability.
</p>
<p>Such reflections led me to reflect, 5&nbsp;years further on, in 2012, whether there was 
</p>
<p>now a need for:
</p>
<p>A &lsquo;public fiduciary&rsquo; (to) replace the current, narrow focus of corporate governance of opti-
</p>
<p>mizing solely in favour of financial stakeholders. The dominant corporate governance 
</p>
<p>model for publicly-listed companies, broadly the Anglo-Saxon approach, would be over-
</p>
<p>turned in favour of a pluralistic approach where corporate directors&rsquo; fiduciary responsibility 
</p>
<p>required them to address financial and broader sustainability outcomes.
</p>
<p>Once again, such a view is far from being abstract. Adjustments to corporate 
</p>
<p>governance and associated decision-making to incorporate broader sustainability 
</p>
<p>issues are increasingly a mainstream discussion and in some instances practice, 
</p>
<p>from changes to South Africa&rsquo;s pension legislation to broader trustees&rsquo; fiduciary 
</p>

</p>
<p> Enhancing the&nbsp;Pathways Framework
</p>
<p>My review of the original framework presented in the HBR article published over a 
</p>
<p>decade ago highlights both its uses and arguably usefulness, as well as some of its 
</p>
<p>flaws, or at least limitations. On the former, the framework reasonably describes the 
</p>
<p>direction of travel in many instances of the organically extending sphere of respon-
</p>
<p>sibility of business, and the manner in which market and societal dynamics over 
</p>
<p>time internalize market outcomes that were previously externalities to business 
</p>
<p>strategies and the financial bottom line. Moreover, the framework breaks down the 
</p>
<p>apparent polarity of individual and collective action, and market collective and pol-
</p>
<p>icy and regulatory-framed actions, pointing to their interactive dynamic over time. 
</p>
<p>These strengths have led to the framework being used in varied contexts, with a 
</p>
<p>modestly productive effect as far as one can see.
</p>
<p>On the matter of limitations, two in particular have been highlighted: the frame-
</p>
<p>work&rsquo;s over-simplified, linear, teleological assumptions and its associated lack of 
</p>
<p>depth in considering alternative competitiveness dynamics; and its failure to spell 
</p>
<p>out the potential, political economy feedback effects and deeper institutional impli-
</p>
<p>cations. Of course, such flaws and limitations could equally be described as issues 
</p>
<p>and aspects brought to light by the framework, enabling discussion and analysis. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, such a, more positive, view would be supported by the experience of apply-
</p>
<p>ing the framework in practice, as in the ways highlighted in the preceding section. 
</p>
<p>That said, these limitations also constrain the effective application of the framework, 
</p>
<p>and invite further theoretical developments to underpin future iterations of this or 
</p>
<p>comparable frameworks for practical use. Of interest, that is, is how to improve our 
</p>
<p>analytic capabilities in understanding, and actively promoting, the more effective 
</p>
<p>incorporation of sustainable development considerations into business strategy and 
</p>
<p>the broader political economy that shapes markets and associated outcomes.
</p>
<p>It is a mute point as to whether work at this nexus can be usefully subject to a 
</p>
<p>singular, analytic framework given the very different, and often contested, narra-
</p>
<p>tives governing each of these domains. More likely, is that the intersections of these 
</p>
<p>narratives will be approached through experimentation and associated analysis, the 
</p>
<p>deliberate juxtaposition of different narratives, and experiential work to enable 
</p>
<p>deeper, practitioner learning. That said, any or all of these approaches might benefit 
</p>
<p>from some simple analytic rules of the road that draw from and extend beyond the 
</p>
<p>original framework, including a focus on the:
</p>
<p>&bull; Dynamic interactions between organizational and societal learning.
</p>
<p>&bull; Merits and dynamics of diverse forms of collective action.
</p>
<p>&bull; Evolving product-to-public policy strategies for both business and public interest 
</p>
<p>bodies.
</p>
<p>&bull; Developing decision making at the intersection of intensive and extensive 
</p>
<p>accountabilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Shifting macro-institutional architectures, often precipitated by micro-dynamics.
</p>
<p>Finally, the shifting geo-political context provides an important macro-driver for 
</p>
<p>reconfiguring our understanding of the territory crystallized through the framework 
</p>
<p>S. Zadek</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>143
</p>
<p>and framed more broadly by narratives, analysis and practice regarding responsibil-
</p>
<p>ity, accountability and collaboration in the pursuit of private benefits and public 
</p>
<p>goods. Much of what has been written seeks to do no more than explain and guide 
</p>
<p>markets that exist within broadly liberal political economies. In these contexts, we 
</p>
<p>understandably focus on associated forms of societal learning and organization. As 
</p>
<p>a result, we tend to model the evolution of collaboration between private and public 
</p>
<p>actors from an assumed starting point of their separate and distinct activities and 
</p>
<p>realms of accountability.
</p>
<p>Such assumptions were always simplifications of liberal political economies. Yet 
</p>
<p>as I have argued above and elsewhere, such assumptions have often proved reason-
</p>
<p>ably useful frames of reference. Civil society clearly does make a difference, and 
</p>
<p>many spheres of business have taken on aspects of social and environmental respon-
</p>
<p>sibility that would have been unthinkable in the past (Zadek 2012). With each step 
</p>
<p>forward into the twenty-first century, however, such assumptions become more sus-
</p>
<p>pect. Inter-twinned relationships between business and government can no longer 
</p>
<p>be usefully modeled as distinct, necessitating the darker side of collaboration to be 
</p>
<p>more clearly understood in the context of any narrative about public-private partner-
</p>
<p>ships in pursuit of public goods. From Delhi to London, the power of civil society 
</p>
<p>to shape markets and political processes is under threat. At the same time, decidedly 
</p>
<p>un-civil politics may deliver positive outcomes. The success of the climate negotia-
</p>
<p>tions in Paris, for example, depends largely on the leadership of un-liberal societies 
</p>
<p>and political leaderships, notably China.
</p>
<p>Shaping corporate responsibility going forward will need to take place, and 
</p>
<p>hopefully succeed in this changing context. Learning pathways and associated insti-
</p>
<p>tutional innovations and actions in the context of competition and collaboration will 
</p>
<p>remain fundamental to any change processes. In this sense, the framework discussed 
</p>
<p>in this essay does contain the core elements that we will continue to work with, both 
</p>
<p>as analysts and activists, albeit configured to a changing world.

</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>On April 22nd 2014, after a difficult year in which GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) had 
</p>
<p>been accused of bribery in China and fined $3&nbsp;billion by American regulators for 
</p>
<p>marketing malpractice in the US, the pharmaceutical company announced a com-
</p>
<p>plex three-part restructuring deal with Swiss giant Novartis. The deal, one of a slew 
</p>
<p>of multibillion-dollar deals in the global pharmaceutical industry, would allow GSK 
</p>
<p>to focus on four key business areas&nbsp;&ndash; HIV, vaccines, respiratory conditions and con-
</p>
<p>sumer healthcare. It was seen as a win-win deal, offering both companies econo-
</p>
<p>mies of scale that were increasingly vital for &lsquo;big pharma&rsquo;. Analysts believed it 
</p>
<p>would &lsquo;unlock significant shareholder value&rsquo;, not least because it would allow GSK 
</p>
<p>to return &pound;4&nbsp;billion to investors through a B share scheme.
</p>
<p>But would it be a win-win deal for patients? Particularly patients in developing 
</p>
<p>countries where, despite a dramatic drop in the price of first-line antiretroviral 
</p>
<p>(ARV) medicines following a sensational court case in South Africa from which 
</p>
<p>GSK and other pharmaceuticals had withdrawn, millions of people still lacked 
</p>
<p>access to essential medicines and vaccines.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today we live longer, healthier lives on average than at any time in history. Global life expectancy 
increased faster in the last 40&nbsp;years than it did in the preceding 4000&nbsp;&ndash; but not all groups benefited 
equally&rdquo;.

<p>While refocusing and re-energising its business portfolio, how best could GSK 
</p>
<p>respond to calls that it had a social responsibility to provide affordable and appropri-
</p>
<p>ate medicines and vaccines? How could it reconcile the demands of patients&rsquo; for 
</p>
<p>treatment with its need to earn profits and protect its patents? Would it pass CEO 
</p>
<p>Andrew Witty&rsquo;s key test of &ldquo;whether you make decisions that are applauded by soci-
</p>
<p>ety or condemned by society.&rdquo;1 What would be the effect on GSK&rsquo;s operations in 
</p>
<p>other countries and its business model if it allowed the existing patent regime to be 
</p>
<p>selectively ignored, or it didn&rsquo;t earn enough to finance further drug innovation? It 
</p>
<p>seemed as if the pressure would continue no matter what the company did.
</p>
<p> Background Events from&nbsp;2000
</p>
<p> GSK in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Early Years and&nbsp;the&nbsp;HIV/AIDS Pandemic
</p>
<p>When GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was formed on 27 December 2000 through the merger 
</p>
<p>of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKlineBeecham,2 both leading pharmaceutical companies 
</p>
<p>in Europe, the idea that providing access to medicine in the world&rsquo;s least developed 
</p>
<p>countries (LDCs) was a corporate social responsibility was beginning to get media and 
</p>
<p>NGO attention. A campaign for access championed by M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res was 
</p>
<p>alerting society to the health needs of LDCs. For the World Health Organisation 
</p>
<p>(WHO), health was a fundamental human right; three of the UN&rsquo;s eight Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals3 were related to health, aimed at reducing child mortality (MDG 
</p>
<p>4), maternal mortality (MDG 5)and the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria (MDG 6).
</p>
<p>On 11 January 2001, the new CEO of GSK, Jean-Pierre Garnier, made his first 
</p>
<p>in-house address, broadcast to employees around the world by satellite. Describing 
</p>
<p>his aspirations for the company, he said: &ldquo;The pharmaceutical industry today sells 
</p>
<p>80% of its products to 20% of the world&rsquo;s population. I don&rsquo;t want to be the CEO of 
</p>
<p>a company that only caters to the rich&hellip; I want those medicines in the hands of 
</p>
<p>many more people who need them.&rdquo; Garnier&rsquo;s statement struck a chord with many 
</p>
<p>employees, glad to be working for a company committed to improving health and 
</p>
<p>lives around the world.
</p>
<p>At the time, GSK dominated the global market for HIV/AIDS therapies, with a 
</p>
<p>40% market share. It was the only company involved in R&amp;D on all three top prior-
</p>
<p>ity diseases of the WHO&nbsp;&ndash; malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS.&nbsp;Not only was 
</p>
<p>resistance of TB and malaria to treatment increasing, it was estimated that more 
</p>
<p>than 53&nbsp;million men, women and children had HIV, 3&nbsp;million had died of AIDS and

2 with Glaxo and SmithKline shareholders holding approximately 58.75% and 41.25% of the share 
capital of GSK respectively. The deal created the second largest research-based pharmaceutical 
and healthcare company in the world, with a global workforce in excess of 100,000 and a com-
bined market capitalisation of &pound;114&nbsp;billion.

Summit of the United Nations in 2000, with targets to be achieved by 2015.

</p>
<p>40&nbsp;million were living with AIDS.4 Two thirds of HIV cases were in sub-Saharan 
</p>
<p>Africa. Recognised as a real threat to global social and economic progress, AIDS 
</p>
<p>was declared by the US government to be a threat to international security.
</p>
<p>Although it could take several years, most people who were HIV-positive would 
</p>
<p>develop full-blown AIDS as the body&rsquo;s immune system shut down, and there was no 
</p>
<p>cure. Without access to treatment, people could die within 6&nbsp;months, leaving fami-
</p>
<p>lies and the community devastated. For LDCs the effects were particularly acute, 
</p>
<p>crippling their economies by depriving them of millions of productive employees 
</p>
<p>and orphaning millions of children.5
</p>
<p>Drug treatment could increase the quality and duration of life for HIV-positive 
</p>
<p>individuals, but cost $10,000&ndash;15,000 per patient per year, and required ongoing 
</p>
<p>medical supervision, particularly for the complex &ldquo;triple drug cocktails&rdquo;. Treatment 
</p>
<p>was therefore beyond the reach of LDCs, where, according to the UN, more than 
</p>
<p>1.2&nbsp;billion people (including 291&nbsp;million in sub-Saharan Africa) were living on less 
</p>
<p>than $1 a day.6 Less than 1% of HIV/AIDS victims in need of ARV treatment in 
</p>
<p>sub-Saharan Africa were receiving it.
</p>
<p>Drawing attention to the price of HIV/AIDS drugs in LDCs, activists argued that 
</p>
<p>patent protection regimes resulted in premium prices that restricted access to essential 
</p>
<p>drugs, resulting in unnecessary suffering and millions dying in the developing world. As 
</p>
<p>James Sherry, then Director of Programme Development for UNAIDS, put it: &ldquo;The bot-
</p>
<p>tom line is that people who are dying from AIDS don&rsquo;t matter in this world.&rdquo;7
</p>
<p>Glaxo had worked voluntarily with government in LDCs to progressively reduce 
</p>
<p>prices on HIV/AIDS drugs on a country-by-country basis. It even published its dis-
</p>
<p>counted price list (other companies kept their lists confidential). But such actions 
</p>
<p>failed to silence the critics, who argued that these price reductions were small and 
</p>
<p>did not constitute a long-term framework to ensure essential drugs reached the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s poor. Garnier was favourably disposed to addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis 
</p>
<p>and the issue of access generally. He felt the industry could do more in partnership 
</p>
<p>with governments and that GSK should be at the forefront, but the sheer scale of the 
</p>
<p>pandemic was overwhelming.
</p>
<p>On February 12 2001, Oxfam International, a confederation of 12 NGOs, launched 
</p>
<p>a &lsquo;Cut the Cost&rsquo; campaign aimed at pressuring pharmaceutical companies to make 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS treatments available and affordable for people in LDCs. The campaigners 
</p>
<p>argued that enforcement of global patent rules kept drug prices high in LDCs&nbsp;&ndash; which 
</p>
<p>they considered morally wrong. Oxfam challenged GSK to offer comprehensive 
</p>
<p>access to essential medicines and redress the balance between treatment in the devel-
</p>
<p>oping and developed world. Joined by other prominent NGOs such as the Nobel 
</p>
<p>Prize-winning M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and Treatment Action Campaign (a cham-
</p>
<p>pion of the access issue in South Africa) it became clear that this was a challenge to

</p>
<p>the industry&rsquo;s traditional business model. Determining how to respond would have 
</p>
<p>profound strategic implications for GSK and the industry as a whole.
</p>
<p> The South African Court Case
</p>
<p>In South Africa, where the AIDS pandemic was the main cause of death, the Medical 
</p>
<p>Research Council estimated that over 4&nbsp;million (20%) adults were HIV-positive, yet 
</p>
<p>only a fraction were aware they had HIV.&nbsp;AIDS activists under the banner of the 
</p>
<p>Treatment Action Campaign, lobbied the government to disregard patent protection 
</p>
<p>of specific drugs to allow generic copies to be made, in contravention of the WTO&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, due to 
</p>
<p>come into effect from 2000.
</p>
<p>Under intense public pressure, the Minister of Health authorized generic ver-
</p>
<p>sions of patented drugs to be manufactured or imported and distributed, inciting a 
</p>
<p>consortium of 39 pharmaceutical companies, including GSK, to take court action 
</p>
<p>for violating the TRIPS agreement. The highly publicised case was heard in 
</p>
<p>Johannesburg on 5 March 2001. Dating back to 1998, the dispute about the enforce-
</p>
<p>ment of drug licensing and regulatory systems in South Africa was now perceived 
</p>
<p>as a conflict between &lsquo;big pharma&rsquo; defending its intellectual property (patents) and 
</p>
<p>President Nelson Mandela, defending poor people dying from AIDs.
</p>
<p>The resulting anger and contempt for drug companies convinced many people 
</p>
<p>that there was a case for patent infringement to give access to lifesaving HIV/AIDS 
</p>
<p>drugs. But there was also another agenda, as Pien later observed, &ldquo;The geographies 
</p>
<p>have become intermingled and the South African court case made it so. Opinion 
</p>
<p>leaders in the US, Europe and the developing countries have shifted their focus of 
</p>
<p>concern. Availability of a drug was not the core of the problem, but how a company 
</p>
<p>behaved as a corporate citizen. That was the real problem.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In April 2001, the drug companies dropped the case. The Boston Globe com-
</p>
<p>mented, &ldquo;With their boardrooms raided and their executives being hounded in the 
</p>
<p>streets, 39 of the world&rsquo;s largest drug makers caved in to public pressure&hellip; It was 
</p>
<p>hailed as a stunning triumph for the developing world: A $360&nbsp;billion industry was 
</p>
<p>brought down by a country that represents just half of one percent of the pharmaceu-
</p>
<p>tical market.&rdquo;8
</p>
<p> Post-merger: Facing the&nbsp;Challenge
</p>
<p>But criticism of the industry continued despite its withdrawal. At GSK&rsquo;s AGM on 
</p>
<p>May 21, 2001, campaigners from Oxfam wearing lab coats called for GSK to do 
</p>
<p>more for LDCs by donating a percentage of drug revenues to a &ldquo;global health fund&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>of the UN Secretary General. CEO Garnier&rsquo;s unprecedented response took some

</p>
<p>analysts by surprise. Defending GSK&rsquo;s actions on the access issue, he asserted that 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s priority was public health, not simply shareholder value: &ldquo;We have 
</p>
<p>to make a profit for our shareholders, but the primary objective of any policy put 
</p>
<p>forward in the industry is public health.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>On June 11 2001, in a policy document entitled &lsquo;Facing the Challenge: Our con-
</p>
<p>tribution to improving healthcare in the developing world&rsquo;, GSK made commit-
</p>
<p>ments in three areas:
</p>
<p> 1. Continuing investment in R&amp;D on diseases that affect the developing world.
</p>
<p> 2. Offering sustainable preferential (not-for-profit) pricing arrangements in LDCs 
</p>
<p>and sub-Saharan Africa for &lsquo;available medicines that are needed most&rsquo;.
</p>
<p> 3. Taking a leading role in community activities to promote effective healthcare.
</p>
<p>The main emphasis was on developing and providing HIV/AIDS and anti- 
</p>
<p>malarial medicines at preferential prices. Sustainability&nbsp;&ndash; the ability to deliver over 
</p>
<p>the long term&nbsp; &ndash; would be the key criterion for any action. Pien explained the 
</p>
<p>approach:
</p>
<p>In the establishment of the preferential price, we don&rsquo;t intend to make any profit from it. 
</p>
<p>What we want to do is make it sustainable. So, our internal decision algorithm in determin-
</p>
<p>ing the preferential price involves fully charging the components of manufacturing, includ-
</p>
<p>ing overhead&mdash;so variable costs plus overhead. But we don&rsquo;t try to recover R&amp;D 
</p>
<p>expenditures, we don&rsquo;t try to recover commercial expenses&mdash;sales and marketing expenses. 
</p>
<p>But then we get into this problem that is at the crux of health care delivery for HIV/
</p>
<p>AIDS.&nbsp;How do we get the products into the hands of the people who say that they are going 
</p>
<p>to be in a position to take this drug and do something good with it? In certain ravaged parts 
</p>
<p>of the world, it is impossible to get the products in the hands of the clinics.
</p>
<p>Several NGOs welcomed the GSK policy document. Sophia Tickell, Senior 
</p>
<p>Policy Advisor to Oxfam, commented: &ldquo;This is really positive. It is better than all 
</p>
<p>the other initiatives the industry suggested.&rdquo; Others remained sceptical.
</p>
<p> Access to&nbsp;Medicines and&nbsp;Implementation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Access Policy
</p>
<p>Implementing access proved to be a tough challenge. On 3 October 2002, the Dutch 
</p>
<p>authorities were forced to recall GSK&rsquo;s Combivir and Epivir AIDS drugs after dis-
</p>
<p>covering that, &ldquo;AIDS drugs supplied to Africa at cut rates have been illegally resold 
</p>
<p>in Europe, threatening to undermine a system of preferential medicine pricing for 
</p>
<p>poor countries.&rdquo;9 More than 35,000 drug packets intended for Africa (with a market 
</p>
<p>value of approximately &euro;15&nbsp; million) had been resold in the Netherlands and 
</p>
<p>Germany. A GSK spokesman said, &ldquo;We are appalled and saddened to see this. The 
</p>
<p>victims of this illegal trade are the HIV/AIDS patients of Africa.&rdquo; Because the

</p>
<p>packaging intended for Africa was identical to that used in the Netherlands and 
</p>
<p>Germany, all packets had to be recalled from the market for safety reasons.
</p>
<p>A 2002 Oxfam10 report entitled &lsquo;Beyond philanthropy&rsquo; challenged the pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical industry to adopt policies in five areas: R&amp;D, patents, pricing, joint public/
</p>
<p>private initiatives and the appropriate use of medicines. Treatment Action Campaign 
</p>
<p>(TAC) and MSF campaigned to &lsquo;Fix the Patent Laws&rsquo;. Protesters said that patents 
</p>
<p>on drugs and prohibitive prices prevented access to affordable medicines for people 
</p>
<p>in developing countries. They argued that big pharma charged the highest price the 
</p>
<p>market would bear, even if that made the product unaffordable for government 
</p>
<p>health programmes and the poor.11 With its slogan &lsquo;Life is priceless: medicine is 
</p>
<p>not&rsquo;, Christian Aid captured the indignation felt when activists asked &lsquo;Are profits 
</p>
<p>more important than people&rsquo;s lives?&rsquo; Big pharma, they insisted, had both the means 
</p>
<p>and a moral obligation to do something, citing article 25 of the Universal Declaration 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights: &ldquo;everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the 
</p>
<p>health and well-being of himself and his family, including&hellip; Medical care&hellip; 
</p>
<p>Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Big pharma countered that patents only represented a small portion of total 
</p>
<p>healthcare costs and that poverty was the real problem, not patents,12 pointing out 
</p>
<p>that over 95% of the 325 drugs on the WHO&rsquo;s Essential Drugs List were not patent- 
</p>
<p>protected. GSK faced a number of complex dilemmas. If they offered differential 
</p>
<p>prices for people within poor countries, governments elsewhere would ask for the 
</p>
<p>same prices. Not all people within developing countries were poor&nbsp;&ndash; why should a 
</p>
<p>millionaire pay less because he lived in a poor country? Countries like India had 
</p>
<p>huge disparities in terms of wealth: how could they assist people living below the 
</p>
<p>poverty line in these countries? What about poor people in rich countries? If they 
</p>
<p>offered lower prices in LDCs, what would stop someone re-exporting and selling at 
</p>
<p>a higher price and pocketing the difference?13 And which medicines should be 
</p>
<p>selected for lower prices?
</p>
<p>Activists advocated the development of generic medicines (infringing patents by 
</p>
<p>copying medicines) as a solution, but pharmaceutical companies argued that if their 
</p>
<p>monopolies/profits were eroded in this way, it would restrict their R&amp;D in the 
</p>
<p>future, and ultimately lead to fewer new drugs and more lives being lost as a result.
</p>
<p>GSK felt that an alternative approach was more sustainable, as explained in its 
</p>
<p>second Social and Environmental Report (2003):
</p>
<p>We set our preferential prices for ARVs and anti-malarials at levels that cover direct costs 
but on which we do not make a profit. In this way we can offer these prices for as long as 
patients need treatment.&rdquo; By 2004, GSK had supplied 120&nbsp; million preferentially-priced

<p>ARV medicines to the developing world. While some welcomed GSKs approach of &ldquo;open-
ing up developing-world markets to expensive drugs&rdquo;, others charged that &ldquo;the reality is 
that preferential pricing is simply a market penetration and patent protection strategy,&rdquo;14 or 
felt that the figures were not set in context, asking &ldquo;Is the provision of anti-retrovirals&hellip; a 
large percentage of those needed in the developing world or not?15
</p>
<p>Once the TRIPS agreement16 came into force in 2005, copying patented medi-
</p>
<p>cines became illegal and companies could no longer produce new medicines generi-
</p>
<p>cally. Some industry observers suggested that hostility between pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies and activists could be avoided if &ldquo;restricted voluntary licenses were 
</p>
<p>offered for essential medicines in developed countries. This would allow competi-
</p>
<p>tion to lower prices for branded medicines in developing countries, while preserving 
</p>
<p>profitability in the core pharmaceutical markets in rich countries.&rdquo;17
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Oxfam claimed that pharmaceutical companies prevented poor 
</p>
<p>people from accessing inexpensive generic versions of essential medicines through 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;persistent inflexibility on intellectual property protection, and in some cases active 
</p>
<p>lobbying for stricter patent rules and legal challenges to governments&rsquo; use of TRIPS 
</p>
<p>public-health safeguards&rdquo;.18 It argued that: &ldquo;Society expects pharmaceutical compa-
</p>
<p>nies&nbsp;&ndash; with their privileged access to a global market&nbsp;&ndash; to develop necessary prod-
</p>
<p>ucts at prices that are affordable, in presentations that are usable, and to market them 
</p>
<p>ethically. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to fulfil these requirements reli-
</p>
<p>ably and sustainably, and by so doing, play its part in the wider responsibilities to 
</p>
<p>improve the health of all.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As of 2007, Oxfam applied stringent assessment criteria for access to medicines 
</p>
<p>on which it measured each company&rsquo;s performance on three key dimensions: R&amp;D, 
</p>
<p>pricing strategy and intellectual property (see Exhibit 8.1). GSK was assessed to 
</p>
<p>have achieved &ldquo;management buy-in&rdquo; within R&amp;D, to be seeking to &ldquo;manage repu-
</p>
<p>tational risks&rdquo; in its pricing strategy, and to be &ldquo;adopting a defensive attitude&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>towards intellectual property. Helena Vines Fiestas, policy adviser for Oxfam,19 
</p>
<p>commented that &ldquo;GSK is probably the leading company within the sector. But it still 
</p>
<p>falls far short of a desirable position.&rdquo;20

<p>In 2009, when Andrew Witty succeeded Garnier as CEO of GSK, he stated that 
</p>
<p>it was &ldquo;unreasonable to expect people in poorer countries to contribute to Western 
</p>
<p>shareholders.&rdquo;21 Witty pledged that GSK would cap prices for its drugs in the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>50 LDCs at 25% of developed world prices, share patents for dozens of compounds, 
</p>
<p>tackle neglected diseases in the developing world, and invest in health infrastruc-
</p>
<p>ture. He explained that &ldquo;Price cannot be a barrier to access. So we need to get the 
</p>
<p>price right and we need to work with the international community to mobilise the 
</p>
<p>resources to pay for it and the infrastructure needed to deliver, not least to remote 
</p>
<p>communities.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>But although GSK reduced the price of vaccines and a number of patented medi-
</p>
<p>cines in LDCs to no more than 25% of those charged in developed countries, pro-
</p>
<p>viding that this covered the manufacturing costs, for millions of people its medicines 
</p>
<p>were still not cheap enough. Duncan Learmouth, GSK&rsquo;s SVP of corporate 
</p>
<p>Communications and Global Community Partnerships, admitted: &ldquo;We are under no 
</p>
<p>illusions that even at 25% of developed world prices, those prices are still high for 
</p>
<p>the developing world.&rdquo;22 To address the lack of healthcare infrastructure, GSK rein-
</p>
<p>vested 20% of the profits it generated in LDCs back into the countries for strength-
</p>
<p>ening healthcare infrastructure and community programmes.23 Between 2009 and 
</p>
<p>2013, this amounted to &pound;15&nbsp;million (via partners) donations to train frontline com-
</p>
<p>munity health workers who were the key to getting medicines and vaccines to 
</p>
<p>remote rural areas.
</p>
<p>On 30th October 2009, GSK and Pfizer launched a global specialist HIV com-
</p>
<p>pany, ViiV Healthcare (GSK held 85%, Pfizer 15%), aiming to build on their suc-
</p>
<p>cesses to develop and provide access to HIV treatments and care for people living 
</p>
<p>with HIV.&nbsp; Through ViiV Healthcare, GSK granted voluntary licenses to generic 
</p>
<p>companies for the manufacture and supply of ARV medicines destined for sub- 
</p>
<p>Saharan Africa. ViiV Healthcare made three commitments:
</p>
<p> 1. A &lsquo;not-for-profit&rsquo; price commitment for its ARV portfolio to government and 
</p>
<p>international procurement agencies such as the Global Fund for AIDS, 
</p>
<p>Tuberculosis and Malaria
</p>
<p> 2. A &pound;10&nbsp; million seed fund to &ldquo;to improve the diagnosis, treatment and care of 
</p>
<p>infants and children living with HIV&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 3. To give grants to the Positive Action for Children Fund (PACF) and Positive 
</p>
<p>Action programmes to support a community response to the HIV epidemic
</p>
<p>Whilst GSK recognized that &ldquo;transferring the technology to produce drugs and 
</p>
<p>vaccines is one of the most sustainable ways to breach the access gap between the

</p>
<p>developed and developing world,&rdquo;24 it saw voluntary licenses as a &ldquo;specific response 
</p>
<p>to a particular set of circumstances&rdquo; rather than a universal solution.
</p>
<p>From 2010, the &lsquo;Access to medicines index&rsquo; ranked big pharma&rsquo;s performance 
</p>
<p>on sharing patents, pricing policies and developing medicine for neglected diseases 
</p>
<p>that affected the poor. This served to give big pharma an incentive to improve access 
</p>
<p>since it could be used as a benchmark to guide investor decisions and drew attention 
</p>
<p>to the notion of social responsibility.
</p>
<p>Founded in August 2010, the Developing Countries and Market Access (DCMA) 
</p>
<p>operating unit within GSK aimed &ldquo;to increase patient access to GSK medicines and 
</p>
<p>vaccines for around 800&nbsp;million people in least developed countries, while expand-
</p>
<p>ing our market presence and ensuring that our business continues to be sustainable.&rdquo;25 
</p>
<p>To achieve this, GSK adopted different pricing models in different countries based 
</p>
<p>on wealth26 and ability to pay. In developing countries it adopted a lower priced/
</p>
<p>higher volume approach and rewarded salespeople based on volume of medicines 
</p>
<p>delivered rather than sales targets. In middle-income countries it adopted flexible 
</p>
<p>and tiered pricing. In high-income countries, GSK offered support for low-income 
</p>
<p>patients, including pricing according to patient income, monthly payment plans and 
</p>
<p>discount cards. For vaccines, GSK offered tiered pricing.
</p>
<p>GSK recognised that while Africa&rsquo;s need for medicines was immense, it did not 
</p>
<p>have the means to pay for them. As Jon Pender, Vice President of Government 
</p>
<p>Affairs for GSK, explained &ldquo;Africa suffers 24% of the global disease burden, it has 
</p>
<p>3% of the world health workers and it has 1% of the world&rsquo;s health budget.&rdquo;27 In 
</p>
<p>April 2011, when GSK issued a statement detailing its policy on Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property &amp; Access to Medicines in Developing Countries, its commitments had 
</p>
<p>expanded to four:
</p>
<p> 1. Preferential pricing of our medicines and vaccines
</p>
<p> 2. Investing in (R&amp;D) that targets diseases particularly affecting the developing 
</p>
<p>world, including pursuing an open innovation strategy
</p>
<p> 3. Community investment activities and partnerships that foster effective 
</p>
<p>healthcare
</p>
<p> 4. Innovative partnerships and solutions, such as voluntary licensing
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GSK still did not accept the activists&rsquo; view of patents: &ldquo;It is mis-
</p>
<p>leading and counter-productive to focus on patents in the access debate. Patent pro-
</p>
<p>tection stimulates and fundamentally underpins the continued research and 
</p>
<p>development for new and better medicines for diseases including those which occur 
</p>
<p>in the developing world. Without adequate intellectual property protection, the med-
</p>
<p>icines that are needed in the developing world are far less likely to be developed.&rdquo;28

</p>
<p>It argued that &ldquo;Companies would not incur the risk and cost of innovative R&amp;D if, 
</p>
<p>shortly after launch of their products, a cheaper copy could be launched by a com-
</p>
<p>petitor who had the competitive advantage of not incurring developing costs and 
</p>
<p>risk and who did not develop the market for the product.&rdquo;29
</p>
<p>In 2012, the Financial Times30 noted: &ldquo;Global health programmes, in short, 
</p>
<p>reflect a mixture of philanthropy and self-interest, with recognition of the potential 
</p>
<p>for sales (in the developing world) and the need to maintain a good image a decade 
</p>
<p>after South Africa&rsquo;s legal action against the drug companies over the price of HIV 
</p>
<p>medicines did so much damage to the industry&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>India, a major producer of generic medicines, was dubbed &lsquo;the Third World&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>pharmacy&rsquo;. Contravening the 2005 TRIPS regulations and at odds with big pharma, 
</p>
<p>India supplied generic drugs31 to sub-Saharan Africa at prices much cheaper than 
</p>
<p>branded drugs. In 2012, when a controversial EU trade agreement with India sought 
</p>
<p>to stop these copycat medicines, opponents claimed the &ldquo;IP rules would serve the 
</p>
<p>interests of multinational pharmaceutical companies in Europe while drastically 
</p>
<p>increasing medicines prices for millions of poor people in India and other develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries.&ldquo;Trade treaties, they insisted, would force people in the developing 
</p>
<p>world to either buy the brand-name products at high prices or die. MSF research 
</p>
<p>found that companies restricted voluntary licences to LDCs and sub-Saharan 
</p>
<p>Africa32 and the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) was &ldquo;limited in its ability to convince 
</p>
<p>patent-holding companies to include developing countries which are at the forefront 
</p>
<p>of bearing the impact of the TRIPS agreement.&rdquo;33
</p>
<p>In April 2013, the Indian Supreme Court ruled against Novartis&rsquo;s intention to 
</p>
<p>overturn a law that allowed a popular patenting practice in the pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>industry known as &lsquo;evergreening,&rsquo; which entailed filing and then obtaining multiple 
</p>
<p>patents relating to different aspects of the same medicine. MSF welcomed the land-
</p>
<p>mark ruling: &ldquo;The Indian government will continue to be able to protect public 
</p>
<p>health against abusive patenting practices and unwarranted monopolies and keep 
</p>
<p>the door open as much as possible for access to affordable medicines for millions of 
</p>
<p>people in developing countries who rely on quality generics made in India.&rdquo;34
</p>
<p>By 2013, ViiV Healthcare had offered royalty-free voluntary licenses to 16 
</p>
<p>generic manufacturers to enable them to produce and sell low-cost versions of the 
</p>
<p>full range of GSK&rsquo;s ARV medicines for public sector and donor programmes.35

</p>
<p>training campaigns, including prevention of mother-to-child transmission.
</p>
<p>GSK used technology and innovations to improve access to its medicines for 
</p>
<p>people in LDCs, as well as to prevent counterfeiting of its medicine, such as reduced 
</p>
<p>pack sizes and liquid formulations of medicines for children. It partnered with 
</p>
<p>Vodafone to increase vaccination rates for children in Africa by ensuring that vac-
</p>
<p>cines were available when and where needed. Medicines sold in Nigeria included a 
</p>
<p>scratch-off panel with a unique code on the packaging so patients could send a free 
</p>
<p>SMS to check the quality and authenticity of the product.
</p>
<p>GSK outlined a number of responsible business commitments to address global 
</p>
<p>health needs as of 2012&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;health for all, our behaviour, our people and our planet&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>In its 2013 Corporate Responsibility Report, it reported on each area, including six 
</p>
<p>behavioural and 10 health commitments (see Exhibit 8.2). Its access policy seemed 
</p>
<p>to be producing results: between 2010 and 2013 GSK reported a 60% increase in the 
</p>
<p>volume of medicines supplied to least developed countries.36 Nevertheless, a study 
</p>
<p>it commissioned by the International Centre for Social Franchising in 2013 identi-
</p>
<p>fied a key problem: &ldquo;...for the most part, existing healthcare delivery models target 
</p>
<p>the more affluent emerging middle class, rather than the poorest.&rdquo;37
</p>
<p>From the beginning, donations were a key part of GSKs access strategy.38 In 
</p>
<p>2013, it donated &pound;221&nbsp;million for global community investments and &pound;146&nbsp;million 
</p>
<p>in medicines. It was particularly proud of its work in actively donating tablets to 
</p>
<p>support the WHO&rsquo;s 2020 goals to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) or &lsquo;elephantia-
</p>
<p>sis&rsquo;, a tropical disease caused by a parasitic worm, transmitted via mosquitoes, 
</p>
<p>where a person&rsquo;s arms, legs and genitalia swell to several times their normal size. 
</p>
<p>When the WHO/SmithKline partnership started out in 1997, &ldquo;more than 120&nbsp;mil-
</p>
<p>lion&rdquo; were said to be suffering from LF.&nbsp;By 2013, GSK claimed that its tablet dona-
</p>
<p>tions had reached over 600&nbsp; million people.39 Nevertheless, after 16&nbsp; years of 
</p>
<p>donations, there were still over 120&nbsp;million infected, and about 40&nbsp;million disfigured 
</p>
<p>and incapacitated by the disease.40
</p>
<p>GSK stated41 that it wanted &ldquo;to adapt our business model to improve the avail-
</p>
<p>ability and affordability of high quality products&rdquo; so that they could be made &ldquo;acces-
</p>
<p>sible to as many people who need them as possible.&rdquo; It increased the number of 
</p>
<p>pricing tiers for vaccines to seven, based on gross national income per capita 
</p>
<p>(reflecting ability to pay) an approach designed to support countries which commit-
</p>
<p>ted to vaccination for the long term.

In 2008, GSK valued its donations (calculated according to the industrialised retail price), in-cash 
social investments, and other charitable projects at &pound;124&nbsp;million.

</p>
<p>The supply of medicines was only part of the problem. GSK stated that &ldquo;We are 
</p>
<p>committed to improving access to our products &ndash;irrespective of where people live or 
</p>
<p>their ability to pay&ndash; by focusing on the affordability and availability of our products, 
</p>
<p>and investing in strengthening health systems.&rdquo; To ensure that people had access to 
</p>
<p>medicines and services, GSK recognised that it was necessary to train community 
</p>
<p>health workers and explore new healthcare delivery models to &ldquo;drive out inefficien-
</p>
<p>cies in the procurement, storage, prescribing and use of drugs.&rdquo;42GSK felt that this 
</p>
<p>was a &ldquo;shared responsibility between all sectors of national and global society, 
</p>
<p>including national governments, industrialised donor countries, NGOs, industry and 
</p>
<p>multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, WHO and UNAIDS.&rdquo;43
</p>
<p>Consequently, collaborations were an increasingly important component of 
</p>
<p>GSK&rsquo;s access strategy. GSK partnered with a number of government organisations 
</p>
<p>and NGOs, including the Global Alliance to Eliminate LF,44 the GAVI Alliance, the 
</p>
<p>Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB &amp; Malaria, Save the Children Fund, and the World 
</p>
<p>Health Development Organisation. In 2013, GSK committed US $750,000 to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations&rsquo; &lsquo;One million community health workers&rsquo; campaign45 which aimed 
</p>
<p>to put a million health workers in rural sub-Sahara Africa by 2015.
</p>
<p>The reason why we are engaged in these issues is because we think it is the right thing to do 
</p>
<p>for patients and because we think this is the right thing to do for business.46
</p>
<p> Research in&nbsp;GSK
</p>
<p>In 2013, GSK spent &pound;3.4&nbsp;billion on R&amp;D, of which &pound;496&nbsp;million was invested in 
</p>
<p>vaccine R&amp;D, with an estimated return of 13%. This was the most productive R&amp;D 
</p>
<p>year in GSK&rsquo;s history, with five new medicines approved, including a new treatment 
</p>
<p>for HIV (Tivicay, launched through ViiV Healthcare).
</p>
<p>GSK operated a large research facility in Spain dedicated to R&amp;D for diseases of 
</p>
<p>the developing world, where its drug development projects were said to be &ldquo;priori-
</p>
<p>tised by their socio-economic and public health benefits, rather than by their com-
</p>
<p>mercial returns.&rdquo;47 Within the facility, GSK created an &lsquo;Open Lab&rsquo; where independent 
</p>
<p>researchers could access resources and expertise to advance their own research proj-
</p>
<p>ects. It allowed external researchers to screen GSK&rsquo;s compound library to poten-
</p>
<p>tially identify treatments for neglected tropical diseases. By the end of 2013, 38 
</p>
<p>visiting scientists had used the Open Lab. GSK committed to help eliminate and 
</p>
<p>control 10 neglected tropical diseases affecting 1.4&nbsp;billion of the world&rsquo;s poorest

<p>people by the year 2020. It committed US$10&nbsp; million to the Global Health 
</p>
<p>Investment Fund to finance the development of medicines, vaccines and interven-
</p>
<p>tions for diseases that affected LDCs.
</p>
<p>GSK vaccine research was focused on overcoming the challenges encountered 
</p>
<p>during storage and transport (maintaining vaccines at an optimal temperature in 
</p>
<p>remote regions often resulted in wastage) and on developing vaccines against can-
</p>
<p>cer, HIV, malaria, tuberculosis and dengue fever. In 2013, GSK partnered with the 
</p>
<p>Bill and Melinda Gates foundation (BMGF) on a $1.8&nbsp; million effort to develop 
</p>
<p>heat-stable vaccines.
</p>
<p>GSK was the first pharmaceutical company to share its clinical trial results,48 and 
</p>
<p>shared its findings on 13,500 compounds which had a potential to inhibit the malaria 
</p>
<p>parasite and tuberculosis, including 180 that were particularly promising. The 
</p>
<p>malaria compound information was shared with 160 groups around the world, the 
</p>
<p>tuberculosis compounds with 10 research groups. In 2013, this access to data was 
</p>
<p>expanded to share its clinical study reports and anonymised patient data.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, opponents accused GSK of releasing material from its trials only 
</p>
<p>in response to specific requests, and of hiding behind patient confidentiality to pre-
</p>
<p>vent a clear view of trial data, counter to its stated concerns about transparency and 
</p>
<p>advancing research. As psychiatrist Dr. David Healy blogged, &ldquo;If those of us who 
</p>
<p>have been participants in trials thought some remote risk of a breach of privacy was 
</p>
<p>being used to prevent the disclosure of details that would save someone else&rsquo;s life 
</p>
<p>but threaten GSK&rdquo;s profits, most of us would likely be horrified.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Vaccines at GSK
</p>
<p>Back in 2007, GSK had surprised the world by announcing that it was working on 
</p>
<p>a combination vaccine called Globorix to protect children against diseases such as 
</p>
<p>meningitis A and C, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B.&nbsp; The vaccine cost GSK 
</p>
<p>$400&nbsp;million to develop. Designed specifically &ldquo;to meet a pressing public health 
</p>
<p>threat in Africa&rdquo;, GSK did not expect sales of Globorix to recoup the cost of 
</p>
<p>R&amp;D.&nbsp;Whilst M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res welcomed the news, an anonymous blogger 
</p>
<p>on the &ldquo;Science of the invisible&rdquo; blog asked whether Globorix would be &ldquo;a loss 
</p>
<p>leader&rdquo;, questioning whether GSK was responding to developing countries&rsquo; health-
</p>
<p>care challenges.
</p>
<p>GSK was the market leader in vaccines and produced more than 30 vaccines for 
</p>
<p>children and adults (see Exhibit 8.3). Vaccination prevented disease, death and dis-
</p>
<p>ability, and was thus one of the most cost-effective preventive measures. Yet vac-
</p>
<p>cines were not adequately reaching the developing world. In response, the Global 
</p>
<p>Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI),49 had been set up to ensure univer-
</p>
<p>sal access to vaccines and protection against life-threatening diseases. GSK part-

WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank as part of the &lsquo;Decade of Vaccines Collaboration&rsquo;

</p>
<p>nered with UNICEF, who purchased vaccines on behalf of the GAVI.&nbsp;As vaccines 
</p>
<p>were volume-dependent, this was a win-win&nbsp;&ndash; it increased production volumes as 
</p>
<p>GSK sold to more customers, lowered manufacturing costs and improved planning; 
</p>
<p>which allowed GSK to offer lower prices to GAVI.
</p>
<p>In 2011, GSK provided the rotavirus vaccine50 to GAVI at $2.50 per dose, and $5 
</p>
<p>to fully immunise a child&nbsp;&ndash; a 67% reduction on the lowest public price. When GSK 
</p>
<p>sold at these lower prices, it took precautionary measures such as monitoring for 
</p>
<p>unusual sales activity to ensure that low-cost vaccines were not used elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>Allan Pamba, Director of Public Engagement and Access Initiatives, explained 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can, of course, only go so far, but we believe that the potential benefit of low- 
</p>
<p>cost vaccines for people in developing countries outweighs the risk.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In 2013, 862&nbsp;million vaccine doses were delivered to 170 countries, and over 
</p>
<p>80% of vaccines sold were used in developing countries. GSK had contributed 
</p>
<p>15.8&nbsp;billion doses of the oral polio vaccine and committed to supply 500&nbsp;million 
</p>
<p>doses of vaccines to GAVI for use in developing countries.51 Nevertheless, WHO 
</p>
<p>estimated that 22&nbsp;million children in developing countries still had no access to life- 
</p>
<p>saving vaccines. GAVI estimated that only 5% of children in the world received all 
</p>
<p>11 essential vaccines. And whilst various vaccines against HIV were being devel-
</p>
<p>oped, none had proven effective.52
</p>
<p>GSK followed a three-pronged approach to malaria53:
</p>
<p> 1. Innovation of new malaria medicines and vaccines in partnership with the 
</p>
<p>Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV)
</p>
<p> 2. Through the Africa Malaria Partnership, GSK invested in preventative measures, 
</p>
<p>such as using bed nets and indoor spraying. (&pound;4&nbsp;million between 2001 and 2013).
</p>
<p> 3. Preferential pricing for antimalarial medicines in LDCs and sub-Saharan Africa
</p>
<p>Then in 2014, after 30&nbsp;years of research, GSK announced that a vaccine against 
</p>
<p>malaria &ndash;RTS,S&nbsp;&ndash; was ready to be launched in 2015.54 Dr. Joe Cohen, Vice-President 
</p>
<p>of R&amp;D Emerging Diseases, told the FT55: &ldquo;Data from a late-stage trial that is still 
</p>
<p>in progress suggest the candidate vaccine can almost halve the number of malaria 
</p>
<p>cases in children aged five to 17&nbsp;months, on top of reductions from bed nets and 
</p>
<p>other tools.&rdquo; In an interview with the WSJ,56 CEO Andrew Witty said &ldquo;When the

<p>develop58 and finance the vaccine, and committed to make it available for cost of

<p> Scandals at GSK
</p>
<p>A series of scandals at GSK caused people to question its motives. Criminal inves-
</p>
<p>tigations into allegations of bribing doctors and paying off competitors to stall com-
</p>
<p>petitive product releases undermined its claim that &ldquo;being a responsible business is 
</p>
<p>essential to our strategy, and how we deliver success is just as important as what we 
</p>
<p>achieve.&rdquo;59
</p>
<p>At the AGM in 2003, shareholders had voted against the remuneration report in 
</p>
<p>what was seen as &ldquo;the biggest shareholder revolt of its kind in UK corporate his-
</p>
<p>tory&rdquo;. They were particularly angry about an estimated $35.7&nbsp;million &ldquo;golden 
</p>
<p>parachute&rdquo; Garnier would receive if he lost his job, which drew media accusa-
</p>
<p>tions of corporate greed.
</p>
<p>In 2004, GSK was accused of compromising the safety of patients with its antide-
</p>
<p>pressant Paxil. It was discovered that GSK had failed to disclose the results of 
</p>
<p>numerous trials indicating that the drug increased the risk of teen suicides. Paxil 
</p>
<p>was subsequently banned for use by minors.60
</p>
<p>In October 2010, GSK was ordered to pay $96&nbsp;million to former employee Cheryl 
</p>
<p>Eckard for failing to address the serious manufacturing contamination problems 
</p>
<p>she reported at their Cidra plant in Puerto Rico in 2002, where breakdowns on 
</p>
<p>production lines meant that products were contaminated with bacteria, or mixed 
</p>
<p>up such that medicines produced were either too strong or too weak.61

<p>perks and bribes&rsquo;, such as yacht trips, massages and balloon rides, in return for 
</p>
<p>prescribing drugs.
</p>
<p>In 2013, GSK was accused of corruption, price-fixing and quality controls in China. 
</p>
<p>The Chinese police said GSK had transferred 3&nbsp;billion yuan ($489&nbsp;million) to 
</p>
<p>travel agencies and consultancies to bribe doctors to promote its products. GSK 
</p>
<p>described the allegations as &ldquo;shameful&rdquo;, agreed that some of its executives in 
</p>
<p>China appeared to have broken the law and consequently dismissed &ldquo;dozens of 
</p>
<p>employees&rdquo;, made changes to its sales incentive schemes, and stopped payments 
</p>
<p>to doctors for making speeches, and to healthcare professionals for attending 
</p>
<p>medical conferences.62
</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, even when GSK tried to do good, people questioned its 
</p>
<p>intentions. For example, when GSK and Save the Children formed a global partner-
</p>
<p>ship to help save a million children&rsquo;s lives in the world&rsquo;s poorest regions, Rageh 
</p>
<p>Omaar, reporting for ITV in Africa, commented:
</p>
<p>Global pharmaceutical companies have a long controversial record in developing countries, 
many wonder why things will be different now&hellip; Aid agencies and multinational corpora-
tions like Glaxo Smith Kline have the ability to come together to stop children dying need-
lessly from preventable diseases. But the question is what are the motives behind this 
partnership?63

<p> Access to&nbsp;Medicines in&nbsp;2014
</p>
<p>In 2014, 2&nbsp;billion people still lacked adequate access to medicines to stay healthy.

<p>And with insufficient understanding of health issues an estimated 10&nbsp;million prema-
</p>
<p>ture deaths occurred.64 Under-five mortality was greatest in sub-Saharan Africa (fol-
</p>

</p>
<p>out of reach so that more affordable generic versions can be made.&rdquo; Rohit Malpani,

</p>
<p>spokesman for Oxfam USA, argued that &ldquo;ultimately, for least developed countries 
</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only generic competition that&rsquo;s going to get prices down to an affordable level.&rdquo;65
</p>
<p>HIV had moved from being the key issue to just one of a number of health prob-
</p>
<p>lems including vaccines, tuberculosis, malaria, neonatal, tropical diseases and pneu-
</p>
<p>monia (see Exhibit 8.4). The difference in death rates from non-communicable 
</p>
<p>diseases (NCDs) and other diseases between the developed and developing world 
</p>
<p>was stark. While the developing world had addressed the problems of AIDS and 
</p>
<p>people with HIV were living longer, the burden of chronic NCDs was heavier. 
</p>
<p>Breast cancer, cardio-vascular disease and smoking-, alcohol- and obesity-related 
</p>
<p>conditions were also affecting people in low-income countries. The WHO estimated 
</p>
<p>that the number of deaths from chronic NCDs was more than four times those from 
</p>
<p>AIDS, TB and malaria in low and middle-income countries. It claimed that with the 
</p>
<p>right access to medicines, around 8&nbsp;million NCD deaths could be prevented each 
</p>
<p>year in the developing world.66 NCDs now presented the same sort of major health 
</p>
<p>challenges and global burden that AIDS once had. But while AIDS was now ade-
</p>
<p>quately financed and widely understood, awareness of chronic NCDs and the oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities for health impact in LDCs were not.
</p>
<p>By 2014, many developing countries were seeking to move towards universal 
</p>
<p>health insurance coverage as advocated by the WHO, but only Ghana, Rwanda, 
</p>
<p>Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa had any formal structure for health insurance. 
</p>
<p>What worked elsewhere didn&rsquo;t work in much of Africa. The challenge was not just 
</p>
<p>about making medicines more affordable but more available. Several interconnected 
</p>
<p>factors determined whether patients received the right medicine at the right place 
</p>
<p>and time, including diagnosis and care, remaining in care, lack of healthcare work-
</p>
<p>ers, infrastructure investment, individual lifestyles, education and environment. The 
</p>
<p>cost of treatment was not just the price of the drugs but the cost of transport and of 
</p>
<p>time taken off work for patients&nbsp; &ndash; often to walk long distances and queue for 
</p>
<p>treatment.

<p> GSK and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Novartis Deal
</p>
<p>By 2014, GSK was the fourth largest global pharmaceutical company (see Exhibit 
</p>
<p>8.3). It had manufacturing sites in 86 countries and a commercial presence in 150 
</p>
<p>markets. Turnover was &pound;26.5&nbsp;billion, consisting of pharmaceuticals (67% of group 
</p>
<p>turnover, including medicines for cancer, heart disease and viral infections such as 
</p>
<p>HIV), vaccines (13% of group turnover) and consumer healthcare products.
</p>
<p>GSK was proud to have held the number one position on the Access to Medicines 
</p>
<p>Index from its conception. Shareholder returns also appeared to be high on manage-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo;s agenda: in 2014 the dividend was increased by 6%. In a video released in

</p>
<p>April 2014,67 Philip Thomson, SVP of Communications and Government Affairs, 
</p>
<p>said healthcare was -
</p>
<p>an area which fundamentally requires responsibility. It is something that the company takes 
</p>
<p>very seriously. At the core of the company is innovation and access, and the two are intrinsi-
</p>
<p>cally linked. What it should tell you is that we don&rsquo;t see any difference between our com-
</p>
<p>mercial success, our shareholder return, and our responsibility and the contribution we 
</p>
<p>should make to society.
</p>
<p>On 22 April 2014, GSK announced the terms of a complex three-part $20&nbsp;billion 
</p>
<p>restructuring deal with Swiss pharmaceutical Novartis68:
</p>
<p> 1. GSK would sell its portfolio of cancer drugs to Novartis for up to $16&nbsp;billion; 
</p>
<p>($1.5&nbsp;billion in milestone payments subject to drug trial successes)
</p>
<p> 2. GSK would buy Novartis&rsquo;s vaccines unit for up to $7.1&nbsp;billion ($5.25 bn plus a 
</p>
<p>potential $1.8bn in milestone payments subject to vaccine successes.)69 This 
</p>
<p>would give GSK 29% of the global vaccine market. &ldquo;GSK&rsquo;s late-stage develop-
</p>
<p>ment pipeline would be further strengthened with the addition of four new can-
</p>
<p>didate vaccines from Novartis.&rdquo; The new business would have more than 20 
</p>
<p>different vaccines in development, including assets to prevent hospital and 
</p>
<p>maternal infections and diseases prevalent in developing countries such as 
</p>
<p>malaria and tuberculosis.
</p>
<p> 3. Novartis and GSK would combine their consumer health businesses in a joint 
</p>
<p>venture, with 2013 pro forma revenues of &pound;6.5&nbsp;billion and GSK holding 63.5% 
</p>
<p>of shares and 7 out of 11 seats on the board
</p>
<p>Announcing the agreement, Andrew Witty, GSK chief executive, stated70:
</p>
<p>Opportunities to build greater scale and combine high quality assets in vaccines and con-
</p>
<p>sumer healthcare are scarce. With this transaction we will substantially strengthen two of 
</p>
<p>our core businesses and create significant new options to increase value for shareholders&hellip;. 
</p>
<p>The acquisition of Novartis&rsquo; vaccines business will significantly enhance the breadth of our 
</p>
<p>vaccines portfolio and pipeline, notably in meningitis, with the addition of Bexsero, an 
</p>
<p>exciting new vaccine for prevention of meningitis B.&nbsp;The acquisition will also strengthen 
</p>
<p>our manufacturing network and reduce supply costs&hellip;
</p>
<p>Finally, and very importantly, this transaction strengthens GSK&rsquo;s offering to patients 
</p>
<p>and consumers. We will expand our portfolio to both help treat illness and prevent disease, 
</p>
<p>and we will broaden our scope to improve human health with the acquired R&amp;D and inno-
</p>
<p>vation expertise.

</p>
<p>The deal would increase annual turnover to &pound;26.9&nbsp;billion and allow GSK to focus 
</p>
<p>on four key business areas&nbsp;&ndash; HIV, vaccines, respiratory conditions and consumer 
</p>
<p>healthcare.71 It was perceived as a win-win deal, driving sustainable sales growth, 
</p>
<p>allowing overheads to be spread over a bigger portfolio, and the companies to 
</p>
<p>become more efficient and more productive in the long term. In the financial media 
</p>
<p>it was perceived to benefit everyone: the companies could improve their long-term 
</p>
<p>earnings, allowing shareholders to earn increasing returns, while patients would 
</p>
<p>receive new drugs quicker through a speedier R&amp;D process. As the FT72 explained:
</p>
<p>Both companies get to specialise and focus resources on areas they are good at. To para-
</p>
<p>phrase Novartis&rsquo; chief executive, Novartis can get more value out of Glaxo&rsquo;s cancer labs 
</p>
<p>than Glaxo can, while Glaxo can make Novartis&rsquo; vaccines business work harder. If it works, 
</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s a winner. Consumers get more new drugs, more quickly. Shareholders and man-
</p>
<p>agement avoid the indigestion problems that always come with any big merger. And nobody 
</p>
<p>has to shell out ridiculous fees to investment banks to broker the whole thing.

<p>Exhibit 8.1: Oxfam&rsquo;s Assessment Criteria for Access to Medicines
</p>
<p>Expected behaviour in each of Oxfam&rsquo;s three assessment areas of a pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>company that has reached the top &lsquo;civil stage&rsquo; &ndash; when it actively pushes other com-
</p>
<p>panies and stakeholders within the sector to raise standards as an industry.
</p>
<p>Research and Development
</p>
<p> 1. The company supports and participates in joint private-public initiatives (JPPIs) 
</p>
<p>that address R&amp;D, or conducts Its own in-house research For infectious diseases: 
</p>
<p>collaborates with third parties (e.g. JPPIs, generic companies) working on R&amp;D 
</p>
<p>for medicines to treat neglected and abandoned diseases; and facilitates access to 
</p>
<p>Its compound library for other relevant parties to conduct R&amp;D for neglected and 
</p>
<p>abandoned diseases.
</p>
<p> 2. Companies conduct R&amp;D for diseases prevalent in developing countries as an 
</p>
<p>integral part of their overall R&amp;D strategy. This strategy should have specific 
</p>
<p>targets to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of commitments made by 
</p>
<p>companies.
</p>
<p> 3. The company invests in paediatric versions and versions adapted to resource- 
</p>
<p>poor settings, including heat-resistant formulations.
</p>
<p>Pricing Strategy
</p>
<p> 1. The company applies a systematic, global approach to pricing in developing 
</p>
<p>countries, overseen by an international public-health body, which addresses 
</p>
<p>public- health needs and real purchasing power for each country.
</p>
<p>71 These revenues would be split across Pharmaceuticals 62%, Consumer Healthcare 24%, and 
Vaccines 14%, (FT 22/04/2014: Novartis buys GSK business for up to $16bn http://www.ft.com/

</p>
<p> 2. The company discloses its pricing rationale in developing countries.
</p>
<p> 3. The company&rsquo;s pricing policy ensures that products for neglected diseases devel-
</p>
<p>oped as part of a JPPI or developed in-house, are affordable for developing 
</p>
<p>countries.
</p>
<p> 4. The company applies the above pricing policies to its entire portfolio beyond 
</p>
<p>neglected diseases and HIV and AIDS, and in all developing countries.
</p>
<p>Intellectual Property
</p>
<p> 1. The company does not lobby developed-country or developing-country govern-
</p>
<p>ments or pursue legal avenues to impose or enforce patent rules that exceed mini-
</p>
<p>mum obligations under the TRIPS Agreement, or that weaken the use of 
</p>
<p>public-health safeguards. The company should publicly accept the use of TRIPS 
</p>
<p>safeguards and flexibilities.
</p>
<p> 2. The company supports lifting TRIPS-related restrictions on the export of generic 
</p>
<p>versions of patented medicines to least-developed countries and to developing 
</p>
<p>countries that have insufficient or no manufacturing capacity, in line with the 
</p>
<p>Doha Declaration. The company supports extending the non-implementation of 
</p>
<p>patent rules for pharmaceuticals in LDCs beyond 2016.
</p>
<p> 3. The company does not apply for patents for the purpose of &lsquo;ever-greening&rsquo; exist-
</p>
<p>ing medicines, i.e. the extension of pharmaceutical monopolies beyond the ini-
</p>
<p>tial 20-year term. Therefore, companies should not seek patents for new 
</p>
<p>indications of existing medicines, new formulations, or combinations of existing 
</p>
<p>medicines, nor should they seek patents for modifications of existing chemical 
</p>
<p>entities or pharmaceuticals unless these changes are novel, show an innovative 
</p>
<p>step, and have significant therapeutic advantages.
</p>
<p> 4. The company extends the relevant intellectual property policies to all medicines 
</p>
<p>in its portfolio, and does not limit its policies only to medicines needed to treat 
</p>
<p>HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.
</p>
<p> 5. The company renounces all patent rights on medicines developed for infectious 
</p>
<p>diseases under JPPIs in developing countries.
</p>
<p> 6. The company follows Oxfam&rsquo;s best-practice guidelines when issuing voluntary 
</p>
<p>licences (VLs).

</p>
<p>Exhibit 8.3: The Pharmaceutical Market and Research Process
</p>
<p>The global pharmaceutical market grew from $220&nbsp;billion in 1999 to $808&nbsp;billion in 
</p>
<p>2013,73 with the Americas accounting for 44% of sales and an estimated 60% of 
</p>
<p>industry profits. Only 1.4% of sales value came from the combined Middle East and 
</p>
<p>Africa.
</p>
<p>In 2013, with 2.8% of the global market, GSK was the fourth largest pharmaceu-
</p>
<p>tical company after Pfizer (7.5%), Merck (5.3%) and AstraZeneca (4.4%).74 The 
</p>
<p>industry was highly competitive but one of the most profitable. GSK had a profit 
</p>
<p>margin of 20.5% (Pfizer&rsquo;s was 42.7%, Merck&rsquo;s 10.0%, and AstraZeneca&rsquo;s 10.0%).75
</p>
<p>The global vaccine market, which represented 3.4% of the total global pharma-
</p>
<p>ceutical market76, grew by approximately 10% per&nbsp;annum. GSK was the leading 
</p>
<p>producer with 23% of the market, followed by Sanofi (20%), Merck (14%), Pfizer 
</p>
<p>(13%) and Novartis (10%).77
</p>
<p>The costs of research, legal and regulatory constraints (to ensure the safety and 
</p>
<p>efficacy of medicines) and patents restricted new entrants. Prices came under pres-
</p>
<p>sure as governments sought to reduce the financial burden of health systems, 
</p>
<p>prompting investor concern that the industry might not deliver the profits they were 
</p>
<p>used to. Moreover, research took years, with only a small chance of a positive out-
</p>
<p>come.78 The research process entailed laboratory research, product development, 
</p>
<p>animal experiments, and clinical trials with patient volunteers to prove the efficacy 
</p>
<p>of the drug prior to obtaining regulatory approval, and marketing. According to the 
</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America trade group (PhRMA), out 
</p>
<p>of 5000&ndash;10,000 screened compounds, only 250 entered preclinical testing, of which 
</p>
<p>only five entered human clinical trials and only one would be approved. By 2012, 
</p>
<p>some commentators79 estimated that the full cost of bringing a new medicine to 
</p>
<p>market had reached $1.5&nbsp;billion.
</p>
<p>The industry&rsquo;s business model was based on finding &lsquo;blockbuster&rsquo; drugs and then 
</p>
<p>protecting them by the patent system. A patent gave exclusive rights to supply the 
</p>
<p>product in the country where it was granted, essentially ensuring a monopoly for 
</p>
<p>20&nbsp;years, during which profits would help recoup the high cost of R&amp;D.&nbsp;Multiple 
</p>
<p>patents were involved, including patents for the compound, process and formulation 
</p>
<p>(i.e. type of dose). Patent holders could grant voluntary licenses to other manufac-
</p>
<p>turers to make or sell generic versions of their medicine within the boundaries of 
</p>
<p>stated countries, in return for a royalty on these sales.

</p>
<p>Once the patent had expired, other manufacturers could produce and market the 
</p>
<p>same medicine under a generic name. With no R&amp;D to cover and manufacturing 
</p>
<p>costs low, they could offer generic medicines at much lower prices. For example, the 
</p>
<p>arrival of generic competition to GSKs dermatology products saw its sales decline 
</p>
<p>58% to &pound;13&nbsp;million. Patent expiry was therefore a major concern. In search of a new 
</p>
<p>business model, the pharmaceutical industry saw &lsquo;a splurge of multibillion-dollar

</p>
<p>Because profitability in low and middle-income countries was small, big pharma 
</p>
<p>had little incentive to develop medicines for those markets&nbsp;&ndash; what were significant 
</p>
<p>threats to health in the developing world were of negligible market size elsewhere, 
</p>
<p>such as HIV-positive mothers and children. The generic manufacturers did not have 
</p>
<p>the resources to carry out clinical trials to develop these medicines. In 2012, more than 
</p>
<p>90% of people receiving ARV treatment lived in low and middle-income countries, a 
</p>
<p>market estimated to be worth $1.5&nbsp;billion (less than 10% of the value of the global 
</p>
<p>market). The paediatric market accounted for 7% of the total ARV market and was 
</p>
<p>confined to low and middle-income countries (childhood HIV having been almost 
</p>
<p>eliminated elsewhere).81 Once generic manufacturers had entered the ARV market, 
</p>
<p>big pharma left them to supply this unprofitable segment. By 2012 they were supply-
</p>
<p>ing over 95% of first line ARV medicines in low and middle-income countries.82

<p>Exhibit 8.4: Key Diseases Affecting the Developing World
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, there was a 20-year life expectancy gap 
</p>
<p>between the developed and developing world. A disproportionate volume of research 
</p>
<p>focused on health in developed countries to the neglect of those in LDCs.83
</p>
<p>Over the years, HIV/AIDS had received a lot of media attention, finance and 
</p>
<p>concerted efforts from NGOs such as Christian Aid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stop the AIDS&rsquo; campaign 
</p>
<p>and the annual &lsquo;World AID&rsquo;S day&rsquo;. By 2014, billions of dollars had been commit-
</p>
<p>ted to global funds to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, and millions of people were on 
</p>
<p>ARV drugs in low and middle-income countries.84 The scale-up in ARV treatment 
</p>
<p>had been impressive, from 0.8&nbsp; million people in sub-Sahara Africa in 2005 to 
</p>
<p>3.9&nbsp; million in 2009. The price of first and second-line ARVs to treat HIV had 
</p>
<p>dropped because of increased competition among generic producers. First-line

<p>ARVs had fallen from $10,000&nbsp;in the early years, to around $14085 per person per 
</p>
<p>year, and medicines used in second-line combination treatment86 had fallen from 
</p>
<p>$700&nbsp;in 200887 to around $300 per year.88
</p>
<p>The threat of AIDS drastically diminished through a combination of prevention 
</p>
<p>and treatment. AIDS-related deaths peaked in 2005. Globally, new HIV infections 
</p>
<p>had peaked in 1997 and continued to decline. In 2012, an estimated 9.7&nbsp;million 
</p>
<p>people89in low and middle-income countries obtained ARV therapy and the UN goal 
</p>
<p>of having 15&nbsp;million people in treatment worldwide by 2015 appeared reachable. 
</p>
<p>Although 34&nbsp;million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2014,90 AIDS was 
</p>
<p>no longer perceived as a pandemic. Drugs had transformed AIDS from a death sen-
</p>
<p>tence to a chronic disease: a person infected with HIV at age 25 could expect to live 
</p>
<p>into their 70s.91 Drugs were available for HIV-positive pregnant women, which 
</p>
<p>eliminated the transmission of AIDS to babies and led to enormous reductions in the 
</p>
<p>number of children with HIV.92 Progress towards the goals of &lsquo;zero new infections&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>and an &lsquo;AIDS-free generation&rsquo; prompted UNAIDS to announce &ldquo;today we have the 
</p>
<p>tools we need to lay the groundwork to end the AIDS epidemic.&rdquo;93
</p>
<p>However, since AIDS still was a life-long condition, millions in the developing 
</p>
<p>world would require years of sustained HIV drug treatment. Yet access to treatment 
</p>
<p>varied considerably within and between countries: 3.4&nbsp;million children were living 
</p>
<p>with HIV and without treatment, 33% of HIV-infected infants would die before the 
</p>
<p>age of one, 50% by 2&nbsp;years old.94 Only 10 of the 29 ARV medicines available in 
</p>
<p>2013 were approved for use with children. Because of difficulties supplying the 
</p>
<p>liquid formulation required by infants and smaller batch sizes, they tended to be 
</p>
<p>higher priced than adult formulations.95

</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, where 25&nbsp;million lived with HIV,96 approximately three 
</p>
<p>quarters of adults had not achieved viral suppression as a result of shortfalls at each 
</p>
<p>stage of the treatment cascade.97 In 2014, 1.6&nbsp;million HIV-related deaths occurred in 
</p>
<p>Africa,98 where more than 90% of mother-to-child transmission occurred, and only 
</p>
<p>65% of pregnant women with HIV received treatment.
</p>
<p>The earlier ART treatment was initiated, the greater its benefits. But a report 
</p>
<p>published by UNAIDS, the WHO and UNICEF in June 2013 noted that &ldquo;structural, 
</p>
<p>operational, logistical and social barriers, including stigma, discrimination, and 
</p>
<p>punitive laws and policies&rdquo; hindered access to HIV testing or resulted in patient 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;loss&rsquo; between testing and starting treatment. WHO guidelines on HIV treatment99 
</p>
<p>in 2013 indicated that 28.6&nbsp; million were eligible for ARV therapy in low- and 
</p>
<p>middle- income countries and that substantially faster scale-up was needed.
</p>
<p>Moreover, there was a problem of resistance to AIDS drugs over time. UNITAID 
</p>
<p>reported increased cases of resistance from 4.8% in 2007 to 6.8% in 2010&nbsp;in low and 
</p>
<p>middle-income countries.100 As patients developed resistance to second-line ARVs, 
</p>
<p>they needed to switch to a new generation of HIV drugs. According to the WHO, 
</p>
<p>3.6% of adult patients were on second-line treatments in 2012; 3% of patients on 
</p>
<p>first-line ARVs needed to switch to second-line regimens annually. However, the 
</p>
<p>minimum cost of these medicines in the poorest countries was $2000 per year.101 In 
</p>
<p>conformity with TRIPS regulations, medicines developed after 2005 could no lon-
</p>
<p>ger become generics. NGOs warned that if resistance to generic drugs continued, 
</p>
<p>death rates would return to the levels of the 1980s. Would history repeat itself, with 
</p>
<p>access to HIV treatment again subject to the ability to pay?
</p>
<p>Tuberculosis accounted for 1.3&nbsp;million deaths in 2012 and a quarter of its victims 
</p>
<p>were HIV-positive. Even with medicines and the preventive use of bednets, malaria 
</p>
<p>was responsible for over half a million deaths globally every year. Christian Aid 
</p>
<p>noted that &ldquo;Most shockingly, despite the fact that malaria is both a preventable and 
</p>
<p>curable disease, most of those deaths occur among African children.&rdquo;102 The eco-
</p>
<p>nomic cost of malaria was high, consuming &ldquo;around 40% of all public health

<p>9Revenue Flow and Human Rights: The Paradoxes of Shell in Nigeria
Aileen M. Ionescu-Somers
</p>
<p>A Nigerian &ldquo;can of worms&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In February 2013, Alan Detheridge, former British vice president of Shell&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>External Affairs wrote an article for the reputable British broadsheet newspaper, 
</p>
<p>The Guardian.1 In it, he wrote:
</p>
<p>Oil companies can bring great wealth to the countries where they operate. The revenues 
from the industry have the potential to drive economic growth and be a powerful force in 
reducing poverty. However, in some resource-rich countries, these revenue flows are vul-
nerable to corruption and mismanagement, with little benefit going to the population at 
large.
</p>
<p>Detheridge continued to point out the importance of transparency to tackle the 
</p>
<p>threats of corruption and mismanagement, but also to press for oil companies, 
</p>
<p>including his former employer, not to push for exemptions or oppose full and com-
</p>
<p>prehensive transparency on monetary flows from extractive industry activities. He 
</p>
<p>had good reason, based on long experience, to advocate for more transparency, not 
</p>
<p>less.
</p>
<p>When they retired around the same time in September 2006, Detheridge and 
</p>
<p>Joshua Udofia, his senior Nigerian corporate advisor had managed issues in the 
</p>
<p>Niger Delta during some of Shell&rsquo;s most challenging years. Their careers with Shell 
</p>
<p>had both been long: 29 and 35&nbsp;years respectively. They had seen it all, from NGOs 
</p>
<p>pointing the finger at the environmental and social impacts of oil spills and gas flar-
</p>
<p>ing, to extensive media coverage of human rights issues that had occurred after the 
</p>
<p>much-publicized Ken Saro-Wiwa execution in 1995. But by the end of 2006, both 
</p>
<p>men would be retiring. In the run-up to retirement, they often found themselves

</p>
<p>discussing what the future would hold for their successors, and whether Shell&rsquo;s cur-
</p>
<p>rent strategies were likely to lead to successful outcomes. Detheridge and Udofia 
</p>
<p>had long agreed that poverty was at the root of the problems of both Nigeria and the 
</p>
<p>oil-bearing Niger Delta region. During their tenure, Shell had made significant 
</p>
<p>changes in its approach to its community development program, including partner-
</p>
<p>ing with NGOs and development agencies. But NGOs remained generally unim-
</p>
<p>pressed. Even if such programs delivered to its full potential, they knew that they 
</p>
<p>alone could not improve the quality of life for most of the Niger Delta&rsquo;s 27 million 
</p>
<p>inhabitants.
</p>
<p>A fundamental problem was related to oil revenue flow. The corruption that was 
</p>
<p>endemic to Nigeria was a serious impediment to desperately needed development. 
</p>
<p>In addition, state politicians were enmeshed with war lords for the sake of political 
</p>
<p>and personal gain and a new generation of more unpredictable militias had intensi-
</p>
<p>fied hostage taking involving oil company staff. The Nigerian president&rsquo;s anti- 
</p>
<p>corruption support had been encouraging but expected elections in 2007 might 
</p>
<p>mean that efforts thus far would be jeopardized. The paradox was&hellip;no matter what 
</p>
<p>Shell did, no matter how much money it ploughed into community development and 
</p>
<p>programs, if revenue transparency was not sorted out, could attitudes change and 
</p>
<p>life be improved for people in the Delta? But had Shell gone as far as it could to 
</p>
<p>alleviate the human rights crisis in the Delta? Many of the international NGOs did 
</p>
<p>not think so.
</p>
<p> Shell and Nigeria
</p>
<p>Royal Dutch was founded in 1890&nbsp;in the Netherlands by Aeilko Jans Zijlker who 
</p>
<p>first discovered oil in the Dutch East Indies. The Shell Transport and Trading 
</p>
<p>Company was a British company founded in 1897 by the Samuel brothers. In 1907 
</p>
<p>the two companies merged and it was agreed that Royal Dutch would handle oil 
</p>
<p>refining and production operations and Shell would deal with the transport, storage 
</p>
<p>and marketing of the oil products. The two companies were separately traded hold-
</p>
<p>ing companies owning 60% and 40% respectively of Royal Dutch/Shell Group&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>operating subsidiaries. In November 2004 the Shell Group moved to a single parent 
</p>
<p>company, Royal Dutch Shell plc, (Shell) with headquarters in the Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>Unification was completed on 20 July 2005. Shell was an impressive success story. 
</p>
<p>By 2005, its revenues reached $306 billion with profits of $25 billion, maintaining 
</p>
<p>its position as one of the world&rsquo;s top three private oil companies. Shell was a veri-
</p>
<p>table &ldquo;super major&rdquo; with 112,000 employees operating in over 140 companies 
</p>
<p>worldwide.
</p>
<p>In 1937 Shell was authorized to prospect for oil in Nigeria during British colo-
</p>
<p>nial rule in equal partnership with British Petroleum (BP). Oil was discovered in the 
</p>
<p>Niger Delta in 1958. On October 1, 1960 Nigeria gained independence. Its leaders 
</p>
<p>faced the daunting task of holding 250 ethnic groups together as a nation. They 
</p>
<p>organized a loose federation of self-governing states, each one with a large degree 
</p>
<p>of constitutional autonomy. In 1973, following a period of civil war, military coups 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>and turbulence, the two-way partnership with Shell and BP gave way to a joint ven-
</p>
<p>ture with the Nigerian government. The Shell Petroleum Development Company of 
</p>
<p>Nigeria Limited (SPDC) held Shell&rsquo;s share. By 2006, SPDC was the principle oper-
</p>
<p>ator of Nigeria&rsquo;s largest oil and gas joint venture (Nigerian National Petroleum 
</p>
<p>Company 55%, SPDC 30%, Total 10% and Agip 5%), producing approximately 
</p>
<p>40% of Nigeria&rsquo;s oil from over 1000 wells in the Delta.
</p>
<p>By the 1980s, Nigeria had become an African success story, with the 33rd high-
</p>
<p>est per capita income in the world. However, subsequent undemocratic military 
</p>
<p>regimes, corruption and governmental inefficiency took their toll, together with a 
</p>
<p>3% per&nbsp;annum population growth. By 1997, the country was ranked the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>13th poorest country. With the dawn of the new millennium, despite being the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s sixth largest exporter of petroleum, 66% of its 131 million population lived 
</p>
<p>on less than $1 per day. In 2005 the NGO Transparency International classed Nigeria 
</p>
<p>as the sixth most corrupt country in the world (Shell had more trouble with corrupt 
</p>
<p>employees than in any other country, sacking several staff and delisting a certain 
</p>
<p>number of contractors every year in line with its business principles). The UN 
</p>
<p>ranked Nigeria amongst the world&rsquo;s top twenty &ldquo;most unlivable countries,&rdquo; and per 
</p>
<p>capita GNI was still only at a level of $400.
</p>
<p>In 1999 General Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military ruler of Nigeria, was 
</p>
<p>democratically elected. Initially, Obasanjo was revered for his commitment to 
</p>
<p>democracy and fighting corruption (before becoming president, he was the Chairman 
</p>
<p>of Transparency International&rsquo;s International Advisory Group). The first legislation 
</p>
<p>Obasanjo put forward as elected president was a corrupt practices bill. He led a 
</p>
<p>drive to recuperate billions stolen during a previous military regime. In spite of 
</p>
<p>these efforts anti-corruption officials estimated in 2005 that 45% of Nigeria&rsquo;s oil 
</p>
<p>revenues were being siphoned away yearly.
</p>
<p>In 2000 a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to stipulate a method for the 
</p>
<p>sharing of oil revenues was signed between the government and the major oil com-
</p>
<p>panies working in the Delta. The MOU hedged the multinationals for risk when oil 
</p>
<p>prices were low rather than enabling them to benefit when prices were high. Joint 
</p>
<p>venture partners including SPDC would receive a fixed margin as long as the oil 
</p>
<p>price ranged from $15 to $19 a barrel. At higher oil prices, the Government share of 
</p>
<p>the profit would gradually increase to 95% (refer to Exhibit 1 for the split of the 
</p>
<p>barrel between partners and government within a range of oil prices) (Fig.&nbsp;9.1).
</p>
<p>By 2006, some 2.5 million barrels of Nigerian oil per day were being pumped, 
</p>
<p>including onshore and offshore operations (3% of global oil production). Crude oil 
</p>
<p>prices on the world market reached an all-time high of $72.35 a barrel in April 2006, 
</p>
<p>giving the Nigerian government record revenues. SPDC paid $4.3 billion in petro-
</p>
<p>leum profit taxes and royalties to the federal government in 2005, representing a 
</p>
<p>considerable increase on the $2.2 billion paid in 2003. By 2006, petroleum accounted 
</p>
<p>for more than 80% of government revenues, 90% of foreign exchange earnings, 
</p>
<p>95% of export receipts and 40% of gross domestic product.

<p> Human Rights in the Niger Delta
</p>
<p>Oil majors in Nigeria operated in an extremely difficult economic and political envi-
</p>
<p>ronment, both nationally and locally. Detheridge pointed to the complexity:
</p>
<p>The more I know about Nigeria, the more I realize just how little I know. Some humility is 
not only sensible, but essential. As a Nigerian, my colleague Joshua Udofia knows more 
than we will ever know.
</p>
<p>The Delta was a densely populated region that had been a major producer of 
</p>
<p>palm oil in colonial times, ironically earning itself the name of &ldquo;oil rivers&rdquo; because 
</p>
<p>of this agricultural heritage. The area was an extensive network of swamps and 
</p>
<p>creeks over some 70,000&nbsp;km (7.5% of Nigeria&rsquo;s total land mass). It included land 
</p>
<p>from nine states (refer to Fig.&nbsp;9.2 for a map of the area), of which four&nbsp;&ndash; Akwa Ibom, 
</p>
<p>Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers&nbsp;&ndash; were the major oil producers. Of the 131 million popu-
</p>
<p>lation of Nigeria, some 20 million people (from over 40 ethnic groups) lived in the 
</p>
<p>Delta. The primary activities of local people were fishing and farming.
</p>
<p>As required under the constitution, the Nigerian government returned a signifi-
</p>
<p>cant proportion of the federal revenues it received to state governments (31.1%) and 
</p>
<p>local government areas (15.2%) In addition, 13% of its revenues from oil and gas 
</p>
<p>was returned to the states where production took place. But over a prolonged period, 
</p>
<p>human rights groups claimed that various governments had either misspent or 
</p>
<p>siphoned off into foreign bank accounts the very funds that should have gone back 
</p>
<p>to develop the communities of the oil producing areas.
</p>
<p>Politics has become an exercise in organized corruption (&hellip;.) large commissions and per-
centage cuts of contracts have enabled individual soldiers and politicians to amass huge 
fortunes.2

</p>
<p>It was a constant battle for companies to get successive governments to fund their 
</p>
<p>agreed contribution to the joint ventures. It was also self-evident that oil revenues 
</p>
<p>received by the government were not reaching the people that needed it most:
</p>
<p>Though the government is a 55&ndash;60% shareholder in oil operations and earns billions in 
royalties each year, local infrastructure at the source of these billions is in shambles, food 
shortages abound, malnutrition is common among Niger Delta children, power blackouts 
regularly occur, and roads are usually in terrible condition.3
</p>
<p>Rising community resentment at the lack of improvement to quality of life in 
</p>
<p>spite of rich resources gradually gave way to active protests against oil company 
</p>
<p>activities&nbsp;&ndash; since protests to government had proved unfruitful. Hostage taking, clo-
</p>
<p>sures of flow stations, intimidation of staff and even sabotage of oil installations 
</p>
<p>became endemic in the Delta states as resentment increased.
</p>
<p>During the 1990s, Shell came under immense pressure because of specific human 
</p>
<p>rights issues. Confrontations between indigenous populations and Nigerian govern-
</p>
<p>ment security forces over human rights regularly occurred. In 1990, when an ini-
</p>
<p>tially peaceful protest in Umuechem in Rivers State turned violent, Shell requested 
</p>
<p>police protection. The police were attacked by the protestors, resulting in the death 
</p>
<p>of a policeman, which in turn led to a large number of people being killed by the 
</p>
<p>police and homes being destroyed. In 1994 the military sent security forces into 
</p>
<p>Ogoniland in the southern part of the Delta where a movement for recognition of 
</p>
<p>rights for the indigenous Ogoni people was growing. Ogoniland (with a population

</p>
<p>of 500,000) was home to the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, a charismatic, outspoken 
</p>
<p>human rights campaigner, who ultimately became leader of the Movement for the 
</p>
<p>Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP). In 1990 MOSOP issued a bill of rights that 
</p>
<p>demanded political autonomy for the Ogoni people, a fair share of the proceeds of 
</p>
<p>oil extraction and the right to protect the Ogoni environment and ecology from fur-
</p>
<p>ther degradation. Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogonis were hanged in November 
</p>
<p>1995, accused of instigating riots leading to the killings of four Ogoni elders, former 
</p>
<p>founders of MOSOP.&nbsp;NGOs perceived the prosecution as politically motivated and 
</p>
<p>the trial as unfair, but the appeal that was lodged fell on deaf ears, to some extent 
</p>
<p>because the group was being judged by a military tribunal. External calls for clem-
</p>
<p>ency from multiple heads of state, intergovernmental organizations and human 
</p>
<p>rights groups worldwide were ignored, provoking further widespread condemnation 
</p>
<p>around the world and drawing international sanctions and suspension from the 
</p>
<p>Commonwealth for Nigeria.
</p>
<p>Human rights NGOs claimed that Shell, whilst not directly responsible, was 
</p>
<p>heavily implicated by association with such incidents. Shell&rsquo;s business principles at 
</p>
<p>the time of the Saro-Wiwa incident spelt out that Shell would abstain &ldquo;from partici-
</p>
<p>pation in party politics and interference in political matters.&rdquo; On advice from its 
</p>
<p>lawyers, Shell limited its influence to pointing out the negative implications of 
</p>
<p>going ahead with the executions to the government and petitioning it for clemency. 
</p>
<p>But this was to no avail. Mark Corner, deputy managing director of SPDC, said:
</p>
<p>It took us too long to recognize that our voice should be heard. We were engineers inter-
ested in clever engineering, more introverted and conservative than we should have been. 
We are clearer now and feel that it is legitimate to have a more assertive position on human 
rights.
</p>
<p>NGOs continued to accuse Shell of not using a potentially powerful influence to 
</p>
<p>bring about change in the Delta. A conflict expert group commissioned by Shell in 
</p>
<p>2004 produced a confidential report (later leaked to the press) that stated &ldquo;If current 
</p>
<p>conflict trends continue uninterrupted, it would be surprising if Shell could continue 
</p>
<p>on-shore resource extraction in the Niger Delta whilst complying with Shell 
</p>
<p>Business principles.&rdquo; It also said that the SPDC &ldquo;&hellip;could not ignore Niger Delta 
</p>
<p>conflicts or its role in exacerbating these.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Because of Shell&rsquo;s close business relationship with the government, local com-
</p>
<p>munities perceived the company as working in cahoots with the authorities. This 
</p>
<p>perception was compounded by the fact that the government seconded the so- called 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;supernumerary police&rdquo; to Shell and other oil companies to protect staff and prop-
</p>
<p>erty. Like other oil companies Shell was dependent on the Nigerian government for 
</p>
<p>security arrangements that were critically important to protect their facilities.
</p>
<p>Local communities in the Delta objected to the degradation of their environment 
</p>
<p>resulting from oil spills, much of which, according to Shell, was due to sabotage. 
</p>
<p>The company argued that such sabotage was usually motivated by the desire for 
</p>
<p>economic gain on the part of some, but by no means all, individuals in its host com-
</p>
<p>munities. The prospect of compensation (if incidents could be disguised as the fault

</p>
<p>of the company), employment opportunities during the spill clean-up and the 
</p>
<p>attempted charging of &ldquo;access fees&rdquo; before staff and equipment were allowed on 
</p>
<p>site, were all temptations for communities that felt cheated of the benefits of local 
</p>
<p>oil production.
</p>
<p>In 1999 and 2003, to compound problems, politicians financed local warlords to 
</p>
<p>intimidate local people and to help rig elections. Given his political stance on cor-
</p>
<p>ruption, President Obasanjo and his state governors lost credibility. After the elec-
</p>
<p>tions, some Delta state governors continued to engage war lords to deal with political 
</p>
<p>rivals. The governors also turned a blind eye&nbsp;&ndash; and almost certainly profited from&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>war lords&rsquo; involvement in the theft of crude oil from existing pipelines. At the peak 
</p>
<p>of the crisis, some 10% of total annual production was stolen by ethnic militias in 
</p>
<p>this way. The lucrative dividends from this rich booty led to inevitable rivalry 
</p>
<p>between competing groups.
</p>
<p>The proceeds from the stolen oil helped to build up the arsenals of local militias. 
</p>
<p>Over time, arms entering the Delta paved the way for violent clashes between these 
</p>
<p>groups and an increasing lack of security in the area. Militancy reached a new high, 
</p>
<p>and even ordinary villagers tended to want to possess arms as a measure of self- 
</p>
<p>defense. Levels of corruption deepened; in January 2005, two navy rear admirals 
</p>
<p>were court-martialed and ousted, implicated in the disappearance of an impounded 
</p>
<p>tanker carrying stolen crude oil. Lack of employment in the Delta facilitated the 
</p>
<p>recruitment into militias of numerous disillusioned and bored young men only too 
</p>
<p>willing to earn some money.
</p>
<p>During 2005, some 50 Shell employees were kidnapped. Although hostage tak-
</p>
<p>ing of oil company staff had been commonplace since the early 1990s, the profile of 
</p>
<p>these actions changed dramatically, with hostages being kept for 2&ndash;3&nbsp;weeks rather 
</p>
<p>than the same number of days, and increasingly difficult negotiations with kidnap-
</p>
<p>pers. In 2006 particularly violent militia group attacks in the Delta succeeded in 
</p>
<p>cutting about 20% of Nigeria&rsquo;s 2.5 million barrel per day production. The main 
</p>
<p>culprit was the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a loose 
</p>
<p>coalition of guerrilla groups that were involved in crude oil theft and claimed to 
</p>
<p>have local Ijaw support (the majority tribe in the Delta). MEND demanded the 
</p>
<p>release of an imprisoned war lord and even a former state governor convicted for 
</p>
<p>money laundering. Becoming more powerful in the Delta towards the end of 2005, 
</p>
<p>MEND later demanded $1.5 billion from Shell to compensate for environmental 
</p>
<p>damage, and demanded increased access to oil revenues from the oil-producing 
</p>
<p>states of Nigeria.
</p>
<p>MEND transformed the security context of the Delta. It had well-armed units and 
</p>
<p>trained supporters with the potential to destroy oil facilities more effectively than any 
</p>
<p>group before them. Hostage-taking episodes were often followed by military attacks 
</p>
<p>by the federal government on the guerrilla groups, who hid in villages in the area. 
</p>
<p>Local resentment increased even further. It seemed that there would inevitably be 
</p>
<p>more militancy, more unrest and more chaos in the run-up to new elections in 2007.

</p>
<p> Sustainability and Human Rights at Shell
</p>
<p>In 1996, after the Saro-Wiwa incident and also as a result of the Brent Spar debacle,4 
</p>
<p>three Shell had moved from a risk and reputation management focus to integrating 
</p>
<p>sustainable development into its general business principles strategies and opera-
</p>
<p>tions. It reviewed its community activities in Nigeria and made changes to its phil-
</p>
<p>anthropic Community Assistance Program, renaming it Community Development 
</p>
<p>and placing more emphasis on capacity building and the empowerment of commu-
</p>
<p>nities. It started to engage in more extensive stakeholder discussion. This was an 
</p>
<p>eye-opener for the company, as Detheridge pointed out:
</p>
<p>We had discussions with international NGOs, Foundations and Government officials. 
Everyone, including Shell, sat in meetings pointing the finger elsewhere, effectively saying; 
&ldquo;If only you did what I am telling you to do, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation.&rdquo; Shell came 
at it from the angle of &ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t understand&nbsp;&ndash; get better informed.&rdquo; Each party thought 
that others could solve the problem, not realizing that solutions were beyond the reach of a 
single actor. Not surprisingly, it took a while for these discussions to lead to anything posi-
tive happening on the ground in Nigeria.
</p>
<p>Eventually, however, Shell began to set up partnership projects, first with local 
</p>
<p>NGOs and later with international NGOs and development agencies such as UNDP 
</p>
<p>and UNAIDS.&nbsp;Udofia commented:
</p>
<p>We moved from a stance of &ldquo;We want to do everything ourselves,&rdquo; which was impossible, 
to the idea that collaboration would be more effective.
</p>
<p>In order to place more emphasis on transparency and social accountability, in 
</p>
<p>1996 the company started publishing an annual SPDC People and the Environment 
</p>
<p>report and began a yearly stakeholder consultation workshop to review SPDC&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>environmental and community programs. Starting in 2001, the company asked a 
</p>
<p>team of independent experts (from international NGOs, UN agencies, and so on) to 
</p>
<p>verify and grade the projects within its community development program. The 
</p>
<p>resultsof these reviews were published in the People and the Environment report 
</p>
<p>and in 2005, results indicated that 86% of the projects were functional and 64% 
</p>
<p>were successful. Detheridge knew from discussions with developmental organiza-
</p>
<p>tions (none of which published such figures openly) that this was a good track 
</p>
<p>record, particularly in Nigeria. But there was considerable scope for improvement. 
</p>
<p>Corner commented:
</p>
<p>In the past we tended to over promise and under deliver. The legacy of this approach is still 
around today&nbsp;&ndash; projects that we rushed into to get things done saying that we would worry 
about problems later. Also, the Niger Delta Development Commission, the body charged 
</p>
<p>4 When Shell attempted to dispose of the Brent Spar in the North Sea, the NGO Greenpeace orga-
nized a worldwide, high- profile media campaign against this plan, including calls for boycotts of 
Shell service stations. Under enormous public pressure, Shell abandoned its disposal plans 
although it later transpired that this would have been the safest option, both from an environmental 
and a health and safety perspective.

</p>
<p>with doing development projects in the Delta is often under-funded, increasing reliance on 
SPDC.&nbsp;This situation is gradually improving but slowly. We have now learned that you need 
to work with community leaders, prepare well and hand over efficiently. Regaining the 
confidence of the communities is important.
</p>
<p> The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
</p>
<p>The EITI was a voluntary partnership of companies, governments, investors and 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations. It was launched by UK Prime Minister Tony Blair at the 
</p>
<p>World Summit for Sustainable Development in September 2002 to improve trans-
</p>
<p>parency and accountability related to the payments that oil, gas and mining compa-
</p>
<p>nies (including those that were state-owned) made to governments and the revenues 
</p>
<p>that governments received from these companies. Shell was an active participant in 
</p>
<p>the EITI and one of its main instigators.
</p>
<p>Detheridge and Udofia believed from the start that this was an important initia-
</p>
<p>tive that was necessary, though not in itself sufficient, to improve the governance of 
</p>
<p>oil revenue flows in Nigeria to ensure that they were put to good use. They realized 
</p>
<p>that the $3&ndash;$40 million that Shell spent on community development could not, on 
</p>
<p>its own, make a significant improvement to the lives of all the people in the Niger 
</p>
<p>Delta and that better use of the substantial funds available to the state and local 
</p>
<p>governments was essential.
</p>
<p>The two men worked on bringing EITI to the president&rsquo;s attention, and from 
</p>
<p>2002 onwards, Shell began to publish the revenues it paid to the Nigerian govern-
</p>
<p>ment, having first obtained the requisite authorization to do so from the government. 
</p>
<p>Corner commented:
</p>
<p>In fact, there was nothing to stop Shell as an organization helping to make the case for 
transparent revenue flow. We should have started sooner, but we balked at appearing overly 
paternalistic. The question is, are we a foreign company in Nigeria or a Nigerian company 
in Nigeria? It is actually more helpful to think of ourselves as the latter.
</p>
<p>The EITI Principles and Criteria
</p>
<p>The EITI Principles
</p>
<p> 1. We Share a belief that the prudent use of natural resource wealth should 
</p>
<p>be an important engine for sustainable economic growth that contributes 
</p>
<p>to sustainable development and poverty reduction, but if not managed 
</p>
<p>properly, can create negative economic and social impacts.
</p>
<p> 2. We affirm that management of natural resource wealth for the benefit of 
</p>
<p>a country&rsquo;s citizens is in Lie domain of sovereign governments to be exer-
</p>
<p>cised in the interests of their national development.
</p>
<p> 3. We recognise that the benefits of resource extraction occur as revenue 
</p>
<p>streams over many years and can be highly price dependent.

</p>
<p>The EITI worked toward improving transparency in government budget practices as 
</p>
<p>well as empowering ordinary citizens to hold their governments to account for the 
</p>
<p>use of the revenues (refer to boxed text below for the EITI Principles). The main 
</p>
<p>objective was to assure country ownership of the initiative. Given his political 
</p>
<p>agenda of good governance and his keenness to secure relief for Nigeria&rsquo;s stagger-
</p>
<p>ing $30 billion external debt, President Obasanja was one of the first leaders to sup-
</p>
<p>port the initiative. The Nigerians set up a country-specific, Nigerian Extractive 
</p>
<p>Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) in February 2004.
</p>
<p>On January 1, 2005, Basil Omiyl was the first Nigerian managing director 
</p>
<p>appointed to SPDC.&nbsp;Up to then, the post had been filled by expatriate staff. Corner 
</p>
<p>commented:
</p>
<p>We gained a lot of credibility with this appointment amongst our senior stakeholders. 
Somehow a Nigerian managing director had more leeway to openly state that the federal 
and state government should be more accountable to communities.
</p>
<p> 4. We recognise that a public understanding of government revenues and 
</p>
<p>expenditure over time could help public debate and inform choice of 
</p>
<p>appropriate and realistic options for sustainable development.
</p>
<p> 5. We underline the importance of transparency by governments and com-
</p>
<p>panies in the extractive industries and the need to enhance public finan-
</p>
<p>cial management and accountability.
</p>
<p> 6. We recognise that achievement of greater transparency must be set in the 
</p>
<p>context of respect for contracts and laws.
</p>
<p> 7. We recognise the enhanced environment for domestic and foreign direct 
</p>
<p>investment that financial transparency may bring.
</p>
<p> 8. We believe in the principle and practice of accountability by government 
</p>
<p>to all citizens for the stewardship of revenue streams and public 
</p>
<p>expenditure.
</p>
<p> 9. We are committed to encouraging high standards of transparency and 
</p>
<p>accountability in public life, government operations and in business.
</p>
<p> 10. We believe that a broadly consistent and workable approach to the disclo-
</p>
<p>sure of payments and revenues is required, which is simple to undertake 
</p>
<p>and to use.
</p>
<p> 11. We believe that payments&rsquo; disclosure in a given country should involve 
</p>
<p>all extractive industry companies operating in that country.
</p>
<p> 12. In seeking solutions, we believe that all stakeholders have important and 
</p>
<p>relevant contributions to make&nbsp;&ndash; including governments and their agen-
</p>
<p>cies, extractive industry companies, service companies, multilateral 
</p>
<p>organisations, financial organisations, investors, and non-governmental

</p>
<p>Nigeria set up two statutory bodies with powers to investigate and prosecute 
</p>
<p>corruption- related crimes. By 2006, the finance minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a 
</p>
<p>former World Bank vice president and corporate secretary, was making valiant 
</p>
<p>efforts to model Nigerian practice on the World Bank&rsquo;s integrity unit. She pushed 
</p>
<p>three new corruption-related laws and set up institutions for budget control, public 
</p>
<p>procurement and oil and gas transparency. British government experts praised 
</p>
<p>Nigeria for going further than any other country in terms of disaggregating pay-
</p>
<p>ments and tracing production volumes and procurement practices. From the begin-
</p>
<p>ning of 2004, Okonjo-Iweala started researching and recording allocations of 
</p>
<p>revenue paid since 1999 to the federal government, the 36 states of Nigeria and the 
</p>
<p>national capital of Abuja, and to local government authorities in each state. SPDC 
</p>
<p>assisted in the process. But Detheridge had a concern:
</p>
<p>In civil society in Nigeria, there is no track record of holding publicly elected officials 
accountable. It is good to publish the numbers, but government capacity building is needed 
to enable these to be presented in an understandable way to citizens. The same is true for 
civil society so that they can make use of the information that they receive.
</p>
<p>When the figures were published, it was clear that the four main oil-producing 
</p>
<p>states in the Delta received more revenues than other Nigerian states. In the first 
</p>
<p>10&nbsp;months of 2005, for example, Lagos (not a Delta state but with a population of 
</p>
<p>10.6 million) received $200 million in revenues from the federal government. By 
</p>
<p>contrast Delta states Rivers (pop. 5.7 million), Bayelsa (pop. 2 million) and Delta 
</p>
<p>(pop. 4.2 million) received $790 million, $710 million and $570 million respec-
</p>
<p>tively. In total, the federal government allocated $6.8 billion to the 36 states in 
</p>
<p>Nigeria. Nearly 35% of that amount went to the four major oil-producing states of 
</p>
<p>the Delta (refer to Fig.&nbsp;9.3 for the federal government&rsquo;s revenue allocation to states 
</p>
<p>from 2001 to 2005).
</p>
<p>Partly because of moves on the transparency initiative, Nigeria was granted $18 
</p>
<p>billion debt relief by international creditors and, from being bottom of the rankings 
</p>
<p>of Transparency International&rsquo;s corruption index in 2000, Nigeria improved margin-
</p>
<p>ally by 2005 to sixth among the eight worst countries (out of 159).
</p>
<p>In 2005 a British company, Hart Nurse Group, was asked by the NEITI to audit 
</p>
<p>the accounts of payments made by the oil companies against government-reported 
</p>
<p>revenue for the period 1999/2004. A three-volume report was produced in April 
</p>
<p>2006 with breakdowns of payments made by each company. The audit was only 
</p>
<p>partial in that the auditors did not have a mandate to look at the destination of funds 
</p>
<p>once deposited in the Central Bank, and did not address the controversial issue of 
</p>
<p>oil block licensing rounds and how contracts were awarded. A National Planning 
</p>
<p>Commission survey of the state governments revealed significant shortcomings in 
</p>
<p>accounts maintenance, controls against payroll fraud, fiscal management, service 
</p>
<p>delivery and procurement procedures in general. Few States had any level of trans-
</p>
<p>parency. Moreover, the federal government was not in a position to insist on such 
</p>
<p>transparency as the Nigerian constitution stipulated the autonomy of the states on

</p>
<p>matters such as revenue management. Olav Ljosne, regional external affairs man-
</p>
<p>ager for Africa (based in Nigeria), explained:
</p>
<p>The intention of the constitution is to prevent federal interference in state affairs. Only the 
state legislative, not even the president, has power to call state governors to account for 
moneys given to them.
</p>
<p>Under the military dictatorships, control was centralized. Under civil rule, the states 
</p>
<p>had considerably more power and autonomy. The Delta State&rsquo;s economic power 
</p>
<p>was greatly strengthened by its 13% share of the federal government&rsquo;s revenues 
</p>
<p>from oil. This did not stop its governors from campaigning at the July 2005 consti-
</p>
<p>tutional conference and elsewhere for an even greater percentage while diverting 
</p>
<p>attention from the accountability issue that was also on the agenda.
</p>
<p> Changing the Legacy: Shell&rsquo;s Next Steps
</p>
<p>Back in 2006, Detheridge and Udofia realized that, given the complexity of Nigerian 
</p>
<p>human rights challenges, a longer-than-usual series of briefing sessions with their 
</p>
<p>successors would be necessary. They had to describe the learning process that Shell 
</p>
<p>had gone through. Udofia&rsquo;s view was that Shell was at a &ldquo;make it or break it&rdquo; point. 
</p>
<p>Where did a private company&rsquo;s role begin and end and where did the governments&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>begin&nbsp;&ndash; how far could Shell go with the values it espoused without exceeding its 
</p>
<p>remit? What else needed to be done on the governance and transparency agenda? 
</p>
<p>And crucially, what other longer term partnership initiatives, like EITI were needed?

<p>183
</p>
<p>While discussing this, they wondered what their best advice might be for Shell&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>next steps. They prepared an agenda for the upcoming session.
</p>
<p> Analysis: Shell&rsquo;s Learning
</p>
<p> Company Learning
</p>
<p>Decision-making executives at Shell have learnt a great deal from the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>less successful and more reactive approaches of the past and clearly now encourage 
</p>
<p>and promote proactive stakeholder-engaging attitudes that lead to more positive out-
</p>
<p>comes. Although stakeholders continue to criticize Shell for lacking a principled 
</p>
<p>approach in the Niger Delta and for being slow to recognize and be vocal about 
</p>
<p>ongoing corruption issues, progress has been made. Many suggested that Shell 
</p>
<p>should have become more active in terms of its full social responsibility role much 
</p>
<p>sooner, for example, by publicly objecting to the Ogoni executions. Although we 
</p>
<p>are many years later, institutional learning from the past on such delicate issues is 
</p>
<p>essential. It is important that the learning in Nigeria becomes integrated as part of 
</p>
<p>Shell&rsquo;s corporate &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; This is a robust way of maintaining momentum and cor-
</p>
<p>porate readiness on such complex and sometimes &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; issues.
</p>
<p> Strategy Development
</p>
<p>Considering that Shell has now gathered some invaluable learning from mistakes 
</p>
<p>made in the past, there is a real opportunity to put this into practice. However, the 
</p>
<p>learning from issue management should also lead to fundamental changes in strat-
</p>
<p>egy, and not only contribute to risk management. Changes in Shell&rsquo;s actions over the 
</p>
<p>last decade in particular illustrate the results of a much more reflective process 
</p>
<p>where strategy and stakeholder engagement is concerned. Examples are:
</p>
<p> &ndash; Shift from charity programs in&nbsp; local communities to community development 
</p>
<p>activities.
</p>
<p> &ndash; The company is more engaged, responsible and responsive.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Shift to publishing financial figures and providing transparency on where Shell 
</p>
<p>money goes.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Promotion of a native Nigerian as head of SDPC.
</p>
<p> Cohesive Focus
</p>
<p>It is&nbsp;&ndash; still today&nbsp;&ndash; important that the focus on fighting corruption does not take away 
</p>
<p>from other efforts on human rights issues in the field. While Shell is still trying hard 
</p>
<p>to address the root problems, the situation in the Niger Delta has evolved to become 
</p>
<p>even more dangerous, particularly for employees at risk of being kidnapped. 
</p>
<p>9 Revenue Flow and Human Rights: The Paradoxes of Shell in Nigeria</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>184
</p>
<p>Increasing communication is a solution that the company has fully adopted, while 
</p>
<p>continuing to push transparency to the utmost. However, one problem might be that 
</p>
<p>some of the main actors, such as local communities and the &ldquo;war lords,&rdquo; are not 
</p>
<p>actually part of the &ldquo;coalition&rdquo; around the transparency issues. Power in the Delta 
</p>
<p>has become increasingly fragmented, and the situation, over the past few years has 
</p>
<p>gained, not reduced, in complexity. Any new actor in this scenario will find it 
</p>
<p>exceedingly difficult to get to grips with this complexity, which cannot be underes-
</p>
<p>timated. Continuing operations in such environments is difficult and sometimes 
</p>
<p>opportunities for influencing the situation are limited. The key lies in applying that 
</p>
<p>limited influence in the right way.
</p>
<p> Stay or Go?
</p>
<p>In the context of &ldquo;risk mitigation,&rdquo; retaining a presence in Nigeria would still be the 
</p>
<p>best option for Shell rather than considering moving out of Nigeria. Apart from the 
</p>
<p>fact that the Nigerian operations are part of Shell&rsquo;s core business (making it difficult 
</p>
<p>to withdraw from that point of view alone), Shell has over time become a much 
</p>
<p>more responsible player in the Delta. Should the company withdraw, it risks being 
</p>
<p>replaced by another player with much less experience in the area, which could 
</p>
<p>potentially escalate the already tense situation there. It takes years to develop suc-
</p>
<p>cessful working relations with government authorities in developing countries with 
</p>
<p>tenuous political situations. The company has realized that its own social initiatives/
</p>
<p>programs, while an important demonstration of its goodwill, are merely a drop in 
</p>
<p>the ocean in light of the endemic corruption and the resulting continuing poverty of 
</p>
<p>the population. In spite of the ongoing tensions and challenges, Shell now appears 
</p>
<p>to be headed in the right direction, pushing transparency initiatives and giving the 
</p>
<p>population/voters information on the basis of which they can hold politicians/civil 
</p>
<p>servants accountable.
</p>
<p> The SWOT of Shell&rsquo;s Position in Nigeria
</p>
<p> Strengths and Opportunities
</p>
<p> Shell&rsquo;s Experience
Shell has had long and valuable experience in Nigeria. It has gained influence as one 
</p>
<p>of the government&rsquo;s key partners and can lead state players to better performance in 
</p>
<p>oil production through special management solutions. Shell has strengthened its 
</p>
<p>corporate social responsibility strategy since it first got involved in the Delta and has 
</p>
<p>become a global leader in human rights/corruption issues. It has strengthened its 
</p>
<p>image in communities by giving more thought to the most appropriate (or effective) 
</p>
<p>social programs. It thus has increased its ability and scope to apply pressure on the 
</p>
<p>government. Nigeria needs Shell&rsquo;s know-how and technology, and the company has 
</p>
<p>complemented this with development expertise and more coherent management 
</p>
<p>A. M. Ionescu-Somers</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>185
</p>
<p>systems. However, increasingly powerful Chinese/Indian companies are only too 
</p>
<p>willing to step in and replace established multinational majors in the Delta, given 
</p>
<p>the chance. We suggest that this would be detrimental to the tenuous situation in the 
</p>
<p>Niger Delta, since an acute awareness of the complexities of working in the area and 
</p>
<p>knowledge of &ldquo;the playing field&rdquo; are required if an even more difficult situation is to 
</p>
<p>be avoided. Shell can still make a real business case for staying in the country and 
</p>
<p>over the long term, Shell can invest in creating a more stable, sustainable operating 
</p>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p> Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
International awareness of the issues of human rights and corruption is greater than 
</p>
<p>ever (contributing factors are attention from the World Bank, IBLF&nbsp;&ndash; the International 
</p>
<p>Business Leaders Forum, Transparency International, UN initiatives and the cre-
</p>
<p>ation of the Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security5 and so on). From 
</p>
<p>a relatively weak earlier position as described in the case, Shell has now moved, 
</p>
<p>particularly over the last decade&nbsp;&ndash; through the EITI&nbsp;&ndash; to a much stronger position. 
</p>
<p>The EITI gives an opportunity to &ldquo;play by the book.&rdquo; Also, in many ways, &ldquo;a prob-
</p>
<p>lem shared is a problem halved&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; the involvement of other stakeholders serves to 
</p>
<p>support Shell&rsquo;s moves in the Niger Delta and makes it more difficult for media and 
</p>
<p>NGO players to paint the company in an entirely bad light. The EITI has demon-
</p>
<p>strated Shell&rsquo;s goodwill in entering into a positive dialogue with the government and 
</p>
<p>other players on issues related to corruption with a commitment to transparency. In 
</p>
<p>short, Shell is leading by example by being an honest corporation and good corpo-
</p>
<p>rate citizen.
</p>
<p> Corporate Influence: &ldquo;He Who Pays the Piper&hellip;.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the revenue that Shell provides to the government through the 
</p>
<p>production of oil protects its position. The company is a major player and is listened 
</p>
<p>to since it has the ear of Western governments to which it can provide good connec-
</p>
<p>tions. Over time the company has come to recognize the importance of MNCs being 
</p>
<p>outspoken about the need to recognize human rights issues and proactively promote 
</p>
<p>anti-corruption efforts. Along with its expertise/credibility in the oil business, all of 
</p>
<p>these factors will ensure that Shell&rsquo;s reputation will be more protected, not less. The 
</p>
<p>decision to employ a local national to head up Shell&rsquo;s Nigerian company went a 
</p>
<p>long way toward increasing Shell&rsquo;s credibility in Nigeria and in the outside world.
</p>
<p>5 See www.voluntaryprinciples.org: The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights were 
created by governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Norway; 
companies in the extractive and energy sectors; and NGOs (all with an interest in human rights and 
corporate social responsibility) to guide companies in maintaining the safety and security of their 
operations within an operating framework that ensures respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms.

</p>
<p> Weaknesses and Threats
</p>
<p> Relationship with Government
</p>
<p>Shell&rsquo;s dependence on government decision- making could, unless managed judi-
</p>
<p>ciously, make it a &ldquo;hostage&rdquo; of the government. The company is a foreign presence 
</p>
<p>in Nigeria, operating as a &ldquo;guest&rdquo; in the country, and it has limited influence on 
</p>
<p>many political levels, some of them extremely subtle. The same is true for many 
</p>
<p>extraction industries. However, as mentioned above, the establishment of EITI is 
</p>
<p>helping Shell to counteract the effects of earlier overdependence and inability to 
</p>
<p>speak out forcefully on some issues. The company is still dependent on the govern-
</p>
<p>ment for the security of its personnel, which still constitutes a risk given past history 
</p>
<p>and the continuing tense situation in the Niger Delta.
</p>
<p> Threats to Reputation
</p>
<p>Although the EITI has helped Shell to overcome its previously negative image in 
</p>
<p>Nigeria, the company is still not always perceived as a &ldquo;good citizen&rdquo; by NGOs or 
</p>
<p>the press. Countering the effect of this on public opinion requires a long-term 
</p>
<p>effort. Rightly or wrongly, larger branded companies are constantly being attacked 
</p>
<p>by NGOs that have a lot to gain from the exposure this brings to the sustainability 
</p>
<p>issues they campaign for. Shell must be prepared to be under scrutiny for a long 
</p>
<p>time to come. In addition, Shell represents an industry that is itself under increas-
</p>
<p>ing scrutiny because of climate change; media coverage is likely to continue to 
</p>
<p>focus on the oil majors, thus potentially exposing any other visible issues. The 
</p>
<p>boundaries of sustainability issues, therefore, may well overlap. In addition, the 
</p>
<p>involvement in the EITI leaves Shell with little scope for error. Having such a 
</p>
<p>strong role means that the company would lose considerable credibility if it were 
</p>
<p>implicated in another scandal.
</p>
<p> Ongoing Conflict
</p>
<p>Nigeria is subject to ongoing political, social and economic instability. The situation 
</p>
<p>in the Niger Delta is becoming even more tense, with increasingly serious breaches 
</p>
<p>of the law through kidnapping and so on. There may come a stage when operating 
</p>
<p>in the area will have to be seriously reviewed for security and safety reasons. There 
</p>
<p>is already considerable risk to Shell employees and their families during an ongoing 
</p>
<p>vicious cycle of kidnapping. The &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo; may be reached sooner rather than 
</p>
<p>later as sabotage of installations and critical kidnapping incidents increase.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>187
</p>
<p> Economic Situation
</p>
<p>Nigeria is one of the poorest countries in the world. Shell represents a capital- 
</p>
<p>intensive industry that can only benefit a small number of people directly (employ-
</p>
<p>ees). This is bound to continue to create tension in the areas affected and is 
</p>
<p>exacerbated by the corruption of the feedback system, which might otherwise 
</p>
<p>ensure that some wealth reaches the areas in a more indirect way. The business 
</p>
<p>model is currently still not in line with public perception and, unless remedied, this 
</p>
<p>will lead to a gradual loss of the license to operate in the Niger Delta area.
</p>
<p> Cultural Divide
</p>
<p>The cultural gaps between Shell (with a heavy expatriate weighting) and local cul-
</p>
<p>tures are difficult to overcome. However, by employing a local Nigerian as the CEO 
</p>
<p>of Shell Nigeria, the company took an important step in the right direction. Shell&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>expatriate presence has been reducing over time.
</p>
<p> Multinational Corporation Role
</p>
<p>Some of Shell&rsquo;s actions may be perceived as a multinational acting in place of gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. Many would question whether this is a role that an MNC should take on in 
</p>
<p>Nigeria. The limits of Shell&rsquo;s role need constant attention and should be continu-
</p>
<p>ously reviewed. For example, the potency of the GmoU for sustainable development 
</p>
<p>is hampered by a number of challenges such as the enormity and complexity of the 
</p>
<p>development challenge in the Delta thrown up by the failings of an absentee state, 
</p>
<p>the structural constraints imposed on corporations by the profit-maximizing motive 
</p>
<p>and cultural factors that not only prevent effective participation but also promote 
</p>
<p>disempowerment of marginalized groups such as women.
</p>
<p> Recruitment/Retention of Qualified Personnel/Management
</p>
<p>Given the risks to personnel in the Delta, Shell may experience increasing problems 
</p>
<p>in getting qualified personnel willing to live and work there.
</p>
<p> Political Situation
</p>
<p>The smooth handover of government in a democratic election had as yet never hap-
</p>
<p>pened in Nigeria. The background to the country&rsquo;s leadership had been fraught with 
</p>
<p>conflict and violent incidents. There is no guarantee that the government&rsquo;s anti- 
</p>
<p>corruption focus would be continued by any new incumbent, even though the 
</p>
<p>9 Revenue Flow and Human Rights: The Paradoxes of Shell in Nigeria</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188
</p>
<p>Nigerian government would lose considerable credibility by making an &ldquo;about 
</p>
<p>turn&rdquo; (however, the history of conflict in Africa has meant that this is not always the 
</p>
<p>most important criterion).
</p>
<p> Sustainability of Oil
</p>
<p>The fact that Shell is exploiting a non-renewable resource will remain an underlying 
</p>
<p>and constant weakness of its business model, since the concept of exploiting the 
</p>
<p>commodity will constantly be under attack.
</p>
<p> Axes of Action Available to Shell
</p>
<p> Shell&rsquo;s Position on Human Rights
</p>
<p>Shell has to continue to make sure that it is not in any way complicit in the violation 
</p>
<p>of human rights. This engages the company in being more vocal and adopting a 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach. Conducting an ongoing human rights analysis of Shell&rsquo;s cur-
</p>
<p>rent situation in the Delta is pertinent and advisable.
</p>
<p> Maintain Leadership Position in Transparency
</p>
<p>Through a continuous improvement process and multi-stakeholder dialogue, Shell 
</p>
<p>should be able to reach a position of complete transparency regarding its operations 
</p>
<p>and wealth generated for Nigeria from activities in the Delta. Ensuring that Nigerian 
</p>
<p>citizens (and particularly those from the Niger Delta) benefit from the EITI is a 
</p>
<p>major focus of its activities. The company is involved in developing local awareness 
</p>
<p>about revenue flows and thus the capacity of citizen groups to hold local (and fed-
</p>
<p>eral) authorities accountable for oil revenue. The company can also support the 
</p>
<p>Nigerian government in strengthening the judiciary system.
</p>
<p> Act Local
</p>
<p>Shell should continue to judiciously support local activities. Apart from a focus on 
</p>
<p>money streams, there also needs to be more transparency on how to deal with prob-
</p>
<p>lems at site, with communities. This will help the company to develop skills for 
</p>
<p>dealing with the upcoming conflicts of Nigerian society. There may also be scope 
</p>
<p>for being more ambitious on the local level by emulating already successful busi-
</p>
<p>ness models that, for example, provide micro-finance to women to help them own 
</p>
<p>A. M. Ionescu-Somers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>189
</p>
<p>and run small enterprises (such as those funded by the Grameen Bank6). This would 
</p>
<p>help switch the political focus to bolstering the economy in other ways (rather than 
</p>
<p>relying on oil wealth) and to diversifying industries.
</p>
<p> Use Other Stakeholders to Support Action
</p>
<p>Given its past history in the Niger Delta, Shell has become adept at handling media 
</p>
<p>attention on the issues that have constantly come up in the Delta. Over the past 
</p>
<p>10&nbsp;years, there have been opportunities to use the media in a more proactive and 
</p>
<p>positive way&nbsp; &ndash; to advertise and broadcast efforts being made to render Nigeria 
</p>
<p>corruption-free.
</p>
<p> Engage in Stakeholder Dialogue
</p>
<p>Shell has evolved to think of itself as &ldquo;just one other stakeholder&rdquo; in the Niger Delta. 
</p>
<p>The company could also use other (global) organizations (for example, the World 
</p>
<p>Bank and the IMF) to help improve government practices/transparency. Shell could 
</p>
<p>also partner with other entities (e.g. governments such as the US and UK which 
</p>
<p>have substantial influence on mobilizing the Nigerian government) and NGOs (such 
</p>
<p>as Transparency International). Relationships with NGOs could help clarify and 
</p>
<p>identify future issues, therefore allowing companies to be closer to the ground in 
</p>
<p>understanding the issues, and help protect the license to operate by obtaining the 
</p>
<p>buy-in of local communities. NGOs can also help with the implementation of proj-
</p>
<p>ects. Collaboration brings corporate financial and managerial resources together 
</p>
<p>with local knowledge of NGOs&nbsp;&ndash; a powerful combination. Also, because of their 
</p>
<p>local knowledge, NGOs can sometimes implement aspects of a project more quickly 
</p>
<p>and cheaply than a corporation. Another benefit of working with NGOs is that it can 
</p>
<p>give the corporation more credibility and build trust with communities. Association 
</p>
<p>with an organization that is considered&nbsp;&ndash; in the communities&rsquo; eyes&nbsp;&ndash; more credible 
</p>
<p>than a company will help identify common ground on which to operate. In addition, 
</p>
<p>NGOs have the advantage that they are able&nbsp;&ndash; even expected&nbsp;&ndash; to speak more openly 
</p>
<p>about social and environmental issues than a company.
</p>
<p>Indeed, Shell has become a conduit for bringing stakeholders together such as 
</p>
<p>militias and local communities, and federal and state governments. The company 
</p>
<p>can identify local leaders to work with (sometimes behind the scenes), other African 
</p>
<p>6 The Grameen Bank is a microfinance organization and community development bank initiated 
in Bangladesh. It makes small loans (called micro-credit) to the poor to allow them to set up small 
businesses, e.g. weaving, pottery, storage and transportation services, without having to put up 
collateral. The bank also accepts deposits, provides other services, and runs several development- 
oriented businesses including fabric, telephone and energy companies. The organization and its 
founder, Muhammad Yunus, were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.

</p>
<p>leaders/countries (through the African Union7 for example) and other industry part-
</p>
<p>ners. Such action would support the Nigerian government&rsquo;s efforts to fulfill its role 
</p>
<p>regarding human rights. Is to help build bridges with religious leaders, usually much 
</p>
<p>respected by politicians and local populations alike. Moreover, Shell could facilitate 
</p>
<p>dialogue with other oil-producing developing countries. In other words, the com-
</p>
<p>pany could form a coalition of stakeholders to bring about change. Shell&rsquo;s advan-
</p>
<p>tage is that it has the convening power to bring these parties together to discuss/
</p>
<p>analyze problems and work on solutions. Shell arguably has still not done enough 
</p>
<p>to exert its influence. Now is the time to exert that influence.
</p>
<p>Moving forward, apart from keeping production going as a business goal, the 
</p>
<p>priorities could continue to be general local development, continuing to &ldquo;do the 
</p>
<p>right thing&rdquo; through reconciliation and engagement with communities, NGOs and 
</p>
<p>media, while aiming for clarity&nbsp;&ndash; and asking what are the limits to Shell&rsquo;s responsi-
</p>
<p>bility/accountability? Shell could be a real catalyst for change in getting govern-
</p>
<p>ment to take on its role of developing the Nigerian economy and providing for basic 
</p>
<p>human needs. The direct impact of Shell&rsquo;s efforts will remain limited, but indirect 
</p>
<p>impacts in terms of multiplying effects could be substantial. Encouraging govern-
</p>
<p>ment to do things well in the medium to long term will be better for the country and 
</p>
<p>population overall.
</p>
<p> Epilogue: Ten Years Later&hellip;&hellip;
</p>
<p> Shell&rsquo;s Role and Direction in the Niger Delta in 2015
</p>
<p>Since 2006 and up to the time of writing, SPDC had greatly improved on how it 
</p>
<p>engages with local communities to deliver its social projects. Firstly, in 2006 a local 
</p>
<p>national was appointed as Managing Director of the SPDC and this eased the way 
</p>
<p>to better relations with stakeholders overall. In the course of 2006, the company 
</p>
<p>introduced a new framework for working with communities called the Global 
</p>
<p>Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU). This was an extremely important shift in 
</p>
<p>approach, since it placed more emphasis on transparent, accountable processes, 
</p>
<p>regular communications with the grassroots, sustainability and conflict prevention.
</p>
<p>A GMoU is an agreement between SPDC and a group (termed &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;) of sev-
</p>
<p>eral communities. Clusters are based on local government or clan/historical affinity 
</p>
<p>lines defined in consultation with the relevant state government. The GMoU brings 
</p>
<p>communities together with representatives of state and local governments, SPDC 
</p>
<p>and non-profit organizations, such as development NGOs, in a decision-making 
</p>
<p>committee called the Cluster Development Board (CDB). Under the terms of the

</p>
<p>that the communities have stable and reliable finances as they undertake the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of their community development plans.
</p>
<p>The advantage of the GMoUs is that they promote better ownership and a strong 
</p>
<p>sense of pride amongst communities since they are responsible for implementing 
</p>
<p>their projects. They are also a robust platform for additional local or international 
</p>
<p>donors to fund development projects directly through the Cluster Development 
</p>
<p>Boards (CBDs). They are popular with communities, since ownership in its turn 
</p>
<p>promotes better projects, increasing sustainability and trust.
</p>
<p>Every aspect of each GMoU is implemented in partnerships with communities 
</p>
<p>and also a number&nbsp;&ndash; sometimes up to a dozen&nbsp;&ndash; facilitating non-profit organizations 
</p>
<p>that handle sensitization and communication of the GMoU model to the communi-
</p>
<p>ties while also developing the capacity of CDB members to handle community 
</p>
<p>development processes.
</p>
<p>They also ensure quality delivery of the GMoU projects and programs. By end of 
</p>
<p>2012, for example, SPDC had signed agreements with some 33 GMoU clusters, 
</p>
<p>covering 349 communities, which represents some 35% of the local communities 
</p>
<p>around business operations in the delta. In 2012, a total of 723 projects were suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully completed, and total funding for these projects amounted to over US$117 
</p>
<p>million in 2012 alone. Furthermore, some of the 33 CDBs had grown into registered 
</p>
<p>foundations receiving third party funding.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these positive developments on stakeholder management and 
</p>
<p>dialogue, Shell, as a high profile international company with the tumultuous track 
</p>
<p>record it has in the Niger Delta, continued to attract the ire of international NGOs. 
</p>
<p>In January 2015, for example, some 15,600 Ogoni farmers and fishermen were 
</p>
<p>awarded some &pound;2,000 each as part of a &pound;55 million pollution charge to Shell because 
</p>
<p>of pollution caused by two oil spills in 2008 and 2009. Communities were given 
</p>
<p>millions each to build health clinics and refurbish schools. While this would help to 
</p>
<p>alleviate the sharp end of poverty in the Delta, issues around damage to the environ-
</p>
<p>ment providing the wherewithal for people to live and make a living (fishing, farm-
</p>
<p>ing), will not be resolved quickly. The company has traditionally claimed that most 
</p>
<p>of the oil pollution is due to sabotage by rebels and others that tap into pipelines 
</p>
<p>illegally. Court documents used during the proceedings showed that the company 
</p>
<p>was aware of corroded installations and equipment faults as a significant risk factor. 
</p>
<p>Organizations such as Amnesty International accuse Shell of evading its responsi-
</p>
<p>bilities and of clouding the facts. Whatever the reality is, there is increasing pressure 
</p>
<p>on the company to be more transparent and to generally take more responsibility for 
</p>
<p>past and future contamination of the Delta.
</p>
<p>Moreover, in &hellip;., Shell took a decision to dissolve its centralized sustainability 
</p>
<p>function at its corporate headquarters in London. One executive presented appoint 
</p>
<p>of view on the impact:
</p>
<p>We were fortunate that Shell CEOs Mark Moody Stuart and then later Phil Watts saw value 
in profiling sustainability quite highly. However, since their time, successive CEOs did not 
necessarily see the same value in strategic sustainability. Maybe dismemberment of the 
sustainability function happened too soon and went too deep. When a new CEO comes on 
board, he or she will question if this or that activity is worthwhile. Often it depends on how

</p>
<p>well an argument is articulated to them by senior executives. The closing of the sustain-
ability function left a gap in that respect. What you want to do is have sustainability in the 
hearts and minds of every employee first. Only then does devolving make any sense. 
Granted, having a large sustainability organization at the head office is ultimately not the 
way to go. Mainstreaming is necessary. However, if you dismantle thought leadership at 
head office level, then the senior leadership is not challenged enough on these issues. 
Business managers have a lot to attend to not least falling oil prices. Sustainability issues 
may tend to go to the bottom of the pile. Maybe this does not matter now, but if there is a 
scandal, it certainly will matter!&rdquo;

<p> Nigeria and the NNPC in 2015
</p>
<p>Despite expansion in services, consumer industries and agriculture over the last 
</p>
<p>10&ndash;15&nbsp;years, in 2015 Nigeria still depended on oil for in excess of two thirds of state 
</p>
<p>revenues and virtually all of its export earnings. Nigeria&rsquo;s National Petroleum 
</p>
<p>Corporation&nbsp;&ndash; the state oil company&nbsp;&ndash; continued to evolve in a web of patronage and 
</p>
<p>allegations of criminality, allegedly setting up complex deals that opened up the way 
</p>
<p>to fraud in fuel subsidy allocations and contracts, amounting to perhaps up to US$1 
</p>
<p>billion a month in national revenues from sales. In 2014 PwC called for the company 
</p>
<p>to be urgently restructured after its audit revealed that billions of dollars were unac-
</p>
<p>counted for in its 2012 and 2013 accounts. According to a Financial Times article in 
</p>
<p>mid-2015, the NNPC had amassed billions in dollars in debts to its joint venture part-
</p>
<p>ners (including Shell). The fact that government controls the oil through NNPC is 
</p>
<p>preventing Nigeria from reaching its full potential of production of four million bar-
</p>
<p>rels a day of oil (almost double current output). Refineries in Nigeria are non-existent 
</p>
<p>and paradoxically, the country has to import most of its own fuel.
</p>
<p>Crude oil production in 2015 was in fact declining, and pipelines were still vul-
</p>
<p>nerable to oil thieves, who were stealing about 232,000 barrels every day, costing 
</p>
<p>the State further billions. The practices of &ldquo;bunkering&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; the trade in stolen oil&nbsp;&ndash; that 
</p>
<p>became common in the early years of the new Millennium, has escalated. Satellite 
</p>
<p>imagery reveals that artisanal refining has also increased across the Delta in the 
</p>
<p>period 2008&ndash;2013 on an industrial scale. In addition, many independent, parliamen-
</p>
<p>tary and government sponsored investigations have found that revenues from oil 
</p>
<p>sales are continuing to be siphoned off at epic levels.
</p>
<p>In 2009, Nigeria&rsquo;s then-President Umaru Musa Yar&rsquo;Adua had offered an amnesty 
</p>
<p>deal to thousands of militants, whose vandalism, theft and attacks in six states in the 
</p>
<p>Niger Delta region had cost Nigeria a third of its oil production. The Movement for 
</p>
<p>the Emancipation of the Niger Delta rebels agreed to lay down their arms in return 
</p>
<p>for an unconditional pardon and stipend. This was upheld by successive presidents 
</p>
<p>since; in 2015, Nigeria&rsquo;s new president Muhammadu Buhari renewed the commit-
</p>
<p>ment to maintain the amnesty.
</p>
<p>In July 2015, the NNPC banned more than 100 tankers from Nigeria&rsquo;s waters, under 
</p>
<p>a directive from Nigeria&rsquo;s new president Muhammadu Buhari who is focused on tracing 
</p>
<p>the large sums of money resulting from stolen oil sales. To reduce impact on its markets, 
</p>
<p>companies&nbsp;&ndash; including Shell&nbsp;&ndash; asked ship owners exporting their Nigerian oil to sign off 
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>193
</p>
<p>on a &ldquo;Letter of Comfort&rdquo; (LoC) guaranteeing that their loads were not stolen and prom-
</p>
<p>ising to indemnify the NNPC against illicit use of their vessel.
</p>
<p>We can therefore deduce from recent events in 2015, that the challenges of oil 
</p>
<p>exploitation in the Niger Delta and the barriers to transparency of the system as a 
</p>
<p>whole are far from over.
</p>
<p> The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in 2015
</p>
<p>In terms of the case story, the EITI had just started out on its long journey, a journey 
</p>
<p>that continues today. Now, 10&nbsp;years later, the initiative has exceeded all expectations in 
</p>
<p>terms of numbers of member companies (there are currently 48). The initiative suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully promotes multi-stakeholder dialogue on a high level and this in itself is a 
</p>
<p>major contribution to resolving some of the very complex issues it is set up to address.
</p>
<p>Two crucial questions can be asked. First, in what depth and detail should infor-
</p>
<p>mation about monetary flows be made public? Should it go right down to project 
</p>
<p>level? Nigeria still produces EITI reports that disclose revenues from the extraction 
</p>
<p>of its natural resources. Joint venture partners (companies such as Shell and Exxon) 
</p>
<p>disclose what they have paid in taxes and other payments and the government dis-
</p>
<p>closes what it has received. These two sets of figures are compared and reconciled. 
</p>
<p>The Nigerian government also publishes amounts being paid to Nigerian States. 
</p>
<p>EITI still settles for country level transparency, but has now set up a task force to 
</p>
<p>look closely at other levels of transparency i.e. state and project level. Secondly, and 
</p>
<p>more fundamentally, what exactly should be disclosed? For example, should each 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s contribution be accounted for separately?
</p>
<p>In the end of the day, there is a major unanswered dilemma: Does it make sense 
</p>
<p>to have a transparency initiative at all if parts of the system remain non-transparent? 
</p>
<p>Whilst the EITI is dealing with very important issues of transparency and account-
</p>
<p>ability in revenue flows related to extractive industries, it is unlikely that resolving 
</p>
<p>this issue alone will solve the fundamental social, environmental and economic 
</p>
<p>problems of countries like Nigeria.

<p>10Ziqitza Health Care Limited: Responding to&nbsp;Corruption
Robert&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Crawford and&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Craig&nbsp;Smith
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>After a monthly staff meeting, a young employee approached Sweta Mangal, CEO 
</p>
<p>of Ziqitza Health Care Limited (ZHL). Sanjay Rafati1 had been hired as a financial 
</p>
<p>officer the previous month, in November 2011. In view of the company&rsquo;s strict ethi-
</p>
<p>cal code, he was nervous about expressing his point of view, which was why he 
</p>
<p>wanted to see Ms. Mangal in private:
</p>
<p>The situation in one of the states where ZHL operates is getting critical. Unless the govern-
</p>
<p>ment pays what it owes us immediately, we will not be able to make payroll. We won&rsquo;t be 
</p>
<p>able to service our new ambulances, which will open us up to more accusations of negli-
</p>
<p>gence. Lives may be lost. This will devastate our morale and ruin our reputation. That 
</p>
<p>bureaucrat will never stop.
</p>
<p>Although Rafati had refrained from stating it directly, she understood that he 
</p>
<p>wanted her to bribe a recalcitrant official.
</p>
<p>This particular state had been a thorn in her side for 2&nbsp;years. While the timeliness 
</p>
<p>of payment varied from state to state, a delay of this length from a state government 
</p>
<p>was extremely rare. The predecessor of &ldquo;that bureaucrat&rdquo; had asked her to fly there, 
</p>
<p>only to cancel the meeting after she had arrived&nbsp;&ndash; a scenario that had played out no 
</p>
<p>fewer than seven times. &ldquo;He wanted us to bribe him,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and we 
</p>
<p>refused. He also didn&rsquo;t like the fact that I, a woman, lost my temper and told him 
</p>
<p>off.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Under the terms of the public-private partnership finally established with this 
</p>
<p>state under a new official in July 2010, ZHL planned to have a total of 464 
</p>
<p>1 Certain names have been changed for the purposes of this case. Unless otherwise noted, source 
material comes from interviews with ZHL employees or representatives.</p>

</p>
<p>ambulances, essentially doubling its ambulance fleet. This represented a major 
</p>
<p>investment. Now, the new state official was using the financial commitment ZHL 
</p>
<p>had already made to the state to up the pressure for a bribe, as she explained:
</p>
<p>Whenever we submitted invoices, they would send us a series of queries. We would answer 
</p>
<p>them and then they would raise a new set of queries. This followed a couple of times and the 
</p>
<p>concerned person used to ask for a bribe in a roundabout manner, but we ignored the same. 
</p>
<p>Then finally in Fall 2010, he asked directly: &lsquo;If you arrange to pay me 5&nbsp;% of the invoice 
</p>
<p>value, things will work out.&rsquo; When we raised the issue with his superiors, they asked us to 
</p>
<p>put the claim in writing. We did, but nothing changed, rather things worsened.
</p>
<p>The cycle, she feared, was never-ending.
</p>
<p>The financial calculation, she knew, was compelling: for a bribe of 5% of the 
</p>
<p>total due to ZHL, the entire payment would be made on time. Hundreds of thou-
</p>
<p>sands of rupees were in play.2 While legal adjudication of such issues was theoreti-
</p>
<p>cally becoming available through a civil court, it could take years to reach a decision; 
</p>
<p>even the way of functioning of the new court was yet to be established. ZHL needed 
</p>
<p>the money now. It couldn&rsquo;t run a business where one of its largest customers was not 
</p>
<p>paying its bills. The only alternative was a loan at 15% interest&nbsp;&ndash; triple the cost of 
</p>
<p>the bribe. But how sustainable would this be in the long term?
</p>
<p>Ms. Mangal spoke quietly, looking into Rafati&rsquo;s anxious eyes: &ldquo;You know that 
</p>
<p>we cannot&nbsp;&ndash; ever&nbsp;&ndash; offer a bribe. That would violate our most fundamental commit-
</p>
<p>ment to ethics and transparency.&rdquo; Yes, she acknowledged, most Indian companies 
</p>
<p>would have paid the bribe, but ZHL was changing Indian society, and it was part of 
</p>
<p>a movement that was gaining momentum. &ldquo;This is who we are,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Be 
</p>
<p>patient and contact the bank.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>With that, she returned to her office, now worried that Rafati might resign.
</p>
<p> Background
</p>
<p>With a population of over 1.2 billion, India was the world&rsquo;s largest democracy, with 
</p>
<p>a 2011 (est.) GDP of $1.676 trillion.3 It ranked 95th on the Transparency International 
</p>
<p>Corruption Perceptions Index in 2011, behind Albania, Rwanda and Columbia (see 
</p>
<p>Exhibit 10.1). According to Transparency International, $US19 billion in illicit pay-
</p>
<p>ments were transferred outside the country each year. To receive basic services such 
</p>
<p>as a telephone, a water supply or a driver&rsquo;s licence, 54% of households expected to 
</p>
<p>pay a bribe in any 12-month period.4 India&rsquo;s bloated and inefficient bureaucracy 
</p>
<p>routinely solicited bribes and extorted payments from businesses just to maintain 
</p>
<p>their everyday operations. On average, it took over 1000&nbsp; days for a contract to 
</p>
<p>become recognized as legally binding. Many petty bureaucrats regarded these pay-
</p>
<p>offs as a supplement to their meager incomes, which barely kept pace with the cost 
</p>
<p>2 1000 INR = $22.54 = 16.21&euro; (October 2010).

<p>of living. Over 25% of all Indian politicians, it was reported, were under investiga-
</p>
<p>tion for corrupt practices. Corruption was so much a part of the economic and social 
</p>
<p>fabric that many doubted it would ever be rooted out&nbsp;&ndash; it was just part of the cost of 
</p>
<p>doing business which no one questioned or challenged.5
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a movement of Indian citizens had begun to chip away at the prob-
</p>
<p>lem. Not only were grassroots protests gaining international recognition&nbsp;&ndash; including 
</p>
<p>a series of hunger strikes by anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare&nbsp;&ndash; but citizens and 
</p>
<p>companies were increasingly using legal channels to further their demands. In polls, 
</p>
<p>75% of respondents indicated that they would support anti-corruption activities.6 A 
</p>
<p>notable initiative, &ldquo;Integrity Pacts&rdquo;, required signatories to refrain from bribery or 
</p>
<p>collusion in their dealings with public bodies. It was one of many underway.7 
</p>
<p>Another resource was the website ipaidabribe.com, which offered information on 
</p>
<p>bribes and corruption as well as a reporting mechanism to publicly document the 
</p>
<p>circumstances in which a bribe was solicited or paid.8
</p>
<p> ZHL
</p>
<p>Founded in 2002 with a single ambulance, ZHL was created to respond to a pressing 
</p>
<p>social need: the lack of a consistently high-quality ambulance service in India. 
</p>
<p>Emergency forms of transport were available from an unwieldy combination of 
</p>
<p>private companies, government bodies, non-governmental organizations and chari-
</p>
<p>table groups. As a result, the death toll in India from acute illnesses, accidents and 
</p>
<p>natural disasters was unusually high.
</p>
<p>ZHL&rsquo;s founders&nbsp;&ndash; Ravi Krishna, Naresh Jain, Manish Sancheti, Sweta Mangal 
</p>
<p>and Shaffi Mather&nbsp;&ndash; had left highly-paid private sector jobs in the US and India in 
</p>
<p>order to become social entrepreneurs in health provision (see Exhibit 10.2). ZHL&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>founders were committed to creating a new kind of organization for India, and 
</p>
<p>indeed for the developing world. According to the ZHL website9:
</p>
<p>The name Ziqitza was derived from the Sanskrit word &lsquo;chikitsa&rsquo;, meaning medical treat-
</p>
<p>ment, and &lsquo;zigyasa&rsquo;, meaning quest for knowledge. Even our brand philosophy is based on 
</p>
<p>the thought of Mahatma Gandhi that &ldquo;Saving a life is one of the most rewarding experi-
</p>
<p>ences a person can undergo in his/her lifetime.
</p>
<p>They chose to focus on ambulance services largely because of a personal experi-
</p>
<p>ence in founder Shaffi Mather&rsquo;s family: his mother had woken in the middle of the 
</p>
<p>night, choking, and he had not known what to do or who to call for help. She had 
</p>
<p>survived, but he was shaken. Fellow-founder Ravi Krishna was able to obtain

</p>
<p>emergency care for his mother within minutes of her collapsing in Manhattan dur-
</p>
<p>ing one of their US visits. The difference, they realized, was the 911 Emergency 
</p>
<p>Medical Services (EMS) there.
</p>
<p>They first came up with a model for the company based on Krishna&rsquo;s experience 
</p>
<p>with 911. Services would include basic and advanced life support, administered by 
</p>
<p>paramedics, and transportation to hospital for both non-emergency and accident/
</p>
<p>disaster victims. Needs were acute and growing, not least given India&rsquo;s unusually 
</p>
<p>high rates of road accidents (16 per 1000 vehicles, compared to a world average of 
</p>
<p>0.75 per 1000), diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and disasters both natural and 
</p>
<p>man-made. Of accidents of fatal consequence, 20% occurred at the site of the acci-
</p>
<p>dent due to injuries, 30% of fatalities were due to transportation delays, and 50% 
</p>
<p>died in hospital due to infection or systems failure.10
</p>
<p>Unlike other service providers, ZHL&rsquo;s business model would combine profit 
</p>
<p>making with social goals. On the one hand, it would offer a &ldquo;private pay&rdquo; ambulance 
</p>
<p>service based on a sliding scale, depending on ability to pay and the type of hospital 
</p>
<p>(private/government) to which patients went. Approximately 20% of patients would 
</p>
<p>receive subsidized rates. On the other hand, in public-private partnerships with state 
</p>
<p>governments, a generally free-of-charge service would be made available to anyone 
</p>
<p>in need. The goal was to begin with services in Mumbai and gradually expand to all 
</p>
<p>of India. In accordance with the founders&rsquo; vision, the company would be accessible 
</p>
<p>to all regardless of income, made financially sustainable by its work, and provide a 
</p>
<p>model of a world-class ambulance service for the developing world. An additional 
</p>
<p>source of revenue would be advertising on the ambulances themselves.11 (See 
</p>
<p>Exhibits 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5).
</p>
<p>In a departure from standard practice in India, ZHL&rsquo;s founders pledged to cate-
</p>
<p>gorically refuse to engage in bribery and other corrupt practices, opting instead for 
</p>
<p>complete transparency. Corruption, in their view, had a symbiotic relationship with 
</p>
<p>poverty, perpetuating exploitive practices and undermining fundamental societal 
</p>
<p>values. Not only would this position form an integral part of the ZHL brand, it 
</p>
<p>should underpin the everyday decisions of all its employees. Knowing this would be 
</p>
<p>extremely challenging, the founders took the unprecedented step of setting up an 
</p>
<p>in-house legal team, an expensive but essential initiative.
</p>
<p> Growing Pains and&nbsp;Gains
</p>
<p>From the start, ZHL encountered the traditional difficulties related to corruption. 
</p>
<p>When the founders wanted to acquire an easy-to-remember four-digit phone num-
</p>
<p>ber for an emergency service (1299), a bureaucrat demanded a bribe. Their categori-
</p>
<p>cal refusal surprised him but they could not get him to budge. Eventually, they chose 
</p>
<p>the less memorable 1298 for their dial-in pay service. It was to become the identify-
</p>
<p>ing brand name of the company. In addition, the 108 dial-in service would serve for

</p>
<p>public-private partnerships in which ZHL cooperated in an official capacity with the 
</p>
<p>state authorities (as in Rafati&rsquo;s &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; state). Technical expertise and train-
</p>
<p>ing was provided by the London Ambulance Service, a strategic partner and the 
</p>
<p>largest metropolitan emergency ambulance service in the world to provide an 
</p>
<p>Emergency Medical Service that was free to patients at the time they received it.
</p>
<p>Once the company was up and running, the emergency services concept proved 
</p>
<p>popular in Mumbai. From 2005 to 2007, ZHL added 22 ambulances to its fleet, 
</p>
<p>answering the needs of over 43,000 patients under the Dial 1298 for Ambulance 
</p>
<p>model. The revenue model worked well, attracting international investors for the 
</p>
<p>first time.12 However, corruption issues persisted with the government, as Sweta 
</p>
<p>Mangal explained:
</p>
<p>They accuse us of providing bad services, and then ask for payment to &lsquo;mitigate&rsquo; the prob-
</p>
<p>lem&hellip;We refuse to take this route&hellip; Word of our reputation travels by mouth. We serve as an 
</p>
<p>example that a company can operate corruption-free.
</p>
<p>Even more important, she and the other leaders at the company held regular 
</p>
<p>meetings to explain what they were doing and why to ZHL employees. &ldquo;We con-
</p>
<p>tinually work to create an ethical corporate culture. Employees believe in our val-
</p>
<p>ues. Job candidates even seek us out because of them,&rdquo; she said. While ZHL paid 
</p>
<p>relatively competitive salaries, she emphasized, that was not the only reason that 
</p>
<p>their employees wanted to work there.
</p>
<p>Thanks to its reputation for competence as well as incorruptibility, ZHL gained 
</p>
<p>the attention of the Acumen Fund, an investment group which was attempting to 
</p>
<p>steer a middle way between dependency-creating charities and market solutions that 
</p>
<p>often ignored &ldquo;bottom of the pyramid&rdquo; business models. It sought to enable social 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurs to challenge traditional development paradigms. As a &ldquo;patient&rdquo; or 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;philanthropic&rdquo; capital investment group, Acumen&rsquo;s hallmarks included:
</p>
<p>&bull; Long-term horizons
</p>
<p>&bull; Tolerance for risk
</p>
<p>&bull; An end goal of maximizing social rather than exclusively financial returns
</p>
<p>&bull; The provision of management support to enable innovative business models to 
</p>
<p>thrive
</p>
<p>&bull; Flexibility regarding partnerships between governments and corporations in the 
</p>
<p>service of low-income customers.13
</p>
<p>After careful due diligence and discussion with the founders, the Acumen Fund 
</p>
<p>agreed to make an initial investment of $US1.5 million in 2007. This set the stage 
</p>
<p>for ZHL&rsquo;s explosive expansion, not only of its ambulance fleet in Mumbai, but for it 
</p>
<p>to begin operations in other states (see Exhibit 10.6). As part of the funding deal,

</p>
<p>Acumen also provided cutting-edge support in the form of advice. It regularly sent 
</p>
<p>executives to work with ZHL on location in Mumbai.
</p>
<p> Major Player, Minor Players
</p>
<p>ZHL&rsquo;s fleet of ambulances expanded rapidly from a few dozen to over 860 by the 
</p>
<p>end of 2011. Meanwhile, headaches with people expecting bribes&nbsp;&ndash; both high offi-
</p>
<p>cials and petty bureaucrats&nbsp;&ndash; multiplied concomitantly with its new responsibilities 
</p>
<p>and obligations, as Ms. Mangal recalled:
</p>
<p>Always looking for a payout, they found all sorts of new ways to harass us. They demanded 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;a, b, and c&rsquo; right away, even though they were slow to process our demands on their end, 
</p>
<p>and when we delivered, they said now they needed &lsquo;d, e, and f&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s always different and 
</p>
<p>always the same. But we would never choose to go down the road of bribes or opacity.
</p>
<p>For example, after the Mumbai terror attacks, officials re-interpreted the law that 
</p>
<p>regulated working hours and then threatened legal action against ZHL, requesting a 
</p>
<p>bribe to drop the case. This led to a long and costly legal dispute.
</p>
<p>In 2008, ZHL&rsquo;s founders worked relentlessly to open up state ambulance con-
</p>
<p>tracts to open tender and to bring transparency to the public-private partnership 
</p>
<p>tenders for EMS in India. It also helped to catapult Mather and the other founders 
</p>
<p>beyond the national spotlight, where they had been tirelessly advocating an end to 
</p>
<p>corruption for nearly a decade, and onto the international stage, such as with a TED 
</p>
<p>(Technology Entertainment Design) talk by Shaffi Mather in December 2009. Their 
</p>
<p>awards included (also see Exhibit 10.7):

</p>
<p> The Decision
</p>
<p>In spite of the worried look on Sanjay Rafati&rsquo;s face, Sweta Mangal was resolute in 
</p>
<p>her decision to refuse to bribe the official to release the payment owed to ZHL.&nbsp;Her 
</p>
<p>response would, she believed, send the right message to her employees&nbsp;&ndash; it would 
</p>
<p>not just maintain but reinforce ZHL&rsquo;s corporate culture.
</p>
<p>For his part, Rafati was concerned that the payment delay would undermine the 
</p>
<p>position he had just taken up in the ZHL office in this problematic state, as well as 
</p>
<p>the nascent culture of the new office. ZHL had, he acknowledged, come very far, 
</p>
<p>very fast. Perhaps it was time to compromise for the sake of receiving payment. He 
</p>
<p>also knew that people had died in India fighting corruption, such as Satyendra 
</p>
<p>Dubey, a project director at the National Highways Authority of India who was 
</p>
<p>murdered in 2003 after exposing corruption in a highway construction project, and 
</p>
<p>Shanmugam Manjunath, murdered in 2005 for sealing a petrol station selling adul-
</p>
<p>terated fuel.14
</p>
<p>Besides, he reasoned, paying the bribe made economic sense: he stood to save a 
</p>
<p>full 10&nbsp;% on the loan option, which could be used to keep people employed, to 
</p>
<p>finance maintenance on the new fleet&nbsp;&ndash; saving money in the long run&nbsp;&ndash; and to retain 
</p>
<p>the employees that he was hiring and training at great cost. The state official seem-
</p>
<p>ingly could delay payment indefinitely. Surely paying was necessary for survival if 
</p>
<p>not more profitable? In the end, how much difference would such a small compro-
</p>
<p>mise make? Hadn&rsquo;t India just fallen on Transparency International&rsquo;s corruption 
</p>
<p>index, from 87th to 95th&nbsp;&ndash; 20 places behind China which ranked 75th.

<p>Part III
</p>
<p>Introduction: Stakeholder Management&nbsp;&ndash; 
Managing Competitiveness and Trust
</p>
<p>Gilbert&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Lenssen 
</p>
<p>This third level of analysis of sustainable business focuses on finding a balance 
</p>
<p>between assertive competitive strategy on one hand and on the other hand the devel-
</p>
<p>opment of social capital to underpin this strategy by building trust, credibility and 
</p>
<p>legitimacy in the firm&rsquo;s relationships with all stakeholders, i.e. those groups and 
</p>
<p>individuals who can affect or be affected by the business. Investing in these relation-
</p>
<p>ships is therefore key to sustained competitive advantage. Stakeholders have an 
</p>
<p>important place in the business model and investing in stakeholder relationships can 
</p>
<p>thus amount to investing in the business model.
</p>
<p>Proper stakeholder management considers both resource base stakeholders (inves-
</p>
<p>tors, customers, employees) and industry structure stakeholders (suppliers, unions, 
</p>
<p>joint venture partners, regulatory bodies) But social-institutional stakeholders such as 
</p>
<p>governments, NGO&rsquo;s, unions, local community organisations and media stakeholders 
</p>
<p>should also be given attention.
</p>
<p>Stakeholders are sources of relational risk and opportunity, as well as sources of 
</p>
<p>information, so effective stakeholder management considers both maximising 
</p>
<p>opportunities (including access to information) as well as mitigating risks.
</p>
<p>However, not all stakeholders have equal importance in the business strategy or 
</p>
<p>in the business model. Stakeholders need to be identified, prioritised and weighed 
</p>
<p>according to their importance for a particular strategy, e.g. for a geographical expan-
</p>
<p>sion strategy into China: the government is a key stakeholder as well as government 
</p>
<p>sponsored NGO&rsquo;s. In knowledge-based industries like ICT, employees as knowl-
</p>
<p>edge carriers have a greater importance in the business model compared to, say, 
</p>
<p>capital intensive businesses like oil companies, where NGO&rsquo;s, for example, are 
</p>
<p>likely more important because of the environmental and social impacts of the busi-
</p>
<p>ness model.
</p>
<p>Key Questions to Ask (Applicable to All Part III Cases)
</p>
<p>What is the business model of the firm?
</p>
<p>Which stakeholders are key in this business model in order of value? (prioritise 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in terms of power and materiality).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>210
</p>
<p>Which stakeholders need to be involved at which stage of the strategy process (from 
</p>
<p>strategy generation to strategy implementation?
</p>
<p>How should the company manage relationships with key stakeholders?
</p>
<p>How can one link sustainability risks and issues to stakeholders, identify opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties and threats?
</p>
<p>Chapter 11: How GAP Engaged with Its Stakeholders by N.&nbsp;Craig Smith, 
</p>
<p>Sean Ansett and Lior Erez
</p>
<p>The Gap case is similar to the Nike case (see Chap. 8) in certain respects. It deals 
</p>
<p>with labour rights and child labour in the supply chain. Both companies failed with 
</p>
<p>a compliance driven approach. But while Nike adapted the business model straight-
</p>
<p>forwardly and looked for industry sector solutions, GAP took an extensive strategic 
</p>
<p>stakeholder engagement approach. Collaboratively identifying the material issues 
</p>
<p>with stakeholders, defining objectives and commonly deciding actions gives solu-
</p>
<p>tions more credibility and facilitates better implementation of decisions. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>this approach allows for establishing and embedding long-term relationships with 
</p>
<p>stakeholders for mutual advantage. The authors present a step-by-step approach to 
</p>
<p>developing strategic stakeholder engagement.
</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Barrick Gold, a Perfect Storm at Pascua Lama by N.&nbsp;Craig 
</p>
<p>Smith and Erin McCormick
</p>
<p>Barrick Gold Corporation practised successfully a stakeholder engagement policy 
</p>
<p>since its founding in 1980. However, the requirements for effective stakeholder 
</p>
<p>management need constantly to be adapted to changing circumstances in the regula-
</p>
<p>tory, financial, environmental and social environment of mining. Entering new 
</p>
<p>geographies like Latin America, with different social contracts requires a careful 
</p>
<p>review of whether the stakeholder policies of old will sufficiently guarantee contin-
</p>
<p>ued success in the new context. Even a business built on strong stakeholder policies 
</p>
<p>of &ldquo;responsible mining&rdquo; can get it wrong with the very stakeholders it pledges to 
</p>
<p>give careful attention.
</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Walmart: Love, Earth (A) by N.&nbsp;Craig Smith and Robert 
</p>
<p>J.&nbsp;Crawford
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s business model based on low costs in the supply chain and a market posi-
</p>
<p>tioning of &ldquo;low prices every day&rdquo; drives the business to centralise and standardise 
</p>
<p>activities and exert rigid control on all business processes. Walmart became the 
</p>
<p>largest corporation and the biggest employer in the world. As a result, the company 
</p>
<p>acquired considerable power over many of its stakeholders. The temptation to use 
</p>
<p>this power over suppliers, employees and partners to reduce costs even further was 
</p>
<p>not resisted, sometimes resulting in exploitative practices. Walmart found itself in a 
</p>
<p>number of controversies with its stakeholders and from 2005 onwards decided to 
</p>
<p>respond differently with a strategic stakeholder management approach. This case

</p>
<p>explores Love Earth, the sustainable jewellery product line of Walmart, from a dual 
</p>
<p>perspective&mdash;that of the company as well as that of NGOs. It offers a model for 
</p>
<p>NGO-business engagement, with a complex multi-stakeholder approach.
</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Shell Nigeria: Changing the Community Engagement Model by 
</p>
<p>Onajomo Akemu, Alexandra Mes, and Lauren Comiteau
</p>
<p>Chapter 10 illustrated how Shell got into serious problems in the Niger Delta by 
</p>
<p>spectacularly underestimating the costs of its social and environmental impacts. 
</p>
<p>These costs, alongside the unfavourable deal it made with the government, rendered 
</p>
<p>the investment far below the profitability levels once assumed. At the core of its 
</p>
<p>problems was the lack of support of local communities, complicated by an environ-
</p>
<p>ment of civil unrest and abuse of human rights. Massive oil spills with disastrous 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts were largely due to theft from the pipelines that stretched 
</p>
<p>over hundreds of miles from the Niger Delta to the coastal ports. Shell tackled the 
</p>
<p>problem, albeit belatedly, with a new community engagement programme, as 
</p>
<p>described here. Ultimately, however, it was forced to disinvest from the Niger Delta 
</p>
<p>in 2013 as it could not gain control over the pipeline thefts which continued to cause 
</p>
<p>considerable environmental damage.
</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Economy of Mutuality: Equipping the Executive Mindset for 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Business by Kevin T.&nbsp;Jackson
</p>
<p>The economy of mutuality is a philosophy with supporting evidence such as the 
</p>
<p>book, Firms of Endearment, a survey of firms which invested in long-term relation-
</p>
<p>ships with stakeholders and society at large and which in the long term generated 
</p>
<p>superior financial returns compared to the S&amp;P 500. Companies like Johnson &amp; 
</p>
<p>Johnson (since 1943), Mars (since 1947), and Novartis (since 1989) have used an 
</p>
<p>explicit stakeholder model in their management systems for many years. But these 
</p>
<p>surveys, the latest published in 2014, suggest that many companies have an implicit 
</p>
<p>stakeholder model, which serves them very well. The success of Amazon, UPS, 
</p>
<p>Colgate Palmolive, BMW, IKEA, and General Electric can be explained in part by 
</p>
<p>this approach. Investing in mutually beneficial relationships with stakeholders is a 
</p>
<p>long-term project that should be driven by passion and purpose. The surveys show 
</p>
<p>that these companies have smart, no-nonsense business models, but equally have an 
</p>
<p>emotional commitment to the stakeholder relationships.

<p>11How GAP Engaged with&nbsp;Its Stakeholders
N. Craig&nbsp;Smith, Sean&nbsp;Ansett, and&nbsp;Lior&nbsp;Erez
</p>
<p>The pictures that came out of the southern African mountain kingdom of Lesotho in 
</p>
<p>August 2009 were truly disturbing. A reporter from the London Sunday Times had 
</p>
<p>found that a contractor to leading apparel brands, including Gap Inc., had allegedly 
</p>
<p>dumped toxic materials into local landfills.1
</p>
<p>Poor local children, some as young as five, had reportedly found razors and 
</p>
<p>harmful chemicals while scavenging through burning refuse piles. &ldquo;We itch all day 
</p>
<p>and some of the sacks used to dispose the chemicals have powder that makes our 
</p>
<p>hands and arms burn,&rdquo; said one girl. Some children suffered from breathing prob-
</p>
<p>lems, rashes and watery eyes. A subsequent CBS broadcast added a further, vivid 
</p>
<p>twist: the contractor&rsquo;s discharge of garment dyes and other contaminants into the 
</p>
<p>nearby Caledon River had turned the water indigo blue, making it hazardous for 
</p>
<p>local inhabitants. All in all, it was a brand manager&rsquo;s nightmare&nbsp;&ndash; particularly in a 
</p>
<p>world of instantaneous communication.
</p>
<p>A similar crisis 10&nbsp;years before had led to global protests that went on for months, 
</p>
<p>at considerable cost to the San Francisco-based company, employee morale and even 
</p>
<p>the child-workers themselves. However, this time the Gap responded swiftly and pro-
</p>
<p>actively to take steps to address the problems, and the Lesotho story soon died down.

</p>
<p>What had changed? In the intervening decade, the Gap had cultivated close rela-
</p>
<p>tionships with labor groups, human rights organizations, governments and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders through sustained and action-oriented engagement&nbsp;&ndash; a long, hard pro-
</p>
<p>cess that had transformed a brand associated with sweatshops and child labor into a 
</p>
<p>company recognized for corporate social responsibility,2 the kind of organization 
</p>
<p>that people were willing to give the benefit of the doubt.
</p>
<p>Gap&rsquo;s stakeholder engagement strategy transformed the way Gap approached 
</p>
<p>inevitable ethical trading problems. However, the change did not happen overnight. 
</p>
<p>Instead, management learned a number of key lessons over time that could be help-
</p>
<p>ful to other brands that struggle with ethical trading concerns. In this article, based 
</p>
<p>on in-depth interviews conducted with Gap management and key external stake-
</p>
<p>holder representatives during the second half of 2009, we describe how Gap devel-
</p>
<p>oped its stakeholder engagement strategy, the work such a shift entails, and the 
</p>
<p>many ways in which stakeholder engagement has benefited the company.
</p>
<p> Why Stakeholder Engagement?
</p>
<p>In the last three decades, corporate attitudes toward social responsibility have 
</p>
<p>evolved well beyond the dictum that &ldquo;the business of business is business&rdquo;3 toward 
</p>
<p>a more nuanced view that business and society are inextricably linked. Now, many 
</p>
<p>theorists urge management to take into consideration not only shareholders&rsquo; inter-
</p>
<p>ests, but also those of other groups, organizations and individuals who have a stake 
</p>
<p>in the company. They argue that a company&rsquo;s failure to understand the needs of this 
</p>
<p>wider group of stakeholders can create dangerous &ldquo;blind spots&rdquo; for managers&nbsp;&ndash; and 
</p>
<p>conversely, that greater understanding and closer ties to stakeholders can create sus-
</p>
<p>tainable value, both for the company and its stakeholders.4
</p>
<p>Stakeholders, to use a definition put forward in 1984 by R.&nbsp;Edward Freeman, are 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of an 
</p>
<p>organization&rsquo;s purpose,&rdquo; principally financiers, customers, suppliers, employees 
</p>
<p>and communities.5 Freeman argued that such stakeholders can have a significant 
</p>
<p>2 For example, Gap was recognized as one of the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Most Ethical Companies&rdquo; in the 2010 
Ethisphere ranking (across 35 industries there were 99 total companies and only 9 retailers on this 
list); Gap was ranked number 11 overall and number 3 on human rights in Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) magazine&rsquo;s &ldquo;100 Best Corporate Citizens 2011&rdquo; (out of 1,000 companies evaluated).

September 13, 1970.

</p>
<p>impact on business success, well beyond their role as factors of production or con-
</p>
<p>sumption. The basic premise of stakeholder theory is that management should not 
</p>
<p>relegate the company&rsquo;s effects on stakeholders to the status of &ldquo;externalities&rdquo; that 
</p>
<p>are irrelevant to the company&rsquo;s objective of creating shareholder value, but should 
</p>
<p>view stakeholders as key to the company&rsquo;s financial performance as well as holding 
</p>
<p>intrinsic value of their own.6 In fact, a stakeholder engagement program won&rsquo;t work 
</p>
<p>very well even on the limited level of corporate self-interest if this is not recognized 
</p>
<p>and employees simply go through the motions.
</p>
<p>As Gap&rsquo;s experience suggests, stakeholder engagement is not easy. (See &ldquo;Lessons 
</p>
<p>from the Gap Experience.&rdquo;) It requires careful listening and even more careful 
</p>
<p>action on the part of management, including patient relationship-building with civil 
</p>
<p>society, multilateral groups and global trade unions. It is often expensive and slow. 
</p>
<p>However, stakeholder engagement can contribute to a company&rsquo;s economic perfor-
</p>
<p>mance by enabling the company to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Resolve complex problems. Stakeholders can enhance a company&rsquo;s perspective 
</p>
<p>on issues and solutions that companies might not have access to on their own, 
</p>
<p>including understanding of the local context. In fact, some problems are so com-
</p>
<p>plex they can&rsquo;t be resolved without the collaboration, knowledge, networks and 
</p>
<p>expertise of stakeholders.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce headline risk. Stakeholders familiar with operations can often uncover 
</p>
<p>situations where supply chain partners are not acting in ways consistent with 
</p>
<p>company policies, giving the company an early warning about emerging chal-
</p>
<p>lenges and the opportunity to proactively address them before the issue reaches 
</p>
<p>the media.
</p>
<p>&bull; Boost stakeholder trust. Closer communication tends to make the relationship 
</p>
<p>with stakeholders more cooperative and less confrontational once respect has 
</p>
<p>been earned.
</p>
<p>&bull; Enhance political clout. Companies working with stakeholders to shape industry 
</p>
<p>standards often gain greater access to reformist politicians and regulators, thereby 
</p>
<p>increasing the likelihood that their concerns are taken into consideration in the 
</p>
<p>formulation of legislation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Improve the company&rsquo;s public image. Successful stakeholder engagement is 
</p>
<p>likely to contribute to a positive view of the company in the eyes of all of its 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including its customers and employees. Some evidence even sug-
</p>
<p>gests that a responsible image is beneficial for employee recruitment and reten-
</p>
<p>tion as well as customer preference.

<p>11 How GAP Engaged with&nbsp;Its Stakeholders</p>

</p>
<p>Exhibit 1: Lessons from the Gap Experience
</p>
<p>By engaging its stakeholders rather than simply trying to deflect criticism, Gap 
</p>
<p>found it could overcome supply chain disasters, such as revelations regarding child 
</p>
<p>labor, much more easily and resolve the crises in ways that were better for victims 
</p>
<p>and the company. What are some key lessons from Gap&rsquo;s experience?
</p>
<p>&bull; Be a partner.
</p>
<p>The traditional reactive, risk-avoidance approach to labor and environmental 
</p>
<p>issues leads to more activism, weakening the brand and draining employee morale. 
</p>
<p>Acting as a partner with stakeholders can lead to better crisis resolution and reme-
</p>
<p>diation and help prevent more crises from developing in the first place.
</p>
<p>&bull; Forget Band-aids.
</p>
<p>Labor and environmental crises are nearly inevitable for high-profile companies 
</p>
<p>with complex global supply chains. However, a strategy of engagement can help a 
</p>
<p>company minimize their frequency (by making it possible to eliminate sources of 
</p>
<p>risks early), and severity (by giving the company more credibility with NGOs).
</p>
<p>&bull; Don&rsquo;t rely solely on compliance.
</p>
<p>Through stakeholder engagement, Gap management realized that the future was 
</p>
<p>not in solely policing factories. It learned that savvier and influential stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>many with years of practical experience observing conditions in the factories, had 
</p>
<p>come to realize that the impact of monitoring was often negligible and that capacity- 
</p>
<p>building, training and purchasing practices are also key factors. Much of the infor-
</p>
<p>mation regarding serious violations often came from external stakeholders rather 
</p>
<p>than through internal factory auditing, so engagement was critical.
</p>
<p>&bull; Go deep.
</p>
<p>Today, when media report labor rights violations such as the India child labor 
</p>
<p>example, they typically find them in the second-tier suppliers or beyond, where 
</p>
<p>there is less oversight and sophistication than in first-tier suppliers for major fashion 
</p>
<p>companies. Reaching deeper into the supply chain requires collaboration with new 
</p>
<p>stakeholders who have greater understanding, including familiarity with local lan-
</p>
<p>guages, and the capacity to take on an advisory role.
</p>
<p>&bull; Hire boundary spanners.
</p>
<p>Gap created a strategic unit called Global Partnerships, a team that could assume 
</p>
<p>a &ldquo;boundary spanner role&rdquo; within the company. Such &ldquo;boundary spanners&rdquo; are pro-
</p>
<p>fessionals who are good at maintaining one foot firmly in the organization with the 
</p>
<p>other outside in the stakeholder community.
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>217
</p>
<p>&bull; Leverage your partners.
</p>
<p>Sustainability dilemmas are often far too complex for any one company or stake-
</p>
<p>holder to resolve alone. Developing sustainable approaches to tackling some of the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s most challenging issues&nbsp; &ndash; such as climate change&nbsp; &ndash; will require multi- 
</p>
<p>stakeholder partnerships with companies, NGOs and governments.
</p>
<p>&bull; Measure success
</p>
<p>Criteria for evaluating the depth of stakeholder engagement generally evaluate 
</p>
<p>management processes and procedures. While such measures are critical to engage-
</p>
<p>ment, management should also look at metrics such as media stories, employee 
</p>
<p>recruitment and retention and brand value. Other clues to effective stakeholder 
</p>
<p>engagement include product quality, worker turnover, and declining order reject 
</p>
<p>rates.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ask first.
</p>
<p>Engagement can be most effective when the company is considering changes to 
</p>
<p>products, processes or organizational strategies. Input from a variety of stakeholders 
</p>
<p>enables management to have a fuller picture of risks and opportunities.
</p>
<p> The Gap Story
</p>
<p>Gap&rsquo;s commitment to social responsibility was evident as early as 1992, when it pub-
</p>
<p>lished one of the earliest set of sourcing principles and shared this with vendors in the 
</p>
<p>garment industry. In 1996, Gap developed a code of vendor conduct and made it pub-
</p>
<p>lic. Gap&rsquo;s code covered labor, environmental, and health and safety standards through-
</p>
<p>out the company&rsquo;s first-tier suppliers and their subcontractors in its global supply 
</p>
<p>chain, and relied mostly on the suppliers to implement the code&rsquo;s requirements.
</p>
<p>Despite Gap&rsquo;s efforts, the National Labor Committee (NLC), a workers&rsquo; rights 
</p>
<p>group, exposed serious labor violations in the Mandarin International garment fac-
</p>
<p>tory in El Salvador in 1995, including accounts of low pay, excessive overtime and 
</p>
<p>union-busting. The case was a &ldquo;wake-up call&rdquo; for Gap, which realized that the com-
</p>
<p>pany needed a team of internal auditors to verify that contractors were living by its 
</p>
<p>code of conduct. In 1996, Gap began to assemble a diverse global compliance team 
</p>
<p>which would be responsible for the inspection and the implementation of the code, 
</p>
<p>an experienced group that included former NGO and trade union staff, as well as 
</p>
<p>former journalists, social workers and factory managers.
</p>
<p>But even this team of more than 100 people, operating globally, proved insuffi-
</p>
<p>cient to catch every problem: In 1999, Gap and 26 other US retailers, including 
</p>
<p>Levi&rsquo;s and Nordstrom, were sued over labor conditions in their supplier factories in 
</p>
<p>the U.S.-administered south Pacific island of Saipan. As in El Salvador, the Saipan 
</p>
<p>suit alleged cases of forced labor, nonpayment of minimum wages and other egre-
</p>
<p>gious violations of the rights of the island&rsquo;s mostly migrant workforce. The U.S. 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>218
</p>
<p>retailers eventually agreed to pay a $20 million settlement to the suit and use the 
</p>
<p>funds to establish a labor monitoring program and an oversight board to sustain 
</p>
<p>change. Gap took an additional step and developed the industry&rsquo;s first foreign con-
</p>
<p>tract worker guidelines to formalize its policy and monitoring protocol.
</p>
<p> The Limits of&nbsp;Policing: Cambodia, 2000
</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks in El Salvador and Saipan, Gap still believed it was on the right 
</p>
<p>track and continued to focus on supply chain auditing. Yet a further blow to Gap&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>reputation was still to come: In October 2000, Gap was approached by the BBC 
</p>
<p>with an allegation of child labor in a Phnom Penh factory, in which Gap, among 
</p>
<p>other multinational companies, subcontracted production.
</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the documentary aired, accusing Gap and Nike (who also 
</p>
<p>contracted with the factory) of ignoring the problem of child labor in their factories 
</p>
<p>and of relying on ineffective monitoring systems. The Cambodian factory&rsquo;s man-
</p>
<p>agement denied the accusations, and the Cambodian government declared that its 
</p>
<p>own investigation had cleared the factory of any wrongdoing.7
</p>
<p>Gap, however, felt that there was no definitive way to settle the dispute. Since 
</p>
<p>most documents attesting to age in Cambodia were destroyed by years of war and 
</p>
<p>genocide, Gap and its suppliers relied on family records to verify that workers were 
</p>
<p>above the minimum working age. Yet after examining their &lsquo;family books,&rsquo; Gap 
</p>
<p>investigators still could not confirm the reporter&rsquo;s claim that the workers were 
</p>
<p>underage. Nor could doctors the company consulted verify the workers&rsquo; ages. &ldquo;Even 
</p>
<p>from a medical point of view it was not easy,&rdquo; said Ira Puspadewi, Gap&rsquo;s director of 
</p>
<p>social and community investment in Asia, who at the time was Gap&rsquo;s regional code 
</p>
<p>of conduct compliance officer.
</p>
<p>Following the broadcast, letters flooded Gap&rsquo;s corporate communications and 
</p>
<p>global compliance department. Anti-sweatshop student protestors picketed Gap and 
</p>
<p>Nike outlets, calling for consumers to boycott the stores. Gap issued a statement in 
</p>
<p>response to the strong reaction from NGOs, trade unions and the public, declaring 
</p>
<p>that it did not tolerate underage labor, and asserting that &ldquo;If we discover instances of 
</p>
<p>underage labor, we take swift and appropriate action.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Several brands left Cambodia. Gap, on the other hand, considered the potentially 
</p>
<p>negative impacts to workers if it were to &lsquo;cut and run&rsquo; and decided to stay and work 
</p>
<p>to improve labor conditions in Cambodia, while enhancing the age verification 
</p>
<p>requirements in the factories from which it sourced.
</p>
<p>Gap stayed because experience had shown executives that pulling out can lead to 
</p>
<p>even worse outcomes for child laborers. Perhaps the most notorious example of the 
</p>
<p>consequences of cutting ties with a subcontractor had occurred in the Bangladeshi 
</p>
<p>7 P.&nbsp;Kenyon, &ldquo;Gap and Nike: No Sweat (TV report transcript),&rdquo; BBC, 15th October 2000. See:

October 2000.

</p>
<p>garment industry earlier in the decade. A 1993 NBC broadcast exposed child labor in 
</p>
<p>a Bangladeshi factory supplying Wal-Mart. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers 
</p>
<p>and Exporters Association, threatened by the prospect of U.S. legislation that would 
</p>
<p>close Bangladeshi garments to the American market, announced that it would elimi-
</p>
<p>nate child labor in the country by the end of October 1994. Thousands of children 
</p>
<p>were reportedly dismissed from the factories. But many children dismissed from  
</p>
<p>the textile factories found themselves in worse situations: A 1995 report by British 
</p>
<p>development organization Oxfam revealed that those children ended up in even more 
</p>
<p>dangerous work, such as welding or even prostitution.
</p>
<p>Although Gap executives believed they were taking the high road in staying on 
</p>
<p>in Cambodia, the public damage had still been done. The company&rsquo;s compliance- 
</p>
<p>oriented public statements and lack of connection with its stakeholders meant that 
</p>
<p>Gap&rsquo;s reputation was once again tarnished.
</p>
<p> Implementing Strategic Stakeholder Engagement
</p>
<p>The Cambodian episode was deeply frustrating to Gap executives. Despite fielding 
</p>
<p>a large labor standards monitoring team and investing millions in policing its facto-
</p>
<p>ries, Gap remained under constant pressure from advocacy groups in the U.S. and 
</p>
<p>the U.K.&nbsp;In fact, protests actually intensified as activists perceived that their actions 
</p>
<p>were getting results. Protesters camped out in front of Gap&rsquo;s corporate headquarters 
</p>
<p>in San Francisco for weeks on end, attracting considerable media attention, particu-
</p>
<p>larly when the groups engaged in such stunts as picketing in the nude. Executives 
</p>
<p>realized that Gap&rsquo;s legalistic risk-mitigation approach to ethical trade was &ldquo;broke&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>policing would not bring the change in the supply chain that management desired. 
</p>
<p>Clearly, the way it engaged with its critics needed a major overhaul. In the years that 
</p>
<p>followed the Cambodia case, Gap embarked on a five-step path to deeper engage-
</p>
<p>ment with its stakeholders:
</p>
<p> Step 1. Draw a&nbsp;Stakeholder Map
First, Gap developed a stakeholder map, listing as many stakeholders as possible, 
</p>
<p>and then ranking them by their salience or importance.8 &ldquo;We recognized that it 
</p>
<p>would not be possible for us to have a strategic relationship with each of the stake-
</p>
<p>holders, so we highlighted those who we deemed to be the most key,&rdquo; recalled 
</p>
<p>Deanna Robinson, Gap&rsquo;s head of monitoring and vendor development.
</p>
<p>Prioritizing stakeholders enabled the company to focus on developing transparent 
</p>
<p>relationships with a few of the most influential organizations. &ldquo;We will never be able 
</p>
<p>to engage at the same level of depth with every organization that exists,&rdquo; explained 
</p>
<p>Daryl Knudsen, Gap&rsquo;s director of stakeholder engagement and public policy, &ldquo;but by 
</p>
<p>8 R.&nbsp;K. Mitchell, B.&nbsp;R. Agle and D.&nbsp;J. Wood, &ldquo;Toward a Theory of Stakeholder Identification and 
Salience: Defining the Principle of Who and What Really Counts,&rdquo; Academy of Management 
Review 22, no. 4 (1997): 853&ndash;886.
</p>
<p>11 How GAP Engaged with&nbsp;Its Stakeholders</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>220
</p>
<p>engaging with organizations who themselves have extensive networks, we have man-
</p>
<p>aged to receive some level of input and influence from those networks.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The mapping process at Gap was facilitated by a San Francisco based NGO- 
</p>
<p>cum- consultancy, Business for Social Responsibility (BSR). The stakeholder map-
</p>
<p>ping session included participants from various functional areas of the business 
</p>
<p>including legal, public relations, government affairs and global compliance. The 
</p>
<p>session not only produced a map of stakeholders prioritized by customized criteria 
</p>
<p>developed by the team, but also served as a learning opportunity for internal team 
</p>
<p>members to understand the key stakeholders, the proposed strategy and the value of 
</p>
<p>engagement. The mapping exercise helped educate Gap executives about the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s many relationships and the impact the company had on thousands of lives.
</p>
<p>Through this exercise Gap was beginning to evolve its approach from a risk- averse 
</p>
<p>legalistic strategy to one based on proactive engagement that could tease out stake-
</p>
<p>holder needs, positions and motivations. This stakeholder approach was a huge shift for 
</p>
<p>the company and many of the senior decision makers in the room were learning about 
</p>
<p>stakeholder theory and discovering who these stakeholders were for the first time.
</p>
<p>In 2002, once Gap had identified its key stakeholders, Gap began to meet with 
</p>
<p>them to get their advice on how to improve its labor practices. One meeting in par-
</p>
<p>ticular was to have important consequences for the company. Company executives 
</p>
<p>met Lynda Yanz, of the Maquiladora Solidarity Network (MSN) in Toronto, Canada. 
</p>
<p>MSN is an influential worker rights group concerned with labor rights issues in the 
</p>
<p>Americas&nbsp;&ndash; a key sourcing market for the company. Gap managers emerged from 
</p>
<p>the meeting believing they were mistaken in trying to &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo; in their efforts to 
</p>
<p>improve labor conditions. The team became convinced they should consider devel-
</p>
<p>oping partnerships with relevant stakeholders and consider joining the emerging 
</p>
<p>multi-stakeholder initiatives.
</p>
<p>On Yanz&rsquo;s advice, Gap began to engage stakeholders more holistically and stake-
</p>
<p>holders began to communicate about emerging issues directly with corporate 
</p>
<p>responsibility team members. Beyond engaging MSN, Gap also joined two multi- 
</p>
<p>stakeholder initiatives: the New&nbsp; York-based Social Accountability International 
</p>
<p>(SAI) in 2003 and the London-based Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) in 2004. 
</p>
<p>Executives say joining these MSIs provided the company with a safe forum to dis-
</p>
<p>cuss its challenges with various stakeholders and to gain their insights and perspec-
</p>
<p>tives on the best ways to handle particular issues.
</p>
<p> Step 2. Identify the&nbsp;Material Issues
Next, Gap identified the most important social issues the company and its stake-
</p>
<p>holders faced. &ldquo;We examine what our core impacts are, and we try to stay apprised 
</p>
<p>of key issues in those areas and procure opportunities where Gap&rsquo;s contribution will 
</p>
<p>make a difference,&rdquo; explained Knudsen.
</p>
<p>After identifying the issues, Gap gauged their maturity. If there was weak evi-
</p>
<p>dence and little awareness for an issue, it was considered &ldquo;latent.&rdquo; If it had become 
</p>
<p>the focus of NGO campaigning and research, the issue was classified as &ldquo;emerging.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>If awareness for the issue went beyond the professional community to the public 
</p>
<p>and media and there existed a strong body of evidence in support, it was 
</p>
<p>N. Craig&nbsp;Smith et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>221
</p>
<p>&ldquo;consolidating.&rdquo; Finally, an issue was &ldquo;institutionalized&rdquo; when its handling had 
</p>
<p>become a normal part of regulations and business practice.9 Two &ldquo;consolidating&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>priorities that emerged from that work: Child labor (not surprisingly, in view of the 
</p>
<p>past controversy in Cambodia), and HIV/AIDS, a major issue in Lesotho and South 
</p>
<p>Africa, where up to 30&nbsp;% of the population was infected.
</p>
<p> Step 3. Define Objectives
Gap defined its objectives based on stakeholder input through the engagement pro-
</p>
<p>cess with MSN and others. One top priority that emerged: increasing transparency. 
</p>
<p>A major milestone for Gap in this regard was the publication of its first Social 
</p>
<p>Responsibility report in 2004. The &ldquo;warts and all&rdquo; report focused on code of con-
</p>
<p>duct violations regarding labor rights and the supply chain and the measures being 
</p>
<p>taken to prevent future violations. Although some media outlets interpreted the 
</p>
<p>report as an act of contrition (e.g., &ldquo;Gap Admits to Running Sweatshops&rdquo;), some of 
</p>
<p>Gap&rsquo;s toughest critics praised the effort.10
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the SR report is one of our greatest successes,&rdquo; said Dan Henkle, Gap&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>former senior vice president of global responsibility. &ldquo;We really found our voice&hellip;
</p>
<p>sharing information without coming across as public relations and patting yourself 
</p>
<p>on the back.&rdquo; In public relations terms, the report had a very positive effect: The 
</p>
<p>marketing department suggested that the number of &ldquo;positive impressions&rdquo; the 
</p>
<p>report generated may have equaled the equivalent of two Super Bowl advertising 
</p>
<p>campaigns. The report also served as a &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; for others in the industry, 
</p>
<p>particularly those that had not invested in corporate responsibility to date, as many 
</p>
<p>suppliers served multiple brands.
</p>
<p> Step 4. Resolve Issues Collaboratively
Prior to the engagement strategy, stakeholders would send letters to Gap about their 
</p>
<p>concerns regarding factory issues. Corporate communications would usually reply 
</p>
<p>with a &ldquo;canned&rdquo; response, mentioning the code of conduct and the number of inter-
</p>
<p>nal auditors that were working to address noncompliance. This approach typically 
</p>
<p>infuriated stakeholders and increased the likelihood of campaigns against Gap. 
</p>
<p>Gap&rsquo;s Global Partnership team took a different tack and instead told stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>contact it directly if they saw problems emerging.
</p>
<p>Such a tactic paid off in 2005, the year the Multi Fiber Arrangement was phased 
</p>
<p>out. Between 1974 and 2005, the MFA had governed the amount of textiles devel-
</p>
<p>oping countries could export to developed countries. However, although initially 
</p>
<p>intended to limit the rapidity of growth in the market, its country-by-country 
</p>
<p>9 This model, originally developed by pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, is described more 
fully in S.&nbsp;Zadek, &ldquo;The Path to Corporate Responsibility,&rdquo; Harvard Business Review 82, no. 12 
(December 2004): 125&ndash;132.

</p>
<p>allotments also acted to protect the supplier markets as well. At the time, many in 
</p>
<p>the apparel industry believed that once the MFA system was dismantled, China 
</p>
<p>would take over the world&rsquo;s textile market and destroy most of the other emerging 
</p>
<p>market competition. For the Gap, the multi-stakeholder dialogue led to an execu-
</p>
<p>tive commitment to consider the implications of exiting from a country and to 
</p>
<p>address negative impacts on workers and communities in labor markets the com-
</p>
<p>pany decided to exit.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Gap organized a series of stakeholder meetings in both the U.S. and the U.K. to 
</p>
<p>elicit insights about the post-MFA era. The company invited NGOs, academics, gov-
</p>
<p>ernment and trade unions to discuss Gap&rsquo;s program and to identify emerging con-
</p>
<p>cerns. Creating such a forum provided Gap with &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; globally, placing the company 
</p>
<p>in a position to resolve issues in factories &ldquo;below the radar screen,&rdquo; rather than in 
</p>
<p>public. The stakeholder communication served as an informal complaint mechanism 
</p>
<p>on factory problems, enabling the company to respond earlier to emerging issues.
</p>
<p>For example, stakeholder feedback helped Gap identify HIV/AIDS as a key 
</p>
<p>challenge in Lesotho and led the company to join singer/activist Bono&rsquo;s Red cam-
</p>
<p>paign to donate 50&nbsp;% of profits on a particular line of &lsquo;Red&rsquo; branded Gap products 
</p>
<p>and a commitment by Gap to continue to source those products from Lesotho. 
</p>
<p>Through these meetings, Gap also learned that brand demands for supplier flexi-
</p>
<p>bility, such as changes in color or design elements or lead time could have major 
</p>
<p>repercussions for workplace practices. Although identified by Naomi Klein in her 
</p>
<p>2000 book No Logo, this was one of the first times in which a retailer saw that its 
</p>
<p>Through meetings with stakeholders, Gap learned that brand demands for supplier flexibility, such 
as changes in color or design elements, could have major repercussions for workplace practices.

</p>
<p>own practices could have negative consequences on the implementation of its own 
</p>
<p>codes of conduct. This insight led to a purchasing practice pilot project in 2005, 
</p>
<p>ahead of the rest of the industry.11
</p>
<p> Step 5. Embed Engagement
Some Gap stakeholders were resistant to the engagement strategy. A number of 
</p>
<p>employees felt the company was selling out to NGOs. At the same time, some exter-
</p>
<p>nal stakeholders dismissed Gap&rsquo;s efforts as more PR &ldquo;spin.&rdquo; In the beginning, Gap&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>legal department was particularly unsure about the strategy. &ldquo;[Gap] lawyers were 
</p>
<p>extremely sensitive and cautious about anything they would say in public that could 
</p>
<p>open them up for potential litigation. So, even as they developed a highly sophisti-
</p>
<p>cated and significantly resourced compliance system to support their code, they 
</p>
<p>remained defensive, at least in public, about these issues,&rdquo; recalled Bennett Freeman, 
</p>
<p>a consultant at that time with Burston-Marsteller, the public relations agency, which 
</p>
<p>was involved in the stakeholder engagement decision.
</p>
<p>The challenge, according to Lakshmi Bhatia, former director of global partner-
</p>
<p>ships at Gap, was &ldquo;narrowing down the boundaries between our internal organiza-
</p>
<p>tion and the stakeholder world.&rdquo; The team did that in part by hiring &ldquo;boundary 
</p>
<p>spanners,&rdquo; people familiar with the corporate as well as the civil society discourse, 
</p>
<p>who helped mediate between the potential adversaries. &ldquo;The typical corporate 
</p>
<p>mindset is often about very clearly defined structures and boundaries,&rdquo; said Bhatia, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;and that does not work when you are engaging [with stakeholders].&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Nor were boundary-spanning efforts important only in winning over external scep-
</p>
<p>tics. Moving the Global Responsibility team from sourcing to the legal department 
</p>
<p>helped win over company attorneys to the engagement strategy. Managers say that 
</p>
<p>exposure to the Global Responsibility team actually helped change the legal depart-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo;s approach, making the company more open and supportive of the strategy.
</p>
<p> Beyond Crisis Management: India, 2007
</p>
<p>In 2007, Gap&rsquo;s new stakeholder engagement approach was put to the test, as the 
</p>
<p>media exposed another case of child labor in Gap&rsquo;s supply chain. A reporter from 
</p>
<p>The Observer (U.K.) advised Gap&rsquo;s CSR personnel of his discoveries regarding 
</p>
<p>child labor in an Indian embroidery company that produced T-shirts for the GapKids 
</p>
<p>brand.12 Gap investigated the case and discovered that one of its approved suppliers 
</p>
<p>had referred handiwork to the embroidery company, a facility unauthorized by Gap.

<p>11 How GAP Engaged with&nbsp;Its Stakeholders</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>224
</p>
<p>Objectively, this case was much more severe than Cambodia. In 2000, Gap could 
</p>
<p>not verify that the workers in question were in fact underage, whereas in this case 
</p>
<p>there was no doubt about the age of the workers and the severity of the working con-
</p>
<p>ditions. Some of the children had been sold to the sweatshop by their impoverished 
</p>
<p>families as bonded or forced labor. They labored 16&nbsp;h a day without compensation, 
</p>
<p>suffering from severe physical and verbal abuse on the part of their supervisors.
</p>
<p>Thanks to its earlier stakeholder engagement efforts, Gap had more time to form 
</p>
<p>an effective response to the allegations and a holistic approach to remediating the 
</p>
<p>issue than in the Cambodian crisis, according to Deanna Robinson. Rather than 
</p>
<p>arriving completely out of the blue, the news reached Gap earlier, giving the com-
</p>
<p>pany more time to prepare its response. &ldquo;If you fast forward to the case in India, we 
</p>
<p>did have a direct conversation with the reporter, but we also really had more of an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to assess the situation,&rdquo; said Robinson.
</p>
<p>Gap responded swiftly and effectively to the allegations. As soon as the story 
</p>
<p>broke, Gap followed the guidelines it had learned from multiple stakeholders includ-
</p>
<p>ing trade unions and NGOs about how to manage a child labor incident: It took full 
</p>
<p>responsibility, cancelled the product order and barred the unauthorized subcontrac-
</p>
<p>tor from any future involvement with the company. An executive in the business, not 
</p>
<p>a corporate communications or corporate responsibility person, spoke for the com-
</p>
<p>pany. The key message the company wanted to convey was &ldquo;that in the reality of an 
</p>
<p>issue as complex as child labor, clearly no single company can change a societal 
</p>
<p>situation, so it&rsquo;s going to take an industry response,&rdquo; according to Bill Chandler, 
</p>
<p>Gap&rsquo;s vice president of corporate communication.
</p>
<p>After internal debate, the company decided to retain its relationship with the first-
</p>
<p>tier supplier that had hired the embroidery company. The first-tier supplier had a strong 
</p>
<p>reputation for labor compliance, and retaining the company would also preserve local 
</p>
<p>jobs. It also decided that the finished garments would not be sold. A summit meeting 
</p>
<p>with all north Indian suppliers was held in November to reinforce the message of &ldquo;zero 
</p>
<p>tolerance&rdquo; towards child labor and ensuring no unauthorized subcontracting.
</p>
<p>The Indian government, working with a local child labor NGO, BBA (Bachpan 
</p>
<p>Bachao Andolan), managed the initial remedial treatment of the children in question 
</p>
<p>and made sure they were taken care of. Gap started funding BBA to serve as a local 
</p>
<p>educator against child labor. Gap also helped create a global forum of brands and 
</p>
<p>retailers, together with NGOs, trade unions and government officials, to develop 
</p>
<p>industry-wide strategies against child labor.
</p>
<p>Unlike the Cambodian case, which dogged the company for months and spurred 
</p>
<p>storefront protests, the media story about the Indian case was all but &lsquo;dead&rsquo; in a few 
</p>
<p>days. Responses to the incident were substantially different compared to 7&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>before. This time around, the NGOs didn&rsquo;t view Gap as the enemy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d worked 
</p>
<p>with us, found us to be good partners, and therefore, instead, their approach was 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;how can we help?&rsquo;&rdquo; Gap&rsquo;s Henkle recalled.
</p>
<p>NGO and trade union representatives told us that Gap&rsquo;s transparency and respon-
</p>
<p>siveness in the years before the incident prompted them to take a more collaborative 
</p>
<p>approach. &ldquo;There is less criticism from the campaigning community around them,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>said Maggie Burns, a trustee of Women Working Worldwide, a U.K.-based 
</p>
<p>N. Craig&nbsp;Smith et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>225
</p>
<p>organization that works with an international network of women workers. &ldquo;That 
</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that the campaigning community has gone soft on what Gap should 
</p>
<p>do, but I think there is a difference, because they are working with stakeholders in a 
</p>
<p>much more open and transparent way.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Various NGO representatives emphasized to us that this does not mean that Gap 
</p>
<p>will never be criticized, but it does mean that they are more confident that the com-
</p>
<p>pany will do the right thing by taking responsibility and acting swiftly.
</p>
<p> Gap and&nbsp;Lesotho
</p>
<p>The classic response to the pictures of Lesotho children picking through burning 
</p>
<p>garbage and an indigo-blue river would have been for the company to deny respon-
</p>
<p>sibility, blame the problems on the subcontractor, and then cut all ties with the 
</p>
<p>offending company.
</p>
<p>That was the old script. Instead, Gap responded again as it had in India&nbsp;&ndash; quickly 
</p>
<p>and proactively. On August 2nd 2009, Henkle delivered a media statement regard-
</p>
<p>ing Lesotho in which he declared the company&rsquo;s commitment to improving the lives 
</p>
<p>of workers in Lesotho and announced the steps Gap intended to take to resolve the 
</p>
<p>situation. On September 18th, Gap and Levi Strauss issued a joint statement detail-
</p>
<p>ing the actions they had taken or requested of others. These included internal and 
</p>
<p>independent investigations; meetings with their suppliers and local government offi-
</p>
<p>cials; immediate repair of a broken municipal waste pipe; and enhancement of fac-
</p>
<p>tory management training to ensure compliance with their codes of conduct.
</p>
<p>Neil Kearney, former general secretary of the International Textile Garment &amp; 
</p>
<p>Leather Workers&rsquo; Federation, a global union federation, placed the Lesotho story 
</p>
<p>in a larger context, emphasizing Gap and Levi&rsquo;s role in improving working condi-
</p>
<p>tions in Lesotho. He also criticized those who attacked Gap and Levi&rsquo;s for being 
</p>
<p>irresponsible, &ldquo;using easy targets&hellip; without recognizing the progress that has 
</p>
<p>been made and the contribution of these easy targets.&rdquo; For Gap, the defense by a 
</p>
<p>veteran union leader who had campaigned against the company in the past was a 
</p>
<p>vindication of the engagement strategy. More generally, Gap&rsquo;s stakeholder 
</p>
<p>engagement strategy has changed stakeholder perceptions of the company, and 
</p>
<p>Gap has received awards and public recognition as a leader in corporate ethics and 
</p>
<p>responsibility.
</p>
<p>Public crises are all but inevitable for major brands with extended supply chains 
</p>
<p>in emerging markets. Their outcome is not. &ldquo;It is not a crime to find child labor in 
</p>
<p>your supply chain,&rdquo; said Dan Rees, former ETI director. &ldquo;What is important is what 
</p>
<p>you do about it when you find out.&rdquo; As Gap has learned over the past decade, if the 
</p>
<p>level of engagement is deep enough, such crises can be turned into opportunities 
</p>
<p>that leave the company and its stakeholders stronger.

<p>12Barrick Gold: A&nbsp;Perfect Storm at Pascua Lama
N. Craig&nbsp;Smith and&nbsp;Erin&nbsp;McCormick
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>As Peter Munk fended off calls for his resignation in the fall of 2013, the gold min-
</p>
<p>ing company he had founded in1980 was at the centre of what he called a &ldquo;perfect 
</p>
<p>storm&rdquo; of environmental, community and stockholder pressures.1 Based in Toronto, 
</p>
<p>Canada, Barrick Gold Corporation had built its position as the world&rsquo;s biggest gold 
</p>
<p>mining company on a policy of &ldquo;responsible mining&rdquo;, which involved careful envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental planning and millions of dollars of investment in the communities where 
</p>
<p>it mined. At 85, Munk still guided the corporation as chair of the board (Fig.&nbsp;12.1). 
</p>
<p>But now its success was threatened by tougher requirements from environmental 
</p>
<p>regulators, community protests, and demands for greater profit-sharing from the 
</p>
<p>governments of several nations where its most promising mining developments 
</p>
<p>were underway. Furthermore, the price of gold had dropped precipitously. 
</p>
<p>Shareholders were calling for a reconstitution of the Barrick&rsquo;s board, saying current 
</p>
<p>members, like Munk, were out of sync with the current market realities.
</p>
<p>At the centre of this storm was the huge Pascua Lama mining project that Barrick 
</p>
<p>was developing high in the Andes, straddling the border of Chile and Argentina. Set 
</p>
<p>in a remote region among ancient glaciers, the mine would tap into one of the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s largest gold reserves, believed to hold nearly 18 million ounces of gold and 
</p>
<p>676 million ounces of silver.2 As the world&rsquo;s first mine to operate across national

</p>
<p>borders, Pascua Lama would set a precedent for other ambitious mining projects 
</p>
<p>which Barrick hoped to develop in the same region.
</p>
<p>The company had already poured more than $5 billion into the giant construction 
</p>
<p>project, which it listed as its top priority.3 Start of production had been delayed to 
</p>
<p>2016, and it had already cost billions more than anticipated when it started planning 
</p>
<p>in 1997. It had been a dismal year for the project. First a court had delayed construc-
</p>
<p>tion on the Chilean side of the project, after an indigenous community in the region 
</p>
<p>had alleged that the project would pollute local water supplies. Then environmental 
</p>
<p>regulators halted construction on the Chilean side until Barrick could complete the 
</p>
<p>installation of an improved water management system. These problems and the 
</p>
<p>drop in gold prices sent the company&rsquo;s stock on the Toronto and New&nbsp;York Stock 
</p>
<p>exchanges tumbling: it had lost nearly 50% of its value since the beginning of the 
</p>
<p>year. Some analysts were calling on the company to get out of the business of build-
</p>
<p>ing new mines altogether.4
</p>
<p>Originally, the governments the Chile and Argentina had welcomed the Pascua 
</p>
<p>Lama project as a way to bring jobs and economic benefits to a desolate and impov-
</p>
<p>erished region. Barrick had gone through years of negotiations and made many 
</p>
<p>concessions, including abandoning a plan to move parts of the glacier, to get the 
</p>
<p>necessary environmental permits. The company had recruited support among many 
</p>
<p>members of the communities nearby. But despite almost 1000 community meetings 
</p>
<p>and millions spent on local improvements for those who lived around the mine,5 not 
</p>
<p>everyone had been won over.
</p>
<p>The cost overruns and the obstacles mounted by local residents and international 
</p>
<p>environmental groups who opposed the project had grown so high that, as Munk

<p>and other company officials explained to shareholders, they now had to consider 
</p>
<p>whether to suspend the project altogether.
</p>
<p>Outside the Barrick&rsquo;s annual meeting at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre in 
</p>
<p>April, several dozen protesters waved banners saying Barrick&rsquo;s gold was a &ldquo;toxic 
</p>
<p>asset&rdquo;. (Figure&nbsp;12.2) Inside, the 85-year-old Munk told the crowd of 700 sharehold-
</p>
<p>ers and employees that the very fundamentals which had inspired mining compa-
</p>
<p>nies to expand into developing nations&nbsp;&ndash; high gold prices and governments eager for

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did we know then that we were going to run into, every year, more and more

</p>
<p> Background
</p>
<p> Barrick Gold Corporation
</p>
<p>Barrick had launched its gold mining business in 1983, riding the wave of social 
</p>
<p>consciousness known as the anti-apartheid movement (protesting apartheid in South 
</p>
<p>Africa). Thirty years later, the company was the world&rsquo;s largest gold producer with 
</p>
<p>adjusted net earnings of $3.8 billion in 2012. It generated 7.4 million ounces of gold 
</p>
<p>and 468 million pounds of copper. It had 27 mines or mining projects in Argentina, 
</p>
<p>Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi 
</p>
<p>Arabia, Tanzania, the United States and Zambia.6
</p>
<p>It started as a failing oil and gas exploration company. The Hungarian-born Peter 
</p>
<p>Munk, whose family fled the Nazis to Switzerland, arrived in Canada from war-torn 
</p>
<p>Europe in 1948 at the age of 18. A shell-shocked Jew with little English, a funny- 
</p>
<p>looking suit and hardly a friend in the world, he expected to be shunned when he 
</p>
<p>presented himself at Lawrence Park Collegiate, a high school in Toronto. Instead, 
</p>
<p>the Canadians he met promptly took him in.7
</p>
<p>Before long, he was pursuing big business ambitions. He launched a stereo com-
</p>
<p>pany and a hotel chain. He and a partner founded Barrick Petroleum Corporation in 
</p>
<p>1980. They never struck oil and suffered huge financial losses, so in 1983 they 
</p>
<p>decided to go into mining precious metal to take advantage of investors&rsquo; deserting 
</p>
<p>the gold mines run under South Africa&rsquo;s apartheid government.
</p>
<p>Under a new name, Barrick Resources, the company went public on the Toronto 
</p>
<p>Stock Exchange and generated $2.5 million. The plan was to target European pen-
</p>
<p>sion funds that had investments in the increasingly unstable South African gold 
</p>
<p>market. Munk sought to offer investors more stable markets in gold mines based in 
</p>
<p>North America. They started by acquiring stakes in already-operating mines in 
</p>
<p>Alaska&rsquo;s Valdez Creek region and in Ontario, Canada.
</p>
<p>Barrick quickly earned a reputation for improving production at existing mines 
</p>
<p>and for protecting investors with aggressive hedging that shielded its profits even if 
</p>
<p>the price of gold went down.
</p>
<p>For decades, it pursued growth with a series of acquisitions. It became the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>largest gold mining company in 2006, when it acquired Placer Dome Inc. with an 
</p>
<p>offer worth US$10.4 billion. By 2012, Barrick had 27,000 employees around the 
</p>
<p>globe. (See Fig.&nbsp; 12.3 for a summary of the company&rsquo;s financial performance as 
</p>
<p>reported to stakeholders in the company&rsquo;s 2012 financial summary.)
</p>
<p>One of the company&rsquo;s stated goals was to be the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s best gold mining com-
</p>
<p>pany&rdquo; by operating in a &ldquo;safe, profitable and responsible manner&rdquo;. It had a policy of

</p>
<p>Ranked as one of North America&rsquo;s best companies in terms of corporate respon-

<p>the Corporate Knights Global 100 list of the most sustainable companies. It had set 
</p>
<p>up a Corporate Responsibility Advisory Board and human rights compliance 
</p>
<p>programmes.
</p>
<p>Yet Barrick&nbsp; &ndash; and Munk himself&nbsp; &ndash; had become targets of environmental and 
</p>
<p>social protests, by opponents who called into question the company&rsquo;s motives for 
</p>
<p>social responsibility and the effects of its mines on pristine landscapes and local 
</p>
<p>communities. In its push for expansion, the company had acquired and developed 
</p>
<p>mines in some &ldquo;challenging environments&rdquo;, where corruption, violence and poverty 
</p>
<p>were endemic, and human rights were often flouted. Barrick claimed to make it a 
</p>
<p>priority to improve the lives of citizens in countries like these&nbsp;&ndash; first by stoking the 
</p>
<p>economy and adding employment opportunities, then through community enhance-
</p>
<p>ments such as building hospitals and schools. (See Fig.&nbsp;12.4 for geographic break-
</p>
<p>down of Barrick&rsquo;s international gold production.)
</p>
<p>In 2011, Barrick came under fire when police security guards at the partly-owned 
</p>
<p>Northern Mara gold mine in a remote area of Tanzania shot at marauding locals 
</p>
<p>looking for remnants of gold rocks on the site. The company was also called to 
</p>
<p>account for rapes allegedly committed by its workers at a mine in Papua New 
</p>
<p>Guinea.8 A newly-opened mine in the Dominican Republic, which Barrick operated 
</p>
<p>in a joint venture with Goldcorp, faced a setback when the government demanded a 
</p>
<p>larger share of the profits just a few months after the mine began operating in 2013. 
</p>
<p>To cap it all, the company&rsquo;s push to develop Pascua Lama in the Andes had drawn 
</p>
<p>international protest from environmentalists.
</p>
<p>But Munk often restated his vow that the company would conduct its mining in 
</p>
<p>a socially responsible fashion:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough to have money. It&rsquo;s not enough to have reserves. It&rsquo;s not enough to have 
great mining people,&rdquo; he told shareholders in 2012. &ldquo;Today, the single most critical factor 
in growing a mining company is a social consensus&mdash;a license to mine.&rdquo;

</p>
<p> Pascua Lama
</p>
<p>The Pascua Lama mining project posed unprecedented challenges&nbsp;&ndash; both political 
</p>
<p>and engineering&nbsp;&ndash; as the first gold mine to straddle national borders and at the diz-
</p>
<p>zying altitude of 5000 metres above sea level.
</p>
<p>Sitting on one of the world&rsquo;s biggest gold reserves, the open-pit mine was 
</p>
<p>expected to generate an average of 800,000&ndash;850,000&nbsp; oz of gold and 35 million 
</p>
<p>ounces of silver per year in its first 5&nbsp;years, at very low cost. It had a projected lifes-
</p>
<p>pan of 25&nbsp;years.9 It was being built on mountain ledges so high that most plants 
</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t grow there, and workers had to be checked frequently for altitude sickness. 
</p>
<p>Even in the summer the land was mostly barren. Temperatures ranged from 30&nbsp;&deg;C 
</p>
<p>to minus 40.10
</p>
<p>The nearest community on the Chilean side was 45&nbsp; km westward down the 
</p>
<p>mountain. The nearest Argentine neighbours were 156&nbsp;km away. Both were keenly 
</p>
<p>interested in the project&rsquo;s potential to impact their water supplies. The mountain 
</p>
<p>peaks, where the project was being built, tower above Chile&rsquo;s Atacama desert 
</p>
<p>region, one of the driest areas on earth. The land there gets almost no rain and 
</p>
<p>depends upon the runoff from snowfall in the Andes Mountains for almost all its 
</p>
<p>water. The Huasco Valley on the Chilean side, with a population of 66,000, is dotted 
</p>
<p>with olive groves and vineyards, where a sweet wine called pajarete is produced.
</p>
<p>Historically, the populations in the valleys below had had some of Chile and 
</p>
<p>Argentina&rsquo;s highest high poverty and unemployment rates, but the Pascua Lama 
</p>
<p>project promised to increase opportunities. In February 2013, some 12,500 people 
</p>
<p>were working on the construction of the project.11 According to Barrick, the Pascua 
</p>
<p>Lama promised to generate 1660 direct jobs during the 25&nbsp;years of its operation. It 
</p>
<p>had received more than 145,000 applications for employment, most from people in 
</p>
<p>the surrounding areas.
</p>
<p>Before it could even begin the project, Barrick had to help negotiate a treaty 
</p>
<p>between the governments of Argentina and Chile to allow the gold&nbsp;&ndash; 75% of which 
</p>
<p>was expected to come from the Chilean side&nbsp;&ndash; to cross the border by truck and con-
</p>
<p>veyor belt to the Argentina side for most of the processing.
</p>
<p>Exploration for the project began in 1994, after Barrick acquired the assets of 
</p>
<p>Lac Minerals Corporation. In 2000, Barrick submitted a first environmental impact 
</p>
<p>report (EIR) to the Chilean government, but low gold prices kept the project on 
</p>
<p>hold. A second EIR was submitted in 2004. At that time, the mine was estimated to 
</p>
<p>cost $1.5 billion and go into production in 2009.

</p>
<p>Since then, Barrick had spent more than $15 million and 200,000 man hours 
</p>
<p>generating 5336 pages of environmental review documents to obtain the permits for 
</p>
<p>the Chilean side alone.12 Meanwhile the project had piled up enough delays and cost 
</p>
<p>overruns to make it one of the most expensive mines ever constructed. By the fall of 
</p>
<p>2013, Pascua&rsquo;s expected total costs by end-of-project had soared to $8.5 billion and 
</p>
<p>production had been pushed back to mid-2016.
</p>
<p> Stakeholder Outreach Efforts
</p>
<p>As part of the company&rsquo;s commitment &ldquo;to be a partner in every community where it 
</p>
<p>operates&rdquo; Barrick had conducted information campaigns and poured resources into 
</p>
<p>the region around Pascua Lama. Starting in 2000, the company held &ldquo;disclosure 
</p>
<p>meetings&rdquo;, conducted a door-to-door information campaign that reached 40% of the 
</p>
<p>homes in the Huasco region, mounted television, radio and billboard ad campaigns, 
</p>
<p>and set up community information offices in&nbsp;local towns and villages in communi-
</p>
<p>ties on either side of the border. Barrick held nearly 1000 meetings and dozens of 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;open houses&rsquo; in the region to solicit and respond to community comments.13(See 
</p>
<p>Fig.&nbsp;12.5 for photo of outreach efforts.)
</p>
<p>In February 2006, the Chilean region&rsquo;s environmental commission set more than 
</p>
<p>400 conditions the company needed to meet in order to go forward with the project, 
</p>
<p>many of which reflected the comments and concerns expressed by affected residents 
</p>
<p>during the review process. Barrick agreed to changes, including changing the mine 
</p>
<p>pit&rsquo;s boundary to avoid glaciers, increasing the project&rsquo;s environmental monitoring,

</p>
<p>moving the rock crusher to a below-ground location, road improvements, and the 
</p>
<p>addition of a camp for 750 workers (instead of having them transported to the mine 
</p>
<p>daily). By 2009 it had all the government go-aheads needed for the project.
</p>
<p>While conducting the required environmental review, Barrick was spearheading 
</p>
<p>dozens of social projects for local residents. It built a paediatric ward to improve a 
</p>
<p>poorly-equipped hospital in Rodeo, Argentina. It funded school buses to take 
</p>
<p>Chilean children to school in the Huasco Valley area. It built housing for victims of 
</p>
<p>Chile&rsquo;s devastating 2010 earthquake. It partnered with Intel Corporation to bring 
</p>
<p>laptops and teacher training to secondary schools in Chile, and sponsored a dental 
</p>
<p>hygiene program that served 2000 children. It paid to create a book and education 
</p>
<p>programmes on the history of the valley&rsquo;s local Diaguita indigenous tribe, and it 
</p>
<p>teamed up with the Chilean government to create a fund to bring $60 million in 
</p>
<p>water system improvements to local consumers over the lifetime of the mine.14 In 
</p>
<p>addition, the company ran training programmes to give local residents the skills to 
</p>
<p>work in the mining industry and supplier development programmes to help local 
</p>
<p>merchants gain the expertise to provide supplies to Pascua Lama.
</p>
<p>The mine gained fans in the community. In 2007, Barrick published a letter 
</p>
<p>addressed to the regional government from a residents&rsquo; association representing 
</p>
<p>6600 families in the Huasco province of Chile supporting the mine&rsquo;s development:
</p>
<p>For many years we have seen how our families, friends and neighbours have been forced to 
</p>
<p>leave their homes in search of jobs&hellip; There are many who fight against our people&rsquo;s prog-
</p>
<p>ress, to keep them living in inadequate conditions, with no aspirations. But it is time for us 
</p>
<p>to raise our voices demanding the same opportunities that others have had. Our people 
</p>
<p>deserve prosperity.
</p>
<p>But other community members protested that the land was sure to be harmed by the 
</p>
<p>vast amount of rock crushing and chemicals the gold mine operations would bring. 
</p>
<p>Each ounce of pure gold can require removal of as much as 20-tons of rocks, creat-
</p>
<p>ing rubble heaps the size of a 30-story building.15 They worried about the effect on 
</p>
<p>the glaciers. They said their sleepy farming community would be turned into a 
</p>
<p>booming mining town that might be abandoned when the mine closed 25&nbsp;years later.
</p>
<p>During the EIR process in 2006, protesters dumped chunks of ice in front of the 
</p>
<p>presidential palace in Santiago, Chile, to symbolize the destruction of glaciers. In 
</p>
<p>the years that followed, protesters marched on the streets of Vallenar, the biggest 
</p>
<p>city in Huasco province, and Greenpeace protesters were arrested for blocking 
</p>
<p>trucks heading to the mine site. An email petition purporting to be written by valley 
</p>
<p>farmers circled the globe, charging that the project would destroy the glaciers,

</p>
<p>contaminate rivers, and then &ldquo;every last gramme of gold will go abroad to the mul-
</p>
<p>tinational corporation.&rdquo;16
</p>
<p>While Barrick responded that many of these claims were exaggerated or dis-
</p>
<p>torted, the company&rsquo;s outreach efforts seemed to have backfired. Opponents of the 
</p>
<p>project charged that Barrick had simply been buying off community members by 
</p>
<p>paying for costly social benefits. They complained that the Barrick logo had become 
</p>
<p>so prevalent on school buses, new medical clinics and billboards in the Huasco 
</p>
<p>Valley that the area was becoming a company town. They even charged that Barrick 
</p>
<p>had tried to get supporters elected in&nbsp;local mayoral contests.17
</p>
<p>In particular, opponents pointed to the Pro-Water Fund, created with money from 
</p>
<p>Barrick and the Chilean government, which had committed to spend $60 million on 
</p>
<p>improvements such as sealing irrigation ditches to prevent water waste through 
</p>
<p>evaporation. This resulted in some farmers getting use out of arid lands that couldn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>have farmed before. But it also divided the 2000-member irrigation users group 
</p>
<p>from others who didn&rsquo;t enjoy the benefits. Opponents, labelled the fund &ldquo;hush 
</p>
<p>money&rdquo;, noting that members of the irrigation network had vehemently opposed the 
</p>
<p>Pascua Lama mine until it negotiated the Water Fund with Barrick in 2005.18
</p>
<p>Some groups said they had been completely disenfranchised. A group represent-
</p>
<p>ing some of the indigenous Diaguita people living in the Huasco Valley region of 
</p>
<p>Chile, for example, accused government leaders and company officials of ignoring 
</p>
<p>local community concerns in their haste to get money flowing from the gold mine. 
</p>
<p>In two separate lawsuits, they claimed that the project would jeopardize the water 
</p>
<p>and environmental health of the region and impinge upon their ancestral lands. They 
</p>
<p>also claimed that the company had divided their community by creating education 
</p>
<p>programmes that were not faithful to the indigenous traditions of the region, show-
</p>
<p>ing a picture of local indigenous people dressed up in &ldquo;fake&rdquo; Indian costumes.
</p>
<p>In 2010, members of the indigenous community came to Barrick&rsquo;s annual meet-
</p>
<p>ing in Toronto to express their opposition to the project:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barrick has manipulated and corrupted our culture,&rdquo; said a letter from represen-
</p>
<p>tatives of the Diaguita Huascoaltinos Indigenous and Agricultural community pre-
</p>
<p>sented to Barrick shareholders. (See Fig.&nbsp;12.6 for a full copy of the letter.)
</p>
<p>McGill University History Professor Daviken Studnicki-Gizbert, who is also the 
</p>
<p>coordinator of the McGill research group investigating Canadian mining in Latin 
</p>
<p>America, said Barrick&rsquo;s approach to corporate social responsibility was more akin 
</p>
<p>to public relations than genuine community involvement: &ldquo;It gives an aura of con-
</p>
<p>cern and respectability to the industry on social and environmental issues. But the 
</p>
<p>company never sits down and actually says, &ldquo;Do you want this mine here?&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Studnicki-Gizbert, told the Montreal Gazette. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not consultation. It&rsquo;s a 
</p>
<p>performance.&rdquo;

<p>We have come from the Huasco Valley in Chile, representing the Diaguita Huascoaltinos Indigenous and 
</p>
<p>Agricultural Community. We are the direct heirs of the Native People of Huasco Alto, and we have 
</p>
<p>inhabited this land since time immemorial. Our Community consists of  250 families of indigenous peasants,

<p>farmers and herders; we are the only Diaguita community that remained organized after the Spanish colony

<p>in Huasco Valley and we also have title to our lands.
</p>
<p>Huasco Valley is the last unpolluted valley of northern Chile. Our lands guard important natural and cultural 
</p>
<p>resources, and they hold the major fresh water reservoirs of this valley. That is why in 2006 we decided to 
</p>
<p>make our Community territory a Natural and Cultural Reserve. This is incompatible with Barrick&rsquo;s Pascua 
</p>
<p>Lama and future Pachuy megaproject.
</p>
<p>Barrick Gold, without respect for our traditions, our plans and our right to self-determination, wants to force 
</p>
<p>us to accept the mega mining in our Reserve. In 1998, Barrick Gold seized about 124,000 acres of ancestral 
</p>
<p>lands that belong to our Community. Then, Barrick installed a locked gate that prevents the passage of 
</p>
<p>herders through our own land. This gate is illegal as this road is public, but Barrick continues to refuse 
</p>
<p>public access.
</p>
<p>The Pascua Lama project was approved by the State of Chile in 2001 without permission from our 
</p>
<p>community. So we sued the State of Chile in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rigths, and this 
</p>
<p>demand was admitted for processing in February of this year.
</p>
<p>Although the project officially began this year, Barrick exploration has led to the degradation of the 
</p>
<p>glaciers near the Pascua Lama project. In 2005, the General Directorate of Water of Chile issued a 
</p>
<p>report that blames the company for the loss of 50-75% of glaciers in the area. Recently, on November 
</p>
<p>11, 2009, the Chilean Government fined Barrick Gold for, among other things, continuing to damage 
</p>
<p>the glaciers, drawing water from unauthorized sites and breaking occupational health and air quality 
</p>
<p>commitments.
</p>
<p>Now, Barrick has illegally extended its work to other sectors of our domain title. In those areas, we 
</p>
<p>can already see the destruction of wetlands and forests, and the extraction of water from 
</p>
<p>unauthorized sites, among other damages. These actions have led us to bring two lawsuits against the 
</p>
<p>company in the courts of Chile which are now being processed.
</p>
<p>Also, in seeking to better its image, Barrick Gold, in conjunction with the National Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Development Corporation of Chile, has promoted the creation of Diaguita Communities with no 
</p>
<p>territorial base. With financial support from the company, Barrick has manipulated and corrupted 
</p>
<p>our culture. They have denied that we, Huascoaltinos, are an indigenous people, they have raised 
</p>
<p>false community leaders, and they have brought professionals to teach the Huascoaltinos about our 
</p>
<p>own culture. What right do you have to come to teach us about our own traditions? What right do 
</p>
<p>you have to manipulate our traditions, inventing costumes, dances, forms of weaving and pottery that
</p>
<p>are not our own? With this, the company has divided and confused the identity of our people, and 
</p>
<p>has caused us great damage.
</p>
<p>We have always been aware that in the land of Huascoaltinos there is great mineral wealth, but our 
</p>
<p>real wealth is its landscapes, the pure water rising in the Andes, with its unique animals and plants. 
</p>
<p>It is our responsibility to protect this precious legacy, as a mark of respect to our ancestors, as a gift 
</p>
<p>to our children and grandchildren, and also as a contribution to the care of Mother Earth and the 
</p>
<p>heritage of all mankind. Therefore, as Huascoaltinos, we are going to defend the Valley. We will not 
</p>
<p>allow Barrick to destroy our land and our culture. We will not allow you to appropriate the legacy 
</p>
<p>left by our ancestors. Today, we come here to order the closure of Pascua Lama. Shareholders, if you 
</p>
<p>continue to mine in our lands, you will remain complicit in the pollution and destruction of our 
</p>
<p>culture and you will be enriched in return for the death of our people. We are here to tell you again 
</p>
<p>that we do not need your money to develop and we are not seeking compensation, because there is 
</p>
<p>not fair compensation for the death of our Mother. We just want you to leave our lands and allow us 
</p>
<p>to live in peace.

</p>
<p>Yet, in speaking about the Barrick&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility efforts, Peter 
</p>
<p>Munk has said that the company needs to draw a line between genuine stakeholders 
</p>
<p>and those who oppose all industry:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we love NGOs&hellip;We equally have to stand up to those who are, just on principle, 
</p>
<p>against any type of development,&rdquo; Munk told shareholders in 2012. &ldquo;Instead of working 
with us to develop better mine operations&hellip;they say: whatever you do, go away. We don&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>want you. What are people going to do, line up for social programmes in the remote hills of 
</p>
<p>Tanzania or Peru? There ain&rsquo;t no social programmes there, so there is no alternative.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Environmental Concerns
</p>
<p>For residents of the valleys down the slopes from Pascua Lama, the biggest worry 
</p>
<p>was that the project would dissipate or contaminate their already-dwindling water 
</p>
<p>supplies. (See Fig.&nbsp;12.7 for map of the project.) Once in operation, the mine would 
</p>
<p>use up to 38&nbsp;tons of explosives a day to blast mountain tops into rocks, then up to 
</p>

</p>
<p>27&nbsp;tons of cyanide and 33 million litres of water per day to extract the gold.19 The 
</p>
<p>mine&rsquo;s processing plant would have the capacity to move 45,000&nbsp;tons of ore per day 
</p>
<p>through a cyanide leaching process. Barrick said that the mine would only draw 
</p>
<p>about 0.3% of the water flowing down the Huasco River into the Chilean valley&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>main reservoir. The rest would come from the Argentina side, where most of the 
</p>
<p>processing facilities were being constructed.
</p>
<p>Seeing as how the Huasco farming region on the Chilean side of the border 
</p>
<p>depended upon runoff which coursed down the slopes from the Pascua Lama area, 
</p>
<p>Barrick planned to prevent contamination that could occur if natural runoff were to 
</p>
<p>pass through the mine site. The company acknowledged that if precipitation, snow 
</p>
<p>melt or runoff passed through the mine, it could produce acidic water potentially 
</p>
<p>harmful to the environment. This toxic runoff, known as acid rock drainage (ARD), 
</p>
<p>is released when sulphides in the rock come into contact with air and water. The 
</p>
<p>disturbance caused by crushing tons of rock in the mining process could worsen the 
</p>
<p>acidification.
</p>
<p>Barrick planned to prevent acid drainage from coming into contact with the sur-
</p>
<p>rounding landscape by capturing and diverting water that would have naturally 
</p>
<p>flowed through the mine facility. Instead it would be carried around the site in 
</p>
<p>troughs that encircled the mine&rsquo;s perimeter. It would run the water used in the min-
</p>
<p>ing process through a treatment plant, then recycle it to be used again in mining. The 
</p>
<p>company promised to monitor the quality of any water leaving the Barrick property 
</p>
<p>going into the Huasco Valley and ensure it met Chilean potable water standards 
</p>
<p>15&nbsp;km upstream from the nearest users. Water quality would be monitored at 49 
</p>
<p>surface and underground points in Chile and 25 points in Argentina.20
</p>
<p>In practice, regulators started finding fault with the mine&rsquo;s environmental regula-
</p>
<p>tion systems long before Pascua Lama was due to open. In January 2013, Barrick 
</p>
<p>said, one of the water diversion channels on the Chilean side collapsed, causing a 
</p>
<p>mudslide that flooded a small area of vegetation. The facility was forced to let natu-
</p>
<p>ral runoff water flow through the mine construction site&nbsp;&ndash; a violation of Barrick&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>environmental permit.21
</p>
<p>The violation resulted in Chilean regulators suspending construction on the 
</p>
<p>Chilean side of the project until Barrick could complete millions of dollars in 
</p>
<p>improvements to the water diversion system. The regulator claimed that under its 
</p>
<p>permit, Barrick should have finished the water system before it started the &ldquo;pre- 
</p>
<p>stripping process&rdquo; of moving tons of rock mountain tops to reach the gold- containing 
</p>
<p>ore underneath, but didn&rsquo;t.22 (See Fig.&nbsp; 12.8 for Barrick&rsquo;s explanation of the 
</p>
<p>problem.)

<p>The Chilean government had already suspended pre-stripping in October 2012, 
</p>
<p>citing concerns that excessive dust from the pre-stripping process could harm work-
</p>
<p>ers&rsquo; health. Also hanging over the project was a law approved by Argentina&rsquo;s con-
</p>
<p>gress in 2010 banning any mining on or around glaciers. The measure passed into 
</p>
<p>law, but hadn&rsquo;t been enforced by local authority&rsquo;s overseeing Pascua Lama&rsquo;s devel-
</p>
<p>opment in Argentina&rsquo;s San Juan Province. Environmentalists were pressing for the 
</p>
<p>law to be used to stop the mine, but Barrick denied it was applicable as the ore it was

</p>
<p>mining was not under a glacier. Courts had also demanded a stop to the construction 
</p>
<p>on the Chilean side of the project while they considered the validity of the environ-
</p>
<p>mental claims by members of the indigenous Diaguita community.
</p>
<p>While the locals were most concerned about whether Pascua Lama would harm 
</p>
<p>their water supplies, it was the potential to damage glaciers that worried the interna-
</p>
<p>tional environmental community most. The Glacier Estrecho was a few kilometres 
</p>
<p>to the north of the vast pit Barrick was clearing for the mine. To the south was 
</p>
<p>Glacier Guanaco. Within the boundaries of the mine site were three smaller glaciers, 
</p>
<p>referred to by Barrick as &ldquo;glacierets&rdquo; or &ldquo;ice reserves,&rdquo; known as Toro 1, Toro 2 and 
</p>
<p>Esperanza.
</p>
<p>In its 2005 environmental report, Barrick had proposed getting at some of the 
</p>
<p>buried gold deposits by moving some of this ice by bulldozer and attaching it to 
</p>
<p>another glacier a few kilometres away. But Chile had insisted as one of 400 environ-
</p>
<p>mental conditions set on the project in the permit process that &ldquo;the company shall 
</p>
<p>only access the ore in a manner that does not remove, relocate, destroy or physically 
</p>
<p>intervene with the Toro 1, Toro 2, and Esperanza glaciers.&rdquo; The company then 
</p>
<p>redrew the boundaries of the mine pit to avoid the glacial areas, thus agreeing to 
</p>
<p>leave more than one million ounces of gold under the ice. Barrick vowed not to 
</p>
<p>impact the small glaciers, which it said were already melting due to global warming. 
</p>
<p>It planned monitoring programmes to watch for impacts with photographic surveys, 
</p>
<p>meltwater monitoring and baseline statistical comparisons.
</p>
<p>But environmental groups claimed damage had already been done in Barrick&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>initial exploration of the site and in the pre-stripping process. A technical report by 
</p>
<p>the Center for Human Rights and Environment, an NGO in Cordoba, Argentina, 
</p>
<p>claimed glaciers had already been affected by road-building and the dust and dis-
</p>
<p>ruption caused by explosions used in the process of building Pascua Lama and 
</p>
<p>Veladero, another Barrick mine 10&nbsp;km away on the Argentina side of the border, 
</p>
<p>which went into operation in 2005. The report claimed that the small glacier Toro 1 
</p>
<p>had been completely covered in debris and dust from construction, which had the 
</p>
<p>potential to change the glacier&rsquo;s reflectivity and accelerate melting. It said Google 
</p>
<p>satellite images showed that roads were built right through the glaciers during the 
</p>
<p>exploratory process.23
</p>
<p>Barrick acknowledged that the glaciers had shrunk, but attributed it to the effects 
</p>
<p>of global warming. Barrick Corporation President Jamie Sokalsky told shareholders 
</p>
<p>in April: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s important to note there have been no adverse impacts on water quality 
</p>
<p>or glaciers.&rdquo;

</p>
<p> Industry-Wide Woes
</p>
<p>As Munk explained to shareholders at Barrick&rsquo;s 2013 annual meeting, even larger mar-
</p>
<p>ket forces were threatening to capsize the entire gold mining industry. For years, gold 
</p>
<p>prices had been pumped up by the world&rsquo;s economic worries. Between 2007 and 2011 
</p>
<p>the price of gold tripled from around $680 to an all-time high of $1920 an ounce, send-
</p>
<p>ing mining companies scrambling to develop new sources of precious ore. Most of the 
</p>
<p>easily-accessible gold had already been mined, forcing miners to undertake ambitious 
</p>
<p>projects to cull the valuable metal from increasingly lower grades of ore. Like Barrick, 
</p>
<p>many companies had launched expensive mega-mining projects.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, said Munk, the world&rsquo;s citizens were becoming more environmentally- 
</p>
<p>conscious and regulators were becoming tougher on mining projects. Developing 
</p>
<p>countries were showing increasing signs of &lsquo;resource nationalism&rsquo; and demanding 
</p>
<p>greater royalties from projects. All this pushed costs up at the worst time.
</p>
<p>The price of gold began falling in late 2011. By June of 2013 it had taken its big-
</p>
<p>gest plunge since 1980 to $1233 an ounce and in October it still hovered at around 
</p>
<p>only $1300 an ounce, a level that threatened to make much of the ongoing produc-
</p>
<p>tion unprofitable.24 &ldquo;Everybody was enjoying the high tide, and now that the tide is 
</p>
<p>coming down you&rsquo;re seeing who&rsquo;s swimming naked. And the thing is, everybody&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>swimming naked.&rdquo; Veritas Investment Research analyst Pawel Rajszel told Reuters.
</p>
<p>For Barrick, pressure to take new action on Pascua Lama was coming from all 
</p>
<p>sides. Shareholders were demanding immediate profitability and were even calling 
</p>
<p>for Munk&rsquo;s resignation as part of a push for new management direction. 
</p>
<p>Environmentalists and some locals wanted the project to be scrapped altogether. 
</p>
<p>And regulators were looking for quick action on the environmental problems at the 
</p>
<p>site. Meanwhile, the costs the project were rising by the minute, as falling gold 
</p>
<p>prices made the prospect of profitability ever more distant. As the end of 2013 
</p>
<p>neared, the question of what Barrick would do with its most ambitious project 
</p>
<p>loomed large. Should the company push past the opposition to forge ahead with a 
</p>
<p>project that promised to provide rich gold sources for years to come? Or should it 
</p>
<p>turn back on the nearly $5 billion it had already invested?
</p>
<p>Munk made it clear to investors that, under existing conditions, there was no easy 
</p>
<p>course for gold mining interests:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold itself is under attack,&rdquo; he told shareholders in April. &ldquo;There are traders and analysts 
</p>
<p>who have pointed out that trees don&rsquo;t grow to the sky and there&rsquo;s a limit to this bonanza 
</p>
<p>that, for the last 10 or 12&nbsp;years, covered up all kinds of mistakes and flaws and all these 
</p>
<p>missteps, purely by having a higher gold price.&rdquo;

N. Craig&nbsp;Smith and&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Crawford
</p>
<p>In late 2004, Assheton Carter was contemplating what projects he should take on. 
</p>
<p>Carter was an activist at Conservation International (CI) in mining safety, working 
</p>
<p>conditions, the environment, and the rights of community and indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>From his CI unit, the Center for Environmental Leadership in Business (CELB), he 
</p>
<p>was seeking to find a high-profile, high impact project that would both accomplish 
</p>
<p>something concrete and set a precedent&nbsp;&ndash; of transparency in extractive industries, of 
</p>
<p>activist methods, and of cooperative interaction between non-governmental organi-
</p>
<p>zations (NGOs) and multi-national corporations (MNCs). His desk was littered with 
</p>
<p>documents from current projects, including the overall strategy for CI as well as 
</p>
<p>engagements with Disney and the oil and natural gas industries.
</p>
<p>One of his potential projects included Walmart&rsquo;s jewellery business. Walmart, he 
</p>
<p>knew, was the world&rsquo;s largest jewellery retailer, with annual sales of $US2.75 bil-
</p>
<p>lion, which represented nearly 2% of total world sales. Change Walmart&rsquo;s approach 
</p>
<p>to sustainability, he reasoned, and MNCs throughout the world would take notice. 
</p>
<p>However, after nearly 2&nbsp;years of attempting to engage with the company, he had 
</p>
<p>recognized that Walmart personnel changed so fast that he seemed to have to re- 
</p>
<p>educate a new set of managers in the same issues every few months. Not only did 
</p>
<p>that add up to a major commitment of his time, but he felt increasingly frustrated 
</p>
<p>with the lack of momentum.
</p>
<p>Then his phone rang. Dee Breazeale, Vice President for jewellery at the Walmart 
</p>
<p>affiliate Sam&rsquo;s Club, was on the line. &ldquo;Can you fill me in&rdquo;, she asked, &ldquo;on sources of 
</p>
<p>rubies and the challenges with buying rubies from Burma?&rdquo; He had met Breazeale 
</p>
<p>earlier that year at Walmart headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, in a CI delega-
</p>
<p>tion that was negotiating the modalities of an advisory arrangement with the com-
</p>
<p>pany. Her honesty and willingness to learn had deeply impressed him, though little </p>

</p>
<p>had happened in the months that followed. Nonetheless, he knew that, once con-
</p>
<p>vinced, she had the power to act&nbsp;&ndash; immediately.
</p>
<p>Within a week, she decided to purchase all of her unit&rsquo;s rubies from suppliers in 
</p>
<p>Brazil rather than Burma; this represented a major shift in the jewellery market, 
</p>
<p>with global implications. It was at that moment that Carter decided to work more 
</p>
<p>intensively with the company. &ldquo;Dee was not what I was used to when dealing with 
</p>
<p>corporate execs,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;No pretence, no &lsquo;silver tongue&rsquo;, just &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got an 
</p>
<p>issue, I don&rsquo;t like being associated with dirty business, and I want your help to put 
</p>
<p>it right.&rsquo; To me, that was wonderful. I could work with that.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Carter had many ideas on how he might proceed. Executives like Breazeale in 
</p>
<p>Walmart, he observed, were beginning to take a straightforward approach to issues 
</p>
<p>of corporate responsibility and sustainability: &ldquo;Figure out what the problem is; find 
</p>
<p>people who want to help solve it.&rdquo; Those who preferred to denounce Walmart from 
</p>
<p>the sidelines, it was clear, would not be invited. This was, he believed, an opportu-
</p>
<p>nity to impact not just the jewellery market, but to establish a new approach to sus-
</p>
<p>tainability for global businesses. While the &ldquo;conflict diamonds&rdquo; campaign earlier in 
</p>
<p>the decade had been relatively successful, he wanted to do something different by 
</p>
<p>creating a project that would largely rely on MNCs to change and monitor their 
</p>
<p>behaviour&nbsp;&ndash; in a way that made business sense to them&nbsp;&ndash; rather than depend on 
</p>
<p>enforcement by governments and international organizations in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international treaties.
</p>
<p>One of the most promising ideas might be the creation of a &ldquo;green&rdquo; line of jewel-
</p>
<p>lery&nbsp;&ndash; free of &ldquo;dirty gold&rdquo; and &ldquo;conflict diamonds&rdquo;, with sustainable operations and 
</p>
<p>careful attention paid to working conditions along the entire supply chain. Once 
</p>
<p>they established the proper standards for mining companies, and indeed the entire 
</p>
<p>supply chain, the system would have to be transparent and verifiable. No one had 
</p>
<p>ever done this for the mining industry. So it was with these ideas in mind that a few 
</p>
<p>days later Carter picked up the phone to call some NGO colleagues.
</p>
<p> Background
</p>
<p>Sam Walton founded Walmart in 1962, to bring big-city discounting to his corner of 
</p>
<p>the rural American South. His idea was to offer the same range of merchandise 
</p>
<p>found in nearby stores, but at about 20% lower prices every day rather than by short- 
</p>
<p>term sales promotions. While this would lower his profit margins, he calculated that 
</p>
<p>Walmart could triple gross sales. Furthermore, as the company grew Walton instilled 
</p>
<p>a relentless drive in managers to lower costs by going directly to manufacturers, as 
</p>
<p>well as by constantly increasing worker productivity.1 As computer technologies 
</p>
<p>became available, Walmart also developed a distribution network of state-of-the-art

</p>
<p>precision, enabling the company to predict consumer tastes but also to deliver goods 
</p>
<p>where and when they were desired.2
</p>
<p>Walton&rsquo;s formula was a phenomenal success. By 2004, Walmart had become the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s largest corporation and non-governmental employer. Net sales in fiscal 
</p>
<p>2009 exceeded $US400 billion, serving 200 million customers each week in over 
</p>
<p>8400 stores worldwide; operating income reached $24 billion.3 Walmart accounted 
</p>
<p>for approximately 10% of all retail sales in the U.S.4

<p>Combined with its sheer size, Walmart&rsquo;s technological capabilities enabled the 
</p>
<p>company to exert an unprecedented degree of control over not only its employees, 
</p>
<p>but also its business partners (independent manufacturers, suppliers, and 
</p>
<p>distributors).5 A centralized management style placed high expectations on local 
</p>
<p>managers, who routinely worked 60-h weeks. While managers faced brutally 
</p>
<p>demanding targets for cost containment and profitability, they were given an extraor-
</p>
<p>dinarily free hand with which to achieve them, the so-called &ldquo;tight/loose&rdquo; manage-
</p>
<p>ment practice. As long as they acted within their mandate and with support from 
</p>
<p>their superiors, this freedom empowered Walmart managers to pursue their own 
</p>
<p>ideas with energy and creativity so long as they respected certain limits. Walmart&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>centralization represented a fundamental shift of market power to the retailer and 
</p>
<p>away from manufacturers, in effect creating a near-monopsony&nbsp;&ndash; it could impose its 
</p>
<p>will on partners to set prices, to package goods to fit Walmart requirements, and 
</p>
<p>even to adopt management and accounting practices in accordance with Walmart 
</p>
<p>requirements.6
</p>
<p> The Critics
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s power and behaviour galvanized an army of critics and activists, who 
</p>
<p>condemned its practices and began to mount grassroots protest campaigns, boycotts 
</p>
<p>and media attacks in an effort to tarnish the brand.7 First, critics argued, Walmart 
</p>
<p>had to somehow ameliorate its impact on the communities that it entered. Not only 
</p>
<p>did they believe that Walmart destroyed local &ldquo;mom and pop&rdquo; stores that could not 
</p>
<p>compete on price, but it also generated the second-hand effects of increased traffic, 
</p>
<p>reduced demand for other local businesses, such as competing shops and

</p>
<p>newspapers that lost ad revenues, and imposed additional infrastructure costs that 
</p>
<p>generated new tax burdens.8
</p>
<p>Second, Walmart&rsquo;s labour practices, they demanded, had to improve. Employees 
</p>
<p>must be allowed to unionize, earn better wages, obtain affordable health insurance 
</p>
<p>benefits, and enjoy more humane treatment.9 As it stood, many critics charged, the 
</p>
<p>tight/loose management style forced managers to resort to degrading and even ille-
</p>
<p>gal practices in the relentless pursuit of &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; in employee performance, 
</p>
<p>allegedly in the form of unpaid over-time, the effective elimination of rest or meal 
</p>
<p>breaks, and the exploitation of overseas sweatshop labour.10
</p>
<p>Third, they charged, Walmart had to provide a more equitable and environmen-
</p>
<p>tally friendly management of its supply chain, from the treatment of &ldquo;sweatshop 
</p>
<p>workers&rdquo; in China by supply partners to its means of transportation. To meet these 
</p>
<p>goals, many observers believed, Walmart would have to change its business model: 
</p>
<p>the company would have to pay more for the goods and services it bought, which 
</p>
<p>would diminish its razor-thin profit margins and necessitate higher prices. This 
</p>
<p>would violate the principle behind Walmart&rsquo;s &ldquo;everyday low prices&rdquo; formula.11
</p>
<p> Walmart Responds
</p>
<p>For its first few decades of explosive growth, Walmart had ignored the critics as a 
</p>
<p>matter of company policy. The company had virtually no lobbying presence in 
</p>
<p>Washington, DC, and devoted little attention to its image.12 That changed in 2004. 
</p>
<p>Faced with mounting criticism and a momentarily declining stock price, then-Chief 
</p>
<p>Executive Lee Scott decided that Walmart should become a more responsible com-
</p>
<p>pany, to jump ahead of the curve in a move assailed by some as a blatant public 
</p>
<p>relations counter-offensive.13
</p>
<p>The first big success of Scott&rsquo;s new strategy was the company&rsquo;s relief efforts in 
</p>
<p>2005 on behalf of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, in Louisiana and Mississippi.

About It, Ten Speed Press, 2005, pp.&nbsp;1&ndash;26.
9 According to Fishman, op.&nbsp;cit., pp.&nbsp;240&ndash;1, in Tennessee 10,261 children of Walmart employees 
were enrolled in state health care for the poor; in Georgia, 9,617 Walmart associates were provided 
healthcare by state-aided programmes for the poor. Wake-Up Walmart claimed that one in seven 
U.S.&nbsp;Walmart employees had no healthcare coverage and that a substantial number earned below 
the poverty line. See: http://www.wakeupwalmart.com/facts/#healthcare

November, 2005. From 2000 to 2005, Walmart&rsquo;s share price dropped approximately 20&nbsp;%; at that 
time, Walmart appeared to have reached the saturation point of its rural expansion strategy, neces-
sitating a move into urban markets, where it faced a more effective political opposition.

</p>
<p>Scott, who claimed that the Katrina episode led to a personal &ldquo;epiphany&rdquo;, promised 
</p>
<p>that this was only the beginning of the company&rsquo;s transformation.14 Articulating a 
</p>
<p>vision in cooperation with Conservation International and other external groups, 
</p>
<p>Scott promised that the company would become a leader in sustainability, reducing 
</p>
<p>greenhouse gases produced by Walmart stores by 20% over the next seven years, 
</p>
<p>enhancing the efficiency of its truck fleet, which was the largest in the U.S., and 
</p>
<p>innumerable similar measures. Moreover, Scott emphasized, Walmart was taking 
</p>
<p>steps to improve the treatment of its workers: health care coverage would be pro-
</p>
<p>vided to Walmart associates for as low as $25 per month. To further publicize these 
</p>
<p>efforts, Scott even called on the US Congress to raise the minimum wage.15
</p>
<p>Walmart began to take concrete steps to implement Scott&rsquo;s vision, which he dis-
</p>
<p>seminated within the company in a series of &ldquo;aspirational goals&rdquo; that were realistic 
</p>
<p>and transmitted a message of change&nbsp;&ndash; both internally and externally. With the help 
</p>
<p>of consultants, Scott encouraged Walmart employees to undertake &ldquo;Personal 
</p>
<p>Sustainability Projects&rdquo;, which were designed to educate them through voluntary 
</p>
<p>activities, hopefully inspiring them to pursue their own sustainability initiatives. 
</p>
<p>Later, employees elected &ldquo;sustainability captains&rdquo; to communicate their goals and 
</p>
<p>explain their activities to others in the company, eventually growing to include just 
</p>
<p>under one third of all Walmart employees. In addition, Walmart began a number of 
</p>
<p>initiatives to increase the transparency of the company&rsquo;s practices, including:
</p>
<p>&bull; A company-wide effort to identify and openly acknowledge &ldquo;environmental 
</p>
<p>blind spots&rdquo;;
</p>
<p>&bull; A series of reports on its progress toward the aspirational goals;
</p>
<p>&bull; The opening of the company to constructive outside stakeholders.
</p>
<p>Such transparency would, Scott stated, encourage employees to think in new 
</p>
<p>ways, spark an influx of new ideas for improvement, and finally, uncover business 
</p>
<p>opportunities that Walmart had not considered. It was not, in his view, merely gre-
</p>
<p>enwashing, as critics continued to charge.16
</p>
<p>By early 2006, with the aid of CI under a consultancy arrangement, a group of 
</p>
<p>Walmart executives were designating &ldquo;actionable priorities&rdquo; they could pursue. 
</p>
<p>Combining Walmart&rsquo;s sales data with environmental impact factors as articulated 
</p>
<p>by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science-based nonprofit advocacy group, 
</p>
<p>they focused in on 14 areas, which were called &ldquo;Sustainable Value Networks&rdquo;. (See 
</p>
<p>Exhibit 13.1.) In each of the 14 areas, Walmart assigned an Executive Vice President 
</p>
<p>as sponsor along with a &ldquo;network captain&rdquo;, who was usually a Senior Vice President. 
</p>
<p>Dee Breazeale was designated a network captain for jewellery. Like the others, she 
</p>
<p>was mandated to contact academics, NGOs, suppliers and other stakeholders to join 
</p>

</p>
<p>discussions on sustainability measures that Walmart might undertake.17 At this early 
</p>
<p>stage, their actions were voluntary, according to Carter: &ldquo;Dee was acting on her own 
</p>
<p>sense of responsibility, there was no obligation&rdquo; for her or any other participants.
</p>
<p>A native of Arkansas, Dee Breazeale went to a local university. At one time, she had 
</p>
<p>worked as a backup singer to a Country Western band. She had been at Walmart for 
</p>
<p>nearly two decades. After graduating with an MBA, she took an entry level job as a 
</p>
<p>merchandise assistant at Walmart on an hourly wage. Quickly recognizing her commit-
</p>
<p>ment to the company and high potential, her bosses recommended Breazeale for the 
</p>
<p>management fast-track programme. She rotated through every area in the company, 
</p>
<p>from real-estate, human resources and marketing to information systems and operations. 
</p>
<p>Later, Breazeale ran a district of stores in northern California, served three years in 
</p>
<p>Germany with the international division, and returned to Arkansas as Vice President in 
</p>
<p>the jewellery division. At Walmart, she recalled, &ldquo;I was allowed great autonomy to pur-
</p>
<p>sue my vision&hellip; You set a goal, get the signoff, and then you have the freedom to do it 
</p>
<p>just about any way you want&hellip; If it didn&rsquo;t work, they [upper-level managers] let you try 
</p>
<p>something different but just don&rsquo;t make the same mistake twice!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>During the internal discussions on sustainability in 2005, which led to the creation 
</p>
<p>of Walmart&rsquo;s Sustainable Value Networks, Breazeale had become interested in contrib-
</p>
<p>uting to the effort and participating in the jewellery SVN. &ldquo;I loved to take on more,&rdquo; she 
</p>
<p>explained. With the support of her boss, she also committed herself to interface with 
</p>
<p>and represent the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) community in 
</p>
<p>Walmart, which began to attract some critical attention in the local &ldquo;family&rdquo; press. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The typical role of the retailer was to buy product from the suppliers at the best price,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>she recalled. &ldquo;I found the concept of digging into every aspect of getting jewellery to 
</p>
<p>market&nbsp;&ndash; transparently&nbsp;&ndash; a daunting task, but a very positive goal.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The success of a Sustainable Value Network depended in large measure on the 
</p>
<p>energy that their captains devoted to them. Nonetheless, the Walmart employees 
</p>
<p>involved in them still had to accomplish their full-time jobs. Some critics worried that 
</p>
<p>network captains and participating employees lacked the time either to devote them-
</p>
<p>selves to these tasks or indeed to engage their minds in areas they had never had time 
</p>
<p>to contemplate. With few exceptions, there were no new full-time staff hired to run the 
</p>
<p>networks. Some of them, such as the packaging network, had 500 members or more; 
</p>
<p>others, such as Breazeale&rsquo;s jewellery SVN, consisted of only 15 or so. Often, even 
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s determined outside critics were invited to participate.18
</p>
<p> Earthworks and&nbsp;the&nbsp;NGOs
</p>
<p>When Stephen D&rsquo;Esposito joined the NGO Earthworks in 1997, the &ldquo;extractive sec-
</p>
<p>tor&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; the mining of gold, diamonds, and other minerals&nbsp;&ndash; was viewed by activists 
</p>
<p>as fragmented and unfocused, in spite of documented environmental degradation, 
</p>

Review, 1 July, 2007.

</p>
<p>ongoing health issues in mining communities, and innumerable instances where 
</p>
<p>corporations had failed to correct or even examine their conduct. &ldquo;The premise,&rdquo; he 
</p>
<p>recalled, &ldquo;was that, due to the remoteness of mining sites, our leverage was severely 
</p>
<p>limited.&rdquo; As VP for Policy and later President and CEO, D&rsquo;Esposito believed that a 
</p>
<p>new approach, based on the entire life cycle of the products involved, would create 
</p>
<p>opportunities to promote Earthworks&rsquo; agenda in clean water, community health, and 
</p>
<p>corporate social accountability. &ldquo;I wanted to work on the mining companies,&rdquo; he 
</p>
<p>explained, &ldquo;but also involve the refineries, the jewellers, and even the retailers at the 
</p>
<p>end of the life-cycle chain.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As a visible industry that was deeply concerned with branding, he believed that 
</p>
<p>the jewellery sector offered the best opportunity to create influence throughout the 
</p>
<p>overall sector. Indeed, gold mining was one of the dirtiest industries in existence. 
</p>
<p>Not only was it getting more difficult to extract as deposits dwindled&nbsp;&ndash; to produce 
</p>
<p>the gold for a single finger ring generated approximately 20&nbsp;tons of waste, much of 
</p>
<p>it toxic, including cyanide&nbsp;&ndash; and its slag was responsible for the pollution of water-
</p>
<p>ways, vast areas were deforested, and it often displaced communities nearby.19
</p>
<p>Over the previous decade, D&rsquo;Esposito had helped to transform Greenpeace from 
</p>
<p>a collection of local activist groups carrying out their own initiatives into an inte-
</p>
<p>grated, global advocacy and campaign organization. Through its provocative 
</p>
<p>actions, Greenpeace could draw attention to the conduct of corporations or govern-
</p>
<p>ments that it deemed harmful to the environment. It was the quintessential &ldquo;protest 
</p>
<p>NGO&rdquo; that ran campaigns of opposition. Nonetheless, D&rsquo;Esposito felt that a posi-
</p>
<p>tive message&nbsp;&ndash; some species to protect, some specific environment to preserve&nbsp;&ndash; was 
</p>
<p>key to his fundraising efforts. &ldquo;We preferred to build campaigns around saving an 
</p>
<p>animal or a beautiful place, not just attack companies,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It is an over- 
</p>
<p>simplification to say that NGOs must appear in opposition to MNCs to raise money,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>he argued. &ldquo;That is repeated way too often.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>For Earthworks, D&rsquo;Esposito resolved to combine protest actions with a more 
</p>
<p>constructive engagement. The times, he observed, were changing: not only were 
</p>
<p>efforts from within the extractive sector underway to create formal deliberative 
</p>
<p>structures regarding sustainability, but in January, 2000 a major mining accident in 
</p>
<p>Baia Mare, Romania, had captured world media attention and led to demands for 
</p>
<p>action.20 There was also the example of &ldquo;conflict diamonds&rdquo;. In the late 1990s a 
</p>
<p>grassroots campaign sought to restrict the exportation of diamonds as a means to 
</p>
<p>finance civil wars in several countries, such as Sierra Leone and the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Congo. In a few years, the conflict diamonds campaign led directly to 
</p>
<p>the establishment of the Kimberly Process Certification Scheme, whereby the gov-
</p>
<p>ernments of diamond producing and importing countries would exchange only 
</p>
<p>sealed packages of diamonds; traffickers in conflict diamonds would face criminal 
</p>
<p>prosecution; and exporting countries violating its terms could be expelled from the 
</p>
<p>scheme, in effect blocking their trade revenues. Backed by public opinion, the

</p>
<p>Kimberly Process was the result of a collaboration between the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>governments, NGOs, and diamond producers. Not only did it succeed in curtailing 
</p>
<p>trade in conflict diamonds, but it aided in the stabilization and development of frag-
</p>
<p>ile countries.21
</p>
<p>Some MNCs in the extractive sector, D&rsquo;Esposito was coming to believe, appeared 
</p>
<p>ready to act as more responsible corporate citizens and even to take concrete steps. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found some companies were doing their own analyses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They had seen 
</p>
<p>the writing on the wall&rdquo; about sustainability and increasing consumer involvement, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the luxury industry. For example, the mining company Rio Tinto was 
</p>
<p>spearheading the Global Mining Initiative, which initiated a dialogue with stake-
</p>
<p>holders. To D&rsquo;Esposito, this suggested that a more inclusive approach was becom-
</p>
<p>ing possible, relying on a network of groups&nbsp;&ndash; local activists, governments at various 
</p>
<p>levels, and media, but also for-profit corporations&nbsp;&ndash; to pursue Earthworks&rsquo; goals in 
</p>
<p>negotiations with MNCs. &ldquo;We would start with pressure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but then try to 
</p>
<p>collaborate if the [target] corporation should demonstrate some willingness to work 
</p>
<p>with us.&rdquo; It was a stick and carrot approach.
</p>
<p>One key collaborator was Keith Slack, a campaign activist with Oxfam America. 
</p>
<p>According to D&rsquo;Esposito, &ldquo;He had the best early ideas. Earthworks needed him 
</p>
<p>because we had weaknesses, we were small with limited reach&hellip; and lacked a well- 
</p>
<p>known brand&rdquo; among NGOs. As such, Earthworks was able to combine its substan-
</p>
<p>tive expertise in the industry with Oxfam&rsquo;s ability to mobilize international protests 
</p>
<p>against specific corporations or sectors via its regional and global activist networks. 
</p>
<p>Raising awareness about the mining accident in Baia Mare, Romania, had been one 
</p>
<p>of their early successes.
</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Esposito and Slack began to work with civil society leaders worldwide to 
</p>
<p>establish a set of &ldquo;Golden Rules&rdquo; for responsible mining that would form the basis 
</p>
<p>of both a public advocacy campaign and segue into an engagement with mining 
</p>
<p>companies and others in the supply chain. This included an in-depth analysis of best 
</p>
<p>practices&nbsp; &ndash; a &ldquo;Framework for Responsible Mining&rdquo;&nbsp; &ndash; that was co-sponsored by 
</p>
<p>Tiffany &amp; Co. By 2002, in addition to other initiatives, the efforts of D&rsquo;Esposito, 
</p>
<p>Slack and other NGOs culminated in the No Dirty Gold campaign, which employed 
</p>
<p>protest action as a means to leverage the industry to open negotiations.
</p>
<p>By early 2004, No Dirty Gold had introduced the Golden Rules pledge (see 
</p>
<p>Exhibit 13.2), to which signatories would commit themselves on a voluntary basis, 
</p>
<p>in effect refusing to buy gold from suppliers that failed to respect human rights and 
</p>
<p>its environmental criteria for mining. By signing, retailers acknowledged that they 
</p>
<p>felt &ldquo;morally obligated&rdquo; to address these issues. It was an unmistakable acknowl-
</p>
<p>edgment that gold suppliers were susceptible to pressure from consumer groups, 
</p>
<p>setting a precedent for that sector of the mining industry.22 The eventual goal was to 
</p>
<p>create a multi-stakeholder system (of retailers, mining companies, manufacturers,

</p>
<p>and NGOs), similar to those that existed for wood products and diamonds, to inde-
</p>
<p>pendently verify compliance with the Golden Rules.23 No Dirty Gold, they believed, 
</p>
<p>would open the way to further dialogue with leaders from civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>and industrial groups.
</p>
<p>By late 2005, 17 of the world&rsquo;s most important retailers had signed on&nbsp;&ndash; most on 
</p>
<p>the luxury end, including Tiffany &amp; Co. and Cartier. But Walmart, Sears and Target 
</p>
<p>had not. &ldquo;That was when we initiated our &lsquo;leaders and laggards&rsquo; strategy,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Esposito 
</p>
<p>said, according to which additional public pressure would be brought to bear. 
</p>
<p>Walmart, he knew, might be attempting to change, but its managers so far had failed 
</p>
<p>to respond to letters from the campaign.
</p>
<p>In February, 2006 Earthworks and Oxfam named Walmart a No Dirty Gold &ldquo;lag-
</p>
<p>gard&rdquo; in a full page ad in the New&nbsp;York Times. After extensive discussions with 
</p>
<p>Assheton Carter, Dee Breazeale extended an invitation on his recommendation to 
</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Esposito, Slack and a few others to meet.
</p>
<p> The Vancouver Dialogue
</p>
<p>Conservation International (CI) was a NGO with a history of dialogue and negotia-
</p>
<p>tion with MNCs as a stakeholder; CI did not engage in protest campaigns against 
</p>
<p>corporations from the outside but chose instead to work with them closely and dis-
</p>
<p>creetly. CI&rsquo;s association with Walmart had begun in 2002, when biologist Peter 
</p>
<p>Seligman, co-founder and CEO of CI, began to cultivate a friendship with Sam 
</p>
<p>Walton&rsquo;s eldest son, Robert Walton, a member of the company&rsquo;s board. In 2004, this 
</p>
<p>led to a consulting arrangement with CI, which was engaged to investigate opportu-
</p>
<p>nities and make recommendations for sustainability initiatives at the company.24
</p>
<p>Assheton Carter had been attempting unsuccessfully to engage Walmart since 
</p>
<p>2003. He was tired of the lack of response and had felt tempted to move on to other 
</p>
<p>projects. Nonetheless, he hoped, the consulting arrangement might open up the com-
</p>
<p>pany. The moment, in his view, was unusually propitious. &ldquo;There was a shift in the 
</p>
<p>concept of CSR [corporate social responsibility],&rdquo; he said. It was moving, he believed, 
</p>
<p>from a kind of elitist concern&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;of carping NGOs&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; to a more democratic movement 
</p>
<p>involving direct pressure from consumer activists in new areas, such as conflict dia-
</p>
<p>monds, rare hardwoods, and sea resources. One method, he continued, was to attack 
</p>
<p>the brand of large MNCs in an effort to get them to direct their managers and business 
</p>
<p>partners to act in a more ethical manner. Then his CI unit, the Center for Environmental 
</p>
<p>Leadership in Business (CELB), could bring innovative approaches for sustainability 
</p>
<p>to corporations. According to Carter, CI was not directly paid for its advice, but instead 
</p>
<p>received donations in a general conservation fund. &ldquo;Campaign NGOs play a vital 
</p>
<p>role,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but are only part of a bigger process.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Even more important, according to Carter, was a shift in focus: &ldquo;We are not just 
</p>
<p>looking at environmental impacts like the &lsquo;carbon footprint&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but also at

</p>
<p>the core business itself. That is the way to establish strategic sustainability.&rdquo; In other 
</p>
<p>words, he saw it as his mission to move CSR into the heart of a company&rsquo;s business 
</p>
<p>model from the peripheral, somewhat esoteric concerns that NGOs had long pur-
</p>
<p>sued. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t understand the business model,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;you are not 
</p>
<p>going to get anywhere. It&rsquo;s the starting point for real dialogue.&rdquo; Otherwise, he cau-
</p>
<p>tioned, public relations concerns tended to dominate the results for MNCs, with 
</p>
<p>simple actions tacked on after the business decisions had already been made. &ldquo;We 
</p>
<p>want to open their eyes to sustainability. CELB&rsquo;s goal is transformational,&rdquo; that is, 
</p>
<p>to embed CSR and sustainability into everyday decision-making as a matter of 
</p>
<p>course. This could only occur, he argued, when it was a component of the business 
</p>
<p>model and hence part of the company&rsquo;s incentive systems that rewarded managers 
</p>
<p>for performance. To do so, Carter explained, &ldquo;We would offer advice that was rele-
</p>
<p>vant to their business concerns, but that also fit our mandate regarding sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity&hellip; We were business consultants, but with our own agenda.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>From the first months of 2004, Carter had patiently attempted to establish a pro-
</p>
<p>fessional relationship with Breazeale. &ldquo;I began to educate Dee on the issues,&rdquo; he 
</p>
<p>recalled. &ldquo;It was very hard. She rarely had any time&nbsp;&ndash; every time we talked she was 
</p>
<p>multi-tasking on something else. I wanted to know that she was taking what I had to 
</p>
<p>say seriously, that she was committed. Sometimes weeks or months would go by 
</p>
<p>with no response, but she always came back to me.&rdquo; Carter was attempting to engage 
</p>
<p>her in a number of processes:
</p>
<p>&bull; To gain her trust as an advisor.
</p>
<p>&bull; To provide basic information and context on the issues, in particular those beyond 
</p>
<p>the normal purview of her job.
</p>
<p>&bull; To explain what she could expect from the various NGOs.
</p>
<p>&bull; To bring Walmart into formal, constructive dialogues with other stakeholders.
</p>
<p>&bull; To gain access to other sustainability leaders within Walmart.
</p>
<p>&bull; To keep concrete goals and missions at the forefront of the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>concerns.
</p>
<p>&bull; To formulate and help to implement company strategies.
</p>
<p>In spite of the frustration, Carter had persisted. Eventually, this resulted in 
</p>
<p>Breazeale&rsquo;s decisive action on his advice about rubies from Burma. Carter con-
</p>
<p>cluded: &ldquo;Dee wanted to engage with NGOs who were challenging Walmart&hellip;I 
</p>
<p>facilitated conversations and kept things going.&rdquo; They discussed many issues, 
</p>
<p>including the idea of creating a line of jewellery that had traceable source 
</p>
<p>materials.
</p>
<p>In June, 2006 Carter organized a meeting in Vancouver, Canada, which included 
</p>
<p>mining companies, Tiffany &amp; Co., Walmart, various NGOs, and many others. It was 
</p>
<p>the culmination of a long effort to bring the stakeholders together. At the meeting, 
</p>
<p>he introduced D&rsquo;Esposito and Slack to Breazeale and her team. It was, he explained, 
</p>
<p>a mixture of information and putting the companies on notice that there was a con-
</p>
<p>cerned activist community ready to take action. The suggestions from NGOs 
</p>
<p>included signing onto the &ldquo;Golden Rules&rdquo; standards for responsible mining and 
</p>
<p>N. C.&nbsp;Smith and R. J. Crawford</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>253
</p>
<p>better controlling the use of recycled gold. They were suggesting putting the buying 
</p>
<p>power of Walmart behind direct sourcing from specific mines as a way to create a 
</p>
<p>dedicated chain-of-custody, that is, establish tighter control over the behaviour and 
</p>
<p>policies of all segments in the supply chain.
</p>
<p>For their part, most of the mining companies wanted to get the NGOs off their 
</p>
<p>backs and saw that a line of traceable products might go some way to accomplish 
</p>
<p>that. In addition, because Walmart and Tiffany &amp; Co.&nbsp;&ndash; the end-users of mining 
</p>
<p>products&nbsp;&ndash; were pushing the mining companies to work with NGOs, some recog-
</p>
<p>nized the advantages in doing so. Interestingly, according to Carter, the retailers 
</p>
<p>learned that the mining companies Rio Tinto and Newmont were far more vertically 
</p>
<p>integrated than they had thought.
</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Esposito and Slack took on the development of mining standards through 
</p>
<p>IRMA, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, a multi-stakeholder effort 
</p>
<p>that included mining companies, trade organizations, NGOs, retailers, and individ-
</p>
<p>ual consultants. Walmart indicated that, should IRMA come up with &ldquo;good stan-
</p>
<p>dards&rdquo;, it would incorporate them into its sustainability requirements. Nonetheless, 
</p>
<p>it would be an extremely ambitious multi-stakeholder effort.
</p>
<p>The Vancouver meeting was exciting for Breazeale. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t plugged in at all to 
</p>
<p>the NGOs and activist groups surrounding mining. I needed to educate myself to 
</p>
<p>tear apart every step of the process and determine what path to take,&rdquo; Breazeale 
</p>
<p>recalled, &ldquo;so we [within Walmart] began to put our heads together and engage lead-
</p>
<p>ing mines and manufacturers to work together for a common goal.&rdquo; Her chief col-
</p>
<p>laborator was Assheton Carter, who had become intimately involved with all aspects 
</p>
<p>in the formulation of her sustainability initiatives at Walmart, including not just the 
</p>
<p>provision of information, but also writing, editing, and commenting on documents 
</p>
<p>for both public and confidential, in-company purposes, and sometimes even the 
</p>
<p>implementation of its sustainability strategy. But Walmart did not pay him. While 
</p>
<p>CI received funds from Walmart, as Oxfam and other NGOs did from many corpo-
</p>
<p>rations, Carter emphasized, his unit did not. &ldquo;My job never depended directly on 
</p>
<p>Walmart funding,&rdquo; he said.
</p>
<p> Working Together
</p>
<p>After the Vancouver meeting, Breazeale and Carter invited D&rsquo;Esposito and Keith 
</p>
<p>Slack of Oxfam to the Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters to continue the dialogue. 
</p>
<p>They began to brainstorm about what might be done concretely, perhaps even in the 
</p>
<p>creation of sustainable product lines. &ldquo;It was the most intense half-day meeting&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>really good,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Esposito recalled, &ldquo;because it was all operational people leading 
</p>
<p>it&hellip; We told them what we are doing, they asked me what they should do, where 
</p>
<p>they might get traction.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>However, the IRMA effort turned into a time-consuming and frustrating episode 
</p>
<p>that advanced at a glacial pace. A big issue was that Breazeale&nbsp;&ndash; and the Walmart col-
</p>
<p>leagues to whom she was delegating tasks&nbsp;&ndash; sometimes lacked the mental space to 
</p>
<p>come up with ideas in new areas beyond their regular jobs. Unlike some other SVNs, 
</p>
<p>13 Walmart: Love, Earth (A)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>254
</p>
<p>they were not given any additional resources to fulfil their sustainability mission. For 
</p>
<p>their part, the NGOs found the commitment onerous as well. According to Keith Slack, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It required a real investment of time. NGOs don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth or resources to 
</p>
<p>do this&hellip; We had to educate them and continually follow up on things, like reviewing 
</p>
<p>the countless draft documents for the standards that we were trying to negotiate.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Slack was disappointed in the mining standards that were emerging from 
</p>
<p>Walmart. He also felt increasingly worried that the involvement of Oxfam might 
</p>
<p>somehow co-opt the organization. &ldquo;We did not,&rdquo; he emphasized, &ldquo;wish to see 
</p>
<p>Oxfam&rsquo;s participation as an endorsement of the results. We wanted to talk and con-
</p>
<p>tribute, but that was as far as it went.&rdquo; He did not want to be paid as a consultant, in 
</p>
<p>his view, &ldquo;because that would have led to a loss of independence.&rdquo; CI, he believed, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;could no longer publicly be critical when it is necessary.&rdquo; Regarding the results, 
</p>
<p>like many participants and observers, Slack was disappointed that representatives of 
</p>
<p>the local communities were not sufficiently consulted as they went forward. &ldquo;Even 
</p>
<p>though we had a constructive dialogue that allowed expert input, it wasn&rsquo;t inclusive 
</p>
<p>enough,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;No one could speak on behalf of the miners or the people 
</p>
<p>living nearby.&rdquo; Furthermore, Slack was concerned about the disposal of waste gen-
</p>
<p>erated in the mining process (or &ldquo;tailings&rdquo;) as well as the regulation of mining in 
</p>
<p>environmentally protected areas. Beyond that, he remained suspicious about 
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s motives. &ldquo;The most important issue,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;was the treatment 
</p>
<p>of Walmart labourers [employees]. I began to wonder if the whole sustainability 
</p>
<p>effort was a way to deflect attention from that.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>According to Carter, &ldquo;Keith was unwilling to compromise on these issues, even 
</p>
<p>when we [at CI] felt that we were making significant progress.&rdquo; In Carter&rsquo;s opinion, 
</p>
<p>the outcome had much more positive potential. &ldquo;We spent a lot of time trying to 
</p>
<p>push the players to think,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want them to take something off 
</p>
<p>the shelf. We wanted to create something together, to be part of a process. Walmart 
</p>
<p>saw itself as only a retailer, but we were arguing that there were immense scale-up 
</p>
<p>possibilities, that the company could have a major impact by changing the way that 
</p>
<p>it did things. They were listening.&rdquo; For many months, Carter was also striving to 
</p>
<p>convince mining companies&nbsp;&ndash; which were reluctant to deal with retailers because 
</p>
<p>they were unaccustomed to collaborating with that segment of the supply chain&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>into a traceable jewellery deal. Nonetheless, he was confident that Breazeale could 
</p>
<p>make things happen with Walmart&rsquo;s market clout.
</p>
<p>By the end of the summer, Breazeale and Carter were championing the creation of 
</p>
<p>a line of jewellery, later named &ldquo;Love, Earth&rdquo;, all inputs of which would be able to be 
</p>
<p>traced to sustainable sources and practices. Carter took on the role of doing much of 
</p>
<p>the legwork for the project; beyond sustainability issues, this included input into the 
</p>
<p>formulation of the business case, its sales goals, and the documents to present their 
</p>
<p>ideas within the company. In particular, with a long-term commitment by vertically 
</p>
<p>integrated suppliers, Carter and Breazeale advanced the arguments that a traceable line 
</p>
<p>would carry a number of business advantages: (1) the creation of an exclusive jewel-
</p>
<p>lery line differentiated by its pioneering sustainability and unique design; (2) a less 
</p>
<p>complex (or &ldquo;truncated&rdquo;) supply line, based on closer relations with suppliers, that 
</p>
<p>N. C.&nbsp;Smith and R. J. Crawford</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>255
</p>
<p>should reduce prices of input materials, as well as (3) assure a more secure supply line, 
</p>
<p>and (4) provide a guarantee of product quality for the duration of the arrangement.
</p>
<p>In October 2006, the initiative suffered a number of serious setbacks. The IRMA 
</p>
<p>negotiations on standards for an industry-wide certification system had apparently 
</p>
<p>stalled. Carter reluctantly concluded that voluntary criteria only for Walmart, such as 
</p>
<p>those in No Dirty Gold, would have to do for the time being. This would generate con-
</p>
<p>troversy among NGOs, some of which wanted to continue to push for a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>voluntary agreement rather than a one-off commitment from Walmart. For other NGOs, 
</p>
<p>not even a comprehensive voluntary agreement would be enough: they wanted govern-
</p>
<p>ments to impose stricter regulations on the mining companies. Soon thereafter, Keith 
</p>
<p>Slack exited the process, convinced that he could accomplish more from the outside. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps worst of all, Dee Breazeale left Walmart to open her own consulting business, 
</p>
<p>which threatened to derail the entire process. If her attention had appeared sporadic, at 
</p>
<p>least she had known how to get things done from within the Walmart culture.
</p>
<p> Love, Earth
</p>
<p>After some initial scepticism, Breazeale&rsquo;s successor, Pam Mortensen, became inter-
</p>
<p>ested in the traceable jewellery project, though she needed to get up to speed on the 
</p>
<p>issues. In Carter&rsquo;s view, they were starting over once again &ldquo;from square 1&rdquo;. It was, 
</p>
<p>he reasoned, just part of the cost of doing business with Walmart. As soon became 
</p>
<p>evident, Mortensen brought her own inspiration and energy to the process. In 
</p>
<p>Carter&rsquo;s opinion, Walmart was prepared to invest in a real business initiative with 
</p>
<p>sustainability at the heart of its business model. On Mortensen&rsquo;s recommendation, 
</p>
<p>Walmart finally signed the Golden Rules pledge in early 2007, and was taken off the 
</p>
<p>Earthworks/Oxfam &ldquo;laggard&rdquo; list.
</p>
<p>By April, 2007, a concrete business plan emerged for a line of traceable jewel-
</p>
<p>lery, from mining to delivery for sale. The jewellery line would be designed and 
</p>
<p>manufactured for Walmart, carrying an exclusive brand name. It would meet 
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s sustainability goals, yet would not charge consumers any kind of green 
</p>
<p>premium. Instead, the jewellery line would be affordable in accordance with 
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s &ldquo;everyday low prices&rdquo;, ranging approximately from less than $US 40 to 
</p>
<p>no more than $150, which was not appreciably different from the other jewellery 
</p>
<p>lines that Walmart currently sold. Finally, as a measure of success, traceable jewel-
</p>
<p>lery should account for 10% of all Walmart sales in both gold and diamond jewel-
</p>
<p>lery by 2010, which based on public figures would add up to approximately $US 60 
</p>
<p>million and $US 50 million respectively. &ldquo;Pam was a brilliant champion for the 
</p>
<p>idea,&rdquo; Carter said. The plan was finalized and approved in early 2008, though some 
</p>
<p>pieces still had yet to fall into place, not least of which was assuring traceability.
</p>
<p>For his part, Carter continued in his role as an advisor, coaching Mortensen on 
</p>
<p>how to interact with NGOs, but also helping her to implement the project. &ldquo;We con-
</p>
<p>tinued to run it together,&rdquo; Carter explained, in a relationship based on trust and mutual 
</p>
<p>respect rather than obligation. Soon, Carter was writing documents on behalf of 
</p>
<p>Mortensen and Walmart, from internal memos to press releases and web materials. 
</p>
<p>13 Walmart: Love, Earth (A)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>256
</p>
<p>Carter also maintained relations with NGOs and the mining companies. Regarding 
</p>
<p>Slack&rsquo;s departure, he understood that Oxfam as an organization no longer felt the 
</p>
<p>outcomes likely to emerge from the traceable jewellery line would be sufficient to 
</p>
<p>warrant its continued participation. In other words, Oxfam found that too many com-
</p>
<p>promises had been made. According to Carter, &ldquo;Campaign NGOs face a real dilemma. 
</p>
<p>Their opposition to MNC practices is their legitimate strategy to raise awareness 
</p>
<p>about irresponsible business and is how they build their support base. They are com-
</p>
<p>fortable and effective being unequivocal opponents, but they aren&rsquo;t sure how to con-
</p>
<p>structively engage corporations and, at the same time, satisfy their supporters.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Moreover, in his view, Slack and many other NGOs lacked the technical exper-
</p>
<p>tise in the extractive sectors that CI and Earthworks had developed. CI, for example, 
</p>
<p>specifically sought to engage scientists and academics in their work. In Great 
</p>
<p>Britain, Carter had earned a PhD in business strategy and sustainability in the inter-
</p>
<p>national mining sector; he was able to write a business plan that would be profitable 
</p>
<p>and do the right thing in accordance with his vision.
</p>
<p>Without agreed-upon voluntary standards, Carter decided that separately negoti-
</p>
<p>ated criteria, a &ldquo;mini-certification scheme&rdquo;, was a viable option that also had the 
</p>
<p>potential to revitalize other efforts. (See Exhibit 13.3 for Walmart Mining Criteria.) 
</p>
<p>Carter based them largely on the Golden Rules pledge. To verify compliance, third- 
</p>
<p>party inspectors were supposed to be allowed into the supply chain. Unfortunately, 
</p>
<p>no matter what commitments they established, Carter acknowledged that some crit-
</p>
<p>ics would denounce these as greenwashing from both Walmart and the mining 
</p>
<p>companies.
</p>
<p>There were also technical challenges to overcome. The principal problem with 
</p>
<p>traceability was the complexity of inputs: any product could have hundreds of entry 
</p>
<p>points along the supply chain. When it came to gold, the challenge was to differenti-
</p>
<p>ate sources when the refining process typically destroyed the possibility of tracing 
</p>
<p>its origins: the output from multiple mines and even recycled gold were melted and 
</p>
<p>mixed together into an indistinguishable molten mass. Furthermore, the labour 
</p>
<p>practices of subcontractors in both processing and manufacturing jewellery would 
</p>
<p>come under scrutiny and hence had to be controlled. Finally, Walmart&rsquo;s implemen-
</p>
<p>tation and oversight would also receive vigorous attention from activists. Would it 
</p>
<p>be acceptable if any of these inputs were &ldquo;ethically tainted&rdquo;, that is, came from 
</p>
<p>questionable sources that employed unsustainable mining practices, paid the miners 
</p>
<p>too little, or even used methods of transportation damaging to the environment? It 
</p>
<p>appeared that there were few straightforward answers to these challenges. Any 
</p>
<p>claim that Walmart made was guaranteed to receive minute critical scrutiny.
</p>
<p>The mining companies Rio Tinto and Newmont agreed to join the effort as long- 
</p>
<p>term partners. Newmont was highly vertically integrated: it had its own mines and 
</p>
<p>refineries. This meant that Newmont could arrange to refine all the gold that it 
</p>
<p>mined, making virtually all inputs traceable, from mining to manufacturing. Rio 
</p>
<p>Tinto, it turned out, could accomplish a similar arrangement for both gold and dia-
</p>
<p>monds. Both companies would use only their own mines (gold from the US, dia-
</p>
<p>monds from Australia), which guaranteed their responsibility and control over all 
</p>
<p>raw material inputs. To offer transparency to consumers&nbsp;&ndash; the opportunity to follow

</p>
<p>the overall process for sustainability&nbsp; &ndash; Carter found a software engineer, Tim 
</p>
<p>Wilson, who had created a wiki for collaborative input at each stage in the supply 
</p>
<p>process. Carter introduced Wilson to Mortensen, who was leading the effort within 
</p>
<p>Walmart for Love, Earth. With her support, Walmart signed them on to the project 
</p>
<p>immediately. Finally, the jewellery manufacturer Aurafin, which was owned by the 
</p>
<p>philanthropist Warren Buffett, was brought on board.
</p>
<p>Though Mortensen soon moved on to another job, her successor Gail Campbell 
</p>
<p>oversaw the final stages of development of the Love, Earth line of jewellery. By 
</p>
<p>going online, a consumer could input the batch number of their purchase and 
</p>
<p>instantly learn where and how it was mined, where it was refined, and who manu-
</p>
<p>factured it, including details of the conditions they worked in. (See Exhibit 13.4, 
</p>
<p>Love, Earth Press Release; Exhibit 13.5, Process Comparison; Exhibit 13.6, Online 
</p>
<p>Trace It; Exhibit 13.7 Example of Walmart Love, Earth products and Trace It Batch 
</p>
<p>Query Box.) Launched in July 2008, the process and product line were touted as a 
</p>
<p>precedent-setting breakthrough, receiving wide coverage in the popular press.

<p>Exhibit 13.1 Sustainable Value Network Goals
</p>
<p>Background. The Sustainable Value Networks were launched during the Business 
</p>
<p>Sustainability milestone meeting on November 9th, 2005. Since that time, most of 
</p>
<p>the Sustainable Value Networks have had a Network kickoff meeting with suppliers, 
</p>
<p>supplier&rsquo;s suppliers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government organi-
</p>
<p>zations, academics and other external thought-leaders.
</p>
<p>Network Deliverables. All Networks have completed the following deliverables:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identified six quick wins
</p>
<p>&bull; Identified at least one innovation project
</p>
<p>&bull; Developed an understanding of the systemic barriers to achieving &ldquo;big game 
</p>
<p>change&rdquo; (reaching full sustainability) and identified the critical success factors 
</p>
<p>for overcoming those barriers
</p>
<p>&bull; Developed a draft product scorecard or metrics
</p>
<p>Progress. In general, momentum and excitement continues to build and most net-
</p>
<p>works have framed exciting projects that deliver business value and environmental 
</p>
<p>performance. In addition to material economic and environmental benefits, com-
</p>
<p>mon business benefits include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Expanding the internal network of working relationships&nbsp;&ndash; Associates are work-
</p>
<p>ing across organizations and functions to solve issues;
</p>
<p>&bull; Developing an external network of stakeholders, relationships and capabilities 
</p>
<p>related to listening, internalizing and acting on new information and perspec-
</p>
<p>tives; and,
</p>
<p>&bull; Increased employee engagement and job satisfaction.

</p>
<p>Opportunities. The common challenges that many networks are experiencing are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Resource issues&nbsp;&ndash; time commitments associated with learning our way into a 
</p>
<p>new way of working;
</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to maintain ongoing productive relationships with external stakeholders 
</p>
<p>outside of Network meetings;
</p>
<p>&bull; Getting suppliers out of an incremental mindset and truly innovating; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Gap between current global procurement function and a strategic, global sourc-
</p>
<p>ing function, designed to address sustainability issues and build capabilities in 
</p>
<p>the extended supply chain.
</p>
<p>In addition, we see opportunities to accelerate progress and results through com-
</p>
<p>petency building on key skills, including systems thinking, strategic planning and 
</p>
<p>fact-based decision making.

<p>Exhibit 13.2 Golden Rules Pledge
</p>
<p>The Golden Rules
</p>
<p>The Golden Rules are a set of criteria for more responsible mining. These criteria 
</p>
<p>are based on broadly accepted international human rights laws and basic principles 
</p>
<p>of sustainable development.
</p>
<p>The No Dirty Gold campaign developed the Golden Rules based on extensive 
</p>
<p>reviews of documents and research prepared by the mining industry, civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, scientific researchers and technical experts, international bodies such

<p>as the UN, the World Bank&rsquo;s Extractive Industries Review, and other multi- 
</p>
<p>stakeholder processes.
</p>
<p>The No Dirty Gold campaign calls on mining companies to meet the following 
</p>
<p>basic standards in their operations:
</p>
<p>&bull; Respect basic human rights as outlined in international conventions and laws.
</p>
<p>&bull; Obtain the free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) of affected communities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Respect workers&rsquo; rights and labor standards, including safe working conditions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that operations are not located in areas of armed or militarized conflict.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that projects do not force communities off their lands.
</p>
<p>&bull; Refrain from dumping mine waste into oceans, rivers, lakes, or streams.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that projects are not located in protected areas, fragile ecosystems, or 
</p>
<p>other areas of high conservation or ecological value.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that projects do not contaminate water, soil, or air with sulfuric acid 
</p>
<p>drainage or other toxic chemicals.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cover all costs of closing down and cleaning up mine sites.
</p>
<p>&bull; Fully disclose information about social and environmental effects of projects.
</p>
<p>&bull; Allow independent verification of the above.

<p>Exhibit 13.3 The Walmart Voluntary Criteria
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s Initial Environmental and Social Sourcing Criteria for Mining and 
</p>
<p>Metals in Jewellery
</p>
<p>The vision of the JSVN is to provide Walmart and Sam&rsquo;s Club customers with afford-
</p>
<p>able, quality products that aim to have a net positive effect on the environment and 
</p>
<p>human health. We plan to achieve this vision by striving to ensure the application of the 
</p>
<p>following principles in our supply chain throughout the life-cycle of our products:
</p>
<p> 1. Incorporation of lifecycle analysis into business decisions planning and man-
</p>
<p>agement plans and to recover material value wherever possible
</p>
<p> 2. Continual improvement of health and safety performance
</p>
<p> 3. Efficient production and minimization of waste and pollution
</p>
<p> 4. Safe disposal and management of waste and hazardous materials
</p>
<p> 5. Protection of ecological functioning, ecosystem services and important biodi-
</p>
<p>versity and respect legally designated protected areas
</p>
<p> 6. Respect for the rights of individuals, indigenous peoples and communities
</p>
<p> 7. Respect for employee rights regarding safe working conditions and terms of 
</p>
<p>employment
</p>
<p> 8. Contribution to the sustainable development of communities affected by 
</p>
<p>operations
</p>
<p> 9. Transparency of sources and assurance of sustainability performance

</p>
<p> 10. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and treaties at international, 
</p>
<p>national, state and local level
</p>
<p>Long Term Goal: 100% of gold, silver and diamonds used in the jewellery sold in 
</p>
<p>Walmart will be sourced from mines and produced by manufacturers that meet 
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s sustainability standards and criteria. We also want to incorporate recycled 
</p>
<p>materials used in the jewellery by working with mines, refineries and manufacturers.
</p>
<p>Target: By 2010 achieve 10% traceability of all diamonds, gold and silver in 
</p>
<p>jewellery sold in Walmart from mines, refineries and manufacturers meeting 
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s sustainability standards and criteria.
</p>
<p>Long Term Goal&nbsp;&ndash; Packaging: All jewellery poly-bags to be bio-degradable and 
</p>
<p>convert all pallets and all boxes to recyclable materials.
</p>
<p>How the Walmart Sustainability Criteria Are Developed
</p>
<p>To help us develop the Walmart criteria for responsible mining we reviewed 
</p>
<p>many existing commitments and continuing initiatives on sustainable mining, 
</p>
<p>including the International Council of Mining and Metal&rsquo;s (ICMM) Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Framework, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>(IRMA) emerging standards for mine site assurance, the ten Gold Rules put forward 
</p>
<p>by the No Dirty Gold Campaign, the standards championed in the Framework for 
</p>
<p>Responsible Mining, and the International Financial Organization&rsquo;s (IFC) environ-
</p>
<p>mental and social performance standards. While we have made all final decisions as 
</p>
<p>to these criteria, over many months, we engaged and sought input from a wide 
</p>
<p>spectrum of experts, some of which included Rio Tinto Ltd., Newmont Mining 
</p>
<p>Corporation, Conservation International, Earthworks, World Wildlife Fund, and 
</p>
<p>Oxfam America. We sought input from these organizations because of their per-
</p>
<p>spective and energy they bring to advancing the sustainable development agenda. In 
</p>
<p>line with their institutional policies, we understand that the valuable participation of 
</p>
<p>these organizations does not imply their endorsement of the Love, Earth product 
</p>
<p>line or sourcing criteria.

<p>Exhibit 13.4 Love, Earth Press Release
</p>
<p>Walmart Adds a New Facet to Its Fine Jewellery Lines: Traceability
</p>
<p>Retailer Partners with Conservation International to Launch Love, Earth Jewellery 
</p>
<p>and New Sustainable Criteria
</p>
<p>Bentonville, Ark. and Arlington, Va.&nbsp; &ndash; July 15, 2008&nbsp; &ndash; Walmart Stores, Inc. 
</p>
<p>(NYSE: WMT) today launched Love, Earth&reg; jewellery, its first completely trace-
</p>
<p>able fine jewellery line available exclusively at Walmart stores, Sam&rsquo;s Club loca-
</p>
<p>tions and on Walmart.com and Samsclub.com.
</p>
<p>Marking a shift in how affordably-priced fine jewellery is produced and sold, the 
</p>
<p>new line is the result of collaboration between Walmart, Conservation International 
</p>
<p>(CI) and Walmart&rsquo;s supply chain partners. It will give customers the ability to trace 
</p>
<p>the path of their Love, Earth jewellery from mine to store by simply going online.
</p>
<p>Love, Earth is the retailer&rsquo;s first step toward having all of the gold, silver and 
</p>
<p>diamonds used in the jewellery sold in its Walmart stores and Sam&rsquo;s Club locations 
</p>
<p>come from mines and manufacturers that meet Walmart&rsquo;s sustainability standards 
</p>
<p>and criteria. The criteria address both environmental, human rights and community 
</p>
<p>issues. By 2010, the retailer aims for at least 10&nbsp; % of its jewellery offerings to 
</p>
<p>achieve these standards.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walmart recognizes that our customers care about the quality of their jewellery 
</p>
<p>and its potential impact on the world,&rdquo; said Pam Mortensen, vice president and divi-
</p>
<p>sional merchandise manager for Walmart. &ldquo;With Love, Earth, customers are getting 
</p>
<p>an affordable and beautiful piece of jewellery that also helps sustain resources and 
</p>
<p>strengthen communities.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>27 There may be unique situations where the development of a mine can benefit or enhance the 
conservation and protection of valuable ecosystems. If it can be demonstrated that material benefit 
from mining will occur&nbsp; &ndash; a &lsquo;net-positive&rsquo; outcome&nbsp; &ndash; development in these areas may be 
considered.

<p>Consumers can visit www.loveearthinfo.com to see where their Love, Earth jew-
</p>
<p>ellery was mined and manufactured, and learn about suppliers&rsquo; environmental and 
</p>
<p>social programs. The site also offers information about the standards used to select 
</p>
<p>suppliers and ensure the entire process is more sustainable.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;With its considerable influence, market reach and commitment to sustainability, 
</p>
<p>Walmart has brought together like-minded suppliers, mining companies and conser-
</p>
<p>vation partners to work together to build a traceable jewellery supply chain at an 
</p>
<p>impressive scale,&rdquo; said Dr. Assheton Stewart Carter, Senior Director of Business 
</p>
<p>Policies and Practices at Conservation International.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope others in the jewellery industry will follow this leadership example 
</p>
<p>and thus enable consumers to make simple choices that benefit the environment and 
</p>
<p>mining communities when shopping for jewellery.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>To create Love, Earth, Walmart selected partners in the mining and jewellery 
</p>
<p>manufacturing industries that already demonstrated environmental and social lead-
</p>
<p>ership, including Rio Tinto, an Anglo-Australian mining company; Newmont 
</p>
<p>Mining Corporation, a global gold producer headquartered in Denver, Colorado; 
</p>
<p>and Aurafin, a Florida-based jewellery manufacturer. During the next phase of the 
</p>
<p>partnership, the retailer plans to expand the number of approved mining and manu-
</p>
<p>facturing suppliers and introduce diamonds in the Love, Earth line.
</p>
<p>The Walmart Love, Earth collection is made from 10 karat gold and sterling sil-
</p>
<p>ver; the Sam&rsquo;s Club collection from 14 karat gold and sterling silver. Each collec-
</p>
<p>tion includes fashion pendants, hoop earrings, bangles and fashion beads. Created 
</p>
<p>with gold and silver, the Love,
</p>
<p>Earth collection is designed to symbolize the Earth&rsquo;s elements and based on the 
</p>
<p>precepts of recycle, reduce, and respect.

<p>14Shell Nigeria: Changing the&nbsp;Community Engagement Model
Onajomo&nbsp;Akemu, Alexandra&nbsp;Mes, and&nbsp;Lauren&nbsp;Comiteau
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Since the 1950s, Shell&rsquo;s subsidiary in Nigeria, the Shell Petroleum Development 
</p>
<p>Company (SPDC),1,2 has invested in the communities that host its oil and gas opera-
</p>
<p>tions. SPDC has built schools, roads, boreholes, community centres and other infra-
</p>
<p>structure. In 2005, SPDC management decided to implement a new community 
</p>
<p>development strategy that would flip the old model on its head by making the local 
</p>
<p>communities the drivers of development projects with Shell providing technical and 
</p>
<p>financial support. Gloria Udoh, now Social Investment and Local Content Advisor at 
</p>
<p>Shell The Hague&mdash;or as she describes it, a &ldquo;change management professional&rdquo;&mdash;was 
</p>
<p>tasked with implementing the new model. At the time, Udoh was a community devel-
</p>
<p>opment officer at SPDC.&nbsp;She recalls that &ldquo;interestingly, most of the resistance didn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>come from within Shell, where senior management supported the change. It was 
</p>
<p>local leaders and communities,&rdquo; says Udoh, who objected. &ldquo;Sometimes when you 
</p>
<p>hear &lsquo;legacy,&rsquo; most people hear about it from a positive context. But in our own case, 
</p>
<p>we learned to use legacy negatively. We went in there with a huge pile of unfulfilled 
</p>
<p>projects. So at first, they [the communities] did not even want to talk to us.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>1 The focal company in the case is SPDC.&nbsp;SPDC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch 
Shell. SPDC focuses on onshore and shallow water oil and gas production in the Niger Delta. 
Royal Dutch Shell and the companies in which it owns investments are distinct entities. For con-
venience, we use the word &ldquo;Shell&rdquo; to refer to these companies.
2 In addition to SPDC, Royal Dutch Shell has interests in three other companies operating in 
Nigeria. They are (a) Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production (SNEPCo)&mdash;holds interests in four 
deep water oil and gas blocks; (b) The Nigeria Liquefied Gas Company&mdash;produces liquefied natu-
ral gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids for export. Royal Dutch Shell owns 25.6% equity stake; and 
(c) Shell Nigeria Gas Limited (SNG)&mdash;distributes gas domestically in Nigeria.</p>

</p>
<p>After years of broken promises, environmental mishaps and conflict in the Niger 
</p>
<p>Delta region, local communities had little trust in Shell. The company had suffered 
</p>
<p>an image problem not only in Nigeria but worldwide, especially after the 1995 
</p>
<p>execution of Ogoni environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni 
</p>
<p>leaders. In the wake of the Saro-Wiwa execution, SPDC increased its engagement 
</p>
<p>with local communities. However, by the early 2000s, SPDC&rsquo;s engagement model 
</p>
<p>was becoming unsustainable. The company needed to figure out a more effective 
</p>
<p>way of meeting the needs of local communities without compromising its long term 
</p>
<p>position in the region. Udoh was part of a team recruited by former USAID [United 
</p>
<p>States Agency for International Development] advisor Deirdre LaPin, then working 
</p>
<p>as a consultant for Shell. Under LaPin&rsquo;s leadership, the team decided to adopt a 
</p>
<p>bottom-up approach to development, what LaPin calls the &ldquo;leveraged buy-in.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>How does one gain the trust of communities who have been at the short end of 
</p>
<p>broken promises for decades? How does one convince local communities that sus-
</p>
<p>tainable models of development would benefit them more in the long run than pater-
</p>
<p>nalistic handouts? And how does one make the case to SPDC managers that 50&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>of corporate social responsibility practices need to be overhauled? These were the 
</p>
<p>questions that Udoh and her team grappled with as they proposed and implemented 
</p>
<p>what they conceived as a more sustainable model of engagement between Shell and 
</p>
<p>its host communities in the Niger Delta.
</p>
<p> Shell in&nbsp;Nigeria: A&nbsp;Brief History
</p>
<p> A Huge Footprint in&nbsp;Nigeria
</p>
<p>Shell has been active in Nigeria since 1936. Begun as Shell D&rsquo;Arcy, the company 
</p>
<p>was licensed to explore for oil 2&nbsp;years later. The company discovered oil in 1956 at 
</p>
<p>Oloibiri in the Niger Delta. In 1958, Shell exported Nigeria&rsquo;s first barrels of oil to 
</p>
<p>international markets. Today, the footprint of this oil and gas corporation in Nigeria 
</p>
<p>is vast. SPDC&rsquo;s operations in the Niger Delta are spread over 20,000&nbsp;km2. According 
</p>
<p>to Shell, they include &ldquo;a network of more than 6,000&nbsp;km of flowlines and pipelines, 
</p>
<p>60 oil fields, 700 producing wells, 60 flowstations, seven gas plants and two major 
</p>
<p>oil export terminals at Bonny and Forcados.&rdquo; SPDC&rsquo;s operations cover a region 
</p>
<p>comprising about seven million people (Shell Nigeria 2014a, b, c, d). Figure&nbsp;14.1 
</p>
<p>shows a map of Nigeria and the extent of Shell&rsquo;s operations in the Niger Delta.
</p>
<p>Shell has a huge economic impact in Nigeria. SPDC, for instance, as the largest 
</p>
<p>acreage of any oil company in the country. The company produces about 40% of 
</p>
<p>Nigeria&rsquo;s crude oil output&mdash;the source of 95% of the country&rsquo;s export earnings and 
</p>
<p>45% of the country&rsquo;s gross domestic product (Central Intelligence Agency 2014). 
</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2012, SPDC paid about $42 billion in taxes and royalties to the 
</p>
<p>Nigerian government (Shell Nigeria 2014). In Nigeria as a whole and the Niger 
</p>
<p>Delta in particular, Shell is a fact of life.
</p>
<p>However, the story of Shell and the oil industry in Nigeria has not always been a 
</p>
<p>positive one. Despite its oil wealth, Nigeria remains a poor and highly unequal

</p>
<p>country. In last six decades, oil companies (Shell included) and the Nigerian gov-
</p>
<p>ernment have generated billions of dollars in oil revenue. Yet the majority of the 
</p>
<p>population has benefited little from oil wealth. According to the World Bank, 84% 
</p>
<p>of Nigeria&rsquo;s population lives on less than $2 a day. Only 40% of the adult female 
</p>
<p>population is literate and 54% of the country&rsquo;s wealth accrues to the top quintile of 
</p>
<p>the country&rsquo;s income distribution (World Bank 2014).
</p>
<p>In addition to poverty and inequality, the Niger Delta, the region from which oil 
</p>
<p>is extracted, has suffered severe environmental damage. Available records indicate 
</p>
<p>that about 6900 oil spills occurred between 1976 and 2001 resulting to a loss of 
</p>
<p>about three million barrels of oil (United Nations Development Programme 2006). 
</p>
<p>In 2011, the UNEP [United Nations Environment Program] conducted an in-depth 
</p>
<p>assessment of pollution in Ogoniland, a region of the Delta in which SPDC had 
</p>
<p>operations. The report found that pollution from over 50&nbsp;years of oil operations &ldquo;has 
</p>
<p>penetrated further and deeper than many may have supposed&rdquo; (United Nations 
</p>
<p>Environment Programme 2011a, b, p.&nbsp;6). The report called for a clean-up that could 
</p>
<p>take 25&ndash;30&nbsp;years. In the preamble to the report, the UNEP stated:
</p>
<p>The environmental restoration of Ogoniland could prove to be the world&rsquo;s most wide- 
</p>
<p>ranging and long term oil clean-up exercise ever undertaken if contaminated drinking 
</p>
<p>water, land, creeks and important ecosystems such as mangroves are to be brought back to 
</p>
<p>full, productive health (United Nations Environment Programme 2011a, b).
</p>
<p>While Shell maintains that is addressing the UNEP reports recommendations on 
</p>
<p>Ogoniland (Shell Nigeria 2014), the company denies culpability for most spills in 
</p>
<p>the Niger Delta. According to SPDC, 70% of oil spills between 2005 and 2011 were 
</p>
<p>due to sabotage or &ldquo;bunkering&rdquo;&mdash;the practice by which locals steal crude oil from 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s pipelines. Nevertheless, Shell has faced multiple lawsuits pertaining 
</p>
<p>to polluted farmland and rivers. In 2013, the district court in The Hague (Netherlands) 
</p>
<p>ruled that SPDC was liable for pollution in a village in the eastern Niger Delta in 
</p>
<p>2006&ndash;2007 because the company had failed to take sufficient measures to prevent 
</p>
<p>sabotage of its pipelines (Sekularic and Deutsch 2013; Bekker and Prelogar 2013).
</p>
<p> SPDC and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Nigerian Government
</p>
<p>SPDC is the operator of a joint venture partnership called a joint operating agree-
</p>
<p>ment (JOA) involving the following partners (participatory interests are in brack-
</p>
<p>ets): the Nigerian government-owned National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC, 
</p>
<p>55%), Shell (30%), Total E&amp;P Nigeria Ltd., a subsidiary of France&rsquo;s Total (10%), 
</p>
<p>and Italian oil company ENI subsidiary, Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited (5%) 
</p>
<p>(Shell Nigeria 2014). The JOA covers over 30 oil mining licenses (OMLs) in the 
</p>
<p>onshore and shallow water (swamp) zones in the Niger Delta.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>273
</p>
<p> How the&nbsp;Partnership Works
</p>
<p>The JOA governs the relationship between the joint venture partners, budget approval 
</p>
<p>and funding of participations by the partners. All partners share the cost of operation 
</p>
<p>based on their participatory interest. Thus, SPDC bears 30% of the operating cost of 
</p>
<p>the joint venture while the NNPC bears the lion share of those costs (55%).
</p>
<p>In addition to the JOA, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) governs the 
</p>
<p>fiscal incentives of the partners such as revenue allocation, payment of taxes and 
</p>
<p>royalties and partner margins (Ameh 2005). Under the MOU, partner companies 
</p>
<p>(SPDC included) received a fixed margin within an oil price range $15&ndash;19 per bar-
</p>
<p>rel. The &ldquo;split of the barrel&rdquo;3 (Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria 
</p>
<p>2004, p.&nbsp;7), i.e. how much each partner receives as a function of oil prices in the 
</p>
<p>MOU in the years 2000&ndash;2004 is shown in Fig.&nbsp;14.2.
</p>
<p>For instance, at an oil price of $19 per barrel, the Nigerian government (repre-
</p>
<p>sented by the NNPC) receives $13.78 per barrel in taxes, royalties and equity share. 
</p>
<p>Of the remaining $5.22, operating cost and capital expenditure account for about $4 
</p>
<p>per barrel and a margin of $1.22 per barrel is shared among the other participants 
</p>
<p>(Shell, Total and Agip). At $30 per barrel, the Nigerian government receives $24.13 
</p>
<p>per barrel, while the margin shared by the Shell, Total and Agip increases to $1.87 
</p>
<p>and remains at this level beyond $30 per barrel oil price.
</p>
<p>Under the JOA, the operator prepares annual work programmes and budgets 
</p>
<p>(Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation 2015). SPDC, as operator, is responsible 
</p>
<p>3 According to correspondence with knowledgeable industry insiders in 2015, the &ldquo;split of the bar-
rel&rdquo; in the JOAs has changed since 2005. Though the NNPC and its JOA partners do not release 
publicly their production costs, a combination of high oil prices in the years 2007&ndash;2014 and the 
tense security situation in the Niger Delta have led to increased production cost. For the purpose of 
the case, however, Fig.&nbsp;14.2 will suffice as an indication of how revenues from the JVs were split 
between the partners in the years 2000&ndash;2005, the time in which the case is set.

partners and Nigerian

increasing share of 
revenues from oil 
production as the oil price 
increased above $10 per 
barrel (Shell Petroleum

<p>for the day-to-day running of the agreement and has the most direct contact with 
</p>
<p>local communities covered by the OMLs in the agreement.
</p>
<p> SPDC as&nbsp;Operator of&nbsp;Joint Venture Partnership
</p>
<p>In Nigeria, an oil-dependent and highly unequal country, SPDC&rsquo;s host communities 
</p>
<p>have looked to the company to provide infrastructure such as water, electricity and 
</p>
<p>roads that the country&rsquo;s government had failed to provide, creating a situation in 
</p>
<p>which local communities depended on Shell for basic amenities. In some respects, 
</p>
<p>said LaPin, where Shell ended and the government began was hard to tell. &ldquo;The 
</p>
<p>Shell style was a colonial style. They inherited it,&rdquo; she said of the company&rsquo;s way of 
</p>
<p>dealing with local communities. &ldquo;A colonial officer and a Shell manager was not an 
</p>
<p>easy distinction to make for those living in the community.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to Shell&rsquo;s relationship with the Nigerian government&mdash;through 
</p>
<p>its partnership within the JOA&mdash;Shell has also often been seen as colluding with the 
</p>
<p>often-repressive Nigerian government. Things came to a head in the early 1990s. 
</p>
<p>Led by writer and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Ogonis, one of the 
</p>
<p>many ethnic groups in the Niger Delta, began a high-profile campaign to protest 
</p>
<p>their exclusion from the benefits of oil production and the contamination of their 
</p>
<p>land. In 1995, Saro-Wiwa and eight Ogoni leaders were captured, tried by a secret 
</p>
<p>military tribunal and executed by the government of dictator, General Sani Abacha 
</p>
<p>(British Broadcasting Corporation 1995; CNN 1995).
</p>
<p>In 1996, families of the executed Ogoni leaders filed a lawsuit against Shell. The 
</p>
<p>plaintiffs claimed that Shell had been complicit in human rights abuses including 
</p>
<p>torture and killing. Shell, however, denied the charges. After a protracted legal 
</p>
<p>battle lasting 13&nbsp;years, Shell settled the case out-of-court with a payment of $15.5 
</p>
<p>million to the plaintiffs in 2009 (Mouawad 2009; British Broadcasting Corporation 
</p>
<p>2009; CNN 2009).
</p>
<p>Given this history, by the late 1990s, Shell managers knew that the company had 
</p>
<p>to change its model of community engagement for &ldquo;its reputation and to preserve its 
</p>
<p>business,&rdquo; said LaPin.
</p>
<p> SPDC and&nbsp;Its Host Communities in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Niger Delta
</p>
<p> Community Assistance
When SPDC started operating in the Niger Delta in 1958, the rules for community 
</p>
<p>assistance were simple. &ldquo;We would just say, &lsquo;OK, this community probably will 
</p>
<p>need water and we&rsquo;ll do the water for them,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Trevor Akpomughe, a Social 
</p>
<p>Performance Specialist at SPDC, of the corporation&rsquo;s top-down approach to social 
</p>
<p>responsibility. But, by the late 1990s, that method, carried out for decades, was 
</p>
<p>proving unsustainable. Udoh adds:
</p>
<p>O. Akemu et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>275
</p>
<p>We were making the decisions for them [the local communities]&hellip;and also constructing the 
</p>
<p>projects, so to a very large degree, their participation was not there in terms of [them say-
</p>
<p>ing], &lsquo;this is what our needs are and this is how we prioritise them in terms of making a 
</p>
<p>development journey from where we are today to where we want to be tomorrow.
</p>
<p>In addition to the lack of community ownership, the thinking at Shell appears to 
</p>
<p>have shifted. Udoh, a native of the Niger Delta, felt that the issue of change was 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;very close&rdquo; to her heart. By the late 1990s, according to Udoh, &ldquo;[Shell managers 
</p>
<p>started asking,] &lsquo;are we really relating with the communities the way we ought to? 
</p>
<p>Are we involving them in the decisions we make?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Also, operational problems within Shell were tasking the paternalistic approach 
</p>
<p>to community assistance. The corporation was providing assistance to some 1000 
</p>
<p>communities in a piecemeal fashion. For every road or water project in a commu-
</p>
<p>nity, there were several project management committees, which often meant several 
</p>
<p>committees in one community. Akpomughe:
</p>
<p>The committees wanted to put as many people to manage things as possible, and 
</p>
<p>nobody was looking at it holistically. That was stretching our resources, because 
</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not resourced to do development&hellip;So that piecemeal approach was not giving 
</p>
<p>us the best benefits, and our dollar spent was not giving the community a holistic 
</p>
<p>view of how development ought to be managed. Everybody just implements and 
</p>
<p>nobody manages.
</p>
<p>According to a 2006 internal report, SPDC had committed to over 400 commu-
</p>
<p>nity development projects and had an outstanding 371 legacy projects to complete.
</p>
<p>Often, there was little coordination of the commitments that the company had 
</p>
<p>made to communities. Communities&rsquo; resistance to Shell was often legitimate. Not 
</p>
<p>only had Shell made past promises it could not keep, but the company had made 
</p>
<p>some it did not even remember. Udoh says that with so many Shell people interacted 
</p>
<p>with the communities. A courtesy call made by a Shell manager to a community 
</p>
<p>before the implementation of the GMOU could result in a promise for a classroom 
</p>
<p>or some other project. &ldquo;Sometimes when we were saying that, nobody from the 
</p>
<p>Shell side took an inventory [of the promises] and followed through,&rdquo; says Udoh of 
</p>
<p>the lack of central coordination and integration. &ldquo;But the community keeps its own 
</p>
<p>record. So we also had incidences [sic] like that where multiple interfaces, multiple 
</p>
<p>projects, we did not even have a record of them and we said to the community, &lsquo;No 
</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t promise that.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>But communities usually kept records of promises and demanded that Shell fulfil 
</p>
<p>them. Kudaisi, then a community manager with SPDC, explained the situation:
</p>
<p>Some of those [promises] were in the sixties &hellip;Community members would say to me, &lsquo;so 
why are you not coming back after to come and do work with us on the road or do some 
stuff? You promised us&hellip;&rsquo; And they bring out the letter [from Shell]. And I say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t 
know about that, I&rsquo;m new [to Shell]&hellip;But the communities kept saying, &lsquo;you know what; 
</p>
<p>you guys owe us this.
</p>
<p>Thus, poor coordination within the company led to broken promises and ill- 
</p>
<p>feeling among many host communities.

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>276
</p>
<p>Furthermore, when projects were finished, there was no mechanism in place to 
</p>
<p>keep them running. SPDC had to maintain the projects after completion. Udoh: 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;[When we build a classroom], it is seen as a Shell classroom. And if a light bulb 
</p>
<p>goes off, you get a phone call [from the community], &lsquo;please come and fix your 
</p>
<p>classroom&rsquo;.&rdquo; From boreholes that needed refurbishing to town hall tiles that needed 
</p>
<p>replacing. The manpower and financial expenditure of the community assistance 
</p>
<p>model proved to be costly for the company.
</p>
<p>By 2004, SPDC was under pressure to reduce expenditures and streamline oper-
</p>
<p>ations. This made it more difficult for the company to fulfil its community assis-
</p>
<p>tance obligations. Akpomughe speaking of the lack of community involvement in 
</p>
<p>projects and the corporation&rsquo;s financial commitments said:
</p>
<p>These two things walked together. The communities needed to pick up the slack, as it were. 
</p>
<p>And it was good that they picked up the slack because otherwise we would still be in the 
</p>
<p>mode where we do things for them and the [community] capacity is not built&hellip;. Development 
</p>
<p>should not be handed to them from either a company or from a government without their 
</p>
<p>participation&hellip; They need to lead their own development.
</p>
<p>But SPDC was spending considerable sums of money in its community assis-
</p>
<p>tance programmes. In 1997, according to LaPin, Shell spent $32million on com-
</p>
<p>munity assistance. This was a huge commitment, but it was coming from an oil 
</p>
<p>company that was not staffed with development professionals&mdash;and all that money 
</p>
<p>was yielding little results. LaPin said of 11 community projects she saw in the Niger 
</p>
<p>Delta, she considered only one a success. She wanted to replace the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;colonial&rdquo; approach with a community-based approach to development. &ldquo;My aim 
</p>
<p>was to change that, to set up an egalitarian, partnership-style relationship between 
</p>
<p>Shell and the community where both sides would be on equal footing.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In 2005, opposition to the oil industry took a violent turn in the Niger Delta, 
</p>
<p>threating oil revenues, the economic lifeline of the Nigerian government. Against 
</p>
<p>the backdrop of national political crises under President Olusegun Obasanjo, oil 
</p>
<p>supply disruptions and increasing militancy in the Niger Delta, an insurgency group, 
</p>
<p>the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) emerged in the 
</p>
<p>Delta. Well-armed and politically-connected to local elites, MEND demanded equi-
</p>
<p>table distribution of oil rents by sabotaging oil pipelines, kidnapped oil company 
</p>
<p>workers and killed Nigerian Army personnel (Obi 2010). It is estimated that 
</p>
<p>MEND&rsquo;s attacks led to deferment of 700,000 barrels of oil per day, roughly a third 
</p>
<p>of Nigeria&rsquo;s daily production output (Watts 2007).
</p>
<p>It was in this environment that SPDC senior management realised that the 
</p>
<p>company had to move even quicker to change its engagement model with host

<p>communities. &ldquo;Shell&rsquo;s community development programme was an attempt to 
</p>
<p>counter that force, the freedom fighters demanding control of oil resources,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>said LaPin. Shell moved quickly to implement the new model. &ldquo;They man-
</p>
<p>aged to get $60million up and running in less than a year. I had a staff of 180 
</p>
<p>including Gloria Udoh, one of the &lsquo;best and brightest&rsquo; Nigerian development 
</p>
<p>experts recruited to make the changes.&rdquo;

</p>
<p> A New Approach to&nbsp;Community Engagement
</p>
<p>What exactly should replace SPDC&rsquo;s ad-hoc often paternalistic approach to com-
</p>
<p>munity assistance? In 2005, Gloria Udoh led a team to propose a new approach to 
</p>
<p>community engagement. The team consulted various departments within the com-
</p>
<p>pany and studied the community engagement efforts of other oil companies in the 
</p>
<p>Niger Delta, other multinational companies (MNCs) operating in Nigeria and state 
</p>
<p>governments. They found a variety of approaches to community development 
</p>
<p>among these actors. For instance, some companies like telecommunications giant 
</p>
<p>MTN had a non-profit philanthropic foundation funded by the MNC to offer grants 
</p>
<p>to social, educational and developmental ends in Nigeria. One state government had 
</p>
<p>pioneered community development projects in partnership with civil society organ-
</p>
<p>isations and local communities to identify &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; projects. Udoh and her team 
</p>
<p>also found that Chevron Nigeria, a subsidiary of U.S. multinational oil company 
</p>
<p>Chevron, operating in the Niger Delta, had introduced a model, called the Global 
</p>
<p>Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) model in the wake of crises that had dis-
</p>
<p>rupted its operations in 2003.
</p>
<p>In Chevron&rsquo;s model, development programmes were open not only to its host 
</p>
<p>communities, but spread across communities associated with a &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chevron&rsquo;s model involved inclusion of development stakeholders 
</p>
<p>such as civil society groups, local governments and development agencies 
</p>
<p>(Consensus Building Institute 2008). After the study period&mdash;which involved 
</p>
<p>rounds of consultation with Chevron&mdash;Udoh&rsquo;s team recommended to SPDC leader-
</p>
<p>ship team the &lsquo;Global Memoranda of Understanding&rsquo; (GMoU) approach to com-
</p>
<p>munity engagement.
</p>
<p>GMoUs are written statements of understanding between SPDC and clusters of 
</p>
<p>local communities. Under GMoUs, SPDC agrees to provide funding and access to 
</p>
<p>development experts while the communities set their own development priorities, 
</p>
<p>plan and implement development projects. See Fig.&nbsp;14.3 for a comparison of the 
</p>
<p>GMoU model and the community assistance model of engagement.
</p>
<p>In the community assistance model, Shell signed multiple bilateral agreements 
</p>
<p>with its numerous host communities and the company was held responsible for 
</p>
<p>community development. In the GMoU model, Shell&rsquo;s &lsquo;interfaces&rsquo; with the com-
</p>
<p>munities would be reduced. The number of development projects made more man-
</p>
<p>ageable. Shell would provide funding and technical assistance for projects proposed 
</p>
<p>by communities comprising the clusters and would do so for a fixed term (5&nbsp;years) 
</p>
<p>after which the GMoU would be renewed.
</p>
<p>Importantly, in the GMoU model, a wider selection of stakeholders would be 
</p>
<p>involved in development. For instance, the local government would be involved in 
</p>
<p>the cluster development activities. Udoh and her team expected that the government 
</p>
<p>would mediate conflict between the communities. Civil society organisations [non- 
</p>
<p>governmental organisations] would also play a role, helping the communities artic-
</p>
<p>ulate better their development needs. In the GMoU approach, Shell in partnership 
</p>
<p>with state, local government and NGOs signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) 
</p>
<p>with clusters of communities forming a cluster development board (CDB).

<p>Udoh presented her proposal to SPDC&rsquo;s leadership team in mid-2006. Mutiu 
</p>
<p>Sunmonu, SPDC&rsquo;s Managing Director at the time of writing this case, was then 
</p>
<p>Executive Director for Production. He recognised the benefits of Udoh&rsquo;s proposi-
</p>
<p>tion. Udoh recalled:
</p>
<p>Getting conviction internally was easier than the implementation... Because when we did 
</p>
<p>the study, we said, &lsquo;Fine. From the study we&rsquo;ve done, we want to go very slowly.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;we 
want to do six, maybe twelve [GMoUs]. And learn from that before we replicate every-
where.&rsquo; The first reaction I had [from SPDC leadership team] was excitement, interestingly. 
And they said look, &lsquo;if you say this is going to work, do it everywhere.&rsquo; And that is also what 
caused a problem, to some degree, the challenge to some degree [was implementation]&hellip;So 
</p>
<p>that was why, after that presentation, they [SPDC top leadership team] said fine, you said 
</p>
<p>this would work, you are very convinced, I said, &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. They said, &lsquo;OK fine, you go lead the 
first implementation team.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Udoh and her team needed a pilot location. &ldquo;We started looking for other things 
</p>
<p>that would enable the community to take some responsibility off our shoulders,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>remembers Udoh. &ldquo;The turning point was late 2005 with the Gbaran-Ubie 
</p>
<p>project.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Implementation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;GMoU Model
</p>
<p> Pilot Phase Gbaran-Ubie Project
</p>
<p>The Gbaran-Ubie Integrated Oil and Gas Project (GUIOGP) covers an area of 
</p>
<p>approximately 650&nbsp;km2 in Bayelsa State in the Niger Delta (See Fig.&nbsp;14.1). It is one 
</p>
<p>of Shell&rsquo;s largest integrated oil and gas plants. It began production in June 2010. By 
</p>
<p>2011, it was supplying about a quarter of the gas produced for export and producing

</p>
<p>more than 50,000 barrels of oil a day. The project is particularly important because 
</p>
<p>it produces gas to The Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Company, a joint venture 
</p>
<p>between Shell, the Nigerian government, France&rsquo;s Total and Italy&rsquo;s ENI, which liq-
</p>
<p>uefies the gas and exports to customers in Europe, Asia and the United States. An 
</p>
<p>aerial view of the central processing facilities of the Gbaran-Ubie Project is shown 
</p>
<p>in Figs.&nbsp;14.3 and 14.4.
</p>
<p>The Gbaran-Ubie project impacts 44 distinct host communities within the proj-
</p>
<p>ect area. After lengthy consultations with the communities, SPDC grouped the com-
</p>
<p>munities into four clusters (number of communities in brackets): Gbaran/Ekpetiama 
</p>
<p>(18), Epie/Atissa (14), Okordia/Zarama (8) and Kolo Creek (4). SPDC signed a 
</p>
<p>GMoU with each cluster in 2006&ndash;2007&nbsp;in line with the GMoU approach. Figure&nbsp;14.5 
</p>
<p>shows an extract of a generic GMoU.
</p>
<p>Convincing local communities to sign up to the GMoU model was a difficult 
</p>
<p>task. Udoh and her team had to negotiate a very complex, often emotionally- 
</p>
<p>charged, implementation phase that coincided with the rise of a violent insurrec-
</p>
<p>tion in the Delta led by militant groups like MEND.&nbsp; Deploying Shell staff and 
</p>
<p>contractor staff to work on the project was difficult due to the threat of violence in 
</p>
<p>the Delta. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, Gbaran-Ubie would be a project that was executed at the 
</p>
<p>peak of the insecurity in the Niger Delta,&rdquo; adds Kudaisi. &ldquo;Nobody wanted to be 
</p>
<p>there. It was the biggest project in the worst of times.&rdquo; Some of the challenges in 
</p>
<p>the implementation are discussed.

</p>
<p>Trust between SPDC and the Communities Kudaisi who worked for Udoh 
</p>
<p>negotiating the GMoUs with the communities in the Gbaran-Ubie project recalled:
</p>
<p>It was never done before, so you really, really needed to win the trust and confidence of the 
</p>
<p>community, to do what you say you are going to do,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Grandparents talked about 
</p>
<p>Shell.., I said [to local community leaders] &lsquo;This is the new face of Shell. We all have his-
tory.&rsquo; You have to win their confidence. We had to address the issue of 50&nbsp;years of legacy.
</p>
<p>Kudaisi remembers setting a deadline for community members to check the 
</p>
<p>archives and cull their grandparents&rsquo; memories for Shell&rsquo;s promises past. In the end, 
</p>
<p>SPDC made trade-offs for promises they could no longer keep. For instance, SPDC 
</p>
<p>had promised a new electricity supply scheme in one of the communities. However, 
</p>
<p>the company did not need to make good on the promise because electricity had 
</p>
<p>already been provided by the Nigerian government. Instead, the company agreed to 
</p>
<p>fund another development project in the community. As part of the budgeting pro-
</p>
<p>cess, the company set aside funds to address all legacy issues in the communities.
</p>
<p>Clustering Communities based on Clan Affiliation For some clusters, this pro-
</p>
<p>cess was largely uncontroversial. According to Akpomughe:
</p>
<p>Communities largely are built of clans, so one of the things we needed to decide was, &lsquo;how 
</p>
<p>do we cluster communities?&rsquo; It would be easier to cluster by local governments, because 
</p>
<p>that means the units would be fewer. So we found that even within local governments, you 
</p>
<p>have various clans and tribes, and they were not historically friendly. We had also put it to 
</p>
<p>the [Bayelsa state] government who then helped with that. The communities don&rsquo;t mind 
</p>
<p>having a cluster with their own clan, so we then largely went on clan basis
</p>
<p>In other areas, however, the process was more difficult. As one interviewee 
</p>
<p>recalled, &ldquo;Some communities [in the Epie/Atissa cluster] had issues. One of the 
</p>
<p>communities was protesting that they were being attached to a larger community&hellip;
</p>
<p>that had so many facilities [on their land], that they thought they were going to be 
</p>
<p>oppressed. But then, because of the GMoU structure, which was based on what your 
</p>
<p>community is needing and also based on even development, we were able to work 
</p>
<p>together.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Aligning SPDC and Community Goals Communities often preferred visible, 
</p>
<p>tangible projects that had no apparent development impact. Akpomughe:
</p>
<p>One of the challenges we found all over [in Gbaran-Ubie] was that everybody wants a 
</p>
<p>prestige project like a town hall. But in truth, many of the communities can&rsquo;t sustain a town 
</p>
<p>hall; they don&rsquo;t have enough activities to use the town hall, for example. So the town hall is 
</p>
<p>locked [for most of the year]&hellip;and it&rsquo;s really monies that are not properly utilised, it&rsquo;s for 
</p>
<p>prestige value.
</p>
<p>SPDC&rsquo;s goal was to have the clusters embark on self-sustaining projects to gen-
</p>
<p>erate their own income. &ldquo;We thought to build human development kind of things, 
</p>
<p>but the people want &lsquo;hardware&rsquo;&rdquo;, said Akpomughe.
</p>
<p>They would want to build a road, a concrete road between the communities; nothing wrong 
</p>
<p>with that in itself! But if you look at the level of development in the community, one of the 
</p>
<p>O. Akemu et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>283
</p>
<p>things we [SPDC] looked at was that if people increase their capacity or generate income 
</p>
<p>for themselves, it&rsquo;s a much better way to spend development funding because then if they 
</p>
<p>generate income, likely their children will go to school. Their parents would be able to 
</p>
<p>afford books, could afford school uniforms, and things of that nature. We thought to build 
</p>
<p>human development kind of things like a skills acquisition program, but the people wanted 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;hardware&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>He added reflectively, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a delicate, ongoing process. How do you con-
</p>
<p>vince local communities to develop sustainable projects without appearing to 
</p>
<p>impose your ideas from above?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Equitable Distribution of GMoU funds How would a cluster of communities 
</p>
<p>allocate funds that the cluster had received from Shell? This was a particular thorny 
</p>
<p>aspect of implementing the GMoU in Gbaran-Ubie. It was not clear how to deter-
</p>
<p>mine the degree of impact on Shell&rsquo;s operations on different communities. Number 
</p>
<p>of wells? Size of infrastructure? Or length of pipelines? Some communities claimed 
</p>
<p>that they were more impacted than others because their land hosted more pipelines 
</p>
<p>than their neighbours. Other communities challenged such claims with counter 
</p>
<p>claims that their land hosted oil wells, which were more important than pipelines. 
</p>
<p>Yet other communities that did not host large infrastructure feared that they would 
</p>
<p>not get any funding from the GMoU.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the clusters were formed, community representatives had to 
</p>
<p>be elected:
</p>
<p>The first challenge was getting the governance structure in place. At the time, different 
</p>
<p>people thought that the community members of the governance structure of the GMoU were 
</p>
<p>either going to be paid by Shell or going to get some political appointment or [enjoy] some 
</p>
<p>form of patronage. It took time to explain and to educate them to know that it&rsquo;s just a service 
</p>
<p>to your society, something you do in the interest of the society. And then of course we needed 
</p>
<p>to validate, check the integrity of some of the nominees. We had to check that through the 
</p>
<p>relevant government authorities and through the traditional institutions, through the gov-
</p>
<p>ernments, and all this. At the end of the day, the nominees were confirmed and certified.
</p>
<p>Conflicting Interests within Communities Communities are not homogenous. 
</p>
<p>The interests of the traditional rulers was often at odds with those women and youth 
</p>
<p>within the communities. In some instances, traditional rulers extorted money from 
</p>
<p>contractors who built the infrastructure. One NGO worker said:
</p>
<p>Most of the projects we [the local NGO] were supervising then were infrastructural projects 
</p>
<p>and a lot of money was involved. The kings captured the contractors, the community con-
</p>
<p>tractors that were handling the projects. Why the king was able to do [such a] thing? 
</p>
<p>Because the king is the signatory to the work completion certificate. You understand that? 
</p>
<p>So then they were in a position to put pressure on the community contractors to say, &lsquo;If you 
</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give me a certain amount of money, I won&rsquo;t sign your work completion certificate.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Udoh and her team, working with local NGOs, often challenged the community 
</p>
<p>chiefs in order to increase the inclusiveness of engagement processes.
</p>
<p>Sometimes people want projects that just benefit a tiny portion of the community. So a chief 
</p>
<p>probably wants a road to go to his house. Now, the NGO will challenge that and say: &lsquo;How

<p>does this benefit the women that need to go to the market, or that need to get water? Why is 
</p>
<p>that a priority project and why is this not a priority project? (Akpomughe).
</p>
<p>Working with a New Development Actor&mdash;The State Government As shown in 
</p>
<p>Fig.&nbsp; 14.5, the GMoU governance structure included community representatives, 
</p>
<p>SPDC, state and local government, and other development actors (such as NGOs). 
</p>
<p>Unlike the NNPC that is a partner in the JOAs, the Bayelsa state government had 
</p>
<p>never been involved in SPDC&rsquo;s community engagement efforts. Getting the buy-in 
</p>
<p>of the state government for the GMoU tasked the negotiation. As one interviewee 
</p>
<p>put it:
</p>
<p>SPDC had to build trust with the state government and convince them that the GMoU 
</p>
<p>approach was going to work. &ldquo;The relationship with them [the Bayelsa state government] 
</p>
<p>started off rather... best way to say it is, we had to work slowly to develop and establish 
</p>
<p>credibility and trust. I mean, when we started off, they weren&rsquo;t antagonistic, but they started 
</p>
<p>off remaining to be convinced that we weren&rsquo;t able to deliver this.
</p>
<p> Results of&nbsp;Pilot Phase Implementation
</p>
<p>The Gbaran-Ubie pilot GMoU officially ended in December 2011. Through the 
</p>
<p>GMoU, Shell claims to have funded 151 projects of which over 100 were com-
</p>
<p>pleted. In addition, the company reports that over 80 university scholarships were 
</p>
<p>awarded as a result of the GMoU (Shell Nigeria 2011). In Fig.&nbsp;14.6, a cross section 
</p>
<p>of projects completed under the Gbaran-Ubie GMoU (as at December 2012). They 
</p>
<p>include a road, water project, an electrification project, and an 18-classroom block.
</p>
<p>Importantly for Shell&rsquo;s operations, the company did not suffer significant disrup-
</p>
<p>tion or deferment from local communities in Gbaran-Ubie despite the insurgency in 
</p>
<p>other parts of the Niger Delta.
</p>
<p> Implementing the&nbsp;GMoU Beyond the&nbsp;Pilot Phase
</p>
<p>SPDC&rsquo;s leadership team was supportive. After presenting her findings on the 
</p>
<p>Gbaran-Ubie pilot to Shell&rsquo;s leadership team, she was met with excitement by senior 
</p>
<p>leadership team. They pressured Udoh and her team to move quickly, remembers 
</p>
<p>Udoh, who wanted to slowly roll out the new model. She proposed to implement the 
</p>
<p>GMoU with 12 communities. &ldquo;They said OK, fine, if you think this will work, you 
</p>
<p>have our blessing. But don&rsquo;t do just 12. Do it everywhere! So we were now put 
</p>
<p>again under pressure, not having enough resources, even in terms of people on the 
</p>
<p>inside that could run with this.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>With lessons from the Gbaran-Ubie pilot, Udoh and her team began implement-
</p>
<p>ing GMoUs with communities in the Delta. Some of the challenges they faced are 
</p>
<p>discussed in detail below.
</p>
<p>Winners and Losers On the ground, change was resisted by those who stood to 
</p>
<p>lose the most. &ldquo;Any change means there are winners and losers,&rdquo; recalled LaPin. In 
</p>
<p>O. Akemu et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>287
</p>
<p>the old top-down system, she explained, there were Community Liaison Officers 
</p>
<p>(CLOs) who Shell sent out to explain its plans and manage the land all of which 
</p>
<p>technically belongs to the government. Shell paid local royalties for its use and the 
</p>
<p>CLOs negotiated the terms with local leaders. LaPin:
</p>
<p>We introduced parallel officers, Community Development Officers (CDOs), who were rep-
</p>
<p>resentatives of the communities and who listened and asked what they wanted.&rdquo; The CDO&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>job was to help communities act and plan together and to guide them through the process. 
</p>
<p>And importantly, they controlled the funds. The losers were the community liaison officers, 
</p>
<p>who were the primary contacts with local leaders and some of whom were not entirely hon-
</p>
<p>est. When we introduced the CDOs, it was a check on their activities and they were advocat-
</p>
<p>ing for the community. That was a new concept.
</p>
<p>The other losers were community leaders, who made the deals with the CLOs, 
</p>
<p>but were increasingly resented by the area&rsquo;s youth. &ldquo;This was a more democratic 
</p>
<p>process, so the &lsquo;big men&rsquo; were not benefiting much. It shifted the balance of power,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>said LaPin. &ldquo;But the big men had enough good sense to not resist the program, 
</p>
<p>which was beneficial to their community and ultimately to them. But they tried to 
</p>
<p>manipulate it to their advantage,&rdquo; she reflected with a laugh.
</p>
<p>Clustering Communities As was the case in Gbaran-Ubie, forming the clusters 
</p>
<p>also proved a challenge. What was the best way to cluster communities? Geographical 
</p>
<p>contiguity? Clan affiliation? What role should political boundaries play? For 
</p>
<p>instance, if a community straddled state boundaries as was often the case in the 
</p>
<p>Niger Delta, should the community be split into separate clusters in each state? &ldquo;We 
</p>
<p>had instances where communities had been at war, for like 20, 30, 40&nbsp;years and they 
</p>
<p>had never sat together,&rdquo; says Udoh of a particularly testy negotiation in Rivers State. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we wanted to put those communities in one cluster.&rdquo; Speaking of the difficulty 
</p>
<p>of clustering communities, an interviewee said to the case writers:
</p>
<p>Many of these communities, they speak different languages. There is no common history. 
</p>
<p>Nigeria is a country that is an artificial creation, we are not like Holland in that even if they 
</p>
<p>break down your [Holland] boundaries today, you would still come back together to one 
</p>
<p>another because you all are the same and you have the allegiance to one king. Sorry, in 
</p>
<p>Nigeria, there is no one king that anyone has allegiance to. It&rsquo;s a country that was created 
</p>
<p>and if we were given the choice, most of us would not be together. So that&rsquo;s the reality of the 
</p>
<p>Delta. And it&rsquo;s worse in the Delta than in other parts&hellip;So you have people speaking differ-
</p>
<p>ent languages from one village to the next. Some of them have had a history of conflict.
</p>
<p>Role of Civil Society Organisations SPDC considers this a &ldquo;weak area&rdquo; of the 
</p>
<p>GMoU model. Civil society groups like NGOs [non-governmental organisations] 
</p>
<p>working as part of the GMoU model are ostensibly independent of Shell. In princi-
</p>
<p>ple, they are charged with pursuing the best interests of the communities. During the 
</p>
<p>Gbaran-Ubie project, according to Kudaisi, NGOs attended cluster meetings to 
</p>
<p>facilitate planning. At the implementation stage, their role was to make sure the 
</p>
<p>projects hit their targets. In practice, however, under the GMoU model, the NGOs 
</p>
<p>are paid by Shell. Critics say there is a lack of long-term planning by NGOs, who 
</p>
<p>still operate in project development mode. A 2010 report commissioned by the

<p/>

</p>
<p>Ecumenical Council for Corporate Responsibility (ECCR) included this analysis 
</p>
<p>from Tracey Draper, of NGO Pro-Natura International Nigeria:
</p>
<p>Weak local NGO capacity has led to NGO staff invariably following instructions from 
</p>
<p>SPDC implementation staff. The NGOs are often unable to achieve an equal dialogue with 
</p>
<p>SPDC and as a result essentially become contractor agents, doing what they are told. The 
</p>
<p>oil industry in general, SPDC included, lacks mechanisms to partner with NGOs effectively. 
</p>
<p>It categorises NGOs as contractors, hired for services delivered in the same way that con-
</p>
<p>tractors may be hired to lay a pipe or construct a bridge. (Ecumenical Council for Corporate 
Responsibility 2010)
</p>
<p>There is also the rush to get a piece of the &ldquo;development pie&rdquo;. Draper continued, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;PNI&rsquo;s view is that SPDC evaluates NGO performance on how quickly project 
</p>
<p>implementation is completed and exploits NGO fears of losing contracts. In 
</p>
<p>response, NGOs ignore participatory principles and bypass most of the steps to 
</p>
<p>complete projects&rdquo; (Ecumenical Council for Corporate Responsibility 2010).
</p>
<p>Yet NGOs may be playing a role that local state actors have neglected to play. 
</p>
<p>Kudaisi:
</p>
<p>Just like it&rsquo;s done everywhere else, each community is supposed to have a plan. That&rsquo;s why 
</p>
<p>you have what you call [it a] &ldquo;local&rdquo; government, but local government in Nigeria doesn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>really exist. &hellip;. That&rsquo;s why there is a role, that&rsquo;s the gap that is now filled by the NGOs. 
</p>
<p>Actually, the best would have been to get a local government functionary to get the engi-
</p>
<p>neers, work with the communities and come and plan it, get Shell and other oil companies 
</p>
<p>to kind of put money in the pot and get it done with contribution from [local] government.
</p>
<p> Nembe: An&nbsp;Exemplar Case
</p>
<p>Sometimes getting local communities to the negotiating table was near impossible. 
</p>
<p>One such case was with the Nembe, a group of SPDC&rsquo;s host communities in the 
</p>
<p>Niger Delta. Udoh says she remembers the Nembe negotiations as if they happened 
</p>
<p>yesterday. &ldquo;I still remember the first meeting. The chief said to me, &lsquo;Please leave. 
</p>
<p>We are not willing to discuss with you if you are not going to address the outstand-
</p>
<p>ing electricity project.&rsquo; It was rough&rdquo;. Udoh appeared to face a particular disadvan-
</p>
<p>tage: she was a woman acting on behalf of a mistrusted corporation within in a 
</p>
<p>conservative patriarchal community. The negotiations for the GMoU between Shell 
</p>
<p>and the Nembe lasted for a year.
</p>
<p>Despite the acrimony that attended negotiating the Nembe GMoU, Udoh holds it 
</p>
<p>up as &ldquo;one of the most successful we have.&rdquo; According to Udoh, SPDC has since 
</p>
<p>begun work on the electricity project that the Nembe chief referred to during her 
</p>
<p>first meeting with the community. Also, &ldquo;SPDC and Niger Delta Development 
</p>
<p>Commission have also partnered to complete a road linking Nembe to other parts of 
</p>
<p>state.&rdquo; (See map in Fig.&nbsp;14.1.) The cluster development board (CDB) (see Fig.&nbsp;14.3) 
</p>
<p>consisting ten communities signed the GMoU in 2008.
</p>
<p>Some of the Nembe GMoU projects, notes Udoh, were self-sustaining. &ldquo;They 
</p>
<p>[the Nembe communities] became smart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For instance, they have a 
</p>
<p>O. Akemu et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>289
</p>
<p>transport business, they have a printing and publishing business, they have a guest 
</p>
<p>house. So the various things they have done have helped them to generate income to 
</p>
<p>add to what they receive. And they also have started engaging other donors to see if 
</p>
<p>they can get funding&hellip;the local government at some point also contributed funds. 
</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I say it is the most successful [GMoU].&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In 2010, the Nembe CDB became a licensed NGO: Nembe City Development 
</p>
<p>Foundation (NCDF). A report by Shell Nigeria singled out the NCDF for praise:
</p>
<p>Nembe City Development Foundation (NCDF) in Bayelsa State [a state in the Niger Delta] 
</p>
<p>received a total of $90,000 as counterpart funding from a partnership between PACT 
</p>
<p>Nigeria, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Foundation 
</p>
<p>for Partnership Initiative in the Niger Delta (PIND) under the Advocacy, Awareness and 
</p>
<p>Civic Empowerment (ADVANCE) programme. The funding received was used for a capac-
</p>
<p>ity building programme &hellip; for all GMoU Clusters in Bayelsa State. (Shell Nigeria 2013)
</p>
<p> Has GMoU Model Been Successful?
</p>
<p>By the end of 2012, SPDC had implemented GMoU agreements with 33 clusters 
</p>
<p>covering over 349 communities in the Niger Delta. The company also claims that it 
</p>
<p>committed $117 million to these clusters and that nine of the 33 cluster develop-
</p>
<p>ment boards (CDBs) are registered foundations (Shell Nigeria 2013). But has the 
</p>
<p>GMoU been successful in achieving the goal of community self-reliance? &ldquo;In a 
</p>
<p>sense it was successful,&rdquo; said LaPin. &ldquo;There are better relations with the oil- 
</p>
<p>producing communities, better development in the communities and they are more 
</p>
<p>empowered to plan their projects.&rdquo; It is unclear whether there is systematic evidence 
</p>
<p>to support LaPin&rsquo;s claims.
</p>
<p>What appears certain, however, is that some GMoUs have been more successful 
</p>
<p>than others. Udoh says of the GMoUs that they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;had some brilliant results, some 
</p>
<p>mixed results, and the weak ones are in the minority.&rdquo; Udoh continued: &ldquo;So if you 
</p>
<p>were to put it on a 80/20 kind of thing, the weak ones would be 20.&rdquo; In a presenta-
</p>
<p>tion to the SPDC leadership, Udoh stated that some GMoUs were not successful 
</p>
<p>due to &ldquo;to lack of community organisational capacity, poor utilisation of funds and 
</p>
<p>exclusion of some community members.&rdquo; Furthermore, while the local govern-
</p>
<p>ments play a mediating role, they have not yet committed funds into the GMoU 
</p>
<p>clusters. There is also a lack of trust in the government on the part of the local com-
</p>
<p>munities and the NGOs are sometimes seen as doing Shell&rsquo;s bidding.
</p>
<p>How does one convince local communities that are mistrustful of Shell to change 
</p>
<p>from a mind-set of dependency to one of self-sufficiency? How does a manager win 
</p>
<p>the trust and convince communities to work together in a complex situation like the 
</p>
<p>Niger Delta&rsquo;s? How does a manager align interests of corporate and community 
</p>
<p>actors in a situation where mediating institutions such as local and state govern-
</p>
<p>ments are ineffective? These are the challenges that Gloria Udoh and her team wres-
</p>
<p>tled with as they implemented the GMoU model.

<p>15Economy of&nbsp;Mutuality: Equipping the&nbsp;Executive Mindset for&nbsp;Sustainable 
Business
</p>
<p>Kevin&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Jackson
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Market economy (Gregory and Stuart 2004, pp.&nbsp;25&ndash;27) is the orthodox frame of 
reference for many businesses, dictating how business has traditionally been, and 
still is, taught in executive business education. A market economy frame of refer-
ence drives mainstream corporate strategy. It sets the stage for how business activity 
is understood and valued by executives, managers, and numerous other stakeholders 
in private and public institutions alike.
</p>
<p>Social economy, by contrast, encompasses cooperatives, mutual societies, non-
profit organizations and foundations. The social economy frame of reference recog-
nizes economic sectors based upon charities and collective not-for-profit initiatives 
(Mook et&nbsp;al. 2007, p.&nbsp;17).
</p>
<p>Yet the moral crisis underneath global economic collapse, heightened mistrust of 
market capitalism, patterns of unsustainability, excessive consumerism, inequality 
and social unrest occurring alongside of a rising interest in social enterprise, solidar-
ity, and global justice suggest it is time to rethink the conventional market economy/
social economy divide.
</p>
<p>Numerous businesses traditionally following a short-term shareholder wealth 
maximization approach are rethinking the relationship between financial perfor-
mance, sustainability, and social responsibility. Today, companies stand in need of 
embracing shifting social expectations about the purpose of business, and some 
leaders are reconsidering the implications of these shifts for corporate strategy. 
More and more, leaders and managers are cultivating new skillsets together with a 
deepened understanding of social needs and an enhanced appreciation of the ulti-
mate nature and purpose of business and the real foundations of economic value.  </p>

</p>
<p>As well, firms are being challenged to cultivate new ways of collaborating across 
the profit-nonprofit divide as traditional boundaries become blurred by new forms 
of enterprise exemplifying features from both market economy and social economy 
(Dees 1998; Boyd et&nbsp;al. 2009; Billis 2010). Behind this hybridization of business 
enterprises is a blending of a commercial exchange logic, characteristic of the for- 
profit sector, with a gift logic typified by the nonprofit sector. Whereas the logic of 
commercial exchange is conventionally driven by principles of profit maximization, 
mutual gains, and the pursuit of financial sustainability, the logic of gift is conven-
tionally driven by principles of charity, solidarity, and the pursuit of social sustain-
ability. Accordingly, this chapter presents economy of mutuality,1 as a conceptual 
blueprint for business leadership oriented to merging financial and social 
sustainability.
</p>
<p>The chapter is structured as follows. First the idea of economy of mutuality is 
introduced. Second a schema categorizes business enterprises under the umbrellas 
of for-profit enterprise, social enterprise, and nonprofit enterprise (see Diagram 
15.1). Then, three levels of business ends are distinguished: (1) the proximate end; 
(2) a higher pro-social end; (3) the highest end-state. Fourth, an ends-oriented anal-
ysis of the archetypes is given. The proximate end, considered in the context of an 
archetype-specific inquiry, reveals the respective aims of separate genres of busi-
ness enterprises: for-profit enterprises, social enterprises, and non-profit enter-
prises. The pro-social end aims higher, considering the nature and purpose of 
business not just from an economic standpoint but from a social point of view. At 
this level principles of mutual benefit, shared value and gratuitousness are identi-
fied as embedded across archetypes in varying degrees. Finally, the question of 
what the highest end- state of business is, or ought to be, is explored through a 
discussion of five key ideas: social solidarity and interdependence, cultural capital, 
homo reciprocans, common good, and virtue. This analysis supports the proposi-
tion that the ultimate end-state of business is to advance reciprocity and integral 
human development.
</p>
<p> Economy of&nbsp;Mutuality
</p>
<p>Economy of mutuality envisions a new understanding of business enterprise, chal-
lenging the assumption that the chief purpose of business is to maximize profit 
(Duska 1997; Handy 2002, p.&nbsp;51).
</p>
<p>Not only does this unproven assumption hoodwink countless economists, busi-
ness leaders, and laypeople, it stifles deeper discussion about the authentic purpose 
</p>
<p>1 The concept should not to be confused with the John Kay&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;economics of mutuality&rdquo; 
(Kay 1991). Some ideas in this chapter originated in a paper delivered at a workshop entitled 
&ldquo;Teleology and Reason in Economic and Social Affairs,&rdquo; conducted at Blackfriars Hall, University 
of Oxford in 2014. Parts of the argument are developed further in my article &ldquo;Economy of 
Mutuality: Merging Financial and Social Sustainability,&rdquo; 133(3) Journal of Business Ethics, 499&ndash;
517 (2016).

</p>
<p>of business. On the contrary, economy of mutuality, while ceding the significance of 
profit as a success indicator, posits that from the standpoint of global sustainability, 
the pursuit of profit is at the service of a higher purpose.
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, economy of mutuality fits within streams of research compre-
hending economic life as multilayered and occurring in various structures&nbsp;&ndash; social, 
legal, political, cultural&nbsp; &ndash; that together form a more complex whole (Kropotkin 
1902/2009; Polanyi 1944/2001; Hirst 1994; Nee and Swedberg 2005; Buğra and 
Arğatan 2007; Heinberg 2011). Economy of mutuality draws upon virtue ethics, 
linking it to classical and neoclassical economic writings, and extending it to con-
temporary trends in global business (such as microfinance and social enterprises) 
springing from a sustainability paradigm (Daly and Cobb 1990; Wals 2007) and 
seeking to merge financial and social imperatives of business (Paine 2003). Economy 
of mutuality sees businesses as contributors to integral human development, mutu-
ality, and reciprocity.
</p>
<p>Market transactions are based on an exchange of equivalents, whether in the 
form of barter or money. Yet business is not reducible to a system of market 
exchanges, but flourishes in a wider social context. So economy of mutuality pro-
vides breathing space within and alongside the market for economic activity con-
ducted by participants freely choosing to act from motivations other than pure 
profit-taking, still creating economic value in the process.
</p>
<p>Markets have the important task of enabling persons to deploy contracts in regu-
lating their relations as they exchange goods and service of equivalent value between 
them. This is clearly a vital step towards satisfying many needs and desires of mar-
ket participants. But markets as such are often disengaged from society. Market- 
based decisions are not motivated or constrained directly by social custom and legal 
strictures, not to say ethical norms, and even less, virtue and the common good.
</p>
<p>Therefore, economy of mutuality sets forth rudiments for a new way of under-
standing business: rethinking not only the higher purpose of enterprise, but also 
reflecting upon how business contributes to (or takes away from) the common good 
of the society in which it is engaged.
</p>
<p>A possible objection might question the need for such an approach, asserting a 
stakeholder approach (Phillips 1997; Freeman et&nbsp;al. 2010) will bring about the right 
balance between business and society. But stakeholder thinking is flawed in accept-
ing at face value the interests and claims of various stakeholder groups indepen-
dently&mdash;in isolation from one another&mdash;without considering their deeper 
connections as part of the larger human community. So unless situated in a compre-
hensive view of humanity, stakeholder thinking runs the risk of neglecting to regard 
each stakeholder as a person that has, not simply external material and instinctive 
dimensions, but interior and spiritual dimensions as well. (Goodpaster 2011, p.&nbsp;13).

</p>
<p> Reconsidering the&nbsp;End State of&nbsp;Business
</p>
<p>Consistent with the spirit of Aristotle&rsquo;s inquiry (Aristotle 1941) about the ultimate 
purpose of human life, we may ask: What is the end-state of business activity? 
(Abela 2001; Solomon 2004). Is there some characteristic end or purpose or raison 
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre of conducting business? What, in general, does business do that is the most 
valuable?
</p>
<p>First we need to be clear about what we understand business to be. To gain clar-
ity, we can look at fundamental archtypes of business along with proximate ends 
associated with them. In penetrating further to specify their respective higher ends, 
we will continue to heed the conventional categories established by the archetypes 
(i.e. for-profit vs. non-profit; financial value vs. social value). But later, in directing 
attention toward discernment of the ultimate end, or telos, we will, consistent with 
a holistic approach, witness an erosion of traditional categorizations to some extent.
</p>
<p> Business Archetypes
</p>
<p>Consider a triad of business archetypes in which alternative emphasis goes to ele-
ments of profitability and financial independence (market economy) on one hand, 
and poverty alleviation and solidarity (social economy) on the other.
</p>
<p>Archetype 1. Business enterprises are run mainly as for-profit institutions to the 
end of being financially sustainable in the long term. Financial self-reliance is a 
precondition of a firm&rsquo;s survival and for remaining capable of continuously expand-
ing its products or services to new clientele. Important as a company&rsquo;s social mis-
sion may be, it is sublimated to profit-making capabilities to ensure the firm serves 
the interests of its shareholders.
</p>
<p>Archetype 2. The social and financial missions of business enterprises are merged; 
a coordination of social and financial functions is at the heart of the &ldquo;promise&rdquo; of the 
company as a sustainable enterprise. To be sure, a business firm has a fundamentally 
economic character. Accordingly, reasonable efficiency in its management is 
expected: covering operational costs and realizing some form of added value, sur-
plus or profit. On the other hand the sustainability paradigm for business emerging 
over the past several decades presupposes that companies are expected to uphold 
and even champion social policies. Nevertheless, while the pursuit sustainability 
presents special challenges for businesses, there is no necessary or incompatibility 
between the joint pursuit of social and financial objectives.
</p>
<p>Archetype 3. Businesses (such as some microfinance institutions and the 
Economy of Communion project) are run with principal allegiance to social mis-
sions&nbsp;&ndash; such as outreach to the poor, environmental production and promoting other 
facets of sustainability. The moral justification for business requires staunch com-
mitment to doing good. Profit is necessary and explicitly intended as a condition to 
keep doing good. The social outreach objective ought not to be imperiled by the sort 
of corruptive tendencies that sometimes attend market-driven business activities, as 
seen for instance, in instances of mission drift, exorbitant interest rates, and group 
</p>

<p>297
</p>
<p>lending abuses that involve microfinance institutions exploiting indigent people to 
increase profitability.2
</p>
<p>The above archetypes express divergent ways of understanding alternative 
generic strategic directions for individual business enterprises. For instance, 
Archetype 1 represents the strategic orientation of a traditional profit-maximizing 
corporation such as GE or IBM in the 1970s. Archetype 2, by contrast, expresses the 
current strategic direction of a sustainability oriented firm such as Google.org or 
Timberland. Archetype 3 captures the strategic direction of enterprises such as 
Grameen Bank and Focolare-inspired organizations.
</p>
<p>The first of these archetypes is sometimes been held up as the model or ideal for 
the nature and purpose of business as such. However, today even some profit- 
maximizing multinational firms are seeking to demonstrate that they can spread 
value and profits more broadly across their stakeholders and supply chain. More 
importantly, holding up only one of these archetypes&nbsp;&ndash; the for-profit model&nbsp;&ndash; as an 
embodiment of the exclusive or dominant end-point of business is a conceptual 
error. The mistake consists of falsely attributing goals or ends of specific kinds of 
business enterprises to the goal or end of business life in general. It is more perspi-
cacious to launch one&rsquo;s inquiry with the full spectrum of business enterprises at 
one&rsquo;s disposal&nbsp;&ndash; across for-profit, social enterprise, and non-profit varieties&nbsp;&ndash; and 
then inquire as to how best to account for their shared nature and purpose. It is ben-
eficial for us to question and debate what business really is, and ought to be, about. 
Proceeding from such a broadened outlook, economy of mutuality is posited as a 
moral-economic conception of preconditions of sustainable and inclusive business 
(Diagram 15.1).
</p>
<p> End-Point Examination of&nbsp;Business Archetypes
</p>
<p>For purposes of this chapter, a distinction is made between the proximate end, 
higher end, and ultimate end-state of business enterprise. By proximate end is meant 
an immediate purpose of conducting business, as understood within the particular 
archetype at hand. Here, identifying the immediate purpose of business helps to 
characterize the archetype, and is taken in a more specific and concrete sense than 
the purpose revealed in the higher end. But this higher end remains subordinate to 
yet another end, which is the absolute last end, one &ldquo;for the sake of which all other 
</p>
<p>2 Mission drift. Commercially-oriented microfinance institutions (MFIs) are sometimes identified 
as drifting away from an original mission of serving low-income clients, instead serving better-off 
clients to improve the financial bottom line (Armendariz and Szafarz 2011). An ethical issue arises 
insofar as such MFIs are found to be using poor clients mainly as a means to attaining profitability 
(Sandberg 2012). Excessively high interest rates. Interest rates charged by some MFIs can range 
between 20% and 70% per&nbsp;annum, making them higher than rates commanded by commercial 
banks (Rosenberg et&nbsp;al. 2009; Sandberg 2012). Group lending abuses. Violent collection practices 
and oppressive forms of group pressure are sometimes used by MFIs for obtaining repayment of 
group loans (Montgomery 1996; Ghate 2007).

</p>
<p>things are desired, and which is not itself desired for the sake of anything else.&rdquo; 
(Aquinas 1273/1972, 1&ndash;2, q. 2, a. 8, c).
</p>
<p>In terms of how the triad of archetypes has already been specified, it is seen that 
the proximate end of archetype 1 is profitmaking with an eye toward financial sus-
tainability. The proximate end of archetype 2 is hybrid development pursued through 
a merging of financial and social objectives. The proximate end of archtype 3 is 
alleviation of poverty through social outreach. It is possible, as will be shown, to 
discern for each archetype a higher end.
</p>
<p> For-Profits
</p>
<p>Concerning for-profit, market-based enterprise, reflective economists provide a 
range of interpretations. For example, Friedman (1962, p.&nbsp;13) states that &ldquo;the tech-
nique of the market place&rdquo; is &ldquo;voluntary cooperation of individuals.&rdquo; Similarly, 
Buchanan and Tullock (1962, p.&nbsp; 103) assert that &ldquo;[t]he raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre of market 
exchange is the expectation of mutual gains.&rdquo; What can be discerned in these 
accounts, along with those of countless other economists, is the notion that markets 
and the enterprises operating within them have some general point or purpose, and 
it is the end of mutual benefit from commercial exchange.
</p>
<p>To be sure, other economists have stressed how the market creates wealth by 
exploiting comparative advantage (Ricardo 1817), the division of knowledge 
(Hayek 1948), and increasing returns to scale (Marshall 1920). Yet all such wealth- 
producing mechanisms function through mutual benefits arising from activities of 
trade.
</p>
<p>A critic might say that the higher end of market-based, for-profit enterprise is 
attaining economic freedom. After all, a coupling of the market economy and free-
dom is a recurring theme in economics literature. Its advocates include Mill (1852), 
Hayek (1948), and Friedman (1962). But this criticism is misleading. It mistakenly 
takes economic freedom as the liberty of everyone to get at all of what they want, 
period. But economic freedom is better understood as the freedom to use one&rsquo;s own 
possessions and talents as one sees fit, remaining free to trade&nbsp;&ndash; under conditions of 
reciprocity&nbsp;&ndash; with those willing to trade in return.
</p>
<p>The common core of these understandings is captured by the logic of commer-
cial exchange. For-profit business in a market economy is aimed at the efficient 
facilitation of mutually beneficial voluntary transactions. Market economy com-
mercial transactions are seen as valuable because individuals want to make them. 
Business transactions satisfy individuals&rsquo; preferences not only because such trans-
action are wealth-creating, but also because the opportunity to make commercial 
transactions is a form of freedom. So beyond the proximate end of profitability for 
financial sustainability, we see the higher end of archetype 1 enterprise to be the 
principle of mutual benefit.
</p>
<p>An illustration of how an archetype 1 business might go about incorporating the 
concept of mutuality concretely, even without having a formal mutuality configura-
tion, is provided by the food and beverage company Mars. In the process of tracing

</p>
<p>the origins of its supply chain back to 150,000 impoverished cocoa farmers, Mars 
determined that it had a responsibility to share the fruits of its worldwide financial 
success with all those involved in its business. Accordingly, the company invested 
in new technology for cocoa growers that transfigured their way of life. The average 
cocoa yield tripled, along with associated average incomes. Consequently Mars 
gained access to more cocoa. Mars launched another mutuality project in Kenya, 
investigating how people from the poorest communities in Nairobi might be 
included in the company&rsquo;s distribution and supply chain. A key objective is for 
Kenyans to access employment and gain entrepreneurial skills. Kenyan youth, it is 
projected, will benefit as they are able to make income as a local distributor. Mars 
will benefit, in turn, because their products are marketed and distributed to new 
communities. Such mutuality initiatives comprise part of a joint research project 
between Mars and the Said Business School of Oxford University. By thus pairing 
up with Mars, academics at Said are exploring ways that a for-profit business can in 
effect be a mutual organization, yet without directly sharing ownership (Fearn 
2014).
</p>
<p> Hybrid Enterprises
</p>
<p>While hybrids ordinarily work within a market economy by operating a business, 
their ends are not exclusively financial. Their principal duty extends beyond advanc-
ing shareholder interests. Their end is both to succeed (financial sustainability) and 
to do good for the community (social sustainability). Accordingly, the hybrid enter-
prise represents a helpful structure with which to meet the needs of business organi-
zations with wider pro-social purposes (Sertial 2012, p.&nbsp;271.)
</p>
<p>Although the exact structure varies among firms, the hybrid archetype ordinarily 
links the goals of a for-profit corporation and a nonprofit charity. One illustration of 
a well-known social enterprise is Google.org, a for-profit company also dedicated to 
social benefit. Google.com funded Google.org with a grant of three million shares, 
pledging to contribute 1% of its annual profits to Google.org. A notable feature of 
Google.org is that, in addition to funding grants to support social causes, it makes 
for-profit investments, encouraging employees to participate directly in furthering 
changes in company policy. While elements of Google.org&rsquo;s structure may vary 
from those of other hybrids, it stands as a noteworthy example of a for-profit enter-
prise that assumes an explicit pro-social posture.
</p>
<p>Further inquiry into the higher end of archetype 2 enterprises may be undertaken 
by reference to emerging models such as Mohammad Yunus&rsquo; social enterprise 
(Yunus 2007, 2011) and Michael Porter and Mark Kramer&rsquo;s shared value (Porter 
and Kramer 2011).

</p>
<p> Social Enterprise
</p>
<p>According to Yunus, a social business is &ldquo;a non-loss, nondividend enterprise, cre-
ated with the intention to do good to people, to bring positive changes to the world, 
without any short-term expectation of making money out of it&rdquo; (Yunus 2007, 
pp.&nbsp;265&ndash;266). The social enterprise is a hybrid in the sense that it grows and devel-
ops as a commercial enterprise. While not intended to make profits for investors, it 
needs to generate enough income to cover its expenses, which includes providing 
adequate compensation for managers and employees. Yunus provides a description 
of the higher end of the social business:
</p>
<p>In its organizational structure, this new business is basically the same as the existing PMB 
[profit-maximizing business]. But it differs in its objectives. Like other businesses, it 
employs workers, creates goods or services, and provides these to customers for a price 
consistent with its objective. But its underlying objective&mdash;and the criterion by which it 
should be evaluated&nbsp;&ndash; is to create social benefits for those whose lives it touches (Yunus 
2007, pp.&nbsp;21&ndash;22).
</p>
<p>Profits, understood as a surplus of revenues over expenses, are anticipated, yet not 
returned to investors in the form of dividends. As Yunus puts it:
</p>
<p>The company itself may earn a profit, but the investors who support it do not take any profits 
out of the company, except recouping an amount equivalent to their original investment, 
over a period of time. A social business is a company that is cause-driven rather than profit- 
driven, with the potential to act as a change agent for the world (2007, pp.&nbsp;22).
</p>
<p>Yunus advocates a &ldquo;total delinking from the old framework&rdquo; of profit- maximization. 
(Yunus 2010, p.&nbsp; 14). What Yunus offers potential investors, who recoup funds 
invested while relinquishing a return on investment, is the chance to partake in the 
logic of gift.
</p>
<p>Here the principle of gratuitiousness is at work: personal acts of donation creat-
ing relationships in which further exchanges of various sorts become possible 
(Faldetta 2011). Besides the Grameen Bank, Yunus and his associates have diversi-
fied into other social enterprises, partnering with companies like Groupe Danone, to 
market a yogurt product that aims to ameliorate nutritional deficiencies of poor 
children at an affordable price.
</p>
<p>Yunus (2011, pp.&nbsp;33&ndash;56) used the Grameen Bank&rsquo;s expertise in social network-
ing among rural poor to develop Grameen-Danone, an independent social business. 
Operating with a social enterprise archetype, Yunus shows how it is possible to go 
beyond conventional thinking about philanthropy and corporate social responsibil-
ity (CSR). Groupe Danone is not a donor, and is Grameen-Danone is not merely a 
CSR feature of the Groupe. The new company is independent and autonomous, yet 
with substantial investment and expertise put up by Groupe Danone. The partner-
ship materialized thanks in large part to Yunus&rsquo; ability to persuade Group Danone&rsquo;s 
management that they could not participate in solving social problems effectively 
within the framework of a traditional profit-maximizing enterprise.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>302
</p>
<p>Yunus believes that people who might be donors to various charities or support-
ers of CSR policies are drawn to investing in social businesses, provided they are 
well designed and managed to produce and distribute social benefits more effi-
ciently than conventional alternatives.
</p>
<p> Shared Value
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer urge bringing business and social good together to create shared 
value. Stressing that business, operating within the traditional capitalist paradigm, 
has forfeited social legitimacy, they propose reorienting capitalism to be aimed not 
exclusively toward corporate profits with bolted-on CSR, but instead at shared value 
between corporations and community. Currently business is mired in an outmoded 
approach that thinks of
</p>
<p>value creation narrowly, optimizing short-term financial performance in a bubble while 
missing the most important customer needs and ignoring the broader influences that deter-
mine their longer-term success. How else could companies overlook the well-being of their 
customers, the depletion of natural resources vital to their businesses, the viability of key 
suppliers, or the economic distress of the communities in which they produce and sell? 
(Porter and Kramer 2011, p.&nbsp;4).
</p>
<p>The conclusion is that a radical alteration of perspective is needed to restore busi-
ness legitimacy. Under the old model, business distinguished between profit and 
social responsibility. Shared value, by comparison, is about &ldquo;creating economic 
value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and chal-
lenges&rdquo; (Id. p.&nbsp;64). The authors assert that, unlike corporate philanthropic efforts, 
this alternative approach &ldquo;is not on the margin of what companies do, but at the 
center&rdquo; (Id. p.&nbsp;64). In contradistinction from CSR, shared value mandates that all of 
an enterprise&rsquo;s budget be dedicated to shared value. For it is within shared value that 
business converges with social needs. Since it brings about a positive impact on a 
community, shared value turns out to be good for the company as well.
</p>
<p>Certainly significant changes need to come about to pave the way for shared 
value. Company leaders need to be capable of identifying social needs, and be 
equipped to work collaboratively with members of society toward ends within the 
scope of their shared interest. Enterprises with a commitment to shared value need 
to channel efforts at building economic value by creating social value. Some areas 
where shared value can be generated include: healthcare, adequate housing, better 
nutrition, assistance for aging populations, enhanced financial security, and environ-
mental preservation (Id. p.&nbsp;67).
</p>
<p>Insofar as enterprises embarked upon creating shared value need to pinpoint 
social needs, benefits and harms relevant to their respective products, Porter and 
Kramer endorse creating clusters, &ldquo;geographic concentrations of firms, related busi-
nesses, suppliers, services, providers and logistical infrastructure in a particular 
field such as IT in Silicon Valley, cut flowers in Kenya, and diamond cutting in 
Surat, India&rdquo; (Id. p.&nbsp; 72). Cluster building improves company productivity, 
</p>

<p>303
</p>
<p>competitiveness, and innovation while enhancing the local community (Id. p.&nbsp;72). 
As an illustration, Yara, a mineral fertilizer manufacturer, recognized that a dearth 
of infrastructure in many parts of Africa was an obstacle to farmers obtaining fertil-
izers and other farm products they need, as well as an impediment to getting crops 
to market. To address this need, they invested sixty million dollars to build agricul-
tural growth corridors in Mozambique and Tanzania (Id. p.&nbsp;74).
</p>
<p>One way shared value operates is provided by the case of m-pesa, a mobile bank-
ing system Safaricom introduced into Kenya. M-pesa enabled Kenyans to transact 
financial services via cell phones. The phones reduced risks of carrying and storing 
cash, which customers turned into e-money. Spouses working at a distance could 
transmit money home over the phones, reducing transportation expenses. With the 
arrival of m-pesa in Kenya, saving patterns ascended, and employment was invigo-
rated when m-pesa agents were hired. Before m-pesa, large traditional banks 
neglected the poorer population, deeming it too risky and insufficiently profitable. 
The World Bank lauded m-pesa and Safaricom for investing in the indigent. A study 
reported that, as a result of the service, rural income rose 30% (Mbarathi 2011). The 
M-pesa initiatives exemplify the hydbrid economic logic behind shared value. 
Safaricom identified a niche within which to address social needs of the poor, result-
ing in amelioration of their lives, while simultaneously creating profit for the 
company.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, in light of the predominance of hybrid economic logic in social 
businesses, the higher end of archetype 2 enterprise may be specified in terms of 
both the principle of shared value and the principle of gratuitousness.
</p>
<p> Nonprofits
</p>
<p>Let us turn to identifying the higher end of archetype 3 enterprise, the nonprofit 
charity. It may be noted that throughout Western civilization&rsquo;s history, one finds 
business ventures embodying humanitarian endeavors. Monasteries in the Middle 
Ages were incipient economic institutions. As far back as the fifteenth century, the 
Franciscans provided philanthropic impetus in the form of the Monte di Piet&agrave;, a 
precursor of the modern bank, which grew up not seeking profit, but bringing reform 
to usurious lending practices and providing charity to the impoverished (Menning 
1993, p.&nbsp;37). The public office extended moderate-rate loans to needy people. An 
underlying rationale was to benefit borrowers instead of providing profits for lend-
ers, representing a lesser evil attached to traditional money lending. The Monte di 
Piet&agrave; was dependent upon funds collected from voluntary donations by the finan-
cially privileged having no intent to recoup their monetary contributions. Those in 
need came to the Monte di Piet&agrave;, contributing some item of value in exchange for 
the financial loan. The term of the loan extended for 1&nbsp;year, representing approxi-
mately two-thirds of the borrower&rsquo;s item value. A pre-set interest rate applied to the 
loan. Any profits realized were applied to offset operating expenses.

</p>
<p>As well, the nineteenth century provided for a merging of economic and humani-
tarian objectives as the bulk of European welfare establishments and hospitals 
emerged out of spiritual associations.
</p>
<p>More recently, the Economy of Communion (EoC) project merits discussion as 
an enterprise launched in the spirit of this tradition of outreach to the poor. In addi-
tion to uniting people to advance social good and fostering a &ldquo;culture of giving,&rdquo; the 
Economy of Communion (EoC) project has a peculiar approach to distributing prof-
its Uelmen and Bruni (2006, pp.&nbsp; 647&ndash;648). Profits from an EoC enterprise are 
divided into three parts, within the discretion of the business. The first portion goes 
to the materially poor, often directly linked to Focolare networks. The second por-
tion is kept in the firm for reinvestment. The third portion is used to sustain elements 
of infrastructure that promote and preserve a &ldquo;culture of giving,&rdquo; which includes 
programs for education and formation to help people live according to its values. 
After the owner determines how much to reinvest in the company, the remainder of 
the profits can be equally divided between assisting those in need, and shaping 
activities for a culture of giving. To make sure that the needs of the materially poor 
in Focolare communities are met, profits from EoC enterprises have been supple-
mented by individual donations from Focolare members. This division of profits 
can be viewed as a useful archetype for businesses with a charitable purpose.
</p>
<p>Notably, participation in the EoC and sharing profits is totally voluntary among 
shareholders and business owners. Neither group is legally bound to give a portion 
of their profits to the EoC.&nbsp;Instead, a decision to share profits comes from people 
internal to the business itself. Such a structure provides the for-profit with the free-
dom to participate in the EoC to whatever extent it wishes, without needing to con-
form to rigid guidelines. While this freedom provides for widespread ownership, 
extending an opportunity to join to many people, it could have a negative impact on 
shareholders by generating smaller dividends. Consequently, a majority of the 
shareholders must agree with the ideals of the Focolare and be willing to forgo these 
returns. Potentially this could mean that EoC and other hybrid enterprises following 
the model would experience difficulty operating as a publicly traded company, or 
operating in situations where management is separate from ownership. On the other 
hand, the growth of ethical investment funds within the stock market could provide 
a means of raising business capital in an EoC model. Alternatively, EoC enterprises 
could advocate for shareholders to relinquish dividends altogether, donating them to 
the EoC (Gold 2010, p.&nbsp;40).
</p>
<p>The EoC departs from standard business archetypes in four ways. First, pay 
structure is organized differently in the EoC model. Under the EoC, employers 
increase wages to reward employees for extra effort extended for the company, and 
to maximize efficiency of the enterprise. Second, the EoC involves special policies 
for recruitment. EoC companies, for instance, have as one goal the hiring of more 
employees and giving employees making mistakes a second chance. The EoC busi-
ness reintegrates those facing difficulties into the work environment, yet balances 
this principle with maximizing efficiency maximization. Third, EoC companies use 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>305
</p>
<p>participative management, encouraging workers to participate in decision-making 
within the business. This might entail organizing councils, meetings, and other for-
mal structures to stimulate communication between different levels of authority. 
Lasty, EoC enterprises are proactive in cultivating a spirit of solidarity within the 
enterprise, such as hosting events to increase social interaction among employees 
including their children as well (Gold 2010 p.&nbsp;40).
</p>
<p>In consideration of the major driving force of the logic of gift at play in charita-
ble enterprise, the higher end of archetype 3 may be specified as the principle of 
gratuitousness.
</p>
<p>To summarize, although on its face Archetype 1 is often taken to presuppose that 
business is all about maximizing profits for shareholders, we see that its higher end, 
in light of the logic of commercial exchange, is the principle of mutual benefit. 
Under Archetype 2, the higher end, in light of a hybrid economic logic, is the prin-
ciple of creating shared value for a broader range of stakeholders, complemented by 
the principle of gratuitousness. For Archetype 3, the higher end relates to the logic 
of gift, taking business to be a moral calling whereby the main objective is doing 
good. Here the higher end is identified as the principle of gratuitousness. It is impor-
tant to keep in mind that, in moving to consideration of the higher end, and beyond 
to ultimate end-state, conventional borders between archetypes (profit, nonprofit; 
financial, social) tend to become more fluid. At the same time, the influence of 
broader principles (common good, gratuitousness, solidarity, interdependence, reci-
procity) tends to appear across diverse models.
</p>
<p> Architecture of&nbsp;Economy of&nbsp;Mutuality
</p>
<p>We can develop the idea of economy of mutuality further with the help of five key 
background concepts. Taken together, these key concepts point to the ultimate end- 
state of business across archetypes&nbsp;&ndash; reciprocity and integral human development 
(See Diagram 15.2 below).

</p>
<p>The five key concepts are as follows:
</p>
<p> 1. Solidarity
 2. Cultural capital
 3. Homo reciprocans
 4. Common good
 5. Virtue
</p>
<p> Solidarity
</p>
<p>Some may be surprised to learn that many classical social and economic theorists 
espoused a robust spirit of social solidarity for business. For &Eacute;mile Durkheim, social 
solidarity correlates with various types of society. Durkheim distinguished &ldquo;mechan-
ical&rdquo; from &ldquo;organic&rdquo; solidarity in his theory of the division of labor (Durkheim 
1893). In the case of mechanical solidarity, a society&rsquo;s cohesion stems from homo-
geneity. People are linked through similar work, educational backgrounds, religious 
training, and lifestyles.
</p>
<p>Mechanical solidarity typically is found in &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and small-scale societ-
ies, such as tribes, where kinship bonds of familial networks occur. On the other 
hand, organic solidarity arises out of interdependence from specialization of work 
and complementarities between people. This is a development occurring in &ldquo;mod-
ern&rdquo; and &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; societies. Organic solidarity is social cohesion grounded in a 
dependence individuals have upon one other in more advanced societies.
</p>
<p>For J.S.&nbsp;Mill and others, mutual assistance in business was the norm. Cooperation 
in the context of particular businesses was in elemental form a more generalized 
style of cooperation forming the heart of the division of labor, and hence, of the 
market (Mill 1848, at IV.7.21). Unlike Marxist accounts, Mill interpreted collabora-
tion, not class conflict, as essential to market operation.
</p>
<p>Mill favored economic democracy rather than capitalism as such. In advocating 
worker cooperatives over capitalist enterprise he states:
</p>
<p>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected 
in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and 
work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers them-
selves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their 
operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves (Id. at 
IV.1.7).
</p>
<p>From the standpoint of today&rsquo;s competitive global economy, Mill&rsquo;s observation is 
incisive: &ldquo;there is no more certain incident of the progressive change taking place in 
society, than the continual growth of principle and practice of cooperation&rdquo; (Ibid.).
</p>
<p>Although individuals may perform different tasks and possess different values 
and interests, the order and solidarity of society depends on their mutual reliance to 
carry out their respective tasks. As such, social solidarity is maintained in more 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>307
</p>
<p>complex societies through interdependence. Such solidarity is seen in contemporary 
business relationships such as supply chains.
</p>
<p>With globalization questions arise about what it spells in terms of solidarity. 
Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye characterize globalization as an increase in net-
works of interdependence obtaining between people across multi-continental 
divides (Keohane and Nye 2000, p.&nbsp;105). Their characterization emphasizes that 
globalization, far from being a one-dimensional type of connectedness, is taking 
place within intricate interdependent webs. Globalization occurs on multiple tiers: 
technological, environmental, economic (encompassing consumption, finance, 
investments, production, trade), cultural, social, legal, and political. Given so many 
patterns of interdependence, the challenge is to infuse these patterns with solidarity. 
One way this can come about is through growth of cultural capital.
</p>
<p> Cultural Capital
</p>
<p>The concept of cultural capital (Bourdieu 1986) refers to the reservoir of lively 
interrelations among people, along with mutual concern, shared understandings, 
common moral values, and trust. This intangible social asset solidifies affiliates of 
human communities and associations. It enables cooperative pursuits to materialize. 
Cultural capital lifts organizations and business communities up, making them more 
than a haphazard group of people each bent on advancing their respective private 
projects. The idea signifies the wherewithal required in running everyday dealings 
in public life. Those resources comprise beliefs, customs, habits, and morals. Such 
multifarious traditions, what Rousseau characterized as moeurs (Trachtenberg 
1993, p.&nbsp;231) we learn from our parents, and they make us suitable participants in 
the social and economic order.
</p>
<p>The way we interpret the mutual influences exerted between our common cul-
ture, the regulatory authority of government, and the businesses that operate in the 
economy shapes the way we comprehend the virtuous businessperson and the virtu-
ous company.
</p>
<p>Granted that businesses may have the ability to generate wealth, a question lin-
gers: for what purpose? Considering, in light of financial engineering advance-
ments, the momentous technical progress that can be achieved in constructing 
wealth, what remains unanswered is whether we are left any better than before. Of 
course, empirical data culled from balance sheets and revenue statements can indi-
cate that a firm has generated greater wealth than the previous quarter. And techno-
logical innovation might raise its levels of productivity. But KPIs (key performance 
indicators) will not provide any indication of whether our character is improved, or 
whether we are in a state of overall well-being. The intricate issue of to what extent 
our creative drive guides us toward authentic human betterment cannot be com-
pletely comprehended from the perspective of a market devoid of moral-cultural 
capital. On its own, such a market gives no signals as to whether we are approaching 
greater alignment with our human nature. Considered apart from cultural capital, 
the economic system itself does not provide criteria for making judgments 
</p>
<p>15 Economy of&nbsp;Mutuality: Equipping the&nbsp;Executive Mindset for&nbsp;Sustainable Business</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>308
</p>
<p>distinguishing between higher modes of human satisfaction, based on authentic 
needs, and lower modes that chase after fake needs and cripple our opportunities for 
genuine human fulfillment.
</p>
<p>Economy of mutuality presupposes devotion to moral virtues developed within a 
culture having the ability to ripen the excellence of the whole person. Considered by 
themselves, neither market nor government can accomplish this. Economy of mutu-
ality reminds us that technical business competence and informed government poli-
cies, while imperative, cannot of themselves assemble a good company or a good 
businessperson.
</p>
<p>Culture inculcates a way of viewing the world, of perceiving what is real, of 
bringing sense to reality. Culture illuminates what we hold sacred, guiding us to 
apprehend the deepest meaning extending back to our origins and ahead to the 
future.
</p>
<p>Human society is built upon a bedrck of cultural institutions. Family and educa-
tion are two of the foremost institutions vital for economic society. Family com-
prises the primary component of human culture; it is the basic unit of society. 
Education cultivates an awareness of and sensitivity toward the world, inspiring a 
sense of wonder, firing the imagination, and granting moral vision necessary to 
enlighten scientific, technical and commercial undertakings.
</p>
<p>Philosophy, along with religion, the arts, music, literature and other humanities 
are at the center of culture. These endeavors are concerned with what is most pre-
cious and noble in our lives. These wellsprings of higher culture prompt us to engage 
the deeper significance of our world, pointing beyond drab concerns of everyday 
things to what is enduring, directing us toward ultimate questions concerning our 
nature, our purpose and our destiny.
</p>
<p>The reason for this stems from a dynamic understood from antiquity: by drawing 
us back to our purpose, to our authentic nature, to our destiny, higher forms of cul-
ture equip us to perceive the whole, not simply the fragments. Culture equips us to 
assimilate the totality of the cosmos and guides us to comprehend how we fit into it. 
We grasp the wholeness by being united with elemental cycles of our existence such 
as living, growing, dying, loving, and working so as to relate them in an organic 
unity instead of in a subdivided way. Hidden at the center of all cultures deserving 
of the name is a yen to reunite what is detached.
</p>
<p>The gulf separating work and virtue engenders a kind of nihilism throughout 
much of today&rsquo;s business world&nbsp;&ndash; crossing all peoples and cultures.
</p>
<p>Perhaps what is needed is a way of connecting one&rsquo;s vocation in business to an 
ethical outlook on commercial life. This would involve linking:
</p>
<p>&bull; Business life to communities of virtue;
&bull; Generation of goods and services to the end of human flourishing;
&bull; Commercial enterprise to the common good;
&bull; Employment to the cultivation of excellence and pursuit of well-being in 
</p>
<p>employees.
</p>
<p>K. T. Jackson</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>309
</p>
<p>Straightforward talk about the ways cultural capital inspires and develops virtu-
ous businesspeople can stimulate meaningful discourse across cultures. This may 
engender some harmony among them. A heightened rapprochement between moral-
ity and business may promote more profound interactions among cultures, equip-
ping them to negotiate thorny ideological divergences. Yet it is not plausible to 
believe that we impart moral wisdom to one another if we simply follow govern-
ment laws and regulations or mimic technical financial methodologies. In truth, the 
profit-driven mindset, collective laws and conventional practices, and the economet-
ric worldview are too constraining for the art of business to flourish.
</p>
<p>The notion of cultural capital provides a means of explanation for why the profit 
motive is best interpreted as something broader than a relentless quest for profit 
maximization. Most of what is needed to create profit is attainable only through the 
cultivation and deployment of cultural capital. And although this type of intangible 
capital is not amenable to being reduced to a specific item on the balance sheet, 
nevertheless it contains value as a path to enhancing the bottom line.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the idea of cultural capital should be brought within the orbit of eco-
nomic thinking. As with financial capital, a business can build up reserves of cultural 
capital. It can accumulate this asset by helping to establish relationships of account-
ability, commitment, fair-dealing, goodwill, mutual respect, and trust, and in the pro-
cess, helping people to direct their respective talents toward a shared venture. It is a 
facilitator of human and social capital (Harrison 2013, p.&nbsp;2). Likewise, a business can 
draw upon cultural capital just as it can draw upon these other forms. Yet accomplish-
ing this may require adopting non-traditional styles of leadership and management 
aimed at a sapiential harnessing of intrinsically valuable human goods.
</p>
<p>People are most apt to flourish in the sort of surroundings in which overall social 
progress and cultural advancement are taking place. Economic growth comes about 
as a cooperative&mdash;not simply an individual&mdash;enterprise. The ability of sizeable 
groups to operate in conjunction with one another generates social trust, one of the 
essential components of market activity. Francis Fukuyama states that &ldquo;[t]rust is the 
expectation that arises within a community of regular, honest, and cooperative 
behavior, based on commonly shared norms &hellip;&rdquo; (Fukuyama 1995, p.&nbsp;26). &ldquo;These 
norms,&rdquo; he notes, &ldquo;can be about deep &lsquo;value&rsquo; questions like the nature of God or 
justice, but they also encompass secular norms like professional standards and 
codes of behavior&rdquo; (Ibid.).
</p>
<p> Homo Reciprocans
</p>
<p>One finds in a variety of economic theories the ideological construct homo eco-
nomicus. Here the human person is reduced to an egoistic actor seeking to satisfy 
his or her subjective ends. Making rational assessments, homo economicus sets foot 
in the market to maximize utility qua consumer and economic profit qua producer. 
</p>

<p/>

</p>
<p>Hence homo economicus, emblematic of market economy, starkly contrasts with the 
notion of homo reciprocans that portrays the human person embedded in social 
economy, having behavioral inclinations for reciprocity and cooperation with others 
(Dohmen et&nbsp; al. 2009). Real people do not necessarily pursue only exchanges of 
equivalent value; their actions sometimes spring from gratuitousness; their 
exchanges can be prolonged over time (Grassl 2011, p.&nbsp;114; Becchetti et&nbsp;al. 2008).
</p>
<p>The conceptual model relied upon to portray market economy, embraced by 
much of the business world, largely overlooks the fundamental complexity of 
human nature at the core of economics and business (Freeman and Newkirk 2008, 
pp.&nbsp; 139&ndash;143). In fact, reciprocal human behavior is harmonious with markets. 
Historical evidence shows that reciprocity promotes markets and is conversely but-
tressed by market economies (Grassl 2011, p.&nbsp;114).
</p>
<p> Common Good
</p>
<p>Economy of mutuality stresses the purposive nature of business enterprise. As such 
it is in line with both the methodological approach taken by Aristotle&nbsp;&ndash; inquiring 
into the purposive character of all human enterprises (Solomon 2004, p.&nbsp;1023)&nbsp;&ndash; as 
well as with approaches examining the broader purpose of business (Calvez and 
Naughton 2002; Sison and Fontrodona 2011).
</p>
<p>The notion of &ldquo;common good&rdquo; is especially germane, denoting something more than the 
competing interests of selfish individuals and beyond composite interests of special groups. 
It is the good we all have in common&nbsp;&ndash; communal conditions necessary for virtuous pursuit 
of human fulfillment, flourishing, and perfection by all in society. The common good is an 
aggregation of collaborative initiatives and shared restraints by which society helps every-
one achieve what in the end only each individual can accomplish for herself: shaping a good 
will and constituting an authentically human self by freely choosing good every time one is 
given the chance and responsibility to do so.
</p>
<p>Thus understood, the common good looks in two directions: to the good of society and 
to the good of the individuals, since social conditions supply part of the means for human 
fulfillment. Yet ultimately the two directions are not at odds with one another. Instead they 
are correlational since &ldquo;any good of an individual that is a real good is rooted in the good of 
the community, and, conversely, any common good that is a real good is at the same time 
the good of all individuals who share in that community&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Brien 2009, p.&nbsp;29).
</p>
<p>At its best, business builds up the common good of society (Solomon 2004; Mel&eacute; 
2009; O&rsquo;Brien 2009; Sison and Fontrodona 2011). Moreover, the institution of busi-
ness can be depicted from the standpoint of its own peculiar common good (Sison 
2007; Mel&eacute; 2009). Taken together these propositions mean that business advances 
the common good of society when it sets about fulfilling the common good of its 
own (Sison and Fontrodona 2011).

</p>
<p>To this point, in the eyes of many classical economists, instead of contravening 
civil society, the market embodies it. Proper functioning of the market depends on 
contracts, cooperation, institutions and trust. These elements promote reciprocity. 
Throughout the classical Latin tradition, economic activity provides a setting where 
humans manifest their social being, revealing a thirst for camaraderie in relation-
ships of equality and dignity.
</p>
<p>For those who see the market as a den of vicious selfish competition, character-
ized by excessive gain-seeking behavior of business firms, such characterizations 
appear strange. But a crucial insight that economy of mutuality offers is this: the 
market reveals itself as a manifestation of social life the moment we discern beneath 
it a shared sense of common good. This is something logically prior to bargaining.
</p>
<p>By building good and just institutions, by forming agreements grounded in 
authentic trust rather than on the basis of deceptive and disingenuous corporate 
images, market interactions will take on a wider and more virtuous role. From this 
vantage point, the economy of mutuality acquires nourishment from a tradition of 
thought common in ancient economies.
</p>
<p> Virtue
</p>
<p>There is a moral disconnectedness both within business and within wider culture. 
This decoupling arises from a self-understanding of business that has unwittingly 
abandoned the moral virtues in relation to economic life, together with their broader 
cultural underpinnings. Consequently, it is urgent to consider what is meant by 
being &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;successful&rdquo; in business, and to clarify the virtues required for 
being a good businessperson.
</p>
<p>Our inquiry is aided by reflecting on cultural capital&nbsp; &ndash; the intangible moral 
resource needed to develop the virtues for achieving excellence in business, what-
ever one&rsquo;s station. The virtuous businessperson is not only a self-project of indi-
vidual motivation and effort. Cultivating virtue ultimately depends upon culture&nbsp;&ndash; its 
institutions of family, education, and the arts&nbsp;&ndash; to provide formation that fosters 
excellence.
</p>
<p> The Place for&nbsp;Profitability
</p>
<p>Considering business as a human enterprise (Freeman and Newkirk 2008), one finds 
that deep down, people work to gain a better, fulfilled life for themselves, for loved 
ones, for the community in which they live. For this betterment to happen, it is vital 
that individuals working in a free market economy have opportunities to willingly 
invest whatever talent, vigor, and know-how they possess.

</p>
<p>From this dynamic of freely investing themselves, a free people is guided, in 
Adam Smith&rsquo;s imagery, by an invisible hand toward prosperity and well-being. In 
this way, we expect that wealth will be created, not just in the short term but in a 
sustainable fashion. Adam Smith&rsquo;s invisible hand need not be taken to convey any-
thing mysterious. Common sense suggests that by letting people go after their self- 
interest, unintended yet favorable social outcomes will ensue. In the course of 
seeking profit, people unwittingly contribute beneficial effects: increasing the over-
all wealth of society, facilitating technological innovation, fostering peace and civil-
ity, enabling workers to get more and improved jobs, bringing people of different 
lands together to know and respect one another.
</p>
<p>Of course, not all motivations underpinning markets are purely self-interested. 
Nor is the invisible hand a completely reliable check on individual rapacity. Beyond 
pointing out the importance of pursuing self-interest, Adam Smith stresses the vir-
tues of benevolence and sympathy. (Smith 1759/1976). For Smith, self-interest 
expressed within the rules of a commercial society is not opposed to virtue. Indeed, 
character traits associated with the pursuit of long-term self-interest&nbsp;&ndash; prudence, tem-
perance, and self-command&nbsp;&ndash; are key business virtues (Hirschman 1997, pp.&nbsp;18&ndash;19).
</p>
<p>Contemporary market economy represents one component of ideal commercial 
society. Additional elements are private property, free exchange, democracy and 
rule of law. Taken together, these components help fuel individual initiative, engag-
ing creative capacities across the population to give those potentials a chance to 
ignite, express themselves, and lead to contentment and well-being.
</p>
<p>Yet the profit motive is seen in wider culture as the end-all-and-be-all of business. 
Relentless pursuit of profit is praised: &ldquo;the honor is in the dollar.&rdquo; But the concept of 
&ldquo;profit motive&rdquo; is distorted by narrow economic models. The mindset that sees mar-
kets as fueled entirely by self-interest, taking self-interest as the single- minded hunt 
for profit, misunderstands both &ldquo;self-interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;profit maximization.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Self-Interest in&nbsp;Proper Proportion
</p>
<p>Tocqueville observed, in the American context, an attitude of rational self-interest 
properly understood: each person identifies their own self-interest with that of all in 
the society.
</p>
<p>When rightly understood, self-interest elevates people above narrow selfish pre-
occupations. Although self-interest might not instantaneously manufacture virtue, it 
wields a discipline that &ldquo;shapes a lot of orderly, temperate, moderate, careful, and 
self-controlled citizens&rdquo; (Tocqueville 1863/1994, p.&nbsp;527). From Tocqueville&rsquo;s van-
tage point, a person&rsquo;s rational concern for self gets joined to a broader sense of 
esteem for various cultural, moral, and legal establishments enabling the wider 
population to follow their freely selected ambitions, principally through business 
enterprise.
</p>
<p>A virtuous company is a far cry from a mere &ldquo;profit machine.&rdquo; Writing about 
visionary companies, Collins and Porras state that
</p>
<p>K. T. Jackson</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>313
</p>
<p>Profitability is a necessary condition for existence and a means to more important ends, but 
it is not the end in itself for many of the visionary companies. Profit is like oxygen, food, 
water, and blood for the body; they are not the point of life, but without them, there is no 
life (Collins and Porras 1994, p.&nbsp;55).
</p>
<p>Such companies embrace a &ldquo;core ideology,&rdquo; or &ldquo;vital shaping force&rdquo; which might 
stem from its origins, as in the case of Sony; or, as with Merck, from a successive 
generation; or even remain quiescent to be revivified at some subsequent point, as 
occurred with Ford (Id. p.&nbsp;54). A virtuous firm might have as its principal motiva-
tions professionalism, civic responsibility and customer service, like Housing 
Development Finance Corporation.3 Its driving force could be &ldquo;bedrock values&rdquo; of 
personal accountability, respect for the individual, truth, and fair dealing, like Sealed 
Air Corporation.4 It may be spurred on by a commitment to integrity, fairness, fun, 
and social responsibility, as AES Corporation is.5
</p>
<p>As with a human being, the organization must have an authentic commitment to 
its objectives, in a way that is true to its own character and internal nature as a moral 
agent that is free to choose. It cannot simply mimic the values of other firms, con-
form to external diktats, or smartly calculate which roster of values will prove to be 
the most lucrative, trendy or well-liked (Collins and Porras 1994, p.&nbsp;75).
</p>
<p>No matter how a company articulates its mission, profit maximization normally 
is not listed as its objectives. Instead, profit is a predictable and reliable side-effect 
arising in an indirect fashion from the company seeking other aspirations. To situate 
this thought within the real world of business, we can turn to the results of Collins 
and Porras&rsquo; extensive study of companies noted for attaining exceptional long-term 
performance. Among their findings, the authors note a shattering of the myth that 
the companies achieving the highest degree of success owe their existence princi-
pally to the quest for profit maximization:
</p>
<p>Contrary to business school doctrine, &ldquo;maximizing shareholder wealth&rdquo; or &ldquo;profit maximi-
zation&rdquo; has not been the dominant driving force or primary objective through the history of 
the visionary companies. Visionary companies pursue a cluster of objectives, of which mak-
ing money is only one&nbsp;&ndash; and not necessarily the primary one. Yes, they seek profits, but 
they&rsquo;re equally guided by a core ideology&nbsp;&ndash; core values and sense of purpose beyond just 
making money. Yet, paradoxically, the visionary companies make more money than the 
more purely profit-driven comparison companies&rdquo; (Collins and Porras 1994, p.&nbsp;8).
</p>
<p>Narrowing in on profit alone makes an enterprise lose sight of its authentic mis-
sion. Conversely, if a firm remains guided by its true objective, profit is produced in 
due course.

</p>
<p>Collins and Porras demonstrate how companies that elevate profit to the apex of 
their business plan, considering everything else as subordinate to it and deeming 
this to be the principal means by which to beat the competition, forfeit the competi-
tive advantage they were pursuing. Rather than &ldquo;beating the competition,&rdquo; visionary 
companies,
</p>
<p>focus primarily on beating themselves. Success and beating competitors comes to the 
visionary companies not so much as the end goal, but as a residual result of relentlessly 
asking the question &ldquo;How can we improve ourselves to do better tomorrow than we did 
today?&rdquo; And they have asked this question day in and day out&nbsp;&ndash; as a disciplined way of 
life&nbsp;&ndash; in some cases for over 150&nbsp;years. No matter how much they achieve&nbsp;&ndash; no matter how 
far in front of their competitors they pull&nbsp;&ndash; they never think they&rsquo;ve done &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; 
(Collins and Porras 1994, p.&nbsp;10).
</p>
<p>The upshot is that the invisible hand is more flexible, having a wider range of 
motion than normally thought. The invisible hand guides in not one but two direc-
tions: social good gets generated as a consequence of businesses&rsquo; quest for profit; as 
well, businesses&rsquo; quest for social good generates profit. Economic and moral values, 
along with financial and social values, are not necessarily at odds with one another 
but instead complementary, in the way oppositions of &ldquo;yin&rdquo; and &ldquo;yang&rdquo; function as 
harmonizing forces of holistic Eastern philosophy (Jackson 2004, p.&nbsp;46).
</p>
<p> Conclusion
</p>
<p>This chapter shows how economy of mutuality can help us comprehend the blurring 
of boundaries sometimes seen between &ldquo;normal&rdquo; businesses (market economy) and 
non-for profit or social businesses.
</p>
<p>The proximate ends of for-profit, hybrid, and nonprofit businesses respectively 
was identified at the level of business and economic theories.
</p>
<p>Higher ends of these various archetypes were then spotlighted, and an account of 
an ultimate end-state across archetypes was articulated at a deep and broad level. 
With the help of five concepts&nbsp;&ndash; social solidarity and interdependence, cultural capi-
tal, homo reciprocans, common good, and virtue&nbsp;&ndash; it was explained why the ulti-
mate end-state is reciprocity and integral human development.
</p>
<p>Among the implications raised by economy of mutuality are a reappraisal of 
boundaries between sectors, along with an appropriate endorsement of new forms 
of business enterprises. According to this interpretive framework there is no reason 
to privilege either for-profit enterprise or non-profit enterprise, by crediting either of 
them with carrying out a more important task or imparting higher moral value. The 
shift is toward the objective of infusing all archetypes of business enterprise with 
&ldquo;pro-social&rdquo; attitudes.
</p>
<p>K. T. Jackson</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>315
</p>
<p>Another implication of economy of mutuality is a call to update outmoded 
approaches to executive leadership entrenched in narrow mindsets threatening to 
decouple business from its nobler purposes.
</p>
<p>Overall, the chapter shows how the mode of organization represented by various 
archetypes of business enterprise is secondary to the higher purpose of a business. 
The analysis advocates comprehensive moral thinking, inviting business leaders to 
look at their roles not solely in insular economic terms, but in pro-social terms. 
From the standpoint of economy of mutuality, while it is acknowledged that  
for- profit business enterprises have shareholder and stakeholders, they have as  
well vocations to engage in realistic ways with other institutions in building  
a better, more sustainable world by fostering reciprocity and authentic  
human development.

<p>Part IV
</p>
<p>Introduction: Strategic Differentiation&nbsp;&ndash; 
Creating Competitive Advantage
</p>
<p>Gilbert&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Lenssen 
</p>
<p>According to Michael Porter and Mark Kramer, there are three pathways to creating 
</p>
<p>shared value; i.e., developing sustainable value propositions to stakeholders for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of gaining competitive advantage:
</p>
<p> 1. Reconceiving products and services to better meet social and environmental 
</p>
<p>needs in a profitable way;
</p>
<p> 2. Redefining productivity in the value chain to generate more efficient and more 
</p>
<p>sustainable use of human and material resources, both in the supply and distribu-
</p>
<p>tion chain;
</p>
<p> 3. Local cluster development among producers and suppliers and also between 
</p>
<p>profit and non-profit sectors, including NGOs, who can become partners in the 
</p>
<p>business model instead of adversaries.
</p>
<p>This reflects the core idea of Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s Creating Shared Value (CSV): 
</p>
<p>that business can create economic value AND value for society in mutually benefi-
</p>
<p>cial ways. This can create competitive advantage for the business and, as a result, 
</p>
<p>the value for stakeholders and society is more sustainable because it is underpinned 
</p>
<p>by economic incentives. A growing number of companies (Nestle, Coca-Cola, 
</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, Umicore, Illy Caf&eacute;, General Electric, Unilever, GSK and oth-
</p>
<p>ers) have already embraced the shared value concept.
</p>
<p>However, while stakeholder pressure can force companies to become more sus-
</p>
<p>tainable, it does not necessarily follow that competitors in the sector will follow. An 
</p>
<p>example is Hydro Polymers Limited, a division of Norsk Hydro ASA (Hydro 
</p>
<p>Polymers later became INEOS ChlorVinyls), which dramatically changed its strat-
</p>
<p>egy to become a more sustainable producer of PVC.&nbsp;Some investments in sustain-
</p>
<p>ability paid back handsomely, but overall the European PVC producers were was 
</p>
<p>left at a considerable cost disadvantage relative to cheap Chinese imports, in part 
</p>
<p>due to the costs associated with sustainability improvements.
</p>
<p>A deliberate strategy ahead of NGO pressures has to consider first mover disad-
</p>
<p>vantages and make sure that upfront investments can be remunerated over the </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>318
</p>
<p>medium term. There are no guarantees, especially when sustainability driven strate-
</p>
<p>gies can be subject to uncertain regulatory conditions.
</p>
<p>Key Questions to Ask (Applicable to All Part IV Cases)
</p>
<p>How can a sustainability-related value proposition enhance strategic advantage?
</p>
<p>How is this achieved: by new innovative products and services, redefining produc-
</p>
<p>tivity in the value chain, partnerships and clusters?
</p>
<p>How can business models lower disadvantaged exposure to macro trends?
</p>
<p>How can differentiation be achieved? Can it be sustained?
</p>
<p>How is this strategy informed by first mover advantage/ disadvantage analysis?
</p>
<p>Is the strategy backed up with critical resources such as preferential external rela-
</p>
<p>tionships with stakeholders, internal organisational capabilities, knowledge man-
</p>
<p>agement processes and systems?
</p>
<p>Are these resources unique or difficult to imitate by competitors?
</p>
<p>Which normative framework needs to support the sustainability business 
</p>
<p>proposition?
</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Creating Shared Value by Michael E.&nbsp;Porter and Mark R.&nbsp;Kramer
</p>
<p>We include this popular article from the Harvard Business Review on the concept of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;shared value&rdquo;. The concept is not new, but the article is crafted with the language 
</p>
<p>of industry competitiveness for which Porter gained fame. Porter differentiates his 
</p>
<p>concept clearly from philanthropy, which he earlier theorised and advocated as a 
</p>
<p>way for business to discharge social responsibilities (as a way of &ldquo;giving back&rdquo; to 
</p>
<p>enhance legitimacy) during the second (E)ABIS colloquium in 2003&nbsp;in Copenhagen. 
</p>
<p>The response from the audience was so unfavourable that perhaps it contributed to 
</p>
<p>his later writing where he articulates a much deeper sense of social responsibility. In 
</p>
<p>2006, he published with Mark Kramer &ldquo;Strategy and Society: The Links Between 
</p>
<p>Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility&rdquo; in the Harvard 
</p>
<p>Business Review in which he distances himself from the views expressed in his 2003 
</p>
<p>lecture. But he also distances himself from CSR in the later paper which we publish 
</p>
<p>here and claims that his concept of shared value is about a new capitalist way of 
</p>
<p>creating sustainable value in a strategic way, whilst CSR is more about tactical 
</p>
<p>responses to pressures for social responsibility from NGO activists.
</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Response to Porter: Responsibility for Realising the Promise of 
</p>
<p>Shared Value by Gast&oacute;n de los Reyes, Jr. and Markus Scholz
</p>
<p>Porter may have been applauded by the corporate world for his pro-market, pro- 
</p>
<p>business stance, his emphasis on the role of business in creating value, and for coin-
</p>
<p>ing the term shared value, which speaks clearly to managers. However, in academic 
</p>
<p>circles, he was heavily criticised. His apparent departure from a normative ethical 
</p>
<p>stance at the outset created much antagonism. To an outsider to the community of 
</p>
<p>CSR scholars, this critique might at first have appeared to be driven by envy of 
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>319
</p>
<p>Porter&rsquo;s success, but it became well substantiated as further research emerged. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, a purely instrumental strategy of shared value might backfire with stake-
</p>
<p>holders viewing it as insincere or even cynical. As is demonstrated in Chap. 22, a 
</p>
<p>laudable CSV inspired business initiative like micro finance needs a normative 
</p>
<p>framework for managers to keep the business model credible and sustainable. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, there are sometimes negative impacts of business that can only be reme-
</p>
<p>diated at the cost of business since there is no shared value to be gained (though 
</p>
<p>action can potentially protect against loss of value from issues driven campaigns 
</p>
<p>and subsequent loss of legitimacy and trust). Often, this can only be achieved by 
</p>
<p>industry sector wide action, inspired by normative concerns.
</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Illycaf&egrave;: Value Creation Through Sustainable Supplier 
</p>
<p>Relationships by Francesco Perrini and Angeloantonio Russo
</p>
<p>This case is an excellent example of creating shared value through redefining pro-
</p>
<p>ductivity in the value chain, while also including due attention to the normative ethi-
</p>
<p>cal motivations of Illy&rsquo;s management. The Fair Trade initiative asks consumers to 
</p>
<p>pay a fair price for coffee to remunerate the work of the farmers in a decent way. 
</p>
<p>Porter portrays this as a CSR initiative which is not at the heart of the business 
</p>
<p>model of the coffee industry and therefore likely to remain an ethical niche trade. 
</p>
<p>Illy started from a different motivation. The company succeeded in securing quality 
</p>
<p>of coffee in the face of a crisis in the global coffee market by creating direct partner-
</p>
<p>ships with coffee farmers, training and supporting them, and paying a higher price 
</p>
<p>for higher quality. The shared value between the company and the farmers is embed-
</p>
<p>ded in the transformed business model and is more stable and sustainable. Andrea 
</p>
<p>Illy, the family firm&rsquo;s CEO, believes passionately in caring for &ldquo;his&rdquo; farmers as part 
</p>
<p>of a successful business and, to this day, Illy does not seek publicity for &ldquo;doing 
</p>
<p>good&rdquo;. It just claims to make the best coffee in the world.
</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Microfinance as a Shakespearean Tragedy: The Creation of 
</p>
<p>Shared Value, While Acting Responsibly by Harry Hummels
</p>
<p>Microfinance&mdash;providing financial products to poor entrepreneurs&mdash;was hailed as 
</p>
<p>the panacea for unlocking business potential at the &ldquo;bottom of the pyramid&rdquo; in 
</p>
<p>emerging and developing societies for potentially more than 100 million entrepre-
</p>
<p>neurs. Microfinance is a classic illustration of creating shared value: by attracting 
</p>
<p>capital from around the world (not in the least from big institutional investors) with 
</p>
<p>above average returns and risks spread widely over many lenders, and providing 
</p>
<p>much-needed finance to poor entrepreneurs with great potential to their enhance 
</p>
<p>business opportunities, business acumen and business skills. Microfinance prom-
</p>
<p>ised to make dreams come true the world over, but it became a victim of its own 
</p>
<p>success. By attracting massive capital inflows, the unethical practices of loan offi-
</p>
<p>cers and debt collectors proved to be fatal to the business. Sudden external changes 
</p>
<p>in the social environment did the rest. The case focuses on the microfinance busi-
</p>
<p>ness of Actiam, a Dutch asset manager and how it sailed through the ensuing crisis.

<p>Chapter 20: &ldquo;Ecomagination&rdquo; at Work: GE&rsquo;s Sustainability Initiative by 
</p>
<p>S.&nbsp;George and S.&nbsp;Regani
</p>
<p>This case is a good example of a company creating shared value by improving 
</p>
<p>energy efficiency in its own operations and by reconceiving products and services 
</p>
<p>to better meet social and environmental needs in a profitable way. Lately GE has 
</p>
<p>also been creating partnerships for sustainable development solutions. Ecomagination 
</p>
<p>was conceived as a business strategy for GE&rsquo;s B2B customers to use innovative and 
</p>
<p>intelligent resource efficiency solutions to help them grow and compete in a sustain-
</p>
<p>able way. Innovation, partnerships, new business models and engaging stakeholders 
</p>
<p>all form part of the strategy. In 2015, GE formed the Ecomagination 2020 
</p>
<p>Partnerships for Sustainability and Innovation, with large companies like Walmart, 
</p>
<p>Total, Intel, Statoil, Masdar, MWH Global and Goldman Sachs, to address global 
</p>
<p>resource challenges. Collaborative partnerships have been created in energy effi-
</p>
<p>ciency, water reuse, energy neutral wastewater, and new hybrid renewable solutions. 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Current, Powered by GE&rsquo; is a new start-up which focuses on combining innovative 
</p>
<p>technology solutions for sustainability with digital and financial capabilities. In 
</p>
<p>2015 alone, GE invested $2.3 billion in clean technology R&amp;D and generated $36 
</p>
<p>billion in revenues from its Ecomagination business.

<p>Chapter 21: Sustainability as Opportunity: Unilever&rsquo;s Sustainable Living 
</p>
<p>Plan by Joanne Lawrence, Andreas Rasche and Kevina Kenny
</p>
<p>Shareholder value has been the prevailing orthodoxy in business since the eighties. 
</p>
<p>The focus on delivering short-term shareholder value has led, says Paul Polman, 
</p>
<p>CEO of Unilever in an interview in Management Today in 2011, &ldquo;to widespread 
</p>
<p>addiction to quick artificial highs&nbsp;&ndash; rather like a junkie hooked on heroin or a finan-
</p>
<p>cial trader on cocaine&rdquo;. The ultimate cost of short-termism, he says, was the finan-
</p>
<p>cial crisis of 2008&ndash;2009. He elaborates: &ldquo;Too many investors have become 
</p>
<p>short-term gamblers: the more fluctuations in share price they can engineer, the 
</p>
<p>better it is for them. It is not good for the companies or for society, nor for long term 
</p>
<p>shareholders, but it is influencing the way firms are being run, all the same. To drag 
</p>
<p>the world back to sanity, we need to know why we are here. The answer is: for con-
</p>
<p>sumers, not short term investors. If we are in synch with consumer needs and the 
</p>
<p>environment in which we operate, and take responsibility for society as well as for 
</p>
<p>our employees, then the shareholder will also be rewarded.&rdquo; Clearly the CEO of 
</p>
<p>Unilever is a man with a mission and a strong belief in shared value. When Polman 
</p>
<p>announced his Sustainable Living Plan (SLP) strategy in 2010 and his intention to 
</p>
<p>abandon quarterly earnings forecasts, Unilever&rsquo;s shares dropped 10&nbsp;% at a stroke. At 
</p>
<p>Davos in 2011, he announced that he would no longer make financial presentations

</p>
<p>to hedge fund managers. &ldquo;I do not wish to be political, but my decisions are made 
</p>
<p>in the long-term interests of the company,&rdquo; he said. It seems he was rather happy that 
</p>
<p>the hedge fund investors left.
</p>
<p>The essence of the SLP strategy is to decouple growth from environmental 
</p>
<p>impact in the areas of greenhouse gases, water use, waste and packaging, and sus-
</p>
<p>tainable sourcing. Unilever wants to double its sales by 2020, but halve its effects on 
</p>
<p>the environment. Meanwhile, social objectives have been added to the plan in the 
</p>
<p>areas of health, well being and nutrition, and in relation to fairness in the workplace, 
</p>
<p>opportunities for women, and &ldquo;inclusive business&rdquo;. All areas have detailed perfor-
</p>
<p>mance targets. Regular reporting on these targets is provided in the Annual Report 
</p>
<p>(e.g., 2015 report) as well as in the online Sustainable Living Report (e.g. May 2016 
</p>
<p>report). These reports are verified by independent external auditors.

<p>16Creating Shared Value
How to Reinvent Capitalism&mdash;And Unleash a Wave of 
Innovation and Growth
</p>
<p>Michael&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Porter and&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Kramer
</p>
<p>THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM is under siege. In recent years business increas-
</p>
<p>ingly has been viewed as a major cause of social, environmental, and economic 
</p>
<p>problems. Companies are widely perceived to be prospering at the expense of the 
</p>
<p>broader community.
</p>
<p>Even worse, the more business has begun to embrace corporate responsibility, 
</p>
<p>the more it has been blamed for society&rsquo;s failures. The legitimacy of business has 
</p>
<p>fallen to levels not seen in recent history. This diminished trust in business leads 
</p>
<p>political leaders to set policies that undermine competitiveness and sap economic 
</p>
<p>growth. Business is caught in a vicious circle.
</p>
<p>A big part of the problem lies with companies themselves, which remain trapped 
</p>
<p>in an outdated approach to value creation that has emerged over the past few 
</p>
<p>decades. They continue to view value creation narrowly, optimizing short-term 
</p>
<p>financial performance in a bubble while missing the most important customer needs 
</p>
<p>Capitalism is under siege....Diminished to set policies that sap economic growth&hellip;. The purpose of 
the corporation must be trust in business is causing political leaders Business is caught in a vicious 
circle.... redefined around</p>

</p>
<p>and ignoring the broader influences that determine their longer-term success. How 
</p>
<p>else could companies overlook the well being of their customers, the depletion of 
</p>
<p>natural resources vital to their businesses, the viability of key suppliers, or the eco-
</p>
<p>nomic distress of the communities in which they produce and sell? How else could 
</p>
<p>companies think that simply shifting activities to locations with ever lower wages 
</p>
<p>was a sustainable &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to competitive challenges? Government and civil soci-
</p>
<p>ety have often exacerbated the problem by attempting to address social weaknesses 
</p>
<p>at the expense of business. The presumed trade-offs between economic efficiency 
</p>
<p>and social progress have been institutionalized in decades of policy choices.
</p>
<p>Companies must take the lead in bringing business and society back together. 
</p>
<p>The recognition is there among sophisticated business and thought leaders, and 
</p>
<p>promising elements of a new model are emerging. Yet we still lack an overall frame-
</p>
<p>work for guiding these efforts, and most companies remain stuck in a &ldquo;social 
</p>
<p>responsibility&rdquo; mind-set in which societal issues are at the periphery, not the core.
</p>
<p>The solution lies in the principle of shared value, which involves creating eco-
</p>
<p>nomic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and 
</p>
<p>challenges. Businesses must reconnect company success with social progress. 
</p>
<p>Shared value is not social responsibility, philanthropy, or even sustainability, but a 
</p>
<p>new way to achieve economic success. It is not on the margin of what companies do 
</p>
<p>but at the center. We believe that it can give rise to the next major transformation of 
</p>
<p>business thinking.
</p>
<p>A growing number of companies known for their hard-nosed approach to busi-
</p>
<p>ness&mdash;such as GE, Google, IBM, Intel, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nestl&eacute;, Unilever, and 
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart&mdash;have already embarked on important efforts to create shared value by 
</p>
<p>reconceiving the intersection between society and corporate performance. Yet our 
</p>
<p>recognition of the transformative power of shared value is still in its genesis. 
</p>
<p>Realizing it will require leaders and managers to develop new skills and knowl-
</p>
<p>edge&mdash;such as a far deeper appreciation of societal needs, a greater understanding 
</p>
<p>of the true bases of company productivity, and the ability to collaborate across 
</p>
<p>profit/nonprofit boundaries. And government must learn how to regulate in ways 
</p>
<p>that enable shared value rather than work against it.
</p>
<p>Capitalism is an unparalleled vehicle for meeting human needs, improving effi-
</p>
<p>ciency, creating jobs, and building wealth. But a narrow conception of capitalism 
</p>
<p>has prevented business from harnessing its full potential to meet society&rsquo;s broader 
</p>
<p>challenges. The opportunities have been there all along but have been overlooked. 
</p>
<p>Businesses acting as businesses, not as charitable donors, are the most powerful 
</p>
<p>force for addressing the pressing issues we face. The moment for a new conception 
</p>
<p>of capitalism is now; society&rsquo;s needs are large and growing, while customers, 
</p>
<p>employees, and a new generation of young people are asking business to step up.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the corporation must be redefined as creating shared value, not 
</p>
<p>just profit per se. This will drive the next wave of innovation and productivity growth 
</p>
<p>in the global economy. It will also reshape capitalism and its relationship to society. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps most important of all, learning how to create shared value is our best chance 
</p>
<p>to legitimize business again.

</p>
<p> Moving Beyond Trade-Offs
</p>
<p>Business and society have been pitted against each other for too long. That is in part 
</p>
<p>because economists have legitimized the idea that to provide societal benefits, com-
</p>
<p>panies must temper their economic success. In neoclassical thinking, a requirement 
</p>
<p>for social improvement&mdash;such as safety or hiring the disabled&mdash;imposes a con-
</p>
<p>straint on the corporation. Adding a constraint to a firm that is already maximizing 
</p>
<p>profits, says the theory, will inevitably raise costs and reduce those profits.
</p>
<p>Societal needs, not just conventional economic needs, define markets, and social harms can 
create internal costs for firms.
</p>
<p>A related concept, with the same conclusion, is the notion of externalities. 
</p>
<p>Externalities arise when firms create social costs that they do not have to bear, such 
</p>
<p>as pollution. Thus, society must impose taxes, regulations, and penalties so that 
</p>
<p>firms &ldquo;internalize&rdquo; these externalities&mdash;a belief influencing many government pol-
</p>
<p>icy decisions.
</p>
<p>This perspective has also shaped the strategies of firms themselves, which have 
</p>
<p>largely excluded social and environmental considerations from their economic 
</p>
<p>thinking. Firms have taken the broader context in which they do business as a given 
</p>
<p>and resisted regulatory standards as invariably contrary to their interests. Solving 
</p>
<p>social problems has been ceded to governments and to NGOs. Corporate responsi-
</p>
<p>bility programs&mdash;a reaction to external pressure&mdash;have emerged largely to improve 
</p>
<p>firms&rsquo; reputations and are treated as a necessary expense. Anything more is seen by 
</p>
<p>Idea in Brief
</p>
<p>The concept of shared value&mdash;which focuses on the connections between 
</p>
<p>societal and economic progress&mdash;has the power to unleash the next wave of 
</p>
<p>global growth.
</p>
<p>An increasing number of companies known for their hard-nosed approach 
</p>
<p>to business&mdash;such as Google, IBM, Intel, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nestl&eacute;, 
</p>
<p>Unilever, and Wal-Mart&mdash;have begun to embark on important shared value 
</p>
<p>initiatives. But our understanding of the potential of shared value is just 
</p>
<p>beginning
</p>
<p>There are three key ways that companies can create shared value 
</p>
<p>opportunities:
</p>
<p>&bull; By reconceiving products and markets
</p>
<p>&bull; By redefining productivity in the value chain
</p>
<p>&bull; By enabling local cluster development
</p>
<p>Every firm should look at decisions and opportunities through the lens of 
</p>
<p>shared value. This will lead to new approaches that generate greater innova-
</p>
<p>tion and growth for companies&mdash;and also greater benefits for society.
</p>
<p>16 Creating Shared Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>326
</p>
<p>many as an irresponsible use of shareholders&rsquo; money. Governments, for their part, 
</p>
<p>have often regulated in a way that makes shared value more difficult to achieve. 
</p>
<p>Implicitly, each side has assumed that the other is an obstacle to pursuing its goals 
</p>
<p>and acted accordingly.
</p>
<p>The concept of shared value, in contrast, recognizes that societal needs, not just 
</p>
<p>conventional economic needs, define markets. It also recognizes that social harms 
</p>
<p>or weaknesses frequently create internal costs for firms&mdash;such as wasted energy or 
</p>
<p>raw materials, costly accidents, and the need for remedial training to compensate for 
</p>
<p>inadequacies in education. And addressing societal harms and constraints does not 
</p>
<p>necessarily raise costs for firms, because they can innovate through using new tech-
</p>
<p>nologies, operating methods, and management approaches&mdash;and as a result, increase 
</p>
<p>their productivity and expand their markets.
</p>
<p>Shared value, then, is not about personal values. Nor is it about &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; the 
</p>
<p>value already created by firms&mdash;a redistribution approach. Instead, it is about 
</p>
<p>expanding the total pool of economic and social value. A good example of this dif-
</p>
<p>ference in perspective is the fair trade movement in purchasing. Fair trade aims to 
</p>
<p>increase the proportion of revenue that goes to poor farmers by paying them higher 
</p>
<p>prices for the same crops. Though this may be a noble sentiment, fair trade is mostly 
</p>
<p>about redistribution rather than expanding the overall amount of value created. A 
</p>
<p>shared value perspective, instead, focuses on improving growing techniques and 
</p>
<p>strengthening the local cluster of supporting suppliers and other institutions in order 
</p>
<p>to increase farmers&rsquo; efficiency, yields, product quality, and sustainability. This leads 
</p>
<p>to a bigger pie of revenue and profits that benefits both farmers and the companies 
</p>
<p>that buy from them. Early studies of cocoa farmers in the C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, for instance, 
</p>
<p>suggest that while fair trade can increase farmers&rsquo; incomes by 10&ndash;20%, shared 
</p>
<p>value investments can raise their incomes by more than 300%. Initial investment 
</p>
<p>and time may be required to implement new procurement practices and develop the 
</p>
<p>supporting cluster, but the return will be greater economic value and broader strate-
</p>
<p>gic benefits for all participants.
</p>
<p> The Roots of&nbsp;Shared Value
</p>
<p>At a very basic level, the competitiveness of a company and the health of the communi-
</p>
<p>ties around it are closely intertwined. A business needs a successful community, not 
</p>
<p>only to create demand for its products but also to provide critical public assets and a 
</p>
<p>supportive environment. A community needs successful businesses to provide jobs and 
</p>
<p>wealth creation opportunities for its citizens. This interdependence means that public 
</p>
<p>policies that undermine the productivity and competitiveness of businesses are self-
</p>
<p>defeating, especially in a global economy where facilities and jobs can easily move 
</p>
<p>elsewhere. NGOs and governments have not always appreciated this connection.
</p>
<p>In the old, narrow view of capitalism, business contributes to society by making 
</p>
<p>a profit, which supports employment, wages, purchases, investments, and taxes. 
</p>
<p>Conducting business as usual is sufficient social benefit. A firm is largely a self-
</p>
<p>contained entity, and social or community issues fall outside its proper scope. (This 
</p>
<p>M. E. Porter and M. R. Kramer</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>327
</p>
<p>is the argument advanced persuasively by Milton Friedman in his critique of the 
</p>
<p>whole notion of corporate social responsibility.)
</p>
<p> What Is &ldquo;Shared Value&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>The concept of shared value can be defined as policies and operating practices that 
</p>
<p>enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the eco-
</p>
<p>nomic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates. Shared value 
</p>
<p>creation focuses on identifying and expanding the connections between societal and 
</p>
<p>economic progress.
</p>
<p>The concept rests on the premise that both economic and social progress must be 
</p>
<p>addressed using value principles. Value is defined as benefits relative to costs, not 
</p>
<p>just benefits alone. Value creation is an idea that has long been recognized in busi-
</p>
<p>ness, where profit is revenues earned from customers minus the costs incurred. 
</p>
<p>However, businesses have rarely approached societal issues from a value perspec-
</p>
<p>tive but have treated them as peripheral matters. This has obscured the connections 
</p>
<p>between economic and social concerns.
</p>
<p>In the social sector, thinking in value terms is even less common. Social organi-
</p>
<p>zations and government entities often see success solely in terms of the benefits 
</p>
<p>achieved or the money expended. As governments and NGOs begin to think more in 
</p>
<p>value terms, their interest in collaborating with business will inevitably grow.
</p>
<p>This perspective has permeated management thinking for the past two decades. 
</p>
<p>Firms focused on enticing consumers to buy more and more of their products. 
</p>
<p>Facing growing competition and shorter- term performance pressures from share-
</p>
<p>holders, managers resorted to waves of restructuring, personnel reductions, and 
</p>
<p>relocation to lower-cost regions, while leveraging balance sheets to return capital to 
</p>
<p>investors. The results were often commoditization, price competition, little true 
</p>
<p>innovation, slow organic growth, and no clear competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>In this kind of competition, the communities in which companies operate per-
</p>
<p>ceive little benefit even as profits rise. Instead, they perceive that profits come at 
</p>
<p>their expense, an impression that has become even stronger in the current economic 
</p>
<p>recovery, in which rising earnings have done little to offset high unemployment, 
</p>
<p>local business distress, and severe pressures on community services.
</p>
<p>It was not always this way. The best companies once took on a broad range of 
</p>
<p>roles in meeting the needs of workers, communities, and supporting businesses. As 
</p>
<p>other social institutions appeared on the scene, however, these roles fell away or 
</p>
<p>were delegated. Shortening investor time horizons began to narrow thinking about 
</p>
<p>appropriate investments. As the vertically integrated firm gave way to greater reli-
</p>
<p>ance on outside vendors, outsourcing and offshoring weakened the connection 
</p>
<p>between firms and their communities. As firms moved disparate activities to more 
</p>
<p>and more locations, they often lost touch with any location. Indeed, many compa-
</p>
<p>nies no longer recognize a home&mdash;but see themselves as &ldquo;global&rdquo; companies.
</p>
<p>These transformations drove major progress in economic efficiency. However, 
</p>
<p>something profoundly important was lost in the process, as more fundamental 
</p>
<p>16 Creating Shared Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>328
</p>
<p>opportunities for value creation were missed. The scope of strategic thinking 
</p>
<p>contracted.
</p>
<p>Strategy theory holds that to be successful, a company must create a distinctive 
</p>
<p>value proposition that meets the needs of a chosen set of customers. The firm gains 
</p>
<p>competitive advantage from how it configures the value chain, or the set of activities 
</p>
<p>involved in creating, producing, selling, delivering, and supporting its products or 
</p>
<p>services. For decades businesspeople have studied positioning and the best ways to 
</p>
<p>design activities and integrate them. However, companies have overlooked opportu-
</p>
<p>nities to meet fundamental societal needs and misunderstood how societal harms and 
</p>
<p>weaknesses affect value chains. Our field of vision has simply been too narrow.
</p>
<p>In understanding the business environment, managers have focused most of their 
</p>
<p>attention on the industry, or the particular business in which the firm competes. This 
</p>
<p>is because industry structure has a decisive impact on a firm&rsquo;s profitability. What has 
</p>
<p>been missed, however, is the profound effect that location can have on productivity 
</p>
<p>and innovation. Companies have failed to grasp the importance of the broader busi-
</p>
<p>ness environment surrounding their major operations.
</p>
<p> How Shared Value Is Created
</p>
<p>Companies can create economic value by creating societal value. There are three 
</p>
<p>distinct ways to do this: by reconceiving products and markets, redefining produc-
</p>
<p>tivity in the value chain, and building supportive industry clusters at the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>locations. Each of these is part of the virtuous circle of shared value; improving 
</p>
<p>value in one area gives rise to opportunities in the others.
</p>
<p>The concept of shared value resets the boundaries of capitalism. By better con-
</p>
<p>necting companies&rsquo; success with societal improvement, it opens up many ways to 
</p>
<p>serve new needs, gain efficiency, create differentiation, and expand markets.
</p>
<p>The ability to create shared value applies equally to advanced economies and 
</p>
<p>developing countries, though the specific opportunities will differ. The opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties will also differ markedly across industries and companies&mdash;but every company 
</p>
<p>has them. And their range and scope is far broader than has been recognized. [The 
</p>
<p>idea of shared value was initially explored in a December 2006 HBR article by 
</p>
<p>Michael E.&nbsp;Porter and Mark R.&nbsp;Kramer, &ldquo;Strategy and Society: The Link Between 
</p>
<p>Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility.&rdquo;]
</p>
<p> Reconceiving Products and&nbsp;Markets
</p>
<p>Society&rsquo;s needs are huge&mdash;health, better housing, improved nutrition, help for the 
</p>
<p>aging, greater financial security, less environmental damage. Arguably, they are the 
</p>
<p>greatest unmet needs in the global economy. In business we have spent decades 
</p>
<p>learning how to parse and manufacture demand while missing the most important 
</p>
<p>demand of all. Too many companies have lost sight of that most basic of questions: 
</p>
<p>Is our product good for our customers? Or for our customers&rsquo; customers?
</p>
<p>M. E. Porter and M. R. Kramer</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>329
</p>
<p>In advanced economies, demand for products and services that meet societal needs 
</p>
<p>is rapidly growing. Food companies that traditionally concentrated on taste and quan-
</p>
<p>tity to drive more and more consumption are refocusing on the fundamental need for 
</p>
<p>better nutrition. Intel and IBM are both devising ways to help utilities harness digital 
</p>
<p>intelligence in order to economize on power usage. Wells Fargo has developed a line 
</p>
<p>of products and tools that help customers budget, manage credit, and pay down debt. 
</p>
<p>Sales of GE&rsquo;s Ecomagination products reached $18&nbsp;billion in 2009&mdash;the size of a 
</p>
<p>Fortune 150 company. GE now predicts that revenues of Ecomagination products will 
</p>
<p>grow at twice the rate of total company revenues over the next five years.
</p>
<p>In these and many other ways, whole new avenues for innovation open up, and 
</p>
<p>shared value is created. Society&rsquo;s gains are even greater, because businesses will 
</p>
<p>often be far more effective than governments and nonprofits are at marketing that 
</p>
<p>motivates customers to embrace products and services that create societal benefits, 
</p>
<p>like healthier food or environmentally friendly products.

</p>
<p> Blurring the&nbsp;Profit/Nonprofit Boundary
</p>
<p>The concept of shared value blurs the line between for-profit and nonprofit organiza-
</p>
<p>tions. New kinds of hybrid enterprises are rapidly appearing. For example, 
</p>
<p>WaterHealth International, a fast-growing for profit, uses innovative water purifica-

<p>The Connection Between Competitive Advantage and Social Issues
</p>
<p>There are numerous ways in which addressing societal concerns can yield 
</p>
<p>productivity benefits to a firm. Consider, for example, what happens when a 
</p>
<p>firm invests in a wellness program. Society benefits because employees and 
</p>
<p>their families become healthier, and the firm minimizes employee absences 
</p>
<p>and lost productivity. The graphic below depicts some areas where the con-
</p>

<p>competitors. Waste concern, a hybrid profit/nonprofit enterprise started in Bangladesh 
</p>
<p>15 years ago, has built the capacity to convert 700 tons of trash, collected daily from 
</p>
<p>neighborhood slums, into organic fertilizer, thereby increasing crop yields and 
</p>
<p>reducing CO2 emissions. Seeded with capital from the lions club and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development programme, the company improves health conditions while 
</p>
<p>earning a substantial gross margin through fertilizer sales and carbon credits.
</p>
<p>The blurring of the boundary between successful for-profits and non-profits is 
</p>
<p>one of the strong signs that creating shared value is possible.
</p>
<p>Equal or greater opportunities arise from serving disadvantaged communities 
</p>
<p>and developing countries. Though societal needs are even more pressing there, these 
</p>
<p>communities have not been recognized as viable markets. Today attention is riveted 
</p>
<p>on India, China, and increasingly, Brazil, which offer firms the prospect of reaching 
</p>
<p>billions of new customers at the bottom of the pyramid&mdash;a notion persuasively artic-
</p>
<p>ulated by C.K.&nbsp;Prahalad. Yet these countries have always had huge needs, as do 
</p>
<p>many developing countries.
</p>
<p>Similar opportunities await in nontraditional communities in advanced countries. 
</p>
<p>We have learned, for example, that poor urban areas are America&rsquo;s most under-
</p>
<p>served market; their substantial concentrated purchasing power has often been over-
</p>
<p>looked. (See the research of the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, at icic.org.)
</p>
<p>The societal benefits of providing appropriate products to lower-income and disad-
</p>
<p>vantaged consumers can be profound, while the profits for companies can be substan-
</p>
<p>tial. For example, low-priced cell phones that provide mobile banking services, are 
</p>
<p>helping the poor save money securely and transforming the ability of small farmers to 
</p>
<p>produce and market their crops. In Kenya, Vodafone&rsquo;s M-PESA mobile banking ser-
</p>
<p>vice signed up 10 million customers in three years; the funds it handles now represent 
</p>
<p>11% of that country&rsquo;s GDP.&nbsp;In India, Thomson Reuters has developed a promising 
</p>
<p>monthly service for farmers who earn an average of $2,000 a year. For a fee of $5 a 
</p>
<p>quarter, it provides weather and crop pricing information and agricultural advice. The 
</p>
<p>service reaches an estimated 2 million farmers, and early research indicates that it has 
</p>
<p>helped increase the incomes of more than 60% of them&mdash;in some cases even tripling 
</p>
<p>incomes. As capitalism begins to work in poorer communities, new opportunities for 
</p>
<p>economic development and social progress increase exponentially.
</p>
<p>For a company, the starting point for creating this kind of shared value is to iden-
</p>
<p>tify all the societal needs, benefits, and harms that are or could be embodied in the 
</p>
<p>firm&rsquo;s products. The opportunities are not static; they change constantly as technol-
</p>
<p>ogy evolves, economies develop, and societal priorities shift. An ongoing explora-
</p>
<p>tion of societal needs will lead companies to discover new opportunities for 
</p>
<p>differentiation and repositioning in traditional markets, and to recognize the poten-
</p>
<p>tial of new markets they previously overlooked.
</p>
<p>Meeting needs in underserved markets often requires redesigned products or dif-
</p>
<p>ferent distribution methods. These requirements can trigger fundamental innova-
</p>
<p>tions that also have application in traditional markets. Microfinance, for example, 
</p>
<p>was invented to serve unmet financing needs in developing countries. Now it is 
</p>
<p>growing rapidly in the United States, where it is filling an important gap that was 
</p>
<p>unrecognized.

<p>16 Creating Shared Value</p>

</p>
<p> Redefining Productivity in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Value Chain
</p>
<p>A company&rsquo;s value chain inevitably affects&mdash;and is affected by&mdash;numerous societal 
</p>
<p>issues, such as natural resource and water use, health and safety, working condi-
</p>
<p>tions, and equal treatment in the workplace. Opportunities to create shared value 
</p>
<p>arise because societal problems can create economic costs in the firm&rsquo;s value chain. 
</p>
<p>Many so-called externalities actually inflict internal costs on the firm, even in the 
</p>
<p>absence of regulation or resource taxes. Excess packaging of products and green-
</p>
<p>house gases are not just costly to the environment but costly to the business. Wal- 
</p>
<p>Mart, for example, was able to address both issues by reducing its packaging and 
</p>
<p>rerouting its trucks to cut 100 million miles from its delivery routes in 2009, saving 
</p>
<p>$200 million even as it shipped more products. Innovation in disposing of plastic 
</p>
<p>used in stores has saved millions in lower disposal costs to landfills.
</p>
<p>By reducing its packaging and cutting 100 million miles from the delivery routes of its 
trucks, Wal-Mart lowered carbon emissions and saved $200 million in costs.
</p>
<p>The new thinking reveals that the congruence between societal progress and pro-
</p>
<p>ductivity in the value chain is far greater than traditionally believed (see the exhibit 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Connection Between Competitive Advantage and Social Issues&rdquo;). The syn-
</p>
<p>ergy increases when firms approach societal issues from a shared value perspective 
</p>
<p>and invent new ways of operating to address them. So far, however, few companies 
</p>
<p>have reaped the full productivity benefits in areas such as health, safety, environ-
</p>
<p>mental performance, and employee retention and capability.
</p>
<p>But there are unmistakable signs of change. Efforts to minimize pollution were 
</p>
<p>once thought to inevitably increase business costs&mdash;and to occur only because of 
</p>
<p>regulation and taxes. Today there is a growing consensus that major improvements 
</p>
<p>in environmental performance can often be achieved with better technology at nom-
</p>
<p>inal incremental cost and can even yield net cost savings through enhanced resource 
</p>
<p>utilization, process efficiency, and quality.
</p>
<p>In each of the areas in the exhibit, a deeper understanding of productivity and a 
</p>
<p>growing awareness of the fallacy of short-term cost reductions (which often actually 
</p>
<p>lower productivity or make it unsustainable) are giving rise to new approaches. The 
</p>
<p>following are some of the most important ways in which shared value thinking is 
</p>
<p>transforming the value chain, which are not independent but often mutually rein-
</p>
<p>forcing. Efforts in these and other areas are still works in process, whose implica-
</p>
<p>tions will be felt for years to come.
</p>
<p>Energy Use and Logistics The use of energy throughout the value chain is being 
</p>
<p>reexamined, whether it be in processes, transportation, buildings, supply chains, 
</p>
<p>distribution channels, or support services. Triggered by energy price spikes and a 
</p>
<p>new awareness of opportunities for energy efficiency, this reexamination was under 
</p>
<p>way even before carbon emissions became a global focus. The result has been strik-
</p>
<p>ing improvements in energy utilization through better technology, recycling, cogen-
</p>
<p>eration, and numerous other practices&mdash;all of which create shared value.
</p>

</p>
<p>We are learning that shipping is expensive, not just because of energy costs and 
</p>
<p>emissions but because it adds time, complexity, inventory costs, and management 
</p>
<p>costs. Logistical systems are beginning to be redesigned to reduce shipping dis-
</p>
<p>tances, streamline handling, improve vehicle routing, and the like. All of these steps 
</p>
<p>create shared value. The British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer&rsquo;s ambitious overhaul of 
</p>
<p>its supply chain, for example, which involves steps as simple as stopping the pur-
</p>
<p>chase of supplies from one hemisphere to ship to another, is expected to save the 
</p>
<p>retailer &pound;175 million annually by fiscal 2016, while hugely reducing carbon emis-
</p>
<p>sions. In the process of reexamining logistics, thinking about outsourcing and loca-
</p>
<p>tion will also be revised (as we will discuss below).
</p>
<p>Resource Use Heightened environmental awareness and advances in technology 
</p>
<p>are catalyzing new approaches in areas such as utilization of water, raw materials, 
</p>
<p>and packaging, as well as expanding recycling and reuse. The opportunities apply to 
</p>
<p>all resources, not just those that have been identified by environmentalists. Better 
</p>
<p>resource utilization&mdash;enabled by improving technology&mdash;will permeate all parts of 
</p>
<p>the value chain and will spread to suppliers and channels. Landfills will fill more 
</p>
<p>slowly.
</p>
<p>For example, Coca-Cola has already reduced its worldwide water consumption 
</p>
<p>by 9% from a 2004 baseline&mdash;nearly halfway to its goal of a 20% reduction by 
</p>
<p>2012. Dow Chemical managed to reduce consumption of fresh water at its largest 
</p>
<p>production site by one billion gallons&mdash;enough water to supply nearly 40,000 peo-
</p>
<p>ple in the U.S. for a year&mdash;resulting in savings of $4 million. The demand for water- 
</p>
<p>saving technology has allowed India&rsquo;s Jain Irrigation, a leading global manufacturer 
</p>
<p>of complete drip irrigation systems for water conservation, to achieve a 41% com-
</p>
<p>pound annual growth rate in revenue over the past five years.
</p>
<p>Procurement The traditional playbook calls for companies to commoditize and 
</p>
<p>exert maximum bargaining power on suppliers to drive down prices&mdash; even when 
</p>
<p>purchasing from small businesses or subsistence-level farmers. More recently, firms 
</p>
<p>have been rapidly outsourcing to suppliers in lower-wage locations.
</p>
<p>Today some companies are beginning to understand that marginalized suppliers 
</p>
<p>cannot remain productive or sustain, much less improve, their quality. By increasing 
</p>
<p>access to inputs, sharing technology, and providing financing, companies can 
</p>
<p>improve supplier quality and productivity while ensuring access to growing volume. 
</p>
<p>Improving productivity will often trump lower prices. As suppliers get stronger, 
</p>
<p>their environmental impact often falls dramatically, which further improves their 
</p>
<p>efficiency. Shared value is created.
</p>
<p>A good example of such new procurement thinking can be found at Nespresso, 
</p>
<p>one of Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s fastest- growing divisions, which has enjoyed annual growth of 30% 
</p>
<p>since 2000. Nespresso combines a sophisticated espresso machine with single-cup 
</p>
<p>aluminum capsules containing ground coffees from around the world. Offering 
</p>
<p>quality and convenience, Nespresso has expanded the market for premium coffee.
</p>
<p>16 Creating Shared Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>334
</p>
<p> The Role of&nbsp;Social Entrepreneurs
</p>
<p>Businesses are not the only players in finding profitable solutions to social prob-
</p>
<p>lems. A whole generation of social entrepreneurs is pioneering new product con-
</p>
<p>cepts that meet social needs using viable business models. Because they are not 
</p>
<p>locked into narrow traditional business thinking, social entrepreneurs are often well 
</p>
<p>ahead of established corporations in discovering these opportunities. Social enter-
</p>
<p>prises that create shared value can scale up far more rapidly than purely social pro-
</p>
<p>grams, which often suffer from an inability to grow and become self-sustaining.
</p>
<p>Real social entrepreneurship should be measured by its ability to create 
</p>
<p>shared value, not just social benefit.
</p>
<p>Obtaining a reliable supply of specialized coffees is extremely challenging, how-
</p>
<p>ever. Most coffees are grown by small farmers in impoverished rural areas of Africa 
</p>
<p>and Latin America, who are trapped in a cycle of low productivity, poor quality, and 
</p>
<p>environmental degradation that limits production volume. To address these issues, 
</p>
<p>Nestl&eacute; redesigned procurement. It worked intensively with its growers, providing 
</p>
<p>advice on farming practices, guaranteeing bank loans, and helping secure inputs 
</p>
<p>such as plant stock, pesticides, and fertilizers. Nestl&eacute; established local facilities to 
</p>
<p>measure the quality of the coffee at the point of purchase, which allowed it to pay a 
</p>
<p>premium for better beans directly to the growers and thus improve their incentives. 
</p>
<p>Greater yield per hectare and higher production quality increased growers&rsquo; incomes, 
</p>
<p>and the environmental impact of farms shrank. Meanwhile, Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s reliable supply 
</p>
<p>of good coffee grew significantly. Shared value was created.
</p>
<p>Embedded in the Nestl&eacute; example is a far broader insight, which is the advantage 
</p>
<p>of buying from capable local suppliers. Outsourcing to other locations and countries 
</p>
<p>creates transaction costs and inefficiencies that can offset lower wage and input 
</p>
<p>costs. Capable local suppliers help firms avoid these costs and can reduce cycle 
</p>
<p>time, increase flexibility, foster faster learning, and enable innovation. Buying local 
</p>
<p>includes not only local companies but also local units of national or international 
</p>
<p>companies. When firms buy locally, their suppliers can get stronger, increase their 
</p>
<p>profits, hire more people, and pay better wages&mdash;all of which will benefit other 
</p>
<p>businesses in the community. Shared value is created.
</p>
<p>Distribution Companies are beginning to re-examine distribution practices from a 
</p>
<p>shared value perspective. As iTunes, Kindle, and Google Scholar (which offers texts 
</p>
<p>of scholarly literature online) demonstrate, profitable new distribution models can 
</p>
<p>also dramatically reduce paper and plastic usage. Similarly, microfinance has cre-
</p>
<p>ated a cost-efficient new model of distributing financial services to small 
</p>
<p>businesses.
</p>
<p>Opportunities for new distribution models can be even greater in nontraditional 
</p>
<p>markets. For example, Hindustan Unilever is creating a new direct- to-home distribu-
</p>
<p>tion system, run by underprivileged female entrepreneurs, in Indian villages of fewer 
</p>
<p>than 2,000 people. Unilever provides micro- credit and training and now has more 
</p>
<p>than 45,000 entrepreneurs covering some 100,000 villages across 15 Indian states. 
</p>
<p>Project Shakti, as this distribution system is called, benefits communities not only by 
</p>
<p>M. E. Porter and M. R. Kramer</p>

<p>335
</p>
<p>giving women skills that often double their household income but also by reducing 
</p>
<p>the spread of communicable diseases through increased access to hygiene products. 
</p>
<p>This is a good example of how the unique ability of business to market to hard- to-
</p>
<p>reach consumers can benefit society by getting life-altering products into the hands 
</p>
<p>of people that need them. Project Shakti now accounts for 5% of Unilever&rsquo;s total 
</p>
<p>revenues in India and has extended the company&rsquo;s reach into rural areas and built its 
</p>
<p>brand in media-dark regions, creating major economic value for the company.
</p>
<p>By investing in employee wellness programs, Johnson &amp; Johnson has saved $250 million 
on health care costs.
</p>
<p>Employee Productivity The focus on holding down wage levels, reducing bene-
</p>
<p>fits, and offshoring is beginning to give way to an awareness of the positive effects 
</p>
<p>that a living wage, safety, wellness, training, and opportunities for advancement for 
</p>
<p>employees have on productivity. Many companies, for example, traditionally sought 
</p>
<p>to minimize the cost of &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; employee health care coverage or even elimi-
</p>
<p>nate health coverage altogether. Today leading companies have learned that because 
</p>
<p>of lost workdays and diminished employee productivity, poor health costs them 
</p>
<p>more than health benefits do. Take Johnson &amp; Johnson. By helping employees stop 
</p>
<p>smoking (a two-thirds reduction in the past 15&nbsp;years) and implementing numerous 
</p>
<p>other wellness programs, the company has saved $250 million on health care costs, 
</p>
<p>a return of $2.71 for every dollar spent on wellness from 2002 to 2008. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson has benefited from a more present and productive workforce. If 
</p>
<p>labor unions focused more on shared value, too, these kinds of employee approaches 
</p>
<p>would spread even faster.
</p>
<p>Location Business thinking has embraced the myth that location no longer mat-
</p>
<p>ters, because logistics are inexpensive, information flows rapidly, and markets are 
</p>
<p>global. The cheaper the location, then, the better. Concern about the local communi-
</p>
<p>ties in which a company operates has faded.
</p>
<p>That oversimplified thinking is now being challenged, partly by the rising costs 
</p>
<p>of energy and carbon emissions but also by a greater recognition of the productivity 
</p>
<p>cost of highly dispersed production systems and the hidden costs of distant procure-
</p>
<p>ment discussed earlier. Wal-Mart, for example, is increasingly sourcing produce for 
</p>
<p>its food sections from local farms near its warehouses. It has discovered that the 
</p>
<p>savings on transportation costs and the ability to restock in smaller quantities more 
</p>
<p>than offset the lower prices of industrial farms farther away. Nestl&eacute; is establishing 
</p>
<p>smaller plants closer to its markets and stepping up efforts to maximize the use of 
</p>
<p>locally available materials.
</p>
<p>The calculus of locating activities in developing countries is also changing. Olam 
</p>
<p>International, a leading cashew producer, traditionally shipped its nuts from Africa 
</p>
<p>to Asia for processing at facilities staffed by productive Asian workers. But by open-
</p>
<p>ing local processing plants and training workers in Tanzania, Mozambique, Nigeria, 
</p>
<p>and C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Olam has cut processing and shipping costs by as much as 
</p>
<p>16 Creating Shared Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>336
</p>
<p>25%&mdash;not to mention, greatly reduced carbon emissions. In making this move, 
</p>
<p>Olam also built preferred relationships with local farmers. And it has provided 
</p>
<p>direct employment to 17,000 people&mdash;95% of whom are women&mdash;and indirect 
</p>
<p>employment to an equal number of people, in rural areas where jobs otherwise were 
</p>
<p>not available.
</p>
<p>These trends may well lead companies to remake their value chains by moving 
</p>
<p>some activities closer to home and having fewer major production locations. Until 
</p>
<p>now, many companies have thought that being global meant moving production to 
</p>
<p>locations with the lowest labor costs and designing their supply chains to achieve the 
</p>
<p>most immediate impact on expenses. In reality, the strongest international competi-
</p>
<p>tors will often be those that can establish deeper roots in important communities. 
</p>
<p>Companies that can embrace this new locational thinking will create shared value.
</p>
<p>AS THESE examples illustrate, reimagining value chains from the perspective 
</p>
<p>of shared value will offer significant new ways to innovate and unlock new eco-
</p>
<p>nomic value that most businesses have missed.

</p>
<p> Enabling Local Cluster Development
</p>
<p>No company is self-contained. The success of every company is affected by the sup-
</p>
<p>porting companies and infrastructure around it. Productivity and innovation are 
</p>
<p>strongly influenced by &ldquo;clusters,&rdquo; or geographic concentrations of firms, related 
</p>
<p>businesses, suppliers, service providers, and logistical infrastructure in a particular 
</p>
<p>field&mdash;such as IT in Silicon Valley, cut flowers in Kenya, and diamond cutting in 
</p>
<p>Surat, India.
</p>
<p>Clusters include not only businesses but institutions such as academic programs, 
</p>
<p>trade associations, and standards organizations. They also draw on the broader pub-
</p>
<p>lic assets in the surrounding community, such as schools and universities, clean 
</p>
<p>water, fair- competition laws, quality standards, and market transparency.
</p>
<p>Clusters are prominent in all successful and growing regional economies and 
</p>
<p>play a crucial role in driving productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. Capable 
</p>
<p>local suppliers foster greater logistical efficiency and ease of collaboration, as we 
</p>
<p>have discussed. Stronger local capabilities in such areas as training, transportation 
</p>
<p>services, and related industries also boost productivity. Without a supporting cluster, 
</p>
<p>conversely, productivity suffers.
</p>
<p>Deficiencies in the framework conditions surrounding the cluster also create 
</p>
<p>internal costs for firms. Poor public education imposes productivity and remedial- 
</p>
<p>training costs. Poor transportation infrastructure drives up the costs of logistics. 
</p>
<p>Gender or racial discrimination reduces the pool of capable employees. Poverty 
</p>
<p>limits the demand for products and leads to environmental degradation, unhealthy 
</p>
<p>workers, and high security costs. As companies have increasingly become discon-
</p>
<p>nected from their communities, however, their influence in solving these problems 
</p>
<p>has waned even as their costs have grown.
</p>
<p>Firms create shared value by building clusters to improve company productivity 
</p>
<p>while addressing gaps or failures in the framework conditions surrounding the clus-
</p>
<p>ter. Efforts to develop or attract capable suppliers, for example, enable the procure-
</p>
<p>ment benefits we discussed earlier. A focus on clusters and location has been all but 
</p>
<p>absent in management thinking. Cluster thinking has also been missing in many 
</p>
<p>economic development initiatives, which have failed because they involved isolated 
</p>
<p>interventions and overlooked critical complementary investments.
</p>
<p>A key aspect of cluster building in developing and developed countries alike is 
</p>
<p>the formation of open and transparent markets. In inefficient or monopolized mar-
</p>
<p>kets where workers are exploited, where suppliers do not receive fair prices, and 
</p>
<p>where price transparency is lacking, productivity suffers. Enabling fair and open 
</p>
<p>markets, which is often best done in conjunction with partners, can allow a company 
</p>
<p>to secure reliable supplies and give suppliers better incentives for quality and effi-
</p>
<p>ciency while also substantially improving the incomes and purchasing power of 
</p>
<p>local citizens. A positive cycle of economic and social development results.
</p>
<p>When a firm builds clusters in its key locations, it also amplifies the connection 
</p>
<p>between its success and its communities&rsquo; success. A firm&rsquo;s growth has multiplier 
</p>
<p>effects, as jobs are created in supporting industries, new companies are seeded, and 
</p>
<p>demand for ancillary services rises. A company&rsquo;s efforts to improve framework

</p>
<p>conditions for the cluster spill over to other participants and the local economy. 
</p>
<p>Workforce development initiatives, for example, increase the supply of skilled 
</p>
<p>employees for many other firms as well.
</p>
<p>At Nespresso, Nestl&eacute; also worked to build clusters, which made its new procure-
</p>
<p>ment practices far more effective. It set out to build agricultural, technical, financial, 
</p>
<p>and logistical firms and capabilities in each coffee region, to further support effi-
</p>
<p>ciency and high-quality local production. Nestl&eacute; led efforts to increase access to 
</p>
<p>Creating Shared Value: Implications for Government and Civil Society
</p>
<p>While our focus here is primarily on companies, the principles of shared 
</p>
<p>value apply equally to governments and nonprofit organizations.
</p>
<p>Governments and NGOs will be most effective if they think in value 
</p>
<p>terms&mdash; considering benefits relative to costs&mdash;and focus on the results 
</p>
<p>achieved rather than the funds and effort expended. Activists have tended to 
</p>
<p>approach social improvement from an ideological or absolutist perspective, as 
</p>
<p>if social benefits should be pursued at any cost. Governments and NGOs often 
</p>
<p>assume that trade-offs between economic and social benefits are inevitable, 
</p>
<p>exacerbating these trade-offs through their approaches. For example, much 
</p>
<p>environmental regulation still takes the form of command-and-control man-
</p>
<p>dates and enforcement actions designed to embarrass and punish companies.
</p>
<p>Regulators would accomplish much more by focusing on measuring envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental performance and introducing standards, phase-in periods, and sup-
</p>
<p>port for technology that would promote innovation, improve the environment, 
</p>
<p>and increase competitiveness simultaneously.
</p>
<p>The principle of shared value creation cuts across the traditional 
</p>
<p>divide between the responsibilities of business and those of government 
</p>
<p>or civil society. From society&rsquo;s perspective, it does not matter what types 
</p>
<p>of organizations created the value. What matters is that benefits are 
</p>
<p>delivered by those organizations&mdash;or combinations of organizations&mdash;
</p>
<p>that are best positioned to achieve the most impact for the least cost. 
</p>
<p>Finding ways to boost productivity is equally valuable whether in the service 
</p>
<p>of commercial or societal objectives. In short, the principle of value creation 
</p>
<p>should guide the use of resources across all areas of societal concern.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, a new type of NGO has emerged that understands the impor-
</p>
<p>tance of productivity and value creation. Such organizations have often had a 
</p>
<p>remarkable impact. One example is TechnoServe, which has partnered with 
</p>
<p>both regional and global corporations to promote the development of com-
</p>
<p>petitive agricultural clusters in more than 30 countries. Root capital accom-
</p>
<p>plishes a similar objective by providing financing to farmers and businesses 
</p>
<p>that are too large for micro- finance but too small for normal bank financing. 
</p>
<p>Since 2000, Root capital has lent more than $200 million to 282 businesses 
</p>
<p>through which it has reached 400,000 farmers and artisans. It has financed the 
</p>
<p>cultivation of 1.4 million acres of organic agriculture in Latin America and 
</p>

</p>
<p>Africa. Root capital regularly works with corporations, utilizing future pur-
</p>
<p>chase orders as collateral for its loans to farmers and helping to strengthen 
</p>
<p>corporate supply chains and improve the quality of purchased inputs.
</p>
<p>Some private foundations have begun to see the power of working with 
</p>
<p>businesses to create shared value. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, for 
</p>
<p>example, has formed partnerships with leading global corporations to foster 
</p>
<p>agricultural clusters in developing countries. The foundation carefully focuses 
</p>
<p>on commodities where climate and soil conditions give a particular region a 
</p>
<p>true competitive advantage. The partnerships bring in NGOs like TechnoServe 
</p>
<p>and Root capital, as well as government officials, to work on precompetitive 
</p>
<p>issues that improve the cluster and upgrade the value chain for all participants. 
</p>
<p>This approach recognizes that helping small farmers increase their yields will 
</p>
<p>not create any lasting benefits unless there are ready buyers for their crops, 
</p>
<p>other enterprises that can process the crops once they are harvested, and a 
</p>
<p>local cluster that includes efficient logistical infrastructure, input availability, 
</p>
<p>and the like. The active engagement of corporations is essential to mobilizing 
</p>
<p>these elements.
</p>
<p>Forward-thinking foundations can also serve as honest brokers and allay 
</p>
<p>fears by mitigating power imbalances between small local enterprises, NGOs, 
</p>
<p>governments, and companies. Such efforts will require a new assumption that 
</p>
<p>shared value can come only as a result of effective collaboration among all 
</p>
<p>parties.

</p>
<p>Government Regulation and Shared Value
</p>
<p>The right kind of government regulation can encourage companies to 
</p>
<p>pursue shared value; the wrong kind works against it and even makes 
</p>
<p>trade-offs between economic and social goals inevitable.
</p>
<p>Regulation is necessary for well-functioning markets, something that 
</p>
<p>became abundantly clear during the became abundantly clear during the 
</p>
<p>recent financial crisis. However, the ways in which regulations are designed 
</p>
<p>and implemented determine whether they benefit society or work against it.
</p>
<p>Regulations that enhance shared value set goals and stimulate innovation. 
</p>
<p>They highlight a societal objective and create societal objective and create a 
</p>
<p>level playing field to encourage companies to invest in shared value rather 
</p>
<p>than maximize short-term profit. Such regulations have a number of 
</p>
<p>characteristics:
</p>
<p>First, they set clear and measurable social goals, whether they involve 
</p>
<p>energy use, health matters, or safety. Where appropriate, they set prices for 
</p>
<p>resources (such as water) that reflect true costs. Second, they set performance 
</p>
<p>standards but do not prescribe the methods to achieve them&mdash;those are left to 
</p>
<p>companies. Third, they define phase-in periods for meeting standards, which 
</p>
<p>reflect the investment or new-product cycle in the industry. Phase-in periods 
</p>
<p>give companies time to develop and introduce new products and processes in 
</p>
<p>a way consistent with the economics of their business. Fourth, they put in 
</p>
<p>place universal measurement and performance reporting systems, with gov-
</p>
<p>ernment investing in infrastructure for collecting reliable benchmarking data 
</p>
<p>(such as nutritional deficiencies in each community). This motivates and 
</p>
<p>enables continual improvement beyond current targets. Finally, appropriate 
</p>
<p>regulations require efficient and timely reporting of results, which can then be 
</p>
<p>audited by the government as necessary, rather than impose detailed and 
</p>
<p>expensive compliance processes on everyone.
</p>
<p>Regulation that discourages shared value looks very different. It forces 
</p>
<p>compliance with particular practices, rather than focusing on measurable 
</p>
<p>social improvement. It mandates a particular approach to meeting a stan-
</p>
<p>dard&mdash;blocking innovation and almost always inflicting cost on companies. 
</p>
<p>When governments fall into the trap of this sort of regulation, they undermine 
</p>
<p>the very progress that they seek while triggering fierce resistance from busi-
</p>
<p>ness that slows progress further and blocks shared value that would improve 
</p>
<p>competitiveness.
</p>
<p>To be sure, companies locked into the old mind-set will resist even well- 
</p>
<p>constructed regulation. As shared value principles become more widely 
</p>
<p>accepted, however, business and government will become more aligned on 
</p>
<p>regulation in many areas. Companies will come to understand that the right 
</p>
<p>kind of regulation can actually foster economic value creation.
</p>
<p>Finally, regulation will be needed to limit the pursuit of exploitative, unfair, 
</p>
<p>or deceptive practices in which companies deceptive practices in which

</p>
<p>essential agricultural inputs such as plant stock, fertilizers, and irrigation equip-
</p>
<p>ment; strengthen regional farmer co-ops by helping them finance shared wet- milling 
</p>
<p>facilities for producing higher-quality beans; and support an extension program to 
</p>
<p>advise all farmers on growing techniques. It also worked in partnership with the 
</p>
<p>Rainforest Alliance, a leading international NGO, to teach farmers more- sustainable 
</p>
<p>practices that make production volumes more reliable.
</p>
<p>In the process, Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s productivity improved.
</p>
<p>A good example of a company working to improve framework conditions in its 
</p>
<p>cluster is Yara, the world&rsquo;s largest mineral fertilizer company. Yara realized that the 
</p>
<p>lack of logistical infrastructure in many parts of Africa was preventing farmers from 
</p>
<p>gaining efficient access to fertilizers and other essential agricultural inputs, and 
</p>
<p>from transporting their crops efficiently to market. Yara is tackling this problem 
</p>
<p>through a $60 million investment in a program to improve ports and roads, which is 
</p>
<p>designed to create agricultural growth corridors in Mozambique and Tanzania. The 
</p>
<p>company is working on this initiative with local governments and support from the 
</p>
<p>Norwegian government. In Mozambique alone, the corridor is expected to benefit 
</p>
<p>companies antitrust policy, for example, is essential to ensure that the benefits 
</p>
<p>of company success flow to customers, suppliers, and workers.

</p>
<p>more than 200,000 small farmers and create 350,000 new jobs. The improvements 
</p>
<p>will help Yara grow its business but will support the whole agricultural cluster, cre-
</p>
<p>ating huge multiplier effects.
</p>
<p>The benefits of cluster building apply not only in emerging economies but also in 
</p>
<p>advanced countries. North Carolina&rsquo;s Research Triangle is a notable example of 
</p>
<p>public and private collaboration that has created shared value by developing clusters 
</p>
<p>in such areas as information technology and life sciences. That region, which has 
</p>
<p>benefited from continued investment from both the private sector and local govern-
</p>
<p>ment, has experienced huge growth in employment, incomes, and company perfor-
</p>
<p>mance, and has fared better than most during the downturn.
</p>
<p>To support cluster development in the communities in which they operate, com-
</p>
<p>panies need to identify gaps and deficiencies in areas such as logistics, suppliers, 
</p>
<p>distribution channels, training, market organization, and educational institutions. 
</p>
<p>Then the task is to focus on the weaknesses that represent the greatest constraints to 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s own productivity and growth, and distinguish those areas that the 
</p>
<p>company is best equipped to influence directly from those in which collaboration is 
</p>
<p>more cost effective. Here is where the shared value opportunities will be greatest. 
</p>
<p>Initiatives that address cluster weaknesses that constrain companies will be much 
</p>
<p>more effective than community-focused corporate social responsibility programs, 
</p>
<p>which often have ternal influences on corporate success. It highlights the immense 
</p>
<p>human needs to be met, the large new markets to serve, and the internal costs of 
</p>
<p>social and community deficits&mdash;as well as the competitive advantages available 
</p>
<p>from addressing them. Until recently, companies have simply not approached their 
</p>
<p>businesses this way.
</p>
<p>Creating shared value will be more effective and far more sustainable than the 
</p>
<p>majority of today&rsquo;s corporate efforts in the social arena. Companies will make real 
</p>
<p>strides on the environment, for example, when they treat it as a productivity driver 
</p>
<p>rather than a feel-good response to external pressure. Or consider limited impact 
</p>
<p>because they take on too many areas without focusing on value.
</p>
<p>But efforts to enhance infrastructure and institutions in a region often require 
</p>
<p>collective action, as the Nestl&eacute;, Yara, and Research Triangle examples show. 
</p>
<p>Companies should try to enlist partners to share the cost, win support, and assemble 
</p>
<p>the right skills. The most successful cluster development programs are ones that 
</p>
<p>involve collaboration within the private sector, as well as trade associations, govern-
</p>
<p>ment agencies, and NGOs.
</p>
<p>Not all profit is equal. Profits involving a social purpose represent a higher form of capital-
ism, one that creates a positive cycle of company and community prosperity.
</p>
<p> Creating Shared Value in&nbsp;Practice
</p>
<p>Not all profit is equal&mdash;an idea that has been lost in the narrow, short-term focus of 
</p>
<p>financial markets and in much management thinking. Profits involving a social pur-
</p>
<p>pose represent a higher form of capitalism&mdash;one that will enable society to advance 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>343
</p>
<p>more rapidly while allowing companies to grow even more. The result is a positive 
</p>
<p>cycle of company and community prosperity, which leads to profits that endure.
</p>
<p>Creating shared value presumes compliance with the law and ethical standards, 
</p>
<p>as well as mitigating any harm caused by the business, but goes far beyond that. The 
</p>
<p>opportunity to create economic value through creating societal value will be one of 
</p>
<p>the most powerful forces driving growth in the global economy. This thinking rep-
</p>
<p>resents a new way of understanding customers, productivity, and the ex-access to 
</p>
<p>housing. A shared value approach would have led financial services companies to 
</p>
<p>create innovative products that prudently increased access to home ownership. This 
</p>
<p>was recognized by the Mexican construction company Urbi, which pioneered a 
</p>
<p>mortgage-financing &ldquo;rent-to-own&rdquo; plan. Major U.S. banks, in contrast, promoted 
</p>
<p>unsustainable financing vehicles that turned out to be socially and economically 
</p>
<p>devastating, while claiming they were socially responsible because they had chari-
</p>
<p>table contribution programs.
</p>
<p>Inevitably, the most fertile opportunities for creating shared value will be closely 
</p>
<p>related to a company&rsquo;s particular business, and in areas most important to the busi-
</p>
<p>ness. Here a company can benefit the most economically and hence sustain its com-
</p>
<p>mitment over time. Here is also where a company brings the most resources to bear, 
</p>
<p>and where its scale and market presence equip it to have a meaningful impact on a 
</p>
<p>societal problem.
</p>
<p>Ironically, many of the shared value pioneers have been those with more-limited 
</p>
<p>resources&mdash;social entrepreneurs and companies in developing countries. These out-
</p>
<p>siders have been able to see the opportunities more clearly. In the process, the dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between for-profits and nonprofits is blurring.
</p>
<p>How Shared Value Differs from Corporate Social Responsibility
</p>
<p>Creating shared value (csv) should supersede corporate social responsibility 
</p>
<p>(CSR) in guiding the investments of companies in their communities. CSR 
</p>
<p>programs focus mostly on reputation and have only a limited connection to 
</p>
<p>the business, making them hard to justify and maintain over the long run. In 
</p>
<p>contrast, CSV is integral to a company&rsquo;s profitability and competitive posi-
</p>
<p>tion. It leverages the unique resources and expertise of the company to create 
</p>
<p>economic value by creating social value.

</p>
<p>&gt; impact limited by corporate footprint  
and CSR budget
</p>
<p>&gt; realigns the entire company budget
</p>
<p>Example: Fair trade purchasing Example: Transforming procurement  
to increase quality and yield
</p>
<p>In both cases, compliance with laws and ethical standards and reducing 
</p>
<p>harm from corporate activities are assumed
</p>
<p>Shared value is defining a whole new set of best practices that all companies 
</p>
<p>must embrace. It will also become an integral part of strategy. The essence of strat-
</p>
<p>egy is choosing a unique positioning and a distinctive value chain to deliver on it. 
</p>
<p>Shared value opens up many new needs to meet, new products to offer, new custom-
</p>
<p>ers to serve, and new ways to configure the value chain. And the competitive advan-
</p>
<p>tages that arise from creating shared value will often be more sustainable than 
</p>
<p>conventional cost and quality improvements. The cycle of imitation and zero-sum 
</p>
<p>competition can be broken.
</p>
<p>The opportunities to create shared value are widespread and growing. Not every 
</p>
<p>company will have them in every area, but our experience has been that companies 
</p>
<p>discover more and more opportunities over time as their line operating units grasp 
</p>
<p>this concept. It has taken a decade, but GE&rsquo;s Ecomagination initiative, for example, 
</p>
<p>is now producing a stream of fast-growing products and services across the 
</p>
<p>company.
</p>
<p>A shared value lens can be applied to every major company decision. Could our 
</p>
<p>product design incorporate greater social benefits? Are we serving all the communi-
</p>
<p>ties that would benefit from our products? Do our processes and logistical approaches 
</p>
<p>maximize efficiencies in energy and water use? Could our new plant be constructed 
</p>
<p>in a way that achieves greater community impact? How are gaps in our cluster hold-
</p>
<p>ing back our efficiency and speed of innovation? How could we enhance our com-
</p>
<p>munity as a business location? If sites are comparable economically, at which one 
</p>
<p>will the local community benefit the most? If a company can improve societal con-
</p>
<p>ditions, it will often improve business conditions and thereby trigger positive feed-
</p>
<p>back loops
</p>
<p>The three avenues for creating shared value are mutually reinforcing. Enhancing 
</p>
<p>the cluster, for example, will enable more local procurement and less dispersed sup-
</p>
<p>ply chains. New products and services that meet social needs or serve overlooked 
</p>
<p>markets will require new value chain choices in areas such as production, market-
</p>
<p>ing, and distribution. And new value chain configurations will create demand for 
</p>
<p>equipment and technology that save energy, conserve resources, and support 
</p>
<p>employees.
</p>
<p>Creating shared value will require concrete and tailored metrics for each busi-
</p>
<p>ness unit in each of the three areas. While some companies have begun to track 
</p>
<p>M. E. Porter and M. R. Kramer</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>345
</p>
<p>various social impacts, few have yet tied them to their economic interests at the 
</p>
<p>business level.
</p>
<p>Shared value creation will involve new and heightened forms of collaboration. 
</p>
<p>While some shared value opportunities are possible for a company to seize on its 
</p>
<p>own, others will benefit from insights, skills, and resources that cut across profit/
</p>
<p>nonprofit and private/public boundaries. Here, companies will be less successful if 
</p>
<p>they attempt to tackle societal problems on their own, especially those involving 
</p>
<p>cluster development. Major competitors may also need to work together on precom-
</p>
<p>petitive framework conditions, something that has not been common in reputation- 
</p>
<p>driven CSR initiatives. Successful collaboration will be data driven, clearly linked 
</p>
<p>to defined outcomes, well connected to the goals of all stakeholders, and tracked 
</p>
<p>with clear metrics.
</p>
<p>Governments and NGOs can enable and reinforce shared value or work against 
</p>
<p>it. (For more on this topic, see the sidebar &ldquo;Government Regulation and Shared 
</p>
<p>Value.&rdquo;)
</p>
<p> The Next Evolution in&nbsp;Capitalism
</p>
<p>Shared value holds the key to unlocking the next wave of business innovation and 
</p>
<p>growth. It will also reconnect company success and community success in ways that 
</p>
<p>have been lost in an age of narrow management approaches, short-term thinking, 
</p>
<p>and deepening divides among society&rsquo;s institutions.
</p>
<p>Shared value focuses companies on the right kind of profits&mdash;profits that create 
</p>
<p>societal benefits rather than diminish them. Capital markets will undoubtedly con-
</p>
<p>tinue to pressure companies to generate short-term profits, and some companies will 
</p>
<p>surely continue to reap profits at the expense of societal needs. But such profits will 
</p>
<p>often prove to be short- lived, and far greater opportunities will be missed.
</p>
<p>The moment for an expanded view of value creation has come. A host of factors, 
</p>
<p>such as the growing social awareness of employees and citizens and the increased 
</p>
<p>scarcity of natural resources, will drive unprecedented opportunities to create shared 
</p>
<p>value.
</p>
<p>We need a more sophisticated form of capitalism, one imbued with a social pur-
</p>
<p>pose. But that purpose should arise not out of charity but out of a deeper understand-
</p>
<p>ing of competition and economic value creation. This next evolution in the capitalist 
</p>
<p>model recognizes new and better ways to develop products, serve markets, and build 
</p>
<p>productive enterprises.
</p>
<p>Creating shared value represents a broader conception of Adam Smith&rsquo;s invisible 
</p>
<p>hand. It opens the doors of the pin factory to a wider set of influences. It is not phi-
</p>
<p>lanthropy but self-interested behavior to create economic value by creating societal 
</p>
<p>value. If all companies individually pursued shared value connected to their particu-
</p>
<p>lar businesses, society&rsquo;s overall interests would be served. And companies would 
</p>
<p>acquire legitimacy in the eyes of the communities in which they operated, which 
</p>
<p>would allow democracy to work as governments set policies that fostered and 
</p>
<p>16 Creating Shared Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>346
</p>
<p>supported business. Survival of the fittest would still prevail, but market competition 
</p>
<p>would benefit society in ways we have lost.
</p>
<p>Creating shared value represents a new approach to managing that cuts across 
</p>
<p>disciplines. Because of the traditional divide between economic concerns and social 
</p>
<p>ones, people in the public and private sectors have often followed very different 
</p>
<p>educational and career paths. As a result, few managers have the understanding of 
</p>
<p>social and environmental issues required to move beyond today&rsquo;s CSR approaches, 
</p>
<p>and few social sector leaders have the managerial training and entrepreneurial mind- 
</p>
<p>set needed to design and implement shared value models. Most business schools 
</p>
<p>still teach the narrow view of capitalism, even though more and more of their gradu-
</p>
<p>ates hunger for a greater sense of purpose and a growing number are drawn to social 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurship. The results have been missed opportunity and public cynicism.
</p>
<p>Business school curricula will need to broaden in a number of areas. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, the efficient use and stewardship of all forms of resources will define the next- 
</p>
<p>generation thinking on value chains. Customer behavior and marketing courses will 
</p>
<p>have to move beyond persuasion and demand creation to the study of deeper human 
</p>
<p>needs and how to serve nontraditional customer groups. Clusters, and the broader 
</p>
<p>locational influences on company productivity and innovation, will form a new core 
</p>
<p>discipline in business schools; economic development will no longer be left only to 
</p>
<p>public policy and economics departments. Business and government courses will 
</p>
<p>examine the economic impact of societal factors on enterprises, moving beyond the 
</p>
<p>effects of regulation and macroeconomics. And finance will need to rethink how 
</p>
<p>capital markets can actually support true value creation in companies&mdash;their funda-
</p>
<p>mental purpose&mdash;not just benefit financial market participants.
</p>
<p>There is nothing soft about the concept of shared value. These proposed changes 
</p>
<p>in business school curricula are not qualitative and do not depart from economic 
</p>
<p>value creation. Instead, they represent the next stage in our understanding of mar-
</p>
<p>kets, competition, and business management.
</p>
<p>NOT ALL societal problems can be solved through shared value solutions. But 
</p>
<p>shared value offers corporations the opportunity to utilize their skills, resources, and 
</p>
<p>management capability to lead social progress in ways that even the best- intentioned 
</p>
<p>governmental and social sector organizations can rarely match. In the process, busi-
</p>
<p>nesses can earn the respect of society again.

<p>&ldquo;The capitalist system is under siege&rdquo; (Porter and Kramer 2011: 64), but companies, 
</p>
<p>Michael E.&nbsp; Porter and Mark R.&nbsp; Kramer tell us in their latest Harvard Business 
</p>
<p>Review article, can push back and triumph with the guidance provided by a mana-
</p>
<p>gerial framework they call &ldquo;Creating Shared Value&rdquo; (CSV). The siege is at the hands 
</p>
<p>of civil society and governments, and the target is the legitimacy of modern day 
</p>
<p>global business, now &ldquo;fallen to levels not seen in recent history&rdquo; (Porter and Kramer 
</p>
<p>2011: 64). The syndrome, the authors tell us, is a vicious cycle born from the propo-
</p>
<p>sition that business and society are separate from each other.
</p>
<p>The business strategies that follow from the idea that business and society are 
</p>
<p>separate have flooded society with a barrage of externalities&mdash;environmental, politi-
</p>
<p>cal, moral, social and otherwise. Governments often respond by imposing (whether 
</p>
<p>or not successfully) regulations that would internalize these costs through strict con-
</p>
<p>straints (hard laws). Such regulations, in Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s view, sap the vibrancy 
</p>
<p>of capitalism. Nevertheless, civil society clamors for companies to go even further 
</p>
<p>than the hard law of existing regulations with voluntary corporate social responsi-
</p>
<p>bility (CSR) initiatives. According to Porter and Kramer, CSR pressures also tamper 
</p>
<p>with the virtue of capitalism. Both regulation and CSR are to be avoided, and that 
</p>
<p>means managers must proactively turn this bad news around. The way to do so, 
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer say, is through their creating shared value (CSV) framework, 
</p>
<p>starting from the idea that &ldquo;what&rsquo;s good for society is good for business&rdquo; (Porter and 
</p>
<p>Ignatius 2011a: 4:31). Business strategists just need to find those opportunities to 
</p>
<p>respond to social needs that enhance the competitive advantage of their firms.</p>

</p>
<p>The thesis of Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s CSV paper is that creating shared value can 
</p>
<p>redeem global capitalism&rsquo;s flagging legitimacy. Porter and Kramer defend CSV&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>plausibility with an extensive set of examples that leaves little doubt that many of 
</p>
<p>the praiseworthy achievements of global capitalism in the recent decade owe to a 
</p>
<p>business formula that, in fact, creates shared value&mdash;benefit to society that enriches 
</p>
<p>business too. This is especially apparent in environmental responsibility initiatives 
</p>
<p>that dramatically improve operational efficiency. These highly impactful transfor-
</p>
<p>mations in a firm&rsquo;s activity system (Porter 1996) run the gamut from mundane 
</p>
<p>improvements such as reducing packaging and shipping weight to the bold such as 
</p>
<p>the redefinition by Nissan and Toyota of their market segment (see Levitt 1960) as 
</p>
<p>low-emissions mobility (Pfitzer et&nbsp;al. 2013: 4).
</p>
<p>Our thesis is that, despite appearances to the contrary in Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>compelling paper, CSV cannot redeem the legitimacy of global business as a stand-
</p>
<p>alone managerial framework. The way Porter and Kramer construct the CSV frame-
</p>
<p>work imposes predictable limitations upon the vision of managers, leaving them 
</p>
<p>flat-footed around societal problems whenever competitive advantage appears 
</p>
<p>unable to motivate engagement.
</p>
<p>The missing piece is a framework to manage the extra-legal normative environment, 
</p>
<p>including soft laws developed by non-state actors to fill regulatory voids with tailor-
</p>
<p>made community standards, such as those generated by the Forest Stewardship Council 
</p>
<p>(Scherer and Palazzo 2007). It is certainly true that in replying to the recent critique of 
</p>
<p>CSV provided by a team of leading business ethicists (Crane et&nbsp;al. 2014), Porter and 
</p>
<p>Kramer clarify that they do endorse a &ldquo;a narrow sense of social responsibility&rdquo; (2014: 
</p>
<p>150) and they (2011) have also assumed that managers comply with &ldquo;ethical stan-
</p>
<p>dards.&rdquo; However, the category of non-legal norms&mdash;for which Porter and Kramer 
</p>
<p>assume compliance&mdash;remains opaque in their account of CSV.&nbsp;Their CSV framework 
</p>
<p>does not provide managers a way to make sense of which norms of conduct fit within 
</p>
<p>a &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; sense of CSR and which do not. This becomes especially problematic in a 
</p>
<p>fast-changing, globally interconnected business environment (Palazzo and Scherer 
</p>
<p>2008) where the normal is for norms to evolve and clash (Scherer et&nbsp;al. 2013).
</p>
<p>In the vacuum left by CSV&rsquo;s silence around soft law, Porter and Kramer do not 
</p>
<p>point to any other framework for identifying or evaluating non-legal social norms 
</p>
<p>that matter to business. We will propose that what CSV requires is a responsibility 
</p>
<p>framework that gives guidance to managers for identifying legitimate norms. This 
</p>
<p>framework could take different forms; we will illustrate our proposal with the 
</p>
<p>framework carved out by the integrative social contracts theory (ISCT) developed 
</p>
<p>by Donaldson and Dunfee (1999). We will also briefly discuss the importance of 
</p>
<p>expanding this framework to manage cases where there is a regulatory void and 
</p>
<p>another conception of responsibility is required (Scherer and Palazzo 2007, 2011; 
</p>
<p>Bower et&nbsp;al. 2011; Donaldson and Schoemaker 2013).
</p>
<p> Why Status Quo Business Has Failed Society
</p>
<p>To appreciate the idea behind CSV, it helps to understand the failings  
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer find in status quo managerial practice. It is these failings that 
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer fault for the present-day crisis in the legitimacy of business.

</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer formulate their attack around two ideas in management, which 
</p>
<p>we discuss in turn. The first is what business ethicists call the &ldquo;separation thesis&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Harris and Freeman 2008), the idea that business and society represent separate 
</p>
<p>spheres of human activity. The second is what is widely known as corporate social 
</p>
<p>responsibility (CSR).
</p>
<p>Rejecting the Separation Thesis Michael Porter has never celebrated share value 
</p>
<p>as the end of business activity (Argyres and McGahan 2002). Yet business (if not 
</p>
<p>also society) has done so for decades (Friedman 1970; Jensen 2002), supporting a 
</p>
<p>financial conception of management that fixates on share price (often short term) 
</p>
<p>as the measure of success and failure (Dobbin and Jung 2010). This financial view 
</p>
<p>of the firm throws society out of view in managers&rsquo; evaluation of business oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity (Friedman 1962, 1970). Porter and Kramer put the burden of responsibility 
</p>
<p>for this mistaken view of business on the &ldquo;economists [who] have legitimized the 
</p>
<p>idea that to provide societal benefits, companies must temper their economic suc-
</p>
<p>cess&rdquo; (Porter and Kramer 2011: 64). The costs, however, are not merely academic. 
</p>
<p>According to Porter and Kramer, the influence of the separation thesis on manag-
</p>
<p>ers has contributed to the size of the legitimacy deficit prevailing in business 
</p>
<p>today.
</p>
<p>The intuition behind Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s judgment that the economist&rsquo;s separa-
</p>
<p>tion thesis has been destructive of the legitimacy of business is readily seen with 
</p>
<p>examples. A classic case results when a company can choose to raise production 
</p>
<p>costs by investing in the reduction of destructive emissions for which no binding 
</p>
<p>regulation exists (Friedman 1970). According to a narrow, society-ignoring view, 
</p>
<p>the manager has no basis to even think of investing in emissions reductions. This 
</p>
<p>suggests one way to interpret the managerial factors behind environmental acci-
</p>
<p>dents like the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Why would you ever go beyond a 
</p>
<p>strict reading of the regulations?
</p>
<p>Consider the different case of consumers whose health suffers on account of a 
</p>
<p>product expressly marketed to them. This externality has a ripple effect for the pub-
</p>
<p>lic fisc that has to tend to these consumers&rsquo; health. Now suppose society-ignoring 
</p>
<p>managers at global food companies. Their imperative is to design products likely to 
</p>
<p>increase revenue, by increasing units sold and/or raising price, and decreasing cost. 
</p>
<p>One strategy pursued by the global brands is to engineer the food product to trigger 
</p>
<p>repetitive consumption (Moss 2013). Now suppose that the success of this strategy 
</p>
<p>leads to abnormally high health expenses for a non-trivial set of its consumers, such 
</p>
<p>as the 8.3% of the United States population who have diabetes. This would not be 
</p>
<p>too surprising if the health of the food company&rsquo;s consumers did not directly figure 
</p>
<p>into these companies&rsquo; managers&rsquo; decision frameworks.
</p>
<p>CSV is Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s way of correcting the economists&rsquo; mistaken separa-
</p>
<p>tion thesis and the destructive conduct it condones. Society does not fall out of view 
</p>
<p>in CSV as under the separation thesis. To the contrary, CSV brings to the manager&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>attention the potential to find competitive advantage in serving society&rsquo;s needs.
</p>
<p>Rejecting CSR The separation thesis yields externalities (wherever governments 
</p>
<p>have not directly blocked the way), and these externalities yield social movements 
</p>
<p>for CSR&mdash;Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s (2011) second target. Responding to the toll of the

</p>
<p>separation thesis in management, civil society&mdash;in some cases with the backing of 
</p>
<p>academic research&mdash;has stepped up calls for companies to moderate their economic 
</p>
<p>activity with social responsibility. This critical movement has demanded that com-
</p>
<p>panies treat the social and ecological externalities that result from their activities as 
</p>
<p>falling within the business&rsquo;s mandate. With the advent of social media, the need of 
</p>
<p>companies to respond to petition campaigns&mdash;one way or another&mdash;has only further 
</p>
<p>become a fact of corporate life.
</p>
<p>Any reasonable definition of CSR comprehends the variety of ways&mdash;from philan-
</p>
<p>thropy to compliance with non-legal norms to norm-making activity (Scherer and 
</p>
<p>Palazzo 2007)&mdash;in which companies respond to social demands without the force of 
</p>
<p>law (Schwartz and Carroll 2003). CSR troubles Porter and Kramer in the way they 
</p>
<p>understand it has been pursued. Their concern is easily stated. They see CSR as occu-
</p>
<p>pying a managerial space that is &ldquo;separate from profit maximization&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;76) and instills 
</p>
<p>an agenda that &ldquo;is determined by external reporting and personal preferences,&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;76) 
</p>
<p>rather than independently by the firm pursuant to the aspiration to maximize profit.
</p>
<p>CSV, in contrast, is defined by Porter and Kramer to avoid CSR&rsquo;s limitations by 
</p>
<p>occupying a managerial space the entirety of which is &ldquo;integral to profit maximiza-
</p>
<p>tion&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;76). And Porter and Kramer indicate that rather than taking direction from 
</p>
<p>external norms like CSR, CSV &ldquo;is company specific and internally generated.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Interestingly, in an earlier paper (2006), Porter and Kramer describe their theory 
</p>
<p>within the CSR construct rather than outside it, summarizing their view as follows:
</p>
<p>The essential test that should guide CSR is not whether a cause is worthy but 
</p>
<p>whether it presents an opportunity to create shared value&nbsp;&ndash; that is, a meaningful 
</p>
<p>benefit for society that is also valuable to the business (p.&nbsp;84).
</p>
<p>Note that even when they espoused the CSR label for CSV, the fundamental idea 
</p>
<p>was exactly the same: managers should not be making profitability trade-offs for the 
</p>
<p>sake of CSR.&nbsp;The difference now is that Porter and Kramer (2011) call for managers 
</p>
<p>to discard the CSR construct altogether and instead adopt CSV.
</p>
<p>Note that Porter and Kramer nevertheless endorse compliance with ethical stan-
</p>
<p>dards (2011) and have recently indicated that they are in favor of a &ldquo;narrow sense of 
</p>
<p>social responsibility&rdquo; (2014). But how is a manager to sort out from the sea of infor-
</p>
<p>mation in the business environment the purported norms Porter and Kramer assume 
</p>
<p>they should follow (as ethical standards or as narrow social responsibility impera-
</p>
<p>tives)? Notice that norms that promise competitive advantage as the reward of com-
</p>
<p>pliance fall out from this analysis. Managers should follow those norms from first 
</p>
<p>principles (profitability). But what about the set of ethical standards and social 
</p>
<p>responsibility imperatives that do not promise enhanced profitability as a reward? 
</p>
<p>How can managers separate the wheat from the chaff, the legitimate norms that com-
</p>
<p>mand the manager&rsquo;s respect from other social demands (like the CSR that Porter and 
</p>
<p>Kramer discredit) that should be regarded as threats to profitability and avoided?
</p>
<p>What makes CSV so special, as we will discuss next, is that by definition the 
</p>
<p>CSV framework is built for no trade-offs. The manager never has to choose between 
</p>
<p>profitability and social benefit within the CSV framework.

</p>
<p> The Virtue of&nbsp;CSV in&nbsp;A-Cases
</p>
<p>Status quo managerial practice is, in Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s account, like Dr. Jekyll or 
</p>
<p>Frankenstein: either the misguided, short-term obsession with share value (Dr. 
</p>
<p>Jekyll), or the abomination of free enterprise represented by CSR (Frankenstein). 
</p>
<p>The alternative to this schizophrenia put forth by Porter and Kramer requires com-
</p>
<p>panies to trade up from share value to shared value as their end, and from CSR to 
</p>
<p>CSV as their social strategy. &ldquo;The purpose of the corporation must be redefined as 
</p>
<p>creating shared value, not just profit per se&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;64). As expressed by Mark Pfitzer, a 
</p>
<p>managing director of FSG, a CSV-specialized consultancy formed by Porter and 
</p>
<p>Kramer: &ldquo;Leaders of companies that are making significant progress in building 
</p>
<p>large-scale social enterprises consider solving major social problems in profitable 
</p>
<p>ways to be a, if not the, raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre. [&hellip;] Creating shared value entails embedding 
</p>
<p>a social mission in the corporate culture and channeling resources to the develop-
</p>
<p>ment of innovations that can help solve social problems. In some cases, this is a 
</p>
<p>matter of reemphasizing a firm&rsquo;s founding social mission (Pfitzer et&nbsp;al. 2013: 4).
</p>
<p>By implementing such a corporate purpose, managers&rsquo; strategic imagination is 
</p>
<p>drawn by the CSV framework to search for business opportunity within societal chal-
</p>
<p>lenges. That part is clear and developed further in this section. Whether CSV can also, 
</p>
<p>as Porter and Kramer claim, provide &ldquo;an overall, strategic view of how to think about 
</p>
<p>the role of the corporation in society&rdquo; (Porter and Kramer 2014: 149), is the question 
</p>
<p>taken up in the next section. The task now is to understand the virtue of CSV.
</p>
<p>By deemphasizing quarterly numbers in the way CSV demands, managers gain 
</p>
<p>the space to focus on profitability built upon durable competitive advantage. Porter 
</p>
<p>and Kramer&rsquo;s contribution with CSV is to inspire managers to reach for imaginative 
</p>
<p>ways to provide society value and their firm profitability. Porter is convinced that 
</p>
<p>the sustainably profitable business strategies of the future will achieve competitive 
</p>
<p>advantage by creating shared value, not by profiting at society&rsquo;s expense (Porter and 
</p>
<p>Ignatius 2011b).
</p>
<p>As a construct that defines a framework for strategic decision making, shared 
</p>
<p>value stands for business strategies that strike two targets at once: profitability and 
</p>
<p>societal value. It is this duality in shared value that grounds Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>claim that CSV can realign society and business to revitalize capitalism with legiti-
</p>
<p>macy. According to Porter and Kramer, the world is full of societal needs that are not 
</p>
<p>yet, but could be, fulfilled by companies, and forward-looking shared value strategies 
</p>
<p>promise the potential for a healing of society that deservedly gives credit to business. 
</p>
<p>For this reason, Porter and Kramer contend that shared value holds the key to unlock-
</p>
<p>ing the next wave of business innovation and growth. It will, they believe, also recon-
</p>
<p>nect company success and community success after the age of the separation thesis, 
</p>
<p>short-term thinking, and deepening divides among society&rsquo;s institutions (p.&nbsp;77).
</p>
<p>CSV has met with favor in the corporate world, partly due to FSG&rsquo;s growing 
</p>
<p>track record. Nestle is one high profile early adopter among many, including Mattell, 
</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Shell Oil and Swiss Re. The frame-
</p>
<p>work&rsquo;s practical success surely has to do, not only with Porter&rsquo;s fame and track 
</p>
<p>record (Barney 2002), but with the dozens of concrete examples Porter and Kramer 
</p>

<p/>

</p>
<p>provide to stimulate managerial creativity and point the way forward to successful 
</p>
<p>social engagement (for a review of recent examples, see Pfitzer et&nbsp;al. 2013 and fsg.
</p>
<p>org). All of these examples, as will become apparent, have in common that they 
</p>
<p>represent cases where the new policy or strategy both improves profitability and 
</p>
<p>provides social reward, as compared with the status quo (Crane et&nbsp;al. 2014: 136). 
</p>
<p>These are win-win for business (at least the focal business) and society, and we will 
</p>
<p>call these A-cases (de los Reyes et al. 2017).
</p>
<p>One can say that in an A-case what is good for the goose (the company&rsquo;s profit-
</p>
<p>ability) is good for the gander (society at large). Here are a few representative exam-
</p>
<p>ples noted by Porter and Kramer.
</p>
<p>Intel and IBM are both devising ways to help utilities harness digital intelligence in order 
to economize on power usage (p.&nbsp;67).
</p>
<p>Wells Fargo has developed a line of products and tools that help customers budget, manage 
credit, and pay down debt (p.&nbsp;67).
</p>
<p>Sales of GE&rsquo;s Ecomagination products reached $18 billion in 2009&mdash;the size of a Fortune 
150 company (p.&nbsp;67).
</p>
<p>Dow Chemical managed to reduce consumption of fresh water at its largest production site 
by one billion gallons&mdash;enough water to supply nearly 40,000 people in the U.S. for a 
year&mdash;resulting in savings of $4 million. The demand for watersaving technology has 
allowed India&rsquo;s Jain Irrigation, a leading global manufacturer of complete drip irrigation 
systems for water conservation, to achieve a 41% compound annual growth rate in revenue 
over the past 5&nbsp;years (p.&nbsp;69&ndash;70).
</p>
<p>The favorable alignment attained by managers in these cases is hardly to be dimin-
</p>
<p>ished. The virtue of CSV is the achievement of praiseworthy imagination and inven-
</p>
<p>tiveness attuned to the possibilities presented by societal need. We stand 
</p>
<p>wholeheartedly behind the push for creativity to find win-win opportunities.
</p>
<p>The logic behind this virtue is elucidated in an earlier article&mdash;Porter&rsquo;s break-
</p>
<p>through social issues piece&mdash;dealing with environmental strategy and regulation. 
</p>
<p>Arguing for the same formula of win-win strategies, Porter with van der Linde anal-
</p>
<p>ogizes to the quality revolution of the 1980s. &ldquo;Today we have little trouble grasping 
</p>
<p>the idea that innovation can improve quality while actually lowering cost. But as 
</p>
<p>recently as 15&nbsp;years ago, managers believed there was a fixed &lsquo;trade off&rsquo;&rdquo; (Porter 
</p>
<p>and van der Linde 1995: 122). CSV directs managers to pursue environmentally 
</p>
<p>sound strategies, not only if managers personally want to avoid degradation of the 
</p>
<p>planet, but rather to achieve the advantage of cost savings, improved quality or effi-
</p>
<p>ciency and/or higher prices. Managers, in other words, can and should act in socially 
</p>
<p>attractive ways, finding profitable ways to do so. With CSV, it is not from the envi-
</p>
<p>ronmentalism of managers that we expect green and social strategies, but from their 
</p>
<p>regard to their firm&rsquo;s shared value.
</p>
<p>The social virtue of imaginative CSV strategies, we believe, is beyond doubt and 
</p>
<p>amply borne out by Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s many examples. For this reason, we agree 
</p>
<p>that Porter and Kramer have framed CSV as an essential component of a twenty- 
</p>
<p>first century managerial framework. We will now proceed to lay the foundation for 
</p>
<p>G. de&nbsp;los&nbsp;Reyes Jr. and M. Scholz</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>our contention that being necessary does not make CSV sufficient. Contrary to 
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer, we argue that CSV, on its own, does not provide &ldquo;an overall, 
</p>
<p>strategic view of how to think about the role of the corporation in society&rdquo; (Porter 
</p>
<p>and Kramer 2014: 149). Certainly, Porter and Kramer would grant that CSV must 
</p>
<p>fit alongside the normativity of law; fortunately, managers do not need a managerial 
</p>
<p>framework to help them identify binding law (lawyers can manage that). Porter and 
</p>
<p>Kramer also endorse compliance with ethical standards and a narrow sense of social 
</p>
<p>responsibility. This category of norms is not self-legitimating in the way the law can 
</p>
<p>be (Hart 1961). Managers have to make judgments about the legitimacy of those 
</p>
<p>norms that call for compliance, and the limitation with CSV, as we shall see, is that 
</p>
<p>it does not have a way to specify how and when non-legal norms acquire legitimacy 
</p>
<p>in managerial decision making.
</p>
<p> CSV Beyond the&nbsp;A-Case
</p>
<p>In this section, we motivate our contention that CSV does not provide a compre-
</p>
<p>hensive managerial framework, one that can plausibly promise to restore business 
</p>
<p>legitimacy as Porter and Kramer project. The guidance of CSV around A-cases 
</p>
<p>has virtue. CSV directs the manager to search for A-cases by exploring society&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>needs. Unfortunately, as Porter and Kramer acknowledge, &ldquo;NOT ALL societal 
</p>
<p>problems can be solved through shared value solutions&rdquo; (emphasis in the original) 
</p>
<p>(Porter and Kramer 2011: 77). And those societal problems that fall within CSV&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>blind spot are not necessarily exceptional or immaterial, but rather many are pre-
</p>
<p>dictable and often serious. What falls into this blind spot are all those cases that 
</p>
<p>are not win-win for business and society and, therefore, do not represent A-cases. 
</p>
<p>These B-cases are either win-lose (like increasing the amount of destructive but 
</p>
<p>unregulated and cost-saving emissions) or lose-win (like CSR initiatives that 
</p>
<p>demand profitability trade-offs) (de los Reyes et al. 2017).
</p>
<p>What defines a B-case context is that managers have not yet identified a win-win 
</p>
<p>strategy at the margin. To the contrary, profitability and social advantage appear at 
</p>
<p>odds, as, for example, in the case of improving labor standards in Bangladeshi tex-
</p>
<p>tile manufacture: the obvious way to interpret the implications of investment in 
</p>
<p>safety improvements by the global brands is as a reduction, rather than as an 
</p>
<p>increase, in profit margins. As presented by Porter and Kramer, there is no obvious 
</p>
<p>shared value in voluntarily reducing margins to raise labor conditions (value is not 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;shared&rdquo; unless the firm gains profitability). CSV&rsquo;s potential for disregarding the 
</p>
<p>labor conditions of supply chain workers abroad is reinforced by Porter and 
</p>
<p>Kramer&rsquo;s criticism of the fair trade movement.
</p>
<p>Fair trade aims to increase the proportion of revenue that goes to poor farmers by 
</p>
<p>paying them higher prices for the same crops. Though this may be a noble senti-
</p>
<p>ment, fair trade is mostly about redistribution rather than expanding the overall 
</p>
<p>amount of value created.
</p>
<p>Framed in this manner, CSV would also seem to disfavor (or at least not encour-
</p>
<p>age) investing in labor standards: it is not obviously the case that by investing profits

</p>
<p>in labor standards the global clothing brands would increase &ldquo;the overall amount of 
</p>
<p>value created.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In addition to those emerging from working conditions, supply chain manage-
</p>
<p>ment can run up against a number of other B-case issues, including potential reli-
</p>
<p>ance upon child or forced labor and the violation (or complicity in the violation) of 
</p>
<p>human rights. B-case issues also often result when marketing abroad in different 
</p>
<p>normative regimes. Yahoo entered the Chinese market to offer search and other 
</p>
<p>web-based services to the world&rsquo;s most populous country in the late 1990s (Dann 
</p>
<p>and Haddow 2008). Yahoo later found itself under orders from the Chinese govern-
</p>
<p>ment to turn over the email addresses of two Chinese journalists. Should it comply 
</p>
<p>or not? Complying would have a negative impact on the journalists and would chill 
</p>
<p>anything approach freedom of the press in China. This is a difficult question, and 
</p>
<p>CSV does not help with an answer.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the decision to act affirmatively about improving labor conditions 
</p>
<p>abroad must seemingly come from a different normative principle than 
</p>
<p>CSV.&nbsp;Porter and Kramer recognize ethical standards and a narrow sense of social 
</p>
<p>responsibility, and this realm is implicated by B-cases. Porter and Kramer have 
</p>
<p>not specified how managers are to assess the legitimacy of these norms, and CSV 
</p>
<p>does not provide any guidance either. Are the global brands morally responsible, 
</p>
<p>in Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s view, for harms to Bangladeshi textile workers who died 
</p>
<p>in the Rana Plaza building crash (caused by corruption and recklessness that led 
</p>
<p>to over 1000 worker deaths)? Was there a reprehensible managerial failing that 
</p>
<p>gave rise to a global brand&rsquo;s labor strategy? Would voluntarily reducing the profit 
</p>
<p>margin to improve the working conditions in textile factories fall within the nar-
</p>
<p>row sense of social responsibility Porter and Kramer endorse? These are chal-
</p>
<p>lenging questions, and the CSV framework, as Porter and Kramer present it, has 
</p>
<p>no comment.
</p>
<p>The last question asked in the previous paragraph raises an additional difficulty 
</p>
<p>with Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s account and its handling of B-cases. The difficulty was 
</p>
<p>suggested by the discussion of fair trade above: Porter and Kramer dismiss the legit-
</p>
<p>imacy of economic redistribution. Shared value, they emphasize, is not &ldquo;about 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;sharing&rsquo; the value already created by firms&mdash;a redistribution approach&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;65). To 
</p>
<p>return to the case of Bangladeshi textiles, it is difficult to see the absence of redistri-
</p>
<p>bution when global brands assume and pay for voluntary compliance with norms 
</p>
<p>that reduce profit margins so as to improve labor conditions. Does that, in Porter and 
</p>
<p>Kramer&rsquo;s view, disqualify the norm of investing in supply chain labor conditions to 
</p>
<p>a certain standard from achieving legitimacy as an ethical standard or within a nar-
</p>
<p>row sense of social responsibility?
</p>
<p>In sum, for several related reasons, Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s account of CSV would 
</p>
<p>leave global brands managers flat-footed about B-cases like where there is no eco-
</p>
<p>nomic reason to invest to improve labor conditions in the supply chain. The limita-
</p>
<p>tion with Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s account of CSV, we have argued, is that B-cases are 
</p>
<p>typical enough to cast doubt on the potential of this framework to single-handedly 
</p>
<p>restore the legitimacy of capitalism. The societal downside of B-cases where busi-
</p>
<p>ness is pursuing opportunities to society&rsquo;s detriment (like polluting)&mdash;or is failing to 
</p>
<p>G. de&nbsp;los&nbsp;Reyes Jr. and M. Scholz</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>355
</p>
<p>pursue social enterprise for want of competitive advantage (like healthier food that 
</p>
<p>not enough consumers will pay more for)&mdash;stands in the way of the legitimacy of 
</p>
<p>business, as conceptualized by Porter and Kramer and, with greater complexity, in 
</p>
<p>the management literature (Suchman 1995; Scherer et&nbsp;al. 2013).
</p>
<p>A team of leading business ethicists, in their recent review of CSV, go even fur-
</p>
<p>ther and suggest that with its emphasis on A-cases CSV not only obscures harms 
</p>
<p>that result from business activity but could also induce companies to celebrate 
</p>
<p>A-cases (or apparent A-cases) for marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>Operating with a CSV mindset, corporations might tend to invest more resources 
</p>
<p>in promoting the impression that complex problems have been transformed in to 
</p>
<p>win-win situations for all affected parties, while in reality problems of systemic 
</p>
<p>injustice have not been solved and the poverty of marginalized stakeholders might 
</p>
<p>even have increased because of the engagement of the corporation &hellip; [I]nstead of 
</p>
<p>promoting the common good, CSV might promote more sophisticated strategies of 
</p>
<p>greenwashing (Crane et&nbsp;al. 2014: 137).
</p>
<p>Moreover, these business ethicists correctly, we think, point out that CSV&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>methodology for identifying A-cases ignores the question whether the underlying 
</p>
<p>product offers genuine social good. A tobacco company, for example, might reduce 
</p>
<p>the water used in production, and that measure, seen as a discrete strategy, is socially 
</p>
<p>positive. No matter how much water is saved making cigarettes, this A-case cannot 
</p>
<p>change the fact that tobacco causes serious health risks.
</p>
<p> Supplementing CSV with&nbsp;a&nbsp;Responsibility Framework
</p>
<p>In this section, we address the challenge of supplementing CSV with a responsibil-
</p>
<p>ity framework, of one kind or another. What we are interested in showing is how two 
</p>
<p>managerial frameworks&mdash;CSV and a responsibility framework&mdash;may be combined 
</p>
<p>to provide a more comprehensive framework, one that fills the B-case gap in CSV 
</p>
<p>with a norm-identifying apparatus.
</p>
<p>A prominent candidate in business ethics to address these issues is Integrative 
</p>
<p>Social Contracts Theory (ISCT), an approach that has been widely embraced in 
</p>
<p>business ethics and serves as an exemplar of social contracts theory in management 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Van Oosterhout et&nbsp;al. 2006; Gilbert and Benham 2009). Social contract theory 
</p>
<p>originated in political philosophy over 300&nbsp;years ago when philosophers such as 
</p>
<p>Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau sought to justify the existence of the state and to bet-
</p>
<p>ter understand the reciprocal obligations of the state and citizen. Applied to business 
</p>
<p>and society, the idea of the social contract as a theory of moral philosophy attempts 
</p>
<p>to understand the terms under which the members of society consent to the legiti-
</p>
<p>macy of a business system involving markets, organizations and other economic 
</p>
<p>communities (Dunfee et&nbsp;al. 1999).
</p>
<p>Developed by Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee, ISCT transforms the 
</p>
<p>idea of social contracts (e.g., Rousseau 1762; Rawls 1971) into a concrete manage-
</p>
<p>rial framework. The framework posits two layers of norms, beyond which managers 
</p>
<p>enjoy &ldquo;moral free space.&rdquo; The top layer consists of &ldquo;hypernorms,&rdquo; norms with 
</p>
<p>17 Response to&nbsp;Porter: Responsibility for&nbsp;Realising the&nbsp;Promise of&nbsp;Shared Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>356
</p>
<p>universal reach that are deeply embedded in human society transculturally, identifi-
</p>
<p>able by their common embrace around the world in the leading religious, political 
</p>
<p>and philosophical traditions (1999: 49&ndash;81). Other more local norms emerge from 
</p>
<p>the microsocial contracts that result from joint participation in business activity by 
</p>
<p>members of a given economic community, such as employees in a corporation or 
</p>
<p>traders in a given marketplace (1999: 83&ndash;116). These microsocial norms are bind-
</p>
<p>ing under ISCT so long as four conditions are met. The first is that the norms be (1) 
</p>
<p>well established, meaning they are dominant in a community that gives members a 
</p>
<p>meaningful (2) right of exit, i.e., that they are in a meaningful way voluntary with 
</p>
<p>respect to the bound party, and (3) right of voice to weigh in on and influence the 
</p>
<p>community&rsquo;s norms. These conditions ensure that microsocial norms only bind 
</p>
<p>when it can be said that the actor in question chose to be subject to the norms. 
</p>
<p>Finally, microsocial norms do not bind&mdash;even if the first three conditions are met&mdash;
</p>
<p>if they are not consistent with hypernorms, like human rights.
</p>
<p>The theory of ISCT generates a framework by prompting thought experiments to 
</p>
<p>help identify applicable hypernorms and microsocial contracts (e.g., 1999: 63&ndash;73; 
</p>
<p>102&ndash;112). The resulting norms identified by a manager are deemed legitimately 
</p>
<p>binding under the theory (e.g., Donaldson 1996; Donaldson and Dunfee 1999, 2002; 
</p>
<p>Dunfee et&nbsp;al. 1999; Dunfee 2006). In realms where managers cannot identify bind-
</p>
<p>ing norms through the ISCT framework, Donaldson and Dunfee think they enjoy 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;moral free space&rdquo; meaning they &ldquo;have substantial discretion in deciding how to 
</p>
<p>respond to stakeholder claims and interests&rdquo; (1999: 253).
</p>
<p>How could CSV and ISCT fit together? Where the manager identifies moral free 
</p>
<p>space, CSV&rsquo;s imperatives can operate without restriction, meaning that managers 
</p>
<p>can focus on creating shared value. Outside moral free space, managers and their 
</p>
<p>companies are subject any hypernorms and microsocial norms identified by apply-
</p>
<p>ing the framework, meaning that they can pursue the creation of shared value sub-
</p>
<p>ject to binding norms. The conjunction of ISCT with CSV means that managers 
</p>
<p>have a decision apparatus for identifying when a norm binds them in a way that 
</p>
<p>overrides CSV.&nbsp;In this way, ISCT provides a plausible managerial framework to fill 
</p>
<p>the gap in CSV with clear rules of engagement: in moral free space, CSV reigns 
</p>
<p>untrammeled, whereas hypernorms and microsocial contracts, where applicable, 
</p>
<p>trump CSV.&nbsp;As Donaldson recently noted in a review of CSV:
</p>
<p>A company should tell the truth to investors, refuse to discriminate on the basis of race or 
gender and refrain from dumping cancer-causing chemicals in public waters, even when 
doing so fails to enhance its competitive posture. It should do so even when the regulatory 
apparatus in a developing country is inadequate to regulate pollution; and it should do so 
even in a developed country when industry insider knowledge exceeds regulatory reach, as 
when bankers know their complex toxic mortgage derivatives are opaque to regulators. 
The logic of the language of morals is often not about optimisation, but commitment 
(Donaldson 2014).
</p>
<p>The manager who follows a managerial framework consisting of CSV plus ISCT, 
</p>
<p>therefore, finds guidance around B-cases, rather than the silence of CSV.

</p>
<p>Consider the case of forestry, and the many issues it raises. Does it matter whether 
</p>
<p>harvested forests are depleted? Do managers need to worry about other environ-
</p>
<p>mental impacts? What about the status of indigenous peoples who spend their lives 
</p>
<p>in forests that could be legally harvested? What norms should a manager committed 
</p>
<p>to a narrow sense of social responsibility follow? According to ISCT, managers 
</p>
<p>should scan the environment for applicable microsocial norms and hypernorms. 
</p>
<p>There are potential human rights concerns in loss of habitat of indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>and there are likely other relevant hypernorms as well. One of the virtues of micro-
</p>
<p>social norms is often to bring concrete content to deep-tissue moral principles like 
</p>
<p>human rights. In the forestry space, this advantage has been realized, however 
</p>
<p>imperfectly, through a series of voluntary certification schemes, of which the 
</p>
<p>Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC), founded in 1993, was first and remains the 
</p>
<p>standard bearer. FSC resulted from a multi-stakeholder initiative&mdash;forestry compa-
</p>
<p>nies, environmental NGOs and forest certification organizations (as discussed in the 
</p>
<p>following section, a prototypical case of norm-making). FSC has established and 
</p>
<p>maintained up to date a set of ten principles and detailed criteria for the industry to 
</p>
<p>follow. The twist is that FSC does not enforce these principles as if they were law. 
</p>
<p>FSC provides a certification that can be enjoyed by forest owners that act according 
</p>
<p>to the FSC Principles&mdash;ensuring the right of exit ISCT demands. Today, the ques-
</p>
<p>tion for companies in the industry is whether to comply with the FSC&rsquo;s (or another 
</p>
<p>norm-making organization&rsquo;s) certification standards (a matter of norm-taking).
</p>
<p>The following commitments, adopted by FSC members, address the questions 
</p>
<p>raised above:
</p>
<p>To maintain or restore the ecosystem, its biodiversity, resources, landscapes;
</p>
<p>To identify and uphold indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights of ownership and use of land 
</p>
<p>and resources.
</p>
<p>In this case, there is not at all a blank slate for managers of the forestry company 
</p>
<p>to do what appears to be in the best interest of the company, without considering 
</p>
<p>societal needs and impacts. There are carefully developed and well-established FSC 
</p>
<p>norms that speak to the precise issues that face forestry companies. According to 
</p>
<p>ISCT, these norms are legitimate and binding since they result from voluntary par-
</p>
<p>ticipation that allows for voice and exit. The nature of the FSC process makes for a 
</p>
<p>compelling case that the legitimacy of a forestry company calls for its managers to 
</p>
<p>meet or beat FSC certification standards.
</p>
<p>Coupling CSV with ISCT, as the norm-taking framework in CSV+ requires the 
</p>
<p>two frameworks to integrate, and they do so in the following, straightforward way: 
</p>
<p>Where the manager is in moral free space, i.e., there are no well-established micro-
</p>
<p>social norms or hypernorms to bind, CSV&rsquo;s own imperatives would operate without 
</p>
<p>impediment. Outside moral free space, managers and their companies are subject to 
</p>
<p>any hypernorms and legitimate microsocial norms identified by applying the frame-
</p>
<p>work. By coupling ISCT, managers can go after CSV and yet be oriented to heed 
</p>
<p>legitimate norms on the way there. In this manner, ISCT provides a managerial 
</p>
<p>framework designed to help fill the gap in CSV and make good on Porter and 
</p>
<p>17 Response to&nbsp;Porter: Responsibility for&nbsp;Realising the&nbsp;Promise of&nbsp;Shared Value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>358
</p>
<p>Kramer&rsquo;s injunction to comply with ethical norms. The decision tree is clear: in 
</p>
<p>moral free space, CSV reigns untrammeled, whereas legitimate norms, where appli-
</p>
<p>cable and well established, delimit the pursuit of CSV.
</p>
<p>We close this section by noting the importance of a responsibility framework 
</p>
<p>geared to deal with cases where the existing normative landscape is not reasonably 
</p>
<p>up to the demands of business practice and its societal impacts. In these cases, 
</p>
<p>where prevailing norms appear to be absent, too general, obsolete or otherwise mal-
</p>
<p>adapted to the matter at hand (Scherer and Palazzo 2011; Bower et&nbsp; al. 2011; 
</p>
<p>Donaldson and Schoemaker 2013), a framework like ISCT loses plausibility 
</p>
<p>(Scherer and Palazzo 2007: 1101&ndash;1102). Donaldson has recently supplemented 
</p>
<p>ISCT with a framework designed to address cases like these with a managerial 
</p>
<p>imperative to engage in norm-marking industry initiatives (Donaldson and 
</p>
<p>Schoemaker 2013). Specifically, Donaldson and Schoemaker argue that the respon-
</p>
<p>sibilities of a captain of industry activate a legitimate norm that binds these execu-
</p>
<p>tives as custodians of an industry&rsquo;s good health and survival, safeguarding for 
</p>
<p>society the welfare the industry should provide. Scherer and Palazzo, in part based 
</p>
<p>on their critique of ISCT&rsquo;s limitations, also call for executives to engage in norm- 
</p>
<p>making deliberation, calling this activity &ldquo;political CSR.&rdquo; Writing from a tradition 
</p>
<p>closer in lineage to Porter, Bower, Paine and Leonard of the Harvard Business 
</p>
<p>School (2011: 154) frame the imperative to engage in norm-making discourse as 
</p>
<p>institutional activism: &ldquo;success in addressing the challenges we have identified [as 
</p>
<p>facing capitalism] will also require innovation in institutional arrangements in the 
</p>
<p>external environment within which firms operate&rdquo; (emphasis in the original).
</p>
<p>A framework for norm-making along the lines suggested by these three different 
</p>
<p>approaches picks up where a norm-identifying and prescribing framework like 
</p>
<p>ISCT leaves off. Re-consider the example of the Bangladesh apparel industry. In the 
</p>
<p>aftermath of the April 2013 Rana Plaza disaster, leaders in the global apparel indus-
</p>
<p>try faced a major threat to the industry&rsquo;s moral legitimacy. The trail led to the global 
</p>
<p>brands&rsquo; supply chain practices and their failure to monitor their suppliers and pro-
</p>
<p>mote safety for workers (Quelch and Rodriguez 2013). The global brands had failed 
</p>
<p>to engage in norm-making in time to prevent the Rana Plaza tragedy. Nevertheless, 
</p>
<p>immediately following the tragedy, numerous brands responded to the crisis with 
</p>
<p>collaborative norm-making processes.
</p>
<p>Two different approaches emerged, one organized by European companies, the 
</p>
<p>Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (the Accord) (Accord 2015); the 
</p>
<p>other by US firms (notably, Walmart and The Gap), the Alliance for Bangladesh 
</p>
<p>Worker Safety (the Alliance) (Alliance 2015). Both issued norms applicable to their 
</p>
<p>members that address labor conditions, concerning safety especially. The norms 
</p>
<p>that emerged from these two microsocial communities are not, however, identical. 
</p>
<p>A noteworthy difference is that joining the Alliance is not supposed to subject the 
</p>
<p>member to legal risk, whereas under the Accord the member may be exposed to 
</p>
<p>certain obligations that create the potential for legal liability. Which set of norms 
</p>
<p>will work better to protect worker safety is an evolving question of fact.
</p>
<p>We recognize the importance of saying much more about the interface between 
</p>
<p>a norm-taking framework and a norm-making framework than we can here. In this

</p>
<p>section, our limited aim has been to ground the plausibility of layering CSV with a 
</p>
<p>compound responsibility framework of the sort we sketched (ISCT plus a call to 
</p>
<p>norm-making where existing norms fall short). The purpose of such an elaboration 
</p>
<p>of Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s CSV framework has been to support our view that CSV&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>limitations do not provide a reason to reject the framework, but rather provide a 
</p>
<p>reason to supplement the framework in the manner suggested in this section.
</p>
<p> Conclusion
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we have sought to develop the intuition behind Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>powerful CSV framework, demonstrating how it answers the limitations with a 
</p>
<p>society-ignoring obsession with share value. The virtue of CSV is bringing societal 
</p>
<p>needs into the heart of strategy, as the primary ground for developing sustainable 
</p>
<p>competitive advantage. In light of this virtue, Porter and Kramer conclude that 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;learning how to create shared value is our best chance to legitimize business again&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(64). We have argued that as a freestanding managerial framework CSV is not a 
</p>
<p>plausible antidote to business&rsquo;s legitimacy crisis. In our view, Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>claim requires at least one more word: learning how to create shared value respon-
</p>
<p>sibly is our best chance to legitimize business again.
</p>
<p>What CSV therefore needs, in our view, is a managerial framework to operation-
</p>
<p>alize the meaning of responsibility. While Porter and Kramer endorse the general 
</p>
<p>legitimacy of ethical standards and a narrow sense of social responsibility, they do 
</p>
<p>not articulate a responsibility framework to assist the manager in separating the 
</p>
<p>wheat (legitimate and binding norms) from the chaff (norms that do not legitimately 
</p>
<p>bind managers). To show how to supplement CSV with a responsibility framework, 
</p>
<p>we drew upon ISCT.&nbsp;The plausibility of ISCT for our purposes owes to the way it 
</p>
<p>yields a managerial framework geared to facilitate the identification of the legiti-
</p>
<p>mate non-legal norms that bind managers. Even ISCT, we have suggested, has its 
</p>
<p>limitations whenever business activity has outstripped normative development in 
</p>
<p>civil society, and we highlight the importance of norm-making as a feature of a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive responsibility framework.
</p>
<p>The corporate managers who we think can do the most to help restore the legiti-
</p>
<p>macy of capitalism will have to be devoted to CSV, turning over every stone of 
</p>
<p>societal need to find opportunities to extend their firm&rsquo;s competitive advantage. 
</p>
<p>They will also, we add, listen very carefully, not only to the hard law of legislators 
</p>
<p>and regulators, but also to wide range of players in civil society who have a voice in 
</p>
<p>the articulation of norms, from soft law to best practices. These norms&mdash;contested 
</p>
<p>though they may be&mdash;arise to channel business activity with the grain of societal 
</p>
<p>interest, and the twenty-first century manager cannot disregard the guidance these 
</p>
<p>norms may legitimately provide. What managers need is a framework, such as ISCT 
</p>
<p>models, that can help them figure out when norms bind and also when norms are 
</p>
<p>lacking, requiring managers to become public deliberators engaged in norm-making 
</p>
<p>processes. Only managers so equipped with a compound framework&mdash;CSV plus an

</p>
<p>adequate responsibility framework&mdash;can hold the promise for a renewal of capital-
</p>
<p>ism in the century ahead.

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>The crisis that hit the coffee market after the International Coffee Organization 
</p>
<p>(ICO) agreement collapsed in 1989 led Italian company illycaff&egrave; to look beyond the 
</p>
<p>typical business model that had characterized the coffee industry to date. illycaff&egrave; 
</p>
<p>decided to embrace a new strategic challenge and focus on a direct-purchasing 
</p>
<p>model. They would bypass the intermediaries and reward their chosen growers by 
</p>
<p>paying them a premium over the market price.
</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Brazil was the world&rsquo;s largest producer of coffee, but had a 
</p>
<p>reputation for low-quality products and poorly paid producers. But illycaff&egrave; prided 
</p>
<p>itself on the high-quality coffee it offered consumers, and so the company had to 
</p>
<p>find a way to overcome the quality problems associated with Brazilian coffee. They 
</p>
<p>had to identify Brazilian coffee producers who were able to supply the high-quality 
</p>
<p>beans the company required. Innovation translated into quality and networking 
</p>
<p>translated into knowledge transfer thus became the drivers behind illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s strat-
</p>
<p>egy, looking for and demanding quality, and teaching producers how to deliver that 
</p>
<p>quality. Ultimately, the company had to build a new kind of relationship with rele-
</p>
<p>vant stakeholders along the supply chain, starting from the cultivation of coffee, 
</p>
<p>continuing through the purchase, and culminating in the roasting, packaging, and 
</p>
<p>selling of high-quality coffee blends.
</p>
<p>Innovation translated into quality and networking translated into knowledge 
</p>
<p>transfer became, in fact, the main drivers of sustainability, enabling illycaff&egrave; to 
</p>
<p>incorporate environmental and social concerns within a strategy of corporate sus-
</p>
<p>tainability (CS). This strategy produced interesting results in Brazil in terms of 
</p>
<p>company growth, but now management had to assess illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s sustainable strategy 
</p>
<p>against the impact of several factors, including the CS strategies of competitors and 
</p>
<p>market reaction in the long-term. They also had to determine whether their own 
</p>
<p>strategy was robust. Was illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s CS strategy really a key differentiator in the cof-
</p>
<p>fee industry supply chain?
</p>
<p> The Coffee Industry
</p>
<p>Since the nineteenth century, the coffee industry has suffered from long periods of 
</p>
<p>oversupply and low prices followed by relatively brief periods of short supply and 
</p>
<p>high prices. The 1990s saw a surge in production that substantially altered the global 
</p>
<p>supply structure, causing the worst coffee crisis ever in terms of growers&rsquo; incomes. 
</p>
<p>A number of factors drove this crisis, including the collapse of the International 
</p>
<p>Coffee Organization (ICO) Agreement in 1989 (see Exhibit 18.1), which led to 
</p>
<p>oversupply; the emergence of cost-efficient new entrants such as Vietnam; produc-
</p>
<p>tivity innovations in Brazil; a lack of technical and financial support for farmers; 
</p>
<p>and tariff and non-tariff barriers imposed by the European Union (EU) trade regime.1

</p>
<p>The poorly paid coffee farmers at the start of the coffee supply chain (see Fig.&nbsp;18.1) 
</p>
<p>showed enormous resilience, and one way or another most managed to survive and 
</p>
<p>continue to produce, but this did not make for sustainable development of the coffee 
</p>
<p>industry.
</p>
<p>Fluctuations in production and market prices for coffee are shown in Exhibit 
</p>
<p>18.2. Between 1980 and 1990, the average production of the main exporting coun-
</p>
<p>tries was 90 million bags (each weighing 60&nbsp;kg), increasing to 112 million bags in 
</p>
<p>the 2000&ndash;2005 period. In 2006, world-wide production of coffee was 124 million 
</p>
<p>bags against a global consumption estimated at 116 million bags in the same year, 
</p>
<p>compared to 115 million bags in 2005. In general, total coffee production exceeded 
</p>
<p>demand for most of the period from 1997 to 2003 (see Exhibit 18.3). Consumption 
</p>
<p>showed an increase in some coffee-importing countries during 2002&ndash;2005, with per 
</p>
<p>capita consumption rising. In 2005, per capita consumption in the EU was 4.71&nbsp;kg, 
</p>
<p>and 4.18&nbsp;kg in the USA.
</p>
<p>Coffee-growing countries exported on average about 75% of their total produc-
</p>
<p>tion during the period 1980&ndash;2005. Domestic consumption in exporting countries in 
</p>
<p>2006 was estimated at 31 million bags (30 million bags in 2005), against a con-
</p>
<p>sumption of around 85 million bags in importing countries in 2006, basically 
</p>
<p>unchanged compared to 85.5 million bags in 2005.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, market prices were falling. From 1980 to 1990, prices averaged 
</p>
<p>US$1.20 per pound, but fell to an average price of US$0.60s per pound, at a CAGR 
</p>
<p>of &minus;22%, for the period between 2000 and 2005.

</p>
<p>Brazil unquestionably produced more coffee than any other country. Having 
</p>
<p> contributed more than 42 million 60&nbsp;kg bags of coffee in the 2006 harvest, Brazil had 
</p>
<p>a market share of 35%, more than one-third of the world&rsquo;s coffee (see Exhibit 18.4).
</p>
<p>The breakdown in the ICO Agreement in 1989 and the economic damage that 
</p>
<p>resulted led to substantial pressure on coffee importers to use their market leverage 
</p>
<p>to alleviate the economic hardships faced by coffee growers and their employees. 
</p>
<p>Leading companies in the coffee industry responded with CS initiatives. At the 
</p>
<p>same time, several organizations were formed to address particular aspects of the 
</p>
<p>situation. The Brazil Speciality Coffee Association (BCSA) dedicated itself to 
</p>
<p>improving the reputation and quality of Brazilian coffee, the Rainforest Alliance 
</p>
<p>focused on sustainable livelihoods, and Utz Kapeh was founded to certify the social 
</p>
<p>and environmental quality of coffee production, identifying responsible coffee pro-
</p>
<p>ducers (for more information on these organizations, see Exhibit 18.5).
</p>
<p>Commenting on the relationship between the coffee industry and sustainable 
</p>
<p>corporate practices, Dr. Decio Zylbersztajn, Professor of Economics of Organization 
</p>
<p>at the University of S&atilde;o Paolo and Coordinator of the PENSA, Agribusiness 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Centre (PENSA, Centro de Conhecimento em Agroneg&ograve;cios), stated:
</p>
<p>Looking at the coffee industry, I have to say that CS is ignored in general. To the supply 
process side of the coffee industry in Brazil, CS is not an issue; most of the companies 
might not even know what we are talking about. They get their supplies to the market in 
formalized transactions that can be accomplished through intermediaries. If you have 
brands, like illycaff&egrave;, you might not have to consider CS as a cost, but as a cost-and-benefit 
issue, as illycaff&egrave; does. You have a market that values CS.&nbsp;CS of course can be an expensive 
strategy, but also, reading the literature, I feel that final consumers recognize the high value 
of those brands that behave responsibly.
</p>
<p> Coffee and&nbsp;Fair Trade
</p>
<p>Coffee was the first product to carry the Fair Trade label promoted by the group Fair 
</p>
<p>Trade Labelling Organizations International (FLO). The idea was born when Frans 
</p>
<p>van der Hof, a Dutch missionary living in Mexico, noticed that coffee growers in 
</p>
<p>Oaxaca were selling their coffee to intermediaries at extremely low prices. A plan 
</p>
<p>was developed with Dutch NGO Solidaridad to help the farmers sell their coffee 
</p>
<p>direct to the market.
</p>
<p>The Fair Trade movement is described by Wikipedia as a &lsquo;market-based approach 
</p>
<p>to alleviating global poverty and promoting sustainability&rsquo;. Fairtrade coffee sales 
</p>
<p>benefit producers both directly and indirectly. In contrast to Codes of Conduct and 
</p>
<p>other social labels, the Fairtrade Standards are not simply a set of minimum stan-
</p>
<p>dards for socially sustainable production and trade. The Fairtrade Standards go far-
</p>
<p>ther: they guarantee a minimum price considered as fair to producers. They provide 
</p>
<p>a Fairtrade Premium that the producer must invest in projects that enhance social, 
</p>
<p>economic, and environmental development. They strive for mutually beneficial 
</p>
<p>long-term trading relationships. They set clear minimum and developmental criteria 
</p>
<p>and objectives for social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Fairtrade 
</p>
<p>F. Perrini and A. Russo</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>367
</p>
<p>Standards must be met by producers, their organizations, and the traders who deal 
</p>
<p>with Fairtrade products (see Exhibit 18.6 for more information).
</p>
<p>Sales of Fairtrade coffee rose by 40% from 2004 to 2005. As of 2007, FLO was 
</p>
<p>working with 248 coffee producers in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
</p>
<p>...Worldwide, sales of Fairtrade-certified coffee have increased from $22.5m per year to 
$87m per year since 1998. This is still only a tiny fraction of the overall world coffee trade, 
worth $10 billion annually. But there are plenty of other niche markets for high-quality cof-
fee. Some small producers can charge more by marketing their coffee as organic&mdash;a switch 
which takes five years or so&mdash;or &lsquo;bird-friendly&rsquo; because, unlike large, mechanised planta-
tions, they have retained shade trees.
</p>
<p>Fair enough. Taking the quality route to survival. The Economist 30 March 2006
</p>
<p>The well-known growth of the Fair Trade movement is only the first step toward sustain-
ability, since the fair trade will continue no matter what the quality of its product. My triple 
concern is, first, that higher prices do not always mean higher value and quality; second, 
that producers looking for ad hoc certifications have to manage higher costs that spread 
throughout the supply chain; third, that sustainability does not always last, so that, in the 
long run, if the fair trade requirements are not met, the market (i.e., producers) might go 
back to the previous business model very quickly.

<p>Andrea Illy, Chairman and CEO, illycaff&egrave;
</p>
<p> The illycaff&egrave; Group
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave; S.p.A. was founded by Francesco Illy in 1933, and was dedicated to pro-
</p>
<p>viding quality coffee. Francesco was succeeded by his son, Ernesto, soon after 
</p>
<p>World War II, and in 1994, Andrea Illy became Chairman and CEO.
</p>
<p>By 2007, illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s distinctive blend of 100% Arabica coffee2 was available in 
</p>
<p>approximately 130 countries worldwide, and was served in over 50,000 public out-
</p>
<p>lets, including 50 espressamente illy coffee bars in Italy and 100 worldwide. The 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s headquarters, including its only roasting, processing, and packaging 
</p>
<p>facility, were located in Trieste, Italy, where shipments of green coffee beans arrived. 
</p>
<p>The illycaff&egrave; group controlled ten companies worldwide dedicated to international 
</p>
<p>distribution, and maintained relationships within a wider network of companies 
</p>
<p>globally (see Fig.&nbsp;18.2). illycaff&egrave; employed over 700 people in 2007, 400 of whom

<p>2 Coffee has its peculiarities, and the kind of bean grown and its location determines the flavour of 
the coffee. Various labels help traders identify the beans used in the coffee, thus assisting them in 
pricing it. There are, about 60 kinds of coffee plant, and each kind comes in several varieties. Of 
these varieties, only 10 are mass-produced throughout the world, the most popular being Arabica 
(Coffea Arabica) and the well-known Robusta coffee (Coffea Canephora). Arabica and Robusta 
coffees are classified, respectively, as the highest quality and most expensive and the lowest quality 
and least expensive coffees sold in the international market. The taste of an Arabica bean from 
Brazil will differ from that of an Arabica bean from Kenya.

<p>illycaff&egrave; ranks among the top performers in the European coffee industry. Among 
</p>
<p>companies in the Processing of Tea and Coffee industry (NACE Rev. 1.1, code 
</p>
<p>1586), illycaff&egrave; had a market share of 2.27% in 2005, ranking it the sixth largest 
</p>
<p>company in terms of turnover in Europe, following larger companies such as 
</p>
<p>Unilever N.V., Sara Lee International B.V., Kraft Foods France, Luigi Lavazza 
</p>
<p>S.p.a., and Kraft Foods Schweiz Ag (see Exhibit 18.7). Turnover for illycaff&egrave; 
</p>
<p>increased from &euro;130 million in 1998 to &euro;228 million in 2005, representing a CAGR 
</p>
<p>of 7% over the 8&nbsp;years (see Exhibits 18.8 and 18.9 for illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s financial results 
</p>
<p>and relevant ratios). illycaff&egrave; diversified through acquisitions that built the coffee 
</p>
<p>portfolio and took the company into the tea and chocolate businesses. The company 
</p>
<p>accredits its results to unique managerial practices that mirror its organizational 
</p>
<p>identity. Innovation and quality are critical elements of that organizational identity.
</p>
<p> A History of&nbsp;Innovation
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s dedication to innovation stems from 1935, when Francesco Illy invented 
</p>
<p>the &lsquo;illetta&rsquo;, a revolutionary espresso machine that substituted the traditional steam 
</p>
<p>method with compressed air and a system of pressurization to better preserve the 
</p>
<p>flavour of his coffee blend.

</p>
<p>Soon after he took control of the company, Ernesto Illy started a research 
</p>
<p>laboratory that rapidly began to produce a range of products and inventions 
</p>
<p>related to coffee roasting, brewing and drinking. Fourteen new patents were 
</p>
<p>awarded to illycaff&egrave; between 1981 and 2006.
</p>
<p>Throughout the years, the concept of innovation at illycaff&egrave; has been expanded 
</p>
<p>to include a range of projects embracing many different faces of the coffee world. 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;illy art collections&rsquo;, &lsquo;illywords&rsquo;, &lsquo;In Principio&rsquo;, and &lsquo;illystories&rsquo; are examples of the 
</p>
<p>linkages that illycaff&egrave; has built between its network of suppliers, consumers, col-
</p>
<p>laborators and young artists, writers and photographers.
</p>
<p> &lsquo;Excellence and&nbsp;Ethics&rsquo;
</p>
<p>When Andrea Illy took over in the 1990s, he refocused illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s goals towards 
</p>
<p>making it a sustainable company, building on existing company values. As he 
</p>
<p>pointed out:
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave; is a stakeholder company, not a shareholder company. We have always paid primary 
attention to several stakeholders&nbsp; &ndash; specifically clients, partners, collaborators, suppliers, 
local communities, and then shareholders. We manage our relationship with these stakehold-
ers by activating our two main values, excellence and ethics, which drive the company, while 
striving for perfection in all that we do. Of course illycaff&egrave; is a private company that has to 
manage its cash flows; but cash flows together with environmental and social concerns com-
prise our approach to sustainability, through which we respond to our stakeholders&rsquo; needs.
</p>
<p>The place to start was with quality, a concept basic to illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s business model and 
</p>
<p>the fundamental value that grounded the company&rsquo;s strategies and production pro-
</p>
<p>cesses. illycaff&egrave; believed that it could reach its objectives with greater efficacy by 
</p>
<p>means of a business philosophy based on CS, and developed guiding principles 
</p>
<p>founded on quality and encompassing partnerships and social commitment (see 
</p>
<p>Exhibit 18.10).
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave; was the first coffee company in Europe to obtain Quality System ISO 
</p>
<p>9001 certification from Det Norske Veritas, Italy (DNV). Further certification 
</p>
<p>included ISO 9001:2000, UNI EN ISO 14001 and the environmental ISO 14001&nbsp;in 
</p>
<p>2003. In 2004, illycaff&egrave; registered with the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme 
</p>
<p>(EMAS), and published its first Environmental Declaration.
</p>
<p>Making high-quality coffee meant starting at the beginning of the supply chain, 
</p>
<p>and illycaff&egrave; recognised that long-term investments were needed to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>company had a sustainable supply of the best Arabica coffee beans for its blends. As 
</p>
<p>Alessio Colussi, Head of the Green Coffee Department at illycaff&egrave;, said:
</p>
<p>At illycaff&egrave;, we know that value is created on the tree. As you move along the supply chain, 
starting with the harvest, you lose value and quality. The key skill, therefore, is to capture 
and preserve the quality you have on the tree. To make this possible, illycaff&egrave; has always 
valued its relationship with farmers. We buy green coffee directly from those growers who 
produce the highest-quality Arabica coffee beans, rather than purchasing it on the market. 
The farmers have to work hard to produce the highest-quality coffee, and this involves 
personal, economic, as well as managerial efforts. But illycaff&egrave; remunerates these efforts, 
we pay about 30&ndash;35% more than the market price.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>370
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave; established a strong collaborative relationship with its suppliers, starting 
</p>
<p>by selecting the best local growers around the world, mainly in Brazil but also in 
</p>
<p>Central America, India and Africa. illycaff&egrave; also began looking for optimum coffee 
</p>
<p>growing conditions in areas not yet planted with coffee trees. According to Marino 
</p>
<p>Petracco, Research and Technical Development Department at illycaff&egrave; (and Chair 
</p>
<p>of the Food Products &lsquo;Coffee&rsquo; Technical Committee at ISO), they were also looking 
</p>
<p>for something else:
</p>
<p>&hellip; among the others, factors are climate, environment, and techniques, but also love and 
passion for what you do. If you cannot transfer love and passion in your day-to-day work, 
you cannot have the highest-quality coffee.
</p>
<p>Successful collaboration only works if a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship 
</p>
<p>is established. For illycaff&egrave;, this meant finding growers willing to join them in a 
</p>
<p>virtuous cycle of sustainability (see Exhibit 18.11). Alessandro Bucci, Buyer of the 
</p>
<p>Green Coffee Department at illycaff&egrave;, described how their grower partnerships were 
</p>
<p>based on trust
</p>
<p>Throughout the years, illycaff&egrave; has worked on building a strong relationship with local 
growers that is essentially based on trust. If I have to use a Brazilian Portuguese word to 
describe this situation, I would say &lsquo;parceria,&rsquo; which means a partnership between illycaff&egrave; 
and our suppliers, in which both parties gain excellent results. We get the highest-quality 
Arabica coffee beans we are looking for, they receive knowledge, competences, support, 
and margins of course. Our suppliers often do not bargain over the price, actually, because 
they know that we are offering the best price they can get. illycaff&egrave; pays more than a fair 
price; illycaff&egrave; pays for the effort to produce quality.
</p>
<p>When it arrived in Brazil in 1990, illycaff&egrave; was almost unknown among Brazilian 
</p>
<p>coffee producers. The company developed specific initiatives to raise awareness and 
</p>
<p>help it to implement its sustainable strategy. The first major project was the launch 
</p>
<p>of the illycaff&egrave; Brazil Quality Espresso Coffee Award in 1991, the second signifi-
</p>
<p>cant launch was the illycaff&egrave; University of Coffee, established in 2000.
</p>
<p> illycaff&egrave; Brazil Quality Espresso Coffee Award
</p>
<p>Brazil&rsquo;s reputation for low-quality coffee presented a challenge, since quality was 
</p>
<p>integral to illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s business model. In order to find the best growers, and therefore 
</p>
<p>to guarantee procurement of high-quality raw material, illycaff&egrave; began a competi-
</p>
<p>tion. The growers would present samples of their coffee, these samples would be 
</p>
<p>analysed by illycaff&egrave;, and, if approved, purchased. The illycaff&egrave; Brazil Quality 
</p>
<p>Espresso Coffee Award (Pr&ecirc;mio Brasil de Qualidade do Caf&eacute; para Espresso) was 
</p>
<p>created to provide incentives and to recognize growers&rsquo; efforts to produce high- 
</p>
<p>quality coffee. The best coffee of the year was rewarded through a monetary prize, 
</p>
<p>and purchase of a significant amount of the coffee at prices higher than the market 
</p>
<p>value. The number of participants grew from one year to the next, along with the 
</p>
<p>quality of their coffee.
</p>
<p>F. Perrini and A. Russo</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>371
</p>
<p>Evidence that the Espresso Coffee Award improved Brazilian coffee can be seen 
</p>
<p>in the fact that some regions previously thought unfit for coffee cultivation have 
</p>
<p>been discovered and their coffee-growing potential exploited. Such was the case for 
</p>
<p>the Cerrado region, an area that is now producing high-quality coffee. After the first 
</p>
<p>competition, it was discovered that this region had produced some interesting sam-
</p>
<p>ples. Eventually, a number of growers from the state of Paran&agrave;, which had been 
</p>
<p>repeatedly hit by frost, decided to relocate to Cerrado. Other coffee producing areas, 
</p>
<p>such as Sul de Minas and Alta Mogiana, both in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo, subsequently 
</p>
<p>joined the competition seeking to improve the quality of their crops.
</p>
<p>In 1999, the success of the illycaff&egrave; Brazil Quality Espresso Coffee Award com-
</p>
<p>petition led to the creation of Clube illy do Caf&eacute;, a programme through which the 
</p>
<p>best coffee producers reinforced their relationship with illycaff&egrave;. The Clube illy do 
</p>
<p>Caf&egrave; was the first example in Brazil of an organization devoted to strengthening 
</p>
<p>relationships between producers and suppliers. Admission to the Clube illy do Caf&egrave; 
</p>
<p>was free, but only to growers who had sold their coffee to illycaff&egrave; at least once. 
</p>
<p>New members automatically received the Cart&atilde;o Clube illy Vermelho, but their 
</p>
<p>position in the club could be reinforced and additional benefits gained if they man-
</p>
<p>aged to be suppliers of illycaff&egrave; for more than 1&nbsp;year (see Exhibit 18.12 for Clube 
</p>
<p>illy do Caf&egrave; benefits). Of course, high quality had to be maintained&nbsp;&ndash; producers 
</p>
<p>could lose their status within the Clube if they did not maintain a long-term supply-
</p>
<p>ing relationship with illycaff&egrave;. As Giacomo Celi, Agronomist and Buyer of the 
</p>
<p>Green Coffee Department at illycaff&egrave;, highlighted:
</p>
<p>Out of the approximately 450,000 growers in Brazil, illycaff&egrave; only buys Arabica coffee 
beans from about 72 suppliers regularly. Moreover, we only buy 10 to 15 percent of their 
production on average, as this is the amount of coffee that meets our requirements. 
Nevertheless, commitment by coffee producers is very high.
</p>
<p>The illycaff&egrave; Brazil Quality Espresso Coffee Award and the Clube illy do Caf&eacute; 
</p>
<p>built up a mechanism through which Brazilian coffee producers were able to learn 
</p>
<p>and become capable of producing high-quality coffee.
</p>
<p> The illycaff&egrave; University of&nbsp;Coffee
</p>
<p>In 2000, the first academic institution dedicated to coffee producers, the illycaff&egrave; 
</p>
<p>University of Coffee (Universidade illy do Caf&egrave;), was established in Brazil in col-
</p>
<p>laboration with the University of S&atilde;o Paolo. The goal was to transfer illycaff&egrave; 
</p>
<p>knowledge to current growers, operators, and technicians in the coffee supply chain, 
</p>
<p>as well as to future generations, in order to enrich and improve their productivity 
</p>
<p>and managerial skills. Brazil was chosen because it was the largest producer of 
</p>
<p>green coffee in the world, therefore an excellent place from which to harvest the 
</p>
<p>growth that originated the best blends.
</p>
<p>The illycaff&egrave; University of Coffee was built as a network within which different 
</p>
<p>actors performed specific activities. The network facilitated information exchange 
</p>
<p>18 The Roots of Corporate Sustainability: the Art of Managing Innovation&hellip;</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>372
</p>
<p>between illycaff&egrave;, coffee producers, Porto de Santos (illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s official distributor in 
</p>
<p>Brazil), Assicaf&egrave; (the organization in charge of certifying the quality of coffee for 
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave;) and of course the illycaff&egrave; University of Coffee and the Clube illy do Caf&egrave; 
</p>
<p>(see Fig.&nbsp;18.3). People who attended the university could improve their skills, and 
</p>
<p>thus their ability to produce high-quality coffee. Everything around the network of the 
</p>
<p>university was based on specific prerequisites, such as passion and competent human 
</p>
<p>resources, that were a cornerstone of the illycaff&egrave; University of Coffee values.
</p>
<p>The illycaff&egrave; University of Coffee helped producers to became entrepreneurs 
</p>
<p>working toward high quality, and facilitated the creation of a useful, direct relation-
</p>
<p>ship between coffee growers and illycaff&egrave;. The Economist3 reported in 2006 that 
</p>
<p>more than 1,000 growers a year attended a one-day course at the illycaff&egrave; University 
</p>
<p>of Coffee in S&atilde;o Paolo, and that a team of nine agronomists had been travelling the 
</p>
<p>world providing training. Dr. Samuel Ribeiro Giordano, Professor of Agribusiness 
</p>
<p>and Environmental Management, Vice Coordinator of the illycaff&egrave; University of 
</p>
<p>Coffee and Coordinator of Education of the PENSA, Agribusiness Intelligence 
</p>
<p>Centre, also suggested that:
</p>
<p>The main objective of the illycaff&egrave; University of Coffee is to transfer competences to, and build 
new professionals among farmers. The logic that we apply throughout our courses at the univer-
sity is strictly related to what theorists call stakeholder theory. Growers are not just suppliers, 
but stakeholders of the firm. Therefore, following a sustainable approach we have to transfer 
knowledge and techniques to growers wherever they are, even if they do not supply illycaff&egrave;.

<p> Voices from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Supply Chain
</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; Carlos Grossi, President of Alto Cafezal, has cultivated 1,200&nbsp;ha of coffee plants 
</p>
<p>distributed in 11 &lsquo;fazenda&rsquo; (farms) in the Cerrado region since 1972, employing 
</p>
<p>between 800 and 1,500 employees depending on the season. His company has 
</p>
<p>obtained several certifications, including BSCA, Utz Kapeh, and Rainforest Alliance. 
</p>
<p>He has very clear ideas about how CS must be part of the corporate strategy:
</p>
<p>Since 1990, we have changed the way we produce coffee. Comparing coffee with cars, until 
that time we didn&rsquo;t know we could produce a Ferrari; we thought that we probably could 
produce a Fiat. illycaff&egrave; told us that our coffee was very good, something we hadn&rsquo;t known. 
Today, we are very proud to know that we produce the best coffee in the world. We learned 
a lot from illycaff&egrave; about the best way to produce high-quality coffee and obtain certifica-
tions, indicating compliance with social and environmental issues; nevertheless, if certifica-
tions do not bring in income, they do not produce miracles and are not real. The main issue 
is that we work to make a profit and we have to care about cash flows.
</p>
<p>Ednilson Alves Dutra and Walter C&eacute;sar Dutra have owned Fazenda Dutra since 
</p>
<p>1950. The company has three fazenda of about 500&nbsp; ha in the Manhua&ccedil;u region 
</p>
<p>employing between 200 and 600 people according to season and producing 1,500 
</p>
<p>bags of coffee. Fazenda Dutra is Utz Kapeh and BSCA certified. The Dutras empha-
</p>
<p>sized the benefits of learning how to make high-quality Arabica coffee:
</p>
<p>We learned a lot from the course with illycaff&egrave;, and we were able to improve the quality of 
our coffee. In 1999, we sold our coffee to illycaff&egrave; for the first time, the next year, in 2000, 
we were fourth at the illycaff&egrave; Brazil Quality Espresso Coffee Awards. Becoming a supplier 
of illycaff&egrave; helped eliminate the prejudices against our region and local community, which 
learned to value the quality of our coffee. It was a long process, but now we can sell our 
coffee, and thanks to illycaff&egrave;, which we really think of as our family.
</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; Aparecido Naimeg cultivates 560&nbsp;ha of coffee in four fazenda in the Cerrado 
</p>
<p>region, produces 2,000 bags of coffee a year and has been supplying illycaff&egrave; since 
</p>
<p>1992. He had direct experience of the change in the supply-chain structure:
</p>
<p>Becoming an illycaff&egrave; supplier was an opportunity more than a decision. We began in 1992, 
when we also won first prize at the illycaff&egrave; Brazil Quality Espresso Coffee Award competition. 
The award was satisfying to us of course, but the important thing was joining the illycaff&egrave; 
network. We do not have relationships with intermediaries, we just trust illycaff&egrave;, as illycaff&egrave; 
trusts us. It is actually a cooperative relationship. The University is also a network. You can 
learn, of course, but can also participate in a dynamic exchange of ideas and knowledge, not 
just between illycaff&egrave; and its suppliers, but, most important, between producers.
</p>
<p>Francisco Sergio de Assis, who has supplied illycaff&egrave; since 1992 from his 5 fazenda, 
</p>
<p>has 50 permanent employees and 250 seasonal employees during the harvest. He 
</p>
<p>suggested how CS and specific corporate strategies might be related:
</p>
<p>Even small producers can benefit from the corporate strategies that illycaff&egrave; brought to 
Brazil. The first was innovation in our cultivation techniques and technologies, which we 
learned at the illycaff&egrave; University of Coffee. Second, illycaff&egrave; changed the history of coffee 
</p>
<p>18 The Roots of Corporate Sustainability: the Art of Managing Innovation&hellip;</p>
<p/>

<p>374
</p>
<p>production in Brazil since they took the responsibility of rewarding our efforts to achieve 
the quality they required; now they still pay a fair premium that rewards the quality and 
innovation we have applied to improving our production processes.
</p>
<p>Coffee producers clearly understood that recognised certification could become a 
</p>
<p>managerial tool with which to manage their relationships with stakeholders, but 
</p>
<p>there were also broader impacts on sustainability in the supply chain. Public author-
</p>
<p>ities as well as the financial system, for example, have been increasingly influencing 
</p>
<p>the operations of coffee producers. Ednilson Alves Dutra again:
</p>
<p>Banks no longer just ask for our financial status. They now require social and environmental 
responsibility before funding our firms, and the same pressure comes from the Secretary of 
the Environment and the Ministry of Labour. We joined the certification program because 
we aspired to a level of competence that would help us increase our volumes of high-quality 
coffee and to better structure managerial practices in our firm. That is why we focused our 
attention on labour conditions, the environment, and health and safety as well, even though 
keeping up the standards of these certifications is expensive.
</p>
<p>Joao Carlos de Souza Meirelles, the Secretary of Agriculture, sees illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s contri-
</p>
<p>bution as significant: &lsquo;The Illys were pioneers. They helped us learn to produce 
</p>
<p>high-quality coffee, first for them and then for everybody else. Today, we don&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>think anymore in terms of quantity of production. We think in terms of quality of 
</p>
<p>production.&rsquo; And this was echoed in a Fortune report in 2002,4
</p>
<p>... the indirect benefits illycaff&egrave; has brought to Brazil may be even more valuable than the 
millions of dollars a year the company puts in the pockets of the country&rsquo;s coffee farmers. 
illycaff&egrave; taught Brazilian growers how to produce high-quality coffee, in the process help-
ing Brazil shake its bad reputation among the gourmet coffee crowd. As a result, the 
Brazilian growers who supply illycaff&egrave;&nbsp;&ndash; and those who don&rsquo;t&nbsp;&ndash; get more for their coffee 
today, relative to the market price, than a decade ago.
</p>
<p> Other Approaches to&nbsp;CS in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Coffee Supply Chain
</p>
<p>Larger players in the global coffee industry have different business models. In 2002, 
</p>
<p>Nestl&eacute; stated that only 13% of the estimated 13 million bags of coffee it bought each 
</p>
<p>year came directly from the farm. Sara Lee claimed 10%, and Procter &amp; Gamble 
</p>
<p>(P&amp;G) and Kraft didn&rsquo;t buy directly at all. But regardless of their individual com-
</p>
<p>mitments, none of the so called &lsquo;Big Four&rsquo; believed direct purchasing was a long- 
</p>
<p>term solution for ailing growers. &lsquo;For us it would be impractical and less financially 
</p>
<p>feasible to manage commercial relationships and bean quality at the farm level,&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>said P&amp;G spokeswoman Tonia Hyatt. &lsquo;We would have to work with one million 
</p>
<p>growers to buy directly&rsquo;.5 In order to somehow respond to this situation, P&amp;G

</p>
<p>than 1% of total American coffee consumption.6
</p>
<p>Projects comparable to illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s sustainable strategy included the &iexcl;Tierra! 
</p>
<p>Project of Luigi Lavazza S.p.a., the Nespresso AAA SUSTAINABLE QUALITY&trade; 
</p>
<p>Program of Nestl&eacute;, and C.A.F.E Practices by Starbucks (see below). The contrast 
</p>
<p>between the Starbucks approach and that of illycaff&egrave; were highlighted by Wendy 
</p>
<p>Liebmann, President of market researcher WSL Strategic Retail, who stated that 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Starbucks is less about coffee and more about community. illycaff&egrave; is about the 
</p>
<p>elegance of coffee... It is elitist.&rsquo;7

<p> Luigi Lavazza S.p.a.: &iexcl;Tierra! (Source: Lavazza Web Site 2007)
</p>
<p>Luigi Lavazza S.p.a., established in 1894, had a turnover of over &euro;850 million in

</p>
<p>subsidiaries and a wide-reaching international distribution network. In 2007, more 
</p>
<p>than 16 million families in Italy claimed to buy Lavazza coffee, and the company

<p>challenge was to become a worldwide leader in the coffee industry.
</p>
<p>Lavazza has always been committed to developing sustainable activities to 
</p>
<p>improve social welfare. For three generations, the Lavazza family worked to reach 
</p>
<p>this goal alongside other partners. The company focused its attention on sustain-
</p>
<p>ability projects in coffee-producing countries, aware that it was well capable of 
</p>
<p>managing its own agenda in the coffee industry. Lavazza engaged in activities to 
</p>
<p>improve living conditions and social and production structures in countries such as 
</p>
<p>Africa and Central and South America, where coffee production played a crucial 
</p>
<p>role in the national economy.

<p>In 2004, the &iexcl;Tierra! project was conceived, organized, and implemented based 
</p>
<p>on the triple-bottom-line approach, which means taking into account the social, 
</p>
<p>economic, and environmental impacts of coffee production. As declared by Lavazza: 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;The objective of &iexcl;Tierra! is to enable its beneficiaries&nbsp;&ndash; communities of small-scale 
</p>
<p>coffee producers who currently live in extremely disadvantaged situations&nbsp; &ndash; to 
</p>
<p>improve their living conditions and the quality of their products, to acquire new 
</p>
<p>tools in order to trade under more favourable conditions and, finally, to be truly 
</p>
<p>more competitive and autonomous in their choices and in the economic manage-
</p>
<p>ment of their production.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Implementation was supported by Volcaf&egrave;, one of the world&rsquo;s leading coffee- 
</p>
<p>exporting groups, and guidelines were drawn up with the help of the Rainforest 
</p>
<p>Alliance. &iexcl;Tierra! aimed at building differentiated operations that involved not just 
</p>
<p>the coffee-production process, but also education, health, and homes. The project 
</p>
<p>was rolled out in communities in three different coffee-producing countries, 
</p>
<p>Honduras, Colombia, and Peru, and participants were directly involved in the proj-
</p>
<p>ect, bringing in both their direct experience and their needs.
</p>
<p>The communities involved aimed to meet the social and environmental require-
</p>
<p>ments for Rainforest Alliance Certification. In its final stage, the communities 
</p>
<p>directly involved in &iexcl;Tierra! were producing 100% Arabica coffee, and the result 
</p>
<p>was a coffee blend of extraordinary quality but at no extra cost to the final consumer, 
</p>
<p>because the costs of the entire project were part of Lavazza&rsquo;s commitment to CS.

<p> Nestl&eacute;: Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality&trade; (Source: Nespresso 
Web Site 2007)
</p>
<p>As of 2007, Nestl&eacute;, with its headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, was the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>biggest food and beverage company. Sales for 2006 were CHF 98.5 billion, with a 
</p>
<p>net profit of CHF nine billion. Nestl&eacute; employed approximately 260,000 people and 
</p>
<p>had factories or operations in almost every country in the world.
</p>
<p>Based on its Shared Value approach, Nestl&eacute; has always demonstrated CS in the 
</p>
<p>coffee industry, where it operated through several brands: Nescaf&eacute;, Taster&rsquo;s Choice, 
</p>
<p>Ricor&eacute;, Ricoffy, Nespresso, Bonka, Zo&eacute;gas, and Loumidis. While searching for 
</p>
<p>high-quality coffee, Nestl&eacute; realized that only a small percentage of the world&rsquo;s cof-
</p>
<p>fee harvest, around 2%, matched the standards required for the Nespresso Grands 
</p>
<p>Crus. Therefore, Nestl&eacute; focused on lasting and mutually beneficial relationships 
</p>
<p>with the farmers who produce that coffee.

</p>
<p>The Nespresso AAA SUSTAINABLE QUALITY&trade; Program was launched in 
</p>
<p>2003. It was based on an extensive collaboration with farmers across the coffee- 
</p>
<p>producing world, as well as on collaborative partnerships with the Rainforest 
</p>
<p>Alliance. &lsquo;The AAA SUSTAINABLE QUALITY&trade; Program is a set of practices 
</p>
<p>that together enable farmers to benefit directly from the cultivation of the highest- 
</p>
<p>quality coffees. It is not a solution to all of the problems affecting coffee producers 
</p>
<p>around the world, but it is our clear commitment to the farmers who produce 
</p>
<p>Nespresso AAA coffees that they benefit from their relationship with us.&rsquo; Farmers 
</p>
<p>were introduced to the principles of AAA through the Tool for Assessment of 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Quality (TASQ&trade;). In collaboration with the Rainforest Alliance, 
</p>
<p>Nespresso&rsquo; agronomists set up workshops for farmers and trained them in AAA 
</p>
<p>farm practices. Then the farms were assessed by agronomists, and later on Rainforest 
</p>
<p>Alliance independently verified if an individual farm management plan conformed 
</p>
<p>to AAA practices.
</p>
<p>The program was based on a few simple principles established at Nestl&eacute;: &lsquo;First, 
</p>
<p>we pay a premium price for the AAA coffees we buy. Second, we invest in the 
</p>
<p>whole farm assessment and verification process and do not pass this cost on to the 
</p>
<p>farmer. Third, we analyse the data from the TASQ&trade; assessments and work with the 
</p>
<p>farmers to suggest and make improvements at the farm and regional level. Fourth, 
</p>
<p>we set up technical training and assistance workshops for farmers. Finally, we invest 
</p>
<p>in specific projects in the communities.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>The Nespresso AAA SUSTAINABLE QUALITY&trade; Program has produced 
</p>
<p>interesting results. In 2005, Volluto, one of the most popular brands, became Grands 
</p>
<p>Crus, the first 100% AAA SUSTAINABLE QUALITY&trade; coffee in the Nespresso 
</p>
<p>range, as independently verified by the Rainforest Alliance. The next year, in 2006, 
</p>
<p>Caff&egrave; Forte for the B2B market was added to the range of Nespresso Grand Crus 
</p>
<p>sourced 100% from the AAA SUSTAINABLE QUALITY&trade; Program. In 2007, the 
</p>
<p>30% of the total green coffee beans bought by Nespresso came from the AAA pro-
</p>
<p>gram, and the objective was to reach 50% by 2010.

</p>
<p>Starbucks Coffee Company is the leading retailer, roaster, and brand of specialty 
</p>
<p>coffee in the world, with more than 6,000 retail locations in North America, Latin 
</p>
<p>America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific Rim. Born in 1970&nbsp;in Seattle, 
</p>
<p>Starbucks is committed to offering its customers the world&rsquo;s best coffee and the 
</p>
<p>finest coffee experience, while also conducting its business in ways that produce 
</p>
<p>social, environmental, and economic benefits for the communities in which it 
</p>
<p>does business.
</p>
<p>CS at Starbucks runs deeply throughout the company. Starting from its mission 
</p>
<p>statement, several actions are implemented every day for relevant stakeholders: 
</p>
<p>commitment to origins&trade;, environment, communities, and partners. Within this 
</p>
<p>mission, the C.A.F.E. (Coffee And Farmer Equity) Practices were developed and 
</p>
<p>launched in 2001. C.A.F.E.&nbsp;Practices evaluated, recognized, and rewarded produc-
</p>
<p>ers of high-quality, sustainably grown coffee. Guidelines were developed in col-
</p>
<p>laboration with Scientific Certification Systems (SCS), a third-party evaluation and 
</p>
<p>certification firm. C.A.F.E.&nbsp;Practices sought to ensure that Starbucks sourced sus-
</p>
<p>tainably grown and processed coffee by evaluating the economic, social, and envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental aspects of coffee production against a defined set of criteria.
</p>
<p>Starbucks buys high-quality Arabica coffee. According to its commitment to 
</p>
<p>origins&trade;, Starbucks pays premium prices that result in a profit for the farmers 
</p>
<p>and their families. In 2005, Starbucks paid on average $1.28 per pound for high-
</p>
<p>quality coffee beans. This was 23% higher than the average New&nbsp;York &lsquo;C&rsquo; market 
</p>
<p>price (NYC).
</p>
<p>In 2000, Starbucks agreed to sell Fair Trade Certified&trade; coffee in its retail outlets 
</p>
<p>(Table&nbsp;18.1). Starbucks purchased 11.5 million pounds of Fair Trade Certified&trade; 
</p>
<p>coffee in 2005, paying a minimum of $1.26 per pound for nonorganic green Arabica 
</p>
<p>coffee and $1.41 per pound for organic green Arabica coffee. Of all the Fair Trade 
</p>
<p>Certified&trade; coffee imported into the U.S. in 2005, Starbucks purchased 21%, 
</p>
<p>becoming the largest purchaser of Fair Trade Certified&trade; coffee in North America. 
</p>
<p>Considering the rest of the coffee purchased by Starbucks, Mary Williams, a 
</p>
<p>Starbucks senior vice president, said &lsquo;We would love to know where all our coffee 
</p>
<p>comes from, but it is very difficult to purchase directly from such small farmers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>(Stein 2002).

</p>
<p> The Business Dilemma
</p>
<p>If we consider the international coffee industry, we are happy to see that today CS-related 
actions are gaining momentum among several organizations, but we believe that more can 
be done. We believe CS is not just a matter of social and environmental issues, but strictly 
refers to companies&rsquo; responsibility. That is why we manufacture coffee focusing on innova-
tion, that is the quality, and the networking, that is the knowledge transfer, as drivers of 
sustainability (Andrea Illy)
</p>
<p>Managers now need to determine whether the illycaff&egrave; CS concept is different, 
</p>
<p>what impact its initiatives have had on sustainability in the supply chain, and 
</p>
<p>whether this approach really is a source of competitive advantage over rivals&nbsp;&ndash; is 
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s sustainable strategy sufficiently differentiated from other business mod-
</p>
<p>els that it offers the potential for value creation within the company?
</p>
<p>Several other issues must also be explored. What are the future challenges for 
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave;? Are competitors imitating illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s CS strategy, and if so, how long does 
</p>
<p>it take them to catch up? Is the illycaff&egrave; model viable on a larger scale? Is the illy-
</p>
<p>caff&egrave; CS concept the most efficient initiative for emerging markets? Where should 
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave; position itself in the market? Do its sourcing and delivering strategies sup-
</p>
<p>port the brand? Is illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s business model applicable to other industries?
</p>
<p> illycaff&egrave; Social Value Improvements (2007&ndash;2014)
</p>
<p>During the last years, illycaff&egrave; strengthened its commitment towards corporate sus-
</p>
<p>tainability. A clear example is the value of &ldquo;Ethics&rdquo;, evidently stated by the com-
</p>
<p>pany. Actually, illycaff&egrave; kept on reinforcing its aim of creating value for all the 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, merging high-quality products with sustainability, transparency and 
</p>
<p>personal growth.
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave; is a fundamental part of Gruppo Illy S.p.A., a holding company includ-
</p>
<p>ing different high-quality food and drinks firms. The whole group encompasses all 
</p>
<p>companies that consider sustainability as a key business driver. Moreover, to under-
</p>
<p>line the commitment towards corporate sustainability, illycaff&egrave; research and innova-
</p>
<p>tion is intended to develop new environmental friendly industrial activities 
</p>
<p>(especially concerning with recycle materials), partnering with Universities of 
</p>
<p>Padova and Trieste, together with the Agricultural Institute of Slovenia.
</p>
<p>One of the main achievements accomplished in the last years concerned the 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Value Report, which clearly and transparently stated all the declared 
</p>
<p>goals, actions and projects carried out by illycaff&egrave; to implement corporate sustain-
</p>
<p>ability in three different forms: economic, social, and environmental.
</p>
<p>The report has been prepared following the GRI-G3.1 sustainability reporting 
</p>
<p>guidelines and audited by an independent third-party. It depicted how performance 
</p>
<p>is linked to responsible management.
</p>
<p>Actually, the report explained the main actions implemented by illycaff&egrave; during 
</p>
<p>the period up to 2013, highlighting the company desire to create an environment 
</p>
<p>that brings sustainability at the core of all the business activities. For example, the 
</p>
<p>18 The Roots of Corporate Sustainability: the Art of Managing Innovation&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>380
</p>
<p>company governance structure has been composed by a Sustainability Committee, 
</p>
<p>whose role and responsibilities enclosed the engagement towards responsible man-
</p>
<p>agement, the accountability of the Value Report, the environmental critical consid-
</p>
<p>erations, and other activities performed to support corporate sustainability.
</p>
<p>As a result of the corporate sustainability strategy implemented by illycaff&egrave;, one 
</p>
<p>of the most important achievements was the Responsible Supply Chain Process 
</p>
<p>Certification obtained in 2011, which awarded the sustainable green coffee supply 
</p>
<p>chain process and the ability of creating value for all the stakeholders following the 
</p>
<p>principles of traceability, reciprocity and quality. An independent third-party princi-
</p>
<p>pally certified that all the coffee has been purchased without intermediaries (directly 
</p>
<p>from coffee growers) and coffee growers have been paid a higher price with respect 
</p>
<p>to market average. To give some interesting data of the collaboration born with sup-
</p>
<p>pliers: from 2010 to 2013 more than 5,000 coffee growers attended courses and 
</p>
<p>meetings to improve and to share know-how, in order to achieve always better prod-
</p>
<p>uct quality, following an ethical approach common to all the supply chain.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company reinforced its sustainable programs by adhering in 
</p>
<p>2012 to the Global Compact and drafting a Sustainability Manifesto that, together 
</p>
<p>with the Code of Ethics, represented a fundamental step in order to share the strat-
</p>
<p>egy of sustainable and ethical business with all the stakeholders. Regarding the 
</p>
<p>Global Compact, it is a United Nations initiative to encourage sustainable global 
</p>
<p>economy with the adhesion to ten principles concerning human rights, environment, 
</p>
<p>labour and corruption. illycaff&egrave;, in compliance with Global Compact, committed to 
</p>
<p>follow those ten principles in pursuing its business activities. The Sustainability 
</p>
<p>Manifesto was a clear example of the company commitment, because it stated the 
</p>
<p>ethical principles applied inside the organization. Moreover, illycaff&egrave; adhered to the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization (ILO) principles, purchasing coffee by suppliers 
</p>
<p>that do not employ children younger than 14&nbsp;years old.
</p>
<p>Besides certification and adhesion to important initiatives, illycaff&egrave; strengthened 
</p>
<p>its contributions to the territories and communities where it was and is still operat-
</p>
<p>ing. As far as suppliers are concerned, the company supported projects to develop 
</p>
<p>infrastructures in order to enhance the living conditions of coffee growing commu-
</p>
<p>nities and committed to apply, as a general rule, the employment of local resources. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the company also kept on monitoring all the suppliers, with who illy-
</p>
<p>caff&egrave; continued to apply the strategy of building increasingly strong and long- lasting 
</p>
<p>relationships.
</p>
<p>Other contributions to local communities and territories have been made possible 
</p>
<p>by Ernesto Illy Foundation, a non-profit organization aimed at increasing ethics and 
</p>
<p>sustainability through initiatives with producing countries and other territories 
</p>
<p>where business is carried out. To give an example, among the Foundation activities, 
</p>
<p>there was the Master degree in coffee economics and science to enhance quality and 
</p>
<p>corporate sustainability strategies.
</p>
<p>A closer eye on environmental activities cannot be avoided. On the one hand, 
</p>
<p>there was a commitment to reduce illycaff&egrave; direct environmental impact and on the 
</p>
<p>other hand, this commitment tended to be spread to collaborators in order to effi-
</p>
<p>ciently and effectively implement the Comprehensive Environmental Management 
</p>
<p>F. Perrini and A. Russo</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>381
</p>
<p>System. The latter was developed to minimize the direct environmental impact, 
</p>
<p>reducing waste and pollution. To stress its commitment illycaff&egrave; signed an agree-
</p>
<p>ment with the Ministry of the Environment regarding the analysis of the impact of 
</p>
<p>climate on coffee sector. Moreover, in 2012, the company implemented the LCA&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>Life Cycle Assessment&nbsp;&ndash; using software to reduce the environmental impact during 
</p>
<p>the business processes. In addition, illycaff&egrave; promoted in the areas where coffee was 
</p>
<p>produced agricultural activities with responsible water consumption, low waste and 
</p>
<p>little employment of chemical fertilizers.
</p>
<p>Also concerning with the environment, illycaff&egrave; managed to win &ldquo;The Impresa 
</p>
<p>Ambiente Pirze&rdquo;, one of the most prestigious Italian award.
</p>
<p>Two final important recognitions underlined how corporate sustainability was 
</p>
<p>appreciated particularly externally. As a matter of fact, illycaff&egrave; was an official part-
</p>
<p>ner of EXPO 2015 and the Ethisphere Institute recognized the company as one of 
</p>
<p>the World&rsquo;s Most Ethical Companies for 2014, thanks to its achievements in corpo-
</p>
<p>rate governance, its code of ethics, its CSR strategies and investments to innovate its 
</p>
<p>processes in a sustainable manner. This award was of particular interest in light of 
</p>
<p>the fact that illycaff&egrave; was the only one Italian company included by Ethisphere 
</p>
<p>Institute in its list.
</p>
<p>To sum up, illycaff&egrave; improved its strategy based on corporate sustainability, 
</p>
<p>especially by setting a reporting activity and transparently committing to sustain-
</p>
<p>able present and future projects. To make some example, among future goals written 
</p>
<p>in the Sustainable Value Report, there were, first of all, the ability of increasing the 
</p>
<p>number of coffee producers with Supply Chain certification, the implementation of 
</p>
<p>a Sustainability Road Map to develop initiatives in line with Global Compact prin-
</p>
<p>ciples and the improvement of stakeholders&rsquo; engagement.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 18.1: The International Coffee Organization
</p>
<p>The International Coffee Organization (ICO) is the main intergovernmental organi-
</p>
<p>zation for coffee, bringing together producing and consuming countries. The ICO 
</p>
<p>was established in 1963, a year after the first 5-year International Coffee Agreement 
</p>
<p>came into force in 1962. As of January 2007, ICO members comprise 45 exporting 
</p>
<p>countries and 32 importing countries from all over the world. ICO members have to 
</p>
<p>comply with the International Coffee Agreement. The text of the new International 
</p>
<p>Coffee Agreement was written at a meeting of the 63 Member Governments of the 
</p>
<p>International Coffee Council in London on 27 and 28 September 2000. It was for-
</p>
<p>mally adopted by the Council in Resolution 393.
</p>
<p>A 6-year collaboration to strengthen international cooperation among producing 
</p>
<p>and consuming countries became provisionally operative on 1 October 2001 and 
</p>
<p>definitively on 17 May 2005. It includes a number of new objectives reflecting the 
</p>
<p>ICO mission, such as encouraging members to develop a sustainable coffee econ-
</p>
<p>omy, promoting coffee consumption and the quality of coffee, providing a forum for 
</p>
<p>the private sector, promoting training and information programmes designed to 
</p>
<p>assist the transfer of technology relevant to member countries, and analyzing and 
</p>
<p>consulting on suitable projects to benefit the world coffee economy.

<p>The Brazil Specialty Coffee Association
</p>
<p>The Brazil Specialty Coffee Association (BSCA) was founded by a group of grow-
</p>
<p>ers of high-quality coffees to bring to the market their finest specialty products, the 
</p>
<p>very best of Caf&eacute;s do Brazil. BSCA has members in all areas of Brazil where high-
</p>
<p>quality Arabica coffees are grown: Sul de Minas, Matas de Minas, Cerrado, 
</p>
<p>Chapadas de Minas, Mogiana, Bahia, and Parana.

</p>
<p>BSCA&rsquo;s purpose is to obtain thorough research and quality-control techniques 
</p>
<p>that comply with the standards of excellence of Brazilian coffees offered to the 
</p>
<p>international market. Founded in 1991, it has sent representatives to major interna-
</p>
<p>tional events related to the specialty coffees. Since 1992, BSCA has attended all 
</p>
<p>Conferences and Shows of the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). It 
</p>
<p>has its own booth that exhibits a large variety of Brazilian gourmet coffees, and it 
</p>
<p>organizes lectures and promotional events.
</p>
<p>Since 1993, the entity is also responsible for organizing meetings in Europe, 
</p>
<p>together with gourmet roasting companies. Representing Brazilian coffees, BSCA 
</p>
<p>actively participates in congresses and fairs in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, 
</p>
<p>the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Norway. At these events, it distributes rel-
</p>
<p>evant information and promotional samples, as well as tests to demonstrate the qual-
</p>
<p>ity of its member companies&rsquo; specialty coffees.
</p>
<p>Rainforest Alliance
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Rainforest Alliance works to conserve biodiversity and ensure sustainable 
</p>
<p>livelihoods by transforming land-use practices, business practices, and consumer 
</p>
<p>behaviour. Producers who want their farms to be successful, productive, efficient, 
</p>
<p>and sustainable follow the farm-management guidelines continuously developed 
</p>
<p>since 1992 by the Sustainable Agriculture Network, a coalition of independent 
</p>
<p>NGOs. By following the guidelines, farmers can reduce costs, conserve natural 
</p>
<p>resources, control pollution, conserve wildlife habitat, ensure rights and benefits for 
</p>
<p>workers, improve the quality of their harvest, and earn the Rainforest Alliance 
</p>
<p>Certified seal of approval.

<p>The founders created an organization that could stand independently from the 
</p>
<p>producers and the roasters. They chose the name &lsquo;Utz Kapeh&rsquo; which means &lsquo;good 
</p>
<p>coffee&rsquo; in the Mayan language Quich&ugrave;. An office was opened in Guatemala City in 
</p>
<p>1999. In 2002, the head office was opened in The Netherlands. In March 2007, Utz 
</p>
<p>Kapeh updated its name to UTZ CERTIFIED, &lsquo;Good inside.&rsquo; This updated name 
</p>
<p>combines confidence in the model and pride in their heritage, with clearer commu-
</p>
<p>nication for the international market. UTZ CERTIFIED assures the social and envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental quality of coffee production. The idea behind UTZ CERTIFIED is to 
</p>
<p>create recognition for sustainable coffee producers and tools for roasters and brands 
</p>
<p>to respond to a growing demand for assurance of responsibly produced coffee.

<p>Exhibit 18.6: The Fair Trade Movement
</p>
<p>Many definitions of &lsquo;Fair Trade&rsquo; have been proposed, but the following issued by 
</p>
<p>the informal umbrella network, FINE,8 is widely accepted within the movement.
</p>
<p>Fair Trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency, and respect, which 
seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by 
offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and 
workers, especially in the south. Fair Trade organizations (backed by consumers) are 
engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness rising, and in campaigning for changes 
in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.
</p>
<p>FLO Standards
</p>
<p>Trader Standards stipulate that traders that buy directly from the Fairtrade pro-
</p>
<p>ducer organizations must:
</p>
<p>&bull; Pay a price to producers that at least covers the costs of sustainable production: 
</p>
<p>the Fairtrade Minimum Price.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pay a premium that producers can invest in development: the Fairtrade Premium.
</p>
<p>&bull; Partially pay in advance, when producers ask for it.
</p>
<p>&bull; Sign contracts that allow for long-term planning and sustainable production 
</p>
<p>practices.
</p>
<p>Producers and traders of coffee have to comply with specific Product Standards 
</p>
<p>for small farmers&rsquo; organizations (such as a cooperative or association).
</p>
<p>&bull; Product description. The Fairtrade Standards cover two varieties of coffee: 
</p>
<p>Arabica coffee (Coffea Arabica) and Robusta coffee (Coffea Canephora).
</p>
<p>8 FINE is an informal umbrella network established in 1998 within which representatives of the 
most important worldwide Fair Trade networks meet to share information and coordinate activi-
ties. The acronym FINE stands for the first letters of the following four Fair Trade networks: 
Fairtrade Labelling Organizations (FLO) International, the International Federation for Alternative 
Trade (IFAT), the Network of European World Shops (NEWS!), and the European Fair Trade 
Association (EFTA).

</p>
<p>&bull; Procure a Long-Term and Stable Relationship. Buyers and sellers will strive 
</p>
<p>to establish a long-term and stable relationship in which the rights and interests 
</p>
<p>of both are mutually respected.
</p>
<p>&bull; International Customary Conditions. All other customary conditions applica-
</p>
<p>ble to any international transaction will apply, such as the conditions of the 
</p>
<p>European Contract of Coffee, unless overruled by any of the special FLO 
</p>
<p>conditions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Pricing and Premium. Buyers shall pay producer organizations at least the 
</p>
<p>Fairtrade minimum price as set by FLO.&nbsp; The Fairtrade minimum prices vary 
</p>
<p>according to the type and origin of the coffee. In addition to the Fairtrade mini-
</p>
<p>mum price, the buyers shall pay a Fairtrade Premium as set by FLO at 5 US cents 
</p>
<p>per pound of coffee. For certified organic coffee, an additional premium of 15 US 
</p>
<p>cents per pound of green coffee will be due, in addition to the Fairtrade minimum 
</p>
<p>price or the market reference price, respectively. If the market price is higher than 
</p>
<p>the Fairtrade minimum price, the market price shall apply. At various times 
</p>
<p>between 1997 and 2003, the Fairtrade coffee price was double that of the world 
</p>
<p>market (see Figure, below).
</p>
<p>&bull; Prefinancing/credit. The buyer shall make available up to 60% of the contract 
</p>
<p>value, according to what the seller stipulates.

<p>As of October 2006, FLO was working with 586 Fair Trade Certified Producer 
</p>
<p>Organizations representing over one million farmers and workers from more than 50 
</p>
<p>countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Including with their dependents, five 
</p>
<p>million people were affected, as well as 469 certified traders (consisting of exporters, 
</p>
<p>importers, processors, and manufacturers). Between 2004 and 2005, Fairtrade labelled 
</p>
<p>sales across the world grew by 32% to more than 168,863 metric tonnes (MT). In 
</p>
<p>2005, millions of consumers worldwide bought some &euro;1.1 billion of Fairtrade labelled 
</p>
<p>products, 37% more than the year before. All product lines expanded their markets, 
</p>
<p>especially fair trade coffee in the U.S. (+70,9%) and the U.K. (+34%).

<p>Attracted by Fairtrade&rsquo;s success with consumers, more companies knocked on 
</p>
<p>the door of the labelling organizations. Marks and Spencer, one of the largest food 
</p>
<p>and clothes retailers in the UK, switched its entire range coffee and tea to Fairtrade, 
</p>
<p>totalling 38 lines, in a move which was estimated will increase the value of all 
</p>
<p>Fairtrade instant and ground coffee sold in the UK supermarkets by 18%, and 
</p>
<p>increase the value of Fairtrade tea by approximately 30%.

<p>Exhibit 18.10: illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s Guiding Principles Based on Quality
</p>
<p>Consumer: the client comes first. The main object of illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s passion for quality 
</p>
<p>is to provide complete satisfaction to clients and consumers. Besides being respon-
</p>
<p>sible for the unfinished product that leaves the plant, the company also feels jointly 
</p>
<p>responsible for the finished product&nbsp;&ndash; an espresso must always be perfect through-
</p>
<p>out the world. Toward this goal, illycaff&egrave; adheres to and attempts to improve every 
</p>
<p>aspect of the standards of quality, in production, the processes, and in customer 
</p>
<p>services.
</p>
<p>Team spirit: care for collaborators. The policy of collaborator growth reaches 
</p>
<p>toward the self-fulfilment and happiness of these people, based on respecting the 
</p>
<p>dignity of others, on professional and personal growth, on their involvement in their 
</p>
<p>work, their sense of responsibility, and a system of rewarding commendable work. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, the company&rsquo;s success depends on the skill and contribution of all the col-
</p>
<p>laborators. illycaff&egrave; aims at developing the competencies of the collaborators 
</p>
<p>through technical training in each sector and at providing for the necessary resources 
</p>
<p>and a pleasant, stimulating, and safe working environment.
</p>
<p>Partnership with the supplier. In the area of business ethics, the company pol-
</p>
<p>icy emphasizes mutual benefits with its suppliers by both selecting and leading them 
</p>
<p>with its values. It fosters long-term collaborations convinced that only a relationship 
</p>
<p>based on mutual interest and growth can guarantee quality and, at the same time, 
</p>
<p>improve the value of the product. In particular, illycaff&egrave; provides the producers of 
</p>
<p>green coffee with its acquired know-how and expertise in ways to obtain better- 
</p>
<p>quality coffee, for which it offers a sustainable, above-market price.
</p>
<p>Social commitment. illycaff&egrave; deeply respects the environment and communities 
</p>
<p>where it works. It undertakes not only to comply with the regulations, but also to 
</p>
<p>implement policies of sustainable development for both the environment and soci-
</p>
<p>ety, by contributing to the development of the territory and the community living 
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s commitment with financers. illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s commitment to and its pas-
</p>
<p>sion for quality and the protection of the shareholders&rsquo; and financiers&rsquo; legitimate 
</p>
<p>interests, constantly work toward improving economic performance, aimed at self- 
</p>
<p>financing and the growth of the company&rsquo;s value.

</p>
<p>Exhibit 18.11: Sustainability in illycaff&egrave;
</p>
<p>Sustainable development and quality: an inseparable pair. To make the best cof-
</p>
<p>fee, you need to use the best coffee beans, i.e., the highest-quality Arabica pur-
</p>
<p>chased by illycaff&egrave;, mainly in Brazil but also in Central America, India, and Africa. 
</p>
<p>illy quality begins at its origin, with its cooperative relationship with the cultivators, 
</p>
<p>based on principles of mutual respect and listening to each other&rsquo;s requirements and 
</p>
<p>needs. This company philosophy is consistent with its own strategy and has led 
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave; to work on sustainable development since the end of the 1980s.

</p>
<p>One hundred percent of illy coffee is purchased directly from the producers. 
</p>
<p>We know each and every one of our suppliers; we educate and train them to produce 
</p>
<p>quality, while protecting the environment; we purchase the high quality our suppli-
</p>
<p>ers produce, always paying a price that ensures them a profit: this is at the core of 
</p>
<p>the relationship illy has created and maintained with the growers who supply its raw 
</p>
<p>material. It is a relationship based primarily on trust.
</p>
<p>Quality as a tool for enhancing the living conditions of growers over time. 
</p>
<p>The suppliers need to be very carefully selected. This is accomplished through a 
</p>
<p>system of quality-incentive awards established in 1991&nbsp;in Brazil with the Pr&ecirc;mio 
</p>
<p>Brasil de Qualidade do Caf&eacute; para Espresso directed at the best growers in the coun-
</p>
<p>try. The transfer of know-how begins once the cultivators have been selected. illy-
</p>
<p>caff&egrave; agronomists make every effort to transfer knowledge and techniques of 
</p>
<p>cultivation, harvesting, and processing. The growers are thus enabled to meet the 
</p>
<p>high standards of quality required by illycaff&egrave;. Each year the company team of 
</p>
<p>agronomists dedicate an average of 300&nbsp;days of training to the growers. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave;, in conjunction with the University of S&atilde;o Paolo, has created the University 
</p>
<p>of Coffee in Brazil, which offers both practical and theoretical courses for 
</p>
<p>producers.
</p>
<p>Fair price. illycaff&egrave; calculates a minimum price, below which it never goes, 
</p>
<p>under any circumstances. This price is based on variables such as the country of 
</p>
<p>origin, the type of market, the quality of the product, and the cost of production. 
</p>
<p>This minimum price is based on the international market quotations (NYC) and on 
</p>
<p>the cost of production to which a fair margin is added: a margin to reward the pro-
</p>
<p>ducer for the greater care he has taken with his crops and to guarantee him a profit. 
</p>
<p>illycaff&egrave;&rsquo;s price policy is based on an empirical approach, built partly through the 
</p>
<p>long-term relationships the company maintains with its producers.

<p>19Microfinance as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Shakespearean Tragedy: The&nbsp;Creation of&nbsp;Shared Value, 
While Acting Responsibly
</p>
<p>Harry&nbsp;Hummels
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Shakespeare would have been thrilled by all the intrigues in this relatively new 
</p>
<p>and emerging financial theatre. All the elements are there to write yet another 
</p>
<p>masterpiece&nbsp;&ndash; this time on the rise of King Microfinance, his conquering the world 
</p>
<p>and the subsequent gradual decay of his empire. This case study will describe the 
</p>
<p>struggle of one of the king&rsquo;s knights&nbsp;&ndash; ACTIAM Impact Investing&nbsp;&ndash; in enlarging the 
</p>
<p>empire in a way that simultaneously serves the interest of the people and the king&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>financiers. So what happened?
</p>
<p>In 2006 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Grameen Bank and its founder, 
</p>
<p>Mohammad Yunus. In his acceptance speech Yunus described the launch and devel-
</p>
<p>opment of the bank.
</p>
<p>Grameen Bank gives loans to nearly 7.0&nbsp;million poor people, 97 per cent of whom are 
women, in 73,000 villages in Bangladesh. (&hellip;) We focused on women because we found 
giving loans to women always brought more benefits to the family. In a cumulative way the 
bank has given out loans totalling about US $6.0&nbsp; billion. The repayment rate is 99%. 
Grameen Bank routinely makes profit. Financially, it is self-reliant and has not taken donor 
money since 1995. Deposits and own resources of Grameen Bank today amount to 143 per 
cent of all outstanding loans. According to Grameen Bank&rsquo;s internal survey, 58 percent of 
our borrowers have crossed the poverty line.1
</p>
<p>In the decades following the launch of Grameen Bank microfinance spread with 
</p>
<p>viral speed. Across the globe initiatives were taken to improve access to finance for 
</p>
<p>the poor, most notably in South and South East Asia, Central America and the 
</p>
<p>Caribbean, and South America. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, microfinance also

</p>
<p>emerged quite rapidly in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Assuming that one 
</p>
<p>could do good, while at the same generating high returns microfinance became the 
</p>
<p>ascending star on the financial firmament. The amount of investors rose 
</p>
<p>spectacularly.
</p>
<p>Only a few months passed since Yunus&rsquo; acceptance speech until the first cracks 
</p>
<p>in the pavement became visible. The wealth of investment opportunities in 
</p>
<p>emerging markets attracted a highly diversified audience of investors&nbsp; &ndash; ranging 
</p>
<p>from professional investors to adventurers. It resulted in a somewhat wrought-up 
</p>
<p>market that showed characteristics of what Shiller2 would have called the &lsquo;irrational 
</p>
<p>exuberance&rsquo; of the microfinance market. This development led to excesses, damag-
</p>
<p>ing the sustainable development of the microfinance sector. Following the initial 
</p>
<p>public offering (IPO) of the largest Mexican microfinance institution (MFI), Banco 
</p>
<p>Compartamos, Muhammad Yunus himself warned against the inflation of microfi-
</p>
<p>nance. Instead of opening up the market to allow for more competition benefiting 
</p>
<p>the poor, the IPO primarily resulted in Banco Compartamos&rsquo; expansion and its 
</p>
<p>increased domination of the Mexican microfinance market. Among other things, the 
</p>
<p>MFI was criticised for charging its customer excessive interest rates.3 In 2010 a 
</p>
<p>microfinance crisis emerged in Andhra Pradesh following the suicide of a number 
</p>
<p>of microfinance borrowers. And then there were the discussions on excessive 
</p>
<p>interest rates, client over-indebtedness, tax avoidance and a lack of transparency of 
</p>
<p>MFIs that did not really contribute to raising confidence in the creation of a sustainable 
</p>
<p>microfinance industry.
</p>
<p>This case study focuses on ACTIAM, previously known as SNS Asset 
</p>
<p>Management, as a medium-sized Dutch asset manager,4 that developed microfinance 
</p>
<p>as a successful business activity. ACTIAM Impact Investing took responsibility 
</p>
<p>for building this particular business line. The objective of the asset manager&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>development investment department was to create shared value (CSV) for both 
</p>
<p>investors and investees and to build a sustainable investment practice. The ACTIAM 
</p>
<p>microfinance proposition already echoed the core idea behind Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>CSV framework&nbsp;&ndash; even at a time when that framework was not available yet.
</p>
<p>When ACTIAM started its activities in microfinance in 2007, investors were 
</p>
<p>open and sympathetic to the idea of doing good while doing well through their 
</p>
<p>investments. This attitude, however, changed as a result of the financial crisis. 
</p>
<p>Pressured by the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the national 
</p>
<p>central banks, and other supervisory authorities, the appetite for high-risk, long- 
</p>
<p>term, and illiquid investments significantly decreased. Investors changed their 
</p>
<p>policies and introduced tighter risk management procedures. In general, the 
</p>
<p>crisis and all the legislation that resulted from it, such as the Alternative Investment 
</p>
<p>Fund Management Directive (AIFMD), has had a negative effect on the

</p>
<p>willingness of investors to allocate resources5 to alternative investments&nbsp;&ndash; including 
</p>
<p>microfinance.
</p>
<p>During the spring of 2007, when ACTIAM launched the first of two microfinance 
</p>
<p>funds it was to bring to the market in just over a year, the situation was different. 
</p>
<p>ACTIAM attracted investments up to an amount of 320mn Euros from institutional 
</p>
<p>investors, including pension funds and insurance companies. At the core of the 
</p>
<p>investment philosophy was the belief that microfinance could and should be benefi-
</p>
<p>cial to the poor. Oddly enough, it was not necessary to prove the social value added 
</p>
<p>of microfinance in those days. Microfinance was seen as a contribution to sustain-
</p>
<p>able development per se, which needed no additional proof of its social value for the 
</p>
<p>microfinance borrowers or the communities they lived in. However, that was going 
</p>
<p>to change rapidly, resulting in the integration of the social rationale of microfinance 
</p>
<p>in the due diligence and the analysis of the underlying investments. The funds aimed 
</p>
<p>at providing capital to microfinance institutions, which enabled these institutions 
</p>
<p>to disperse loans to the poor and low-income people. These loans were intended 
</p>
<p>to bring the microfinance clients in a situation of increased financial control. 
</p>
<p>With blue and white-collar jobs being largely absent, access to finance helped the 
</p>
<p>microfinance entrepreneurs to invest in their own business. Without this key social 
</p>
<p>aspect of microfinance ACTIAM Impact Investing&rsquo;s business proposition would 
</p>
<p>have been void of meaning.6 However, while disbursing loans to microfinance insti-
</p>
<p>tutions some unintended side effects of microfinance in a global environment came 
</p>
<p>to the fore, which were potentially harmful to micro-entrepreneurs.
</p>
<p>This study starts with a description of microfinance and its development in the 
</p>
<p>new millennium. Having introduced ACTIAM Impact Investing and its institutional 
</p>
<p>microfinance funds I then turn to the potential social risks connected to microfi-
</p>
<p>nance. A few of these risks impacted the relationship between ACTIAM Impact 
</p>
<p>Investing and its investors, consisting of some of the largest institutions in the pen-
</p>
<p>sion sector in the world. One intriguing threat that I want to focus on in this study 
</p>
<p>deals with sudden changes in the external environment as a result of social unrest 
</p>
<p>that ACTIAM itself was not instrumental in, but immediately affected the sustain-
</p>
<p>ability of its business model. The events taking place elsewhere in the world were 
</p>
<p>kinds of &lsquo;dei ex machina&rsquo; for the asset manager and its investors. The relevance of 
</p>
<p>this case study is not limited to the financial sector, including the microfinance sec-
</p>
<p>tor. Other industries, like the apparel industry, the consumer staples industry or the 
</p>
<p>extractives industry, to mention just a few, face similar problems.
</p>
<p>5 The problem is not only the allocation of money but also of additional resources like management 
attention, portfolio management capacity and reputation management.
6 Institutional investors face a trade-off between financial only and impact investments. Based on 
their fiduciary responsibility institutional investors want to be compensated for their potential loss 
of financial return.

</p>
<p> The Case of&nbsp;Microfinance
</p>
<p> The Origin and&nbsp;Growth of&nbsp;Microfinance
Microfinance is about providing access to financial services to previously excluded 
</p>
<p>clients. Usually those clients can be found in low-income economies, although 
</p>
<p>microfinance emerges in developed countries as well. It refers to informal and for-
</p>
<p>mal arrangements offering financial services to low-income and poor people, 
</p>
<p>thereby focusing on micro-entrepreneurs. Most financial transactions are in the 
</p>
<p>form of microcredit, although (micro) finance institutions increasingly offer savings 
</p>
<p>and insurance products to their clientele. In his book Banker to the Poor, Mohammad 
</p>
<p>Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, explains that providing credit to poor entre-
</p>
<p>preneurs provides them with a way out of poverty.
</p>
<p>The concept of microfinance is not new. Savings and credit groups that have 
</p>
<p>operated for centuries include the &ldquo;susus&rdquo; of Ghana, &ldquo;chit funds&rdquo; in India, &ldquo;tandas&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>in Mexico, &ldquo;arisan&rdquo; in Indonesia, &ldquo;cheetu&rdquo; in Sri Lanka, &ldquo;tontines&rdquo; in West Africa, 
</p>
<p>and &ldquo;pasanaku&rdquo; in Bolivia. In Europe, microfinance dates back to the sixteenth cen-
</p>
<p>tury when informal and small-scale lending and savings clubs were established. In 
</p>
<p>Ireland, Jonathan Swift initiated a loan fund system early in the eighteenth century, 
</p>
<p>using peer monitoring to enforce weekly repayments. In Germany, after the hunger 
</p>
<p>year of 1846/47, Raiffeisen created rural savings and credit cooperatives, originally 
</p>
<p>called credit associations, and currently known as Raiffeisenbanken. The concept of 
</p>
<p>microfinance as it is known today, received wide attention and recognition since the 
</p>
<p>establishment of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1976.
</p>
<p>Over the years the microfinance industry has shown significant development and 
</p>
<p>change. In the eighties and nineties of the last century the market was dominated by 
</p>
<p>NGOs and development aid organizations. Since 2004, the industry started growing 
</p>
<p>at an unprecedented rate. Both donors and investors began channelling large 
</p>
<p>amounts of funding to microfinance institutions (MFIs) across the globe&nbsp;&ndash; mostly 
</p>
<p>via microfinance investment vehicles (MIVs). Table&nbsp;19.1 offers an overview of the 
</p>
<p>rapidly expanding supply side of the market but, at the same time, can be seen as a 
</p>
<p>clear indication of the growing demand for microfinance capital. The financial crisis 
</p>
<p>caused a minor slowdown of the rapid increase of investments in microfinance, 
</p>
<p>although the sector still shows impressive growth figures. MicroRate&rsquo;s 2013 report 
</p>
<p>showed a growth of 18% of the MIV microfinance portfolio in 2012.
</p>
<p>Despite the growth this portfolio there has been a discrepancy between the offer-
</p>
<p>ing of microfinance services and the alleged need or desire for financial services 
</p>
<p>coming from the underserved communities. At yearend 2012, more than 204&nbsp;mil-
</p>
<p>lion microfinance clients, of whom 82% are female, made use of microfinance in 
</p>
<p>more than 85 countries. The annual growth rate of clients amounted in the first 
</p>
<p>decade of the millennium to approximately 20%.7
</p>
<p>The microfinance landscape has been divided into three tiers. Tier 1 consists of 
</p>
<p>mature, financially sustainable, large and highly transparent MFIs. Tier 2 is made up 
</p>
<p>of small or medium sized, slightly less mature MFIs that are, or are approaching

</p>
<p>profitability, while tier 3 comprises immature and unsustainable start-up MFIs or 
</p>
<p>small NGOs. A recent survey of the microfinance market showed that nearly 1200 
</p>
<p>MFIs&nbsp;&ndash; approximately 70% of all MFIs worldwide&nbsp;&ndash; fell into the tier 3 category.8 
</p>
<p>Only 108 MFIs&nbsp;&ndash; representing 7% of the market&nbsp;&ndash; were considered tier 1 institu-
</p>
<p>tions. Table&nbsp; 19.2 provides an overview of the demarcation of the three types of 
</p>
<p>MFIs.
</p>
<p> Microfinance Investors
</p>
<p>Investors in microfinance are divided into three groups: (a) governments and devel-
</p>
<p>opment finance institutions (DFIs), (b) institutional investors, and c) NGOs and 
</p>
<p>other retail investors. Governments and DFIs are public investors; the others are 
</p>
<p>private. Together these investors have allocated an amount of microfinance that 
</p>
<p>topped US$ 25bn in 2011.9 Of this funding 60% came from local actors, while 40% 
</p>
<p>was cross-border.10 DFIs and multilateral organizations, like the World Bank, IFC 
</p>
<p>and EBRD, provided more than half of all foreign investments whereas institutional

10 A distinction is made between NGOs and Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs) on one 
side and banks on the other. The latter received substantially more foreign investments. There were 
also regional differences. Latin America and the Caucasus attracted most foreign investments, 
while South Asia, Africa and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) were clearly lagging.

</p>
<p>investors contributed significantly to the growth of microfinance in the last few 
</p>
<p>years&nbsp;&ndash; particularly in the area of private equity investments. This group of institu-
</p>
<p>tional investors included international banks, pension funds, and insurance compa-
</p>
<p>nies. The impressive growth figures have sometimes been interpreted as a sign of a 
</p>
<p>maturing microfinance. In addition, it has been used as an argument for demonstrat-
</p>
<p>ing the attractiveness of microfinance for institutional and other &lsquo;finance first&rsquo; inves-
</p>
<p>tors&nbsp;&ndash; at a time the jury was still out. Microfinance has gone through a &ldquo;process of 
</p>
<p>transformation from a sector dominated by a mission-driven ethos to one respond-
</p>
<p>ing to the needs and interests of private capital&rdquo;.11 Somewhere during the middle of 
</p>
<p>the first decade of the new millennium the impression started to take root that micro-
</p>
<p>finance was socially and financially attractive. Microfinance was believed to have 
</p>
<p>the potential of adding value to institutional investors in terms of attractive risk- 
</p>
<p>adjusted returns, social value and a low correlation with other asset classes. It did 
</p>
<p>not take long to correct this view as being na&iuml;ve and even detrimental to the poor. 
</p>
<p>The price for getting access to finance was high, as both investors and borrowers 
</p>
<p>were soon to find out, and very often for good reasons. Sometimes it was too high&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>leading to social unrest and protest. Examples came from the No Pago movement in

Although loan sizes differ from one microfinance borrower to another there is no data available on 
the Average Loan Size (ALS) per category. Even within these tiers major differences occur. So take 
a Tanzanian &lsquo;tier 1&rsquo; microfinance provider that categorizes all loans below 25,000 USD as micro-
finance. With such a wide range of loans no overall ALS is published. The bank uses an ALS for 
70% of its portfolio&nbsp;&ndash; referring to the lower end of the market&nbsp;&ndash; which is 1400 USD.

</p>
<p> ACTIAM Impact Investing
</p>
<p> The Trend Towards Responsible Investments
</p>
<p>The start of the new millennium sparked the beginning of a new wave of socially 
</p>
<p>responsible investing (SRI). In the twentieth century SRI particularly focused 
</p>
<p>on social, ethical, and environmental policies, practices&nbsp; &ndash; and to a lesser extent 
</p>
<p>performance&nbsp;&ndash; of multinational corporations. Following the IT-bubble&nbsp;&ndash; which to a 
</p>
<p>large extent demonstrated some clear shortcomings in the governance of compa-
</p>
<p>nies&nbsp; &ndash; the SRI-debate shifted. Governance-issues took centre stage, opening up 
</p>
<p>opportunities for institutional investors to enter the space. In 2004 Mercer and 
</p>
<p>UNEP-FI coined the term Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) to replace 
</p>
<p>Social, Ethical and Environmental (SEE). The notion of governance was much 
</p>
<p>more acceptable to institutional investors facing their fiduciary responsibility 
</p>
<p>towards their beneficiaries. The shift became even more relevant to investors when 
</p>
<p>research demonstrated that improved corporate governance would result in financial 
</p>
<p>outperformance. As a result non-financial issues were integrated in the fundamental 
</p>
<p>financial analyses of companies.
</p>
<p>In the financial bull market that followed the IT-crisis, the institutional investment 
</p>
<p>community was open to a host of innovative investments that looked for excellent 
</p>
<p>financial and non-financial returns. In this environment ACTIAM&nbsp;&ndash; a medium-sized 
</p>
<p>Dutch asset manager&nbsp; &ndash; stepped up its initiatives to become &lsquo;The Responsible 
</p>
<p>Investor&rsquo;. In itself, that was not something new for the company. In the 1980s 
</p>
<p>the company integrated social and environmental factors in the process of stock 
</p>
<p>selection on behalf of a Dutch ethical bank. In 2006 the company decided to inte-
</p>
<p>grate ESG-criteria in the entire investment process&nbsp;&ndash; broadening the scope from

the ACTIAM funds were not confronted with investors reclaiming their invested capital.

<p>stock selection to the selection of all assets.16 The process was guided by the 
</p>
<p>ACTIAM Fundamental Investment Principles (FIPs), which were based on the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Global Compact and relevant international treaties. The idea was 
</p>
<p>that the asset manager would not prioritise its own morality or that of its investors, 
</p>
<p>but would take international conventions, treaties and agreements as its benchmark 
</p>
<p>that were issued by authoritative organisations like the UN, ILO or OECD.&nbsp;The FIPs 
</p>
<p>refer to (the avoidance of) violations of human rights, labour rights, corruption, 
</p>
<p>controversial weapons, environmental protection, and client and product integrity.
</p>
<p>The core of the ACTIAM&rsquo;s responsible investment approach was to avoid or 
</p>
<p>exclude very serious violations of its principles, while it juxtaposed this strategy 
</p>
<p>with an attempt to improve the performance of its investments. To an outsider it may 
</p>
<p>seem odd to want to avoid only very serious violations of one or more principles. As 
</p>
<p>a result, it could occur that ACTIAM condoned mild forms of child labour, human 
</p>
<p>rights violations, corruption or environmental degradation&nbsp; &ndash; and actually that is 
</p>
<p>what happened. Every investor faced&nbsp;&ndash; and faces&nbsp;&ndash; this dilemma when allocating 
</p>
<p>assets. The reason is that large chunks of the investment universe of large cap com-
</p>
<p>panies, nearly per definition, were&nbsp;&ndash; and are&nbsp;&ndash; involved in some sort of activity that 
</p>
<p>is socially, ethically or environmentally undesirable. It is for this reason that 
</p>
<p>ACTIAM invested in engagement with companies involved in undesirable activities 
</p>
<p>or behaviour, but that were not seen as the worst offenders.17 By focusing on the 
</p>
<p>gradual integration of ESG-factors in its portfolio management and on engagement 
</p>
<p>ACTIAM was saying two things. First, the organisation expressed its concern for 
</p>
<p>the social, environmental and governance side of investing. But secondly, it clearly 
</p>
<p>stated it was in the business of investing&nbsp;&ndash; not in one of excluding&nbsp;&ndash; with the excep-
</p>
<p>tion of serious violators of its principles. We should not be misled by the idea that 
</p>
<p>avoiding undesirable practices changes anything to the occurrence of undesirable or 
</p>
<p>reprehensible practices. The problem simply moves from one investor to another&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>that is, to an investor who remains committed to the company, the country or the 
</p>
<p>project that others avoid. The investee will not be impacted by an investor&rsquo;s decision 
</p>
<p>to divest when there is sufficient liquidity in the market willing to invest in the 
</p>
<p>investee. This was and still is a key issue for institutional investors.
</p>
<p> Launching Two Microfinance Funds
</p>
<p>Apart from the avoidance of harm&nbsp;&ndash; which is basically what the investment princi-
</p>
<p>ples were all about&nbsp;&ndash; ACTIAM also wanted to make a positive contribution through 
</p>
<p>its investments. For that reason it launched its first institutional microfinance fund 
</p>
<p>in 2007: the ACTIAM Institutional Microfinance Fund (AIMF). With assets under 
</p>
<p>management of approximately &euro;160mn the launch was very successful. Soon after, 
</p>
<p>16 There were two exceptions: emerging market equity and hedge funds. The first dealt with a lack 
of reliable data available on ESG policies and performance. The second dealt with a general diffi-
culty to assess their social, environmental and governance policies, practices and performance.
17 Only producers of cluster munitions, land mines and atomic, biochemical and chemical weapons 
are immediately excluded. Engagement with these companies usually does not have much sense.

</p>
<p>a second fund followed in 2008. The ACTIAM Institutional Microfinance Fund II 
</p>
<p>raised an amount of capital comparable to the first fund. Both funds were non-listed 
</p>
<p>mutual funds open to professional investors only. At the time the exclusive focus on 
</p>
<p>pension funds, insurance companies and professional asset managers was quite 
</p>
<p>unique. The funds are closed-end&nbsp;&ndash; leading to a situation in which ACTIAM Impact 
</p>
<p>Investing actively participates in the fiduciary responsibility of the pension funds, 
</p>
<p>insurance companies and professional asset managers on whose behalf it invests.
</p>
<p> A Different Business Model
</p>
<p>The fiduciary responsibility of ACTIAM&rsquo;s investors referred to their duty to invest 
</p>
<p>the capital in the best interest of their beneficiaries. Practically speaking this meant 
</p>
<p>that the investors were looking for market-rate returns. They considered themselves 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;finance first&rsquo; investors18&nbsp;&ndash; as opposed to foundations, family offices and High Net 
</p>
<p>Worth Individuals (HNWIs) who are usually referred to as &lsquo;impact first&rsquo; investors. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, also institutional investors would want to look for investment oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities that led to a world worth living in&nbsp;&ndash; then, now and in the future. It is pre-
</p>
<p>cisely this &lsquo;double dividend&rsquo; the ACTIAM Institutional Microfinance Funds were 
</p>
<p>targeting. To serve its investors in an environment that continuously raised the bar 
</p>
<p>regarding the application of professional investment standards ACTIAM Impact 
</p>
<p>Investing developed an innovative business model. That is, ACTIAM operated&nbsp;&ndash; and 
</p>
<p>still operates&nbsp;&ndash; as fund manager on behalf of the fund participants, while leaving the 
</p>
<p>selection and monitoring of the investments up to an independent investment advi-
</p>
<p>sor. ACTIAM, therefore, was responsible for structuring the fund, fund governance, 
</p>
<p>investment decision-making, monitoring the investment advisor and constant com-
</p>
<p>munication and reporting vis-&agrave;-vis its participants. The investment advisor took 
</p>
<p>care of sourcing the investment deals, due diligence, writing the investment pro-
</p>
<p>posal and monitoring the MFIs once the ACTIAM Investment Committee decided 
</p>
<p>to invest. For both funds ACTIAM selected Developing World Markets (DWM) 
</p>
<p>from Stamford, Connecticut as its investment advisor. By creating this structure and 
</p>
<p>dividing responsibilities between itself and its investment advisor the fund manager 
</p>
<p>maximised the chances of working in the interest of both the investors and the 
</p>
<p>investees in a cost-effective way. The structure contributed, for instance, to the pre-
</p>
<p>vention of &lsquo;deal blindness&rsquo;&nbsp; &ndash; a not uncommon characteristic among investment 
</p>
<p>managers deciding on deals they sourced themselves. The division of labour also 
</p>
<p>meant that the best skills were working to provide maximum result in each step of 
</p>
<p>the process. ACTIAM employed portfolio managers and relationship managers 
</p>
<p>18 Elsewhere I have argued that instead of focusing only on financial returns institutional investors 
can also be seen as &lsquo;professional first&rsquo; investors. They apply professional standards to their invest-
ment processes. Investees&nbsp;&ndash; whether direct or through funds or mandates&nbsp;&ndash; have to comply with 
these standards in order to selected. See Hummels, H. &ldquo;Impact Investing through Advisers and 
Managers who Understand Institutional Client Needs&rdquo;, in WEF, From Ideas to Practice, Pilots to 
Strategy. Practical Solutions and Actionable Insights on How to Do Impact Investing, Geneva, 
December 2013, 40&ndash;42.

</p>

</p>
<p>microfinance market. DWM employed specialists familiar with sourcing, analysing 
</p>
<p>and monitoring deals on the ground.
</p>
<p> Investments
</p>
<p>Since inception the first ACTIAM Institutional Microfinance Fund has made more 
</p>
<p>than 256 loans to 123 microfinance institutions for a total amount of &euro;591mn.19 
</p>
<p>Fund II has provided a total of &euro;260mn through 184 loans to 99 MFIs. Finally, the 
</p>
<p>funds took equity stakes in 6 MFIs. The loans and equity investments have mainly 
</p>
<p>been disbursed to MFIs in South America, Central Asia and the Caucasus, and 
</p>
<p>South and South East Asia. Africa was clearly lagging behind due to high invest-
</p>
<p>ment risks. In an environment where fixed income investment returns declined sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly in the developed world between 2007 and 2015 the ACTIAM Funds 
</p>
<p>returned somewhere around 5% annually to their investors&nbsp;&ndash; net of management 
</p>
<p>fees and of other costs.
</p>
<p> Performance of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Funds
</p>
<p>Looking back on more than 6&nbsp;years of microfinance investments, what has been 
</p>
<p>achieved? Did ACTIAM Impact Investing succeed in creating a decent market-rate 
</p>
<p>return for its investors, while at the same time creating social value for the MFIs 
</p>
<p>ACTIAM invested in and their clientele?
</p>
<p>From a financial point of view the ACTIAM Institutional Microfinance Funds 
</p>
<p>performed quite well. At the end of 2012 both funds provided a return to the inves-
</p>
<p>tors of somewhat over 6% on the debt part of the portfolio&nbsp;&ndash; net of costs and net of 
</p>
<p>fees. Compared to the SMX Index,20 which returned 4.05% in 2012,21 that leads to 
</p>
<p>an outperformance of over 200 basis points (bps). But what can be said about the 
</p>
<p>social performance? Did both funds actually live up to the expectation of creating 
</p>
<p>added value for the micro-entrepreneurs the ultimately want to assist in getting 
</p>
<p>access to finance.
</p>
<p>As Fig.&nbsp;19.1 shows the first fund reached some 1.2&nbsp;million borrowers over a 
</p>
<p>period of 6&nbsp; years. Outreach, however, is not the most important indicator of 
</p>
<p>19 This includes rollovers. In total the AIMFs have provided more that &euro;850mn in debt to MFIs, 
which is an indication of the long-term focus of both funds. With a 7&nbsp;year investment horizons the 
originally committed capital of &euro;320mn has been made productive&nbsp;&ndash; on average&nbsp;&ndash; for approxi-
mately 2.5&ndash;3&nbsp;years per loan. Due to the fact that many loans were rollovers ACTIAM was able to 
establish a long-term relationship with its MFIs.
20 The SMX is created by Symbiotics. Currently the following MIVs are part of the index: 
ResponsAbility Global Microfinance Fund, BlueOrchard Microfinance Fund, Dual Return Fund 
Vision Microfinance, Wallberg Global Microfinance Fund, and Triodos SICAV II&nbsp; &ndash; Triodos

<p>non- financial success if it is not directly related to serving the needs of the poor. 
</p>
<p>Products and services offered to MFI-clients have to be instrumental in providing 
</p>
<p>access to finance in a responsible way. Inter alia, they have to meet criteria 
</p>
<p>regarding client protection, transparency and good governance. ACTIAM 
</p>
<p> particularly focused on implementing some of the most elements in the Client 
</p>
<p>Protection Principles and the Principles for Investors in Inclusive Finance (PIIF). 
</p>
<p>So while the cover of the Eye4Impact reported on outreach the backside informed 
</p>
<p>investors on improvements in the focus and the management of MFIs as Fig.&nbsp;19.2 
</p>
<p>demonstrates.
</p>
<p>As the Eye4Impact illustrates, enlarging capital for Western pensionados while 
</p>
<p>enhancing the opportunities of the poor to get access to finance can go hand in 
</p>
<p>hand&nbsp;&ndash; even though there is still plenty room for improvement. The next section 
</p>
<p>will point out that this unfortunately is not always the case in microfinance across 
</p>
<p>the globe.

</p>
<p> Creating Shared Value
</p>
<p>Mohammad Yunus saw microfinance as an example of creating shared value &lsquo;avant 
</p>
<p>la lettre&rsquo; by developing a range of financial products that enhance the business 
</p>
<p>opportunities, capabilities and skills of poor micro-entrepreneurs. Porter and 
</p>
<p>Kramer could have referred to microfinance if they would have wanted to point to 
</p>
<p>an opportunity to increase society&rsquo;s productivity and the development of a new mar-
</p>
<p>ket. &ldquo;The concept of shared value&rdquo;, they argue, &ldquo;recognizes that societal needs, not 
</p>
<p>just conventional economic needs, define markets&rdquo;.22 That was precisely what Yunus 
</p>
<p>had in mind when he provided access to financial services in order to alleviate pov-
</p>
<p>erty and offer an alternative to the so-called &lsquo;loan sharks&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>When ACTIAM launched its first two funds, microfinance institutions across the 
</p>
<p>globe were looking for foreign direct investment capital to grow their businesses 
</p>
<p>and to provide access to finance to poor people.23 At that time most of this capital 
</p>
<p>was still supplied by NGOs and DFIs. The rise of microfinance investment vehicles 
</p>
<p>(MIVs), bringing private capital to the market, was seen as a welcome addition to 
</p>
<p>the opportunities for MFIs to attract funding.
</p>
<p>At the time of their launch the funds aimed to expand &ldquo;the total pool of economic 
</p>
<p>and social value&rdquo;24 by adding two characteristics that were quite innovative. In the 
</p>
<p>first place the funds were exclusively open to institutional investors. Secondly, they 
</p>
<p>were closed end funds that allowed for the provision of loans in&nbsp;local currencies. 
</p>
<p>Both elements offered MFIs a significant advantage. The commitment by institu-
</p>
<p>tional investors to accept a tenor of at least 7&nbsp;years contributed to the credibility of 
</p>
<p>the microfinance sector. Apparently, institutional investors like pension funds or 
</p>
<p>insurance companies were willing to provide capital to micro-entrepreneurs who 
</p>
<p>had no or only very few assets&nbsp;&ndash; albeit via MFIs. In addition, the funds provided an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to provide loans with a longer tenor and in&nbsp;local currencies&nbsp;&ndash; leaving 
</p>
<p>some of the currency risk with the investors.
</p>
<p> Bad Moon Rising
</p>
<p> Assisting the&nbsp;Poor?
Since 2007 a number of crises emerged across the world that were related to micro-
</p>
<p>finance. With the benefit of hindsight we can conclude that most crises were not 
</p>
<p>incidents but foreseeable accidents waiting to happen. They were the result of a mix 
</p>
<p>of ingredients that turned out to be poisonous to at least some of the microfinance 
</p>
<p>22 Porter, M.&nbsp;E. and Kramer, M.&nbsp;R., &lsquo;Creating Shared Value: How to reinvent capitalism and unleash 
a wave of innovation and growth&rsquo;, in Harvard Business Review, 2011, Vol. 89 (1), p.&nbsp;65
23 The demand was triggered, among other reasons, by the changes in political and regulatory envi-
ronments, which stimulated large-scale access to finance. In India, as a result of regulatory reforms 
the number of microfinance clients nearly doubled between 2005 and 2010. See Srinivasan, N., 
Microfinance: The State of The Sector Report. New Delhi: SAGE Publications, 2010.

</p>
<p>borrowers. Before the 2006 &lsquo;Krishna crisis&rsquo; emerged in Andhra Pradesh25 (AP) the 
</p>
<p>financial markets in the developed and the developing had a positive outlook on the 
</p>
<p>potential of microfinance. Even after this crisis the optimistic sentiment persisted. 
</p>
<p>As was explained in section &ldquo;ACTIAM Impact Investing&rdquo; vast amounts of foreign 
</p>
<p>capital were flowing into the market leading to an environment based on conditions 
</p>
<p>that did not contribute to the creation of a sustainable microfinance market. The flow 
</p>
<p>of capital allowed MFIs to grow very rapidly on a commercial basis. Money became 
</p>
<p>an easy to get commodity without borrowers being sufficiently aware of the condi-
</p>
<p>tions and the consequences of borrowing too much money. Interest rates were high 
</p>
<p>and sometimes excessive, MFIs forced borrowers to save and used unethical recov-
</p>
<p>ery practices, and entrepreneurs ended up with having 2, 3 or even more loans.
</p>
<p>The Krishna crisis may have provided the first sign that microfinance was more 
</p>
<p>than a tool to alleviate poverty and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t the last. Analysts, like Ramesh 
</p>
<p>Arunachalam, pointed out that microfinance gradually became a risk as a result of 
</p>
<p>the lack of appropriate regulation and oversight, combined with improper business 
</p>
<p>conduct by loan officers and debt collectors. The potential risks not only became 
</p>
<p>manifest in India, but also in Mexico and Nicaragua.
</p>
<p>Mexico Compartamos Banco is the largest MFI in Mexico. In 2007 the board of 
</p>
<p>what at that time still was a non-governmental organisation, decided to go public. 
</p>
<p>By floating an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Mexican Stock Exchange the 
</p>
<p>bank netted a little over US$400mn for its shareholders. In 2&nbsp;years time, then CEO 
</p>
<p>Maria Otero received a compensation of more than 2 million USD.&nbsp;At the same time 
</p>
<p>the poor were paying annualized interest rates of more than 100% on a loan.
</p>
<p>Nicaragua In January 2009 the Movimiento de Productores, Comerciantes y 
</p>
<p>Microempresarios de Nueva Segovia blockaded the Panamerican Highway. The 
</p>
<p>protesters introduced the phrase that would echo in Nicaraguan and even interna-
</p>
<p>tional politics for more than 1&nbsp;year: &lsquo;No Pago! No Pago!&rsquo;26 The No Pago Movement, 
</p>
<p>consisting of some 10.000 members, was largely fuelled by complaints that MFIs 
</p>
<p>charge interest rates that are too high, leaving borrowers swamped in unmanageable 
</p>
<p>debt. The movement lobbied for the passage of a debt relief law that would fix the 
</p>
<p>maximum chargeable interest rate at 12%. On 1 October 2009 protesters scored a 
</p>
<p>major victory when legislators signed a bill supporting the passing of such a law. 
</p>
<p>The proposal gives debtors an interest-free, 6-month grace period and up to four to 
</p>
<p>5&nbsp;years to fully repay their loans.27
</p>
<p>25 Krishna is a district in Andhra Pradesh. In 2006 the state shut 50 branches of two of India&rsquo;s larg-
est microfinance institutions for charging &ldquo;usurious interest rates&rdquo; and &ldquo;forced loan recovery&rdquo; 
practices.
26 No Pago can best be translated as &ldquo;I do not pay&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>shall within thirty days from the date of commencement of this Ordinance, apply for

</p>
<p>diligence and system of effecting recovery and list of persons authorized for con-
</p>

</p>
<p>MFIs, operating at the commencement of this Ordinance or intending to start the 
</p>
<p>business of lending money to SHGs, after the commencement of this Ordinance, 
</p>
<p>shall grant any loans or recover any loans without obtaining registration under this 
</p>
<p>Ordinance from the Registering Authority.&rdquo;29 These two paragraphs from the ordi-
</p>
<p>nance that the government of Andhra Pradesh passed on 15 October 2010 caused a 
</p>
<p>shock in the Indian&nbsp;&ndash; and global&nbsp;&ndash; microfinance community. The ordinance entailed 
</p>
<p>that MFIs with pending registration had to cease operations in Andhra Pradesh 
</p>
<p>immediately. They were not allowed to collect loans and interest payments, which 
</p>
<p>had a significant impact on their liquidity. The ordinance followed reports on uneth-
</p>
<p>ical recovery practices and suicides as a result of client over-indebtedness.
</p>
<p>Add to these examples the accusation in the spring of 2013 that microfinance 
</p>
<p>investment vehicles made use of profit shifting and avoid taxes,30 and the impression 
</p>
<p>is easily created that microfinance is rather poisonous&nbsp;&ndash; for investors and for micro-
</p>
<p>finance borrowers. It led MS Sriram at the Indian Institute of Management in 
</p>
<p>Ahmedabad to conclude: &ldquo;a fairy-tale had turned into a nightmare&rdquo;.31 It is important 
</p>
<p>to note that ACTIAM funds were not invested in Compartamos Banco or in India at 
</p>
<p>the time of the AP crisis. The funds were, however, invested in a Nicaraguan MFI 
</p>
<p>that went bankrupt as a result of the crisis. Ultimately, the investors paid the bill for 
</p>
<p>the bankruptcy of the MFI, although the cost was rather limited.
</p>
<p> Consequences for&nbsp;Institutional Investors
</p>
<p>The various cases of negative publicity were quite contrary to the expectations of 
</p>
<p>investors&nbsp;&ndash; to put it mildly. Microfinance always had been seen as a force for (moral) 
</p>
<p>good and many believed&nbsp;&ndash; in accordance with Yunus&rsquo; belief&nbsp;&ndash; it contributed to pov-
</p>
<p>erty reduction. It had produced a Nobel Prize winner and it had reached over 100 
</p>
<p>million borrowers in 2006. Hugh Sinclair, a microfinance critic, pointed to the

performed a miracle. (&hellip;) We were no longer a fringe activity; we had 100 million clients. 
We were superheroes, apparently, and the microfinance sector even had a Nobel Peace Prize 
under its belt. (&hellip;) Sam clarified. &ldquo;I would like to propose a round of applause for us, those

been possible, and I think you deserve a round of applause.32

<p>In Halifax, the Krishna crisis had already taken shape, although the crises&nbsp; in 
</p>
<p>Mexico and Nicaragua were still concealed in an unknown future. In the years fol-
</p>
<p>lowing the summit even the most ardent proponents of microfinance were convinced 
</p>
<p>of the necessity of change. The dream was over. Nevertheless, there was no reason 
</p>
<p>to throw out the baby with the bath water because some MFIs fell prey to mission 
</p>
<p>drift and shifted their attention towards commercializing their operations in an 
</p>
<p>unethical way. There was still a need for access to finance for the poor&nbsp;&ndash; albeit in 
</p>
<p>ways that match the needs and the abilities of poor to handle a microloan and all that 
</p>
<p>comes with it. According to the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and 
</p>
<p>the World Bank (2010) around 2.7 billion people still lacked access to formal finan-
</p>
<p>cial services implying a capital requirement of some USD 250&ndash;300&nbsp;billion. Some of 
</p>
<p>that money could come from domestic investors, but not all of it. Foreign direct 
</p>
<p>investments remained an important source of funding for microfinance institu-
</p>
<p>tions&nbsp;&ndash; be it with the right specs that made it possible for MFIs to offer microfinance 
</p>
<p>loans, saving and insurance in a commercial, but responsible way. Providing access 
</p>
<p>to finance through microfinance products and services is relatively expensive&nbsp;&ndash; par-
</p>
<p>ticularly in the not so densely populated rural areas. But that should never lead to 
</p>
<p>usury, to mandatory savings (certainly when practiced without giving fair compen-
</p>
<p>sation to the client), or to the use of oppressive recovery practices.
</p>
<p> Creating Shared Value as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Normative Challenge?
</p>
<p>In this book De los Reyes and Scholz challenge the framework of creating shared 
</p>
<p>value (CSV) to adequately address normative issues and corporate social responsi-
</p>
<p>bility (CSR). The authors take issue with Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s approach and their 
</p>
<p>idea that the &ldquo;essential test that should guide CSR is not whether a cause is worthy 
</p>
<p>but whether it presents an opportunity to create shared value&rdquo;. More in particular, 
</p>
<p>they argue that CSV &ldquo;is ill-suited to handle common managerial scenarios where 
</p>
<p>profitability cuts into social welfare or vice versa&rdquo;33 Business will not regain its

</p>
<p>legitimacy by simply creating shared value and stimulating economic growth for a 
</p>
<p>community and those who are part of that community. More is needed, and that 
</p>
<p>particularly includes an integration of normative analysis in the CSV framework to 
</p>
<p>address issues of redistribution and responsibility. Even though CSV may be a nec-
</p>
<p>essary requirement to align societal and business interests, De los Reyes and Scholz 
</p>
<p>continue, it is not a sufficient component for business to redeem societal trust and 
</p>
<p>win back its legitimacy. To that extent the authors offer a conceptual framework 
</p>
<p>called SWONT, an abbreviation of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Norms 
</p>
<p>and Threats.
</p>
<p>The authors have a point in addressing the normative quality of the CSV frame-
</p>
<p>work, which is relevant for this chapter. ACTIAM Impact Investing considered itself 
</p>
<p>to be an enlightened asset manager, consciously serving both the interests of the 
</p>
<p>investees as well as those of the investors. As was shown in the previous paragraph 
</p>
<p>it faced several ethical challenges and opportunities in its attempt to provide capital 
</p>
<p>to MFIs in a responsible way. In this respect, it acted in line with Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>CSV framework. So what can be said about the moral compass that CSV offered to 
</p>
<p>ACTIAM? Was it sufficient? Should it have been supplemented by an explicit nor-
</p>
<p>mative analysis as part of the strategic planning process? In this section I will spend 
</p>
<p>a few words on the relevance of the discourse between CSV and SWONT, discuss-
</p>
<p>ing the approach that ACTIAM took in the next section.
</p>
<p> Creating Value Versus Redeeming Legitimacy
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s claim that business can redeem corporate legitimacy by imple-
</p>
<p>menting CSV more of less has become the framework&rsquo;s Achilles heel. A more mod-
</p>
<p>est approach in which the authors simply would have demonstrated that CSV 
</p>
<p>contributes to winning back public confidence and trust, would likely have pre-
</p>
<p>vented an argument on the (lack of) ethical quality of the framework in its current, 
</p>
<p>pronounced form as I hope to demonstrate in the remainder of this article. Even 
</p>
<p>though Porter and Kramer suggest that CSV can help business to regain its societal 
</p>
<p>legitimacy, the framework not about awarding or allocating moral praise for solving 
</p>
<p>society&rsquo;s problems. It simply is the intelligent business attempt to create economic 
</p>
<p>and social value for business and society by listening and responding to the needs of 
</p>
<p>society. It sees and conceptually frames societal problems as business opportunities. 
</p>
<p>CSV is, therefore, all about common (business) sense&nbsp;&ndash; whatever social motives the 
</p>
<p>owners and managers may have had when they started their CSV activities. The 
</p>
<p>question then arises whether De los Reyes and Scholz aren&rsquo;t exaggerating their 
</p>
<p>argument? Aren&rsquo;t they missing the point that managers, operating in an open and 
</p>
<p>dynamic society and focusing on simultaneously creating sustainable long-term 
</p>
<p>value for the business and for society, will incorporate normative arguments in their 
</p>
<p>decision-making? It may be true that in Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s CSV framework ethics 
</p>
<p>has become a caricature to the extent that it lacks guidance for managers dealing 
</p>
<p>with difficult ethical challenges and choices that cannot be explained and answered 
</p>
<p>by a reference to the creation of shared value. The question is, however, does this 
</p>
<p>19 Microfinance as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Shakespearean Tragedy: The&nbsp;Creation of&nbsp;Shared Value, While&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>412
</p>
<p>perceived lack of guidance require adding a normative analysis to the existing 
</p>
<p>SWOT-model? Wouldn&rsquo;t such an addition fail to appreciate that managers who are 
</p>
<p>focused on long-term value creation for business and society are savvy when it 
</p>
<p>comes to integrating ethics&nbsp;&ndash; even if they do not receive explicit guidance from 
</p>
<p>Porter and Kramer? Managers are challenged by customers, NGOs, politicians, 
</p>
<p>media, academics and, not at least, their own employees regarding issues of sustain-
</p>
<p>ability and ethics. In a global business environment&nbsp;&ndash; which is the environment De 
</p>
<p>los Reyes and Scholz implicitly put centre stage&nbsp;&ndash; these are and have to be alert and 
</p>
<p>responsive to the needs of society as a conditio sine qua non, with or without the 
</p>
<p>support of the CSV framework. The value of Porter and Kramer&rsquo;s framework rests 
</p>
<p>in their constant focus on opportunities for business to turn society&rsquo;s problems into 
</p>
<p>corporate action that is both profitable and societally valuable. Those opportunities 
</p>
<p>can be found everywhere across the globe&nbsp; &ndash; even in situations that seem quite 
</p>
<p>unlikely today. It is the strength of the CSV framework that even when dealing with, 
</p>
<p>for instance, the poorest of the poor, there are ways in which a business approach to 
</p>
<p>solving society&rsquo;s problems can be beneficial to the poor and to society in a respon-
</p>
<p>sible way. The case of ACTIAM Impact Investing demonstrates that&nbsp; &ndash; even in 
</p>
<p>absence of ethical guidance from the CSV framework&nbsp;&ndash; no SWONT model was 
</p>
<p>required to conduct business in a responsible way.
</p>
<p> A Clear Challenge
</p>
<p>The sustainability of ACTIAM Impact Investing&rsquo;s business model was tested during 
</p>
<p>the microfinance crises mentioned previously. Even though the asset manager was 
</p>
<p>not directly involved in two of the three crises, it certainly faced some tough ques-
</p>
<p>tions from investors, colleagues and the outside world. Microfinance&rsquo;s honeymoon 
</p>
<p>came to a sudden and unexpected end when it appeared to have negative social 
</p>
<p>effects on the lives of poor and low-income people&nbsp;&ndash; in addition to the value it cre-
</p>
<p>ated in allowing microfinance clients to have access to financial service and better 
</p>
<p>manage their financial needs.
</p>
<p>This unexpected development caused concern among (institutional) investors. In 
</p>
<p>an environment that was confronted with the aftermath of the global financial cri-
</p>
<p>sis&nbsp;&ndash; with limited risk budgets available for niche products&nbsp;&ndash; institutional investors 
</p>
<p>became somewhat wary to make high-risk investments in developing countries. The 
</p>
<p>investment opportunities needed to be large enough to justify the high costs involved 
</p>
<p>in microfinance investments. In addition, the fiduciary responsibility towards their 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries required pension funds and insurance companies to generate market- 
</p>
<p>rate returns. But most of all, they saw a reputation risk arising in making impact 
</p>
<p>investments in developing markets in general and microfinance investments in 
</p>
<p>particular.
</p>
<p>The ACTIAM Institutional Microfinance Funds were not confronted with an out-
</p>
<p>flow of capital as a result of the events taking place across the globe because they 
</p>
<p>were closed-end funds. Investors were simply not able to reclaim their investments. 
</p>
<p>Despite this characteristic of the funds that kept all investors on board, ACTIAM 
</p>
<p>H. Hummels</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>413
</p>
<p>faced the reputation issue heads on. In tackling the reputation issue the organisa-
</p>
<p>tion&rsquo;s development investment arm did not operate in a moral void. On the contrary, 
</p>
<p>the fundamental investment principles and ACTIAM&rsquo;s culture of being a responsi-
</p>
<p>ble investor provided clear guidance.
</p>
<p>For that reason ACTIAM adopted the Client Protection Principles, which were 
</p>
<p>launched by the SMART Campaign in 2009. MFIs have to comply with the princi-
</p>
<p>ples and with social covenants that are part of the investment contract in order to get 
</p>
<p>funding&nbsp;&ndash; even if that would lower investment returns. A second initiative worth 
</p>
<p>mentioning was the launch of the Principles for Investors in Inclusive Finance (PIIF) 
</p>
<p>in January 2011. In signing the principles, investors commit to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Expanding the range of financial services available to low-income people;
</p>
<p>&bull; Integrating client protection into all their policies and practices;
</p>
<p>&bull; Treating their investees fairly, with clear and balanced contracts, and dispute 
</p>
<p>resolution procedures;
</p>
<p>&bull; Integrating ESG factors into their policies and reporting;
</p>
<p>&bull; Promoting transparency in all their operations;
</p>
<p>&bull; Pursuing balanced long-term returns that reflect the interests of clients, retail 
</p>
<p>providers and end investors; and
</p>
<p>&bull; Working together to develop common investor standards on inclusive finance.
</p>
<p>ACTIAM played a significant role in stimulating its investors to become a signa-
</p>
<p>tory of the PIIF and to adopt the principles. In addition, the asset manager also 
</p>
<p>pursued the observance and realisation of the principles. The adoption of the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples has had an impact on the acceptance of new MFIs as clients of the microfi-
</p>
<p>nance funds and the monitoring of already existing clients. Measures that were 
</p>
<p>taken consisted of, inter alia:
</p>
<p>&bull; The use of benchmarks to assess acceptable Return on Assets and Return on 
</p>
<p>Equity levels,
</p>
<p>&bull; Implementing a stricter focus on remuneration and incentives of MFI manage-
</p>
<p>ment and staff as part of the due diligence and monitoring of MFIs. No ethically 
</p>
<p>questionable incentives&nbsp;&ndash; such as (excessive) bonuses for bringing in new clients 
</p>
<p>or collecting interest and loan payments&nbsp;&ndash; will be condoned,
</p>
<p>&bull; Reinforcing policies and analysis regarding the risk of over-indebtedness in port-
</p>
<p>folio countries,
</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting the launch of credit bureaus in developing countries.
</p>
<p>Finally, ACTIAM became a member of the Social Performance Taskforce 
</p>
<p>(SPTF), initiated a round table with other MIVs to discuss the development in 
</p>
<p>highly saturated markets like Peru and Cambodia, and led the study on microfinance 
</p>
<p>and tax avoidance by the Dutch National Platform for Inclusive Finance (NPM).
</p>
<p>In order to manage and mitigate the (reputation) risks, which had emerged over 
</p>
<p>time in the microfinance space, ACTIAM increased and improved investor com-
</p>
<p>munication. In order to educate investors, the asset manager outlined its view on 
</p>
<p>19 Microfinance as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Shakespearean Tragedy: The&nbsp;Creation of&nbsp;Shared Value, While&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>414
</p>
<p>social value creation in a separate paper. In addition, the organisation issued regular 
</p>
<p>newsletters in which relevant topics were addressed. Finally, ACTIAM organised 
</p>
<p>field trips to MFIs for its participants. These 3&ndash;4&nbsp;day excursions had the character 
</p>
<p>of a study trip34 in which MFI visits were combined with meetings with sector 
</p>
<p>representatives, national banks, and, of course, MFI clients.
</p>
<p> Good Business Sense
</p>
<p>Despite this negative effect on the cost of the operations, ACTIAM continued focus-
</p>
<p>ing on reducing the risks for its investors, investees and microfinance borrowers. 
</p>
<p>Not only was this decision the result of the ACTIAM culture and its investment 
</p>
<p>principles, it was also motivated by the idea of good business sense. Ultimately, 
</p>
<p>ACTIAM wanted to contribute to building a strong and responsible financial sector 
</p>
<p>in which access to finance for poor and low-income people is fully integrated. One 
</p>
<p>can only achieve this aim by focusing on the long run. Integration of financial ser-
</p>
<p>vices for poor and low-income clients takes time&nbsp;&ndash; much time. Only those asset 
</p>
<p>managers will be around in the decades to come that ultimately have the patience 
</p>
<p>and the business sense to see the social needs and objectives of end clients, MFIs 
</p>
<p>and investors as part and parcel of their strategic business model&nbsp;&ndash; and act on it.
</p>
<p>The case demonstrates that a strategy focused on creating shared value does not 
</p>
<p>necessarily preclude a focus on normative ethics. In an open and dynamic society 
</p>
<p>and with a clear focus on long-term shared value creation managers will be sensitive 
</p>
<p>to the moral claims of the stakeholders. The primary reason for ACTIAM Impact 
</p>
<p>Investing&rsquo;s management to be responsive to the social needs of microfinance clients 
</p>
<p>was not a sense of moral obligation&nbsp; &ndash; although the ethical appeal coming from 
</p>
<p>NGOs and the media resonated well with management&nbsp;&ndash; but the anxiety of investors 
</p>
<p>to be exposed to reputation damage. The leading question for management has, 
</p>
<p>therefore, been:
</p>
<p>What can we do when our products and services meet society&rsquo;s responsibility standards to 
prevent being challenged by our clients and the outside world when the sector in which we 
operates is falling from grace?
</p>
<p> Shakespeare&rsquo;s Tragedy
</p>
<p>Present-day stories about &lsquo;No Pago&rsquo;, Compartamos Banco, or the Andhra Pradesh 
</p>
<p>crises could have provided Shakespeare with interesting material for modern drama. 
</p>
<p>Whether reading Julius Caesar, Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, Henry VIII and not 
</p>
<p>to forget Richard III, self-interest and betrayal are common characteristics in his 
</p>
<p>34 To avoid misperceptions about the intentions of the asset manager, the trips were paid for by the 
investors. Inviting participants was not a facilitation payment to induce investors to become loyal 
supporters of the funds.

</p>
<p>historical plays and tragedies. Not always for the wrong reasons, as Marcus Brutus 
</p>
<p>shows in Julius Caesar. Brutus is truly concerned with Julius Caesar&rsquo;s ambition to 
</p>
<p>turn the Roman republic into a monarchy under his rule. Brutus teams up with con-
</p>
<p>spiring Roman Senators to assassinate Caesar. Despite being erroneous about 
</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s motives and intentions, both friend and foe considered Brutus to be &lsquo;a 
</p>
<p>noble man&rsquo;. He acted for the good of Rome.
</p>
<p>Mohammad Yunus may have felt like Julius Caesar when microfinance became 
</p>
<p>a tool that could turn itself against the interests of the poor. Yunus&rsquo; idea of microfi-
</p>
<p>nance becoming an omnipotent instrument for poverty alleviation turned into a 
</p>
<p>nightmare in some cases. Against the background of the potential downsides of 
</p>
<p>microfinance, ACTIAM Impact Investing faced some challenges when it simultane-
</p>
<p>ously tried to serve the interests of the poor and of its investors. High investor returns 
</p>
<p>resulted in undesirable social outcomes, which had to be balanced with the provi-
</p>
<p>sion of sufficient capital to provide access to finance for poor and low-income peo-
</p>
<p>ple. Too strong a focus on eliminating poverty by offering low-cost loans and 
</p>
<p>technical assistance to microfinance institutions would, on the other hand, result in 
</p>
<p>an outflow of (institutional) capital in the long run.
</p>
<p>ACTIAM found a middle of the road approach by attracting foreign capital to 
</p>
<p>improve the access to finance for poor and low-income clients to increase their abil-
</p>
<p>ity to better manage their financial affairs. This obviously required a vision and a 
</p>
<p>focus on the asset manager&rsquo;s responsibility in terms of the prevention of excessive 
</p>
<p>interest rates, over-indebtedness, or unethical recovery practices. In addition, 
</p>
<p>ACTIAM and its investors were determined to contribute to a professionalization of 
</p>
<p>the sector. This could, for instance, be done by speaking out on the necessity of 
</p>
<p>regulation, promoting transparency, supporting the creation of credit bureaus, or 
</p>
<p>building an environment in which microfinance could develop into a profitable sus-
</p>
<p>tainable financial practice. Poor and low-income people are willing to pay for high- 
</p>
<p>quality services when the contractual conditions are fair.
</p>
<p>Serving the interest of both business and society is in need of managers&nbsp;&ndash; operat-
</p>
<p>ing within a CSV framework&nbsp;&ndash; who demonstrate to be streetwise in an ever- changing 
</p>
<p>business environment. They need to be&nbsp;&ndash; and very often they are&nbsp;&ndash; savvy in incor-
</p>
<p>porating the needs of their stakeholders in a dialectic relationship between business 
</p>
<p>and its&nbsp;environment. This means that the CSV framework implicitly incorporates 
</p>
<p>normative elements that Porter and Kramer disregard. On the other hand, there is 
</p>
<p>not need for adding the &lsquo;N&rsquo; to the SWOT-analysis. Analysis and discourse on social, 
</p>
<p>ethical and environmental issues that managers meet along the way of implement-
</p>
<p>ing their strategy, are part and parcel of the conditions of doing business in a modern 
</p>
<p>economy.35 The example of ACTIAM demonstrates that, with an open mind and a 
</p>
<p>35 Part of the problem with De los Reyes and Scholz&rsquo; approach is that they fail to clarify what nor-
mative analysis and discourse entails and what it adds to the toolbox of socially, ethically, or 
environmentally streetwise managers. A contribution that does provide relevant support is Mitchell, 
Agle and Wood&rsquo;s Theory of Stakeholder identification and salience, focusing on power, urgency 
and legitimacy of stakeholders and their claims. See Mitchell, R.K., Agle, B.R. and Wood, D.J.,

<p>20&lsquo;Ecomagination&rsquo; at Work: GE&rsquo;s Sustainability Initiative
S. S.&nbsp;George and&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Regani
</p>
<p>Ecomagination is GE&rsquo;s commitment to address challenges such as the need for cleaner, 
more efficient sources of energy, reduced emissions, and abundant sources of clean water. 
And we plan to make money doing it. Increasingly for business, &ldquo;green&rdquo; is green (Jeffrey 
Immelt, Chairman and CEO of General Electric, in 2005).1
</p>
<p>Ecomagination is a milestone for a number of reasons, including that it&rsquo;s a long-term 
commitment with specific targets made at the company&rsquo;s highest level. GE has taken this 
process seriously and done its homework to make sure its claims and goals are credible 
(Joel Makower, sustainability consultant, in 2005).2
</p>
<p> Towards a&nbsp;Cleaner Environment
</p>
<p>In March 2006, General Electric Company (GE), one of the largest business 
</p>
<p> conglomerates in the world, announced that it had developed a prototype version of 
</p>
<p>a new apparatus that could manufacture hydrogen through electrolysis.3 According 
</p>
<p>to the company&rsquo;s estimates, the hydrogen produced with this equipment would cost 
</p>
<p>around $3.04 per kilogram to manufacture&nbsp;&ndash; considerably less than the $8.0 per 
</p>
<p>kilogram it cost to manufacture using conventional processes in 2006.
</p>
<p>Although the device was still at an early stage of development, it was believed 
</p>
<p>that it could play an important role in the future, as in the early 2000s, hydrogen was

</p>
<p>had launched, or were working on developing, vehicles that would run on hydrogen 
</p>
<p>(Refer to Exhibit 20.1 for a list of some hydrogen-powered vehicles).
</p>
<p>Hydrogen-powered vehicles were environment-friendly as they did not emit

<p>of fossil fuels. However, in the early 2000s, a major limitation to the use of hydro-
</p>
<p>gen was that it was considerably more expensive than traditional fuels. Therefore, if 
</p>
<p>GE&rsquo;s apparatus caught on, it was expected to help make hydrogen- powered vehi-
</p>
<p>cles popular, by bringing the price of a kilogram of hydrogen down to the price of a 
</p>
<p>gallon of gasoline.4
</p>
<p>The hydrogen production project was a part of GE&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ecomagination&rsquo; initiative, 
</p>
<p>launched in May 2005. Ecomagination, promoted as GE&rsquo;s commitment to sustain-
</p>
<p>able development, was a large- scale program aimed at making the company a more 
</p>
<p>responsible corporate citizen. It covered among other things, GE&rsquo;s efforts to enhance 
</p>
<p>its investment in developing sustainable technologies, and increase its revenues 
</p>
<p>from sustainable products, while lowering emissions and improving energy effi-
</p>
<p>ciency at its production plants. According to GE, Ecomagination would help the 
</p>
<p>company―imagine and build innovative technologies that [would] help customers 
address their environmental and financial needs and help GE grow5.
</p>
<p>GE was only one of the many large companies that had invested in sustainability 
</p>
<p>in the early 2000s. Notable among the others were Novartis AG, Unilever Plc., 
</p>
<p>BMW AG, and energy and petroleum majors ExxonMobil Corp., Chevron Corp., 
</p>
<p>and BP (formerly British Petroleum). According to analysts, sustainability initia-
</p>
<p>tives were especially relevant for large companies that had a huge impact on the 
</p>
<p>economy as well as the environment. However, they added that most large compa-
</p>
<p>nies were only indulging in &lsquo;greenwash&rsquo; when they talked about their sustainability 
</p>
<p>efforts. But GE&rsquo;s results in the first year after the launch of Ecomagination seemed 
</p>
<p>to indicate that it was one of the few large corporations that were genuinely commit-
</p>
<p>ted to sustainability.
</p>
<p> Background
</p>
<p>GE&rsquo;s origins can be traced back to 1879, when Thomas Alva Edison (Edison) 
</p>
<p>invented the first successful incandescent electric lamp. Edison was an entrepreneur 
</p>
<p>as well as an inventor, and had started several small businesses dealing with power 
</p>
<p>stations, wiring devices, and appliances during the late 1870s and 1880s. In 1890, 
</p>
<p>4 Between January 2006 and October 2006, the retail price of one gallon of gasoline ranged from 
$2.25 to $3.0&nbsp;in the US. (from www.wikipedia.com).

</p>
<p>he brought all these businesses together and combined them under the Edison 
</p>
<p>General Electric Company (EGEC).
</p>
<p>EGEC merged with the Thomas-Houston Electric Company7&nbsp;in 1892 to form 
</p>
<p>GE.&nbsp;The newly formed GE was headquartered in New&nbsp;York. In 1894, Edison gave 
</p>
<p>way to Charles Coffin (Coffin) as the CEO of GE.&nbsp;Coffin licensed out the electric 
</p>
<p>bulb technology to other companies, thus consolidating GE&rsquo;s position in the emerg-
</p>
<p>ing lighting industry. Coffin also created a formal hierarchy in the company and 
</p>
<p>organized GE&rsquo;s various businesses in a systematic manner, arranging each unit 
</p>
<p>around a product line. He was also credited with setting up financial control systems 
</p>
<p>at GE.
</p>
<p>GE was one of the earliest companies to introduce a benefits program for employ-
</p>
<p>ees. In the 1920s and 1930s, under the leadership of Gerard Swope (Swope), GE 
</p>
<p>launched several progressive industrial relations initiatives, setting up new policies 
</p>
<p>to give employees pensions, bonuses, stock purchase options, profit sharing, and 
</p>
<p>group insurance. It also became the first company to establish an unemployment 
</p>
<p>pension plan, which guaranteed laid-off workers a stipend of $7.50 per week for a 
</p>
<p>period of 10&nbsp;weeks after the layoff.
</p>
<p>However, Charles Wilson, who succeeded Swope in 1940, undid most of his 
</p>
<p>predecessor&rsquo;s good work, and industrial relations took a turn for the worse under his 
</p>
<p>leadership. In 1948, there was a major strike, which caused a rift between the blue 
</p>
<p>collar workers and the top management at the company.
</p>
<p>By the 1950s, GE had become a major industrial conglomerate with interests in 
</p>
<p>a variety of businesses. But growth brought with it its own problems. From the 
</p>
<p>beginning, GE had been organized like a holding company, with a few executives at 
</p>
<p>the headquarters monitoring the activities of the various businesses. But for routine 
</p>
<p>monitoring, each business unit enjoyed great autonomy. Over the years, the heads of 
</p>
<p>individual businesses became powerful, and began operating their units like inde-
</p>
<p>pendent businesses with little reference to GE&rsquo;s strategic objectives.
</p>
<p>After Ralph Cordiner (Cordiner) became CEO in 1958, he embarked on a 
</p>
<p>company- wide restructuring program to bring discipline to GE.&nbsp;To obtain more con-
</p>
<p>trol over the various businesses, he strengthened bureaucracy within the company. 
</p>
<p>Cordiner created a team of GE executives, outside consultants, and management 
</p>
<p>experts to develop strategies to streamline the company&rsquo;s management practices. He 
</p>
<p>was also responsible for setting up GE&rsquo;s management training center at Croton-on- 
</p>
<p>Hudson in New&nbsp;York, popularly known as the Crotonville School (Crotonville6, to 
</p>
<p>train future GE leaders.
</p>
<p>GE grew rapidly in the 1960s under the leadership of Fred Borch, who became 
</p>
<p>the CEO in 1964. Borch was responsible for introducing the concept of Strategic 
</p>
<p>Business Units (SBUs)7, and he created 46 SBUs within the company in the late 
</p>
<p>6 The Thomas-Houston Electric Company was founded in 1879 by Elihu Thomson and Edwin 
J.&nbsp;Houston. It was a competitor to EGEC, until the merger of the two companies.
7 Under the &lsquo;Number One Number Two&rsquo; strategy GE had to be one of the top two players in every 
segment in which it operated. If any business failed to meet this criterion, it was shut down or sold 
off.

</p>
<p>1960s. He also added several new businesses like computers, nuclear power, and 
</p>
<p>aircraft engines to GE&rsquo;s portfolio.
</p>
<p>Reginald Jones (Jones) succeeded Borch in 1972. Jones invested heavily in office 
</p>
<p>automation in a bid to increase productivity, and took some strategic decisions 
</p>
<p>which involved strengthening promising businesses units like plastics and divesting 
</p>
<p>in the unproductive computer businesses. Under him, GE became one of the most 
</p>
<p>powerful conglomerates in the world.
</p>
<p>A significant phase in GE&rsquo;s history began in 1981, when Jack Welch (Welch) 
</p>
<p>became the CEO.&nbsp;Under Welch&rsquo;s leadership, GE adopted its well-known Number 
</p>
<p>One Number Two strateg8. Six Sigma was also launched at the company during his 
</p>
<p>tenure. By the time he stepped down in 2001, Welch was one of the most visible 
</p>
<p>leaders that GE and corporate America had ever had.
</p>
<p>In mid-2001, Jeffrey Immelt (Immelt) succeeded Welch. Immelt became CEO 
</p>
<p>during one of the most difficult phases in business history. Within days of his taking 
</p>
<p>over, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks occurred. This was followed by cor-
</p>
<p>porate scandals at Enron Corporation and Tyco International Corporation, as a con-
</p>
<p>sequence of which investors began to view large corporations and their top 
</p>
<p>management with a degree of distrust and suspicion.
</p>
<p>As one of the largest corporations in the US and the world, GE too was affected 
</p>
<p>by the changes in the business environment. Adding fuel to the fire was a report by 
</p>
<p>Bill Gross, manager of Pacific Investment Management Co., one of the largest bond 
</p>
<p>funds in the world. In his report, Gross criticized GE&rsquo;s opaque finances, and accused 
</p>
<p>the company of inflating earnings through acquisitions and cheap debt rather than 
</p>
<p>through organic growth. GE&rsquo;s share price fell drastically after the report was 
</p>
<p>published.
</p>
<p>Following this, Immelt instituted several changes at GE aimed at winning back 
</p>
<p>investor confidence. He announced that the management would take steps to 
</p>
<p>improve the quality of governance at the company. He also revised the compensa-
</p>
<p>tion packages of all the top executives at GE to link compensation to company 
</p>
<p>performance. The Ecomagination program launched in 2005 was also a part of this 
</p>
<p>broad initiative.
</p>
<p>In the fiscal year ended December 2005, GE posted revenues of more than $149 
</p>
<p>billion (Refer to Exhibit 20.2 for GE&rsquo;s annual financials). It also ranked among 
</p>
<p>the largest employers in the world, employing more than 300,000 people in its vari-
</p>
<p>ous business units. At the end of 2005, GE had six core business units, and was the 
</p>
<p>biggest manufacturer of power plants, jet engines, locomotives, and medical equip-
</p>
<p>ment worldwide9 (Refer to Exhibit 20.3 for GE&rsquo;s core business units).

several management techniques in strategic planning.

</p>
<p> Past Controversies
</p>
<p>In all its years of existence, GE had not been known as a particularly 
</p>
<p> environment- friendly company. In fact, as a large company with interests in several 
</p>
<p>industrial outfits, it had for long been one of the biggest corporate polluters in the 
</p>
<p>US.&nbsp;While the company had built up a strong reputation for delivering outstanding 
</p>
<p>returns to shareholders, it had lagged behind on the social responsibility front. Over 
</p>
<p>the years, GE had been criticized on several occasions for its lack of social respon-
</p>
<p>sibility. But, it had chosen to ignore its critics, choosing profitability and financial 
</p>
<p>performance over social and environmental objectives.
</p>
<p>One of the biggest environmental controversies involving GE related to the pol-
</p>
<p>lution of the Hudson and Housatonic rivers in the US.&nbsp;In the early 1980s, GE was 
</p>
<p>accused of dumping several million of pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
</p>
<p>into stretches of the two rivers from its factories located along their banks.
</p>
<p>PCBs are chemical compounds with low water solubility and environmental 
</p>
<p>degradability, and studies have shown that people exposed to them could suffer 
</p>
<p>several adverse effects. The US Environment Protection Agency (EPA)10 had banned 
</p>
<p>their production in 1977, after the US Congress passed the Clean Water Act that 
</p>
<p>year. Since most of GE&rsquo;s PCB dumping had been done before 1972, when the sub-
</p>
<p>stance was not banned by law, the company contended that it was not responsible 
</p>
<p>for the sediments already present in the rivers. Environmentalists, however, argued 
</p>
<p>that the dangerous nature of PCBs had been well known even before the law was 
</p>
<p>passed, and that GE had acted irresponsibly in dumping the chemicals in the 
</p>
<p>rivers.
</p>
<p>In 1980, the US Congress passed another Act called the Comprehensive 
</p>
<p>Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, popularly known as the 
</p>
<p>Superfund law. This Act made companies retroactively responsible for the clean-up 
</p>
<p>of all identified Superfund sites (industrialized areas heavily contaminated with 
</p>
<p>hazardous waste that was discharged before the clean-water regulations came into 
</p>
<p>force). GE, however, continued to fight the law, even going to the extent of filing a 
</p>
<p>suit challenging the EPA&rsquo;s right to enforce the clean-up law. The suit reportedly cost 
</p>
<p>GE millions of dollars. Welch was known for being especially passionate about this 
</p>
<p>issue, going so far as to declare in public that living in PCB contaminated areas was 
</p>
<p>in no way hazardous to health.11
</p>
<p>In 2002, Christine Todd Whitman, the EPA Administrator at the time, issued a 
</p>
<p>ruling that gave GE two options&nbsp;&ndash; an out of court settlement, or fines of up to $2 
</p>
<p>billion (almost three times the estimated cost of remediation).12 GE, led by Immelt, 
</p>
<p>agreed to settle the matter out of court, and promised to pay for the clean-up. 
</p>
<p>10 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or sometimes USEPA) is an agency of the federal 
government of the United States charged with protecting human health and with safeguarding the 
natural environment: air, water, and land. The EPA began operating on December 2, 1970, when it 
was established by President Richard Nixon. (www.wikipedia.com).

</p>
<p>However, despite agreeing to bear the costs of the clean-up, GE was pilloried by 
</p>
<p>environmentalists for stalling the proceedings for several years.
</p>
<p>In 2005, GE entered into an agreement with the EPA and the US Department of 
</p>
<p>Justice to begin removing contaminated sediment in a two stage clean-up of the 
</p>
<p>Hudson River at an estimated cost of around $750 million.13 The project was sched-
</p>
<p>uled to begin in 2007. (An agreement to clean up the Housatonic river had been 
</p>
<p>drawn up in 1999).
</p>
<p> Remedial Attempts
</p>
<p>Although GE had traditionally been a company that gave more importance to profit-
</p>
<p>ability than to social responsibility, the business environment in the early 2000s 
</p>
<p>demanded that companies look beyond financial objectives. This was also the time 
</p>
<p>when the Kyoto Protocol14 was a much discussed subject, and environmental con-
</p>
<p>cerns were increasingly being raised at global forums like the G815 and WTO16 
</p>
<p>meetings. Besides, consumers and investors had become more environmentally 
</p>
<p>conscious than before, which made it all the more important for companies to con-
</p>
<p>sider environmental interests in all their operations.
</p>
<p>Corporate social responsibility became a subject of greater focus at GE in 2002. 
</p>
<p>In that year, a large team of GE&rsquo;s high-potential executives attended a training ses-
</p>
<p>sion at Crotonville on corporate social responsibility. As a part of the training, the 
</p>
<p>executives visited several companies that had confronted social and environmental 
</p>
<p>issues in the past, like IBM Corp., BP, Eli Lilly, and Nike Corp. They also interacted 
</p>
<p>extensively with regulators, activists, and investors, who had an interest in corporate 
</p>
<p>social responsibility.
</p>
<p>During the course of their training, the executives found that although GE was 
</p>
<p>highly respected for its investment value, management quality, and operations, it 
</p>
<p>ranked low on the social responsibility front. If GE were to maintain its position in

Climate Change concerning the issues related to global warming. The countries that ratify the 
protocol commit themselves to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse 
gases, or to engage in emissions trading if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. The 
treaty was negotiated in December 1997 and came into force on February 16, 2005. As of October 
2006, there were 166 signatories to the treaty, but the US Congress had not yet ratified it. (www.

</p>
<p>the global economy, immediate steps had to be taken to correct this perception about 
</p>
<p>the company.
</p>
<p>In 2002, Immelt appointed Bob Corcoran, a long-time GE employee, as the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s first vice president for corporate citizenship. GE also launched several global 
</p>
<p>initiatives aimed at making the company more socially responsible. For instance, in 
</p>
<p>the early 2000s, GE started conducting audits on its suppliers (especially those in 
</p>
<p>the developing parts of the world) to ensure that they complied with globally 
</p>
<p>accepted labor, environmental, health, and safety standards in their operations.
</p>
<p>Immelt also restructured GE&rsquo;s business portfolio to include more companies 
</p>
<p>operating in emerging industries. Over the early 2000s, Immelt acquired Enron 
</p>
<p>Wind (one of the few successful companies in Enron&rsquo;s business portfolio), water 
</p>
<p>management companies Ionics Inc. and Osmonics Inc., and AstroPower Inc., the 
</p>
<p>biggest manufacturer of solar energy equipment in the US.&nbsp;In 2004, GE also invested 
</p>
<p>in a new coal technology called Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC), 
</p>
<p>which filtered out greenhouse gases and pollutants when coal was burned for energy, 
</p>
<p>making the process cleaner. The filtered gases were usually sequestered&rsquo; under-
</p>
<p>ground where they could not cause environmental pollution17.
</p>
<p>According to company insiders, GE always ensured that it had enough contacts 
</p>
<p>in the appropriate political circles to gauge where the US Congress was heading on 
</p>
<p>environmental issues, especially with regard to the Kyoto Protocol carbon emis-
</p>
<p>sions. This led GE to the conclusion that acquiring interests in emerging businesses 
</p>
<p>made good business sense, as it would put the company in a better position to meet 
</p>
<p>the challenges of the future. If and when the Congress imposed carbon emission 
</p>
<p>restrictions, GE would be able to offer products that met environmental needs, thus 
</p>
<p>obtaining a competitive advantage. For instance, if carbon restrictions were imposed 
</p>
<p>in the US, eco-friendly aircraft engines would be in demand. Therefore, GE&rsquo;s invest-
</p>
<p>ment in eco-friendly aircraft engines would prepare it to meet the need.
</p>
<p>GE made several corporate level changes in the early 2000s. In 2002, the com-
</p>
<p>pany added more independent directors to its board. Key board committees like the 
</p>
<p>audit, compensation, and nominating committees, were made free of insiders18. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, company-wide changes were made in executive compensation to 
</p>
<p>make it more transparent.
</p>
<p>Talking about GE&rsquo;s increased emphasis on good corporate citizenship, Immelt 
</p>
<p>said,―The world&rsquo;s changed. Businesses today aren&rsquo;t admired. Size is not respected. 
There&rsquo;s a bigger gulf today between haves and have-nots than ever before. It&rsquo;s up to 
</p>
<p>us to use our platform to be a good citizen. Because not only is it a nice thing to do, 
</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a business imperative19. In late 2004, GE was listed on the Dow Jones 
</p>
<p>Sustainability Index.20

financial performance of companies which met detailed criteria for environmental, social, and 
financial sustainability. At the time GE debuted on it, around 300 other companies were listed on 
the various indexes.

<p>20 &lsquo;Ecomagination&rsquo; at Work: GE&rsquo;s Sustainability Initiative</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>424
</p>
<p> From Imagination to&nbsp;Ecomagination
</p>
<p>GE announced the Ecomagination project in May 2005. The project&rsquo;s name was a 
</p>
<p>play on GE&rsquo;s corporate slogan &lsquo;Imagination at Work&rsquo;. Announcing the launch, 
</p>
<p>Immelt said that business was no longer a zero-sum game&nbsp;&ndash; things that are good for 
</p>
<p>the environment are also good for business.‖ He added that GE was embarking on 
this initiative―not because it is trendy or moral, but because it will accelerate [eco-
nomic] growth.21
</p>
<p>The broad objective of Ecomagination was to meet such environmental chal-
</p>
<p>lenges as the need for clean water, renewable energy, and reduced emissions. 
</p>
<p>According to Immelt, Ecomagination aimed to―focus our (GE&rsquo;s) unique energy, 
technology, manufacturing, and infrastructure capabilities to develop tomorrow&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>solutions such as solar energy, hybrid locomotives, fuel cells, lower-emission air-
</p>
<p>craft engines, lighter and stronger materials, efficient lighting, and water purifica-
</p>
<p>tion technology.22
</p>
<p>The slogan for Ecomagination was―green is green‖ (where the second &lsquo;green&rsquo; 
referred to the color of the US dollar bills). The slogan implied that being 
</p>
<p>environment- conscious would have significant financial benefits for business. GE 
</p>
<p>felt that it was especially well equipped to help customers meet the environmental 
</p>
<p>challenges of the future as it had a broad range of products that could cater to all 
</p>
<p>their needs. The company was also clear that Ecomagination had been launched not 
</p>
<p>for philanthropic purposes, but to create new business opportunities for GE.
</p>
<p>GE worked on Ecomagination for almost year before launching the initiative. 
</p>
<p>The company worked with GreenOrder, Inc. (GreenOrder), a New&nbsp;York-based firm, 
</p>
<p>which provided business consulting on environmental strategy and marketing, to 
</p>
<p>develop the blueprint for the project. GreenOrder started out by helping GE identify 
</p>
<p>a clear vision and mission for the project. After this, the broad standards were laid 
</p>
<p>down. GE and GreenOrder defined the standards of the project as those that―
improve customers&rsquo; operating performance or value proposition and significantly 
</p>
<p>and measurably improve customers&rsquo; environmental performance.23
</p>
<p>GE then identified 17 products of the company that met the standards to qualify 
</p>
<p>for Ecomagination projects.24 Among other things, the Ecomagination products 
</p>
<p>included energy conserving household appliances, wind turbines, a hybrid electric- 
</p>
<p>diesel locomotive, a Lexan film that replaced conventional paint, lighting products, 
</p>
<p>water infrastructure, advanced materials, a fuel-efficient jet engine, and energy 
</p>
<p>generation.

</p>
<p>After the products had been identified, GE, with GreenOrder&rsquo;s help, created 
</p>
<p>scorecards for each. These scorecards were used to quantify and benchmark the 
</p>
<p>environmental benefits of each of the Ecomagination products against competitors&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>comparable products, regulatory standards, and the products&rsquo; past environmental 
</p>
<p>performance. The scorecards also integrated these measures with product claims, 
</p>
<p>which GE used in its promotions. The product claims essentially laid out the bene-
</p>
<p>fits that GE&rsquo;s customers might obtain by using Ecomagination products. Some 
</p>
<p>examples of GE&rsquo;s product claims are given in Table&nbsp;20.1.
</p>
<p> Targets and&nbsp;Expected Benefits
</p>
<p>With the help of the scorecards, GE was able to lay down clear targets for each of 
</p>
<p>its Ecomagination products. In its media releases, GE identified &lsquo;four distinct and 
</p>
<p>measurable behaviors&rsquo; in Ecomagination25:
</p>
<p>&bull; Doubling the investment on developing cleaner technologies from $700 million 
</p>
<p>in 2004 to $1.5 billion by 2010.
</p>
<p>&bull; Doubling revenues from environment-friendly products and services from $10 
</p>
<p>billion in 2004 to at least $20 billion in 2010.
</p>
<p>&bull; Achieving a 1% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 through 
</p>
<p>incorporating cleaner practices at the company, and helping customers reduce 
</p>
<p>emissions by offering them more environment-friendly products. (GE also 
</p>
<p>planned to reduce the intensity of its emissions by 30% by 2008. The company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>energy efficiency was to be improved by 30% by 2012. Both the targets were 
</p>
<p>compared to 2004. In the normal course, GE&rsquo;s absolute emissions were forecast 
</p>
<p>to increase by 40% by 2012.)
</p>
<p>&bull; Keeping the public informed about the progress of Ecomagination on an annual 
</p>
<p>basis. These targets were developed in consultation with the Washington DC 
</p>
<p>based World Resources

</p>
<p>If every U.S. household owning a washer not qualified by ENERGY STAR were to replace it 
with a GE PROFILE HARMONY washer, we could save enough water each year to fill nearly 
400,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and consumers could save more than $1 billion in 
water bills
</p>
<p>Through the use of GE&rsquo;s installed wind turbines, as much as 11.4 million tons of greenhouse 
gases will not be emitted each year, which is roughly equal to keeping nearly two million cars 
off the road
</p>
<p>Compared to locomotives manufactured 20&nbsp;years ago, many of which are still in use, the GE 
EVOLUTION Series locomotive reduces pollution by producing 83% fewer particulates and 
60% fewer nitrogen oxide emissions

<p>Institute (WRI). WRI was headed by Jonathan Lash (Lash), who had been 
</p>
<p> chairman of the Council on Sustainable Development in President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>government. WRI and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
</p>
<p>had developed the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which GE used to track and report 
</p>
<p>internal emissions. Lash was extremely optimistic about the success of 
</p>
<p>Ecomagination and described Immelt as a Visionary
</p>
<p>He said that as a large company, GE was in a position to influence other companies to fol-
low in its footsteps on the sustainability issue. By delivering on the commitment that they 
have announced GE will demonstrate that we can decouple economic growth from growth 
in greenhouse gas emissions, said Lash26 (Refer to Exhibit 20.4 for some of GE&rsquo;s 
Ecomagination products).
</p>
<p> Promotions
</p>
<p>GE promoted Ecomagination widely through its advertisements and other promo-
</p>
<p>tion campaigns, as a part of its &lsquo;keeping the public informed&rsquo; objective. To announce 
</p>
<p>the launch of the project, the company took out eight-page advertising inserts in 
</p>
<p>prominent American newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, The New&nbsp;York Times, 
</p>
<p>and The Washington Post. The advertisements consisted of a small picture and little 
</p>
<p>copy, with most of the page left blank (Refer to Exhibits 20.5(A) and 20.5(B) for a 
</p>
<p>screenshot from GE&rsquo;s Ecomagination print advertisements).
</p>
<p>GE also aired several television advertisements, the most prominent of which 
</p>
<p>was the &lsquo;Cleaner Coal&rsquo; spot. This advertisement featured models covered in coal 
</p>
<p>dust, shoveling coal in a dingy mine. The voiceover said,―Now, thanks to emissions- 
reducing technologies from GE, the power of coal is getting more beautiful every 
</p>
<p>day.27 Another advertisement showed a baby elephant dancing in the forest to the 
</p>
<p>soundtrack of―Singing in the Rain.28 Some of GE&rsquo;s critics were of the view that 
these advertisements were &lsquo;gimmicky&rsquo;, but according to analysts, they played an 
</p>
<p>important role in creating awareness about the program.
</p>
<p>In May 2005, GE instituted the Ecomagination Leadership Awards to honor the 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s customers who had―demonstrated a commitment in addressing press-
ing environmental challenges, such as water scarcity&nbsp;&ndash; while at the same time con-
</p>
<p>serving energy, addressing safety concerns, and reducing overall operating costs.29 
</p>
<p>In 2005, the Ecomagination Leadership Awards were given to 10 companies (Refer 
</p>
<p>to Exhibit 20.6 for the 2005 Ecomagination Leadership award winners).

</p>
<p> The Results
</p>
<p>GE published its first Ecomagination Report in May 2006, to report the initiative&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>progress in the 1&nbsp; year since its launch. According to the report, revenues from 
</p>
<p>energy efficient and environment-friendly products were $10.1 billion in 2005. 
</p>
<p>Orders for eco-products also nearly doubled to $17 billion in that year.30
</p>
<p>In 2005, GE installed 1,300 wind turbines across the globe, and the wind energy 
</p>
<p>business recorded revenues of $2 billion&nbsp;&ndash; an increase of more than 180% over the 
</p>
<p>revenues in 2004. Sales of GE&rsquo;s EnergyStar certified31 household appliances also 
</p>
<p>topped $1.3 billion.32
</p>
<p>Emissions remained flat over 2005, and because GE saw an increase in revenue, 
</p>
<p>the intensity of the emissions actually decreased. In 2005, GE&rsquo;s emission rate was 
</p>
<p>74.26&nbsp;tons of emissions per million dollars, while in 2004 it had been 82.64&nbsp;tons per 
</p>
<p>million dollars. The lowering of intensity was propelling the company toward its 
</p>
<p>target of actually lowering total emissions by 1% by 2012.33
</p>
<p>Ecomagination was a global initiative, and GE had undertaken several projects 
</p>
<p>outside the US.&nbsp;For instance, in mid-2005, GE announced that it would build a water 
</p>
<p>desalination plant at Algiers, the capital of Algeria, in partnership with the Algerian 
</p>
<p>Government, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Algerian Energy 
</p>
<p>Company. The plant, called the Hamma Water Desalination SpA, was to be Africa&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>largest seawater desalination plant, and was expected to supply potable water to 
</p>
<p>25% of the population of Algiers.34
</p>
<p>Commenting on the progress in the first year of Ecomagination, Immelt said,―
Last year, we said that &lsquo;green can be green&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash; that we would make money helping 
</p>
<p>customers meet their environmental challenges. A year later, we know that green is 
</p>
<p>green, and that it will make a difference on the bottom line for GE investors as cus-
</p>
<p>tomer interest is accelerating.35
</p>
<p>The first Ecomagination Report was made available online, and GE announced 
</p>
<p>that it would plant a tree at its jet engine testing facility in Ohio for each of the first 
</p>
<p>2500 downloads. These trees were expected to offset the effect of the carbon emis-
</p>
<p>sions at the plant.
</p>
<p>According to analysts, one of the critical factors in the success of Ecomagination 
</p>
<p>in its first year was Immelt&rsquo;s commitment to the project. Considering that GE had

</p>
<p>never been a particularly socially responsible company, it was not an easy task for 
</p>
<p>Immelt to change the mindset of the employees. However, he persisted with it, all 
</p>
<p>the while reiterating its benefits to the business.
</p>
<p>A strong link to business objectives was another factor that contributed to the 
</p>
<p>initial success of Ecomagination. Analysts applauded the fact that all the 
</p>
<p>Ecomagination goals were specific and clear. GE had a clear mission and vision for 
</p>
<p>the project, and its targets were aspirational as well as achievable. GE had also 
</p>
<p>undertaken considerable research on identifying the products that qualified for 
</p>
<p>Ecomagination, and benchmarked them against competitors&rsquo; products. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s claims were quite definite in terms of how the products contributed 
</p>
<p>to the environment, and could be backed up by research. The link to business objec-
</p>
<p>tives helped employees see Ecomagination as a long-term objective rather than a 
</p>
<p>temporary fad.
</p>
<p>In 2006, Immelt announced that all of GE businesses, including those that did 
</p>
<p>not come under the purview of Ecomagination, would be evaluated annually on how 
</p>
<p>they contributed to the environment, in addition to regular measures like return on 
</p>
<p>capital.36 This was expected to be a precursor to bringing more GE products under 
</p>
<p>Ecomagination.
</p>
<p> Outlook
</p>
<p>Although the results of the first year prompted GE&rsquo;s detractors to concede that 
</p>
<p>Ecomagination was not a publicity exercise to clean up GE&rsquo;s image, but a serious 
</p>
<p>project to which the company was committed, there was still a fair amount of skepti-
</p>
<p>cism about its success in the long run. For instance, industry observers were inter-
</p>
<p>ested in finding out how GE, which was one of the largest suppliers of coal-fired 
</p>
<p>power plants, nuclear reactors, and jet engines, would extend the Ecomagination 
</p>
<p>initiative from a few projects to a company-wide exercise. It was also observed that 
</p>
<p>sustainability as a corporate strategy worked only if it was made a company-wide 
</p>
<p>initiative. If it remained restricted to a few products, its impact would be limited.
</p>
<p>However, most analysts acknowledged that Ecomagination was a bold move on 
</p>
<p>GE&rsquo;s part. For a company that was known as a laggard on the social responsibility 
</p>
<p>front, GE had made remarkable progress with Ecomagination within the first year 
</p>
<p>itself. They also agreed that when an influential company like GE emphasized sus-
</p>
<p>tainability, it could have far reaching effects, even to the extent of influencing the 
</p>
<p>national government&rsquo;s environmental policies. Immelt reportedly met with several 
</p>
<p>members of the government during the run-up to the launch of Ecomagination. 
</p>
<p>Many took this to be an indication that GE wished to influence the government&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>policies on the environment.37
</p>
<p>In the future, governments around the world were expected to make environmen-
</p>
<p>tal regulations more stringent in keeping with the Kyoto Protocol. GE was thought to

</p>
<p>be preparing for this by increasing its focus on eco-friendly products. Big, long- term 
</p>
<p>successful companies have been able to spot really huge changes and be on the right 
</p>
<p>side of them. Immelt believes he is going to operate in a carbon-constrained world 
</p>
<p>and he will have the technologies that the world wants and needs to buy, said Lash.38
</p>
<p>On the other hand, concerns were expressed over GE&rsquo;s heavy dependence on 
</p>
<p>emerging technologies. Some analysts cautioned Immelt against moving too fast to 
</p>
<p>adopt new technologies as they believed that he could turn out to be wrong about the 
</p>
<p>importance of environmental concerns. They said that if these concerns subsided in 
</p>
<p>the future, or new oil resources were freed up, then GE&rsquo;s products might become 
</p>
<p>irrelevant. They also pointed out that there had been &lsquo;sustainability booms&rsquo; earlier. 
</p>
<p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, several large companies like the Dow Chemical 
</p>
<p>Company and E.&nbsp;I. du Pont de Nemours (DuPont) had invested heavily in sustain-
</p>
<p>able technologies. But by the late 1990s, most of them had had to scale back their 
</p>
<p>investments, as sustainable technologies grew at a much slower pace than had origi-
</p>
<p>nally been predicted.39
</p>
<p>It was also thought that GE&rsquo;s work culture was not one that adapted easily to 
</p>
<p>innovation and product breakthroughs. The Six Sigma driven company culture was 
</p>
<p>extremely metrics-oriented, and worked well for incremental improvements and 
</p>
<p>execution of plans. But when it came to new products with relatively uncertain 
</p>
<p>results, the effect might not be the same, thought analysts.40
</p>
<p>GE, however, claimed that innovation was embedded in the very foundations of 
</p>
<p>the company. Edison had reportedly said,―I never perfected an invention that I did 
not think about in terms of the service it might give to others &hellip; I find out what the 
</p>
<p>world needs, then I proceed to invent.41
</p>
<p>GE was apparently doing the same thing in predicting a need for environment- 
</p>
<p>friendly products and proceeding to develop them through Ecomagination. Talking 
</p>
<p>about the potential of Ecomagination, Lorraine Bolsinger, vice president of 
</p>
<p>Ecomagination at GE said,―We&rsquo;re off to a good start and see even more opportu-
nity&nbsp;&ndash; but we still have a long way to go.42

<p>Exhibit 20.4: Some ecomagination products
</p>
<p>&bull; GE&rsquo;s EVOLUTION Series locomotive is one of the cleanest diesel-electric 
</p>
<p> locomotives ever built. Its 12-cylinder engine generates the same 4400 horse-
</p>
<p>power as its 16-cylinder predecessor. Compared to locomotives built 20&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>ago&nbsp;&ndash; many of which are still in use&nbsp;&ndash; it produces 83% fewer particulates and 
</p>
<p>60% fewer nitrogen oxide emissions while delivering as much as 10% lower 
</p>
<p>lifecycle costs to customers and higher fuel efficiency.
</p>
<p>&bull; GE produces some of the world&rsquo;s most powerful, energy-efficient, cleanest and 
</p>
<p>quietest aircraft engines. GE pioneered the use of composite materials in jet 
</p>
<p>engines. These blades are used in the GE90-115B aircraft engine, the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>most powerful engine. The next generation of engine&nbsp;&ndash; the GEnx engine&nbsp;&ndash; will 
</p>
<p>extend this technical breakthrough to both the composite blades and fan case. 
</p>
<p>With advanced compression and combustion technology, this engine will achieve 
</p>
<p>dramatic gains in fuel efficiency and durability, with significantly lower emis-
</p>
<p>sions than any engine in its class.
</p>
<p>&bull; GE has developed a reusable wire coating for automotive and other uses that is 
</p>
<p>halogen- free, thereby reducing dioxin production during manufacturing. GE&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>NORYL wire coating is up to 25% lighter than current alternatives, which could 
</p>
<p>reduce vehicle weight and help improve gas mileage.
</p>
<p>&bull; GE is leading efforts to develop cleaner coal technologies. The world has nearly 
</p>
<p>200&nbsp;years of coal reserves compared to about 40 for oil and 70 for natural gas. 
</p>
<p>GE&rsquo;s Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology converts coal 
</p>
<p>into a cleaner-burning fuel, which is then burned in a gas turbine combined cycle 
</p>
<p>system to generate electricity. Compared to conventional pulverized coal plants, 
</p>
<p>the process emits less than half of the sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, mercury 
</p>
<p>and particulate matter. If all conventional coal plants operating in the U.S. today 
</p>
<p>had been built with GE&rsquo;s IGCC Cleaner Coal technology, the result would be an 
</p>
<p>annual reduction of nearly 320 million tons of carbon dioxide.
</p>
<p>&bull; GE provides custom filtration and separation solutions for diverse industries, 
</p>
<p>from beverages to manufacturing to pharmaceuticals. GE&rsquo;s advanced membrane 
</p>
<p>technologies help companies reclaim 21 billion gallons of wastewater each year, 
</p>
<p>conserving water and cutting pollution.
</p>
<p>&bull; GE&rsquo;s desalination technology removes salt from brackish or sea water and cre-
</p>
<p>ates fresh water for drinking, irrigation and industrial use. GE&rsquo;s current installed 
</p>
<p>desalination platforms reclaim more than 2 billion gallons of water a day for a 
</p>
<p>variety of purposes&nbsp;&ndash; enough to meet the daily water required by more than 150 
</p>
<p>million people.
</p>
<p>&bull; The GE PROFILE dishwasher with SMARTDISPENSE technology will save deter-
</p>
<p>gent by releasing just the right amount throughout the wash cycle. If every dish-
</p>
<p>washer in the U.S. could be replaced with a GE dishwasher with SMARTDISPENSE 
</p>
<p>technology, it would have the potential to save more than 750,000&nbsp;tons of dishwash-
</p>
<p>ing detergent from being washed down the drain each year.

<p>&bull; GE offers some of the world&rsquo;s most energy-efficient household appliances and 
</p>
<p>lighting products. GE has been named the ENERGY STAR&reg; Partner of the Year 
</p>
<p>by U.S. environmental and energy officials for its commitment to energy- efficient 
</p>
<p>products. GE&rsquo;s compact fluorescent lighting offers energy savings of 70&ndash;75% 
</p>
<p>and lasts up to ten times as long as incandescent bulbs. If every household in the 
</p>
<p>U.S. replaced one 100-watt incandescent light bulb with a GE compact fluores-
</p>
<p>cent bulb equivalent in light output, we would save enough energy over the 
</p>
<p>bulbs&rsquo; lifetime to power more than one million U.S. homes for an entire year.

<p>Exhibit 20.5(B): Text Extracts from the Ecomagination Ad Campaign
</p>
<p>Imagine if we suddenly discovered a new resource. An inexhaustible resource. A 
</p>
<p>readily available resource. One that could help solve the problems of an energy- 
</p>
<p>hungry world. At GE, we think we&rsquo;ve discovered just that. It&rsquo;s imagination. But 
</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s more appropriate to call it Ecomagination. We&rsquo;re putting ideas into action 
</p>
<p>by creating some very forward- looking technologies that does the job with greater 
</p>
<p>fuel efficiency, lower emissions and reduce noise. At the same time, we provide 
</p>
<p>services to help upgrade our customers&rsquo; existing technologies for better environ-
</p>
<p>mental performance. Maybe, in time, we can help make the water a little clearer, the 
</p>
<p>trees a little happier, the sky a little bluer, and the world a little closer to the way it 
</p>
<p>was made. Just imagine it.

<p>Can technology and the environment peacefully coexist? Ecomagination answers 
</p>
<p>yes with the Evolution Series locomotive. Who would have dreamed that a 
</p>
<p>415,000&nbsp; lb. diesel locomotive could have an environmental conscience? The 
</p>
<p>Evolution locomotive is designed to be more fuel efficient and more powerful while 
</p>
<p>it exceeds stringent EPA emissions standards, making the air cleaner and clearer for 
</p>
<p>all. No small technological feat. This is the &lsquo;little&rsquo; engine that could. And will.
</p>
<p>&bull; Are we letting one of the world&rsquo;s cleanest and most renewable power sources slip 
</p>
<p>through our fingers? Here&rsquo;s where we apply a little Ecomagination. GE Energy 
</p>
<p>is one of the world&rsquo;s leading suppliers of wind energy products. Not only is wind 
</p>
<p>energy renewable and easy to harvest, but one GE wind turbine can produce 
</p>
<p>enough electricity for about 400 homes each year. Well worth a few bad hair 
</p>
<p>days.

<p> The Challenge
</p>
<p>The World Bank1 projects that the developing world&rsquo;s annual rate of growth will 
</p>
<p>average a staggering 4.7%&nbsp; &ndash; nearly double the 2.3% for the developed world&nbsp; &ndash; 
</p>
<p>between 2011 and 2025, and will account for 50% of global consumption by 2050. 
</p>
<p>McKinsey estimates that annual consumption in the emerging markets will top $30 
</p>
<p>trillion by 2025, up from $12 trillion in 2010. Where these markets today represent 
</p>
<p>36% of global GDP, they are likely to account for 70% between now and 2025.2

</p>
<p>Alongside this enormous potential are equally enormous social and environmen-
</p>
<p>tal challenges, especially as more and more of the population clusters in crowded 
</p>
<p>urban centers. Growing confirmation of global warming is increasing the threat of 
</p>
<p>widespread drought and flooding.3 Estimates are that 40%&nbsp;&ndash; more than 2 billion 
</p>
<p>hectares&nbsp;&ndash; of the world&rsquo;s agricultural land are being degraded,4 and two-thirds of the 
</p>
<p>world will be living in water stressed conditions&nbsp;&ndash; both factors that will have supply 
</p>
<p>chain implications for most companies. Children will continue to die from malnutri-
</p>
<p>tion and diarrhea, even as more developed countries deal with higher levels of child 
</p>
<p>obesity and its health consequences.
</p>
<p>PWC5 meanwhile, states that the environment is a &ldquo;market driver,&rdquo; offering 
</p>
<p>opportunities for revenue growth and value creation, especially in the rapidly 
</p>
<p>expanding emerging markets.
</p>
<p>Today, less than 17% of the revenues from the top 100 multinationals (MNCs) 
</p>
<p>are coming from emerging markets, even as their local, smaller competitors are 
</p>
<p>growing exponentially.6 The reasons MNCs have fallen short have been covered in 
</p>
<p>multiple research studies, and often come down to three: a failure to understand at a 
</p>
<p>deep level inhabitants&rsquo; needs and wants, MNCs&rsquo; inability to adapt and work with 
</p>
<p>limited infrastructure and resources, and the lack of trust residents place in MNCs, 
</p>
<p>which they feel historically have exploited them and their country&rsquo;s resources.
</p>
<p>Can integrating sustainability into their business help companies to harness the 
</p>
<p>potential of emerging markets? Unilever&rsquo;s holistic, long-term approach suggests it 
</p>
<p>can.
</p>
<p> Unilever
</p>
<p>Since the 1880s, Unilever has built its business on applying innovation to meet the 
</p>
<p>needs of the masses, such as making soap widely available or producing margarine 
</p>
<p>that could provide an affordable and transportable alternative to butter. A decentral-
</p>
<p>ized global company headquartered in the U.K., Unilever has operated in develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries for more than 100&nbsp;years. Its purpose&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;to make sustainable living 
</p>
<p>commonplace&rdquo;7 and &ldquo;create a better future every day, with brands and services that 
</p>
<p>help people feel good, look good and get more out of life&rdquo;8&nbsp;&ndash; is deeply rooted in its

<p> Seeking a&nbsp;New Strategy for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Twenty-First Century
</p>
<p>When Paul Polman was appointed CEO of Unilever in 2009, he immediately set out 
</p>
<p>to transform Unilever into an enterprise that would continue to grow and prosper, 
</p>
<p>but one that would also tackle the complex global issues of the twenty-first century. 
</p>
<p>His first act was to conduct a strategic review of the company that looked out to 
</p>
<p>2020. This review revealed four megatrends:
</p>
<p>&bull; Shifts in Markets: Population growth is shifting to the south and east&nbsp;&ndash; to Asia, 
</p>
<p>Africa and Latin America&nbsp;&ndash; areas that offer huge market potential but also have 
</p>
<p>constraints, such as residents&rsquo; lack of steady income and access to water.
</p>
<p>&bull; Shifts in Lifestyles: Around the world, more and more people are moving from 
</p>
<p>rural to urban centers, leaving farms behind, aspiring to middle-class lifestyles, 
</p>
<p>and testing already fragile infrastructures. They are also living longer. All these 
</p>
<p>changes require rethinking product design and development, as well as distribu-
</p>
<p>tion and supply chain logistics.
</p>
<p>&bull; Shifts in Environment: Conditions under which people are living are increas-
</p>
<p>ingly under stress. Water scarcity, poor sanitation, deforestation, and climate 
</p>
<p>change all raise product development and manufacturing questions as well as 
</p>
<p>supply chain security issues.
</p>
<p>&bull; Shifts in Stakeholder Empowerment: Increasing access to communication 
</p>
<p>technology has empowered citizens, requiring greater corporate transparency 
</p>
<p>and stakeholder engagement to minimize the risk to reputation and limit the 
</p>
<p>demand for more stringent regulations.
</p>
<p>It became obvious that the old strategic models would not work: for Unilever to 
</p>
<p>continue to grow its revenues, especially in the promising emerging markets, the 
</p>
<p>company needed to &ldquo;develop a business model aimed at contributing to society and 
</p>
<p>the environment instead of taking from them.&rdquo;9

<p> The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan
</p>
<p>Sustainability champions at Unilever, notably operation heads in India and South 
</p>
<p>Africa and the chief procurement officer, had long seen that helping to build sustain-
</p>
<p>able livelihoods and communities in emerging countries was a critical first step to 
</p>
<p>building markets and achieving growth. In 2005, they helped to launch the &ldquo;Brand 
</p>
<p>Imprint&rdquo; initiative, the company&rsquo;s first multidisciplinary attempt to engage the two 
</p>
<p>billion consumers a day who use Unilever&rsquo;s 400+ brands in the fight against envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental waste and in support of social causes. Product managers were instructed 
</p>
<p>to work across disciplines and use both life-cycle and value-chain analyses to iden-
</p>
<p>tify and assess the social and environmental impact of the company&rsquo;s top 13

<p>(&euro;1 billion+) brands.
</p>
<p>Polman&rsquo;s ambitions were even bolder. He challenged his management team: how 
</p>
<p>could the company reshape its business and redefine its strategy to reach more peo-
</p>
<p>ple, secure its supply chain, deliver better products but use fewer resources, all in 
</p>
<p>ways that could withstand the scrutiny of an ever-connected, more socially and 
</p>
<p>environmentally aware public?
</p>
<p>Unilever&rsquo;s vision to &ldquo;double the size of the business, whilst reducing our environ-
</p>
<p>mental footprint&rdquo; was first discussed with the Board in autumn 2009 and subse-
</p>
<p>quently refined to include &ldquo;&hellip;reducing our environmental footprint and increasing 
</p>
<p>our positive social impact.&rdquo;10. This vision is at the heart of the Compass, Unilever&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>business strategy for sustainable growth, which sets out the company&rsquo;s vision, its 
</p>
<p>purpose and how it will succeed for the long term (see Appendix 1).
</p>
<p>The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP)&nbsp;&ndash; the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;ten year journey 
</p>
<p>towards sustainable growth&rdquo;11&nbsp;&ndash; was launched in November 2010. It is an ambitious 
</p>
<p>plan that seeks three significant sustainable outcomes by 2020:
</p>
<p>&bull; First, to help more than a billion people to improve their health and well-being,
</p>
<p>&bull; Second, to halve the environmental footprint of their products,
</p>
<p>&bull; Last, to source 100% of its agricultural raw materials sustainably and enhance 
</p>
<p>the livelihoods of millions of people across the value chain.12
</p>
<p>The underlying principle is to grow revenues both aggressively and responsibly. 
</p>
<p>Each business was asked to examine all its brands, products and operations not just 
</p>
<p>from a market perspective, but from the perspective of how each created positive 
</p>
<p>social impact and reduced environmental effects.
</p>
<p>Given the company&rsquo;s long history of balancing profit with responsible business 
</p>
<p>practices, the Board was supportive of the strategic direction proposed. However, 
</p>
<p>some members of the Board and Unilever Leadership Executive struggled with 
</p>
<p>what they felt was a radical ideology: integrating social and environmental criteria

</p>
<p>into the business was, they believed, inconsistent with the concept of capitalism and 
</p>
<p>maximizing shareholder value, and therefore not viable in the long term. The man-
</p>
<p>agement was unclear as to why the company couldn&rsquo;t use proven strategies, with 
</p>
<p>minor adjustments, to address these emerging trends. Since sustainability had not 
</p>
<p>previously been considered in an integrated way, the leadership team needed a fair 
</p>
<p>amount of re-education.
</p>
<p>Polman&rsquo;s compelling argument held: that, given the megatrends and increasing 
</p>
<p>numbers of locally-grown competitors, particularly in emerging markets, sustain-
</p>
<p>ability was about both strategic growth and risk management. He was moving his 
</p>
<p>management team in the direction of creating a new, more holistic model for growth. 
</p>
<p>It would require changing mindsets, committing time and a willingness to take 
</p>
<p>chances. They were charting a whole new path: it was all about Unilever &ldquo;Getting 
</p>
<p>to the Future First.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Embedding the&nbsp;Unilever Sustainable Living Plan
</p>
<p>Unilever&rsquo;s approach to sustainability is systematic and holistic: it spans its entire 
</p>
<p>portfolio of products and countries, it encompasses its value chain from beginning 
</p>
<p>to end, and considers the lives of all those it touches, from farmers to retailers to 
</p>
<p>employees to consumers. It is embedded into the business in four distinct ways: (1) 
</p>
<p>within brands and categories; (2) within R&amp;D; (3) within its reward and measure-
</p>
<p>ment systems; and (4) through an integrated governance system (see Appendix 2).
</p>
<p>Managers within functions and its four categories (Foods, Refreshment, Personal 
</p>
<p>Care, and Home Care) work up, down and across the organization, looking at their 
</p>
<p>own operations as well as those of their suppliers and distributors, all the way to the 
</p>
<p>end consumer, through a &ldquo;sustainability lens.&rdquo; The company is accelerating the inte-
</p>
<p>gration of sustainability into its brands, enabling brand managers to develop their 
</p>
<p>own Unilever Sustainable Living Plan ambitions. These ambitions are then built 
</p>
<p>into Unilever&rsquo;s R&amp;D, training and communication programs to drive innovation. 
</p>
<p>Using proprietary tools, managers assess the potential social and environmental 
</p>
<p>impact of new products at every stage of development.
</p>
<p>In its food category, for example, Knorr has chosen sustainable sourcing as its 
</p>
<p>ambition. The brand created the &ldquo;Knorr Landmark Farms&rdquo; to develop and promote 
</p>
<p>sustainable farming practices and today has 45 of these farms globally. By 2014, 
</p>
<p>90% of its 13 most-used vegetables were being sustainably sourced.
</p>
<p>When it comes to scarce water resources, not only do managers challenge them-
</p>
<p>selves as to how much water Unilever uses in its own manufacturing processes, they 
</p>
<p>also ask how they can develop products that enable the consumer who purchases 
</p>
<p>Unilever&rsquo;s laundry soap to conserve water, particularly in water stressed areas. The 
</p>
<p>company considers its own waste and recycling, but then pushes its managers to 
</p>
<p>think: how can they help the consumer reduce the waste that Unilever&rsquo;s own prod-
</p>
<p>ucts are generating?
</p>
<p>Unilever has extended its sustainability challenge externally: through its 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partners to Win 2020&rdquo; programme, the company calls those who work with them, 
</p>
<p>21 Sustainability as&nbsp;Opportunity: Unilever&rsquo;s Sustainable Living Plan</p>

</p>
<p>such as suppliers, to create and share breakthroughs in products and packaging. It 
</p>
<p>stands behind and exemplifies its commitment: in 2014, Unilever announced it 
</p>
<p>would be waiving its exclusive rights to a revolutionary packaging technology 
</p>
<p>whose light weight promises to reduce environmental impact in order to encourage 
</p>
<p>all FMCG companies to adapt it.
</p>
<p>A portion of Unilever&rsquo;s budget is committed to finding radical new technologies 
</p>
<p>to help achieve aggressive sustainability targets. The Unilever Foundry is an Open 
</p>
<p>Innovation Platform whereby the company seeks to &ldquo;collaborate with innovators to 
</p>
<p>make sustainable living commonplace.&rdquo;13. It offers its own executives as mentors 
</p>
<p>and provides funding to help commercialize some of the more promising new tech-
</p>
<p>nologies that support sustainable living (e.g., cold water laundry products). Its 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Share-Select-Scale&rdquo; model invites broad participation from all sectors, including 
</p>
<p>individuals, entrepreneurs, innovators, start-ups and NGOs.
</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s innovation mindset goes beyond products and packaging to cre-
</p>
<p>ating unique partnerships that improve lives. Roughly 50% of Unilever&rsquo;s raw mate-
</p>
<p>rials come from farms or forests. Smallholder farmers (many with two or less 
</p>
<p>hectares) produce 70% of the world&rsquo;s food and make up more than 85% of the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s farms.14 Unilever&rsquo;s unique collaboration with the Clinton Foundation and 
</p>
<p>Acumen Fund&nbsp; &ndash; the Enhanced Livelihoods Investment Initiative (ELII)&nbsp; &ndash; helps 
</p>
<p>these smallholder farmers to scale up their enterprises so they can then be linked 
</p>
<p>into Unilever&rsquo;s global supply chain and distribution network.
</p>
<p>To ensure that they stay on track towards their goals, measuring progress is key. 
</p>
<p>The company initially established seven commitments supported by around 50 tar-
</p>
<p>gets and KPIs to assess its progress. After conducting a comprehensive review of 
</p>
<p>their progress against these goals in 2013, the company found that fundamental to 
</p>
<p>removing barriers and achieving their targets would be their ability to improve live-
</p>
<p>lihoods: &ldquo;healthy societies support healthy businesses&rdquo;.15 They expanded the seven 
</p>
<p>commitments to nine in 2013 to bring greater focus to driving human rights, advanc-
</p>
<p>ing opportunities for women and developing more inclusive businesses (see 
</p>
<p>Appendix 3).
</p>
<p>All of these commitments are integrated into the company&rsquo;s internal and external 
</p>
<p>communications, training and human resource systems, making the Unilever 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Living Plan core to the company&rsquo;s culture. Remuneration arrangements 
</p>
<p>support the sustainability agenda, with accountability starting at the top: objectives 
</p>
<p>relating to the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan are integrated into both the CEO 
</p>
<p>and Chief Marketing Officer&rsquo;s annual performance review, and are periodically

</p>
<p>reviewed by the Board. Further down the organization, objectives are integrated 
</p>
<p>specifically into the targets of employees driving Unilever Sustainable Living Plan 
</p>
<p>outcomes. For example, in the procurement function, the team leading the sustain-
</p>
<p>able sourcing of agricultural raw materials has clear targets to ensure such deliver-
</p>
<p>ables as security of supply, reduced costs and the protection of scarce resources.
</p>
<p>Finally, the company actively and systematically involves external stakeholders 
</p>
<p>to ensure they are aligned with its strategy. It hosted the Sustainable Living Lab, a 
</p>
<p>process that engaged more than 2,000 stakeholders from 70 countries in a 24-h live 
</p>
<p>dialogue to evaluate the Plan&rsquo;s successes, failures, and ways to move forward. 
</p>
<p>Managers make a point of collaborating closely with NGOs and governments in 
</p>
<p>emerging markets, embedding themselves and doing the &ldquo;deep dives&rdquo; recommended 
</p>
<p>to really understand local markets and secure resources, building trust and reputa-
</p>
<p>tion along the way. They tap into their employee and consumer base, encouraging 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small Actions, Big Difference&rdquo; to help redefine how business gets done.
</p>
<p>For example, in 2014, employees across Unilever&rsquo;s factory network&nbsp;&ndash; more than 
</p>
<p>240 factories in 67 countries&nbsp;&ndash; reduced the amount of non-hazardous waste deliv-
</p>
<p>ered to landfills to zero&nbsp;&ndash; thought to be a first for a company of Unilever&rsquo;s size.16 
</p>
<p>These creative &ldquo;zeromakers&rdquo; have found ways to recycle tea bags into wallpaper, 
</p>
<p>mayonnaise into biofuels and plastic laminate into school desks.
</p>
<p> Employees Help Lead the&nbsp;Way
</p>
<p>Rather than simply talking about the need to integrate sustainability into its 
</p>
<p>brands, Unilever actively engages its employees to give them hands-on experience 
</p>
<p>with what that integration looks like, and even more important, feels like. The result: 
</p>
<p>the more employees understand, the deeper their insights and greater their opportu-
</p>
<p>nity to contribute and innovate.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be particularly relevant given the company&rsquo;s experience with the 
</p>
<p>generation now joining its ranks,&rdquo; according to Karen Hamilton, Vice President of 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Business. &ldquo;Shaped by major events of the last decade, such as 9/11, 
</p>
<p>Occupy Wall Street and the economic downturn, these younger employees are more 
</p>
<p>open to thinking about business in a new way, and want to be involved. Unilever is 
</p>
<p>tapping into their positive attitudes, energy and ideas through engaging them 
</p>
<p>directly.&rdquo;17

<p>The old Chinese proverb, &ldquo;Tell me and I&rsquo;ll forget; show me and I may remem-

</p>
<p>This engagement takes the form of volunteerism, idea generation, and sharing 
</p>
<p>best practices.
</p>
<p>For example, in India, employees volunteer to work on the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Help a 
</p>
<p>Child Reach Five campaign&rdquo;, going into rural villages to teach children how to wash 
</p>
<p>their hands and their parents on why washing matters. (See shaded box, Unilever 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Living Plan in Action: Lifebuoy Soap).
</p>
<p>Self-confidence and self-esteem&nbsp;&ndash; critical to realizing one&rsquo;s potential&nbsp;&ndash; has long 
</p>
<p>been linked to body image, particularly for girls. The Dove Self-Esteem Project, 
</p>
<p>founded in 2004, strives to help young people build body confidence through shar-
</p>
<p>ing their message that beauty comes from the inside out. Employees participate in 
</p>
<p>delivering self-esteem education to young people (primarily girls) aged 8&ndash;17&nbsp;years 
</p>
<p>through lessons in schools. In 2014, employees reached more than 20,000 young 
</p>
<p>people in 152 schools across 36 countries&nbsp;&ndash; up 67% from the year before. More than 
</p>
<p>2700 staff attended Dove Day events, nearly double the number who took part in 
</p>
<p>2013. Ninety percent of employees say they feel proud to work for Unilever. Dove&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>goal: to reach 15 million young people by the end of 2015, enabling them to reach 
</p>
<p>their full potential.
</p>
<p> Small Actions Make a&nbsp;Big Difference
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many employees have sustainable business ideas,&rdquo; explains John Maguire, 
</p>
<p>Unilever&rsquo;s Group Manufacturing Sustainability Director. &ldquo;Factory teams can apply 
</p>
<p>for investment for their ideas via our &ldquo;Small Actions, Big Difference&rdquo; fund. Ideas 
</p>
<p>are evaluated on the basis of environmental benefit and financial return. This ensures 
</p>
<p>that only the best projects are selected.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2014, we invested &euro;13 million in 173 energy and emissions reduction proj-
</p>
<p>ects. These will reduce global CO2 emissions by 4% and global energy use by 2%, 
</p>
<p>achieving an average payback of less than two years.&rdquo;18
</p>
<p>Examples of projects where Small Actions collectively have delivered a Big 
</p>
<p>Difference are improvements to compressed air systems, installing energy-efficient 
</p>
<p>lighting, process optimisation and increased production efficiencies, high efficiency 
</p>
<p>electrical motors, and reuse of by-products of manufacturing processes.
</p>
<p> Sharing &ldquo;Proud Practice&rdquo; Projects Globally
</p>
<p>Finally, the company leverages its employees&rsquo; best ideas. Unilever&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smarter 
</p>
<p>Greener Living&rdquo; campaign, started in 2013, was aimed at involving as many factory 
</p>
<p>workers as possible in improving the company&rsquo;s eco-efficiency footprint.

</p>
<p>The company harnesses the enthusiasm it created by sharing these Proud Practice 
</p>
<p>projects&nbsp;&ndash; of which there are now more than 170 &ndash;and replicating them elsewhere, 
</p>
<p>ensuring faster and more efficient delivery of environmental benefits. Employees&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>seeing that their best ideas are supported by the company and many are rolled out 
</p>
<p>globally&nbsp;&ndash; are strongly motivated to keep generating new ideas.
</p>
<p>In each case, Unilever&rsquo;s focus on giving employees a direct, hands-on experience 
</p>
<p>with its sustainability principles results in even greater participation and enthusiasm 
</p>
<p>for the Unilever Sustainability Living Plan, making employees an integral part of its 
</p>
<p>virtuous circle of growth (see Appendix 1).
</p>
<p>In the case of the two billion consumers Unilever reaches every day, classic mar-
</p>
<p>keting tools are often proving insufficient. Instead, it is often a matter of building 
</p>
<p>awareness about the particular issue, placing it in context, and showing how slight 
</p>
<p>changes in their day-to-day behavior can have a cumulative impact. In Dubai, where 
</p>
<p>awareness of the need to conserve water is very low, Unilever ran a &ldquo;Water Savers&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>campaign, partnering with the Dubai Water and Electricity Authority to reinforce its 
</p>
<p>message. It then showed consumers how its products, such as Sunlight dishwashing 
</p>
<p>soap, required 20% less water to get dishes clean.19 Product sales went up, while 
</p>
<p>water consumption went down. Water Savers has delivered sales of more than 20% 
</p>
<p>above market growth for Unilever&rsquo;s brands. More importantly, attitudes have 
</p>
<p>shifted: more than half the shoppers who engaged in the campaign have taken 
</p>
<p>actions to save water.
</p>
<p>Unilever&rsquo;s commitment is from top to bottom, inside-out and outside-in, as evi-
</p>
<p>denced by its governance structure: there are two Board level committees whose 
</p>
<p>sole responsibility is the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan&nbsp;&ndash; including one that con-
</p>
<p>sists of external experts who are expected to comment and critique on Unilever&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>approach, as well as advise on emerging trends and potential risks regarding sus-
</p>
<p>tainability issues (see Appendix 2).
</p>
<p>In a further move to signal the company&rsquo;s long-term commitment to the Unilever 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Living Plan, the company no longer issues quarterly guidance, under-
</p>
<p>scoring management&rsquo;s belief that realizing returns from investing in sustainability 
</p>
<p>takes time. When the new policy was announced, initial investor reaction was swift: 
</p>
<p>share prices dropped 8% as shareholders feared the worst. But for Polman, it was a 
</p>
<p>signal to the financial markets that Unilever was committed to the future: that deci-
</p>
<p>sions would be made to ensure the long term viability of the company, and not 
</p>
<p>focused on quarterly numbers. As he later explained, &ldquo;We spent a lot of time think-
</p>
<p>ing about what is happening in this world and the role of companies, and to basi-
</p>
<p>cally communicate out there that we have obligations towards multiple stakeholders 
</p>
<p>&hellip;I don&rsquo;t have any space for many of these people that really, in the short-term, try 
</p>
<p>to speculate and make a lot of money. I&rsquo;m not just working for them&hellip;&rdquo;20

</p>
<p>For Unilever the business case for integrating sustainability into the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>brands is clear and persuasive:
</p>
<p>Sustainability is contributing to our virtuous circle of growth. The more our products meet 
</p>
<p>social needs and help people live sustainably, the more popular our brands become and the 
</p>
<p>more we grow. And the more efficient we are at managing resources such as energy and raw 
</p>
<p>materials, the more we lower our costs and reduce the risks to our business and the more 
</p>
<p>we are able to invest in sustainable innovation and brands.&nbsp;&ndash; Paul Polman, CEO21
</p>
<p>Unilever&rsquo;s actions are consistent with the ESG (Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Governance) Value Driver framework, whereby sustainability actions are linked to 
</p>
<p>new growth opportunities, risk management and return on capital as a basis for 
</p>
<p>communicating with investors (see Appendix 4). Their &ldquo;sustainable living brands&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>are contributing to Unilever&rsquo;s purpose to make sustainable living commonplace, and 
</p>
<p>in ways that are defined and measurable, whether that involves improving health, 
</p>
<p>wellbeing or nutrition, reducing environmental impacts or using sustainably sourced 
</p>
<p>ingredients. They are also contributing to the company&rsquo;s performance: in 2014, 
</p>
<p>around 50% of Unilever&rsquo;s growth came from these sustainable living brands: they 
</p>
<p>grew at twice the rate of the rest of the business.
</p>
<p>Echoing Unilever&rsquo;s founding vision&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;to make cleanliness commonplace&rdquo;22&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>the vision of Unilever&rsquo;s iconic Lifebuoy antibacterial soap is to create &ldquo;more 
</p>
<p>hygienic, healthier and ultimately more vital communities.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In addition to revenue targets, the goals for Lifebuoy include the triple bottom 
</p>
<p>line:
</p>
<p>&bull; Social: Reduce respiratory infections and diarrhea, the two biggest causes of 
</p>
<p>child mortality.
</p>
<p>&bull; Environmental: Reduce the amount of water needed to use the soap.
</p>
<p>&bull; Economic: Enhance the livelihoods of those in the value chain.
</p>
<p>In locations where soap usage is infrequent and diarrhea disease strikes most 
</p>
<p>frequently, Lifebuoy launched its Handwashing Behavior Change programme to 
</p>
<p>promote the benefits of washing with soap. In India, where more than 1000 children 
</p>
<p>die each day, Lifebuoy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Help a Child Reach Five&rdquo; campaign focuses on how sim-
</p>
<p>ply washing hands with soap at key occasions can help a child reach the critical age 
</p>
<p>of 5&nbsp; years old. Since 2010, the handwashing campaign has reached 119 million 
</p>
<p>people, resulting in lower incidences of diarrhea. A 2008 clinical study in Mumbai

<p>Unilever Sustainable Living Plan in Action: LIFEBUOY SOAP

</p>
<p>showed that children had a 25% lower incidence of diarrhea compared to the control 
</p>
<p>group, 15% fewer acute respiratory infections, 46% fewer eye infections and a 27% 
</p>
<p>reduction in school absences. The programme also drove a 31% reduction in inci-
</p>
<p>dence of diarrhea for all subjects, showing that the campaign delivers benefits for 
</p>
<p>the whole family.23
</p>
<p>To further promote handwashing among children, Unilever developed the inno-
</p>
<p>vative Lifebuoy colour change handwash. Promoted by the cartoon character the 
</p>
<p>Incredible Hulk, the lather changes from white to green when hands have been 
</p>
<p>washed long enough for Lifebuoy&rsquo;s special formulation to deliver 99.9% germ pro-
</p>
<p>tection. Market test results show that children (and their parents!) can&rsquo;t get enough 
</p>
<p>of the new product.
</p>
<p>To address the environmental issue of stressed water supplies, Unilever&rsquo;s R&amp;D 
</p>
<p>team developed Lifebuoy Instant Foam Handwash, an anti-bacterial soap that uses 
</p>
<p>more than one-third less water than a typical bar of soap, helping the consumer to 
</p>
<p>reduce water consumption. Delivered as a foam, it allows users to skip the step of 
</p>
<p>wetting hands before lathering, saving water while delivering a highly effective 
</p>
<p>handwash because the foam spreads quickly.
</p>
<p>Its most recent breakthrough is Lifebuoy with Activ Naturol Shield, a re- 
</p>
<p>formulation that provides ten times superior protection against all types of germs 
</p>
<p>including those that cause cholera, typhoid, and stomach infections as well as com-
</p>
<p>bats skin and eye infections.
</p>
<p>Finally, in further efforts to build sustainable livelihoods and communities, 
</p>
<p>Lifebuoy is sold through Unilever&rsquo;s unique distribution network, Shakti. Shakti has 
</p>
<p>recruited, trained and employed 70,000 rural women in India to become entrepre-
</p>
<p>neurs, enabling them to reach millions of households in more than 100,000 of 
</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s most remote villages. As the women become empowered and increase their 
</p>
<p>income, they also help raise education levels and improve the health standards in 
</p>
<p>their communities.
</p>
<p>The brand&rsquo;s ambitious goal: to reach one billion consumers globally with its 
</p>
<p>hygiene education programmes by 2020.
</p>
<p>Through successfully addressing the social and environmental needs of the 
</p>
<p>developing world, Lifebuoy has delivered against its financial goals as well. 
</p>
<p>Globally, Lifebuoy experienced double-digit sales growth from 2010 to 2014 and is 
</p>
<p>well on track to becoming one of Unilever&rsquo;s next billion-euro brands. It has led to 
</p>
<p>product innovations that are applicable across regions, such as the foam technology, 
</p>
<p>and resulted in unique and effective outreach partnerships, co-investments, and col-
</p>
<p>laborations with local governments and NGOs. Its handwashing campaign has 
</p>
<p>raised awareness, built trust and improved Unilever&rsquo;s reputation in the region. Taken 
</p>
<p>together, the Lifebuoy campaign exemplifies many of the success factors cited by 
</p>

<p>to realizing the potential of emerging markets. Today, it is the world&rsquo;s number one 
</p>
<p>anti-bacterial soap brand.
</p>
<p>The Lifebuoy soap experience embodies the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan 
</p>
<p>and the company&rsquo;s commitment to grow revenues responsibly&nbsp;&ndash; in a way that helps 
</p>
<p>improve people&rsquo;s health and well-being, reduces environmental impact, enhances 
</p>
<p>lives and creates consistent growth.
</p>
<p> Unilever&rsquo;s Sustainable Living Plan: Too Risky, Too Ambitious?
</p>
<p>Is Unilever&rsquo;s growth through sustainability on track?
</p>
<p>In 2014, more than 57% of Unilever&rsquo;s revenues were generated from developing 
</p>
<p>markets in Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. Its underly-
</p>
<p>ing growth in emerging markets rose 5.9% over 2013, and has averaged 9% for the 
</p>
<p>past 5&nbsp;years.24 With the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan as its platform, the com-
</p>
<p>pany anticipates that emerging markets will contribute around 70% of sales25 and 
</p>
<p>the company is on its way towards achieving its goal of doubling the size of its 
</p>
<p>business.
</p>
<p>Despite a challenging economic environment and unstable political conditions in 
</p>
<p>some of its markets, the company managed to increase underlying sales, with sev-
</p>
<p>eral of its major sustainability-driven brands like Lifebuoy and Dove increasing by 
</p>
<p>high single or double digits, and improved its core operating margin. Its dividends 
</p>
<p>grew 7% in 2014, resulting in a total return to shareholders (dividends plus share 
</p>
<p>price) of 18%, up 79% in the last 5&nbsp;years26 (see Appendices 4 and 5).
</p>
<p>The USLP is embedded into our business model. It helps to drive long-term shareholder 
</p>
<p>value by: driving growth through innovations that bring new sustainability benefits to con-
</p>
<p>sumers and retailers; reducing waste and energy and thereby saving cost; and managing 
</p>
<p>risk in our supply chain, for example by securing long-term sustainable sourcing of 
</p>
<p>materials.27
</p>
<p>The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan has the ability to provide the company 
</p>
<p>with a strategic advantage and to set it apart from its competitors. It has the potential 
</p>
<p>to not just transform Unilever, but to help&nbsp;change processes in the very societies in 
</p>
<p>which the company operates, creating inclusive economies and true shared value.
</p>
<p>Consistent with this view, Polman has grown even more ambitious since launch-
</p>
<p>ing the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, viewing sustainability-driven business as

</p>
<p>key to transformational change: change whereby societies and, ultimately, business 
</p>
<p>prosper as a result of reduced environmental risks and greater human development. 
</p>
<p>He advocates that business take more of a &ldquo;systems&rdquo; approach to their operations, 
</p>
<p>seeing companies as part of an interconnected web linking multiple players&nbsp; &ndash; 
</p>
<p>including governments&nbsp; &ndash; that have the potential to improve living standards for 
</p>
<p>billions of people, creating a new middle class and a more inclusive economy. In 
</p>
<p>2014, he made the mandate for Unilever even bigger, seeking to use the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>scale to leverage its resources and expertise in three core areas: eliminating defores-
</p>
<p>tation, helping smallholder farmers, and making access to water, hygiene and sani-
</p>
<p>tation universal.
</p>
<p>For example, as one of the world&rsquo;s largest users of forests and farms, Unilever is 
</p>
<p>partnering with governments, including Norway, the Netherlands, the U.K., U.S. 
</p>
<p>and multiple NGOs as part of the Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) to help eliminate 
</p>
<p>deforestation from the supply chains of all consumer goods companies.
</p>
<p>As one of the world&rsquo;s foremost experts in changing consumer behavior, Unilever 
</p>
<p>is building on its core competency&nbsp;&ndash; marketing&nbsp;&ndash; to promote changes in hygiene and 
</p>
<p>sanitation among the world&rsquo;s poorest populations. It employs what it calls its &ldquo;Five 
</p>
<p>Levers for Change&rdquo; which seeks to make the change to sustainability-driven behav-
</p>
<p>ior understood, easy, desirable, rewarding and in the end, a habit.28 In one instance, 
</p>
<p>its holistic approach involves its household cleaning product brand, Domestos. The 
</p>
<p>Domestos Toilet Academy is improving sanitation practices at the individual level 
</p>
<p>while at the same time it is training entrepreneurs to form businesses that will sup-
</p>
<p>ply, install and maintain hygienic toilets, helping the communities to prosper. 
</p>
<p>Domestos has set the target of helping 25 million people gain improved access to a 
</p>
<p>toilet by 2020.
</p>
<p>Aside from the moral mandate, Polman sees this new way of operating and lever-
</p>
<p>aging the company&rsquo;s scale as critical to Unilever&rsquo;s future: by eliminating deforesta-
</p>
<p>tion, helping smallholder farmers, and improving access to water, hygiene and 
</p>
<p>sanitation, the company is also mitigating its own risk by ensuring adequate 
</p>
<p>resources and quality supply chains, and driving its growth through brands which 
</p>
<p>offer health and hygiene benefits. He advocates working with governments and 
</p>
<p>other partners to institute polices that will result in lasting change.
</p>
<p>We are at a turning point in history, a point where we all need to change for human life on 
</p>
<p>the planet to continue to prosper. A new business model with sustainability at its heart is 
</p>
<p>vital for quality of life around the globe to improve. Only the businesses that grasp this will 
</p>
<p>survive. Only those who grow sustainably will thrive&hellip;. Paul Polman, CEO29
</p>
<p>Underscoring its commitment to this new role for business, Unilever became the 
</p>
<p>first company to sign onto the UN&rsquo;s Guiding Principles on Human Rights, and to 
</p>
<p>issue a stand-alone report on the topic. Given its 76,000 suppliers, 172,000

<p>extremely vulnerable to criticism. But is it too bold, too ambitious? Is Unilever

<p>overstepping its bounds as a business, or simply seeking to grow its markets by

<p>Making sustainable living commonplace for our consumers is helping to drive

Note: In 2013, Unilever&rsquo;s management increased the original seven Commitments of the Unilever 
Sustainable Living Plan to nine. The orginal seventh Commitment&nbsp;&ndash; Enhancing livelioods&nbsp;&ndash; was 
expanded to encompass more human rights issues, such as ensuring fair compensation, healthy and 
safe working conditions, and employee development, to more specificaly target women by uphold-
ing diverity and offering them opportunties, and to focus on bringing more people into the econ-
omy by helping to train and support smallholder farmers in particular.

led to Lifebuoy Foam Handwash and 
Comfort One Rinse for laundry; to 
reduce waste and emissions, new 
packaging materials developed 
(bi-modal resins) that lighten weight 
and save shipping costs; waived 
exclusive rights to package-saving 
technology for Dove bottle that uses 
15% less plastic to encourage other 
companies to use the technology; 
re-engineered aerosol spray system so 
that new compressed deodorant cans 
use half the propellant gas and 25% 
less aluminum than traditional cans, 
reducing carbon footprint by 25%.

<p>Unilever Sustainable Living Plan 
encompasses ESG elements and is 
integrated into strategy, operations 
and governance; human rights 
recently integrated more explicitly; 
company has a zero tolerance policy 
on forced labour, and trains 
employees on human trafficking 
prevention. Progress against financial 
and non-financial targets are included

<p>Part V
</p>
<p>Introduction: Business Model Innovation and 
</p>
<p>Transformation
</p>
<p>Gilbert&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Lenssen 
</p>
<p>Sustainable development with significantly reduced environmental and social 
</p>
<p>impacts is a challenge for business of serious magnitude (e.g. carbon neutral opera-
</p>
<p>tions), often requiring significant transformations in business models and industry 
</p>
<p>structures. It is likely to have deep effects comparable to the effects of the consumer 
</p>
<p>revolution of the eighties and the IT revolution which started in the nineties. In addi-
</p>
<p>tion to innovations in products, services and processes, business can create competi-
</p>
<p>tive advantage or avoid erosion of current market positions by exploring new 
</p>
<p>business models developed to address sustainability issues. In fact, with sustain-
</p>
<p>ability in mind, innovation often results in new business models, as we see in Part 
</p>
<p>IV with Illy and GE Ecomagination.
</p>
<p>IBM realised that its PC business would over time not be able to compete with 
</p>
<p>Chinese market entrants and so it sold the business to a Chinese newcomer (Lenovo) 
</p>
<p>at a time when the market value was still relatively high. IBM moved up the value 
</p>
<p>chain into a Total Customer Solution value proposition which included its Smarter 
</p>
<p>Planet initiative&mdash;and a business operating model behind this which is significantly 
</p>
<p>different. The IBM case thus illustrates sustainability transformation with an inno-
</p>
<p>vative business model.
</p>
<p>BP Solarex was a market leader in the solar industry in 2000. It scaled back its 
</p>
<p>business model to a pure Operational Excellence proposition (manufacturing and 
</p>
<p>distributing solar panels), inspired by the fashion of focusing on &ldquo;core compe-
</p>
<p>tences&rdquo;&mdash;arguably, a fashion already on its way out. Experiments with Total 
</p>
<p>Customer Solutions, the approach adopted by IBM, were halted and abolished. Ten 
</p>
<p>years later, BP was forced to close most manufacturing facilities at high cost in the 
</p>
<p>face of stiff cost competition from China. In 2000, BP could have sold these facili-
</p>
<p>ties at market value and moved up the value chain. In 2010, it was too late.
</p>
<p>As the significant changes in these two examples illustrate, business model inno-
</p>
<p>vation is clearly NOT about minor changes to the business model to capture easy 
</p>
<p>gains in costs and efficiency, nor about a compliance driven adaptation to gradually 
</p>
<p>minimise negative impacts.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>458
</p>
<p>Key Questions to Ask (Applicable to All Part V Cases)
</p>
<p>How are synergies identified between sustainability and innovation success?
</p>
<p>How can products, processes and systemic innovative solutions leverage sustain-
</p>
<p>ability issues and turn them into opportunities for companies?
</p>
<p>How is sustainability-driven innovation leading to a new business model?
</p>
<p>How is the transformation process rolling out?
</p>
<p>What are the industry sector relevant competitive market positions aimed for? What 
</p>
<p>needs are being addressed in the marketplace?
</p>
<p>How is value created for each stakeholder?
</p>
<p>What are the existing relevant resources to support these new positions?
</p>
<p>Which new resources are required (knowledge, capabilities, relationships) and how 
</p>
<p>are these resources acquired and integrated?
</p>
<p>Chapter 22: Model Behaviour: 20 Business Models for Sustainability by 
</p>
<p>Lindsay Clinton and Ryan Whisnant
</p>
<p>The idea of business model innovation has long captivated business leaders. And 
</p>
<p>yet, executives are often held back by vested interests in their current approach. But 
</p>
<p>as global trends&mdash;environmental, social, political, technological&mdash;continue to shift 
</p>
<p>the foundations of current business models, incremental innovation will become 
</p>
<p>less effective in enabling companies, industries and whole economies to adapt and 
</p>
<p>succeed. There is a pressing need for fundamentally different approaches to value 
</p>
<p>creation.
</p>
<p>The utility industry, for example, is currently confronting a mounting crisis 
</p>
<p>within its existing business model. Changing regulations, rising fossil fuel prices, 
</p>
<p>falling prices of renewables, and the arrival of improved energy storage solutions 
</p>
<p>and other decentralized energy options will completely alter the playing field for 
</p>
<p>large coal and nuclear-powered utilities. These large-scale, centralized systems have 
</p>
<p>been disrupted by the rise of smaller, decentralized energy systems, especially those 
</p>
<p>focused on delivering solar and other forms of alternative energy. While they once 
</p>
<p>captured just a tiny, elite niche of the energy marketplace, companies in this space 
</p>
<p>are now growing rapidly and helping speed the decline of the traditional, vertically 
</p>
<p>integrated utility model. While many utilities are struggling to handle this disrup-
</p>
<p>tion, some are acting quickly to adapt. RWE, a German utility with over 24 million 
</p>
<p>customers across Europe, plans to shift its traditional utility model and instead use 
</p>
<p>its expertise to help manage and integrate renewables into the grid, switching from 
</p>
<p>being a power seller to a renewable energy enabler, what we would call a product as 
</p>
<p>a service model. RWE is transforming from a &ldquo;volume to value&rdquo; business.
</p>
<p>The proliferation of such innovation gets to the core of why the authors from 
</p>
<p>Sustainability have written this contribution, trying to better understand which new 
</p>
<p>business models are emerging, where innovation is happening, and how both new 
</p>
<p>and established companies are experimenting to embed sustainability into the 
</p>
<p>underlying structure of their businesses.
</p>
<p>V  Introduction: Business Model Innovation and Transformation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>459
</p>
<p>This is based on research and review of 87 company examples, and 20 distinct 
</p>
<p>business models are indentified falling into five categories: environmental impact, 
</p>
<p>social innovation, base of the pyramid, financial innovation, and diverse impact.
</p>
<p>Chapter 23: From Incrementalism to Transformation: Reflections on 
</p>
<p>Corporate Sustainability by Peter Lacy, Rob Hayward &amp; Pranshu Gupta
</p>
<p>This chapter provides an overview of how the sustainable business agenda has 
</p>
<p>evolved over the last 10&ndash;15&nbsp;years and asks whether it is now somehow stuck. This 
</p>
<p>sentiment was echoed in the latest of Accenture&rsquo;s surveys of global CEO&rsquo;s carried 
</p>
<p>out for the UN Global Compact in 2013. Business leaders think that, when it comes 
</p>
<p>to sustainability, most of the &ldquo;low hanging fruit&rdquo; has been harvested in terms of 
</p>
<p>efficiency and shared value and thus business model transformations are required to 
</p>
<p>address major challenges like climate change, which are inhibited by only slowly 
</p>
<p>emerging systems transformations necessary to facilitate sustainability transitions. 
</p>
<p>System changes, going beyond system optimisation and partial system redesign&mdash;
</p>
<p>essential in areas like energy, transport, agro-food, and housing&mdash;require more than 
</p>
<p>product and process innovation and are complicated by the involvement of a wide 
</p>
<p>range of actors. According to global CEOs, the sustainability transitions are starting 
</p>
<p>(too) slowly and at different speeds and trajectories for different sectors and differ-
</p>
<p>ent countries.1 In the end, the feeling of CEOs is that this may end up being too little 
</p>
<p>too late if vested interests prevail, sunk investments are defended to the end, and 
</p>
<p>policy makers keep a short term (election-driven) horizon. CEOs concede that mar-
</p>
<p>ket forces may not suffice in driving change and that governments need to step in to 
</p>
<p>correct both market failures and policy failures. The chapter argues that business 
</p>
<p>leaders can do more, albeit it in a more interconnected, less firm-centric way.
</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Umicore: A Case of Radical Reinvention by Nigel Roome and 
</p>
<p>Victoria Jadot
</p>
<p>Umicore, a Belgian multinational widely recognised as a leader in sustainable busi-

<p>ness in precious metals and materials as well as technology solutions for sustainable

<p>development, rose as a phoenix out of the ashes of its predecessor company Union

<p>Mini&egrave;re, which probably held the worst environmental and social record in the 
</p>
<p>industry since its involvement in metal mining in the colonial era in Africa dating 
</p>
<p>back to the beginning van the twentieth century. Its competitive position under-
</p>
<p>mined by transformations in global markets and unable to adapt to change, its finan-
</p>
<p>cial performance record was equally dismal. The case describes the 5 stages the 
</p>
<p>company went through since the beginning of the nineties to achieve a world class 
</p>
<p>position in its industry with sustainability embedded and institutionalised through-
</p>
<p>out the organisation. The case is particularly interesting because it highlights the 
</p>
<p>role of change agents at the top and throughout middle management levels. They 
</p>
<p>were involved in bringing about the transformation in a sequence of steps: creating 
</p>
<p>vision; generating concepts relevant to the change; championing those concepts

<p>through organizational networks; creating communities of practice that explore, test 
</p>
<p>and translate those concepts into actions and new practices, followed by creating 
</p>
<p>new business models and management processes. The core concepts that senior 
</p>
<p>management championed were closed material loops and clean technological appli-
</p>
<p>cations and they committed a sixfold increased R&amp;D budget to develop these con-
</p>
<p>cepts. In this way, a vision for the company developed such that it would define its 
</p>
<p>future as providing material solutions to environmental problems while ensuring 
</p>
<p>that the company&rsquo;s operations accorded with the highest possible environmental 
</p>
<p>standards. At the core of the new culture were organisational learning and innova-
</p>
<p>tion for change. Umicore now is one of the best financially performing firms in the 
</p>
<p>sector with a total return on capital consistently around 9%.

<p>Chapter 25: IBM and Sustainability: Creating a Smarter Planet by Gilbert 
</p>
<p>G.&nbsp;Lenssen and N.&nbsp;Craig Smith
</p>
<p>IBM&rsquo;s Let&rsquo;s Create a Smarter Planet was launched in 2008 not by an ad campaign, 
</p>
<p>as such, but by a serious speech of then CEO Sam Palmisano to the Council for 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs in Washington. He explained how IBM wanted to contribute to a 
</p>
<p>better, more sustainable world by leveraging the availability of data and networks. 
</p>
<p>IBM communicated that it had something important to announce to the world, 
</p>
<p>clearly going beyond a traditional marketing campaign for a new line of products 
</p>
<p>and services. This was quickly followed up by a series of long text thought leader-
</p>
<p>ship pieces in leading newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times 
</p>
<p>and the Financial Times to highlight how forward-thinking leaders in business, gov-
</p>
<p>ernment and civil society around the world can capture the potential of smarter 
</p>
<p>systems to achieve economic growth, near-term efficiency, sustainable develop-
</p>
<p>ment, and societal progress. In 2010, Sam Palmisano followed up with another 
</p>
<p>important speech at Chatham House in London, highlighting dozens of initiatives in 
</p>
<p>which smarter systems were being created to solve the planet&rsquo;s most pressing prob-
</p>
<p>lems. The speech aimed to inspire others to follow the leads of these innovators by 
</p>
<p>helping to create a smarter planet. The case is a unique example of a major &ldquo;shared 
</p>
<p>value&rdquo; initiative, but also of a business model transformation aimed at capturing the 
</p>
<p>high value of sustainability up the value chain. Finally, IBM&rsquo;s initiative is hailed by 
</p>
<p>marketing scholars and practitioners as revolutionary in the way it gets its messages 
</p>
<p>across and maintains momentum, not in the least by employing a &ldquo;Chief Story 
</p>
<p>Teller&rdquo; who gives the business successes a story-like narrative with human faces. It 
</p>
<p>has been an outstanding success. The case asks the question: is it a long-term sus-
</p>
<p>tainable business model within the competitive landscape?

<p>Chapter 26: Waste Concern: Fixing Market Failures by Joanna Wylegala and 
</p>
<p>Christian Selos
</p>
<p>Sustainable development challenges give ample opportunities for large companies, 
</p>
<p>but also for entrepreneurs at the grassroots. Originating from an NGO undertaking 
</p>
<p>research in waste management, Waste Concern became a for-profit enterprise 
</p>
<p>inspired by the compelling idea of turning a massive problem (uncollected, unpro-
</p>
<p>cessed waste in Dhaka, the mega capital city of Bangladesh) into a business oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity, thereby creating value for multiple stakeholders: the city inhabitants, local 
</p>
<p>government, farmers, as well as making good returns for the business. A small scale 
</p>
<p>decentralised model was piloted of house-to-house collection, composting in small 
</p>
<p>plants, and marketing the compost as organic fertiliser to improve agricultural yields 
</p>
<p>and reduce the toxic and land destroying use of chemical fertilisers. The newly cre-
</p>
<p>ated value chain addressed major challenges. First, the hazards caused by largely 
</p>
<p>uncollected or unsafely disposed waste in a city of over 11&nbsp;m inhabitants (and grow-
</p>
<p>ing). Second, population growth far exceeding agricultural crop output due to 
</p>
<p>improper waste management and the misuse of millions of tons of chemical fertil-
</p>
<p>iser. To help address these major challenges, the small entrepreneurial venture needs 
</p>
<p>to scale up quickly and face the critical organisational, operational, and financial 
</p>
<p>choices to be made.
</p>
<p>Chapter 27: Uber and the Ethics of Sharing: Exploring the Societal Promises 
</p>
<p>and Responsibilities of the Sharing Economy by N.&nbsp;Craig Smith and Erin 
</p>
<p>McCormick
</p>
<p>Business models like those of Uber (transportation services by cars) and Airbnb 
</p>
<p>(lodging services in private homes) with little more than an investment in a website 
</p>
<p>are growing fast from small entrepreneurial start-ups to global scale companies and 
</p>
<p>proving to be very profitable. They claim to contribute to the better-shared use of 
</p>
<p>underutilised assets like private cars and apartments and therefore to increased envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental sustainability. The business model is disruptive, undermining the profit-
</p>
<p>ability of taxi companies and hotels in serious ways, a case example of creative 
</p>
<p>destruction, which is inherent to growth by innovation in a market economy. However, 
</p>
<p>the ethos of sharing is increasingly brought into discredit by accusations of creating 
</p>
<p>a black economy with hidden employment, evasion of taxes, and omitted contribu-
</p>
<p>tions to a social security system already under strain. To its critics, this black econ-
</p>
<p>omy replaces an established economy which contributes to regular employment of a 
</p>
<p>vast number of lowly skilled workers in the taxi and hotel industry, pays corporate 
</p>
<p>and income taxes and social security contributions. This &ldquo;sharing economy&rdquo; also 
</p>
<p>poses regulatory challenges with respect to fair competition, safety standards and 
</p>
<p>consumer protection. Is the social cost of environmental gains too high? Or is this the 
</p>
<p>price to be paid for disruptive innovation that promises future growth?

<p>22Business Model Innovations for&nbsp;Sustainability
Lindsay&nbsp;Clinton and&nbsp;Ryan&nbsp;Whisnant
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Business models&mdash;the underlying structures of how companies create, deliver and 
</p>
<p>capture value&mdash;form the engine of our economy. They determine the speed at which 
</p>
<p>economies grow, and the intensity at which our resources are consumed. They deter-
</p>
<p>mine the number and type of jobs in our cities, the provenance of the products we 
</p>
<p>buy, and the price of the food we eat. They contribute to the quality of our communi-
</p>
<p>ties and our lives.
</p>
<p>The idea of business model innovation&mdash;specifically, that a company could 
</p>
<p>launch a new business model never conceived of before, or transform an existing 
</p>
<p>business model to disrupt an industry&mdash;captivates business leaders and sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity advocates alike.
</p>
<p>Such is the enthusiasm for business models that a new vocabulary has emerged 
</p>
<p>for the scale of the impact we seek: Transformational. Step change. Breakthrough. 
</p>
<p>We also recognize the importance of incremental steps that add up to big change. 
</p>
<p>No matter the speed or type, we all want to understand what innovations are occur-
</p>
<p>ring and how innovation happens. For business leaders, understanding and advanc-
</p>
<p>ing innovation is necessary to beat competitors. For sustainability practitioners, 
</p>
<p>innovation is key to meeting expanding human needs within planetary limits.
</p>
<p>Many existing business models are predicated on the assumption that vital, 
</p>
<p>non-financial resources&mdash;i.e., natural, human and/or social capital&mdash;are in 
</p>
<p>virtually limitless supply.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>The inner workings of a business model&mdash;its products and processes, its interac-
</p>
<p>tions with stakeholders, what and how it measures, the transactions it requires&mdash;
</p>
<p>influence a company&rsquo;s ability to thrive in the future, and shape its impacts on people 
</p>
<p>and planet.
</p>
<p>But many existing business models are predicated on the assumption that vital, 
</p>
<p>non-financial resources&mdash;i.e., natural, human and/or social capital&mdash;are in virtually 
</p>
<p>limitless supply. Societal benefit, if considered at all, is frequently an after-thought. 
</p>
<p>To truly create a more sustainable world that can thrive over time, we need business 
</p>
<p>models that operate within planetary limits and are sensitive to their roles as eco-
</p>
<p>nomic, environmental and social linchpins.
</p>
<p>To date, many companies have realized the merits of modifying their products 
</p>
<p>and processes to become more sustainable. Acknowledging the business benefits of 
</p>
<p>improved product performance, some have revamped their offerings to be more 
</p>
<p>effective, more efficient and produced with safer, &ldquo;greener&rdquo; materials. Other com-
</p>
<p>panies have rethought their processes&mdash;for example, by utilizing renewable energy 
</p>
<p>sources in production or enhancing performance and trust through various certifica-
</p>
<p>tions. But, these innovations will only get us so far. What we need are not just better 
</p>
<p>products and processes, but fundamentally different business models. We need com-
</p>
<p>panies and industries whose underlying structures are, at worst, zero negative 
</p>
<p>impact, and at best, contributing to the regeneration and restoration of natural, 
</p>
<p>human and social capital.
</p>
<p>Examples of more sustainable business models exist today, and more are being 
</p>
<p>invented by creative entrepreneurs and intrapraneurs around the world. There is a 
</p>
<p>need to better understand what makes these models work, where innovation is hap-
</p>
<p>pening and how companies with traditional models can transform to become more 
</p>
<p>sustainable and more profitable.
</p>
<p>This report takes a closer look at business model innovation, examining its real- 
</p>
<p>world applicability toward advancing sustainability. We explore where business 
</p>
<p>model innovation is happening, what models are emerging and what role multina-
</p>
<p>tional companies play in the business model innovation landscape, along with a 
</p>
<p>snapshot of how some large companies are experimenting with business model 
</p>
<p>innovation.
</p>
<p>In sharing this research, we intend to shed light on the business model innovation 
</p>
<p>space and identify useful patterns and practices, specifically as they enable more 
</p>
<p>sustainable outcomes. We hope these findings spur a deeper exploration of business 
</p>
<p>model innovation and provide actionable tools across a diverse audience, including 
</p>
<p>sustainability and corporate responsibility leaders, corporate innovation and strat-
</p>
<p>egy teams, social entrepreneurs and environmental economists, among others.
</p>
<p>What we need are not just better products and processes, but fundamen-
</p>
<p>tally different business models.

</p>
<p> What Do We&nbsp;Mean by &ldquo;Business Model&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>The sustainability field has had a longstanding preoccupation with the promise of 
</p>
<p>business model innovation. We&rsquo;ve seen a good amount of hype, with surges of inter-
</p>
<p>est around topics like social innovation and the sharing economy, and frequently 
</p>
<p>cited examples like Grameen Bank and Zipcar. But despite all the talk, the topic of 
</p>
<p>business model innovation still lacks the clarity to fully deliver on its promise.
</p>
<p>Like &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo;, the term &ldquo;business model&rdquo; is used rather loosely. One has 
</p>
<p>the sense that everyone is referring more or less to the same thing, but what exactly? 
</p>
<p>Put another way, if a company comes up with a new business model, what is it that 
</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve changed?
</p>
<p>Many have attempted to define the term. Innovation researchers Osterwalder and 
</p>
<p>Pigneur offer an inclusive and succinct definition in their 2010 work, Business 
</p>
<p>Model Generation.1 It defines business models as the &ldquo;fundamental structures for 
</p>
<p>how companies create, deliver and capture value.&rdquo; Raphael Amit and Christoph Zott 
</p>
<p>offer a somewhat lengthier definition in the MIT Sloan Review: &ldquo;The bundle of 
</p>
<p>specific activities conducted to satisfy the perceived needs of the market, along with 
</p>
<p>the specification of which parties conduct which activities, and how these activities 
</p>
<p>are linked to each other.&rdquo;2 This and other definitions clearly point to the fact that a 
</p>
<p>business model encompasses more than just what the company produces.
</p>
<p>According to a 2013 study by BCG and MIT,3 nearly half of the companies sur-
</p>
<p>veyed said they had &ldquo;changed their business models as a result of sustainability 
</p>
<p>opportunities.&rdquo; However, more often than not, the innovations we see involve creat-
</p>
<p>ing better processes and/or products, without addressing the underlying value 
</p>
<p>structure.
</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that product or process innovations aren&rsquo;t needed or useful; in 
</p>
<p>some cases, they may even support or lead directly to a significant change in a 
</p>
<p>model. For example, consider when Walmart committed in 2010 to double its sourc-
</p>
<p>ing of local produce by 2015. On first inspection this may sound like an issue of 
</p>
<p>process. But to meet the objective demanded a range of responses&mdash;paying farmers

</p>
<p>more, offering customers a money-back guarantee, and changing the way produce 
</p>
<p>is stocked in-store&mdash;which cumulatively represented a more fundamental shift in 
</p>
<p>the business model. By sharing income differently along the value chain and assign-
</p>
<p>ing higher value to things previously externalized, Walmart engineered more sus-
</p>
<p>tainable outcomes directly into the structure of the business.
</p>
<p>Business model innovation for sustainability ultimately involves a novel form of 
</p>
<p>exchange at some point along a company&rsquo;s value chain. That exchange, sometimes 
</p>
<p>completely new, other times just different, creates new value or distributes value 
</p>
<p>more equitably for more stakeholders.
</p>
<p>The most straightforward is an exchange between a company and its customers. 
</p>
<p>The development of power purchase agreements (PPAs) for solar projects, pio-
</p>
<p>neered by SunEdison, provides a good example of a change in how a solar provider, 
</p>
<p>in this case, captures revenue from its customers. Using PPAs has lowered the bar-
</p>
<p>rier for commercial and industrial customers to adopt solar because there is no 
</p>
<p>upfront cost. SunEdison&rsquo;s customers get cleaner energy at lower rates than com-
</p>
<p>mercial power while also taking advantage of renewable energy credits. The use of 
</p>
<p>the PPA helps spread the use of renewable energy and lower costs, providing more 
</p>
<p>value to customers and the system at-large.
</p>
<p>Other examples of novel exchanges that provide value to more stakeholders can 
</p>
<p>be found in interactions between a company and its suppliers (e.g., SAB Miller 
</p>
<p>sourcing from disadvantaged cassava farmers), a company and its employees (e.g., 
</p>
<p>the cooperative ownership structure at Ocean Spray) or a company and its commu-
</p>
<p>nity (e.g., TwoDegrees providing a meal to a hungry child for every health bar sold).
</p>
<p>In each case, the value created in the transaction is no longer concentrated among 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s owners or shareholders, but is distributed more equitably, usually 
</p>
<p>shifting social and environmental outcomes along the way.
</p>
<p>As a company considers its business model structure, the exchanges that occur at 
</p>
<p>all points within the business model present opportunities to innovate, distribute 
</p>
<p>value, and shift outcomes for the better.
</p>
<p>Business model innovation ultimately involves a novel form of exchange at 
</p>
<p>some point along a company&rsquo;s value chain.

</p>
<p> Why Business Model Innovation Matters
</p>
<p>SustainAbility and GlobeScan&rsquo;s 2013 report Changing Tack4 spells out the urgent 
</p>
<p>need for fundamentally different approaches to value creation. For companies 
</p>
<p>looking to respond to this mounting urgency while reaping the financial benefits, 
</p>
<p>moving beyond product and process modifications to business model innovation 
</p>
<p>is vital.
</p>
<p>Process and product innovation are not enough to generate both sustainability 
</p>
<p>and financial performance.
</p>
<p>Many novel or even radical new process or product innovations have fallen 
</p>
<p>short of their potential because they were unable to compete within the constraints 
</p>
<p>of an existing or traditional business model. Shifts in the underlying model are 
</p>
<p>necessary to enable the innovative product or process to succeed in the 
</p>
<p>marketplace.
</p>
<p>One useful illustration of the power of business model innovation is LifeStraw, 
</p>
<p>which has a growing foothold in the developing world. LifeStraw&rsquo;s product&nbsp; &ndash; a 
</p>
<p>personal use straw designed to remove 99.9999% of all waterborne bacteria and 
</p>
<p>99.99% of parasites&nbsp;&ndash; is certainly innovative. But the product is only successful if it 
</p>
<p>gets into the hands of people who need it, particularly those with less access to clean 
</p>
<p>water. This is where LifeStraw&rsquo;s business model comes in: it relies on a unique 
</p>
<p>approach to financing. The company received funding from a carbon credit market, 
</p>
<p>allowing it to offer products at low- to no-cost in certain areas. The carbon credits 
</p>
<p>are earned by eliminating the need for families to cut down trees for firewood to boil 
</p>
<p>and purify water.5
</p>
<p>Another example is a start-up based out of Stanford University, re.source, which 
</p>
<p>produces low-cost mobile toilets for residents of dense urban slums who don&rsquo;t have 
</p>
<p>access to hygienic sanitation services. Rather than try to find someone to buy the 
</p>
<p>toilets, the company has created a business model that blends affordable monthly 
</p>
<p>membership, waste collection services and processing of waste into useful products 
</p>
<p>such as organic fertilizers and energy.6

</p>
<p>New business models can transform industries.
</p>
<p>The biggest reason for companies to embrace business model innovation is the 
</p>
<p>threat that current models will ultimately slip or even fail. Examples of business 
</p>
<p>models that have quickly transformed or even become obsolete abound across sec-
</p>
<p>tors including media (decline of print), retail (online retailing and sharing plat-
</p>
<p>forms), music (digital music services like Spotify and iTunes), telecommunications 
</p>
<p>(proliferation of smart devices and associated services) and even finance (peer-to- 
</p>
<p>peer lending).
</p>
<p>In healthcare, Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospitals, winner of a Financial Times 
</p>
<p>2013 Boldness in Business award, uses a combination of process efficiency, revenue 
</p>
<p>and cost structure and financing to make a profit while providing access to vital 
</p>
<p>healthcare services for both rich and poor.7 The company&rsquo;s work is beginning to 
</p>
<p>change the way medical providers in India think about the cost, quality and reach of 
</p>

</p>
<p>Many traditional business models that still appear viable today do so as a result 
</p>
<p>of mispriced resources and other market distortions that make them more competi-
</p>
<p>tive than they would otherwise be. As sustainability trends and challenges&mdash;includ-
</p>
<p>ing energy and commodity price fluctuation, supply insecurity or demands for 
</p>
<p>transparency&mdash;continue to shift the foundations of our current business models, 
</p>
<p>along with our expectations around them, incremental innovation will become less 
</p>
<p>effective in enabling companies to adapt and succeed.
</p>
<p>Take the energy industry: incumbent utilities are facing startups like Mosaic, a 
</p>
<p>solar company that offers an easy-to-use crowdfunding investment model enabling 
</p>
<p>small individual investors to fund large commercial solar projects. This and similar 
</p>
<p>models are opening a door to more democratized systems, away from traditional 
</p>
<p>command-and-control business models where centralized operators decide what 
</p>
<p>investments to make&mdash;in coal versus solar, for instance. This type of business model 
</p>
<p>innovation is gaining more attention as it begins to challenge the established posi-
</p>
<p>tion of traditional fossil fuel-based energy producers.
</p>
<p>Business model innovation both catalyzes and relies on broader systems change.
</p>
<p>According to the MIT report Creating Value Through Business Model Innovation, 
</p>
<p>it is important to innovate in areas where the competition is unable or unwilling to 
</p>
<p>act&mdash;where competitors might find it more difficult to imitate or replicate an entire 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;activity system.&rdquo;9 The classic example is Apple&mdash;the iPod would not have been the 
</p>
<p>game changer that it was without the ecosystem created by iTunes. The resulting 
</p>
<p>system dramatically changed how we acquire, store and listen to music, and made 
</p>
<p>Apple the go-to provider of this new and better experience.
</p>
<p>To innovate within systems, companies need the capability to adapt to shifting 
</p>
<p>market conditions and larger systemic changes. They also need to be able to create 
</p>
<p>systemic change, build new markets, and avoid or dampen the impacts from dra-
</p>
<p>matic systems shifts. To do so, companies must be willing to see beyond the obvi-
</p>
<p>ous, short-term business case with an eye to the viability of the broader system.
</p>
<p>The demise of Better Place in early 2013 provides a cautionary tale and an illus-
</p>
<p>tration of the need for larger systems change. The electric car venture based on an 
</p>
<p>innovative battery-swapping technology and a &ldquo;subscription model&rdquo; (see Business 
</p>
<p>Model Innovation section below) sold only 750 cars, while amassing losses of more 
</p>
<p>than $500 million.10 Ultimately, the success of Better Place depended on changes in

<p>the broader system&mdash;changes that never materialized&mdash;including tax and/or subsidy 
</p>
<p>support, local government approval in building battery-switching stations, and 
</p>
<p>design partnerships from automakers.
</p>
<p> Research Approach
</p>
<p>In order to explore and better understand business model innovation, we combed 
</p>
<p>recent reports, news articles and blogs and identified over 100 of companies cited 
</p>
<p>for their forward-thinking approaches. We catalogued these innovations, and cate-
</p>
<p>gorized them according to industry, company size, geography and type of innova-
</p>
<p>tion (product, process or business model), resulting in a winnowing of the list to 87 
</p>
<p>business model innovation examples. We then analyzed each example, and for those 
</p>
<p>companies that had changed an established business model or launched a new one, 
</p>
<p>we identified patterns in the particular types of models, such as dematerialization, 
</p>
<p>alternative marketplace or product as a service.
</p>
<p>We identify and define 20 distinct types of business model innovation. For each 
</p>
<p>type, we discuss what makes the model unique and relevant to sustainability, what 
</p>
<p>differentiates it from a more traditional model, what novel exchange is occurring, 
</p>
<p>and any shifts in incentives.
</p>
<p>For each model, we also give an example of a company demonstrating that 
</p>
<p>model, and list a few other manifestations, where available, of other companies 
</p>
<p>using the model.
</p>
<p>Lastly, we&rsquo;ve grouped the models into &ldquo;meta&rdquo; categories that help to demon-
</p>
<p>strate similarities to other models&rsquo; impacts, as well as their differences.
</p>
<p> Caveats
</p>
<p> Purity
</p>
<p>In our review, we documented examples that, while innovative, may not meet some 
</p>
<p>readers&rsquo; expectations for a &ldquo;sustainable business.&rdquo; Our goal is not to point out per-
</p>
<p>fectly sustainable business models, but rather to highlight examples of companies, 
</p>
<p>new or incumbent, that have done something innovative to yield more sustainable 
</p>
<p>outcomes. It is from these examples that we believe others can learn, and by which 
</p>
<p>they will be inspired to innovate further, or simply be compelled to follow suit.
</p>
<p> Hybrid Models
</p>
<p>Some business models fit into multiple categories. For example, the eyeglass maker 
</p>
<p>Warby Parker has elements of a physical to virtual model, and it also uses a buy one 
</p>
<p>give one model focused on building social capital. Mud Jeans, an online market-
</p>
<p>place where customers rent jeans on a monthly basis, has element of physical to 
</p>
<p>L. Clinton and R. Whisnant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>471
</p>
<p>virtual and innovative product financing. Business model innovation is more art 
</p>
<p>than science, and we expect other business models to emerge that exhibit more than 
</p>
<p>one defining structure.
</p>
<p> Intent to&nbsp;Produce Sustainable Outcomes
</p>
<p>Innovations that produce unintentional sustainability benefits are not uncommon. 
</p>
<p>Netflix, for instance, helped to dematerialize the movie rental industry by first leap-
</p>
<p>frogging brick-and-mortar stores, and eventually eliminating the need for DVDs by 
</p>
<p>offering streaming content. While Netflix certainly has a good sustainability story to 
</p>
<p>tell, it did not set out with the intent to improve its sustainability performance.
</p>
<p>As we sifted through business model innovation examples, we considered 
</p>
<p>whether to include examples that are not values-led, so to speak. We decided that we 
</p>
<p>should do so because what matters is the outcome, rather than the intention. To drive 
</p>
<p>the sustainability agenda, we must be responsive to any innovation, not just those 
</p>
<p>intended for sustainable outcomes.
</p>
<p> Business Model Innovations for&nbsp;Sustainability
</p>
<p> Environmental Impact
</p>
<p>Closed Loop Production In this model, the material used to create a product is 
</p>
<p>continually recycled through the production system. Every effort is made to reduce 
</p>
<p>waste in the production system, and those elements that cannot be eliminated are 
</p>
<p>recaptured and reused or biodegraded and composted.11 Few if any outside inputs 
</p>
<p>are needed.
</p>
<p>This model upsets the more traditional, linear take-make-waste production pat-
</p>
<p>tern that most manufacturing companies currently rely on.
</p>
<p>Employing this model not only reduces material- and energy-related costs, but 
</p>
<p>can also provide additional opportunities for interaction with consumers who re- 
</p>
<p>engage with the company to facilitate product take back.12
</p>
<p>Others might refer to this model as &ldquo;cradle to cradle.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Novelis: This global aluminum company, headquartered in Atlanta, 
</p>
<p>GA, and owned by Hindalco (a member company of the Indian conglomerate, 
</p>
<p>Aditya Birla Group) is the global leader in rolled aluminum products. Novelis 
</p>
<p>creates 14% of the world&rsquo;s rolled aluminum products like beverage cans, archi-
</p>
<p>tectural structures and consumer electronics.

</p>
<p> &ndash; The company currently sources 43% of its aluminum from recycled materials 
</p>
<p>and has a goal of reaching 80% by 2020.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Novelis aims to develop an almost entirely closed-loop business model by sourc-
</p>
<p>ing more recycled aluminum, coordinating post-production scrap take back, 
</p>
<p>arranging end-of-life product take back, and building more of its own recycling 
</p>
<p>operations and processing facilities.13
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Interface makes carpet tiles from reclaimed and recycled carpet and is aim-
</p>
<p>ing for zero waste, zero emissions, and zero use of oil by 2020.
</p>
<p>Physical to Virtual The consumer marketplace was once almost exclusively com-
</p>
<p>prised of brick and mortar stores&mdash;the corner store, grocery store, big box store or 
</p>
<p>shopping mall. That model, of erecting a store on every corner or in every town, 
</p>
<p>provides convenience, but can be resource-intensive and expensive.
</p>
<p>The physical-to-virtual model eliminates brick and mortar infrastructure to dra-
</p>
<p>matically reduce the resources needed to supply a product to a consumer. It changes 
</p>
<p>where and how a transaction happens. As consumers become more comfortable 
</p>
<p>with virtual shopping, we will likely see fewer retail outposts and more online-only 
</p>
<p>brands, like FreshDirect, the grocery-delivery company.
</p>
<p>Some companies in this category, such as Netflix, achieved greater environmen-
</p>
<p>tal sustainability through this innovation. It&rsquo;s important to note that in augmenting 
</p>
<p>some environmental elements of sustainability, this business model innovation may 
</p>
<p>eliminate jobs, thereby creating questions about social sustainability.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Sungevity: This residential solar installation and financing company 
</p>
<p>has streamlined the way solar panels are sold to individual consumers.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Rather than relying on local retail outlets or representatives, Sungevity has devel-
</p>
<p>oped a scalable online sales model where customers can get a price quote within 
</p>
<p>24&nbsp;hours. A team of remote engineers designs the solar systems based on satellite 
</p>
<p>imagery. Sungevity subcontracts the installation work to smaller, local 
</p>
<p>operators.
</p>
<p> &ndash; This capital-light model has enabled the company to streamline its processes and 
</p>
<p>has resulted in quick expansion to new markets across the US and to countries 
</p>
<p>around the world.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Bonobos made its name selling a single product&mdash;men&rsquo;s pants&mdash;online.
</p>
<p>&bull; Fresh Direct delivers groceries straight to consumers&rsquo; doors.
</p>
<p>&bull; SPUD (Sustainable Produce Urban Delivery), in Boston, supplies mostly 
</p>
<p>local produce to consumers via an online marketplace.
</p>
<p>&bull; Warby Parker sells eyeglasses online and mails consumers four pairs to 
</p>
<p>choose from to mimic the brick and mortar retail experience.

</p>
<p>Produce on Demand Here, a company produces a product only when consumer 
</p>
<p>demand has been quantified and confirmed. Companies do so via online platforms 
</p>
<p>that enable consumers to design their own products, vote on preferred product ele-
</p>
<p>ments, and in some cases engage with other consumers in product creation. In the 
</p>
<p>process of interacting with the brand and customizing its products, consumers can 
</p>
<p>develop stronger, stickier relationships with the company.
</p>
<p>From an environmental efficiency standpoint, the company benefits; it does not 
</p>
<p>have to over-produce and over-stock products because demand is confirmed. 
</p>
<p>This model presents a streamlined approach to production, as supply meets 
</p>
<p>demand exactly, thus reducing extraneous material in the production cycle.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Lego Cuusoo: This Lego offshoot is an online platform, created 
</p>
<p>through a partnership between the Japanese company CUUSOO and The Lego 
</p>
<p>Group in 2008, which allows users to submit ideas for Lego products to be turned 
</p>
<p>into potential sets available commercially, with the original designer receiving 
</p>
<p>1% of the royalties.14
</p>
<p> &ndash; Lego Cuusoo engages consumers in a new way by including them in the design 
</p>
<p>process and sharing revenue. The revenue sharing agreement incentivizes exist-
</p>
<p>ing and new consumers to interact with the brand.
</p>
<p> &ndash; While there is no sustainability intent behind this example, if scaled, it could 
</p>
<p>streamline production and consumption.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Threadless is a t-shirt company that invites artists to create designs, which 
</p>
<p>users vote on; the most popular ones go into production; designers receive 
</p>
<p>monetary compensation by the company.
</p>
<p>&bull; Walkers, the chip and crisp maker in the UK, experimented with this model 
</p>
<p>in 2008 by allowing consumers to create and vote on new flavors to put into 
</p>
<p>production.
</p>
<p>Rematerialization In this model, a company&rsquo;s source material is derived from 
</p>
<p>recovering waste, with which the company develops and markets a new output. This 
</p>
<p>model differs from closed loop production in that the company is creating an entirely 
</p>
<p>new product from the source material. This process often requires complex technol-
</p>
<p>ogy to break down discarded material and remanufacture it.
</p>
<p>Companies using this model have benefitted from an increasing focus by other 
</p>
<p>businesses on eliminating waste to landfill. Businesses with reduced or zero waste 
</p>
<p>to landfill targets are more inclined to pay to have their waste material repurposed 
</p>
<p>so that they can reach their goals.
</p>
<p>14 While this example is more process-oriented than others, we wanted to highlight a large company 
using this model. The other companies named are in fact using this production method as their 
business model.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>474
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Waste Management: The North American company provides waste 
</p>
<p>disposal and recycling solutions that divert waste from landfill, transform waste 
</p>
<p>into higher value materials and create clean, renewable energy.
</p>
<p> &ndash; For example, due to its landfill-gas-to-energy efforts that recover naturally occur-
</p>
<p>ring gas inside landfills, Waste Management currently produces more than twice 
</p>
<p>the amount of renewable electricity as the entire US solar industry. The company 
</p>
<p>also has plans to invest in new recycling technologies, like converting organic 
</p>
<p>waste from the materials stream to make high-end compost for local growers.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Knowaste recycles disposable diapers and feminine hygiene products into 
</p>
<p>plastic components, cardboard and construction filler.
</p>
<p>&bull; LeHigh Technologies takes scrap rubber from customers that have zero waste 
</p>
<p>initiatives, processes it and resells it to consumer goods, construction, tire and 
</p>
<p>flooring customers to make new products.
</p>
<p>&bull; Rubies in the Rubble takes surplus fruits and vegetables before they&rsquo;re dis-
</p>
<p>carded and makes them into chutneys that are sold in UK markets; in so doing, 
</p>
<p>they provide employment to those struggling to get into the workforce.
</p>
<p> Social Impact
</p>
<p>Buy One, Give One Companies using this model sell a specific good/service and 
</p>
<p>use a portion of the profits to donate a similar good/service to those in need. 
</p>
<p>Consumers are compelled to purchase not only for the benefit of acquiring the new 
</p>
<p>product, but also for the personal uplift that comes from feeling generous. These 
</p>
<p>models often depend on a strong brand story to draw in consumers and to ensure 
</p>
<p>that they spread the word.
</p>
<p>The model has been used most frequently by consumer goods companies, in 
</p>
<p>particular the apparel and accessories space, whose consumers use their purchases 
</p>
<p>to express their style, and as a platform for sharing information on the benefits pro-
</p>
<p>vided to others through those purchases.15
</p>
<p>Companies using this model usually make donations by setting aside a share of 
</p>
<p>the profits. The companies charge a premium for their product or accept a lower 
</p>
<p>profit margin with the hope of selling more units because consumers are attracted to 
</p>
<p>the cause.16
</p>
<p>This model differs from the traditional corporate separation of the business and 
</p>
<p>its philanthropic efforts, often through a foundation arm. It explicitly builds social 
</p>
<p>impact into the business, so that it is front and center, rather than something that 
</p>
<p>occurs after shareholders have been compensated.

</p>
<p>While growing in popularity, the model has come under fire for its social impact 
</p>
<p>claims; some see the product donations made through these models as overly sim-
</p>
<p>plistic approaches to large, complex social problems.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: TwoDegrees: TwoDegrees sells nutrition bars direct to consumer and 
</p>
<p>through retail outlets. For every TwoDegrees bar purchased, the company pro-
</p>
<p>vides a meal to a hungry child. The company does this by forming partnerships 
</p>
<p>with nonprofit organizations that provide food assistance through health clinics, 
</p>
<p>schools, and community groups in areas where children are suffering from mal-
</p>
<p>nutrition or chronic hunger.
</p>
<p> &ndash; A box of nine bars sells for $17.95 on the company&rsquo;s website. According to 
</p>
<p>TwoDegrees&rsquo; 2013 report, they have donated 767,688 meals. Where possible, the 
</p>
<p>company reports, they donate meals that are produced locally, using local labor 
</p>
<p>and sourcing local ingredients in the region where meals are distributed.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; SoapBox Soaps donates one bar of soap for each purchased with the hope of 
</p>
<p>spreading good hygiene among low-income populations.
</p>
<p>&bull; TOM&rsquo;s Shoes donates one pair of shoes for every pair purchased.
</p>
<p>Cooperative Ownership A business that is owned and managed by members is 
</p>
<p>called a cooperative or co-op. Members can be retail consumers, users of services, 
</p>
<p>tenants (housing co-ops), savers and borrowers (credit unions) or employees.17 
</p>
<p>Whereas a traditional shareholder model focuses almost exclusively on meeting 
</p>
<p>investor expectations, a cooperative model often takes broader stakeholder concerns 
</p>
<p>into account, including those of employees, customers, suppliers, the local commu-
</p>
<p>nity and in some cases, the environment.
</p>
<p>The novel form of exchange here is the distribution of greater value to more 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in the company ecosystem.
</p>
<p>From a social impact standpoint, co-ops often excel because their structure 
</p>
<p>allows for distributed&mdash;and often more equitable&mdash;decision making, profit sharing 
</p>
<p>and power sharing. Cooperative worker models often provide a sense of ownership 
</p>
<p>to employees, who are incentivized by playing a direct role in profit generation and 
</p>
<p>profit sharing. Cooperative retail models often pay members dividends or offer 
</p>
<p>members in-store discounts.
</p>
<p>Several co-op models, like The Cooperative Group and Fagor, part of the worker 
</p>
<p>co-op Mondragon, have recently come under fire for ethical issues or financial mis-
</p>
<p>management. The non-hierarchical structure of co-ops can translate into fewer 
</p>
<p>checks and balances than more traditional ownership structures.18

<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Ocean Spray: Many who drink the juice sold by Ocean Spray prob-
</p>
<p>ably don&rsquo;t realize that the company, which brings in around $2 billion in revenue 
</p>
<p>each year, is an agricultural cooperative of 750 cranberry and grapefruit growers. 
</p>
<p>These farmers are the only shareholders in the company.
</p>
<p> &ndash; As a result, Ocean Spray&rsquo;s farmers get paid well for the fruits of their labor; 
</p>
<p>whereas the market price for a barrel of cranberries in 2009 was $20, Ocean 
</p>
<p>Spray farmers received $64 a barrel. CEO Randy Pappadelis explains, &ldquo;We seek 
</p>
<p>to pay as much for those cranberries as we can, to compensate our grower- 
</p>
<p>owners&hellip;the model validates the value of goodwill.&rdquo;19
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Amul, a dairy cooperative in India, is comprised of 3 million milk producers
</p>
<p>&bull; The Co-operative Group in the UK is owned and run by more than 7.2 mil-
</p>
<p>lion members
</p>
<p>&bull; John Lewis Partnership is an employee-owned UK company which oper-
</p>
<p>ates department stores, Waitrose supermarkets and some other services
</p>
<p>&bull; Vancity is a financial co-op in Canada with nearly 500,000 member-owners
</p>
<p>&bull; REI is a private US-based retail company structured as a consumer 
</p>
<p>cooperative.
</p>
<p>Inclusive Sourcing As companies consider their impacts outside of core opera-
</p>
<p>tions, one of the first targets is the supply chain. Setting supplier standards or con-
</p>
<p>ducting audits are first steps toward sustainable sourcing, but others go even further. 
</p>
<p>They retool their supply chains to make them more inclusive, focusing on support-
</p>
<p>ing the farmer or producer providing the product, not just the qualities of the prod-
</p>
<p>uct sourced (e.g., organic palm oil, sustainable timber).
</p>
<p>Inclusive sourcing often means working with small farmers, which can require 
</p>
<p>more effort on the part of large corporations. But, working with small holders and 
</p>
<p>local farmers creates market connections, increases farmer learning and access, and 
</p>
<p>makes for stronger links in the supply chain overall.20
</p>
<p>Building inclusive supply chains can help build reputational value for large com-
</p>
<p>panies, but beyond that it can help companies gain legitimacy in&nbsp;local markets and 
</p>
<p>create more &lsquo;ethical&rsquo; products. The benefits can translate into better traceability and 
</p>
<p>supply consistency through stronger supplier relationships.
</p>
<p>Last year, we witnessed in rapid succession the collapse of a Bangladesh apparel 
</p>
<p>factory and a factory fire there&mdash;examples of supply chain disruption and

</p>
<p>reputational damage due to a lack of attention to supplier livelihoods. Some compa-
</p>
<p>nies have realized that it is smart business to practice inclusive sourcing to avoid 
</p>
<p>disruptions like this, bolster reputation, and strengthen supply chains.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Walmart: For several years, Walmart has had a plan in place to source 
</p>
<p>more food directly from farmers, cutting out middlemen, and enabling farmers to 
</p>
<p>boost their income. In some countries, this has meant fresher, more local produce 
</p>
<p>for customers.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Part of Walmart&rsquo;s plan includes providing training to 1 million farmers and farm 
</p>
<p>workers in crop selection and sustainable farming, as well as a goal to increase 
</p>
<p>small- and medium-sized farmer income by 10&ndash;15%. By sourcing directly from 
</p>
<p>farmers, Walmart aims to strengthen local farms and economies.21
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Interface, the carpet tile company, sources discarded fishing nets from small 
</p>
<p>fishing villages in the Philippines to make its Net Effect carpet line.
</p>
<p>&bull; Novelis&rsquo; aluminum processing center in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam will source 
</p>
<p>from local low-income trash collectors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Sylva Foods is a Zambian SME that aims to grow demand for and increase 
</p>
<p>sales of traditional Zambian foods by working with rural farmers; retail 
</p>
<p>shelves in Zambia are currently dominated by imported food products.
</p>
<p> Financial Innovation
</p>
<p>Crowdfunding Crowdfunding enables an entrepreneur or company to tap the 
</p>
<p>resources of an entire network to raise money in increments from a group of people. 
</p>
<p>This model upends the traditional financing approach, usually contingent on con-
</p>
<p>vincing accredited investors to make upfront financial commitments based on pre-
</p>
<p>dicted near-term returns. That approach entails a certain level of risk on the part of 
</p>
<p>investor and investee. Crowdfunding removes some of that risk for both parties.
</p>
<p>There are several types of crowdfunding: donation-based, loan-based, and 
</p>
<p>equity-based. Donation-based crowdfunding enables supporters of an idea to donate 
</p>
<p>money and in return to receive a non-monetary gift, such as the product initially 
</p>
<p>funded, public acknowledgement, or the sense of being part of a community. Loan- 
</p>
<p>based funding is neither a donation nor an investment; it is a loan to an entrepreneur 
</p>
<p>that is returned without interest. Conversely, equity-based funders give money with 
</p>
<p>the expectation of receiving a monetary return (this kind of crowdfunding is cur-
</p>
<p>rently under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US 
</p>
<p>and the rules governing such investments are expected to be announced in 2014).
</p>
<p>Crowdfunding enables alternative ideas that might not otherwise attract main-
</p>
<p>stream investor attention to gain traction. They often have a community

</p>
<p>development angle or social impact element. And, like the co-operative model, the 
</p>
<p>traditional power structures are upended.
</p>
<p>This model differs slightly from innovative product financing (see below) in that 
</p>
<p>it is focused on funding an idea or enterprise for the founder/entrepreneur/organiza-
</p>
<p>tion, rather than financing a product for a customer.
</p>
<p>There are now hundreds of crowdfunding platforms for everything from disaster 
</p>
<p>relief to creative projects and green community projects.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Community Sourced Capital: This online marketplace provides a 
</p>
<p>platform for small businesses to source capital from those in their community. 
</p>
<p>Businesses create campaigns that run on the CSC site, and the CSC team  manages 
</p>
<p>the platform and conducts due diligence on participating businesses. Community 
</p>
<p>members fund part of a larger loan by buying a Square, a $50 unit of the larger 
</p>
<p>loan made to the business. The Square is a simple loan that is meant to be repaid 
</p>
<p>in full, without interest.
</p>
<p> &ndash; CSC charges businesses that use their platform a $250 fee before launching a 
</p>
<p>campaign and a $100 monthly fee until the loan is repaid. To date, the company 
</p>
<p>has funded business improvements and innovations for 12 companies in 
</p>
<p>Washington state.22
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Fundly, for individuals to raise money for medical procedures, schooling or 
</p>
<p>charity
</p>
<p>&bull; GiveForward, focused on medical fundraising
</p>
<p>&bull; IndieGoGo, an international platform focused on funding the arts
</p>
<p>&bull; Kickstarter, the world&rsquo;s largest crowdfunding platform, focused on creative 
</p>
<p>projects
</p>
<p>&bull; Mosaic, a solar project funding platform
</p>
<p>Differential Pricing Some customers are not willing&mdash;or able&mdash;to pay as much as 
</p>
<p>others for the same product. Take seniors, for example who are often on fixed 
</p>
<p>incomes, and are offered reduced rates at restaurants, movie theaters or museums.
</p>
<p>Realizing that customers might need the same product but have different pay-
</p>
<p>ment thresholds, companies sometimes subsidize those who can&rsquo;t afford to pay as 
</p>
<p>much by charging others higher prices. The airline industry has used this model for 
</p>
<p>years by selling business class and economy tickets to fill a plane.
</p>
<p>The model has most recently been put to use, in developing world contexts, 
</p>
<p>where many consumers need essential services (e.g., health, education) but cannot 
</p>
<p>afford the market price. Institutions that offer different prices enable access to a 
</p>
<p>greater number of consumers from a range of economic levels.

</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospitals: This Indian hospital chain, 
</p>
<p>dubbed &ldquo;Walmart meets Mother Theresa&rdquo; by Fast Company,23 uses a pricing 
</p>
<p>model that is focused on reaching the poor, by treating the rich. Usually private 
</p>
<p>hospitals in India build their model the other way around: they focus on the rich 
</p>
<p>who can afford treatment. This hospital system was designed to service the poor 
</p>
<p>from the start. These patients pay discounted prices for services like surgery and 
</p>
<p>are subsidized by those who can afford to pay full price.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Narayana Hrudayalaya set up shop in Bangalore more than a decade ago, and 
</p>
<p>now manages or owns hospitals in 14 other Indian cities. Its doctors service local 
</p>
<p>patients as well as those farther afield, using Skype connections, allowing the 
</p>
<p>service to reach 100 additional facilities in India as well as more than 50&nbsp; in 
</p>
<p>Africa.
</p>
<p> &ndash; The company also exploits every possible efficiency, negotiating for better prices 
</p>
<p>from suppliers and cutting out middlemen.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Aravind Eye Care Hospital, in India, provides free or subsidized care to 
</p>
<p>two-thirds of its patients
</p>
<p>&bull; Novo Nordisk sells insulin at or below 20% of the average prices for insulin 
</p>
<p>in the Western world in the developing countries it operates within
</p>
<p>Freemium In this business model a proprietary product or service (often software, 
</p>
<p>media or web services) is provided free of charge, but money (premium) is charged 
</p>
<p>for &ldquo;premium&rdquo; features, functionality or virtual goods.24 A freemium model is some-
</p>
<p>times used to build a consumer base when a critical mass is needed to make the 
</p>
<p>product valuable to consumers.
</p>
<p>Social networks, like Twitter, FaceBook and LinkedIn all use this model to build 
</p>
<p>a user base, and only in later stages do they offer paid services or advertising 
</p>
<p>opportunities.
</p>
<p>Offering the product or service for free creates engagement with the brand. Often 
</p>
<p>early adopters of the product or service inadvertently provide a free marketing func-
</p>
<p>tion for the company, as users spread the word within their networks and encourage 
</p>
<p>others to participate.
</p>
<p>Although this model, when evaluated independently, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily offer 
</p>
<p>greater impact, it has been utilized to extend product lifecycles, as seen in the exam-
</p>
<p>ple below, which is why it has been included in this list.

</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: FreedomPop: This company began as a free wireless Internet pro-
</p>
<p>vider and has recently expanded into the mobile telecom service space.
</p>
<p> &ndash; FreedomPop&rsquo;s phone service removes the traditional contractual arrangement 
</p>
<p>with a mobile telephone service provider and enables customers to purchase a 
</p>
<p>discounted phone or use an existing phone&mdash;without a contract&mdash;and make a 
</p>
<p>limited number of calls and text messages for free using voice-over IP (VOIP) 
</p>
<p>service. Customers have the option of adding data and additional minutes for low 
</p>
<p>monthly fees.
</p>
<p> &ndash; FreedomPop&rsquo;s model is unique in that it only sells refurbished smartphones, sev-
</p>
<p>eral generations old. Customers get a &ldquo;new&rdquo; phone for much less money than 
</p>
<p>they would pay for a phone attached to a contract. The company also has a part-
</p>
<p>nership with Sprint that enables customers whose Sprint contracts have expired 
</p>
<p>to activate their phones without monthly fees using FreedomPop&rsquo;s US 
</p>
<p>network.25
</p>
<p> &ndash; The company extends the product lifecycle of mobile phones&mdash;providing an 
</p>
<p>interesting use case for older phones&mdash;and presents a disruptive model for the 
</p>
<p>traditional cellular phone lock-in contract model.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; SolarCity designs, installs, finances, and maintains solar systems; last year 
</p>
<p>they started offering Energy Explorer software to customers for free so that 
</p>
<p>they can pinpoint home inefficiencies and understand possible cost and sav-
</p>
<p>ings improvements.
</p>
<p>&bull; TextNow sells refurbished smart phones and offers commitment-free phone 
</p>
<p>plans to help cost-conscious customers save money.
</p>
<p>Innovative Product Financing Consumers lease or rent an item that they can&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>afford or don&rsquo;t want to buy outright. Often, the lease agreement can lead to owner-
</p>
<p>ship, which is sometimes called &ldquo;progressive purchase.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>While this model is not new, it is being used in innovative ways for environmen-
</p>
<p>tally friendly products&mdash;it is particularly popular in the renewable energy indus-
</p>
<p>try&mdash;and for positive social impacts.
</p>
<p>The model has similarities to product as a service, but is distinguished by a focus 
</p>
<p>on innovation within the financing component.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Simpa Networks: Simpa sells distributed energy solutions on a &ldquo;pro-
</p>
<p>gressive purchase&rdquo; basis to underserved consumers in emerging markets.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Currently operational in India, Simpa&rsquo;s goal is to transform the market for solar 
</p>
<p>energy systems. Customers make a small initial down payment for a high-quality 
</p>
<p>solar photovoltaic (PV) system and then pre-pay for the energy service, activat-
</p>
<p>ing their systems in small user-defined increments using a mobile phone. Each

</p>
<p>payment for energy also contributes towards the final purchase price. Once fully 
</p>
<p>paid, the system unlocks permanently and produces energy, free and clear.26
</p>
<p> &ndash; Before Simpa came along, many of its customers had limited access to electricity 
</p>
<p>and used kerosene lanterns&mdash;often dangerous to health, home and environ-
</p>
<p>ment&mdash;to illuminate their space. Solar energy systems offer health, educational 
</p>
<p>and income-generating benefits, but the traditional pricing model&mdash;$200&ndash;400 
</p>
<p>per individual solar system&mdash;is not affordable for most low-income consumers. 
</p>
<p>Simpa enables its customers to pay for a solar system over time. Because the 
</p>
<p>Simpa system lasts 10&nbsp;years, customers actually save money in the long run; 
</p>
<p>Simpa has calculated that during that same period a customer might have spent 
</p>
<p>$1500&ndash;2000 on kerosene, candles, batteries or phone-charging.27
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; SunEdison offers a progressive purchase agreement (PPA) to business and 
</p>
<p>retail customers; there is no upfront cost to have a solar system installed; users 
</p>
<p>pay for the electricity produced and used; SunEdison installs and maintains 
</p>
<p>the equipment.
</p>
<p>&bull; Sungevity offers customers the option of leasing or buying a solar system; the 
</p>
<p>company custom designs each system using an online system and satellite 
</p>
<p>imaging technology.
</p>
<p>Pay for Success This model employs performance-based contracting, typically 
</p>
<p>between providers of a social service and the government, to fund anticipatory ini-
</p>
<p>tiatives to prevent adverse outcomes. Often, private investment funds can be utilized 
</p>
<p>to cover upfront program costs.
</p>
<p>Typically, the government ends up paying for negative outcomes&mdash;they fund 
</p>
<p>jails because crimes have occurred or ambulances to respond to health emergencies. 
</p>
<p>Here, a government agrees to take part in a more anticipatory or preventative pro-
</p>
<p>gram to fund an evidence-based social intervention, and only pays a service pro-
</p>
<p>vider if the agreed-on target outcomes are achieved, e.g., health improvement or 
</p>
<p>reduced recidivism in prison inmates.
</p>
<p>The intent is to save the government money and improve communities by pre-
</p>
<p>venting negative outcomes. This model opens the door for financing from private 
</p>
<p>investors, encourages more efficacious use of government funds, and incentivizes 
</p>
<p>better performance by product/service providers.
</p>
<p>This novel exchange of funds comes with a guarantee of achieved outcomes.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Johnson &amp; Johnson: The medical devices, pharmaceutical and con-
</p>
<p>sumer packaged goods manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) has experimented 
</p>
<p>with its business model for Velcade, a drug targeting multiple myeloma, a form

<p> &ndash; J&amp;J offered the drug to European health ministries with a novel proviso&mdash;if the 
</p>
<p>drug is not efficacious in 90% of patients, the ministries need not pay for it.28
</p>
<p> &ndash; J&amp;J&rsquo;s experiment comes as the &ldquo;blockbuster&rdquo; drug model proves less and less 
</p>
<p>sustainable. Drug companies often charge patients extremely high prices to 
</p>
<p>recoup years of R&amp;D expenditures. But, patients and insurance companies can 
</p>
<p>find themselves in difficult financial straits when expensive drugs don&rsquo;t work. 
</p>
<p>This model places the onus of drug performance and cost on the drug company.

<p>Building a Marketplace Companies using this model to build new markets for 
</p>
<p>their products in innovative and socially responsible ways, including delivery of 
</p>
<p>social programs, partnerships, adapting to local markets, and bundling with other 
</p>
<p>services like microfinance and technical assistance. Here, the novel exchange mani-
</p>
<p>fests in the creation of a new market where there was none before.
</p>
<p>Building a marketplace involves much more than merely creating and marketing 
</p>
<p>a new product. In this model, consumers usually need to be educated about the 
</p>
<p>product or service and how or why it might be of value.
</p>
<p>Beyond consumer education, the company building the marketplace might also 
</p>
<p>have to arrange for financing to enable a consumer to make the purchase, and edu-
</p>
<p>cate and empower other stakeholders in the system, like distributors, community- 
</p>
<p>based organizations or local banks. In some instances, companies create entirely 
</p>
<p>new sales structures to facilitate the distribution of their product.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Novartis&rsquo; Arogya Parivar: This multinational pharmaceutical com-
</p>
<p>pany, known for drugs like Ritalin and over-the counter medicines like Theraflu, 
</p>
<p>Excedrin and Maalox, has combined education and sales efforts to create a for- 
</p>
<p>profit initiative to improve health outcomes for poor, rural communities in India. 
</p>
<p>Previously, many people in these communities have not had access to healthcare

</p>
<p>or have not been able to afford it. Novartis has tried to alleviate that challenge 
</p>
<p>through the Arogya Parivar model.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Using a &ldquo;1 plus 1 education&rdquo; model, Arogya Parivar employs Health Educators 
</p>
<p>who are trained in general health principles to educate a group of villages on a 
</p>
<p>number of health topics, with the goal of creating faith in medicine. An accom-
</p>
<p>panying supervisor educates doctors, service providers and pharmacies, and 
</p>
<p>assesses an area&rsquo;s needs. Where necessary, Novartis seeks local partners to build 
</p>
<p>up capacity to meet those needs.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Novartis has also had to consider its pricing structures. For this initiative, the 
</p>
<p>company has made its medications available in small packs at affordable prices, 
</p>
<p>in most cases not exceeding $1.25 a week.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Novartis reports that the program broke even within 30&nbsp;months, and they now 
</p>
<p>have ambitious plans for expansion to other countries. By investing in an entirely 
</p>
<p>new business ecosystem, Novartis has earned trust (and revenue) from a new 
</p>
<p>group of consumers&nbsp;&ndash; 42 million and counting.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; CEMEX&rsquo;s Patrimonio Hoy initiative uses a combination of microfinance, 
</p>
<p>distribution innovation and sales training to reach 265 million families with 
</p>
<p>home construction materials.29
</p>
<p>&bull; MicroEnsure provides micro-insurance to poor people in developing coun-
</p>
<p>tries, often through partnerships with mobile phone providers, whose access 
</p>
<p>to communities helps achieve scale across communities.
</p>
<p>Microfinance Microfinance is the provision of small loans&mdash;and in some cases 
</p>
<p>access to financial services more broadly&mdash;to low-income borrowers who do not 
</p>
<p>have access to a traditional bank account.
</p>
<p>Banks are less inclined to give low-income customers loans because of the high 
</p>
<p>associated costs with managing a small loan and the lack of collateral and credit 
</p>
<p>history. Independent community moneylenders have served as a bank alternative in 
</p>
<p>the past, but they charge borrowers exorbitant interest rates.
</p>
<p>The model has spread widely in developing countries in the last decade as a way 
</p>
<p>to advance financial inclusion and financial literacy.
</p>
<p>Microfinance is often provided via a group lending system of 8&ndash;15 community 
</p>
<p>members who vouch for one another to receive a loan. Dependent on social capital 
</p>
<p>and networks within the group, borrowers are incentivized to repay their loans with 
</p>
<p>interest to stay in the good graces of their neighbors.
</p>
<p>Many believe that when microfinance loans are given to entrepreneurs and small 
</p>
<p>businesses, it can alleviate poverty and drive greater prosperity for families and 
</p>
<p>communities.
</p>
<p>The microfinance concept has expanded to support the provision of housing 
</p>
<p>loans, water and sanitation loans, and insurance.

</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Water.org/WaterCredit: Water.org, a non-profit co-founded by Matt 
</p>
<p>Damon and Gary White, provides access to safe water and sanitation in develop-
</p>
<p>ing countries. The organization operates a unique program called WaterCredit 
</p>
<p>that uses microfinance loans to provide clean water and toilets to individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Low-income individuals who live in informal communities and slums often have 
</p>
<p>to pay premiums to access clean water because they are not connected to the 
</p>
<p>municipal water system. WaterCredit starts from the premise that there are many 
</p>
<p>people who can, and want to, finance safe water and sanitation if they are able to 
</p>
<p>pay for these services over time, as well as have a voice in their development and 
</p>
<p>operation.30
</p>
<p> &ndash; To date, WaterCredit has provided $34 million in loans, with the average loan 
</p>
<p>size $179. The program has had a 99% repayment since 2007.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Equitas is a Chennai, India-based microfinance institution that extends 
</p>
<p>microcredit to people who are otherwise unable to access finance from main-
</p>
<p>stream banking channels.
</p>
<p>&bull; Jamii Bora is a fast-growing microfinance bank in Kenya.
</p>
<p>Micro-Franchise This model leverages the basic concepts of traditional franchis-
</p>
<p>ing, but is specifically focused on creating opportunities for the poor to own and 
</p>
<p>manage their own businesses.
</p>
<p>This model has become popular in developing economies where it is often risky 
</p>
<p>to start a small business. Sometimes called a &ldquo;business in a box,&rdquo; the micro- franchise 
</p>
<p>model entails less risk for the would-be entrepreneur because it utilized a tried and 
</p>
<p>tested model.
</p>
<p>Several multi-national companies, including Unilever and SCJ, have piloted this 
</p>
<p>model to reach new customers in hard-to-reach areas or to access a new, lower- 
</p>
<p>income customer base.
</p>
<p>The advantages of using the micro-franchise model for a large company include 
</p>
<p>the utilization of a workforce with extensive local knowledge and networks, the 
</p>
<p>financial empowerment of community members who can later become customers, 
</p>
<p>and the establishment of local brand ambassadors.
</p>
<p>Here, as in the inclusive sourcing model, the exchange between company and 
</p>
<p>employee becomes much more dynamic than merely a payment for services. With a 
</p>
<p>micro-franchise model, the knock-on benefits are felt within the company&rsquo;s value 
</p>
<p>chain as well as within the communities the company operates within.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Fan Milk Limited: Fan Milk is a West African dairy business, started 
</p>
<p>by a Danish entrepreneur in the 1960s. The company uses a network of vendors 
</p>
<p>to distribute its products to more than 200 million people across seven countries 
</p>
<p>in West Africa.

</p>
<p> &ndash; Fan Milk offers micro-franchise opportunities to people in&nbsp;local communities to 
</p>
<p>become bicycle vendors. The startup cost is the equivalent of about US$22 for a 
</p>
<p>Fan Milk bike, which is equipped with a cooler, and vendors must buy the prod-
</p>
<p>ucts they will sell each day up front. Fan Milk offers vendors free bike repair, 
</p>
<p>training on product handling and hygiene, and prizes for being high-sellers. It 
</p>
<p>also requires its vendors to save a portion of their earnings each day.31
</p>
<p> &ndash; Last year, Fan Milk sold $166 million of dairy products. In October 2013, 
</p>
<p>Danone and a Dubai-based private equity firm announced their intentions to 
</p>
<p>acquire it.32
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Grameenphone&rsquo;s Village Phone Program enables a woman to acquire a 
</p>
<p>phone and then run a business that offers community members (in rural areas 
</p>
<p>of Bangladesh) access to that phone.
</p>
<p>&bull; Hapinoy, a Philippine network of small consumer goods stores, uses a con-
</p>
<p>version micro-franchise model which transfers existing businesses into mem-
</p>
<p>bers of a standardized network.
</p>
<p>&bull; SC Johnson&rsquo;s Community Cleaning Services, a Nairobi-based program, 
</p>
<p>creates income generating opportunities and drives sanitation improvements 
</p>
<p>by delivering more hygienic toilets at an affordable cost for low-income 
</p>
<p>clients.33
</p>
<p>&bull; Unilever&rsquo;s Project Shakti is a rural distribution initiative providing employ-
</p>
<p>ment to over 45,000 women in India.
</p>
<p>Subscription Model In this model, a customer must pay an ongoing fee, usually 
</p>
<p>monthly or annually, to gain ongoing access to a product or service. The customer 
</p>
<p>pays a fee, irrespective of product or service use and the company receives recurring 
</p>
<p>revenue and develops longer-term relationships with customers.
</p>
<p>In some instances, the model is tied to the purchase and operation of an asset, 
</p>
<p>where the consumer must pay an ongoing fee to make the asset operational. For 
</p>
<p>example, a user buys a phone then pays for the minutes to make it run. This model 
</p>
<p>yokes the purchase of the product, often at a discount, to a monthly or yearly con-
</p>
<p>tract, to make the product work. The contract guarantees financing for the company 
</p>
<p>in the future, so that it can make necessary investments in infrastructure.

</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Better Place: This now defunct electric mobility company attempted 
</p>
<p>to revolutionize transportation and disrupt the global energy system by making 
</p>
<p>car transport independent from oil. Better Place pioneered battery-switching 
</p>
<p>technology and aimed to sell cars at a discount, then to have customers buy sub-
</p>
<p>scriptions for miles.34
</p>
<p> &ndash; The company&rsquo;s success would have required a complete retooling of national 
</p>
<p>driving infrastructure, and although the company failed, the business model 
</p>
<p>innovation might work for other industries or help others innovate.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Blissmobox is a membership club that provides customers with a curated box 
</p>
<p>of organic, non-toxic and eco products each month.

<p> Diverse Impact
</p>
<p>Alternative Marketplaces An alternative marketplace occurs when a firm cir-
</p>
<p>cumvents a traditional method of transaction or invents a new type of transaction, to 
</p>
<p>unleash untapped value. Alternative marketplaces can reveal unused resources, dis-
</p>
<p>intermediate hierarchical systems, and in unique cases, create new channels for 
</p>
<p>exchange. The model often, but not always, manifests through technology network 
</p>
<p>innovations, like using the Internet to make a marketplace more transparent or using 
</p>
<p>cellular phones to transform airtime into money.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, alternative marketplaces provide a platform for exchange that 
</p>
<p>matches unused supply and unmet demand.
</p>
<p>While alternative marketplaces are not inherently more sustainable than other 
</p>
<p>marketplaces, entrepreneurs are increasingly using this business model type to 
</p>
<p>increase social and environmental impacts.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: ITC e-Choupal: This rural agribusiness arm of the Indian conglom-
</p>
<p>erate ITC provides Internet access and market pricing information that can boost 
</p>
<p>farmers&rsquo; earnings and eliminate middlemen through a technology terminal called 
</p>
<p>an e-Choupal. For over more than a decade, ITC has placed 6500 e-Choupals in 
</p>
<p>40,000 villages servicing more than 4 million families.
</p>
<p>e-Choupal works by breaking down the information asymmetry that has long hin-
</p>
<p>dered rural farmers. These farmers previously had little negotiating power when they 
</p>
<p>sold their goods because their only option was the government-mandated market-
</p>
<p>place&mdash;the mandi.35 ITC&rsquo;s e-Choupal has enabled access to market pricing informa-
</p>
<p>tion for farmers, giving them the choice of when to sell their crops and for how much.

</p>
<p>e-Choupal began as an agricultural commodity sourcing business, but has 
</p>
<p>evolved into a gateway for rural communities to connect to goods and services pro-
</p>
<p>viders. The model has strengthened ITC&rsquo;s agribusiness supply chain and its rela-
</p>
<p>tionships with farmer communities&mdash;e-Choupal brings in 40% of the revenues in 
</p>
<p>the Agribusiness division&mdash;and increased growth for the packaged foods side of the 
</p>
<p>business, while offering farmers choices and reforming the mandi system.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; ezetop enables people living abroad to send mobile phone top-up instantly to 
</p>
<p>family and friends in over 100 countries.
</p>
<p>&bull; OneMorePallet helps small businesses find available space in freight trucks.
</p>
<p>&bull; RelayRides enables car owners to rent out their idle vehicles to strangers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Safaricom&rsquo;s M-Pesa enables low-income Africans who can&rsquo;t access bank 
</p>
<p>accounts to transfer money via their cellular phones.
</p>
<p>&bull; Tesla circumvents the traditional car dealer sales model and sells direct to 
</p>
<p>consumers.
</p>
<p>Behavior Change Convincing consumers to change their behavior is a significant 
</p>
<p>component of the sustainability agenda. Business models designed to stimulate 
</p>
<p>behavior change for sustainability are a relatively new concept, but demonstrate that 
</p>
<p>profitable models can coincide with decoupling from resource use. These models 
</p>
<p>aim to reduce consumption, change purchasing patterns or modify daily habits. 
</p>
<p>Most often, they empower consumers with knowledge about their consumption, 
</p>
<p>helping them track product or service use, often using game dynamics to create 
</p>
<p>competition between customers.
</p>
<p>In the model, the nature of the transaction between consumer and company 
</p>
<p>becomes nuanced: it is less about selling more goods or services and more about 
</p>
<p>building brand trust and engagement. Companies employing this model aim to 
</p>
<p>increase &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; with the customer, making him or her less likely to buy from 
</p>
<p>another good/service provider.
</p>
<p>The fundamental challenge for behavior change business models is to find a way 
</p>
<p>to drive revenue growth while continuing to encourage a decrease in consumption. 
</p>
<p>The apparel brand Patagonia has experimented with behavior change marketing in 
</p>
<p>recent years, by encouraging consumers to buy less and repair more. However, 
</p>
<p>because Patagonia is a private company, it&rsquo;s hard to know if the company&rsquo;s bet has 
</p>
<p>resulted in greater revenues or greater loyalty.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: OPower: This software company partners with utility providers 
</p>
<p>around the world to promote energy efficiency among energy users. OPower 
</p>
<p>helps utility companies capture and analyze large datasets to create business 
</p>
<p>value, and offers various platforms for consumer engagement to help them 
</p>
<p>understand their energy bills and encourage them to save energy, save money and 
</p>
<p>reduce carbon emissions.

<p>488
</p>
<p> &ndash; OPower&rsquo;s business model is directly tied to the amount of behavior change it 
</p>
<p>drives. By empowering consumers with knowledge about their energy consump-
</p>
<p>tion, and by leveraging proven behavior-changing techniques (e.g., social proof, 
</p>
<p>commitments, and fear of loss), the company is changing the way people think 
</p>
<p>about their energy use and driving further engagement between the consumer 
</p>
<p>and the utility.
</p>
<p> &ndash; The company is now serving more than 90 utilities&mdash;including 8 of the US&rsquo;s 10 
</p>
<p>largest utility companies, and reaches more than 22 million homes around the 
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; RecycleBank rewards people for taking &ldquo;green actions&rdquo; with discounts and 
</p>
<p>deals from local and national businesses.
</p>
<p>Product as a Service Frequently, when consumers buy a product, they assume the 
</p>
<p>responsibility for disposing of it. How many of us have old cell phones piled in a 
</p>
<p>kitchen drawer because we are not sure how to safely throw them away?
</p>
<p>In this model, consumers pay for the service a product provides without the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of repairing, replacing or disposing of it. The company takes owner-
</p>
<p>ship for the lifecycle of the product whereas that responsibility was previously 
</p>
<p>transferred to the consumer.
</p>
<p>This model shifts the burden of product repair and replacement to the company, 
</p>
<p>and offers customers top product performance at all times, creating more account-
</p>
<p>ability within the broader system for product disposal, and higher likelihood of 
</p>
<p>product repair, reuse and recycling.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Hilti: Operating across the United Kingdom, Hilti develops, manu-
</p>
<p>factures and markets products, such as power tools, for the construction and 
</p>
<p>manufacturing industry. Its primary customer is the professional contractor. 
</p>
<p>Seven years ago, the company decided to diversify its offer with the Fleet 
</p>
<p>Management tool program. Instead of selling tools, the program provides the 
</p>
<p>service of tool use, allowing contractors to replace tools at any time and an evalu-
</p>
<p>ation system to calculate tool use and age, insurance to cover theft, and anytime- 
</p>

</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; re:source offers monthly membership fee for waste collection services and 
</p>
<p>processing of waste into useful products such as organic fertilizers and energy.
</p>
<p>&bull; Rolls Royce, the aerospace, power systems and defense company, handles 
</p>
<p>service and maintenance of the products it manufactures; rather than charging 
</p>
<p>per transaction, the company uses a TotalCare model focused on achieving 
</p>
<p>outcomes for each customer; service provision comprises between 43 and 
</p>
<p>64% of annual revenue in each business unit.

<p>&bull; Xerox, for several years, has been making the transition to a services-based 
</p>
<p>company, away from being solely a hardware provider.

</p>
<p>Shared Resource The sharing economy has changed the way consumers think 
</p>
<p>about ownership and created a new level of engagement between perfect strangers 
</p>
<p>in cities around the world.
</p>
<p>Shared resource models enable customers to access a product, rather than own-
</p>
<p>ing it, and use it only as needed. Because the product is shared, the model enables 
</p>
<p>efficient, productive use of a resource that might otherwise sit idle.
</p>
<p>This model differs from product as a service in that product users depend on the 
</p>
<p>participation and good behavior of other users for the model to operate effectively.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Spotlight: Fon: Fon attempts to solve the challenge of Internet accessibility for 
</p>
<p>consumers while they are away from their home, office or other readymade 
</p>
<p>Internet networks. Fon allows home WiFi users to safely share a signal with oth-
</p>
<p>ers through a Fon Spot and in return use others&rsquo; networks while away from home. 
</p>
<p>All the Fon Spots together create a crowdsourced network where everyone who 
</p>
<p>contributes connects for free.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Other examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; AirBnB provides a platform for those with an empty room or apartment to 
</p>
<p>rent it out on a short-term basis.
</p>
<p>&bull; ParkatmyHouse enables those with an available parking space, garage or 
</p>
<p>driveway to rent it out to others in the community.
</p>
<p>&bull; RelayRides allows private car-owners to rent out their vehicles via an online 
</p>
<p>interface.
</p>
<p>&bull; Zipcar, bought by Avis last year, is a member-based car-sharing company.
</p>
<p>&bull; Zilok provides a platform for owners of things like cameras, cars, or drills to 
</p>
<p>rent them to others.
</p>
<p> Patterns: Industry, Geography, Size and&nbsp;Type of&nbsp;Innovation
</p>
<p>We catalogued over 100 examples of business innovations, but when we took a 
</p>
<p>closer look, several of them were actually product and process innovations. We 
</p>
<p>culled our list to 87 business model innovation examples and arrived at the follow-
</p>
<p>ing conclusions.
</p>
<p>Business model innovators tend not to be Global Fortune 500 companies.
</p>
<p>Over half of the companies that demonstrated business model innovation were 
</p>
<p>small- or medium-sized (less than 1000 employees) such as startup businesses like 
</p>
<p>ParkatMyHouse, based in the UK, and Simpa Networks, based in India. Only seven 
</p>
<p>of the 87 companies evaluated are members of the Global Fortune 500.
</p>
<p>Almost half of the companies that demonstrated business model innova-
</p>
<p>tion were small or medium sized.

</p>
<p>Within this small cohort from the Global Fortune 500, the business model inno-
</p>
<p>vations observed are all transformations of an established model, but are mostly 
</p>
<p>limited in scope to a small segment of the business. For example, in 2012, Starbucks 
</p>
<p>launched a pilot with The Climate Group and researchers at the City University of 
</p>
<p>Hong Kong to experiment with the rematerialization of coffee grounds and uneaten 
</p>
<p>baked goods into new products, like &ldquo;detergent ingredients and bio-plastics that can 
</p>
<p>be incorporated into other useful products.&rdquo;36 Although the partnership is a pilot, it 
</p>
<p>holds promise for a new business model transformation that would create value and 
</p>
<p>a new source of revenue in the future for Starbucks (Chart 22.1).
</p>
<p>Most business model innovations come from the ground up.
</p>
<p>More than three-quarters of the companies we reviewed demonstrated an entirely 
</p>
<p>new, more sustainable model from the start (or &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; as we&rsquo;ve called it), 
</p>
<p>rather than as a transformation of an established business model. It is clearly easier 
</p>
<p>to build a new model that takes social and environmental concerns into account 
</p>
<p>from the ground up, rather than trying to transform a pre-existing model already in 
</p>
<p>operation&mdash;to put it simply, few want to try juggling while riding a bike.
</p>
<p>Some large companies (those with more than 1000 employees) have explored 
</p>
<p>business model transformations in parts of their businesses with varying levels of 
</p>
<p>success. Until a few years ago, Panera Bread, the St. Louis-based restaurant chain,

</p>
<p>had a traditional food retail business model, similar to Starbucks, Chipotle or 
</p>
<p>Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts. Customers see a price on a menu and pay that amount to get the 
</p>
<p>item they want. But, in some select locations, including 48&nbsp;St. Louis area stores, 
</p>
<p>Panera has experimented with a pay-what-you-want concept for certain menu items. 
</p>
<p>A customer picks the item he/she wants and pays what it is worth to him/her. 
</p>
<p>Panera&rsquo;s CEO hoped that the model would benefit hungry customers who might not 
</p>
<p>be able to afford a sandwich, and that costs would be offset by more generous cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. The model depended on social capital and trust between consumers and the 
</p>
<p>brand in order to work.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Panera found that the model didn&rsquo;t have the desired effect of help-
</p>
<p>ing the hungry. Without the right marketing, the needy were not aware of the pro-
</p>
<p>gram, and employees stopped explaining it. Media outlets report that the company 
</p>
<p>may retool the idea before bringing it back to stores.37
</p>
<p>Panera demonstrates that not all business model transformations will work. That 
</p>
<p>said, those transformation attempts provide tremendous opportunity to learn about 
</p>
<p>consumers and test ideas. On that front, there appears to be a group of emerging 
</p>
<p>pioneers from which other companies can learn. Large companies that are building 
</p>
<p>base of the pyramid businesses into scalable endeavors may be ones to watch as 
</p>
<p>these experimental parts of their businesses grow to comprise more revenue. 
</p>
<p>Novartis&rsquo; Arogya Parivar, for example, started as a pilot operating only in South 
</p>
<p>India, but has now spread to 10 states and reaches over 40 million people. The pro-
</p>
<p>gram has recently expanded to Kenya and Vietnam with plans in place to open in 
</p>
<p>Indonesia.
</p>
<p>Likewise, Cemex, the global materials and construction company, has built a 
</p>
<p>successful new marketplace in Central America through its program Patrimonio 
</p>
<p>Hoy, which provides housing microcredit. The 15-year-old program has helped 
</p>
<p>more than 35,000 families finance the construction of new homes (Chart 22.2).38
</p>
<p>Business model innovation benefits from technology use.
</p>
<p>Business model innovation examples occur across industries, but within our 
</p>
<p>sample they were most prevalent in retail, food &amp; beverage, consumer durables, and 
</p>
<p>financial services, which together comprise just over a third of the companies we 
</p>
<p>reviewed. However, within those industries, the models in use are diverse, making 
</p>
<p>it difficult to find patterns unique to any industry. What we do see is the increasing 
</p>
<p>utilization of technology to bring innovation across industries. For example, the 
</p>
<p>retail apparel arena is now peppered with new online marketplaces, like Bonobos, 
</p>
<p>Threadless, MUD Jeans, or Patagonia&rsquo;s CommonThreads initiative with eBay. In 
</p>
<p>the materials industry, RecycleMatch creates a market for discarded yet recyclable 
</p>
<p>material from large companies by using an online platform to match latent supply 
</p>
<p>and demand. In the transportation/shipping industry, OneMorePallet uses its online

<p>platform to find empty spaces in freight trucks and auction the spaces to buyers. All 
</p>
<p>use technology&mdash;particularly the Internet&mdash;to match supply and demand.
</p>
<p>Of course, not all prevalent models are technology dependent. Plenty of innova-
</p>
<p>tion is happening in healthcare, largely due to experimentation with delivering 
</p>
<p>affordable services to low-income customers in developing countries. This is seen 
</p>
<p>in the differential pricing models used by Novo Nordisk and Narayana Hrudayalaya; 
</p>
<p>building a marketplace by Novartis&rsquo; Arogya Parivar; or innovative product financ-
</p>
<p>ing used by Vestergaard&rsquo;s Lifestraw.
</p>
<p>However, the ability to measure, track and connect instantly using technology is 
</p>
<p>likely to be a major disruptive innovation across multiple industries and, if present 
</p>
<p>trends continue, is likely to yield even greater innovation in years to come.

</p>
<p>In part, this project started because we had grown weary of hearing Zipcar and its 
</p>
<p>car-sharing competitors cited as the ultimate in business model innovation. The con-
</p>
<p>cept of the sharing economy in general excites us, but we felt that there had to be 
</p>
<p>more to business model innovation than sharing-based models. The results suggest 
</p>
<p>our instinct was correct, although sharing-based models did feature high on the list.
</p>
<p>In fact, the alternative marketplace model appeared most frequently, perhaps 
</p>
<p>because many of these models take advantage of relatively recent technologies like 
</p>
<p>mobile messaging, remote sensing, and online networks. We hope to see more of 
</p>
<p>these models emerge in the future, as they are extremely innovative, creating new 
</p>
<p>currencies, circumventing traditional transactions, and reaching new stakeholders.
</p>
<p>We also came across a surprising number of cooperatives, which, it turns out, 
</p>
<p>come in all shapes, sizes and geographies. Cooperatives truly change the incentive 
</p>
<p>system within a company, to make members&mdash;whether employees or customers&mdash;
</p>
<p>much more likely to feel invested in the company and its brands.
</p>
<p>As companies try to expand through rural emerging markets, micro-franchising 
</p>
<p>models have also come into fashion. Their turnkey approach to replicating a proven 
</p>
<p>business model makes them a good match for low-income entrepreneurs who need 
</p>
<p>good jobs, but may be averse to starting their own enterprise from scratch.
</p>
<p>Lastly, product as a service models showed up frequently in our review. The 
</p>
<p>transition from a product-sales model to a service-provision model may feel more 
</p>
<p>comfortable for some companies for whom business model innovation becomes a 
</p>
<p>matter of capturing and packaging their internal knowledge and experience to share 
</p>
<p>with others. These models may be a natural evolution for large, hardware-driven 
</p>
<p>companies where resource scarcity looms as a future challenge (Chart 22.4).
</p>
<p>Business model innovation can happen anywhere.

<p>22 Business Model Innovations for&nbsp;Sustainability</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand where business model innovation is finding a foot-
</p>
<p>hold. For this paper, we considered where the actual innovation takes place&mdash;in 
</p>
<p>established, developed markets like the Netherlands, Spain, US and UK or in fast- 
</p>
<p>changing developing markets like China, India or Kenya. In other words, even if a 
</p>
<p>company is based in Europe, if the innovation in question is deployed in Mozambique, 
</p>
<p>we consider it a developing world innovation.
</p>
<p>Admittedly, the division is nuanced; yet there are distinct differences between 
</p>
<p>the innovations prevalent in established economies versus those seen in less devel-
</p>
<p>oped economies, and we wanted to understand what role geography plays in busi-
</p>
<p>ness model innovation.
</p>
<p>We assumed that most of the business model innovations we came across would 
</p>
<p>originate in the developing world because of the high incidence of path-breaking 
</p>
<p>enterprises, the proliferation of creative new ventures spun out of established com-
</p>
<p>panies (e.g., Safaricom&rsquo;s M-Pesa, ITC&rsquo;s e-Choupal), technology penetration and the 
</p>
<p>freedom of multinationals to innovate for new customer segments in these markets. 
</p>
<p>However, the examples that emerged from our research were geographically diverse. 
</p>
<p>In fact, only about half (51%) of the business model innovation examples occurred 
</p>
<p>in the developed world.
</p>
<p>Only a handful of innovations are global (i.e., both developed and developing 
</p>
<p>world), leading us to believe that either it is difficult for companies to create new 
</p>
<p>business models that can succeed in both the developed and developing world, or 
</p>
<p>few have moved beyond testing and succeeding in one market to rolling out in the 
</p>
<p>other. For example, Walmart practices inclusive sourcing with small farmers in 
</p>
<p>China and the US.&nbsp;The company is innovating its business model globally, but the 
</p>
<p>processes and pricing models are no doubt very different.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that business model innovation for sustainability can happen anywhere. 
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not limited to wealthier countries or dependent on frontier marketplaces, but is 
</p>
<p>likely more successful when focused on a particular marketplace (Chart 22.5).
</p>
<p>Not all innovation is truly business model innovation.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, what appears to be business model innovation is in fact, process or 
</p>
<p>product innovation. In searching for business model innovation examples, we found 
</p>
<p>that roughly two-thirds of the examples did, in fact, include a novel form of exchange 
</p>
<p>somewhere along the value chain. The other cases demonstrated process or product 
</p>
<p>innovation&mdash;worthwhile innovations, without a doubt, but just not the ones we 
</p>
<p>explored for this report.
</p>
<p>Business model innovation can emerge from process or product changes.
</p>
<p>While the majority of business model innovation examples clearly involve the 
</p>
<p>creation of a new model, there are a handful of notable examples that evolved from 
</p>
<p>process or product innovation into business model innovation. For example, when 
</p>
<p>Only about half of the business model innovation examples (51%) occurred 
</p>
<p>in the developed world.

<p>SAB Miller, the global alcohol beverage maker entered Mozambique, the company 
</p>
<p>discovered a new local, raw material to make beer&mdash;cassava&mdash;a product 
</p>
<p>innovation.
</p>
<p>However, the company&rsquo;s website explains, as SAB Miller began sourcing the 
</p>
<p>cassava, it interacted with local subsistence farmers, paying them a wage that 
</p>
<p>boosted income, thus creating a novel form of exchange within the value chain. 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government supported the effort by eliminating the excise tax on 
</p>
<p>cassava beer.
</p>
<p>Because of the tax break and its local sourcing efforts, SAB Miller was able to 
</p>
<p>sell the beer for 70% less than other similar beers in the marketplace making the 
</p>
<p>beer an affordable alternative to informal/illicit alcohol, which causes a number of 
</p>
<p>deaths from poisoning each year..39 What began as product innovation transformed 
</p>
<p>into business model innovation.
</p>
<p>Models with the most potential.
</p>
<p>This report highlights many types of business model innovations for sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity, some of which are, no doubt, more catalytic than others. This comes from a 
</p>
<p>model&rsquo;s ability to impact the systems that a company is part of while also function-
</p>
<p>ing as a more commercially viable alternative to current models. As we reviewed 
</p>
<p>and researched each model, we developed viewpoints on which models hold the 
</p>
<p>most promise for catalyzing change while continuing to generate commercial value.
</p>
<p>Four that we believe have great potential for the future, and which large compa-
</p>
<p>nies can consider as they experiment with business model innovation are closed 
</p>
<p>loop production, product as a service, inclusive sourcing, and the alternative

<p>marketplace.

<p>Closed loop production models present tremendous opportunities for companies 
</p>
<p>to cut costs and meet ambitious sustainability waste goals, while significantly 
</p>
<p>impacting the system. These models reduce the quantum of resources extracted 
</p>
<p>from the system. Several Fortune 500 companies, like Alcoa, Maersk and Nike, are 
</p>
<p>experimenting with these concepts on a product level&mdash;a move that could lead to 
</p>
<p>further innovation at the process or business model levels.
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also seeing several multinational companies (e.g., IBM, Rolls Royce plc, 
</p>
<p>Xerox) experiment with product as a service models. This approach can reduce 
</p>
<p>resource use and challenge companies to focus on product performance rather than 
</p>
<p>product sales. Depending on what a company produces, transitioning to a more 
</p>
<p>services-based model can be a more natural and gradual shift than some other 
</p>
<p>models.
</p>
<p>For companies that source products from small producers, either at home or 
</p>
<p>abroad, inclusive sourcing begs a closer look. As detailed in our description earlier 
</p>
<p>in this paper, while inclusive sourcing can require more effort and upfront invest-
</p>
<p>ment, it can reap dividends in the future by stabilizing the supply chain, building 
</p>
<p>brand loyalty, and creating a new, economically empowered consumer base. It can 
</p>
<p>also have a dramatic social impact on the populations it serves.
</p>
<p>Lastly, we are intrigued and excited by the concept of the alternative market-
</p>
<p>place. Technology&mdash;Internet, mobile, big data&mdash;can be used by companies to create 
</p>
<p>new markets which can enhance brand value and generate trust. We have seen 
</p>
<p>BOX: Making Business Model Innovation Work
</p>
<p>Despite the formidable barriers to business model innovation within large 
</p>
<p>companies, the body of research and experience developed over the past 
</p>
<p>decade about &ldquo;where innovation works&rdquo; offers a number of useful insights for 
</p>
<p>companies looking to create new models.
</p>
<p> 1. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to question existing models. The first step in building 
</p>
<p>something new is having the courage to examine the current model--as 
</p>
<p>Stahler puts it, getting &ldquo;all the tacit and unspoken assumptions on the 
</p>
<p>table.&rdquo; Challenging the dominant logic may, in fact, be the most difficult 
</p>
<p>step, but it&rsquo;s the only way to move towards identifying new options.
</p>
<p> 2. Be willing to try something new. If companies are best at maintaining 
</p>
<p>what they already do, recognize that any true business model innovation 
</p>
<p>will require building new skills and applying different capabilities. 
</p>
<p>Innovators should be willing to let go of what made them successful in the 
</p>
<p>past. Some experts recommend taking a &ldquo;portfolio approach&rdquo;, maintaining 
</p>
<p>focus on what&rsquo;s worked before, but dedicating some percentage of 
</p>
<p>resources towards development of entirely new business models.

<p>Patagonia do this through its recycled clothing initiative on eBay. We have also seen 
</p>
<p>the model drive new sources of revenue, as ITC e-Choupal has done in India, and 
</p>
<p>create environmental efficiencies, as OneMorePallet has done.
</p>
<p> How Large Companies Are Finding New Models
</p>
<p>Transforming an existing business model is less common than innovating from 
</p>
<p>scratch. As stated above, we see far fewer examples of business model innovation at 
</p>
<p>companies with existing, profitable models. This is likely due to the complexity of 
</p>
<p>transforming a working business model and the vested interests in the current 
</p>
<p>model. Far more often, we observe start-ups that create business models that have 
</p>
<p>interwoven social and environmental elements. The underlying reason is simple&mdash;it 
</p>
<p> 3. Establish and protect an innovation culture. For business model innova-
</p>
<p>tion to succeed, some level of cultural support must be present within the 
</p>
<p>company, or at least within a team responsible for innovation. This 
</p>
<p>includes, but it not limited to, a mission and/or goals that promote the pur-
</p>
<p>suit of innovative business models; the right management structure allow-
</p>
<p>ing for discussion and connection around innovation; incentives for 
</p>
<p>identifying and cultivating breakthrough innovation; and an entrepreneur-
</p>
<p>ial mindset, with the ability to prototype, experiment, fail fast, and learn 
</p>
<p>(as with the &ldquo;lean startup&rdquo; model).
</p>
<p> 4. Stay connected to the market. Business models are ultimately about the 
</p>
<p>value delivered to customers. To innovate, companies must stay connected 
</p>
<p>to ever-changing customer needs and market realities. It can be particu-
</p>
<p>larly helpful to understand local communities and their real needs and 
</p>
<p>wants. Design consultancy IDEO, for example, has developed a strong 
</p>
<p>competency around such &ldquo;human-centered design.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> 5. Remain open. In this age of transparency and hyper-connectivity, innova-
</p>
<p>tors can benefit from the opportunity to build new capacities and generate 
</p>
<p>new ideas through alliances and sharing. Whether it&rsquo;s new public-private 
</p>
<p>partnerships or crowdsourced innovation, companies have realized the 
</p>
<p>benefit of extending their innovation network.
</p>
<p> 6. Take a structured approach. Corporate strategy is not a conceptual exer-
</p>
<p>cise, nor should it be done haphazardly. Likewise, any business model 
</p>
<p>innovation effort should follow a disciplined, structured approach. While a 
</p>
<p>variety of sound approaches have been developed by researchers and con-
</p>
<p>sultancies, the specific approach is less important than insuring that some 
</p>
<p>structure has been introduced.
</p>
<p> 7. Be prepared to struggle. It may not be the case--and if it isn&rsquo;t count your-
</p>
<p>self as lucky--but expect that the innovation process will take some time 
</p>
<p>and muddling. Build budgets and project timelines accordingly.

</p>
<p>is far easier to build a more sustainable structure brick by brick than retroactively 
</p>
<p>retooling a business&rsquo; underlying framework.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, companies have found creative ways to innovate and experiment with 
</p>
<p>new business models for sustainable outcomes by partnering with social entrepreneurs 
</p>
<p>and using diverse channels to search for and experiment with new business models.
</p>
<p>Social entrepreneurs have become a key cohort for sustainability practitioners to 
</p>
<p>watch because they are at the forefront of sustainability. The 2013 Global 
</p>
<p>Sustainability Survey produced by GlobeScan and SustainAbility found that sus-
</p>
<p>tainability experts view social entrepreneurs as leading the way on the sustainability 
</p>
<p>agenda, ahead of scientists, NGOs, large companies and national governments.
</p>
<p>Social entrepreneurial ventures have the advantage of being smaller and more 
</p>
<p>nimble than multinational companies, able to tweak their business models as mar-
</p>
<p>kets change and incorporate social or environmental benefits into their models from 
</p>
<p>the start. A recent Harvard Business Review blog, Meet Your new R&amp;D Team: Social 
</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs,40 identified social entrepreneurs as the &ldquo;new R&amp;D&rdquo; for large compa-
</p>
<p>nies, describing investments in social entrepreneurs as an important part of the inno-
</p>
<p>vation continuum. Indeed, companies seeking to enter emerging markets or source 
</p>
<p>more ethically have benefitted from the on-the-ground intelligence, market exper-
</p>
<p>tise and strong relationships with suppliers that social entrepreneurs often have.
</p>
<p>Another method of business model experimentation occurs via impact invest-
</p>
<p>ments by companies. These investments, often led or facilitated by the corporate 
</p>
<p>responsibility team, are one method of &ldquo;de-risking&rdquo; new market entry. As the above- 
</p>
<p>referenced HBR blog mentions, this &ldquo;reverses the traditional CSR model of giving 
</p>
<p>back to communities that a business operates in, and places these investments at the 
</p>
<p>front end of corporate innovation strategy.&rdquo; The writer, Robert Fabricant of Frog 
</p>
<p>Design, cites the investment by the Shell Foundation into social enterprise Husk 
</p>
<p>Power Systems, a renewable rural electrification enterprise in India.
</p>
<p>Companies have also created various means to find and invest in or pilot models 
</p>
<p>that have more sustainable outcomes. Several companies have launched innovation 
</p>
<p>platforms, such as P&amp;G&rsquo;s &ldquo;Corporate Platforms.&rdquo; Corporate Platforms is the new 
</p>
<p>business &ldquo;capability building organization&rdquo; within P&amp;G, with the responsibility and 
</p>
<p>resources to disrupt existing models. Through this unit, P&amp;G is exploring new tech-
</p>
<p>nologies and smarter products.
</p>
<p>One partnership, with a crowdfunding site called CircleUp, allows P&amp;G to spot 
</p>
<p>business model innovations and new consumer products early. Waste2Worth,

</p>
<p>another project emerging from Corporate Platforms, eliminates consumer waste to 
</p>
<p>landfill in developing regions by extracting maximum value from waste, thereby 
</p>
<p>stimulating economic development and sustainable infrastructure. At a Charmin 
</p>
<p>plant in Latin America, Waste2Worth converts paper waste fiber into roof tiles, and 
</p>
<p>waste from a site in China is being converted into fertilizer for planting trees.41 
</p>
<p>These measures are small efforts, but could be viable models for future revenue 
</p>
<p>streams and could help close the waste loop.
</p>
<p>In-house venture funds also advance companies toward &ldquo;the next big thing&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>
<p>which just might be more sustainable. For example, BMW&rsquo;s iVenture arm, based in 
</p>
<p>New&nbsp; York, incubates and invests in early- and mid-stage companies with high 
</p>
<p>potential in the area of mobility services. Investments have included ParkatMyHouse, 
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;AirBnB of parking,&rdquo; MyCityWay, an app for all aspects of urban navigation and 
</p>
<p>ChargePoint, an electric vehicle charging company.42 While BMW iVentures doesn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>claim to focus on sustainability, it is an ideal illustration of the happy collision of 
</p>
<p>business value and innovation for sustainability. As BMW prepares for a future that 
</p>
<p>may make car ownership unaffordable or inaccessible for many, the company is 
</p>
<p>working to uncover the most innovative tools for the transportation of tomorrow.
</p>
<p>Acquisitions also enable companies to co-opt more sustainable models. This 
</p>
<p>trend is most evident in the automotive industry, which has embraced the disruptive 
</p>
<p>waves caused by carsharing initiatives. Large corporations have acquired carsharing 
</p>
<p>start ups (Avis bought ZipCar in 2013), launched their own car sharing services 
</p>
<p>(Daimler, BMW and VW) and partnered to target new consumers (Toyota con-
</p>
<p>nected with a real estate developer in Tokyo to offer electric vehicle sharing in&nbsp;local 
</p>
<p>condominiums).43 We have also seen values-led food businesses get acquired by 
</p>
<p>large companies interested in reaching a different consumer segment, often in pur-
</p>
<p>suit of a healthier product portfolio or products with a more ethical brand; oft-cited 
</p>
<p>examples include Unilever&rsquo;s acquisition of Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s, Group Danone acquiring 
</p>
<p>Stonyfield Farm and Coca Cola buying a majority share of Honest Tea.
</p>
<p>One of the exciting developments coming from corporate sustainability innova-
</p>
<p>tion leaders is the launch of dedicated R&amp;D centers focused on innovation that can 
</p>
<p>yield sustainable outcomes. Nike&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sustainable Business &amp; Innovation Lab,&rdquo;44

<p>Levi&rsquo;s Eureka Innovation Lab,45and Philips&rsquo; R&amp;D unit46 have all produced more 
</p>
<p>sustainable products and processes that advance their understanding of sustainable 
</p>
<p>design and innovation thereby making it more likely they will be at the forefront of 
</p>
<p>business model innovation in the future.
</p>
<p> Final Remarks
</p>
<p>What are we to do with the 20 models identified in this paper? We hope that they 
</p>
<p>will inspire, for a start, and spur creativity as business and sustainability leaders 
</p>
<p>look across their own value chains for areas of opportunity and transformation.
</p>
<p>But, if we&rsquo;re honest, we have to acknowledge that most of the large companies 
</p>
<p>we work with are not changing their business models&mdash;many enjoy stable market 
</p>
<p>positions and healthy returns, so it may be challenging to find a reason to shift 
</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s working today.
</p>
<p>Many business model innovations occur not as a result of deliberate effort to be 
</p>
<p>more inventive, but rather as a byproduct of coming to terms with other trends and 
</p>
<p>threats that a company faces. For example, Adidas, Nike, Zara and other footwear 
</p>
<p>and apparel brands are only now looking deep into their multi-tiered supply chains 
</p>
<p>to eliminate toxic chemicals as a result of discoveries by Greenpeace that water-
</p>
<p>ways and communities were being polluted. Likewise, companies like Gap, 
</p>
<p>Walmart, Kohl&rsquo;s, Target and Macy&rsquo;s are rethinking how they engage and support 
</p>
<p>apparel factory owners&mdash;together they formed the Bangladesh Alliance for Worker 
</p>
<p>Safety which mentions providing owners loans to improve safety&mdash;to prevent 
</p>
<p>deadly accidents like the Rana Plaza factory collapse last year.
</p>
<p>How can companies get ahead of the curve before an issue becomes urgent? How 
</p>
<p>much destroyed value&mdash;lost resources, lost lives, lost sales, dilution of brand 
</p>
<p>value&mdash;are we willing to accept? Business model innovation is an on-ramp to get-
</p>
<p>ting ahead of the curve.
</p>
<p>When we started this report, we intended it to be a short primer covering a hand-
</p>
<p>ful of models that seemed to hold promise for future sustainability. We have done 
</p>
<p>much more than that. And yet, we haven&rsquo;t covered everything we would like to in 
</p>
<p>this first effort. The questions and the models continue to surface. As such, we plan 
</p>
<p>for this to be the start of a more in-depth exploration.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to dig deeper. If business model innovation is indeed a key ingredi-
</p>
<p>ent to transforming our economic landscape and improving social and environmen-
</p>
<p>tal outcomes, it is worth understanding what drives it, what the most promising

<p>business models are, and what might compel a company to transform an existing 
</p>
<p>model.
</p>
<p>We conclude the paper with more questions than answers:
</p>
<p> &ndash; What incentives would help companies with commercially successful, but inher-
</p>
<p>ently unsustainable business models transform?
</p>
<p> &ndash; How does the business model innovation process happen within a large com-
</p>
<p>pany? Who drives it? Who needs to be involved?
</p>
<p> &ndash; What does a more sustainable business model look like in each industry (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Fast fashion? Coal-powered utilities? Food &amp; beverage?)
</p>
<p> &ndash; How can we grow the business models that are inherently more sustainable but 
</p>
<p>not currently as commercially successful?
</p>
<p>We hope to explore these questions and others as our research into business 
</p>
<p>model innovation deepens.
</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next? From here we plan on holding roundtable discussions in several 
</p>
<p>markets to share the ideas within this paper and evolve our thinking. We will also 
</p>
<p>share some of the ideas and models within this paper in a blog series to be published

<p>23From Incrementalism to&nbsp;Transformation: Reflections on&nbsp;Corporate Sustainability 
from&nbsp;the&nbsp;UN Global Compact-Accenture 
CEO Study
</p>
<p>Peter&nbsp;Lacy,  Pranshu&nbsp;Gupta, and Rob&nbsp;Hayward
</p>
<p>Over the last decade, sustainability has become firmly established on the corporate 
</p>
<p>agenda. CEOs have become more confident in discussing sustainability issues 
</p>
<p>and their impact; sustainability reporting has become commonplace; and business 
</p>
<p>leaders talk of sustainability as a critical driver of future success. But beneath 
</p>
<p>the surface, progress in embedding sustainability into companies, industries and 
</p>
<p>markets may be slower than anticipated. Despite individual achievements, progress 
</p>
<p>has slowed, with many companies struggling to move beyond philanthropy and 
</p>
<p>corporate social responsibility. The new era of integrated sustainability, once 
</p>
<p>confidently predicted by CEOs, has perhaps never seemed so far away.1
</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the UN Global Compact has conducted a triennial survey 
</p>
<p>of CEO opinion on sustainability. Through a series of in-depth interviews and online 
</p>
<p>surveys, the three studies&nbsp;&ndash; published in 2007, 2010 and 2013&nbsp;&ndash; together offer a 
</p>
<p>unique perspective on corporate sustainability since the founding of the Global 
</p>
<p>Compact in 2000. In this article, we reflect on the insights of the CEO Study in order 
</p>
<p>to trace the development of sustainability, and shed light on the current pathway 
</p>
<p>towards a more sustainable economy.
</p>
<p>1 Definitions of &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; and &lsquo;sustainable business&rsquo; abound. As a working definition, and an 
</p>
<p>aspiration, we use the term &lsquo;sustainable business&rsquo; to mean a company or organization that creates 
</p>
<p>value for owners, stakeholders and society through its products and services, operations and value 
</p>
<p>chain, while delivering a &lsquo;net positive&rsquo; social, environmental and economic impact; embedded 
</p>
<p>within this concept is the idea of &lsquo;zero-harm&rsquo; to people and planet.</p>

</p>
<p> From Philanthropy to&nbsp;ESG: The&nbsp;First Wave
</p>
<p>The first CEO Study, commissioned by the UN Global Compact in 2007 and con-
</p>
<p>ducted by McKinsey &amp; Company,2 reflected a world in which sustainability issues 
</p>
<p>were just beginning to move from the domain of academic debates and NGOs to 
</p>
<p>become a primary concern of business. In the early 2000s, as companies had begun 
</p>
<p>to respond to the demands of NGOs, the media and their own employees, discus-
</p>
<p>sions of environmental and social impact became commonplace. Many companies 
</p>
<p>established corporate social responsibility teams, and sought to partner with chari-
</p>
<p>ties and NGOs on philanthropic initiatives: building wells in rural communities, for 
</p>
<p>example, or donating computer equipment to schools.
</p>
<p>By the time of this first study, Shaping the New Rules of Competition, a small 
</p>
<p>group of companies&nbsp;&ndash; themselves &lsquo;early adopters&rsquo;, through their membership of the 
</p>
<p>UN Global Compact&nbsp;&ndash; are seen to be considering the implications of these shifts for 
</p>
<p>their competitive positions; the &lsquo;new rules of competition&rsquo; would be based, they 
</p>
<p>believed, on a more active role in promoting social and economic prosperity that in 
</p>
<p>turn would build trust and legitimacy with the public. The study revealed that more 
</p>
<p>than nine in ten business leaders were doing more than 5&nbsp;years previously to incor-
</p>
<p>porate environmental, social and political issues into their firms&rsquo; core strategies, and 
</p>
<p>showed how business leaders were becoming ever more comfortable with the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of sustainability. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d talked to any CEO about what their carbon foot-
</p>
<p>print was one year ago,&rdquo; said one CEO quoted in the Study, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have been met 
</p>
<p>with a fairly blank stare. Now they&rsquo;d be able to give you a pretty good answer.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The authors highlighted new demands and expectations on business:
</p>
<p>Many executives see the new standards and demands as burdens. But our research shows 
</p>
<p>that some visionary CEOs are recognizing them as opportunities to apply their creativity 
</p>
<p>and resources to gain competitive advantage, and help address some of the world&rsquo;s biggest 
</p>
<p>challenges. As governments around the world wrestle to address issues that cross borders, 
</p>
<p>there is growing recognition that the marketplace and private enterprises that operate on a 
</p>
<p>global scale can and must help find solutions to global problems. Many experts believe, for 
</p>
<p>example, that given the right price signals, the market is better equipped to address climate 
</p>
<p>change than any central planning or state enterprise model. We are therefore witnessing the 
</p>
<p>dawn of a new era in corporate innovation and experimentation, when new partnerships 
</p>
<p>and standards will emerge, when new, more transparent measures will better reflect the full 
</p>
<p>costs of doing business, and when greater private participation in the delivery of public 
</p>
<p>goods and services will change companies&rsquo; roles in society.3
</p>
<p>This anticipated shift in the role of companies in society marks an important 
</p>
<p>development. After years of &lsquo;unrestrained capitalism&rsquo;, CEOs can be seen to be 
</p>
<p>reflecting on the legitimacy of business and the challenge of building public trust, as 
</p>
<p>well as the tensions between business-as-usual and the challenges of environmental 
</p>
<p>and resource constraints: in the words of one Latin American CEO, &ldquo;Society&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>expectations of our company, and business in general, have increased significantly

</p>
<p>in the last five years, particularly around environmental issues and broader social 
</p>
<p>and economic development.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Asked about the factors motivating them to take action on sustainability issues, 
</p>
<p>CEOs identify employees, consumers and governments as the most important stake-
</p>
<p>holder groups, reflecting a combination of incentives: attracting and retaining talent 
</p>
<p>through a commitment to social responsibility; securing consumer preference and 
</p>
<p>loyalty through &lsquo;green&rsquo; branding; and responding to government and regulatory 
</p>
<p>requirements. Through these various motivations, we can trace a strong current run-
</p>
<p>ning through the Study: sustainability, rooted in philanthropy and CSR, becoming 
</p>
<p>embedded more widely across business&nbsp;&ndash; with the early signs of a real commitment 
</p>
<p>to addressing social and environmental challenges.
</p>
<p> The Financial Crisis and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Rise of&nbsp;&lsquo;Sustainability&rsquo;
</p>
<p>The financial crisis of 2008&ndash;2010 fundamentally changed approaches to corporate 
</p>
<p>sustainability. Economic pressures and the demands of short-term survival forced 
</p>
<p>many companies to re-examine their CSR programmes and philanthropy initiatives, 
</p>
<p>seeking tangible, measurable returns on investment and integrating sustainability 
</p>
<p>more closely into the fundamentals of business. As the 2010 CEO Study, A New Era 
</p>
<p>of Sustainability, notes:
</p>
<p>In the course of our survey and conversations with CEOs, we have witnessed a fundamental 
</p>
<p>shift since the last Global Compact survey in 2007. Then, sustainability was just emerging 
</p>
<p>on the periphery of business issues, an increasing concern that was beginning to reshape 
</p>
<p>the rules of competition. Three years later, sustainability is truly top-of-mind for CEOs 
</p>
<p>around the world. While environmental, social and governance challenges continue to grow 
</p>
<p>and CEOs wrestle with competing strategic priorities, sustainable business practices and 
</p>
<p>products are opening up new markets and sources of demand; driving new business models 
</p>
<p>and sources of innovation; changing industry cost structures; and beginning to permeate 
</p>
<p>business from corporate strategy to all elements of operations.4
</p>
<p>Strikingly, in what quickly became the headline number of the 2010 Study, 93% of 
</p>
<p>CEOs reported that sustainability would be &lsquo;important&rsquo; or &lsquo;very important&rsquo; to the 
</p>
<p>future success of their business; sustainability, it appeared, had shifted from an 
</p>
<p>optional &lsquo;nice-to-have&rsquo; to an essential part of core business, with real, tangible 
</p>
<p>impacts on the fundamentals of success. Consumers, employees and governments 
</p>
<p>all grew in their perceived importance in setting the agenda for sustainability, as 
</p>
<p>NGOs fell away&nbsp;&ndash; a move away from issue-based, reactive responses, perhaps, and 
</p>
<p>towards sustainability as an integrated part of core business. With the crisis of trust 
</p>
<p>still a white-hot issue for business leaders, CEOs identified &lsquo;brand, trust and reputa-
</p>
<p>tion&rsquo; as the prime motivating factor to take action on sustainability, followed by the 
</p>
<p>potential for revenue growth and cost reduction&nbsp;&ndash; a further sign that sustainability 
</p>
<p>was no longer considered peripheral to business, but an integral part of relationships 
</p>
<p>with consumers and customers, and a strategy that could benefit the bottom line.

</p>
<p>Another notable development is the prominence of the term &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; itself. 
</p>
<p>Virtually absent from the 2007 study&nbsp;&ndash; the word appears only twice, in mentions of 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;environmental sustainability&rsquo; and &lsquo;sustainability reports&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash; &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; appears 
</p>
<p>no fewer than 360 times in the 2010 study, including in the title itself. Analysis of 
</p>
<p>transcripts from interviews with CEOs in 2010 reveals the rise of &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; as 
</p>
<p>a mainstream concept in business: from the ubiquity of &lsquo;ESG&rsquo; in 2007, &lsquo;sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity&rsquo; has taken over, featuring on multiple occasions in every conversation.
</p>
<p>The combination of business leaders&rsquo; focus on efficiency and survival, and the 
</p>
<p>maturation of &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; as a mainstream concept, had important consequences 
</p>
<p>for the development of companies&rsquo; approach to environmental, social and gover-
</p>
<p>nance issues. From the broad approach evident in 2007, as CEOs discussed rebuild-
</p>
<p>ing the social contract within an economy that demanded more from business, 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; for many companies became shorthand for a narrow focus on incre-
</p>
<p>mental achievements in environmental efficiency. From a commitment motivated by 
</p>
<p>a sense of responsibility and &lsquo;the right thing to do&rsquo;, sustainability became a busi-
</p>
<p>ness-led imperative, motivated by short-term concerns and justified by its impact on 
</p>
<p>the bottom line. Throughout the 2010 Study, we can see companies focussing on the 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;quick wins&rsquo; of energy and resource efficiency and cost reduction: in the words of 
</p>
<p>one senior business leader quoted in the Study, &ldquo;If managing a business sustainably 
</p>
<p>is about using resources efficiently, then it serves the cost agenda as well.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As the focus of sustainability narrowed, business leaders&rsquo; confidence soared. 
</p>
<p>From a nebulous concept, fraught with fundamental questions about the role of 
</p>
<p>business in a healthy society, sustainability now presented a narrowly-defined set of 
</p>
<p>expectations and demands. Companies built their capabilities in measuring and 
</p>
<p>reporting carbon emissions; in tracking health and safety in the workplace; in pro-
</p>
<p>moting diversity within the workforce. Many more companies made public commit-
</p>
<p>ments to environmental sustainability; published annual sustainability reports; and 
</p>
<p>reported year-on-year metrics under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Buoyed 
</p>
<p>by this progress, 81&nbsp;% of CEOs surveyed reported that sustainability issues were 
</p>
<p>fully embedded in the strategy and operations of their company&nbsp;&ndash; and more than half 
</p>
<p>anticipated a &lsquo;tipping point&rsquo; where sustainability would be integrated into compa-
</p>
<p>nies and global markets within a decade.
</p>
<p> &lsquo;Frustrated Ambition&rsquo;: Reaching the&nbsp;Plateau
</p>
<p>Fast forward to the most recent CEO Study in 2013,5 and the bullishness of business 
</p>
<p>leaders has all but disappeared. Far from continuing towards the &lsquo;new era&rsquo; they 
</p>
<p>anticipated in 2010, many CEOs feel that business has become complacent about 
</p>
<p>progress, describing a situation in which sustainability has become embedded into 
</p>
<p>communications and rhetoric, but not into the everyday realities of business. Two 
</p>
<p>headline numbers from the 2013 study give a striking indication of business leaders&rsquo;

</p>
<p>perspective: just one-third believe that the global economy is on track to meet the 
</p>
<p>needs of a growing population within environmental and resource constraints; and 
</p>
<p>one-third believe that business is doing enough to address sustainability challenges 
</p>
<p>(Figs.&nbsp;23.1 and 23.2).
</p>
<p>Reflecting on their own progress in embedding sustainability into core business, 
</p>
<p>CEOs express a sense of &lsquo;frustrated ambition&rsquo;. Business leaders remain convinced 
</p>
<p>that sustainability will transform their industries; that leadership can bring competi-
</p>
<p>tive advantage; and that sustainability can be a route to new waves of growth and 
</p>
<p>innovation. In the words of Ramakrishnan Mukundan of Tata Chemicals, &ldquo;There is 
</p>
<p>no choice for businesses but to get on the road to sustainability: it is unsustainable 
</p>
<p>to be unsustainable.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>But beneath this commitment, frustration is clearly evident: business leaders are 
</p>
<p>in many cases unable to locate and quantify the business value of sustainability; are 
</p>
<p>struggling to deliver the business case for action at scale; and see market failure 
</p>
<p>hindering business efforts to tackle global challenges. CEOs see business caught in 
</p>
<p>a cycle of &ldquo;pilot paralysis&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; individual, small-scale projects with an incremental 
</p>
<p>impact on sustainability metrics&nbsp;&ndash; and while they see a role for business in promot-
</p>
<p>ing sustainable development, their responsibilities to the more traditional funda-
</p>
<p>mentals of business success are preventing greater scale, speed and impact 
</p>
<p>(Figs.&nbsp;23.3 and 23.4).

</p>
<p> Consumers Are Conflicted in&nbsp;Their Signals: And&nbsp;May Not 
Provide the&nbsp;Answer
</p>
<p>In the most recent survey, it is clear that market-facing factors are influencing CEOs&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>approach to sustainability: the top three motivating factors to take action are brand, 
</p>
<p>trust and reputation (69%), the potential for revenue growth and cost reduction 
</p>
<p>(49%) and consumer demand (47%). These factors, ranked above such motivators 
</p>
<p>as employee engagement, personal motivation, or pressure from government and 
</p>
<p>regulators, demonstrate how business leaders have begun to root sustainability in 
</p>
<p>the business case.
</p>
<p>The consumer emerges as the most important stakeholder when it comes to hav-
</p>
<p>ing an impact on a company&rsquo;s approach to sustainability. Consumers are ranked 
</p>
<p>among the three most influential stakeholder groups by 64% of CEOs, continuing 
</p>
<p>the trend observed in 2010, when 58% of CEOs ranked them among the top three 
</p>
<p>influencers, up from 50% in 2007. For consumer-facing businesses, understanding 
</p>
<p>the shifting preferences and desires of disparate consumer groups is a constant and 
</p>
<p>complex undertaking. Business leaders strongly believe that their sustainability

industries, there is a

</p>
<p>performance and reputation are key factors in shaping consumer and customer 
</p>
<p>demand: CEOs report that both the reputation and brand of their company on sus-
</p>
<p>tainability (81%) and the sustainability performance of products and services (77%) 
</p>
<p>are important in the purchasing decisions of their consumers and customers. As one 
</p>
<p>CEO in the technology industry told us, &ldquo;Five years ago, sustainability was impor-
</p>
<p>tant, but not core to how we delivered value to customers; now we have products 
</p>
<p>designed with sustainability in mind.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Despite their belief in the importance of sustainability for consumers, CEOs are 
</p>
<p>realistic with regard to its impact in the market. CEOs remain skeptical of consumers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>willingness to make trade-offs between sustainability and traditional differentiators, 
</p>
<p>with 46% believing sustainability issues will always rank behind price, quality and 
</p>
<p>availability. In the words of Peder Holk Nielsen, president and CEO of the Danish 
</p>
<p>biotech company Novozymes, &ldquo;Sustainable solutions have to be qualitatively or 
</p>
<p>economically on par or better than the old processes that they replace; it has never 
</p>
<p>been possible to charge extra for sustainability.&rdquo; While 28% of CEOs report securing 
</p>
<p>a price premium through their approach to sustainability, many believe that this 
</p>
<p>may not be sustainable or that it may not reach beyond a small segment of &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>consumers. &ldquo;Consumers are aware of sustainability but are not willing to compromise 
</p>
<p>on quality, convenience or price,&rdquo; said Henkel CEO Kasper Rorsted.
</p>
<p>The recent companion study conducted by Accenture and Havas Media, on the 
</p>
<p>views and expectations of 30,000 consumers worldwide, show the challenge of engag-
</p>
<p>ing the consumer on sustainability. The study reveals that, although CEOs see engage-
</p>
<p>ment with consumers as the most important single factor motivating them to accelerate 
</p>
<p>progress on sustainability, less than one-quarter of consumers report that they regu-
</p>
<p>larly seek information on the sustainability performance of the brands whose products 
</p>
<p>they purchase, and less than one-third &lsquo;often&rsquo; or &lsquo;always&rsquo; consider sustainability in 
</p>
<p>their purchasing decisions. In essence, consumers expect superior performance on

</p>
<p>sustainability and demand a greater contribution by business to global challenges, but 
</p>
<p>that they have little appetite to pay higher prices or to actively pursue information on 
</p>
<p>the sustainability performance of companies. CEOs and consumers alike are clear, 
</p>
<p>though, that sustainability is becoming an expectation, and that the reputation on 
</p>
<p>social, environmental and ethical issues can make or break brands&nbsp;&ndash; and companies.
</p>
<p> Investors Are Showing Greater Interest: But&nbsp;Remain 
Ambivalent and&nbsp;Are Unlikely to&nbsp;Drive Change
</p>
<p>In 2010, CEOs identified the relationship with investors as critical to making progress 
</p>
<p>on sustainability: 86% of CEOs saw the accurate valuation of sustainability by 
</p>
<p>investors as critical to progress. If companies could clearly communicate the value 
</p>
<p>of sustainability, and investors could factor sustainability performance into company

</p>
<p>valuations, CEOs believed that this relationship could unlock new investment and 
</p>
<p>reward the leaders in the field.
</p>
<p>But the 2013 survey reveals little momentum in the impact of investors on corpo-
</p>
<p>rate efforts in sustainability: as in 2010, just 12% of respondents regard investor 
</p>
<p>pressure as among their chief motivators on sustainability, and only 23% (from 22% 
</p>
<p>in 2010 and 19% in 2007) see investors as an important stakeholder. As one CEO 
</p>
<p>told us, &ldquo;Investors sit and listen politely when we bring these issues up, but they 
</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t ask about it&nbsp;&ndash; we&rsquo;re not doing this to please shareholders.&rdquo; And in the 
</p>
<p>words of another, &ldquo;My job as CEO is to make the company bigger, better and more 
</p>
<p>sustainable; I don&rsquo;t spend much time convincing investors, because I think if I do 
</p>
<p>my job, the rest will follow.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>But despite their absence from the most important stakeholders cited by CEOs, 
</p>
<p>investors do have an impact: 52% of executives report that investor interest is an 
</p>
<p>incentive for them to invest in sustainability, and 69% expect investor interest to be 
</p>
<p>an increasingly important factor in building sustainability issues into core business. 
</p>
<p>As one senior business leader put it, &ldquo;We still find it challenging to convey to main-
</p>
<p>stream investors why and how sustainability can drive value creation, but they&rsquo;re 
</p>
<p>starting to appreciate the risks of working in an unsustainable system.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Yet as with CEOs&rsquo; perceptions of the consumer, this belief in the growing inter-
</p>
<p>est of investors is yet to be reflected in the realities of the market. Just one-third of 
</p>
<p>CEOs of public companies believe that their share price currently includes value 
</p>
<p>directly attributable to sustainability initiatives and performance&nbsp;&ndash; further evidence 
</p>
<p>for CEOs&rsquo; own recognition that the lack of a link to business value is a barrier to 
</p>
<p>progress on sustainability. And the recent Accenture-PRI study of investor attitudes 
</p>
<p>to sustainability exposes a gap in communication: 57% of CEOs surveyed in the 
</p>
<p>UNGC-Accenture CEO Study reported they are able to set out their strategy for 
</p>
<p>seizing opportunities presented by sustainability; when asked the same question of 
</p>
<p>the companies in which they invest, just 9% of investors believe this to be the case. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, while 38% of CEOs believe they are able to accurately quantify the busi-
</p>
<p>ness value of their sustainability initiatives, just 7% of investors agree&nbsp;&ndash; a striking 
</p>
<p>gap which exposes the shortcomings of many companies in effectively communi-
</p>
<p>cating their approach to sustainability and its links to the traditional measures of 
</p>
<p>business value and success.
</p>
<p>Given these prolonged challenges in extending sustainability beyond the firm, 
</p>
<p>CEOs believe that business is not leading on sustainability in the way that was pre-
</p>
<p>dicted 3&nbsp;years ago. But our data suggests a disconnect between CEOs&rsquo; perceptions 
</p>
<p>of global progress and their opinion of their efforts and achievements: fully 76% of 
</p>
<p>CEOs are satisfied with the speed and effectiveness of execution on their own com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s sustainability strategy, and nearly two-thirds believe that they are doing 
</p>
<p>enough to address sustainability challenges. CEOs clearly recognize the scale of the 
</p>
<p>global challenge&nbsp;&ndash; but may not yet see the urgency or the incentive for their own 
</p>
<p>businesses to do more and to have a greater impact. This disconnect suggests that a 
</p>
<p>gap persists between the approach to sustainability of the majority of companies 
</p>
<p>globally&nbsp;&ndash; an approach still centered on philanthropy, compliance, mitigation and 
</p>
<p>incremental improvement&nbsp;&ndash; and the approach being adopted by leading companies, 
</p>
<p>focused on innovation, growth and new sources of value.

</p>
<p> The Transformational Leaders: Steps to&nbsp;Success
</p>
<p>The advances of leading companies, and their adoption of large-scale, collaborative 
</p>
<p>projects targeted directly at value creation through addressing the priorities of 
</p>
<p>global sustainable development, are beginning to demonstrate how business impact 
</p>
<p>can be scaled beyond incremental advances and efficiency gains. The 2013 CEO 
</p>
<p>Study, Architects of a Better World, identifies a group of &ldquo;Transformational Leaders&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>that combine sustainability leadership with market-leading business performance, 
</p>
<p>as measured by traditional metrics including revenue growth, profitability and 
</p>
<p>shareholder returns. These companies are approaching sustainability in markedly 
</p>
<p>different ways to those who are failing to achieve this distinction&nbsp;&ndash; with different 
</p>
<p>motivations, different influencers and different areas prioritized for investment, 
</p>
<p>innovation and action. At the heart of their approach is a strategy that moves beyond 
</p>
<p>reactive, incremental responses to external pressures and toward a new understand-
</p>
<p>ing of sustainability as an opportunity for innovation, competitive advantage, dif-
</p>
<p>ferentiation and growth. Leading CEOs are already uncovering strategies for 
</p>
<p>sustainability that allow them to deliver both value creation for their companies and 
</p>
<p>impact on global challenges; they are not waiting for others to act, but are actively 
</p>
<p>creating real value for consumers, investors and society.
</p>
<p>From leading multinationals like Siemens and Philips, whose portfolios of prod-
</p>
<p>ucts and services targeted at improving their customers&rsquo; environmental performance 
</p>
<p>now represent about half of their revenues, to smaller, disruptive innovators such as 
</p>
<p>Zipcar and Airbnb, companies are seizing new opportunities through innovation, 
</p>
<p>and devising new models and new ways of doing business. From the circular econ-
</p>
<p>omy to new digital businesses, these innovators are finding new ways to meet the 
</p>
<p>needs of their customers while impacting positively on the environment and 
</p>
<p>society.
</p>
<p>New models such as the Circular Economy are potential gamechangers in the 
</p>
<p>development of corporate sustainability, as innovators move from a lens of mitiga-
</p>
<p>tion and incremental improvement, to investment at scale in solutions, directly tar-
</p>
<p>geted at sustainability challenges that begin to decouple growth and prosperity from 
</p>
<p>environmental impact and resource degradation. In providing a unifying framework 
</p>
<p>that can solve the challenge of decoupling growth from environmental impact, 
</p>
<p>understood and implemented correctly the circular economy is a genuinely sys-
</p>
<p>temic&nbsp;&ndash; and potentially transformational&nbsp;&ndash; approach; it is radical new models like 
</p>
<p>these have the potential to shift the economy from an incremental path to a revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary one.
</p>
<p>Harnessing sustainability as a radical, transformative force will require a new 
</p>
<p>commitment from business leaders, as well as new skills and new ways of approach-
</p>
<p>ing sustainability. The CEO Study outlines seven key themes that CEOs believe can 
</p>
<p>guide their own thinking and actions, as well as transforming their companies&rsquo; strat-
</p>
<p>egies, business models, value chains and industries in order to achieve sustainability 
</p>
<p>leadership and high performance.

</p>
<p> 1. Realism and context: Understanding the scale of the challenge&nbsp;&ndash; and the 
</p>
<p>opportunity. Throughout our interviews, it was clear that companies taking the 
</p>
<p>most ambitious action on sustainability were also the most realistic about the 
</p>
<p>scale of the challenge&nbsp;&ndash; and are more likely to admit that business is not doing 
</p>
<p>enough. Understanding the challenge also allows these companies to appreciate 
</p>
<p>the opportunity for future growth in providing solutions to sustainability issues 
</p>
<p>and to target strategies to achieve it.
</p>
<p> 2. Growth and differentiation: Turning sustainability to advantage and value 
</p>
<p>creation. One of the clearest insights in our most recent research is the emer-
</p>
<p>gence of a two-speed world in sustainability, between those companies still 
</p>
<p>reacting to external expectations on sustainability and focusing on incremental 
</p>
<p>mitigation, and those that see sustainability through the lens of growth and dif-
</p>
<p>ferentiation. For leading companies, many CEOs told us that the urgency of 
</p>
<p>global challenges provides an opportunity to differentiate their products and ser-
</p>
<p>vices; to access new market segments; and to grow into new regions, countries 
</p>
<p>and areas where their products can meet a pressing need.
</p>
<p> 3. Value and performance: &ldquo;What gets measured gets managed.&rdquo; From carbon 
</p>
<p>emissions to water footprints, tracking environmental measures is now common-
</p>
<p>place across industries. Our research suggests that, for companies seeking to go 
</p>
<p>beyond incremental change and tackle global sustainability issues, the challenge 
</p>
<p>is twofold: not just to measure and manage metrics of reduction and mitigation, 
</p>
<p>but also to quantify the value of sustainability initiatives and more sustainable 
</p>
<p>business models to the company, and to track their impact on the communities in 
</p>
<p>which they operate.
</p>
<p> 4. Technology and innovation: New models for success. Our data suggests that 
</p>
<p>leading companies are turning to innovation and technology. Environmental and 
</p>
<p>resource constraints, and growing social pressures, are acting as a stimulus for 
</p>
<p>innovation: From investment in renewables, to intelligent infrastructure enabled 
</p>
<p>by machine-to-machine communications technology, to new Circular Economy 
</p>
<p>business models, leading companies are securing business advantage through 
</p>
<p>innovative R&amp;D and the deployment of technologies ranging from cloud com-
</p>
<p>puting to analytics.
</p>
<p> 5. Partnerships and collaboration: New challenges, new solutions. We have seen 
</p>
<p>a growing confidence from CEOs over the last decade that business can provide 
</p>
<p>solutions to tackle global challenges. In the context of intensifying pressures and 
</p>
<p>flagging efforts, CEOs more readily acknowledge the role of collaboration and 
</p>
<p>partnerships in meeting their ambitions on sustainability. Business can lead the 
</p>
<p>way, they believe, and can maximize companies&rsquo; impact through close partner-
</p>
<p>ships with governments, policymakers, industry peers, consumers and NGOs.
</p>
<p> 6. Engagement and dialogue: Broadening the conversation. Business leaders 
</p>
<p>are increasingly conscious of the need to establish a constructive, two-way 
</p>
<p>dialogue with consumers and local communities; regulators and policymakers; 
</p>
<p>investors and shareholders; employees and labor unions. Rather than simply 
</p>
<p>acting and then communicating, CEOs are actively engaging stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>negotiate the role of their business in addressing global challenges.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>516
</p>
<p> 7. Advocacy and leadership: Shaping future systems. Leading CEOs are clear 
</p>
<p>that business efforts are not sufficient to set the global economy on track&nbsp;&ndash; but 
</p>
<p>believe strongly that business should lead the way toward defining and delivering 
</p>
<p>a sustainable global economy, not least through the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>agenda. They are realistic that individually they can only have so much impact, 
</p>
<p>but recognize a need to play a part in collaborative solutions with governments 
</p>
<p>and other stakeholders. Business leaders&rsquo; advocacy and public commitment will 
</p>
<p>be integral to further progress (Fig.&nbsp;23.5).
</p>
<p> Impact and&nbsp;Value: A&nbsp;New Approach
</p>
<p>In the most recent study, CEOs were unequivocal in their belief that the global 
</p>
<p>economy is not on the right track&nbsp;&ndash; and that business is not doing enough to address 
</p>
<p>global sustainability challenges. They see their companies stuck on a plateau of 
</p>
<p>incremental achievement, uncertain of the way to the summit of greater impact and 
</p>
<p>business success. But among sustainability leaders, we can see the beginnings of a 
</p>
<p>collaborative, systems approach to sustainability, focused on the impact business 
</p>
<p>can make. These companies are seizing opportunities at speed through build-
</p>
<p>ing skills, measuring value and performance, and improving the dialogue with 
</p>
<p>consumers, investors and governments. Perhaps most importantly, they are aligning

</p>
<p>sustainability with value creation, and seeking to create real advantage&nbsp;&ndash; put another 
</p>
<p>way, competing through sustainability.
</p>
<p>We can see the seeds of a new approach to sustainability, with pockets of real 
</p>
<p>innovation both within the firm and beyond its four walls: collaborating within and 
</p>
<p>across industries and sectors, and working closely with stakeholders to develop the 
</p>
<p>beginnings of transformational change that can put in place an architecture that 
</p>
<p>mobilizes the business contribution to the post-2015 agenda. Through the innova-
</p>
<p>tions of these leaders, we begin to see a pathway for business to make rapid and 
</p>
<p>meaningful progress on the journey from sustainability&rsquo;s plateau of good intentions 
</p>
<p>toward a summit where global markets are aligned with sustainable development, 
</p>
<p>enabling business leaders to truly become the architects of a better world.
</p>
<p> Signposts to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Future: Towards Transformation
</p>
<p>The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, and the achievements 
</p>
<p>of the climate negotiations in Paris, mark a critical turning point in the history of 
</p>
<p>global development. As we look ahead to a new sustainable development agenda, 
</p>
<p>business and civil society leaders see an urgent need for the rejuvenation of a global 
</p>
<p>partnership focussed on development and prosperity.
</p>
<p>Following the landmark agreement at COP21, the international community has 
</p>
<p>an immediate opportunity to advance action through bold, ambitious and universal 
</p>
<p>action on climate. Paris marked a collective recognition that climate change is not 
</p>
<p>simply one element among multiple priorities: action to protect habitats, secure 
</p>
<p>livelihoods and enshrine environmental justice can provide the cornerstone of an 
</p>
<p>integrated development agenda and can lay the foundations of achievement across 
</p>
<p>all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
</p>
<p>But achieving ambitious goals will depend on the active engagement of business, 
</p>
<p>and unlocking the potential of the private sector will require enabling action on the 
</p>
<p>part of governments and policymakers. The innovation required to forge the transi-
</p>
<p>tion toward a low-carbon economy will depend on clear, coherent and consistent 
</p>
<p>policy frameworks that enable companies to invest with confidence and place the 
</p>
<p>big bets that will bring about new technologies and new business models to tackle 
</p>
<p>the challenges of the twenty-first century. Foremost among the challenges business, 
</p>
<p>government and civil society leaders face in rejuvenating their partnership for 
</p>
<p>development is working together effectively across sectors, understanding common 
</p>
<p>priorities and facilitating transformative action.
</p>
<p>The forthcoming edition of the triennial CEO Study, to be published later in 
</p>
<p>2016, will grant a unique opportunity to understand the views and priorities of busi-
</p>
<p>ness leaders in this new landscape. Foremost in the minds of the study team will be 
</p>
<p>understanding the progress of business since the last study in 2013, and the extent 
</p>
<p>to which individual leaders and companies have moved beyond their shared sense 
</p>
<p>of &lsquo;frustrated ambition&rsquo; towards a clear path to competitive advantage through lead-
</p>
<p>ership on sustainability.

<p>518
</p>
<p>The practical import of the Sustainable Development Goals, too, will provide a 
</p>
<p>key area of interest: after a decade in which progress has often been stifled by 
</p>
<p>unclear and competing expectations of companies to act on &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo;, could 
</p>
<p>the SDGs provide a new rallying point for discussions of purpose and value in busi-
</p>
<p>ness? Could &lsquo;Corporate Disruptors&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash; those companies finding a route to growth, 
</p>
<p>innovation and competitiveness through addressing global challenges&nbsp; &ndash; chart a 
</p>
<p>pathway towards new definitions of opportunity and success? And how will new 
</p>
<p>business models and new technologies allow companies to uncover new sources of 
</p>
<p>advantage through addressing the most pressing global challenges?
</p>
<p>During the decade&rsquo;s lifespan of the UN Global Compact-Accenture CEO Study, 
</p>
<p>we have traced the development of corporate sustainability from its roots in corpo-
</p>
<p>rate social responsibility towards the integration of environmental, social and gov-
</p>
<p>ernance issues as a critical element in strategies for growth. Aided by the momentum 
</p>
<p>of the UN&rsquo;s Agenda 2030, the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals and 
</p>
<p>the strides made at COP21&nbsp;in Paris, growing recognition of the scale of the chal-
</p>
<p>lenge has begun to translate into renewed advocacy for action: for perhaps the first 
</p>
<p>time, we are beginning to see a united front of business leaders and policymakers 
</p>
<p>setting their course toward a bold deal that can begin to close the gap between ambi-
</p>
<p>tion and execution.
</p>
<p>For the private sector, working in concert with policymakers and civil society, the 
</p>
<p>SDGs provide a global aspiration and common direction that can stimulate innova-
</p>
<p>tion, investment and engagement. As companies look to grow and innovate low- 
</p>
<p>carbon solutions to global challenges, they can lay the foundations of achievement, 
</p>
<p>offering opportunities for business to have a meaningful impact on societal chal-
</p>
<p>lenges through core business: new energy technologies are creating opportunities 
</p>
<p>for companies to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable energy for all; 
</p>
<p>climate-smart agriculture solutions help to achieve food security and promote sus-
</p>
<p>tainable farming; and new low-carbon technologies for cities will build resilient 
</p>
<p>infrastructure and promote inclusive, sustainable and prosperous industrialization.
</p>
<p>In the context of Agenda 2030, our research with CEOs shows a striking shift in 
</p>
<p>business leaders&rsquo; attitudes and commitment across the decade to 2015, with a major-
</p>
<p>ity of companies now looking beyond an incremental approach rooted in corporate 
</p>
<p>social responsibility to one motivated by the opportunities to scale innovative solu-
</p>
<p>tions. Many challenges lie ahead: in the assessment of business leaders themselves, 
</p>
<p>companies are not doing enough to invest in the solutions of the future, and are not 
</p>
<p>yet living up to their own expectations of corporate leadership.
</p>
<p>Advancing the role of business in tackling the greatest challenges we face will 
</p>
<p>depend on a new compact between business, governments and civil society, to work 
</p>
<p>together to unlock the potential of the private sector in delivering a shared vision for 
</p>
<p>a prosperous future.

<p>24A Case of&nbsp;Radical Reinvention: Umicore
Nigel&nbsp;Roome and&nbsp;Victoria&nbsp;Jadot
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Many companies have made commitments to some form of Corporate Social 
</p>
<p>Responsibility (CSR) and/or sustainability. Stating that a company is involved in 
</p>
<p>CSR or sustainability can mean many things as there is no universal, agreed view of 
</p>
<p>CSR or sustainability. Responsibility and sustainability are descriptive terms that 
</p>
<p>always require qualification provided by other words and more importantly actions. 
</p>
<p>In practice these big ideas are associated with a wide range of organizational prac-
</p>
<p>tices that are complex in their formulation, implementation and impact on the com-
</p>
<p>pany. By definition responsibility and sustainability also have implications for the 
</p>
<p>wider environment and society and the economic systems in which companies oper-
</p>
<p>ate. At one extreme they can imply little more than a commitment to a public rela-
</p>
<p>tions exercise or the company taking a public affairs position on an issue. At the 
</p>
<p>other extreme these big ideas represent highly strategic decisions to reposition a 
</p>
<p>company and its products and services in new relationship to the systems of produc-
</p>
<p>tion and consumption within which those products/services fit.
</p>
<p>Responsibility and sustainability continue to provide the ground for many com-
</p>
<p>peting and contested concepts and practices, few of which have been referenced 
</p>
<p>against the basic principles of the Brundtland Commission&rsquo;s (1987) and their semi-
</p>
<p>nal understanding of sustainable development. In the 27&nbsp;years since the Brundtland 
</p>
<p>Commission Report (1987) first articulated the rationale and principles for sustain-
</p>
<p>able social and economic development a plethora of concepts have been advanced 
</p>
<p>by academics and practitioners that provide an armoury of ideas, tools and actions 
</p>
<p>by which companies can contribute to sustainability. These have included a range of 
</p>
<p>concepts and the practices that follow from them such as the triple-bottom line 
</p>
<p>(Elkington 1994), eco-efficiency (DeSimone et&nbsp;al. 1997), industrial ecology (Frosch </p>

<p>1995), base of the pyramid (Hart, REF), environmental stewardship (Cargill 2012) 
</p>
<p>or, creating shared value (Porter and Kramer 2011; Nestl&eacute; 2010). Some companies 
</p>
<p>associate strongly with these concepts while some do not make use of these con-
</p>
<p>cepts at all.
</p>
<p>Unilever, for example, has interpreted its contribution to sustainability in terms 
</p>
<p>of growing its business by producing products with social value while taking strides 
</p>
<p>to reduce the main environmental impacts of those products by given amounts 
</p>
<p>(Unilever 2014). It sets out to do this by seeking out new business opportunities for 
</p>
<p>innovative products and services that have less environmental impact. And by per-
</p>
<p>suading customers to behave differently (Unilever 2014). The company identifies 
</p>
<p>this approach because it recognizes that the environmental impacts of the fast mov-
</p>
<p>ing consumer goods it sells mostly arise during their use by consumers and not 
</p>
<p>during their manufacture.
</p>
<p>Unilever is among a rather small group of companies that have acknowledged 
</p>
<p>that sustainability is first and foremost defined by a state of social and economic 
</p>
<p>development that operates within the environmental limits or carrying capacity of 
</p>
<p>the planet. Managers in companies that take this view recognize that while they are 
</p>
<p>economic agents whose role is to help their companies succeed as profit seeking 
</p>
<p>organizations at the same time they are concerned about how their current and future 
</p>
<p>products and services contribute to the sustainability or otherwise of the social and 
</p>
<p>economic systems in which they operate. This position raises fundamental ques-
</p>
<p>tions about how a company creates, captures and distributes value whilst also giving 
</p>
<p>consideration to the value that is often destroyed through the sourcing, production 
</p>
<p>and use of those products.
</p>
<p>There are other notable examples of companies that have subscribed to this 
</p>
<p>broader view of sustainable (economic and social) development. In the early 1990s 
</p>
<p>Ontario Hydro, did not define sustainability in terms of the &lsquo;company&rsquo; or the &lsquo;com-
</p>
<p>pany and its supply-chain&rsquo;, rather it set out to devise a strategy for the sustainability 
</p>
<p>of the system of energy development and use in the province of Ontario, Canada 
</p>
<p>(Roome and Bergin 2006). The ambition of the strategy was to reshape the compa-
</p>
<p>ny&rsquo;s actions and to influence the work of other actors in the energy system of the 
</p>
<p>province of Ontario.
</p>
<p>Companies that look at revising the portfolio of products and services they pro-
</p>
<p>vide often make use of some key concepts that help them to rethink the way their 
</p>
<p>company might contribute to systems change toward sustainability. These concepts 
</p>
<p>include the idea of &lsquo;closed-loop production and consumption systems&rsquo;, the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of practices around &lsquo;cradle-to-cradle&rsquo; thinking (McDonough and 
</p>
<p>Braungart 2002) or by drawing on the principles of The Natural Step (Robert et&nbsp;al. 
</p>
<p>1997).
</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the case of Umicore &ndash; a Belgium company that sought 
</p>
<p>to reinvent its approach to business as a way to contribute to sustainable develop-
</p>
<p>ment. At the beginning of the case Umicore was a conventional materials company 
</p>
<p>that sourced metal ores mined in Africa, that were transported and processed in 
</p>
<p>Belgium and other sites, then to be manufactured into products that were sold for 
</p>
<p>applications around the World. Umicore&rsquo;s operations were based on the idea of 
</p>
<p>N. Roome and V. Jadot</p>
<p/>

<p>521
</p>
<p>material through-put&nbsp;&ndash; an approach that has dominated much industrial activity over 
</p>
<p>the last 150&nbsp;years. In this model the company&rsquo;s financial performance accompanies 
</p>
<p>the sale of more and more products while costs are controlled.
</p>
<p>For reasons discussed later in the chapter, senior managers at Umicore deter-
</p>
<p>mined that the future lay in positioning the company at the centre of a closed mate-
</p>
<p>rial loop, where materials, recovered at the end of existing uses, would be reprocessed 
</p>
<p>and manufactured into products that were then used in areas of the economy that are 
</p>
<p>springing up in response to different environmental challenges. In this new approach 
</p>
<p>success would depend on the company&rsquo;s ability to source, process, remanufacture, 
</p>
<p>sell and then recover material. Success would also be determined by the ability to 
</p>
<p>manage the transformation of the company from its focus original approach based 
</p>
<p>on throughput to this circular material process.
</p>
<p>This chapter does not examine the validity of the claims made for closed loop 
</p>
<p>production-consumption systems as a contribution to sustainable development 
</p>
<p>rather the aim is to describe the process of transformative change that took place at 
</p>
<p>Umicore. The chapter pinpoints the main internal and external factors that drove 
</p>
<p>this process, and identifies the internal forces that enabled actors in the company to 
</p>
<p>bring about that change. In particularly it focuses on the roles and the beliefs held 
</p>
<p>by internal change agents who lead the process of change.
</p>
<p>The overall objective of the chapter is to inform our understanding of the pro-
</p>
<p>cesses of organizational change that contribute to this type of strategic transforma-
</p>
<p>tion: An understanding that can contribute to theory as well as to practice.
</p>
<p>To this end the chapter is divided into four main sections. Section &ldquo;Case Method&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>provides a brief account of the methods used to collect data and the access to the 
</p>
<p>company. Section &ldquo;Introduction to Umicore and the Case&rdquo; provides a brief intro-
</p>
<p>duction to Umicore as a company. It then provides a narrative account of change 
</p>
<p>process at Umicore over the 19&nbsp; years covered by the case. Section &ldquo;Economic 
</p>
<p>Restructuring&nbsp;&ndash; The Industrial Plan&rdquo; discusses the process and the roles and beliefs 
</p>
<p>of those responsible for the change process that is described in light of ideas from 
</p>
<p>theory. The chapter ends with some concluding remarks.
</p>
<p> Case Method
</p>
<p>A case study approach was used to gain insight of the change process at Umicore. 
</p>
<p>Case studies are the preferred method to use when &ldquo;how&rdquo; or &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions are 
</p>
<p>being posed, when the investigator has little control over events, and the focus is on 
</p>
<p>a contemporary phenomenon within a real-life context (Yin 2009). Case study 
</p>
<p>research is also held to be particularly appropriate when the boundary between the 
</p>
<p>phenomenon under investigation and its social context is blurred (Yin 2009). We 
</p>
<p>assumed this was the situation as our focus was on a process of change that involved 
</p>
<p>the organization interacting with its wider social and economic context. The case 
</p>
<p>deals with past and recent processes of change over a long period. In that way the 
</p>
<p>past provides a context to the present, and the present unfolds and shapes the future. 
</p>
<p>No other method seemed appropriate given the extended time period of the case.

</p>
<p>The case qualifies as a reconstructed longitudinal case which according to Yin 
</p>
<p>(2009), is best studied in a single-case study,
</p>
<p>A qualitative approach enabled account to be taken of Umicore&rsquo;s changing con-
</p>
<p>text. In addition a sensemaking approach (Basu and Palazzo 2008) was used to 
</p>
<p>provide insight into how people involved in the case thought, spoke and behaved in 
</p>
<p>relation to the concepts of responsibility and sustainability: As this would help to 
</p>
<p>understand how these ideas influenced the strategic change at Umicore.
</p>
<p>Data for the case were collected in two stages: first through desk research based 
</p>
<p>on documents published by and about Umicore. This was followed by the collection 
</p>
<p>of primary data gained through semi-structured interviews with key informants who 
</p>
<p>worked for, or who had worked for, Umicore during the period of the case.
</p>
<p>The desk research made use of material from the internet published by Umicore, 
</p>
<p>from the press coverage of the company and visits to Umicore. This material was 
</p>
<p>used to validate evidence from other sources. It was recognized that most of these 
</p>
<p>documents were written for some specific purpose and specific audiences other than 
</p>
<p>the case study reported here.
</p>
<p>Interviews were crucial to the construct of the case study. Interviews took the 
</p>
<p>form of guided conversations rather than structured enquiries. As a result of the 
</p>
<p>documentary analysis six key people were identified as interviewees. The inter-
</p>
<p>views began with Guy Ethier (current Vice-President Environment, Health and 
</p>
<p>Safety, with Umicore since 2001), Moniek Delvou (Corporate Communications 
</p>
<p>Director from 1999 to 2003) and Marc Dolfyn (Corporate Human Resources 
</p>
<p>Director, with Umicore since 2003). These interviews provided a better knowledge 
</p>
<p>of the transformation at Umicore. They were then followed by interviews with the 
</p>
<p>three CEO&rsquo;s that had led Umicore over the period of the case &ndash; Marc Grynberg (cur-
</p>
<p>rent CEO, and with Umicore since 1996), Karel Vinck (former CEO and former 
</p>
<p>Chairman of Umicore, 1994&ndash;2008) and Thomas Leysen (former CEO and current 
</p>
<p>Chairman, with Umicore since 1989).
</p>
<p>A short list of key questions was created for each interviewee. The interviews 
</p>
<p>were conducted in an open-ended way but following a certain set of questions 
</p>
<p>derived from the questions guideline. Attention was given to the advice by Yin 
</p>
<p>(2009) that &ldquo;specific questions must be carefully worded, so that the interviewer 
</p>
<p>appears genuinely na&iuml;ve about the topic and allows the interviewee to provide a 
</p>
<p>fresh commentary about it&rdquo; (Yin 2009).
</p>
<p>The material from these interviews was used to construct and label the phases in 
</p>
<p>the change process that were used to structure the case narrative. Because the inter-
</p>
<p>viewees could be subject to the common problems of perceptual bias, poor recall, or 
</p>
<p>poor and inaccurate articulation, the accounts of the respondents were cross-checked 
</p>
<p>for consistency.
</p>
<p>Interviews lasted about 45&ndash;60&nbsp;min each. All interviews except one were done in 
</p>
<p>English, and were recorded with the permission of the interviewer. All recorded 
</p>
<p>interviews were transcribed and retained. One interview could not be recorded 
</p>
<p>because of background noise. In this case notes were taken manually and tran-
</p>
<p>scribed afterwards. This interview was done in Dutch, as preferred by the 
</p>
<p>interviewee.

</p>
<p>While the case itself cannot be replicated the following controls were used to 
</p>
<p>ensure the reliability of the data that was collected to construct the narrative of 
</p>
<p>Umicore (a) multiple sources of evidence were used to develop converging lines of 
</p>
<p>inquiry and to provide confirmation of the data, (b) a case study database was devel-
</p>
<p>oped and stored which provides a collection of evidence separate and distinctive 
</p>
<p>from the final case study report, and (c) a chain of evidence was sought (Yin 2009). 
</p>
<p>This chain of evidence explicitly links the questions asked, the data collected and 
</p>
<p>the conclusions drawn. &ldquo;The principle is to allow an external observer&nbsp;&ndash; in this situ-
</p>
<p>ation, the reader of the case study&nbsp;&ndash; to follow the derivation of any evidence from 
</p>
<p>initial research questions to ultimate case study conclusions&rdquo; (Yin 2009).
</p>
<p>Data from the documentary review and interviews were analysed and compared. 
</p>
<p>The data comprised a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information, with an 
</p>
<p>emphasis on the written and spoken word. Given the explorative nature of the 
</p>
<p>research and our concern to understand how approaches to corporate responsibility 
</p>
<p>and sustainability were understood and developed, we did not apply specific ana-
</p>
<p>lytical techniques to the raw material.
</p>
<p>Interviews were transcribed and compared with documents and archival records 
</p>
<p>with the intent to develop an authentic record of how CSR/sustainability was under-
</p>
<p>stood and communicated in the company. Where possible the case was written to 
</p>
<p>include the images, materials and language that senior managers used to describe 
</p>
<p>the CSR strategy and practices in their business. Indeed, managers were explicitly 
</p>
<p>asked to describe how the leaders proceeded to the organizational change. A final 
</p>
<p>draft of the case was sent to Thomas Leysen, Chairman of Umicore, and to Bart 
</p>
<p>Crols, Corporate Communication manager, who assessed the historical correctness 
</p>
<p>of the data.
</p>
<p>We acknowledge that our findings cannot be generalized. However, that was not 
</p>
<p>the purpose of the study. The single case study provides an in-depth analysis of 
</p>
<p>organizational change around CSR and sustainable development and the contribu-
</p>
<p>tion of individuals and groups to that change process.
</p>
<p> Introduction to&nbsp;Umicore and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Case
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Umicore has a history going back 200&nbsp;years. Today&rsquo;s materials-technology com-
</p>
<p>pany is the outcome of a history of mergers, acquisitions and transformations by 
</p>
<p>companies in the mining and refining industry. Umicore has only recently evolved 
</p>
<p>into a materials-technology provider. Moreover Umicore does not have an unblem-
</p>
<p>ished past. Changing company practices and social expectations led to a series of 
</p>
<p>scandals that stained the company&rsquo;s reputation. These include: the extremely hard 
</p>
<p>living and working conditions of employees in the Congo, seizure of uranium by the 
</p>
<p>Germans and then deliveries of the same material to the Americans during WWII 
</p>
<p>and&nbsp;&ndash; most importantly&nbsp;&ndash; environmental pollution and associated health concerns 
</p>
<p>among employees and neighbours surrounding sites where metal ores were

</p>
<p>processed. At the beginning of the 1990s, Union Mini&egrave;re&nbsp; &ndash; the former name of 
</p>
<p>Umicore&nbsp;&ndash; was also coping with extremely bad financial results&nbsp;&ndash; the company was 
</p>
<p>almost bankrupt.
</p>
<p>Today Umicore describes itself as a materials group that focuses on clean tech-
</p>
<p>nologies. It employs more than 13,000 people. It continues to deliver outstanding 
</p>
<p>financial results and regularly outperforms the BEL20. On top of that, it has been 
</p>
<p>externally acknowledged as a flagship of sustainability, receiving praise for its con-
</p>
<p>tribution to sustainable development. It has won multiple awards in this area.1 It is 
</p>
<p>a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development2 and is 
</p>
<p>included in the FTSE4Good Index.3 In 2014 the company was ranked 9th in The 
</p>
<p>Global 100 list for clean capitalism.4
</p>
<p>In its current form, group Umicore operates through four business areas: 
</p>
<p>Advanced Materials, Precious Metals Products and Catalysts, Precious Metals 
</p>
<p>Services and Zinc Specialties. Each business area is divided into market-focused 
</p>
<p>business units.
</p>
<p>The Advanced Materials business area produces high-purity metals, alloys, com-
</p>
<p>pounds and engineered products for a range of advanced applications. The main 
</p>
<p>materials used are cobalt, germanium and nickel. The business area is composed of 
</p>
<p>three business units: cobalt and specialty materials, electro-optic materials and thin 
</p>
<p>film products. Furthermore, the advanced materials business group comprises a 
</p>
<p>40% shareholding in Element Six Abrasives, which produces synthetic diamonds 
</p>
<p>and abrasive materials for use in industrial tools.
</p>
<p>The Advanced Materials business area makes products such as rechargeable bat-
</p>
<p>tery materials and germanium wafers for solar cells.
</p>
<p>The Precious Metals Products and Catalysts business area produces a range of 
</p>
<p>complex functional materials based on precious metals and its expertise in technol-
</p>
<p>ogy platforms such as catalysis and surface technology. The business is organized in 
</p>
<p>five business units: automotive catalysts, catalyst technologies, jewellery and elec-
</p>
<p>troplating, platinum engineered materials and technical materials. This business 
</p>
<p>group produces products such as catalysts used in automotive emission systems.
</p>
<p>The Precious Metals Services business area is the world market leader in recy-
</p>
<p>cling complex waste containing precious and other non-ferrous metals. Its core 
</p>
<p>business is to provide refining and recycling services to an international customer 
</p>

</p>
<p>base. It is divided into three business units: precious metals refining, precious met-
</p>
<p>als management and battery recycling. The Precious Metals Services business group 
</p>
<p>offers services such as recycling.
</p>
<p>The Zinc Specialties business area develops zinc-based materials for a wide vari-
</p>
<p>ety of applications. Zinc Specialties is organized around three business units: zinc 
</p>
<p>chemicals, building products and zinc battery materials. The Zincs Specialties busi-
</p>
<p>ness area produces, for instance, materials for building applications such as 
</p>
<p>roofing.
</p>
<p>Umicore generates approximately 50% of its revenues and spends approximately 
</p>
<p>80% of its research and development budget in the area of clean technology. This 
</p>
<p>includes areas such as emission control catalysts, fuel cells, materials for recharge-
</p>
<p>able batteries, photovoltaic systems, and precious metals recycling. Research &amp; 
</p>
<p>development for clean and sustainable technologies is mainly done in Olen. There 
</p>
<p>are also Business Unit dedicated research centres in Germany, Japan, Canada, 
</p>
<p>France and Liechtenstein.
</p>
<p>Umicore articulates the group&rsquo;s goal and mission in the form of the &lsquo;Umicore 
</p>
<p>Way&rsquo;: it states &ldquo;Umicore&rsquo;s overriding goal of sustainable value creation is based on 
</p>
<p>the ambition to develop, produce and recycle materials in a way that fulfils its mis-
</p>
<p>sion: materials for a better life.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Umicore recorded a turnover of &euro; 6.9 billion in 2009, with an EBIT (Earnings 
</p>
<p>Before Interest and Taxes) margin of 8,9% and a ROCE (Return On Capital 
</p>
<p>Employed) of 8,2%. Umicore shares are listed on Euronext Brussels with 100% free 
</p>
<p>float. Umicore is part of the BEL 20, the benchmark stock market index of Euronext 
</p>
<p>Brussels, and does not have a reference shareholder.
</p>
<p>At end of 2009, Umicore had 13.720 employees, located in 37 countries on 5 
</p>
<p>continents, in 79 production sites and 48 other sites. More than half of Umicore&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>employees were working in Umicore&rsquo;s largest production centres in Belgium. The 
</p>
<p>other main centres of employment were 2.963 people in Germany 2.296 and 2.225&nbsp;in 
</p>
<p>China.
</p>
<p>Umicore has a dual governance structure consisting of a supervisory Board of 
</p>
<p>Directors and an Executive Committee. The Board of Directors, consists of at least 
</p>
<p>six members appointed by the Shareholders&rsquo; Meeting, Their normal term of office 
</p>
<p>is 4&nbsp; years, although re-election is possible. At the end of the case the Board of 
</p>
<p>Directors consisted of ten members: nine non-executive directors and one executive 
</p>
<p>director. On 31 December 2009, six of the ten directors were independent within the 
</p>
<p>definition of independence defined by Umicore&rsquo;s Corporate Governance Charter.
</p>
<p>Thomas Leysen had been the Chairman of Umicore since November 2008 after 
</p>
<p>serving as Chief Executive Officer from 2000 to 2008. In addition he has numerous 
</p>
<p>other functions on the board of other companies. Marc Grynberg was Chief 
</p>
<p>Executive Officer of Umicore from November 2008, succeeding Thomas Leysen. 
</p>
<p>He joined Umicore in 1996 as Group Controller. He was Umicore&rsquo;s CFO from 2000 
</p>
<p>until 2006, after which he became the head of the Group&rsquo;s Automotive Catalysts 
</p>
<p>business unit until his appointment as Chief Executive Officer. Marc Grynberg 
</p>
<p>holds a Commercial Engineering degree from the University of Brussels (Ecole de

<p>Commerce Solvay). Prior to joining Umicore he worked for DuPont de Nemours in 
</p>
<p>Brussels and Geneva.
</p>
<p>The Executive Committee is composed of at least four members. It is chaired by 
</p>
<p>the Chief Executive Officer, who is appointed by the Board of Directors. The Board 
</p>
<p>of Directors appoints the other members of the Executive Committee upon recom-
</p>
<p>mendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
</p>
<p>Senior Management is composed of representatives of the four business areas, as 
</p>
<p>well as corporate vice-presidents in the areas of R&amp;D, legal affairs, and Environment, 
</p>
<p>Health and Safety (EHS).
</p>
<p>In 2008 (the end point of this case study), Umicore was a materials group with a 
</p>
<p>strong focus on recycling and transforming metals into materials that are used in 
</p>
<p>sectors driven by environmental concerns. This is shown in Fig.&nbsp;24.1. This caused 
</p>
<p>Umicore to be recognized as a flagship of sustainability with a strategic focus on 
</p>
<p>materials that contribute to clean technologies and eco-efficiency.
</p>
<p>Umicore approach to sustainability continues to distinguish between the sustain-
</p>
<p>ability of its context as distinct from its sustainability as an organization, the direct 
</p>
<p>impacts of its operations and its position as an organization with employees that is 
</p>
<p>embedded in society. The company says:
</p>
<p>we are a company that plays a major role in providing products and services that are 
enablers of a more sustainable future.
</p>
<p>While our products can make a positive difference in the world we are also committed 
to ensuring our operations are run in such a way as to minimize our environmental foot-
print. We also undertake to be the best possible employer and neighbour and to adopt the 
best standards of business ethics and governance both within Umicore and through our 
supply chain. (Umicore 2014)
</p>
<p> The Case
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig.&nbsp;24.2 a key moment in Umicore&rsquo;s history arose in 1989, when Union 
</p>
<p>Mini&egrave;re merged with its subsidiaries, Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt (copper, lead,

</p>
<p>cobalt, germanium, precious metals and special metals), Vieille-Montagne (zinc) 
</p>
<p>and Mechim (engineering).
</p>
<p>The oldest of Umicore&rsquo;s predecessor companies, Vieille-Montagne was created 
</p>
<p>in 1805. Another predecessor, Union Mini&egrave;re du Haut Katanga (UMHK), started its 
</p>
<p>activities in 1906. UMHK mined the rich mineral resources of Belgium&rsquo;s former 
</p>
<p>colony of the Congo (copper, cobalt, tin and precious metals). UMHK expanded 
</p>
<p>rapidly: between 1913 and 1917 production quadrupled because UMHK supplied 
</p>
<p>the basic materials for weapons manufacture (van Caloen 2001). Non-ferrous met-
</p>
<p>als were transported to be processed in Europe&nbsp; &ndash; for instance at Metallurgie 
</p>
<p>Hoboken- Overpelt, which would later merge with UMHK.&nbsp;The most prosperous 
</p>
<p>years for UMHK were the post-WWII years: in 1955, UMHK employed 21.000 
</p>
<p>workers and 1.915 European agents in Congo. After the Zairian government nation-
</p>
<p>alized UMHK&rsquo;s assets in 1968, Union Mini&egrave;re set out to develop new mining activi-
</p>
<p>ties to feed its refining capacity. It eventually became a sub-holding company of the 
</p>
<p>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Belgique.
</p>
<p>Historically, Union Mini&egrave;re was a financially well performing company albeit in 
</p>
<p>a cyclical industry. However, after the company left the Congo as a result of the 
</p>
<p>nationalization of the mines in 1968, it had to invest in new mines. These investment 
</p>
<p>decisions were unsound leading to a very bad financial situation in the beginning of 
</p>
<p>the 1990s on top of the cyclical nature of the business.
</p>
<p>In 1989, 88,2% of the shares of Union Mini&egrave;re belonged to the Belgian conglom-
</p>
<p>erate Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Belgique. This company had appointed a French CEO, 
</p>
<p>Jean- Pierre Rodier.

</p>
<p>Umicore has had to deal with serious social and environmental concerns. First of 
</p>
<p>all, UMHK employed an increasing number of African workers in the beginning of 
</p>
<p>the twentieth century: 8.500&nbsp; in 1919, 17.200&nbsp; in 1929 (Brion and Moreau 2006). 
</p>
<p>Such an expansion in the sparsely populated Katanga province obliged the company 
</p>
<p>to recruit massively outside Katanga, in particular in Rhodesia and in other 
</p>
<p>Congolese provinces. Public opinion in Belgium was not always in favour of recruit-
</p>
<p>ing workers hundreds of kilometres outside their hometown. In addition, the living 
</p>
<p>conditions of the African workforce in Katanga were very harsh. Second, Union 
</p>
<p>Mini&egrave;re was the principal producer of uranium when WWII started. During the war, 
</p>
<p>the German government seized some 2.000&nbsp;tons of uranate. The American govern-
</p>
<p>ment used uranium supplied by Union Mini&egrave;re to create the nuclear bombs dropped 
</p>
<p>on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Third, as public awareness of environmental issues 
</p>
<p>increased in the 1980s and 1990s Union Mini&egrave;re started to realize it had to cope 
</p>
<p>with historical legacy of pollution at its production sites in Belgium and elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>This was the most important problem Union Mini&egrave;re had to deal with.
</p>
<p>From the interviews, we distinguished five phases in the organizational change at 
</p>
<p>Umicore, which are shown in Fig.&nbsp;24.3. These phases are used to structure the case 
</p>
<p>narrative set out below.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s Union Mini&egrave;re was well-known for its technical 
</p>
<p>competence, however the company was dealing with two principal problems. The 
</p>
<p>financial viability of the company and a series of reputational problems then linked 
</p>
<p>to environmental pollution. Although these problems had been developing for some

</p>
<p>time, in the early 1990s, there was a growing public and political concern and an 
</p>
<p>increasing awareness that it was time they were addressed.
</p>
<p>Union Mini&egrave;re was aware of both problems, but it gave priority to resolving its 
</p>
<p>financial problems as it was held that unless this was solved, the company couldn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>survive and the environmental problems would not be addressed.
</p>
<p>Financial problems resulted from the bad investments in the 1970s and the 1980s 
</p>
<p>when the company left the Congo and invested in new mines, for instance in Canada, 
</p>
<p>as well as a project to prospect for metals on the bottom of the sea. These invest-
</p>
<p>ments generated poor returns and there were few reserves left. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, 
</p>
<p>which held almost 50% of the shares in Union Mini&egrave;re, realized the situation at 
</p>
<p>Union Miniere needed dramatic change.
</p>
<p>Etienne Davignon, then Chairman of Union Mini&egrave;re, contacted Karel Vinck, 
</p>
<p>then the CEO of Bekaert, to help Union Mini&egrave;re survive the financial situation. 
</p>
<p>Etienne Davignon did not play a significant role in the operational and financial 
</p>
<p>turnaround of the company but he became involved with sustainability issues. From 
</p>
<p>1998, he hosted the first Advisory Board of CSR Europe and became one of the 
</p>
<p>leaders of this initiative. In 2001, Etienne Davignon contributed to the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of the European Academy of Business and Society, a multi-stakeholder plat-
</p>
<p>form on CSR.
</p>
<p>Marc Grynberg, the CEO of Umicore at the time of the case, summarizes the 
</p>
<p>situation as follows: &ldquo;In the mid-1990s Union Mini&egrave;re was in a really bad shape 
</p>
<p>with fairly outdated industrial assets, lousy profitability and not a very strong posi-
</p>
<p>tioning on the market place.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Karel Vinck had a reputation as a turn-around manager. He had transformed the 
</p>
<p>company Eternit in the 1980s and was then restructuring Bekaert. He joined Union 
</p>
<p>Mini&egrave;re at the end of 1994. Karel Vinck thinks he was appointed because his experi-
</p>
<p>ences at Eternit and Bekaert, and his excellent relationship with the workers&rsquo; unions.
</p>
<p>The company was fully aware of its environmental problems as its sites had been 
</p>
<p>polluting for over 100&nbsp;years. Early in 1992 the company recognized that the envi-
</p>
<p>ronment was a major strategic issue. It was decided to establish a central environ-
</p>
<p>ment division for the whole Union Mini&egrave;re group to provide an organizational 
</p>
<p>structure for the management of environmental issues in the company. One of the 
</p>
<p>first actions of the division was to develop an Environment Charter. It was drafted 
</p>
<p>by the corporate environment group, after much internal discussion until the man-
</p>
<p>agement committee agreed that it covered all the essential values Union Mini&egrave;re 
</p>
<p>would like to respect.
</p>
<p> Economic Restructuring: The&nbsp;Industrial Plan
</p>
<p>When Karel Vinck&rsquo;s took over as CEO at the end of 1994, he launched a restructur-
</p>
<p>ing plan for the period 1995&ndash;1998. He involved top management and used a mixture 
</p>
<p>of a top-down and a bottom-up approaches to implement the plan. It was top-down 
</p>
<p>in the sense that he was guided the operational aspects of the plans, had the final 
</p>
<p>word on decisions and took full responsibility. On the other hand, it was bottom-up 
</p>
<p>24 A Case of&nbsp;Radical Reinvention: Umicore</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>530
</p>
<p>because Karel Vinck considered that he could not make the new strategy work from 
</p>
<p>his office but instead he had to be in contact with the internal mood of the company 
</p>
<p>and communicate in informal ways with the workforce. In other words, this process 
</p>
<p>of implementation was formal (e.g. Board decisions) as well as informal (e.g. chat-
</p>
<p>ting with the employees on the work floor). Karel Vinck had relied on these skills 
</p>
<p>and this combined approach in previous restructuring and believed it is 
</p>
<p>effectiveness.
</p>
<p>The plan was based on investment of BEF 22 billion. (40,3399 BEF&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&euro;) over 
</p>
<p>the period 1995&ndash;1998 to finance the gradual replacement of refining activities (e.g. 
</p>
<p>zinc, copper) with new (higher margin) industrial activities based on technologies 
</p>
<p>that were then available to the company. Union Mini&egrave;re already had a number of 
</p>
<p>product applications available, such as materials for batteries and solar cells. The 
</p>
<p>Industrial Plan focused on developing these areas further. Special emphasis was 
</p>
<p>placed on innovation. This was given greater profile when Karel Vinck created a 
</p>
<p>single global R&amp;D centre in Olen, to replace the R&amp;D activities that were previ-
</p>
<p>ously dispersed over three different sites. In addition the Industrial Plan involved 
</p>
<p>cost-cutting, requiring some 2.000 jobs to be lost (about 15% of the work force), 
</p>
<p>accompanied by the sale of divisions with lower margins. Only those divisions in 
</p>
<p>which Union Mini&egrave;re could become a world leader were retained.
</p>
<p>Karel Vinck involve the rest of the management as closely as possible in his deci-
</p>
<p>sions and in 1995&ndash;1996, Union Mini&egrave;re adopted a Company Charter, as a first 
</p>
<p>attempt to define the objectives that would bind the company together. This included 
</p>
<p>commitments to respect the legal environment and human rights, to reject fraud and 
</p>
<p>corruption, to show openness and transparency, and to respect the environment 
</p>
<p>everywhere it operates. The company charter followed after the environment charter 
</p>
<p>and included some of it principles.
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig.&nbsp; 24.4, the Industrial Plan began to show in better financial 
</p>
<p>results. In 1996 the company recorded a profit for the first time since 1990. The 
</p>
<p>1997 results led to a gross dividend payment of BEF 44 per share (40,3399 
</p>
<p>BEF&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&euro;) again for the first time since 1990,
</p>
<p>In terms of environmental problems and reputation Karel Vinck, said you 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t have dreamed of having the political support [sic for the company] with 
</p>
<p>an image that would have been that of the worst polluting company in Belgium&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>Hence, Union Mini&egrave;re had to take measures and dedicate funds to its environmental 
</p>
<p>problems and it had to communicate its new approach both internally and to the 
</p>
<p>external world.
</p>
<p>The reactive environmental action was set in place through an agreement Union 
</p>
<p>Mini&egrave;re and OVAM under the supervision of the Minister of the Environment in 
</p>
<p>December 1997. (OVAM stands for Openbare Afvalstoffenmaatschappij voor het 
</p>
<p>Vlaams Gewest&nbsp;&ndash; Public Waste Agency of Flanders). This agreement, for a period 
</p>
<p>of 10&nbsp; years, covered the investigation of pollution sites and soil remediation to 
</p>
<p>remove all the serious risks arising from the historical pollution at Union Mini&egrave;re&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Flemish production sites. The agreement was entered into under the wider scope of 
</p>
<p>a Flemish Soil Remediation Decree which came into force 22nd February 1995. 
</p>
<p>Union Mini&egrave;re could not afford to have further environmental problems and compli-
</p>
<p>ance with the environmental regulations was a &ldquo;must do&rdquo;.
</p>
<p> Conceptualization and&nbsp;Learning: The&nbsp;First Formulation 
of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Strategic Approach to&nbsp;Responsibility
</p>
<p>Once the Industrial Plan began to yield results the company started to look for ideas 
</p>
<p>to resolve the reputational problems that followed its environmental legacy as this 
</p>
<p>would that dog its future. People inside the company were encouraged to start think-
</p>
<p>ing about responses that would help resolve the future financial position of the com-
</p>
<p>pany together with its reputational problems. After all, the company had experienced 
</p>
<p>financial and environmental problems because of the way it operated and the thought 
</p>
<p>was that those problems might be resolved through the way it operated in the future.
</p>
<p>However, this meant addressing the raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre for the emerging company. 
</p>
<p>Thomas Leysen remembers three principal ideas: &ldquo;First of all we wanted to be a 
</p>
<p>company that was active in fields where it could make a difference through technol-
</p>
<p>ogy. Secondly we wanted to be active in fields where we could have leadership 
</p>
<p>positions on a global basis. Thirdly we wanted to integrate the sustainable develop-
</p>
<p>ment thinking, not only in our operations, but also in our strategy and that this 
</p>
<p>would be a core part of what we wanted to be as a company and this applied notably 
</p>
<p>to a very large commitment to recycling. We saw this as a possibility for us to dif-
</p>
<p>ferentiate ourselves and to make a real contribution.&rdquo; Moreover, the company 
</p>
<p>wanted to move from pollution reduction to pollution prevention and through that 
</p>
<p>redesign itself and its operations to avoid pollution as much as possible. These prin-
</p>
<p>ciples informed the vision for the company that was emerging. Some key concepts 
</p>
<p>were then identified through which to drive towards that emerging vision&nbsp;&ndash; these 
</p>
<p>concepts were to become a closed loop company with a commitment to environ-
</p>
<p>ment and clean technology applications, where the environment was an opportunity 
</p>
<p>not a constraint.
</p>
<p>The operational practices needed to make these concepts a reality developed 
</p>
<p>gradually. In 1998 Thomas Leysen took over the lead in the Cobalt and Specialty 
</p>
<p>Materials business unit. He knew the company very well as he had held different 
</p>
<p>positions within Union Mini&egrave;re during the previous 10&nbsp;years. Together with Karel 
</p>

<p>532
</p>
<p>Vinck he decided to test the new idea of being a closed loop company beginning 
</p>
<p>with the Cobalt and Specialty Materials business group. The two men worked 
</p>
<p>closely together building on Karel Vinck&rsquo;s experience gained outside the company 
</p>
<p>and Thomas Leysen long career with Union Mini&egrave;re. &ldquo;We really understood each 
</p>
<p>other and respected each other and I guess the success of Umicore today is linked to 
</p>
<p>the fact that the CEO and the Chairman had an excellent relationship&rdquo; believes 
</p>
<p>Karel Vinck.
</p>
<p>The Cobalt and Specialty Materials business group provided Thomas Leysen 
</p>
<p>with the test bed where he could explore and develop the closed loop approach on a 
</p>
<p>small scale. This was based on the recycling and recovery of used material that were 
</p>
<p>then processed into new products. In addition Thomas Leysen tried to proactively 
</p>
<p>manage the company&rsquo;s overall environmental position by preparing the business for 
</p>
<p>upcoming legislation, coming trends, and how it should be ahead of the curve on the 
</p>
<p>environmental side. This would require close contact with employees to encourage 
</p>
<p>their engagement in change that was necessary from these developments.
</p>
<p>This approach to explore closed loop production and to develop a forward look-
</p>
<p>ing approach was supported by the development of a more formal structured man-
</p>
<p>agement system. In 1998, Union Mini&egrave;re adopted their first Environmental 
</p>
<p>Management System and published their first environmental report in 1999. The 
</p>
<p>aim was to provide the business units and production sites with the tools to record 
</p>
<p>and manage environmental performance. The system contained three management 
</p>
<p>levels that could be attained:
</p>
<p> 1. Basic level or compliance level: The main goal is to achieve compliance with 
</p>
<p>regulatory and specific permit requirements;
</p>
<p> 2. Medium level or ISO 14001 certifiable: In addition to the basic level, focuses on 
</p>
<p>implementing a systematic management system to promote continuous improve-
</p>
<p>ment of environmental performance;
</p>
<p> 3. High level or business excellence level: In addition to the medium level, the key 
</p>
<p>goals are the implementation of an EFQM (European Foundation for Quality 
</p>
<p>Management) model and the introduction of a benchmarking with internal and 
</p>
<p>external partners.
</p>
<p>The management and reporting systems were subject to the same type of testing 
</p>
<p>and learning as found in the development of the closed loop approach to business. 
</p>
<p>At this stage the reporting system was restricted to Umicore&rsquo;s business units or 
</p>
<p>wholly-owned industrial sites within the European Union. Sites were requested to 
</p>
<p>formulate objectives, state which environmental management level they were aim-
</p>
<p>ing for and when it would likely be achieved. These decisions were left to the busi-
</p>
<p>ness unit or the site management to determine.
</p>
<p>A structured, standardize method was laid down at the central level in order to 
</p>
<p>enable consistent reporting of each site&rsquo;s operational environmental performance. 
</p>
<p>This enabled the company to provide an overall, transparent and structured assess-
</p>
<p>ment of the Union Mini&egrave;re&rsquo;s Group&rsquo;s environmental performance. This was accom-
</p>
<p>panied by a set of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs) that were divided 
</p>
<p>N. Roome and V. Jadot</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>533
</p>
<p>in five groups: input indicators, output indicators, environmental performance man-
</p>
<p>agement indicators, societal indicators, and financial indicators. This procedure was 
</p>
<p>developed to prepare the company for the introduction of a more general approach 
</p>
<p>to the implementation of management systems.
</p>
<p>The development of the management system meant an environment section 
</p>
<p>could be included in the 1998 annual report. This described the Company Charter 
</p>
<p>and the ISO 14001 certification that applied to the Union Mini&egrave;re plants. It led to the 
</p>
<p>first stand-alone environmental report published in 2000 related to fiscal year 1999. 
</p>
<p>Through this means the company began to increase the openness of its relationships 
</p>
<p>with governments, non-governmental organizations, financial stakeholders, the 
</p>
<p>community and the media; and inside the company, to provide the foundation for a 
</p>
<p>coherent management system, based on a set of measurable environmental perfor-
</p>
<p>mance indicators. This made clear to all employees that the environmental perfor-
</p>
<p>mance of the company would be taken seriously and any failure would be public.
</p>
<p>The company then set out three major obligations and cornerstones that would 
</p>
<p>underpin its environment policy. These were:
</p>
<p> 1. Regarding the past: to find practical solutions to the issues of historic soil and 
</p>
<p>groundwater pollution, resulting from long industrial history;
</p>
<p> 2. Regarding the present: to improve production process in terms of emissions and 
</p>
<p>waste management;
</p>
<p> 3. Regarding the future: to develop products that are not only environmentally safe 
</p>
<p>but also &ldquo;ahead of the time&rdquo; by full collaboration and partnership with 
</p>
<p>customers.
</p>
<p>All plants&nbsp;&ndash; inside the European Union&nbsp;&ndash; were required to meet the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>environmental standards, as well as those established by law. In some cases, Union 
</p>
<p>Mini&egrave;re&rsquo;s own requirements were more stringent than current regulations. The 
</p>
<p>report was verified by the company ERM-CVS7.
</p>
<p>Highlights of the first environmental report were that metals emissions into the 
</p>
<p>atmosphere and water had halved over the past 5&nbsp;years and that Union Mini&egrave;re had 
</p>
<p>increased the proportion of recycled products in its total feedstock. At the time, 
</p>
<p>recycled products accounted for 28% of total raw materials, which was already a 
</p>
<p>higher percentage than normal for the sector as a whole.
</p>
<p>At this time Union Mini&egrave;re began to adapt its &ldquo;corporate vocabulary&rdquo; so that it 
</p>
<p>was better aligned with the new vision it had begun to conceptualize. In its Annual 
</p>
<p>Report 1999, the company stated: &ldquo;We believe that successful companies get things 
</p>
<p>right for their customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and communities. 
</p>
<p>Financial health not only depends on extracting value, but also on creating value for 
</p>
<p>all the stakeholders. Sustainability driven companies achieve their business goals by 
</p>
<p>integrating economic, environmental and social growth opportunities into their 
</p>
<p>business strategies.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The company continued to promote the importance of working with employees 
</p>
<p>on organizational change and supported this with their first employee survey. This 
</p>
<p>survey has subsequently been repeated every 3&nbsp;years. The company also sought out

<p>7 ERM Certification and Verification Services (ERM CVS) is the worldwide envi-
</p>
<p>ronment, health and safety certification and verification business of the ERM Group, 
</p>
<p>one of the world&rsquo;s largest providers of professional EHS services.
</p>
<p>innovative ideas and in 1998 a Venture Unit was launched to create a nurturing 
</p>
<p>environment to develop and test new ideas until they were ready to be absorbed by 
</p>
<p>one of the existing business units or to provide the basis for a new business unit.
</p>
<p>The Venture Unit acted as an incubator for ideas for products and product 
</p>
<p>application.
</p>
<p>During the testing and learning phase, the initial scope of the portfolio was 
</p>
<p>restricted to ideas coming from inside the Group, in particular from the Advanced 
</p>
<p>Materials business group. Although the company invested in some other start-ups 
</p>
<p>by means of venture capital funds to create businesses or to give the chance to test 
</p>
<p>new businesses. The final step in this testing and learning period was the creation of 
</p>
<p>a new slogan for the company in 1999. That year, a new communications director 
</p>
<p>was appointed, Moniek Delvou. She had a proven track record in the area of com-
</p>
<p>munications. One of the first things achieved after joining Umicore in 1999 was a 
</p>
<p>change in the slogan of the company. Up to that time Union Mini&egrave;re&rsquo;s slogan was 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of metals and men&rdquo; and its logo consisted of five men in different metals.
</p>
<p>The new communication director noted that the logo and slogan did not describe 
</p>
<p>what the company was now doing. She believed it would be better to have a slogan 
</p>
<p>explaining putting the company and its products into context. One day, when sitting 
</p>
<p>in Thomas Leysen&rsquo;s office the idea came forward of &ldquo;Materials for a better life&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>The slogan for the company was changed from one day to another. Although the 
</p>
<p>company continued to use its old slogan externally it was rolled-out in a meeting 
</p>
<p>with senior executives without complaint. In fact there were no reactions, either 
</p>
<p>positive or negative.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Materials for a better life&rdquo; was then communicated to the outside world signal-
</p>
<p>ling the completion of the ambitious repositioning of the company that was initiated 
</p>
<p>in 1995. As recognition for its growing commitment to sustainable development and 
</p>
<p>the incorporation of responsible economic, environmental and social behaviour into 
</p>
<p>its business strategy, Union Mini&egrave;re was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
</p>
<p>Group Index in 2000. This Index claims to track the performance of the top 10% 
</p>
<p>leading sustainability-driven companies worldwide.
</p>
<p> Implementation and&nbsp;Roll-Out of&nbsp;Strategy
</p>
<p>By June 2000, Union Mini&egrave;re was beginning to be recognized as a different com-
</p>
<p>pany but it had not yet fully completed the process of change. It was now financially 
</p>
<p>sound and it had tested the new concepts that might link its future economic and 
</p>
<p>environmental performance, it had promoted employee engagement and innovation. 
</p>
<p>It had put a management and reporting system in place. It was now time to scale-up 
</p>
<p>and implement that approach on a company-wide basis.
</p>
<p>Karel Vinck felt that it was time to stand down as CEO.&nbsp;He also believed that a 
</p>
<p>CEO shouldn&rsquo;t stay more than 8&ndash;10&nbsp;years at the top of a company for three reasons: 
</p>
<p>N. Roome and V. Jadot</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>535
</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, the business environment is changing and as a leader, you never adapt 
</p>
<p>the way you should to this changing environment and its new challenges. Second, 
</p>
<p>after 8 to 10&nbsp;years you start to react and take decisions instinctively. Third, you get 
</p>
<p>emotionally involved with the workers.&rdquo; His designated replacement as CEO was 
</p>
<p>Thomas Leysen while he would become Chairman of the company. In addition to 
</p>
<p>his key role in developing and testing the new concepts &ndash; closed loop materials with 
</p>
<p>clean technology applications &ndash; Thomas Leysen had been in charge of the strategy 
</p>
<p>department and the copper and precious metals business group. This gave him the 
</p>
<p>necessary credibility to become the CEO of the company at the age of 39.
</p>
<p>Thomas Leysen was confident in taking this role and setting the direction for the 
</p>
<p>company. When he became CEO, he decided to change the name of the company to 
</p>
<p>communicate its new vision and the new approach to business more clearly. Union 
</p>
<p>Mini&egrave;re wanted to develop its approach to the environment and to create an excel-
</p>
<p>lent working environment for employees especially including health and safety. In 
</p>
<p>the case of the environment this was still seen in terms of three responsibilities: past, 
</p>
<p>present and future. But these three axes of responsibility were slightly adapted: the 
</p>
<p>past now meant coming clean over the historical pollution problems caused by the 
</p>
<p>company, the present axis represented continuous improvement of its environmen-
</p>
<p>tal performance, and the future axis focused on the precious metals and internation-
</p>
<p>alization. Special attention was given to improving the communication of these 
</p>
<p>pillars to the outside world. And matching that communication to action.
</p>
<p>Moniek Delvou, the communications director who had already triggered the 
</p>
<p>change of the slogan, received a mandate from the Board to change the name of the 
</p>
<p>company, as it was the moment to signal Union Mini&egrave;re&rsquo;s new direction and iden-
</p>
<p>tity. Research on the opinions of employees, journalists, politicians, analysts and 
</p>
<p>members of the general public came to the view that the name &lsquo;Union Mini&egrave;re&rsquo; was 
</p>
<p>associated with heavy industry and a colonial past. More positively it was associ-
</p>
<p>ated with the competences of its engineers. It was decided to change the name while 
</p>
<p>at the same time keeping a reminder of the old name.
</p>
<p>Employees and others were invited to suggest names. Some 2000 suggestions 
</p>
<p>were received. The names were reviewed by a small team presided over by Thomas 
</p>
<p>Leysen leading to the choice of &ldquo;Umicore&rdquo;. The selection filters were based on the 
</p>
<p>link with the past, linguistic meaning, legality and Internet availability and the 
</p>
<p>future. &ldquo;The reason why we took finally Umicore was because of the core. It was 
</p>
<p>unique: there was Union Mini&egrave;re&nbsp;&ndash; Umi was still there, and the &lsquo;core&rsquo; meant that we 
</p>
<p>wanted to go back to the core.&rdquo; explains Moniek Delvou. Beyond that the metals and 
</p>
<p>materials created by Umicore were seen to be at the core of products essential to 
</p>
<p>everyday life with new high technology applications. The company&rsquo;s commitment 
</p>
<p>to contribute to sustainable development, was as a pioneer in recycling and environ-
</p>
<p>mentally responsible products and processes, with environmental sector applica-
</p>
<p>tions. The consonant-vowel structure made it easy to pronounce in many of the 
</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s languages.
</p>
<p>Umicore also developed a new logo to go with the new name. It was based on the 
</p>
<p>image of recycling, with the world also represented in the logo, through the blue sky 
</p>
<p>and the green grass. The primary colours&nbsp;&ndash; blue and green&nbsp;&ndash; reflect the natural world

</p>
<p>creating the link with sustainable development. Figure&nbsp; 24.5 represents the new 
</p>
<p>name, slogan and logo. Figure&nbsp;24.6 shows the logo and a slogan.
</p>
<p>However, those leading the transformation knew that a new name and logo were 
</p>
<p>not sufficient to bring about wholesale change in the company, they merely rein-
</p>
<p>forced the direction of change. Delivering on the new vision would require pro-
</p>
<p>found change in the way employees and others saw the company. So from 2000&ndash;2005 
</p>
<p>Umicore focused on change that emphasized employees and the environment.
</p>
<p>Umicore repeated the employee survey in 2001. With a 70% employee participa-
</p>
<p>tion the survey showed there were clear improvements in 11 out of the 15 reporting 
</p>
<p>categories compared with the 1998 survey. Organizing this survey on a regular basis 
</p>
<p>brought the company closer to its stated ambition of involving people more closely 
</p>
<p>in their work and workplace by communicating openly and frequently and by giving 
</p>
<p>everyone a say in how their work is organized.
</p>
<p>Great significance was attached to employees&rsquo; views on health and safety and on 
</p>
<p>health and safety programs and performance. Figure&nbsp;24.7 show the progress in fre-
</p>
<p>quency and severity rates of the injuries in Umicore. Both have decreased signifi-
</p>
<p>cantly over the analysed period.
</p>
<p>Umicore was now in a position to address its commitment to resolve its environ-
</p>
<p>mental legacy and to shape the future. Umicore proceeded to two site remediation 
</p>
<p>programs to resolve issues from the past: first, a clean-up of a smaller plant in 
</p>
<p>Bulgaria, and second, the signing of an agreement with the OVAM for the clean-up 
</p>
<p>of all of its plants in Flanders.
</p>
<p>Umicore&rsquo;s internationalization strategy led it to acquire plants outside Belgium. 
</p>
<p>It bought a plant at Pirdop, Bulgaria with a commitment to remediate the historical 
</p>
<p>pollution created by the previous owner. US$25 million was spent in 2003 on the 
</p>
<p>remediation of the significant pollution. This was undertaken by the company in 
</p>
<p>collaboration with the World Bank and the Bulgarian authorities. This innovative

</p>
<p>collaboration gained recognition, not only in Bulgaria but also abroad. It received 
</p>
<p>the Belgian Environmental Prize 2003&ndash;2004&nbsp;in the category &ldquo;international partner-
</p>
<p>ship for sustainable development&rdquo; from the Belgian Minister of Environment.
</p>
<p>In April 2004, Umicore then signed an agreement with the Flemish Government 
</p>
<p>and the Flemish Waste Authority (OVAM) to address all remaining issues following 
</p>
<p>the 1997 Agreement over Umicore&rsquo;s plants in Flanders. This agreement covered the 
</p>
<p>remediation of soil and groundwater contamination in and around Umicore&rsquo;s main 
</p>
<p>Flemish sites: Balen, Hoboken, Olen and Overpelt. In signing this agreement, 
</p>
<p>Umicore not only sought to tackle its historical environmental legacy but also to 
</p>
<p>demonstrate its commitment towards the local community.
</p>
<p>This agreement complemented the 1997 agreement and contained three major 
</p>
<p>parts:
</p>
<p> 1. Concrete guidance for the remediation of the Umicore sites and the immediate 
</p>
<p>surroundings;
</p>
<p> 2. Remediation of the wider surroundings (a radius of 9&nbsp;km of each of the four main 
</p>
<p>Flemish plants);
</p>
<p> 3. Smooth procedures for the transfer of remediated land.
</p>
<p>While the agreement covered a period of 15&nbsp;years, Umicore stated that it was its 
</p>
<p>ambition to carry out most of the remediation within the next 3&nbsp;years.
</p>
<p>The total budget agreed by Umicore was &euro;77 million, from which &euro;39 million 
</p>
<p>were dedicated for the remediation of its plants and the surrounding residential 
</p>
<p>areas over the coming 15&nbsp; years, with a further &euro;23 million to be spent to cover 
</p>
<p>related operating costs. Additionally, a joint fund with the Flemish authorities was 
</p>
<p>created, to which each party contributed &euro;15 million over a period of 10&nbsp;years, to be 
</p>
<p>used to address identified risks in the areas outside the plants. The agreement with 
</p>
<p>OVAM had no immediate impact on Umicore&rsquo;s financial results for the period, as 
</p>
<p>provisions had been built up in the financial statements of previous years.
</p>
<p>In the same period beginning Umicore committed to eight environmental objec-
</p>
<p>tives that were to be achieved by the end of 2005. These were linked to the

</p>
<p>Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs) developed during the testing and learn-
</p>
<p>ing phase (1998&ndash;2000). By 2005, Umicore had registered an increase of the input of 
</p>
<p>secondary (recycled) materials to more than 30%, a reduction of use of water of 20% 
</p>
<p>and a reduction of emissions of metals from process sources by 50%. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>the limits on CO2 emissions imposed by international legislation was met and ISO 
</p>
<p>14001 certificates were obtained in the majority of the operational sites.
</p>
<p>Although there were no direct rewards for plants that complied with the EPIs, the 
</p>
<p>system works because site performance is published and the performance system 
</p>
<p>was linked to objectives that follow from the company&rsquo;s values. Umicore also com-
</p>
<p>mitted to benchmark itself, through the employee survey, and to be in line with the 
</p>
<p>Global Chemical Industry and Global High Performance Norm&nbsp; &ndash; a selection of 
</p>
<p>companies combining good business performance and sound people management 
</p>
<p>practice.
</p>
<p>This phase was completed by the launch of two new projects in 2005: &lsquo;Umicare&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>and a Suppliers&rsquo; Code of Conduct. &lsquo;Umicare&rsquo; encouraged business units to engage 
</p>
<p>in projects, which benefited their local communities. The Code of Conduct for 
</p>
<p>Suppliers detailed Umicore&rsquo;s expectations from its suppliers in areas such as behav-
</p>
<p>iour, environmental approach, employment or child labour. It states that the com-
</p>
<p>pany seek business partners whose policies regarding ethical, social and 
</p>
<p>environmental issues are consistent with these of held by Umicore. Special attention 
</p>
<p>was paid to mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The internal audit 
</p>
<p>team of Umicore conducts regular supplier audits in the DRC and Umicore commit-
</p>
<p>ted to halt business with any company which was not able to demonstrate compli-
</p>
<p>ance with the code. Indeed companies have been removed from Umicore&rsquo;s supplier 
</p>
<p>list as a result of this audit process. In the case of minor infractions a plan to help 
</p>
<p>improve the supplier&rsquo;s operational practices can be agreed and followed-up. 
</p>
<p>Umicore involved a number of NGOs and other external parties in formulating this 
</p>
<p>approach.
</p>
<p>The financial situation for Umicore was favourable when Thomas Leysen took 
</p>
<p>over as CEO.&nbsp;The net result for 2000 of &euro;136 million was almost twice the result of 
</p>
<p>1999. This resulted from a favourable dollar exchange rate and by the price of some 
</p>
<p>metals, such as zinc as well as progress made in the transformation of the business. 
</p>
<p>The divisions specializing in zinc, precious metals and specialty materials had 
</p>
<p>impressive results. Thomas Leysen saw this as the moment to continue to change 
</p>
<p>the orientation of the group towards products with higher value added, that provided 
</p>
<p>solutions for the future. While the 1995&ndash;1998 Industrial Plan prioritized the refining 
</p>
<p>activities. From 2000 on, part of the new investments would be dedicated to more 
</p>
<p>sophisticated products.
</p>
<p>In particular Umicore sought to consolidate its leadership in the recycling sector 
</p>
<p>and to translate its expertise in recycling in the &ldquo;precious metal&rdquo; business unit to 
</p>
<p>other business units dealing with advanced materials. This approach led to growth 
</p>
<p>of the company through the organic growth that arose from the internal exchange of 
</p>
<p>ideas between business units and through acquisitions in the area of advanced 
</p>
<p>materials.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Organic growth was pursued through increased R&amp;D spending. A Venture Unit 
</p>
<p>was created dedicated to foster innovation around materials recycling and applica-
</p>
<p>tions. A new initiative &lsquo;Umagine&rsquo; was launched to run in parallel to the Venture 
</p>
<p>Unit. At the same time Umicore increased its R&amp;D spend and sought to establish a 
</p>
<p>more embedded innovation culture that stood outside a central R&amp;D facility.
</p>
<p>Figure 24.8 shows that during the period 2001&ndash;2005, R&amp;D spending doubled 
</p>
<p>from 3% of the revenue to almost 6%. At this time the central R&amp;D portfolio con-
</p>
<p>sisted of two groups of projects:
</p>
<p> &ndash; 70% of the total R&amp;D budget was used to support the business plans of the indi-
</p>
<p>vidual business units. In these business plans economic performance and sustain-
</p>
<p>ability were important topics. The greater part of Umicore&rsquo;s long-term research 
</p>
<p>budget was directed towards ways the company could contribute to renewable 
</p>
<p>energy solutions such as fuel cells and solar cells.
</p>
<p> &ndash; 30% (the remainder of the R&amp;D spend was centrally managed and primarily 
</p>
<p>meant to support Umagine initiatives.
</p>
<p>Umagine was designed to stimulate and foster innovation in Umicore from the 
</p>
<p>bottom up, and in that way complementing the Venture Unit. People from different 
</p>
<p>businesses of Umicore, were encouraged to work together with outside participants 
</p>
<p>by interacting in &lsquo;ideas labs&rsquo; around selected themes such as recycling and nano- 
</p>
<p>technology. These highly interactive processes generated a wealth of ideas that were 
</p>
<p>checked against criteria in line with Umicore&rsquo;s overall strategy. These included 
</p>
<p>parameters such as their business potential and sustainability. Gradually, Umagine 
</p>
<p>and the Venture Unit became less needed as the company as a whole adopted a cul-
</p>
<p>ture of innovation based on a team approach to the generation and testing of ideas. 
</p>
<p>Thomas Leysen sought to stimulate this approach by opening up the company to 
</p>
<p>ideas exchanged among colleagues, across the company and across it boundary. In 
</p>
<p>this way the company culture evolved from a culture of &lsquo;doing and complying&rsquo; to a 
</p>
<p>culture of &lsquo;learning and innovating&rsquo; where all employees were invited to 
</p>
<p>participate.

</p>
<p>The company also sought to consolidate its new approach through acquisitions 
</p>
<p>and mergers. In July 2003 Umicore bought the &ldquo;Precious Metals Group&rdquo; (PMG), a 
</p>
<p>subsidiary of the American company OMG for &euro;643 million. It was the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>largest acquisition until then.
</p>
<p>PMG contributed new applications in the area of precious metals. It was an 
</p>
<p>important producer of automobile catalysts and of a whole series of materials based 
</p>
<p>on precious metals. It fitted well with Umicore&rsquo;s slogan of &lsquo;Materials for a better 
</p>
<p>life&rsquo;. Through the addition of PMG, Umicore mastered the entire life cycle of pre-
</p>
<p>cious metals: collecting and pre-processing of recyclable waste, in particular of 
</p>
<p>used automobile catalysts, refining end-of-life products and secondary industrial 
</p>
<p>materials (resulting from foundry operations and refining of other metals), and fab-
</p>
<p>rication of products designed for new uses. The acquisition of PMG also strength-
</p>
<p>ened Umicore&rsquo;s geographic presence in North and South America.
</p>
<p>The integration process of PMG was a success. But the most difficult part of the 
</p>
<p>acquisition was reconfiguring precious metal refining because of the overlap 
</p>
<p>between refining at Umicore plant at Hoboken and the Hanau plant of PM.&nbsp;As the 
</p>
<p>plant of Hoboken had the most advanced technology in the world for recycling, it 
</p>
<p>was decided that the plant in Hoboken would undertake all the refining activities, 
</p>
<p>whereas the plant in Hanau would concentrate on the other activities of the precious 
</p>
<p>metals business unit. Integration of PMG significantly increased Umicore&rsquo;s scien-
</p>
<p>tific knowledge and its applied technological know-how, with more than 500 people 
</p>
<p>then active in this area.
</p>
<p>From 2003 on, the copper business was organized in such a way that it could 
</p>
<p>function as a stand-alone company. Umicore prepared this division for sale. In 2005, 
</p>
<p>the copper operations were spun off into a new company, Cumerio, to enable 
</p>
<p>Umicore to move ahead more swiftly in its evolution as a specialty materials busi-
</p>
<p>ness. Three plants were concerned: Olen (Belgium), Avellino (Italy) and Pirdop 
</p>
<p>(Bulgaria).
</p>
<p>By 2005, Umicore also decided to concentrate the strategic focus of its zinc divi-
</p>
<p>sion on the production and sale of zinc specialty products. This strategy reduced the 
</p>
<p>output of commodity zinc and concentrated on the development of downstream zinc 
</p>
<p>specialties activities.
</p>
<p>Umicore paid special attention to its employees as part of its sustainable strategy, 
</p>
<p>and hence established a new Human Resources Management Organization in line 
</p>
<p>with the operational and cultural needs of the new Group in September 2003. 
</p>
<p>Responsibilities for HR now largely rest with the HR functions at country or regional 
</p>
<p>level while the corporate HR function guided the overall policy formulation, man-
</p>
<p>agement development and HR networking.
</p>
<p>All these changes in the business were supported by more transparent external 
</p>
<p>communication, replacing Union Mini&egrave;re&rsquo;s previous lack of transparency. But to do 
</p>
<p>this the new Umicore had to develop its expertise and gear up the range of commu-
</p>
<p>nication tools through continuous improvement. These included: the environment 
</p>
<p>report, local site reports, press releases, open-door days and improved websites.
</p>
<p>The environment report of 2000 was extended to include health and safety issues. 
</p>
<p>It was re-named the &ldquo;Environment and Safety&rdquo; report with the tagline: &ldquo;On the 
</p>
<p>N. Roome and V. Jadot</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Road to Sustainable Development&rdquo;. It contained three major parts: the group&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>objectives for the period 2000&ndash;2005, occupational health and safety data and finan-
</p>
<p>cial data. It outlined that
</p>
<p>We do not just want to create value only for our shareholders, employees and customers but 
we also want to create value for society as a whole. We endeavour to achieve this by operat-
ing in an environmentally responsible manner and by delivering materials and services that 
are essential both for everyday life as well as for technological progress. (Umicore Annual 
Report 2010)
</p>
<p>The Environment and Safety Report of 2001 extensively described Umicore&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>product safety philosophy. It included a sound scientific approach to assess the haz-
</p>
<p>ards and the risks in using Umicore&rsquo;s products. By then the tagline &ldquo;Responsible 
</p>
<p>towards future generations&rdquo; indicated Umicore was comfortable to communicate 
</p>
<p>the approach to sustainability it was developing and the report was expanded in 
</p>
<p>breadth as well as depth. All the company&rsquo;s sites reported on their performance in a 
</p>
<p>report based on three main sections: the Environment, Health and Safety manage-
</p>
<p>ment at all sites, the company&rsquo;s responsible management of its historical legacy and 
</p>
<p>responsible product management. The report was awarded the best environment 
</p>
<p>report in Belgium by the Belgian Institute of Chartered Accountants.
</p>
<p>EHS management for all sites was regulated by the new Umicore Health and 
</p>
<p>Safety Care System, based on three performance levels:
</p>
<p> &ndash; Basic level: The baseline level to be attained in every plant;
</p>
<p> &ndash; Medium level: Compliance with EU Directives on control of major accidents 
</p>
<p>(Seveso Directive or international equivalent);
</p>
<p> &ndash; Business Excellence: The ultimate goal for all operations, which included all 
</p>
<p>aspects of excellent health and safety management.
</p>
<p>Umicore continued to develop its communication on environmental matters, 
</p>
<p>through the medium of a community relations website, part of its community 
</p>
<p>involvement program. The company was also proud to communicate that its 
</p>
<p>Environment and Safety report was elected the best in Belgium by the &ldquo;Reviseurs 
</p>
<p>d&rsquo;Entreprises/Instituut der Bedrijfsrevisoren&rdquo;. At the same time the Belgian asso-
</p>
<p>ciation of financial analysts awarded Umicore the prize for best financial communi-
</p>
<p>cation in 2002. The company was also included in the FTSE4GOOD index and 
</p>
<p>received the &lsquo;best in class&rsquo; rating from the Storebrand Social Responsibility Index.
</p>
<p>In 2003, the Environment and Safety report became &ldquo;Environment, Health and 
</p>
<p>Safety report&rdquo; with the tagline &ldquo;Environment, health &amp; safety and business growth 
</p>
<p>go hand in hand&rdquo;. Year after year, the company was enlarging its scope of reporting 
</p>
<p>and now paid more attention to the employees by including health issues. That same 
</p>
<p>year, Umicore was selected for membership of the new Kempen/SNS Smaller 
</p>
<p>Europe Social Responsibility Index.
</p>
<p>The company then published &ldquo;The Umicore Way&rdquo;, a framework of guiding prin-
</p>
<p>ciples and a statement of what was common and essential for the Group. The 
</p>
<p>Umicore Way explains the vision of the Group and the values it seeks to promote. It 
</p>
<p>24 A Case of&nbsp;Radical Reinvention: Umicore</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>542
</p>
<p>serves as a reference point for all employees. The Umicore Way was introduced by 
</p>
<p>means of an extensive roadshow carried out by Umicore&rsquo;s senior management 
</p>
<p>which visited seven locations in four continents.
</p>
<p>The adoption of a Code of Conduct for all Umicore employees followed the 
</p>
<p>declaration of the Umicore Way. It provided a statement of ethical business prac-
</p>
<p>tices throughout Umicore. It was distributed throughout the group and has been 
</p>
<p>translated into four languages. By 2005 the continuous improvements in perfor-
</p>
<p>mance, management systems and participation by sites led to the publication of one 
</p>
<p>single annual report, including economic, environmental and social sections. The 
</p>
<p>audience was enlarged: as it was recognized that the scope of people entitled to 
</p>
<p>information about how Umicore did business went beyond the boundaries of the 
</p>
<p>investment community and the report was therefore addressed to &ldquo;Shareholders and 
</p>
<p>Society&rdquo;. Furthermore, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines were 
</p>
<p>adopted, as a standard. This Annual Report begins to reflect Umicore&rsquo;s approach to 
</p>
<p>sustainable development.
</p>
<p>The work on reporting was supported by publishing reports for the local com-
</p>
<p>munity (which included the families of many employees of the plants) coupled to an 
</p>
<p>open doors approach at the plants in Hoboken and Olen and in the corporate head-
</p>
<p>quarters in Brussels each year.
</p>
<p>By the end of 2005, the majority of earnings derived by Umicore were from areas 
</p>
<p>in which the company held global leadership positions and where it could rely on its 
</p>
<p>distinctive technological capabilities. At the same time, the concept of sustainable 
</p>
<p>development had become firmly embedded in the strategic thinking, and was nota-
</p>
<p>bly exemplified by its commitment to closed loop manufacturing and recycling. In 
</p>
<p>that year Umicore was elected 42nd worldwide for combined financial and CSR 
</p>
<p>performance by Newsweek Japan.
</p>
<p> Diffusion and&nbsp;Institutionalization
</p>
<p>Umicore&rsquo;s approach to sustainability that started in the cobalt and precious metals 
</p>
<p>business unit at the end of the 1990s was then implemented on a wider scale in the 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s operations in Belgium 2000s. From 2005, Umicore went further taking 
</p>
<p>the ideas developed in Belgium to all its plants and to the companies it had acquired. 
</p>
<p>Employee engagement was also extended to sites outside Belgium and the European 
</p>
<p>Union.
</p>
<p>We can say that over the last few years we have moved ahead on many fronts: in tackling 
the legacy of past activities, in ensuring that the environmental performance of our present 
processes are in line with ever more demanding standards, and&nbsp;&ndash; most importantly&nbsp;&ndash; by 
contributing to a better environment through the development of innovative products and a 
commitment to recycling. For the future, we will progress on this Umicore Way. (Thomas 
Leysen, Umicore EHS Report 2004)
</p>
<p>The eight environmental objectives for the period to 2005 were complemented 
</p>
<p>by five new objectives on the social front again to be realized over a period of

</p>
<p>5&nbsp;years. In this way, importance was given to the relationship of the company to 
</p>
<p>society as well as the environment&nbsp;&ndash; with a focus on employees and local commu-
</p>
<p>nity. At the same time the three environmental axes were extended and disseminated 
</p>
<p>on a global basis.
</p>
<p>Cleaning up the past was extended to rehabilitation in other sites, such as the 
</p>
<p>plant in Gr&acirc;ce-Hollogne (Walloon region of Belgium). Continuous improvement in 
</p>
<p>the present was brought about by the addition of new objectives and their applica-
</p>
<p>tion across the company as a whole. As for the future, the vision of the company, in 
</p>
<p>terms of closing material loops with material applications in environmental and 
</p>
<p>clean technology markets was further elaborated. Figure&nbsp;24.9 shows that Umicore 
</p>
<p>continued to invest in R&amp;D (with 80% in the area of clean technology). 
</p>
<p>Simultaneously, acquisitions and divestitures radically changed the portfolio of its 
</p>
<p>businesses. In 2007 Umicore further divested its zinc business into a new company 
</p>
<p>(Nyrstar) and bought the automotive catalyst business of Delphi Group. These and 
</p>
<p>other acquisitions contribute to a reinforcement of the core business.
</p>
<p>During this phase Umicore continuously refined its communication, through its 
</p>
<p>annual reports. For example Umicore applied the principles of the Global Reporting 
</p>
<p>Initiative (GRI) to its reporting framework since the publication of the 2005 Report 
</p>
<p>to Shareholders and Society.
</p>
<p>Overall Umicore built on the lessons learnt in Belgium and then in wider Europe 
</p>
<p>to effect organizational transformation in its other sites around the World. This fol-
</p>
<p>lowed the main themes of its overall approach employee engagement through sur-
</p>
<p>veys and support for innovation, fostering quality employment and health and safety 
</p>
<p>of the employees and engagement with local communities around its sites, in case 
</p>
<p>of the environment &ndash; cleaning up the past, continuous improvement of operations 
</p>
<p>and a focus on precious metals and internationalization with this all supporting a 
</p>
<p>business moving toward materials based on closed-loop systems with environmen-
</p>
<p>tal and clean technology applications.

</p>
<p> Discussion
</p>
<p>The case narrative above states the main phases in the transformation of Umicore 
</p>
<p>over 19&nbsp;years. It follows what happened chronologically, as reported by the key 
</p>
<p>informants. It identifies the overall process into five phases, the key elements and 
</p>
<p>sequences of that transition and the role played by senior managers. In this way the 
</p>
<p>case provides insight into the roles and beliefs of those leading the transformation 
</p>
<p>process. In this discussion section we draw on theory to make some sense of the 
</p>
<p>process that is described and the role of human agents in that change process.
</p>
<p>The literature identifies the central role of change agents in transformation to 
</p>
<p>sustainable development but without going in to great detail as to what the role of 
</p>
<p>change agents involves (Dunphy et&nbsp;al. 2007; Mayon-White 2003; Beckhard 1997). 
</p>
<p>Despite the emerging complexity of change agency in relation to sustainable devel-
</p>
<p>opment and its implications for business few attempts have been made to clearly 
</p>
<p>define a process model and to reveal the factors that contribute to change. What is 
</p>
<p>clear is that change agents are recognised as individuals or teams that initiate, lead, 
</p>
<p>direct or take direct responsibility for making change happen (Caldwell 2003). A 
</p>
<p>change agent can be considered as an agenda-setter, language-creator and modera-
</p>
<p>tor (Cramer et&nbsp;al. 2004). It has been argued that his/her changing personal values 
</p>
<p>drive the process of organizational change (Hemingway and Maclagan 2004).
</p>
<p>However change agents in the case of organizational transformation toward sus-
</p>
<p>tainable development have received less consideration as there are rather fewer 
</p>
<p>close empirical studies of this process although authors have noted the importance 
</p>
<p>of leaders in triggering change (Neilson et&nbsp;al. 2008; Spitzeck 2009; Gitsham 2008) 
</p>
<p>Moreover it is also noted that those driving change are found primarily within the 
</p>
<p>organization and express their ideas through the company&rsquo;s various implementation 
</p>
<p>strategies (Jonker and de Witte 2010). It has been suggested that the leadership nec-
</p>
<p>essary for organizational change that contributes to sustainable development is 
</p>
<p>based on &ldquo;the global exercise of ethical, values-based leadership in the pursuit of 
</p>
<p>economic and societal progress and sustainable development&rdquo; (Globally Responsible 
</p>
<p>Leadership Initiative 2005). That view seems to be based on an understanding of the 
</p>
<p>interconnectedness of the world and an acknowledgement of the need for economic, 
</p>
<p>societal and environmental progress. However, this kind of statement only serves to 
</p>
<p>decompose and restate the qualities of sustainable development, which emphasises 
</p>
<p>linking economic, social and environmental issues in ways that provide for present 
</p>
<p>and future, so that this is reframed as a leadership challenge. It does not get very far 
</p>
<p>into the details of the critical leadership roles and beliefs or provide more compre-
</p>
<p>hensive insight into the process, especially the sequence of events that supports 
</p>
<p>successful transformation for sustainable development.
</p>
<p>In contrast D&rsquo;Amato and Roome (2009) in their meta-study of companies that 
</p>
<p>have engaged in transformation towards sustainable development identify eight 
</p>
<p>leadership practices that contribute to the deep change required when a company 
</p>
<p>sets about changing its activities to move from unsustainable practices and contrib-
</p>
<p>ute to sustainable development. These practices include: developing vision for the 
</p>
<p>future of the company; crafting strategy and policies that links commercial and 
</p>
<p>N. Roome and V. Jadot</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>545
</p>
<p>environmental practices; operationalization and translation of strategy and policy to 
</p>
<p>the local, operational level; ensuring top management support and involvement; 
</p>
<p>engaging with stakeholders; fostering the empowerment and development of the of 
</p>
<p>key actors; high quality communication; establishing systems for performance 
</p>
<p>development and accountability; and, demonstrable commitment to ethical actions. 
</p>
<p>Their work also points to the supporting relationship in the companies they studied 
</p>
<p>that linked a future vision for the company, with concepts that help make that vision 
</p>
<p>a reality, formal strategy to provide direction and resources, business principles that 
</p>
<p>underscore actions and the importance of key beliefs in holding this together. These 
</p>
<p>beliefs include: a recognition of problems as opportunities; only doing what you say 
</p>
<p>and saying what you do; commitment to a humanistic organizational culture that 
</p>
<p>values people, recognises that everyone has the potential to contribute ideas that 
</p>
<p>support change and that focuses on learning, innovation and change before it 
</p>
<p>focused on control. Moreover this research emphasises that successful transitions 
</p>
<p>involve people and groups that fulfil certain roles that bring about this sequence: the 
</p>
<p>role of creating vision; generating concepts relevant to the change; championing 
</p>
<p>those concepts through organizational networks; creating communities of practice 
</p>
<p>that explore, test and translate those concepts into actions and new practices. This is 
</p>
<p>supported first by communicators and then by the role of those who develop and 
</p>
<p>deploy management systems.
</p>
<p>The case of Umicore appears to corroborate the importance of these eight prac-
</p>
<p>tices as well as providing some indication of the sequence through which the ele-
</p>
<p>ments of the process are deployed, especially the link between vision, concepts, 
</p>
<p>strategy and business principles.
</p>
<p>The process at Umicore was as follows. Senior managers became aware of its 
</p>
<p>pressing financial and environmental problems and sought a way out. The industrial 
</p>
<p>plan provided an immediate a way out of the financial situation faced by the com-
</p>
<p>pany but did not provide a longer term solution that would resolve the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>environmental problems. It was nevertheless understood that past environmental 
</p>
<p>problems had to be resolved and new problems avoided. That required a leap of 
</p>
<p>imagination that translated environmental problems into economic opportunities. It 
</p>
<p>involved an emerging vision for the company that arose from the link between two 
</p>
<p>important concepts&nbsp;&ndash; closed material loops and clean technological applications. 
</p>
<p>More hidden in the story of Umicore was a commitment to the practice of the con-
</p>
<p>cept of continuous improvement. The emerging vision shaped by these concepts 
</p>
<p>was fostered by the move toward an organizational climate that emphasized innova-
</p>
<p>tion and learning founded on the empowerment of employees: Only then to be sup-
</p>
<p>ported by a declaration of values.
</p>
<p>In this way a vision for the company developed that it would define its future as 
</p>
<p>providing material solutions to provide solutions to environmental problems while 
</p>
<p>ensuring that the company&rsquo;s operations accorded with the highest possible environ-
</p>
<p>mental standards. Moreover the company would progressively move toward a 
</p>
<p>closed loop business.
</p>
<p>The model to fulfil that vision was not immediately obvious&nbsp;&ndash; it came from test-
</p>
<p>ing and experimenting with these ideas in one business unit and then progressively 
</p>
<p>24 A Case of&nbsp;Radical Reinvention: Umicore</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>546
</p>
<p>up-scaling that experience to other parts of the company and its business. This 
</p>
<p>required the development of an awareness of the new approach among employees, 
</p>
<p>coupled to their empowerment and encouragement of their engagement in learning 
</p>
<p>and innovation to deliver the practices that would make the vision tenable. Only 
</p>
<p>once this cultural change was in place could the company press ahead with the 
</p>
<p>development of a management, performance and reporting system. The manage-
</p>
<p>ment system was gradually extended and expanded into the whole of the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion but it too followed the development of the culture of learning and innovation as 
</p>
<p>the management system itself was seen as an innovation.
</p>
<p>At Umicore there was an period of iteration between the emerging vision for the 
</p>
<p>company on the one side and concepts that would be central to that vision based on 
</p>
<p>the promotion of a more open and innovative culture, on the other.
</p>
<p>Once the vision was clear, and the concepts had been tested and seen to provide 
</p>
<p>a viable approach for the company it was able to embark on an acquisition and 
</p>
<p>divestment strategy that closed its material loop in some main business areas and 
</p>
<p>got out of areas that did not conform to the new approach. At the same time acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion of businesses provided new know-how although it created challenges of inte-
</p>
<p>grating those businesses into the culture and approach taken by Umicore.
</p>
<p>Intense communication by the CEO&rsquo;s coupled to the use of formal documents 
</p>
<p>such as reports and community liaison was seen as critical and this too was gradu-
</p>
<p>ally developed and pushed forward so that claims were in line with achievements 
</p>
<p>and words matched actions. Significant attention was given to key communica-
</p>
<p>tions&nbsp;&ndash; the logo, slogans and name of the company developed in a rhetorical way so 
</p>
<p>that it signalled change that had been made and inspired more movement in that 
</p>
<p>direction. A premium was placed on transparency and admitting to and addressing 
</p>
<p>the problems of the past.
</p>
<p>Above all the case illustrates the importance of the continuity of belief systems 
</p>
<p>of the three CEO&rsquo;s and the matching roles that supported the accomplishment of 
</p>
<p>transformation. Despite their different experiences the three CEO&rsquo;s all placed a pre-
</p>
<p>mium on human relationships, communication and matched that with a commit-
</p>
<p>ment to learning.
</p>
<p>Finally, the case indicate that senior managers at Umicore had a simple yet com-
</p>
<p>pelling understanding of the implications of sustainable development. This is not a 
</p>
<p>trivial point. Senior managers understood sustainable development as a strategic 
</p>
<p>challenge and opportunity some 15&nbsp;years ago. And they south to work out what that 
</p>
<p>would mean for change at the company. Moreover, their quest was not to claim 
</p>
<p>sustainability for the company but to acknowledge clearly that Umicore was a busi-
</p>
<p>ness seeking to create value and profit but that did not pre-determine how it would 
</p>
<p>create value. Given the company&rsquo;s history senior managers seemed to know that the 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s longer term future would be based on a choice of how they did business, 
</p>
<p>and how they chose to create value into the future. That would mean breaking with 
</p>
<p>the ways of the past that had created value while at the same time destroying envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental value. The key issue was how to identify the path for transition and to 
</p>
<p>develop the skills and know how that would make it successful.

</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s senior managers set out to determine the direction for the com-
</p>
<p>pany through the combination of vision and concepts, to encourage the commitment 
</p>
<p>and alignment of employees and others to that direction but to leave the detailed 
</p>
<p>operationalization to those closer to the operational realities of the company.
</p>
<p> Conclusions
</p>
<p>This chapter set out to examine the process of transformation undertake by Umicore 
</p>
<p>a company that is widely held to be a leader in its contribution to sustainable devel-
</p>
<p>opment. The chapter describes that process using the insights of those who were 
</p>
<p>close to the process that unfolded over 19&nbsp;years. That process is still not complete 
</p>
<p>but much has been changed.
</p>
<p>The chapter sheds light on the sequence of this process and the factors that con-
</p>
<p>tributed to the way it unfolded. It shows something of the practices that support the 
</p>
<p>process of change and the roles and beliefs that were held by change agents and 
</p>
<p>leaders. These conform to evidence from previous companies that have undertaken 
</p>
<p>similar transitions.
</p>
<p>What is clear is that Umicore held a somewhat unusually advanced yet simple 
</p>
<p>view of sustainability, a view that is rather consistent with the original understand-
</p>
<p>ing of sustainable development as set out in the Brundtland report. But the real value 
</p>
<p>of the case is in the charting of process that then unfolded: Creating a culture of 
</p>
<p>learning and innovation to provide for change. Developing a new vision for the 
</p>
<p>company that was supported by the deployment of some key concepts that were 
</p>
<p>relatively new to the company. That required learning about those concepts by 
</p>
<p>doing. In other words transformation, to make a contribution to sustainable develop-
</p>
<p>ment at Umicore, was essentially an innovation process that deploys some concepts 
</p>
<p>that were not conventional for the business and required management to subscribe 
</p>
<p>to some relatively rare skills. The fact that the transformation at Umicore involved 
</p>
<p>a simple yet advanced notion of the implications for the business of sustainable 
</p>
<p>development, deployed some unconventional concepts and drew on some rare skills 
</p>
<p>possibly explains why so few examples of successful transformations toward sus-
</p>
<p>tainable development are available to study.

<p>25IBM and&nbsp;Sustainability: Creating a&nbsp;Smarter Planet
Gilbert&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Lenssen and&nbsp;N. Craig&nbsp;Smith
</p>
<p>Sometime in 2000&ndash;2001, IBM decided that companies from emerging countries 
</p>
<p>would be much better placed to produce and market hardware and that it needed to 
</p>
<p>move up the value chain by developing and offering more technology applications 
</p>
<p>and develop the consulting capability to help clients with applications. Less focus 
</p>
<p>on technology as such, and more on the enabling potentials of technology was the 
</p>
<p>idea. As a result, it sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2004. The recent $2,1b sale of 
</p>
<p>the server business to Lenovo completed this process.
</p>
<p>In 2002, IBM acquired the consulting arm of PWC in order to buy in consulting 
</p>
<p>knowledge and capabilities, despite its previous reliance on continuous learning and 
</p>
<p>in house capability development. However, the integration of PWC consulting into 
</p>
<p>IBM was not achieved without major difficulties and took many years.1
</p>
<p>In 2008, the IBM Smarter Planet Strategy was launched in the midst of the melt-
</p>
<p>down of the financial crisis. It was a bold statement of hope in those dark days. It 
</p>
<p>asserted that the world can be a better place with the smart use of technology and 
</p>
<p>IBM would be able to provide the consulting, the software and the management 
</p>
<p>systems for addressing some of the world&rsquo;s most pressing challenges. Addressing 
</p>
<p>sustainable development was immediately one of the key objectives.
</p>
<p>1 IBM managers in Gilbert Lenssen&rsquo;s classes have testified that it took more than 10&nbsp;years to over-
come cultural differences.
</p>
<p>This chapter served as the basis for &ldquo;Finding Profit in Creating a Smarter Planet,&rdquo; published in 
INSEAD Knowledge, March 2016.</p>

<p>The vision is explained in a 2010 presentation from Rich Lechner, IBM VP 
</p>
<p>Energy and Environment, which follows.2 He is obviously is a business leader with 
</p>
<p>an acute awareness of the business potential of sustainability and a clear under-
</p>
<p>standing of the societal relevance. A clear sense of purpose around making the 
</p>
<p>planet a better place is embedded throughout the presentation.
</p>
<p>It might seem obvious or common sense, yet it has been a huge success. This is 
</p>
<p>notwithstanding the fact that companies find it generally very difficult to embark on 
</p>
<p>and succeed in major business model transformations, especially in the field of sus-
</p>
<p>tainable development where risks are high and outcomes unsure.

<p> 
</p>
<p> Smart Projects
</p>
<p>By tapping into and interconnecting with new (often global) production systems 
</p>
<p>and workforces, the Smarter Planet Strategy helps companies gain deep industry 
</p>
<p>insight, giving them the competitive advantage of being able to identify opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties not previously visible, and the capability to transform the way things are done.
</p>
<p>Along with business potential, this increased knowledge opens the way for 
</p>
<p>organisations to link sustainability to the purpose of their business, to integrate it 
</p>
<p>into their strategy and, in the process, help change the world.
</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless. According to IBM, smarter use of technology opens 
</p>
<p>the way for smarter law enforcement, smarter water and sewer systems, smarter 
</p>
<p>government services, smarter transportation and smarter operations centres.
</p>
<p>Some of the strategy&rsquo;s flagship examples include working with Stockholm city 
</p>
<p>authorities to design and implement a congestion-management system substantially 
</p>
<p>reducing traffic build-up, vehicle emissions and encouraging greater use of public 
</p>
<p>transport; and helping Syracuse University&rsquo;s Green Data Centre halve the energy 
</p>
<p>requirements of standard data centres, using advanced techniques in building design, 
</p>
<p>energy generation, cooling technology and IT systems.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile in rural Louisiana, a Smarter Planet telemedicine initiative has helped 
</p>
<p>provide advanced healthcare to patients with limited access to services, by creating 
</p>
<p>a portal allowing doctors to record and share test results and vital signs, aiming for 
</p>
<p>faster and more accurate diagnosis.3

</p>
<p>collaborative and responsive, introducing the benefits of innovation rapidly and at 
</p>
<p>scale.
</p>
<p>Smarter Planet operates as a global business. Knowledge exchange and consoli-
</p>
<p>dation of learning from each project is obviously the basis for maintaining advan-
</p>
<p>tage over competitors who might be tempted to imitate IBM.
</p>
<p> Pillar for&nbsp;Growth
</p>
<p>For IBM, the introduction of &lsquo;Smart&rsquo; solutions is a $66 billion opportunity and one 
</p>
<p>of its four key pillars for growth. Based on the vision that data integration reinforces 
</p>
<p>a united world, IBM software is the key driver for this proposition, giving clients the 
</p>
<p>capabilities required to transform their industries by integrating information, empow-
</p>
<p>ering people, connecting global ecosystems, and optimising business processes.
</p>
<p>In 2010, the Smarter Planet Strategy generated US$3 billion in revenue and it 
</p>
<p>accounted for more than 25 percent of IBM&rsquo;s research work. It is in the process of 
</p>
<p>doubling this to 50% by focusing its efforts on high-growth industries such as 
</p>
<p>healthcare; oil and gas; energy and utilities; transportation; telecommunications; 
</p>
<p>retail; banking; government; and electronics.
</p>
<p>In order to optimally manage its business IBM develops a yearly roadmap, which 
</p>
<p>includes a long&nbsp;&ndash; term perspective on technology, business and the global economy, 
</p>
<p>and seeks to align this business model with clients&rsquo; needs.
</p>
<p> Core Strengths for&nbsp;Succeeding in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Integrated World
</p>
<p>This focus on the enabling power of technology is not new to the company. IBM 
</p>
<p>played a central role in scientific breakthroughs at several stages of its history, sup-
</p>
<p>porting NASA in putting a man on the moon and assisting with the decoding of the 
</p>
<p>human genome. Seeing and solving problems has long been at the core of its opera-
</p>
<p>tions, as has the recognition that, with innovative thinking, many different types of 
</p>
<p>resource can contribute to the solution. After applying these principles to its own 
</p>
<p>operations, the company is now turning its eye to the world becoming, in essence, a 
</p>
<p>sustainability enabler, demonstrating the culture, structure and governance needed 
</p>
<p>to adapt to a globally integrated market.
</p>
<p>The philosophy that &lsquo;any problem can be solved as long as people are willing to 
</p>
<p>think&rsquo; reflects a mindset that does not accept existing boundaries while the develop-
</p>
<p>ment and subsequent sharing with the world of its advancements shows an under-
</p>
<p>standing of the value of the availability and use of common standards. The company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>refusal to adopt segregation policies for its plants in southern US states in the 1960s 
</p>
<p>and its progressive emancipation policies towards workers throughout its corporate 
</p>
<p>history, reflects its attitude of inclusion and openness. IBM believes that talented 
</p>
<p>people can be found anywhere in what they call the &lsquo;human family&rsquo;. It embraces the 
</p>
<p>fact that all people are different and it is these differences that facilitate innovation 
</p>
<p>and the ability to adapt.
</p>

</p>
<p>These values are a cultural asset of paramount importance to any company oper-
</p>
<p>ating as a globally integrated enterprise. But having the cultural capability alone is 
</p>
<p>not enough. A company&rsquo;s organisational architecture needs to look beyond the tra-
</p>
<p>ditional, and fragmented, idea of brand, process, product and country. IBM acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged this by putting in place an integrated design with a strong overall governance 
</p>
<p>model to become congruent with the realities of today&rsquo;s dynamic integrated global 
</p>
<p>economy.
</p>
<p> Addressing Challenges
</p>
<p>In 2016, the world is not short of problems, many of which have sustainability 
</p>
<p>issues at their core. The number and size of these issues trump the capability of 
</p>
<p>governments to solve them. IBM recognises the business opportunity for delivering 
</p>
<p>systems that enhance sustainability within firms and in doing so address many of 
</p>
<p>these challenges. In a world where integrated enterprises increasingly tap into global 
</p>
<p>production systems and workforces, competitive advantage comes from dynamic 
</p>
<p>learning, greater insight, and in the potential of transforming the way things are 
</p>
<p>done to keep relevant and competitive in a high-paced, rapidly changing globalised 
</p>
<p>marketplace.
</p>
<p>Critical questions IBM needs to address are:
</p>
<p> 1. IBM&rsquo;s strength has always been in technology development. This Smarter Planet 
</p>
<p>strategy shifts IBM from technology development to technology applications for 
</p>
<p>management solutions and makes it effectively a consulting company. What are 
</p>
<p>the long range organisational implications of this shift?
</p>
<p> 2. Other consulting companies like Accenture who are making major bets on sus-
</p>
<p>tainability have consulting as a key capability which they nurture, not in the least 
</p>
<p>with being in touch with senior executives through which they can anticipate the 
</p>
<p>changing executive agenda. They can consult on an entire sustainability strategy 
</p>
<p>and on specific operational solutions based on smart technology. Can IBM emu-
</p>
<p>late this approach?
</p>
<p> 3. IBM might ultimately lose its leadership in technology, nor be a leading consult-
</p>
<p>ing company. Is there enough space in between both industry sectors for it to 
</p>
<p>thrive?

<p>26Waste Concern: Fixing Market Failures
Joanna&nbsp;Radeke, Johanna&nbsp;Mair, and&nbsp;Christian&nbsp;Seelos
</p>
<p>In September 2005 Iftekhar Enayetullah and Abu Hasnat Md. Maqsood Sinha, the 
</p>
<p>founders of Waste Concern, secured approval for their first project under the Clean 
</p>
<p>Development Mechanism (CDM) program, established in the Kyoto Protocol. 
</p>
<p>Under the CDM program, projects reducing greenhouse gas emissions in countries 
</p>
<p>without emission targets could earn income from the sale of Certified Emission 
</p>
<p>Reduction units (CERs).1 CERs could be sold to industrialized and transition coun-
</p>
<p>tries obliged to reduce their emissions in the Kyoto Protocol. The CDM program is 
</p>
<p>supervised by the CDM Executive Board under the authority of the Conference of 
</p>
<p>the Parties, the governing body for the Protocol.
</p>
<p>The approval for the second project of Waste Concern came in May 2006. The 
</p>
<p>two projects encompassed a plan for a dual-purpose operation consisting of a gas 
</p>
<p>recovery site and a 700-ton per day composting plant at the Matuail landfill site in 
</p>
<p>Dhaka. The Matuail Landfill site was owned and governed by the Dhaka City 
</p>
<p>Corporation (DCC), which was also responsible for the collection of waste from the 
</p>
<p>streets of Dhaka. For their CDM projects, Waste Concern planned to use the landfill 
</p>
<p>site provided by the DCC.&nbsp; The organization also wanted to take over the waste 
</p>
<p>collection from the markets in Dhaka, with the idea to turn the collected waste into 
</p>
<p>saleable compost. In addition, it planned to earn income by selling CERs.
</p>
<p>1 Each unit is an equivalent to one tonne of CO2.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>The projects seemed a win-win scenario for all stakeholders. Firstly, the projects 
</p>
<p>could earn income for Waste Concern and at the same time help the organization to 
</p>
<p>achieve various environmental and social benefits, including the reduction in green-
</p>
<p>house gases and creation of new jobs. Secondly, they could help Dhaka City 
</p>
<p>Corporation as it was struggling with collecting the growing mountains of waste 
</p>
<p>generated by an increasing number of Dhaka residents. Thirdly, the emissions could 
</p>
<p>be traded with industrialized and transition countries to help them achieve their 
</p>
<p>emission targets and, thus, the projects could promote the CDM and help realize the 
</p>
<p>Kyoto Protocol.
</p>
<p>However, the reality faced by the two founders of Waste Concern when imple-
</p>
<p>menting the CDM projects differed substantially from the business plans. The car-
</p>
<p>bon market plummeted and with it the prices that could be achieved through selling 
</p>
<p>CERs. The Dhaka City Corporation did not allow Waste Concern to access the 
</p>
<p>Matuail Landfill site. Additionally, the electricity crisis impacted the number of 
</p>
<p>composting plants that they could built as no new grid connections were allowed by 
</p>
<p>the government.
</p>
<p>Yet, Enayetullah and Sinha and Waste Concern managed to deal with these chal-
</p>
<p>lenges and turn them into opportunities: (1) They found a new site for the compost-
</p>
<p>ing project and built their first composting facility on that site; (2) They gradually 
</p>
<p>increased the capacity for the first composting plant when they were not able to 
</p>
<p>build more plants; (3) They introduced technological innovations such as Refuse- 
</p>
<p>Derived Fuel to gain additional sources of income for their projects; (4) They 
</p>
<p>exported the compost outside of Bangladesh for higher prices than possible within 
</p>
<p>the country; (5) They secured an agreement with the Asian Development Bank to 
</p>
<p>sell their CERs at the lowest cut-off point predicted in the business plan. At the same 
</p>
<p>time, Waste Concern focused on scaling up its waste management solutions outside 
</p>
<p>of Bangladesh with the help from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It also 
</p>
<p>started a new company promoting organic produce in Bangladesh. Waste Concern, 
</p>
<p>founded in 1995, was growing every day.
</p>
<p>As a result, on the cusp of the eighteenth birthday of Waste Concern, its founders 
</p>
<p>were running a different organization. They were proud of their achievements, but&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>keeping recent challenges in mind&nbsp;&ndash; they were also wary of the future and the tasks 
</p>
<p>lying ahead.
</p>
<p>From a simple non-profit, Waste Concern evolved into a hybrid organization 
</p>
<p>doing business with a social mission of making waste a resource. It literally was 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;making cash from trash&rdquo; (Ashoka n.d.), dealing with the challenges that no private 
</p>
<p>business in Bangladesh wanted to deal with.
</p>
<p>In addition, by engaging in CDM projects, cooperating with the Bill and Melinda 
</p>
<p>Gates Foundation, and engaging in the marketing and sale of organic products, 
</p>
<p>Enayetullah and Sinha expanded their organization in Bangladesh and abroad. The 
</p>
<p>evolution from a lean research, development and advisory services operation to a 
</p>
<p>broader diversified venture encompassing four companies, dealing with waste man-
</p>
<p>agement and organic agriculture as well as managing the Waste 2 Resource Fund 
</p>
<p>also created new organizational challenges.

</p>
<p>The identity of the organization was in constant flux. For one, Enayetullah and 
</p>
<p>Sinha saw themselves as serial entrepreneurs, designing and developing innovative 
</p>
<p>solutions to improve the waste management situation in Bangladesh. With the two 
</p>
<p>founders representing both the identity of Waste Concern towards external stake-
</p>
<p>holders and most of its management capacity the question of how to structure the 
</p>
<p>organization for future growth and impact became more prominent.
</p>
<p> Bangladesh
</p>
<p>Located between India and Burma, Bangladesh has a land area of 144,000&nbsp;km2 and 
</p>
<p>a population of nearly 164 million people (Central Intelligence Agency 2013).2 The 
</p>
<p>country has the eight largest populations in the world and also one of the highest 
</p>
<p>population densities at 1137 people per km2. It was estimated that approximately 
</p>
<p>28% of the country&rsquo;s population lives in an urban area. This was expected to increase 
</p>
<p>at 3.1% annually.
</p>
<p>Observers cited extreme monsoons and cyclones as the central impediments to 
</p>
<p>growth creating climatic instability. Additionally, poor transportation and commu-
</p>
<p>nication infrastructure, insufficient energy sources and ineffective government 
</p>
<p>reduce growth potential. However, last year the Economist named Bangladesh &ldquo;one 
</p>
<p>of the most intriguing puzzles in development&rdquo; (The Economist 2012) describing 
</p>
<p>the country as making social progress, especially when it comes to mortality rates 
</p>
<p>of infants and mothers at birth, as well as life expectancy. Social progress, though, 
</p>
<p>did not go hand in hand with economic development, with GDP per capita ranked 
</p>
<p>192nd out of 229 countries. GDP per head was around USD 2000&nbsp; in 2012 and 
</p>
<p>approximately 31.5% of the population lived below the poverty line. See Exhibit 26.1 
</p>

<p> Dhaka and&nbsp;Waste Management
</p>
<p>Population in urban areas such as the nation&rsquo;s capital, Dhaka, reached 43,000 peo-
</p>
<p>ple per km2. Dhaka is home to 15.4 million people and is expected to grow to 22.9 
</p>
<p>million by 2025 (World Urbanization Prospects, the 2011 Revision 2011). The resi-
</p>
<p>dents of Dhaka generate almost 5000&nbsp;tons of waste per day (CNN 2012). This com-
</p>
<p>pares to over 16,000&nbsp;tons of waste generated per day in urban areas of Bangladesh 
</p>
<p>(United Nations Centre for Regional Development 2011). This number is projected 
</p>
<p>to nearly triple by 2025&ndash;47,000&nbsp;tons of waste per day (United Nations Centre for 
</p>
<p>Regional Development 2011). In Dhaka, approximately 70&ndash;80% of the waste is 
</p>
<p>organic and the remainder is paper, plastic, glass and other man-made materials.
</p>
<p>The Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) is responsible for collecting all solid waste 
</p>
<p>in Dhaka. Estimates from the late 1990s show that the DCC was able to collect only 
</p>
<p>51% of all waste (Hai and Ali 2005). Nearly 9% of the waste was collected by indi-
</p>
<p>viduals known as Tokais, informal waste collectors seeking plastic, glass or paper to

</p>
<p> Early Trajectory of&nbsp;Waste Concern
</p>
<p>Enayetullah and Sinha met in 1993 while conducting research for their Master the-
</p>
<p>ses in Dhaka. These two graduate students with backgrounds in urban planning 
</p>
<p>found that they had something else in common. They believed that the increasing 
</p>
<p>amount of waste produced in Bangladesh was a serious problem. They both had 
</p>
<p>ideas on how to mitigate it: &ldquo;Both of our research findings had one common feature 
</p>
<p>which was that we must do all we can to convert waste into resources, because the 
</p>
<p>conventional system of collection and dumping will not solve the problem.&rdquo;3
</p>
<p>As part of their postgraduate research, Enayetullah and Sinha set up a model of 
</p>
<p>waste management whereby solid waste was collected and composted. The compost 
</p>
<p>would then be used as a substitute for chemical fertilizer. They initially decided to 
</p>
<p>approach governmental officials with this model, offering advice on waste manage-
</p>
<p>ment, but they were not successful: &ldquo;Nobody was interested initially; they laughed 
</p>
<p>and said we were graduates fresh from university, with new theories and ideas 
</p>
<p>which were not practical&rdquo;. One official suggested to them that they should pursue 
</p>
<p>their ideas solo. That is what they decided to do: &ldquo;This advice changed our life, 
</p>
<p>although we were little bit frustrated but it showed us to think differently.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>First they secured a piece of land in Mairpur, Dhaka with the help of a local 
</p>
<p>Lion&rsquo;s Club. They used the land for experiments with different methods of compost-
</p>
<p>ing, including the Chinese Covered Pile System (anaerobic method, where waste 
</p>
<p>was placed underground in a pit) and the Indonesian Windrow Technique (aerobic 
</p>
<p>method, where waste was piled in large heaps on top of a wooden structure and 
</p>
<p>turned every 4&ndash;5&nbsp;days). The latter method proved to be the best solution for Dhaka,

</p>
<p>as the first radiated smelly gas. Enayetullah and Sinha further adapted the Indonesian 
</p>
<p>method to Dhaka&rsquo;s conditions. As a result, they produced good quality compost and 
</p>
<p>the Lion&rsquo;s Club allowed them to continue work on the land.
</p>
<p> Waste Concern (1995)
</p>
<p>In 1995 Enayetullah and Sinha decided to register Waste Concern with the aim of 
</p>
<p>promoting the idea of converting waste into a resource. The organizations proceeded 
</p>
<p>to use the Lion&rsquo;s Club land as a demonstration ground for its composting solution.

</p>
<p>From the beginning, Waste Concern experimented with different methods of 
</p>
<p>waste recycling in order to reduce time and space needed for waste composting. To 
</p>
<p>replicate its solutions in other communities in Dhaka, Waste Concern teamed up 
</p>
<p>with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1998. Replications 
</p>
<p>outside Dhaka were possible from 2000&nbsp;&ndash; again due to UNDP support.
</p>
<p>In 2002 Enayetullah and Sinha assumed the role of technical partner/consultant for 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) and the governmental Department of 
</p>
<p>Public Health Engineering. Thus, they extended their work to additional cities in 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh. Next, in 2000, international replication started in partnership with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).
</p>
<p> Waste Concern Consultants (2000)
</p>
<p>Waste Concern relied on external funding as the organization was structured as a 
</p>
<p>non-profit: &ldquo;Financing was coming either from UN agencies or the government. That 
</p>
<p>was the area where we again thought that we are having impact but we are depen-
</p>
<p>dent too much on financing from the public sector.&rdquo; Waste Concern as a non- profit 
</p>
<p>was not able to generate its own income, nor get a bank loan. During meetings with 
</p>
<p>potential loan providers, it was suggested that the founders need to make a change in 
</p>
<p>Waste Concern&rsquo;s organizational structure through introducing a for-profit arm.
</p>
<p>As Enayetullah and Sinha were often approached by external organizations and 
</p>
<p>asked to provide consulting services, they decided to open a consulting business: 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are requesting us to give advisory services to different projects. And then we 
</p>
<p>look into it that this is not possible through Waste Concern. If we do it, at one point of 
</p>
<p>time, there would be a question mark within the board, and with the government, like 
</p>
<p>why are you doing it? This has happened with many of the organizations in Bangladesh.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As a result Enayetullah and Sinha decided to register their first for-profit venture, 
</p>
<p>Waste Concern Consultants, in 2000. Thirty percent of the profits from this venture 
</p>
<p>were going directly to Waste Concern non-profit to provide funding for researching 
</p>
<p>new solutions on how to convert waste into resources.
</p>
<p> WWR Bio Fertilizer Bangladesh, Ltd and&nbsp;Matuail Power Ltd (2005)
</p>
<p>In 2002, Enayetullah and Sinha as consultants were approached by the UNDP and 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Environment and Forest of Bangladesh. They were asked to identify 
</p>
<p>the starting points for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh. As a result, they produced a baseline study and business plans of the 
</p>
<p>first CDM projects in the country.
</p>
<p>After completing this assignment, Enayetullah and Sinha were concerned about 
</p>
<p>the lack of efforts to implement any of these business plans. This triggered the idea 
</p>
<p>to implement them as a part of Waste Concern. Thus, in 2003, Waste Concern started 
</p>
<p>pursuing the landfill gas recovery and composting projects envisaged in the baseline 
</p>
<p>study and business plans from 2002. The majority of waste in Bangladesh was 
</p>
<p>organic and the founders of Waste Concern saw a great potential in converting this 
</p>

<p>566
</p>
<p>waste into compost and thus, on the one hand&nbsp;&ndash; solving the problem of waste, on the 
</p>
<p>other hand&nbsp; &ndash; selling compost and generating other revenue using the CDM.&nbsp; No 
</p>
<p>other organization in Bangladesh was doing something like this.
</p>
<p>Waste Concern started looking for investors for these ideas and decided to con-
</p>
<p>tinue the CDM work: &ldquo;Then we informed UNDP that we are going to carry this on 
</p>
<p>beyond the project. They actually got really interested in that.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Enayetullah and Sinha also engaged in the policy making activities and helped to 
</p>
<p>create and develop the Designated National Authority for CDM projects in Bangladesh.
</p>
<p>In 2005, in continuation of their work on CDM projects in Bangladesh, Waste 
</p>
<p>Concern established two special purpose companies&nbsp; &ndash; WWR Bio Fertilizer 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh, Ltd. and Matuail Power Ltd. See Exhibit 26.5 for more information

<p>Brief 
description of 
the project 
activity
</p>
<p>The project aims to realize a 
landfill gas extraction and 
utilization project at Matuail 
landfill site near the capital 
Dhaka in the People&rsquo;s Republic 
of Bangladesh. The extracted gas 
will be used on-site for electricity 
generation by gas-engines. The 
project comprises the design and 
engineering of the extraction 
system according to modern 
standards, all equipment delivery 
(wells, piping, compressor(s), 
flare, gas-engines, grid 
connection, etc.). It is the 
intention of the project proponent 
to reshape the landfill (in order to 
extend the lifetime of the landfill) 
and introducing proper landfilling 
techniques such as a.o. leachate 
collection
</p>
<p>The project objective is the realization of 
a composting plant for organic waste on 
a site in the capital Dhaka of the People&rsquo;s 
Republic of Bangladesh. The project 
comprises the design and building of 
composting plants for waste from Dhaka 
city, with a total maximum daily input 
capacity of 700&nbsp;tons, according to proven 
standards. The project contributes to the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as 
the project activity provides an 
alternative to the original baseline 
scenario in Dhaka in which organic 
waste is disposed at local landfills. The 
anaerobic conversion of organic waste at 
the landfill generates methane gas (CH4) 
that emits into the atmosphere. By 
converting the organic waste from land 
filling towards composting, landfill gas 
methane emissions are for 100% being 
prevented

has been granted the right to collect 
organic waste from local street markets 
in Dhaka. Under the concession contract, 
which has duration of 15&nbsp;years with a 
starting date of January 2006, WWR BIO 
can collect up to 700&nbsp;tons of organic 
waste per day

</p>
<p>To establish the companies, Waste Concern first searched for suitable partners. 
</p>
<p>This was one of the external requirements for implementing CDM projects: &ldquo;To do 
</p>
<p>the CDM project, you need a partner from a developed country and from a develop-
</p>
<p>ing country. It is a trading. We cannot do it with Bangladesh organizations alone.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>In the process of looking for a suitable business partner, the organization rejected 
</p>
<p>those businesses that were clearly focused only on profit maximization, operating 
</p>
<p>without social objectives. In the end, it opted for more socially minded partners&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>World Wide Recycling (WWR), Triodos Bank and the Netherlands Development 
</p>
<p>Finance Company (FMO).
</p>
<p>Next, Waste Concern secured funding for the companies: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we make 
</p>
<p>the project bankable? We talked to several foreign banks, they said they were able to 
</p>
<p>finance our projects, although it had a low rate of return for them and it was not 
</p>
<p>commercial project (ed.). But it had a huge social environmental benefit (ed.).&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Later, Waste Concern registered its CDM projects with the CDM Board. It also 
</p>
<p>established a clear financial structure for these new ventures. All investors became 
</p>
<p>shareholders in the created companies. In the case of Waste Concern, Waste Concern 
</p>
<p>Consultants became a shareholder and Waste Concern took a role of a project par-
</p>
<p>ticipant in the CDM activities: &ldquo;Project participant is that Waste Concern will 
</p>
<p>ensure in the project that the low income people are benefiting (ed.).&rdquo; Profits gener-
</p>
<p>ated by the companies were distributed proportionally to all shareholders. Waste 
</p>
<p>Concern Consultants&rsquo; profit share was used to finance non-profit activities of Waste 
</p>
<p>Concern&nbsp;&ndash; that is was used for research and development.

<p> Waste Concern CDM Projects
</p>
<p> CDM Plans
</p>
<p>Waste Concern created its first special purpose company, Matuail Power Ltd., to 
</p>
<p>extract landfill gas and generate grid connected electricity at the Matuail landfill site 
</p>
<p>in Dhaka. The Matuail landfill site was owned and governed by the DCC.
</p>
<p>Under the second special purpose company, WWR Bio Fertilizer Bangladesh, 
</p>
<p>the organization wanted to construct three composting plants in Dhaka. Initially, it 
</p>
<p>aimed at building the plants on the Matuail landfill site governed by the DCC.&nbsp;It also 
</p>
<p>wanted to secure an agreement with the DCC to collect waste from Dhaka: &ldquo;We 
</p>
<p>collect the waste free of cost for the city, so that we are helping the city. That was 
</p>
<p>one of the mandates.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> CDM Challenges
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, both special purpose companies relied on the access to the 
</p>
<p>Matuail Landfill of DCC.&nbsp;However, access to the site was eventually not provided 
</p>
<p>by the DCC.&nbsp; In addition, Waste Concern experienced some problems due to the 
</p>
<p>volatility of the carbon market. When it started its CDM projects, the price of CO2 
</p>
<p>was high, at some point even above 30 euros per tonne. Then the price plummeted 
</p>
<p>down, at some point even to near zero. Although Waste Concern planned for 
</p>
<p>decreases in prices, nobody envisaged that the carbon market could be close to 
</p>
<p>crashing down. Waste Concern planned for 4.5 euros as the lowest price for 1&nbsp;tonne 
</p>
<p>of CO2.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Waste Concern was not able to open additional plants as planned, 
</p>
<p>as due to the energy crisis in Bangladesh, the government did not permit new grid 
</p>
<p>connections.
</p>
<p> CDM Strategic Reactions
Although the problems with the access to the Matuail landfill, volatility of the car-
</p>
<p>bon market, as well as the power and energy crisis in Bangladesh created severe 
</p>
<p>financial risks and delays to the CDM projects of Waste Concern, the organization 
</p>
<p>managed to proactively deal with these challenges, pointing out that &ldquo;when there is 
</p>
<p>a problem, there is also an opportunity&rdquo;. Waste Concern used the following five 
</p>
<p>strategies:
</p>
<p>Strategy 1: New site for the second project
</p>
<p>First compost plant created by WWR Bio Fertilizer Bangladesh opened in November 
</p>
<p>2008&nbsp;in Bulta. Arranging for financing, land and governmental permits took con-
</p>
<p>siderable time and delayed the opening of this plant.
</p>
<p>Strategy 2: Increased capacity for the existing compost plant
</p>
<p>Waste Concern decided to gradually increase the capacity of the existing plant when 
</p>
<p>the electricity crisis in Bangladesh made it difficult to open new plants.

</p>
<p>Strategy 3: Refuse-Derived Fuel
</p>
<p>The founders of Waste Concern developed a new technology for utilizing waste 
</p>
<p>rejects from the compost plant and turning them into fuel. This Refuse-Derived 
</p>
<p>Fuel can be sold and increase the cash flow for the CDM projects.
</p>
<p>Strategy 4: Exports of compost outside of Bangladesh
</p>
<p>Waste Concern also looked for opportunities to sell its compost abroad to Malaysia 
</p>
<p>and the Middle East Countries. The organization was successful and obtained 
</p>
<p>higher margins than for selling compost within Bangladesh.
</p>
<p>Strategy 5: Agreement with the Asian Development Bank
</p>
<p>Moreover, Waste Concern signed the agreement with the Asian Development Bank 
</p>
<p>to sell its carbon credits at the lowest price predicted in the original business plan 
</p>
<p>(4.5 euro). See Exhibit 26.6 for more information about the CDM challenges 
</p>
<p>encountered by Waste Concern and how the organization responded to them.

</p>
<p> New Ventures of&nbsp;Waste Concern
</p>
<p> Recycling Training Centre (2005)
</p>
<p>At the same time as developing CDM companies, Waste Concern engaged in yet 
</p>
<p>another project. In 2005 the organization started working on the first dedicated recy-
</p>
<p>cling training centre in Dhaka supported by the UNDP Sustainable Environment 
</p>
<p>Management Program. The aim was to increase Waste Concern&rsquo;s impact through 
</p>
<p>promotion of recycling among governmental officials, Waste Concern staff, and 
</p>
<p>prospective entrepreneurs: &ldquo;We thought that we needed to bring more people into 
</p>
<p>this, so we established a training centre in Dhaka. (&hellip;) We tried to create an entity 
</p>
<p>so that at one point it raises awareness and creates manpower (ed.).&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Waste Concern Baraka Agro Products (2006)
</p>
<p>Enayetullah and Sinha also innovated around organic produce and created another 
</p>
<p>new company&nbsp;&ndash; Waste Concern Baraka Agro Products. The company&rsquo;s aim was to 
</p>
<p>promote organic food and sustainable agriculture and create green jobs in 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh. On this venture, they partnered with Ahmed Amin Group.
</p>
<p>Initially, Waste Concern Baraka Agro Products was to produce organic food. 
</p>
<p>With time, the company added solar power irrigation and organic cotton to its prod-
</p>
<p>ucts. The idea to grow organic cotton was driven by the governmental programme 
</p>
<p>promoting cotton cultivation in Bangladesh. Enayetullah and Sinha seized this 
</p>
<p>external opportunity.
</p>
<p>Additionally, through their Schwab Foundation networks, they managed to con-
</p>
<p>vince a British based organic clothing company, People Tree, to pre-order their first 
</p>
<p>organic cotton yield.
</p>
<p>Waste Concern Baraka Agro Products succeeded in growing first organic cotton 
</p>
<p>in Bangladesh. However, shortly afterwards, the company experienced some prob-
</p>
<p>lems with cotton seeds, which had to be shipped from India. Thus, it rethought its 
</p>
<p>organic strategy and decided to focus efforts on growing other organic produce as 
</p>
<p>well as securing organic certification: &ldquo;The Agro Product project is on, and we are 
</p>
<p>working for certification. It takes around three to four years to get full certification 
</p>
<p>for organic crops, and we are in the process of doing so.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Waste 2 Resource (2009)
</p>
<p>Then, in 2009, Enayetullah and Sinha were approached by the Bill and Melinda 
</p>
<p>Gates Foundation to extend waste recycling training to other countries in Asia and 
</p>
<p>Africa. They decided to start providing training for interested organizations from 
</p>
<p>abroad. They also opened a new training centre in Sri Lanka and developed manuals 
</p>
<p>for composting plants to allow easy replication. Additionally, they convinced the 
</p>
<p>J. Radeke et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>571
</p>
<p>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to create a special fund under their management 
</p>
<p>to support pro-poor and sustainable solid waste management projects that reduce 
</p>
<p>greenhouse gases in developing countries.
</p>
<p> Going Forward
</p>
<p>When looking back at what had been achieved in the 18th years Enayetullah and 
</p>
<p>Sinha could point to an ever growing list of accomplishments of Waste Concern. 
</p>
<p>The organization and its creators engaged in waste management activities in 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh and abroad. They also started a number of innovative companies, 
</p>
<p>including those implementing CDM projects which performed well despite the 
</p>
<p>CDM market crisis. See Exhibit 26.7 for Waste Concern&rsquo;s organogram.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 26.7: Waste Concern&rsquo;s Organogram
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Enayetullah and Sinha saw themselves as serial entrepreneurs, developing new 
</p>
<p>ideas, patenting them, passing to others, and moving on to the next problem: &ldquo;Our 
</p>
<p>idea is to develop technology. Patent it. Give it to others. Create more companies to 
</p>
<p>do it. Not by ourselves (ed.) because then you create enemies!&rdquo;. When they were 
</p>
<p>evaluating new ventures they followed clear principles: &ldquo;One of the criteria is mar-
</p>
<p>ket failure. We always looked at whether someone has done it. If there is a private 
</p>
<p>sector operating there, if there are legal instrument in place, then there is no market 
</p>
<p>failure. If there is a market failure there, then we step in. This sector there was a 
</p>
<p>market failure with the solid waste. We stepped in. (&hellip;).&rdquo;
</p>
<p>They also highly valued the importance of flexibility, and flexibility was possible 
</p>
<p>with creation of spin-offs and letting go off their inventions: &ldquo;For social entrepre-
</p>
<p>neurs, or any entrepreneurs, what I believe is that you cannot make a business plan 
</p>
<p>too rigid. For social enterprise, if you make a business plan that is going to be for 
</p>
<p>five years, it is very difficult. It has to be very flexible, and you have to always adapt. 
</p>
<p>It has to be a living document kind of thing. It cannot be a fixed master plan. If you 
</p>
<p>do this, then you are in trouble. If you are opening a clear for-profit business, such 
</p>
<p>as a garment factory or a software company (ed.) you can do a business plan and 
</p>
<p>stick to it (ed.). But in social enterprises, operating in difficult contexts (ed.) making 
</p>
<p>a pure and rigid business plan is difficult because there are many unpredictable 
</p>
<p>situations.&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>26 Waste Concern: Fixing Market Failures</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>572
</p>
<p>This also created competition for Waste Concern: &ldquo;There are now 40 companies 
</p>
<p>registered, private sector and not-for-profit. Now even Dhaka city has given a con-
</p>
<p>tract to develop waste energy to an Italian company, just last year. People will say: 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;are you worried&rdquo;? We say: &ldquo;No, we are not worried, we are happy. We are happy 
</p>
<p>that the Italians are coming with new technology, new ideas. That&rsquo;s what we wanted.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>This attitude enabled Enayetullah and Sinha to start a number of innovative busi-
</p>
<p>nesses. But at the same time, Waste Concern was increasingly facing human resource 
</p>
<p>constraints that made it difficult to develop new ideas and projects. The biggest chal-
</p>
<p>lenge was to find qualified and socially motivated professionals: &ldquo;Now what we see 
</p>
<p>is that the professionals who are coming to us (ed.) they are not focused. Their goal 
</p>
<p>is to become rich in the shortest possible time. They apply for your company. They 
</p>
<p>want a salary of 100,000 Taka, with only two years&rsquo; experience.&rdquo; Another problem 
</p>
<p>was connected to the lack of leadership skills among young job applicants, the prob-
</p>
<p>lem that is probably too difficult to address for a single organization and Waste 
</p>
<p>Concern has not tackled it yet: &ldquo;I think for a developing country this is going to be a 
</p>
<p>huge challenge because there is a leadership vacuum not only in Bangladesh but in 
</p>
<p>the entire developing world. We have seen this thing in Sri Lanka. We have seen this 
</p>
<p>in Nepal, in India, Pakistan, wherever you go. It&rsquo;s a huge amount of population, 
</p>
<p>which is too young and without role models. It&rsquo;s going to be serious problem.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Over the years, Enayetullah and Sinha became experts on waste management, 
</p>
<p>not only in the eyes of the officials from the government of Bangladesh, but also 
</p>
<p>among the international development organizations. They received the most presti-
</p>
<p>gious awards and joined the most respected networks. See Exhibit 26.8 for more 
</p>
<p>information on their network exposure and awards. At the same time, none of these 
</p>
<p>achievements were accomplished easily. Enayetullah and Sinha knew too well that 
</p>
<p>the path to success was not a paved road but a bumpy up-hill struggle.

<p>27Uber and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ethics of&nbsp;Sharing: Exploring the&nbsp;Societal Promises 
and&nbsp;Responsibilities of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Sharing 
Economy
</p>
<p>N. Craig&nbsp;Smith and&nbsp;Erin&nbsp;McCormick
</p>
<p>&bull; In San Francisco, a six-year-old girl was run over by a driver for the ride-hailing 
</p>
<p>service Uber, as the driver drove around waiting for the company&rsquo;s mobile app to 
</p>
<p>direct him to his next passenger.
</p>
<p>&bull; In Paris, taxi drivers rioted in the streets, protesting that a subsidiary of Uber, the 
</p>
<p>fastest growing company in the so-called &ldquo;sharing economy&rdquo;, was stealing their 
</p>
<p>business without respecting the rules and regulations of the trade.
</p>
<p>&bull; In London, Uber drivers sued the company, insisting it pay the minimum wage 
</p>
<p>and follow the same safety regulations as other employers.
</p>
<p>&bull; In Australia, the tax office cracked down, demanding that Uber drivers pay the 
</p>
<p>national business tax on each fare.
</p>
<p>In each case, Uber has argued that it is not the primary responsible party. In ques-
</p>
<p>tions of safety, transportation regulation, labour rights and business taxes, Uber 
</p>
<p>often defers responsibility to its &ldquo;driver-partners&rsquo;&nbsp; &ndash; many of whom are ordinary 
</p>
<p>people picking up passengers in their personal cars. The company maintains that it 
</p>
<p>only provides an online platform to connect customers with &ldquo;independent contrac-
</p>
<p>tors&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; drivers in business for themselves.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a technology platform that connects riders and drivers,&rdquo; said Travis Kalanick, 
</p>
<p>co-founder and CEO of Uber.1 &ldquo;So you want a ride, we are going to connect you to 
</p>
<p>all the transportation providers that are available in a market, and we&rsquo;re going to get 
</p>
<p>you the quickest pick-up time, highest quality ride, and get it to you at the lowest 
</p>
<p>cost that&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>With operations in 300 cities worldwide and more than $8 billion in equity fund-
</p>
<p>ing, Uber is quickly becoming one of the world&rsquo;s most highly-valued companies, at

</p>
<p>the forefront of a growing breed of tech-based companies leveraging the powerful 
</p>
<p>economic engine dubbed the &ldquo;sharing economy&rdquo;. The company, and thousands of 
</p>
<p>other start-ups like it, provide ways for people to share their underutilized posses-
</p>
<p>sions&nbsp;&ndash; cars, bedrooms, parking spaces and even clothing. In the meantime, they are 
</p>
<p>turning basic norms&nbsp;&ndash; about consumption, work and regulations&nbsp;&ndash; on their heads.
</p>
<p>The whole nature of what it means to do business is being redefined by compa-
</p>
<p>nies like Uber, Airbnb, which rents out space in people&rsquo;s homes, and Taskrabbit, 
</p>
<p>which lines up workers to help customers with odd jobs. But while &ldquo;sharing econ-
</p>
<p>omy&rdquo; companies hold out a promise of increased sustainability and democratization 
</p>
<p>of the workplace, they raise questions about how such changes affect societal safety 
</p>
<p>nets.
</p>
<p>Are they merely &ldquo;technological platforms&rdquo;, facilitating transactions for individ-
</p>
<p>ual business people? Or are they real-world companies, with the same responsibili-
</p>
<p>ties as transport companies, hotels and employment agencies? In some cases, their 
</p>
<p>very survival depends on the answer to these questions.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 27.1 The Economist cover illustrates some facets of the &ldquo;sharing 
</p>
<p>economy&rdquo;
</p>
<p> An Economy Built on&nbsp;Technology and&nbsp;Trust
</p>
<p>If you own a power drill, &ldquo;that drill will be used for 12 to 15 minutes in its entire life 
</p>
<p>time,&rdquo; Rachel Botsman, one of the early proponents of the sharing economy, told a 
</p>
<p>Ted Talk audience in 2010. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous, isn&rsquo;t it? Because what you need

</p>
<p>is the hole, not the drill. Why don&rsquo;t you rent the drill? Or rent out your own drill to 
</p>
<p>other people and make some money from it?&rdquo;2
</p>
<p>Launched with this vision of cooperation amongst a broad internet community, 
</p>
<p>the sharing economy was described by Botsman as &ldquo;an economic model based on 
</p>
<p>sharing underutilized assets from spaces to skills to stuff for monetary or non- 
</p>
<p>monetary benefits.&rdquo;3 The term&nbsp;&ndash; used interchangeably with the &ldquo;peer-to-peer econ-
</p>
<p>omy&rdquo; or the &ldquo;collaborative economy&rdquo;&nbsp; &ndash; depicts an enterprise platform in which 
</p>
<p>regular people do business with their neighbours rather than relying on big 
</p>
<p>companies.
</p>
<p>The sharing economy was made possible by the ease of sharing data brought on 
</p>
<p>by the internet age. Be it a person&rsquo;s Facebook profile or their location as tracked by 
</p>
<p>the GPS on their smartphone, free-flowing information has made it possible to make 
</p>
<p>transactions to share goods and services which once might have gone unused. In the 
</p>
<p>past it was so hard for people to find others with whom to share goods like unused 
</p>
<p>tools and extra bedspace, that it wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble. But the internet and the 
</p>
<p>availability of data have dramatically reduced the &ldquo;transaction costs&rdquo;, ushering in an 
</p>
<p>era of collaborative consumption in which underutilized goods can easily be turned 
</p>
<p>into cash.
</p>
<p>A new sense of trust in the online community, based on feedback, is another key 
</p>
<p>building block of the new economy. Where consumers might once have been afraid 
</p>
<p>to catch a ride or share a house with a stranger, they now can check out a person&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>trustworthiness based on ratings from previous passengers or reviews from former 
</p>
<p>houseguests.
</p>
<p>The sharing economy gives access to all kinds of products and services without 
</p>
<p>having to commit to ownership or hiring. Why own a car, when in minutes you can 
</p>
<p>borrow one? Supporters extol the benefits for the environment: if commuters share 
</p>
<p>rides, there are fewer cars on the road; if people share their rollerblades instead of 
</p>
<p>buying new ones, it reduces the use of raw materials and the pollution of 
</p>
<p>production.
</p>
<p>Yet as it has grown, the sharing economy hasn&rsquo;t always lived up to the early 
</p>
<p>vision of &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; among &ldquo;peers&rdquo;.
</p>
<p> Sharing as&nbsp;Big Business
</p>
<p>A host of creative technology start-ups emerged to develop the intricate internet 
</p>
<p>platforms and smartphone applications needed to make these peer-to-peer transac-
</p>
<p>tions easy. Uber, Lyft and BlaBlaCar connect drivers to people who need rides. 
</p>
<p>Airbnb helps people rent out their extra beds. Parkatmyhouse connects drivers to

</p>
<p>parking spaces. TaskRabbit in the US and TaskPandas in the UK line up workers for 
</p>
<p>people needing help with small jobs. NeighborGoods helps people share tools. But 
</p>
<p>as the sharing economy has grown from a fringe concept to a huge industry, some 
</p>
<p>of these companies have acquired the scale and characteristics of the big businesses 
</p>
<p>they were supposed to replace.
</p>
<p>Unlike traditional brick and mortar businesses, these new firms can sell rides or 
</p>
<p>rentals without having to invest capital to buy cars or build hotel rooms. Whereas it 
</p>
<p>took the world&rsquo;s biggest hotel chain, InterContinental Hotels, 65&nbsp;years to build a 
</p>
<p>chain of 650,000 rooms in 100 countries, Airbnb did it in four years.4 Uber wasn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>founded until 2009, but it is already valued at more than $60 billion&nbsp;&ndash; twice the 
</p>
<p>estimated value of Hertz Car Rental5&nbsp;&ndash; without owning a single taxi.
</p>
<p>Many of these companies and their users appear to have none of the altruistic 
</p>
<p>motivations connoted by the term &ldquo;sharing&rdquo;. Proponents of the sharing economy, 
</p>
<p>including Rachel Botsman, who co-founded Zipcar, one of the first companies to 
</p>
<p>emerge under the umbrella term, have proposed an alternative terminology: they sug-
</p>
<p>gest that companies giving consumers instant online access to other people&rsquo;s goods 
</p>
<p>and services should be called the &ldquo;on-demand economy&rdquo; or &ldquo;the access economy&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Despite little agreement as to what this new business phenomenon should be 
</p>
<p>called, PricewaterhouseCoopers has identified five sectors of the so-called sharing 
</p>
<p>economy&nbsp;&ndash; peer-to-peer finance, staffing, car sharing, accommodation and music 
</p>
<p>and video streaming. PwC estimates that collectively these earned global revenues 
</p>
<p>of $15 billion annually in 2014, a figure that could jump to $335 billion by 2025.6
</p>
<p>As they have grown, many of these companies have sidestepped the local regula-
</p>
<p>tions that competitors in traditional businesses face. While taxi companies operate 
</p>
<p>within local limits on the number of cabs and regulations about using airports, Uber 
</p>
<p>has often managed to avoid such rules. Similarly, Airbnb has faced complaints that 
</p>
<p>a large number of rentals on its site are illegal. A 2014 report by the State of 
</p>
<p>New&nbsp;York&rsquo;s Attorney General found that 72% of private short-term units offered on 
</p>
<p>Airbnb in New&nbsp;York City appeared to be illegal under state and local zoning laws.7
</p>
<p>Some fear that these companies can use their size and the advantages gained by 
</p>
<p>side-stepping local laws to drive traditional competitors out of business, much as 
</p>
<p>Amazon.com has done with local bookstores. &ldquo;There is often room for just one suc-
</p>
<p>cessful platform in a market and the &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo;&rdquo;, wrote Felix Barber of 
</p>
<p>Ashridge Business School. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no surprise that the old monopoly concerns are 
</p>
<p>arising anew.&rdquo;8

</p>
<p>From the day it first launched its app in its home town of San Francisco in 2010, 
</p>
<p>Uber has used the latest technological advances to make ride-hailing super-efficient.

<p>developers spent nearly a year building systems to predict rider demand and get cars 
</p>
<p>to those areas, then set the price based on demand. Early on, Uber hired a rocket 
</p>
<p>scientist, a computational neuroscientist and a nuclear physicist to develop an algo-
</p>
<p>rithm for predicting how long it would take for cars to reach their passengers.9 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a ton of math, which basically makes sure that riders get a car in five 
</p>
<p>minutes,&rdquo; said Uber founder Kalanick, promoting the then-new company at the 
</p>
<p>2011 Tech Crunch Disrupt conference.10
</p>
<p>Passengers can look at the app on their smartphones and see all the Uber cars 
</p>
<p>travelling the streets near them. Once they request a car, the app allows passengers 
</p>
<p>to see their driver approach via a city map. The fare is calculated by the app, based 
</p>
<p>on time and mileage: if it is a busy period, fares can be doubled or more, based on 
</p>
<p>Uber&rsquo;s &ldquo;surge pricing&rdquo;. At the end of the ride, the app automatically deducts the cost 
</p>
<p>from the user&rsquo;s Paypal or credit card account. Drivers are paid by Uber after it has 
</p>
<p>deducted its commission&nbsp;&ndash; usually 20%.11

<p>As the app became hugely popular, investors poured billions of dollars into the 
</p>
<p>company, which is still privately held. The company expanded to one new city per 
</p>
<p>month as of 2011, quickly adding Washington DC, New&nbsp;York City and Chicago. 
</p>
<p>The first city outside the US was Paris in 2011, followed by a push to launch in cities 
</p>
<p>around the world. By mid-2015, Uber had service in 177 North American cities and 
</p>
<p>in 60 countries around the world, in places as diverse as Seoul, Lima, and Cape 
</p>
<p>Town.12
</p>
<p>Uber describes its mission as &ldquo;evolving the way the world moves&hellip;by seam-
</p>
<p>lessly connecting riders to drivers.&rdquo;13 With Uber, instead of standing on the street or 
</p>
<p>calling a cab and waiting, passengers can stay inside and watch the progress of the 
</p>
<p>car on their smartphones. &ldquo;This is a real boon for consumers who don&rsquo;t like long 
</p>
<p>waits or uncertainty&mdash;which is to say everyone,&rdquo; writes Brishen Rogers, Associate 
</p>
<p>Professor of Law at Temple University. &ldquo;The result is that Uber may be creating 
</p>
<p>what once appeared impossible: a functioning market for car-hire services that is 
</p>
<p>governed largely by supply and demand.&rdquo;14
</p>
<p>Customers praise the app for allowing them to reliably hail taxis around the 
</p>
<p>world and have all their transactions conveniently billed to the same credit card&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>without having to worry about having the right currency or having to negotiate fares 
</p>
<p>with local drivers.
</p>
<p>Dozens of competitors to Uber have emerged around the world, including Lyft in 
</p>
<p>the US, Didi Kuaidi in China, Grab in Southeast Asia, Chauffeur-Priv&eacute; and Snapcar 
</p>
<p>in France, and Gett in the UK.&nbsp;But Uber is by far the biggest. With its huge valua-
</p>
<p>tion, aggressive business practices, and no-holds-barred approach to dealing with 
</p>
<p>adversaries, the company is quickly gaining a reputation as the bad guy of the new 
</p>
<p>business model. Its behaviour raises the question: What are the responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>sharing economy enterprises?

</p>
<p> Regulating Disruption or Disrupting Regulation?
</p>
<p>When it comes to dealing with government rules for the strictly regulated transpor-
</p>
<p>tation industry, Uber&rsquo;s policy is to launch its business in new markets first and 
</p>
<p>respond to questions later. It has sidestepped regulations, refused to comply with 
</p>
<p>demands to cease business in certain markets, and angered traditional industry com-
</p>
<p>petitors (mainly taxi drivers) at every step.
</p>
<p>The patchwork of Great Depression-era regulations governing the transport 
</p>
<p>industry in cities around the world has long served to reduce competition. In the 
</p>
<p>current climate of rapid change, these regulations have left taxi cabs at a disadvan-
</p>
<p>tage in competing with Uber. In most cities, cabs follow strict rules&nbsp; &ndash; stringent 
</p>
<p>vehicle inspections, set fares monitored by standard meters, and strict driver train-
</p>
<p>ing and screening. Companies pay permitting fees, local business taxes, and must 
</p>
<p>have commercial insurance. In exchange for complying with these regulations, 
</p>
<p>many cities protect cab owners by issuing only a limited number of licenses to oper-
</p>
<p>ate&ndash; essentially creating a quasi-monopoly. These limits are designed to ensure that 
</p>
<p>taxi drivers make a reasonable wage, but in some instances they have created a 
</p>
<p>shortage of cabs and inadequate service. In some cities, taxi drivers have made a 
</p>
<p>business of reselling medallions (licences), which have become a commodity worth 
</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of dollars. Uber is a threat to that practice as well.
</p>
<p>When it started operations in the San Francisco area in summer 2010, under the 
</p>
<p>name &ldquo;Ubercab&rdquo;, Uber avoided taxi regulations by positioning itself as a limousine 
</p>
<p>service. It hired only licensed chauffeurs with charter vehicles, who ostensibly used 
</p>
<p>the app to find extra riders. Three months later, the California agency that regulated 
</p>
<p>limousines ordered Ubercab to cease doing business because it wasn&rsquo;t licensed as a 
</p>
<p>transportation company. It responded by simply changing its name to &ldquo;Uber&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>Thereafter it continued to operate under threat of penalties, including $5000 per 
</p>
<p>instance of violating the order.15
</p>
<p>Soon Uber (and several competing start-ups) started contracting with regular car 
</p>
<p>owners to provide rides to passengers in San Francisco&nbsp;&ndash; claiming the arrangements 
</p>
<p>were exempt from regulation because they were &ldquo;ridesharing&rdquo;. Today, both regular 
</p>
<p>car owners and professional drivers drive for Uber. In the US, Uber signs up licensed 
</p>
<p>chauffeurs to drive for its upscale &ldquo;UberBlack,&rdquo; service, but the majority of its driv-
</p>
<p>ers are ordinary people driving their personal cars for &ldquo;UberX&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>After it was found that people without a license were driving for Uber, cab driv-
</p>
<p>ers cried &ldquo;foul play&rdquo; and began a series of protests against Uber and its competi-
</p>
<p>tors&nbsp;&ndash; claiming the online ride-hailing services were unfair, unregulated and unsafe. 
</p>
<p>As ride-hailing services grew, protests spread to cities around the world. Taxi driv-
</p>
<p>ers shut down the streets in Boston, London, Rio de Janeiro, Guangzhou and Mexico 
</p>
<p>City, complaining that it was harder for them to find fares and make a living because 
</p>
<p>of competition from Uber and other ride-hailing services which did not follow the 
</p>
<p>same regulations. The value of taxi licenses has seen a sharp fall. In New&nbsp;York City,

<p>Exhibit 27.10 French taxi drivers confront riot police in Paris in a protest

<p>against Uber in 2016
</p>
<p>In Paris, where drivers undergo hundreds of hours of study and often get into 
</p>
<p>debt to purchase taxi licenses for as much as &euro;240,000,17 drivers complain that Uber 
</p>
<p>is devaluing government-issued licenses. In the summer of 2015 and again in early 
</p>
<p>2016, taxi drivers burned tires and blocked airport access in a series of strikes pro-
</p>
<p>testing against Uber.18 The 2015 Paris protests, in which drivers presumed to be 
</p>
<p>driving for Uber were attacked, were sparked by its refusal to shut down the UberPop 
</p>
<p>service, which was deemed illegal by the French government because it used regu-
</p>
<p>lar drivers without a chauffeur&rsquo;s license. The company continued to operate the 
</p>
<p>service until June 2015, when police arrested its top executives in France on charges 
</p>
<p>of enabling illegal taxi services.19 Uber suspended the operations of UberPop in

<p>France while its managers awaited trial, but continued to operate UberX, which 
</p>
<p>used licensed chauffeurs.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand that new technology is disruptive: not just for established com-
</p>
<p>panies, but for the people who work in them and their families,&rdquo; Uber said, in a 
</p>
<p>statement. &ldquo;This is especially true at a time of high unemployment. But we believe 
</p>
<p>there is a way forward &hellip;Hundreds of taxi drivers have already switched over to 
</p>
<p>Uber and are making a better living, with a work schedule to suit their family&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>needs. It is heartbreaking to see the violence in the streets when we know that taxi 
</p>
<p>drivers can earn more on the Uber platform. It&rsquo;s why we need to do a better job 
</p>
<p>explaining and communicating the advantages of Uber to all drivers.&rdquo;20
</p>
<p> Armies of&nbsp;Lobbyists
</p>
<p>When it comes to dealing with government regulators, Uber co-founder Travis 
</p>
<p>Kalanick espouses a strategy of &ldquo;principled confrontation&rdquo;: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re totally legal, 
</p>
<p>like totally legal, and the government is telling us to shut down. And you can either 
</p>
<p>do what they say or you can fight for what you believe,&rdquo; said Kalanick of Uber&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>refusal to give in to government requests that the company cease service in San 
</p>
<p>Francisco.21
</p>
<p>When Portland, Oregon asked Uber to refrain from starting service until the city 
</p>
<p>could draft new rules for transportation services, Uber simply threw a launch party 
</p>
<p>and sent drivers out to pick up passengers.22 Three days later, Portland sued, charg-
</p>
<p>ing that Uber services violated more than 20 civil and criminal regulations requiring 
</p>
<p>private transportation services to have permits, insurance, decals, rates and record- 
</p>
<p>keeping.23 According to Portland officials, Uber unleashed a lobbying effort like 
</p>
<p>none ever seen before. The company hired 10 lobbyists, including one who had 
</p>
<p>been campaign advisor to the same Portland officials making the decisions. It used 
</p>
<p>its customer database to get thousands of people to sign an online petition, calling 
</p>
<p>on city officials to allow Uber to operate in Portland.24 City officials caved in and 
</p>
<p>allowed Uber to operate for a &ldquo;trial period&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>With billions of dollars in investor capital, Uber is able to hire a fleet of lobbyists 
</p>
<p>to overwhelm officials in places it wants to launch. According to Bloomberg News,

<p>Uber has hired 250 lobbyists and 29 lobbying firms to negotiate with US state and 
</p>
<p>federal officials&nbsp;&ndash; more than the entire Walmart chain&nbsp;&ndash; and this doesn&rsquo;t include 
</p>
<p>those lobbying cities.25 It hired David Plouffe, former campaign manager for 
</p>
<p>President Barrack Obama, to spearhead its campaign to win government approval.

</p>
<p>In New&nbsp;York, Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed capping the number of for-hire 
</p>
<p>drivers to deal with growing congestion and pollution on the city&rsquo;s streets. The num-
</p>
<p>ber of for-hire vehicles had increased by 25,000 cars or 63% between 2011 and 
</p>
<p>mid-2015&nbsp;&ndash; largely because of the growth of Uber drivers.26 But the mayor backed 
</p>
<p>down and agreed to a four-month study of the situation after a barrage of lobbying 
</p>
<p>that included Uber releasing a feature on its app called &ldquo;de Blasio view&rdquo; which 
</p>
<p>showed how much service would be slowed if the cap were enacted.
</p>
<p>In France, attempts to limit Uber had an almost comical air. Officials attempted 
</p>
<p>to impose a 15-minute delay for customers ordering a ride &ldquo;to level the playing

</p>
<p>In London, where drivers spend years studying &ldquo;The Knowledge&rdquo; of every city 
</p>
<p>street to get a license to drive a black cab, taxi drivers paralyzed the streets with a 
</p>
<p>protest against Uber in summer of 2014. The authorities threatened to crack down 
</p>
<p>on Uber drivers with new regulations, including a ban on apps that show cars imme-
</p>
<p>diately available for hire and a requirement that cars wait at least five minutes after 
</p>
<p>being booked to pick up their passengers. Uber called on its customers to lobby 
</p>
<p>against these proposals, claiming these rules would be &ldquo;the end of the Uber you 
</p>
<p>know and love&rdquo;. While still planning to issue new rules governing driver qualifica-
</p>
<p>tions, the transportation authorities dropped the most threatening proposals after 
</p>
<p>receiving 16,000 responses from the public.28
</p>
<p> Business Tactics Questioned
</p>
<p>Uber has repeatedly been accused of using aggressive business practices to stifle 
</p>
<p>competition and silence critics:
</p>
<p>In 2014, a number of investigative reports outlined the steps the company took to 
</p>
<p>hinder its largest competitor, Lyft. CNN Money obtained documents backing up 
</p>
<p>Lyft&rsquo;s claims that Uber employees were making bogus calls to order thousands of 
</p>
<p>Lyft rides, then cancelling them, thereby jamming the efficiency of Lyft&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>services.29
</p>
<p>The tech industry blog, The Verge, reportedly obtained internal documents from 
</p>
<p>Uber showing it had a programme called &ldquo;SLOG,&rdquo; by which it gave contractors 
</p>
<p>dummy cell phones to order Lyft rides and then attempt to recruit the competitor&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>drivers.30 Uber called the charges of cancelled rides &ldquo;patently false&rdquo;, but acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged running incentive programmes encouraging drivers and riders to recruit Lyft 
</p>
<p>drivers to join Uber.31

</p>
<p>Uber co-founder Kalanick surprised business journalists by admitting in a Vanity 
</p>
<p>Fair interview that he had approached potential Lyft investors just before a Lyft 
</p>
<p>fundraising round and tried to get them to fund Uber instead.32
</p>
<p>Uber was forced to apologize after an Uber senior vice president outlined to 
</p>
<p>guests at a dinner party the idea that Uber could spend a million dollars hiring oppo-
</p>
<p>sition researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticized Uber. The remarks of 
</p>
<p>Emil Michael were reported by a technology blog editor who attended the dinner 
</p>
<p>party, which Uber said were supposed to be off-the-record.33 Michael later issued an 
</p>
<p>apology through an Uber spokeswoman, saying his remarks were &ldquo;born out of frus-
</p>
<p>tration during an informal debate&rdquo; and were &ldquo;wrong no matter the circumstance&rdquo;.34
</p>
<p>Competitors charge that the company uses the &lsquo;war chest&rsquo; obtained from inves-
</p>
<p>tors to set prices so low it will drive taxi companies and other car services out of 
</p>
<p>business. In order to outdo competitors, Uber has repeatedly cut fares to the point 
</p>
<p>where they are lower than most taxi fares. In some cases it has even made a loss, 
</p>
<p>paying its drivers more than customer pays for the ride.35 In order to lure drivers and 
</p>
<p>build its service in France, Uber paid drivers bonuses of $1100 a week&nbsp;&ndash; more than 
</p>
<p>it made from those drivers, according to documents obtained by the business journal 
</p>
<p>TechCrunch.36 &ldquo;Uber is a steam roller that wants to flatten everything,&rdquo; said 
</p>
<p>Chauffeur-Priv&eacute; CEO Yan Hascoet.37 &ldquo;People need to know how Uber does busi-
</p>
<p>ness, in particular when it comes to anti-competitive practices. We are looking into 
</p>
<p>possible legal action.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Some compare Uber&rsquo;s business tactics to those of Andrew Carnegie and John 
</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;Rockefeller, the monopoly-building tycoons of the American industrial revolu-
</p>
<p>tion. &ldquo;Uber&rsquo;s ambitions are limitless and it has the bankroll to do what it wants. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, there is some irony to the fact that Uber has so much cash in the bank that it 
</p>
<p>need not comply with the most basic premise of capitalism&nbsp;&mdash; the notion that sur-
</p>
<p>vival is predicated on making more money than you spend,&rdquo; wrote Andrew Leonard,

<p>a columnist with Salon magazine.38 &ldquo;With access to an astonishing $1.5 billion in 
</p>
<p>capital, Uber can simultaneously wage regulatory battles in multiple cities, engage 
</p>
<p>in recruitment wars in which smartphones are distributed like candy, subsidize driv-
</p>
<p>ers at below cost, and employ whomever is necessary to achieve long-term goals.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Uber&rsquo;s capital funding has since grown to more than $8 billion).
</p>
<p>The company waves aside claims that it is overly-aggressive, saying it is natural 
</p>
<p>for market disrupters to make enemies. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t subscribe to the idea that the com-
</p>
<p>pany has an image problem,&rdquo; Uber strategist David Plouffe told Vanity Fair. &ldquo;I actu-
</p>
<p>ally think when you are a disrupter you are going to have a lot of people throwing 
</p>
<p>arrows.&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Seeking New Rules in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Regulatory Hodgepodge
</p>
<p>In its first years, Uber often operated beneath the radar of local law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies that regulated cab services, portraying its drivers as private citizens who 
</p>
<p>were just sharing rides. It often avoided airport charges, taxes and permit fees. In 
</p>
<p>California, airports complained that drivers for Uber, Lyft and similar apps, picked 
</p>
<p>up passengers at airport curbsides without paying for the permits required of all 
</p>
<p>other transportation operators.39
</p>
<p>More recently Uber has begun to negotiate regulatory frameworks&nbsp; &ndash; and fee 
</p>
<p>structures&nbsp;&ndash; with some local governments. Airports in San Francisco and Washington 
</p>
<p>DC now officially allow drivers affiliated with Uber and other transportation apps to 
</p>
<p>pick up passengers for a fee of $4. Chicago levies a tax of 52 cents a ride on each 
</p>
<p>Uber ride, while Nevada recently legalized car-share pick-ups and charges a 3% 
</p>
<p>excise tax on each ride&nbsp;&ndash; which could raise $100 million over two years.40
</p>
<p>The company has fought aggressively to avoid the tight regulations and fees that 
</p>
<p>taxi companies have traditionally faced. It has shut down service in some cities 
</p>
<p>rather than comply. These include Frankfurt and Hamburg (Germany), where a 
</p>
<p>judge ruled drivers must get the same licenses as taxi drivers, and Galveston, Texas, 
</p>
<p>where Uber ceased operations in early 2016 after the city passed a law requiring its 
</p>
<p>drivers to get chauffeur licenses, including fingerprint background checks. &ldquo;A very 
</p>
<p>small handful of cities have decided to impose burdensome regulations on this new 
</p>
<p>economic engine,&rdquo; Uber said in a letter to its drivers in Galveston. &ldquo;We know from

<p>experience in other markets that these rules can have a devastating impact on our 
</p>
<p>ability to provide the experience that riders and drivers have come to expect.&rdquo;41
</p>
<p>In Australia, the company is challenging a tax ruling which says Uber drivers 
</p>
<p>must pay the same 10% Goods &amp; Service Tax that taxi operators pay. Uber has told 
</p>
<p>its drivers there not to pay the tax unless a financial consultant advises it.42 The 
</p>
<p>company said a whole new set of rules needs to be developed to cover the new eco-
</p>
<p>nomic model of the on-demand economy. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think that it is appropriate that 
</p>
<p>the tax office has essentially applied a 1999 law to what is a brand new business 
</p>
<p>model that didn&rsquo;t envisage this type of activity,&rdquo; said Brad Kitschke, Uber director 
</p>
<p>of public policy for Oceania, at a hearing on the Australia tax ruling.
</p>
<p>Many jurisdictions which initially proposed new regulations designed to regulate 
</p>
<p>Uber similarly to taxis, have backed down after lobbying by Uber and its drivers and 
</p>
<p>customers. Proposals seem to have been dropped in both New&nbsp;York City, where 
</p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed limits on the number of Uber cars in the city, and 
</p>
<p>London, which proposed rules to make Uber cars wait before picking up passen-
</p>
<p>gers&nbsp;&ndash; after thousands of people sent messages of protest.
</p>
<p>In San Jose, the city dropped a plan to require drivers for Uber and other ride- 
</p>
<p>hailing apps to pass a fingerprint background check similar to those required of taxi 
</p>
<p>drivers in order to pick up riders at its airport. Instead, it ended up loosening require-
</p>
<p>ments for taxi drivers. &ldquo;Either the city should deregulate us completely, like them &hellip; 
</p>
<p>or regulate them at least closer to us, and let there be fair business competition,&rdquo; said 
</p>
<p>Kirpal Bajwa, a taxi driver and union leader in San Jose.43
</p>
<p>It may take time for regulators to catch up to the disruptive changes hitting the 
</p>
<p>transportation industry, says Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation 
</p>
<p>Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley: &ldquo;Innovation 
</p>
<p>has gotten out ahead of the public policy environment,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Things haven&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>changed in 100 years in this industry and suddenly it&rsquo;s changing rapidly and I think 
</p>
<p>everyone is still figuring out what that means.&rdquo;44

<p> Environmental Promise?
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride-sharing&rdquo; has long been hailed by environmentalists as a way to avoid the traf-
</p>
<p>fic, pollution and the environmental scourge of millions of single-occupancy vehi-
</p>
<p>cles moving around city streets. Uber and other ride-hailing companies tout their 
</p>
<p>services as part of the solution for improving cities, but exactly how services like 
</p>
<p>Uber and Lyft affect the environment is open to question.
</p>
<p>For example, if using ride-hailing apps means consumers no longer have to own 
</p>
<p>a car or if they make it easier for people to go out at night and leave their cars at 
</p>
<p>home, that could help ease the difficulty of providing parking places and mean that 
</p>
<p>fewer cars are manufactured. But if Uber rides add extra miles or replace trips taken 
</p>
<p>on public transport, the environmental effect would be negative.
</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, where historically residents have depended on cars, ride-hailing 
</p>
<p>apps are spawning a new era of car-free socializing, according to the New York 
</p>
<p>Times, which reported that users were flooding the nightclub scene: &ldquo;Untethered 
</p>
<p>from their vehicles, Angelenos are suddenly free to drink, party and walk places.&rdquo;45 
</p>
<p>Despite investing billions in new public transport options, Los Angeles has seen a 
</p>
<p>drop in residents&rsquo; usage of such forms of transport&nbsp;&ndash; which experts blame, in part, 
</p>
<p>on the popularity of ride-hailing services, as well as low gas prices.46
</p>
<p>More promising for the environment is Uber&rsquo;s carpooling service&nbsp;&ndash; UberPOOL, 
</p>
<p>which was launched in San Francisco in 2014 and has been expanded to include Los 
</p>
<p>Angeles, Boston, New&nbsp;York, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and several European 
</p>
<p>cities. When they sign up for the service, users authorize their driver to pick up other 
</p>
<p>passengers on the way to their destination in exchange for a lower price. Uber 
</p>
<p>advertising claims that by sharing rides for a single month, LA residents using 
</p>
<p>UberPOOL cut potential carbon dioxide emissions by 41 metric tons and offset 
</p>
<p>154,000&nbsp;miles that might otherwise have been driven.47 Lyft operates a competing 
</p>
<p>carpool service called Lyft Line.
</p>
<p>Uber co-founder Kalanick has said UberPOOL is not as profitable for the com-
</p>
<p>pany as its regular service, but it is the direction Uber wants to take. He said the 
</p>
<p>service has already become tremendously popular in San Francisco and, as it grows, 
</p>
<p>will gain efficiency and become even more attractive to riders. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll no longer 
</p>
<p>have parking problems in San Francisco, no longer traffic congestion... and you also

</p>
<p>But until recently, neither Uber nor Lyft has released internal data that would 
</p>
<p>allow independent researchers to assess their impact on the environment, such as the 
</p>
<p>number and length of rides and the miles driven by drivers.
</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of California Berkeley&rsquo;s Transportation Sustainability

<p>Research Center have announced they will team up with the Natural Resources Defense

<p>Council (NRDC) to analyse the environmental impacts of Uber and Lyft. They plan to

<p>conduct their own passenger surveys and use internal ridership data, which Uber and Lyft 
</p>
<p>have promised to release. &ldquo;The pace of growth of these companies, which didn&rsquo;t exist just 
</p>
<p>a few years ago, is exponential,&rdquo; wrote Amanda Eakin, a deputy director of the NRDC. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In San Francisco, 25% of residents say they have used Uber or Lyft at least once in the

<p>review of motor vehicle and criminal records. It adds that its user review system 
</p>
<p>enhances the safety of passengers by allowing them to preview drivers&rsquo; reputations.50
</p>
<p>Yet its Terms and Conditions specify that Uber is merely a technology platform 
</p>
<p>which links passengers with third-party transportation providers and states &ldquo;the 
</p>
<p>entire risk&rdquo; of using the service lies with the user.51
</p>
<p>From the six-year-old girl who was run over and killed by a San Francisco Uber 
</p>
<p>driver, to the woman in New Delhi who was allegedly raped by an Uber driver, the 
</p>
<p>question of who is responsible for safety repeatedly arises:
</p>
<p>&bull; The family of six-year-old Sophia Liu was crossing a street in San Francisco on 
</p>
<p>New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2013, when an Uber driver making a right turn struck the group&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>killing the girl and injuring her brother and sister. The family sued Uber, saying 
</p>
<p>the driver was using the app to search for riders at the time of the accident, but 
</p>
<p>the company argued it was not responsible because the driver didn&rsquo;t have a pas-
</p>
<p>senger in the car at the time. Uber eventually settled out of court with the family, 
</p>
<p>with no ruling on who held responsibility. Uber has since added some insurance 
</p>
<p>coverage for drivers who are not yet carrying passengers.
</p>
<p>&bull; The capital of India temporarily banned Uber after a woman alleged she was 
</p>
<p>raped by an Uber driver in December 2014. Uber used its technology to help 
</p>
<p>New Delhi police identify and arrest the driver. The woman filed charges in a US 
</p>
<p>court, alleging that Uber failed to screen its drivers properly and the service 
</p>
<p>amounted to modern-day electronic hitchhiking. Uber responded that she was 
</p>
<p>suing the wrong party, as the driver had a contract with Uber BV, a Netherlands-
</p>
<p>based entity with no US operations. The woman dropped the case without expla-
</p>
<p>nation in 2015.52
</p>
<p>&bull; In San Francisco, an Uber driver was arrested for hitting a passenger in the face 
</p>
<p>with a hammer in 2014, after the passenger argued about directions. The passen-
</p>
<p>ger suffered serious eye injuries. Uber said its insurance company was talking to 
</p>
<p>the victim. Critics said the case pointed to a lack of driver screening and 
</p>
<p>training.53
</p>
<p>&bull; In Houston, Texas, an Uber driver was arrested for allegedly taking a drunken 
</p>
<p>woman to his home and raping her. It turned out the driver was an ex-con who 
</p>
<p>had spent 14&nbsp;years in prison on drug charges before being released in 2012,54 but

<p>he had passed Uber&rsquo;s background checks. He was also driving without a required

<p>city permit, which would have involved him passing an FBI fingerprint screen-

<p>ing. At the time Uber was not enforcing the city&rsquo;s requirement that drivers have 
</p>
<p>permits.55
</p>
<p>Uber&rsquo;s Terms and Conditions that users agree to (to sign up for the Uber app) 
</p>
<p>explain that Uber &ldquo;does not guarantee the quality, suitability, safety or ability of 
</p>
<p>third party providers (i.e. its drivers.) You agree that the entire risk arising out of 
</p>
<p>your use of the services&hellip;remains solely with you.&rdquo;56 Drivers who sign up online 
</p>
<p>are expected to carry their own insurance and take care of required permits and 
</p>
<p>inspections required by the city where they work.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Uber has upped the amount of commercial insurance it carries to

<p>cover liability of its drivers to $1 million. It touts its driver screening process&nbsp; &ndash; 
</p>
<p>online background checks conducted by an outside firm that looks at court records, 
</p>
<p>criminal databases and motor vehicles records. Uber requires a vehicle inspection 
</p>
<p>before drivers can start work57 and charges a $1 safety fee on every ride to pay for 
</p>
<p>these services. &ldquo;Safety is our top priority and foundational to the Uber experience&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>for both riders and drivers&nbsp;&ndash; and we take any potential breach of safety seriously,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>said an Uber spokesman after the hammer assault incident.58
</p>
<p>The district attorneys of Los Angeles and San Francisco filed a lawsuit charging 
</p>
<p>Uber with misleading customers about the safety of its services, alleging systemic 
</p>
<p>failures in Uber&rsquo;s background checks, which have allowed convicted sex offenders, 
</p>
<p>identity thieves, burglars, kidnappers and a murderer to drive for Uber.59 It said 
</p>
<p>Uber&rsquo;s record checks are not as good as the fingerprint checks required of most taxi 
</p>
<p>drivers. Uber responded that the system used to vet taxi drivers also misses previous 
</p>
<p>convictions and other red flags.

<p>Exhibit 27.13 A discontinued Uber safety ad
</p>
<p>An article in The Atlantic noted that, while reports of assaults in Uber cabs have 
</p>
<p>gained a lot of publicity, there are no reliable statistics to show whether assaults in 
</p>
<p>cars dispatched by ride-hailing apps are any more common than such problems in 
</p>
<p>taxicabs. Cities don&rsquo;t keep track of where assaults occur, the article noted.60 It 
</p>
<p>quoted Uber spokesman Taylor Bennett saying that 10% of Boston taxi drivers who 
</p>
<p>underwent background checks for Uber failed the test. &ldquo;Unlike the taxi industry, our 
</p>
<p>background checking process and standards are consistent across the United States 
</p>
<p>and often more rigorous than what is required to become a taxi driver,&rdquo; said Bennett, 
</p>
<p>who said Uber used a company called HireEase to do all its background checks.61
</p>
<p>Since the suit by the California district attorneys, Uber has removed advertising 
</p>
<p>that claims its background checks are &ldquo;industry leading.&rdquo;62 California state legisla-
</p>
<p>tors tried to pass a bill that would require fingerprinting for all transportation drivers

<p>in the state, but the legislation failed after Uber and other ride-sharing companies 
</p>
<p>lobbied ferociously against it.
</p>
<p>Uber has touted numerous ways that its services make cities safer, claiming its 
</p>
<p>services keep drunken drivers off the road by providing easy-to-access transporta-
</p>
<p>tion when bars close, so people who have been drinking have no need to drive. Since 
</p>
<p>all transactions occur through the customers&rsquo; credit card accounts and no money 
</p>
<p>changes hands, Uber says its system avoids the problem taxi drivers face of being 
</p>
<p>robbed of their cash. &ldquo;I work events late at night and with Uber I feel safer knowing 
</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to go wait outside and hope I can flag down a cab,&rdquo; said a Portland Uber 
</p>
<p>user, quoted in one of the company&rsquo;s safety promotions.63

</p>
<p>given to employees.
</p>
<p>The number of drivers working for Uber in the US went from almost none in 
</p>
<p>2012 to 160,000 by the end of 2014, according to a paper co-written by Jonathan 
</p>
<p>Hall, a researcher for Uber, and Alan Krueger, a professor of economics at 
</p>
<p>Princeton.65 In mid-2015, Uber CEO Kalanick said the company had 26,000 drivers 
</p>
<p>in New&nbsp;York City alone; 15,000&nbsp; in London; 22,000&nbsp; in San Francisco; 10,000&nbsp; in 
</p>
<p>Paris; and 20,000&nbsp;in Chengdu, China.66
</p>
<p>An Uber driver survey cited in Hall and Krueger&rsquo;s paper indicated that drivers 
</p>
<p>tend to be younger and much more educated than taxi drivers. The survey of 601 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;driver-partners&rdquo; in 20 US markets found that Uber drivers were more likely to be 
</p>
<p>women (still only 14%) and more likely to identify themselves as non-Hispanic 
</p>
<p>whites (40%) than those in the taxi profession.67
</p>
<p>Most Uber drivers (61%) had another part-time or full-time job. Half of all driv-
</p>
<p>ers had not worked in the transportation industry before joining Uber. 8% percent 
</p>
<p>were unemployed just before they started driving for Uber. 87% of drivers said one 
</p>
<p>of their reasons for joining Uber was &ldquo;to be my own boss and set my own schedule.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Half worked less than 15&nbsp;hours per week and 86% worked less than 35&nbsp;hours.68
</p>
<p>Since most Uber drivers had not been recently unemployed and many said they 
</p>
<p>liked being their own bosses, Krueger and Hall concluded: &ldquo;Most driver-partners do 
</p>
<p>not turn to Uber out of desperation or because they face an absence of other oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities in the job market, but rather because the nature of the work, the flexibility, 
</p>
<p>and the compensation appeals to them.&rdquo;69
</p>
<p>Krueger and Hall queried Uber&rsquo;s internal data, which showed that during a month 
</p>
<p>at the end of 2014, 162,000 drivers made at least four trips for Uber, and during the 
</p>
<p>last three months of 2014 Uber paid out $656.8 million to US drivers. The data 
</p>
<p>showed that in 2014, drivers made between $16 and $30 an hour depending on the 
</p>
<p>city they drove in. The hourly rates cited in the study did not include the drivers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>costs of gasoline, insurance and the expense of owning their own cars. Some Uber 
</p>
<p>drivers claim that, after paying these expenses, they didn&rsquo;t make the minimum 
</p>
<p>wage. Drivers have sued Uber in London, demanding to be guaranteed basic worker 
</p>
<p>protections like the minimum wage and regular breaks.70

</p>
<p>In California, Uber has lost some key labour decisions. The state Labour 
</p>
<p>Commission ruled that a San Francisco woman who drove for Uber for eight weeks, 
</p>
<p>and claimed not to have made minimum wage, was indeed an employee. The com-
</p>
<p>missioner ordered Uber to pay her $4152.20 expenses and other reimbursements.71 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants hold themselves out as nothing more than a neutral technological 
</p>
<p>platform, designed simply to enable drivers and passengers to transact the business 
</p>
<p>of transportation,&rdquo; the Labour Commissioner&rsquo;s Office wrote about Uber. &ldquo;The real-
</p>
<p>ity, however, is that the defendants are involved in every aspect of the operation.&rdquo;72
</p>
<p>While this case applies to only one worker, a bigger case, which seeks employee 
</p>
<p>status for the entire class of Uber drivers in California, is working its way through 
</p>
<p>the US court system. Scheduled for a jury trial in the District Court of California in 
</p>
<p>the summer of 2016, this could have major implications for all on-demand economy 
</p>
<p>companies that rely on workers who choose which jobs they take and set their own 
</p>
<p>schedules. By deeming them &ldquo;independent contractors&rdquo;, Uber is not liable for pay-
</p>
<p>ing drivers&rsquo; gas and vehicle maintenance expenses, minimum hourly wages and 
</p>
<p>benefits. Using contractors instead of employees allows Uber and other companies 
</p>
<p>to keep their labour and capital costs low, while tapping into a huge pool of drivers 
</p>
<p>and other workers who perform services around the globe.
</p>
<p>In the above case, filed on behalf of three named drivers, the claimants argue that 
</p>
<p>Uber imposes a &ldquo;litany of detailed requirements&rdquo; on its drivers and can terminate 
</p>
<p>them for failure to comply. They also argue that despite Uber&rsquo;s claim that it is a 
</p>
<p>technology platform not a transportation company, providing car services is Uber&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>main business. Thus, they say, drivers are integral to its service (a legal indication 
</p>
<p>that they should be classified as employees.)
</p>
<p>The lawsuit&rsquo;s backers won a series of victories near the end of 2015, when the 
</p>
<p>federal judge overseeing the case ruled that as many as 160,000 drivers who had 
</p>
<p>worked for Uber in California were eligible to join the case. The court also entitled 
</p>
<p>some of them to seek reimbursement of 57.5 cents per mile for their vehicle 
</p>
<p>expenses. Uber is appealing against the ruling.
</p>
<p>Uber argues that forcing it to classify drivers as employees would hurt its drivers 
</p>
<p>the most. &ldquo;Nearly 90 percent of drivers say the main reason they use Uber is because 
</p>
<p>they love being their own boss,&rdquo; the company said. &ldquo;Drivers use Uber on their own 
</p>
<p>terms; they control their use of the app along with where and when they drive.&rdquo;73
</p>
<p>Several other on-demand companies are facing similar lawsuits demanding 
</p>
<p>employee protection for workers. Uber&rsquo;s competitor Lyft settled a similar class- 
</p>
<p>action lawsuit in January 2016, agreeing to pay $12.25 million to drivers. The com-
</p>
<p>pany also vowed to change the terms that drivers agree to when they sign up for the

</p>
<p>service to make them more consistent with their status as contractors. One change, 
</p>
<p>according to the attorney who brought the suit, is that Lyft will no longer be able to 
</p>
<p>terminate drivers at will.74
</p>
<p>The company Homejoy, which used contractors to provide house-cleaning ser-
</p>
<p>vices, abruptly shut down in summer of 2015 after being targeted by similar suits.75 
</p>
<p>Instacart, which provides shopping and delivery services, changed some of its 
</p>
<p>workers to employees following a similar lawsuit. Postmates and Caviar, both deliv-
</p>
<p>ery services, and Handy, which provides cleaners and household repair experts, 
</p>
<p>have also faced lawsuits.
</p>
<p>Economists and labour activists have raised the question of whether sharing 
</p>
<p>economy companies are fuelling a shift in which traditional jobs are being replaced 
</p>
<p>by short-term &ldquo;independent contractor&rdquo; gigs.

<p>Many worry that this new &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo; might not be a good thing for either

<p>workers or the economy.

</p>
<p>Berkeley.76 &ldquo;At worst, it is a nightmare. Obviously some workers prefer to be inde-
</p>
<p>pendent contractors&nbsp;&mdash; but mostly they take these jobs because they cannot find 
</p>
<p>better ones.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Others argue that the on-demand economy represents a powerful new economic 
</p>
<p>opportunity for individual entrepreneurs who maybe don&rsquo;t fit into either the cate-
</p>
<p>gory of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; or &ldquo;independent contractor.&rdquo; &ldquo;The jury in this case will be 
</p>
<p>handed a square peg and asked to choose between two round holes,&rdquo; California 
</p>
<p>Judge Vince Chhabria wrote in a case concerning Lyft in 2015. &ldquo;The test the 
</p>
<p>California courts have developed over the 20th century for classifying workers isn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>very helpful in addressing this 21st-century problem.&rdquo;77 Some, including Krueger, 
</p>
<p>have proposed creating a new worker classification that meets the needs of the new 
</p>
<p>online economy and provides more protection for workers. Some suggest calling 
</p>
<p>these new workers &ldquo;dependent contractors&rdquo;.78
</p>
<p>Depending on how these questions are decided, Uber&rsquo;s model for hiring indepen-
</p>
<p>dent contractors could end up dramatically changing the world of work. &ldquo;The Uber 
</p>
<p>question is part of a bigger one facing the global economy,&rdquo; writes John Gapper of 
</p>
<p>the Financial Times.79 &ldquo;More and more people work for virtual platforms instead of 
</p>
<p>companies; work is auctioned to pools of contractors; median wages stagnate while 
</p>
<p>returns on capital rise; some duties of doctors and lawyers may soon be done by 
</p>
<p>machines. Is this what we want?&rdquo;
</p>
<p> Conclusion
</p>
<p>The question of how to regulate Uber and other sharing economy companies has 
</p>
<p>rocketed up the agendas of the world&rsquo;s highest-ranking governing agencies and 
</p>
<p>become a major political debate.
</p>
<p>The EU Court of Justice has been asked to rule on whether Uber should have to 
</p>
<p>comply with laws pertaining to local transportation companies in EU member 
</p>
<p>states, after a Spanish court ruled that Uber violated national law and amounted to 
</p>
<p>unfair competition with taxis. The European Commission is considering whether to 
</p>
<p>regulate ridesharing on a European level, rather than leaving it to local jurisdictions. 
</p>

<p>Part VI
</p>
<p>Introduction: Managing Change: Developing 
Dynamic Capabilities and Managerial Talents
</p>
<p>Gilbert&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Lenssen 
</p>
<p>Michael Porter pays little attention to the organizational and leadership prerequi-
</p>
<p>sites that need to underpin strategy implementation. He failed to do so in his classi-
</p>
<p>cal work on competitive strategy and also his work on Shared Value gives scant 
</p>
<p>attention to these prerequisites. More broadly, Porter&rsquo;s industry sector based theory 
</p>
<p>of competitive differentiation may not be able to reveal the dominant logic of value 
</p>
<p>capture in most new industries. This dominant logic is now recognized to be the way 
</p>
<p>businesses develop core resources that are unique, rare, difficult to imitate, and by 
</p>
<p>definition take a long time to grow and materialize. This is the resource- based view 
</p>
<p>of the business as the source of sustained advantage, developed by Jay Barney, a 
</p>
<p>strategy professor at Ohio State University. Core resources are Knowledge, 
</p>
<p>Relationships, Capabilities and Business Purpose. &ldquo;Business Purpose&rdquo; as a strategic 
</p>
<p>resource is a concept I explored with Robert Grant, a strategy professor at Bocconi 
</p>
<p>University Milan. Our hypothesis is that one of the main reasons that the share-
</p>
<p>holder value movement had such detrimental effects on business was its disregard 
</p>
<p>of business purpose as the cohesive binding commitments that sustain a business in 
</p>
<p>the long term. We need to make this &ldquo;hard&rdquo; by more research. Stakeholders are of 
</p>
<p>course key in generating strategic resources like knowledge, relationships and busi-
</p>
<p>ness purpose.
</p>
<p>A further strategic resource is capability, more specifically &ldquo;Dynamic Capability&rdquo;, 
</p>
<p>as identified by David Teece, building on the work by Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad. It 
</p>
<p>is defined as the capability of the firm to purposefully creating, extending and modify-
</p>
<p>ing the resource base of the business, by building, integrating and reconfiguring inter-
</p>
<p>nal and external competences to respond to rapidly changing environments and 
</p>
<p>contexts. The challenge of sustainable development requires a shift in the dynamic 
</p>
<p>capabilities of firms and it is beginning to show as we have explored in Part V.
</p>
<p>Dynamic capabilities of the organisation depend on the development of new 
</p>
<p>managerial talents. In the field of sustainable business, these seem to be grasping of 
</p>
<p>the context, embracing complexity, and maintaining connectedness in the business 
</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>610
</p>
<p>&bull; Grasping Context requires understanding macro trends, understanding eco-
</p>
<p>nomic, political, and cultural globalisation processes, sensing maturity stages of 
</p>
<p>issues, and scenario building. It presupposes intellectual curiosity and a rather 
</p>
<p>eclectic mindset.
</p>
<p>&bull; Embracing Complexity requires a deep awareness of systemic interdependen-
</p>
<p>cies, the ability to thrive in conditions of ambiguity, uncertainty and low agree-
</p>
<p>ment, and to act on emerging processes. It presupposes emotional intelligence, 
</p>
<p>fast learning loops, comfort with the unknown, and mindfulness.
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintaining Connectedness requires empathic engagement with multiple actors, 
</p>
<p>building effective professional and social networks, and an ability to forge 
</p>
<p>groundbreaking partnerships. It presupposes a capability for self awareness, 
</p>
<p>deep dialogue, and boundary spanning in order to generate legitimacy and trust.
</p>
<p>This will be elaborated on by Marc Jones and Matthew Gitsham in the Chaps. 28 
</p>
<p>and 31.

</p>
<p>and Strategic Management&rdquo;. Strategic Management Journal. 18 (7): 509&ndash;533.
</p>
<p>Key Questions to Ask (Applicable to All Part VI Cases)
</p>
<p>How are the business knowledge, relationships, capabilities and purpose developed 
</p>
<p>for a sustainable future?
</p>
<p>Which dynamic capabilities will be required for innovation?
</p>
<p>What organisational structures and processes are required to support a shift to a 
</p>
<p>sustainable enterprise model?
</p>
<p>What kind of leadership, decision-making and managerial frameworks would sup-
</p>
<p>port this?
</p>
<p>What are the implications for talent development and HRM, strategy development and 
</p>
<p>implementation, performance management, organisational change management?
</p>
<p>Chapter 28: Taking the Future Seriously: Preparing for Global Gigatrends by 
</p>
<p>Marc T.&nbsp;Jones
</p>
<p>In a similar vein to the authors of Chap. 6, Marc Jones lists the following giga 
</p>
<p>trends: climate change, energy depletion, the rise of the emerging economies, demo-
</p>
<p>graphic shifts, fiscal crises, threats to the democratic state and the emergence of the 
</p>
<p>permanent &ldquo;crisis state&rdquo;. He demonstrates how these trends are intertwined and 
</p>
<p>reinforce each other. The implications for executive education may amount to a 
</p>
<p>paradigm shift in cognitive and social skills development. The conventional ways to 
</p>
<p>analyse the larger business context are no longer adequate. Single leaders cannot 
</p>
<p>provide the capacity to grasp the complexity of the business context and horizons at 
</p>
<p>an abstract level, connect with the merging issues at the grassroots level, and design 
</p>
<p>strategies to keep business on a sustainable footing. Intensive teamwork and net-
</p>
<p>working will need to be fostered in executive education.

<p>Chapter 29: Unilever&rsquo;s Super Stretch Goal for 2020 by Aileen Ionescu-Somers 
</p>
<p>and Jacqueline Brassey
</p>
<p>In Chap. 21, Unilever&rsquo;s Sustainable Living Plan strategy was presented as an out-
</p>
<p>wardly ambitious if not iconoclastic attempt to decouple growth from negative 
</p>
<p>impacts and instead to couple it to social and progress. In this chapter, the authors 
</p>
<p>go deeper into the organisational characteristics and requirements of this strategy 
</p>
<p>and the change management in relation to organisational structure, systems, pro-
</p>
<p>cesses and culture that is required, without which Unilever&rsquo;s ambitious goals cannot 
</p>
<p>be achieved. From the outset, the HR department was seen as being at the centre of 
</p>
<p>strategy delivery by developing the managerial talents and getting the requisite 
</p>
<p>managerial profiles on board. Organisationally, the hardware reconfiguration 
</p>
<p>required new performance metrics and new core decision-making and business pro-
</p>
<p>cesses. The software reconfiguration required leadership alignment on the sustain-
</p>
<p>ability strategy reaching to the middle management levels, which are crucial for 
</p>
<p>consistent and streamlined implementation. &ldquo;Winning hearts and minds&rdquo; at all 
</p>
<p>organisational levels and in all regions of the world was seen as imperative, with 
</p>
<p>experiential learning as a useful tool in achieving this. In a nutshell, the challenge is 
</p>
<p>very simple, yet very difficult: how can the product managers of 250 branded prod-
</p>
<p>ucts, who care about market share, product performance, brand performance, profit-
</p>
<p>ability, and return, equally care about reducing environmental footprints and 
</p>
<p>enhancing social performance? The jury is still out as to whether the SLP will be 
</p>
<p>viewed as a brilliantly conceived business strategy that ultimately failed because 
</p>
<p>organisational alignment proved to be to insufficient; or whether it becomes a show-
</p>
<p>case for organisational change management and talent development for a 
</p>
<p>sustainability- led strategic transformation. The stakes are huge for Paul Polman and 
</p>
<p>the company alike.
</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Novo Nordisk A/S: Integrating Sustainability into Business 
</p>
<p>Practices by Mette Morsing, Dennis Oswald, and Susanne Stormer
</p>
<p>This case offers an in-depth analysis of the organisational and management pro-
</p>
<p>cesses implemented by Novo Nordisk to underpin its sustainability strategy in a 
</p>
<p>successful way. These processes are based on a vision and on values and commit-
</p>
<p>ments for financial, environmental and social responsibility. The company recog-
</p>
<p>nised through a number of controversies that the health care and pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>sector has a huge impact on society and is very sensitive to social issues and politi-
</p>
<p>cal backlashes in developed and in developing markets. Therefore, it needs the 
</p>
<p>organisational built-in assurances that its business is conducted consistent with and 
</p>
<p>as integral to its sustainability strategy. If sustainability is integral to business strat-
</p>
<p>egy, it needs to be integral to business operations in a consistent way, which can be 
</p>
<p>monitored systematically. This is the Novo Nordisk Way of Management. A key 
</p>
<p>management process is built around a cascading balanced scorecard integrating sus-
</p>
<p>tainability KPI&rsquo;s with financial and operational objectives at all organisational lev-
</p>
<p>els. The management reporting process is based on the &ldquo;triple bottom line&rdquo; model, 
</p>
<p>reporting financial, environmental and social performance concurrently, both

</p>
<p>internally and externally. Internal consultants or &ldquo;facilitators&rdquo; who audit operational 
</p>
<p>units on meeting sustainability targets, provide on-site consulting and identify and 
</p>
<p>communicate best practices to support continuous improvement.
</p>
<p>Chapter 31: The Changing Role of Business Leaders and Implications for 
</p>
<p>Talent Management and Executive Education by Matthew Gitsham
</p>
<p>This book contains a number of success stories of companies like IBM, Unilever, 
</p>
<p>Umicore, Novo Nordisk, General Electric, and illy. They all have a few characteris-
</p>
<p>tics in common. First, their CEOs and top leadership are inspiring and committed to 
</p>
<p>making their companies a force for good. They consider themselves public leaders 
</p>
<p>instead of merely executive administrators. These leaders take a long term view and 
</p>
<p>are committed to delivering value to shareholders and other stakeholders. The finan-
</p>
<p>cial performance of their companies has been stable and above average in the indus-
</p>
<p>try sector over time. Second, these companies excel in human resource and talent 
</p>
<p>development and maintain high quality processes in recruitment, training and devel-
</p>
<p>opment, career progression, organisational learning, and networking. As a conse-
</p>
<p>quence, they are able to attract the best talent available. Third, they are keeping a 
</p>
<p>broad economic, social and political perspective in strategic processes and encour-
</p>
<p>age intellectual curiosity and literacy beyond the traditional boundaries of business. 
</p>
<p>Fourth, they are committed to continuous innovation by setting ambitious targets for 
</p>
<p>business renewal from the top and allowing for experiments in the margins to 
</p>
<p>encourage bottom up and lateral creativity. Fifth, they grasp sustainability issues as 
</p>
<p>opportunities for profitable business investment growth, and business model trans-
</p>
<p>formations. In keeping with these observations, this chapter goes deeper into the 
</p>
<p>requirements for new leadership and new talent for sustainable business.

<p>28Taking the&nbsp;Future Seriously: Preparing for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Global Gigatrends
Marc&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Jones
</p>
<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>Mohamed El Erian (recently retired CEO of Pimco) is credited with the observation 
</p>
<p>that for the foreseeable future investment decisions will be taken in a context of the 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;new normal&rsquo;, characterised by much higher levels of economic (and political, 
</p>
<p>social, etc.) instability and uncertainty than was evident in past decades. The funda-
</p>
<p>mental question, then, is what are the key trends shaping the business landscape 
</p>
<p>going forward? Our answer to this question is the gigatrends.
</p>
<p>Included among the gigatrends is climate change; energy depletion; the rise of 
</p>
<p>the BRIC nations; profound demographic shifts driven by both the genome revolu-
</p>
<p>tion, widely divergent birth rates across countries, and the rise of a new middle class 
</p>
<p>in the global South; the fiscal crisis that will embroil nearly all &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; states in 
</p>
<p>coming years; and the possibility that we are within sight of an end to substantive 
</p>
<p>democracy and its replacement with a permanent &lsquo;crisis state&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>At the organisational level, each of these gigatrends will require some form of 
</p>
<p>effective response in order to realise latent opportunities and/or mitigate looming 
</p>
<p>threats. A much greater challenge, of course, is that these gigatrends will not unfold 
</p>
<p>in isolation of each other, but rather in complex and largely unpredictable interac-
</p>
<p>tions. Yet corporate actors are not only passive bystanders to these developments, 
</p>
<p>but also in many instances active shapers of market, industry, and sector evolution 
</p>
<p>operating at various geographical levels. An understanding of the gigatrends also 
</p>
<p>needs to be incorporated within executive education interventions to foster more 
</p>
<p>ethical, enlightened and effective future leaders.
</p>
<p>Yet the gigatrends, while already each in train, also constitute a collective meta-
</p>
<p>phor on the future. More specifically, they challenge organisations to reflect upon 
</p>
<p>how seriously they take the future; the meaning of &lsquo;the long-term&rsquo; in context; and </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>the extent to which conversations about the long-term eventuate in decisions which 
</p>
<p>drive resource commitments today. The gigatrends provoke senior leadership to 
</p>
<p>clarify its strategic posture (Courtney 1998)&nbsp;&ndash; the manner in which it interacts with 
</p>
<p>its ecosystem&nbsp;&ndash; which in turn has implications for the organisational &lsquo;muscles&rsquo; it 
</p>
<p>will invest in to best realise the chosen posture of industry shaper, fast (or more cau-
</p>
<p>tious) follower, or committed bystander.
</p>
<p> The Global Gigatrends
</p>
<p>The first and preeminent gigatrend facing not only economic actors but the entire 
</p>
<p>biosphere is that of climate change. The overwhelming judgement of the scientific 
</p>
<p>community is that global warming is a fact, and that human industrial activity (based 
</p>
<p>on burning fossil fuels) is a major contributor to the process (Hamilton 2010; IPCC 
</p>
<p>2008; Stern 2007). Sea levels are already on the rise, fostering &ldquo;climate refugees&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Klein 2007); weather patterns appear increasingly unstable in comparison to his-
</p>
<p>torical norms, undermining agricultural productivity; and recent estimates of tem-
</p>
<p>perature increases suggest we are approaching a &lsquo;tipping point&rsquo; which could be 
</p>
<p>sufficient to trigger positive feedback loops which will drive runaway temperature 
</p>
<p>increases in a catastrophe scenario (Guardian 2009a). Scientists from the Global 
</p>
<p>Carbon Project state that the most likely scenario is for a 6 degree (Fahrenheit) rise 
</p>
<p>by 2100, due to the manifestation of feedback loops through the failure of natural 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;carbon sinks&rsquo; to absorb greenhouse gas emissions, which increased 29% over the 
</p>
<p>2000&ndash;2008 period (Independent 2009). More recently the National Climate 
</p>
<p>Assessment report issued by the United States government in 2014 confirmed cli-
</p>
<p>mate change as a &lsquo;clear and present danger&rsquo; to national security (USGCRP 2014).
</p>
<p>The fundamental point here is that there is actually very little (serious) debate 
</p>
<p>that global temperatures (and, consequently, sea levels) are rising. The key uncer-
</p>
<p>tainties concern the rate of warming and the point at which temperatures will peak. 
</p>
<p>The policy debate circles around whether to concentrate attention and resources 
</p>
<p>around containing and mitigating carbon emissions, or accommodating to living in 
</p>
<p>a warmed world. A salient point here would be to consider that humanity has proven 
</p>
<p>able to exist and function effectively, in a reasonable degree of comfort, in such 
</p>
<p>extreme climates as northern Alaska or the Antarctic in winter as well as Dallas or 
</p>
<p>Dubai in summer. Humanity has been able to survive in prosper under highly 
</p>
<p>adverse climactic conditions due to the existence of effective heating and cooling 
</p>
<p>technologies fuelled by abundant and affordable energy resources. This period of 
</p>
<p>human history is quite possibly coming to an end, with epochal implications for 
</p>
<p>contemporary techo-industrial civilisation (Greer 2008). This is why the next giga-
</p>
<p>trend is the most significant of all.
</p>
<p>The second gigatrend is that of continuing (and accelerating) energy depletion. 
</p>
<p>Up until very recently, the relevant science indicated that we were at or near the 
</p>
<p>point in time in which known global petroleum reserves exceed consumed reserves 
</p>
<p>(the definition of &lsquo;peak oil&rsquo;), meaning we were in the early stages of an extended 
</p>
<p>decline in which first oil, then other fossil fuel (coal and natural gas) reserves will

<p>be run down to minimal levels (Guardian 2009b). In this scenario, alternative energy 
</p>
<p>sources and technologies (e.g., geothermal, hydro, solar) would not be sufficient to 
</p>
<p>offset the energy deficit left by fossil fuels because their net energy yield&nbsp;&ndash; the dif-
</p>
<p>ference between the amount of energy one unit of a substance generates and the 
</p>
<p>energy that has been expended in producing it&nbsp;&ndash; is only a fraction of that typical of 
</p>
<p>fossil fuels (Heinberg 2005).
</p>
<p>However, the &lsquo;fracking revolution&rsquo; now well underway in the USA considerably 
</p>
<p>changes this equation, pushing &lsquo;peak oil&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash; which the IEA had has recently as 2011 
</p>
<p>identified as occurring in 2006&nbsp;&ndash; back some years, potentially even decades. As long 
</p>
<p>as oil prices remain in the $100/barrel range, it will be economic to exploit shale oil 
</p>
<p>and other forms of &lsquo;tight oil&rsquo;. The real danger, it seems, isn&rsquo;t that there isn&rsquo;t enough 
</p>
<p>oil, but that there will be too much! This will undermine the development of clean 
</p>
<p>alternatives, vastly increase the release of carbon into the atmosphere, and thereby 
</p>
<p>possibly catalyse runaway climate change (Carbon Tracker 2013).
</p>
<p>Since industrial (and post-industrial) economies are based fundamentally on an 
</p>
<p>ample supply of cheap energy from fossil fuels, the ramifications of energy deple-
</p>
<p>tion are totalising&nbsp; &ndash; think, for example, of the rapidly rising levels of electricity 
</p>
<p>needed to power Google&rsquo;s servers!1 Unless there occurs an as yet unforeseen tech-
</p>
<p>nological breakthrough which leads to some alternative energy source taking up the 
</p>
<p>slack as affordable fossil fuel stocks wind down, the type of civilisation which 
</p>
<p>developed in Western Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century, 
</p>
<p>extending itself throughout most of the world in the twentieth century, will be liter-
</p>
<p>ally unsustainable. That is, available energy resources will not be able to generate 
</p>
<p>levels of electrical and other forms of cheap energy necessary to power the built 
</p>
<p>environments and transportation grids integral to an advanced technological 
</p>
<p>civilisation.
</p>
<p>The third gigatrend driving large scale structural change in the world is the rise 
</p>
<p>of the so-called &lsquo;BRIC&rsquo; nations and the consequent (at least relative) decline of the 
</p>
<p>West (and Japan) in terms of their role and status in the global economy. Inevitably, 
</p>
<p>with rising economic power also comes political clout&nbsp;&ndash; witness the recent morph-
</p>
<p>ing of the G-8 into the G-20 as the world&rsquo;s most important international forum on 
</p>
<p>economic affairs, along with China&rsquo;s major role in scuppering the 2010 climate 
</p>
<p>negotiations in Copenhagen (Lynas 2010). Perhaps most significant from a longer- 
</p>
<p>term perspective, however, will be the eroding value of the Western narrative of 
</p>
<p>development through markets and democracy so celebrated in the &lsquo;end of history&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>thesis (Fukuyama 1992) and manifested in the neoliberal policies of the Washington 
</p>
<p>Consensus (see Panitch and Konigs 2009).
</p>
<p>The extent to which the Western development model has been discredited should 
</p>
<p>not be underestimated. Some observers trace a growing conflict regarding the global 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;rules of the road&rsquo; back at least to the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 
</p>
<p>(Aglietta and Berribi 2007). Conversations within key international institutions 
</p>
<p>going forward will likely take on a much more pluralistic tone where multiple 
</p>
<p>1 On a global basis, servers are currently estimated to account for 2% of all energy consumption, a 
number expected to grow dramatically in coming years (BBC 2013).

</p>
<p>varieties of capitalism with differing roles for market, state and democracy will 
</p>
<p>compete for policy influence over the institutional architecture of the global system. 
</p>
<p>The BRIC nations can also be expected to compete with the West for access to key 
</p>
<p>global resources such as energy, strategic minerals and arable land (see Klare 2012), 
</p>
<p>a contest which is already evident in the neo-colonial &lsquo;race for Africa&rsquo; between 
</p>
<p>China and the United States (Financial Times 2010). Significant here is the fact that 
</p>
<p>for China and many other emerging nations the benchmark development model is 
</p>
<p>not the United States or Western Europe, but rather Singapore. With its effective 
</p>
<p>mix of strong state, political stability, attenuated democracy, and social &lsquo;harmony&rsquo;, 
</p>
<p>the success of Singapore puts into question the robustness of the Western formula-
</p>
<p>tion of democratic-capitalism as the modal institutional framework for developing 
</p>
<p>countries (see Kagan 2009).
</p>
<p>The fourth gigatrend impacting future history relates to massive demographic 
</p>
<p>changes driven by biotechnology, birth rates, and migration patterns. We are on the 
</p>
<p>brink of the genome revolution, which will foster a wide range of life extension 
</p>
<p>technologies. While some scientists believe that we are within reach of living up to 
</p>
<p>1000&nbsp; years (c.f., de Grey 2008), more widely held opinions expect a significant 
</p>
<p>percentage of children born today to experience life spans considerably in excess of 
</p>
<p>100&nbsp;years (Fukuyama 2003). Yet technological possibilities need to take into account 
</p>
<p>political, social and cultural factors. The impacts on superannuation systems, labour 
</p>
<p>markets and occupational structures are only the most obvious areas of disruption, 
</p>
<p>but there are even more fundamental issues at stake.
</p>
<p>The most starkly apparent characteristic of the genome revolution&nbsp;&ndash; in great con-
</p>
<p>trast to the &lsquo;open-sourced&rsquo; spread of the internet&nbsp;&ndash; is that it is unfolding in an over-
</p>
<p>whelmingly privatised organisational field composed of research labs (often 
</p>
<p>spin-offs from public universities), biotech and pharmaceutical firms, medical 
</p>
<p>equipment manufacturers, healthcare delivery providers (hospitals and clinics), 
</p>
<p>insurance companies, and regulatory agencies. The trajectory of technological 
</p>
<p>development and commercialisation of basic research will likely mean a profound 
</p>
<p>skewness in the direction of treating those illnesses (e.g., diabetes, obesity) that 
</p>
<p>afflict relatively well off citizens/customers in wealthy countries, rather than deal-
</p>
<p>ing with age-old maladies (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria) which torment hundreds of 
</p>
<p>millions of poor people across the globe because, after all, a functioning market 
</p>
<p>requires not only that a demand exists but that potential customers have the means 
</p>
<p>to make payment. As noted by John Sulston, who led the UK branch of the Human 
</p>
<p>Genome Project, &ldquo;The fact of the matter is that many human genes have patent 
</p>
<p>rights on them and this is going to get in the way of treatment unless you have a lot 
</p>
<p>of money&rdquo; (Guardian 2010). This unequal access to life preserving and extending 
</p>
<p>technologies for the global minority, while the global majority may well experience 
</p>
<p>shortening life spans as the ravages of climate change and energy depletion under-
</p>
<p>mine states&rsquo; ability to fund public health initiatives (Cecchetti et&nbsp;al. 2010; Greer 
</p>
<p>2008), raises issues of natural justice which clash directly with the &lsquo;ethics&rsquo; of prop-
</p>
<p>erty rights. The bottom line here is that in a world of vastly unbalanced life chances 
</p>
<p>due to chronic inequality, it is entirely likely that only those who can afford it will 
</p>
<p>get to live longer&nbsp;&ndash; that is, just like today, only MUCH more so.
</p>

</p>
<p>Another important aspect of demographic change is the rise of massive megaci-
</p>
<p>ties in the South and the related shift of purchasing power to the &lsquo;second tier&rsquo; cities 
</p>
<p>of emerging market economies, particularly China. Foreign Policy (2006) noted that 
</p>
<p>by 2015 almost all of the 21 global megacities will be in developing countries 
</p>
<p>(Tokyo and Seoul are the only exceptions) and will be wracked by pollution, inad-
</p>
<p>equate services, and crime. Observing these trends and linking urbanisation and age 
</p>
<p>demographics, Magnus (2010) poses the question of whether key developing nations 
</p>
<p>(most notably China) will &lsquo;get old before they get rich&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Significantly, the &lsquo;southern&rsquo; megacities&rsquo; unfolding development represents a 
</p>
<p>reversal of the classical (and functional) labour-intensive countryside/capital- 
</p>
<p>intensive industrial metropolis couplet. We now witness capital-intensive hinter-
</p>
<p>lands and burgeoning deindustrialised cities with shrinking formal economies, with 
</p>
<p>few linkages between the two save for a one-way flow of urban migration. Davis 
</p>
<p>(2007) attributes this urban influx to contemporary &lsquo;enclosure&rsquo; measures aimed to 
</p>
<p>open up formally subsistence acreage for agro-industrial production of specialised 
</p>
<p>crops for export. He explores the linkages between global neoliberalism, the increas-
</p>
<p>ing urbanization of world poverty, and the rise of a &lsquo;surplus humanity&rsquo; which is 
</p>
<p>excluded from formal networks of production and exchange, forced to survive by 
</p>
<p>any means necessary in the midst of increasing resource scarcity and environmental 
</p>
<p>degradation.
</p>
<p>Significantly, although they capture the imaginations of both optimistic and dys-
</p>
<p>topian observers, it will not be the megacities that drive global economic develop-
</p>
<p>ment in the future. This at least according to a report by McKinsey (2012) which 
</p>
<p>identified the &lsquo;second-tier&rsquo; cities of emerging markets as the primary hubs of eco-
</p>
<p>nomic growth over the next few decades. This report notes that 80% of global GDP 
</p>
<p>growth to 2030 will come from cities, with 600 second-tier cities (mostly in China) 
</p>
<p>to account for 3/4 of all urban growth. By 2025 most middle class consumers will 
</p>
<p>be located in emerging market cities, signaling a permanent shift in focus for the 
</p>
<p>global giants of the B2C industries. Given that the axis of global growth is tilting 
</p>
<p>increasingly to the emerging world, is it not inevitable that an increasing portion of 
</p>
<p>global firms&rsquo; key corporate functions and activities eventually follow the same path-
</p>
<p>way? The implications of this shift for the capability profiles of future corporate 
</p>
<p>leaders&nbsp; &ndash; and, consequently, executive development programs&nbsp; &ndash; are clearly 
</p>
<p>profound.
</p>
<p>The final gigatrend, impacting nearly all &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; countries, concerns the fis-
</p>
<p>cal crisis of the state. It is universally acknowledged that the Global Financial Crisis 
</p>
<p>(GFC) wreaked havoc with the accounts of most OECD nations as governments 
</p>
<p>came to the rescue of their banking systems, using public funds to bail out private 
</p>
<p>interests. Yet the dislocations following from the GFC pales in comparison to 
</p>
<p>longer- term financial challenges. In seminal research, Cecchetti et&nbsp;al. (2010) exam-
</p>
<p>ined the unfunded liabilities in health and welfare of OECD member countries to 
</p>
<p>the year 2040. The results were staggering: under the condition of maintaining cur-
</p>
<p>rent levels of service provision, ALL states would effectively be bankrupted by the 
</p>
<p>impacts of aging populations, shrinking tax bases (as fewer income earners were 
</p>
<p>required to support more retirees), and rising per capita health care costs. The 
</p>
<p>28 Taking the&nbsp;Future Seriously: Preparing for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Global Gigatrends</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>618
</p>
<p>magnitude of these impacts was far greater than that of the GFC.&nbsp;The primary con-
</p>
<p>clusion of this research was that it would be inevitable that governments would have 
</p>
<p>to renegotiate the &lsquo;social compact&rsquo; with their citizens (possibly unilaterally) wherein 
</p>
<p>which retirement ages increased substantially and state provision for public health 
</p>
<p>and welfare was downscaled dramatically&nbsp;&ndash; with the consequent rise of &lsquo;user-pays&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>regimes to replace what had been public goods. Piketty&rsquo;s (2014) recent landmark 
</p>
<p>analysis of contemporary capitalism offers insights which are fully consistent with 
</p>
<p>the trends outlined above.
</p>
<p>The pending fiscal &lsquo;train wreck&rsquo; outlined above is even more alarming when we 
</p>
<p>consider how this gigatrend might interact with others (e.g., climate change), almost 
</p>
<p>inevitably in ways which will put increasing strains on public purses. This crisis of 
</p>
<p>the state could easily lead to an institutionalization of a permanent &lsquo;state of crisis&rsquo;, 
</p>
<p>which incorporates the enshrining of democracy as a normative ideal while formally 
</p>
<p>embedding anti-democratic &lsquo;technocratic&rsquo; regimes under serially renewing emer-
</p>
<p>gency legislation. Such a &lsquo;state of exception&rsquo; situation was observed and theorised 
</p>
<p>in Weimer Germany in the 1920s by Carl Schmitt (Teschke 2011). One could also 
</p>
<p>argue that this is essentially characterises how the key allied powers functioned dur-
</p>
<p>ing the existential crisis of World War 2.
</p>
<p>As a bankrupted state withdraws from many sectors of society and renegotiates 
</p>
<p>the &lsquo;social compact&rsquo; with citizens over the manner in which rights and responsibili-
</p>
<p>ties are to be allocated, the private corporation will be increasingly called upon to 
</p>
<p>provide for the legal, economic and civil rights of individuals. To some extent this 
</p>
<p>process is already underway. For example, the European Group for Organisation 
</p>
<p>Studies (2009) observed that
</p>
<p>Today, many multinational business firms have started to voluntarily regulate their activities 
or produce global public goods. As the widespread participation in the UN Global Compact 
shows, these firms assume political responsibilities that once were regarded as belonging to 
government. They contribute to public health, education, social security, and the protection 
of human rights, or engage in self-regulation to fill gaps in legal regulation and to promote 
societal peace and stability.
</p>
<p>Matten and Crane (2005) have explored the empirical conditions under which the 
</p>
<p>corporation might be expected to engage in administering the political, legal and 
</p>
<p>civil rights of citizens. This expanded corporate role is depicted as filling an institu-
</p>
<p>tional vacuum resulting from the withdrawal (or complete absence) of the state from 
</p>
<p>significant areas in society. While it seems inevitable that corporations will become 
</p>
<p>more fully involved with the societies in which they operate&nbsp;&ndash; whether by inclina-
</p>
<p>tion or necessity&nbsp;&ndash; Fleming and Jones (2012) articulate at length the many dangers 
</p>
<p>that such elevated engagement entails for the future of democracy.

</p>
<p> Interactions
</p>
<p>We could speculate endlessly on the potential interactions between various giga-
</p>
<p>trends; such an exercise is practically best conducted from the perspective of a spe-
</p>
<p>cific organisation, industry or business ecosystem. Here we will briefly discuss two 
</p>
<p>of the most obviously important interactions which will impact a wide spectrum of 
</p>
<p>sectors and industries.
</p>
<p>The gigatrends associated with climate, resources and development are, to a 
</p>
<p>greater or lesser extent, interlocking. For example, clearly there is a direct causal 
</p>
<p>connection between the globalisation of capitalism and ever-increasing levels of 
</p>
<p>production, consumption and waste as societies transition from subsistence to con-
</p>
<p>sumerist orientations. While the immediate environmental impacts of this economic 
</p>
<p>activity have shifted in recent decades from the North to Asia and parts of the South 
</p>
<p>as Western and Japanese TNCs have restructured their supply chains (Dicken 2011), 
</p>
<p>the aggregate amount of environmental degradation continues to increase with the 
</p>
<p>volume of industrial activity, despite improvements in productivity which allow 
</p>
<p>more outputs from fewer inputs.
</p>
<p>The key gigatrend interaction, however, is that between climate change and 
</p>
<p>energy depletion. This interaction is all about carbon in the sense that the burning of 
</p>
<p>carbon-based fossil fuels drives global warming, while the challenges of dealing 
</p>
<p>with the latter require increasingly elaborate and energy intensive technological 
</p>
<p>solutions (most obviously desalination plants), most of which are powered by elec-
</p>
<p>tricity. Of course the vast majority of electricity is generated by the burning of fossil 
</p>
<p>fuels (primarily coal and natural gas), so the destructive cycle continues.
</p>
<p>A challenge for democratic countries going forward will be their structural dis-
</p>
<p>advantage in dealing with the long-term challenges of climate change and energy 
</p>
<p>depletion due to their preoccupation with short electoral cycles and reliance on mar-
</p>
<p>ket forces, both of which tend to discount the future heavily. It may well be, then, 
</p>
<p>that only some form of authoritarian-capitalism (i.e., the Singapore model) has any 
</p>
<p>hope of surviving the twenty-first century and dealing effectively with the 
</p>
<p>gigatrends.
</p>
<p>For example, the increasing incidence of &lsquo;climate refugees&rsquo; may well also drive 
</p>
<p>the institutionalisation of de facto authoritarian-capitalist regimes (justified through 
</p>
<p>narratives based on &lsquo;law and order&rsquo;, &lsquo;border control&rsquo; and the like) throughout most 
</p>
<p>of the democratic-capitalist West over the next few decades as fears of &lsquo;barbarians 
</p>
<p>at the gates&rsquo; intensify. Such a development would likely amplify the &lsquo;weaponising&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>of urban space noted by Sassen (2006), as police and private security organisations 
</p>
<p>expand to cope with the challenges of internal security and border control in check 
</p>
<p>so that key flows of people, goods and information can continue to interact in a 
</p>
<p>functional manner.

<p>620
</p>
<p> The Gigatrends and&nbsp;Executive Education
</p>
<p>Findings from some significant recent leadership research indicate that, compared 
</p>
<p>with the generation that preceded them, future business leaders will require a differ-
</p>
<p>ent general outlook and understanding of the role and purpose of their organisations 
</p>
<p>in society. They will need to employ a range of leadership approaches to deal with 
</p>
<p>a new range of issues. This, in turn, will entail the development of new leadership 
</p>
<p>capabilities.
</p>
<p>Following a particularly germane report by Ashridge (2011), we can understand 
</p>
<p>these developmental areas in terms of capabilities to manage context, complexity, 
</p>
<p>and connectedness. According to this research, the global leader of tomorrow needs 
</p>
<p>to understand the changing business context&nbsp;&ndash; the business risks and opportunities 
</p>
<p>of social, political, cultural and environmental trends. They will need to know how 
</p>
<p>their sector and other actors (regulators, customers, suppliers, investors, NGOs) are 
</p>
<p>responding to events and trends. These leaders will need to be able to factor social 
</p>
<p>and environmental trends into their strategic choices.
</p>
<p>The second cluster of knowledge and skills is around the ability to lead in the 
</p>
<p>face of increasing complexity and ambiguity. The challenges and opportunities that 
</p>
<p>these issues and trends present are by definition complex&nbsp;&ndash; there is often little cer-
</p>
<p>tainty or agreement both about their precise nature and the response that is required. 
</p>
<p>Leadership in these circumstances requires a range of discrete skills, including the 
</p>
<p>ability to be flexible and responsive to change; the ability to find creative, innovative 
</p>
<p>and original ways of solving problems; the ability to learn from mistakes; and the 
</p>
<p>ability to balance shorter and longer-term considerations. Future leaders will also be 
</p>
<p>required to understand the interdependency of actions and the range of global impli-
</p>
<p>cations that local level decisions can have, as well as the ethical basis on which 
</p>
<p>business decisions will be made.
</p>
<p>The final cluster of knowledge and skills is around connectedness&nbsp;&ndash; the ability to 
</p>
<p>understand the actors in the wider political landscape and to engage and build effec-
</p>
<p>tive relationships with new kinds of external partners. For different businesses this 
</p>
<p>can mean regulators, competitors, NGOs and/or local communities. The mindset 
</p>
<p>with which current leaders are groomed does not encourage productive engagement 
</p>
<p>with partners outside the organisation. For example, leaders receive plenty of train-
</p>
<p>ing in negotiation skills, but on the whole lack the skills for engaging in effective 
</p>
<p>dialogue and partnerships. To survive and thrive, the global leader of tomorrow 
</p>
<p>needs to be able to identify key stakeholders that have an influence on the organisa-
</p>
<p>tion, understanding at the same time how the organisation impacts on these stake-
</p>
<p>holders. Senior executives will need to engage in effective dialogue in order to build 
</p>
<p>productive partnerships with internal and external stakeholders.
</p>
<p>The previous insights are largely echoed in a report by HayGroup (2011), which 
</p>
<p>argues that the strategic thinking and cognitive skills leaders will need to navigate a 
</p>
<p>gigatrend world are unprecedented. The task is so enormous that it is beyond the 
</p>
<p>power of one single individual to accomplish, making collaboration among a range 
</p>
<p>of different people and perspective essential even at the stage of conceptualising 
</p>
<p>challenges. As well as being multilingual, flexible, internationally mobile and 
</p>
<p>M. T. Jones</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>621
</p>
<p>adaptable, and culturally sensitive, future leaders will also have to be collaborative 
</p>
<p>and good conceptual and contextual thinkers. They will need outstanding cognitive 
</p>
<p>skills to balance the competing demands of financial success, social responsibility 
</p>
<p>and environmental custodianship. Leaders must also act as change agents, advocat-
</p>
<p>ing environmentally responsible business practice within and outside their organisa-
</p>
<p>tions, forging new levels of intra-and inter-company collaboration in order to 
</p>
<p>encourage shared solutions.
</p>
<p>Clearly, this suggests that executive development programs will accordingly 
</p>
<p>need to evolve their content and structure to foster leaders who are not only techni-
</p>
<p>cally competent, but also emotionally intelligent, ecosystem conscious, and com-
</p>
<p>fortable making rapid strategic decisions under highly uncertain conditions. 
</p>
<p>Intensive experiential exercises which foster team building under pressurised condi-
</p>
<p>tions clearly have a prominent role here. In terms of content, a &lsquo;return&rsquo; to the 
</p>
<p>humanities and social sciences may be in order, supplanting (for more senior execu-
</p>
<p>tives at least) foundational and genuinely research-based disciplinary knowledge 
</p>
<p>for the more mechanical content typical of business functions (marking, strategy, 
</p>
<p>etc.). A third inclusion would be to incorporate genuine dialogic conversations 
</p>
<p>(Bohm 2004) into program structures in order to promote a mutual understanding of 
</p>
<p>the parameters of reality attached to individuals within each unique executive 
</p>
<p>cohort. This dialogic understanding could then be practically applied by program 
</p>
<p>graduates by treating organisational boundaries within their relevant ecosystems as 
</p>
<p>highly permeable, thus enabling effective communication between ecosystem mem-
</p>
<p>bers to promote understanding, learning, and, ultimately, genuine sustainability.
</p>
<p> Discussion Questions
</p>
<p> 1. How do the concepts of organisational agility and resilience relate to the global 
</p>
<p>gigatrends?
</p>
<p> 2. What are some outstanding examples of companies which are already acting in 
</p>
<p>ways which exploit some of the business opportunities created by the 
</p>
<p>gigatrends?
</p>
<p> 3. Identify some companies and sectors which seem most vulnerable to the unfold-
</p>
<p>ing gigatrends.
</p>
<p> 4. Discuss the potential contradictions between short-term pressures from the 
</p>
<p>financial markets and the type of long-term resource commitments necessary for 
</p>
<p>organisations to position themselves advantageously with respect to the 
</p>
<p>gigatrends.
</p>
<p> 5. Based on your understanding of the gigatrends and their interactions, create an 
</p>
<p>investment portfolio for a hypothetical 30-year trust fund.

<p>29Unilever&rsquo;s Super Stretch Goal for&nbsp;2020
Aileen M.&nbsp;Ionescu-Somers and&nbsp;Jacqueline&nbsp;Brassey
</p>
<p>1 February 2011: Let&rsquo;s zoom in on a cold, crisp, blue-skied day in central London, 
</p>
<p>to an impressive neoclassical art-deco style office building overlooking the Thames: 
</p>
<p>Unilever House. Appearances are deceptive. Proceeding through the doors, flanked 
</p>
<p>by heavy ionic pillars, visitors and employees enter a thoroughly modern glass- 
</p>
<p>fitted atrium that allows light and color to pervade the building on multiple stories. 
</p>
<p>The building symbolizes the evolution of the historically patriarchal soap-making 
</p>
<p>company, Lever Brothers, into Unilever in 1930, around which time Unilever House 
</p>
<p>was built as the UK base of this Anglo-Dutch fast-moving consumer goods giant. In 
</p>
<p>this millennium, the company has carefully honed a new and shiny modern image 
</p>
<p>in tune with successes and challenges of the twenty-first century.
</p>
<p>A conversation in a top-floor office also reflected new realities. Paul Polman, 
</p>
<p>CEO of Unilever since 2009, was briefing Douglas (Doug) Baillie on his first day as 
</p>
<p>Unilever&rsquo;s new chief human resources officer (CHRO). In November 2010 the com-
</p>
<p>pany had set out the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (the USLP), committing to a 
</p>
<p>10-year journey toward sustainable growth as the organization&rsquo;s core strategy. This 
</p>
<p>meant doubling its growth to &euro;80 billion while greatly reducing its negative environ-
</p>
<p>mental and social impacts.
</p>
<p>Baillie was not new to Unilever, a company in an industry that stood out for the 
</p>
<p>career longevity of senior executives within firms. A marketing and sales executive 
</p>
<p>by training, he had been with the company for 35&nbsp;years, in multiple posts, including 
</p>
<p>managing transformational change in post-apartheid South Africa. Polman looked 
</p>
<p>keenly at Baillie:</p>

</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, Doug. For me the talent and leadership agenda is a key component for the 
</p>
<p>USLP&rsquo;s strategic success. Question is: Can HR be ahead of the business, laying the road 
</p>
<p>before we arrive on our growth trajectory&hellip;or will it be&nbsp;&ndash; as HR departments are prone to 
</p>
<p>be&nbsp;&ndash; behind it, filling in the cracks? To be successful, we need to be &ldquo;ahead of the posse&rdquo; at 
</p>
<p>every level. HR&rsquo;s role is crucial. That is our&nbsp;&ndash; and your&nbsp;&ndash; challenge.
</p>
<p> Polman: Aiming to&nbsp;Buck the&nbsp;Mega-trends
</p>
<p>On 1 January 2009, Paul Polman succeeded Patrick Cescau as CEO of Unilever. 
</p>
<p>Polman was hired &ldquo;from the outside,&rdquo; a somewhat unusual move in a company 
</p>
<p>better known for promoting its own executives to senior positions from the 
</p>
<p>inside. Polman had previously worked as chief financial officer and executive 
</p>
<p>vice president for the Americas at Nestl&eacute; and had also held positions at Procter 
</p>
<p>&amp; Gamble and other companies.
</p>
<p>Polman was a man with a mission. He had strong beliefs about the role of busi-
</p>
<p>ness in a resource-restricted world pervaded with social inequity. He had deeply 
</p>
<p>reflected on global megatrends and their implications for business as well as for the 
</p>
<p>planet and humanity. Having worked in industries dependent on natural resources 
</p>
<p>and social equity for growth, he had witnessed a marked shift from abundance to 
</p>
<p>increased scarcity in the course of his career.
</p>
<p>He knew the world&rsquo;s population would reach a landmark seven billion by 2011, 
</p>
<p>and over two billion more people would inhabit the planet by 2050. This was both a 
</p>
<p>risk and an opportunity for Unilever. The growth and aging of world populations 
</p>
<p>had increased the strain on natural resources and social welfare systems. Polman 
</p>
<p>had long realized that this had implications for driving future growth and improve-
</p>
<p>ments to quality of life upon which his company had built its business model. People 
</p>
<p>had become more mobile, which fueled urbanization. Some 70&nbsp;% of people were 
</p>
<p>expected to live in urban areas by 2050, which meant that they would be increas-
</p>
<p>ingly dependent on companies like Unilever for their food and personal care prod-
</p>
<p>ucts. However, these shifts&nbsp;&ndash; particularly in emerging and developing economies 
</p>
<p>such as China and India&nbsp;&ndash; were increasing the demand for water, food, minerals, 
</p>
<p>metal, agricultural land and energy. This also meant an increasing waste problem, 
</p>
<p>deforestation, soil degradation through inefficient agricultural methods and linked 
</p>
<p>threats to habitats and biodiversity worldwide.1
</p>
<p>From an economic standpoint, Polman was convinced that political and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic systems were failing and that capitalism needed to be reframed for the com-
</p>
<p>mon good. His view was that too many companies had prospered at the expense of 
</p>
<p>society and nature, and that companies had a business imperative to be successful 
</p>
<p>while giving back to society and supporting ecosystems and biodiversity. He felt 
</p>
<p>that the writing was on the wall for what he called a &ldquo;new kind of capitalism&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>Whilst he supported management incentives that encouraged a longer-term focus, a 
</p>
<p>broader form of stakeholder driven capitalism, and stronger and better-informed

</p>
<p>boards of directors, he also believed that these shifts alone would not be sufficient 
</p>
<p>for transformational change:
</p>
<p>Changes in policy will mean little if not accompanied by changes in behavior. That&rsquo;s why 
</p>
<p>we need a different approach to business&nbsp;&ndash; a new model led by a generation of leaders with 
</p>
<p>the mind-set and the courage to tackle the challenges of the future.2
</p>
<p>Polman also felt that companies failing to respond to the obvious social and envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental challenges of the modern era risked going out of business. He spoke 
</p>
<p>eloquently about what he termed a VUCA3 world, one that had become more 
</p>
<p>Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous:
</p>
<p>We have increasing income disparity within the developed world. We have a political sys-
</p>
<p>tem that barely functions after the economic and financial crisis. So continuing the way we 
</p>
<p>are going is simply not a solution. Increasingly consumers are asking for a different way of 
</p>
<p>doing business and building society for the long term together.4
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Full Steam Ahead!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Following the maxim &ldquo;start as you mean to go on,&rdquo; Polman took some controver-
</p>
<p>sial first steps as Unilever&rsquo;s CEO.&nbsp;Exasperated by the short-term perspective dic-
</p>
<p>tated by what he termed &ldquo;Wall Street,&rdquo; in 2009 he abolished earnings guidance and 
</p>
<p>quarterly reporting for investors, and was vocal about the fact that short-term ori-
</p>
<p>ented hedge funds, for example, were not the company&rsquo;s most welcome investors. 
</p>
<p>These were ambitious moves that created shock waves in the global press at a time 
</p>
<p>when the banking and finance industry was under increasing scrutiny because of 
</p>
<p>multiple scandals and scams.
</p>
<p>Then, in 2010, he launched an ambitious plan to double revenue to &euro;80 billion 
</p>
<p>while halving the company&rsquo;s environmental footprint and increasing positive social 
</p>
<p>impacts considerably over the same period. This was not the first time that Unilever 
</p>
<p>had set itself an ambitious objective. In 1997, in partnership with the conservation 
</p>
<p>organization WWF, Unilever had created the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) 
</p>
<p>and committed to source 100&nbsp;% of its fish from sustainable, certified fisheries by 
</p>
<p>2005. In fact, by 2005 it had reached only 70&nbsp;% of the overall goal. However, it had 
</p>
<p>been a bold and effective move, which set the MSC on a trajectory that would see 
</p>
<p>some of the world&rsquo;s biggest retailers, such as Walmart, agree to include MSC prod-
</p>
<p>ucts in their product mixes. Unilever later sold its fish business but the 
</p>

3 The concept of a VUCA world&nbsp;&ndash; one that is volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous&nbsp;&ndash; was 
</p>
<p>introduced by the US military as the Cold War ended and as the United States looked out over the 
</p>
<p>emergence of a multilateral, rather than a bilateral, global landscape. The VUCA concept gained 
</p>
<p>currency in the private sector with the onset of the financial crisis in 2008/09, when companies and 
</p>
<p>organizations all over the world suddenly found themselves faced with turbulence in their business 
</p>
<p>environments and, subsequently, in their business models.

</p>
<p>company-specific goal that it had achieved went way beyond what any other com-
</p>
<p>pany had ever done. Even then, executives at the company felt that setting the stretch 
</p>
<p>goals had been a highly effective way of accelerating innovation and aggressive 
</p>
<p>target setting within the organization.
</p>
<p> At the&nbsp;Helm of&nbsp;a&nbsp;New Strategy: The&nbsp;Unilever Compass
</p>
<p>Like any new CEO, Polman wanted to define a fresh vision and purpose for the 
</p>
<p>company, a vision that would act as a beacon to the strategy. He was determined 
</p>
<p>that ongoing pressures&nbsp;&ndash; economic, social and environmental&nbsp;&ndash; would frame the 
</p>
<p>approach to Unilever&rsquo;s core business strategy and model. The Unilever Compass 
</p>
<p>(see text box below) was born. It was a concise summary that set the course to lead 
</p>
<p>Unilever closer to a long-term visionary business perspective. It outlined an ambi-
</p>
<p>tious vision and purpose and defined four so called &ldquo;winning with&rdquo; pillars that 
</p>
<p>would leverage profitable volume growth, stimulate innovation and create efficien-
</p>
<p>cies.5 They were: (1) winning with brands and innovation; (2) winning in the mar-
</p>
<p>ket place; (3) winning through continuous improvement; and, finally, (4) winning 
</p>
<p>with people (Fig.&nbsp;29.1).

</p>
<p> The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP)
</p>
<p>Now, what Unilever needed was the development of a robust business model to back 
</p>
<p>up the pillars. In November 2010, the company set out its Unilever Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Living Plan (the USLP), committing to a 10-year journey toward sustainable growth 
</p>
<p>by doubling growth, halving its environmental footprint and increasing positive 
</p>
<p>social impacts significantly (Fig.&nbsp;29.2).
</p>
<p>Our operations: On any given day two billion consumers use our products 
</p>
<p>and we want to reach many more, by developing innovative products that 
</p>
<p>address different consumer needs at different price points. To do this we use 
</p>
<p>our global scale to help deliver sustainable, profitable growth by seeking to 
</p>
<p>add value at every step in the value chain by enhancing product quality and 
</p>
<p>customer service, and rolling out innovations faster across all markets.
</p>
<p>Sustainable living: For us, sustainable, equitable growth is the only 
</p>
<p>acceptable business model. Business needs to be a regenerative force in the 
</p>
<p>system that gives it life. For example, by reducing waste, we create efficien-
</p>
<p>cies and reduce costs, helping to improve margins while reducing risk. 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, looking at more sustainable ways of developing products, sourc-
</p>
<p>ing and manufacturing opens up opportunities for innovation while improving 
</p>
<p>the livelihoods of our suppliers.
</p>
<p>Our brands: Strong brands and innovation are central to our ambition to 
</p>
<p>double in size. We are investing in brand equity, finding and strengthening the 
</p>
<p>connections between consumers and the products they buy. Where equity is 
</p>
<p>strong, we are leveraging it&nbsp;&ndash; creating efficiencies by focusing on fewer, big-
</p>
<p>ger projects that enhance margins. And we are seeking superior products 
</p>
<p>which consumers will prefer, driving profitable growth.
</p>
<p>Our people: Sustainable, profitable growth can only be achieved with the 
</p>
<p>right people working in an organization that is fit to win, with a culture in 
</p>
<p>which performance is aligned with values. We are increasingly an agile and 
</p>
<p>diverse business with people motivated by doing good while doing well. We 
</p>
<p>are building capability and leadership among our people and attracting some 
</p>
<p>of the best talent in the market place.
</p>
<p>29 Unilever&rsquo;s Super Stretch Goal for&nbsp;2020</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>628
</p>
<p>The strategic approach reached across the entire Unilever value chain. The com-
</p>
<p>pany proposed taking responsibility not just for its own direct operations but for its 
</p>
<p>suppliers, distributors and&nbsp;&ndash; crucially&nbsp;&ndash; for how its consumers were using its brands.6
</p>
<p>The ambitious goals sent shock waves throughout the company, and the strategy 
</p>
<p>attracted considerable interest from corporate stakeholders such as NGOs and sus-
</p>
<p>tainability &ldquo;think tanks&rdquo; which had recently struggled to convince companies to 
</p>
<p>move beyond the &ldquo;low-hanging fruits&rdquo; with their sustainability strategies. What&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>more, Paul Polman set off on a highly public campaign to advertise these goals. 
</p>
<p>Convinced that to achieve them, others would have to come on board, he embarked 
</p>
<p>on a virtual &ldquo;crusade&rdquo; to persuade governments, NGOs and other stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>help get policy instruments implemented to enable progress.
</p>
<p> A Navigation Challenge for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chief Sustainability Officer
</p>
<p>Gavin Neath, the CSO who had accompanied Unilever on many ambitious sustain-
</p>
<p>ability journeys, retired from Unilever in 2010. Gail Klintworth was recruited as his 
</p>
<p>successor. Klintworth was a South African with over 25&nbsp;years of experience with 
</p>
<p>varied challenges in human resources, sales and marketing, across Unilever&rsquo;s Foods, 
</p>
<p>Home Care and Personal Care businesses. She had a no-nonsense business head and 
</p>
<p>had achieved success as CEO of Unilever South Africa from 2007 to 2010, a time of 
</p>
<p>great social change in the country. Commenting on why she was selected to steer 
</p>
<p>this new challenge, Klintworth said:
</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is a change management challenge. I had already led large-scale 
</p>
<p>change within Unilever, plus I had a huge personal passion as well as a strong strategic 
</p>
<p>6 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8gMdGLTqPY
</p>
<p>The Unilever Sustainable 
Living Plan (USLP)
</p>
<p>The USLP will result in three 
significant outcomes.
</p>
<p>1. We will help more than a billion 
people take action to improve their 
health and well-being.
</p>
<p>2. We will decouple our growth from 
our environmental impact, achieving 
absolute reductions across the 
product lifecycle. Our goal is to halve 
the environmental footprint of the 
making and use of our products.
</p>
<p>3. We will enhance the livelihoods of 
hundreds of thousands of people in
</p>
<p>our supply chain.

</p>
<p>belief that this is a future we have to embrace. It was about the right time. The challenge 
</p>
<p>was now to embed sustainability into the core of the business.
</p>
<p>She went on to explain where this passion came from:
</p>
<p>I grew up in South Africa, during apartheid, and finished university as a strong believer that 
</p>
<p>things needed to be different. I played an active role in promoting the move to a different 
</p>
<p>society. After 1995 I took on Business Leadership South Africa, a joint private/public part-
</p>
<p>nership addressing some of the key issues that we needed to tackle to make the transition 
</p>
<p>from apartheid, autocratic society to more social equity. If you look at where we are today 
</p>
<p>against where it could have been, we have achieved a lot. I crafted the business to address 
</p>
<p>environmental issues and meet social needs since you simply have to make that part of the 
</p>
<p>business in South Africa. I was fortunate that I grew up in this space.
</p>
<p>Klintworth knew that the strategy had to be integrated throughout the company:
</p>
<p>I know that there are crucial units to bring on board with the strategy. However, the role of 
</p>
<p>the HR unit in driving such an ambitious change program is critical and is often what has 
</p>
<p>been missed in terms of driving through sustainable business issues. Because of this, we 
</p>
<p>miss opportunities related to people/human rights and change of behaviors and mindsets. 
</p>
<p>We need to bring that more on board now!
</p>
<p> Overhauling the&nbsp;Engines: The&nbsp;HR Mega-challenge
</p>
<p>After leaving Polman&rsquo;s office on that cold February day in 2011, Baillie remarked 
</p>
<p>to a senior colleague back at his own office:
</p>
<p>To ensure that HR is ahead of Unilever&rsquo;s growth ambition, there are three things that will 
</p>
<p>keep me awake at night: First, where am I going to find, grow, develop and keep the right 
</p>
<p>talent, in the right place, at the right time, to build a new Unilever? Second, linked to that, 
</p>
<p>as I look at the next 5 to 10&nbsp;years, what will leaders of Unilever look like in 2020? What are 
</p>
<p>the unique skills required to operate effectively in a VUCA world? What are the unique 
</p>
<p>competencies that are going to help executives a) manage that world and b) get competitive 
</p>
<p>advantage for Unilever within it? Third, how do I help evolve a performance culture that 
</p>
<p>truly drives inclusion, with the richness of full diversity in our business, to allow our leaders 
</p>
<p>to contribute fully to this new and integrated sustainable business agenda? That is our 
</p>
<p>opportunity, and my challenge.
</p>
<p> Case Analysis: What Shifts Culture in&nbsp;Corporate Organizations?
</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that shift cultures in organizations. One lever is lead-
</p>
<p>ership engagement; those who have engaged and are advocates at the leadership 
</p>
<p>level can drive the change and embed it as a way of thinking and operating.
</p>
<p>However, Unilever as an organization needed to explore the value systems and 
</p>
<p>characteristics of corporate culture to be put in place and/or reinforced to induce 
</p>
<p>leaders and managers to change and facilitate its USLP strategy implementation and 
</p>
<p>alignment. Baillie and his senior colleagues needed to get to the bottom of how 
</p>
<p>29 Unilever&rsquo;s Super Stretch Goal for&nbsp;2020</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>630
</p>
<p>Unilever could promote and enhance the optimum corporate culture and value sys-
</p>
<p>tems for USLP strategy alignment. Baillie himself, as senior HR officer, needed to 
</p>
<p>unlock the key to a new role for the human resources function, in recruitment/selec-
</p>
<p>tion, policy-making, training and in developing reward/recognition systems that 
</p>
<p>reinforce culture and value systems that best promote success with the USLP.
</p>
<p> New Expectations from&nbsp;Senior Human Resources Officers
</p>
<p>C- Suite roles can and should evolve over time in corporate organizations. Polman&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>conversation with Baillie was indicative of evolving new leadership expectations of 
</p>
<p>Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) in the VUCA world. It is increasingly 
</p>
<p>clear that CHROs will need more general management skills with broader business 
</p>
<p>perspectives than human resources management itself. The role will most probably 
</p>
<p>evolve towards more of a strategic leadership mindset. The reason for this is that 
</p>
<p>talent management, in a complex business context, in a complex world, will become 
</p>
<p>an instrument for business transformation. Optimally in the future, the CHRO will 
</p>
<p>be the &ldquo;chief change officer&rdquo; for his or her organization.
</p>
<p>For organizations that are advanced with their sustainability strategies&nbsp;&ndash; such as 
</p>
<p>Unilever&nbsp;&ndash; a CHRO could in the future replace many of the previous expectations of 
</p>
<p>a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). For example, HR can take a lead role in the 
</p>
<p>development of a culture to support delivery of any ambitious embedded sustain-
</p>
<p>ability driven strategy such as the USLP.&nbsp;Currently, few HR departments are set up 
</p>
<p>to take on this challenge.
</p>
<p>Any HR department can draw on various tools to diversify its approaches and 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;hardwire&rdquo; its involvement and perceived support in strategy delivery. First, they 
</p>
<p>can draw on defined principles (corporate values/principles) and frameworks that 
</p>
<p>executives can apply in real day-to-day life. Second, they can bring HR insight to 
</p>
<p>the types of skills and competencies that are needed to succeed in delivering sustain-
</p>
<p>ability objectives. Third, they can focus on defining the recruitment and induction or 
</p>
<p>training requirements to bring the right people on board. Fourth they can play a 
</p>
<p>significant role in developing ways of measuring performance more holistically 
</p>
<p>against broader strategic expectations and&nbsp;&ndash; in a closed loop system&nbsp;&ndash; ensuring that 
</p>
<p>such new criteria are incorporated in the selection of leaders for promotion.
</p>
<p>Paradoxically, many HR departments do not actually perceive that they have the 
</p>
<p>potential to play such an important strategic role. The result is that&nbsp;&ndash; instead&nbsp;- they 
</p>
<p>actually become a &ldquo;drag&rdquo; on the strategy, rather than promoting it and building 
</p>
<p>organizational capability to tackle the challenges head on. This mistaken perception 
</p>
<p>is a substantial barrier to change, as is the fact that HR departments are not neces-
</p>
<p>sarily equipped to take on these new tasks. Some large and global organizations 
</p>
<p>have skeletal teams that do not correspond to the immensity of the challenges of 
</p>
<p>shifting organizations to entirely new cultures and value systems and to new ways 
</p>
<p>and means of achieving objectives. Organizations have usually not have even 
</p>
<p>thought about how to empower their CHRO and HR department to bring expected 
</p>
<p>changes. And yet, whilst business unit leaders and ambassadors for the strategy 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>631
</p>
<p>throughout the corporation are catalyzers for action throughout organizations, the 
</p>
<p>HR department&rsquo;s role is as a crucial enabler.
</p>
<p> Getting the&nbsp;Requisite Managerial Profiles on&nbsp;Board
</p>
<p>Perhaps because of its historical evolution as a company, Unilever arguably had a 
</p>
<p>head start in terms of getting the right values in place to make the USLP a success. 
</p>
<p>Sustainability leadership had been a part of its &ldquo;corporate DNA&rdquo; for a very long 
</p>
<p>time. The long history of sustainability leadership and the existence of this corpo-
</p>
<p>rate DNA made Unilever one of the few companies capable of making sustainability 
</p>
<p>leadership an integrated part of the way it did business and be the market leader in 
</p>
<p>realizing the challenging goals it had set itself related to the triple bottom &ndash; line.
</p>
<p>But many companies do not have that advantage. The short term pressure that 
</p>
<p>companies are put under clashes with the longer term perspectives and goals 
</p>
<p>required for being successful with strategies such as the USLP.&nbsp;And even at Unilever, 
</p>
<p>there can be expectations gaps. By this we mean that there may be a general internal 
</p>
<p>nervousness about the fact that the external world has high expectations and that 
</p>
<p>these expectations might not be easily met internally. Although a light tension 
</p>
<p>between what is communicated and where a company is internally is healthy and 
</p>
<p>will challenge the company in the right direction&nbsp;&ndash; it is important to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>gap between expectations and realizations does not become too wide.
</p>
<p>Given its history, it is easy to take for granted even at Unilever that an implicit set 
</p>
<p>of values will convert into corporate action around the USLP.&nbsp;Whilst the &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>corporate DNA/culture may be very well understood by long-standing members of 
</p>
<p>staff, it still very definitely needs to be made much more &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; for all, but most 
</p>
<p>especially for new leaders coming on board. Changes in the business leading to 
</p>
<p>more throughput of senior managers may produce a shift in the corporate culture 
</p>
<p>that might eventually filter towards a stepping away from the company&rsquo;s traditional 
</p>
<p>values. To hardwire the corporate culture that will help achieve long term sustain-
</p>
<p>ability objectives, more explicitness will allow new leaders to unlock the corporate 
</p>
<p>code for sustainability leadership more quickly. Also&nbsp;&ndash; interestingly&nbsp;&ndash; this will help 
</p>
<p>to impede a potentially divisive &ldquo;them&rdquo; (longer term executives) vs &ldquo;us&rdquo; (new gen-
</p>
<p>eration managers) culture from emerging.
</p>
<p>Moreover, regional differences highlight the fact that in many areas a &lsquo;one-size- 
</p>
<p>fits-all&rsquo; approach is not relevant. Explicit regional differences at Unilever, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, relate to (a) talent availability and quality; (b) governmental involvement and 
</p>
<p>regulations; (c) skills and competencies maturity; and (d) market maturity related to 
</p>
<p>sustainability questions.

</p>
<p> Globally Relevant Opportunities for&nbsp;Change
</p>
<p>In considering the key opportunities for change when implementing an ambitious 
</p>
<p>sustainability strategy, five areas currently need most attention. Two of these relate 
</p>
<p>more to the &lsquo;hardware&rsquo; of the organization; two to the software and one opportunity 
</p>
<p>is right at the heart of both, as summarized in the model below (Fig.&nbsp;29.3):
</p>
<p>Software: Top Leadership Alignment
</p>
<p>By aligning top leadership on the organization&rsquo;s sustainability strategy, it becomes 
</p>
<p>possible for &ldquo;leading by example&rdquo; in a consistent way to take hold. This is a funda-
</p>
<p>mental requirement for the success of the strategy. Many managers hear ambitious 
</p>
<p>claims in speeches from &ldquo;the top&rdquo;, but never in their day to day discussions with 
</p>
<p>their direct reports where they are focusing on other topics; so called &ldquo;regular&rdquo; top-
</p>
<p>ics such as meeting bottom line objectives and optimizing prices and so on. A good 
</p>
<p>understanding of the &ldquo;dis-connects&rdquo; that exist within the organization on these 
</p>
<p>issues will be necessary in order to address and close them, and to establish more 
</p>
<p>cohesive leadership.
</p>
<p>Software: Winning Hearts and Minds
</p>
<p>Winning hearts and minds of executives within all managerial layers and all func-
</p>
<p>tional areas is increasingly not a &ldquo;given&rdquo;. There can be regional differences that 
</p>
<p>impede this from happening. Interestingly, senior executives at Unilever found that 
</p>
<p>talented managers from China or South Africa have either grown up with or been 
</p>
<p>exposed early in their careers to severe impacts of social and environmental issues 
</p>
<p>and are thus more likely to have (a) higher awareness than European or US managers 
</p>
<p>of their economic business relevance and (b) a greater passion and understanding of 
</p>
<p>the roadmap to implementing a strategic vision that addresses these very issues.
</p>
<p>To counter this, Unilever is increasingly looking at introducing experiential learn-
</p>
<p>ing programs. In fact, experiential learning will in future be an essential part of train-
</p>
<p>ing sustainability leaders, especially where those leaders have no explicit experience 
</p>
<p>on the ground of sustainability issues and impacts. Developing differentiated 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>633
</p>
<p>leadership training to respond to regional differences will also be required. To win all 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;hearts and minds&rdquo;, the senior leadership team will always be important role models. 
</p>
<p>Consistent communication, creation of sustainability &ldquo;champions&rdquo; or &ldquo;ambassadors&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>and best practice/success story sharing are also essential elements for success.
</p>
<p>Attracting and Developing (Top) Talent
</p>
<p>Many younger future executives aspire to having loftier purposes in their careers 
</p>
<p>than spending their time meeting shareholder value expectations. Those that make 
</p>
<p>up Generations X, Y, and increasingly Z will want to make a positive difference in 
</p>
<p>the world. Whilst these generations are increasingly aware of existing risks in areas 
</p>
<p>such as energy, food, health, water, and climate security, they are more likely than 
</p>
<p>the current generations of mid- to senior level executives to tackle those risks by 
</p>
<p>converting them to opportunities, applying entrepreneurship, achieving positive 
</p>
<p>impact and setting up collaborations.
</p>
<p>Attracting and retaining these types of people has a two-fold requirement. Firstly 
</p>
<p>it is about understanding and describing explicitly the right profiles for top talent of 
</p>
<p>the future. This needs to happen, not only on an organization-wide basis, but on a 
</p>
<p>function-specific basis&nbsp;&ndash; i.e. what does the profile of the marketing leader of the 
</p>
<p>future look like? Then, the organization needs to set about attracting and developing 
</p>
<p>key players for every part of the business. Next, it is about clarifying the necessary 
</p>
<p>skills and competency frameworks that will be needed to deliver the strategy. 
</p>
<p>Subsequently and naturally, it will then mean developing all employees in line with 
</p>
<p>these skills and competency profiles. As one Unilever senior executive put it:
</p>
<p>Where do I find the leaders and how can I develop them to be ideal leaders for Unilever in 
</p>
<p>2020? Where do I find the right people to strive in a world that has nothing to do today with 
</p>
<p>what it will be tomorrow? That is one of my challenges.
</p>
<p>Royal DSM, for example, has instigated a new way of engaging its younger employ-
</p>
<p>ees by launching DSM Next which now has regional hubs around the world. DSM 
</p>
<p>Next is a global network of more than a thousand young professionals that advances 
</p>
<p>professional development, the creation of a unique &ldquo;one DSM culture agenda&rdquo; and 
</p>
<p>sustainability. Through the hubs, young professionals are connected, learn about and 
</p>
<p>from each other, and can implement innovation projects that are related to sustain-
</p>
<p>ability and other value-adding themes. We do that by organizing social and business 
</p>
<p>related activities through our local hubs. We connect early career professionals inside 
</p>
<p>and outside DSM to learn about DSM and about each other. We provide a platform to 
</p>
<p>contribute the brainpower of our members to DSM, by allowing them to act on their 
</p>
<p>ideas and to start a project, for example in the areas of sustainability or innovation.
</p>
<p>Hardware: Performance Metrics and Management
</p>
<p>To be successful within the firm, sustainability must be perceived as an enabler of future 
</p>
<p>growth and profitability. So for Unilever, it is important to ask two questions. How does 
</p>
<p>the company define good sustainability performance in terms of business results? What 
</p>
<p>is the quality of these results and do they align with the purpose and values?
</p>
<p>29 Unilever&rsquo;s Super Stretch Goal for&nbsp;2020</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>634
</p>
<p>Getting performance metrics in place so as to integrate core themes of a strategy 
</p>
<p>within performance management systems so that they are driven forward is a crucial 
</p>
<p>part of the due diligence when it comes to embedding sustainability strategy. This 
</p>
<p>holds managers accountable for their actions and allows progress to be monitored 
</p>
<p>and evaluated properly. If this is ignored&nbsp;&ndash; as all too often it is&nbsp;&ndash; then cascading a 
</p>
<p>strategy throughout the organization is unlikely to be effective, and approaches will 
</p>
<p>remain slow and fragmented, and essentially non-strategic. It is also important that 
</p>
<p>internal communications ensure that there are no ambiguities, uncertainties or lack 
</p>
<p>of clarity about the systems in place. As senior leaders in Unilever pointed out:
</p>
<p>We need all parts of the organization&nbsp;&ndash; including crucial units such as marketing, 
</p>
<p>to have sustainability in their targets, against which managers are rewarded. And 
</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where HR will have an important persuading role. Reward is an important 
</p>
<p>driver of growth. Non-financial metrics related to brands, customer satisfaction and 
</p>
<p>so on must also be considered. We need to find the right ones that are meaningful 
</p>
<p>across the organizations.
</p>
<p>Hardware: Implementation in Decision: Making and Core Business Processes
</p>
<p>Alignment between strategic intent and decision-making as well as core business 
</p>
<p>processes will also support behavior and mindset change. Most companies are not 
</p>
<p>at all clear on how this can be done. There are standardized business processes in 
</p>
<p>most organizations that deserve a strategic &ldquo;revisit&rdquo; in order to align these processes 
</p>
<p>with strategic purpose. At Unilever also, there is broad agreement that longer-term 
</p>
<p>sustainability considerations need to be more embedded into decision-making pro-
</p>
<p>cesses through core internal systems. Interestingly, some executives saw it taking up 
</p>
<p>to 7&nbsp;years for this embedding to properly take hold within the company; they saw it 
</p>
<p>as that big a challenge. For example, marketers have an important role to play in the 
</p>
<p>strategic decision-making process for longer term considerations and yet it is diffi-
</p>
<p>cult to get them on board mainly because of hardwired business behaviors and ways 
</p>
<p>and means of attaining traditional objectives that have been honed and rewarded 
</p>
<p>handsomely over many generations.

<p>Attracting and Developing (Top) Talent
</p>
<p>Many younger future executives aspire to having loftier purposes in their careers

</p>
<p>Overall, organizations need to challenge the human resources community on 
</p>
<p>what their role is in trying to embed a purpose. In trying to embed strategic pur-
</p>
<p>pose when built around a sustainability driven vision and objectives, we will find 
</p>
<p>in the future that human resources will be an important enabler with a crucial 
</p>
<p>leadership mandate to ensure that culture and values align with the organizational 
</p>
<p>strategy. After all, when culture and strategy collide, there is only one winner 
</p>
<p>every time, and that is culture.

<p>The data for this case study was collected in 2005. Today, 10&nbsp;years later in 2015, some

<p>of the content of the systems (for example the KPIs) and the persons (for example Eric

</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk remain. Instead of re-writing the case from 2005, we decided to pro-
</p>
<p>duce an epilogue that provides the reader with an update on some of the important 
</p>
<p>areas that have influenced the way that Novo Nordisk works. We hope that the epi-
</p>
<p>logue anno 2015 will further stimulate discussions in the class room&nbsp;&ndash; and beyond&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>about integration of sustainability into the organization and how such integration is 
</p>
<p>never a &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; that is done once-and-for-all, but an ongoing and dynamic

<p>process that needs careful managerial attention and development over time.</p>

<p> Introduction
</p>
<p>We all have a vision of how we&rsquo;d like the world to be. For a company like Novo Nordisk 
</p>
<p>committed to sustainable development, that vision is one of trust, openness, shared values 
</p>
<p>and partnerships. We translate that as the Triple Bottom Line&nbsp;&ndash; social and environmental 
</p>
<p>responsibility and economic viability. In an age where companies are scrutinised and 
</p>
<p> transparency is the only way to gain trust, social responsibility is vital to maintain a 
</p>
<p>business advantage. CEO Lars Rebien S&oslash;rensen, Novo Nordisk.1
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk is an excellent example of an organisation that attempts to consider 
</p>
<p>sustainability as an integrated part of its strategy and in all of its business decisions. 
</p>
<p>To meet this goal, the company has adopted a management philosophy which 
</p>
<p>they call the &lsquo;Novo Nordisk Way of Management&rsquo; to ensure all actions taken by 
</p>
<p>employees meet corporate objectives. Within this management tool are three pillars 
</p>
<p>that are used as control mechanisms to integrate sustainability into Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>business practices: facilitators, sustainability report, and the balanced scorecard. 
</p>
<p>However, it is not certain to what extent each of these pillars is effective in influenc-
</p>
<p>ing behaviour at the operational level.
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk defines sustainable development as being about preserving the 
</p>
<p>planet while improving the quality of life for its current and future inhabitants. 
</p>
<p>From a business perspective this involves the inclusion of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>environmental considerations in the business strategy. During the 1990s many com-
</p>
<p>panies experienced an enormous pressure from critical stakeholders, governments, 
</p>
<p>media, NGOs, and international organisations to demonstrate that they had adopted 
</p>
<p>sustainable business practices.
</p>
<p>The days when Aristotle Onassis could tuck his whalers out of sight behind convenient 
icebergs are almost gone. New technologies and open borders render most forms of eco-
nomic, environmental, and social abuse increasingly visible. Indeed, far from being 
drowned in a floodtide of useless information, many of the world&rsquo;s citizens&nbsp;&ndash; thanks in large 
part to the public interest groups a number of them support&nbsp;&ndash; are becoming increasingly 
adept at keeping track of the activities of corporations and governments.2
</p>
<p>The concept of &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; is often traced back to the World Commission on 
</p>
<p>Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission) report which coined 
</p>
<p>the following definition: &ldquo;Sustainable Development is development that meets the 
</p>
<p>needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet 
</p>
<p>their own needs&rdquo;.3 As the number of organisations that claim to adhere to sustain-
</p>
<p>able business practices increases, so does the number of pieces of information that 
</p>
<p>is prepared and disseminated about these practices. In a recent publication, the 
</p>
<p>ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and CorporateRegistar.
</p>
<p>com reported that in 1993 there were fewer than 100 cases of corporate non- financial

</p>
<p>reporting worldwide, but by 2003 there were over 1500 reports produced worldwide 
</p>
<p>on an annual basis.4 As these practices have become more common amongst corpo-
</p>
<p>rations, there has been criticism as to whether these same firms are purely &lsquo;window 
</p>
<p>dressing&rsquo;, with no ambitions to embed sustainability in their business practices. A 
</p>
<p>survey on corporate social responsibility in The Economist stated:
</p>
<p>Under pressure, big multinationals ask their critics to judge them by CSR criteria, and then, 
as the critics charge, mostly fail to follow through. Their efforts may be enough to convince 
the public that what they see is pretty, and in many cases this may be all they ever intended 
to achieve. But by and large CSR is at best a gloss on capitalism, not the deep systematic 
reform that its champions deem desirable.5
</p>
<p>This case raises the question of how managers can adopt appropriate manage-
</p>
<p>ment control systems to communicate to employees and other stakeholders what 
</p>
<p>behaviour is desired, and to ensure that their corporate sustainability claims are 
</p>
<p>implemented at the operational level. That is, how can organisations demonstrate 
</p>
<p>that their sustainability declarations are not just &ldquo;good looks&rdquo;. Specifically, this case 
</p>
<p>unfolds Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s long-term commitment to sustainable business practices 
</p>
<p>and the company&rsquo;s validations of these practices by focusing on how issues of sus-
</p>
<p>tainability have been integrated and cascaded throughout the entire organisation via 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s &lsquo;Way of Management&rsquo;. The Novo Nordisk business unit&nbsp;&ndash; Diabetes 
</p>
<p>Finished Products&nbsp;&ndash; is used an example.
</p>
<p> Introduction to&nbsp;Novo Nordisk A/S
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk A/S was founded by August Krogh in the 1922, a Danish Nobel lau-
</p>
<p>reate in physiology. He was inspired by two Canadian researchers, Frederick 
</p>
<p>Banting and Charles Best, who had begun extracting insulin from the pancreas of 
</p>
<p>cows in the previous year. August Krogh&rsquo;s wife, Marie, had type 2 diabetes; there-
</p>
<p>fore, he established Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium to produce insulin for the treat-
</p>
<p>ment of diabetes. In 1925 two former employees, Harald and Thorvald Pedersen, 
</p>
<p>established a competing insulin company, Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. In 1989, 
</p>
<p>the two companies merged and became Novo Nordisk A/S.
</p>
<p>By 2005, Novo Nordisk was a world leader in diabetes care; the company also 
</p>
<p>held a leading position in hemostasis management, growth hormone therapy and 
</p>
<p>hormone replacement therapy. Novo Nordisk previously was involved in the pro-
</p>
<p>duction of enzymes. However, a demerger in 2000 saw the establishment of 
</p>
<p>Novozymes, which took over the enzymes production, leaving Novo Nordisk to 
</p>
<p>focus entirely on healthcare. Novo Nordisk headquarters is located in Denmark, on

<p>the outskirts of Copenhagen, and employed in 2005 approximately 20,000 employ-
</p>
<p>ees in 78 countries. Novo Nordisk marketed its products in 179 countries.
</p>
<p>Appendix 1 provides Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s organisational structure anno 2005. From 
</p>
<p>2002 Corporate Stakeholder Relations became part of the executive management 
</p>
<p>team along with R&amp;D, Quality, Regulatory &amp; Business Development, Finance and 
</p>
<p>Operations.
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk is a company based on research. Research and development 
</p>
<p>expenditures equalled 43.2% of the total wage costs in 2004 and have been in the 
</p>
<p>range of 15.0&ndash;16.6% of total turnover over the period 2000&ndash;2004. During this same 
</p>
<p>period, Novo Nordisk had between 526 and 778 active patent families, with between 
</p>
<p>85 and 145 new patent families per year.6
</p>
<p>Financially, Novo Nordisk has performed well, with strong growth in turnover 
</p>
<p>combined with continued high profitability; the market value of the Novo Nordisk 
</p>
<p>has followed the booming American pharmaceutical sector and it outperformed the 
</p>
<p>European pharmaceutical index. In 2004, Novo Nordisk reported an operating profit 
</p>
<p>of 6980 million Danish kroner (DKK), turnover of DKK 29,031 million and a 
</p>
<p>diluted earnings per share of DKK 14.83. Additionally, Novo Nordisk reported a 
</p>
<p>return on invested capital of 21% in 2004. Over the period May 1, 2004 to April 30, 
</p>
<p>2005 Novo Nordisk had a negative share return of 1.55%; however, over the last 
</p>
<p>5&nbsp; years (May 1, 2000 to April 30, 2005) Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s share return equalled 
</p>
<p>44.17%.7 Appendix 2 provides key financial data for the last 5&nbsp;years, and return data 
</p>
<p>for Novo Nordisk, the Danish market, and other large European pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies over the same period.
</p>
<p>The share ownership of Novo Nordisk is developed to ensure that the organisation 
</p>
<p>has a high degree of freedom, as it is not open for takeovers, for example, from larger 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies. Specifically, total share capital is divided into A-shares 
</p>
<p>and B-shares (each B-share carries 1/10 of the votes of an A-share). The A-shares are 
</p>
<p>non-listed and held by Novo A/S (which is a private limited Danish company that is 
</p>
<p>100% owned by the Novo Nordisk Foundation which was established with the 
</p>
<p>merger in 1989). The B-shares are publicly traded on the Copenhagen, London and 
</p>
<p>New&nbsp;York stock exchanges. As reported in the 2004 Annual Report, Novo A/S con-
</p>
<p>trols 26.1% of the B-shares, giving it 70.6% of the total number of votes. Large 
</p>
<p>block-holdings of the remaining B-shares included in 2005 large institutional inves-
</p>
<p>tors like the Danish ATP Pension Fund (4.3%), The Capital Group Companies (10%), 
</p>
<p>and Fidelity Investments (4.4%). Additionally, the company itself held 6.4% of the 
</p>
<p>shares. &lsquo;Other&rsquo; investors held the remaining 48.8%, which included employees.8 
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s board of directors consisted of ten members: seven elected by the 
</p>
<p>shareholders and three by the employees.9 Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s six executive directors as

directors in Danish companies, see for example: Rose, C., &ldquo;Medarbejderrepr&aelig;sentation i danske 
bestyrelser&rdquo;. Center for Kreditret- og Kapitalmarkedsret, Copenhagen Business School Press,

</p>
<p>well as the directors of the Novo Nordisk Foundation were not represented in the 
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk board, which was in accordance with the general guidelines of corpo-
</p>
<p>rate governance at the Copenhagen, London and New&nbsp;York stock exchanges. It was 
</p>
<p>increasingly important issue to demonstrate that Novo Nordisk was doing business 
</p>
<p>according to these guidelines. However, in 2000, the former CEO, Mads &Oslash;vlisen, 
</p>
<p>assumed the role as chairman of the Board of Novo Nordisk..
</p>
<p> Sustainability as&nbsp;Part of&nbsp;Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s Business Strategy
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk has worked strategically with environmental and social responsibility 
</p>
<p>since the beginning of 1990es, and in 2005 sustainability was an integrated part of 
</p>
<p>the business strategy. Engagement in stakeholder dialogue and corporate social 
</p>
<p>responsibility was extremely important to Novo Nordisk, and CEO of the company, 
</p>
<p>Lars Rebien S&oslash;rensen, believed trust to be imperative:
</p>
<p>Public authorities and NGOs have sharpened their tone, and we must take them seriously&rdquo;, 
stated President and CEO of Novo Nordisk, Lars Rebien S&oslash;rensen. &ldquo;It is important to be 
open and honest about our stand and our actions. Trust has to be earned10
</p>
<p>Executive management at Novo Nordisk had made corporate values and sustain-
</p>
<p>ability an integrated part of the company&rsquo;s corporate brand. Mads &Oslash;vlisen, Novo 
</p>
<p>Nordisk&rsquo;s chairman until 2006, often expressed strong views in the business press, 
</p>
<p>and on a number of occasions on the front pages, on issues of sustainability. Many 
</p>
<p>Danish business managers considered him the embodiment of corporate sustain-
</p>
<p>ability.11 He has participated in a number of government and business initiatives in 
</p>
<p>this area, as well as contributing to the foundation of the European Academy of 
</p>
<p>Business in Society and he is Senior Advisor to the Un Global Compact. He is also 
</p>
<p>an adjunct professor of corporate social responsibility at Copenhagen Business 
</p>
<p>School.
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s annual financial report of 2003 demarcated top management&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>dedication to sustainability, as it carries the same title as the sustainability report 
</p>
<p>2003: &ldquo;What does being there mean to you?&rdquo; In the welcome letter the CEO, Lars 
</p>
<p>Rebien S&oslash;rensen and the chairman, Mads &Oslash;vlisen, explained why stakeholders 
</p>
<p>matter to core business:
</p>
<p>Whom do corporations serve? Not so many years ago, we would have said &lsquo;shareholders&rsquo;, 
without hesitation. But increasingly business enterprises are recognising commitments to 
serve other stakeholders&nbsp;&ndash; such as customers, employees, societies at large&nbsp;&ndash; in addition to 
</p>
<p>10 Novo Nordisk A/S, Annual Report 2004, p.&nbsp;18.
11 For example: &ldquo;This is Mads &Oslash;vlisen, the former CEO of Novo Nordisk and one of the most 
admired individuals in Danish business. As he retired in 2000 after 19&nbsp;years as chief executive offi-
cer in Novo Nordisk, he had increased the number of employees from 4.000 to 15.000. He has won 
prizes for his management style of trustworthiness, and he has made Novo Nordisk synonymous 
with corporate social responsibility. But he has remained the approachable Mads with tucked-up 
sleeves. &Oslash;vlisen is a success, a living legend, a walking lump of gold&rdquo;, Euroman, March 2005, p.&nbsp;46.

</p>
<p>shareholders. In order to serve the long term interest of stakeholders, companies must 
regards it as core part of their business to assume a wider responsibility and consider 
broadly the wide range of factors which may impact its ability to generate returns over long 
periods of time12
</p>
<p>The conspicuous commitment to sustainability was reinforced in the 2004 annual 
</p>
<p>report, which was the company&rsquo;s first integrated triple bottom line report combining 
</p>
<p>economic, environmental and social results. In the opening, the commitment was 
</p>
<p>stated clearly collectively by Lars Rebien S&oslash;rensen and Mads &Oslash;vlisen on page 1 of 
</p>
<p>the 2004 Annual Report:
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk takes a multi-pronged approach to providing better access to health through 
capacity building, a preferential pricing policy for the poorest nations and funding through 
the World Diabetes Foundation, which is now reaching out to many millions of people with 
diabetes. In terms of sustainability, Novo Nordisk demonstrates its determination to play a 
leading role by setting a target for an absolute reduction of CO2 emissions over the next 
decade. When people can overcome the challenges of diabetes, we must as a company 
tackle the global challenges of social and sustainable stewardship.
</p>
<p>In 2002, the inclusion of Stakeholder Relations as part of the executive manage-
</p>
<p>ment team demarcated a strengthening of Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s sustainability focus. In 
</p>
<p>2004, the Stakeholder Relations area was expanded and Lise Kingo (Executive Vice 
</p>
<p>President) became responsible for corporate communications, human resources and 
</p>
<p>occupational health service in what was in 2005 referred to as &ldquo;People, reputation 
</p>
<p>and relations&rdquo; with approximately 200 employees working in this group. Ms. Kingo 
</p>
<p>believed that her group was responsible for the two most important assets in Novo 
</p>
<p>Nordisk: the people and the brand. This department was responsible for driving, 
</p>
<p>challenging and monitoring Triple Bottom Line strategies and helping the business 
</p>
<p>units to implement new activities in relation to sustainability by13:
</p>
<p>&bull; Monitoring issues and spotting trends that may affect future business
</p>
<p>&bull; Engaging with stakeholders to reconcile dilemmas and find common ground for 
</p>
<p>more sustainable solutions
</p>
<p>&bull; Building relationships with key stakeholders in the global, international and 
</p>
<p>local communities of which Novo Nordisk is a part
</p>
<p>&bull; Driving and embedding long-term thinking and the Triple Bottom Line mindset 
</p>
<p>throughout the company
</p>
<p>&bull; Accounting for the company&rsquo;s performance and conveying Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>positions, objectives and goals to audiences with an interest in the company

</p>
<p> History of&nbsp;Sustainability
</p>
<p>The focus on sustainability was not new for Novo Nordisk. In the late 1960s Novo 
</p>
<p>Nordisk was confronted with severe stakeholder criticisms for the first time, and a 
</p>
<p>close interaction with a broad variety of stakeholders have been part of the compa-
</p>
<p>ny&rsquo;s strategy since then. Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s first encounter with stakeholder criticism 
</p>
<p>was surrounding new production methods that introduced genetically engineered 
</p>
<p>micro-organisms, resulting in the development of a new product line of enzymes. 
</p>
<p>These enzymes were important ingredients in many products (e.g., detergent). 
</p>
<p>Environmentally oriented NGOs, as well as scientific articles, first raised awareness 
</p>
<p>that the use of detergents with enzymes could lead to those in contact with the prod-
</p>
<p>uct developing allergies, and that the dust from the production process could have 
</p>
<p>implications for employees&rsquo; health. Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s sales fell dramatically, and the 
</p>
<p>company reacted with a strong and fast response by developing dust-free enzymes 
</p>
<p>presenting no risk for the consumers.14 Sales rose again and enzyme production 
</p>
<p>became an important part of Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s production in Denmark, USA and 
</p>
<p>Japan.
</p>
<p>In 2001, Novo Nordisk was once again confronted with criticism from NGOs. 
</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry association in South Africa,, including Novo 
</p>
<p>Nordisk, raised the issue of protecting intellectual property rights with the South 
</p>
<p>African government. This led to major public criticism of the consortium mem-
</p>
<p>bers, who were accused of giving priority to profits at the expense of the health of 
</p>
<p>less advantaged people. Again, Novo Nordisk reacted fast. By engaging in dia-
</p>
<p>logue with the NGOs, the company defined a new policy to strengthen the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s presence and development of medicines to combat diabetes in developing 
</p>
<p>countries. A new pricing policy and the establishment of the World Diabetes 
</p>
<p>Foundation in late 2001 can be seen as a strategic result of Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>response to the criticism.
</p>
<p>Issues of importance for sustainability in Novo Nordisk had changed from a 
</p>
<p>predominantly environmental focus to a focus that includes health, safety and bio-
</p>
<p>ethics issues, and a focus on how to integrate issues of social responsibility. To 
</p>
<p>illustrate the concurrent broadening of the scope Novo Nordisk had developed a 
</p>
<p>learning curve, shown below in Fig.&nbsp;30.1.15
</p>
<p>The learning curve shows that Novo Nordisk perceived sustainability as a con-
</p>
<p>tinuous learning process, in which the company needed to be able to take in new 
</p>
<p>issues and integrate these concurrently in the business strategy towards &ldquo;full busi-
</p>
<p>ness integration&rdquo;.

</p>
<p> How Did Novo Nordisk Meet Its Objectives of&nbsp;Being 
Sustainable?
</p>
<p>In 1997, the Novo Nordisk Way of Management (see Fig.&nbsp;30.2, below) was intro-
</p>
<p>duced as an overall guideline to ensure that Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s strategic goals were 
</p>
<p>reached at the operational level. A central part of the strategic goal was the integra-
</p>
<p>tion and implementation of sustainable business practices:
</p>
<p>The Novo Nordisk Way of Management serves as the solid footing from which innovative 
ideas can take off. Its immediate strengths lie in its consistency, coherence and systematic 
follow-up methods. It is the way we do things.16
</p>
<p>The Novo Nordisk Way of Management was designed and introduced to 
</p>
<p>strike a balance between corporate control and decentralized decision-making. 
</p>
<p>It was implemented as a reaction to the situation in the previous year where 
</p>
<p>company systems, procedures and routines were standardized and centralized at 
</p>
<p>headquarters in Bagsv&aelig;rd in Denmark, and this had led to dissatisfaction among 
</p>
<p>managers in the foreign subsidiaries who found that the systems did not always 
</p>
<p>fit with the local situation and needs. As an illustration of this balance, Henrik 
</p>
<p>G&uuml;rtler, CEO of Novo A/S, saw the Novo Nordisk Way of Management as an 
</p>

<p>645
</p>
<p>opportunity to develop new and motivating control systems throughout the 
</p>
<p>entire organisation:
</p>
<p>New initiatives and management programmes were introduced regularly, but they had no effect 
across borders. They were encapsulated and never seemed to make much difference outside 
corporate headquarters. It annoyed me, and when the Novo Nordisk Way of Management was 
designed as a new and overall guideline, I decided to do something about it.17
</p>
<p>17 Quote from CEO Henrik G&uuml;rtler, Novo A/S, June 2, 2005

<p>646
</p>
<p>Then CEO, Mads &Oslash;vlisen explained the Novo Nordisk Way of Management for 
</p>
<p>all managers and employees in a letter in January 1997:
</p>
<p>The Novo Nordisk Way of Management is a comprehensive and easy-to-use guide which 
should allow you to use your insight and judgment in complying also with the &ldquo;local&rdquo; man-
agement and quality system derived from this corporate basis for use in functions an depart-
ments throughout Novo Nordisk.&rdquo;18
</p>
<p>The Novo Nordisk Way of Management extended beyond products and manu-
</p>
<p>facturing operations to include all activities, and as such it was a broad frame that 
</p>
<p>described the rationale that should set the tone and the standards amongst managers 
</p>
<p>and employees in the entire organization. Additionally, Novo Nordisk also devel-
</p>
<p>oped a vision, values, commitments, and fundamentals in order to inspire and guide 
</p>
<p>its employees to achieve superior performance. These are included in Appendix 3.
</p>
<p>To ensure that the entire organisation understood and adhered to the Novo 
</p>
<p>Nordisk Way of Management, the company has developed a methodology consisting 
</p>
<p>of three elements: facilitators, sustainability reporting and balanced scorecard. Each 
</p>
<p>of these elements is discussed below.
</p>
<p> Facilitators
</p>
<p>The Facilitators were a team of around 16 high-profile professionals at the holding 
</p>
<p>company, Novo A/S.&nbsp;Each of them had a professional background from senior 
</p>
<p>specialist or managerial positions in Novo Nordisk or Novozymes. They travelled in 
</p>
<p>pairs to visit all business units and levels of the entire organisation every third year. 
</p>
<p>The first team of facilitators was recruited internally in 1996; the Facilitator team 
</p>
<p>had a blend of ages, gender, professions and nationalities. They served to assess, 
</p>
<p>assist and facilitate units and projects to perform better. Their tasks were19:
</p>
<p> 1. Through on-site auditing/faciliting of departments, factories, affiliates, assess 
</p>
<p>whether or not the company-wide minimum standard requirements or &ldquo;ground 
</p>
<p>rules&rdquo; as specified in the Novo Nordisk Way of Management are met.
</p>
<p> 2. Through on-site advice and help, assist the unit in question in correcting identified 
</p>
<p>non-compliance with these requirements.
</p>
<p> 3. Through on-site identification of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; applied, facilitate communica-
</p>
<p>tion and sharing of these across the organization.
</p>
<p>A facilitation was a structured, planned assessment of the status the Novo Nordisk 
</p>
<p>Way of Management within the unit or project with the aim of developing agreed 
</p>
<p>actions for improvement. In conducting the facilitation, the facilitators would20:

</p>
<p>&bull; Obtain objective evidence through a fact-finding process
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide objective, validated assessments and conclusion
</p>
<p>&bull; Include recommendations for improvements where appropriate
</p>
<p>&bull; Agree on action plans with unit or process managers
</p>
<p>&bull; Follow up on the implementation of the action plan
</p>
<p>&bull; Fulfil their responsibilities in a manner demonstrating integrity, objectivity, and 
</p>
<p>professional behaviour
</p>
<p>The facilitation process consisted of three stages. First is the pre-facilitation, in 
</p>
<p>which the scope of the facilitation was identified and material to support the process 
</p>
<p>was developed. Second was the facilitation itself, in which facilitators meet with the 
</p>
<p>individual unit or project members, and an agreement was made on how to improve. 
</p>
<p>Finally, a post-facilitation process was conducted, in which the facilitator was 
</p>
<p>responsible for following up and reporting to executive management on the achieve-
</p>
<p>ments with respect to the action points agreed upon in stage two. Appendix 4 pro-
</p>
<p>vides excerpts from a facilitation at the Diabetes Pharmaceutical Site Hiller&oslash;d.
</p>
<p> Sustainability Reporting
</p>
<p>Sustainability reporting was used to ensure that sustainability thinking became part of 
</p>
<p>everyday business practices at Novo Nordisk. In 1989 Novo Nordisk produced its first 
</p>
<p>environmental management review as part of its proactive stakeholder strategy&nbsp;&ndash; long 
</p>
<p>before environmental reporting became compulsory for companies like Novo Nordisk. 
</p>
<p>In 1994 Novo Nordisk produced its first environmental report including resource con-
</p>
<p>sumption, emissions and use of experimental animals. Later, in 1998, a social report 
</p>
<p>was issued, and since 1999 Novo Nordisk has published annual reports on sustain-
</p>
<p>ability integrating environmental, social and economic concerns.21 For the first time in 
</p>
<p>2004, Novo Nordisk integrated this information with its financial results and reported 
</p>
<p>a combined social, environmental and economic report&nbsp;&ndash; The Annual Report 2004. 
</p>
<p>These reports addressed issues recommended by United Nation&rsquo;s Global Compact, 
</p>
<p>the Global Reporting Initiative&rsquo;s 2002 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, and fol-
</p>
<p>lowed the approach laid out in the AA1000 Framework; the reports delivered a com-
</p>
<p>prehensive documentation of Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s ambitions, goals, initiatives, results and 
</p>
<p>new targets for environmental and social responsibility.
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk was renowned nationally and internationally for its dedication to 
</p>
<p>corporate sustainability and for pioneering new agendas and concurrent develop-
</p>
<p>ment of stakeholder relations. Recent recognition included being ranked by 
</p>
<p>Corporate Knights Inc. in February 2005 amongst the top 100 sustainable compa-
</p>
<p>nies in the world, and being ranked second in the world by SustainAbility and the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Environment Programme in November 2004 for its ability to iden-
</p>
<p>tify and manage social and environmental issues as accounted for in its sustainabil-
</p>

<p>sixth time!) of the European Sustainability Awards (sponsored by the Association of 
</p>
<p>Chartered Certified Accountants), and in Denmark, Novo Nordisk had won six 
</p>
<p>prizes for the best annual social report awarded by the Association of Danish 
</p>
<p>Accountants and the Danish business newspaper B&oslash;rsen.22 In the annual image anal-
</p>
<p>ysis reported in B&oslash;rsen, Novo Nordisk had in 1992, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005 
</p>
<p>ranked either one or two, with a high score on the corporate social responsibility 
</p>
<p>element. In 2004 Novo Nordisk was second to A.P.&nbsp;M&oslash;ller.23
</p>
<p>In order to measure its progress towards sustainability, Novo Nordisk used a 
</p>
<p>Triple Bottom Line approach which linked a set of key targets to sustainability 
</p>
<p>goals. Appendix 5 provided details from Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s Annual Report 2004 on 
</p>
<p>the specific indicators used, and the reason for using them (impact). As shown in 
</p>
<p>this appendix there were six strategic areas for Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s Triple Bottom Line 
</p>
<p>performance:
</p>
<p> 1. Living our values
</p>
<p> 2. Access to health
</p>
<p> 3. Our employees
</p>
<p> 4. Our use of animals
</p>
<p> 5. Eco-efficiency and compliance
</p>
<p> 6. Economic contribution
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Living our values&rsquo; aimed to measure whether business actions are consistent 
</p>
<p>with corporate values. Three performance metrics were used to gauge how well the 
</p>
<p>company performs in this area; two of which were taken from an annual employee 
</p>
<p>survey (eVoice) and one was directly related to the use of facilitators (discussed 
</p>
<p>above).
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Access to health&rsquo; was included as a means to ensure that the company as a phar-
</p>
<p>maceutical company was involved in promoting improvements in global health 
</p>
<p>standards. Two measures were used to gauge Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s presence in less devel-
</p>
<p>oped countries.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our employees&rsquo; was included to ensure Novo Nordisk maintains high standards 
</p>
<p>in relation to its workforce. Four performance measures were used to gauge Novo 
</p>
<p>Nordisk&rsquo;s treatment of their employees; two of these measures were taken from the 
</p>
<p>eVocie employee survey.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our use of animals&rsquo; was included to ensure Novo Nordisk, as a pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>company was in good standing with a key stakeholder group&nbsp; &ndash; animal welfare 
</p>
<p>groups (in particular, the Danish Animal Welfare Society). Two metrics were used 
</p>
<p>to ensure the ethical treatment of all animals used in research.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eco-efficiency and compliance&rsquo; was included to measure Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>impact on the environment. Four performance measures were included to measure

</p>
<p>the organisation&rsquo;s use of water and energy, their compliance with regulations and 
</p>
<p>the implementation of ISO 140001.24
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Economic contribution&rsquo; was more than the traditional area of financial perfor-
</p>
<p>mance&nbsp;&ndash; it also covered the company&rsquo;s socio-economic impacts. Five metrics were 
</p>
<p>used, including traditional measures such as operating profit margin and return on 
</p>
<p>invested capital, but also one metric that measured how much the company contrib-
</p>
<p>utes to the national economic capacity (total taxes as a percentage of turnover).
</p>
<p>The Triple Bottom Line was used as a firm wide tool to ensure Novo Nordisk 
</p>
<p>took actions that were consistent with operating as a sustainable company. All met-
</p>
<p>rics used in the Triple Bottom Line reported aggregate performance across all busi-
</p>
<p>ness units to present the full picture. Novo Nordisk did not report Triple Bottom 
</p>
<p>Line performance at a disaggregated level (i.e., for each business unit), but did pro-
</p>
<p>vide specific and detailed data for eight major production sites.
</p>
<p>Transparent reporting is a vital instrument for us in accounting for our performance on the 
</p>
<p>Triple Bottom Line. This is where we can account for our approach to doing business in a 
</p>
<p>single document and cohesively present performance, progress, positions and strategic ini-
</p>
<p>tiatives as well as the dilemmas and key issues we face as a pharmaceutical company. Most 
</p>
<p>importantly, what we present in the report is the result of our interactions and engagements 
</p>
<p>with stakeholders, said Susanne Stormer,25 then manager in Corporate Stakeholder 
Relations and responsible for Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s sustainability reporting.
</p>
<p> Balanced Scorecard
</p>
<p>Rather than assessing each division with a Triple Bottom Line performance report, 
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk relied on the balanced scorecard:
</p>
<p>The Balanced Scorecard is the management tool for embedding and cascading the Triple 
Bottom Line approach throughout the organisation. The Scorecard is a vital element of the 
corporate governance set-up in Novo Nordisk and thus a very powerful tool to ensure inte-
gration of the sustainability approach into all business processes.26
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk had been using balanced scorecards since 1996; it was introduced 
</p>
<p>primarily as a financial management tool. The administration of the scorecards 
</p>
<p>rested with the Finance, Legal and IT department, which had a mandate to use the 
</p>
<p>best management methods, of which balanced scorecards are viewed as an effective 
</p>
<p>tool. The involvement of finance personnel with respect to balanced scorecards was 
</p>
<p>to facilitate workshops (that is supporting management teams), assist in setting of 
</p>
<p>targets, reviewing balanced scorecards, and changes to/improvements in financial 
</p>
<p>management (i.e., integrating the balanced scorecard with processes).
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk cascaded its balanced scorecard down to the business unit level, 
</p>
<p>from which it translated into individual employees&rsquo; personal targets, which were set 
</p>
<p>24 ISO 14001 is an environmental management standard with auditing tools and procedures.

</p>
<p>and reviewed on a biannual basis. Specifically, a balanced scorecard was prepared 
</p>
<p>for the organisation as a whole; this scorecard was then cascaded down to the execu-
</p>
<p>tive VP level (there were five executive VPs, each with their own scorecard). From 
</p>
<p>this level, each of the 20 Senior VPs also had a balanced scorecard (i.e., the business 
</p>
<p>unit level). From this level there was no formal mandate that the scorecards were 
</p>
<p>further cascaded; however, in some business units, scorecards could be prepared for 
</p>
<p>each individual sub-unit (e.g., a particular factory). In general, the sub-unit typically 
</p>
<p>was evaluated on a collection of KPIs, rather than having objectives in each of the 
</p>
<p>four traditional sections of a balanced scorecard.
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk currently had a total of 24 objectives in its balanced scorecard 
</p>
<p>under the following four headings: (1) Customers &amp; Society, (2) Finance, (3) 
</p>
<p>Business Processes, and (4) People &amp; Organisation. To facilitate the operation of the 
</p>
<p>balanced scorecard, each objective was &lsquo;owned&rsquo; by one of the five executive areas 
</p>
<p>at Novo Nordisk. Corporate Stakeholder Relations was responsible for seven of the 
</p>
<p>24 objectives. These were:
</p>
<p> 1. Increase internationalisation
</p>
<p> 2. Support diversity
</p>
<p> 3. Ensure talent development
</p>
<p> 4. Ensure performance management
</p>
<p> 5. Ensure superior company reputation
</p>
<p> 6. Ensure environmental, social, and ethical performance
</p>
<p> 7. Improve our collaboration with key stakeholders in diabetes care worldwide
</p>
<p> The Use of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Balanced Scorecard at Diabetes Finished Products
</p>
<p>One of the key business units at Novo Nordisk was Diabetes Finished Products 
</p>
<p>(DFP). This group was responsible for the production and distribution of all prod-
</p>
<p>ucts related to the treatment of Diabetes. In 2004, the group produced 807 million 
</p>
<p>units of its four key products (Penfill&reg; 3&nbsp;ml filling, Prefilled 3&nbsp;ml total, Penfill&reg; 
</p>
<p>3&nbsp;ml blister, and Insulin vials).27 There were approximately 3100 employees, spread 
</p>
<p>across eight sites and DFP headquarters. Appendix 6 provides the organisational 
</p>
<p>chart for DFP.&nbsp;Specifically, there were five production sites (three in Denmark, one 
</p>
<p>in the United States, one in France); moreover, Novo Nordisk was expanding with 
</p>
<p>another production facility in Brazil. Additionally, there was a logistics unit, and a 
</p>
<p>manufacturing development unit that worked to take new products to mass produc-
</p>
<p>tion. Eric Drap&eacute; was the Senior Vice President of Diabetes Finished Products. Eric 
</p>
<p>was a pharmacist by training, and had been with Novo Nordisk since 1990. He had 
</p>
<p>been in his role since January 2004; his previous position was as a site manager 
</p>
<p>(VP) at the French production facility.

<p>Figure 30.3 illustrates how the Balanced Scorecard was cascaded from Corporate 
</p>
<p>to DFP.&nbsp;In our illustrations (Appendices 6, 7 and 8), we chose to not include the 
</p>
<p>corporate level.
</p>
<p>To illustrate how specific critical success factors (CSF) were cascaded through 
</p>
<p>the organisation, Appendices 7, 8 and 9 describe the KPIs, the KPI definition and 
</p>
<p>the 2005 target for three CSFs for Operations, Product Supply and Diabetes Finished 
</p>
<p>Products. The three CSFs illustrated were those that were most closely aligned with 
</p>
<p>the social and environmental issues in Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s Triple Bottom Line.
</p>
<p>The first CSF (Appendix 7) is to ensure environmental, social and ethical perfor-
</p>
<p>mance. With respect to DFP only one KPI was included, EPI performance, which 
</p>
<p>was intended to measure the relation between total yield of product and consump-
</p>
<p>tion of water and energy. Further up the organisation, the emission of carbon diox-
</p>
<p>ide (CO2) was also measured. Noticeably missing from the corporate balanced 
</p>
<p>scorecards28 were any KPIs which measured social and ethical performance&nbsp;&ndash; most 
</p>
<p>likely a reflection of the general difficulty of defining meaningful and quantifiable 
</p>
<p>social indicators at a corporate level.
</p>
<p>The second CSF (Appendix 8) was a focus on supporting diversity and social 
</p>
<p>responsibility. Throughout the organisation three KPIs were used. The first was 
</p>
<p>intended to ensure that each level of the organisation supported diversity and ensured 
</p>
<p>equal opportunities to its employees. The second was the number of employees that 
</p>
<p>had evaluated progress according to the OA.&nbsp;Finally, was a metric which focused on 
</p>
<p>the functioning and value of the Job Transfer Centre, which was a centre that had 
</p>
<p>been established in connection with the company&rsquo;s global sourcing strategy, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to which new jobs were created abroad, not in Denmark. The Job Transfer

</p>
<p>Centre assisted Novo Nordisk employees in those units that were facing staffing 
</p>
<p>changes to find a new job within, or outside Novo Nordisk.
</p>
<p>The third CSF (Appendix 9) was to ensure talent development. Similar to the 
</p>
<p>previous CSF, the use and number of KPIs was consistently applied throughout the 
</p>
<p>organisation. Specifically, two KPIs were used. The first was the utilisation of talent 
</p>
<p>pools with respect to the filling of new or vacant VP positions. The second KPI was 
</p>
<p>the results of the section of questions on an annual employee survey (eVoice) which 
</p>
<p>aimed to gauge perceptions of employee development.29
</p>
<p>As a SVP, Eric was responsible for the balanced scorecard for his business unit, 
</p>
<p>and he believed that it was an effective management tool:
</p>
<p>The primary benefit [of the balanced scorecard] is to secure that people are aligned to the 
strategic goals of the company, and that they are not working for something which is not 
necessary to work for. We have full alignment, and that&rsquo;s very convenient and 
comfortable.30
</p>
<p>Eric was responsible for the 2005 DFP balanced scorecard, which had 27 KPIs: 
</p>
<p>three in Finance, 12&nbsp;in Business Processes, eight in People &amp; Organisations, and 
</p>
<p>four in Customers &amp; Society, (Appendix 9 illustrates the CSFs, CSF rationale and 
</p>
<p>KPIs for DFP&rsquo;s 2005 balanced scorecard). There was no formal cascading of this 
</p>
<p>balanced scorecard to the seven VPs. Nevertheless, each site was responsible for, 
</p>
<p>and evaluated on, the majority of KPIs that were in the DFP balanced scorecard 
</p>
<p>(each site is evaluated on approximately 20 KPIs).
</p>
<p>The formal monitoring of the sites was done on a monthly basis. Specifically, 
</p>
<p>data on all KPIs was calculated and updated into Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s IT system (PEIS), 
</p>
<p>and each site manager had to prepare a monthly report which explained any devia-
</p>
<p>tions from targets. Additionally, any deviation that was significantly large (gaining 
</p>
<p>a red designation in the system) must be answered with a specific action plan. Eric 
</p>
<p>also had informal discussions with his VPs every one to 2&nbsp;months. The purpose of 
</p>
<p>these meetings was to gauge how performance is proceeding. In addition to the 
</p>
<p>monthly monitoring and informal discussions, Eric met each of his site managers 
</p>
<p>twice a year as part of a formal Business Review. The purpose of these meetings was 
</p>
<p>to discuss the monthly action plans, but also to discuss the overall site&rsquo;s balanced 
</p>
<p>scorecard.
</p>
<p>In addition to being evaluated on the balanced scorecard, Eric&rsquo;s (and his VPs) 
</p>
<p>bonus compensation was also tied to balance scorecard performance. Appendix 10 
</p>
<p>provides Eric&rsquo;s Performance Index for 2005. As shown, Eric was compensated 
</p>
<p>29 eVoice was an annual survey which asks a minimum of 48 questions around eight mandatory 
themes (Vision and Values, Development of employees, Employee engagement, Equal Opportunity, 
Stress and workload, Quality mindset, Performance orientation, and Internationalisation). In addi-
tion, each unit and project group could include up to an additional 72 questions from 12 themes 
(Customer orientations, Winning culture, Working climate, Empowerment, Cooperation across 
functions, Communication, Innovation, Planning and execution, Working conditions, Novo 
Nordisk policies, Best Practice, and Reporting).

<p>653
</p>
<p>based on 13 KPIs (two in Finance, three in Customers, six in Processes and two in 
</p>
<p>People &amp; Organisation). The weighting scheme worked as follows: if Eric achieves 
</p>
<p>each target, he received a score for that KPI of 100. If he exceeded the target, then 
</p>
<p>the score for the particular KPI was greater than 100; if he did not achieve the target, 
</p>
<p>then the score for the particular KPI was less than 100. Each KPI score was multi-
</p>
<p>plied by its respective percentage weight (e.g., 15% for Investments). The achieved 
</p>
<p>index score was equal to the sum of the weighted scores across all of the KPIs. For 
</p>
<p>Eric, the amount of bonus he received was 50% dependent on his achieved index 
</p>
<p>score and 50% dependent on the achieved index score of Product Supply. For each 
</p>
<p>VP in DFP, their bonus calculation was similar, except each VP only had ten KPIs 
</p>
<p>influencing their bonus calculation. Of these ten, some were mandatory (across all 
</p>
<p>sites) and some were voluntary (agreed between Eric and each VP). The voluntary 
</p>
<p>KPIs tended to be related more to social objectives, as they were geared towards 
</p>
<p>addressing issues which reflected the local environment. The payment of the bonus 
</p>
<p>to each VP was 50% dependent on their achieved index score, and 50% dependent 
</p>
<p>on the achieved index for DFP.&nbsp;Finally, Novo Nordisk used stretch targets in that in 
</p>
<p>2005 to receive a full bonus Eric (and his VPs) must have had an achieved index 
</p>
<p>score of 105 (if targets were only hit (i.e., not exceeded) then only a 50% bonus was 
</p>
<p>paid) (Appendix 11).
</p>
<p> Conclusion
</p>
<p>As illustrated Novo Nordisk was prime example of one organisation that included 
</p>
<p>sustainability as an integrated part of its strategy, and attempts to consider it in all of 
</p>
<p>its business decisions. To help managers consider sustainability in all of their busi-
</p>
<p>ness decisions, the company had adopted the Novo Nordisk Way of Management as 
</p>
<p>one of their primary operating tools. Included in the Novo Nordisk Way of 
</p>
<p>Management were three pillars that should help to operationalise Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>corporate objectives: the facilitators, the annual (sustainability) reporting and the 
</p>
<p>balanced scorecard. The significant question that remained, however, is to what 
</p>
<p>extent each of these pillars was effective in influencing behaviour at the operational 
</p>
<p>level.
</p>
<p> Epilogue 2015
</p>
<p>Ten years can seem like a lifetime. Especially when working in a dynamic business 
</p>
<p>in a rapidly changing environment. Similarly, the field of research into sustainability 
</p>
<p>in business practices has evolved dramatically since this case was written.
</p>
<p>By the entry into 2015 Novo Nordisk had grown significantly and had become 
</p>
<p>the most valuable company in Scandinavia, and even surpassed the Volkswagen 
</p>
<p>group, measured by market capitalisation. It had enjoyed more than 10&nbsp;years of 
</p>
<p>double-digit sales growth, maintained competitive operating growth rates, expanded 
</p>
<p>its global operations and almost doubled the number of employees. Yet, the 
</p>
<p>30 The Ongoing Dynamics of Integrating Sustainability into Business Practice&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>654
</p>
<p>company retained its culture and values, rooted in the Scandinavian tradition, and 
</p>
<p>many of its senior managers remained in the company, albeit not necessarily in the 
</p>
<p>same positions. They would often grow with the business, thereby reinforcing the 
</p>
<p>values and behaviours that were seen as the right thing to do.
</p>
<p>When the long-standing CEO, Mads &Oslash;vlisen, stepped down and left his desk to 
</p>
<p>Lars Rebien S&oslash;rensen there had been concerned voices expressing doubts whether 
</p>
<p>he could fill the shoes of his predecessor, and whether the strong company values 
</p>
<p>would live on.
</p>
<p>Indeed, Lars Rebien S&oslash;rensen had a rough start, faced with the South African 
</p>
<p>court case, but in that situation, and in many that would follow, he demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>his leadership style was formed through many years of working in the organisation. 
</p>
<p>And so his intuitive reactions in times of crisis would always be consistent with the 
</p>
<p>values that the company had lived by for generations: essentially these were about 
</p>
<p>acting responsibly and striking the right balance, respecting the integrity of business 
</p>
<p>partners and other stakeholders, fairness and good old-fashioned decency.
</p>
<p>By 2006, Mads &Oslash;vlisen had left Novo Nordisk, but had made his mark after 
</p>
<p>34&nbsp;years in the company, of which 19&nbsp;years in the role as CEO.&nbsp;And through their 
</p>
<p>partnership while he was chairman of the Board and with Lars Rebien as his CEO 
</p>
<p>successor, a step was taken that would ensure the longevity of the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to the Triple Bottom Line principle: In connection with an update of 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s Articles of Association (the bylaws) a proposal was presented for 
</p>
<p>adoption at the Annual General Meeting in 2004 to include a sentence in the clause 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;objects&rsquo;: &ldquo;The Company strives to conduct its activities in a financially, environ-
</p>
<p>mentally, and socially responsible way.&rdquo; The proposal was, unsurprisingly&nbsp;&ndash; given 
</p>
<p>the majority vote of the owner, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, and the broad support 
</p>
<p>from both institutional and private shareholders&nbsp;&ndash; adopted. The Triple Bottom Line 
</p>
<p>principle had been institutionalised and was as of then safeguarded, regardless of 
</p>
<p>who would be in the CEO chair.
</p>
<p>The intent was to send a very clear signal to investors and other business partners 
</p>
<p>that this is how the company is managed, and will make decisions accordingly. It 
</p>
<p>also specified to people working in Novo Nordisk the philosophy that would guide 
</p>
<p>their decisions and actions, and emphasised the need to get the balance right, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly when faced with difficult dilemmas.
</p>
<p>That decision paved the way for further integration of sustainability thinking 
</p>
<p>into business practices. First, the company&rsquo;s reporting&nbsp;&ndash; which had hitherto like 
</p>
<p>many other companies consisted in a financial report as the legal document and a 
</p>
<p>supplementary, voluntary sustainability report&nbsp; &ndash; was merged into one document. 
</p>
<p>This was presented to, and approved by the Board, as the logical consequence of the 
</p>
<p>decision to emphasise the Triple Bottom Line in the bylaws. Some were concerned 
</p>
<p>it would be the death to sustainability reporting, and with that the company&rsquo;s leader-
</p>
<p>ship position, while others were convinced that this would be the future of corporate 
</p>
<p>reporting.
</p>
<p>In 2009 Lars Rebien S&oslash;rensen found it was time to revisit the Novo Nordisk 
</p>
<p>Way of Management, which had been used since the mid-1990s as the guide for 
</p>
<p>managers on the company&rsquo;s values-based approach to doing business. In light of the 
</p>
<p>M. Morsing et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>655
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s growth, particularly outside of Denmark, time had come to do a sanity 
</p>
<p>check to assess if a revision was needed. He travelled to meet with employees and 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in all corners of the world and came back with a strong conviction that 
</p>
<p>the values were very much alive and that the Triple Bottom Line was important to 
</p>
<p>employees and stakeholders alike. So he and the management team worked together 
</p>
<p>to update and simplify the document that was quite lengthy, and in 2010 announced 
</p>
<p>a renewed, much shorter Novo Nordisk Way. A short credo-like stosryline of the 
</p>
<p>purpose and mission of the company, supplemented with 10 statements, so-called 
</p>
<p>essentials, on the behaviours that should be expected of people working at Novo 
</p>
<p>Nordisk. And it was emphasised that this was not intended for managers, but for 
</p>
<p>every employee.
</p>
<p>While the wording was changed, most of the contents remained, and so did the 
</p>
<p>management system around it. Including the function of the facilitators to ascertain 
</p>
<p>the extent to which the values are being put into action, the principles of remunera-
</p>
<p>tion, the stakeholder engagement approach, and the responsible business practices 
</p>
<p>across the value chain. Over time, management control and reporting systems 
</p>
<p>became more sophisticated, and much effort was invested in upgrading the quality 
</p>
<p>of social and environmental data so they could stand the test of being represented in 
</p>
<p>the Annual Report side by side with financial data that were subject to the strictest 
</p>
<p>international standards for internal controls. Integration came at a cost, and a clean-
</p>
<p> up of data points was begun to ensure that data were robust and similar in scope. 
</p>
<p>Social and environmental reporting became more streamlined over time, and more 
</p>
<p>aligned with strategic business priorities.
</p>
<p>In parallel with these internal changes the sustainability agenda matured, too. 
</p>
<p>While originally companies would typically be pressured by stakeholder groups to 
</p>
<p>adapt criticised practices that were considered harmful to people, communities or 
</p>
<p>the environment, regulation took over, complemented by soft law and voluntary 
</p>
<p>initiatives, often made by industry sectors rather than individual companies. 
</p>
<p>Responsibility had become common practice and a floor was set for expectations of 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;good behaviour&rsquo; by companies in Denmark and abroad, not least facilitated by the 
</p>
<p>growing adoption of the UN Global Compact&rsquo;s principles for responsible business.
</p>
<p>In 2010 Novo Nordisk framed a new strategy that would divert from the issues- 
</p>
<p>based approach of the past decade, described in the case. Now focus would be on 
</p>
<p>continuing the integration by making the business case to demonstrate how the 
</p>
<p>Triple Bottom Line approach generates value&nbsp;&ndash; for the business and for stakehold-
</p>
<p>ers. As it happened, this was an act of foresight; the efforts preceded the concept of 
</p>
<p>shared value articulated by Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, 
</p>
<p>which gained significant traction in boardrooms and business school classrooms.
</p>
<p>The strategy was to create, capture and communicate value by using the Triple 
</p>
<p>Bottom Line. To articulate an approach that combined rationales such as retaining 
</p>
<p>the social contract (licence to operate), promoting smarter and more sustainable 
</p>
<p>solutions (competitiveness) and experimenting with innovative and collaborative 
</p>
<p>initiatives to address systemic challenges (game changers). And, most importantly, 
</p>
<p>to bring it all to life in everyday practice, so that there would be consistency between 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;what we say&rsquo; and &lsquo;what we do&rsquo;. And it appeared to be successful, for as the 
</p>
<p>30 The Ongoing Dynamics of Integrating Sustainability into Business Practice&hellip;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>656
</p>
<p>business continued to grow, so did the company&rsquo;s reputation, brand value and influ-
</p>
<p>ence. Still, it was important to have a team to support, align and drive efforts to be a 
</p>
<p>sustainable business. And, importantly, with a mandate to challenge current prac-
</p>
<p>tices. That was, and is, the role of the Corporate Sustainability team.
</p>
<p>Many lessons have been learnt, and although by now almost a clich&eacute;, one should 
</p>
<p>be reminded that sustainability is a journey with no end destination. To Novo 
</p>
<p>Nordisk, sustainable business means prospering as a result of doing business that is 
</p>
<p>responsible and profitable. This is what guides decision-making, and this is what is 
</p>
<p>built into the performance management and reward systems described in this case. 
</p>
<p>Then and now.

<p> Appendix 3: Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s Vision, Values, Commitments 
and&nbsp;Fundamentals
</p>
<p>The Vision
</p>
<p>We want to be the world&rsquo;s leader in diabetes treatment
</p>
<p>We offer products and services in other areas where we can make a difference
</p>
<p>We deliver competitive business results
</p>
<p>A job with us is more than &ldquo;just a job&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Our values are reflected in our actions
</p>
<p>Our history shows that it can be done
</p>
<p>The Values are six corporate values to guide decision-making and action: 
</p>
<p>accountable, ambitious, responsible, engaged with stakeholders, open and honest, 
</p>
<p>ready for change.
</p>
<p>The Commitments are a reflection of the commitment to sustainability and to 
</p>
<p>integrating the Triple Bottom Line thinking in organisational practices.
</p>
<p>The Fundamentals consist of ten behavioural guidelines on how to organize and 
</p>
<p>behave in everyday organisational life in all units at all levels in Novo Nordisk:
</p>
<p> 1. Each unit must share and use better practices.
</p>
<p> 2. Each unit must have a clear definition of where accountabilities and decision 
</p>
<p>powers recide
</p>
<p> 3. Each unit must have an action plan to ensure improvement of its busienss and 
</p>
<p>performance and working climate
</p>
<p> 4. Every team and employee must have updated business and competency targets 
</p>
<p>and receive timely feedback on performance against these targest
</p>
<p> 5. Each unit must have an action plan to ensure the development of teams and 
</p>
<p>individuals based on busienss requirements and employee input.
</p>
<p> 6. Every manager must establish and maintain procedures in the unit for living up 
</p>
<p>to relevant laws, regulations, and Novo Nordisk policies
</p>
<p> 7. Each unit and employee must know how they create value for their customers
</p>
<p> 8. Every manager requring reporting from others must explain the actual use of 
</p>
<p>the report and the added value
</p>
<p> 9. Every manager must continuously make it easier for the employees to liberate 
</p>
<p>energy for customer related issues.
</p>
<p> 10. Every manager and unit must actively support cross-unit projects and working 
</p>
<p>relationships of relevance to the business

<p> Appendix 4: Example of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Facilitation
</p>
<p>Following are excerpts from a recent facilitation at Diabetes Pharmaceutical Site 
</p>
<p>Hiller&oslash;d:
</p>
<p>Facilitation Start Date: 15 November 2004
</p>
<p>Facilitation End Date: 22 December 2004
</p>
<p>Purpose and Scope of Facilitation
</p>
<p>The purpose and scope of the facilitation is to assess the state of compliance, within 
</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Diabetes Site Hiller&oslash;d, with the Novo Nordisk Way of Management, 
</p>
<p>excluding Financial Commitments, and to agree and follow up on actions resulting 
</p>
<p>from the facilitation and to report the results.
</p>
<p>At the time of the facilitation the organisation is influenced by a number of 
</p>
<p>changes. The unit VP and the QA (quality assurance) VP were appointed in the Q4 
</p>
<p>2004 and several department managers have been appointed to their current position 
</p>
<p>within 2004.
</p>
<p>Executive Summary
</p>
<p>The facilitation of DPSH in&nbsp;Site Hiller&oslash;d has shown a unit dedicated to live up to 
</p>
<p>the targets and challenges set by Diabetes Finished Products (DFP). All interview-
</p>
<p>ees were aware of Novo Nordisk Way of management and feel that the unit and 
</p>
<p>management are living up to the values of Novo Nordisk. Facilitations show that 
</p>
<p>there are different levels of compliance amongst the departments with respect to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of Fundamentals.
</p>
<p>The unit is highly focused on achieving its business targets, sometimes at the 
</p>
<p>expense of overlooking the quality of some of the management processes such as 
</p>
<p>APIS and development planning.
</p>
<p>DPSH is currently developing its own strategy in alignment with DFP strategy 
</p>
<p>and business plans. There is a clear understanding by all in the unit that focus must 
</p>
<p>be on supporting the needs defined in the production agreements. Roll out of 
</p>
<p>cLEAN&trade; is at variable stages within the different functions within DPSH.
</p>
<p>Target setting based on the DPSH Balanced Scorecard and follow up needs to be 
</p>
<p>improved for both teams and individuals. The lack of specific targets in some teams 
</p>
<p>also influences the frequency and quality of feedback given in the organisation and 
</p>
<p>needs to be enhanced.
</p>
<p>DPSH is as an organisation in close daily contact with its key stakeholders within 
</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk and interviewees are aware of their customers needs.

</p>
<p>Strategic area Indicators Impact
</p>
<p>Living our values
</p>
<p>Two indicators show how we 
live up to the company&rsquo;s 
values, as perceived by 
employees. This is measured 
as part of the climate survey, 
eVoice, conducted annualy. 
One indicator showws 
follow-up on the facilitation 
process.
</p>
<p>Average of respondents&rsquo; answers 
as to whether social and 
environmental issues are important 
for the future of the company.
</p>
<p>Organisational support 
for and understanding 
of responsible business 
practices.
</p>
<p>Average of respondents&rsquo; answers 
as to whether management 
demonstrates in words and action 
that they live up to our values.

<p>Percent of fulfilment of action 
points planned arising from 
facilitations of the Novo Nordisk 
way of management and values
</p>
<p>Corrective actions on 
values following 
facilitations.
</p>
<p>Access to health
</p>
<p>Two indicators measure 
progress on one of the 
programmes for global access 
to health, the best possible 
pricing scheme in least 
developed countries (LDCs). 
In 2004 there were 50 LDCs.
</p>
<p>Number of LDCs where Novo 
Nordisk operates.
</p>
<p>Access to essential 
medicines.
</p>
<p>Number of LDCs which have 
chosen to buy insulin under the 
best possible pricing scheme.
</p>
<p>Affordability of 
essential medicines.
</p>
<p>Our employees
</p>
<p>Four indicators measure 
standards of health and safety 
in the workplace, employee 
development and equal 
opportunities.
</p>
<p>Frequency of occupational 
injuries.
</p>
<p>Increased quality of life 
for employees, 
improved work flow 
and productivity, and 
less absence due to 
illness.
</p>
<p>Employee turnover rate. Influx and outflux of 
knowledge.
</p>
<p>Average of respondents&rsquo; answers 
as to whether their work gives 
them an opportunity to use and 
develop their competences/skills.
</p>
<p>Increased competence 
level for employees and 
increase competence 
capital in the company.
</p>
<p>Average of respondents&rsquo; answers 
as to whether people from diverse 
backgrounds have equal 
opportunities (for example in 
terms of hiring, promotion and 
training) at Novo Nordisk, 
regardless of gender, race, ways of 
thinking etc.

<p>31The Changing Role of&nbsp;Business Leaders, and&nbsp;Implications for&nbsp;Talent Management 
and&nbsp;Executive Education
</p>
<p>Matthew&nbsp;Gitsham
</p>
<p>It may have been happening quietly in the background without attracting much 
</p>
<p>attention, but look around and you&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s been a fundamental development 
</p>
<p>in the scope of the role business leaders are required to play for their businesses to 
</p>
<p>survive and thrive in today&rsquo;s turbulent, uncertain and volatile times.
</p>
<p> Putting Creating Value for&nbsp;People at&nbsp;the Heart of&nbsp;Strategic 
Goals
</p>
<p>In recent years more and more organisations have been formulating goals in terms 
</p>
<p>of the problems and needs they will help address in society. Rather than articulating 
</p>
<p>goals solely in terms of the financial value that will be created for shareholders, 
</p>
<p>they have been instead defining goals in terms of the value they will create for 
</p>
<p>people&nbsp;&ndash; end consumers and wider stakeholders&nbsp;&ndash; which will allow them to create 
</p>
<p>value for shareholders in the process. Think of Unilever announcing in 2010 that to 
</p>
<p>meet its aim to double the size of its business in 10&nbsp;years, it would focus on strategic 
</p>
<p>goals including helping a billion people improve their hygiene, bringing safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water to 500 million, and halving the greenhouse gas impact of their 
</p>
<p>products across their lifecycle. Or Philips&rsquo; strategic goal to improve the lives of 3bn 
</p>
<p>people a year by 2025, Kingfisher&rsquo;s strategic goal to make it easier for their customers 
</p>
<p>to have better and more sustainable homes, GSK&rsquo;s goal to improve the quality of 
</p>
<p>human life by enabling people to do more, feel better and live longer. While still 
</p>
<p>only a minority, the number of companies framing their purpose and future activities 
</p>
<p>in these terms is growing fast.</p>

</p>
<p> Fundamental Shifts
</p>
<p>Although these kinds of strategic goals are a recent phenomenon, what we&rsquo;re seeing 
</p>
<p>is the outcome of some much longer term trends.
</p>
<p>Think back to the 1970s. The prevailing view was that government leaders dealt 
</p>
<p>with society&rsquo;s challenges. For business leaders, what it took to survive and thrive 
</p>
<p>was to keep their eyes squarely on their industry and focus on making money. 
</p>
<p>Broader societal issues were seen as none of their business, and to get involved 
</p>
<p>would only add cost.
</p>
<p>Fast forward to the 2010s and much has changed. Not only have civil society 
</p>
<p>organisations become much more influential, but so has a much more globally- 
</p>
<p>integrated private sector. In 1970, the world&rsquo;s biggest economic entities were all 
</p>
<p>countries, but now a sizeable number of them are private companies.1 Now there is 
</p>
<p>a widespread view that most big challenges are pretty hard for governments to 
</p>
<p>address on their own, and that a much wider group of actors need to be at the table.
</p>
<p>CEOs&rsquo; thinking about fundamental business models has been changing too. The 
</p>
<p>1980s saw business adopt the model of &lsquo;maximising shareholder value&rsquo;, as a way of 
</p>
<p>fixing some of the problems of poor profitability in the 1970s.2 But as business lead-
</p>
<p>ers have seen first-hand the weaknesses of this model become clearer in the past few 
</p>
<p>years, many have begun experimenting with alternatives, like Michael Porter&rsquo;s &lsquo;cre-
</p>
<p>ating shared value&rsquo; model.3 For business leaders to survive and thrive in today&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>world means developing strategies that focus primarily on creating value for wider 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to ensure they generate return for shareholders in the medium and long 
</p>
<p>term as well as the next quarter.
</p>
<p>All these shifts have had some pretty fundamental implications for the kind of 
</p>
<p>leadership role senior executives are now finding themselves having to play.
</p>
<p> A More Collaborative Leadership Role at the&nbsp;Heart of&nbsp;Society
</p>
<p>The much greater economic clout and influence of globally-integrated business has 
</p>
<p>thrust business leaders, whether they like it or not, into a far more overtly &lsquo;political&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>kind of role on the world stage&nbsp;&ndash; you might say as much &lsquo;statesman&rsquo; as &lsquo;business-
</p>
<p>man&rsquo; (leaving aside the unfortunately gendered nature of these terms).
</p>
<p>There have been plenty of business leaders over the past decade or so who did not 
</p>
<p>recognise how these forces had started to shift the ground under their feet and what 
</p>
<p>this meant for how they needed to play the role of business leader differently, and

<p>got themselves and their companies into trouble as a result&nbsp;&ndash; remember former Nike 
</p>
<p>CEO Phil Knight trying to defend sweatshop labour, former GSK CEO Jean-Pierre 
</p>
<p>Garnier leading the pharma industry in suing Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s government over 
</p>
<p>access to medicines, former BP CEO Tony Hayward thinking it was a good idea to 
</p>
<p>call the Gulf of Mexico oil spill &lsquo;relatively tiny&rsquo;, or Google CEO Eric Schmidt try-
</p>
<p>ing to defend tax avoidance. These leaders did not recognise how the balance of 
</p>
<p>power between government and business has shifted and what that means for how 
</p>
<p>they need to play their role differently.
</p>
<p>But in the past few years, more and more business leaders seem to be embracing 
</p>
<p>this new scope to the senior executive&rsquo;s role that comes with leading the fundamen-
</p>
<p>tally more influential kind of institution business has become, whether it be:
</p>
<p> &ndash; Unilever CEO Paul Polman sitting on a UN High Level Panel with presidents, 
</p>
<p>prime ministers and the UN Secretary General to help shape the UN Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Kingfisher CEO Ian Cheshire chairing the UK Corporate Leaders Group on 
</p>
<p>Climate Change, lobbying for stronger government policy on the low carbon 
</p>
<p>economy.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Sainsburys CEO Justin King speaking out on tax avoidance, challenging his 
</p>
<p>peers in other industries to contribute a fair rate of tax in the countries where they 
</p>
<p>benefit from investments in infrastructure and communities.
</p>
<p> &ndash; GSK CEO Andrew Witty partnering with NGO Save the Children on innovation 
</p>
<p>in child-friendly medicines and reinvesting 20% of profits made in the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>least developed countries back into projects which strengthen healthcare infra-
</p>
<p>structure in those countries, primarily through training community health 
</p>
<p>workers.
</p>
<p>Playing this new kind of leadership role well isn&rsquo;t some kind of vanity project 
</p>
<p>aimed at securing a knighthood. It has emerged in response to fundamental shifts in 
</p>
<p>global geopolitics&nbsp;&ndash; and an ability for business leaders to play this role well has 
</p>
<p>increasingly become a key variable in the success or failure of both their organisa-
</p>
<p>tions and wider society. A vanguard of today&rsquo;s CEOs are now playing this role well. 
</p>
<p>Others still need to learn, and learn fast.
</p>
<p> What&rsquo;s Required to&nbsp;Be&nbsp;Able to&nbsp;Play This New Role Well?
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been leading a programme of research around this at Ashridge Business 
</p>
<p>School for a number of years now, partnering with networks like the Academy of 
</p>
<p>Business in Society, the UN Global Compact, and the International Business 
</p>
<p>Leaders&rsquo; Forum. We&rsquo;ve been talking with some of the CEOs who&rsquo;ve been at the 
</p>
<p>forefront of this trend&nbsp;&ndash; people like Neville Isdell, former Chairman &amp; CEO of the 
</p>
<p>Coca Cola Company; Paul Walsh, CEO of Diageo; John Brock, Chairman &amp; CEO 
</p>
<p>of Coca Cola Enterprises; Lord Browne, former CEO of BP; Sir Mark Moody

</p>
<p>Chairman of IMC Pan Asia Alliance Group; Carolyn McCall, CEO of easyJet; and 
</p>
<p>Mark Foster, former Group Chief Executive, Accenture. We asked them what their 
</p>
<p>experience said about how the role of a business leader is different now from what 
</p>
<p>it was in the past. Their experiences can be summed up in three themes: context, 
</p>
<p>complexity and connectedness.
</p>
<p>Context: understanding the strategic implications of societal trends, and devel-
</p>
<p>oping a broader view on the role of business leaders in society
</p>
<p>What is clear from their experiences is that it is essential that business leaders 
</p>
<p>today have a nuanced understanding of the major societal forces shaping our world 
</p>
<p>and a genuine personal passion for running a profitable business out of serving the 
</p>
<p>interests of wider society; that helping address societal challenges through their 
</p>
<p>core business is the primary means by which they create value, not a source of cost, 
</p>
<p>and at the heart of their job description&nbsp;&ndash; a quite different view on the role of a busi-
</p>
<p>ness leader compared with the norm of a generation ago.
</p>
<p>Mark Foster, former Group Chief Executive at Accenture, summed up how his 
</p>
<p>thinking about his role had changed like this:
</p>
<p>The journey I&rsquo;d been on was first of all an understanding that there was a world out there 
</p>
<p>above and beyond the piece of business you&rsquo;re in. The second thing is then a movement 
</p>
<p>from business challenges to global challenges. And then you move into asking: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the 
</p>
<p>role we&rsquo;re playing in participating in those challenges?&rsquo; And then, &lsquo;What can we do about 
</p>
<p>it?&rsquo; As a business, both in terms of the business opportunity and secondly, the broader ethi-
</p>
<p>cal engagement with the world and what you see around you&rdquo;.5
</p>
<p>John Brock, Chairman and CEO of Coca Cola Enterprises argued:
</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world I don&rsquo;t think you have a choice. If you&rsquo;re going to be an effective leader 
</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve really got to be driving all aspects of sustainability as part of what you&rsquo;re doing, 
</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do and because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do for the business &hellip; If 
</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not personally persuaded then you&rsquo;ve got a little bit of an issue, and maybe there are 
</p>
<p>some people in that category, in which case I think leading&nbsp;&ndash; in some hypocritical sense&nbsp;&ndash; is 
</p>
<p>quite hard to do. It helps a lot if you&rsquo;ve got the personal passion and commitment.6

<p>Sir Stuart Rose, former CEO and Executive Chairman of Marks&amp;Spencers, 
</p>
<p>spoke about the significance of the changing balance of governments and companies: 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 100 largest financial entities in the world used to be governments. Now over 
</p>
<p>50 of them are businesses, so suddenly the whole scale in the world has changed, 
</p>
<p>and businesses have become much more important than they used to be.&rdquo;7
</p>
<p>For Sir Stuart, the commercial implications of this, and case for acting differently 
</p>
<p>was clear:
</p>
<p>In 2007 I said Plan A wouldn&rsquo;t make any profit in the first five years. In the 2010 annual 
</p>
<p>report, &pound;50million of extra profit was attributable to doing the right thing. So there&rsquo;s the 
</p>
<p>proof. Any chief executive that says: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to do it, I haven&rsquo;t got the people, it&rsquo;s all 
</p>
<p>too expensive, the consumers don&rsquo;t want it, they haven&rsquo;t asked me for it, it&rsquo;s the wrong thing 
</p>
<p>to do and it&rsquo;s going to cost me money&rsquo; is wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong.8
</p>
<p>The senior executives we spoke with were also clear that doing this well means 
</p>
<p>getting involved in activities that require a different skill set. Not only are senior 
</p>
<p>executives now playing some very specific roles in leading innovation and change 
</p>
<p>within their own organisations to drive the execution of shared value strategies, 
</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also now playing a much more significant leadership role in wider society 
</p>
<p>too.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Complexity: a leader&rsquo;s role in leading change in organisations
</p>
<p>Organisations don&rsquo;t change because one individual says so, they are complex 
</p>
<p>communities of relationships where people&rsquo;s decisions and actions are guided by 
</p>
<p>multiple different influences. The chief executives we spoke to talked of seeing their 
</p>
<p>own role in influencing change in their organisations in terms of opening up the 
</p>
<p>space for others to behave differently&nbsp;&ndash; through the goals they articulated and the

</p>
<p>rationales they developed for pursuing them, the stories and people they celebrated, 
</p>
<p>the conversations they started, the questions they asked, what they were seen to 
</p>
<p>spend their own time doing, and which individuals and groups got recognised and 
</p>
<p>rewarded and for what.
</p>
<p>Paul Walsh, CEO of Diageo, talked about the significance of the questions he 
</p>
<p>asked in leading change: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how word gets around. I&rsquo;m a great believer 
</p>
<p>that if I want to focus the organization on X I just walk round the organization and 
</p>
<p>I ask about X.&nbsp;And the word gets out.&rdquo;10
</p>
<p>For Mark Foster, the significance of how he was seen to spend his time was 
</p>
<p>important: &ldquo;I would try and give a week a year to Accenture Development 
</p>
<p>Partnerships for them to send me somewhere and engage with their programmes, as 
</p>
<p>a very clear signal to the organisation that I thought this mattered.&rdquo;11
</p>
<p>Carolyn McCall talked about the CEO&rsquo;s role in empowering more junior employ-
</p>
<p>ees to play leadership roles in change, and challenging more senior leaders not to 
</p>
<p>discourage them: &ldquo;I got younger people involved, I got champions in each of the 
</p>
<p>divisions, and they started driving things rather than the more senior leaders. All I 
</p>
<p>said to the senior leaders was &lsquo;What I need is for you not to be an obstacle.&rsquo; I wanted 
</p>
<p>them not to be blockers. I wanted them to also not roll their eyes, because a lot of it 
</p>
<p>is body language.&rdquo;12
</p>
<p>Lord Browne argued that to sustain the right kind of behaviours, people had to 
</p>
<p>know that they would receive some kind of recognition, whether that be financial, a 
</p>
<p>promotion, or just a sense of wellbeing that comes from being highly regarded by 
</p>
<p>their peers. &ldquo;The biggest thing about getting anything done in an organization of 
</p>
<p>course is to really get to the point where everyone in the organization owns the 
</p>
<p>objective as if it&rsquo;s their own, and they recognize that by achieving the objective 
</p>
<p>something good will happen to them. And these statements are as old as the hills but 
</p>
<p>you must never ever forget them.&rdquo;13

<p>Connectedness: a leader&rsquo;s role in leading change in wider society
</p>
<p>A number of the interviewees also identified an important change in the scope of 
</p>
<p>their work. More and more they now see it as their role to lead beyond the traditional 
</p>
<p>boundaries of their organisation, proactively leading change in consumer and sup-
</p>
<p>plier behaviour, industry norms and government policy, for the mutual benefit of 
</p>
<p>their organisations and wider society. Some are leading collaboratively with industry 
</p>
<p>competitors, NGOs and government where challenges need to be tackled and only 
</p>
<p>collective, systemic solutions will do.
</p>
<p>This new horizon to their role has required leaders to develop skill in areas that 
</p>
<p>historically have not been a conventional part of the business leader&rsquo;s repertoire: 
</p>
<p>contributing to public debate with an informed point of view, proactively leading 
</p>
<p>change in consumer and supplier behaviour, industry norms and government policy, 
</p>
<p>relating well with multiple constituencies, engaging in dialogue to understand and 
</p>
<p>empathise with groups and communities with perspectives contrary to one&rsquo;s own, 
</p>
<p>and engaging in multi-stakeholder collaboration with unconventional partners.
</p>
<p>John Brock, Chairman and CEO of Coca Cola Enterprises talked about the 
</p>
<p>change like this:

</p>
<p>I think the role of a business leader today is much more challenging because you&rsquo;ve got so 
</p>
<p>many other constituencies out there that you didn&rsquo;t have before. Certainly the hierarchical 
</p>
<p>approach&nbsp;&ndash; let&rsquo;s just lead from the top and if other people don&rsquo;t like it, that&rsquo;s their problem&nbsp;&ndash; 
</p>
<p>that does not work anymore. You&rsquo;ve got to engage with these multiple constituencies and 
</p>
<p>make decisions in a more consensual way. And that requires a real skill. As the leading 
</p>
<p>drinks manufacturer in several countries, and as a major player in the industry itself, we 
</p>
<p>believe we have an important leadership role to try to figure out how to bring government, 
</p>
<p>NGOs, and industry all along. We as a company will invest a huge amount of time. And not 
</p>
<p>just me, our whole leadership team.15
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> What Does It Mean for&nbsp;Talent Management and&nbsp;Executive 
Education?
</p>
<p>Getting this new leadership role right has become key to whether an organisation 
</p>
<p>(and wider society for that matter) survives and thrives in today&rsquo;s turbulent, uncer-
</p>
<p>tain and volatile times. But the extent to which organisations have ended up with 
</p>
<p>leaders that can do this well (or not) has to date been more to do with good (or bad) 
</p>
<p>luck, rather than by design. As Paul Polman notes, few of today&rsquo;s generation of busi-
</p>
<p>ness leaders have been trained for this:
</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think our fiduciary duty is to put shareholders first. I say the opposite. What we 
</p>
<p>firmly believe is that if we focus our company on improving the lives of the world&rsquo;s citizens 
</p>
<p>and come up with genuine sustainable solutions, we are more in synch with consumers and 
</p>
<p>society and ultimately this will result in good shareholder returns&hellip; It is an enormous learn-
</p>
<p>ing curve as no one has been trained for this.16

</p>
<p>As a result, this same new generation of business leaders has started to recognise 
</p>
<p>that their organisations need to start taking a more systematic approach to the selec-
</p>
<p>tion and development of the groups of executives handed the responsibility of senior 
</p>
<p>decision-making roles. Their organisations need to deliberately build the right kind 
</p>
<p>of leadership capability and cultural norms to be able to survive and thrive in this 
</p>
<p>new context.
</p>
<p>Clearly, today&rsquo;s business leaders need a much more thorough literacy in global 
</p>
<p>issues and their business implications, as well as the motivation and commitment to 
</p>
<p>put acting on this at the heart of their work, and a different level of relational skill to 
</p>
<p>lead change inside and beyond their organisations. But how do you achieve this? 
</p>
<p>How come some business leaders get it and others don&rsquo;t?
</p>
<p>We asked some of these leaders for their perspectives on how it was that they and 
</p>
<p>some of their peers had grasped the need to lead in this kind of way while many of their 
</p>
<p>other contemporaries were still operating from an out-of-date leadership blueprint.
</p>
<p>While each individual&rsquo;s story was unique, the clear theme was that certain key 
</p>
<p>experiences had been crucial in influencing and shifting perspectives. For some it 
</p>
<p>was formative experiences around upbringing, university and business school study. 
</p>
<p>For others it was influential mentors or first-hand experiences like engaging with 
</p>
<p>people living in poverty, personal experience of challenges like water stress or the 
</p>
<p>impacts of climate change, or personal first-hand experiences of the changing inter-
</p>
<p>ests of key stakeholders.
</p>
<p>For Neville Isdell, the former CEO of The Coca Cola Company, an influential 
</p>
<p>sociology professor, student activism and training as a social worker in Cape Town&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Cape Flats shanty towns in the polarised atmosphere of 1960s South Africa was a 
</p>
<p>potent combination that shaped the positions he took once CEO on issues like human 
</p>
<p>rights, climate change and water scarcity. &ldquo;I majored in sociology at university in 
</p>
<p>South Africa and I qualified as a social worker. I was also involved in student politics 
</p>
<p>and I stood for the Student Council on an anti-apartheid ticket. So I started out with 
</p>
<p>a frame of reference which was a little different from your average business leader.&rdquo;17
</p>
<p>Mark Foster talked about the influence on him of Accenture&rsquo;s International 
</p>
<p>Chair, Vernon Ellis. &ldquo;I became interested in these topics by being exposed to others 
</p>
<p>who were fairly passionate about it. They made you think about things you hadn&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>previously thought about.&rdquo;18
</p>
<p>Paul Walsh talked about the powerful impact of being exposed to the realities of 
</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s lives in water-stressed parts of the world where Diageo does business. &ldquo;I 
</p>
<p>remember opening a borehole project in Lagos, in one of the terrible slum areas, and 
</p>
<p>seeing these children flick water at each other. It was almost as if they were playing 
</p>
<p>with a Christmas gift. It was incredible. Just flicking it in each other&rsquo;s face and 
</p>
<p>giggling.&rdquo;19

<p>31 The Changing Role of&nbsp;Business Leaders, and&nbsp;Implications for&nbsp;Talent Management&hellip;</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p> Selecting and&nbsp;Developing Today&rsquo;s and&nbsp;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Senior 
Executives
</p>
<p>These stories have important implications for how organisations think about talent 
</p>
<p>management and executive education. They suggest that more is required than just 
</p>
<p>briefings and lectures on global trends and their commercial implications&nbsp;&ndash; relation-
</p>
<p>ships and first hand experiences are at the heart of what it takes for business leaders 
</p>
<p>to build the emotional connection and commitment to put this agenda front and 
</p>
<p>centre of their work. Therefore to foster the right kind of leadership capability in 
</p>
<p>their organisations, HR, Learning and Development, and Organisation Development 
</p>
<p>teams need to do more of the following:
</p>
<p> 1. Value these kinds of life experiences when making decisions about recruit-
</p>
<p>ment, career development and succession planning, and make sure they are 
</p>
<p>embedded in the HR processes that underpin these.
</p>
<p>If personal, first-hand experience like engaging with people living in poverty, 
</p>
<p>personal experience of challenges like water stress or the impacts of climate 
</p>
<p>change, or personal first-hand experiences of the changing interests of key stake-
</p>
<p>holders are key in stimulating the required kind of business leadership for the 
</p>
<p>current era, then these kinds of experiences need to be deliberately encouraged, 
</p>
<p>valued and sought after in recruitment, career development planning, the identi-
</p>
<p>fication of high potentials and succession planning. Not because they are &lsquo;nice- 
</p>
<p>to- haves&rsquo; that demonstrate a rounded individual, but because of the crucial 
</p>
<p>contribution they make to developing a worldview, relational ability and organ-
</p>
<p>isational culture now essential for organisations to survive and thrive.
</p>
<p>This will require being mindful about deliberately looking for something dif-
</p>
<p>ferent in the moment of making these decisions about recruitment, career devel-
</p>
<p>opment planning, high potentials and succession planning, and perhaps 
</p>
<p>challenging a tendency to recruit in your own image by hiring based on what 
</p>
<p>worked in the past. It will also require reassessing and, where necessary, 
</p>
<p> reformulating the kinds of HR processes and indicators that supply the manage-
</p>
<p>ment information sometimes used when making these decisions.
</p>
<p> 2. Embed the opportunities to have these kinds of experiences in leadership 
</p>
<p>development and executive education.
</p>
<p>Our research with organisations like IBM, HSBC, Lend Lease, IMC Group and oth-
</p>
<p>ers20 suggests that more and more organisations are structuring their leadership 
</p>
<p>development activities to create opportunities for their current and future senior 
</p>
<p>leader to have precisely these kinds of personal, first-hand experiences. To 
</p>
<p>achieve this, they are employing powerful experiential learning that:

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p> &ndash; Give senior executives the chance to develop relationships with people experi-
</p>
<p>encing some of the world&rsquo;s most pressing challenges, and also with people work-
</p>
<p>ing to help address these challenges.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Give them a chance to engage with new ideas to help make sense of the demands 
</p>
<p>of this new business context like ecology, complexity, systems thinking and 
</p>
<p>social constructionism, and how these link with business language through new 
</p>
<p>concepts like &lsquo;shared value&rsquo;, &lsquo;brand substance&rsquo;, &lsquo;closed loop manufacturing&rsquo; and 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;integrated reporting&rsquo;.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Support them to make their own sense of these experiences and relate them to 
</p>
<p>their organisational roles through action learning, business challenge strategic 
</p>
<p>projects and exposure to individuals in their own organisations already model-
</p>
<p>ling this way of leading.
</p>
<p> &ndash; Help them develop and articulate their own authentically held view on the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of their work, and the value it creates for wider society.
</p>
<p>Take Dutch multinational Philips for example. In their leadership development 
</p>
<p>work in partnership with Ashridge Business School, between residential modules 
</p>
<p>participants engage in strategic projects to develop new commercial propositions 
</p>
<p>which help contribute to achieving the goal of the organisation&rsquo;s strategy: to improve 
</p>
<p>the lives of three billion people a year by 2025.
</p>
<p>One recent learning project challenged participants to develop proposals for 
</p>
<p>serving rural communities in India with good business case potential and the ability 
</p>
<p>to scale up. After spending time engaging first-hand with women in rural Indian 
</p>
<p>communities and health professionals and NGOs, the team developed an idea to use 
</p>
<p>mobile communications technology to support remote diagnosis.
</p>
<p>The result has become a thriving public-private partnership involving Philips, 
</p>
<p>government and NGO partners. Health professionals now travel among rural 
</p>
<p>communities with portable ultrasound, X-Ray and ECG testing equipment 
</p>
<p>and send test results electronically to specialists in distant hospitals using mobile 
</p>
<p>technology, who then liaise with the health professionals to discuss diagnosis via 
</p>
<p>video-conference.
</p>
<p>Singapore-based shipping conglomerate IMC Group is another example. 
</p>
<p>Working with partners from the Global Institute for Tomorrow, the IMC Integrated 
</p>
<p>Leadership Programme for high potentials in the organisation involves a week of 
</p>
<p>classroom-based learning exploring socio-political and environmental trends, sus-
</p>
<p>tainable development and business, followed by a week of experiential immersion 
</p>
<p>learning, tasking participants to develop a strategy that embraces the principles of 
</p>
<p>sustainable development for a specific part of the business. The 2010 cohort devel-
</p>
<p>oped a strategic plan&nbsp;&ndash; embracing sustainability&nbsp;&ndash; for the IMC Palm Oil Plantations 
</p>
<p>business in Kalimantan, Indonesia after spending a week on the plantation, engag-
</p>
<p>ing with local management, local workers, families in&nbsp;local communities and ecolo-
</p>
<p>gists. Their plan was presented to the IMC Group Senior Management Team on the 
</p>
<p>final day of the programme.
</p>
<p>Similar approaches combining awareness raising with powerful first hand expe-
</p>
<p>riences and opportunities to form relationships with key stakeholder groups have

</p>
<p>been taken by numerous organisations. As part of their leadership development 
</p>
<p>programme, senior executives from British broadcaster Sky had to complete a 
</p>
<p>business challenge on sustainable livelihoods in the Brazilian Amazon, involving 
</p>
<p>first hand engagement with local government officials, NGOs and indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities. Senior executives at IBM work on strategic projects in emerging 
</p>
<p>markets partnering with NGOs, local government and local communities as part of 
</p>
<p>the IBM Corporate Service Corps leadership development programme. At HSBC, 
</p>
<p>senior executives have worked side by side with climate scientists at forest research 
</p>
<p>stations to build awareness, emotional connection and commitment to engaging 
</p>
<p>with climate change in their work.
</p>
<p>Numerous case studies now abound in fostering the kind of leadership capability 
</p>
<p>and cultural norms to create shared value, stimulated through leadership development 
</p>
<p>employing powerful experiential learning.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t call yourself a successful business leader in a failing world&rdquo;
</p>
<p>So said Feike Sijbesma, CEO of Dutch multi-national DSM at the UN Global 
</p>
<p>Compact Leaders Summit during the 2013 UN General Assembly.
</p>
<p>The role of business leaders has changed. So must how we select and develop 
</p>
<p>them.
