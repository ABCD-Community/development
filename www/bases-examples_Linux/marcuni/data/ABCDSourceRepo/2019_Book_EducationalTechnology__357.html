<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Educational technology is the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and
</p>
<p>improving performance by creating, using, and managing appropriate technological
</p>
<p>processes and resources. From the perspective of technology used in education,
</p>
<p>educational technology could be understood as the use of emerging and existing
</p>
<p>technologies to improve learning experiences in a variety of instructional settings,
</p>
<p>such as formal learning, informal learning, non-formal learning, lifelong learning,
</p>
<p>learning on demand, and just-in-time learning. Educational technology approaches
</p>
<p>have evolved from early uses of audiovisual aids to individual and networked
</p>
<p>computers, and now have evolved to include various mobile and smart technolo-
</p>
<p>gies, as well as virtual and augmented realities, avatar-based immersive environ-
</p>
<p>ments, cloud computing, and wearable and location-aware devices. Various terms
</p>
<p>have been used along the way to refer to educational technologies, such as learning
</p>
<p>technologies/environments and instructional technologies/systems. We have
</p>
<p>embraced a broad interpretation in this book to cover instructional design
</p>
<p>approaches, learning strategies, and hardware and software. Our view is that any-
</p>
<p>thing that consistently can support learning and instruction can be considered an
</p>
<p>educational technology. Some educational technologies are simple and have existed
</p>
<p>for many years; others are complex, and new ones are finding their way into
</p>
<p>educational settings every day.
</p>
<p>Educational technology focuses on both the technical and pedagogical ways and
</p>
<p>means of supporting learning and instruction. It is the basis for the success of the
</p>
<p>e-learning revolution in recent years. Technology-based instruction can surpass
</p>
<p>traditional classroom-based instruction in quality by providing a wide variety of
</p>
<p>affordances and capabilities that can promote motivation and result in engaging,
</p>
<p>efficient, and effective learning.
</p>
<p>The demand for educational technologies has been rising steadily; e-learning is a
</p>
<p>huge and expanding worldwide industry. Commercial e-learning companies,
</p>
<p>training departments in large companies and organizations, computer software
</p>
<p>companies, and educational institutions over the world employ large numbers of
</p>
<p>specialists in various aspects of educational technology creation (programming,
</p>
<p>graphic design, instructional design, task analysis, usability engineering, subject
</p>
<p>matter analysis, editing, etc.). However, these organizations often find it hard to
</p>
<p>employ suitably qualified workers who have knowledge beyond their subfields and
</p>
<p>disciplines. There is a strong demand for technologists who understand learning
</p>
<p>v</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>theories and for instructional designers and educators who understand technologies
</p>
<p>and how to effectively integrate technology into learning and instruction. The field
</p>
<p>of educational technology is becoming part of major educational programs in
</p>
<p>institutions worldwide. The commercial training industry is large and still going
</p>
<p>through a period of rapid and sustained growth, based in large part on the inte-
</p>
<p>gration of advanced digital technologies.
</p>
<p>The needs and requirements of the various organizations, both educational and
</p>
<p>commercial, vary widely in terms of the knowledge and skills needed to implement
</p>
<p>educational technology solutions effectively. Further complexity comes from the fact
</p>
<p>that potential students of educational technology exist at different levels and in a
</p>
<p>variety of contexts; potential students come from a variety of backgrounds, ranging
</p>
<p>from education, computing, engineering, design, arts, the humanities, finance, and the
</p>
<p>natural sciences. Their interests and expectations vary as widely as their aspirations
</p>
<p>toward what kind of organizations they would like to serve after their studies. The aim
</p>
<p>of this book is to prepare students with the knowledge and skills to understand the
</p>
<p>organizational needs and requirements, and not only use and manage existing and
</p>
<p>emerging technologies effectively, to be able to apply associated pedagogies and
</p>
<p>instructional strategies appropriately and effectively, to evaluate and manage edu-
</p>
<p>cational technology solutions, and to foresee and prepare for future possibilities.
</p>
<p>This book is targeted toward readers who are interested in educational tech-
</p>
<p>nology and would like to understand educational technology from different per-
</p>
<p>spectives. Specifically, this book could be used as textbook for two types of
</p>
<p>undergraduate students: (a) those who are looking for careers in educational tech-
</p>
<p>nology, instructional design, or media and information systems, or may want to
</p>
<p>continue their studies in graduate programs in learning and instructional technology
</p>
<p>and (b) those who are interested in becoming teachers in K-12 settings or trainers in
</p>
<p>industry and who need a strong background in educational technology. This book
</p>
<p>will also act as a valuable resource in teacher education programs where the primary
</p>
<p>focus on mainstream education requires an authentic resource in instructional
</p>
<p>design and educational technology.
</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the varied needs of the organizations, employees, and potential
</p>
<p>students, this book adopts a competency-based approach to learning and assess-
</p>
<p>ment. The themes and topics take a multi-disciplinary approach and are aimed at
</p>
<p>preparing students for competent and innovative educational technology profes-
</p>
<p>sionals. The approach taken in this book aligns with the recommendations of the
</p>
<p>suggested curricula for advanced learning technologies developed by a task force
</p>
<p>of the Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&rsquo; Technical Committee on
</p>
<p>Learning Technology led by Roger Hartley (with Kinshuk, Rob Koper, Toshio
</p>
<p>Okamoto, and Mike Spector) and published in 2010 (see http://www.ifets.info/

<p>Main Learning Activities
</p>
<p>1. According to Merrill, Tennyson, and Posey (1992), to teach a concept involves
</p>
<p>pointing out examples and non-examples, citing a rule or principle or criterion to
</p>
<p>distinguish examples from non-examples, and providing opportunities to prac-
</p>
<p>tice and get informative feedback. Given that context and the challenge to teach
</p>
<p>curious Cathy (an imaginary student) the concept &ldquo;educational technology,&rdquo; cite
</p>
<p>three examples and three non-examples of educational technologies that you
</p>
<p>could show Cathy, and also provide a rule, principle, or criterion which she
</p>
<p>could use to distinguish the examples from the non-examples.
</p>
<p>2. Select six additional items (some example and some non-examples), and ask
</p>
<p>Cathy to identify which are and which are not educational technologies. In each

<p>both a correct and an incorrect response.
</p>
<p>3. Suppose you are teaching a group of preservice teachers the first course on
</p>
<p>technology integration in learning and instruction and the first unit of instruction
</p>
<p>is on the history of educational technology.

<p>1.1 Introducing Educational Technology
</p>
<p>1.1.1 Purpose and Scope
</p>
<p>Educational technology refers to the use of tools, technologies, processes, proce-
</p>
<p>dures, resources, and strategies to improve learning experiences in a variety of
</p>
<p>settings, such as formal learning, informal learning, non-formal learning, lifelong
</p>
<p>learning, learning on demand, workplace learning, and just-in-time learning. Edu-
</p>
<p>cational technology approaches evolved from early uses of teaching tools and have
</p>
<p>rapidly expanded in recent years to include such devices and approaches as mobile
</p>
<p>technologies, virtual and augmented realities, simulations and immersive environ-
</p>
<p>ments, collaborative learning, social networking, cloud computing, flipped class-
</p>
<p>rooms, and more. This chapter provides a historical overview, key definitions and
</p>
<p>principles, various perspectives and representative developments, all of which will
</p>
<p>be explored and elaborated in subsequent chapters.
</p>
<p>The basic approach in this volume is competency-based. A competency is a
</p>
<p>collection of related knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that enable a person to
</p>
<p>perform a particular task. There are many tasks that educational technologists
</p>
<p>perform as part of their role and responsibilities. This primer provides an elabo-
</p>
<p>ration of many of these tasks and the associated KSAs that are common in the
</p>
<p>twenty-first century, while building a grounded rationale for them on the basis of
</p>
<p>prior work in learning psychology, computer developments, and human&ndash;human and
</p>
<p>human&ndash;computer interaction.
</p>
<p>Previous educational technology textbooks have focused primarily on knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and skills and have not emphasized attitudes and values as strongly as they are
</p>
<p>4 1 Introduction to Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>emphasized herein. The reason for emphasizing attitudes and values is that they
</p>
<p>play a critical role in motivation, and motivation is critical to success in nearly
</p>
<p>every human endeavor and especially critical in the challenging domain of edu-
</p>
<p>cational technology. The hope is that those who use this primer will develop an
</p>
<p>attitude exemplified by this statement: &ldquo;I know we can improve learning, instruction
</p>
<p>and performance in this situation.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>1.1.2 Initial Motivation
</p>
<p>Stories and other forms of narrative can be useful in providing context as well as
</p>
<p>motivation. Here is a story that actually occurred.
</p>
<p>This story involves a middle school student (Charlie) who was blind and par-
</p>
<p>tially deaf from birth. Charlie wanted to learn to swim during his summer vacation.
</p>
<p>A volunteer high school student lifeguard agreed to work with this student over a
</p>
<p>two-month period, three days a week, an hour or two each day. The student life-
</p>
<p>guard was told that Charlie probably never would learn to swim but just being in the
</p>
<p>pool and doing something enjoyable would be good for him. The first week or two
</p>
<p>served to confirm that advice. Charlie enjoyed being in the cool water on a hot
</p>
<p>summer day and spent most of the time walking around in the shallow part of the
</p>
<p>pool, occasionally dunking his head under water with the help of the lifeguard.
</p>
<p>After two weeks of getting used to being in the water, Charlie asked in difficult
</p>
<p>to understand broken words and gestures when he was going to learn to swim.
</p>
<p>Charlie wanted to swim. The lifeguard then decided to take Charlie&rsquo;s desire seri-
</p>
<p>ously, in spite of the parents saying not to try something so difficult for Charlie. The
</p>
<p>lessons started with kicking strokes with Charlie holding on to the edge of the pool
</p>
<p>and the lifeguard holding Charlie in a horizontal position. The following week, this
</p>
<p>was practiced in deeper water away from the edge of the pool. At the end of the first
</p>
<p>month, Charlie had learned how to say afloat for a few minutes by kicking his legs
</p>
<p>while in a vertical position in deeper water, with the lifeguard nearby to encourage
</p>
<p>him. The adult supervisor of the swimming lessons was somewhat surprised at
</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s progress and encouraged the lifeguard to continue.
</p>
<p>To shorten the story, at the end of the second month, Charlie was able to swim,
</p>
<p>somewhat awkwardly, from one side of the pool to the other&mdash;not the length of the
</p>
<p>pool, just the width which was about 10 m. The last day involved the parents of the
</p>
<p>children who had been taking swimming lessons. Charlie&rsquo;s parents came and were
</p>
<p>amazed to see him swim the width of the pool, which was something that no one
</p>
<p>really thought he would be able to do. Sometimes, one can do more than is expected
</p>
<p>by others. In this case, the local swimming community (including the lifeguard and
</p>
<p>swimming supervisor) supported Charlie&rsquo;s strong desire to learn to swim.
</p>
<p>The point of this story is to emphasize the role that desire plays in achieving
</p>
<p>outcomes. Desires need to be heard, accommodated, and supported to the extent
</p>
<p>that is reasonable in a given situation. From the instructor&rsquo;s perspective, the rele-
</p>
<p>vant attitude was to help the learner, Charlie, achieve his goal. Teachers and trainers
</p>
<p>can help learners develop an appropriate attitude&mdash;in this case, the desire to master
</p>
<p>1.1 Introducing Educational Technology 5</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a specific skill (swimming). Teachers and trainers then need to have a relevant
</p>
<p>attitude as well&mdash;namely, &ldquo;I can help the learner achieve this goal.&rdquo; The challenge
</p>
<p>is doubly complex for a person training swimming instructors as that person needs
</p>
<p>to understand and motivate the trainee keeping in mind the variety of students the
</p>
<p>trainee will need to understand and motivate.
</p>
<p>That kind of complexity is what often confronts educational technologists and
</p>
<p>instructional designers who deal with multiple kinds of people, resources, and
</p>
<p>situations. The challenges are real, and one goal of this book is to help develop the
</p>
<p>capacity to respond effectively to many challenges that will occur in a real-world
</p>
<p>setting.

<p>For the reader or learner: Find and read the &ldquo;Learning Stories&rdquo; on the
</p>
<p>Learning Development Institute Web site located at www.learndev.org (on the left
</p>
<p>menu, select Focus Areas of Activity and then select MOL or Meaning of Learning,
</p>
<p>and you can then select Learning Stories). Describe an engaging learning experi-
</p>
<p>ence of your own [the instructor may ask you to share that experience with others].
</p>
<p>1.1.3 Key Concepts
</p>
<p>&bull; Attitude&mdash;a mental disposition or way of thinking about something (place,
</p>
<p>person, event, activity, etc.); attitudes are linked to particular believers and their
</p>
<p>willingness to engage in particular activities
</p>
<p>&bull; Competency&mdash;a set of related knowledge, specific skills, and attitudes that
</p>
<p>enable a person to effectively perform a particular task
</p>
<p>&bull; Education&mdash;systematic efforts to develop (a) basic and specialized knowledge
</p>
<p>and skills, (b) problem-solving abilities, (c) productive workers, (d) higher-order
</p>
<p>reasoning capabilities, (d) responsible citizens, and/or (f) lifelong learners

</p>
<p>and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate
</p>
<p>technological processes and resources&rdquo; (AECT definition; Januszewski &amp;
</p>
<p>Molenda, 2008, p. 1); the disciplined use of pedagogical approaches, instruc-
</p>
<p>tional strategies, media, tools, and technologies to consistently improve learn-

</p>
<p>&bull; Learning&mdash;characterized by stable and persistent changes in what a person or
</p>
<p>group of people believe, know, and are able to do (Spector, 2015)
</p>
<p>&bull; Formal learning&mdash;structured sequences of instruction in support of intentional
</p>
<p>learning typically set in an institutional context with explicit goals and objectives

</p>
<p>&bull; Informal learning&mdash;learning that occurs outside the context of a formal setting;
</p>
<p>examples include field trips, museums, and incidental learning in the context of
</p>
<p>everyday activities; some informal learning activities and experiences are

<p>&bull; People learn what they do; this principle is derived from behavioral psychology

<p>support in neural science (e.g., when an action is repeated often, the neural
</p>
<p>connections in the brain associated with that action are strengthened, making it
</p>
<p>more likely to recur in the future); an implication of this basic principle is that
</p>
<p>learning activities should be designed with desired future performance in mind.

<p>&bull; The more time a person spends on a learning task, the more likely that person is
</p>
<p>to master the task.
</p>
<p>&bull; Providing timely and informative feedback while a learner is engaged in a
</p>
<p>learning task is likely to facilitate mastery of the task.
</p>
<p>These principles are integrated throughout this book and will hopefully become
</p>
<p>second nature to you as an educational technologist. In addition, it is well estab-
</p>
<p>lished that prior learning is generally predictive of future learning&mdash;that is to say,
</p>
<p>that learners who have struggled with a subject in the past are likely to continue to
</p>
<p>struggle. This implies that being aware of a learner&rsquo;s prior experiences and per-
</p>
<p>formance can help an instructor develop appropriate learning activities for that
</p>
<p>learner. Moreover, technology can play a key role in helping an instructor develop
</p>
<p>personalized and individually appropriate learning activities, as will be discussed in
</p>
<p>a later chapter.
</p>
<p>1.1.5 Defining Educational Technology
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;educational technology&rdquo; is widely used within the education profession
</p>
<p>as well as in the general population. It might seem like there is no need for a
</p>
<p>definition of such a commonly used term. However, such an assumption might be
</p>
<p>made for the everyday use of the term &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; and many other terms that
</p>
<p>identify areas of scholarly pursuit. As it happens in most of those cases, the various
</p>
<p>professional and scholarly communities have provided a specific definition of the
</p>
<p>term as a way to clarify the aims and scope of the discipline. In this case, we begin
</p>
<p>with the definition provided by the Association for Educational Communications
</p>
<p>and Technology (see www.aect.org): &ldquo;the study and ethical practice of facilitating
</p>
<p>learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate
</p>
<p>technological processes and resources&rdquo; (Januszewski &amp; Molenda, 2008, p. 1).
</p>
<p>In elaboration of the AECT definition, we note that designing, adapting, cus-
</p>
<p>tomizing, implementing, testing, deploying, and evaluating resources, activities,
</p>
<p>and learning and instructional tools intended to facilitate learning, performance, and
</p>
<p>instruction are included within the scope of the discipline. In addition, we
</p>
<p>emphasize the notion of practice in the definition for two reasons. First, it is directly
</p>
<p>aligned with the basic Greek derivation of the first term, techn&eacute;, involving the
</p>
<p>notion of skill. Second, throughout this volume there will be an emphasis on the
</p>
<p>effective use of a technology to support or facilitate learning, performance, and
</p>
<p>instruction. That notion aligns particularly with the second term, logos, involving
</p>
<p>the notion of reason. In ordinary terms, one might then say that educational tech-
</p>
<p>nology involves the reasoned and effective use of technology to support or facilitate
</p>
<p>learning, performance, and instruction.
</p>
<p>For the instructor: Ask, for examples, of educational technologies and then ask
</p>
<p>how an example satisfies or fits the definition above.
</p>
<p>The popular use of &ldquo;technology&rdquo; is in reference to physical things or things that
</p>
<p>one can touch, see, hear, taste, or smell. In computer science, the term &ldquo;technology&rdquo;
</p>
<p>8 1 Introduction to Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>often refers to both hardware and software, both of which can in principle be
</p>
<p>perceived one way or another. The AECT definition is not restricted to physical
</p>
<p>things or things that are perceivable as it refers to both processes and resources.
</p>
<p>Both will be discussed in this volume, consistent with the AECT definition. In
</p>
<p>many cases, however, we will use a separate term to refer to a process or collection
</p>
<p>of processes, such as instructional design or a pedagogical approach or a learning
</p>
<p>strategy all of which can be considered specific kinds of processes, with examples
</p>
<p>such as problem-based learning or flipping the classroom or hands-on training
</p>
<p>While many will associate learning and instruction with education, some might
</p>
<p>wonder why the definition includes performance. Definitions of &ldquo;learning&rdquo; and
</p>
<p>&ldquo;instruction&rdquo; are needed to make the inclusion of performance obvious. Learning is
</p>
<p>characterized by stable and persisting changes in what a person or group of people
</p>
<p>believe, know, and are able to do (adapted from Spector, 2015). Intentional learning
</p>
<p>is purposeful and goal-driven, which is common in formal learning situations.
</p>
<p>Instruction is comprised of those things and processes that are intended to support,
</p>
<p>facilitate, or enhance learning&mdash;intentional learning in this context (Gagn&eacute;, 1985;
</p>
<p>Gagn&eacute; &amp; Merrill, 1990; Merrill, 2002, 2013; Spector, 2015).
</p>
<p>The performance of learners is used to establish that a stable and persisting
</p>
<p>change has occurred, which is one reason to include performance within the pur-
</p>
<p>view of educational technology. It is an effective use of a technology that matters,
</p>
<p>and improving what learners know and can do is an indication of an effective use.
</p>
<p>Moreover, because an instruction consists of all those things aimed at improving
</p>
<p>learning, including those involved in designing and supporting learning, their
</p>
<p>performance is also relevant to the discipline of educational technology (Merrill,
</p>
<p>2007, 2013). A well-designed device or artifact used poorly or improperly by a
</p>
<p>teacher is not likely to support learning. Teacher performance and, as a conse-
</p>
<p>quence, teacher preparation and professional development in technology use are
</p>
<p>important. Likewise, a poorly designed learning environment may contain a wealth
</p>
<p>of information and resources, but a poor design can easily inhibit an effective use.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, the performance of instructional designers is also relevant to
</p>
<p>educational technology. Moreover, there is a discipline called &ldquo;performance tech-
</p>
<p>nology&rdquo; associated with human resource management (see http://www.bptrends.
</p>
<p>com/publicationfiles/02-06%20WP%20HPT%20-%20Tosti.pdf).
</p>
<p>Associated with the notion of performance in the context of effectiveness is the
</p>
<p>notion of efficiency, which can be linked to productivity. Both effectiveness and
</p>
<p>efficiency can be applied to learners, teachers, and designers (also to administrators,
</p>
<p>support personnel, and policy makers). Later in this volume, a great deal of
</p>
<p>emphasis will be placed on effective learning and things that are likely to contribute
</p>
<p>to effectiveness, such as learner motivation, engagement, empowerment, and timely
</p>
<p>and meaningful formative feedback.
</p>
<p>For the learner: Start an educational technology journal or diary (on paper or in
</p>
<p>digital format), and entitle a first entry &ldquo;a memorable learning experience that I
</p>
<p>consider effective, efficient, and engaging.&rdquo; Identify things in or about that expe-
</p>
<p>rience that are likely linked to its effectiveness. Can those things be introduced into

</p>
<p>elaborate and give an example.
</p>
<p>In summary, it is the effective use of technologies, tools, techniques, resources,
</p>
<p>and processes to support learning, performance, and instruction that is the focus of
</p>
<p>the discipline called educational technology. Table 1.1 provides an overview of this
</p>
<p>discussion.
</p>
<p>For the instructor: Ask students whether or not the slide rule is or can be an
</p>
<p>educational technology (see http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/slide-rule.htm).
</p>
<p>1.1.6 A Brief History of Educational Technology
</p>
<p>Learning is a natural ongoing process that occurs in organized situations as well as
</p>
<p>in everyday activities. As such, the history of learning is coincident with the history
</p>
<p>of human beings. Teaching also has a long history that is roughly coincident with
</p>
<p>the history of human families and tribes. Various tools and techniques have been
</p>
<p>used to support teaching and learning throughout the ages, so one can also conclude
</p>
<p>that educational technology has a very long history (Spector &amp; Ren, 2015). It is
</p>
<p>common to divide human history into broad periods or epochs such as the primitive
</p>
<p>period, the agricultural period, the industrial period, the information age, and the
</p>
<p>emerging era of the intelligent society (see the last chapter in this volume for more
</p>
<p>on this emerging era).
</p>
<p>Early in human history, it is likely that actual objects were used to support
</p>
<p>learning. For example, an elder teaching a young child to hunt might use an actual
</p>
<p>spear to support helping the child learn to aim and throw, perhaps initially at a tree
</p>
<p>rather than at an animal. The abacus was an early calculating device used to keep
</p>
<p>track of inventories, and its use had to be trained as responsibility shifted from one
</p>
<p>person to another.
</p>
<p>For the learner: Compare the abacus (see Fig. 1.1) and the slide rule (see
</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule) with regard to functionality and periods in
</p>
<p>which they were introduced. Reflect on their use and how others were trained to
</p>
<p>make use of them. What is especially noticeably different about using an abacus to
</p>
<p>make a calculation and using the slide rule to make the same calculation?

<p>From very early times, records were kept and histories were recorded on scrolls
</p>
<p>and in pictographs that were used to teach each new generation things that had
</p>
<p>transpired and that might affect their futures. People learned trades on-the-job using
</p>
<p>actual tools for many years; apprenticeship and on-the-job training remain in use in
</p>
<p>many fields.
</p>
<p>The invention of the Gutenberg printing press in the fifteenth century made it
</p>
<p>possible to share information and knowledge with a much wider group of indi-
</p>
<p>viduals than had previously been the case. Its use had become widespread in Europe
</p>
<p>by the sixteenth century, and books became a primary resource used in many
</p>
<p>educational settings. It is worth noting that it took a hundred years or so for the
</p>
<p>printing press technology to be widely adopted. How long did it take smartphones
</p>
<p>to become widely adopted? The printing press transformed learning and instruction
</p>
<p>as well as social, political, and economic arrangements, although it took a couple of
</p>
<p>hundred of years for those transformations to occur. Are similar transformative
</p>
<p>effects likely to occur on account of new and emerging technologies?
</p>
<p>For the instructor: Conduct an in-class or group discussion of the rate of
</p>
<p>adopting a new technology in terms of planning for a new technology and then its
</p>
<p>introduction into a context to the time it takes to make an effective use of that
</p>
<p>technology.
</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, non-text media arrived with the invention of the
</p>
<p>daguerreotype (early camera) in 1839 and wireless transmission of electromagnetic
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 A typical abacus calculating device

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>waves (early radio) and the kinetoscope (moving pictures) in the 1890s (Spector &amp;
</p>
<p>Ren, 2015). The twentieth century is when technologies to support learning, per-
</p>
<p>formance, and instruction rapidly increased, with television and animations in the
</p>
<p>first half of the century and computers and the Internet in the second half of the
</p>
<p>century (see Fig. 1.2).
</p>
<p>What can be concluded based on this brief history? It is obvious that tech-
</p>
<p>nologies change. Technologies are changing at an ever-increasing rate. Will this
</p>
<p>rapid rate of change continue? If so, what are the implications for educational
</p>
<p>technology in the remainder of the twenty-first century?
</p>
<p>Technologies change what people do. Many have said that the printing press
</p>
<p>changed education. Prior to the introduction of printed books, education was limited
</p>
<p>to small groups of specially selected people, and training was conducted in a
</p>
<p>one-to-one or a one-to-a-few setting, typically in the workplace or in the presence of
</p>
<p>a teacher/mentor. Books brought information to the masses and made it possible to
</p>
<p>have larger groups involved in education and to supplement training with materials
</p>
<p>that could be studied outside the workplace. Formal learning became more stan-
</p>
<p>dardized as well as more available. From Plato&rsquo;s Academy established in Athens
</p>
<p>circa 387 BCE with a small number of students to the Martin Luther University of
</p>
<p>Halle-Wittenburg established in 1502, there was a change from a small group of
</p>
<p>students following one teacher&rsquo;s oral teaching to a public institution with students
</p>
<p>following multiple teachers and using standard texts.
</p>
<p>Technologies change what people can do. As new technologies emerged, it
</p>
<p>became possible to represent information and knowledge in many forms, including
</p>
<p>pictures, graphics, animations, and movies. Multiple modes of representation have
</p>
<p>emerged. In addition, multiple forms of communication have also emerged. In
</p>
<p>addition to one-to-one and one-to-many face-to-face communication modalities,
</p>
<p>there are multiple forms of digital communication, including Internet chat rooms,
</p>
<p>videoconferencing, discussion forums, social networks, and more.

<p>For the learner: Make and date an entry in your educational technology journal
</p>
<p>entitled &ldquo;Leading Educational Technologies in Use Today.&rdquo; Then, make a second
</p>
<p>entry entitled &ldquo;Anticipated Educational Technologies of the Future&rdquo; and describe at
</p>
<p>least one of those (read recent Horizon Reports from the New Media Consortium
</p>
<p>located at www.nmc.org).
</p>
<p>Technologies also change what people want to do. As more and more resources
</p>
<p>became available, especially at the end of the twentieth century, many people began
</p>
<p>pursuing areas of personal interest, and there has been a steady growth in informal
</p>
<p>learning as a consequence. Many students now want to experience things in school
</p>
<p>that are relevant to the kinds of jobs and careers they plan to pursue. Students who
</p>
<p>have smartphones and use them outside school want to be able to use them in
</p>
<p>school as well, often to the dismay of teachers and possible disruption of intentional
</p>
<p>learning activities.
</p>
<p>In keeping with the principle that people learn what they do, David Merrill
</p>
<p>(2002, 2007, 2013) has described instructional things that are likely to promote
</p>
<p>desired learning outcomes. Merrill argues that instruction should be centered on
</p>
<p>meaningful and realistic problems, which was probably the case for those being
</p>
<p>trained to use an abacus or slide rule. In addition, the instruction can be described in
</p>
<p>terms of four kinds of things: telling, asking, showing, and doing.
</p>
<p>For the instructor: Conduct an in-class or group discussion relating Merrill&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>first principles of instruction to Gagn&eacute;&rsquo;s (1985) nine events of instruction (see http://
</p>
<p>edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Nine_events_of_instruction). Which of Merrill&rsquo;s princi-
</p>
<p>ples and Gagn&eacute;&rsquo;s events are evident in this chapter?
</p>
<p>In general, there has been a shift in emphasis in formal learning situations to
</p>
<p>include more showing and doing and somewhat less telling as a result of the
</p>
<p>powerful technologies now available. While it seems like the best of times in terms
</p>
<p>of what can be done to use technologies to effectively and efficiently support
</p>
<p>learning, performance, and instruction, it may seem like the worst of times for those
</p>
<p>who are charged with designing, maintaining, and sustaining the technologies used
</p>
<p>to support learning. Instructional designers have many more options in choosing
</p>
<p>resources and support mechanisms than ever before. Establishing what works best
</p>
<p>with whom and in various situations is more difficult than ever before. Cost models
</p>
<p>are dynamic, in part because technologies are now rapidly replaced by newer
</p>
<p>technologies. Training teachers to make effective technologies that change so
</p>
<p>rapidly is an ongoing challenge.
</p>
<p>For the learner: Recall the activity to describe making a calculation with the
</p>
<p>abacus and the same calculation with the slide rule. What difference did you note?
</p>
<p>Someone might argue that to make an effective use of the slide rule, one first needed
</p>
<p>to have an expectation about the range for a reasonable solution since it is very easy
</p>
<p>to misalign the cursor line on the slide rule and make a big mistake as a result. The
</p>
<p>act of reflecting in advance on the problem and a reasonable answer might be
</p>
<p>considered a learning activity or a form of asking oneself. Make an entry in your
</p>
<p>educational technology journal on the learning value of reflecting and instructional
</p>
<p>value of asking as a means to encourage reflection. Provide an example based on
</p>
<p>your own experience.

<p>Edsger Dijkstra in 1972 argued that computers had yet to solve a single problem;
</p>
<p>they had only introduced the new problem of learning to use them effectively. That
</p>
<p>claim seems especially applicable to educational technology in light of the history
</p>
<p>and the recent explosion of new technologies. The reason for including a brief
</p>
<p>history of educational technology is not to highlight how far the discipline has
</p>
<p>come. Rather, it is to remind those entering the discipline and contributing to its
</p>
<p>continued growth and success that:
</p>
<p>&bull; It is seldom the case that there is one right solution or approach to a learning
</p>
<p>problem or situation involving educational technology, especially given the rich
</p>
<p>variety of situations and technologies.
</p>
<p>&bull; What worked for Plato in his academy may not work well in a
</p>
<p>twenty-first-century school; it is clear that what people call the Socratic method
</p>
<p>and then praise did not work out that well for Socrates (Plato&rsquo;s teacher) given
</p>
<p>how the citizens of ancient Athens reacted (for those not familiar with Socrates,
</p>
<p>he was jailed and executed due to his peripatetic teaching; the city leaders
</p>
<p>accused Socrates of corrupting the youth).
</p>
<p>&bull; Planning for the effective and efficient use of educational technologies involves
</p>
<p>planning for the future replacement of a particular technology and the resources,
</p>
<p>processes, and pedagogical approaches associated with that technology.
</p>
<p>&bull; Planning for the future is especially challenging given the rate of change in
</p>
<p>available technologies; however, educational technologists should plan for the
</p>
<p>future and subsequent chapters in this volume will suggest new technologies
</p>
<p>that are emerging and what their impact might be (spoiler alert&mdash;smart learning
</p>
<p>environments and personalized learning may be coming soon to a theater near
</p>
<p>you).
</p>
<p>For the instructor: Direct the class to the UNESCO Web site on education for
</p>
<p>the twenty-first century (see http://en.unesco.org/themes/education-21st-century)
</p>
<p>and discuss the ways, means, and implications of what UNESCO is recommending.
</p>
<p>1.2 The Scope of Educational Technology
</p>
<p>The scope of educational technology is quite large as it involves the application and
</p>
<p>practice of using technologies (in the form of tools, techniques, resources, pro-
</p>
<p>cesses, etc.) to support, facilitate, and enhance learning, performance, and
</p>
<p>instruction. While educational technology has emerged as a recognized discipline
</p>
<p>and profession in the last 50 years, it is a dynamic, complex, and interdisciplinary
</p>
<p>enterprise. It is dynamic in part due to the rapid changes occurring in technology. It
</p>
<p>is complex due to the many interacting factors, components, and people involved in
</p>
<p>an education system or learning environment; moreover, many of the relationships
</p>
<p>among those factors, components, and people are nonlinear and change over time.
</p>
<p>Educational technology is inherently an interdisciplinary enterprise involving,
</p>
<p>14 1 Introduction to Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://en.unesco.org/themes/education-21st-century">http://en.unesco.org/themes/education-21st-century</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>among others, content experts, technical specialists, teachers, and administrators,
</p>
<p>who have different backgrounds and formal training. For an elaboration of a cur-
</p>
<p>riculum for advanced learning technology, see Hartley et al. (2010).
</p>
<p>For the instructor: Before discussing education systems, consider a class dis-
</p>
<p>cussion on the notion of a person as a system&mdash;that is to say, a collection of related
</p>
<p>and interacting components with different kinds of relationships among those
</p>
<p>components. Consider identifying subsystems and discussing one or more of those
</p>
<p>in some detail. If possible, identify delayed effects within the human system as well
</p>
<p>as nonlinear relationships among some of the components.
</p>
<p>One way to elaborate the scope of educational technology is to consider the life
</p>
<p>cycle of a representative education system or learning environment. First, consider
</p>
<p>that you have vacation time coming and you and your family are discussing where
</p>
<p>to go and what to do on the vacation. How might that discussion proceed? You
</p>
<p>might begin with wishes and desires, or you could begin with constraints (time,
</p>
<p>money, distance, etc.). Either way, the discussion has to start somewhere and both
</p>
<p>kinds of considerations are relevant&mdash;desires and constraints. In a sense, both of
</p>
<p>those considerations are likely to narrow the choices. At some point, the discussion
</p>
<p>might involve specific activities or sites or experiences that could become the basis
</p>
<p>for some consensus. Each person involved is voicing a point of view and expressing
</p>
<p>an opinion. In such a situation, it is quite natural to include those involved in the
</p>
<p>discussion to ensure that the vacation will be as successful as possible. Compro-
</p>
<p>mises are likely to occur as the discussion evolves. When a decision is reached, it
</p>
<p>might then be desirable to distribute the various tasks associated with implementing
</p>
<p>the decision (e.g., making reservations, collecting and packing appropriate clothes,
</p>
<p>notifying friends). Keep vacation planning in mind as a model as the much more
</p>
<p>complex enterprise of educational technology planning is elaborated.
</p>
<p>For the sake of this discussion, let us suppose that a new course has been
</p>
<p>mandated for all high school students&mdash;namely formal and informal logic. There is
</p>
<p>no requirement to have any knowledge about the subject of logic to follow this
</p>
<p>discussion. Indeed, an educational technologist recruited to support the effort might
</p>
<p>well have no subject matter knowledge at all. How might the process evolve? The
</p>
<p>sections that follow indicate some of the concerns, questions, activities, and pro-
</p>
<p>cesses that might be part and parcel of the life-cycle planning and support of this
</p>
<p>course from the perspective of educational technology. It is worth noting [and
</p>
<p>probably worth discussing/challenging in class] that some form of technology is
</p>
<p>involved in nearly every course, so this discussion naturally involves educational
</p>
<p>technology. The perspective represented below is not necessarily what is typical
</p>
<p>when a new course is being planned. In many cases, the content expert or teacher is
</p>
<p>the primary person leading the way. However, the more that technology is critical
</p>
<p>for the effort and the larger the scale of the effort, the more important it is that
</p>
<p>educational technologists and instructional designers play leading roles.
</p>
<p>1.2 The Scope of Educational Technology 15</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2.1 Needs Assessment
</p>
<p>How to begin planning support for a new course in formal and informal logic for
</p>
<p>high school students? Let us suppose that you, the educational technologist in the
</p>
<p>role of instructional designer, are at the initial planning meeting for this effort, along
</p>
<p>with a logic teacher, a school administrator, and a system specialist. The admin-
</p>
<p>istrator begins by stating the mandate&mdash;namely, create a new course on formal and
</p>
<p>informal logic and implement it using the school&rsquo;s learning management system,
</p>
<p>since the course will be conducted entirely online anytime in the student&rsquo;s last two
</p>
<p>years, at the students&rsquo; pace, and required for graduation.
</p>
<p>The logic teacher is excited that the subject is receiving such special treatment.
</p>
<p>You are concerned, however, about the rationale and motivation for the course. You
</p>
<p>ask, &ldquo;Who decided that this should be done? How was the need determined? What
</p>
<p>problem are we trying to solve?&rdquo; The administrator is prepared and offers the results
</p>
<p>of a study of graduates and their successes and failures over a five-year period. The
</p>
<p>administrator called this an exploratory effort to find out how well graduates were
</p>
<p>doing. As it happened, the study showed that of the 73% of graduates who went
</p>
<p>directly to college, 57% of them dropped out during the first two years. Surveys
</p>
<p>suggested that most of those who dropped out felt unprepared for the rigors of
</p>
<p>college. Follow-up interviews suggested that the lack of preparation involved the
</p>
<p>challenges of thinking critically and logically required in many of the college
</p>
<p>courses. You respond by saying that it was wise to conduct that study, which is one
</p>
<p>kind of needs assessment. The study in effect identifies a gap in high school
</p>
<p>education. Those in the room readily agree that this gap exists and that it should be
</p>
<p>addressed.
</p>
<p>This example shows a progression from a symptom (high school students
</p>
<p>entering college drop out at a high rate) to a problem (a gap in preparing high
</p>
<p>school students to think critically and logically) to a need (address that gap with a
</p>
<p>new course aimed at developing general reasoning skills). A needs assessment is a
</p>
<p>way to identify symptoms and likely underlying causes resulting in a clear and
</p>
<p>coherent statement of the problem to be addressed. It is important to spend time and
</p>
<p>effort in determining the problem and associated need to avoid unnecessary rework
</p>
<p>or solving the wrong problem. The remaining life-cycle aspects will be addressed in
</p>
<p>turn, as this discussion is intended to be introductory and notional. Special
</p>
<p>emphasis has been placed on needs assessment as that is a critical first step.
</p>
<p>1.2.2 Requirements and Feasibility Analysis
</p>
<p>Once the problem and need have been identified, the goal or goals of the effort can
</p>
<p>be identified. These goals also form the basis for determining the degree to which
</p>
<p>the effort is succeeding once a solution is developed and deployed. It is now
</p>
<p>possible to begin considering solution approaches and a solution. This can and
</p>
<p>should be done with the desired goals in mind, as that is how the solution will be
</p>
<p>16 1 Introduction to Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>evaluated and success determined. A requirement analysis creates a framework for a
</p>
<p>solution approach.
</p>
<p>In this case, it was determined that there was no room in the daily schedule of
</p>
<p>courses conducted in the school setting for a new course. The school happened to
</p>
<p>have an online learning management system, and the system administrator indicated
</p>
<p>that it could be used to host a new course. The logic teacher indicated that the
</p>
<p>content could be delivered online, including practice with feedback, although the
</p>
<p>formal tests should take place in a monitored situation at the school. Two tests were
</p>
<p>proposed, one for the first half of the course on formal logic and a second one for
</p>
<p>the second half of the course on informal logic. Both tests had to be passed in order
</p>
<p>to pass the course. Passing would involve a grade of 80% or better on each test,
</p>
<p>with possibilities for remediation and retesting.
</p>
<p>It seems that many decisions had already been made prior to bringing the
</p>
<p>educational technologist on board. This is not so unusual and has led one of the
</p>
<p>authors to specify the Universal Underlying Principal of all Systems (including
</p>
<p>education systems; UUPS&mdash;pronounced &ldquo;oops&rdquo;): Something has already gone
</p>
<p>wrong. When a project begins and the educational technologist joins the effort, it is
</p>
<p>not uncommon for the educational technologist to believe that a bad decision has
</p>
<p>already been made. Sometimes, it is due to the lack of a needs assessment (not so in
</p>
<p>this case). In other cases, it is due to a particular solution or solution approach being
</p>
<p>mandated that is not necessarily an optimal way to address the problem. Perhaps
</p>
<p>having a self-paced online course with automated feedback on progress and little or
</p>
<p>no collaboration is not what you believe best in this case, so you raise the question
</p>
<p>&mdash;why that particular approach while recognizing the need to offer the course
</p>
<p>online and outside the normal day-to-day schedule? The administrator then
</p>
<p>responds that doing it as a self-paced online course with automated feedback will
</p>
<p>allow it to be offered to other students not at this school who sign up at a cost.
</p>
<p>Doing it that way can generate revenue for the school.
</p>
<p>You then note that this was not part of the identified need or problem being
</p>
<p>addressed. In a way, this is what planners and implementers call mission creep&mdash;
</p>
<p>expanding the scope of the effort as it evolves. The first corollary to UUPS is that
</p>
<p>mistakes and oversights rarely occur alone; one often leads to another. You point
</p>
<p>this out to the administrator and say that there then needs to be added a second
</p>
<p>need&mdash;generating revenue&mdash;along with a second goal and outcome measure.
</p>
<p>When asked if you can design and develop such a course in collaboration with
</p>
<p>the content expert, you say you believe so, but you will need to learn more from the
</p>
<p>content expert and the system administrator. That follow-on deliberation can be
</p>
<p>considered an early feasibility review of the requirements now in place. Once a
</p>
<p>simple prototype is constructed early in the design process (Rossett, 2009), a more
</p>
<p>robust feasibility study can be conducted to confirm that what has been planned can
</p>
<p>indeed be accomplished.
</p>
<p>For the learner: Three corollaries to UUPS have been identified: (1) Mistakes
</p>
<p>rarely occur in isolation; one tends to lead to another; (2) resources are nearly
</p>
<p>always inadequate to do what you believe should be done; (3) others generally have
</p>
<p>1.2 The Scope of Educational Technology 17</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>good ideas. Were any of these corollaries evident in the example of creating a new
</p>
<p>online logic course? If so, describe how. If not, indicate how they might have been
</p>
<p>brought into that discussion.
</p>
<p>1.2.3 Design/Redesign
</p>
<p>Designing and planning learning activities, selecting and sequencing resources,
</p>
<p>creating units of instruction, and determining formative and summative assessments
</p>
<p>are typical tasks to be accomplished as a course is being designed. The big three
</p>
<p>issues for those planning and implementing courses are: (a) What to teach (content
</p>
<p>to be learned), (b) how to teach (strategies and activities to promote understanding
</p>
<p>and mastery), and (c) how to identify things to do differently (evaluation of the
</p>
<p>course with the potential to improve subsequent versions).
</p>
<p>To guide these activities, it is useful to have an overall approach in mind along
</p>
<p>with associated instructional strategies. At this stage, very close collaboration with
</p>
<p>the context expert is required. While the content expert is likely to understand what
</p>
<p>is to be learned very well, it is not as likely that a content expert will understand
</p>
<p>how best to promote the desired learning. Determining the assumptions being made
</p>
<p>by the content expert is important as some of those assumptions might require
</p>
<p>confirmation or turn out be without foundation. Moreover, a content expert will
</p>
<p>often have a desire to do much more than can be realistically accomplished and may
</p>
<p>well have a different goal in mind than the one established at the beginning. For
</p>
<p>example, a content expert may unwittingly want students to become dedicated
</p>
<p>scholars in that subject area, which was not the original goal. Keeping focused on
</p>
<p>the goal and desired outcomes is an ongoing challenge. A creative educational
</p>
<p>technologist can elicit from content expert ideas about innovative activities and
</p>
<p>learning experiences tightly connected with the specific goals of the effort.
</p>
<p>Content experts have a tendency to include the full breadth and depth of their
</p>
<p>knowledge, while an educational technologist or instructional designer is generally
</p>
<p>trained to stay close to activities, content, and resources directly aligned with
</p>
<p>desired learning outcomes. Awareness of these different perspectives is important.
</p>
<p>The attitude of a content expert might be expressed in this way: &ldquo;I want my students
</p>
<p>to love this subject area just like I do.&rdquo; On the other hand, the attitude of the
</p>
<p>educational technologist might be expressed as follows: &ldquo;I want students to succeed
</p>
<p>in attaining the targeted learning outcomes.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>There are many approaches that can be used in a course. In the logic course case,
</p>
<p>the overall approach has been partially predetermined&mdash;namely a self-paced online
</p>
<p>approach with primary interactions taking place between an individual learner and
</p>
<p>the learning system. Within that general approach, there are opportunities for a
</p>
<p>variety of instructional strategies, ranging from a didactic and expository strategy
</p>
<p>(present content, provide practice cases with feedback, quiz, etc.) to a
</p>
<p>problem-based strategy (start with problems and have the learner explored the
</p>
<p>resources to find a solution). There are also variations of how much learner control
</p>
<p>to include and when it is desirable to include learner control of such things as
</p>
<p>18 1 Introduction to Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>problems, topics, resources, and so on. Finding an approach that best fits a situation
</p>
<p>is a typical challenge for an educational technologist.
</p>
<p>Many important decisions occur during the planning or design phase, and it is
</p>
<p>desirable to see what others think about those decisions. Another corollary to UUPS
</p>
<p>is this: Others frequently have good ideas. In this case, a second content expert
</p>
<p>might be invited to offer a perspective and students who have had a similar course
</p>
<p>could be invited to offer a student perspective. Since the course is being designed to
</p>
<p>help high school graduates succeed in their first few years at college, it might also
</p>
<p>be good to involve college instructors who have lots of students dropping out due to
</p>
<p>poor reasoning capability. Because part of the design process involves selecting
</p>
<p>resources and activities, prior to fully developing those resources and activities it
</p>
<p>might also be wise to have input with regard to the meaningfulness and appro-
</p>
<p>priateness of those things. Finally, part of the design process involves specifying
</p>
<p>how the user interface will work, so having input on the interface in terms of
</p>
<p>usability and learnability prior to committing resources to development is also a
</p>
<p>good idea.
</p>
<p>During the design phase of an effort, or sometimes earlier, it is generally a good
</p>
<p>idea to create an implementation plan to guide development and deployment and an
</p>
<p>evaluation plan that includes both formative and summative evaluations. Many
</p>
<p>funded efforts require that such plans are submitted with a project proposal.
</p>
<p>1.2.4 Development
</p>
<p>Once a design has been specified, it is possible to begin developing and imple-
</p>
<p>menting the course. The implementation plan can guide this process. This devel-
</p>
<p>opment process is likely to involve the content expert and a number of specialists
</p>
<p>(e.g., a media specialist, a programmer, and a system specialist). By this point in the
</p>
<p>development of the course, a number of constraints probably had to be addressed
</p>
<p>and compromises made, which should be documented. Another UUPS corollary is
</p>
<p>that resources are seldom adequate to do what you and team believe should be
</p>
<p>done. Compromises are often necessary. However, what should rarely be com-
</p>
<p>promised is the intended goal of the effort.
</p>
<p>Since a number of highly trained people are involved, it is again wise to proceed
</p>
<p>in steps, beginning with a working prototype that includes parts of all major
</p>
<p>components including the interface. Once such a working prototype has been
</p>
<p>developed, it can be tested internally, just as the design was tested one or more
</p>
<p>times before being passed on to development. This iterative process of design and
</p>
<p>development is sometimes referred to as design research (Reeves, 2006). This
</p>
<p>iterative process of refinement can continue into the deployment phase as data on
</p>
<p>use by students become available.
</p>
<p>A point worth emphasizing is that each of these activities is seldom a
</p>
<p>one-time-and-done kind of thing. It may happen in the evolution of the logic course
</p>
<p>that the automated feedback mechanisms are not working as they should, or perhaps
</p>
<p>the system is losing track of learner progress through the various modules. Any
</p>
<p>1.2 The Scope of Educational Technology 19</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>number of problems with the implementation can be discovered and addressed
</p>
<p>during development. A variety of educational technologists are likely to be
</p>
<p>involved during development (see the roles of educational technologists below).
</p>
<p>Coordinating their various efforts is a challenging task and one that best resides
</p>
<p>with the lead educational technologist or instructional designer (not the content
</p>
<p>expert nor the system administrator).
</p>
<p>1.2.5 Deployment
</p>
<p>Prior to full-scale deployment on a school-wide or larger basis, it is generally wise
</p>
<p>to try out the course with a small but representative group of students, including
</p>
<p>both high-performing students and those who are not doing as well. It is likely that
</p>
<p>such a trial field test will result in a need to make changes in the design and/or the
</p>
<p>development of the course. Again, this is a step in a design research approach and it
</p>
<p>should be well documented, as should each step in this evolving process.
</p>
<p>Finally, the course goes live. Is the work of educational technology now done in
</p>
<p>this case? If you said yes, do not pass, go, or leave the room&mdash;there is much more
</p>
<p>work yet to be done.
</p>
<p>For the learner: What else do you think needs to be done for the newly created
</p>
<p>logic course to be considered a success?
</p>
<p>1.2.6 Management
</p>
<p>It is likely that the emphasis will shift from the educational technologist to the
</p>
<p>system administrator and the content expert who will monitor progress and report
</p>
<p>problems back to the educational technology team should they occur. Plans should
</p>
<p>be made to (a) monitor student progress, (b) gather and report student performance
</p>
<p>outcomes, perceptions, and reaction, and (c) track students subsequent to gradua-
</p>
<p>tion. In some cases, it is required to have a management plan in place; for
</p>
<p>large-scale efforts, such a plan is advisable even if it is not required.
</p>
<p>1.2.7 Evaluation
</p>
<p>Once the course is deployed, the natural question to address is whether or not it is
</p>
<p>achieving its intended goals. To what extent are goals being met? That question is
</p>
<p>what drives a summative evaluation of the effort&mdash;or periodic summative evalua-
</p>
<p>tions of the effort. It was mentioned earlier that documenting the effort as it was
</p>
<p>being designed, developed, and deployed was important. That documentation and
</p>
<p>associated observations and interviews with key persons as the effort evolves
</p>
<p>constitute what can be considered a formative evaluation of the effort, again con-
</p>
<p>sistent with a design research approach. It is often difficult to interpret the findings
</p>
<p>of an impact study or summative evaluation without the results of a formative

<p>evaluation. An evaluation plan typically includes a formative evaluation plan (e.g.,
</p>
<p>a fidelity of implementation study that typically documents progress and includes
</p>
<p>interviews and observations) and a summative evaluation plan (e.g., an impact
</p>
<p>study). As mentioned previously, an evaluation plan is often developed early in the
</p>
<p>effort. In this case with the online logic course aimed at improving reasoning skills
</p>
<p>to help high school graduates succeed in college, the impact study needs to involve
</p>
<p>graduates several years after they have completed the new course.
</p>
<p>1.2.8 Support
</p>
<p>Support for an educational technology effort runs throughout the process. Deter-
</p>
<p>mining support requirements and needs occurs early in the process. Identifying key
</p>
<p>personnel and training them begin early and continue throughout design, devel-
</p>
<p>opment, and deployment. Educational technologists as well as system specialists,
</p>
<p>programmers, and various staff are likely to be involved in providing support for the
</p>
<p>online logic course. Students need to know whom to call when they encounter
</p>
<p>problems. In this case, if the problem involves logic and solving problems, then a
</p>
<p>tutor might need to be identified and trained.
</p>
<p>1.2.9 Training
</p>
<p>As previously suggested, identifying training needs and then helping prepare and
</p>
<p>implement training materials and sessions are important in ensuring the success of
</p>
<p>an innovative educational technology project. Tutors and staff support personnel
</p>
<p>obviously need to be trained in order to properly support the new course. Moreover,
</p>
<p>training students in the first week or so of the course might be required in order to
</p>
<p>ensure that students know what is expected and can perform all of the necessary
</p>
<p>actions and activities required in the course. Many innovative educational tech-
</p>
<p>nology projects fail due to poor communication and inadequate preparation and
</p>
<p>training of key personnel (Rogers, 2003).
</p>
<p>1.3 Dimensions of Educational Technology
</p>
<p>Not only is educational technology a multi-disciplinary enterprise but is also
</p>
<p>multifaceted, having a number of dimensions to take into consideration in light of
</p>
<p>the processes discussed above and the roles to be discussed below. One of the
</p>
<p>things that makes educational technology such an interesting profession is the
</p>
<p>diversity of people, problems, needs, technologies, and solutions that are involved.
</p>
<p>If one thrives on challenges and complexity, then educational technology is well
</p>
<p>worth pursuing.
</p>
<p>1.2 The Scope of Educational Technology 21</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Hartley and colleagues (2010) conducted a three-year study aimed at developing
</p>
<p>a curriculum for advanced learning technology. Among the dimensions of practice
</p>
<p>and scholarship relevant to the field, they cited the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Computer and software architecture and engineering
</p>
<p>&bull; Design research
</p>
<p>&bull; Human&ndash;computer interaction
</p>
<p>&bull; Learning psychology
</p>
<p>&bull; Program evaluation
</p>
<p>&bull; Project management
</p>
<p>&bull; Social interactions
</p>
<p>&bull; System thinking.
</p>
<p>Another way of conceptualizing the dimensions of this complex and
</p>
<p>multi-disciplinary discipline is in terms of the activities, processes, and things with
</p>
<p>which educational technologists are commonly involved, as in the following brief
</p>
<p>overview.
</p>
<p>1.3.1 Communication/Coordination
</p>
<p>When conducting the research to establish competencies for professionals involved
</p>
<p>in various aspects of educational technology, the International Board of Standards
</p>
<p>for Training, Performance and Instruction (ibstpi) found that the most critical skill
</p>
<p>area was communication (see the various standards located at http://ibstpi.org/).
</p>
<p>Communication competency includes oral, written, and aural skills as well as the
</p>
<p>ability to make an effective use of various communication modalities and repre-
</p>
<p>sentation forms. Along with effective communication skills are associated coordi-
</p>
<p>nation skills (e.g., collaborating, compromising, managing, leading). Unfortunately,
</p>
<p>very little effort is placed on developing communication and coordination skills in
</p>
<p>many academic programs where the emphasis tends to be on mastering the subject
</p>
<p>matter. We consider it a myth that people are born with a golden tongue or gift of
</p>
<p>gab or leadership skills. Those skills can be trained and developed and are among
</p>
<p>the competences recommended by Hartley et al. (2010) for those being trained as
</p>
<p>advanced learning technologists.
</p>
<p>1.3.2 Content/Resources
</p>
<p>With the advent of the Internet, the resources that educational technologists and
</p>
<p>content experts can access for inclusion in a learning environment are enormous.
</p>
<p>One way to capture the complexity of this dimension is in terms of a hierarchy that
</p>
<p>begins with information resources at the base of a pyramid (see Fig. 1.3). Infor-
</p>
<p>mation that has been determined to be reliable and accurate can be considered
</p>
<p>knowledge and a candidate for inclusion among learning resources. When that
</p>
<p>22 1 Introduction to Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://ibstpi.org/">http://ibstpi.org/</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>knowledge is linked to a learning goal or objective, it can be considered a learning
</p>
<p>resource. When activities, feedback, and assessment are included with a learning
</p>
<p>resource, it becomes an instructional object or resource.
</p>
<p>1.3.3 Hardware Devices and Software
</p>
<p>In addition to having to deal with so many learning resources, educational tech-
</p>
<p>nologists have to be familiar with, understand, and/or manage a wide variety of
</p>
<p>devices and associated software. If one focuses only on a computer to be used as the
</p>
<p>primary delivery or support device, then there are still many things to take into
</p>
<p>account, including a variety of workstations, personal computers, tablet computers,
</p>
<p>handheld computers, and so on with various operating systems, software, network
</p>
<p>configurations, cloud-based systems, and more. One might say that the price of
</p>
<p>competence as an educational technologist is nearly constant professional devel-
</p>
<p>opment. Openness to new possibilities created by the affordances of new and
</p>
<p>emerging technologies is required for an educational technologist to maintain
</p>
<p>currency and relevance as a professional practitioner.
</p>
<p>1.3.4 Implementation
</p>
<p>Educational technologists not only need to know about and understand how people
</p>
<p>learn and the resources and devices that can support learning, they need to know
</p>
<p>how to do a variety of things to make support for learning real and effective
</p>
<p>(Hartley et al., 2010). In some cases, this may take the form of transferring a reliable
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.3 A hierarchy of resources. Adapted from Spector (2015)
</p>
<p>1.3 Dimensions of Educational Technology 23</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>text-based resource into a visual form. In other cases, it may require the inclusion of
</p>
<p>support for discussion forums and chat rooms. In still other cases, support may
</p>
<p>require the collection and analysis of learner actions and inputs. In a general way,
</p>
<p>educational technologists need to understand what teachers, students, and support
</p>
<p>personnel do in order to provide appropriate tools and technologies to help make
</p>
<p>them more effective and productive in their various activities. An interesting
</p>
<p>in-class or online activity or discussion could involve a response to these questions:
</p>
<p>(a) What kinds of learning experiences exist? (b) Who are involved in supporting
</p>
<p>learning? (c) What kinds of things can be done using technology to support all those
</p>
<p>involved in learning, performance, and instructional activities?
</p>
<p>1.3.5 Media and Representation Formats
</p>
<p>Along with the explosion of resources available on the Internet have come a wide
</p>
<p>variety of representation formats. As the educational technology timeline suggests,
</p>
<p>text, pictures, audio, and video occurred were dominant in the nineteenth century
</p>
<p>and first half of the twentieth century. Within each of those media categories, there
</p>
<p>were a variety of types, such as black and white photographs, graphs along with
</p>
<p>text, and so on. With the advent of computing and the Internet, the ways and means
</p>
<p>of representing knowledge resources grew dramatically. Perhaps, a dramatic way to
</p>
<p>represent the rich variety of representation formats is with the painted scroll from
</p>
<p>the Song dynasty called &ldquo;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&rdquo; attributed
</p>
<p>to Zhang Zeduan circa 1100 CE (see The China Online Museum located at http://
</p>
<p>www.comuseum.com/painting/famous-chinese-paintings/along-the-river-during-the-
</p>
<p>qingming-festival/). The Web site shows a progression of replicas of the original
</p>
<p>scroll that was more than 5 m in length, culminating with an electronic animated 3D
</p>
<p>version that is more than 150 m in length and put on display in 2010 at the
</p>
<p>Shanghai Expo.
</p>
<p>1.4 Educational Technology Perspectives
</p>
<p>As previously referenced, the work by Hartley and colleagues (2010) on developing
</p>
<p>a curriculum for the broad domain of advanced learning technologies resulted in
</p>
<p>important foundation work pertaining to understanding the knowledge, skills, and
</p>
<p>competencies required of educational technologies. Their work involved numerous
</p>
<p>surveys of professionals and academics, a detailed review of the research and
</p>
<p>practice literature, interviews, and focus group discussions over a three-year period.
</p>
<p>Because the goal was to create a curriculum framework, it was deemed appropriate
</p>
<p>to adopt a competency framework. As results were compiled, five clusters of related
</p>
<p>competencies emerged:
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1. Knowledge competence domain&mdash;as should be obvious at this point in the
</p>
<p>discussion, an educational technologist has to have well-developed knowledge
</p>
<p>in a number of areas, including learning psychology, human&ndash;computer inter-
</p>
<p>action, social psychology, instructional design, software engineering, technol-
</p>
<p>ogy integration, and so on.
</p>
<p>2. Process competence domain&mdash;understanding what is possible with regard to a
</p>
<p>variety of devices and software is critical for an educational technologist; main-
</p>
<p>taining an up-to-date understanding ofwhat can and cannot be done and atwhat cost
</p>
<p>and with which expertise is expected of an educational technology professional.
</p>
<p>3. Application competence domain&mdash;educational technologists are often respon-
</p>
<p>sible for making things happen, such as taking the specification for a learning
</p>
<p>environment or course and translating that specification into a reality; that ability
</p>
<p>requires competence in a number of application areas, including the creation of
</p>
<p>media resources and assessment mechanisms.
</p>
<p>4. Personal and social competence domain&mdash;the work of educational technologists
</p>
<p>offers within the context of a team involving persons with different backgrounds
</p>
<p>and expertise; as previously indicated, effective communication, collaboration,
</p>
<p>and coordination skills are critical for success as a professional practitioner.
</p>
<p>5. Innovation and creativity competence domain&mdash;new technologies and approa-
</p>
<p>ches to learning create a need for professionals to be flexible and creative in
</p>
<p>making use of appropriate resources and technologies to achieve desired out-
</p>
<p>comes; this often involves significant changes in learning activities, teaching
</p>
<p>methods, and instructional designs.
</p>
<p>1.5 Emerging Technologies and Changing Contexts
</p>
<p>One of the basic beliefs guiding this volume involves change. Learning is char-
</p>
<p>acterized by stable and persisting changes in what a person or group of people know
</p>
<p>and can do. Monitoring changes and progress of learning is among the things that
</p>
<p>educational technologists need to understand, as do teachers and learners. Tech-
</p>
<p>nologies change, as indicated in the earlier discussion of the history of educational
</p>
<p>technology. Changes in technologies are occurring at an increasing rate, as noted
</p>
<p>previously. In addition, there are changes in how formal learning is conceptualized
</p>
<p>and organized. The world of the educational technologist is dominated by change,
</p>
<p>and the various things that change have an effect on each other. A new technology
</p>
<p>can introduce a new approach to teaching. Subsequent chapters in this volume will
</p>
<p>revisit the impact of these changes on learning, performance, and instruction. An
</p>
<p>excellent source for information about emerging technologies and their likely
</p>
<p>impact on learning and instruction is the New Media Consortium (see http://www.
</p>
<p>nmc.org/) and their annual Horizon Reports in a variety of locations and contexts.
</p>
<p>As an advance organizer for subsequent chapters, a few remarks on emerging
</p>
<p>technologies and changing contexts follow.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.5.1 Emerging Technologies
</p>
<p>What are some of the emerging technologies? In the category of devices and
</p>
<p>hardware, 3D printers and wearable computing devices come to mind.
</p>
<p>Three-dimensional printers are already having an impact associated with a move-
</p>
<p>ment called makerspace (see, e.g., http://library-maker-culture.weebly.com/what-
</p>
<p>are-they.html), in which learners engage in using a 3D printer to create and test an
</p>
<p>object or artifact in the context of learning by doing and design-based learning.
</p>
<p>Wearable devices such as smartwatches and Internet-enabled head-mounted dis-
</p>
<p>plays exist and will surely find their way into a variety of learning and instructional
</p>
<p>situations.
</p>
<p>In the category of processes and applications of advanced technologies, learning
</p>
<p>analytics, adaptive instructional systems, and personalized learning are being tested
</p>
<p>in small-scale situations as extensions of earlier intelligent tutoring systems that can
</p>
<p>take into account a robust and dynamic representation of the learner in terms of
</p>
<p>prior knowledge and performance, interests, motivation, preferences, and even
</p>
<p>moods. Game-based learning, gamification, and augmented and virtual realities are
</p>
<p>among the emerging technologies that are gradually finding their way into learning
</p>
<p>and instructional situations. It is nearly impossible to envision all of the possible
</p>
<p>technologies likely to emerge in the next 10 years. What is certain is that there will
</p>
<p>be many and the challenge of being a competent educational technologist will
</p>
<p>increase, along with the need for increasing refined areas of specialization and
</p>
<p>expertise.
</p>
<p>1.5.2 Changing Contexts
</p>
<p>What is the likely impact of new and emerging technologies on learning and
</p>
<p>instructional contexts? Some envision a world in which everyone has access to the
</p>
<p>collected knowledge and wisdom of humanity along with automated learning and
</p>
<p>instructional devices and mechanisms; some even predict the disappearance of
</p>
<p>schools and teachers in such a world. We do not share that particular vision of the
</p>
<p>future, although we clearly acknowledge that formal learning environments are
</p>
<p>changing along with increased informal learning resources and environments. An
</p>
<p>obvious change in formal contexts involves the rapid growth of online learning.
</p>
<p>Hybrid learning environments that integrated online resources and activities with
</p>
<p>face-to-face contexts are now the norm in many higher educational institutions as
</p>
<p>well as in some K-12 schools. Because there are so many Internet resources
</p>
<p>available to so many people, often at no cost, many teachers are now adopting the
</p>
<p>practice of flipping the classroom. This involves assigning readings and associated
</p>
<p>discussions outside of class, sometimes within an Internet-based environment, and
</p>
<p>using class time to have students practice applying knowledge learned outside class
</p>
<p>on problems, sometimes working in small groups. This allows the teacher to shift
</p>
<p>the role from primary presenter of information to that of providing constructive and
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>meaningful feedback to develop learner competence and enhance the application
</p>
<p>and transfer of knowledge to solving meaningful problems.
</p>
<p>Other changes are occurring as well. Whereas literacy used to focus on reading,
</p>
<p>writing, and basic arithmetic, the concept of literacy has expanded considerably to
</p>
<p>include digital literacy, which includes multiple literacies (e.g., information literacy,
</p>
<p>technology literacy, visualization literacy). This means that the notion of basic skills
</p>
<p>typically taught in primary and secondary school settings has been enlarged, and
</p>
<p>supporting the development of digital literacy skills using technology is one
</p>
<p>obvious approach.
</p>
<p>Pedagogical approaches are also changing. Since the introduction of interactive
</p>
<p>simulations in the last part of the previous century, there has been a growing
</p>
<p>emphasis on learning by doing, sometimes also referred to as authentic or situated
</p>
<p>learning. Augmented and virtual realities and immersive environments have sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly enhanced the power of interactive simulations. As a result, such appli-
</p>
<p>cations are expected to continue to change and influence how knowledge and
</p>
<p>expertise are developed.
</p>
<p>1.6 Roles of Educational Technologists
</p>
<p>Those trained in the area of educational technology end up in various professional
</p>
<p>positions with a variety of responsibilities. What follows is a brief review of the job
</p>
<p>titles, roles, and responsibilities associated with educational technology profes-
</p>
<p>sionals; it is not intended to be a complete or comprehensive of the various roles in
</p>
<p>which educational technologists are placed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Instructional designer&mdash;responsible for planning, analyzing, designing, devel-
</p>
<p>oping, modifying, implementing, evaluating, and/or managing a variety of
</p>
<p>courses, instructional systems, and learning environments
</p>
<p>&bull; Instructional project manager&mdash;responsible for leading instructional develop-
</p>
<p>ment projects, directing educational programs, and/or managing the creation of
</p>
<p>learning environment efforts
</p>
<p>&bull; Media specialist&mdash;responsible for creating, finding, modifying, and/or using a
</p>
<p>variety of media artifacts in various formats
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology coordinator&mdash;responsible for helping teachers and instructors find,
</p>
<p>modify, use, and/or integrate a variety of educational technology resources
</p>
<p>&bull; System administrator&mdash;responsible for managing and supporting an education
</p>
<p>system, content management system, learning management system, and/or a
</p>
<p>network environment used to support learning and instruction
</p>
<p>&bull; Developer/programmer&mdash;responsible for coding instructionally related software
</p>
<p>and/or developing mediated objects and resources to be used in support of
</p>
<p>learning and instruction
</p>
<p>1.5 Emerging Technologies and Changing Contexts 27</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Evaluator&mdash;responsible for the formative and summative evaluation of lessons,
</p>
<p>courses, programs, instructional systems, and/or learning environments
</p>
<p>&bull; Instructor&mdash;responsible leading units of instruction, tutoring students, and/or
</p>
<p>providing learning guidance and feedback in the context of formal learning
</p>
<p>contexts.
</p>
<p>Another way to represent the complexity of educational technology is in terms of
</p>
<p>Robert Tennyson&rsquo;s (1995) Fourth-Generation Instructional Systems Development
</p>
<p>(ISD) model (see Fig. 1.4). Note that in this context, the notion of &ldquo;development&rdquo;
</p>
<p>covers the entire life cycle of planning, implementing, managing, and evaluating an
</p>
<p>educational effort. Some practitioners refer to this notion of development as big D,
</p>
<p>and some also use design in the same big D sense to cover the entire life cycle. In
</p>
<p>this volume, we generally use design and development to refer to specific tasks
</p>
<p>rather than the entire process.
</p>
<p>Terminology is often an important component of gaining competence in a
</p>
<p>particular domain. For that reason, we have included definitions of key terms in
</p>
<p>each chapter in an effort to use those terms as would most educational technologists.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, different uses do occur in various situations. That is particularly true
</p>
<p>with regard to terms &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; and &ldquo;evaluation&rdquo; which are treated later in this
</p>
<p>volume. In general, and by way of an advance organizer, &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; is most often
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.4 Tennyson&rsquo;s Fourth-Generation ISD model (used with permission)
</p>
<p>28 1 Introduction to Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>used to refer to individuals&mdash;learners or workers. &ldquo;Evaluation&rdquo; on the other hand is
</p>
<p>most often used to refer to courses, projects, programs, products, policies, pro-
</p>
<p>cesses, or practices. There are two things especially noteworthy in Tennyson&rsquo;s ISD
</p>
<p>model. First, a situational evaluation applies regardless of where in that model one
</p>
<p>happens to be working. Second, the model is elaborate primarily in terms of what
</p>
<p>people do. As a consequence, that model can serve as a point of departure for
</p>
<p>elaborating in more detail the roles of an instructional designer, which are differ-
</p>
<p>ently defined than those of an educational technologist.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) AECT definition of educational technology is the study and ethical practice of
</p>
<p>facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using, and
</p>
<p>managing appropriate technological processes and resources.
</p>
<p>(2) The scope of educational technology includes needs assessment, requirements
</p>
<p>and feasibility analysis, design/redesign, development, deployment, manage-
</p>
<p>ment, evaluation, support, training.
</p>
<p>(3) The dimensions of educational technology include communication/coordination,
</p>
<p>content/resources, hardware devices and software, implementation, media, and
</p>
<p>representation formats.
</p>
<p>(4) Roles of educational technologist include instructional designer, instructional
</p>
<p>project manager, media specialist, technology coordinator, system administra-
</p>
<p>tor, developer/programmer, evaluator, and instructor.

<p>2.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Learning is a process that brings together personal and environmental experiences
</p>
<p>and influences for acquiring, enriching or modifying one&rsquo;s knowledge, skills,
</p>
<p>values, attitudes, behaviors, and worldviews. Learning theories develop hypotheses
</p>
<p>that describe how this process takes place. The scientific study of learning started in
</p>
<p>earnest at the dawn of the twentieth century. Behaviorism, cognitivism,
</p>
<p>socio-constructivism, and other views have been proposed as the emphasis has been
</p>
<p>placed on cognitive style and emerging educational technologies. These theories
</p>
<p>will be discussed in subsequent sections.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, firstly the definition of learning in the context of technologies
</p>
<p>will be described. Then, learning theories, including behaviorism, cognitivism,
</p>
<p>constructivism, and other views, will be discussed. Finally, technology-enhanced
</p>
<p>learning will be described briefly and elaborated in subsequent chapters.
</p>
<p>2.2 Learning Theories
</p>
<p>Learning happens everywhere and everyday for everybody, but what is learning?
</p>
<p>Most people have the intuition that learning implies the ability to do something that
</p>
<p>the learner could not do before or know something that the learner did not know
</p>
<p>before.
</p>
<p>In most psychological theories, learning is defined as a persistent change in
</p>
<p>human performance or performance potential (Lohr &amp; Chang, 2005). According to
</p>
<p>Spector (2016), the changes could include one&rsquo;s abilities, attitudes, beliefs,
</p>
<p>knowledge, and skills. However, the major concepts and principles of learning vary
</p>
<p>with learning theories in different ages. Learning theories are conceptual frame-
</p>
<p>works describing how knowledge is absorbed, processed, and retained during
</p>
<p>learning (Simandan, 2013). In the process of designing and developing instructional
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>systems, learning environments and learning activities relevant learning theories
</p>
<p>and psychological perspectives include behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism,
</p>
<p>connectivism, and humanism.
</p>
<p>2.2.1 Behaviorism
</p>
<p>Behaviorism was elaborated by Watson, among others. Watson was an American
</p>
<p>psychologist whose research was published in the early part of the twentieth cen-
</p>
<p>tury. Behaviorism was dominant in American psychology for half a century from
</p>
<p>the 1920s to the 1960s and remains one of the most important schools of American
</p>
<p>psychology. The main representatives of behaviorism include John B. Watson
</p>
<p>(1878&ndash;1958), Burrhus F. Skinner (1904&ndash;1990), and Edward L. Thorndike (1874&ndash;
</p>
<p>1949).
</p>
<p>Main ideas
</p>
<p>Behaviorism is a perspective that focuses almost exclusively on directly observable
</p>
<p>things to explain learning (Spector, 2016). That which is directly observed and
</p>
<p>believed most relevant to learning are the immediate things in the learner&rsquo;s envi-
</p>
<p>ronment, and most closely contiguous in time and place to the targeted learning&mdash;
</p>
<p>the so-called stimulus conditions for learning. The response of the learner to the
</p>
<p>stimulus is also directly observable and serves as an indicator of learning (Spector,
</p>
<p>2016).
</p>
<p>The major idea of behaviorism includes the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; The learning process is a gradual attempt and error until the consistent success
</p>
<p>is attained.
</p>
<p>&bull; The key to learning success depends on reinforcement.
</p>
<p>&bull; Learning involves a stimulus&ndash;response sequence.
</p>
<p>Edward L. Thorndike (1905) developed an stimulus&ndash;response (S-R) theory of
</p>
<p>learning. In stimulus&ndash;response theory, knowledge is defined as a learner&rsquo;s collec-
</p>
<p>tion of specific responses to stimuli that are represented in behavioral objectives
</p>
<p>(Koehler &amp; colleagues, 2014). Edward L. Thorndike noted that responses (or
</p>
<p>behavior) were strengthened or weakened by the consequences of behavior: (1) a
</p>
<p>response to a stimulus is reinforced when followed by a positive rewarding effect,
</p>
<p>and (2) a response to a stimulus becomes stronger by exercise and repetition.
</p>
<p>Different reinforcement patterns (i.e., continuous or intermittent) have been shown
</p>
<p>to have a different impact on learning outcomes (Ferster &amp; Skinner, 1957).
</p>
<p>Behaviorism puts emphasis on the importance of the environment during indi-
</p>
<p>vidual learning. According to behaviorism theory, teaching is to control the learning
</p>
<p>2.2 Learning Theories 35</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>environment to achieve the desired results, and the main method of controlling
</p>
<p>learning behavior is to strengthen the correct response. Behaviorism pioneer,
</p>
<p>Watson (1930) said,
</p>
<p>Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them
</p>
<p>up in and I will guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of
</p>
<p>specialist I might select &ndash; doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man
</p>
<p>and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of
</p>
<p>his ancestors. I am going beyond my facts and I admit it, but so have the advocates of the
</p>
<p>contrary and they have been doing it for many thousands of years (Watson, 1930, p. 82).
</p>
<p>The impact on teaching
</p>
<p>Burrhus F. Skinner (1953) proposed operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is
</p>
<p>a type of learning in which the strength of a behavior is modified by the behavior&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>consequences, such as reward or punishment. In operant conditioning, stimuli are
</p>
<p>present when a behavior is rewarded or punished to control that behavior. For
</p>
<p>example, a child may learn to open a box to get the candy inside, or learn to avoid
</p>
<p>touching a hot stove; the box and the stove are discriminative stimuli.
</p>
<p>According to operant conditioning, the probability of the behavior occurring in
</p>
<p>this scenario is enhanced by the reinforcement. Learning is understood as the
</p>
<p>step-by-step or successive approximation of the intended partial behaviors by the
</p>
<p>use of reward and punishment.
</p>
<p>Programmed instruction is based on Skinner&rsquo;s operant conditioning. It is a
</p>
<p>method of presenting new subject matters for students in a graded sequence of
</p>
<p>controlled steps.
</p>
<p>&bull; According to programmed instruction, the textbooks are divided into small
</p>
<p>frames and small steps, and each frame has its own goals. Learners could
</p>
<p>achieve their goals through certain learning procedures.
</p>
<p>&bull; Students work through the programmed material by themselves at their own
</p>
<p>speed. After each step, we can test their comprehension by answering an
</p>
<p>examination question or filling in a diagram. They are then immediately shown
</p>
<p>the correct answer or given additional information (The Columbia Encyclope-
</p>
<p>dia, 2001).
</p>
<p>&bull; Instruction is self-paced, and learners are required to be active by completing
</p>
<p>exercises and tests and proceeding based on feedback from the instruction.
</p>
<p>The learning essence of behaviorism is the change of the external behavior
</p>
<p>caused by the environment. Impacts on teaching are that the desired results could be
</p>
<p>achieved through controlling the learning environments, while the main measures
</p>
<p>of control learning include present stimulus, provide practice, feedback and rein-
</p>
<p>forcement, such as strengthening the correct response.

</p>
<p>A Skinner box, also known as operant conditioning chamber, is an enclosed
</p>
<p>apparatus that contains a bar or key that an animal can press or manipulate in
</p>
<p>order to obtain food or water as a type of reinforcement. Developed by
</p>
<p>B. F. Skinner, this box also had a device that recorded each response provided
</p>
<p>by the animal as well as the unique schedule of reinforcement that the animal
</p>
<p>was assigned.
</p>
<p>When put into the box, the cat would show evident signs of discomfort and impulse
</p>
<p>to escape from confinement. It tries to squeeze through any opening; it claws and
</p>
<p>bites at the wire; it thrusts its paws out through any opening and claws at everything
</p>
<p>it reaches&hellip;. It does not pay very much attention to the food outside but seems
</p>
<p>simply to strive instinctively to escape from confinement. The cat that is clawing all
</p>
<p>over the box in her impulsive struggle will probably claw the string or loop or button
</p>
<p>so as to open the door. And gradually all the other unsuccessful impulses will be
</p>
<p>stamped out and the particular impulse leading to the successful act will be stamped
</p>
<p>in by the resulting pleasure, until, after many trials, the cat will, when put in the box,
</p>
<p>immediately claw the button or loop in a definite way (Thorndike, 1898, p. 13).
</p>
<p>2.2.2 Cognitivism
</p>
<p>Cognitivism psychology was initiated in the late 1950s and became dominant in the
</p>
<p>late 1970s and the early 1980s. The main representatives include Jean Piaget
</p>
<p>(1896&ndash;1980), Jerome S. Bruner (1915&ndash;2016), David P. Ausubel (1918&ndash;2008), and
</p>
<p>Robert M. Gagn&eacute; (1916&ndash;2002), among others.
</p>
<p>Cognitivism arose within psychology as behaviorism was proved to be insuffi-
</p>
<p>cient to explain complex human learning, such as language learning. In order to
</p>
<p>explain some human behaviors, psychologists turned to investigate the information
</p>
<p>processing in the mind which is considered as unobservable black box by behav-
</p>
<p>iorists (Spector, 2016). People are no longer viewed as collections of responses to
</p>
<p>external stimuli as understood by behaviorists, but as information processors.
</p>
<p>Main ideas
</p>
<p>In cognitive psychology, learning is conceptualized as the acquisition of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge: The learner is an information processor who absorbs information, undertakes
</p>
<p>cognitive operations on it, and stocks it in memory.
</p>
<p>According to cognitivism, learning is not a stimulus&ndash;response sequence, but the
</p>
<p>formation of cognitive structures. The learners do not simply receive stimuli
</p>
<p>mechanically and react passively, but, rather, learners process stimuli and determine
</p>
<p>appropriate responses.
</p>
<p>Cognitivism has its roots in cognitive psychology and information processing
</p>
<p>theory. The best way to introduce cognitivism is through Anderson&rsquo;s (1983)
</p>
<p>2.2 Learning Theories 37</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ACT-R model of information processing (see http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/publication/).
</p>
<p>Information processing theory involves how people receive, store, integrate,
</p>
<p>retrieve, and use information. The basic idea of the information processing theory is
</p>
<p>that the human mind is like a computer or information processor.
</p>
<p>This model proposes that information is processed and stored in three stages:
</p>
<p>sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. They are assumed to
</p>
<p>receive information from environment and transform it for storage and use in
</p>
<p>memory and performance (Huitt, 2003).
</p>
<p>&bull; A learner&rsquo;s environment activates the receptors (sense), and information is then
</p>
<p>transmitted through the sensory memory to short-term memory in selected and
</p>
<p>recognizable patterns (7 plus or minus 2 chunks of information). The infor-
</p>
<p>mation is held in short-term memory for about 20&ndash;30 s (unless rehearsed), and
</p>
<p>then, the information to be acquired is transformed by a process known as
</p>
<p>semantic encoding to a form that enters long-term memory (Cognitivism and
</p>
<p>Gagne&rsquo;s Model of Learning, 1970). With sensory memory, learners perceive
</p>
<p>organized patterns in the environment and begin the process of recognizing and
</p>
<p>coding these patterns.
</p>
<p>&bull; Short-term memory (working memory) permits the learner to hold information
</p>
<p>briefly in mind to make further sense of it and to connect it with other infor-
</p>
<p>mation that is already in long-term memory.
</p>
<p>&bull; Long-term memory enables the learner to remember and apply information long
</p>
<p>after it was originally learned.
</p>
<p>Impact on teaching
</p>
<p>As a cognitive psychologist, Gagn&eacute; (1985) proposed nine events of instruction
</p>
<p>and conditions of learning as effective means to activate and support the processes
</p>
<p>of information processing. Table 2.1 shows these instructional events in the left
</p>
<p>column and the associated internal mental process in the right column.
</p>
<p>The impact on teaching from cognitivism is as the following:
</p>
<p>(1) In the design of computer-aided instruction, people began to pay attention to
</p>
<p>the internal psychological process of learners and then began to study and
</p>
<p>emphasize the learners&rsquo; psychological characteristics and cognitive structures.
</p>
<p>(2) Educators no longer regard learning as the learner&rsquo;s passive response to
</p>
<p>external stimuli, but consider learning as involving attitudes, needs, interests,
</p>
<p>hobbies, and cognitive structures.
</p>
<p>(3) The teacher&rsquo;s task is to try to arouse the learners&rsquo; interest and motivation and
</p>
<p>then combine the current teaching content with the original knowledge and
</p>
<p>experience of the learners.

<p>world in different ways. The two basic processes of adaptation are assimi-
</p>
<p>lation and accommodation, and they cannot be separated. Assimilation was to
</p>
<p>describe the learning process through which a child picks up new concepts
</p>
<p>and ideas and absorbs them into the existing concepts and ideas. Accom-
</p>
<p>modation is different from assimilation. It is the process of reorganization and
</p>
<p>changes in a child&rsquo;s cognitive structures caused by the inability to assimilate
</p>
<p>the information in existing structures.
</p>
<p>&bull; David P. Ausubel: Cognitive Assimilation Theory
</p>
<p>Ausubel was influenced by the teachings of Jean Piaget. He puts forward
</p>
<p>cognitive assimilation theory, which focuses on what he describes as mean-
</p>
<p>ingful learning. It is a process where new information is related to an existing
</p>
<p>relevant aspect of the individual&rsquo;s knowledge structure. According to the
</p>
<p>cognitive assimilation theory, whether students can learn new knowledge
</p>
<p>meaningfully depends on the existing concepts in their cognitive structure.
</p>
<p>These concepts can be used to connect the knowledge with the existing
</p>
<p>knowledge for the learner, and find or form relevant concepts in the original
</p>
<p>cognitive structure. The meaning of new knowledge is needed to incorporate
</p>
<p>into their own cognitive structure and form their own understanding, while
</p>
<p>some changes have taken place in the original cognitive structure.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2.3 Constructivism
</p>
<p>Constructivism emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as an extension of cognitivism that
</p>
<p>included an emphasis on internal mental constructions and the influence of others
</p>
<p>on an individual&rsquo;s learning. The main ideas are based on the works of John Dewey
</p>
<p>(1859&ndash;1952) and Lev Vygotsky (1896&ndash;1934).
</p>
<p>Main ideas
</p>
<p>Constructivism holds that learning is the process of constructing internal psycho-
</p>
<p>logical representation in the process of the interaction with the environment.
</p>
<p>Helping learners involves helping them to understand the nature, regularity, and the
</p>
<p>inner connections among things (Chen &amp; Liu, 2011). The basic elements of con-
</p>
<p>structivism include context, collaboration, conversation, and meaning-making.
</p>
<p>From constructivism, learning could be understood in the following ways.
</p>
<p>(1) Learning is or should be learner-centered.
</p>
<p>(2) Learning is the process by which learners construct internal psychological
</p>
<p>representation actively.
</p>
<p>(3) The learning process consists of two aspects: the reorganization and recon-
</p>
<p>struction of old knowledge and the meaningful construction of new knowledge.
</p>
<p>(4) Learning is not only an individualized behavior, but also a social and
</p>
<p>language-centered behavior; learning requires communication and cooperation.
</p>
<p>(5) Learning involves emphasizing the situation of learning and attaching impor-
</p>
<p>tance to the creation of meaningful situations to support learning.
</p>
<p>(6) Effective learning requires appropriate resources to support meaning
</p>
<p>construction.
</p>
<p>The impact on teaching
</p>
<p>According to constructivism, teachers should not teach in the traditional way, but
</p>
<p>should encourage students to cooperate or interact with peers. Students should
</p>
<p>process information and construct meaning of knowledge actively, rather than listen
</p>
<p>to teachers passively. The impact of constructivism on teaching is as follows:
</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention to the design of learning scenario. The teacher should design
</p>
<p>multi-dimensional learning scenarios, so that learners can understand the
</p>
<p>concept of principles from various aspects, and then develop problem-solving,
</p>
<p>decision-making, and innovation capabilities.
</p>
<p>(2) Emphasize the learner&rsquo;s active role. Focus on cultivating students&rsquo;
</p>
<p>self-management skills to stimulate the necessary psychological state and prior
</p>
<p>knowledge for learning.
</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to the contribution of error concept to learning. Situated cog-
</p>
<p>nition theory treats the aim and process as unity. Therefore, even the erroneous
</p>
<p>concept being produced in the process of learning, it also has a positive
</p>
<p>contribution to the construction of the whole knowledge structure.

<p>Extended Reading:
</p>
<p>Fish Is Fish (Lionni, 1970) describes a fish who is keenly interested in
</p>
<p>learning about what happens on land, but the fish cannot explore land because
</p>
<p>it can only live in water. It befriends a tadpole who grows into a frog and
</p>
<p>eventually goes out onto the land. The frog returns to the pond a few weeks
</p>
<p>later and reports on what he has seen. The frog describes all kinds of things
</p>
<p>like birds, cows, and people. The book shows pictures of the fish&rsquo;s repre-
</p>
<p>sentations of each of these descriptions: Each is a fishlike form that is slightly
</p>
<p>adapted to accommodate the frog&rsquo;s descriptions&mdash;people are imagined to be
</p>
<p>fish who walk on their tailfins, birds are fish with wings, and cows are fish
</p>
<p>with udders. This tale illustrates both the creative opportunities and dangers
</p>
<p>inherent in the fact that people construct new knowledge based on their
</p>
<p>current knowledge. (Go to the Web site for the image. https://www.ectaveo.

</p>
<p>Social constructivism
</p>
<p>Constructivism can be viewed simply as individual/cognitive constructivism,
</p>
<p>whereas social constructivism recognizes the role of language and others in
</p>
<p>learning. The main idea is that learning is a meaning construction process. The
</p>
<p>individual constructivism is mainly developed on the basis of Piaget&rsquo;s thoughts.
</p>
<p>According to Piaget&rsquo;s theory of cognitive development, learning is the process by
</p>
<p>which learners form, enrich, and adjust their cognitive structures through the
</p>
<p>interaction of new and old knowledge and experiences. The two main cognitive
</p>
<p>processes involved are assimilation (using an existing mental construct or schema
</p>
<p>in a new situation) and accommodation (altering an existing schema or creating a
</p>
<p>new one based on a new situation).
</p>
<p>Social constructivism focuses on the social and cultural mechanisms behind the
</p>
<p>construction of learning and knowledge. The basic view is that learning is a process
</p>
<p>of cultural participation, and learners participate in a community&rsquo;s practical activ-
</p>
<p>ities to learn the related knowledge through the support of certain culture.
</p>
<p>Knowledge is not only constructed during the interaction between individual and
</p>
<p>physical environment, but also the interaction of social culture (Chen &amp; Liu, 2011).
</p>
<p>The main representative of social constructivism is Lev Vygotsky. Vygotsky&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>social constructivist theory highlights the following aspects:
</p>
<p>(1) Social and cultural interactions play a very important role in the learning
</p>
<p>process.
</p>
<p>(2) Knowledge is co-constructed and that individuals can learn from one another.
</p>
<p>(3) The learner must be engaged in the learning process. Learning happens with
</p>
<p>the assistance of other people.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Based on the research of the socio-constructivism, Vygotsky (1987) puts for-
</p>
<p>ward the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). This is a &ldquo;range of tasks that are
</p>
<p>too difficult for an individual to master alone, but can be mastered with the assis-
</p>
<p>tance or guidance of adults or more-skilled peers (Vygotsky, 1987).&rdquo; Another part
</p>
<p>of this theory is scaffolding, which emphasizes to give the learner the right amount
</p>
<p>of assistance at the right time. If the learner can perform a task with some assis-
</p>
<p>tance, then he or she is closer to mastering it. These theories have an important
</p>
<p>influence and enlightenment on teaching, and some new teaching methods have
</p>
<p>formed, such as anchored instruction, cooperative learning, and reciprocal
</p>
<p>instruction.
</p>
<p>Extended reading:
</p>
<p>&bull; Anchored instruction
</p>
<p>Refers to instruction in which the material to be learned is presented in the context of
</p>
<p>an authentic event that serves to anchor or situate the material and, further, allows it
</p>
<p>to be examined from multiple perspectives. (Bransford et al., 1990, p. 5)
</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborative learning
</p>
<p>Collaborative learning involves working together as a group to accomplish shared
</p>
<p>goals to maximize the learning of each individual. (Huang &amp; Liu, 2001)
</p>
<p>&bull; Reciprocal instruction
</p>
<p>Reciprocal instruction is an instructional activity that takes the form of a dialogue
</p>
<p>between teachers and students regarding segments of text for the purpose of con-
</p>
<p>structing the meaning of text. (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1986)
</p>
<p>2.2.4 Other Learning Theories
</p>
<p>Besides behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism, there are many other
</p>
<p>learning theories, which play an important role in guiding teaching and learning
</p>
<p>activities, such as connectivism and humanism.
</p>
<p>2.2.4.1 Connectivism
Over the last twenty years, technology has changed how we live, how we com-
</p>
<p>municate, and how we learn. With the development of the information technology,
</p>
<p>such as social networking and cloud computing, connectivism has been put forward
</p>
<p>and gained increasing attention. The main representatives include George Siemens
</p>
<p>and Stephen Downes.
</p>
<p>42 2 Learning in the Context of Technologies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Main ideas
</p>
<p>Connectivism is a hypothesis of learning which emphasizes the role of social and
</p>
<p>cultural context. It is the integration of principles from chaos, network, and com-
</p>
<p>plexity and self-organization theories. The central aspect of connectivism is the
</p>
<p>metaphor of a network with nodes and connections (Siemens, 2005). In this
</p>
<p>metaphor, a node is anything that can be connected to another node such as an
</p>
<p>organization, information, data, feelings, and images. In this sense, connectivism
</p>
<p>proposes to see knowledge&rsquo;s structure as a network and learning as a process of
</p>
<p>pattern recognition (AlDahdouh, Os&oacute;rio, Caires &amp; Susana, 2015).
</p>
<p>According to connectivism, learning is creating networks (Fig. 2.1). Nodes are
</p>
<p>external entities, which can be used to form a network. The nodes may be people,
</p>
<p>organizations, libraries, Web sites, books, database, or any other source of infor-
</p>
<p>mation. The act of learning is creating an external network of nodes, where we
</p>
<p>connect information and knowledge sources. The learning that happens in our heads
</p>
<p>is an internal network (neural). Learning networks can then be perceived as
</p>
<p>structures that we create in order to stay current and continually acquire experience,
</p>
<p>create, and connect new knowledge (external). Learning networks can be perceived
</p>
<p>as structures that exist within our minds (internal) in connecting and creating pat-
</p>
<p>terns of understanding (Siemens, 2006).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2.4.2 Humanism
Humanism emerged in the 1950s and became popular after the 1960s. Humanistic
</p>
<p>psychologists believe that the school should integrate the concept and practice of
</p>
<p>moral education into various teaching activities and help the students to develop a
</p>
<p>sound personality. The main representative includes Abraham Maslow (1908&ndash;
</p>
<p>1970) and Carl Rogers (1902&ndash;1987).
</p>
<p>Main ideas
</p>
<p>Humanism is a perspective that focuses on the value of the individual and personal
</p>
<p>freedom. According to humanism, each person has the ability to develop his or her
</p>
<p>own potential and motivation. Individuals can freely choose their own development
</p>
<p>direction and value. Humanism focuses on human&rsquo;s overall development, empha-
</p>
<p>sizes human dignity and value, and pays attention to the health and integrity of
</p>
<p>people. Humanism investigates mainly how to create a good environment for
</p>
<p>learners to perceive the world from their point of view and develop an under-
</p>
<p>standing of the world, aiming to achieve the highest level of self-realization.
</p>
<p>2.3 Technology-Enhanced Learning
</p>
<p>Learning theories and technologies are connected and intertwined by information
</p>
<p>processing and knowledge acquisition (Spector &amp; colleagues, 2014). In order to
</p>
<p>understand the technology-enhanced learning, it is useful to look at the technologies
</p>
<p>used in different periods of history when the different learning theories emerged and
</p>
<p>became popularity (Fig. 2.2).
</p>
<p>(1) From the 1920s to the 1960s, behaviorism was proposed and came to be
</p>
<p>dominant. Some technologies were adopted in the process of teaching, such as the
</p>
<p>automatic teaching machine, chemo-card, etc.
</p>
<p>In 1924, the psychologist Sidney L. Pressey designed the first teaching machine,
</p>
<p>which is suitable for rote-and-drill learning (Fig. 2.2). It was mainly used for
</p>
<p>automated testing of students. It also includes the principle of allowing students to
</p>
<p>set their own pace, positive response, and timely feedback. The automatic teaching
</p>
<p>machine includes two modes of operation: quiz and learning. He believes that
</p>
<p>&ldquo;teaching machines are unique among instructional aids, in that the student not
</p>
<p>merely passively listen, watches, or reads but actively responds. In addition, stu-
</p>
<p>dents could find out whether his response is correct or not, and a record may be kept
</p>
<p>which aids in improving the materials.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Extended Reading:Teaching Machines (Benjamin, 1988)
</p>
<p>B. F. Skinner was also interested in a teaching machine. He conceptualized
</p>
<p>a teaching machine for the classroom for use by individual students. In 1954,
</p>
<p>B. F. Skinner published &ldquo;The Science of Learning and the Art of Teaching&rdquo;
</p>
<p>44 2 Learning in the Context of Technologies</p>

<p>which is suggested that the use of teaching machines can solve many
</p>
<p>teaching problems and promote the development of program teaching
</p>
<p>movement at that time. He designed teaching machine and program teaching
</p>
<p>according to the theory of operational conditioning and positive
</p>
<p>reinforcement.
</p>
<p>If you want to read more concerning the teaching machine, please read A History of
</p>
<p>Teaching Machine (Benjamin, 1988).
</p>
<p>In 1930, J. Peterson designed chemo-card which can support automatic scoring
</p>
<p>and timely feedback.
</p>
<p>(2) Cognitivism became dominant in the 1970s and 1980s. Many early educa-
</p>
<p>tional technology developments occurred in university settings, and these were
</p>
<p>often associated with various computer technologies, such as PLATO (Programmed
</p>
<p>Logic for Automated Teaching Operations) and Logo.
</p>
<p>PLATO (see https://chip.web.ischool.illinois.edu/people/projects/timeline/
</p>
<p>1960won.html) was the first generalized computer-assisted instruction system
</p>
<p>developed in the 1960s at the University of Illinois. It developed many tools to
</p>
<p>support the design, development, and deployment of learning environments. Many
</p>
<p>modern concepts in multi-user computing were developed in PLATO, including
</p>
<p>forums, message boards, online testing, e-mail, chat rooms, picture languages,
</p>
<p>instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and multi-player games.
</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the Logo programming language was introduced to support many
</p>
<p>instructional activities, and some people thought it would revolutionize teaching
</p>
<p>and learning in schools (Spector, 2016). In 1980, Seymour Papert introduced Logo.
</p>
<p>It was the first language specifically designed to enable children to learn by
</p>
<p>discovery.

<p>(3) From the 1980s, constructivism started to become dominant. Interactive
</p>
<p>multimedia, Internet, and other modern technologies were applied in teaching and
</p>
<p>learning. In the technology-supported learning environments, learners could con-
</p>
<p>struct their knowledge actively in interaction with the environment and through the
</p>
<p>reorganization of their mental structures.
</p>
<p>(4) With the rapid development of information technology, MOOCs, social
</p>
<p>networking, cloud computing, etc., are widely used in teaching and learning. The
</p>
<p>connection between people and people, people and knowledge, knowledge and
</p>
<p>knowledge changed from ideal to reality. MOOCs are used in distance education
</p>
<p>which were first introduced in 2006 and emerged as a popular mode of learning in
</p>
<p>2012 (Lewin, 2013). It is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and
</p>
<p>open access via the Web (Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2016). Learning analytics is the use
</p>
<p>of intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to discover infor-
</p>
<p>mation and social connections for predicting and advising people&rsquo;s learning (Sie-
</p>
<p>mens, 2010).
</p>
<p>Information technology has become an important tool of education, and it is not
</p>
<p>only rich in information resources, but also can extend human capacity and expand
</p>
<p>the social environment of supporting learning. The history of technology and
</p>
<p>learning theory&rsquo;s development reflects an evolution from individual toward com-
</p>
<p>munity learning, from content-driven learning toward process-driven approaches,
</p>
<p>from isolated media toward integrated use, from presentation media toward inter-
</p>
<p>active media, from learning settings dependent on place and time toward ubiquitous
</p>
<p>learning, and from fixed tools toward handheld devices.
</p>
<p>In the future, with the development of information technology, learning theories
</p>
<p>will be improved and developed further. The theories of instructional design will be
</p>
<p>more mature and more scientific. The practice of educational technology will
</p>
<p>promote the continuous development of the learning theory and will promote each
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>1. Learning theories are conceptual frameworks describing how knowledge is
</p>
<p>absorbed, processed, and retained during learning. In the process of designing
</p>
<p>and developing instructional systems, learning environments and learning
</p>
<p>activities relevant to learning theories and psychological perspectives include
</p>
<p>behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, connectivism, and humanism.
</p>
<p>2. The major idea of behaviorism includes: (1) The learning process is a gradual
</p>
<p>attempt and error until the consistent success is attained. (2) The key to learning
</p>
<p>success depends on reinforcement. (3) Learning involves a stimulus&ndash;response
</p>
<p>sequence.
</p>
<p>3. The nine instructional events include: gain attention, inform learners of objec-
</p>
<p>tives, stimulate recall of prior knowledge, present the content, provide guidance
</p>
<p>for learning, elicit performance &ldquo;practice,&rdquo; provide informative feedback, assess
</p>
<p>performance test, and enhance retention and transfer.

<p>4. Constructivism believes that learning is the process of constructing internal
</p>
<p>psychological representation in the process of the interaction with the envi-
</p>
<p>ronment. The constructivism emphasizes learner-centered, situational, collabo-
</p>
<p>rative, and meaningful construction.
</p>
<p>5. The technology and learning theory have interactions. Learning theories and
</p>
<p>technologies are connected and intertwined by information processing and
</p>
<p>knowledge acquisition. With the rapid development of information technology,
</p>
<p>MOOCs, social networking, cloud computing, etc., are widely used in teaching
</p>
<p>and learning.
</p>
<p>Learning resources
</p>
<p>&bull; Behaviorism could not explain how children acquire a natural language; also,
</p>
<p>about the time, mainframe computers were spreading a model of cognitive
</p>
<p>architecture which was developed with the mind being analogous to a computer
</p>
<p>processor&mdash;see http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/, Anderson (1983), and the ACT-R

</p>
<p>Main Learning Activities
</p>
<p>1. Think about what kind of pedagogies that have been mentioned in this chapter
</p>
<p>that impact the selection of appropriate technologies. What other pedagogies can
</p>
<p>be added in the selection of appropriate technologies? What pedagogical
</p>
<p>approach has been used in this chapter? What additional strategies and tech-
</p>
<p>nologies would you recommend to go with this chapter in a classroom setting?
</p>
<p>2. Suppose you are planning to teach an 8-grade student about ocean tides (or
</p>
<p>another learning task of your choosing). Identify an appropriate learning
</p>
<p>objective for a lesson about ocean tides. Then indicate an appropriate peda-
</p>
<p>gogical approach to support that objective. Next, consider affordable tech-
</p>
<p>nologies that could be used to support such a lesson.

<p>3.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we argue that a theoretically consistent approach to learning design
</p>
<p>is to interrelate pedagogical theory with the desired features of learning, and then to
</p>
<p>map relevant activities and tools along with human and technical resources against
</p>
<p>learning goals and an appropriate pedagogical approach. This approach is intended
</p>
<p>to enable educational practice to reflect relevant learning theories. Different learning
</p>
<p>theories and epistemologies (e.g., behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism) lead to
</p>
<p>various conceptions of information processing and knowledge development that
</p>
<p>influence effective technology use. Given the central functionality of education to
</p>
<p>help learners acquire and develop declarative, procedural and contextual knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, learning theories and technologies are fellow travelers.
</p>
<p>The idea of linking learning theories and technologies became important as
</p>
<p>learning theories become more mature (i.e., cognitivism and social constructivism),
</p>
<p>and new technologies became affordable and commonplace (e.g., the Internet,
</p>
<p>social networking). The critical appraisal of the link between learning theories and
</p>
<p>technologies can be structured around the following observations: (1) changes in
</p>
<p>society and education have influenced the selection and use of learning theories and
</p>
<p>technologies; (2) learning theories and technologies are situated in a broad and
</p>
<p>ill-defined conceptual field; (3) learning theories and technologies are connected
</p>
<p>and intertwined with information processing and knowledge acquisition and
</p>
<p>development; (4) educational technologies have shifted in emphasis from program
</p>
<p>or instructor control toward more shared and learner control; and (5) learning
</p>
<p>theories and findings represent a complex mixture of principles and applications
</p>
<p>(Spector, Merrill, van Merri&euml;nboer, &amp; Driscoll, 2008). In this chapter, the phrases
</p>
<p>&ldquo;pedagogical approach&rdquo; and &ldquo;instructional strategy&rdquo; are used interchangeably,
</p>
<p>although some scholars argue that there are differences in that learning includes
</p>
<p>non-formal situations as well as structured and formal learning situations.
</p>
<p>3.2 Linking Instructional Strategies to Learning
Objectives
</p>
<p>3.2.1 Types of Learning Objectives
</p>
<p>In the analysis phase of planning instruction, it is reasonable for a designer to
</p>
<p>consider the kinds of things to be learned (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001).
</p>
<p>According to Gagn&eacute; (1985), there are five different kinds of things that can be
</p>
<p>learned: (a) verbal information (e.g., facts, as in knowing that), (b) cognitive
</p>
<p>strategies (e.g., selecting a process to address a problem situation, as in knowing
</p>
<p>why and when), (c) intellectual skills (e.g., using rules to solve a problem, as in
</p>
<p>knowing how), (d) motor skills (e.g., riding a bicycle, as in performing well), and
</p>
<p>(e) attitudes (e.g., fascination with science, as in being interested in or inclined to)
</p>
<p>(see Table 3.1).
</p>

<p>Definitions
</p>
<p>Motor skills: include physical skills and bodily movements involving muscular
</p>
<p>activity. Examples of motor skills are drawing a straight line, learning to ride a
</p>
<p>bicycle, changing a flat tire. Many motor skills also require verbal information,
</p>
<p>cognitive strategies, and intellectual. As it happens, nearly all of the five types of
</p>
<p>things to be learned involve some aspects of another learning type, but usually one
</p>
<p>type of thing be learned is dominant.
</p>
<p>Verbal information: knowing that something is the case, for example, knowing
</p>
<p>that there are 24 h in a day or that tides occur twice daily; also known as,
</p>
<p>declarative knowledge. Examples of verbal information include knowing that
</p>
<p>insects have six legs or that a byte consists of eight bits (zeros or ones).
</p>
<p>Cognitive strategy: refers to selecting an appropriate approach to solve a par-
</p>
<p>ticular problem; a cognitive process that involves awareness of the problem as well
</p>
<p>as awareness of one&rsquo;s own knowledge and ability relevant to the problem, also
</p>
<p>known as contextual or causal knowledge. Examples of cognitive strategies include
</p>
<p>using a split-half approach to solving a troubleshooting problem or applying a
</p>
<p>bubble sorting algorithm for a selected data set.
</p>
<p>Intellectual skills: Learning how to do something; also known as procedural
</p>
<p>knowledge. Subskills include discrimination, concept application, rule using, and
</p>
<p>problem solving; intellectual skills are also known as procedural knowledge.
</p>
<p>Examples of intellectual skills include solving equations, sorting objects into cat-
</p>
<p>egories, and identifying relevant principles to apply in particular situations.
</p>
<p>Attitudes: internal states which affect an individual&rsquo;s choice of action toward
</p>
<p>some object, person, or event. Example of attitudes is being predisposed to react in
</p>
<p>certain ways and having a particular interest in something.
</p>
<p>Discrimination: Identifying things so as to be able to make different responses
</p>
<p>to the different members of a particular class. Examples of discrimination tasks
</p>
<p>include distinguishing different classes of objects, such as flowers, dogs, vegetables,
</p>
<p>and people of different nationalities.

<p>solving
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Concept application: identifying and using appropriate concepts (both concrete
</p>
<p>and abstract concepts). Examples of concrete objects include chairs and tables.
</p>
<p>Examples of abstract objects include hate and social cohesion.
</p>
<p>Rule using: applying a rule to a given situation or condition by responding to a
</p>
<p>class of inputs with a class of actions. An example of rule using is to multiple the
</p>
<p>probabilities of individual events to determine the probability of both events
</p>
<p>happening.
</p>
<p>Problem solving: combining lower level rules to solve challenging problems.
</p>
<p>Solving problems is the aim of most learning tasks and the tasks are often
</p>
<p>complicated.
</p>
<p>The main point is that the type of thing to be learned is an important aspect of
</p>
<p>instructional planning as it links to learning objectives, activities, outcomes, and
</p>
<p>assessments. The type of thing to be learned can help one identify a likely
</p>
<p>instructional method and strategy. There are, of course, other aspects to be taken
</p>
<p>into account, including the learners, their prior knowledge, and the setting in which
</p>
<p>learning will take place (see, for example, Eckel, 1993; Spector, Johnson, &amp; Young,
</p>
<p>2014).
</p>
<p>3.2.2 Instructional Strategies and Types of Learning
Objectives
</p>
<p>An instructional strategy is a description of an approach to a particular instructional
</p>
<p>or learning activity. Instructional strategies are closely linked with the type of thing
</p>
<p>to be learned. For example, if the thing to be learned is how to remove the radar
</p>
<p>from an airplane, then it would not be appropriate to only use expository (i.e.,
</p>
<p>telling) or inquisitory (i.e., asking) instruction. This is a procedural task that is best
</p>
<p>learned by showing and doing&mdash;of course, some information is necessary such as
</p>
<p>where the radar unit is located and what safety precautions must be taken.
</p>
<p>A strategy for learning such a task could be a combination of demonstrating and
</p>
<p>modeling the task, and then having learners perform the task, with feedback pro-
</p>
<p>vided along the way. A variation could be breaking the task down into subtasks and
</p>
<p>using a part-task approach. For example, the first preparatory steps (e.g., turning off
</p>
<p>all systems and removing panels to gain access to the radar unit) might be treated as
</p>
<p>one chunk and practice until mastered. There are many instructional strategies that
</p>
<p>instructional theorists have developed over the years in addition to the general
</p>
<p>expository and inquisitory strategies mentioned earlier. Examples include the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing (these are only meant to be suggestive, as alternative strategies might be
</p>
<p>appropriate for the instances cited and this list is far from exhaustive):
</p>
<p>a. Drill and practice&mdash;appropriate for learning verbal information that for what-
</p>
<p>ever reason must be committed to memory.
</p>
<p>b. Tutorial instruction&mdash;appropriate for learning simple procedures or how to
</p>
<p>navigate within a particular software system.
</p>
<p>52 3 Linking Learning Objectives, Pedagogies, and Technologies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>c. Exploratory instruction&mdash;appropriate for promoting understanding about
</p>
<p>phenomena new to the learner.
</p>
<p>d. Interactive simulation&mdash;appropriate for promoting critical reasoning about
</p>
<p>dynamic, complex systems.
</p>
<p>e. Socratic questioning&mdash;appropriate for helping a learner link something new
</p>
<p>and seemingly unfamiliar to something already understood.
</p>
<p>f. Lecture&mdash;appropriate for introducing a new topic and creating some motivation
</p>
<p>and an appropriate foundation for that topic.
</p>
<p>Of course, there are many more strategies, and they can be applied in many
</p>
<p>ways. At a course level, the general approach might be an experiential strategy, but
</p>
<p>at the unit level a lecture might be effective to introduce basic concepts, and at the
</p>
<p>activity level, a case-based collaborative discourse or an interactive simulation
</p>
<p>might be effective. What is important is to align the strategy with the type of thing
</p>
<p>to be learned. Determining the appropriate strategy for a particular task is an
</p>
<p>important aspect of instructional design, as already mentioned multiple times. The
</p>
<p>designer takes into account various strategies suggested by an instructional theory
</p>
<p>and relevant learning theory, along with the type of thing to be learned and the
</p>
<p>learners involved, and then describes how to deploy those strategies in order to
</p>
<p>achieve optimal learning outcomes (Table 3.2).
</p>
<p>Mastery Learning
</p>
<p>The mastery learning model is based on the assumption that all students of a class
</p>
<p>can learn and attain the mastery level if sufficient time, adequate instruction, and
</p>
<p>timely help are provided to them according to their needs, interests, and abilities
</p>
<p>(Schwartz &amp; Beichner, 1998). Therefore, the model focuses on attaining mastery
</p>
<p>level (i.e., grade A as an indicator of mastery of a subject) by almost all the
</p>
<p>students, say 95% of a class with due provisions of sufficient time and appropriate
</p>
<p>types of scaffolding and feedback (i.e., help; see Bloom, 1971).
</p>
<p>Programmed Learning
</p>
<p>Generally, the learning performed or instruction provided by a teaching machine or
</p>
<p>programmed textbook is referred to as programmed learning or instruction. Pro-
</p>
<p>grammed learning is a method or technique of giving or receiving individualized
</p>
<p>instruction from a variety of sources such as programmed textbook, teaching
</p>
<p>machine, and computers with or without the help of a teacher (Schwartz &amp;
</p>
<p>Beichner, 1998).
</p>
<p>Simulation
</p>

<p>Direct Teaching
</p>
<p>Direct teaching is the pedagogy that makes mastering academic knowledge and
</p>
<p>skills its central purpose. It can also be used to develop strategies for learning in a
</p>
<p>wide variety of content areas (Schwartz &amp; Beichner, 1998). Behavioral pedagogical
</p>
<p>approach is appropriate for learning outcomes of motor skills and verbal infor-
</p>
<p>mation. Possible pedagogical strategies include drill and practice, part-task training,

<p>tutorial, games, lecture, and so on. For motor skill learning, possible strategies
</p>
<p>include hands-on experiences with real and simulated artifacts and interacting with
</p>
<p>simulations and virtual realities.
</p>
<p>Inductive Thinking
</p>
<p>The inductive thinking model is an example of concept formation based on
</p>
<p>allowing students to infer a general rule or patterns based on multiple examples and
</p>
<p>non-examples; this approach was developed by Hilda Taba (1971; see http://www.
</p>
<p>csus.edu/indiv/m/mcvickerb/imet_sites/fundamentals/inductive/taba_handbook.htm).
</p>
<p>Learning how to classify is fundamental; consequently, students learn information
</p>
<p>and concepts through the activity of classifying. They also learn how to build
</p>
<p>conceptual understanding of content areas and how to build and test hypotheses
</p>
<p>based on classifications. Inductive thinking is a generic model, partly because
</p>
<p>classification is believed to be the basic higher-order thinking skill and further,
</p>
<p>because the model is applicable to knowledge from phonics to physics.
</p>
<p>Concept Attainment
</p>
<p>The concept attainment model facilitates the type of learning referred to as con-
</p>
<p>ceptual learning in contrast with the rote learning of factual information or of
</p>
<p>vocabulary. In practice, the model works as an inductive model designed to teach
</p>
<p>concept through the use of examples. Therefore, in addition to help the students in
</p>
<p>the attainment of a particular concept, the model enables them to become aware of
</p>
<p>the process of conceptualizing.
</p>
<p>Advance Organizers
</p>
<p>As Ausubel maintains, advance organizers are the primary means of enriching or
</p>
<p>strengthening the learner&rsquo;s cognitive structure and enhancing the possibilities of
</p>
<p>learning or retention of new knowledge or information. Ausubel describes advance
</p>
<p>organizers as introductory materials or activities presented ahead of the learning
</p>
<p>task and at a higher level of abstraction and inclusiveness than the learning task
</p>
<p>itself. Their purpose is to explain, integrate and interrelate the material in the
</p>
<p>learning task with the previously learned material (Ausubel, 1968). Advance
</p>
<p>organizers increase the ability to absorb information and organize it, especially
</p>
<p>when learning from lectures and readings. Possible uses include learning cognitive
</p>
<p>strategies and intellectual skills (e.g., discrimination tasks, learning concepts,
</p>
<p>engaging in exploratory learning and simulations). Socratic questioning can be a
</p>
<p>form of an advance organizer. Possible technologies are management flight simu-
</p>
<p>lators, interactive simulations, and puzzles (Suchman&rsquo;s, 1964), an inquiry training
</p>
<p>system, or intelligent tutoring system, among others.
</p>
<p>Group Investigation
</p>
<p>Group investigation is a pedagogical approach that allows a class to work actively
</p>
<p>and collaboratively in small groups and enables students to take an active role in
</p>
<p>determining their own learning goals and processes. Examples for group investi-
</p>
<p>gation are observing the behavior of insects in groups, discovering the motion
</p>
<p>curve of an asteroid within a scientific team (Sharan &amp; Sharan, 1990). Small group
</p>
<p>investigations are often used in problem-based medical training.

<p>Classroom Meeting Strategy
</p>
<p>The classroom meeting model is a multipurpose approach for classroom manage-
</p>
<p>ment by setting aside time for students to discuss classroom issues as a
</p>
<p>group. Examples of a classroom meeting model are holding class meetings to
</p>
<p>involve students in addressing question like &ldquo;How should cheating be handled?&rdquo; or
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do about teasing and bullying in our school?&rdquo; (Class Meetings&mdash;
</p>
<p>TeacherVision, n.d.). While classroom instruction has been much criticized, it has a
</p>
<p>wide range of applicability.
</p>
<p>Project-Based Learning Approach
</p>
<p>Project-based learning is a pedagogical approach that encourages active learning
</p>
<p>within the constraints set by the teacher. Within this framework, students pursue
</p>
<p>solutions to non-trivial problems by asking and refining questions, debating ideas,
</p>
<p>making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing
</p>
<p>data, drawing conclusions, communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking
</p>
<p>new questions, and creating artifacts. With the support of today&rsquo;s technology,
</p>
<p>project-based learning is making a strong comeback in the classroom. Throughout
</p>
<p>the process, students use digital tools for gathering information and multimedia to
</p>
<p>create learning artifacts. They are guided by what they think the end result of their
</p>
<p>project should be. The teacher coaches the team to keep students on task and keep
</p>
<p>their work productive while students develop self-management and collaboration
</p>
<p>skills. By providing peer feedback on the content and demonstrating respect for
</p>
<p>their own findings, more substantive content is learned. The end product of each
</p>
<p>team is often presented to the whole class, demonstrating their understanding of
</p>
<p>what they learned.
</p>
<p>Inquiry-Based Learning Approach
</p>
<p>Inquiry-based learning approach is a method with which students learn knowledge
</p>
<p>driven by specific questions or a complex problem. The teacher scaffolds and helps
</p>
<p>students as they make contributions, identify questions, and gather relevant data on
</p>
<p>the Web. The setting of the problem is crucial during this process.
</p>
<p>Collaborative inquiry holds process similarities with project-based learning
</p>
<p>although it is distinctive in its focus on a driving question, or a complex problem,
</p>
<p>with respect to which students gather data for later analysis. In inquiry-based
</p>
<p>learning, the setting of the problem is as important as, if not more important than,
</p>
<p>finding solutions. The teacher scaffolds and helps students as they make contri-
</p>
<p>butions, identify questions, and gather relevant data on the Web. With mobile
</p>
<p>technologies, data from the field become more easily accessible with analytic tools
</p>
<p>to make sense of what has been gathered.
</p>
<p>Possible technologies to support the constructivist approach include toolkits and
</p>
<p>other support systems. Access to resources and expertise offers the potential to
</p>
<p>develop engaging, student-centered, active and authentic learning environments;
</p>
<p>Microworlds and simulations are likely technologies.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Collaborative Learning
</p>
<p>Collaborative learning is broadly defined as a situation in which two or more people
</p>
<p>attempt to learn together (Dillenbourg, 1999) or to accomplish shared goals
</p>
<p>(Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1986). Characteristics of effective collaborative learning
</p>
<p>include positive interdependence among members, group and individual account-
</p>
<p>ability, interpersonal skills, the ability to self-monitor, ensure consistent progress,
</p>
<p>and discontinue patterns of behavior that impede the progress (Johnson &amp; Johnson,
</p>
<p>1986). Collaborative learning is a situation in which two or more people learn or
</p>
<p>attempt to learn something together. Examples for collaborative learning are parents
</p>
<p>completing a task with their kids, participating in community economic activities
</p>
<p>(Collaborative Learning, 2017). Small groups of 3 to 5 learners are often effective,
</p>
<p>and on occasion, roles may rotate among the members of a group to ensure that
</p>
<p>everyone learns all aspects of the task (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1996).
</p>
<p>Collaborative Knowledge Building
</p>
<p>Collaborative knowledge building focuses on problems and depth of understanding;
</p>
<p>it takes steps of the creation, testing, and improvement of conceptual artifacts in
</p>
<p>groups. Knowledge building represents an attempt to refashion education in a
</p>
<p>fundamental way, so that it becomes a coherent effort to initiate students into a
</p>
<p>knowledge creating culture. Accordingly, it involves students not only developing
</p>
<p>knowledge building competencies but also students coming to see themselves and
</p>
<p>their work as part of the civilization-wide effort to advance knowledge frontiers. In
</p>
<p>this context, the Internet becomes more than a desktop library and a rapid mail
</p>
<p>delivery system. It becomes the first realistic means for students to connect with
</p>
<p>civilization-wide knowledge building and to make their classroom work a part of it
</p>
<p>(Sardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 2014). Examples of knowledge building are group dis-
</p>
<p>cussions, interactive questioning, dialogue, and so on.
</p>
<p>3.3 Types of Technology for Educational Uses
</p>
<p>Technology
</p>
<p>According to Rogers (1995), a technology is a design for instrumental action that
</p>
<p>reduces the uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a
</p>
<p>desired outcome. Others define a technology as a systematic application of
</p>
<p>knowledge to solve a problem valued by a group or society. In both cases, the aim
</p>
<p>of a technology is to achieve a desired outcome.
</p>
<p>A technology may have two components: (1) a hardware aspect, consisting of
</p>
<p>the tool that embodies the technology as a material or physical object, and (2) a
</p>
<p>software aspect, consisting of the information base for the tool. Some technologies
</p>
<p>lack one or both of these components and may simply consist of a standard pro-
</p>
<p>cedure or general purpose algorithmic approach.

<p>Educational Technology
</p>
<p>Educational technology is not a homogeneous intervention but refers to a broad
</p>
<p>variety of modalities, tools, and strategies for learning. Its effectiveness, therefore,
</p>
<p>depends on how well it helps teachers and students achieve the desired instructional
</p>
<p>goals (Bruce &amp; Levin, 1997).
</p>
<p>Bruce &amp; Levin (1997) describe a new way of classifying uses of educational
</p>
<p>technologies, based on a four-part division suggested years ago by John Dewey
</p>
<p>(1938): inquiry, communication, construction, and expression. Each of these is
</p>

<p>3.4 Principles for the Selection of Technology
for Educational Uses
</p>
<p>Mayer (2009) has proposed some principles of multimedia learning which can also
</p>
<p>be used for guiding the selection of technology for educational uses. The principles
</p>
<p>are as follows:
</p>
<p>(1) Principle of Appropriateness
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology should promote the general and specific goals of the class.
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology should be appropriate to the intended level, including vocab-
</p>
<p>ulary level, difficulty of concepts, methods of development, interest appeal.
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology should be either basic or supplementary to the curriculum.
</p>
<p>(2) Principle of Authenticity
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology should present accurate, up to date, and dependable
</p>
<p>information.
</p>
<p>(3) Principle of Cost
</p>
<p>&bull; Substitutes and trade-offs of alternative solutions should be considered.
</p>
<p>(4) Principle of Interest
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology should catch the interest of the learners, must stimulate
</p>
<p>curiosity, or satisfy the learner&rsquo;s need to know.
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology should have the power to motivate, encourage creativity, and
</p>
<p>imaginative response among users.
</p>
<p>60 3 Linking Learning Objectives, Pedagogies, and Technologies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(5) Principle of Organization and Balance
</p>
<p>&bull; Technology should be well organized and well balanced in content.
</p>
<p>&bull; Purpose of the material should be clearly stated or perceived.
</p>
<p>&bull; There should be logical organization, clarity, and accordance with the
</p>
<p>principles of learning such as reinforcement, transfer, and application in the
</p>
<p>materials.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) The kinds of instructional strategies that should be selected depend on learning
</p>
<p>objectives and learning domains; the technologies should be aligned with
</p>
<p>instructional strategies.
</p>
<p>(2) In order to achieve the learning objectives, learners engage in learning
</p>
<p>activities, such as inquiry, communication, construction, and knowledge
</p>
<p>representation. Types of learning and pedagogies should be considered when
</p>
<p>selecting appropriate technologies.
</p>
<p>(3) Pedagogical approaches relevant to the selection of technologies include
</p>
<p>practice and feedback approaches, representational approaches, collaboration
</p>
<p>approaches, project-based approaches, inquiry-based approaches, and informal
</p>
<p>and autonomous learning approaches.
</p>
<p>(4) The principles for the selection of technology educational uses include the
</p>
<p>principle of appropriateness, the principle of authenticity, the principle of cost,
</p>
<p>the principle of interest, and the principle of organization and balance.

<p>4. Create a concept map depicting an educational technology system that involves
</p>
<p>designing, developing, and deploying a system to support secondary school
</p>
<p>teachers in creating interactive games for specific learning goals in various
</p>
<p>science subjects. You can assume others are responsible for the design and

<p>development. Your task is to depict the larger context in which such a system is
</p>
<p>likely to be used. Be sure to indicate the major components of the system and
</p>
<p>the dynamic interactions likely to occur over time. The concept map should be
</p>

</p>
<p>4.1 Introduction to Systems
</p>
<p>Austrian biologist Ludwig Von Bertalanffy (1901&ndash;1972) is known as one of the
</p>
<p>founders of general system theory that was published in 1968. According to Ber-
</p>
<p>talanffy, a system is defined as a set of elements standing in interrelation among
</p>
<p>themselves and within an environment (Bertalanffy, 1968). Peter Michael Senge
</p>
<p>(born 1947) is an American system scientist and the founder of the Society for
</p>
<p>Organizational Learning. Senge is known as the author of the book The Fifth
</p>
<p>Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization, which focuses on
</p>
<p>group problem solving using the system-thinking methods in order to convert
</p>
<p>companies into learning organizations.
</p>
<p>Systems are pervasive in the natural world (e.g., the solar system, the nervous
</p>
<p>system, various ecological systems, etc.) as well as in things created by people (e.g.,
</p>
<p>a governmental system, a school system, a library system, etc.). In short, we live in
</p>
<p>and interact with systems every day in many different ways. The focus of this
</p>
<p>chapter is on systems involving education and technology, of which there are many
</p>
<p>and likely to be many more in the future.
</p>
<p>A system is a combination of more than two interacting and interconnected
</p>
<p>elements which function as an organic or integrated or coordinated whole. There are
</p>
<p>three main aspects of a system (Huang, Sha, &amp; Peng, 2006):
</p>
<p>(1) A system consists of two or more elements. Systems are pervasive. Many
</p>
<p>objects and processes involve systems.
</p>
<p>(2) A system is more than a collection of elements and includes how the elements
</p>
<p>are connected and how they interact over time. Systems change over time.
</p>
<p>Change and development of each system occurs in the exchange of material,
</p>
<p>energy, and information, which can benefit the dynamic stability and openness
</p>
<p>of these systems simultaneously.
</p>
<p>(3) A system is a kind of bounded whole that is situated in a particular envi-
</p>
<p>ronment or context, with input coming from the environment and outputs
</p>
<p>going back to the environment. Systems exist in an environment. Each system

<p>accompanied by its surrounding can generate a larger/broader system, and
</p>
<p>those parts contained in the original system can be regarded as the subsystem
</p>
<p>of the new one.
</p>
<p>Elements of a System
</p>
<p>A system can be described in terms of five basic elements (Fig. 4.1): (1) the various
</p>
<p>components comprising a system (A, B, C, D in Fig. 4.1); (2) interactions among
</p>
<p>the components of a system; (3) the environment in which the system exists;
</p>
<p>(4) inputs from the environment to the system; (5) outputs from the system to the
</p>
<p>environment (Mangal &amp; Mangal, 2009).
</p>
<p>In general system theory, a system is any collection of interrelated parts that
</p>
<p>together constitute a larger whole. These component parts or elements of the system
</p>
<p>are intimately linked with one another, either directly or indirectly, and any change
</p>
<p>in one or more elements may affect the overall performance of the system, either
</p>
<p>beneficially or adversely.
</p>
<p>Examples of a System
</p>
<p>Solar system and the human body system are the typical examples of a system.
</p>
<p>(1) The solar system is made up of the sun and eight planets (Mercury, Venus,
</p>
<p>Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) along with smaller planetary
</p>
<p>objects; the solar system includes the mutual interactions among these elements
</p>
<p>(e.g., gravitational influence), their orbits, as well as influences from the milky way
</p>
<p>galaxy which is the environment in which the solar system exists.
</p>
<p>(2) The human body is comprised of several systems, including the nervous
</p>
<p>system, the skeletal system, the endocrine system, the exocrine system, the blood
</p>
<p>circulatory system, the respiratory system, the digestive system, the urinary system,
</p>
<p>and the reproductive system. These systems coordinate with each other to carry out
</p>
<p>their different physiological functions. The human body exists in an environment

</p>
<p>are outputs from the human body to the environment as well.
</p>
<p>4.2 Education Systems
</p>
<p>Roger Kaufman (1972) was one of the first to apply a systems approach to edu-
</p>
<p>cation. An education system is a man-made system and can be considered as a
</p>
<p>subsystem of the society in which it exists. One might think of an education system
</p>
<p>as taking inputs from the society (e.g., students) and providing outputs to society
</p>
<p>(e.g., graduates). Moreover, an education system could be conceptualized as a
</p>
<p>collection of subsystems, such as a school system, a curricular system, a grading
</p>
<p>system, and so on.
</p>
<p>Elements of an Education System
</p>
<p>According to the characteristics of the system, the education system can be cate-
</p>
<p>gorized to different levels: (1) macro-level: state, social education system;
</p>
<p>(2) meso-level: community and school education system; (3) micro-level: teaching
</p>
<p>process, learning process, media development, and other education system. The
</p>
<p>school system may be treated as a subsystem of the education system or a system
</p>
<p>complete in itself (Mangal &amp; Mangal, 2009). In this chapter, we mainly focus on
</p>
<p>the school education system at the meso-level, and the structure of the education
</p>
<p>system is shown in Fig. 4.2.
</p>
<p>An education system includes four kinds of elements: (1) inputs: pupils,
</p>
<p>administration, teachers, material for formal or informal education; (2) processes:
</p>
<p>formal or informal education process; (3) outputs: people who have attained
</p>
<p>educational objectives, such as grades and abilities; (4) and an environment: formal
</p>
<p>learning venues (e.g., schools) and informal learning venues (e.g., home, caf&eacute;, etc.).
</p>
<p>In addition, the system consists of interactions among these elements.
</p>
<p>An instructional system is a subsystem within an education system, although one
</p>
<p>can describe elements and interactions relevant to an instructional system (e.g.,
</p>
<p>resources, assessments, instructors, students, scaffolding, etc.). One can also

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>consider a curriculum as a subsystem within the larger instructional system. In
</p>
<p>short, one can elaborate an education system in terms of subsystems.
</p>
<p>Principles for an Education System
</p>
<p>(1) Overall principle
</p>
<p>A system should be effective in fulfilling its purpose. An instructional system
</p>
<p>should have integrity, in the sense of being reliably effective; this is the essential
</p>
<p>characteristic of a system and the core of system theory. A system is composed of
</p>
<p>elements within an environment and should interact in a way that fulfills the
</p>
<p>purpose of the system. The overall principle of an education system requires
</p>
<p>coordinating the relationships among teachers, learners, and resources.
</p>
<p>(2) Feedback principle
</p>
<p>A system should be stable. From a system dynamics point of view, there are two
</p>
<p>kinds of feedback mechanisms within a system&mdash;positive or reinforcing feedback
</p>
<p>and negative or balancing feedback (Spector, 2015). As an example, the moon is
</p>
<p>orbiting the earth at a speed of more than 3600 km an hour. At that speed, it would
</p>
<p>keep going into outer space and not return each day; in this case, one can say that
</p>
<p>gravitational attraction of the earth on the moon serves as a balancing mechanism or
</p>
<p>a kind of negative feedback control that keeps the system stable and the moon in
</p>
<p>orbit around the earth.
</p>
<p>The feedback principle tells us that an instructional system also has feedback
</p>
<p>mechanisms. One can think of assessments as a kind of balancing mechanism that
</p>
<p>helps to keep an instructional system stable. If all students simply attended and then
</p>
<p>left without any kind of assessment (neither formative nor summative), the system
</p>
<p>would become unstable and unable to attain its intended purpose of helping stu-
</p>
<p>dents develop knowledge and master skills. If all that matter in an instructional
</p>
<p>system are the number of participants without any consideration of learning, then
</p>
<p>the system is unlikely to fulfill its instructional purpose. Some have criticized early
</p>
<p>massive open online courses (MOOCs) for this very reason.
</p>
<p>(3) Order principle
</p>
<p>Order refers to the nature and structural functions of a system. Systems can be
</p>
<p>categorized along a simple-to-complex scale. Systems can also be categorized along
</p>
<p>a disordered-to-ordered scale. Given the prior mention of thinking about an edu-
</p>
<p>cation system as a collection of subsystems, one can then categorize the subsystems
</p>
<p>as progressing along these two scales (simple-to-complex, and disordered-
</p>
<p>to-ordered).
</p>
<p>Typically, an education system will have complex but ordered subsystems. One
</p>
<p>might argue that if one thinks in terms of grade-level educational subsystems, they
</p>
<p>do progress from simple and relatively disordered at an elementary level to a more
</p>
<p>complex and more ordered level as one proceeds to a secondary and tertiary level.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Educational Technology from a System&rsquo;s Perspective
</p>
<p>Educational technology is an area that uses systematic methods to analyze educa-
</p>
<p>tional problems, design and develop instructional systems to support learning.
</p>
<p>A system&rsquo;s perspective views the various elements and interactions in a systemic
</p>
<p>manner, functioning in a well-ordered manner just as a healthy human body with its
</p>
<p>various subsystems functioning in a well-ordered manner. In addition to that sys-
</p>
<p>temic perspective, instructional designers and educational technologists typically
</p>
<p>employ systematic methods and processes to ensure that stable instructional systems
</p>
<p>result. This systemic view and the associated systematic methods and processes have
</p>
<p>evolved over time, as indicated in the brief overview of recent educational tech-
</p>
<p>nology history (see Spector &amp; Ren, 2015, for a more comprehensive treatment).
</p>
<p>4.3.1 Five Stages of Educational Technology
</p>
<p>Educational technologies have evolved from simple texts to highly complex and
</p>
<p>interactive digital systems. Table 4.1 depicts a simplified view of that development.
</p>
<p>The important point here is that education systems have become very complex,
</p>
<p>which results in the increasing challenges in designing, developing, implementing,
</p>
<p>and supporting these systems.
</p>
<p>4.3.2 Typical Educational Technology Systems
</p>
<p>With the use of technology in education system, the educational technology sys-
</p>
<p>tems are changing rapidly. The typical educational technology systems developed

<p>from CAI, ICAI to ITS, with personalized and adaptive learning are more and more
</p>
<p>emphasized.
</p>
<p>4.3.2.1 Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI)
The formation of CAI is influenced by machine teaching and program teaching. It
</p>
<p>was first used in education and training during the 1950s, such as PLATO (Pro-
</p>
<p>grammed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations; see https://chip.web.ischool.
</p>
<p>illinois.edu/people/projects/timeline/1960won.html). Early work was done at IBM
</p>
<p>and other mainframe computer companies and by Gordon Pask, O.M. Moore, and
</p>
<p>others, but CAI grew rapidly in the 1960s when federal funding for research and
</p>
<p>development in education and industrial laboratories was implemented. (See http://
</p>
<p>cehdclass.gmu.edu/ndabbagh/Resources/IDKB/models.htm)
</p>
<p>CAI is a method of instruction in which there is a purposeful interaction between
</p>
<p>a learner and the computer device (having useful instructional material as software)
</p>
<p>for helping the individual learner achieve the desired instructional objectives with
</p>
<p>his own pace and abilities at his command (Mangal &amp; Mangal, 2009). It stands for
</p>
<p>the type of instruction aided or carried out with the help of a computer as a teaching
</p>
<p>machine.
</p>
<p>CAI is characterized as one-to-one interaction between a computer system and a
</p>
<p>student; the system elicits responses from a student and provides feedback, and
</p>
<p>allowing students to proceed at their own pace. (See https://www.britannica.com/
</p>
<p>topic/computer-assisted-instruction). Yet, CAI also has some limitations and
</p>
<p>drawbacks: (1) simple man-machine conversation; (2) passive acceptance of
</p>
<p>knowledge; (3) single learning style; (4) the stable studying procedure.
</p>
<p>Extended Reading
</p>
<p>TICCIT (Time-Shared Interactive Computer Controlled Information Televi-
</p>
<p>sion) is another major CAI system developed at the University of Texas and
</p>
<p>Brigham Young University and funded by a grant from the National Science
</p>
<p>Foundation in 1977.
</p>
<p>In December, 1971, the National Science Foundation (NSF) Technological
</p>
<p>Innovations Group granted a contract to MITRE to further develop the
</p>
<p>TICCIT system as a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system for com-
</p>
<p>munity colleges. MITRE subcontracted with the CAI Laboratory at the
</p>
<p>University of Texas at Austin and also with the Department of Instructional
</p>
<p>Research, Development, and Evaluation of Brigham Young University to
</p>
<p>refine the user interface and create the massive amounts of courseware needed
</p>
<p>to teach a complete college-level English and algebra course. A trial imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of the English and algebra courseware took place through the
</p>
<p>1975&ndash;77 school years, and was evaluated by the Educational Testing Service
</p>
<p>(ETS).

<p>4.3.2.2 Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction
In the traditional CAI, the computer is only used as the disseminator of knowledge,
</p>
<p>but it does not understand the knowledge that it teaches; moreover, it does not
</p>
<p>understand the students beyond a simple parsing of text-based responses. With the
</p>
<p>development and maturation of artificial intelligence, AI technology is used in more
</p>
<p>sophisticated CAI system so that the CAI system can understand what to teach, how
</p>
<p>to teach, and how a student is progressing, which leads to the emergence of the
</p>
<p>intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI). ICAI is a kind of application mode
</p>
<p>of CAI, which is based on artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and thinking
</p>
<p>sciences. ICAI constructs a simple cognitive model of learners using established
</p>
<p>characteristics and processes of human thinking. Through an ICAI system, students
</p>
<p>can acquire knowledge through individualized adaptive learning.
</p>
<p>ICAI changes the traditional teaching mode. The students get feedback infor-
</p>
<p>mation in real time through human&ndash;computer interaction, adjusting the learning
</p>
<p>pace actively. The whole teaching process is shifted from teacher-centered to
</p>
<p>student-centered. In 1970, the first influential ICAI system was the scholar system
</p>
<p>that taught South American geography, creating a precedent for ICAI research.
</p>
<p>An ICAI system has a computer program that uses artificial intelligence tech-
</p>
<p>niques (e.g., a production model, backward chaining, and other means) for repre-
</p>
<p>senting knowledge and performing an interaction with a student to stimulate and
</p>
<p>control his learning in a given field. In an intelligent instructional system, the
</p>
<p>student is actively engaged with the educational environment and his interests and
</p>
<p>misunderstandings drive the tutorial dialogue (Bottino &amp; Molfino, 1985).
</p>
<p>It must be pointed out, however, that from an educational point of view, ICAI
</p>
<p>systems are not only expert systems, but they must also embody suitable models
</p>
<p>both for the student&rsquo;s behavior and for the teaching methodology (Bottino &amp;
</p>
<p>Molfino, 1985).
</p>
<p>Extended Reading
</p>
<p>One of the earliest ICAI systems was SCHOLAR, which is a system designed
</p>
<p>to teach South American geography. The program uses a network of faces and
</p>
<p>concepts as well as an extensive data base. The original system allowed the
</p>
<p>student to conduct a &ldquo;mixed initiative&rdquo; dialogue. Allowing SCHOLAR to ask
</p>
<p>the student questions and then, with a limited natural language interface.
</p>
<p>Permitting the student to ask questions of the system. This kind of interaction
</p>
<p>highlights SCHOLAR&rsquo;s most advanced qualities: the tutoring component and
</p>
<p>a limited communication module. These two features enable the student to
</p>
<p>interact with SCHOLAR.

<p>4.3.2.3 Intelligent Tutoring System
The innovative feature of ICAI was to support individualized learning for students.
</p>
<p>Intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is a typical instance of an ICAI system. ICAI and
</p>
<p>ITS are often used interchangeably.
</p>
<p>An ITS is a computer system that aims to provide immediate and customized
</p>
<p>instruction or feedback to learners (Psotka, Massey, &amp; Mutter, 1988), usually
</p>
<p>without requiring intervention from a human teacher. It can assist students in
</p>
<p>studying a variety of subjects by posing questions, parsing responses, and offering
</p>
<p>customized instruction and feedback. During the rapid expansion of the web boom,
</p>
<p>new computer-aided instruction paradigms, such as e-learning and distributed
</p>
<p>learning, provided an excellent platform for ITS ideas.
</p>
<p>The ITS is the typical educational technology system, including four technology
</p>
<p>components: (1) domain model, (2) learner model, (3) pedagogical model, and
</p>
<p>(4) interaction model. Figure 4.3 presents a typical ITS architecture.
</p>
<p>(1) Domain Model
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;domain&rdquo; means a specific field or scope of knowledge, such as algebra,
</p>
<p>critical thinking, and psychology. People who have a deep understanding of a
</p>
<p>domain are called domain experts. A domain model represents domain experts&rsquo;
</p>
<p>ideas, skills, and the way that they solve domain problems. A good domain model
</p>
<p>provides a structure to minimize domain experts&rsquo; authoring time and maximize the
</p>
<p>quality of the content (Robert et al., 2013).
</p>
<p>The domain model contains the set of skills, knowledge, and strategies of the
</p>
<p>topic being tutored. It normally contains the ideal expert knowledge and also the
</p>
<p>bugs, mal-rules, and misconceptions that students periodically exhibit (Robert et al.,
</p>
<p>2013). The domain model consists of the concepts, facts, rules, and problem-
</p>
<p>solving strategies of the domain in context. It serves as a source of expert
</p>
<p>knowledge, a standard for evaluation of the student&rsquo;s performance and diagnosis of
</p>
<p>errors (Ahuja &amp; Sille, 2013).
</p>
<p>(2) Learner Model
</p>
<p>We simply need to record, represent, and track characteristics of the learner before,
</p>
<p>during, and after learning. The practical problem is that it is expensive to identify,
</p>
<p>track, store, update, and later retrieve the ever-growing universal set of variables.
</p>

</p>
<p>4.3 Educational Technology from a System&rsquo;s Perspective 73</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The mapping problem is that the alignment between the theoretical variables and
</p>
<p>computer code is often vague, incomplete, or incompatible.
</p>
<p>Learner modeling is the cornerstone of personalized learning. The learner model
</p>
<p>is a representation of the system&rsquo;s assessment of an individual learner&rsquo;s current
</p>
<p>knowledge, including misconceptions, learning styles, personality traits, and
</p>
<p>affective states. The system infers this information from interactions between the
</p>
<p>system and the learner (Spector, 2015).
</p>
<p>The learner model consists of the cognitive, affective, motivational, and other
</p>
<p>psychological states that evolves during the course of learning. The learner model is
</p>
<p>often viewed as an overlay of the domain model, which changes over the course of
</p>
<p>tutoring. For example, knowledge tracing tracks the learner&rsquo;s progress from
</p>
<p>problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the
</p>
<p>domain model (Robert et al., 2013).
</p>
<p>(3) Pedagogical Model
</p>
<p>The pedagogical model selects appropriate strategies and activities to promote
</p>
<p>successful learning given the progress of a particular learner and the associated
</p>
<p>information stored in the learner model (Spector, 2015).
</p>
<p>The pedagogical model accepts information from the domain models and student
</p>
<p>models and devices tutoring strategies with actions. This model regulates instruc-
</p>
<p>tional interactions with students. Pedagogical model is closely linked to the student
</p>
<p>model, which makes use of knowledge about the student and its own tutorial goal
</p>
<p>structure, to devise the pedagogic activity to be presented. It tracks the learner&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>progress, builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production
</p>
<p>rules (Ahuja &amp; Sille, 2013).
</p>
<p>The pedagogical model takes the domain models and learner models as input and
</p>
<p>select tutoring strategies, steps, and actions on what the tutor should do next in the
</p>
<p>exchange, in mixed-initiative systems, the learners may also take actions, ask
</p>
<p>questions, or request help (Aleven et al., 2006). The pedagogical model always
</p>
<p>needs to be ready to decide &ldquo;what to do next&rdquo; at any point and this is determined by
</p>
<p>a pedagogical model that captures the researcher&rsquo;s pedagogical theories.
</p>
<p>(4) Interface Model
</p>
<p>The interface model decides how to interpret user input and then how to give
</p>
<p>appropriate responses. This requires both specific domain knowledge and some
</p>
<p>commonsense knowledge about the world. The learner and system interaction is
</p>
<p>traditionally expressed by typed or spoken texts, and recently by multimodal
</p>
<p>interactions through mouse clicks, screen touches, facial expressions, eye move-
</p>
<p>ments, and gestures (Spector, 2015).
</p>
<p>User interface model is the interacting front end of the ITS. It integrates all types
</p>
<p>of information needed to interact with learner, through graphics, text, multimedia,
</p>
<p>keyboard, mouse-driven menus, etc. Prime factors for user acceptance are
</p>
<p>user-friendliness and presentation (Ahuja &amp; Sille, 2013).
</p>
<p>The user interface interprets the learner&rsquo;s contribution through various input
</p>
<p>media (speech, typing, clicking) and produces output in different media (text,
</p>
<p>diagrams, animations, agents). In addition to the conventional human&ndash;computer
</p>
<p>74 4 Systems Perspective of Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interface features, some recent systems have incorporated natural language inter-
</p>
<p>action, speech recognition, and the sensing of learner emotions (Robert et al.,
</p>
<p>2013).
</p>
<p>Extended Reading
</p>
<p>Here is an example of an interaction model involving Microsoft products that
</p>
<p>most have probably used. In Microsoft Word, the interaction model supports
</p>
<p>the conceptual model of users&rsquo; putting a piece of paper into a typewriter and
</p>
<p>typing. It also happens to have a lot of features that enable users to format a
</p>
<p>page and content in almost any way they can imagine. But that interaction
</p>
<p>model sits at its core. With Microsoft Excel, the interaction model reflects the
</p>
<p>conceptual model of accountants&rsquo; working with accounts in ledgers that
</p>
<p>contain rows of entries and columns of numbers and show a balance. Excel
</p>
<p>has additional features that make it a much richer experience than creating a
</p>
<p>spreadsheet on paper. But at its core is an interaction model that all users can
</p>
<p>internalize quickly. The interaction model for Microsoft PowerPoint reflects
</p>
<p>the conceptual model of users&rsquo; writing on a sheet of transparent plastic, then
</p>
<p>placing it on an overhead projector&mdash;for those of us who are old enough to
</p>
<p>have actually seen this! The interaction model for each of these products is
</p>
<p>very different, yet each, in itself, is very clear.
</p>
<p>The Typical Example of ITS
</p>
<p>AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system developed by researchers at the Institute
</p>
<p>for Intelligent Systems at the University of Memphis in 1997. The goal was to help
</p>
<p>students learn physics, computer literacy, and critical thinking using an intelligent
</p>
<p>tutorial (Graesser, Chipman, Haynes, &amp; Olney, 2005).
</p>
<p>AutoTutor is a computer tutor that helps students learn by holding a conversation
</p>
<p>in natural language (AutoTutor, 2018). It has produced learning gains across
</p>
<p>multiple domains (e.g., computer literacy, physics, critical thinking). Three main
</p>
<p>research areas of AutoTutor are: human-inspired tutoring strategies, pedagogical
</p>
<p>agents, and technology that supports natural language tutoring.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) A system is defined as a set of elements standing in interrelation among
</p>
<p>themselves and within an environment.
</p>
<p>(2) A system can be described in terms of five basic elements: the various com-
</p>
<p>ponents comprising a system; interactions among the components of a system;
</p>
<p>the environment in which the system exists; inputs from the environment to
</p>
<p>the system; outputs from the system to the environment.
</p>
<p>(3) An education system includes four elements of inputs, process, output, and
</p>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p>4.3 Educational Technology from a System&rsquo;s Perspective 75</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(4) The educational technology has gone through five stages: intuitive instruction,
</p>
<p>visual instruction, audiovisual instruction, audiovisual communication, and
</p>
<p>information and communication technologies.
</p>
<p>(5) The typical educational technology systems include CAI, ICAI, and ITS.

</p>
<p>5.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The previous chapter discussed a systems&rsquo; perspective of educational technology.
</p>
<p>Educational technology can be regarded as a system with a variety of components
</p>
<p>and relationships. As we know, educational technology systems aim at improving
</p>
<p>user&rsquo;s performance, and users could include students, teachers, parents, support
</p>
<p>personnel, administrators, and policy makers. Different users may have different
</p>
<p>perspectives and concerns, and thus user&rsquo;s perspectives play a vital role for the
</p>
<p>success of educational technology systems.
</p>
<p>In software engineering, user-centered design and development are now standard
</p>
<p>practice with an emphasis on rapid prototyping and getting input from represen-
</p>
<p>tative users. Taking the typical models of user-centered design in software engi-
</p>
<p>neering as a reference and considering the research of user-centered design in
</p>
<p>educational technology, the following sections will introduce the users&rsquo; perspective
</p>
<p>of educational technology. Emphasis is on user experience, user-centered design,
</p>
<p>learner-centered design, and the ARCS motivation model.
</p>
<p>5.2 User Experience
</p>
<p>Definition
</p>
<p>User experience (UX) is defined as &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s perceptions and responses that result
</p>
<p>from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service&rdquo; (International
</p>
<p>Organization for Standardization, 2009). From to this definition, UX includes all
</p>
<p>the users&rsquo; attitudes, emotions, perceptions, preferences, physical/psychological
</p>
<p>responses, and behaviors that occur before, during, and after use. The ISO also lists
</p>
<p>three factors that influence user experience: system, user, and the context of use.
</p>
<p>78 5 Users Perspective of Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>User Experience Honeycomb
</p>
<p>Morville (2004) created a frequently reproduced honeycomb model to design for
</p>
<p>user experience that illustrated the facets of user experience (see Fig. 5.1), espe-
</p>
<p>cially to help clients understand why they must move beyond usability.
</p>
<p>The user experience honeycomb could be used as a guide to explain the various
</p>
<p>facets of the design of user experience. Morville (2004) believed that the user
</p>
<p>experience honeycomb would contribute to educating clients, which helps them to
</p>
<p>find a sweet spot between the various areas of a good user experience. If applied in
</p>
<p>educational technology, the essential items could be explained as follow:
</p>
<p>Useful. An educational technology product or service should fulfill teachers&rsquo;/
</p>
<p>students&rsquo;/parents&rsquo; needs. If the product or service could not fulfill user&rsquo;s wants
</p>
<p>or needs, then there is no real use for the product itself.
</p>
<p>Usable. Systems in which the product or service is delivered should be simple,
</p>
<p>familiar, easy to understand and easy to use. The learning curve that users must
</p>
<p>go through should be as short and painless as possible.
</p>
<p>Desirable. The visual aesthetics of the educational product, service, or system
</p>
<p>should be minimal, attractive, and easy to understand. Our pursuit of efficiency
</p>
<p>must be moderated by an appreciation for the power and value of the brand,
</p>
<p>image, identity, and other elements of emotional design.
</p>
<p>Findable. Information in the educational technology systems needs to be findable
</p>
<p>and easy to navigate. If teachers/students/parents have a problem, they should be
</p>
<p>able to find a solution quickly. The navigational structure must be set up in a way
</p>
<p>that takes users&rsquo; behaviors and habits into consideration to makes sense.
</p>

<p>Accessible. The product or services should be designed so that even users with
</p>
<p>disabilities can have the same user experience as others.
</p>
<p>Credible. The enterprises and their products or services need to be trustworthy.
</p>
<p>Valuable. Our products or services should deliver value to sponsors. For
</p>
<p>nonprofits, the user experience must improve the mission of the enterprise. With
</p>
<p>for-profits, it should contribute to the bottom line and increase customer
</p>
<p>satisfaction.
</p>
<p>Take a Web site design as an example. The content should be original and fulfill
</p>
<p>some users&rsquo; needs (useful). The site must be easy to use (usable). The design

<p>elements (like the brand) are used to evoke emotion and appreciation (desirable).
</p>
<p>The content needs to be navigable (findable), and they should be available even to
</p>
<p>people with disabilities (accessible). Users must trust the content and the brand
</p>
<p>(credible).
</p>
<p>The honeycomb model helps to find all the areas that are essential to a good user
</p>
<p>experience and can be broken down into more specific aspects. As an educational
</p>
<p>technology system/product designer, we could use the honeycomb model to outline
</p>
<p>and define all the areas that are relevant to user experience (UX) design, and ask
</p>
<p>ourselves the following questions. Is it more important for our system to be find-
</p>
<p>able? Is it desirable to use? Which of those two concerns need to be addressed first?
</p>
<p>Do we need to improve credibility in our market? Is our product or service
</p>
<p>accessible? So on and so forth.
</p>
<p>5.3 User-Centered Design
</p>
<p>Definition
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;user-centered design (UCD)&rdquo; was used in the 1980s in Donald Norman&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>research laboratory at the University of California San Diego and became widely
</p>
<p>used after the publication of the book entitled: User-Centered System Design: New
</p>
<p>Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction (Norman &amp; Draper, 1986).
</p>
<p>Landauer (1995) defined UCD as &ldquo;design driven, informed, and shaped by
</p>
<p>empirical evaluation of usefulness and usability&rdquo; (p. 221). Later, Karat (1997)
</p>
<p>defined UCD as &ldquo;an iterative process whose goal is the development of usable
</p>
<p>system&hellip; achieve through the involvement of potential users of a system in system
</p>
<p>design. It captures a commitment that you must involve users in system design&rdquo;
</p>
<p>(p. 38).
</p>
<p>From the two definitions, we see that UCD is a broad term to refer to the design
</p>
<p>processes in which users influence how a design takes shape.
</p>
<p>User-Centered Design Process
</p>
<p>UCD is both a broad philosophy and a series of methods. Lots of techniques could
</p>
<p>be used to involve users in UCD, but the important concept is that end users should
</p>
<p>80 5 Users Perspective of Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>be involved one way or another in the design process. For instance, users may be
</p>
<p>consulted about their needs and be involved at different stages during the design
</p>
<p>process, such as the requirements gathering process or the usability testing process.
</p>
<p>In some types of UCD methods, users may have a deep impact on the
</p>
<p>system/product design by being involved throughout the design process.
</p>
<p>UCD is an iterative design process, whereby a prototype is designed, tested, and
</p>
<p>modified. The iterative process based upon the design cycle presented in the
</p>
<p>user-centered design draft standard ISO 13407 (see https://www.iso.org/standard/
</p>
<p>21197.html) was shown in Fig. 5.2. These days, this process is often called
</p>
<p>design-based research (see Chap. 11).
</p>
<p>In the process of planning UCD, the following four activities is the key to
</p>
<p>success.
</p>
<p>1. Understand and specify the context of use: Identify who will use our product,
</p>
<p>what is the purpose of using it, and in which conditions they will use it.
</p>
<p>2. Specify the user and organizational requirements: Identify any business mis-
</p>
<p>sions or end-user needs that must be met for our product to become successful.
</p>
<p>3. Produce design solutions: This step should be a spiraling process, building from
</p>
<p>a rough concept to a complete design.
</p>
<p>4. Evaluate designs against user requirements: The evaluation to see if our product
</p>
<p>meet user&rsquo;s needs&mdash;usually through usability testing with actual users&mdash;is as
</p>
<p>important as quality testing to good software development.
</p>
<p>User-Centered Design Principles
</p>
<p>In the above iterative process of UCD from ISO 13407, the following six principles
</p>
<p>should be considered by UCD managers.
</p>
<p>1. The design should be based on clear understanding of environments, users, and
</p>
<p>tasks.
</p>

<p>2. Users should be involved throughout the design and development process.
</p>
<p>3. The design should be driven user-centered evaluation and then refined by
</p>
<p>user-centered evaluation.
</p>
<p>4. The design process should be iterative.
</p>
<p>5. The design should address all the areas of user experience.
</p>
<p>6. The design team should include multi-disciplinary skills and perspectives.
</p>
<p>Norman (1988) proposed the following seven guiding principles of design to
</p>
<p>ensure useful and usable products.
</p>
<p>1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head. Build con-
</p>
<p>ceptual models based on research and investigation, write manuals before the
</p>
<p>design is implemented, and make sure the manuals are easily understood.
</p>
<p>2. Simplify the structure of tasks. Understand that users can only remember five
</p>
<p>things at a time on average and therefore not to overload their short-term
</p>
<p>memory. It is important to provide mental aids for easy retrieval of information
</p>
<p>from long-term memory. Make sure the user has control over the tasks, and the
</p>
<p>tasks should be consistent.
</p>
<p>3. Make things visible to facilitate execution and evaluation. The user should be
</p>
<p>able to figure out the use of an object by seeing the right buttons or devices for
</p>
<p>executing an operation.
</p>
<p>4. Make the connection of operations obvious. One way to make connections of
</p>
<p>functions understandable is to use graphics.
</p>
<p>5. Exploit the power of constraints. These can be both natural and artificial, and
</p>
<p>their use gives the user the feeling that there is one thing to do.
</p>
<p>6. Design for error. Plan for errors to be made by users; one way to do this is to
</p>
<p>provide allowed the option of quick and easy recovery from any possible error
</p>
<p>made.
</p>
<p>7. When all else fails, standardize. Create an international standard if something
</p>
<p>cannot be designed without arbitrary mappings (Norman, 1988).
</p>
<p>Norman&rsquo;s work stressed the need to fully investigate the desires and needs of the
</p>
<p>end users and the possible uses of the product. Users became a central part of the
</p>
<p>product development process. Their involvement will contribute to more effective,
</p>
<p>efficient, and safer products and lead to the acceptance and success of our products
</p>
<p>(Preece, Rogers, &amp; Sharp, 2002).
</p>
<p>Involve Users in the Design
</p>
<p>In order to involve users in the design, the first and most important task is to
</p>
<p>identify who is the user. Eason (1987) proposed three kinds of users: primary,
</p>
<p>secondary, and tertiary users. Primary users are those who actually use the product;
</p>
<p>secondary users are those who will occasionally use the product or those who use it
</p>
<p>through a mediator; tertiary users are those who will be affected by the utilization
</p>
<p>of the product or make decisions about its purchase. The successful design of a
</p>
<p>82 5 Users Perspective of Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>product must consider the wide range of stakeholders/users of the product. Not
</p>
<p>everyone who is a stakeholder needs to be represented in a design team, but the
</p>
<p>effect of the product on them must be taken into consideration (Preece et al., 2002).
</p>
<p>After the stakeholders have been identified, a thorough investigation of their
</p>
<p>needs should be conducted by doing tasks and needs analyses (Clark &amp; Estes,
</p>
<p>1996). Then, designers can develop alternative design solutions to be evaluated by
</p>
<p>the actual users. In both the design process and evaluation process, users should be
</p>
<p>involved in. Ways to involve users in the design, development, and evaluation of a
</p>
<p>product were shown in Table 5.1 (Preece et al., 2002).
</p>
<p>5.4 Learner-Centered Design
</p>
<p>Comparing with UCD, learner-centered design (LCD) emphasizes the importance
</p>
<p>of supporting students&rsquo; growth and their motivational needs in designing educa-
</p>
<p>tional software. Learner-centered indicates a move from ease-of-use issues toward
</p>
<p>the development of a student&rsquo;s comprehension and expertise. Table 5.2 shows the
</p>
<p>difference between users and learners.
</p>
<p>&bull; Users have the expertise in their work domains, and they understand the tasks
</p>
<p>they are accomplishing. Learners do not have the same domain knowledge as

<p>the user. They have neither the expertise of the work area nor the understanding
</p>
<p>of specific tasks of a professional counterpart.
</p>
<p>&bull; Users are homogeneous. They are engaged in specific work activities and share
</p>
<p>the same work culture, so they can be considered homogenous in some
</p>
<p>meaningful ways (Soloway et al., 1996). Learners are heterogeneous. They may
</p>
<p>not share a common culture, background, or understanding, so designers must
</p>
<p>consider the differences in the background, the diversity of learning styles, and
</p>
<p>other kinds of varieties of the learners&rsquo; groups.
</p>
<p>&bull; Users, by the nature of involvement in their work tasks, often have intrinsic
</p>
<p>motivations for their work, and tools do not have to provide any additional
</p>
<p>motivational incentives (Soloway et al., 1994). However, learners&rsquo; intrinsic
</p>
<p>motivations may differ from those of experts. Besides, because learners lack
</p>
<p>understanding of the work area, they may face more obstacles in completing the
</p>
<p>task at hand, thereby reducing their motivation even more.
</p>
<p>&bull; Users do not necessarily need to learn about their work from the tools. Instead,
</p>
<p>they need tools to help them finish their work. However, learners should learn
</p>
<p>when they engage in a new field of work by using educational software. So their
</p>
<p>tools, just as the learners themselves, (i.e., their windows in the field of work)
</p>
<p>need to grow and change.
</p>
<p>&bull; User-centered design should address the conceptual distance between computer
</p>
<p>users and the computer (Norman &amp; Draper, 1986). However, the
</p>
<p>learner-centered design should focus on the gulf of expertise that lies between
</p>
<p>novice learner and an expert in the knowledge domain.
</p>
<p>So, if we putting learners at the center of the product design, the special needs of
</p>
<p>learners must be considered (Soloway et al., 1994):
</p>
<p>1. Understanding is the Goal. When design the educational software, keep in
</p>
<p>mind that learners do not have the basic knowledge and skill in specific work
</p>
<p>domains. For example, they will not know the accounting principles or practices
</p>
<p>when a spreadsheet is presented to them. How will they learn to use that
</p>
<p>spreadsheet must be considered in the design process?
</p>
<p>2. Motivation is the Basis. We cannot count on the motivation of learners.
</p>
<p>Remember that both students and professionals have a strong tendency to fritter
</p>
<p>Table 5.2 Difference between users and learners
</p>
<p>Professional users Learners
</p>
<p>High expertise in the task domain Low expertise in the task domain
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Little change in users Learner develop and grow and they learn
</p>
<p>Design of their tools should primarily
</p>
<p>address gulfs between user and tool (i.e.,
</p>
<p>gulfs of execution and expertise)
</p>
<p>Design of their tools should primarily address
</p>
<p>gulfs between their knowledge and knowledge
</p>
<p>of an expert in the task domain
</p>
<p>84 5 Users Perspective of Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>away time or to procrastinate, when they are confronted with a task that they are
</p>
<p>not familiar or unprepared for. The educational software should be designed to
</p>
<p>support the learner&rsquo;s wavering motivation.
</p>
<p>3. Diversity is the Norm. Learners who use the specific tool are often from a
</p>
<p>diverse set of backgrounds, with various interests, skills, abilities, learning
</p>
<p>styles, etc. &ldquo;One size fits all&rdquo; will not satisfy the various needs of diverse
</p>
<p>learners.
</p>
<p>4. Growth is the Challenge. Learners can be very different from day 1 to day 100.
</p>
<p>They may have learned quite a bit about a problem domain and might have
</p>
<p>developed a set of skills and practices in that domain; however, most of the
</p>
<p>software doesn&rsquo;t change and grow. The individual has changed, but the
</p>
<p>knowledge and the specific practices of a task in the software haven&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>Therefore, learner-centered design must follow these basic tenets:
</p>
<p>&bull; Take learner&rsquo;s understanding as the result (through coaching, modeling, and
</p>
<p>critiquing).
</p>
<p>&bull; Create and maintain learner&rsquo;s motivation (through low cognitive load and
</p>
<p>immediate success feedback).
</p>
<p>&bull; Offer a wide range of learning techniques (by using different media and
</p>
<p>different ways of expression).
</p>
<p>&bull; Encourage the learner&rsquo;s growth (through an adaptable product). In other
</p>
<p>words, good scaffolding should be designed for students, and the scaffolding is
</p>
<p>available when the student needs it, but not when they want to study inde-
</p>
<p>pendently. Motivation can also be sustained by putting learners in the context of
</p>
<p>doing, developing software that enables them to construct artifacts and com-
</p>
<p>municate with others about those artifacts.
</p>
<p>Another theory should be mentioned for designing learning experience, the
</p>
<p>universal design for learning (UDL), which is a framework to improve and optimize
</p>
<p>teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights into how humans
</p>
<p>learn. Recognizing that the way individuals learn can be unique, the UDL frame-
</p>
<p>work drew upon from neuroscience and education research, was first defined by
</p>
<p>David H. Rose in the 1990s (Rose and Meyer, 2002). UDL is a framework for
</p>
<p>developing lesson plans and assessments based on the following three main prin-
</p>
<p>ciples (Meyer, Rose, and Gordon, 2014):
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide multiple means of engagement (the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of learning): UDL
</p>
<p>encourages teachers to look for multiple ways to motivate students. Letting kids
</p>
<p>make choices and giving them assignments that feel relevant to their lives are
</p>
<p>some examples of how teachers can sustain students&rsquo; interest. Other common
</p>
<p>strategies include making skill building feel like a game and creating opportu-
</p>
<p>nities for students to get up and move around the classroom.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide multiple means of representation (the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of learning): UDL
</p>
<p>recommends offering information in more than one format. For example,
</p>
<p>5.4 Learner-Centered Design 85</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>textbooks are primarily visual. But providing text, audio, video, and hands-on
</p>
<p>learning gives all kids a chance to access the material in whichever way is best
</p>
<p>suited to their learning strengths.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide multiple means of action and expression (the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of learning):
</p>
<p>UDL suggests giving kids more than one way to interact with the material and to
</p>
<p>show what they&rsquo;ve learned. For example, students might get to choose between
</p>
<p>taking a pencil-and-paper test, giving an oral presentation, and doing a group
</p>
<p>project.
</p>
<p>5.5 The ARCS Model of Motivational Design
</p>
<p>The ARCS model of motivational design is a theory created by John Keller rooted
</p>
<p>in analyzing the motivational characteristics of learners. It is a problem-solving
</p>
<p>approach to design the motivational aspects of learning environments to promote
</p>
<p>and sustain students&rsquo; motivation to learn (Keller, 1987).
</p>
<p>According to the ARCS model, there are four interrelated phases for stimulating
</p>
<p>and sustaining learner&rsquo;s motivation in the teaching and learning process: Attention,
</p>
<p>Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction (ARCS), as shown in Fig. 5.3.
</p>
<p>(1) Attention
</p>
<p>Attention in this theory refers to the interest of students in learning the
</p>
<p>concepts/ideas being taught. According to Keller (1997, 2009), there are two
</p>
<p>general ways to stimulate students&rsquo; attention. (1) Perceptual arousal uses
</p>
<p>surprise or uncertainly to gain interest and uses novel, surprising, incongruous,
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.3 ARCS model of motivational design. Adapted from Keller (2009)
</p>
<p>86 5 Users Perspective of Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and uncertain events; (2) Inquiry arousal stimulates curiosity by posing
</p>
<p>challenging questions or problems to be solved.
</p>
<p>In details, designers or teachers could use the following six methods to gain
</p>
<p>the students&rsquo; attention.
</p>
<p>&bull; Active participation: using strategies to get learners involved in the
</p>
<p>learning material/subject matter, such as games, role play or other hands-on
</p>
<p>methods.
</p>
<p>&bull; Variability: using a wide range of methods in presenting material to
</p>
<p>enhance presentation and account for diversity in learning styles, such as
</p>
<p>videos, short lectures, mini-discussion groups.
</p>
<p>&bull; Humor: using a small amount of humor to motivate attention (but not too
</p>
<p>much to be distracting).
</p>
<p>&bull; Incongruity and conflict: using statements that go against learners&rsquo; past
</p>
<p>experiences to provoke conflict and incongruity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Specific examples: using a visual stimulus, story, or biography.
</p>
<p>&bull; Inquiry: posing questions or problems for the learners to solve, such as
</p>
<p>brainstorming activities.
</p>
<p>(2) Relevance
</p>
<p>According to Keller, relevance could be established to increase a learner&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>motivation, by using language and examples that the learners are familiar
</p>
<p>with. The following six major strategies could be used to establish relevance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Experience. Tell the learners how the new learning will use their existing
</p>
<p>skills. We best learn by building upon our preset knowledge or skills.
</p>
<p>&bull; Present worth. What will the subject matter do for me today?
</p>
<p>&bull; Future usefulness. What will the subject matter do for me tomorrow?
</p>
<p>&bull; Needs matching. Take advantage of the dynamics of achievement, risk
</p>
<p>taking, power, and affiliation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Modeling. First of all, &ldquo;be what you want them to do!&rdquo; Other strategies
</p>
<p>include guest speakers, videos, and having the learners who finish their
</p>
<p>work first to serve as tutors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Choice. Allow the learners to use different methods to pursue their work or
</p>
<p>allowing a choice in how they organize it.
</p>
<p>(3) Confidence
</p>
<p>Confidence in the ARCS model focuses on building positive expectations for
</p>
<p>achieving success among learners. Learner&rsquo;s confidence level is often asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with motivation and the amount of effort that they put in completing a
</p>
<p>performance objective.
</p>
<p>5.5 The ARCS Model of Motivational Design 87</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In order to increase confidence, the following strategies could be considered.
</p>
<p>&bull; Help learners understand their likelihood for success. If they feel the
</p>
<p>objectives could never be accomplished or that the cost (effort or time) is
</p>
<p>too high, their motivation will shrink.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide objectives and prerequisites. Help learners evaluate the proba-
</p>
<p>bility of success through clarifying performance requirements and assess-
</p>
<p>ment criteria. Guarantee that the students are aware of performance
</p>
<p>requirements and assessment criteria.
</p>
<p>&bull; Allow for success that is meaningful.
</p>
<p>&bull; Grow the learners. Allow small steps of growing during the whole
</p>
<p>learning process.
</p>
<p>&bull; Feedback. Provide feedback and support internal attributions for success.
</p>
<p>&bull; Learner control. Students should feel some degree of control over their
</p>
<p>learning and assessment. They should believe that their success is a direct
</p>
<p>result of the amount of effort they have put forth on their learning.
</p>
<p>(4) Satisfaction
</p>
<p>Learners must be rewarded or satisfied in some way, whether it is the praise
</p>
<p>from a higher up, a sense of achievement, or mere entertainment.
</p>
<p>The following three main strategies could be used to promote satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&bull; Intrinsic reinforcement. Encourage and support intrinsic enjoyment of the
</p>
<p>learning experience. Example: The teacher invites former students to
</p>
<p>provide testimonials on how learning these skills helped them with sub-
</p>
<p>sequent homework and class projects.
</p>
<p>&bull; Extrinsic rewards. Provide positive reinforcement and motivational
</p>
<p>feedback. Example: The teacher awards certificates to students as they
</p>
<p>master the complete set of skills.
</p>
<p>&bull; Equity. Maintain consistent standards and consequences for success.
</p>
<p>Example: After the term project has been completed, the teacher provides
</p>
<p>evaluative feedback using the criteria described in class.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>1. UX is a person&rsquo;s perceptions and responses that result from the use or antici-
</p>
<p>pated use of a product, system, or service; system, user, and the context of use
</p>
<p>are the three factors that influence UX.
</p>
<p>2. The honeycomb model to design for UX includes the seven elements of useful,
</p>
<p>usable, desirable, findable, accessible, credible, and valuable.
</p>
<p>3. UCD is a broad term to describe design processes in which end users influence
</p>
<p>how a design takes shape. Understand and specify the context of use, specify the
</p>
<p>user and organizational requirements, produce design solutions, and evaluate

</p>
<p>evaluation, and the process is iterative. The design addresses the whole user

</p>
<p>of users and learners include their knowledge in the task domain, the
</p>
<p>homogenous population or diverse population, their motivation to engage in the

<p>6.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In Chap. 5, the essential points of user experience were introduced. Learner
</p>
<p>experience is a notion derived from user experience in software engineering and is a
</p>
<p>kind of general experience. The subject of a learning experience is the learner, just
</p>
<p>as the subject of a user experience is the user. Learner experience is important to
</p>
<p>instructional design and the development and refinement of learning environments
</p>
<p>just as user experience is important for software design, development, and refine-
</p>
<p>ment (Dutton, 2017). Effective learner experiences result in engaging and memo-
</p>
<p>rable educational experiences. In fact, learner experience is a key factor in keeping
</p>
<p>instructional design relevant. There is now a great variety of learning technologies
</p>
<p>as well as many different learning environments, learning spaces, and learning
</p>
<p>situations available to designers and developers. While many people are involved in
</p>
<p>designing, developing, and deploying these technologies, in this chapter, the focus
</p>
<p>is primarily on learners&rsquo; experiences with these technologies, as those experiences
</p>
<p>have implications for design, development, and deployment.
</p>
<p>For more than a hundred years, the classroom has been a major element in
</p>
<p>support of teaching and learning processes. A typical classroom is designed to
</p>
<p>accommodate various things such as chairs, desks, shelves, cabinets, a blackboard
</p>
<p>or whiteboard, and audiovisual equipment (Udin &amp; Rajuddin, 2008). In the
</p>
<p>mid-1990s, schools began to implement programs to bring digital technologies into
</p>
<p>classrooms. These technologies included desktop computers, laptop computers,
</p>
<p>interactive whiteboards, digital projectors, Internet access, productivity and
</p>
<p>curriculum-related software, and printers. More recently, 3D printers and virtual
</p>
<p>and augmented reality equipment have been introduced in some classrooms.
</p>
<p>Educational technologies impact learner experience. The focus of this chapter is
</p>
<p>on determining how well technologies fit learners&rsquo; needs and expectations. One
</p>
<p>issue to be elaborated is the concept of learner experience. The second issue to be
</p>
<p>elaborated is the evaluation of educational technology from the perspective of
</p>
<p>learner experience.
</p>
<p>6.2 Experience and Learner Experience
</p>
<p>Every day, people go to school, participate in classes and school activities, and have
</p>
<p>learning experiences. The idea that students have learning experiences seems
</p>
<p>simple enough, but what is meant by a learning experience?
</p>
<p>We all know that a singular experience is made up of an infinite amount of minor
</p>
<p>experiences, relating to contexts, people, and products. Moreover, the experience
</p>
<p>can be divided into different stages. Please think of your experience of camping on
</p>
<p>a huge mountain, which might be made up of smaller experiences, such as seeing
</p>
<p>the trees, rivers, feeling the breeze, and you recognize it appreciated and the climb
</p>
<p>from the bottom to the ascent, during the process you have interactions with
</p>
<p>products such as one&rsquo;s tent and cook stove, and interactions with companions on
</p>
<p>92 6 Learner Experiences with Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the trip. Moreover, when you come back from the camping, you tell the story of
</p>
<p>climbing the mountain to your peers, which you may refer it as &ldquo;a terrific
</p>
<p>experience.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Often, the word &ldquo;experience&rdquo; and the concept of &ldquo;user experience&rdquo; are used
</p>
<p>during product design and development processes. We want initially to create a
</p>
<p>systemic way to talk about the experience broadly. Our understanding of existing
</p>
<p>theories of experience has led to three ways that we speak of experience: cognitive
</p>
<p>experience, an experience, and experience as a story (see Table 6.1).
</p>
<p>Definition of Experience
</p>
<p>The purest form of reference is experience, the constant stream that happens during
</p>
<p>moments of consciousness. Self-talk or self-narration is often the way that people
</p>
<p>acknowledge the passing of this kind of experience (Forlizzi &amp; Ford, 2000). This
</p>
<p>definition is based on cognitive scientist Richard Carlson&rsquo;s theory of consciousness
</p>
<p>known as Experienced Cognition (Carlson, 1997). The above example mentioned
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;one sees the beautiful landscapes, and feel pleasant&rdquo; is an example of such
</p>
<p>experience.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Another way to talk about experience is to talk about having an experience&mdash;
</p>
<p>what philosopher John Dewey referred to in his book Art as Experience (Dewey,
</p>
<p>1938). This type of experience has a beginning and an end, and changes the user,
</p>
<p>and sometimes, the context of the experience as a result. For example, your
</p>
<p>experience of climbing the mountain. Another example of an experience is wit-
</p>
<p>nessing a story that allows us to feel powerful emotions, assess our system of
</p>
<p>values, and possibly make changes in our behavior. The University of Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>Oncolink Web site (http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu) has a powerful selection of
</p>
<p>stories written by those who have experienced cancer themselves, or through loved
</p>
<p>ones, leading us through an experience as we read them.
</p>
<p>A third way to discuss experience is to talk about experience as a story, an idea
</p>
<p>that has been discussed at length by Schank (1990). Stories are the vehicles that we
</p>
<p>use to condense and remember experiences and to communicate them in a variety of
</p>
<p>situations to certain audiences. Experience as the story plays an important role in
</p>
<p>events as diverse as legal testimony and fantasy gaming. Because experience as the
</p>
<p>story is naturally communicative, it has relevance for sharing user findings with a
</p>
<p>design team of various disciplines.
</p>
<p>At present, the definition of user experience given by ISO is widely recognized.
</p>
<p>According to the ISO. 9241-210 standard, &ldquo;user experience is the cognition and
</p>
<p>response generated from the use of a product, system or service and expected use&rdquo;
</p>
<p>(ISO FDIS 9241-210, 2009).
</p>
<p>The definition of the learning experience is close to the user experience in that
</p>
<p>both involve cognitive processing and subsequent responses. Learning experiences
</p>
<p>represent the user experience from a learner&rsquo;s specific perspective in the interaction
</p>
<p>with an educational product or learning environment (Huang, Hu, &amp; Yang, 2015).
</p>
<p>Learning Experience
</p>
<p>Learning experience is a notion derived from user experience and is also a general
</p>
<p>kind of experience that may have associated feelings and biases. The subject of a
</p>
<p>learning experience is the learner, just as the subject of a user experience is the user.
</p>
<p>Learning experiences can be understood as a variety of experiences through the
</p>
<p>learning process, and in the learning environment (see http://edglossary.org/
</p>
<p>learning-experience/).
</p>
<p>According to the previous discussion, learning experiences can be defined as
</p>
<p>learners&rsquo; perceptions, responses, and performances through interaction with a
</p>
<p>learning environment, educational products, resources, and so on. Information
</p>
<p>processing learning theory can be used to explain such a process (Anderson,
</p>
<p>Matessa, &amp; Lebiere, 1997; see http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/). Likewise, Gagn&eacute; pointed
</p>
<p>out that the learner perceives various things and, after a series of information
</p>
<p>processes, the learner forms a conceptualization and then reacts (Gagn&eacute;, 1985).
</p>
<p>Learners&rsquo; perception of learning environment mainly refers to their perception of
</p>
<p>the people and the things, including resources, tools, learning community, com-
</p>
<p>munity education, learning styles, and teaching methods (Huang, Yang, &amp; Hu,
</p>
<p>2012). Perception enables a person to carry out actions in an environment (Elnaga,
</p>
<p>2012). According to Mahlke&rsquo;s user experience model (2008), learner perceptions

<p>can deepen cognitive processes and impact emotions and feelings. Perceptions can
</p>
<p>lead to follow-up actions, attitudes, and emotional experiences. A response to a
</p>
<p>learning experience can include emotional reactions and other kinds of responses.
</p>
<p>Performance in a learning experience mainly refers to the learner&rsquo;s behavior,
</p>
<p>including associated constructs such as learning effectiveness, efficiency, and
</p>
<p>achievement. Learning effectiveness refers to the degree to which intended out-
</p>
<p>comes were attained; learning efficiency refers to the time and effort to attain those
</p>
<p>outcomes; learning achievement not only emphasizes the achieving intended out-
</p>
<p>comes, but includes satisfaction and other related subjective experiences, such as
</p>
<p>confidence and continued interest in the subject area.
</p>
<p>As devices, products, software, systems, and services are increasingly included
</p>
<p>in learning, it is important to view learner experience in a holistic manner that
</p>
<p>includes all aspects of experiences. For example, in a healthy classroom learning
</p>
<p>environment, the students, teachers, and designers will be turning to concepts of
</p>
<p>sustainable design to address comfort-related issues such as hygiene, safety,
</p>
<p>acoustics, and availability of space, natural daylight and natural ventilation (OECD,
</p>
<p>2006). For a technology-rich classroom, the learning technology in a classroom
</p>
<p>encompasses virtual technologies, such as online presence and online resources,
</p>
<p>installed appliances, such as media presentation systems, remote interaction sys-
</p>
<p>tems, and room-scale peripherals, and mobile devices (Milne, 2006). So the learner
</p>
<p>experience in a classroom includes the experience of the learner in using furniture,
</p>
<p>equipment, devices, software systems, and services.
</p>
<p>6.3 Elements of Learner Experience with Educational
Technology
</p>
<p>6.3.1 Categories of Educational Technology
</p>
<p>Educational technologies can be divided into the following four categories: learning
</p>
<p>tools, educational resources, learning environments, and learning methods.
</p>
<p>(1) Learning tools are those digital and non-digital media used for the purpose to
</p>
<p>facilitate learning through interactions between people and systems, such as
</p>
<p>learning applications, multimedia devices (&ldquo;learning tools,&rdquo; 2017). Examples of
</p>
<p>learning tools include flash cards, mind maps, blogs, electronic dictionaries,
</p>
<p>expert systems, Web 2.0 tools, electronic performance support systems
</p>
<p>(EPSSs), mobile educational apps, table computers, and so on.
</p>
<p>(2) Learning resources are materials that can be used to support teaching, learning
</p>
<p>and research, such as textbooks, course readings, and other learning content.
</p>
<p>Examples of learning resources include educational video clips, open educa-
</p>
<p>tional resources, massive open online courses (MOOCs), and online libraries
</p>
<p>and repositories.
</p>
<p>6.2 Experience and Learner Experience 95</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(3) Learning environments refer to the diverse locations, contexts, and cultures in
</p>
<p>which students learn, such as classroom, cyberspace (Learning Environment,
</p>
<p>2013). Learning environments include traditional classrooms as well as online
</p>
<p>learning management systems.
</p>
<p>(4) Method is &ldquo;a way, technique, or process of or for doing something&rdquo;. (Definition
</p>
<p>of Method, n.d.) Learning method stands for the way of presentation of the
</p>
<p>specific contents of a subject that may be properly grasped and understood by
</p>
<p>learners. Examples include drill and practice, memorization, inquiry-based
</p>
<p>learning, collaborative learning, competency-based learning, and so on.
</p>
<p>6.3.2 Principles for Meaningful Learner Experience
with Educational Technology
</p>
<p>Learner experience with educational technology includes learners&rsquo; perceptions,
</p>
<p>responses, and performances of the learning environment, resources, and methods.
</p>
<p>The structure and elements of user experience can reveal the connotation and
</p>
<p>extension for the definition, which could enlighten us the structure and elements of
</p>
<p>learner experience with educational technology. Morville (2004) proposed a con-
</p>
<p>ceptual framework called user experience honeycomb (see Chap. 5) to describe the
</p>
<p>elements of user experience in designing Web sites.
</p>
<p>In order to create a meaningful and valuable user experience, the information in
</p>
<p>a Web site should be:
</p>
<p>(1) Useful: the content should be original and fulfill a need;
</p>
<p>(2) Usable: the Web site should be easy to use;
</p>
<p>(3) Desirable: image, identity, brand, and other design elements should evoke
</p>
<p>desirable emotion and appreciation;
</p>
<p>(4) Findable: the content should be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite;
</p>
<p>(5) Accessible: the content should be accessible to people with disabilities;
</p>
<p>(6) Credible: users should trust and believe what they see, hear, or read; and
</p>
<p>(7) Valuable: the Web site should deliver something valued by the user.
</p>
<p>Rubinoff (2004) also proposed that user experience was made up of four inter-
</p>
<p>dependent elements: branding, usability, functionality, and content. Branding
</p>
<p>includes all the aesthetic- and design-related items within a Web site. Branding
</p>
<p>refers to the site&rsquo;s projection of the desired organizational image and message.
</p>
<p>Functionality includes all the technical and behind-the-scenes processes and
</p>
<p>applications. It entails the site&rsquo;s delivery of interactive services to all end users, and
</p>
<p>it is important to note that this sometimes means the public as well as adminis-
</p>
<p>trators, instructors, and learners. Usability entails the general ease of use of all site
</p>
<p>components and features. Subtopics beneath the usability banner can include
</p>
<p>navigation and accessibility. Content refers to the actual content of the site
</p>
<p>96 6 Learner Experiences with Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(text, multimedia, images) as well as its structure, or information architecture. We
</p>
<p>look to see how the information and content are structured regarding defined user
</p>
<p>needs and client business requirements.
</p>
<p>To help define the objectives and scope of user experience efforts, as well as
</p>
<p>enable their meaningful measurement, Guo (2012) suggested a conceptual frame-
</p>
<p>work that describes four distinct elements of user experience, including value,
</p>
<p>usability, desirability, and adoptability, and how they interact with one another in
</p>
<p>driving better product designs.
</p>
<p>Learner experience in a learning environment with educational technology needs
</p>
<p>to consider classroom as an integrated system with classroom furniture, equipment
</p>
<p>and devices, software systems, and services. The four elements of user experience
</p>
<p>for products can be used to express the learner experience with educational tech-
</p>
<p>nology. While learner experience should consider the diversity of learners in a
</p>
<p>learning environment, we use &ldquo;adaptability&rdquo; to replace &ldquo;adoptability&rdquo; to show the
</p>
<p>diversity of needs from students. Also, the physical environment factors, such as
</p>
<p>light, temperature, and acoustics, play a major role for experience. So &ldquo;comforta-
</p>
<p>bility&rdquo; is also included in learner experience. Through the above analysis, the
</p>
<p>elements of learner experience include value, usability, desirability, adaptability,
</p>
<p>and comfortability, shown in Fig. 6.1.
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 6.1, value is the core element for learner experience with
</p>
<p>educational technology, which focuses on whether an educational product meets the
</p>
<p>needs of learners and whether it is effective for learning. Usability deals with the
</p>
<p>issue whether it is easy to use an educational product, services, resources, device,
</p>
<p>etc. Adaptability focuses on the flexibility of an educational technology and deals
</p>
<p>with the issue whether it adapts to learners&rsquo; different needs. Desirability asks for
</p>
<p>whether an educational technology is fun and engaging for learners; and com-
</p>
<p>fortability focuses on whether learners feel comfortable with the technology.
</p>
<p>Desirability
</p>
<p>Is it fun and engaging in 
activity?
</p>
<p>Usability
</p>
<p>Is it easy to use content and 
devices?
</p>
<p>Comfortability
</p>
<p>Is it comfortable in the 
classroom?
</p>
<p>Adaptability
</p>
<p>Does it adapt to learners?
</p>
<p>Value
</p>
<p>Does it meet learning 
needs of learner?

<p>Based on the above-proposed element, in the following section, technology-rich
</p>
<p>classroom would be illustrated as an example to show what indicators should be
</p>
<p>used to evaluate whether an educational technology is suited for learning.
</p>
<p>6.4 Indicators to Evaluate Learner Experience
</p>
<p>Learner experience with educational technology could be designed, improved, and
</p>
<p>assessed by considering the five elements of learner experience shown in Fig. 6.1.
</p>
<p>Value is the most core indicator of learner experience, and the other four elements
</p>
<p>should support and contribute to value. Services, equipping, and furnishing are the
</p>
<p>main factors in a technology-rich classroom, of which the indicators of learner
</p>
<p>experience derived from.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.2 depicts a technology-rich classroom at Beijing Normal University
</p>
<p>called a smart classroom, because it can adapt to the learner&rsquo;s needs. The learners in
</p>
<p>the picture are freshman majoring in educational technology. Learners are using
</p>
<p>their smart phones to scan the QR Code shown on the screen to get access to course
</p>
<p>resources.

<p>Figure 6.3 presents a framework for analyzing learner experience with educa-
</p>
<p>tional technology. The indicators proposed are suitable for the evaluation of general
</p>
<p>educational technologies, such as educational software, systems, products, devices,
</p>
<p>and educational resources and services.
</p>
<p>6.4.1 Value&mdash;Do Learners Value the Technology?
</p>
<p>From the holistic perspective, the value of learner experience refers to the positive
</p>
<p>or negative quality that renders the changes of the classroom, such as classroom
</p>
<p>furnishings and layout changes, the use of equipment, desirable or valuable for the
</p>
<p>learners.
</p>
<p>What drives an educational technology&rsquo;s value to the student? Educational
</p>
<p>technology features must be in alignment with learning needs. If a classroom

</p>
<p>6.4 Indicators to Evaluate Learner Experience 99</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>change is designed to support learning needs, teacher and learners may consider the
</p>
<p>layout changes and equipment valuable. Learning needs encompass more than just
</p>
<p>their explicit needs&mdash;things that learner know they want, but to include learners&rsquo;
</p>
<p>implicit needs&mdash;things that learners do not express as needs, which might be hidden
</p>
<p>in learning activities and be recognized by their teacher. To meet learners&rsquo; unex-
</p>
<p>pressed needs, educational technology should not only be easy-to-use products,
</p>
<p>such as devices and software, but also services that add much value to student
</p>
<p>learning.
</p>
<p>6.4.2 Usability&mdash;Do the Learners Find the Technology Easy
to Use?
</p>
<p>Usability refers to the ease of use and learnability of educational technology, which
</p>
<p>is composed of:
</p>
<p>(1) Learnability: how easy is it for teachers and students to accomplish basic tasks
</p>
<p>the first time they encounter the educational technology?
</p>
<p>(2) Efficiency: once teachers and students have learned the design of educational
</p>
<p>technology, how quickly can they perform teaching and learning tasks?
</p>
<p>(3) Memorability: when teachers and students return to the design after a period of
</p>
<p>not using it, how easily can they establish proficiency?
</p>
<p>(4) Errors: how many errors do teachers and students make, how severe are these
</p>
<p>errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
</p>
<p>(5) Satisfaction: does the educational technology meet the needs of learners?
</p>
<p>The design factors of an educational technology include systems, facilities, and
</p>
<p>software which have a significant influence on usability. Operating systems provide
</p>
<p>a software platform for the application programs to run. Microsoft Windows,
</p>
<p>Mac OS X, GNU/Linux are examples of popular operating systems being used in
</p>
<p>personal computers. Operating systems, with diverse features, provide different
</p>
<p>software to support various resources and learning activities. The facilities include
</p>
<p>devices, audio&ndash;video control system, projector, interactive whiteboard, student
</p>
<p>response system, and access to the wireless network. Software systems include
</p>
<p>learning management systems, resources providing system, and collaborative
</p>
<p>learning platform. Classroom network tools offer new possibilities for classroom
</p>
<p>interaction; they present ways of rapidly distributing information, exchanging ideas,
</p>
<p>and constructing shared artifacts that can support a variety of engaging and
</p>
<p>mathematically rich activities that would be more difficult or even impossible to
</p>
<p>implement in conventional classrooms (White, 2013). Within the context of
</p>
<p>learning tasks, a large part of desirability is attributable to innovative and recog-
</p>
<p>nizable design in user interface and interaction. User interface design includes
</p>
<p>well-organized navigation, nice-looking graphics, and sleek designs. Meanwhile,
</p>
<p>100 6 Learner Experiences with Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>interaction design includes the convenient, smooth, and multiple operations. More
</p>
<p>important, a desirable educational technology must engage the learner in their
</p>
<p>purpose of using.
</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, the following indicators for evaluating the usability
</p>
<p>of technology-rich classroom are proposed: (1) Is it easy to switch to another
</p>
<p>operating system? (2) How difficult is it to update the software and hardware
</p>
<p>involved? (3) Is it easy to access the Internet? (4) Are data connections available for
</p>
<p>different types of devices, such as USB, VGA, HDMI, etc.? (5) Are the user
</p>
<p>interfaces friendly and intuitive?
</p>
<p>6.4.3 Desirability&mdash;Do Learners Enjoy Engaging
with the Technology?
</p>
<p>Desirability refers to the attractiveness and engagement of the activities in educa-
</p>
<p>tional technology or the pleasing perception from teachers and students. A perva-
</p>
<p>sive goal in education is to engage students in learning so that they are attentive and
</p>
<p>mindful (Lavigne &amp; Mouza, 2013).
</p>
<p>Engagement involves three dimensions (Fredricks et al., 2004):
</p>
<p>(a) behavior (e.g., participation in activities such as the number of times students
</p>
<p>interact with virtual world characters, embedded tools, objects),
</p>
<p>(b) cognitive-motivational (e.g., putting forth the effort, the belief of competence in
</p>
<p>the content area or self-efficacy, desire to be optimally challenged),
</p>
<p>(c) emotions (e.g., interest, curiosity, sense of belonging, and affect). Engagement
</p>
<p>in an educational technology depends on the content presentation methods, the
</p>
<p>digital resource, software systems, and interactive design.
</p>
<p>Vahey et al. (2013) listed four key benefits when using dynamic-representation
</p>
<p>technologies in mathematics classrooms: (a) providing rich representations for the
</p>
<p>student to understand some difficult concepts, (b) providing an opportunity for the
</p>
<p>student to focus their attention on the same point, (c) supporting the utilization of
</p>
<p>narrative as a type of representation, and (d) engaging students in the class.
</p>
<p>Dynamic-representational environments have also been shown to increase student
</p>
<p>engagement in mathematics. In order to promote young children&rsquo;s collaborative
</p>
<p>communication and thinking skills in science learning activities, Kershner et al.
</p>
<p>(2010) suggested that the interactive white board can be used collaboratively in a
</p>
<p>variety of science activities closely related to common classroom practice, for that
</p>
<p>whiteboards provide the opportunity for children to interact with learning content,
</p>
<p>and it can satisfy the needs of more desirable vivid interaction for children.
</p>
<p>The indicators for desirability in a technology-rich classroom could address the
</p>
<p>following questions: (1) Does the size of projector screen match the classroom?
</p>
<p>(2) Do 1:1 computers/devices match the content? (3) Do interactive whiteboards
</p>
<p>match the activities? (4) Is the content presented on the screen using multi-screen
</p>
<p>technology? (5) Does the student response system provide active learning?
</p>
<p>6.4 Indicators to Evaluate Learner Experience 101</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.4.4 Adaptability&mdash;Do Learners Find the Technology
Personally Adaptive?
</p>
<p>Adaptability of an educational technology deals with the diversity of students and
</p>
<p>their learning preferences which result in a need to treat learners as individually as
</p>
<p>possible. Room layout should be flexible to meet the teacher&rsquo;s instruction and
</p>
<p>learner&rsquo;s collaboration; a software system should adapt to learning styles of the
</p>
<p>learners; and physical environment factors, such as lighting, temperature, and
</p>
<p>ventilation, should be adjusted to suit learners.
</p>
<p>Hill (2008) recognized that flexible, modern learning environments have
</p>
<p>potential to encourage students to participate in activities with peers as they acquire
</p>
<p>knowledge for themselves. About classroom layout, Lippman (2002, 2003) in
</p>
<p>studies of schools mentions that providing a variety of spaces within a single
</p>
<p>classroom may support child&ndash;adult/student&ndash;teacher interactions. Jamieson (2007)
</p>
<p>recognized that formal spaces such as lecture theaters, classrooms, and laboratories
</p>
<p>should have flexible layouts which support a diversity of teaching and learning
</p>
<p>approaches, although this is not always affordable or feasible.
</p>
<p>From the above analysis, combined with the emerging technologies and the main
</p>
<p>furnishing elements, we propose these questions for evaluating the adaptability of
</p>
<p>technology-rich classroom (1) Does the software system provide instant feedback?
</p>
<p>(2) Can students present and share their learning outcome easily? (3) Are the
</p>
<p>systems compatible with common devices? (4) Do data between the student and
</p>
<p>teacher change easily? (5) Is the classroom layout flexible for different learning
</p>
<p>activities? (6) Can the lighting system adapt to learners needs and available
</p>
<p>daylight?
</p>
<p>6.4.5 Comfortability&mdash;Do Learners Feel Conformable
with Educational Technology?
</p>
<p>Comfortability with educational technology focuses on providing physical and
</p>
<p>emotional well-being experience to learners when they are using educational
</p>
<p>technology, i.e., the user interface and environmental conditions consisting of
</p>
<p>various elements such as temperature, humidity, noise, thermal, air pressure, ven-
</p>
<p>tilation, air quality, acoustic, dust, vibration, lighting, airflows, radiation, and so on.
</p>
<p>Due to the increased use of media and technology in classrooms, the design of
</p>
<p>easy-to-use, adjustable lighting systems is more critical than ever. Lighting needs to
</p>
<p>be designed to the standards proposed by Illuminating Engineering Societies and
</p>
<p>the National Electrical Code&rsquo;s current recommendations. Lighting should be
</p>
<p>designed to meet the special program requirements for each instructional space
</p>
<p>(Clabaugh, 2004). Also, some studies show that the following factors are important
</p>
<p>design considerations:
</p>
<p>102 6 Learner Experiences with Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(1) Indoor air quality&mdash;mold and airborne bacteria have adverse effects on chil-
</p>
<p>dren&rsquo;s and teachers&rsquo; health.
</p>
<p>(2) Temperature and humidity&mdash;creates conditions which lead to Sick Building
</p>
<p>Syndrome, related absenteeism, and lowered mental acuity.
</p>
<p>(3) Ventilation and airflow&mdash;is an occupational health and safety issue because
</p>
<p>children require more air than adults. Studies indicate that airflow from win-
</p>
<p>dows is inadequate in schools to remove or prevent the buildup of carbon
</p>
<p>dioxide. Poor airflow leads to poor performance of tasks.
</p>
<p>(4) Thermal comfort&mdash;there is an optimum temperature for learning, retention, task
</p>
<p>performance, and job satisfaction.
</p>
<p>(5) Acoustics&mdash;good acoustics (quality rather than the amount of noise) are fun-
</p>
<p>damental to academic performance.
</p>
<p>(6) Building age, quality, and aesthetics&mdash;affect student and teacher perceptions of
</p>
<p>safety and well-being. Building age is not as important as the quality of con-
</p>
<p>struction conditions. Students perform better in modernized or new environ-
</p>
<p>ments, but it is hard isolating mediating factors, and therefore inconclusive.
</p>
<p>(7) Furniture, carpets, dampness, and pollutants can lead to health problems such as
</p>
<p>asthma (see, for example, Filardo &amp; Vincent, 2010).
</p>
<p>(8) Based on the critical factors for comfortability, the following indicators for
</p>
<p>evaluating the comfortability in a technology-rich classroom are proposed:
</p>
<p>(1) Does the lighting system support reading healthy? (2) Does air in the
</p>
<p>classroom meet the air quality standard? (3) Is the temperature in the classroom
</p>
<p>suitable for learning? (4) Does the classroom have good acoustics? (5) Does
</p>
<p>classroom decoration meet the students&rsquo; preference? (6) Is the learning device
</p>
<p>easy to operate?
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) With the fusion of technology, pedagogy, and space, learner experience with an
</p>
<p>educational technology gradually became essential for ensuring students&rsquo;
</p>
<p>engagement and performance.
</p>
<p>(2) Learning experiences can be understood as learners&rsquo; perceptions, responses,
</p>
<p>and performances through interaction with the learning environment, educa-
</p>
<p>tional product, resources, and so on.
</p>
<p>(3) Value, usability, adaptability, desirability, and comfortability are the five ele-
</p>
<p>ments in educational technology that will influence learner experience, which
</p>
<p>should be considered when build or rebuild learning space.
</p>
<p>(4) Learner experience will change when the furnishing (providing an audiovisual
</p>
<p>system, computers, devices, and software) and equipping (decorating classroom
</p>
<p>and changing layout) in educational technology changed, and service was one
</p>
<p>of the most key factors for improving learner experience with educational
</p>
<p>technology.

</p>
<p>7.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Social media is changing communication between individuals and organizations.
</p>
<p>People can now enjoy a new type of learning by integrating social media. With the
</p>
<p>aid of the Internet, learners can get access to courses, instructional materials, and
</p>
<p>co-learners anytime and anywhere. In addition, learning with social media can
</p>
<p>provide a high degree of interactivity among participants who are separated both
</p>
<p>geographically, temporally, and culturally. Social media afford students many of the
</p>
<p>benefits of face-to-face interaction without the need to travel to specific places at
</p>
<p>specific times.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will introduce educational technology from the perspective of
</p>
<p>social learning and discuss the roles of technology in social learning, describe ways
</p>
<p>to build and manage learning community, and indicate methods to measure group
</p>
<p>learning.
</p>
<p>7.2 Social Learning
</p>
<p>7.2.1 Definition
</p>
<p>Social learning was proposed by Bandura (1962), who believed people learn from
</p>
<p>others through observation, imitation, and modeling (Bandura, 1962; Bandura &amp;
</p>
<p>Walters, 1963). For example, when a child sees one is punished for stealing, the
</p>
<p>child knows stealing is bad behavior. However, Bandura&rsquo;s definition does not
</p>
<p>emphasize the social context that is often important for learning (Reed et al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Wenger (1998) describes social learning as active social participation in a com-
</p>
<p>munity of practice. Wenger and others stress the dynamic interaction between
</p>
<p>people and the context as they construct meanings and develop identities (Muro &amp;
</p>
<p>Jeffrey, 2008). In a sense, this is an extension beyond behaviorism and cognitivism
</p>
<p>to take into account the influence of others and the context (Reed et al., 2010).
</p>
<p>Reed et al. (2010) analyze social learning in terms of individual understanding, a
</p>
<p>community of practice, and social interactions in that community as follows:
</p>
<p>Social learning may be defined as a change in understanding that goes beyond the indi-
</p>
<p>vidual to become situated within wider social units or communities of practice through
</p>
<p>social interactions between actors within social networks (p. 6).
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.2.2 Benefits of Social Learning
</p>
<p>Social learning emphasizes the fact that individuals learn from social interactions in
</p>
<p>communities and groups. When students act as a part of a group, they can gain
</p>
<p>experience during collaboration and develop the important skills of critical think-
</p>
<p>ing, self-reflection, and co-construction of knowledge (Brindley, Walti, &amp; Blas-
</p>
<p>chke, 2009). Specific benefits of social learning can be summarized into four major
</p>
<p>categories: social, psychological, academic, and assessment as follows (Laal &amp;
</p>
<p>Ghodsi, 2012):
</p>
<p>Social benefits:
</p>
<p>&bull; Contributes to the development of social support system for students. Learners
</p>
<p>work in groups or communities through social learning, so they could get
</p>
<p>suggestions and information from others to deal with questions and problems.
</p>
<p>&bull; Helps to build various understanding among learners and instructors. The
</p>
<p>different experience of learner would result in various understanding to same
</p>
<p>things. Positive relationships between different kinds of people are encouraged
</p>
<p>in social learning to develop broad perspective and understanding.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establishes a positive atmosphere for collaboration. Learners participate in peer
</p>
<p>interactions usually hold a positive attitude and motivation that lead to active
</p>
<p>social responses to problems and results in a friendly environment.
</p>
<p>Psychological benefits:
</p>
<p>&bull; Student-centered instruction increases students&rsquo; self-esteem. In a social learning
</p>
<p>setting, instruction is learner-centered; learners are responsible for conducting
</p>
<p>inquiries, applying knowledge, and making meaning of new concepts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cooperation reduces anxiety. In social learning setting, learners are usually in
</p>
<p>supportive environments to manage conflict resolution and get help to solve
</p>
<p>problems.
</p>
<p>&bull; Develops students&rsquo; positive attitudes toward teachers. In a social learning set-
</p>
<p>ting, the environment is open, which allows a teacher to have smooth conver-
</p>
<p>sations with students. In addition, teachers can better know students and give
</p>
<p>proper guidance.
</p>
<p>Academic benefits:
</p>
<p>&bull; Classroom results are improved. Compared with face-to-face teaching, students
</p>
<p>in social learning deliver more complete reports, make higher quality decisions,
</p>
<p>and perform better on complex tasks that require groups to generate ideas and
</p>
<p>solutions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Critical thinking skills are promoted. When a learner interacts with others, the
</p>
<p>learner can analyze information from a broader perspective, which could
</p>
<p>improve his/her critical thinking skills.
</p>
<p>7.2 Social Learning 109</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Students are actively involved in the learning process. The learner is the center
</p>
<p>in a social learning context, so learners own the responsibility for learning. They
</p>
<p>are actively involved in the learning process and more likely to be interested in
</p>
<p>learning.
</p>
<p>&bull; Problem-solving techniques are enhanced.When students work in pairs or small
</p>
<p>groups, one person is listening, while others discuss the question under inves-
</p>
<p>tigation. All involved are developing valuable problem-solving skills by for-
</p>
<p>mulating and discussing ideas while receiving immediate feedback from
</p>
<p>co-learners.
</p>
<p>Assessment benefits:
</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborative teaching techniques utilize a variety of assessments. In social
</p>
<p>learning settings, the instructor has more chances to interact with students. Thus,
</p>
<p>instructors can assess students based on the quality of interactions in addition to
</p>
<p>exams and other artifacts.
</p>
<p>7.2.3 Features of Technology in Social Learning
</p>
<p>Nowadays, technology plays a vital role in social interactions. Example technolo-
</p>
<p>gies include Facebook, Friendster, LinkedIn, MySpace, Ning, Twitter, and WeChat.
</p>
<p>These tools involve large-scale networks and the ability to interact in and contribute
</p>
<p>to large groups. Blogs and wikis are also used but lack many of the benefits of
</p>
<p>social media tools (Spector, 2015).
</p>
<p>Social media is beneficial in promoting social learning, such as providing
</p>
<p>community platforms, learning resources and contents, and learning activities.
</p>
<p>Resta &amp; Laferri&egrave;re (2007) summarize the features of technology in social learning
</p>
<p>as follows:
</p>
<p>To promote student collaboration and knowledge creation. Collaboration can be
</p>
<p>thought of as the process of shared creation (Schrage, 1990). With the interactive
</p>
<p>nature of technology, students can communicate with others conveniently and
</p>
<p>represent knowledge clearly, which results in students&rsquo; active and deep engagement
</p>
<p>in collaboration.
</p>
<p>To enhance student cognitive performance or foster deep understanding. Social
</p>
<p>interaction is considered as a source of cognitive advancement (Resta &amp; Laferri&egrave;re,
</p>
<p>2007). With the help of technology, students could get smooth communication with
</p>
<p>each other. For example, mind management tools and concept maps can help
</p>
<p>present ideas clearly to support reflective thinking and deep understanding.
</p>
<p>To add flexibility of time and space for social learning. The virtual workspace
</p>
<p>has been increasing its popularity in people&rsquo;s daily life. Students can finish their
</p>
<p>work in different place and time; thus, they can overcome the trouble of place and
</p>
<p>time. For example, in MOOCs, although students come from different countries,
</p>
<p>they can work together because of virtual space provided by the course.
</p>
<p>110 7 Social Learning Perspective of Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To promote student engagement and keep track of student collaboration.
</p>
<p>Learning analytics and big data are useful in monitoring learner progress. Many
</p>
<p>learning platforms can track and analyze the behavior and learning processes to
</p>
<p>monitor and predict student&rsquo;s achievements and recommend interventions to pro-
</p>
<p>mote learning.
</p>
<p>7.2.4 Social Learning and Computer-Supported
Collaborative Learning
</p>
<p>There is an obvious relationship between social and collaborative learning as
</p>
<p>suggested. In addition, when technology is added to the mix, the relationship of
</p>
<p>computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and social learning is worth
</p>
<p>highlighting (Scardalmia &amp; Bereiter, 1994, 2006). Key aspects of CSCL build on
</p>
<p>Vygotsky&rsquo;s (1978) social development theory and incorporate Stahl&rsquo;s (2006) col-
</p>
<p>laboration to suggest a pedagogical approach that emphasizes he shared construc-
</p>
<p>tion of knowledge and understanding.
</p>
<p>7.3 Building and Managing Learning Communities
and Groups
</p>
<p>7.3.1 The Five Stages of Group Development
</p>
<p>Before building a group, how a group develops should be understood. Effective
</p>
<p>group development follows a structured process. Tuckman (1965), Tuckman and
</p>
<p>Jensen (1977) summarized that process regarding five stages: forming, storming,
</p>
<p>norming, performing, and adjourning (Fig. 7.1).
</p>
<p>Forming: People with same goals come together, and they need to know the
</p>
<p>similarities and differences of the team members. The critical thing at this stage is to
</p>
<p>let members becoming familiar with each other and their task. Discussing the scope
</p>
<p>of the effort, formulating the methods to deal with the task, and establishing the
</p>
<p>rules of engagement are relevant at this stage.
</p>
<p>Storming: When the group attempts to accomplish a task, conflicts about
</p>
<p>responsibility, division, or rules may surface. The important things at this stage are
</p>
<p>listening to others, clarifying ideas, finding solutions, and testing ideas.
</p>
<p>Norming: When the group overcomes a conflict, the members become more
</p>
<p>actively engaged and more involved in sharing information, maintaining commu-
</p>
<p>nity, and solving new issues. The important thing at this stage is group awareness
</p>
<p>that the group is effective. Indicators of group effectiveness at this stage are the
</p>
<p>clarification of interaction processes and taking actions to address problems.
</p>
<p>Performing: When the group reaches this stage, members are genuinely inter-
</p>
<p>dependent, and the group has developed a real unity. Group members are highly
</p>
<p>oriented to tasks; they collaborate smoothly and play different roles according to the
</p>
<p>7.2 Social Learning 111</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>group needs. The important thing at this stage is solving problems in the best way to
</p>
<p>promote group development. Not all group can reach this stage.
</p>
<p>Adjourning: The group is not always active or developing. A group can be
</p>
<p>terminated when the task is over or when the group disbands for any reason. The
</p>
<p>important thing at this stage is concluding the achievement, recognizing member&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>contributions, and giving members the chance to say good-byes to each other.
</p>
<p>Group development is not always linear. The group process can loop back to
</p>
<p>storming when there are unsolved conflicts, or when new members join or diffi-
</p>
<p>culties in understanding tasks arise. Establishing rules of engagement in early stages
</p>
<p>of a group development will help when the group encounters problems in later
</p>
<p>stages.
</p>
<p>7.3.2 Building and Managing Small Groups
</p>
<p>In a classroom environment, grouping has multiple possibilities. The person who
</p>
<p>will decide the grouping (students, teachers, or randomly assigned), depends on the
</p>
<p>task setting and group characteristics. Before considering the grouping, the group
</p>
<p>size should be determined. The ideal size of the group depends on the purpose and
</p>

<p>&bull; How old are the students?
</p>
<p>&bull; What materials are available for students to use?
</p>
<p>&bull; How comprehensive are these materials?
</p>
<p>After the group size is determined, different methods can be applied. Dreyer and
</p>
<p>Harder (2009) proposed four methods to build groups in classroom settings.
</p>
<p>&bull; Randomly
</p>
<p>&bull; According to scores
</p>
<p>&bull; According to interest
</p>
<p>&bull; According to feelings.
</p>
<p>When students are grouped, there is often a situation where someone is not
</p>
<p>included; the teacher needs to persuade the group to accept those students not
</p>
<p>already included in the group. Therefore, the task of grouping is often done by the
</p>
<p>teacher. Whichever grouping method used, students should be given a chance to
</p>
<p>change to another group. If students have the opportunity to participate in the
</p>
<p>selection of partners, their acceptance of learning with their partners will also
</p>
<p>increase. Thus, the freedom to change partners will play a positive role in pro-
</p>
<p>moting student participation.
</p>
<p>After the team has been identified, the role of each team member in accom-
</p>
<p>plishing the task needs to be clarified. Through this clear division of labor, the team
</p>
<p>can work together to enhance their confidence. In addition, the role of team
</p>
<p>members can vary depending on the task.
</p>
<p>7.3.3 Building and Managing Communities
</p>
<p>Learning communities provide necessary support for social learning. Learners
</p>
<p>interact with others in learning community and group to form social relationships.
</p>
<p>However, the establishment and management of a learning community need time
</p>
<p>and effort and follow the group development law. Essential elements for estab-
</p>
<p>lishing prosperous learning communities are informality, familiarity, honesty,
</p>
<p>openness, heart, passion, dialogue, rapport, empathy, trust, authenticity, disclosure,
</p>
<p>humor, and diverse opinions (Chapman, Ramondt, &amp; Smiley, 2005). According to
</p>
<p>the five stages to build a projected course by Waltonen-Moore et al. (2006), we
</p>
<p>propose the four stages of building and managing learning community:
</p>
<p>1. Introductions&mdash;This step is a getting-to-know-you phase. Some methods, such
</p>
<p>as self-introduction and ice-breaking tasks, can be used to create an initial and
</p>
<p>emotional connection with others in the community.
</p>
<p>2. Involved within the group&mdash;This step is a deeper understanding of group as a
</p>
<p>part of group. Some methods, such as making group rules and clarifying task
</p>
<p>division, can be used to make a deeper connection between individuals and the
</p>
<p>group.
</p>
<p>7.3 Building and Managing Learning Communities and Groups 113</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3. Form primary Interact&mdash;This step is a normalization phase. The individuals in
</p>
<p>the group begin sharing information with each other, for example, discussing the
</p>
<p>course contents. Some methods, such as providing feedback on interactions, can
</p>
<p>be used to promote interaction between the groups.
</p>
<p>4. Promote real collaboration&mdash;This step is a real collaboration phase. The indi-
</p>
<p>viduals begin to confirm their ideas and actively reflect themselves. Some
</p>
<p>methods, such as writing reflection, can be used to enhance group members&rsquo;
</p>
<p>collaboration.
</p>
<p>7.4 Analysis and Measure Social Learning
</p>
<p>The ability to measure and to appreciate the complexity of the processes of social
</p>
<p>learning has benefited from advances in methodologies and development of com-
</p>
<p>putational power.
</p>
<p>7.4.1 Social Interactions
</p>
<p>Individuals&rsquo; interaction pattern is an important assessment element of social
</p>
<p>learning. When people interact with each other, a social network is forming. The
</p>
<p>social network is a social structure made up of individuals (or organizations) called
</p>
<p>&ldquo;nodes,&rdquo; which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of interdepen-
</p>
<p>dency, such as interaction, friendship, and kinship (shown as Fig. 7.2).
</p>
<p>Assessment of social network should use a method named social network
</p>
<p>analysis. According to the constitution of social network, social network analysis
</p>
<p>usually focuses on several key terms, such as sociogram, density, centrality,
</p>
<p>in-degree, and out-degree (Cho et al., 2007; Jaewoo &amp; Woonsun, 2014; Martınez
</p>
<p>et al., 2003).
</p>
<p>Sociogram is the visualization to show the situation of the whole or the part of
</p>
<p>the social network (shown as Fig. 7.3). In the sociogram, the node represents the
</p>
<p>actor, the line represents the relationship between actors, and the arrow direction
</p>
<p>represents the information flow (Haythornthwaite &amp; De Laat, 2010).
</p>
<p>Density describes the connection degree of a network. It refers to the number of
</p>
<p>ties an actor has, divided by the total possible ties an actor could have
</p>
<p>(Haythornthwaite &amp; De Laat, 2010). For example, if there are ten actors, each actor
</p>
<p>could potentially have nine ties that means the actor could potentially connect to
</p>
<p>other nine actors. If an actor has six ties, the density of the network is 66.67% (6/9).
</p>
<p>The bigger the number of density stands, the better the connection of the network.
</p>
<p>Centrality describes the numbers of ties an actor has. The more ties an actor has,
</p>
<p>the higher centrality it is. When the network has direction, there are two indicators
</p>
<p>to explain centrality: in-degree and out-degree. For example, if actor A comments
</p>
<p>on actor B, then the direction between them is A point to B, so out-degree can be
</p>
<p>114 7 Social Learning Perspective of Educational Technology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>used to describe actor A (because it is the one commented) and in-degree can be
</p>
<p>used to describe actor B (because it is the one who received comments). If an actor
</p>
<p>has higher in-degree, it means the actor receives more information; if an actor has
</p>
<p>higher out-degree, it means the actor provides more information (Russo &amp; Koesten,
</p>
<p>2005).
</p>
<p>Case 1 Social interaction analysis of an online English-to-Chinese cooperative
</p>
<p>translation activity
</p>
<p>Yang, Guo, &amp; Yu, (2016) analyzed the social network of online
</p>
<p>English-to-Chinese translation activity. The participants are 48 sophomores
</p>
<p>majoring in educational technology at Jiangsu Normal University. They were
</p>
<p>randomly assigned to twelve groups of four students. The network formed by the
</p>
<p>group&rsquo;s interaction was directed.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.4 illustrates the social network of sociogram. From a sociogram, we can
</p>
<p>see each group has a connection, which means groups could communicate with
</p>
<p>other groups without obstacles.
</p>

</p>
<p>7.4 Analysis and Measure Social Learning 115</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The density of this sociogram is 0.65, which means it is a high-density network.
</p>
<p>Groups in the network are in touch with most of the other groups, and the infor-
</p>
<p>mation can flow freely among different groups.
</p>
<p>Table 7.1 indicates that Group 4 is most active in sharing information and has a
</p>
<p>strong influence on the network. Group 2 receives the most information but has a
</p>
<p>minimum of sharing. That is to say, Group 2 is in control of other groups and has
</p>
<p>little influence on others.
</p>
<p>7.4.2 Content Analysis
</p>
<p>When individuals interact with each other, especially discussing and chatting, the
</p>
<p>understanding of the content could become deeper within the interaction. The social
</p>
<p>interaction is usually related to knowledge building.
</p>
<p>Knowledge building can be considered as a form of deep constructivism
</p>
<p>(Scardamalia, 2002). Scardamalia and Bereiter (2006) defined knowledge building
</p>
<p>as the production and continual improvement of ideas of value to a community that
</p>
<p>involves individuals and groups coming to a deeper understanding through inter-
</p>
<p>active querying, discussing, and continuing improvement of ideas. It is worth
</p>
<p>noting that this notion of deep learning by educational psychologists and

<p>technologists is different from what computer scientists and artificial intelligence
</p>
<p>researchers call deep learning in the context of machine learning.
</p>
<p>Content interaction is usually measured by content analysis, which is a method
</p>
<p>to analyze the procedures with text (Rourke, Anderson, Garrison, &amp; Archer,2001).
</p>
<p>The text usually includes chats, discussion boards, and log file data. The content
</p>
<p>analysis includes three steps: (1) adopting a coding scheme, (2) coding the text,
</p>
<p>(3) analyzing the results.
</p>
<p>Case 2 Content analysis of a collaborative inquiry learning among four elementary
</p>
<p>schools in China
</p>
<p>Zheng (2017) analyzed the final products of a collaborative inquiry activity. The
</p>
<p>participants are 196 pupils from 4 classes in four elementary schools in China. The
</p>
<p>pupils were randomly assigned to the groups of four or five.
</p>
<p>At first, Zheng (2017) selected the coding scheme proposed by Zhang et al.
</p>
<p>(2011) to analyze the level of knowledge building. The scheme includes scien-
</p>
<p>tificness and complexity, as shown in Table 7.2.
</p>
<p>In order to make sure the coding is credible, two raters coded all the discussion
</p>
<p>text independently. The raters compared the coding, and Zheng calculated the
</p>
<p>inter-rater agreement that achieved 0.91.
</p>
<p>Finally, Zheng (2017) calculated the percent of each knowledge level. The result
</p>
<p>is shown in Table 7.3.
</p>
<p>Regarding scientificness, the result indicated that 0.4% of the discussion tran-
</p>
<p>scripts were prescientific, 1% of them were hybrid, 18.6% of them were basically
</p>
<p>scientific, and 64% of them were scientific. Zheng (2017) concluded that most
</p>
<p>learners had acquired scientific knowledge about tools in daily life.
</p>
<p>In complexity aspect, the result demonstrated that 16% of discourse transcripts
</p>
<p>were unelaborated facts, 67.3% of them were elaborated facts, only 0.9% of them
</p>
<p>were unelaborated explanations, and 15% of them were elaborated explanations.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Zheng (2017) concluded the finding indicated that most learners could elaborate
</p>
<p>terms, phenomena, and facts. However, only a few of them can provide elaborated
</p>
<p>explanations about tools in daily life. Zheng suggested that the teachers should
</p>
<p>provide more elaborated explanations to deepen the understanding of tools in daily
</p>
<p>life.
</p>
<p>7.4.3 Cognitive Task Analysis
</p>
<p>In addition to analyzing the content to be learned, it is often useful to analyze
</p>
<p>performing tasks and solve problem related to that content. Cognitive task analysis
</p>
<p>(CTA) is a well-established technique for doing such an analysis (Clark &amp; Estes,
</p>
<p>1996). CTA makes use of observations, interviews and talk-aloud techniques to
</p>
<p>extract both explicit and implicit experiences in solving problems and making
</p>
<p>decisions pertaining to the content to be learned. Common methods used in CTA
</p>
<p>include collecting preliminary knowledge (e.g., via document reviews), identifying
</p>
<p>relevant knowledge representations (e.g., in the form of concept maps or causal
</p>
<p>influence diagrams), applying knowledge elicitation techniques (e.g., interviews
</p>
<p>and think-aloud methods), and developing the results in a manner suitable for
</p>
<p>testing with less experienced persons. One key aspect of a cognitive task analysis is
</p>
<p>to identify key distinctions and decision points that influence what a problem solver
</p>
<p>or decision maker does.
</p>
<p>7.4.4 Group Performance
</p>
<p>The traditional assessment methods, such as final tests, submitting artifacts or
</p>
<p>products are adopted to analyze the group performance. Through these assessments,
</p>
<p>we can infer what they know, can do, or have accomplished in general (Mislevy
</p>
<p>et al., 2003).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A final test is a traditional method to evaluate the knowledge of learners. In the
</p>
<p>practice situation, making artifacts or products has been the standard assessment
</p>
<p>methods. The steps of product evaluating methods are similar to content analysis;
</p>
<p>both of them need to adopt an evaluation scheme. After that, products should be
</p>
<p>assessed according to the scheme.
</p>
<p>Case Products evaluation of a collaborative inquiry learning among four elemen-
</p>
<p>tary schools in China
</p>
<p>Zheng (2017) analyzed the final products of a collaborative inquiry activity. The
</p>
<p>participants are 196 pupils from 4 classes in 4 primary schools in China. The pupils
</p>
<p>in each class were randomly assigned to the groups of four or five. Finally, 48
</p>
<p>groups were formed.
</p>
<p>At first, Zheng (2017) chose the coding scheme proposed by Lai and Hwang
</p>
<p>(2015) to analyze the submitted products of learning groups. The scheme includes
</p>
<p>word, space, color, and theme. Each dimension is separated into three levels, shown
</p>
<p>at Table 7.4.
</p>
<p>Zheng (2017) evaluated the final products of groups according to the scheme and
</p>
<p>analyzed the means and standard deviations of group products. The results indi-
</p>
<p>cated that all of groups made great efforts to collaboratively draw the artifacts.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.5 is an example of the final products of groups.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) Social learning can be considered as a change in understanding that goes
</p>
<p>beyond the individual to become situated within wider social units or com-
</p>
<p>munities of practice through social interactions between actors within social
</p>
<p>networks.
</p>
<p>(2) Benefits of social learning can be summarized into three major categories:
</p>
<p>social, psychological, and academic.

<p>8.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>In this chapter, the focus will be first on some general principles of learning
</p>
<p>activities design and then on principles to consider when designing instructional
</p>
<p>systems.
</p>
<p>The first part of this chapter focuses on planning and implementing learning
</p>
<p>activities in accordance with Bloom&rsquo;s (1956) revised taxonomy (Anderson &amp;
</p>
<p>Krathwohl, 2001), Sweller&rsquo;s (1988) cognitive load theory, and also Mayer&rsquo;s (2003)
</p>
<p>principles of multimedia learning, with the goal of developing a basic skill for the
</p>
<p>reader to design learning activities.
</p>
<p>Instructional Design (Instructional Systems Design (ISD) is the practice of
</p>
<p>creating instructional experiences to support the development and acquisition of
</p>
<p>knowledge and skill (Merrill et al., 1996). There are many instructional design
</p>
<p>models, and many are variants of the generic ADDIE (a model, which refers to
</p>
<p>analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation). Instructional
</p>
<p>design is historically and traditionally rooted in cognitive and behavioral psy-
</p>
<p>chology, and constructivism (learning theory) also has influenced thinking in the
</p>
<p>field (Mayer, 1992). The second part of this chapter includes a discussion of big D
</p>
<p>(i.e., design and development considered from a life-cycle perspective; the
</p>
<p>larger-scale instructional systems development found in ADDIE).
</p>
<p>8.2 Learning Activity Design
</p>
<p>8.2.1 Learning Activity
</p>
<p>Learning activity is a particular kind of human activity whose primary objective is
</p>
<p>the development of knowledge, skills, and competencies. It is produced by the
</p>
<p>society in the process of history through special learning actions taken upon
</p>
<p>learning objects consistent with their substance and structure (Davydov, 1988;
</p>
<p>Hedegaard &amp; Lompscher, 1999). A learning activity is an interaction between a
</p>
<p>126 8 Designing Learning Activities and Instructional Systems</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>learner and an environment (optionally involving other learners, practitioners,
</p>
<p>resources, tools, and services) to achieve a planned learning outcome (Beetham,
</p>
<p>2004). It can be defined as specific interactions of learners with other people, using
</p>
<p>specific tools and resources, oriented toward specific outcomes.
</p>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s essential task is to get students to engage in learning activities that
</p>
<p>are likely to result in achieving outcomes (Shuell, 1986). What the student does is
</p>
<p>more important than what the teacher does. Each learning activity in the course
</p>
<p>should be intentional, meaningful, and useful.
</p>
<p>From the perspective of a teacher or designer, a complete learning activity
</p>
<p>consists of the following components: learning objectives, activities or tasks,
</p>
<p>learning methods and operational procedures, organizational forms, ways of
</p>
<p>interaction, forms of learning outcomes, activity monitoring rules, formative
</p>
<p>feedback, roles and responsibilities, learning evaluation rules, and evaluation cri-
</p>
<p>teria. Learning activities should include three essential elements: learning tasks,
</p>
<p>learning methods, and evaluation requirements (Huang, Kinshuk, &amp; Spector, 2013).
</p>
<p>From the perspective of learners, each learning activity includes four aspects:
</p>
<p>learning tasks, learning resources, evaluation methods, and learning support
</p>
<p>services.
</p>
<p>&bull; Learning tasks require a clear description of the learning outcomes so that the
</p>
<p>learners can explicitly understand what they should do in the associated activity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Learning resources include both non-digital and digital materials providing the
</p>
<p>learner with the necessary information and content, for example, textbooks,
</p>
<p>study guides, journal articles and reading packets, video clips, and online
</p>
<p>resources. The basic principle of preparing learning resources is that they should
</p>
<p>be adequate and appropriate to complete the learning tasks with the result of
</p>
<p>reducing redundant resources.
</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluation methods should adequately examine the completion of learning
</p>
<p>activities without focusing on the assessment of learners&rsquo; memorization of the
</p>
<p>learning contents.
</p>
<p>&bull; Learning support services are extremely important, so the instructors or tutors
</p>
<p>have to understand the learning difficulties and learning environment of the
</p>
<p>learners so as to facilitate effective communication with them.
</p>
<p>There should not be too many learning activities in a unit of instruction so as to
</p>
<p>minimize the extraneous cognitive burden placed on the learners. Learning objec-
</p>
<p>tives, student&rsquo;s acceptance of the activity considering their cognitive load, and the
</p>
<p>various resources provided for the activity are critical points of learning activity
</p>
<p>design. The learning objective is the starting point, and also the destination of
</p>
<p>learning activity design, while learner characteristics and resource conditions are
</p>
<p>constraints. To design learning activity better, we need to focus on some theories
</p>
<p>related to these points, such as Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy, Sweller&rsquo;s cognitive load theory,
</p>
<p>and Mayer&rsquo;s principles of multimedia learning.
</p>
<p>8.2 Learning Activity Design 127</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.2.2 Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy
</p>
<p>The primary purpose of learning objective analysis is to find out what learning
</p>
<p>outcome the learners can obtain after learning a specific part of the content, such as
</p>
<p>knowledge, skills, and so on. There are many ways to characterize learning
</p>
<p>objectives, and it requires a target classification framework to interpret systemati-
</p>
<p>cally. Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy is a familiar classic classification framework for analyzing
</p>
<p>the learning objectives.
</p>
<p>Benjamin S. Bloom (1956) developed a hierarchy of educational objectives,
</p>
<p>which is referred to as Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy, which covers the learning objectives in
</p>
<p>three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor.
</p>
<p>&bull; The cognitive domain includes intellectual skills and knowledge processing,
</p>
<p>which is the primary focus of most traditional education and is frequently used
</p>
<p>to structure curriculum learning objectives, assessments, and activities.
</p>
<p>&bull; The affective domain represents objectives that are concerned with attitudes and
</p>
<p>feelings.
</p>
<p>&bull; The psychomotor domain concerns what students might do physically.
</p>
<p>(Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001; Krathwohl, Bloom, &amp; Masia, 1964; Bloom,
</p>
<p>1956)
</p>
<p>8.2.2.1 Cognitive Domain
Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy within the cognitive domain includes the six levels: knowledge,
</p>
<p>comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. The six levels are
</p>
<p>classified hierarchically from the simplest action to the high-order thinking actions
</p>
<p>(Bloom, 1956). The six levels of Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy were arranged in a cumulative
</p>
<p>hierarchical framework, that is, achievement of complex skill or ability required
</p>
<p>achievement of the prior one (Krathwohl, 2002).
</p>
<p>(1) Knowledge
</p>
<p>&bull; Deals primarily with the ability to memorize and recall specific facts
</p>
<p>&bull; Example: Name common varieties of apple.
</p>
<p>(2) Comprehension
</p>
<p>&bull; Involves the ability to interpret, and demonstrate students&rsquo; basic under-
</p>
<p>standing of ideas
</p>
<p>&bull; Example: Compare the identifying characteristics of a Golden Delicious
</p>
<p>apple with a Granny Smith apple.
</p>
<p>128 8 Designing Learning Activities and Instructional Systems</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(3) Application
</p>
<p>&bull; Involves the ability to apply concepts and principles to novel practical
</p>
<p>situations
</p>
<p>&bull; Example: Would apples prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in
</p>
<p>vitamin C?
</p>
<p>(4) Analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Involves the ability to analyze concepts and separate concepts or principles
</p>
<p>into components
</p>
<p>&bull; Example: List four ways of serving foods made with apples and explain
</p>
<p>which ones have the highest health benefits. Provide references to support
</p>
<p>your statements.
</p>
<p>(5) Synthesis
</p>
<p>&bull; Involves the ability to blend elements and parts to form a whole
</p>
<p>&bull; Example: Convert an &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; recipe for apple pie to a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; recipe
</p>
<p>by replacing your choice of ingredients. Explain the health benefits of
</p>
<p>using the ingredients you chose versus the original ones.
</p>
<p>(6) Evaluation
</p>
<p>&bull; Involves the ability to make judgments of the value of a work
</p>
<p>&bull; Example: Which kinds of apples are best for baking a pie, and why?
</p>
<p>8.2.2.2 Affective Domain
The affective domain relates to emotions, attitudes, appreciations, and values, such
</p>
<p>as enjoying, conserving, respecting, and supporting. The affective domain is divi-
</p>
<p>ded into five main subcategories: receiving, responding, valuing, organization, and
</p>
<p>characterization (Spector, 2015).
</p>
<p>(1) Receiving
</p>
<p>&bull; Students pay attention passively, and it is about the student&rsquo;s memory and
</p>
<p>recognition as well. Without receiving, no learning can occur.
</p>
<p>(2) Responding
</p>
<p>&bull; Students participate learning process activity. They not only attend to a
</p>
<p>stimulus but also reacts in sometimes and some way.
</p>
<p>8.2 Learning Activity Design 129</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(3) Valuing
</p>
<p>&bull; Students attach and associate a value or some values to an object, phe-
</p>
<p>nomenon, or piece of information, and even the knowledge they acquired.
</p>
<p>(4) Organizing
</p>
<p>&bull; Students can put different values, information, and ideas and accommodate
</p>
<p>them within their schema together. They can compare, relate, and elaborate
</p>
<p>on what has been learned.
</p>
<p>(5) Characterizing
</p>
<p>&bull; Students can build abstract knowledge.
</p>
<p>8.2.2.3 Psychomotor Domain
Bloom has not compiled the taxonomy of the psychomotor domain, but several
</p>
<p>competing taxonomies for the psychomotor domain (e.g., Dave 1970; Simpson
</p>
<p>1966) have been created over the years. The psychomotor domain concerns things
</p>
<p>students might physically do. One popular versions of the taxonomy for the psy-
</p>
<p>chomotor domain belongs to Dave (1970), who presents the five levels of the
</p>
<p>psychomotor domain as imitation, manipulation, precision, articulation, and
</p>
<p>naturalization.
</p>
<p>8.2.2.4 Case Study
When design learning objective, it should be specific, operational, and measurable.
</p>
<p>Case: The Learning Objective of Newton&rsquo;s First Law
</p>
<p>&bull; Explain the content and meaning of Newton&rsquo;s first law (cognitive-
</p>
<p>comprehension).
</p>
<p>&bull; Illustrate and explain the simple phenomenon of daily life that resulted from the
</p>
<p>inertia (cognitive-comprehension).
</p>
<p>&bull; Experience the difficulty of the scientific research process, and realize the
</p>
<p>experimental and reasoning scientific research methods (affective).
</p>
<p>8.2.2.5 Extended Reading
With the development of learning theory, scholars have revised and improved
</p>
<p>Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy. Also, in the research field of objective classification, there are
</p>
<p>other scholars proposed different learning objectives&rsquo; classification framework from
</p>
<p>different perspectives.
</p>
<p>130 8 Designing Learning Activities and Instructional Systems</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(1) Revised Taxonomy
</p>
<p>Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy is a scheme for classifying educational goals, objectives, and
</p>
<p>standards. It provides an organizational structure and a common meaning to
</p>
<p>learning objectives classified in one of its categories.
</p>
<p>Lorin W. Anderson and David R. Krathwohl revisited the cognitive domain in
</p>
<p>the learning taxonomy to reflect a positive form of thinking and made some
</p>
<p>changes, such as changing the names from noun to verb forms, and slightly rear-
</p>
<p>ranging them (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001). In contrast to the single dimension of
</p>
<p>the original taxonomy, the revised framework is two-dimensional, cognitive process
</p>
<p>and knowledge dimension.
</p>
<p>The cognitive process dimension contains six categories from cognitively simple
</p>
<p>to cognitively complex: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create.
</p>
<p>The knowledge dimension contains four categories from concrete to abstract:
</p>
<p>factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive.
</p>
<p>In the revised taxonomy, the cognitive process dimension has six levels that are
</p>
<p>arranged in a hierarchical structure, but not as rigidly as in the original taxonomy
</p>
<p>(Krathwohl, 2002). In combination, the knowledge and cognitive process dimen-
</p>
<p>sions form a handy Table 8.1, the taxonomy table (see Table 8.1).
</p>
<p>(2) Gagn&eacute;&rsquo;s taxonomy Gagn&eacute; proposed five categories of learning objective:
</p>
<p>verbal information, intellectual skills, cognitive strategies, motor skills, and atti-
</p>
<p>tudes. Gagn&eacute; and Bloom represent learning objectives in different aspects, that
</p>
<p>Bloom&rsquo;s classification is more from the &ldquo;form&rdquo; of the learning objectives, and
</p>
<p>Gagn&eacute;&rsquo;s classification is mainly from the &ldquo;content&rdquo; point of view, and he did not
</p>
<p>subdivide affective and psychomotor domain. Gagne assumed that different types of
</p>
<p>learning outcomes required different learning conditions (Gagn&eacute;, 1987).
</p>
<p>8.2.3 Cognitive Load Theory
</p>
<p>Cognitive load theory is created for letting learners get information and learning
</p>
<p>content efficient. It is an instructional theory based on the field&rsquo;s knowledge of

<p>human cognitive architecture and can be used to recommend in instructional
</p>
<p>procedures.
</p>
<p>Cognitive load theory builds upon the human information processing model and
</p>
<p>placed its primary emphasis on relations between working memory and long-term
</p>
<p>memory during the 1980s and 1990s. It was developed out of the study of problem
</p>
<p>solving by John Sweller in the late 1980s (Sweller, 1988), which differentiates
</p>
<p>cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.
</p>
<p>8.2.3.1 Intrinsic Cognitive Load
Intrinsic cognitive load is the inherent level of difficulty associated with a specific
</p>
<p>instructional topic that cannot be altered due to the nature of the material (Sweller,
</p>
<p>1988). However, it needs to be considered in activity design so that knowledge can
</p>
<p>be communicated at the right grain size.
</p>
<p>8.2.3.2 Extraneous Cognitive Load
Extraneous cognitive load is generated by information presented to learners and is
</p>
<p>under the control of learning activity designers (Chandler &amp; Sweller, 1991). It can
</p>
<p>be attributed to the design of the learning materials, and it can and should be altered.
</p>
<p>Unnecessary information within the text or format may cause an overload in the
</p>
<p>working memory and will affect the learner&rsquo;s storage of information negatively.
</p>
<p>Multiple sources of information, unnecessary and comprehensive format, extra
</p>
<p>sounds, and long complex explanations are examples of extraneous cognitive load.
</p>
<p>8.2.3.3 Germane Cognitive Load
Germane cognitive load is devoted to the processing, construction, and automation
</p>
<p>of schemas. It is extra information that can be altered, just like the extraneous
</p>
<p>cognitive load. As the intrinsic cognitive load is thought to be permanent, it is
</p>
<p>suggested that the learning designers should limit extraneous load and promote
</p>
<p>germane load (Sweller, Van Merri&euml;nboer, &amp; Paas, 1998). However, germane
</p>
<p>cognitive load should be used for necessary schematic construction.
</p>
<p>8.2.3.4 Cognitive Load Theory with Learning Activity Design
Cognitive load theory is aimed at providing such explanations.
</p>
<p>First, in addition to short-term memory limitations, different kinds of cognitive
</p>
<p>load are distinguished. Intrinsic load is that which is inherent in the problem or
</p>
<p>situation itself and cannot be manipulated to any significant extent.
</p>
<p>Second, the extrinsic cognitive load is that which occurs in the situation context
</p>
<p>and which might be reduced or minimized.
</p>
<p>Third, the germane cognitive load is that which directs the learner to the essential
</p>
<p>features of the problem situation and allows some things to be ignored.
</p>
<p>Sweller argued that working memory has a limited capacity, so instructional
</p>
<p>methods should avoid overloading it with additional activities, which do not
</p>
<p>directly contribute to learning. The learning and instructional design should be used
</p>
<p>to reduce cognitive load in learners. When intrinsic or germane load is high (i.e.,
</p>
<p>132 8 Designing Learning Activities and Instructional Systems</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>when a problem is difficult), materials should be designed to reduce the extraneous
</p>
<p>load.
</p>
<p>In a word, cognitive load theory provides a general framework and has broad
</p>
<p>implications for learning activity design. It allows instructional designers to control
</p>
<p>the conditions of learning within an environment or, more generally, within most
</p>
<p>instructional materials. The implications for instructional design are clear:
</p>
<p>(a) Minimize extrinsic load factors in an instructional situation.
</p>
<p>(b) Help new learners focus on that which is essential without generating addi-
</p>
<p>tional extrinsic load.
</p>
<p>8.2.3.5 Case Study
In the stage of junior high school, the &ldquo;law of inertia&rdquo; is a crucial topic in relevant
</p>
<p>curriculum. It is hard for students to differentiate the concept that objects possess
</p>
<p>natural properties of uniform linear motion and stationary state from the concept of
</p>
<p>features that objects have in the inertia.
</p>
<p>(1) Intrinsic cognitive load: the law of inertia/Newton&rsquo;s first law
</p>
<p>(2) Extraneous cognitive load: suitable activity design or learning method
</p>
<p>(3) Germane cognitive load: Review the relevant laws, or provide different
</p>
<p>examples of Newton&rsquo;s first law.
</p>
<p>Design strategy:
</p>
<p>(1) Design physical and animation experiment presentation to reduce the intrinsic
</p>
<p>cognitive load.
</p>
<p>(2) Design a learning activity that recalls the simple phenomenon of daily life,
</p>
<p>which resulted from the inertia, for example, when the car starts or brakes
</p>
<p>suddenly, passengers will be tilted backward or forward.
</p>
<p>8.2.4 Mayer&rsquo;s Principles of Multimedia Learning
</p>
<p>If you are designing resources for learning activities or creating a PowerPoint
</p>
<p>presentation for a lecture, developing an online course, preparing to flip a class-
</p>
<p>room, you may need to reconsider how you will get students to engage in the
</p>
<p>learning materials.
</p>
<p>Mayer&rsquo;s cognitive theory of multimedia learning centers on the idea that learners
</p>
<p>attempt to build meaningful connections between words and pictures, which they
</p>
<p>learn more deeply than they could have with words or pictures alone (Mayer, 2009).
</p>
<p>One of the principal aims of multimedia instruction is to encourage the learner to
</p>
<p>construct a coherent mental representation of the material. The learner&rsquo;s job is to
</p>
<p>8.2 Learning Activity Design 133</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>make sense of the presented material as an active participant, ultimately con-
</p>
<p>structing new knowledge.
</p>
<p>8.2.4.1 Mayer&rsquo;s Principles of Multimedia Learning
Mayer (2009) identifies twelve multimedia learning or instructional principles
</p>
<p>which were developed from nearly 100 studies over the past two decades:
</p>
<p>(1) Coherence Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better when extraneous words, pictures, and sounds are excluded
</p>
<p>rather than included.
</p>
<p>(2) Signaling Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better when cues that highlight the organization of the essential
</p>
<p>material are added.
</p>
<p>(3) Redundancy Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better from graphics and narration than from graphics, narration and
</p>
<p>on-screen text.
</p>
<p>(4) Spatial Contiguity Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented near
</p>
<p>rather than far from each other on the page or screen.
</p>
<p>(5) Temporal Contiguity Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented
</p>
<p>simultaneously rather than successively.
</p>
<p>(6) Segmenting Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better from a multimedia lesson is presented in user-paced segments
</p>
<p>rather than as a continuous unit.
</p>
<p>(7) Pretraining Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better from a multimedia lesson when they know the names and
</p>
<p>characteristics of the main concepts.
</p>
<p>(8) Modality Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better from graphics and narrations than from animation and
</p>
<p>on-screen text.
</p>
<p>134 8 Designing Learning Activities and Instructional Systems</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(9) Multimedia Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better from words and pictures than from words alone.
</p>
<p>(10) Personalization Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better from multimedia lessons when words are in conversational
</p>
<p>style rather than formal style.
</p>
<p>(11) Voice Principle
</p>
<p>People learn better when the narration in multimedia lessons is spoken in a
</p>
<p>friendly human voice rather than a machine voice.
</p>
<p>(12) Image Principle
</p>
<p>People do not necessarily learn better from a multimedia lesson when the
</p>
<p>speaker&rsquo;s image is added to the screen.
</p>
<p>These twelve principles can divide into three groups based on the types of
</p>
<p>cognitive load, as shown in Table 8.2.
</p>
<p>8.2.4.2 Case Study
For learning design of Newton&rsquo;s first law, as the content is difficult and abstract, we
</p>
<p>have to use some multimedia resources.
</p>
<p>Design strategy:
</p>
<p>(1) Use flash or animation experiment presentation.
</p>
<p>(2) Use daily life examples and pictures.

<p>8.2.4.3 Extended Reading
</p>
<p>Mayer&rsquo;s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning
</p>
<p>Mayer&rsquo;s cognitive theory of multimedia learning is based on three assumptions: the
</p>
<p>dual-channel assumption, the limited capacity assumption, and the active pro-
</p>
<p>cessing assumption (Mayer, 2003).
</p>
<p>(1) The dual-channel assumption considers that working memory has auditory
</p>
<p>and visual channels based on Baddeley&rsquo;s theory of working memory (Bad-
</p>
<p>deley, &amp; Hitch, 1974) and Paivio&rsquo;s dual-coding theory(Paivio, 1971).
</p>
<p>(2) The limited capacity assumption is based on cognitive load theory. It states
</p>
<p>that each subsystem of working memory has a limited capacity.
</p>
<p>(3) The active processing assumption claims that people construct knowledge in
</p>
<p>meaningful ways when they pay attention to the relevant material and organize
</p>
<p>it into a coherent mental.
</p>
<p>Mayer&rsquo;s cognitive theory of multimedia learning claims that words and pictures are
</p>
<p>presented to the learner via a multimedia presentation, which is processed along two
</p>
<p>separate, non-conflicting channels, as shown in Fig. 8.1
</p>
<p>Information enters the sensory memory through the ears and eyes. The learner
</p>
<p>selects words and pictures actively from the sensory memory and enters the working
</p>
<p>memory where they are organized into a verbal model and a pictorial model.
</p>
<p>Each channel can process only a few information at a given time in working
</p>
<p>memory. Two models are then integrated with prior knowledge retrieved from
</p>
<p>long-term memory. This integration occurs within the working memory following
</p>
<p>each segmented portion of instruction offered to the learner in the multimedia
</p>
<p>presentation.
</p>
<p>8.3 Instructional Systems Design
</p>
<p>Instructional Systems Design is an iterative process of planning learning objectives,
</p>
<p>selecting instructional strategies, choosing media, and selecting or creating mate-
</p>
<p>rials and evaluation. It is characterized as learner-centered and goal-oriented,
</p>
<p>focusing on meaningful performance, assuming that outcomes can be measured,
</p>

<p>and procedures are based on empirical evidence, interactive, self-correcting, and
</p>
<p>typically a team effort. There are many instructional design models, and many of
</p>
<p>them are based on the ADDIE model, which comprises analysis, design, devel-
</p>
<p>opment, implementation, and evaluation.
</p>
<p>8.3.1 ADDIE Model
</p>
<p>The ADDIE model is a framework that displays generic processes that instructional
</p>
<p>designers and training developers do (Morrison, Ross, &amp; Kemp, 2010). It describes
</p>
<p>a process applied to instructional design to generate episodes of intentional learn-
</p>
<p>ing, as shown in Fig. 8.2.
</p>
<p>8.3.1.1 Analysis
The analysis is the first phase of the ADDIE Instructional Systems Design process,
</p>
<p>and its purpose is to identify the probable reasons for the absence of performance
</p>
<p>and recommend a solution. When completing the analysis phase, one should be able
</p>
<p>to determine if the instruction could bridge the performance gap, and the degree to
</p>
<p>bridge the gap, and then provide strategies to reduce the performance gap based on
</p>
<p>empirical evidence about the potential for success.
</p>
<p>The standard procedures and typical deliverable associated with the analysis
</p>
<p>phase are as shown in Table 8.3.
</p>
<p>(1) Validate the performance gap.
</p>
<p>Instructional designers are often requested to develop instruction for knowledge
</p>
<p>people already possess or skills people can already perform. The initial step in the
</p>
<p>instructional design process is to validate the performance gap and analyze the
</p>
<p>reasons or causes.
</p>
<p>The three main steps for validating the performance gap measure the actual
</p>
<p>performance, confirm the desired performance, and identify the causes of the per-
</p>
<p>formance gap.

<p>Designer measures the actual performance and confirms the desired performance
</p>
<p>through observe, test, interview, and data. When the extent of the performance gap
</p>
<p>has been determined, the next step is to identify the primary cause of the
</p>
<p>gap. Practically, causes for a performance discrepancy can be categorized as a lack
</p>
<p>of resources, lack of motivation, and lack of knowledge and skill.
</p>
<p>The procedure to validate the performance gap could be summarized in a pur-
</p>
<p>pose statement. The aim of the purpose statement is to state in brief and explicit
</p>
<p>terms the primary function of the instructional program and the context in which the
</p>
<p>instruction will occur.
</p>
<p>Instruction may be the best response to a performance gap in the case of lack of
</p>
<p>knowledge and skill. So the essential issue of designing instruction, a course, or a
</p>
<p>curriculum for students is to cope with the knowledge and skill deficiency.
</p>
<p>(2) Determine instructional goals.
</p>
<p>Determine instructional goals is to generate goals that respond to performance
</p>
<p>gaps that are caused by a lack of knowledge and skill. It describes the &ldquo;terminal&rdquo;
</p>
<p>tasks that students will perform at the end of the course, such as &ldquo;what will students
</p>
<p>be able to do as a result of participating in this course.&rdquo; The classification of
</p>
<p>instructional goals (also called learning objective) and how to write instructional
</p>
<p>goals could be found in the part of learning activity design in this chapter.
</p>
<p>(3) Confirm the intended audience.
</p>
<p>Confirm the intended audience is to identify the abilities, experiences, prefer-
</p>
<p>ences, and motivation of the student. The data collected will impact decisions
</p>
<p>throughout the remaining ADDIE process, which include but not limited to group
</p>
<p>identifications, general characteristics, numbers of students, location of students,
</p>
<p>experience levels, student attitudes, skills that impact potential to succeed in the
</p>
<p>learning environment.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(4) Identify required resources.
</p>
<p>This step is to identify all types of resources that will be required to complete the
</p>
<p>course and the entire ADDIE process. There are four types of resources, including
</p>
<p>content resources, technology resources, instructional facilities, and human
</p>
<p>resources.
</p>
<p>(5) Determine potential delivery systems.
</p>
<p>The procedure is to evaluate different instructional delivery systems and rec-
</p>
<p>ommend the best option(s) that has the highest potential to close the performance
</p>
<p>gap. Conventional delivery systems include but not limited to face-to-face,
</p>
<p>computer-based learning, video, Internet-based learning management systems, and
</p>
<p>virtual reality environment.
</p>
<p>(6) Compose a project/course management plan.
</p>
<p>This step is to create a consensual document that confirms the expectations of all
</p>
<p>parties involved in the project or course plan, which may have fours phases: ini-
</p>
<p>tiation, planning, execution, and closure. When doing a project management plan,
</p>
<p>the following four sections should consider: core instructional design team mem-
</p>
<p>bers, significant constraints, schedule tasks, and final report.
</p>
<p>8.3.1.2 Design
Design is the second phase of the ADDIE, with the purpose to confirm the desired
</p>
<p>performances and appropriate testing methods. After completing the design phase,
</p>
<p>one should be able to prepare a set of functional specifications for closing the
</p>
<p>performance gap due to the lack of knowledge or skills.
</p>
<p>The standard procedures and typical deliverable associated with the design phase
</p>
<p>are as shown in Table 8.4.
</p>
<p>(1) Conduct a task inventory.
</p>
<p>Conducting a task inventory is to identify the essential tasks required to achieve
</p>
<p>an instructional goal. A task inventory organizes the content so that the students can
</p>
<p>construct the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve the instructional goals.

<p>8.3 Instructional Systems Design 139</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The instructional design procedure is often referred to as task analysis, and a course
</p>
<p>may contain many learning tasks that facilitate students to achieve the instructional
</p>
<p>goals.
</p>
<p>The four steps for conducting a task inventory are: repeat the purpose statement,
</p>
<p>reaffirm the instructional goals, identify the primary performance tasks, and specify
</p>
<p>prerequisite knowledge and skills.
</p>
<p>(2) Compose performance objectives.
</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to compose objectives that are congruent with the
</p>
<p>instructional goals. An objective provides a way to evaluate when a specific desired
</p>
<p>performance has been attained. Categories of learning (such as Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy)
</p>
<p>can be used to specify learning outcomes.
</p>
<p>(3) Generate testing strategies.
</p>
<p>The aim of this step to create items to test students&rsquo; achievements. Testing
</p>
<p>strategies should have high fidelity between the task, the objective, and the test
</p>
<p>items. Test items should be authentic and simulate performance space.
</p>
<p>(4) Calculate return on investment.
</p>
<p>Calculate return on investment is to estimate the cost for completing the entire
</p>
<p>ADDIE process. The procedure for calculating includes calculating the training
</p>
<p>costs, the benefits derived from the training, and comparing the training benefits to
</p>
<p>the training costs. This can be considered a partial form of summative evaluation of
</p>
<p>the entire effort.
</p>
<p>8.3.1.3 Develop
Develop is the third phase of the ADDIE instructional design process, with the
</p>
<p>purpose to generate and validate the learning resources that will be required during
</p>
<p>the life of the instructional modules. After completing the develop phase, one
</p>
<p>should be able to identify all of the resources that will be needed to undertake the
</p>
<p>planned episodes of intentional learning.
</p>
<p>Also, one should also have selected or developed tools to implement the planned
</p>
<p>instruction, to evaluate the instructional outcomes, and to complete the remaining
</p>
<p>phases of the ADDIE instructional design process.
</p>
<p>The main procedures and typical deliverable associated with the develop phase
</p>
<p>are as in Table 8.5.
</p>
<p>(1) Generate content.
</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to generate learning plans. Content is the focal point for
</p>
<p>engaging students during the process of knowledge construction. However, content
</p>
<p>should be strategically introduced during the teaching and learning sessions. Thus,
</p>
<p>140 8 Designing Learning Activities and Instructional Systems</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>instructional strategies become the overt means by which knowledge, skills, and
</p>
<p>procedures are exchanged during an episode of intentional learning.
</p>
<p>(2) Select or develop supporting media.
</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to select or develop media sufficient to accomplish the
</p>
<p>performance objective(s) as well as the remaining ADDIE procedures. Effective
</p>
<p>media facilitates the construction and retention of knowledge and skills. Instruc-
</p>
<p>tional media are intended to enrich the learning experience by using a variety of
</p>
<p>tangible items to facilitate the performance objectives. Media should be chosen to
</p>
<p>support an instructional event. Do not choose instructional events to support a
</p>
<p>medium. All of the events of instruction should be mediated, although a single
</p>
<p>episode may have different types of media. Select or develop supporting media
</p>
<p>should consider learners&rsquo; cognitive load and Mayer&rsquo;s principles of multimedia
</p>
<p>learning media.
</p>
<p>(3) Develop guidance for the student.
</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to provide information to guide the student through the
</p>
<p>instruction. Providing guidance for navigating the instructional strategies enhances
</p>
<p>the learning experience. The format of the guiding artifact will vary depending on
</p>
<p>the instructional goals and the primary delivery system.
</p>
<p>(4) Develop guidance for the teacher.
</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to provide information to guide the teacher as he or she
</p>
<p>facilitates the episodes of intentional learning. Guiding artifacts reflect the
</p>
<p>designer&rsquo;s selection of tasks to be performed by the students, the definition of

<p>(5) Conduct formative revisions.
</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to revise the instructional products and processes before
</p>
<p>implementation. Instructional designers use evaluation for the specific purpose of
</p>
<p>improving the designed instruction so that it can fulfill its goal of reducing the
</p>
<p>performance gap.
</p>
<p>There are two main types of evaluation used in the ADDIE approach:
</p>
<p>&bull; Formative evaluation is the process of collecting data that can be used to revise
</p>
<p>the instruction plan before implementation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Summative evaluation is the process of collecting data following
</p>
<p>implementation.
</p>
<p>8.3.1.4 Implement
Implement is the fourth phase of the ADDIE instructional design process, with the
</p>
<p>purpose to prepare the learning environments and engage the students. After
</p>
<p>completing the implement phase, one should be able to work in an actual learning
</p>
<p>environment where the student can construct the new knowledge and skills.
</p>
<p>Most ADDIE approaches use the implement phase to transition the summative
</p>
<p>evaluation activities and other strategies that place into action the teaching and
</p>
<p>learning process.
</p>
<p>The standard procedures and typical deliverable associated with the implement
</p>
<p>phase are as shown in the Table 8.6.
</p>
<p>(1) Prepare the teacher.
</p>
<p>The aim of this phase is to identify and prepare teachers to facilitate the
</p>
<p>instructional strategies and the learning resources that have been newly developed.
</p>
<p>(2) Prepare the student.
</p>
<p>Identify and prepare students to actively participate in the instruction and
</p>
<p>effectively interact with the newly developed learning resources.

<p>8.3.1.5 Evaluate
Evaluate is the fifth phase of the ADDIE instructional design process, with the
</p>
<p>purpose to assess the quality of learning materials before and after implementation
</p>
<p>and to evaluate the instructional design procedures used to generate the instruc-
</p>
<p>tional products.
</p>
<p>Evaluation of instructional design focuses on measuring the student&rsquo;s ability to
</p>
<p>perform her or his newly constructed knowledge and skills in an authentic work
</p>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p>The standard procedures and typical deliverable associated with the evaluation
</p>
<p>phase are shown in the Table 8.7.
</p>
<p>(1) Determine evaluation criteria.
</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to identify perception, learning, and performance as the
</p>
<p>three main levels of evaluation associated with the instructional design. The ADDIE
</p>
<p>approach to instructional design in this book promotes three levels of evaluation.
</p>
<p>Level 1 measures such things as the students&rsquo; perceptions of the course content,
</p>
<p>resources used throughout the course, the comfort of the physical classroom
</p>
<p>environment, or the ease of navigation in a virtual classroom environment and the
</p>
<p>teacher&rsquo;s facilitation style. Level 2 evaluation measures learning that the student&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>ability to perform the tasks indicated in each of the goals and objectives. Level 3
</p>
<p>evaluation measures job performance that student&rsquo;s knowledge and skill as they are
</p>
<p>actually applied in an authentic work environment.
</p>
<p>(2) Select evaluation tools.
</p>
<p>There are a variety of measurement tools that are available to instructional
</p>
<p>designers. Each measurement tool has the attributes that render its effective for
</p>
<p>certain types of evaluation. A sample of evaluation tools includes but is not limited
</p>
<p>to questionnaire, interview, Likert scale, open-ended questions, survey, examina-
</p>
<p>tions, role-plays, observations, practice, simulations, authentic work tasks, perfor-
</p>
<p>mance checklists, supervisor assessments, peer reviews, and observations.
</p>
<p>8.3.2 Extended Reading
</p>
<p>There are many other instructional design models from different perspectives, for
</p>
<p>example, the 4C/ID model which is particularly well suited for planning instructional
</p>
<p>systems in support of complex and ill-structured learning tasks. Tennyson&rsquo;s model is

<p>based on what designers actually do and reflects the dynamic and complex nature of
</p>
<p>instructional design. In addition, new models are emerging that highlight the role of
</p>
<p>collaboration, co-construction of understanding, and team problem solving.
</p>
<p>8.3.2.1 The Four-Component Instructional Design Model
The four-component instructional design model (4C/ID) developed by van Mer-
</p>
<p>ri&euml;nboer (1997). The 4C/ID instructional model is characterized by four compo-
</p>
<p>nents: (1) learning tasks, (2) supportive information, (3) procedural information,
</p>
<p>and (4) part-task practice. Tasks are ordered by task difficulty, and each task is
</p>
<p>offered at the beginning a lot of scaffolding which will be reduced as the learner
</p>
<p>progresses.
</p>
<p>Table 8.8 shows the relationship of the four basic components to the associated
</p>
<p>steps involved in complex learning (van Merri&euml;nboer &amp; Kirschner, 2007).
</p>
<p>According to van Merri&euml;nboer et al. (2002), the 4C/ID model addresses at least
</p>
<p>three deficits in previous instructional design models.
</p>
<p>&bull; First, the 4C/ID model focuses on the integration and coordinated performance
</p>
<p>of task-specific constituent skills rather than on knowledge types, context, or
</p>
<p>presentation-delivery media.
</p>
<p>&bull; Second, the model makes a critical distinction between supportive information
</p>
<p>and required just-in-time information (the latter specifies the performance
</p>
<p>required, not only the type of knowledge required).
</p>
<p>&bull; Third, traditional models use either part-task or whole-task practice; the 4C/ID
</p>
<p>model recommends a mixture where part-task practice supports very complex,
</p>
<p>&ldquo;whole-task&rdquo; learning.
</p>
<p>8.3.2.2 Tennyson&rsquo;s Fourth-Generation ISD Model
The complexity of instructional design is evident in the Fourth-Generation
</p>
<p>Instructional Systems Design (ISD-4) model developed by Tennyson (Tennyson,
</p>
<p>1993). Tennyson&rsquo;s ISD-4 model is based on a synthesis of what instructional
</p>
<p>designers actually do.
</p>

</p>
<p>4C/ID

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The first component in ISD-4 is the situational evaluation. The purpose of this
</p>
<p>evaluation is twofold: Assess the learning problem/need (an interface between the
</p>
<p>ID author and the problem/need) and construct ID solution plan (a plan that pro-
</p>
<p>poses an instructional development process with an appropriate set of ISD
</p>
<p>activities).
</p>
<p>It emphasizes the notions of a situational evaluation and the fact that instruc-
</p>
<p>tional designers do not always start with analysis; the specific situation and cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances determine to a large extent what designers actually do (Spector, 2016).
</p>
<p>8.3.2.3 Emerging Models
Social networking and collaborative learning bring new aspects to the traditional
</p>
<p>instructional design models presented above. While the models elaborated above
</p>
<p>are well-established and can be modified to accommodate new communication
</p>
<p>technologies, it is worth noting that among the new models that are appearing in
</p>
<p>computer-supported collaborative learning, problem-based learning approaches,
</p>
<p>MOOCs, and other recent developments, one still finds the need to understand the
</p>
<p>nature of what is to be learned, who the learners are, and how progress will be
</p>
<p>determined. One exception is perhaps in the case of informal learning in which
</p>
<p>there may not be a well-defined learning goal.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) A learning activity is an interaction between a learner and an environment
</p>
<p>(optionally involving other learners, practitioners, resources, tools, and ser-
</p>
<p>vices) to achieve a planned learning outcome
</p>
<p>(2) Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy that attempts to cover the learning objectives in cognitive,
</p>
<p>affective, and psychomotor domains. Cognitive domain represents the intel-
</p>
<p>lectual skills and knowledge processing, which is the primary focus of most
</p>
<p>traditional education and is frequently used to structure curriculum learning
</p>
<p>objectives, assessments, and activities. Affective domain represents objectives
</p>
<p>that are concerned with attitudes and feelings. Psychomotor domain concerns
</p>
<p>what students might do physically.
</p>
<p>(3) The ADDIE model is a framework that displays generic processes that
</p>
<p>instructional designers and training developers do, which describes a process
</p>
<p>applied to instructional design to generate episodes of intentional learning.

<p>9.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Learning is changing in the twenty-first century. Learning happens in classrooms,
</p>
<p>homes, communities, and indoor and outdoor settings. The design of a learning
</p>
<p>space is important for desirable learning outcomes. Furthermore, technology has
</p>
<p>evolved and transformed our lives and society and learning space is enhanced by
</p>
<p>current high-quality technologies, such as interactive tutorials, wireless networks,
</p>
<p>whiteboards, and mobile devices. Maximizing student&rsquo;s learning is a top priority in
</p>
<p>designing or redesigning a learning space. Well-designed learning spaces support
</p>
<p>pedagogical practices that engage, challenge, and equip students with the knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, skills, and attributes they need to succeed in a complex and rapidly changing
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>This chapter will present the definition of a learning space and discuss how to
</p>
<p>evaluate learning spaces. In addition, the discussion will focus on how technology
</p>
<p>has enabled the implementation of learning spaces, in particular the usage of smart
</p>
<p>technologies.
</p>
<p>9.2 Learning Spaces
</p>
<p>Previous learning spaces mainly occurred outdoors, such as in a forest. For
</p>
<p>example, the later Xiang Order (circa 1046&mdash;256 BCE), which included private
</p>
<p>schools, academies and outdoor venues as well as the Imperial College in China.
</p>
<p>The modern learning environment appeared after the class teaching system pre-
</p>
<p>sented by Comenius in the sixteenth century in what is now called the Czech
</p>
<p>Republic (see http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Comenius).
</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, many new information technologies (e.g., multimedia, com-
</p>
<p>puters, digital projector, the Internet, courseware, network-based courses, tutorial
</p>
<p>Web sites and more) have entered into schools and classrooms. Learning spaces
</p>
<p>now constitute an emerging research area. The goal of a learning space is to
</p>
<p>promote independent, flexible, and engaged learning by providing learners with
</p>
<p>appropriate technologies and pedagogies. How to design and develop an effective
</p>
<p>learning space has thus become increasingly critical (Ellis &amp; Goodyear, 2016).
</p>
<p>9.2.1 Definition of Learning Space
</p>
<p>Learning space refers to a place and the surroundings associated with that place
</p>
<p>where teaching and learning occur; it may refer to an indoor or outdoor location, or
</p>
<p>to a physical or virtual environment (for example, the Journal of Learning Spaces
</p>
<p>located at http://libjournal.uncg.edu/index.php/jls).

<p>Formal learning is typically organized and structured and has learning objectives
</p>
<p>(OECD, 2017); formal learning is normally delivered by trained teachers in a
</p>
<p>systematic and intentional ways within a school or university.
</p>
<p>Informal learning is any learning that has no set objective in terms of learning
</p>
<p>outcomes and is never intentional from learner&rsquo;s standpoint, such as self-directed
</p>
<p>learning or learning from experience, (OECD, 2017) which usually occurs in
</p>
<p>learning commons, multimedia sandbox, and residential study areas.
</p>
<p>For both formal and informal learning, virtual learning environment refers to the
</p>
<p>kind of platform that supports mediated exchange of information between users and
</p>
<p>the system through such digital media as learning management systems, social
</p>
<p>media Web sites, and online virtual classrooms and environments.
</p>
<p>Learning spaces are designed to support, facilitate, stimulate, or enhance
</p>
<p>learning, and teaching. A learning space can be designed to support listening and
</p>
<p>taking notes (e.g., a lecture hall or traditional classroom). New technologies have
</p>
<p>added to the complexity of designing effective learning spaces and now require
</p>
<p>careful consideration of the pedagogy to supported learning. The characteristics of a
</p>
<p>learning space and its components include many variables, such as size, forms,
</p>
<p>shapes, environmental setting, technologies involved, intended activities and users,
</p>
<p>and so on.
</p>
<p>9.2.2 The Pedagogy-Space-Technology (PST) Framework
</p>
<p>Creating a learning space that could be used to encourage students to become
</p>
<p>actively engaged, independent, lifelong learners is a chief aim of twentieth-century
</p>
<p>pedagogy and a challenge for the design of learning spaces. The point here is that
</p>
<p>there are connections between pedagogy, technology, and the design of a learning
</p>
<p>space. These connections are evident in the TPACK (technological pedagogical
</p>
<p>content knowledge) framework (Koehler &amp; Mishra, 2007). There are a number of
</p>
<p>relationships among these connections which are elaborated later in line with the
</p>
<p>Pedagogy-Space-Technology (PST) framework (Fisher, 2005).
</p>
<p>The sequencing of items in the PST framework (Fig. 9.1) is important. Each of
</p>
<p>the three elements (pedagogy, space, and technology) influences each other in a
</p>
<p>reciprocal manner. For example, a desired pedagogy suggests a preferred way to
</p>
<p>arrange and use the space. In addition, a particular technology to be deployed may
</p>
<p>better fit some pedagogies and arrangements of the space than other possibilities.
</p>
<p>A particular space places constraints (or presents opportunities) on the introduction
</p>
<p>of certain types of technology while a given technology can impact how a space is
</p>
<p>used by teachers and students. In addition, the content to be learned and the students
</p>
<p>themselves need to be taken into account.
</p>
<p>Given the complexity and challenges of designing effective learning spaces that
</p>
<p>take into account the content, the learners, along with the pedagogy and technology
</p>
<p>involved, an iterative planning cycle that supports refinement and evaluation is
</p>
<p>often appropriate. Iterating through the PST framework several times during
</p>
<p>planning, development and the subsequent life cycle of a learning space is likely to
</p>
<p>9.2 Learning Spaces 151</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>have desirable outcomes; that is to say, think of PST as a cradle-to-grave frame-
</p>
<p>work. While only two life-cycle stages are represented in Table 9.1 (as the
</p>
<p>columns&mdash;Conception and Design and Implementation and Operation), the
</p>
<p>framework could be made more fine grained by splitting these into more than two
</p>
<p>columns corresponding to more life-cycle stages and writing appropriate questions
</p>
<p>for each stage. In addition, later stages could be added. Thus if a particular insti-
</p>
<p>tution has a prescribed set of project stages with decision points (a.k.a., key
</p>
<p>milestones), then the basic PST framework questions can be rewritten to suit the
</p>
<p>declared delivery steps or key decision stages for the institution; PST can be tai-
</p>
<p>lored to meet particular ways of doing work.
</p>
<p>9.3 Principles for Learning Space Design
</p>
<p>In this section, a number of principles to guide the effective design of learning
</p>
<p>spaces are discussed. The first consideration, however, is to focus on the use of the
</p>
<p>learning space, namely the activities to be supported in the space.
</p>
<p>9.3.1 Linking Activities to a Learning Space
</p>
<p>Multimodal learning settings can be collocated and clustered to allow in a space to
</p>
<p>fit the learning activities targeting those technologies. Some technologies and
</p>
<p>activities are useful in a wide variety of activities that make such clustering difficult.
</p>

<p>9.3.2 Principles to Guide Design
</p>
<p>The following principles constitute a high-level strategic guide for the design of
</p>
<p>new schools, the redevelopment of schools, and the repurposing of buildings and
</p>
<p>learning spaces to maximize student performance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Sustainable&mdash;the space should be designed to be sustainable
</p>
<p>&ndash; Enable a space to be easily reallocated and reconfigured.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Consider cost-effective items, utilities, delivery, and support.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Think ahead of future development of technologies, pedagogies, and uses.
</p>
<p>&bull; Personalized&mdash;the space should be personalized for students and teachers
</p>
<p>&ndash; Consider alternative and creative colors, sounds, pictures, and videos.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Involve students and teachers in making choices to promote personalization.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Use things that allow individual control and manipulation by students and
</p>
<p>teachers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Accessible&mdash;the space should be open and easily available for use by all
</p>
<p>&ndash; Use technologies that are easily moved to fit changing needs.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Use interactive work surfaces linked to mobile devices and notebooks.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Provide affordable access to online digital resources, services, and storage.
</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborative&mdash;the space should support collaboration when appropriate
</p>
<p>&ndash; Provide a space to support cooperative learning and group work when those
</p>
<p>pedagogies are involved.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Support relevant local, national, and global networks, partnerships, and
</p>
<p>learning communities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Engaging&mdash;the space should support learning engagement with content,
</p>
<p>other learners and teachers
</p>
<p>&ndash; Community, professional, and expert engagement.
</p>
<p>&ndash; To energize and inspire learners and tutors.
</p>
<p>&ndash; Faster, deeper learning.

These new rooms at Texas State University are on Alkek&rsquo;s main floor to the right of
</p>
<p>the caf&eacute;, behind the marble wall (see Fig. 9.2). Student could bring laptops (Mac &amp;
</p>
<p>PC compatible) and share screen (see www.library.txstate.edu/about/departments/

</p>
<p>mentioned above.
</p>
<p>&bull; Accessible: According to the introduction about collaboration room, four rooms
</p>
<p>have tables available with large monitors and power charging capability. Stu-
</p>
<p>dent can use mobile devices and notebooks to share screen.
</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborative: Collaboration room provides a space to support cooperative

<p>learning and group work for local students; furthermore, students can also have
</p>
<p>a group discussion with global students with the help of network.
</p>
<p>9.3.3.2 Beijing National Day School of China
The Beijing National Day School (BNDS), originally a school for children of the

<p>Movement pedagogy (see https://makerfaire.com/maker-movement/) on a large and
</p>
<p>comprehensive scale. Students design, develop, and market a variety of products
</p>
<p>associated with various subjects. VR and collaboration are evident throughout the

</p>
<p>The spaces include open squares, room in rooms, and reading areas for focused
</p>
<p>study.
</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborative: As a part of the concept of the &ldquo;Home away from home&rdquo;, it is a

<p>With the development of ICT in education, researchers have begun to conceptualize
</p>
<p>how learning environments can be made more effective, efficient, and engaging on a
</p>
<p>large and sustainable scale (Spector, 2014). Smart learning environments (SLE) are
</p>
<p>defined as physical environments that are enriched with digital, context-aware, and
</p>
<p>adaptive devices to promote better and faster learning (Koper, 2014). With tech-
</p>
<p>nology support, smart classrooms become places where teachers and students can
</p>
<p>have rich and immerse teaching and learning experiences not previously possible.
</p>
<p>Hwang (2014) presented the definition and criteria of SLE from the perspective of
</p>
<p>context-aware ubiquitous learning. Hwang (2014) also introduced a framework to
</p>
<p>address the design and development of SLE to support both online and real-world
</p>
<p>learning activities (Hwang, 2014) with the following principles:
</p>
<p>(1) Smart learning environments should integrate a physical environment and a
</p>
<p>virtual environment. In a smart learning environment, the perceptual, moni-
</p>
<p>toring, and regulating functions of a physical environment are further
</p>
<p>enhanced. The application of augmented reality can create a seamless inte-
</p>
<p>gration of virtual environment and physical environment.
</p>
<p>(2) Smart learning environments should provide better learning support and ser-
</p>
<p>vices according to the individual characteristics of learners. Smart learning
</p>
<p>environments emphasize the process record, personalized assessment, and
</p>
<p>evaluation of effects and content delivery of learners&rsquo; learning. According to
</p>
<p>the learner model, it plays a significant role in planning, monitoring, and
</p>
<p>evaluation in the development learner&rsquo;s learning capabilities.
</p>
<p>(3) Smart learning environments should support on-campus learning and
</p>
<p>off-campus learning, formal learning, and informal learning. The learners in
</p>
<p>this situation are not only campus learners, but also all people that have
</p>
<p>requirements of learning in their work.
</p>
<p>9.4.2 Key Features of Smart Learning Environments
</p>
<p>In the information age, the classroom environment is changing in ways to optimize
</p>
<p>learning with new technologies and alternative pedagogical approaches. The smart
</p>
<p>classroom is one of the significant changes in which the intelligence of classroom
</p>
<p>involves five dimensions: showing, manageable, accessible, real-time interactive,
</p>
<p>and testing (see Fig. 9.8) (Huang, Yang, &amp; Hu, 2012).
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Showing: The ways it presents can match learner&rsquo;s cognitive characteristics.
</p>
<p>The content presentation mainly characterizes the intelligence classroom
</p>
<p>information presentation ability, not only requesting the present content to be
</p>
<p>able to be visible clearly, but also demanding the present content suitable for
</p>
<p>learner&rsquo;s cognitive characteristic. These help enhance learner&rsquo;s understanding
</p>
<p>and processing of to study materials.
</p>
<p>&bull; Manageable: The flexible layout supports teaching activities. Environmental
</p>
<p>management mainly characterizes the layout diversity and management con-
</p>
<p>venience of smart classrooms. All the equipment, systems, and resources of the
</p>
<p>classroom should have a strong manageability, including classroom layout
</p>
<p>management, equipment management, physical environment management,
</p>
<p>electrical safety management, network management.
</p>
<p>&bull; Accessible: The abundant resources are helpful in transferring various ways of
</p>
<p>learning into practice. Resource acquisition is mainly characterized with the
</p>
<p>ability of resource acquisition and the convenience of equipment access in the
</p>
<p>classroom, involving three aspects of resource selection, content distribution,
</p>
<p>and access speed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Real-time Interactive: The deep-level interaction is helpful in discovering
</p>
<p>problems and providing timely feedback. Timely interaction is mainly charac-
</p>
<p>terized by the ability of smart classrooms to support teaching interaction and
</p>
<p>interpersonal interaction, involving three aspects of facilitation, smooth inter-
</p>
<p>action, and interactive tracking.
</p>
<p>&bull; Testing: The ability to perceive the physical environment and learning behaviors
</p>
<p>is the basis for a smart classroom. Situational perception mainly characterizes the
</p>
<p>perceptual ability of the physical environment and learning behavior of the smart
</p>
<p>classroom.

<p>9.4.3 The Constituent Elements of Smart Learning
Environments
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 9.9, the constituent elements of smart learning environments
</p>
<p>include six components resources, tools, learning communities, teaching commu-
</p>
<p>nity, learning ways, and teaching ways.
</p>
<p>&bull; Smart learning environments mainly consist of six elements of learning, namely
</p>
<p>resources, intelligent tools, learning community, teaching community, learning
</p>
<p>ways, and teaching ways.
</p>
<p>&bull; Learners and teachers interrelate and interact with the other four elements in
</p>
<p>teaching and learning, so as to promote the effective learning of learners. If
</p>
<p>learning and teaching were removed, smart learning environments cannot be
</p>
<p>regarded as learning environments.
</p>
<p>&bull; The occurrence of effective learning is the mutual result of individual knowl-
</p>
<p>edge construction and group knowledge construction. Learning community
</p>
<p>emphasizes interaction, collaboration, and exchange of learners, while teaching
</p>
<p>community is a continuum where teachers learn together, work collaboratively
</p>
<p>to pursue continuing professional development.
</p>
<p>&bull; Learning resources and intelligent tools provide support of both learning com-
</p>
<p>munity and teaching community. The development of learning community and
</p>
<p>teaching community is inseparable from the mutual effects of resources and
</p>
<p>tools. All kinds of intelligent tools provide comprehensive support of the &ldquo;in-
</p>
<p>telligence&rdquo; of the learning environments. At the same time, learning community
</p>
<p>and teaching community advance the evolution of resources and tools.

<p>Situation: In one math class, 60% of the students are sleeping, 20% of the
</p>
<p>students are following teacher, 20% of the students are playing with their phones,
</p>
<p>and teacher is reading the textbook.

<p>6. Think about the relation among main factors in logic model and in CIPP model.
</p>
<p>Explain the difference between outputs and outcomes. Which of those two is
</p>
<p>directly linked to goals and objectives?
</p>
<p>10.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Nowadays, the available and affordable resources and technologies which could
</p>
<p>support learning and instruction are plentiful. However, choosing the best resources
</p>
<p>for instruction in various situations is an increasingly challenging task for designers,
</p>
<p>teachers, administrators, and so on. According to Spector and Yuen (2016), the use
</p>
<p>of educational technology requires attention to (a) effective and efficient design,
</p>
<p>development, and deployment and (b) providing the best results for the relevant
</p>
<p>constituencies. In terms of how to make sure the educational technology is best
</p>
<p>used, the educational project design and evaluation provide an innovative approach
</p>
<p>to dealing with educational problems.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of educational project, the methods
</p>
<p>to design educational project, and the model to evaluate educational project. The
</p>
<p>purpose of this chapter is to help develop the capacity of the instructor to use project
</p>
<p>approach to fix the problems of education.
</p>
<p>10.2 Educational Project
</p>
<p>10.2.1 Definitions
</p>
<p>In universities, national education departments, or local school districts, there are
</p>
<p>lots of research or development projects, which show that using of project approach
</p>
<p>to solve educational problems is an essential method used by researchers and
</p>
<p>teachers. A project is a series of activities or a structure aimed at bringing about
</p>
<p>clearly specified objectives within a given time and budget (ILO, 2010). So as to
</p>
<p>educational project, the goals and objectives, budget and times, and clear beginning
</p>
<p>and ending should be considered.
</p>
<p>Educational project can be defined as a planned effort to bring about desired
</p>
<p>educational outcomes that have a budget, resources, a definite beginning, a dura-
</p>
<p>tion, and reasonably well-defined goals and objectives (Spector &amp; Yuen, 2016).

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.2.2 Characters of Educational Project
</p>
<p>According to the definition of educational project, we can know some characters of
</p>
<p>educational project, such as desired educational outcomes, clearly start and end, and
</p>
<p>well-defined goals and objectives. In order to achieve viability and sustainability, a
</p>
<p>development educational project, regardless of its size and extension, should be
</p>
<p>oriented to the following characteristics (ILO, 2010):
</p>
<p>&bull; The starting point of a project is the existence of a problem affecting a certain
</p>
<p>group.
</p>
<p>&bull; A project is a participatory exercise from start to end.
</p>
<p>&bull; A well-defined project is result-based.
</p>
<p>&bull; Being result-based, a project seeks clearly defined objectives or outcomes, and it
</p>
<p>includes a series of interrelated and coordinated activities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Whereas the problem is the project&rsquo;s starting point, the objectives are the end
</p>
<p>point.
</p>
<p>&bull; Project implementation is organized with a fixed budget, limited resources, and
</p>
<p>specific deadlines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Each project has a specific management structure.
</p>
<p>&bull; Each project includes a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system.
</p>
<p>&bull; A project has to be sustainable in relation to society, finance, institution, and
</p>
<p>environment.
</p>
<p>&bull; Finally, each project is unique.
</p>
<p>10.2.3 Life Cycle of Educational Project
</p>
<p>Every project must follow a series of phases, allowing the process to be booted
</p>
<p>before the problem is identified until it is resolved. This series of phases is known as
</p>
<p>the life cycle of project (shown in Fig. 10.1). Project life cycle generally involves:
</p>
<p>(1) tasks completed at each stage or substage and (2) the team responsible for each
</p>
<p>of the phases defined (Prabhakar, 2009). Figure 10.1 depicts a typical project cycle
</p>
<p>which is somewhat familiar to the instructional design model presented in a pre-
</p>
<p>vious chapter.
</p>
<p>10.2.3.1 Initiating Processes
The initiating processes determine the nature and scope of the project. The main
</p>
<p>purpose is understanding the situation of projects through analyzing the business
</p>
<p>needs/requirements in measurable goals, reviewing the current operations, and
</p>
<p>analyzing stakeholder input (including users and support personnel for the project).
</p>
<p>10.2.3.2 Planning Processes
After the initiation stage, the project is planned to an appropriate level of detail. The
</p>
<p>main purpose is to plan time, cost, and resources adequately to estimate the work
</p>
<p>10.2 Educational Project 167</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>needed and to manage risk effectively during project execution. Planning is an
</p>
<p>ongoing effort throughout the life of the project.
</p>
<p>10.2.3.3 Executing Processes
The executing phase ensures that the project management plans prepared at the
</p>
<p>planning stage are executed accordingly. This phase involves proper human
</p>
<p>resources, financial resources, and time arrangements. The output of this phase is
</p>
<p>the project deliverables.
</p>
<p>10.2.3.4 Controlling Processes
Project performance must be monitored and measured regularly to identify the
</p>
<p>outcomes from the plan. Controlling processes ensure the project objectives are met
</p>
<p>by monitoring and measuring progress regularly to identify outcomes from the plan
</p>
<p>so that corrective action can be taken when necessary. Controlling process also
</p>
<p>includes taking preventive action in anticipation of possible problems.
</p>
<p>10.2.3.5 Closing Processes
This is generally conducted at the end of the project to see whether the planned
</p>
<p>benefits were achieved. Lessons learned are underlined and could be documented so
</p>
<p>that they can be replicated or scaled up and integrated into future cooperative
</p>
<p>development strategies and projects.
</p>
<p>10.3 Design of an Educational Project
</p>
<p>10.3.1 Logic Models
</p>
<p>When planning educational projects, sometimes it needs to have a visual repre-
</p>
<p>sentation with the textual explanation together to illustrate the effort, the nature of
</p>
<p>the situation, the choice of a particular solution, and the expectation of specific
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.1 Life cycle of
</p>
<p>educational project
</p>
<p>168 10 Educational Project Design and Evaluation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>results of the effort. The visual representation can be called as a logic model. When
</p>
<p>designing an educational project, we should know what kind of problems to solve,
</p>
<p>what kind of effort would be applied, and what results would be achieved. In other
</p>
<p>words, we should know the goals, inputs, outputs, and outcomes (see Fig. 10.2).
</p>
<p>10.3.2 Goals
</p>
<p>A project has a goal and objectives, a beginning and an ending. The beginning
</p>
<p>could be analyzing problems and setting goals. The goals usually come from
</p>
<p>problems in the situation. Thus, the first thing we need to do is problem analysis.
</p>
<p>Every project aims to help solve a problem. The problem analysis can identify
</p>
<p>the negative aspects of the existing situation and establish a cause and effect
</p>
<p>relationship between the likely underlying causes of the problems in the situation.
</p>
<p>However, not all negative aspects are a problem. Each problem has a symptom that
</p>
<p>needs to be identified. The so-called symptoms refer to certain conditions, pro-
</p>
<p>cesses, feelings, or other phenomena or situations. Just like a person may have a
</p>
<p>headache because of a cold or it may be due to overwork. The headache is a
</p>
<p>symptom, and the cause of headache is the problem. Symptoms can be seen as a
</p>
<p>sign or indication of the problem. Spector and Yuan (2016) described a simplified
</p>
<p>problem analysis process, as follows (see Fig. 10.3):
</p>
<p>Step One:
</p>
<p>Use all the facts and available data to describe the problem symptoms. Select the

<p>most important problem symptom and ask: What happened? What is happening?
</p>
<p>What are the specific symptoms? Why does this happen?
</p>
<p>Step Two:

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Identify any emerging pattern. Record and compile possible explanations and
</p>
<p>ask: What proof do we have to prove that the problem exists? What is the impact of
</p>
<p>the problem?
</p>
<p>Step Three:
</p>
<p>Continue step one and step two until the explanation converges to some basic
</p>
<p>causal factors. Concern about the systemic interpretation and ask: What sequence of
</p>
<p>events led to the problem? What conditions allow the problem to happen? What
</p>
<p>other issues center around the occurrence of central problems?
</p>
<p>Step Four:
</p>
<p>Define the problem or problems by describing their root causes. Determine the
</p>
<p>system structure relationship that is creating the conditions that need to be corrected
</p>
<p>and ask: Why do causal factors exist? What is the real cause of the problem?
</p>
<p>Step Five:
</p>
<p>Determine the action or actions required to change the system relationship that
</p>
<p>created the problem or problems. Suggest implementing a solution and ask: How
</p>
<p>will the solution be achieved? Who is responsible? What are the risks of imple-
</p>
<p>menting the solution?
</p>
<p>When problem or problems are ensured, the goals or objectives are also
</p>
<p>emerged. The goals or objectives can be thought as the situation in the future, once
</p>
<p>problems have been resolved. The negative situations of the problem are converted
</p>
<p>into solutions and expressed as positive achievements of the objective.
</p>
<p>10.3.3 Input Factors
</p>
<p>To implement a project, input factors are necessary. Inputs typically include such
</p>
<p>things as resources required and obtained, training materials developed, training
</p>
<p>provided, results of quality reviews and small-scale field tests, and so on (Spector &amp;
</p>
<p>Yuan, 2016).
</p>
<p>A resource (input) plan helps to present all the materials and resources needed
</p>
<p>for project implementation. It lays down the requirements for staff, equipment and
</p>
<p>materials, and budgeting, and provides the cost of the required resources. The
</p>
<p>resource plan lists the requirements and costs of all necessary inputs: personnel,
</p>
<p>basic office premises or facilities, equipment and materials, or services such as
</p>
<p>special subcontracting supplies, training workshops, and other miscellaneous inputs
</p>
<p>(ILO, 2010).
</p>
<p>Resource (input) plans need to be tailored to specific activities and actions. For
</p>
<p>each activity, a list of inputs is prepared, which can then be aggregated by category
</p>
<p>to prepare an overall project resource plan (ILO, 2010). Figure 10.4 shows a sample
</p>
<p>of resource plan.
</p>
<p>170 10 Educational Project Design and Evaluation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3.4 Outputs
</p>
<p>In order to achieve the goals of the project, many activities or action needs to be set
</p>
<p>up. The outputs are the products of the activities. An output has to be: (1) delivered
</p>
<p>by the project, (2) demand-driven and not supply-led, (3) stated clearly in verifiable
</p>
<p>terms, and (4) feasible with the available budget (ILO, 2010).
</p>
<p>The outputs are achieved by setting measurable indicators. Indicators are an
</p>
<p>objective measure of whether and to what extent progress has been made (related to
</p>
<p>project objectives and outputs). Performance indicators usually need to be at the
</p>
<p>output level (ILO, 2010). And indicators of output should not be a summary of
</p>
<p>what has been stated at the activities, but rather a measurable result of the execution
</p>
<p>of the activity.
</p>
<p>When developing the indicators of outputs, the verification methods also need to
</p>
<p>be considered and designated. This will help test whether the indicators can actually
</p>
<p>be measured with reasonable time, money, and effort or not.
</p>
<p>The means of verification should specify (ILO, 2010):
</p>
<p>&bull; How to collect the information (e.g., from video records, sample surveys,
</p>
<p>observation,) and/or the available documented source (e.g., final products).
</p>
<p>&bull; Who should collect/provide the information (e.g., local government workers,
</p>
<p>contracted survey teams, the project management team).
</p>
<p>&bull; When information should be collected (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).
</p>
<p>10.3.5 Outcomes
</p>
<p>The outcomes are often divided into short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes. The
</p>
<p>short-term and medium-term outcomes are usually linked directly to the goal of the
</p>
<p>effort or the specific problem situation that drives the effort (Spector &amp; Yuan, 2016).
</p>
<p>For example, the problem is that too many high school students did not go to
</p>
<p>college to continue their studies. Then, the short- or medium-term result of this
</p>
<p>effort is to increase the rate of enrollment&mdash;perhaps by 15% in the short term and
</p>
<p>30% in the long term.
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.4 A sample of resource plan
</p>
<p>10.3 Design of an Educational Project 171</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>There are two points to emphasize at short-term and medium-term outcomes.
</p>
<p>First, the short- and medium-term outcomes should be directly and clearly linked to
</p>
<p>the situation of the problem and the goal of the effort. Second, the short- and
</p>
<p>medium-term outcomes are usually measured, like outputs (Spector &amp; Yuan, 2016).
</p>
<p>However, long-term outcomes are often unmeasurable for a variety of reasons
</p>
<p>(Spector &amp; Yuan, 2016). In education, the long-term outcomes might increase the
</p>
<p>quality of national population, the rate of employment in a particular field, or the
</p>
<p>rate of postgraduate entrancement. Those long-term outcomes can benefit the
</p>
<p>interest to the institution or to society. However, measuring these long-term results
</p>
<p>often exceeds the scope of the effort (Spector &amp; Yuan, 2016).
</p>
<p>10.3.6 A Representative Logic Model
</p>
<p>Some of the ideas presented in this chapter will be new to many readers. To help
</p>
<p>make the process of developing a logic model to guide design, development, and
</p>
<p>deployment of an educational project, an actual case is presented in abbreviated
</p>
<p>form next. This case involved a multi-year effort in a large school district with about
</p>
<p>40 schools and nearly 50,000 students to redo the entire computing infrastructure of
</p>
<p>the district so as to be able to implement personalized and adaptive learning
</p>
<p>throughout the school district. Needless to say, this was a very large project with
</p>
<p>many different stakeholders, including administrators, staff, teachers, students, and
</p>
<p>parents. It was evident at the beginning of the effort that key administrators and
</p>
<p>many teachers were enthusiastic about the effort. However, since such an effort
</p>
<p>would eventually involve all teachers as the key implementers of what was being
</p>
<p>developed, emphasis would be placed on strong and ongoing support for teachers,
</p>
<p>including a series of training sessions as the effort evolved.
</p>
<p>In addition, it was imagined that some teachers would resist the dramatic
</p>
<p>changes planned. As a consequence, to gain support from all teachers, the first-year
</p>
<p>effort was devoted to addressing the concerns teachers had with the existing
</p>
<p>computer systems&mdash;primarily issues involving the student information system.
</p>
<p>Such things as a requirement for multiple log-ins to different parts of the system and
</p>
<p>duplicate entry of student data were reported and addressed first in an effort to gain
</p>
<p>widespread support for subsequent efforts that would affect teaching activities&mdash;
</p>
<p>namely creating individual learning plans for each learner that were previously only
</p>
<p>required for learners with disabilities. Special care was taken to automate and
</p>
<p>support as much of that new task as possible while helping teachers to adjust to new
</p>
<p>roles shifting from primary disseminators of information to coaches helping indi-
</p>
<p>vidual learners develop understanding.
</p>
<p>A generic logic model and an actual logic model that was initially developed for
</p>
<p>the project described above are depicted below, as shown in Figs. 10.5 and 10.6.
</p>
<p>While a logic model is intended to depict what is being done in an educational
</p>
<p>project, the model is usually complemented with a description of the rationale for
</p>
<p>the effort, which is called a theory of change. As a simple example, suppose a game
</p>
<p>is being designed and developed to help young learners understand how plants are
</p>
<p>172 10 Educational Project Design and Evaluation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>classified. An initial analysis of the problem situation might have suggested that
</p>
<p>students find the subject boring and do not spend sufficient time practicing clas-
</p>
<p>sifying various examples. Research strongly suggests that the time spent on a
</p>
<p>learning task and that timely, informative feedback tend to improve learning per-
</p>
<p>formance. A game can potentially engage learners so that they are spending more
</p>
<p>time practicing albeit in the form of a game, and the game can also provide
</p>
<p>immediate feedback. Such a rationale becomes part of a theory of change, creating
</p>
<p>in effect a chain that goes from motivation to more time learning and more feedback
</p>
<p>to improved learning outcomes.
</p>
<p>10.4 Evaluation of Educational Project
</p>
<p>The purpose to evaluate the project is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the
</p>
<p>completed project, to determine the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and
</p>
<p>sustainability of the project to achieve the goal (ILO, 2010).
</p>
<p>According to the logical framework, evaluation can be adapted in four aspects:
</p>
<p>context evaluation, input evaluation, process evaluation, and product evaluation.
</p>
<p>This evaluation model is named CIPP evaluation model developed by Daniel
</p>
<p>Stufflebeam and colleagues (Stufflebeam, 1971).

<p>Fig. 10.5 A generic logic model
</p>
<p>10.3 Design of an Educational Project 173</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The CIPP evaluation model includes two key dimensions, as shown in
</p>
<p>Table 10.1. The vertical dimension includes three steps in the evaluation process:
</p>
<p>delineating, obtaining, and providing. Delineating refers to the delineation of
</p>
<p>questions to be answered and the information obtained; obtaining refers to
</p>
<p>obtaining relevant information; providing refers to the provision of information to

<p>decision makers so that they can use it to make decisions and thereby to improve
</p>
<p>ongoing plans. The horizontal dimension includes four kinds of evaluation: context,
</p>
<p>input, process, and product (Stufflebeam, 1971, 2003).
</p>
<p>Context evaluation provides information about the strengths and weaknesses of a
</p>
<p>total system to assist in planning improvement-oriented objectives at each level of
</p>
<p>the system (Stufflebeam, 2003). The content usually refers to understanding the
</p>
<p>relevant environment; diagnosing special problems; analyzing training needs;
</p>
<p>determining requirements; and setting project goals.
</p>
<p>Input evaluation provides information about the strengths and weaknesses of
</p>
<p>alternative strategies which might be chosen and structured for the achievement of
</p>
<p>given objectives (Stufflebeam, 2003). Input evaluation includes collecting training
</p>
<p>resource information; assessing training resources; determining how to effectively
</p>
<p>use existing resources to achieve training objectives; and determining whether the
</p>
<p>overall strategy for project planning and design requires the assistance of external
</p>
<p>resources.
</p>
<p>Process evaluation provides information about the strengths and weaknesses of a
</p>
<p>chosen strategy under conditions of actual implementation, so that either the
</p>
<p>strategy or its implementation might be strengthened (Stufflebeam, 2003). The
</p>
<p>purpose of the process evaluation is to provide information feedback to constantly
</p>
<p>modify or improve the implementation process of the project. Process evaluation is
</p>
<p>mainly achieved through the ways as insight into the potential causes of failures in
</p>
<p>the implementation process; suggestions for eliminating potential failures; analysis
</p>
<p>of unfavorable factors leading to failures in the implementation process; and
</p>
<p>methods for overcoming unfavorable factors.
</p>
<p>Product evaluation provides information for determining whether objectives or
</p>
<p>goals are being achieved and whether the change procedure which has been
</p>
<p>employed to achieve them should be continued, modified, or terminated (Stuf-
</p>
<p>flebeam, 2003). The main task of the product evaluation is to measure and explain
</p>
<p>the objectives of goals achieved by the activities of project, including both the
</p>
<p>measurement and the interpretation of the achieved goals.
</p>
<p>Evaluation, based on the indicators, focuses on the project&rsquo;s implementation
</p>
<p>process and how the project contributes to the goals. Evaluation is the last step of
</p>
<p>the project cycle, but it is not the end of a project. Indeed, it can be considered the
</p>
<p>starting point for a new planning process, because the conclusions of the evaluation
</p>
<p>will allow the stakeholders to draw lessons that may guide future decision making
</p>
<p>and project identification (ILO, 2010).
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) An educational project is a planned effort to bring about desired educational
</p>
<p>outcomes, which has a budget, resources, a definite beginning, a duration, and
</p>
<p>reasonably well-defined goals and objectives.
</p>
<p>(2) Every project has to follow a series of phases, allowing the process to be guided
</p>
<p>from the moment the problem is identified until it is solved. This series of
</p>
<p>10.4 Evaluation of Educational Project 175</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>phases is known as the life cycle of project, including initiating processes,
</p>
<p>planning processes, executing processes, and controlling processes.
</p>
<p>(3) The first step in the design phase is the identification goals of the project. The
</p>
<p>methodology used is called situation analysis. To prepare a result-based project,
</p>
<p>the following will have to be performed: (1) problem analysis and (2) objective
</p>
<p>analysis.
</p>
<p>(4) Typical structure of a logical framework includes: (a) key aspects of the current
</p>
<p>situation, (b) activities associated with the effort (inputs), (c) the anticipated
</p>
<p>results of those activities (outputs), and (d) short-, medium-, and long-term
</p>
<p>outcomes of the effort.
</p>
<p>(5) The CIPP evaluation model includes two key dimensions. The vertical
</p>
<p>dimension includes the three steps in the evaluation process called delineating,
</p>
<p>obtaining, and providing: delineating questions to be answered and information
</p>
<p>to be obtained, obtaining relevant information, and providing information to
</p>
<p>decision makers.

<p>11.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>There are two main types of educational research. The first is basic research, which
</p>
<p>is also referred to as an academic research approach. The second type is applied
</p>
<p>research (or contract research). Both of these research types have different purposes
</p>
<p>which influence the nature of the respective research.
</p>
<p>The basis for educational research is the scientific method. The scientific method
</p>
<p>uses directed questions and manipulation of variables to systematically find infor-
</p>
<p>mation about the teaching and learning process. This scenario questions are
</p>
<p>answered by the analysis of data that are collected specifically for the purpose to
</p>
<p>answer these questions. The two main types of data that are used under this method
</p>
<p>are qualitative and quantitative.
</p>
<p>Qualitative research uses data which are descriptive in nature. Tools that edu-
</p>
<p>cational researchers use in collecting qualitative data include observations, con-
</p>
<p>ducting interviews, conducting document analysis, and analyzing participant
</p>
<p>products such as journals, diaries, images, or blogs. Quantitative research uses data
</p>
<p>that are numerical and are based on the assumption that the numbers will describe a
</p>
<p>single reality. Statistics are often applied to find relationships between variables.
</p>
<p>Both quantitative and qualitative research are/or can be consistent with a basic or
</p>
<p>traditional scientific approach aimed at uncovering the relationship between vari-
</p>
<p>ables and factors involved in an implementation and learning outcomes.
</p>
<p>The element of design in learning and educational research has been paid more
</p>
<p>attention recently. One of the traditional factors addressed is the extent to which an
</p>
<p>approach or design contributed to or inhibited outcomes. Previously, that aspect
</p>
<p>was addressed by formative evaluations. Recently, the quality of the design process
</p>
<p>itself has come under closer scrutiny. Design-based research and design method-
</p>
<p>ology are becoming more and more important for educational technology research
</p>
<p>and educational product development. The following sections will introduce the
</p>
<p>design-based research in details.
</p>
<p>11.2 The Concept of Design-Based Research
</p>
<p>Design-based research (DBR) was proposed as design experiments in articles by
</p>
<p>Brown (1992) and Collins (1992). And now, it is a type of research methodology
</p>
<p>commonly used by researchers in the learning sciences. Design-based research is a
</p>
<p>systemic approach to the planning and implementing of innovations that emphasize
</p>
<p>an iterative approach to design with ongoing involvement collaboration with
</p>
<p>practitioners. DBR goes beyond formative evaluation research as the focus is on the
</p>
<p>rationale for design decisions and changes in the design as a technology-based
</p>
<p>learning effort evolves, although DBR can still be considered a kind of formative
</p>
<p>evaluation research (Spector &amp; Yuen, 2016).
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The solutions that result from educational design research can be educational
</p>
<p>products (e.g., a multi-user virtual world learning game), processes (e.g., a strategy
</p>
<p>for scaffolding student learning in online courses), programs (e.g., a series of
</p>
<p>workshops intended to help teachers develop more effective questioning strategies),
</p>
<p>or policies (e.g., year-round schooling). Researchers attempt to solve significant
</p>
<p>real-world problems while at the same time they seek to discover new knowledge
</p>
<p>that can inform the work of others facing similar problems (Spector &amp; Yuen, 2016).
</p>
<p>Within design-based research methodology, interventions are conceptualized
</p>
<p>and then implemented iteratively in natural settings to test the ecological validity of
</p>
<p>the dominant theory and to generate new theories and frameworks for conceptu-
</p>
<p>alizing learning, instruction, design processes, and educational reform.
</p>
<p>11.3 Key Characteristics of DBR
</p>
<p>Design-based research exhibits the following characteristics: pragmatic, grounded,
</p>
<p>interventionist, iterative, collaborative, adaptive, and theory-oriented (Cobb et al.,
</p>
<p>2003).
</p>
<p>Pragmatic: it is concerned with generating usable knowledge and usable solu-
</p>
<p>tions to problems in practice.
</p>
<p>Grounded: it uses theory, empirical findings, and craft wisdom to guide the
</p>
<p>work.
</p>
<p>Interventionist: it is undertaken to make a change in a particular educational
</p>
<p>context.
</p>
<p>Iterative: it evolves through multiple cycles of design, development, testing, and
</p>
<p>revision.
</p>
<p>Collaborative: it requires the expertise of multi-disciplinary partnerships,
</p>
<p>including researchers and practitioners, but also often others (e.g., subject matter
</p>
<p>specialists, software programmers, or facilitators).
</p>
<p>Adaptive: the intervention design and sometimes also the research design are
</p>
<p>often modified in accordance with emerging insights.
</p>
<p>Theory-oriented: it uses theory to ground design, and the design and develop-
</p>
<p>ment work is undertaken to contribute to a broader scientific understanding.
</p>
<p>11.4 The Process of Design-Based Research
</p>
<p>The design-based research process has been described as iterative, as well as
</p>
<p>flexible (Kelly et al., 2008). While multiple cycles of activity are clearly present
</p>
<p>across most models and frameworks, flexibility is present in all models. Figure 11.1
</p>
<p>11.2 The Concept of Design-Based Research 181</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>shows the generic model for conducting design-based research, and it contains
</p>
<p>these features (McKenney &amp; Reeves, 2012):
</p>
<p>&bull; Three core phases in a flexible, iterative structure: analysis, design, and
</p>
<p>evaluation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Dual focus on theory and practice: integrated research and design processes;
</p>
<p>theoretical and practical outcomes.
</p>
<p>&bull; Indications of being use-inspired: planning for implementation and spread;
</p>
<p>interaction with practice; contextually responsive.
</p>
<p>11.4.1 Analysis and Exploration
</p>
<p>The first phase of design-based research is the analysis and exploration, which
</p>
<p>includes problem identification and diagnosis. As noted by Bannan-Ritland (2003):
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first phase of design-based research is rooted in essential research steps of
</p>
<p>problem identification, literature survey, and problem definition&rdquo; (p. 22). In line
</p>
<p>with the exploratory nature of design research, driving questions should, therefore,
</p>
<p>be open in nature. In this phase, people state problems through consultation with
</p>
<p>researchers and practitioners, analysis the research questions, and do a literature
</p>
<p>review.
</p>
<p>The main products resulting from this phase are both practical and theoretical.
</p>
<p>From the practical perspective, this phase generates a clear understanding of the
</p>
<p>problem and its origins as well as specification of long-range goals. In addition,
</p>
<p>partial design requirements are determined by exploring the opportunities and
</p>
<p>boundary conditions present; and initial design propositions are generated based on
</p>
<p>contextual insights.
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.1 A generic model for conducting design-based research. Adapted from McKenney and
</p>
<p>Reeves (2012)
</p>
<p>182 11 Design-Based Research</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>From the theoretical perspective, this phase produces a descriptive and analytical
</p>
<p>understanding of the given class of problems, as manifested in this case within a
</p>
<p>particular context.
</p>
<p>11.4.2 Design and Construction
</p>
<p>The second phase is design and construction, which is a coherent process followed
</p>
<p>and documented to arrive at a (tentative) solution to the problem. Unlike the other
</p>
<p>two main phases which follow empirical cycles based on a research chain of
</p>
<p>reasoning, the microcycle of design and construction resembles that of creating (not
</p>
<p>testing) a conceptual model.
</p>
<p>Design refers to generate potential solutions to the problem, develop draft
</p>
<p>principles to guide the design of the intervention. Construction refers to the process
</p>
<p>of taking design ideas and applying them to actually manufacture the solution. This
</p>
<p>generally takes place through a prototyping approach, where successive approxi-
</p>
<p>mations of the desired solution are (re-)created.
</p>
<p>The results of this phase are a research proposal, which includes details of the
</p>
<p>methodology of the intervention, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed
</p>
<p>solution, as it largely constitutes the data collection and analysis stages of the study.
</p>
<p>From the practical perspective, the intervention is conceived and assembled.
</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, the frameworks underpinning design as well as the
</p>
<p>justification for design decisions are articulated.
</p>
<p>11.4.3 Evaluation and Reflection
</p>
<p>The third phase is evaluation and reflection. Evaluation refers to the empirical
</p>
<p>testing that is done with a design or a constructed intervention (that is, the
</p>
<p>embodiments of design in the initial, partial, or final form).
</p>
<p>Reflection involves active and thoughtful consideration of what has come
</p>
<p>together in both research and development (including theoretical inputs, empirical
</p>
<p>findings, and subjective reactions) with the aim of producing theoretical under-
</p>
<p>standing. Reflection is benefited most when approached through a combination of
</p>
<p>systematic and organic techniques.
</p>
<p>The results of empirical findings, as well as critical reflection are then used to
</p>
<p>accept, refine, or refute the conjectures, frameworks, or principles that are portrayed
</p>
<p>in design documents (e.g., design frameworks) or embodied in actual (prototypes
</p>
<p>of) interventions. McKenney and Reeves (2012) depicted the elements and outcome
</p>
<p>of three phases of DBR in Table 11.1.
</p>
<p>11.4 The Process of Design-Based Research 183</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4.4 Interaction with Practice: Implementation and Spread
</p>
<p>The three core processes (analysis and exploration; design and construction; and
</p>
<p>evaluation and reflection) are interacting with practice through the (anticipation of)
</p>
<p>implementation and spread of interventions.
</p>
<p>Researchers and practitioners jointly anticipate and plan for it from the very first
</p>
<p>stage of analysis and exploration, e.g., by tempering idealist goals with realistic
</p>
<p>assessments of what is possible; by taking practitioner concerns seriously; and by
</p>
<p>studying what intrinsic motives and natural opportunities are already present in the
</p>
<p>target setting.
</p>
<p>This can include many kinds of professionals whose work relates to educational
</p>
<p>practice, such as teachers, administrators, teacher educators, examination agencies,
</p>
<p>inspectorates, policy makers, and textbook publishers. During analysis and explo-
</p>
<p>ration, this involvement is geared primarily toward clarifying the problem and
</p>
<p>shaping and understanding of constraints within which design will have to operate.

<p>11.4.5 Two Main Outputs
</p>
<p>In design-based research generic model, there are two main outputs: maturing
</p>
<p>interventions and theoretical understanding. Both outputs ripen over time and can
</p>
<p>be more locally relevant or more broadly applicable.
</p>
<p>The intervention itself contributes directly to practice (by addressing the problem
</p>
<p>at hand) and indirectly to theoretical understanding (as one example of how
</p>
<p>specific, articulated, design frameworks can be reified). The theoretical under-
</p>
<p>standing is produced through (usually several) micro and/or mesocycles of design
</p>
<p>research.
</p>
<p>The empirical findings and resulting conjectures provide important building
</p>
<p>blocks for theory, and can also contribute indirectly to practice as these ideas may
</p>
<p>be shared among professionals and used to build new interventions.
</p>
<p>11.5 Dbr and Traditional Empirical Research
</p>
<p>Reeves (2006) draws a clear line between research conducted with traditional
</p>
<p>empirical goals and that inspired by development goals leading to &ldquo;design princi-
</p>
<p>ples,&rdquo; as shown in Fig. 11.2.
</p>
<p>The traditional empirical research proposed the hypotheses based on observation
</p>
<p>and existing theories, which is tested by the design experiment. Then, the theory is
</p>
<p>refined based on the test results. Finally, practitioners apply the refinement theory.
</p>
<p>The cycle of traditional empirical research is the specification of new hypotheses.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The design-based research is based on the analysis of practical problems by
</p>
<p>researchers and practitioners in collaboration. Then, combine with the existing
</p>
<p>design principles and technology innovation to develop the solution, test and refine
</p>
<p>solutions iteratively in practice. Last, reflect the implementation of design principles
</p>
<p>and solutions. Design-based research is not for testing hypotheses, but for refining
</p>
<p>of problems, solutions, methods, and design principles.
</p>
<p>11.6 Case Study
</p>
<p>Different research reports are used here to illustrate the variety of educational
</p>
<p>design-based research conducted within the field of educational technology.
</p>
<p>The first case is conducted by Thomas et al. (2009), with substantial funding
</p>
<p>from the National Science Foundation and other sources. He put his efforts to refine
</p>
<p>a theory of transformational play while at the same time seeking to develop
</p>
<p>advanced forms of interactive learning games. It contains three qualitative studies
</p>
<p>focused on the challenges and successes involved in implementing Quest Atlantis, a
</p>
<p>3D multi-player virtual environment (MUVE), which serves as the primary vehicle
</p>
<p>for instantiating Barab&rsquo;s transformational play learning theory and for allowing it to
</p>
<p>be refined through iterative design-based research.
</p>
<p>The second case is co-led by an at-the-time early career assistant professor,
</p>
<p>Klopfer and Squire (2008), with start-up funding from Microsoft and other sources.
</p>
<p>It is a multi-year project to enhance student learning related to environmental
</p>
<p>science through the development and refinement of learning games that are
</p>
<p>accessed with handheld devices such as PDAs and smart phones. In addition to
</p>
<p>developing an array of learning games, the project has sought to develop and refine
</p>
<p>a theoretical framework called &ldquo;augmented reality educational gaming&rdquo; that can be
</p>
<p>applied by other game designers. Meanwhile, it focuses on iterative design cycles
</p>
<p>based on five case studies conducted in real high school classrooms.
</p>
<p>The third case is carried out by Oh (2011), working with one other doctoral
</p>
<p>student and a practitioner with no funding beyond a graduate teaching assis-
</p>
<p>tantship. It pursued two primary goals: (1) optimizing collaborative group work in
</p>
<p>an online graduate-level course focused on &ldquo;E-Learning Evaluation,&rdquo; and (2) de-
</p>
<p>veloping a refined model of group work in online courses and identifying design
</p>
<p>principles for supporting online collaborative group work among adult learners. Oh
</p>
<p>use mixed methods to apply across several semester-length iterations of an online
</p>
<p>course to yield multiple distinct design principles for supporting group work by
</p>
<p>adults.
</p>
<p>For each case, the problem addressed, the primary focus of the research, the
</p>
<p>intervention that was developed, the theoretical contributions, the methods used,
</p>
<p>and the scope of the intervention involved as well as its practical contribution are
</p>
<p>summarized in Table 11.2.

<p>12.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Design methodology is a powerful methodology for problem-forming and
</p>
<p>problem-solving which integrates human, business, and technological factors.
</p>
<p>Each designer wishes to work out preferable design; however, the innovative
</p>
<p>and practical products among the numerous products are just a rarity of the rarities.
</p>
<p>Designers need a thinking tool to help them master demands, develop divergent
</p>
<p>thinking, and arrange for product structure. Besides, they also need a design flow to
</p>
<p>make the design work structuralized, achieve a stable output, and improve work
</p>
<p>efficiency without omitting elements; they also need a work specification to accu-
</p>
<p>mulate and ensure quality and to coordinate between different designers.
</p>
<p>In fact, according to the design characteristics of products, different industries
</p>
<p>have their own methodologies. For example, home furnishing design and graphic
</p>
<p>design have the universal design methods of the industry, to support for their design
</p>
<p>process. So does the Internet industry; during the Internet development history of
</p>
<p>more than 20 years, various companies form their respective design methods
</p>
<p>suitable for their respective demands.
</p>
<p>The design methodology in this chapter summarizes the design experiences of
</p>
<p>various successful products and is the combination of experiences and skills
</p>
<p>extracted from multiple design works (including building design, industrial design,
</p>
<p>software design, and game design).
</p>
<p>It is not only a kind of design thinking but also a set of feasible design flow, a
</p>
<p>complete and overall work specification. The design methodology guides designers
</p>
<p>to utilize the divergent thinking of the fragmentation and the method of exhaustion,
</p>
<p>to start from original demands, to conduct in-depth analysis on various design
</p>
<p>elements such as target user, stakeholders, competitive products, and scenes, and
</p>
<p>then screen, optimize, and output product functions and prototypes.
</p>
<p>As a kind of thinking tool, the design methodology is applied to any design type
</p>
<p>work, including game designer, software designer, UI designer, management per-
</p>
<p>sonnel, or even administrative assistant. After the in-depth learning of methodol-
</p>
<p>ogy, they can master user demands, use scene, user pain spots during actual works,
</p>
<p>to work out better product or service.
</p>
<p>12.2 The Framework of Design Methodology
</p>
<p>Figure 12.1 depicts the framework of design methodology. Firstly, design
</p>
<p>methodology based on original requirements, that is, there is a problem that needs
</p>
<p>to solve. The designers will analyze the target users related to this problem (or
</p>
<p>original demand), identify the characteristics of the target users from various
</p>
<p>dimensions, find out the stakeholders (broadly conceived to include learners,
</p>
<p>teachers, support personnel, and administrators) and their corresponding interests
</p>
<p>190 12 Design Methodology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>relevant to this problem. After analyzing the target users&rsquo; demands and interests of
</p>
<p>the stakeholders, the designers can diversify, select, and improve their designs.
</p>
<p>Next, specific to a particular industry and the potential product(s), designers will
</p>
<p>perform &ldquo;competitive product analysis&rdquo; and &ldquo;scenario analysis&rdquo; based on the
</p>
<p>original demand, which includes learning if there is any ready-made solution and
</p>
<p>what its vulnerabilities are and what can be improved. On the strength of the
</p>
<p>preliminary design, designers will build users&rsquo; daily (no solutions) behavior sce-
</p>
<p>narios, mine user pain points, construct the various product application scenarios. In
</p>
<p>such a concrete process, the design is constantly improved to perfection.
</p>
<p>Based on a full analysis of these aspects, designers will integrate a function list,
</p>
<p>or preliminary solution plan list aiming at the original demand. Finally, based on the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;function list&rdquo; and the original demand, the designers refer to the original demands
</p>
<p>again, consider the design purpose, and select the most proper and feasible solution
</p>
<p>to this demand.
</p>
<p>No matter what solution plan it is, as a designer, you should never forget to ask
</p>
<p>yourself: What kind of value does my solution plan (which can also be called the
</p>
<p>product) create for the user? Or what is the value proposition of this product? The
</p>
<p>whole process is a design process of focusing on problems, diverging problems, and
</p>
<p>focusing on problems again. Under the ideal circumstances, this design process is a
</p>
<p>continuous, repeated, and endless problem-solving process. When thought of in this
</p>
<p>manner, design research is a kind of specialized formative evaluation effort.

<p>12.3 Original Requirements Analysis
</p>
<p>12.3.1 Introduction to Original Requirements Analysis
</p>
<p>Original requirements refer to the unprocessed requirements or demands proposed
</p>
<p>by the originator at the launching stage of the project. It is the truthful description of
</p>
<p>the originator and product design requirements; it usually does not need
</p>
<p>modification.
</p>
<p>Original requirements are the basis to direct designers to develop the design of
</p>
<p>products, and the scale to test whether the design complies with requirements. In the
</p>
<p>product design of designers, there is usually key information of each item that needs
</p>
<p>to be confirmed with the requirement originator, the proposition of the original
</p>
<p>requirement concept excellently solves the common problems such as the insuffi-
</p>
<p>ciency of communication and lack of information in design. Meanwhile, the
</p>
<p>original requirement marks the product expectation and design boundary and other
</p>
<p>contents of the original requirement, which is important and necessary for
</p>
<p>designers.
</p>
<p>12.3.2 General Process of Original Requirements Analysis
</p>
<p>Original requirements refer to the unprocessed needs or demands that are raised by
</p>
<p>the demand side in the beginning stage of the project.
</p>
<p>&bull; Step 1: Obtain the original needs
</p>
<p>&bull; Step 2: Systemize the original needs
</p>
<p>&bull; Step 3: Extract the original needs
</p>
<p>&bull; Step 4: Confirm the original needs
</p>
<p>Original requirements usually are the unprocessed requirements acquired after a
</p>
<p>series of materials collection, and these materials can be research results or maybe
</p>
<p>meeting recordings, or the very words proposed directly by the originator. After
</p>
<p>acquiring the material list from the originator, the designer abstracts typically all
</p>
<p>unprocessed information one on one from the materials and come up with a copy of
</p>
<p>complete and structural original requirements and then deliver to the originator for
</p>
<p>signing and confirmation. After the originator confirms, the original requirements
</p>
<p>will be used as the direct basis for the subsequent product design.
</p>
<p>The original requirement is presented in a structured way, which the designer
</p>
<p>needs to abstract the information of every structure element from the product design
</p>
<p>requirement given by the requirement demand side.
</p>
<p>Original requirements elements include originator, project name, required
</p>
<p>material list, original requirements description, target user, design purpose, using
</p>

<p>scenario, time requirement, product form, priority adapting platform, signing and

<p>12.3.3 The Websoft Case
</p>
<p>The chairman of the Websoft Company held a meeting with its CTO (Chief
</p>
<p>Technology Officer) to discuss the eye protection function of the student tablet.
</p>
<p>They determined what modules of functions this product should have, which
</p>
<p>aspects of design need more attention, and other core contents.
</p>
<p>After receiving the meeting recording, the designer analyzed and generated the
</p>
<p>information structuralized of the meeting recording into a piece of the original
</p>
<p>requirement table, as shown in Table 12.2.

<p>12.4 Target User Analysis
</p>
<p>12.4.1 Introduction to Target User Analysis
</p>
<p>A target user is the intended audience or readership of publication, advertisement,
</p>
<p>or other messages. In marketing and advertising, it is a particular group of con-
</p>
<p>sumers within the predetermined target market, identified as the targets or recipients
</p>
<p>for a particular advertisement or message.
</p>
<p>In product design, users of different ages, genders, and education may have
</p>
<p>different ideas on the same product and its operation. Therefore, in the process of
</p>
<p>product design, we should fully consider the users&rsquo; various characteristics. Through
</p>
<p>target users&rsquo; analysis, we can make clear the target groups of product and their
</p>
<p>needs. Analysis results for characteristics of users can be used as one of the bases to
</p>
<p>determine the direction of our product design and priority of requirements.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The function of the target user analysis includes the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Clarify for whom the product is designed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify users&rsquo; motive behind the needs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a basis for prioritizing the product function design.
</p>
<p>12.4.2 The General Process of Target User Analysis
</p>
<p>The procedure of the target user analysis includes the following steps:
</p>
<p>&bull; Step 1: Analyze the target user according to the attribute tags listed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Step 2: Describe the attribute tags that may influence the product design and
</p>
<p>clarify the specific presentation of such an attribute tag.
</p>
<p>&bull; Step 3: Extract the design inspiration from the attribute description.
</p>
<p>The attribute of the target user refers to the typical characteristics of the product
</p>
<p>users. Such attributes usually cover personal information, economy, culture, com-
</p>
<p>munity, hardware, software, characteristic, etc. Characteristic attribute refers to the
</p>
<p>values that the target user can generate for the design, which includes psychological
</p>
<p>characteristic attribute and behavior characteristic attribute.
</p>
<p>There are many ways to analyze users, including interviews, live tracking,
</p>
<p>user-related personnel research, life experience simulation, viewing user analysis
</p>
<p>report on professional Web sites, reading books for relevant groups written by
</p>
<p>professionals and so on. One of the most common ways is to view online relevant
</p>
<p>information.

<p>Through these methods, we can understand target users more practically to
</p>
<p>extract accurately target users&rsquo; attribute tags and prevent the designer from spec-
</p>
<p>ulating target user characteristics, to help us to design the product correctly.
</p>
<p>After user analysis, users&rsquo; attribute will be presented clearly in Table 12.3 as
</p>
<p>follows.
</p>
<p>12.4.3 An Example of Target User Analysis
</p>
<p>Following the case in 3.3, the next step is the target user analysis for eye protection
</p>
<p>system, and the product of this analysis is shown in Table 12.4. In this product,
</p>
<p>target users are junior high and high school students, and we analyze their
</p>
<p>requirement features in many aspects, such as personalized requirements, prefer-
</p>
<p>ence culture, game awareness, vanity, self-control, study-induced stress, indepen-
</p>
<p>dent learning ability, mind of rivalry, sharing tendencies, rebellious, intensity with
</p>
<p>eyes, and eyesight protection awareness.

<p>12.5 Stakeholder Analysis
</p>
<p>12.5.1 Introduction of Stakeholder Analysis
</p>
<p>A stakeholder is a person such as an employee, customer, or citizen who is involved
</p>
<p>with an organization, society, etc. and therefore has responsibilities towards it and
</p>
<p>an interest in its success. Kaler (2002) defines stakeholders as those towards whom
</p>
<p>businesses owe moral duties and obligations beyond those generally owed to the
</p>
<p>general public. For example, sponsors, clients, users, partners, authority depart-
</p>
<p>ments, other interested persons, organizations, hardware/software influence, etc.
</p>
<p>Analysis of the stakeholders&rsquo; influence on design will be conducted on the
</p>
<p>following aspects:
</p>
<p>&bull; Clarify the design direction and design boundary.
</p>
<p>&bull; Extract the function needs or design inspiration.
</p>
<p>&bull; Specify the need priority and serve as a basis for judgment when there is any
</p>
<p>confliction.
</p>
<p>12.5.2 The General Process of Stakeholder Analysis
</p>
<p>Stakeholder analysis includes the three steps: to list stakeholders, to analyze the
</p>
<p>stakeholders, and to extract the function demands.
</p>
<p>12.5.2.1 List Stakeholders
To analyze the stakeholders, we need to identify the right stakeholders and ensure
</p>
<p>that no important stakeholders are omitted. The fragmentation method and the
</p>
<p>exhaustive method will serve as the two important methods for identifying important
</p>
<p>stakeholders. We can identify the required stakeholders in the following reference:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying the stakeholders from the main product scenario or customer
</p>
<p>process.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying the stakeholders in the product life circle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying stakeholders by searching the keywords.
</p>
<p>12.5.2.2 Analyze the Stakeholders
The stakeholders involved in a product are multiple. We can identify and categorize
</p>
<p>the stakeholders and determine the roles they are playing in a project so that we can
</p>
<p>catch a structured and logic analysis of the stakeholders.
</p>
<p>12.5 Stakeholder Analysis 197</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>We will classify the stakeholders in several main dimensions such as the con-
</p>
<p>tributor, the customer, the user, the authority department, the partner, other parties
</p>
<p>interested (software and hardware shall also be considered in certain cases).
</p>
<p>Then, we will determine the importance of stakeholders through identifying the
</p>
<p>demands, expectations, contributions, functions of the stakeholders on the program,
</p>
<p>and prioritize the stakeholders based on their power, influence, attitude, urgency.
</p>
<p>Last, we will analyze stakeholders&rsquo; interest and demands.
</p>
<p>12.5.2.3 Extract the Function Demands
Based on the analysis of the stakeholders&rsquo; project interests, negative impact,
</p>
<p>expectations/requirements, and objectives/motivation, we can identify the stake-
</p>
<p>holder&rsquo;s pain points and quick points, get inspirations, and provide the basis for
</p>
<p>product design.
</p>
<p>Design inspiration can be product use scenario, product function, or certain
</p>
<p>characteristics, etc. At this stage, the content of the design is entirely kept to extract
</p>
<p>a variety of feasible solutions.
</p>
<p>After stakeholder analysis, some elements will be presented clearly in
</p>
<p>Table 12.5 as follows.
</p>
<p>12.5.3 An Example of Stakeholder Analysis
</p>
<p>Based on the analysis on the stakeholders&rsquo; project interests, negative impact,
</p>
<p>expectations/requirements, and objectives/motivation, we can identify the stake-
</p>
<p>holder&rsquo;s pain points and quick points, get inspirations, and provide the basis for
</p>
<p>product design. Table 12.6 is an example of design inspiration from analyzing main
</p>
<p>stakeholders of the takeout platform.

<p>12.6 Competitor Analysis
</p>
<p>12.6.1 Introduction to Competitor Analysis
</p>
<p>Competitors are defined asfirmsofferingproducts or services that are close substitutes,
</p>
<p>in the sense that they serve the same customer need (Porter, 1980; Kotler, 2000).

<p>12.6 Competitor Analysis 199</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Competitive product analysis, in essence, is a &ldquo;comparative study&rdquo; originating
</p>
<p>from anthropology. It is a qualitative research method that studies user behavior.
</p>
<p>Firstly, it requires finding out the similar phenomenon or things; secondly, the same
</p>
<p>phenomena or things are grouped and tabled for comparison; thirdly, conduct
</p>
<p>further analysis on the comparing results. Its main purpose is to provide references
</p>
<p>on functionality, usability, key technologies for product design, to help designers to
</p>
<p>explore the core demands of the target users, and learn how competitive products
</p>
<p>meet the requirements of the target users.
</p>
<p>There are three types of competitors:
</p>
<p>&bull; Competitors with identical functions: products that can perform the same function
</p>
<p>with the target product, and are highly correspondent to the original needs and on
</p>
<p>the same platform with the target product (Web, desktop, mobile terminal).
</p>
<p>&bull; Competitors with similar core functions: products that can perform the same or
</p>
<p>similar function with the target product, and are highly correspondent to the
</p>
<p>original needs and on the same platform with the target product (Web, desktop,
</p>
<p>mobile terminal).
</p>
<p>&bull; Competitors with the same-essence function: competitive products that have
</p>
<p>different realizing channels or forms but can perform the same function with the
</p>
<p>target product. Such products are usually goods or services with reference values.
</p>
<p>12.6.2 General Process of Competitor Analysis
</p>
<p>Competitive product analysis includes the following process, as shown in Fig. 12.2:
</p>
<p>(1) Competitive products collection: Collect competitive products as many as
</p>
<p>possible through all available channels;
</p>
<p>(2) Competitive products selection: Classify and select the core competitive
</p>
<p>products worthy of reference from the available competitive products;
</p>
<p>(3) Competitive products dismantling and function integration: Dismantle and
</p>
<p>analyze the core competitive products to understand the motivation behind the
</p>
<p>design function of competitive products. Identify the excellent design and
</p>
<p>integrate it into their products.
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.2 Process of competitor analysis
</p>
<p>200 12 Design Methodology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.6.2.1 Competitive Product Collection
Competitive product collection refers to the process to get more referential products
</p>
<p>through various methods. Analysis of competitive products can contribute to our
</p>
<p>product design. Under the premise to stick to the core demands of the target user,
</p>
<p>find more things that can meet the core demands.
</p>
<p>Take chat apps as an example. Its core demand is to satisfy the communication
</p>
<p>demands between people. In addition to QQ, WeChat, Skype, telephone, SMS,
</p>
<p>e-mail, and even sign language can be used to meet the users&rsquo; communication
</p>
<p>demands. Therefore, these products are listed in our competitive products.
</p>
<p>Competitive products collecting method is as follows:
</p>
<p>(1) Find the right competitive products from app market, professional Web sites,
</p>
<p>and industrial investigation reports;
</p>
<p>(2) Use a search engine, such as Google, Baidu, and Yahoo to find the right
</p>
<p>competitive products;
</p>
<p>(3) User interview: interview the target users to find the right competitive
</p>
<p>products;
</p>
<p>(4) Think if there are any other ways to realize the core functions, such as
</p>
<p>products of the software, materials, services;
</p>
<p>(5) Expand part of the functions: Certain functions can be enlarged to find the
</p>
<p>right competitive products, such as expanding from buying cinema tickets to
</p>
<p>buying tickets
</p>
<p>(6) Other industries: Analyze how other industries make achievements. For
</p>
<p>example, consider how the financial industry achieves success when devel-
</p>
<p>oping a calculator for the education industry.
</p>
<p>(7) Others: through fragmentation and operation related method to find compet-
</p>
<p>itive products.
</p>
<p>(8) Extract keywords based on the key stakeholder analysis and then collect
</p>
<p>competitive products.
</p>
<p>12.6.2.2 Competitive Products Selection
In the actual work, we divide the selected competitive product into three categories
</p>
<p>based on the product functions, match degree, and realization method. In principle,
</p>
<p>all competitive products can be classified into one of the three categories:
</p>
<p>Competitive products with the same functions: Competitive products are those
</p>
<p>which can reach the desired targets and share the same platform (Web, desktop,
</p>
<p>mobile terminal) with our designed software.
</p>
<p>Competitive products with similar functions: Competitive products are those
</p>
<p>which have the same or similar functions and part of their functions conforms to the
</p>
<p>requirements and shares a different platform (Web, desktop, mobile terminal) with
</p>
<p>our designed software.
</p>
<p>Competitive products which have essentially the same function: referring to
</p>
<p>competitive products that have different realizing channels or forms but can perform
</p>
<p>the same function with the target product. Such products are usually goods or
</p>
<p>services with reference values.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.6.2.3 Competitive Product Dismantling
Competitive product dismantling is to dismantle competitive products in a frag-
</p>
<p>mentation manner. In simple terms, it is to experience competitive products, get the
</p>
<p>functions, record the whole process, and make notes for the contents displayed
</p>
<p>through the dismantling template.
</p>
<p>We divide the dismantling into three steps: select competitive products to be
</p>
<p>dismantled, dismantle competitive products, label dismantling method and add
</p>
<p>function notes.
</p>
<p>12.6.2.4 Competitive Product Function Integration
Competitive product function integration refers to the collection and integration of
</p>
<p>all the functions of the disassembled competitive product, and the marking of the
</p>
<p>importance degree of each of them by analysis.
</p>
<p>After the disassembly of all competitive products, integrate functions of each
</p>
<p>competitive product according to &ldquo;List for Disassembly of Competitive Products.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, three levels are reserved for each competitive product: func-
</p>
<p>tional modules, the first level of functions and the second level of functions, and the
</p>
<p>&ldquo;List for Functional Integration of Competitive Products,&rdquo; formed finally.
</p>
<p>After competitor analysis, competitive products selection will be presented in
</p>
<p>Table 12.7, and competitive products functions disassembly will be presented
</p>
<p>clearly in Table 12.8.

<p>12.7 Scenario Analysis
</p>
<p>12.7.1 Introduction of Scenario Analysis
</p>
<p>Scenario refers to the situation which the user may encounter in using or getting in
</p>
<p>touch with the products, including the operation process and feelings.
</p>
<p>Scenario analysis is a process of analyzing possible future events by considering
</p>
<p>alternative possible outcomes (sometimes called &ldquo;alternative worlds&rdquo;). Thus, the
</p>
<p>scenario analysis, which is a main method of projections, does not try to show one
</p>
<p>exact picture of the future. Instead, it presents consciously several alternative future
</p>
<p>developments.
</p>
<p>12.7.2 General Process of Scenario Analysis
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the flow of scenario analysis is as follows:
</p>
<p>Firstly, it is the listing of elements, and the thinking mode of exhaustion shall be
</p>
<p>utilized to try to list all the elements related to the product; scenario elements may
</p>
<p>include time, place, participants, cause, process, tools, application conditions, etc.
</p>
<p>Secondly, combine elements one by one according to the listed scenario ele-
</p>
<p>ments, to describe a general situation of the scenario.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, conduct scenario description, i.e., show the behavioral process of users
</p>
<p>with clear, detailed, and careful flow description. After the process of scenario title
</p>
<p>and scenario description, we need to mine and summarize pain points and pleasant
</p>
<p>points of users.
</p>
<p>Finally, aiming at the detected user pain points or pleasant points, we shall give
</p>
<p>corresponding functions or solutions. The whole flow is summarized as five pro-
</p>
<p>cedures: list of elements, scenario title, scenario description, seeking pain
</p>
<p>point/pleasant points, and giving solutions, as shown in Fig. 12.3.
</p>
<p>After scenario analysis, some elements will be presented clearly in Tables 12.9
</p>
<p>and 12.10 as follows:

<p>12.8 Function List
</p>
<p>12.8.1 Introduction to the Function List
</p>
<p>Function list is the integration of functions that is designed to satisfy certain
</p>
<p>demands, which also includes the correlation, level of importance, and remarks of
</p>
<p>the functions. It may be the documents that contain tables, mind maps that can
</p>
<p>display the relationship between functions.

<p>204 12 Design Methodology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In &ldquo;Design Methodology,&rdquo; it is needed to take competitive product function
</p>
<p>integration result as the framework and blueprint on the basis of considering the
</p>
<p>core value of the product and acquiring the basic structure of the product, and in
</p>
<p>combination of the functions acquired from the nodes such as original demand,
</p>
<p>analysis on stakeholder, analysis on target users, scenario analysis, to form the
</p>
<p>product function list.
</p>
<p>12.8.2 The General Process of Function List
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the output of the function list contains the following
</p>
<p>procedures:
</p>
<p>(1) Reinspect the original demand and sort out the preliminary list
</p>
<p>(2) Expand the optional schemes and conduct self-inspection to function list
</p>
<p>(3) Make clear the core functions and classify and sort out functions
</p>
<p>(4) Conduct screening on function list and rank for function priority
</p>
<p>(5) Supplement function description and check on function list
</p>
<p>The above procedures can be divided into function integration and function list
</p>
<p>manufacture:
</p>
<p>(1) Function integration is conducted in order to maximize the optional schemes,
</p>
<p>and it is necessary for the designers to think about the type of functions, the
</p>
<p>origin of them, and the arrangement structure of them;
</p>
<p>(2) Function list manufacture is the procedure for the determination of the final
</p>
<p>solution, and it is necessary for designers to think of what functions shall be
</p>
<p>reserved, and what functions are important, and whether the functions are
</p>
<p>clearly described, etc.
</p>
<p>For the final function list, the following procedures could be followed to finish
</p>
<p>the function list worksheet in Table 12.11.
</p>
<p>(1) Step 1: Trim functions. Function classification is to classify all the functions of
</p>
<p>a product, clarifying the function modules, eliminating or correcting the
</p>
<p>unnecessary functions, etc.
</p>
<p>(2) Step 2: Mark the level of importance. The level of importance for the product
</p>
<p>functions can be divided into four categories: necessary, suggested, better
</p>
<p>with, and not suggested. Evaluate the design satisfaction level of the product
</p>
<p>based on the review of original needs and analyses of stakeholders, com-
</p>
<p>petitors, and scenarios. Assume the first version of WhatsApp is to be
</p>
<p>developed, the necessary functions include registration (bound to phone
</p>
<p>numbers), dialogue, communication by phones while the suggested functions
</p>
<p>include portrait, iCloud backup, broadcast, groups, message-receiving
</p>
<p>confirmation.
</p>
<p>12.8 Function List 205</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>(3) Step 3: Remarks. Enter the reflections on the functions and solutions,
</p>
<p>including any items deemed to be specified by the designer
</p>
<p>12.8.3 An Example of Function List
</p>
<p>The function list for eye use protective system is shown in Appendix 6.
</p>
<p>12.9 Extended Reading
</p>
<p>Approaches to delivering design methodology vary in terminology and phases of
</p>
<p>execution. The UK design council illustrates a four-stage process: discover, define,
</p>
<p>develop, and deliver termed the &ldquo;Double Diamond&rdquo; (Design Council, 2005),
</p>
<p>whereas innovation consultancy IDEO (Brown, 2008) proposes the approach
</p>
<p>incorporating three spaces: inspiration, ideation, and implementation.
</p>
<p>12.9.1 Double Diamond
</p>
<p>This double diverge-converge pattern was first introduced in 2005 by the British
</p>
<p>Design Council (Design Council UK, 2005), which called it the double diamond
</p>
<p>design process model. The Design Council divided the design process into four
</p>
<p>stages: &ldquo;discover&rdquo; and &ldquo;define&rdquo;&mdash;for the divergence and convergence phases of
</p>
<p>finding the right problem, and &ldquo;develop&rdquo; and &ldquo;deliver&rdquo;&mdash;for the divergence and
</p>
<p>convergence phases of finding the right solution.
</p>
<p>12.9.2 Design Thinking for Educators (IDEO)
</p>
<p>IDEO (pronounced &ldquo;eye-dee-oh&rdquo;) is an international design and consulting firm
</p>
<p>founded in Palo Alto, California, in 1991. The company uses the design thinking
</p>

<p>206 12 Design Methodology</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>methodology to design products, services, environments, and digital experiences.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the company has become increasingly involved in management
</p>
<p>consulting and organizational design.
</p>
<p>The design process is what puts design thinking into action. It is a structured
</p>
<p>approach to generating and evolving ideas. It has five phases that help navigate the
</p>
<p>development from identifying a design challenge to finding and building a solution,
</p>
<p>which contains discovery, interpretation, ideation, experimentation, and evolution.
</p>
<p>It is a deeply human approach that relies on your ability to be intuitive, to
</p>
<p>interpret what you observe and to develop ideas that are emotionally meaningful to
</p>
<p>those you are designing for&mdash;all skills you are well-versed in as an educator.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) Design methodology is a powerful methodology for innovation has emerged,
</p>
<p>which integrates human, business, and technological factors in
</p>
<p>problem-forming, solving, and design
</p>
<p>(2) The framework of design methodology: First, design methodology is based on
</p>
<p>original requirements or problems; then designers will perform &ldquo;competitive
</p>
<p>product analysis,&rdquo; &ldquo;scenario analysis,&rdquo; &ldquo;target user analysis,&rdquo; &ldquo;stakeholder
</p>
<p>analysis&rdquo; based on the original demand; after that, designers will integrate a
</p>
<p>function list; finally, designers will select the most proper and feasible solution
</p>
<p>to the demand.

<p>Scenario title
</p>
<p>1 Student B cannot help getting closer when using the tablet computer, and Parent C
</p>
<p>wishes that friend reminding can be given to children when they use tablet
</p>
<p>computer in an incorrect way
</p>
<p>2 When reading books, Student A with shortsightedness is worried about the wrong
</p>
<p>sight distance
</p>
<p>3 Student B is worried about the short sight distance during learning, and he adjusts
</p>
<p>eyes with distance with textbook with comfortable sight distance
</p>
<p>4 [Competitive product scenario] Student B customizes the sight distance with 101
</p>
<p>schoolmate party and is not sure if the distance he sets is reasonable
</p>
<p>5 [Competitive product scenario] Student B tests on sight distance with 101
</p>
<p>schoolmate party, and the screen turns off before the end of the test
</p>
<p>6 [Competitive product scenario] Student B wants to recover to default reminding
</p>
<p>sight distance because he has changed the sight distance for several times when
</p>
<p>using 101 schoolmate party, but feels uncomfortable
</p>
<p>7 Student B revises lessons at home until feeling eyes sore to take some rest
</p>
<p>8 On the way to school in the afternoon, Student B opens the mobile phone and
</p>
<p>checks for new information, but he cannot see clearly under sunshine
</p>
<p>9 Student B suddenly wakes up during mid-night and opens the IPAD to see the time
</p>
<p>10 [Competitive product scenario] Student B wants to test sight distance with 101
</p>
<p>schoolmate party and has no idea about the concept of the sight distance of more
</p>
<p>than 1700

<p>2 1. When reading books, the shortsighted
</p>
<p>Student A starts to pay attention to eye
</p>
<p>protection to avoid sight drop
</p>
<p>2. A learns that the sight distance from
</p>
<p>eyes to books shall be 1&ndash;1.5 chi length
</p>
<p>and estimates the sight distance
</p>
<p>3. But A is worried about his sight
</p>
<p>distance is not accurate, and he often
</p>
<p>gets closer after reading for a while, and
</p>
<p>he has no idea. (pain point)
</p>
<p>Sight distance detection;
</p>
<p>Sight distance reminding
</p>
<p>3 1. Student B is worried about the
</p>
<p>damage to his eyes with short sight
</p>
<p>distance
</p>
<p>2. B sets the comfortable and clear sight
</p>
<p>distance for himself, and adjusts the
</p>
<p>distance, and he feels more comfortable
</p>
<p>than before. (pleasant point)
</p>
<p>Customized sight distance
</p>
<p>4 1. Student B moves the screen several
</p>
<p>times when he uses the 101 school party
</p>
<p>and customizes the sight distance, to
</p>
<p>adjust to a suitable range
</p>
<p>2. But the system does not give the
</p>
<p>reminding that this is within the
</p>
<p>scientific range, and B is not sure if the
</p>
<p>sight distance he sets is reasonable, and
</p>
<p>he is confused.
</p>
<p>5 1. The shortsighted Student A adjusts
</p>
<p>the distance to see if he can see clearly
</p>
<p>when he was measuring sight distance
</p>
<p>with the schoolmate party
</p>
<p>2. However, later, the screen turns down
</p>
<p>before the end of the test. A is troubled
</p>
<p>to unlock the screen and make it turn on
</p>
<p>again. (pain point)
</p>
<p>Measurement of sight distance
</p>
<p>forbidding of screen sleeping
</p>
<p>6 1. Student B changes the sight distance
</p>
<p>for several times when he uses the 101
</p>
<p>schoolmate party, and wants to find out
</p>
<p>the sight distance suitable for him
</p>
<p>2. But B cannot find out the suitable
</p>
<p>sight distance after several times of
</p>
<p>modification, and he wants to recover to
</p>
<p>the default reminding sight distance
</p>
<p>3. But the system does not provide the
</p>
<p>option of recovering to the default
</p>
<p>value; B is confused and has no idea
</p>
<p>about the ideal sight distance. (pain
</p>
<p>point)

</p>
<p>home and he feels eyes sore later, and a
</p>
<p>lot of time has passed
</p>
<p>3. Therefore, B has to stop and have
</p>
<p>some rest. He thinks that it is necessary
</p>
<p>to have somebody remind of him about
</p>
<p>the reading time. (pain point)
</p>
<p>Duration reminding
</p>
<p>8 1. Student B goes to school in the
</p>
<p>afternoon, and there is a reminding of a
</p>
<p>new message from his mobile phone in
</p>
<p>the pocket, and B takes out the mobile
</p>
<p>phone to check
</p>
<p>2. It is a sunny day, and B finds that the
</p>
<p>sunshine is too dazzling, and he can see
</p>
<p>nothing. Therefore, he still looks at the
</p>
<p>screen and finds his eyes sore (pain
</p>
<p>point)
</p>
<p>3. B is helpless and has to run to the
</p>
<p>place without direct sunshine and sees
</p>
<p>clearly
</p>
<p>Environment light detection: high light
</p>
<p>protection
</p>
<p>9 1. Student B wakes up suddenly at
</p>
<p>midnight, and it is still dark outside.
</p>
<p>B wants to see the time, and opens the
</p>
<p>IPAD to see the time
</p>
<p>2. When the screen turns on, B cannot
</p>
<p>open his eyes because of the strong light
</p>
<p>(pain point)
</p>
<p>Environment light detection: low light
</p>
<p>protection
</p>
<p>10 1. Student B measures the sight distance
</p>
<p>with the 101 schoolmate party, and the
</p>
<p>system gives the sight distance of more
</p>
<p>than 1700 for reference
</p>
<p>2. But B, who has poor mathematics
</p>
<p>scores, cannot understand the concept of
</p>
<p>the sight distance of more than 1700. He
</p>
<p>is at a loss
</p>
<p>30&ndash;40CM
</p>
<p>Sight distance: materialized concept of
</p>
<p>length
</p>
<p>(e.g., the distance of a 30&ndash;40-cm ruler;
</p>
<p>keeping a fist distance between the
</p>
<p>upper body and the desk)

<p>13.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>It is obviously true that educational technology changes, and that changes are
</p>
<p>happening at an accelerating pace. The challenge is to make effective use of new
</p>
<p>technologies in different learning scenarios in the twenty-first century. In this
</p>
<p>chapter, four kinds of technologies will be discussed: learning analytics, artificial
</p>
<p>intelligence, adaptive technologies, and wearable devices. These chosen technolo-
</p>
<p>gies in each of these four areas are changing and likely to continue to change and
</p>
<p>evolve for some time. It should be noticed that a technology need not be a specific
</p>
<p>device, as a technology could be generally understood to be a systematic and
</p>
<p>disciplined application of knowledge. Implementation issues and the likely impact
</p>
<p>on learning and instruction of these emerging technologies are also addressed in this
</p>
<p>chapter.
</p>
<p>13.2 Emerging Technologies
</p>
<p>Technologies have changed and continue to change education. For example, social
</p>
<p>networking and digital conferencing have helped improve student&ndash;teacher and
</p>
<p>student&ndash;student relationships and collaborative learning in some cases. Digital
</p>
<p>game technologies and interactive simulations have also helped make some
</p>
<p>learning situations more effective and engaged. In this chapter, we focus on the four
</p>
<p>kinds of technologies that have demonstrated their potentials to improve learning
</p>
<p>and instruction: learning analytics, artificial intelligence, wearable devices, and
</p>
<p>adaptive learning.
</p>
<p>13.2.1 Learning Analytics
</p>
<p>In some sectors, the relatively recent emergence of big data and analytics is now
</p>
<p>viewed as having the potential to transform economies and increase organizational
</p>
<p>productivity (Manyika et al., 2011). Learning analytics is the measurement, col-
</p>
<p>lection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts for under-
</p>
<p>standing and optimizing learning and the environments in which learning occurs (see
</p>
<p>https://tekri.athabascau.ca/analytics/). Unfortunately, educational systems&mdash;pri-
</p>
<p>mary, secondary, and postsecondary&mdash;have made limited use of the available data to
</p>
<p>improve teaching, learning, and learner success. Despite the field of education
</p>
<p>lagging behind other sectors, there has been an explosion of interest in analytics as a
</p>
<p>solution for many current challenges, such as retention and learner support (Siemens,
</p>
<p>2013). For example, a learning dashboard (see https://www.khanacademy.org/about/
</p>
<p>blog/post/58354379257/introducing-the-learning-dashboard;) can provide overview
</p>
<p>learning data through data visualization tools much of the software that is currently
</p>
<p>used for learning analytics.

<p>13.2.2 Artificial Intelligence
</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI; also called machine intelligence or MI) is intelligent
</p>
<p>problem-solving behavior displayed by machines in contrast with the natural
</p>
<p>intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science, AI
</p>
<p>research focuses on the study of intelligent agents, which are devices that can
</p>
<p>perceive a situation or environment and take actions that maximize the chance of
</p>
<p>success in attaining a goal, and the goal may be determined by a person or gen-
</p>
<p>erated by a system in the case of higher order AI agents. The traditional problem
</p>
<p>areas of AI research include problem-solving, complex reasoning, knowledge
</p>
<p>extraction and representation, planning, learning new rules and concepts, natural
</p>
<p>language processing, and the ability to move and manipulate objects (Russell &amp;
</p>
<p>Norvig, 2003).
</p>
<p>AI is a branch of computer science that attempts to understand the nature of
</p>
<p>intelligent behavior to design and create devices that perform in ways that are
</p>
<p>similar to how an informed human would perform in that situation. AI research and
</p>
<p>development areas include robotics, spoken language recognition, image recogni-
</p>
<p>tion, natural language processing, and expert systems to support decision making
</p>
<p>and problem solving. Artificial intelligence can simulate the information process of
</p>
<p>human consciousness and thinking. Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence,
</p>
<p>but it can think like people, and it may surpass people&rsquo;s intelligence.
</p>
<p>13.2.3 Wearable Devices
</p>
<p>Wearable technology refers to computer-based devices that can be worn by users,
</p>
<p>taking the form of an accessory such as jewelry, eyewear, or even actual items of
</p>
<p>clothing such as shoes or a jacket. The advantage of wearable technology is that it
</p>
<p>can easily integrate tools to track sleep, movement, location, and social media
</p>
<p>interactions. In the case of Oculus Rift and other VR headsets, wearable devices can
</p>
<p>support virtual realities. There are even new classes of devices that are seamlessly
</p>
<p>integrated with a user&rsquo;s everyday life and movements. New smartwatches from
</p>
<p>Apple, Garmon, Samsung, Sony, and Pebble are already allowing users to check
</p>
<p>e-mails and perform other productive tasks through a small interface. Thanks to the
</p>
<p>quantified-self movement, today&rsquo;s wearables not only track where a person goes,
</p>
<p>what a person does, and how much time spent on doing something, but now what a
</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s aspirations are and when or where those can be accomplished. Some
</p>
<p>popular wearable devices are bracelets such as Huawei Talk Band 2 (see
</p>
<p>http://consumer.huawei.com/en/wearables/talkband-b2/), and Xiaomi Mi Band (see
</p>
<p>https://www.wareable.com/xiaomi/xiaomi-mi-band-review;), which track move-
</p>
<p>ment, exercise, and other health-related activities. There are tremendous implica-
</p>
<p>tions for physical education, nutrition, and health classes in K-12 education.

<p>13.2.4 Adaptive Learning
</p>
<p>Adaptive learning technologies refer to software and online devices and environ-
</p>
<p>ments that adjust to individual needs (Di et al., 2016). The start of the work on
</p>
<p>adaptive and intelligent learning systems is usually traced back to the SCHOLAR
</p>
<p>intelligent tutoring system (see http://scholar.hw.ac.uk/) that offered adaptive
</p>
<p>learning for the topic of the geography of South America (Carbonell, 1970).
</p>
<p>Adaptive learning is a sophisticated, data-driven, and in some cases, nonlinear
</p>
<p>approach to instruction and remediation, adjusting to a learner&rsquo;s interactions and
</p>
<p>demonstrated performance level, and subsequently anticipating what types of
</p>
<p>content and resources learners need at a specific point in time to make progress. In
</p>
<p>this sense, contemporary educational tools are now capable of learning the way
</p>
<p>people learn. Adaptive devices are enabled by machine learning technologies that
</p>
<p>develop a rich profile of the learner including prior knowledge and interests.
</p>
<p>Adaptive devices can adapt to each student&rsquo;s progress and interests and adjust
</p>
<p>content in real time as well as customize exercises appropriate for a specific learner.
</p>
<p>Many educators envision these adaptive platforms as tutors that can provide per-
</p>
<p>sonalized instruction on a large scale. Currently, several systems and platforms
</p>
<p>providing adaptation to users&rsquo; learning styles, cognitive abilities, affective states,
</p>
<p>and the context of the learning have been created (Wang &amp; Wu, 2011; Yang,
</p>
<p>Hwang, &amp; Yang, 2013). In addition, many of the adaptive learning systems that
</p>
<p>incorporate learning styles are based on the notion that matching the learning
</p>
<p>strategies with the learning styles can improve learner performance; examples
</p>
<p>include MANIC (Stern &amp; Woolf, 2000). MANIC is a Web-based instructional
</p>
<p>system which provides lecture-based material. In MANIC, the adaptation is
</p>
<p>achieved by providing different media representations for each learner.
</p>
<p>Diffusion of Innovations (Rogers, 2003)
</p>
<p>Diffusion of innovations is a theory that aims to clarify how, why, and at what
</p>
<p>rate new ideas and technology spread. In Everett Rogers&rsquo;s book Diffusion of
</p>
<p>Innovations, which was first published in 1962 and is now in its fifth edition,
</p>
<p>Rogers claims that diffusion is the process by which an innovation is com-
</p>
<p>municated over time among the participants in a social system. The beginning
</p>
<p>of the Diffusion of Innovations theory is diverse and spanning many
</p>
<p>disciplines.
</p>
<p>Diffusion occurs through a five-step decision-making process. It occurs
</p>
<p>through a series of communication channels over a period of time among the
</p>
<p>members of a similar social system. Rogers&rsquo; five stages (steps): awareness,
</p>
<p>interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption are integral to this theory. Diffusion of
</p>
<p>Innovations has been applied to numerous contexts, such as technology
</p>
<p>promotion with a particularly large impact on the use of technology.

<p>13.3 Issues Involving in Emerging Technologies
</p>
<p>Over the past decade, there has been an emphasis on equal access to information
</p>
<p>and communications technologies. Lack of equal access is often referred to
</p>
<p>regarding a divide between those in developed countries and regions and those in
</p>
<p>less developed countries or between the well-to-do and the poor. To benefit from
</p>
<p>new technologies, one must have access and the means to gain access to the Internet
</p>
<p>and other resources, which is an essential and persistent concern. Other issues
</p>
<p>related to new technologies concern privacy, ethics, and security. In addition to
</p>
<p>these human-oriented issues, there are a number of implementation issues that need
</p>
<p>to be addressed, including accreditation, scalability, sustainability as well as issues
</p>
<p>that are specific to specific regions and cultures (e.g., humor, color, and examples
</p>
<p>do not always work well in different cultural contexts).
</p>
<p>13.3.1 Ethical, Security and Privacy Issues
</p>
<p>Ethical, security, and privacy issues cover a family of things that have importance
</p>
<p>in everyday life. Ethics in technology is a sub-field of ethics addressing the ethical
</p>
<p>questions specific to the use of technology to support learning and instruction. The
</p>
<p>ethics involved in the development of new technology&mdash;whether it is always, never,
</p>
<p>or contextually right or wrong to invent and implement a technological innovation.
</p>
<p>Ethics relates to the question of what is right or wrong regarding technology use in
</p>
<p>learning. Spector (2005) proposed an educratic oath for educators, and the first part
</p>
<p>of that oath is to do no harm to learners. Disadvantaging some learners when using
</p>
<p>technology can widen the digital divide and is a violation of that principle.
</p>
<p>Security is a key to technology use in education. The use of student data is
</p>
<p>crucial for personalized learning and continuous improvement, but using student
</p>
<p>data to create security issues. Security, acting as the stewards of student data,
</p>
<p>presents educators with several responsibilities. School officials, families, and
</p>
<p>software developers have to be mindful of how data privacy, confidentiality, and
</p>
<p>security practices affect students. Schools and districts have an obligation to tell
</p>
<p>students and families what kind of student data the school or third parties (e.g.,
</p>
<p>online educational service providers) are collecting and how the data can be used.
</p>
<p>Privacy is a particularly hot-button issue in technology, considering the perva-
</p>
<p>sive nature of the Internet in people&rsquo;s daily lives. Many Web sites collect user data,
</p>
<p>from usernames and passwords to personal information such as addresses and
</p>
<p>phone numbers, without the explicit permission of users. Selling this information is
</p>
<p>widely considered unethical, but is often in a legal gray area because the user
</p>
<p>provides the data in the first place.

<p>Example 1: So You Think You Can Secure Your Mobile Phone with a
</p>
<p>Fingerprint?
</p>
<p>No two people are believed to have identical fingerprints, but researchers at
</p>
<p>the New York University Tandon School of Engineering and Michigan State
</p>
<p>University College of Engineering have found that partial similarities
</p>
<p>between prints are common enough that the fingerprint-based security sys-
</p>
<p>tems used in mobile phones and other electronic devices can be more vul-
</p>
<p>nerable than previously thought.
</p>

</p>
<p>13.3.2 Quality Control, Accreditation and Sustainability
Issues
</p>
<p>Example 2: Does Apple Have an Obligation to Make the iPhone Safer
</p>
<p>for Kids?
</p>
<p>The average teen spends at least six hours a day looking at a screen, with
</p>
<p>most of it from using a smart phone. Many parents, naturally, have wondered
</p>
<p>if so much time spent in front of a screen is safe.
</p>
<p>Research suggests that digital media stimulates the same brain chemicals
</p>
<p>and regions as other addictive products. Indeed, there is an increasing con-
</p>
<p>sensus that the technology companies who have led us into the digital age
</p>
<p>have a responsibility to build some safeguards.
</p>
<p>(See https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-apple-have-an-oblig
</p>
<p>ation-to-make-the-iphone-safer-for-kids/)
</p>
<p>Accreditation and Quality Assurance has established itself as the leading infor-
</p>
<p>mation and discussion forum for all aspects relevant to quality, transparency, and
</p>
<p>reliability of measurement. Since the 1990s, with the rapid development and
</p>
<p>popularization of the Internet, a wide range of resources cooperation and sharing
</p>
<p>has become the general trend, and the technical standards of learning resources in
</p>
<p>this process have played a crucial role.
</p>
<p>These issues involve resources sharing and relevant standards making in dif-
</p>
<p>ferent countries which will affect the diffusion of technology. For example,
</p>
<p>SCORM (see https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/), which defines communications
</p>
<p>between client-side content and a host system are closely related to sustainability.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Example 3: Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)
</p>
<p>SDOs are standards development organizations which work to formulate
</p>
<p>health and safety standards. The term &ldquo;standard&rsquo; includes a wide variety of
</p>
<p>technical works that prescribe rules, guidelines, best practices, specifications,
</p>
<p>test methods, design or installation procedures and the like. The size, scope,
</p>
<p>and subject matter of standards vary widely, ranging from lengthy model
</p>
<p>building or electrical codes to narrowly scoped test methods or product
</p>
<p>specifications.
</p>
<p>(See https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/standards-development-pr
</p>
<p>ocess/the-value-of-standards-development-organizations)
</p>
<p>For sustainability, once the resources cooperation and sharing process have been
</p>
<p>fully implemented, efforts must turn to greater efficiency in programme delivery and
</p>
<p>to maintaining stakeholder engagement, and also political support for widescale
</p>
<p>realignment of budgets and resources. Even initially effective, resources coopera-
</p>
<p>tion, and sharing interventions may change in their effects over time. Therefore,
</p>
<p>interventions must adapt to changing circumstances and contexts over time to
</p>
<p>continue to be effective and relevant to stakeholders and intended target groups.
</p>
<p>13.3.3 Culture and Regional Issues
</p>
<p>The utilization of technology has a close relationship to specific regions and cul-
</p>
<p>tures. Culture and region may affect the transfer of technology. New groups of
</p>
<p>students from different backgrounds should be considered. Some are digital natives
</p>
<p>(persons who understand the value of digital technology and seek out every
</p>
<p>opportunity to use it), whereas some may be digital immigrants (late, recent, and
</p>
<p>perhaps even reluctant adopters of the new technology; Prensky, 2001). The dif-
</p>
<p>ferent generations with different cultural and regional backgrounds may have a
</p>
<p>different understanding of technology and its use in a lesson.
</p>
<p>Culture and regional differences affect human behavior patterns (O&rsquo;Neil, 2006),
</p>
<p>and these differences are always reflected in the way people study, share knowledge
</p>
<p>and skills with others, and so on. Some researchers hold the view that cultural
</p>
<p>differences can have a negative effect on students&rsquo; participation in online courses
</p>
<p>(Shattuck, 2005).
</p>
<p>Example 4: What Effect Does Culture Have on Learning? BBC News
</p>
<p>How important are schools? That is the question posed by John Jerrim, a
</p>
<p>researcher at the Institute of Education. To answer it, he looks at Australian
</p>
<p>families of Chinese heritage. They go to Australian schools, and yet they do
</p>
<p>not seem to absorb teaching like other Australians.

<p>Example 5: Beyond the Classroom: The Impact of Culture on the
</p>
<p>Classroom
</p>
<p>When humans grow up without culture, do they ultimately invent it? What
</p>
<p>role does culture play in defining the individual? How does culture impact
</p>
<p>learning?
</p>
<p>Culture includes what people actually do and what they believe. Culture
</p>
<p>influences greatly how we see the world, how we try to understand it, and
</p>
<p>how we communicate with each other. Culture determines, to a great extent,
</p>
<p>learning and teaching styles with the help of technology.

<p>13.4 Challenges for Educational Technology
</p>
<p>In addition to the issues previously discussed, there are a number of recurring
</p>
<p>problem areas that have been called challenges in Woolf&rsquo;s (2010) Roadmap for
</p>
<p>Education Technology (see https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/
</p>
<p>GROE-Roadmap-for-Education-Technology-Final-Report.pdf). That report focused
</p>
<p>on the role and impact of computing and technology in education, including rec-
</p>
<p>ommendations for the future. Seven grand challenges were identified followed by
</p>
<p>seven technology recommendations, which will be discussed in the following texts.
</p>
<p>In addition, the New Media Consortium&rsquo;s Horizon Reports emphasize similar
</p>
<p>challenges and considerations.
</p>
<p>13.4.1 Personalizing Education
</p>
<p>The one-method-fits-all approach does not match up with a diverse population and
</p>
<p>the potential of new technologies; moreover, finding in cognitive psychology and
</p>
<p>new technologies makes it possible to create effective learning activities to meet
</p>
<p>individual student needs and interests.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.4.2 Assessing Student Learning
</p>
<p>There is a need for effective assessments of students and teachers, not only for
</p>
<p>accountability and promotion (summative) but also to improve learning and
</p>
<p>instruction (formative). The focus of assessment should be on improving learning,
</p>
<p>and assessments should be seamless and ubiquitous (woven into learning activities
</p>
<p>unobtrusively), especially from the perspective of life-long learning.
</p>
<p>13.4.3 Supporting Social Learning
</p>
<p>Supporting meaningful and collaborative learning activities is more important than
</p>
<p>ever before, partly due to requirements in the workplace to work collaboratively and
</p>
<p>partly due to the affordances of new Web 2.0 technologies.
</p>
<p>13.4.4 Diminishing Boundaries
</p>
<p>Traditional boundaries between students and teachers, between and among personal
</p>
<p>abilities and types of learning, between formal and informal learning, and between
</p>
<p>learning and working are changing and becoming blurred in the twenty-first cen-
</p>
<p>tury; this creates a need to recognize the significance of informal learning and
</p>
<p>different learner abilities and interests.
</p>
<p>13.4.5 Developing Alternative Teaching Strategies
</p>
<p>The teacher is no longer the sole source of expertise in classroom settings due to the
</p>
<p>widespread availability of networked resources; this creates a need to change
</p>
<p>instructional approaches and train teachers accordingly.
</p>
<p>13.4.6 Enhancing the Role of Stakeholders
</p>
<p>Stakeholders in educational systems need to develop trust that those systems are
</p>
<p>adequately preparing students for productive lives in twenty-first-century society; as
</p>
<p>a consequence, there is a need to regularly consult with employers, parents,
</p>
<p>administrators, teachers, and students to ensure that all stakeholders have confi-
</p>
<p>dence that the educational system is working well.
</p>
<p>13.4 Challenges for Educational Technology 239</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.4.7 Addressing Policy Changes
</p>
<p>The knowledge society requires flexibility on the part of an informed population;
</p>
<p>educational inequities and the digital divide can challenge the stability of a society
</p>
<p>and need to be addressed, as with the other challenges.
</p>
<p>13.4.8 Challenges in Horizon Reports
</p>
<p>The Horizon Project defines solvable challenges, difficult challenges, and wicked
</p>
<p>challenges. Solvable challenges that we understand and know how to solve
</p>
<p>including improving digital literacy and integrating formal and informal learning.
</p>
<p>Difficult challenges are ones that we understand but for which solutions are elusive,
</p>
<p>such as achievement gap and advancing digital equity. Wicked challenges are
</p>
<p>categorized as complex to even define, much less address, such as managing
</p>
<p>knowledge obsolescence and rethinking the roles of educators.
</p>
<p>Key Points in This Chapter
</p>
<p>(1) Four kinds of emerging technologies will have potentials to improve learning
</p>
<p>and instruction: learning analytics, artificial intelligence, wearable devices, and
</p>
<p>adaptive learning.
</p>
<p>(2) Issues involving in emerging technologies: ethical, security and privacy issues,
</p>
<p>quality control, accreditation and sustainability issues, culture and regional
</p>
<p>issues.
</p>
<p>(3) Challenges for educational technology: personalizing education, assessing
</p>
<p>student learning, supporting social learning, diminishing boundaries, devel-
</p>
<p>oping alternative teaching strategies, enhancing the role of stakeholders,
</p>
<p>addressing policy changes, challenges in Horizon Reports.

</p>
<p>Key Terms in the Book
</p>
<p>1. A system is a combination of more than two interacting and interconnected
</p>
<p>elements which function as an organic or integrated or coordinated whole.
</p>
<p>2. A learning management system (LMS) is a Web-based collection of software
</p>
<p>programs designed to support the management and delivery of learning
</p>
<p>resources and courses to students. An LMS has tools for registering students,
</p>
<p>delivering resources (text, audio, and video), tracking user logins, supporting
</p>
<p>online chatting, calculating grades, administering assessments, and uploading
</p>
<p>and storing user submissions.
</p>
<p>3. A serious game or applied game is a game designed for a primary purpose
</p>
<p>other than pure entertainment. The &ldquo;serious&rdquo; adjective is generally prepended to
</p>
<p>refer to video games used by industries such as defense, education, scientific
</p>
<p>exploration, health care, emergency management, city planning, engineering,
</p>
<p>and politics.
</p>
<p>4. According to cognitivism, learning is not a stimulus-response sequence, but the
</p>
<p>formation of cognitive structures. The learners do not simply receive stimuli
</p>
<p>mechanically and react passively, but, rather, learners process stimuli and
</p>
<p>determine appropriate responses.
</p>
<p>5. Adaptability for educational technology mainly deals with the diversity of
</p>
<p>students and their learning preferences.
</p>
<p>6. Adaptive learning is a computer-based and/or online educational system that
</p>
<p>modifies the presentation of material in response to student performance.
</p>
<p>Best-of-breed systems capture fine-grained data and use learning analytics to
</p>
<p>enable human tailoring of responses. The associated learning management
</p>
<p>systems (LMS) provide comprehensive administration, documentation, track-
</p>
<p>ing and reporting progress, and user management.
</p>
<p>7. ADDIE: The ADDIE model is a framework that lists generic processes that
</p>
<p>instructional designers and training developers use. It represents a descriptive
</p>
<p>guideline for building effective training and performance support tools in five
</p>
<p>phases: analysis, design, develop, implement, and evaluate.

<p>8. An education system is a man-made system and can be considered as a sub-
</p>
<p>system of the society in which it exists. One might think of an education system
</p>
<p>as taking inputs from the society (e.g., students) and providing outputs to
</p>
<p>society (e.g., graduates). Moreover, an education system could be conceptu-
</p>
<p>alized as a collection of subsystems, such as a school system, a curricular
</p>
<p>system, a grading system, and so on.
</p>
<p>9. An ICAI system is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence tech-
</p>
<p>niques for representing knowledge and performing an interaction with a student
</p>
<p>to stimulate and control his learning in a given field. In an intelligent instruc-
</p>
<p>tional system, the student is actively engaged with the educational environment,
</p>
<p>and his interests and misunderstandings drive the tutorial dialogue.
</p>
<p>10. An instructional system is a subsystem within an education system, although
</p>
<p>one can describe elements and interactions relevant to an instructional system
</p>
<p>(e.g., resources, assessments, instructors, students, scaffolding, etc.). One can
</p>
<p>also consider a curriculum as a system within the larger instructional system.
</p>
<p>In short, one can elaborate on an education system in terms of subsystems.
</p>
<p>11. An intelligent tutoring system is computer software designed to simulate a
</p>
<p>human tutor&rsquo;s behavior and guidance. It can assist students in studying a variety
</p>
<p>of subjects by posing questions, parsing responses, and offering customized
</p>
<p>instruction and feedback.
</p>
<p>12. ARCS model is a problem-solving approach to designing the motivational
</p>
<p>aspects of learning environments to stimulate and sustain students' motivation
</p>
<p>to learn.
</p>
<p>13. Augmented reality (AR) involves the addition of a computer-assisted
</p>
<p>contextual layer of information overlaid on a real-world context or situation,
</p>
<p>creating an enhanced or augmented reality.
</p>
<p>14. Behaviorism is a perspective that focuses almost exclusively on directly
</p>
<p>observable things to explain learning. The major idea of behaviorism is that
</p>
<p>learning is the stimulus-response sequence.
</p>
<p>15. Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy refers to six levels, sub-domains within the cognitive
</p>
<p>domain, which are knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis,
</p>
<p>and evaluation. The six levels are classified hierarchically from the simplest
</p>
<p>action to the high-order thinking actions.
</p>
<p>16. CAI is the method of instruction in which there is a purposeful interaction
</p>
<p>between a learner and the computer device (having useful instructional material
</p>
<p>as software) for helping the individual learner achieve the desired instructional
</p>
<p>objectives with his own pace and abilities at his command.
</p>
<p>17. Centrality describes the numbers of ties an actor has. The more ties an actor
</p>
<p>has, the higher centrality the actor is. When the network has direction, there are
</p>
<p>two indicators to explain centrality: in-degree and out-degree.
</p>
<p>18. CIPP evaluation model: evaluation can be adapted in four aspects: context
</p>
<p>evaluation, input evaluation, process evaluation, and product evaluation.
</p>
<p>19. Cloud computing refers to expandable, on-demand services, and tools that
</p>
<p>serve users via the Internet from a specialized data center and that are not
</p>
<p>installed on users&rsquo; devices.
</p>
<p>244 Appendix: Key Terms in the Book</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20. Cognitive load theory: the theory that short-term memory limitations are a
</p>
<p>primary consideration in designing effective instruction, while intrinsic cog-
</p>
<p>nitive load is inherent in a learning task and cannot be manipulated, extrinsic
</p>
<p>cognitive load due to unnecessary distracters ought to be minimized.
</p>
<p>21. Collaborative learning is a situation in which two or more people learn or
</p>
<p>attempt to learn something together. Unlike individual learning, people engaged
</p>
<p>in collaborative learning capitalize on one another's resources and skills (asking
</p>
<p>one another for information, evaluating one another's ideas, monitoring one
</p>
<p>another's work, etc.).
</p>
<p>22. Comfortability with educational technology relates to providing or experi-
</p>
<p>encing educational technology&rsquo;s physical well-being.
</p>
<p>23. Competitor analysis: Its main purpose is to provide references on function-
</p>
<p>ality, usability, key technologies for product design, to help designers to
</p>
<p>explore the core demands of the target users, and learn how the competitive
</p>
<p>products meet the requirements of the target users.
</p>
<p>24. Connectivism is a hypothesis of learning which emphasizes the role of social
</p>
<p>and cultural contexts. It is the integration of principles explored by chaos,
</p>
<p>network, and complexity and self-organization theories. The central aspect of
</p>
<p>connectivism is the metaphor of a network with nodes and connections.
</p>
<p>25. Constructivism holds that learning is the process of constructing internal
</p>
<p>psychological representation in the process of interaction with the environment.
</p>
<p>Helping learners involves helping them to understand nature, regularity, and the
</p>
<p>inner connections among things.
</p>
<p>26. Content analysis is the method to analyze the procedures with text. The text
</p>
<p>usually includes chats, discussion boards, and log file data. The content analysis
</p>
<p>method includes three steps: (1) adopting a coding scheme, (2) coding the text,
</p>
<p>(3) analyzing the results.
</p>
<p>27. Cooperative learning, sometimes called small-group learning, is an instruc-
</p>
<p>tional strategy in which small groups of students work together on a common
</p>
<p>task. The task can be as simple as solving a multi-step math problem together,
</p>
<p>or as complex as developing a design for a new kind of school. In some cases,
</p>
<p>each group member is individually accountable for part of the task; in other
</p>
<p>cases, group members work together without formal role assignments.
</p>
<p>28. Density describes the connection degree of a network. It refers to the number of
</p>
<p>ties an actor has, divided by the total possible ties an actor could have.
</p>
<p>29. Design methodology is a robust methodology for innovation that has emerged,
</p>
<p>which integrates human, business, and technological factors in problem-
</p>
<p>forming, solving, and design.
</p>
<p>30. Design-based research is a systemic approach to the planning and imple-
</p>
<p>menting of innovations that emphasizes an iterative approach to design with
</p>
<p>ongoing involvement of and collaboration with practitioners.
</p>
<p>31. Desirability in an educational technology refers to the attractiveness and
</p>
<p>engagement of the activities in educational technology or the pleasing per-
</p>
<p>ception from teachers and students.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>32. Educational project is a planned effort to bring about desired educational
</p>
<p>outcomes, which has a budget, resources, a definite beginning, a duration, and
</p>
<p>reasonably well-defined goals and objectives.
</p>
<p>33. Educational technology is the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning
</p>
<p>and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate
</p>
<p>technological processes and resources.
</p>
<p>34. Function list is the integration of functions that is designed to satisfy certain
</p>
<p>demands, which also includes the correlation, level of importance, and remarks
</p>
<p>of the functions.
</p>
<p>35. Gagn&eacute;&rsquo;s types of learning: (a) verbal information (e.g., facts), (b) intellectual
</p>
<p>skills (e.g., using rules to solve a problem), (c) cognitive strategies (e.g.,
</p>
<p>selecting a process to address a problem situation), (d) motor skills (e.g., riding
</p>
<p>a bicycle), and (e) attitudes (e.g., dislike of mathematics).
</p>
<p>36. Humanism focuses on human's overall development, emphasizes human dig-
</p>
<p>nity and value, and pays attention to the health and integrity of people.
</p>
<p>37. Inquiry-based learning approach is a method with which students learn
</p>
<p>knowledge driven by specific questions or a complex problem. The teacher

</p>
<p>this process.
</p>
<p>38. Interactive whiteboard (IWB) is a large interactive display in the form factor
</p>
<p>of a whiteboard. It can either be a standalone touchscreen computer used
</p>
<p>independently to perform tasks and operations or a connectable apparatus used
</p>
<p>as a touchpad to control computers from a projector. They are used in a variety
</p>
<p>of settings, including classrooms at all levels of education, in corporate
</p>
<p>boardrooms and work groups, in training rooms for professional sports
</p>
<p>coaching, in broadcasting studios, and others.

</p>
<p>perspective in the interaction with an educational product or learning
</p>
<p>environment
</p>

<p>44. Learning objectivesare sets of knowledge, skill, or behavior that learners are
</p>
<p>expected to know, understand, and/or perform as a result of learning. Learning
</p>
<p>objectives can be measured to determine the knowledge (cognitive) or skills
</p>
<p>and behaviors (affective) that learners have gained over time.
</p>
<p>45. Learning spaces are designed to support, facilitate, stimulate, or enhance
</p>
<p>learning and teaching. Learning spaces encompass formal, informal, and virtual
</p>
<p>environments.

</p>
<p>acquire.
</p>
<p>47. Logic model: This is a visual representation of the theory of change for a
</p>
<p>particular effort that depicts (a) key aspects of the current situation, (b) activities
</p>
<p>associated with the effort (inputs), (c) the anticipated results of those activities
</p>
<p>(outputs), and (d) short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes of the effort.
</p>
<p>48. Makerspaces are open community laboratories where people of similar
</p>
<p>interests come together to make all kinds of objects or things. Makerspaces
</p>
<p>typically have various kinds of fabrication technologies along with 3D printers.
</p>
<p>Students of all ages have made and shared various kinds of designs.
</p>
<p>49. Mayer&rsquo;s principles of multimedia learning: The cognitive theory of multi-
</p>
<p>media learning centers on the idea that learners attempt to build meaningful
</p>
<p>connections between words and pictures, which they learn more deeply than
</p>
<p>they could have with words or pictures alone. It contains twelve multimedia
</p>
<p>learning or instructional principles which were developed from nearly 100
</p>
<p>studies over the past two decades.
</p>
<p>50. Original requirements analysis refers to the unprocessed requirements or
</p>
<p>demands proposed by the originator at the launching stage of the project.
</p>
<p>51. Primary users are those persons who actually use the artifact.
</p>
<p>52. Problem analysis: a structured investigation of the negative aspects of a sit-
</p>
<p>uation in order to establish the causes and their effects.
</p>
<p>53. Project is a series of activities or a structure aimed at bringing about clearly
</p>
<p>specified objectives within a set time and a given budget.
</p>
<p>54. Scenario analysis is a process of analyzing possible future events by consid-
</p>
<p>ering alternative possible outcomes (sometimes called &ldquo;alternative worlds&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>55. Secondary users are those who will occasionally use the artifact or those who
</p>
<p>use it through an intermediary.
</p>
<p>56. Social learning: a change in understanding that goes beyond the individual to
</p>
<p>become situated within wider social units or communities of practice through
</p>
<p>social interactions between actors within social networks.
</p>
<p>57. Social network: a social structure made of individuals (or organizations) called
</p>
<p>&ldquo;nodes,&rdquo; which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of
</p>
<p>interdependency.
</p>
<p>58. Sociogram is the visualization to show the situation of the whole or the part of
</p>
<p>the social network. In the sociogram, the node represents the actor, the line
</p>
<p>represents the relationship between actors, and the arrow direction represents
</p>
<p>the information flow.

</p>
<p>ment, or other messages.
</p>
<p>61. Technology: According to Rogers, E.M. (1995), technology is &ldquo; a design for
</p>
<p>instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty in the cause effect relationships
</p>
<p>involved in achieving a desired outcome.&rdquo; A technology usually has two
</p>
<p>components: (1) a hardware aspect, consisting the tool that embodies the
</p>
<p>technology as a material or physical object, and (2) a software aspect, con-
</p>
<p>sisting the information base for the tool.
</p>
<p>62. Technology-enhanced inquiry learning refers to the use of educational tech-
</p>
<p>nologies to support student learning in inquiry settings. This entry provides (a) a
</p>
<p>definition of inquiry learning, (b) a discussion of educational technologies that
</p>
<p>can support information access and cognition in inquiry learning, and (c) a dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of implications of technology-enhanced inquiry learning for education.
</p>
<p>63. Tertiary users are persons who will be affected by the use of the artifact or
</p>
<p>make decisions about its purchase.
</p>
<p>64. The value of learner experience refers to the positive or negative quality that
</p>
<p>renders the changes of the classroom, such as classroom furnishings and layout
</p>
<p>changes, the use of equipment, desirable or valuable for the learners.
</p>
<p>65. Usability refers to the ease of use and learnability of educational technology,
</p>
<p>which is composed of learnability, efficiency, memorability, satisfaction.
</p>
<p>66. User experience (UX) refers to a person's perceptions and responses that result
</p>
<p>from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service.
</p>
