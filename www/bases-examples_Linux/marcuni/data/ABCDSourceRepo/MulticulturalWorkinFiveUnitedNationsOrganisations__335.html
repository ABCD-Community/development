<p>This book aims at developing an understanding of multicultural work in five 
Organisations of the United Nations. The context of international organisations 
differs from international companies, amongst others, with regards to the legal 
base, the financial and operational agenda, and human resource practices.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to explore which factors are a trigger, a barrier, and/
or an influence on team and group work in this specific context. Based on 50 
semi-structured, personal interviews which were analysed within the framework 
of constant comparison method, a typology of multicultural work is provided. 
Moreover, this study offers an integrative view of the reciprocal relationships 
between organisation, management, group and individual.

<p>Dagmar Kiefer received her doctorate in International Management from the 
Vienna University of Economics and Business in 2008. During her doctoral studies 
she mostly worked full time for an international company and spent numerous 
months abroad to work and to research.

<p>Abstract 
</p>
<p>This book aims at developing an understanding of multicultural work in five Or-
ganisations of the United Nations. The context of international organisations dif-
fers from international companies, amongst others, with regards to the legal 
base, the financial and operational agenda, and human resource practices. 
The purpose of this study is to explore which factors are a trigger, a barrier, 
and/or an influence on team and group work in this specific context. Based on 
50 semi-structured, personal interviews a typology of multicultural work is pro-
vided. Moreover, this study offers an integrative view of the reciprocal relation-
ships between organisation, management, group and individual.

<p>I. Introduction 
</p>
<p>1.1. Background to the research 
</p>
<p>The United Nations Organisation at the beginning of the 2 I st century is different 
from the Organisation which emerged more than 60 years ago. The number of 
member states has increased from 51 founding members in 1945 to 191 up to 
day. The United Nations Organisation has grown from a group of countries 
which have committed themselves voluntarily to safeguard peace, to an interna-
tional organisation with several headquarters and a wide range of missions 
around the globe. This world organisation works with all different kinds of part-
ners (governments, other international organisations, civil society groups, pri-
vate sector companies etc.) on equally different activities. Consequently, the 
United Nations Organisation is a work place for a constantly growing number of 
people who come from different parts of the world, belonging to different cul-
tures and religions. 
Simultaneously the criticism of this world organisation has increased. Today's 
United Nations Organisation is considered being lame, inefficient, and costly. A 
legitimate question therefore is whether or not the structure of this organisation 
and its staff can keep up with the new needs and requirements induced by a 
changing environment? 
Numerous attempts have been made to reform the United Nations Organisations. 
The latest reform proposal was initiated by the former Secretary-General, Kofi 
Annan (2006), who suggested reforms in six areas: people, leadership, informa-
tion and communications technology, delivering services, budget and finance, 
and governance. The detailed measures formulated in the proposal aimed to en-
able the organisation to make better use of its managerial and human resources. 
Interestingly, Mr. Annan mentioned a reform of the personnel system on the first 
place suggesting reforms in recruitment and career development. These sugges-
tions also alluded to a reform at the management level and of the leadership 
situation. 
Unfortunately this reform package was not passed because the majority of the 
member states voted against it. This vote shows the fragile side of this huge in-
tergovernmental organisation which is financed by states and therefore the very 
same states have the power to induce change, or block it. As formulated by one 
interviewee: ,,The UN is very weak, it is a receiver of political and economical 
realities." 
However, this does not mean that there is no remedy whatsoever. 
In management literature, the importance of teams and groups is accentuated as 
a factor increasing the performance of organisations as well as the performance

</p>
<p>of individuals. Numerous studies have shown that teams and groups decisively 
contribute to innovation, quality of service, cost reduction and increased produc-
tivity. Whilst a Jot of research into teams and groups in internationally operating 
companies has been conducted, only rudimentary empirical research into the 
functioning of teams and groups in international organisations has been under-
taken so far. Consequently, the contribution of this research is to assess the state 
of the art of team and group work in management literature and at the same time 
to investigate what kind of group and/or team work is practised in five Organisa-
tions of the United Nations. This study then attempts to highlight triggers and 
barriers for team and group work in five Organisations of the United Nations 
and aims at developing propositions and a model of analysis specifically ad-
dressing these triggers and barriers. 
Summarising, the two central research questions are: 
</p>
<p>&bull; What kind of team and group work exists in five United Nations Organi-
sations? 
</p>
<p>&bull; Which factors are a trigger, a barrier, and/or influence team and group 
work in this context? 
</p>
<p>Answering these two questions leads to develop: 
</p>
<p>&bull; Propositions comprising the organisational, group and individual context 
&bull; A model of analysis 
&bull; Managerial implications 
</p>
<p>The type of question (how and why team and group work is/is not practised in 
five United Nations Organisations), the explanatory purpose of this study (e.g. 
the identification of triggers and barriers for team and group work) and the focus 
on contemporary events led me to apply a qualitative research design. 50 semi 
structured interviews with predominately Austrian staff in five Organisations of 
the United Nations based in three locations were conducted for this case study. 
The interview data was analysed using the constant comparison method devel-
oped by Glaser &amp; Strauss ( 1967) and as explicated by Boeije (2002). 
</p>
<p>1.2. Structure of this study 
This study is structured along the following chapters: 
Chapter II provides an overview of management literature referring to team and 
group work and discusses in a critical review the controversial findings. The sa-
lience of missing definitions in literature is the main point of criticism. Chapter 
III covers the research methodology, method and explains the research design.

<p>17 
</p>
<p>This chapter also discusses the sample and the context of research describing the 
five Organisations under investigation. Chapter IV presents empirical findings 
based on the analysis of 50 semi-structured interviews in five Organisations of 
the United Nations. Based on the empirical findings a theoretical model of trig-
gers and barriers for team work is presented in chapter V. This study concludes 
with chapter VI which raises a discussion of research findings, managerial im-
plications and limitations of this study.

<p>II. Literature Review on current Studies into Teams and Groups 
in Organisations 
</p>
<p>2.1. Introduction 
Teams and groups in companies have been intensively studied over the past two 
decades. Different disciplines looked at various aspects of teams and groups in 
the private sector. To list a few, research has investigated group composition, 
task design, organisational context, environmental factors, internal processes, 
personality traits, diversity and effectiveness. Furthermore, the definitions of 
teams and groups used in the different studies vary. Existing literature has inves-
tigated work teams, work groups, self managed teams, management teams, and 
most recently virtual teams. In other words: the body of literature is vast. 
The following literature review systematically structures existing team and 
group literature relevant to the conceptual framework of this thesis. 
The aim of this review is 
</p>
<p>&bull; to give an overview of the definitions of the terms team and group 
&bull; to give an overview of studies of teams and groups in real organisational 
</p>
<p>settings and 
&bull; to identify which factors enhance and influence teamwork 
</p>
<p>2.2. Definition of the terms team and group 
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a variety of definitions for the terms team and group exist 
and often the terms are used interchangeably. The mere existence of two terms 
suggests that there must be a difference. The Oxford English Dictionary (1989) 
records the following uses of the terms: 
Group (in general): A number of persons or things regarded as forming a unit 
on account of any kind of mutual or common relation, or classified together on 
account of a common degree of similarity (Vol. VI, p 887) 
Team: A number of persons associated with some joint action; now esp. a defi-
nite number of persons forming a side in a match, in any team sport, hence a 
group collaborating in their professional work or in some enterprise or assign-
ment (Vol. XVII, p 692) 
According to the dictionary the term group is the more general one whereas the 
term team is more special as joint action is implied. Hare ( 1992) argues that the 
term team is reserved for work groups that are highly visible and require more 
differentiated roles and more integration of members' activity. He further argues 
that no clear distinction between the terms is evident in the social-psychological 
literature. The current literature review also shows that researchers often use the 
terms interchangeably: for example Bettenhausen (1991) intensively reviewed 
group research and only refers to teams in the context of team building activi-

<p>ties, whereas Cohen and Bailey (1997) refer to Bettenhausen's work as a review 
of teams. Over the years, the term team has largely replaced the term group. Es-
pecially in management literature the term team is used more often ( e.g. em-
powered teams, self managed teams, team effectiveness) whereas the academic 
literature used the word group more frequently (group dynamics, group cohe-
sion, group effectiveness). Still there is no universally accepted definition of the 
terms in management literature (Guzzo &amp; Dickson, 1996). However, some re-
searchers agreed on one widely established definition of team being "a collec-
tion of individuals who are interdependent in their task and who share responsi-
bility for outcomes" (Guzzo &amp; Shea, 1992; Hackman, 1987; Sundstrom, De-
Meuse, &amp; Futrell, 1990). 
Table 1 below gives an overview of the definitions of the terms team and group 
found in the articles analysed.

Francis &amp; Occasionally we meet an exceptional group that combines high 
Young morale, effective task performance, and clear relevance to the

Hackmann Work groups are intact, bounded social systems, with interde-
(1983) pendent members and differentiated member roles that pursue

report to the same supervisor and who are engaged in tasks re-
Quiring some degree of coordination.

Jackson, &amp; which (a) employees share functionally interrelated tasks and 
Clegg (1986) are collectively responsible for end products, (b) individual 
</p>
<p>team members have the variety of skills necessary to perform 
tasks that are the collective responsibility of the team, and ( c) 
employees receive feedback and evaluations that are given in 
terms of team performance. Self-directed work teams have a 
high degree of self-determination that includes control over the 
pace of work, distribution of tasks, work breaks, and participa-
tion in recruiting and training new members.

<p>Alderfer A team is a collection of individuals who are interdependent in 
(1977), their task, who share responsibility for outcomes, who see 
Hackman themselves and who are seen by others as an intact social entity 
(1987), embedded in one or more lager social systems (for example 
Sundstrom, business unit or the corporation), and who manage their rela-

</p>
<p>The definitions above bear several messages: 
</p>
<p>At a general level, most definitions include (1) who is on the team/group, (2) 
why those individuals are on the team/group and (3) what their task and/or goal 
is. At a more narrow level some definitions describe specific types of 
teams/groups only, whereas others are less detailed and structured. Nonetheless, 
the general idea of a team or a group is basically the same which may be one 
reason for the interchangeable use of the two terms. Contrary, Gibson &amp; Zell-
mer-Bruhn (2001) argue that in a multinational context the differences in the 
definition of teams account for different outcomes of similar studies. 
Summing up, there is no clear definition of and no clear line between the terms 
group and team. As a result, researchers use the terms interchangeably and 
therefore both terms were included in the keyword search for this literature re-
view. 
</p>
<p>2.3. Journal review: Studies of teams and groups in real organisational set-
tings 
The broad field of team/group work and its outcomes has been widely discussed 
in academia in the past decades. Consequently, there is such a huge body of lit-
erature across various disciplines that in fact it has become rather difficult to get 
an overview of existing research. To give a structure to the findings of research 
into team and group work, the following steps have been taken: 
A journal review of team and group literature in 25 academic journals and man-
agement journals between 1998 and March 2007 was conducted. The journals 
were chosen based on their rating ( common consideration as top and leading 
academic journals) and because of their relevance in the field of group research 
and public administration. 
Prior to the physical journal review a number of criteria for inclusion and exclu-
sion of articles were developed. Only studies published in the journals listed (ta-
ble 2) were included, only studies conducted in real work environments have 
been chosen as these findings can more readily be generalised to the world of 
work, and only studies of teams and/or groups of employees were included. 
Consequently, the following exclusion criteria were developed: studies with stu-
dents or experimental studies were not included because of the practical focus of 
the topic of this dissertation. Furthermore, management teams were excluded as 
this thesis focuses on employees. Lastly, action teams (e.g. sport teams), per-
forming teams (e.g. musical groups), teams in hospitals (e.g. health care teams), 
and virtual teams were excluded. However, conceptual and theoretical articles as 
well as meta analyses have been looked at and will be presented in the review. 
The literature review is partly based on three seminal reviews of team literature 
which have been conducted recently. Van Knippenberg &amp; Schippers (2007) re-
viewed literature on work group diversity from 1997-2005, Rasmussen &amp; Jeppe-

<p>sen (2006) assessed current knowledge of teams and associated psychological 
factors from 2000 to 2005, and Stock (2004) investigated drivers of team per-
formance in articles published between 1990 and 2003. The current review in-
cludes all factors in one paper and covers the period between 1998 and March 
2007. However, slightly different journals have been looked at and therefore not 
all articles listed in the reviews mentioned will be covered in this review. 
A keyword search using the terms "team", "group", "work team", and "work-
group" within the journals listed was conducted. 96 out of approximately 12.000 
articles in the 25 journals screened were identified as being relevant. 
Table 2 gives an overview of the journals screened and the number of articles 
found relevant for the topic.

<p>Subsequently, the 96 included studies were analysed by the author. 
First, the articles were screened with regards to what kind of teams or groups 
were looked at to get an overview of the different terms used. Furthermore, the 
studies were grouped into quantitative and qualitative and I also distinguished 
between studies conducted in the private and the public sector. 
In the following, a few general comments on the findings of the article search 
will be made before the literature analysis will be discussed in more detail. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The majority of studies (73 studies out of 96) were conducted in the pri-
vate sector and followed a quantitative research approach (76 studies). 
This phenomenon highlights the importance of qualitative research in the 
public sector and as a consequence the relevance of this dissertation. 
Nonetheless, the findings of existing studies form a vital basis for this re-
search setting, as it is suggested that findings of team/group work in pri-
vate sector companies can at least partly also be found in team/group set-
tings in the public sector. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Because of the variety of definitions and the interchangeable use of the 
terms, the articles identified were also analysed according to the definition 
of team/group and the terminology used in the different studies. The ma-
jority of articles (78 out of 96) did not provide a clear definition of the 
unit of analysis at all. Some authors used the terms team and group inter-
changeably and only 18 studies actually provided a definition of the units 
of interest. 
</p>
<p>Appendix l gives an overview of all articles screened. The articles are sorted by 
author in alphabetical order and labelled into categories such as private/public 
sector, qualitative/quantitative studies and show definitions of the terms used.

<p>2.4. Aspects of team/group work in literature 
</p>
<p>In the following pages, the studies of teams and groups in organisational settings 
which have been found in the course of the journal and literature review will be 
presented in more detail. 
The articles are grouped around three main aspects of interest in research into 
teams and groups:

<p>1. Organisational aspects such as organisational context, structure and cul-
ture, 
</p>
<p>2. Managerial aspects such as leadership, relationships between management 
and individuals, and 
</p>
<p>3. Individual aspects such as diversity in its various forms and personality. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the articles will be summarised and presented. 
</p>
<p>2.4.1. Organisational aspects 
</p>
<p>Organisational aspects such as the context in which groups and teams are em-
bedded are depicted by the structure and culture of an organisation as well as 
society and politics. Context is inescapable because it is there whenever research 
is conducted. However, this does not mean that context is also considered in the 
setting and analysis of research. How much attention is paid to it lies solely in 
the hands of the researcher. Rousseau and Fried (2001, p.1) argue that the clue 
to more integrative studies is based in contextualisation which "entails linking 
observations to a set of relevant facts, events, or points of view that make possi-
ble research and theory that form part of a larger whole". In general, a rich de-
scription of the context of a research setting helps to explain the meaning, varia-
tion, and relationship among variables under study. 
The current review showed that organisational aspects only play a peripheral 
role in group and team literature. Most studies seem to have neglected the im-
portance of context and its effects on teams and groups. 
Those contextual influences which received the most attention in research into 
teams and groups in multinational companies are, according to Jackson et al. 
(2003): task characteristics (e.g. Gilson, Mathieu, Shalley, &amp; Ruddy, 2005; Gil-
son &amp; Shalley, 2004; Pelled, Eisenhardt, &amp; Xin, 1999), organisational culture 
(e.g. Ely &amp; Thomas, 2001; Polzer, Milton, &amp; Swann, 2002), and strategic con-
text (e.g. Jehn &amp; Bezrukova, 2004). 
Few studies noted the importance of boundary spanning activities as a key vari-
able that shapes group and team processes and outcomes. External activities or 
boundary spanning activities are directed toward the team's/ group's environ-
ment ( other units within the same organisation, other organisations, or the gen-
eral public). 
Choi (2002) revealed that traditional rules and organisational structures are in-
comparable with team and group settings. On the one hand, tasks are too inter-
dependent or too complex to be hierarchically managed. On the other hand, 
teams and groups need to communicate directly with other teams or units of the 
organisation or other organisations. For this reason, boundary activities on an 
organisational as well as on an individual level are being practised.

</p>
<p>Cross et. al (2000) demonstrated that adopting boundary-less organisational 
structures by implementing team and group structures lead to an increased need 
for boundary activities. In hierarchical structures boundary activities are exe-
cuted by functional heads while they shift to team and group members in less 
formalised structures. Keller (2001) associated boundary activities with team 
and group performance and maintained that external activities lead to a decrease 
in cohesiveness of a team/group. 
</p>
<p>As mentioned in 2.3. only a few studies ( 4 out of 96) were conducted in the 
context of public organisations. Despite the fact that the studies were undertaken 
in public sector organisations, the authors did not provide a description of the 
context nor did they refer to a possible contextual impact on the results. This 
lack of contextualisation may impede the reader's understanding and interpreta-
tion of results. 
In a longitudinal study Armstrong, Stassen, Wagar &amp; Cattaneo (2004) investi-
gated job satisfaction in association with downsizing in a public sector environ-
ment. Members of work groups that remained intact during and after the down-
sizing reacted with lower levels of job satisfaction, lower job involvement and 
lower perceived justice than those who underwent a change of team membership 
during the downsizing. To assess the impact of the structure and culture of the 
organisation studied would have been an interesting avenue for research. 
The same is true for the study conducted by Carless &amp; De Paola (2000) which 
focused on different forms of cohesion (task cohesion, social cohesion and indi-
vidual attraction to the group) in a team setting. 
Other studies conducted in the public sector investigated the role of perceived 
diversity in teams (Hohmann, Bordia, &amp; Gallois, 2003), and cognition and its 
indirect effects on team effectiveness (Rentsch &amp; Klimoski, 2001 ). 
</p>
<p>To summarise, a weakness of the studies analysed is that organisational aspects 
have often been ignored. If important contextual factors are ignored, results 
don't provide incremental knowledge. Yet, the understanding of the importance 
of contextual factors triggers one big problem: the number of potentially impor-
tant aspects of context may quickly become overwhelming (see also Jackson et. 
al, 2003). It is totally impossible to capture all contextual factors in one study. 
Moreover, quantitative studies might be limited by a higher complexity whereas 
qualitative studies offer more space for inclusion of a wider range of contextual 
factors and as a result more comprehensible and integrative explanations. 
</p>
<p>2.4.2. Managerial aspects 
</p>
<p>The move towards team based structures in organisations challenges managers 
to lead and motivate not only individuals but teams/groups as a whole. There-

</p>
<p>fore, the behaviour of managers/leaders as a main driver of team/group perform-
ance definitely needs to be considered in theoretical foundations and practical 
studies. However, the literature review revealed that studies on team perform-
ance in general have overemphasized a direct link between demographic or 
functional characteristics and outcomes without adequately describing interven-
ing psychological and social constructs. Literature focuses primarily on team 
processes but only rudimentary on the role of leadership styles and their impact 
on team performance (e.g. Zohar, 2002). As a result, the driving influence of 
managers on team processes and the role of leadership are still in an early stage 
of research. 
Joshi &amp; Lazarova (2005) researched extensively into competences which leaders 
of teams/groups should possess of in order to effectively lead such 
teams/groups. Chang &amp; Tharenou (2004) tried to asses a set of competences 
needed to manage a multicultural work team/group. In a qualitative study man-
agers as well as team/group members identified several competences which they 
considered as important: communication skills, the ability to continuously learn 
on the job and keep an interest in the work team/group, cultural empathy, hon-
esty, and stability. 
In a similar vein, Keller (2006) stressed in a longitudinal study that transforma-
tional leadership and initiating structure matter the most to R&amp;D team perform-
ance. A multilevel study of leadership, empowerment, and performance in teams 
was conducted by Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen &amp; Rosen (2007a). The study 
indicated that leaders need to use different approaches to motivate individual 
team members on the one hand and teams as a whole on the other hand. In the 
first case, a high level of mutual trust has to be built to empower individuals 
whereas in the latter case a delegation of autonomy and decision making is asso-
ciated with high empowerment and performance. The study by Chen, Lam &amp; 
Zhong (2007b) showed that managers can motivate employees to improve per-
formance by opening a clear and approachable channel through which they can 
seek positive and especially negative feedback. 
Also most recently, Ambrosini, Bowman &amp; Burton-Taylor (2007) have investi-
gated inter-team coordination activities as a driver of performance and a critical 
component of delivering customer satisfaction. Once again, the importance of 
encouraging communication in a team/group setting has been highlighted. Team 
empowerment as a trigger for higher performance and customer satisfaction was 
also reported by Kirkman &amp; Rosen ( 1999). 
In a cross-cultural study, Chevrier (2003) observed that when managers encoun-
ter cross-cultural differences, they often ignore them and rely on individual team 
members to surmount these differences. Moreover, in multinational teams, team 
members reported that they tended to forget the nationality of their colleague 
and to focus on technical issues. A study by Reagans, Zuckermann &amp; McEvily 
(2004) showed that the demographic composition of an organisation limits man-

</p>
<p>agers to shape the demographic composition of a team. They argue that as a re-
sult the manager's interventions are less likely to be successful. 
</p>
<p>The relevant literature has arrived at the conclusion that managing people very 
much depends on contextual aspects. However, the weakness of most studies is 
that these contextual aspects have - if at all - only rudimentary been considered 
and described. A greater attention to the link between leadership and organisa-
tional context would broaden our understanding of the effects of different man-
agement styles. 
Management practices and styles tend to be subject to trends and vary across 
cultures. Longitudinal studies would help to gain a deeper understanding of the 
complex interactions between individuals and to assess causality. 
One example for cross-cultural, longitudinal research is the Global Leadership 
and Organisational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) research programme. The 
programme's focus lies on culture and leadership in 61 nations. House et al. 
(2004) found that regardless of culture, there are some universal aspects of lead-
ership. 
Research lacks studies of management in international organisations. While 
challenges in the private sector may be found in some form in the public sector, 
it appears that the public sector faces more political influences and has to deal 
with more rules and regulations (Feldman, 2005). This gap in literature is an in-
teresting avenue for future research. 
</p>
<p>2.4.3. Individual aspects 
Teams and groups are a collection of individuals who may be different with re-
gards to a plethora of aspects such as nationality, gender, or personality. Hence, 
team and group literature is dominated by research into diversity in its various 
forms. 
Diversity research 
Typically diversity is conceptualised as a reference to the differences of personal 
attributes among interdependent members of a social unit (Jackson, 1992; Jack-
son et al., 2003; Triandis, Kurowski, &amp; Gelfand, 1994; Williams &amp; O'Reilly, 
1998). 
In practice diversity research focuses on differences 
</p>
<p>&bull; in demographic compositions like age, ethnicity, gender 
&bull; in job related issues such as education, function, task, and 
&bull; between individuals with regards to personality, attitudes, and values.

</p>
<p>Williams &amp; O'Reilly (1998) covered 40 years of diversity research in their 
seminal research into work group diversity. They identified two main strands in 
research into work group diversity and performance: 
</p>
<p>&bull; the social categorisation perspective and 
&bull; the information/decision-making perspective. 
</p>
<p>The social categorisation process is elicited by the assumption that demographic 
similarity/dissimilarity is the basis for categorising self and others into groups. 
As a result, people categorise demographically similar people as members of the 
in-group and dissimilar ones as members of the out-group (Brewer, 1979). Con-
sequently, people of the in-group are more similar to one self than members of 
the out-group. Furthermore, people tend to trust members of the in-group more 
than members of the out-group (Brewer, 1979; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986). Overall 
the self categorisation perspective arrives at the conclusion that the more ho-
mogenous the team/group the higher the commitment of the members and thus 
the higher the performance. 
The information/decision-making perspective holds the idea that heterogeneous 
teams/groups positively affect performance and creativity because of a broader 
range of perspectives, knowledge and abilities. This gives diverse teams/groups 
a larger pool of resources that may be especially helpful in dealing with non-
routine tasks and problems. In addition, diverse perspectives may lead to poten-
tially more innovative ideas and to solutions which would not have been reached 
in a homogenous team/group (De Dreu &amp; West, 2001). However, some studies 
found a higher rate of conflict in heterogeneous teams/groups and a greater need 
for reconciliation between the members of the team/group (Jehn, Northcraft, &amp; 
Neale, 1999; Lovelace, Shapiro, &amp; Weingart, 2001; Pelled et al., 1999). 
As a result of these two conflicting perspectives, a general disagreement exists 
on whether diversity in a team/group has overall positive or negative effects on 
performance. In his review, Bettenhausen (1991) even concluded in an overall 
negative effect of diversity on team performance. At the same time other re-
searchers highlight the positive effects of diversity in bringing the group a vari-
ety of values, perspectives and behaviours and therefore enhancing the overall 
creativity and performance. In support of this proposition, Gibson &amp; Vermeulen 
(2003) found that diversity was positively related to team learning behaviour 
whereas Van der Vegt &amp; Bunderson (2005) suggested that team learning behav-
iour mediated the relationship between expertise diversity and performance. Si-
multaneously, some researchers predict positive as well as negative effects of 
diversity: Polzer, Milton, &amp; Swann (2002) for example revealed that high inter-
personal congruence between diverse team/group members improved creative 
task performance while diversity undermined performance in teams/groups with 
low interpersonal congruence.

<p>Ely &amp; Thomas (2001) reported that according to each member's attitude toward 
diversity the effects on performance may be either positive or negative. 
Research into the positive and negative effects of diversity on performance has 
moved into separate directions and an integrative theoretical framework which 
helps to understand both directions seems to be missing e.g. (Guzzo &amp; Dickson, 
1996; Milliken &amp; Martins, 1996; Williams &amp; O'Reilly, 1998). Moreover, the 
highly inconsistent evidence for positive as well as negative effects of diversity 
is striking (Bowers, Pharmer, &amp; Salas, 2000; Webber &amp; Donahue, 2001; Wil-
liams &amp; O'Reilly, 1998). The context in which studies have been conducted has 
been widely neglected in explaining team/group dynamics which may be one 
reason for conflicting results across studies (Jackson et al., 2003). Another pos-
sible explanation could lie in the types of diversity studied and the role of inter-
vening variables affecting teamwork and performance. Additionally, Jackson et 
al. (2003) revealed in an extensive review on recent research into team and or-
ganisational diversity that the majority of the studies focused on a select diver-
sity attribute only. Studies on demographic and functional/educational dissimi-
larity were found to be predominant in literature (Jackson et al., 2003; Van 
Knippenberg, 2007). Rightly the latter argue that those studies fail to capture the 
full spectrum of diversity found in organisations. Van Knippenberg, deDreu, &amp; 
Homan (2004) went as far as to propose refraining from explaining the effects of 
diversity through typologies and dimensions of diversity. They promote giving 
up the strict distinction between a self categorisation perspective and an infor-
mation/decision-making perspective for a more integrative view of diversity. 
</p>
<p>Fau/tlines: Gender, Stereotypes, Language 
In a similar vain, Lau &amp; Murnighan (1998) suggested to go beyond the analysis 
of single characteristics and to investigate the interrelationship and effects of 
multiple characteristics to understand and to explain the dynamics and the effec-
tiveness of teams and groups. They introduced the term 'faultlines' which refers 
to a division of group member's on the basis of one or more attributes. The nov-
elty of the concept of faultlines is that groups with moderate diversity tend to 
experience more difficulties in establishing trust and managing conflict than 
groups with maximum diversity. In a highly culturally heterogeneous 
group/team, few common bases for categorisation, sub-group formation, self-
categorisation and social identity exist. Hence, members will try to establish a 
new shared understanding of processes, communication, role expectation, and 
the like (Earley &amp; Mosakowski, 2000). 
Moreover, Lau &amp; Mumighan (1998) argue that demographic faultlines may 
have their strongest effect at the beginning of a team's or group's life. Yet, if 
team and group members do not divide along demographic faultlines at the be-
ginning, other attributes such as gender, personality, religion or hobbies may 
determine the group's/team's faultline structure. For example, the emergence of

<p>gender faultlines may result in a division into male and female subgroups. The 
implementation of teams and groups in organisations has been accompanied by 
greater participation of females in work roles that traditionally were occupied by 
males (Hirschfeld, Jordan, Feild, Giles, &amp; Armenakis, 2006). Yet, the potential 
influence of gender on team and group outcomes has only been superficially re-
searched into and stereotypes seem to prevail. For instance, females tend to be 
regarded to have a lower capability to succeed than males (Chattopadhyay, Tlu-
chowska, &amp; George, 2004). Other stereotypes propose that sex is a more salient 
social category among women than men and that men are more competitive with 
one another than women (In: Chatman &amp; O'Reilly, 2004). 
Research has shown that social interaction is frequently accompanied by stereo-
types which directly influence perceptions. Other individuals are being catego-
rised on the basis of easily identifiable characteristics such as race, language or 
age. Stereotyping also means that all individuals of the categorised group are 
attributed with the same roles, characteristics and skills (Husemann, 1993). This 
way, stereotyping is a means to reduce complexity. In fact, if stereotypes are 
'right' individuals can react faster in a given situation. Moreover, they are said 
to be more beneficial when making comparisons between cultures than within 
cultures. However, they become counter productive if they do not get modified 
by individuals based on experience and observation in the course of team and 
group work (Adler, 2002) 
The concepts of faultlines and stereotypes are closely related to social identity 
theory (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986). On the one hand, individuals categorise them-
selves and hold multiple social identities which vary depending on context and 
situation (Garcia-Prieto, Bellard, &amp; Schneider, 2003). On the other hand, indi-
viduals categorise their team and group members into in-group and out-group 
members. Moreover, individuals use negative stereotypes to view out-group 
members as less attractive than in-group members and to maintain high levels of 
self esteem (Flynn, Chatman, &amp; Spataro, 2001 ). 
In multicultural teams, nationality and culture often trigger faultlines and indi-
viduals use cultural stereotypes to categorise each other. 
Randel (2003) proposed that culture was salient to those members of a multina-
tional team who had the same country of origin as either few or many fellow 
members. Further studies on cultural diversity looked at social interactive proc-
esses in multinational groups. Vallaster (2005) revealed that effective collabora-
tion between individuals of different nationalities occurs only when everybody 
understands and accepts the guiding principles or cultural values (Kirkman &amp; 
Shapiro, 2001) for their actions. Barinaga (2007) looked at two sides of the 
meaning of cultural difference in a multinational team. On the one hand, na-
tional culture stressed the sense of difference among group members whereas on 
the other hand it served to emphasize a sense of interdependency among group

<p>members. The 'national/cultural' discourse served both as a marker of distinc-
tion among group members and signified a sense of mutual dependency. 
Another aspect of diversity and identity, namely language, seems to be forgotten 
in research into teams and groups. 20 years ago, Holden (Holden, 1987) re-
marked in a review on research into language and linguistic issues in manage-
ment literature that these topics are treated with brevity by a very small number 
of authors only. 20 years later, Holden's remark still holds true. In fact, language 
studies have been treated as separate areas of research and not seen in the con-
text of organisational studies or group and team research (Peltokorpi, 2007). 
This is unfortunate as numerous challenges result from language diversity: a 
negative impact on interpersonal relations, trust and the socialisation process 
have been illuminated (Lagerstroem &amp; Andersson, 2003). Language and com-
munication competences become a major challenge in the socialisation process 
and when it comes to small talk. The interpretation of small talk in cross-
language communications triggers more problems than the discussion of techni-
cal issues (Henderson, 2005). Hence, if language is managed effectively it en-
hances team building and group cohesion (Goodall &amp; Roberts, 2003; Holden, 
2002). For instance, trust can be established by speaking the language of other 
team members from time to time even if it is not the main working language 
(Goodall &amp; Roberts, 2003). Nonetheless, even if all members share one common 
language, it is common that native speakers of one language will form closer 
relationships with each other, hence subgroups emerge (Chen, Geluykens, &amp; 
Choi, 2006). 
Overall research into teams and groups and the effects of language still is in its 
infancy. We agree with Chen et al. (2006) that effective communication prac-
tises need to be identified to manage language difficulties in teams and groups. 
Another weakness lies in the lack of knowledge of which aspects of language 
impact on team and group performance and to what extent. Moreover, the im-
pact of organisational, societal and cultural aspects on language and subse-
quently on performance is not yet investigated. 
</p>
<p>Personality 
The role of personality is another decisive issue related to diversity. According 
to existing literature there is evidence that specific personality traits are suppor-
tive for team and group work (Driskell, Goodwin, Salas, &amp; O'Shea, 2006). 
Other research suggests a moderating effect of personality on e.g. acculturation 
of expatriates (Caligiuri, 2000). 
One of the earliest investigations on the relationship between personality and 
team effectiveness were undertaken by Mann (1959) who found some 500 per-
sonality traits which have been measured in diverse studies conducted until that 
time. A reduction to the "Big Five" personality traits happened almost 40 years 
later when Costa &amp; McCrae (1992) discovered that there are about five basic but

<p>32 
</p>
<p>general dimensions that describe personality. These big five personality traits 
are emotional stability, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and 
conscientiousness which will be briefly explained. 
Extroversion: the extent to which a person is outgoing versus shy. High extro-
verts enjoy social situations while introverts avoid them. 
Emotional stability: the degree to which a person has appropriate emotional con-
trol. People with high emotional stability are self-confident and have high self-
esteem, while those with low emotional stability tend toward self-doubt. 
Agreeableness: the degree to which a person is friendly and approachable. 
Conscientiousness: the extent to which a person is responsible, dependable, mo-
tivated and achievement orientated. 
Openness to experience: the degree to which a person thinks flexibly and is re-
ceptive to new ideas. More open people tend toward creativity and action, less 
open people favour the status quo. 
These dimensions are relatively independent and proved to hold up cross-
culturally. Research has also found that the 'Big Five' are related to several 
work behaviours e.g. to work motivation (Judge &amp; Hies, 2002) and work satis-
faction (Judge, Heller, &amp; Mount, 2002). 
Many studies also refer to four respectively five dimensions established by 
Hofstede (200 I) which are individualism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, 
power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and long/short term orientation. As dis-
cussed in an interview between Hofstede &amp; Fink (2007) studies by Schwartz 
(1994) or the GLOBE study (House et al., 2004) include many more dimen-
sions. The interview revealed that the popularity of McCrae's Big Five lies in 
the limited number of dimensions which are easier to relate to and also easier to 
remember. This is also said to be true for the four dimensions established by 
Myers-Briggs, namely Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Think-
ing/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. 
The importance of a consideration of personality traits when hiring individuals 
who will be placed in a team has been investigated by Morgenson, Reider &amp; 
Campion (2005). They support the notion that the big five personality traits to-
gether with social skills and team work knowledge positively influence contex-
tual performance. Similarly, Neumann &amp; Wright (1999) stressed the importance 
of a consideration of personality traits when investigating team effectiveness. 
Their study proved that agreeableness and conscientiousness are predictive of 
effectiveness. 
However, research sometimes risks neglecting the fact that the statistical signifi-
cance of personality traits may be sensitive to other variables. For instance, per-
sonality traits and culture interact with each other and the question to ask is how 
this interaction shapes the relationship between individuals and subsequently the 
relationship within teams and groups. Moreover, Yuki (2002, p.203) writes: 
"hundreds of trait studies were conducted, but individual traits failed to correlate

<p>in a strong and consistent manner with leadership effectiveness". To answer how 
and why personality and leadership styles do (not) correlate would also be an 
interesting avenue for future research. 
</p>
<p>2.5. Discussion of literature 
In the following I aim to provide general conclusions drawn from the literature 
review on teams and groups and specific conclusions related to the further pro-
gress of this dissertation. 
</p>
<p>Clear definition of key terms 
The rather loose use of the terms "team" and "group" is the starting point of my 
argumentation. Researchers hardly make a reference to a definition of what 
makes a team or group as appendix 1 clearly shows. I conclude that it is a result 
of the lack of a common theoretical agreement on a definition of the terms 
"team" and "group". As argued earlier, the simple existence of two terms would 
justify a distinction. Nonetheless, it became common practice to use the terms 
interchangeably. Researchers may still give a different connotation to terms 
when they sample and even more when they interpret their findings. I argue that 
it does make a difference whether research is set in a self managed work team 
versus a team with an appointed leader or in a group of people who sometimes 
work together without having a common goal. The dynamics might clearly be 
very different. On a cultural level a clear connotation of the terms becomes even 
more important as different cultures have a different understanding of the con-
cept of team/group work and associate different underlying meanings with it 
(Gibson &amp; Zellmer-Bruhn, 2001) 
</p>
<p>Integration of dimensions 
A plethora of studies on demographic diversity and its effects on performance 
exists. At the same time, numerous studies on the influence of other factors on 
group processes exist. The second pillar of my argumentation corroborates that 
most studies look at one isolated dimension of team/group work only and that 
existing research into team/group performance lacks integrative research set-
tings. As discovered earlier, most studies on the outcomes of diversity focus 
solely on demographical variables. Most of them don't take into consideration 
interactive effects with other dimensions of diversity such as functional or indi-
vidual characteristics, see also Jackson et al. (2003). Out of 30 studies grouped 
in our category named diversity, 16 focus on demographic compositions only, 
five look at job related variables only, four studies involve demographic as well 
as job related issues, and a mere single study looks at individual aspects. That 
means that out of 30 studies 26 deal with pure diversity issues only. The point I 
wish to make is threefold: there is evidence for a tendency to conduct studies on 
specific variables, secondly these variables are looked at exclusively, and thirdly

<p>34 
</p>
<p>across all studies an integrative, conceptual model seems to be missing. It seems 
that research got stuck in dimensions and categories by conducting most studies 
in the same field with just slightly differing variables. Only few studies take into 
consideration a multi-dimension approach (Ely, 2004; Jehn et al., 1999; Kirk-
man &amp; Shapiro, 2001; Mathieu, 2006; Mendez, 2003; Randel &amp; Jaussi, 2003) 
and little pioneered on a multi-category approach (Harrison, Price, &amp; Bell, 1998; 
Jehn &amp; Bezrukova, 2004). 
</p>
<p>Contextualisation and moderators 
As extensively discussed in 2.4. l ., context is inescapable but at the same time 
tremendously neglected in contemporary research. Also, much is still unclear 
about the effects of diversity, and psychological factors etc. which are strength-
ened or weakened by moderators. Only recently research has started to examine 
the direct impact of variables of dimensions on team outcomes by also consider-
ing moderators. The set of moderator variables ranges from conflict norms (e.g.: 
Lovelace, Shapiro, &amp; Weingart, 200 l ), power centralisation (Bunderson, 2003 ), 
team work quality (Hoeg! &amp; Parboteeah, 2003), to task routineness and team 
longevity (e.g. Pelled, Eisenhardt &amp; Xin, 1999). Other moderators within this 
scope are team cohesiveness, team interdependence, and change orientation. 
Thus, moderators worth considering might be the feeling for time, the role of 
humour, and the role oflanguage. 
</p>
<p>Qualitative research 
It appears as if research into teams/groups has come to a stage of science charac-
terised by theory testing rather than theory building. As discussed earlier, social 
identity theory (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986) and self categorisation theory (Brewer, 
1979) prevail in this area ofresearch. Thus, quantitative methods dominate since 
they are particularly used to test theory (Creswell, 1994). Appendix l also 
clearly indicates this trend. Out of 96 studies the majority of around 70 studies 
followed a quantitative approach. Considering the wide range of questions still 
unanswered a theory building, qualitative research approach appears vital. This 
is for several reasons true in this specific research setting. To start off with, 
teamwork in the context of intergovernmental organisations is rather unex-
plored. Only two studies on teams and groups in the context of international or-
ganisations could be found (Elron, Halevy, Ari, &amp; Shamir, 2003; Neyer, 2004). 
However, the key word research in the journals in the field of public administra-
tion delivered no results. The six studies identified as being conducted in the 
public sector predominately focused on attitudinal behaviour. Armstrong-
Stassen, Wagar &amp; Cattaneo (2004) looked for example at the effects of downsiz-
ing on work-group membership while Klein, Lim, Saltz &amp; Mayer (2004) inves-
tigated into networks in teams. Carless &amp; De Paola (2000) illuminated the 
measurement of cohesion in work teams. Hohmann, Bordia &amp; Gallois (2003)

</p>
<p>focused on value dissimilarity, others on team member schema agreement 
(Rentsch &amp; Klimoski, 2001) or compliance and contextual performance (Van 
Emmerik, Lambooy, &amp; Sanders, 2002). Those studies clearly provide valuable 
insights but are far away from being integrative as argued further above. 
Since the key word search on teams/groups in intergovernmental organisations 
did not provide a lot of results I undertook a general review on research into the 
field of public administration. A number of studies have compared structural 
characteristics of public and private organisations. Some of the most eminent 
researchers propose that public and private organisations are more similar than 
different from each other (according to Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000). Other re-
searchers who examined for example decision making practices in public and 
private organisations reported notable differences (Nutt, 2005). Again, divergent 
opinions and research findings make it hard to bridge to the possible dynamics 
in teams and groups. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, the findings of the literature review bring me to the following 
conclusions: 
</p>
<p>&bull; Teams and/or groups in organisations are a widely investigated field 
across disciplines. However, research into teams and/or groups in inter-
governmental organisations hardly exists. As argued throughout this lit-
erature review, the context of a study appears to be the crucial part of it. 
Therefore the aim of this dissertation is to investigate whether phenomena 
associated with team/group work in the context of private organisations 
also apply to the context of an intergovernmental organisation. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The interchangeable use of the terms "team" and "group" which might be 
the result of a lack of a common definition needs to be addressed again. I 
argue if academia is not able to find a consensus on whether or not the 
two terms theoretically may be seen as two different concepts of work 
units and as a result be labelled with a clear definition, or whether the 
terms may be used interchangeably, a not very well defined starting point 
of research will continue to lead to not completely accurately interpretable 
results. Even more so considering that different cultures connote different 
meanings to the concept of team and/or group work. I therefore let my in-
terviewees speak and aim to provide clarification on whether or not indi-
viduals perceive to be part of a team or group. Based on the experiences 
and perceptions of the sample of individuals working in an intergovern-
mental organisation I attempt to provide a clear definition for the specific 
context.

</p>
<p>&bull; The findings of the literature research suggest predominantly a non - inte-
grative research approach. As argued many times before, only specific as-
pects of team and group work and its outcome on performance have been 
looked at. The aim of this study is to approach this topic in a different 
way by looking at three main aspects of team and group work: organisa-
tional aspects, managerial aspects and individual aspects. I argue that only 
an integrative view of aspects allows conclusions on the dynamics in the 
work units. Furthermore, the identification of moderators and the open-
ness for asymmetric relationships will play a vital role in generating an in-
tegrative model. 
</p>
<p>As a logical consequence, an exploratory, qualitative study with clear definitions 
of the key terms of investigation, a rich contextual explanation and an integra-
tive view of as many dimensions as possible seems to be appropriate and more-
over necessary.

<p>III. Research Methodology, Method, Research Design and Re-
search Context 
</p>
<p>3.1. Introduction 
</p>
<p>This chapter aims to develop the methodological framework of this research set-
ting which focuses on team and group work in an intergovernmental organisa-
tion, and will present the research methods used. The design of the study will be 
presented as well as a description of the sample and the research context. 
</p>
<p>3.2. Methodology: Grounded Theory 
</p>
<p>Strauss and Corbin (1994, p.273) defined grounded theory as a "general meth-
odology for developing theory that is grounded in data systematically gathered 
and analysed". The procedures of grounded theory are designed to develop a 
well integrated set of concepts that provide a thorough theoretical explanation of 
social phenomena under study (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 1990). Directly linked to this 
methodology is the term constant comparative method which connotes an inter-
related process of data collection and analysis, an interaction between theory and 
data and an interplay of deduction and induction. 
There are many advantages in using grounded theory. The selection of this 
methodology for this research setting has been directed by the following three 
motives: 
</p>
<p>&bull; Grounded theory helps to develop theoretical explanations of the situa-
tions being investigated and is so close to those studied that the theory is 
of use to them (Turner, 1981 ). 
</p>
<p>&bull; The objective of this study is to build an integrative model of how 
team/group work is practised in an intergovernmental organisation. Since 
relatively little is known about "why" and "how" teams/ groups work ( or 
do not) in this specific context, the choice for grounded theory seems to 
be appropriate. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Grounded theory as a practical method focuses on the interpretive process 
by analysing "the actual production of meanings and concepts used by so-
cial actors in real settings" (Gephart, 2004, p.457). 
</p>
<p>The process of theory building using grounded theory methodology can very 
briefly be described as follows: 
Grounded theory is all about discovery and grounds a theory in reality (Glaser &amp; 
Strauss, 1967). Therefore, the research begins with an area of study and a not 
well defined theory. As soon as the first data within this area of study is col-
lected, analysis begins. In the following, data collection and analysis are interre-

<p>38 
</p>
<p>lated processes. This parallel process enables the researcher to capture all poten-
tially relevant aspects of the research topic. Each aspect discovered earns its way 
into the theory by repeatedly being present or by being significantly absent 
(Corbin &amp; Strauss, 1990). In the next step, data is conceptualised by comparing 
incidents and naming them. These concepts may then be grouped into categories 
by comparing, reducing and specifying them. Over time, categories can become 
related to one another and form a theory (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 1990). 
</p>
<p>3.2.2. Method - Case Study 
</p>
<p>Case studies are a useful research method when the research topic is well stud-
ied but a fresh perspective is needed, or when little is known of the phenomenon 
under study. Furthermore, a case study is a research strategy which aims to un-
derstand the dynamics within single settings (Eisenhardt, 1989). Thus, a case 
study can either involve single or multiple cases and numerous levels of analy-
sis, e.g.: organisation and individual (Yin, 1984 ). Case studies allow for qualita-
tive as well as quantitative data collection and analysis. Finally, case studies 
may be used to test theory (Pinfield, 1986) or to generate theory (Gersick, 1988). 
According to Eisenhardt (1989), at the beginning of a case study based on the 
methodology of grounded theory, it is important to start as theory free as possi-
ble. A researcher should of course identify a research area and should formulate 
a research question and possibly identify some potentially important variables. 
Yet, the researcher should avoid thinking about theories or relationships be-
tween variables as much as possible. When selecting a case, Stake (1995) de-
scribes a choice of three types of case studies: a) intrinsic cases which focus on 
the uniqueness of a particular case aiming to understand solely the case itself, b) 
instrumental cases which offer insight into a substantive issue and enable to ad-
vance theory and c) collective cases which investigate into several cases and al-
low a comparison between cases. 
Having explained the characteristics of a case study, I believe that the study of 
team and group work in an intergovernmental organisation is predestined for a 
case study for the following reasons: Teams and groups have been extensively 
studied over the past decades but not in the specific context of intergovernmen-
tal organisations. To understand how individuals co-work in this specific envi-
ronment justifies the application of a so called intrinsic case study. Qualitative 
research with embedded units of analysis will be applied to show whether exist-
ing theory in the context of multinational corporations proofs to be valid in the 
context of an intergovernmental organisation. Finally, a case study based on 
grounded theory will allow for new theory building.

<p>3.2.3. Objectivity, reliability, validity, and generalisability 
Qualitative research often has been criticised as lacking in objectivity, reliabil-
ity, validity, and generalisibility as opposed to hypothesis falsification used in 
postpositivism (Gephart, 2004). However, respecting a consistency between 
methodology and method and a thorough application of qualitative research 
methods may weaken this criticism. 
To deal with the weaknesses of interpretive research, I followed the recommen-
dations by Hussey, &amp; Hussey ( 1997), Yin (1984 ), Miles, &amp; Huberman (1994 ). 
</p>
<p>&bull; Thorough explanation of methods used in study 
&bull; Respecting and following the rules of applied methods 
&bull; Documentation of all study materials (interviews, memos, assumptions

<p>and interpretations during analysis etc.) 
&bull; Triangulation by using different sources of data 
&bull; Audit of entire study 
</p>
<p>To keep as much objectivity as possible is a challenge for the researcher con-
ducting interpretive research. Therefore, to avoid biases during the interview and 
during analysis, attention was paid by thoroughly following the rules of the 
methods applied. Reliability refers to the extent to which the results obtained 
could be repeated by another researcher. Validity, the core indicator in qualita-
tive research (Bortz &amp; Doring, 2002), refers to the extent to which research find-
ings accurately reflect the happenings in a specific context (Hussey &amp; Hussey, 
1997). Validity in this research setting could be provided by respecting the five 
rules mentioned above. Finally, generalisibility is not a main concern of qualita-
tive studies as this research method values the integration of a specific context 
and there is no primary concern about conducting the same research in com-
pletely different contexts. 
Triangulation by using different sources of data (internal reports, internal case 
studies, books and press reports) was vital to provide reliable results. Last but 
not least, discussions with experts in the field ( e.g. supervisors, lecturers, and 
staff of the UN not included in the sample) helped the researcher to cross-check 
conclusions.

</p>
<p>&bull; Factors which are a barrier, a trigger, and/or influence team and group 
work. 
</p>
<p>Due to the fact that relatively little is known about team and group work in in-
tergovernmental organisations a qualitative research approach was chosen. 
Qualitative research aims to explain social reality by learning from the people's 
experiences (Flick, Karldorff, &amp; Steineke, 2000). Thus, qualitative research al-
lows gathering deep insights by considering context and situational factors and 
as a result theory can be generated in a context in which little is known about the 
phenomena under investigation (Eisenhardt, 1989). Qualitative methods have 
been defined as procedures for "coming to terms with the meaning not the fre-
quency" of a phenomenon by studying it in its social context (Van Maanen, 
1983, p.9). 
To set up this research design as a case study based on semi-structured in depth 
interviews has been driven by the arguments above as well as the underlying 
methodological assumptions. 
The research design for this study comprises four iterative stages: 
</p>
<p>&bull; field research: semi-structured interviews in 3 headquarters of an inter-
governmental organisation 
</p>
<p>&bull; desk research: literature review on teams and groups in multinational or-
ganisations 
</p>
<p>&bull; data analysis using constant comparative method 
&bull; development of propositions and a model 
</p>
<p>3.3.1. Semi-structured interviews 
Grounded theory research is typically associated with collecting data through 
interviews (Osland &amp; Osland, 2001). In personal interviews the interviewer is 
the research instrument and the interview is an opportunity to enter the mind of 
another and to see the world as they see it (McCracken, 1988). Consequently, 
this technique proves to be a valid tool to gather a broad understanding of the 
context the interviewees act in as well as related phenomena. 
</p>
<p>Interviewing 
Grounded theory demands the researcher to enter the field of study without hav-
ing any pre- existing theoretical assumptions (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967). Although 
I argue that it is difficult to conceive of any researcher to start a study with a 
theory-free mind I conducted the first five interviews without reading related 
literature. The first interviews were general in nature and mostly consisted of an 
introductory question which aimed to form a brief overview of the topic under 
study. According to Mayring (2002) this narrative approach allows the inter-

</p>
<p>viewee to openly and freely respond to the overall research question without be-
ing restricted by the interviewer. Following constant comparative method I ana-
lysed the interviews, linked them to literature and developed an interview guide 
for the next set of interviews. This basic list proved to be a helpful tool during 
interviews to make sure that all relevant topics were covered. However, a second 
round of interviews opened new views of the construct under investigation 
which I then again linked to literature and included in the interview guide. The 
final interview guide developed this way and has been used for the remaining 
sets of interviews (see appendix 2). 
The interview comprised three main parts. 
The first set of questions was aimed at the individual and his/her work environ-
ment. A short description of the people the interviewees work with usually led 
them to tell a related story. This made them feel comfortable and in the course of 
telling the story they naturally gave hints relating to the set of questions which 
was aimed at team work. Also, the interviewer could learn about the personality 
of the interviewee. 
The second set of questions was designed to capture the role and set up of team 
work and to make the interviewee define what a 'team' means to him/her. An 
important aspect of this set of questions turned out to be the role of management 
that will be explained in more detail in the analysis of the data. 
The third set of questions focused on the structure of the organisation and the 
impact of bureaucracy and red tape on the work place and team situation. Lastly, 
I asked the interviewees what they would wish to change in their work environ-
ment if they were in a position of power. 
After the interview was over and the interviewee left, I immediately took notes 
on the demographics of the interviewee and the interview situation. The latter 
included observations made during the interview or remarks which seemed im-
portant to understand the context of the interview (see appendix 3). 
</p>
<p>Challenges 
Applying the method of semi-structured interviews on the one hand makes sure 
to cover all areas of interest during the interview. The interview guide can be 
used to direct the conversation so that it stays on course. At the same time this 
technique leaves enough freedom for the interviewees to come up with unex-
pected descriptions and arguments. However, this technique challenges skills: 
the interviewer always needs to keep in mind the focus and goal of the inter-
view. At the same time the interviewer should take advantage of the fact that 
most people like to talk about themselves (Bewley, 2002) and should keep the 
interviewee engaged and not constrained by persistent questioning. The inter-
viewer constantly needs to find a balance between getting an answer to all ques-
tions and leaving the interviewee enough freedom to tell his/her story. Simulta-

<p>42 
</p>
<p>neously, the interviewee needs to keep track of the content of the interviewee's 
narratives and already formulate the next questions in her head. 
</p>
<p>Another challenge is to find interviewees who are willing to tell their story 
(Hermanowicz, 2002). Many people are willing to give an interview only if 
promised strict confidentiality (Bewley, 2002). The interviewer needs to assure 
confidentiality and anonymity in the introductory letter. It should engage the 
potential interviewees by making sure that their expert knowledge is needed and 
valued. During the interview it is important to create a comfortable atmosphere 
by asking introductory questions and by conducting small talk. As most people 
are busy it is important to sustain their interest throughout the interview by 
maintaining eye contact and also by inviting the interviewee to bring up new 
topics (Bewley, 2002). Furthermore, the questions need to be formulated in a 
way that the interviewees can understand them, and the questions need to be 
about topics the interviewees can meaningfully respond to. 
</p>
<p>A further topic that needs to be handled with care is the recording of interviews. 
Interviewees must give permission for recording. Some people might not feel 
comfortable and this has to be respected by the interviewer. If interviewees do 
not mind being recorded, it still is advisable to take notes during and after the 
interview because the best equipment may fail and sometimes informants may 
change their minds about recording (Wilkinson &amp; Young, 2004). 
</p>
<p>Biases 
When interviewing, one always needs to keep in mind the biases which go hand 
in hand with this technique. In the following I would like to point out the main 
biases which have to be taken into consideration for this research setting, 
namely the cross-cultural and context bias. 
</p>
<p>Cross-cultural bias 
As this study is set in a multicultural intergovernmental organisation, the re-
searcher might be tempted to interview a variety of people from different cul-
tural backgrounds to cover as many views as possible. However, cross cultural 
interviews add another dimension to the already fairly difficult technique of in-
terviewing: culture. If the interviewer has a different cultural background as the 
interviewee, there is the risk that both persons attribute different meanings and 
interpretations to the content of the interview. This so called construct bias oc-
curs 'if there is only partial overlap in the definitions of the construct across cul-
tures' (Van de Vijver &amp; Tanzer, 1997) and it can only be avoided if both people 
in an interview situation belong to the same culture. Moreover, interviews across 
cultures are very likely to be held in languages other than the mother tongue. 
Either one part of the party or both parts need to express themselves in a second

</p>
<p>language; hence, misunderstandings and misinterpretations are very likely to 
happen, and as a consequence interviewer and response biases arise. Overall 'the 
choice and use of language as well as the researcher's and the interviewee's lan-
guage skills affect the dynamics of the interview' (Marschan-Piekkari &amp; Reis, 
2004). Furthermore, the interviewer also risks neglecting non-verbal communi-
cation. As a consequence, Fink et al., (2004) recommend refraining from con-
ducting cross-cultural interviews to avoid cross-cultural biases unless the com-
mon third language is spoken fluently and both the researcher and interviewee 
are familiar with the second culture. 
</p>
<p>Social desirability bias 
Social desirability can be explained as the tendency of individuals to describe 
themselves and the organisation they work for in a more attractive manner than 
they are in reality (Schwab, 1999). Especially personal or sensitive questions are 
prone for leading the respondent to answer socially desirable. 
In this research, cooperation with other individuals and work in teams/groups 
can be seen as a personal issue for interviewees. Consequently, related questions 
may be exposed to social desirability bias. Keeping this in mind is particularly 
vital during analysis and interpretation of the data. 
</p>
<p>Context bias 
Context as specified by Cappelli &amp; Sherer ( 1991, p.56) is 'the surroundings as-
sociated with phenomena which help to illustrate that phenomena'. As widely 
acknowledged and also argued throughout the literature review, qualitative re-
search -contrarily to quantitative research - is capable of capturing contextual 
factors (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994; Yin, 1994). Therefore, context is a vital part 
of qualitative research and makes models more accurate and the interpretation of 
results more robust (Schneider, 1985). 
Marschan-Piekkari, Welch &amp; Tahvanainen (2004) suggest considering context 
at four different levels. Interview context being a potential source of bias will be 
explained first, followed by three other closely interwoven levels (individual 
context, organisational context, and external context). 
The interview context as such can be described by situational variables such as 
the location in which the interview takes place, the time of the day, the amount 
of time the interviewee allows, the mood both parties are in and the interper-
sonal dynamics during the interview. While the location and time of the meeting 
can be arranged, the interviewer has no influence on interruptions during the 
meeting, last minute obligations on the side of the interviewee; not to mention 
the mood of the interviewer and interviewee the day the interview takes place. 
Furthermore, interviews are an arena of power relations. The interviewee might 
want to impose his or her meta-communicative norms on the interviewer 
(Yeung, 1995) which is particularly the case when interviewing elites. It is often

</p>
<p>assumed that the more senior the interviewer the more he or she knows 
(MacDonald &amp; Hellgren, 2004). Others argue that top management may not al-
ways know most about what is going on in the organisation and, therefore, sug-
gest interviewing other staff in the hierarchy (eg.: Macdonald &amp; Hellgren, 
2004). These aspects are part of the individual context of an interview referring 
to education, profession, hierarchical status and power of both the interviewee 
and the interviewer. Bewley (2002) for example reported that being a professor 
made interviewing very rewarding for him as interviewees paid a lot of respect 
to him because of the fact that he is academic. By contrast, my professor often 
argued that professors may represent a certain degree of authority which might 
intimidate some interviewees from answering the way they feel. They might fear 
of answering "un-academically" or they might assume that the professor is hid-
ing his/her knowledge. 
At the second level, the type of organisation under study (its size, structure, 
strategy, culture, and history) forms the organisational context of the interview 
(Marschan-Piekkari et al., 2004). A thorough consideration and description of 
the organisational context is suggested (Rousseau &amp; Fried, 200 l ). The latter 
ones argue that organisational factors are very often taken for granted by the in-
terviewer who fails to consider organisational influences during the interview. 
The same may also apply to interviewees who may personalise events and ex-
clude organisational effects. Contrary to the organisational context, which is also 
known as inner context, the external (or outer) context encompasses the national 
culture, the political and economic environment in which organisations are em-
bedded (Pettigrew, 1985). A constant consideration of the external context dur-
ing analysis is recommended in order to avoid false assumptions. 
To avoid biases, a rich description and consideration of context on all four levels 
during the interview as well as during analysis is highly recommended. This is 
even more so in qualitative research which demands a rich description of con-
text. 
</p>
<p>3.3.2. Data Analysis - Constant Comparative Method 
</p>
<p>With the permission of interviewees, interviews were recorded, transcribed and 
linked to personal characteristics: demographic ones such as age, gender, educa-
tion and functional characteristics such as position, experience. 
The text material was fed into software Atlas.ti, Version 5, which helps to code, 
match and administer qualitative research data. It allows to quantify the findings 
and to draw network views. The software does assist in data analysis such as 
data reduction, categorisation and administration, but the actual analysis, inter-
pretation and theory building is in the hands of the user of the software.

</p>
<p>Constant Comparative Method 
As described in the seminal work of Glaser &amp; Strauss (1967) four stages of con-
stant comparative method have been respected throughout the data analysis: 
</p>
<p>1. Comparing incidents applicable to each category 
2. Integrating categories and their properties 
3. Delimiting the theory 
4. Writing the theory 
</p>
<p>Step 1: Comparing incidents applicable to each category 
The beginning of analysis using constant comparative method is dominated by 
the discovery and creation of codes through interpretation of data. As explained 
by Hussey, &amp; Hussey (1997) codes serve to enable the data to be segmented, 
compiled and organised. Strauss &amp; Corbin (1990) talk about three different 
kinds of codes: open codes, axial codes and selective codes. Open codes are the 
basic form of codes which come from the researcher's own imagination or from 
literature (vivo codes). In the course of open coding, the researcher assigns 
names to contexts, events, activities or stories found in the data. The analytic 
process of open coding leads to an identification of concepts which are the basis 
for the development of theory. In a next step, through axial coding, the re-
searcher tries to make connections between categories. Once again this is an it-
erative process and the researcher goes back and forth between open and axial 
coding. In a last step, selective coding results in the development of a core code 
which is the central phenomenon that has emerged from axial coding. 
The coding process involves both inductive and deductive thinking. Inductive 
thinking means that categories, themes and patterns emerge from the data mate-
rial itself whereas deductive thinking verifies existing theory and frameworks 
against the data (Fink et al., 2004; Patton, 2002). Furthermore, coding and cate-
gorising shows a constant interplay between proposing and checking as ex-
plained by Glaser &amp; Strauss (1967, p. 106): 'While coding an incident for a 
category, compare it with the previous incidents in the same and different 
groups coded in the same category' 
A constant comparison leads the researcher to generate theoretical properties: 
the researcher may eventually relate categories to each other and start to think in 
terms of the full range of types of categories, their dimensions and their major 
consequences. 
After coding for a category for possibly several times, Glaser and Strauss ( 1967, 
p. 107) suggest stopping to code and, instead, to recording a memo of the re-
searcher's own ideas. 'The analyst should take as much time as necessary to re-
flect and carry his thinking to its most logical (grounded in the data, not specula-
tive) conclusion.' Furthermore, it is advised to write memos throughout the 
process of analysis to illustrate the researcher's ideas.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46 
</p>
<p>Step 2: Integrating categories and their properties 
As the coding continues, constant comparison causes categories to become re-
lated to other categories and as a result accumulated knowledge is built up. As 
different categories become integrated, the researcher can start to develop theory 
(Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967, p. 109). 
</p>
<p>Step 3: Delimiting the theory 
This step is mostly characterised by reduction, which comprises bundling cate-
gories to a smaller set of higher level concepts. Consequently, reduction leads to 
a more precise terminology. Thus, the researcher complies with two require-
ments of theory: parsimony of variables and their formulation and scope in the 
applicability ofthe theory to a wide range of situations (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1979, 
p.111). 
</p>
<p>Step 4: Writing theory 
After having carefully respected the first three stages, the researcher finally ar-
rives at writing a theory based on the categories developed, their relation to each 
other and their integration to a whole concept. The content behind the categories 
is provided by the memos which represent the major themes of the theory 
(Glaser&amp;Strauss, 1979,p.113). 
</p>
<p>3.3.3. Sample 
As this study deals with team and group work and the conditions under which 
this type of work is enhanced (or not), I decided to conduct interviews at a 
macro-level unit of analysis. Hence, 50 semi-structured, face to face and indi-
vidual interviews in three locations of five Organisations of the United Nations 
were conducted between June 2005 and June 2006. To avoid a cross-cultural 
bias, the decision was made to only interview Austrian and German employees. 
Contacts were made through networking and 50 interviews could be conducted. 
All interviews were conducted by the author and lasted between 45 minutes to 2 
hours. The interviews mostly took place in the cafes of each of the three loca-
tions visited. With permission, interviews were recorded and taped. Total ano-
nymity was promised in every case. 
The demographics and functional characteristics among the people interviewed 
are very diverse and the sample represents a wide variety of staff members. 
Table 3 below summarises the characteristics of the interviewee sample:

<p>3.4. Research Context 
The interviews took place in three locations of the United Nations, namely in 
Vienna, Geneva and New York. At a lower organisational level, five organisa-
tional units were chosen: the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 
Vienna, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in New York, the 
United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) in Vienna, the 
United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in New York, and the

<p>World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in Geneva. The reason for this 
choice was twofold: first, the huge body of principle organs of the United Na-
tions System with its numerous related agencies, organisations and programmes 
cannot possibly be investigated by a single researcher within the limitations of a 
single research project. However, to get a broader understanding of the structure 
and culture of the United Nations Organisation it seemed necessary to conduct 
interviews in different types of units. Therefore, I aimed to conduct interviews in 
agencies, programmes and organisations with diverse functions, diverse struc-
tures, and diverse cultures and last but not least, diverse locations. 
Second, within these units a sufficiently large number of German speaking staff 
who were willing to give interviews could be identified. 
The following details aim to describe briefly the history of the United Nations 
Organisation and its structure as well as the diverse units under investigation. 
</p>
<p>Context 
'The United Nations Organisation (UN) is an international organisation bringing 
together 191 states which have committed themselves voluntarily to a mutual 
obligation to safeguard peace and humane living conditions for the people of the 
world' (Gareis &amp; Varwick, 2005). 
In June 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, 50 founding members gave birth 
to the United Nations by signing the Charter of the United Nations in San Fran-
cisco. Over the years, a further 140 states have become members of this inter-
governmental organisation. 
</p>
<p>The United Nations System consists of six primary organs which will briefly be 
explained in the following (source: (Gareis &amp; Varwick, 2005): 
</p>
<p>&bull; The General Assembly: intergovernmental forum for consultation and co-
operation. All member states are represented equally by one vote per 
state. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The Security Council: responsible for world peace and international secu-
rity. 5 permanent and 10 non-permanent member states; meets on a daily 
basis. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The Economic and Social Council: works together with General Assem-
bly on economic and social topics; 54 members. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The International Court of Justice: primary juridical organ of the UN, 
consist of 15 independent judges appointed by Security Council and Gen-
eral Assembly. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The Secretariat: main administrative organ. The Secretary-General is 
elected by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security 
Council and serves for 5 years. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Note: The Trusteeship Council: suspended its work in 1994 after the tran-
sition of the last trustee

<p>49 
</p>
<p>Apart from these 5 main organs, the United Nations System also consists of 
various, sometimes independent, decentralised organisations and programmes, 
each with its own by-laws, membership, structure and budget (Gareis &amp; Var-
wick, 2005). 
</p>
<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
The first United Nations Organisation to be located in Vienna was the IAEA in 
1957. The IAEA counts as an autonomous, international organisation within the 
United Nations System and the two bodies consult each other. A special agree-
ment between the UN and the IAEA governs their relationship with regards to 
reporting, exchange of information, cooperation, technical assistance, budgetary 
and financial agreements and personnel arrangements. The IAEA is responsible 
for international activities concerned with the peaceful uses of atomic energy. It 
finances itself out of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions. The 
IAEA reports to the Security Council and the General Assembly. (Source: 
[www.iaea.org] downloaded 15.05.2007) 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
The UNDP emerged in 1965 as an independent instrument for the planning, fi-
nancing and coordination of development projects. It specifically administers the 
technical part of these projects which aim to fight poverty and to improve living 
conditions. The funds for the projects are based on grants which do not have to 
be repaid by the developing countries. The UNDP has no formal membership. It 
is financed through the voluntary contributions of member states. The central 
office is in New York but it has offices in more than 130 countries and is in-
volved in some 5.000 projects at any given time (Gareis &amp; Varwick, 2005). 
UNDP reports directly to the General Assembly and has a non-subsidiary rela-
tionship with the Economic and Social Council.

<p>United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) 
UNIDO was established in 1966 as an organ of the General Assembly. Like the 
IAEA, UNIDO functions as an autonomous organisation within the United Na-
tions. Its permanent headquarter is in Vienna. UNIDO is represented in 50 de-
veloping countries (thereof predominantly in Africa). The two main areas of ac-
tivities are to strengthen industrial capacities and to encourage cleaner and sus-
tainable industrial development. 
Funding for UNIDO activities is drawn from the regular budget, the operational 
budget, and voluntary contributions. (Source: [www.unido.org], downloaded

<p>United Nations Office for Project Services (UNO PS) 
UNOPS was established as a self-financing unit at the beginning of 1995 and 
provides operational management services such as reduction of red tape, loan 
administration and supervision, but also protection of international waters and 
biodiversity or electoral assistance. The clients of UNOPS are United Nations 
System partners such as UNDP, UNICEF, UNESCO and country governments. 
UNOPS is self-financing and charges fees on estimates of the actual costs of 
rendering services to a client. UNOPS reports directly to the General Assembly.

<p>World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) 
In 1967 WIPO was established by the WIPO Convention to promote the protec-
tion of Intellectual Property. The headquarters is located in Geneva. WIPO is a 
specialised agency of the United Nations dedicated to developing an accessible 
international intellectual property system among its member states. This in-
cludes development of international laws and treaties regarding patents, trade-
marks, and industrial designs, copyright and related issues. WIPO administers 
fee-based services based on international agreements which enable users in 
member countries to file international applications for patents and international 
registrations for trademarks, designs, and appellations of origin. WIPO is largely 
self-financing with 90 percent of the budget coming from earning from provided 
services. (Source: [www.wipo.int], downloaded 15.05.2007) 
</p>
<p>Table 4 summarises the main characteristics of the organisational units de-
scribed. It shows that these five units differ in many ways: the choice of units 
covers a United Nations programme (UNDP), an office (UNOPS), an agency 
(IAEA), and two organisations (WIPO, UNIDO). The units not only differ by 
the status of the entities under investigation within the United Nations System 
but also in the way they are financed (self financing and/or regular budget), with 
regards to their main area of work (internal and/or external) and their function 
(technical and/or services). Last but not least, they are also located in different 
headquarters.

<p>IV. Empirical Findings - Data Analysis 
</p>
<p>4.1. Introduction 
</p>
<p>This chapter forms the vantage point for the development of theory on teams 
and groups in an intergovernmental organisation. The analysis procedure of 50 
qualitative, semi-structured interviews followed the grounded theory and con-
stant comparative method approach as formulated in the methodology and 
methods part. 
As argued throughout the previous chapters, at the heart of qualitative research 
and data analysis is a rich description. Therefore, emphasis will be put on the 
explanation of the development of patterns and their implications. 
This chapter will start with answering the question whether or not group/team 
work exists in the investigated Organisations of the United Nations. The aim is 
to provide a definition for the constructs revealed during this research. Further-
more, the factors which enhance or hinder team/group work in this specific con-
text will be explored and described. Moreover, it will be tested whether phe-
nomena discovered in a non-governmental environment are also valid in an in-
tergovernmental environment. 
Finally, results of the findings of the analysis will be aggregated into a concep-
tual model. 
</p>
<p>4.2. Team or group work? A typology grounded in the data 
The first research question 'Do teams/groups in the United Nations exist and if 
so, what are they like?' forms the point of departure of this research. The stories 
told by 50 individuals working in five different Organisations in the United Na-
tions were analysed in detail to clarify which kinds of team and group work are 
practised. 
The explanation of how team and group work is perceived in five United Na-
tions Organisations will be developed in a threefold manner. Firstly, those char-
acteristics will be explained that the majority of all interviewees relate to team 
and group work. Single quotes that best capture the content of these characteris-
tics will be used as illustrations. Secondly, this study reverses the direction of 
discussion by evaluating characteristics of team and group work which were re-
ported to be missing. Thirdly, the characteristics reported will be compared with 
theoretical definitions of team and group work. The analysis concludes in a ty-
pology of constructs.

<p>Step I: How do individuals perceive team and group work 
</p>
<p>TYPOLOGY 
</p>
<p>The first step of data analysis revealed that the basic question "Do you work in a 
team or group" could not be answered straight forward. The most common ap-
proach interviewees chose to answer the question was to describe the hierarchi-
cal position of both co-workers and supervisors and to list the different nation-
alities interviewees work with. The following quote is a typical sample for a re-
sponse: 
</p>
<p>Well, I had a supervisor from Sweden and then from Belgium. [ ... ] 
And my colleague from Haiti has been here for a while as well. 
(P9:06) 
</p>
<p>Another pattern which emerged in this first step of analysis is that interviewees 
tried to position themselves as a specific type of member of a team or group. 
The narratives would start with 'I am ... ' and result in a self-categorisation of 
interviewees as either a member or a leader of a team or group. 
</p>
<p>I work with 5 technical officers in a group and in collaboration with 
another officer. (P20: 19). 
</p>
<p>I am a group leader. (P26: 17) 
</p>
<p>I am a team leader of 5 persons. (P35: 11) 
</p>
<p>I am part of a planning team in a project. (P4 l: 13) 
</p>
<p>90 % of interviewees then described their tasks and responsibilities. They were 
of a very different nature depending on the Organisation the interviewees

<p>54 
</p>
<p>worked for and depending on the type of staff the interviewees belong to. How-
ever, and regardless of the function of interviewees, two patterns emerged. On 
the one hand, interviewees highlighted the importance of management as the 
main factor of whether or not team and group work functions. Interviewees re-
ferred to the responsibility of a team and group leader to develop processes 
within the team and group to make it work. These processes are among others 
the communication style, the extent to which information is shared among staff, 
the coordination of tasks or the way how decisions are made. The quote below 
refers to how the likehood of conflicts has been reduced by setting up specific 
processes: 
</p>
<p>I have learned to direct certain team processes right from the begin-
ning before team work degenerates into chaos and conflict. (Pl9:28) 
</p>
<p>The narratives around management were numerous and extensive and will be 
explained in more detail in the course of the data analysis. 
On the other hand, an element of team and group work alludes to personality of 
individuals as a factor of whether or not team and group work is construed, and 
how it is accomplished. All interviewees reported at some stage that the person-
ality of co-workers was a crucial element in group functioning. Personality was 
explained to be a stronger factor of influence than nationality and hierarchy. 
Personality too will be explained in more detail in the further course of this 
analysis. 
</p>
<p>The first step of data analysis further showed that around 60% of all interview-
ees interpretations of team and group work can be categorised around two inter-
twined behaviours which interviewees relate to team and group work: communi-
cation and coordination. According to the majority of the interviewees, commu-
nication involves the exchange of information and knowledge among the mem-
bers of a team and group. 
</p>
<p>In my view, collaboration in teams stands for transfer of thoughts and 
knowledge. (P17:22) 
</p>
<p>A distribution of information provides each member with the information that is 
necessary to fulfil a task. The interviewee below accentuates equal treatment of 
all members in a network: 
</p>
<p>... equality for all, everyone gets information on anything and partici-
pates. Whether or not they are able to participate is another question 
but there is no separation of information. No. there is a network in 
which everyone is equal. When we plan a project all of our colleagues

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>55 
</p>
<p>work on it, everyone adds a part and everyone corrects the others ... 
(P29:26) 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the exchange of information is described as being intensive in order 
to gain as much background as possible: 
</p>
<p>It is a process, which consists of a lot of exchange with the person that 
stands between XX and the American who does the analysis. Also, 
there is a lot of exchange because this person has been working here 
for a long time and knows a great deal. He is Austrian. And I person-
ally, try to understand the background of everything and to develop 
myself because I have not been working here for a long time. This 
means for me constant questioning why things are the way they are. 
[ ... ] the rest is operational work which I do all by myself. (P 11: 120) 
</p>
<p>The means of communication may vary from email to written reports or meet-
ings (reported by 90 % of interviewees). 
The extent to which team and group members share information among them-
selves depends on the coordination of the team and group with regard to tasks 
and resources: 
</p>
<p>Each person is allocated specific tasks. For example a press confer-
ence is being organised - I need to inform the media, I have good con-
tacts with Austrian and international media. Interviews need to be or-
ganised and the TV stations as well. Each person always has the same 
task and knows what to do. (P2 l :08) 
</p>
<p>As described by the majority of interviewees, coordination is executed in a top 
down approach. The example below derives from a high ranking employee who 
is responsible for the strategy and development of a project: 
</p>
<p>Well, I have another responsibility now in a coordinators role, called 
human security. [ ... ] on one hand, I develop strategies, strategies for 
the house, what does UNIDO do in this area, which services do we of-
fer, what impact do our programmes have and on the other hand it is 
project development. And here we work together with technical de-
partments and this means teamwork. Teamwork on another level; 
meaning that we develop a project together. (29:08)

<p>56 
</p>
<p>Step 2: What is missing according to individuals? 
</p>
<p>When I asked interviewees 'How do you define team or group work?' they be-
came aware of the difference between the two concepts. However, despite this 
awareness, the terms team and group are words that were used very loosely: the 
majority of interviewees predominately used the term team, a considerable 
number mainly referred to the term group but most of the time interviewees used 
the terms interchangeably in the course of their narratives. Even when explain-
ing the concepts it became clear that the simple use of terms does not mean that 
the concept beyond it corresponds to the terminology used. Individual work does 
not become group work simply because it is called so nor does group work be-
come team work for the very same reason (Katzenbach &amp; Smith, 1993). 
At the same time, some interviewees realised that - according to their very own 
definitions of team and group work - some major characteristics might be miss-
ing in their current work situation to make it a team. 
One of these elements reported by interviewees is performance measurement. 
Around 25 % of interviewees reported either a lack of performance measures or 
the wrong means of measurement: 
</p>
<p>They [management] should look at what they [group/team] achieved 
and set indicators to measure their performance. (Pl8:12) 
</p>
<p>There are performance indicators for projects but they have relatively 
little implications. (Pl 9:93) 
</p>
<p>Of course there are performance evaluation reports for the individual. 
One can say that one has developed this and that but that does not say 
anything about the success of the project whatsoever. This is defi-
nitely missing. (P29:35) 
</p>
<p>Around 10 % reported a lack of participation in the decision making process: 
</p>
<p>They (the supervisors) say that we can participate in the decision mak-
ing process but in the end only for non-essential issues. (P40:20) 
</p>
<p>Another 10 % of interviewees remarked that the overall structure of the United 
Nations Organisation is based on a hierarchical model and therefore does not 
allow team work. 
Consequently, a summary of the first two steps of data analysis on how indi-
viduals construe team and group work delivers the following insights. Narratives 
on team and group work are in 45 out of 50 interviews associated with organisa-

<p>57 
</p>
<p>tional characteristics such as hierarchy and bureaucracy. The work situation is 
described by referring to the organisational context which comprises a diverse 
workforce with diverse national and cultural origin. Almost 90 % of interview-
ees explain team and group work by relating it to hierarchical positions and 
functions of individuals in those positions. 
Despite the fact that interviewees were not provided with a definition for the 
terms 'team' and 'group' work but rather had to try to define the constructs 
themselves, more than half of all interviewees acknowledged that some elements 
which may characterise real team and group work might be missing in their 
daily work lives. 
</p>
<p>Step 3: Comparison with theoretical constructs of team and group work in aca-
demic literature 
</p>
<p>In the next step of analysis I compared the explanations of the interviewees with 
regard to team and group work with theoretical concepts in academic literature. 
This step comprised a comparison of definitions of the terms 'team' and 'group' 
to determine which type of work- group and/or team work - exists in the United 
Nations Organisations under investigation. 
A clear definition for the underlying concepts needed to be provided, hence, the 
simple but comprehensive definition by Katzenbach &amp; Smith ( 1993) seemed 
appropriate for this research setting. 
Definition of the term "team": 
A team is a number of 2 or more people who are committed to a common goal 
which is specific and different from each team member's individual goals. Team 
members work collectively to reach this goal. They share leadership roles and 
follow a collective decision making process. Furthermore, the solution to prob-
lems is found in the course of collective discussion. The outcomes of the team 
work are subject to collective performance measurement. 
Definition of the term "group": 
A group is a number of 2 or more people who are committed to a common goal 
which is similar to the broader organisational goals and each group member's 
individual goal. Group members work individually to reach their goals. The 
leadership role is centralised at one person who is also responsible for the deci-
sion making process and who delegates individual tasks. Finally, the outcome of 
group work is subject to individual performance measurement.

</p>
<p>This clear distinction between the terms team and group allowed for a typology 
of what kind of team and group work exists in the United Nations Organisations 
under investigation. 
</p>
<p>A comparison of the interview data with the requirements for team and group 
work showed that the individuals' work environment is strongly influenced by 
hierarchy and bureaucracy. As a result, highly ranked staff within the hierarchy 
is in a position of power, makes decisions and delegates tasks. Task specialisa-
tion permits individual performance measurement. Thus, formal requirements 
for team work are not met. The data however refer to the existence of group 
work. 
Based on the different definitions and underlying explanations of interviewees, 
three typologies of group work could be established and are grounded in the 
data. In the following, task forces, project groups, and collaboration and their 
categorisation into a typology of group work will be explained in some detail 
and illustrated by sample quotes. 
</p>
<p>Task forces 
</p>
<p>When the organisation needs something special to be done, it creates a small 
group to do it. This small group is brought together temporarily for a specific 
purpose and exists only until the problem is solved. Management literature calls 
these task forces 'temporary groups comprising people with complementary

</p>
<p>skills who work to a common purpose for which they are collectively account-
able' (Child, 2005, p.102). 
Task forces are flexible. They can focus on whatever problem of immediate im-
portance. They often bring together people from different sections or divisions 
of the organisation to work on a cross-functional purpose. In this way, task 
forces use information and knowledge from several sources which may induce 
new ideas and generate new directions. Rules and regulations may sometimes be 
simplified for task forces. There is a dedicated leader of the task force. Decision 
making is based on hierarchical position. All of these characteristics are 
grounded in the interview data and illustrated by sample quotes. Task forces are 
explained to be set up for two specific purposes: non-routine purposes and 
emergency events. 
</p>
<p>Interview 31: Task force for non-routine purposes 
</p>
<p>There were ad hoc groups, hundreds of them. These ad hoc teams 
could be found in the whole UN. High ranking officials were respon-
sible for the important issues. They gathered for non-routine-purposes 
which - in my view - were much more interesting. (P31 :26-28) 
</p>
<p>There were also special teams for annual meetings. The special advi-
sor had a supporting team as there was tremendous administrative 
work which had to be done under extreme time pressure while certain 
formal standards had to be maintained. A well functioning team was 
therefore very important. (P3 l :38) 
</p>
<p>Interview 42: Task forces for emergency events 
</p>
<p>It works like this: there is a catastrophe. Let's take the Tsunami as an 
example. We then needed many people, 50 or so, and once again, we 
break it down to 5 people, 5 people are a team which works some-
where in coordination. [ ... ] and then we select the team here. Our of-
fice is responsible for this and one of us here [ ... ] leads this team most 
of the time. We - senior people - lead the teams. (P42:24) 
</p>
<p>Our administration just called. They work for us in a simplified way 
[ ... ] we do not have to go through the same administrative system like 
the other agencies. This is emergency response and all our deadlines 
and rules for recruiting and sending off people into the field and appli-
cations for money are shortened. [ ... ] recruitment can be done within 
48 hours. (P42:48)

<p>60 
</p>
<p>Project groups 
</p>
<p>A project group according to the interviewees is established for the duration of a 
specific project. There are certain rules how to apply for a project, how to de-
velop project work plans, and about the duration of projects. Furthermore, re-
ports about the progress of the project have to be delivered on a regular basis. 
Once the project is completed, group members are reassigned to new projects or 
their contract is determined. If the goal could not be reached the project may be 
extended. These project groups have a designated project leader. Tasks are dis-
tributed according to specialisation. 
Project groups are reported to be found in technical units like the IAEA as well 
as in UNDP. The following quotes illustrate the findings: 
</p>
<p>Interview 20: Project group in IAEA 
</p>
<p>The application for the current project idea started in Sep. 2005. We 
are currently evaluating the applications, and at the end of 2006 we 
will visit the country and prepare a detailed plan of work for the next 2 
years. The project will start in 2007 and run for 2 years. After 2 years 
you decide to extend the project or not. It depends on whether they 
reached their goals or not. But there will be reports every 6 months to 
see how the project is going. (P20: 19) 
</p>
<p>For example we need to talk to farmers. I don't actually do it myself, 
the scientists there are responsible for it. But we bring a certain tech-
nology there and hope that it is successful. (P20: 11) 
</p>
<p>I work with 5 technical officers in a group and in collaboration with 
another officer. (P20: 15) 
</p>
<p>Interview 13: Project groups in UNDP 
</p>
<p>The work in small groups is running. There are 120 persons and they 
work in groups of 5 to IO persons, there are project manager, decision 
makers and supporting staff, another 5 persons who do the paperwork 
etc. Every 6 weeks there is a huge meeting which is more like an in-
formative management meeting. (P13:77)

</p>
<p>Collaboration 
</p>
<p>Wagner ( 1995) defined collaboration as a 'wilful contribution of personal effort 
to the completion of interdependent jobs'. 
This form of work was reported by interviewees within all five Organisations 
under investigation. Typically, this form of collaboration involves communica-
tion and exchange of information among individuals. However, there is not nec-
essarily a common goal collaborating individuals work for. Their collaboration 
might be a result of work in the same division or under the same manager. 
</p>
<p>Interview 4: Collaboration and Management 
Everyone is involved, everyone has to describe his/her job. XY is the 
quality manager who supervises everything. (P4:45) 
</p>
<p>Interview 23: Collaboration and Co-Workers 
</p>
<p>For technical requests an Austrian technician is responsible, he is my 
contact person and I work very closely with him. (P23:04) 
</p>
<p>Interview 38: Collaboration and task 
</p>
<p>It is repetitive, a lot of routine, the process and the workflow is very 
well defined. (P3 8: 16) 
</p>
<p>The typology presented shows that the extent to which group work takes place 
strongly depends on two factors: the timeframe and the degree of task specialisa-
tion. Task forces operate on non-routine tasks and are set up at an ad-hoc basis 
for a short period of time. Project groups work on well defined tasks for a longer 
period of time. Collaboration implies high task specialisation and unlimited 
time frame.

<p>In a follow up conversation with five selected interviewees from different hier-
archical positions and organisations I presented the typology of groups that 
evolved from the first part of data analysis. This feedback loop was very impor-
tant to make sure that the narratives of interviewees and my interpretations of 
them do not digress. The typology was approved by the control group of inter-
viewees. After interviewees were provided with a clear definition for the term 
team and the term group as shown in table 2, all of the five interviewees ac-
knowledged the difference between the two concepts. Moreover they agreed that 
team work by this definition does not exist in the five United Nations Organisa-
tions under investigation due to structural restrictions of the overall organisation, 
which will be explained in the next part of analysis. Table 3 illustrates the typol-
ogy of group work which emerged in the course of data analysis and by relating 
the data back to theory. The table gives an overview of all findings:

<p>4.3. Properties of group work 
The first major step of data analysis revealed that group work summarised in 
three broad typologies is practised in the five United Nations Organisations un-
der investigation. In a further step the properties of group work will be explored. 
All properties are derived from the interview data. Some of them emerged in the 
first step of analysis towards a typology; others emerged in the course of itera-
tion and constant comparison. 
The properties can be grouped around three main categories which emerged in 
the course of analysis, the first being the organisational level of the overall 
United Nations System comprising the Organisation's structure and processes. 
Second, the group level incorporates employee-management relationships and 
employee-co-worker relationships, and third, the individual level comprising 
personal attributes of individual employees represents another property of group 
work. Moreover, boundary spanning activities were identified to act as a mod-
erator. 
Figure 4 shows the process of how the categories emerged and led to generate a 
conceptual model. Each category which represents a property of group work will 
be explained in more detail in the remainder of this chapter which will conclude 
with the presentation of the conceptual model. Propositions will be deduced 
from the empirical analysis and formulated at the end of this chapter.

<p>4.3.1. Organisation 
4.3.1.1. Structure of the organisation 
</p>
<p>Like all organisations, the United Nations Organisations have a structure, lines 
of authority, formal communications, formal policies and formal rules 
(Beigbeder, 1987). In other words, the structure of the organisation is deter-
mined by hierarchy and bureaucracy. 
According to Child (2005), hierarchy, as part of the structure of an organisation, 
is depicted by different positions of power within the hierarchy and adjunctive 
authority as well as reporting lines. The specialisation of tasks takes place ac-
cording to functions like units, groups and roles. Furthermore, the structure of an 
organisation contains procedures to clarify to staff what is expected from them. 
This is translated into rules and standards (bureaucracy). 
</p>
<p>4.3.1. 1. I.Hierarchy 
</p>
<p>Hierarchy is a fact of both human and organisational life. The bigger an organi-
sation the more hierarchically structured it usually becomes. This way, organisa-
tional members can distinguish between different levels of responsibility, au-
thority and power. It also identifies accountability. 
In a conventional organisation, hierarchy is characterised as follows (adapted 
from Child (2005, p.61): 
</p>
<p>&bull; Positions are structured into clearly differentiated levels 
&bull; People at higher levels have greater authority and responsibility and take 
</p>
<p>decisions that are riskier and more complex 
&bull; People at a higher level have the authority to give instructions or request 
</p>
<p>to those lower and are ultimately responsible for the people at lower levels 
&bull; People at lower levels have the right to ask for guidance or instructions 
</p>
<p>from the ones above them 
&bull; Leadership is exercised top down through command, coordination and 
</p>
<p>control 
&bull; People at the higher level receive information before it is passed down to 
</p>
<p>the lower level 
</p>
<p>A purposeful way to explain the hierarchy of the United Nations Organisation is 
by using the United Nations Systems' salary structure which mirrors the hierar-
chical structure of the entire organisation. 
The United Nations salary system comprises 15 ranges of salary. The number of 
ranges is dependent on the number of hierarchical levels in the Organisation. 
The skills which are required for a job, the responsibilities of the employee, the 
supervisor or subordinate status of staff are determined by the level they occupy 
in the structure.

</p>
<p>The majority of the affiliated Organisations of the United Nations System are 
divided into 15 ranges. Only recently, select Organisations were consolidated 
into four main ranges or so called bands (Fernandez, 2005) as shown in the fig-
ure below:

<p>Band 4 staff(or D-staff) is divided into two Director Levels (Dl and D2) as well 
as the levels of Assistant Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General in 
some organisations and Assistant Director-General and Deputy Director-General 
in others. D-staff represents the highest level of staff within the hierarchy. Job 
duties involve, for example, strategic and / or political responsibilities. Band 3 
staff (P-staff) or professional staff comprises three grades: P3, P4, P5 whereas 
band 4 comprises two grades, namely Pl and P2 (includes also JPO, Junior Pro-

</p>
<p>fessional Officer). These middle and junior management positions involve man-
agement activities and are quite frequently based on contracts with a specific 
date of expiry and therefore have to be renewed from term to term. Thus, the 
principle of rotation applies to all of the bands described so far. Furthermore, 
staff on the professional and director level usually are recruited internationally 
and are paid on the basis of salary scales which were established by the General 
Assembly and apply worldwide. 
Finally, band 4 (G-staft) in the General Service comprises seven levels from G l 
to G7. General Service staff is recruited locally and broadly speaking is respon-
sible for administrative tasks. G-staff traditionally holds permanent contracts 
which are not subject to renewal. Overall, each band is connected to specific 
tasks, responsibilities and job related specialties such as the rotation principle. 
</p>
<p>Both the traditional as well as the broadbanded structure show that there is a 
strong hierarchy within the United Nations Organisations System. The existence 
of a strong hierarchy is also emphasised by the individual perceptions of 90% of 
all interviewees: 
</p>
<p>[ ... ] what strongly characterises the UN is that there are strong hierar-
chies. Well, it is all ... work is in line. Yes. The hierarchies are very 
strong. (P30: 12) 
</p>
<p>The hierarchy is very strict, I personally find that this is not beneficial 
for the outcome .. .let's put it this way. That does not mean that I really 
want to complain about it but it is a fact that it is very hierarchical 
here ... yes, there is a section head, from an actual head to director gen-
eral and back ... so it is all very hierarchical. (P39:39) 
</p>
<p>A point which might need to be considered which is negative is this 
strong hierarchical system ... that everything works according to fixed 
rules .. .it is very narrow and one does not have a lot of freedom, al-
most any step is given somewhere and has to be respected ... but 
whether this is good or bad is not up for discussion. (P2:22) 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.1.2. Bureaucracy 
As touched upon briefly above, hierarchy often arises hand in hand with bu-
reaucracy expressed by rules and regulations. The idea of bureaucracy is gener-
ally traced to Woodrow Wilson's (Wilson, 1887) influential article 'The study of 
administration' and Max Weber's work (Weber, 1922, 1962, 1978). To Weber, 
bureaucracy was a system of administration carried out on a continuous basis by 
trained professionals according to prescribed rules (Beetham, 1996).

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>68 
</p>
<p>The key features of the ideal type of bureaucracy according to Weber are 
(Allison, 1984): 
</p>
<p>1. Official functions organised on a continuous basis and regulated through a 
system of rules and procedures 
</p>
<p>2. A division of labour so that each function has its specific sphere of com-
petence 
</p>
<p>3. A hierarchical structure providing for the supervision of lower offices by 
higher ones 
</p>
<p>4. Technical rules and norms - their application requires that officials have 
received appropriate training, thus possess technical qualifications 
</p>
<p>5. A separation of the property of the organisation from that belonging to the 
official as a private individual 
</p>
<p>6. A written record of all administrative acts, decisions and rules 
</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is a means to describe relationships between organisational mem-
bers in two ways: on the one hand as a relationship of power and on the other 
hand as a relationship of care (Sewell &amp; Barker, 2006). When bureaucracy 
works through the operations of hierarchy and rule based conduct, it forms a re-
lationship of power. Consequently, bureaucracy can be seen as an instrument of 
power and control dominated by the top level of a hierarchy. 
Complementary to this, bureaucracy may also be seen as a means to protect the 
organisation and its individuals from adverse actions of managers or co-workers. 
This ambiguity is also reflected in the interview data: 
</p>
<p>... in the UN many bureaucratic steps are undertaken because we need 
to control each other... [ ... ] the bureaucracy in the UN is based on 
mutual distrust, which, yes, this is sometimes important to say because 
control is sometimes better than trust. (Pl3:39) 
</p>
<p>Well there are many many things one needs to know and which might 
be considered as bureaucracy in the broadest sense. But I think that 
this is indispensable. If an organisation is a certain size, this organisa-
tion needs a framework, a structure, which can be controlled and 
which people can work within. Unfortunately it does not work other-
wise. (P29:48) 
</p>
<p>The bureaucracy of the United Nations System is a rather old bureaucracy in 
comparison with other intergovernmental organisations like, for example, the 
European Union. Thus, the United Nations System has experienced a lot of re-

<p>fonns since the foundation of the system in 1945. These refonns where due to 
the dramatic operational expansion of the United Nations Systems throughout 
the years (Annan, 2006). 
In the course of refonns, several internal reports have repeatedly reported one 
major structural problem of the United Nations System as expressed in the fol-
lowing: 
</p>
<p>&bull; UN rules and regulations are too complicated and too numerous to serve 
as clear guidance for staff (Beigbeder, 1997) 
</p>
<p>Despite numerous attempts to refonn the bureaucratic system, complexity is still 
a fact of organisational life (90 % of interviews). 
One interviewee argued that because of the long existence of the bureaucracy 
and the various changes due to refonns and changing general directors, the 
overall bureaucracy became even more complex throughout the years: 
</p>
<p>The UN bureaucracy has no logic. It has grown but the ones who 
make the bureaucracy only stay for 2 years and their successors do not 
look at what the people previously have done and so it all becomes 
quite illogical. (Pl3:81) 
</p>
<p>Or as stated by another interviewee: 
</p>
<p>It (the bureaucracy) is terrible! Each general director promises to re-
duce it but this never happens .. .it is absurd, there is practically no 
control in the web and you need I 000 signatures for even the smallest 
things. (P23: 14) 
</p>
<p>Another staff member who worked for the United Nations 20 years ago, left to 
become self-employed and has returned to work on a 3-year contract remarked 
the following: 
</p>
<p>Well I have the feeling that it all slowed down. Purchasing for exam-
ple used to be much faster in the past, now one needs much more time. 
Recently it has taken 4 month to order equipment. (P24: 16) 
</p>
<p>There are too many subdivisions. Each huge organisation structures a 
lot, too much, the processes become very long. (P24:16) 
</p>
<p>In general, the interviewed staff perceived bureaucracy to be extremely strong 
and especially hard to learn when beginning to work at the United Nations Or-

</p>
<p>ganisation. This point has been emphasised by the majority of interviewees who 
also mentioned the need to rely on the help of others to get acquainted with bu-
reaucracy: 
</p>
<p>Oh, it is a disaster. The processes and protocols are amazing. It takes 
400 times longer than learning the alphabet. But you know, they have 
to be accountable and there are so many projects that's why they need 
all the protocols. So basically, I think it is all because of accountabil-
ity. But the processes themselves are not clear. I am glad I have peo-
ple I can ask. (P22: 12) 
</p>
<p>Another interviewee described a feeling of being lost in bureaucracy by refer-
ring to being an apprentice who has to learn from scratch: 
</p>
<p>I have the feeling, well, I feel like an apprentice again. (P4 l :92) 
</p>
<p>The feeling of being lost in rules and regulations was also shared by another in-
terviewee who has spent several years in the United Nations. The interviewee 
distinguishes between 'official rules and regulations' and 'personal rules' set up 
by individuals and not by the system. As touched upon earlier, the bureaucracy 
of the United Nations is a rather old one and has repeatedly changed, but also 
seems that it has been gradually built up over the years. These procedures are 
outlined in the following quote which helps to give a feeling for what awkward 
really means: 
</p>
<p>Up to now I still don't know how and why things work and others 
don't. There are different levels. On one hand there are relatively 
many rules, general rules and specific UNOPS rules which demand a 
lot of bureaucratic processes. And then there is the next level [ ... ] I'd 
like to give an example: there are UN rules which state how to do the 
purchasing. If we have finally signed a contract, then, according to the 
rules, the producer has to send the original invoice. Why the original 
invoice ... this originates from the old times ... supposing there was 
just one invoice which could guarantee that a) the invoice is correct 
and b) it is not paid twice. We still carry along the processes of the 
old system; we say that we need an original invoice. Well, we receive 
the original invoice; the project manager receives it, that's only a per-
sonal thing that does not have anything to do with rules. The project 
manager copies the invoice and passes it on to his payment assistant; 
the payment assistant copies it for personal records and passes it on 
the finance. Finance holds the original. This means that paper load is

<p>71 
</p>
<p>tripled but this is not a rule, it simply is like that because one day 
someone started doing it like this. If there is no original invoice be-
cause it came by fax it has to be approved by the division chief which 
does not make sense at all because a division has around 700 projects. 
And to know of 700 projects which one is an original invoice and has 
someone twiddled something does not make sense. [ ... ] Anyhow, the 
invoice has to be signed and makes its way through many hierarchical 
levels. It takes a long time until it finally gets paid. Our task with this 
business process reengineering is to find out where do rules apply and 
where do we find processes which have developed over the years and 
became a habit. (P44:75) 
</p>
<p>However, the remarks about bureaucracy by the various interviewees should 
also be put into perspective. It is a kind of stereotype that public or intergovern-
mental organisations have particularly high levels of rules and red tape, hence 
bureaucracy. A number of studies have compared structural characteristics of 
private companies and public or intergovernmental organisations (Rainey &amp; 
Bozeman, 2000). Opposing the existing stereotype, these studies did not report 
significantly different levels of red tape (Bozemann &amp; Loveless, 1987). This 
view was also shared by a few interviewees who have had working experience 
outside of the United Nations System: 
</p>
<p>... to be honest, in huge companies like Bertelsman or IBM or others it 
was the same, it has to be like that. You need the different checks and 
balances. (PI 6: 13) 
</p>
<p>If something becomes big, all huge organisations tend to document 
everything, to streamline it and then you have all these procedures 
which one has to respect. Everything that becomes big becomes rela-
tively inflexible, on the other hand it becomes manageable because of 
the process ... (P9:44) 
</p>
<p>Hmm ... the bigger the company the more bureaucratic it becomes. It 
was the same when I worked at Ericsson, people had enough to do 
without producing any output. They were so occupied internally that 
no one would notice that there is no output. (P2:93) 
</p>
<p>Regardless of whether differences or similarities were highlighted throughout 
various studies, it was found that any activity related to personnel administration 
typically faced much more red tape in government organisations (Bozemann, 
</p>

</p>
<p>2000). This topic will be investigated in more detail in the following section as it 
was a significant factor in the interview data. 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.2. Human resource management 
</p>
<p>A general objective of Human Resource Management is to find staff who match 
the abilities and attitudes desired by the organisation to provide just compensa-
tion and benefits and to guarantee continuous career management (Fernandez, 
2005). 
Being an international, intergovernmental organisation with 191 member states 
challenges the Human Resource Management of the United Nations System as 
each member state shall be represented proportionally in the various United Na-
tions Organisations and gender equality shall be provided (UN, Charter). The 
subsequent implications are structured in the following into topics such as re-
cruiting, contracts, career development and termination of contracts. 
</p>
<p>Recruiting 
The United Nations System has strict recruitment policies to ensure transpar-
ency, equality and fairness. These policies are reflected in very detailed job de-
scriptions. Furthermore, the venue and length of advertisements is clearly speci-
fied and the selection of personnel is subject to strict rules. Overall, the recruit-
ment procedures are indeed complex and lengthy. On average it takes 174 days 
from the time a vacancy is announced to the time the candidate is selected 
(Annan, 2006). 
This was also pointed out by two interviewees: 
</p>
<p>It can take months until one gets an answer. I applied for a job in May 
and it was September when I was informed that I would have an inter-
view. (P21 :28) 
</p>
<p>HR is very slow, everything has to work according to specific 
rules ... but I think this does not depend on the people but on the proc-
esses. (21 :32) 
</p>
<p>A speciality of the recruiting system is that the United Nations Organisations 
generally look to promote existing staff before recruiting from the outside by, 
for example, reassigning staff from headquarters to perform various field jobs 
and project related work (Fernandez, 2005). This is possible because of the di-
verse workforce that exists within the whole United Nations System which is 
one of the advantages of intergovernmental organisations. One interviewee high-

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>73 
</p>
<p>lighted the advantages of this recruitment process and described the internal ap-
plication process as well as the possibilities to climb the hierarchy as follows: 
</p>
<p>There is a tender which means that all posts are part of the tender. If I 
find an interesting job on our website I can apply for it, then I might 
be invited to an interview and maybe I get the job. This means I can 
always apply for something else. For example, my job is a G-4 posi-
tion. If I have 5,6,7 years of work experience, that's most of the time 
the minimum, and maybe my section head retires, then I will apply for 
his job, which is a G-5 job. (P9:76) 
</p>
<p>However, one of the downsides of staffing in intergovernmental organisations 
results from political appointments. According to two interviewees: 
</p>
<p>This is a political organisation. So there are 191 member states, they 
are governments; they are not people, so they have their own interests. 
[ ... ]. But then sometimes you know, member states lobby certain 
posts, high level posts, it is all a fact of life. So you have to take that 
into account. It is not only about performance. But that's a fact of life 
in the UN. (P47:122) 
</p>
<p>Sure, the environment is very political here. But somehow it is just 
like in the public authorities ... with a new government comes a new 
minister. .. (P39:70) 
</p>
<p>Different contracts 
Another downside of the United Nations Human Resource Management is evi-
dent in the plethora of different types of contractual arrangements. On the one 
hand, they are difficult to administer as the contracts range from permanent to 
monthly contracts with enormous variations between and among contracts. On 
the other hand they create inequality and resentment between staff as it is a fact 
of life that staff work side by side in similar positions but receive different fi-
nancial remunerations and services. 
An interviewee makes the point: 
</p>
<p>When it comes to contracts there is extreme variety. There are people 
who handle themselves from one 3-month-contract to another and 
there are people who hold permanent contracts, quasi for the rest of 
their lives. And in between there are various nuances with regards to 
the length of a contract. There are people who do similar jobs but have 
very different contracts. (P44:39)

</p>
<p>Yet another issue which arises as a result of differing lengths of contracts is re-
flected in the rotation of higher ranking staff which is due to rotation policy. The 
latter involves rotation of usually higher level staff between positions and loca-
tions on a regular basis (between 1-3 years). Interviewees explain that this rota-
tion policy triggers constantly changing procedures: 
</p>
<p>I see a problem in the enormously strong change. The frequency is 
very likely one and a half years for international staff. Very often in-
ternational staff is the high ranking staff which makes the decisions. 
And that's where I see the big problem ... because of a lot of rotation 
and changes in decisions. It's just like if you work in an Austrian 
company and the persons who make decisions change every year, and 
then there are also problems. (Pl3:48) 
</p>
<p>The rotation policy is seen twofold: on the one hand a regular change of high 
ranking staff leads to consistently changing decisions and practices and hinders 
stability while on the other hand it seems to be indispensable when it comes to 
political issues. Furthermore, rotation does not only have negative aspects but 
also positive ones if, for example, it ensures continuous learning and progress. 
One interviewee highlighted the differences between the need for stability and 
the need for progress: 
</p>
<p>P-Staff have this rotation policy so they are in a continuous war be-
cause people want to keep their job. The personal interest is first prior-
ity. This is a problem but at the same time the rotation policy is neces-
sary for 2 reasons 
There should not be the same people all the time. New blood/new 
ideas bring evolution. You need to be always at the top of the technol-
ogy and therefore you need new people with new ideas and that's why 
it is fair. [ ... ]And they should choose people on real competency. But 
of course there is political pressure from member states; they want to 
have their people in place. It is difficult to have a really competent 
base and a political system. (P 18:09) 
</p>
<p>This struggle is also reflected in the following quote: 
</p>
<p>The big problem of the UN is the fluctuation that people leave because 
of the rotation policy. At the same time the system stabilises other and 
carries them along even though you would not need them any more.

</p>
<p>Career development 
The types of contract individuals hold directly influence their possibilities for 
career development. Furthermore, career development is obviously limited by 
education, skills and hierarchical position. Like in any other organisation, pro-
motions may only be granted if the employee possesses the necessary qualifica-
tions. However, in the United Nations there are two more dimensions which in-
fluence career development: geographical origin and the existence of plan posi-
tions within the hierarchy. The staff interviewed perceive the issue of geo-
graphical posts as follows: 
</p>
<p>Permanent staff at the UN that's geographical posts, you really need to 
come from an underrepresented country and you need to fulfill so 
many requirements to receive the job, it is not really your knowledde. 
(P43:44) 
</p>
<p>Some positions aren't an option if you are the wrong nationality. But 
you have to live with it, it is the same in politics. (P29:64) 
</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, staff have a very realistic view of personal possi-
bilities within the career path based on education and skills and the existence of 
plan positions: 
</p>
<p>A promotion, to get the job of my supervisor, is practically impossible 
because ofmy education and the fact that I am Austrian. I won't make 
the next step. That's not possible because for the job you need to be 
academic ... only if you are the only qualified candidate then you get 
the P-post even though you are Austrian and under qualified. (P8:65) 
</p>
<p>I have limited career possibilities. Let's put it this way ... they are lim-
ited because a lot of planned posts have been cut. If there are no 
planned posts I can do five times the job of someone else who has a 
higher ranked post. If there are no posts there are no posts. And that's 
the disadvantage of international organisations because if you work in 
an international company you boss can promote you more easily. 
That's not possible here. (P9:62). 
</p>
<p>However, some staff feel disadvantaged in the promotion process and point this 
back to the management: 
</p>
<p>The management often does not place staff in suitable positions. Peo-
ple are not asked, suddenly there is a new org chart and some people

<p>76 
</p>
<p>are shifted. One the other hand some people do not get shifted at all. 
(P27:33) 
</p>
<p>Termination of contracts 
The termination of contracts, especially permanent contracts, is extremely diffi-
cult and tedious. At the same time contracts of politically appointed staff can 
hardly be terminated because of their political nature. As a consequence, people 
stay within the United Nations even though their performance is unsatisfactory. 
The following comments best capture these insights: 
</p>
<p>You have to something really bad to be dismissed. It happens but very 
rarely. (P24:24) 
</p>
<p>That's an absolutely huge problem. I don't think it is possible to fire 
people unless you do something really really horrible and it ends up in 
the newspaper. It's very difficult to get fired in the UN. (P47: 110) 
</p>
<p>In the end these people are put into unimportant positions and are car-
ried along by the system. (Pl3:75) 
</p>
<p>The issues covered above have been raised in different internal reports of the 
United Nations over and over again during the course of the past decades. As a 
result, several reforms have been introduced to solve these problems. One of 
these reforms introduced in 2002 aimed at promoting staff on merit and compe-
tence and less on tenure and precedent (Fernandez, 2005). The outcome, accord-
ing to Fernandez (2005), has been a streamlining of procedures which reduced 
the selection and recruitment process to 90 days. 
</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to refer back to the beginning of this chapter where I 
described the strong hierarchy of the United Nations Organisation with its strict 
categorisation of staff into different bands. As already explained and illustrated 
by quotes, this hierarchy restricts the individuals' possibilities for skill develop-
ment because certain training is only available for certain types of staff. More-
over, it limits career development as promotions are still based on seniority and 
time in the position and not on performance or merit. This is also true for the 
remuneration of staff as the current pay system is not sensitive to performance 
but solely based on position within the hierarchy. This system triggers implica-
tions on motivation, competition, knowledge sharing and individual behaviour, 
which will be discussed in the following section.

<p>4.3.1.3. Moderator: Boundary crossing and boundary spanning 
Another component of an organisation, according to Child (2005), is the bound-
ary-crossing component which is traditionally concerned with drawing lines of 
exclusion between units and jobs by a clear specification of responsibilities and 
authority. It also involves networking as an alternative to hierarchies depicted by 
communication across an organisation's boundaries. The latter is also known as 
boundary spanning. Generally speaking, boundary activities as described by 
Cross, Yan &amp; Louis (2000, p. 843) are those 'in which an organisational entity 
engages to create and maintain its boundaries and to manage interactions across 
those boundaries'. This organisational entity may be an organisational unit, a 
group or team or an individual. 
Boundary spanning in literature is closely linked to bureaucracy and hierarchy 
and aims to reduce the amount of red tape as well as the number of levels in the 
hierarchy. One way to achieve this might be by implementing cross-functional 
or team-based structures (Denison, 1996). 
On an individual level, boundary spanning may be related to networking, com-
munication and exchange of information. Individual boundary spanning arises if 
communication across organisational boundaries is inefficient, time consuming 
or too costly (Katz &amp; Kahn, 1966). 
In the following I will first explain the triggers for boundary spanning in this 
specific context. Furthermore, I will illustrate individual boundary spanning ac-
tivities by quotes before concluding with boundary activities enacted by the or-
ganisation. 
</p>
<p>Triggers for boundary spanning 
Coming back to the initially cited report which depicted the problems of the 
United Nations System, the list established therein continues as follows 
(Beigbeder, 1997): 
</p>
<p>&bull; There is a lack of both horizontal and vertical communication 
&bull; Institutional memory needs improvement 
</p>
<p>These two points address the double-edge sword characteristics of hierarchy 
which have already been referred to in the previous section. Although hierar-
chies are said to be better mechanisms to transfer knowledge than, for example, 
markets (Kogut &amp; Zander, 1993), data analysis showed that this is not perceived 
in the five Organisations under investigation. On the one hand, hierarchy assures 
clear lines of report, responsibility and control. On the other hand, hierarchy re-
stricts managerial efforts, career and skill development. Consequently, hierarchy 
limits information exchange, alas communication, and as a result, it limits 
knowledge transfer. Consequently, institutional memory can hardly be built up.

</p>
<p>Knowledge as defined by Davenport &amp; Klahr (1998) is 'information combined 
with experience, context, interpretation and reflection'. Literature distinguishes 
between two types of knowledge: explicit and tacit knowledge. Explicit knowl-
edge can be coded and stored by writing it down while tacit knowledge is 
mainly in people's heads and more difficult to capture and to make explicit 
(Polanyi, 1967). 
This is reflected in the interview data as illustrated by the following quote: 
</p>
<p>It is much more bureaucratic than I had thought, much more hierarchical 
and each department cooks its own soup and the departments know rela-
tively little about what is going on in other departments. And what I notice 
is that this organization lacks knowledge management. It simply does not 
exist here. For example if you search a specific document you are lost here. 
And the processes duplicate, I think this is because the departments do not 
communicate with each other. There is also no knowledge pool, no infor-
mation pool to get information and knowledge from. (P4 l :37) 
</p>
<p>Another interviewee explains the lack of knowledge transfer to expectations re-
lated to different jobs, suggesting that in a certain position specific skills and 
specific knowledge are expected, and therefore there is little need to share or 
transfer knowledge: 
</p>
<p>We were the first ones in this office. It did not exist before. This 
means that everything was very confusing, there was nothing and I 
was expected to have the ability to manage this position and to work 
according to the terms of reference. Strickly speaking, one does not 
need training or knowledge transfer. 
</p>
<p>Interviewer: And your successor also did not receive any training? 
</p>
<p>No, I don't even think that I will get to know him/her. I know the ap-
plication process, it will take a long time until my successor will be 
here. I only have to finish my work so my successor does not have to 
work on it any more and I need to put all the data in templates on the 
PC. It will all be available on the computer and he/she will have to 
work with it. I only leave access codes and make a written handover.

<p>79 
</p>
<p>Another interviewee points to the lack of communication and information shar-
ing across organisational units: 
</p>
<p>What I have noticed is that there is rather competition than coopera-
tion between the UN agencies. there are tasks which partly overlap, 
each department names it differently but in reality it is the same task. 
However, they all need donors. So the donors can decide who has got 
the better proposal and that's the reason why the internal cooperation 
is not so strong. I for example was looking for a paper from UNDP 
and wanted to borrow it from the library. But they said that it is a pa-
per and that I have to pay for it. Well, there is competition especially 
when it comes to funding of projects. It is always about money and 
each signature is probably about money as well. (P12:48) 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, to continuously ensure accountability, hierarchy is supported by 
bureaucracy with its rules and regulations. Power is given to those who can 
change the rules and regulations (D and P staff) but also to others who know 
how to apply and execute these rules and regulations (G staff). 
As a result, exchange of information and communication becomes part of a 
game of power. In the worst case, knowledge is not shared. An interviewee 
makes the point: 
</p>
<p>G Staff is extremely important because it is not replaced. The people 
know why there are rules and how they work. Without G staff the or-
ganization would not work. G staff are a living memory, we leave af-
ter a couple of years but they stay. Motivated G-staff are extremely 
positive but at the moment when they become negative it becomes a 
hurdle per se. If they (G-staff) don't help you, you make one mistake 
after the other. (P24:33). 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.3.1. Individual boundary spanning 
To reduce their information deficit, and to work beyond hierarchical limitations, 
individuals start to span boundaries. Research has for example shown that exter-
nal contacts are used to obtain information, support or resources (Ancona &amp; 
Caldwell, 1988). Other research suggests that leaders can be the impetus for 
boundary spanning (Cross et al., 2000). 
Overall, there are many ways to span and cross boundaries and each individual 
might follow a different approach and a different strategy. Some start to com-
municate outside the hierarchical lines of communication, others start to net-
work and others build friendships and favour each other. The following quotes

</p>
<p>are examples of different ways of individual boundary crossing and spanning in 
the United Nations Organisations under investigation: 
</p>
<p>It sounds funny but I just walk around and ask all the people and 
somehow I get the information i need. I always try to find it some-
where but I have to say that it is hard to find info on the intranet which 
we now have [ ... ] I have realised that emails and telephone calls 
mostly are not so effective which means I just walk up onto the 5th 
floor and say I need this and that and then the people are always 
friendly and I get information provided they have the knowledge. 
(P4 l :41) 
In my case it is easy, I know the people, I know where to go and what 
to do. (P2 l :27) 
</p>
<p>I have a great uni network and many connections. For example, you 
need an import licence for a device from the US. Still the are not al-
lowed to send it to us so they send it to me at uni and we also have got 
it. If you want you can bypass anything. You can only make it through 
the networks the individuals have, the UN does not have it. The UN 
does not have the money to build up networks and resources that's 
why the UN takes on the right people. The UN buys P-staff to fulfil 
specific tasks. (P24:26) 
</p>
<p>There are key people who are the link from one team to another. The 
informal network is much stronger than the formal network. It is much 
stronger than the hierarchy. (P42:50) 
</p>
<p>There is a discrepancy between hierarchy and its formal usage. There 
is a parallel system. (P39:44) 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.3.2. Organisational boundary spanning 
In the organisational context of the United Nations System, the strongest indica-
tor of boundary activities is manifested in various organisational reform proc-
esses. The Secretary of the United Nations articulated in various reports that the 
organisational structure needs to be reformed and to address new needs and re-
quirements demanded of an organisation in the 21 st century. New governance 
principles, a strong management, and horizontal coordination over vertical hier-
archy are the primacies. 
Yan and Louis ( 1999) see the main organisational forces to span or even bring 
up boundaries in de-bureaucratisation, the use of teams, a shrink of organisa-

<p>tional slack, increased workforce diversity and advanced information technol-
ogy. 
The following quote illustrates activities in place in the United Nations System 
referring to de-bureaucratisation: 
</p>
<p>I have an internal project. .. business process reeingineering. We look 
at processes and how to make them faster, more effective and more 
accountable. Some processes need a lot of time and energy without 
showing any effect so we try to open up the process at some point to 
make it faster. In the UN a lot of paper is being moved and we try to 
cut it and to introduce more intelligent systems. The problem often is 
that there are papers with seven signatures. This takes a lot of time and 
energy without having any effect so we try to implement faster proce-
dures. (P44:43) 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.4. Culture of the organisation 
</p>
<p>A plethora of definitions of the culture of an organisation exist. In a most gen-
eral description, the term refers to shared meaning suggesting that the culture of 
an organisation is carried in the values and behavioural norms of organisational 
members. Moreover, culture is a process and a product of people within an or-
ganisation. 'People interacting in an organisation create their culture through 
their interactions with one another, culture is produced not for them but by 
them' (Gortner, Nichols, &amp; Ball, 2007, p.156) 
A longtime researcher of organisational culture, Edgar Schein (1984), has pro-
posed the following definition: 'Organisational culture is the pattern of basic 
assumptions that a given group has invented, discovered or developed in learn-
ing to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration, and 
that have worked well enough to be considered valid, and, therefore, to be taught 
to new members as the new way to perceive, think and feel in relation to those 
problems.' 
Despite definitions, organisational culture is a concept which is hard to capture 
and the question is how to assess culture. 
Research suggests that culture exists on several levels. Schein's influential 
model (Schein, 1985) suggests that that there are three levels of culture: the first 
level comprises observable manifestations of culture. These artefacts are for in-
stance symbols, the physical arrangement of work spaces or the pattern of com-
munications and how power is expressed. The second level comprises the values 
and behavioural norms which underlie these artefacts, and at the third level lay 
beliefs and assumptions. The latter ones are the core essence of culture accord-
ing to Schein.

<p>Invisible - the 
core of culture 
</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Hofstede (2001) for example summarises manifestations of 
culture in an onion diagram which comprises three layers, namely symbols, he-
roes, and rituals. At the core of the onion lie values. The three layers are visible 
to an outside observer while values are invisible and only become evident in be-
haviour. 
</p>
<p>This first level of organisational culture was represented in the interview data as 
quoted in the following: 
</p>
<p>The size of the office and the number of windows tell you quite a lot 
about the status of the person. (P39:79) 
</p>
<p>There is a difference between staff and delegates in this house ... there 
are two discussion-cultures. (P 1: 17)

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>83 
</p>
<p>Moreover, culture becomes visible in the jargon and terminology organisational 
members use. This aspect comes into it's own in the quotes of interviewees. All 
of them used at one stage of the interview expressions of a second language as a 
result of the mixed use of different working languages, especially English and 
German. Most of the time sentences were a mix of both languages as demon-
strated in the following sample which is a quote by an Austrian staff member. 
Out of the 36 words of this single, supposedly German sentence, 10 are English: 
</p>
<p>In fact this is true for all international employees and the WIPO is a 
specialized agency of the UN so we are all part of the UN family, we 
have the same staff regulations and rules and management principles. 
(P40:47) 
</p>
<p>Another indicator for organisational culture is that it provides an intrinsic sense 
of belonging for the individual. Instrumental theory (Jimenez, G6rinak, Kosic, 
Kiss, &amp; Kandulla, 2004) argues that identification and the feeling of belonging 
are induced by perceived personal interests. In the case of the United Nations 
this is reflected in the belief of individuals that their belonging to this organisa-
tion and their work has a sense of meaning and impact. This is also called the 
symbolic-interpretive approach to culture (Geertz, 1973). According to Weick 
(2001) making meaning is also an issue of organisational culture. As expressed 
by interviewees: 
</p>
<p>I do work with a feeling that I have greater influence. The projects ap-
ply for so many countries and it is great responsibility because it gives 
help to people all around the world. (P22:25) 
</p>
<p>On this international level one has the feeling of being able to exert in-
fluence. (Pl4:69) 
</p>
<p>The second level of organisational culture is composed of the deeply held val-
ues, beliefs, assumptions, and attitudes that underlie behaviour. This level of 
culture is not as visible as the previously described level of organisational cul-
ture. However, it can be made visible when looking at shared meanings of indi-
viduals who work in a specific organisation. Key characteristics of shared mean-
ing are amongst others communication patterns which influence the relationship 
between individuals and their managers as well as individuals and their co-
workers. Hence, individual values and beliefs can be unfolded by looking at dif-
ferent types of relationships. This level of culture will be explained in the fol-
lowing section which focuses on the relationship between employees and man-
agement and employees and co-workers, and the individual who is the agent in 
these relationships.

<p>4.3.2. Employee - Management relationship 
</p>
<p>4.3.2.1. Management - the crucial link 
The former General Secretary, Kofi Annan (2006), strongly emphasised in the 
millennium summit the improvement of Human Resource Management (HRM). 
The weakness of the HRM system specifically lies in the neglect of: 
</p>
<p>&bull; the build up and development of competent management; and 
&bull; the importance of participation of staff members to develop and maintain 
</p>
<p>their skills and competencies through constant learning and development. 
</p>
<p>Being aware of managerial problems within the system, Kofi Annan initiated in 
2005 a study which aimed at improving the quality of selection and training of 
heads of the United Nations funds and programmes. This study was carried out 
by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and an external consultant. The out-
come, presented in a multipart report in June 2006, is a comprehensive review of 
governance and oversight within the United Nations, funds, programmes and 
specialised agencies (OIOS, 2006). This report is especially interesting for this 
dissertation as it covers (amongst other units) all the units in which interviews 
for this research were conducted. Furthermore, one part of the data derives from 
160 interviews with managers and addresses several management issues which 
will be mentioned in the further analysis. 
The report highlighted the importance of a better training of managers which 
allows managers to reflect on their management style, to learn recent manage-
ment techniques as well as to apply them. These measures aim to develop future 
managers who possess the necessary leadership skills as well as cross cultural 
and team competences. 
Hence, increasing emphasis is put on the development of management as it is 
seen as the key driver to induce organisational cultural change, to build up 
shared organisational values and to promote effective performance management. 
An established UN competency model suggests that core organisational values 
and competencies may only be induced by competent management. The model 
contains three core values, eight core competencies, and six managerial compe-
tencies, the latter playing a dominant role in the model as shown in table 7 be-
low.

<p>The model seems to acknowledge the middle role of managers between the or-
ganisation and the employee. Managers must fulfil contradictory roles as subor-
dinates expect them to represent their interests upward to higher officials while 
higher officials expect them to present organisational goals downward to em-
ployees. 
To be able to fulfil these roles equally well, managers need to possess manage-
rial skills. Skills often referred to are a manager's ability to perform aspects of 
the job like handling interpersonal problems or handling the budgeting process. 
A group manager moreover needs to be able to handle group dynamics and has 
to know how to delegate and allocate tasks. Moreover, an important skill is to 
know how to empower and motivate others and how to build up trust. 
To develop leadership and managerial capacity and to enable managers to suc-
cessfully fulfil their role as a link between the organisation and the individual 
employee, the following trainings are offered: 
</p>
<p>&bull; Management Trainings are targeting D 1 and D2 staff and P-staff with su-
pervisory responsibilities and focus on the development of leadership 
competencies. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Department-based managerial Development focuses on providing specific 
trainings according to the needs of individual departments. The aim is to 
strengthen the skills of individual managers by taking into account the 
people and processes within a specific department. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Supervisory skills trainings focus on the development of staff at all hier-
archical levels who has supervisory responsibilities and it accompanied by 
a follow-up programme to reinforce the skills learned and to assess further 
needs.

</p>
<p>&bull; Team based workshops aim to promote team work by introducing the 
concept of team work. 
</p>
<p>&bull; lntercultural workshops are designed to raise awareness of the impact of 
diversity and aim to show how to work constructively with people from 
different backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>The plan for raising team awareness by team training was put into practice im-
mediately as at the time of the interview interviewees in management positions 
were already engaged with management training in various fonns: 
</p>
<p>There is an initiative which began in our HR department. Within the 
HR department there is section responsible for training and education 
and they have offered team building courses. These courses are of-
fered in my sector so we need to spare 2 days for teambuilding. This is 
nothing new for me, it is the third teambuilding course I have taken 
[laughter] or management course. [ ... ]the ones I took focused on psy-
chological aspects. I recall a course which started with half a day of 
analysis of my own personality profile according to Jung. 
[ ... ](P39: 17) 
</p>
<p>Yes, it will be a team building training. We did a process analysis then 
we have some recommendation of the management and there was a lot 
of communication and so on and so forth and now we are taking all 
the groups sector of the trademarks in team building exercise, a train-
ing, then we will complement that by a management training where 
XX will take part and where we discuss all the issues we got from the 
teambuilding training. (P38:24) 
</p>
<p>I know that the UN actually has training on multiculturalism or so for 
managers on how to manage team diversity, cultural diversity I think 
is what they call it. They have a - I think it is a one day training -
which you can take but only if you are manager. (P47:138) 
</p>
<p>Oh yes, there has been some intercultural training recently but only for 
section and unit heads. But we all should receive the training material 
or at least have access to it. (P8:38) 
</p>
<p>The last quote above highlights the fact that all of these trainings were made 
available to staff in leading and supervisory functions only. However, the need 
for diverse trainings not only applies to management but also to all other levels 
of staff. This implies that both management and subordinates need to develop 
skills. Therefore, a further aim of management training is to enable managers to

<p>87 
</p>
<p>pass on their knowledge to their subordinates and to encourage them to partici-
pate in various trainings themselves. 
One group leader described how skills learned in the course of training were 
passed on to subordinates: 
</p>
<p>Well, I have done some trainings with them .. .I tried to raise team 
spirit so that everyone knows that well .. .I need this person for that 
and in return this person needs me for something else. (P35:67) 
</p>
<p>Usually, management takes over staff development in the context of perform-
ance appraisal by assessing needs and wishes of individual employees. The fo-
cus of such appraisals lies on 
</p>
<p>&bull; explaining organisational needs and goals and how to reach them 
&bull; working on individual needs such as training and skill development 
&bull; assessing career opportunities 
</p>
<p>The quote of one employee below illustrates the agenda of individual appraisals: 
</p>
<p>There are personal reviews. Tasks for the next year are set and at the 
end of the year one has a look whether or not the task has been 
achieved. Also some sort of career plan is discussed which I find very 
good. (P2:56) 
</p>
<p>4.3.2.2. Criticism of management 
As in any other organisation, criticism of management is part of organisational 
life and was frequently expressed throughout the interviews. 
One major criticism dealt with the effect of political job positioning of manag-
ers. This topic has also been addressed by Kofi Annan (2006) who stressed the 
importance of more transparency and quality of selection of management across 
all levels of the organisation. He emphasised the fact that only a more rigorous 
selection process combined with a clear statement of responsibility and authority 
of individual managers will increase their accountability. Moreover, he proposed 
to establish clear criteria for assessing the performance of managers. 
In practice, however, empirical evidence shows that despite reform attempts, the 
general problem in hierarchical organisations (Gortner et al., 2007)is that a for-
mal position in the hierarchy does not prove anything about a person's manage-
ment abilities, still prevails. 
The following quotes summarise the criticism of management: 
</p>

</p>
<p>They recruit any managers, they are managers but they do not have 
real knowledge in the specific field. That's the actual problem. You 
get a manager who used to be responsible for, let's say, food and now 
he/she has to manage the print office. (P35:165) 
In my view too many managers are sitting in the wrong places but 
these organizations have no influence on it because top management is 
solely politically appointed, this is one of the shortcomings in these 
organizations. (P29:64) 
Ahm, the manager is most important and I think that's the problem 
because in the UN the managers are too political. There are all these 
principles like integrity, respect for diversity in recruitment but in the 
end it is more a political factor which is stronger and that's why in the 
end we have all those managers who are not good managers. (P43: 12) 
</p>
<p>When speaking about their own managers, interviewees predominantly criticised 
the lack of decision making competency of managers. Criticism not only alluded 
to the long and cumbersome process of decision making which is led by rules 
and regulations but also to the lack of decision making competency. 
The following quote criticises managers who did not make decisions and fur-
thermore lacked in communication: 
</p>
<p>In this particular office the management was really bad. Some argued 
this was due to the fact that both chief managers came from West Af-
rica. I would certainly not have said so but I am still convinced that 
they were extremely indecisive. They never made any decisions. Also, 
the communication did not work but I do not think this was due to the 
multinational environment, I think they were just happy to have this 
important position and they did not work on it any more. (P 13 :06) 
</p>
<p>Half of all interviewed persons concluded that managers are afraid to make deci-
sions and hold responsible for them because of a fear of losing their good job 
position: 
</p>
<p>They [the managers] can not make any decisions or they do not dare 
to and they do not take any responsibility. (Pl6:51) 
</p>
<p>However, interviewees also reported positively about their managers. Some de-
scribed good managers by referring to human qualities of the manager and by 
describing different skills which distinguish a so called 'good manager' from a 
'bad manager'. Interviewees across all hierarchical levels defined a good man-

</p>
<p>ager as a person who is empathic, fair, encourages career development and mo-
tivates staff. 
</p>
<p>He is really good. It's not that I mean to say that he has so much ex-
perience as a manager but he is simply suitable for it and he has these 
human qualities and he learns. He adjusts, he is empathetic, he does 
not have prejudices, he treats everyone equally. I think he is the ideal 
boss ... there are not many of this kind. (P43:32) 
</p>
<p>An intern in a completely different hierarchical position who spent 9 months on 
a non-paid contract also points to the human qualities of the manager as well as 
the appreciation of the work as done by a motivating manager: 
</p>
<p>Well, it came across that the work that I did, the texts that I wrote 
were actually used, and that I did not do a stupid or useless job. This 
was some sort of confirmation for me. At the same time they always 
told me what I did not do well. I had the feeling that I was taken seri-
ously in any aspect. (P30: 12) 
</p>
<p>Similarly, a manager expressed the importance of motivation and support being 
a supervisor of superiors him/herself: 
</p>
<p>The motivation is the crucial part. For each individual you have to 
find an individual strategy. It takes more time but if you don't do it 
they will not understand the same thing. Everyone can come to me 
and ask again to make sure we all talk about the same. (P18:06) 
</p>
<p>To reduce negative criticism, the UN reform, which was instigated in 2006 by 
Kofi Annan, targeted several topics a major one being the aim to improve the 
current management situation. Unfortunately, this reform could not be realised 
because of a negative vote of several member countries. 
Resistance to change seems to be very strong and the vote against the proposed 
reform is probably the best example for this movement against change as cap-
tured by the interviewee below: 
</p>
<p>You have to manage change very very carefully in this organisation. 
You have to package it in such a way that it is not threatening the 
people; that they don't get scared and then they accept it. Because if 
people don't accept change it could be very bad. And right now, the 
UN is in a situation that people don't expect change. Even the coun-

</p>
<p>tries don't expect. You know, they just voted against the UN reform 
actually. The UN reform package did not pass. Everyone is talking 
about reform but the reform package did not pass because the devel-
oping countries voted against it and they had a majority because out of 
191 countries they had 91 member states and it was a simple vote, 
every country has one vote and they have the majority there and they 
oppose it. (P47:66) 
</p>
<p>Summary: 
Summing up this section on the organisational level of the United Nations Sys-
tem as well as on the role of management several conclusions can be drawn and 
will be explained in more detail in the following. 
All United Nations organisations which were part of this study were character-
ised by a strong hierarchy. This hierarchy is reflected in the categorisation of 
staff members into different bands which comprise different levels of power as 
well as a specialisation of tasks. However, depending on the band, this speciali-
sation varies. Band 1 staff, or general staff, predominately reported of routine-
tasks whereas Band 4 staff, or senior management, reported the opposite. 
The strong hierarchy and specialisation of tasks imply that the formal structure 
of the United Nations Organisations under investigation does not incorporate a 
formal team structure. Apart from a strong hierarchy, interviewees also reported 
a strong bureaucracy with numerous rules and regulations and a high level of 
record keeping. This intense bureaucracy is explained as being necessary to as-
sure accountability in a political, intergovernmental organisation whose special-
ised organisational units are financed by governmental money and/or member-
ship fees. Hierarchy and bureaucracy are the main influences on organisational 
life as pointed out by the majority of interviewed staff. Amongst other, the per-
sonnel system especially has been described as being affected by hierarchy and 
bureaucracy. The recruitment process is very lengthy, contracts differ from posi-
tion to position, promotions are based on seniority and not on merit, and a 
change of position involves the whole application process all over again. 
To overcome hierarchic and bureaucratic hurdles, individuals start to break 
down boundaries by finding ways of communication outside the hierarchical 
structure and its rules and regulations. By doing so, networks and parallel sys-
tems to the official system evolve. The reasons for boundary spanning activities 
can be numerous, e.g. a lack of information or the need for swift decisions or 
actions. 
The relationship between management and employees has been identified as be-
ing crucial. Management can be seen as the major link between employees and 
the organisation as the manager is the most immediate and tangible representa-
tion of the organisation in the eyes of the individual employee. The quality of

</p>
<p>the exchange relationship between an employee and his/her manager is pivotal 
in determining the employees future within the organisation (Sparrowe &amp; Liden, 
1997). 
Interviewees believe that a 'good manager' who motivates and empowers them 
is the key to successful group and team work. However, the criticism of man-
agement as being too politically appointed and the rotation principle hamper the 
relationship between employees and their superiors. 
The following Network View visualises the relation of components and the 
'groundedness' of each code in the data by quantifying how many quotations are 
grounded in a code. It also shows the number of links made to other codes, the 
so called density. The numbers in the brackets next to the characteristics repre-
sent groundedness and density:

<p>4.3.3. Employee - Co-worker relationship 
The employee-co-worker relationship is at the core of group work as it is 
strongly reliant on social aspects and driven by individual attributes. Where the 
employee-management relationship contains elements of economic exchange 
(e.g. salaries), the employee-co-worker relationship is almost exclusively driven 
by social and psychological components of exchange. So far, data analysis re-
vealed that this relationship is strongly influenced by organisationally induced 
factors. As explained earlier, the hierarchy of the organisation and the standardi-
sation of tasks are the basis for the employee-management relationship and also 
for the employee-co-worker relationship. The categorisation into bands and the 
type of task an individual fulfils set the stage for group work or collaboration of 
individuals. The interaction with co-workers will vary as some tasks involve in-
tensive communication and exchange, whereas others involve comparably little 
interaction. 
Further data analysis revealed that on an employee-co-worker level diversity in 
its various forms has the strongest impact on interaction patterns and on group 
behaviour. Moreover, the interviewee's narratives unfolded on a continuum: on 
a general level, diversity in national origins of individuals and associated stereo-
types were reported in a neutral way, meaning that these characteristics of co-
workers do not impact or influence the overall work environment. However, 
when individuals talked about group work or collaboration, cultural diversity in 
its various facets was reported to be a strong factor of influence on work. Inter-
viewees alluded to diversity in gender and age, diversity in working styles and 
language and their influence on the work environment. Further topics that were 
marginally mentioned by interviewees related to a different feeling of time, hu-
mour and different sources of conflict and ways to solve them. 
Each of the nuances of diversity mentioned by interviewees are visualised in the 
network view below (figure 8) and will be explained in detail:

<p>4.3.1 Diversity 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.1. Nationality and culture 
The United Nations Organisation, by its very nature, is a multinational place as 
the name itself suggests. Subsequently, it is also a multicultural place with di-
verse ethical, religious and socioeconomic structures. As a consequence, en-
counters of diverse nationalities and cultures are a fact of daily work life. 
Culture according to Hofstede ( 1997) is conceptualised as "collective program-
ming of minds" suggesting that from the time of birth values and beliefs specific 
to our own culture and society are programmed into our minds. Culture, fur-
thermore, can be seen as a set of dimensions which determine our behaviour and 
patterns of interaction. Because the United Nations Organisation comprises 191 
nationalities, a question to raise in this context is whether or not nationality and 
national culture matter to staff members. There are two views on when national-
ity matters in existing literature: one assumes that nationality does matter to em-
ployees because of different values and preferences with regard to management 
and leadership which are related to national and cultural background (see 
e.g.Hofstede, 2001; Schwartz, 1994; Trompenaars &amp; Hampden-Turner, 1997). 
The contrary view suggests that nationality does not matter because of other, 
stronger factors like age, gender or profession and education. According to the 
latter, people from different national backgrounds working at the same hierar-
chical level have more in common with each other than with people from their

<p>94 
</p>
<p>same cultural background. Both views are represented in the data which corre-
sponds to a more recent and dynamic view of culture based on the political, eco-
nomical and technical consequences of globalisation. This view alludes to a 
world community which shares a common set of values, attitudes, norms and 
behaviours (Bird &amp; Stevens, 2003). 
According to the majority of interviewees national diversity per se is not salient 
in the work context. It is seen as a 'normal' component of work life. Moreover, 
interviewees relate nationality to foreignness and highlighted the fact that every-
one in the organisation is a foreigner and therefore the foreignness is not salient. 
With the words of several interviewees: 
</p>
<p>For me, this multiculturalism is relatively normal. Because I have 
worked in an international field for quite a long time. (Pl 3:48) 
</p>
<p>One thing that is really positive is that nationality does not play any 
role in mutual approach. Here, we are all foreigners. (P7:07) 
</p>
<p>You get used to it [multiculturalism], it is routine to sit in front of a 
person from India. [ ... ] It is not like in a family but everyone who 
works here comes from a foreign country and we all feel bonded be-
cause we are all foreigners. Also the Austrians, for them it is just like 
they were foreigners as well. (P21: 15) 
</p>
<p>The notion 'we are all foreigners' refers to the above explained view of a world 
community in which nationality does not matter. The interviewee's statements 
may derive from their interpretation of article 100 of the UN Charta which stipu-
lates: 'In performance of their duties the Secretary-General and the staff shall 
not seek or receive instructions from any government of from any other author-
ity external to the Organisation. They shall refrain from any action which might 
reflect on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organi-
sation.' (Charter,; UN, Chapter 15, Article JOO). 
An interviewee makes the point by referring to the United Nations as a 'com-
mon nationality': 
</p>
<p>There is article 100 of the UN Charta which says that we are no na-
tional representatives we are, so to speak, without nationality. The UN 
is our nationality. From the moment you work for the UN you can not 
say any more that you are Austrian. You also have to sign something.

<p>95 
</p>
<p>You are allowed to vote but you must not cany out any political ac-
tivities. (P40: 12) 
</p>
<p>Other interviewees pinned down foreignness to the physical building of the 
United Nations Organisation. A number of interviewees described that the en-
trance into the building with all its security checks made them feel to enter an-
other world. As expressed by two interviewees: 
</p>
<p>You need to show a passport when you want to get in and it makes 
you feel like you are in a different country. (P22:23) 
</p>
<p>We are not in Austria. (P7:34) 
</p>
<p>At the same time, however, more than three quarters of interviewees report of 
special care and attention which is paid to cultural differences and which result 
in increased awareness: 
</p>
<p>You need to be very considerate because everyone has a different atti-
tude. You need to approach each other slowly and carefully and you 
need to reduce prejudices. This may sound negative but in real life it is 
not like that. You may have to invest a little bit more time but you can 
learn this. (P5:06) 
</p>
<p>You need to have a lot of respect. You have to learn not to hurt feel-
ings and not to be too fast with judgement. [ ... ] An open attitude is the 
best thing which you can bring in such an organisation. (P25:06; 
P25:07) 
</p>
<p>Generally speaking I would say that the people here are very open 
minded and maybe they are a little bit more sensitive because of the 
fact the everyone is a foreigner. Not to take everything for granted. 
(P46:71) 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.2. Stereotypes 
The point at which nationality and cultural diversity definitely become salient to 
the interviewees is when direct interaction with people from other cultures takes 
place. At this stage, the previous notion that nationality does not affect interac-
tions loses power as interviewees also started to include racial and ethic stereo-
types in their narratives. Racial and ethical stereotypes are pervasive, persistent, 
frequently negative and often self-contradictory. Most of us hold stereotypical 
views of other races or cultures and ourselves. Moreover, such stereotypes ex-

<p>96 
</p>
<p>hibit remarkable stability over years and personal experience is not necessary to 
form stereotypes. (Alderfer &amp; Thomas, l 988) 
The following quotes best capture these insights: 
</p>
<p>The South Americans are usually very very funny and easy going but 
also in Asia it depends on where the people come from. We have very 
untypical French guys, for example, French people who do not enjoy 
eating and drinking wine. Suddenly you see that there are not only 
French guys who love to eat. And then one stops saying the Italians 
are like this, the French are like that, a Latin American is like that. 
(P6:l5) 
</p>
<p>We do have a couple of Americans who do not care about anything at 
all. [laughter] (P8: 14) 
</p>
<p>The usual verbal teasing just like between Austria and Germany. 
(Pl 7:60). 
</p>
<p>However, stereotypes are not solely the triggers which make employees con-
sciously notice national and cultural diversity of their co-workers. The data 
analysis also showed that national diversity becomes salient when related to 
team and group work, in the following quote especially with regards to language 
(language will be discussed in more detail later on): 
</p>
<p>The only time I think about nationality is when they don't speak Eng-
lish well and then I start to think why they don't speak English well. 
(P28: 13) 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.2.1. Excursus: Working in the field 
All of the interviewed people self-reported that they notice stereotypes when 
working in the field and equally strongly experienced cultural diversity. To work 
in the field in United Nations jargon means to work outside the headquarters as 
an expatriate. Work in the field usually involves work in developing countries 
and is seen as a means for transferring the headquarters' knowledge to the field. 
When working in the field, interviewees had to cope with host culture work en-
vironments which differ to Western standards with regards to productivity and 
performance as well as punctuality, decision making and concepts of authority. 
Acculturation 
Acculturation strategies to different cultures have been extensively discussed in 
the relevant literature. Berry (l 984) distinguishes between two types of accul-

<p>97 
</p>
<p>turation based on maintenance of cultural identity or building up of relationships 
with other groups. The outcome of either acculturation process has been concep-
tualised as intercultural adjustment (Ward, 1996). 
The data analysis also revealed that interviewees chose either of the two accul-
turation processes. The quote of the following interviewee can be categorised as 
an approach of maintenance of cultural identity which however, does not appear 
to be easy: 
</p>
<p>I try not to acculturate but you get slower because everything takes 
much more time. You have another problem for example in Africa, 
they never say no, we can not do it. For us it would not be a problem, 
just tell me that you can't do it and I will find another solution. In Af-
rica they don't say it and work simply does not get done. That's a 
huge problem and it happens all the time. (Pl 6: 17) 
</p>
<p>Contrarily, the next interviewees describe an adaptation to the behaviours in the 
host country and the building up of relationships with other groups according to 
their cultural standards: 
</p>
<p>With regards to the working style, it is a learning process: you have to 
learn to deal with different pattern of behaviour. The people in my of-
fice are very much process orientated. So you try to be less impatient 
and allow others more time. (Pl4:52) 
</p>
<p>You accommodate to how it works in a country ... that an agreement 
on the phone is not taken seriously, or when organizing an event you 
do not take it too seriously that every 100 percent is fulfilled but you 
try to get it done and make it work. (Pl3: 19) 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.2.2 Feeling of time 
Respondents who have had work experience in the field repeatedly reported of a 
different feeling of time as a major issue when working in another country. In-
terviewees described a divers understanding of time which is in line with exist-
ing research about different understandings of time among cultures 
(Trompenaars &amp; Hampden-Turner, 1997). The latter distinguish between a 
monochronic time approach which suggests that time is conceived as a line of 
sequential events and a polychronic time approach which allows numerous ac-
tivities at the same time. Austrians are categorised as having a monochronic un-
derstanding of time and hence, are insistent on punctuality.

<p>Fink &amp; Meierewert (2004) discovered two types of time behaviours in East and 
Central Europe: slow speed of task solving and extreme length of negotiations 
and decision making processes. They explain these types of time behaviour in a 
tendency to work in collectives rather than teams and in the priority setting 
power of supervisors rather than employees. 
Both types of behaviours are also supported in the data: 
</p>
<p>One guy in our office sometimes really gets upset because reports are 
not finished despite a deadline. But his superior says that he has talked 
to some other people and they have great input and we should wait for 
it so in the end it can take weeks until we finally get the report. Of 
course it may be a really great input but a deadline is no deadline any 
more and this is sometimes difficult. (P14:63) 
</p>
<p>... to understand that by tomorrow does not mean by tomorrow but by 
someday. If they say maniana it means by sometime and you must not 
expect that it means by tomorrow. (Pl3:06) 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.3. Gender 
</p>
<p>One of the most problematic stereotypes for organisations in general is the gen-
der stereotype. Since the early 1970s when researchers conducted the first stud-
ies on stereotypes they have essentially stayed the same up until now. These 
studies have determined that successful management is related to traits and atti-
tudes which are similar to those generally ascribed to men, that is, qualities such 
as leadership ability, competitiveness, self-confidence, ambitiousness, and ob-
jectivity (Brenner, Tomkiewicz, &amp; Schein, 1989; Schein, 1975). More recent 
research describes good managers as possessing less masculine characteristics 
than in past decades; however, it still indicates that both men and women of 
varying age, education, and work experience predominately refer to masculine 
characteristics when describing good managers (Powell, Butterfield, &amp; Parent, 
2002). Considering the number of woman in the workforce, they are severely 
underrepresented in managerial jobs and top-level positions. This stereotype is 
also true for the United Nations Organisation. A simple demonstration of the 
gender problematic can be found at the very top level of management: since the 
founding of the United Nations in 1945 all Secretary Generals were male. The 
same pattern exists on the Directors level and on the Professional level. 
United Nations staffing policies aim at an equal participation and representation 
of gender across all hierarchies. A 50/50 gender distribution in all posts in the 
professional category as well at a director's level and above is a goal set by the 
General Assembly (Fernandez, 2005). To meet this goal the following measures 
have been taken: whenever a job vacancy is announced, priority is given to seek 
female staff within the organisation as well as outside of the organisation. Fur-

<p>99 
</p>
<p>thermore, accelerated promotions of female staff members apply until the goal 
of gender equality is met. Both measures only apply provided the female candi-
date complies with the requirements for the vacant job with regards to qualifica-
tions and experience. 
In reality the gender stereotype appears to be a delicate topic. As explicated by 
two male interviewees who describe a reversed stereotype: 
</p>
<p>I can think of an example in which I personally was the bogeyman. A 
P5 post was advertised, a directors post, and a woman applied for it. 
We all agreed that this woman was not qualified for the job and I also 
communicated it this way. And imagine, in the end I was drawn in 
front of the committee in NY and in NY they called me an adversary 
of women just because I said that this women was not qualified for the 
post. (P3 l :47) 
</p>
<p>Yes, there are gender issues. The posts are split 50:50 but it will take 
some time until senior functions will be carried by women. The first 
woman who applied for a senior post was too young. There were few 
female candidates because men have been favourites. At the moment, 
women are clearly privileged and so it is difficult for men. (P49: 103) 
</p>
<p>However, gender stereotypes tend to favour women when they are being consid-
ered for 'women's' jobs or for 'women's tasks as illustrated by the following 
quote: 
</p>
<p>I work with 25 women because the jobs are very administrative and 
need attention to details. Women are better in this than men. (P18:23) 
</p>
<p>4.3.1.4. Language 
The United Nations Organisation uses six official languages in its intergovern-
mental documents and meetings: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and 
Spanish. The Secretariat uses two working languages: English and French. 
The daily working language of the sample predominately is English which is to 
47 out of the 50 interviewed persons a foreign language. 
Communication is a vital and major part of team and group work. At the same 
time, one of the main barriers to communication is that individuals speak differ-
ent languages. Therefore, a common language has to be used which most of the 
time is not the native language of the members of the group. Several researchers 
have noted that the level of language proficiency effects team and group work 
and demonstrated its crucial role. Findings indicate that language has a consid-

<p>erable impact on socialisation processes and that the use of a common work lan-
guage may result in unsuccessful communication and ambiguity (Feely &amp; 
Harzing, 2003; Henderson, 2005; Marschan, Welch, &amp; Welch, 1997). 
An Interesting insight of the current study is that only non native interviewees 
reported about this very language barrier and about its consequences on com-
munication. 
The comment of a native speaker: 
</p>
<p>Language is not a problem for me since I am native speaker, I can't 
tell how non-native speakers feel about it. (P20:35) 
</p>
<p>Compared to the remarks of non native English speakers: 
</p>
<p>It does make a difference to communicate in your non-native language 
all the time. Even tough you know English very well it is not your 
mother tongue and you can not express yourself like in your mother 
tongue. So it is more difficult to communicate. (P13:23) 
</p>
<p>What I notice is the language barrier. The fact that people come from 
many different countries is not beneficial for communication. With 
native speakers who fluently speak the language it is sometimes a 
problem - at least for me. (P2:06) 
</p>
<p>Sometimes things happen and you think that the collaboration does 
not work a hundred percent. These are often language barriers and 
communication problems. (P5:61) 
</p>
<p>To overcome these barriers, the same interviewee described to choose simple 
language to make sure that the content of the communication becomes clear: 
</p>
<p>You are definitely not faster, it takes some time and in some cases you 
use a simple level of communication. It takes longer to transfer 
knowledge or to tell someone your wishes. (P5:27) 
</p>
<p>Others narrated that technical language serves to overcome barriers. Technical 
language as an element of a professional culture which is characterised by a spe-
cific type of vocabulary helps to at least partly overcome language deficiencies:

<p>IOI 
</p>
<p>We communicate on a very technical level.. .. there are certain expres-
sions which we use and so on this very technical level the communica-
tion works. However, when it comes to discuss problems or when we 
say, well the technical part is ok but maybe we should try it differently 
next time, because this might me more effective you need to switch to 
a meta-level and then, yes, then I think communication problems 
arise, when it comes to reflecting the work. (P45:36) 
</p>
<p>The last part of the above quote alludes to the proficiency of English. Although 
excellent knowledge of English is presumed, the data analysis indicates that 
English as a shared language does not ensure efficient communication. Different 
interpretations of underlying meanings based on different cultural norms are the 
source for misunderstandings and in the worst case even conflicts. 
</p>
<p>Sure, he [ a Chinese superior] is very hard to understand because his 
English is so Chinese. But one can interpret what he tries to explain. I 
myself also make mistakes because I realize a couple of days later that 
he meant it differently and that he was right. (P24:42) 
</p>
<p>Slowly a couple of things became clear to me for example that spe-
cific situations of conflict are a result of language problems. On one 
hand it is the careful formulation in German language. Then the 
sender of the message does not transfer what he intends to because 
his English might not be as good so he can not transfer what he wants 
to say from one language to another. (Pl l :06) 
</p>
<p>However, interviewees are aware of the fact that communication in a language 
other than the mother tongue hampers their ability to express themselves. The 
notion that speaking in a non native language feels like speaking on a different 
level has been supported by several interviewees as illustrated by the following 
quotes: 
</p>
<p>You always communicate on a different level. The choice of language 
and what you try to communicate is not clear, and you always have to 
move to another level. You can be really fluent in a language but you 
will never be able to bring it to the point just like you can do it in your 
mother tongue. (Pl 0:45) 
</p>
<p>It becomes a barrier at the moment. IF I do not know a specific word 
that's my own fault. The advantage of working in a foreign language

<p>is that you can use a third room ... we come from the Philippines, 
Burma and Germany, and when we speak in English we all speak in a 
foreign language. (P46:35) 
</p>
<p>The empirical findings above illustrate that communication at the workplace 
takes place at different levels which is depicted by layers of language. These 
layers are interconnected, yet, each single layer may be a source for communica-
tion problems. Everyday spoken and written language used for communication 
between individuals and units and for external communication. Company speak 
refers to a specialised internal language of a whole organisation or company. 
Technical industry language refers to jargons such as 'Eurospeak', the jargon of 
the European Union (Neyer, 2004).

<p>4.3.1.5. Faultlines 
Traditional research into diversity has stipulated that work group diversity may 
affect performance either positively or negatively. Among the positive aspects 
of diversity research suggested increased creativity and innovation attributed to 
the work process. The negative aspects alluded to more complexity in the deci-
sion making processes and hence longer work processes. These findings are also 
in line with other research on diversity and performance as summarised in the

<p>literature review (Bowers et al., 2000; Webber &amp; Donahue, 2001; Williams &amp; 
O'Reilly, 1998). In a similar vein, data analysis revealed the positive and nega-
tive side of diversity. 
The words of two interviewees give account to the positive and negative effects 
of diversity on performance: 
</p>
<p>Multicultural: multi-faceted but processes take much longer 
Monocultural: fast results because there are less potential sources of 
misunderstandings but there is also less innovation. (P14:39) 
</p>
<p>In my view monocultural teams are faster in fulfilling a task because a 
lot of hurdles drop out. However, multicultural teams have the advan-
tage that different perspectives can be integrated into the workflow 
and as a result the quality of work can be increased. (P19:55) 
</p>
<p>However, as also elaborated in the literature review, diversity may affect group 
work not only either positively or negatively but diversity is multifaceted and 
multidimensional. Hence, the effects of one dimension of diversity may be con-
tingent on diversity on other dimensions. This highlights the notion made in the 
literature review that the different kinds of diversity, respectively demographic, 
job related and individual diversity may not be separated from each other but 
rather conceptualised in one framework. The term 'faultlines' which was coined 
by Lau &amp; Murnighan ( 1998) refers to combinations of dimensions of diversity 
which build a basis for differentiation between subgroups. According to the au-
thors, 'faultlines' are 'hypothetical dividing lines that may split a group into 
subgroups based on one or more attributes.' (Lau &amp; Murnighan, 1998, p. 328). 
These faultlines or subgroups based on different attributes were also found in the 
data. For example, cultural diversity was also reported in connection with other 
types of diversity such as gender, race, age and functional diversity. 
The following quotes for example illustrate the interplay of race, hierarchical 
position and age: 
</p>
<p>Especially among 'white' senior managers you can still feel that they 
feel superior and they also show it even if not directly. Younger col-
leagues are mostly more horizontal, more sensitive and more open to-
wards other cultures. (P49: 44) 
</p>
<p>There are people who discriminate themselves. I have African col-
leagues who do it. But also: woman have to work twice as hard as 
men to be the same. (P25: 15) 
</p>
<p>Let me take as an example India in 2001. We had difficulties to get a 
woman, our team member, into the tent. There were doctors from In-

<p>dia who did not accept that women sleep in the same tent as men. But 
there was no other alternative and we needed these women in our team 
to communicate with the weak population, weak in this situation, the 
children and women in a natural catastrophe. So these are hurdles 
which one has to overcome. Nationality is a sensitive area, gender is 
another sensitive area in teambuilding. (P42:36) 
</p>
<p>There is sometimes some sort of a generation conflict. This is not so 
intercultural, but I am the youngest in my immediate environment. I 
am 20, the others are 35 and then 45 and older. We all have a different 
view of the world. It is not so much age it is more blindness by rou-
tine. (Pl 1:34) 
</p>
<p>Faultlines also emerged based on functional diversity and age. 
As in many hierarchical organisations, seniority is directly linked to age as the 
process of promotion is based on the number of years with the organisation and 
not on merit. A the same time however, the assumption that a certain age range 
of a person is related to the person's physical, psychological, and intellectual 
capabilities is also true for the United Nations organisations. These two assump-
tions create a faultline which suggests that older employees are more reluctant to 
induce changes than younger employees and that older employees do not pos-
sess the skills requested for a changing work place. As reflected in the interview 
data: 
</p>
<p>If I wanted to discriminate against, I would do it via age in the sense 
that the UN has changed a lot. Let's say it used to be an organisational 
forum to build and maintain a dialog between east and west while to-
day UNOPS and UNDP mainly provide development aid and post cri-
sis aid, so the skill set has changed significantly. Nowadays we actu-
ally need more engineers, business administrators, lawyers and not so 
many international relations people any more. People here hold posi-
tions which are rather manager positions than international relations 
positions, and you often notice that they lack management skills. 
When these people started 20 years ago the UN was completely dif-
ferent. And I would not want to accuse anyone. (P44:3 l) 
</p>
<p>To bring yo_ung blood at a professional level to the organisation, the Junior Pro-
fessional Officer (JPO) Programme was introduced in 1972. This programme 
which runs for 2 to 3 years provides young graduates the opportunity to gain 
substantive job related skills and knowledge for future work in senior positions

</p>
<p>within the United Nations organisations. The JPO's are seen as a promising 
source for changes within the system: 
</p>
<p>JPOs defenitely have a more progressive view than senior manage-
ment. (P49:109) 
</p>
<p>I have to admit that JPOs are model students when it comes to effi-
ciency and efficient costs savings. (P 10:40) 
</p>
<p>Another source for progressive ideas is the UNIDO internship programme. 
Young graduates or students who are about to graduate work on a 6 month basis 
as unpaid interns and conduct research in areas of direct relevance to the organi-
sation. The students get the opportunity to gain work experience in an intergov-
ernmental organisation while the organisation can benefit from fresh ideas at no 
cost. 
</p>
<p>Summary 
Concluding, diversity in its various facets is a major component of group work. 
The charter of the United Nations manifests national and gender diversity and 
the organisational structure naturally creates functional diversity. As in other 
organisations, general stereotypes on nationality and gender also exist in the 
United Nations Organisations. When working in a group or in collaboration, na-
tional and cultural diversity become salient to individuals and different strategies 
are used to cope with diversity. 
The interview data revealed that the use of a common, foreign language as the 
main means of communication creates barriers to team and group interaction. 
Communicated messages can become ambiguous and subject to individual in-
terpretation and in the worst case result in conflict. Strategies to cope with this 
communication barrier are the use of simple language or technical language; 
both minimising the propensity for misunderstandings. Interviewees describe 
being aware of the fact that communication in a foreign language restricts their 
abilities to express themselves as compared to communication in a native lan-
guage. 
Faultlines or subgroups are the result of all the different types of diversity and 
based on different attributes. However, not all faultlines become salient. It de-
pends on 'whether features of the context in which individuals operate highlight 
the faultline' (Polzer, Crisp, Jarvenpaa, &amp; Kim, 2006). In this research setting 
the context is characterised by hierarchy and national diversity which highlight 
faultlines.

</p>
<p>4.3.4. Individual 
Each individual carries a different culture compared to another individual. Be-
cause of its uniqueness, individual culture may be compared to a fingerprint. But 
how to describe individual culture? 
The culture of an individual according to Krentzel ( 1999) comprises several 
components: national culture, ethical culture, sex, age, social background, social 
class, education, profession, and workplace. All of these components vary from 
one individual to the other. Moreover, some components are more salient than 
others. For instance, national and ethical cultures are the most salient character-
istics of individuals and learned from childhood. Education and profession are 
choices that are made at a later stage in life and are easier to learn and to change. 
However, social class and social background play a huge impact on these 
choices. 
</p>
<p>Considering the uniqueness of each individual's culture one might argue that it 
is impossible to generalise characteristics of several individuals. 
Yet, the final notion 'it all depends on the individual' was a very clear and 
strong pattern that emerged throughout the data analysis and hence is explicitly 
grounded in the data. Data analysis revealed three facets of the individual which 
are perceived to have the strongest influence on group work, namely the per-
sonal background of individuals, personality and motivation. Each of the facets 
will be explained in detail and illustrated with quotes. Subsequently, a network 
view will be presented and further propositions will be enunciated. 
</p>
<p>4.3.4.1. Personal background 
</p>
<p>Individual staff in the United Nations Organisations can be characterised as be-
ing very internationally orientated and interested. More than 80% of the inter-
viewed staff has lived and worked in foreign countries either prior to the work 
with the United Nations or as part of it. A considerable number of staff have 
grown up in a multicultural family or in different countries and speak at least 
one foreign language fluently. Other staff have not had international experience 
and therefore were keen to work for the United Nations to gain this experience. 
All of these backgrounds however comprise an affinity for other cultures and 
nations as also explained in the interviews: 
</p>
<p>I am used to working in an international environment which makes 
work much more interesting because you learn and hear from the 
world and not only from a small or specific area. You can overlook 
barriers - this makes life simply more interesting for me. And it helps 
to see world politics with other eyes or from another angle and not the 
way the media and radio present it. (P2: 17)

</p>
<p>I always wanted to work in an international environment because I 
simply find it great to work with people from different nationalities. 
Besides, I always wanted to speak other languages so during a regular 
workday I speak German, English and French. (P9:23) 
</p>
<p>I think the people who start working for the UN bring many good 
qualities. They know many languages and on average they are much 
more international and culturally aware than in a national company. 
So if you work for the UN you know that you have to be open minded 
towards other cultures and I love this aspect. (P40:36) 
</p>
<p>4.3.4.2. Personality 
Data analysis showed in line with existing research the importance of personal-
ity as an influential factor on group work. Interviewees attributed far more im-
portance to a group member's personality than to his/her national and functional 
background. Personality as described by the sample comprises the character of 
individuals, and whether or not someone is empathetic and a team player. 
Interviewees explained this point as follows: 
</p>
<p>I would say you adjust to people, and in my view that does not depend 
on nationality. If I work with someone, I will get to know this person 
and adjust to this person. And just as I said whether this person is 
from Chile, Cuba or somewhere else does not matter. (P3 :06) 
It is completely irrelevant where people come from. Sometimes you 
speak of someone as 'the Indian' or 'the Japanese' at least you know 
who you are speaking of. But personally for me it does not make a dif-
ference where people come from. It more depends on personality than 
on nationality. (Pl 1: 94) 
</p>
<p>Well, my personal feeling is that it does not matter which nationality 
someone belongs to, the character counts. (Pl2:14) 
</p>
<p>To start with I would like to say that it all depends very much on the 
person, on the individual, that's most important. How individuals in-
teract is culturally coded and many cultural factors play a part. Team 
members subconsciously handle this. (Pl5:l l) 
The problems at work don't come from nationality. They could be 
linked but I think it comes more from personality. (Pl8:25)

</p>
<p>I am colour blind. I see the person, not the nationality. (P25: 11) 
</p>
<p>In my view it does not depend on nationality. Of course you work 
with some people more easily than with others but this depends more 
on personality than on nationality. (P29:3 l) 
</p>
<p>4.3.4.3. Motivation 
Individual motivation is a further crucial component of group work and directly 
influences performance. Fink &amp; Holden (2007) relate the concept of motivation 
to three theories of identity established by Jimenez at al. (2004) which are: in-
strumental theory, civic theory, and cultural theory. Instrumental theory suggests 
that perceived personal interests create identities. Civic theory argues that identi-
ties emerge if actors within a group collectively develop rules and goals and 
share the same values. Cultural theory suggests that identity is based on cultural 
heritage, common language, symbols and national networks. Fink &amp; Holden 
(2007) argue that extrinsic motivation fits with instrumental theory as wealth is 
an important part of this theory. Intrinsic motivation is argued to fit with cultural 
theory as shared cultural heritage, language and symbols play an important role. 
Research also suggests that the collection of tasks that comprise the job influ-
ence work motivation (Perry &amp; Porter, 1982). 
In a similar vein, data analysis revealed a positive relationship between the hier-
archical position of interviewees (and respectively the type of task they fulfil) 
and their perception of motivation. High ranking staff commented on intellectual 
stimulation and intellectual freedom as a source of intrinsic motivation. Work is 
perceived to be influential and to make sense. With the words of interviewees: 
</p>
<p>You work for intellectual stimulation. You see what happens and how 
it works out and that rewards you. (P20:33) 
</p>
<p>What you find here is absolute intellectual freedom and that's what 
makes work here so special and for sure is the main part of motiva-
tion. There is no other job in which you have so much intellectual 
flexibility, there are hardly any boundaries. No matter what you can 
suppose it as long as the frame conditions are fulfilled. Because there 
is need in development, in the area we work. And that's what makes 
work here so special. (P29:43) 
</p>
<p>Repetitive tasks or very well structured tasks on the other hand are perceived as 
being a source of demotivation. Therefore, staff strive for job variety as illus-
trated by the following two quotes:

</p>
<p>Well, because you do not have the global view which is not possible 
because of daily routine, you quickly just focus on this part and lose 
sight of everything else and this is for sure a source of demotivation. 
(P48:61) 
</p>
<p>My motivation is the variety because I don't solely work for XX but 
also for someone else. The aim of my position was to get to know eve-
rything. To do my own work really well is part of my motivation. 
There are different tasks, sometimes you can chose what you like to 
do sometimes it is not so exciting. (P 11: 127) 
</p>
<p>Some interviewees very honestly remarked that the high level of remuneration 
and the generous benefits are a further source of motivation. This kind of moti-
vation relates to extrinsic motivation and instrumental theory of identity. In the 
words of two respondents: 
</p>
<p>It is very simple - I earn double of what I earn at University. (P24:08) 
</p>
<p>One of the major reasons for motivation is the fact that the pay is tax 
free. I would say everyone who is honest would have to name this rea-
son. I would have to have super super job somewhere in the top level 
management of Siemens to earn so much money. (P9:23) 
</p>
<p>However, some interviewees commented critically on the negative sides of high 
remuneration. In a worst case scenario the motivation to work shifts to a motiva-
tion to simply keep the job and its benefits. 
</p>
<p>I think it all started when they set up the system. Specifically the HR 
system with the benefits and everything. (P47:98) 
You lose that vision very easily. I think. Especially if you are con-
cerned about the benefits like I need to stay because of the pension or 
they pay my kids the tuition at the school, I mean it is very tough. 
(P47:106) 
</p>
<p>Summary: 
Summing up, the individual and his/her personal background, motivation and 
personality impact on the overall work situation and especially group work. 
The personal background of most interviewees is very similar with regards to 
internationally orientated education or work experience. Moreover, the com-

</p>
<p>ments on motivation clearly show that the main source of motivation comes 
from the feeling of interviewees being part of an organisation with global influ-
ence. However, on a daily work basis this motivation may be strongly influ-
enced by job characteristics, including tasks. The latter ones are directly related 
to the hierarchical position, hence, senior level staff report intellectual motiva-
tion while general staff find motivation in a variation of tasks. Some young in-
terviewees criticised the obvious motivation by remuneration and benefits which 
due to social desirability bias supposedly has not been self-reported. It appears 
that the role of personality is very decisive. In line with findings in literature it 
can be assumed that specific personality traits are supportive of group work and 
collaboration.

<p>V. Model and Propositions 
</p>
<p>5.1. Introduction 
The previous chapter presented results of the empirical analysis of 50 interviews 
conducted in five Organisations of the United Nations Organisation. In the 
course of constant comparison and a deep analysis of interview data, pivotal pat-
terns which helped to answer the two research questions of this study emerged. 
These patterns were grouped into categories which depict the factors of influ-
ence on the work environment. The research questions will again be presented 
and each of the categories that have been developed will be discussed in detail. 
Furthermore, a conceptual model of group work in an intergovernmental organi-
sation will be presented as well as propositions which have been deduced from 
the empirical findings. 
</p>
<p>Research question 1: What kind of team/group work exists in the United Na-
tions? 
Research question 2: What are the factors of influence? 
</p>
<p>The answers to the two research questions unfolded themselves in a process. 
The vantage point being an assessment of what kind of team/group work is prac-
tised in the United Nations Organisations under investigation. Data analysis re-
vealed a typology of group work that is grounded in the interview data and di-
rectly related to the developed categories. The typology comprises: 
</p>
<p>&bull; task forces described as a temporary group that are given a specific prob-
lem to solve, 
</p>
<p>&bull; project groups which carry out specific projects within a given time 
frame, and, 
</p>
<p>&bull; collaborating individuals which predominately work on individual tasks 
in collaboration with co-workers. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the analysis in the course of answering research question 1 revealed a 
complex set of factors which influence the work environment. These factors 
were reduced to three main categories as shown in figure 6 and explained 
throughout chapter IV. All of the categories have been identified as being major 
and intertwined influences on group work and collaboration. The three main 
categories are: 
</p>
<p>&bull; the organisational context ( organisational structure and culture), 
&bull; the relationship between managers and employees as well as the re-
</p>
<p>lationship between employees and co-workers, and 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>112 
</p>
<p>&bull; the individual and his/her personal background, personality and 
motivation. 
</p>
<p>Lastly, boundary spanning activities have been identified as a moderator. 
The empirical analysis furthermore showed that there are mutual causal relation-
ships between the factors of influence and that these factors are highly interde-
pendent. An integrative view of all factors of influence leads to a conceptual 
model of group work in five Organisations of the United Nations Organisation 
which are illustrated in figure 11. 
</p>
<p>5.2. Model 
</p>
<p>The model shows at the very top the formal structure of the United Nations Sys-
tem as an overarching element which directly influences group work. The circle 
in the middle of the model represents the group which best can be described by 
the relationships between employees and managers and the relationships be-
tween employees and co-workers. The position of the management on top of the 
individual aims at showing the closeness of management to the organisation as 
well as the position of power of management. Ultimately, the relationships be-
tween individual employees are closely linked to the individual characteristics of 
employees comprising their personal backgrounds, personality and job motiva-
tion. Whilst the individual can be seen as a major component of group work, the 
boundary activities illustrated by arrows represent the moderator of group work. 
Lastly, all of the described properties of group work constitute the culture of the 
organisation. 
The properties of the model have been described in detail throughout the empiri-
cal analysis in chapter IV. The next part of this chapter aims at discussing the 
propositions which can be deduced from the underlying empirical findings of 
the conceptual model.

<p>5.3. Propositions 
The following propositions are deduced from and grounded in the data and ad-
dress the factors of influence on group work and the barriers for team work in 
the context of an intergovernmental organisation, respectively five Organisa-
tions of the United Nations Organisation. The propositions will be developed 
according to the categories of influence which have been identified throughout 
the data analysis. 
</p>
<p>5.3.1. Organisation 
Data analysis showed that the typology for group work is determined by the 
structure of the organisations under investigation and their culture. In line with 
existing research ( e.g. Rousseau &amp; Fried, 2001) this research has shown that the 
description of the context of a particular organisation is vital to understand un-
derlying processes and phenomena. 
Hence, in the following propositions with regards to the organisational structure 
and culture as a factor of influence comprising the context of the organisation 
will be discussed. 
The strong hierarchy and specialisation of tasks implies that the formal structure 
of the United Nations Organisations under investigation is not yet compatible 
with a team structure. The concept of hierarchy and the concept of team work 
are found to be mutually exclusive in this specific context. However, there is 
evidence grounded in the data that group work as per definition is incorporated 
in the structure and actually performed. Nonetheless, the structure of the organi-
sation presumably is stronger than the structure of the group. This shows that it 
is in the hands of the organisation to establish structures that allow for group 
work. As a consequence, it can be assumed that the same it true for team work 
provided that the strong hierarchy will be flattened. 
The propositions aim at underscoring that hierarchy and bureaucracy, which are 
both major components of the organisational structure of the five organisations, 
and which were found to challenge the introduction of teams, should not be re-
garded as a barrier. It is rather suggested to use the advantages of these major 
components as a tool which has the potential to support the introduction of team 
structures. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 1: The hierarchy of the United Nations System chal-
lenges the introduction of teams and overarches the work of groups 
and individuals. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 1 a: Hierarchy should be associated with responsibility 
rather than with restriction.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>115 
</p>
<p>Proposition 1 b: Hierarchy should be seen a factor of stability for indi-
viduals rather than an element of power. 
</p>
<p>An intensive bureaucracy is explained to be necessary to assure accountability in 
a political, intergovernmental organisation whose individual organisations are 
financed by governmental money and/or membership fees. Moreover, the rules 
and regulations offer stability and predictability. However, the plethora of rules 
and regulations was reported to be a factor which limits group work, the reason 
being that individuals may only act if authority is granted. The latter ultimately 
involves numerous administrative tasks which are described to take up a major 
part of individuals' work responsibilities and in tum keep individuals from 
working collectively. On the other hand, interviewees reported that bureaucracy 
is the only stable factor in a frequently changing environment which demands 
lots of flexibility from the individual. Moreover, the rules and regulations help 
to neutralise diversity in the sense that they can be learned and understood by 
everyone and regulate in such a detail that a misinterpretation becomes less 
likely. If bureaucracy is seen as a factor which offers consistency and helps to 
deal with diversity it may also be regarded as a means to facilitate group and 
team work by reducing complexity in a multicultural context. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 2: The bureaucracy of the United Nations System over-
arches group and individual work. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 2a: Bureaucracy assures accountability. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 2b: Bureaucracy is associated with responsibility 
</p>
<p>Proposition 2c: Bureaucracy offers consistency in a frequently chang-
ing environment. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 2d: Bureaucracy is a factor that neutralises diversity. 
</p>
<p>It is also suggested that the Human Resource Management should be adapted for 
a team and group based structure. 
The Human Resource Management of the United Nations Organisations studied 
is depicted by three salient factors: firstly, there exists a variety of different con-
tracts for staff that are categorised in the same band and fulfil similar tasks. This 
triggers inequality and resentment between individuals. A streamlining of these 
contracts would not only facilitate bureaucracy but also reduce inequalities. 
Secondly, another distinctive aspect of the Human Resource system is the per-
formance appraisal system which is solely based on individual evaluation and 
not on group evaluation. A change towards a group based performance evalua-

<p>116 
</p>
<p>tion would be highly recommended to improve group spirit and effort. Thirdly, 
job rotation involves a regular change of positions and locations of individuals. 
Rotation negatively influences the identification of individuals with a group. 
The rotation principle may not be changed. However, rotating staff should make 
sure to build up on existing group structures and norms rather than to change 
them and reduce the identification of individuals as a group. 
Hence, the following three propositions can be deduced from the findings: 
</p>
<p>Proposition 3: In a hierarchical context, the Human Resource Man-
agement needs to be adapted for team and group work. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 3a: A streamline of contracts among staff with same func-
tions and responsibilities reduces inequalities. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 3b: A performance appraisal system which is based on 
collective performance evaluation encourages group and team efforts. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 3c: The rotation process needs to respect group and team 
structures to keep the identification of individuals as a group and 
team. 
</p>
<p>Another aspect of HRM, the personnel development system, has been described 
as being very competitive with regards to job promotions. The latter ones are 
dependent on available plan positions which themselves are subject to geo-
graphical filling. Furthermore, a promotion within the hierarchy depends on sen-
iority and not merit. It is strongly suggested that an adapted personnel system 
should also consider skills which enhance and support group and team work as a 
factor for promotion. 
</p>
<p>To overcome hierarchic and bureaucratic barriers, the organisation and individu-
als break down boundaries and span new ones. On an organisational level break-
ing down of boundaries is being done by raising the awareness of the impor-
tance of group and team work and by holding respective training. Individual 
boundary activities create networks beyond hierarchical structures as well as 
parallel systems to the official system. Boundary activities should be encouraged 
as they increase communication and effectiveness. Boundary spanning activities 
may be seen as new structures for cooperation between individuals which form 
the ground for team and group structures. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 4: Boundary breaking and boundary spanning activities 
positively enhance work on an organisational and on an individual 
level.

</p>
<p>Proposition 4a: Boundary breaking on an organisational level is a sys-
tem improving strategy. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 4b: Organisational boundary spanning creates an aware-
ness of the importance of team and group work and sets the formal 
steps which enable group and team work 
</p>
<p>Proposition 4c: Boundary breaking on an individual level is a suppor-
tive practice to deal with the system. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 4d: Individual boundary spanning creates a parallel sys-
tem to the formal structure which is based on cooperation and com-
munication. 
</p>
<p>5.3.2. Employee - Management Relationship 
The relationship between management and employees has been identified as be-
ing crucial for group work. Management can be seen as the major link between 
employees and the organisation as the manager is the most immediate and tangi-
ble representation of the organisation in the eyes of the individual employee. 
The quality of the exchange relationship between an employee and his/her man-
ager is pivotal in determining the employees fate within the organisation 
(Sparrowe &amp; Liden, 1997). 
To improve the quality of the relationship between managers and individuals, it 
is important to place skilled managers in these crucial positions. Therefore, it is 
vital to appoint managers, who ideally possess of political, economical and so-
cial knowledge and skills. The 'right' managers are task- and relationship orien-
tated and in a position to induce changes on an organisational as well as on an 
individual level. Subsequently, they are also in a position of power to set the 
grounds for team work. Moreover, social skills will help to establish team and 
group awareness. For instance, the quality of management with regards to trust 
and motivation directly influences the propensity of individual employees to en-
gage in group and team work. A symptom of low trust can be seen in the norms 
of communications that group members establish to protect themselves. An ex-
ample of this behaviour is reflected in the use of emails: the sender copies a 
wide range of recipients on the message to make sure that all people up and 
down of the hierarchy are aware of the content. Moreover, the sender also passes 
on responsibility by acting this way. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 5: The role of management is a crucial link between the 
organisation and individuals

</p>
<p>Proposition 5a: Management is in a position of power to raise team 
and group awareness on an organisational level as well as amongst 
subordinates. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 5b: Successful teams and groups need task- and relation-
ship orientated management. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 5c: Intergovernmental organisations require managers 
who possess skills to integrate political, economical and social re-
quirements. 
</p>
<p>5.3.3. Employee - Co-worker Relationship 
</p>
<p>The employee-co-worker relationship is characterised by a variety of factors 
which influence the individual's behaviour with regards to group and team 
work. Diversity is the most salient factor of influence. Ely &amp; Thomas (200 I) 
suggest that diversity is more likely to yield positive outcomes when the organ-
isational context views diversity as an opportunity for learning and integration. 
This is true for the United Nations Organisations under investigation where di-
versity manifests one of the major fundamentals. Diversity is seen as source of 
knowledge. Nonetheless, diversity as a major contextual aspect of group and 
team work triggers several implications. The most salient ones will be discussed 
in the following. 
Overall, the structure of the United Nations Organisations creates an environ-
ment in which national diversity is not salient. This means that the work forces' 
ethical diversity is so high that a dominance of one nationality in daily work life 
is not possible. This phenomenon was reported by interviewees working in the 
locations in Geneva, Vienna and New York. However, people who work in the 
field, which means that they work in foreign countries outside the headquarters, 
reported that national diversity became salient. 
One decisive barrier for group and team work which results from diversity is the 
influence of the use of a second language (which predominately is English) as a 
major means of communication. The proficiency of English determines the de-
gree of mutual understanding among individuals. It is a source of misunder-
standings, misinterpretations and in the worst case results in conflict. Hence, it is 
suggested to reinforce language trainings to reduce this source of misunder-
standing. At the same time, it lies in the hands of management to create an envi-
ronment which knows how to deal with the language barrier and how to over-
come it. 
Despite the fact that diversity is regarded as a source of enrichment, it is at the 
same time a trigger for the creation offaultlines. On one hand it is suggested to

<p>119 
</p>
<p>take advantage of the formation of subgroups as they may also be seen as 
knowledge creating source. On the other hand, flattened team and group struc-
tures might reduce the propensity to form subgroups and encourage acting as 
one entity. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 6: Diversity in its various facets is the major influence on 
the relationship between individuals. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 6a: The culture of intergovernmental organisations creates 
an environment in which diversity is not salient. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 6b: National and cultural diversity become especially sali-
ent when working outside of the headquarters. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 6c: Communication in a second language is a major rea-
son for misunderstandings between individual group members. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 6d: Faultlines are a source of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Proposition 6f: Flattened team structures reduce the formation of sub-
groups. 
</p>
<p>5.3.4. Individual 
To understand an organisation it is vital to examine the individuals in the group 
and their interaction. Data analysis showed that (apart from the organisational 
structure) interviewees ascribe the success of group and team work to the indi-
vidual. 
In the course of data analysis it was revealed that the organisation tries to select 
individuals who share common characteristics with regards to their educational 
background and their international experience. Hence, staff of the United Na-
tions Organisations can be characterised as being experienced in international 
and multicultural work and as being used to diversity at the work place. 
The individual's motivation has been found to be a huge factor of influence on 
work. The feeling of contributing to something that has a positive impact on the 
whole society motivates individuals. This motivation is of relevance for coop-
eration and group work. Analysis suggests that most people who have lost this 
feeling over the years are more reluctant to engage in group work. 
Lastly, the personality of each individual in the group affects group behaviour 
and performance. The unique characteristics of individuals determine whether or 
not two or more individuals are able to constructively work together or not. A fit 
of individuals was reported to be highly important. Both motivation and person-

<p>ality are factors which are not visible but become salient throughout the process 
of collective work. 
</p>

sonality and motivation are factors of influence on group and team 
work.

<p>VI. Discussion and Conclusions 
</p>
<p>6.1. Introduction 
This study aimed at developing an understanding of multicultural work in five 
Organisations of the United Nations guided by two main research questions: 
</p>
<p>&bull; What kind of team and group work in five United Nations Organisations 
exists? 
</p>
<p>&bull; Which factors are a trigger, a barrier, and/or an influence on team and 
group work in this context? 
</p>
<p>These research questions helped to examine three gaps in current research on 
multicultural team and group work. 
First, whereas intense research on teams and groups in international companies 
has been conducted, this study focused on international organisations. The con-
text of international organisations differs in many ways from international com-
panies beginning with the legal base, the financial and operational agenda, the 
cultural impact and also with regards to human resource practices like selection 
of candidates, training, international placements, career management and remu-
neration. As a number of critics have noted ( e.g. Rousseau &amp; Fried, 2001, Jack-
son et al., 2003) a rich description of the context is the key for valid interpreta-
tions ofresearch. 
The second gap that was addressed in this study focused on an evaluation of the 
types of teams and groups that can be found in international organisations. Man-
agement research has produced a plethora of studies on teams and groups in past 
decades. A clear definition of the underlying concepts was, however, found to 
be missing. This study not only evaluated research into teams and groups con-
ducted between 1998 and 2007 but also accentuated the need for clear defini-
tions of constructs as being essential for accurate research. Based on 50 inter-
views a typology of group work in the context of five Organisations of the 
United Nations was provided. Third, this study provided an integrative view of 
the reciprocal relationships between organisation, management, group and indi-
vidual. By looking at the manner in which context affects these relationships, the 
triggers and barriers for team and group work could be explored. This way, the 
current study made an important step towards a more integrative view of organ-
isational behaviour. 
</p>
<p>6.2. Summary ofresearch findings 
A qualitative research design was chosen to conduct this study. 25 semi-
structured interviews with 50 predominately Austrian staff members of five Or-
ganisations of the United Nations in three locations were the basis for this case

<p>study with embedded units of analysis (Yin, 1984). With the help of qualitative 
data analysis software, namely Atlas.ti Version 5, the interviews were analysed 
according to constant comparison method (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967). This 
method proved to be a valid tool to discover patterns and to make sense of a 
huge amount of interview data. 
The results of data analysis and their contextualisation showed a strong influ-
ence of organisational structure on multicultural work. Moreover, the strong hi-
erarchy and bureaucracy in the five Organisations of the United Nations that 
were investigated were found to be the largest barrier for team work. In fact, the 
structure of these Organisations with prevailing hierarchy and task specialisation 
conflicts with team work that is characterised by flat hierarchies. The novelty of 
this study is that data analysis strongly indicated the existence of group work 
and led to develop a typology comprising task forces, project groups, and col-
laboration. This typology emerged throughout the analysis of data and whilst 
discovering triggers and barriers for work in the context of international Organi-
sations. 
From a micro-level of analysis this study illuminated the reciprocal relationships 
between organisation, management, group and individual. By looking at these 
relationships, individual perceptions could be unfolded and an integrative model 
of multicultural work could be developed. 
Overall, the results provided strong evidence that the hierarchical structure of 
the Organisations under investigation is the strongest barrier for team work. At 
the same time boundary breaking and boundary spanning activities on an organ-
isational as well as on an individual level take place to overcome these barriers. 
Team work could be a remedy for institutional slack and as an individual source 
of motivation from each of the actor's point of view. 
In the following the two research questions will be addressed in more detail and 
a summary of the findings will be presented accordingly. 
</p>
<p>What kind of team and group work exists in United Nations Organisations? 
To start with it was reviewed how individuals construe team and/or group work 
in intergovernmental Organisations. Despite the fact that almost all interviewees 
initially used the word 'team' to define their work situation it quickly became 
clear that the underlying meaning did not refer to the term 'team' as per defini-
tion. Interviewees then described the position and tasks of their co-workers or 
superiors. Analysis further showed that around 60 % of all interviewees' inter-
pretations of teams and group work could be categorised around communication 
and coordination. Both elements were described to be essential to fulfil individ-
ual tasks. In the course of their narratives it became clear to respondents that 
some elements which are distinctive for team work were missing in their de-
scription of the work situation. The missing elements could be grouped around a 
lack of decision making power of individuals, a lack of collective performance

<p>measurement and most importantly, the prevalence of a very strong hierarchy 
and bureaucracy. 
In a next step the explanations of the respondents with regard to team and group 
work were compared with theoretical concepts of team and group work in aca-
demic literature. The definitions chosen were provided by Katzenbach &amp; Smith 
(1993) and seemed compelling because of their simple but comprehensive de-
scription. 
</p>
<p>Definition of the term "team": 
A team is a number of 2 or more people who are committed to a common goal 
which is specific and different from each team member's individual goals. Team 
members work collectively to reach this goal. They share leadership roles and 
follow a collective decision making process. Furthermore, the solution to prob-
lems is found in the course of collective discussion. The outcomes of the team 
work are subject to collective performance measurement. 
Definition of the term "group": 
A group is a number of 2 or more people who are committed to a common goal 
which is similar to the broader organisational goals and each group member's 
individual goal. Group members work individually to reach their goals. The 
leadership role is centralised at one person who is also responsible for the deci-
sion making process and who delegates individual tasks. Finally, the outcomes 
of group work are subject to individual performance measurement. 
Based on these clear definitions the following conclusions could be drawn: the 
hierarchical structure implies task specialisation and as a result, individuals 
work on individual tasks. Hand in hand with specialisation comes a differentia-
tion by groups of employees comprising different degrees of authority and 
power. Tasks are delegated in a top down approach and performance is meas-
ured individually. All of these characteristics indicate that teams can not exist in 
the context of the five Organisations of the United Nations under investigation. 
A comparison of the interview data with the definitions referred to the following 
typology of group work including task forces, project groups and collaboration. 
A task force operates temporarily in case of non-routine events or emergency 
events. Once the problem is solved, a task force usually will be dissolved. Con-
ventional hierarchies marginally apply or do not apply to task forces at all. 
A project group is established for the duration of a specific project. Project 
groups typically have an assigned group leader and tasks are assigned according 
to specialisation. 
Collaboration takes place on a regular basis and is not timely limited. The for-
mal hierarchy applies and tasks are executed based on task specialisation. There 
is no necessary common goal among collaborating individuals. 
The characteristics of each of the types are briefly summarised in the table be-
low.

<p>This typology covers the explanations of the 50 interviewed staff members in 
five Organisations of the United Nations, namely IAEA, UNIDO, UNDP, 
UNOPS, and WIPO. 
</p>
<p>Which factors are a trigger, a barrier and/or a factor of influence on team 
and group work in this context? 
Deriving from interview data analysis the main factors which are a barrier, a 
trigger and a factor of influence on team and group work could be classified into 
three categories. These categories are: the organisation, relationships, and indi-
viduals. Each of the categories will be summarised briefly in the following and 
labelled as trigger, barrier or as a factor of influence. 
</p>
<p>Organisation 
The organisation and its structure was found to be a strong barrier for team work 
and an equally strong factor of influence on group work and work in task forces, 
project groups and collaboration. The structure of the United Nations Organisa-
tions under investigation is depicted by hierarchy and bureaucracy. Hierarchy is 
the formal structure which shows different levels of power, responsibility and 
authority. It also identifies accountability. The existence of a strong hierarchy 
was emphasised by 95% of all interviewees. Bureaucracy expressed by rules and 
regulations and perceived as an instrument of power and control dominated by 
the top level of a hierarchy, was described as another strong factor of influence 
on group work and collaboration. According to more than 50 % of all interview-
ees, priority has to be put on understanding and following rules and regulations. 
The personnel system or Human Resource Management of the United Nations 
Organisations can be considered as a factor of influence on group work and is 
also determined by the structure of the organisation. Recruiting processes, con-
tracts, career development, and termination of contracts are equally influenced 
by hierarchy and bureaucracy. The processes were described as being cumber-
some and very lengthy. Recruiting for example is affected by political motives. 
A plethora of different kinds of contractual arrangements exists. One distinctive 
contractual feature is the so called job rotation principle which is applicable for 
predominately high ranking jobs. Rotation is motivated by political issues but

<p>125 
</p>
<p>also a strategy to spread knowledge in a learning organisation. Whilst a change 
in leadership every three years can be seen as a source for fresh ideas, it also 
hinders stability because of changing practices and additional rules and regula-
tions. 
Career development is also restricted by hierarchical structures and influenced 
by political actions. Performance measurement is practised on an individual 
level and as a consequence, individuals try to shed light on individual efforts 
before putting energy and resources in group work. Moreover, this style of per-
formance measurement does not induce group spirit and cohesion. 
Despite strong hierarchies and strict bureaucracy, the Organisation as well as 
individuals are actively breaking down these boundaries and spanning new ones. 
On an organisational level boundary spanning activities emphasise knowledge 
transfer beyond hierarchies and more direct communication neglecting hierar-
chies. The transfer of tacit and explicit knowledge as a source of organisational 
learning and building up of organisational memory is regarded as being vital for 
a well functioning organisation. On an individual level boundary spanning ac-
tivities take place for several reasons: to reduce a deficit in information, to work 
more efficient beyond hierarchy, or to gather information faster. A parallel sys-
tem and network to the formal hierarchy evolves due to boundary activities and 
helps individuals to fulfil their tasks more efficiently. 
Lastly, the culture of the organisation has also been described as being domi-
nated by hierarchy. Symbols like the number of windows in an office or the size 
of an office manifest organisational culture. Pattern of communication in the 
form of jargon and terminology as well as the expression of power by hierarchy 
depict the organisational culture on a visible level. Held values, beliefs, assump-
tions and attitudes that underlie behaviour characterise the invisible level of or-
ganisational culture which was made visible by looking at relationships between 
individuals. 
</p>
<p>Relationships 
Two types of relationships were analysed as being crucial when it comes to ex-
plaining triggers and barriers for task forces, group work and collaboration. 
First, the relationship between employee and management, and second the rela-
tionship between employee and co-worker. Each of them will be summarised 
briefly in the following. 
</p>
<p>Employee - Management Relationship 
Management as perceived by individuals is the major link between employees 
and the organisation. Consequently, individuals' trust and confidence in man-
agement is crucial for successful performance. This trust was explained to be 
spoiled by politically appointed managers and hampered because of frequent

</p>
<p>rotation of managers. Interviewees believe that a manager who builds up trust, 
and motivates and empowers individuals is the key to successful group work. 
The manager is also seen in a position of power to set the stage for team work 
and to trigger group spirit. 
Employee - Co-worker relationship 
The relationship between employees and co-workers is depicted by diversity: 
national and cultural diversity, stereotypes, gender differences, language and 
resulting faultlines, respectively subgroups. The facets of diversity mentioned by 
interviewees will be summarised below. 
By its very nature, the United Nations Organisation is a multicultural work place 
and subsequently national and cultural diversity are facts of life of daily work. 
Interviewees see each other as part of a community in which nationality should 
not matter - just like it is stipulated in the UN Charter. In the course of daily 
work life distinctive characteristics of national culture become salient and influ-
ence work. Data analysis showed that the salience of diversity differs depending 
on the work environment. Interviewees working in the headquarters elaborated 
on cultural differences such as religion and cultural traditions or food. These dif-
ferences were described as being interesting and as factors which make work in 
United Nations Organisations special and exciting. Staff working in the field 
reported differently. Stereotypes and cultural differences were perceived as a 
barrier for effective work. Depending on the country in which interviewees 
gained their field experience, they reported of stronger hierarchies and lines of 
authority as compared to the headquarters, less decision making power for indi-
viduals, different feeling for time and little effort of individuals to take responsi-
bility. The interviewees reported two possible strategies to cope with these dif-
ferences: maintenance of their own cultural identity or building up of relation-
ships with other groups. Both acculturation strategies were equally implied 
among interviewees. 
Gender issues such as under representation of females in top level positions and 
an over representation of women in administrative jobs was reported despite the 
fact that the United Nations staffing policies aim at an equal participation and 
representation of gender across all hierarchies. 
Lastly, language diversity was noted to have a considerable impact on work. 
English as the major language of communication can be a barrier for group work 
from the point of view of non-native English speakers. The individuals' profi-
ciency of English determines whether meetings are dominated by native speak-
ers or not and whether comments of non-native speakers are regarded as compe-
tent or not. 
Austrian interviewees see language as a barrier for communication and ex-
change of information and as a result as a factor of influence on group work. To 
overcome this barrier, interviewees reported of two possibilities: the use of tech-

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>127 
</p>
<p>nical language as an element of professional culture, and the use of simple lan-
guage to ensure that the content of communication becomes clear. 
All of the facets of diversity described above lead to the emergence of faultlines, 
respectively subgroups. Faultlines as defined by Lau &amp; Murnighan (1998) are 
'hypothetical dividing lines that may split a group into subgroups based on one 
or more attributes.' Data analysis strongly supported the existence of subgroups 
because of gender, race, age and functional diversity. A single attribute can be a 
trigger for the creation of a faultline. In a group context, these dividing lines 
cause individuals to see other group members either as part of their in-group or 
as part of an out-group. Research suggests ( e.g. Early &amp; Mosakowski, 2000) that 
groups with maximum diversity experience less dividing lines and the propen-
sity of an emergence of in- and out-groups is smaller. The United Nations Or-
ganisation as a hierarchical organisation especially faces faultlines because of 
strict lines of power and decision. 
A moderating factor of influence on all of the relationships is the individual 
characterised by personal background, personality and motivation. The personal 
background of individuals in this study comprises experience in an international 
context such as growing up in multicultural families and foreign countries. It 
also comprises education and/ or work experience in foreign countries. 
The personality of each individual is a relevant issue when it comes to group 
work. Empirical analysis showed that personality may be supportive for group 
work and collaboration while it may also be a barrier. 
Individual motivation derives from intrinsic motives such as intellectual stimula-
tion or trust that work has an impact while extrinsic motivation is induced by 
remuneration and benefits. 
A conceptual model of group work in five Organisations of the United Nations 
Organisation graphically illustrates the interplay of all the categories described 
in the section above (Figure 11 ).

<p>The following section develops practical advice for management in the United

showed that management is the crucial link between the organisation and the 
individuals, the managerial implications were developed around two main ques-
tions:

<p>oping how group and team work in a hierarchical and diverse intergovernmental 
organisation can be put into practise. 
</p>
<p>How to manage hierarchy and bureaucracy? 
Working for a United Nations Organisation can be a rewarding and fulfilling job 
given the opportunities the United Nations System offers all over the globe. The 
international context characterised by diversity in all aspects of work life, and 
organisational goals that really aim at changing the world seem compelling. 
When working for the United Nations one must not forget, however, that this 
organisation has become very large over the past 61 years and as a consequence, 
hierarchy and bureaucracy became very strong. The latter are a fact of daily 
work life in a world organisation such as the United Nations and mainly aim at 
assuring accountability and clear lines of responsibility and decision making 
power. At the same time hierarchy and bureaucracy were found to be the main 
sources of dissatisfaction. Both were identified as a barrier for team work and a 
major influence on group work and collaboration. 90% of interviewees reported 
perceiving hierarchy and too many rules and regulations as a nuisance in fulfill-
ing their individual tasks. Without any doubt, hierarchy and bureaucracy will 
always be a major characteristic of huge organisations. However, a systematic 
questioning of some of the rules and regulations might show that over the years 
incremental rules and regulations have been introduced without being necessary. 
Management can be seen as central and in a position to reduce rules and regula-
tions to the necessary minimum within the scope of a manager's responsibility. 
Furthermore, management is in a position of power to create a work environ-
ment beyond rules and regulations. Managers may share information equally 
among group members and introduce a culture of discussion and mutual ex-
change. By involving individual staff in the decision making process and by 
valuing individual's opinions and suggestions, a manager not only shares some 
of his/her responsibilities with the group but also increases individual motivation 
and as a result, performance. 
A real remedy for strong hierarchies and institutional slack is the implementa-
tion of teams comprising individuals who work collectively to reach a common 
goal, who share leadership roles and collectively make decisions. Subsequently, 
they should be subject to collective performance measurement. 
Management is in a position to raise team awareness by offering training to in-
dividual staff and by actively breaking down institutional boundaries. Interview-
ees in management positions have reported that all of this is possible and de-
pends on the individual manager's possibilities and effort. 
</p>
<p>How to manage relationships? 
Relationships in the United Nations Organisations are depicted by diversity in 
various facets. National and cultural diversity most strongly influence relation-

</p>
<p>ships. Management has to be aware of the fact that diversity is not only an asset 
but also a barrier. Therefore, a manager of a diverse group has to be sensitive 
towards different norms of behaviour and attitudes. It is suggested not to under-
estimate the effect of the emergence of subgroups. Therefore, management is 
advised to establish group norms by clearly defining communication styles, dis-
cussion culture and mutual considerateness. By offering intercultural training to 
individual group members, cultural awareness and mutual understanding can be 
raised and trained. As a consequence, a better understanding of each other would 
lead to improved communication and task fulfilment and to increased motiva-
tion. Moreover, knowledge and information would not be seen as a means of 
power but as a means to build up collective and shared knowledge. 
When it comes to managing employee-co-worker relationships, management has 
to be aware of personality traits of individuals. For instance, some individuals 
are more extroverted or more assertive as compared to others. Management 
should be able to assess personality traits and to assign roles within a group or 
team according to the decisive characteristics of each personality. Together with 
collectively established team and group norms, a fit of individuals in team and 
group roles can be seen as a pathway to effective performance by satisfied and 
motivated individuals. 
</p>
<p>Five managerial implications to make group and team work in a hierarchi-
cal and bureaucratic structure work: creating a hybrid culture 
</p>
<p>The clue to successful group work and a future implementation of team work 
structures in the five UN organisations lies in the strategic use of hierarchy, bu-
reaucracy and in assigning the right management. The major challenge is to de-
sign a culture in which both hierarchy and team work can co-exist without turn-
ing the established organisational structure upside down, namely a hybrid cul-
ture. 
The following section lists and subsequently describes five normative practices 
that lead to a hybrid culture. 
</p>
<p>1. Analyse hierarchical (boundary activities) and bureaucratic (HRM) 
processes. 
2. Reduce processes to the minimum needed which still assures authority, 
accountability and credibility but gives the individual in charge responsibil-
ity. 
3. Span boundaries to enable team work. 
4. Design HRM practices supporting a hybrid culture 
5. Ensure the requisite skills of managers.

</p>
<p>The structures which hierarchy offers should be used for routine tasks which 
have to be executed on a regular basis and according to the defined rules and 
regulations. By using hierarchy and established bureaucracy to fulfil these tasks, 
their smooth and fast accomplishment can be guaranteed. However, it is advised 
to question existing hierarchies and bureaucracies in order to reduce redundancy 
and to guarantee clear lines of authority. This process is advised to be done in 
the light of boundary spanning activities and with regards to Human Resource 
Practices. Both will be explained as follows: 
For non-routine tasks it is suggested to span boundaries by opening the hierar-
chy to team structures. Team structures with dedicated roles and responsibilities 
do not necessarily conflict with the organisational premises of accountability 
and credibility. Yet, team structures may at the same time increase creativity, 
motivation, and subsequently performance. Research has shown that perform-
ance improves when the roles of individual team members are clearly defined 
and well understood (Gratton &amp; Erickson, 2007). Hence, individuals feel that 
they can work independently within the hierarchical structure while they have at 
the same time the possibility to cooperate across boundaries. 
A hybrid culture needs Human Resource practises which are team orientated 
rather than individually orientated. These practices provide collective decision 
making, shared leadership roles, collective discussion and solution of problems 
as well as collective performance measurement. The practices also foster train-
ing in skill related and collaborative behaviour. 
Human Resource Management practises should emphasise a selection of man-
agers who possess the skills and abilities to manage teams. Therefore, career de-
velopment should also consider skills which are especially important when it 
comes to lead and guide teams. Hence, managers should possess of political, 
economic and social skills. Effective teams and groups need managers who are 
both task- and relationship orientated. Moreover, these managers need to be able 
to switch between the two orientations during team and group work in order not 
to hinder the performance of such teams in the long run. Managers who possess 
these skills may become designers of successful teams and groups. By demon-
strating collaborative behaviour themselves, managers act as a role model for 
their subordinates and employees. By mentoring and coaching, managers also 
create a collaborating atmosphere which will positively enhance group and team 
work on an individual level. 
The five implications are summarised in the figure 12 below:

<p>6.4. Limitations and directions for future research 
The findings of this study should be viewed in light of several limitations. These 
limitations will be addressed in the following and suggestions for future research 
will be provided. 
Firstly, the generalisability of the results to the whole UN system is limited by 
sample restrictions. This study aggregated an Austrian perspective on multicul-
tural work in the United Nations Organisations. The reason for the restriction to 
an Austrian and German speaking sample originates in a trade off. To avoid a 
cross-cultural bias when conducting interviews in a foreign language, the deci-
sion was made to only interview native German speakers from Austria and from 
Germany. 
Therefore, an interesting avenue for future research would be to conduct inter-
views in different languages with different nationalities and cultures. 
Secondly, the study is limited to five individual Organisations of the United Na-
tions System. This reason for this restriction was twofold: on the one hand, one 
single researcher can not possibly cover the huge body of the United Nations 
System because of time and resource limitations. A selection had to be made and 
it paid attention to covering different types of units of the United Nations Sys-
tem, namely agencies, programmes and organisations. On the other hand, those 
units were chosen were the majority of German speaking staff could be identi-
fied. 
Future research should aim at investigating other units to get a broader view of 
the organisational context. 
Thirdly, this study is completely qualitative. The data collection method using 
semi-structured interviews is qualitative, the data analysis using constant com-
parison method is qualitative and the method being a case study is qualitative. 
Qualitative research is criticised as being biased by the researcher. Because of 
smaller sample size it is limited to a specific context which therefore has to be 
richly described. A quantitative research design may help to make results more 
generalisable in future research. 
Finally, the model presented covers a small slice of the vast domain of multicul-
tural work and intergovernmental organisations. A longitudinal study compris-
ing researchers from different research fields would help to widen the scope and 
broaden the understanding of multicultural work in this specific context.

"Contrary to groups, teams consist of

high task differentiation, and distrib-
uted expertise (Salas ct al., 1992;

1990). As a result, each team member

<p>other team members sequentially or

<p>Incorporating team context into research and practice concerning team 
effectiveness in multinational organizations still remains an ongoing challenge. 
This book aims at drawing the attention of researchers and practitioners 
towards the importance of various 'layers' of context on multinational teams 
and developing an empirically derived framework for multinational team 
functioning in business organisations. It shows how companies make use of 
these teams and how these teams contribute to competitive advantage. The 
study has been conducted in an Austrian, a German, and an American company . 
It reveals that if managed appropriately, these teams reduce the complexity of 
operations by facilitating the creation and transfer of explicit and tacit knowledge 
and by transferring appropriate dimensions of headquarter corporate culture 
between geographically dispersed business units.
