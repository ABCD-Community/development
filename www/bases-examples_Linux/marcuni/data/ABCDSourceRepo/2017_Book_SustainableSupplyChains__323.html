<p>  Preface: Abo ut This Book   
</p>
<p>    Objectives and Intended Audience 
</p>
<p> Who is this book for? In this Preface we give a quick introduction to the objectives 
</p>
<p>and intended audience of the book, the guiding principles we adopted in assembling 
</p>
<p>it, and its structure. In the Introduction (Chap.   1    , by Bouchery et al. 2017), we offer 
</p>
<p>some more broader perspectives on the current and future state of sustainability in 
</p>
<p>supply chains. 
</p>
<p> Sustainability is increasingly seen as a supply chain issue, not something that a 
</p>
<p>single fi rm can deal with effectively. Several authors have produced review articles 
</p>
<p>on sustainable supply chains, as well as special issues of journals, including Linton 
</p>
<p>et al. (2007), Srivastava (2007), and Seuring and M&uuml;ller (2008). Reviews on sustain-
</p>
<p>able operations, often including some discussion of supply chains, include Angell 
</p>
<p>and Klassen (1999), Kleindorfer et al. (2005), and Corbett and Klassen (2006). 
</p>
<p>Several books with similar titles have also appeared, each with their own focus. 
</p>
<p>Some are aimed primarily at practitioners, such as  Greening the Supply Chain , 
</p>
<p>edited by Sarkis (2006);  Sustainable Supply Chains: Models, Methods, and Public 
</p>
<p>Policy Implications , edited by Boone et al. (2012);  Sustainable Supply Chain 
</p>
<p>Management: Practical Ideas for Moving Towards Best Practice , edited by 
</p>
<p>Cetinkaya et al. (2010);  Green Supply Chains: An Action Manifesto  by Emmett and 
</p>
<p>Sood (2010); and  Green Supply Chain Management: Product Life Cycle Approach  
</p>
<p>by Wang and Gupta (2011). The book on  Green Logistics: Improving the 
</p>
<p>Environmental Sustainability of Logistics , edited by McKinnon et al. (2010), 
</p>
<p>focuses more in depth on logistics rather than on supply chains in the broader sense 
</p>
<p>of the word. 
</p>
<p> Each of these reviews and books has their place, but none of them were produced 
</p>
<p>with more technical graduate-level courses on sustainable supply chains in mind. 
</p>
<p>That is our objective, to provide a textbook that can be used in M.Sc. or relatively 
</p>
<p>technical M.B.A. courses (or advanced undergraduate courses) in this area. We have 
</p>
<p>observed an increase in the number of such courses being offered, but without a 
</p>
<p>corresponding increase in teaching materials. This book aims to draw on the latest </p>

</p>
<p>research to support courses on sustainable supply chains for graduate programs 
</p>
<p>such as business, management, industrial engineering, and industrial ecology. 
</p>
<p> Rather than write a mediocre book ourselves, we turned to leading experts to 
</p>
<p>provide overviews of their respective fi elds. We asked them to describe the current 
</p>
<p>state of affairs, and to identify future needs and trends, rather than presenting new 
</p>
<p>results not yet published elsewhere. Nevertheless, we anticipate that the book should 
</p>
<p>also be of interest for researchers in the broader sustainable supply chain space, 
</p>
<p>whether from the operations management and industrial engineering side or more 
</p>
<p>from the industrial ecology and life-cycle assessment side, as a vehicle to learn from 
</p>
<p>another community and to identify new research opportunities.  
</p>
<p>    Philosophy Behind This Book 
</p>
<p> In assembling this book, we followed a few key principles (discussed at more length 
</p>
<p>in the Introduction). First, we use the term &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; in a loose sense, meaning 
</p>
<p>that one considers the triple bottom line in making decisions, i.e., taking into account 
</p>
<p>economic, environmental, and social aspects. Second, we emphasize that sustain-
</p>
<p>ability is multidimensional and that measurement is key, which is why the book 
</p>
<p>starts with several chapters on measurement. Third, we recognize the need to 
</p>
<p>address a wide range of aspects of &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; in the book, but do not necessar-
</p>
<p>ily aim to cover them all in every chapter. Fourth, and most importantly, we decided 
</p>
<p>to let the experts who contributed these chapters speak: it is more important for 
</p>
<p>readers to be exposed to a wide view of experts than just to hear our opinions. As a 
</p>
<p>result, some topics may be covered in multiple chapters, while other topics are not 
</p>
<p>covered at all.  
</p>
<p>    Structure of This Book 
</p>
<p> The structure of the book is straightforward. Part I starts with several chapters on 
</p>
<p>measurement and reporting. Separate chapters provide introductions to LCA, car-
</p>
<p>bon footprinting, water footprinting, nonrenewable materials management, and 
</p>
<p>reporting. Part II covers core operational aspects of sustainable supply chains, with 
</p>
<p>separate chapters devoted to green logistics, green inventory management, green 
</p>
<p>facility location, operational implications of environmental regulation, responsible 
</p>
<p>purchasing, green technology choice, and principles of eco-design. Part III revolves 
</p>
<p>around issues related to business models and strategy in sustainable supply chains, 
</p>
<p>with chapters on the stock market value implications of environmental initiatives 
</p>
<p>and business implications of sustainability practices, moving from a product-based 
</p>
<p>to a service-based economy, and a strategic overview of closed-loop supply chains, 
</p>
<p>design of sustainable food supply chains, and managing risk and uncertainty in 
</p>
<p>sustainable supply chains. Part IV focuses more on the social dimension of 
</p>
<p>Preface: About This Book</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>vii
</p>
<p>sustainability, with chapters on how to improve social and environmental 
</p>
<p> performance in global supply chains, perspectives on social responsibility in supply 
</p>
<p>chains, and how to manage cross-sector partnerships with NGOs in sustainable sup-
</p>
<p>ply chains. Inevitably, some chapters could have been arranged differently, and they 
</p>
<p>can be read in any sequence. All chapters are also available from the publisher 
</p>
<p>separately.

<p>  Acknowledgments  
</p>
<p> We are deeply grateful to each and every author who contributed to this book, many 
</p>
<p>of whom are leading authorities in their fi elds and none of whom were lacking in 
</p>
<p>other opportunities. We worked closely with the authors, suggesting revisions here 
</p>
<p>and there to enhance consistency between the chapters; despite their busy sched-
</p>
<p>ules, the authors were very gracious and patient with our requests. Without them, 
</p>
<p>there would be no book. Naturally, it is diffi cult&mdash;no, impossible&mdash;to include in a 
</p>
<p>single book every aspect of sustainable supply chains or to invite all the leading 
</p>
<p>authorities in the fi eld. Unsurprisingly, we failed on both fronts, and the resulting 
</p>
<p>omission of some relevant topics and leading authorities can be chalked up to the 
</p>
<p>space restrictions and time pressures we faced. 
</p>
<p> Between the four of us, we have too many parents, spouses, partners, children, 
</p>
<p>colleagues, friends, and others to whom we are deeply indebted for their support 
</p>
<p>(voluntary or involuntary, knowing, or otherwise) to name them all individually. We 
</p>
<p>wish we could promise that with the completion of this book, we will have more 
</p>
<p>time for all of you, but we cannot rule out that something else will come along to 
</p>
<p>preoccupy us.  </p>

<p>1.1          Sustainable Supply Chains: What&rsquo;s New? 
</p>
<p> Are supply chains becoming more or less sustainable over time? The answer is not 
</p>
<p>obvious. In the 1960s, we became aware of the dangers inherent in various chemi-
</p>
<p>cals including those used in pesticides, specifi cally DDT. Some would point to 
</p>
<p>Rachel Carson&rsquo;s 1962 book  Silent Spring  as a defi ning moment in the history of the 
</p>
<p> environmental movement  , contributing to the creation of the environmental move-
</p>
<p>ment and the Environmental Protection Agency in the USA. In the 1970s, we started 
</p>
<p>to learn that seemingly innocent aerosols in spray cans were eating a hole in the 
</p>
<p>ozone layer, removing a crucial protection against being toasted and eventually 
</p>
<p>burned by the sun. Various regulatory and voluntary actions followed, and depletion 
</p>
<p>of the ozone layer seems to have slowed down recently. In the 1980s, we found out 
</p>
<p>that acid rain was killing our lakes and eating our  cities  . Various regulatory responses 
</p>
<p>have since helped to reduce emissions of chemicals leading to acidifi cation. During 
</p>
<p>the 1990s, we heard horror stories of how workers in sweatshops in China, Vietnam, 
</p>
<p>and elsewhere were treated. Firms such as Nike initially responded that they did not 
</p>
<p>own the factories, and hence it was not their problem, but by the 2000s, at least some 
</p>
<p>fi rms (including Nike) had completely changed their tone. Throughout these

</p>
<p>decades, it transpired increasingly clearly that anthropogenic  emissions   were likely 
</p>
<p>contributing to rising levels of  greenhouse gases   in the atmosphere, with a variety of 
</p>
<p>effects on sea level and climate. A plethora of regulatory and voluntary responses is 
</p>
<p>underway to mitigate climate change, with decidedly mixed results so far. 
</p>
<p> But how much of all this is new? Insecticides have been regulated in the USA as 
</p>
<p>far back as 1910, though what is now the UK already passed a rule in about 1236 AD 
</p>
<p>that &ldquo;forbade the addition of anything to the food supply which was &lsquo;not whole-
</p>
<p>some&rsquo;&rdquo; (Aspelin  2003 , Chap. 2: 10&ndash;11). The ozone layer was discovered in 1913, 
</p>
<p>and its properties and thickness were already increasingly measured during the sub-
</p>
<p>sequent decades (e.g., Solomon  1999 ). The link between acid rain and  atmospheric 
</p>
<p>pollution   was established in 1852, with the term &ldquo;acid rain&rdquo; appearing in 1872; 
</p>
<p>damaging effects of pollution had been observed even earlier (see, e.g., Cowling 
</p>
<p> 1982 ). Early anti-sweatshop movements gave rise to the Factory Act in the UK in 
</p>
<p>1833 (Nardinelli  1980 ) and more recently to the Fair Labor Standards Act in the 
</p>
<p>USA in 1938 (Samuel  2000 ). 
</p>
<p>  Climate change   is no different. Arrhenius ( 1896 ) already reported on the connec-
</p>
<p>tion between atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and global temperature, 
</p>
<p>predicting that a doubling of the  CO 2  concentration   would lead to a temperature 
</p>
<p>increase of 4.9&ndash;6.1 &deg;C (depending on the latitude). This estimate is remarkably 
</p>
<p>close to more recent ones by the IPCC, who report a range of predicted temperature 
</p>
<p>rises between 1.5&ndash;4.5 &deg;C (Houghton et al.  1995 ). Arrhenius was keenly aware of the 
</p>
<p>geological importance of his calculations, writing (p. 267) &ldquo;I should certainly not 
</p>
<p>have undertaken these tedious calculations if an extraordinary interest had not been 
</p>
<p>connected with them.&rdquo; His primary motivation, however, was explaining the Ice 
</p>
<p>Age, rather than predicting future global warming. 
</p>
<p> These timelines have a clear implication for any book on &ldquo;sustainable supply 
</p>
<p>chains&rdquo;: scientists of all kinds are undoubtedly already making observations and 
</p>
<p>constructing theories of environmental and social aspects that we are blissfully 
</p>
<p>unaware of today but that will come to haunt us in the decades to come. In other 
</p>
<p>words, there can be no such thing as a &ldquo;sustainable supply chain,&rdquo; as we do not and 
</p>
<p>cannot know today what will be critical elements of &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; tomorrow. 
</p>
<p> Even if we limit ourselves to the environmental and social factors that we are 
</p>
<p>already aware of, a truly &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; supply chain is diffi cult to envision. This is 
</p>
<p>certainly true when one adopts a strong sustainability perspective, which does not 
</p>
<p>allow manufactured capital to substitute for natural capital. Almost any supply 
</p>
<p>chain, at some level, converts natural capital into manufactured capital, rendering 
</p>
<p>them inherently unsustainable under that perspective. In the weak sustainability 
</p>
<p>view, it is acceptable to deplete natural resources, as long as there is a correspond-
</p>
<p>ing increase in manufactured capital. Deforestation is acceptable as long as 
</p>
<p> technological progress delivers substitutes for wood. Increasing  water pollution   is 
</p>
<p>acceptable as long as decontamination technology advances in parallel. In this 
</p>
<p>perspective, a supply chain could be sustainable if its &ldquo;net&rdquo; impact on people and 
</p>
<p>planet is neutral, still a tall order. As Pagell and Wu argue in Chap.   15    , sustain-
</p>
<p>ability in supply chains should be thought of in terms of trajectories, rather than 
</p>
<p>absolute states. 
</p>
<p>Y. Bouchery et al.</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-29791-0_15">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-29791-0_15</a></div>

<p>3
</p>
<p> Our quick historical sketches above underline that such trajectories can never 
</p>
<p>have a well-defi ned endpoint. Instead, a more sustainable supply chain is one that 
</p>
<p>is better at identifying current and future environmental and social impacts and 
</p>
<p>fi nding ways to mitigate those. That is the, admittedly very loose, defi nition we 
</p>
<p>use in this book for &ldquo;sustainable.&rdquo; We take no position on weak vs. strong 
</p>
<p> sustainability, on whether one should be more concerned about climate change, 
</p>
<p>water availability, or social impacts. We do take the position that for a fi rm to 
</p>
<p>thrive, it is increasingly imperative that it be aware of economic, environmental, 
</p>
<p>and social dimensions of the entire supply chain it belongs to and that it  proactively 
</p>
<p>monitor and manage those. 
</p>
<p> The arguments so far might point towards the need for a fi rm to engage with its 
</p>
<p>economic, environmental, and social impacts. But why would it need to do so for 
</p>
<p>the entire supply chain within which it operates? As fi rms become progressively 
</p>
<p>more tightly coupled in global supply chains, rather than being large vertically inte-
</p>
<p>grated monoliths, risks and opportunities associated with activities upstream or 
</p>
<p>downstream will increasingly impinge upon their own well-being. Referring to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;risks and opportunities associated with activities upstream or downstream&rdquo; clearly 
</p>
<p>signifi es an equally broad and loose defi nition of &ldquo;supply chains&rdquo;: we will not 
</p>
<p>attempt to draw a clear boundary of what we do and do not consider part of a supply 
</p>
<p>chain, but in this book, we do include not just  suppliers and customers   but also 
</p>
<p>consumers, society, employees, communities, NGO partners, and others who in one 
</p>
<p>way or another participate in the &ldquo;activities upstream or downstream.&rdquo; For many 
</p>
<p>fi rms, some of the main risks and opportunities do lie outside their own boundaries, 
</p>
<p>hence necessitating this broader supply chain perspective. 
</p>
<p> To summarize, this book should not be called &ldquo;Sustainable Supply Chains,&rdquo; but 
</p>
<p>rather something like &ldquo;Gradual but Never-Ending Paths Towards Less Unsustainable 
</p>
<p>Global Value Networks.&rdquo;  
</p>
<p>1.2     Sustainable Supply Chains: What&rsquo;s Really New? 
</p>
<p> Having argued that in some sense &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; is not new, one might still ask 
</p>
<p>what  is  new? Why assemble this book at this particular point in time? 
</p>
<p> First, the scientifi c understanding of many aspects of sustainability is advancing 
</p>
<p>faster than ever before. In the past, many  environmental and social issues   were 
</p>
<p>largely treated independently from one another, but we are increasingly understand-
</p>
<p>ing that climate change interacts heavily with health and poverty. The links between 
</p>
<p>energy, food, and water are sinking in. Climate change threatens biodiversity which 
</p>
<p>in turn endangers continuity of supply of various crops, putting already poor 
</p>
<p> constituencies at further risk, etc. 
</p>
<p> Second, the political landscape is evolving in parallel. While there is a wide 
</p>
<p>variation in regulation and enforcement across countries, and even across cities or 
</p>
<p>regions within countries, the global trend is undeniably towards more and more 
</p>
<p>comprehensive environmental and social regulation. 
</p>

</p>
<p> Third, the landscape within which business operates is undergoing similar evolu-
</p>
<p>tion. Firms no longer treat environmental concerns as single-issue one-off 
</p>
<p> distractions, but are increasingly taking a comprehensive approach to managing 
</p>
<p>their full spectrum of environmental and social (as well as economic) impacts. That 
</p>
<p>is triggered in part by the evolution in scientifi c understanding and political  agendas, 
</p>
<p>but presumably most of all by the maturing realization that, done judiciously, a 
</p>
<p>proactive approach to sustainability can go hand in hand with increased profi tability 
</p>
<p>(more on which below). This is the result of market forces, the changing regulatory 
</p>
<p>environment, employee engagement, investor action, and more. 
</p>
<p> Finally, and perhaps most importantly in terms of this book, we have noticed a 
</p>
<p>recent surge in the number of courses on &ldquo;sustainable supply chain management&rdquo; or 
</p>
<p>related topics, but a relative lack of corresponding teaching materials. While sus-
</p>
<p>tainability has been widely studied at the level of company strategy and extensive 
</p>
<p>pedagogical materials exist at that more strategic level, there is still a relative lack 
</p>
<p>of materials on sustainability with a supply chain management perspective. 
</p>
<p> Taken together, we hope that these observations jointly indicate that the time is 
</p>
<p>ripe for a book of this nature. At the same time, these observations point to some 
</p>
<p>principles that we adopted in assembling this book, outlined in the next section.  
</p>
<p>1.3     Principles Underlying This Book 
</p>
<p> Having established that neither &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; nor &ldquo;supply chains&rdquo; are necessarily 
</p>
<p>new in themselves, we made a number of deliberate choices in designing this book, 
</p>
<p>each of which we discuss in more detail below.
</p>
<p>    1.    There are economic reasons for fi rms to adopt a proactive approach to sustain-
</p>
<p>ability (but not every sustainability initiative is necessarily profi table).   
</p>
<p>   2.    Merely measuring environmental and social impacts is often already enough to 
</p>
<p>bring about improvements in performance.   
</p>
<p>   3.    Supply chain operations are key to boosting sustainability performance.   
</p>
<p>   4.    Sustainability is not a state, but (at best) a direction.   
</p>
<p>   5.    Sustainability involves engaging with a range of  stakeholders  , not limited to the 
</p>
<p>traditional supply chain partners.     
</p>
<p>1.3.1     Economic Drivers of Sustainability 
</p>
<p> There is clearly a strong ethical dimension to sustainability. However, in this book 
</p>
<p>we emphasize the economic side. Many studies seek to determine whether fi rms 
</p>
<p>that are more sustainable are also more profi table. That question, as stated, is prob-
</p>
<p>ably unanswerable, as &ldquo;more sustainable&rdquo; can mean too many different things, and 
</p>
<p>even for any specifi c dimension of sustainability the answer will depend on too 
</p>
<p>Y. Bouchery et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5
</p>
<p>many conditions, such as geography, industry,  market conditions  , timing, and more. 
</p>
<p>There are some meta-analyses of this literature that generally do point towards a 
</p>
<p>positive link between sustainability and  profi tability  ; see for instance Orlitzky et al. 
</p>
<p>( 2003 ) for a meta-analysis of the link between corporate social performance and 
</p>
<p>fi nancial outcomes and Horv&aacute;thov&aacute; ( 2010 ) for the link between  fi nancial and 
</p>
<p> environmental performance  . This link need not always be direct; for instance, in 
</p>
<p>Chap.   19    , Scholten and Fynes ( 2017 ) discuss how sustainability can lead to greater 
</p>
<p>resilience. Moreover, the fact that the weight of the evidence tilts towards a positive 
</p>
<p>link does not mean that every sustainability initiative will be profi table by every 
</p>
<p>metric. For instance, in Chap.   14    , Jacobs et al. ( 2017 ) report that the US stock 
</p>
<p> market responded negatively to fi rms&rsquo; announcements of GHG and especially non-
</p>
<p>GHG emissions reductions, though they also point out that those emissions reduc-
</p>
<p>tions may have other indirect benefi ts not immediately captured by the stock market 
</p>
<p>reaction. Their fi ndings should not be taken as implying that sustainability is not 
</p>
<p>profi table; they do highlight that practitioners should not naively assume that every 
</p>
<p>sustainability-related initiative will be immediately profi table or rewarded by the 
</p>
<p> stock market.   
</p>
<p> This discussion might suggest that becoming more sustainable is optional. 
</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is not: fi rms are facing increasing pressure to become more sustain-
</p>
<p>able and to take their supply chains with them. That pressure comes from  custom-
</p>
<p>ers  , both from individual consumers (especially in developed countries) and from 
</p>
<p>organizations in the B2B context. Regulations continue to target larger segments of 
</p>
<p>the supply chain and on more dimensions. Governments are moving more and more 
</p>
<p>to a cradle-to-grave (or even cradle-to-cradle) perspective in designing regulation, 
</p>
<p>which makes the supply chain the inevitable unit of analysis. In addition, non- 
</p>
<p>governmental organizations (NGOs) fi nd various ways to encourage or pressure 
</p>
<p>fi rms to adopt more sustainable behavior, whether related to labor practices, elimi-
</p>
<p>nating various ingredients in food, reducing emissions, or otherwise. Add to this 
</p>
<p>pressure from investors, banks, insurance companies, employees, and more, and it 
</p>
<p>is clear that sustainability is often an imperative more than a luxury.  
</p>
<p>1.3.2     What You Measure Is What You Get 
</p>
<p> There are good reasons to believe that the mere act of measuring something triggers 
</p>
<p>ways to improve it. The fact that Walmart, of all fi rms, was able to fi nd ways to 
</p>
<p>reduce both GHG emissions and costs by installing auxiliary power units in their 
</p>
<p>trucks once they started taking a close look at their carbon footprint is a prime 
</p>
<p>example of this. That is one reason why this book contains several chapters on mea-
</p>
<p>surement. Moreover, measurement is not at all straightforward and inherently 
</p>
<p>requires a supply chain perspective. A fi rm seeking to reduce its &ldquo;own&rdquo; emissions 
</p>
<p>faces two big challenges. First, it is practically impossible to unambiguously mea-
</p>
<p>sure or even closely estimate a fi rm&rsquo;s responsibility for the emissions associated 
</p>
<p>with a fi nal product or service. A typical product goes through numerous

</p>
<p> manufacturing and transportation activities  , often jointly operated by a number of 
</p>
<p>companies in a supply chain. Second, the direct emissions that a fi rm might abate 
</p>
<p>typically constitute a small part of the supply chain emissions. Matthews et al. 
</p>
<p>( 2008 ) report that across all industries, companies&rsquo; direct emissions average only 
</p>
<p>14 % of their supply chain emissions  prior to  use and disposal. Therefore, sustain-
</p>
<p>ability measurement should take a supply chain perspective, rather than limiting 
</p>
<p>itself to the fi rm&rsquo;s own emissions and impacts. 
</p>
<p> In Chap.   2    , Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 ) provide an introduction to life cycle 
</p>
<p>assessment, which can be thought of as the overarching framework for measurement 
</p>
<p>of environmental (and perhaps in future also social) impacts. Of all the environmen-
</p>
<p>tal impacts, those related to  climate change   currently receive the most attention. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, Chap.   3    , by Boukherroub et al. ( 2017 ), focuses on measurement of car-
</p>
<p>bon footprints specifi cally. Water is increasingly recognized as another key resource 
</p>
<p>that is under threat, due to overuse, climate change, and pollution. Although the term 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;water footprint&rdquo; insinuates a parallel with &ldquo;carbon footprint,&rdquo; the measurement 
</p>
<p>issues are in fact quite different, among others due to water not being time and space 
</p>
<p>invariant the way that GHG emissions are. Hoekstra ( 2017 ) delves deeper into this 
</p>
<p>in Chap.   4    . There are numerous other raw materials that can be sources of concern, 
</p>
<p>as outlined by Blass et al. ( 2017 ) in Chap.   5    . Finally, Bateman et al. ( 2017 ) link these 
</p>
<p>various measurement paradigms to reporting and disclosure programs in Chap.   6    . 
</p>
<p> This series of chapters highlights that measurement, although highly valuable, is 
</p>
<p>often not trivial. Challenges include the multiple dimensions of impacts that need to 
</p>
<p>be consolidated, the appropriate acknowledgment of how impacts differ across 
</p>
<p>space and time, the challenge of setting appropriate boundaries, how to deal with 
</p>
<p>variation and uncertainty, and more. Many of these questions are the topic of ongo-
</p>
<p>ing research and unresolved. Nevertheless, we believe that the most frequent 
</p>
<p>sustainability- related tasks which students will fi nd themselves confronted with 
</p>
<p>revolve around measurement.  
</p>
<p>1.3.3     Supply Chain Operations Are Key to Sustainability 
</p>
<p> One could argue that  th  ere are two broad domains within which one can strive for 
</p>
<p>more sustainable outcomes. One is consumer behavior: this can be getting consumers 
</p>
<p>to launder their clothes at lower temperatures and less frequently, or to consume less 
</p>
<p>goods and services in the fi rst place. That is largely outside the scope of this book. 
</p>
<p>The other domain is the supply chain leading up to the consumer. Here, we contend, 
</p>
<p>genuine improvements in sustainability outcomes ultimately require changes in the 
</p>
<p>supply chain&rsquo;s operations, broadly defi ned. Operations form the core of every orga-
</p>
<p>nization, whether in manufacturing, service, or nonprofi t industries. In the past few 
</p>
<p>decades, fi rms have experienced increasing globalization and a shifting focus to 
</p>
<p>competition among networks of fi rms. Due to these trends, the fi eld of supply chain 
</p>
<p>management has become an increasingly central domain within operations. This can 
</p>
<p>refer to greener logistics (Chap.   7     by Blanco and Sheffi   2017 ), inventory

<p>management (Chap.   8     by Marklund and Berling  2017 ), or facility location (Chap.   9     
</p>
<p>by Vel&aacute;zquez-Mart&iacute;nez and Fransoo  2017 ). The specifi c challenges and opportunities 
</p>
<p>vary by industry, as Bloemhof and Soysal ( 2017 , Chap.   18    ) discuss in the context of 
</p>
<p>the food supply chain. Operations can involve adopting greener technologies 
</p>
<p>(Ovchinnikov  2017 , Chap.   12    ), rethinking product design (Luttropp  2017 , Chap.   13    ), 
</p>
<p>or developing closed-loop supply chains (Abbey and Guide  2017 , Chap.   17    ). 
</p>
<p> Although inevitably these topics are discussed in separate chapters, one of the 
</p>
<p>challenges in practice is that they are all interrelated. For example, a product or 
</p>
<p>component design that serves the same functionality with less material use will not 
</p>
<p>just help the manufacturer due to a cut down in the material costs, but it will also 
</p>
<p>decrease all transport and storage related requirements downstream in the supply 
</p>
<p>chain and hence also the related costs and environmental burden (such as emissions 
</p>
<p>due to transport) in the supply chain. Similarly, developing technologies that 
</p>
<p>increase fuel effi ciency of vehicles or use renewable energy sources benefi ts also 
</p>
<p>supply chain actors through decreased fuel usage. 
</p>
<p> Sometimes these operational changes are driven by changes in business model, 
</p>
<p>by shifting the emphasis from products to services, as outlined in Bellos and 
</p>
<p>Ferguson ( 2017 , Chap.   16    ). In other instances, they result from regulation. Huang 
</p>
<p>and Atasu ( 2017 , Chap.   10    ) point out that even well-intended regulations can have 
</p>
<p>adverse consequences, as the devil is often in the detail; an immediate consequence 
</p>
<p>is that regulators also need a deeper understanding of the operations of the fi rms 
</p>
<p>they are trying to regulate and that fi rms need a more nuanced understanding of the 
</p>
<p>exact effect certain regulations will  h  ave on their supply chains.  
</p>
<p>1.3.4     Sustainability as a Direction, Not a State 
</p>
<p> As noted above, a supply chain is unlikely to ever be &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; (even by the 
</p>
<p>weak defi nition). It is nevertheless a worthwhile  goal   to constantly strive for, as 
</p>
<p>some fi rms are aggressively doing. Dole&rsquo;s operating subsidiary Standard Fruit de 
</p>
<p>Costa Rica will develop a carbon-neutral supply chain for bananas and pineapples 
</p>
<p>from Costa Rica to North America and Europe 1  in keeping with Costa Rica&rsquo;s goal 
</p>
<p>to become the fi rst carbon-neutral country by 2030. Finsbury Green in Australia 
</p>
<p>sells carbon-neutral paper under its FreshZero brand, offsetting all supply chain 
</p>
<p>emissions. Tesco aims to be a zero-carbon business by 2050. Brazil&rsquo;s Natura 
</p>
<p>Cosm&eacute;ticos offsets not only its own emissions but those of its entire supply chain, 
</p>
<p>which is all the more noteworthy given that the supply chain accounts for 95 % of 
</p>
<p>those emissions. As of 2015, Apple does not allow suppliers to use bonded labor. 
</p>
<p>Other examples abound. In order to determine whether a fi rm or supply chain is 
</p>
<p>making progress towards that goal, one has to have the right measures in place, 
</p>
<p>hence our focus on measurement at the beginning of this book.

</p>
<p> Recognizing that sustainability is a path, not a state, it is helpful to analyze the 
</p>
<p>stages that fi rms go through on that path. Pagell and Wu ( 2017 , Chap.   15    ) outline 
</p>
<p>three main trajectories that fi rms can follow and point out that choices fi rms make 
</p>
<p>today determine the options available to them in future. This notion of path depen-
</p>
<p>dency, while well known in itself, is often neglected in the literature on sustainable 
</p>
<p>supply chains. As a fi rm embarks on a path towards becoming more sustainable, 
</p>
<p>that also changes the way they interact with their suppliers, as van Weele and van 
</p>
<p>Tubergen ( 2017 , Chap.   11    ) illustrate in more detail.  
</p>
<p>1.3.5     Sustainability Involves Wider Range of  Stakeholders   
</p>
<p> An inescapable consequence of the rising expectations fi rms face related to sustain-
</p>
<p>ability is the expanding set of stakeholders they have to interact with and the more 
</p>
<p>complex ways in which they have to interact with each of them. Keeping sharehold-
</p>
<p>ers happy has long been a prime objective, but that now requires far more extensive 
</p>
<p>reporting than ever before. This trend is further encouraged by an emerging set of 
</p>
<p>NGOs who are, depending on one&rsquo;s perspective, either representing investors by 
</p>
<p>asking these wide-ranging questions, or using investors to exert pressure on fi rms to 
</p>
<p>expand their reporting. Customers, employees, and regulators are expecting more 
</p>
<p>from fi rms. At the same time, fi rms are expected to be aware of environmental and 
</p>
<p>social issues faced by communities around the world that are (positively or nega-
</p>
<p>tively) affected by their supply chains, whether directly or through local regulators 
</p>
<p>and NGOs. Lee and Rammohan ( 2017 , Chap.   20    ) explain the importance of sensing 
</p>
<p>and responding to social and environmental problems in global supply chains. 
</p>
<p>Sodhi and Tang ( 2017 , Chap.   21    ) ask what social responsibility fi rms bear and argue 
</p>
<p>that fi rms can and should take the utilities of a wide range of stakeholders into 
</p>
<p>account when making decisions. Sometimes fi rms choose to partner proactively 
</p>
<p>with NGOs to address environmental or social problems in their supply chains; 
</p>
<p>Balaisyte et al. ( 2017 , Chap.   22    ) discuss factors that contribute to the success of 
</p>
<p>such partnerships.   
</p>
<p>1.4     The Future of Sustainable Supply Chains 
</p>
<p> We started this chapter by arguing that, in many ways, the themes currently being 
</p>
<p>discussed under the heading &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; are not new. Therefore, one easy pre-
</p>
<p>diction about what the future holds for sustainable supply chains is &ldquo;more of the 
</p>
<p>same.&rdquo; At the same time, it is certain that the future will bring new challenges and 
</p>
<p>opportunities, some of which may already be visible today even if not yet recog-
</p>
<p>nized as major issues. Here, we fi rst elaborate on what &ldquo;more of the same&rdquo; will look 
</p>
<p>like and then speculate about what else may be around the corner.

</p>
<p>1.4.1     More of the Same 
</p>
<p> We are convinced that &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; will continue to become a larger part of the 
</p>
<p>conversation between supply chain partners worldwide. These conversations will 
</p>
<p>be increasingly wide ranging, moving from focusing on a single issue (such as car-
</p>
<p>bon, child labor, or fi re safety) to a more systematic multidimensional view. The 
</p>
<p>emphasis may shift over time from one set of issues to another, depending on 
</p>
<p>(unpredictable) world events, but we would be surprised if the overall emphasis on 
</p>
<p>sustainability did not increase. 
</p>
<p> As a result of this, and of the constant expansion of resources dedicated to mea-
</p>
<p>suring and reporting sustainability performance, this will become an increasingly 
</p>
<p>quantitative and standardized affair, ever more tightly integrated within fi rms&rsquo; deci-
</p>
<p>sion processes. This will enable fi rms to make more analytical, proactive, and long- 
</p>
<p>term decisions related to sustainability, rather than (often) having to respond to &ldquo;the 
</p>
<p>issue of the day.&rdquo; Accounting as an organized profession emerged in the nineteenth 
</p>
<p>century, and hence fi nancial accounting has a head start of at least 100 years over 
</p>
<p>sustainability accounting; one could use the advances that have occurred in  fi nan-
</p>
<p>cial   accounting since the 1900s as a guideline for predicting what might happen 
</p>
<p>with sustainability accounting and reporting over the coming 100 years. Despite 
</p>
<p>those advances in fi nancial accounting, the profession still faces challenges that are 
</p>
<p>relevant for operations and supply chains. 
</p>
<p> One is that the data that are generated for fi nancial accounting purposes are often 
</p>
<p>unsuitable for operational decision-making, but nevertheless widely used for pre-
</p>
<p>cisely that as there is no other easy substitute available. One can anticipate the same 
</p>
<p>happening with sustainability-related information: data on social impacts that is 
</p>
<p>collected for the fi rm&rsquo;s annual sustainability report may not be suitable to support 
</p>
<p>day-to-day decisions on how to operate a supply chain, but unfortunately it is likely 
</p>
<p>that the errors that currently exist in how fi nancial accounting information is used 
</p>
<p>will be replicated in sustainability accounting. 
</p>
<p> A second challenge is that fi nancial accounting data are still subject to various 
</p>
<p>degrees of manipulation, ranging from mild and innocent to outright fraud. As sus-
</p>
<p>tainability reporting gains importance, the stakes become higher, and hence the 
</p>
<p>likelihood of biases and actual fraud increases. The fact that sustainability-related 
</p>
<p>information may be even harder to audit than fi nancial information further exacer-
</p>
<p>bates this.  
</p>
<p>1.4.2     What&rsquo;s Around the Corner 
</p>
<p> Climate change may be the most-discussed environmental (and social) issue facing 
</p>
<p>the world today. However, some might argue that availability of freshwater may 
</p>
<p>overtake climate change as the dominant topic, either because society tires of cli-
</p>
<p>mate change or because it genuinely becomes a more imminent threat. Even if, as 
</p>
<p>1 Sustainable Supply Chains: Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10
</p>
<p>seems very unlikely today, renewable energy grows fast enough to prevent danger-
</p>
<p>ous climate change, will we discover negative unintended consequences of photo-
</p>
<p>voltaic panels, solar farms, and wind turbines? Some are already known, and as 
</p>
<p>adoption becomes more widespread, others will inevitable crop up. 
</p>
<p> As our historical analogies at the beginning of this chapter point out, there are 
</p>
<p>undoubtedly chemicals being used today, or even new materials being introduced 
</p>
<p>today, that, at some point in future, will turn out to have been mistakes. The contin-
</p>
<p>ued opposition to genetically modifi ed organisms (GMOs), especially in Europe, 
</p>
<p>suggest that many fear they will fall into this category.  Nanomaterials   have great 
</p>
<p>promise, but their properties are far from fully understood. 
</p>
<p> Improving working and living conditions for employees and local communities 
</p>
<p>in faraway countries upstream in a global supply chain seems very noble 
</p>
<p>(and should be encouraged). Is there a risk that fi rms, in doing so, contribute 
</p>
<p>to creating a population that is more educated and less despondent, more prone to 
</p>
<p>travel or migrate around the globe, and therefore less accepting of local govern-
</p>
<p>ments, democratic or otherwise? Will fi rms that fi nd ways to reduce poverty end 
</p>
<p>up contributing to increasing inequality and hence fomenting social problems that 
</p>
<p>do not currently exist? 
</p>
<p> None of these questions have easy answers. The fact that there may be unin-
</p>
<p>tended negative consequences of well-intended actions today does not mean that we 
</p>
<p>should not take those well-intended actions, quite the contrary. But it does mean 
</p>
<p>that we should constantly be vigilant, looking for what new issues may emerge, 
</p>
<p>recognizing that more sustainable supply chains can be a force for good but that 
</p>
<p>they will never be truly sustainable. We hope that this book will contribute to edu-
</p>
<p>cating future supply chain managers and business leaders about many of the issues 
</p>
<p>they will face today and tomorrow and equip them with the tools and frameworks 
</p>
<p>that will help them on this journey.

<p>Introduction to Life Cycle Assessment
</p>
<p>Jeroen Guin&eacute;e and Reinout Heijungs
</p>
<p>This chapter1 gives an overview of the mainstream method of life cycle assessment 
(LCA) on the basis of the generally accepted principles as laid down in International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) series of Standards on LCA. The first part is 
devoted to the key questions addressed by LCA and sketches the historical develop-
ment towards that method. The second part provides an overview of the LCA 
method itself, while the third part discusses some examples of LCA applications. 
Finally, the fourth part discusses some of the future challenges to LCA including 
life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) and streamlined LCA techniques.
</p>
<p>2.1  LCA: What Does It Address and How Has It Developed?
</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s society is highly consumption based. Through advertisements and market-
ing campaigns, we are stimulated on a daily basis to consume products, services and, 
if possible, more and more. Products and services are the key selling items of our 
economic system. At the same time we are facing huge sustainability challenges with 
respect to, e.g. climate change, land use change, water shortages, toxic pollution and 
resource scarcity. Products and services are key concepts in addressing these sustain-
ability challenges. Refrain from any consumption is not an option, so we have to 
strive for a more sustainable production and consumption pattern. Environmental

</p>
<p>policy today focuses at the transition to such sustainable production and consump-
tion patterns. This is taking place in various ways and at various levels.
</p>
<p>For this purpose we often will have to compare the sustainability of products 
against each other. We then first need a few definitions: what is sustainability, what 
are comparable products and what exactly are products?
</p>
<p>&bull; Sustainability has at least three dimensions: the economic, the environmental 
and the social dimensions; LCA focuses on the environmental dimensions only.
</p>
<p>&bull; Products fulfil functions or services. We buy a car, motor or bike to travel from 
A to B; we eat and drink to satisfy our nutritional needs; etc. We generally have 
different alternative products to fulfil these functions.
</p>
<p>&bull; We are not so much looking into products as such but rather at a system of eco-
nomic or industrial processes needed for the functioning of that product. Here 
the term &ldquo;product system&rdquo; (or even better &ldquo;function system&rdquo;) enters the arena. 
A product system refers to the entire life cycle of a product, from extraction of 
natural resources to final waste management of the disposed product, from 
&ldquo; cradle to grave&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t just look at driving a car, but we include the total 
system of industrial/economic processes needed for constructing all components 
of the car, the maintenance of the car, the use of the car including the total life 
cycle of the fuels needed to drive the car, the roads needed, etc. until the final 
disposal of the car at the end of its life which may include recycling.
</p>
<p>Knowledge of the environmental impacts of such product systems is indispens-
able if we are aiming for improving the environmental performance of these 
 systems. We preferably need numbers for all relevant environmental impacts of 
product systems, from the cradle to the grave (whole life cycle), in order to find best 
solutions for their improvement without shifting impacts to other fields or to other 
phases of the life cycle (trade-offs). One of the assessment methods widely used for 
this is environmental life cycle assessment, abbreviated LCA.
</p>
<p>Do we really need a potentially complex method as LCA? Isn&rsquo;t driving an  electric 
vehicle simply better than driving a gasoline-based vehicle? If it was as simple as 
that, we wouldn&rsquo;t need LCA but unfortunately the reality is much more complex if 
we take a systems approach mapping the whole life cycle and all potentially relevant 
environmental impacts. Electric vehicles need a lot of batteries to store electricity, 
and these batteries need a lot of scarce resources that may potentially leak to the 
environment as hazardous substances, but depending on the source of electricity, 
they may perform better in the use phase compared to gasoline-based cars. Only by 
analysing the full life cycle of these two functionally equivalent &ldquo;car driving sys-
tems&rdquo;, we can determine which one is environmentally better performing. But even 
then, it&rsquo;s often not possible to simply conclude that one option is better than the other 
as it may still depend on consumer&rsquo;s behaviour or on the source of electricity (e.g. 
renewables or fossil fuels) as in the case of the electric car (Hawkins et al. 2012). The 
same ratio can be applied to comparing plastic and carton disposable mugs with 
porcelain mugs for drinking coffee, disposable diapers versus cotton diapers, bio-
fuel- versus fossil fuel-based electricity systems, etc.

<p>2.1.1  LCA in a Nutshell
</p>
<p>LCA offers a method for quantitatively compiling and evaluating the inputs, out-
puts and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its 
life cycle (ISO 1996), and its results may be used to support decision-making in 
this area. LCA refers to a method, but it also refers to the result of this method. 
In this chapter, we will mainly focus on the method that is used to obtain an 
&ldquo;LCA result&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>LCA has made a long way, and it is still changing. But since a decade or so, there 
is a broadly accepted set of principles that can claim to be the present-day LCA 
framework based on a series of standards and technical reports issued by the ISO, the 
14040 series (ISO 1996, 1998, 2000, 2000a, b, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2012, 2012a, b). 
This series consists of the documents listed in Table 2.1.
</p>
<p>The standards are organized into the different phases of an LCA study. These are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Goal and scope definition
&bull; Inventory analysis
&bull; Life cycle impact assessment
&bull; Life cycle interpretation
</p>
<p>The relations between these phases have been illustrated in a figure, and this 
figure has become a sort of logo of LCA (Fig. 2.1).

<p>2.1.2  History of LCA
</p>
<p>As mentioned, LCA has made a long way. This section discusses the historical 
development of LCA in terms of its past and present. The text is largely based on 
Guin&eacute;e et al. (2011).
</p>
<p>2.1.2.1  The Past of LCA (1970&ndash;2000)
</p>
<p>Firstly, we will briefly discuss and evaluate LCA as developed and applied in the 
past while distinguishing two periods: (1) 1970&ndash;1990 and (2) 1990&ndash;2000.
</p>
<p>1970&ndash;1990: Decades of Conception
</p>
<p>The first studies that are now recognized as (partial) LCAs date from the late 
1960s and early 1970s, a period in which environmental issues like resource and 
energy efficiency, pollution control and solid waste became issues of broad pub-
lic concern (Assies 1992). One of the first (unfortunately unpublished) studies

</p>
<p>quantifying the resource requirements, emission loadings and waste flows of 
 different beverage containers was conducted by Midwest Research Institute 
(MRI) for the Coca Cola Company in 1969. Together with several follow-ups, 
this marked the beginning of the development of LCA as we know it today. After 
a period of diminishing public interest in LCA and a number of unpublished 
 studies, there has been rapidly growing interest in the subject from the early 
1980s on. In 1984 the Swiss published a report (BUS 1984) that presented a com-
prehensive list of the data needed for LCA studies, thus catalysing a broader 
application of LCA.
</p>
<p>The period 1970&ndash;1990 comprised the decades of conception of LCA with widely 
diverging approaches, terminologies and results. There was a clear lack of interna-
tional scientific discussion and exchange platforms for LCA. During the 1970s and 
the 1980s, LCAs were performed using different methods and without a common 
theoretical framework. LCA was repeatedly applied by firms to substantiate market 
claims. The obtained results differed greatly, even when the objects of the study 
were the same, which prevented LCA from becoming a more generally accepted 
and applied analytical tool (Guin&eacute;e et al. 1993).
</p>
<p>1990&ndash;2000: Decade of Standardization
</p>
<p>The 1990s saw a remarkable growth of scientific and coordination activities world-
wide. Also the first scientific journal papers started to appear in the Journal of 
Cleaner Production, in Resources, Conservation and Recycling, in the International 
Journal of LCA, in Environmental Science &amp; Technology, in the Journal of Industrial 
Ecology and in other journals.
</p>
<p>The Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) started 
 playing a leading and coordinating role in bringing LCA practitioners, users and 
scientists together to collaborate on the continuous improvement and harmonization 
of LCA framework, terminology and methodology. Next to SETAC, the ISO has 
been involved in LCA since 1994. Whereas SETAC working groups focused at 
development and harmonization of methods, ISO adopted the formal task of stan-
dardization of methods and procedures.
</p>
<p>The period of 1990&ndash;2000 can therefore be characterized as a period of conver-
gence through SETAC&rsquo;s coordination and ISO&rsquo;s standardization activities, provid-
ing a standardized framework and terminology, and platform for debate and 
harmonization of LCA methods. In other words, the 1990s was a decade of 
 standardization. During this period, LCA also became part of policy documents and 
legislation. The main focus was on packaging legislation.
</p>
<p>Although this decade is mainly one of convergence, it is also the stage of 
 scientific scrutiny, research into the foundations of LCA, and exploring the connec-
tions with existing disciplines. For instance, we observe sprouting ideas on 
 consequential LCA and related allocation methods (Weidema 2000, Ekvall 2000) 
marking the transition to the present decade of LCA.

</p>
<p>2.1.2.2  2000&ndash;Present: The Era of Elaboration
</p>
<p>The first decade of the twenty-first century has shown an ever increasing attention 
to LCA. In 2002, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the 
Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) launched 
an International Life Cycle Partnership, known as the Life Cycle Initiative (http://
www.lifecycleinitiative.org/). In 2005 the European Platform on Life Cycle 
Assessment (http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) was established to promote the 
 availability, exchange and use of quality-assured life cycle data, methods and 
 studies for reliable decision support in (EU) public policy and in business. In the 
USA, the US Environmental Protection Agency started promoting the use of LCA 
(http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/lca/lca.html), and also US environmental policy got 
increasingly life cycle based all over the world (e.g. http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/
BILLS- 110hr6enr/pdf/BILLS-110hr6enr.pdf).
</p>
<p>In this same period, several life cycle-based carbon footprint standards have 
been, or are being, established (http://www.lcacenter.org/LCA9/special/Carbon- 
footprint.html). Although the footprint concept is broader than LCA (it, for instance, 
includes organization footprints and national footprints as well), a rich literature 
has spawned around the product environmental footprint (PEF; http://ec.europa.eu/
environment/eussd/smgp/product_footprint.htm), which basically is an LCA, and 
in addition carbon footprints (CF), which are LCAs focusing on greenhouse gases 
only. CF is now often associated with consumer products, and in an increasing 
number of cases, we find the CF score on the packaging or the label. The introduc-
tion of carbon footprint standards for supporting policies and (bioenergy) 
performance- based regulation raised some severe problems, which have often not 
yet been solved adequately (Matthews et al. 2008). Life cycle-based carbon foot-
print results need to be robust and &ldquo;lawsuit-proof&rdquo;. This implies that the freedom of 
methodological choices for the handling of, e.g., biogenic carbon balances and allo-
cation should be reduced to an absolute minimum and that uncertainties are dealt 
with appropriately, which is unfortunately not yet common practice. Another issue 
is the limited scope of carbon footprints towards climate change impacts neglecting 
the possible trade-off to other impact. Finally, we reiterate that the term footprint 
not necessarily refers to a functional unit-based LCA; see also Hoekstra&rsquo;s (2017), 
Chap. 4 in this volume.
</p>
<p>The period 2000&ndash;present can be characterized as the decade of elaboration. 
While the demand on LCA increases, the period is characterized by a divergence in 
methods again. As ISO never aimed to standardize LCA methods in detail and as 
there is no common agreement on how to interpret some of the ISO requirements, 
diverging approaches have been developed with respect to system boundaries and 
allocation methods, dynamic LCA, spatially differentiated LCA, environmental 
input&ndash;output-based LCA (EIO-LCA) and hybrid LCA, which combines the 
strengths of classical LCA and environmentally extended input&ndash;output analysis 
(EE-IOA). On top of this, various life cycle costing (LCC; cf. Hunkeler et al. 2008) 
and social life cycle assessment (S-LCA; cf. Beno&icirc;t and Mazijn 2009) approaches 
have been proposed and/or developed.

</p>
<p>2.2  Overview of LCA
</p>
<p>Typically, LCA starts by defining goal and scope, then proceeds to the inventory 
analysis, then optionally continues to impact assessment and ends with the 
 interpretation. However, as indicated in Fig. 2.1, an LCA study is a highly iterative 
process, so that the LCA practitioner may need to go back to goal and scope after 
the preliminary inventory work, to move back from impact assessment to inventory 
analysis, to have a look at the interpretation in an early stage, etc.
</p>
<p>Below, we will discuss the main idea and content of the four phases distinguished 
in Fig. 2.1 in separate subsections. All quotations are taken from the ISO docu-
ments, unless otherwise indicated.
</p>
<p>2.2.1  Goal and Scope Definition
</p>
<p>There is no explicit ISO definition of the first phase of LCA. However, it  obviously 
centres around formulating the question and stating the context of answering this 
question. In the goal and scope definition, no data is collected and no results are 
calculated. Rather, it is a place where the plan of the LCA study is defined as 
clearly and unambiguously as possible. Likewise, in an LCA report, it should help 
the reader to quickly find out the precise question addressed and main principles 
chosen.
</p>
<p>The goal of the LCA should deal with the following topics:
</p>
<p>&bull; The intended application
&bull; The reasons for carrying out the study
&bull; The intended audience
&bull; Whether the results are to be used in comparative assertions disclosed to the 
</p>
<p>public
</p>
<p>The choices made here have an influence on the rest of the LCA procedure. For 
instance, depending on the intended audience, a critical review may be needed, and 
it may be important that an external expert takes this task.
</p>
<p>In the scope definition, a number of major choices are made. First of all, the 
product system or systems to be studied and the function the system delivers (or in 
case of a comparative LCA, the functions the systems deliver). For instance, one 
might be interested in the product systems&rsquo; incandescent light bulb versus the LED 
bulb, with the function of lighting a room.
</p>
<p>An important aspect of the scope definition is the functional unit. It is obviously 
pointless to compare an incandescent bulb with a LED bulb: the life spans and per-
formances differ considerably, and the function is not having a light bulb but having 
light of a certain quality. The functional unit expresses the function of the products 
and thereby offers a way to equalize differences in performance. A functional unit 
for analysing lighting systems could thus better be phrased in terms of the function, 
</p>
<p>2 Introduction to Life Cycle Assessment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22
</p>
<p>for instance &ldquo;lighting a standard room of 15 m2 with 1000 lm for 1 h&rdquo;. As LCA 
employs mathematically a linear calculation rule, the results will scale by choosing 
a numerically different functional unit (say, &ldquo;lighting a standard room of 20 m2 with 
800 lm for 3 h&rdquo;), but the alternatives considered will scale up or down consistently, 
so this will not affect the conclusions. A consequence is, however, that LCA cannot 
tell if a product is &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; or &ldquo;environmentally friendly&rdquo;; LCA can only indi-
cate if product X is &ldquo;more sustainable&rdquo; or &ldquo;more environmentally friendly&rdquo; than 
product Y or that the use phase is the &ldquo;least sustainable&rdquo; or &ldquo;least environmentally 
friendly&rdquo; part of the life cycle for product Z.
</p>
<p>The scope definition further sets the main outline on a number of subjects that are 
discussed and further refined in more detail in the later phases. These include, 
amongst others:
</p>
<p>&bull; System boundaries
&bull; Impact categories
&bull; Treatment of uncertainty
</p>
<p>The ISO standard and some other texts at places suggest that these topics are 
implemented in detail in the scope definition. This is wrong: the goal and scope defi-
nition is not concerned with collecting data or calculating results, so no concrete 
details on such topics can be specified at this phase.
</p>
<p>2.2.2  Inventory Analysis
</p>
<p>ISO defines inventory analysis (LCI) as the &ldquo;phase of life cycle assessment involv-
ing the compilation and quantification of inputs and outputs for a product through-
out its life cycle&rdquo;. It will be clear that quantification is an important aspect here, and 
numbers, in terms of data and calculations, are of central concern in the inventory 
analysis.
</p>
<p>The LCI is built up on the basis of the unit process. A unit process is the 
&ldquo;smallest element considered in the life cycle inventory analysis for which input 
and output data are quantified&rdquo;. Examples of unit process are coal mining, steel 
production, refining of oil, production of furniture, use of a TV, recycling of 
wastepaper and transport by lorry. Each of these processes is described in quanti-
tative terms as having inputs and outputs. As a matter of fact, a unit process is in 
LCA considered as a black box that converts a bundle of inputs into a bundle of 
outputs. Inputs come in several types: products (including components, materials 
and services), waste for treatment and natural resources (including fossils, ores, 
biotic resources and land). Outputs come in several types as well: again products 
(including components, materials and services), waste for treatment and residuals 
to the environment (including pollutants to air, water and soil, waste heat and 
noise); see Fig. 2.2.
</p>
<p>Unit processes form the building blocks of an LCA. This is because products are 
not harmful for the environment as such, except for the processes involved in 
</p>
<p>J. Guin&eacute;e and R. Heijungs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23
</p>
<p> products. Producing, using and disposing products create the burden to the environ-
ment. Therefore, these processes assume a central position in LCA.
</p>
<p>The essential feature of LCA in which it distinguishes itself from the analysis of 
an industrial or agricultural process is that it connects different unit process into a 
system. A flow diagram is a graphical representation of the system of connected 
unit processes. Figure 2.3 shows a fragment of such a flow diagram.
</p>
<p>As we can see, some unit processes are connected with one another in simple 
upstream&ndash;downstream connections, e.g. TV production is upstream connected to 
semiconductor production. But there are also more complicated connections, e.g. 
electricity linking to different parts of the system and recycling feeding back to 
production. Flow diagrams are in fact huge webs of interconnected unit processes. 
In the present era of digital databases, LCA studies can easily comprise several 
thousands of unit processes.
</p>
<p>LCA is primarily a quantitative model. In the LCI, all unit processes included 
have to be quantified. This means that we have to specify the sizes of the inflows 
and outflows, per unit process. As an example, let us take the unit process of alu-
minium production.

<p>An aluminium plant may specify their technology in terms of inputs and outputs 
by stating input requirements (e.g. 2 kg aluminium oxide and 20 kWh electricity per 
kg produced aluminium) and emissions (e.g. 200 g CO2 per kg produced  aluminium). 
We must translate this into our template for unit processes; see Table 2.2.
</p>
<p>For each of the unit processes included, quantitative data should be collected. 
Moreover, in order to be able to process the data and perform the calculations auto-
matically, a clear and unambiguous representation is needed. This implies, amongst 
others, harmonization of nomenclature (e.g. not using &ldquo;carbon dioxide&rdquo; for one unit 
process and &ldquo;CO2&rdquo; for another one) and harmonization of units (e.g. not mixing up 
kg and lbs).
</p>
<p>In Table 2.2, the unit process data is given per unit of output, here per kg of alu-
minium. In an LCA, we must next find out how much we need. For instance, the 
product may need 3 kg of aluminium, not 1 kg. The basic assumption of the LCA 
model is that technologies are linear. This means that we can scale the data of a unit 
process by a simple multiplication. In the example, 3 kg of aluminium would require 
6 kg of aluminium oxide and 60 kWh of electricity, while it would release 600 g of 
CO2. The assumption of linear technology is an important restriction of LCA; yet it 
is an important step in making the calculation and data collection feasible.
</p>
<p>In scaling the unit processes, the web-like nature of the system quickly creates 
complications, as everything depends upon everything. The calculation of the scal-
ing factors, and with that of the emissions to and extraction from the environment, 
is greatly simplified by considering the problem as a system of linear equations: one 
unknown (the scaling factor) for every unit process and one equation (a balance) for 
every flow. Thus, solutions may be obtained by matrix algebra. The details of this 
are not discussed here; see (Heijungs and Suh 2002) for a detailed exposition.
</p>
<p>The approach mentioned above may fail in a number of cases. We mention two 
complications:
</p>
<p>&bull; For some products, upstream production processes or downstream disposal pro-
cess may be difficult to quantify.
</p>
<p>&bull; For some unit processes, the balance equations become impossible due to the 
fact that these processes produce not just one product but several products.
</p>
<p>The first issue can be solved by a procedure known as cut-off, the second one by 
allocation.
</p>
<p>Cut-off is a solution to the problem that the system is theoretically infinitely 
large. To produce a TV, we need machines, and these machines are produced by 
machines, and these machines in turn need machines, etc. But of course we have an

</p>
<p>intuitive idea that some very distant upstream processes will be quite unimportant. 
This means that we will cut off certain inputs: although we know that something is 
needed, and we sometimes even know how much is needed, we do not go into the 
trouble of specifying how these inputs are produced. It turns out to be difficult to 
specify reliable criteria when cut-off is allowed or to estimate how large the error is 
when a cut-off is made. Criteria on the basis of negligible contribution to mass or 
cost (e.g. smaller than 1 %) often work pretty well but occasionally have been 
shown to yield large errors. Alternatively, estimates of missing parts by means of 
similar processes (e.g. estimating production of a freezer by production of a fridge) 
or by economic input&ndash;output tables may be helpful. Another approach is to do a 
difference analysis: in comparing a CRT and an LCD TV, we may leave out the 
broadcasting processes.
</p>
<p>The second problem has given rise to one of the biggest controversies in LCA 
theory. The problem can be stated simply: if a transportation process needs gaso-
line, the upstream unit process is a refinery that produced not only gasoline but also 
diesel, kerosene, heavy oils and some more. The direct impacts (from pollutants like 
CO2), but also the flows to and from other processes that may lead to impacts (e.g. 
from oil drilling), may be argued not to be attributed to gasoline only but in need to 
be distributed over gasoline, diesel and all other coproducts. This is hardly  contested, 
but the debate focuses on how to do this. To make it more concrete: how much of 
the CO2 from a refinery is allocated to the gasoline? Different schools have provided 
different arguments, and none of these have been completely compelling so far. 
Some solutions lead to strange results, other solutions may be very difficult to carry 
out (e.g. for lack of data or appropriate software), and still others are rejected by a 
large number experts. To complicate the issue, the problem does not only occur in 
unit processes that produce several coproducts but also in unit processes that treat 
more than one type of waste or that recycle a waste into a good. It is even not agreed 
if the multi-output case, the multi-input case and the recycling case must be treated 
in the same way or not.
</p>
<p>Within ISO, a preference order for solving the multifunctionality problem has 
been designed. It distinguishes several solutions (dividing the unit process into two 
or more subprocesses, expanding the system to include the additional functions, 
partitioning on the basis of a physical parameter, partitioning on the basis of an 
economic parameter) separated by clauses like &ldquo;wherever possible&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;where &hellip; cannot be established&rdquo;. This stepwise procedure is a clear comprise, and 
in practice it leaves so much freedom that LCA studies that are according to the ISO 
standard can give conflicting results. One peculiarity deserves to be mentioned: 
besides the ISO-based &ldquo;expanding the system to include the additional functions&rdquo;, 
we often see a method that is best described as &ldquo;subtracting the avoided impacts 
from additional functions&rdquo; but that is more commonly known as the substitution 
method or the avoided burdens method. For instance, when a waste treatment activ-
ity co-produces electricity, the emissions from the regular way of producing the 
same amount of electricity are subtracted. This method has similarities with that of 
system expansion, but of course it is not identical. Many LCA studies employing 
the substitution method claim to be ISO compliant, even though strictly speaking 
</p>
<p>2 Introduction to Life Cycle Assessment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26
</p>
<p>ISO 14044 does not mention this method, let alone recommend it. That does not 
necessarily mean that these studies are incorrect, of course. Compliance with ISO is 
not a sufficient quality guarantee but also not a necessary one.
</p>
<p>After appropriate cut-off and allocation steps, the final inventory results can be 
calculated. Typically, this is a table with the quantified inputs from and outputs to 
the environment, for each of the alternative systems considered, expressed in rela-
tion to the functional unit. With the present-day software and databases, this inven-
tory table may be 1000 lines long or more. It contains not only the familiar pollutants 
and resources, such as CO2, NOx and crude oil, but also more exotic items, such as 
1-pentanol, cyprodinil and dolomite. Typically, these so-called elementary flows 
are aggregated over the entire system, so that the CO2 number is the life cycle emis-
sion of CO2.
</p>
<p>2.2.3  Impact Assessment
</p>
<p>Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), or impact assessment in short, is the &ldquo;phase 
of life cycle assessment aimed at understanding and evaluating the magnitude and 
significance of the potential environmental impacts for a product system throughout 
the life cycle of the product&rdquo;. Its motivation comes from two observations:
</p>
<p>&bull; The final result of the inventory analysis, the inventory table, is too long (e.g. 
1000 different items) to handle.
</p>
<p>&bull; The inventory table contains many items that require expert knowledge (such as 
2-methyl-2-butene) to understand in terms of importance.
</p>
<p>Impact assessment, and in particular the characterization step, solves both issues: 
it &ldquo;involves the conversion of LCI results to common units and the aggregation of 
the converted results within the same impact category&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>While the unit process is the central element of the inventory analysis, the central 
element in impact assessment is the impact category. ISO defines it as a &ldquo;class rep-
resenting environmental issues of concern to which life cycle inventory analysis 
results may be assigned&rdquo;. Perhaps more helpful are some examples: climate change, 
toxicity and depletion of fossil energy carriers.
</p>
<p>As climate change (often used interchangeable with global warming) is a 
 well- known issue, we will illustrate the main ideas of impact assessment with this 
case. The inventory table contains a number of greenhouse gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, 
etc. These are known to contribute all to the phenomenon of climate change. Climate 
change involves long sequence of causal mechanisms: emissions of greenhouse 
gases lead to changes in the composition of the atmosphere, which lead to a change 
in the radiation balance, which in turn leads to a change in the temperature distribu-
tion, which leads to changes in climate, which leads to changes in ecosystems and 
human activities, etc. The further we proceed in this causal chain, the more uncer-
tain and speculative our knowledge becomes. While quite some scientific evidence 
is available with respect to the composition of the atmosphere, the impacts on

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27
</p>
<p> biodiversity are debated. Many of these later impacts are even conditional on our 
future activities, including future emission scenarios and mitigating actions. To be 
able to quantitatively model the emissions of different greenhouse gases into an 
impact indicator for climate change, we must do several things.
</p>
<p>First, we must choose a certain point in the causal mechanism. This can be at the 
front end (change in radiation balance), at the back end (change of biodiversity) or 
somewhere in between (change in temperature). In LCA, two main schools have 
emerged:
</p>
<p>&bull; Those that focus on the front end, the so-called midpoint approach.
&bull; Those that focus on the back end, the so-called end-point approach.
</p>
<p>The midpoint approach has the advantage that it includes fewer debatable 
assumptions and less-established facts; the end-point approach has the advantage 
that it provides more intuitive metrics (like loss of life years instead of kg CO2 
equivalent). Regardless of the choice between midpoint and end point, the indicator 
chosen is referred to as the impact category indicator or category indicator in short.
</p>
<p>Second, a way must be found to convert the emission data into the chosen impact 
indicator. Scientists in chemistry, meteorology, ecology, etc. have developed model 
fragments to estimate the atmospheric lifetimes of greenhouse gases, their effect on 
the radiation balance and the formation of clouds, the effects of temperature on the 
distribution of species, etc. These fragments have been combined by workgroups 
from the UN-based Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) into quanti-
tative models of the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Part of this are the global 
warming potentials (GWPs), which are quantitative measures of the strength of differ-
ent greenhouse gases. Many midpoint LCIA methods apply GWPs for climate change. 
We will illustrate their usage below. For now, it suffices to mention that GWPs pro-
vide one example of a set of characterization factors and that the IPCC model from 
which they are derived is an example of a characterization model. Note, by the way, 
that IPCC has not developed this model as a characterization model for LCIA but that 
the LCA community has adopted this model as such and its derived GWPs as charac-
terization factors. Also note that the characterization model itself is not used by LCA 
practitioners; only the characterization factors that have been derived from it as a one-
time exercise are used. Characterization factors are often tabulated in LCA guide-
books and are implemented in many LCA software packages, while the characterization 
models often require supercomputers and expert knowledge.
</p>
<p>In fact, there is one element before one can select a category indicator and a 
characterization model with associated characterization factors. It is the selection of 
impact categories to be addressed. Some LCA studies concentrate on just one 
impact category. For instance, the carbon footprint (of a product, not of a company 
or country) is a form of LCA that addresses just climate change at the midpoint level 
through GWPs. (Some chapters in this book go into more depth on a single impact 
category: see Chap. 3 by Boukherroub et al. (2017) for more on carbon footprinting, 
Chap. 4 by Hoekstra (2017) for more on water footprinting and Chap. 5 by Blass 
et al. (2017) for more on depletion of material resources.) At the other extreme, 
some LCA studies incorporate 15 or more impact categories. For consistency

</p>
<p> reasons, the choice of impact categories is often made on the basis of a  recommended 
impact assessment guidebook or its implementation in software. Thus, in practice 
one often sees LCA studies reporting the use of &ldquo;IMPACT2002+&rdquo;, &ldquo;TRACI&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;CML-IA&rdquo;, &ldquo;ReCiPe&rdquo;, &ldquo;ILCD&rdquo;, etc. All these methods comprise a recommended 
set of impact categories with a category indicator and set of characterization factors. 
ISO does not specify any choice in these matters. Table 2.3 gives an overview of 
some often-used impact categories and category indicators. We see that the column 
with end-point indicators contains many times the same term (e.g. &ldquo;loss of life 
years&rdquo;). This suggests that impact categories can be aggregated into fewer end-point 
indicators than midpoint indicators.
</p>
<p>As a concrete example of how characterization works, let us study a fragment of a 
hypothetical inventory table, containing the following information: emission of CO2 
100 kg, emission of CH4 1 kg and emission of SO2 1 kg. Characterizing greenhouse 
gases with GWPs requires a table with GWPs. In such a table, one can find that the 
GWP of CO2 is 1 (by definition) and that the GWP of CH4 is 25 (kg CO2 equivalent/
kg CH4). SO2 has no GWP; it is assumed not to contribute to climate change. 
Characterization now proceeds in the case of climate change by calculating

<p>For the more general case, this can be written as
</p>
<p> 
GW GWP m
</p>
<p>s
</p>
<p>s s
= &times;&sum;
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>where GW is the global warming score, s the substance (the different greenhouse 
gases), GWPs the GWP of substance s and ms the emitted amount of substance 
s in kg. This may be further generalized as
</p>
<p> 
I CF m
</p>
<p>c
</p>
<p>s
</p>
<p>c s s
= &times;&sum; ,
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>where c codes for the impact category, Ic represents the indicator result for category 
c and CFc,s is the characterization that links substance s to impact category c. This 
formula is the operational formula for characterization. With a table of characteriza-
tion factors specified, it makes clear:
</p>
<p>&bull; That LCIA builds on the results of LCI (as is clear from the term ms)
&bull; That characterization converts the results of LCI into a common metric (as is 
</p>
<p>clear from the multiplication by CF)
&bull; That characterization aggregates the converted LCI results (as is clear from the 
</p>
<p>summation symbol)
</p>
<p>The results from characterization are a list of numbers, for instance, a score for 
climate change, a score for toxicity, etc. ISO refers to such numbers as &ldquo;category 
indicator results&rdquo;, but most LCA practitioners prefer names like &ldquo;score&rdquo;, sometimes 
expanded with the name of the impact (like in &ldquo;toxicity score&rdquo;). The complete list is 
known by names like &ldquo;LCIA profile&rdquo;, &ldquo;characterization table&rdquo;, etc.
</p>
<p>An optional next step is normalization referring to calculating &ldquo;the magnitude of 
the category indicator results relative to some reference information&rdquo;. It is an optional 
step for ISO, and indeed, many LCIA studies stop at the characterization. The refer-
ence information is in most cases that total impact in a certain region in a certain time 
period, e.g. in the country of decision in 1 year. Normalization is done &ldquo;to understand 
better the relative magnitude for each indicator result&rdquo;. Without normalization, the 
indicator results are in quite different units, e.g. kg CO2 equivalent for climate change 
and MJ primary energy for fossil energy depletion. To put these results in perspec-
tive, the normalization expresses them as a share of the total impact size in the region. 
Arbitrary differences due to a choice of units disappear, and it becomes clear to 
which impact category a product contributes relatively much. The units of the nor-
malize indicator results are equal; nevertheless such numbers cannot meaningfully 
be added because the severity of the different impact categories has not yet been 
accounted for. This can be done in the weighting step; see below. Normalization 
fulfils several functions: it provides insight into the meaning of the impact indicator 
results, it helps to check for errors, and it prepares for a possible weighting step.
</p>
<p>2 Introduction to Life Cycle Assessment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30
</p>
<p>Weighting is a final step of the impact assessment phase. Weighting, like charac-
terization, converts and aggregates, but while characterization does so for the LCI 
results, weighting starts with the characterization (or normalization) results. 
Typically, weighting factors are applied, either to the characterization indicator 
results or to their normalized version. The weighting factors themselves are sup-
posed to reflect value judgements, such as social and political priorities. Weighting 
typically produces one final number, by means of
</p>
<p> 
W WF I
</p>
<p>c
</p>
<p>c c
= &times;&sum;
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>where Ic again symbolizes the impact score (or normalized impact score) for impact 
category c, WFc the weighting factor for this impact category and W the weighted 
result. Well-known examples of such weighted results are the eco-indicator and the 
ELU (environmental load unit).
</p>
<p>2.2.4  Interpretation
</p>
<p>ISO defines the interpretation as the &ldquo;phase of life cycle assessment in which the 
findings of either the inventory analysis or the impact assessment, or both, are eval-
uated in relation to the defined goal and scope in order to reach conclusions and 
recommendations&rdquo;. Several elements are mentioned by ISO:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of significant issues
&bull; An evaluation that considers completeness, sensitivity and consistency checks
&bull; Conclusions, limitations and recommendations
&bull; Appropriateness of the definitions of the system functions, the functional unit 
</p>
<p>and system boundary
&bull; Limitations identified by the data quality assessment and the sensitivity 
</p>
<p>analysis
</p>
<p>The text of ISO on interpretation is very concise, and no details are given on 
procedures and techniques to be employed. The same applies to most guidebooks 
on LCA. They mention carrying out an uncertainty analysis but give no clear guid-
ance on how this should be done.
</p>
<p>In another context, we have introduced the distinction between procedural and 
numerical approaches (Heijungs and Kleijn 2001):
</p>
<p>&bull; Procedural approaches include all types of analyses that deal with the data and 
results in relation to other sources of information, like expert judgements, reports 
on similar products, intuition, reputation of data suppliers and so on.
</p>
<p>&bull; Numerical approaches include those approaches that somehow deal with the data 
that is used during the calculations, without reference to those other sources of 
information, but as algorithms that use and process the data in different ways, so 
</p>
<p>J. Guin&eacute;e and R. Heijungs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>31
</p>
<p>as to produce different types of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; data reduction that provide an indication 
of reliability, key issues, discernibility, robustness and so on.
</p>
<p>This distinction helps to understand some important roles of interpretation. On 
the one hand, it is about comparing the data and results with previous findings and to 
put the results in the context of decision-making and limitations. On the other hand, 
it is devoted to a systematic analysis with the help of statistical and other decision-
analytic techniques. The latter type may be incorporated in software, and indeed, an 
increasing number of software packages contain options for running Monte Carlo 
analysis, doing sensitivity analysis, carrying out statistical significance tests, etc. For 
instance, in the CMLCA software, we have implemented, amongst others:
</p>
<p>&bull; Contribution analysis
&bull; Comparative analysis
&bull; Uncertainty analysis
&bull; Perturbation analysis
&bull; Key issue analysis
&bull; Discernibility analysis
</p>
<p>The iterative nature of the ISO framework (Fig. 2.1) shows up in this context. 
Whenever the uncertainties are too high, we may go back to collect better data. 
Whenever sensitivity analysis shows that some decisions are crucial, we may go 
back and do a more refined analysis. In this way, the interpretation helps to prepare 
for a balanced decision but also helps to improve the LCA.
</p>
<p>The development of methods in this area is booming (see Henriksson et al. 2013; 
Henriksson et al. 2015), but current practice is quite meagre, unfortunately. We still 
see many LCA studies without uncertainty or sensitivity analysis, even though 
methods and software increasingly facilitate this. There is of course a psychological 
argument that a contractor pays for finding out something, not for increasing the 
doubt. And as many LCA practitioners spend several months on collecting data, it 
is never a nice thing to waste this effort in a last-minute uncertainty analysis. But 
decision-making obviously means also taking into account the limits of knowledge. 
Moreover, as discussed before, a proper analysis of uncertainties and sensitivities 
helps to prioritize the steps earlier on in the framework: collecting data, setting 
boundaries and making choices.
</p>
<p>2.2.5  LCA in Practice
</p>
<p>In the text above, the emphasis has been on the generally accepted practice. This is 
a mix of the ISO standards and a not precisely defined set of guidebooks (e.g. Wenzel 
et al. 1997; Guin&eacute;e et al. 2002; Baumann and Tillman 2004; ILCD 2010; Curran 
2012; Kl&ouml;pffer and Grahl 2014). All these texts interpret, add, refine or modify the 
ISO standards. As has been indicated at a few places, the practice in LCA is 
 sometimes different from what the ISO standards prescribe. There are  differences in 
</p>
<p>2 Introduction to Life Cycle Assessment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>32
</p>
<p>terminology (e.g. one seldom sees the term intermediate products), in method 
(cf. the frequent use of the substitution method), in quality control (judged by 
 frequent absence of uncertainty analyses), etc.
</p>
<p>There are also de facto additional standards, dictated by the use of software (for 
an overview, see http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ResourceDirectory/toolList.vm) and 
databases (for an overview, see http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ResourceDirectory/
databaseList.vm). Many software packages for LCA have built-in options for 
impact assessment and uncertainty analysis, but nearly always in a restricted form, 
allowing some variants and prohibiting other variants. LCI databases are often con-
structed with predefined allocation methods and cut-off rules, so the user cannot 
choose otherwise and cannot carry out sensitivity analyses.
</p>
<p>2.3  Examples of LCA Applications
</p>
<p>LCA has been applied to a wide range of products and services. Until the late 1990s, 
bibliographies of LCA case studies performed were kept up to date (Grotz and 
Rubik 1997) on a continuous basis. Using Internet search machines results in a list 
of hundreds of LCA case studies documented in scientific papers or reports. Even 
more studies have been made for company-internal purposes, without publication in 
the scientific literature or on the web. LCA has been applied to simple products as 
shopping bags and packaging to more complex products such as mobile phones, 
PCs, cars and buildings. Studies may involve both an environmental comparison 
between existing products but also the development of new products (ecodesign). 
LCA has also been applied to services such as LCAs on hazardous waste site 
cleanup options, on waste management strategies and on different modes of freight 
transport (road, rail, water). As in the case of product LCAs, it is the function pro-
vided which is the core object of these service LCAs, but in this case the function is 
cleaning up a hazardous waste site, waste management or freight transport.
</p>
<p>The results of these case studies were often in line with general expectations, but 
there were also numerous counter-intuitive results. We randomly provide a selec-
tion of examples of the latter below.

<p>Fargione et al. (2008) stirred the biofuel debate by introducing the concept of 
&ldquo;biofuel carbon debt&rdquo;. The increasing demand for biofuels was initially increasing 
the production of biofuels from food crops such as corn, sugarcane, soybeans and 
palms. As a result, land in undisturbed ecosystems, especially in the Americas and 
Southeast Asia, was being converted to biofuel production as well as to crop pro-
duction (indirect land use change) when existing agricultural land was diverted to 
biofuel production (direct land use change). This land clearing releases huge 
amounts of CO2 as a result of burning or microbial decomposition of organic carbon 
stored in plant biomass and soils over a long time. Fargione et al. (2008) called the 
amount of CO2 released during the first 50 years of this process the &ldquo;carbon debt&rdquo; 
of land conversion. Over time, biofuels can afterwards repay this carbon debt if 
their production and combustion have less net GHG emissions compared to the life

<p>cycle emissions of the fossil fuels they displace. Their conclusion was that &ldquo;con-
verting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop&ndash;based 
biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a &lsquo;biofuel carbon 
debt&rsquo; by releasing 17&ndash;420 times more CO2 than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) 
reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. In contrast, 
biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on degraded and aban-
doned agricultural lands planted with perennials incur little or no carbon debt and 
can offer immediate and sustained GHG advantages&rdquo;. As policies throughout the 
world were increasingly promoting biofuels, this publication significantly influ-
enced reconsidering these policies.

<p>Bovea et al. (2010) compared the environmental life cycle performance of differ-
ent alternatives for the management of municipal solid. They analysed and evalu-
ated 24 different waste management scenarios. They concluded that &ldquo;fuel consumed 
during the collection, transport and waste sorting stages makes a contribution to the 
impact in all the categories that were analyzed, since there is not any avoided envi-
ronmental burden attributable to those processes&rdquo;. Moreover they conclude that 
&ldquo;recycling allows the pollution burden to be avoided for all impact categories, since 
it avoids the consumption of virgin material according to the substitution rate of 1:1; 
the contribution made by landfilling depends on whether it is carried out with or 
without energy recovery [&hellip;]&rdquo;. This study shows the dependency of results of meth-
odological choices such as the choice of allocation approach, which is particularly 
a problem in waste management studies (see also Ekvall et al. 2007).
</p>
<p>Hawkins et al. (2012) developed a very comprehensive and transparent LCA 
study comparing the life cycle environmental performance of conventional and 
electric vehicles. They found that &ldquo;EVs powered by the present European electricity 
mix offer a 10&ndash;24 % decrease in global warming results relative to conventional 
diesel or gasoline vehicles assuming lifetimes of 150,000 km. However, EVs exhibit 
the potential for significant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, 
freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, largely emanating from the 
vehicle supply chain. Results are sensitive to assumptions regarding electricity 
source, use phase energy consumption, vehicle lifetime, and battery replacement 
schedules&rdquo;. For EVs production impacts thus become more important, while for 
conventional cars the use phase is by far the most important phase. The environ-
mental performance of the EV can be improved by extending the lifetime of the EV, 
reducing the impacts of the EV production supply chain and by wider adoption of 
cleaner electricity sources.

<p>Gregory et al. (2013) evaluated and compared the environmental impact (focus-
ing on climate change) of five hand-drying systems: hands-under dryers, high-speed 
hands-under dryers, high-speed hands-in dryers, cotton roll towels and paper tow-
els. They also developed a method for incorporating uncertainty in the comparison 
of these hand-drying systems to understand the statistical robustness of the differ-
ence between the environmental impacts of the five hand-drying systems. They 
conclude &ldquo;with a high degree of confidence that the high-speed dryers have a lower 
impact than paper towels and cotton roll towels&rdquo;.

</p>
<p>van der Giesen et al. (2014) recently published an LCA study focusing on global 
warming impacts on a subject that receives increasing interest as part of the discus-
sion on the transition towards renewable energy sources: using CO2 as a resource to 
produce sustainable liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Producing these fuels by only using 
solar energy labels them as solar fuels. Today, new technologies for energy produc-
tion are often claimed to be &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; before they have been developed properly 
and/or subjected to any kind of sustainability assessment. Therefore, van der Giesen 
et al. (2014) performed a quantitative LCA &ldquo;to investigate some of the claims made 
in this discussion&rdquo;. They concluded &ldquo;that producing liquid hydrocarbon fuels 
 starting from CO2 by using existing technologies requires much more energy than 
existing fuels. An improvement in life cycle CO2 emissions is only found when 
solar energy and atmospheric CO2 are used. Producing fuels from CO2 is a very 
long- term niche at best, not the panacea suggested in the recent public discourse&rdquo;.

<p>2.4  Developments in and Challenges to LCA
</p>
<p>LCA is an active research area in terms of methodology as well as in practical 
aspects. Methodology developers are working hard on further improving different 
parts of the LCA method while also putting efforts in keeping the methods practi-
cally feasible. We here briefly discuss a subjective selection of ongoing develop-
ments and challenges that LCA is facing:
</p>
<p> 1. Development of consequential LCA
 2. Broadening LCA to LCSA
 3. Dealing with uncertainty in LCA
 4. Streamlining LCA and LCA for ecodesign
 5. Standardization of LCA methods beyond ISO
</p>
<p>2.4.1  Development of Consequential LCA
</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the present century, consequential LCA has significantly 
grown in terms of the number of case study applications (Zamagni et al. 2012; Guin&eacute;e 
and Heijungs 2011). Consequential LCA is a modelling approach that aims to 
describe the consequences of a decision and often models various scenarios to exam-
ine possible consequences. Consequential LCAs include unit processes in the prod-
uct system to the extent that they are expected to change as a consequence of a change 
in the demand for the product (Weidema et al. 2009). Attributional&mdash;as opposed to 
consequential&mdash;LCA aims to describe the environmentally relevant physical flows to 
and from a life cycle and its subsystems as they are, were or are expected to be. 
According to Schmidt (2010) and Weidema (2003), the core differences between 
CLCA and attributional LCA (ALCA) are that (1) consequential LCA includes the 
</p>
<p>J. Guin&eacute;e and R. Heijungs</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>35
</p>
<p>suppliers actually affected by a change in demand instead of averages as in ALCA 
and (2) co-product allocation is avoided by system expansion instead of applying 
allocation factors. This change is modelled not over time but as a comparison of the 
situation with and without a specific demand; various product- related future scenar-
ios are actually modelled. Future scenarios imply forecasting of future technologies, 
affluence and consumer behaviour and thus include large uncertainties, which 
increase as the term of the forecast becomes longer and the scope of the change 
becomes larger. Such uncertainties are inherent in modelling the future and thus also 
apply to an ALCA of a future system (Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs 2011). However, due to 
the higher ambition of modelling how the world will look like, consequential LCA 
studies may have much bigger challenges in terms of data demand and models.
</p>
<p>The modelling principles of ALCA and CLCA are the same; what distinguishes 
the two modes of LCA is the choice of the processes to be included in the system 
(Zamagni et al. 2012). Although the differences seem small, the application of the 
two modes to one case study (which can actually not be done, because they basi-
cally address different questions) may give significantly different results, not only 
between CLCA and ALCA but also between different (scenario) assumptions 
within CLCA (see Schmidt 2010). Bearing in mind that ALCA and CLCA can 
result in potentially significant differences, Plevin et al. (2014a) recently argued 
that &ldquo;using ALCA to estimate climate-change mitigation benefits misleads policy- 
makers&rdquo; basically claiming that CLCA is conceptually superior to ALCA for sup-
porting robust decision-making. Plevin et al. received a lot of criticism (Anex and 
Lifset 2014; Brand&atilde;o et al. 2014; Dale and Kim 2014; Hertwich 2014; Plevin et al. 
2014b; Suh and Yang 2014; Plevin et al. 2014c), but the debate has not been 
cleared yet, if ever.
</p>
<p>2.4.2  Broadening LCA to Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment
</p>
<p>As disclosed in Sect. 2.1.2, environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) has devel-
oped fast over the last three decades. LCA developed from merely energy analysis 
to a comprehensive environmental burden analysis in the 1970s; full-fledged life 
cycle impact assessment and life cycle costing (LCC) models were introduced in the 
1980s and 1990s, and&mdash;amongst many other things&mdash;social LCA (S-LCA) and par-
ticularly consequential LCA gained ground in the first decade of the twenty-first 
century. With these latter developments, LCA broadened itself from a merely envi-
ronmental LCA into a more comprehensive life cycle sustainability analysis 
(LCSA). Based on definitions by Kl&ouml;pffer and Renner (2007; see also Kl&ouml;pffer 
2008) and Guin&eacute;e et al. (2011), we can distinguish three dimensions along which 
LCSA expanded or may expand when compared to environmental LCA:
</p>
<p> 1. Broadening the scope of current LCA from mainly environmental impacts only 
to covering all three dimensions of sustainability (people, planet and prosperity): 
LCSA = LCA + LCC + S-LCA.
</p>
<p>2 Introduction to Life Cycle Assessment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>36
</p>
<p> 2. Broadening the scope from predominantly product-related questions (product 
level) to questions related to sector (sector level) or even economy-wide levels 
(economy level).
</p>
<p> 3. Deepening current LCA methods to also include other than just technological 
relations, e.g. physical relations (including limitations in available resources and 
land), economic and behavioural relations (including rebound effects), etc.
</p>
<p>LCSA is still a rather new area of research and needs a lot of further research, 
particularly in designing practical methods. Nevertheless, several articles on LCSA 
have already been published in international journals, professional sections have been 
established such as the ISIE-LCSA section (http://www.is4ie.org/sections#LCSA), 
and LCSA has become a subject area in, for example, the International Journal of 
LCA (http://www.springer.com/environment/journal/11367).
</p>
<p>2.4.3  Dealing with Uncertainty in LCA
</p>
<p>A huge challenge for environmental LCA, and even huger for LCSA and CLCA, is 
how to deal with the many uncertainties related to LCA and LCA results. Until 
today, this issue was largely underexposed by methodology developers, practitio-
ners, databases and software.
</p>
<p>LCA is an integral method, bringing together data on many processes, data and 
models on impacts, assumptions on functional unit, system boundaries, allocation, 
etc. All of these data and (impact) models already bring many uncertainties with 
them, and in LCA we lump these uncertainties. LCA practitioners are usually already 
happy when they get the main part of the data they need. Getting a grip on the uncer-
tainties related to these data and to the models they apply is generally a bridge too 
far, let alone to also quantify the influence on the results of different methodological 
choices and different assumptions. However, work on this is progressing as shown 
above in the chapter on Interpretation. Recently, Henriksson et al. (2015) even 
showed that statistically testing a hypothesis&mdash;requiring a predefined null hypothesis 
and quantification of uncertainties&mdash;is practically feasible (and, as a matter of fact, 
indispensable) for LCA-based product carbon footprints and provides more robust 
decision support. Main challenges now are to harmonize methods developed, to con-
sistently elaborate and apply them over all sources of uncertainties throughout the 
whole LCA method and to collect the relevant input uncertainty data. Particularly the 
latter requires substantial efforts and can only be achieved by reporting LCA data 
comprehensively, transparently and in a publicly accessible way.
</p>
<p>2.4.4  Simplifying and Streamlining LCA
</p>
<p>Improving the LCA method is one thing, but keeping it practically feasible for 
users is another. Options for simplifying and streamlining LCA have been reviewed 
by Zamagni et al. (2008) and Pesonen and Horn (2013). They distinguished three

<p>37
</p>
<p>different types of simplified approaches: qualitative (e.g. qualitative matrices, 
checklists, expert panels), semi-quantitative (e.g. partly quantified matrices) and 
quantitative (simplified LCA). For all three categories practical methods have been 
developed. There is unfortunately no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution for streamlining 
and simplification, and streamlined methods generally don&rsquo;t produce conclusions 
similar to those reached through full LCAs (Hunt et al. 1998). Zamagni et al. 
(2008) conclude that &ldquo;the choice of the most suitable simplified method, or combi-
nation of simplified methods, depends on the type of results users are looking for&rdquo;. 
For a study &ldquo;aiming at supporting a choice between several alternatives and a study 
aimed at identifying critical aspects and suggesting mitigation strategies different 
methods may be suitable. In the first case, it is much more important to have quan-
titative data than in the second case. In fact, in the first case the lack of a quantita-
tive dimension would hinder the comparison and make it difficult to differentiate 
between products. On the other hand, problems could arise when in quantitative 
LCA, aspects that are difficult to quantify are handled qualitatively, because this 
qualitative information is often overlooked&rdquo; (Hoschorner and Finnveden 2003; 
Zamagni et al. 2008). For this first type of question, the challenge is to simplified 
LCA models based on detailed LCA experiences for specific product (categories). 
The EU 5th framework project OMNIITOX developed models calculating charac-
terization factors for assessing the potential toxic impacts of chemicals within the 
framework of LCA. The project developed two interrelated models in order to be 
able to provide LCA impact assessment characterization factors for toxic releases 
for as broad a range of chemicals as possible: (1) a base model representing a state-
of-the-art multimedia model and (2) a simple model derived from the base model 
using statistical tools. Most simplified LCA models up till now have been devel-
oped in a rather &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; way, independent from detailed LCAs. The experiences 
in OMNIITOX (Birkved and Heijungs 2011) and reported by Huijbregts et al. 
(2006) seem useful to copy to simplified LCA models based on detailed LCAs for 
specific products. However, in some cases simplification may be much simpler 
than this. In the 1990s LCAs were performed on light bulbs, and the results were 
clearly dominated by the electricity needed for using the bulb. That steered all new 
bulb designs later on.
</p>
<p>Simplification and streamlining are particularly relevant for ecodesigners. 
Ecodesign and LCA have always had a natural connection as they both strive to 
improve the environmental performance of product systems. Although the natural 
connection between the two seems obvious, there is also a natural tension between 
them. Whereas product designers in early stages often only have limited ideas&mdash;
and thus data&mdash;on the eventual material and chemical composition of the product, 
an LCA study needs this information in order to produce useful supporting environ-
mental information for the designer at stake. Designers&rsquo; rules of thumb should be 
based on LCAs. The recent interest in meta-analysis of LCA (JIE 2012) is an inter-
esting development in that respect. However, rules of thumb always have the danger 
of being wrong. In particular, they may turn out to be self-denying in the long run.

</p>
<p>of overall life cycle impact. With the development of flat screens, the value of this 
rule of thumb has decreased dramatically. Now the presence of the rare metals may 
be a better predictor.
</p>
<p>2.4.5  Standardization of LCA Methods Beyond ISO
</p>
<p>As disclosed in Sect. 2.1.2, the past first decade of the twenty-first century showed 
 basically divergence in LCA methods again. On top of this LCA started increasingly 
supporting policies and (bioenergy) performance-based regulations. For that LCA 
results needed to be robust and reliable. Both robustness and reliability can be chal-
lenged. For example, some of these performance-based regulations in the field of bio-
energy adopted ALCA, others consequential LCA and others a hybrid of these 
approaches, resulting in different ratings and even altering preference orders for trans-
portation fuels that were the subject of these regulations. In addition, most regulations 
lack reporting requirements on the uncertainty of the LCA results and subjective 
choices by the LCA practitioner, which can result in LCA results seeming more certain 
and scientifically objective than they really are. It became clear that ISO standards were 
not sufficient to tackle these problems, and thus product carbon footprint standards 
were developed all around the world, and for EU policy applications, the International 
Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook was developed (ILCD 2010).
</p>
<p>Standardizing and harmonizing methods for supporting policies and performance- 
based regulations is of utmost importance, but it will remain a challenge to properly 
balance this need with the equally justified need of science to progress and improve 
itself. It may thus make sense to distinguish between LCAs for science and LCAs for 
policy. &ldquo;Whereas the former aims for completeness, the latter aims for robustness. The 
use of LCA in the policy context will benefit largely from the acceptance of this differ-
ence and by drawing up a guideline that is based on the aim of robustness&rdquo; (Wardenaar 
et al. 2012) with an update every now and then to include  progresses in science, the 
balance could be established. Eventually, also here there will be no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; 
solution, and we will have to accept that different questions require different approaches.
</p>
<p>A complication that is getting more and more pervasive is that software and data-
bases de facto dictate the methodology. For instance, if scientists prove that one method 
for uncertainty calculations is superior to another but the available software continues 
to offer only the inferior method, practice will not change. Similarly, scientists may 
develop noise impact methods, but if unit process databases do not offer information on 
sound emissions, such developments will remain within the academic domain only.

<p>3.1           Introduction 
</p>
<p> Climate change is a key issue in sustainability, as it may lead to dangerous increases 
</p>
<p>in temperature and sea level, fl ooding, droughts, etc. (WRI and WBCSD  2004 ). 
</p>
<p>Scientists all over the world are providing information supporting the fact that the 
</p>
<p>climate is changing and that this change is partly due to human activities through 
</p>
<p>the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs). &ldquo;Carbon&rdquo; is often used as a shorthand for 
</p>
<p>GHGs, as carbon dioxide is the main GHG released by human activities. As a con-
</p>
<p>sequence, the activity of measuring GHG emissions is often referred to as carbon 
</p>
<p>footprinting, the term we use in the reminder of this chapter. 
</p>
<p> A carbon footprint may concern an organization, a value chain, or a product 
</p>
<p>(Carbon Trust  2014 ). The organizational carbon footprint accounts for emissions 
</p>
<p>from all activities across an organization (including building energy use, industrial 
</p>
<p>processes, and the company&rsquo;s vehicles). The value chain carbon footprint includes 
</p>
<p>also emissions outside the organization&rsquo;s own operations (i.e., emissions from both 
</p>
<p>suppliers and consumers, including product use and end-of-life emissions). Finally,

<p>the product carbon footprint includes emissions over the whole life cycle of a given 
</p>
<p>unit of product or service, from the extraction of raw materials and manufacturing 
</p>
<p>to its use and fi nal reuse, recycling, or disposal. This chapter focuses on the 
</p>
<p>  organization and value chain   footprints; product-level carbon footprinting is more 
</p>
<p>closely related to life-cycle assessment ( LCA  )   , which is covered in Chap.   2     by 
</p>
<p>Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 ). 
</p>
<p> This chapter is organized into four sections. Section  3.1  provides a brief scien-
</p>
<p>tifi c background on climate change, to the extent necessary to understand the meth-
</p>
<p>odology behind carbon footprinting. It also introduces the main motivations for 
</p>
<p>carbon footprinting. Section  3.2  explains how carbon footprints can be measured 
</p>
<p>and describes several carbon accounting methodologies. Section  3.3  focuses on 
</p>
<p>supply chain carbon footprinting and provides an example from the automobile 
</p>
<p>industry. Finally, Section  3.4  provides some challenges related to supply chain car-
</p>
<p>bon footprinting in practice. 
</p>
<p>3.1.1     The Science of Climate Change 
</p>
<p> According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC  )   , 1  climate 
</p>
<p>change refers to any change in climate over time due  to   natural variability or as a result 
</p>
<p>of human activity (IPCC  2007 ). The scientifi c community has collected substantial 
</p>
<p>evidence that the climate is changing (IPCC  2013a ), as a result of the increased con-
</p>
<p>centration of GHGs in the atmosphere, which is due in part to human activity. The 
</p>
<p>main  greenhouse gases   are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, 
</p>
<p>hydrofl uorocarbons, perfl uorocarbons, and sulfur hexafl uoride. Some of these GHGs 
</p>
<p>are naturally present in the atmosphere and are responsible for the greenhouse effect, 
</p>
<p>a natural phenomenon responsible for warming the atmosphere and allowing life on 
</p>
<p>Earth. However, in recent times, GHG emissions have increased, among others, due 
</p>
<p>to industrialization and changes in agriculture and land use. Carbon dioxide, for 
</p>
<p>example, is emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. 
</p>
<p>Methane mainly comes from agriculture, livestock, and landfi lls. Nitrous oxide is 
</p>
<p>found in large quantities in nitrogen fertilizer and chemical processes. These human-
</p>
<p>made GHGs known as &ldquo; anthropogenic GHGs  &rdquo; intensify the greenhouse effect. 
</p>
<p> In order to measure the climate impact of GHG emissions, the  life-cycle assess-
</p>
<p>ment (LCA)   community (see Chap.   2     by Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 ) for more 
</p>
<p>detail) has developed an impact category called the global warming potential 
</p>
<p>( GWP). GWP   is the recommended metric to compare future climate impacts of 
</p>
<p>emissions (IPCC  2007 ). It refers to the heat trapped in the atmosphere by a given 
</p>
<p>amount of GHG over a given time period, relative to that trapped by an equivalent 
</p>
<p>amount of CO 2  during the same period. Table  3.1  shows the GWP of some GHGs 
</p>
<p>over 100-year and 20-year periods, respectively. For example, the GWP of methane 
</p>
<p>(CH 4 ) over a 100-year period is 28. This means that 1 metric ton (referred to as ton 
</p>
<p>1   IPCC is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change ( http://www.ipcc.ch/ ).

</p>
<p>in what follows) of methane in the atmosphere over 100 years traps the same amount 
</p>
<p>of heat as 28 t of carbon dioxide over 100 years.  Carbon dioxide   is taken as a refer-
</p>
<p>ence for evaluating global warming as this is the most important anthropogenic 
</p>
<p>GHG in quantity and in total impact (based on 100-year GWP calculations). 
</p>
<p>Consequently, GHG emissions are often referred to as carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>   Table  3.1  shows that the  GWP   and the atmospheric lifetime vary widely between 
</p>
<p>GHGs.  The   variation in atmospheric lifetimes means that the time period chosen to 
</p>
<p>calculate the GWP may lead to signifi cant differences. For instance, the atmospheric 
</p>
<p>lifetime of  methane   is about 12 years, much lower than that of carbon dioxide. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, the 20-year GWP of methane is much higher than the 100-year 
</p>
<p>GWP. The opposite effect occurs when the atmospheric lifetime of a GHG is much 
</p>
<p>higher than the lifetime of carbon dioxide, as is the case for CF 4 . The 100-year GWP 
</p>
<p>is used by convention in practice. However, the IPCC ( 2007 ) highlights that the 
</p>
<p>proper time horizon for evaluating dangerous anthropogenic interference in the cli-
</p>
<p>mate system has not been determined, neither scientifi cally, economically, nor 
</p>
<p>politically. We refer to Dyckhoff and Kasah ( 2014 ) for more details on the effect of 
</p>
<p>time horizons on LCA. 
</p>
<p> Using the GWP enables us to aggregate  GHG emissions   into a single metric 
</p>
<p>commonly expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) or in carbon equivalent. 
</p>
<p>These two metrics should not be confused: 3 million tons of carbon equivalent is 
</p>
<p>equal to 11 million tons of CO 2 e. The conversion between carbon equivalent and 
</p>
<p>CO 2 e is related to the ratio of the atomic mass of a carbon dioxide molecule to the 
</p>
<p>atomic mass of a carbon atom, i.e., 44/12 (EPA  2005 ). 
</p>
<p>  Carbon emissions   expressed in  CO 2 e   (or in carbon equivalent) are often thought of 
</p>
<p>as an unambiguous measure of the effect of GHGs on global warming. However, this 
</p>
<p>measure is based on various assumptions and imperfect models. Any recommenda-
</p>
<p>tion based on carbon dioxide equivalent calculations needs to acknowledge that the 
</p>
<p>results are subject to some scientifi c uncertainty. For instance, the GWPs are revised 
</p>
<p>periodically as the models used in the calculations evolve (Carbon Trust  2014 ). This 
</p>
<p>can be observed in Table  3.2 , which shows three different estimates for methane.
</p>
<p>   This has immediate implications for carbon footprinting and reporting as the 
</p>
<p>carbon footprints for different companies and especially at different points in time 
</p>
<p>may be based on different GWPs. An analogy in fi nancial accounting is the effect 
</p>
<p>of currency exchange rates: fi nancial statements are published in a single currency, 
</p>
<p>using whatever collection of exchange rates is appropriate at that time, but changes

</p>
<p>in reported  fi nancial metrics   may result in part from changes in exchange rates 
</p>
<p>rather than in actual performance. Even though one may not expect GWPs to be as 
</p>
<p>volatile as currency exchange rates, Table  3.2   shows   that the 20-year GWP for 
</p>
<p>methane has changed by about 29 % between the 1995 and 2007 IPCC reports. 
</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, using the GWP  to   aggregate different GHGs into a 
</p>
<p>single metric expressed in CO 2 e is the most common approach to carbon 
</p>
<p>footprinting.  
</p>
<p>3.1.2      Motivations for Carbon Footprinting and Reporting 
</p>
<p> Carbon footprinting has  become   more widely used (see, e.g., Minx et al.  2009 ) 
</p>
<p>than other environmental footprints, such as the ecological footprint, land foot-
</p>
<p>print, water footprint, etc. (see Chap.   4     by Hoekstra ( 2017 ) for more on water 
</p>
<p>footprinting). The main reasons for this can be linked to legislation around carbon 
</p>
<p>emissions, public awareness of climate change risks, and investors&rsquo; expectations 
</p>
<p>for carbon emission reporting. Consequently, some companies ask their suppliers 
</p>
<p>and subcontractors to provide data on their emissions. For instance, DHL requires 
</p>
<p>all its carriers to enter data on vehicles used, distance traveled, fuel effi ciency, etc., 
</p>
<p>not only to calculate total carbon emissions but also to screen the carriers for envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental performance (WRI and WBCSD  2004 ). Reducing carbon emissions can 
</p>
<p>also lead to lower costs. For instance, a survey of the Consumer Electronics 
</p>
<p>Association (CEA) found that companies measuring their carbon footprint were 
</p>
<p>able to reduce their electricity consumption by 5&ndash;25 % per million dollars of rev-
</p>
<p>enue (Vasan et al.  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Regarding regulations on carbon emissions, many governments require carbon 
</p>
<p>emitters to report their emissions annually on a mandatory basis. Other countries 
</p>
<p>have established carbon and energy taxes (e.g., the CRC Energy Effi ciency Scheme 
</p>
<p>in the UK) under which fi nancial penalties are associated with carbon emissions. 
</p>
<p>In addition, most countries have signed the Kyoto Protocol 2  that entered into force 
</p>
<p>in 2005; discussions on a follow-up agreement are taking place in Paris in 2016. 
</p>
<p>2   The Kyoto Protocol commits its parties by setting internationally binding carbon emission reduc-
tion targets (UNFCCC,  2014 ): 5 % against 1990 levels during the fi rst commitment period (2008&ndash;
2012) and at least 18 % below 1990 levels during the second commitment period (2013&ndash;2020).

</p>
<p>As a result, many governments are taking steps to reduce carbon emissions through 
</p>
<p>regional or national policies including the introduction of emission trading pro-
</p>
<p>grams (e.g., the European Union Emission Trading Scheme or ETS). Under a trad-
</p>
<p>ing system, permits are required for a given company to be allowed to emit GHGs, 
</p>
<p>and the number of available permits in the market (regional, national, or interna-
</p>
<p>tional) is limited. European companies such as Lafarge and Rockwool International 
</p>
<p>which are covered  by   the EU ETS report their carbon emissions on a mandatory 
</p>
<p>basis (CDP  2014a ). Other companies report their emissions in order to be prepared 
</p>
<p>for future regional, national, or international climate policies (Carbon Trust  2014 ; 
</p>
<p>CDP  2014a ). According to the CDP (formerly the &ldquo;Carbon Disclosure Project&rdquo;), 3  
</p>
<p>despite having no federal regulations on carbon in the USA, 69 US companies dis-
</p>
<p>closed that they are already participating in the EU ETS (CDP  2014a ). Moreover, 
</p>
<p>global companies doing business in China and South Korea such as Alstom, Bayer, 
</p>
<p>and Canadian Tire Corporation are closely monitoring emerging Chinese emission 
</p>
<p>trading systems that will soon put a price on carbon (CDP  2014a ). 
</p>
<p> Another incentive for carbon footprinting emanates from the pressure exerted by 
</p>
<p>the public, which is more and more aware of the risks of climate change. Several 
</p>
<p>reports demonstrate that climate change and global warming are nowadays consid-
</p>
<p>ered among the risks of highest concerns worldwide. For instance, in a global survey, 
</p>
<p>DHL ( 2010 ) states that 60 % of all respondents identifi ed climate change as being 
</p>
<p>among the top three most serious current world problems. In the ninth global risks 
</p>
<p>assessment report released by the World Economic Forum in 2014 (WEF  2014 ), 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Greater incidence of 
</p>
<p>extreme weather events (e.g. fl oods, storms, fi res)&rdquo; were ranked fi fth and sixth, 
</p>
<p>respectively, among the top 10 global risks. In 2014, the European Commission per-
</p>
<p>formed its second survey on climate change. The results reveal that climate change 
</p>
<p>is perceived as the third most serious issue worldwide, after &ldquo;poverty, hunger and 
</p>
<p>lack of drinking water&rdquo; and &ldquo;the economic situation&rdquo; (EC  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Investors also require that the long-term risks related to environmental externali-
</p>
<p>ties are managed in order to protect their long-term investments. For instance, the 
</p>
<p>CDP Investor Initiatives, backed in 2015 by more than 822 institutional investors 
</p>
<p>representing over US$95 trillion in assets 4 , provide investors with a global source of 
</p>
<p>annual information to support long-term objective analysis, including evidence and 
</p>
<p>insight into companies&rsquo; carbon footprint and strategies for managing climate change. 
</p>
<p>The CDP&rsquo;s Carbon Action initiative (backed by 190 investors) asks companies in 
</p>
<p>heavy emitting industries to take actions on carbon emission reduction every year, by 
</p>
<p>setting emission targets and  making   reductions while generating return on invest-
</p>
<p>ment (CDP  2014b ). 
</p>
<p>3   The CDP is an international organization that holds the largest collection of climate change-, 
water-, and forestry-related data reported by companies ( https://www.cdp.net/ ). More than 5 000 
companies report to CDP every year. For instance, in 2013, 334 fi rms in the S&amp;P 500 index have 
disclosed their emissions to CDP (CDP  2015 ).

</p>
<p> To conclude, the fi rst step toward managing carbon emissions is to measure the 
</p>
<p>carbon footprint because &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t measure it, you can&rsquo;t manage it&rdquo; (Kaplan and 
</p>
<p>Norton  1992 ). The next section is devoted to this question.   
</p>
<p>3.2      How Can a Carbon Footprint Be Measured? 
</p>
<p> This section is divided into two parts. The fi rst presents the GHG Protocol, the most 
</p>
<p>used framework to account for carbon emissions. The second part highlights the 
</p>
<p>main methods used for carbon footprinting. 
</p>
<p>3.2.1     The GHG Protocol 
</p>
<p> The GHG Protocol 5  (  www.ghgprotocol.org/    ) is  the   guideline for many existing 
</p>
<p>methodologies for  carbon   footprint measurement. It is developed by the World 
</p>
<p>Resources Institute ( WRI  ) and the World Business Council for Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development ( WBCSD  )   . The fi rst version &ldquo;The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A 
</p>
<p> Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard  &rdquo; was released in 2001. This is the 
</p>
<p>main framework for carbon emissions accounting worldwide. It is used by govern-
</p>
<p>ment and business leaders to understand, quantify, and manage their carbon foot-
</p>
<p>print. The GHG  Protocol   also serves as the foundation for nearly every GHG standard 
</p>
<p>and program in the world as well as hundreds of GHG inventories prepared by indi-
</p>
<p>vidual companies (WRI and WBCSD  2004 ). As an example, the corporate standard 
</p>
<p>serves as the basis for international standards such as ISO 14064-1 (EPA  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> The GHG Protocol is now composed of seven standards (corporate standard, 
</p>
<p>project protocol, product life-cycle standard, corporate value chain standard, 
</p>
<p>GHG Protocol for cities, mitigation goal standard, and policy and action stan-
</p>
<p>dard). At the time of writing, WRI and WBCSD have been scoping the need for a 
</p>
<p>new standard on product innovation. Among these standards, we briefl y introduce 
</p>
<p>the two that are directly related to supply chains: the corporate and corporate 
</p>
<p>value chain standards. 
</p>
<p> The corporate standard, released in 2001 and most recently amended in 2013, 
</p>
<p>provides guidance for companies in preparing a carbon emission inventory. It was 
</p>
<p>designed with the following objectives in mind (WRI and WBCSD  2004 ):
</p>
<p> &ndash;    &ldquo;To help companies prepare a carbon inventory that represents a true and fair 
</p>
<p>account of their emissions, through the use of standardized approaches and 
</p>
<p>principles.  
</p>
<p>5   Where appropriate, we quote extensively directly from the GHG Protocol throughout this 
chapter.

</p>
<p> &ndash;   To simplify and reduce the costs of compiling a carbon inventory.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   To provide business with information that can be used to build an effective strat-
</p>
<p>egy to manage and reduce carbon emissions.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   To increase  consistency   and transparency in carbon emission accounting and 
</p>
<p>reporting among various companies and GHG programs.&rdquo; 6     
</p>
<p> The corporate value chain  standard   (also referred to as Scope 3 standard), 
</p>
<p> released   in 2011, allows companies to assess their entire value chain emission 
</p>
<p>impact and identify the most effective ways to reduce emissions. The standard was 
</p>
<p>developed with the following objectives (WRI and WBCSD  2011a : 4):
</p>
<p> &ndash;    &ldquo;To help companies prepare a true and fair scope 3 GHG inventory in a cost- 
</p>
<p>effective manner, through the use of standardized approaches and principles.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   To help companies develop effective strategies for managing and reducing their 
</p>
<p>Scope 3 emissions through an understanding of value chain emissions and asso-
</p>
<p>ciated risks and opportunities.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   To support consistent  and   transparent public reporting of corporate value chain 
</p>
<p>emissions according to a standardized set of reporting requirements.&rdquo;    
</p>
<p> These two standards are built on the same underlying principles. In both cases, 
</p>
<p>setting clear boundaries is of crucial importance. The GHG Protocol recommends 
</p>
<p>setting organizational boundaries and operational boundaries.
</p>
<p>&bull;      Organizational boundaries    
</p>
<p> Two distinct approaches can  be   used: the  equity share  and the  control  approaches. 
</p>
<p>Following equity share, a company accounts for carbon emissions from opera-
</p>
<p>tions according to its share of equity in the operation (i.e., economic interest). 
</p>
<p>Typically, the share of economic risks and rewards in an operation is aligned with 
</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s percentage ownership of that operation, and equity share will be 
</p>
<p>the same as the ownership percentage. With the control approach, the company 
</p>
<p>accounts for 100 % of the carbon emissions from operations over which it has 
</p>
<p>control. Control can be defi ned in either fi nancial terms (ability to direct the 
</p>
<p>fi nancial and operating policies) or operational ones (full authority to introduce 
</p>
<p>and implement  operating   policies at the operation).  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Operational boundaries  
</p>
<p> This involves identifying carbon emissions associated with a company&rsquo;s opera-
</p>
<p>tions, categorizing them as direct or indirect emissions, and choosing the scope 
</p>
<p>of accounting and reporting for indirect emissions. The GHG Protocol distin-
</p>
<p>guishes three &ldquo;scopes&rdquo; (see Fig.  3.1 ):
</p>
<p> &ndash;      Scope 1 :  Direct carbon emissions  
</p>
<p> Direct carbon  emissions   occur from sources that are owned or controlled by 
</p>
<p>the company, for example, emissions from combustion in owned or controlled

</p>
<p> boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc., or emissions from chemical production in 
</p>
<p>owned or controlled process equipment.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;    Scope 2 :  Purchased energy indirect carbon emissions  
</p>
<p> Scope 2 accounts for carbon emissions from the generation of purchased or 
</p>
<p>acquired electricity, steam, heating, or cooling consumed by the reporting 
</p>
<p>company. Scope 2 emissions physically occur at a facility outside the organi-
</p>
<p>zational boundary of the reporting company.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;    Scope 3 :  Other indirect carbon emissions  
</p>
<p> Scope 3 allows for the treatment of all  other   indirect emissions. Scope 3 emis-
</p>
<p>sions are a consequence of the activities of the company, but occur from 
</p>
<p>sources owned or controlled by other entities in the value chain (e.g., materi-
</p>
<p>als suppliers, third-party logistics providers, waste management suppliers, 
</p>
<p>travel suppliers, lessees and lessors, franchisees, retailers, employees, and 
</p>
<p>customers). Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions including both 
</p>
<p>upstream (e.g., purchased products or purchased products transportation) 
</p>
<p>and downstream emissions (e.g., use of sold products or disposal of sold 
</p>
<p>products).       
</p>
<p> These three scopes are mutually exclusive for the reporting company. Scope 3 
</p>
<p>emissions do not include any emissions already accounted for as Scope 1 or Scope 
</p>
<p>2 by the same company. They enable clarifying the distinction between corporate 
</p>
<p>and value chain standards. Under the corporate standard, companies are required to

<p>51
</p>
<p>report all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, while reporting Scope 3 emissions is 
</p>
<p>optional. The corporate value chain standard is designed to create further consis-
</p>
<p>tency in Scope 3 inventories through additional requirements and guidance for 
</p>
<p>Scope 3 accounting and reporting (WRI and WBCSD  2011a ). 
</p>
<p> Once the organizational and operational  boundaries   are defi ned, the  carbon   foot-
</p>
<p>print can be measured. The next section gives an overview of the main  methodologies 
</p>
<p>used to measure the carbon footprint.  
</p>
<p>3.2.2     Methodologies for Measuring the Carbon Footprint 
</p>
<p> Various methods for measuring carbon emissions have been proposed. We classify 
</p>
<p>them by the level of extrapolation involved, from the most direct measurement 
</p>
<p>methodology to the one relying most heavily on extrapolation:
</p>
<p> &ndash;    Direct measurement  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   Energy-based calculations  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   Activity-based calculations  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   Economic input&ndash;output life-cycle assessment (EIO-LCA)   
</p>
<p>&bull;     Direct measurement  
</p>
<p> The direct measurement  methodology   is usually applied to production sites. The 
</p>
<p>measurement of emissions is achieved by continuously measuring the pollutants 
</p>
<p>emitted into the atmosphere in exhaust gases from combustion or industrial pro-
</p>
<p>cesses, often via the use of continuous emission monitoring systems (EPA  2008 ). 
</p>
<p>Due to their high cost, continuous emission monitoring systems are mainly 
</p>
<p>installed in production sites subject to environmental regulations and process 
</p>
<p>monitoring applications such as the US EPA 40 CFR Part 75 and 40 CFR Part 60. 
</p>
<p>Apart from these sites under regulation, direct measurement of carbon emissions 
</p>
<p>by monitoring concentration and fl ow rate is not common in supply chains. 
</p>
<p>Direct measurement is generally only applicable for a share of Scope 1 
</p>
<p>emissions.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Energy - based calculations  
</p>
<p>  Energy-based calculations   determine carbon emissions based on mass balance or 
</p>
<p>theoretical combustion specifi c to a facility or a process. This methodology 
</p>
<p>applies mainly to fuel consumption, both at production sites and for transporta-
</p>
<p>tion. Several levels of analysis may be conducted, depending on the information 
</p>
<p>available. Indeed, the amount of fuel combusted is generally not directly 
</p>
<p> monitored, and extrapolation based on the amount of fuel consumed is common-
</p>
<p>place. In addition, the carbon content of a given combusted fuel is often  estimated 
</p>
<p>based on average values. Energy-based calculations may also be applied for indi-
</p>
<p>rect emissions from electricity consumption, as many providers release the aver-
</p>
<p>age level of carbon emissions per unit of electricity produced. Energy-based 
</p>
<p>calculations require information that is generally available for a share of Scope 1 
</p>

<p>52
</p>
<p>and Scope 2 emissions. This is most applicable to process-related emissions such 
</p>
<p>as those from cement, aluminum, and waste processing (DEFRA  2009 ) and to 
</p>
<p>transportation-related emissions.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Activity - based calculations  
</p>
<p> An activity-based  calculation   method aims at deriving the carbon emissions 
</p>
<p>from activity information by using conversion factors. These factors are calcu-
</p>
<p>lated ratios relating carbon emissions to a proxy measure of activity at an emis-
</p>
<p>sions source. They are often referred to as emission factors. Activity-based 
</p>
<p>calculation is the most common approach used to calculate carbon emissions 
</p>
<p>(DEFRA  2009 ). The available activity-based methods differ in their level of 
</p>
<p>aggregation, some of them requiring more detailed information than other 
</p>
<p>(Velazquez-Martinez et al.  2014 ). As an example, consider a reporting company 
</p>
<p>that uses truck transportation for inbound deliveries. Assume that transportation 
</p>
<p>is outsourced to a third-party logistics provider and are therefore Scope 3 emis-
</p>
<p>sions. Data on fuel consumption (required for energy-based calculation) are 
</p>
<p>generally not shared by third-party logistics providers, as fuel consumption is a 
</p>
<p>key element in the cost structure of truck transportation and the carrier is usu-
</p>
<p>ally not willing to share information about his cost structure with the customer. 
</p>
<p>In this case, the reporting company can apply activity-based calculation, by 
</p>
<p>converting the weight transported over a given distance and using a given type 
</p>
<p>of truck to estimate average carbon emissions by using emission factors. Several 
</p>
<p>initiatives provide such type of emission factors for the main supply chain 
</p>
<p>activities. Chapter   7     by Blanco and Sheffi  ( 2017 ) provides more detail in the 
</p>
<p>context of logistics.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Economic input&ndash;output life-cycle assessment  ( EIO - LCA ) 
</p>
<p>  EIO-LCA   enables converting the expenditures by a company in a given industry 
</p>
<p> sector   into an average amount of carbon emissions. For instance, $X spent in the 
</p>
<p>transport industry sector leads on average to Y tons of CO 2 e. We refer to 
</p>
<p>Hendrickson et al. ( 2010 ) for a detailed exposition of the approach and to Huang 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2009 ) for an application of  EIO-LCA   to estimate that the carbon footprint 
</p>
<p>of all economic sectors in the US. EIO-LCA is relatively widespread, especially 
</p>
<p>in the USA, due to its ease of use. However, one limitation of EIO-LCA is that it 
</p>
<p>exclusively accounts for upstream emissions. 
</p>
<p> Methodologies relying less on extrapolation will provide more accurate 
</p>
<p>estimation of the true carbon footprint of operations. For example, Matthews 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2008 ) state that fi rm-level data such as electricity and energy use will 
</p>
<p>produce more accurate footprint results than EIO-LCA. On the other hand, the 
</p>
<p>data required to apply a methodology that relies less on extrapolation may be 
</p>
<p>harder to gather or simply not available. O&rsquo;Rourke ( 2014 ) mentions that 
</p>
<p>accessing data from full supply chains can be expensive, time consuming, 
</p>
<p>and, sometimes, impossible. There is an inherent trade-off between the scope 
</p>
<p>of measurement chosen (and consequently the portion of the total footprint 
</p>
<p>analyzed) and the accuracy of the estimation made. (We return to the issue of 
</p>
<p>accuracy in Sect.  3.4.2 .) Consequently, defi ning the right scope for carbon

</p>
<p>emission measurement is of crucial importance as this decision will have 
</p>
<p>strong implications for the type of measurement methods that can be imple-
</p>
<p>mented. One of the key questions here consists in assessing the importance of 
</p>
<p>Scope  3   emissions for the reporting company. If Scope 3 emissions represent 
</p>
<p>a small share of total supply chain emissions for the company, it may make 
</p>
<p>more sense to focus on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and to apply a more 
</p>
<p>direct methodology. However, Scope 3 emissions can be of high impor-
</p>
<p>tance when it represents  a   large share of a company&rsquo;s carbon footprint, as is 
</p>
<p>true for most fi rms. We discuss the importance of Scope 3 emissions in more 
</p>
<p>depth below.      
</p>
<p>3.3       Supply Chain Carbon Footprinting   
</p>
<p> This section is divided into four parts. First, the importance of Scope 3 emissions in 
</p>
<p>supply chain carbon footprinting is analyzed. Second, the process of supply chain 
</p>
<p>carbon footprinting is presented. Then, the process of carbon footprinting in a sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain is illustrated by referring to the process followed by Hyundai Motor 
</p>
<p>Company (HMC) (as described in Lee ( 2011 )). Finally, some issues related to car-
</p>
<p>bon footprint allocation among different supply chain partners are discussed. 
</p>
<p>3.3.1      Importance of Scope 3 Emissions 
</p>
<p> Matthews et al. ( 2008 ) estimated that on average 74 % of an industry sector&rsquo;s car-
</p>
<p>bon footprint is attributed to upstream  Scope 3 emissions   (without accounting for 
</p>
<p>downstream Scope 3 emissions). This average value gives an idea of the importance 
</p>
<p>of accounting for carbon emissions through the supply chain. Huang et al. ( 2009 ) 
</p>
<p>focused on upstream emissions of US economic sectors and provided a sector- 
</p>
<p>specifi c repartition of emissions from Scope 1 to Scope 3. 
</p>
<p> Huang et al. show that the impact of upstream Scope 3 emissions is substantial 
</p>
<p>for most of the US industry sectors. Moreover, a large share of US companies&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>upstream Scope 3 emissions can be attributed to their top-10 suppliers. This result 
</p>
<p>may help a company to understand which upstream Scope 3 category contributes 
</p>
<p>most to its total carbon footprint and thus help it focus its measurement efforts on 
</p>
<p>relevant suppliers. In practice, companies often focus on measuring the portion of 
</p>
<p>their Scope 3 emissions related to employee commuting and business travel. 
</p>
<p>However, CDP ( 2013a ) indicates that 72 % of the global 500 companies reporting 
</p>
<p>to CDP report emissions from business travel even if these emissions account for 
</p>
<p>only 0.2 % of total reported Scope 3 emissions. CDP ( 2013a ) concludes that &ldquo;instead 
</p>
<p>of measuring carbon-intensive activities in their supply chain, companies often 
</p>
<p>focus on relatively insignifi cant opportunities for carbon reduction.&rdquo;

</p>
<p> Huang et al. ( 2009 ) also show that the portion of Scope 3 emissions widely  varies 
</p>
<p>from one industry sector to another. This explains why it is diffi cult to provide 
</p>
<p>generic guidance on which emissions of Scope 3 to include in the inventory (see 
</p>
<p>Sect.  3.3.2  for more details), leading Huang et al. ( 2009 ) to recommend that proto-
</p>
<p>col organizations develop sector-specifi c Scope 3 guidelines. 
</p>
<p> Even companies that voluntarily disclose Scope 3 emissions are under no obli-
</p>
<p>gation to be comprehensive. To estimate how (in)complete current Scope 3 emis-
</p>
<p>sions reports are, Blanco et al. ( 2014 ) compare CDP disclosures by US fi rms to the 
</p>
<p>predicted breakdown of emissions in Huang et al. ( 2009 ). They estimate that US 
</p>
<p>fi rms that disclose any Scope 3 emissions in 2013 only reported 22 % of their full 
</p>
<p>upstream supply chain emissions to CDP. Scope 3 reporting is generally underde-
</p>
<p>veloped even though companies are progressively improving.  The   next section 
</p>
<p>provides some general guidelines on how to perform supply chain carbon 
</p>
<p>footprinting.  
</p>
<p>3.3.2      The Process of Supply Chain Carbon Footprinting 
</p>
<p> The supply chain carbon footprint corresponds to Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. 
</p>
<p>Accounting for Scope 3 emissions, and therefore the value chain carbon footprint, 
</p>
<p>need not involve a full-blown inventory of all products and operations, which would 
</p>
<p>generally be infeasible. Usually it is most valuable to focus on the major GHG- 
</p>
<p>generating activities. As mentioned above, the structure of Scope 3 emissions varies 
</p>
<p>from one industry sector to another, and consequently, it is diffi cult to provide 
</p>
<p>generic guidance on which Scope 3 emissions to include in an inventory. However, 
</p>
<p>some general steps can be articulated (WRI and WBCSD  2011a ):
</p>
<p>    1.     Describe the value chain . It is important, for the sake of transparency, to provide 
</p>
<p>a general description of the value chain and the associated carbon emission 
</p>
<p>sources.   
</p>
<p>   2.     Determine which Scope 3 categories are relevant . Only some types of upstream 
</p>
<p>or downstream emission categories might be relevant to the reporting com-
</p>
<p>pany. They may be relevant, for example,  because   they are large (or believed 
</p>
<p>to be large) relative to the company&rsquo;s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, they 
</p>
<p>contribute to the company&rsquo;s carbon risk exposure, they are deemed critical by 
</p>
<p>key stakeholders (e.g., feedback from customers, suppliers, investors, or civil 
</p>
<p>society), etc.   
</p>
<p>   3.     Identify partners along the value chain , e.g., customers or users, product design-
</p>
<p>ers, manufacturers, energy providers, etc. This is important when trying to 
</p>
<p> identify sources, obtain relevant data, and calculate emissions.   
</p>
<p>   4.     Quantify Scope 3 emissions . While data availability and reliability may infl uence 
</p>
<p>which Scope 3 activities are included in the inventory, it is accepted that data 
</p>
<p>accuracy may be lower. It may be more important to understand the relative 
</p>
<p>T. Boukherroub et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>55
</p>
<p>magnitude of and possible changes to Scope 3 activities. Emission estimates are 
</p>
<p>acceptable as long as there is transparency with regard to the estimation approach, 
</p>
<p>and the data used for the analysis are adequate to support the objectives of the 
</p>
<p>inventory. Verifi cation of Scope 3 emissions will often be diffi cult and may only 
</p>
<p>be considered if data  is   of reliable quality.    
</p>
<p>3.3.3       An Example from the Automobile Industry 
</p>
<p> To better understand  how   carbon footprinting might work in practice, we briefl y sum-
</p>
<p>marize Lee ( 2011 ), who describes a three-step process that HMC took jointly with its 
</p>
<p>ten-key 1st-tier suppliers in a pilot study, to measure carbon emissions in the upstream 
</p>
<p>supply chain. The study focused on Avante passenger car model manufacturing. Lee 
</p>
<p>mentioned that one of the most diffi cult challenges that HMC faced was determining 
</p>
<p>the emission boundary. Based on the GHG Protocol, direct  (in- house) and limited 
</p>
<p>indirect carbon emission boundaries were considered, while downstream stages of 
</p>
<p>distribution, consumers, disposal, and recycling were excluded (Lee  2011 ). The fi rst 
</p>
<p>step is to identify the key suppliers&rsquo; carbon footprint. HMC set up guidelines and 
</p>
<p>provided measurement manuals to key suppliers. Based on this, each supplier con-
</p>
<p>ducted Scope 1 and 2 emission measurement and reporting, using a direct measure-
</p>
<p>ment methodology. The scope of the guidelines prepared by HMC includes raw 
</p>
<p>material suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. In the second step, a carbon pro-
</p>
<p>cess map was established to identify each component and part at each stage of the 
</p>
<p>simplifi ed supply chain. This process helped HMC and its suppliers to calculate the 
</p>
<p>carbon footprint of each component and part. The carbon process map also helped 
</p>
<p>HMC and its suppliers to identify components and parts with high carbon burdens. 
</p>
<p>Finally, in the third step, HMC and its suppliers calculated the products&rsquo; carbon foot-
</p>
<p>print by adding the carbon emissions of the supply chain stages. Regarding the front 
</p>
<p>bumper product, for example, it was found that through the simplifi ed supply chain, 
</p>
<p>the raw material stage accounts for 18 % of the carbon emissions, the manufacturing 
</p>
<p>stage accounts for 70 %, and the distribution accounts around 12 % (Lee  2011 ). 
</p>
<p> Although reporting Scope 3 emissions is optional and might be diffi cult (data 
</p>
<p>availability, data reliability, supplier capability, etc.), a supply chain carbon footprint 
</p>
<p>that includes these emissions is very important from a decision-making  perspective, 
</p>
<p>as discussed in Sect.  3.3.1 . As stated by Lee ( 2011 ), reducing the supply chain carbon 
</p>
<p>emissions may be more cost effective for companies than reducing direct or purchased 
</p>
<p>electricity-related emissions (Scopes 1 and 2). Indeed, accounting for carbon  emissions 
</p>
<p>along the value chain can help companies to identify where to allocate limited 
</p>
<p>resources in a way that maximizes carbon emission reduction while possibly lowering 
</p>
<p>costs at the same time. For instance, a senior manager of one of HMC&rsquo;s suppliers 
</p>
<p>stated that &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t realize how much electricity we wasted during the production 
</p>
<p>stage and the importance of effi cient energy  management from raw materials to distri-
</p>
<p>bution. We learned that carbon footprint identifi cation and measurement practice 
</p>

<p>56
</p>
<p>brought cost savings, and we also began to re-examine our products design to mini-
</p>
<p>mize  carbon   footprint in our products and their supply chain&rdquo; (Lee  2011 : 1221).  
</p>
<p>3.3.4     Emission Allocation in Supply Chains 7  
</p>
<p> In determining the  carbon   footprint for an organization, value chain, or product, it 
</p>
<p>is generally necessary to allocate shared emissions to separate units. For instance, 
</p>
<p>emissions of a truck need to be allocated to all the products transported on that 
</p>
<p>truck. Emissions caused by heating, cooling, and lighting in a plant need to be allo-
</p>
<p>cated to the range of products and customers that it serves. Allocation is a thorny 
</p>
<p>issue  in   LCA in general (see also Chap.   2     by Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs,  2017 ) and hence 
</p>
<p>also for carbon footprinting. 
</p>
<p> Chapter   8     in &ldquo;The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting 
</p>
<p>and Reporting Standard&rdquo; (WRI and WBCSD  2011a ) provides guidance on allocat-
</p>
<p>ing emissions. Accordingly, allocation should be avoided or minimized when pos-
</p>
<p>sible, by collecting more detailed data through (1) obtaining product-level GHG 
</p>
<p>data from value chain partners, (2) separately submetering energy use and other 
</p>
<p>activity data (e.g., at the production line level), and (3) using engineering models to 
</p>
<p>separately estimate emissions related to each product produced. 
</p>
<p> When allocation is inevitable, companies should select the allocation approach 
</p>
<p>that (1) best refl ects the causal relationship between the production of the outputs 
</p>
<p>and the resulting emissions, (2) results in the most accurate and credible emission 
</p>
<p>estimates, (3) best supports effective decision-making and GHG reduction  activities, 
</p>
<p>and (4) otherwise adheres to the principles of relevance, accuracy, completeness, 
</p>
<p>consistency, and transparency (WRI and WBCSD  2011a ). It is preferable to use a 
</p>
<p>physical relationship between the multiple inputs/outputs and the quantity of emis-
</p>
<p>sions generated, through allocation factors such as mass, volume, energy, chemical, 
</p>
<p>number of units, or others (e.g., protein content of food coproducts or fl oor space 
</p>
<p>occupied by products); otherwise the remaining options are to use  economic factors 
</p>
<p>(by value) or other relationships. This is because physical factors are expected to 
</p>
<p>best refl ect the causal relationship between the production of the outputs and the 
</p>
<p>resulting emissions. Clearly, different allocation methods are prone to yielding sig-
</p>
<p>nifi cantly different results. 
</p>
<p> The general method proposed by WRI and WBCSD ( 2011a ) to allocate emis-
</p>
<p>sions from a facility is to multiply total facility emissions by the reporting compa-
</p>
<p>ny&rsquo;s purchases as a fraction of total production. For example, using  mass   as the 
</p>
<p>allocation factor:
</p>

and Reporting Standard&rdquo; (WRI and WBCSD  2011a ) and on Caro et al. ( 2013 ), both of which 
sources we cite at various points throughout this section.

Total Emissions.&acute;
</p>
<p>   
</p>
<p>As for collecting and allocating GHG emissions from suppliers, two basic 
</p>
<p>approaches are suggested:
</p>
<p>&bull;    Supplier allocation. Individual suppliers report preallocated emission data to the 
</p>
<p>reporting company and disclose the allocation metric used.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Reporting company allocation. The reporting company allocates supplier emis-
</p>
<p>sions by obtaining two types of data from individual suppliers: (1) total supplier 
</p>
<p>GHG emission data (e.g., at the facility or business unit level) and (2) the report-
</p>
<p>ing company&rsquo;s share of the supplier&rsquo;s total production, based on either physical 
</p>
<p>factors (e.g., units of production, mass, volume, or other metrics) or economic 
</p>
<p>factors (e.g., revenue, spend).    
</p>
<p> It is argued that reporting company allocation is likely to ensure more consistency 
</p>
<p>in methodologies for the reporting company, while the supplier allocation approach 
</p>
<p>may be more practical by avoiding the need for suppliers to report confi dential busi-
</p>
<p>ness information. Finally, examples and guidance for determining the most appropri-
</p>
<p>ate allocation method to use are also provided by WRI and WBCSD ( 2011a ). 
</p>
<p> Many GHG emissions are the result of joint processes by multiple parties in a 
</p>
<p>supply chain (Caro et al.  2013 ). A typical product goes through numerous manu-
</p>
<p>facturing and transportation stages operated by a number of companies in a supply 
</p>
<p>chain. Although joint production can occur anywhere, it is likely to be particularly 
</p>
<p>common in indirect goods and services, which do not become part of the fi nal 
</p>
<p>product or service. Consequently, further reductions in emissions&mdash;in addition to 
</p>
<p>those of a fi rm&rsquo;s own operations&mdash;can be achieved by joint effort of multiple par-
</p>
<p>ties in a supply chain through collaboration, coordination, or information sharing. 
</p>
<p>This brings in also additional cost-saving opportunities. The CDP  2015  supply 
</p>
<p>chain report notes that companies that engage with one or more of their suppliers, 
</p>
<p>consumers, or other partners are more than twice as likely to see a fi nancial return 
</p>
<p>from their emission reduction investments and almost twice as likely to reduce 
</p>
<p>emissions, as those who do not engage with their value chain (CDP  2015 ). 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when a number of fi rms jointly affect total emissions, they face a 
</p>
<p>critical and nontrivial challenge in measuring their share of the responsibility for 
</p>
<p>emissions (or that of the emission reductions): How should the emissions be allo-
</p>
<p>cated to the various value chains, organizations, fi nal products, or services? The 
</p>
<p>CDP  2011  supply chain report found that 86 % of respondents have a collaborative 
</p>
<p>process in place to jointly reduce carbon footprints with suppliers (up from 49 % 
</p>
<p>the year before), but suppliers face diffi culties in allocating their emissions to their 
</p>
<p>multiple customers (CDP  2011 ). 
</p>
<p> In the LCA and  carbon   footprinting literatures, various guidelines exist on how 
</p>
<p>to allocate shared emissions. A common attribute in those guidelines&mdash;including 
</p>
<p>that of the GHG Protocol covered in this section&mdash;is that the sum of the allocated 
</p>
<p>emissions for each output of a system should equal 100 % of emissions from the 
</p>
<p>3 Carbon Footprinting in Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58
</p>
<p>system. Given that LCA is aimed at making product and process design decisions 
</p>
<p>based on an accurate inventory of environmental impacts, it is natural that the LCA 
</p>
<p>literature seeks to avoid over-allocation, i.e., &ldquo;double counting,&rdquo; of impacts 
</p>
<p>(see, e.g., Lenzen  2008 ). Similarly, in trading schemes, avoiding double counting 
</p>
<p>of GHG emissions is crucial due to the fi nancial consequences involved. More 
</p>
<p>recently the LCA literature has started investigating how to reconcile allocating 
</p>
<p>responsibility for impacts while avoiding double counting. Lenzen et al. ( 2007 ), 
</p>
<p>building on Gallego and Lenzen ( 2005 ), propose a scheme by which producers and 
</p>
<p>consumers share responsibility for emissions in such a way that adding total 
</p>
<p> emissions across all producers and consumers yields the correct economy-wide 
</p>
<p>emissions. Nevertheless, Caro et al. ( 2013 ) argue that whenever emissions (or 
</p>
<p>reduction in emissions) result from multiple parties, double counting is necessary 
</p>
<p>to induce the optimal level of abatement effort among the supply chain members. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, even if the true social cost of carbon emissions is internalized 
</p>
<p>(e.g., by applying a carbon tax to all supply chain members), the abatement efforts 
</p>
<p>implemented would be less than the optimal level when double counting is avoided. 
</p>
<p>Even in the absence of an optimal allocation rule (which would require double 
</p>
<p>counting), fi rms with an interest in overall supply chain effi ciency should at a mini-
</p>
<p>mum include the full cost of all GHG emissions that they can infl uence when they 
</p>
<p>decide where to focus their efforts. The fact that double counting is unlikely to be 
</p>
<p>implemented on a large scale in practice should not preclude fi rms from identify-
</p>
<p>ing where their efforts may have the greatest effect. If the greatest return on fi rm 
</p>
<p>1&rsquo;s effort is on emissions currently allocated to fi rm 2, then fi rm 1 could explore 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to share the costs and benefi ts of reducing emissions with fi rm 2. 
</p>
<p>Without at least allowing double counting in a  pro   forma fashion, many valuable 
</p>
<p>opportunities for joint improvement will go unexploited.   
</p>
<p>3.4      Discussion 
</p>
<p> This section discusses several issues related to supply chain carbon footprinting. We 
</p>
<p>fi rst introduce the challenges related to gathering information necessary to  calculate 
</p>
<p>a carbon footprint. Second, we discuss the issue of accuracy. Third, we highlight the 
</p>
<p>need to extend the horizon of sustainable supply chains beyond carbon emissions. 
</p>
<p>3.4.1     How to Get Information in Practice? 
</p>
<p> The amount of data required to calculate the carbon footprint of a company is 
</p>
<p> substantial, and the data are often diffi cult to gather, especially when performing a 
</p>
<p>value chain carbon footprint. For instance, when Fujitsu carried out a carbon foot-
</p>
<p>print analysis on its desktop PC and servers to show customers its product&rsquo;s superi-
</p>
<p>ority through reduced carbon emissions, it faced some challenges to gather data in

<p>59
</p>
<p>the use and disposal phases and had to make numerous assumptions to be able to 
</p>
<p>conduct a cradle-to-grave LCA (Vasan et al.  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Even when the data exist, most companies are not organized to systematically and 
</p>
<p>automatically collect these data, although ERP systems are progressively including 
</p>
<p>information on carbon footprint and other  sustainability metrics  . In this regard, SAP, 
</p>
<p>IBM, SAS, and other software vendors have built tools to extract energy data from 
</p>
<p>supply chain procurement systems (O&rsquo;Rourke  2014 ). Some companies have also 
</p>
<p>developed their own software. For instance, in the energy sector, an Excel-based data 
</p>
<p>management information system called SANGEA TM  Energy and Greenhouse Gas 
</p>
<p>Emissions Estimating System has been implemented by  Chevron Corporation in 2002   
</p>
<p>to gather carbon emissions and energy usage data from energy operations (exploration 
</p>
<p>and production, refi ning and marketing, petrochemicals, transportation, electricity 
</p>
<p>generation, manufacturing, real estate, and coal activities) at its facilities worldwide. 
</p>
<p>The company used the software to  compile its fi rst corporate-wide carbon inventory 
</p>
<p>(Chevron  2002 ). SANGEA&trade; streamlines corporate-level data consolidation by 
</p>
<p>allowing the inventory coordinator at each facility to confi gure a spreadsheet, enter 
</p>
<p>monthly data, and send quarterly reports to a centralized database (WRI and WBCSD 
</p>
<p> 2004 ). The software, which was available free of charge for other companies in the oil 
</p>
<p>and gas sector, has been donated to the American Petroleum Institute ( API  )   . More 
</p>
<p>recently, Chevron developed in 2009 its GHG and Energy Reporting System 
</p>
<p>CGERS TM  to align with existing and emerging regulatory requirements (Chevron 
</p>
<p> 2009 ). In 2010, the company completed enterprise-wide deployment of the software 
</p>
<p>and improved it in 2012 by incorporating mechanisms to facilitate electronic report-
</p>
<p>ing to the US Environmental Protection Agency (CDP  2013b ). 
</p>
<p> However, currently most companies need to manually combine data from dispa-
</p>
<p>rate sources to compile the carbon footprint, often in spreadsheets. As data collec-
</p>
<p>tion and compilation is not standardized, the process is reiterated every year. This is 
</p>
<p>often a time-consuming task, subject to errors and/or approximations. Thus, DEFRA 
</p>
<p>( 2009 ) recommends that companies include carbon emissions reporting into exist-
</p>
<p>ing reporting tools and processes of the organization. Interface, Inc., the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>largest manufacturer of carpet tiles, has developed an environmental data system 
</p>
<p>based on its corporate  fi nancial data reporting  . This system provides activity and 
</p>
<p>material fl ow data from the company&rsquo;s business units (the USA, Canada, Australia, 
</p>
<p>Europe, etc.) and metrics (the Interface&rsquo;s EcoMetrics) for measuring progress on 
</p>
<p>environmental issues including carbon emissions. The data are reported to a central 
</p>
<p>database each quarter and made available for establishing Interface&rsquo;s annual inven-
</p>
<p>tory and enabling data comparison over time (WRI and WBCSD  2004 ). 
</p>
<p> The manual, time-consuming compilation of data from separate sources also 
</p>
<p>causes a  transparency issue  . Indeed, it is very hard to keep all the calculations trans-
</p>
<p>parent and it is quite easy to introduce mistakes. Several organizations propose 
</p>
<p>expertise and data to support companies in the process of carbon footprint measure-
</p>
<p>ment. For instance, in the transportation sector, DHL, through its GREEN 
</p>
<p>SERVICES portfolio, offers a suite of tools such as Track and Trace, Carbon Report, 
</p>
<p>and Carbon Dashboard to assist companies in reporting their carbon emissions and 
</p>
<p>identifying reduction opportunities. The Carbon Dashboard (a web-based version of 
</p>
<p>3 Carbon Footprinting in Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>60
</p>
<p>the Carbon Report) allows companies to access statistics on the carbon emissions 
</p>
<p>generated by the transport of their freight, and based on this information, they can 
</p>
<p>consider scenarios to reduce their carbon footprint. 8  
</p>
<p> Some other organizations have also developed carbon footprint certifi cation pro-
</p>
<p>grams to enable companies to report a verifi ed carbon footprint. For example, DHL 
</p>
<p>states that the reporting methodologies and calculation tools used in its express and 
</p>
<p>air, ocean, and road freight divisions have been verifi ed by the Swiss-based Soci&eacute;t&eacute; 
</p>
<p>G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Surveillance (SGS) since 2011 (DHL  2015 ). However, even third-party 
</p>
<p>audits may miss errors by focusing more on whether correct conversion factors 
</p>
<p>were used than on whether the input data are correct and complete. The question of 
</p>
<p>how to collect and organize verifi able information in an effi cient way, without 
</p>
<p> having to redo it every year, is of crucial importance for companies and deserves 
</p>
<p>particular attention.  
</p>
<p>3.4.2      How Accurate Is Accurate Enough? 
</p>
<p> Carbon footprinting is always associated with a certain level of uncertainty. More 
</p>
<p>particularly, as Scope 3 covers activities that are not under the reporting company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>ownership or control, companies are likely to face additional challenges that con-
</p>
<p>tribute to uncertainty in  Scope 3 accounting   (WRI and WBCSD  2011a ). Lee ( 2011 ) 
</p>
<p>reports that one senior manager from HMC stated: &ldquo;we had some diffi culties in 
</p>
<p>terms of scopes and measurement of carbon footprint. In our case, Scope 1 and 2 
</p>
<p>carbon footprint measurements are completed with over 95 % confi dence. But 
</p>
<p>Scope 3 CO 2  measurement is still limited with regard to the supply chain network. 
</p>
<p>We should explore further feasible methods and practices to track CO 2  emissions 
</p>
<p>from the supply chain.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> Uncertainties related to carbon inventories can be categorized into scientifi c 
</p>
<p>uncertainty and estimation uncertainty (WRI and WBCSD  2004 ). Scientifi c 
</p>
<p>uncertainty arises when the science of the actual emission is not completely 
</p>
<p>understood. For example, many direct and indirect factors associated with GWP 
</p>
<p>values involve signifi cant scientifi c uncertainty (IPCC  2000 ). The evolution of the 
</p>
<p>100-year GWP of methane from 21 in the second IPCC report in 2005 (see 
</p>
<p>Table  3.2 ) to 28 in the fi fth IPCC report in 2013 (see Table  3.1 ) is an example of 
</p>
<p>scientifi c uncertainty.  Analyzing and quantifying scientifi c uncertainty   is chal-
</p>
<p>lenging and best addressed by the scientifi c community rather than by companies 
</p>
<p>(IPCC  2000 ). 
</p>
<p> Estimation uncertainty occurs any time carbon emissions are quantifi ed. Therefore 
</p>
<p>each carbon footprint is associated with estimation uncertainty.  Estimation uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty   can be further classifi ed into two types: model uncertainty and  parameter

</p>
<p>uncertainty (IPCC  2000 ). Model uncertainty occurs when the emissions are not 
</p>
<p>directly measured (i.e., under energy-based calculations, activity-based calculations, 
</p>
<p>and EIO-LCA). In this case, a model translates a given input into a certain amount of 
</p>
<p>carbon emissions. The way this translation is handled is subject to uncertainty 
</p>
<p>referred to as model uncertainty. For instance, estimating emissions from truck trans-
</p>
<p>portation under an energy-based calculation methodology would lead to uncertainty 
</p>
<p>in the precise amount of carbon emissions released by the motor, as this depends on 
</p>
<p>the quality of the combustion and thus on the operating conditions of the vehicle. 
</p>
<p>  Parameter uncertainty   refers to the uncertainty associated with quantifying the 
</p>
<p>parameters used as inputs into estimation models (IPCC  2000 ), for instance, the 
</p>
<p>amount of fuel consumed by the truck. 
</p>
<p> Given that uncertainty is an intrinsic part of any carbon footprint assessment, an 
</p>
<p>immediate question is what level of uncertainty is acceptable. On the one hand, 
</p>
<p>high-quality information has greater value and more uses, and even if a company 
</p>
<p>does not anticipate future regulatory mechanisms, internal and external  stakeholders 
</p>
<p>may demand high-quality inventory information (WRI and WBCSD  2004 ). On the 
</p>
<p>other hand, in the context of carbon emission regulations, low-quality information 
</p>
<p>may have little or no value and may even incur penalties. Defi ning the level of accu-
</p>
<p>racy depends on the carbon footprinting analysis objective, as well as on the capa-
</p>
<p>bility of the company. However, this decision may greatly infl uence the  estimated 
</p>
<p>carbon footprint of a company. This decision is referred to as the application of a 
</p>
<p>cutoff threshold in the LCA literature. 
</p>
<p> Once the desired level of accuracy has been determined, the next question is how 
</p>
<p>to report uncertainties in carbon footprints. Given that only parameter uncertainties 
</p>
<p>are within the feasible scope of most companies, uncertainty estimates for carbon 
</p>
<p>inventories will necessarily be imperfect (IPCC  2000 ). Parameter  uncertainties   can 
</p>
<p>be evaluated through statistical analysis, measurement equipment precision deter-
</p>
<p>minations, and expert judgment (IPCC  2000 ). Statistical analysis may be diffi cult 
</p>
<p>due to a lack of complete and robust sample data. Most of the time, a single data 
</p>
<p>point is available (e.g., liters of fuel for truck transportation). In case the data is 
</p>
<p>obtained from an instrument, precision and/or calibration information may be used. 
</p>
<p>However, IPCC ( 2000 ) states that expert judgment is often the only possibility for 
</p>
<p>companies. Experts can either be the source of the necessary data, or they can help 
</p>
<p>identify and explain uncertainties. The problem with expert judgment is that it is 
</p>
<p>diffi cult to obtain in a comparable and consistent manner across parameters, source 
</p>
<p>categories, or companies (WRI and WBCSD  2004 ). 
</p>
<p> The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard has developed a supplementary guidance 
</p>
<p>document on uncertainty assessments along with an uncertainty calculation tool 
</p>
<p>(WRI and WBCSD  2011b ). The guidance document describes how to use the 
</p>
<p>calculation tool in aggregating uncertainties. It also discusses in more depth differ-
</p>
<p>ent types of uncertainties, the limitations of quantitative uncertainty assessment, 
</p>
<p>and how uncertainty estimates should be properly interpreted. Additional guidance 
</p>
<p>and information on assessing uncertainty can also be found in EPA ( 1999 ) and in 
</p>
<p>IPCC ( 2000 ).

</p>
<p>3.4.3     How to Extend the Horizons Beyond Carbon? 
</p>
<p> We highlighted in Sect.  3.1.2  some of the reasons explaining why there is nowadays 
</p>
<p>a strong focus on carbon emissions. However, sustainability cannot be reduced to 
</p>
<p>carbon emissions. For example, water scarcity, its quality, and the regulations 
</p>
<p>affecting it are a growing business problem (The Economist  2014 ). Other environ-
</p>
<p>mental dimensions of sustainability as well as social impacts should not be over-
</p>
<p>looked because of too much focus on carbon emissions. We refer to Chap.   4     by 
</p>
<p>Hoekstra ( 2017 ) for more on water footprinting, to Chap.   5     by Blass et al. ( 2017 ) for 
</p>
<p>more on managing nonrenewable materials, and to Chaps.   20     and   21     by Lee 
</p>
<p>and Rammohan ( 2017 ) and Sodhi and Tang ( 2017 ) for more on socially responsible 
</p>
<p>supply chains. 
</p>
<p> The strong current focus on carbon emissions may be an opportunity for other 
</p>
<p>environmental indicators to be developed and adopted, in the sense that platforms 
</p>
<p>and accumulated experience related to carbon footprinting can be benefi cial. For 
</p>
<p>example, once acquainted with  environmental reporting   through carbon emissions, 
</p>
<p>a company may be more prone and able to develop an overall sustainability assess-
</p>
<p>ment. This trend is also refl ected by CDP&rsquo;s commitment to use the experience and 
</p>
<p>reputation obtained from carbon footprinting to develop new initiatives related to 
</p>
<p>water use and forest management. 
</p>
<p> One important observation here is that the capability developed through carbon 
</p>
<p>footprinting may not necessarily be directly transposed to other sustainability aspects. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, companies, non-governmental organizations, and governments need to take 
</p>
<p>into account that the other sustainability aspects might have different characteristics 
</p>
<p>than carbon emissions. For example, location and timing play a major role in water 
</p>
<p>footprinting, but not in carbon footprinting. Extending the  capabilities being built up 
</p>
<p>for carbon footprinting to other dimensions of sustainability presents an exciting 
</p>
<p>opportunity but one that should be approached thoughtfully.

<p> Water Footprint Assessment in Supply Chains

</p>
<p>4.1           Introduction 
</p>
<p> The World Economic Forum has listed water scarcity as one of the three global 
</p>
<p>systemic risks of highest concern, an assessment based on a broad global survey on 
</p>
<p>risk perception among representatives from business, academia, civil society, 
</p>
<p>governments and international organisations (WEF  2014 ). Freshwater scarcity 
</p>
<p>manifests itself in the form of declining groundwater tables, reduced river fl ows, 
</p>
<p>shrinking lakes and heavily polluted waters, but also in increasing costs of supply 
</p>
<p>and treatment, intermittent supplies and confl icts over water (Hoekstra  2014a ). 
</p>
<p>Future water scarcity will grow as a result of various drivers: population and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic growth, increased demands for animal products and biofuels and climate 
</p>
<p>change (Ercin and Hoekstra  2014 ). The private sector is becoming aware of the 
</p>
<p>problem of  freshwater scarcity   but is facing the challenge of formulating effective 
</p>
<p>responses. Even companies operating in water-abundant regions can be vulnerable 
</p>
<p>to water scarcity, because the supply chains of most companies stretch across the 
</p>
<p>globe. An estimated 22 % of global water consumption and pollution relates to the 
</p>
<p>production of export commodities (Hoekstra and Mekonnen  2012 ). Countries such 
</p>
<p>as the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, India and China are big virtual water 
</p>
<p>exporters, which means that they intensively use domestic water resources for pro-
</p>
<p>ducing export commodities. In contrast, countries in Europe, North Africa and the 
</p>
<p>Middle East as well as Mexico and Japan are dominated by virtual water import, 
</p>
<p>which means that they rely on import goods produced with water resources 
</p>
<p>elsewhere. The water use behind those imported goods is often not sustainable, 
</p>
<p>because many of the export regions overexploit their resources.

</p>
<p> Increasingly, companies start exploring their water footprint, thereby looking at 
</p>
<p>both their operations and supply chain. Key questions that industry leaders pose 
</p>
<p>themselves are as follows: where is my water footprint located, what risks does 
</p>
<p>water scarcity impose to my business, how sustainable is the water footprint in the 
</p>
<p>catchments where my operations and supply-chain processes are located, where and 
</p>
<p>how can water use effi ciency be increased and what is good water stewardship? The 
</p>
<p>demand for new sorts of data emerges, types of data that were usually not collected. 
</p>
<p>The focus shifts from relatively simple questions&mdash;whether the company has got 
</p>
<p>suffi cient water abstraction permits and whether wastewater disposal standards are 
</p>
<p>met&mdash;to the more pressing question: how the company actually contributes to the 
</p>
<p>overexploitation and pollution of water resources, not only through its own facilities 
</p>
<p>but through its supply chain as well. Having permits and meeting standards do not 
</p>
<p>imply sustainability. Most experience with collecting the new sorts of data 
</p>
<p>required and with addressing questions about good water stewardship is within 
</p>
<p>the food and beverage sector, which depends most clearly on water. In other 
</p>
<p>industries, the connection with water is not always clear, because it is indirect and 
</p>
<p>mostly through the supply chain. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the water 
</p>
<p>footprint concept, review experiences with water footprint assessment and refl ect 
</p>
<p>on future challenges. 
</p>
<p> In the next section, I will start with discussing and comparing three methods to 
</p>
<p>trace resource use and pollution over supply chains: environmental footprint assess-
</p>
<p>ment (EFA), life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmentally extended input&ndash;out-
</p>
<p>put analysis. Next, I will discuss what new perspective the water footprint concept 
</p>
<p>brings to the table, compared to the traditional way of looking at water use. In the 
</p>
<p>third section, I will refl ect on direct and indirect water footprints of the different 
</p>
<p>sectors of the economy, with examples for two specifi c sectors: food and beverage 
</p>
<p>and transport. In the last section, I will discuss future challenges, such as the issue 
</p>
<p>of data gathering and reporting, the demand for water stewardship and greater prod-
</p>
<p>uct transparency and the need to establish water footprint benchmarks.

<p> Three different methods have been developed to analyse direct and indirect natural 
</p>
<p>resource use and emissions in relation to products or economic  sectors  : EFA, LCA 
</p>
<p>and environmentally extended input&ndash;output analysis (EE-IOA). All three methods 
</p>
<p>have been applied also in the fi eld of water, to trace direct and indirect water use and 
</p>
<p>pollution over supply chains. Each of the three methods has its specifi c goal, approach 
</p>
<p>and focus, but there are commonalities across the methods as well. They all focus on

<p>67
</p>
<p>understanding natural resource use and emissions along supply or value chains. EFA 
</p>
<p>focuses on macro-questions on resource use sustainability, effi ciency, equitability 
</p>
<p>and security. LCA concentrates on the comparative analysis of environmental 
</p>
<p>impacts of products. EE-IOA focuses on understanding how natural resource use and 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts can be traced throughout the economy. 
</p>
<p> The fi eld  of    EFA   comprises methods to quantity and map land, water, material, 
</p>
<p>carbon and other environmental footprints and assess the sustainability of these 
</p>
<p>footprints as well as the effi ciency, equitability and security of resource use 
</p>
<p>(Hoekstra and Wiedmann  2014 ). Water footprint assessment (WFA) can be regarded 
</p>
<p>as a specifi c branch of this fi eld and refers to the full range of activities to quantify 
</p>
<p>and locate the water footprint of a process, product, producer or consumer or to 
</p>
<p>quantify in space and time the water footprint in a specifi ed geographic area; assess 
</p>
<p>the environmental sustainability, economic effi ciency and social equitability of 
</p>
<p>water footprints; and formulate a response strategy (Hoekstra et al.  2011 ). Broadly 
</p>
<p>speaking, the goal of assessing water footprints is to analyse how human activities 
</p>
<p>or specifi c products relate to issues of water scarcity and pollution and to see how 
</p>
<p>consumption, production, trade and specifi c products can become more sustainable 
</p>
<p>from a water perspective. 
</p>
<p>  LCA      is a method for estimating  and   assessing the environmental impacts attrib-
</p>
<p>utable to the life cycle of a product, such as climate change; stratospheric ozone 
</p>
<p>depletion; tropospheric ozone (smog) creation; eutrophication; acidifi cation; toxi-
</p>
<p>cological stress on human health and ecosystems; the depletion of resources, water 
</p>
<p>use, land use and noise; and others (Rebitzer et al.  2004 ). The assessment includes 
</p>
<p>all stages of the life cycle of a product, from cradle to grave (from material extrac-
</p>
<p>tion to returning of wastes to nature). An LCA study includes four phases: setting 
</p>
<p>goal and scope, inventory accounting, impact assessment and interpretation. Water 
</p>
<p>use and pollution can be considered as specifi c impact categories within LCA 
</p>
<p>(Kounina et al.  2013 ). LCA focuses on  comparing  the environmental impacts of 
</p>
<p>alternative processes, materials, products or designs. (See Chap.   2     by Guin&eacute;e and 
</p>
<p>Heijungs ( 2017 ) for more on LCA.) 
</p>
<p> Environmentally extended input&ndash;output analysis ( EE-IOA  )    is a method for 
</p>
<p>studying the relation between different sectors of the economy and indirect natural 
</p>
<p>resource use and environmental impacts. It combines the classical monetary input&ndash;
</p>
<p>output formalism with satellite accounts containing data on resource use and emis-
</p>
<p>sions into the environment. Over the past decade, we have seen quite a number of 
</p>
<p>applications of EE- IOA   to analyse &lsquo;embodied&rsquo; water fl ows through the economy 
</p>
<p>(Daniels et al.  2011 ). Applications have been carried out, for example, for Australia 
</p>
<p>(Lenzen and Foran  2001 ), Spain (Duarte et al.  2002 ; Cazcarro et al.  2013 ), the UK 
</p>
<p>(Yu et al.  2010 ; Feng et al.  2011a ), China (Zhao et al.  2009 ; Zhang and Anadon 
</p>
<p> 2014 ) and the city of Beijing (Zhang et al.  2011 ).  Input&ndash;output models   basically 
</p>
<p>show monetary fl ows between sectors within the economy; environmentally 
</p>
<p>extended input&ndash;output models usually express water use in terms of litre per dollar 
</p>
<p>(or other currencies). Most environmentally extended input&ndash;output models also 
</p>
<p>have some form of accounting of product fl ows in physical units, but due to the 
</p>
<p>aggregation of specifi c economic activities into sectors, it remains diffi cult to reach

<p>the same high level of detail as achieved in a process-based WFA or LCA. Both 
</p>
<p>WFA and LCA enable an analysis of water use in all processes of the value chain 
</p>
<p>and attribution of the water use along value chains to specifi c products. A promising 
</p>
<p>path in this respect is the method of so-called  hybrid  environmentally extended 
</p>
<p> input&ndash;output modelling  , in which physical fl ows are integrated into the model 
</p>
<p>(Ewing et al.  2012 ; Steen-Olsen et al.  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> Process-based WFA and LCA are generally constrained by the fact that parts of 
</p>
<p>the value chain have to be left out from the analysis for practical reasons. This prob-
</p>
<p>lem does not occur in input&ndash;output modelling. Therefore, there is a development to 
</p>
<p>enhance process-based WFA and LCA with the advantage of input&ndash;output model-
</p>
<p>ling. In the case of LCA, this results in the so-called  hybrid LCA approach   
</p>
<p>(Finnveden et al.  2009 ). In hybrid LCA, the environmental impacts of fl ows that 
</p>
<p>were not included in the process-based LCA are estimated with an environmentally 
</p>
<p>extended input&ndash;output model. This hybrid approach is also called environmental 
</p>
<p>input&ndash;output-based LCA (EIO-LCA). In the case of WFA, a similar development 
</p>
<p>can be expected (Feng et al.  2011b ). 
</p>
<p> The difference between EFA and LCA is the focus on sustainability of produc-
</p>
<p>tion and consumption at macro-level of the former and the focus on comparing 
</p>
<p>environmental impact at process and product level of the latter (Hoekstra  2015b ). 
</p>
<p>This is explained in Box  4.1  for the example of cutting trees. Typical questions in 
</p>
<p>EFA studies relate to how different processes and products contribute to the overall 
</p>
<p>footprints at larger scales, how different consumption patterns infl uence the overall 
</p>
<p>footprint, whether footprints at the larger scales remain within their maximum sus-
</p>
<p>tainable levels, how footprints can be reduced by better technology, whether differ-
</p>
<p>ent people have equitable shares in the total footprint of humanity and what 
</p>
<p>externalisation of footprints may imply for resource security (Hoekstra and 
</p>
<p>Wiedmann  2014 ). LCA is designed to compare the environmental impact of one 
</p>
<p>product over its full value chain with the overall impact of another product or to 
</p>
<p>compare the differences in environmental impact between different product designs 
</p>
<p>or alternative production processes. 
</p>
<p>  Box 4.1 The  Sustainability   of Cutting Trees: The Fundamental Difference 
</p>
<p>Between LCA and EFA 
</p>
<p> Is it sustainable to cut a tree? Although a relevant question, it is impossible to 
</p>
<p>answer this question in isolated form. On the one hand, it is hard to argue that 
</p>
<p>cutting just one tree is not sustainable. After a tree has been cut, a new one 
</p>
<p>will grow, so that is sustainable. On the other hand, if one takes this insight on 
</p>
<p>the sustainability of cutting one tree to conclude that one can cut all forests, 
</p>
<p>one cannot maintain that this is sustainable. The reason why answering a sim-
</p>
<p>ple question like this tree-cutting question causes a fundamental problem is 
</p>
<p>that sustainability is a concept that cannot be applied at the level of single

</p>
<p>  At the level of basic data, EFA and LCA require similar data.  The   data collection 
</p>
<p>and analysis required in the accounting stage of a product-focused WFA (as opposed 
</p>
<p>to a geographic- or consumption-focused WFA) are very much similar to what is 
</p>
<p>needed in the inventory stage of a water-focused LCA (Boulay et al.  2013 ). 
</p>
<p> EFA, LCA and EE-IOA are not static analytical methods, but still young fi elds 
</p>
<p>under development. We can observe a development in the past few years in which a 
</p>
<p>Box 4.1 (continued)
</p>
<p>activities, but only at the level of a system as a whole. Still, there is a strong 
</p>
<p>wish among people to measure the sustainability of single activities, because 
</p>
<p>individuals undertake single activities and consume goods and services that 
</p>
<p>relate to series of single activities to produce them. The methods of LCA and 
</p>
<p>EFA deal with this problem in fundamentally different ways. In LCA, the 
</p>
<p>approach is to leave the larger question on sustainability and look at  compara-
</p>
<p>tive  contributions of different activities to natural resource appropriation, 
</p>
<p>emissions and potential impacts at the larger scale. In other words, LCA 
</p>
<p>addresses the question how cutting one tree compares to cutting two trees, a 
</p>
<p>question that is not hard to answer. In EFA, the approach is to estimate human-
</p>
<p>ity&rsquo;s total natural resource appropriation and emissions and compare that to 
</p>
<p>the Earth&rsquo;s carrying or assimilation capacity. Both methods struggle in a simi-
</p>
<p>lar way with how to compare apples and pears, for example, how to compare 
</p>
<p>cutting trees with polluting water. The approach in LCA is to  weigh  different 
</p>
<p>types of primary resource use or emissions according to their potential fi nal 
</p>
<p>impact on human health and ecosystem health. The approach in EFA is to 
</p>
<p>compare the different types of resource use and pollution to their respective 
</p>
<p>maximum sustainable levels. The great similarity between LCA and EFA is 
</p>
<p>that resource use and emissions are analysed per process (activity) and per 
</p>
<p>product (by analysing the processes along supply chains). The difference 
</p>
<p>comes when LCA starts weighing different types of resource use and emis-
</p>
<p>sions based on their potential impact and comparing alternative processes or 
</p>
<p>products according to their overall potential environmental impact. In con-
</p>
<p>trast, EFA adds the resource use and emissions of different activities in order 
</p>
<p>to get a complete picture, analyse the sustainability of the whole and study the 
</p>
<p>relative contribution of different processes, products and consumers to the 
</p>
<p>total. In many applications, though, the difference between LCA and EFA is 
</p>
<p>not so clear. By comparing the footprints of two different processes or prod-
</p>
<p>ucts, EFA also allows for comparative analysis. However, the comparative 
</p>
<p>analysis is partial in this case, because different footprints are not weighted 
</p>
<p>and added to get a measure of &lsquo;overall potential environmental impact&rsquo;. On 
</p>
<p>the other hand, one can also extend an LCA from comparing products to com-
</p>
<p>paring consumption patterns, which is at the larger scale typically for 
</p>
<p>EFA. The fundamental difference  between   LCA and EFA in the way they treat 
</p>
<p>the tree-cutting question, however, remains.

</p>
<p>fruitful exchange between the three fi elds leads to the adoption of approaches from 
</p>
<p>one fi eld into the other. In EFA studies we have seen the adoption of life cycle 
</p>
<p>accounting procedures from LCA and the exploration of  using   input&ndash;output models 
</p>
<p>to calculate national and sector footprints, in addition to the already existing bot-
</p>
<p>tom- up and top-down trade-balance approaches. In LCA we recently observe, fed 
</p>
<p>by experiences in EFA, an interest to develop methods to carry out an LCA for a 
</p>
<p>whole organisation instead of for a product and to carry out LCAs for consumer 
</p>
<p>lifestyles or for national consumption as a whole (Hellweg and Mil&agrave; i Canals  2014 ). 
</p>
<p>Additionally, based on experiences in EE-IOA, the LCA community is exploring 
</p>
<p>hybrid LCA methods as already mentioned above. The EE-IOA practice improves 
</p>
<p>in the direction  of   hybrid methods that include physical accounting and have greater 
</p>
<p>granularity in the analysis, fed by the practices in the EFA and LCA fi elds. This 
</p>
<p>mutual enrichment and to some extent convergence of approaches do not imply that 
</p>
<p>the three methods will grow into one. They may develop into a more consistent 
</p>
<p>framework of coherent methods, but the fact that different sorts of questions will 
</p>
<p>remain implies that different approaches will continue to be necessary. 
</p>
<p> All three methods&mdash;EFA, LCA and EE-IOA&mdash;have a focus on environmental 
</p>
<p>issues, leaving out social issues (like labour conditions, human rights). Principally, 
</p>
<p>though, there is nothing that necessarily restricts the methods to environmental 
</p>
<p>issues. Broadly speaking, one can trace all sorts of process characteristics along 
</p>
<p>supply chains. The oldest forms of accounting along supply chains are the account-
</p>
<p>ing of monetary added value and the accounting of material fl ows and energy use 
</p>
<p>along supply chains. Material fl ow analysis (MFA) or substance fl ow analysis (SFA) 
</p>
<p>aims at the quantifi cation of stocks and fl ows of materials or substances in a well- 
</p>
<p>defi ned system, drawing mass balances for each subsystem and the system as a 
</p>
<p>whole.  Energy fl ow analysis   aims at quantifying the energy content of fl ows within 
</p>
<p>an economy. The innovation of EFA, LCA and EE-IOA lies in the attribution of 
</p>
<p>resource use, emissions or impacts along supply chains to products and fi nal con-
</p>
<p>sumption. In this context, one speaks about the embodied, embedded, indirect or 
</p>
<p>virtual land, water and energy in a product or consumption pattern, the indirect 
</p>
<p>emissions, etc. When doing so, the method of EE-IOA is linked to traditional eco-
</p>
<p>nomic accounting, which is a strong point of this method. The methods of EFA and 
</p>
<p>LCA are rather linked to physical accounting, which is their strength. In all three 
</p>
<p>fi elds, we observe efforts to enhance the methods and broaden the scope, with an 
</p>
<p>increasing number of hybrid approaches.  
</p>
<p>4.2.2     The Water Footprint Concept 
</p>
<p> The water footprint (WF) is a measure of freshwater appropriation underlying a 
</p>
<p>certain product or consumption pattern. Three  components   are distinguished: the 
</p>
<p>blue, green and grey WF (Hoekstra et al.  2011 ). The blue WF measures the volume 
</p>
<p>of water abstracted from the ground or surface water system minus the volume of 
</p>
<p>water returned to the system. It thus refers to the sum of the water fl ow that 
</p>
<p>A.Y. Hoekstra</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>71
</p>
<p>evaporates during the process of production, the water incorporated into a product 
</p>
<p>and the water released in another catchment. The blue WF differs from the conven-
</p>
<p>tional way of measuring freshwater use by looking at net rather than gross water 
</p>
<p>withdrawal. This is done because it makes more sense to look at net water with-
</p>
<p>drawal if one is interested in the effect of water use on water scarcity within a catch-
</p>
<p>ment. Return fl ows can be reused within the catchment, unlike the water fl ow that 
</p>
<p>evaporates or is captured within a product. The green WF refers to the volume of 
</p>
<p>rainwater consumed in a production process. This is particularly relevant in agricul-
</p>
<p>ture and forestry, where it refers to the total rainwater evapotranspiration (from 
</p>
<p>fi elds and plantations) plus the water incorporated into the harvested crop or wood. 
</p>
<p>The grey WF is an indicator of freshwater pollution and defi ned as the volume of 
</p>
<p>freshwater required to assimilate a load of pollutants based on natural background 
</p>
<p>concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards. The  advantage   of 
</p>
<p>expressing water pollution in terms of the water volume required for assimilating 
</p>
<p>the pollutants, rather than in terms of concentrations of contaminants, is that this 
</p>
<p>brings water pollution into the same unit as consumptive use. In this way, the use of 
</p>
<p>water as a drain and the use of water as a resource, two competing uses, become 
</p>
<p>comparable. The WF refers thus to both consumptive water use (of rainwater&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>green WF&mdash;and of surface and groundwater&mdash;the blue WF) and degenerative or 
</p>
<p>degradative water use (the grey WF). 
</p>
<p> As a measure of freshwater use, the WF differs from the classical measure of 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;water withdrawal&rsquo; in several ways. The term &lsquo;water  withdrawal&rsquo;  &mdash;also called 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;water abstraction&rsquo; or often simply &lsquo;water use&rsquo;&mdash;refers to the extraction of water 
</p>
<p>from the groundwater or a surface water body like a river, lake or artifi cial storage 
</p>
<p>reservoir. It thus refers to what we call  blue  water use. The WF is not restricted to 
</p>
<p>measuring blue water use, but also measures the use of green water resources 
</p>
<p>(the green WF) and the volume of pollution (the grey WF). Another difference 
</p>
<p>between the WF and the classical way of measuring water use was mentioned 
</p>
<p>already above: the classical measure of &lsquo;water use&rsquo; always refers to gross blue water 
</p>
<p>abstraction, while the blue WF refers to net blue water abstraction. Another differ-
</p>
<p>ence between the classical way of measuring water use and the WF is that the latter 
</p>
<p>concept can be used to measure water use over supply chains. When we talk about 
</p>
<p>the WF of a product, we refer to the water consumption and pollution in all stages 
</p>
<p>of the supply chain of the product. When we speak about the WF of a producer or a 
</p>
<p>consumer, we refer to the full WF of all the products produced or consumed. 
</p>
<p> The WF thus offers a wider perspective on how a product, producer or consumer 
</p>
<p>relates to the use of freshwater systems. It is a volumetric measure of water 
</p>
<p> consumption and pollution. WF accounts give spatiotemporally explicit informa-
</p>
<p>tion on how water is appropriated for various human purposes. The local environ-
</p>
<p>mental impact of a certain amount of  water   consumption and pollution depends on 
</p>
<p>the vulnerability of the local water system and the number of water consumers and 
</p>
<p>polluters that make use of the same system. The WF within a catchment needs to be 
</p>
<p>compared to the maximum sustainable WF in the catchment in order to understand 
</p>
<p>the sustainability of water use. The WF of a specifi c process or product needs to be 
</p>
<p>compared to a WF benchmark based on best available technology and practice in 
</p>
<p>4 Water Footprint Assessment in Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72
</p>
<p>order to understand the effi ciency of water use. The WF per capita for a community 
</p>
<p>can be compared to the WF of other communities to understand the degree of equi-
</p>
<p>table sharing of limited water resources. WF accounts can thus feed the discussion 
</p>
<p>about the sustainability, effi ciency and equitability of water use and allocation 
</p>
<p>(Hoekstra  2013 ,  2014b ). 
</p>
<p> The defi nition of  the   green and blue WF can best be understood by considering 
</p>
<p>the water balance of a river basin (Fig.  4.1 ). The total annual water availability in a 
</p>
<p>catchment area is given by the annual volume of precipitation, which will leave the 
</p>
<p>basin partly through evapotranspiration and partly through runoff to the sea. Both the 
</p>
<p>evaporative fl ow and the runoff can be appropriated by humans. The green WF refers 
</p>
<p>to the human use of the evaporative fl ow from the land surface, mostly for growing 
</p>
<p>crops or production forest. The blue WF refers to the consumptive use of the runoff 
</p>
<p>fl ow, i.e. the net abstraction of runoff from the catchment. The term &lsquo;water consump-
</p>
<p>tion&rsquo; can be confusing, because many people&mdash;particularly those not aware of the big 
</p>
<p>difference between gross and net water abstraction&mdash;use the term for gross water 
</p>
<p>abstraction. Specialists, though, defi ne water consumption as net blue water 
</p>
<p>abstraction (gross abstraction minus return fl ow). Evaporation is generally consid-
</p>
<p>ered as a loss to the catchment. Even though evaporated water will always return in 
</p>
<p>the form of precipitation at global scale, this will not alleviate the water scarcity in 
</p>
<p>the catchment in the period that the river is emptied due to net water abstractions. 
</p>
<p>Moisture recycling at smaller spatial scales is generally only modest.
</p>
<p>   The defi nition of the grey WF is clarifi ed in Fig.  4.2 . The basis for the calculation 
</p>
<p>is the anthropogenic load of a substance into a freshwater body (groundwater, river, 
</p>
<p>lake), that is, the additional load caused by a human activity (e.g. a production 
</p>
<p>process). We should acknowledge that the effl uent from an industry might contain 
</p>
<p>certain amounts of chemicals that were already in the water abstracted. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>we should look at the  additional  load to a freshwater body as a result of a certain 
</p>
<p>activity. Furthermore, we should look at the load of a substance that really enters the 
</p>
<p>river, lake or groundwater, which means that, if an effl uent is treated before disposal, 
</p>
<p>we have to consider the load of chemicals in the effl uent that remains  after  treatment.

</p>
<p>The critical load in a freshwater body is defi ned as the difference between the 
</p>
<p>maximum acceptable and natural concentration of a chemical for the receiving 
</p>
<p>water body times the renewal rate of the freshwater body. Note that as for the maxi-
</p>
<p>mum allowable concentration, we have to take the ambient water quality standard 
</p>
<p>for the receiving freshwater body, not the effl uent standard (Franke et al.  2013 ). 
</p>
<p>In a river, the renewal rate is equal to runoff; in a groundwater reservoir, the renewal 
</p>
<p>rate is equal to groundwater recharge, which (over the longer term) is the same as 
</p>
<p>groundwater runoff. In a lake, the renewal rate equals the fl ow through the lake. The 
</p>
<p>grey WF is calculated as the pollutant load to a freshwater body divided by the criti-
</p>
<p>cal load, times the renewal rate of that freshwater body. Defi ned in this way, it 
</p>
<p>means that when the grey WF onto a freshwater body becomes as big as the renewal 
</p>
<p>rate of this freshwater body, the assimilation capacity has been fully used. When the 
</p>
<p>size of the grey WF in a catchment exceeds the size of runoff from this catch-
</p>
<p>ment, pollution is bigger than the assimilation capacity, resulting in a violation of 
</p>
<p>the maximum acceptable concentration. When an effl uent contains different sorts of 
</p>
<p>pollutants, as is usually the case, the grey WF is determined by the pollutant that is 
</p>
<p>most critical, that is the one that gives the largest pollutant-specifi c grey WF. Thermal 
</p>
<p>pollution can be dealt with in a similar way as pollutants, whereby the load consists 
</p>
<p>of heat and the assimilation capacity depends on the accepted temperature increase 
</p>
<p>of the receiving water body (Hoekstra et al.  2011 ).

<p>4.3.1     The Importance of Water Use in the Primary Sector 
</p>
<p> Usually, economic activities are categorised into three different sectors. The  primary 
</p>
<p>sector   of the economy, the sector that extracts or harvests products from the earth, 
</p>
<p>has the largest water footprint on Earth. This sector includes activities like 
</p>
<p>Process
</p>
<p>Load = Out - In
</p>
<p>Substance intake
</p>
<p>In = Water abstraction volume &times; cact
</p>
<p>Substance output 
</p>
<p>Out = Effluent volume &times; ceffl
</p>
<p>Freshwater body
</p>
<p>Critical load = Renewal rate &times; (cmax - cnat) 
</p>
<p>Grey water footprint = (Load / Critical load) &times; Renewal rate

<p>agriculture, forestry, fi shing, aquaculture, mining and quarrying. The green WF of 
</p>
<p>humanity is nearly entirely concentrated within the primary sector. It has been 
</p>
<p>estimated that about 92 % of the blue WF of humanity is just in agriculture alone 
</p>
<p>(Table  4.1 ).
</p>
<p>   The secondary sector covers the manufacturing of goods in the economy, includ-
</p>
<p>ing the processing of materials produced by the primary sector. It also includes 
</p>
<p>construction and the public utility industries of electricity, gas and water. Sometimes, 
</p>
<p>the public utility industries are also mentioned under the tertiary (service) sector, 
</p>
<p>because they do not only produce something (electricity, gas, purifi ed water), but 
</p>
<p>also supply it to customers (as a service). Water utilities could even partly fall under 
</p>
<p>the primary sector, because part of the activity is the abstraction of water from the 
</p>
<p>environment (rivers, lakes, groundwater). The work of water utilities comprises

</p>
<p>water collection, purifi cation, distribution and supply, wastewater collection 
</p>
<p>(sewerage), wastewater treatment, material recovery and wastewater disposal. It&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>rather common to categorise the whole water utility sector under the secondary 
</p>
<p>sector. The tertiary industry is the service industry and covers services to both busi-
</p>
<p>nesses and fi nal consumers. This sector includes activities like retail and wholesale 
</p>
<p>sales, transportation and distribution, entertainment, restaurants, clerical services, 
</p>
<p>media, tourism, insurance, banking, healthcare, defence and law. Even though 
</p>
<p>sometimes categorised into another, quaternary sector, one can also list here activi-
</p>
<p>ties related to government, culture, libraries, scientifi c research, education and 
</p>
<p>information technology. The secondary and tertiary sectors have much smaller WFs 
</p>
<p>than the primary sector. 
</p>
<p> The contribution of agriculture to water scarcity is underestimated by conven-
</p>
<p>tional water use statistics, which show gross blue water abstractions. In agriculture, 
</p>
<p>most of the gross water use will evaporate from storage reservoirs, irrigations canals 
</p>
<p>or fi nally from the fi eld. The water abstracted for irrigation in agriculture is thus 
</p>
<p>largely unavailable for reuse within the basin. In industrial water use, the ratio of net 
</p>
<p>to gross abstraction is estimated at less than 5 %. In municipal water use, this ratio 
</p>
<p>varies from 5 to 15 % in urban areas and from 10 to 50 % in rural areas (FAO  2014 ). 
</p>
<p>Water that returns to the catchment after use can be reused. Presenting gross or net 
</p>
<p>water abstractions thus makes a huge difference for industries and households and 
</p>
<p>less in agriculture. 
</p>
<p> Even though the primary sector is the largest water user, governmental pro-
</p>
<p>grammes to create public awareness of water scarcity often focus on public cam-
</p>
<p>paigns calling for water saving at home. This is little effective at large given the fact 
</p>
<p>that the major share of water use in most places relates to agriculture and in second 
</p>
<p>instance to industry. Water scarcity is thus generally caused mostly by excessive 
</p>
<p>water use in agriculture. Installing water-saving showerheads and dual-fl ush toilets 
</p>
<p>in households will have hardly any impact in mitigating water scarcity at all, but still 
</p>
<p>this is what most water-saving campaigns advocate for. It would be more useful to 
</p>
<p> make   people aware of the water use and pollution underlying the food items and 
</p>
<p>other products they buy and to advocate for product labels that show the sustain-
</p>
<p>ability of the WF of a product.  
</p>
<p>4.3.2     Food and Beverage Products 
</p>
<p> The food and beverage  sector   is the manufacturing sector with the largest WF, 
</p>
<p>maybe not the largest operational WF, but defi nitely the largest supply-chain WF. 
</p>
<p>(Chap.   18     by Bloemhof and Soysal ( 2017 ) focuses on designing sustainable food 
</p>
<p>supply chains.) The reason is that the food and beverage sector is the largest client 
</p>
<p>of  the   agricultural sector, which is responsible for the largest share in global water 
</p>
<p>consumption (Table  4.1 ). Interesting WF studies carried out in the beverage sector 
</p>
<p>are, for example, the studies carried out by SABMiller (SABMiller and WWF-UK 
</p>
<p> 2009 ; SABMiller et al.  2010 ), Coca-Cola (TCCC and TNC  2010 ; Coca-Cola

<p>Europe  2011 ) and the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable (BIER  2011 ). 
</p>
<p>Some nice examples of WF studies in the food sector come from Unilever 
</p>
<p>(Jefferies et al.  2012 ), Dole (Sikirica  2011 ), Mars (Ridoutt et al.  2009 ) and Barilla 
</p>
<p>(Ruini et al.  2013 ). 
</p>
<p> Traditionally, the beverage industry focuses on the so-called water use ratio 
</p>
<p>( WUR  )   , which is defi ned as the total water use divided by the total production at a 
</p>
<p>bottling facility, expressed in terms of litre of water used per litre of beverage pro-
</p>
<p>duced. Water use stands here for gross blue water abstraction, not net blue water 
</p>
<p>abstraction (blue WF). In a global benchmarking study for the period 2009&ndash;2011, 
</p>
<p>BIER ( 2012 ) reports a WUR of 1.2&ndash;2.2 L/L (with an average of 1.5) for bottled 
</p>
<p>water, a WUR of 1.5&ndash;4.0 (average 2.1) for carbonated soft drinks, a WUR of 3.2&ndash;
</p>
<p>6.6 (average 4.3) for beer breweries, a WUR of 8&ndash;126 (average 36) for distilleries 
</p>
<p>and a WUR of 2.0&ndash;18.5 (average 4.4) for wineries. The WUR is of limited value, 
</p>
<p>because the operational WF of bottling factories is very small when compared to the 
</p>
<p>full WF of a beverage, as shown by Ercin et al. ( 2011 ) for a carbonated soft drink. 
</p>
<p>They show that the WF of a half-litre bottle of soft drink resembling cola can range 
</p>
<p> between   150 and 300 L, of which 99.7&ndash;99.8 % refers to the supply chain.  
</p>
<p>4.3.3     Transport 
</p>
<p>  Transport is   always considered as an important sector in carbon footprint assess-
</p>
<p>ment, since transport can signifi cantly contribute to the overall carbon footprint of a 
</p>
<p>fi nal product, measured over its full supply chain. In the case of the WF of a fi nal 
</p>
<p>product, the contribution of transport will generally be relatively small, because not 
</p>
<p>much freshwater is being consumed or polluted during transport. It is worth consid-
</p>
<p>ering the indirect WF of transport related to materials (trucks, trains, boats, 
</p>
<p>airplanes) and energy used, but particularly materials will generally contribute very 
</p>
<p>little, due to the fact that the WF of transport vehicles can be distributed over all 
</p>
<p>goods transported over the lifetime of a vehicle. The WF of energy may be more 
</p>
<p>relevant, but even that can be small compared to the other components of the WF of 
</p>
<p>goods, particularly in the case of agricultural goods. The key determinant in the WF 
</p>
<p>of transport is probably the energy source (Gerbens-Leenes et al.  2009a ; King and 
</p>
<p>Webber  2008 ). The WF of bioenergy in terms of cubic metre per GJ is generally two 
</p>
<p>to three orders of magnitude larger than that for energy from fossil fuels or wind or 
</p>
<p>solar power. However, in all energy categories, WFs per unit of energy can widely 
</p>
<p>vary, depending on the precise source and production technology. The technique of 
</p>
<p>hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to mine natural gas or petroleum reserves, for 
</p>
<p>example, has a larger blue and grey WF than when mining reserves that are easier 
</p>
<p>accessible using more conventional techniques. In the case of bioenergy, it matters 
</p>
<p>greatly whether one speaks about biodiesel from oil crops, bioethanol from sugar or 
</p>
<p>starch crops (Gerbens-Leenes et al.  2009b ; Dominguez-Faus et al.  2009 ), biofuel 
</p>
<p>from cellulosic fractions of crops or waste materials (Chiu and Wu  2012 ), biofuel 
</p>
<p>from algae (Gerbens-Leenes et al.  2014 ) or about bioelectricity. In the latter case, 
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>77
</p>
<p>it makes a large difference what is burnt: biomass grown for the purpose or organic 
</p>
<p>waste. As an illustration of the large differences between different bioenergy forms, 
</p>
<p>Table  4.2  shows the WF of different modes of  passenger   and freight transport when 
</p>
<p>based on fi rst-generation biofuel produced in the European Union. Governmental 
</p>
<p>policies to replace substantial percentages of fossil fuels by biofuels will lead to a 
</p>
<p>rapid growth of the WF of the transport sector (Gerbens-Leenes et al.  2012 ).
</p>
<p>4.4         Challenges 
</p>
<p>4.4.1     The Need to Take a Supply-Chain Perspective 
</p>
<p> The supply-chain WF of  most   companies is many times greater than their operational 
</p>
<p>footprint, but most companies restrict their efforts to reducing the latter, leaving the 
</p>
<p>supply-chain WF out of scope. Studies carried out by companies like Coca-Cola, 
</p>
<p>PepsiCo, SABMiller and Heineken have shown that the supply-chain WF for bever-
</p>
<p>age companies can easily be over 99 % of their total WF. Nevertheless, all these 
</p>
<p>companies apply a &lsquo;key performance indicator&rsquo; for water that refers to the water use 
</p>
<p>in their own operations only. Common reduction targets in the beverage industry,

</p>
<p>such as going from 2 to 1.5 L of water use in the bottling plant per litre of beverage, 
</p>
<p>have little effect on the larger scale given that the supply-chain WF of most bever-
</p>
<p>ages is of the order of 100 L of water per litre of beverage or even more (Hoekstra 
</p>
<p> 2013 ). Water-sustainability investments by beverage companies are geared to better 
</p>
<p>perform in their own operations, which means that investments are made that aim to 
</p>
<p>reduce that one per cent of their total WF. It is diffi cult to imagine that these invest-
</p>
<p>ments will be most cost effective if really sustainability is the goal. Incorporating 
</p>
<p>sustainability principles into a company&rsquo;s business model would include the adoption 
</p>
<p>of mechanisms to secure sustainable water use in the supply chain. For companies, 
</p>
<p>moving towards a sustainable supply chain is a much bigger challenge than green-
</p>
<p>ing their own operations, because the WF of the supply chain can be infl uenced only 
</p>
<p>indirectly. Mechanisms to reduce the supply-chain WF are, for example,    the appli-
</p>
<p>cation of water criteria for sustainable procurement and reaching agreements with 
</p>
<p>suppliers about footprint reduction over time.  
</p>
<p>4.4.2     The Need to Incorporate Temporal and Spatial 
</p>
<p>Variability in Water Footprint Assessment 
</p>
<p> When formulating WF  reduction   targets for processes in their operations or supply 
</p>
<p>chain, companies should not only look at the numbers but also at the geographic 
</p>
<p>locations where their WF is sited. Priority is to be given to WF reduction in catch-
</p>
<p>ments in which the overall footprint exceeds the carrying capacity or assimilation 
</p>
<p>capacity of the catchment. It has been argued that reduction in water-abundant 
</p>
<p>catchments does not even make sense (Pfi ster and Hellweg  2009 ), but this is based 
</p>
<p>on a misunderstanding. Since the WF (m 3 /product unit) is simply a reverse of water 
</p>
<p>productivity (product units per m 3 ), it is diffi cult to see why one would not set tar-
</p>
<p>gets regarding the reduction of the WF of a product, which is the same as setting 
</p>
<p>targets regarding the increase of water productivity. The relevance of increased 
</p>
<p>water productivities worldwide, also in water-abundant places, can be illustrated 
</p>
<p>with the following example (Hoekstra  2013 ). Suppose the hypothetical case of two 
</p>
<p>river basins, with the same surface (Table  4.3 ). Basin A is relatively dry and has, on 
</p>

</p>
<p>an annual basis, 50 water units available, the maximum sustainable WF. The maximum 
</p>
<p>level, however, is exceeded by a factor of two. Farmers in the basin consume 100 
</p>
<p>water units per year to produce 100 crop units. Basin B has more water available, 
</p>
<p>250 water units per year. Water is more abundant than in the fi rst basin, but water is 
</p>
<p>used less effi ciently. Farmers in the basin consume 200 water units per year, to pro-
</p>
<p>duce 100 crop units, the same amount as in the fi rst basin, but using two times more 
</p>
<p>water per crop unit. A geographic analysis shows that in basin B, the WF (200) 
</p>
<p>remains below the maximum level (250), so this is sustainable. In basin A, however, 
</p>
<p>the WF (100) by far exceeds the maximum sustainable level (50), so this is clearly 
</p>
<p>unsustainable. The question is now: should we categorise the crops originating from 
</p>
<p>basin A as unsustainable and the crops from basin B as sustainable? From a geo-
</p>
<p>graphic perspective, the answer is affi rmative. In basin A, the WF of crop produc-
</p>
<p>tion needs to be reduced that seems to be the crux. However, when we take a product 
</p>
<p>perspective, we observe that the WF per crop unit in basin B is two times larger than 
</p>
<p>in basin A. If the farmers in basin B would use their water more productively and 
</p>
<p>reach the same water productivity as in basin A, they would produce twice as many 
</p>
<p>crops without increasing the total WF in the basin. It may well be that farmers in 
</p>
<p>basin A cannot easily further increase their water productivity, so that&mdash;if the aim is 
</p>
<p>to keep global production at the same level&mdash;the only solution is to bring down the 
</p>
<p>WF in basin A to a sustainable level by cutting  production   by half, while enlarging 
</p>
<p>production in basin B by increasing the water productivity. If basin B manages to 
</p>
<p>achieve the same water productivity level as in basin A, the two basins together 
</p>
<p>could even increase global production while halving the total WF in basin A and 
</p>
<p>keeping it at the same level in basin B.
</p>
<p>4.4.3        Measuring and Reporting 
</p>
<p> It is diffi cult to  get   water use statistics organised along the same structure of eco-
</p>
<p>nomic sector classifi cations. Many countries and regions have their own classifi ca-
</p>
<p>tion of economic activities, distinguishing main sectors, subsectors, etc. One of the 
</p>
<p>international standard classifi cations is the Industrial Classifi cation of All Economic 
</p>
<p>Activities of the United Nations (UN  2008 ). Conventional water use statistics 
</p>
<p>mostly show gross blue water withdrawals and distinguish three main categories: 
</p>
<p>agricultural, industrial and municipal water use (FAO  2014 ). Also WF statistics 
</p>
<p>distinguish between the agricultural, industrial and municipal sector. These three 
</p>
<p>sectors cannot be mapped one to one onto the primary, secondary and tertiary sector. 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Agricultural water use&rsquo; obviously is about water use in the primary sector, while 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;industrial water use&rsquo; is about water use in the secondary sector. However, water use 
</p>
<p>in mining&mdash;part of the primary sector&mdash;will generally be categorised under &lsquo;indus-
</p>
<p>trial water use&rsquo; as well. Industrial water use refers to self-supplied industries not 
</p>
<p>connected to the public distribution network. It includes water for the cooling of 
</p>
<p>thermoelectric plants, but it does not include hydropower (which is often left out of 
</p>
<p>the water use accounts altogether). Municipal water use&mdash;often alternatively called 
</p>
<p>domestic water use or public water supply&mdash;refers to the water use by water utilities 
</p>

<p/>

<p>80
</p>
<p>and distributed through the public water distribution network. Water utilities provide 
</p>
<p>water directly to households, but also to water users in the primary, secondary and 
</p>
<p>tertiary sector. 
</p>
<p> The mismatch between the  three   main categories in water use statistics and the 
</p>
<p>different sectors as usually distinguished in the economy can be quite confusing. 
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;water supply sector&rsquo; as distinguished in economic classifi cations refers to 
</p>
<p>water utilities delivering municipal water to households and others connected to the 
</p>
<p>public water supply system. Unfortunately, the category of municipal water use 
</p>
<p>lumps water use for a great variety of water users: fi nal consumers (households) and 
</p>
<p>users in all economic sectors. Specifi cations by type of user are not always avail-
</p>
<p>able. Additionally confusing is that, even though the &lsquo;water supply sector&rsquo; serves all 
</p>
<p>sorts of users, the sector refers to only a minor fraction of total water use. Most of 
</p>
<p>the water use in agriculture, the largest water user, is not part of the &lsquo;water supply 
</p>
<p>sector&rsquo;. Furthermore, water self-supply by industries does not fall within this sector 
</p>
<p>and neither does self-supply in the tertiary sector and self-supply by fi nal consum-
</p>
<p>ers. Given that only an estimated 3.6 % of the total WF of humanity relates to what 
</p>
<p>we call the &lsquo;water supply sector&rsquo; (Hoekstra and Mekonnen  2012 ), the sector receives 
</p>
<p>disproportionate attention in public debates about water use and scarcity, diverting 
</p>
<p>the necessary attention on water use in agriculture and industry. 
</p>
<p> For companies, much confusion exists as to what needs to be measured and 
</p>
<p>reported. Traditionally, companies have focused on monitoring gross water abstrac-
</p>
<p>tions and compliance with legal standards. However, net water abstractions are 
</p>
<p>more relevant than gross abstractions, and meeting wastewater quality standards is 
</p>
<p>not enough to discard the contribution to water pollution made by a company. 
</p>
<p>Regarding terminology and calculation standards, the Water Footprint Network&mdash;a 
</p>
<p>global network of universities, nongovernmental organisations, companies, inves-
</p>
<p>tors and international organisations&mdash;developed the global water footprint standard 
</p>
<p>(Hoekstra et al.  2011 ). The International Organization for Standardization devel-
</p>
<p>oped a reporting standard based on LCA (ISO  2014 ). Both standards emphasise the 
</p>
<p>need to incorporate the temporal and spatial variability in WFs and the need to 
</p>
<p>consider the WF in the context of local water scarcity and water productivity. 
</p>
<p>In practice, companies face a huge challenge in tracing their supply chain. Apparel 
</p>
<p>companies, for example, have generally little idea about where their cotton is grown 
</p>
<p>or processed, yet  both   cotton growing and processing are notorious water consum-
</p>
<p>ers and polluters. It is diffi cult to see quick progress in the fi eld of supply-chain 
</p>
<p>reporting if governments don&rsquo;t force companies to do it.  
</p>
<p>4.4.4     Water Stewardship and Transparency 
</p>
<p> There is an  increasing   call for good  water stewardship and transparency   in the 
</p>
<p>private sector, driven by increased public awareness, demands from investors and 
</p>
<p>perceived water risks by the sector itself. Water stewardship is a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>concept that includes the evaluation of the sustainability of water use across the 
</p>
<p>A.Y. Hoekstra</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>81
</p>
<p>entire value chain, the formulation of water consumption and pollution reduction 
</p>
<p>targets for both the company&rsquo;s operations and supply chain, the implementation of 
</p>
<p>a plan to achieve these targets and proper reporting on all of this (Hoekstra  2014a ). 
</p>
<p>In priority catchments, it requires the pursuit of collective action and community 
</p>
<p>engagement (Sarni  2011 ). Large priority river basins are, for example, the Colorado 
</p>
<p>and San Antonio basins in North America; the Lake Chad, Limpopo and Orange 
</p>
<p>basins in Africa; the basins of the Jordan, Tigris, Euphrates, Indus, Ganges, Krishna, 
</p>
<p>Cauvery, Tarim and Yellow rivers; the Yongding River basins in Asia; and the 
</p>
<p>Murray&ndash;Darling basin in Australia (Hoekstra et al.  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> The increasing interest in how companies relate to unsustainable water use calls 
</p>
<p>for greater transparency on water consumption and pollution. Openness is required 
</p>
<p>at different levels: the company, product and facility level. Driven by environmental 
</p>
<p>organisations and the investment community, businesses are increasingly urged to 
</p>
<p>disclose relevant data at company level on how they relate to water risks (Deloitte 
</p>
<p> 2013 ). Simultaneously, there is an increasing demand for product transparency 
</p>
<p>through labelling or certifi cation. Despite the plethora of existing product labels 
</p>
<p>related to environmental sustainability, none of these includes criteria on sustain-
</p>
<p>able water use. Finally, there is a movement to develop principles and certifi cation 
</p>
<p>schemes for sustainable site or facility management, such as the initiatives of the 
</p>
<p>European Water Partnership and the Alliance for Water Stewardship. But despite 
</p>
<p>progress in awareness, still hardly any companies in the world report on water con-
</p>
<p>sumption and pollution in their supply chain or reveal information about the sustain-
</p>
<p>ability of the WF of their products. 
</p>
<p> Another concern regarding good water stewardship is the extent to which a 
</p>
<p>company pays for the full cost of its water use. Water use is subsidised in many 
</p>
<p>countries, either through direct governmental investments in water supply  infra-
</p>
<p>structure   or indirectly by agricultural subsidies, promotion of crops for bioenergy or 
</p>
<p>fossil- energy subsidies to pump water. Besides, water scarcity and pollution remain 
</p>
<p>unpriced (Hoekstra  2013 ). In order  to   give the right price signal, users should pay 
</p>
<p>for their pollution and consumptive water use, with a differentiated price in time and 
</p>
<p>space based on water vulnerability and scarcity.  
</p>
<p>4.4.5     The Need to Establish WF Benchmarks 
</p>
<p> WFs per unit of product  strongly   vary across different production locations and 
</p>
<p>production systems. Therefore we need to establish WF benchmarks for water- 
</p>
<p>intensive products such as food and beverages, cotton, fl owers and biofuels. The 
</p>
<p>benchmark for a product will depend on the maximum reasonable water consump-
</p>
<p>tion in each step of the product&rsquo;s supply chain, based on best available technology 
</p>
<p>and practice. Benchmarks for the various water-using processes along the supply 
</p>
<p>chain of a product, can be taken together to formulate a WF benchmark for the fi nal 
</p>
<p>product. An end-product point of view is particularly relevant for the companies, 
</p>
<p>retailers and consumers who are not directly involved in the water-using processes 
</p>
<p>4 Water Footprint Assessment in Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82
</p>
<p>in the early steps of the supply chains of the products they are manufacturing, 
</p>
<p>selling or consuming, but still interested in the water performance of the product 
</p>
<p>over the chain as a whole. WF benchmarks will offer a reference for companies to 
</p>
<p>work towards and a reference for governments in allocating WF permits to users. 
</p>
<p>Besides, manufacturers, retailers and fi nal consumers in the lower end of the supply 
</p>
<p>chain get an instrument to compare the actual WF of a product to a certain reference 
</p>
<p>level. Business associations within the different sectors of economy can develop 
</p>
<p>their own regional or global WF benchmarks, though governments can take initia-
</p>
<p>tives in this area as well, including the development of regulations or legislation. 
</p>
<p>The latter  will   be most relevant to completely ban worst practices.  
</p>
<p>4.4.6     Water Footprint Reduction Goals and Possible 
</p>
<p>Trade-Offs 
</p>
<p> Companies  should   strive towards zero WF in industrial operations, which can be 
</p>
<p>achieved through nullifying evaporation losses, full water recycling and recapturing 
</p>
<p>chemicals and heat from used water fl ows. The problem is not the fact that water is 
</p>
<p>being used, but that it is not fully returned to the environment or not returned clean. 
</p>
<p>The WF measures exactly that: the consumptive water use and the volume of water 
</p>
<p>polluted. As the last steps towards zero WF may require more energy, the challenge 
</p>
<p>will be to fi nd a balance between reducing the water and the carbon footprint. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, companies should set reduction targets regarding the WF of their 
</p>
<p>supply chain, particularly in areas of great water scarcity and in cases of low water 
</p>
<p>productivity. In agriculture and mining, achieving a zero WF will generally be impos-
</p>
<p>sible, but in many cases the water consumption and pollution per unit of production 
</p>
<p>can be  reduced   easily and substantially (Brauman et al.  2013 ).   
</p>
<p>4.5     Conclusion 
</p>
<p> Spatial patterns of water depletion and contamination are closely tied to the structure 
</p>
<p>of the global economy. As currently organised, the economic system lacks incentives 
</p>
<p>that promote producers and consumers to move towards wise use of our limited 
</p>
<p>freshwater resources. In order to achieve sustainable, effi cient and equitable water 
</p>
<p>use worldwide, we need greater product transparency, international cooperation, 
</p>
<p>water footprint ceilings per river basin, water footprint benchmarks for water- 
</p>
<p>intensive commodities, water pricing schemes that refl ect local water scarcity and 
</p>
<p>some agreement about equitable sharing of the limited available global water 
</p>
<p>resources among different communities and nations.

<p>5.1          Introduction 
</p>
<p>    Natural resources are the basis for many economic activities that support human 
</p>
<p>wellbeing. Over the last 30 years, global material consumption has increased by 
</p>
<p>80 % in absolute terms, and forecasts suggest that by 2050, human beings will 
</p>
<p> consume about 180 billion tons of different materials. This represents growth by a 
</p>
<p>factor of 2.7 compared to today&rsquo;s levels, leading to increased competition for 
</p>
<p>resource extraction (Dittrich et al.  2012 ). Therefore, policy makers and fi rms, espe-
</p>
<p>cially manufacturers that are highly dependent on natural resources, are increas-
</p>
<p>ingly interested in sustainable raw materials management. 
</p>
<p>  Natural resources   refer to a large set of resources such as water, land, and materi-
</p>
<p>als. In general, while the non-metallic resources (e.g., sand and gravel, aggregates, 
</p>
<p>and energy resources), which are mainly required to satisfy the basic needs for 
</p>
<p>housing, heating, and transportation are more widely available, the metallic 
</p>
<p>resources are becoming more problematic. Although there are many sustainability 
</p>
<p>issues related to renewable resources, in this chapter is focus on management 
</p>
<p>aspects related to non-renewable materials such as metal ores and construction 
</p>
<p>materials (see Fig.  5.1 , shaded boxes).
</p>
<p>   The ability of fi rms to deliver value depends on a consistent supply of material 
</p>
<p>inputs. A particular industry could be more or less resource-intensive, requiring a 
</p>
<p>certain material more than others. Sustainable raw materials management refers to the

</p>
<p>way nations and fi rms manage the natural resources they own and use in production 
</p>
<p>and consumption systems from economic, social, and environmental perspectives. 
</p>
<p> From the fi rm perspective, the stability of raw material availability and supply is 
</p>
<p>a key element for supply chain management and forecasting (Xiao and Yu  2006 ). 
</p>
<p>However,  several   global trends raise concerns including: (a) rapid depletion of the 
</p>
<p>stocks of certain raw materials which results in higher effort during extraction and 
</p>
<p>possibly also higher environmental impacts during extraction and more expansive 
</p>
<p>operations; (b) increasing prices of certain global commodities and resources; and 
</p>
<p>(c) a geographic distribution of materials that may signify concentrated control by 
</p>
<p>some countries (such as China) over certain materials, turning them into what is 
</p>
<p>often described as critical materials, vital for various industries such as the  clean- tech 
</p>
<p>industry in different countries, yet originating from only a few source countries 
</p>
<p>(McKinsey,  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> These global trends have the potential to affect the very core of a fi rm&rsquo;s produc-
</p>
<p>tion activity with the implication that fi rms can benefi t from raw materials 
</p>
<p> management and from active engagement in more sustainable practices and resource 
</p>
<p>management. This approach goes beyond the traditional concept of material costs or 
</p>
<p>inventory management. 
</p>
<p> The production and operations  management   literature has touched on the 
</p>
<p> implications of sustainable management of raw materials from several perspectives: 
</p>
<p>Galbreth et al. ( 2013 ) modelled the optimal material strategy for fi rms, based on 
</p>
<p>potential benefi t, required rate of innovation, and actual environmental impact of 
</p>
<p>more sustainable material use strategies, such as integration of product reuse. Pil 
</p>
<p>and Rothenberg ( 2003 ) demonstrated that environmental improvements have 
</p>
<p> reciprocal effects on manufacturing quality. Others looked at the role of sustain-
</p>
<p>ability in supply chain management and at inspiring new tools and strategies fi rms 
</p>
<p>can use to improve their decision making (Kleindorfer et al.  2005 ). For example, 
</p>
<p>Jacobs and Subramanian ( 2012 ) show how sharing responsibility for sustainable 
</p>
<p>materials management along the supply chain can affect environmental perfor-
</p>
<p>mance and social welfare in product recovery schemes.

</p>
<p> Finally,  policy makers   have demonstrated the central role of policy in materials 
</p>
<p>management and its implications at all levels, from national to fi rm level. National 
</p>
<p>policies directly affect the availability and secured supply of natural resources for 
</p>
<p>industry. The uneven geographical distribution of resources between countries 
</p>
<p>around the world and the decisions by policy makers within countries on  exploration 
</p>
<p>and production may render a resource scarce for a particular country while at a 
</p>
<p>lesser supply risk for another. In addition, some resources may be scarce and their 
</p>
<p>global allocation may be affected by geopolitical challenges, protectionism, and 
</p>
<p>other aspects controlled at the policy level. For example, the ability of fi rms to 
</p>
<p>secure access to resources may affect their choice of manufacturing location, and 
</p>
<p>the national risk of scarcity of certain resources may potentially affect the design of 
</p>
<p>a product and the preference of a substitute material. 
</p>
<p> In this chapter we fi rst discuss key aspects that are important for understanding 
</p>
<p>raw materials management issues related to sustainability at the fi rm and supply 
</p>
<p>chain levels. We then elaborate on the management of material fl ows using tools 
</p>
<p>such as Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA) 
</p>
<p>methods, describing them and providing examples of their use. We continue with a 
</p>
<p>summary of other practical tools and approaches that can be used to enhance sustain-
</p>
<p>able materials management and we conclude with future questions and discussion.  
</p>
<p>5.2     How Changes in Global Production and Consumption 
</p>
<p>Affect Supply Chain Material Management? 
</p>
<p> Raw materials management requires both macro- and microscale understanding. In 
</p>
<p>this section we describe the main aspects that are relevant to the bigger picture in 
</p>
<p>the context of raw materials management in order to provide the reader with the 
</p>
<p>relevant background on this topic. 
</p>
<p>5.2.1     What Is the Trend in Price, Availability, and Recycling 
</p>
<p>Rates of Metallic Resources? 
</p>
<p> Demand for raw materials has soared since the beginning of the twenty-fi rst  century. 
</p>
<p>Growing quality of life in  emerging   economies and industrial expansion there have 
</p>
<p>maintained high levels of pressure on the resource base. At the same time, many 
</p>
<p>emerging economies have deployed strategies to maintain raw materials, especially 
</p>
<p>metallic resources, within the country in order to ensure their continued ability to 
</p>
<p>expand production and meet local demand. For example, China has introduced 
</p>
<p>export restrictions on yellow phosphorous, bauxite, coke, fl uorspar, magnesium, 
</p>
<p>manganese, silicon metal, silicon carbide, and zinc. (EU Commission  2010 ). 
</p>
<p>Furthermore,  the   prices of metals and other commodities have increased since the 
</p>
<p>1970s. Raw materials are reported to be between 5 and 55 % of the product&rsquo;s total 
</p>

<p>90
</p>
<p>cost, depending on the industry, region, and product category (PBL  2014 ; Vogel  2009 ). 
</p>
<p>Therefore, their prices are critical for product planning and development. Prices are 
</p>
<p>usually affected by demand (which increases every year) as well as by the avail-
</p>
<p>ability and effort required to produce these metals. 
</p>
<p>  The   concentration of the metals in the ore decreases over time (International 
</p>
<p>Resource Panel  2011 ) so that mining companies are required to expend more effort in 
</p>
<p>achieving the same yield per every square meter of excavation. As a result, the 
</p>
<p> environmental impacts of mining actions also increase over time (International 
</p>
<p>Resource Panel  2014 ). Technically, some of the metals exist together in ores and 
</p>
<p> therefore not extracted separately. If the demand or supply for a certain metal changes 
</p>
<p>sharply, the entire value-added and  price   structure of the different main and co- 
</p>
<p>materials might change. For example,    copper ores commonly include six  different 
</p>
<p>elements including copper, silver, gold, arsenic, selenium, and tellurium (Graedel 
</p>
<p>et al.  2015 ). A review of recent trends of metal mining sites suggests a shift in the 
</p>
<p>areas where mining companies choose to operate. For example, while in the 1990s 
</p>
<p>South Africa, the USA and Australia produced together more than 50 % of the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>gold, in 2012, this accounted for less than 25 % of the production. Other countries that 
</p>
<p>now produce gold include Mexico, Russia, Peru, Ghana, and China (Scott Wright 
</p>
<p> 2013 , based on USGS production data, Zeal website). The reasons for such a shift 
</p>
<p>include lower concentration in existing mining sites, increasing environmental regula-
</p>
<p>tion of the mining sector in some countries, and overall cost of labor and operation in 
</p>
<p>the more developed countries. The emergence of concepts such as urban mining, 
</p>
<p>referring to mining elements in old landfi lls and in discarded products also suggest 
</p>
<p>that with the reduction in concentration of the metals in the ore overtime, alternatives 
</p>
<p>are needed. 
</p>
<p> On the other side of the equation, it is important to look at trends in  the   recycling 
</p>
<p>rates of different materials. Graedel et al. ( 2011 ) reported recycling rates for about 
</p>
<p>60 metals worldwide and suggested that for many elements, less than 1 % is cur-
</p>
<p>rently recycled. While 18 elements had recycling rates higher than 50 %, most were 
</p>
<p>under 25 %. It was also evident that for many of the elements there is insuffi cient 
</p>
<p>data for reporting and, therefore, a great deal of important information about end- 
</p>
<p>of- life  recycling and  technologies for many materials is missing. Furthermore, Reck 
</p>
<p>and Graedel ( 2012 ) make the distinction between end-of-life recycling rates for 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;base metals&rdquo;, reaching 50 % and or more, and &ldquo;specialty elements&rdquo; which are 
</p>
<p>hardly ever recycled. 
</p>
<p>    Base metals are elements that are commonly used in large quantities and 
</p>
<p> relatively pure forms, making them easier to re-smelt, and in products with longer 
</p>
<p>life spans for which suitable recycling infrastructure is already in place. On the 
</p>
<p>other hand, specialty metals are used in small quantities, mixed with other  elements 
</p>
<p>which are hard to separate, and in products with much shorter life spans (such as 
</p>
<p>electronic devices) which require extensive collection and recycling  operations   to 
</p>
<p>economically justify their extraction at the product&rsquo;s end of life. They suggest that 
</p>
<p>three main improvements have to occur in order for society to reap the environ-
</p>
<p>mental benefi ts embodied in metals recycling: (1) extended collection efforts, 
</p>
<p>(2) better design of products for recycling, and (3) new and better recycling 
</p>
<p>technologies.

</p>
<p> Based on all of the above parameters, one can start asking questions about the 
</p>
<p>criticality of some materials for everyday economic activities or for specifi c applica-
</p>
<p>tions and industries. Graedel et al. ( 2015 ) suggested a methodology to assess the 
</p>
<p>criticality of materials at the national level.    Figure  5.2  explains their framework for 
</p>
<p>looking at criticality in three dimensions: supply risk, environmental implications, 
</p>
<p>and vulnerability to supply restriction. Several indicators on each axis are  aggregated 
</p>
<p>to arrive at a criticality assessment, as indicated on the diagram. Data sources for 
</p>
<p>such criticality assessment could be the following: (a) metal in-use stock determina-
</p>
<p>tions, (b) material fl ow analysis, (c) metal substitution potential, (d) country- level 
</p>
<p>information, and (e) environmental lifecycle assessment results. Firms can use this 
</p>
<p>framework in order to assess criticality of specifi c elements they use in their 
</p>
<p>products.
</p>
<p>5.2.2        What Are the  Environmental Impacts of   Raw Materials 
</p>
<p>Extraction? 
</p>
<p> Raw materials extraction results in different environmental impacts created by the 
</p>
<p>mining equipment, the digging, the chemicals used for extraction, and the transpor-
</p>
<p>tation activities in and out of the mine area. In the extraction phase, the &ldquo;Ecological 
</p>
<p>Rucksack&rdquo; or Material Intensity (in kilograms) has become a common unit of 
</p>
<p> measure. This unit of measure (factor), developed by the Wuppertal Institute in 
</p>
<p>Germany, refers to the amount of materials moved to obtain 1 kg of the resource, 
</p>
<p>also known as Material Input per Service Unit (MIPS) (Wuppertal Institute  2015 ).

</p>
<p>The MIPS index is published for a variety of materials and provides a quick and 
</p>
<p>good reference to demonstrate the effort and impacts associated with the extraction 
</p>
<p>of different materials. 
</p>
<p> Raw materials extraction also creates a set of impacts that includes air pollution, 
</p>
<p>soil contamination, water pollution due to energy and water use, as well as waste and 
</p>
<p>emissions emitted in the different processes. The mining industry is considered a 
</p>
<p>very energy-intensive sector (Lusty and Gunn  2014 ) and is therefore associated with 
</p>
<p>a variety of environmental impacts. Table  5.1  provides examples of the MIPS factors 
</p>
<p>and a range of primary energy consumption numbers based on a full Lifecycle 
</p>
<p>Assessment (LCA) approach, from extraction of raw materials to the end of the use-
</p>
<p>ful life of a product. This LCA approach is used to demonstrate the differences 
</p>
<p>among several materials and takes into account the full impacts. (See Chap.   2     by 
</p>
<p>Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 ) for more on LCA.) Several databases and software 
</p>
<p>tools allow companies and researchers to conduct LCA (for example,  Ecoinvnet LCI 
</p>
<p>database ;  GaBi 6. LCA software ). Energy and MIPS factors are available for a variety 
</p>
<p>of mineral fertilizers, resins, construction materials, plastics, chemicals, metals, etc. 
</p>
<p>In order to illustrate this factor, several commonly used materials as well as more 
</p>
<p>rare materials with very high energy and waste intensity are listed in Table  5.1 .
</p>
<p>   The table  suggests   that some rare materials such as precious metals (i.e., gold 
</p>
<p>and platinum) and diamonds are very resource- and energy-intensive at the extrac-
</p>
<p>tion and production stages, thousands or even hundreds of thousands times more 
</p>
<p>than more common and abundant materials such as aluminum, lead, etc. 
</p>
<p> Different LCA studies which take into account the environmental impacts of 
</p>
<p>products across their different lifecycle stages reveal that a signifi cant share of the 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts of production actually originate in the raw materials 
</p>
<p> extraction and production phases. Therefore, these stages show great potential for 
</p>
<p>increased eco-effi ciency. Due to the high environmental and social impacts of raw 
</p>
<p>materials extraction, more and more countries tighten their environmental  regulations 
</p>
<p>in the extraction sector.

<p>5.2.3     How Does Raw Material Extraction Affect Different 
</p>
<p>Sectors of the Economy? 
</p>
<p> Despite the evident role of materials management and the potential for resource 
</p>
<p>effi ciency, scarcity of resources and susceptibility to supply risk are perceived dif-
</p>
<p>ferently in different sectors. In this section we introduce the different approaches 
</p>
<p>and point to the sectors most susceptible. 
</p>
<p>5.2.3.1     Sector-Level Impact 
</p>
<p> Materials  scarcity   is presumed to affect different sectors in different ways. A  survey 
</p>
<p>of senior executives of leading global companies on the impact of minerals and 
</p>
<p> metals scarcity on business, conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC  2011 ), 
</p>
<p>illustrates how some sectors may be perceived to be more susceptible to scarcity. 
</p>
<p>In the survey, 69 senior executives from leading companies were interviewed on 
</p>
<p>different aspects related to scarcity, including awareness, preparedness, impact, 
</p>
<p>causes, risks, and opportunities, and responses to mineral and metal scarcity. The 
</p>
<p>executives interviewed were from seven different sectors including aviation, auto-
</p>
<p>motive, chemicals, energy and utilities, high-tech, infrastructure and renewable 
</p>
<p>energy. Key actors in these sectors were surveyed, with revenues of 84 % of the 
</p>
<p>companies exceeding $10 billion and revenues of the remaining 16 % ranging from 
</p>
<p>$2&ndash;10 billion. The respondents included directors, vice-presidents, and other senior 
</p>
<p>executives. According to the PwC survey, certain sectors perceived the scarcity of 
</p>
<p>minerals and metals to be a more pressing issue than others. For example, 82 % of 
</p>
<p>respondents in the infrastructure sector considered the issue to be pressing and 
</p>
<p>78 % considered it to be so in the high- tech sector. In the aviation and energy and 
</p>
<p>utilities sectors, only about 50 % considered the issue to be pressing. Key insights 
</p>
<p>that emerged from the report included lack of awareness of the issue of scarcity 
</p>
<p>amongst stakeholders. The scarcity risk was perceived to be rising in a 5-year pro-
</p>
<p>jection, with the expectation that the impact will be felt throughout the entire sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain. Moreover, it was found that the leading driver of scarcity apart from 
</p>
<p>demand (65 %) was geopolitics (54 %) while the exhaustion of reserves rated less 
</p>
<p>highly (30 %). In addition, low substitution was also perceived as a major driver of 
</p>
<p>scarcity, particularly for renewable energy (89 %), energy and utilities (79 %) and 
</p>
<p>chemical (78 %) industries. Companies singled out resource effi ciency as the key 
</p>
<p>response to the rising scarcity challenge (75 %) and also highlighted the impor-
</p>
<p>tance of collaboration, such as strategic alliances along the supply chain to tackle 
</p>
<p>the challenge. A high level of cooperation with fi rst-tier suppliers was particularly 
</p>
<p>evident in certain sectors. According to the survey, the level of preparedness at the 
</p>
<p>time the survey was conducted varied according to sectors. For example, 67 % of 
</p>
<p>respondents in the renewable energy sector and 64 % of respondents in the 
</p>
<p> automotive sector felt  prepared, while only 33 % in the high-tech and chemical 
</p>
<p>industry felt prepared.

<p>5 Sustainable Non-Renewable Materials Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>94
</p>
<p> Angerer et al. ( 2009 ) emphasizes that from a statistical standpoint&mdash;it is not 
</p>
<p>depletion of natural resources that is affecting the supply of raw materials, but rather 
</p>
<p>the imbalance between supply and demand. This imbalance was caused by an 
</p>
<p>inability to predict two major variables&mdash;the fi rst is  technological developments 
</p>
<p>  that exert unexpected pressures on specifi c materials. For example the report points 
</p>
<p>to gallium, used for production of thin-layer photovoltaics and high-speed, 
</p>
<p> integrated circuits, which is expected to cause a sixfold increase in demand by 2030. 
</p>
<p>The second variable is the challenge posed by China&rsquo;s economic growth and that of 
</p>
<p>the world economy at large. As the gap between rich and poor nations diminishes, 
</p>
<p>consumption increases and with it the world&rsquo;s economic output, which relies on an 
</p>
<p>ever-growing stream of materials for production.  
</p>
<p>5.2.3.2     Who Is More Susceptible? 
</p>
<p>  Clean-tech companies   are particularly susceptible to scarcity and criticality of raw 
</p>
<p>materials. First, many of the technologies are emerging technologies with an ever 
</p>
<p>increasing number of materials in each product. Second, many of the technologies 
</p>
<p>already rely on critical materials. When it comes to the energy clean-tech cases of 
</p>
<p>wind, vehicles, PV cells, lighting and fuel cells, all these technologies rely on  critical 
</p>
<p>minerals for their components. Thin fi lm PV panels require tellurium,  gallium ger-
</p>
<p>manium, indium, selenium, silver, and cadmium. Wind energy generators require 
</p>
<p>neodymium, and dysprosium, and lithium&ndash;ion batteries in electric  vehicles require 
</p>
<p>lithium and cobalt. 1  Platinum and palladium are used for technologies related to 
</p>
<p>emissions prevention. Silver and REEs are used for emissions purifi cation (European 
</p>
<p>Commission  2008 ). Surveys and interviews conducted with industry illustrate the 
</p>
<p>importance given to scarcity. Table  5.2  summarizes the main materials used for 
</p>
<p>emerging  technologi  es and the forecasted shortage in supply for 2030.
</p>
<p>   Note: the indicators calculate the share of demand for those materials from 
</p>
<p>emerging technologies, out of the total world production in 2006. If the ratio is 
</p>
<p>higher than one, it means there is not enough supply. 
</p>
<p> The table suggests that for many materials, if world production will not increase 
</p>
<p>substantially, the demands will be a few times higher than the available supply.   
</p>
<p>5.2.4     What Is the Environmental Impact Versus Economic 
</p>
<p>Added Value along the Value Chain? 
</p>
<p> The link between economic and environmental parameters on the value chain can 
</p>
<p>be constructed using measures that take into account the eco-effi ciency of 
</p>
<p>the  lifecycle stages of the different products as presented  in   Fig.  5.3  for mobile 
</p>

</p>
<p>the scale of the environmental impact on the Y axis and the economic added value 
</p>
<p>on the X axis, and numbers the different stages of the lifecycle of phone production 
</p>
<p>beginning with the extraction of raw materials. As the fi gure illustrates, in the fi rst 
</p>
<p>stages the environmental impact is highest while the contribution to the economic 
</p>
<p>added value is lowest; therefore, the slope of the chart at that stage is very steep. 
</p>
<p>This observation is relevant to different industries. In addition, various end-of-life 
</p>
<p>scenarios can be integrated into the analysis, especially important in products with 
</p>
<p>high refurbishing and recycling rates of products, parts, and materials. In the case of 
</p>
<p>mobile phones, as presented in the fi gure for stage 5 and onwards, remanufacturing 
</p>
<p>captures added value, with much lower environmental impact because the raw 
</p>
<p>materials extraction and phone manufacturing stages are avoided.
</p>
<p>   It is also important to note that in many cases, the product&rsquo;s lifecycle spans 
</p>
<p>across different countries. For example, a country where the environmental impact 
</p>
<p>is potentially the highest may see little added value in contributing to the environ-
</p>
<p>mental degradation caused by the extraction of raw materials. Moreover, materials 
</p>
<p>may not necessarily be available in the country in which the stage in the supply 
</p>
<p>chain occurs, thus further contributing to environmental impact as is the case, for 
</p>
<p>example, in transportation. 
</p>
<p> Added value analysis using combined economic and environmental parameters 
</p>
<p>is becoming a more common tool in different sectors.  The   automobile and textiles 
</p>
<p>industries are good examples of industries where added value is not well distrib-
</p>
<p>uted. Most of the environmental impacts are attributed to the early stages of raw 
</p>
<p>materials extraction and production, while most of the economic added values occur 
</p>
<p>at the later stages of sales in the case of textiles and sales and service in the case of 
</p>
<p>cars. Furthermore, there is also an end-of-life dismantling value for cars as  recycling 
</p>
<p>becomes mandatory in many countries. 
</p>
<p>5.2.4.1     Production Side: Mining Companies 
</p>
<p>    The market structure of the mining industry is highly concentrated. According to the 
</p>
<p>Raw Material Group quoted in an EU report, less than 4 % of mining companies (149 
</p>
<p>out of 4173 companies) controlled 83 % of the metal mining market (European 
</p>
<p>Commission  2008 ). Such a centralized market structure is prone to risks emanating 
</p>
<p>from unexpected problems to the stability of these companies and from possible 
</p>
<p>illegal coordination between them to infl uence market prices. Tackling price volatil-
</p>
<p>ity, fraud, regulatory uncertainty, mounting government hostility to the mining sec-
</p>
<p>tor, water/energy availability, worker safety and a talent gap are all key priority areas 
</p>
<p>presenting major challenges to the mining industry. According to a recent report, in 
</p>
<p>order to address these challenges and manage global trends, the mining industry&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>previous focus on volume has to be replaced with more strategic scenario planning 
</p>
<p>as well as innovative new approaches for dealing with supply chain stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>Media and civil society scrutiny of the local environmental impacts of mining com-
</p>
<p>panies has expanded in scale and scope and includes monitoring and standard setting 
</p>
<p>bodies. Mounting hostility to the mining industry has also proliferated, highlighting 
</p>
<p>the unsustainability of current management of stakeholders in the  supply chain.

</p>
<p>Some countries have reconsidered their resource management resulting in demand 
</p>
<p>for new royalty regimes, concessions and even expropriation. Examples mainly 
</p>
<p>relate to developing countries, but also to some developed countries, such as the new 
</p>
<p>mining royalty regime introduced in Qu&eacute;bec in 2013 (Deloitte  2013 ).  
</p>
<p>5.2.4.2     Downstream Firm Level Perspective 
</p>
<p> There are several reasons and motivations for fi rms to be aware and better informed 
</p>
<p>about their raw materials management, especially critical materials. These include:
</p>
<p>&bull;       Supply chain disruption&mdash;Rare earth minerals and critical materials are unevenly 
</p>
<p>distributed throughout the world. Companies reliant on them could suffer opera-
</p>
<p>tionally and fi nancially if a certain government decides to stop export in order to 
</p>
<p>increase the resource price, or if a natural phenomenon hinders material extrac-
</p>
<p>tion and logistics.  
</p>
<p>&bull;      Resource risk&mdash;As extraction companies exhaust their efforts to reach readily 
</p>
<p>available materials, they will have to extend their operations into more expansive 
</p>
<p>and environmentally impactful territory. This could affect manufacturers&rsquo; cost 
</p>
<p>analysis and their accountability to local communities as well as their clients in 
</p>
<p>ensuring supplier sustainability.  
</p>
<p>&bull;      Reliance on China as supplier and market&mdash;China produces 90 % of the global 
</p>
<p>supply of rare earth minerals. Its monopoly on these essential resources allows it 
</p>
<p>to control prices and fl ows by restricting export. In 2014, the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization upheld a ruling that China had violated international trade rules in 
</p>
<p>these restrictions, specifi cally through tariffs and export quotas. While the WTO 
</p>
<p>decision could facilitate export, illegal mining is still a matter of confl ict between 
</p>
<p>local and national government (Shen  2014 ). Furthermore, within a growing 
</p>
<p>global demand for rare earth, China&rsquo;s own demand exceeds the rest of the world&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>(de Boer and Lammertsma  2012 ).  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Regulation in different countries&mdash;While some countries have set concrete poli-
</p>
<p>cies to identify critical materials, assess their risk of depletion, and put in place 
</p>
<p>measures to reduce it, they vary in scope of materials and extent of solutions. For 
</p>
<p>example, while the USA has a holistic approach to determine material criticality, 
</p>
<p>its strategy focuses on the energy sector (DEFRA  2012 ).  
</p>
<p>&bull;      Price volatility&mdash;Commodity prices have not remained stable over the past 
</p>
<p>two decades, with growing demand from emerging economic centers such as 
</p>
<p>China and India pushing prices up, followed by falling prices in the wake of 
</p>
<p>the fi nancial crisis of 2008. Changes in oil prices have been particularly vola-
</p>
<p>tile, making it harder for companies to predict their long-term costs and rev-
</p>
<p>enues (Lin  2009 ).  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Availability of alternative materials&mdash;Some of the world&rsquo;s most widely used 
</p>
<p>metals have no easily available substitutes for their current major uses, includ-
</p>
<p>ing, for example,    copper, chromium, manganese and lead (Graedel et al.  2015 ). 
</p>
<p>Thus, fi nding design solutions ahead of diminishing supply, or alternatively fi nd-
</p>
<p>ing new sources of supply from existing stocks becomes a critical task for com-
</p>
<p>panies&rsquo; long-term planning efforts.  
</p>
<p>5 Sustainable Non-Renewable Materials Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>98
</p>
<p>&bull;   Size of business&mdash; Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)   are particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to disruptions in the supply of raw materials, as they are often less 
</p>
<p>aware and less equipped to fi nd alternatives when these problems arise. Higher 
</p>
<p>material costs can also negatively affect their competitive positions, unless the 
</p>
<p>government takes action to ensure their survival by, for example, ensuring 
</p>
<p>national material reserves (de Boer and Lammertsma  2012 ). However, SMEs 
</p>
<p>can also become part of the solution through technological and design innova-
</p>
<p>tion, or taking part in national research programs (DEFRA  2012 ).  
</p>
<p>&bull;      Low stakeholder awareness of scarcity&mdash;Research has found distinct differences 
</p>
<p>between economic sectors in their awareness of natural resources scarcity and its 
</p>
<p>possible effects on their prosperity. For example, the infrastructure, high-tech 
</p>
<p>and automotive industries showed a high level of concern when asked if minerals 
</p>
<p>and metals scarcity is a pressing issue for the fi rm, in contrast to only half of the 
</p>
<p>respondents in the aviation industry (PWC  2011 ).     
</p>
<p>5.2.4.3     Downstream Consumers Level Perspective 
</p>
<p>    One of the inevitable forces driving resource scarcity is the growing demand for 
</p>
<p>new products and technology by a rapidly urbanizing world that is expected to see 
</p>
<p>three billion new consumers entering the middle class by 2050, most of them in 
</p>
<p>emerging markets (World Economic Forum  2013 ). During the twentieth century, 
</p>
<p>resource use per capita globally doubled while income increased by a factor of 
</p>
<p>seven, refl ecting a relative decoupling of economic growth and resource use (UNEP 
</p>
<p> 2012 ). However, the International Resource Panel warns that current consumption 
</p>
<p>rates are unsustainable and will lead to accelerated resource depletion and further 
</p>
<p>shocks to the economic system. The panel urged governments and companies to act 
</p>
<p>rapidly to increase resource productivity, mentioning in its 2014 report that some 
</p>
<p>forecasts caution that certain rare earth metals will run out in two decades unless 
</p>
<p>recycling rates dramatically improve (International Resource Panel  2014 ). That 
</p>
<p>said, cities are already moving toward a zero waste vision, adopting the waste hier-
</p>
<p>archy, trying to eliminate resources from ending up in landfi lls, and engaging in 
</p>
<p>urban mining that captures the full potential of material stocks in the city (UNEP 
</p>
<p> 2012 ). Overall consumption plays an important role in the demand upstream of raw 
</p>
<p>materials, and fi rms may conclude that their strategy must change and they may 
</p>
<p>need to take an active part in decreasing the rate of product replacements and tech-
</p>
<p>nology cycles.    
</p>
<p>5.3     How Can Industry Better Understand Material Flows? 
</p>
<p>    In previous sections we highlighted the risks involved with production of certain 
</p>
<p>materials, especially metals, due to unexpected changes in demand, technology, or 
</p>
<p>even states&rsquo; willingness to allow trade that might undermine their material resource 
</p>
<p>V. Blass et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>99
</p>
<p>base. These risks require fi rms as well as governments to evaluate their current and 
</p>
<p>future needs. It also requires assessing how these materials accumulate and move 
</p>
<p>throughout the economy, supply chains, or within their borders as stocks and fl ows. 
</p>
<p>In this section we review several tools to conduct these assessments, focusing on the 
</p>
<p>MFA methodology. We introduce the concepts and uses of MFA studies as a generic 
</p>
<p>tool that can be used at different levels and continue with the more specifi c fi rm 
</p>
<p>level tool of MFCA while providing some concrete examples. 
</p>
<p>5.3.1     Introduction to Material Flow Analysis 
</p>
<p>  Industrial ecology   is a growing discipline of research that aims to understand the 
</p>
<p>structure and function of industrial or societal metabolism, or how materials move 
</p>
<p>and transform in different systems and processes across space and time (Ayres and 
</p>
<p>Ayres  2002 ). For example, how does a certain country use fossil fuels? What hap-
</p>
<p>pens to paper globally in different phases of its lifecycle? In order to answer such 
</p>
<p>questions industrial ecologists have created different quantitative methodologies. 
</p>
<p>   For example, LCA allows us to measure and compare the different impacts that 
</p>
<p>certain products or services have on the environment in each of the phases of their 
</p>
<p>lifecycle&mdash;from raw materials extraction, to production and use, to end of life, such 
</p>
<p>as landfi lling or recycling&mdash;based on a detailed account of the inputs and outputs 
</p>
<p>invested and created in the system (see also Chap.   2     by Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 ) 
</p>
<p>on LCA and Chap.   4     by Hoekstra on water footprinting). 
</p>
<p> A complementary tool that concentrates on the material fl ow side is MFA, which 
</p>
<p>studies the fl ows and stocks of materials across a defi ned system, with explicit 
</p>
<p>boundaries in a given timeframe. It is the main  quantitative tool   available today to 
</p>
<p>assess and map the use of raw materials by type, quantity and location across supply 
</p>
<p>chains, economic sectors, regions, nations, or the economy at large. It can point to 
</p>
<p>potential depletion in specifi c raw materials and gaps in recycling rates, and can 
</p>
<p>provide useful predictions that may affect decisions regarding future developments 
</p>
<p>and operations. Most MFA studies in recent years were done at the region and coun-
</p>
<p>try level, although some aimed at worldwide  assessment   (see Box  5.1  and Behrens 
</p>
<p>et al.,  2007 ). 
</p>
<p> The immediate geographical location of companies also affects their perfor-
</p>
<p>mance and decisions in multiple fi elds&mdash;city zoning codes, available resources for 
</p>
<p>production, regulation on waste and energy management, transportation costs, and 
</p>
<p>so on. Thus, learning about  the   city&rsquo;s and the region&rsquo;s material fl ows can heavily 
</p>
<p>infl uence companies&rsquo; strategies and operational management. Describing the way 
</p>
<p>cities mobilize, use and discard materials has been instrumental in understanding 
</p>
<p>cities as systems since the 1960s. Researchers conducting MFAs believe they can 
</p>
<p>improve both regional and corporate materials management, optimizing resource 
</p>
<p>extraction and use, and ensuring proper environmental protection best fi tted for the 
</p>
<p>region in question. MFAs can also serve as indicators, or as the basis for a monitor-
</p>
<p>ing program to evaluate companies&rsquo; actions and regional or municipal policy mea-

<p>     Box 5.1 The Yale Stocks and Flows (STAF) Project By Thomas Graedel 
</p>
<p>and Barbara Reck, Yale University 
</p>
<p> Modern society is made possible by the use of metals, and metals have 
</p>
<p> historically been supplied from virgin stocks (ore bodies, mineral deposits, 
</p>
<p>and the like). Other reservoirs exist, however, a principal one being materials 
</p>
<p>or products in use, stored, or discarded over the years by corporations and 
</p>
<p>individuals. These reservoirs might become very important in the next few 
</p>
<p>decades of rapid population growth and resource and energy use. There are 
</p>
<p>also concerns about the use of energy in the extraction and processing of met-
</p>
<p>als, and realization that the loss of resources by dissipation or landfi lling can 
</p>
<p>sometimes be problematic from an environmental standpoint, and concerns 
</p>
<p>over the short and long-term &ldquo;criticality&rdquo; of metals. 
</p>
<p> The STAF project evaluates current and historical fl ows of specifi c techno-
</p>
<p>logically signifi cant materials, determining the stocks available in different 
</p>
<p>types of reservoirs and the fl ows among the reservoirs, developing scenarios 
</p>
<p>of possible futures of metal use, and assessing metal supply and demand. 
</p>
<p>Between 2002 and 2010, the group completed the characterization and quan-
</p>
<p>tifi cation of the material fl ow cycles of copper, zinc, chromium, lead, iron, 
</p>
<p>nickel, silver, and stainless steel, comprising complete cycle characterizations 
</p>
<p>for all countries using signifi cant amounts of these materials (more than 50), 
</p>
<p>nine world regions including Europe, North America and Asia, and the planet 
</p>
<p>as a whole. Figure  5.4  is  an   example of this work. Targeted studies of a few 
</p>
<p>states and cities have also been accomplished. Specialized studies on tin, 
</p>
<p>cobalt, tungsten, aluminum, and ten of the rare  earths   have been done as well, 
</p>
<p>and additional studies are under way.

units are Gg (thousand metric tons) of nickel per year (adapted from Reck et al.  2008 ). 
In this example, the charts demonstrate how mining and production happens in CIS but are 
not largely consumed locally and therefore leave the region while the fabrication and con-
sumption quantities in EU are much larger than locally extracted and therefore fl ows enter 
the system

<p>(Binder et al.  2009 ). Examples of regional and urban scale MFAs include, among 
</p>
<p>others, Vienna and its hinterlands, Basque Country, London, Hamburg, Singapore 
</p>
<p>and Lisbon. (See Kennedy et al.,  2007 , providing examples from different metro-
</p>
<p>politan regions around the globe.) 
</p>
<p> Doing an MFA study can be a lengthy process, mainly due to data availability 
</p>
<p>challenges. Although interest in MFA studies is increasing, it is still not a common 
</p>
<p>tool used by nations and fi rms. In the practical implications section, we review 
</p>
<p>MFA studies, how they can be used at fi rm level and for what purposes. 
</p>
<p>5.3.2       How Can MFA be Utilized in Strategic and Operational 
</p>
<p>Planning? 
</p>
<p> Firms have different opportunities to use resources more effi ciently. MFA  provides 
</p>
<p>an excellent tool for companies to track and manage their materials management.

<p>   Tracking the type, quantities, origin and transformation of  materials along the sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain enables companies to identify opportunities for  sustainable materials 
</p>
<p>management and possible hotspots along the fl ow of materials. Depending on the 
</p>
<p>question or challenge at hand, an MFA can be conducted on different levels. The 
</p>
<p>fi rst step in identifying the opportunities of fi rms to become more sustainable in 
</p>
<p>their raw materials management is a review of the actual materials the fi rm uses, 
</p>
<p>where they come from and how they transform along the supply chain. In other 
</p>
<p>words, this means performing an MFA at different levels, depending on the system 
</p>
<p>in which the fi rm operates, or the problem the analyst is trying to solve&mdash;from a 
</p>
<p>single product to whole supply chains, from factory and neighborhood to city, 
</p>
<p>national and even global analyses. Furthermore, MFA is becoming a customary tool 
</p>
<p>in policy analysis and design. Thus, it may help fi rms anticipate and prepare for 
</p>
<p>regulatory changes that would mandate a change in operations and strategy. 
</p>
<p>Following are several examples of MFA studies used at different scales along with 
</p>
<p>the risks and opportunities they expose and their possible uses for companies. 
</p>
<p>5.3.2.1     Using MFA to Optimize Production Processes 
</p>
<p> Industry has successfully used MFA insights to adjust material fl ows  and   waste 
</p>
<p>streams in production processes in order to maximize both economic and  environmental 
</p>
<p>gains (Binder  2007 ). Analyzing the material fl ows in industrial parks offers an 
</p>
<p> especially salient opportunity to identify opportunities for greater effi ciency, as well 
</p>
<p>as possible benefi cial use of by-products created by different entities within the park 
</p>
<p>(Sendra et al.  2007 ). MFA can refl ect potential gains in material effi ciency at a single 
</p>
<p>factory level as well, disaggregating production into different stages and processes. 
</p>
<p> Looking at a particular substance fl ow through the economy can also help iden-
</p>
<p>tify potential improvements for specifi c industries and systems. For example, 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>102
</p>
<p>Kowalski and Mazanek ( 1998 ) analyzed the fl ow of sodium chromate in Poland. 
</p>
<p>Their analysis indicated that by technologically  modernizing   chromium production 
</p>
<p>and using various chromium compounds, industry can improve its chromium waste 
</p>
<p>management solutions so that imported raw materials are reduced, storage fees are 
</p>
<p>reduced and productivity is improved.  
</p>
<p>5.3.2.2     Using MFA to Identify and Weigh Pollution Sources 
</p>
<p>    Finding the causes of pollution and its detrimental effects can often be an intricate 
</p>
<p>endeavor. Regulators, courts and communities, as well as fi rms aiming to diminish 
</p>
<p>their impact on the environment may need to contend with multiple possible sources 
</p>
<p>of pollution in different locations, perhaps even in different times, with multiple 
</p>
<p>materials intertwining downstream. MFA can help identify, classify and weigh the 
</p>
<p>relative contribution each source and each material may have in creating 
</p>
<p> environmental harm, and thus lead the way in its solution. 
</p>
<p> For example, Cadmium (Cd) is a dangerous substance known to cause human 
</p>
<p>kidney disease and other physical illnesses through chronic exposure. It is easily 
</p>
<p>absorbed into the body through food, smoking and contaminated air and water, and 
</p>
<p>has a slow rate of excretion. One of the known sources of Cd is agricultural fertil-
</p>
<p>izers, as Cd is present in relatively high concentrations in the phosphate rocks and 
</p>
<p>acid used in their manufacturing. Kwonpongsagoon et al. ( 2007 ) used MFA to 
</p>
<p>examine how Cd is used in the Australian economy and how it dissipates into the 
</p>
<p>environment. By conducting a thorough substance fl ow analysis, which tracks a 
</p>
<p>single substance, Cd, researchers can fi nd hidden and expected fl ows of Cd. For 
</p>
<p>example, construction materials were found to be an important Cd sink in Australia 
</p>
<p>in addition to non-ferrous metal production and electricity generation, which are the 
</p>
<p>main sources of Cd emissions. These results suggested that the National Cadmium 
</p>
<p>Minimization Strategy, which focused on crops and soils, should pay greater atten-
</p>
<p>tion to intentional use of Cd products and to wastes containing Cd. If a change in 
</p>
<p>regulation occurs, fi rms in these industries would need to take into account the 
</p>
<p> possibility of stricter substance control, which would require a change in their 
</p>
<p>  production   methods and in their end-of pipe solutions.  
</p>
<p>5.3.2.3     Using MFA to Analyze Products and Identify Hidden Trade-Offs 
</p>
<p>    When a particular product or material is found to have harmful effects on the envi-
</p>
<p>ronment or on public health (or both), one of the solutions may be to substitute this 
</p>
<p>material or product for another, more benign alternative. That is also one of the 
</p>
<p>theoretical solutions for dealing with resource depletion or scarcity. MFA can help 
</p>
<p>identify potential problems associated with substitution. For example, in a study of 
</p>
<p>the shift to a lead-free economy, an MFA conduced on the Japanese market, and on 
</p>
<p>solders in particular, found that while the shift to lead-free solders has progressed 
</p>
<p>rapidly with the substitution of silver and copper for lead, it slows down in the 
</p>
<p>V. Blass et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>103
</p>
<p>products&rsquo; late lifecycle stages, due to the long life spans of electronic products. 
</p>
<p>Thus, not only do emissions still contain lead, but they now also contain silver 
</p>
<p>with its possible impacts on air and water quality. One of the benefi cial ways to 
</p>
<p>decrease these emissions could be higher circuit board recycling rates (Fuse and 
</p>
<p>Tsunemi  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> Lam et al. ( 2013 ) combined environmental impact assessment with dynamic 
</p>
<p>MFA in order to predict the timing of product substitution, the changing quantities 
</p>
<p>of e-waste generation, and the environmental burden the electronic products market 
</p>
<p>may create in coming years. Based on their analysis they proposed a consideration 
</p>
<p>of e-waste pollution prevention measures, targeting specifi c materials with high 
</p>
<p>toxicity rates taking in mind their model&rsquo;s estimated timing of disposal. 
</p>
<p> Looking at a specifi c market, MFA is particularly useful in calculating available 
</p>
<p>stocks and forecasting needs for a specifi c material in different timeframes. Bergsdal 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2007 ) integrated scenarios about population, persons per dwelling, and fl oor 
</p>
<p>area per dwelling, with data regarding the Norwegian housing stock to infer wood 
</p>
<p>and concrete demand over the coming century. They found that despite decreasing 
</p>
<p>growth in concrete density, its total use is expected to increase due to continued 
</p>
<p>increase in housing stock. The outgoing fl ow of concrete is delayed, due to its late 
</p>
<p>introduction as a building material and low renovation rate. Wood, on the other hand, 
</p>
<p>has always been a prominent building material in Norway and undergoes renovation 
</p>
<p>much more frequently, thus creating more output from renovation and demolition.  
</p>
<p>5.3.2.4     Using MFA to Design a More Effi cient and Effective Recycling 
</p>
<p>Scheme 
</p>
<p>    MFA is also useful in looking at waste patterns and designing effective recycling 
</p>
<p>schemes. In Beijing, for example, MFA was used to prepare for upcoming recycling 
</p>
<p>schemes in the electronic appliances sector. Researchers used surveys and existing 
</p>
<p>data to project the amount of electronic units to be discarded in recycling centers 
</p>
<p>versus other end-of-life options. Thus, it allowed a more informed planning process, 
</p>
<p>both by companies expected to take part in the recycling scheme, by recyclers that 
</p>
<p>are dependent on the infl ow of end-of-life electronic appliances and by local gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, which needs to build proper recycling infrastructure and reshape its waste 
</p>
<p>policies accordingly (Liu et al.  2006 ). 
</p>
<p> In Denmark, MFA of NdFeB permanent magnets, which are used in 
</p>
<p> telecommunication products, electronic appliances and energy technology, 
</p>
<p>revealed that focusing recycling efforts on household consumers could yield 
</p>
<p> minimal results in terms of actual supply of rare earth minerals such as neodym-
</p>
<p>ium, a key element in the magnets. The study showed that despite the fact that IT 
</p>
<p>applications comprise 60 % of the maximum theoretical recovery potential, overall 
</p>
<p>potential recovery rates of neodymium and dysprosium from NdFeB in Denmark 
</p>
<p>were equivalent to the amount found in fi ve 3 MW direct-drive wind turbines. 
</p>
<p>Thus, it is much more economically sensible and practical to focus efforts on 
</p>
<p>major end users such as wind turbines, rather than hundreds of thousands of decen-
</p>
<p>tralized sources (Habib et al.  2014 ). 
</p>
<p>5 Sustainable Non-Renewable Materials Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>104
</p>
<p> One of the most important utilizations of MFA in improving recycling schemes 
</p>
<p>lies in enabling the process of urban mining&mdash;the systematic reuse of materials 
</p>
<p>originating in human use in urban areas. Tapping existing stocks of resources, 
</p>
<p>whether in infrastructure, houses or landfi lls, requires the preservation of informa-
</p>
<p>tion regarding available materials from production through recovery, and the 
</p>
<p> location of recycling facilities in or close to cities so that they remain both economic 
</p>
<p>and environmentally benefi cial (Brunner  2011 ).   
</p>
<p>5.3.3     How Could Firms Integrate MFA with Cost Analysis? 
</p>
<p> The concept of MFA described in the previous section has been further developed 
</p>
<p>into a practical tool for fi rms, linking the fl ow of materials  to   actual costs through 
</p>
<p>MFCA. MFCA,    developed in the late 1990s, is a tool for improving material 
</p>
<p> productivity in order to optimize the relative consumption of materials, energy 
</p>
<p>and water in the production process. It measures the fl ow and stock of materials in 
</p>
<p>both monetary and physical units such as weight and volume, facilitating the 
</p>
<p>understanding of the interconnectedness of environmental factors such as material 
</p>
<p>use and emissions to economic considerations. Under this approach, the full 
</p>
<p> economic cost of waste is made tangible by examining the cost of waste in the 
</p>
<p>purchase, production and disposal stages instead of simply calculating the cost of 
</p>
<p>the  disposal stage. 
</p>
<p> Experience demonstrates that material purchase costs and materials lost  as 
</p>
<p>  waste and emissions may account for signifi cant, and at times, the most signifi -
</p>
<p>cant cost drivers in different organizations. This may be particularly evident in 
</p>
<p>countries where other cost drivers such as labor costs are low. The MFCA  captures 
</p>
<p>all input and output materials in the MFA. Input materials include raw materials, 
</p>
<p>auxiliary materials, merchandise, packaging, operating materials, water, and 
</p>
<p>energy. Outputs are divided into product outputs that go into the fi nal product and 
</p>
<p>non-product outputs (waste, wastewater, and emissions). Successful implementa-
</p>
<p>tion of MFCA depends on inputs from both accounting and production, two parts 
</p>
<p>of the organization which do not necessarily share a synchronized information 
</p>
<p>system. Total  environmental costs include environmental protection expenditure 
</p>
<p>(end-of-pipe emissions treatment and waste prevention) as well as material fl ow 
</p>
<p>costs. Together these two account for the total corporate environmental costs 
</p>
<p>(Jasch  2008 ). 
</p>
<p> The integrated analysis of costs and  the   fl ows and stocks of materials in an orga-
</p>
<p>nization has proven to yield opportunities for economic and environmental savings 
</p>
<p>through resource effi ciency. The ISO 14051 standard published in 2011 was 
</p>
<p>designed as an internal environmental management accounting tool for organiza-
</p>
<p>tions ( ISO 14051 standard ). It provides a general framework for MFCA on an orga-
</p>
<p>nization level through a common terminology, principles, objectives, fundamental 
</p>
<p>elements and implementation steps.  The   ISO framework tracks and quantifi es in 
</p>
<p>physical units the fl ows and stocks of materials within an organization and their 
</p>
<p>V. Blass et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>105
</p>
<p>associated internal costs. External costs are outside the scope of the MFCA but can 
</p>
<p>be included if desired by the organization. It therefore promotes increased transpar-
</p>
<p>ency of material use practices (Kokubu and Tachikawa  2013 ). Organizations can 
</p>
<p>then use the information gathered to highlight opportunities to simultaneously gen-
</p>
<p>erate fi nancial benefi ts and reduce adverse environmental impacts such as waste 
</p>
<p>production.    The standard supports companies by providing a step by step guidance 
</p>
<p>to the  process through the different stages of an MFCA from guidance on building 
</p>
<p>a materials and energy fl ow model to guidance on the communication of the MFCA 
</p>
<p>results and the involvement of management. In addition, it includes some real exam-
</p>
<p>ples to better illustrate the process. 
</p>
<p> Another ISO standard, the ISO 14052 titled &ldquo;Environmental management&mdash;
</p>
<p>(MFCA)&mdash;Guidance for practical implementation in a supply chain&rdquo; is currently 
</p>
<p>being developed and planned to provide guidance on implementation of MFCA 
</p>
<p>along the supply chain. 
</p>
<p> The framework is relevant to organizations regardless of their products, services, 
</p>
<p>size, structure, location, and existing management and accounting systems. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, it can be extended to other organizations in the supply chain, both 
</p>
<p>upstream and downstream. The supply chain component can then inform the orga-
</p>
<p>nization and support decisions on an integrated approach to improving material and 
</p>
<p>energy effi ciency in the supply chain. For example, waste generation in an organi-
</p>
<p>zation is often determined by the nature or quality of materials provided by a sup-
</p>
<p>plier, or by the specifi cation of the product requested by a customer. 
</p>
<p>  Dedicated   software tools were developed to support the use of the framework 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Umberto&reg;). Examples of the use of MFCA encompass the manufacturing and 
</p>
<p>non-manufacturing industries and include opportunities in a multitude of processes, 
</p>
<p>such textile manufacturing, construction, cleaning, recycling, surface treating and 
</p>
<p>chemical reactions processes, machining and forming processes as well as logistics 
</p>
<p>and distribution. 
</p>
<p> In order to demonstrate the use of this tool, two examples of fi rms that applied it 
</p>
<p>in practice are provided. While the concept was fi rst developed in Germany, both 
</p>
<p>examples are from Japan, where the government has both actively promoted the 
</p>
<p>development of the ISO standard and identifi ed different case studies whose experi-
</p>
<p>ence contributed to the process of developing and fi ne-tuning the standard. 
</p>
<p>5.3.3.1     Using MFCA to Identify Waste Hotspots in a Pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>Product 
</p>
<p> The fi rst example,    the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, a manufacturer of 
</p>
<p>medical products in Japan, selected the production of a medical product for MFCA 
</p>
<p>analysis. The fi rm identifi ed the processes that generated the key waste manage-
</p>
<p>ment cost and the material loss cost in its production process. The process which 
</p>
<p>consists of the composition, refi nement, bulk pharmaceuticals, weighing capacity, 
</p>
<p>and formulation and packaging stages was outlined. Furthermore, the use of materi-
</p>
<p>als, auxiliary materials, reaction agents and solvents as well as packaging materials 
</p>
<p>5 Sustainable Non-Renewable Materials Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>106
</p>
<p>inputs into the process and all material losses were mapped for all production 
</p>
<p>phases. Waste management costs incurred in the composition process amounted to 
</p>
<p>126 million yen, while the cost of material losses from the composition to the bulk 
</p>
<p>pharmaceuticals processes amounted to 285 million yen. The identifi cation of these 
</p>
<p>waste hotspots led to changes in investment decisions and manufacturing opera-
</p>
<p>tions, resulting in a reduction in waste, reduction in chloroform emissions, signifi -
</p>
<p>cant reduction in CO 2  emissions and annual economic savings (METI  2010 ,  
</p>
<p> Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation company website ). The MFCA analysis can 
</p>
<p>support evaluation practices at the design phase as well as providing for a common 
</p>
<p>production indicator (METI  2010 ).  
</p>
<p>5.3.3.2     Using MFCA to Reduce Material Input Use through 
</p>
<p>Collaboration with a Supplier 
</p>
<p> The  second   example relates to an MFCA conducted jointly by Canon Inc. and its 
</p>
<p>glass material supplier. It highlighted the gap between input and output in the pro-
</p>
<p>duction process, indicating a much higher proportion of material loss rates than 
</p>
<p>previously estimated. The company looked at the MFCA of the production of the 
</p>
<p>lens used for a single-lens refl ex camera and a broadcast camera produced in Japan. 
</p>
<p>The process, including the stages of grinding, smoothing, polishing, centering and 
</p>
<p>coating, was analyzed for input materials and material losses. The analysis revealed 
</p>
<p>that material loss encompassed a third of the total material and that about 66 % of 
</p>
<p>the material losses were generated in the grinding phase, mainly in the form of cost 
</p>
<p>of the material and cost of disposal and treatment of liquid waste and sludge man-
</p>
<p>agement. Canon closely analyzed this information, and instituted improvement ini-
</p>
<p>tiatives for waste reduction in cooperation with the material supplier. Through 
</p>
<p>collaboration with the glass material supplier, innovative new materials for lens 
</p>
<p>production, known as &ldquo;Near-shaping,&rdquo; were developed. Raw material input was 
</p>
<p>reduced by a total of 85 % with a similar reduction in energy input. Waste volume 
</p>
<p>was reduced by 92 % and sludge volume was reduced by 50 %. Additional savings 
</p>
<p>were achieved through reduction in process costs (METI  2010 ). Changes due to the 
</p>
<p>MFCA saved a total of about 5.1 billion yen between 2004 and 2012 (Schmidt and 
</p>
<p>Michiyasu  2013 ). This example  highlights      the positive outcomes of applying this 
</p>
<p>analysis upstream on the supply chain through cooperation with a supplier.   
</p>
<p>5.3.4     Additional Tools for Material Flows Management 
</p>
<p>5.3.4.1     Materials Substitutes 
</p>
<p> While substitution may present an opportunity for addressing the scarcity of certain 
</p>
<p>materials, it can only provide such a solution, and an incomplete solution at that, in 
</p>
<p>certain cases. A study of the substitution potential of different metals in their major 
</p>
<p>uses around the globe highlighted that for 12 out of 62 different metals studied, the 
</p>
<p>V. Blass et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>107
</p>
<p>potential substitutes for their major uses are either inadequate or non-existent. The 
</p>
<p>study also found that for none of the 62 metals does one single substitute accom-
</p>
<p>modate all major uses (Graedel et al.  2015 ). 
</p>
<p> Finding substitutes is still a major challenge for industries, especially with regard 
</p>
<p>to the different properties of certain materials as well as their pricing and availabil-
</p>
<p>ity. Concepts such as Design for the Environment and tools such as LCA can help 
</p>
<p>R&amp;D teams and new technology teams to assess the true meaning of new substitute 
</p>
<p>options in terms of their cost and environmental perspectives and, in a more holistic 
</p>
<p>approach, also in terms of their social aspects.  
</p>
<p>5.3.4.2     Servicizing Examples for Dematerialization 
</p>
<p> Certain business models present a potential  for   dematerialization, or the reduction 
</p>
<p>of raw material use through a circular product lifecycle, which may include recy-
</p>
<p>cling, reuse, etc. 2  Servicizing presents one such example. Servicizing is a business 
</p>
<p>model defi ned as &ldquo;a transaction where value is provided through a combination of 
</p>
<p>products and services and where satisfaction of customer needs is achieved by 
</p>
<p> selling the product&rsquo;s function rather than product per se, and/or by increasing the 
</p>
<p>service component of the offer&rdquo; (SPREE Project  2012 ). Servicizing examples 
</p>
<p>showing a reduction  of   material use include the shift from selling printers to selling 
</p>
<p>documentation services by Xerox, which reduces material use for the production of 
</p>
<p>printers, copiers, paper and toners while also reducing solid waste generation. 
</p>
<p>Another example is the shift of Gage Products from selling chemical blends for 
</p>
<p>automotive paint applications to providing an effective paint shop operation 
</p>
<p>(i.e., providing the customer with a painted product). Material savings include lower 
</p>
<p>use of paint, solvents and cleaners (Rothenberg  2012 ). (See also Chap.   16     by Bellos 
</p>
<p>and Ferguson ( 2017 ) for more on servicizing.)  
</p>
<p>5.3.4.3     Increase Supply Chain Transparency and Accountability 
</p>
<p> Efforts have already been developed to  increase   supply chain transparency and 
</p>
<p>accountability in confl ict minerals through a process somewhat analogous to the 
</p>
<p>Kimberly Process established for other, more famous, minerals- diamonds. The 
</p>
<p>Kimberley Process was initiated in 2000 with the aim of stopping the trade in 
</p>
<p>&ldquo; confl ict diamonds&rdquo; and ensuring that diamond purchases were not fi nancing the 
</p>
<p>violation of human rights nor fueling rebel movements undermining governments 
</p>
<p>in production and trade countries. By 2002 an international certifi cation scheme, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;the Kimberley Process Certifi cation Scheme&rdquo; was established and implemented as 
</p>
<p>of 2003. The Kimberley Process (KP) was established through a multi-stakeholder

</p>
<p>99.8 % of the global production of rough diamonds. The process works through an 
</p>
<p>extensive list of requirements members have to meet to get certifi ed that the dia-
</p>
<p>monds are &ldquo;confl ict free&rdquo; (KP website    http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/about    ). 
</p>
<p> In order to assure due diligence along  the   supply chain of other minerals sources 
</p>
<p>for its industry, the USA has issued a rule on confl ict minerals in 2012. One of the 
</p>
<p>specifi c specialized disclosure provisions included in Title XV of the Dodd-Frank 
</p>
<p>Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is Section 1502 on confl ict min-
</p>
<p>erals, specifi cally tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. It requires annual disclosure of 
</p>
<p>whether any confl ict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production 
</p>
<p>of a product manufactured by an issuer originated in the Democratic Republic of 
</p>
<p>the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country. In case the minerals originated in the 
</p>
<p>DRC or an adjoining country, it requires a detailed report on measures taken to 
</p>
<p>exercise due diligence upstream on the source and chain of custody of those min-
</p>
<p>erals. At the international level, the OECD&rsquo;s Due Diligence Guidance for 
</p>
<p>Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Confl ict-Affected and High-Risk 
</p>
<p>Areas provides guidelines to multinational organizations on sourcing minerals 
</p>
<p>responsibly (OECD  2013 ). 
</p>
<p> The  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)   is another voluntary ini-
</p>
<p>tiative promoting a global standard seeking to improve transparency and account-
</p>
<p>ability in countries rich in oil, gas, and mineral resources. In each host country, the 
</p>
<p>EITI is supported by a coalition of governments, companies and civil society work-
</p>
<p>ing together. Once the EITI is endorsed in the country, its process becomes manda-
</p>
<p>tory for all extractive industry operators, private or state-owned, which operate 
</p>
<p>within that country. As of 2015, 31 countries have already become EITI compliant, 
</p>
<p>and 17 countries are currently candidate countries (EITI  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> The European Union has also enacted new disclosure requirements in 2013 in 
</p>
<p>order to improve the transparency of payments made to governments all over the 
</p>
<p>world by the extractive and logging industries. The objective of the disclosure is to 
</p>
<p>provide civil society in resource-rich countries with the necessary data and informa-
</p>
<p>tion required to assure governmental accountability for income made through the 
</p>
<p>exploitation of natural resources. The requirements also aim to promote the adop-
</p>
<p>tion of the EITI in those countries (European Commission  2013 ). Chapter   6     by 
</p>
<p>Bateman et al. ( 2017 ) provides more background on various disclosure require-
</p>
<p>ments in supply chains.    
</p>
<p>5.4     How Do Countries Manage Material Flows 
</p>
<p>at the Global Level? 
</p>
<p> In this section we outline additional tools that can help to manage and enhance sus-
</p>
<p>tainable raw materials management more broadly at the global level. We provide 
</p>
<p>insights into more targeted policy aspects and international trade issues.

<p>5.4.1     National Assessments and Policies 
</p>
<p>    The EU has recognized the growth in the number of materials used in products and 
</p>
<p>the need to reduce supply risk and strategically secure stable access to these raw 
</p>
<p>materials and resources for manufacturers in Europe. Therefore, as part of its strat-
</p>
<p>egy, it initiated the Raw Materials Initiative which manages raw materials issues at 
</p>
<p>an EU level. A subgroup of the Raw Materials Supply Group, specifi cally working 
</p>
<p>on defi ning critical raw materials, published its fi rst criticality analysis for raw 
</p>
<p>materials in 2010. The report focused on non-energy and non-food materials and 
</p>
<p>identifi ed 14 critical raw materials out of a list of 41 materials. 
</p>
<p> The list has been formally adopted by the European Commission which contin-
</p>
<p>ues to monitor criticality in order to determine priority actions. In a subsequent 
</p>
<p>review published in 2013, the same methodology, indicators and thresholds were 
</p>
<p>used to review a longer list of 54 raw materials in order to enable comparison of 
</p>
<p>criticality over time and implications for economic importance and supply risk cri-
</p>
<p>teria. It identifi ed 20 critical materials. Analysis of economic importance is con-
</p>
<p>ducted based on the proportion of each material associated with industrial 
</p>
<p>mega-sectors at an EU level. The proportions are then combined with the mega- 
</p>
<p>sectors&rsquo; gross value-added (GVA) to the EU&rsquo;s GDP. Finally the total is scaled 
</p>
<p>according to the total EU GDP so that an overall economic importance for a mate-
</p>
<p>rial can be defi ned. Supply risk of raw materials is based on the  World Governance 
</p>
<p>Indicator (WGI)   which takes into account a variety of infl uences including voice 
</p>
<p>and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effec-
</p>
<p>tiveness, and regulatory quality, rule of law or control of corruption. 3  Table  5.3  
</p>
<p>presents the different materials in the criticality reports of the EU (based on data 
</p>
<p>from the 2010 and 2013 reports).
</p>
<p>   The European Union&rsquo;s Critical Material  Studies   guides decision makers on con-
</p>
<p>fl ict minerals&rsquo; policy and industry on scarcity and trade implications. Comparing the 
</p>
<p>two reports can be instrumental in understanding what changes are taking place over 
</p>
<p>even a short period of time of 3 years. In 2000 42 materials were reviewed, and in 
</p>
<p>2013 already 54. Tantalum, a critical mineral in 2010 was no longer in the same level 
</p>
<p>of supply risk in 2013 and was removed from the list. Other minerals were added as 
</p>
<p>the scope grew and changes in the market were occurring enlarging the list to also 
</p>
<p>include Borates, Chromium, Coking Coal, Magnesite, Phosphate Rock and Silicon 
</p>
<p>Metal. This comparison clearly indicates that the status of minerals and their critical-
</p>
<p>ity cannot be considered as a static status and must be reviewed periodically. It 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the need for ongoing reviews both on a fi rm and a national level in order 
</p>
<p>to assure risk and management of minerals is up to date with global fl uctuations. 
</p>
<p> National level policy making can help to resolve some of the criticality chal-
</p>
<p>lenges. Table  5.3  outlines several points that elucidate the important connection 
</p>
<p>between companies and regulators in this policy arena. The table presents the 
</p>
<p> different goals and strategies governments adopted to face possible resource scarcity

<p>in specifi c materials of interest. It is clear that some materials are of interest to many 
</p>
<p>countries, however others are endemic to particular needs and expected demand. 
</p>
<p>This represents the importance for national analysis of the existing stock for each 
</p>
<p>material, its future use and possible barriers to its production and import, and ways 
</p>
<p>the government can overcome these challenges through substitution, recycling and 
</p>
<p>excavation, or through changes in consumption. Second, this table demonstrates the 
</p>
<p>need to align business policies and R&amp;D policies, within the  government and 
</p>
<p>through collaboration between supply chain managers, the academia, and govern-
</p>
<p>ment offi cials. For example, trade agreements may pose problems or opportunities 
</p>
<p>for supply of materials that companies rely on for their future production  processes   
</p>
<p>or upcoming technologies.  
</p>
<p>5.4.2     International Trade 
</p>
<p>    International trade restrictions may present a major challenge for fi rms as they may 
</p>
<p>create supply risk for manufacturers in one country and may secure preferential use 
</p>
<p>of the materials for manufacturers in another country. In 2012, the USA requested a 
</p>
<p>consultation through the World Trade Organization 4  with the People&rsquo;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>China regarding China&rsquo;s restrictions on rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum, 
</p>
<p>which are raw materials used in the production of various kinds of electronic goods 
</p>
<p>(WTO  2014 ). The following countries were third parties to the request: Brazil, 
</p>
<p>Canada, Colombia, European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Norway, Oman, Saudi 
</p>
<p>Arabia, Chinese Taipei, Viet Nam, Argentina, Australia, Indonesia, Turkey, Peru 
</p>
<p>and the Russian Federation. The listed restrictions included export duties, export 
</p>
<p>quotas, minimum export price requirements, export licensing requirements and 
</p>
<p>additional requirements and procedures in connection with the administration of the 
</p>
<p>quantitative restrictions. In 2014, the appellate body found that key measures were 
</p>
<p>inconsistent with WTO obligations. In December 2014, China and the USA agreed 
</p>
<p>that China would implement the recommendations and rulings of the Dispute 
</p>
<p>Settlement Body by May 2015 based on the argument that the restrictions were 
</p>
<p>designed to provide Chinese industries that produce downstream goods with pro-
</p>
<p>tected access to the subject materials. 
</p>
<p> International trade is also relevant in the case of waste streams and recycling 
</p>
<p>activities. For example, in 2013 China announced that it would tighten the enforce-
</p>
<p>ment of its recycling criteria for products and would no longer accept poorly sorted 
</p>
<p>or dirty shipments of recyclable waste from other countries around the world (Green 
</p>
<p>Fence Policy). The customs initiative does not present new legislation but rather 
</p>
<p>better enforcement to assure that the country will not continue to import harmful 
</p>
<p>waste products. China&rsquo;s initiative immediately provoked a strong reaction within 
</p>
<p>the country and abroad as it reshuffl ed the global recycling market by putting up a 
</p>
<p>4   The World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with the global rules of trade between nations. Its 
main function is to ensure that trade fl ows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.

</p>
<p>metaphorical fence in order to reject past practices of sending such harmful materials 
</p>
<p>to China. The initiative  disrupted   existing waste streams fl ows and has already 
</p>
<p>required other countries to reconsider their waste export strategy and shift scrap 
</p>
<p>waste to destinations other than China (Bureau of International Recycling  2013 ).   
</p>
<p>5.5     What&rsquo;s Next? 
</p>
<p> Based on this chapter review, and looking forward to the topic of sustainable mate-
</p>
<p>rials management, we outline in this summary section topics that require further 
</p>
<p>thinking, research, and practical solutions as the next step for advancing raw materi-
</p>
<p>als management for sustainable supply chains. 
</p>
<p> We start with a few questions that are relevant to the fi rm perspective, as the user 
</p>
<p>of the raw materials:
</p>
<p>&bull;     How can fi rms internalize    material issues :   Many of the issues discussed in this 
</p>
<p>chapter are still not common knowledge for procurement managers, designers, 
</p>
<p>and supply chain managers. In order to understand the local and global trends 
</p>
<p>and take actions, fi rms need simple tools that will help them assess their situa-
</p>
<p>tion and act on it in the most relevant way, both internally within the fi rm and 
</p>
<p>externally to it.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Practical use of MFA at the    fi rm and supply chain levels :   As presented, there 
</p>
<p>is already a vast body of research and fi ndings on the use of MFA methodol-
</p>
<p>ogy, and fi rms can use these studies in various ways. However, thus far, MFAs 
</p>
<p>have mainly been conducted at the national and regional levels. Much less 
</p>
<p>work has been done at the fi rm level. Further work that concentrates on the 
</p>
<p>supply chain level and the fi rm level will give higher value to fi rms and will 
</p>
<p>increase their understanding of the importance of this tool for decision mak-
</p>
<p>ing. It will help them to better understand such questions as: &ldquo;what are the 
</p>
<p>specifi c implications and concerns with regards to the materials I use in my 
</p>
<p>products.&rdquo;  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Questions for fi rms to ask : Firms that are newly introduced to this topic should 
</p>
<p>ask some guiding  questions   to help those set priorities and better understand their 
</p>
<p>pathways. We outline below some of these main questions and thoughts (par-
</p>
<p>tially adopted from DEFRA  2012 ).
</p>
<p> &ndash;    Are we relying on domestic or imported materials? Domestic supply offers 
</p>
<p>greater security, while imported resources may be at risk due to geopolitical 
</p>
<p>issues, or protectionist policies from key supplying countries.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   Can the government help us secure the availability of some materials? 
</p>
<p>Regulatory and government policy may have resource availability impli-
</p>
<p>cations as it may impact on supply or increase demand for particular 
</p>
<p>resources.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   Can we change our products and use material substitutes? Businesses will 
</p>
<p>need to identify alternative sources domestically and/or internationally, while 
</p>

<p>114
</p>
<p>also bearing in mind issues relating to the time lag of developing a new mine, 
</p>
<p>for example.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   Are we innovative enough? Businesses may need to invest further in process 
</p>
<p>or production innovation and recycling technologies of materials.       
</p>
<p> At a higher level, some actions require attention:
</p>
<p>&bull;     Integration of data on raw materials :    Currently very little is known about materi-
</p>
<p>als in large scales, especially the environmental and social impacts nexus. 
</p>
<p>Integration of data and information regarding material fl ows, consumption rates, 
</p>
<p>technological cycles, availability, criticality, etc., sorted by materials, by indus-
</p>
<p>tries, and by nations, would require meta-level coordination between different 
</p>
<p>organizations. However, since the body of knowledge in this area is still concen-
</p>
<p>trated, this could provide an opportunity for reorganizing the data and collecting 
</p>
<p>it in ways that are more accessible to the different stakeholders involved  in   col-
</p>
<p>lecting and using the data.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    What innovation is needed more specifi cally ? Three forms  of   innovation should 
</p>
<p>be encouraged by nations and by industrial associations:
</p>
<p>&bull;    New recycling technologies for materials currently not recycled.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Small-scale recycling operations that will be economic and will help coun-
</p>
<p>tries that are poor in local resources to maintain the materials within the coun-
</p>
<p>try at the end-of-life stage.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   New substitutes for existing and new industries.     
</p>
<p>&bull;    Needed collaboration :    Since some material issues are global, some regional, and 
</p>
<p>some sector-specifi c, sector level &ldquo;think-tank&rdquo; groups could be very effective in 
</p>
<p>reaching a solution (for example, the process of fi nding substitutes for the ROHS 
</p>
<p>banned materials in the electronics sector was a collaborative action in some cases).  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Needed research : Empirical work on material fl ows and risks at the fi rm and sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain levels is currently fairy limited. It is necessary to extend this body of 
</p>
<p>work and to include more disciplines (such as policy, law, international trade, 
</p>
<p>economics, etc.) in order to better research this topic in collaboration with indus-
</p>
<p>try and governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Urban mining is not just a buzz word : The concept  of   urban mining is becoming 
</p>
<p>much more relevant, especially within regions poor in local resources. At one 
</p>
<p>end, new collection and recycling schemes for different product waste streams 
</p>
<p>must be developed on a large scale. At the other end, new technologies for min-
</p>
<p>ing landfi lls must be developed and deployed. Landfi ll sites can become a major 
</p>

</p>
<p>6.1          Why Do Firms Disclose? 
</p>
<p> Environmental disclosure and reporting can be broadly defi ned as the various 
</p>
<p> methods that businesses use to communicate their environmental impacts, responsi-
</p>
<p>bilities, and mitigation activities to  stakeholders  . Although practitioners often use 
</p>
<p>the words &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; and &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; interchangeably, they can be distinguished 
</p>
<p>in terms of &ldquo;what&rdquo; is communicated versus &ldquo;how&rdquo; it is communicated.  Disclosure  
</p>
<p>involves previously unknown, secret, or proprietary information. In contrast,  report-
</p>
<p>ing  is the communication process&mdash;often structured&mdash;by which the disclosed infor-
</p>
<p>mation is transmitted to the public, shareholders, stakeholders, or governments. The 
</p>
<p>decision of what and when to disclose is specifi c to each setting; companies make 
</p>
<p>disclosure decisions while considering internal objectives, external pressure, and 
</p>
<p>regulatory requirements. And the decision of how to report these disclosures is simi-
</p>
<p>larly a function of internal and external forces. 
</p>
<p>  Non-fi nancial reporting   largely started in Europe in 1970s Germany with social 
</p>
<p>reporting and the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>(OECD)   Social Indicators reporting program. Regulatory disclosure gained momen-
</p>
<p>tum in the United States during the 1980s with the &ldquo;right to know&rdquo; legislation set forth 
</p>
<p>in the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. This legislation established 
</p>
<p>the  Toxic Release Inventory  , wherein companies were asked to disclose the produc-
</p>
<p>tion and release of toxic chemicals (EPA  2015 ). Then, in 1989, voluntary reporting 
</p>
<p>further came into focus in the United States following the massive oil spill by Exxon 
</p>
<p>Valdez. The Valdez Principles were introduced by the  Coalition for Environmentally 
</p>
<p>Responsible Economies (CERES)  , which outlined the fi rst major environmental 
</p>
<p> conduct and reporting practices specifi cally for companies (Sanyal and Neves  1991 ).

</p>
<p>At the international level, the United Nations Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the 
</p>
<p>Rio+20 Summit in 2012 have encouraged companies to act and be accountable 
</p>
<p>through reporting on social and environmental responsibility (UNEP  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> The  driving forces   for environmental sustainability reporting and corporate 
</p>
<p>disclosure of other types of information are not different. However, unlike other 
</p>
<p>information disclosed by companies, stakeholder pressure and brand positioning 
</p>
<p>have been the dominant forces for environmental sustainability disclosure. 
</p>
<p>Environmental reporting is a relatively recent practice that is often complex and 
</p>
<p>hard to verify, requiring data from multiple supply chain partners. Often, it is dif-
</p>
<p>fi cult for an organization to navigate the increasing number of reporting and dis-
</p>
<p>closure alternatives available. 
</p>
<p> Private fi rms are used to disclosing information on their activities. Companies 
</p>
<p>disclose for four primary  reasons  : (1) to satisfy requirements imposed by govern-
</p>
<p>ments and regulators; (2) to satisfy requirements from shareholders; (3) to commu-
</p>
<p>nicate attributes of the brand, products or services to current and future customers 
</p>
<p>and consumers; and (4) to mitigate reputational risks with other stakeholders such 
</p>
<p>as NGOs, the communities in which they operate, their own employees, and the 
</p>
<p>public at large. 
</p>
<p> In general, environmental disclosure and reporting rates are high in the developed 
</p>
<p>world. According to the consulting fi rm  KPMG  , companies reported at rates of 86 % 
</p>
<p>in the United States and 91 % in the United Kingdom in 2013 (KPMG  2013 ). Even 
</p>
<p>more promising is the rapid growth of companies reporting in the developing areas 
</p>
<p>of the world, such as Asia Pacifi c. For example, rates of companies reporting in 
</p>
<p>China increased from 59 % in 2011 to 75 % in 2013. While the growing global rates 
</p>
<p>of environmental reporting are encouraging, they largely represent reporting limited 
</p>
<p>to the company level without addressing the impacts of the supply chain. 
</p>
<p>6.1.1     Regulatory Disclosures 
</p>
<p> Although many companies are choosing to report voluntarily or due to pressure 
</p>
<p>from external stakeholders, there are  governmental policies   that force companies to 
</p>
<p>report on specifi c environmental practices or impacts. If a company is found to be in 
</p>
<p>noncompliance, it can, in some cases, be penalized. Most existing policies require 
</p>
<p>disclosure only on the company&rsquo;s own internal practices, not on the practices of 
</p>
<p>external partners along the supply chain. However, the requirement to disclose inter-
</p>
<p>nal practices forces companies to reevaluate processes that may be substandard, and 
</p>
<p>may force them to look into those same practices in their supply chains. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>regulation can vary across cities, states, and countries; this variability holds  multina-
</p>
<p>tional companies   to a multiplicity of regulatory mandates. Some examples of this 
</p>
<p>include the  European Union&rsquo;s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and 
</p>
<p>Restriction of Chemicals Act (REACH)  , France&rsquo;s Grenelle II Act, the United States&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank Act, and California&rsquo;s AB 32 Global Warming Solutions Act. 
</p>
<p> As an example of basic disclosure policies, the  REACH Act   requires companies 
</p>
<p>to report their use of specifi c chemicals and the measures in place to handle them 
</p>
<p>A.H. Bateman et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>121
</p>
<p>safely. The requirements of this act are based on the quantity of the chemical used 
</p>
<p>and the risk associated with the chemical (Europa  2014 ). Companies are required to 
</p>
<p>report this information; the information is then included in a public repository man-
</p>
<p>aged by the  European Union (EU)  . This  repository   includes information about 
</p>
<p>quantity, use, and emergency management plans for chemicals used in European 
</p>
<p>operations and products. In addition, if products contain one or more of the 161 
</p>
<p>chemicals that are classifi ed as  substances of very high concern (SVHC)      at a quan-
</p>
<p>tity above a 0.1 % weight-by-weight threshold, this information must be communi-
</p>
<p>cated to the consumer. For example, because it sells its computers in Europe, Dell 
</p>
<p>complied with this requirement by reporting on its website that none of its products 
</p>
<p>contained any SVHC above the required threshold (DELL  2010 ). In addition to the 
</p>
<p>reporting of chemicals used in operations and products, the REACH Act also 
</p>
<p>includes in its Annex XVII a list of outlawed chemicals that include chemicals like 
</p>
<p>mercury and chloroform (European Chemical Agency  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Some governments have taken mandatory environmental disclosures a step fur-
</p>
<p>ther. Similar to the objective of reporting platforms like the  Global Reporting 
</p>
<p>Initiative (GRI)   and the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project)   , the French 
</p>
<p>government made company-wide environmental reporting mandatory. Under 
</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy, the French government created the Grenelle de 
</p>
<p>l&rsquo;environnement, a French roundtable on sustainable development, in 2007. Through 
</p>
<p>this roundtable, a series of national environmental commitments was created. 
</p>
<p>Released in 2012, Article 225 of the Grenelle II Act requires companies to report on 
</p>
<p>their environmental practices (IRSE  2012 ). It mandates that French companies with 
</p>
<p>500 or more employees must produce an annual report that includes third-party vet-
</p>
<p>ted environmental, social, and governance indicators. Although many parts of the 
</p>
<p>Grenelle regulation have yet to be enacted, the reporting component of the regula-
</p>
<p>tory mandates was implemented and companies are complying. 
</p>
<p> The French government also proposed regulation to achieve higher levels of  cor-
</p>
<p>porate transparency  . Based on pilot projects in 2011, legislation was planned for a 
</p>
<p>multi-criteria product label that would include information on carbon footprint, 
</p>
<p>water use, and biodiversity impacts across the entire supply chain (Department of 
</p>
<p>the Commissioner-General for Sustainable Development  2012 ). Given the rigorous, 
</p>
<p>costly, and time-consuming nature of this data collection, this part of the legislation 
</p>
<p>had not been put into place at the time of this writing (2015). 
</p>
<p> In the United States, the  Dodd-Frank Act   became one of the fi rst regulatory man-
</p>
<p>dates to (indirectly) require companies to deeply examine their supply chains. The 
</p>
<p>act is actually a fi nancial disclosure policy, but Section 1502 of the Act requires 
</p>
<p>companies to report whether any of their products contain confl ict minerals (GPO 
</p>
<p> 2012 ). Confl ict minerals include tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold sourced from con-
</p>
<p>fl ict regions in the Democratic Republic of Congo. These minerals are used to make 
</p>
<p>anything from smartphones to jewelry. The main suppliers of these  minerals   are 
</p>
<p>commonly four or fi ve tiers deep in a brand owner&rsquo;s supply chain. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>although the requirement sounds straightforward, it requires companies to conduct 
</p>
<p>investigations into often highly complex and impermeable supply chains of smelters, 
</p>
<p>primary metals processors, component makers, and interconnecting import/export 
</p>
<p>fi rms. Moreover, even when a primary supplier of a mineral has been identifi ed, the 
</p>
<p>6 Disclosing and Reporting Environmental Sustainability of Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>122
</p>
<p>reporting company still may not know whether the mineral was sourced from a 
</p>
<p>confl ict region or not, due to the highly secretive and opaque nature of the industry 
</p>
<p>(Businessweek  2014 ). Chapter   5     by Blass et al. ( 2017 ) discusses material fl ows and 
</p>
<p>regulations surrounding such  non-renewable materials   in more detail. 
</p>
<p> Although the mandate only requires that companies establish whether or not they 
</p>
<p>use any confl ict minerals in their products, most companies also want to avoid the 
</p>
<p>use of confl ict minerals in their products. Phasing out sources of confl ict minerals 
</p>
<p>includes working with industry groups like the  Electronics Industry Citizenship 
</p>
<p>Council (EICC)   to audit smelters (the linchpin in the confl ict mineral supply chain) 
</p>
<p>to provide transparency onto the source of minerals and allow companies to pur-
</p>
<p>chase confl ict-free minerals (Businessweek  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> At the state level, the state of California enacted the California Global Warming 
</p>
<p>Solutions Act, AB 32 (CARB  2014a ,  b ), in 2006. This policy requires that all indus-
</p>
<p>trial facilities, fuel suppliers, and electricity importers report  greenhouse gas emis-
</p>
<p>sions (GHG emissions)   annually through the  California Reporting System  . The 
</p>
<p>policy came into force in 2008 and remains a requirement. California then took the 
</p>
<p>reporting requirement a step further, by requiring emissions reductions across the 
</p>
<p>same sources through a cap-and-trade program. 
</p>
<p> California&rsquo;s  cap-and-trade program   requires that businesses and organizations 
</p>
<p>comply with a reduction of GHGs to 1990 levels by the year 2020 (CARB  2014b ). 
</p>
<p>The requirement, which began in 2013 for electric utilities and industrial facilities, 
</p>
<p>requires about a 3 % reduction annually through carbon pricing. The mandate to 
</p>
<p>reduce annual levels will potentially lead to investment in clean technologies. In 
</p>
<p>2015, the policy will expand to distributors of transportation, natural gas and other 
</p>
<p>fuels (CARB  2011 ).  Policy frameworks   such as AB 32 guide companies from mere 
</p>
<p>disclosure toward substantive emissions reductions. This type of regulatory frame-
</p>
<p>work can be successful because it links reporting with management, as the reporting 
</p>
<p>process itself reveals areas that need improvement. While fi ndings on success are 
</p>
<p>limited at this time, the system has been broadly adopted across the state.  
</p>
<p>6.1.2     Additional Pressure to Report 
</p>
<p> While regulations require companies to report on impacts of their operations, there 
</p>
<p>are additional pressures that encourage companies to report voluntarily. 
</p>
<p> These include two main mechanisms: (a) multi-stakeholder public agreements 
</p>
<p>and (b) shareholder engagement. 
</p>
<p>6.1.2.1      Multi-Stakeholder Public Agreements      
</p>
<p> Multi-stakeholder public agreements refer to environmental commitments by a 
</p>
<p>fi rm through engagement of public, private, and nongovernmental actors&rsquo; con-
</p>
<p>cerns. By bringing together a diverse group of key stakeholders, company leaders

</p>
<p>can argue a market interest, or at least mitigate any risks of being left behind, when 
</p>
<p>explaining environmental commitments to shareholders and employees. By com-
</p>
<p>mitting to a path of improvement, companies are implicitly committing to mea-
</p>
<p>sure, disclose, and ultimately make progress&mdash;voluntarily&mdash;on well-defi ned 
</p>
<p>environmental issues. 
</p>
<p> For instance, on January 31, 1999, Secretary-General Kofi  Annan announced the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Global Compact. The Compact is an initiative to encourage busi-
</p>
<p>nesses and other organizations worldwide to both adopt sustainable and socially 
</p>
<p>responsible policies and to report on their practices. The Compact is based on ten 
</p>
<p>principles within the four major categories of human rights, labor, environment, and 
</p>
<p>anti-corruption (UN Global Compact  2015 ). Under the environmental principles, 
</p>
<p>the Global Compact suggests companies should report on their precautionary 
</p>
<p>approach to environmental challenges, on initiatives to promote greater environ-
</p>
<p>mental responsibility, and on the diffusion of environmentally friendly technolo-
</p>
<p>gies. Under each of these principles, companies should describe their assessment, 
</p>
<p>policies and goals; implementation; and measurement of outcomes in their reports. 
</p>
<p>By reporting on its four main categories and their ten sub-principles, an organiza-
</p>
<p>tion will be able to communicate progress to its stakeholders as well as maintain an 
</p>
<p>Active Status under the Global Compact. 
</p>
<p> With 12,000 companies and organizations from over 145 countries as participants, 
</p>
<p>the Compact represents the largest voluntary initiative established thus far. As a part of 
</p>
<p>its framework, the Compact includes a policy called the  Communication on Progress 
</p>
<p>(COP)  . The COP requires participants to increase their transparency and disclose their 
</p>
<p>progress towards achieving the framework principles. If a company does not report its 
</p>
<p>progress, it will no longer be considered a participant in the Compact. This  and      similar 
</p>
<p>global initiatives have led to increasing rates of corporate reporting globally.  
</p>
<p>6.1.2.2     Shareholder Pressure 
</p>
<p> A more direct way to establish pressure for companies to report  environmental 
</p>
<p>impacts and drive reductions   is to engage shareholders. Managers in public and 
</p>
<p>private companies have a fi duciary responsibility toward shareholders, both for the 
</p>
<p>short- and long-term fi nancial viability of the business. Whenever environmental 
</p>
<p>concerns can be connected with the long-term viability of the business, and share-
</p>
<p>holders are also aligned with this view, managers will be required to start measuring 
</p>
<p>and reporting their environmental impacts. 
</p>
<p> However, it remains highly unclear whether corporate environmental reporting 
</p>
<p>has signifi cant impact on consumer choice or investor practices. Examining a lim-
</p>
<p>ited set of companies listed in the FTSE 250 of the London Stock Exchange, 
</p>
<p>Haddock-Fraser and Fraser ( 2008 ) found that consumer-facing companies were 
</p>
<p>more likely to report than those that operating in a business-to-business setting. 
</p>
<p>Given their analysis of listed companies, the authors conclude that &ldquo; higher-turnover, 
</p>
<p>public-listed companies&rdquo;   include consumers in their decision to report environmen-
</p>
<p>tal practices (Haddock-Fraser and Fraser  2008 : 153).

</p>
<p> In most cases, the shareholder perception of corporate social responsibility 
</p>
<p>( CSR)      and embedded activities, including reporting, is neutral as long as these prin-
</p>
<p>ciples and activities increase shareholder value. However, some studies fi nd that a 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s decision to report and pursue environmentally focused activities may be 
</p>
<p>negatively interpreted by shareholders due to the perception that any dollar spent 
</p>
<p>toward environmentally and socially responsible activities may be seen as decreas-
</p>
<p>ing shareholder profi t (Barnea and Rubin  2010 ). In Chap.   14    , Jacobs et al. ( 2017 ) 
</p>
<p>also fi nd mixed evidence for how the stock market responds to environmental 
</p>
<p>initiatives. 
</p>
<p> In both the consumer and shareholder pressure driven cases, only limited 
</p>
<p>research, and a company&rsquo;s perception of the issue, informs the decision of whether 
</p>
<p>or not to report. This means that a company&rsquo;s decision is often based on anecdotal 
</p>
<p>evidence and perceived pressures from different sources. 
</p>
<p>   The Dow Jones Sustainability Indices 
</p>
<p> The Dow Jones Sustainability Indices ( DJSI)      is a group of sustainability perfor-
</p>
<p>mance indices that evaluate environmental performance of companies listed on the 
</p>
<p>Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index (DJSI). Launched in 1999, the DJSI 
</p>
<p>evaluates corporate environmental and social attributes in conjunction with eco-
</p>
<p>nomic performance (DJSI  2015 ). Focusing on shareholder interests, the DJSI is the 
</p>
<p>fi rst set of global indices to track sustainability in companies. Although fi nancial 
</p>
<p>performance is a big part of the index, issues assessed include, but are not limited 
</p>
<p>to, supply chain standards, risk management, and climate change mitigation. The 
</p>
<p>DJSI uses both general and industry-specifi c criteria for evaluation. In addition to 
</p>
<p>the main index, DJSI also has several geographically focused indices including Asia 
</p>
<p>Pacifi c, Emerging Markets, Europe, North America, Australia, Korea, and Nordic. 
</p>
<p>In addition, it manages industry indices, also known as &ldquo;blue chip indices.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> In 2012, the Dow Jones merged with the S&amp;P Indices to become the S&amp;P Dow 
</p>
<p>Jones Indices. Together with Robeco SAM, an investment specialist for sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity, they created &ldquo;objective benchmarks for managing sustainability investment 
</p>
<p>portfolios&rdquo; (DJSI  2014 ). The DJSI selects over 3000 publicly traded companies to 
</p>
<p>report on their sustainability practices; 800 of these companies are located in emerg-
</p>
<p>ing markets (DJSI  2013 ). The corporate sustainability assessment identifi es leaders 
</p>
<p>across 59 industry groups, based on methodology that includes both general and 
</p>
<p>industry-specifi c sustainability trends. Selecting companies for the DJSI index 
</p>
<p>involves rating companies on a Total Sustainability Score based on Robeco SAM&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>Corporate Sustainability Index. The annual process begins in March, and scores are 
</p>
<p>released in September of the same year. In 2014, DJSI released the results of the 
</p>
<p>assessment by announcing the top companies in 24 industry groups. Awardees 
</p>
<p>included Siemens AG in Capital Goods; Unilever NV in Food, Beverage and 
</p>
<p>Tobacco; and  Kao      Corporation in Household &amp; Personal Products.

<p>6.1.3     Report or  Explain   
</p>
<p> In most cases, companies are faced with overlapping voluntary initiatives and man-
</p>
<p>datory regulations. For example, in India, government guidelines are designed to 
</p>
<p>promote voluntary reporting and responsible business. However, Indian policy also 
</p>
<p>dictates that the top one hundred publicly listed companies report their social and 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts (UNEP  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> To promote compliance while allowing fl exibility, an increasingly common prac-
</p>
<p>tice in some parts of the world is the &ldquo;report or explain&rdquo; principle (GRI  2011 ). For 
</p>
<p>example, this practice is included in Denmark&rsquo;s Financial Statements Act, which 
</p>
<p>requires the largest companies to disclose sustainability information. The principle 
</p>
<p>directs that companies should report where possible and explain if they are incapa-
</p>
<p>ble of reporting on some issues. An inability to report may be due to limited capa-
</p>
<p>bilities or capacity to report at the time of compliance. However, the principle 
</p>
<p>includes the expectation that reports will improve over time with increasing levels 
</p>
<p>of disclosure through increased training and capacity in the area of reporting (GRI 
</p>
<p> 2011 ). The practice became popular because of its fl exibility and ability to allow 
</p>
<p>companies to grow into high quality reporting practices, and it was highlighted at 
</p>
<p>the Rio+20 United Nations Summit in 2012. However, allowing companies to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;explain&rdquo; can also be seen as a delaying tactic by which some companies can put off 
</p>
<p>disclosing their impacts, especially if there are no penalties for non-reporting. 
</p>
<p> Businesses also receive pressure to report from stakeholders including consum-
</p>
<p>ers, investors, NGOs, or even their own employees. There is an increased awareness 
</p>
<p>in civil society of the role of business in sustainability. Through social media and the 
</p>
<p>Internet, environmental organizations have engaged consumers in their fi ght. 
</p>
<p>Environmental NGOs push for transparency and accountability from companies 
</p>
<p>(Buckley  2002 ). With both brand reputation and consumer loyalty at risk, compa-
</p>
<p>nies (especially those that are consumer facing) are responding to this pressure. 
</p>
<p> In some countries, stock exchanges require companies to disclose environmental 
</p>
<p>information. The  Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)   requires companies to dis-
</p>
<p>close if they have environmental and/or social sustainability risks, while the Swedish 
</p>
<p>OMX reserves the right to delist companies that have social and environmental 
</p>
<p>violations (INI 2014). In addition, in cases where reporting is growing within an 
</p>
<p>industry, a company may report to avoid being  seen   as a laggard (MacLean and 
</p>
<p>Rebernak  2007 ). Whether companies are faced with some or all of these pressures, 
</p>
<p>many are complying with requests to disclose and report their environmental 
</p>
<p>impacts. However, these disclosures vary widely in breadth and quality.  
</p>
<p>6.1.4     Variability of  Reporting   
</p>
<p> Reporting companies disclose environmental information in several different ways: 
</p>
<p>by publishing quantitative metrics, by comparing performance with set targets, 
</p>
<p>through third-party verifi cation, and by means of environmental cost accounting 
</p>
<p>(OECD  2003 ). 
</p>
<p>6 Disclosing and Reporting Environmental Sustainability of Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>126
</p>
<p> In reporting, most companies only account for their own operations, not for the 
</p>
<p>entire supply chain. Many critics of standard reporting suggest that assessments 
</p>
<p>scoped at the company level misses far too much and does not account for the sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain at all (Ethical Corporation  2013 ). Some suggest this oversight can be 
</p>
<p>eliminated through full product transparency, which is often seen as the future of 
</p>
<p>reporting. Using this method, a company must report the impacts at every phase of 
</p>
<p>the supply chain for each product. Companies can account for the full life cycle of 
</p>
<p>their product through a  life cycle assessment (LCA)  , which is a methodology to 
</p>
<p>meticulously enumerate and aggregate the various impacts of a product at each 
</p>
<p>stage of its life cycle (see Sect.  6.2  for more on practices). Full transparency onto a 
</p>
<p>product&rsquo;s life cycle would, in effect, achieve the highest level of transparency for 
</p>
<p>reporting. However, many companies are reluctant to take on this challenge due to 
</p>
<p>the signifi cant time and expense of the analysis. 
</p>
<p> There is momentum toward global standardized reporting. Some barriers, how-
</p>
<p>ever, exist to standardization. These barriers range from limited know-how, to data 
</p>
<p>collection time constraints, to the multiplicity of standards and platforms.  Additional   
</p>
<p>staff or increased training may be required to take on the new task of collecting, 
</p>
<p>analyzing, and reporting data. Even if there is support, appropriate systems may not 
</p>
<p>be in place to collect the data. Executive support and time allocation to review and 
</p>
<p>approve reports may be limited. Moreover, additional time and costs are also embed-
</p>
<p>ded in preparing the report and having it verifi ed or audited for legitimacy. 
</p>
<p> The multiplicity of competing reporting standards and  organizations   also works 
</p>
<p>against the goal of reporting (see Table  6.1  for a snapshot of some examples of this 
</p>
<p>multiplicity). Different content, requirements, and audiences challenge businesses

</p>
<p>to select and commit to a reporting format. However, in recent years, some of the 
</p>
<p>main reporting mechanisms&mdash;including the GRI, the CDP, and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Global Compact&mdash;have made efforts to align information required to facilitate 
</p>
<p>translation between standards (UNEP  2014 ). Initiatives like these are contributing 
</p>
<p>to better alignment for corporate standardized reporting.
</p>
<p>6.2          Methods of Disclosing and Reporting 
</p>
<p> Companies can take a variety of routes to disclose and report their environmental 
</p>
<p>impacts. The method for how to assess and what to report is based on a company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>preferences. The most popular method is the CSR report as a supplement to the 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s annual fi nancial report. Some companies use general and area-specifi c 
</p>
<p>protocols and guidelines to formulate their reports, including the GRI, the 
</p>
<p>Greenhouse Gas Protocol, and the  Water Footprint Network (WFN)  . Protocols 
</p>
<p>guide how and what to assess and report. Once a company has assessed its impacts, 
</p>
<p>corporate decision makers can then choose to report solely through their individual 
</p>
<p>reports or to disclose their impacts through a variety of platforms. The GRI serves 
</p>
<p>as both a set of guidelines and a reporting platform for general sustainability indica-
</p>
<p>tors. For carbon reporting, the CDP and SmartWay serve as reporting platforms. For 
</p>
<p>water, the WFN serves as the protocol to assess water and wastewater, while the 
</p>
<p>CDP serves as a platform for reporting. 
</p>
<p>6.2.1      Firm Reporting   
</p>
<p> CSR reports have been and are the traditional way for companies to voluntarily 
</p>
<p>disclose information to a variety of stakeholders about their non-fi nancial perfor-
</p>
<p>mance. CSR reports not only disclose social and environmental activities, they may 
</p>
<p>also recognize achievements by employees beyond their day-to-day responsibili-
</p>
<p>ties. CSR reports are very often &ldquo;free-form&rdquo;; a company can choose to include any 
</p>
<p>activity it considers worth sharing with external and internal stakeholders. CSR 
</p>
<p>reports are also marketing-driven and not necessarily connected with fi rm opera-
</p>
<p>tions or the corporate mission. 
</p>
<p> Most companies report some quantitative metrics that serve as indicators for 
</p>
<p>their environmental impacts. These metrics may be potentially comparable across 
</p>
<p>an industry if peer companies use the same metric. The metrics might cover CO 2  
</p>
<p>emissions, water usage, waste generation, and others. Companies may also create 
</p>
<p>targets and goals. For example, Johnson and Johnson, a health products company, 
</p>
<p>proposed to achieve a 20 % absolute reduction of facilities CO 2  emissions by 2020, 
</p>
<p>from a baseline of 2010 (Johnson and Johnson  2014 ). This makes it easier for exter-
</p>
<p>nal stakeholders to gauge progress relative to the metrics the companies are report-
</p>
<p>6 Disclosing and Reporting Environmental Sustainability of Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>128
</p>
<p>ing. In addition to the most common practices of environmental metrics and target 
</p>
<p>setting, companies may also engage third parties to verify their reports and validate 
</p>
<p>their accuracy with organizations such as Trucost (Trucost  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> A fi nal method of reporting is environmental cost accounting. This means that 
</p>
<p>the companies also include information on fi nancial and non-fi nancial costs and 
</p>
<p>benefi ts of a company&rsquo;s environmental strategy (OECD 2013). For example, General 
</p>
<p>Motors reported saving $1 billion a year through reuse and recycling of by-products 
</p>
<p>through waste avoidance (Triple Pundit  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> The type and breadth of information shared in CSR reports varies widely. For 
</p>
<p>example, Seventh Generation, an environmentally focused homecare company, 
</p>
<p>includes information ranging from product formulas and data on environmentally 
</p>
<p>sensitive materials sourcing to community engagement information (Seventh 
</p>
<p>Generation  2013 ). The report covers goals set by the company, highlights its prog-
</p>
<p>ress towards these goals, and provides qualitative coverage of environmental and 
</p>
<p>social action throughout the company. 
</p>
<p> On the other hand, CSR reports can be quite limited, and their quality can vary 
</p>
<p>greatly over time. In 2010,  British Petroleum (BP)   released a  sustainability   report 
</p>
<p>that addressed its role in the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill without reporting the exten-
</p>
<p>sive environmental consequences of the amount of oil spilled in the gulf. The report 
</p>
<p>also failed to disclose the amount of CO 2  or methane released as a consequence of 
</p>
<p>the spill, and it only set forth a single and vague environmental goal (BP  2010 ). 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the report included minimal stakeholder input. Although BP&rsquo;s report 
</p>
<p>was considerably lacking, the oil and gas giant had actually been long considered a 
</p>
<p>leader in reporting, releasing one of the fi rst major sustainability reports in 1998. BP 
</p>
<p>also received reporting awards in subsequent years (Triple  2015 ). 
</p>
<p> Other companies opt to commit to many different goals; for example, Marks and 
</p>
<p>Spencer proposed 100 different commitments that it reports on annually. These 
</p>
<p>commitments include, but are not limited to, improving building energy effi ciency, 
</p>
<p>reducing food waste, and achieving zero-carbon operations. The 2014 report high-
</p>
<p>lighted company goals and the annual progress achieved on each. That report dis-
</p>
<p>closed that 12 commitments were incomplete, 9 were fully achieved, and 79 were 
</p>
<p>on track to be fi nished by the proposed deadline (Marks and Spencer  2014 ). For 
</p>
<p>example, the goal that 50 % of cotton used would be sourced sustainably by 2020 
</p>
<p>had achieved a rate of 20 % by 2014. Marks and Spencer&rsquo;s UK emissions totaled 
</p>
<p>533,000 t of CO 2  in 2014, down from 698,000 t in 2006; this represents an overall 
</p>
<p>reduction of 37 % with a fi nal goal of carbon neutral operations in 2020. The com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s zero-waste-to-landfi ll-in-operations goal was achieved and maintained 
</p>
<p>through 2014 with 100 % of waste recycled, despite an 11 % increase in waste pro-
</p>
<p>duction that year. 
</p>
<p> While most companies release their  own   sustainability reports, they also partici-
</p>
<p>pate in a variety of standardized reporting protocols and platforms to assess and 
</p>
<p>communicate their practices. The GRI is the primary reporting initiative through 
</p>
<p>which companies disclose social and environmental practices.

</p>
<p>6.2.2     General Reporting  Platforms   
</p>
<p> In an attempt to provide more structured guidance to CSR reporting, CERES 
</p>
<p>launched the GRI in 1998. In 2001, GRI became a separate organization focusing 
</p>
<p>on corporate social and environmental reporting. As of 2015, the GRI reported that 
</p>
<p>7546 organizations had a profi le in its Sustainability Disclosure Database and that 
</p>
<p>18,744 GRI Reports had been fi led (GRI  2014b ). 
</p>
<p> As a part of its efforts, GRI defi nes metrics and provides guidance for reporting 
</p>
<p>year to year. The GRI recommends a four-step process for defi ning report content 
</p>
<p>(GRI  2013 ) that includes identifi cation, prioritization, validation, and review. The 
</p>
<p>identifi cation process begins by considering the GRI aspect list, stakeholder con-
</p>
<p>cerns, and existing impacts. Following an analysis of these considerations, a com-
</p>
<p>pany prioritizes these concerns by evaluating their individual signifi cance to the 
</p>
<p>organization and their infl uence on stakeholders; defi ne thresholds of materiality to 
</p>
<p>the company; and decide the coverage on the issue. The third step, validation, sets 
</p>
<p>up the systems to collect and measure the information and translates internal data 
</p>
<p>into digestible public disclosures. The fi nal step is a review of the collected material, 
</p>
<p>assessed with previously reported information, and preparation for the next round of 
</p>
<p>reporting. This step-by-step process is detailed extensively in the GRI&rsquo;s &ldquo;G4: 
</p>
<p>Sustainability Reporting Guidelines,&rdquo; to help companies manage the process year to 
</p>
<p>year (GRI  2013 ). However, it is largely up to each company itself to determine and 
</p>
<p>implement strategies to improve its reported scores. 
</p>
<p> Unlike previous versions of the GRI&rsquo;s reporting guidelines, the G4 guidelines 
</p>
<p>include supply chain disclosure as a major component. The boundary of what a 
</p>
<p>company should report on is extended from just a company&rsquo;s individual operations 
</p>
<p>to the full value chain to better understand where impacts occur both upstream and 
</p>
<p>downstream. To visualize these impacts, the G4 guidelines recommend conducting 
</p>
<p>a value-chain assessment to map some of the company&rsquo;s key products and/or ser-
</p>
<p>vices. During the mapping process, the company collects information about impacts 
</p>
<p>at each stage of the supply chain. The data may be derived from the company itself 
</p>
<p>or through the use of proxy data from life cycle management databases. To enable 
</p>
<p>this increase in scope, the GRI initiated the Business Transparency Program that 
</p>
<p>allows suppliers and smaller companies to report under the &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; of a larger 
</p>
<p>organization. The program supports the implementation of reporting within suppli-
</p>
<p>ers to manage risk and improve sustainability performance. 
</p>
<p> GRI facilitates comparison of corporate practices globally. The GRI&rsquo;s reporting 
</p>
<p>framework outlines over 100 environmental, social, economic, and governance top-
</p>
<p>ics on which companies may report (See Table  6.2 ) (GRI  2013 ). Although the 
</p>
<p>framework includes many topics from different focus areas, companies are encour-
</p>
<p>aged to report only on  those   applicable to their business. Because of the  framework&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>broader focus, companies often use their GRI report as a basis for their  sustainability 
</p>
<p>report. For example, Microsoft uses the 2013 GRI Sustainability Reporting 
</p>
<p>Guidelines in the creation of its annual sustainability report (Microsoft  2014 ).

<p>6.2.3        Issue-Specifi c Reporting 
</p>
<p> Environmental disclosures via CSR reports, even when structured by GRI, are gen-
</p>
<p>eral in nature. When environmental topics gain prominence, specifi c guidelines that 
</p>
<p>allow fi rms to perform more detailed reporting and disclosures and allow for bench-
</p>
<p>marking and credible target setting are often developed. These guidelines for report-
</p>
<p>ing are commonly supported by reporting platforms that collect information and 
</p>
<p>report it publicly in a centralized location. Although there are other competing pro-
</p>
<p>tocols and platforms in the environmental reporting space, the following are those 
</p>
<p>that have reached critical mass through the number of corporate users globally. 
</p>
<p>6.2.3.1      Carbon      
</p>
<p> Since the introduction of GHG emissions as a central component of the Kyoto 
</p>
<p>Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, report-
</p>
<p>ing of these emissions has become an increasingly common practice (United 
</p>
<p>Nations  1998 ). 
</p>
<p> The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard is the main accounting tool 
</p>
<p>for businesses to quantify their GHG emissions. Started as a partnership between 
</p>
<p>the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development, the protocol divides emissions into three  scopes   (see Fig.  6.1 ) 
</p>
<p>(Greenhouse Gas  2014 ). Scope 1 includes the emissions that come directly from 
</p>
<p>company-owned operations. The second scope includes indirect emissions from the 
</p>
<p>purchase of electricity, heat, or steam. The third scope includes all other indirect 
</p>
<p>emissions including, but not limited to, activities that are not owned by the com-
</p>
<p>pany&mdash;such as employee travel, waste disposal, outsourced activities, and produc-
</p>
<p>tion of purchased materials, customer impacts, and end-of-life product disposal. In 
</p>
<p>many cases, about 80 % of a business&rsquo; emissions occur in Scope 3 (WRI and 
</p>
<p>WBCSD  2011 ).
</p>
<p>   Most companies are able to report on Scope 1 because they have control over the 
</p>
<p>emissions in question. However, emissions in the Scope 2 and Scope 3 categories 
</p>
<p>are diffi cult for companies to account for, measure, and report because most of the 
</p>
<p>activities are not under their direct control; this is especially true in the case of 
</p>
<p>Scope 3 (Blanco et al.  2014 ). To identify Scope 2 and 3 emissions, companies must 
</p>
<p>rely on upstream suppliers and/or downstream buyers to understand the full life 
</p>
<p>cycle impacts of their practices and goods (Greenhouse Gas  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> To calculate the emissions at each scale, &ldquo;emissions factors&rdquo; (the amount of direct 
</p>
<p>or indirect GHG emissions of a given practice), companies may collect data that is 
</p>
<p>specifi c to their practices. Alternatively, they can use generalized values available 
</p>
<p>from the GHG Protocol to calculate impacts. With the ability to use generalized val-
</p>
<p>ues for emissions amounts for certain practices or processes, a company can assess 
</p>
<p>its Scope 1 emissions simply by collecting basic data from its own operations. For 
</p>
<p>example, a company can collect data on the distance traveled by its trucks and use 
</p>
<p>6 Disclosing and Reporting Environmental Sustainability of Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>132
</p>
<p>this data to calculate emissions impacts using generalized values for vehicle emis-
</p>
<p>sions. The emissions  factors      are based on the best available data sets as determined 
</p>
<p>by the GHG Protocol and are aligned with those used by the  Intergovernmental Panel 
</p>
<p>on Climate Change (IPCC)  , the internationally recognized body on climate change 
</p>
<p>(Greenhouse Gas Protocol  2014 ). However, because practices can vary widely across 
</p>
<p>time and region, the best emissions data is company-specifi c. Chapter   3     by 
</p>
<p>Boukherroub et al. ( 2017 ) provides further background on carbon footprinting. 
</p>
<p>    CDP      
</p>
<p> While the GHG Protocol serves as the reporting protocol, the CDP serves as a wider 
</p>
<p>platform for emissions reporting. The CDP is a UK-based organization established 
</p>
<p>in 2001 that enables large organizations to measure and report GHG. In 2002, the 
</p>
<p>CDP sent out its fi rst survey to engage companies in reporting; it received 221 
</p>
<p>responses from 500 surveyed companies (Winston  2010 ). Twelve years later, in 
</p>
<p>2014, the number of reporting companies had increased to 5003 (CDP  2015a ,  b ,  c ). 
</p>
<p> For its reporting requirements, the CDP utilizes assessment guidelines and scope 
</p>
<p>defi nitions outlined in the GHG Protocol. In recent years, it has expanded to include 
</p>
<p>water, climate risk, and supply-chain wide reporting. The annual questionnaire 
</p>
<p>includes over 100 questions spanning the range of emissions-producing activities. 
</p>
<p>The fi ndings are released every September along with two additional indices: the 
</p>
<p>Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index and the Carbon Performance Leadership

<p>Index, which acknowledge increasing levels of transparency and the greatest GHG 
</p>
<p>reduction over previous years across reporting companies. Such reporting rankings 
</p>
<p>may provide motivation for companies to continue to report and strive to match 
</p>
<p>reductions of their peers. 
</p>
<p> An important feature of the CDP is that it contacts companies to report on 
</p>
<p>behalf of investors. When a company reports to the CDP platform, it provides 
</p>
<p>investors an annual resource of environmental impacts that &ldquo;supports long-term 
</p>
<p>objective analysis&rdquo; (CDP  2015a ). The CDP investor initiatives include 822 institu-
</p>
<p>tional investors with $95 trillion in assets under management (CDP  2015a ). With 
</p>
<p>pressure from investors, companies are encouraged to measure, disclose, and man-
</p>
<p>age their emissions. In this way, investor pressure is playing a role in total emis-
</p>
<p>sion reductions. 
</p>
<p> The CDP has also taken a step further into supply chain disclosure with its sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain program. The program works with buyers and suppliers to collect GHG 
</p>
<p>emissions data information from the suppliers. In Europe and North America, 64 
</p>
<p>companies currently participate in the program, and the CDP supply chain program 
</p>
<p>facilitates reporting from  5600      of their suppliers (CDP  2014b ). The CDP designs 
</p>
<p>and circulates a survey to assess the practices of the suppliers. This survey includes 
</p>
<p>a 17-page questionnaire with 86 questions on issues including climate change risks, 
</p>
<p>management, strategy, and policy. In 2013, of the 5600 suppliers surveyed, 2869 
</p>
<p>responded (CDP  2014b ). This initiative helps to expand the system boundary of 
</p>
<p>environmental reporting from companies to their supply chains. In most cases, how-
</p>
<p>ever, the survey only addresses Tier 1 suppliers, even though global supply chains 
</p>
<p>tend to be at least fi ve or six tiers deep.  
</p>
<p>    EPA SmartWay Program      
</p>
<p> In the case of logistics, the U.S. EPA&rsquo;s SmartWay Program serves as the main report-
</p>
<p>ing platform in the U.S. The SmartWay program was created in 2004 to reduce 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts across the goods movement industry. As a collaborative ini-
</p>
<p>tiative, it brings together shippers, carriers, logistics service providers, and govern-
</p>
<p>mental entities. Shippers range from food companies like Chiquita to retail stores 
</p>
<p>like Whole Foods. The program started with 15 motor carriers but has grown to 
</p>
<p>3000 in 2014, with major carriers such as Ryder and C.H. Robinson reporting to 
</p>
<p>SmartWay (SmartWay  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> SmartWay provides tools to measure and report the impact of logistics carriers 
</p>
<p>over time. Shippers use the assessments to select high-achieving carriers and to 
</p>
<p>gauge progress over time. To measure their impact, carriers collect data from their 
</p>
<p>operations such as miles driven, fuel used, vehicle model year, and cargo payload 
</p>
<p>(EPA  2013 ). Using the SmartWay-provided tools together with their activity spe-
</p>
<p>cifi c data, carriers calculate their environmental performance in grams-per-ton-mile 
</p>
<p>or gram-per-mile emissions. Following the assessment, the carrier&rsquo;s information is 
</p>
<p>publicly reported and ranked within its sector. SmartWay conducts random quality 
</p>
<p>checks on reporting carriers to encourage accuracy in reporting.

</p>
<p> In recent years, shippers began  to      commit to increasing the share of their freight 
</p>
<p>moved by carriers that are SmartWay certifi ed. This emphasis on certifi cation pro-
</p>
<p>vides market incentive for carriers not only to measure and report, but to reduce 
</p>
<p>their environmental impacts relative to their peers. SmartWay also offers tools for 
</p>
<p>benchmarking, vehicle environmental rankings, and guidance on how to replicate a 
</p>
<p>SmartWay-style program internationally (SmartWay  2014 ).   
</p>
<p>6.2.3.2      Water      
</p>
<p> The WFN serves as a framework to calculate an organization&rsquo;s water footprint 
</p>
<p>across the supply chain in the production of its goods and services. The WFN 
</p>
<p>defi nes a water footprint as the &ldquo;volume of freshwater used to produce the product, 
</p>
<p>measured over the full supply chain&rdquo; (Hoekstra et al.  2011 , also Chap.   4     by Hoekstra 
</p>
<p>( 2017 )). A water footprint includes information about volumes of water by source 
</p>
<p>geographically and temporally. It further distinguishes water consumption in terms 
</p>
<p>of blue, green, and grey water, which are defi ned as surface and groundwater, rain-
</p>
<p>water, and polluted water, respectively. As with many assessments, the water foot-
</p>
<p>print is based on a focus area the company selects. For example, an assessment can 
</p>
<p>focus on a specifi c process step within the supply chain or on the total water foot-
</p>
<p>print of a fi nal product; it can also assess the footprint of a specifi c producer or an 
</p>
<p>entire economic sector (Hoekstra et al.  2011 ). 
</p>
<p> In 2010, the Coca Cola Company released a report entitled, &ldquo; Product Water 
</p>
<p>Footprint Assessments  &rdquo; (The Coca Cola Company  2010 ). To inform its sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity water use goals with a comprehensive water footprint analysis, the global bever-
</p>
<p>age company assessed indirect water use in its supply chain by accounting for 
</p>
<p>packaging and ingredients, while also assessing direct operational water use in its 
</p>
<p>bottling plants. The analysis revealed that the water footprint associated with the 
</p>
<p>production of a half-liter of Coca Cola in Dongen, the Netherlands, equated to 12 L 
</p>
<p>of grey water, 15 L of green water, and 8 L of blue water. From this assessment, 
</p>
<p>Coca Cola was able to determine that two-thirds of the water footprint for that par-
</p>
<p>ticular product was related to using blue and green water to grow sugar beets for 
</p>
<p>drink ingredients, while one-third of the footprint was related to grey water effl uents 
</p>
<p>from the supply chain, which included nitrogen in the fertilizer for the beet fi eld and 
</p>
<p>the cooling water for PET production (The Coca Cola Company  2010 ). This indi-
</p>
<p>cated the  company      that a greater focus on sugar beets was important to address 
</p>
<p>impacts on its water footprint. 
</p>
<p> At the time of this writing (2015), most companies were reporting their water 
</p>
<p>footprint individually through their own websites or corporate sustainability reports; 
</p>
<p>for example, Coca-Cola&rsquo;s water footprint is presented on a sub-domain discussing 
</p>
<p>its efforts within its corporate website. Given the absence of a neutral water report-
</p>
<p>ing platform, the CDP, in addition to its role as a carbon reporting platform, initiated 
</p>
<p>a program to serve as a central water impact repository. 
</p>
<p> While the CDP is most known and used for its carbon reporting platform, CDP&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>water program is becoming increasingly utilized by companies and organizations 
</p>

</p>
<p>alike to report their water impacts. Similar to its carbon questionnaire, which assists 
</p>
<p>companies to collect relevant carbon impact information, CDP&rsquo;s water question-
</p>
<p>naire provides guidance for companies to consistently assess, report annually, and 
</p>
<p>act on their water impact (CDP  2015b ). This allows  investors      to include a compa-
</p>
<p>ny&rsquo;s annual water performance in their decision making.   
</p>
<p>6.2.4     Product Level 
</p>
<p> If a company is working to achieve higher levels of environmental sustainability in 
</p>
<p>the production of a product, it may include a label with environmental information 
</p>
<p>to inform its consumers of its activities. These labels are sometimes called  eco- 
</p>
<p>labels     . Eco-labels range widely in the areas they address, rigor of certifi cation, cat-
</p>
<p>egories and issues covered, and region of applicability. These multiple factors 
</p>
<p>increase the challenges for both the company and the consumer. Additional volun-
</p>
<p>tary labels, such as the Rainforest Alliance Certifi cation that identifi es socially and 
</p>
<p>environmentally conscious farming practices, are also used. 
</p>
<p> Other  voluntary labels   offered by environmental organizations require compa-
</p>
<p>nies to provide information about the supply chain in order to receive certifi cation. 
</p>
<p>For example, the  Rainforest Alliance Certifi ed&trade; Seal   indicates that products are 
</p>
<p>made from ingredients sourced from farms using the standards of the Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Agriculture Network (Rainforest Alliance  2014 ). These standards include practices 
</p>
<p>that protect local environments, workers, wildlife, and the communities from which 
</p>
<p>materials are supplied. The seal indicates that the company has traceability to ensure 
</p>
<p>verifi ed practices. 
</p>
<p> Once this information has been vetted by the Rainforest Alliance, the company 
</p>
<p>can place the seal on its products to indicate that the products include ingredients 
</p>
<p>that are made with superior environmental and social practices. Another example is 
</p>
<p>the  Forest Stewardship Council Certifi cation (FSC)  . FSC-certifi ed products are 
</p>
<p>made from materials sourced from forests managed using FSC Principles and 
</p>
<p>Criteria. These criteria include maintaining  high conservation value forests (HCVF)  , 
</p>
<p>conserving resources such as biological diversity and water, and promoting social 
</p>
<p>principles such as the protection of indigenous people&rsquo;s rights (FSC  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> There are also government-mandated labels, such as the US EPA&rsquo;s vehicle MPG 
</p>
<p>(miles per gallon)       label that indicates fuel effi ciency. A newly updated label released 
</p>
<p>by the US EPA in 2011 requires that information to inform consumers about smog 
</p>
<p>and greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions on a 1&ndash;10 scale appears on the label (US 
</p>
<p>DOE  2011 ). In addition to environmental impact ratings, this label also provides an 
</p>
<p>MPG rating for city and highway driving and estimates the fuel cost savings for cars 
</p>
<p>with better MPG than the average-performing car. The objectives of this label are to 
</p>
<p>increase consumer awareness and preference for cars with better environmental per-
</p>
<p>formance and encourage the car market to support this demand. 
</p>
<p> When deciding whether or not to pursue any type of labeling, a company must 
</p>
<p>fi rst decide whether it is worth the time, effort, and expense of obtaining some form 
</p>
<p>6 Disclosing and Reporting Environmental Sustainability of Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>136
</p>
<p>of label. This question may arise because some consumers may have no knowledge 
</p>
<p>of or interest in the label&rsquo;s disclosures. For example, a 2010 study by Delmas and 
</p>
<p>Grant showed that wine producers featuring the  USDA Organic label   on their bot-
</p>
<p>tles actually had to reduce their selling prices to get consumers to buy their products 
</p>
<p>(Delmas and Grant  2010 ). This may be due to a perception that organic wines are of 
</p>
<p>lower quality. However, in other cases, the high recognition and regard for a label 
</p>
<p>by local consumers may allow a company to gain a price premium for its products. 
</p>
<p>For example, Bj&oslash;rner et al. ( 2004 ) found that consumers in Denmark were willing 
</p>
<p>to pay 10&ndash;17 % more for toilet paper labeled with the Nordic Swan certifi cation, a 
</p>
<p>local multi-criteria environmental label. This demonstrates that a company must 
</p>
<p>think strategically about potential price and reputation benefi ts, if any, prior to 
</p>
<p>obtaining a label. 
</p>
<p> A majority of labels represent sustainability at only one phase or dimension of 
</p>
<p>the supply chain. For example, the MPG label only accounts for the environmental 
</p>
<p>impact at the consumer use phase of driving the automobile but indicates nothing 
</p>
<p>about the impact of the manufacturing processes or vehicle  recycling  . The USDA 
</p>
<p>organic label informs the consumer that produce has been farmed organically but 
</p>
<p>gives no information about the transportation impacts from farm to store or whether 
</p>
<p>virgin forest was destroyed to make the farm. Some labels seek to inform the con-
</p>
<p>sumer about the full life cycle carbon, water use, or waste impacts of a product 
</p>
<p>across the supply chain, from materials to manufacturing to transportation. The 
</p>
<p>Carbon Trust is one organization offering a label of this type, called the  Carbon 
</p>
<p>Footprint Label      (Carbon Trust  2015 ). The Carbon Footprint Label displays the total 
</p>
<p>carbon impact of a product over its entire life cycle. The Carbon Trust also offers 
</p>
<p>certifi cation that discloses total water usage, management, and effl uent, as well as 
</p>
<p>waste management and disposal. A company can inform consumers about the total 
</p>
<p>impact of a product, such as grams of CO 2  produced, with a measurement label. 
</p>
<p>The company can also communicate to consumers that it has reduced the overall 
</p>
<p>footprint of that product with a reduction label. To attain this level of disclosure, a 
</p>
<p>company must assess the impact of its products through life cycle assessment. 
</p>
<p>6.2.4.1     Life Cycle  Assessment      
</p>
<p> For companies that want to take disclosure a step further, a Life Cycle Assessment 
</p>
<p>(LCA) offers deep insight into the environmental impacts of a company&rsquo;s products. 
</p>
<p>(See Chap.   2     by Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 ) for a comprehensive introduction to 
</p>
<p>LCA.) This rigorous assessment tool accounts not only for the company&rsquo;s environ-
</p>
<p>mental impacts but also for those of its upstream suppliers and downstream buyers 
</p>
<p>to provide the fullest depth of detail possible. LCAs became widely used in the 
</p>
<p>1970s and 1980s, during a period of growing environmental awareness and an 
</p>
<p>energy crisis. However, when manufacturers began to calculate LCAs for their 
</p>
<p>products, they often used varying methodologies that had not been scrutinized or 
</p>
<p>validated, and assessments were often manipulated to support a preferred outcome. 
</p>
<p>To overcome this, the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO)   
</p>
<p>A.H. Bateman et al.</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-29791-0_2">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-29791-0_2</a></div>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>137
</p>
<p>introduced a standardized LCA methodology in 1997 (ISO  2006 ). The LCA meth-
</p>
<p>odology includes four steps that are designed to account for a product&rsquo;s total envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental impact. 
</p>
<p> The LCA&rsquo;s four steps include: goal and scope defi nition; inventory analysis; impact 
</p>
<p>assessment; and interpretation. The Goal and Scope Defi nition element informs a com-
</p>
<p>pany about the system boundary of its product. Inventory Analysis facilitates the col-
</p>
<p>lection of data for all inputs and outputs of a fi nal product and its end of life. Impact 
</p>
<p>Assessment uses the collected data to calculate the specifi ed inputs and outputs, and 
</p>
<p>Interpretation provides a discussion of the analysis results, highlighting limitations and 
</p>
<p>recommendations as related to the original goal of the study (ISO  2006 ). 
</p>
<p> If a company wants faster results, software systems such as SimaPro (Pre 
</p>
<p>Sustainability  2014 ) and GaBi ( 2014 ), which use databases that draw from general-
</p>
<p>izable data sets for specifi c activities such as Ecoinvent ( 2014 ), are often used to 
</p>
<p>conduct an LCA. An LCA provides insight into the greatest sources of impact along 
</p>
<p>the supply chain. However, the practice incorporates some sensitivity fl aws when 
</p>
<p>generalized data sets or incorrect assumptions are used. 
</p>
<p> Although the Life Cycle Assessment offers a more complete picture of a com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s impacts across its supply chain, the fi ndings go largely unreported. Many 
</p>
<p>companies use the tool primarily to obtain information about which areas in their 
</p>
<p>supply chain offer the greatest opportunities to reduce environmental impact. 
</p>
<p>Companies also may not report  their      results because they believe that the complex 
</p>
<p>nature of the information would not be generally understood by the public.    
</p>
<p>6.3     Environmental Reporting Strategy 
</p>
<p> The practice of reporting helps a business understand its impact and seek appropri-
</p>
<p>ate action to minimize this impact. To effectively manage impact reduction over 
</p>
<p>time, companies must set up a regular reporting cycle, which includes collection of 
</p>
<p>data, communication of results, and external feedback (GRI  2014a ,  b ). If reporting 
</p>
<p>is regular, then environmental actions are more closely monitored and evaluated, 
</p>
<p>which can make them more successful. In addition, this process keeps all stakehold-
</p>
<p>ers, both internal and external, informed. Internal alignment with reporting can 
</p>
<p>engage company executives to help align sustainability with company strategy. 
</p>
<p>6.3.1     Decision to Report 
</p>
<p> In many cases, companies are leading the way by reporting without the pressure of 
</p>
<p>regulation. They report to contend with competitors or to satisfy stakeholder pres-
</p>
<p>sures. Although companies are proactively disclosing, internal practices are not 
</p>
<p>always aligned to support robust sustainability reporting. Much data collection con-
</p>
<p>tinues to be ad hoc, with a few individuals gathering necessary information from

<p>around the company through emails and Excel spreadsheets. Some software solu-
</p>
<p>tions are emerging through organizations like Enviance ( 2015 ) and  Systems, 
</p>
<p>Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP)  .  SAP   is a German multina-
</p>
<p>tional software corporation that developed the Product Stewardship Network ( 2015 ) 
</p>
<p>to assist corporations with their reporting. Intelex and the EHS Regulatory 
</p>
<p>Documentation OnDemand offer similar software solutions ( 2015 ). These tools 
</p>
<p>allow a company to track environmental data across the company or products; some 
</p>
<p>also manage regulatory limits as applicable to the company. Although helpful, these 
</p>
<p>software solutions have limitations in terms of supply chain scope, training require-
</p>
<p>ments, compatibility with enterprise systems, and cost. The variability in data col-
</p>
<p>lection also infl uences the content of reports. 
</p>
<p> In addition, the scale of reporting does not always indicate quality or accuracy. 
</p>
<p>For example, research commissioned by the European Union indicated that, 
</p>
<p>although companies operating in Europe are releasing environmental reports, the 
</p>
<p>information may be lacking in substance (Wensen et al.  2011 ). The information 
</p>
<p>provided is incomplete and selective, designed only to show positive company prac-
</p>
<p>tices, and the information provided may be skewed. The report goes on to say that 
</p>
<p>regulation of sustainability reports may improve the content and accuracy of the 
</p>
<p>reports and standardize reporting across companies (Wensen et al.  2011 ). In addi-
</p>
<p>tion to the challenges of  selective representation and accuracy  , reports tend to have 
</p>
<p>a limited focus. As previously noted, because a company only has direct control 
</p>
<p>over and visibility into its own operations and little leverage to account for and man-
</p>
<p>age upstream suppliers and downstream buyers, supply chain impacts are largely 
</p>
<p>absent from the reports. 
</p>
<p> Companies are increasingly interested in understanding the impacts of their sup-
</p>
<p>ply chains, either voluntarily or because they are required to evaluate them by pres-
</p>
<p>sure or mandate. However, the practice of supply chain assessment beyond a 
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s direct operations brings numerous additional challenges. In many cases, 
</p>
<p>in order to obtain the information required to account for the full impact of the sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain, companies send out questionnaires, surveys, or scorecards to their suppli-
</p>
<p>ers. These documents ask the suppliers to report their environmental impacts and to 
</p>
<p>allow the requesting company to gauge their full impact. This initiates what is 
</p>
<p>sometimes referred to as the &ldquo; survey waterfall  &rdquo;   : when the initiating company 
</p>
<p>requests information about a supplier&rsquo;s practices, it must also survey the supplier&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>suppliers, and so on. Often, suppliers may lack the knowledge or tools to conduct 
</p>
<p>such an assessment. In some cases, the requesting company will support its suppli-
</p>
<p>ers in learning how to audit their practices. For example, when Siemens&rsquo; started to 
</p>
<p>assess its suppliers and their energy use in an attempt to reduce its total carbon 
</p>
<p>footprint, it provided both training and a methodology for suppliers (Siemens  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> In other cases, specifi c industries have developed a standard questionnaire. For 
</p>
<p>example, the electronics sector offers the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition 
</p>
<p>Self-Assessment Questionnaire (EICC  2014 ). The pharmaceutical industry devel-
</p>
<p>oped the  Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative Self-Assessment Questionnaire   
</p>
<p>(Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative  2013 ). These industry initiatives are ben-
</p>

</p>
<p>efi cial because they reduce the burden on suppliers to respond to differing requests 
</p>
<p>for information from various buyers; they also provide a clear standard and guid-
</p>
<p>ance for reporting and offer tools to address environmental challenges.  
</p>
<p>6.3.2     The Role of Third Parties in  Reporting   
</p>
<p> In cases where there is no industry standard, or where a company has limited capac-
</p>
<p>ity to contact its supply chain partners, a third party may be engaged to conduct 
</p>
<p>environmental data collection. Designed initially around risk management issues, 
</p>
<p>organizations like EcoVadis now additionally focus on environmental reporting. 
</p>
<p>EcoVadis&rsquo; primary role is to collect information from suppliers on behalf of its cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. To do this, it sends a questionnaire to suppliers that includes questions on 
</p>
<p>topics ranging from child labor to carbon emissions, as requested by the customer. 
</p>
<p> EcoVadis   then manages the entire information-gathering process&mdash;from crafting 
</p>
<p>the questions to following up on non-responsive suppliers to obtain data a company 
</p>
<p>needs to assess its supply chain impacts (EcoVadis  2014 ). It also asks for documen-
</p>
<p>tation from suppliers to support answers and data provided. 
</p>
<p> EcoVadis and other such companies serve as intermediaries between companies 
</p>
<p>needing to collect relevant data and their suppliers through reporting platforms. 
</p>
<p>Platforms of this type can be benefi cial to both buyers and suppliers. Buyers have an 
</p>
<p>organization collecting the necessary data for them, and suppliers have a repository 
</p>
<p>for their information from which to draw for other requesting buyers. In addition, if 
</p>
<p>they so choose, suppliers can make information about their environmental practices 
</p>
<p>public so other buyers may source from them if their practices are better than those 
</p>
<p>of their peers. However, when engaging a middleman like EcoVadis, suppliers are 
</p>
<p>assessed a fee to use these services and maintain their relationship with their buyer.   
</p>
<p>6.4     Future of Reporting 
</p>
<p> Although many driving factors have led to increased environmental reporting from 
</p>
<p>companies internationally, the business impact of disclosure is still unclear. The 
</p>
<p>motivations that  drive reporting   are often regulatory compliance, risk mitigation, 
</p>
<p>and brand positioning. However, if reporting can be linked to increasing corporate 
</p>
<p>value, the case for more widely spread and higher quality reporting can be made. 
</p>
<p>Existing challenges that continue to prevent greater adoption of reporting include 
</p>
<p>the time, cost, and limited benefi ts associated with reporting (Wensen et al.  2011 ). 
</p>
<p>Further identifi cation of clear boundaries, areas of focus, quality, and value to the 
</p>
<p>company will increase motivation to report for companies of all sizes and across 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions.

</p>
<p>6.4.1     Future Trends 
</p>
<p> Several trends can be seen in the future of reporting. The fi rst is the consolidation and 
</p>
<p>standardization of various  disclosure paradigms and reporting schemes   used by com-
</p>
<p>panies. Currently, companies face multiple mandatory and voluntary standards, and 
</p>
<p>additional (often different) organizations exist to which companies report. Not only 
</p>
<p>are standards sometimes unconnected to reporting mechanisms, but they also address 
</p>
<p>different issues (carbon, water, deforestation, social). Furthermore, they may have dif-
</p>
<p>ferent geographical scopes, such as state (California), national (United States), regional 
</p>
<p>(European Union), or global. This multiplicity impedes high- quality reporting prac-
</p>
<p>tices at companies, and it also confuses external readers of the reports: the different 
</p>
<p>forms of reporting can overwhelm even the most conscientious environmentalist. 
</p>
<p> The next major trend is the shift from company-wide to supply chain-wide 
</p>
<p>reporting. As previously discussed, upstream and downstream impacts are not cur-
</p>
<p>rently included in most reports. Preliminary assessments are conducted on a limited 
</p>
<p>and private scale; this includes the increasingly common practice of  LCA   to assess 
</p>
<p>the full impact of a product. At this time, the disclosure of LCA fi ndings is not com-
</p>
<p>mon. Reporting institutions such as CDP are beginning to address the supply chain 
</p>
<p>issue through supplier questionnaires and other programs (Jira and Toffel  2013 ), but 
</p>
<p>these only address fi rst-tier suppliers. Although this practice may be limited, the 
</p>
<p>fi ndings are promising. A report commissioned by  CDP   found that suppliers who 
</p>
<p>had several buyers requesting information were more likely to report (CDP  2014b ). 
</p>
<p>The next major challenge will be for companies and reporting institutions to engage 
</p>
<p>the deeper tiers to increase supply chain transparency. 
</p>
<p> An additional reporting trend can be observed in new platforms for reporting, 
</p>
<p>such as social media and e-commerce. Digital communications in the form of social 
</p>
<p>media have become the modern venue for information sharing. The platforms can 
</p>
<p>serve to inform other businesses, the investing community, stakeholder groups, and 
</p>
<p>customers. This trend can be seen in fi nancial reporting, and it was addressed by the 
</p>
<p> Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)      in 2013 through guidance for public 
</p>
<p>companies on the use of social media. The SEC&rsquo;s intent was to align companies 
</p>
<p>with obligations under the federal securities laws (U.S. Securities and Exchange 
</p>
<p>Commission  2013 ). As companies fi nd it more relevant to disclose fi nancial events 
</p>
<p>through social media, environmental disclosure may also follow this route. 
</p>
<p> In addition to disclosures through social media, e-commerce platforms such as 
</p>
<p> online shopping and B2B marketplaces   may be a new channel for environmental 
</p>
<p>disclosures. As online marketplaces have proliferated and become mainstream with 
</p>
<p>websites like Amazon, so has the engagement of the consumer with web-based 
</p>
<p>information presented via those marketplaces. Consumer reviews and ingredient 
</p>
<p>disclosures represent two forms of this type of data. To further inform consumers, 
</p>
<p>companies may use  e-commerce platforms   as an additional opportunity to present 
</p>
<p>environmental disclosures. For example, eBay Inc. created a supplemental website 
</p>
<p>specifi cally to offer products with positive environmental attributes under green.
</p>
<p>eBay.com (eBay  2015 ). These products have better environmental attributes and 
</p>
<p>A.H. Bateman et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>141
</p>
<p>more environmental disclosures than do their counterparts. This trend is likely to 
</p>
<p>continue across other products. 
</p>
<p> The fi nal major trend involves transitioning from merely reporting environmental 
</p>
<p>impacts to also managing them. In many cases, companies are seeing reporting as a 
</p>
<p>box to be checked. If they have reported their impacts and seen no major external 
</p>
<p>feedback, their environmental engagement ends. If reporting is treated as a manage-
</p>
<p>ment tool, however, a business might be better equipped to identify key issues and 
</p>
<p>to set appropriate goals backed by  solid metrics   (MacLean and Rebernak  2007 ). If 
</p>
<p>reporting were linked with clear metrics to assess how company activities are creat-
</p>
<p>ing environmental impacts, the rationale behind reporting could be strengthened.

<p>7.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>Logistics encompasses the business processes that plan, control, and implement the 
</p>
<p>flow of goods and related information between points of origin and points of con-
</p>
<p>sumption to meet customer demand. It does so by managing transportation, ware-
</p>
<p>housing, and inventory decisions across the company and, whenever possible, 
</p>
<p>across its supply chain.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, logistics decisions have been driven by minimizing cost, maximiz-
</p>
<p>ing profitability, or achieving customer service targets. As companies have added 
</p>
<p>sustainability goals to their business objectives, there has been an increased interest 
</p>
<p>in mitigating the social and environmental impact of their products and operations. 
</p>
<p>This new focus has also impacted the field of logistics: transportation providers are 
</p>
<p>expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their vehicles, warehouse man-
</p>
<p>agers have focused on waste and energy reduction strategies, and products are rede-
</p>
<p>signed to increase recyclability and reuse, which require different inventory planning 
</p>
<p>needs.
</p>
<p>Green Logistics refers to the systematic measurement, analysis, and, ultimately, 
</p>
<p>mitigation of the environmental impact of logistics activities. This effort to mitigate 
</p>
<p>environmental externalities in logistics activities includes reducing of consumption 
</p>
<p>of nonrenewable energy sources, air emissions (e.g., particulate matter), greenhouse 
</p>
<p>gas emissions, and waste. Some of these efforts may be technological, such as

<p>replacing vehicle fleets from diesel to hybrid or replacing cardboard boxes with 
</p>
<p>returnable totes. Other strategies involve better ways to plan and execute the move-
</p>
<p>ment of goods, such as increasing the utilization of trucks while maintaining inven-
</p>
<p>tory levels under control; or using modes of transportation that have lower 
</p>
<p>greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, some green logistics initiatives may be in sup-
</p>
<p>port of larger business environmental goals, such as increasing reverse logistics 
</p>
<p>activities to recover and reuse more of the products delivered to customers.
</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA 2009) estimates that transport as a whole 
</p>
<p>accounts for 19 % of global energy use and 23 % of energy-related carbon dioxide 
</p>
<p>(CO2) emission. Under current policies and technology trends, these emissions are 
</p>
<p>expected to grow 50 % by 2030 and between 80 and 130 % by 2050 from 2007 lev-
</p>
<p>els. Within the transportation sector, freight, especially trucking, is expected to 
</p>
<p>experience the fastest growth. In the USA, medium and heavy-duty freight trucks 
</p>
<p>account for more than 60 % of the freight transportation emissions and are growing 
</p>
<p>faster than any other mode (Greene and Plotkin 2001). Figure 7.1 provides an over-
</p>
<p>all estimate of CO2 emissions from freight transport and logistics activities. 
</p>
<p>Transport is responsible for about 90 % of these emissions. The main focus of this 
</p>
<p>chapter on green logistics consequently relates to freight transportation.
</p>
<p>This chapter is organized as follows. Section 7.2 describes the main environmen-
</p>
<p>tal impacts of logistic operations, namely greenhouse gases, pollution, noise, vibra-
</p>
<p>tion, and packaging waste. Details on how these impacts could be estimated and

<p>their relative importance is discussed. Section 7.3 focuses on the importance and 
</p>
<p>subtleties of measuring green logistics. Section 7.4 introduces the various green 
</p>
<p>logistics strategies available to mitigate these impacts. These strategies are pre-
</p>
<p>sented within a framework of decision-making, including a discussion on how to 
</p>
<p>leverage two important modeling approaches to achieve green logistics: network 
</p>
<p>design and vehicle routing. Using real-life success stories, Sect. 7.5 discusses how 
</p>
<p>organizations collaborate to implement green logistics in practice. We conclude 
</p>
<p>with a discussion on other strategies and relevant aspects of a sound green logistics 
</p>
<p>strategy.
</p>
<p>7.2  The Environmental Impact of Logistics
</p>
<p>As goods flow from origins to destinations through the logistics network, they are 
</p>
<p>moved in conveyances (e.g., planes, trucks, ships, motorcycles) powered by fossil 
</p>
<p>fuels (e.g., diesel, petrol). During the engine combustion process, visible and invis-
</p>
<p>ible gasses are emitted through exhaust pipes that impact the local, regional, and 
</p>
<p>global atmospheric composition, ranging from local air, water, or soil pollution to 
</p>
<p>global climate change. Energy used during storage and handling of goods also 
</p>
<p>impacts the atmosphere, albeit not always directly, but indirectly through nonrenew-
</p>
<p>able energy use. The transport conveyances also generate noise and vibration as 
</p>
<p>they navigate roads, highways, and waterways, thereby affecting human and wild-
</p>
<p>life quality of life. Finally, additional packaging and materials is used to preserve 
</p>
<p>the integrity of products before they reach customers. Inadequate disposal or excess 
</p>
<p>waste of this additional protective packaging is another potential environmental 
</p>
<p>impact of logistics.
</p>
<p>In this section we will describe the four main environmental impacts of transpor-
</p>
<p>tation operations in logistics: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that affect global 
</p>
<p>climate, pollution of air quality and water ways, noise and vibration that affect 
</p>
<p>human health, and packaging waste that increases pressure on landfills.
</p>
<p>7.2.1  GHG Emissions
</p>
<p>Greenhouse gases trap heat, making the planet warmer. The Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identifies transportation activities as producing 
</p>
<p>three direct greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous 
</p>
<p>oxide (N2O). The combustion of transport fuels produces relatively little carbon in 
</p>
<p>non-CO2 gases. The impact of each of these greenhouse gases is expressed in terms 
</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), a process commonly referred to as carbon 
</p>
<p>footprinting. (For more on carbon footprinting, see also Chap. 3 by Boukherroub 
</p>
<p>et al. (2017)).

</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, more than 90 % of the GHG emissions in logistics are due 
</p>
<p>to freight transportation. For each mode of transportation in a logistics network 
</p>
<p>(road, railways, water-borne navigation, aviation) the IPCC recommends a fuel- 
</p>
<p>based approach to measuring emissions due to the fairly consistent estimates of the 
</p>
<p>amount of greenhouse gases produced by combustion of each type of fuel. This 
</p>
<p>approach is also known as energy-based calculation, and it is the most reliable for 
</p>
<p>CO2, the primary greenhouse gas from transportation, representing an estimated 
</p>
<p>97 % of GHG emissions from road (IPCC 2006) and 98 % from marine transporta-
</p>
<p>tion (IMO 2009).
</p>
<p>If total fuel consumption is known, CO2 emissions can be computed as described 
</p>
<p>in Eq. 7.1 by multiplying the total fuel used by the conveyance multiplied by the 
</p>
<p>emissions factor for that fuel.
</p>
<p> (7.1)
</p>
<p>CH4 and N2O are best estimated using distance traveled plus emissions produced 
</p>
<p>during cold start of the conveyance. It necessitates a more detailed breakdown of the 
</p>
<p>data, requiring distance traveled and emissions factors by fuel type, vehicle type, 
</p>
<p>emission control technology, and operating conditions such as road types. This is 
</p>
<p>shown in Eq. 7.2.

</p>
<p>calculation, from the pump-to-wheel or well-to-wheel/life-cycle (see Sect. 7.3.2 for 
</p>
<p>a discussion on emission scopes).
</p>
<p>7.2.1.1  Activity-Based Calculations
</p>
<p>Equations 7.1 and 7.2 from the IPCC guidelines assume total fuel consumption 
</p>
<p>numbers are readily available or easy to estimate. Although this may be the case at 
</p>
<p>the national or regional level (e.g., total oil imports, total petrol sales) or to convey-
</p>
<p>ance owners that keep track of fuel purchases, this data is often not accessible to 
</p>
<p>third-party logistics providers, manufacturers or retailers who make logistics deci-
</p>
<p>sions. Moreover, logistics decisions are not made at the conveyance level (e.g., 
</p>
<p>truck, vessel, locomotive) but rather at the shipment level (e.g., box, carton, pallet) 
</p>
<p>or at another planning metric (e.g., kilogram, cubic feet, or tonne).
</p>
<p>Activity-based methods work by estimating the fuel consumed during transpor-
</p>
<p>tation based on vehicle characteristics, or combining fuel consumption data with 
</p>
<p>activity data to calculate average efficiency numbers. Like fuel-based methods, 
</p>
<p>these methods will be sensitive to the choice of fuel emissions factors.
</p>
<p>Distance Based
</p>
<p>The simplest approach to estimating emissions from activity data is to use the dis-
</p>
<p>tance traveled multiplied by the average fuel consumption of the vehicle or convey-
</p>
<p>ance. Together, these produce an estimate of the fuel consumed, which can then be 
</p>
<p>used to estimate GHG emissions by choosing an appropriate factor, as discussed in 
</p>
<p>the fuel-based methods. A number of different approaches are used in practice to 
</p>
<p>estimate vehicle-distance emissions factors, generally varying in the level of preci-
</p>
<p>sion they provide.
</p>
<p>The GHG Protocol provides default emissions factors per mile for a number of 
</p>
<p>vehicle types, using both US and UK numbers. The emissions factors for US vehi-
</p>
<p>cles are based on assumed average vehicle efficiency for a variety of vehicle types 
</p>

</p>
<p>(Heavy Duty, Light Duty, Passenger Cars, Motorbikes, etc.) to determine fuel 
</p>
<p>consumption, and the standard factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O from the US 
</p>
<p>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discussed in the fuel-based section. 
</p>
<p>Numbers in the UK are based on surveys of fuel consumption in vehicle fleets. The 
</p>
<p>fuel consumption data is combined with the UK Department for Environment, Food 
</p>
<p>&amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) standard CO2 factor to produce an emission factor consider-
</p>
<p>ing only CO2 on a per-kilometer basis.
</p>
<p>Other sources have focused more on a single mode type to provide more precise 
</p>
<p>levels of emissions factors. The EPA&rsquo;s SmartWay program (see Sect. 7.5.4) collects 
</p>
<p>data from a number of different carriers. It employs a fuel-based methodology to 
</p>
<p>calculate emissions from the carriers, and combines this with activity data supplied 
</p>
<p>by the carriers to calculate distance-based emission factors at the individual carrier 
</p>
<p>level. This is then used to create a hierarchy of emissions factors, from which a user 
</p>
<p>can select emission factors for a mode (truck, rail, multi-modal, logistics), a cate-
</p>
<p>gory within the mode (such as package, truckload/dry van, refrigerated, and others 
</p>
<p>within the truck category), and finally a specific carrier within that category. A 
</p>
<p> single company may have a number of different emissions factors, one for each 
</p>
<p>category of business for which it reported data.
</p>
<p>The Network for Transport and Environment (NTM) program does not collect 
</p>
<p>specific data from carriers, but rather uses the ARTEMIS simulation tool to calcu-
</p>
<p>late fuel consumption for a number of different scenarios (NTM 2010). These sce-
</p>
<p>narios account for different sizes of vehicles, percent loaded, road type, and driving 
</p>
<p>conditions. By using these scenarios and an associated fuel-based emissions factor, 
</p>
<p>a range of emissions factors can be calculated. In each case, the emissions are cal-
</p>
<p>culated using a straightforward multiplication of the distance and the vehicle- 
</p>
<p>specific emissions factor.
</p>
<p>Table 7.2 shows a summary of the results of using a number of different types of 
</p>
<p>factors to calculate the emissions from a 1000-mile trip.
</p>
<p>Despite little variation between emissions factors for diesel fuel, the emissions 
</p>
<p>estimated for a specific trip using activity-based distance methods can vary consid-
</p>
<p>erably. This is true even for vehicles in the same class, as the NTM factors shown 
</p>
<p>for a truck + semi-trailer range from 1.6 to 2.3 depending on the load factor and road 
</p>
<p>type. The EPA SmartWay factors illustrate the correlation of emissions by specific 
</p>
<p>carrier and type of freight.
</p>
<p>This demonstrates important points about the precision of the emissions factors 
</p>
<p>used. Estimations of fuel consumed can vary considerably, and therefore even if 
</p>
<p>consistent fuel-based factors are used, the results obtained from activity-based data 
</p>
<p>are sensitive to the assumptions regarding vehicle operating conditions (e.g., terrain, 
</p>
<p>amount of cargo, driver proficiency).
</p>
<p>Weight-Distance Based
</p>
<p>Despite the ease of using vehicle-distance factors and the availability of a wide 
</p>
<p>range of emissions factors, it is still inadequate for logistics analysis when using 
</p>
<p>shared modes of transportation or when only the bare minimum of information is 
</p>
<p>E.E. Blanco and Y. Sheffi</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>153
</p>
<p>known about the shipment. In the first case, the emissions of the vehicle as a whole 
</p>
<p>are not of concern, rather the share of emissions related to a specific amount of 
</p>
<p>goods shipped. In the second case, the logistics decision maker may not know the 
</p>
<p>specific vehicle, the loading factors, or the exact route used.
</p>
<p>In these situations, weight-distance methods are generally used, though in some 
</p>
<p>cases a volume-distance method may be more appropriate. Emissions factors for 
</p>
<p>weight-distance methods are generally expressed in terms of ton-miles of goods 
</p>
<p>moved (or perhaps TEU-miles for ocean containers where volume may be more 
</p>
<p>important than weight). These methods provide a quick and easy method of calcu-
</p>
<p>lating emissions, relying only on the weight of the goods shipped, the distance, and 
</p>
<p>a general knowledge of the mode of transport used. They are also useful in compar-
</p>
<p>ing between modes, when efficiency is measured not just in the amount of emissions 
</p>
<p>produced but the total amount of goods moved.
</p>
<p>The GHG Protocol provides emissions factors in terms of ton-miles for a variety 
</p>
<p>of transportation modes, using factors derived from both the EPA and Defra. These 
</p>
<p>factors introduce another layer of assumptions beyond those of fuel-based and 
</p>
<p>vehicle- distance-based methods, as now the factors must include assumptions 
</p>
<p>regarding the total amount of goods on the vehicle. This can lead to a wide range of 
</p>
<p>emissions factors, depending on the assumptions used. This is illustrated in 
</p>
<p>Table 7.3, where emissions factors for different modes and types of transportation 
</p>
<p>are compared for a shipment consisting of 10,000 short ton-miles (equivalent to a 
</p>
<p>10-t shipment being moved 1000 miles).

<p>Table 7.3 also shows the wide variation not just between modes, in which ocean 
</p>
<p>shipping may be as much as 200 times more efficient than air transport, but also 
</p>
<p>between sources. The EPA&rsquo;s numbers, for instance, are based on high-level data and 
</p>
<p>do not distinguish between types of transport within a mode. Thus, there is no dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between heavy-duty trucks or light-duty vehicles within road transport, or 
</p>
<p>between large container ships and small tankers in watercraft. This is in contrast to 
</p>
<p>the Defra numbers that are generated at a greater level of precision and show the 
</p>
<p>range of values that can exist between different types of transport.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that some organizations, such as NTM or EcoTransIT, 
</p>
<p>provide calculators with the ability to adjust some of the assumptions behind 
</p>
<p>weight-distance-based emission factors, such as vehicle loading factors, to provide 
</p>
<p>more realistic estimates. This fine-tuning requires more data, which is not always

</p>
<p>similar data by carrier, providing another layer of detail to emission factors. Finally, 
</p>
<p>some logistics operators and transportation companies, such as DHL, FedEx, or 
</p>
<p>Maersk, use their internal proprietary systems and their transportation network 
</p>
<p>information (e.g., total weight or cube moved on a particular transportation lane 
</p>
<p>during a year) and combine it with fuel consumption records of the vehicles or ves-
</p>
<p>sels, to provide lane-specific distance-weight emission factors, and in some cases, 
</p>
<p>shipper-specific factors for dedicated customers. These factors are often updated 
</p>
<p>annually, although there is a trend toward more frequent reporting. Even these orga-
</p>
<p>nizations rely on emission factors like the ones listed in Table 7.3, because their 
</p>
<p>shipments may move between trucks, ships, or airplanes for which fuel records are 
</p>
<p>not available or that belong to third parties with less detailed information.
</p>
<p>7.2.1.2  Mode-Specific Adjustments
</p>
<p>All of the GHG calculation approaches and methods discussed above are applicable 
</p>
<p>to all modes of transportation (road, rail, water-borne, and air). Most salient differ-
</p>
<p>ences, besides variations in engine technology and type of fuels, are related to the 
</p>
<p>GHG gases included, the quality of data, the allocation of emissions to freight due 
</p>
<p>to capacity sharing (e.g., same vehicle moving people and boxes), and strategies to 
</p>
<p>overcome data limitations.
</p>
<p>Rail
</p>
<p>The most important variation in rail has to do with the variability of the number of 
</p>
<p>railcars (empty and full) being pulled by a single locomotive. In theory the amount 
</p>
<p>of fuel consumed during any journey or leg can be tracked and allocated to the cargo 
</p>
<p>being hauled on that specific leg, thereby creating movement-specific factors. In 
</p>
<p>practice, however, rail operators plan their movements and balance on a network 
</p>
<p>perspective. Thus, it only makes sense to look at emissions from a series of inter-
</p>
<p>connected networks or services and to measure the total amount of fuel and cargo 
</p>
<p>moved through that rail network, as opposed to individual legs. These calculations 
</p>
<p>are often done annually but could also be done on a monthly or quarterly basis, 
</p>
<p>aligned with rail operator planning cycles.
</p>
<p>Water-Borne Navigation
</p>
<p>Some water-borne navigation providers, such as barges, operate in a similar fashion 
</p>
<p>as long-haul vehicles, albeit through a smaller transportation network: rivers and 
</p>
<p>canals. For these providers, trip-based estimations are sensible: measuring the total 
</p>
<p>fuel consumed between origin and destination and allocating the emissions to the 
</p>
<p>amount of cargo loaded. Because adjustments for empty journeys need to be added 
</p>
<p>and assigned to various trips, emission factors that span more than one journey over 
</p>
<p>a time horizon are often needed.
</p>

</p>
<p>For large ocean-going cargo ships, the situation is very different. Unlike river 
</p>
<p>waterways, ocean shipping companies plan their transportation networks by trade 
</p>
<p>lanes between continents and sub-continents, stringing together multiple trade lanes 
</p>
<p>to provide regular service to various ports. Thus, similar to rail transportation, even 
</p>
<p>though is mathematically possible, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to compute GHG emis-
</p>
<p>sions by looking at port-to-port distances without full understanding of the overall 
</p>
<p>trade-lane dynamics. In addition, given the size of the vessels and the relatively few 
</p>
<p>number of carriers (compared to road transport) the industry has been developing 
</p>
<p>joint efforts to calculate emission factors by trade-lane in a homogeneous way. The 
</p>
<p>Clean Cargo Working Group has been collecting data in collaboration with major 
</p>
<p>shipping companies to provide a homogeneous calculation approach of emissions 
</p>
<p>by trade-lane and ship assignment, if possible.
</p>
<p>An additional feature of some water-borne navigation has to do with the relevant 
</p>
<p>unit of measures used by shipping companies to determine the amount of freight 
</p>
<p>being transported: the container. After the invention and wide adoption of the con-
</p>
<p>tainer, water-borne navigation was transformed to leverage the economic and effi-
</p>
<p>ciency advantages of the container. As a consequence, all planning and pricing 
</p>
<p>decisions are made in TEU or Twenty-Foot-Equivalent-Units, a volumetric unit of 
</p>
<p>measure equivalent to the total cube of a standard twenty feet container. Although 
</p>
<p>cargo owners may know the total weight inside a particular container, shipping 
</p>
<p>companies often only know (and care) about the TEU. Thus, emission factors com-
</p>
<p>puted by water-borne transportation are often originally computed in kilograms of 
</p>
<p>CO2-e per TEU-kilometer and then converted into ton-kilometers by using a pre- 
</p>
<p>agreed conversion factor.
</p>
<p>Aviation
</p>
<p>Sources of emissions for aviation are all civil commercial airplanes, including gen-
</p>
<p>eral aviation such as agricultural aircraft, private jets, and helicopters. The fuel- 
</p>
<p>based methodology again uses only fuel consumption data and average emission 
</p>
<p>factors to estimate emissions, and is suitable for aircraft using aviation gasoline or 
</p>
<p>when operational data for jet-fueled vehicles are not available. A fuel-based 
</p>
<p>approach can also be estimated by calculating emissions separately for the cruise 
</p>
<p>phase of a flight and the landing/take-off (LTO) phase. This requires knowing the 
</p>
<p>number of LTOs and separating the fuel consumed during this phase from the cruise 
</p>
<p>phase, but it allows for using emissions factors that capture differences in emissions, 
</p>
<p>specially CH4 and N2O, during these phases.
</p>
<p>Distance-based methods can be based on origin-destination (OD) data or full 
</p>
<p>flight trajectory information. The OD approach accounts for different flight dis-
</p>
<p>tances, which changes the relative impact of the LTO phase compared to the cruise 
</p>
<p>phase. The full flight trajectory model uses aircraft&mdash;and engine-specific perfor-
</p>
<p>mance information over the entire flight, requiring engine performance modeling.
</p>
<p>An additional complexity in aviation has to do with the allocation of emissions 
</p>
<p>between people and freight, because they share the same airplane when cargo is 
</p>
<p>loaded onto commercial flights. The most accurate way to allocate emissions is to 
</p>
<p>E.E. Blanco and Y. Sheffi</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>157
</p>
<p>use the ratio of weight used by passengers (and their bags) vs. the weight of freight, 
</p>
<p>because weight is what determines the amount of fuel consumed during the flight. 
</p>
<p>However, airlines do not plan routes using this criteria; instead, they evaluate the 
</p>
<p>economics of each flight and the revenue from the various services they offer. Thus, 
</p>
<p>emissions could be allocated based on the revenue of passenger vs. freight as a 
</p>
<p>proxy to the planning approach. Even this approach has further complications 
</p>
<p>because first class, business, and economy fares are sold at different rates on every 
</p>
<p>flight as part of yield management strategy, varying the revenue profile of each flight 
</p>
<p>and &ldquo;underutilizing&rdquo; the maximum weight potential of a flight. A third approach 
</p>
<p>would be to allocate a fixed share of emissions to freight on a flight, recognizing that 
</p>
<p>airlines often plan and balance their network using revenue targets. The EN 16258 
</p>
<p>(see Sect. 7.3.3) has favored this latter approach, recommending a factor between 70 
</p>
<p>and 80 % of emissions to be allocated to freight on commercial flight, regardless of 
</p>
<p>actual load capacity or revenue. This number, although arbitrary, is a result of a 
</p>
<p>consultation process with experts from academia and industry trying to balance 
</p>
<p>accuracy of emissions with practical business matters of data collection and consis-
</p>
<p>tency in reporting.
</p>
<p>7.2.1.3  Carbon Footprint Calculations in Transportation: A Primer
</p>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the most accurate method for calcula-
</p>
<p>tion carbon footprints of transportation emissions is to use fuel records of the con-
</p>
<p>veyance (see Eq. 7.1).
</p>
<p>However, since most transportation activities often involve multiple organiza-
</p>
<p>tions (e.g., shipper and carrier) and may further involve other intermediaries such as 
</p>
<p>freight forwarders or 3PLs, weight-distance activity-based calculations are more 
</p>
<p>commonly used in practice (see Sect. 7.2.1.1). The carbon footprint calculation 
</p>
<p>using this approach is often estimated as a function of the shipment weight (w) or 
</p>
<p>volume (v), the distance (d), and a mode-specific emission factor (EF). The most 
</p>
<p>basic relationship is multiplicative as follows:
</p>
<p> 
e d w d w e d v d v( , ) ( , )= &times; &times; = &times; &times;EFor EF
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The shipment weight is the gross weight of the product being transported (including 
</p>
<p>all primary and secondary packaging). This information is often well known by the 
</p>
<p>shipper. The distance is the total over-the-road, over-the-air, over-the-track, or over- 
</p>
<p>the- waterway distance traveled by the shipment. This number may not always be 
</p>
<p>accurate or easily available for the shipper, but it is often known by the carrier or 
</p>
<p>asset owner, or can be approximated by using over-the-air distances multiplied by 
</p>
<p>an adjustment factor. Such approximations should be avoided (if possible) since 
</p>
<p>they add another level of uncertainty to the calculation.
</p>
<p>The final component, the emission factor EF, is the most critical element of this 
</p>
<p>computation. As discussed earlier in this section, there are multiple sources that 
</p>
<p>publish values that are commonly used by practitioners (see Table 7.3). Ideally, 
</p>
<p>these emissions factors should be gathered directly from fuel consumption records 
</p>
<p>7 Green Logistics</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>158
</p>
<p>from the carrier or vessel operator (see Sect. 7.5.4), but are most commonly a result 
</p>
<p>of carrier surveys, econometric models or engine fuel consumption modeling. Fuel 
</p>
<p>consumption models allow for more accurate functional forms of e(d, w).
</p>
<p>The modeling and data collection undertaken by NTM is one of the most com-
</p>
<p>prehensive and detailed methodologies available to estimate emission factors of 
</p>
<p>transportation. Based on the excellent summary by Hoen et al. (2014a) of NTM 
</p>
<p>recommended calculations, the following sections summarize functional forms of 
</p>
<p>carbon footprint calculations for different modes of transportation. For all calcula-
</p>
<p>tions, the resulting calculation emissions are expressed in kilograms of CO2. 
</p>
<p>Distance d is expressed in kilometers, weight w in kilograms, and volume v in m3.
</p>
<p>Air Transport

<p>Emissions of air transportation can be estimated as follows:

<p>W1 is the aircraft maximum payload in kg

<p>λ1 is the aircraft payload utilization % for the specific trip
</p>
<p>E1 are the emissions (kg of CO2) corresponding to take-off and landing. These emis-
</p>
<p>sions are a function of the actual aircraft payload W
1 1
&times;l
</p>
<p>ϵ1 kilograms of CO2 per kilometer (kg of CO2/km)
</p>
<p>For a Boeing 757-200SF, the maximum payload is W1 is 29,029 kg. When fully 
</p>
<p>loaded (e.g., l
1
100= % ), E

75= %  of maximum capacity, E
</p>
<p>1
4041 709= .  and 
</p>
<p>1
15 351= . . Thus, the share 
</p>
<p>of emissions associated to moving a 500 kg shipment for 1000 km will be 342.66 kg 
</p>
<p>CO2 in a fully loaded Boeing 757-200SF and 445.36 kg CO2 if the aircraft will be 
</p>
<p>loaded at 75 % payload capacity.
</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, aircraft payload capacity between passenger and cargo 
</p>
<p>needs to be adequately accounted for. Also, air shipments are often priced volu-
</p>
<p>metrically. In that case w v= &times;r , where ρ is the shipment density. This density will 
</p>
<p>vary by product and may also be adjusted for pricing purposes.

</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>W2 is the vehicle maximum payload in kg
</p>
<p>λ2 is the vehicle payload utilization % for the specific trip
</p>
<p>ϵ2 kilograms of CO2 per kilometer (kg of CO2/km).
</p>
<p>Commonly used transport vehicles (tractor+trailer) have a maximum payload 
</p>
<p>W2 of 26,000 kg. To estimate ϵ2, NTM recommends taking into account fuel effi-
</p>
<p>ciency, type of road, load factor, and terrain slope. NTM estimates that diesel con-
</p>
<p>sumption for an unloaded freight vehicle with a payload capacity of 26,000 kg is 
</p>
<p>0.226, 0.230, and 0.288 L per km for highway, rural, and city environments, respec-
</p>
<p>tively. At the other extreme, a fully loaded vehicle consumes 0.360, 0.396, and 
</p>
<p>0.504 L per km in highway, rural, and city roads. Other load factors may be linearly 
</p>
<p>interpolated between these numbers. Thus, for a load factor of 70 %, fuel consump-
</p>
<p>tion will be 0.3198, 0.3462, and 0.4392 L per km for highway, rural, and city roads, 
</p>
<p>respectively. Assuming diesel emissions are 2.621 kg CO2 per L, ϵ2 for a l2 70= %  
</p>
<p>loaded vehicle will be given by 2 621 0 3198 0 8382. . .&sdot; =  kg CO2 per km. An addi-
</p>
<p>tional adjustment to fuel consumption may be applied to take into account the steep-
</p>
<p>ness of the terrain. For instance, Hoen et al. (2014a) estimate a European wide 
</p>
<p>adjustment of an additional 5 % to account to terrain. Thus 
2
</p>
<p>0 8382 1 05 0 8801= &sdot; =. . . .
</p>
<p>Therefore, the share of emissions associated to moving a 500 kg shipment for 
</p>
<p>1000 km will be 11.85 kg CO2 in a 70 % utilized 26,000 kg diesel powered vehicle. 
</p>
<p>Note that for road transport, the allocation of empty miles have a noticeable impact 
</p>
<p>on final shipment emission calculations.
</p>
<p>Rail Transport
</p>
<p>Since only a handful of national rail operators provide rail transport service by 
</p>
<p>country, it is often most reliable to obtain the emission factor directly from rail 
</p>
<p>transport companies. These factors take into account overall locomotive efficiency, 
</p>
<p>including electric and diesel powered technology, as well as required boxcar repo-
</p>
<p>sitioning throughout the network. Thus, emissions can be simply calculated as 
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p> 
e d w d w
rail
( , ) = &sdot; &sdot;
</p>
<p>3  
</p>
<p>where
</p>

</p>
<p>The EPA estimates this number to be 1.713 10&minus;5 kg of CO2 per kg-km for the US 
</p>
<p>rail network. Hoen et al. (2014a) present a detailed derivation of rail emission factor 
</p>
<p>for Europe, that takes into account a combination of electric and diesel power dis-
</p>
<p>tance and hilly terrain. The resulting value was 2 223 10 5. &sdot; &minus;  kg of CO2 per kg-km.

</p>
<p>FC4 is the vehicle fuel consumption in L per km
</p>
<p>FE4 are the fuel emissions in kg of CO2 per L
</p>
<p>The cargo capacity of an inland cargo vessel is 3,840,000 kg. Inland cargo ves-
</p>
<p>sels often have low utilization levels, close to 50 %. Vessel fuel consumption is in 
</p>
<p>the order of 0.007 t of diesel per km and diesel emissions of approximately 3178 kg 
</p>
<p>of CO2 per t of diesel. Using these parameters, the share of emissions associated to 
</p>
<p>moving a 500 kg shipment for 1000 km via inland waterways will be 5.79 kg CO2.
</p>
<p>In the case of ocean shipping, it is often advised to use carrier-specific emission 
</p>
<p>factors, such as the ones published by the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG), 
</p>
<p>although similar calculations as the ones used above can be estimated by adjusting 
</p>
<p>the fuel type used (often bunker fuel oil).
</p>
<p>7.2.2  Pollution
</p>
<p>Pollution is the introduction of a substance&mdash;solid, liquid, or gas&mdash;into a system 
</p>
<p>that can have adverse consequences on humans or the natural ecosystem. In the case 
</p>
<p>of logistics and transportation, the most important environmental impacts are due to 
</p>
<p>air and water pollution generated during the operation of trucks, airplanes, locomo-
</p>
<p>tives, and vessels. Unlike GHG emissions that have global effects, pollution impacts 
</p>
<p>tend to be local to cities, ports, trade lanes, or freight corridors, although pollutants 
</p>
<p>can also travel long distances and have global effects.
</p>
<p>7.2.2.1  Air Pollution
</p>
<p>The use of internal combustion engines in trucks, airplanes, ships, and locomotive 
</p>
<p>engines that move freight is the major source of air pollution. There are six common 
</p>
<p>air pollutants, also known as &ldquo;criteria pollutants&rdquo; in combustion: particle pollution 
</p>
<p>(often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sul-
</p>
<p>fur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead (EPA 2015a):
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Ground-level ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but it is created by chemi-
cal reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds 
</p>
<p>(VOC) in the presence of sunlight.
</p>
<p>E.E. Blanco and Y. Sheffi</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>161
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Particulate matter (PM) is a mixture of extremely small particles and liquid 
droplets. PM is made up of a number of components, including acids (such as 
</p>
<p>nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. The 
</p>
<p>size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. 
</p>
<p>The EPA regulations focuses on particles that are 10 μm (PM10) in diameter or 
</p>
<p>smaller because those generally pass through the throat and nose and enter the 
</p>
<p>lungs.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas emitted from combustion 
processes. Nationally, and particularly in urban areas, the majority of CO emis-
</p>
<p>sions to ambient air come from transportation activities (both passenger and 
</p>
<p>freight). CO can cause harmful health effects by reducing oxygen delivery to the 
</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s organs (like the heart and brain) and tissues. At extremely high levels, CO 
</p>
<p>can cause death.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Nitrogen Oxides&mdash;or NOx&mdash;are a family of seven compounds, of which NO2 is 
the most prevalent form. About 50 % of all NOx come from mobile sources 
</p>
<p>including automobiles, trucks, and vessels (EPA 2014). They are generated dur-
</p>
<p>ing the combustion process of engines as a function of the ratio of fuel and oxy-
</p>
<p>gen. In addition to contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone, and 
</p>
<p>fine-particle pollution, NOx are linked with a number of adverse effects on the 
</p>
<p>respiratory system. The amount of NOx can be controlled through several means: 
</p>
<p>engine design, regulating the oxygen and fuel mix, maintaining optimal tempera-
</p>
<p>ture levels within the engine, changing fuel types, or adding a catalytic converter. 
</p>
<p>All of these actions have an impact on fuel economy, sometimes positive or nega-
</p>
<p>tive, and they are very dependent on individual engine configurations (EPA 
</p>
<p>2014).
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Sulfur oxides&mdash;or SOx&mdash;are highly reactive gases of which sulfur dioxide (SO2) 
is the most prevalent form in transportation. SOx is linked with a number of 
</p>
<p>adverse effects on the respiratory system. The largest sources of SOx emissions 
</p>
<p>come from fossil fuel combustion at power plants (73 %) and other industrial 
</p>
<p>facilities (20 %). Smaller sources of SOx emissions include industrial processes 
</p>
<p>such as extracting metal from ore, and the burning of high sulfur containing fuels 
</p>
<p>by locomotives, large ships, and non-road equipment. Although maritime trans-
</p>
<p>portation represents a small share of global SOx emissions, the emissions tend to 
</p>
<p>accumulate in higher concentrations near ports and then travel to neighboring 
</p>
<p>population centers. SOx emissions are increasingly being regulated across Europe  
</p>
<p>and are part of the focus areas of the maritime industry as whole (IMO 2015).
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Lead is a naturally occurring element that can be harmful to humans when 
ingested or inhaled. Lead poisoning is particularly detrimental to the neurologi-
</p>
<p>cal development of children. The major sources of lead emissions have histori-
</p>
<p>cally been from fuels in on-road motor vehicles (such as cars and trucks) and 
</p>
<p>industrial sources. As a result of US and EU regulatory efforts to remove lead 
</p>
<p>from on-road motor vehicle gasoline, emissions of lead from the transportation 
</p>
<p>sector dramatically declined by 95 % between 1980 and 1999, and levels of lead 
</p>
<p>in the air decreased by 94 % between 1980 and 1999. The major sources of lead 
</p>
<p>emissions to the air today are ore and metals processing and piston-engine air-
</p>
<p>craft operating on leaded aviation gasoline.

</p>
<p>Reliable global figures are not available, but the European Environment Agency 
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 7.2) estimates that international shipping represents 16 % of SOx emis-
</p>
<p>sions, 15 % of NOx emissions, 10 % of PM2.5, and 5 % of PM10. Road transport 
</p>
<p>(both passenger and freight) represents 32 % of NOx emissions, 9 % of PM2.5, and 
</p>
<p>5 % PM10. Aviation mainly contributes to NOx emissions (5 %), while railways 
</p>
<p>have negligible emissions compared to other sources.
</p>
<p>The levels of air pollution generated by engines are heavily dependent on the 
</p>
<p>vehicle engine technology as well as operational conditions such as speed, road 
</p>
<p>geometry, wind speeds, and altitude. Table 7.2 compares emission rates (grams per 
</p>
<p>mile) of a diesel heavy-duty vehicle. PM and SOx emissions don&rsquo;t vary by speed, but 
</p>
<p>NOx emissions increase significantly at higher speeds (Table 7.4).
</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that noticeable progress has been made in reducing all 
</p>
<p>sources of air pollutants in the transport sector since 1990 (see Fig. 7.3).
</p>
<p>An important consideration related to air pollution is the trade-off between GHG 
</p>
<p>emissions, fuel efficiency, and cost. A comprehensive field study commissioned by 
</p>
<p>Defra in the UK illustrates this complexity. Figure 7.4 shows the overall progress 
</p>
<p>achieved through legislation: a steady reduction of the ratio of NOx vs. CO2 emis-
</p>
<p>sions. Although diesel fuels have achieved significant reductions in absolute CO2

<p>treaty instrument covering the prevention of pollution by ships. It sets out regulations 
</p>
<p>dealing with pollution from ships by oil; by noxious liquid substances carried in 
</p>
<p>bulk; by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged form; by sewage; by gar-
</p>
<p>bage; and with the prevention of air pollution from ships.
</p>
<p>7.2.3  Noise and Vibration
</p>
<p>The goal of establishing acceptable noise levels is to avoid hearing loss in people 
</p>
<p>over their lifespan, as well as to allow for a comfortable environment to work and 
</p>
<p>rest. In 1974, the EPA determined that a 24-h exposure level of 70 decibels (dB) to 
</p>
<p>be the threshold that will prevent any measurable hearing loss over a lifetime. Levels 
</p>
<p>of 55 dB outdoors and 45 dB indoors were considered as acceptable levels for nor-
</p>
<p>mal activity. These levels are not peak levels, but 8&ndash;24-h averages.
</p>
<p>Table 7.6 presents some reference activities and their noise levels.
</p>
<p>Noise levels related to freight transportation activities (traffic 70 dB, trains 100 
</p>
<p>dB, and airplanes 130 dB) are above the recommended 70 dB threshold level. This 
</p>
<p>limits the amount of time that freight activities should be allowed near heavily pop-
</p>
<p>ulation centers. Localities often require stricter noise levels after 6 pm and before 6 
</p>
<p>am in residential areas, to further mitigate disruption to audible quality of life.
</p>
<p>7.2.4  Packaging Waste
</p>
<p>Packaging is used to sell, inform, contain, protect, preserve, and transport products 
</p>
<p>(Soroka 1999). After product use, all packaging joins the waste stream.
</p>
<p>There are three main types of packaging (Saphire 1994):
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Manufacturer-provided packaging. This is the primary packaging that protects 
and preserves the product. In some cases, this packaging also informs and helps

<p>to sell the product contained within. As a customer decides which product to 
</p>
<p>purchase, the packaging has the ability to draw the customer in with its design, 
</p>
<p>image, and attractiveness, regardless of the quality and necessity of a product 
</p>
<p>(Paine 2002).
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Transport packaging or secondary packaging. This type of packaging is used for 
the sole purpose of moving product around. Most commonly, it is used for bulk 
</p>
<p>handling of product, usually in pallet sizes to facilitate the easy transfer from 
</p>
<p>warehouse to truck or container for shipment across land, air, or sea. Its main 
</p>
<p>function is to protect the contents within from damage from the elements or 
</p>
<p>rough handling.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Parcel packaging or tertiary packaging. This is used mainly to group primary 
packages together. It is most frequently used in the retail delivery industry to 
</p>
<p>aggregate customer orders into one box, to facilitate easy delivery through the 
</p>
<p>fulfillment system.
</p>
<p>Logistics and transportation activities have direct influence on the design, use, 
</p>
<p>and disposal of secondary and tertiary packaging. Any unnecessary levels or inad-
</p>
<p>equately disposed packaging is an additional source of waste.
</p>
<p>Although detailed statistics are not available, product containers and packaging 
</p>
<p>represent 29 % of the 250 million tons of waste generated in 2010 (EPA 2015a). 
</p>
<p>Approximately 49 % of this waste is recovered (see Table 7.7), which leaves a 51 % 
</p>
<p>opportunity to either reduce packaging use or make sure that it reaches the right 
</p>
<p>recycling facilities.
</p>
<p>7.3  Measuring Green Logistics Impacts
</p>
<p>Logistics decisions are metrics driven, which means that green logistics models and

<p>initiatives require having the right measurements of the various environmental 
</p>

</p>
<p>Pollution, noise, vibration, and waste measurements are technical in nature and 
</p>
<p>can be estimated through specialized equipment. For example, the EPA or the 
</p>
<p>European Union standards (see Table 7.1) are enforced by subjecting technologies 
</p>
<p>to lab and road tests under standard conditions. Driving, weather, terrain, conges-
</p>
<p>tion, and operational conditions can dramatically change the actual environmental 
</p>
<p>impact of freight operations. In a detailed study of drayage trucks in the port of 
</p>
<p>Genoa, Zamboni et al. (2015) were able to observe differences of more than 50 % in 
</p>
<p>total fuel consumption, NOx and SOx emissions under a variety of speeds and stop 
</p>
<p>patterns. Environmental analysis of logistics operations needs to be very aware of 
</p>
<p>the various assumptions underlying commonly used emission factors. This is par-
</p>
<p>ticularly important when estimating GHG emissions.
</p>
<p>7.3.1  GHG Emission Measurement in Logistics
</p>
<p>As discussed in Sect. 7.2.1, there are important variations in emission factors across 
</p>
<p>sources (see Table 7.3). For instance, depending on the assumed (or observed) utili-
</p>
<p>zation factor of the conveyance and the granularity of data available (e.g., surveys 
</p>
<p>or fuel records), the average fuel consumption per ton of cargo transported will vary 
</p>
<p>significantly. Table 7.8 includes some of the emission factors included in the GHG 
</p>
<p>Protocol. Note that the EPA reference numbers are the same for trucks of various 
</p>
<p>engine sizes, while the Defra numbers vary dramatically between large (over 33 t) 
</p>
<p>and smaller trucks (1.3&ndash;1.7 t). This difference is due to the level of detail of data 
</p>
<p>collected by these two agencies at the moment of publication of the GHG Protocol: 
</p>
<p>the EPA was using sector-level aggregated data while Defra had access to vehicle- 
</p>
<p>level surveys. Moreover, these numbers are regularly challenged and updated as 
</p>
<p>more and better data becomes available across the logistics sector (Table 7.8).
</p>
<p>Another complexity, especially relevant to GHGs measurements, is what is and 
</p>
<p>what is not included in the emission factors and calculations.
</p>
<p>7.3.2  GHG Standards and Scopes1
</p>
<p>There are three types of standards that cover GHG impact estimations. If the intent 
</p>
<p>of the measurement is an absolute quantity for a whole company, this is known as 
</p>
<p>Corporate Carbon Footprinting. The most widely known and adopted standard is 
</p>
<p>the GHG Protocol followed by the ISO 14064. If the intent is to measure the GHG 
</p>
<p>impact of an individual product, often from cradle to grave, it is known as Product 
</p>
<p>1 The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard also includes a scope definition. Although conceptually 
related, it does not correspond to the scope definition when applied to logistics activities. See 
Chap. 3 by Boukherroub et al. (2017) for an in-depth discussion of carbon footprinting, including 
more on the GHG Protocol Scope definitions.

</p>
<p>Carbon Footprinting. The PAS-2050, ISO 14040, and the GHG Protocol Life Cycle 
</p>
<p>Accounting and Reporting Standards are well-known references. Finally, and most 
</p>
<p>recently, the EN 16258 (VTT 2012) standard for quantifying greenhouse gas emis-
</p>
<p>sions from freight focus specifically on carbon footprinting in the transportation 
</p>
<p>sector.
</p>
<p>All of these standards use emission factors and variations of the equations pre-
</p>
<p>sented in Sect. 7.2.1. One of the main differences, besides the goal itself, is the 
</p>
<p>scope of the GHG calculations. Figure 7.6 shows all the life-cycle sources of GHG 
</p>
<p>emissions of transportation services, from cradle to grave. These emissions are gen-
</p>
<p>erated at different moments in time and points in space and allocated throughout the 
</p>
<p>delivery of the service.
</p>
<p>The first layer of emissions is all the GHG emissions generated during the manu-
</p>
<p>facturing and maintenance of the trucks, airplanes, or boats. These emissions 
</p>
<p>include the energy used in the assembly plants, the extraction of raw materials, and 
</p>
<p>the operation of maintenance operations. Next are all the emissions related to the 
</p>
<p>construction and maintenance of the transportation infrastructure, including road-
</p>
<p>ways, ports, airports, and intermodal terminals. Some of this infrastructure is shared 
</p>
<p>with other services (e.g., roads are shared with bicycles and personal vehicles, ports

<p>are shared with government and military operations) and needs to be properly 
</p>
<p>allocated.
</p>
<p>In order to be able to do a complete calculation of the impact of freight transpor-
</p>
<p>tation, some share of the vehicle and infrastructure emissions should be added to 
</p>
<p>each logistic operation. This is a fairly complex and uncertain calculation that 
</p>
<p>requires very large amounts of data and assumptions. With the exception of life- 
</p>
<p>cycle analysis or product carbon footprint calculations, most of these emissions are 
</p>
<p>not included in GHG calculations in the logistics sector.
</p>
<p>This leaves emissions from &ldquo;well-to-wheel&rdquo; (WTW): these are all the emissions 
</p>
<p>related to the extraction, production, and distribution of fuels used during transpor-
</p>
<p>tation operations, up to point when the fuel is placed in the vehicle&mdash;&ldquo;well-to-tank&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(WTT)&mdash;plus all emissions generated during the combustion of this fuel during 
</p>
<p>transport operations, &ldquo;tank-to-wheel&rdquo; (TTW). The EN 16258 explicitly requires 
</p>
<p>that all transport GHG calculations include WTW emissions. Other standards, 
</p>
<p>including the GHG corporate protocol, only required TTW emissions, although 
</p>
<p>WTW were encouraged. Similarly, the EPA SmartWay program initially only 
</p>
<p>required TTW emissions and is now expanding to WTW emissions. Table 7.9 shows 
</p>
<p>the emission factor differences between TTW and WTW by fuel.
</p>
<p>7.3.3  GHG Allocation
</p>
<p>The other source of complexity is the allocation of the emissions from a corporate 
</p>
<p>or individual route level to an individual shipment. The GHG Protocol and the EPA 
</p>
<p>program favor &ldquo;simple&rdquo; activity-based approaches: first compute all the emissions

<p>vidual routes or services may have different efficiency levels, or that specific vehi-
</p>
<p>cles may have different performance metrics, in favor of a simple and consistent 
</p>
<p>calculation that can be easily adopted by many organizations. The EPA SmartWay 
</p>
<p>program does allow for tracking emissions by type of fleet (e.g., flat bed trucks vs. 
</p>
<p>drayage trucks), but it still recommends an aggregate approach for computing emis-
</p>
<p>sion factors.
</p>
<p>The EN 16258, on the other hand, favors a detailed approach. It recommends 
</p>
<p>using the product of the weight of the consignment and the actual distance trav-
</p>
<p>eled&mdash;i.e., the transport capacity measured in tonne kilometers&mdash;as the allocation 
</p>
<p>parameter. It aims at providing as accurate as possible assignment of emission fac-
</p>
<p>tors to individual packages, taking into account logistics network configurations 
</p>
<p>such as the relative location of the warehouse with respect to customers in a delivery 
</p>
<p>route. Variations of this calculation are allowed in the standard, based on the quality 
</p>
<p>of the information and type of service. An in-depth discussion of the EN 16258 
</p>
<p>standard is beyond this chapter, but this requires consistently collecting data across 
</p>
<p>every transportation route, including shipment information, sequence, and distance. 
</p>
<p>This is a gargantuan task, especially since logistics operations often include multi-
</p>
<p>ple providers with various levels of sophistication. Nevertheless, for large organiza-
</p>
<p>tions like UPS, DHL, FedEx, or Maersk, the EN 16258 does provide a framework 
</p>
<p>to develop information systems that can provide very accurate shipment level- 
</p>
<p>allocation of GHG emissions.
</p>
<p>7.3.4  GHG Metric Trade-Offs
</p>
<p>As discussed on this section, GHG Metrics will vary due to assumptions, scope, or 
</p>
<p>data availability. Standards can guide organizations&rsquo; choices, but designing metrics 
</p>
<p>that excel in all dimensions is not practically possible. Instead, firms must choose 
</p>
<p>metrics that trade off between certain criteria. Two of the primary trade-offs are 
</p>
<p>between integrative and useful metrics, and between robust and valid metrics 
</p>
<p>(Caplice and Sheffi 1994) (Fig. 7.7).
</p>
<p>Integrative metrics promote coordination across functions, while useful metrics 
</p>
<p>are easily understood and provide managers with direct guidance. Providing 
</p>
<p> managers with actionable guidance requires a level of specificity that makes pro-
</p>
<p>moting coordination across functions difficult. In this sense, measuring the carbon 
</p>
<p>footprint of transportation is a useful metric, because it provides guidance on one 
</p>
<p>specific aspect but not across functions. As such, it must be incorporated as one 
</p>
<p>metric in an entire performance measurement system that covers both environmen-
</p>
<p>tal and non- environmental aspects across the functions of the supply chain.
</p>
<p>E.E. Blanco and Y. Sheffi</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>171
</p>
<p>The other trade-off is between a robust metric that allows for comparability and 
</p>
<p>a valid metric that captures specific aspects. A valid metric, such as the ones favored 
</p>
<p>by the EN16258, provides help with making a specific decision but is less suitable 
</p>
<p>to external uses where it might be compared with similar metrics for other organiza-
</p>
<p>tions, unlike the GHG Protocol or EPA approaches.
</p>
<p>7.4  Green Logistics Strategies
</p>
<p>As discussed in the previous sections, logistics activities, though integral to the 
</p>
<p>economic and social development, negatively impact the environment on multiple 
</p>
<p>dimensions. The goal of green logistics is to mitigate the environmental impact of 
</p>
<p>logistics&mdash;related activities.
</p>
<p>As governments and companies have increased their focus on green logistics, 
</p>
<p>numerous &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; and frameworks have been proposed (Craig et al. 2013). 
</p>
<p>However, as the impacts outlined in the previous section show, there are five main 
</p>
<p>logistics variables that, when combined, drive the environmental impact of 
</p>
<p>logistics:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Distance. How far are products being moved? Where are they loaded/unloaded?
&bull;	 Mode. Which mode of transportation is being used?
&bull;	 Equipment. What kind of equipment is being used for the logistics operation? 
</p>
<p>What kind of fuel and how much fuel does it consume?
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Load. How much product is being loaded into the conveyance? How efficiently 
is it loaded?
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Operation. How skillful is the driver in operating the vehicle? How optimal is the 
logistics plan?
</p>
<p>Each of these variables is a lever that can be used toward designing greener logis-
</p>
<p>tics systems: distance reduction, modal shift, cleaner equipment, better load plan-
</p>
<p>ning, and operational excellence.

<p>172
</p>
<p>All business decisions, including logistics and transportation, are made at the 
</p>
<p>strategic, tactical, or operational level (Stank and Goldsby 2000). Strategic deci-
</p>
<p>sions are revisited every 3&ndash;5 years, tactical decisions are often done with a 6-month 
</p>
<p>to 2-year horizon in mind, and operational level decisions are made on a daily and 
</p>
<p>weekly basis. Thus, decisions at strategic, tactical, and operational level are oppor-
</p>
<p>tunities to mitigate the environmental impact of logistics by flexing one or more of 
</p>
<p>the five green logistics levers.
</p>
<p>Table 7.10 shows a non-exhaustive list of green logistics strategies for each of the 
</p>
<p>five levers across the three decision levels. These strategies require a combination of 
</p>
<p>business and analytical approaches in logistics. Some of these strategies may appear 
</p>
<p>simplistic or obvious, but they matter in practice. For instance, everyone recognizes 
</p>
<p>that idling vehicles consumes fuel unnecessarily. According to the EPA SmartWay 
</p>
<p>program, long-duration idling of truck and locomotive engines consumes more than 
</p>
<p>1 billion gallons of diesel fuel per year, emits 11 million tons of carbon dioxide, 
</p>
<p>200,000 t of oxides of nitrogen, 5000 t of particulate matter, and elevates noise lev-
</p>
<p>els (EPA 2015a). But only when there is a managerial commitment to reduce these 
</p>
<p>impacts are the required actions taken, even when they are economically sound. 
</p>
<p>Walmart, for examples, outfitted its 7000-vehicle truck fleet with auxiliary power 
</p>
<p>units (APUs). Walmart estimated an 18-month payback period through fuel and 
</p>
<p>engine wear savings, in addition to all associated environmental benefits.
</p>
<p>The next two sections will expand on two well-studied modeling approaches&mdash;
</p>
<p>network design and vehicle-routing&mdash;that are commonly used in logistics decision- 
</p>
<p>making and that have direct applicability on all levers at the strategic, tactical, and 
</p>
<p>operational level. Business-centric dimensions will be further explored in the case 
</p>
<p>studies of Sect. 7.4, focusing on real-life implementation challenges.
</p>
<p>7.4.1  Network Design
</p>
<p>Logistics network design is a strategic decision that has direct impact on two of the 
</p>
<p>most important levers for green logistics: distance reduction and mode shift. It 
</p>
<p>includes decisions related to the location of manufacturing plants, assembly facili-
</p>
<p>ties and multiple tiers of warehouses, as well as deciding how products flow through 
</p>
<p>the network from suppliers to customers.
</p>
<p>As elegantly summarized by Magnanti and Wong (1984), the basic ingredients of 
</p>
<p>all network design models are a set of nodes (N) and a set of directed arcs (A) that 
</p>
<p>are available to design the network. There are two types of decisions in network 
</p>
<p>design models: (a) discrete-choice decisions relating to selecting which nodes and 
</p>
<p>which arcs should be included in the final network and (b) decisions about the flow 
</p>
<p>of one or multiple commodities from supply to demand nodes along the selected 
</p>
<p>network. To find the optimal solution, mathematical models trade-off a variety of 
</p>
<p>fixed and variable costs, as well as minimum and maximum flows, through each arc 
</p>
<p>and node.

<p>7 Green Logistics</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Network design models are widely used and studied in logistics planning 
</p>
<p>decisions, ranging from global flows (see Goetschalckx et al. 2002) to locating sin-
</p>
<p>gle facilities (see Melo et al. 2009). These models often include cost and service 
</p>
<p>trade-offs.
</p>
<p>Adding environmental considerations can be achieved by augmenting a tradi-
</p>
<p>tional network flow model with an environmental cost or an environmental 
</p>
<p>constraint.
</p>
<p>For instance, when deciding to open or close a facility in a network, there is often 
</p>
<p>a fixed cost plus a variable cost driven by productivity, capacity, or labor choices. 
</p>
<p>Because operating facilities may also generate environmental impacts that may vary 
</p>
<p>by these same choices (e.g., pollution, GHG emissions), an &ldquo;environmental cost&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>may be added to each candidate facility and then added as part of the objective func-
</p>
<p>tion to minimize total emissions or as constraint to limit the total environmental 
</p>
<p>impacts (see Chap. 9 by Vel&aacute;zquez and Fransoo (2017)).
</p>
<p>Another common variation to network flow models to take into account green 
</p>
<p>impacts, is related to the flows through the network. Since every arc in the network 
</p>
<p>represents the movement of one or more commodities via a mode of transportation, 
</p>
<p>the model could explicitly estimate the environmental impact of this move using 
</p>
<p>mode-specific emission factors. For example, Table 7.3 includes the amount of CO2 
</p>
<p>emitted per ton-mile for various modes. By multiplying these factors to the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding arc-flow variables, the model can estimate the total CO2 emissions of a 
</p>
<p>particular transportation network configuration. These total transportation emis-
</p>
<p>sions could also be added to an objective function or part of a constraint to limit total 
</p>
<p>emission costs. Because different transportation modes have different speeds, they 
</p>
<p>will also have inventory impacts. To fully capture the network environmental 
</p>
<p>impact, factors that measure the increased in emissions due to extra holding inven-
</p>
<p>tory may also be needed (e.g., extra energy required to hold extra inventory, extra 
</p>
<p>waste generated due to increase obsolescence).
</p>
<p>Hoen et al. (2014b) conducted a comprehensive modeling and analysis of the 
</p>
<p>economic and environmental impact of selecting various transportation modes to 
</p>
<p>fulfill customer orders for Cargill. They modeled the impact on revenue, inventory, 
</p>
<p>and costs, and traded it off with total CO2 emissions. Figure 7.8 shows their results 
</p>
<p>as a trade-off curve between reduction of emissions vs. cost increase.
</p>
<p>Although the trade-off curve will vary depending on the specific network con-
</p>
<p>figuration, economics, and mode choices available, it often has a similar shape: it 
</p>
<p>is possible to achieve noticeable environmental reductions without adding signifi-
</p>
<p>cant extra cost to the logistics network. In the case study analyzed by Hoen et al., 
</p>
<p>10 % CO2 reductions can be achieved by adding less than 1 % in cost. Achieving 
</p>
<p>higher CO2 reductions (e.g., 25 %), however, will require a significant cost increase 
</p>
<p>(e.g., 15 %).
</p>
<p>In addition to the cost vs. environment trade-off analysis, analyzing various sce-
</p>
<p>narios can yield important insights to the network topology. Figure 7.9 shows the 
</p>
<p>different network configurations for an apparel manufacturer in the USA under dif-
</p>
<p>ferent scenarios. In this case, the optimal cost scenario will open four warehouses,

</p>
<p>compared to five or six facilities if the company would like to reduce 10 % and 25 % 
</p>
<p>of total CO2 emissions in the network, respectively. More importantly, by looking at 
</p>
<p>which facilities are selected under each scenario, logistics planners may elect to 
</p>
<p>evaluate hybrid solutions that balance economic and environmental objectives.
</p>
<p>7.4.2  Vehicle Routing
</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum of network design is the daily execution of logistics 
</p>
<p>activities. This includes warehouse operations (e.g., receiving, unloading, loading, 
</p>
<p>storing, picking, and packing) and distribution operations (e.g., load building, prod-
</p>
<p>uct delivery, and product collection).
</p>
<p>The design of the network and customer requirements limit the mode choices 
</p>
<p>available for distribution operations, but there are still several levers that could be 
</p>
<p>influenced directly, such as distance, equipment, and load building. Vehicle routing 
</p>
<p>and scheduling is often the most environmentally intensive activity (from an energy 
</p>
<p>and GHG perspective) because it is during the physical delivery of products that 
</p>
<p>fuel is consumed and that the majority of transport emissions are generated 
</p>
<p>(see Fig. 7.1).
</p>
<p>There is a large body of literature devoted to solving vehicle routing problems 
</p>
<p>(VRP) (see Laporte 2009 for a comprehensive review). These models almost always 
</p>
<p>focus on minimizing distance, time, or cost of the planned routes. Although highly 
</p>
<p>correlated, solving for minimum distance does not always translate into minimizing 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts (Bektaş and Laporte 2011).
</p>
<p>A similar approach to add environmental measurements to network design prob-
</p>
<p>lem, can be used to modify vehicle routing models: explicitly calculate the factors 
</p>
<p>affecting fuel consumption and pollution such as equipment characteristics, cus-
</p>
<p>tomer time windows, product loaded during each leg of the route, speed of travel, 
</p>
<p>slope of the road network, and congestion. These variations of VRP models are 
</p>
<p>known as &ldquo;pollution-routing problems&rdquo; or PRP (Bektaş and Laporte 2011; Ko&ccedil; 
</p>
<p>et al. 2014).
</p>
<p>PRP problems explicitly capture the environmental impacts of vehicle routing 
</p>
<p>operations. Assigning a vehicle to a route is one example. Besides differences in 
</p>
<p>fuel consumption (that are part of the variable costs of operating a vehicle), dif-
</p>
<p>ferent types of vehicle technologies have different environmental impacts (see 
</p>
<p>Table 7.11).
</p>
<p>Speed of travel is another dimension of vehicle operations that is relevant in PRP 
</p>
<p>problems. Figure 7.10 shows fuel consumption by speed for a light-weight vehicle. 
</p>
<p>We can notice the U-shape of the curve leading to an optimal speed at 40 km/h. 
</p>
<p>As vehicles are assigned to various road segments in a network with varying speeds, 
</p>
<p>the total emissions generated may vary (e.g., highways or local roads). For instance, 
</p>
<p>Staples was able to achieve an increase in fuel efficiency from 8.5 to 10.4 miles per 
</p>
<p>gallon by limiting driver speeds to 60 miles per hour without impacting delivery 
</p>
<p>E.E. Blanco and Y. Sheffi</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>177
</p>
<p>performance (Staples 2012). Also, for vehicle routing problems with time windows, 
</p>
<p>tracking environmental impact at various speeds is more relevant due to the interac-
</p>
<p>tion with customer service expectations.
</p>
<p>Although fuel efficiency equations by vehicle type and speed are already com-
</p>
<p>plex, they can also be augmented to add payload impacts: the amount of fuel

</p>
<p>consumed while traveling at a certain speed increases with the amount of cargo 
</p>
<p>hauled (Barth and Boriboonsomsin 2009). Thus, it is theoretically possible to reduce 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts on vehicle routes by giving priority to deliver large payloads 
</p>
<p>early in the route, due to the potential to continue the route with a lighter load. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, by modeling road slopes or stop lights, one can further explore route 
</p>
<p>variations that can further reduce fuel consumption and emissions. UPS delivery 
</p>
<p>routes, for example, are designed to minimize left turns, which require vehicles to 
</p>
<p>wait at an intersection for traffic to clear before making the turn. UPS has lowered 
</p>
<p>CO2 emissions by 100,000 metric tons (UPS 2015). 
</p>
<p>7.5  Case Studies: Implementing Green Logistics Strategies
</p>
<p>The strategies included in Table 7.10 are known to reduce emissions and, in some 
</p>
<p>cases, also drive cost savings. Nevertheless, companies often have trouble imple-
</p>
<p>menting them.
</p>
<p>One of the challenges is focus: these initiatives are not always management 
</p>
<p>priority. Another key obstacle is that they require internal and external collabora-
</p>
<p>tion. The logistics function interfaces with multiple business activities and supports 
</p>
<p>a wide range of decisions. Client-supplier relationships, outsourcing arrangements, 
</p>
<p>cost sharing, and coordination between trading partners are a few examples.
</p>
<p>The following four case studies illustrate how, through collaboration, green 
</p>
<p>logistics initiatives were put into practice.2 The case studies focus on some of the 
</p>
<p>unique business considerations and details required to make green logistics success-
</p>
<p>ful in practice. The first case study discusses how Boise was able to shift from truck 
</p>
<p>to rail shipments and increase its load utilization by working with its customers on 
</p>
<p>service and inventory impacts and through internal improvements of package 
</p>
<p>design. The second case study also discusses modal shift, but this time achieved by 
</p>
<p>two competitors sharing &ldquo;empty miles&rdquo; of a rail backhaul leg. The third case study 
</p>
<p>is an example of a package redesign in Caterpillar&rsquo;s inbound network that that 
</p>
<p>reduces shipment weight and thus consumes less transportation fuel. The section 
</p>
<p>concludes by describing the EPA SmartWay program, a multi-stakeholder voluntary 
</p>
<p>collaboration that has incentivized companies to prioritize green logistics efforts by 
</p>
<p>providing the right incentives and transparency to the process.
</p>
<p>2 The first three cases studies in this section closely follow &ldquo;Delivering on the Promise of Green 
Logistics,&rdquo; by Edgar Blanco and Ken Cotrill (Blanco and Cottrill 2013).

<p>Boise, Inc. manufactures a wide range of packaging and paper products, with

<p>largest percentage of the CO2 emissions associated with logistics operations. Rail 
</p>
<p>transport is more cost effective and emits much less carbon per equivalent weight 
</p>
<p>and distance, but it&rsquo;s also slower and less flexible than trucking.
</p>
<p>As part of its cost and environmental efforts, Boise developed two initiatives. In 
</p>
<p>the first one, called Carload Direct, Boise needed to coordinate with its long-time 
</p>
<p>partner OfficeMax. Prior to the initiative, shipments from Boise were routinely 
</p>
<p>moved by truck to the retailer&rsquo;s facilities, even when the destinations were accessi-
</p>
<p>ble by rail. OfficeMax became a test case for switching to direct-by-rail shipments. 
</p>
<p>The two companies&rsquo; longstanding relationship helped Boise negotiate the change, 
</p>
<p>but the Boise team was still tasked to make sure the transition did not disrupt 
</p>
<p>OfficeMax&rsquo;s ordering process.
</p>
<p>The benefits of the change, carbon-wise, were significant: a traditional truckload 
</p>
<p>shipment comprises about 20 t of paper product, whereas a railcar carries around 
</p>
<p>70 t. The main drawback to the process is that a rail solution required customer 
</p>
<p>orders to be warehoused until there was enough freight to fill a boxcar. This meant 
</p>
<p>that the time from order placement to delivery was potentially extended, while run-
</p>
<p>ning the risk that inventory needed by stores would be stuck in a warehouse. By 
</p>
<p>coordinating the ordering process, the Boise team was able to determine when 
</p>
<p>enough OfficeMax orders were available to &ldquo;pool&rdquo; into a Carload Direct shipment 
</p>
<p>or when a regular truck shipment was the best option.
</p>
<p>The solution may seem straightforward, but it required extensive cooperation 
</p>
<p>between the transportation departments at Boise and OfficeMax. For example, 
</p>
<p>ordering processes had to be adjusted and coordinated to take account of the change 
</p>
<p>in product flows. Not every SKU was suitable for a Carload Direct shipment, so the 
</p>
<p>teams had to select products that could be part of the pooling system. And the 
</p>
<p>changes had to be made without altering the inventory positions or service levels of 
</p>
<p>either enterprise, especially OfficeMax. The shift from using a mix of truck and rail 
</p>
<p>to primarily rail between the major Boise and OfficeMax distribution centers elimi-
</p>
<p>nated more than 2600 t of CO2, a 70 % reduction compared to truckload shipments, 
</p>
<p>or the equivalent of saving over 264,000 gal of fuel consumed by road vehicles. 
</p>
<p>3 The Boise organization described in this case study refers to Boise Cascade LLC, the paper and 
forest products. It should not be confused with Boise Cascade Corporation that is now OfficeMax 
Incorporated.

</p>
<p>Both companies benefitted from this greener supply chain as the reduced transporta-
</p>
<p>tion costs were shared between them.
</p>
<p>For the second initiative, Boise looked at its packaging and loading processes. 
</p>
<p>Paper products are often ordered in large quantities and shipped in full pallets. Boise 
</p>
<p>field operations noticed that full pallets did not always maximize the space in the 
</p>
<p>rail boxcars. Boise redesigned its pallets and loading procedures to accommodate a 
</p>
<p>half-pallet, which allowed Boise to reorganize pallet stacking and maximize ship-
</p>
<p>ping capacities for its loads. Once the operational configuration was solved, Boise 
</p>
<p>needed to work with its customers to allow orders that included a half-pallet size.
</p>
<p>Boise created new SKUs and modified ordering and receiving systems to allow 
</p>
<p>for the new half-pallet product configuration. The company realized that this was a 
</p>
<p>win-win situation; the half-pallet solution was a perfect fit for companies that 
</p>
<p>shipped seasonal and low-demand products. Using just 930 railcars in 2011, Boise 
</p>
<p>reduced the company&rsquo;s CO2 emissions by 190 t or 6.8 % of its annual rail shipment 
</p>
<p>emissions without any extra cost. This is equal to the CO2 emissions from 21,600 
</p>
<p>gal of fuel, or the annual GHG emissions from 38 passenger vehicles. In addition to 
</p>
<p>improving the environmental performance of Boise and participating customers, the 
</p>
<p>smaller, the half-pallet unit gave Boise and its customers more order flexibility.
</p>
<p>7.5.2  Competitor Collaboration: Ocean Spray and Tropicana
</p>
<p>Identifying opportunities for using intermodal can be challenging. The respective 
</p>
<p>transportation services must mesh seamlessly in order to maintain service standards 
</p>
<p>and avoid delays that could result in the costly build-up of inventory. Ocean Spray 
</p>
<p>captured such an opportunity in an unconventional way: it collaborated with a 
</p>
<p>competitor.
</p>
<p>Ocean Spray is an agricultural cooperative owned by more than 700 cranberry 
</p>
<p>growers in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington, Canada, 
</p>
<p>and Chile, as well as 35 Florida grapefruit growers. The organization posted fiscal 
</p>
<p>2012 gross sales of $2.2 billion and net proceeds of $338 million.
</p>
<p>One of Ocean Sprays&rsquo; most significant logistics expenses&mdash;and a major con-
</p>
<p>tributor to its carbon footprint&mdash;was the need to ship product from its Bordentown, 
</p>
<p>New Jersey, distribution center over 1000 miles to another distribution center in 
</p>
<p>Lakeland, Florida. By coincidence, both of these distribution centers were located a 
</p>
<p>short distance (60&ndash;65 miles) from rail yards used by a competitor, Tropicana, which 
</p>
<p>shipped orange juice north from Florida in special refrigerated boxcars.
</p>
<p>Tropicana also had a key difficulty when it came to logistics. Although it could 
</p>
<p>send product direct from Florida up to the CSX rail terminal in New Jersey, once 
</p>
<p>offloaded, the refrigerated rail boxcars were often traveling empty back to Florida.
</p>
<p>Tropicana&rsquo;s third-party logistics (3PL) provider, Wheels Clipper, saw an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to help its client while earning the trust of a new customer. The company 
</p>
<p>approached Ocean Spray and proposed that they operate an intermodal lane from 
</p>
<p>New Jersey to Florida that would put Tropicana&rsquo;s empty orange juice boxcars to use 
</p>
<p>E.E. Blanco and Y. Sheffi</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>181
</p>
<p>on Ocean Spray&rsquo;s behalf. The goal was to save Ocean Spray money (and reduce 
</p>
<p>emissions) by allowing them to switch from trucking their cranberry juice to send-
</p>
<p>ing it more efficiently by rail, while also saving Tropicana the cost and emissions 
</p>
<p>associated with empty cars returning south.
</p>
<p>The plan provided environmental benefits and lowered costs for both companies. 
</p>
<p>But there were potential downsides. To make the idea work, Ocean Spray would 
</p>
<p>have to switch logistics providers and work with a new 3PL, transporting via a mode 
</p>
<p>with which the company was unfamiliar. Even more challenging, the arrangement 
</p>
<p>required Ocean Spray to collaborate with one of the company&rsquo;s strongest competi-
</p>
<p>tors in the beverage business, Tropicana.
</p>
<p>Using the intermodal solution would save Ocean Spray over 40 % in transporta-
</p>
<p>tion costs compared to the previous trucking method, and it would also reduce its 
</p>
<p>GHG emissions by a 65 %. Meanwhile, Tropicana would eliminate most of the costs 
</p>
<p>and GHG emissions of the boxcars&rsquo; return trip from its ledger&mdash;a significant reduc-
</p>
<p>tion in each metric, at the price of some (admittedly complex) process changes.
</p>
<p>Ocean Spray accepted that the plan did make sense, and the company reconfig-
</p>
<p>ured its load planning processes to make shipments compatible with the rail mode. 
</p>
<p>Tropicana and Wheels Clipper also needed to change their operating procedures to 
</p>
<p>communicate railcar availability to Ocean Spray. To guarantee the on-time delivery 
</p>
<p>of all shipments, all the participants worked to improve supply chain visibility. For 
</p>
<p>example, they improved the flow of information between the parties on the status of 
</p>
<p>shipments and potential delays. As the intermediary, Wheels Clipper helped to 
</p>
<p>ensure that this information was delivered to the relevant parties in a timely 
</p>
<p>fashion.
</p>
<p>During several pilot runs, the companies were able to coordinate load pickup and 
</p>
<p>delivery within required time windows, and to confirm that product was being han-
</p>
<p>dled properly. The trials also revealed potential problems. For example, the new 
</p>
<p>intermodal solution added 1&ndash;2 days to transit times, and Ocean Spray had to adjust 
</p>
<p>its logistics operations to avoid having a negative impact on customer service. Yet 
</p>
<p>in the end, the fact that there was a clear ROI for both shippers gave incentives to 
</p>
<p>the participants that helped them to move the project forward and make it 
</p>
<p>successful.
</p>
<p>7.5.3  Supplier Collaboration: Caterpillar and Part Suppliers
</p>
<p>Caterpillar Global Mining Division makes specialized trucks for the mining indus-
</p>
<p>try. Over the past 30 years, Caterpillar has produced nearly three times as many 
</p>
<p>trucks as its closest competitor. The company assembled its 50,000th rigid-frame 
</p>
<p>construction and mining truck in 2009.
</p>
<p>Caterpillar worked on an initiative focused on the North American inbound parts 
</p>
<p>logistics for Caterpillar&rsquo;s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Illinois. The goal was to 
</p>
<p>reduce the weight of the thousands of returnable packing containers that Caterpillar 
</p>
<p>used to transport parts from suppliers. Replacing the heavy metal packing containers 
</p>
<p>7 Green Logistics</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>182
</p>
<p>with light-weight plastic units cuts the weight of shipments, which translates into 
</p>
<p>less fuel consumption and reduced carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>However, the effort required Caterpillar to coordinate with multiple suppliers in 
</p>
<p>different countries. It was a daunting challenge, particularly when long-established 
</p>
<p>practices have to be changed. Some of these containers had been in circulation for 
</p>
<p>more than 50 years.
</p>
<p>Prior to the carbon footprint study, Caterpillar&rsquo;s internal analysis had determined 
</p>
<p>that the fuel savings from light-weighting inbound containers would be significant. 
</p>
<p>Yet Caterpillar had been slow to adopt the plastic containers because of several 
</p>
<p>internal organizational and budgetary constraints.
</p>
<p>The first step was to carry out a detailed analysis of the inbound flow of contain-
</p>
<p>ers. In partnership with MIT, Caterpillar analyzed 16 weeks of transportation data 
</p>
<p>that included detailed information about North American suppliers, number of parts 
</p>
<p>shipped, and delivery dates for three of the flagship mining trucks. The data included 
</p>
<p>more than 15,000 truck deliveries of 1400 different item numbers from more than 
</p>
<p>200 suppliers that ship directly to the Decatur manufacturing plant. The Caterpillar 
</p>
<p>and MIT teams determined that 9.5 % of shipments were eligible for light-weight 
</p>
<p>packaging.
</p>
<p>By reducing the shipping containers from 130 to 200 lb each to 20&ndash;40 lb each, 
</p>
<p>Caterpillar could reduce CO2 emissions across the Caterpillar North American net-
</p>
<p>work by 130 t. Caterpillar could now present a strong environmental case, in addi-
</p>
<p>tion to a 2-year ROI viable financial benefit to all internal and external stakeholders 
</p>
<p>affected by the packaging changes.
</p>
<p>7.5.4  The EPA SmartWay Program
</p>
<p>The SmartWay Transport Partnership is an innovative voluntary collaborative pro-
</p>
<p>gram between the EPA and the freight industry designed to improve energy effi-
</p>
<p>ciency and to lower GHG emissions and air pollution. Started in February 2004, the 
</p>
<p>partnership aims to create strong market-based incentives for companies shipping 
</p>
<p>products, and for the truck and rail companies delivering those products, to improve 
</p>
<p>the environmental performance of their freight operations.
</p>
<p>7.5.4.1  History4
</p>
<p>In 2003, staff at the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) devel-
</p>
<p>oped an initial concept to build an innovative voluntary freight transportation pro-
</p>
<p>gram focused on energy savings and emission reductions. They worked for over a 
</p>
<p>4 Based on interviews and research conducted by K. C. Tan and E. E. Blanco from the MIT Center 
for Transportation &amp; Logistics in 2009.

</p>
<p>year in collaboration with a group of public and private stakeholders to develop the 
</p>
<p>foundation of the EPA SmartWay Transport Partnership. Members of the group 
</p>
<p>included the American Trucking Association, Business for Social Responsibility, 
</p>
<p>Canon USA, Coca Cola Enterprises, CSX, FedEx, H-E-B Grocery, Home Depot, 
</p>
<p>IKEA, Interface, Nike, Norm Thompson Outfitters, Schneider National, Swift 
</p>
<p>Transportation, UPS, and YRC Worldwide.
</p>
<p>Together, these stakeholders and the EPA designed a freight transportation pro-
</p>
<p>gram that addressed the goals and needs of both the freight industry and the 
</p>
<p>EPA. The freight industry was interested in an improved public image, recognition 
</p>
<p>for its efforts, and fuel savings to help companies in an extremely competitive 
</p>
<p>industry. The EPA was interested in reducing emissions from diesel engines and 
</p>
<p>improving energy security in the freight industry. The companies provided critical 
</p>
<p>operational and technical insight into freight management and supply chain logis-
</p>
<p>tics. Their input helped the EPA to identify appropriate fuel saving technologies for 
</p>
<p>heavy trucks and to develop a fuel and emissions tracking tool that carriers and 
</p>
<p>shippers could use to track their performance.
</p>
<p>Because program enrollment was going to be on a voluntary basis, it was impor-
</p>
<p>tant to make it attractive for companies to participate and to motivate them toward a 
</p>
<p>collaborative solution in addressing energy and environmental issues in the freight 
</p>
<p>sector. After much planning, the EPA formally launched the program with the full 
</p>
<p>support of the trucking industry at the American Trucking Association&rsquo;s annual 
</p>
<p>conference on February 9, 2004, with 15 initial charter partners.
</p>
<p>7.5.4.2  Program Structure
</p>
<p>The SmartWay Transport Partnership is tailored to progressive corporations and 
</p>
<p>organizations involved in shipping goods. Companies that provide and hire freight 
</p>
<p>delivery services become SmartWay Transport Partners by committing to improve 
</p>
<p>the environmental performance of their freight delivery operations. SmartWay 
</p>
<p>Transport Carriers commit to integrate innovative cost saving strategies into their 
</p>
<p>fleet operations. SmartWay Transport Shippers commit to ship the majority of their 
</p>
<p>goods with SmartWay Transport Carriers. Companies that meet SmartWay Transport 
</p>
<p>Partnership requirements benefit from reduced operating costs and enhanced recog-
</p>
<p>nition and visibility: partners that demonstrate superior performance earn the right 
</p>
<p>to display the SmartWay Transport logo.
</p>
<p>The SmartWay program also provides technical assistance to help partners 
</p>
<p>benchmark and evaluate the effectiveness of a broad range of technology, equip-
</p>
<p>ment controls, and fuel-saving logistics management strategies. The SmartWay pro-
</p>
<p>gram has also established connections with financial institutions to provide flexible, 
</p>
<p>reduced-interest loans to improve access to these fuel-saving technologies and pol-
</p>
<p>lution controls.

<p>7.5.4.3  Impact
</p>
<p>Since 2004, SmartWay partners have eliminated over 51 million metric tons of CO2, 
</p>
<p>saved over 120 million barrels of oil and $16 billion in fuel costs, and reduced 
</p>
<p>738,000 t of NOx and 37,000 t of PM (EPA 2014).
</p>
<p>The success of SmartWay in the USA has led to its adoption in Canada, where 
</p>
<p>Natural Resources Canada now administers the program for Canadian firms, using 
</p>
<p>the same tools methods and metrics for assessing freight efficiency. In addition, the 
</p>
<p>SmartWay public&ndash;private partnership model is now being replicated in other coun-
</p>
<p>tries in Latin America, Asia, and the European Union. SmartWay is also being used 
</p>
<p>as a template to inform the development of freight sustainability programs under the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Climate Environment Program&rsquo;s and Clean Air Coalition (EPA 
</p>
<p>2014).

<p>7.6  Beyond Green Logistics
</p>
<p>This chapter has presented various levers available to improve the environmental 
</p>
<p>impact of logistics operations. Most of the approaches discussed are familiar to 
</p>
<p>logisticians: optimize distance, maximize loads, assign the right equipment and 
</p>
<p>resource, and avoid waste. These are themes that have been used for many years to 
</p>
<p>reduce cost and improve service. The same systematic approach can be used to 
</p>
<p>make logistics better for the environment.
</p>
<p>Underlying all the success stories and approaches presented throughout the 
</p>
<p>chapter&mdash;from network design, vehicle routing or multi-stakeholder collabora-
</p>
<p>tion&mdash;is the need for a solid measurement foundation of GHG, pollution, noise, and 
</p>
<p>waste impacts. Unlike financial measurements that are common and well under-
</p>
<p>stood, environmental metrics are uncertain and continuously evolving. Green logis-
</p>
<p>tics is not only about finding the optimal solution to an environmental metric, but 
</p>
<p>also to make sure that traditional strategies are reviewed with environmental lenses. 
</p>
<p>New trade-offs may be uncovered, as well as new sources of value and cost 
</p>
<p>reduction.
</p>
<p>This chapter uses a narrow scope&mdash;just logistics activities&mdash;for all analyses of 
</p>
<p>impacts and strategies for improving. In transport sustainability some cases, a 
</p>
<p>broader scope of analysis, such as an end-to-end life-cycle analysis, will reveal 
</p>
<p>trade-offs between the greenest choices in logistics and greenest choices in sourc-
</p>
<p>ing, manufacturing, returns, product design, and so forth. For example, differences 
</p>
<p>in manufacturing efficiencies or the energy portfolios of different regions may mean 
</p>
<p>that higher impacts in transportation permit much lower environmental impacts 
</p>
<p>overall. Or, a slower mode of transport might reduce transportation emissions but 
</p>
<p>increase the amount of waste due to spoilage, obsolescence, or excessive 
</p>
<p>inventory.
</p>
<p>E.E. Blanco and Y. Sheffi</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>185
</p>
<p>Thus, the analyses and strategies in this chapter are an element of a broader 
</p>
<p>process of analyzing and improving the sustainability of the business or supply 
</p>
<p>chain at a more holistic level. As a consequence, there are more opportunities 
</p>
<p>related to green logistics. Reverse logistics and closed loop supply chains (see 
</p>
<p>Chap. 17 by Abbey and Guide (2017)) adds a new dimension to managing waste 
</p>
<p>by focusing on how to recover products delivered to customers and extract new 
</p>
<p>sources of value. Technological improvements that completely avoid emissions, 
</p>
<p>such as solar energy, could completely avoid the need to reconfigure logistics net-
</p>
<p>works. Advances in nanomaterials and biodegradable materials may make packag-
</p>
<p>ing waste a nonissue. And, in some cases, life-cycle thinking may challenge 
</p>
<p>logistics operations to increase their impact to allow for a holistic reduction of the 
</p>
<p>environmental impact of products: it may be sometimes better to import a product 
</p>
<p>from the other side of the world if energy sources are cleaner there than to manu-
</p>
<p>facture it locally.
</p>
<p>A new generation of green logistics choices is quickly unfolding, and the con-
</p>
<p>cepts discussed in this chapter provide a foundation for the journey ahead.

<p>8.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>Managing inventories and thereby controlling the material flows through a facility, or 
network of facilities, is a matter of key importance in achieving efficient supply 
chains. Core issues in traditional inventory management are how much to order when 
and where to satisfy the customers&rsquo; service needs at minimum cost? In this context, 
reasons for keeping inventory are economies of scale in batch ordering/production, 
and/or uncertainties in demand and supply. However, inventory management may also 
involve strategic decisions regarding design of distribution and production networks, 
facility location, procurement, supplier selection, choice of product range, etc. Many 
of these strategic issues are treated thoroughly in other chapters of this book, and will 
not be further discussed in this chapter. Instead, we will focus on the core operational 
issues and define inventory management in line with the operations research and man-
agement science (OR/MS) literature on inventory control and inventory modeling. It 
should be noted that closed loop systems encompassing reverse logistics flows, which 
is part of this literature, are treated separately in Chap. 17 by Abbey and Guide (2017).
</p>
<p>In green (or sustainable) inventory management, the pure economic focus (tradi-
tionally measured in terms of costs) is complemented with an environmental per-
spective (typically measured in terms of emissions). This means that potential 
trade-offs need to be identified and resolved. Thus, green inventory management in 
the context of this chapter is concerned with the overarching question of how to

<p>efficiently manage inventories (and thereby material flows) with respect to both 
costs and emissions. An important insight is that inventory decisions are interlinked 
with production and transportation decisions that directly influence emissions. 
A total cost and emissions perspective is therefore important in green inventory 
management to avoid suboptimization and achieve cost-efficient emission reduc-
tions. Crudely speaking, emissions are often divided into three categories: Green 
House Gases (GHG), other harmful gases, and particles. Among these, GHG emis-
sions (for convenience often measured in CO2 equivalents) are getting most of the 
attention in media, and society at large, because of its impact on global warming. 
This is also reflected in the OR/MS literature on green inventory management and 
in the contents of this chapter. (Chap. 3 by Boukherroub et al. (2017) focuses 
entirely on carbon footprinting.) However, it is important not to forget that environ-
mental consequences are not limited to (GHG) emissions and may, for example, 
include: noise, accidents, waste product accumulation in landfills and oceans, 
chemicals that pollute our air, ground, and water supply, deforestation and exploita-
tion of natural resources that damage our ecological systems, etc. (Chap. 2 by 
Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs (2017) introduces LCA and, in doing so, a full spectrum of 
environmental impact categories.)
</p>
<p>Looking at how inventory management decisions may influence emissions, we 
first note that emissions are associated with energy consumption. Thus, decisions 
that affect the energy consumption of the supply chain will influence its emissions. 
With this in mind one may divide the emissions associated with operating an 
 inventory system into three categories: emissions associated with ordering (i.e., 
producing and transporting) items, emissions associated with holding items in 
stock, and emissions associated with not satisfying customer demand on time. Note 
that this partition mirrors the cost components usually considered in inventory man-
agement: costs for ordering/procuring items, costs for holding items in stock, and 
shortage costs for not satisfying customer demands on time.
</p>
<p>In the remainder of this introduction, we will take a closer look at these three 
categories of emissions and costs and use them as a basis for identifying key ques-
tions and challenges for green inventory management research. Basic inventory 
modeling structures, assumptions, and issues are also discussed. This is followed by 
an overview of the existing green inventory management literature in Sects. 8.2 and 
8.3, which illustrate what issues and challenges have been addressed in the  literature 
so far, and how. Section 8.2 considers deterministic demand models and Sect. 8.3 
stochastic demand models. We also distinguish between single-echelon and multi-
echelon inventory systems. Section 8.4 concludes with remarks about findings, 
practical implications, and what remains to be done in.
</p>
<p>8.1.1  Emissions and Costs Associated with Ordering Items
</p>
<p>The decision of when and how much to order is intricately connected to the issue of 
how ordered items should be produced and/or transported. For example, larger lot 
(or order) sizes in manufacturing, especially in energy-intensive process industries,

<p>may have a significant impact on the energy use and emissions. However, it also 
leads to more finished goods and work in process inventory. The importance of 
transportation from an emissions point of view is apparent. For example, by 
 choosing a greener transport mode such as sea or rail instead of road or air, the 
transport emissions, and generally also the transportation costs, can be reduced. 
Similarly, by employing shipment consolidation strategies and shipping full truck-
loads and containers less frequently, the transportation capacity is better utilized. 
This means fewer vehicles are needed to ship the same volume suggesting less 
transportation emissions, and typically lower transportation costs for operating the 
system. The problem is that these strategies, which appear attractive when transpor-
tation is considered in isolation, can have negative consequences for the system as a 
whole. For example, greener transportation modes are generally slower, and often 
associated with larger fixed costs, suggesting longer transportation lead times and 
larger order sizes/shipment quantities. This means more inventory, and thereby 
increasing costs and emissions for holding inventory. Similarly, shipment consoli-
dation suggests larger, less frequent, and/or less flexible shipments, and thereby 
more inventories. It is also noteworthy that these strategies are at odds with general 
perceptions of Just In Time (JIT) and LEAN, where frequent shipments of small 
batches are often implied.
</p>
<p>8.1.2  Emissions and Costs Associated with Holding Items 
</p>
<p>in Stock
</p>
<p>The fact that there are costs of holding items in stock is undisputed. How these costs 
should be determined in practice is often more of an issue. The norm is to assume 
that they are proportional to the number of items in stock. (As some of the cost 
components usually are fixed, or tend to increase stepwise with the number of units 
in stock, the appropriateness of assuming linear holding costs may sometimes be 
questioned). The holding cost per unit and time unit can be divided into two main 
components: cost of capital, and out-of-pocket holding costs. The former is gener-
ally determined as a holding cost rate multiplied by the monetary value of the item. 
It should reflect the opportunity cost of tying up capital in inventory instead of in 
other investment opportunities. Conversely, the out-of-pocket holding cost rate 
should reflect the costs of operating the inventory facilities (including energy costs), 
handling the items, and loosing items because they perish, are stolen, destroyed in 
accidents, misplaced, etc. The emissions associated with holding items in stock are 
clearly connected to the energy consumption of operating the inventory facilities 
and handling the items, but also to items that are discarded and wasted. An impor-
tant example of the latter is food (often with high CO2 content) that perishes and is 
thrown away. For instance, the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology (SIK) 
2011, reports that roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption 
is lost or wasted globally. Furthermore, in high income countries, one of the main 
reasons for the waste is lack of coordination between demand and supply. For more 
in-depth discussions of challenges and issues in sustainable food supply chain

<p>design, we refer to Chap. 18 by Bloemhof and Soysal (2017). Another less obvious 
emission source can be leakage of pollutants. As an example, Walmart states that 
leakage of highly potent GHG refrigerants account for 13 % of their total GHG 
footprint, which is almost twice as much as what the fuel to their trucks account for 
(Walmart Global Responsibility Report 2013). This emphasizes the fact that the 
emissions of operating inventory facilities and stock handling is case dependent, 
and very much affected by the type of products considered. If a temperature- 
controlled environment is needed, as is the case for frozen or refrigerated products, 
the energy consumption and thereby emissions of holding items in stock are much 
higher and more important to consider than if items are stored in a non-heated ware-
house or outdoors. Another example, in contrast to refrigerated products, is that 
many chemical companies, such as Eastman, at least for limited periods, store prod-
ucts in molten form, which requires a lot of energy.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, more inventories suggest increased costs and emissions, 
although exactly how and to what extent is often more difficult to say without a 
careful analysis. Assuming a proportional relationship, which is often done, is con-
venient, but may not always be appropriate. Relating inventory holding costs and 
emissions to the strategies for reducing production and/or transport emissions and 
costs above (e.g., use of greener transport modes, and shipment consolidation) illus-
trates important trade-offs. Reducing transport emissions and costs may lead to 
more inventory suggesting increased emissions and costs for holding items in stock. 
Resolving trade-offs like this to minimize total costs and emissions for the system 
is a key challenge in green (or sustainable) inventory management.
</p>
<p>8.1.3  Emissions and Costs Associated with Not Satisfying 
</p>
<p>Customer Demand on Time
</p>
<p>The purpose of the inventory system is to provide adequate service to its customers. 
Not satisfying customer demands on time have negative impact on the customers as 
they are not receiving the service they expect. This negative impact can be translated 
into shortage costs for the inventory system. The shortage cost may be a fixed cost 
per shortage or it may be dependent on the time a customer has to wait for an item 
(it is then often referred to as a backorder cost). The shortage cost can reflect con-
crete monetary reimbursements or price discounts in case of delayed deliveries. It 
should also reflect loss of goodwill in terms of foregone future sales and revenues. 
Some shortage cost components may be relatively easy to determine, such as down-
time costs in a machine or in a production facility. Other shortage cost components, 
such as loss of goodwill and future revenues, are more difficult to ascertain. These 
difficulties explain why service (level) constraints are more popular in practice than 
shortage costs. On the other hand, shortage costs are the preferred choice in the 
research literature as measuring all performance aspects in monetary terms enables 
a total cost perspective. Thus making it less ambiguous to compare the performance 
of different policies where the exact same service cannot be achieved.

</p>
<p>The negative consequences of not satisfying customer demands on time may 
also involve increased emissions. For example, consider a dairy where a machine 
breakdown halts the production process. If the necessary spare part is not avail-
able within hours, the semi-finished milk products in the process must be dis-
carded, and the facility needs to be cleaned before it can be restarted. Clearly, the 
emissions associated with throwing away a production batch of dairy products, 
and steam- cleaning the process facility are significant. Another example of emis-
sions associated with not satisfying customer demand on time is the transport 
emissions of a customer making an extra trip, e.g., to IKEA, because the product 
was stocked out when she initially went there to buy it. In situations like this when 
poor service generates emissions at a firm&rsquo;s customer (Scope 3 emissions) there is 
a problem of how to allocate the emissions between the two parties. The problem 
is especially difficult if the customer, as in the IKEA example, has a choice to 
make the extra trip or not. Emission allocation issues are briefly discussed in 
Chap. 3 (Boukherroub et al. 2017). A common situation not complicated by emis-
sion allocation issues between the firm and its customers is when the firm uses 
emergency shipments to deal with inventory shortages. The extra transportation 
emissions for these emergency shipments may be interpreted as emissions for not 
satisfying customer demand on time through the regular inventory system. The 
emergency shipments are often associated with higher emissions than regular 
deliveries due to lower load efficiency in vehicles and use of faster, more energy 
intensive, transportation modes.
</p>
<p>Similarly to shortage costs, the emissions associated with not satisfying cus-
tomer demand on time can be more or less difficult to determine: In the dairy exam-
ple above and in terms of emergency shipments, it is relatively straightforward 
although not without practical challenges. However, in the IKEA example it is more 
difficult as the second trip to IKEA in some cases would have been made anyway 
because the customer was going there to buy other products. Also, the length of the 
trip, and thereby the emissions, are different across customers, making it difficult to 
estimate. Although the emissions and costs associated with not satisfying customer 
demand on time are sometimes challenging to determine, they can be very impor-
tant to consider in green inventory management. Returning to the dairy example 
above, which stems from a real case, the spare parts provider initially had the ambi-
tion to eliminate air freight, and switch to road and sea freight to reduce transport 
emissions. However, after further analysis, they concluded that these reductions 
were minute in comparison to the increased risk of not delivering spare parts fast 
enough to avoid production losses.
</p>
<p>From the discussion above we can conclude that key challenges in green 
inventory management are to understand how a decision impacts the costs and 
emissions for the inventory system, and how to leverage this understanding to 
make the &ldquo;best&rdquo; decisions. The overarching goal is to minimize both costs and 
emissions, but decisions that minimize the system&rsquo;s costs rarely minimize its 
emissions and vice versa. Thus a key question is how these potentially conflict-
ing objectives may be reconciled, or in other words, to define what &ldquo;best&rdquo; deci-
sions means in different contexts. The main approaches used are to: (1) translate

</p>
<p>emissions into  environmental costs and minimize the total costs, (2) minimize 
the costs while restricting the total emissions to not exceed a given maximum 
value or cap, (3) minimize the costs under an emissions cap that can be traded on 
a market, and (4) use Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to 
combine the emission and cost perspectives. The latter may involve identifying 
efficient frontiers, Pareto optimal solutions, construction of utility functions etc. 
The former three reflects a hierarchical view where the main goal is cost minimi-
zation. From a company perspective, emission restrictions and environmental 
costs can reflect regulations and taxes imposed by society, or it may be based on 
voluntary commitments. Another form of the latter is investing in different types 
of carbon offsets (e.g., planting of trees).
</p>
<p>An aspect worth noting is that depending on how the supply chained is orga-
nized, the types of emissions discussed above may (according to the GHG proto-
col) belong to Scope 1 (direct emissions, e.g., from company owned vehicles), 
Scope 2 (indirect emissions from electricity, heating, cooling, etc. purchased by 
the company) or Scope 3 (other indirect emissions, e.g., from customers and out-
sourced services, including transportation and warehousing). As outsourcing is 
very common in logistics (for example, companies today rarely have their own 
private transportation fleet), the Scope 3 emissions are significant. The challenges 
of measuring and allocating (Scope 3) emissions in supply chains are thoroughly 
discussed in Chap. 3 (Boukherroub et al. 2017) and will not be further discussed 
in this chapter.
</p>
<p>Considering the relative size of the emissions discussed above, emissions for 
producing and transporting items are in general much larger than those for holding 
items in stock. For instance, the World Economic Forum (2009) estimates that 
about 90 % of the emissions (measured in CO2 equivalents) for logistics and trans-
port activities are due to freight transportation, and 10 % for operating logistics 
buildings. (Emissions associated with production, or not satisfying the customer on 
time, are not discussed in this report, which focuses on emission sources in logistics 
and transportation from a macroperspective). Moreover, the energy demand for 
freight transport is expected to continue to increase because of the globalization of 
trade and supply chains. The European Commission (2009) estimates a 60 % 
increase in this energy demand from 1990 to 2030 (1990&ndash;2009 the observed 
increase was 36 %). Thus from a climate perspective, reducing transport emissions 
is important. An obvious step in this direction is development of cleaner vehicle 
technologies, but the World Economic Forum (2009) also emphasizes several other 
important strategies including: despeeding the supply chain, optimizing transport 
networks, and switching of transport modes to greener alternatives. Important 
enablers for despeeding the supply chain, without significant cost increases due to 
prolonged lead times, are improved collaboration and information sharing between 
suppliers, customers, and other parties in the supply chain. With respect to opti-
mized networks, the Word Economic Forum estimate that 24 % of the goods vehicle 
kilometers in the EU are associated with empty vehicles, and when carrying a load, 
vehicles are on average filled to 57 % of their maximum gross weight. Altogether 
this indicates a large potential for increasing the capacity utilization of vehicles, for

</p>
<p>example, through better shipment consolidation and multimodal transport solutions. 
From an inventory management perspective, all these strategies for greener trans-
ports (except perhaps cleaner vehicle technologies) suggests longer lead times, and 
thereby a need for more inventory, or a decline in customer service. Thus an impor-
tant question in green inventory management is how to enable reduction in transport 
emissions without compromising customer service or increasing total costs and 
emissions. Here, green (or sustainable) management of multi-echelon (or multi-
stage) inventory systems, with inventories upstream and downstream in the supply 
chain that jointly can compensate for lead time changes, offers interesting 
opportunities.
</p>
<p>From a modeling perspective, the added complexity in green inventory manage-
ment, compared to traditional cost-based inventory models, is to quantify also the 
emissions (or environmental consequences), and to find optimal decisions with 
respect to both costs and emissions. An important first step is then to be able to 
evaluate the expected emissions and costs associated with a decision. We note that 
in cases where the emissions accumulate in the same way as the costs, the expected 
costs and the expected emissions may be evaluated using the same method. Thus, 
if a traditional inventory management model already exists for evaluating the 
expected costs, the same model can be used also for determining the expected 
emissions. The remaining challenge is then to find the best joint decisions with 
regard to costs and emissions. Of course, if the emission and cost components can-
not be modelled analogously, new evaluation methods are needed. Thus, an impor-
tant question for green (or sustainable) inventory management modeling is to what 
extent it may be built on existing results. The fact that it requires careful balancing 
of costs against emissions emphasizes a need for precise models and evaluation 
methods in both dimensions. This means that traditional approximations and model 
assumptions, not least regarding costs, should be carefully analyzed before they are 
used.
</p>
<p>8.2  Green Inventory Management Under Deterministic 
</p>
<p>Demand
</p>
<p>This section provides an overview of green inventory models that are based on the 
assumption that future demand is known with certainty. Such an assumption of 
deterministic demand can be appropriate in some situations, but clearly most often, 
future demand is uncertain. Still, deterministic models are often used with good 
results as heuristics for determining order quantities (or lot sizes) also when the 
demand is stochastic. Disregarding demand uncertainties simplifies the analysis. It 
is therefore a natural starting point for gaining some first insights of the cost and 
emission trade-offs that exist in green inventory management. An important aspect 
of this is the impact of different mechanisms for reducing emissions used by policy 
makers. Most of the literature on sustainable inventory control with deterministic 
demand is based on the well-known economic order quantity (EOQ) model for lot

</p>
<p>sizing published already in 1913 by Ford W. Harris, (Harris 1913). We first present 
some of these results and then discuss some more elaborate models that extend and 
confirm the main insights gained from the simpler EOQ-models.
</p>
<p>8.2.1  The Single-Echelon EOQ-Model with Environmental 
</p>
<p>Considerations
</p>
<p>The traditional EOQ-model considers a single inventory location and a single 
product with a constant and continuous demand D per time unit. The lead-time is 
zero and no backorders or lost sales are allowed so each time the inventory level 
goes to zero a new order is placed. Stock keeping in this simple setting is moti-
vated by economies of scale in batch ordering/production as reflected by the fixed 
cost per order. The aim is to minimize the average cost per time unit of ordering 
and keeping this product in stock. Extensions to discrete demand, a positive lead-
time, planned backorders, and a volume-based price per unit are straightforward 
(see, for example, Axs&auml;ter 2006), but will not be further discussed in this 
chapter.
</p>
<p>Each time an order is placed in the EOQ-model, the firm incurs a fixed cost A per 
order and a variable cost c per unit purchased. The cost for an order of Q units is

<p>Emissions are incorporated into the model using an emissions structure that mir-
rors the cost structure. To do so we introduce the emission parameters &Acirc;, ĉ and ĥ 
denoting the emission per placed order, per unit ordered, and per unit kept in stock 
for one unit of time. The average emissions per time unit, E(Q), can then be 
expressed as

<p>It follows that a reduction in emissions by adjusting the order quantity from the 
cost-minimizing solution can only be attained if the relationship

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Note that if a = 1 , the two solutions, Q*Z and Q*E, will coincide. In all other cases, 
i.e., a &sup1; 1 , a reduction in emissions implies a deviation from the cost-minimizing 
order quantity, Q*Z, and thus an increase in cost. The best ordering decision from a 
joint emission and cost perspective is the one that gives the lowest cost for a given 
amount of emission or vice versa, i.e., a solution that belongs to the efficient 
 cost- emission frontier as depicted in Fig. 8.1. The properties of this frontier for the 
classical EOQ-problem are analyzed and discussed in Bouchery et al. (2012). Key 
results, illustrated in Fig. 8.1, are that the efficient frontier is convex, and that sub-
stantial emission reductions can be attained with only a modest increase in cost 
when the cost is close to optimal. The opposite holds when the inventory-related 
cost is far from optimal, that is, a large increase in cost is needed to attain a small 
emission reduction.
</p>
<p>The behavior can be explained by the well-established fact that for the classic 
EOQ-problem, the total cost is fairly insensitive to changes in the order quantity 
around its optimum Q*Z. Conversely, the total cost is highly sensitive to such changes

<p>As mentioned earlier, Multiple Criteria Decision Making techniques based on 
efficient frontier analyses and/or formulas as the ones above is one of several 
approaches used for combining emission and cost considerations in green inventory 
management. The other approaches, i.e., to translate the emission into an environ-
mental cost (for example, in terms of an imposed carbon tax), to use an emission 
constraint with a fixed cap, or to operate under cap and trade or cap and offset sys-
tems, have all been studied in the literature on green EOQ-problems, for example, 
in Chen et al. (2013) and Hua et al. (2011). These findings are summarized below.

<p>Comparing this cost expression with the one where an emission tax is applied, 
Z&prime;t(Q), we can see that they are indeed very similar. The difference is that the price 
for emissions, p, has replaced the tax rate, t, and that an adjustment, pC&prime;, is made as 
one only pays for the emissions in excess of the cap. Consequently, the optimal 
solution is also similar

<p>In fact, the EOQ-model with an emission tax, can be viewed as a special case of the 
same model with a cap and trade mechanism, with the cap set to zero, and price of 
emission rights, p, set to the tax rate t. A major difference between a cap and trade 
system and tax system (also when p t= ) is that the former implies less of a cost 
increase for the firms (except when C &cent; = 0 ) as one gets a reimbursement equal to 
pC&prime;. For some firms the revenue from selling emission rights might even exceed 
their increase in inventory-related cost. This means they are better off under a cap 
and trade system than without any regulations.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, from the expression for Q*C &amp;T(p) we can see that there is no direct 
connection between the cap, C, and the optimal inventory policy. There should be 
an indirect connection though, as reduced caps imply an increased demand for 
emission rights. This should increase the price p and push Q*C &amp;T(p) towards the 
emission minimizing order quantity, Q*E. Some companies will benefit from a gen-
eral reduction of the cap whereas others will lose money.

emission rights, p, and selling price of zero. Any cap and trade system with a differ-
ence in buying and selling price of emission rights will exhibit similar structure. 
Albeit with seven possible order quantities as emission rights will be sold if the 
optimal order quantity when doing so falls between QL(C&prime;) and Q*C &amp;T(p), or QU(C&prime;)

</p>
<p>Several authors, Battini et al. (2014), Bozorgi et al. (2014), and Konur and 
Schaefer (2014) consider non-linear (stepwise increasing) ordering costs and emis-
sions to capture the limited capacity of trucks and similar transportation resources. 
Problems with non-linear ordering cost are not new but one can argue that they are 
of particular interest for environmental considerations as much of the transport 
emissions are due to the movement of the actual vehicle. Konur (2014) elaborates 
further on this problem by integrating the design of the transportation fleet into the 
inventory management decisions.
</p>
<p>Toptal et al. (2014) consider the EOQ-model where there exists an alternative 
emission-reducing investment. In a cap and trade system, the optimal order quan-
tity is still Q*C &amp;T(p). The reason is that an emission reduction leads to the same 
saving or revenue no matter how it is achieved. In contrast, in a system with a 
fixed cap, the optimal ordering quantity and the alternative emission-reducing 
investment will be interdependent. To achieve an emission reduction, an

<p>202
</p>
<p> adjustment of the order quantity will always be made. The alternative emission-
reducing investment is used as a complement if the reduction required to reach 
the cap is substantial.
</p>
<p>Inventory problems with deterministic non-stationary demand are considered in 
Benjaafar et al. (2013), Absi et al. (2013) and Helmrich et al. (2015) among others. 
Benjaafar et al. (2013) make a number of observations based on a series of numeri-
cal experiments that are in line with what can be deduced directly from the EOQ-
model discussed above. In addition they point to the fact that if the emission cap is 
not based on the long-run average but is imposed on a given period, then a tighter 
cap might lead to higher total emissions (something that applies to the problem with 
stationary demand as well).
</p>
<p>The literature on green inventory control in a multi-echelon setting with deter-
ministic demand is more limited. Bouchery et al. (2012) extend the analysis of the 
efficient cost-emission frontier to a two stage serial system. For a single criteria 
problem, the optimal policy is a stationary nested policy, i.e., the higher echelon 
always order an integer multiple k of the lower echelon&rsquo;s order quantity. For a 
multi-criteria problem, the optimal policy is still nested but not necessarily station-
ary. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.2 that shows the frontier for the best combined policy 
as well as the efficient frontier of a number of stationary-nested policies.
</p>
<p>The analysis in Bouchery et al. (2012) focuses on stationary policies arguing 
that such policies are easier to implement in practice. In the non-convex segments 
of the frontier of stationary policies, a better solution can be obtained using a linear 
combination of two nested policies, represented by the dotted straight line in 
Fig. 8.2. This renders the true cost/emission frontier. Thus, in contrast to a single-
echelon system, the optimal policy in a serial system is not necessarily stationary 
even under constant demand.

<p>Benjaafar et al. (2013) investigates the cost benefit of collaborating in a supply 
chain in order to meet emission caps. They show numerically that the relative ben-
efits can be substantial, particularly for mid-range emission caps. When the cap is 
high, it has little influence on the supply chain. If the cap is low, the cost for the 
supply chain to adhere to it will be very high, and the relative savings of collaborat-
ing to meet the cap will be low, even if they might be high in absolute values. They 
also show that as always, it is important that the benefits of collaboration are not 
distributed in a too unfair manner. If they are, some parties might prefer to not col-
laborate as this will increase their costs, even if the total cost for the supply chain 
decreases. Wahab et al. (2011) investigate supply-chain collaboration in an EOQ- 
setting considering imperfect items and environmental impact. The latter is cap-
tured as a tax on emissions, and they assume that there are no emissions linked to 
holding inventory. Their numerical examples show a reduction of the order-quantity 
when environmental considerations are taken. With a larger amount of emissions 
linked to holding inventory, the results could, of course, be reversed.

<p>8.3  Green Inventory Management Under Stochastic Demand
</p>
<p>In this section we extend the scope to green inventory management models that deals 
with demand uncertainty. In these models, the demand is represented by stochastic (or 
random) variables with known probability distributions. A stochastic variable can have 
many different outcomes, and the probability (or density, if it is a continuous variable) 
for each outcome is specified in a probability distribution. In practice, demand is almost 
always uncertain, and arguably one of the main reasons for stock keeping in practice is 
to buffer against this uncertainty, and maintain acceptable customer service. The impor-
tance of stochastic demand models in inventory management is therefore undisputed. In 
the following, we will consider a range of green inventory models available in the litera-
ture to illustrate and explain how the different challenges and trade-offs discussed in the 
beginning of this chapter are considered. We first focus on single-echelon models and 
then extend the scope to multi-echelon models involving networks of inventory loca-
tions. (We assume the locations as given; in Chap. 9, Vel&aacute;squez Mart&iacute;nez and Fransoo 
examine green facility location.) For reasons of space, some models are treated more 
briefly than others. This does not mean that they are less important or interesting. 
Mathematical details of more complex models are omitted.

<p>season) and may be appropriate for seasonal goods, fashion clothing, and high tech 
products with very short lifecycles. Our exposur&eacute; begins by considering green inventory 
management in newsvendor settings. The scope is then extended to more general inven-
tory management situations with multiple periods and replenishment opportunities.
</p>
<p>8.3.1.1  Green Inventory Management in Newsvendor Settings
</p>
<p>The classical newsvendor model assumes that the demand during the selling period 
is stochastic, and at the end of the period there are overage (holding) costs associ-
ated with every unsold unit, and underage (shortage) costs associated with every 
unsatisfied demand. The focus is on the inventory management decision of how 
many units to order for the coming period, when the objective is to minimize the 
expected overage (holding) and underage (shortage) costs. An alternative objective 
is to maximize the expected profit for the considered period by also taking purchase 
and selling prices per unit into consideration.
</p>
<p>To illustrate how the newsvendor framework can be used for green inventory man-
agement, we consider a dual sourcing model analyzed in Rosič and Jammernegg 
(2013), and Arıkan and Jammernegg (2014). Together these two papers consider 
costs and emissions associated with ordering, producing, and transporting items and 
with holding items in stock. They also consider different types of emission regula-
tions and emission constraints for a profit maximizing firm. More precisely, Rosič 
and Jammernegg (2013) investigate the economic and environmental impact of dual 
sourcing for three scenarios of emission regulations: (1) no regulations, (2) an emis-
sion (or carbon) tax and (3) a cap and trade system with fixed price emission allow-
ances. In their model a profit maximizing firm has the option to source from a 
low-cost offshore supplier before a given selling season starts, or to use a more 
expensive, fast, onshore supplier, when demand has been realized at the end of the 
selling season. Transporting goods from the offshore supplier is associated with 
transport emissions, while transport emissions from the onshore supplier are negli-
gible. During the selling season there is a stochastic demand for X units, and the firm 
sells the product at unit price p. Unsold products (in inventory) at the end of the 
season has a per unit salvage value z, which includes the inventory holding costs. The 
firm procures q units from the offshore supplier at the unit price c before the season 
starts, and the rest from the onshore supplier at unit price c + d at the end of the season 
when the demand is known. It is assumed that p &gt; c &gt; z, and p &gt; c + d so that the onshore 
supplier is an option to consider. Thus, if a demand of x units is realized max(x &minus; q, 
0) = (x &minus; q)+ units are purchased from the onshore supplier. This corresponds to the 
underage or lost sales in the classical newsvendor model. Moreover, the underage 
cost is d, the overage cost is c &minus; z, and the firm&rsquo;s profit function, given q and x, is

<p>Introducing a transportation emission tax, t, per unit shipped from the offshore sup-

profit.

<p>As an alternative to the linear emission tax, the authors also consider an emissions 
trading system, where the company, free of charge, receives emission allowances 
corresponding to an emission cap of L products transported from the offshore sup-
plier. The firm can buy more emission allowances at the per unit price b, and sell 
allowances it does not use at the per unit price s (b &ge; s). This means that the transport 
emission costs are b(q &minus; L)+, the revenue of selling unused emission allowances is 
s(L &minus; q)+, and the expected profit for emission cap L and offshore order quantity q is:

<p>Note that b &ge; s implies that qb &le; qs, and that s = b = 0 brings us back to the basic dual 
sourcing model without emission regulations. Moreover, L = 0 and b = t renders the 
emission tax model.
</p>
<p>From the above expressions one can conclude that qL &lt; q*, meaning that the off-
shore order quantity, and thereby the emissions are reduced through the emission 
trading system. One can also see that the smallest offshore order quantity under the 
emission trading system is qb. Thus, setting the cap, L, lower than this will not 
reduce the transport emissions further it will only decrease the firm&rsquo;s profit.
</p>
<p>In a numerical study based on normally distributed demand, the authors illus-
trate that dual sourcing as described in this stylized model can reduce emissions 
and improve economic performance in comparison to single sourcing from an 
offshore supplier. By implementing environmental regulations in terms of a lin-
ear transport emission tax or a cap and trade system, the transport emissions can 
be further reduced. Both an emission tax and a cap and trade system are in the 
context of this model very effective tools to reduce emissions, but the emission 
tax tend to affect the firm&rsquo;s profit more severely. Under the cap and trade system 
profits can even increase, as the firm may generate extra revenues by selling 
emission allowances it has received for free but do not need. These results indi-
cate that from the firm&rsquo;s perspective a cap and trade system is preferred over an 
emission tax.
</p>
<p>Arıkan and Jammernegg (2014) consider the same dual sourcing model, but 
when a Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) constraint, set voluntarily or by regulators, 
is used to limit the emissions. Hence, the management objective is to maximize the 
profit, P(q), subject to the PCF constraint. The carbon footprint may be used for 
differentiating the firm&rsquo;s products, for example, by displaying it on an eco-label. 
The emissions considered in the model are production, transportation, and ware-
housing activities. Emissions caused customers by usage and consumption are 
excluded. The emissions related to holding items in stock (overage), including dis-
posal of products or shipping them to secondary markets, etc. are modelled explic-
itly by use of eL, the per unit emissions for surplus inventory at the end of the period. 
Similarly, the target emissions per unit is denoted e, the per unit emissions from the 
first (offshore) and second supply options are denoted e1 and e2, respectively. Let 
L(q) denote the expected overage given the offshore order quantity q, and Q(q) the 
expected underage.

<p>Note that the model now considers emissions both from the first supply option, (the 
offshore supplier), the second supply option (which may be an onshore supplier), 
and from items in stock at the end of the selling period. The latter includes disposal 
of the unsold products.
</p>
<p>The inventory management problem is to maximize the expected profit P(q), 
defined as above, subject to the PCF constraint, E(q) &le; B(q), where B(q) = e(q + Q(q)). 
Note that this PCF constraint concerns the expected emissions, and that the upper 
bound B(q) is linear in the total order quantity (q + Q(q)) which corresponds to the 
total demand. (An alternative, for example, used in Song and Leng (2012) is to set 
a constant upper bound on the emissions independent of q, say, B. This is then 
analogous to a capacity constraint.) Under reasonable parameter values it is shown 
that the optimal offshore order quantity under the PCF constraint, qCF is

<p>The lower and upper control limits, q ql l1 2&lt; , define the feasible region, and are 
obtained as the intersection points of E(q) and B(q). Note however that the lower 
limit ql1 might be non-existing, for example, if the condition e1 &le; e &le; e2 is not ful-
filled. Recall that q* = F&minus;1(d/(d + c &minus; z)) is the unconstrained optimum to max P(q) 
defined above.
</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, Arıkan and Jammernegg (2014) consider two situations 
for the second supply option; (i) an environmentally friendly but expensive onshore 
supplier (similar to Rosič and Jammernegg (2013) above) and (ii) a fast emergency 
transport option from the offshore supplier. The onshore supplier is characterized 
by lower per unit emissions than the offshore alternative (motivated by less trans-
port emissions), i.e., e2 &lt; e1. Conversely, fast emergency shipments from the off-
shore supplier suggests higher per unit emissions (and costs) than its regular 
shipments (e.g., air vs. sea) with e2 &gt; e1.
</p>
<p>For the onshore option with qCF = min{q*, ql2}, one can conclude that qCF decreases 
if the per unit emissions e1, e2, or eL increases, or if e (the per unit emission target) 
decreases. Thus, if the per unit emissions increase, or if a tougher emission target is 
introduced, the firm buys less from the offshore supplier, and more from the envi-
ronmentally friendly onshore supplier. Recall that the model presumes that all 
demand is satisfied.
</p>
<p>For the fast emergency transport option from the offshore supplier, the behavior 
of qCF with respect to e1, e2, eL, and e is the same as long as e2 is smaller than e (i.e., 
the per unit emissions for emergency shipments are below the per unit target). In 
case e2 &gt; e, the behavior depends on the critical ratio d/(d + c &minus; z), and qCF may either 
decrease or increase.

<p/>

</p>
<p>From a numerical study the authors make a number of observations about trade- offs 
between the sourcing options, costs, and emissions. For example, within large ranges 
of the emission and cost parameters, the alternative with an onshore supplier offers 
significant reductions in emissions with only small reductions in expected profits. 
Moreover, if the onshore option offers lower per unit costs than the emergency ship-
ment option, it is better both from environmental and economic perspectives. On the 
other hand, if the per unit cost for the onshore option is much higher than for the emer-
gency shipment option, onshoring may lead to both higher costs and emissions. The 
latter is due to the model requirement of satisfying all demands. To avoid using the 
expensive onshore option (which must be used if there are shortages) qCF is increased 
significantly, which leads to more emissions for producing and transporting (e1qCF), but 
also for handling and disposing of more units that are left over in inventory (eLL(qCF)).
</p>
<p>Other green inventory management literature based on the newsvendor frame-
work includes Song and Leng (2012). They consider the classical newsvendor 
model under three types of carbon emission regulations; a mandatory carbon emis-
sion constraint, a linear carbon emissions tax, and a cap and trade system.
</p>
<p>Choi and Chiu (2012) consider a newsvendor model for a risk averse fashion 
retailer where any items in stock at the end of the selling period is obsolete and 
wasted. They establish mean-variance (MR), and mean-downside risk (MDR) mod-
els and compare their levels of sustainability to the classical risk neutral retailer, 
which maximizes the expected profit. The considered measures of sustainability 
are: expected number of unsold items in stock, expected sales to expected overage 
ratio, rate of return on investment, and the probability of achieving a predetermined 
profit target. They find that for these measures, the risk averse MR retailer is more 
green than a risk neutral retailer.
</p>
<p>Choi (2013) considers a dual-supply model in a newsvendor framework for a 
fashion retailer employing a quick response system. In contrast to Rosič and 
Jammernegg (2013) above, both supply options (i.e., orders both to the offshore and 
onshore suppliers) occur before the selling season starts. Between the time of the 
first ordering opportunity (with the offshore supplier), O, and the time of second 
order opportunity (with the local supplier), L, it is assumed that the fashion retailer 
can improve its demand forecast. The analysis shows how a properly designed per 
unit tax can be used to enhance the environmental sustainability by sourcing more 
(or solely) from the local (onshore) supplier with less emissions. However, the 
emissions are not modelled explicitly.

<p>8.3.1.2  Multi-period Single-Echelon Models Considering Modal Choice 
</p>
<p>and Shipment Consolidation
</p>
<p>The literature on inventory management of multi-period single-echelon inventory 
systems is very large. However, there are relatively few papers on green inventory 
management approaches that explicitly consider emissions or environmental con-
cerns. Issues emphasized in this emerging literature, so far, are modal choice and

</p>
<p>shipment consolidation. This makes sense, as transportation is one of the major 
sources of emissions in logistics.
</p>
<p>Hoen et al. (2014) consider a single item, single-echelon, infinite horizon, peri-
odic review inventory model, where replenishments are made in the beginning of 
each period according to an order-up-to-S (or base-stock) policy. Demand is 
assumed to be continuous and stochastic, and all unsatisfied demand is backordered. 
In this basic modeling context the authors study how carbon emission regulations 
can affect a firm&rsquo;s choice of transportation mode for inbound deliveries. More pre-
cisely, the firm can choose between transport mode options with different constant 
lead-times (Li, i = 1, 2, &hellip; I), costs, and emission characteristics. The firm can only 
choose one option involving a single transport mode (i.e., terminal to terminal trans-
port is assumed). The considered cost components for transport mode i are: a back-
order cost per unit and time unit (pi), a holding costs per unit and time unit (hi), and 
purchase and transportation costs per unit (ci). The holding and transportation costs 
depend on the emissions for transport mode i via an emission cost, ce, per unit of 
emissions. This emission cost can reflect an emissions regulation, for example, in 
terms of a carbon tax. The emissions associated with shipping one unit on transport 
mode i, ei, depend on the transportation distance, constant and variable emission 
factors, and load factors. The expected costs Ci(Si|ce) for transport mode i, with 
base-stock level Si, and emission cost ce, can be expressed as

<p>The optimal base-stock level, Si, that minimizes Ci(Si|ce) coincides with the 
solution to the traditional newsvendor problem (see, for example, Axs&auml;ter 2006). 
The transport mode that minimizes the expected costs for a given emission cost, 
ce, are easily obtained by comparing the cost-minimizing solutions for each trans-
port mode.

<p>The authors investigate how the choice of transportation mode depends on the emis-
sion cost by deriving intervals for ce where different modes are preferred. These 
intervals indicate how high a carbon tax needs to be in order for a certain transport 
mode to be selected. From a small numerical study, based on realistic values for 
cost parameters and emissions, they conclude that the emission cost typically needs 
to increase drastically for a greener transport mode to be preferred. This suggests

<p>210
</p>
<p>that emission taxes are blunt weapons for achieving emission reductions through 
modal shifts. On the other hand, introducing emission constraints that force a 
change may lead to significantly higher costs. However, the authors are careful to 
note that in practice many other issues outside their model may influence the choice 
of transportation mode.
</p>
<p>Turning to issues of shipment consolidation and joint deliveries, Larsen and 
Turkensteen (2014) analyze a VMI (Vendor-Managed Inventory) system by jointly 
modeling shipment consolidation, routing, and retailer inventory decisions using a 
JRP (Joint Replenishment Problem) approach. A vendor with ample stock is sup-
plying a product to a large number of geographically dispersed retailers. The objec-
tive is to minimize the total inventory and transportation costs. The retailers are 
assumed to be identical and uniformly distributed over a two-dimensional (circular) 
area, or a one dimensional line, for example, describing a transportation corridor. 
The retailers, experiencing Poisson-distributed demand, are grouped into zones, 
where each zone is replenished by joint deliveries on a single vehicle. Each retailer 
incurs holding and backorder costs and uses an order-up-to-S policy to replenish its 
inventory.
</p>
<p>The replenishment orders from zone j accumulate at the vendor, and correspond-
ing stock units are reserved and placed in a transportation bin. When the level Vj is 
reached (i.e., the bin is full) a dispatch is made (at the end of the considered time 
period). Hence, a quantity-based shipment release policy is used. The holding costs 
for units in the transportation bin are attributed to zone j. The transportation costs 
include a fixed cost per dispatch, a cost per distance unit traveled, and a fixed cost 
per retailer visited. As demand is stochastic, a shipment may contain replenish-
ments to only a subset of the retailers in zone j. Because retailers are identical, it is 
easy to determine the probabilities for m retailers in zone j being replenished by a 
shipment. The expected length of a delivery route can then be estimated using con-
tinuous approximations. The detailed specification of the transportation costs 
enables an analysis of how the inventory decisions affect the vehicle utilization and 
transportation distances. Turkensteen and Larsen (2013) build on these results and 
in conjunction with an engine emission model they provide a method for evaluating 
the expected transport-related CO2 emissions for the VMI system at hand. A numer-
ical study illustrates that as the fixed dispatch costs increase, the CO2 emissions 
decrease. This is a result of using shorter less frequent delivery routes (smaller 
zones) with increased load factor, and comes at the price of more inventory.
</p>
<p>Shipment consolidation may be done in many different ways (the quantity-
based policy above is just one example) and there is a large body of literature that 
focuses on inventory management of single-echelon systems using various types 
of shipment consolidation (or release) policies (e.g., &Ccedil;etinkaya and Lee 2000; 
Axs&auml;ter 2001; &Ccedil;etinkaya and Bookbinder 2003; Chen et al. 2005; &Ccedil;etinkaya et al. 
2006; &Ccedil;etinkaya et al. 2008; Mutlu and &Ccedil;etinkaya 2010; Mutlu et al. 2010; Kaya 
et al. 2012). These papers typically study inventory management at a vendor, 
which dispatches consolidated shipments to a number of retailers (the inventory 
management of these are not considered), with the objective to minimize holding 
and transportation costs. Emissions or environmental effects are in general not

</p>
<p>explicitly evaluated in this literature. An exception is Merrick and Bookbinder 
(2010) that use simulation to investigate how three commonly used shipment 
release policies can affect transport emissions. However, arguably, many of the 
cost models in this existing literature could be extended to include evaluations of 
expected emissions, particularly if the transport emissions can be modelled analo-
gous to the transportation costs, i.e., by a fixed component per dispatch and a 
variable component proportional to the number of units on the shipment.
</p>
<p>Another stream of literature of interest from a green inventory management per-
spective is the one focusing on inventory management of perishable products. 
Extensive reviews are provided in Nahmias (2011) and Karaesmen et al. (2011). A 
perishable item is characterized by having a limited life span during which it has a 
constant value (or utility). When that life span ends the item loses its value and 
needs to be disposed of. This may fit many different types of products, but from an 
environmental perspective, food and pharmaceuticals are important examples 
where the disposal of outdated and wasted products may have a big financial and 
environmental impact, not only in terms of GHG emissions. The existing models 
for inventory management of perishable items (excluding the trivial special case of 
the newsvendor model) focus on cost minimization or profit maximization and do 
not, to our knowledge, explicitly consider emissions or environmental conse-
quences. However, it is easy to incorporate evaluation of these sustainability issues 
as the analysis generally renders the expected number of perished items associated 
with certain inventory policy decisions. The challenge to reconcile the economic 
and environmental objectives and determine the best decision from a sustainable 
inventory management perspective still remains though. The perishable item litera-
ture is because of its complexity focused on inventory management of single-eche-
lon systems. However, considering multi-echelon systems, as in Olsson (2010), is 
an interesting venue for future research in green inventory management.
</p>
<p>8.3.2  Green Multi-Echelon Inventory Management
</p>
<p>In multi-echelon inventory management, the scope is extended from managing a 
single stock-point, to jointly managing a system of connected inventory locations, 
typically, upstream and downstream in a supply chain. The simplest multi-eche-
lon structure is a serial system where each inventory location has exactly one 
predecessor and one successor. In distribution of finished goods, the divergent 
structure, where each inventory location has one predecessor but many succes-
sors, is very common. Conversely, in manufacturing, assembly systems, where 
each inventory location can have many predecessors but only one successor is 
commonly seen. Managing a network of connected inventory locations clearly 
increases the complexity, but also the degrees of freedom and potential for green 
supply-chain solutions. The substantial literature on stochastic multi-echelon 
inventory management still contains few models that explicitly incorporate emis-
sions or environmental consequences, but the field is emerging.
</p>
<p>8 Green Inventory Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>212
</p>
<p>Stenius et al. (2016) consider green inventory management of a distribution 
system with a central warehouse supplying goods to a number of retailers (in 
accordance with a VMI agreement) using a time-based shipment consolidation 
policy with periodic shipment intervals. The central warehouse has access to 
inventory and point of sale information for the entire system in real-time through 
an integrated IT system. The free flow of demand information means that there 
are no incentives for batch ordering at the retailers. However, fixed costs for 
handling and shipping, together with ambitions to reduce transport emissions, 
create strong incentives for shipment consolidation and joint deliveries to 
groups of retailers. The presented model extends the work in Marklund (2011) 
by enabling exact evaluation of load- dependent non-linear shipment costs and 
emissions. A key result is the derivation of the probability distribution for the 
number of units on each shipment. Based on these results, a setting emphasizing 
the model&rsquo;s usefulness from a sustainability perspective is further analyzed. It 
involves capacitated dual transport options from the central warehouse to the 
retailers, and is motivated by industry applications. Transportation capacity can 
be reserved in advance at an intermodal shuttle train solution (or alternatively at 
a fleet of modern low-emission trucks). If this capacity is insufficient when a 
shipment is to be dispatched, truck transports available on demand (typically a 
more emission-intensive option) are used as a complement. The analysis, assum-
ing Poisson demand, shows how to jointly optimize the reorder levels (at the 
warehouse and all retailers), the shipment intervals (to all retailer groups), and 
the capacity reservation quantities (for all shipments) so as to minimize the total 
expected costs. Emissions are taken into consideration by use of a side con-
straint on the total expected emissions or alternatively by introducing emission 
costs. The analysis is applicable to both single- and multi-item systems. A 
numerical example, based on realistic cost and emission data illustrates how the 
model can be used for evaluating the cost impact of managerial decisions to 
reduce emissions. It indicates that relatively large reductions of the expected 
emissions can be achieved without severe cost increases. However, minimizing 
the emissions may increase the costs significantly. For instance, reducing the 
CO2 emissions by 24 % compared to the cost optimal solution only increases the 
expected costs by 3.5 %. To achieve this, the shipment intervals (time between 
shipments) are increased, and more capacity is reserved on the train, resulting in 
an additional 10 % of the total shipment volume to be moved from truck to train. 
The inventory is also increased to compensate for the longer lead times. On the 
other hand, minimizing the expected emissions leads to a maximum reduction 
of 34.5 % compared to the cost optimal solution, while this causes the expected 
costs to increase by 17.5 %.
</p>
<p>Berling and Mart&iacute;nez-de-Alb&eacute;niz (2015) use a continuous serial system (i.e., a 
serial system with infinite number of stages) to investigate the economic and envi-
ronmental benefits of adjusting the speed at which a unit is transported through the 
system, based on the current inventory situation. This can be interpreted as the value 
of slow steaming or despeeding of the supply chain when the situation allows it. 
Applying the model to a road transport case study illustrates that substantial savings 
</p>
<p>J. Marklund and P. Berling</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>213
</p>
<p>in both cost and emissions can be attained by adjusting the speed to the inventory 
situation rather than using a fixed speed policy (savings of 7 % and 20 % respec-
tively were recorded).
</p>
<p>So far, there are few models that incorporate emissions associated with not 
satisfying customer demand on time, still in some cases these emissions may be 
quite significant and most relevant to consider. One area where the impact of 
insufficient service often is quite severe is in the distribution of spare parts. The 
parts are often quite small suggesting limited emissions associated with transpor-
tation, inventory holding, and warehousing. However, not delivering them 
promptly may have serious consequences on costs and emissions. The former is 
accentuated by an increasing use of service contracts with high penalty costs and 
liability clauses in case of insufficient service fulfillment. A related issue is the 
use of emergency shipments to reduce the impact of shortages and associated 
downtime costs commonly seen in practice.
</p>
<p>Johansson and Olsson (2016) consider a model motivated by collaboration with 
a spare parts service provider in the dairy industry. In this case, failure to provide a 
spare part within a relatively short time limit after a machine breakdown leads to 
grave environmental and economic consequences. The reason is that the entire pro-
duction batch, of, say, yogurt, must be discarded and the facility must be cleaned 
before production may be resumed. The analysis deals with a one-warehouse-N- 
retailer system and provides a method for evaluating and minimizing the expected 
costs by optimizing the base-stock levels at all facilities. The method also enables 
evaluation of the expected emissions associated with not satisfying the demand 
within the given time window.
</p>
<p>As indicated above, when shortages occur it is often economically rational 
to use emergency shipments even though they are generally more expensive 
and emission- intensive than regular shipments. At least if they are supplied 
from the same location as regular orders. The increased emissions may be 
caused by use of faster and more emission-intensive modes of transportation 
(e.g., air instead of road or sea), or by reduced load efficiencies in vehicles 
used for emergency deliveries. One may interpret costs and emissions for 
emergency shipments as a consequence of not succeeding in satisfying cus-
tomer demand on time through the regular system. Avoiding unnecessary use 
of emergency shipments is therefore a way towards green inventory manage-
ment. A first step in this direction is to assure that the inventory control system 
provides the intended service. Berling and Marklund (2014b) use simulation to 
study this issue at a Scandinavian spare parts provider for agricultural machin-
ery. The company&rsquo;s distribution system consists of a central warehouse (located 
in the south of Sweden) and a large number of retailers/dealers spread out 
across the Scandinavian countries. The objective is to investigate the potential 
of reducing total costs and transport emissions. This is done by simulating the 
system when applying the multi-echelon inventory control methods presented 
in Berling and Marklund (2013, 2014a) instead of the methods currently used 
by the company. The simulation study, encompassing a stratified sample of 106 
</p>
<p>8 Green Inventory Management</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>214
</p>
<p>representative items, shows that by using the reorder points obtained from the 
multi-echelon method, transport-related CO2 emissions are reduced by 57 %, 
the inventory holding costs are down by 18 %, and the demand-weighted aver-
age fill-rate across retailers and items increased by 34 %. These results illus-
trate that avoiding unnecessary shortages by implementing inventory control 
methods with better precision can be a first low hanging fruit in achieving more 
sustainable inventory management in practice.
</p>
<p>Another aspect, discussed above, is that many existing models for evaluation and 
minimization of expected costs have a potential for incorporating evaluation of 
emissions or environmental aspects to some extent. We make no attempt to review 
the multi-echelon literature from this perspective, but we would like to highlight 
two areas with apparent sustainability potential: the use of advance demand infor-
mation, and systems that allow for lateral transshipments and/or include emergency/
quick response stocks.
</p>
<p>Use of advance demand information essentially means that customers place 
(firm) orders before they need the products. The time between the order place-
ment and demand realization represents a time buffer that offers possibilities to 
reduce inventories and/or use greener but slower transportation options. The use 
of different shipping alternatives by Amazon is one example motivating the work 
in Chen (2001). Other examples from the multi-echelon inventory literature on 
advance demand (or advance order) information include &Ouml;zer (2003), Gallego and 
&Ouml;zer (2003) and Marklund (2006). To our knowledge the literature does not yet 
contain any sustainable inventory management models that explicitly consider 
advance demand (or advance order) information in conjunction with emissions or 
environmental consequences.
</p>
<p>Inventory systems with lateral transshipments (sometimes referred to as com-
plete pooling models) are characterized by multiple retailers sharing their inven-
tory by agreeing to transship stock between them when needed. For a recent 
literature overview we refer to Paterson et al. (2011). From an emissions point of 
view, lateral transshipment systems offer interesting opportunities to combine 
short distance transshipments by environmentally friendly electrical or biogas 
vehicles, with long- distance consolidated shipments by diesel truck, train, or 
ship to a geographical region. A related system structure seen in practice is one 
with partial pooling, where designated support warehouses with quick response 
stocks offer local warehouses fast emergency deliveries to avoid shortages (e.g., 
Kranenburg and van Houtum (2009), Axs&auml;ter et al. (2013) and Howard et al. 
(2015)). In principle they offer the same possibilities to combine consolidated 
deliveries to a region with fast short- distance emergency shipments. The mana-
gerial complexity to coordinate decisions is reduced in these systems at the 
expense of reduced potential for inventory pooling. To our knowledge, no com-
plete or partial pooling models that explicitly consider emissions are yet avail-
able in the literature.

<p>8.4  Concluding Remarks About Findings, Practical 
</p>
<p>Implications, and What Remains to be Done
</p>
<p>A recurring finding throughout this chapter is that sustainable inventory manage-
ment can offer opportunities to reduce emissions quite substantially (from a cost-
minimizing solution) with relatively small increases in total costs. However, 
attaining solutions that minimize emissions may be costly.
</p>
<p>Several case studies have shown through simulation of real data that companies 
can improve the cost and service performance of the inventory management system 
by using better inventory control methods. More recent studies illustrate that this 
finding can carry over to the environmental aspect as well. A common problem in 
practice is that the inventory management system does not deliver the intended ser-
vice. This leads to additional shortages and if these shortages give rise to e.g., emer-
gency shipments or goods being wasted, the additional emissions can be significant. 
Examples from work cited above show reductions of expected costs of 18 % along 
with emission reductions of up to 57 % linked solely to improved inventory control 
and better fulfillment of target service levels. This without involving changes to 
order quantities, shipment frequencies, mode of transport, shipment consolidation 
policies, etc. This illustrates a promising improvement potential of inventory man-
agement practices to simultaneously reduce both costs and emissions.
</p>
<p>With respect to the studied regulatory systems that policy makers may invoke to 
reduce emissions, the conclusion from several models is that a cap and trade system 
is more attractive from a company perspective (less costly) than carbon taxes or 
systems with fixed emission caps. Moreover, indications are that complete modal 
shifts to greener transportation alternatives are difficult to attain by use of carbon 
taxes alone, unless they are extremely high. At the same time, other results suggest 
that multimodal transport solutions or dual-supply options may offer attractive com-
promise solutions.
</p>
<p>A noteworthy finding is that most of the existing literature on green (or sustain-
able) inventory management is based on very simple inventory models, particularly 
the EOQ-model and the newsvendor model. More general inventory models that 
incorporate emissions and other environmental consequences are needed in order to 
offer adequate tools for practical use. The literature is growing but much remains to 
be done. Existing inventory models with pure cost or profit focus can be a good 
starting point, if the emissions structure and cost structure coincide.
</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the practical use of any green inventory management method 
requires access to accurate emissions (and cost) data at appropriate levels of detail. 
To avoid suboptimization and achieve reductions in total costs and emissions for a 
supply chain, inventory management decisions should be considered in conjunction 
with transportation and production planning decisions, and strategic decisions such 
as network-configuration, modal shifts, etc. To facilitate this, standardization of 
emission measurements and calculations across different industries, companies, and 
activities that cause emissions (production, transportation, warehousing, etc.) are 
important. Otherwise, evaluating trade-offs and total effects become ambiguous.

</p>
<p>9.1  Introduction
</p>
<p>Transportation emissions comprise a large share of the world&rsquo;s overall emissions, 
</p>
<p>and freight transport is responsible for a relatively large share of these emissions. 
</p>
<p>Transportation emissions can be reduced by making different choices in logistics, 
</p>
<p>such as in changing the mode of transport or changing routing or loading of the 
</p>
<p>vehicles in the network (see Chap. 7 by Blanco and Sheffi (2017) for more on green 
</p>
<p>logistics). These logistics choices are influenced significantly by the inventory 
</p>
<p> policies that have been deployed in a company (see Chap. 8 by Marklund and 
</p>
<p>Berling (2017) for more on green inventory management). For instance, allowing 
</p>
<p>for a more carbon-friendly slow mode of transportation would typically require 
</p>
<p>increasing or repositioning the inventory in the supply network.
</p>
<p>Apart from logistics choices and inventory policies, the transportation perfor-
</p>
<p>mance in terms of costs and emissions is strongly determined by the design of the 
</p>
<p>network. In distribution networks, this refers in particular to the location of distribu-
</p>
<p>tion centers or other transport hubs such as factories or cross-docks. In this chapter, 
</p>
<p>we will address the issue of locating such a transport hub.
</p>
<p>The logistics problem that determines the configuration of a company&rsquo;s delivery 
</p>
<p>of goods is the facility location problem. The facility location problem is to locate a 
</p>
<p>set of facilities (e.g., factories, cross-docks, distribution centers) in a physical space, 
</p>
<p>such that all the demands of the customers are assigned to at least one facility and

</p>
<p>the total transport cost is minimized. While the literature of facility location is 
</p>
<p> well- established and large in size, in this chapter, we focus on a variant of this 
</p>
<p> problem that specifically includes the transport carbon emissions in the formulation. 
</p>
<p>We refer to location problems that aim at minimizing transportation CO2 emissions 
</p>
<p>as Green Facility Location problems.
</p>
<p>By limiting the scope to emissions from mobile sources (i.e., transport), we 
</p>
<p> obviously do not consider emissions from stationary sources that could be influ-
</p>
<p>enced by the location decision. Without being exhaustive, these may include:
</p>
<p> &ndash; Emissions at the distribution center. These relate to the energy usage of the 
</p>
<p> distribution center. In most cases this would be electricity for light and/or 
</p>
<p> automation, and for refrigeration. Potentially economies of scale could exist that 
</p>
<p>would be related to the design of the network. Industry data suggest that in most 
</p>
<p>distribution networks, the emissions at the distribution center are less than 10 % 
</p>
<p>of the total logistics-related emissions
</p>
<p> &ndash; Availability of local energy sources. In particular for energy-intensive  operations, 
</p>
<p>the availability of renewable local energy may significantly impact the supply 
</p>
<p>chain emissions. For instance, locating an aluminum plant in an area where 
</p>
<p> geothermal electricity is available could reduce a supply chain&rsquo;s overall carbon 
</p>
<p>emissions while still increasing its transport emissions.
</p>
<p>Excluding the emissions from stationary sources from the models discussed in 
</p>
<p>this chapter implies that effectively we are limiting ourselves to distribution net-
</p>
<p>works and the location choice of distribution centers and cross-docks. However, in 
</p>
<p>our discussion we use the more general term &ldquo;facility.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Usually companies designing their distribution channels select the locations of 
</p>
<p>warehouses and distribution centers with the objective to serve the demand of the 
</p>
<p>customers while minimizing distance (or transport costs). In this chapter, we review 
</p>
<p>some models that include the transportation CO2 emissions in the uncapacitated 
</p>
<p>facility location. We then discuss the solutions we may obtain when the number of 
</p>
<p>facilities to be located is fixed by using the p-Median problem. We present discus-
</p>
<p>sions and managerial implications for the green facility location. We are interested 
</p>
<p>in learning whether location decisions obtained by cost minimization are different 
</p>
<p>from those obtained by the green facility location model.
</p>
<p>9.1.1  Facility Location and Carbon Emissions
</p>
<p>Typically, facility location decisions are made by considering the associated costs 
</p>
<p>that include transportation (from the facilities to the customers) and the operation of 
</p>
<p>the facility (production and storage). As discussed above, we may split the main 
</p>
<p>sources of CO2 emissions associated to the location of facilities in a similar way: 
</p>
<p>emissions from mobile sources (transportation) and emissions from stationary 
</p>
<p>sources (production, storage, and handling). Having more facilities reduce the CO2 
</p>
<p>emissions from mobile sources due to the fact that the distance from the facility to 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>221
</p>
<p>the customer destinations decreases. Obviously, this increases emissions from sta-
</p>
<p>tionary sources due to their larger number. Therefore, the challenge in green facility 
</p>
<p>location is to define the proper number and position of the facilities that will serve a 
</p>
<p>set of customers while minimizing the overall CO2 emissions.
</p>
<p>Many studies show that transportation and production may substantially 
</p>
<p> contribute to CO2 emissions. For example, the three main contributing sectors to 
</p>
<p>emissions in the developed world are electricity production, energy-intensive 
</p>
<p> manufacturing, and transportation (European Commission 2011). While produc-
</p>
<p>tion of electricity and energy-intensive manufacturing are considered within Scope 
</p>
<p>1 and 2 of the GHG inventory, transportation by service providers is considered 
</p>
<p>within the Scope 3 emissions (see Chap. 3 by Boukherroub et al. (2017) for further 
</p>
<p>detail). Scope 3 emissions often represent the largest source of GHG emissions and 
</p>
<p>in some cases can account for up to 90 % of the total carbon impact (Carbon Trust 
</p>
<p>2013). In addition, when the facility location problem consists of locating distribu-
</p>
<p>tion centers instead of manufacturing plants, typically the CO2 emissions from 
</p>
<p>mobile sources are much higher those of the stationary sources, as the latter then 
</p>
<p>only include the emission at the distribution center. Storage and handling  emissions 
</p>
<p>are substantially smaller than transportation emissions, by a factor of 10 for some 
</p>
<p>products (Cholette and Venkat 2009). Therefore, in this chapter, we will focus on 
</p>
<p>studying the location of distribution centers with main emphasis on transportation 
</p>
<p>carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>Many practices exist in industry to reduce carbon emissions by implementing 
</p>
<p>more efficient and sustainable practices into their logistics operations (e.g., Heineken 
</p>
<p>Sustainability Report (2013), Groupe Danone (2014), MIT-EDF (2013)) However, 
</p>
<p>very few have considered the location of distribution centers as an relevant alterna-
</p>
<p>tive to reduce transportation CO2 emissions. One of the exceptions may be Unilever, 
</p>
<p>which increased the number of regional hubs and located these hubs closer to the 
</p>
<p>customers (Unilever Press Release (2013)).
</p>
<p>The location of facilities is critical to the efficient and effective operation of a 
</p>
<p>supply chain; poorly placed plants can result in excessive costs and low service 
</p>
<p>level no matter how well tactical decisions (e.g., vehicle routing, inventory manage-
</p>
<p>ment) are optimized (Daskin et al. 2005). In this chapter we demonstrate that facil-
</p>
<p>ity location choice may significantly impact mobile CO2 emissions in the supply 
</p>
<p>chain. Note that the main drivers of transportation carbon emissions are distance, 
</p>
<p>truck load (Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard 2011), and the number of trips 
</p>
<p>required to deliver demand to each customer. Changing the number and location of 
</p>
<p>the facilities in the distribution network impacts all of these drivers.
</p>
<p>9.1.2  Trade-Off Between Cost and Carbon Emissions 
</p>
<p>in the Facility Location
</p>
<p>Transportation costs (TC) in facility location problems typically take demand (w) 
</p>
<p>and distance (d) into account. These costs are usually modeled as an objective func-
</p>
<p>tion using the demand-weighted total distance (TC =awd ), and assuming an α

<p>222
</p>
<p>constant cost per distance per unit (Revelle et al. 2008). Notice that this formulation 
</p>
<p>finds optimal solutions where the facilities are closer to regions with high demand. 
</p>
<p>However, for minimizing transportation CO2 emissions, good solutions may require 
</p>
<p>a different analysis.
</p>
<p>Transportation CO2 emissions are affected by a variety of conditions related to 
</p>
<p>the type of vehicle (e.g., engine power, torque, fuel type, aerodynamic drag 
</p>
<p> coefficient) and the characteristics of the delivery operation (e.g., road, slope, 
</p>
<p> vehicle speed, load) (Ak&ccedil;elik and Besley 2003). Due to the lack of detailed informa-
</p>
<p>tion about the delivery operation (specific slopes, speed, aerodynamics, etc.) during 
</p>
<p>the decision-making process, companies typically use more aggregate activity-
</p>
<p>based methods to estimate CO2 emissions (see Chap. 3 by Boukherroub et al. (2017) 
</p>
<p>for more background on carbon footprinting). Two of the most common activity-
</p>
<p>based methods are the GHG Protocol and the methodology developed by the 
</p>
<p>Network for Transport and Environment (NTM). Because the GHG Protocol 
</p>
<p> methodology  typically uses an emission factor that is independent of the type of 
</p>
<p>vehicle or type of road (United States Environmental Protection Agency 2011) 
</p>
<p>(GHG Protocol Calculation Tools 2011), a facility location model minimizing CO2 
</p>
<p>emission based on the GHG protocol would provide optimal locations that are iden-
</p>
<p>tical to cost- minimization model solutions, i.e., optimal locations tend to be closer 
</p>
<p>to regions with high demand. However, this does not hold necessary when a more 
</p>
<p>detailed approach like the NTM methodology is used.
</p>
<p>The NTM methodology requires more detailed parameters: fuel consumption, 
</p>
<p>distance travelled, and weight per shipment (NTM Road 2010). The fuel con-
</p>
<p>sumption is a function of the type of truck, the load factor, and the type of road. 
</p>
<p>NTM uses the European Assessment and Reliability of Transport Emission 
</p>
<p>Models and Inventory Systems&rsquo; database which developed a detailed emission 
</p>
<p>model for all transport modes to provide consistent emission estimates at the 
</p>
<p>national,  international, and regional level (TRL 2010). The NTM estimation 
</p>
<p>model is:

</p>
<p>Comparing transport cost and CO2 emissions, notice that the effect of distance is 
</p>
<p>linear in both expressions. However, demand and truck capacity drive the transport 
</p>
<p>cost in a different way from driving the CO2 emissions. Figure 9.1 shows the 
</p>
<p> comparison of transport costs and CO2 emissions for different demand levels. For 
</p>
<p>the example we use a 14-t truck for urban road type and we set 100 demand units 
</p>
<p>equivalent to 1 t.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>223
</p>
<p>Note that the growth in demand does not translate into a linear increase in CO2 
</p>
<p>emissions, as it is in cost. For example, a demand of 20,000 units increases the cost 
</p>
<p>up to 20 % while the increase in CO2 is approximately of 5 %. The chart also shows 
</p>
<p>that an increase in demand has an impact on CO2 emissions mainly when this growth 
</p>
<p>implies more trips.
</p>
<p>Because of these differences in the transport cost and CO2 emission structures, 
</p>
<p>intuitively we may conclude that facility location models with one or the other 
</p>
<p>objective function may have different optimal solutions. While cost-minimization 
</p>
<p>models find optimal locations closer to high-demand nodes, CO2 minimization 
</p>
<p>models may also consider optimal locations closer to demand nodes where a 
</p>
<p>larger number of trips are required to serve the customer&rsquo;s demand. This charac-
</p>
<p>teristic of CO2 minimization models may be observed in both the high-demand 
</p>
<p>nodes and for restricted truck accessibility constraint in the nodes. Therefore, in 
</p>
<p>facility location problems, solutions obtained by minimizing transportation cost 
</p>
<p>are not necessarily equivalent to solutions obtained by minimizing transportation 
</p>
<p>CO2 emissions.
</p>
<p>9.2  Green Facility Location Models
</p>
<p>In this section we present some general facility location models that are commonly 
</p>
<p>studied in the logistics literature, including both continuous and discrete models. 
</p>
<p>We later discuss some extensions of these models that study CO2 emissions in loca-
</p>
<p>tion decisions.

</p>
<p>9.2.1  Traditional Facility Location Models
</p>
<p>The facility location problem has a very long history. It was first introduced by 
</p>
<p>Weber (1909) and a large number of extensions and applications can be found in the 
</p>
<p>literature. For a basic explanation of the facility location problems we refer to 
</p>
<p>(Daskin 2008) (Daskin et al. 2005) and for recent reviews we refer to (Melo et al. 
</p>
<p>2009) (Revelle et al. 2008). Typically, facility location problems are classified 
</p>
<p>based on their solution space as continuous if the candidate locations can be located 
</p>
<p>anywhere within the area or discrete if the candidate facilities are restricted to a 
</p>
<p>finite set of locations (Daskin 2008). In addition, when continuous models assume 
</p>
<p>that demands are distributed continuously across a service region, this approach is 
</p>
<p>known as analytical location model.
</p>
<p>The continuous and analytical approaches provide a general overview of the opti-
</p>
<p>mal locations, and are commonly used for researchers to provide guidelines or insights 
</p>
<p>(Geofrion 1976). A variety of applications can be found in the literature related to 
</p>
<p>extensions of location models, such as hub location problem (Saberi and Mahmassani 
</p>
<p>2013), freight transport network (Campbell 2013), and hub-and-spoke network design 
</p>
<p>(Carlsson and Jia 2013). For analytical models, solution methods are derived by using 
</p>
<p>mathematical analysis, while for continuous location models that are not analytically 
</p>
<p>solveable, iterative numerical procedures ensure its convergence to optimal solutions, 
</p>
<p>for example the Weiszfeld algorithm (Weiszfeld 1936) for the Weber problem.
</p>
<p>For practical applications, discrete formulations are more realistic to provide 
</p>
<p>feasible and optimal locations, but are more difficult to solve. For this type of mod-
</p>
<p>els, candidate locations are pre-screened based on complementary information such 
</p>
<p>as supplier&rsquo;s proximity, labor proximity, local regulations, and available physical 
</p>
<p>space, among others. The basic model that locates the optimal facility among a set 
</p>
<p>of candidate locations in a discrete space is known as the p-Median problem. 
</p>
<p>The p-Median problem is defined as follows (Revelle and Swain 1970):
</p>
<p>Let I be a set of demand nodes and J be a set of candidate locations.
</p>
<p>Parameters:
</p>
<p>hi demand at node i I&Icirc;
</p>
<p>dij distance between candidate facility site j J&Icirc;  and customer location i I&Icirc;
</p>
<p>Decision variables:
</p>
<p>Xj 1 if we locate at site j J&Icirc; ,  0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>Yij  fraction of demand at customer location i I&Icirc;  that is served by facility at site 
j J&Icirc; .
</p>
<p>The p-Median problem is then formulated as follows (P1):

<p>The objective function minimizes the demand-weighted total distance. Constraint 
</p>
<p>(1) states that each demand node is covered. Constraint (2) establishes that p facili-
</p>
<p>ties are located. Constraint (3) states that the facility is opened when a demand node 
</p>
<p>is assigned. Constraints (4) are the integrality constraints and (5) are the  non- negative 
</p>
<p>constraints. When applied to a general network, the p-Median problem can be 
</p>
<p> difficult to solve. However, since the single sourcing condition holds in this formu-
</p>
<p>lation (i.e., Yij will naturally take values of zero or one), the property limits the 
</p>
<p>potential facility locations to the network nodes, and therefore it reduces the number 
</p>
<p>of possible location configurations to n n p p!/ ! !-( ) , where n is the number of 
nodes (Owen and Daskin 1998). However, a total enumeration of all possible 
</p>
<p> solutions may be computationally prohibited. Kariv and Hakimi (1979) showed that 
</p>
<p>the p-Median problem is NP-hard.
</p>
<p>The p-Median problem has been the basis of multiple extensions such as the 
</p>
<p>fixed charge facility location problem, both uncapacitated and capacitated, and in 
</p>
<p>other problems such as multi-item and multi-echelon (Geoffrion and Graves 
</p>
<p>1974) (Pirkul and Jayaraman 1996). It also has multiple real-world applications 
</p>
<p>such as plant location-allocation (Daskin and Dean 2005), network design 
</p>
<p>(Kalpakis et al. 2001), (Ruffolo et al. 2007), (Stephens et al. 1994), sensor 
</p>
<p> deployment (Greco et al. 2010), and data mining (Christou 2011). Other 
</p>
<p> applications are presented in ReVelle et al. (2008). The p-Median problem has 
</p>
<p>also attracted much research attention in combinatorial optimization and many 
</p>
<p>solution methods have been proposed to solve the problem. For instance, variable 
</p>
<p>neighborhood search (Hansen and Mladenovi 1997), genetic algorithm (Hosage 
</p>
<p>and Goodchild 1986), tabu search (Rolland et al. 1997), scatter search (Garc&iacute;a-
</p>
<p>L&oacute;pez et al. 2003), ant colony optimization (Kochetov et al. 2005), and simulated 
</p>
<p>annealing (Murray and Church 1996). Pullan (2008) finally presents a population-
</p>
<p>based hybrid search that was tested again in multiple instances from literature and 
</p>
<p>the results show that the algorithm finds the optimal solutions for many problems, 
</p>
<p>and for others it was capable of finding improvements on the best known solutions 
</p>
<p>from literature.
</p>
<p>A natural extension of the p-Median problem is to relax the number of facilities 
</p>
<p>to be opened p and include a fixed location cost fj. This problem is called the fixed 
</p>
<p>charge facility location problem (P2) (Balinski 1965):

<p>9.2.2  Carbon Emissions in Facility Location Models
</p>
<p>We now discuss some models that include the estimation of CO2 emissions in the 
</p>
<p>facility location problem. As mentioned in Sect. 9.1, transportation CO2 emissions 
</p>
<p>in facility location models should be considered carefully, specifically because cost 
</p>
<p>and CO2 emissions structures do not typically share the same structures. However, 
</p>
<p>some studies show that even when this is the case, still solutions obtained by mini-
</p>
<p>mizing transport cost are not necessarily equivalent to solutions obtained by mini-
</p>
<p>mizing CO2 emissions.
</p>
<p>9.2.2.1  Analytical and Continuous Models
</p>
<p>We start by discussing the study of Bouchery and Fransoo (2015) on intermodal 
</p>
<p>hinterland network design. The authors present an analytical model that aims at 
</p>
<p>finding the optimal location of one facility (in their example an inland container 
</p>
<p>terminal) with respect to cost, carbon emissions, and modal shift objectives. The 
</p>
<p>demand is assumed to be uniform over a rectangle region representing the hinter-
</p>
<p>land of the port under consideration. The density of the demand is equal to ρ con-
</p>
<p>tainers per square kilometer and the origin of the flows (the port) is located at 
</p>
<p>coordinates (0, 0).
</p>
<p>The model assumes that transport cost and carbon emissions have the same struc-
</p>
<p>ture, and considers two transport mode options: direct shipment (shipment via truck 
</p>
<p>directly from the origin to the customer) and intermodal transportation (shipment via 
</p>
<p>rail to an intermodal terminal and subsequently from the terminal via truck to the cus-
</p>
<p>tomer). The cost and CO2 emissions of serving a demand region i of size Ai by using 
</p>
<p>direct shipment are expressed as follows: Z A Zi i i0 0 1, ,
DS = d r  and E A Ei i i0 0 1, ,
</p>
<p>DS = d r , 
</p>
<p>respectively, where:
</p>
<p>δo,i distance from the port to the gravity center of demand zone i (km)
</p>
<p>Z1 truck transportation cost per container-kilometer
</p>
<p>E1 carbon emissions from truck transportation (kg of CO2 per container-km)
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>EF2 fixed emissions associated to train transportation (kg of CO2 per km)
</p>
<p>E2 linear train transportation emissions (kg of CO2 per container-km)
</p>
<p>The authors identify optimal solutions based on European data.
</p>
<p>Their results show that the terminal is located closer to the port when  optimizing 
</p>
<p>cost and is located further away from the port when optimizing carbon emissions. 
</p>
<p>This result shows that even when cost and CO2 emissions have the same structure, 
</p>
<p>there are significant differences in the optimal solutions for both formulations. This 
</p>
<p>effect is clearly explained by the differences in the fixed train parameters, which is 
</p>
<p>also consistent to the fact that train transportation under high utilization is more 
</p>
<p>efficient from the emissions perspective than truck, but it is more expensive in terms 
</p>
<p>of cost. For more details we refer to the full study (Bouchery and Fransoo 2015).
</p>
<p>Although some other articles on continuous green facility location models can be 
</p>
<p>found in the literature, the area is still very scarce. Buyuksaatci and Esnaf (2014) 
</p>
<p>present a carbon emission-based facility location problem that considers the mini-
</p>
<p>mization of CO2 emissions by using the gravitational center method. The study uses 
</p>
<p>a formulation based on the GHG protocol, but it does not discuss any managerial 
</p>
<p>insight or implication derived from the proposed formulation.
</p>
<p>9.2.2.2  Discrete Models
</p>
<p>We now discuss the studies on green facility location models with discrete formula-
</p>
<p>tions. Diabat and Simchi-Levi (2010) present a two-level multi-commodity facility 
</p>
<p>location problem with a carbon constraint. Their problem is to decide the optimal 
</p>
<p>location of plants and distribution centers and the assignment, in such a way that the 
</p>
<p>total costs are minimized and the carbon emissions do not exceed a specific carbon 
</p>
<p>cap. The model assumes carbon emissions from distributions by using a distance 
</p>
<p>emission factor (tons of CO2 per km), and thus neglecting the impact of the load on 
</p>
<p>CO2 emissions (see Chap. 7 Blanco and Sheffi (2017), that explains how transporta-
</p>
<p>tion emissions are also affected by the load of the vehicles in the network). Despite 
</p>
<p>this rather coarse assumption, the general conclusion seems in line with intuition: 
</p>
<p>if carbon emission allowance decreases, supply chain cost increases
</p>
<p>Elhedhli and Merrick (2012) study a supply chain network design problem that 
</p>
<p>takes CO2 emissions into account. The objective of the study is to simultaneously 
</p>
<p>minimize logistics costs and the environmental costs of CO2 emissions by strategi-
</p>
<p>cally locating warehouses within the distribution network. This model considers the

</p>
<p>GHG protocol estimation of CO2 emissions and uses a scaling parameter to convert 
</p>
<p>the CO2 into cost. This approach allows inclusion of the cost of carbon emissions 
</p>
<p>into supply chain network design. The experimental results show that the addition 
</p>
<p>of carbon costs drives solutions with more distribution centers be opened to decrease 
</p>
<p>CO2 emissions in transportation.
</p>
<p>Although the study provides interesting managerial insights, the model uses the 
</p>
<p>most aggregate approaches to estimate CO2 emissions in transportation (i.e., the 
</p>
<p>GHG protocol with EPA emission factors). Vel&aacute;zquez-Mart&iacute;nez et al. (2014a) 
</p>
<p>address the effects of using different aggregation levels to measure transport carbon 
</p>
<p>emissions, and they show that errors associated with aggregation could be substan-
</p>
<p>tial and systematic. This suggests that increasing the level of detail in the facility 
</p>
<p>location problem is necessary.
</p>
<p>Cost may not necessarily be the only driver to reduce CO2 emissions in transpor-
</p>
<p>tation. For example, companies may be subject to a cap-and-trade system, or may 
</p>
<p>use carbon emission reductions as a driver for brand management, product differen-
</p>
<p>tiation, or employee motivation (CDP 2011a, b). This suggests that a practical for-
</p>
<p>mulation of green facility location models should potentially take simultaneously 
</p>
<p>cost and CO2 objectives into account.
</p>
<p>A possible alternative to consider both objectives (cost and CO2 emissions) is to 
</p>
<p>model the green facility location problem using a multi-objective setting. Most real- 
</p>
<p>world problems naturally involve multiple objectives (minimizing cost, maximiz-
</p>
<p>ing service level, minimizing CO2 emissions, etc.) A Multi-objective approach 
</p>
<p>allows to define a set of efficient solutions (or a Pareto frontier) which are defined 
</p>
<p>as the set of solutions such that there is no other solution that dominates them, i.e., 
</p>
<p>each solution of the set is strictly better than the rest of the solutions in at least one 
</p>
<p>objective and is not worse than the rest of the solutions in all objectives (Coello 
</p>
<p>2009). These efficient solutions are often preferred to single solutions because they 
</p>
<p>can be practical when considering real-life problems since the final solution of the 
</p>
<p>decision maker is always a trade-off (Konak et al. 2006).
</p>
<p>In line with this stream of research, Harris et al. (2014) present a formulation of 
</p>
<p>the fixed charge facility location model (P3) with two objective functions: costs and 
</p>
<p>CO2 emissions. Their facility location model considers individual depots with capac-
</p>
<p>ities bj, where each customer is served directly by a single depot, and thus, forcing 
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;single sourcing condition&rdquo; to be held in the model. Therefore, it is possible to 
</p>
<p>build a solution algorithm that first determines which facilities to open, and then to 
</p>
<p>allocate the customers to the open facilities. The study proposes an expression to 
</p>
<p>estimate transportation CO2 emissions based on the GHG protocol, i.e., transporta-
</p>
<p>tion CO2 emissions are linearly dependent on the distance travelled and demand.
</p>
<p>The study discusses a multi-objective optimization solution method for the cost 
</p>
<p>and CO2 facility location model, in which a decision maker can explore trade-off 
</p>
<p>solutions for customer allocation based on the pre-selected facility location. 
</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 (Harris et al. 2014) shows the different solutions of the location decision, 
</p>
<p>and for each decision, the potential allocation assignment.
</p>
<p>The article focuses on the solution methods and provides a framework to analyze 
</p>
<p>trade-offs between cost and CO2 emissions for location models.

</p>
<p>Because we notice that all previous studies conclude that the increase in the 
</p>
<p>number of open facilities implies a reduction on CO2 emissions (and typically more 
</p>
<p>facilities also imply higher costs), we may argue that a practical approach to ana-
</p>
<p>lyze the trade-off between cost and CO2 emissions in facility locations, is to sim-
</p>
<p>plify the formulation by not including the fixed emission per open facility. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, we are interested in studying the effect of transportation cost versus 
</p>
<p>transportation CO2 emissions with a fixed amount of facilities previously defined 
</p>
<p>(i.e., p-Median problem).
</p>
<p>V&eacute;lazquez-Mart&iacute;nez et al. (2014b) study the trade-off between cost and CO2 emis-
</p>
<p>sions by using a multi-objective approach for the facility location problem. The model 
</p>
<p>corresponds to the p-Median problem with cost and CO2 objective functions. The 
</p>
<p>general assumptions of the p-Median problem are applicable to this model; that is, 
</p>
<p>deterministic demand and the candidate locations are known in advance. In  addition, 
</p>
<p>the model also assumes that the company may manage multiple trucks with different 
</p>
<p>capacities and the trucks are assigned according to demand node  constraints (or com-
</p>
<p>pany policy). These assumptions allow the model to include the possibility that certain 
</p>
<p>customers are reachable only by certain types of trucks, with distinct cost structures.
</p>
<p>To formulate the carbon emissions objective function, the authors include the 
</p>
<p>NTM methodology in the objective function (V&eacute;lazquez-Mart&iacute;nez et al. 2014b).

</p>
<p>This formulation enables us to understand in more detail the trade-off between 
</p>
<p> distance (dij) and utilization (hi/Wi) while deciding the location-allocation deci-
</p>
<p>sions. For example, when serving customers with a homogeneous fleet (i.e., W W
i
=  
</p>
<p>for all i I&Icirc; ), the location solutions are the same as those that are obtained by P1, 
</p>
<p>i.e., facilities are located closer to customers with the highest demand, and thus 
</p>
<p>minimizing transport cost is equivalent to minimizing CO2 emissions. However, 
</p>
<p>when serving customers with a non-homogeneous fleet (e.g., caused by truck con-
</p>
<p>straints due to regulations or transport infrastructure), facilities may be located 
</p>
<p>closer to customers served by small trucks. This may be explained due to the fact 
</p>
<p>that multiple trips are required and thus more distance is travelled to serve these 
</p>
<p>customers.
</p>
<p>9.3  Practical Implications of the Green Location Models
</p>
<p>Transportation is one of the main contributing factors of global carbon emissions, 
</p>
<p>and thus, when dealing with facility location models in a distribution context, trans-
</p>
<p>portation emissions may be substantially higher than the emissions due to produc-
</p>
<p>tion or storage. In addition, because facility location models define the configuration 
</p>
<p>of deliveries, green location models become an important alternative to reduce CO2 
</p>
<p>emissions in logistics. Because transportation usually is included in Scope 3 of the 
</p>
<p>GHG inventory, and usually represents the highest source of emissions in a supply 
</p>
<p>chain, companies may start focusing more on increasing the number of distribution 
</p>
<p>centers while increasing the reachability to customers.
</p>
<p>While cost-minimization solutions tend to locate facilities closer to high-
</p>
<p>demand customers, CO2 emissions minimization solutions tend to locate facilities 
</p>
<p>closer to customers that have truck accessibility constraints. This is explained 
</p>
<p>because truck constraints drive the number of trips required to serve customers, 
</p>
<p>and this factor is larger than the increase in demand and/or utilization. This may be 
</p>
<p>particularly important for companies managing non-homogeneous vehicle fleet, or 
</p>
<p>for policy makers in large dense areas where demand is high (based on the high 
</p>
<p>density of inhabitants and small stores), but heavy-duty vehicles are not allowed. 
</p>
<p>New regulations may be needed to balance the accessibility of big trucks in certain 
</p>
<p>periods to increase logistics efficiency and to also reduce the number of small vehi-
</p>
<p>cle in those regions.
</p>
<p>For some logistics problems, even when aggregate approaches are used to esti-
</p>
<p>mate transportation CO2 emissions and thus this formulation shares the same struc-
</p>
<p>ture with transportation cost, the location solutions may be substantially different. 
</p>
<p>For companies that are interested in increasing modal shift or using more intermo-
</p>
<p>dal transport, these strategies may result in increase in CO2 emissions. Particularly 
</p>
<p>when different modes are used like in intermodal networks, the difference in param-
</p>
<p>eters for transportation cost and CO2 emissions can lead to a completely different 
</p>
<p>set of solutions for both objective functions.

</p>
<p>A multi-objective setting for the green facility location models may provide 
</p>
<p>decision makers with a framework to analyze the trade-off between cost and CO2 
</p>
<p>emissions. This approach may bring a new tool for companies to define better strate-
</p>
<p>gies to reduce CO2 emissions. Because decision makers likely seek alternatives that 
</p>
<p>reduce emissions but keep costs low, multi-objective modeling provides a set of 
</p>
<p>trade-off solutions that were previously unknown in single objective modeling. This 
</p>
<p>may imply that new solutions may appear with good offset of cost and CO2 emis-
</p>
<p>sions. For example, locations where small increases in cost may imply high reduc-
</p>
<p>tions of CO2 emissions.
</p>
<p>9.4  Directions for Future Work

</p>
<p>cost and CO2 emissions do not have the same structure, a specific formulation for

<p>CO2 emissions minimization model for facility location should be considered. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately few studies consider the detailed expression to estimate transporta-
</p>
<p>tion CO2 emissions in location models, and most of them use GHG protocol, and 
</p>
<p>thus, the complete effect has not been studied and understood.
</p>
<p>In addition, only a few companies have implemented strategies using facility 
</p>
<p>locations to reduce their environmental impact. Thus, more applications of the 
</p>
<p> models in practical cases are needed so more understanding of the models and 
</p>
<p>trade-off can be achieved and validated in practice. In addition, a few articles from 
</p>
<p>prior literature include in their formulations the emissions generated by the facili-
</p>
<p>ties, and usually only the production of electricity. The models are mainly focus on 
</p>
<p>the emissions causes by transportation, and specifically for the last-mile delivery. 
</p>
<p>However, no research has been conducted to analyze the impact of transportation of 
</p>
<p>raw materials in facility locations, and thus, more model formulations are needed to 
</p>
<p>address this gap.
</p>
<p>In addition, considering the different sources of energy for the facilities (wind, 
</p>
<p>fuels, etc.) and to include them in the future green facility location models to 
</p>
<p> understand the impact of energy source on plan locations, is a fruitful research ave-
</p>
<p>nue. Furthermore, including other type of pollutants&mdash;such as noise, particulate 
</p>
<p>matter, CO, and NOx&mdash;as possible objective functions in the green facility location 
</p>
<p>models is a worthwhile research direction. For this problem, researchers may need 
</p>
<p>to develop new heuristics strategies to accommodate the complexities.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we have limited our discussion on the impact of emissions from 
</p>
<p>mobile sources, within which carbon and other pollutants are the most impactful. 
</p>
<p>Inclusion of environmental effects of stationary sources has not yet been studied in 
</p>
<p>the facility location problem. As discussed above, this could also relate to carbon 
</p>
<p>emission, for instance due to local presence of renewable energy sources. However, 
</p>
<p>also other effects could then be taken into account, such as the effect of the location 
</p>
<p>choice on the water footprint.

<p> Operational Implications of Environmental 
Regulation

</p>
<p>10.1          Introduction and Motivation 
</p>
<p>  Industrial production and consumption activities   may have adverse environmental 
</p>
<p>implications that lead to calls from the public, environmental groups, and  non- 
</p>
<p>governmental organizations (NGOs)   for regulatory measures to promote sustain-
</p>
<p>able practices in supply chains. As a result, many different forms of environmental 
</p>
<p>regulations have been considered or enacted in the recent years, in many countries, 
</p>
<p>and for various industries. Examples of those include the Restriction of Hazardous 
</p>
<p> Substances      (RoHS) (2002/95/EC) (Europa-Environment  2002 ), the  End-of-Life 
</p>
<p>Vehicle (ELV)   (2000/53/EC) (Europa-Environment  2000 ), and the  Waste Electrical 
</p>
<p>and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)   (2003/108/EC) (Europa-Environment  2003 ) 
</p>
<p>Directives of the European Union, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the US 
</p>
<p>(RGGI  2013 ), and the new electronic waste (e-waste) regulation in China (State 
</p>
<p>Council of China  2008 ). 
</p>
<p> Environmental regulation is inevitably an infl uential factor on different facets of 
</p>
<p>fi rm operations. Nevertheless, implementation choices for environmental regulation 
</p>
<p>are often made based on certain implicit assumptions that do not take into account 
</p>
<p>fi rms&rsquo; possible operational choices driven by such regulation or other dynamics on 
</p>
<p>the implementation ground. Existing research in operations management has suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully demonstrated that this is indeed the case. In particular, recent operations 
</p>
<p>management research has challenged numerous implicit assumptions made by 
</p>
<p>high-impact regulations such as the  WEEE Directive  , identifi ed the associated unin-
</p>
<p>tended consequences, and provided recommendations regarding the implications of 
</p>
<p>different implementation choices for environmental regulation on the environment, 
</p>
<p>supply chains, and the economy in general.

</p>
<p> In this chapter, we review a number of research papers to highlight challenges 
</p>
<p>associated with environmental regulation implementations, particularly in the con-
</p>
<p>text of take-back regulation, given its popularity in the last decade. These papers 
</p>
<p>cover a broad spectrum of possible issues that may arise in the transposition of regu-
</p>
<p>lative principles into working systems. Some of them challenge the assumptions 
</p>
<p>implicitly embedded in the forms or specifi cations of regulation; some of them point 
</p>
<p>out possible loopholes of regulation; and others identify how differences across the 
</p>
<p>regulated industries or the nature of products will necessitate different supply chain 
</p>
<p>responses to environmental regulation. These papers collectively show that the devil 
</p>
<p>is in the details and highlight the importance of an operational perspective in design-
</p>
<p>ing, implementing, and coping with environmental regulation. 
</p>
<p> Consequently, we posit that  an operational lens   is crucial for defi ning appropriate 
</p>
<p>environmental regulation implementation models so that regulators can set proper 
</p>
<p>boundaries and scope for environmental regulation. We further suggest that sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain managers should have a clear understanding of the operational implica-
</p>
<p>tions of different regulation implementations in order to maintain the environmental 
</p>
<p>and economic sustainability of their supply chains. In what follows, we fi rst pro-
</p>
<p>vide a basic background on environmental regulation, followed by our unit of 
</p>
<p>analysis, take-back regulation. We then take a deep dive into operational chal-
</p>
<p>lenges associated with such regulation and conclude with insights for supply 
</p>
<p>chains and regulators.  
</p>
<p>10.2     Some Background on Environmental Regulation 
</p>
<p> The  environmental policy literature   contains many different classifi cations of 
</p>
<p>regulatory instruments (see Richards  1999 , for a detailed discussion), which can 
</p>
<p>differentiate environmental regulations in multiple dimensions: Some regulations 
</p>
<p>are product-related (such as the WEEE and the  RoHS Directives   of the European 
</p>
<p>Union) and others are facility-related (such as the Clean Water Act (EPA  2015 )). 
</p>
<p>Some regulations impose restrictions (e.g., the RoHS Directive) and others require 
</p>
<p>only disclosures (such as the US Consumer Protection Act, see Kalkanci et al. 
</p>
<p> 2015 ). Some regulations are international (such as the Basel Convention (BAN 
</p>
<p> 2005 ) and the US Responsible Recycling Act (Kyle  2011 ) for waste export), some 
</p>
<p>are national (such as the WEEE Directive), and some are local (such as the 26 state 
</p>
<p>level e-waste recycling regulations in the US (ETBC  2013 )). 
</p>
<p> Among those,  classifi cations   that focus on policy implementation choice differ-
</p>
<p>ences are relevant from a supply chain perspective. In this context, Fullerton ( 2001 ) 
</p>
<p>is a very useful reference that classifi es environmental policy in two basic dimen-
</p>
<p>sions: with respect to the form of control imposed by regulation, and the type of 
</p>
<p>incentives utilized by regulation. In the fi rst classifi cation dimension, one distin-
</p>
<p>guishes between emission restrictions (sometimes called performance standards) 
</p>
<p>and technology restrictions (sometimes referred to as design standards). Examples 
</p>
<p>of the former include the greenhouse gas emission restrictions with cap-and-trade 
</p>

</p>
<p>systems that can be found in different parts of the world including the US and the 
</p>
<p>EU (Islegen et al.  2015 ). Examples of the latter include the RoHS Directive and the 
</p>
<p>requirements to install fl ue-gas desulphurization  in electric plants   (Fullerton  2001 ). 
</p>
<p>In the second  classifi cation   dimension, one distinguishes between the types of 
</p>
<p>incentives, i.e., taxes and subsidies. Examples of the former include the carbon 
</p>
<p>taxes such as those used in Australia (Islegen et al.  2015 ) and examples of the latter 
</p>
<p>include renewable energy credits (Ata et al.  2010 ). The unit of our analysis,  e-waste 
</p>
<p>take-back regulation  , typically operates under a mix of these policy instruments. 
</p>
<p>Some of these policies use performance standards such as collection and recycling 
</p>
<p>targets imposed on producers (e.g., the WEEE Directive) and others charge unit 
</p>
<p>disposal taxes to consumers or producers, as in California and Washington State, 
</p>
<p>respectively (ETBC  2013 ). We provide a more detailed discussion on e-waste take- 
</p>
<p>back regulation next. 
</p>
<p> The momentum for the recent rapid development of take-back regulation is 
</p>
<p>driven by the urge to manage the growing volume of e-waste. The average lifespan 
</p>
<p>of a computer has shrunk from 6 years in 1997 to just 2 years in 2005 (Greenpeace 
</p>
<p> 2010 ). In 2010, 384 million units (2 . 4 million tons) of e-waste entered municipal 
</p>
<p>waste streams in the US, with more than 142 , 000 computers and 416 , 000 mobile 
</p>
<p>devices thrown away every day. Less than 20 % of those were recycled, and the rest 
</p>
<p>were sent to landfi lls or incinerators (EPA  2011 ).  Landfi lling and incineration  , how-
</p>
<p>ever, can lead to release of hazardous substances such as dioxins, lead and mercury 
</p>
<p>into the air, soil, or water, posing serious threats to the environment and public 
</p>
<p>health. To deal with this problem, take-back regulation organizes proper treatment 
</p>
<p>of e-waste, through environmentally friendly collection and recycling. 
</p>
<p> The majority of take-back regulation implementations utilize the Extended 
</p>
<p>Producer Responsibility (EPR)  principle  ,  which   directs the fi nancial or physical 
</p>
<p>responsibility of proper end-of-life product treatment to producers (see Walls  2006 , 
</p>
<p>for an extensive overview) via performance standards or disposal taxes as explained 
</p>
<p>above. The rationale behind EPR is to have producers internalize the negative envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental impacts created by their products, so that they fi nd incentives to redesign 
</p>
<p>their products to overcome such externalities. As such, take-back regulation based 
</p>
<p>on EPR aims to not only divert end-of-life products from landfi lls, but also create 
</p>
<p>incentives for producers to embed environmentally superior attributes in their prod-
</p>
<p>ucts (OECD  2001 ). This potential of EPR appears to explain its popularity across 
</p>
<p>the globe. The  WEEE Directive of the European Union  , which probably has the 
</p>
<p>largest scope in the world, is EPR-based. Moreover, despite the lack of federal level 
</p>
<p>regulation in the US, 25 out of the 26 states (except for CA) that have passed state 
</p>
<p>level e-waste bills stipulate producer responsibility (ETBC  2013 ). 
</p>
<p> It is important to note that successful implementation of and response to environ-
</p>
<p>mental regulation are challenging (Drake and Just  2015 ). Be it with respect to take- 
</p>
<p>back, emissions control, or any other environmental objective, setting up the ground 
</p>
<p>rules for regulatory objectives is a critical step and should not rely on basic conve-
</p>
<p>nient assumptions. Recent research has observed that effi cient implementations 
</p>
<p>of  cap-and-trade or tax-based emission regulations   need to carefully consider 
</p>
<p>the incentives they create for carbon leakage (Islegen et al.  2015 , Sunar  2015 ). 
</p>
<p>10 Operational Implications of Environmental Regulation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>238
</p>
<p>Likewise, it has been shown that environmental taxes can drive producers to invest 
</p>
<p>in environmentally inferior technologies (Krass et al.  2015 ), and disclosure man-
</p>
<p>dates can drive producers towards not learning their actual environmental impacts 
</p>
<p>(Kalkanci et al.  2015 ). Similarly, in the context of take-back regulation&mdash;our unit of 
</p>
<p>analysis&mdash;the landfi ll diversion and product redesign potentials of EPR heavily rely 
</p>
<p>on certain premises, which, from a basic economic point of view may make sense. 
</p>
<p>These basic premises include (1) that recycling end-of-life products (particularly 
</p>
<p>electronics) must be costly and if left unregulated, hazardous waste will leak into 
</p>
<p>the environment (see Sect.  10.3 ), (2) take-back regulation will create incentives to 
</p>
<p>recycle only end-of-life products that can be considered as waste (see Sect.  10.4 ), 
</p>
<p>(3) design incentives coming out of take-back regulation will mainly focus on 
</p>
<p>designing more recyclable products (see Sect.  10.5 ), (4) such regulation is appropri-
</p>
<p>ate for most product categories including durables or consumables (see Sect.  10.6 ), 
</p>
<p>(5) regulatory distortion of competitive markets is not a concern (see Sect.  10.7 ), (6) 
</p>
<p>implementation details that relate to the existing reverse supply chain infrastruc-
</p>
<p>tures (networks) will not matter (see Sect.  10.8 ), and that (7) take-back and recy-
</p>
<p>cling take place in the country where the regulation is enacted (see Sect.  10.9 ). 
</p>
<p>While these assumptions may appear reasonable at the stage of designing and plan-
</p>
<p>ning to cope with potential take-back regulation, they (or the invalidity of any of 
</p>
<p>those) can be quite harmful in terms of the effi cacy of the implementations on the 
</p>
<p>ground and have important supply chain management implications, as we demon-
</p>
<p>strate in the following sections.  
</p>
<p>10.3      Trash or  Treasure  ? 
</p>
<p> A fundamental assumption underlying take-back regulation is that environmentally 
</p>
<p>sound treatment of end-of-life products is always costly. This also constitutes the 
</p>
<p>reason why regulation is needed in the fi rst place: to ensure that producers take the 
</p>
<p>responsibility for proper collection and recycling. The thinking that logically fol-
</p>
<p>lows is that increasing the stringency of requirements for regulatory compliance 
</p>
<p>should strengthen incentives for landfi ll diversion and environmentally friendly 
</p>
<p>design of products, which appears to underlie the 2012 Recast of the WEEE 
</p>
<p>Directive (2012/19/EU) increasing the collection target to 45 % by 2016, and then 
</p>
<p>to 65 % by 2019. However, in recent years, doubt has been cast on the assumption 
</p>
<p>of costly recycling, especially with the roaring prices and scarcity of certain raw 
</p>
<p>materials. For example, the amount of gold that can be recovered from 1 mt of com-
</p>
<p>puters is 17 times greater than that from a gold ore of equal weight (USGS  2001 ). 
</p>
<p>In other words, recycling some of the e-waste can be more profi table than metal ore 
</p>
<p>mining. Consequently, it appears that producers may be motivated to recycle some 
</p>
<p>electronics voluntarily even in the absence of take-back regulation. At the same 
</p>
<p>time, it is important to note that this opportunity presents itself to others as well, i.e., 
</p>
<p>third party recyclers may also be attracted into the product recovery business, intro-
</p>
<p>ducing competition in the market for end-of-life products with recoverable value. 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>239
</p>
<p>These observations slightly contradict the costly recycling premise, and may imply 
</p>
<p>challenges on the effectiveness of take-back regulation, which is explored by 
</p>
<p>Esenduran et al. ( 2014 ). 
</p>
<p> In their paper, Esenduran et al. ( 2014 ) consider a stylized model of a recycling 
</p>
<p>market in which producers and third party recyclers may compete for recycling 
</p>
<p>valuable waste. They focus on a single product category. After reaching the end-of- 
</p>
<p>life, products remain in the hands of a set of waste-holders that may be geographi-
</p>
<p>cally dispersed. The recoverable value in each waste-holder&rsquo;s product may vary 
</p>
<p>depending on its proximity to the producers and recyclers. Hence, producers and 
</p>
<p>recyclers can extract different values from end-of-life products, and they compete 
</p>
<p>on acquiring the e-waste from waste-holders by respectively offering recovery 
</p>
<p>prices. Given the recovery prices and their respective value heterogeneity, waste- 
</p>
<p>holders decide on whether and to whom to return their end-of-life products to maxi-
</p>
<p>mize their utilities from waste recovery. In this context, the  authors   assume take-back 
</p>
<p>regulation in the form of a collection and recycling target imposed only on the 
</p>
<p>producers. They further assume that producers can enhance the product end-of-life 
</p>
<p>value by increasing the recyclability at a cost. 
</p>
<p> The authors show the following: Even when waste has value, the existence of 
</p>
<p>regulation may be necessary if the producers exhibit a strong position in terms of 
</p>
<p>their access to the recoverable waste. The reason is that although the value of waste 
</p>
<p>turns into some incentives for the producers to recycle, it is only limited to inducing 
</p>
<p>recycling of the &ldquo;low-hanging fruits&rdquo; (i.e., easier or cheaper to access items). As a 
</p>
<p>result, the recycling level chosen by the producers remains below the social opti-
</p>
<p>mum. In this case, enacting regulation is benefi cial in several ways: It increases 
</p>
<p>landfi ll diversion, encourages more recyclable product design, and also guarantees 
</p>
<p>improvement of social welfare. However, in the presence of competition in the recy-
</p>
<p>cling market, regulation can lead to unintended consequences. First, more stringent 
</p>
<p>regulation can reduce landfi ll diversion. This is because an increased collection and 
</p>
<p>recycling target imposed only on the producers drives the producers to act more 
</p>
<p>aggressively in acquiring the products from waste-holders. This may lead to very 
</p>
<p>high prices paid to waste-holders, driving third party recyclers to hold back from the 
</p>
<p>product recovery market. Effectively, this suggests that the overall collection and 
</p>
<p>recycling volume in the end-of-life product market may suffer because the portion 
</p>
<p>of volume contributed by the third party recyclers may go down. Furthermore, this 
</p>
<p>may happen to an extent that the decrease in third party recycled volume actually 
</p>
<p>offsets the increase in producer recycling induced by take-back regulation. Second, 
</p>
<p>a higher collection and recycling target imposed on producers may discourage 
</p>
<p>improvement on product design. This is because the spill-over of design benefi ts 
</p>
<p>can be accentuated by competition, which makes design improvement a less appeal-
</p>
<p>ing option for the producers. In turn, the authors suggest that more stringent regula-
</p>
<p>tion may not always be ideal, particularly when waste is valuable. Rather, reducing 
</p>
<p>the stringency of collection and recycling targets imposed on producers, while regu-
</p>
<p>lating the third party recycling market in terms of the quality of recycling standards 
</p>
<p>may be an ideal solution from both the economic and environmental points of view 
</p>
<p>under such circumstances. The take-away from Esenduran et al. ( 2014 ) is that even 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>240
</p>
<p>the simplest and possibly the most reasonable assumption that underlies the need 
</p>
<p>for environmental regulation may be challenged by market dynamics. When this 
</p>
<p>happens, the solution may appear to be trivial, e.g., in the case of valuable e-waste 
</p>
<p>one may  argue   that the more value in waste, the more producers (or the supply chain 
</p>
<p>divisions that are responsible) will recycle. Yet, how the competition on the ground 
</p>
<p>functions may completely change this perspective. As demonstrated by Esenduran 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2014 ), competing for geographically dispersed heterogeneous waste in the 
</p>
<p>presence of design improvement options may imply the need for supply chain man-
</p>
<p>agers to think differently about how they cope with such regulation. In particular, 
</p>
<p>reverse supply chain managers will play a key role in such compliance efforts, as 
</p>
<p>they are the parties to see waste competition related issues and inform compliance 
</p>
<p>departments about such challenges in advance. In sum, the operational consider-
</p>
<p>ations (i.e., devil in the detail) that matter in this case are the geographical disper-
</p>
<p>sion of waste (see Dhanorkar et al.  2015 ; Sunar  2015  for similar observations in the 
</p>
<p>waste exchange and emissions regulation contexts) and whether and  how   producers 
</p>
<p>and their reverse supply chains can effectively access the waste under competition 
</p>
<p>with third parties.  
</p>
<p>10.4      End-of-Life or  Used Product Recycling  ? 
</p>
<p> Another basic assumption of take-back regulation is that in order to fulfi ll the EPR 
</p>
<p>obligation, producers solely obtain end-of-life products from waste-holders such as 
</p>
<p>municipal collection locations. Intuitively sound as it is, this assumption may not 
</p>
<p>directly extend to durable goods. In particular, durable good producers can also 
</p>
<p>acquire used (midlife) items from the secondary market for product recovery, 
</p>
<p>despite the remaining lifespans these items have. 
</p>
<p> Producers may have incentives to pull used products off the secondary markets 
</p>
<p>and use them as inputs for recycling due to two reasons. First, a secondary market 
</p>
<p>offers used products as cheaper (although maybe inferior) alternatives to the new 
</p>
<p>ones and hence potentially attracts consumers away from buying new products, i.e., 
</p>
<p>cannibalizes the new product sales. In this case, reducing the cannibalization consti-
</p>
<p>tutes a motivation for producers to interfere with, or even suppress the secondary 
</p>
<p>market. Second, acquiring used products also helps lower the need and cost of col-
</p>
<p>lecting end-of-life items to meet the collection target. In addition to being viable, 
</p>
<p>this option is also feasible for producers: They can obtain used products through 
</p>
<p>offering trade-ins or buyback programs. 
</p>
<p> However, from the environmental and regulatory standpoint, retiring used 
</p>
<p>products before they reach the end-of-life can be unfavorable because this practice 
</p>
<p>shortens the average useful life of products and increases the total waste volume. 
</p>
<p>This leads to two critical questions: How will the producers&rsquo; optimal strategies to 
</p>
<p>interfere with the secondary market change when faced with regulation? 
</p>
<p>Consequently, how will such interference infl uence the effectiveness of take-back 
</p>
<p>regulation? Alev et al. ( 2014a ) shed light on these questions. 
</p>
<p>X. Huang and A. Atasu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>241
</p>
<p> Alev et al. ( 2014a ) develop a stylized economic model to study the decisions of 
</p>
<p>a monopolist durable good producer under  EPR-based take-back regulation   with (1) 
</p>
<p>collection targets, which can be met by collecting both end-of-life or used products, 
</p>
<p>(2) requirements on collection infrastructure, which will be refl ected in the unit col-
</p>
<p>lection cost of end-of-life products, and (3) recycling standards, which will be 
</p>
<p>refl ected in the unit cost of  recycling   every product. Their analysis shows that the 
</p>
<p>decision of the producer on interfering with the secondary market is indeed infl u-
</p>
<p>enced by the regulation. This is evident by the fact that retiring used products can be 
</p>
<p>purely induced by the need to fulfi ll the regulative collection target and will not exist 
</p>
<p>in the absence of regulation. When such interference occurs, it can lead to a lower 
</p>
<p>reuse level and a higher new production volume, both commonly associated with 
</p>
<p>unfavorable environmental consequences. 
</p>
<p> In this case, the effectiveness of take-back regulation is weakened by the fact that 
</p>
<p>there are two types of collection channels that a durable good producer can strategi-
</p>
<p>cally use for compliance: In addition to collecting end-of-life products, the producer 
</p>
<p>can also acquire used products from consumers in the secondary market for recy-
</p>
<p>cling. Since the existence of this alternative collection channel is unique to durable 
</p>
<p>products, regulators and producers of durable products should pay particular atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the environmental and supply chain implications of take-back regulation. 
</p>
<p> From a regulator perspective, the results in Alev et al. ( 2014a ) suggest the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing: First, recycling standards remain effective. Higher recycling standards help 
</p>
<p>ensure the producer collect and recycle end-of-life products. Consequently, prema-
</p>
<p>ture retirement of used products decreases. Second, collection infrastructure require-
</p>
<p>ments bring in similar benefi ts as the recycling standards, but only up to a certain 
</p>
<p>stringency, beyond which their effect negates and leads to increased producer inter-
</p>
<p>ference with the secondary market. Finally, the effect of the collection target is not 
</p>
<p>always positive. To be specifi c, when the collection target increases within a low 
</p>
<p>value range, it may incentivize the producer to interfere with the  secondary   market, 
</p>
<p>and hence adversely results in increase in new production and decrease in reuse 
</p>
<p>levels. These results suggest that the take-back regulation for durable goods, while 
</p>
<p>achieving the objective of increasing the level of collection for recycling, may com-
</p>
<p>promise other environmentally sound objectives such as reuse and consumption 
</p>
<p>reduction. This outcome appears undesirable from the perspective of the well- 
</p>
<p>established  Waste Management Hierarchy  , which prioritizes reduce over reuse, and 
</p>
<p>reuse over recycling. 
</p>
<p> From the supply chain perspective, these observations once again highlight the 
</p>
<p>importance of the reverse supply chain manager&rsquo;s role in compliance. In particular, 
</p>
<p>the reverse supply chain manager who observes the costs of compliance and differ-
</p>
<p>ent product recovery options can help resolve such dilemmas for the fi rm. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the reverse supply chain manager can bridge the connections between 
</p>
<p>compliance and marketing departments to manage the acquisition of used products 
</p>
<p>through trade-in programs and direct such fl ows towards take-back regulation, 
</p>
<p>which appears to be the essence of Apple&rsquo;s recent  Recycling   and Reuse program 
</p>
<p>(Apple  2015 ).

</p>
<p>10.5      Durability or  Recyclability  ? 
</p>
<p> The durability embedded in products raises complexities in regulation in regards to 
</p>
<p>not only how it infl uences the collection decisions for producers by providing an 
</p>
<p>additional collection channel as discussed above, but also how it infl uences the 
</p>
<p>design decisions. Recall that incentivizing environmentally sound product designs 
</p>
<p>is one of the basic goals of take-back regulation. When regulation on recycling is 
</p>
<p>enforced, one expects that it should induce producers to make recycling cheaper by 
</p>
<p>improving product recyclability (e.g., incorporating easier disassembly features) in 
</p>
<p>the design. This assumption is also popular among regulators as refl ected in regula-
</p>
<p>tive statements. One example is the  E-waste Recycling Law in Washington State  , 
</p>
<p>which spells out that &ldquo;The legislature further fi nds that the system must encourage 
</p>
<p>the design of electronic products that are less toxic and more recyclable&rdquo; (New 
</p>
<p>Section, Sec 1, SB4628). However, for durable products, enhancing recyclability to 
</p>
<p>reduce the unit cost of recycling is not the only option for producers to alleviate the 
</p>
<p>total economic burden associated with the recycling obligation. Producers can also 
</p>
<p>improve the product durability to lower the recycling volume. The underlying ratio-
</p>
<p>nale is that making products more durable enables the producers to set a higher 
</p>
<p>price for new products and sell less, leading to a smaller amount of end-of-life 
</p>
<p>products and hence a lower total cost of recycling. As such, when recyclability and 
</p>
<p>durability are both available design options for producers, it may be of interest to 
</p>
<p>review the design implications of regulation. In particular, one would like to under-
</p>
<p>stand how the producer&rsquo;s design choices and the regulatory effi ciency change in the 
</p>
<p>presence of these alternative design options, especially when they are interdepen-
</p>
<p>dent. This problem is examined by Huang et al. ( 2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Huang et al. ( 2014 ) consider a monopolist producer selling a single durable 
</p>
<p>product and facing take-back regulation that imposes a collection target and a recy-
</p>
<p>cling target for end-of-life products. The producer, in response to take-back regula-
</p>
<p>tion, can choose both the product recyclability and durability in the design stage to 
</p>
<p>deal with the cost associated with the regulation. The authors fi nd that when the 
</p>
<p>product recyclability and durability are independent or complementary attributes, 
</p>
<p>increasing the recycling target helps induce the desired outcome with improvements 
</p>
<p>on both the product attributes. However, when recyclability and durability are sub-
</p>
<p>stitutes, the design trade-off between them can result in non-monotonic effects of 
</p>
<p>the recycling target, which is in sharp contrast to common expectations: As the 
</p>
<p>recycling target goes up, it fi rst leads to recyclability improvements (while the dura-
</p>
<p>bility may decrease) and then leads to durability improvements (while the recy-
</p>
<p>clability may decrease). Note that increasing recyclability in product design 
</p>
<p>encourages recycling by bringing down the unit recycling cost, while increasing 
</p>
<p>durability promotes waste reduction by  leading   to a lower production volume. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, when recyclability compromises durability, the design trade-off suggests 
</p>
<p>that recycling comes at the expense of waste reduction. Finally, contrary to the non- 
</p>
<p>monotonic effects of the recycling target, the collection target always favors recy-
</p>
<p>clability when recycling can generate value since a tighter collection target results 
</p>
<p>X. Huang and A. Atasu</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>243
</p>
<p>in an increase in recyclability while durability may be compromised due to the 
</p>
<p>recyclability-durability trade-off. 
</p>
<p> These conclusions send an important message to regulators: Design alternatives 
</p>
<p>for the producer to deal with the costs associated with the EPR obligation are criti-
</p>
<p>cal operational factors that infl uence the outcomes of take-back regulation. As dem-
</p>
<p>onstrated by Huang et al. ( 2014 ), the existence of durability as an alternative design 
</p>
<p>option to recyclability may not necessarily expand the effective scope of regulation 
</p>
<p>(i.e., enhance both product attributes). On the contrary, the possible trade-off 
</p>
<p>between design choices may diminish or even negate the effectiveness of regulation 
</p>
<p>(see Plambeck and Wang  2009 , Krass et al.  2015  for similar observations in the 
</p>
<p>context of new product introduction frequency and technology choices, 
</p>
<p>respectively). 
</p>
<p> From the supply chain perspective, these results once again suggest that effective 
</p>
<p>compliance with take-back regulation will require coordination between the reverse 
</p>
<p>supply chain manager, the compliance department and the design/engineering 
</p>
<p>department. Consider  photovoltaic panel (PVP)   producers for instance, who face a 
</p>
<p>clear trade-off between designing products for durability and recyclability (see 
</p>
<p>Huang et al.  2014  for details). The 2012 Recast of the WEEE Directive has recently 
</p>
<p>added PVPs into the regulated product categories. Even though compliance with 
</p>
<p>such regulation  may   not be a concern for the producers today because the  lifespans 
</p>
<p>of PVPs   are estimated to be 25 years, it will be critical for the producers to prepare 
</p>
<p>for future liabilities take-back regulation will impose on them. In this case, it is 
</p>
<p>important for PVP producers to plan for a reverse supply chain infrastructure that 
</p>
<p>will be able to accommodate different design profi les and help reduce future liabili-
</p>
<p>ties associated with PVP recycling.  
</p>
<p>10.6      Durable or Consumable  Products  ? 
</p>
<p> While our discussion so far has been centered around durable products,  EPR-based 
</p>
<p>take-back regulation   has also extended to consumable products in recent years, with 
</p>
<p>examples being the announcements of the  Pharmaceutical Stewardship Act of 2011   
</p>
<p>(H.R. 2939 (112th)  2011 ) and the Alameda County Safe Drug Disposal Ordinance 
</p>
<p>(Alameda County, CA  2012 ) in the US. 
</p>
<p> In the context of take-back regulation for consumables, leveraging experiences 
</p>
<p>from durable product markets may appear ideal. However, producers and regulators 
</p>
<p>must be aware of the implementation differences stemming from the consumable 
</p>
<p>and perishable nature of consumable products and adjust accordingly. In particular, 
</p>
<p>contrary to durable products, the volume of end-of-life waste does not equal to the 
</p>
<p>volume of production for consumables. Moreover, recovery options for consum-
</p>
<p>ables are limited because reuse and recycle are usually not applicable. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>regulation for consumables needs to focus more on reducing the volume of unused 
</p>
<p>items that are not disposed in an environmentally friendly way. In doing so, there 
</p>
<p>exist two prevalent implementation approaches. The fi rst is Source Reduction (SR), 
</p>
<p>10 Operational Implications of Environmental Regulation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>244
</p>
<p>which aims to lower production by charging a fee based on production volume. 
</p>
<p>The second is  End-of-pipe Control (EC)  , which mandates the producer to organize 
</p>
<p>or fi nance proper  waste   treatment. Given the product nature of consumables, further 
</p>
<p>exploration is needed in order to determine how one can choose between the SR and 
</p>
<p>the EC approaches to effectively improve  the   environmental and economic impacts 
</p>
<p>of regulation. Alev et al. ( 2014b ) pioneer in this area and their fi ndings depart con-
</p>
<p>siderably from the existing results for durable products. 
</p>
<p> The products considered in Alev et al. ( 2014b ) are consumable pharmaceuticals. 
</p>
<p>The decision makers in the pharmaceutical chain include a social planner, a 
</p>
<p>producer, a doctor and a patient, whose interactions are captured by a sequential 
</p>
<p>game model. The doctor acts as an intermediary between the producer and the con-
</p>
<p>sumer (the patient). Therefore, the sales volume of pharmaceuticals is not directly 
</p>
<p>determined by the consumer behavior, but by the doctor&rsquo;s prescription instead. The 
</p>
<p>prescription amount that exceeds the actual consumption by the patient (overpre-
</p>
<p>scription) constitutes the main source of pharmaceutical waste. The doctor makes 
</p>
<p>the prescription decision based on not only the cost of treatment and the impacts of 
</p>
<p>the prescription on patient&rsquo;s health, but also the doctor&rsquo;s own utility from the pre-
</p>
<p>scription. The producer infl uences the sales volume by deciding the market price, as 
</p>
<p>well as setting the promotion efforts on both the doctor and the patient. The social 
</p>
<p>planner chooses between the two implementation approaches of regulation from 
</p>
<p>below and sets the respective policy parameter.
</p>
<p>    (1)    EC: Requires the producer to collect a certain fraction of unused pharmaceuti-
</p>
<p>cals. The producer also bears the associated collection cost. This implementa-
</p>
<p>tion resembles a typical producer-operated collection and recycling system 
</p>
<p>observed in prevalent EPR implementations.   
</p>
<p>   (2)    SR: Imposes a fee on every unit of sales. After obtaining the fee payments, the 
</p>
<p>regulator manages the collection (e.g., chooses the collection level) and the 
</p>
<p>costs incurred. SR resembles a typical state-operated system observed in preva-
</p>
<p>lent EPR implementations.    
</p>
<p>  The analysis fi nds that for pharmaceuticals that are consumable in nature and 
</p>
<p>have a different demand structure with the doctor acting as an intermediary 
</p>
<p>between  production   and actual consumption, the comparison between the two 
</p>
<p>implementation approaches is very different from that for the durable products. 
</p>
<p>The paper shows that a producer-operated system (under EC) can be preferred by 
</p>
<p>a social planner when the following conditions are met: (i) the cost of collection is 
</p>
<p>high, (ii) the use-phase impact (i.e., the health condition improvement for the 
</p>
<p>patient) is less signifi cant, and (iii) the impacts on the society (e.g., medicine 
</p>
<p>abuses) and the environment (e.g., chemical contamination in the ecology) are 
</p>
<p>high. Notably, (iii) is in direct contrast to the conclusion for durables, which sug-
</p>
<p>gests that under similar condition the state-operated system should work more effi -
</p>
<p>ciently (Atasu et al.  2013 ). 
</p>
<p> This study, although solely focuses on pharmaceuticals, delivers an insightful 
</p>
<p>lesson that may be generalized for other consumables. The product nature is the 
</p>
<p>operational detail that matters. While take-back regulation is devoted to dealing 
</p>
<p>X. Huang and A. Atasu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>245
</p>
<p>with products that are at the end of their useful life, the defi nition of useful life can 
</p>
<p>vary substantially depending on the product nature. For a durable product, the end- 
</p>
<p>of- life item has lost its functionality and will not be demanded by consumers. For a 
</p>
<p>consumable, on the other hand, reaching the end of its useful life means it no longer 
</p>
<p>provides the original designated usage, but it may still be in a functional state and 
</p>
<p>may be consumed by others. This difference can signifi cantly affect the effi ciency 
</p>
<p>and implications of different regulation implementation choices as demonstrated by 
</p>
<p>Alev et al. ( 2014b ). 
</p>
<p> Therefore, the product nature must be carefully accounted for by regulators and 
</p>
<p>producers  in   order to avoid implementation choices that would compromise opera-
</p>
<p>tional or regulatory effi ciency. It is especially important that the reverse supply 
</p>
<p>chain manager understands these implementation issues. In particular, Alev et al. 
</p>
<p>( 2014b ) show that which implementation model will be preferred by a regulator 
</p>
<p>depends on the unused pharmaceutical collection infrastructure the producer has 
</p>
<p>access to. For instance, while leveraging existing pharmacies or municipal collec-
</p>
<p>tion systems may appear a low-cost option for the producer, in those circumstances 
</p>
<p>the regulator may favor a SR approach with higher taxes, eventually leading to a 
</p>
<p>lower profi t for the producer. In turn, the reverse supply chain design that serves 
</p>
<p>take-back compliance needs not be the most cost effi cient one in the context of 
</p>
<p>consumables. 
</p>
<p> Our discussion so far has demonstrated that the proper evaluation and develop-
</p>
<p>ment of policy instruments must be based on correct and thorough understanding of 
</p>
<p>the detailed operational characteristics of the target industries, including the com-
</p>
<p>modity market dynamics, the alternative strategic responses available to producers, 
</p>
<p>and the nature of products. Beyond that, the  devi  l in the details also matters in the 
</p>
<p>implementation stage, in which regulators and producers translate the regulation 
</p>
<p>into a working system. We illustrate this phenomenon in what follows.  
</p>
<p>10.7      Collective or Individual Producer  Responsibility  ? 
</p>
<p> Although  EPR-based take-back regulation   sets a unifi ed principle of assigning pro-
</p>
<p>ducer responsibility, it leaves discretion for regulators to choose the operationaliza-
</p>
<p>tion of product collection and recycling. Typically, two models of implementation 
</p>
<p>can be observed: Individual, and Collective Producer Responsibility (abbreviated as 
</p>
<p>IPR and CPR respectively, see Plambeck and Wang  2009  for a similar discussion). 
</p>
<p>Under IPR, each producer deals with only its own products. A somewhat similar 
</p>
<p>model is adopted by the Personal Computer Recycling Law in Japan, where prod-
</p>
<p>ucts are separated by brands after collection and then become the responsibility of 
</p>
<p>the corresponding producers. Under CPR, all participating producers jointly con-
</p>
<p>duct end-of-life product treatment and share the total costs. Examples of this model 
</p>
<p>can be seen in the WEEE Directive implementations in several EU member states. 
</p>
<p> Both IPR  and CPR models   have certain pros and cons, and neither of them is 
</p>
<p>dominantly better than the other. On one hand, CPR is commonly considered 
</p>
<p>10 Operational Implications of Environmental Regulation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>246
</p>
<p> superior in cost-effi ciency because it realizes economies of scale by aggregating the 
</p>
<p>collection and recycling of a large volume of products and also saves on the costs 
</p>
<p>associated with brand identifi cation and separation. However, CPR is criticized for 
</p>
<p>signifi cantly undermining the eco-design incentives. Under CPR where costs are 
</p>
<p>shared, the benefi ts (such as recycling cost reduction) from the individual design 
</p>
<p>efforts spill over to other producers or even competitors, and hence producers may 
</p>
<p>be less motivated to improve the product design for recyclability. The IPR model, 
</p>
<p>on the other hand, overcomes this weakness of CPR and creates stronger design 
</p>
<p>incentives because the independence of processing costs among producers under 
</p>
<p>IPR enables each producer to retain the returns from the investment on product 
</p>
<p>design improvements. Therefore, the choice between IPR and CPR is largely driven 
</p>
<p>by the trade-off between design incentives  and   cost-effi ciency. At the same time, the 
</p>
<p>impacts of these two factors also depend on the dynamics in the market. As such, it 
</p>
<p>is a useful exercise to compare the two models following Atasu and Subramanian 
</p>
<p>( 2012 ) and Esenduran and Kemahlioglu-Ziya ( 2015 ). 
</p>
<p> Atasu and Subramanian ( 2012 ) build a single-period model with a duopoly sales 
</p>
<p>market in which high-end and low-end products are sold respectively by two pro-
</p>
<p>ducers. Consumers make purchasing decisions based on their heterogeneous prod-
</p>
<p>uct valuations for the differentiated products. The regulation mandates producer 
</p>
<p>responsibility by imposing a binding recovery target for end-of-life products on 
</p>
<p>both producers. The regulation can adopt either the IPR or the CPR  model  . Under 
</p>
<p>IPR, each producer only pays the cost associated with its own products. Under CPR, 
</p>
<p>the two producers share the total processing cost. The cost-sharing can be set endog-
</p>
<p>enously (i.e., according to the return shares, which also refl ect the market shares in 
</p>
<p>this context) or exogenously (which will be predetermined and fi xed). In response 
</p>
<p>to the regulatory obligation, each producer can invest in improving the product 
</p>
<p>recovery attributes to reduce the cost of end-of-life recovery treatment of its 
</p>
<p>products. 
</p>
<p> By comparing the outcomes under IPR and CPR, the paper shows that incentives 
</p>
<p>to design more recoverable products exist under both models, but the incentives are 
</p>
<p>always weaker under CPR than under IPR. The reason is that CPR allows for one of 
</p>
<p>the producers to free-ride on the other&rsquo;s design efforts. Under CPR, although the 
</p>
<p>existence of free-riding is less surprising, the detail as to who free-rides can be 
</p>
<p>counterintuitive. When the cost-sharing is endogenous, the bigger contributor 
</p>
<p>(whose processing cost has a higher weight in determining the fi nal shared unit cost) 
</p>
<p>may suffer from being free-ridden just as expected. However, when the cost-sharing 
</p>
<p>is determined exogenously, the bigger contributor can become the free-rider. This 
</p>
<p>reversal of the outcome is caused by the competitive structure in the primary mar-
</p>
<p>ket. Under IPR, however, the market competition does not have direct infl uences on 
</p>
<p>the design incentives. In return, the free-riding under  CPR   also has feedback effects 
</p>
<p>on the primary market because the producer who benefi ts from free-riding can lower 
</p>
<p>the price more aggressively and hence provides a higher surplus to its consumers, 
</p>
<p>while its competitor only offers a lower consumer surplus. Note that these observa-
</p>
<p>tions are nicely aligned with perspectives from different fi elds such as industrial 
</p>
<p>ecology (Lifset and Lindhqvist  2008 ) and practitioners (Atasu et al. 2015).

</p>
<p> This analysis draws our attention to another operational aspect that matters in 
</p>
<p>implementing take-back regulation: The scope of responsibility, shared under CPR 
</p>
<p>versus independent under  IPR  , may have different infl uences on product design. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategic dynamics including competition and integration of the 
</p>
<p>compliance-related considerations into the design and pricing decisions for produc-
</p>
<p>ers are key drivers of take-back regulation effi ciency. 
</p>
<p> Interestingly, while also looking at the comparison between IPR and CPR, 
</p>
<p>Esenduran and Kemahlioglu-Ziya ( 2015 ) take a very different perspective: They 
</p>
<p>analyze how the coalition structure under the collective model matters. The compo-
</p>
<p>sition of a coalition is a non-trivial factor because it can vary dramatically in reality. 
</p>
<p>For example, the  European Recycling Platform (ERP)   that is set up in response to 
</p>
<p>the  WEEE   Directive mainly consists of large (in terms of market/return share) fi rms 
</p>
<p>including Braun, Electrolux, HP and Sony. On the contrary, the collective systems 
</p>
<p>set up by the local government authorities such as the one in Washington State cov-
</p>
<p>ers a much wider range of both big and small fi rms. The authors argue that the coali-
</p>
<p>tion structure in a collective system may have important implications as to the 
</p>
<p>effi ciency of the take-back regulation implementation. Esenduran and Kemahlioglu- 
</p>
<p>Ziya ( 2015 ) look at  n  fi rms with distinct market shares in a collective system. All 
</p>
<p>fi rms are subject to the same regulation that mandates a collection target. In response, 
</p>
<p>each fi rm can choose the recyclability of its products. A higher recyclability helps 
</p>
<p>reduce the unit cost of recycling, but it also incurs the cost of increased recyclability 
</p>
<p>because it makes production more expensive. To stay focused on the take-back con-
</p>
<p>text, the paper focuses on compliance-related costs that include  collection   and recy-
</p>
<p>cling costs, as well as the cost of increased recyclability. Compliance schemes can 
</p>
<p>be of two types. Under IPR, each fi rm sets the actual collection rate to minimize its 
</p>
<p>own overall cost. Under CPR, the central entity of the collective system determines 
</p>
<p>the actual collection rate to minimize the total cost of collection and recycling 
</p>
<p>incurred to the entire system, which will then be split among all producers by mar-
</p>
<p>ket shares. Note that the option of overcompliance for producers, i.e., the actual 
</p>
<p>collection being higher than the regulation target, is also considered. Economies of 
</p>
<p>scale are refl ected in the marginal recycling cost that is decreasing in the total recy-
</p>
<p>cling volume. 
</p>
<p> Esenduran and Kemahlioglu-Ziya ( 2015 ) show that under CPR, the equilibrium 
</p>
<p>recyclability level is lower for smaller fi rms, which is somewhat consistent with the 
</p>
<p>free-riding result in Atasu and Subramanian ( 2012 ). In addition, the paper also 
</p>
<p>reveals some unexpected conclusions. One result shows that the equilibrium recy-
</p>
<p>clability level can be higher under CPR than under IPR, which is in direct contrast 
</p>
<p>to Atasu and Subramanian ( 2012 ). The recyclability being higher under CPR tends 
</p>
<p>to happen when the collective system is formed by big fi rms. The underlying ratio-
</p>
<p>nale is that under CPR, free-riding issues are less severe for the partnership with big 
</p>
<p>fi rms. Moreover, producers benefi t from higher economies of scale. Therefore, the 
</p>
<p>equilibrium collection rate is higher, which then drives up the total return of the 
</p>
<p>recyclability investment (reduced processing cost for more units) and hence encour-
</p>
<p>ages better design. Another conclusion  points   out that although CPR appears to 
</p>
<p>facilitate economies of scale and hence should always lead to a higher collection 
</p>
<p>10 Operational Implications of Environmental Regulation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>248
</p>
<p>rate (i.e., higher degree of overcompliance), it is in fact possible to have a higher 
</p>
<p>collection rate under IPR than under CPR, especially when the collective system 
</p>
<p>consists of small fi rms. The reason is that in addition to economies of scale, better 
</p>
<p>designs can also induce more collection because when products are more recyclable 
</p>
<p>they become cheaper to process. However, when a fi rm is in a collective system with 
</p>
<p>other small fi rms, it bares the risk of being free-ridden and cannot retain the full 
</p>
<p>benefi t of design enhancements. As a result, it has lower design incentives than 
</p>
<p>when it acts alone. The negative effects of diminished design incentives can even 
</p>
<p>dominate the positive effects of processing at bulk and therefore results in a lower 
</p>
<p>overall collection rate under CPR. 
</p>
<p> Another insightful fi nding is that a fi rm may incur a higher cost when it joins a 
</p>
<p>collective system with other relatively smaller fi rms compared to when it collects 
</p>
<p>and recycles individually. In that case, if the fi rm pulls out of the collective system 
</p>
<p>and if the fi rm is big enough, then the compliance cost of the collective system goes 
</p>
<p>up. Note that these observations have important implications for supply chain man-
</p>
<p>agers. In particular, these results suggest that the reverse supply chain manager 
</p>
<p>needs to consider take-back compliance collaboration with other fi rms very strategi-
</p>
<p>cally. Depending on the type of compliance partners, a reverse supply chain man-
</p>
<p>ager may increase or decrease the reach of its collection programs and inform the 
</p>
<p>design/engineering department regarding the extent of take-back compliance cost 
</p>
<p>savings that can be achieved by improved designs. 
</p>
<p> The take-away from this study is that the coalition structure in a collective sys-
</p>
<p>tem is another operational detail that makes a difference in implementation. 
</p>
<p>Specifi cally, compliance behaviors of a producer in collection or product design can 
</p>
<p>vary signifi cantly depending on the relative size of the producer and those of the 
</p>
<p>other participants in the coalition. 
</p>
<p> In sum, Atasu and Subramanian ( 2012 ) and Esenduran and Kemahlioglu-Ziya 
</p>
<p>( 2015 ) collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of collective and indi-
</p>
<p>vidual models of producer responsibility in implementation.    Their results reveal 
</p>
<p>certain weaknesses associated with each model, and motivate the need for research 
</p>
<p>towards more powerful regulative tools for effi cient implementation. One natural 
</p>
<p>direction for such pursuit is to explore the possibility of integrating the most promi-
</p>
<p>nent advantages of the two models, namely, generating superior design incentives 
</p>
<p>and achieving cost-effi ciency. 
</p>
<p> As such, we start with the collective model as a base to seek potential improve-
</p>
<p>ments. First and foremost, note that the consolidation of end-of-life products, while 
</p>
<p>facilitating economies of scale, does not exclude the potential of a collective model 
</p>
<p>to properly internalize the associated processing costs for incentivizing eco-design. 
</p>
<p>Rather, the root of the problem actually resides in the cost allocation mechanism, 
</p>
<p>which is usually based on return share or market share. Such proportional cost allo-
</p>
<p>cations gain popularity among both scholars and regulators mainly due to their sim-
</p>
<p>plicity and transparency. However, they are not ideal solutions because they give 
</p>
<p>rise to the fi rst weakness of the collective model, which involves fairness and stabil-
</p>
<p>ity concerns. Producers who feel overcharged by a collective system may be driven 
</p>
<p>to break away and operate in an individual system instead. This jeopardizes the 
</p>
<p>X. Huang and A. Atasu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>249
</p>
<p>stability of the collective system, which is a prerequisite to sustain the scale advan-
</p>
<p>tage. This outcome is indeed observed in practice. One recent example is that in 
</p>
<p>Washington State, where a centrally run standard plan is in place with a statewide 
</p>
<p>collective system, some producers fi le requests for switching to self-operated inde-
</p>
<p>pendent plans with the belief that their stand alone cost will be lower. This is because 
</p>
<p> the   proportional cost allocation model employed by the collective system in 
</p>
<p>Washington State falls short of accounting for recycling cost heterogeneity across 
</p>
<p>producers. Note also that responsibility allocation problems are not unique to the 
</p>
<p>take-back regulation context. See Caro et al. ( 2013 ) and Sunar ( 2015 ) for similar 
</p>
<p>discussions in the emissions regulation context. 
</p>
<p> As such, a fi rst step towards building a more robust collective system starts with 
</p>
<p>a search for a cost allocation mechanism that accounts for product-specifi c metrics 
</p>
<p>to help achieve fairness in cost allocation and guarantee stability. Meanwhile, the 
</p>
<p>concrete operations of collection and recycling in a collective system are likely to 
</p>
<p>be conducted in a network where the end-of-life items from numerous producers are 
</p>
<p>processed by the aggregation of different recycling capacities. Consequently, the 
</p>
<p>cost allocation model to guarantee fairness and stability should also properly incor-
</p>
<p>porate  network   effects in a collective system. Gui et al. ( 2014a ) present a fruitful 
</p>
<p>attempt in this direction.  
</p>
<p>10.8      The Individual or the  Network  ? 
</p>
<p> Gui et al. ( 2014a ) study a set of producers that are faced with recycling standards 
</p>
<p>imposed by regulation. A  collection and recycling network (CRN)  , which effec-
</p>
<p>tively is a collaborative reverse supply chain, collectively handles all the end-of-life 
</p>
<p>products from producers. The network comprises of three sets of nodes that repre-
</p>
<p>sent the collection points, the consolidators, and the processors respectively. All 
</p>
<p>items go through one of each set of these nodes in sequence. The edges in the net-
</p>
<p>work stand for costly processes of collection, consolidation, processing, and the 
</p>
<p>transportation in-between. Product heterogeneity in the model is refl ected by differ-
</p>
<p>ent costs of processing the products of different producers. The collective system is 
</p>
<p>stable when a grand-coalition is formed and all producers choose to voluntarily stay 
</p>
<p>in the system. The system stability requires a fair cost allocation, which is defi ned 
</p>
<p>as one that ensures each producer to be better off by remaining in the grand- coalition. 
</p>
<p>If a producer can achieve lower cost outside the collective system, it will leave the 
</p>
<p>grand-coalition to operate individually or to form a sub-coalition with some of the 
</p>
<p>other producers. 
</p>
<p> The processing capacities in the network consist of capacities that are privately 
</p>
<p>owned (or contracted) by producers and capacities that are contracted by the central 
</p>
<p>authority who runs the grand-coalition. While the former type of capacities can be 
</p>
<p>used by any (grand- or sub-) coalition the owner producer belongs to, the latter can 
</p>
<p>only be used by the grand-coalition at no additional cost. The total cost incurred by 
</p>
<p>the collective system is calculated based on the socially optimal routing (i.e., the

</p>
<p>members in the system. 
</p>
<p> The paper develops a fair cost allocation model based on the prevalent return 
</p>
<p>share heuristic: The cost-corrected return share with capacity adjustment (hereafter 
</p>
<p>referred to as the dual-based cost allocation) makes two adjustments to the return 
</p>
<p>share-based cost allocation. The fi rst is that in deriving the return share, each pro-
</p>
<p>ducer&rsquo;s return volume at every collection point is weighted by the marginal cost of 
</p>
<p>processing its products. This adjustment refl ects the product heterogeneity in the 
</p>
<p>network. The second adjustment is to grant a reward to each producer for the valu-
</p>
<p>able capacities it contributes to the network, at a properly set unit reward price. 
</p>
<p> The study further shows that this cost allocation can be widely applicable and 
</p>
<p>retain fairness even when economies of scale enter the model, or when the central 
</p>
<p>authority- contracted   capacities are open at a fee to producers outside the grand- 
</p>
<p>coalition. These fi ndings are validated using the actual EPR implementation data 
</p>
<p>from Washington State. 
</p>
<p> This research once more highlights the importance of operational angle, this time 
</p>
<p>in the form of network effects under the collective model. Since the key character-
</p>
<p>istic of operations in a network is the pooling of available capacities for better utili-
</p>
<p>zation, the critical operational angle here is how resource sharing can be refl ected in 
</p>
<p>the cost allocation. Notably, the dual-based cost allocation, in addition to maintain-
</p>
<p>ing system stability, also shows potential to make up for another defi ciency of the 
</p>
<p>prevalent return share-based allocation. To be specifi c, the dual-based allocation can 
</p>
<p>help enhance the undermined design incentives in collective take-back regulation 
</p>
<p>implementations because it rewards the ease of recycling of products by accounting 
</p>
<p>for the product heterogeneity. Gui et al. ( 2014b ) dive into exploring this possibility, 
</p>
<p>and the result shows that not only the product design choices, but also the process 
</p>
<p>technology matters in a network setting. 
</p>
<p> In Gui et al. ( 2014b ), end-of-life product treatment is conducted collectively in a 
</p>
<p>network with a similar setting to the one in Gui et al. ( 2014a ). One crucial aspect of 
</p>
<p>the network confi guration highlighted in this paper is the differentiation in both 
</p>
<p>cost-effi ciency (i.e., process technology) and capacity of processors. When there are 
</p>
<p>suffi cient low-cost capabilities, cost synergy in the collective network is high 
</p>
<p>because the resource sharing in collection and recycling has a higher potential for 
</p>
<p>cost savings. In the network, product design improvements are also related to the 
</p>
<p>characteristics of the processors, because the benefi ts of design are mostly realized 
</p>
<p>through infl uencing the processing cost. Specifi cally, product design is a substitute 
</p>
<p>(complement) for process technology when the enhancement of recyclability leads 
</p>
<p>to higher (lower) cost reduction at the less effi cient processors. The paper focuses 
</p>
<p>on a collective system under a stable cost allocation, such as the dual-based cost 
</p>
<p>allocation that ensures the grand-coalition stability, and concludes the following: 
</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, a collective implementation, while having a cost advan-
</p>
<p>tage, can stimulate design incentives that are comparable or even superior to those 
</p>
<p>under an individual implementation. The conditions to achieve this environmentally 
</p>
<p>and economically desirable outcome are to have low (high)    cost synergy when 
</p>
<p>the product design and the process technology are substitutes (complements).

</p>
<p>When these conditions are not met, the tension between achieving cost-effi ciency 
</p>
<p>and creating design incentives is irreconcilable under a collective system. That is, a 
</p>
<p>collective system may not be both coalitionally stable (which facilitates economies 
</p>
<p>of scale) and strong in motivating product recyclable design at the same time. 
</p>
<p> This paper points out the importance of another operational detail: Understanding 
</p>
<p>the level of cost effi cient technology in a collective system network and its relation to 
</p>
<p>the product design is key to constructing effective regulation and successfully coping 
</p>
<p>with it. It also suggests that the reverse supply chain manager needs to weigh the value 
</p>
<p>of collection and recycling capacity investments or product design improvements it 
</p>
<p>may make for take-back compliance in the light of the existing collection and recycling 
</p>
<p>infrastructures. Such  systems   operated by other producers or statewide compliance 
</p>
<p>schemes and the availability of the technologies they leverage can signifi cantly infl u-
</p>
<p>ence the value-added from capacity investments or product design improvements.  
</p>
<p>10.9      Local Regulation or Global  Goals  ? 
</p>
<p> Another major concern in dealing with end-of-life products is their leakage from the 
</p>
<p>regulated work management systems due to exports: As end-of-life product waste is 
</p>
<p>costly to process, exporting the waste to developing areas such as Africa and Asia 
</p>
<p>may become an attractive option to producers. The processing costs in these areas 
</p>
<p>are typically much lower due to the lack of stringent processing requirements and 
</p>
<p>the availability of cheap labor. Obviously, this is bad news for the exporting area 
</p>
<p>because when the waste leakage is not properly handled, the effectiveness of regula-
</p>
<p>tion in meeting the environmental objectives is seriously undermined. On the other 
</p>
<p>hand, mishandled waste poses an acute hazard to the health and environment in the 
</p>
<p>destination areas of waste export. Note also that such global leakages of environ-
</p>
<p>mental externalities are not unique to the take-back context. Similar observations 
</p>
<p>have been made for emissions leakage as well (see Sunar  2015 ; Drake and Just 
</p>
<p> 2015 ; Islegen et al.  2015 ). 
</p>
<p> In view of this real threat that has already been observed in the practice of elec-
</p>
<p>tronics recycling (e.g., documented in BAN  2005 ), the European Union has ratifi ed 
</p>
<p>the Basel Convention, which is an export restriction that prohibits export of end-of- 
</p>
<p>life products. Nevertheless, although dumping waste is unacceptable, the export of 
</p>
<p>used but still functioning products to developing countries may be allowed. The 
</p>
<p>rationale is that exporting functional used products can be a win&ndash;win solution. It 
</p>
<p>helps manage the unwanted items in the developed country and provides people in 
</p>
<p>a developing country with affordable access to used products. This forms the foun-
</p>
<p>dation for what we call partial export restrictions, under which used products in 
</p>
<p>working condition are permitted for export while end-of-life products are not. A 
</p>
<p>similar example is the introduction of the  Responsible Electronics Recycling Act in 
</p>
<p>US Congress   in 2011 (Kyle  2011 ). 
</p>
<p> Some NGOs, such as the Basel Action Network, however, argue that it may be 
</p>
<p>benefi cial to ban exports of even used products, i.e., a full export restriction. As we 
</p>
<p>10 Operational Implications of Environmental Regulation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>252
</p>
<p>compare the partial export restriction to the full export restriction, we have to keep in 
</p>
<p>mind that producers may utilize the used products pulled off the  secondary   mar-
</p>
<p>ket along with the end-of-life products to fulfi ll the recovery obligation as aforemen-
</p>
<p>tioned. Then allowing used products with remaining lifespans to be exported may 
</p>
<p>accentuate this type of secondary interference that has been shown to be environmen-
</p>
<p>tally unfavorable. Therefore, the problem becomes of concern that how do different 
</p>
<p>stringencies in export regulation (none, partial or full restriction) differ in terms of 
</p>
<p>environmental performance. This problem is addressed in Alev et al. ( 2014a ). 
</p>
<p> In Alev et al. ( 2014a ), the setup and assumptions for this problem are the same 
</p>
<p>as in the main model exhibited earlier. When products are exported from the devel-
</p>
<p>oped country to a developing country, the associated unit recycling cost is reduced 
</p>
<p>to refl ect the lower cost in the developing country due to cheaper labor or lower 
</p>
<p>processing stringency requirements. The authors then compare the partial and the 
</p>
<p>full export restrictions, while the former forbids the export of end-of-life products, 
</p>
<p>the latter forbids the export of both end-of-life and used products. 
</p>
<p> The fi rst fi nding in Alev et al. ( 2014a ) is that when compared to the case with no 
</p>
<p>export restriction, under a full export restriction, the reuse level is higher and the new 
</p>
<p>production volume is smaller in the developed country. This result substantiates the 
</p>
<p>need for closing the door for the export of products from the developed country&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>perspective, because preventing the export of both used or end-of-life items reduces 
</p>
<p>a producer&rsquo;s incentive for secondary market interference. The result of a partial export 
</p>
<p>restriction, on the other hand, is surprising. Intuitively, we expect that the partial 
</p>
<p>export restriction should partially attain the benefi ts of a full restriction. However, a 
</p>
<p>partial restriction may lead to even worse outcomes. To be specifi c, with a partial 
</p>
<p>export restriction, the reuse level may be lower and the total production may increase 
</p>
<p>in the developed country. Moreover, the developing country that receives exports may 
</p>
<p>suffer from the environmental consequences of a higher export volume. 
</p>
<p> These results once more show that the lack of understanding the operational 
</p>
<p>mechanisms that underlie producer incentives can compromise the regulation effec-
</p>
<p>tiveness; not only  in   the developed economies where take-back regulation is enacted, 
</p>
<p>but also in developing economies importing used products. The detail that critically 
</p>
<p>matters in this case is that reverse supply chains for compliance can in fact have two 
</p>
<p>destinations for recycling, namely, domestic and international. Overlooking the 
</p>
<p>international export as a way to deal with end-of-life obligation can create loopholes 
</p>
<p>in export  restriction   mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>10.10     Conclusion: The Devil in the Details 
</p>
<p> In this chapter, we reviewed a series of operations management papers dealing with 
</p>
<p>take-back regulation implementations to discuss a broad spectrum of possible issues 
</p>
<p>that may arise in crafting of and complying with environmental regulation. This 
</p>
<p>review suggests that the supply chain challenges associated with environmental 
</p>
<p>regulation may particularly be driven by policy implementation decisions, often 
</p>
<p>because of certain assumptions based on abstraction of environmental problems and 
</p>
<p>X. Huang and A. Atasu</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>253
</p>
<p>industrial dynamics: Even basic assumptions that are intuitive, sound and applicable 
</p>
<p>in general circumstances may in fact not hold due to various reasons. These may 
</p>
<p>include technology or commodity market dynamics, differences across the regu-
</p>
<p>lated industries, nature of the products of interest, or less obvious but valid alterna-
</p>
<p>tive responses for producers under regulation. 
</p>
<p> In turn, these observations suggest that successful design of and compliance with 
</p>
<p>environmental regulation can only be possible with careful implementation choices 
</p>
<p>that account for the devil in the details. This insight emphasizes the merits and impor-
</p>
<p>tance of taking a supply chain perspective in the context of environmental regulation. 
</p>
<p>We posit that for environmental regulation to achieve its goals, it must account for its 
</p>
<p>infl uence on the operational decisions of all stakeholders involved, especially those 
</p>
<p>who are directly targeted by the regulation, e.g., producers and their supply chains. In 
</p>
<p>other words, an operational lens appears to be a key instrument in defi ning appropriate 
</p>
<p>implementation structures for environmental regulations and responding to the ground 
</p>
<p>rules they impose. It is critical that supply chain managers understand the details of 
</p>
<p>take-back policies as they are often not what they appear to be on the surface. 
</p>
<p> As environmental regulation gains momentum, it will inevitably have to deal with 
</p>
<p>more problems emerging from a wider scope of fi elds. To triumph in these new chal-
</p>
<p>lenges calls for more supply chain research in different directions. Looking again at 
</p>
<p>the take-back regulation, although extensive work already exists as discussed, its 
</p>
<p>continuous development may still give rise to new questions to be answered. One 
</p>
<p>instance is that, as recycling activities fl ourish, encouraged by the more stringent 
</p>
<p>recovery targets, an increasing number of entities are entering the recycling indus-
</p>
<p>tries to share the pie and make profi t. To ensure regulatory effectiveness in promot-
</p>
<p>ing environmentally superior treatment of end-of-life products, current regulation on 
</p>
<p>recycling standards may need to be modifi ed and extended to also cover these recy-
</p>
<p>clers. As demonstrated by research studies considered in this chapter, crafting more 
</p>
<p>effi cient regulation will require a thorough understanding of the operational details 
</p>
<p>involved. The same is also true for other forms of environmental regulation, such as 
</p>
<p>the  RoHS and the REACH   (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction 
</p>
<p>of Chemicals) Directives of the European Union that regulate the use of certain sub-
</p>
<p>stances and chemicals, and the variety of emission regulations around the globe. In 
</p>
<p>particular, the emission issues have a wide range of infl uence because pollutants can 
</p>
<p>transport to other areas easily. As a result, dealing with emission problems may 
</p>
<p>involve extensive collaboration and coordination between various supply chain 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and lead to different operational problems.

<p> Responsible Purchasing: Moving

<p>from Compliance to Value Creation

</p>
<p>11.1          Introduction 
</p>
<p>11.1.1     Why Responsible Purchasing? 
</p>
<p> An increasing number of companies are intertwined with a large number of suppli-
</p>
<p>ers. Suppliers are increasingly important for the competitive advantage of the 
</p>
<p> buying company, as the latter is relying on the innovative and quality-enhancing 
</p>
<p>capabilities of its suppliers to reduce costs and improve time to market (Matthyssens 
</p>
<p>and Faes  2013 ). However, this relationship creates a high dependency of the buying 
</p>
<p>company on its business critical suppliers, making buying companies extremely 
</p>
<p>vulnerable for irregularities in their supply chain. 
</p>
<p> Boeing&rsquo;s Dreamliner may serve here as an example. The fi rst Dreamliner was 
</p>
<p>delivered in September 2011 to All Nippon Airways, 3.5 years behind schedule. 
</p>
<p>There were many reasons for this signifi cant delay. First, the large number of new 
</p>
<p>technologies (e.g., new composites for body parts, new electronics for customer 
</p>
<p>entertainment and climate control) resulted in many problems. Next, Boeing&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p> complex global supply chain design represented an even greater challenge (Tang 
</p>
<p>et al.  2009 ). Parts were sourced from specialized suppliers worldwide. The orches-
</p>
<p>tration of the parts among the supply partners and Boeing seemed an impossible 
</p>
<p>job. Next, it was no surprise that the fi rst planes showed signifi cant failures

</p>
<p>(ranging from cockpit windshield crack, to overheated batteries and even interior 
</p>
<p>fi res). When mismanagement takes place in a wrong supply chain design involving 
</p>
<p>monopolistic and specialized business critical suppliers, the consequences will 
</p>
<p>both hit the supplier, the buying company, and the end-consumer. In addition, 
</p>
<p> sustainability risks arise with these global supply chain complexities following 
</p>
<p>from unforeseen  supplier malpractices. This results in supply chain interruptions 
</p>
<p>and reputation damage. 
</p>
<p> Supplier relationships clearly pose new challenges in terms of  transparency and 
</p>
<p>traceability  . Therefore, it is time for companies to address these challenges and take 
</p>
<p>sustainability criteria into account in their purchasing practices. Principles regard-
</p>
<p>ing ethics, safety, and diversity should be supported in order to benefi t the fi rm, 
</p>
<p>supply chain, and society. Support for these principles should be demanded from 
</p>
<p>the suppliers&rsquo; suppliers as well. However, demanding compliance is one challenge, 
</p>
<p>creating shared value in the supply chain is quite another challenge. The latter 
</p>
<p>requires an orientation towards responsible purchasing, i.e., a (governance) process 
</p>
<p>of creating more transparency, education, collaborative partnerships, and of imple-
</p>
<p>menting sustainability practices. Doing so effectively will take time and efforts as 
</p>
<p>companies will move through different stages of maturity. 
</p>
<p> In this chapter, we argue that responsible rather than sustainable purchasing is 
</p>
<p>needed to support the company&rsquo;s overall business strategy. These two concepts are 
</p>
<p>detailed in the following section.  
</p>
<p>11.1.2     Responsible vs. Sustainable Purchasing 2  
</p>
<p> Corporate social responsibility (CSR) relates to an organization&rsquo;s responsibility to 
</p>
<p>meet the present needs of its various stakeholders  without   jeopardizing the future 
</p>
<p>needs of these stakeholders (Brundtland  1987 ). Other authors have referred to CSR 
</p>
<p>as the economic, legal, environmental, ethical, and philanthropic expectations that 
</p>
<p>society has of organizations at any given point in time (Carroll  1991 ). In line with 
</p>
<p>these defi nitions, we defi ne sustainable purchasing as: &ldquo;the supply of all goods, 
</p>
<p>services, capabilities and knowledge which are necessary for running, maintaining 
</p>
<p>and managing the organization&rsquo;s primary and support activities secured at the most 
</p>
<p>sustainable conditions.&rdquo; Sustainability refers to economic, legal, ethical, and 
</p>
<p> philanthropic aspects in relationships with suppliers. We differentiate between 
</p>
<p> sustainable purchasing and responsible purchasing, as the latter would require a dif-
</p>
<p>ferent mentality and orientation from purchasing professionals. Sustainable pur-
</p>
<p>chasing includes designing and implementing procedures and guidelines, based on 
</p>
<p>external standards, aimed at fostering sustainable supplier relationships. Responsible 
</p>
<p>purchasing implies that purchasing professionals take it as their personal, rather 
</p>
<p>than their company&rsquo;s, responsibility to secure that these principles are implemented. 
</p>
<p>Whereas sustainable purchasing refers to the institutional responsibility, i.e., corpo-
</p>
<p>rate responsibility, responsible purchasing is refl ected by the adoption of 
</p>
<p>2   Responsible Purchasing equals in this chapter Green Purchasing, Environmentally Preferable 
</p>
<p>Sourcing, Green Sourcing.

</p>
<p>sustainability in the daily activities of purchasing professionals based upon their 
</p>
<p>own personal, ethical, and professional standards. 
</p>
<p> Responsible purchasing does not only look at the effects of supplier relationships 
</p>
<p>on company fi nancial results, risks, and reputation. Rather, it also includes design-
</p>
<p>ing and implementing supply chain solutions that are benefi cial not only for the 
</p>
<p>company, but also for the world around us. This connotation of purchasing is in line 
</p>
<p>with stakeholder theory as suggested by Freeman ( 1984 ), who argues that an orga-
</p>
<p>nization should not only satisfy the interests of their shareholders, but also the inter-
</p>
<p>ests of other stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, employees, regulatory 
</p>
<p>agencies, competitors, consumer advocacy groups, and media. This connotation 
</p>
<p>also aligns with what Porter and Kramer ( 2011 ) referred to as shared value creation. 
</p>
<p>Implementing sustainable purchasing is already a massive task. The step to imple-
</p>
<p>ment  responsible   purchasing is even greater.  
</p>
<p>11.1.3     Objectives and Structure of the Chapter 
</p>
<p> Our focus in this chapter is on large (multinational) companies that source  products . 
</p>
<p>The objective of this chapter is to show what it takes to go to diffi cult and trouble-
</p>
<p>some route to drive CSR in supplier, i.e., supply chain relationships. We discuss 
</p>
<p>some important CSR adoption models for large multinational companies (MNCs). 
</p>
<p>This knowledge will enable companies to design a roadmap towards integrated, 
</p>
<p>responsible supply chain practices. Implementing this roadmap comes with signifi -
</p>
<p>cant challenges. Therefore, we end with some critical issues and questions for com-
</p>
<p>panies to refl ect on, when taking the journey towards responsible purchasing and 
</p>
<p>supply chain practices. However, before doing so we position our paper by discuss-
</p>
<p>ing three relevant theoretical perspectives for our discussion. 
</p>
<p> The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. We start by presenting three different 
</p>
<p>approaches for value creation at the fi rm level in Sect.  11.2 . We show that the traditional 
</p>
<p>resource-based view has been supplemented by the resource dependence theory and the 
</p>
<p>stakeholder theory. In Sect.  11.3 , we review several approaches to CSR in the supply 
</p>
<p>chain as well as the programs and methods to drive sustainability in supply chain rela-
</p>
<p>tionships. Section  11.4  is devoted to the presentation of a time- phased model for respon-
</p>
<p>sible purchasing adoption. These concepts are compared to practice in Sect.  11.5  through 
</p>
<p>several examples. Section  11.6  presents some challenges related to sustainable supplier 
</p>
<p>relationships. Finally, Sect.  11.7  is devoted to conclusions and suggestions.   
</p>
<p>11.2      From the Resource-Based View to Stakeholder Theory 3  
</p>
<p> Shareholder value creation has dominated management theory and business prac-
</p>
<p>tices for decades. The purpose of the fi rm was to create maximum wealth for its 
</p>
<p>owners, i.e., its shareholders. In doing so, the fi rm should use and capitalize on its

</p>
<p>resources, i.e., the combination of technology, assets, knowledge, fi nancial 
</p>
<p>resources, and expertise. For a long time, the resource-based view was positioned as 
</p>
<p>the most dominant research paradigm in strategic management (Wernerfelt  1984 ). 
</p>
<p>The  resource-based view   suggests that a fi rm&rsquo;s unique resources, its competences to 
</p>
<p>deploy those resources, and its capabilities that are derived from bundled resources 
</p>
<p>provide a source for growth and competitive advantage (Rumelt  1984 ; Wernerfelt 
</p>
<p> 1984 ). Possessing and having access to valuable, rare, inimitable, and non- 
</p>
<p>substitutable resources would provide competitive advantages in itself, according to 
</p>
<p>these researchers. However, other researchers suggest that value is created only 
</p>
<p>when these resources are evaluated, manipulated, and deployed appropriately 
</p>
<p>within the fi rm&rsquo;s environmental context. Resources thus require a purpose in order 
</p>
<p>to be successfully structured, bundled, and leveraged. Purpose and value is given to 
</p>
<p>a fi rm&rsquo;s resources through directing them with an external orientation (Sirmon et al. 
</p>
<p> 2007 ). An external orientation allows fi rms to leverage capabilities and resources in 
</p>
<p>such a way that they fi t to their context and are considered valuable. This approach 
</p>
<p>is called  resource management   (Sirmon et al.  2007 ,  2008 ). 
</p>
<p> The resource-based view, however, is in essence internally oriented and does 
</p>
<p>only implicitly embed supplier resources and capabilities in the process of structur-
</p>
<p>ing, bundling, and leveraging resources to obtain competitiveness. It remains 
</p>
<p>unclear about how to adopt the proposed external orientation, which is necessary to 
</p>
<p>create suffi cient &ldquo;fi t&rdquo; with the fi rm&rsquo;s environment, i.e., its multiple stakeholders. 
</p>
<p> Therefore, other researchers have suggested that rather than internal resources, 
</p>
<p>the way the fi rm needs to deal with its external resources, i.e., its external dependen-
</p>
<p>cies, is important in order to achieve competitive advantage. The central proposition 
</p>
<p>in the  resource dependence theory   is that fi rms change as well as negotiate with their 
</p>
<p>external environment in order to secure access to the resources, which they need in 
</p>
<p>order to survive (Pfeffer and Salancik  1978 ). The resource dependency theory 
</p>
<p>thereby typically looks beyond the boundaries of an individual fi rm. The resource 
</p>
<p>dependence theory advocates that information generation and intelligence on the 
</p>
<p>environment are key for creating fi rm awareness and fi rm responsiveness to stake-
</p>
<p>holder demands (Handfi eld  1993 ; Pfeffer and Salancik  1978 ). Next it argues that 
</p>
<p>fi rms are not self-contained in fulfi lling demands and therefore need to establish 
</p>
<p>effective linkages with suppliers to access resources and capabilities required to 
</p>
<p>deliver value (Pfeffer and Salancik  1978 ; Ulrich and Barney  1984 ). Hence, this the-
</p>
<p>ory argues that a fi rm&rsquo;s success is particularly refl ected in the  external  evaluation of 
</p>
<p>the fi rm&rsquo;s performance (Christensen and Bower  1996 ; Pfeffer and Salancik  1978 ). 
</p>
<p>The resource dependence theory implies that suppliers are necessary for adapting to 
</p>
<p>and anticipating on the developments in the supply chain&rsquo;s environment. Developing 
</p>
<p>effective relationships with the most qualifi ed suppliers seems to be a prerequisite to 
</p>
<p>secure the external resources, which are required to create customer value creation 
</p>
<p>and, hence, foster the fi rm&rsquo;s competitiveness (Pfeffer and Salancik  1978 ). 
</p>
<p> The  resource dependence theory   is explicit about the purpose of the fi rm: satisfy-
</p>
<p>ing external stakeholders, i.e., customers, investors, and other organizations that are 
</p>
<p>affected by the fi rm (Christensen and Bower  1996 ). This idea is acknowledged and 
</p>

<p/>

<p>261
</p>
<p>elaborated on by stakeholder theory. Stakeholder theory suggests that each stake-
</p>
<p>holder represents different values that the focal fi rm should try to realize (Donaldson 
</p>
<p>and Preston  1995 ; Freeman  1984 ; Freeman et al.  2007 ). The aim of stakeholder 
</p>
<p>theory is to satisfy a broad array of stakeholder groups based on their specifi c 
</p>
<p>demands. Creating value for different stakeholders has an effect on the way fi rms 
</p>
<p>allocate their resources through adopting different stakeholder orientations; fi rms 
</p>
<p>may create the proper attitudes and behaviors for satisfying its stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>achieving superior fi rm performance simultaneously. Stakeholder orientations 
</p>
<p>result in fi rm competitiveness because focus on stakeholder satisfaction allows a 
</p>
<p>fi rm to develop trusting relationships with their stakeholders, giving these fi rms the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to deal better with changes in the environment and consequently spur 
</p>
<p>innovation (Freeman et al.  2007 ; Harrison et al.  2010 ). 
</p>
<p> A stakeholder can be &ldquo;any group or individual who can affect or is affected by 
</p>
<p>the achievement of the organization&rsquo;s objectives&rdquo; (Freeman  1984 ). These include, 
</p>
<p>for instance, employees, communities, customers, political groups, investors, 
</p>
<p> governments, suppliers, and trade associations. Even though it may be diffi cult to 
</p>
<p>classify stakeholders, it seems that the stakeholder view is especially useful for 
</p>
<p>refl ecting resource-based considerations, market considerations, and socio-political 
</p>
<p>considerations simultaneously. When we adopt this perspective, suppliers should 
</p>
<p>not only create value to the fi rm&rsquo;s markets (customers), but also to society (all stake-
</p>
<p>holders representing social and environmental concerns) and to those who did 
</p>
<p>invest fi nancial resources in the fi rm (shareholders, investors). 
</p>
<p> In conclusion, the resource-based view of the fi rm, the resource dependence 
</p>
<p>theory, and stakeholder theory each emphasize a different element of how fi rms 
</p>
<p>may create value through supply chain cooperation. The resource-based view of the 
</p>
<p>fi rm is more concerned with the management of a fi rm&rsquo;s internal resources and 
</p>
<p>capabilities that may satisfy external stakeholders of the fi rm. In the resource depen-
</p>
<p>dence theory, the fi rm&rsquo;s dependence on other external parties, such as suppliers, is 
</p>
<p>central. Finally, the stakeholder theory focuses on the diverse stakeholder perspec-
</p>
<p>tives a fi rm needs to balance, weigh, and respond to. It argues that for achieving 
</p>
<p>competitive advantage, a fi rm and its supply chain partners should create in parallel 
</p>
<p>customer value, societal value, and shareholder value (Porter and Kramer  2011 ). 
</p>
<p>Chapter   21     by Sodhi and Tang ( 2017 ) provides further discussion of the stakeholder 
</p>
<p>resource-based view in the context of social responsibility.  
</p>
<p>11.3        CSR Models and Approaches in Large Companies 
</p>
<p> There are several approaches to  CSR   in the supply chain, all having a (slightly) dif-
</p>
<p>ferent focus. Some  CSR   models differentiate between companies, on the basis of, 
</p>
<p>for example, sectors (e.g., food, energy, commodities), value chain position 
</p>
<p>(upstream vs. downstream), or size (large enterprises vs. SMEs). In this section, we 
</p>
<p>briefl y discuss some important CSR models for large (multinational) companies and 
</p>
<p>show their importance for the supply chain and purchasing function.

</p>
<p> Most CSR models for large companies focus on the steps that are needed to inte-
</p>
<p>grate sustainability in the different functions. Several models also focus on the prac-
</p>
<p>tices that are needed outside the company to create a transparent sustainable supply 
</p>
<p>chain. Various CSR models have determined certain stages of maturity in the imple-
</p>
<p>mentation of sustainability practices in the organization and its value chain. For 
</p>
<p>example, Zadek ( 2004 ) has identifi ed fi ve stages organizations typically go through 
</p>
<p>when developing a sense of corporate responsibility, as they move along the learn-
</p>
<p>ing curve: defensive, compliance, managerial, strategic, and civil. In addition, 
</p>
<p>research from Van Tulder and Van der Zwart ( 2006 ) has distinguished between 
</p>
<p>passive, reactive, active, and proactive approaches of organizations to CSR. Also 
</p>
<p>Nidumolu et al. ( 2009 ) have  established   several stages in the adoption process of 
</p>
<p>CSR for organizations. This model is a good representation of the  adoption process   
</p>
<p>of CSR. Consequently, we provide more information about this model in Box  11.1 . 
</p>
<p>  Box 11.1 Stages in the Adoption of CSR by Organizations 
</p>
<p> According to Nidumolu et al. ( 2009 ),  sustainability   is the key driver of orga-
</p>
<p>nizational and technological innovations that  create   competitive advantage 
</p>
<p>and lower costs in the supply chain. Based on 30 case studies, they have dis-
</p>
<p>covered fi ve stages of change that organizations go through on the &ldquo;march to 
</p>
<p>sustainability,&rdquo; each stage creating opportunities and requiring new capabili-
</p>
<p>ties to deal with challenges (see Fig.  11.2 ). 
</p>
<p>  Stage 1  :   Viewing compliance as an opportunity &mdash;Being the fi rst to adopt 
</p>
<p>emerging laws allows companies more time to experiment with creative solu-
</p>
<p>tions and discover new business opportunities. It may also reduce costs as one 
</p>
<p>single chain is required for all markets, rather than having to adapt it to the 
</p>
<p>variations of each set of regulations. 
</p>
<p>  Stage 2: Making value chains sustainable &mdash;Once companies have learned 
</p>
<p>to keep pace with regulation, they become more proactive about sustainability 
</p>
<p>and in particular about environmental issues such as resource use. Initially, 
</p>
<p>this helps the company&rsquo;s image, but down the line it also helps to reduce costs 
</p>
<p>and create new businesses. 
</p>
<p>  Stage 3: Designing sustainable products and services &mdash;An improved sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain management allows a company to take a closer look at  their   product 
</p>
<p>structures and redesign them to meet customer concerns and examine the 
</p>
<p>products&rsquo; life cycles. 
</p>
<p>  Stage 4: Developing new business &mdash;New business models provide alterna-
</p>
<p>tives to the current way of doing business while succeeding in the value delivery 
</p>
<p>to the customer. These often materialize in collaborations with other companies 
</p>
<p>like when FedEx integrated their chain over that of Kinko&rsquo;s so that documents 
</p>
<p>would no longer have to be shipped, but could be printed on location. 
</p>
<p>  Stage 5: Creating next-practice platforms &mdash;Corporations move from look-
</p>
<p>ing for ways to deliver value that are compatible with CSR and sustainability, 
</p>
<p> to   make sustainability the main tenant through which business models are 
</p>
<p>created (Fig.  11.1 ).

</p>
<p> These and other CSR models consider  sustainability   as a key driver of innova-
</p>
<p>tion and of benefi ts in terms of people, planet, and profi t. As we have argued, 
</p>
<p>sustainability is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for existing business mod-
</p>
<p>els to remain competitive. Successful sustainability strategies should integrate 
</p>
<p>ethical, operational, relational, and co-marketing approaches (Matthyssens and 
</p>
<p>Faes  2013 ). In addition, they require collaboration between different functions, 
</p>
<p>such as research and development (R&amp;D), logistics, purchasing, marketing, and 
</p>
<p>sales. Particularly, purchasing departments should take the lead in driving sustain-
</p>
<p>ability through the organization, given the importance of suppliers due to the tre-
</p>
<p>mendous outsourcing practices of current MNCs and the inherent carbon footprint 
</p>
<p>of upstream supply chains. In addition, the models show that monitoring and 
</p>
<p>evaluation (M&amp;E) are important aspects for the management of sustainability in 
</p>
<p>large companies. The transparency in sustainability performance resulting from 
</p>
<p>M&amp;E does not only benefi t the company&rsquo;s reputation in relation to critical exter-
</p>
<p>nal parties, such as non- governmental organizations (NGOs), consumer action 
</p>
<p>groups, public sector actors, and customers that have called upon the business 
</p>
<p>sector to act more responsibly. It also serves as an internal driver for employees 
</p>
<p>and stakeholders in the supply chain. Transparency and an improved sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity reputation seem to have a positive effect on the employees&rsquo; and supply chain 
</p>
<p>partners&rsquo; motivation (Matthyssens and Faes  2013 ). Further discussion on how 
</p>
<p>fi rms can use a &ldquo;sense and response&rdquo; framework to improve social and environ-
</p>
<p>mental performance in their supply chains is provided by Lee and Rammohan 
</p>
<p>( 2017 ) in Chap.   20    . 
</p>
<p>  In order to create  transparency   in the sustainability domain, large companies 
</p>
<p>report on indicators that are derived from the external indices such as the Dow 
</p>
<p>Jones Sustainability Index and the Global Reporting Initiative. 4  In their reports, 
</p>
<p>these institutions use a wide range of indicators to measure CSR progress and per-
</p>
<p>formance. Examples of indicators are the way in which the company is managed 
</p>
<p>(i.e., its corporate governance), risk and crisis management, ethical codes that are 
</p>
<p>present within the organization, the way in which the company tries to improve 
</p>
<p>eco-effi ciency and reduce carbon footprint, fuel effi ciency, labor conditions, and 
</p>
<p>social reporting. 
</p>
<p>  Large buying corporations   could take a leadership role by infl uencing the CSR 
</p>
<p>policies of their (current) suppliers. More and more MNCs are aware of this so- 
</p>
<p>called &ldquo;responsibility for sustainability stewardship.&rdquo; They integrate sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity indicators in the supplier selection process to carefully select suppliers on their 
</p>
<p>current sustainability performance and their potential and willingness to comply 
</p>
<p>with the sustainability policy of the buying company in order to prevent certain 
</p>
<p>suppliers for being excluded, such as smallholders. In addition, companies recog-
</p>
<p>nize the value of local sourcing, including small and diverse businesses that can

<p> These programs and methods may be used to create  a   common approach towards 
</p>
<p>sustainability in the supply chain. In order to increase the compliance and engage-
</p>
<p>ment of suppliers, stakeholder meetings and supplier development programs are 
</p>
<p>organized by the buying company. Buyer-imposed standards and practices may fos-
</p>
<p>ter innovation within the supplier&rsquo;s organization, which will result in a direct benefi t 
</p>
<p>for the supply chain, including the buying company, to serve its customers and 
</p>
<p>society. 5  Therefore, an increasing number of sustainability indices also take the sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain performance into account when assigning a sustainability score to a 
</p>
<p> company. An example is the ISO 26000 guideline that provides indicators for com-
</p>
<p>panies to make  their   supply chain more sustainable. 
</p>
<p>11.4         Adopting Responsible Purchasing: A Time Phased 
</p>
<p>Model 
</p>
<p> In the previous section, we discussed programs and methods to drive sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity in supply chain relationships. These programs and methods are not used by all 
</p>
<p>companies all of the time. On the contrary, as we observe from company prac-
</p>
<p>tices, companies seem to go through a growth path in adopting these tools and 
</p>
<p>techniques and in developing responsible purchasing. This growth path is in line 
</p>
<p>with the growth path that companies need at corporate levels to adopt sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity as a concept as discussed in Sect.  11.3  in the model of Nidumolu et al. 
</p>
<p>(Nidumolu et al.  2009 ). However, as our previous research shows, 6  there seems to 
</p>
<p>be a time lag between the adoption of sustainability at the corporate, i.e., company 
</p>
<p>5   &ldquo;Creating value in supply chains : supplier&rsquo;s impact on the value for customers, society and share-
</p>
<p>holders&rdquo; Kibbeling, M.I. (2010) Ph.D. dissertation, Eindhoven University of Technology. The rea-
</p>
<p>son why CSR drives innovation in supply chain relationships is that imposing CSR requirements 
</p>
<p>on incumbent suppliers reduces their product and process solution space. In order to fi t the buyer&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>smaller solution space new products and process solutions are necessary.

<p>267
</p>
<p>level, and at the purchasing, i.e., supply chain level. We suggest that the following 
</p>
<p>stages mark the adoption of sustainability in supply chain relationships: 
</p>
<p>  Stage I :   Denial   &mdash;As the company has not integrated sustainability in its business 
</p>
<p>strategy, purchasing is traditionally cost-driven in its supply chain relationships. 
</p>
<p>Suppliers are selected based on the lowest price, i.e., total cost of ownership. 
</p>
<p>Supplier codes of conduct and business integrity codes are usually not present. The 
</p>
<p>dominant view at the board level is that adopting CSR will increase cost and com-
</p>
<p>plexity. CSR practices are adopted as long as the balance between extra revenues 
</p>
<p>and extra costs incurred is positive. 
</p>
<p>  Stage II :   Opportunism &mdash;Here the   company expresses sustainability as a prime 
</p>
<p>concern in its public advertising and marketing. However, it is not integrated in its 
</p>
<p>business strategy and operations. Hence, ideas and concepts covering sustainability 
</p>
<p>are not cascaded down to the purchasing department and supply relationships. 
</p>
<p>Hence, there is little difference with the previous stage. The board starts to think 
</p>
<p>about CSR as a concept to foster its customer reputation and to counterattack 
</p>
<p>assaults from external parties. Individual ad hoc CSR initiatives are highlighted and 
</p>
<p>overexposed in company advertising and brochures. 
</p>
<p>  Stage III :   Compliance to the law &mdash;As the   company has faced some diffi culties 
</p>
<p>on sustainability issues with the external world, the board of directors has become 
</p>
<p>sensitive to the company&rsquo;s risk profi le. Hence, business managers are instructed not 
</p>
<p>to violate any social laws or environmental laws in the areas in which they operate. 
</p>
<p>The fi rst training and awareness programs are designed at a corporate level, follow-
</p>
<p>ing a typical top-down approach. These programs, however, have not trickled down 
</p>
<p>to the purchasing and supply operations yet. Occasionally, purchasing may have 
</p>
<p>introduced an integrity code to its suppliers. At this stage, purchasing is still passive, 
</p>
<p>traditional, and cost-driven. 
</p>
<p>  Stage IV :  Sustainability as a driver for lower cost &mdash;At this stage, due to a number 
</p>
<p>of consulting assignments  and   studies within the company, the board of  directors has 
</p>
<p>become aware that pursuing sustainability in its operations might drive down the 
</p>
<p>costs, fostering internal motivation for sustainability. When energy  consumption is 
</p>
<p>decreased overall, the company&rsquo;s carbon footprint will go down resulting in lower 
</p>
<p>energy bills. Internally, energy saving programs show great results and new solutions. 
</p>
<p>As the company is aware of its high external cost, initiatives trickle down to the pur-
</p>
<p>chasing department to pursue similar programs in supply chain relationships. This 
</p>
<p>leads to specifi c sourcing programs aimed at reducing energy costs and carbon foot-
</p>
<p>print at suppliers. In addition, procurement managers start to set up  supplier   sustain-
</p>
<p>ability audits to make suppliers comply with social and environmental regulations. 
</p>
<p>  Stage V :  Sustainability as a driver for product and business innovation &mdash;At this 
</p>
<p>stage, the company has experienced that driving sustainability  in   its company oper-
</p>
<p>ations leads to new products, processes, and customer solutions. Imposing CSR 
</p>
<p>requirements on incumbent suppliers changes their product and process solution 
</p>
<p>space. In order to fi t the buyer&rsquo;s smaller solution space, new products and process 
</p>
<p>solutions are necessary. Suppliers are invited to discover better sustainable solu-
</p>
<p>tions to enable less energy consuming products and processes. As a result, supplier 
</p>
<p>relationships change from being competitive to more collaborative. Suppliers are 
</p>
<p>11 Responsible Purchasing: Moving from Compliance to Value Creation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>268
</p>
<p>urged to transfer sustainability requirements to their next-level suppliers. The board 
</p>
<p>monitors progress on specifi c supply chain sustainability initiatives. CSR perfor-
</p>
<p>mance measures, next to traditional cost and savings measures, make up the pro-
</p>
<p>curement organization&rsquo;s dashboard. 
</p>
<p>  Stage VI :  From corporate social responsibility to creating shared value &mdash;At this 
</p>
<p>stage, sustainability is fully integrated into the  company&rsquo;s   business and supply chain 
</p>
<p>strategy and operations. Over time, the change of the company&rsquo;s philosophy has led to 
</p>
<p>a reduction of the number of supply chain relationships and towards more transparent 
</p>
<p>and collaborative partnerships with suppliers. There is an active exchange of ideas and 
</p>
<p>best practices between both the company and its key business- critical suppliers about 
</p>
<p>how to grow profi table and even more sustainable business in the future, while at the 
</p>
<p>same time reducing carbon footprint and creating value for all stakeholders. Procurement 
</p>
<p>specialists engage with local and smaller suppliers, after thorough pre-qualifi cation, to 
</p>
<p>support them in adopting CSR practices and upgrading their sustainability perfor-
</p>
<p>mance. At this stage, the company pursues a truly  responsible   purchasing strategy. 
</p>
<p> As companies move from Stage 1&ndash;6, purchasing as a business function becomes 
</p>
<p>more integrated and its focus shifts from traditional cost-driven transactional pur-
</p>
<p>chasing to value-driven, supplier development (a theme also emphasized in Lee and 
</p>
<p>Rammohan ( 2017 ), Chap.   20    ). 
</p>
<p> In the next section, we provide some examples of how companies handle respon-
</p>
<p>sible purchasing as well as a discussion on how the examples relate to the theoreti-
</p>
<p>cal concepts presented above.

<p>11.5.1     Mattel: How Bad Practices at the Suppliers May 
</p>
<p>Affect the Entire Supply Chain? 
</p>
<p>  Violation   of human rights or environmental unfriendly practices by suppliers do 
</p>
<p>harm to the entire supply chain. In 2007, Mattel, the global leader in children&rsquo;s toys, 
</p>
<p>became front-page news due to its problems with Chinese suppliers. A few suppliers 
</p>
<p>had replaced certifi ed paint with cheaper paints to reduce cost. Unfortunately, the 
</p>
<p>new paint contained lead, which is generally considered to be harmful to children&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>health and safety. By bringing these products to consumers, Mattel apparently was 
</p>
<p>violating US regulations on health and safety. Mattel was not informed by its con-
</p>
<p>tract manufacturers of the change of paint. The company received the news when a 
</p>
<p>European retailer discovered lead paint on a toy. Due to extensive press exposure, 
</p>
<p>Mattel&rsquo;s senior management had to recall 1.5 million Chinese-made products. Later, 
</p>
<p>another 436,000 products had to be recalled. Because of this incident, Mattel found 
</p>
<p>itself in the center of a debate over sustainable sourcing and more particularly about 
</p>
<p>the safety of products made in China.

</p>
<p> Apparently, during the many years that Mattel sourced its products from China, the 
</p>
<p>company had become overconfi dent about its ability to operate in China without 
</p>
<p>major problems. Initially, it seemed that the problem was limited to only one supplier. 
</p>
<p>However, when Mattel&rsquo;s safety lab at Shenzhen investigated the contents of their toys, 
</p>
<p>other products with similar failures surfaced. That was the moment that the manage-
</p>
<p>ment recognized it probably had to deal with a more systemic problem, rather than the 
</p>
<p>isolated case of one bad paint supplier. Earlier, Mattel was involved in another affair 
</p>
<p>when it had to recall millions of toys with tiny magnets that had harmed some children 
</p>
<p>who swallowed them. Mattel found out that some of its preferred suppliers, in order 
</p>
<p>to save costs, used cheaper suppliers themselves. One of these low-cost suppliers was 
</p>
<p>the paint supplier who was not listed on Mattel&rsquo;s approved supplier list. 
</p>
<p> Mattel has been manufacturing in Asia far longer than many other companies. The 
</p>
<p>fi rst Barbie was made there in 1959. Other products, like its Fisher Price toys, 
</p>
<p>Matchbox cars, and Pixar toys, followed. It developed long-term  relationships   with 
</p>
<p>certain Chinese contractors, some of which spanned decades. Paradoxically, this 
</p>
<p>might have worked against the company. The longer it outsourced to a factory sup-
</p>
<p>plier with good results, the more lax its controls became. Two contractors that caused 
</p>
<p>the recalls were among the most trusted. Lee Der, the supplier involved in the fi rst 
</p>
<p>recall, worked with Mattel for 15 years. Early Light Industrial, which made the Sarge 
</p>
<p>cars, supplied toys for more than 20 years. The latter supplier caused the recall of 
</p>
<p>436,000 Pixar car toys, which was also caused by yet another contractor, as Early 
</p>
<p>Light had subcontracted production of the cars&rsquo; roof and tires to a subcontractor 
</p>
<p>called Hong Li Da. In all cases, Mattel&rsquo;s contract manufacturers violated the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s rules on what paint they were allowed to use. Mattel had certifi ed only eight 
</p>
<p>paint suppliers. Mattel realized that it was not monitoring its contract manufacturers 
</p>
<p>closely enough. It appeared that a number of companies were part of Mattel&rsquo;s supply 
</p>
<p>chain that were never visited by Mattel&rsquo;s sourcing professionals and quality inspec-
</p>
<p>tors. As a result, Mattel&rsquo;s board of management decided on a three-point action plan 
</p>
<p>which included: (1) tightening control of  production, (2) investigating unauthorized 
</p>
<p>use of subcontractors by contract manufacturers, and (3) bringing back in-house test-
</p>
<p>ing of all purchased products. Based on its investigations, Mattel fi red four contrac-
</p>
<p>tors and they enforced the rule upon their contract manufacturers that they cannot 
</p>
<p>hire two or three layers of suppliers below them. In order to restore its reputation, 
</p>
<p>global advertising campaigns were set up to inform consumers about the measures 
</p>
<p>that were taken. Part of the campaign was  the   statement that Mattel is less dependent 
</p>
<p>on Chinese suppliers than most of its competitors.

<p> Suppliers are  an   important source for a company&rsquo;s competitive advantage. However, 
</p>
<p>as the examples of Boeing and Mattel have shown, suppliers can also be an impor-
</p>
<p>tant source of unforeseen problems and risk. How should companies deal with these 
</p>
<p>sustainability problems and risks in supply chain relationships? How and what

</p>
<p> principles should companies put in place with regard to people, planet, and profi t in 
</p>
<p>supplier relationships? How should companies convince suppliers to promote sus-
</p>
<p>tainability principles in their operational processes? Companies that know how to 
</p>
<p>deal with these issues are still rare. Some companies are leading the way. Philips is 
</p>
<p>one of them. 
</p>
<p> In 2002, Philips started a worldwide sustainability program for its global pro-
</p>
<p>curement organization. For this purpose, in 2003 a standard was developed with 
</p>
<p>regard to the requirements that suppliers should meet in the area of sustainability. 
</p>
<p>The standard was implemented in 2004. This is no small thing, if one realizes that 
</p>
<p>more than 50,000 suppliers worldwide were involved in the program. All suppliers 
</p>
<p>were invited to participate in the program through a formal letter sent by Philips&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>CEO. The letter encouraged suppliers to conduct a &ldquo;self-assessment&rdquo; and to report 
</p>
<p>the outcome of this self-assessment to Philips. Next, Philips would conduct a simi-
</p>
<p>lar audit by its own internal auditors. For this program, more than 400 associates 
</p>
<p>were trained and instructed. Next, the results of the Philips&rsquo; audit were compared 
</p>
<p>with the results from the supplier&rsquo;s self-assessments. Variances between both audits 
</p>
<p>were discussed and suppliers were invited to come up with an action plan to take 
</p>
<p>corrective measures, which were periodically followed up by Philips&rsquo; procurement 
</p>
<p>organization. In its audits, Philips focuses on sustainability and the way in which 
</p>
<p>suppliers deal with issues such as environmental protection, labor conditions, 
</p>
<p>safety, child labor, discrimination and diversity, the number of labor hours, and 
</p>
<p>compliance with local labor laws. Apart from this, the auditors focus on the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of banned substances. Attention is paid also to the suppliers&rsquo; relationships with 
</p>
<p>unions.  Just   asking suppliers to sign a declaration in which they declare to comply 
</p>
<p>with Philips&rsquo; environmental policies, like in the past, was not enough anymore. In the 
</p>
<p>past, suppliers were, with their eye on future business, very much willing to put their 
</p>
<p>signature without actually checking their operations against Philips CSR guidelines. 
</p>
<p>For Philips&rsquo; CEO, this was no longer suffi cient. The company wanted to ensure that 
</p>
<p>suppliers were meeting its CSR requirements. Suppliers that did not meet these 
</p>
<p>requirements were dropped from Philips&rsquo; suppliers list. As a result, the number of 
</p>
<p>suppliers worldwide was reduced from 50,000 to about 30,000, most of whom are 
</p>
<p>now in line with Philips&rsquo; environmental policies. Environmental regulations become 
</p>
<p>increasingly tighter, especially for European fi rms. The list of banned substances for 
</p>
<p>European fi rms is consistently growing. Next, European consumer laws require 
</p>
<p>fi rms to offer a full traceability of their products and product components. After 
</p>
<p>some incidents, where products that were imported from Asian manufacturing facil-
</p>
<p>ities contained hazardous materials, Philips started its BOMCheck program that 
</p>
<p>would require suppliers to keep record in a web-enabled Philips- controlled database 
</p>
<p>of their product constituents and origins. This database would secure Philips from 
</p>
<p>future claims from consumers and NGOs based on banned substances. 
</p>
<p> Is the approach suffi cient for the future? The answer, clearly, is &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Philips, at 
</p>
<p>this moment, has aligned its fi rst-tier suppliers with its environmental policies.

</p>
<p>Today, Philips urges its suppliers to transfer their CSR policies to their (second-tier) 
</p>
<p> suppliers   and raw materials producers. In this area, the company still has a long way 
</p>
<p>to go.  
</p>
<p>11.5.3     Unilever: How to Improve the Sustainability 
</p>
<p>of the Supply Chain? 
</p>
<p>  Another   company that gives priority to sustainability in the supply chain is Unilever. 
</p>
<p>In 2010, Unilever launched its Sustainable Living Plan. This plan was aimed at 
</p>
<p>achieving three major objectives before 2020: (1) to help more than 1 billion people 
</p>
<p>improve their health and well-being, (2) to halve the environmental footprint of 
</p>
<p>Unilever&rsquo;s products, and (3) to source 100 % of all agricultural raw materials sus-
</p>
<p>tainably and enhance the livelihoods of people across the entire value chain. The 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Living Plan was based upon a thorough analysis of Unilever&rsquo;s carbon 
</p>
<p>footprint across its value chain, from its raw materials suppliers up to its retailers 
</p>
<p>and end consumers. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig.  11.2 .
</p>
<p>   This fi gure shows that only 3 % of Unilever&rsquo;s carbon footprint is caused by its 
</p>
<p>factories. Around 2 % is caused by its distribution and transport network. However, 
</p>
<p>its supplier network is responsible for 26 %, which represents a signifi cant  challenge 
</p>
<p>for its sourcing specialists. In addition, the majority of its carbon footprint is caused 
</p>
<p>by the consumer at the point of consumption. This analysis explains why Unilever 
</p>
<p>has put great emphasis on new product development and innovation in order to 
</p>
<p>stimulate sustainable behavior from their consumers. 
</p>
<p> New detergents, allowing for less water consumption and lower temperatures, 
</p>
<p>have been introduced. Another example is body care products, such as shampoos 
</p>
<p>that allow faster rinsing when taking a shower. Sourcing strategies have been aimed 
</p>
<p>at improving farmer productivity, less use of pesticides, and increasing the use of 
</p>
<p>renewable energy. Unilever&rsquo;s Sustainable Living Plan has changed its international 
</p>
<p>sourcing strategies signifi cantly. Unilever is not unique in taking supply chain sus-
</p>
<p>tainability initiatives. Other frontrunners in the food business are Nestl&eacute;  and   Mars, 
</p>
<p>who embarked on similar programs.

</p>
<p>11.5.4     Nestl&eacute;: How to Adopt Responsible Purchasing?  8  
</p>
<p> Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s Nespresso division may serve as an example of the time-phased model 
</p>
<p>presented in Sect.  11.4 . Until 2003, Nespresso was a growing coffee roaster focused 
</p>
<p>on the premium consumer segment. It sourced its high-quality coffee through global 
</p>
<p>commodity traders such as ECOM and Expocafe. In 2003, it had to rethink its 
</p>
<p>sourcing model. The reason was threefold. 
</p>
<p> On the one hand,  its   sourcing strategy was felt to be too much supply-driven. 
</p>
<p>Until the beginning of the 1990s, the coffee market was a controlled market regu-
</p>
<p>lated internationally through the International Coffee Agreement ( ICA  )   . However, in 
</p>
<p>1999, the International Coffee Organization failed to set new export quotas and as a 
</p>
<p>result it collapsed. Oversupply in many coffee markets led to price erosion, which 
</p>
<p>had terrible social, economic, and political consequences. Nespresso, being a high-
</p>
<p>quality coffee brand, was confronted with fl awing and ever-changing coffee quality 
</p>
<p>grades. Moreover, the fl uctuating raw materials prices were a direct threat to a con-
</p>
<p>sistent consumer pricing policy and the company&rsquo;s profi tability. On the other hand, 
</p>
<p>global coffee consumption went through a period of signifi cant growth  creating a 
</p>
<p>high demand. The company constantly had to struggle to fi nd high-quality coffee at 
</p>
<p>the right volumes and the right prices. In addition, oversupply in the coffee markets 
</p>
<p>led to low and unfavorable prices that had a detrimental effect on farmer incomes. 
</p>
<p>Grassroots and NGOs, such as Greenpeace and the Fair Trade movement, joined 
</p>
<p>forces in promoting the welfare of small producers in  developing countries (Alvarez 
</p>
<p> 2008 ), accusing MNCs such as Nestl&eacute; of unethical and  unsustainable practices in 
</p>
<p>their supply chain relationships. Multinationals were, rightly or wrongly, accused of 
</p>
<p>violating local labor laws, ignoring issues of climate change, and performing unethi-
</p>
<p>cal practices in their supplier relationships. More specifi cally, NGOs took aim at the 
</p>
<p>unjustifi ed profi ts that were reported by these companies, accusing them of unfair 
</p>
<p>distribution of profi tability within the coffee supply chain. Nespresso had to increas-
</p>
<p>ingly deal with the pressure of these three forces. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Lopez, Chief Procurement Offi cer (CPO) of Nespresso, was asked to look 
</p>
<p>into this changing context, as it had direct consequences for his global sourcing 
</p>
<p>organization. The challenges he and his team had to deal with were as follows: How 
</p>
<p>could Nespresso secure its supply of high-quality coffee in such unstable market 
</p>
<p>conditions? How could Nespresso avoid bad publicity, when they operated at such 
</p>
<p>a large distance from the coffee growers? How could or should Nespresso improve 
</p>
<p>the conditions in the supply chain? Would it be possible to conceive of a sourcing 
</p>
<p>model that would incorporate all of these factors? And how should such a sourcing 
</p>
<p>model look like? 
</p>
<p> Mr. Lopez and his colleagues pondered about designing a new sourcing model for 
</p>
<p>Nespresso. Here, companies like Toyota and IKEA, who had long-term and strong 
</p>
<p>sourcing relationships with their suppliers, served as a source of inspiration. They 
</p>
<p>decided to change Nespresso&rsquo;s mediated sourcing model and go for a model allowing 
</p>
<p>8   The following text is derived from: Van Weele and Van Tubergen ( 2013 ), p. 18. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Nespresso to deal directly with the coffee growers. This would mean that gradually 
</p>
<p>most intermediate organizations that Nespresso had dealt with for such a long time 
</p>
<p>needed to be bypassed. The basic idea underlying this plan was that if Nespresso was 
</p>
<p>able to select its suppliers itself, it could build a strong personalized relationship with 
</p>
<p>them and transfer knowledge to improve farmer practices and secure the supply of 
</p>
<p>coffee. Nespresso would motivate its coffee growers by paying them a premium over 
</p>
<p>the market price. This direct sourcing model would allow Nespresso to have a much 
</p>
<p>larger control over its supply chain, which was felt  necessary to improve farmer 
</p>
<p>productivity and quality and increase supply chain transparency and sustainability. 
</p>
<p> In order to implement  the   direct sourcing model&mdash;changing the entire way of 
</p>
<p>working with suppliers&mdash;Nespresso needed to change its business model. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Lopez and his staff initiated a companywide program, i.e., Nespresso&rsquo;s AAA 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Quality Program in 2003. The aim of this program was to foster both 
</p>
<p>quality and sustainability in all supply chain relationships. Several tools, such as an 
</p>
<p>innovative farm assessment and support program, were developed to select and 
</p>
<p>involve coffee suppliers in the program (Goodbrand.com). Core elements of the 
</p>
<p>program were:
</p>
<p>    1.     Certifi cates :  Nespresso   developed a proprietary standard to assess social and 
</p>
<p>environmental standards on coffee farms. This was done in close collaboration 
</p>
<p>with Rainforest Alliance.   
</p>
<p>   2.     Premiums :  Nespresso   paid 30&ndash;40 % above the standard coffee market price; this 
</p>
<p>would amount to about 10&ndash;15 % above the coffees of the same quality.   
</p>
<p>   3.     Partnering :  Nespresso   aimed at developing long-term relationships with coffee 
</p>
<p>farmers to improve farmer productivity and decrease crop diseases.    
</p>
<p>  The growth path in adopting sustainability and responsible practices in its supply 
</p>
<p>chain relationships took Nespresso almost 10 years. However, today its global pro-
</p>
<p>gram for coffee supply is unique, representing a fi rm basis for Nespresso&rsquo;s market 
</p>
<p>success. It has built some strong supplier relationships, although these have to be 
</p>
<p>continuously adapted to challenges in the world, such as climate change, poverty, or 
</p>
<p>changing regulating environments.  
</p>
<p>11.5.5     Shared Value Creation in the Examples 
</p>
<p> As the examples  of   Mattel, Philips, Unilever, and Nestl&eacute; show, the relationship with 
</p>
<p>suppliers is an important topic to foster supply chain value creation. In order to 
</p>
<p>unleash the innovative capacity and create shared value in the supply chain, exten-
</p>
<p>sive (green) collaboration is needed between supply chain partners. This list of 
</p>
<p>examples could have been much longer. Other companies operating in retail and 
</p>
<p>fast-moving consumer goods have made CSR a cornerstone in their sourcing poli-
</p>
<p>cies and supply chain relationships. 9  Value creation is not only aimed at creating 
</p>
<p>9   See for other examples Walmart ( http://goo.gl/U8wzHT ) and IKEA ( http://goo.gl/fl XzdM ).

</p>
<p>shareholder value; rather, as companies interact with their environment, it is aimed 
</p>
<p>at meeting demands and requirements of other important stakeholders such as cus-
</p>
<p>tomers, society, NGOs, and suppliers. Creating shared value seems to be the key. 
</p>
<p> Nespresso&rsquo;s example also shows that driving sustainability in supply chain rela-
</p>
<p>tionships results in an unexpected source of productivity and human well-being, if 
</p>
<p>and only if sustainability is well-integrated in the business model. However, it is 
</p>
<p>important that the sustainable business model remains adaptable to the ever- 
</p>
<p>changing context in which buyers and suppliers operate. Meanwhile, the example, 
</p>
<p>set by Nespresso, has now been followed by many food producers  including 
</p>
<p>  Unilever, Danone, Mars, Pepsico, Royal FrieslandCampina, and Nutreco.   
</p>
<p>11.6      Challenges in Creating Sustainable Supplier 
</p>
<p>Relationships 
</p>
<p> The examples in this chapter have subscribed the view that driving sustainability 
</p>
<p>through the supply chain is a source of innovation and cost reduction. A growing 
</p>
<p>number of scholars and practitioners state that including sustainability has become 
</p>
<p>a prerequisite for a business model to be competitive these days. Responsible 
</p>
<p>Purchasing ( RP  ) is one of the key elements of a sustainable business model, although 
</p>
<p>it is not always easy to integrate it in an (existing) business model. It requires 
</p>
<p>(long term) commitment not only from the buying company, but also from its (busi-
</p>
<p>ness critical) suppliers. Previous research has shown that four important issues 
</p>
<p>hamper the implementation of RP, i.e., a complex context, the lack of internal com-
</p>
<p>mitment, the diffi culty in obtaining supplier involvement, and the evaluation of 
</p>
<p>sustainable practices. It is important for purchasing to take these challenges into 
</p>
<p>account from the very fi rst phase of an RP implementation strategy. Here, we dis-
</p>
<p>cuss each of these issues in more detail. 
</p>
<p>   Complex context   : Since companies are increasingly sourcing on a global scale, 
</p>
<p>they are operating in differing national and international institutional contexts; 
</p>
<p>thereby they are coping with a lot of (heterogeneous) suppliers. Major differences 
</p>
<p>exist among suppliers (e.g., fi rm size and business model orientation) and in the 
</p>
<p>(institutional) environments of suppliers (e.g., in public policy, national labor law, 
</p>
<p>environmental standards, and poverty levels). The sustainability practices of a sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain can be compliant with the law in one country, yet they may not meet the 
</p>
<p>minimum standard of another country&rsquo;s law. In addition, there is an abundance of 
</p>
<p>local and global sustainability standards and benchmarks for supply chains that are 
</p>
<p>not always compatible. Section  11.3  has listed some well-known general standards. 
</p>
<p>However, this list is far from complete, as also many sector-specifi c sustainable 
</p>
<p>supply chain standards exist. This abundance makes it easy for companies to get 
</p>
<p>lost in the details of the standards. Thus, which standards and certifi cates should 
</p>
<p>organizations choose and comply with? In addition, which standards will  survive   in 
</p>
<p>the future? 
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>275
</p>
<p>   Internal commitment : Another   challenge is the internal commitment to RP 
</p>
<p>within the buying company. As the shift towards sustainable supply chain manage-
</p>
<p>ment, particularly RP, requires a sustained business model, top management com-
</p>
<p>mitment is an issue, especially when the urgency for sustainability has not reached 
</p>
<p>the boardroom yet. Several studies have shown the importance of top management 
</p>
<p>commitment for responsible purchasing and supply practices in the organization 
</p>
<p>(Walker and Brammer  2013 ). The purchasing function should be able to present 
</p>
<p>the strategic value of RP, clearly showing the social, environmental, and fi nancial 
</p>
<p>benefi ts of RP. In addition, they have to create commitment from other depart-
</p>
<p>ments within the organization as well, such as the marketing and R&amp;D function. 
</p>
<p>This requires collaboration and integration among multiple levels of the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion and the supply chain. It also requires a frontrunner mentality within those who 
</p>
<p>lead the purchasing function. 
</p>
<p>  Supplier involvement : In order to  benefi t   from sustainability initiatives in the 
</p>
<p>supply chain, all business critical supply partners should comply with the sustain-
</p>
<p>ability policy. However, how do suppliers benefi t from complying with the sustain-
</p>
<p>ability policy? How should organizations deal with suppliers that do not want or are 
</p>
<p>not able to comply with the sustainability standards and the combined risks for 
</p>
<p>excluding certain qualifying suppliers, for example, smallholders? What are the 
</p>
<p>effects of imposing rules and guidelines on supplier operations and innovativeness? 
</p>
<p>How should organizations deal with the suppliers of the suppliers, what are the 
</p>
<p>boundaries of the corporate responsibility of the buying company? These issues 
</p>
<p>could be addressed by integrating (key) suppliers in the design and development of 
</p>
<p>the sustainability standards within the supply chain by means of stakeholder 
</p>
<p> meetings and co-creation sessions. In this way, a certain platform among the supply 
</p>
<p>chain partners is created, increasing the chances that suppliers transfer  these   sus-
</p>
<p>tainability practices to their own supply chain partners as well. 
</p>
<p>  Monitoring and evaluation :  Companies   are using several techniques to measure 
</p>
<p>and report the level of progress in sustainability practices of their suppliers. 
</p>
<p>However, monitoring is one thing, acting upon it is another. Based on extensive 
</p>
<p>multinational company research, it turns out that companies measure many 
</p>
<p> (intermediate) results, but they do not always show them against actual targets set 
</p>
<p>in the supply chain (Van Weele and Vivanco  2014 ). In addition, it is unclear what 
</p>
<p>initiatives, i.e., actions, deliver the best results in terms of corporate advantage and 
</p>
<p>shared value in the supply chain. Sustainability practices should be evaluated just 
</p>
<p>like any other business practice instead of within a separate CSR department with 
</p>
<p>separate KPIs and performance measures. Organizations should try to map the busi-
</p>
<p>ness impact from particular sustainability initiatives and make a selection on the 
</p>
<p>profi table initiatives (profi table in the broadest sense of the word, i.e., people, 
</p>
<p>planet, profi t (PPP)). However, many researchers state that the current tools are not 
</p>
<p>able to measure the impact in all three PPP dimensions accurately. Especially, direct 
</p>
<p>and indirect social impact, both on the value chain members and on their communi-
</p>
<p>ties, is diffi cult to measure. This requires further development of current M&amp;E sus-
</p>
<p>tainability performance tools.

</p>
<p>11.7      Conclusions and Suggestions 
</p>
<p> What should companies do to foster RP and build responsible supply chain relation-
</p>
<p>ships? Here, we present some suggestions:
</p>
<p>&bull;    Conduct a full Value Chain Analysis, revealing your company&rsquo;s carbon footprint 
</p>
<p>(see also Chap.   3     by Boukherroub et al. ( 2017 )) and CSR risk exposure. Every 
</p>
<p>CSR policy starts with a thorough fact-fi nding. Every value chain is different. 
</p>
<p>When the company conducts such an analysis, it will realize that signifi cant part 
</p>
<p>of its total carbon footprint is related to actual product used by customers and its 
</p>
<p>suppliers. In addition, the value chain analysis should also focus on other ele-
</p>
<p>ments regarding responsibility such as compliance to social laws and human 
</p>
<p>labor conditions. Hence, new product development for less energy intensive 
</p>
<p>products is needed. This should be followed by a sustainable sourcing policy 
</p>
<p>aimed at reducing the carbon footprint in the upstream supply chain; preferably 
</p>
<p>with suppliers that have a sound and well-implemented CSR policy. Procurement 
</p>
<p>and supply chain management without doubt will appear to be the key drivers of 
</p>
<p>initiatives to drive down the supply chain carbon footprint, water usage, and 
</p>
<p>waste and improve social conditions at supplier worksites.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Formulate ambitious goals and objectives to drive down upstream supply chain 
</p>
<p>carbon footprint and other CSR impacts. Ambitious goals like reducing both 
</p>
<p>water consumption and energy consumption with 50 % in 5 years time in the 
</p>
<p>upstream supply chain are necessary to create a sense of urgency and drive inno-
</p>
<p>vative solutions. More importantly, these goals and objectives need to be fol-
</p>
<p>lowed up both by the supply chain management and the board.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Partner with suppliers. The formulated goals and objectives cannot be achieved 
</p>
<p>by the company in isolation. They need to seek support from their supply base. 
</p>
<p>Auditing suppliers on implementation of sustainability practices (see Box  11.2  
</p>
<p>of this chapter) is the fi rst step. Inviting suppliers to come up with ideas and solu-
</p>
<p>tions to meet the predetermined sustainability goals and objectives is the second 
</p>
<p>step. When selecting suppliers for future business, having a sustainability policy 
</p>
<p>in place is recommended as a qualifying criterion.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Supplier development. As meeting these predetermined sustainability goals and 
</p>
<p>objectives is to be seen as the joint responsibility between the buyer and his sup-
</p>
<p>pliers, buyers need to be intimately familiar with the best practices within the 
</p>
<p>suppliers&rsquo; industries. Rather than deal-making, the buyer will spend his time 
</p>
<p>setting up supplier development programs. Part of his/her job will be discussing 
</p>
<p>and suggesting ideas for productivity improvement and shop fl oor effi ciency. 
</p>
<p>This would call for a new generation of buyers, who need to be technically quali-
</p>
<p>fi ed, commercially skilled, and sensitive to dealing with different cultures.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Value- and revenue-driven, rather than cost-driven. When adopting these prac-
</p>
<p>tices, purchasing will change in nature from a traditional cost-driven activity, to 
</p>
<p>a value- and revenue-driven activity that is much better aligned with business 
</p>

<p>KPIs will make up the purchasing managers&rsquo; performance dashboards. This will 
</p>
<p>enable them to share best practices within and across sectors and to effectively

<p>team up with (non)governmental institutions.    
</p>
<p> It must be noted, however, that companies will take different pace through differ-
</p>
<p>ent levels of maturity on their path to supply chain sustainability. The path will be 
</p>
<p>different depending on whether companies operate upstream or downstream of their 
</p>
<p>value chain. Companies operating downstream in the value chain in general are more 
</p>
<p>visible to the public and the press and will therefore be pressed to adopt sustainability 
</p>
<p>practices in general, and more particularly, in their supply chain relationships. This 
</p>
<p>will be less true for companies operating more upstream in their value chains. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, business experiences show that adopting CSR practices in many cases 
</p>
<p>is sound business, leads to more controlled supply chain relationships and better col-
</p>
<p>laboration, and therefore often results in a better long-term profi tability. It should 
</p>
<p>therefore be a prime concern to all purchasing and supply chain managers.

<p> Green Technology Choice

<p>     Anton     Ovchinnikov    
</p>
<p>12.1          Introduction 
</p>
<p> In late 2000s, Wells Fargo, a large US bank, asked themselves a profoundly important, 
</p>
<p>yet very simple, question: &ldquo;If our clients fi nd it profi table to borrow money from us 
</p>
<p>to install solar panels on their roofs, shouldn&rsquo;t we fi nd it profi table too?&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> The reason this question is important is because Wells Fargo has over 6000 
</p>
<p>branches (called &ldquo;stores&rdquo; within the bank), which are primarily concentrated along 
</p>
<p>the US &ldquo;sunbelt.&rdquo; Covering even a small portion of these branches roofs with solar 
</p>
<p>panels would make the bank a large renewable energy producer. The reason this 
</p>
<p>question is simple is because the answer seems to be obvious. And yet, as this chap-
</p>
<p>ter describes, the decision to install the photovoltaic, PV, system (solar panels)&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;green technology&rdquo; in this case&mdash;was far from straightforward, with many caveats 
</p>
<p>and sub-questions, which open a variety of opportunities for research in sustainable 
</p>
<p>operations. 
</p>
<p> The author was fortunate to advise a bank executive who was responsible for this 
</p>
<p>project; see the two-case series by Ovchinnikov and Hvaleva ( 2012 ). The chapter 
</p>
<p>therefore starts by using this example to highlight some of the key questions faced 
</p>
<p>when working on this decision; other examples will be drawn upon as well, as the 
</p>
<p>chapter progresses. The chapter is structured around eight key questions related to 
</p>
<p>green technology choices:
</p>
<p>    1.    What exactly does the &ldquo;green technology choice&rdquo; imply?   
</p>
<p>   2.    What are the different components of costs and revenues (cost savings) that fac-
</p>
<p>tor into a green technology choice decision?

</p>
<p>   3.    What are the impacts of (government) incentives on green technology choice 
</p>
<p>decisions?   
</p>
<p>   4.    How does performance uncertainty impact the decision to invest in renewable 
</p>
<p>energy technologies?   
</p>
<p>   5.    What is the impact of pricing models on &ldquo;green&rdquo; technology choice?   
</p>
<p>   6.    Do consumers reward fi rms that chose &ldquo;green&rdquo; technologies?   
</p>
<p>   7.    How to motivate and ensure adoption of &ldquo;green&rdquo; technologies across supply 
</p>
<p>chains?   
</p>
<p>   8.    How governmental regulations may lead to the leakage of unsustainable prac-
</p>
<p>tices to areas with low enforcement?    
</p>
<p>  In this chapter, we will review the existing operations management literature on 
</p>
<p>each of these questions, describe the main fi ndings, and comment on the open ques-
</p>
<p>tions. We start by providing a high-level taxonomy of what exactly the &ldquo;green tech-
</p>
<p>nology choice&rdquo; implies?  
</p>
<p>12.2     A Taxonomy of Green Technology Choices 
</p>
<p>Along a Firm&rsquo;s Supply Chain 
</p>
<p> Quite generally, sustainable  operations   consider some &ldquo;base-line&rdquo; production sys-
</p>
<p>tem that converts various inputs (materials, energy, labor, time) into outputs. As a 
</p>
<p>byproduct, this system also generates pollutants. A by-far most typical assumption 
</p>
<p>in the economics literature as well as in operations is that pollution is linear in out-
</p>
<p>put. In other words,  x  units of output generate some  x  &times;  w  units of pollutants. 
</p>
<p> A green technology  i  could then be viewed as a set of activities and processes 
</p>
<p>that remove  r  i % of pollutants, so that the resultant emissions become  x  &times;  w  &times; (1 &minus;  r  i ). 
</p>
<p> As became common in the literature and practice, this chapter will differentiate 
</p>
<p>these activities by the place in a supply chain where they are undertaken. Scope 1 
</p>
<p>activities (technologies, emissions, etc.) correspond to those made within the imme-
</p>
<p>diate boundary of a focal fi rm. Scope 2 activities correspond to the union of the fi rm 
</p>
<p>and its energy sources. Scope 3 includes the upstream supply chain partners of the 
</p>
<p>fi rm, as well as downstream emissions; we only focus primarily on the upstream 
</p>
<p>part here. See the schematic presented in Fig.  12.1  (and see Chap.   3     by Boukherroub 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2017 ) for more detail):
</p>
<p>   The majority of research in sustainable operations considered energy-related 
</p>
<p>technologies, and therefore, correspond to Scope 2; the Wells Fargo example is 
</p>
<p>in the same category as well. The number of studies that considered Scope 1 and 
</p>
<p>3 activities is approximately the same. The chapter will therefore include sub-
</p>
<p>stantial discussion of energy-related research, but will also consider the deci-
</p>
<p>sions within the focal fi rm and its suppliers. Naturally, those decisions are 
</p>
<p>largely identical as which fi rm along the supply chain is &ldquo;focal&rdquo; depends on the 
</p>
<p>viewpoint. 
</p>
<p>A. Ovchinnikov</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-29791-0_3">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-29791-0_3</a></div>

<p>281
</p>
<p> In that regard, within Scope 1,    there are three somewhat different approaches to 
</p>
<p>framing the technology choice problem. First, as is done in Krass et al. ( 2013 ), one 
</p>
<p>can consider a problem of changing one technology (&ldquo;dirty&rdquo;) with another (&ldquo;clean&rdquo;), 
</p>
<p>so that after the change all production occurs with the new/clean technology. In the 
</p>
<p>case-study &ldquo;c-Energy&rsquo;s Red Hill plant: Meeting the SO 2  challenge,&rdquo; Ovchinnikov 
</p>
<p>( 2008 ) illustrates this framing on the example of deciding to install a scrubber at a 
</p>
<p>power plant. In this case, the management of an old power plant faces a decision to 
</p>
<p>operate &ldquo;as-is,&rdquo; which will require purchasing emissions allowances or invest in 
</p>
<p>either a wet scrubber (with medium effi ciency, low fi xed cost, but high variable 
</p>
<p>cost) or a dry scrubber (with high effi ciency, high fi xed and low variable costs). The 
</p>
<p>case provides data to evaluate the economics and risks of each option and the ques-
</p>
<p>tion is that of the choice: the plant management needs to decide which option to 
</p>
<p>adopt. The numbers work out such that the wet scrubber has marginally lower cost, 
</p>
<p>but the dry scrubber removes much more pollutants; hence most decision makers 
</p>
<p>lean toward suggesting that the company should adopt a somewhat costlier but envi-
</p>
<p>ronmentally much better dry scrubber. 
</p>
<p> A second approach is to consider &ldquo;how much&rdquo; of clean technology to invest in. 
</p>
<p>Implicitly, this is the problem Wells Fargo faced (although they always considered 
</p>
<p>the maximum size permitted on a roof). Hu, Souza, Ferguson and Wang (2014), and 
</p>
<p>Kok et al. ( 2014 ) consider this question explicitly: the amount of renewable capac-
</p>
<p>ity is a decision variable in their papers. 
</p>
<p> Finally, a third approach is to suppose that a fi rm already has two types of tech-
</p>
<p>nologies at its disposal, for example, plants with and without scrubbers, and is 
</p>
<p>deciding on the allocation of production between the different kinds of plants, which 
</p>
<p>have different economic and operational characteristics. This approach has been 
</p>
<p>implemented both in  the   economics literature, e.g., see Carraro and A. Soubeyran 
</p>
<p>( 1996 ), and in operations, e.g., Drake, Kleindorfer, and Van Wassenhove (2010). 
</p>
<p> Before proceeding with the insights of these papers, we need to discuss the profi t 
</p>
<p>functions.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>282
</p>
<p>12.3     Cost Components of Green Technology Choice 
</p>
<p> As the &ldquo; economics 101&rdquo;   wisdom states: profi t = revenues&mdash;costs. In regards to the 
</p>
<p>green technology choice decisions, the revenue component is sometimes disre-
</p>
<p>garded. This can be done with little loss of generality whenever the fi rm is a price 
</p>
<p>taker, or consumers are not responding to the &ldquo;greenness&rdquo; of the fi rm&rsquo;s technology 
</p>
<p>(see more on this in Sect. 7). 
</p>
<p> In the Wells Fargo case, although there clearly was a public relations benefi t 
</p>
<p>from solar panels, which might have translated into revenue, it was decided to focus 
</p>
<p>solely on cost savings. Hence, the problem became one of cost minimization. In 
</p>
<p>some other cases, for example, in the settings of Krass et al. ( 2013 ) or Raz and 
</p>
<p>Ovchinnikov ( 2015 ), the fi rms are price setters, hence they consider the revenue 
</p>
<p>given by the number of units sold &times; price. An important modeling difference 
</p>
<p>between these two papers (and how they account for revenues) is whether the sup-
</p>
<p>ply equals demand. 
</p>
<p> In deterministic demand scenarios, as in Krass et al., demand = sales = quantity 
</p>
<p>produced in equilibrium. This implies that there is a one-to-one relationship 
</p>
<p>between the price, p, and the production quantity,  q  &equiv;  D ( p ), for some demand func-
</p>
<p>tion,  D,  and hence one only needs to consider a single decision that characterizes 
</p>
<p>revenue. Then Revenue =  p  &times;  D ( p ). In stochastic demand scenarios, demand &lt; &gt; 
</p>
<p>sales &lt; &gt; quantity produced. This implies that one needs to separately  consider 
</p>
<p>  price and production quantity,  q , decisions. Then Revenue =  p  &times; min [ q ,  D ( p )]. An 
</p>
<p>intermediate case is when the price of the product is selected after the uncertain 
</p>
<p>demand is realized. This results in an outcome that supply = demand whenever 
</p>
<p>profi table. 
</p>
<p> A fi nal consideration for the revenue component is it&rsquo;s stability over time. 
</p>
<p>Intermittency that is inherent, for example, in the renewable energy technologies 
</p>
<p>will be considered separately (see Section 5). But even without intermittency, the 
</p>
<p>performance of some kinds of green technologies tends to degrade over time. As 
</p>
<p>reported in Ovchinnikov and Hvaleva (2013), PV systems&rsquo; energy output degrades 
</p>
<p>at a rate of 0.5 % per year. Since many technologies could have long lifetimes (25 
</p>
<p>years for a PV system), this gradual degradation could play an important role. 
</p>
<p> On the costs side, one generally considers fi xed and variable costs. Fixed costs 
</p>
<p>correspond to the cost of procurement and installation of the equipment, retrofi tting 
</p>
<p>the machinery, etc. In the Wells Fargo example, the fi xed cost is straightforward: it&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>a one-time outlay of cash to install the system. The caveat with solar is that the cost 
</p>
<p>of solar panels is steadily declining, hence the installation decision has the time 
</p>
<p>dimension: this is the topic of my (B) case on Wells Fargo. In the c-Energy example, 
</p>
<p>the fi xed costs also corresponded to installation of the equipment. 
</p>
<p> For the variable costs, in most cases there is a cost to operate the &ldquo;green&rdquo; equip-
</p>
<p>ment. In the c-Energy&rsquo;s case with the dry scrubber, there was a small energy that 
</p>
<p>was diverted from the boiler to run the scrubber, and with the wet scrubber, there 
</p>
<p>also was a cost of the reagent and  its   transportation. Even in the Wells Fargo exam-
</p>
<p>ple, where it is generally believed that renewable energy technologies have a zero 
</p>
<p>A. Ovchinnikov</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>283
</p>
<p>variable cost, in reality there was a cost for insuring the additional property and to 
</p>
<p>replace the AC/DC inverters every 10 years. 
</p>
<p> Two more points are worth mentioning in the elements of the profi t function. 
</p>
<p>First is the time dimension. The demand and variable cost numbers are often per 
</p>
<p>year, while fi xed costs are one-time. Hence, either a proper net present value analy-
</p>
<p>sis must be considered, or annualized costs must be used. Second, the &ldquo;do-nothing&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>option, i.e., the option of not investing in green technology, should be carefully 
</p>
<p>analyzed. Specifi cally, while one might assume that that option involves zero cost, 
</p>
<p>in many cases that is not so: in the c-Energy example, for instance, doing nothing 
</p>
<p>involved purchasing emission allowances, which had an net present value (NPV) of 
</p>
<p>negative USD60 million. As straightforward as these two points are, I saw many 
</p>
<p>students who were making mistakes with these issues. 
</p>
<p> Hu et al. ( 2015 ) present a comprehensive analysis that combines the revenues 
</p>
<p>and costs of investing in a renewable (&ldquo;green&rdquo;) energy source, as well as accounts 
</p>
<p>for their variability and correlation over time. Their main fi nding is about the granu-
</p>
<p>larity of the analysis. Indeed, if the lifespan of a PV system is 25 years (their paper 
</p>
<p>uses my Wells Fargo case as an example), what time intervals are needed to analyze 
</p>
<p>the problem? The initial analysis of Ovchinnikov and Hvaleva assumed a yearly 
</p>
<p>time increments and average system effi ciency of 18 % (meaning that on average 
</p>
<p>over a year the system produces 18 % of its nominal generation capacity, this

<p>includes the number of hours of sunlight, location of the sun over the horizon, etc.). 
</p>
<p>With this effi ciency and the size of Wells Fargo roof that allowed for a 15 kW sys-
</p>
<p>tem, it will not provide enough power for the branch, hence additional power would 
</p>
<p>have to be purchased from the grid. Hu and coauthors obtained detailed generation 
</p>
<p>and demand data from Wells Fargo and showed that nearly 9 % of the time the PV 
</p>
<p>system generated more power than  was   consumed by the branch. Figure  12.2  pres-
</p>
<p>ents a typical summer week&rsquo;s generation (dashed line) and consumption (solid line) 
</p>
<p>and such cases are clearly visible.
</p>
<p>   These 9 % are very important, because the excess power is sold through net 
</p>
<p>metering, at a rate that is nearly 3 times higher than the cost of buying the power

</p>
<p>from the grid. The yearly granularity masks this effect and, as Hu and coauthors 
</p>
<p>show, results in a major impact on the cost assessment and the optimal size of 
</p>
<p>installed system. Based on their data Figure  12.3  suggests that 15-min or 1-h incre-
</p>
<p>ments are virtually indistinguishable,    but even a 24 h increment already results in 
</p>
<p>nearly 15 % error in assessing the profi tability of the system and in over 200 % error 
</p>
<p>in the optimal system size. In other words, granularity really matters: the renewable 
</p>
<p>energy project could be more profi table than the simplifi ed analysis suggest, and 
</p>
<p>smaller installations may be required: both of these fi ndings are critical in promot-
</p>
<p>ing green technology choice.
</p>
<p>   An additional, technical contribution of Hu et al.&rsquo;s paper is in demonstrating how 
</p>
<p>to implement granular analysis in practice. Indeed, a 25-year cash fl ow statement 
</p>
<p>implemented, for example, in Excel with 15 min granularity will have 
</p>
<p>25 &times; 365 &times; 24 &times; 4 = 876,000 columns&mdash;an undoable task for most managers and their 
</p>
<p>computers. The authors present a simpler approach stemming from the observation 
</p>
<p>that since all that matters is the NPV of the system, many entries in this massive 
</p>
<p>calculation could have identical NPVs and hence can be collapsed into a single 
</p>
<p>number (e.g., with a discount rate of 10 %, a payment of 1000 in year 0 and a pay-
</p>
<p>ment of 1100 in year 1 will both have NPV of 1000). This greatly simplifi es 
</p>
<p>calculations. 
</p>
<p> Kleindorfer et al. ( 2012 ) present another detailed examination of the costs and 
</p>
<p>benefi ts of investing in a green technology, now based on the example of fl eet 
</p>
<p>renewal at La Poste (French postal service). La Poste currently operates a fl eet of 
</p>
<p>over 40,000 diesel (internal combustion engine ICE) delivery vehicles and is evalu-
</p>
<p>ating an option of replacing some of them with electric vehicles (EV). ICEs have 
</p>
<p>low(er) fi xed costs, but high operating costs, which is also uncertain due to fuel 
</p>
<p>price fl uctuations. EVs have a high(er) fi xed costs, but lower variable costs: no fuel 
</p>
<p>and 30 % less maintenance.  EVs   also result in a much lower carbon emissions 
</p>
<p>because nearly 80 % of electricity in France is generated with Nuclear power 
</p>
<p>plants. Referring to the above discussion about the importance of fi xed costs, the 
</p>

</p>
<p>authors explicitly account for them and further consider that the EV fi xed costs are 
</p>
<p>expected to decline. This creates a strategic delay in adopting the green technology; 
</p>
<p>the next Section will discuss this in further detail. Overall, for each technology they 
</p>
<p> consider the total cost of ownership&mdash;the NPV analysis conceptually identical to 
</p>
<p>the Wells Fargo approach. The authors report a pilot test resulting from their model 
</p>
<p>and the plan to signifi cantly expand the EV fl eet as a result of that pilot test and 
</p>
<p>their work. 
</p>
<p> The fi nal element of  the   profi t function: one that was crucial in the Wells Fargo 
</p>
<p>case: government incentives. The reason governments around the world provide 
</p>
<p>incentives for the adoption of green technologies is because of the effect of external-
</p>
<p>ity&mdash;a situation where the production and consumption of the good impose indirect 
</p>
<p>involuntary benefi ts or costs on other economic agents who are outside the market 
</p>
<p>place for that good. Generating electricity with a PV system installed on the roof of 
</p>
<p>a building affects the building&rsquo;s owner who pay less for electricity as well as other 
</p>
<p>people, who have nothing to do with the building, by reducing emissions as com-
</p>
<p>pared to the fossil fuel sources. Similarly, driving an EV versus an ICE vehicle low-
</p>
<p>ers emissions which benefi t the drivers of EVs, the drivers of ICUs, and even those 
</p>
<p>who do not drive at all. Incentives are therefore provided so that the owner of the 
</p>
<p>building would properly factor (the economics term, &ldquo;internalize&rdquo;) this indirect, 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;external,&rdquo; benefi t to others. See the Introduction to Raz and Ovchinnikov ( 2015 ) 
</p>
<p>for a more detailed discussion of this issue. 
</p>
<p> Overall, while one might think that accounting for the benefi ts and costs of 
</p>
<p>investing in green technology is rather straightforward, the above studies show that 
</p>
<p>there are numerous detail that must be carefully incorporated. These studies  provide 
</p>
<p>excellent examples and a solid starting point for the researchers and practitioners. 
</p>
<p> With this progress, however, I would identify two open research possibilities. 
</p>
<p>First is the impact of the ownership  structures   on the technology choice. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, Wells Fargo&rsquo;s initial approach only considered the 12-year time horizon (as 
</p>
<p>opposed to the PV system 25-year useful life) because an average lease of their 
</p>
<p>building is 12 years. Since a PV system is not easily detachable from the property 
</p>
<p>on which it is installed, the lack of clear agreements between the property owners 
</p>
<p>(who benefi t from the residual value of the technology) and the tenants (who benefi t 
</p>
<p>from operational savings but incur the initial cost) could be a deterring factor in 
</p>
<p>adoption. A similar deterrent plays a role with many other green technologies that 
</p>
<p>have long lifetimes and relatively long payback periods. A manufacturing fi rm will 
</p>
<p>not invest in energy-effi cient technology if it expects to relocate its production to a 
</p>
<p>lower-cost country in future. Another example of the ownership structure chal-
</p>
<p>lenges is present in a global shipping industry, where the ship owner selects the 
</p>
<p>energy-effi cient technology and bears the capital costs of installing it, but the cur-
</p>
<p>rent contractual agreements are such that the charterer of the ship is incurring the 
</p>
<p>fuel costs which are passed on to the shippers. Hence, despite the existence of mul-
</p>
<p>tiple green technologies, e.g., see   www.theicct.org/reducing-ghg-emissions-ships    , 
</p>
<p>with positive NPVs their adoption is lagging. Aligning the incentives of the  property

</p>
<p>owners and users is therefore an interesting avenue for the  green technology choice   
</p>
<p>research and practice. 
</p>
<p> The second opportunity is in expanding the scope of  the   operational impact of 
</p>
<p>the green technology. In the La Poste example, for instance, the authors note that, 
</p>
<p>with ICEs, the delivery routes and drivers&rsquo; behavior were optimized so as to mini-
</p>
<p>mize fuel consumption. But with EVs, this objective is no longer valid, and rather 
</p>
<p>the objective should be to maximize the average daily kilometers driven per vehicle 
</p>
<p>(so as to leave fewer kilometers to be driven in a fuel-consuming ICEs). The deliv-
</p>
<p>ery routes re-optimization presents a downstream operational change following the 
</p>
<p>adoption of green technologies. Expanding on this opportunity&mdash;what are the other 
</p>
<p>operational decisions (routing, lot sizing, scheduling, etc.) that are affected by the 
</p>
<p>change in the fi xed versus variable costs structure following the adoption? And 
</p>
<p>consequently, how should these changes be incorporated upstream to the profi tabil-
</p>
<p>ity (total cost) analysis of green technologies? These questions also offer interesting 
</p>
<p>research opportunities.  
</p>
<p>12.4     Impact of Government Incentives in Green Technology 
</p>
<p>Choice Decisions? 
</p>
<p> Government incentives generally come in three different forms. First are the incen-
</p>
<p>tives provided to consumers who buy the fi rm&rsquo;s product, for example, the USD7500 
</p>
<p>tax credit provided to buyers of electric vehicles (EV) in the US; I prefer to call 
</p>
<p>them &ldquo;rebates&rdquo;; see Krass et al. ( 2013 ), Raz et al. ( 2014 ), and their case study of 
</p>
<p>Chevy Volt, a popular EV in North America. In some other papers, these are referred 
</p>
<p>to as subsidies with the implications that  those   are &ldquo;consumer subsidies,&rdquo; e.g., see 
</p>
<p>Lobel and Perakis ( 2011 ) and Cohen, Lobel, and Perakis ( 2014 ). 
</p>
<p> A form of rebate considered in Alizamir et al. ( 2014 ) and implicitly in Hu et al. 
</p>
<p>(2014) is a feed-in-tariff (FIT). FIT is linked to the concept of net metering and 
</p>
<p>refers to a price that is paid by  the   electric utility to the owner of the renewable 
</p>
<p>energy system should the supply of power generated by the system exceed what had 
</p>
<p>been used by the building. It is as is the energy meter will roll backwards, and the 
</p>
<p>consumer will receive the money for selling power rather than pay for using it. 
</p>
<p> The second form are the incentives provided to fi rms who use the green tech-
</p>
<p>nologies to manufacture their products. These forms of incentives are common in 
</p>
<p>the healthcare industry and somewhat less common in sustainability arena. I prefer 
</p>
<p>to call such incentives &ldquo;variable cost subsidies.&rdquo; A negative subsidy can be viewed 
</p>
<p>as a tax; note that a rescaling may be required if tax is levied on units of emissions 
</p>
<p>rather than production. 
</p>
<p> The third form are the incentives provided for the fact of adopting the green 
</p>
<p>technology. As an example, consider the 38 % profi t tax credit that Wells Fargo 
</p>
<p>obtained on its investment right in the year when the cost was incurred. I prefer to 
</p>
<p>call them &ldquo;fi xed cost subsidies.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>A. Ovchinnikov</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>287
</p>
<p> These different  forms o  f incentives are summarized in Table  12.1 . With these 
</p>
<p>rebate and subsidy incentive tools, researchers considered different mechanisms for 
</p>
<p>incentivizing the adoption of green technologies.
</p>
<p>   Raz and Ovchinnikov ( 2015 ) considered a price-setting newsvendor fi rm that 
</p>
<p>decides on  price and production quantity   of a &ldquo;green product&rdquo; in response to the 
</p>
<p>policy set by the government regulator. The regulator, in turn, anticipates this 
</p>
<p>response and set the policy so as to maximize societal welfare, accounting for the 
</p>
<p>fi rm&rsquo;s profi t, consumer surplus, externality, and the government cost. Their key 
</p>
<p>analytical fi nding is that, with a combination of rebate and subsidy, it is possible to 
</p>
<p>achieve the socially optimal (fi rst-best) welfare, but the optimal subsidy is often 
</p>
<p>negative, i.e., is actually a tax. That is, to incentivize the fi rm, produce the right 
</p>
<p>amount of the green product and price it correctly; the government provides very 
</p>
<p>large rebates  to   consumers, which generates a windfall of profi t to the fi rm that is 
</p>
<p>then taxed to recover the cost of providing rebates. The intuition for why this 
</p>
<p>approach is optimal is in its impact on the service level: high rebate implies high 
</p>
<p>selling margin, which in turn implies a higher critical fractile. Consumers there-
</p>
<p>fore face less stock-out risk while the government saves because rebates only 
</p>
<p>apply to units sold (as opposed to subsidy that applies to units made, including 
</p>
<p>those not sold). 
</p>
<p> Raz et al. ( 2014 ) further consider an extended example of Chevy Volt (discussed 
</p>
<p>in even further detail in their case study) and show that the current rebate-only 
</p>
<p>incentive of $7500, although structurally suboptimal, has a very small welfare loss. 
</p>
<p>Overall, their work provides a direct support for the use of tax as an incentive mech-
</p>
<p>anism, but does not explicitly deal with the technology choice problem. 
</p>
<p> Krass et al. ( 2013 ) consider the impact of tax specifi cally in the technology 
</p>
<p>choice problem. In their paper, the fi rm is considering whether to invest in one of k 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;green&rdquo; technologies, where, as discussed above, technologies differ in fi xed and 
</p>
<p>variable costs as well as in their environmental effi ciency. The regulator taxes the 
</p>
<p>fi rm for pollution, and investing in an effi cient technology is a way to reduce tax 
</p>
<p>obligations. Their main result is that  the   environmental tax has a non-monotone 
</p>
<p>impact on the green technology adoption: while as expected, small taxes motivate 
</p>
<p>the fi rm adopt a green technology, large taxes do not. This is driven by the fi xed cost 
</p>
<p>effect: subject to a large tax the fi rm has to raise prices, which reduces the sales

</p>
<p>quantity, and so the total additional revenue with green technology may not be 
</p>
<p> suffi cient to offset its higher installation cost. 
</p>
<p> They further consider the regulator&rsquo;s problem, and specifi cally, the effi ciency of 
</p>
<p>using tax and the need to support it  with   fi xed cost subsidies and rebates. They fi nd 
</p>
<p>that tax is effi cient for medium level of externality parameter (referred to as &ldquo;envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental concerns&rdquo; in their paper), but for both small and large externality pollut-
</p>
<p>ants a combined approach with taxes, rebates, and fi xed costs subsidies is needed. 
</p>
<p>The only case when the combined approach cannot reach the fi rst-best welfare is 
</p>
<p>when the externality is very small and the socially optimal technology choice is 
</p>
<p>actually &ldquo;dirty,&rdquo; while the fi rm selects &ldquo;clean.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> In the abovementioned papers,  the   regulation is modeled through the goal of 
</p>
<p>maximizing the social welfare. A different approach with the goal of achieving an 
</p>
<p>exogenously given adoption target is studied in Lobel and Perakis ( 2011 ), Cohen, 
</p>
<p>Lobel, and Perakis ( 2014 ), and in Chemama et al. ( 2014 ), Cohen, Lobel, and Perakis 
</p>
<p>( 2014 ). These papers consider what I call rebates, although refer to them as &ldquo;subsi-
</p>
<p>dies.&rdquo; Alizamir et al. ( 2014 ) consider both an exogenously given target and a wel-
</p>
<p>fare maximization problem and use the feed-in-tariff, which is a form of rebate as 
</p>
<p>well, as discussed above. 
</p>
<p> Lobel and Perakis study a problem of designing the dynamic path for the value 
</p>
<p>of rebate for PV systems in order to achieve (in expectation) the target number of 
</p>
<p>installation by the end of the incentive period. This framing of the problem is moti-
</p>
<p>vated by the government programs in Europe, see Jager-Waldau ( 2012 ). A con-
</p>
<p>sumer&rsquo;s decision to install a system is modeled with a random utility logit model. 
</p>
<p>They fi t their model to the date from Germany and show that rather than being 
</p>
<p>constant, the rebate should initially be high, but then gradually decrease as more 
</p>
<p>people adopted the green technology and those who have not yet adopted it are due 
</p>
<p>to self-selection less sensitive to rebates. 
</p>
<p> This fi nding echoes what happened in the (B) part of my Wells Fargo case, where 
</p>
<p>the utility company in Los Angeles (LADWP) decided to abandon the fl at rebate and 
</p>
<p>introduced a tiered structure, where the more solar capacity has been installed, the 
</p>
<p>smaller the rebate would be. Exhibit 1 in the case refl ects the status as of 2013, and 
</p>
<p>the current rebate levels can be found on the LADWP Solar Incentive Program web-
</p>
<p>site. For Wells Fargo and others who were deciding whether to install solar system 
</p>
<p>or not, this meant that the decision gained the strategic timing dimension: should 
</p>
<p>they install now, when the rebates are high but the chance of getting them is uncer-
</p>
<p>tain, or wait, then the chances will be higher, but the rebates will be lower, yet the 
</p>
<p>cost will be lower to. In Wells Fargo&rsquo;s case, it was more profi table to wait for a year, 
</p>
<p>which is what they actually did. The question of such a strategic behavior impacting 
</p>
<p>green technology adoption is a subject of Chemama et al. ( 2014 ). They show that  the 
</p>
<p>  fl at rebate policy is often less expensive on average, but the fl exible rebate policy 
</p>
<p>results in a lower variance of the rebate program cost for the government. 
</p>
<p> Alizamir et al. ( 2014 ) explicitly study the question of whether there exists a 
</p>
<p>rebate (feed-in-tariff) schedule that would result in no strategic delay. They show 
</p>
<p>that for some parameter ranges this is indeed the case, and most such cases involve 
</p>
<p>a variable rebate. When the parameters, however, fall outside of this automatic &ldquo;no 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>289
</p>
<p>delay&rdquo; region, then should the government decide to design a rebate policy that 
</p>
<p>would result in no delays, then such a policy would have a constant rebate. 
</p>
<p> Finally, Cohen et al. ( 2014 ) study the impact  of   demand uncertainty on the green 
</p>
<p>technology adoption in more detail. Specifi cally, they show that ignoring the uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty in demand (and optimizing rebates as if demand was deterministic) could lead 
</p>
<p>to signifi cantly missing the adoption target. Additionally, they investigate whether 
</p>
<p>consumer surplus could increase as a result of demand uncertainty&mdash;an observation 
</p>
<p>also made by Raz and Ovchinnikov. They show that the situation is somewhat 
</p>
<p>nuanced as there exists a tradeoff between lower prices and possibility to underserve 
</p>
<p>consumers with high valuations (who will receive the highest surplus loss if the 
</p>
<p>product is stocked out). 
</p>
<p> A third approach to modeling the impact of  regulation   on the technology choice 
</p>
<p>decision is through capacity allocation among a portfolio of technologies, e.g., see 
</p>
<p>Drake et al. ( 2014 ). Wang et al. (2014) and Hu et al. (2014) also implicitly consider 
</p>
<p>portfolios of two technologies, but not from the perspective of incentives and 
</p>
<p>regulation. 
</p>
<p> Drake et al. compare  the   impacts of tax (fi xed emissions cost) versus cap-and- 
</p>
<p>trade (variable emissions cost) and show that emissions price uncertainty under 
</p>
<p>cap-and-trade results in greater expected profi t than a constant emissions price 
</p>
<p>under an emissions tax, which contradicts common logic. They attribute that to two 
</p>
<p>operational drivers: the fi rm's option not to operate, which effectively right-censors 
</p>
<p>the uncertain emissions price; and dispatch fl exibility, which effectively allows the 
</p>
<p>fi rm to arbitrage on the variability of the emissions cost under the cap-and-trade. 
</p>
<p>They also explore policy implications: they show that variable cost subsidies have 
</p>
<p>little impact on the total capacity, but fi xed cost subsidies increase capacity. This 
</p>
<p>happens because the fi rm benefi ts from a variable cost subsidy only when the cor-
</p>
<p>responding capacity is utilized (as opposed to the fi xed cost subsidy that acts even 
</p>
<p>when the capacity is temporarily not utilized, e.g., if the carbon price is too low). 
</p>
<p> Islegen and Reichelstein ( 2011 ) consider the impact of the cost of emissions on 
</p>
<p>the adoption of a specifi c green technology&mdash;carbon capture and storage (CCS) at 
</p>
<p>fossil-fuel power plants. Krass et al. ( 2013 ) also use CCS in cement industry as one 
</p>
<p>of their motivating examples. A distinctive feature of Islegen and Reichelstein&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>work is that they present a result calibrated on the empirical data (as opposed to 
</p>
<p>stylized models considered by other authors). They account for numerous real-life 
</p>
<p>complications and operational details, and by doing so provide practically relevant 
</p>
<p>estimates. They fi nd that in a typical US scenario, the cost of carbon must be 
</p>
<p>approximately USD$31 for CCS to be a break-even choice for a newly built coal 
</p>
<p>power plant and USD$60 for a natural gas-powered power plant. Their calculations 
</p>
<p>provide insights into how big the effective carbon tax (emissions price if a cap-and- 
</p>
<p>trade is used) should be for CCS to become viable in a practical (operational) power 
</p>
<p>generation setting. 
</p>
<p> Overall, there has been a signifi cant amount of work done to understand how 
</p>
<p>operational characteristics of green technology choice impact the design of 
</p>
<p> government incentive for their adoption, and a short conclusion is that those char-
</p>
<p>acteristics matter a lot.

</p>
<p> A curious observation is that all abovementioned papers consider monopolistic 
</p>
<p>fi rms. Hence, an immediate and very important research opportunity is to under-
</p>
<p>stand the impact of competition between fi rms onto the effi ciency of incentives, and 
</p>
<p>the reverse impact of incentives on the competition. To the best of my knowledge, 
</p>
<p>the teams of Cohen&amp;Perakis and Krass&amp;Ovchinnikov are currently working on 
</p>
<p>such  competitive analysis  , but there likely is more to be done than their papers will 
</p>
<p>accomplish. A related observation is that from sustainability perspective competi-
</p>
<p>tion happens both in the output markets (e.g., between GM and Nissan, who both 
</p>
<p>sell EVs) and in the inputs markets (e.g., between GM and Samsung, who both buy 
</p>
<p>rare-earth metals for their batteries). Perhaps, incentivizing the adoption of green 
</p>
<p>technologies could be even more effi cient if instead of promoting outputs (EVs) the 
</p>
<p>government programs will target inputs, relying on the market forces to do the rest.  
</p>
<p>12.5     Impact of Performance Uncertainty on &ldquo;Green&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Technology Investment Decisions 
</p>
<p> An inherent feature of many green technologies is that their performance varies due 
</p>
<p>to a variety of external factors. For example, in regards to renewable energy, wind 
</p>
<p>does not always blow (and when it does the speed varies), sun does not always shine 
</p>
<p>(and when it shines there can be more or less of it depending on the clouds), etc. 
</p>
<p>Even well-established technologies could have varying performance; in the exam-
</p>
<p>ple of cEnergy, the effi ciency of &ldquo;wet&rdquo; SO 2  scrubbing at power plants depends sig-
</p>
<p>nifi cantly on the coal being burned. Some of these variations are predictable and can 
</p>
<p>be planned for (e.g., sun does not shine at night), but in many cases the performance 
</p>
<p>of the green technology is truly uncertain in a sense of  a   random event. This uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty is referred to as &ldquo;intermittency.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> Because operations management traditionally enriched economic models with 
</p>
<p>the ways to counter uncertainty, it is natural that several authors considered the 
</p>
<p>impact of intermittency and related challenges and opportunities on the green tech-
</p>
<p>nology choice. For obvious reasons, much of this research is focused on renewable 
</p>
<p>energy technologies, and I will therefore focus on this application as well. 
</p>
<p> Intermittency has a dramatically different impact on operations depending on 
</p>
<p>whether the party performing the analysis is a buyer of energy or a seller. 
</p>
<p> For a buyer of power (such as Wells Fargo), the problem effectively is about cor-
</p>
<p>rectly taking the expectation over the nonlinearity introduced by the cases when 
</p>
<p>supply is less than demand and power must be purchased from the grid, and the 
</p>
<p>opposite cases when power is sold back to the grid. As discussed earlier, because of 
</p>
<p>net-metering the feed-in-tariffs for the latter are usually signifi cantly higher than the 
</p>
<p>costs of the former, hence this nonlinearity matters. See the paper by Hu et al. (2014) 
</p>
<p>for the treatment of this problem. Technically, the intermittency in their paper is 
</p>
<p>modeled as a discrete random variable with 20 mass points on a [0,1] support. 
</p>
<p> For the seller of power (such as the utility from which Wells Fargo purchases 
</p>
<p>energy when its PV system does not generate enough for what is demanded), the 
</p>
<p>problem is considerably more diffi cult. This is because of two factors. Consider a 
</p>
<p>A. Ovchinnikov</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>291
</p>
<p>power utility that operates a portfolio of technologies: intermittent renewable capac-
</p>
<p>ity, infl exible base-load generation (e.g., coal, nuclear, or hydro power plants), and 
</p>
<p>fl exible reactive capacity (such as natural gas turbines). The current dispatch rules 
</p>
<p>favor utilizing the capacity with the lowest marginal cost fi rst, and only after their 
</p>
<p>supply is exceeded, then dispatching the second-highest costs, etc. This suggests 
</p>
<p>that renewal capacity, which has zero marginal cost, is dispatched fi rst; this require-
</p>
<p>ment is also imposed politically in some countries, e.g., in Germany. 
</p>
<p> The challenge comes from overlaying this dispatch priority with an extremely 
</p>
<p>high service level guarantee that is either implicit, or in many cases, also legisla-
</p>
<p>tively mandated, in many jurisdictions: 99.9 % or more. Basically, the supply of 
</p>
<p>power must be available whenever a user turns on a switch (or an automated system, 
</p>
<p>such as air conditioning units power up). This means that whenever the intermittent 
</p>
<p>supply drops, e.g., because the wind slows or a cloud covers the sun, some other 
</p>
<p>source of power must become immediately available. This in turn implies that 
</p>
<p>along-side the investments in renewable but intermittent capacity, the sellers of 
</p>
<p>power must also invest in non-renewable, power-on-demand capacity to offset for 
</p>
<p>possible intermissions. 
</p>
<p> The paper by Afl aki and Netessine ( 2011 ) considers strategic investments in 
</p>
<p>renewable energy in the light of intermittency and service guarantee. In their model, 
</p>
<p>   intermittency is represented as a two-point distribution (i.e., the energy from the 
</p>
<p>renewable source is either available with full capacity, or completely unavailable) 
</p>
<p>and the service guarantee is assumed at 100 % (that is, an equal amount of renew-
</p>
<p>able and non-renewable capacity must be installed to offset intermittence). Their 
</p>
<p>main question is about the impact of carbon pricing (tax, specifi cally, see previous 
</p>
<p>Section) on the intermittent renewable energy investments. 
</p>
<p> Their main result is that the impact consists of two counter-acting forces. The 
</p>
<p>fi rst force is the decreased carbon tax obligations from a cleaner renewable technol-
</p>
<p>ogy, and this positively affects installed renewable capacity. But the second force is 
</p>
<p>that the more clean renewable capacity is installed, the more &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; backup capac-
</p>
<p>ity is needed. Hence, if the tax is low, or the clean technology is rarely not produc-
</p>
<p>ing, the former effect dominates which motivates higher capacity investments, but if 
</p>
<p>the tax is high or the technology is often down, the latter effect dominates. This 
</p>
<p>fi nding is qualitatively similar to the non-monotone response to the environmental 
</p>
<p>tax in Krass et al. ( 2013 ), but is driven by the increased tax burden of intermittency 
</p>
<p>as opposed to the tradeoff between shrinking demand and fi xed costs. 
</p>
<p> Intermittency is also modeled as a two-point distribution in Kok et al. ( 2014 ), but 
</p>
<p>the main focus of their paper is different, and I will discuss it further in this chapter. 
</p>
<p>Such a simplifi ed approach, however, downplays the importance of curtailing&mdash;a 
</p>
<p>practice that gains popularity in the industry. Curtailing refers to purposefully 
</p>
<p>reducing the output of the intermittent power source; in practice, this can be done, 
</p>
<p>for example, by tilting the blades of a wind turbine to capture more or less wind. 
</p>
<p> Wu and Kapuschinski ( 2013 ) highlight a fundamental importance of curtailing. 
</p>
<p>Contrary to a na&iuml;ve belief, they show that  the   operating cost reduction from curtail-
</p>
<p>ing can be signifi cant and may exceed the marginal production cost of conventional 
</p>
<p>sources. They further show that minimizing the system operating cost with the cur-
</p>
<p>tailment option often reduces emissions. Thus, curtailment can be both  economically 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>292
</p>
<p>and environmentally benefi cial. This happens because curtailing allows operating 
</p>
<p>the conventional infl exible sources in a more operationally effi cient mode. 
</p>
<p> Another natural solution to  the   intermittent supply from clean energy sources is 
</p>
<p>storage, and consequently industry players considered the problem of adding stor-
</p>
<p>age to the renewable energy generation facilities. General Electric (GE), for exam-
</p>
<p>ple, developed a suite of hardware and software solutions for integrated management 
</p>
<p>of wind turbines, batteries, and  consumer   applications, see the Fig. 12.4  for how 
</p>
<p>such systems work.

</p>
<p>   Zhou et al. ( 2014a ) consider the problem of operating a wind power generating 
</p>
<p>facility with storage. They also  consider   transmission constraint, which, in fact, is 
</p>
<p>an additional reason for why such technical curtailing is practiced (in contrast with 
</p>
<p>economic curtailing analyzed by Wu and Kapuschinski  2013 ). Zhou et al. fi nd that 
</p>
<p>adding storage can substantially increase the value of wind power generation, typi-
</p>
<p>cally by 30 % or more. 
</p>
<p> They also point to another source of value from a storage capacity. Since the 
</p>
<p>base-load supply of power (from nuclear, coal, or hydro plants) is very infl exible, 
</p>
<p>when such supply exceeds demand, electricity markets occasionally observe nega-
</p>
<p>tive prices;    this happens up to 5 % of the time (see Fig.  12.5 ).
</p>
<p>   In this context, energy storage also  provides   arbitrage opportunities: buy power 
</p>
<p>when the price is negative and store it until the price becomes positive again. 
</p>
<p>Combining curtailing (i.e., the ability to not produce power when the price is nega-
</p>
<p>tive) with storage provides an additional 5 % profi t gain from the system. In isola-
</p>
<p>tion, however, storage operations reduce the benefi t from economic curtailment, but 
</p>
<p>increase the overall cost savings (this is also shown by Wu and Kapuschinski  2013 ). 
</p>
<p> Zhou et al. ( 2014b ) further analyze storage operation in the presence of (occa-
</p>
<p>sionally) negative prices in light of yet another technological possibility: disposal of 
</p>
<p>power. The disposal systems, also known as load banks (see Fig.  12.6 ),  operate   at

<p>to consume power without heating much.
</p>
<p>   Zhou et al. ( 2014b ) fi nd that in the presence of negative prices,  the   optimal stor-
</p>
<p>age policy could be signifi cantly different than when prices are always nonnegative; 
</p>
<p>for example, they show that it can be optimal to empty an almost empty storage 
</p>
<p>facility and fi ll up an almost full one. They also show that the value of disposal is 
</p>
<p>positive, but lower than the value of storage. Their analysis, however, does not 
</p>
<p>directly account for the fi xed cost of installing disposal or storage capacity. 
</p>
<p> Summarizing the research in this category, I would like to make two observa-
</p>
<p>tions. First, nearly all aforementioned papers are solidly grounded in industry prac-
</p>
<p>tice and data. The presented analytical models are calibrated with the real operation 
</p>
<p>in mind and the conclusions are drawn in &ldquo;hard dollars.&rdquo; This is certainly positive. 
</p>
<p>Second, however, these papers focus nearly exclusively on a narrow operational 
</p>
<p>problem of  energy producer,  without taking the broader demand response into 
</p>
<p>account. Arguably, the existence of negative prices in the grid is an artifact of the 
</p>
<p>current (suboptimal and simplifi ed) demand management practices. This naturally 
</p>
<p>motivates the next Section of this chapter and the respective research opportunity.  
</p>
<p>12.6     Demand Management and Green Technology Choice 
</p>
<p> Many view  operations   management as a science, art, and practice of matching sup-
</p>
<p>ply with demand. From this perspective, the classical &ldquo;supply chain management&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>assumes that demand is given and rigid and devises methods for adjusting supply to 
</p>
<p>meet demand. To the contrary, &ldquo;revenue management&rdquo; assumes that capacity is 
</p>
<p>infl exible and therefore considers methods for adjusting demand, most commonly 
</p>
<p>through pricing. A decision to adopt a green technology offers opportunities for 
</p>
<p>both supply-side and demand-side management. 
</p>
<p> On the supply side, the opportunities and challenges are evident, as discussed in 
</p>
<p>the preceding section, and perhaps for that reason they attracted more attention from 
</p>
<p>researchers. 
</p>
<p> On the demand side, there are fewer studies, but pricing was nevertheless incor-
</p>
<p>porated in two different ways: static/single price change and dynamic price changes. 
</p>
<p> Since adoption of a green technology changes the balance between fi rms&rsquo; fi xed 
</p>
<p>and variable costs, it is natural that the resultant optimal prices change. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, in Krass et al. ( 2013 ) adopting a green technology reduces environmental tax 
</p>
<p>payments, which reduces marginal cost, which in turn increases margin, and 
</p>
<p> consequently lowers the equilibrium price. An increase in tax increases the cost, 
</p>
<p>reduces the margin, and raises the price; an increase in rebate lowers the effective 
</p>
<p>price, etc. In contrast, the fi xed cost subsidy does not impact price under a given 
</p>
<p>technology choice, but impacts which technology is chosen. Similar dependencies 
</p>
<p>between the government incentives for green technology adoption and the price 
</p>
<p>charged by the fi rm are modeled in other studies on regulation, such as Cohen et al. 
</p>
<p>( 2014 ) or Raz and Ovchinnikov ( 2015 ). In these studies, price is a decision variable 
</p>
<p>A. Ovchinnikov</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>295
</p>
<p>in the fi rm&rsquo;s optimization problem. Those are static price changes, which are rea-
</p>
<p>sonable for the cases of deterministic demand (as in Krass et al study) or newsven-
</p>
<p>dor-like situations (as in Cohen et al.  2014 , or Raz and Ovchinnikov  2015 ). 
</p>
<p> In the cases with  cyclical   supply and demand variability, however, a single price 
</p>
<p>approach is suboptimal. Indeed, if there is more demand for electricity for air- 
</p>
<p>conditioning during the day, then shouldn&rsquo;t the electricity price be higher? Similarly, 
</p>
<p>since the sun is not shining at night, the electric utility must use non-renewable 
</p>
<p>power generation, with a positive variable cost, and that should push the prices up 
</p>
<p>as well. Consumers, in turn, could factor such price fl uctuations into account and 
</p>
<p>reallocate their consumption patterns so as to maximize their utility. 
</p>
<p> Kok et al. ( 2014 ) consider the impact of such cyclical dynamic pricing on 
</p>
<p>investments in renewable power generation and the resultant carbon emissions. 
</p>
<p>Specifi cally, they consider two pricing policies: static pricing (that they call 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;fl at&rdquo;) and two-period dynamic pricing (e.g., one price during the day, another 
</p>
<p>price during the night, that they call &ldquo;peak&rdquo; pricing). Under the dynamic policy, 
</p>
<p>they do not explicitly consider the utility-maximizing consumer behavior, and 
</p>
<p>instead, use an exogenously given demand function to describe how consumers 
</p>
<p>relocate some of the high-price demand to low-price time periods as a function of 
</p>
<p>the two prices. 
</p>
<p> They then consider how these two pricing models impact the amount of renew-
</p>
<p>able capacity installed by a household (&ldquo;distributed generator&rdquo;), independent renew-
</p>
<p>able energy producer (that only has renewable capacity), and vertically integrated 
</p>
<p>power utility (that has both renewable and non-renewable sources). Their main 
</p>
<p>result is that the same pricing policy leads to distinctively different outcomes for 
</p>
<p>different investors and technologies. 
</p>
<p> For solar technologies, peak pricing leads to more investment by households, but 
</p>
<p>less by commercial investors. This is because solar energy production is positively 
</p>
<p>correlated with demand, hence peak pricing consumers have more to gain by substi-
</p>
<p>tuting the expensive (high-demand, peak) power with free solar without changing 
</p>
<p>their consumption habits. But for the commercial investors, the ability of house-
</p>
<p>holds to shift consumption habits in response to peak pricing implies that the benefi t 
</p>
<p>of substituting costly fossil fuel generation with free solar is less than under the fl at 
</p>
<p>pricing (when no demand shifts occur). For wind technologies, this logic does not 
</p>
<p>always hold, because the correlation is mostly negative: that is, there are more/
</p>
<p>stronger winds at night when the demand for power is actually lower. Because of 
</p>
<p>this effect, fl at pricing could also lead to substantially lower emissions. 
</p>
<p> I believe that there are numerous research opportunities in connecting demand 
</p>
<p>management with green technologies. The emergence of smart grid and the &ldquo;inter-
</p>
<p>net of things&rdquo; would allow for managing various consumer devices and  consequently 
</p>
<p>make the use of scarce resources more effi cient. Predicting the use patterns and 
</p>
<p>consumer response and designing innovative business models and policies to moti-
</p>
<p>vate desired behaviors&mdash;all are interesting research opportunities. 
</p>
<p> An implicit assumption in  all   the papers surveyed in this section is that consum-
</p>
<p>ers are not willing to pay more as a result of green technology choices made by the 
</p>
<p>fi rms. I discuss this issue in more detail next.

</p>
<p>12.7     Green Technology Choices and Consumers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>Willingness-to-Pay 
</p>
<p> When addressing the  connection   between the green technology choice and con-
</p>
<p>sumer willingness-to-pay ( WTP  ), it is very important to differentiate between two 
</p>
<p>seemingly similar questions. First, do consumer wish to pay more for greener prod-
</p>
<p>ucts? Despite considerable research, the answer to this question is not unambigu-
</p>
<p>ous. Laroche et al. ( 2001 ) mention that throughout 1990s, both the percentage of 
</p>
<p>American consumers who are willing to pay more for  green products   increased to 
</p>
<p>67 % and how much more they are willing to pay increased to nearly 20 %. They 
</p>
<p>further mention that in UK a survey of female consumers&rsquo; perceptions of environ-
</p>
<p>mental claims on the packaging of clothes detergents found that 79 % agreed to pay 
</p>
<p>up to 40 % more for a product, which was identical in every respect to their own 
</p>
<p>brand and which had been proven to be green. The spread of eco-labeling allowed 
</p>
<p>to test these predictions on sales data, and the report by Carbon Trust ( 2012 ) states 
</p>
<p>that 67 % of UK  consumers   were more likely to buy a product with low carbon 
</p>
<p>footprint and 44 % would switch to a lower carbon product even if it is not their 
</p>
<p>fi rst-choice brand. Motivated by these  promising   results, marketers went on to iden-
</p>
<p>tify which consumers were willing to pay more for environmentally friendly prod-
</p>
<p>ucts. Roberts ( 1996 ) and Straughan and Roberts ( 1999 ) are classical studies in this 
</p>
<p>domain with hundreds of citations. 
</p>
<p> The questions regarding the effi ciency of eco-labels also raised signifi cant 
</p>
<p>research interest. For example, with respect to wood and paper products and the 
</p>
<p>Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC  )   , several authors examined whether consumers 
</p>
<p>are aware of FSC and are willing to pay more for FSC-certifi ed products. Elliott and 
</p>
<p>Vincent ( 2014 ) show that only 3 % of consumers are aware of  FSC   and nearly half 
</p>
<p>never heard about it. Regarding willingness-to-pay, they list multiple studies which 
</p>
<p>suggest that while consumers state that they might pay more, observing actual 
</p>
<p>behaviors (e.g., Anderson and Hansen  2004  monitored actual purchases of plywood 
</p>
<p>at Home Depot) reveals that consumers are not willing to pay more for certifi ed 
</p>
<p>plywood. 
</p>
<p> But the above questions are somewhat misleading for the purpose of this Section. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, when Wells Fargo installed solar panels on its roofs, Coca Cola (Wang et al. 
</p>
<p> 2013 ) or La Poste (Kleindorfer et al.  2012 ) started using electric delivery trucks, or 
</p>
<p>energy producer added renewable power to its portfolio, the respective products&mdash;
</p>
<p>banking services, drinks, mail and air-conditioning&mdash;did not change. Thus, the sec-
</p>
<p>ond question is whether consumers wish to pay more for the same product that are 
</p>
<p>manufactured/delivered/etc. in a &ldquo;greener&rdquo; way? 
</p>
<p> The direct answer to this question is elusive.    Intuitively, however, the answer 
</p>
<p>would seem to be &ldquo;No&rdquo;: for example, would you be willing to pay more for a taxi 
</p>
<p>ride in a hybrid car versus a regular car? Or are you even aware what kind of vehicle 
</p>
<p>delivers your mail? 
</p>
<p> But the indirect connection between the consumer willingness to pay and the 
</p>
<p>fi rms&rsquo; corporate social responsibility ( CSR  )    actions, including technologies they 
</p>
<p>A. Ovchinnikov</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>297
</p>
<p>choose, has been studied extensively. Sen and Bhattacharya ( 2001 ) found that  CSR   
</p>
<p>initiatives have positive effects on consumers&rsquo; perceptions of the &ldquo;Self-Company&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>congruence, i.e., affect consumers&rsquo; evaluations via their bond with the fi rms, which 
</p>
<p>depend on consumers&rsquo; own attributes. Specifi cally, this evaluation is more sensitive 
</p>
<p>to negative CSR information than to positive one. Similarly, Brown and Dacin 
</p>
<p>( 1997 ) found that CSR affects consumers via overall evaluation of the fi rm, and this 
</p>
<p>knowledge of the fi rm in turn affects their evaluation of the product. These two 
</p>
<p>papers are just a small sample of the vast body of literature on CRS and consumer 
</p>
<p>perceptions. 
</p>
<p> The general conclusion therefore is: while there is no direct evidence that con-
</p>
<p>sumers are willing to pay more as a result of green technology choices, indirectly, 
</p>
<p>though, there exists a halo effect: such choices impact consumers&rsquo; perceptions of 
</p>
<p>fi rms and consequently their products. This suggests an interesting research ques-
</p>
<p>tion: can fi rm operations be used to make the otherwise invisible green technology 
</p>
<p>choice more salient in the minds of consumers, and thus enhance the indirect link 
</p>
<p>identifi ed above? 
</p>
<p> The frequent invisibility of &ldquo;green&rdquo; (or not) behavior is an issue not only on the 
</p>
<p>consumer side, but also with supply chain partners.  This   motivates the next two sec-
</p>
<p>tions of the chapter.  
</p>
<p>12.8     Motivating and Ensuring Sustainable Behavior 
</p>
<p>Across Supply Chains 
</p>
<p> For many large fi rms in  the   developed economies, the &ldquo;technology choice&rdquo; ques-
</p>
<p>tion is rather indirect. Apple, Disney, Nike, and the likes are outsourcing most of 
</p>
<p>their production, typically to suppliers in Asia. Hence, it is the technology choice 
</p>
<p>of the suppliers that truly matters. Unfortunately, the legal systems and environ-
</p>
<p>mental standards in suppliers&rsquo; jurisdictions are often rather loose and fragile, so 
</p>
<p>that socially and environmentally responsible behaviors cannot be guaranteed 
</p>
<p>locally. At the same time, as described in the previous Section, should those irre-
</p>
<p>sponsible behaviors be discovered by the developed-world consumers, the respec-
</p>
<p>tive fi rms would suffer through a loss in consumer perception of the fi rms and their 
</p>
<p>products. 
</p>
<p> Therefore, a growing body of literature examines non-contractual relationships 
</p>
<p>between the buyers (in the developed world) and suppliers (in the developing world) 
</p>
<p>that could lead to better social and environmental practices/&ldquo;technologies.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> Guo et al. ( 2015 ) consider a sourcing decision of a buyer who has two kinds of 
</p>
<p>suppliers: responsible (who charge high price but adhere to strict standards) and 
</p>
<p>risky (who charge lower prices but may have a violation: leak, spill, etc.) The 
</p>
<p>authors consider all-risky, all-responsible, or mixed strategies and show how the 
</p>
<p>optimality of a given strategy is connected to consumers&rsquo; socially conscious behav-
</p>
<p>ior. They show that efforts to improve supply chain responsibility via consumers 
</p>
<p>(e.g., by increasing the number of consumers who are socially conscious or their 
</p>
<p>12 Green Technology Choice</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>298
</p>
<p>willingness-to-pay for responsibility) may lead to unintended consequences&mdash;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;backfi re,&rdquo; e.g., increase risky sourcing.  In   contrast, efforts that focus on enforce-
</p>
<p>ment and penalizing the buyer never backfi re and always lead to more responsible 
</p>
<p>sourcing. Chen and Lee ( 2014 ) apply mechanism design approach to help buyers 
</p>
<p>select responsible suppliers, and Izhutov and Lee ( 2014 ) consider the supplier&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>problem of investing in order to qualify as responsible. 
</p>
<p> None of these papers, however, directly address the incentives problem: how 
</p>
<p>can buyers motivate suppliers to become more responsible? This question is the 
</p>
<p>topic of Plambeck and Taylor ( 2014 ). They note that the most common approach to 
</p>
<p>monitor supplier are inspections. Such inspections are costly, and hence can only 
</p>
<p>be performed occasionally. Should one have a regularly scheduled inspections or 
</p>
<p>rather perform them at random? Intuitively, random inspections should be more 
</p>
<p>effi cient. But the authors point out that, in practice, inspections are also imperfect: 
</p>
<p>there are many ways to deceive inspectors: falsify records of maintenance and 
</p>
<p>training, show only exemplar parts of factories, train workers to lie, bribe inspec-
</p>
<p>tors, etc. In this situation, they derive a &ldquo;backfi ring&rdquo; condition, under which ran-
</p>
<p>dom inspections motivate less effort than scheduled, and so do more frequent 
</p>
<p>inspections. They further show that squeezing the margins is also more effi cient 
</p>
<p>than increasing them as a common logic might suggest. Kim ( 2015 ) also presents 
</p>
<p>a conceptually similar result, but in a context of a regulator that is monitoring a 
</p>
<p>potential violator (polluter). In both cases, even though the focus is on inspections 
</p>
<p>for social conditions, the same logic would apply to auditing fi rms to verify whether 
</p>
<p>they are in fact using greener technologies. Further discussion of how fi rms can 
</p>
<p>work with suppliers to enhance sustainability in the supply chain is provided in 
</p>
<p>Chap.   11     by van Weele and van Tubergen ( 2017 ) and Chap.   20     by Lee and 
</p>
<p>Rammohan ( 2017 ). 
</p>
<p> Extending the issues of green technology choice from a single fi rm to a supply 
</p>
<p>chain is certainly an interesting research direction with multiple questions  related   to 
</p>
<p>international trade (tariffs and export/import restrictions), accounting (allocation of 
</p>
<p>emissions), etc.&mdash;the subject is too broad for this chapter. But one immediate research 
</p>
<p>opportunity is in deeper understanding the total impact of green choices throughout 
</p>
<p>the value chains. For example, while incentives may be offered to a focal fi rm to 
</p>
<p>adopt a greener technology to convert its inputs into outputs, could there perhaps be 
</p>
<p>a &ldquo;greener&rdquo; way to process inputs by a supplier that would, even by keeping the focal 
</p>
<p>fi rm &ldquo;dirty,&rdquo; still result in a larger environmental/societal impact? Similarly, are there 
</p>
<p>ways to motivate consumers to use the products in a &ldquo;greener&rdquo; way?  
</p>
<p>12.9     Leakage of Unsustainable Practices to Areas with Low 
</p>
<p>Enforcement 
</p>
<p> When regulations in one  geographic   area are tightened, fi rms can either adopt a 
</p>
<p>greener technology in that region, or they can relocate production to a region with 
</p>
<p>less stringent regulation. In this context, &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; (e.g., carbon leakage) refers to a

</p>
<p>situation when a dirty process is relocated from a region in which emissions control 
</p>
<p>is enabled and enforced to a region where it is not. For example, with carbon pricing 
</p>
<p>in the European Union, some cement manufacturers may move their production to 
</p>
<p>Northern Africa (Drake  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> In the economics literature, this problem received a signifi cant attention, with 
</p>
<p>some studies arguing that the resultant emissions after  the   relocation could exceed 
</p>
<p>those prior to relocation, e.g., see Babiker ( 2005 ) who report an up to 30 % 
</p>
<p>increase. This is due to the fact that a stringent emission regulation in one region 
</p>
<p>could decrease the global demand for a particular product, hence decreasing it&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>global price and as a result increasing consumption in other regions (Felder and 
</p>
<p>Rutherford  1993 ). At the same time, other researchers pointed out that emissions 
</p>
<p>regulation would affect incentives to innovate and such an &ldquo;induced-technology 
</p>
<p>effect&rdquo; would counterbalance the negative impact of the leakage (Di Maria and van 
</p>
<p>der Werf  2008 ). 
</p>
<p> Various mechanisms have been proposed to minimize the negative impact of 
</p>
<p>leakage. Drake ( 2012 ) considers border adjustments: a form of an import tax levied 
</p>
<p>on a good produced in an un-regulated region that is being imported into a region 
</p>
<p>with emissions regulation. He shows that a symmetric border adjustment does not 
</p>
<p>fully eliminate leakage, but could lead to a situation where it induces the fi rm in the 
</p>
<p>unregulated region to adopt a cleaner technology than one in the regulated region 
</p>
<p>(this happens if the former has a cost advantage). As a result, the total emissions are 
</p>
<p>shown to decrease. 
</p>
<p> Sunar and Plambeck ( 2014 ) study the interaction between border adjustments 
</p>
<p>and allocation of emissions among co-products. They show that the way emissions 
</p>
<p>are allocated (such as based on products&rsquo; prices or weights) may have a signifi cant 
</p>
<p>impact on the effectiveness of border adjustments, and under some conditions, 
</p>
<p>increase rather than reduce the overall emissions. 
</p>
<p> Alev et al. ( 2014 ) consider another mechanism: the export ban. In a closed-loop 
</p>
<p>supply chain context, it is sometimes more profi table to export used products from 
</p>
<p>one market into another market, rather than remanufacture them. They show that, 
</p>
<p>under some conditions, such export bans may exacerbate the negative consequences 
</p>
<p>of extended producer responsibility regulations by providing manufacturers with an 
</p>
<p>incentive to interfere in the secondary markets and, by doing so, shorten the effec-
</p>
<p>tive useful life of their products. 
</p>
<p> As the leakage problems show,  the   question of green technology choice along a 
</p>
<p>supply chain is a complicated, multi-faceted issue that inevitably embeds all the 
</p>
<p>complications of real supply chains: that they consist of independent agents, in dif-
</p>
<p>ferent geographies, with different regulations, etc. This clearly expands the set of 
</p>
<p>challenges, but also the set of opportunities. Same as with the several preceding 
</p>
<p>sections, the most operationally effi cient opportunities for addressing sustainability 
</p>
<p>issues through technology choices may lie outside of the focal fi rm&rsquo;s scope of oper-
</p>
<p>ations. Returning back to the Scope 1-2-3 taxonomy outlined at the beginning of the 
</p>
<p>chapter, the researchers should consider broader sets of opportunities and questions 
</p>
<p>for technology choices at all the links in a supply chain.

<p>12.10     Conclusions: Rethinking &ldquo;Technology Choice,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Behaviors, and Lifestyle 
</p>
<p> This chapter surveys the research questions, approaches, and results surrounding a 
</p>
<p>broadly defi ned notion of green technology choice. Since the notion of &ldquo;technology 
</p>
<p>choice&rdquo; is very broad (e.g., one might argue that the location of the fi rm could be 
</p>
<p>viewed as a &ldquo;technology&rdquo;), the chapter focuses on the supply-chain view of the fi rm, 
</p>
<p>borrowing the well-known Scope 1-2-3 taxonomy pioneered by the Greenhouse 
</p>
<p>Gas protocol. 
</p>
<p> Starting with the economics and accounting aspects and the associated incentives 
</p>
<p>provided for green technologies, the chapter discussed the operational issues of 
</p>
<p>demand and supply variability and intermittency, as well as consumer reactions and 
</p>
<p>supply chain behaviors. Each of these sub-areas has excellent research studies and 
</p>
<p>open questions. But in the conclusion of the chapter, I would like to post a higher- 
</p>
<p>level, overarching question: are localized technology decisions globally optimal? 
</p>
<p>Specifi cally, shouldn&rsquo;t we (businesses, consumers, governments&mdash;society) move 
</p>
<p>from making pieces of our lives &ldquo;greener&rdquo; toward rethinking how to make the entire 
</p>
<p>life &ldquo;greener&rdquo;? 
</p>
<p> Returning back to the Wells Fargo example: it is of course laudable that they 
</p>
<p>installed solar panels and power their branches with renewable energy. But if their 
</p>
<p>employees or customers drive many miles to work every day, then these efforts are 
</p>
<p>a drop in a bigger &ldquo;sea&rdquo; of opportunities. The many research studies and examples 
</p>
<p>discussed in this chapter provide a roadmap for making sustainable choices, but I 
</p>
<p>believe that the next step is for people, rather than businesses to rethink day-to-day 
</p>
<p>behaviors. Academics could study innovative business models and incentives, busi-
</p>
<p>nesses could provide such innovative products and services, and governments could 
</p>
<p>provide incentive structures that would make the costs and benefi ts of using those 
</p>
<p>products more transparent. But my fi rm belief is that the biggest &ldquo;technology 
</p>
<p>choice&rdquo; opportunities are in rethinking lifestyles, in designing products and  services, 
</p>
<p>and in government policies, which would help people make more sustainable 
</p>
<p>choices.

<p> Principles of EcoDesign in Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Supply Chains

</p>
<p>13.1           Introduction 
</p>
<p> It is often said that the majority of environmental impacts of products occur during 
</p>
<p>the design stage, so efforts to make supply chains more sustainable should inevitably 
</p>
<p>include the product design process. In this chapter, we put EcoDesign in the broader 
</p>
<p>product design context and discuss some aspects of implementing EcoDesign in 
</p>
<p>companies. We then introduce ten &ldquo;Golden Principles&rdquo; (10GP) of EcoDesign and 
</p>
<p>provide an illustration of how they can be used to analyze and redesign a product. 
</p>
<p> How does EcoDesign fi t in the context of sustainable supply chains? If we sim-
</p>
<p>plify the concept of supply chain management (SCM), it is a matter of fl ows: fl ow 
</p>
<p>of money, goods, and information throughout the life cycle, from extraction of 
</p>
<p>materials via manufacturing, sales, use, and recycling. 
</p>
<p> Today, information might be the most important element in SCM in order to 
</p>
<p>achieve a true eco-effective product. Figures  13.1  and  13.2  illustrate the shift. Some 
</p>
<p>50 years ago, the products were made in a physical plant.  Material   was imported, 
</p>
<p>the products were made from start to fi nish within the plant, and in the end the full 
</p>
<p>product was delivered out through the factory gates. Today, companies are not char-
</p>
<p>acterized so much by fi xed physical locations as by moving activities where mate-
</p>
<p>rial, components, and money meet in different locations; what keeps things together 
</p>
<p>is information.
</p>
<p>    This shift puts strong demands on information in order to achieve sustainable 
</p>
<p>SCM (or eco-SCM). It is then necessary to understand the nature of &ldquo;eco&rdquo;  in   the 
</p>
<p>industrial environment. Figure  13.3  shows all the necessary elements of a product 
</p>
<p>design project and it is important to understand that &ldquo;eco&rdquo; is not the dominant part

</p>
<p>but still a major one. However, there must always be a compromise between all the 
</p>
<p>demands placed on the forthcoming product. Pugh ( 1991 , p. 5) refers to this as the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Design Core&rdquo;:
</p>
<p>   Total design may be construed as having a central core of activities, all of which are imper-
</p>
<p>ative for any design, irrespective of domain. Briefl y, this core, the design core, consists of 
</p>
<p>market (user need), product design specifi cation, conceptual design, detail design, manu-
</p>
<p>facture and sales. All design starts, or should start, with a need that, when satisfi ed, will fi t 
</p>
<p>into an existing market or create a market of its own.

<p>   The circle diagram in Fig.  13.3  illustrates all these demands connected to the 
</p>
<p>forthcoming product. 
</p>
<p> Even if environmental demands are important and crucial, there are a lot of other 
</p>
<p>demands to be considered as well. 
</p>
<p> This means that Eco-performance, as defi ned by Z&uuml;st ( 1996 ), is one of several 
</p>
<p>very important elements, which has to be balanced in the design core against other 
</p>
<p>functional and economic requirements. Environmental considerations have to be 
</p>
<p>incorporated into the design core without taking over (Z&uuml;st  1996 ). 
</p>
<p> Recycling and other environmentally imposed actions have to be related to all 
</p>
<p>the other elements in the design core without taking over, since environmental 
</p>
<p>demands will rarely have top priority.    Functionality of the product and profi t to the 
</p>
<p>company are examples of two aspects which always have very high priority, almost 
</p>
<p>always higher than environmental demands. Without customers buying a function 
</p>
<p>and companies making profi t, there will be no business, no matter the environmen-
</p>
<p>tal issue. Consequently, EcoDesign (also referred to as Design for environment) 
</p>
<p>may be defi ned as a practice by which environmental considerations are integrated 
</p>
<p>into product and process engineering design procedures, while maintaining product, 
</p>
<p>price, performance, and quality standards (Graedel and Allenby  2003 ). EcoDesign 
</p>
<p>has been extensively studied in the academic literature. We refer to Hatcher et al. 
</p>
<p>( 2011 ), Ilgin and Gupta ( 2010 ), and Ramani et al. ( 2010 ) for some reviews. The 
</p>
<p>readers may also refer to Bovea and P&eacute;rez-Belis ( 2012 ) for a review of the main 
</p>
<p>EcoDesign tools. The importance of EcoDesign is also recognized among compa-
</p>
<p>nies, although there may be confusion about the terminology. Short et al. ( 2012 ) ask 
</p>
<p>fi rms in Sweden and the UK whether design for sustainability should be part of their 
</p>
<p>product development process, and the vast majority of fi rms responding (97 % of 
</p>
<p>large fi rms in Sweden and 89 % of large fi rms in the UK) agree that it should. When

<p>13 Principles of EcoDesign in Sustainable Supply Chains</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>asked whether they practice a design for sustainability approach, the proportion 
</p>
<p>who said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; dropped, while even less confi rmed that they use an EcoDesign 
</p>
<p>approach. The conclusion is clear that there is widespread agreement about the need 
</p>
<p>to incorporate sustainability in product design, but less understanding of the corre-
</p>
<p>sponding approaches and terminology. This conclusion is in line with Karlsson and 
</p>
<p>Luttropp ( 2006 ) who highlight that answering to why we do EcoDesign is more 
</p>
<p>basic than how. 
</p>
<p> This chapter mainly focuses on this latter question by discussing some aspects of 
</p>
<p>implementing EcoDesign practices in companies. We organize the rest of the chap-
</p>
<p>ter as follows. Sect.  13.1  discusses the importance of design knowledge as a basis 
</p>
<p>for successful implementation of EcoDesign. Section  13.2  presents the key actors to 
</p>
<p>include in the EcoDesign process. Section  13.3  presents the 10GP of EcoDesign 
</p>
<p>and discusses these principles in the context of sustainable SCM. In Sect.  13.4 , we 
</p>
<p>show how to apply the 10GP for analyzing and Eco-redesigning two products. 
</p>
<p>Finally, Sect.  13.5  presents some conclusions. Design knowledge&mdash;a base for sus-
</p>
<p>tainable SCM. 
</p>
<p>    Education and experience are two main elements in design knowledge. Many 
</p>
<p>designers have a basic practical experience from youth by disassembling family 
</p>
<p>goods like toys, clocks, radios, vacuum cleaners, etc. and mending bicycles, school- 
</p>
<p>bags, sports equipment, etc. This gives a natural sense for gravity, strength, and 
</p>
<p>motion. Later, this practice is combined with formal education in engineering mat-
</p>
<p>ters. Most machine engineering educations are based on classical technical elements 
</p>
<p>like mechanics, materials, thermodynamics, etc. 
</p>
<p> This  is   visualized in Fig.  13.4  by the expression (1 + 1 = 2): one plus one is two 
</p>
<p>and nothing else! On this level, &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; is predominant and technical stu-
</p>
<p>dents with a new diploma have a preference for facts and correct answers rather 
</p>
<p>than tricky questions. After a few years of practical work, engineers come to amplify 
</p>
<p>their technical knowledge with experience and their real competence improves as a 
</p>
<p>combination of education and experience. Questions have been raised that don&rsquo;t 
</p>
<p>have a single correct answer. This is visualized in Fig.  13.4  with the statement 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;1 + 1 = (1:3)&rdquo;. One plus one equals something between one and three, rather than a 
</p>
<p>single number (Luttropp  1998 ).
</p>

</p>
<p>   Later, technical experience and education merge into intuition, refl ected by 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;1 + 1 = a&amp;b&rdquo;. Design knowledge is, at this point, more experienced as &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>than a set of technical laws and physical conditions. Technical competence is trans-
</p>
<p>formed into technical &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;. This status is monitored by Bragd in her study of 
</p>
<p>the development of the Volvo XC90 car and expressed as &ldquo;Tinkering&rdquo; (Bragd  2002 ).  
</p>
<p>13.2      Managing the EcoDesign process 
</p>
<p> To succeed with EcoDesigning, integration of environmental competence into the 
</p>
<p>product design process is essential, and early integration is the most effective. The 
</p>
<p>nature of competence varies between persons involved in EcoDesign and four dif-
</p>
<p>ferent competencies can be observed: consumers, designers, managers, and envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental specialists. 
</p>
<p>  Designers  need basic knowledge in environmental design and a network with 
</p>
<p>environmental specialists. Research carried out by Ehrenfeld and Lenox ( 1997 ) 
</p>
<p>shows that a good network including environmental specialists is essential for suc-
</p>
<p>cess in designing environmentally friendly products. Designers should not be the 
</p>
<p>specialist on environmental matters since the design core (see Fig.  13.3 ) contains a 
</p>
<p>lot of demands apart from environmental requests. There is an obvious risk that 
</p>
<p>being an environmental specialist makes the designer less skilled in other areas. 
</p>
<p>   Consumers    ideally need a good basic knowledge of environmental matters in 
</p>
<p>order to be a &ldquo;good&rdquo; customer. Choices by ordinary people often determine where 
</p>
<p>on the agenda environmental issues will appear (if at all). 
</p>
<p>   Managers    need basic knowledge about environmental matters concerning acqui-
</p>
<p>sition, design, legislation, etc. Managers are the key to EcoDesign since designers 
</p>
<p>cannot decide on environmental improvements on their own; it must be agreed on 
</p>
<p>by management as a part of broader decisions about product economics and 
</p>
<p>development. 
</p>
<p>   Environmental specialists    need deep knowledge of the environmental fi eld and a 
</p>
<p>good competence in current environmental analysis tools. Life Cycle Assessment 
</p>
<p>( LCA  )    is well-known (see also Chap.   2     by Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 )), but many 
</p>
<p>others exist. A specialist should also be well-trained in relevant Eco-design guide-
</p>
<p>lines and checklists, standards such as ISO 14000, and should have a good view of 
</p>
<p>current research related to EcoDesign. A basic task for the specialist is to transform 
</p>
<p>environmental demands into operational design requirements with a connection to 
</p>
<p>economy, legislation, acquisition, etc. One of the best ways to get competence in, for 
</p>
<p>example, LCA is to actually perform a full LCA as a part of the learning process. 
</p>
<p>Every product has one or two main functions, which are the reason why the product 
</p>
<p>is on the market. Environmental aspects can therefore rarely be higher than second 
</p>
<p>or third priority. A vacuum cleaner that does not suck up dust is of no use no matter 
</p>
<p>how environmentally friendly it is. Every designer has to fulfi l the main functions 
</p>
<p>fi rst and environmental demands second. An  environmental   dialogue must be present 
</p>
<p>in the company, and environmental specialists are a major resource in these actions.

</p>
<p>13.3      The Ten Golden Principles of EcoDesign in the context 
</p>
<p>of Sustainable Supply Chains 
</p>
<p> The 10GP by Luttropp and Brohammer ( 2014 ) are a tool developed to foster coop-
</p>
<p>eration by uncovering the  i  ntuitive design knowledge present in a product design 
</p>
<p>group. The 10GP is  an   enhanced version of the Ten Golden Rules (10GR) that has 
</p>
<p>been used in the EcoDesign education at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) in 
</p>
<p>Stockholm by the author since the early 2000s. The Ten Golden Rules were devel-
</p>
<p>oped by Luttropp as the &ldquo;lowest common denominator&rdquo; of ten of the most common 
</p>
<p>issues that must be addressed in EcoDesign (Luttropp and Lagerstedt  2006 , p. 1400). 
</p>
<p>Each of the Ten Golden Rules is generic and needs to be customized to the context; 
</p>
<p>the same is true for the 10GP. For instance, the fi rst Golden Rule is &ldquo;Do not use 
</p>
<p>toxic substances and utilize closed loops for necessary but toxic ones.&rdquo; As Luttropp 
</p>
<p>and Lagerstedt ( 2006 , p. 1402) point out, this could be customized to:
</p>
<p>&bull;      Identify which toxic substances are currently used in the product with 
</p>
<p>which you are working;  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Try to fi nd a nontoxic substitute that fulfi lls functional and economic 
</p>
<p>requirements of the product;  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Ascertain if closed loops are already established or can be developed and 
</p>
<p>utilized for recycling the materials including the toxic substances.    
</p>
<p>   Luttropp and Lagerstedt ( 2006 )    provide a detailed discussion of how the rules 
</p>
<p>were adopted and customized at Bombardier, using an iterative and participative pro-
</p>
<p>cess. The 10GP, discussed next, are an enhanced version of these Ten Golden Rules. 
</p>
<p> In this section, we discuss the 10GP of EcoDesign in the context of sustainable 
</p>
<p>SCM. For each of the Golden Principles, we explain how it applies to EcoDesign, 
</p>
<p>and why it is important in the context of EcoDesign. After introducing the Golden 
</p>
<p>Principles, we provide an illustrative example of how a keyboard and a cordless 
</p>
<p>drill were analyzed and redesigned using this approach.
</p>
<p>    GP1: Clarify product characteristics, functional and immaterial.  
</p>
<p> How: Identify which  functions   of the product are important and determine which 
</p>
<p>are directly linked to particular materials or material streams. The material 
</p>
<p>stream is then effectively a function of the function of the product. 
</p>
<p> Why: In redesigning a product, it is important to fi nd a balance between the func-
</p>
<p>tions the product (and hence the embedded materials) aims to provide and the 
</p>
<p>corresponding environmental impact of those materials.  
</p>
<p>   GP2:  Manage human resources   in a responsible manner without consuming them . 
</p>
<p> How: Keep track of and note how human resources are used throughout the life cycle, 
</p>
<p>both inside and outside the company. For example, designers can avoid using FeNdB 
</p>
<p>magnets when ordinary magnets are suffi cient for the current application since the 
</p>
<p>extraction of neodym (Nd) is creating problems for the work environment. 
</p>
<p> Why: Even when employees may not be perceived as the top priority in a supply 
</p>
<p>chain, the fi rm must ensure that the human resources along the life cycle are 
</p>
<p>healthy, as otherwise the market will perceive claims of sustainable SCM as 
</p>
<p>being hollow and thus potentially counterproductive.  
</p>
<p>C. Luttropp</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>309
</p>
<p>   GP 3: Minimize hazardous substances and arrange closed-loop systems for the 
</p>
<p>present ones.  
</p>
<p> How: Ask suppliers for a bill of materials (BOM), which is necessary for any 
</p>
<p>attempt to remanufacture the product.  In   practice, it is often hard to get a com-
</p>
<p>plete  BOM   since with semi-virtual products that are manufactured in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Fig.  13.2  no single entity has the entire BOM. 
</p>
<p> Why: Firms may face questions about RoHS compliance as well as REACH 
</p>
<p>reporting or possible toxic content of their product. Just asking and continuing 
</p>
<p>to do so starts a process towards a more visible knowledge of the total material 
</p>
<p>stream.  
</p>
<p>   GP 4: Ensure effi cient use of material resources with little generation of waste 
</p>
<p>and effi cient transportation.  
</p>
<p> How: Use recycled materials in manufacturing and measure/report how much goes 
</p>
<p>into the process. 
</p>
<p> One element in LEAN is effective transportation of materials and in this sense a part 
</p>
<p>of SSCM. Another LEAN element is low waste, which is eco-effective. From an 
</p>
<p>EcoDesign perspective, it is important to use recycled materials in products if 
</p>
<p>possible. Many companies claim use of recycled materials. With a less effective 
</p>
<p>production process, it is then possible to compensate by bragging that recycled 
</p>
<p>material is used when it is in fact production spills. The challenge is to fi nd mate-
</p>
<p>rials that have been in use and then returning into new products  
</p>
<p>   GP 5: Ensure that GP- related   costs are offset by an increase in GP-related 
</p>
<p>income.  
</p>
<p> How: Firms should try to keep account of both the additional costs and income that 
</p>
<p>is related to EcoDesign. (This is analogous to the requirement in Six Sigma to 
</p>
<p>quantify costs and benefi ts of individual projects.) 
</p>
<p> Why: Products designed following EcoDesign principles can provide various  ben-
</p>
<p>efi ts   to fi rms, including enhanced brand, which can carry over to the broader 
</p>
<p>portfolio of the fi rm. Without careful accounting, those benefi ts will not be 
</p>
<p>attributed to the EcoDesign process, making eco products appear more costly 
</p>
<p>than is appropriate.  
</p>
<p>   GP 6: Minimize energy consumption in use, especially for active products.  
</p>
<p> How. Ask what types of energy and how much energy is used throughout the  life 
</p>
<p>cycle  ; in the production of raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, power 
</p>
<p>in use, recycling, etc. Questions on these matters result in awareness and in turn 
</p>
<p>often act as a driver towards smaller/more effi cient use of resources. 
</p>
<p> Why. Active products are products with power consumption in use phase as most 
</p>
<p>signifi cant environmental impact. Typical active products are refrigerators and 
</p>
<p>classical cars. For these products, a lot is to be gained by lowering the power 
</p>
<p>consumption in use phase. Furniture are mostly inactive with most signifi cant 
</p>
<p>environmental aspect out of use phase. So, it is gainful to keep this product in the 
</p>
<p>use phase as long as possible.

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>310
</p>
<p>   GP 7: Avoid mixing materials and adopt a clear and obvious structure of 
</p>
<p>attachment joints and fraction borders.  
</p>
<p> How: Simplify  the   material composition of products and implement recycling- 
</p>
<p>friendly features in products (sometimes referred to as Design for Environment, 
</p>
<p>Design for Disassembly, etc.). Plan from the start of a product development pro-
</p>
<p>cess for a supply chain for recycled material at the same time as the classical 
</p>
<p>forward supply chain for virgin materials. 
</p>
<p> Why: The recycling of materials is a critical issue in sustainable supply chains. An 
</p>
<p>improved so-called  material hygiene (MH)   (a pedagogical concept aimed at 
</p>
<p>managing compromises to optimize materials use in products) leads to cleaner, 
</p>
<p>more effi cient and useful material streams.  
</p>
<p>   GP 8: Optimize the usage lifetime of products and promote repair and upgrading.  
</p>
<p> How: Firms should ensure that there is a system that takes care of discarded prod-
</p>
<p>ucts. They should try to maintain relationships with the product owner so that 
</p>
<p>recovery rates can be maintained at a level as high as possible. 
</p>
<p> Why: The shorter and shorter lifetime of products is perhaps the most important 
</p>
<p>challenge in EcoDesign. Doubling the useful lifetime will reduce the need for 
</p>
<p> recycling processes   by 50 %.  
</p>
<p>  GP 9: The product must be surrounded by a corresponding  environmental 
</p>
<p>culture  . 
</p>
<p> How: Make sure that everyone involved also acts in an environmentally correct 
</p>
<p>manner. Details such as reusable packaging may circulate backwards in the 
</p>
<p>value chain with discarded products or spillage. 
</p>
<p> Why: Environment is often seen as a somewhat ethical issue, which means that in a 
</p>
<p>sustainable supply chain one must also secure that the company culture is sup-
</p>
<p>porting the sustainability. It is important to &ldquo;walk the talk&rdquo;. If the company is not 
</p>
<p>supporting sustainability and just the products, the company can easily be per-
</p>
<p>ceived as hypocrite.  
</p>
<p>  GP 10: Ensure that the information IN the product, ON the product, and FOR 
</p>
<p>the product is correct and suffi cient. 
</p>
<p> How: Make sure that  the   information on the product clearly displays how to use it 
</p>
<p>in an  energy-effi cient manner  . Try to publish as much information as possible on 
</p>
<p>bills of material, transportation routes, etc. 
</p>
<p> Why: This will be regarded as respectful to the concerned eco-consumer and drive 
</p>
<p>towards more sustainable supply chains.     
</p>
<p>13.4      Golden Principle Analysis 
</p>
<p> One might be concerned that these EcoDesign principles are diffi cult to implement 
</p>
<p>in practice, especially when fi rms are facing many competing priorities. That is not 
</p>
<p>the case. To illustrate that, we provide two examples below of projects conducted 
</p>
<p>by graduate students in the EcoDesign course at KTH Stockholm. The students 
</p>
<p>analyzed and Eco-redesigned a keyboard (Alm et al.  2014 ) and a cordless drill

</p>
<p>(Andren et al.  2014 ). The products were analyzed according to  the   10GP to identify 
</p>
<p>relevant areas of improvement. Tables  13.1  and  13.2  and Figs.  13.5  and  13.6

</p>
<p> The company has low-wage workers in China, but also 
</p>
<p>have an outspoken agenda for Supply Chain

<p>Responsibility where procurement receives 
</p>
<p>responsibility training, direct employment of migrant 
</p>
<p>workers, limited weekly working hours, etc. 
</p>
<p>  3.   Toxic &mdash; Minimize   hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances and arrange

<p>  4.   Material resources &mdash;Ensure lean 
</p>
<p>production and effi cient transport 
</p>
<p> The production in this company is highly optimized. 
</p>
<p>Transport is mainly by ship which is relatively effective 
</p>
<p>  5.   Economy &mdash;Ensure that

</p>
<p>  6.   Energy &mdash;Minimize energy 
</p>
<p>consumption in use, especially 
</p>
<p>for active products 
</p>
<p> The energy consumption during use is very low relative 
</p>
<p>to the other stages of the life cycle 
</p>
<p>  7.   Material hygiene &mdash;Avoid mixing

<p> The circuit board is reused. This should have 
</p>
<p>positive effects since it is the most toxic part 
</p>
<p>  4.   Material  resources&mdash;Ensure  lean 
</p>
<p>  production and effi cient transport 
</p>
<p> Reusing circuit board reduces the amount of 
</p>
<p>material that is used 
</p>
<p>  5.   Economy &mdash;Ensure that GP-related 
</p>
<p>costs are offset by an increase in 
</p>
<p>GP-related income 
</p>
<p> The cost might increase slightly but the increase can 
</p>
<p>be offset by a reduction in the environmental 
</p>
<p>footprint due to reuse 
</p>
<p>  6.   Energy &mdash;Minimize energy 
</p>
<p>consumption in use, especially for 
</p>
<p>active products 
</p>
<p> No improvements by redesign 
</p>
<p>  7.   Material hygiene &mdash;Avoid mixing 
</p>
<p> materials   and adopt a clear and 
</p>
<p>obvious structure of attachment 
</p>
<p>joints and fraction borders 
</p>
<p> The number of materials that is used is reduced 
</p>
<p>when the metal plate is removed. The detachable 
</p>
<p>circuit board and break point makes the fraction 
</p>
<p>borders more obvious 
</p>
<p>  8.   Lifetime &mdash;Optimize the usage time 
</p>
<p>of products and promote repair and 
</p>
<p>upgrading 
</p>
<p> The lifetime is not extended but the detachable 
</p>
<p>circuit board facilitates repair and upgrades without 
</p>
<p>changing the entire product 
</p>
<p>  9.   Context &mdash;The product must be 
</p>
<p>surrounded by a  corresponding 
</p>
<p>  environmental culture 
</p>
<p> No improvements by redesign 
</p>
<p> 10.   Information &mdash;Ensure that 
</p>
<p>information IN the product, ON the 
</p>
<p>product, and FOR the product is 
</p>
<p>correct and  suffi cient   
</p>
<p> Adding labels for detachable circuit board, the 
</p>
<p>break point, and all plastic parts can simplify 
</p>
<p>recycling. HP can also market the redesigned 
</p>
<p>keyboard as partly reusable

<p> After implementing the redesigns,    the value-curve analysis is redone. The GPs 
</p>
<p>that have improved are indicated by yellow arrows in Fig.  13.6 .  
</p>
<p>13.4.2     Cordless Drill 
</p>
<p> The main goal  with   the improvements of the drill was to lengthen the lifetime and 
</p>
<p>make the disposal and recycling as simple as possible. 
</p>
<p> When analyzing the 10GP potential, improvements could be identifi ed. By sum-
</p>
<p>ming up the good and bad qualities of each golden principle, a clearer picture was 
</p>
<p>made and major problem areas could be recognized. In the diagram illustrated in 
</p>
<p>Fig.  13.7 , four areas are marked as the major problem areas; the toxic substances, 
</p>
<p>the material hygiene, the lifetime of the product, and the lack of information. 
</p>
<p> All of the big problem areas seemed to consist of similar suggested improvements. 
</p>
<p>Changing the rechargeable battery to disposable batteries could solve problems in 
</p>
<p>several of the principles. The existing battery in the cordless drill is a rechargeable 
</p>
<p>12 V NiMH-battery. The disadvantage using that type of battery is that it has to be 
</p>
<p>maintained in order to not deteriorate. The customer, being a regular household-
</p>
<p>member, will, as mentioned earlier, only use the product a couple of times a year. This 
</p>
<p>means that the user probably won&rsquo;t charge the battery as often as it should be charged 
</p>
<p>or maintain it as it should be maintained, and there could be a problem of the battery 
</p>
<p>deteriorating. By changing the battery to disposable  batteries, either several AA bat-
</p>
<p>teries, or other standard type batteries of higher voltage, the problem may be solved. 
</p>
<p>Another improvement that could be seen in several of the principles is the change of 
</p>
<p>the plastic materials in the construction. The polystyrene used in the majority of the 
</p>
<p>parts today has the disadvantage of being weak and easily crack, despite having addi-

<p>tives, which itself is a drawback in a recycling perspective. An improvement in this 
</p>
<p>case could be a material change, to use a polymer with better material properties and 
</p>
<p>better recycling potential. Another disadvantage of the product today is that it&rsquo;s dif-
</p>
<p>fi cult to disassemble. To simplify the recycling  process, the design should be changed 
</p>
<p>to consist of less parts and joints. The chuck was identifi ed as a problem-part and 
</p>
<p>should either be redesigned or delivered with better recycling information.  The   plas-
</p>
<p>tic materials and WEEE-cores should also have material and recycling labels.   
</p>
<p>13.5      Summary and Conclusion 
</p>
<p> The products business feasibility is basic and implies that environmental design 
</p>
<p>research and developed methods never will get acceptance from designers without 
</p>
<p>taking these elements into account. 
</p>
<p> The level of EcoDesign is set by the competence of the product developers. It is 
</p>
<p>therefore necessary to understand the nature of EcoDesign knowledge and to launch 
</p>
<p>EcoDesign tools that make it possible for designers to communicate on intuitive level. 
</p>
<p>  Designers and managers   have to cooperate in balancing environmental aspects, 
</p>
<p>market opportunities, technical possibilities, and economics. 
</p>
<p> The situation can be described in four points.
</p>
<p>&bull;    Environmental aspects must be integrated with technical possibilities, market, 
</p>
<p>and economics  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Designers and managers have to keep up an environmental dialogue  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Environmental demands must be transformed into operational design requirements  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Environmental subjects are fairly new, time and education will do a part of the trick

</p>
<p>      Firms engage in a variety of practices to manage their internal environmental 
</p>
<p>performance as well as those of their supply chains, and they promote those efforts 
</p>
<p>to concerned stakeholders (e.g., employees, suppliers, consumers, NGOs, and 
</p>
<p>shareholders). Montabon et al. ( 2007 ) categorize such practices at the operational, 
</p>
<p>tactical, and strategic levels. Examples of operational practices include recycling, 
</p>
<p>waste reduction, returnable packaging, etc. At the tactical level,    practices include 
</p>
<p>applying environmental standards to supplier selection, participating in environ-
</p>
<p>mental awards programs, and employing life cycle analyses. Strategic practices 
</p>
<p>include incorporating environmental impacts into the corporate mission and strate-
</p>
<p>gic planning process. 
</p>
<p> In addition to improving performance in the environmental dimension, environ-
</p>
<p>mental initiatives can result in increased sales, reduced costs, and mitigated risks, 
</p>
<p>thereby improving the market value of a fi rm and/or its supply chain partners. 
</p>
<p>However, the empirical evidence in the academic literature regarding the effects of 
</p>
<p>environmental initiatives is mixed. In this chapter, we address the following 
</p>
<p>questions:
</p>
<p>&bull;    Do environmental initiatives of the fi rm improve its market value?  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Does the impact on market value depend upon the specifi c type of environmental 
</p>
<p>initiative?  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Does the impact on market value depend upon the context or conditions sur-
</p>
<p>rounding the environmental initiative?

</p>
<p> For managers, these are key questions to consider not only when deciding 
</p>
<p>whether to undertake environmental initiatives, but also how to manage them and 
</p>
<p>communicate their progress. 
</p>
<p>14.1      Relationship Between Environmental Initiatives 
</p>
<p>and Market Value 
</p>
<p> The relationship  between   environmental initiatives and fi nancial performance or 
</p>
<p>market value is under debate in both the  business and academic communities  . For 
</p>
<p>example, Skapinker ( 2008 ) highlighted the proactive sustainability initiatives of 
</p>
<p>Unilever and Wal-Mart to frame the ongoing debate over whether such initiatives 
</p>
<p>are merely window dressing. Even though Wal-Mart&rsquo;s energy conservation and 
</p>
<p>recycling initiatives, and Unilever&rsquo;s forays into low-cost water purifi cation and eco- 
</p>
<p>friendly detergents, were well-received by the popular press, the question remains 
</p>
<p>as to whether the market perceives the returns on such initiatives to be as attractive 
</p>
<p>as returns on alternative investment opportunities. In other words, can a fi rm 
</p>
<p>increase market value through its environmental initiatives? Proponents claim that 
</p>
<p>direct economic benefi ts from environmental initiatives improve return on invest-
</p>
<p>ment and market value.  Benefi ts   include energy, raw material, and abatement cost 
</p>
<p>reductions, as well as intangible advantages of improved consumer perception, 
</p>
<p>community relations, employee morale, and access to new markets. Skepticism 
</p>
<p>remains, however, due to the perceived high costs of improving environmental per-
</p>
<p>formance and the uncertain and longer-term payoffs from such efforts (Engardio 
</p>
<p>et al.  2007 ). 
</p>
<p> Academics have studied the relationship between  environmental performance   
</p>
<p>and  fi nancial performance  , both theoretically (Walley and Whitehead  1994 ; Hart 
</p>
<p> 1995 ; Porter and van der Linde  1995 ) and empirically (Ullman  1985 ; King and 
</p>
<p>Lenox  2002 ; Margolis and Walsh  2003 ). Friedman ( 1970 ) argued that any environ-
</p>
<p>mental expenses beyond those required for regulatory compliance were not in the 
</p>
<p>best interest of shareholders and would result in degradation of fi rm performance 
</p>
<p>and value. However, Barnett and Salomon ( 2006 ,  2012 ) suggested that good corpo-
</p>
<p>rate social performance, of which environmental performance is a subset, attracted 
</p>
<p>resources to the fi rm, including better quality employees and expanded market 
</p>
<p>opportunities. Also, since proactive approaches to environmental performance 
</p>
<p>require greater intangible skills (e.g., cross-disciplinary activity and problem solv-
</p>
<p>ing) than do reactive approaches, related efforts created more valuable resources 
</p>
<p>and could be a source of competitive advantage (Hart  1995 ; Russo and Fouts  1997 ). 
</p>
<p>In contrast, Walley and Whitehead ( 1994 ) proposed that instances where environ-
</p>
<p>mental initiatives can improve fi rm performance were rare. 
</p>
<p> Although the dominant view today is that good environmental performance 
</p>
<p>results in improved  fi nancial performance   and market value, empirical results have 
</p>
<p>been inconclusive and even confl icting, which highlights the complex nature of the 
</p>
<p>link between environmental and fi nancial performance (Corbett and Klassen  2006 ).

</p>
<p>Related  empirical studies   that use secondary data are of three types: portfolio studies, 
</p>
<p>regression studies, and event studies (King and Lenox  2001 ; Guenster et al.  2006 ). 
</p>
<p>Portfolio studies determine whether the return on a portfolio of fi rms with compara-
</p>
<p>tively better environmental performance outperforms the market. Regression analy-
</p>
<p>ses determine the long-term relationships between environmental performance and 
</p>
<p>accounting-based measures of fi rm performance. These two  types   of studies require 
</p>
<p>careful matching of the fi rms under study with control fi rms to estimate any depar-
</p>
<p>tures from &ldquo;normal&rdquo; fi nancial performance during the study period. Due to the rela-
</p>
<p>tively long time periods over which such studies are conducted, they are sensitive to 
</p>
<p>the host of other possible explanatory factors of fi rm performance. 
</p>
<p> Event studies estimate market value impacts of fi rms using announcements of 
</p>
<p> environmental events  . A statistically signifi cant market reaction to announcements 
</p>
<p>of environmental events would indicate a causal link. Event studies have been used 
</p>
<p>in the literature to determine the impacts of both positive and negative environ-
</p>
<p>mental events, e.g., product and process-related initiatives (Gilley et al.  2000 ), 
</p>
<p>environmental awards and crises (Klassen and McLaughlin  1996 ), and lawsuits 
</p>
<p>(Karpoff et al.  2005 ). Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) documented the market 
</p>
<p>reaction to independent, third-party awards for environmental performance. Using 
</p>
<p>a sample of 140 announcements during the period 1986&ndash;1991, they found that 
</p>
<p>environmental awards were associated with a statistically signifi cant average mar-
</p>
<p>ket reaction of 0.63 %. Gilley et al. ( 2000 ) studied the market reaction to environ-
</p>
<p>mental activities that improve processes and products. Based on a sample of 71 
</p>
<p>announcements from  The Wall Street Journal  during 1983&ndash;1996, they found that 
</p>
<p>process-related announcements resulted in a statistically signifi cant average mar-
</p>
<p>ket reaction of &minus;0.45 %, but the market did not react signifi cantly to product-related 
</p>
<p>announcements. 
</p>
<p> We use the framework in Fig.  14.1   to   consider the impact of environmental ini-
</p>
<p>tiatives on fi nancial performance and market value. Researchers have proposed dif-
</p>
<p>ferent  mechanisms   by which environmental initiatives infl uence revenue gains and 
</p>
<p>cost reductions. An examination of these mechanisms illustrates how environmen-
</p>
<p>tal initiatives can impact market value.
</p>
<p>14.1.1       Revenue Effects 
</p>
<p> Revenue growth can be  achieved   either through gains in existing markets or access 
</p>
<p>to new markets. Klassen and McLaughlin ( 1996 ) proposed that gains in existing 
</p>
<p>markets could be realized through the reputational benefi ts of positive environ-
</p>
<p>mental performance. They argued that demonstration of reduced environmental 
</p>
<p>impacts of products and processes and the establishment of an environmental man-
</p>
<p>agement system (EMS) improved brand reputation. Dowell et al. ( 2000 ) also noted 
</p>
<p>that the development and maintenance of stringent environmental management 
</p>
<p>standards could have positive reputational effects. Corbett and Muthulingam 
</p>
<p>( 2007 ) proposed that a primary reason for fi rms to pursue Leadership in Energy

</p>
<p>and Environmental Design (LEED) certifi cation for building construction was to 
</p>
<p>signal environmental concern to regulators, employees, and the public. Brand rec-
</p>
<p>ognition and corporate reputation can also be enhanced through &ldquo;strategic philan-
</p>
<p>thropy&rdquo; to support environmental causes (Seifert et al.  2003 ). Similarly, other 
</p>
<p>environmentally conscious initiatives, such as alternative energy purchases or 
</p>
<p>investments to reduce emissions below regulatory requirements, can signal a fi rm&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>concern for the environment and can have a positive impact on corporate reputa-
</p>
<p>tion. For example, Cummins Inc. received a high ranking in the inaugural 
</p>
<p>Newsweek &ldquo;green&rdquo; survey due to its GHG reduction efforts ( Business Wire ,  2009 ). 
</p>
<p>Khanna and Damon ( 1999 ) found that desire for public recognition was a signifi -
</p>
<p>cant motivator for fi rms to voluntarily join the EPA Industrial Toxics Project aimed 
</p>
<p>at reducing hazardous chemical emissions. Improved recognition and reputation 
</p>
<p>could potentially lead to increased sales. In support, McGuire et al. ( 1988 ) demon-
</p>
<p>strated that sales growth  was   positively and signifi cantly related to corporate repu-
</p>
<p>tations for corporate social performance. 
</p>
<p> Improved environmental performance can also provide access to new markets. 
</p>
<p>Evolving environmentally conscious markets with their increasing desire for 
</p>
<p>eco- friendly products can lead to new sales opportunities (Porter and van der 
</p>
<p>Linde  1995 ). Examples range from high-fashion clothing produced with organic 
</p>
<p>materials (Binkley  2007 ), to hybrid vehicles and data centers that consume less 
</p>
<p>energy (Bulkeley  2007 ). US federal agencies, with $350 billion in annual pur-
</p>
<p>chases, are mandated to consider environmental criteria in their purchasing deci-
</p>
<p>sions (EPA  2008 ).

</p>
<p>14.1.2     Cost Effects 
</p>
<p> In addition to  its   effects on revenues, environmental initiatives can impact costs in a 
</p>
<p>variety of ways. Environmental practices reduce the amount of waste, the consumption 
</p>
<p>of various production inputs including energy and materials (Rothenberg et al.  2001 ; 
</p>
<p>Sroufe  2003 ), and the number of components in products (Ashley  1993 ). Given that 
</p>
<p>emissions could represent ineffi ciencies and waste of material or energy, their reduction 
</p>
<p>can also save input material and energy costs (Porter and van der Linde  1995 ). For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, Union Pacifi c&rsquo;s 15 % reduction in diesel emissions from 2000 to 2005 at their Davis, 
</p>
<p>California, rail yard was achieved by reducing fuel usage ( PR Newswire ,  2005 ). From a 
</p>
<p>supply chain perspective, both inbound and outbound logistics benefi t from reduced 
</p>
<p>product weights and packaging (Rao and Holt  2005 ). Dowell et al. ( 2000 ) note that strin-
</p>
<p>gent environmental standards can lower the cost to develop, maintain, and enforce poli-
</p>
<p>cies and procedures, thus allowing easy transfer of accrued knowledge and increasing 
</p>
<p>employee morale and productivity. Similarly, von Paumgartten ( 2003 ) argues that 
</p>
<p>LEED-certifi ed buildings can improve worker productivity and retention. Of course, not 
</p>
<p>all environmental improvements are cost-saving. If substitute input materials are more 
</p>
<p>expensive, costs would increase. As evidence, Kroes et al. ( 2012 ) fi nd that sulfur dioxide 
</p>
<p>emission reductions in utilities result in decreased fi nancial performance due to the use of 
</p>
<p>lower-sulfur but higher-cost coal. Further, if pollution prevention methods have been 
</p>
<p>exhausted and abatement must additionally be employed, costs will likely increase. 
</p>
<p> Pollution prevention may  not   only reduce disposal and mitigation costs, but may 
</p>
<p>also avoid the cost of installing and operating pollution control devices (Hart  1995 ; 
</p>
<p>Hart and Ahuja 1996). Such pollution control devices can be costly, as evidenced 
</p>
<p>by Reliant Energy&rsquo;s $50 million investment to reduce mercury emissions at its 
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania coal-fi red power plants ( Business Wire ,  2008 ). Other cost avoidance 
</p>
<p>benefi ts of effective environmental management include mitigation of risks of 
</p>
<p>losses from crises or regulation (Reinhardt  1999 ) and preventing expenses associ-
</p>
<p>ated with lawsuits and legal settlements (Karpoff et al.  2005 ). Risks of adverse 
</p>
<p>events can be decreased either by lowering the probability of occurrence, lessening 
</p>
<p>the cost impact of an event, or shifting responsibility to another party, usually via 
</p>
<p>insurance. By reducing or eliminating emissions, fi rms reduce the probability of 
</p>
<p>environmental crises such as spills, leaks, or contamination. As an example, after 
</p>
<p>suffering several expensive settlements and fi nes, DuPont pledged to eliminate the 
</p>
<p>use of perfl uorooctanoic acid ( Dow Jones News Service ,  2007 ).  
</p>
<p>14.1.3     Competitive Effects 
</p>
<p> Researchers  argue   that fi rm resources employed to achieve environmental initiatives 
</p>
<p>exhibit value, rarity, inimitability, or non-substitutability, the so-called &ldquo;VRIN&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>characteristics of the Resource Based View (RBV) outlined by Barney ( 1991 ). 
</p>
<p>As such, environmental initiatives can potentially create competitive advantage. 
</p>
<p>14 Market Value Implications of Voluntary Corporate Environmental Initiatives (CEIs)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>324
</p>
<p>Researchers have often attributed imperfect imitability to resources required for 
</p>
<p>improved environmental performance (e.g., Hart  1995 ; Russo and Fouts  1997 ). 
</p>
<p>Environmental initiatives resemble Total Quality Management (TQM) efforts in 
</p>
<p>that they are often accomplished via people-intensive, continuous improvement 
</p>
<p>processes. These resources are causally ambiguous and consistent with inimitabil-
</p>
<p>ity. Russo and Fouts ( 1997 ) argued that the culture and organization required for 
</p>
<p>environmental performance were also socially complex. New processes or tech-
</p>
<p>nologies often required for initiatives either might not be available to other fi rms 
</p>
<p>due to their proprietary nature, or they might require special skills to effectively 
</p>
<p>implement. A fi rm&rsquo;s announcement of an environmental initiative could be per-
</p>
<p>ceived as evidence that it possesses such valuable resources, helping it outperform 
</p>
<p>its competition.   
</p>
<p>14.2     Empirical Approach to Test the Relationship 
</p>
<p>Between Environmental Initiatives and Market Value 
</p>
<p> We employed  event   study methodology to estimate the market value impacts to 
</p>
<p>announcements of environmental initiatives. This methodology offers an approach to 
</p>
<p>estimate stock market returns associated with specifi c events, while controlling for 
</p>
<p>market-wide infl uences on stock prices (see Brown and Warner  1985 , for a review of 
</p>
<p>this methodology). The &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo; or &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; returns provide an estimate of the 
</p>
<p>percent change in stock price associated with an event. In an effi cient market, the 
</p>
<p>stock market reaction immediately refl ects the effects of any new information, includ-
</p>
<p>ing the announcement of an environmental initiative, on both current and future fi nan-
</p>
<p>cial performance. Thus, an estimate of fi nancial performance impact can be obtained 
</p>
<p>from changes in market value (stock prices) over a relatively short interval of time. 
</p>
<p>14.2.1     Data and Categorization of Environmental Practices 
</p>
<p> To develop  a   comprehensive list of environmental practices commonly employed in 
</p>
<p>business, we searched the business press for announcements related to Corporate 
</p>
<p>environmental initiatives (CEIs) and empirically determined the most frequently 
</p>
<p>occurring types. To generate our sample, we used a preliminary set of keywords to 
</p>
<p>collect a small set of announcements concerning environmental practices from dif-
</p>
<p>ferent publications. We read these announcements to identify additional phrases and 
</p>
<p>words that are commonly used in announcements of environmental initiatives. We 
</p>
<p>then used those keywords to search the headlines and lead paragraphs of announce-
</p>
<p>ments in the three major business wire services, the ten most widely circulated US 
</p>
<p>daily newspapers, and the leading European business daily during the period 2004&ndash;
</p>
<p>2006. We preserved all announcements that met the search criteria in these publica-
</p>
<p>tions and read the full text of each announcement. We excluded announcements that 
</p>
<p>were very minor in nature or duplicates of the same activity. 
</p>
<p>B. Jacobs et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>325
</p>
<p> Our fi nal sample comprised 780 announcements spanning 340 unique fi rms. The 
</p>
<p>sample had variation in fi rm characteristics, but was generally weighted toward 
</p>
<p>larger fi rms. The sample included fi rms from 63 unique three-digit NAICS codes, 
</p>
<p>thus representing a wide range of industries. 
</p>
<p> The fi rst obvious categorization was to separate out the self-reported corporate 
</p>
<p>efforts to avoid, mitigate, or offset the environmental impacts of the fi rm&rsquo;s products, 
</p>
<p>services, or processes. We refer to such announcements as Corporate environmental 
</p>
<p>initiatives (CEIs) (CEIs). The remaining second category is announcements about 
</p>
<p>recognition granted by third parties specifi cally for environmental performance. We 
</p>
<p>refer to such announcements  as   Environmental Awards and Certifi cations ( EACs  )   .  
</p>
<p>14.2.2      Corporate Environmental Initiatives (CEIs): 
</p>
<p>Subcategories 
</p>
<p> Considering our  CEI   sample more deeply, we identifi ed the following seven subcat-
</p>
<p>egories based on announcement content:
</p>
<p>&bull;     Environmental Business Strategies : Acquisitions of environmental-friendly 
</p>
<p>capabilities, joint ventures or alliances, and new corporate environmental poli-
</p>
<p>cies or standards.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Environmental Philanthropy : Substantial gifts for environmental causes, such as 
</p>
<p>conservation efforts; the majority of such announcements are cash gifts although 
</p>
<p>some are in kind.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Voluntary Emission Reductions : Pledges, investments, or achievements related 
</p>
<p>to reducing emissions levels beyond those required by regulation.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Eco-Friendly Products : Introductions of eco-friendly products, environmental 
</p>
<p>enhancements to existing products, or the incorporation of future regulatory 
</p>
<p>requirements into existing products.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Renewable Energy : Supply or purchase of power from alternative energy sources.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Recycling : Recycling of post-consumer waste and recycling to reduce raw mate-
</p>
<p>rial consumption.  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Miscellaneous : All remaining CEI announcements, including joining environ-
</p>
<p>mental groups or councils, engaging in energy conservation efforts, and develop-
</p>
<p>ing eco-friendly technologies.     
</p>
<p>14.2.3      Environmental Awards and Certifi cations: 
</p>
<p>Subcategories 
</p>
<p> We separated  our   EAC announcements  into   two certifi cation subcategories, namely, 
</p>
<p>ISO 14001 and LEED, and three award subcategories, namely, federal, state or local 
</p>
<p>government, and non-government. The awards mentioned in EAC announcements

</p>
<p>are specifi cally those given to recognize environmental performance, including pol-
</p>
<p>lution prevention, energy conservation, and habitat conservation. Table  14.1  pres-
</p>
<p>ents some examples of CEI and EAC announcements.
</p>
<p>14.2.4        Relevance to Operations and Supply Chain 
</p>
<p>Management 
</p>
<p> Our analyses of  the   text of CEI and EAC announcements clearly highlighted the oper-
</p>
<p>ations and supply chain issues involved in implementing environmental initiatives and 
</p>
<p>improving environmental performance. Using words from the text of the announce-
</p>
<p>ments, we recorded phrases representative of the issues being faced. We grouped 
</p>
<p>these issues into 13 operations and supply chain-related categories; we note that an 
</p>
<p>announcement may have multiple issues falling into different categories. Table  14.2  
</p>
<p>lists the operations and supply chain-related categories. Supply chain-related catego-
</p>
<p>ries include forward and reverse logistics, designing incentives and contracts for sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain alignment, and managing supply and demand. The table also indicates the 
</p>
<p>number of CEI and EAC announcements that fall into a particular issue category.
</p>
<p>14.3          Findings 
</p>
<p> For the full sample of 417 CEI announcements, we examined the abnormal stock 
</p>
<p>market returns for the day preceding the announcement, the day of the announce-
</p>
<p>ment, and the 2 days combined. The results indicated that the market  reaction   to

<p>CEI announcements is marginally positive but insignifi cant. Similarly, for the full 
</p>
<p>sample of 363 EAC announcements, the evidence suggested that the market does 
</p>
<p>not react signifi cantly to the entire category of EAC announcements. We also ana-
</p>
<p>lyzed the post-announcement abnormal returns of our sample fi rms to determine 
</p>
<p>whether a signifi cant market reaction occurred subsequent to our announcement

</p>
<p>Again, the results indicate that the market reaction to announcements of environ-
</p>
<p>mental initiatives is marginally positive but insignifi cant. 
</p>
<p> It appears that, as a broad and general category, environmental initiatives do not 
</p>
<p>necessarily translate into improved market performance. While the lack of a signifi -
</p>
<p>cantly positive result might be disappointing to environmental advocates, it is worth 
</p>
<p>noting that the result is not signifi cantly negative. In other words, decisions to 
</p>
<p>undertake environmental initiatives do not harm market value as some naysayers 
</p>
<p>may claim. Further, it is plausible that the market may not perceive all types of 
</p>
<p>environmental initiatives to be equally value creating. The market might react posi-
</p>
<p>tively, or not at all, depending on the initiative type. By aggregating environmental 
</p>
<p>initiatives of different types, the average reaction could well be insignifi cant. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, we next examined the relationship between specifi c types of environ-
</p>
<p>mental initiatives and market performance. 
</p>
<p>14.3.1     Relationships Between Specifi c CEI Types and Market 
</p>
<p>Value 
</p>
<p> We subdivided our CEI and EAC samples into the specifi c initiative types outlined 
</p>
<p>in Sects.  14.2.2  and  14.2.3 . We provide results for each of the seven CEI types in 
</p>
<p>Table  14.3  Panel A. For  the   environmental business strategies type, the mean abnor-
</p>
<p>mal return was positive and statistically signifi cant. However, the median and per-
</p>
<p>cent positive abnormal returns were insignifi cant. Taken together, the evidence 
</p>
<p>suggests that the market did not signifi cantly react to environmental business strat-
</p>
<p>egy announcements.
</p>
<p>   Our review of the literature suggests that the empirical evidence on the impact 
</p>
<p>of corporate philanthropy on  fi nancial performance   is mixed. Orlitzky et al. ( 2003 ) 
</p>
<p>found that corporate philanthropy had a positive relationship with accounting-
</p>
<p>based measures of fi nancial performance, while Wang et al. ( 2008 ) found that 
</p>
<p>fi nancial performance and market value were increasing in only low-to-moderate 
</p>
<p>levels of philanthropy. In contrast, Griffi n and Mahon ( 1997 ), Berman et al. 
</p>
<p>( 1999 ), and Seifert et al. ( 2004 ) did not fi nd a signifi cant relationship between the 
</p>
<p>two. In our analyses, we found that the mean, median, and percent positive abnor-
</p>
<p>mal returns for environmental philanthropy were all positive and statistically sig-
</p>
<p>nifi cant. The positive market reaction to environmental philanthropy could be 
</p>
<p>because such actions involve modest investments, but generate signifi cant cus-
</p>
<p>tomer goodwill and enhance corporate reputation, thus contributing to future 
</p>
<p>profi tability. 
</p>
<p> With regard to announcements of  voluntary emission reductions  , we found that 
</p>
<p>the mean, median, and percent positive abnormal returns were all  negative  and sta-
</p>
<p>tistically signifi cant. In other words, announcements of voluntary emission reduc-
</p>
<p>tions were viewed negatively by the market. This fi nding has some support in the 
</p>
<p>literature. In addition to the theoretical arguments of Friedman ( 1970 ) discussed 
</p>
<p>earlier, Hart and Ahuja ( 1996 ) suggested that while initial emission reductions

<p>14 Market Value Implications of Voluntary Corporate Environmental Initiatives (CEIs)</p>

</p>
<p>might improve fi nancial performance, subsequent reductions were more likely to 
</p>
<p>result from costly pollution control. Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn ( 2011 ) found that 
</p>
<p>membership in the EPA Climate Leaders program yielded a negative abnormal 
</p>
<p>return of &minus;0.90 %; the negative abnormal returns were even stronger when specifi c 
</p>
<p>pledges are made for greenhouse gas reductions. The Climate Leaders program was 
</p>
<p>referred to in 12 of the 39 announcements in our voluntary emissions reductions 
</p>
<p>subcategory; the remainder of the announcements within the subcategory related to 
</p>
<p>other air emissions or hazardous waste reductions. To further explore this negative 
</p>
<p>market reaction, we conducted additional analyses as described in Sect.  14.3.4 . 
</p>
<p> The  market reactions   for the four remaining CEI subcategories&mdash;eco-friendly 
</p>
<p>products, renewable energy, recycling, and miscellaneous&mdash;were statistically 
</p>
<p>insignifi cant.  
</p>
<p>14.3.2     Relationships Between Specifi c EAC Types and Market 
</p>
<p>Value 
</p>
<p> As seen from the results for each of the fi ve EAC  types   in Table  14.3  Panel B, the 
</p>
<p>market reaction was moderately positive to announcements of ISO 14001 certifi ca-
</p>
<p>tions. The median and percent positive abnormal returns were signifi cantly positive. 
</p>
<p>The literature offers some support for the positive impact of ISO 14001 in particular 
</p>
<p>and EMSs in general on fi rm performance, using survey data (Delmas  2001 ; Melnyk 
</p>
<p>et al.  2003 ). 
</p>
<p> Although our three measures of market reaction to LEED certifi cations were all 
</p>
<p>positive, they were statistically insignifi cant. Thus, despite the benefi ts of  LEED 
</p>
<p>certifi cation   cited in the literature (e.g., von Paumgartten  2003 ; Corbett and 
</p>
<p>Muthulingam  2007 ), the market reaction was insignifi cant. We conjecture that since 
</p>
<p>LEED certifi cations are awarded for individual buildings, their relatively narrow 
</p>
<p>scope may contribute to the lack of market reaction, particularly when compared 
</p>
<p>with ISO 14001 certifi cations that typically span different geographic locations or 
</p>
<p>even the entire fi rm. 
</p>
<p> While the average market reactions for both federal and state/local government 
</p>
<p>awards were statistically insignifi cant, the market reacted somewhat negatively to 
</p>
<p>non-government awards. The mean, median, and percent positive abnormal 
</p>
<p>returns were all signifi cantly negative. We found no substantive differences in the 
</p>
<p>types of behavior recognized by government versus non-government awards. Our 
</p>
<p>fi ndings of negative abnormal returns for non-government awards compared to 
</p>
<p>government awards seem consistent with fi ndings in the literature that less presti-
</p>
<p>gious and potentially less objective awards were valued less positively (Klassen 
</p>
<p>and McLaughlin  1996 ; Hendricks and Singhal  1996 ). An online search for award 
</p>
<p>criteria provided information for federal awards, but not for non-government 
</p>
<p>awards, suggesting that non-government award criteria are perhaps less transparent 
</p>
<p>and less formal. The negative market reaction could be because the market may 
</p>
<p>B. Jacobs et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>331
</p>
<p>perceive the efforts associated with such awards as unnecessary relative to the 
</p>
<p>value they provide.  
</p>
<p>14.3.3     Managerial Implications of Findings 
</p>
<p> Our fi ndings have a number of interesting  managerial implications  . First, the mar-
</p>
<p>ket was selective in reacting to types of environmental initiatives. Of the seven 
</p>
<p>CEI types considered in our analyses, the stock market reaction was largely insig-
</p>
<p>nifi cant for the following four categories: environmental business strategies, eco-
</p>
<p>friendly products, renewable energy, and recycling. The evidence suggests that 
</p>
<p>while the majority of CEI types were value-neutral, there were certain types for 
</p>
<p>which the market reaction was positive and certain types for which it was nega-
</p>
<p>tive, at least in the short term. Our results for CEIs are important as managers 
</p>
<p>often face pressures from various stakeholders to give consideration for environ-
</p>
<p>mental issues. Managers responding to such pressures can benefi t from empirical 
</p>
<p>evidence of what types of CEIs improve or at least do not negatively impact 
</p>
<p> market value. 
</p>
<p> Second, environmental philanthropy was viewed positively by the market. Such 
</p>
<p>philanthropy can generate positive publicity and goodwill among various stake-
</p>
<p>holders and can also create value through more loyal customers and highly moti-
</p>
<p>vated employees. Referring to Fig.  14.1 , environmental philanthropy is likely to 
</p>
<p>improve fi nancial performance via the revenue gains from enhanced reputation. 
</p>
<p>Given that the median value of philanthropic contributions by fi rms in our sample 
</p>
<p>is $2.0 million, the positive market reaction to environmental philanthropy suggests 
</p>
<p>that such initiatives can yield high returns. 
</p>
<p> Third, the market reacted negatively to voluntary emission reductions. These 
</p>
<p>results are consistent with earlier results that membership in the EPA Climate 
</p>
<p>Leaders program was associated with negative market reaction (Fisher-Vanden and 
</p>
<p>Thorburn  2011 ). Despite the benefi t in terms of mitigating future regulatory risks or 
</p>
<p>positively impacting reputation, the market remains concerned about announce-
</p>
<p>ments of voluntary emissions reductions. Referring to Fig.  14.1 , it is possible that 
</p>
<p>the market negatively values voluntary efforts at reducing emissions because of the 
</p>
<p>visibility of direct, assignable costs, while the revenue impacts of such efforts are 
</p>
<p>uncertain. Therefore, announcements of voluntary emissions reductions efforts 
</p>
<p>should be accompanied by formal justifi cations as to why these efforts are being 
</p>
<p>conducted (for example, preparing for future legislation, competitive lobbying, or 
</p>
<p>anticipated carbon trading) and what the expected value from these efforts is likely 
</p>
<p>to be. We discuss this fi nding further in Sect.  14.3.4 . 
</p>
<p> Fourth, with respect to EACs, we found that ISO 14001 certifi cations were asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with positive market reaction. This is validation of the value in achieving a 
</p>
<p>level of environmental commitment that is based on a widely recognized and 
</p>
<p>accepted international standard, and more so when the standard is sometimes 
</p>
<p>14 Market Value Implications of Voluntary Corporate Environmental Initiatives (CEIs)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>332
</p>
<p>considered as a prerequisite for trade. Thus, our results suggest that managers could 
</p>
<p>potentially use the ISO 14001 framework for developing an EMS. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the market reaction  to   environmental awards in our study is different 
</p>
<p>than in Klassen and McLaughlin ( 1996 ), who found signifi cant and positive market 
</p>
<p>reaction. Given that our sample is not an exact replication of Klassen and McLaughlin 
</p>
<p>( 1996 ), the difference in results could be due to sampling variances and/or the 
</p>
<p> different time periods. Our evidence indicates that LEED certifi cations and govern-
</p>
<p>ment awards are value-neutral, but non-governmental awards have a negative mar-
</p>
<p>ket reaction. While awards and certifi cations can serve as catalysts for organizational 
</p>
<p>change and innovative business practices, a key implication for managers seeking 
</p>
<p>to infl uence shareholder value through awards and certifi cations is to be judicious in 
</p>
<p>pursuing them. 
</p>
<p> In summary, although we  fi nd   that the market does not react to announcements 
</p>
<p>in the broad, aggregate categories of CEIs and EACs, we do fi nd signifi cant market 
</p>
<p>reactions for certain initiative types. Thus, it is important for managers to appropri-
</p>
<p>ately implement and communicate environmental strategies, as the effects on share-
</p>
<p>holder value can vary by type. Together with the communication of a sound, 
</p>
<p>economic rationale based on cost reductions, revenue gains, or reputational benefi ts, 
</p>
<p>certain environmental initiative types can positively impact shareholder value.  
</p>
<p>14.3.4       Contingencies Affecting the Relationship 
</p>
<p>Between Environmental Initiatives and Market Value 
</p>
<p> In this section, we consider whether the contexts or conditions surrounding the envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental initiative impacted the corresponding changes in market value. As previ-
</p>
<p>ously discussed, the literature reports mixed impacts of environmental initiatives on 
</p>
<p>fi nancial performance and market value. The mixed empirical evidence motivates 
</p>
<p>us to examine specifi c contingency factors that might be causing this ambiguity. 
</p>
<p>14.3.4.1     Achievements Versus Intents 
</p>
<p> Since self- disclosed   initiatives may not necessarily serve as measures of actual envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental performance, we considered whether the market reacts differently to 
</p>
<p>environmental initiatives that are &ldquo;achievements&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;intents&rdquo;. Since 
</p>
<p>announcements of environmental initiatives are signals of fi rms&rsquo; environmental 
</p>
<p>concerns, we consider their impact through the lens of signaling theory. A basic 
</p>
<p>tenet is that signal cost is an important infl uence on effi cacy; costly signals decrease 
</p>
<p>the likelihood of false signaling (Connelly et al.  2011 ). Since announcements of 
</p>
<p>achievement are actual realizations rather than plans, they are a higher cost signal 
</p>
<p>and, hence, more likely to be true and of greater reputational benefi t than announce-
</p>
<p>ments of intent. Hart and Ahuja ( 1996 ), King and Lenox ( 2001 ,  2002 ), and 
</p>
<p>B. Jacobs et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>333
</p>
<p>Matsumara et al. ( 2014 ), among others, use actual emissions data (i.e., achieve-
</p>
<p>ments) to demonstrate mostly positive effects of emissions reduction on fi nancial 
</p>
<p>performance and market value. However, Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn ( 2011 ) 
</p>
<p>examine pledges made (i.e., intents) when joining EPA Climate Leaders or the 
</p>
<p>Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) and fi nd a nega-
</p>
<p>tive stock market reaction. 
</p>
<p> We note that  EACs   are recognitions of achievement by defi nition. Hence, the 
</p>
<p>comparison between achievements and intents is not pertinent to EACs. Accordingly, 
</p>
<p>we only considered our CEI sample. We read the text of each CEI announcement to 
</p>
<p>separate out achievements of environmental performance from intents. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, the launch of an eco-friendly product is an achievement, whereas a plan to 
</p>
<p>design or produce such a product is an intent. We compared the mean and median 
</p>
<p>abnormal stock market returns for achievements and intents. The results showed a 
</p>
<p>moderately signifi cant and positive market reaction to achievements, but the reac-
</p>
<p>tion to intents was insignifi cant. Since achievements may more clearly signal either 
</p>
<p>realized or future cost reductions and/or revenue gains as compared to intents, a 
</p>
<p>greater focus in outward communications on achievements as opposed to intents 
</p>
<p>may be warranted. 
</p>
<p> As we saw in Sects.  14.3  and  14.4 , the market value impacts of CEIs can vary 
</p>
<p>substantially by specifi c initiative type. Accordingly, we consider one specifi c type 
</p>
<p>of CEI, voluntary emission reductions, to further examine the effects of achieve-
</p>
<p>ments versus intents. Recall that overall market reaction to voluntary emission 
</p>
<p>reductions was signifi cantly negative. Thus, if achievements are indeed clearer sig-
</p>
<p>nals, an achievement of voluntary emission reduction should have a greater  nega-
</p>
<p>tive  impact than an intent to reduce emissions. Using the same process described in 
</p>
<p>Sect.  14.1 , we greatly expanded the sample of voluntary emission reduction 
</p>
<p>announcements by collecting data over a 20-year period (1990&ndash;2009). The resulting 
</p>
<p>sample comprised 450 announcements. As we found in our initial analysis (see 
</p>
<p>Table  14.3 ), our analysis of the expanded sample indicated that announcements 
</p>
<p>were again valued negatively. However, and as predicted by signaling theory, 
</p>
<p>   announcements of intent were valued more positively than announcements of 
</p>
<p>achievement.  
</p>
<p>14.3.4.2     Time Dependence 
</p>
<p> Given that  researchers   using data from the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., Hart and Ahuja 
</p>
<p> 1996 ; King and Lenox  2002 ) found mostly positive effects of environmental perfor-
</p>
<p>mance on accounting-based measures of fi nancial performance, and that researchers 
</p>
<p>using data from the 2000s (e.g., Jacobs et al.  2010 ; Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 
</p>
<p> 2011 ) found more mixed results, we were prompted to consider whether the magni-
</p>
<p>tude and/or direction of fi nancial performance effects of environmental initiatives 
</p>
<p>have changed over time, contributing to the equivocal fi ndings in the literature. To 
</p>
<p>do so, we used the 20-year sample of voluntary emission reduction announcements 
</p>
<p>described above.

</p>
<p> Hart ( 1995 ) noted that during initial stages of emissions reduction, much &ldquo;low 
</p>
<p>hanging fruit&rdquo;&mdash;emissions that can be reduced easily and inexpensively&mdash;are gen-
</p>
<p>erally available but further reductions are subject to diminishing returns. Given that 
</p>
<p>fi rms have been reducing toxic emissions steadily since the initial release of TRI 
</p>
<p>data in 1986 and continuing through the 2000s (EPA  2011 ), much of the low hang-
</p>
<p>ing fruit has probably already been harvested. More recent environmental initiatives 
</p>
<p>are likely accomplished at increased marginal costs since advanced stages of emis-
</p>
<p>sions reduction often require more costly control or abatement techniques rather 
</p>
<p>than prevention. In support, the EPA ( 2008 , p. 5) found that the greatest barrier to 
</p>
<p>voluntary emission reductions was &ldquo;the perceived cost of emission reduction.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> In addition to fewer cost opportunities to exploit, emission reduction might have 
</p>
<p>also changed in value as a risk management strategy. If the regulatory environment 
</p>
<p>for emissions is toughening, the expectation of future liabilities associated with 
</p>
<p>emissions taxes, cap and trade systems, and/or stringent enforcement should 
</p>
<p>increase along with the risk management value of reducing emissions. However, as 
</p>
<p>per the World Economic Forum, the stringency of US environmental regulations 
</p>
<p>trended downward during the 2001&ndash;2008 period (Wijen and van Tulder  2011 ). 
</p>
<p>Marcus et al. ( 2011 ) argued that regulatory uncertainty continues to grow, increas-
</p>
<p>ing diffi culties in appropriate corporate planning. Such continued regulatory ambiv-
</p>
<p>alence in the US with respect to emissions has likely reduced the risk management 
</p>
<p>value of emission reduction. 
</p>
<p> Using abnormal  stock   market reactions to announcements of voluntary emission 
</p>
<p>reductions as our dependent variable, we employed stepwise WLS regressions to 
</p>
<p>assess the effects of time. The statistical tests demonstrate that stock market reaction 
</p>
<p>to voluntary emission reduction is negatively associated with time (see Fig.  14.2 ). 
</p>
<p>As depicted in Fig.  14.2 , this effect applies similarly to GHG and non- GHG 
</p>
<p>emissions, and it persists despite controlling for energy prices and other factors. 
</p>

GHG emissions from 1990 through 2009; lines represent predictions of WLS regression model

</p>
<p>This evidence is important to both researchers and managers as it highlights the 
</p>
<p>impacts of time-dependent characteristics of emissions reduction in particular.
</p>
<p>   In this study, we did not determine the precise time-related factors driving the 
</p>
<p>downward trend in shareholder value effects of fi rms announcing emission reduc-
</p>
<p>tions. As discussed above, the potential factors include diminishing availability of 
</p>
<p>easily reduced emissions (low hanging fruit), continued regulatory ambiguity in the 
</p>
<p>US, and diffusion of continuous improvement capabilities, among others. Given the 
</p>
<p>number of economic, environmental, and social factors that trend with time, the 
</p>
<p>specifi c causes of the negative time trend in abnormal returns are indeterminate and 
</p>
<p>require further study. 
</p>
<p> We note that the results presented here are valid only for the sample frame stud-
</p>
<p>ied and should not be extrapolated into the future. Just as economic, environmental, 
</p>
<p>and social conditions changed 1980&ndash;2009, they will continue to change, impacting 
</p>
<p>the market value impacts of emissions reductions (and other environmental initia-
</p>
<p>tives) to fi rms. For example, regulatory remedies such as limits or taxes on emis-
</p>
<p>sions, or market-based incentives such as cap-and-trade programs, could 
</p>
<p>substantially change the value proposition of environmental initiatives. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>increasing social demand for improved environmental performance could lead to 
</p>
<p>increased brand equity and revenues for environmentally conscious fi rms. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>as seen in Fig.  14.2 , the stock market reaction, although  trending   downward, appears 
</p>
<p>to be leveling out in recent years.    
</p>
<p>14.4      Future Research 
</p>
<p> There exist several avenues for fruitful future research. First, the very nature and 
</p>
<p>defi nition of environmental initiatives is continually evolving. The emergence of 
</p>
<p>new technologies, scientifi c discoveries, societal concerns, and the ever-changing 
</p>
<p>state of our natural environment all infl uence the adoption, growth, or diminishment 
</p>
<p>of specifi c environmental types. The core sample used in our analyses was collected 
</p>
<p>during 2004&ndash;2006. While all samples are time-limited by defi nition, this can be 
</p>
<p>especially problematic in the fast-changing world of sustainability. As illustrated by 
</p>
<p>the example of emission reductions announced over a 20-year period that we dis-
</p>
<p>cussed above, the market value impacts of those environmental initiatives are 
</p>
<p>dynamic and time-sensitive. Statistical evidence across time will inform managers 
</p>
<p>as to the changing nature of the market&rsquo;s assessment of environmental efforts. 
</p>
<p> Second, many environmental initiatives impact not only the focal fi rm, but also 
</p>
<p>its supply chain partners. For example, incorporating environmental performance 
</p>
<p> criteria in supplier selection might boost both environmental and fi nancial 
</p>
<p> performance for the entire supply chain. Such impacts are challenging to accu-
</p>
<p>rately defi ne and measure across multiple fi rms, but are grounds for interesting 
</p>
<p>future research. 
</p>
<p> Third, in this chapter we employed the stock market reaction as a proxy for the 
</p>
<p>fi nancial performance impacts of environmental initiatives. Although widely 
</p>
<p>14 Market Value Implications of Voluntary Corporate Environmental Initiatives (CEIs)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>336
</p>
<p>employed and well-established in the academic literature, the effectiveness of this 
</p>
<p>proxy is dependent on the generally accepted notion of market effi ciency. 
</p>
<p>Accounting-based measures of fi nancial performance such as ROA, ROE, or sales 
</p>
<p>growth can yield additional information on the specifi c mechanisms by which envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental initiatives impact fi nancial performance and are not dependent on market 
</p>
<p>effi ciency. 
</p>
<p> Fourth, beyond the value captured in the stock market reaction, it is plausible that 
</p>
<p>environmental initiatives may create value in other, intangible ways including 
</p>
<p>increased customer loyalty (measured as customer satisfaction, retention rate, or 
</p>
<p>word-of-mouth publicity), higher employee satisfaction, reputation within the com-
</p>
<p>munity, and long-term survivability, which are perhaps not fully refl ected in the 
</p>
<p>market&rsquo;s reaction to announcements. Consideration of the impacts of environmental 
</p>
<p>initiatives using a triple-bottom-line perspective could result in greater assigned 
</p>
<p>value to environmental initiatives and is another interesting direction for future 
</p>
<p>research. 
</p>
<p> In summary, this chapter examines the relationships between fi rm-level environ-
</p>
<p>mental initiatives and market value. We also outline the implications of our results 
</p>
<p>for researchers and managers and suggest avenues for future research. Research that 
</p>
<p>examines the effects, nuances, and limitations of fi rms&rsquo; environmental initiatives 
</p>
<p>will continue to be pertinent as society&rsquo;s demands on the natural environment con-
</p>
<p>tinue to grow.

<p>15.1          Introduction 
</p>
<p> This chapter uses a number of examples to detail how a series of path-dependent 
</p>
<p>decisions underpins the strategic trajectory of today&rsquo;s leaders in sustainable supply 
</p>
<p>chain management. A truly sustainable supply chain, could customers willing, oper-
</p>
<p>ate forever (Pagell and Wu  2009 ). Such a chain would at a minimum create no harm 
</p>
<p>and might even have positive or regenerative impacts on social and environmental 
</p>
<p>systems while maintaining  economic viability   (Pagell and Shevchenko  2014 ). True 
</p>
<p>sustainability is the end goal of SSCM, a goal which few, if any, supply chains, 
</p>
<p>especially those with tangible fl ows, presently meet. 
</p>
<p> The examples presented in this chapter are then leaders when compared to the 
</p>
<p>norms in their industry, but they are not truly sustainable. The fi rst key question 
</p>
<p>even these leaders need to answer is  what has to change in our supply chain to reach 
</p>
<p>true sustainability . This chapter offers insight, but the leaders of tomorrow will 
</p>
<p>need to build on these examples and those in the rest of the book if they are to sur-
</p>
<p>vive for multiple generations. 
</p>
<p> The awareness that today&rsquo;s leaders are far from the end goal of harm free produc-
</p>
<p>tion and distribution is one of two guiding assumptions for this chapter. The second 
</p>
<p>assumption is that the decisions managers make are path- dependent  . At its simplest 
</p>
<p>path, dependency means that previous decisions create constraints for decisions 
</p>
<p>made today (for more information see Pierson  2000 ). The assumption of path 
</p>
<p>dependency indicates that the further a supply chain travels along a strategic path or 
</p>
<p>trajectory, the more likely it is to stay on that trajectory because the costs of

<p> switching to a different trajectory become ever higher. For example, a supply chain

<p>that decides to outsource production has made path-dependent decision because it

<p>will be diffi cult, if not impossible, to bring production back in house in the future. 
</p>
<p>Hence, the initial drivers and values that lead a supply chain to pursue sustainability 
</p>
<p>also create future constraints (Wu and Pagell  2011 ) and limit future strategic 
</p>
<p>options. 
</p>
<p> This path dependency also raises questions. For managers in supply chains that 
</p>
<p>have already started to evolve and change to meet the needs of the future, the ques-
</p>
<p>tion becomes  how have previous decisions enhanced or limited our options ? For the 
</p>
<p>managers of supply chains just starting on their path to sustainability, the question 
</p>
<p>should be  how will the decisions we make today limit our options in the future ? To 
</p>
<p>answer these questions, the chapter will cover what we know about how supply 
</p>
<p>chains pursue sustainability, and then detail the three path-dependent trajectories 
</p>
<p>that supply chains follow when addressing sustainability; the balanced trajectory, 
</p>
<p>the focused trajectory, and the opportunity-fi rst trajectory.  
</p>
<p>15.2     What is Known:  The How and Why of Sustainability  
</p>
<p> Regardless of a supply chain&rsquo;s trajectory, managerial efforts to create a more sus-
</p>
<p>tainable supply chain typically support three main operational goals; increased effi -
</p>
<p>ciency, risk reduction, and innovation. Exemplar fi rms tend to try and achieve all of 
</p>
<p>these goals, and the goals are not mutually exclusive. This section details each of 
</p>
<p>these goals using examples. 
</p>
<p> One of the main goals of supply chain managers has always been to use resources 
</p>
<p>effi ciently to minimize the costs of providing  goods and services  . This mind-set has 
</p>
<p>proven useful in some sustainability-related initiatives as well; especially initiatives 
</p>
<p>that attempt to reduce the amount of environmental harm created by the supply chain. 
</p>
<p>Environmental harm tends to come either from using a non-renewable resource or 
</p>
<p>from pollutions that is created in the production, delivery, use, or disposal of the 
</p>
<p>chain&rsquo;s goods and services. So when supply chain managers can reduce the amount 
</p>
<p>of an input needed for production, they reduce the costs of production and the impact 
</p>
<p>on the environment. Similarly, pollution is in essence wasted resources. For instance, 
</p>
<p>when a fi rm sends material to the landfi ll it means it has bought materials that have 
</p>
<p>not been used in production and may even pay a second time for them to be disposed 
</p>
<p>of. Preventing or reducing pollution is often achieved by making more complete use 
</p>
<p>of inputs or by changing inputs, again reducing waste and environmental impacts. 
</p>
<p>This simultaneous achievement of reduced environmental harm and reduced costs is 
</p>
<p>referred to as  eco-effi ciency  (Sharma and Henriques  2005 ). 
</p>
<p> One of the more visible and successful eco-effi ciency efforts is 3M&rsquo;s Pollution 
</p>
<p>Prevention Pays program (3M  2014 ). This program is aimed at preventing pollution 
</p>
<p>at the source, rather than paying to clean it up after it is created and was started in 
</p>
<p>1975. Since then the company estimates that they have eliminated nearly 4 billion 
</p>
<p>pounds of pollution and saved nearly USD1.7 billion. 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>341
</p>
<p> The second way supply chains address sustainability is via  risk reduction  or 
</p>
<p> elimination  . Many environmental and social impacts can be viewed as risks, for 
</p>
<p>instance, the risk of an industrial accident harming the environment or workers and 
</p>
<p>disrupting the supply chain. Similarly, many supply chains decisions are made to 
</p>
<p>codify, understand, or reduce risk. 
</p>
<p> For instance, many fi rms have codes of conduct for their suppliers. These codes 
</p>
<p>are a form of  non-governmental regulation   in that they set standards and rules as to 
</p>
<p>what behaviours are unacceptable for suppliers, regardless of local laws. For exam-
</p>
<p>ple, many clothing and footwear supply chains have suffered because of customer 
</p>
<p>boycotts due to the way suppliers treat the environment or their workers (USAS 
</p>
<p> 2014 ). In response, organizations like Nike ( 2014 ) and Levis ( 2014 ) have created 
</p>
<p>codes of conduct. In doing so, they are trying to mitigate the risks associated with 
</p>
<p>unsustainable actions in the supply chain (see also Chap.   11     by van Weele and van 
</p>
<p>Tubergen ( 2017 ) and Chap.   20     by Lee and Rammohan ( 2017 )). 
</p>
<p> Finally, efforts to become truly sustainable require changing both products and 
</p>
<p>processes. These changes are a form of  innovation  and  innovation   can also be a 
</p>
<p>source of competitive advantage. For some fi rms, attempts to make the supply chain 
</p>
<p>sustainable have positive spill over benefi ts in that the same innovations that reduce 
</p>
<p>environmental and social harm also differentiate the chain from its competitors. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the Broad Group (Broad  2014 ) has developed innovative products for 
</p>
<p>cooling buildings that do not rely on electricity as well as a complete system for 
</p>
<p>creating more sustainable buildings. The fi rm differentiates itself by having unique, 
</p>
<p>more sustainable, products and services. 
</p>
<p> These three interrelated goals; eco-effi ciency, risk reduction, and innovation are 
</p>
<p>what supply chain managers pursue when making their chains more sustainable. In 
</p>
<p>the next section, we detail how the decisions made to improve the chain in one or 
</p>
<p>more of these areas, overtime, create unique path-dependent trajectories.  
</p>
<p>15.3     Findings and Practical Implications:  The Three 
</p>
<p>Trajectories  
</p>
<p> One of the guiding assumptions of this chapter is that it is the series of decisions 
</p>
<p>managers make that determine the supply chain&rsquo;s sustainability trajectory. Every 
</p>
<p>new process, decision to switch to less harmful materials, or redesign of products 
</p>
<p>will not only have operational implications in terms of waste, risk, and innovation, 
</p>
<p>but will also effect and be affected by the chain&rsquo;s strategic trajectory. 
</p>
<p> A supply chain&rsquo;s sustainability  strategy   can be examined from many perspec-
</p>
<p>tives. For instance, the Shared Value perspective (Porter and Kramer  2011 ) focuses 
</p>
<p>on how goods and services are tailored to meet the needs of customers while reduc-
</p>
<p>ing the harm from production and distribution. For example, when Pepsi works to 
</p>
<p>reduce the amount of water used in creating food and beverages, especially in parts 
</p>
<p>of the world where water is becoming scarce (Pepsi  2014 ), they are creating shared 
</p>
<p>value by allowing customers to continue to enjoy their products while making sure

</p>
<p>discuss how the stakeholder resource-based view can help make the concept of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;shared value&rdquo; more tangible.) 
</p>
<p> The strategic perspective taken in this chapter is different, in that we are not 
</p>
<p>focusing on any one decision, product, or process. Instead, the focus is on how sus-
</p>
<p>tainability was initially operationalized/introduced into the supply chain and how 
</p>
<p>the series of decisions managers make will, overtime, determine how/if true sustain-
</p>
<p>ability would develop in that specifi c supply chain. The decisions managers make 
</p>
<p>create a path-dependent trajectory that has implications for priorities and capabili-
</p>
<p>ties while also setting some limitations on future actions and outcomes. 
</p>
<p> There are three main trajectories or archetypes of sustainable supply chain man-
</p>
<p>agement; opportunity-fi rst, balanced, and focused. The trajectories are in essence 
</p>
<p>the way that sustainability is woven into the strategy and culture of the focal fi rm 
</p>
<p>and its supply chain.
</p>
<p>    In supply chains on a  balanced  trajectory,    sustainable behaviour is the way of 
</p>
<p>going about one&rsquo;s business day in and day out; and it positively and directly benefi ts 
</p>
<p>the employees, suppliers, and local communities. As a result,  environmental and 
</p>
<p>social issues   are highly integrated and equally important in these supply chains. 
</p>
<p> Strategically, these supply chains set limits on growth based on access to both 
</p>
<p>environmental and social resources. Typically, these chains would have much more 
</p>
<p>stable patterns of sales than their overall industry. In times of soaring demand, they 
</p>
<p>will not increase production beyond what their natural and human resources could 
</p>
<p>maintain in a downturn. This means they miss out on some sales in times of plenty, 
</p>
<p>but they do not deplete natural resources nor do they have to fi re people in down-
</p>
<p>turns. Hence, they miss some profi t and growth opportunities, at least in the short 
</p>
<p>term that the other chains would likely capitalize on. Supply chains on a balanced 
</p>
<p>trajectory are willing to internalize some of the environmental costs that are not 
</p>
<p>presently mandated by existing regulations to provide long-term benefi ts to employ-
</p>
<p>ees, suppliers, and the communities in which they operate. 
</p>
<p> Operationally,  the   balanced approach means that these chains are well placed to 
</p>
<p>be both eco-effi cient and innovative. The stability they foster means that workers

</p>
<p>are a long-term investment. These workers are highly trained and motivated to 
</p>
<p>make both continuous improvements in operations as well as to support innovations 
</p>
<p>when needed. Critically they are willing and able to share their knowledge through 
</p>
<p>the supply chain. Balanced fi rms can signifi cantly reduce the impact of production 
</p>
<p>processes (theirs and suppliers), while increasing effi ciency and offering better 
</p>
<p>working conditions for employees and overseas suppliers. These organizations are 
</p>
<p>able to attain resource effi ciency in many areas of their supply chains. 
</p>
<p> A leading company on a balanced trajectory is The Collins Companies, a forest 
</p>
<p>products enterprise headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon. It owns and manages 
</p>
<p>307,000 acres of timberland in Pennsylvania, Oregon, and California. While most 
</p>
<p>other wood product companies maximize yield by clear-cutting, Collins lets its for-
</p>
<p>ests grow naturally and uses selective harvesting. Since its creation in 1855, it has 
</p>
<p>maintained ethical forestry practices that have allowed the forests to thrive&mdash;and 
</p>
<p>provide lumber&mdash;for over 150 years. Their overriding operating principle is never 
</p>
<p>log more than the forest grows. 
</p>
<p> Collins was the fi rst privately owned  wood-products company   in the US to be 
</p>
<p>certifi ed by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), an international organization 
</p>
<p>with membership that includes NGOs, logging and wood-product companies, and 
</p>
<p>environmental groups. Throughout its operations, Collins is committed to maintain 
</p>
<p>the forest ecosystem and support social and economic benefi ts for its employees and 
</p>
<p>the surrounding communities. 
</p>
<p> The company&rsquo;s strong stance  on   environmental and social priorities subjects it to 
</p>
<p>risks and trade-offs. Collins will never use all their resources&mdash;there will always be 
</p>
<p>trees in reserve, but they may not always be able to meet demand. And while FSC 
</p>
<p>certifi cation raises their profi le, it is expensive to maintain those standards and it 
</p>
<p>may not repay those costs: lumber and building supplies are considered commodity 
</p>
<p>items, and most builders buy based on price, not environmental ideals. The com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s balanced approach to profi t, people, and planet may limit growth, but the 
</p>
<p>company factors its environmental and social involvement into its business plan. 
</p>
<p>Although the industry has declined in recent years, Collins has maintained a steady 
</p>
<p>workforce. 
</p>
<p> The steady workforce is critical to Collins and the communities they operate in. 
</p>
<p>Forestry is by nature a highly cyclical business with frequent downturns. Many of 
</p>
<p>their facilities are in rural settings where Collins may be the only major employer. 
</p>
<p>If Collins laid off people in every downturn, some towns would not survive. Stable 
</p>
<p>work then keeps people employed and allows small rural towns to survive industry 
</p>
<p>downturns. Balance allows Collins to protect their workers and the communities 
</p>
<p>they operate in and is a key to their ability to leverage the workforce. 
</p>
<p> Collins has leveraged the workforce to address sustainability mainly from an eco-
</p>
<p>effi ciency and innovation standpoint, which is exemplifi ed in the journey their 
</p>
<p>Klamath Falls facility (Oregon, US) has made since the mid-1990s. Collins  purchased 
</p>
<p>the facility from Weyerhaeuser. Until that point, Collins had concentrated its sustain-
</p>
<p>ability efforts on forest stewardship. However, in 1996, they implemented a program 
</p>
<p>they called Journey to Sustainability ( JTS  )    to bring sustainability to their manufactur-
</p>
<p>ing operations. By the next year, employees had begun sustainability training. Morale

</p>
<p>at Klamath Falls had dropped before the purchase by Collins, and the company  used 
</p>
<p>  JTS to boost the mood in the plant while improving operations. Supervisors received 
</p>
<p>training in the principles of sustainability and sustainable manufacturing. The com-
</p>
<p>pany implemented a plan to train all the workers within 3 months. The company 
</p>
<p>solicited suggestions while assessing improvements to its capital equipment. 
</p>
<p> One of the fi rst suggestions to arise was  to   adopt European standards for off- 
</p>
<p>gassing of formaldehyde from fi nished products (three times as stringent as US 
</p>
<p>requirements.) The company believes this has enhanced its position among &ldquo;enlight-
</p>
<p>ened&rdquo; architects, as well as opening potential new markets for its products. 
</p>
<p> The company stopped using water from the local river to improve resource effi -
</p>
<p>ciency and address regional water shortages. Their initial decision was to treat water 
</p>
<p>and reuse it. They leased a nearby farm and built a wetland to store and treat the 
</p>
<p>discharge, but it was too small to hold all of the treated water, forcing them to fi nd 
</p>
<p>a way to use some of it immediately. They realized that they could cut electricity 
</p>
<p>use by modifying their  heat exchange and cooling systems   to use the extra water. 
</p>
<p>The initial decision to stop taking water forced them to re-engineer production. The 
</p>
<p>new process not only uses less water, but also requires less energy to run, freeing up 
</p>
<p>capital. The experience also bolstered morale as workers saw immediate benefi ts in 
</p>
<p>terms of effi ciency and in their community&rsquo;s water supply. 
</p>
<p> A capital project at the plant signifi cantly reduced power use: they replaced six 
</p>
<p>old electric motors, saving $118,000 annually. It paid for itself in 2 years. Other 
</p>
<p>projects were similarly eco-effi cient. Condensate from a veneer dryer was used to 
</p>
<p>heat water, saving $152,000 per year. Maintenance and repair to steam traps saved 
</p>
<p>$25,000 per year. New equipment allowed sander dust to be incorporated into the 
</p>
<p>fi nished particleboard. The process saves $563,000 per year&mdash;and using the dust not 
</p>
<p>only improves the appearance of the board, but reduces air emissions. 
</p>
<p> The Klamath Falls facility not only cut water and energy consumption, it reduced 
</p>
<p>waste, as well. A contest to promote water conservation prompted discovery and 
</p>
<p>repair of a leak, saving over 500,000 gal per year. The plant no longer discharges 
</p>
<p>warm water into the river. The Journey to Sustainability has now been incorporated 
</p>
<p>into operations throughout the company. 
</p>
<p> In its fi rst year, Journey To  Sustainability   projects saved The Collins Companies 
</p>
<p>almost $1,000,000. Within 3 years, annual savings were $1,370,000&mdash;totalling over 
</p>
<p>$3 million. Capital purchases, salary increases, seminars, and travel came to about 
</p>
<p>$50,000&mdash;6 % of the overall savings. The environmental benefi ts come from 
</p>
<p>reduced use of resources, especially water in a community that faces water short-
</p>
<p>ages. This is also a social benefi t in that it will allow them to continue production 
</p>
<p>without putting other water uses in the community at risk. 
</p>
<p> The  path-dependent decisions   that Collins has made over the last 150 years allow 
</p>
<p>them to compete by being more sustainable, but these decisions also create 
</p>
<p> constraints. For instance, the stability of their forestry practices combined with the 
</p>
<p>investments in workers and communities means that operationally they are innova-
</p>
<p>tive and productive, but not very fl exible. Their supply chain is not able to deal with 
</p>
<p>large fl uctuations in demand. And given the investments in workers, practices, and 
</p>
<p>communities, any attempt to alter where work is done or who does it will have to be 
</p>
<p>M. Pagell and Z. Wu</p>

<p>345
</p>
<p>viewed through the lens of protecting the existing workforce and community. 
</p>
<p>Intuitively, this means they never want to close a plant in small town, even if there 
</p>
<p>are no legal constraints on doing so. Instead, the constraint is the intangible. To 
</p>
<p>close a plant in a small town means breaking the bound with the workers and com-
</p>
<p>munity and undermining their entire philosophy. 
</p>
<p> A balanced trajectory focuses on conserving social, environmental, and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic resources. Decisions to behave in this way often mean higher short-term 
</p>
<p>costs, weather they be investments in FSC or in training the workforce. However, 
</p>
<p>the payoff is the ability to continue to operate over very long timeframes. Collins is 
</p>
<p>not going to run out of  inputs   with their present business model, nor do they have to 
</p>
<p>worry about a dip in their demand causing an entire community to collapse.
    Supply chains on a focused trajectory have capitalized on  either   environmental 
</p>
<p>or social issues to create a viable business. For them, business success is contingent 
</p>
<p>on the accomplishment of environmental or social  objectives  . In supply chains on 
</p>
<p>an  environmentally focused  trajectory, the founders and managers will have strong 
</p>
<p>environmental values that have been imprinted on the organization. For instance, 
</p>
<p>Patagonia, a privately owned apparel company whose founders are self-proclaimed 
</p>
<p>climbers and surfers, has a mission statement to &ldquo; Build the best product, cause no 
</p>
<p>unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environ-
</p>
<p>mental crisis &rdquo; (  http://www.patagonia.com/eu/enSK/patagonia.go?assetid=8952    ). 
</p>
<p>These supply chains are a means to carry out a particular environmental agenda. 
</p>
<p>While these companies are engaged in community service and do discuss social 
</p>
<p>issues, tackling environmental issues is an essential part of business operations; 
</p>
<p>dealing with social issues is secondary.

</p>
<p> The   socially focused  trajectory   is similar, but in these supply chains the values 
</p>
<p>are socially oriented. Supply chains that have adopted Fairtrade certifi cation (  http://
</p>
<p>www.fairtrade.org.uk/en    ) as a primary means of certifying themselves or for select-
</p>
<p>ing suppliers would be on this trajectory since the primary objective of Fairtrade is 
</p>
<p>to improve the lives of farmers and farm workers. Socially focused organizations 
</p>
<p>take environmental action when the environmental impact of their business on peo-
</p>
<p>ple becomes a concern. In socially focused organizations, environmental initiatives 
</p>
<p>are adopted as a reaction to protect the organization, while in environmentally 
</p>
<p>focused organizations social initiatives will be adoptee reactively. 
</p>
<p> The major risk from  these   trajectories is then the lack of balance, but this can 
</p>
<p>also be a source of strategic strength.  The   environmental features of the products 
</p>
<p>and services offerings from environmentally focused supply chains communicate 
</p>
<p>certain environmental messages; energy effi ciency, reduced carbon footprint via 
</p>
<p>local food, and reductions in pollution associated with chemical fertilizers. 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, their innovative solutions to environmental challenges benefi t the cus-
</p>
<p>tomers directly via reduced energy consumption, a healthy living environment, and 
</p>
<p>high-quality products. Similarly, socially focused fi rms communicate messages 
</p>
<p>such as those associated with fair trade (Fairtrade  2014 ) or confl ict free (CFSI  2014 ) 
</p>
<p>and are innovating in ways that benefi t society in multiple ways such as better work-
</p>
<p>ing or living conditions. Thus, the companies with a focused trajectory can charge 
</p>
<p>a price premium. 
</p>
<p> Since the price premiums can offset the higher costs associated with social/envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental practices, managers are emboldened to take on more diffi cult tasks. From 
</p>
<p>the triple bottom-line perspective of performance, while all show a concern for all 
</p>
<p>elements of the triple bottom line, environmentally focused fi rms are primarily 
</p>
<p>motivated by a concern for the environment while socially focused fi rms are pri-
</p>
<p>marily motivated by a concern for society. 
</p>
<p> A leading company with an environmentally focused trajectory is Kettle Foods; 
</p>
<p>a multinational producer and distributor  of   organic and all-natural snack foods. 
</p>
<p>Kettle began in 1978 as the N.S. Khalsa Company, a small wholesaler of natural 
</p>
<p>snacks in Salem, Oregon. The company started producing its Kettle brand potato 
</p>
<p>chips in 1982. By the time the product line was a year old, the company had grown 
</p>
<p>to $3 million in annual sales. Founder Cameron Healy started the business in an 
</p>
<p>effort to earn a living that fi t with his spiritual values; those values dictated the &ldquo;all- 
</p>
<p>natural&rdquo; approach that still distinguishes the brand and underlies the company&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>strong environmental policies. By 1987, the Khalsa Company was growing at a 15 % 
</p>
<p>annual rate, with sales doubling every year. The following year, it changed its name 
</p>
<p>to Kettle Foods and established a UK branch in a converted factory in Norwich. 
</p>
<p> Kettle adopted  an   overarching operating principle that guides every decision the 
</p>
<p>company makes: the product has to be all natural and must contain what the label 
</p>
<p>says it contains. The company equates this principle with maintaining a strong envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental policy, so it infl uences how the company designs products, selects sup-
</p>
<p>pliers, and tracks ingredients in its supply chain. Strategically, they address 
</p>
<p>sustainability from an innovation perspective because their environmental focus 
</p>
<p>allows them to sell innovative/differentiated products at a price premium.

</p>
<p> Kettle&rsquo;s environmental focus also involves trade-offs. Some of their organic 
</p>
<p>ingredients are seasonal, but most grocery retailers do not stock products on a sea-
</p>
<p>sonal basis. Therefore, perishable ingredients have to be stored in refrigerated ware-
</p>
<p>houses to maintain a steady supply. The company&rsquo;s environmental decisions have 
</p>
<p>to be pragmatic, keeping sight of the fact that they must be both economically and 
</p>
<p>environmentally sustainable. This often means putting profi ts fi rst, at least in the 
</p>
<p>short term. Nonetheless, Kettle addressed environmental issues in their initial busi-
</p>
<p>ness plan, so their business and environmental agendas reinforce each other. 
</p>
<p> The environmental focus plays out operationally via efforts at creating eco- 
</p>
<p>effi ciency and at reducing risk. Kettle has a supplier certifi cation program that 
</p>
<p>demands extensive information from suppliers to ensure ingredients meet their stan-
</p>
<p>dards. This is explicitly  a   risk reduction activity since ingredients that do not meet 
</p>
<p>these standards would put their competitive advantage at risk. They do not trace 
</p>
<p>money through the supply chain or determine other practices (labour conditions, for 
</p>
<p>example) that are not directly related to a product&rsquo;s all-natural status. They choose 
</p>
<p>to focus on environmental issues and concerns. 
</p>
<p> The environmental ethos extends  to   their downstream and upstream supply 
</p>
<p>chains. As part of the commitment, Kettle uses sunfl ower and saffl ower oils. When 
</p>
<p>the oil is spent, it is converted into biodiesel. By using the fuel in its delivery fl eet, 
</p>
<p>the company reduces its CO 2  emissions by 8 t every year and does not have to pur-
</p>
<p>chase fuel, which is a classic example of eco-effi ciency. Kettle has taken other steps 
</p>
<p>to reduce emissions. In September 2003, they partnered with the Energy Trust of 
</p>
<p>Oregon and Portland General Electric to install one of the largest grid-tied solar 
</p>
<p>photovoltaic arrays in the Pacifi c Northwest. Six hundred rooftop solar panels gen-
</p>
<p>erate more than 120,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity per year, enough to 
</p>
<p>reduce annual CO 2  emissions by 65 t. The company offsets the rest of its electricity 
</p>
<p>use in the US by purchasing wind energy credits, preventing more than 13,000 t of 
</p>
<p>emissions. Citing these achievements, the EPA presented its Green Power 
</p>
<p>Partnership award to Kettle in 2012. The  Salem plant   has also restored surrounding 
</p>
<p>wetlands, clearing invasive plants and reintroducing native species. As birds and 
</p>
<p>other wildlife returned, the company installed pathways and benches to encourage 
</p>
<p>the public&rsquo;s use and enjoyment of the land. 
</p>
<p> In 2007, Kettle opened the fi rst LEED &reg;  Gold certifi ed food manufacturing plant 
</p>
<p>in the US in Beloit, Wisconsin. The &ldquo; green building&rdquo;   reduces energy use by 20 % 
</p>
<p>compared to conventional construction, saving $110,000 on natural gas and $51,000 
</p>
<p>on electricity. By reclaiming and reusing water, the plant saves over 3.4 million 
</p>
<p>gallons of water a year. The facility also converts 3200 gal of waste oil to biodiesel 
</p>
<p>each month. Finally, elimination of shipping lines between Oregon and the Midwest 
</p>
<p>further cut the company&rsquo;s CO 2  emissions by more than 3 million pounds per year. 
</p>
<p> The decision to protect the fi rm&rsquo;s environmental values via the all-natural principle 
</p>
<p>has allowed Kettle to grow while selling products at a price premium. But this same 
</p>
<p>path-dependent decision also creates serious constraints. At its simplest, Kettle cannot 
</p>
<p>use some ingredients even if they are less expensive or have a smaller carbon footprint. 
</p>
<p>It also means that to sell into markets where customers expect a product to be available 
</p>
<p>year round, Kettle ends up storing ingredients, often in temperature- controlled settings

</p>
<p>with large costs and environmental footprints. These actions are antithetical to the 
</p>
<p>fi rm&rsquo;s environmental ethos, so it is no surprise that they work hard to mitigate all of 
</p>
<p> their   environmental impacts. However, their resources like most fi rms are not unlim-
</p>
<p>ited. The efforts they have put into their operations have created a unique environmen-
</p>
<p>tal management capability. But every investment in this environmental capability is 
</p>
<p>also a decision not to make a similar- sized investment in social sustainability capabili-
</p>
<p>ties. The decision to embrace an all-natural principal to protect the environmental val-
</p>
<p>ues leads to the creation of a proactive environmental management capability, which 
</p>
<p>they use to create and maintain their competitive advantage. However, every invest-
</p>
<p>ment in the all-natural path also makes it harder to embrace/invest in other areas due  to 
</p>
<p>  resource constraints and knowledge gaps. 
</p>
<p> Kettle exemplifi es the focused trajectory. The organization was founded to meet an 
</p>
<p>environmental objective which translates into their all-natural strategy; a strategy 
</p>
<p>which allows them to charge a price premium which helps to pay for their range of 
</p>
<p>eco-innovations. And over time, they have become very adept at recognizing opportu-
</p>
<p>nities to make environmental innovations, be it converting a waste stream into fuel or 
</p>
<p>harnessing renewable energy. Similarly, their risk reduction efforts are aimed mainly 
</p>
<p>at protecting their trajectory. This focus has been profi table and allowed them to grow, 
</p>
<p>but it is not balanced. They do address social issues, but this is not their strategic 
</p>
<p>advantage. Over time, their focus on  the   environmental impacts of the supply chain 
</p>
<p>has made the chain an exemplar in reducing its environmental impact, but  this   focus 
</p>
<p>requires resources, resources that are not applied to social issues in the same manner.

</p>
<p>    The  opportunity-fi rst   trajectory   is largely driven by an economic opportunity. 
</p>
<p>Unlike the previous two trajectories, where environmental or social values play a 
</p>
<p>leading role in shaping the supply chain&rsquo;s operations, here the causality is reversed. 
</p>
<p>Opportunity-fi rst trajectories occur when a business motive pushes an existing 
</p>
<p>chain to adopt additional initiatives that will inculcate environmental or social val-
</p>
<p>ues into the organization. 
</p>
<p> For existing supply chains, this is the most common trajectory. Organizations 
</p>
<p>such as Coca-Cola, Unilever, and GE, which existed for generations with a profi t 
</p>
<p>maximizing ethos mainly, have made business decisions to become more sustain-
</p>
<p>able that have put them onto the opportunity-fi rst trajectory. The opportunity-fi rst 
</p>
<p>trajectory enjoys many of the marketing and branding benefi ts of the focused trajec-
</p>
<p>tory, but these supply chains are not able to charge the same price premiums. 
</p>
<p> The opportunity-fi rst trajectory is different on three main accounts, all of which 
</p>
<p>exemplify the path-dependent nature of decisions surrounding sustainability. First, 
</p>
<p>the sustainability values in this trajectory are recent, which suggests that when faced 
</p>
<p>with decisions where being more sustainable is expensive or risky, these supply 
</p>
<p>chains are less likely to make the investment. This is buttressed by a second key 
</p>
<p>difference: the opportunity-fi rst supply chain was already in the market place as a 
</p>
<p>traditional (not sustainable) competitor. Customers already associate the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion&rsquo;s products and services with specifi c attributes including prices, and these cus-
</p>
<p>tomer expectations will be slow to change, which can limit the ability to charge a 
</p>
<p>price premium, especially in the short term. Prior decisions create dependencies that 
</p>
<p>infl uence both how current investments are viewed and interestingly how customers 
</p>
<p>view the supply chain. 
</p>
<p> Finally, over time, customers, employees, and other stakeholders of the 
</p>
<p>opportunity- fi rst trajectory will come to expect more responsible behaviour. What 
</p>
<p>starts as a business opportunity will have to evolve to something more because 
</p>
<p>stakeholders expect that a supply chain that claims to be more responsible is truly 
</p>
<p>responsible in all of its actions.  By   announcing their intentions to take advantage of 
</p>
<p>a sustainable business opportunity, supply chains are opening themselves up to 
</p>
<p>much greater scrutiny and higher expectations. Taking the fi rst step towards becom-
</p>
<p>ing more sustainable creates a path dependency where the supply chain will have to 
</p>
<p>take many more such steps to maintain support from their stakeholders. 
</p>
<p> Workers in  a   company or chain tend to be motivated when the chain becomes 
</p>
<p>more responsible, but they also begin to question why social or environmental 
</p>
<p>issues that make the fi rm money are addressed while other negative impacts are not. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, customers who respond to a more sustainable message will begin to ask 
</p>
<p>deeper questions about other practices, demanding ever more change. Protecting 
</p>
<p>and growing the brand effectively means that chains on an opportunity-fi rst trajec-
</p>
<p>tory will likely have to migrate toward the  balanced trajectory , otherwise they may 
</p>
<p>fail. This is a critical point since the opportunity-fi rst trajectory is the one on which 
</p>
<p>most existing fi rms will address sustainability. 
</p>
<p> Walmart exemplifi es the opportunity-fi rst trajectory. With over 11,000 stores in 71 
</p>
<p>countries and a global workforce of 2.2 million, Walmart is the largest retailer in the 
</p>
<p>world. When Walmart undertakes a change that affects its supply chain(s), that

</p>
<p>change infl uences industry sectors globally. So it is with the company&rsquo;s sustainability 
</p>
<p>policies. In 2005, CEO Lee Scott announced the company&rsquo;s new business sustain-
</p>
<p>ability strategy, designed to meet three sweeping environmental goals: to be powered 
</p>
<p>by 100 % renewable energy, to create zero waste, and to sell products that &ldquo;sustain 
</p>
<p>people and the environment.&rdquo; While these were &ldquo;aspirational&rdquo; rather than concrete 
</p>
<p>goals with defi nite timelines, their achievement would require major changes in how 
</p>
<p> Walmart   managed its global supply chains. 
</p>
<p> The fi rst two goals (renewable energy and zero waste) are very much about  eco- 
</p>
<p>effi ciency and innovations   in supply chain operations, which align well with 
</p>
<p>Walmart&rsquo;s existing low price strategy that is based on supply chain effi ciencies. 
</p>
<p> Walmart   closely tracks numbers across its supply and distribution channels as well 
</p>
<p>as in its retail centres, so it has statistics on its progress toward its measurable goals. 
</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2014, it had over 300 renewable energy projects underway 
</p>
<p>worldwide, providing 2.2 billion kWh a year. Additional purchases of renewable 
</p>
<p>power bring the company to 24.2 % of its energy goal. In the US, more than 81 % of 
</p>
<p>their waste is now diverted from landfi lls. In Japan and the UK, the number is over 
</p>
<p>90 %. The company offers electronics recycling at its US stores, along with smart-
</p>
<p>phone and tablet trade-in programs. While all these projects benefi t the environ-
</p>
<p>ment, they also cut operating costs in terms of energy expenditures and landfi ll fees. 
</p>
<p>In addition, recycled materials provide new revenue streams&mdash;including 56 million 
</p>
<p>pounds of recovered cooking oil used in biodiesel or animal feed. 
</p>
<p>  Energy and waste issues   are business opportunities where innovative processes 
</p>
<p>allow them to become more eco-effi cient and these initiatives extend to the entire 
</p>
<p>supply chain. In 2008, Scott announced  a   drive to bring suppliers into compliance 
</p>
<p>with fair labour practices and cut energy consumption by 20 % throughout the sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain. He also stated that the company would drop suppliers who did not meet 
</p>
<p>these goals. 
</p>
<p> Walmart offers a range of  educational and training programs   to suppliers to help 
</p>
<p>them to meet these targets. Violation Correction Training requires a factory repre-
</p>
<p>sentative to attend classes where approaches to social and environmental issues and 
</p>
<p>compliance methodologies are explained. The suppliers are expected to choose and 
</p>
<p>implement the procedures that fi t them. Orange School provides hands-on training 
</p>
<p>to select factories and suppliers. By focusing on the fundamentals of root cause 
</p>
<p>analysis and procedures, Walmart teaches suppliers to identify noncompliance 
</p>
<p>issues proactively and develop systematic approaches to continuous improvement. 
</p>
<p>Walmart has invested heavily in these training programs, but the onus remains on 
</p>
<p>the suppliers to comply. 
</p>
<p> Walmart provides a good example of both positives and limits of the opportunity- 
</p>
<p>fi rst trajectory. As Walmart becomes more eco-effi cient, other issues become more 
</p>
<p>not less pertinent to external stakeholders. The company would of course like to 
</p>
<p>focus on positives like their reduced footprint, decreased reliance on non-renewable 
</p>
<p>energy, and everyday low prices. But external stakeholders have raised a litany of 
</p>
<p>serious complaints about the fi rm; some of which have resulted in legal action. 
</p>
<p> For instance, Walmart is Mexico&rsquo;s largest private employer, with over 220,000 
</p>
<p>workers and 2200 locations. Walmart has more than once resorted to bribery to 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>351
</p>
<p>obtain building permits in Mexico&mdash;in one case, to open a store just a mile from a 
</p>
<p>culturally signifi cant site: Teotihuac&aacute;n, an ancient Aztec that contains a temple 
</p>
<p>complex and two pyramids (Bloomberg  2014 ; NYT  2012 ,  2014 ). And in the United 
</p>
<p>States, the company is harshly criticized for its anti-union policies, poor working 
</p>
<p>conditions, inadequate healthcare, and low wages (Berfi eld  2012 ). In addition, some 
</p>
<p>of Walmart&rsquo;s recent expansion plans have been greeted by protesters who were 
</p>
<p>concerned that Walmart would ruin, not enhance their community (e.g. LA Times 
</p>
<p> 2012 ). Some of these issues arose long before Walmart started on their path to 
</p>
<p>becoming more sustainable, but these issues become more pertinent as the organi-
</p>
<p>zation tries to capitalize on its sustainability progress. 
</p>
<p>  Walmart has made   signifi cant progress and somewhat paradoxically now faces 
</p>
<p>even more pressure to change. They can&rsquo;t have it both ways&mdash;if they are truly trying 
</p>
<p>to reduce the impact of their supply chain, they will have to evolve into one of the 
</p>
<p>other trajectories; or lose trust from multiple stakeholders (suppliers, customers, 
</p>
<p>regulators, etc.) as well as sales. In a sense, Walmart will soon face a crossroad; they 
</p>
<p>have been very successful at making their existing unsustainable business model 
</p>
<p>more resource effi cient, but in doing so they have actually increased their exposure. 
</p>
<p>To be truly sustainable, they will have to continue to learn and respond to pressures 
</p>
<p>to make changes that may not create shared value. 
</p>
<p> The  path-dependent nature   of sustainability decision is most apparent in the 
</p>
<p>opportunity-fi rst supply chains. By capitalizing on an opportunity, Walmart, like all 
</p>
<p>supply chains on an opportunity-fi rst trajectory, has also created new constraints 
</p>
<p>and expectations. By signalling their progress, they have in essence increased the 
</p>
<p>external pressure on the chain. This is the fundamental paradox of the opportunity- 
</p>
<p>fi rst supply chain, the more they do and the more transparent they become, the more 
</p>
<p>that will be expected. 
</p>
<p> Supply chains on an opportunity-fi rst trajectory will be indispensable in sustain-
</p>
<p>ability for two reasons. First, sustainability has to make sense for companies with 
</p>
<p>such scale to have a signifi cant impact. Second, this is the way the vast majority of 
</p>
<p>existing, presently unsustainable, supply chains will fi rst address sustainability. 
</p>
<p>But, opportunity-fi rst organizations also need to recognize that, over time, they will 
</p>
<p>have to do more than embrace the  business   opportunity; they will have to funda-
</p>
<p>mentally change.  
</p>
<p>15.4     Conclusions 
</p>
<p> This chapter explored the various ways in which supply chains are or could approach 
</p>
<p>sustainability. It starts with two critical pieces of knowledge. First, that no fi rm has 
</p>
<p>yet created a truly sustainable supply chain, and second, that the choices made to 
</p>
<p>reduce a chain&rsquo;s impacts will create path dependencies. 
</p>
<p> This starting point leads to a pair of questions all managers will need to ask. The 
</p>
<p>fi rst is &ldquo; what has to change in our supply chain to reach true sustainability &rdquo;. Supply 
</p>
<p>chain managers answering this question focus on three interrelated means to 
</p>
<p>15 Business Implications of Sustainability Practices in Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>352
</p>
<p> reducing impacts; eco-effi ciency, risk reduction, and innovation. As the chapter has 
</p>
<p>shown, many fi rms are making signifi cant progress in these areas and these exam-
</p>
<p>ples offer starting points for managers looking for inspiration. 
</p>
<p> However, managers looking to begin the journey toward sustainability or those 
</p>
<p>looking to make further progress in their supply chains need to remain aware of 
</p>
<p>the way past decisions limit future options. The chapter explores the three main 
</p>
<p>paths or trajectories in which sustainability is embedded into a supply chain, and 
</p>
<p>the trade-offs inherent in each. Balanced chains are just that, but by focusing 
</p>
<p>equally on all aspects of the triple bottom line, they risk not having the market 
</p>
<p>advantages of focused chains, which are truly leaders at something, even if 
</p>
<p>focused chains are also laggards in other areas. Similarly, chains that use a mar-
</p>
<p>ket opportunity as the initial spur to become more sustainable will, somewhat 
</p>
<p>paradoxically, need to be aware that as they make progress more, not less will be 
</p>
<p>demanded of them.

<p>16.1          Introduction 
</p>
<p> Traditionally,  economic growth and prosperity   have been linked with the availabil-
</p>
<p>ity, production, and distribution of tangible goods as well as the ability of consum-
</p>
<p>ers to acquire such goods. Early evidence regarding this connection dates back to 
</p>
<p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s  Wealth of Nations  (1776), in which any activity not resulting in the 
</p>
<p>production of a tangible good is characterized as &ldquo;unproductive of any value.&rdquo; Since 
</p>
<p>then, this coupling of economic value and material production has been prevalent in 
</p>
<p>both developed and developing economies throughout the world. 
</p>
<p> One unintended consequence of this coupling has been the exponential increase 
</p>
<p>in the amount of solid waste being generated. The reason is that any  production and 
</p>
<p>consumption   of material goods eventually generates the equivalent amount of 
</p>
<p>(or even more) waste. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that, with today&rsquo;s manu-
</p>
<p>facturing and supply chain management technologies, it has become cheaper to 
</p>
<p>dispose and replace most products rather than to repair and reuse them. This has 
</p>
<p>given rise to what some call a &ldquo;disposable society.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> To put things in perspective: In 2012, households in the UK generated approxi-
</p>
<p>mately 22 kt of waste, which amounted to 411 kg of waste generated per person 
</p>
<p>(Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs  2015 ). During the same time 
</p>
<p>period, households in the US generated 251 megatons of waste, which is equivalent 
</p>
<p>to a person generating approximately 2 kg of waste every day (U.S. Environmental

</p>
<p>Protection Agency  2012 ). Out of these 251 Mt of total waste generated, approxi-
</p>
<p>mately 20 % of the discarded items were categorized as durable goods. The disposal 
</p>
<p>of durable goods is particularly worrisome because they are typically produced 
</p>
<p>using material from non-renewable resources such as iron, minerals, and petroleum- 
</p>
<p>based raw materials. 
</p>
<p> It is clear that any business model that relies on a disposable society cannot be 
</p>
<p>sustainable long-term model. For this reason, recent efforts have been made by pol-
</p>
<p>icy makers to enable the creation of a &ldquo;circular economy,&rdquo; which minimizes waste 
</p>
<p>by re-using, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling materials and products (European 
</p>
<p>Commission  2014 ). While doing so can minimize the amount of waste produced 
</p>
<p>and promote a more effi cient and ecofriendly use of overall resources, the creation 
</p>
<p>of a circular economy does not really address the source of the problem&mdash;it is  con-
</p>
<p>sumption   that is the source of most wastes. Thus, reducing consumption can result 
</p>
<p>in decreased production and less waste. 
</p>
<p> One solution to the disposable-society problem, proposed by the 
</p>
<p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Offi ce of Resource Conservation and 
</p>
<p>Recovery (see U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  2009 ), is for traditional 
</p>
<p>product- based fi rms to move towards more service-based business models that do 
</p>
<p>not focus on selling products but rather on selling the solutions that the products can 
</p>
<p>deliver. A potential benefi t of such models is that a fi rm can always maintain the 
</p>
<p>ownership of the products it manufactures, thus reducing the incentive to increase 
</p>
<p>revenue by simply selling more products. Moreover, switching the base of the trans-
</p>
<p>action, from the product level to the use level, can restructure the economics of 
</p>
<p>consumption and encourage more sustainable level of product use. In this chapter, 
</p>
<p>we examine the potential of such a solution from both an economic and environ-
</p>
<p>mental perspectives. 
</p>
<p> The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In Sect.  16.2 , we fi rst provide 
</p>
<p>examples of fi rms that have transitioned from a product-based state to a service- 
</p>
<p>based state and then we introduce the concept of servicizing. In Sect.  16.3 , we dis-
</p>
<p>cuss some reasons why  traditional product-based fi rms   may be interested in 
</p>
<p>transitioning to a more service-based delivery strategy and how this transition may 
</p>
<p>impact a fi rm&rsquo;s sustainability metrics. In Sect.  16.4 , we discuss some of the chal-
</p>
<p>lenges fi rms may face when making this transition and some of the key decisions 
</p>
<p>that are required for doing so. We conclude in Sect.  16.5  and provide some possible 
</p>
<p>directions for future research.  
</p>
<p>16.2      From Products to Services: The Transition 
</p>
<p>Through Servicizing 
</p>
<p> In this section, we describe how certain companies have made the transition from 
</p>
<p>being product-based to being service-based. We also link such a transition to what 
</p>
<p>has recently become known as servicizing strategies.

</p>
<p>16.2.1     Leaving the &ldquo;Product Comfort Zone&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> The service sector has been  an   integral part of economic activity in both developed 
</p>
<p>and developing economies. In 2013, services accounted for approximately 80 % of 
</p>
<p>GDP in the US (The World Bank  2013 ). During the same period, in China the ser-
</p>
<p>vice sector continued to grow to 46.9 % of GDP, a dynamic that may indicate the 
</p>
<p>move to a new stage in China&rsquo;s economic growth (Businessweek  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Although such statistics are commonly used in texts describing the role of ser-
</p>
<p>vices in today&rsquo;s economy, another observation may help put a more interesting 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;face&rdquo; on these numbers. In particular, for many years organizations that are (or 
</p>
<p>were) typically recognized as manufacturing/product fi rms have been increasing the 
</p>
<p>service component of their offerings. Examples include GM&rsquo;s successful creation of 
</p>
<p>the OnStar subscription service or its expansion to fi nancial services through the 
</p>
<p>acquisition of AmeriCredit Corp. in 2010 to create what is known today as GM 
</p>
<p>Financial. Similarly, SKF, the Swedish manufacturer of ball and roller bearings, 
</p>
<p>now offers subscription-based diagnostic and predictive maintenance services (SKF 
</p>
<p> 2014 ). Dell and Hewlett-Packard created Dell Services and HP Enterprise Services, 
</p>
<p>respectively, in order to provide IT and business services. These moves came in 
</p>
<p>response to earlier moves by IBM, who has almost entirely transformed itself from 
</p>
<p>a product-based company into a services company by selling its personal computers 
</p>
<p>and servers business to Lenovo ( 2004 ; IBM  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> But why do  manufacturers   choose to go out of their &ldquo;product comfort zone&rdquo; to 
</p>
<p>engage and invest in the creation of services? In the face of product commoditization 
</p>
<p>and increasing competitive pressure, services can offer a stable and recurring revenue 
</p>
<p>stream stemming from activities such as support, maintenance, and repair, which can 
</p>
<p>extend well beyond the useful life of a product and generate lucrative profi t margins. 
</p>
<p>This can also increase the chances of cross-selling or alleviate customers&rsquo; hesitation in 
</p>
<p>upgrading to new products and equipment. Additionally, by offering after-sales sup-
</p>
<p>port services, manufacturers can eliminate the need for third parties, who can erode 
</p>
<p>brand perception, to perform these services. Furthermore, services are more diffi cult to 
</p>
<p>reverse-engineer (i.e., to be imitated) and can facilitate longer and deeper relationships 
</p>
<p>with customers due to longer contractual agreements. Manufacturers can also obtain a 
</p>
<p>better idea about the customers&rsquo; needs and the conditions under which the products 
</p>
<p>operate and possibly customize their offerings accordingly. Finally, by offering ser-
</p>
<p>vices the manufacturers can acquire more accurate feedback about the performance of 
</p>
<p>their products in the fi eld, which can lead to product improvements and redesigns.  
</p>
<p>16.2.2     The Strategy of Servicizing 
</p>
<p> In the aforementioned examples, regardless of whether the  manufacturers   offer a 
</p>
<p>support (e.g., maintenance) or an &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; (e.g., OnStar) service, the base of the 
</p>
<p>transaction remains at the product level. This is because the service is contingent on 
</p>
<p>the customers purchasing a product. However, in recent years we have observed a 
</p>
<p>16 Moving from a Product-Based Economy to a Service-Based Economy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>358
</p>
<p>trend where manufacturers from various industries have started switching their 
</p>
<p>focus from selling products to actually selling the solutions that their products offer. 
</p>
<p>In most of the cases, manufacturers maintain the ownership of the products; there-
</p>
<p>fore, the base of the transaction no longer seems to be the product per se, but rather 
</p>
<p>the use of the product. This trend, also known as &ldquo;servicizing,&rdquo; 1  indicates the transi-
</p>
<p>tion from a product-based economy to a functional or solutions economy (Stahel 
</p>
<p> 1994 ). In such an economy, instead of buying chemicals, for example, customers 
</p>
<p>now have the option to buy chemical management services; instead of buying copi-
</p>
<p>ers, they can buy document reproduction services; and instead of buying  cars  , they 
</p>
<p>can buy mobility services (see Fig.   16.1  ). Such options can be particularly attractive 
</p>
<p>to customers because they free them from the administrative hassles and the operat-
</p>
<p>ing risks (e.g., maintenance, repair) as well as the fi nancial risks (e.g., depreciation 
</p>
<p>of a product&rsquo;s market value) associated with product ownership.
</p>
<p>   The strategy of servicizing involves the transition from an existing business 
</p>
<p> model   to one where the focus is on the service or, better put, the solution provided 
</p>
<p>to the end-customer. In fact, most business models can be thought of as comprising 
</p>
<p>a combination of a product and a service component (see Fig.   16.2  ). A newly formed 
</p>
<p>defi nition in the academic literature describes these models under the general term 
</p>
<p>Product Service Systems ( PSS  )   . The defi nition of  PSS   varies throughout the 
</p>
<p> literature, but most authors agree that there exist three different PSS types 
</p>
<p>(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  2009 ): (1) product-oriented PSS in which a 
</p>
<p>manufacturer, in addition to selling a product, includes extra services (e.g., after- 
</p>
<p>sales service), (2) use-oriented PSS in which the manufacturer maintains ownership 
</p>
<p>of the product and sells the use or availability of it (e.g., leasing, rentals, car shar-
</p>
<p>ing), and (3) result-oriented PSS in which the manufacturer and the customer agree 
</p>
<p>on a certain result or performance level (e.g., engine up-time).
</p>
<p>1   There is an abundance of similar terms like &ldquo;servicization&rdquo; or &ldquo;servitization.&rdquo; We have chosen to 
use the term &ldquo;servicizing&rdquo; like many before us, without making any claims about its superiority or 
grammatical correctness!

</p>
<p>   The above typology is by no means exhaustive, and some business models may 
</p>
<p>fall under more than one type. For instance, the business  model   of fractional owner-
</p>
<p>ship (often found in the private jet industry; NetJets was among the fi rst to offer 
</p>
<p>such a model), where customers own only a fraction of an asset that entitles them to 
</p>
<p>a certain amount of use, can be thought of as a combination of product-oriented and 
</p>
<p>use-oriented PSS. In this chapter, we avoid possible categorization conundrums and 
</p>
<p>simply describe models in which the use, rather than the ownership, of the products 
</p>
<p>governs the relationship between manufacturers and customers. To avoid an overly 
</p>
<p>cumbersome use of terminology and unnecessary confusion, we refer to such mod-
</p>
<p>els as servicizing business models. 
</p>
<p> One of the most celebrated examples of a successful servicizing business model 
</p>
<p>in the  academic literature   is Xerox&rsquo;s document management services (Xerox  2015 ), 
</p>
<p>where customers are charged on a per-use (per-page-printed) basis (see Fischer 
</p>
<p>et al.  2012 ). In the automotive sector, servicizing has emerged through the business 
</p>
<p>model of car sharing. Under car sharing, customers obtain access to a fl eet of vehi-
</p>
<p>cles after paying a small annual fee. Upon joining the service, customers can check 
</p>
<p>the availability of the vehicles and make reservations online. After using a vehicle, 
</p>
<p>they pay only for the reserved amount of time. Although the most well-known car 
</p>
<p>sharing provider is Zipcar, several auto manufacturers such as BMW, Peugeot, and 
</p>
<p>Ford have entered the car sharing arena through small, pilot programs across the 
</p>
<p>world. The most prominent and fastest-growing car sharing program offered by an 
</p>
<p>auto manufacturer is Car2Go, a subsidiary of Daimler AG, which operates in sev-
</p>
<p>eral cities across the US and Europe. 
</p>
<p> An example of a servicizing model in the aviation sector is offered by Rolls- 
</p>
<p>Royce, who pioneered Power-by-the-Hour maintenance agreements under which it 
</p>
<p>charges customers based only on the actual fl ying hours of the engines. 2  For more 
</p>
<p>examples of servicizing business models, we refer the reader to Rothenberg ( 2007 ), 
</p>
<p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( 2009 ), and Fischer et al. ( 2012 ). 
</p>
<p> Researchers have argued that servicizing business models can lead to higher 
</p>
<p>profi tability. In particular, they have proposed that by focusing on the fi nal customer 
</p>
<p>needs and delivering integrated solutions fulfi lling these needs, companies can 
</p>
<p>2   The term  performance-based contracting  is also used to describe agreements that are similar in 
spirit.

</p>
<p>improve their positions in the value chain, enhance the value of their offerings, and 
</p>
<p>improve their innovation potentials (Wise and Baumgartner  1999 ; Sawhney et al. 
</p>
<p> 2003 ). Such arguments are in line with our previous mention of the  economic ben-
</p>
<p>efi ts   of more service-oriented business practices. Besides the potential economic 
</p>
<p>benefi ts that more service-oriented business models may hold, recently researchers 
</p>
<p>and environmental groups have argued that servicizing business models may also be 
</p>
<p>associated with environmental benefi ts and, therefore, can be positioned to support 
</p>
<p>the objective of sustainable development (Rothenberg  2007 ). Throughout the rest of 
</p>
<p>this chapter, we explore some of the rationale for this claim. 
</p>
<p> In this section, we formally introduced the concept of servicizing and presented 
</p>
<p>some of its most successful implementations in practice. We concluded by mention-
</p>
<p>ing the support that servicizing has received as a potentially win-win (i.e., economi-
</p>
<p>cally and environmentally superior) business strategy. In the next section, we further 
</p>
<p>explore some of the arguments regarding the economic and environmental potential 
</p>
<p>of servicizing  business models  .   
</p>
<p>16.3      The Economic and Environmental Impact 
</p>
<p>of Servicizing Models 
</p>
<p> In this section, we provide details regarding the economic and environmental appeal 
</p>
<p>of servicizing models and, more specifi cally, their potential to support the three pil-
</p>
<p>lars of sustainability: people, profi t, and planet. 
</p>
<p>16.3.1     Servicizing: The &ldquo;Triple-Threat Business Model?&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> The decoupling of  customer   value from product ownership seems to be at the heart 
</p>
<p>of the arguments in support of the environmental potential of servicizing. The rea-
</p>
<p>son is that this decoupling can contribute to the dematerialization of the economy 
</p>
<p>(Heiskanen and Jalas  2000 ) by requiring less energy or material to generate the 
</p>
<p>same (or even more) customer value. This can sometimes be achieved simply 
</p>
<p>through using novel contractual mechanisms. For instance, in the context of chemi-
</p>
<p>cal management solutions, shared-savings contracts are sometimes used between 
</p>
<p>suppliers and buyers instead of the typical price-quantity contracts. Under such con-
</p>
<p>tracts, a supplier is not rewarded based on the material sold to the buyer, but, rather, 
</p>
<p>based on the savings that the buyer enjoys due to a reduction in the consumption of 
</p>
<p>such materials (Corbett and DeCroix  2001 ; Corbett et al.  2005 ). 
</p>
<p> For another context in which dematerialization may also occur, consider the 
</p>

</p>
<p>customers at different periods of time. This results in better fl eet utilization and 
</p>
<p>overall lower production volume, which directly benefi ts the environment by reduc-
</p>
<p>ing the production-related emissions and use of raw material. This is true under 
</p>
<p>several servicizing models, the providers of which do not need to dedicate one prod-
</p>
<p>uct to each customer. 
</p>
<p> The arguments for  the   environmental superiority of servicizing are also sup-
</p>
<p>ported by the fact that, in the majority of the business models, customers are charged 
</p>
<p>on a per-use basis (e.g., per-page-printed, per-mile-driven, etc.). Directly linking 
</p>
<p>payment to product usage may incentivize customers to reduce their use of the prod-
</p>
<p>uct, resulting in a lower environment burden. The decrease in usage due to pay-per- 
</p>
<p>use pricing is attributed to what is known as the taxi-meter effect (or fl at rate bias; 
</p>
<p>see Lambrecht and Skiera  2006 ), which postulates that customers enjoy their prod-
</p>
<p>uct usage more at a fl at rate and tend to use it less when they are charged for each 
</p>
<p>unit of usage. 
</p>
<p> Finally, in most of the servicizing business models, the manufacturer maintains 
</p>
<p>the ownership of the products. This may incentivize manufacturers to design and 
</p>
<p>produce products of higher reliability (Guajardo et al.  2012 ) or with longer useful 
</p>
<p>life, so as to maximize the revenue extracted from each product per unit of time. 
</p>
<p>This can also be achieved through better maintenance, which can typically be 
</p>
<p>accomplished more productively by the manufacturer than the customer. Such prac-
</p>
<p>tices also affect the end-of-life management of the products since a manufacturer is 
</p>
<p>more likely to choose a more environmentally friendly way to dispose of a product 
</p>
<p>than a customer and may even reduce the number of units that are disposed of in any 
</p>
<p>given period of time by prolonging the useful lifecycles through remanufacturing or 
</p>
<p>harvesting spare parts (see also Chap.   17     by Abbey and Guide ( 2017 )). 
</p>
<p> Do the above- mentioned   arguments imply that servicizing is the &ldquo;triple-threat 
</p>
<p>business model,&rdquo; that is, a business model that excels simultaneously in all three 
</p>
<p>pillars of sustainability: people, profi t, and planet? Recent research (Bellos et al. 
</p>
<p> 2016 ; Agrawal and Bellos  2015 ) shows that this may not always be the case. But 
</p>
<p>why not? Before we answer this question, we need to understand how the three pil-
</p>
<p>lars of sustainability relate to each other and how the performance of a business 
</p>
<p>model with respect to these dimensions is assessed.  
</p>
<p>16.3.2     Assessing Business Model Performance 
</p>
<p>Against the Triple Bottom Line 
</p>
<p> With respect to  the   profi t dimension, it is straightforward to argue that, for a given 
</p>
<p>(pay-per-use) price, profi t increases as the number of customers who use the fi rm&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>products increases and/or the amount of use that each customer extracts from the 
</p>
<p>product increases (i.e., as customers drive more or print more pages). 
</p>
<p> With respect to the people dimension, one way to estimate the impact of a new 
</p>
<p>business model is to measure the overall consumer surplus. Assuming that every

</p>
<p>customer derives a positive utility from using a product, for a given (pay-per-use) 
</p>
<p>price higher product usage increases an individual consumer&rsquo;s surplus. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>the overall consumer surplus increases as the number of customers who adopt and 
</p>
<p>use a product increases. 
</p>
<p> This brings us to the third dimension: that of environmental performance (i.e., 
</p>
<p>the planet). To assess the environmental performance of a business model, a life-
</p>
<p>cycle approach can be adopted (see Chap.   2     by Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 )) and the 
</p>
<p>environmental burden created at the phases of production, use, and disposal can be 
</p>
<p>calculated (Agrawal et al.  2012 ). The environmental burden during the production 
</p>
<p>and disposal phases depends on the total number of products manufactured and 
</p>
<p>disposed of during each time period, while during the use phase it depends on the 
</p>
<p>amount of the overall use that customers extract from the products (it may already 
</p>
<p>be apparent that what increases profi t or consumer surplus may also increase the 
</p>
<p>environmental burden). Each phase may also be characterized by a different per- 
</p>
<p>unit  environmental   impact. For instance, a certain type of product may cause a 
</p>
<p>higher environmental burden during the use phase as opposed to the production or 
</p>
<p>disposal phase.  
</p>
<p>16.3.3     Servicizing: Possible Environmental Issues 
</p>
<p> From an environmental point of view,  the   implementation of servicizing, as opposed 
</p>
<p>to a traditional sales-only business model, can backfi re from a few angles. As an 
</p>
<p>example, consider again the business model of car sharing. It is true that customers 
</p>
<p>may choose to relinquish car ownership and decide to cover their  transportation   
</p>
<p>needs by joining a car sharing program, something that would constitute an environ-
</p>
<p>mental win. However, at the same time, car sharing may make car usage more 
</p>
<p>attractive to customers who typically use more sustainable modes of transportation 
</p>
<p>(e.g., biking and/or public transportation). While the pooling effect may cause the 
</p>
<p>overall number of vehicles produced to decrease, a larger number of customers 
</p>
<p>adopting car sharing may imply that the overall level of vehicle usage increases (see 
</p>
<p>Bellos et al.  2016 ). Despite the fact that such an increase in usage may lead to a 
</p>
<p>higher profi t and higher  consumer surplus  , it can also be environmentally problem-
</p>
<p>atic because several studies (Sullivan and Cobas-Flores  2001 ; MacLean and Lave 
</p>
<p> 2003 ) have shown that the majority of the environmental impact of an automobile 
</p>
<p>occurs during the use phase of its lifecycle. This issue may not be unique to car shar-
</p>
<p>ing, as many other types of products are characterized by higher use rather than 
</p>
<p>production impact. 
</p>
<p> Even the pooling effect, which can be directly linked to the concept of  demateri-
</p>
<p>alization  , may also be responsible for some unintended environmental drawbacks. 
</p>
<p>The reason is that a smaller production volume due to pooling results in a smaller 
</p>
<p>overall production cost, which may allow the manufacturer to: (1) lower the prices 
</p>
<p>and/or (2) invest in improving the product effi ciency (the manufacturer may be par-
</p>
<p>ticularly interested in improving product effi ciency because, under most servicizing

</p>
<p>business models, the manufacturer is responsible for the operating cost of the prod-
</p>
<p>uct). Since lower prices and improved effi ciencies may further increase adoption 
</p>
<p>and overall product usage (and therefore profi tability), the well-known Jevons para-
</p>
<p>dox 3  may occur and result in higher environmental burden. 
</p>
<p> In this section, we provided a brief summary of the economic and environmental 
</p>
<p>implications associated with the implementation of a servicizing business model. 
</p>
<p>For an analysis of the environmental performance of servicizing, we refer the reader 
</p>
<p>to Agrawal and Bellos ( 2015 ). In what follows, we provide more details on how 
</p>
<p>fi rms may implement a servicizing strategy and some of the major challenges inher-
</p>
<p>ent in doing so.   
</p>
<p>16.4      Implementing a Servicizing Strategy 
</p>
<p> Having discussed some of the multiple  benefi ts   that a servicizing strategy can pro-
</p>
<p>vide, we now outline some of the possible implementation challenges that an orga-
</p>
<p>nization may face during the transformation of its business model from a 
</p>
<p>product-based one to a solutions-based one. In addition, we describe the close rela-
</p>
<p>tionship of an even newer class of business models, known as collaborative con-
</p>
<p>sumption models, to servicizing business models. Finally, we provide information 
</p>
<p>about a design technique that is widely used in practice and which can facilitate the 
</p>
<p>implementation of a servicizing strategy. 
</p>
<p>16.4.1     Possible Transition and Implementation Challenges 
</p>
<p>from Adopting Servicizing 
</p>
<p> From an economic point of view, the transition to services has not always been suc-
</p>
<p>cessful, as there have been several cases where increasing the  service   component of 
</p>
<p>a product-based organization decreased the overall fi rm performance (Gebauer 
</p>
<p>et al.  2005 ). Interestingly, recent research (Suarez et al.  2013 ) has identifi ed a non-
</p>
<p>linear effect between fi rm profi tability and the extent of the service involvement. 
</p>
<p>Specifi cally, services appear to have a positive effect on profi tability after they reach 
</p>
<p>a critical point of contribution to the fi rm&rsquo;s overall revenue. This may indicate a 
</p>
<p>strategy where fi rms initially provide their services at a low price in order to attract 
</p>
<p>customers into buying their products. As the number of customers reaches a critical 
</p>
<p>mass, the fi rms may tend to focus on service delivery and to streamline the relevant 
</p>
<p>processes, resulting in improved profi tability. 
</p>
<p>3   According to the Jevons paradox (also referred to as the rebound effect; Greening et al.  2000 ), the 
overall rate of consumption of a resource increases as the effi ciency of the resource improves. That 
is, as we make the usage of something cheaper, we tend to use more of it. 
</p>
<p>16 Moving from a Product-Based Economy to a Service-Based Economy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>364
</p>
<p> One may argue that the inability of some product organizations to reap  the   ben-
</p>
<p>efi ts of providing services relates to the hurdles they face trying to transition from a 
</p>
<p>product-based mentality to a service-based one. These hurdles can be attributed to 
</p>
<p>the inherent differences 4  between managing products and managing services. For 
</p>
<p>instance, in product-based environments, centralization, effi ciency, economies of 
</p>
<p>scale, and standardization share a common underpinning, that of eliminating vari-
</p>
<p>ability, which is almost always considered to be a necessary condition for successful 
</p>
<p>operational and fi nancial performance. Now compare this with  the   unique charac-
</p>
<p>teristics (Zeithaml et al.  1985 ) that services are known to hold: (1) intangibility (i.e., 
</p>
<p>lack of specifi cations), (2) heterogeneity in the customer requests and/or the service 
</p>
<p>outcome, (3) perishability (i.e., inability to inventory service performance/out-
</p>
<p>come), and (4) co-production (i.e., the need for both the provider and the customer 
</p>
<p>to be engaged to deliver the service outcome). If anything, these characteristics 
</p>
<p>imply an exposure to higher variability. Therefore, the tension between the two 
</p>
<p>worlds immediately becomes apparent. Moving from one mindset to another may 
</p>
<p>arguably require extensive organizational &ldquo;rewiring.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p> Certain  implementation   challenges, however, may be unique to (or at least more 
</p>
<p>pronounced under) a servicizing business model that attempts to decouple product 
</p>
<p>ownership from customer value. Such challenges may pertain to:
</p>
<p>&bull;    Internal resistance from employees, especially salespeople, who under a product 
</p>
<p>regime are typically compensated based on commissions tied to the quantity of 
</p>
<p>products or material sold. Under servicizing, the base of the transaction is the 
</p>
<p>solution that the product offers, not the product per se. For this reason, incentive 
</p>
<p>mechanisms will have to be redesigned so that they do not depend on the quan-
</p>
<p>tity of products sold. New incentives may be focused on customer retention, 
</p>
<p>increases in revenue, expansion of the customer base, etc. This can be a rocky 
</p>
<p>transition because the differences in the magnitude of the dollar amount per 
</p>
<p>transaction can be vast. For instance, 60&ndash;70 % of the maintenance cost of a jet 
</p>
<p>engine is attributed to the cost of materials. Replaceable parts include airfoils, 
</p>
<p>blades, and guide vanes. Replaceable parts include airfoils, blades, and guide 
</p>
<p>vanes. A turbine blade may cost as much as $8,000. Given that an engine may 
</p>
<p>comprise 60&ndash;80 blades, this can bring the value of a potential sale up to $700,000 
</p>
<p>for the maintenance of a single engine (information and numbers based on 
</p>
<p>Ackert  2011 ). Without proactively addressing the compensation schemes, a 
</p>
<p>company may realize a loss of talent during the early stages of the transition to 
</p>
<p>servicizing. Toffel ( 2008 ) provides a thorough discussion on the agency issues in 
</p>
<p>servicizing business models.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   The  complexity   of the new contractual agreements. This can be the case espe-
</p>
<p>cially when such agreements are based on (uncertain) product performance (e.g., 
</p>
<p>engine up-time). The cost of implementing such contracts may be more diffi cult 
</p>
<p>4   Some of these differences are probably hard-coded due to differences in the training of key stake-
holders. Such differences typically fortify silos within organizations. For instance, think of the 
eternal clash of the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; engineering/operations with the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; marketing side of the house.

<p>365
</p>
<p>to estimate since it depends on performance that is unrealized at the time of the 
</p>
<p>agreement. Because of this, manufacturers may be tempted to overpromise on key 
</p>
<p>performance metrics. However, failure to deliver on these promises may impose 
</p>
<p>steep penalties, either by fi nancially compensating the customer or by making last 
</p>
<p>minute arrangements (e.g., through third-party providers) to ensure that customer 
</p>
<p>needs are met. Of course, such problems may subside over time due to the manu-
</p>
<p>facturer obtaining better data about the performance of the products or the client&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>operating needs and conditions. The manufacturer may even use this feedback to 
</p>
<p>invest in products with higher reliability (Guajardo et al.  2012 ).    
</p>
<p> Changing the base of the transaction from the product to the service and solution 
</p>
<p>level can be challenging for the customers too. The reason is that such a change also 
</p>
<p>affects the basis of the cost-benefi t analysis. Assessing the benefi t requires a good 
</p>
<p>estimation of the product usage needs (e.g., how many pages we print per year and 
</p>
<p>what we gain from that), whereas assessing the cost requires the holistic estimation 
</p>
<p>of expenses related to functions such as purchasing, operation, maintenance, and 
</p>
<p>disposal, which for most organizations are decentralized (i.e., different parts of the 
</p>
<p>organization are responsible for each function). 
</p>
<p> For instance, consider the failed attempt of Interface to transition from selling 
</p>
<p>carpets to offering &ldquo;fl oorcovering services.&rdquo; Specifi cally, through what was known 
</p>
<p>as Evergreen &trade;  Services Agreement (EVA), instead of selling carpets, Interface 
</p>
<p>began offering long-term carpet leases that required the purchase of additional sup-
</p>
<p>port services such as maintenance and selective tiles replacement. However, several 
</p>
<p>years after launch and despite the strong support from top-management, the EVA&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>market acceptance remained weak. One of the main reasons was that customers 
</p>
<p>rarely understood how much they currently were spending on cleaning and main-
</p>
<p>taining their carpets since these expenses were often buried under more general 
</p>
<p>maintenance and cleaning budgets. For this reason, the EVA option often appeared 
</p>
<p>to be uneconomical compared with the  perce  ived status quo (Oliva and Quinn  2003 ; 
</p>
<p>for a more detailed discussion of the reasons EVA failed, see Toktay et al.  2006  and 
</p>
<p>Ferguson and Plambeck  2008 ).
</p>
<p>&bull;    Behavioral effects such as the endowment effect, which postulates that custom-
</p>
<p>ers tend to place more value on objects that they own than on those that they do 
</p>
<p>not (Thaler  1980 ; Kahneman et al.  1991 ) and, for that reason, may not fi nd ser-
</p>
<p>vicizing as appealing as direct ownership. Although there is already evidence 
</p>
<p>(The Economist  2012 ) that customers (especially of younger age) now exhibit a 
</p>
<p>more utilitarian attitude towards consumption that is not infl uenced as much by 
</p>
<p>behavioral effects, this is a cultural/generational change that may require time to 
</p>
<p>fully occur. Also, the lack of product ownership may induce availability or acces-
</p>
<p>sibility anxieties, similar to the range of anxieties observed among drivers of 
</p>
<p>electric vehicles (Avci et al.  2015 ; Lim et al.  2015 ).  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Faster deterioration due to heavier use or more frequent repairs of the products 
</p>
<p>due to customers&rsquo; careless use, or even abuse, of the equipment. For instance, 
</p>
<p>car-sharing customers may be less mindful of road hazards or may be less con-
</p>
<p>servative with their driving behavior when they are not fi nancially responsible 
</p>
<p>16 Moving from a Product-Based Economy to a Service-Based Economy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>366
</p>
<p>for the maintenance of the vehicle they use. Such behavior can also diminish 
</p>
<p>possible environmental benefi ts because it may either  decr  ease the effi ciency of 
</p>
<p>the products (i.e., products may require more energy to deliver the same amount 
</p>
<p>of use) and/or may require the provider to replace the products more often (i.e., 
</p>
<p>it may increase the number of products required per unit of time). As another 
</p>
<p>example, theft, damages, and vandalism are among the most challenging prob-
</p>
<p>lems that V&eacute;lib, the French bike-sharing provider, has been facing since it started 
</p>
<p>operating in Paris in 2007 (The New York Times  2009 ; France24  2013 ). Extra 
</p>
<p>security measures, monitoring mechanisms, product redesigns, and more fre-
</p>
<p>quent maintenance, however, can partially address such issues, albeit at an 
</p>
<p>increased cost.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Customer-induced negative externalities. Specifi cally, the fact that under serviciz-
</p>
<p>ing customers do not maintain product ownership implies a loss of control over 
</p>
<p>the product and that the value each customer derives, to a certain extent, depends 
</p>
<p>on decisions made and actions taken (even inadvertently) by other customers. For 
</p>
<p>instance, in a car sharing model, a late return of a vehicle can interfere with the 
</p>
<p>reservations of other customers. Similarly, failure of one customer to refuel or 
</p>
<p>maintain a vehicle&rsquo;s cleanliness can negatively affect the experience of the other 
</p>
<p>users. To counter such negative experiences, the provider may be required to 
</p>
<p>install monitoring mechanisms along with a penalty structure to dissuade such 
</p>
<p>behaviors. However, such &ldquo;instrumental controls&rdquo; (Frei  2005 ) may be perceived 
</p>
<p>as a license to break the rules (e.g., license to be late in the case of car sharing) 
</p>
<p>because it quantifi es the implications of doing so and, therefore, a customer can 
</p>
<p>engage in a cost-benefi t analysis, ignoring how their actions will affect other cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. According to Levitt and Dubner ( 2005 ), this was the case when some 
</p>
<p>daycare centers in Israel imposed penalties on parents who were late in picking-
</p>
<p>up their kids. After announcing the fees, the centers observed an increase in the 
</p>
<p>parents&rsquo; tardiness (the original experiment can be found in Gneezy and Rustichini 
</p>
<p> 2000 ). On the contrary, &ldquo;normative controls&rdquo; rely on subjective measures such as 
</p>
<p>shame, guilt, embarrassment, and a sense of community or sense of  dut  y. A pro-
</p>
<p>vider&rsquo;s task is thus to devise mechanisms that can deter unacceptable behavior by 
</p>
<p>eliciting such reactions and feelings. For instance, Zipcar always tries to create a 
</p>
<p>sense of community by referring to its members as &ldquo;Zipsters&rdquo; or by featuring 
</p>
<p>stories of its members and employees on its online magazine Ziptopia. For an 
</p>
<p>excellent discussion of instrumental vs. normative controls, see Frei ( 2005 ).     
</p>
<p>16.4.2     From an Economy Based on Products to Services 
</p>
<p>and Now, to Collaborative Consumption? 
</p>
<p> Recently, a new type of business model has been gaining traction by building on 
</p>
<p>what is known as  collaborative consumption  . The concept of collaborative con-
</p>
<p>sumption refers to the type of consumption that takes place through (peer-to-peer) 
</p>
<p>I. Bellos and M. Ferguson</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>367
</p>
<p>sharing, swapping, lending, or other similar activities (Botsman and Rogers  2011 ). 
</p>
<p>Such activities may or may not involve monetary exchange. For instance, other than 
</p>
<p>maybe some gestures of appreciation (e.g., cooking dinner), members of 
</p>
<p>Couchsurfi ng do not typically exchange money in return for the hospitality pro-
</p>
<p>vided. On the other hand, in the more well-known business models of Airbnb and 
</p>
<p>Uber, participating members (i.e., qualifi ed hosts and drivers) contribute their prop-
</p>
<p>erties by listing their apartments/houses and driving services, respectively, to the 
</p>
<p>greater pool in return for monetary compensation, which is typically based on the 
</p>
<p>amount of time the property was used by other customers. Similar to servicizing, 5  
</p>
<p>the importance of product ownership is diminished in the sense that no ownership 
</p>
<p>rights are transferred to each end-user and payment is linked to product usage. 
</p>
<p> Business models that rely on collaborative consumption may alleviate some of 
</p>
<p>the economic issues identifi ed earlier for the servicizing models by achieving a 
</p>
<p>middle ground. For instance, drivers of Uber can still maintain the pride of owner-
</p>
<p>ship of their vehicles and, at the same time, improve the utilization for a fair com-
</p>
<p>pensation. Essentially, such models achieve a more effi cient matching of supply 
</p>
<p>with demand by: (1) increasing both the availability and accessibility of capacity, 
</p>
<p>(2) encouraging effi cient allocation of the supply through centralized and dynamic 
</p>
<p>pricing, and (3) removing information asymmetries regarding the quality of the 
</p>
<p>product/service through online review systems. 
</p>
<p> From an  environmental   point of view, however, it is not clear whether such new 
</p>
<p>business models will have a positive impact. For instance, one may argue that Uber 
</p>
<p>may be actually contributing to a higher environmental burden because, to a certain 
</p>
<p>extent, it makes vehicle ownership more affordable by creating another source of 
</p>
<p>revenue through which drivers can cover car ownership-related expenses (i.e., gas, 
</p>
<p>maintenance, insurance, etc.). On the other hand, it can also be argued that it con-
</p>
<p>tributes to creating a more developed and interconnected network of transportation. 
</p>
<p>As an example, it may make it easier for a traveler to hire an Uber cab to head to a 
</p>
<p>Metro station and then use public transportation to travel to the fi nal destination 
</p>
<p>(e.g., the airport). Therefore, there may be segments of the market that fi nd it more 
</p>
<p>economical to cover their transportation needs through Uber (and public transporta-
</p>
<p>tion) and, for that reason, choose to relinquish car ownership, thus contributing to 
</p>
<p>the dematerialization of the economy. 
</p>
<p> Future research is  needed   to shed more light on the economic and environmental 
</p>
<p>implications of collaborative consumption models. One promising direction can be 
</p>
<p>the identifi cation of the profi le of customers (e.g., in terms of income or usage 
</p>
<p>needs, etc.) who would benefi t most from choosing to cover their needs through 
</p>
<p>such models.  
</p>
<p>5   It has been suggested that PSS can be thought of as a special category of collaborative consump-
tion business model (Botsman and Rogers  2011 ). However, we should point out that most collab-
orative consumption models are found in B2C contexts and are typically offered by third-party 
providers. In contrast, servicizing models are observed in both B2C and B2B settings and often are 
offered by manufacturers and/or third party providers.

</p>
<p>16.4.3     Design Tools That Can Facilitate Servicizing 
</p>
<p> Implementing a servicizing strategy to transform from  a   product organization to a 
</p>
<p>solutions organization will probably come along with an array of critical decisions. 
</p>
<p>For instance, the fi rm may need to determine: the pricing structure (e.g., how much 
</p>
<p>to charge and whether to include a fi xed fee in addition to a pay-per-use fee), the 
</p>
<p>capacity (e.g., in the context of car sharing, the size of the fl eet; see Bellos et al. 
</p>
<p> 2016 ), the effi ciency/reliability/durability of its products (see Guajardo et al.  2012  
</p>
<p>and Agrawal and Bellos  2015 ), or to what extent (if any at all) the &ldquo;business-as- 
</p>
<p>usual&rdquo; model of selling products should be abandoned (e.g., the fi rm may decide to 
</p>
<p>focus entirely on selling products, offering solutions, or offering both solutions and 
</p>
<p>selling products; see Agrawal and Bellos  2015 ). 
</p>
<p> However, before a fi rm starts tackling such issues, certain aspects of which it 
</p>
<p>may have addressed in its existing business model (e.g., pricing issues are not 
</p>
<p>unique to servicizing business models), it is important to identify the key differen-
</p>
<p>tiator between the practice of selling products and the practice of selling solutions. 
</p>
<p>To do so, it could attempt to answer the question of whether moving from the prod-
</p>
<p>uct business to the solutions business requires a materially different perspective. 
</p>
<p>Namely, does the fi rm need to use different lenses to look at its offerings, or does it 
</p>
<p>suffi ce to focus on the aforementioned  operational and marketing issues   (e.g., deter-
</p>
<p>mining the capacity and the pricing, respectively)? 
</p>
<p> To answer these questions requires going through the task of rephrasing and 
</p>
<p>reframing everything in terms of solutions. This can be a revealing exercise. For 
</p>
<p>instance, thinking in terms of selling mobility solutions (as opposed to selling cars) 
</p>
<p>may uncover that the order winners no longer have to do with certain product speci-
</p>
<p>fi cations (e.g., time to increase speed from 0 to 60 mph) and features (e.g., whether 
</p>
<p>a specifi c car model comes with dual climate control and electronically adjustable 
</p>
<p>seats). This fi rst step can eliminate the product-related tunnel vision and enable the 
</p>
<p>fi rm to start thinking along the lines of how to best assist their customers in meeting 
</p>
<p>their basic needs. 
</p>
<p> This implies a holistic perspective that extends before and after the transaction 
</p>
<p>point (i.e., the point where payment occurs) between a customer and a fi rm. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the satisfaction that customers derive from meeting their mobility needs 
</p>
<p>through a car sharing program is also determined by the ease with which they navi-
</p>
<p>gate through the website to fi nd available vehicles and make reservations, make 
</p>
<p>changes in their reservations, fi nd the designated parking lot and the reserved car, 
</p>
<p>address unforeseen situations (e.g., having a fl at tire), and fi nally, make payments 
</p>
<p>and manage their accounts. The challenge in this case for the fi rm is to identify the 
</p>
<p>different elements that shape the overall customer experience. 
</p>
<p> Towards this end, design thinking can be of great value. Design thinking (Brown 
</p>
<p> 2008 ) refers to a human-centered design approach that relies on direct observation 
</p>
<p>and rapid prototyping (indeed, services can be prototyped; see Thomke  2003 ) to 
</p>
<p>create solutions that holistically address customer needs. It goes beyond traditional 
</p>
<p>marketing techniques (e.g., focus groups) because it allows customers to be in their 
</p>
<p>natural environment where they may use a product or receive a service. This is typi-
</p>
<p>I. Bellos and M. Ferguson</p>
<p/>

<p>369
</p>
<p>cally achieved through  empathic techniques   (Leonard and Rayport  1997 ) such as 
</p>
<p>shadowing, which allow researchers to have a customer-centric view of the fi rm&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>offering. One of the most insightful and practical outcomes of these techniques is 
</p>
<p>the creation of the customer journey 6  map. The customer journey map delineates the 
</p>
<p>series of different steps/stages that customers go through every time they satisfy a 
</p>
<p>need (e.g., mobility need). These different stages are known as touch-points (or 
</p>
<p>moments of truth; see Bitner et al.  2008 ) because they indicate points/moments at 
</p>
<p>which customers possibly interact with some aspect of the fi rm&rsquo;s offering (e.g., 
</p>
<p>interact with the online reservation system) and derive an experience. 
</p>
<p> The value of the  customer journey   rests on the fact that it enables the fi rm to 
</p>
<p>identify all the different elements that positively contribute to the customer experi-
</p>
<p>ence along with the points of failure in which the fi rm needs to improve on. 
</p>
<p>Essentially, it delineates the process through which customers interact with the 
</p>
<p>fi rms. This process-based view is indicative of the role that the operations manage-
</p>
<p>ment discipline can play in the development of such methods. In addition to the 
</p>
<p>process, the people (i.e., user) dimension is in support of the expansion of the cele-
</p>
<p>brated &ldquo;4P&rsquo;s&rdquo; of the marketing mix to &ldquo;6P&rsquo;s&rdquo; that defi ne the service mix (Teboul 
</p>
<p> 2006 ). The  customer journey   represents a method that is conducive to collabora-
</p>
<p>tions among disciplines that can break the silos we mentioned before. IDEO, the 
</p>
<p>innovation and design consulting fi rm, has pioneered its use as a design method in 
</p>
<p>the domain of both products and services (Bhavnani and Sosa  2006 ) through the use 
</p>
<p>of diverse and interdisciplinary teams. For an analytical treatment and discussion on 
</p>
<p>the use of the customer journey as a service design framework, we refer the reader 
</p>
<p>to Bellos and Kavadias ( 2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Admittedly, we have presented two sides of the same coin. On one side, the tran-
</p>
<p>sition to servicizing can be a challenging one as there are many diffi culties that an 
</p>
<p>organization may have to tackle. On the other (brighter) side, there are multiple 
</p>
<p>benefi ts such as a growing demand for innovative business models that depart from 
</p>
<p>conventional product/ownership-based models and the existence of established 
</p>
<p>design methods that can be used to make the implementation of servicizing models 
</p>
<p>easier. In the next section, we conclude this chapter by offering some thoughts on 
</p>
<p>what remains to be done.   
</p>
<p>16.5      Conclusion 
</p>
<p> The increasing number of manufacturing companies that transition to more service- 
</p>
<p>and solution-oriented business models indicates that Theodore Levitt&rsquo;s quote that 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>6   The concept of the customer journey relates to the service blueprints fi rst mentioned in the semi-
nal work of Shostack ( 1987 ). For a more recent discussion on the application of service blueprint 
see Bitner et al. ( 2008 ). Stickdorn and Schneider ( 2010 ) describe additional design thinking meth-
ods applied on services.

<p>16 Moving from a Product-Based Economy to a Service-Based Economy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>370
</p>
<p>(Christensen et al.  2006 ) is more true and relevant than ever. Done correctly, this 
</p>
<p>transition will be associated with environmental as well as economic benefi ts. In 
</p>
<p>this chapter, we explored some potential advantages and disadvantages, from both 
</p>
<p>the economic and environmental perspectives, associated with this transition. 
</p>
<p>Identifying these advantages and disadvantages is an important step closer to a 
</p>
<p>service- based economy. However, there is more work that needs to be done both 
</p>
<p>from  researchers and practitioners   to help overcome the hurdles that fi rms may face 
</p>
<p>when making this transition. For instance,
</p>
<p>&bull;    From an academic/research point of view: existing assessment methodologies 
</p>
<p>such as Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) may have to be further developed and applied 
</p>
<p>in servicizing settings to account for usage patterns, which may differ signifi -
</p>
<p>cantly compared with when customers own the product. Along these lines, it is 
</p>
<p>not clear whether offering certain types of products through servicizing may 
</p>
<p>result in more frequent replacement (due to increased wear and tear) and overall 
</p>
<p>larger production quantity than other types of products. Furthermore, more light 
</p>
<p>needs to be shed on the major drivers that determine customers&rsquo; decisions to 
</p>
<p>forego product ownership. When is the lack of ownership more acceptable to 
</p>
<p>customers, and what kind of technologies need to be developed to alleviate &ldquo;anx-
</p>
<p>ieties&rdquo; about product unavailability (i.e., the concern about not having access to 
</p>
<p>a product when needed)? Can offering an increased variety of products (e.g., 
</p>
<p>under a car sharing program this would imply offering an increased variety of 
</p>
<p>brands and trims) make servicizing models more appealing as customers get to 
</p>
<p>experience a broader range of products?  
</p>
<p>&bull;   From a managerial point of view: perhaps the greatest challenge is a cultural one. 
</p>
<p>Manufacturers need to realize that they are in the solutions business and act on 
</p>
<p>this realization. Ford has already started its transition to a &ldquo;mobility company&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>(Fortune  2015 ) and hopefully more manufacturers will be encouraged to follow 
</p>
<p>this example. Of course, such a transition cannot and should not happen over-
</p>
<p>night. As highlighted by several successful cases (Ford  2015 ; Peugeot  2015 ), con-
</p>
<p>stant experimentation through small-scale pilot programs is likely the safest 
</p>
<p>approach that manufacturers can use to gain momentum and make the transition.    
</p>
<p> Overall, we hope that our discussion in this chapter will motivate further interest 
</p>
<p>in the exciting topic of servicizing as an alternative  business   model for product- 
</p>
<p>centric fi rms.

<p>      Managers who consider a closed-loop supply chain just another environmental 
</p>
<p> initiative need to update their thinking. Modern fi rms that use closed-loop supply 
</p>
<p>chains as a competitive strategy receive many benefi ts&mdash;particularly higher profi ta-
</p>
<p>bility and control over a product&rsquo;s entire lifecycle. In fact, the market for multiple 
</p>
<p>lifecycle products continues to grow, with current estimates holding that remanufac-
</p>
<p>tured product sales exceed $100 billion per year. 1  As a result of analyzing the ever- 
</p>
<p>growing remanufacturing sector through years of working with managers in 
</p>
<p>numerous industries, various levers and themes surrounding effective closed-loop 
</p>
<p>supply chain strategies became apparent. This chapter presents these fi ndings and 
</p>
<p>shows how fi rms in multiple industries experienced both successes and failures of 
</p>
<p>their closed-loop supply chain strategies.

<p>17.1     Understanding a Closed-Loop Supply Chain 
</p>
<p> Over the past few decades, environmental initiatives moved from tertiary goals to 
</p>
<p>integral parts of corporate strategy. The  environmental transformation   manifested 
</p>
<p>for multiple reasons, ranging from corporate social responsibility initiatives (see 
</p>
<p>also Chap.   20     by Lee and Rammohan, in this volume) to increasing levels of legisla-
</p>
<p>tive mandates (see also Chap.   10     by Huang and Atasu, in this volume). 2  Whatever 
</p>
<p>the reason for the shift toward environmental initiatives, the outcome is clear: man-
</p>
<p>agers need innovative ways to reduce environmental impact while simultaneously 
</p>
<p>improving profi tability. Though common wisdom holds that environmental con-
</p>
<p>straints will inevitably reduce profi ts, numerous counterpoints exist as manifested 
</p>
<p>in fi rms that successfully implemented closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) strategies. 3  
</p>
<p>This chapter provides a current look at the ever-evolving body of CLSC knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Through looking at the body of knowledge, the chapter provides strategies to help 
</p>
<p>managers understand the challenges and opportunities of CLSCs in various types of 
</p>
<p>industries under differing strategic forces.  
</p>
<p>2   Corporate social responsibility  continues to generate much debate about the role of a corporation 
as a good citizen. For an excellent discussion of such issues, see Carroll, A. B. 1999. Corporate 
social responsibility evolution of a defi nitional construct. Business &amp; Society 38(3): 268&ndash;295. 
</p>
<p> Additionally, for fi rms less interested in internally promoting environmental initiatives, legisla-
tive mandates regarding environmental performance and impact are particularly prevalent in the 
European Union with the waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE :  http://ec.europa.eu/
environment/waste/weee/legis_en.htm ) and reduction of hazardous substances (RoHS:  http://
ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs_eee/index_en.htm ). Both laws seek to control environmen-
tal impact. Though the E.U. was among the fi rst to enact such laws, Japan ( http://www.env.go.jp/
en/policy/ ) and Australia ( http://www.environment.gov.au/about-us/legislation ) have followed 
with similar legislation aimed at curbing environmental impact. 
</p>
<p> Though much of the strict recycling mandates legislation has not occurred within the US, mul-
tinational fi rms already maintain product portfolios that meet the ambitious requirements. Should 
the legislative programs continue to expand throughout the world, fi rms holding such product 
portfolios may hold a competitive advantage over competitors who currently do not meet the 
requirements of such legislation. Various recent works address the issue of environmental legisla-
tion and product take-back. For two such works, see Atasu, A. and L.N. Van Wassenhove. 2010. 
&ldquo;Environmental Legislation Regarding Product Take-Back and Recovery&rdquo; in &lsquo;Closed‐Loop 
Supply Chains,&rsquo; Eds. M. Ferguson, G. Souza. Taylor and Francis. and a work tailored to the 
extended producer responsibility for electronics waste Atasu, A., R. Subramanian. 2012. Extended 
Producer Responsibility for E‐Waste: Individual or Collective Responsibility?  Production and 
Operations Management  21(6): 1042&ndash;1059. 
3   If the concept of a closed-loop supply chain is unfamiliar, multiple resources can provide guid-
ance and insights. For example, see Guide, V.D.R. Jr., and Van Wassenhove, L.N. 2003. &ldquo;Business 
Aspects of Closed-Loop Supply Chains&rdquo; in Guide, V.D.R. Jr., and Van Wassenhove, L.N. (eds.), 
Business Aspects of Closed-Loop Supply Chains Exploring the Issues. Pittsburgh: Carnegie 
Mellon University Press. Also, see Ferguson, M.E. and Souza, G.C. 2010. &ldquo;Closed-Loop Supply 
Chains New Developments to Improve the Sustainability of Business Practices. Boca Raton:

</p>
<p>17.2     The Core of a Closed-Loop Supply Chain 
</p>
<p> At the core, a closed-loop supply chain represents a series of processes and fl ows 
</p>
<p>aimed at some form of reuse or reclamation of  products and materials  . Specifi cally, 
</p>
<p>a closed-loop supply chain incorporates design, control, and operation of a system 
</p>
<p>to maximize value creation over the entire lifecycle of a product with dynamic 
</p>
<p>recovery of value from different types and volumes of returns over time. 4  As the 
</p>
<p>defi nition states, a CLSC must be dynamic and evolve over time to handle changing 
</p>
<p>market conditions. Such  evolution   makes managing a closed-loop supply chain an 
</p>
<p>ever-evolving set of processes, which can take on many different forms depending 
</p>
<p>on the product and industry in which a fi rm operates. Though a CLSC requires deci-
</p>
<p>sions at every macro decision level&mdash;operation, tactical, and strategic&mdash;this chapter 
</p>
<p>focuses heavily on the broad strategic issues facing a manager considering a 
</p>
<p>CLSC. As will become clear, the decision to operate a CLSC should be based on 
</p>
<p>seeking increased profi t&mdash;not just reducing costs&mdash;and improving corporate social 
</p>
<p>responsibility through improved environmental performance. 
</p>
<p> Of course, before a CLSC can start a second lifecycle for a product, a fi rst life-
</p>
<p>cycle must occur followed by the accompanying return of the product into a reuse 
</p>
<p>market. On one extreme, the return of the product into a reuse market can be in the 
</p>
<p>form of an end-of-use product that received considerable use by a prior owner, 
</p>
<p>which is typical in the business-to-business markets for large industrial equipment 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Caterpillar earth moving equipment and Xerox high-speed imaging equip-
</p>
<p>ment). On the other extreme, unlike the end-of-use returns that have often experi-
</p>
<p>enced extensive use, consumer product returns are often convenience returns&mdash;returns 
</p>
<p>due to the customer simply deciding that the product does not suit their needs. 5  
</p>
<p>These  convenience returns  , also called false failures, usually require minimal pro-
</p>
<p>cessing before returning to the market. Staggeringly, consumer product returns in 
</p>
<p>the United States now exceed $260 billion in 2013 alone. 6  In either extreme case, a 
</p>
<p>CLSC using remanufacturing provides a direct form of reuse that converts returned 
</p>
<p>products into like new condition for resale. Remanufacturing entails disassembling 
</p>
<p>the returned product, replacing any worn or broken components, repairing any 
</p>
<p>remaining defects, and repackaging the product for sale as a remanufactured item. 7  
</p>
<p>4   For a recent discussion of the continuing challenges in closed-loop supply chains, see Guide, 
V. D. R. and L.N. Van Wassenhove. 2009. The evolution of closed-loop supply chain research. 
Operations Research 57(1): 10&ndash;18. 
5   The rate of false failure returns can vary widely by the nature of the product and industry. As a 
prime example in the consumer electronics industry, Hewlett-Packard experienced false failure 
returns rates as high as 80 % of all inkjet printer returns. On the other hand, Bosch false failure 
return rates at a vastly lower 2 % of all power drill returns. For more information, see Ferguson, 
M., V.D.R. Guide, Jr., G.C. Souza. 2006. Supply chain coordination for false failure returns.

<p>17.2.1     Overview of Closed-Loop Supply Chain Activities 
</p>
<p> Before moving into a detailed discussion of the process fl ows of a CLSC, a high 
</p>
<p>level view at the three major CLSC activities provides context for readers who are 
</p>
<p>not yet familiar with the nature of closed-loop supply chain. Figure  17.1   provides   a 
</p>
<p>high level view of the front-end, engine, and back-end of a closed-loop supply chain.
</p>
<p>   The front-end activities entail collecting returned products through product 
</p>
<p>acquisition management. As noted previously, some products will be heavily used, 
</p>
<p>while others may have seen minimal if any use. Such diversity in the nature of 
</p>
<p>returns makes product acquisition management a critical activity for any manager 
</p>
<p>considering a CLSC strategy. If acquisition of returned product cores is relatively 
</p>
<p>simple, engaging in CLSC operations can be a fairly straightforward endeavor. 
</p>
<p>Conversely, if acquiring returned product cores is diffi cult or widely dispersed, even 
</p>
<p>the fi rst step of collecting returned products can prove to be a challenge. After returns 
</p>
<p>are collected, the engine activities allow remanufacturing of the returned product to 
</p>
<p>a like new condition. 8  Though this chapter does not delve into the  operational details, 
</p>
<p>the topic of the engineering feasibility and technical constraints in a CLSC has

facturing, see Guide, V.D.R., Jr. 2000. Production planning and control for remanufacturing:

front-end processes of product acquisition management, see Ferguson, M., V.D.R. Guide, Jr.,

</p>
<p>received much attention over the past decades (see Footnote 3). After the product has 
</p>
<p>been brought back to a marketable condition, the back-end activities entail putting 
</p>
<p>the product back into the market for another lifecycle. Until recently, the nature of 
</p>
<p>the market for reused products has received little attention. Fortunately, recent 
</p>
<p>research has started to defi ne the similarities and contrasts with the typical new  prod-
</p>
<p>uct   market. 9  As will be discussed at length later in this chapter, the three major CLSC 
</p>
<p>activities all work in unison and can be done in-house or as outsourced operations.  
</p>
<p>17.2.2     Examining Closed-Loop Supply Chain Flows 
</p>
<p> The primary function of a CLSC is to employ some form of reuse at the product, 
</p>
<p>component, or materials level. Each of these choices comes with differing degrees 
</p>
<p>of constraints, both in terms of recovery strategy and remarketing of the multiple 
</p>
<p>lifecycle product. Understanding how these constraints vary by the nature of the 
</p>
<p>industry is critical for managers investigating means to implement or improve their 
</p>
<p>fi rm&rsquo;s CLSC strategy. Figure  17.2  displays  various   fl ows at the product, component, 
</p>
<p>and materials levels. 10  (Chap.   5     by Blass et al., in this volume provides more detail 
</p>
<p>on  analyzing and managing material fl ows.) Each of these fl ows offers fi rms differ-
</p>

pricing structures, and market segments, see, Abbey, J.D., M.G. Meloy, V.D.R. Guide, Jr., and

</p>
<p>ent opportunities for recovery and reuse strategies, which are directly infl uenced by 
</p>
<p>the original product design. In particular, materials reprocessing would typically 
</p>
<p>fall in the realm of recycling. For example, recycled plastics may be used as either 
</p>
<p>like-to- like (e.g., water bottles) or down-cycling (e.g., tires to rubber mulch) materi-
</p>
<p>als. The component and product reprocessing, typically called refurbishing or 
</p>
<p>remanufacturing, generally require far less energy intensity than materials recy-
</p>
<p>cling. As such, product and component reuse are generally preferable over the more 
</p>
<p>energy- intensive recycling, which is the least preferred of the options from an envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental standpoint. 11 
</p>
<p>   As shown in Fig.  17.2 , some form of a waste stream is inevitable. Simply put, 
</p>
<p>some products, components, and materials have a limited number of lifecycles or 
</p>
<p>only a single use. The goal of a manager trying to implement environmental initia-
</p>
<p>tives through a CLSC is to convert what was previously a stream of waste into 
</p>
<p>profi table reuse. Though this sounds like an ideal win&ndash;win scenario&mdash;environmen-
</p>
<p>tal benefi ts and higher profi ts&mdash;many pitfalls prevent fi rms from committing to a 
</p>
<p>CLSC strategy. In the consumer products arena, one of the highest hurdles is the 
</p>
<p>challenge of cannibalization of new product sales with the sale of lower-priced 
</p>
<p>remanufactured offerings. As discussed just a few years ago, managers should han-
</p>
<p>dle this challenge from a total profi tability, portfolio perspective. 12  For most fi rms 
</p>
<p>considering a CLSC, the problem of reacquiring previously sold products, product 
</p>
<p>acquisition management (PrAM), can be daunting as the reverse supply chain fl ows 
</p>
<p>may not be a current competence. 13  In particular, for fi rms in the technology sector 
</p>
<p>that face a high marginal value of time&mdash;a rapid decline in a product&rsquo;s value during 
</p>
<p>a lifecycle&mdash;acquiring, testing, inspecting, and returning the product to market 
</p>
<p>quickly are imperative. On the fl ip side, for fi rms facing lesser marginal value of 
</p>
<p>time pressures&mdash;minimal decline in the product&rsquo;s value during a lifecycle&mdash;the 
</p>
<p>acquisition and resulting remanufacturing activities are not as time-sensitive or 
</p>
<p>asset-intensive. 14  
</p>
<p> Other related research has shown that there is no one-size-fi ts- all   strategy for a 
</p>
<p>closed-loop supply chain. For some fi rms, such as the Xerox Corporation, product

</p>
<p>acquisition is quite simple as customers often lease large printing equipment, but life-
</p>
<p>cycle management and design issues represent major challenges. 15  Conversely, many 
</p>
<p>consumer product fi rms have had great diffi culty managing the core acquisition pro-
</p>
<p>cess and reverse supply chain as the consumer products typically have a short, single 
</p>
<p>lifecycle. 16  To shed light on the differences in strategy by the nature of the industry, 
</p>
<p>this chapter delves into two major dimensions that help a fi rm match their CLSC 
</p>
<p>strategy with the nature of their market&mdash;product design and core competencies.   
</p>
<p>17.3     A Framework for Matching Product Design and Core 
</p>
<p>Competencies 
</p>
<p> Product design is  a   highly complex topic in its own right. Thus, adding yet another 
</p>
<p>layer of complexity in the form of designing for more than one lifecycle may seem 
</p>
<p>daunting. Fortunately, designing for multiple lifecycles tends to have many positive 
</p>
<p>effects, such as reduced return rates, easier reparability, and faster turnaround for 
</p>
<p>warranty claims and returns. 17  Of course, when market pressures are high to get an 
</p>
<p>innovative product to the market, speed and effi ciency of production often take pre-
</p>
<p>dominant roles as is often the case in the consumer technology industry. Due to such 
</p>
<p>market-based pressures, many fi rms have naturally evolved core competencies 
</p>
<p>based on the nature of their industries&rsquo; competitive layout. However, as a product 
</p>
<p>line matures and technological innovation slows, the move toward CLSC operations 
</p>
<p>15   The  Xerox Corporation  has been a world leader in remanufacturing systems at their Webster, 
New York manufacturing/remanufacturing hybrid facilities. In both popular press and academic 
research, Xerox stands out as an exemplar of environmentally friendly closed-loop supply chain 
systems. Xerox works diligently from the design phase forward to recycle and remanufacture their 
equipment with great success in energy, materials, and waste reduction. For instance, in 2011, 
Xerox&rsquo;s remanufacturing operations diverted over 13 million pounds of waste from landfi lls. See 
a recent corporate sustainability report at  http://www.xerox.com/corporate-citizenship/2012/sus-
tainability/product-design/enus.html . 
16   Reverse supply chain design for consumer products remains a persistent issue for many fi rms. For 
a detailed discussion of viable solutions in consumer product industries, see the  California 
Management Review  article, Blackburn, J.D., V.D.R. Guide, G.C. Souza, and L.N. Van Wassenhove. 
2004. Reverse Supply Chains for Commercial Returns.  California Management Review  46: 6&ndash;22. 
17   Much recent research focuses on the need for better understanding of design for remanufacturing and 
reuse. Many resources exist for those interested in the engineering side of design such as the Rochester 
Institute of Technology&rsquo;s Center for Remanufacturing ( http://www.rit.edu/gis/remanufacturing/ ). For 
an excellent summary of recent research on the topic of product design in a CLSC, see Bras, B. 2010.

<p>as a core competency may offer increased profi t opportunities. Figure  17.3   shows 
</p>
<p>  how design and core competencies interact with four resulting strategies. 18 
</p>
<p>   Breaking down each quadrant in the manager&rsquo;s matrix of Fig.  17.3  provides 
</p>
<p>insights into the infl uence that product design has on product acquisition manage-
</p>
<p>ment, reverse logistics, reuse processes, and the nature of the reused product mar-
</p>
<p>ket. First, as shown in Fig.  17.3 , product design plays a key role in dictating 
</p>
<p>recoverable value, particularly at the product and component levels. Even at the 
</p>
<p>materials level, product design plays a signifi cant role. For example, recovering 
</p>
<p>heavy metals from smartphones and many other small electronic devices is no easy 
</p>
<p>task as the devices are integral by design. 19  Second, reverse logistics both entails 
</p>
<p>product acquisition management&mdash;the means to reacquire end-of-use returned 
</p>
<p>products&mdash;and requires either ownership or outsourcing the transportation network 
</p>
<p>for moving the end-of-use products. Third, the core operational reuse processes, 
</p>
<p>18   The major impetus for this chapter and framework for understanding strategies for reuse through 
remanufacturing comes from ongoing research found in the manuscript, Abbey, J.D. and

</p>
<p>such as the choice of the recovery level (i.e., product, component, or materials), 
</p>
<p>require decisions regarding investment in remanufacturing capabilities in both capi-
</p>
<p>tal equipment and people. Finally, the fourth lever describes the means of remarket-
</p>
<p>ing products going through more than one lifecycle. If a market for such products 
</p>
<p>does exist, then deciding whether to lease or sell the products has major implica-
</p>
<p>tions on the CLSC strategy. As will become clear throughout this chapter, a decision 
</p>
<p>in any one of the levers can have signifi cant impacts on all other decisions. Figure 
</p>
<p> 17.4  summarizes the four key levers that either derive from or  drive   a closed-loop 
</p>
<p>supply chain strategy (see Footnote 18).
</p>
<p>17.3.1       Quadrant I: Quality, Durability, and Maintainability 
</p>
<p> In this quadrant of Fig.  17.3 , the  original      manufacturer of the assets tends to focus 
</p>
<p>on selling with limited post-sale support. As a prime example, consider the airline 
</p>
<p>industry. In many cases, airlines prefer to buy the multi-billion dollar fl eets of air-
</p>
<p>planes from the aircraft manufacturers. As such, the aircraft manufacturers accom-
</p>
<p>modate by going through intensive new product design processes focused on quality, 
</p>
<p>reliability, and maintainability in the fi eld. These traits actually mesh with the mul-
</p>
<p>tiple lifecycle design traits of other industries that do maintain asset control (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Xerox) and lend themselves well to product reuse in a CLSC. However, the loss of 
</p>
<p>asset control post-sale has signifi cant downsides. The most obvious downside is that 
</p>
<p>reacquiring a used product may be diffi cult if not infeasible. The airplane manufac-
</p>
<p>turers simply have no interest in reacquiring the assets after a sale occurs. Such lack 
</p>
<p>of asset control opened up an entire third-party industry centered on overhauling 
</p>
<p>and remanufacturing products ranging from full airliners to engines to small

</p>
<p>components of airplanes. 20  In other words, the airplane manufacturers have ceded 
</p>
<p>profi ts to third-party remanufacturers due to their robust designs combined with a 
</p>
<p>lack of access to the assets after the initial sale. 
</p>
<p> Another downside is that investing in  a      reverse logistics network for compo-
</p>
<p>nents/parts is often prohibitive when third-party entrants, such as Delta and 
</p>
<p>Lufthansa, already have a strong presence in the market. Additionally, the airplane 
</p>
<p>manufacturers (e.g., Boeing and Airbus) generally lack both tacit and explicit 
</p>
<p>knowledge of the testing, inspecting, and disposition processes as well as the appro-
</p>
<p>priate asset base for intensive remanufacturing of the assets. Finally, without a 
</p>
<p>strong market presence as a remanufacturing original equipment manufacturer, the 
</p>
<p>airplane manufacturers lack the market cache from which to capitalize. Overall, in 
</p>
<p>this quadrant, fi rms maintain minimal control over product reacquisition, reverse 
</p>
<p>logistics, and little to no market presence in the multiple  lifecycle      product market. 
</p>
<p>However, the fi rms do not need to invest heavily in capital-intensive remanufactur-
</p>
<p>ing systems.  
</p>
<p>17.3.2     Quadrant II: Multiple Lifecycle 
</p>
<p> In this quadrant,  the   original equipment manufacturer focuses on designing the prod-
</p>
<p>uct for multiple lifecycles from the inception of a product&rsquo;s design. The intention for 
</p>
<p>such products is to extract as many lifecycles as possible to maximize total lifecycle 
</p>
<p>profi ts. Such designs require strong vertical integration of both the initial sales and 
</p>
<p>end-of-use product reacquisition channels. If such integration of the initial sale and 
</p>
<p>reacquisition are not present, then third-party remanufacturers will gladly enter the 
</p>
<p>market to extract the additional lifecycle value missed by the original equipment 
</p>
<p>manufacturer as seen in the airline industry. Firms playing in this vertically inte-
</p>
<p>grated multiple lifecycle design quadrant also need to invest heavily in the reverse 
</p>
<p>logistics systems to maintain appropriate transportation to the asset- intensive reman-
</p>
<p>ufacturing facilities. At the remanufacturing facilities, the product design naturally 
</p>
<p>leads to rapid testing, inspecting, and disposition of the products for reentry into the 
</p>
<p>market. As exemplifi ed by the Xerox Corporation, markets for such multiple lifecy-
</p>
<p>cle products are highly segmented based on the dimensions of product performance 
</p>
<p>and price. The Xerox sales force actively markets the right package of &ldquo;newly manu-
</p>
<p>factured&rdquo; (i.e., blended new and remanufactured products) and completely new prod-
</p>
<p>ucts to suit any customer type. In fact, at the time of end-of-use for a product at a 
</p>
<p>20   Delta Airlines and Lufthansa continue to generate signifi cant cost savings and profi ts through 
repair and refurbishment of both their own equipment and equipment for other airlines. For details 
on Delta Airlines&rsquo; continued strategy of extending lifecycles of aircraft, see Carry, Susan. 2012. 
&ldquo;Delta Flies New Route to Profi ts: Older Jets,&rdquo; The Wall Street Journal November 16, 2012.

levels of maintenance, overhaul, engines, components, aircraft systems, and more. For details, see

<p>customer site, Xerox uses their sales expertise to provide higher performing, remanu-
</p>
<p>factured machines as a means to maintain a strong competitive foothold against their 
</p>
<p>non-remanufacturing competitors who cannot compete at the same price-perfor-
</p>
<p>mance thresholds. In sum, this quadrant represents the pinnacle in maximizing both 
</p>
<p>environmental benefi ts and profi tability through tight control over asset reacquisi-
</p>
<p>tion, reverse logistics networks, heavy investment in remanufacturing capabilities, 
</p>
<p>   and a deep understanding of market segments for the multiple lifecycle products.  
</p>
<p>17.3.3     Quadrant III: Single Lifecycle 
</p>
<p> The astute  reader   might have noticed that the prior two quadrants largely focus on 
</p>
<p>high value, business-to-business products. Though some fi rms still design such 
</p>
<p>high-value equipment for a single lifecycle, the most common examples of such 
</p>
<p>single lifecycle products come from the consumer products industries. Consumer 
</p>
<p>tastes and preferences often change rapidly, particularly in fast moving product seg-
</p>
<p>ments such as consumer electronics. Such fast moving industries can make extract-
</p>
<p>ing value from returned products extraordinarily diffi cult (see Footnote 14). In 
</p>
<p>response, many fi rms have abandoned the idea of designing products for anything 
</p>
<p>beyond a single lifecycle. Instead, such fi rms focus on extracting maximum profi t 
</p>
<p>through effi cient design and manufacturing systems with an accompanying focus on 
</p>
<p>preventing returns. Such a strategy has been successful for many companies with 
</p>
<p>the side effect of a massive resulting waste stream. Such a copious waste stream 
</p>
<p>represents a continuing force for increasing legislative mandates to prevent elec-
</p>
<p>tronics waste even in the United States. 21  In effect, though companies found the 
</p>
<p>strategy sustainable for making profi ts and meeting consumer needs, legislative 
</p>
<p>forces view the strategy as unsustainable from a societal and environmental stand-
</p>
<p>point. Though little has changed on the design front, the single lifecycle product 
</p>
<p>design may diminish in the coming years. 
</p>
<p> In sum, fi rms operating with the single lifecycle design strategy may soon fi nd 
</p>
<p>themselves seeking ways to improve reacquisition of the products through reverse 
</p>
<p>logistics networks at least at the materials level. Without a move away from the sin-
</p>
<p>gle lifecycle philosophy, investment in testing, inspection, and disposition technolo-
</p>
<p>gies and  related   remanufacturing systems will be a moot point. Interestingly, there 
</p>
<p>is recent evidence that select product types should be designed for a single lifecycle

<p>interest in purchasing a multiple lifecycle product. 22   
</p>
<p>21   As noted before, the E.U., Japan, and Australia have all moved toward increasing legislative 
mandates for recycling and waste stream reduction. This increasing legislative pressure has also 
come to the US in the form of California&rsquo;s recycling laws aimed to curbing electronics and other 
waste ( http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/recycle/ ). 
22   Two recent studies shed light on the nature of consumer perceptions of multiple lifecycle prod-
ucts. The fi rst study delves into the various factors that infl uence how consumers perceive multiple

<p>17.3.4     Quadrant IV: Third-Party Reuse 
</p>
<p> The fi nal  quadrant   represents a simple fact: lost profi t opportunities on the part of 
</p>
<p>the original equipment manufacturer. As a case in point, ReCellular started their 
</p>
<p>business by refurbishing Motorola cellular phones when Motorola proclaimed that 
</p>
<p>no one could make money off such a venture. Of course, if the third-party reuse 
</p>
<p>occurs at the materials reclamation (i.e., recycling of plastics) level, the original 
</p>
<p>equipment manufacturer may simply cede such markets for a lack of interest in 
</p>
<p>entering a non-core competence market. However, when the third-party reuse occurs 
</p>
<p>at the component or particularly product level, the original equipment manufacturer 
</p>
<p>has inadvertently created a competitor in their own market space&mdash;a competitor 
</p>
<p>using the original equipment manufacturer&rsquo;s own product. The common excuse for 
</p>
<p>allowing such third-party entry comes straight from Fig.  17.3 : the original equip-
</p>
<p>ment manufacturer views the product or component reuse as a non-core competence 
</p>
<p>region. As such, the original equipment manufacturers argue that reacquisition is 
</p>
<p>simply too expensive or diffi cult, that reverse logistics systems are too hard to man-
</p>
<p>age, and that investment in remanufacturing equipment as well as the related testing, 
</p>
<p>inspection, and disposition processes is simply too risky. Finally, such original 
</p>
<p>equipment manufacturers may also view internal remanufacturing as a source of 
</p>
<p>new sales cannibalization&mdash;a fear shown to be questionable at best. 23  Yet, all these 
</p>
<p>arguments seem to be mythical from the third-party remanufacturer&rsquo;s perspective as 
</p>
<p>thousands of third-party  remanufacturers   make billions in profi ts every year.  
</p>
<p>17.3.5     Contrasting the Quadrants 
</p>
<p> Table  17.1   provides   an accessible summary of the criticality of each major CLSC 
</p>
<p>function available to a manager deciding which quadrant best fi ts with their design- 
</p>
<p>competence status (see Footnote 18).
</p>
<p>   Table  17.1  shows that each quadrant has varying functional dimensions for the 
</p>
<p>closed-loop supply chain. In particular, the Quality, Durability, and Maintainability 
</p>
<p>lifecycle (e.g., remanufactured) products (see Abbey, J. D., et al. 2015. Remanufactured Products 
in Closed-Loop Supply Chains for Consumer Goods.  Production and Operations Management  
24(3): 488&ndash;503.). An even more recent work examines how various consumer segments emerge 
with a sizeable portion&mdash;upwards of 35 %&mdash;of consumers refusing to consider a remanufactured 
product of any kind (see Abbey, J.D., J.D. Blackburn, V.D.R. Guide Jr. 2015. &ldquo;Optimal Pricing for 
New and Remanufactured Products.&rdquo;  Journal of Operations Management  36: 130&ndash;146.). For a 
managerially-oriented discussion of these and expanded topics, see Abbey, J.D., M.G. Meloy, 
J.D. Blackburn, and V.D.R. Guide. 2015. Consumer Markets for Remanufactured and Refurbished 
Products.  California Management Review  57(4): 26&ndash;4. 
23   Fear of new product sales cannibalization when offering a remanufactured product has been a 
long-standing source of opposition for remanufacturing at many fi rms. For a nice discussion of 
such opposition and strategies to handle common issues with potential cannibalization, see Atasu, 
A., V.D.R. Guide, Jr., L.N. Van Wassenhove. 2009. So what if remanufacturing cannibalizes new 
product sales?  California Management Review  52: 56&ndash;76.

</p>
<p>quadrant has little to no CLSC functions as a result of the sales of products and 
</p>
<p>little if any direct interaction with the product post-sale. Conversely, the multiple 
</p>
<p>lifecycle quadrant has relatively simple reverse logistics and marketability by the 
</p>
<p>very nature of the typically vertically integrated system. Nonetheless, the multiple 
</p>
<p>lifecycle quadrant also requires intensive resource investment to remanufacture and 
</p>
<p>extract value from the returned end-of-use products. The single lifecycle (i.e., con-
</p>
<p>sumer products) quadrant usually focuses on minimizing costs related to returned 
</p>
<p>or end-of-use products. As such, third parties provide most logistics needs to mini-
</p>
<p>mize cost, though such a strategy can be a severe mistake for fi rms that face a high 
</p>
<p>marginal value of time market (see Footnote 14). Additionally, the single lifecycle 
</p>
<p>products typically have highly varied reusability due to both the initial design 
</p>
<p>intentions and lack of investment in remanufacturing technologies by the original 
</p>
<p>manufacturer. Further, the marketability of remanufactured single lifecycle prod-
</p>
<p>ucts can be questionable due to varying forces from rapid depreciation, quality 
</p>
<p>concerns, and more. 
</p>
<p> In general, the third party&rsquo;s core business is fi nding innovative ways to extract 
</p>
<p>profi t that the original equipment manufacturers either ignored or missed com-
</p>
<p>pletely. The third parties typically lack easy access to the returned or end-of-use 
</p>
<p>products, which makes reacquiring the products an intensive endeavor. The reman-
</p>
<p>ufacturing and reuse processes must be retrofi tted to the decision made by the exter-
</p>
<p>nal entity&mdash;the original manufacturer. Finally, as the third party rarely has the same 
</p>
<p>market power or existing forward supply chain channels as the original manufac-
</p>
<p>turer,    remarketing the products can also be an intensive challenge. Yet, in spite of 
</p>
<p>all these challenges, third-party remanufacturers are plentiful, and more impor-
</p>
<p>tantly, profi table.   
</p>
<p>17.4     Design and Core Competence: One Size 
</p>
<p>Does Not Fit All 
</p>
<p> The above discussion demonstrates that implementing a true, fully closed-loop sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain requires the vertically integrated, multiple lifecycle design strategy. 
</p>
<p>However, many fi rms may fi nd that complete vertical integration combined with a 
</p>
<p>multiple lifecycle design is both technically infeasible due to the nature of the prod-
</p>
<p>uct and fi nancially infeasible due to requisite investment in reverse logistics and

</p>
<p>remanufacturing facilities. Moreover, a sizeable reuse market may not even exist for 
</p>
<p>products that have a short market lifecycle. As such, to maximize profi tability and 
</p>
<p>environmental benefi ts under the various constraints, the original equipment manu-
</p>
<p>facturer should take an active role in establishing the appropriate level of third party 
</p>
<p>involvement. Recent research describes just such trade-offs with three major strate-
</p>
<p>gies that sit on a continuum from pure outsourcing to pure insourcing. Between 
</p>
<p>these two extreme points sit various levels of hybrid strategies, which are often the 
</p>
<p>best choice for a remanufacturing original equipment manufacturer. Even Xerox, 
</p>
<p>which represents one of the best remanufacturing fi rms in the world, only maintains 
</p>
<p>a limited reverse logistics fl eet with a preference for using third-party logistics car-
</p>
<p>riers to haul end-of-use products back to the centralized remanufacturing facilities. 
</p>
<p>Figure  17.5 , adapted from work by Pinar Martin, provides the basic process fl ow 
</p>
<p>decisions for the vertically integrated remanufacturing, hybrid remanufacturing, 
</p>
<p>and outsourced remanufacturing strategies. 24 
</p>
<p>   The primary difference among  the   strategies is the intensity of remanufacturing 
</p>
<p>operations. Even in the vertically integrated CLSC, both initial manufacturing and 
</p>
<p>remanufacturing still source some components from an external entity (e.g., micro-
</p>
<p>processors or memory cells). Such components are not part of the core-competence 
</p>
<p>24   Pinar Martin has recently released a book on the various levels of remanufacturing strategy as 
well as a scholarly paper on the topic. For those interested in the more managerially oriented mate-
rials, see Martin, P. 2010. Remanufacturing as a Supply Chain Strategy: Business Models and Case 
Studies. Dusseldorf, Germany: VDM Verlag. For those interested in the technical details, see

</p>
<p>of the manufacturer and are often either replaced with new components or tested for 
</p>
<p>viability in the remanufactured product. In the hybrid strategy, fi rms handle some 
</p>
<p>products internally, while third parties handle less complex or less profi table prod-
</p>
<p>ucts. Finally, in the outsourced CLSC, the original manufacturer exerts only mini-
</p>
<p>mal control in the form of performance specifi cations or other inputs. Note that in 
</p>
<p>all cases, the original manufacturer plays some role to prevent an unauthorized third 
</p>
<p>party from entering the market. Obviously, each of the various choices holds signifi -
</p>
<p>cant tradeoffs. Thus, a quick breakdown of the implications for each choice follows 
</p>
<p>starting with the endpoints of vertical integration and outsourcing. 
</p>
<p>17.4.1     Vertically Integrated CLSC Strategy 
</p>
<p> Control  represents   a major impetus for the vertically integrated strategy. Under ver-
</p>
<p>tical integration, a fi rm retains control over the brand name, customer service, intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property, product acquisition, and even the forward and reverse supply 
</p>
<p>chains. However, control creates challenges. For instance, forward supply chain 
</p>
<p>procurement can represent a major hurdle for the remanufacturing operations. If the 
</p>
<p>procurement division has to acquire additional new parts to support the production 
</p>
<p>of new machines but remanufacturing decreases order quantities for new parts, the 
</p>
<p>bulk rate economies of scale in both purchasing and transportation may disappear. 
</p>
<p>Other issues stemming from metrics decisions can also play a signifi cant role. For 
</p>
<p>example, labor and equipment utilization may actually look better with remanufac-
</p>
<p>turing, but variability in production times may increase. Additionally, overhead 
</p>
<p>allocation to both new and remanufactured product production can be a tricky bal-
</p>
<p>ancing act. Too much or too little allocation to either new or remanufactured prod-
</p>
<p>ucts can create major problems for the manufacturing division profi tability.  
</p>
<p>17.4.2     Outsourcing CLSC Strategy 
</p>
<p> If the forward  supply   chain is largely outsourced, then the reverse supply chain and 
</p>
<p>reuse operations will be outsourced as well. Simply put, if a fi rm does not manufac-
</p>
<p>ture, they cannot easily remanufacture. This issue became manifest for Dell. As 
</p>
<p>Dell outsourced more of their forward supply chain production, reuse operations 
</p>
<p>became increasingly more diffi cult. In the end, Dell eventually outsourced of the 
</p>
<p>previously profi table remanufacturing operations. 25  Many other problems emerge 
</p>
<p>when trying to manage a closed-loop supply chain in an outsourced system. 
</p>
<p>Visibility of design fl aws and improvements all but vanish as returned products are 
</p>
<p>25   For a detailed look at Dell&rsquo;s outsourced remanufacturing/refurbishing strategy, see Vitasek, K.,

</p>
<p>not highly accessible for designers to garner feedback. Contractual obligations 
</p>
<p>become vastly more complex as contracting parties must consider both the forward 
</p>
<p>and reverse supply chain contingencies. Moving products that lose value rapidly 
</p>
<p>(i.e., high marginal value of time products) represents a major challenge as the con-
</p>
<p>tracted reverse logistics and reuse partners typically do not possess great compe-
</p>
<p>tence in moving products back to market. In sum, with only a few exceptions, a 
</p>
<p>fully outsourced CLSC  rarely   achieves the same profi tability and environmental 
</p>
<p>benefi ts as a vertically integrated or hybrid strategy.  
</p>
<p>17.4.3     Hybrid CLSC Strategy 
</p>
<p> In a  hybrid strategy, a   fi rm ideally chooses remanufacturing functions that best mesh 
</p>
<p>with core competencies. However, such hedging can be a double-edged sword as 
</p>
<p>fi rms may dismiss profi t opportunities due to lack of a  current  core competence&mdash;
</p>
<p>one that could easily be developed to generate additional profi t. Further, if too many 
</p>
<p>functions are outsourced, the fi rm loses control over design specifi cations, which all 
</p>
<p>but assures diffi culty for remanufacturing. Other issues include intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty, pricing contracts, lack of visibility across the supply chain, and loss of control 
</p>
<p>over both the forward and reverse supply chains. Overall, the hybrid strategy is the 
</p>
<p>most common strategy but always represents a balancing act&mdash;in many cases, the 
</p>
<p>hybrid strategy can create cross-divisional confl ict as different stakeholders fi ght for 
</p>
<p>shares of profi t. 
</p>
<p> In the end, there is no single solution for deciding the right level of insourcing or 
</p>
<p>outsourcing. The next section provides  some   basic guidance and a decision tool 
</p>
<p>when considering the various choices involved in implementing a closed-loop sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain.   
</p>
<p>17.5     Choosing a Closed-Loop Supply Chain Strategy 
</p>
<p> The one clear message so far is that choosing a CLSC strategy is no easy task. As 
</p>
<p>with most decisions, multiple tradeoffs exist when choosing how to compete for more 
</p>
<p>than just maximum profi t. In some industries, such as the earth moving and mining 
</p>
<p>equipment, the decision to remanufacture previously produced machinery is a simple 
</p>
<p>matter of materials availability and obvious profi tability. 26  Unfortunately, the lines 
</p>
<p>26   Caterpillar is proud of their industry-leading remanufacturing and reuse systems. To say that 
remanufacturing and reuse is a core competence of Caterpillar would be an understatement. In any 
given year, Caterpillar reuses more than 120 million pounds of iron alone. For a detailed look at 
Caterpillar&rsquo;s remanufacturing operations, see their website at  http://www.caterpillar.com/en/ 
company/sustainability/remanufacturing.html .

<p>blur as the products become less expensive and more widely distributed. The prob-
</p>
<p>lems compound when the product has a relatively short lifecycle in the market. 
</p>
<p> Figure  17.6   puts   the pieces, originally outlined in Table  17.1 , together with a 
</p>
<p>decision fl ow process for managers considering particular levels of reuse. In some 
</p>
<p>cases, the decision fl ow outlined in Fig.  17.5  might have exceptions. However, 
</p>
<p>based on observations from dozens of companies over dozens of years, the decision 
</p>
<p>fl ow is largely in line  with   successful CLSC strategies.
</p>
<p>   Figure  17.6  summarizes the major levers that all managers must consider when 
</p>
<p>contemplating a CLSC strategy: the product design; product (re)acquisition man-
</p>
<p>agement; reverse logistics; the testing, inspection, and disposition process as well as 
</p>
<p>the remanufacturing processes; and fi nally the remarketing of the reused product, 
</p>
<p>components, or materials. As the fi gure displays, third parties typically play a 
</p>
<p>role&mdash;often signifi cant&mdash;in managing at least some elements of a CLSC. The ques-
</p>
<p>tion managers face is choosing the right level of third-party involvement. 
</p>
<p>17.5.1     The Role of Third Parties Revisited: When and How 
</p>
<p>to Maintain Control 
</p>
<p> As noted in  the   previous section, the choice between internal and third-party activ-
</p>
<p>ities largely sits on a continuum (see Fig.  17.5 ). In only a very few cases does a fi rm 
</p>
<p>do all CLSC activities internally. Xerox and Caterpillar represent uncommon exam-
</p>
<p>ples of fi rms that maintained a signifi cant, vertical control over both the forward and 
</p>
<p>reverse supply chains. For both fi rms, such control has been invaluable in providing 
</p>
<p>improved profi tability, design feedback, and environmental benefi ts. However, such 
</p>
<p>cases of vertically integrated CLSCs are largely the exception. 
</p>
<p> As outsourcing the forward supply chain gained popularity, insourced remanu-
</p>
<p>facturing became increasingly diffi cult. Facilities that used to serve for dual new 
</p>
<p>and remanufacturing production were economically unsustainable for only remanu-

</p>
<p>facturing operations. As a case in point, Dell moved nearly all remanufacturing 
</p>
<p>activities to a third party on a contractual basis as the forward supply chain evolved 
</p>
<p>toward outsourced contract manufacturing (see Footnote 25). However, Dell still 
</p>
<p>maintains contractual control over the third party, which is signifi cantly superior to 
</p>
<p>the all too common strategy of simply ignoring the activity of third parties that will 
</p>
<p>enter the market with or without the original manufacturer&rsquo;s consent. In other words, 
</p>
<p>a complete omission of a remanufacturing strategy opens the door for third parties 
</p>
<p>to extract profi t that could have been controlled by the original manufacturer, which 
</p>
<p>can have signifi cant implications on the original brand&rsquo;s reputation. 27  
</p>
<p> The automotive  industry   serves as a case in point for ceding control over remanu-
</p>
<p>facturing. The remanufactured automotive parts industry has a long-standing tradi-
</p>
<p>tion of heavy third-party involvement. Though Ford and other major automotive 
</p>
<p>manufacturers have tried to make inroads into reuse of parts, third-party players 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Cardone Industries) have maintained a strong control on the automotive parts 
</p>
<p>product acquisition market. 28  During a meeting of original equipment automotive 
</p>
<p>manufacturers and their third-party remanufacturing competitors, an interesting 
</p>
<p>argument emerged: the original equipment manufacturer accused the third party of 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;stealing parts&rdquo; to which the third party responded &ldquo;stop me.&rdquo; Though the original 
</p>
<p>manufacturer may felt entitled to &ldquo;their parts&rdquo;, the original manufacturer had taken 
</p>
<p>no steps to maintain any vertical control after the time of the initial sale. The auto-
</p>
<p>motive industry provides a cautionary message: once an industry cedes control over 
</p>
<p>remanufacturing to third parties,    regaining control over the remanufacturing market 
</p>
<p>can be a diffi cult and costly proposition.   
</p>
<p>17.6     Closing the Loop 
</p>
<p> This chapter provides high-level guidance on the structure of closed-loop supply 
</p>
<p>chain strategies with an overriding theme: third parties will play a role in nearly all 
</p>
<p>closed-loop supply chain systems. As such, manufacturers in the forward supply 
</p>
<p>chain need to make a conscious decision on their closed-loop supply chain strategy: 
</p>
<p>that decision needs to ask when and how third parties should play a role. If the for-
</p>
<p>ward supply chain original manufacturer does not make such conscious decisions, 
</p>
<p>an  unauthorized  third party will make the decision for them by entering the market 
</p>
<p>as a competitor. Even if the prospect of investing in resources&mdash;capital equipment, 
</p>
<p>skilled labor, and reverse logistics networks&mdash;is beyond the core competencies of 
</p>
<p>an original equipment manufacturer, forethought in developing and contracting 
</p>
<p>with third parties can prove valuable. The value of such contracts comes from

<p>18.1            Introduction 
</p>
<p> Supply Chain Management (SCM) has become part of the c-management agenda 
</p>
<p>in Western countries since the 1990s, particularly in the manufacturing and retail 
</p>
<p>industries (Chopra and Meindl  2012 ). More recently, interest in SCM has also been 
</p>
<p>growing in the agrifood industry, both in developed and developing countries. 
</p>
<p>Executives of agrifood companies are aware that successful coordination, integra-
</p>
<p>tion, and management of key business processes in the supply chain will determine 
</p>
<p>their competitive success. Sustainable Food Supply Chain Management (SFSCM) 
</p>
<p>refers to all forward processes in the food chain, like procurement of materials, 
</p>
<p>production and distribution, as well as the reverse processes to collect and process 
</p>

<p>(Van der Vorst et al .   2009 ).  Global consumption   of food has signifi cantly increased 
</p>
<p>due to population growth, alterations in overall nutritional needs and rising eco-
</p>
<p>nomic incomes. This increased consumption has increased the demand for produc-
</p>
<p>tion and distribution of food worldwide leading to severe global economic, social, 
</p>
<p>and environmental problems (Tilman et al.  2002 ). The Food and Agriculture 
</p>
<p>Organization of the United Nations (FAO) states that food sectors have to increase 
</p>
<p>their production and decrease the negative impact of production and distribution 
</p>
<p>simultaneously (FAO  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> This chapter discusses the design of sustainable food supply chains. In Sect. 
</p>
<p> 18.1 , we discuss the key questions related to the concept of a Sustainable Food 
</p>
<p>Supply Chain, which have to do with (1) the typicality of food supply chains, (2) the 
</p>
<p>issue on how to measure sustainability and (3) the impact of food supply chains to 
</p>
<p>improve sustainability. In Sect.  18.2 , we provide a brief  literature review   on these 
</p>
<p>issues, whereas Sect.  18.3  discusses the trends related to these questions, showing 
</p>
<p>future needs in the fi eld of sustainable food supply chains (puzzles that researchers 
</p>
<p>and practitioners need to work on).  
</p>
<p>18.2      What Is a Sustainable Food Supply Chain Design? 
</p>
<p> In this section, we discuss the following key questions:
</p>
<p>    1.    What makes food supply chains different from other supply chains when it 
</p>
<p>comes to sustainability?   
</p>
<p>   2.    What are the key performance indicators for sustainability in food supply chains?   
</p>
<p>   3.    How to redesign food supply chains to improve sustainability?     
</p>
<p>18.2.1     What Makes Food Supply Chains Different Than Other 
</p>
<p>Supply Chains When It Comes to Sustainability? 
</p>
<p> Food supply chains consist of organizations that produce and distribute vegetable or 
</p>
<p>animal-based products to consume. Nowadays, Western-European consumers have 
</p>
<p>become more aware of the origin and nutritional value of their food and expect food 
</p>
<p>in retail stores to be of good quality, to have a decent shelf life and to be fi t for pur-
</p>
<p>pose (Smith and Sparks  2004 ).  Consumers&rsquo; requirements   especially refer to product 
</p>
<p>availability, product quality, and an acceptable price. These requirements need to be 
</p>
<p>taken into account when (re-)designing Food Supply Chains, next to traditional effi -
</p>
<p>ciency and responsiveness requirements (Soysal et al.  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> A number of recent trends such as globalization, urbanization and agro- 
</p>
<p>industrialization make the organization of agrifood chains and networks more com-
</p>
<p>plex, as these networks are rapidly moving towards globally interconnected systems 
</p>
<p>with a large variety of relationships. This is also affecting the ways in which food 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>397
</p>
<p>is produced, processed and delivered at the market. Perishable food products can 
</p>
<p>nowadays be shipped from halfway around the world at fairly competitive prices. 
</p>
<p>Demand and supply are no longer restricted to nations or regions but have also 
</p>
<p>become international processes. The market exerts a dual pressure on agrifood 
</p>
<p>chains, forcing improved coordination among buyers and sellers and continuous 
</p>
<p>innovation. 
</p>
<p> Food Supply Chains are different from other product supply chains. The funda-
</p>
<p>mental difference is the continuous and signifi cant change in the quality of food 
</p>
<p>products throughout the entire supply chain until the point of fi nal consumption. 
</p>
<p>Investments in network design should be aimed at both improving logistic perfor-
</p>
<p>mance and at the preservation of food quality. 
</p>
<p> A Food Supply Chain comprises organizations responsible for the production 
</p>
<p>and distribution of vegetable or animal-based products. These products can be fresh 
</p>
<p>(such as vegetables, fl owers, fruit) or processed (such as portioned meats, snacks, 
</p>
<p>desserts, canned food products). In general, these chains may comprise growers, 
</p>
<p>auctions, wholesalers, importers and exporters, retailers and specialty shops and 
</p>
<p>their input and service suppliers. In fresh supply chains, the main processes are the 
</p>
<p>handling, conditioned storing, packing, transportation, and especially trading of 
</p>
<p>goods. Basically, all these supply chain steps leave the intrinsic characteristics of 
</p>
<p>the product grown or produced in the countryside untouched. In processed food 
</p>
<p>supply chains, agricultural products are used as  raw materials   for producing con-
</p>
<p>sumer products with higher added value. In most cases, conservation and condition-
</p>
<p>ing processes extend the shelf life of the agricultural and consumer products.  
</p>
<p>18.2.2     What Are the Key Performance Indicators 
</p>
<p>for Sustainability in Food Supply Chains? 
</p>
<p>  Traditional performance indicators   such as costs, throughput time or technical 
</p>
<p>quality of products are insuffi cient to fi nd the best sustainable confi guration of the 
</p>
<p>supply chain. To help decision makers to assess the sustainability of their supply 
</p>
<p>chain design, a comprehensive assessment regarding the  Triple Bottom Line (TBL)   
</p>
<p>performance is needed. This  TBL      concept was fi rst used by Elkington ( 2004 ) and 
</p>
<p>relates to a simultaneous consideration and balance of economic, environmental, 
</p>
<p>and social goals from a business point of view (also known as the Triple P philoso-
</p>
<p>phy of People, Planet, and Profi t). 
</p>
<p> Performance measurement tools estimate sustainability throughout indicators. 
</p>
<p>Sustainability indicators are an essential part of the process of assessment, bench-
</p>
<p>marking, and decision making. Indicators play an important role in sustainability 
</p>
<p>assessment to value the current situation. Moreover, indicators help to benchmark 
</p>
<p>the current sustainability performance with that of competitive companies or the 
</p>
<p>required performance to obtain membership in a certifi cate scheme (such as Lean 
</p>
<p>and Green) or the performance required by legislation. Indicators also support 
</p>
<p>18 Sustainable Food Supply Chain Design</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>398
</p>
<p> performance evaluation of management policies and improvement practices. 
</p>
<p>Indicators make visible every change in the social, economic, and environmental 
</p>
<p>dimensions of sustainability. 
</p>
<p> Within the context of Food Supply Chains, the sustainability discussion focuses 
</p>
<p>on the reduction of product waste (products not used for human consumption 
</p>
<p>because the quality is not suitable anymore), number of miles a product has trav-
</p>
<p>elled before it reaches the customer&rsquo;s plate (Food Miles) and all greenhouse gas 
</p>
<p>emissions related to the business processes in the supply chain network (Carbon 
</p>
<p>Footprint, see also Chap.   3     by Boukherroub et al. ( 2017 )).  
</p>
<p>18.2.3     How to Improve Sustainability in Food Supply Chain 
</p>
<p>Design? 
</p>
<p> Van Gogh et al. ( 2013 ) show that about 40 % of food waste relates to supply chain 
</p>
<p>activities. The top four of the causes of  this   spoilage are related to the cold chain 
</p>
<p>storage (conditioned transport and storage of perishable products), handling and 
</p>
<p>packaging. Also the Food and Agricultural Organization acknowledges that sub-
</p>
<p>stantial food loss takes place in  the   supply chain, during postharvesting, processing, 
</p>
<p>and distribution (Fig.  18.1 ).
</p>
<p>   Sustainability of supply chains does imply improvements of a combination of 
</p>
<p>different and sometimes confl icting factors. How to combine economic, social, and 
</p>
<p>environmental indicators? Literature on performance indicators for sustainable 
</p>
<p>logistics shows no consensus. Some authors describe indicators as separate entities, 
</p>
<p>whereas others acknowledge that factors related to sustainable logistics can infl u-
</p>
<p>ence more than one dimension and create several impacts. This change evokes the 
</p>
<p>need for an integrated approach that links food supply chain network decisions to 
</p>
<p>the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social).

<p>Sustainability in itself is not a new research area, but the implication of sustainability 
</p>
<p>in food supply chain networks is quite new. Food Supply Chain Networks are com-
</p>
<p>plex, comprising a wide diversity of products with different characteristics and 
</p>
<p>quality requirements, dynamic interactions, and markets (Soysal et al.  2012 ).   
</p>
<p>18.3      State-of-the-Art in Sustainable Food Supply Chain 
</p>
<p>Design 
</p>
<p> This section describes the state-of-the-art in Sustainable Food Supply Chain Design. 
</p>
<p>First, the literature on Food Supply Chain is discussed; resulting in lessons learned 
</p>
<p>why food logistics is not easy. Second, the latest state-of-the-art on sustainability 
</p>
<p>performance assessment is shown, followed by a literature review of papers discuss-
</p>
<p>ing quantitative models for sustainable food logistics management. 
</p>
<p>18.3.1     Lessons on Food Supply Chains 
</p>
<p> Bourlakis and Weightman ( 2004 ) discuss a list of specifi c process and product  char-
</p>
<p>acteristics   of Food Supply Chain Networks that impact the (re)design process for an 
</p>
<p>FSCN, including the following:
</p>
<p>&bull;    Seasonality in production, requiring global sourcing.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Variable process yields in quantity and quality due to biological variations, sea-
</p>
<p>sonality, and random factors connected with weather, pests, and other biological 
</p>
<p>hazards.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Keeping quality constraints for raw materials, intermediates and fi nished prod-
</p>
<p>ucts, and quality decay while products pass through the supply chain. As a result 
</p>
<p>there is a chance of product shrinkage and stock-outs in retail outlets when prod-
</p>
<p>uct&rsquo;s best-before-dates have passed and/or product quality level has declined too 
</p>
<p>much.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Requirement for conditioned transportation and storage means (e.g., cooling).  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Necessity for lot traceability of work in process due to quality and environmental 
</p>
<p>requirements  and   product responsibility.    
</p>
<p> Due to these  specifi c   characteristics of food products, the partnership thoughts of 
</p>
<p>SCM in FSCs have already received much attention over the past years. These char-
</p>
<p>acteristics have an impact on the supply chain design process (see a.o. Lutke Entrup 
</p>
<p> 2006 ):
</p>
<p> &ndash;    In the overall supply chain, it is important to include shelf life constraints for 
</p>
<p>products and changes in product quality level while a product is progressing 
</p>
<p>through the supply chain (e.g., quality decay or ripening).  
</p>

</p>
<p> &ndash;   In the supply part of the supply chain, agrifood industries need to contract 
</p>
<p>suppliers that can guarantee the supply of raw materials in the right volume, with 
</p>
<p>the right quality at the right place and time. Agrifood supply has long production 
</p>
<p>throughput times (harvesting only 1 or few times a year), there is seasonality in 
</p>
<p>the production, and quality and quantity have a high variability.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   Apart from the suppliers, also the logistic service providers (LSPs) play an 
</p>
<p>important role as the quality of food products depends heavily on the conditions 
</p>
<p>in all steps of the supply chain. For example, exposing products like fresh milk 
</p>
<p>or meat to high temperatures for sometime will signifi cantly reduce the shelf life 
</p>
<p>of these products. The same is true for disturbances in the supply chain that result 
</p>
<p>in long waiting times at customs or in the airports or harbors. Especially for 
</p>
<p>products with a small shelf life (fresh tropical fruits), disturbances cause a sig-
</p>
<p>nifi cant percentage of food spoilage.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   For the food industry, process yields are variable in quantity and quality. 
</p>
<p>Alternative process routes and recipes exist for producing the same product. 
</p>
<p>Cleaning and processing times are product-dependent and lot traceability is very 
</p>
<p>important.  
</p>
<p> &ndash;   Supply chain coordination is essential to take appropriate decisions on condi-
</p>
<p>tioned transport. For retailers, the seasonal supply of products requires often 
</p>
<p>global sourcing.     
</p>
<p>18.3.2     Lessons on Sustainability Key Performance Indicators 
</p>
<p>for Food Chains 
</p>
<p> In 1992, in the context of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 
</p>
<p>the Earth Summit recognized in chapter 40 of its proceedings called Agenda 21, the 
</p>
<p>urge for clear and universal metrics of sustainable development. In the opinion of 
</p>
<p>the committee, the need for reliable and pertinent indicators that are able to guide 
</p>
<p>the shift towards sustainability arises from the incapability of current measurement 
</p>
<p>systems to evaluate this aspect. The new standards are required to illustrate both 
</p>
<p>policy makers and the general public the linkages and trade-offs between economic, 
</p>
<p>environmental, and social values as well as to evaluate and monitor the long-term 
</p>
<p>implications of current decisions and behaviors, from the double-edged perspective 
</p>
<p>of institutions and businesses. 
</p>
<p> According to  the   FAO report in 2012, more than one hundred countries have 
</p>
<p>established national strategies for sustainable development, including sustainability 
</p>
<p>targets and indicators. In spite of the abundant attempts for making food and agri-
</p>
<p>culture sectors sustainable, no internationally accepted standard defi nes what &ldquo;sus-
</p>
<p>tainable food production&rdquo; essentially requires (FAO  2012 ). &ldquo;Neither a commonly 
</p>
<p>accepted set of indicators that have to be taken into account when measuring sus-
</p>
<p>tainability performance, nor widely accepted defi nitions of the minimum require-
</p>
<p>ments that would allow a company to qualify as &lsquo;sustainable,&rsquo; exist&rdquo; (FAO  2012 : 9).

</p>
<p> The FAO developed the guidelines for Sustainability Assessment of Food and 
</p>
<p>Agriculture systems (SAFA). SAFA suggest a comprehensive list of sustainability 
</p>
<p>indicators in different categories including both qualitative and quantitative indica-
</p>
<p>tors. These indicators relate mainly to production processes at farm level. Baldwin 
</p>
<p>( 2009 ) evaluates  the   sustainability indicators especially in the logistic part of food 
</p>
<p>chains. Table  18.1  summarizes these indicators, where the fi rst block relates more to 
</p>
<p>production processes and the second block to the logistics processes.
</p>
<p>   The supply chain processes (e.g., transport and storage) have a signifi cant impact 
</p>
<p>on  global warming   because food is often shipped long distances. Although the 
</p>
<p>impact of transportation is important, lifecycle analyses (LCAs) indicate that for 
</p>
<p>most foods, transportation does not have the largest environmental impact (see 
</p>
<p>Chap.   2    , Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 ) for more on LCA). However, as many options 
</p>
<p>are available for delivering food to consumers, these supply chain confi gurations 
</p>
<p>have vastly differing energy and emissions profi les, and therefore evaluating trade- 
</p>
<p>offs and opportunities is necessary for a signifi cant improvement in sustainability 
</p>
<p>for food supply chains (Wakeland et al.  2012 ).

<p> The  UK Sustainable Development Commission   formulates the following 
</p>
<p>characteristics referred to the sustainable supply chains: safe and healthy produc-
</p>
<p>tion support the existence of the rural communities, elimination of the overusage of 
</p>
<p>natural resources, reaching high environmental performance throughout less con-
</p>
<p>sumption of energy and of resource inputs as well as throughout exploiting more 
</p>
<p>renewable energy. Providing safe and hygienic working environment for the 
</p>
<p>employees, establishing high standards of animal health and welfare, sustaining the 
</p>
<p>level of available resources for meeting the needs of the society are also part of the 
</p>
<p>characteristics of the sustainable supply chains. 
</p>
<p> The main hotspots that relate to sustainability are the impact on energy (emis-
</p>
<p>sions, carbon footprint) and materials (spoilage and waste). Researchers have pro-
</p>
<p>posed mathematical optimization models to (re-)design the Food Supply Chain 
</p>
<p>taking into account the aforementioned sustainability KPIs. The following part 
</p>
<p>presents a review of these models. 
</p>
<p>18.3.2.1     Lessons on Sustainable Food Supply Chain Design Models 
</p>
<p> Food supply chain network design coordinates a variety of activities such as trans-
</p>
<p>portation, inventory management, facility location, or production planning. These 
</p>
<p> activities   require several decisions to be made, which can be related to strategic 
</p>
<p>(e.g., determining location and sizes of facilities in a supply chain), tactical (e.g., 
</p>
<p>determining inventory replenishment times) and operational (e.g., determining 
</p>
<p>resulting routes to deliver products to the fi nal destinations) levels of planning and 
</p>
<p>execution. Food supply chain network design, therefore, determines the structure of 
</p>
<p>a food chain and has the potential to affect supply chain KPIs such as cost and 
</p>
<p>responsiveness. 
</p>
<p> While managing the supply chain activities, sustainable food supply chain net-
</p>
<p>work design takes environmental and social externalities of operations into account 
</p>
<p>besides traditional cost concerns. The introduced indicators in the previous subsec-
</p>
<p>tions are used to assess the performance of a supply chain in terms of managing 
</p>
<p>these externalities. 
</p>
<p> Operations Research literature presents various decision support tools to better 
</p>
<p>manage (sustainable) food supply chain network design problems. We conducted a 
</p>
<p>literature review on quantitative studies to analyze the currently available quantita-
</p>
<p>tive models and point out modelling challenges in sustainable food supply chain 
</p>
<p>network design problems. Literature  search   is carried out within well-known data-
</p>
<p>bases, Thomson Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, 
</p>
<p>EBSCO, and followed by reference and citation analyses to fi nd related contribu-
</p>
<p>tions. The following search criteria are employed: food supply chain distribution 
</p>
<p>planning, food supply chain quantitative models, food supply chain network design, 
</p>
<p>sustainable food supply chains, network design for perishable products, location 
</p>
<p>and allocation models, and green network design.

</p>
<p> Analyzing the used indicators, we observe that perishability-related sustainability 
</p>
<p>concerns such as food waste and quality decay have received more attention than 
</p>
<p>other sustainability concerns such as emissions and energy use. 
</p>
<p> Figure  18.2  shows  the   distribution of 55 studies between 1987 and 2014. We 
</p>
<p>consider four groups in the  literature   on food supply chains: (1) no perishability and 
</p>
<p>no other sustainability issues taken into account, (2) both concerns: perishability 
</p>
<p>and at least one other sustainability concern have been taken into account (i.e., 
</p>
<p>emissions, water, accrued jobs), (3) Only perishability-related sustainability con-
</p>
<p>cern has been considered, and (4) Only other sustainability concern: has at least one 
</p>
<p>other sustainability concern which is not directly related  with   perishability. Note 
</p>
<p>that all of these groups have cost or profi t concerns, which relate to the economic 
</p>
<p>dimension of sustainability.
</p>
<p>   The reviewed  studies   along with regarded sustainability aspects in food supply 
</p>
<p>chain network design models  are   presented in Table  18.2 . According to the results, 
</p>
<p>the number of studies on food supply chain network design has been increasing in 
</p>
<p>the last years. Moreover, incorporating perishability-related sustainability concerns 
</p>
<p>and the other sustainability considerations into the developed food supply chain 
</p>
<p>network design models is becoming trendy. The main reasons for the increased 
</p>
<p>interest to the sustainability are (1) pressures from various stakeholders such as 
</p>
<p>customers and nongovernmental organizations, (2) global competition and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic concerns, and (3) legislation.
</p>
<p>   The review of the literature shows that most studies assume that products have 
</p>
<p>fi xed shelf lives and deteriorate based on time (e.g., Ekşioğlu and Jin  2006 ; Soysal 
et al.  2014 ; Ahuja et al.  2007 ). In these studies, product quality decays occur either in 
</p>
<p>a linear way (e.g., Ahumada and Villalobos  2009 ) or in other ways such as  exponential 
</p>
<p>(e.g., Blackburn and Scudder  2009 ). While managing product perishability, some

</p>
<p>studies take also other parameters into account such as temperature, enthalpy, and 
</p>
<p>color through specifi c quality decay models (e.g., Linnemann et al.  2014 ; Ahumada 
</p>
<p>et al.  2012 ; Gong et al.  2007 ). 
</p>
<p> Another fi nding is that the developed models do not always allow product wastes. 
</p>
<p>In some cases, products have to be used within the limited time period and waste 
</p>
<p>cannot occur (e.g., Soysal et al.  2014 ; Seyedhosseini and Ghoreyshi  2014 ). In other 
</p>
<p>cases, it is not always possible to use products before they are spoiled (e.g., Wang 
</p>
<p>et al.  2010 ). 
</p>
<p> Lastly, some researchers do not focus on quality decay during only storage, but 
</p>
<p>also have addressed temperature tracking during  transportation   through temperature- 
</p>
<p>controlled trucks or multi-temperature logistics (e.g., Bosona and Gebresenbet 
</p>
<p> 2011 ; Hsu and Liu  2011 ). 
</p>
<p> Regarding sustainability indicators which are not related to perishability, it has 
</p>
<p>been observed from the literature that energy use and emissions are the most 
</p>
<p>acknowledged indicators in the  reviewed models   (e.g., Validi et al.  2014 ; Van der 
</p>
<p>Vorst et al.  2009 ; Pan et al.  2014 ). The other issues addressed in the studies are the 
</p>
<p>following: nutritional content of products (e.g., Oglethorpe  2010 ), water use (e.g., 
</p>
<p>Ahumada and Villalobos  2009 ), number of accrued jobs (e.g., Ahumada et al. 
</p>
<p> 2012 ), and energy levels of operations (e.g., Linnemann et al.  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> As discussed above, researchers rely on several assumptions while managing 
</p>
<p>sustainability in food supply chain network design problems. These assumptions 
</p>
<p>obviously affect the developed decision support models and therefore the resultant 
</p>
<p>food supply chain network design plans. Concluding, while modelling sustainable 
</p>
<p>food supply designs, the following issues have to be taken into account:
</p>
<p>    1.    The main factors affecting   shelf life of products    have to be determined. Food 
</p>
<p>science literature can be consulted to have a better insight in the perishability 
</p>
<p>nature of food products. If a specifi c quality decay model exists for the studied 
</p>
<p>problem, this model or its simplifi cation can be employed to tackle with the per-
</p>
<p>ishability of the product. The existing models can be too complex to simplify or 
</p>
<p>they may require many parameters which are diffi cult to obtain. Otherwise, 
</p>
<p>generic models which are proposed for food products can be used. For instance, 
</p>
<p>the generic model used in Rong et al. ( 2011 ) to estimate product shelf life could 
</p>
<p>be an option. The model is dependent on various parameters such as storage 
</p>
<p>time, temperature, activation energy, etc.   
</p>
<p>   2.      Product waste risk    should not be ignored in food supply chain network design 
</p>
<p>problems. Due to several reasons such as service level requirements and demand 
</p>
<p>uncertainty, it could be inevitable to have zero product waste. As shown in Soysal 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2015 ), the ignorance of product perishability in a quantitative model for a 
</p>
<p>special supply chain problem might lead to higher product wastes, infeasible 
</p>
<p>solutions, and unsatisfi ed service level targets. Therefore, decision support mod-
</p>
<p>els for food supply chain problems should take potential product waste into 
</p>
<p>account.   
</p>
<p>   3.    Product quality decays do not occur only during storage. Products start to dete-
</p>
<p>riorate even before they are completely produced or ready for the consumption. 
</p>
<p>18 Sustainable Food Supply Chain Design</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>406
</p>
<p>This fact requires tracking product quality throughout the whole chain starting 
</p>
<p>from production to the point of consumption. The interested reader is referred to 
</p>
<p>the study of van der Vorst et al. ( 2011 ). They claim that a   quality controlled 
</p>
<p>chain    could bring the benefi ts of higher product availability, constant quality, 
</p>
<p>and less product losses by the help of controlling goods in a proactive manner 
</p>
<p>and having better established supply chain designs.   
</p>
<p>   4.    Most of the sustainability indicators for food supply chains introduced in Table 
</p>
<p> 18.1  have not been incorporated in food supply chain network design models. 
</p>
<p>However, social awareness on these sustainability indicators has been growing in 
</p>
<p>practice. It might be thus expected that future OR models can comprise an 
</p>
<p>  extended set of sustainability indicators    to better aid decision makers in sus-
</p>
<p>tainable food supply chain management.   
</p>
<p>   5.    Researchers often use simple models or approaches to estimate sustainability 
</p>
<p>indicators, which results in rough calculations of e.g., water consumption or 
</p>
<p>energy use. More interdisciplinary research is required to advance our under-
</p>
<p>standing of sustainability-related KPIs. Quantitative approaches which are pro-
</p>
<p>posed in other research fi elds to estimate performance of sustainability 
</p>
<p>indicators can be incorporated into the decision support models in Operations 
</p>
<p>Research.   
</p>
<p>   6.    Most studies put boundaries to the sustainability considerations, i.e., taking 
</p>
<p>energy use from  transportation   into account but ignoring energy used for stock-
</p>
<p>ing, which restricts the assessment of environmental or social impacts associated 
</p>
<p>with all the stages of a product&rsquo;s life. These limited views can affect the trade-off 
</p>
<p>relationships among KPIs and therefore the resulting plans in network manage-
</p>
<p>ment. Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) models can be combined with OR models to 
</p>
<p>better estimate the externalities of products from cradle-to-grave (see also 
</p>
<p>Chap.   2     by Guin&eacute;e and Heijungs ( 2017 )).     
</p>
<p> To conclude: the research on food supply chain network design is still develop-
</p>
<p>ing considering the extension of the traditional approaches through taking environ-
</p>
<p>mental and social considerations of the supply chain operations into account. These 
</p>
<p>enhanced models can better capture current food supply chain dynamics and 
</p>
<p>improve food quality and safety, availability of food, and create sustainable and 
</p>
<p>effi cient business networks, which are the main issues faced by stakeholders in food 
</p>
<p>supply chains (Soysal et al.  2012 ).    
</p>
<p>18.4     Practical Implications: Trends in Sustainable Food 
</p>
<p>Supply Chains 
</p>
<p> Here, we discuss the impact of trends in the coming years on the agrifood sector. We 
</p>
<p>discuss the impact of urbanization and the upcoming of sustainable modalities. 
</p>
<p>Further, we discuss the development of Sustainability Dashboards.

</p>
<p>18.4.1     Impact of Urbanization 
</p>
<p> First,  the    demographic   developments are such that more people live on the planet, 
</p>
<p>but less people live in Western-Europe. More people live in urban areas in an indi-
</p>
<p>vidualized society. In 2015, already 60 % of the world population lives in cities. 
</p>
<p>This results in an increase of demand for meat, fi sh, and dairy, while the employ-
</p>
<p>ment rate for farming activities in the countryside drops. The  carbon footprint   of 
</p>
<p>meat and fi sh is on average much higher than that of vegetables and grains. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, land, material, and energy use will increase as well as the amount of food 
</p>
<p>spoilage and waste. Secondly, climate change will result in a decrease in the variety 
</p>
<p>of species. Nowadays, only 150 different crops are harvested worldwide resulting in 
</p>
<p>a drop of biodiversity. Only 12 crops are responsible for 75 % of the world food 
</p>
<p>production, making this system very vulnerable. One of the practical implications 
</p>
<p>of sustainability in food supply chains is the shift in production activities. Agrifood 
</p>
<p>production will move to cheap countries, but there will be also a focus on locally 
</p>
<p>produced products (e.g., urban farming). 
</p>
<p> Urban farming gives an opportunity to operate more independently from global 
</p>
<p>threats related to climate, prices, and political stability. Urban farming can lead to a 
</p>
<p>variety of meaningful social functions. However, urban farming also asks for a new 
</p>
<p>way of short-distance logistics to ensure that processed and unprocessed products 
</p>
<p>are distributed fast and safe to the places in the city where consumers need them. 
</p>
<p>Metropolitan food clusters and logistic lines around the major global cities will 
</p>
<p>provide residents with suffi cient food. 
</p>
<p> As distribution  is   one of the main sources of food waste and carbon emissions in 
</p>
<p>the food lifecycle, this is another motivation to a shift in food production activities. 
</p>
<p>Geographically local supply chains are considered to be more sustainable due to the 
</p>
<p>encouragement of the rural enterprising and the opposition against the  agriculture 
</p>
<p>  monopolies (Smith and Sparks  2004 ). 
</p>
<p> In the future, we expect a combination of global low-cost agrifood production 
</p>
<p>with local sustainable high-quality agrifood production.  
</p>
<p>18.4.2     Emission Driven Transportation 
</p>
<p> At the moment,  initiatives   start all over the world. In California, USA, sustainable 
</p>
<p>freight pathways to zero and near-zero emissions are explored. Zero-emission drive-
</p>
<p>train technologies have been developed for on-road heavy-duty freight vehicles and 
</p>
<p>100 % solar-powered and wind-powered cargo ships make their way through the 
</p>
<p>seas (e.g., the Turanor Planet Solar, Eco Marine Power, Green Marine, and the 
</p>
<p>Dutch Ecoliners). Low Emission Zones in cities (such as London) do not allow 
</p>
<p>entrance to vehicles that do not satisfy the emission requirements.  Electric vehicles   
</p>
<p>could be a solution for entering these zones, but requires extra handling at the bor-
</p>
<p>ders of the city (Blanco and Sheffi  ( 2017 ) discuss green logistics in greater detail in 
</p>
<p>Chap.   7    ).

</p>
<p>18.4.2.1     Sustainability Dashboards 
</p>
<p>  Sustainability   assessment aims to facilitate the decision making process related to 
</p>
<p>actions which are needed to provide sustainability in short-term or long-term per-
</p>
<p>spective for global or local systems. At the moment, most Business Dashboards 
</p>
<p>focus only on numerical economic results and do not take into account the numeri-
</p>
<p>cal visualization of social and environmental indicators. 
</p>
<p> One tool for visualizing sustainability results is the Dashboard of Sustainability. 
</p>
<p>The Dashboard of Sustainability is elaborated by the Consultative Group on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development Indices and the Joint Research Centre. It dates from the 
</p>
<p>end of the 1990 and measures the economic, social, and environmental dimensions 
</p>
<p>of sustainability. The Sustainability Dashboard allows comparing different scenar-
</p>
<p>ios taking into account the economic, social, and institutional trends. The informa-
</p>
<p>tion which needs to be measured is organized in three levels:
</p>
<p>    1.    Individual indicators for sustainability evaluation   
</p>
<p>   2.    Synthetic indexes which integrate multiple indicators into one single indicator 
</p>
<p>(Environment, Economy, Society)   
</p>
<p>   3.    Index of overall sustainability (Sustainability Development Index or Policy 
</p>
<p>Performance Index) which averages the synthetic indexes     
</p>
<p> The information is presented in a numerical and graphical way. The individual 
</p>
<p>indicators are assigned to segments. The achievements of the indicators for all dif-
</p>
<p>ferent contexts are revealed by the color of the segment. Usually the color varies 
</p>
<p>from dark green (excellent) to dark red (very bad). 
</p>
<p> Bloemhof et al. ( 2015 ) collected primary and secondary data on sustainability 
</p>
<p>KPIs from food and logistics companies in the Netherlands.  Results   show that 
</p>
<p>energy and water use as well as emissions have most attention from food industry; 
</p>
<p>carbon footprints  are   central to LSPs (Chapter   4     by Hoekstra ( 2017 ) focuses on 
</p>
<p>water footprinting).    
</p>
<p>18.5     Future Needs 
</p>
<p> For a more sustainable food supply chain, a redesign of the food supply chain net-
</p>
<p>work is necessary. To meet the future challenges on sustainability and effi ciency, 
</p>
<p>biomass materials must be converted into valuable products. Future food supply 
</p>
<p>chains are not only challenged to increase productivity, but also to supply energy 
</p>
<p>and other biobased products without compromising on resources availability and 
</p>
<p>resource effi ciency. This requires a biobased circular economy, i.e., encompassing 
</p>
<p>the sustainable production of biomass and its conversion into food, feed, biobased 
</p>
<p>materials, and bioenergy. So far, optimization models have only been used to fi nd 
</p>
<p>the optimal route for the production of food products or biofuels (Zondervan et al. 
</p>
<p> 2011 ). This needs to be extended to a multiproduct optimization to create food, 
</p>
<p>feed, fuel, chemicals, and materials from biomass.

</p>
<p> Research will be necessary in the fi eld of time-dependent environmental conditions, 
</p>
<p>under which products are (re)packed (e.g., using modifi ed atmosphere packaging), 
</p>
<p>stored, and transported (e.g., using reefer containers), in order to improve on food 
</p>
<p>quality. This will result in longer shelf lives, and therefore, less spoilage. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>emphasis should be put on redesigning processes in order to reduce greenhouse gas 
</p>
<p>emissions and energy consumption. The transition towards a sustainable food chain 
</p>
<p>is a challenge for the food sector. Future food chains should operate in synergy with 
</p>
<p>environmental, social, and economic aspects leading to the following targets:
</p>
<p>    1.     Improve resource effi ciency and effectiveness in the food chain:  prevent food 
</p>
<p>spoilage and shrinkage, optimal valorization of by-products and waste streams, 
</p>
<p>extending shelf life of food products.   
</p>
<p>   2.     Effi cient supply chain networks:  reduction of CO 2  emissions in food logistics 
</p>
<p>reducing transport kilometers improves mobility.   
</p>
<p>   3.     Reduces environmental impact of packaging,  reduces carbon emissions related 
</p>
<p>to plastic packaging materials and improve recycling rates.

<p>19.1          Introduction 
</p>
<p> Supply chains are the backbone of the  global economy   as well as a major infl uence 
</p>
<p>on the social and natural business environment (van der Vegt et al.  2015 ). In today&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>globalized world, every organization is part of at least one supply chain. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>the majority of everyday transactions - withdrawing money, eating in a restaurant, 
</p>
<p>shopping for food or clothes, ordering something online - involves participation in 
</p>
<p>a supply chain. As such, supply chains are the channels via which resources, serv-
</p>
<p>ices, and information fl ow from the originating supplier to the end user. A compa-
</p>
<p>ny&rsquo;s relationships across their supply chains combined with increasing globalization 
</p>
<p>have facilitated worldwide operations, better communication, and the ability to inte-
</p>
<p>grate enlarged product variety and greater consumer choice. Simultaneously, the 
</p>
<p>emergence of longer and more complex supply chains and relationships, shorter 
</p>
<p>product lifecycles, increased competitive pressure, and environmental uncertainty 
</p>
<p>(Mentzer et al.  2001 ) have exposed every business to the risk of unexpected distur-
</p>
<p>bances that can lead to fi nancial losses and in some cases fi rm closures (Skipper and 
</p>
<p>Hanna  2009 ). Our world is increasingly uncertain (Tang  2006 ) and our supply 
</p>
<p>chains more vulnerable than ever (Wagner and Bode  2008 ). 
</p>
<p>  Vulnerability   in the supply chain centers around the disruption of information, 
</p>
<p>product, service, knowledge, control coordination, or monetary fl ows between 
</p>
<p>organizations (J&uuml;ttner  2005 ; Narasimhan and Talluri  2009 ) and as a result exposes 
</p>
<p>organizations to risks (Craighead et al.  2007 ). On a daily basis, newspaper headlines

<p>highlight the consequences of risks: Toyota&rsquo;s product recalls in 2012, the horse 
</p>
<p>meat scandal in 2013, industrial action at airports in France, Germany, and Belgium 
</p>
<p>in 2014, the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in 2012, the volcanic ash 
</p>
<p>eruption in Iceland in 2010 are only some of many examples that caused disruptions 
</p>
<p>to supply chains globally. Each year 75 % of companies experience at least one sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain disruption adding up to more than &euro;1 M in costs for a single incident for 
</p>
<p>21 % of them; causes range from workforce strikes to adverse weather conditions, 
</p>
<p>currency exchange rates, energy scarcity, service provision failures, and IT break-
</p>
<p>downs (Business Continuity Institute  2013 ). Even a relatively minor problem within 
</p>
<p>a supply chain can have signifi cant consequences: a late delivery of raw materials 
</p>
<p>can affect operations, with knock-on effects to company reputation, perception of 
</p>
<p>brands, ability to win orders, quality, prices, profi t margins, and lead times (Waters 
</p>
<p> 2011 ). At worst, these contingencies can threaten the continuity and hence sustain-
</p>
<p>ability of organizations as has been shown in the past (van der Vegt et al.  2015 ). 
</p>
<p>Hendricks and Singhal ( 2005 ) found that companies facing supply chain disruptions 
</p>
<p>experience 33&ndash;40 % lower  stock returns   relative to their industry benchmarks over 
</p>
<p>a 3-year period (one year before and two years after the disruption announcement 
</p>
<p>date). At the same time, this might affect society as a downturn in fi nancial perfor-
</p>
<p>mance often results in labor redundancies. Other disruptions have impacted severely 
</p>
<p>on the environment e.g., the Deep Water Horizon Spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 
</p>
<p>2010 with subsequent long-term consequences for society in terms of water clean-
</p>
<p>ness and the oil and gas industry in terms of policies. As the examples above illus-
</p>
<p>trate, disruptions can affect any of the three dimensions of sustainability. 
</p>
<p> While the possibility of a disruption to a single facility or  supplier   may be rela-
</p>
<p>tively small, the probability in the end-to-end collective supply chain is much 
</p>
<p>greater (Knemeyer et al.  2009 ). The network architecture of a supply chain is struc-
</p>
<p>tured around a chain of decision nodes, where each node plays a role in adding value 
</p>
<p>to fi nal products and/or services. At the same time, each node also contributes to the 
</p>
<p>risk profi le in a positive or negative way (Ritchie and Brindley  2007a ). For those 
</p>
<p>reasons, fi rms are required to pay attention to factors such as labor conditions 
</p>
<p>(social), fi nancial stability (economic), and emissions (environmental) of their sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain members. Yet, organizations frequently overlook such critical exposure to 
</p>
<p>risk along their supply chains (J&uuml;ttner et al.  2003 ). Customers, however, are less 
</p>
<p>concerned about why or where a disruption occurred; they expect the fi nal product 
</p>
<p>or service to be available to them at the right time and price (Elkins et al.  2005 ). 
</p>
<p>Therefore, managers must delicately balance inventory, capacity, and other ele-
</p>
<p>ments at appropriate levels across the entire supply chain in a dynamic, fast- 
</p>
<p>changing environment (Chopra and Sodhi  2004 ). 
</p>
<p> Supply chain risk management and supply chain uncertainty management via 
</p>
<p>resilience are the managerial counterparts of the concept of supply chain vulnerabil-
</p>
<p>ity (J&uuml;ttner  2005 ). This relationship is depicted in Fig.  19.1 .  The   ultimate objective 
</p>
<p>is to ensure that supply chains continue to work as planned, with smooth and unin-
</p>
<p>terrupted fl ows of materials, information, and money from initial suppliers through 
</p>
<p>to the fi nal customers (Waters  2011 ). Hence, risk and uncertainty management con-
</p>
<p>tribute to  business survival   by limiting vulnerabilities and are therefore recognized 
</p>

</p>
<p>by many organizations as an essential contributor to sustainable operations (Carter 
</p>
<p>and Rogers  2008 ). While risk and uncertainty are intimately linked, they are not the 
</p>
<p>same: risk is something measurable in the sense that estimates can be made of the 
</p>
<p>probabilities of outcomes; uncertainty is not quantifi able and hence probabilities of 
</p>
<p>possible outcomes are unknown (Khan and Burnes  2007 ). As such, risk is the 
</p>
<p>expected outcome of an uncertain event (Manuj and Mentzer  2008b ), whereas vul-
</p>
<p>nerability is the exposure to serious disturbance arising from supply chain risks 
</p>
<p>(J&uuml;ttner  2005 ).
</p>
<p>   This chapter sets out to examine how supply chain risk and uncertainty manage-
</p>
<p>ment practices support organizations and their supply chains in achieving long-
</p>
<p>term sustainability, whether it is in relation to economic, environmental, or societal 
</p>
<p>factors. Firstly, we examine the process of  supply chain risk management  including 
</p>
<p> risk identifi cation ,  risk assessment, and analysis  as well as  risk management strate-
</p>
<p>gies  and how these enable decisions; we then show how  uncertainty management  
</p>
<p>extends traditional supply chain risk management and how supply chain resilience 
</p>
<p>enables organizations and their supply chains to also deal with unforeseeable 
</p>
<p>events. Furthermore, we will discuss  disaster management  from a humanitarian 
</p>
<p>perspective as a source of learning for uncertainty management in commercial sup-
</p>
<p>ply chains. We conclude with a summary and a refl ection.  
</p>
<p>19.2     Supply Chain Risk Management 
</p>
<p> While a crisis in a supply chain may be unpredictable, it may not be unexpected. 
</p>
<p>To deal with and reduce the impact of global supply chain risk, existing theory sug-
</p>
<p>gests that businesses follow a course of action from risk identifi cation to strategies 
</p>
<p>specifi cally aimed at managing risk (Manuj and Mentzer  2008a ). Effective supply

</p>
<p>chain risk management tries to do exactly that: identifying and managing risks in 
</p>
<p>the supply chain through a synchronized approach among supply chain members, to 
</p>
<p>lessen supply chain vulnerability as a whole (Faisal et al.  2006 ; J&uuml;ttner  2005 ). 
</p>
<p>Proactively identifying where and when  vulnerability   is present creates the potential 
</p>
<p>to avoid risks, prevent them from actually happening and reduce or mitigate their 
</p>
<p>impact (Waters  2011 ).  Stages   in the risk management processes (labels differ among 
</p>
<p>authors although the steps are similar see e.g., Manuj and Mentzer ( 2008a ) or J&uuml;ttner 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2003 )) include risk identifi cation (or estimation), risk assessment (or analy-
</p>
<p>sis), evaluation to make a choice between strategies to manage risk as well as ongo-
</p>
<p>ing monitoring (Norrman and Jansson  2004 ). To be able to conduct the risk 
</p>
<p>management process effectively, top management support is required so that a 
</p>
<p>shared, supply chain-wide understanding and awareness of risks is created (Chopra 
</p>
<p>and Sodhi  2004 ; Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ). Only then can ongoing monitoring and con-
</p>
<p>trol be conducted successfully as an essential part of the risk management pro-
</p>
<p>cesses. The stages of the risk management process will be further outlined in the 
</p>
<p>following sections.

</p>
<p> The identifi cation of risk sources is an important step in the risk management proc-
</p>
<p>ess as decision-makers become aware of events that may cause disturbances 
</p>
<p>(Norrman and Jansson  2004 ). It encompasses a comprehensive and structured deter-
</p>
<p>mination of potential supply chain risks (Tummala and Schoenherr  2011 ). Risks to 
</p>
<p>the supply chain consist of anything that may interrupt the normal fl ows of the chain 
</p>
<p>and as a consequence expose organizations within the supply chain to economic, 
</p>
<p>environmental, and societal consequences (Craighead et al.  2007 ). Hence, there are 
</p>
<p>a huge number of possible risks that can appear in almost endless variety (Waters 
</p>
<p> 2011 ): sources of risk can be organizational, supply chain or environmental-related 
</p>
<p>factors that affect the supply chain performance (Faisal et al.  2006 ; Peck et al.  2003 ; 
</p>
<p>J&uuml;ttner  2005 ) - see Fig.  19.2 .  Taken   together these risks defi ne the vulnerability of a 
</p>
<p>supply chain (Waters  2011 ).
</p>
<p>&bull;      Organizational risk sources:     Organizational sources of risk affect the operational 
</p>
<p>side of an organization (Manuj and Mentzer  2008a ). Hence, they are internal to 
</p>
<p>any organization and relate to processes and controls (Peck et al.  2003 ; J&uuml;ttner 
</p>
<p> 2005 ). Processes facilitate the management and production of value in an organ-
</p>
<p>ization in the form of products and services for the end consumer (Christopher 
</p>
<p> 1998 ). Risk inherent in processes can relate to accidents, the reliability of equip-
</p>
<p>ment, loss of an information technology system and quality issues (Waters  2011 ). 
</p>
<p>Variability in processes can be managed via controls, which are assumptions, 
</p>
<p>rules, systems, and procedures such as order quantities, batch sizes, and safety 
</p>
<p>stocks (Christopher and Peck  2004 ). Therefore, risks in relation to controls arise 
</p>
<p>more directly from human decision making via the application or misapplication 
</p>
<p>of these assumptions, rules, systems,    or procedures (Peck et al.  2003 ).

</p>
<p>&bull;    Network risk sources:  Network  risks   are internal to the supply network but 
</p>
<p>external to an organization (J&uuml;ttner et al.  2003 ). As such, these sources are prone 
</p>
<p>to affect a number of interdependent parties in a supply chain (J&uuml;ttner  2005 ). 
</p>
<p>Network risk sources refer to the possibility and impact of a mismatch between 
</p>
<p>supply and demand (J&uuml;ttner et al.  2003 ). Therefore, network risks have been 
</p>
<p>categorized as originating from the demand or the supply side. Demand and sup-
</p>
<p>ply risks occur from the interactions between members of the supply chain and 
</p>
<p>are often caused by inadequate coordination between members and lack of visi-
</p>
<p>bility (Waters  2011 ).    
</p>
<p> Demand risk relates to vulnerabilities associated with the outbound logistics 
</p>
<p>fl ows and product demand (J&uuml;ttner  2005 ). It can be any potential or actual distur-
</p>
<p>bance within the network to the supply chain fl ows downstream (Christopher and 
</p>
<p>Peck  2004 ) such as variable demand, payments, problem with order processing, 
</p>
<p>or customized requirements (Waters  2011 ). Demand risks vary with the nature of 
</p>
<p>the product, with functional products generally less exposed to risks than innova-
</p>
<p>tive products (Fisher  1997 ; Manuj and Mentzer  2008a ). Similarly, on the supply 
</p>
<p>side, risks are associated with possible events that may affect the inbound fl ows 
</p>
<p>(Manuj and Mentzer  2008a ). Hence, supply risks are related to supplier actions 
</p>
<p>or supplier relationships (J&uuml;ttner  2005 ). Consequently, the risk manifests itself 
</p>
<p>upstream in potential or actual supply chain disturbances (Peck et al.  2003 ) 
</p>
<p>caused by variability in the availability of materials, lead times, delivery prob-
</p>
<p>lems, industrial action, or reliability of a supplier (Waters  2011 ).
</p>
<p>&bull;      Environmental risk sources:  As   environmental risk is associated with disruption 
</p>
<p>external to the focal organization and supply chain network (J&uuml;ttner  2005 ; 
</p>
<p>Peck et al.  2003 ; Christopher and Peck  2004 ), it represents a level of risk that is 
</p>
<p>often beyond the direct control of supply chain operators (Peck  2005 ). Factors 
</p>
<p>infl uencing the level of environmental risk can be summarized as political, 
</p>
<p> environmental, social, technological, economic, or legal aspects (PESTEL).

</p>
<p> Other categorizations of sources of risk, rather than organizational, network, and 
</p>
<p> environmental   are also reported in the literature (see Table  19.1 ). Whatever catego-
</p>
<p>rization one prefers, identifying risks related to such categories is critical so that 
</p>
<p>consequences can be understood and assessed (Tummala and Schoenherr  2011 ).

</p>
<p>There are many methods for the identifi cation of specifi c risks (Norrman and 
</p>
<p>Jansson  2004 ). &ldquo;Five whys,&rdquo; cause-and-effect diagrams, Pareto analysis, checklists, 
</p>
<p>interviews, process charts and controls supply chain even management and supply 
</p>
<p>chain risk mapping (for further details see Waters  2011 ), are only some of the meth-
</p>
<p>ods that can be used by managers to identify possible risk sources. Care needs to be 
</p>
<p>taken in the identifi cation as risk sources can never be seen in isolation: they are 
</p>
<p>linked to each other in complex patterns with one risk source leading to another, or 
</p>
<p>infl uencing the outcome of other risks (Manuj and Mentzer  2008b ; Miller  1992 ) 
</p>
<p>e.g., environmental risks can cause supply or demand risks (J&uuml;ttner  2005 ; Manuj 
</p>
<p>and Mentzer  2008a ). Furthermore, as a result of complex supply chain designs, 
</p>
<p>there is the risk of additional chaos resulting from overreactions, unnecessary inter-
</p>
<p>ventions, second guessing, mistrust, and distorted information throughout the sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain (Christopher and Lee  2004 ) which could potentially lead to e.g., the 
</p>
<p>bullwhip effect (for further details see Lee et al.  1997 ).
</p>
<p>   Irrespective of the source of the risk, the profi le and nature of risk can be highly 
</p>
<p>divergent: the fi nancial default of a supplier (network risk) and a natural disaster 
</p>
<p>destroying production capacity (environmental risk) are situations with completely 
</p>
<p>different attributes in terms of incubation period, probability, predictability, and 
</p>
<p>severity (Wagner and Bode  2006 ). As such, classifying risks into categories simply 
</p>
<p>indicates the source of the risks and does not indicate the nature, scale, or manage-
</p>
<p>ability (Ritchie and Brindley  2007b ). Hence, the identifi cation and classifi cation of 
</p>
<p>risk sources on its own is meaningless as each risk effects the supply chain differ-
</p>
<p>ently; at the same time, risk identifi cation is of great importance (J&uuml;ttner et al.  2003 ) 
</p>
<p>providing the basis for risk quantifi cation, assessment, and evaluation that can be 
</p>
<p>used in deriving risk mitigation strategies (Narasimhan and Talluri  2009 ). This will 
</p>
<p>be further discussed in the following section.  
</p>
<p>19.4     Risk Assessment and Analysis 
</p>
<p> The main focus  of   supply chain risk assessment is to recognize and analyze future 
</p>
<p>uncertainties to enable proactive management of risk-related issues (Norrman and 
</p>
<p>Jansson  2004 ). This involves the determination of the consequences of all identi-
</p>
<p>fi ed, potential supply chain risks, together with their magnitudes of impact (Tummala 
</p>
<p>and Schoenherr  2011 ). Impact refers to the signifi cance of the loss to the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion and/or supply chain(s) (Zsidisin et al.  2004 ). Adverse risk consequences can 
</p>
<p>become manifested in any outcome measure such as loss of or damage to assets, 
</p>
<p>income, service levels, or schedules. Supply chain design characteristics such as 
</p>
<p>density, complexity, and node critically have been shown to increase the severity of 
</p>
<p>possible risks (Craighead et al.  2007 ). Some further examples have been given in 
</p>
<p>the introduction already. Accordingly, supply chain risk assessment should be a 
</p>
<p>formal part of the decision-making process at every level from product design to 
</p>
<p>component availability and lead time determination (Christopher and Peck  2004 ). 
</p>
<p>19 Risk and Uncertainty Management for Sustainable Supply Chains</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>420
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the consequences of risk do not necessarily need to be negative as the 
</p>
<p>essence of risk-taking is the potential opportunity to produce positive outcomes 
</p>
<p>(Ritchie and Brindley  2007a ) although in the context of this chapter, we defi ne risk 
</p>
<p>outcomes as negative. 
</p>
<p> In addition to the severity and impact, organizations need to understand that sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain disruptions can be frequent or infrequent and short- or long-term (Chopra 
</p>
<p>and Sodhi  2004 ). Risk is perceived to exist if there is a relatively high likelihood 
</p>
<p>that an event occurs and that the event has a signifi cant associated impact or cost 
</p>
<p>(Zsidisin et al.  2004 ). Therefore, as some risks will have severe consequences and 
</p>
<p>others not, it is important for organization to assess the probability of the risk 
</p>
<p>occurrences alongside the possible impact (Cohen and Kunreuther  2007 ). The like-
</p>
<p>lihood of occurrence, typically expressed as a probability, can be articulated in 
</p>
<p>objective (absolute values) or subjective terms (ranges) (Ritchie and Brindley 
</p>
<p> 2007a ). In this context, probability is a measure of the likelihood of occurrence of 
</p>
<p>a negative event. 
</p>
<p> Combining the assessment of impact (consequences) and probability allows 
</p>
<p>organizations to classify their supply chain vulnerability as shown in Fig.  19.3 . 
</p>
<p>This is calculated by multiplying the value of the impact of risk by its probability 
</p>
<p>of occurrence (giving the expected value of the impact) or by Monte Carlo simula-
</p>
<p>tion, scenario analysis, failure modes, and effects analysis or network models 
</p>
<p>(Waters  2011 ). The most important consideration for a risk manager is to have an 
</p>
<p>advanced plan that indicates a suitable response to any possible event (Spekman 
</p>
<p>and Davis  2004 ) that has fi rst been identifi ed and then quantifi ed as shown in the 
</p>
<p>section via considerations of impact and probability (vulnerability). Hence, fol-
</p>
<p>lowing these steps in the risk management process,    different possible risk manage-
</p>
<p>ment strategies need to be considered to derive at a decision of what to do. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, in the next section, we will describe possible risk management 
</p>
<p>strategies.

</p>
<p>19.5        Risk Management Strategies 
</p>
<p> While it is impossible  to   completely eliminate risks and consequent vulnerabilities 
</p>
<p>from a supply chain, they can be reduced if an organization is proactive and pre-
</p>
<p>pared (Faisal et al.  2006 ). Risk management is the process in which decisions are 
</p>
<p>made to accept a known or assessed risk and strategies are developed that reduce the 
</p>
<p>probabilities and impact of negative events and/or their consequences in case they 
</p>
<p>occur (Cohen and Kunreuther  2007 ; Manuj and Mentzer  2008b ). Depending on the 
</p>
<p>assessment of risks, different strategies can be deployed to manage the risks: risk 
</p>
<p>reduction or mitigation, risk avoidance, risk-taking or acceptance and risk sharing 
</p>
<p>or transfer (Norrman and Jansson  2004 ) (see Fig.  19.4 ). There is no one best strat-
</p>
<p>egy for protecting supply chains against risks, instead, managers need to know 
</p>
<p>which strategy works best against which given risk (Chopra and Sodhi  2004 ).
</p>
<p>   Notwithstanding the level of vulnerability, managers have two choices, either 
</p>
<p>they can ignore (or accept) the risk and do nothing, or they can respond and do 
</p>
<p>something (Waters  2011 ). Since it is not feasible nor practical to develop mitiga-
</p>
<p>tion and sharing/transfer strategies for every risk identifi ed, risk management 
</p>
<p>begins with the examination of the costs required to implement each preventative 
</p>
<p>action to contain and manage the identifi ed supply chain risks (Tummala and 
</p>
<p>Schoenherr  2011 ). Often a cost-benefi t analysis of low-probability low-impact 
</p>
<p>risks shows that the cost to mitigate the risk is higher than the cost to bear the risk; 
</p>
<p>e.g., in the case of a stationery supply chain for a food processing company, the risk 
</p>
<p>to the stationery supply chain can be accepted without further action, but needs to 
</p>
<p>be monitored closely to ensure that the impact remains low in case the risk should 
</p>
<p>manifest itself in a disruption. 
</p>
<p> Companies typically focus on managing risks with the greatest impact and the 
</p>
<p>greatest probability. Accordingly, Kleindorfer and Saad ( 2005 ) suggest that  risk 
</p>
<p>avoidance , the strategy used for high-probability high-impact risks, should pre-
</p>
<p>cede risk reduction and mitigation. An avoidance strategy is used when the risks

</p>
<p>associated with operating in a given market (environmental risk) or working with 
</p>
<p>particular suppliers or customers (network risk) is considered unacceptable (Manuj 
</p>
<p>and Mentzer  2008a ). To avoid is to eliminate the types of event that could trigger 
</p>
<p>the risk by either driving overall probabilities associated with risk events to zero or 
</p>
<p>by reducing the frequency and probability of a risk (Manuj and Mentzer  2008b ). 
</p>
<p>Being attacked by pirates for example is a high risk for cargo ship operators in 
</p>
<p>some parts of the world; to reduce the risk other routes that avoid the most danger-
</p>
<p>ous seas that can be used (Waters  2011 ).  Another   option for an organization is to 
</p>
<p>drop specifi c products, suppliers, or geographical markets if supply is seen to be 
</p>
<p>highly vulnerable (J&uuml;ttner et al.  2003 ). 
</p>
<p> Similarly,  risk reduction and mitigation , aim to reduce both the probability and 
</p>
<p>consequence of the possible risk event (Manuj and Mentzer  2008b ). Mitigation tac-
</p>
<p>tics are those by which an organization takes some action in advance of a disruption 
</p>
<p>(Tomlin  2006 ) with the aim of achieving robustness. Table  19.2  gives an overview 
</p>
<p>of risk management strategies that aim to achieve robustness for supply network 
</p>
<p>risks rather than organizational risks only (for further details on each strategy see 
</p>
<p>Tang  2006 ). Furthermore, information sharing, aligning incentives, risk sharing, 
</p>
<p>and corporate social responsibility are required to successfully implement risk 
</p>
<p> mitigation strategies (Chopra and Sodhi  2004 ; Faisal et al.  2006 ; Spekman and 
</p>
<p>Davis  2004 ).
</p>
<p>   As illustrated in Table  19.2 , supply chain risk mitigation strategies can be benefi -
</p>
<p>cial under normal circumstances as well as during a major disruption (Tang  2006 ).

</p>
<p>However, at the same time, they can create challenges: every decision that mitigates 
</p>
<p>one risk can end up intensifying another (Chopra and Sodhi  2004 ). As slack is taken 
</p>
<p>out of supply chains with the aim to reduce costs, the chance that events in one link 
</p>
<p>will affect other links considerably increases. Hence, typical supply chain risk man-
</p>
<p>agement solutions such as the maintenance of buffer stocks, built in slack in deliv-
</p>
<p>ery lead times, excess profi t margins to cover returns are becoming less viable in a 
</p>
<p>world of outsourcing, just in time (JIT) and materials requirement planning (MRP). 
</p>
<p>As a result, trade-offs between the robustness (benefi t) of a supply chain to disrup-
</p>
<p>tions and the overall effi ciency (cost) of the supply chain under normal operations 
</p>
<p>have to be made. (Kleindorfer and Saad  2005 ). For example, having additional 
</p>
<p>inventory that might buffer a supply failure can at the same time signifi cantly 
</p>
<p>increase inventory holding costs and in some cases risk of obsolescence. 
</p>
<p>  Risk sharing or transfer  move some of the risks from one organization in the 
</p>
<p>supply chain to another (typically more able or willing to handle it) (Waters  2011 ) 
</p>
<p>via outsourcing, offshoring, or contracting (Manuj and Mentzer  2008a ). Risk could 
</p>
<p>for example be transferred to insurance companies or supply chain partners by mov-
</p>
<p>ing inventory liability, changing delivery times of suppliers (just-in-time deliveries), 
</p>
<p>dealing with customer uncertainty (make-to-order manufacturing), or by deciding 
</p>
<p>to move a part of the production to an outside party (Manuj and Mentzer  2008b ). 
</p>
<p>However, sharing or transferring risk neither eliminates nor reduces the probability 
</p>
<p>or impact of a possible risk event. So while insurance can cover the costs of disrup-
</p>
<p>tion, the disruption nonetheless can occur. 
</p>
<p> Generally, organizations  take   decisions and plan to protect themselves against 
</p>
<p>recurrent, low-impact risks in their supply chains by making use of one of the strate-
</p>
<p>gies above but ignore high-impact, low-likelihood ones (Faisal et al.  2006 ) simply 
</p>
<p>because of the low probability of occurrence (Waters  2011 ). Yet the exacerbating 
</p>
<p>frequency, magnitude, and impact of disasters present an increasing threat to the 
</p>
<p>sustainability of communities, supply chains, businesses, and their resources. The 
</p>
<p>impact of local or regional events can transcend globally: for example, the earth-
</p>
<p>quake in Japan 2012 not only affected the Japanese and Asian economies but led to 
</p>
<p>shortages in the automobile and technology industry globally. However, such low 
</p>
<p>probability supply chain disruptions are hard to identify, hence cannot be assessed 
</p>
<p>and analyzed which limits the possibilities of deriving risk management strategies 
</p>
<p>and decisions. Hence, they cannot be managed via the risk management process so 
</p>
<p>far; they have to be managed in a different way. In the following section, we exam-
</p>
<p>ine how to manage the unknown: supply chain uncertainty. We will do so by refl ect-
</p>
<p>ing on practices from  an   extreme case context: humanitarian disaster management.  
</p>
<p>19.6     Supply Chain Uncertainty Management via Resilience 
</p>
<p> Uncertainty management is no longer about if, but when a disruption is going to 
</p>
<p>happen. In its extreme form, uncertainty relates to the situation in which there is a 
</p>
<p>total absence of information, knowledge, understanding, or awareness of a potential

</p>
<p>event occurrence (Ritchie and Brindley  2007a ). Hence, it is diffi cult if not impossible 
</p>
<p>to follow the risk management process from risk identifi cation to risk assessment 
</p>
<p>and management. By accepting that not all risks can be foreseen, controlled, or 
</p>
<p>eliminated (J&uuml;ttner and Maklan  2011 ) supply chain resilience enhances the tradi-
</p>
<p>tional risk management process as it enables an organization to deal with uncertain 
</p>
<p>factors that can only be identifi ed and predicted to a limited extent (Scholten and 
</p>
<p>Schilder  2015 ). Whereas risk management tries to decrease the vulnerability (prob-
</p>
<p>ability and impact) of a certain risk, resilience focuses on the ability to absorb the 
</p>
<p>impact of a disturbance that might stem from any risk by enabling the supply chain 
</p>
<p>to return to stable conditions faster (Peck  2005 ). The aim is not to analyze risks and 
</p>
<p>fi nd the best strategy to respond, but to consider each part of the supply chain, see 
</p>
<p>what happens when the part is disrupted and set up mechanisms that enable quick 
</p>
<p>recovery of operations (Waters  2011 ). 
</p>
<p>  Resilience   has been defi ned in supply chain terms as &ldquo;the adaptive capability of 
</p>
<p>the supply chain to prepare for unexpected events, respond to disruption and recover 
</p>
<p>from them by maintaining continuity of operations at the desired level of connect-
</p>
<p>edness and control over structures and function&rdquo; (Ponomarov and Holcomb 
</p>
<p> 2009 :131). An often-cited example in the context of supply chain resilience is a fi re 
</p>
<p>at a Philips Electronics plant in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March 2000 which 
</p>
<p>simultaneously affected Nokia and Ericsson (see e.g., Norrman and Jansson  2004 ; 
</p>
<p>Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ), who accounted for 40 % of the plant&rsquo;s shipments (Mukherjee 
</p>
<p> 2008 ). Both competitors were solely dependent on Philips for the chips they pro-
</p>
<p>duced (Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ). The two companies reacted differently to the supply 
</p>
<p>chain disruptions. Nokia was better able to deal with the disruption than Ericsson, 
</p>
<p>displaying the adaptive capabilities that allowed the organization to quickly dis-
</p>
<p>cover and effi ciently recover from the disruptive event (Blackhurst et al.  2011 ; Pettit 
</p>
<p>et al.  2010 ). Ericsson on the other hand, had to quit the mobile-phone business as a 
</p>
<p>result of the disruption, leaving Nokia to reinforce its position as the European mar-
</p>
<p>ket leader. But what made the adaptive capability of Nokia better than the one of 
</p>
<p>Ericsson? 
</p>
<p> While there are few conceptual differences in how supply chain resilience is 
</p>
<p>defi ned (see e.g., Brandon-Jones et al.  2014 ; Peck et al.  2003 ; Ponomarov and 
</p>
<p>Holcomb  2009 ; Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ) the formative elements needed to secure the 
</p>
<p>adaptive capability of resilience are presented with signifi cant disparity in literature 
</p>
<p>(J&uuml;ttner and Maklan  2011 ; Scholten et al.  2014 ).  Formative elements   of the adap-
</p>
<p>tive capabilities of a supply chain have, for example, been conceptualized as col-
</p>
<p>laboration, supply chain design principles, risk awareness, visibility, fl exibility, 
</p>
<p>security and velocity (Blackhurst et al.  2011 ; Christopher and Peck  2004 ; J&uuml;ttner 
</p>
<p>and Maklan  2011 ; Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ) - see Table  19.3   for   an overview. On their 
</p>
<p>own, all of these elements display good SCM practices based on integrating and 
</p>
<p>coordinating resources (J&uuml;ttner and Maklan  2011 ). The example of Nokia and 
</p>
<p>Ericsson further illustrates this: Nokia acted quickly after hearing about the fi re and 
</p>
<p>moved to tie up spare capacity at other Philips plants and every other supplier they 
</p>
<p>could fi nd (Mukherjee  2008 ). The company sent 30 employees to work with Philips 
</p>
<p>and other suppliers to restore supply (Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ). Furthermore, they

<p>changed some of the product specifi cations so that they could take chips from other 
</p>
<p>Japanese and American suppliers (Mukherjee  2008 ). The company&rsquo;s culture (risk 
</p>
<p>awareness) together with the deep relationships with suppliers (collaboration) 
</p>
<p>enabled the  company to recognize the severity of the situation quickly (visibility 
</p>
<p>and velocity), disseminate the news and take immediate action at various levels of 
</p>
<p>the organization (agility and knowledge management) (Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ). 
</p>
<p>Hence, they displayed all system level adaptive supply chain resilience capabilities: 
</p>
<p>supply chain re- engineering, collaboration, agility, risk awareness and knowledge 
</p>
<p>management. Therefore, Nokia had the adaptive capabilities that supported its sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain to overcome the disruption by continually adapting and altering itself to 
</p>
<p>meet required changes, that would let the company deal with the situation (Scholten 
</p>
<p>et al.  2014 ).
</p>
<p>   Ericsson on the other hand was not proactive and did not realize the seriousness 
</p>
<p>of the disruption until weeks later (Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ). It took too long before 
</p>
<p>higher management was aware of the incident and the company had neither alterna-
</p>
<p>tive sources of supply nor was it prepared for this kind of accident (Mukherjee 
</p>
<p> 2008 ). In fact, by the time Ericsson took action for recovery, the worldwide supply 
</p>
<p>of the chips in question, was committed to Nokia (Sheffi  and Rice  2005 ). Ericsson 
</p>
<p>employed sharing and transfer of risk via insurance: business interruption costs 
</p>
<p>were calculated and compensated as approximately $200 million (Norrman and 
</p>
<p>Jansson  2004 ). However, the insurance was not able to eliminate the consequences 
</p>
<p>of the manifested risk. As Waters ( 2011 ) argues, low probability high-impact risks 
</p>
<p>should not be managed with regular supply chain risk management tools and strate-
</p>
<p>gies. Instead, holistic mechanisms considering the system level adaptive supply 
</p>
<p>chain resilience capabilities of supply chain re-engineering, collaboration, agility, 
</p>
<p>risk awareness and knowledge management need to be put in place. Hence, the inci-
</p>
<p>dent made Ericsson realize the importance of not only understanding and managing 
</p>
<p>risks internally&mdash;but also trying to manage  uncertainty  along the supply chain 
</p>
<p>(Norrman and Jansson  2004 ) in a way that operations can continue during any 
</p>
<p>emergency. 
</p>
<p> While the importance of uncertainty management is evident in both theory and 
</p>
<p>practice, the literature has moved little beyond basic  conceptual frameworks   to 
</p>
<p>assess the resilience of a  supply chain  rather than a single organization (Blackhurst 
</p>
<p>et al.  2011 ; J&uuml;ttner and Maklan  2011 ; Pettit et al.  2013 ). Hence, there is hardly any 
</p>
<p>management guidance on the implementation and operationalization of the concept 
</p>
<p>of supply chain resilience (Scholten et al.  2014 ). Recent supply chain studies sug-
</p>
<p>gest that commercial supply chain operations can benefi t from research into disaster 
</p>
<p>SCM (Christopher and Tatham  2011 ) especially in relation to risk and uncertainty 
</p>
<p>management practices (Day et al.  2012 ): private sector businesses can learn about 
</p>
<p>vulnerability assessment, preparation, and response to disasters from humanitarian 
</p>
<p>organizations (Van Wassenhove  2006 ). As breakdowns and interruptions in material 
</p>
<p>and information fl ow (Blecken  2010 ) occur frequently in emergency situations, 
</p>
<p>organizations that are active in disaster management are experts in working with 
</p>
<p>uncertainty and risk - for them experiencing unpredictability is the norm (Scholten 
</p>
<p>et al.  2014 ). As such, the disaster management sector has the potential to create a 
</p>
<p>19 Risk and Uncertainty Management for Sustainable Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>428
</p>
<p>hothouse of information for risk and uncertainty management practices in addition 
</p>
<p>to the traditional practices described in this chapter so far, thereby providing critical 
</p>
<p>insights applicable to private sector SCM. This has been shown by recent research 
</p>
<p>from Scholten et al. ( 2014 ) and will be further outlined in the following section.  
</p>
<p>19.7     Disaster Management 
</p>
<p> The disaster management context represents an ideal opportunity to examine supply 
</p>
<p>chain risk and uncertainty given the exacerbating frequency, magnitude, and impact 
</p>
<p>of disasters threatening the sustainability of communities, businesses, and their 
</p>
<p>resources around the globe (Scholten et al.  2014 ). Disasters seriously disrupt the 
</p>
<p>functioning of society, and cause widespread human, material, or environmental 
</p>
<p>loss or damage, which is often of such magnitude that the affected areas cannot rely 
</p>
<p>just on their own resources to manage their situations (United Nations  1992 ). Hence, 
</p>
<p>they test the resilience of affected local supply networks which integrate govern-
</p>
<p>ment agencies, non-governmental organizations, for-profi t organizations, the mili-
</p>
<p>tary and community organizations into relief efforts (Day  2014 ). The aim of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian relief is to quickly provide  assistance and alleviate suffering   either 
</p>
<p>long term or during and after a disaster in affected areas with the aim of saving and 
</p>
<p>sustaining lives as well as (re)creating self-suffi ciency (Th&eacute;venaz and Resodihardjo 
</p>
<p> 2010 ). According to van Wassenhove ( 2006 ) SCM is a  crucial function   in disaster 
</p>
<p>management for the following reasons:
</p>
<p>&bull;    The performance of relief operations in terms of effectiveness and speed of cur-
</p>
<p>rent and future operations and programs.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Serving as a bridge between disaster preparedness and response, between pro-
</p>
<p>curement and distribution and between headquarters and the fi eld.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Providing a rich source of data in terms of tracking of goods, which could be 
</p>
<p>used to analyze post-event effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Representing 80 % of relief operations (and their costs) and therefore being the 
</p>
<p>element that can make the difference between a successful or failed operation.    
</p>
<p> Both private sector and disaster, not-for-profi t SCM not only have a lot in com-
</p>
<p>mon (Ernst  2003 ), but humanitarian supply chains may be somewhat commercial in 
</p>
<p>the way that private sector companies might undertake production and some of the 
</p>
<p>transport and logistical activities (Jahre et al.  2009 ). However, at the same time dis-
</p>
<p>aster relief chain management differs on various levels (Beamon and Balcik  2008 ) 
</p>
<p>as  shown   in Table  19.4 . As a result of the unpredictability and uncertainties around 
</p>
<p>disasters, humanitarian relief operations are faced with unique characteristics: zero 
</p>
<p>lead times affecting inventory, procurement and distribution, high stakes at risk, 
</p>
<p>unreliable supply and transportation information (Beamon  2004 ).
</p>
<p>   While nobody can identify exactly when or where a low-probability high-impact 
</p>
<p>disaster, such as an earthquake or tsunami, is going to happen, identifying vulnera-
</p>
<p>ble areas that are at risk (Peck  2005 ,  2006 ) creates opportunities to put in place 
</p>
<p>K. Scholten and B. Fynes</p>

<p>429
</p>
<p>practices and resources that minimize the impact of disasters before they occur 
</p>
<p>(Dilley  2006 ; Scholten et al.  2014 ). This echoes similarities to the  traditional risk 
</p>
<p>management process   described earlier. However, sustainable relief operations and 
</p>
<p>their management involve a continuum of interlinked activities (Pettit and Beresford 
</p>
<p> 2005 ) across the four disaster phases: preparedness, immediate response, recovery, 
</p>
<p>and mitigation. The disaster management cycle depicted in Fig.  19.5  indicates that 
</p>
<p>effective and effi cient disaster management is about the  application   of a strategic 
</p>
<p>focus to the processes of making  proactive  decisions to lessen disaster impact (dur-
</p>
<p>ing mitigation and preparation) and  reactive  decisions in overcoming the impact 
</p>
<p>(during response and recovery) (Natarajarathinam et al.  2009 ) comparable to defi ni-
</p>
<p>tions of supply chain resilience in academic research:
</p>
<p>&bull;       Mitigation    concerns the application of measures that will either prevent the onset 
</p>
<p>of a disaster or reduce the impact should one occur (Altay and Green  2006 ; 
</p>
<p>Tomlin  2006 ).  
</p>
<p>&bull;     Preparedness    includes activities that prepare for an effective and effi cient 
</p>
<p>response (Altay and Green  2006 ; Tomlin  2006 ).  
</p>
<p>&bull;     Response    processes include the employment of resources to preserve life, prop-
</p>
<p>erty, the environment, and the social, economic, and political structures (Altay 
</p>
<p>and Green  2006 ).

</p>
<p>&bull;   During   recovery   , actions are taken in the long term after the immediate impact 
</p>
<p>has passed to stabilize and restore some semblance of normalcy in structures 
</p>
<p>(Altay and Green  2006 ).    
</p>
<p> As with the Ponomarov and Holcomb&rsquo;s ( 2009 ) defi nition of supply chain resil-
</p>
<p>ience, resilience in the context of humanitarian aid has been defi ned as &ldquo;a process 
</p>
<p>linking a set of adaptive capabilities to a positive trajectory of functioning and adap-
</p>
<p>tation after a disturbance&rdquo; (Norris et al.  2008 :130). In an empirical study, Scholten 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2014 ) establish a link between the conceptual supply chain resilience adaptive 
</p>
<p>capabilities and practical disaster management processes part of the disaster man-
</p>
<p>agement cycle (Fig.  19.5 ). The  results   depicted in Fig.  19.6  show that mitigation 
</p>
<p>processes are of paramount importance as they are the antecedents to building sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain resilience capabilities which in turn enable the execution of the necessary 
</p>
<p>processes during preparedness, response, and recovery. The authors emphasize that 
</p>
<p>there is no &ldquo;one-size-fi ts-all&rdquo; model for supply chain resilience as each organization 
</p>
<p>will have idiosyncratic requirements (van Vactor  2011 ) in terms of time, human, 
</p>
<p>physical, and organizational resources. Christopher and Peck ( 2004 ) highlight that 
</p>
<p>determining the appropriate practices to manage supply chain vulnerabilities and 
</p>
<p>risk appears to be context-specifi c, dependent amongst other things on the supply 
</p>
<p>chain&rsquo;s response to the need for operational excellence. Hence, the framework by 
</p>
<p>Scholten et al. ( 2014 ) depicted in Fig.  19.6  is not to be seen as a specifi c defi ned 
</p>
<p>route to supply chain resilience but more as a road map that can guide individual,

</p>
<p>some of the bigger humanitarian organizations&rsquo; senior management has recognized 
</p>
<p>the importance of SCM to the performance of relief operations. Nevertheless, things 
</p>
<p>are often different in the fi eld. Even where proven SCM practices and strategies are 
</p>
<p>used, acceptable response and recovery performance has remained elusive (Day 
</p>
<p> 2014 ). The pipeline of publications in general SCM journals on humanitarian aid, 
</p>
<p>and the establishment of a specialized journal demonstrate the growing acknowl-
</p>
<p>edgement of the value, importance, and potential of this research fi eld. Nevertheless, 
</p>
<p>advancements in humanitarian SCM remain necessary for the prompt alleviation of 
</p>
<p>a disaster&rsquo;s impact and overall sustainable operations: &ldquo;What is lacking, is a body 
</p>
<p>of theory that can help explain why some approaches manage to create effective 
</p>
<p>disaster supply chains, whereas so many disasters suffer the lack of effective disas-
</p>
<p>ter supply chains&rdquo; (Boin et al.  2010 :4). This highlights the possibilities for cross 
</p>
<p>learning between commercial and disaster management organizations: commercial 
</p>
<p>companies can learn about supply chain risk and resilience management from disas-
</p>
<p>ter management organizations (effectiveness) while at the same time passing on 
</p>
<p>their general knowledge on supply chain management (effectiveness and effi -
</p>
<p>ciency). Balaisyte et al. ( 2017 ) discuss such cross-sector partnerships in more detail 
</p>
<p>in Chap.   22    .  
</p>
<p>19.8     Conclusion 
</p>
<p> Today more than ever, managers need to be aware of risk and uncertainty that might 
</p>
<p>negatively impact the organizational sustainability due to suboptimal supply chain 
</p>
<p>performance. Adopting supply chain risk management practices cannot only yield 
</p>
<p>continuous improvement of supply chain operations (Elkins et al.  2005 ), but also be 
</p>
<p>the key to business survival and sustainability. While there is a large body of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and research on risk management and how to try and prevent supply chain 
</p>
<p>disruptions via the supply, chain risk management process (identifi cation, assess-
</p>
<p>ment and analysis, strategies and decisions), in today&rsquo;s global and complex world it 
</p>
<p>is not a question of if a disruption is going to happen but when. Therefore, we need 
</p>
<p>to know how they can be dealt with in an effective and effi cient way. Yet, research 
</p>
<p>on supply chain resilience, a concept that extends supply chain risk management to 
</p>
<p>deal with uncertainties, is for a large part conceptual; more empirical research and 
</p>
<p>practical insights, particularly beyond a single company perspective, are required to 
</p>
<p>help organizations and their supply chains to become more sustainable. 
</p>
<p> One area for potential insights on supply chain resilience is the humanitarian aid 
</p>
<p>sector. On the one hand, humanitarian SCM, while particularly rich and exciting, 
</p>
<p>could be treated as just another research context for applying theories developed in 
</p>
<p>the mainstream commercial SCM. On the other hand, this approach overlooks the 
</p>
<p>potential opportunities for reverse learning as the dynamic and unpredictable envi-
</p>
<p>ronment of humanitarian SCM may provide unique insights for building main-
</p>
<p>stream theory. Humanitarian SCM shows many similarities and faces many of the 
</p>
<p>challenges of commercial SCM, except in a more extreme context. Existing research

<p>20.1          Introduction: Social and Environmental Problems 
</p>
<p>in Global Supply Chains 
</p>
<p> In his best seller,  The World Is Flat: a brief history of the twenty-fi rst century,  
</p>
<p>T.L. Friedman ( 2005 ) described how emerging  economies   like China and India have 
</p>
<p>risen as major manufacturing and service centers for the global economy. Over the 
</p>
<p>last few decades, as production shifted from the West to emerging economies, 
</p>
<p>global enterprises were able to leverage cost and other advantages which out-
</p>
<p>weighed factors such as loss of control, increases in lead time, inventory, and other 
</p>
<p>risks. This  globalization   of production has delivered benefi ts to corporations and to 
</p>
<p>consumers in the form of more affordable products and services. 
</p>
<p> However, with these benefi ts have come signifi cant costs. O&rsquo;Rourke ( 2014 ) 
</p>
<p>highlights the fact that current levels of global production and consumption are 
</p>
<p>using 50 % more natural resources and services than ecosystems generate. Weaker 
</p>
<p>law enforcement, corruption, cultural, and other factors in developing countries 
</p>
<p>have led to myriad social, environmental, and ethical problems at factories which 
</p>
<p>directly or indirectly supply goods and services (called suppliers in this chapter) to 
</p>
<p>global corporations (called buyers in this chapter). When factory workers exceed 
</p>
<p>working hour limits and incur excessive overtime, their health can be impacted 
</p>
<p>along with product quality. Excessive factory carbon emissions have climate 
</p>
<p>impacts, and ethical breakdowns such as intellectual property theft can affect com-
</p>
<p>pany sales. In addition to the obvious human and environmental costs associated 
</p>
<p>with these problems, such issues can impact both the reputation and profi ts of 
</p>
<p>global brands.

</p>
<p> To combat the social, environmental, and ethical problems in global supply 
</p>
<p>chains, governments have increased the level of regulation placed on buyers and 
</p>
<p>suppliers (Westervelt  2012 ). Consumers, activists, and investors are also increas-
</p>
<p>ingly vocal about improving supplier responsibility. This has caused global fi rms to 
</p>
<p>pay closer attention to the issue, and, in many cases, use  self-regulation   such as 
</p>
<p>supplier codes of conduct to compensate for weak law enforcement. 
</p>
<p> Despite the push for multinational corporations to develop and enforce sup-
</p>
<p>plier codes of conduct to address employee safety, labor, and environmental issues 
</p>
<p>at their suppliers, violations of these codes of conduct remain problematic in 
</p>
<p>many industries, and vary in nature. The tragic collapse of the apparel factory 
</p>
<p>building, Rana Plaza in Bangladesh in April 2013, killing over 1000 people, is an 
</p>
<p>example of a major lapse in building safety codes. The building housed suppliers 
</p>
<p>for apparel brands including Benetton, Walmart, Matalan, and Primark. The prob-
</p>
<p>lem of excessive overtime in factories is widespread with 90 % of factories audited 
</p>
<p>by the  Fair Labor Association   in 2011 committing overtime violations ( 2011  FLA 
</p>
<p>Annual Report). It is estimated that 21 million workers are trapped in modern 
</p>
<p>slavery, many of whom are part of global supply chains (Economist  2015 ). On the 
</p>
<p>environmental side, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a promi-
</p>
<p>nent NGO which maintains an air and water pollution database of factory environ-
</p>
<p>mental violations in China, recorded over 100,000 violations between 2006 and 
</p>
<p>2012. It made public evidence that suppliers of world-renowned brands such as 
</p>
<p>Apple (Mozur and Dou  2013 ) and Marks &amp; Spencer (IPE  2012 ) polluted rivers 
</p>
<p>and air in China. 
</p>
<p> Buyers have many motivations for improving supply chain responsibility, includ-
</p>
<p>ing adherence to regulations, avoidance of supply side disruptions (e.g., a factory 
</p>
<p>closure resulting from a health and safety violation), negative media coverage, and 
</p>
<p>pressure from external stakeholders (Cousins et al.  2004 ; Newman and Breeden 
</p>
<p> 1992 ). Additionally, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of and concerned 
</p>
<p>about responsible supply chain practices, thus infl uencing demand for responsibly 
</p>
<p>made products. Cotte and Trudel ( 2009 ) reviewed 13 studies with consumer 
</p>
<p>willingness- to-pay data, and found an average premium paid for a product manufac-
</p>
<p>tured with sustainable practices is 10 %, and consumers demand a discount for 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;unsustainability.&rdquo; They found consumers willing to pay a premium are more will-
</p>
<p>ing when the premium is small relative to product cost, and that willingness to pay 
</p>
<p>a premium drops off sharply at higher premium levels. 
</p>
<p> Lee et al. ( 2012 ) found that, among 1281 supply chain executives surveyed, 49 % 
</p>
<p>were somewhat or very concerned about unsatisfactory social and environmental 
</p>
<p>standards at suppliers, and the corresponding percentage on breach of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights was at 53 %. An even higher percentage, 58 %, worried about coun-
</p>
<p>terfeit products from the  supply network  . As discussed in Chap.   1    , improving sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain responsibility is not only seen as a way to mitigate a variety of risks and 
</p>
<p>meet regulations, but also as a means to increase profi ts, either by saving costs, 
</p>
<p>growing revenues via brand image, or doing both. 
</p>
<p> Corporations, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, consumers 
</p>
<p>and other groups have made progress in recent years to understand the activities in 
</p>

</p>
<p>global supply chains and implement strategies aimed at making an impact. Still, 
</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Rourke ( 2014 ) calls for better data, decision-support tools, and ultimately 
</p>
<p> incentives to move from policing supply chains to predicting and preventing unsus-
</p>
<p>tainable practices. 
</p>
<p> Research suggests that various supplier management strategies aimed at improv-
</p>
<p>ing social and environmental performance can also improve  economic performance   
</p>
<p>(Rao and Holt  2005 ; Vachon and Klassen  2006 ; Lewis et al.  2012 ; Gimenez and 
</p>
<p>Tachizawa  2012 ). This complements evidence that socially responsible fi rms yield 
</p>
<p>higher returns (Derwall et al.  2005 ) and that social and environmental incidents and 
</p>
<p>noncompliances can lead to subsequent fi nancial losses (Klassen and McLaughlin 
</p>
<p> 1996 ; PwC  2010 ). Rao and Holt ( 2005 ) empirically fi nd signifi cant positive rela-
</p>
<p>tionships between &ldquo;green&rdquo; supply chain management across the entire supply chain 
</p>
<p>and economic performance measures. Wu and Pagell ( 2011 ) fi nd their sample of 
</p>
<p>fi rms maintains business viability while pushing for improved environmental per-
</p>
<p>formance. Cousins et al. ( 2004 ) look at actions that can be taken by a buying fi rm to 
</p>
<p>manage the environmental performance of its suppliers, comparing the resources 
</p>
<p>available and perceived losses from environmental noncompliances. They suggest 
</p>
<p>that incentives and supplier-monitoring schemes typically require more resources 
</p>
<p>but are adopted by proactive companies who wish to gain competitive advantage 
</p>
<p>through improved environmental supply chain performance. 
</p>
<p> Still, debate exists on the link between responsible supplier management prac-
</p>
<p>tices and the resulting economic benefi ts (Corbett and Klassen  2006 ). We will 
</p>
<p>examine the relationship between responsible supplier management practices 
</p>
<p>and social, environmental, and when possible, economic performance using a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;response&rdquo; framework. To do this, we will examine research as well 
</p>
<p>as case studies.  
</p>
<p>20.2     A Framework for Continuous Improvement: Sense 
</p>
<p>and Response 
</p>
<p> Seuring and M&uuml;ller ( 2008 ) defi ne sustainability in supply chain management as the 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;management of material, information, and capital fl ows  as    well   as cooperation 
</p>
<p>among companies along the supply chain while taking goals from all three dimen-
</p>
<p>sions of sustainable management, i.e., economic, environmental, and social into 
</p>
<p>account which are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements.&rdquo; Similarly, 
</p>
<p>in operations management literature, Bowen et al. ( 2001 ) and Handfi eld et al. ( 1997 ) 
</p>
<p>discuss &ldquo;green supply&rdquo; and &ldquo;green value chain practices&rdquo; respectively, &ldquo;which are 
</p>
<p>used to characterize environmental aspects of supplier arrangements; all of these 
</p>
<p>implicitly or explicitly focus on improved environmental performance through bet-
</p>
<p>ter supplier management&rdquo; (Corbett and Klassen  2006 ). 
</p>
<p> A useful guide to address responsible supply chain management is the sense and 
</p>
<p>response framework. Haeckel ( 1992 ) described the sense and response framework 
</p>
<p>20 Improving Social and Environmental Performance in Global Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>442
</p>
<p>as a system for companies to respond to rapidly changing customer needs. In larger 
</p>
<p>fi rms, this can mean that networks of skills, assets, cross-functional processes, infor-
</p>
<p>mation, and knowledge are linked into capabilities, which are in turn linked into 
</p>
<p>processes for creating product and service responses to customer needs. The frame-
</p>
<p>work can be applied to continually evolving social, environmental, and ethical issues 
</p>
<p>in global supply chains, such as human traffi cking, pollution, and intellectual prop-
</p>
<p>erty protection, as argued by Gillai et al. ( 2015 ). Kapoor et al. ( 2005 ) discuss the 
</p>
<p>sense and response model as a management tool for managing risk and unpredict-
</p>
<p>ability in operations. These dimensions mirror the structure adopted by Gimenez and 
</p>
<p>Tachizawa ( 2012 ), who defi ne assessment and collaboration as the two governance 
</p>
<p>structures for management of supplier responsibility, and include a further dimension 
</p>
<p>of managerial and external &ldquo;enablers&rdquo; that infl uence the implementation and success 
</p>
<p>of responsible supply chain practices. A buyer must fi rst gain visibility, or &ldquo;sense,&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>into issues in the supply chain. After understanding the present state by measuring 
</p>
<p>and identifying problems, a buyer can then &ldquo;respond&rdquo; by analyzing the problem and 
</p>
<p>taking action. This process can be repeated for continuous improvement. The frame-
</p>
<p>work mimics [the familiar] Six Sigma management cycle for eliminating defects and 
</p>
<p>minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes (Fig.  20.1 ). 1 
</p>
<p>    Buyers can gain   a &ldquo;sense&rdquo; of activities and impacts on the supply  chain   through 
</p>
<p>practices including:
</p>
<p>&bull;     Traceability  : the ability to trace the points of origin of materials used in a 
</p>
<p>product  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Visibility  : knowledge of social, environmental, and ethical performance of 
</p>
<p>suppliers  
</p>
<p>&bull;    Monitoring  : the action of examining supplier performance    
</p>
<p> Once  buyers   have a &ldquo;sense&rdquo; of the supplier&rsquo;s behavior, there are various ways to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;respond.&rdquo; The following are typical practices commonly used in industry:
</p>
<p>1   Originally based on Motorola&rsquo;s work to eliminate quality defects, the  Six Sigma process  is a 
 management process  used by many companies such as Motorola, GE, and others. For an introduc-
tion to Six Sigma, see Harry and Schroeder  2000 .

<p>&bull;     Reactions to violations   once they have occurred (e.g., root cause analysis, and 
</p>
<p>penalties such as fi nes, supplier warning, reduced business, contract termination)  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Incentives (e.g., preferred supplier status, increased business, price premium)  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Supplier capacity building (e.g., productivity improvement and capability 
</p>
<p>expansion)

<p>&bull;   Proactive product and/or process design (e.g., design for the environment)

</p>
<p>development)  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Cascading responsible practices to the supplier network (e.g., training and moti-
</p>
<p>vating the suppliers to adopt incentives, capacity building,    and design principles 
</p>
<p>to improve the sustainability of their own supply network)     
</p>
<p>20.3     Sense and Respond Practices 
</p>
<p> How can companies improve the sustainability of their supply chain through initia-
</p>
<p>tives in &ldquo;sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;respond&rdquo;? In this section, we describe some such examples. 
</p>
<p>20.3.1     Sense 
</p>
<p>20.3.1.1     Traceability 
</p>
<p> Buyers  cannot   effectively control the sustainability of the supply network if they do 
</p>
<p>not even know exactly where the materials in products come from. Being able to 
</p>
<p>trace the points of origin of materials used in the product is a crucial step in being 
</p>
<p>able to &ldquo;sense&rdquo; the sustainability status of a supply chain. 
</p>
<p> Early in 2008, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. ( 2014 ) faced pressure from external stakehold-
</p>
<p>ers&mdash;media, worker-rights, and environmental nongovernmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>socially responsible investment fi rms and retailers&mdash;about the cotton used in their 
</p>
<p>products, as there were reports that forced child labor had been used to harvest cot-
</p>
<p>ton in Uzbekistan. This prompted the company into action. Tracing the exact origin 
</p>
<p>of a commodity like cotton is diffi cult; the company had to reach out to the textile 
</p>
<p>mills that supply the cotton fabric. Textile suppliers and licensees were informed 
</p>
<p>that, unless there was clear evidence that the use of forced child labor had been 
</p>
<p>eliminated, Uzbek cotton would be forbidden in the production of branded products 
</p>
<p>of Levi Strauss. But, as cotton went through the apparel supply chain, there was 
</p>
<p>little transparency into its country&rsquo;s origins. In order to trace the country of origin of 
</p>
<p>the cotton in their products, the company had to partner with external organizations 
</p>
<p>with expertise in supply chain traceability to implement a tracking system from the 
</p>
<p>level of the yarn spinner to the product manufacturer. This provided confi dence that 
</p>
<p>Uzbek cotton was not being used in the Levi Strauss supply chain. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>the company joined NGOs, the socially responsible investment community, major 
</p>
<p>US apparel and retail trade associations and the US Department of State in engaging 
</p>
<p>the Uzbek government to address the problem. 
</p>
<p>20 Improving Social and Environmental Performance in Global Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>444
</p>
<p> A similar traceability challenge applies to &ldquo;confl ict minerals,&rdquo; such as cassiterite 
</p>
<p>(for tin), wolframite (for tungsten), coltan (for tantalum), and gold ore. These min-
</p>
<p>erals are mined in various regions of the world, and then passed through many 
</p>
<p>intermediaries before they are used by electronic companies to produce consumer 
</p>
<p>electronics such as mobile phones and laptop computers. Many of these minerals 
</p>
<p>are mined in Eastern Congo, a region dominated by confl icts and human rights vio-
</p>
<p>lations. Various international efforts have been made to reduce trading of confl ict 
</p>
<p>resources. A prominent effort is the 2010 Dodd&ndash;Frank Act that requires manufac-
</p>
<p>turers to audit their supply chains and  report   confl ict minerals usage (SEC  2012 ).  
</p>
<p>20.3.1.2     Visibility 
</p>
<p> As discussed above,    traceability refers to knowing which suppliers are providing 
</p>
<p>materials to a fi rm. While knowing a fi rm&rsquo;s supplier is important, it is also critical to 
</p>
<p>understand what those suppliers are doing. Visibility refers to having knowledge of 
</p>
<p>a supplier&rsquo;s sustainability performance. While efforts to gain visibility into the sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain can be associated with improved social and environmental performances 
</p>
<p>(Awaysheh and Klassen  2010 ); it can be a challenge for buyers to obtain this visibil-
</p>
<p>ity. In a survey by Lee et al. ( 2012 ), supply chain executives reported having fairly 
</p>
<p>limited visibility of environmental and social sustainability violations at various 
</p>
<p>levels in the supply network. For example, 39 % of respondents reported having 
</p>
<p>visibility of environmental violations only within internal operations. The percent-
</p>
<p>age declined when considering operations outside of the fi rm, with 28 % of respon-
</p>
<p>dents reporting having visibility of immediate suppliers, and 25 % reporting having 
</p>
<p>visibility of the extended supply network. Finally, 8 % reported having no visibility 
</p>
<p>at all. The degree of visibility on social sustainability violations was similar, as seen 
</p>
<p>in Fig.  20.2 .

</p>
<p>   Gaining visibility of violations or improved sustainability performance requires 
</p>
<p>fi rms to carefully establish mechanisms to detect them. Such mechanisms can 
</p>
<p>include (1) suppliers sharing data with the buyer, which requires a high degree of 
</p>
<p>trust and a collaborative relationship; (2) direct monitoring by buyers, and (3) report-
</p>
<p>ing from interested parties. One example of the latter is the nongovernmental group 
</p>
<p>called the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, or IPE (Shao and Yatsko 
</p>
<p> 2010 ), which uses a vast volunteer network to collect extensive data and report envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental violations throughout China on a public website. Another example of 
</p>
<p>reporting from interested parties is the effort of groups such as Labor Link (Schwartz 
</p>
<p> 2013 ) and Labor Voices (Lahiri  2012 )  which   utilize information technologies such 
</p>
<p>as mobile phones for workers to directly report to global brand violations and infor-
</p>
<p>mation about working conditions, well-being, job satisfaction, and more.  
</p>
<p>20.3.1.3     Monitoring 
</p>
<p> While there  are   myriad regulations in developing countries addressing labor rights, 
</p>
<p>employee health and safety, environmental standards and other issues, there also 
</p>
<p>exists many private sector supply chain interventions which can act as complements 
</p>
<p>or substitutes, depending on the context and factors such as regional governance 
</p>
<p>(Locke et al.  2013 ). Before a buyer enters into a contract with a supplier, there is 
</p>
<p>typically a supplier certifi cation process which involves examining the supplier&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>product quality, ability to deliver the product, pricing, fi nancial status, communica-
</p>
<p>tion capabilities, and other factors. Increasingly, companies are also assessing sup-
</p>
<p>plier social and environmental practices as part of this certifi cation process. Once a 
</p>
<p>contract is established, the supplier may be asked to provide self-assessments of its 
</p>
<p>social and environmental practices. The buyer may also choose to conduct internal 
</p>
<p>audits to verify that the supplier is conforming to the buyer&rsquo;s code of conduct and/
</p>
<p>or contract with a third-party to obtain this assurance. 
</p>
<p> While it is common industry practice to conduct audits to understand a supplier&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>conformance to a code of conduct, research suggests the effectiveness of using 
</p>
<p>audits (a &ldquo;sense&rdquo; tool) alone is limited. In a study of 763 factories that served as 
</p>
<p>suppliers to Nike, Locke et al. ( 2007 ) examined whether audits had affected compli-
</p>
<p>ance ratings of factories between 2001/2002 and 2004/2005. The observation was 
</p>
<p>that about 42 % did not have any rating change despite audits, while more factories 
</p>
<p>had their ratings downgraded. This resulted in the authors calling for  more   proactive 
</p>
<p>actions to make an impact on sustainability.   
</p>
<p>20.3.2     Response 
</p>
<p> Given weak enforcement mechanisms in many developing countries and the fact 
</p>
<p>that monitoring alone can have limited effectiveness, many buyers have adopted 
</p>
<p>additional practices to motivate suppliers to improve social and environmental 
</p>
<p>20 Improving Social and Environmental Performance in Global Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>446
</p>
<p>practices. Some companies use penalties and/or incentives tied to social and envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental performance in supplier contracts (Porteous et al.  2015 ). Some collabo-
</p>
<p>rate with suppliers to increase their awareness of issues and provide them with tools 
</p>
<p>needed to address social and environmental challenges. Another growing practice is 
</p>
<p>to collaborate with various actors in the value chain to create shared value. We 
</p>
<p>examine key response methods and the research regarding their effectiveness below. 
</p>
<p>20.3.2.1     Reactions to Violations 
</p>
<p> Once a  violation   has occurred, buyers can react with consequences such as root 
</p>
<p>cause analysis, and penalties such as fi nes, supplier warning, reduced business, con-
</p>
<p>tract termination. Chen and Lee ( 2015 ) modeled supplier behavior under the prem-
</p>
<p>ise that noncompliance is a result of unexpected and uncertain costs faced by a 
</p>
<p>supplier. The uncertain costs can be due to fl uctuating input material costs, unex-
</p>
<p>pected external disruptions, or internal manufacturing operational problems that 
</p>
<p>may result in more frequent breakdowns or lower yields. Hence, a supplier may 
</p>
<p>engage in noncompliant activities to save money when faced with unexpected and 
</p>
<p>uncertain cost increases that threaten profi ts. The propensity of a supplier to do so 
</p>
<p>is a function of the ethical standard of the supplier, which may or may not act as a 
</p>
<p>deterrent to his/her urge to violate. Accordingly, penalties could discourage viola-
</p>
<p>tions by &ldquo;increasing the stakes&rdquo; to suppliers. One form of monetary penalty is the 
</p>
<p>use of contingencies. A buyer can withhold a portion of payment, which is subject 
</p>
<p>to forfeiture if a supplier violation is found through an audit (the base payment can 
</p>
<p>be paid to the supplier either upfront or at the end of the contract). Alternatively, the 
</p>
<p>withheld payment can also be construed as a bonus, i.e., the supplier would receive 
</p>
<p>an additional payment if no violation is found through an audit. The authors reported 
</p>
<p>that, according to a supplier manual, a major European retailer charged 10 % of 
</p>
<p>order payment as a penalty for any social responsibility audit problems. 
</p>
<p> Lee et al. ( 2012 ) found that companies are becoming increasingly intolerant of 
</p>
<p>sustainability violations. Examples of penalties enacted for violations include mon-
</p>
<p>etary fi nes, reduced business or termination of business relationships (with and 
</p>
<p>without an initial warning). Those surveyed reported that monetary fi nes were not 
</p>
<p>as common as reducing or terminating business relationships. Many companies 
</p>
<p>have a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy for serious issues such  as   child labor, and will termi-
</p>
<p>nate business relationships if such issues are detected (Fig.  20.3 ).
</p>
<p>20.3.2.2        Incentives 
</p>
<p> In contrast  to   penalties, incentives are increasingly being used to motivate suppliers 
</p>
<p>to invest in social and environmental improvements. As we shall see in the case 
</p>
<p>study of Starbucks&rsquo; &ldquo;C.A.F.E. Practices&rdquo; scheme (Lee  2008 ), Starbucks has used 
</p>
<p>positive incentives like preferred supplier status as well as price premiums to reward 
</p>
<p>coffee farmers that achieve high sustainability standards. Motivated by Starbuck&rsquo;s

</p>
<p>&ldquo;C.A.F.E. Practices&rdquo; scheme, Lewis et al. ( 2012 ) show that supply contracts can 
</p>
<p>facilitate the long-term commitment of supply chain partners to collaborate with a 
</p>
<p>fi rm to achieve social and environmental performance. Klassen and McLaughlin 
</p>
<p>( 1996 ) fi nd that public recognition environmental awards and environmental crises 
</p>
<p>for a fi rm can signal good and poor fi nancial performance respectively. 
</p>
<p> Lee et al. ( 2012 ) fi nd that companies have used various incentive schemes to 
</p>
<p>induce suppliers to be sustainable. Very few companies used price premiums as a 
</p>
<p>reward. Instead, giving suppliers special status, increased businesses, recognition 
</p>
<p>and better terms and conditions are more commonly used. Of these companies, 
</p>
<p>42 % also invested in training and education of suppliers (Fig.  20.4 ).
</p>
<p>20.3.2.3        Supplier Collaboration and Capacity Building 
</p>
<p> Since suppliers  may   not have the means and know-how to improve sustainability on 
</p>
<p>their own, buyers often fi nd they must implement collaborations with their suppliers. 
</p>
<p>Such collaboration often takes the form of education and training, capability 
</p>
<p>enhancement, and the introduction of better production methods for productivity 
</p>
<p>improvement. Research has shown the effectiveness of certain collaborative mecha-
</p>
<p>nisms to encourage improved supplier performance (Distelhorst, Hainmueller et al. 
</p>
<p> 2015 ; Vachon and Klassen  2006 ; Locke and Romis  2006 ; Bowen et al.  2001 ). 
</p>
<p>Gimenez and Tachizawa ( 2012 ) fi nd the implementation of both supplier assessment 
</p>
<p>and collaboration with suppliers improves environmental and social performance. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Krause et al. ( 1998 ) investigate fi rms&rsquo; supplier development processes 
</p>
<p>(not specifi c to SER) comparing reactive approaches to strategic efforts to increase 
</p>
<p>supplier capabilities, and thus a fi rm&rsquo;s competitive advantage. The development

<p>process includes identifying suppliers, issues and opportunities, and also collabora-
</p>
<p>tive efforts to increase capabilities, training, rewards and recognition,  and   continu-
</p>
<p>ous improvement programs. Krause et al. ( 2000 ) fi nd direct involvement of a fi rm, 
</p>
<p>including providing supplier incentives, is a key enabler of supplier development. 
</p>
<p> Chen and Lee ( 2015 ) fi nd that a supplier can be vulnerable to noncompliant 
</p>
<p>activities when faced with unexpectedly high costs that threaten its profi t margins. 
</p>
<p>One strategy is to invest in improving the productivity of suppliers, so that it can 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;weather the storm&rdquo; and maintain margins despite cost hikes. Based on a study of 
</p>
<p>25 Indian textile plants from 2009 to 2011, Bloom et al. ( 2013 ) examined the effect 
</p>
<p>of training and support of suppliers. The plants were separated into experimental 
</p>
<p>and control groups, with experimental groups receiving diagnosis, training and 
</p>
<p>consultation on factory operations, quality control, inventory, human resource, and 
</p>
<p>sales, and order management. The experimental groups were found to have signifi -
</p>
<p>cant improvements in quality, inventory performance, and fi nally productivity. 
</p>
<p>This study suggests that collaborating with and training factory management can 
</p>
<p>infl uence a factory&rsquo;s performance. Related to this, Distelhorst, Hainmueller et al. 
</p>
<p>( 2015 ) found that, by introducing Lean 2  production practices to factories supply-
</p>
<p>ing to Nike, labor compliance signifi cantly improved. The study, based on labor 
</p>
<p>compliance data from 2009 to 2013 at 300 factories 2 years prior and 2 years after 
</p>
<p>the introduction of Lean practices, suggests that stronger performance can enable 
</p>
<p>a factory to be more compliant. Chapter   11    , by van Weele and van Tubergen 
</p>
<p>( 2017 ), discusses the phases  that   supplier relationships often go through in making 
</p>
<p>this transition.  
</p>
<p>2   The Lean production process was championed by Toyota, and has been widely adopted by com-
panies as a way to eliminate waste, improve productivity, and increase the effi ciency of production 
systems.

<p>20.3.2.4     Proactive Product and Process Design 
</p>
<p> In quality  management  , it is well-known that product and process design, in addi-
</p>
<p>tion to product inspection and testing, can be an effective way to assure quality. 
</p>
<p>Motorola&rsquo;s Six Sigma process (Pande et al.  2000 ) was based on the premise that, by 
</p>
<p>improving product or process design and management approaches, the variability of 
</p>
<p>processes could be reduced and quality control assured, thereby reducing the reli-
</p>
<p>ance on inspection. Similarly, by improving the design of products or processes, a 
</p>
<p>supplier&rsquo;s manufacturing, farming or other processes can be made less vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>cost shocks and other external disturbances, resulting in a lower risk of sustainabil-
</p>
<p>ity breaches. In Chap.   19    , Scholten and Fynes ( 2017 ) provide a framework for iden-
</p>
<p>tifying and managing risks in supply chains. 
</p>
<p> In the textile industry, Esquel (Pelleg and Lee  2013 ) invested in R&amp;D on the 
</p>
<p>scientifi c development of cotton seeds that are more pest-resistant, so that cotton 
</p>
<p>farmers could use fewer pesticides and insecticides. The company also conducted 
</p>
<p>research on ways in which fabrics could be dyed with less chemicals and water, so 
</p>
<p>that the fabric mills could reduce pollution. Similar &ldquo;design for the environment&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>techniques are now being used by fi rms to reduce the use of water, waste, and energy 
</p>
<p>at various parts of a product&rsquo;s lifecycle. In the agriculture sector, McDonald&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>(Rammohan  2013 ) worked with its major supplier in India to experiment with the 
</p>
<p>right types of potato seeds and growing methods that would achieve an optimal 
</p>
<p>quality and texture, and  increase   productivity of potato farmers.  
</p>
<p>20.3.2.5     Shared Value: Extended Value Creation and Community 
</p>
<p>Development 
</p>
<p> The previous  sections   described how buyer &ldquo;response&rdquo; strategies such as positive 
</p>
<p>incentives and investments in suppliers could improve productivity, reduce noncom-
</p>
<p>pliances, improve sustainability performance, and in some cases, increase the 
</p>
<p>incomes of suppliers. Increasingly, fi rms such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Walmart, 
</p>
<p>Coca-Cola, Unilever, and others are also using shared value strategies to address 
</p>
<p>issues in the supply chain. Shared value is a management strategy focused on com-
</p>
<p>panies creating measurable business value by identifying and addressing social prob-
</p>
<p>lems that intersect with their business (Porter and Kramer  2011 ). One aspect of this 
</p>
<p>concept involves increasing productivity of the company or its suppliers by address-
</p>
<p>ing the social and environmental constraints in its value chain. Li &amp; Fung (Melvin 
</p>
<p> 2015 ) is a consumer goods management fi rm using a shared value approach with the 
</p>
<p>goal of increasing the long-term income of factory workers in addition to factory 
</p>
<p>owners, which in turn, is intended to lead to economic development in regions where 
</p>
<p>suppliers are based. Sometimes, its buyers have also invested in community develop-
</p>
<p>ment such as building infrastructure, engaging in education activities, and creating 
</p>
<p>other income-generating activities in supplier communities. Such shared value cre-
</p>
<p>ation&mdash;delivering value to buyers, to suppliers, to workers, and ultimately, to com-
</p>
<p>munities&mdash;can be considered the highest level of sustainability, and a growing goal

<p>of leading fi rms. Sodhi and Tang ( 2017 ), in Chap.   21    , go deeper into how the stake-
</p>
<p>holder resource-based view  can   make concepts such as shared value more tangible.  
</p>
<p>20.3.2.6     Cascading Responsible Practices to the Extended 
</p>
<p>Supply Network 
</p>
<p> In 2007, Mattel had a massive  recall   of its toys due to the tainting of toys by lead 
</p>
<p>paint (Hoyt et al.  2008 ). The root of the problem turned out to be a pigment supplier 
</p>
<p>using pigment-containing lead. The tainted pigments were provided to a paint sup-
</p>
<p>plier, whose paint was then supplied to a contract manufacturer who manufactured 
</p>
<p>the toys for Mattel. The violation occurred at the third tier of Mattel&rsquo;s supplier net-
</p>
<p>work. As seen by this example, it is often a daunting job for a buyer to effectively 
</p>
<p>check so many layers of a supply chain. This problem points to the need to cascade 
</p>
<p>responsible practices to each supplier tier. 
</p>
<p> Cascading practices to the extended supply network refers to transforming sup-
</p>
<p>pliers to be as vigilant as the buying fi rm in managing and assuring sustainability. If 
</p>
<p>suppliers recognize the value and importance of maintaining the sustainability of its 
</p>
<p>own supply network, and are motivated to engage in similar types of &ldquo;respond&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>strategies as the buyer, then it will increase the chances of the whole supply network 
</p>
<p>being able to effectively address sustainability problems. In other words, the 
</p>
<p>accountability of sustainability must be cascaded to the next level, which in turn 
</p>
<p>should cascade to another level, and so on. As illustrated in the Hewlett-Packard 
</p>
<p>example later in this chapter (Rammohan  2008 ), the company engaged intensively 
</p>
<p>with its key suppliers, with the intent of guiding them in being equally focused on 
</p>
<p>sustainability improvements with their own supply networks. 
</p>
<p> By using a cascading approach, Intel has worked to permeate socially and envi-
</p>
<p>ronmentally responsible practices throughout its supply network (Intel and BSR 
</p>
<p> 2013 ). The company advocates the concept of supplier ownership of issues, so that 
</p>
<p>suppliers will take a proactive approach in determining their own sustainability 
</p>
<p>strategies and objectives. The  company   has experienced positive results when key 
</p>
<p>suppliers such as Murata and Schneider Electric were able to take on the role of 
</p>
<p>sustainability advocates in managing their own supply network.

</p>
<p>or Sticks&mdash;Improving Supplier Social 
</p>
<p>and Environmental Compliance 3  
</p>
<p> As described earlier, a  growing   number of companies are responding to social and 
</p>
<p>environmental risks by implementing supplier incentive schemes for good perfor-
</p>
<p>mance in addition to having strict penalties in place for noncompliance. Starbucks,

</p>
<p>Nike, and HP, for example, incorporate both penalties and incentives into supplier 
</p>
<p>evaluations (Lewis et al.  2012 ; Porteous and Rammohan  2013 ; Rammohan  2008 ). 
</p>
<p>What is the impact of these practices on social, environmental, and economic per-
</p>
<p>formance? Porteous et al. ( 2015 ) developed a model of the relationship between the 
</p>
<p>incentives and penalties buyers issue to suppliers for social and environmental per-
</p>
<p>formance and two outcomes&mdash;improved supplier compliance (measured by a reduc-
</p>
<p>tion in violations of laws or corporate codes of conduct) and buyer-operating costs 
</p>
<p>(used as a measure of a fi rm&rsquo;s economic performance). This model was empirically 
</p>
<p>tested by analyzing opinion-based survey responses from supply chain executives at 
</p>
<p>334 companies across 17 industries. 
</p>
<p> The study did not fi nd a signifi cant relationship between visibility and monitoring 
</p>
<p>efforts (sensing) and reduced violations or reduced operating costs .  This aligns with 
</p>
<p>research that fi nds traditional monitoring for violations through supplier audits, when 
</p>
<p>not complemented with supplier collaboration, can be ineffective in addressing per-
</p>
<p>sistent supplier violations (Locke et al.  2007 ). Instead, the study suggests that incen-
</p>
<p>tives and penalties have a stronger infl uence. The strongest predictors of reduced 
</p>
<p>violations were found to be the penalty of contract termination after a warning, and 
</p>
<p>the incentives of supplier training, increased business and public recognition. This 
</p>
<p>suggests that fi rms can improve supply chain social and environmental performance 
</p>
<p>by ceasing business with continually violating suppliers, while using specifi c incen-
</p>
<p>tives to motivate and further build capabilities of higher-performing suppliers. 
</p>
<p> Some incentives, such as offering suppliers training and increased business for 
</p>
<p>strong SER performance, were associated both with reduction in SER violations 
</p>
<p>and reduced buyer operating costs. These incentives may motivate suppliers to take 
</p>
<p>more ownership of SER in order to benefi t from the rewards on offer. For example, 
</p>
<p>environmental compliance can reduce costs if fewer resources are wasted in the 
</p>
<p>production process, and higher productivity may be realized from  efforts   to improve 
</p>
<p>worker skills and empowerment (Bloom et al.  2013 ). This research supports evi-
</p>
<p>dence that select supplier incentives can improve social, environmental, and eco-
</p>
<p>nomic performance.  
</p>
<p>20.5     Case Examples 
</p>
<p> Many companies employ the sense strategies of traceability, visibility, and monitor-
</p>
<p>ing discussed above. While corporate innovators are using novel means to get a 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;sense&rdquo; of social and environmental performance, there is less variation in these 
</p>
<p>practices when compared to &ldquo;response&rdquo; practices. For example, most companies 
</p>
<p>employ some means of auditing to monitor their suppliers, and conduct traceability 
</p>
<p>to detect hazardous or outlawed materials. Given the many &ldquo;response&rdquo; strategies 
</p>
<p>available to a fi rm, we have chosen to highlight a few case examples of global com-
</p>
<p>panies using innovative &ldquo;response&rdquo; practices with positive results. These cases have 
</p>
<p>been selected to demonstrate that responsible supply chain issues and practices have 
</p>
<p>commonalities across geographies and industries. The cases illustrate that a combi-
</p>
<p>nation of &ldquo;response&rdquo; practices is often required to effect change.

<p>20.5.1     Starbucks C.A.F.E. Practices 4  
</p>
<p> Starbucks is the  world&rsquo;s   largest coffee retailer, and sources from all over the world, 
</p>
<p>including developing regions such as East Africa, Central America, and Indonesia. 
</p>
<p>Coffee farmers in these regions, many of whom live in poverty, are vulnerable to the 
</p>
<p>highly fl uctuating prices on the world coffee market. While Starbucks seeks a stable 
</p>
<p>supply of high-quality coffee, the company has always been focused on ensuring 
</p>
<p>that coffee farmers avoid bankruptcy when coffee prices are low, grow coffee in 
</p>
<p>environmentally sound ways, and that farm owners avoid unsafe or exploitative 
</p>
<p>labor practices. In the early 2000s, Starbucks initiated a program called C.A.F.E. 
</p>
<p>(Coffee and Farmer Equity) Practices to develop a sustainable coffee supply chain. 
</p>
<p> The C.A.F.E. Practices initiative (C.A.F.E) was developed to build mutually ben-
</p>
<p>efi cial relationships with coffee farmers and their communities. C.A.F.E. aimed to 
</p>
<p>(1) increase the economic, social, and environmental sustainability in the specialty 
</p>
<p>coffee industry, including conservation of biodiversity; (2) encourage suppliers to 
</p>
<p>implement C.A.F.E. Practices through economic incentives and preferential buying 
</p>
<p>status; (3) ultimately purchase coffee under C.A.F.E. guidelines; (4) build mutually 
</p>
<p>benefi cial and increasingly direct relationships with suppliers, with long-term con-
</p>
<p>tracts to support Starbucks&rsquo; growth; and (5) promote transparency and economic 
</p>
<p>fairness within the coffee supply chain. 
</p>
<p> C.A.F.E. included a set  of   guidelines designed to support coffee buyers and farm-
</p>
<p>ers, ensure high-quality coffee, promote equitable relationships with farmers, work-
</p>
<p>ers, and communities and protect the environment. It was not a code of conduct or 
</p>
<p>compliance program. The guidelines consisted of a set of supplier prerequisites that 
</p>
<p>had to be met to be considered for C.A.F.E. These standards included coffee quality 
</p>
<p>and economic transparency (suppliers were expected to disclose the amount of 
</p>
<p>money that was ultimately paid to farmers). 
</p>
<p> After the prerequisites were met, suppliers were graded based on a set of envi-
</p>
<p>ronmental and social criteria. They were evaluated not just on performance, but also 
</p>
<p>on their farm supply networks. Farmers were rewarded for coffee growing and pro-
</p>
<p>cessing practices that contributed positively to the conservation of soil, water, 
</p>
<p>energy, and biological diversity, and had minimal impact on the environment. 
</p>
<p>Workers&rsquo; wages needed to meet or exceed the minimum requirements under local 
</p>
<p>and national laws. Effective measures needed to be taken to ensure workers&rsquo; health 
</p>
<p>and safety and to provide them with adequate living conditions. Farms, mills, and 
</p>
<p>suppliers also needed to illustrate equitable payments to those who worked for them 
</p>
<p>or sold to them. They had to demonstrate economic accountability and document 
</p>
<p>their hiring and employment practices. Based on their performance on these criteria, 
</p>
<p>suppliers could earn up to 100 percentage points in C.A.F.E. Practices. Scores were 
</p>
<p>audited by an independent verifi er, and licensed by Scientifi c Certifi cation Systems. 
</p>
<p>Since the verifi er was independent of Starbucks, the cost of the verifi cation had to

<p>453
</p>
<p>be negotiated between the supplier and the verifi er. However, there was no cost to 
</p>
<p>the supplier to submit a C.A.F.E. application to Starbucks. 
</p>
<p> Starbucks invested in capacity building of coffee farmers by setting up farmer 
</p>
<p>support centers in coffee growing regions. These gave technical support and train-
</p>
<p>ing to improve the farmers&rsquo; cultivation and production methods, and provided 
</p>
<p>microfi nancing loans to help farmers in making the necessary investments in tools. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the company used a set of positive incentives. For example, when a sup-
</p>
<p>plier was found to score at least 60 % of the available points in the certifi cation 
</p>
<p>process, the supplier would qualify as a preferred supplier and gain preferential 
</p>
<p>treatment in future purchases (i.e., Starbucks would buy from the supplier fi rst and 
</p>
<p>offer preferential contract terms). Additionally, suppliers who earned scores above 
</p>
<p>80 % would qualify as strategic suppliers and would earn a sustainability conversion 
</p>
<p>premium of $0.05 per pound of coffee for 1 year. 5  To encourage continuous improve-
</p>
<p>ment, the company also offered an additional sustainability performance premium 
</p>
<p>of $0.05 per pound of coffee to suppliers who were able to achieve a 10-point 
</p>
<p>increase above 80 % over the course of a year. 
</p>
<p> C.A.F.E. delivered benefi ts to both Starbucks and suppliers. The company 
</p>
<p>enjoyed a more stable supply base, and gained more direct access to farmers. The 
</p>
<p>farmers benefi ted in several ways. Based on a study in Costa Rica by Earthwatch 
</p>
<p>( 2007 ), C.A.F.E. implementation resulted in annual cost savings of $243 per hect-
</p>

</p>
<p>there was a 25 % increase in yield, which is equivalent to  an   average annual revenue

<p>20.5.2     Case Example: Supplier Collaboration by McDonald&rsquo;s 
</p>
<p>India 6  
</p>
<p> By the  time   McDonald&rsquo;s opened  its   fi rst store in India in 1996, its efforts to source 
</p>
<p>locally had mostly been successful. However, MacFries, as McDonald&rsquo;s French 
</p>
<p>fries were known, were particularly tough to source locally&mdash;and importing fries 
</p>
<p>was undesirable for both cost and availability reasons. While India was the third 
</p>
<p>largest producer of potatoes in the world, less than 1 % were of processed grade, 
</p>
<p>with the necessary high solids, low sugars, large, oblong shape, disease resistance, 
</p>
<p>and long dormancy needed for McDonald&rsquo;s fries. Ideal potato growing season was 
</p>
<p>120&ndash;150 days, compared to the typical 90&ndash;100 days in India. Outdated farming and 
</p>
<p>irrigation practices limited yields as well.

</p>
<p> McDonald&rsquo;s faced many challenges in fi nding cold storage, growing the right 
</p>
<p>type of potatoes locally, and scaling up operations to meet fast-growing demand. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Indian government encouraged small-scale farming, which made 
</p>
<p>it diffi cult to gain economies of scale. It was common to have 50&ndash;100 farms across 
</p>
<p>a 100-acre region, compared to the United States, where the average farm size was 
</p>
<p>418 acres in 2007. Still, sourcing from within the country was particularly important 
</p>
<p>in India, given steep import duties. 
</p>
<p> McDonald&rsquo;s approached one of its suppliers, Canada-based McCain, to import 
</p>
<p>frozen fries. However, duties and lead time were high, making it clear that imports 
</p>
<p>would not be a long-term solution. The company decided to try growing potatoes 
</p>
<p>in India with McCain&rsquo;s help. McCain understood that growing the right potato 
</p>
<p>was the key. In India, the import of raw potatoes was not allowed, so McCain had 
</p>
<p>to bring in the potato germplasm (a collection of genetic resources that could be 
</p>
<p>used to grow potatoes). McCain learned that cultivating potato seeds at high ele-
</p>
<p>vations was ideal  because   seeds grown at high altitude had high vigor, enabling a 
</p>
<p>commercial crop planted with those seeds to have higher yield and larger-sized 
</p>
<p>potatoes. So it instituted a Shepody potato seed multiplication program in the 
</p>
<p>13,000-ft high Lahaul Spiti Valley, part of the Himalayan mountain range in 
</p>
<p>Northern India. 
</p>
<p> McDonald&rsquo;s helped McCain  get   access to excess capacity at Vista Foods, another 
</p>
<p>supplier. McCain produced potato wedges to build up some business with local 
</p>
<p>farmers and convince them to try growing potatoes. Knowing they would have 
</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s commitment to buy fries, McCain built a $25 million (Canadian) man-
</p>
<p>ufacturing facility dedicated to processing French fries, with capacity to process 
</p>
<p>40,000 potatoes. Seeds were planted in farms in the central state of Gujarat in 
</p>
<p>September and October, and potatoes were harvested in February and March. Once 
</p>
<p>processed, fries were frozen and sent to third-party logistics storage facilities or to 
</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s distribution centers. From here, they were shipped to restaurants. 
</p>
<p> McCain established a one-acre demonstration farm in Gujarat for farmers to 
</p>
<p>learn how to grow this new crop. McCain showed farmers the best seeds to use, 
</p>
<p>how to improve yields through more effi cient sowing, drip irrigation, and har-
</p>
<p>vesting techniques. The company transformed storage practices by applying a 
</p>
<p>potato sprout suppressant in combination with using controlled temperature stor-
</p>
<p>age. The local Gujarat government had a scheme to subsidize farmers&rsquo; drip/
</p>
<p>sprinkler irrigation system purchases. Key agricultural breakthroughs were dem-
</p>
<p>onstrated to farmers, such as converting from traditional row planting to mechan-
</p>
<p>ical fi eld preparation, shifting from hand picking of potatoes to mechanical 
</p>
<p>picking, and planting in double rows to utilize space better and reduce water 
</p>
<p>consumption. 
</p>
<p> By 2008, 30 % of McDonald&rsquo;s India&rsquo;s supply was being manufactured locally. 
</p>
<p>By 2010, that number grew to 75 %. The benefi ts to McDonald&rsquo;s from using local 
</p>
<p>fries were a 30 % lower cost structure and no exposure to the fl uctuating exchange 
</p>
<p>rate. With local fries, inventory levels were reduced from an average holding of 15 
</p>
<p>days for imported fries to 6 days for local fries. The reduction in shipping time (60 
</p>
<p>days from the US to less than a day for getting local product) also had a signifi cant

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>455
</p>
<p>benefi t for risk management and contingency planning. In addition, McCain&rsquo;s close 
</p>
<p>relationships with farmers helped ensure a secure supply. There were benefi ts to 
</p>
<p>farmers as well. Traditionally, farmers sold produce at the local &ldquo;mandi,&rdquo; or village 
</p>
<p>market, where sales and prices could fl uctuate dramatically. With McCain, farmers 
</p>
<p>were guaranteed sales of farm output, while seeing an increase in yields of 30&ndash;40 % 
</p>
<p>compared with &ldquo;regular&rdquo; potatoes, reduced operating costs, increased and predict-
</p>
<p>able farm income, and reduced consumption of natural resources like water. Another 
</p>
<p>benefi t was trust. By avoiding selling to a middle man at the mandi, many farmers 
</p>
<p>reported making more money. 
</p>
<p>  McDonald&rsquo;s India   and McCain India had come a long way, not least because 
</p>
<p>they had discovered that close collaboration with farmers was  essential   to their col-
</p>
<p>lective success and to achieving their goal of local sourcing.  
</p>
<p>20.5.3     Case Example: Supplier Collaboration at Hewlett- 
</p>
<p>Packard in China 7  
</p>
<p> With the fast-paced  growth   of the electronics industry in recent decades arose prob-
</p>
<p>lems such as excessive overtime, child labor, environmental pollution, unsafe work-
</p>
<p>ing conditions, and more disadvantages to workers. By 2008, the industry had made 
</p>
<p>important improvements in social and environmental responsibility (SER) compli-
</p>
<p>ance among fi rst-tier suppliers, due in part to the standardization of SER practices 
</p>
<p>set forth in the Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (EICC). Hewlett-Packard 
</p>
<p>(HP), the fi rst company in the industry to implement a supplier code of conduct, had 
</p>
<p>taken a comprehensive approach by educating suppliers on how to achieve compli-
</p>
<p>ance, conducting individual audits and third-party joint audits, and emphasizing 
</p>
<p>continuous improvement. This approach was continually being cascaded to sub-tier 
</p>
<p>suppliers, with the goal of improving standards throughout HP&rsquo;s supply chain. 
</p>
<p>Distelhorst, Locke et al. ( 2015 ) described how results from one HP capability pro-
</p>
<p>gram were not strong. Still the practice of capability building is worth describing 
</p>
<p>here given the growing use of such programs by buyers. 
</p>
<p> What motivated  suppliers   to strive for full SER compliance? Were there business 
</p>
<p>benefi ts to meeting and exceeding standards? In 2009 we explored the business case 
</p>
<p>for SER by examining three HP suppliers with signifi cant operations in China&mdash;
</p>
<p>Flextronics, AU Optronics (AUO), and Delta Electronics. 
</p>
<p> HP&rsquo;s SER program focused on integrating social and environmental require-
</p>
<p>ments into sourcing operations. The company conducted audits on suppliers deemed 
</p>
<p>to be &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; given their location, process, relationships, and/or company infor-
</p>
<p>mation. In 2008, over 400,000 people worked at manufacturing sites audited by HP 
</p>
<p>for SER. In the information technology industry, since the number of suppliers for 
</p>
<p>specifi c components could be limited, HP focused heavily on working with existing 
</p>
<p>7   The materials on this case were drawn from Rammohan ( 2008 ). 
</p>
<p>20 Improving Social and Environmental Performance in Global Supply Chains</p>
<p/>

<p>456
</p>
<p>suppliers to improve SER activities. Through self-assessments in 2008, HP identi-
</p>
<p>fi ed around 200 &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; suppliers around the world. 
</p>
<p> At HP suppliers Flextronics and AUO,    executives reported that SER activities 
</p>
<p>generated several business benefi ts. Both suppliers improved environmental, labor, 
</p>
<p>and health and safety performance from 2005 to 2008. While formal supplier SER 
</p>
<p>programs at both companies were only 2&ndash;3 years old at the time of the case, certain 
</p>
<p>short-term business benefi ts had already been realized. Delta began SER work in 
</p>
<p>2002 at HP&rsquo;s request but did not report seeing concrete business benefi ts from 2002 
</p>
<p>to 2008. Later, HP began to increase the importance of SER ratings in its supplier 
</p>
<p>evaluation process, providing suppliers with more of an incentive to perform well. 
</p>
<p>Below are the key SER benefi ts suppliers reported in 2008:
</p>
<p>&bull;    SER can help a company become a supplier of choice. Flextronics and AUO 
</p>
<p>executives felt that SER could enhance their reputation with many stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Certain environmental investments can have short-term payoffs. In 2007, AUO 
</p>
<p>implemented several environmental projects that delivered fi nancial benefi ts. 
</p>
<p>Investment costs related to water recycling and reduction projects, dormitory 
</p>
<p>solar panels, and exhaust recycling were outweighed by savings from most of 
</p>
<p>these projects in the fi rst year alone. In the years preceding 2008, AUO&rsquo;s energy, 
</p>
<p>water, and waste per substrate (a standard unit of glass used to manufacture com-
</p>
<p>puter panels) signifi cantly decreased. Meanwhile, overall energy, water, and 
</p>
<p>waste increased due to higher production output.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   Health and safety programs can reduce accident rates. Both AUO and Flextronics 
</p>
<p>made improvements to their health and safety programs. They found that 
</p>
<p>strengthening safety training, improving/installing machine guards, and improv-
</p>
<p>ing/providing protective gear such as masks and gloves for workers resulted in 
</p>
<p>lower accident rates. This saved costs by reducing the time a worker is unproduc-
</p>
<p>tive, and was believed by some to reduce healthcare costs.  
</p>
<p>&bull;   There is potential  for   benefi cial labor practices such as limiting overtime, paying 
</p>
<p>fair wages, and providing employee welfare activities, good dormitories, can-
</p>
<p>teens, and other amenities to reduce or limit attrition in the future.    
</p>
<p> This case highlights benefi ts suppliers achieved when collaborating closely with 
</p>
<p>HP. In addition to the short-term gains realized, suppliers recognized the  potential 
</p>
<p>  for longer term benefi ts from SER activities.  
</p>
<p>20.5.4     Case Example: Comprehensive Sustainability 
</p>
<p>at Li and Fung 8  
</p>
<p> Li &amp; Fung Limited is  a   Hong Kong-based global leader in consumer goods design, 
</p>
<p>development, sourcing, and distribution. It serves retailers and brands around the 
</p>
<p>world by managing a network of over 15,000 supplier companies in more than 
</p>
<p>8   The  materials in this case were drawn from Melvin ( 2015 ).

</p>
<p>40 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. In 2013 this sourcing and 
</p>
<p>trading activity accounted for more than $16 billion of revenue. Sustainability is of 
</p>
<p>great importance to Li &amp; Fung, since its brand owner customers expect the com-
</p>
<p>pany to manage the sustainability of the supply network for them, and because 
</p>
<p>former chairman Dr. Victor Fung held a personal passion for sustainability. The 
</p>
<p>company recognized that factory audits were not suffi cient to ensure a sustainable 
</p>
<p>supply network, and that suppliers, many of them located in developing economies, 
</p>
<p>might not have the capability and resources to develop sustainable practices. The 
</p>
<p>company identifi ed that one of the impediments to sustainability was supplier 
</p>
<p>productivity. 
</p>
<p> In January 2014, Li &amp; Fung announced the creation of a new business unit called 
</p>
<p>Vendor Support Services ( VSS  )   . The new unit provided services to a vast supply 
</p>
<p>network on safety and compliance training, audits, trade credit services, product 
</p>
<p>development, and technical and operations support. VSS would build on the com-
</p>
<p>pany&rsquo;s knowledge about the supply chain and access to best practices and emerging 
</p>
<p>trends to create a stronger vendor ecosystem that was economically vibrant and 
</p>
<p>socially and environmentally sustainable. Instead of just auditing, Li &amp; Fung 
</p>
<p>became a coach, providing capacity building, skills, knowledge support, training, 
</p>
<p>technology, fi nancial assistance, and connections. VSS manufacturers improve 
</p>
<p>environmental performance by educating them on energy effi ciency, carbon emis-
</p>
<p>sions management, waste and water management, and then helping suppliers imple-
</p>
<p>ment improvements. 
</p>
<p> While production costs and compliance standards were rising, suppliers were 
</p>
<p>also faced with shorter turnaround times, driven by trends such as fast fashion and 
</p>
<p>advancements in retail technologies and e-commerce. Thus, VSS also offered sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain productivity services like Lean training, industrial engineering, and pro-
</p>
<p>ductivity consulting. 
</p>
<p> Li &amp; Fung&rsquo;s sustainability efforts were also intended to benefi t the communities 
</p>
<p>in which its many vendors were located by creating better economic, environmen-
</p>
<p>tal, and social ecosystems. This concept is related to &ldquo;shared value,&rdquo; described in the 
</p>
<p>previous section. The company had long viewed itself as &ldquo;an essential hub in the 
</p>
<p>wheel of economic development that starts by enabling job creation in emerging 
</p>
<p>markets and supporting employers (factories) to keep moving up the value chain.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Improvements in factory productivity could directly benefi t workers. At one factory 
</p>
<p>in India, for example, a signifi cant increase in productivity over a 6-month period in 
</p>
<p>turn helped raise the monthly wage of workers paid by the piece from 1000 to 4000 
</p>
<p>rupees and led to a steep drop in absenteeism (Melvin  2015 ). Factories that pro-
</p>
<p>duced sustainably and provided safe, steady employment were of critical impor-
</p>
<p>tance in developing stronger communities and better-off families, and in enabling 
</p>
<p>social mobility. 
</p>
<p> Just as improved productivity and standards can benefi t workers through better 
</p>
<p>conditions and higher salaries, investing in worker well-being can also create tan-
</p>
<p>gible benefi ts for factories. Since 2010 Li &amp; Fung has supported certain customers 
</p>
<p> in   implementing the HER Project (Health Enables Returns), training largely female

</p>
<p>workforces about personal and reproductive health and hygiene issues over 18 
</p>
<p>months as a way to reduce absenteeism, increase productivity, and build loyalty 
</p>
<p>amongst factory employees.  
</p>
<p>20.5.5     Case Example: Investing in Cotton Suppliers at Esquel 9  
</p>
<p>  Esquel Corporation      is the largest cotton-shirt manufacturer in the world. Its major 
</p>
<p>cotton supply comes from Xinjiang, a developing province in northwestern China. 
</p>
<p>Esquel has been focused on environmental protection and sustainable development 
</p>
<p>in its supply bases. The company has hosted conferences to educate communities on 
</p>
<p>the importance of protecting the environment and deployed an Eco Mobile Lab&mdash;a 
</p>
<p>classroom on wheels&mdash;to bring the message of environmental protection to primary 
</p>
<p>schoolchildren in hard-to-reach areas. The lab visited remote areas in Xinjiang, edu-
</p>
<p>cating children on conservation through interactive and entertaining activities. 
</p>
<p>During seven tours of the Xinjiang province, the Eco Mobile Lab reached 146 
</p>
<p>schools and over 138,000 students and teachers. As part of the activities, over 
</p>
<p>22,000 trees were planted. 
</p>
<p> Through the Esquel-Y.L. Yang Education Foundation, the company supported 
</p>
<p>local education in Xinjiang, fi nancing the rebuilding of decrepit schools and donat-
</p>
<p>ing mini-libraries for rural communities. Over the years, Esquel had rebuilt 12 
</p>
<p>schools in various rural locations, and set up around 800 mini-libraries throughout 
</p>
<p>Xinjiang. Esquel employees participated directly in projects in less fortunate com-
</p>
<p>munities. With employee and company contributions, Esquel provided thousands 
</p>
<p>of needy children with fi nancial support for basic education expenses such as tuto-
</p>
<p>rial and exercise books. Finally, Esquel sponsored college students to study sci-
</p>
<p>ence, and provided scholarships to outstanding high school graduates to attend 
</p>
<p>university. 
</p>
<p> Esquel was  focused   on developing the local agricultural economy in Xinjiang, 
</p>
<p>and on protecting farmers. To improve the quality of the cotton and minimize 
</p>
<p> impurities, Esquel provided farmers free pure cotton garments as a benefi t. It also 
</p>
<p>offered farmers workshops on cotton farming, and invited them to visit its spin-
</p>
<p>ning mills to demonstrate the impact of cotton quality on the quality of the yarn, 
</p>
<p>and eventually, the garments. A research team in Xinjiang looked for ways to 
</p>
<p>modify the cottonseeds to achieve higher-quality cotton, with better strength and 
</p>
<p>fi ber length. The research team also studied irrigation methods in order to con-
</p>
<p>serve water, a scarce resource in Xinjiang. A dedicated team worked with local 
</p>
<p>farmers in Xinjiang on sustainable farming techniques, and advised them on ways 
</p>
<p>to grow and collect the cotton so as to improve quality while at the same time 
</p>
<p>increasing the farmers&rsquo; income. These efforts also enabled farmers to grow organic

</p>
<p>cotton with high productivity. In addition, Esquel placed orders with the farmers 
</p>
<p>in advance, when the cotton was planted, and guaranteed them a minimum price, 
</p>
<p>with the maximum set by the market. Both Esquel and the farmers benefi ted from 
</p>
<p>this arrangement: farmers were not wiped out if prices went extremely low, and 
</p>
<p>Esquel secured its cotton supply and also had better rapport with the farmers, who 
</p>
<p>were wary of dealing with foreign capitalists after decades of selling only to  the 
</p>
<p>  government.  
</p>
<p>20.5.6     Case Example: Creating Shared Value at Nestl&eacute;&mdash;Rural 
</p>
<p>Development Initiatives 10  
</p>
<p> Nestl&eacute; is the world&rsquo;s  largest   food and nutrition company, and procures agricultural 
</p>
<p>commodities from many emerging economies (Africa, South America, and South 
</p>
<p>East Asia). Creating Shared Value ( CSV  )    has been the basic way Nestl&eacute; conducted 
</p>
<p>its business to create long-term value for shareholders and for society.  CSV   involved 
</p>
<p>compliance with laws, Nestl&eacute; business principles, and codes of conduct developed 
</p>
<p>by Nestl&eacute;. CSV also ensured sustainable development that meets the needs of the 
</p>
<p>present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
</p>
<p>evolving needs. 
</p>
<p> Nestl&eacute; identifi ed rural development as one of the areas that they would focus on 
</p>
<p>for their CSV initiatives. To create value for its suppliers, Nestl&eacute; developed CSV 
</p>
<p>initiatives intended to help the poor farmers to break the vicious circle of poverty: 
</p>
<p> In many developing countries, the farming business is fragmented and most 
</p>
<p>farmers run their operations on small lots of farmland (average 1.5 ha). Scale is low 
</p>
<p>and small farmers are spread over wide geographies, and thus often have to sell 
</p>
<p>through layers of middlemen, who sell to wholesalers, who sell to brand owners. 
</p>
<p>This long and ineffi cient supply chain creates a lose&ndash;lose situation: (a) farmers get 
</p>
<p>a low selling price; and (b) the brand owner such as Nestl&eacute; pays a high purchasing 
</p>
<p>price for crops that may not be fresh (due to delays in handling and transportation). 
</p>
<p>In China, Nestl&eacute; worked with over 40,000 fresh milk suppliers (farmers) by adapt-
</p>
<p>ing the &ldquo;Swiss Milk District System&rdquo; which involved: (1) disintermediation: cut the 
</p>
<p>middlemen by developing transportation and infrastructure to collect milk directly 
</p>
<p>from farmers; (2) aggregation: group famers into &ldquo;districts&rdquo; to reduce logistics costs 
</p>
<p>for the farmers who deliver their milk to the milk collection centers; (3) quality: 
</p>
<p>establish milk collection centers with quality controls and cooling tanks to reduce 
</p>
<p>spoilage and improve quality; (4) productivity: provide free veterinary services and 
</p>
<p>animal husbandry to improve the quality and productivity of milk production; and 
</p>
<p>(5) fi nancial assistance. 
</p>
<p>10   The materials of this case were drawn from Lee et al. ( 2015 ).

<p>20 Improving Social and Environmental Performance in Global Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>460
</p>
<p> There are two fundamental ways to help farmers reduce production costs: (a) 
</p>
<p>improve yield and quality; and (b) increase productivity. Nestl&eacute; provides technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to farmers so that they can produce milk and crops more effectively and 
</p>
<p>effi ciently. 
</p>
<p> Nestl&eacute; built its own &ldquo;cold chain&rdquo; due to lack of infrastructure in many low- 
</p>
<p>income countries. This involved collecting milk directly from farmers using 
</p>
<p>Nestl&eacute; containers, processing collected milk, storing pasteurized milk safely, and 
</p>
<p>transporting fi nished products to markets. In many developing countries, Nestl&eacute; 
</p>
<p>built food processing facilities (e.g., coffee roasting facilities, milk pasteurizing 
</p>
<p>facilities) in rural areas of low-income countries. In 2010, 60 % of Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s 422 
</p>
<p>factories were located in rural areas, thus creating new nonfarm employment 
</p>
<p>opportunities.  By   expanding the local pool of skilled workers, Nestl&eacute; made the 
</p>
<p>area more attractive to other potential employers, which is essential for rural 
</p>
<p>development. Not only can these job opportunities generate higher income, but 
</p>
<p>these  facilities   create an effi cient supply chain (lower cost, higher quality, and 
</p>
<p>higher volume) for Nestl&eacute;. 
</p>
<p>20.5.6.1     Summary of Case Examples 
</p>
<p> By understanding supplier management practices such as visibility and monitoring 
</p>
<p>methods, incentives and penalties, supplier collaboration and other practices associ-
</p>
<p>ated with improved compliance and improved business performance, fi rms can bet-
</p>
<p>ter target investments in  responsible   supplier management. In Table  20.1 , we 
</p>
<p>summarize the &ldquo;response&rdquo; strategies used by the fi rms highlighted in the cases 
</p>
<p>above, along with the benefi ts achieved. As mentioned earlier, we focus on 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;response&rdquo; strategies due to the greater variation in corporate practices compared to 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;sense&rdquo; practices.
</p>
<p>20.6          Summary 
</p>
<p> There is a need for more research on the impact of various sense and response sus-
</p>
<p>tainability strategies on social, environmental, and economic performance. As 
</p>
<p>responsible supply chain management continues to evolve and incorporate practices 
</p>
<p>that go beyond monitoring efforts, there is an opportunity to better integrate man-
</p>
<p>agement into core supply chain operations in order to have a stronger impact on 
</p>
<p>conditions in global supply chains. For fi rms which engage the entire supply chain 
</p>
<p>in the search for breakthroughs and risk reduction, there are opportunities to gain 
</p>
<p>competitive advantage (Lee  2010 ). Calls for increased collaboration with suppliers 
</p>
<p>and stronger incentives (Plambeck et al.  2012 ) will likely continue to grow, as will 
</p>
<p>the call to improve monitoring methods, seek opportunities to build shared value, 
</p>
<p>and ultimately cascade these practices to suppliers throughout a fi rm&rsquo;s network in 
</p>
<p>order to create lasting change.

<p> Social Responsibility in Supply Chains

</p>
<p>21.1           Introduction 
</p>
<p> Companies are increasingly confronted with social responsibility questions in the 
</p>
<p>media along the entirety of the supply chain they are seen to control and they fi nd it 
</p>
<p>particularly challenging. We look at how companies can design and operate supply 
</p>
<p>chains to fulfi l their social responsibility and aim to address four key questions that 
</p>
<p>face managers and researchers. 
</p>
<p> One question is about the choice of the level and scope of supply chain operations 
</p>
<p>to take into account. Supply chain operations comprise coupled processes that in turn 
</p>
<p>comprise coupled sub-processes and so on, whether within a department or across 
</p>
<p>many companies. Moreover, for social responsibility, the context of analysis is typi-
</p>
<p>cally a large company. Such a company would typically have a global supply chain 
</p>
<p>entailing many other large and small companies so the context for any analysis or 
</p>
<p>application has to be chosen carefully. Finally, the observed operations may be consid-
</p>
<p>ered &lsquo;socially responsible&rsquo; at one level and in one context but not so at another level or 
</p>
<p>in another context. An example is the 2014 spat between Oxfam and American actress 
</p>
<p>Scarlett Johanssen, then brand ambassador for the charity. Johanssen also became the 
</p>
<p>brand ambassador for SodaStream, an Israeli company manufacturing in the occupied 
</p>
<p>West Bank, claiming the company contributed to peace by giving jobs to Palestinian 
</p>
<p>people under occupation. At another level, Oxfam maintained that &ldquo;businesses, such as 
</p>
<p>SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of 
</p>
<p>rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support.&rdquo; (BBC  2014 )

</p>
<p> A second question pertains to the large number of alternative defi nitions as well 
</p>
<p>as the huge and diverse objectives of social responsibility. Dahlsrud ( 2008 ) has 
</p>
<p>identifi ed 37 defi nitions of CSR from various researchers and industry bodies 
</p>
<p>(mostly in the period 1998&ndash;2003). In the operations literature, Carter and Jennings 
</p>
<p>( 2004 ) take CSR to include business ethics, philanthropy, community, workplace 
</p>
<p>diversity, safety, human rights, and environment. Lists of objectives tend to be 
</p>
<p>rather long&mdash;see for instance Carroll ( 1979 ,  1999 ) and Bowen ( 1953 :8&ndash;12) although 
</p>
<p>Friedman ( 1970 ) advocates the  single-objective view   that &lsquo;the social responsibility 
</p>
<p>of business is to increase its profi ts&rsquo;. Dealing with multiple objectives raises the 
</p>
<p>question of Pareto effi ciency (how to trade off one objective against another) as well 
</p>
<p>as maximizing versus  satisfi cing  (meeting some threshold value of) these objectives 
</p>
<p>(Ackoff  1970 ). Shareholders may also content themselves with satisfi cing share-
</p>
<p>holder value (Monsen and Downs  1965 ). 
</p>
<p> A third question is how companies can be socially responsible by working 
</p>
<p>directly with the weaker members of society, the &lsquo;poor&rsquo;, who comprise the majority 
</p>
<p>in every society. Social responsibility refers to the responsibility of business to 
</p>
<p> society. In the business-and-society discourse, &lsquo;business&rsquo; really means large compa-
</p>
<p>nies (corporations) because &ldquo;the powerful are given closer scrutiny&rdquo; (Carroll and 
</p>
<p>Buchholtz  2012 :6; see also Bowen  1953 :6), narrowing further on the senior manag-
</p>
<p>ers who make strategic decisions at these companies (cf. Bowen  1953 ). Equally, 
</p>
<p>while &lsquo;society&rsquo; is a broad concept, political, media and research attention is focused 
</p>
<p>on those at the other end of the power spectrum, i.e., groups of people without eco-
</p>
<p>nomic or political power: employees, small suppliers, and local communities. So 
</p>
<p>the question is: can companies with economic power run supply chains to meet the 
</p>
<p>needs of the weakest in society, the poor, not just by selling to them but also by 
</p>
<p>employing them or buying from them to improve their  economic level  ? 
</p>
<p> A fi nal question for  managers and OM researchers   is to decide whether to or how 
</p>
<p>to develop overarching frameworks to guide a company&rsquo;s strategy to incorporate 
</p>
<p>social responsibility. An overarching framework requires consistency with theoreti-
</p>
<p>cal frameworks already in use in the strategy, the OM and the social responsibility 
</p>
<p>literature and practice. For instance, strategists may use resource-based view, OM 
</p>
<p>modelling may entail utility theory and the social responsibility practitioners may 
</p>
<p>draw on stakeholder theory. The alternative would be either to develop an entirely 
</p>
<p>new framework or to separate social responsibility efforts from its operations by, 
</p>
<p>for instance, relying solely on philanthropy.  
</p>
<p>21.2     Literature Review 
</p>
<p>21.2.1     Corporate Social Responsibility 
</p>
<p> The social obligations of business are generally codifi ed as corporate social respon-
</p>
<p>sibility (CSR). Rangan et al. ( 2015 ) describe two other &lsquo;theatres&rsquo; for a company 
</p>
<p>doing  CSR   besides philanthropy: operational improvement, and new business 
</p>
<p>M.S. Sodhi and C.S. Tang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>467
</p>
<p>models. In the OM literature, there is interest in how CSR initiatives impact pur-
</p>
<p>chasing and supply chain management (Cruz  2009 ) and how supply chain managers 
</p>
<p>incorporate or implement CSR (Carter and Jennings  2004 ; Carter  2005 ; Maloni and 
</p>
<p>Brown  2006 ). London et al. ( 2010 ) examine value creation with social enterprises, 
</p>
<p>while Sodhi and Tang ( 2011 ) take a supply-chain perspective on these enterprises. 
</p>
<p> In general, there remains considerable scepticism about whether a modern cor-
</p>
<p>poration can or does fulfi l its social obligations (Banerjee  2007 ; Devinney  2009 ). 
</p>
<p>Such scepticism may explain why research in &lsquo;socially responsible operations&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>tends to focus on social enterprises, small farmers, foundations, etc. Only a handful 
</p>
<p>of papers in the operations or supply chain literature focus on large company initia-
</p>
<p>tives such as ITC&rsquo;s e-choupal, an electronic platform to provide farmers the 
</p>
<p> company&rsquo;s purchase price one day in advance, or Unilever&rsquo;s Shakti Amma, training 
</p>
<p>women in rural areas to sell Unilever&rsquo;s products with fi nancial help from microfi -
</p>
<p>nance NGOs. Some additional examples are provided by Lee and Rammohan 
</p>
<p>( 2017 ) in Chap.   20    .  
</p>
<p>21.2.2     Sustainability 
</p>
<p> &lsquo; Sustainability  &rsquo; has become an instrument for large companies to subsume diverse 
</p>
<p>company initiatives pertaining to CSR, environment, and profi tability. It provides 
</p>
<p>companies a way to align their CSR and environmental efforts with profi tability. 
</p>
<p>Originally, the concept was conceived as being broader in scope (cf. Elkinton 
</p>
<p> 1998 ): The Brundtland Commission defi ned it &ldquo;as development that meets the needs 
</p>
<p>of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
</p>
<p>needs&rdquo; (Carter and Rogers  2008 ). 
</p>
<p> Elkinton ( 1998 ) presents sustainability as having three &lsquo;pillars&rsquo;&mdash;economic, 
</p>
<p>environmental and social&mdash;with overlapping zones. Such overlapping zones are 
</p>
<p>helpful for a company because it can report initiatives as serving the environmental 
</p>
<p>(or social) cause even when these are economically motivated. Indeed, the most 
</p>
<p>commonly reported initiatives in companies&rsquo; sustainability reports are about the 
</p>
<p>reduction in energy consumption. However, the focus on overlaps avoids the 
</p>
<p> awkward question of how to make trade-offs between profi tability and social 
</p>
<p>objectives&mdash;see Pagell and Shevchenko ( 2014 ) in this regard. There are also trade-
</p>
<p>offs between environmental and economic sustainability: shutting down coalmines 
</p>
<p>(to reduce pollution) adversely affects the economic and social sustainability of 
</p>
<p>mining communities. 
</p>
<p> The OM literature has considered sustainability from an environmental perspec-
</p>
<p>tive without explicit incorporation of the social aspects (Carter and Rogers  2008 ). 
</p>
<p>Sustainability has entered the OM literature as &lsquo;sustainable  operations   manage-
</p>
<p>ment&rsquo; (Kleindorfer et al.  2005 ), or more commonly as, &lsquo;sustainable supply chain 
</p>
<p>management&rsquo; (cf. Linton et al.  2007 ; Seuring and M&uuml;ller  2008 ; Pagell and Wu 
</p>
<p> 2009 ; Carter and Easton  2011 ). Pagell and Shevchenko ( 2014 ) argue that sustain-
</p>
<p>ability should be entrenched in all aspects of supply chains.

<p>21.2.3     The &lsquo;Poor&rsquo;, the Bottom of the Pyramid 
</p>
<p>and Shared Value 
</p>
<p> The &lsquo;bottom-of-the-pyramid&rsquo; (Prahalad  2006 ) approach entails large companies seek-
</p>
<p>ing to  increase   profi ts by selling goods and services to the &lsquo;poor&rsquo; and possibly using 
</p>
<p>them as suppliers or distributors while doing so. Such operations can require redesign-
</p>
<p>ing goods and packaging such as Unilever selling shampoo or its skin- colour- 
</p>
<p>lightening product in small sachets to poor consumers in developing countries 
</p>
<p>(Karamchandani et al.  2011 ). However, Karnani ( 2007 ) provides economic arguments 
</p>
<p>against such marketing of consumer goods to the bottom-of-the-pyramid poor. A 
</p>
<p>broader approach is the &lsquo;base-of-the-pyramid&rsquo; (cf. London and Hart  2011 ) where 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;shared value&rsquo; is highlighted. An example is the German company Bayer selling agri-
</p>
<p>cultural chemicals in small packets to smallholder farmers in developing countries 
</p>
<p>(Karamchandani et al.  2011 ) creating profi ts for itself and the farmers. The redesign 
</p>
<p>of modes of production and delivery using the poor as suppliers and distributors  can  
</p>
<p>make help them in becoming economically better off (Sodhi and Tang  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Engagement with the &lsquo;base&rsquo; of the pyramid requires new business models to 
</p>
<p>engage with the &lsquo;poor&rsquo; as customers or suppliers. Karamchandani et al. ( 2011 ) discuss 
</p>
<p>challenges for companies wishing to engage profi tably with the bottom of the pyra-
</p>
<p>mid: (1) uncertainty of cash fl ows given the large number of low-margin and low-
</p>
<p>value transactions, (2) gauging demand and working in &lsquo;informal&rsquo; markets, (3) sales 
</p>
<p>and distribution, (4) providers being neither aggregated nor capable enough to provide 
</p>
<p>quality or volume, (5) business ecosystems not being able to support initiatives. 
</p>
<p> Although sustainable development  has   been studied extensively in the develop-
</p>
<p>ment economics literature (Ray  1998 ; Lal  2000 ; Hayami  2005 ),  operational  issues in 
</p>
<p>this context have not been explored much yet. Sodhi and Tang ( 2011 ) have looked at 
</p>
<p>social enterprises from a supply chain perspective: These are not large companies but 
</p>
<p>the work of social enterprises has practical implications for what large companies 
</p>
<p>can do. They explore this idea further by looking at the poor as suppliers or distribu-
</p>
<p>tors in supply chain rather than as consumers (Sodhi and Tang  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> The relationship between the company and those at the bottom of the pyramid 
</p>
<p>can create &lsquo;shared value&rsquo; (Porter and Kramer  2006 ), which recalls the overlaps 
</p>
<p>between the pillars of sustainability &ldquo;by reconceiving the intersection between soci-
</p>
<p>ety and corporate performance&rdquo;. However, they avoid discussing how to divide the 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;shared&rsquo; value (Coff  1999 ); Crane et al. ( 2014 ) provide some more limitations of the 
</p>
<p>&lsquo;shared  value&rsquo;   concept.  
</p>
<p>21.2.4     Stakeholder Resource-Based View 
</p>
<p> To better understand how to incorporate social responsibility in supply chain opera-
</p>
<p>tions, Sodhi ( 2015 ) outlines &lsquo;stakeholder resource-based view&rsquo; ( SRBV  ) building on 
</p>
<p>resource-based view,  utility   theory and stakeholder theory. 
</p>

</p>
<p> One model for companies to build lasting competitive advantage is the  resource- 
</p>
<p>based view  ( RBV  )    or  its   extensions (cf. Hart  1995 ; Lavie  2006 ), whereby part of the 
</p>
<p>resources are bundled as fi rm-specifi c &lsquo;capabilities&rsquo; that the fi rm develops in a static 
</p>
<p>economic setting (cf. Wernerfelt  1984 ; Barney  2001 ). The resources must raise bar-
</p>
<p>riers to entry to others if a competitive advantage is to be durable (Rumelt  1984 ). In 
</p>
<p>a dynamic economic setting with high uncertainty, resources have to be changed 
</p>
<p>using &lsquo;dynamic capabilities&rsquo; as the fi rm seeks competitive  survival  in a rapidly 
</p>
<p>changing environment (cf. Teece et al.  1997 ).  Dynamic capabilities   &ldquo;are the organi-
</p>
<p>zational and strategic routines by which fi rms achieve new resource reconfi gurations 
</p>
<p>as markets emerge, collide, split, evolve, and die&rdquo; (Eisenhardt and Martin  2000 ) 
</p>
<p>although there are many other defi nitions (Ambrosini and Bowman  2009 ). &lsquo;Dynamic&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>refers to the external environment rather than to the capabilities, which are built 
</p>
<p>around &lsquo;routines&rsquo; that are the organization&rsquo;s processes. Being able to deliver on social 
</p>
<p>responsibility could be a fi rm&rsquo;s capability or dynamic capability. But dynamic capa-
</p>
<p>bility, say, with the company moving facilities from one low-cost country to another 
</p>
<p>lower-cost one continually, could also be tied to social  irresponsibility . 
</p>
<p> Garriga and Mel&eacute; ( 2004 ) classify theories in the  social responsibility literature   
</p>
<p>as: (1)  instrumental theories  with the corporation solely as an instrument for wealth 
</p>
<p>creation so any social responsibility activity only serves to further that aim; (2) 
</p>
<p> political theories  about the responsible use power of corporations in society and the 
</p>
<p>politics; (3)  integrative theories  on how business integrates social demands based 
</p>
<p>on the assumption that business depends on society for its existence, continuity and 
</p>
<p>growth; and (4)  ethical theories  based on ethical responsibilities of corporations to 
</p>
<p>society. These can overlap: integrative theories can potentially be reconciled with 
</p>
<p>instrumental theories if a company can meet some social demands only to make 
</p>
<p>more profi ts in the long run, then it is trying to be integrate society into its decisions. 
</p>
<p>If political power, such as that exerted by large companies on governments, from 
</p>
<p>this perspective is for increasing wealth then an instrumental view can subsume 
</p>
<p>political views as well. 
</p>
<p> One  integrative theory   is  stakeholder theory  (Freeman  2010 ). The assumption 
</p>
<p>is that managers have fi duciary duties to the corporation, not just to the sharehold-
</p>
<p>ers, and the stakeholders are all the people and groups with an interest in the 
</p>
<p> corporation. According to Donaldson and Preston ( 1995 ), the interests of all stake-
</p>
<p>holders are of intrinsic value and &ldquo;each group of stakeholders merits consideration 
</p>
<p>for its own sake and not merely because of its ability to further the interests of some 
</p>
<p>other group, such as the shareowners&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p> In the analytical operations and supply chain literature,   utility theory    is used in 
</p>
<p>the economics of decision-making. Here, the assumption is  that   we have rational 
</p>
<p>players who seek to maximize their utility&mdash;their preference for goods and 
</p>
<p> services&mdash;given the possible/actual moves of the other players. Utility theory is 
</p>
<p>consistent with the corporation as an instrument for wealth creation for wealth-
</p>
<p>maximizing shareholders. And if the concept of utility can extend to the  means  for 
</p>
<p>acquiring goods and services, we have a broad concept maximizing which can 
</p>
<p>cover both resources (as in the resource-based view) under known conditions and 
</p>
<p>dynamic capabilities under uncertainty.

</p>
<p> Building on RBV, utility theory and stakeholder theory, Sodhi ( 2015 ) proposes 
</p>
<p> stakeholder resource-based view  (SRBV), defi ned as
</p>
<p>  SRBV is a model to guide the decision-making of managers towards maximizing their util-
ity by developing their organization&rsquo;s capabilities&mdash;dynamic capabilities, resources and 
routines&mdash;while recognizing the need to improve the respective utilities of other groups of 
the organization&rsquo;s stakeholders, possibly by helping them develop their respective capabili-
ties as extensions of the company&rsquo;s own capabilities. Under SRBV, stakeholders for the 
organization are those whose utility is signifi cantly dependent on these managers&rsquo; 
decisions. 
</p>
<p>   SRBV helps managers recognize, whether for a company or for particular opera-
</p>
<p>tions within a company or across companies, that  there are different groups of 
</p>
<p> stakeholders with their respective resources, routines and dynamic capabilities, 
</p>
<p>seeking to maximize their respective utilities under uncertainty and over their 
</p>
<p>respective time horizons . Stakeholders for a large corporate include those involved 
</p>
<p>in  operations  :  suppliers  such as smallholder farmers and contract labourers,  employ-
</p>
<p>ees ,  mid-level managers ,  senior managers , and  distributors/wholesalers/franchi-
</p>
<p>sees. Shareholders ,  government ,  communities  in which facilities are located, and 
</p>
<p> consumers  are also stakeholders. Note that the &lsquo;company&rsquo; or &lsquo;corporation&rsquo; is not a 
</p>
<p>monolith&mdash;instead, we have senior managers, mid-level managers and shareholders 
</p>
<p>of companies although our focus is on senior managers as decision makers. Under 
</p>
<p>SRBV, each stakeholder (individually or as a group) is treated on a par with other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders from a research perspective. 
</p>
<p> SRBV allows the manager as well as the researcher to tackle the four key ques-
</p>
<p>tions listed in Sect.  21.1 : 
</p>
<p> The fi rst question was about the choice of  the   level and scope of supply chain 
</p>
<p> operations   to take into account. Under SRBV, there is no explicit restriction. The 
</p>
<p>manager could consider any subset of stakeholders as long as the utility and 
</p>
<p> capabilities of each (type of) stakeholder is fully accounted for. In the Johanssen-
</p>
<p>Oxfam example, both sides could agree on the utility of Palestinians obtained from 
</p>
<p>gainful employment at Israeli companies operating in the occupied territories. But 
</p>
<p>equally, they could agree that there are other (non-working) Palestinians whose 
</p>
<p> utility is affected by living conditions under occupation, which is only solidifi ed 
</p>
<p>through the operations of Israeli companies. Under SRBV, the manager 
</p>
<p>(or researcher) has to treat all stakeholders of interest on a par with each other to 
</p>
<p>understand them at an economic level. Different managers may select different sub-
</p>
<p>sets of stakeholder groups but they can agree on any stakeholder&rsquo;s utility derived 
</p>
<p>from the operations in scope. Furthermore, the unit of observation is the &ldquo;opera-
</p>
<p>tion&rdquo;, whatever its scope. A particular manager researcher will have to scope out the 
</p>
<p>breadth and level of the operations over which he or she can make decisions. 
</p>
<p> The second question pertained to the large number of alternative defi nitions as 
</p>
<p>well as the huge and diverse objectives of social responsibility. Under SRBV, we 
</p>
<p>have a broad conceptual view of utility and managers have to recognize that 
</p>
<p>other stakeholders have their own objectives underlying their respective utility. 
</p>
<p>Under SRBV, the different  objectives  that the broad CSR literature considers are 
</p>
<p>split up across the different stakeholders and the manager should recognize other 
</p>
<p>M.S. Sodhi and C.S. Tang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>471
</p>
<p>stakeholders&rsquo;  objectives   into their respective utility. Understanding utility by 
</p>
<p>stakeholder allows the manager to focus on and differentiate stakeholder-specifi c 
</p>
<p>drivers of utility-maximizing effort. 
</p>
<p> The third question was how companies can be socially responsible by working 
</p>
<p>directly with the weaker members of society, the &lsquo;poor&rsquo;, who comprise the majority 
</p>
<p>in every society. The poor, if part of the company&rsquo;s supply chain as suppliers, dis-
</p>
<p>tributors, or consumers or even as members of communities where the company has 
</p>
<p>supply chain operations may be stakeholders. If their utility (or disutility) is affected 
</p>
<p>by the company&rsquo;s operations&mdash;indirectly by the managers&rsquo; decisions&mdash;then the poor 
</p>
<p>are stakeholders. Developing their capabilities may be part of or get aligned with the 
</p>
<p>managers&rsquo; efforts to develop their company&rsquo;s capabilities. However, philanthropic 
</p>
<p>efforts unrelated to the company&rsquo;s operations are not included in SRBV. This is 
</p>
<p>because the intended benefi ciaries of philanthropic may not be stakeholders whose 
</p>
<p>utility depends signifi cantly on a company&rsquo;s operations. Still, there is a grey area if 
</p>
<p>the  philanthropic effort   is considered useful for marketing purpose. 
</p>
<p> The last question for managers was  deciding   whether to or how to develop over-
</p>
<p>arching frameworks to  guide   a company&rsquo;s strategy to incorporate social responsibility. 
</p>
<p>SRBV provides such a framework that enables decision-making consistent with util-
</p>
<p>ity theory, resource-based view and stakeholder theory. Concepts like &lsquo;shared value&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>are rendered more tangible under SRBV in terms of increasing utility for the manag-
</p>
<p>ers themselves, their shareholders, and their suppliers or the communities in which 
</p>
<p>these suppliers have operations. Using SRBV, a manager can have a long- term view 
</p>
<p>focusing on developing his/her company&rsquo;s capabilities (dynamic capabilities, 
</p>
<p>resources and routines) as well as those of the company&rsquo;s stakeholders by extension.   
</p>
<p>21.3     Related Findings and Practical Implications 
</p>
<p> We fi nd many operations and supply chain confi gurations being tried by different 
</p>
<p>organizations mainly targeting economic improvement of the poor. These organiza-
</p>
<p>tions are mostly social enterprises rather than large companies. As such, we discuss 
</p>
<p>our fi ndings specifi cally for social enterprises fi rst in Sect.  21.3.1 . Next, we discuss 
</p>
<p>our fi ndings related to the poor as suppliers (Sect.  21.3.2 ), as distributors 
</p>
<p>(Sect.  21.3.3 ), and as borrowers of working capital lending specifi cally targeting 
</p>
<p>them (Sect.  21.3.4 ). This sets the stage for us to discuss implications for large 
</p>
<p> companies in Sect.  21.3.5 . 
</p>
<p>21.3.1      Social Enterprises 
</p>
<p> Sodhi and Tang ( 2011 ) view social  enterprises   as enabling the supply chains of 
</p>
<p>micro-entrepreneurs with the supply-chain perspective of material, information and 
</p>
<p>cashfl ows. Here are some examples of social enterprises: To lend to the poor, 
</p>
<p>21 Social Responsibility in Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>472
</p>
<p>Grameen Bank relies on group lending, SKS is a for-profi t organization that utilizes 
</p>
<p>capital markets to scale up its operations quickly, and Kiva is a person-to-person 
</p>
<p>online lending organization. 
</p>
<p> Then there are the enterprises that consider the poor as suppliers. For instance, 
</p>
<p>Arzu sells custom designed rugs made by Afghan women weavers. Thamel is an 
</p>
<p>online portal that allows diasporas to send gifts and money to their loved ones who 
</p>
<p>live in Nepal. Coconut World sells coconut sugar produced by the farmers in the 
</p>
<p>Philippines. Another example of a social enterprise is Ecomaximus that produces and 
</p>
<p>sells elephant dung paper that is co-produced by the villagers and their elephants in 
</p>
<p>Sri Lanka, and Men-on-the-Side-of-the-Road (MSR)&mdash;serves as an agent to help the 
</p>
<p>day laborers in South Africa to fi nd jobs in a safe and humane environment. 
</p>
<p> VisionSpring uses the poor as distributors. It procures cheap reading eyeglasses 
</p>
<p>and sells them through micro-entrepreneurs, thus providing affordable reading 
</p>
<p>glasses for low-income individuals with presbyopia. 
</p>
<p> Other social enterprises seek to help micro-entrepreneurs become more produc-
</p>
<p>tive. KickStart develops and sells mechanical irrigation pumps and cooking oil 
</p>
<p>presses so that the farmers can improve productivity. Solar Cooker allows villagers 
</p>
<p> to   start bakery businesses in areas that do not have easy access to energy.  
</p>
<p>21.3.2      The Poor as Suppliers 
</p>
<p> A company may be able to buy goods from the poor directly at good prices and, at 
</p>
<p>the same time, be seen as contributing towards poverty alleviation. In developing 
</p>
<p>countries, social enterprises and companies can help the poor as suppliers by using 
</p>
<p>three basic models:
</p>
<p>    1.     Reducing intermediate echelons to obtain higher selling prices :  Farmers   and other 
</p>
<p>small producers in developing countries typically sell their output through layers 
</p>
<p>of middlemen and consequently get low prices for their product. This creates an 
</p>
<p>opportunity for social enterprises or companies to help the poor by purchasing 
</p>
<p>their output directly. For example, Coconut World purchases coconut sugar made 
</p>
<p>by small farmers in the Philippines directly, and then sells directly to consumers 
</p>
<p>through its online store and to other retailers in the US (Cameranesi et al.  2010 ). 
</p>
<p>Walmart purchases the crops directly from farmers in China to reduce its costs; the 
</p>
<p>farmers also benefi t by getting a higher price (An et al. 2012). The social enterprise 
</p>
<p>Arzu purchases wool rugs directly from Afghan women and sells these in the 
</p>
<p>US. Organizations such as Fairtrade certify such direct purchase from the farmer 
</p>
<p>by manufacturers and retailers. Doing so enables these manufacturers and retailers 
</p>
<p>to advertise to (largely) western consumers that the company is working to ensure 
</p>
<p>the farmer gets a higher price than he would get from middlemen.   
</p>
<p>   2.     Reducing search cost:  The poor as suppliers do not have an easy way to search for 
</p>
<p>customers  for   their products or services. In South Africa, Men-on-the-Side-of- 
</p>
<p>the-Road (MSR) developed an online portal as a marketplace for day laborers 
</p>
<p>M.S. Sodhi and C.S. Tang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>473
</p>
<p> (micro-entrepreneurs) and homeowners, which helps laborers and potential cus-
</p>
<p>tomers fi nd each other (Sodhi and Tang  2011 ). Likewise, truck owners in India or 
</p>
<p>South Africa are typically micro-entrepreneurs with a single vehicle, private enter-
</p>
<p>prises have created websites offering to match loads from shippers with trucks to 
</p>
<p>help reduce the problem of trucks heading back home empty after delivery, e.g., 
</p>
<p>LoadJunction.com in India or 123LoadBoard in South Africa. Chipchase et al. 
</p>
<p>( 2006 ) reports that customer demand information available on the mobile phones 
</p>
<p>has helped taxi drivers to increase their earnings in Pakistan and Thailand. The same 
</p>
<p>has been reported for fi shermen in Kerala seeking markets for fi sh, a perishable 
</p>
<p>product because of the fi shermen&rsquo;s lack of access  to   cold chain facilities (Jensen 
</p>
<p> 2007 ). A broader question is that of the value of information. For instance, Chen and 
</p>
<p>Tang ( 2015 ) analytically obtain conditions under which use of (free) public or 
</p>
<p>(costly) private information can be benefi cial to a smallholder farmer or not.   
</p>
<p>   3.     Improving productivity : The poor, especially small farmers, often lack relevant 
</p>
<p>information to improve  productivity   and to increase selling opportunities. 
</p>
<p>In India, IFFCO disseminates information about weather forecasts and crop 
</p>
<p>advisory information (what to cultivate, when to harvest, and how to improve 
</p>
<p>yield and quality) to farmers via mobile phones so that they can plan their farm-
</p>
<p>ing activities accordingly (Ghosal and Parbat  2012 ). Also, Reuters Market Light 
</p>
<p>(RML) tracks the prices of 50 commodities over 1000 markets and the weather 
</p>
<p>conditions of 2000 locations and disseminates crop- and location-specifi c infor-
</p>
<p>mation to subscribed farmers in India using SMS text messages so that farmers 
</p>
<p>can sell their products at a higher price (Preethi  2009 ).      
</p>
<p>21.3.3      The Poor as Distributors 
</p>
<p> In developing countries, the  distribution   infrastructure is inadequate. A social enter-
</p>
<p>prise or a company can help reducing distribution cost by using micro-entrepreneurs 
</p>
<p>as distributors. For example, Mozambique-based VidaGas uses micro- entrepreneurs 
</p>
<p>to sell propane gas to food-stall owners, fi shermen, health clinics, etc. (Watson and 
</p>
<p>Kraiselburd  2009 ). Vision Spring sells affordable reading glasses to low-income 
</p>
<p>individuals through a network of micro-entrepreneurs in developing countries 
</p>
<p>(Bhattacharya et al.  2010 ). Social enterprises like Living Goods and Solar Sisters, 
</p>
<p>both operating in Uganda, also use women micro-entrepreneurs to do last-mile dis-
</p>
<p>tribution of household necessities and solar lamps respectively thus emulating the 
</p>
<p>model of the famed Avon Ladies (Economist  2012 ). 
</p>
<p> The basic distribution  strategy   entailing the poor as distributors is a  hub-and- 
</p>
<p>spoke  strategy. An enterprise can set up a center in a larger village as a &ldquo;hub&rdquo; from 
</p>
<p>which micro-entrepreneurs (or employees) can travel to the more remote rural areas 
</p>
<p>as &ldquo;spokes&rdquo; to sell goods or provide services. Such a distribution network can fur-
</p>
<p>ther benefi t from (a) using existing commercial/non-commercial networks for mov-
</p>
<p>ing goods to the micro-entrepreneurs or (b) providing additional services at the hub 
</p>
<p>or sell more products or services to create more supply chain surplus. 
</p>
<p>21 Social Responsibility in Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>474
</p>
<p> Providing  additional   services is a  piggyback  strategy. Gramin Suvidha Kendra, 
</p>
<p>a private&ndash;public partnership between MCX and Indian Post Offi ce established in 
</p>
<p>2006, distributes seeds, fertilizers, water purifi ers, micronutrients and solar lanterns 
</p>
<p>to farmers via the ubiquitous post offi ces in India (Vachani and Smith  2008 ). In 
</p>
<p>Africa, Cola Life, an independent UK charity, has used a wedge-shaped container 
</p>
<p>that fi ts between the Coca Cola bottles in their crates to reduce distribution costs 
</p>
<p>(see   www.colalife.org    ).  
</p>
<p>21.3.4      Working Capital Lending for the Poor as Suppliers 
</p>
<p>or Distributors 
</p>
<p> Micro- entrepreneurs      have very little access to credit from traditional banks not only 
</p>
<p>because of lack of credit history or collateral but also because of the small amounts of 
</p>
<p>money involved relative to the transaction cost for the bank for screening and collec-
</p>
<p>tion. Therefore, social enterprises and companies can fi nd ways to fi nance the working 
</p>
<p>capital if they are to engage the poor as suppliers or distributors. For example, as 
</p>
<p>already noted, Vision Spring provides each micro-entrepreneur in its supply chain with 
</p>
<p>$75 worth of eye charts, brochures, and a stock of reading glasses. In general, there are 
</p>
<p>different types of microfi nance models for micro-entrepreneurs to obtain micro-loans:
</p>
<p>    1.     Self-help groups (SHG)/Rotating Savings and Credits Associations (ROSCAs).  A 
</p>
<p>community of the poor can form self-help groups, where all members bring sav-
</p>
<p>ings to weekly (or monthly) meetings, and one of the members can take a loan 
</p>
<p>from these savings (Ardener  1995 ; Snow  1999 ). While this approach cannot be 
</p>
<p>used for working capital funding, it might be useful for a micro-entrepreneur to 
</p>
<p>purchase capital goods like a bicycle.   
</p>
<p>   2.     Community banks.  These banks seek to stimulate economic development (in 
</p>
<p>terms of business and job creation) for their communities. Grameen Bank uses 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;group lending&rdquo; to reduce its screening, monitoring and collection costs: all 
</p>
<p>members in a group are responsible to provide the repayment when one of the 
</p>
<p>members is behind (Foroohar  2010 ). Benefi ts of group lending can be extended 
</p>
<p>for working capital funding if all members of the group are suppliers or distribu-
</p>
<p>tors in the same supply chain and both materials and cash fl ows can be aggre-
</p>
<p>gated at the group level.   
</p>
<p>   3.     Peer-to-Peer Networks.  Kiva is a person-to-person online lending organization that 
</p>
<p>enables people in developed countries to provide micro-loans (Flannery  2007 ). So 
</p>
<p>this could be used for funding micro-entrepreneurs wishing to be suppliers or dis-
</p>
<p>tributors, but more for investment  in      capital goods rather than working capital.   
</p>
<p>   4.     Commercial MFIs : SKS is a for-profi t, publicly traded microfi nance organiza-
</p>
<p>tion in India that uses capital markets to scale up its operations quickly and uses 
</p>
<p>information technology to reduce operating cost (Akula  2008 ). Such a system 
</p>
<p>could also be useful for working capital funding if micro-entrepreneurs can keep 
</p>
<p>rotating balances.

<p>21.3.5        Practical Implications for Large Companies 
</p>
<p>  Large companies   seeking for ways to discharge their social responsibility can learn 
</p>
<p>from social responsibility can learn from social enterprises. Indeed, a company can 
</p>
<p>offer all three types of benefi ts to the poor as suppliers&mdash;reducing the number of 
</p>
<p>intermediate echelons, reducing search costs for selling products/services and 
</p>
<p>improving their productivity&mdash;by exploiting both supply chain structure and infor-
</p>
<p>mation technology. 
</p>
<p> Consider Indian consumer-goods giant ITC&rsquo;s e-Choupal initiative: ITC provides 
</p>
<p>farmers the historical selling prices of different crops at different locations on its 
</p>
<p>web portal, and ITC pre-announces its own price for purchasing the crops directly 
</p>
<p>from the farmers before the market opens the next day. These smallholder farmers 
</p>
<p>are least aware of a fl oor price when bringing their produce to ITC or to a commod-
</p>
<p>ity marketplace (Anupindi and Sivakumar  2006 ,  2007 ; Goyal  2010 ). 
</p>
<p> Companies can also use the poor as distributors. One example is Coca Cola in 
</p>
<p>East Africa, where bottlers deliver over $500 million worth of product to 1800 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;manual&rdquo; distribution centers operated by 7500 micro-entrepreneurs. There micro- 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurs use push carts or even bicycles to distribute the product to small 
</p>
<p>retailers (who are also micro-entrepreneurs) in congested areas, making frequent 
</p>
<p>but small deliveries to these cash-strapped micro-retailers. Another examples is 
</p>
<p>Hindustan Unilever, a subsidiary of Unilever in India, that started Project Shakti in 
</p>
<p>50 villages in 2000 with woman-entrepreneurs receiving training and stocks of 
</p>
<p>consumer- packaged goods from Unilever&rsquo;s rural distributor to sell the goods to con-
</p>
<p>sumers and micro-retailers in 6&ndash;10 villages (Rangan and Rajan  2007 ). 
</p>
<p> Finally, companies can offer microfi nance as working capital for the poor as sup-
</p>
<p>pliers or distributors, e.g., by pre-paying for supplies from the poor. Collection costs 
</p>
<p>are also reduced because collection can piggyback on the transfer of goods. Lending 
</p>
<p>transaction costs are greatly reduced if we tie micro-lending to the actual transac-
</p>
<p>tion. Moreover, aggregation of suppliers or distributors can fi t the group-lending 
</p>
<p>model well as we already noted. A practical way would be  to   provide micro- retailers 
</p>
<p>inventory on credit till the end of the day: the micro-retailer would effectively get 
</p>
<p>credit for the day and the company would limit its risk to the value of 1 day&rsquo;s inven-
</p>
<p>tory (Sodhi and Tang  2014 ). Or, a company like ITC could lend to farmers before 
</p>
<p>the sowing season and then gets its money back by receiving the produce when the 
</p>
<p>farmer brings produce to ITC directly or receiving cash when he sells his produce 
</p>
<p>on the Mandi.   
</p>
<p>21.4     Future Research 
</p>
<p> Integrating social responsibility into operations and supply chain management prac-
</p>
<p>tice using SRBV provides many opportunities for socially responsible operations 
</p>
<p>and for future research. This is because, as SRBV makes explicit, the researcher can 
</p>
<p>21 Social Responsibility in Supply Chains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>476
</p>
<p>choose any subset of stakeholders for study and suggest norms for their choices 
</p>
<p>rather than take the viewpoint of only a company&rsquo;s managers. Below are some of 
</p>
<p>these opportunities. 
</p>
<p>21.4.1     Developing Case Studies 
</p>
<p> There is shortage of well- researched   case studies or even descriptions of different 
</p>
<p>operation settings detailing how different groups of stakeholders became better off 
</p>
<p>(or not) because of the operations. One research question can be about the type of 
</p>
<p>operations and how these operations are being economically sustained: What&rsquo;s the 
</p>
<p>business model and where&rsquo;s the money? Implicitly, this research question can 
</p>
<p>include research objectives tied to  value creation  and  value delivery  (London et al. 
</p>
<p> 2010 ) and  value sharing  (say between micro-entrepreneurs and the corporation as 
</p>
<p>between farmers and ITC in the latter&rsquo;s e-Choupal project). Sodhi and Tang (2012) 
</p>
<p>attempt to understand how the supply chains of individual micro-entrepreneurs can 
</p>
<p>be strengthened by social enterprises, and examine the economic sustenance of such 
</p>
<p>operation. Phenomenological investigation by way of fi eld study and ethnography 
</p>
<p>would be quite useful as a foundation for further research. 
</p>
<p> One aspect of such studies could lead to better understanding of the multi-way 
</p>
<p>partnership and factors behind success/failure for particular operations by way of, 
</p>
<p>say, local communities, NGOs and the regional government working or not 
</p>
<p> working together. Unanticipated  side effects  of seemingly socially responsible 
</p>
<p>operations would stem from studying a wider set of stakeholders. For instance, 
</p>
<p>donated clothes can have a detrimental impact on the local apparel and retail indus-
</p>
<p>try, as seen in Africa. Looking at a wider set of stakeholders, as with SRBV, can 
</p>
<p>help anticipate &lsquo;side effects&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p> Research in social irresponsibility beyond excellent journalism is limited. The 
</p>
<p>problem of large companies setting up elaborate operations to avoid taxes is not 
</p>
<p>new (Christensen and Murphy  2004 ) and may even be considered desirable by man-
</p>
<p>agers rather than being &lsquo;socially irresponsible&rsquo;. But there are other instances of 
</p>
<p>well-documented irresponsible behaviour by corporations. Armstrong ( 1977 ), using 
</p>
<p>behavioural experiments, suggests  the   problem of  irresponsible  behaviour among 
</p>
<p>managers may be widespread and is possibly linked to &lsquo;stockholder&rsquo; perspective 
</p>
<p>such as that advocated by Friedman ( 1970 ).  
</p>
<p>21.4.2     Social Enterprise 
</p>
<p> Social  entrepreneurship   offers an appealing proposition&mdash;making money by doing 
</p>
<p>good. There are several topics that merit further study such as appropriate supply 
</p>
<p>chain and other performance measures for social enterprises working with micro-
</p>
<p>entrepreneurs; supply chain coordination and collaboration between social enter-
</p>
<p>prises and other organizations; how mutually created value is shared between the 
</p>
<p>M.S. Sodhi and C.S. Tang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>477
</p>
<p>social enterprise and its micro-entrepreneurs; and support of government policy for 
</p>
<p>social enterprises.  
</p>
<p>21.4.3     Better Understanding of the Poor 
</p>
<p> There are plenty of opportunities to research the decision making of the poor in 
</p>
<p>emerging markets. For instance, as feature mobile phone penetration rate exceeds 
</p>
<p>90 % in India, companies such as Reuters Market Light (RML) and Nokia are offer-
</p>
<p>ing information services to farmers (cf. Chen and Tang  2015 ). Some key issues to 
</p>
<p>investigate include identifying the key drivers for farmers as regards paying for 
</p>
<p>subscription, how farmers use the information in practice to make farming deci-
</p>
<p>sions, and whether or not such market information actually helps farmers earn more. 
</p>
<p>  Mobile-based fi nance   has been considered as a major breakthrough to help the 
</p>
<p>poor-conduct fi nancial transactions (savings, loans, remittances, loan repayments, 
</p>
<p>payments) over the mobile phones (Lee and Tang  2012 ). One area of study could be 
</p>
<p>how mobile fi nance services with instant access change the spending and savings 
</p>
<p>habits of the poor.  
</p>
<p>21.4.4     Impact Studies 
</p>
<p> Measuring the alleviation of the targeted social problem across different time frames 
</p>
<p>and scopes requires fi eld study by way of so-called &lsquo;impact&rsquo; studies. Current studies 
</p>
<p>do not have consistent results. For instance, Mittal et al. ( 2010 ) fi nds that farmers 
</p>
<p>subscribing to market information via mobile phones enjoyed higher income, while 
</p>
<p>Fafchamps and Minten ( 2012 ) fi nd no evidence supporting this claim. There is room 
</p>
<p>for analytical models here too: Chen and Tang ( 2015 ) show that that more accurate 
</p>
<p>market information can have a detrimental effect to prices and therefore to farmers&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>wellbeing. Incidentally, studies of stock performance are not uncommon. Frooman 
</p>
<p>( 1997 ) does a meta-analysis of event studies to examine the impact of socially 
</p>
<p>responsible announcements on the stock performance of a fi rm&mdash;similar work could 
</p>
<p>be done with not only companies&rsquo; but also other stakeholders&rsquo; performance.  
</p>
<p>21.4.5      Monitoring Suppliers   
</p>
<p> Companies that face consumers directly do not wish to be associated in the media 
</p>
<p>with such problems at their suppliers as child labour or poor work conditions of 
</p>
<p>workers. How should companies monitor and motivate their suppliers? Porteous 
</p>
<p>et al. ( 2015 ) analyse the responses from practitioners at 334 companies and report 
</p>
<p>that incentives for suppliers rather than penalties are strongly associated with a 
</p>
<p>reduction in the company&rsquo;s violations and operating costs.

</p>
<p>21.4.6     Understanding the Role of Markets and Government 
</p>
<p>in Improving Social Welfare 
</p>
<p> As groundwater or other  natural   resources get depleted, trading on the market is 
</p>
<p>considered as the best possible solution. But does it actually work? Murali et al. 
</p>
<p>( 2015 ) show that exporting water through a water market with exogenous price is 
</p>
<p>detrimental to both society and the environment within the community if we con-
</p>
<p>sider &lsquo;triple bottom line benefi ts&rsquo;. Their work generalizes to other commodities as 
</p>
<p>well: consider for instance, India&rsquo;s ban on export of cotton in 2012 and a 30 % tax 
</p>
<p>to discourage export of iron ore in 2011. Also, different parties may not actually 
</p>
<p>participate in the market. For instance, a signifi cant amount of waste currently going 
</p>
<p>to landfi ll or incinerators could potentially be re-purposed. Dhanorkar et al. ( 2015 ) 
</p>
<p>consider why such exchanges have had limited take-up. Their work has  implications 
</p>
<p>beyond such exchanges to those of manpower such as Men-on-the-Side-of-  the-
</p>
<p>Road in S. Africa and freight-boards for truck transportation in Africa or Asia as 
</p>
<p>there may be similar factors affecting lack of take-up. 
</p>
<p> How should government balance different interests? This is an important 
</p>
<p>research topic. Park et al. ( 2015 ) consider social welfare stemming from optimal 
</p>
<p>application of carbon taxes with retailers seeking to maximize profi t and consumers 
</p>
<p>seeking to maximize utility and show that the government will fi nd carbon taxes 
</p>
<p>more effective as  the   competition becomes higher.  
</p>
<p>21.4.7     Improving the Lot of Smallholder Farmers 
</p>
<p>in Developing Countries 
</p>
<p> Tang and Zhou ( 2012 ), Chen et al. ( 2013 ), Devalkar et al. ( 2011 ) and McCoy ( 2012 ) 
</p>
<p>provide welcome fi rst steps for further research in this area. Aggregating  smallholder 
</p>
<p>farmers via   cooperative or other aggregations has attracted the attention of policy-
</p>
<p>makers, those interested in social development and certainly many OM researchers 
</p>
<p>(Chen et al.  2015 ). But are these always benefi cial for farmers? An et al. ( 2015 ) fi nd 
</p>
<p>that cooperatives (or other aggregations) of smallholder farmers are not necessarily 
</p>
<p>a silver bullet relative to farmers who choose not to join the cooperative. 
</p>
<p> One way to develop resources for smallholder farmers is online or telephone 
</p>
<p>forums. But how should such forums be designed and operated? For a forum with 
</p>
<p>experts and (some) knowledgeable farmers, Chen et al. ( 2015 ) use game-theoretic 
</p>
<p>analysis to show that knowledgeable farmers never provide answers that are more 
</p>
<p>informative than the experts in equilibrium. Chen and Tang ( 2015 ) show that the 
</p>
<p>value of private information providers such as RML in India decreases as public 
</p>
<p>information services improve. 
</p>
<p> In this context, studying how to optimize different types of supply contracts 
</p>
<p>(e.g., wholesale price, revenue sharing, or profi t sharing) with a view to poverty 
</p>
<p>alleviation as well as profi ts for the enterprise would be useful. These contracts 
</p>
<p>M.S. Sodhi and C.S. Tang</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>479
</p>
<p>would include supporting the micro-entrepreneurs&rsquo; need for capital, say, farmers 
</p>
<p>having to buy equipment, seed, or fertilizer. The role of the wholesale auction 
</p>
<p>markets in India called  mandis  also needs to be better understood as to how  the 
</p>
<p>  government can achieve its objectives optimally.  
</p>
<p>21.4.8     Distribution Models Using the Poor 
</p>
<p> Effi cient distribution  strategies   for enabling micro-entrepreneurs in developing 
</p>
<p>countries to buy, distribute, and sell products have not been studied much. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>for  piggyback distribution , it is not clear how the value created should be shared 
</p>
<p>between the network owner and the enterprise or micro-entrepreneurs. For example, 
</p>
<p>how much should Coca Cola charge Cola Life for distributing its AidPods? How 
</p>
<p>much should India Post charge Gramin Suvidha Kendra? Inventory issues arising 
</p>
<p>from a hub-and-spoke system with many micro-entrepreneurs as spokes provide 
</p>
<p>interesting research opportunities. For example, a hub-based inventory at a central-
</p>
<p>ized warehouse reduces the inventory due to the &ldquo;pooling&rdquo; effect, but makes it 
</p>
<p>costly for the micro-entrepreneurs to replenish their inventories especially if they 
</p>
<p>have to do so frequently owing to limited purchasing power. Involving local entre-
</p>
<p>preneurs as informal sales force in developing countries creates new research 
</p>
<p>opportunities to extend the existing marketing and the OM literature in the area of 
</p>
<p>sales force planning, sales territory design, and incentive design (Lilien et al.  1992 ).  
</p>
<p>21.4.9     Working Capital Lending to the Poor 
</p>
<p> Economists have  studied   microfi nance since the early 1990s (cf. Armend&aacute;riz and 
</p>
<p>Morduch  2007 ) and there are different economic theories on group lending&mdash;see 
</p>
<p>and for comprehensive reviews. One research opportunity lies in testing the assump-
</p>
<p>tion of risk reduction in group-lending. The same could be applied to micro-entre-
</p>
<p>preneurs as distributors when provided with goods on inventory on a credit basis. 
</p>
<p>Another research opportunity deals with optimal loan repayment: frequent repay-
</p>
<p>ment schedule reduces the amount of defaulted loans but it increases the lenders&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>cost of collection. A third research opportunity is screening micro-entrepreneurs for 
</p>
<p>lending to reduce the cost associated with default loans. Developing effective way 
</p>
<p>to develop new credit  scoring methods by analyzing the data captured by the fi nan-
</p>
<p>cial transactions (remittances, loan repayments, payments) conducted over the 
</p>
<p>mobile phones (Lee and Tang  2012 ) may be a practical way to carry out such 
</p>
<p>research. Researchers have also used Kiva&rsquo;s online portal to examine how this infor-
</p>
<p>mation on fi nancial transactions would affect lending behaviour among online lend-
</p>
<p>ers (Hartley et al.  2010 ). This can be specialized to screening for distributors 
</p>
<p>especially when the goods are being  provided   on credit.

</p>
<p>22.1          Introduction 
</p>
<p> Sustainability issues are so immense that no single organization can face them 
</p>
<p>alone. Global business, in order to deal with the pressure coming from governments 
</p>
<p>and society, seeks to better manage their supply chains with regard to social and 
</p>
<p>environmental impacts, and contribute to society. They often work with multiple 
</p>
<p>stakeholders such as NGOs, through cross-sector partnerships. Many examples of 
</p>
<p>cross-sector partnership-based initiatives exist such as the TNT and World Food 
</p>
<p>Program partnership, or the partnership between the humanitarian Logistics Cluster 
</p>
<p>and logistics companies (Stadtler and Van Wassenhove  2013 ). 
</p>
<p> This chapter focuses on how supply chains can be used to create sustainable 
</p>
<p>value through cross-sector collaboration. The objective of this chapter is twofold. 
</p>
<p>First, we conduct a case study research by using three examples of cross-sector 
</p>
<p>partnerships to identify challenges that arise in the process of value creation. 
</p>
<p>Second, we discuss how these challenges could be addressed by using Operations 
</p>
<p>Management (OM)/Supply Chain Management (SCM) research. 
</p>
<p> To achieve the fi rst objective, we select three examples of cross-sector partner-
</p>
<p>ships between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare focused NGOs, since we 
</p>
<p>had the opportunity to follow their development over more than 1 year and they 
</p>
<p>provide good illustrative examples of typical challenges. The  pharmaceutical indus-
</p>
<p>try   has been growing rapidly for the past decades, saturating developed markets, 
</p>
<p>and exploring growth opportunities in emerging markets. Health supply chains in 
</p>
<p>emerging markets face a number of challenges that require local market knowledge

<p>like retail distribution and pricing. Collaboration with NGOs can help pharmaceuti-
</p>
<p>cal companies improve their corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance and 
</p>
<p>close their local knowledge gap, while at the same time support healthcare systems 
</p>
<p>in developing countries. From a supply chain management perspective, the private 
</p>
<p>partners may engage in cross-sector partnerships in order to assess the potential of 
</p>
<p>developing markets, build their reputation and motivate their employees. 
</p>
<p> The fi rst case involves the Janssen Pharmaceutica haematology department unit of 
</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, a multinational medical devices, pharmaceutical, and consumer 
</p>
<p>packaged goods manufacturer. The other two of our three cases involve Tibotec, a 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical company belonging to the Johnson &amp; Johnson group, with a focus on 
</p>
<p>research and development for treatment of  infectious diseases  . The fi rst partnership 
</p>
<p>was built between Johnson &amp; Johnson and International HIV/AIDS Alliance in 
</p>
<p>Zambia, the second between Tibotec and International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Ukraine, 
</p>
<p>and the third between Tibotec and International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Uganda. 
</p>
<p>International HIV/AIDS Alliance 1  is a global partnership of nationally based govern-
</p>
<p>mental and non-governmental organizations that support community organizations in 
</p>
<p>addressing HIV/AIDS issues in developing countries. 
</p>
<p> All three cases were part of an  Executive Development Programme (EDP)   run by 
</p>
<p>INSEAD, a global business school and PEPAL, a global foundation that fosters part-
</p>
<p>nerships between businesses and nonprofi t organizations to achieve scalable and sus-
</p>
<p>tainable social change in developing and emerging markets 2 . Hence the NGOs 
</p>
<p>participated in the  EDP  , together with business executives, in order to get exposed to 
</p>
<p>supply chain and other management-related tools that would help them improve their 
</p>
<p>skills. This program was implemented in collaboration with the International HIV/
</p>
<p>AIDS Alliance (IHAA) headquarters and its regional partner organizations that took 
</p>
<p>part in the program. The EDP involved two 1-week sessions of executive training at 
</p>
<p>INSEAD, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the program and a 1-year 
</p>
<p>project in-between aiming to address challenges identifi ed by NGO participants. 
</p>
<p> The chapter is organized as follows. In Sect.  22.2 , we present an overview of lit-
</p>
<p>erature on supply chain, cross-sector partnerships and introduce a theoretical frame-
</p>
<p>work depicting factors that affect partnership success. Section  22.3  describes the 
</p>
<p>three cases. Section  22.4  uses the framework to analyze the case studies, summarizes 
</p>
<p>the main fi ndings and practical implications and discusses possible avenues for value 
</p>
<p>creation using OM/SCM research. Finally, Sect.  22.5  presents our conclusions.  
</p>

</p>
<p> In order to address our question&mdash;what are the challenges affecting the success of 
</p>
<p>cross-sector partnerships in value creation for the partners&mdash;we fi rst consider the 
</p>
<p>supply chain partnership literature. According to the Supply Chain Management

<p>Institute &ldquo; supply chain management   is the management of relationships in the net-
</p>
<p>work of organizations, from end customers through original suppliers, using key 
</p>
<p>cross-functional business processes to create value for customers and other stake-
</p>
<p>holders&rdquo; (Lambert  2014 ). 
</p>
<p> Supply chain partnerships develop through different levels (Lambert  2014 ). At 
</p>
<p>the fi rst level, the partners articulate their objectives. At the second level, the part-
</p>
<p>ners need to align their expectations by setting the partnership&rsquo;s objectives and then 
</p>
<p>at the third level they develop the action plan and assign responsibilities. When the 
</p>
<p>action plan is implemented, the partners review performance (fourth level) against 
</p>
<p>expectations in order to decide how to proceed with the partnership. 
</p>
<p> In the case of cross-sector partnerships, private companies typically engage in 
</p>
<p>such collaborations in order to improve their reputation, motivate their employees, 
</p>
<p>and develop or assess potential markets (Maon et al.  2009 ), while the NGOs&rsquo; driv-
</p>
<p>ers are the opportunity to increase their resources and the exposure to SCM and 
</p>
<p>management-related tools (Van Wassenhove  2006 ). Cross-sector partnerships refer 
</p>
<p>to the partnerships that involve government, business, nonprofi ts and philanthro-
</p>
<p>pies, communities, and/or the public as a whole (Bryson et al.  2006 ; Cooper et al. 
</p>
<p> 2006 ; Austin and Seitanidi  2012a ,  b ). Figure  22.1  presents the cross-sector supply 
</p>
<p>chain partnership.
</p>
<p>   The supply chain partnership model was originally built to describe business-to- 
</p>
<p>business collaborations. While partnerships between private companies face multi-
</p>
<p>ple challenges, like incentive misalignment or information asymmetry, these 
</p>
<p>challenges are even more complex in the case of cross-sector supply chain partner-
</p>
<p>ships. Health management in developing countries faces a lot of uncertainty due to 
</p>
<p>constraints in funding and skills of the people employed (Thomas  2005 ; Gustavsson 
</p>
<p> 2003 ). Hence, NGOs often do not have the necessary resources to acknowledge the 
</p>
<p>importance of supply chain management, regarding it as an auxiliary function 
</p>
<p>(Arminas  2005 ). While the partnership model provides a good understanding of the 
</p>
<p>private supply chain partnership, it ignores the complex environment of cross- sector 
</p>
<p>collaboration. For this reason, we consult literature on cross-sector collaboration 
</p>
<p>between business and nonprofi t organizations. 
</p>
<p> A clear difference between the typical partnership model, described by Lambert 
</p>
<p>( 2014 ), and a cross-sector partnership is that private partnerships are seen as static 
</p>
<p>while Austin ( 2000a ,  b ) argues there are three stages of  collaboration   in cross-sector 
</p>
<p>partnerships: philanthropic (unilateral transfer of resources), transactional (recipro-
</p>
<p>cal exchange of resources), and integrative (based on a very close organizational 
</p>

</p>
<p>coordination and co-creation of value). Austin and Seitanidi ( 2012b ) build on the 
</p>
<p>work of Austin ( 2000a ,  b ) and suggest collaboration may evolve to a fourth trans-
</p>
<p>formative stage (aimed to co-create change at the societal level). This implies that 
</p>
<p>cross-sector partnerships are dynamically evolving over time based on the nature, 
</p>
<p>intensity, and form of interaction. 
</p>
<p> No matter at which stage partners commence their collaboration, they go through 
</p>
<p>several phases. Selsky and Parker ( 2005 ) distinguish three phases of partnership 
</p>
<p> lifecycle  : (1) formation, (2) implementation and (3) outcomes, looking at project- 
</p>
<p>based cross-sector partnerships to address social issues. Austin and Seitanidi 
</p>
<p>( 2012b ) divide partnership lifecycle into the following phases: (1) partnership 
</p>
<p>selection and formation, and (2) partnership implementation and post-formation 
</p>
<p>management. Similarly, Kale and Singh ( 2009 ) suggest three phases of alliance: (1) 
</p>
<p>partner selection and alliance formation, (2) alliance governance and design and (3) 
</p>
<p>post-formation alliance management. The expected benefi ts should be articulated to 
</p>
<p>the partners and society (Austin et al.  2000 ) and, eventually, decide if the partner-
</p>
<p>ship should be continued or terminated. The processes describe how the actions and 
</p>
<p>the dynamics take place during the phases. Finally, the outcomes refl ect the value 
</p>
<p>created as the impact of the partnership. Measurement systems and key performance 
</p>
<p>indicators (KPIs) could be of help in achieving this. 
</p>
<p> Austin and Seitanidi ( 2012a ,  b ) argue that value of partnering originates from 
</p>
<p>resource complementarity, resource nature, resource directionality and use, and 
</p>
<p>linked interests. It eventually materializes into one of the following types of  values  : 
</p>
<p>associational, transferred resource, interaction, and synergetic. Associational value 
</p>
<p>is a consequent benefi t accruing to a partner from having a collaborative relation-
</p>
<p>ship with the other one. Transferred resource value arises by receiving a resource 
</p>
<p>from the other partner. Interaction value depicts the intangibles that derive from the 
</p>
<p>collaboration like communication or leadership skills. Synergistic value refl ects the 
</p>
<p>value that arises by combining partners&rsquo; resources; this value is higher than the one 
</p>
<p>that would be accomplished if they would have acted separately. 
</p>
<p> We use the literature on cross-sector partnerships and supply chain partnerships 
</p>
<p>to build a framework that will help us identify factors leading to successful cross- 
</p>
<p>sector partnerships. Specifi cally, we look into the literature for factors that infl uence 
</p>
<p>partnership formation and selection management, partnership implementation man-
</p>
<p>agement and outcomes. We also examine the managerial challenges and complex 
</p>
<p>environment in which these partnerships occur. 
</p>
<p> In Sects.  22.2.1  and  22.2.2  we focus on the two phases of partner selection and for-
</p>
<p>mation, and partnership implementation and post-formation management, respectively. 
</p>
<p>22.2.1      Partner Selection and Partnership Formation 
</p>
<p> Decisions at the partner  selection and formation   phase infl uence partnership&rsquo;s future 
</p>
<p>potential to evolve and create value. This phase allows partners to align expecta-
</p>
<p>tions and determine if a potential relationship is worth time and investment. It

</p>
<p>includes a range of activities such as problem-setting processes (Gray  1989 ; 
</p>
<p>McCann  1983 ), initial conditions of the partners, for example resources they  possess 
</p>
<p>(Bryson et al.  2006 ), and assessments indicating benefi ts likely to be produced by 
</p>
<p>the collaboration (Clarke and Fuller  2010 ; Gourville and Rangan  2004 ). As identi-
</p>
<p>fi ed by Lambert ( 2014 ) it is also crucial for the supply chain partnership to set 
</p>
<p>objectives and match expectations. 
</p>
<p> Austin and Seitanidi ( 2012b ) show that initial articulation of the problem, linked 
</p>
<p>interests and resources, partners&rsquo; motives (Seitanidi and Crane  2009 ) and missions, 
</p>
<p>history of past interactions and visibility fi t are key measures of partnership forma-
</p>
<p>tion and fi t potential. Visibility fi t refl ects the desire to gain visibility (Gourville and 
</p>
<p>Rangan  2004 ) that may enhance reputation (Tully  2004 ), and public image (Alsop 
</p>
<p> 2004 ; Heap  1998 ; Rondinelli and London  2003 ), which are benefi ts that can be 
</p>
<p>attributed to associational value. Visibility fi t is a very important aspect in Corporate 
</p>
<p>Social Responsibility (CSR)-based relationships. 
</p>
<p> One indicator of the potential for  value   creation is the identifi cation of linked 
</p>
<p>interests through the initial articulation of a social problem relevant to both partners 
</p>
<p>(Bryson et al.  2006 ; Gray  1989 ; Waddock  1986 ). Addressing the social problem 
</p>
<p>often becomes the key objective for the partnership itself. The process of articula-
</p>
<p>tion can be challenging and show the incompatibilities between partners signalling 
</p>
<p>the need for realignment (Austin and Seitanidi  2012b ). Moreover, when the social 
</p>
<p>problem is linked to the interests of the partners, the probability that they will ben-
</p>
<p>efi t from the partnership is higher (Le Ber and Branzei  2010 ). So matching the 
</p>
<p>interests of the partners shows that they better fi t with one another and may increase 
</p>
<p>partnership success. 
</p>
<p> Partners&rsquo; motives and missions reveal possible linked interests and expected 
</p>
<p>benefi ts (Seitanidi  2010 ). According to Kale and Singh ( 2009 ), partner complemen-
</p>
<p>tarity shows how partners contribute non-overlapping resources to the partnership 
</p>
<p>and it may include both tangible and intangible (knowledge, capabilities, manage-
</p>
<p>ment practices, and skills) resources. It also refers to the fi t between partner working 
</p>
<p>styles and cultures (Austin and Seitanidi  2012b ). Corporations willing to enter 
</p>
<p>developing regions have to understand the unique conditions of this environment 
</p>
<p>and try to fi t culturally (Dahan et al.  2010 ). Checking for compatibility and comple-
</p>
<p>mentarity early on, by verifying the past history of interactions and visibility fi t 
</p>
<p>(Austin and Seitanidi  2012b ), can reduce the probability of misunderstandings, 
</p>
<p> misallocation of costs and benefi ts, mismatches of power, lack of complementary 
</p>
<p>skills, and mistrust (Berger et al.  2004 ). Social partnerships are inherently fragile 
</p>
<p>also because of individuals involved in the collaboration for whom partnerships 
</p>
<p>may be of secondary concern when compared to their daily jobs (Waddock  1988 ). 
</p>
<p> Once the formation measures are set,  the   next step concerns the partner selection 
</p>
<p>using predefi ned partnership criteria and the measures of partnership formation and 
</p>
<p>fi t the potential discussed above. Specifi c criteria may involve factors such as the 
</p>
<p>industry of interest, resource availability, and scope of operations and may facilitate 
</p>
<p>the process of assessing potential partners. There are cases where some organiza-
</p>
<p>tions may not agree with all of the activities involved in the partnership formation 
</p>
<p>and selection process or some activities may overlap.

</p>
<p>22.2.2      Partnership Implementation and Post-Formation 
</p>
<p>Management 
</p>
<p> The implementation of  the   partnership commences when the needs and problems of 
</p>
<p>the partners are clear and the partnership is formed. At the beginning of this phase, 
</p>
<p>the partnership is designed and then the operations follow. Partnership design 
</p>
<p> processes include setting objectives and structures (Austin  2000b ; Bryson et al. 
</p>
<p> 2006 ; Googins and Rochlin  2000 ), rules and regulations (Das and Teng  1998 ; Gray 
</p>
<p> 1989 ), leadership positions (Austin  2000a ; Waddock  1986 ) and agreements on part-
</p>
<p>nership management (Seitanidi and Crane  2009 ). Moving from design to operations 
</p>
<p>is often followed by experimentation, adaption (Austin  2000a ; Gray  1989 ), opera-
</p>
<p>tionalization, and institutionalization of processes as partners improve and readjust 
</p>
<p>their coordination mechanisms and structural arrangements (Austin and Seitanidi 
</p>
<p> 2012b ).  This   process is facilitated by frequency in communication, professional 
</p>
<p>leadership, evaluation of progress, and the ability to set objectives (Googins and 
</p>
<p>Rochlin  2000 ; Austin and Seitanidi  2012b ). 
</p>
<p> While setting the objectives is an  important   factor for partnership success 
</p>
<p>(Googins and Rochlin  2000 ), rules and regulations can also emerge as partnership 
</p>
<p>evolves (Austin and Seitanidi  2012b ). Informal communication is more likely to 
</p>
<p>be effective in dealing with tensions between the partners and harmonizing differ-
</p>
<p>ent organizational cultures (Orlitzky et al.  2003 ). Austin and Seitanidi ( 2012b ) fi nd 
</p>
<p>by conducting a literature review that harmonizing two different organizational 
</p>
<p>cultures, leadership, forms of communication that enable trust, mutual respect, 
</p>
<p>openness, constructive criticism, and open dialogue play an important role in 
</p>
<p>cross-sector partnerships. Shah and Swaminathan ( 2008 ) emphasize that commit-
</p>
<p>ment is crucial for partnership success especially when partners have clear expec-
</p>
<p>tations from the partnership but vague processes regarding how to achieve them. In 
</p>
<p>this case, partners should be willing to dedicate more resources to the relationship 
</p>
<p>and pledge to work with each other even when they realize that some adaptation 
</p>
<p>might be required. 
</p>
<p> The value created by partnerships should then be measured. For example, a 
</p>
<p>group of companies, including pharmaceutical companies like, Abbott, AbbVie, 
</p>
<p>Astra Zeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, uses a framework to assess the real value and 
</p>
<p>impact of their  community investment   to both business and society. 3  Other prac-
</p>
<p>titioner studies, such as IFC, Community Investment Guidelines 4  and TPI, Current 
</p>
<p>Practice Evaluation 5 , provide guidelines on how to measure and communicate 
</p>
<p>community investment for strategic advantage. In this respect, Googins and

</p>
<p>Rochlin ( 2000 ) raise a question that is common among practitioners: how partners 
</p>
<p>can measure results of their partnerships. On an organizational level, by review-
</p>
<p>ing best practices of social programmes, Sept et al. ( 2011 ) proposes four methods 
</p>
<p>for evaluation: impact evaluation, performance monitoring, process evaluation, 
</p>
<p>and social return on investment evaluation. Koza and Lewin ( 2000 ) discuss the 
</p>
<p>importance of  monitoring performance outcomes  . Specifi cally, they fi nd that in 
</p>
<p>partnerships with less well-defi ned objectives such as exploration alliances, mon-
</p>
<p>itoring progress and performance outcomes, and setting clear partnership goals is 
</p>
<p>greatly complicated and requires the design and execution of process controls. 
</p>
<p>This often happens because the performance goals are generally stated in much 
</p>
<p>less specifi c, causally ambiguous, open-ended terms such as acquiring new capa-
</p>
<p>bilities and learning new technologies. Key performance indicators ( KPIs  )     can 
</p>
<p>  also be used to show whether the partnership is moving towards its objectives. At 
</p>
<p>that point, the partners need to decide if they should exit the partnership or develop 
</p>
<p>a continuation strategy. 
</p>
<p> The key processes of the  post-formation management and implementation phase   
</p>
<p>described above are used in our framework, presented in Fig.  22.2 . These processes 
</p>
<p>highlight also the challenges that partners may face at every phase, like lack of com-
</p>
<p>mitment, trust and an open relationship. The two phases are followed by the deci-
</p>
<p>sion to assess value created and to exit or continue the partnership (continuation 
</p>
<p>strategy). Hence the framework presented in Fig.  22.2  captures the factors that 
</p>
<p>according to the literature affect partnership success. In Sect.  22.3  we use this

<p>framework to analyze our three cases.

<p>22.3           Empirical Study: Case Description 
</p>
<p> In this section we present three case studies of partnerships between pharmaceuti-
</p>
<p>cal companies (headquartered in Belgium) and healthcare focused nonprofi t orga-
</p>
<p>nizations operating in developing countries. The three partnerships were built and 
</p>
<p>implemented in 2009&ndash;2010, during the 12 months Executive Development 
</p>
<p>Program (EDP) commissioned by PEPAL, a social enterprise and carried out by 
</p>
<p>the INSEAD Humanitarian Research Group. Using the framework, (Fig.  22.2 ) 
</p>
<p>developed in the previous section, we identify main challenges that arise in the 
</p>
<p>process of building and implementing the cross-sector partnerships and then we 
</p>
<p>compare the three partnerships. 
</p>
<p> Partnerships underwent several phases (Austin and Seitanidi  2012b ). First, a 
</p>
<p>partnership formation and selection phase took place during which, with assistance 
</p>
<p>of PEPAL, potential candidates were identifi ed and matched. PEPAL following 
</p>
<p> discussions with both NGO and private partners built a list of criteria to match the 
</p>
<p>partners. Thus the three partnerships were formed based on the skills of the private 
</p>
<p>partners, their previous collaboration experience, the mutual interests of both part-
</p>
<p>ners and the chemistry developed between the  individuals   forming the partnership. 
</p>
<p>Table  22.1  presents the partner selection criteria.
</p>
<p>   Second, partnership implementation and post-formation management followed, 
</p>
<p>throughout which partners carried out partnership management activities as part of 
</p>
<p>the 1-year program. Our three partnerships had no formal governance structure. The 
</p>
<p>collaboration was based on mutual trust and informal relationships. Lastly, the

<p> outcomes of the partnerships are also discussed looking at them as the result of the 
</p>
<p>collaboration rather than a separate phase. After 1 year, partners evaluated their 
</p>
<p>progress and outcomes, and made decisions with regard to the future of their col-
</p>
<p>laboration [the full cases can be found in Balaisyte and Van Wassenhove ( 2011 )]. 
</p>
<p> The structure of the mini-cases is as follows. We fi rst describe how the partnership 
</p>
<p>was formed. Then we briefl y discuss the evolution of the partnership. Finally we 
</p>
<p>summarize the challenges encountered and outcomes achieved by the partnership. 
</p>
<p>22.3.1     Case 1: Partnership in Zambia 
</p>
<p> Around 68 % of  Zambia  ns live below the recognized national poverty line (United 
</p>
<p>Nations Statistics Division  2014 ). The country is experiencing a generalized HIV/
</p>
<p>AIDS epidemic, with a national HIV prevalence rate of 17 % among adults, with the 
</p>
<p>NGO sector being a crucial player in providing health services to the community. 
</p>
<p>Lack of resources, capacity and training in the public sector for the healthcare ser-
</p>
<p>vices create demand for NGO services. 
</p>
<p>22.3.1.1     Formation of the Partnership 
</p>
<p> International HIV/AIDS Alliance  in   Zambia, established in 1999, has been a partner 
</p>
<p>organization for the Zambia Integrated Health Program (ZIHPCOMM) 6 . Since it 
</p>
<p>was founded, International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Zambia was challenged by 
</p>
<p>decentralization since it has grown with a need to make the transition from a coun-
</p>
<p>try offi ce of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance to a fully independent Zambian 
</p>
<p>NGO. Change management and capacity were required to handle this transition. 
</p>
<p>International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Zambia joined this EDP while seeking to ben-
</p>
<p>efi t from marketing expertise to build the image of the evolving organization, to 
</p>
<p>increase the available resources of its supply chain, and gain benefi ts through the 
</p>
<p>associational value (by improving its image) and interaction value (acquiring mar-
</p>
<p>keting skills from interaction). 
</p>
<p> At the same time, the private partner,    backed by its organization, was looking for 
</p>
<p>a 1-year engagement within an NGO operating in the healthcare sector. The private 
</p>
<p>partner had worked in the pharmaceutical industry for the past 10 years, mostly in 
</p>
<p>developed countries, and had extensive experience in the domains required by the 
</p>
<p>NGO. So the private partner could help the NGO improve the management skills of 
</p>
<p>employees and the NGO&rsquo;s operations and hence no longer regard their supply chain 
</p>
<p>as an auxiliary function (Arminas  2005 ). The private partner was interested to build 
</p>
<p>an understanding of how the healthcare system functions in a less developed con-
</p>
<p>text and how the pharmaceutical industry could contribute. Thus the expected ben-
</p>
<p>efi ts of the private partner through this partnership included interaction value

<p>(learning how a nonprofi t organization operates) and satisfy his interest in learning 
</p>
<p>how to operate in a developing country. With the support of PEPAL, the two part-
</p>
<p>ners were matched and introduced to each other based on the objectives of the 
</p>
<p>partners and potential fi t criteria. For example for the NGO the skillset that the pri-
</p>
<p>vate partner possessed, industry (healthcare) expertise,  and   interest in developing 
</p>
<p>regions were important criteria.  
</p>
<p>22.3.1.2     Evolution of the Partnership 
</p>
<p> The private  partner   joined Alliance Zambia as an advisor to the senior management 
</p>
<p>team, which allowed him to take a leadership position. Partnership management 
</p>
<p>tools and performance metrics initiated by the private partner through the form of 
</p>
<p>semi-annual surveys were used. Partners established trust, compatibility, comple-
</p>
<p>mentarity and commitment-based relationships. The relationships were straight, 
</p>
<p>equal, and built on trust. With  the   private partner being on the ground for the 1-year 
</p>
<p>period, partners had an opportunity to build close relations through daily communi-
</p>
<p>cation. For example, the private partner supported Alliance Zambia team to prepare 
</p>
<p>for one of the largest events, the National Prevention Convention by supporting and 
</p>
<p>empowering its employees to take on new roles such as public speaking and  succeed 
</p>
<p>during the event. This is an example of how with the help of the private partner, the 
</p>
<p>skills of the NGO&rsquo;s employees can be improved and their knowledge gap of busi-
</p>
<p>ness practices can be addressed (Samii and Van Wassenhove  2003 ).  
</p>
<p>22.3.1.3     Challenges and Outcomes 
</p>
<p> Unfortunately, in  the   midsummer the NGO experienced funding challenges. As a 
</p>
<p>result, there was a change in management and the new Executive Director had 
</p>
<p> different priorities. This is a common phenomenon in NGO supply chains which 
</p>
<p>often face diffi culties to attract and retain employees with management experience 
</p>
<p>because of funding issues (Thomas  2005 ; Gustavsson  2003 ). The fi nancial diffi cul-
</p>
<p>ties the International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Zambia faced jeopardized project goals. 
</p>
<p>Taking the limited available resources into account, the partners decided not to con-
</p>
<p>tinue with the collaboration and terminate it at  the   end of the programme at INSEAD.   
</p>
<p>22.3.2     Case 2: Partnership in Ukraine 
</p>
<p>  Ukraine&rsquo;s major   developmental challenges include underdeveloped infrastructure, 
</p>
<p>unstable political environment, corruption, and excessive bureaucracy. The country 
</p>
<p>has one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in Europe, an area in which the 
</p>
<p>NGO community is very active. The primary issues faced by the supply chains of 
</p>
<p>most NGOs operating in the area, including International HIV/AIDS Alliance in 
</p>
<p>Ukraine, were limited resources and strong competition for funding. 
</p>
<p>J. Balaisyte et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>495
</p>
<p>22.3.2.1     Formation of the Partnership 
</p>
<p> Five years after its foundation,    Alliance Ukraine expanded by establishing a subsid-
</p>
<p>iary that hosts the Regional Technical Support Hub (TS Hub) for the Eastern Europe 
</p>
<p>and Central Asia region. The TS Hub provides technical support services to a wide 
</p>
<p>range of NGOs, acting in this way as a new product that Alliance Ukraine can offer 
</p>
<p>to other NGOs, and serves as a mechanism for the International HIV/AIDS Alliance 
</p>
<p>to obtain additional funding for their operations. 
</p>
<p> Before joining the EDP, the Alliance Ukraine team was struggling to turn the 
</p>
<p>hub into a sustainable business entity. Alliance Ukraine easily identifi ed the TS Hub 
</p>
<p>as the project for this partnership. The potential benefi ts of engaging in the partner-
</p>
<p>ship were of resource nature (to increase their funding) and interaction value 
</p>
<p>(acquiring marketing skills and project development from interaction). 
</p>
<p> The private partner Tibotec has a strong CSR culture. It was a good match for 
</p>
<p>Alliance Ukraine&rsquo;s needs in terms of skillset and expertise, as they had extensive 
</p>
<p>experience in marketing and project development. Tibotec was interested in the 
</p>
<p>partnership as a career development opportunity for its senior staff. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>corporate partners saw this partnership as an opportunity for improving their under-
</p>
<p>standing of the epidemic in  Ukraine which   may facilitate their future operations in 
</p>
<p>this new market as well as collaboration with the NGO sector. Tibotec partners 
</p>
<p>supported Alliance Ukraine with market growth strategy expertise by sharing mar-
</p>
<p>ket analysis and its strategic planning knowledge. The potential benefi t for the 
</p>
<p> private partner was interaction value (learning how a nonprofi t organization oper-
</p>
<p>ates,    employees&rsquo; personal interest and motivation).  
</p>
<p>22.3.2.2     Evolution of the Partnership 
</p>
<p> With the support  of   PEPAL, the two partners were matched and introduced to each 
</p>
<p>other based on their objectives and potential fi t criteria. For example for the NGO 
</p>
<p>the skillset that the private partner possessed, their social mission and the interest of 
</p>
<p>the private partner in developing regions were important fi t criteria. Table  22.1  
</p>
<p>presents the partner selection criteria for this partnership. 
</p>
<p> During the kick-off week at INSEAD, the project team divided roles, leadership 
</p>
<p>and responsibilities, and also agreed on the interaction patterns. The project team 
</p>
<p>had established a routine of bi-weekly telephone conferences that helped partners 
</p>
<p>build a strong relationship and confront all issues openly. After the fi rst 2 months of 
</p>
<p>the partnership, the hub manager left the organization and a temporary manager 
</p>
<p>from the International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Ukraine was assigned. 
</p>
<p> After the new TS Hub manager joined the HIV/AIDS Alliance in Ukraine, the 
</p>
<p>private partners came to Ukraine and spent 1 week working with the new TS Hub 
</p>
<p>manager and her team in order to readjust project goals. The project team developed 
</p>
<p> good   relationships. The partners shared the leadership of the project, with the  private 
</p>
<p>partner taking the lead on communication and mentoring,    and the NGO partner 
</p>
<p>leading the direction of the project.

</p>
<p>22.3.2.3     Challenges and Outcomes 
</p>
<p> The fi rst 2 months of  the   project were challenging since the International HIV/
</p>
<p>AIDS Alliance team in Ukraine did not have a clear direction regarding the hub, a 
</p>
<p>typical characteristic of NGO supply chains (Maon et al.  2009 ). However, partners 
</p>
<p>managed to overcome this challenge by developing their strategic direction. One 
</p>
<p>year later, the partnership proved to be very collaborative with strong commitment 
</p>
<p>and trust coming from both sides. The TS Hub became a fully functional and reve-
</p>
<p>nue generating unit and partners  maintained   good relationships.

<p> Uganda is a  landlocked   country in East Africa with more than 35 % of its popula-
</p>
<p>tion living on less than $1.25 a day 7 . Currently, 7.2 % of Uganda&rsquo;s population is 
</p>
<p>suffering from HIV/AIDS 8 . The high poverty of the population combined with the 
</p>
<p>lack of public resources spent on health services, increases the demand for NGO 
</p>
<p>services. 
</p>
<p>22.3.3.1     Formation of the Partnership 
</p>
<p> The  International   HIV/AIDS Alliance in Uganda has been present in the country 
</p>
<p>since 2005 with an objective to improve access to HIV/AIDS prevention means, 
</p>
<p>care treatment and support services to orphans and vulnerable children. Being a 
</p>
<p>young organization, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Uganda suffered from 
</p>
<p>their staff lacking project and program implementation skills, a common character-
</p>
<p>istic of NGO supply chains (Thomas  2005 ; Gustavsson  2003 ). Therefore, a partner-
</p>
<p>ship with the private sector was considered a good opportunity to improve project 
</p>
<p>management skills and acquire a commercial sector perspective. Tibotec was ready 
</p>
<p>to offer these capabilities and welcomed the project as an opportunity to engage in 
</p>
<p>a meaningful CSR initiative. Through this partnership, Alliance Uganda was seek-
</p>
<p>ing to acquire increased resource base (in order to improve the skills of their 
</p>
<p>employees). The benefi t for the private partner was associational value (through the 
</p>
<p>CSR initiative). 
</p>
<p> With the support of PEPAL, the two partners were matched and introduced to 
</p>
<p>each other based on the potential fi t criteria and their interests. Past experience of 
</p>
<p>the private partner in working with NGOs and in developing regions was  consid-
</p>
<p>ered   an advantage. Table  22.1  presents the partner selection criteria.

</p>
<p>22.3.3.2     Evolution of the Partnership 
</p>
<p> The partnership  evolved   through several phases. Partnership formation occurred 
</p>
<p>during the EDP at INSEAD where partners agreed to work on the project through 
</p>
<p>frequent communication over the phone and e-mails. At the beginning of the 
</p>
<p> project, private partners made a fi rst visit to Uganda, which was an eye-opening 
</p>
<p>experience. They realized that defi ning clear goals was not an easy task. The fi rst 
</p>
<p>4 months of the project were spent on discussions about how Tibotec could help 
</p>
<p>Alliance Uganda. Then fi nancial challenges arose for the NGO. The International 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDs Alliance in Uganda offi ce was downsized, including management. 
</p>
<p>The executive director left the NGO, leaving Tibotec without a leadership part-
</p>
<p>ner on the ground. 
</p>
<p> Following 2 months of struggle,  a   temporary project manager from the head-
</p>
<p>quarters of International HIV/AIDS Alliance stepped in to support the partner-
</p>
<p>ship and Alliance in Uganda while the headquarters of the HIV/AIDS Alliance 
</p>
<p>was supporting the hiring of the new executive director and project manager for 
</p>
<p>the partnership. Because of this change, the partners were forced to redefi ne the 
</p>
<p>goals of the supply chain partnership. Due to the fi nancial challenges, International 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS Alliance in Uganda decided to develop a Technical Support Hub (TS 
</p>
<p>Hub), designed to generate revenues as an additional service that Alliance in 
</p>
<p>Uganda could offer to other NGOs. Preparing a business plan and conducting 
</p>
<p>market research became the new partnership objectives. Nine months after the 
</p>
<p>beginning of the project, a new manager arrived at the NGO. The partners had to 
</p>
<p>go through the whole adjustment and relationship-building cycle again, which 
</p>
<p>negatively affected the project  development   dynamics, as described in the next 
</p>
<p>section.  
</p>
<p>22.3.3.3     Challenges and Outcomes 
</p>
<p> To sum-up,    despite a number of adjustments, it was hard for both sides to work on 
</p>
<p>the project with no leadership support coming from the Alliance Uganda side. 
</p>
<p>There was a lack of clarity in responsibilities and understanding by the Alliance 
</p>
<p>Uganda team on how to accomplish the goals of the supply chain partnership, and 
</p>
<p>misalignment of expectations on both sides. When the new executive director was 
</p>
<p>hired, due to fi nancial challenges and other priorities, he was not in a position to 
</p>
<p>engage in the partnership to the full extent. Therefore, without active leadership, 
</p>
<p>commitment, and support from the executive director, the project was not able to 
</p>
<p>make progress. 
</p>
<p> After 1-year of not being able to fi nd a common ground for collaboration, the 
</p>
<p>partners re-evaluated their efforts and decided to terminate  the   partnership. They 
</p>
<p>used the Programme&rsquo;s fi nal training week at INSEAD to meet face-to-face and take 
</p>
<p>this decision.

</p>
<p>22.4      Propositions and Research Implications 
</p>
<p> Four stages of collaboration in cross-sector partnerships are identifi ed by Austin 
</p>
<p>( 2000a ,  b ): philanthropic, transactional, integrative, and transformative. Our three 
</p>
<p>cross-sector partnerships are based on transfer of resources to one another. However, 
</p>
<p>our partnerships are not yet so advanced in order to co-create value or to make 
</p>
<p>changes at the societal level, even if these are their future goals. So our three part-
</p>
<p>nerships fall into the transactional stage. The forms of value identifi ed in our 
</p>
<p> partnerships are associational, transferred resource, interaction and synergetic value 
</p>
<p>as presented by Austin and Seitanidi ( 2012b , 2010a). 
</p>
<p> In this Section the three cases are analyzed using the fi ndings from the literature. 
</p>
<p>Section  22.4.1  presents the propositions that arise, while Sect.  22.4.2  discusses the 
</p>
<p>research implications. 
</p>
<p>22.4.1      Propositions 
</p>
<p> In this Section we use  the   framework developed in Sect.  22.2  (Fig.  22.2 ), which 
</p>
<p>depicts potential factors affecting the success of the cross-sector partnerships, and 
</p>
<p>the case studies conducted to identify the factors that affected the outcomes of the 
</p>
<p>three cross-sector partnerships. 
</p>
<p> Our analysis of the three cases revealed that during the partnership selection and 
</p>
<p>formation phase setting clear objectives for the supply chain partnership (relevant 
</p>
<p>to all cases), and having compatible and complementary partners regarding skills 
</p>
<p>and available resources (relevant to all cases) improves chances to achieve 
</p>
<p> partnership goals (Fig.  22.3 ). These fi ndings are supported by the literature on the

<p>importance of cultural fi t (Dahan et al.  2010 ), compatibility and complementarity of 
</p>
<p>skills (Austin and Seitanidi  2012a ,  b ; Berger et al.  2004 ) and resources (Kale and 
</p>
<p>Singh  2009 ). Taking into account these fi ndings, we form our Proposition 1.
</p>
<p>    Proposition 1 (P1)      During the partner selection and partnership formation phase, 
</p>
<p>improving  
</p>
<p>&bull;      Setting objectives   
</p>
<p>&bull;    Identifying the partnership potential (clear benefi ts to all partners)   
</p>
<p>&bull;    Identifying fi t criteria (between partner working styles and cultures, and clear 
</p>
<p>understanding of the skills and weaknesses on both sides)     
</p>
<p>  will have a positive impact on the success of cross-sector supply chain partnership   
</p>
<p>  I n all three case studies we found a link between the success of the partner selec-
</p>
<p>tion and partnership formation, and the partnership implementation and post- 
</p>
<p>formation management. For example, we fi nd that if the partnership potential is not 
</p>
<p>adequate during the partner selection and partnership formation phase (e.g., regard-
</p>
<p>ing available resources of the supply chain partnership) then the partnership during 
</p>
<p>the implementation  and   post-formation management phase faces challenges (all 
</p>
<p>three cases) and objectives, processes and responsibilities may need to be read-
</p>
<p>justed. These results are in accordance with the fi ndings of Kale and Singh ( 2009 ), 
</p>
<p>Austin and Seitanidi ( 2012b ) and Le Ber and Branzei ( 2010 ). 
</p>
<p> Taking into account these fi ndings, we form our Proposition 2. 
</p>
<p>  Proposition 2 (P2)      Improving the planning of the partner selection and partnership 
</p>
<p>formation phase will have a positive impact on the partnership implementation and 
</p>
<p>post-formation phase of the supply chain partnership.   
</p>
<p> The success of the three cross-sector partnerships depends on factors linked to 
</p>
<p>the partnership implementation and post-formation management phase. In all three 
</p>
<p>cases we fi nd that sustaining the commitment (evident in the Zambia and Ukraine 
</p>
<p>cases) (Shah and Swaminathan  2008 ), building trust and open relationship (as was 
</p>
<p>the case for all three partnerships) (Austin and Seitanidi  2012b ), having a detailed 
</p>
<p>map of leadership roles and responsibilities (evident in the Ukraine case) (Googins 
</p>
<p>and Rochlin  2000 ; Austin  2000b ; Bryson et al.  2006 ), establishing leadership sup-
</p>
<p>port (as in the Ukraine case) (Austin  2000a  and Waddock  1986 ), and having avail-
</p>
<p>able resources for the partnership implementation (which was a barrier for all three 
</p>
<p>cases) (Kale and Singh  2009 ) has a positive effect on achieving partnership objec-
</p>
<p>tives. Based on  these   observations, we form our Proposition 3. 
</p>
<p>  Proposition 3 (P3)      During the partnership implementation and post-formation 
</p>
<p>phase, improving  
</p>
<p>&bull;     C ommitment   
</p>
<p>&bull;    Trust and open relationship   
</p>
<p>&bull;    Having a detailed map of leadership roles and responsibilities   
</p>
<p>&bull;    Establishing leadership support   
</p>
<p>&bull;    Having available resources for the partnership     
</p>
<p>  will have a positive impact on the success of the cross-sector supply chain partnership

</p>
<p>  B y comparing the literature fi ndings (Fig.  22.2 ) with our three case study propo-
</p>
<p>sitions (Fig.  22.3 ), we observe that articulation of the social problem did not chal-
</p>
<p>lenge the partnership&rsquo;s success; perhaps this is due to the set-up of the EDP that 
</p>
<p>allowed clarifying the social problem early in the program. However, there was a 
</p>
<p>difference in the timing of the objectives. The partnership objectives were instru-
</p>
<p>mental for the partner selection and were set before the partnership implementation 
</p>
<p>started. On the contrary, the literature suggests that objectives are typically set later. 
</p>
<p> Finally, all three partnerships  were   challenged to measure the success of their 
</p>
<p>supply chain partnerships, both on an organization and partnership level. Corporate 
</p>
<p>partners did not establish any specifi c measures to track partnership impacts on their 
</p>
<p>organizations. For the NGOs, the positive impacts of the collaboration were attrib-
</p>
<p>uted to the success of the partnership in general. Observing our partnerships we 
</p>
<p>found that the main challenge for setting KPIs and monitoring performance was 
</p>
<p>related to the combination of several factors: partners&rsquo; inability of setting  objectives, 
</p>
<p>and constantly changing available resources and engagement of senior manage-
</p>
<p>ment. Partners often were not sure about their ultimate objectives or these  objectives 
</p>
<p>were too broad or ill-defi ned. Initially all partnerships had very ambitious goals 
</p>
<p>such as creating a new marketing strategy or designing a new business plan, that 
</p>
<p>often proved diffi cult to achieve. These factors affected the progress of the partner-
</p>
<p>ship, resulted in a need to readjust or change objectives, and affected the ability to 
</p>
<p>track partnership performance.  
</p>
<p>22.4.2      Research Implications 
</p>
<p> The analysis of the  three   cases also revealed that business and nonprofi t partner-
</p>
<p>ships are characterized by complexity due to the nature of NGO resource con-
</p>
<p>strained environment, uncertainty, and multiple trade-offs (Besiou and Van 
</p>
<p>Wassenhove  2015 ). Often NGOs are challenged by the resources that are required 
</p>
<p>in advance for the partnership to function properly. Uncertainty is refl ected in fi erce 
</p>
<p>competition among NGOs for limited funding, which makes the future of the NGO 
</p>
<p>employees insecure. In our cases the business partners were often left without any 
</p>
<p>support coming from the NGO side. Furthermore, due to the uncertainty of resource 
</p>
<p>availability, the objectives of the partnerships, the support coming from the leader-
</p>
<p>ship, the roles of the partners and their commitment change dynamically. There are 
</p>
<p>also time delays in building trust between the partners and improving their skills/
</p>
<p>capacity. Moreover, the partners need to deal with trade-offs between the short-term 
</p>
<p>losses of investing constrained resources and the long-term benefi ts of the social 
</p>
<p>cause. In &ldquo;uneasy&rdquo; partnerships, like the three cases discussed in this chapter, it may 
</p>
<p>be challenging to capture and monetize the value created by the supply chain part-
</p>
<p>nership. Value is often rather intangible, so setting quantitative KPIs may be hard. 
</p>
<p> We believe that there is an opportunity for OM/SCM research to dive into the 
</p>
<p>interesting environment of cross-sector partnerships. First, OM/SCM researchers 
</p>
<p>J. Balaisyte et al.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>501
</p>
<p>need to go to the fi eld to understand the constraints and the complex environment of 
</p>
<p>these partnerships. After mapping the territory, modeling could be used to better 
</p>
<p>understand the impact of the limited resources (for example lack of funding) on the 
</p>
<p>supply chain partnership. 
</p>
<p> Then the impact of different  decisions   and actions could be evaluated to maxi-
</p>
<p>mize the benefi ts of working together and building more effective partnerships. 
</p>
<p>Education in OM/SCM could also fi nd research in cross-sector supply chain part-
</p>
<p>nerships benefi cial. Examples of cross-sector partnerships could be used contrast-
</p>
<p>ing them to examples of commercial partnerships. The students could initially try 
</p>
<p>to explore the impact of constrained resources on the operations of the supply 
</p>
<p>chain partnership at a conceptual level and then capture the right trade-offs with 
</p>
<p>OM/SCM models. From a pedagogical perspective, students could also try to come 
</p>
<p>up with KPIs that could measure the social impact and the success of such 
</p>
<p>partnerships. 
</p>
<p> Our examples of cross-sector partnerships are characterized by stakeholders with 
</p>
<p>confl icting goals (private companies, NGOs and donors) (Van Wassenhove and 
</p>
<p>Besiou  2013 ). The private companies engage in such partnerships because of their 
</p>
<p>CSR strategy, while the NGOs use them as means to improve the skills of their 
</p>
<p>employees and improve their funding. Private sector supply chain partnerships also 
</p>
<p>face multiple challenges like incentive misalignment but what makes these issues 
</p>
<p>more challenging in cross-sector environments are limited resources and higher lev-
</p>
<p>els of uncertainty. For example NGO supply chains suffer from high turnover due 
</p>
<p>to limited funding (Thomas  2005 ; Gustavsson  2003 ). Moreover, as seen in our 
</p>
<p>cases, many of the partners were engaging for their fi rst time in a cross-sector 
</p>
<p> partnership and they had different expectations. So being part of such a partnership 
</p>
<p>may not be straightforward for all the partners, or even desirable for all employees, 
</p>
<p>an unfamiliar context for private supply chains. OM/SCM can also be used to map 
</p>
<p>the stakeholders&rsquo; dynamic goals and understand this context. For example Stadtler 
</p>
<p>and Van Wassenhove ( 2013 ) study the partnership between the humanitarian 
</p>
<p>Logistics Cluster and four logistics companies. Even if the four logistics companies 
</p>
<p>are competitors, when a disaster strikes they activate the supply chain partnership 
</p>
<p>and share resources to optimize the social benefi t. Broader issues from a supply 
</p>
<p>chain perspective need to be taken into account, like the strong commitment coming 
</p>
<p>from the partners. Collaborative game theory and system dynamics could be applied 
</p>
<p>in order to study the dynamic changes of the partner roles for different levels of 
</p>
<p>decentralization and competition coming from the funding in an effort to maximize 
</p>
<p>the benefi t of the partners. 
</p>
<p> The complexity and the unfamiliar context of the cross-sector supply chain part-
</p>
<p>nerships can lead to counterintuitive behavior (Besiou and Van Wassenhove  2014 ). 
</p>
<p>In our cases even if the partners had to face many challenges, their commitment was 
</p>
<p>really strong due to their belief in a social cause. Pedagogical cases in OM/SCM 
</p>
<p> discipline   could also be used here in order to study how the objective functions of 
</p>
<p>the supply chain partnership would change under such conditions.

</p>
<p>22.5      Conclusions and Practical Implications 
</p>
<p> Today increasingly more companies are under pressure to engage in corporate 
</p>
<p>social responsibility initiatives like partnerships with non-governmental organiza-
</p>
<p>tions. In response to increased practitioner interest on the topic, this chapter studies 
</p>
<p>three examples of cross-sector supply chain partnerships between pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies and healthcare focused NGOs. In this study we look at the factors that 
</p>
<p>affect the success of such partnerships, and identify the avenues for future research 
</p>
<p>on cross-sector partnerships for the OM/SCM discipline. 
</p>
<p> We hope that our fi ndings will be helpful to master-level students, academia, but 
</p>
<p>foremost to the actual practitioners in healthcare sector both on business and NGO 
</p>
<p>sides, who are already managing or planning to engage in cross-sector partnerships. 
</p>
<p> As observed from the three partnerships, engaging in cross-sector collaboration 
</p>
<p>requires substantial amount of resources and efforts that may not be straightforward 
</p>
<p>to all partners. Our framework and fi ndings can help practitioners manage the value 
</p>
<p>creation process better through cross-sector partnerships and answer the following 
</p>
<p>questions: How different partnering processes and  factors   (e.g., setting objectives) 
</p>
<p>affect value generation? How these different factors can be most effectively orga-
</p>
<p>nized during different phases of partnership (e.g., leadership)? How and in what 
</p>
<p>combination can partners use resources designated for partnering (e.g., available 
</p>
<p>resources)? What actions can help partners improve implementation of the partner-
</p>
<p>ship internally, externally and between partners (e.g., communication and commit-
</p>
<p>ment)? We hope that this study will support their efforts in setting-up partnerships 
</p>
<p>and will provide insights on how to build more effi cient collaboration. 
</p>
<p> To have a successful partnership, the  engagement process   needs to be supported 
</p>
<p>by the leadership. The benefi ts for each partner and for the social cause need to be 
</p>
<p>communicated to all employees; unclear communication and lack of commitment 
</p>
<p>can undermine the partnership&rsquo;s success. If the partners due to external constraints, 
</p>
<p>like lack of funding, lose their direct interest in the partnership, then resetting the 
</p>
<p>objectives of the supply chain partnership or changing the leadership roles may be 
</p>
<p>helpful. For example, in the case of the partnership in Uganda the initial goals con-
</p>
<p>cerned how to improve business related skills of employees. However, when the 
</p>
<p>NGO faced funding issues, the partners decided to set sustaining the service of the 
</p>
<p>TS Hub in order to increase their fi nancial resources as the new objective. 
</p>
<p> In addition, given the specifi cs and challenges presented by these partnerships, 
</p>
<p>characterized by multiple stakeholders with differing objectives, and the complexity 
</p>
<p>of the system in which they operate, we see ample of space for further research. We 
</p>
<p>believe that the trade-off between short-term goals of spending fewer resources and 
</p>
<p>the long-term goal of capacity building offers interesting research opportunities. 
</p>
<p> This chapter shows that for research on sustainable supply chains we need to take 
</p>
<p>into account all the other broader issues that should go beyond the traditional supply 
</p>
<p>chain perspective. It is in particular relevant in addressing healthcare management 
</p>
<p>issues in developing countries where actors face uncertainty due to  capacity constraints   
</p>
<p>such as funding and skills of their employees (Thomas  2005 ; Gustavsson  2003 ).

</p>
<p> In addition, the cross-sector supply chain partnerships are very different from 
</p>
<p>the ones developed between private partners. In the NGO context, SCM is of 
</p>
<p>increasing importance but it has been undervalued since NGOs often regard it as 
</p>
<p>an  auxiliary function   (Arminas  2005 ). In order to overcome this gap, private 
</p>
<p> companies have an opportunity through cross-sector supply chain partnerships to 
</p>
<p>help NGOs increase their resources and the exposure to SCM and management 
</p>
<p>related tools (Van Wassenhove  2006 ). In this way, the skills of the NGO employees 
</p>
<p>will improve and their knowledge gap will decrease (Samii and Van Wassenhove 
</p>
<p> 2003 ). At the same time the pharmaceutical companies engaged in such partner-
</p>
<p>ships will acquire valuable experience of operations in developing markets. 
</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary research combining OM/SCM discipline with behavioral, man-
</p>
<p>agement and strategy topics could be benefi cial to optimize the desired impact of 
</p>
<p>the partnership with the existing resources. 
</p>
<p> This research has some limitations. First, it is limited to three cases. This was 
</p>
<p>necessary to be able to focus only on one specifi c industry in order for the results to 
</p>
<p>be comparable, but the generalization of the fi ndings is limited. Second, more 
</p>
<p>research is needed to test the propositions.
